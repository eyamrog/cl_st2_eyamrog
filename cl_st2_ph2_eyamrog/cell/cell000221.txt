Title: An Amygdala Circuit Mediates Experience-Dependent Momentary Arrests during Exploration


Abstract: Summary

Exploration of novel environments ensures survival and evolutionary fitness. It is expressed through exploratory bouts and arrests that change dynamically based on experience. Neural circuits mediating exploratory behavior should therefore integrate experience and use it to select the proper behavioral output. Using a spatial exploration assay, we uncovered an experience-dependent increase in momentary arrests in locations where animals arrested previously. Calcium imaging in freely exploring mice revealed a genetically and projection-defined neuronal ensemble in the basolateral amygdala that is active during self-paced behavioral arrests. This ensemble was recruited in an experience-dependent manner, and closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of these neurons revealed that they are sufficient and necessary to drive experience-dependent arrests during exploration. Projection-specific imaging and optogenetic experiments revealed that these arrests are effected by basolateral amygdala neurons projecting to the central amygdala, uncovering an amygdala circuit that mediates momentary arrests in familiar places but not avoidance or anxiety/fear-like behaviors.

Section: Introduction

Exploration is highly conserved across species and can be constructed as the act of gathering information or resources from unknown surroundings ( Fonio et al., 2009 26. Fonio, E. ∙ Benjamini, Y. ∙ Golani, I. Freedom of movement and the stability of its unfolding in free exploration of mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :21335-21340 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore a self-paced process in which animals guide their behavior to learn about new environments. This behavior is fundamental for discovering new territories to gather food and water or find safe shelter; e.g., birds explore the territory before choosing a place to nest ( Mills and Wood-Gush, 1985 46. Mills, A.D. ∙ Wood-Gush, D.G. Pre-laying behaviour in battery cages Br. Poult. Sci. 1985; 26 :247-252 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Freire et al., 1996 29.

Many behavioral studies analyzing exploration in the lab use assays that depend on water- or food-deprived animals executing movements to ultimately find and consume food or water ( Fonio et al., 2009 26. Fonio, E. ∙ Benjamini, Y. ∙ Golani, I. Freedom of movement and the stability of its unfolding in free exploration of mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :21335-21340 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Benjamini et al., 2010 1. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Lipkind, D. ∙ Horev, G. ...

Vorhees, C.V. ∙ Williams, M.T. Assessing spatial learning and memory in rodents ILAR J. 2014; 55 :310-332 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ). Less is known about the self-paced moment-to-moment actions that govern exploration of novel environments in the absence of explicit reinforcers ( Tolman, 1948 74. Tolman, E.C. The Psychological Review Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men Psychol. Rev. 1948; 55 :189-208 Crossref Scopus (4012) PubMed Google Scholar ; Renner, 1990 57. Renner, M.J.

Redish, A.D. Vicarious trial and error Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :147-159 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Emergence exploratory paradigms were developed to study naturalistic exploratory behavior during transitions between familiar and novel environments ( Fonio et al., 2009 26. Fonio, E. ∙ Benjamini, Y. ∙ Golani, I. Freedom of movement and the stability of its unfolding in free exploration of mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :21335-21340 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Benjamini et al., 2011 2. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Fonio, E. ∙ Galili, T. ... Quantifying the buildup in extent and complexity of free exploration in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :15580-15587 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). These paradigms allow animals to explore a novel area in a self-paced manner, departing from a familiar one, and permit investigation of moment-to-moment exploratory dynamics during spatial familiarization as the animal performs defined trips from the familiar shelter. When facing novel surroundings and given freedom of movement, animals execute gradual and structured exploratory trips with development of a quantifiable behavioral gradient ( Benjamini et al., 2011 2. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Fonio, E. ∙ Galili, T. ... Quantifying the buildup in extent and complexity of free exploration in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :15580-15587 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Several reports show that a wide variety of species use specific locations, sometimes called “home bases,” as strategic points of reference from which the animal begins and terminates exploratory trips ( Eilam and Golani, 1989 22.

Quantifying the buildup in extent and complexity of free exploration in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :15580-15587 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). In exploration, home bases can be perceived as the origin of exploratory activity at the interface between known and unknown places, representing a key factor in understanding its general structure and organization ( Eilam and Golani, 1989 22. Eilam, D. ∙ Golani, I. Home base behavior of rats (Rattus norvegicus) Behav. Brain Res. 1989; 34 :121-199 Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar ; Golani et al., 1993 30.

Knots: attractive places with high path tortuosity in mouse open field exploration PLoS Comput. Biol. 2010; 6 :e1000638 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). These locations are characterized by more frequent behavioral arrests than other areas explored by an animal ( Eilam and Golani, 1989 22. Eilam, D. ∙ Golani, I. Home base behavior of rats (Rattus norvegicus) Behav. Brain Res. 1989; 34 :121-199 Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar ; Golani et al., 1993 30. Golani, I. ∙ Benjamini, Y. ∙ Eilam, D. Stopping behavior: constraints on exploration in rats (Rattus norvegicus) Behav. Brain Res. 1993; 53 :21-33 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that exploratory motor dynamics are influenced by spatial knowledge. Spontaneous arrests are distinct from freezing responses because they are momentary, occur voluntarily in familiar places, and are not triggered by any apparent aversive stimuli ( Phillips and LeDoux, 1992 52. Phillips, R.G. ∙ LeDoux, J.E. Differential contribution of amygdala and hippocampus to cued and contextual fear conditioning Behav. Neurosci. 1992; 106 :274-285 Crossref Scopus (2709) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roelofs, 2017 58. Roelofs, K. Freeze for action: Neurobiological mechanisms in animal and human freezing Philos. Trans.

Neural circuitry for behavioural arrest Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 372 :20160197 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, this self-initiated type of arrest may be critical for the deliberation process in familiar/safe places while the animal prepares for the next exploratory trip ( Eilam and Golani, 1989 22. Eilam, D. ∙ Golani, I. Home base behavior of rats (Rattus norvegicus) Behav. Brain Res. 1989; 34 :121-199 Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar ; Clark et al., 2006 11.

Neurosci. 2016; 17 :147-159 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given that exploratory actions such as arrests depend on knowledge of the environment, the neural circuits mediating this behavior should integrate experience-dependent contextual information and use it to select a proper behavioral output. The main input structure of the amygdala, the basolateral nucleus (BLA), has been shown to be involved in the learning of contextual information related to appetitive and aversive experiences ( Phillips and LeDoux, 1992 52.

Previous studies suggest that the amygdala plays a much broader role in integrating novel and familiar sensory stimuli in humans and monkeys; lesions of the BLA impair familiarity recognition ( Wilson and Rolls, 1993 78.

In the present study, we developed an emergence assay to investigate the dynamics of exploration in mice and, in particular, the neural mechanisms underlying momentary arrests during exploration. Using behavioral analyses, circuit mapping, single-cell calcium imaging, and closed-loop optogenetic approaches, we provide evidence of recruitment of a well-defined BLA neuronal population that mediates experience-dependent momentary arrests. Further analyses revealed that BLA neurons active during exploratory momentary arrests project to the CEA and that this neuronal population does not overlap beyond random with populations that are active during other moments of immobility, such as freezing. Activation and inhibition of the BLA neuronal population directly projecting to the CEA revealed that this projection mediates momentary behavioral arrests during exploration. Furthermore, we show that the role of the amygdala in modulating exploratory arrests was not directly associated with changes in the place value or place preference or anxiety/fear-like behavior.

Section: Results

We investigated the progression of self-paced exploratory dynamics by analyzing the behavior of animals as they explored a 100-cm circular arena, departing from a familiar 20-cm arena, for 5 consecutive days (7 mice; Figure 1 A; Figure S1 ). Although animals performed a constant number of trips from the small to the big arena, the duration of the trips and the area explored increased gradually during the 5 experimental days ( Figure 1 B; Figure S1 ; Videos S1 A and S1B). As shown by our results and others ( Benjamini et al., 2011 2. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Fonio, E. ∙ Galili, T. ... Quantifying the buildup in extent and complexity of free exploration in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :15580-15587 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), the complexity of the trajectories increased in late exploration ( Figure S1 ). Our data confirm that the developed behavioral assay can be used to study gradual progression of exploration.

To investigate the activity of excitatory pyramidal neurons in the BLA in this assay ( Figure S1 ), we used a mouse line that expresses Cre recombinase in a population of those BLA neurons: the NL189 line ( NL189 BLA neurons; Figure 1 C; Figure S2 ; Videos S1 C and S1D; STAR Methods ). After injecting a conditional AAV virus expressing GCamp6f in the BLA of NL189 Cre + animals ( Chen et al., 2013 8. Chen, T.-W. ∙ Wardill, T.J. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity Nature. 2013; 499 :295-300 Crossref Scopus (4197) PubMed Google Scholar ), we implanted a gradient index lens in seven mice ( Figures S3 A–S3E). Neuronal calcium activity was imaged from 1,435 NL189 BLA neurons for 5 days (average neurons/animal/day = 41 ± 4.85; Figure S3 E) using a miniaturized one-photon fluorescence microscope in freely exploring animals and processed with the constrained non-negative matrix factorization for endoscopic data (CNMF-E) algorithm ( Figure 1 D; Figures S3 A–S3E; Video S1 E; STAR Methods ; Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016 53. Pnevmatikakis, E.A. ∙ Soudry, D. ∙ Gao, Y. ... Simultaneous Denoising, Deconvolution, and Demixing of Calcium Imaging Data Neuron. 2016; 89 :285-299 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We observed that a large population of simultaneously recorded NL189 BLA neurons had coincident, transient moments of increases in activity that corresponded to moments when the speed of the animals decreased ( Figure 1 E). Overall, the activity of the entire population of NL189 BLA neurons was inversely cross-correlated with speed ( Figure 1 F; STAR Methods ). A rather large proportion of single neurons was activated at low speed (negative cross-correlation [anti-CC]) compared with high-speed (positive cross-correlation [CC]) neurons ( Figure 1 G). Another analytical approach, the spike-triggering average, confirmed a large proportion of NL189 BLA neurons to be active during decreased movement speed ( Figures S3 F and S3G). Using a segmentation algorithm ( Benjamini et al., 2010 1. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Lipkind, D. ∙ Horev, G. ... Ten ways to improve the quality of descriptions of whole-animal movement Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2010; 34 :1351-1365 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S1 G–S1I; STAR Methods ), we were able to detect the transition between movements and momentary arrests ( Figure 1 H). Our analysis considered all spontaneous arrests of an animal in the small and big arenas. These arrests were momentary (average duration in the big arena, 1.11 ± 0.21 s; in the small arena, 2.2 ± 0.23 s; average latency to arrest, 0.68 ± 0.01 s; Figures S1 J–S1L) and were usually followed by an increase in the angular speed of the head and a change in the direction of motion ( Figures S1 M–S1P; Videos S1 F and S1G), suggestive of vicarious trial and error behavior ( Muenzinger and Gentry, 1931 47. Muenzinger, K.F. ∙ Gentry, E. Tone discrimination in white rats J. Comp. Psychol. 1931; 12 :195-206 Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar ; Tolman, 1939 73. Tolman, E.C. Prediction of vicarious trial-and-error by means of the schematic sow-bug Psychol. Rev. 1939; 46 :318-336 Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar ; Redish, 2016 55. Redish, A.D. Vicarious trial and error Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :147-159 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). In combination with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Z- score analysis to sort neuronal activity between behavioral states, we found that a large proportion of NL189 BLA neurons was positively modulated (active) during the transition between movement and spontaneous arrests compared with the negatively modulated (inhibited) neuronal population ( Figures 1 I–1K; STAR Methods ). The majority of arrested NL189 BLA neurons were active before arrest (latency of −0.29 ± 0.01 s; Figure 1 K). Overall, these results show that a large subpopulation of BLA principal neurons, NL189 BLA neurons, is active before and during behavioral arrests.
To test whether the activity of NL189 BLA neurons is causally related to behavioral arrests, we injected a conditional AAV virus expressing channelrhodopsin hChR2(H134R [ChR]) and YFP into the BLA. Optogenetic stimulation of NL189 BLA neurons using three different light patterns (1×, one 10-ms pulse; 2×, two 10-ms pulses at 20 Hz; 5×, five 10-ms pulses at 20 Hz; STAR Methods ) showed a strong and reliable effect on eliciting neuronal activity in slice ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Figures S4 A–S4D). Next we performed closed-loop optogenetic stimulation in which the LED on was triggered ∼33% of the time during bouts where the animal was moving and had accelerated for at least 100 ms in the ChR and control group (on trials; Figures 2 C–2F; STAR Methods ). The 66% of trials when light was not delivered served as within-animal controls (off trials; Figures 2 F–2J). Acceleration-locked, closed-loop optogenetic activation of NL189 BLA neurons using the three aforementioned optogenetic protocols decreased the speed of the animals tested in comparison with off trials and control animals (significant ∼400–500 ms after stimulation onset; Figures 2 F–2K; Figures S4 E–S4H; Video S1 H). The same stimulation protocol was ineffective in eliciting any evident change in speed in control animals ( Figures 2 G–2K; Figures S4 E–S4H). Closed-loop optogenetic activation of NL189 BLA neurons in the ChR group elicited a significant increase in behavioral arrests following stimulation ( Figure 2 M). The average duration of arrests resulting from the 1×, 2×, and 5× stimulation protocols was 0.57 ± 0.08 s, 0.64 ± 0.11 s, and 0.47 ± 0.08 s, respectively, suggesting that optogenetic activation of NL189 BLA neurons triggered momentary arrests and not freezing (a more prolonged state; Herry et al., 2008 32. Herry, C. ∙ Ciocchi, S. ∙ Senn, V. ... Switching on and off fear by distinct neuronal circuits Nature. 2008; 454 :600-606 Crossref Scopus (748) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tovote et al., 2016 76. Tovote, P. ∙ Esposito, M.S. ∙ Botta, P. ... Midbrain circuits for defensive behaviour Nature. 2016; 534 :206-212 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further clarify whether longer activation could lead to prolonged freezing-like arrest, we tested different stimulation protocols with various stimulation lengths (from 10 ms up to 2 s). Optogenetic activation of NL189 BLA neurons using 1, 2, 5, 10, and 40 pulses (pulse duration, 10 ms) at 20 Hz (durations of 10 ms to 2 s) caused arrests with a duration of less than 1 s and no significant effect in arrest duration between protocols ( Figure 2 N), suggesting that activity in these neurons facilitates momentary arrests but not long periods of immobility or freezing. Importantly, there was no difference between the overall count of arrests throughout the behavioral session for the ChR versus the control group ( Figure S4 L), from which it can be deduced that the arrests were not caused by the animal freezing in other locations or generalization of immobility in that session ( Figure S4 L). It is important to note that stimulation was spatially sparse in the large arena and not triggered in every trial (∼66% of the trials were light off). Additionally, classical analysis to detect anxiety-like behavior showed that the most intense optogenetic stimulation (5×) did not have a consistent effect on the speed at times other than during from LED on stimulation, nor did it materially alter the average distance of the mouse from the center of the arena ( Figure 2 L; Figures S4 I–S4K). In summary, direct optogenetic stimulation of NL189 BLA neurons during ongoing movement reduces speed and promotes momentary arrests but does not have any effect on overall light-unlocked speed, arrest count, or anxiety-like behavior.
Subsequently, to test loss of function, we adopted an optogenetic method using the inhibitory opsin Jaws ( Chuong et al., 2014 9. Chuong, A.S. ∙ Miri, M.L. ∙ Busskamp, V. ... Noninvasive optical inhibition with a red-shifted microbial rhodopsin Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :1123-1129 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ) to transiently silence NL189 BLA neurons ( Figures 3 A–3C; Figure S4 ; STAR Methods ). Contrary to the ChR experiments, speed- and acceleration-locked closed-loop optogenetic silencing of NL189 BLA neurons (2 s of red light) revealed an increase in movement speed in comparison with off trials and control animals ( Figures 3 D–3G). To investigate whether NL189 BLA neurons are important not only to trigger but also to maintain behavioral arrests, we designed a closed-loop optogenetic experiment where we applied 2 s of optogenetic inhibition when animals arrested for at least 500 ms ( Figures 3 H–3J). Similar to the manipulation of NL189 BLA neurons during movements, we found that silencing triggered by 500-ms arrest causes an increase in starting speed compared with control conditions ( Figures 3 H and 3I). However, this silencing of NL189 BLA neurons did not cause changes in arrest duration compared with the control condition ( Figure 3 J), indicating that their activity is related to inducing but not to maintaining immobility. This is consistent with our findings that arrest-related NL189 BLA neurons are active before arrests and not during immobility and that their activation induces arrests but that prolonged activation does not lead to prolonged immobility, further suggesting that the activity of NL189 BLA neurons induces momentary arrest during exploration.
After assessing the direct involvement of NL189 BLA neurons on movement speed and momentary behavioral arrests, we wanted to find out whether their activity changes as movement dynamics in exploration change with experience. As mentioned previously, in our emergence exploratory assay, animals freely explore a novel arena starting from a familiar home shelter in 5 sessions, one per day, from days 1–5 ( Figures 1 A and 1B). In line with a process of familiarization, exploratory arrests increased across days in the 100-cm arena, whereas their number is kept constant in the more familiar 20-cm-arena ( Figures 4 A–4C). The increase in exploratory arrests was related to the number of exploratory trips ( Figure S5 A). Voluntary arrests started to appear at the 26 th exploratory trip, when 75.81% ± 7.485% of the area was explored ( Figure S5 A, gray dashed line).
These data indicate that a certain knowledge of the environment is required before voluntary exploratory arrests start occurring. We therefore investigated whether the onset of experience-dependent exploratory arrests was based on the number of visits to specific places. First we quantified the distance between the arrests’ coordinates ( Figure 4 E) and found that they accumulate within a distance of 4 cm ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Second, to understand whether such arrests emerged based on the experience at specific locations, we tracked the visits of the animal (referred to here as spatial experience) to a defined region of interest where the animal had arrested at least once (ROI arrest ; Figure 4 F). The diameter of the ROI arrest was chosen based on the most common distance between arrests, 4 cm ( Figure 4 E). Interestingly, the cumulative exploratory arrests as well as arrest duration increased upon entrance to these ROI arrest ( Figure S5 B and S5C; STAR Methods ). Accordingly, the probability of arrest (P arrest ) increased upon spatial experience in ROI arrest compared with other ROIs of similar size (shuffled data; Figure 4 G). Furthermore, the inter-entrance interval (IEI; seconds) to ROI arrest decreased with the number of visits, but it remained constant in ROIs where the animal had never arrested before (ROI Non-Arrest ; Figure 4 H). Additionally, the entrance preference to ROI arrest was higher compared with ROI Non-Arrest (preference ratio: (ROI arrest - ROI Non-Arrest )/(ROI arrest + ROI Non-Arrest ) = 0.3279 ± 0.04162). To understand whether visuospatial information is required for experience-dependent arrests, we performed the behavioral assay in the dark using infrared light versus light context (the same light intensity as for the rest of the behavioral experiments; Figures S5 D–S5F). We found that, in the dark, animals arrest more, and, importantly, they did not arrest preferentially in places with which they were familiar with; they arrested as much in places where they visited 1–5 times as in places where they visited 16–20 times ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Therefore, the experience-dependent arrest is dependent on visual input. These results show that exploratory arrests depend on an interaction between spatial and behavioral experience because mice tend to momentarily arrest in places they visited previously and where they arrested previously.
Next we sought to understand whether the neuronal activity of NL189 BLA neurons encoding self-paced arrests was modulated by spatial experience ( Figures S5 G–S5L; STAR Methods ). First we used three separate analyses (ROC, CC, and event-triggering average) and observed an increase in neurons active during the deceleration phase or arrest from day 1 to day 5 ( Figures S5 G–S5K). The activity of arrest NL189 BLA neurons was positively correlated with the daily arrest count ( Figure S5 K). Subsequently, we sorted pure arrest NL189 BLA neurons by selecting them based on the positive ROC- and anti-CC-based analysis during exploration of the big and small arena (significant neurons; Figure S5 L; STAR Methods ). We found a substantial increase in the proportion of significant NL189 BLA neurons encoding self-paced arrests and inversely cross-correlated with speed across days of exploration in the big arena ( Figure S5 L). To understand whether the arrest-related activity appeared based on fine spatial experience, we used two separate measures to track the overall activation of significant NL189 BLA neurons during early (1–5) and late (16–20) entrances to ROI arrest ( Figures 4 I–4O; Figure S5 M and S5N): (1) the magnitude of their calcium activity ( Figures 4 I–4M; Figure S5 M) and (2) the fraction of significant neurons active at the time of spatial crossing (using a Z- score analysis; Figures 4 N and 4O). We found that the magnitude of the neuronal activity of significant NL189 BLA neurons increased with the number of visits to ROI arrest (the ROI where they arrest at least once; Figure 4 J). The fraction of significant NL189 BLA neurons and their probability to be active also increased with experience ( Figure 4 N). Importantly, we also calculated the same measures controlling for the same number of arrests in early and late visits (5) by considering only visits in which animals arrested at that location ( Figures 4 K–4M and 4O; Figure S5 ). Again, we found that significant neurons were more active in terms of peak calcium activity in late visits than early visits and that their proportion increased with experience ( Figures 4 K–4M and 4O; Figure S5 ). Overall, these data demonstrate that the number and the activity of arrest NL189 BLA neurons increased when animals visited familiar locations where they arrested before during exploration (and did not reflect solely arrests in locomotion; Figure S5 ).
Overall, these findings reveal that NL189 BLA neurons encoding self-paced behavioral arrests are recruited in an experience-dependent manner during exploration and tend to fire in familiar locations where animals arrested previously.
To investigate the necessity of NL189 BLA neurons for animals to arrest in locations that they visited and where they arrested before, we performed location-specific optogenetic silencing using Jaws in the emergence exploratory paradigm ( Figure 5 ; STAR Methods ). We observed that animals expressing Jaws in the BLA arrested less than the controls after crossing the ROI on ( Figure 5 C). Importantly, this was not because they avoided the area because the daily number of entrances to this ROI did not differ between the two experimental groups ( Figure 5 D). To understand whether this effect was spatially restricted to amygdala silencing, we measured cumulative arrests based on the spatial experience from crossing the ROI on and ROI off (number of visits to ROIs; Figure 5 E; Figure S6 ). In accordance with the previous results, cumulative arrests increased based on spatial experience ( Figure 5 E). However, cumulative arrests were decreased drastically at the entrance to the ROI on in the Jaws versus control group but remained unaffected in the ROI off ( Figure 5 E; Figure S6 ). During a probe test (P) administered on day 6, where no light was turned on in the ROI on , we observed that the arrest count was initially higher in the control compared with the Jaws group but normalized after 25 visits ( Figures S6 P and S6Q). No significant difference was observed for the entrance to ROI off between Jaws and control mice ( Figure S6 L). Furthermore, we calculated the preference ratio between the entrances to ROI on and ROI off and found no significant difference between the control and Jaws group during the probe test in day 6 ( Figure 5 F), again suggesting that the manipulation that affected exploratory arrests based on spatial/behavioral experience did not affect the value of the ROI ( Namburi et al., 2015 48.

Organization of Valence-Encoding and Projection-Defined Neurons in the Basolateral Amygdala Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :905-918 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). No place avoidance or preference was induced by silencing NL189 BLA neurons during exploration or performing a classical real-time preference assay ( Figure S6 H–S6S; Jain et al., 2012 34. Jain, A. ∙ Dvorkin, A. ∙ Fonio, E. ... Validation of the dimensionality emergence assay for the measurement of innate anxiety in laboratory mice Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2012; 22 :153-163 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, although the preference ratio for the duration and number of visits to the ROI on versus ROI off did not differ between the Jaws and control groups in the place preference chamber, we observed a clear increase in speed at ROI on entrance during the conditioning day upon silencing of NL189 BLA neurons (red LED on at entrance of ROI on ; Figure S6 T), in line with our previous results.
The emergence assay helped us to clarify that location-specific silencing of NL189 BLA neurons decreases the accumulation of arrest in a specific area. Because location-locked optogenetic silencing might have a general effect in the development of arrest preference, we also calculated the cumulative count of arrests in the entire big arena as well as during exploration of the big arena when the light was off. We found no difference in the number of arrests between Jaws and control animals ( Figure S6 O). Additionally, we performed an experiment to inhibit NL189 BLA neurons in random locations and found no changes in cumulative arrests in both groups ( Figure S6 U).
Combined, these results show that NL189 BLA neurons are fundamental for development of experience-dependent arrests in defined familiar places where animals have arrested before. On the other hand, this neuronal population does not affect place preference or have an effect on prolonged behavioral states.
Classical and recent studies demonstrated that electrical and optogenetic stimulation of the main output structure of the amygdala and CEA as well as direct optogenetic stimulation of different neuronal subtypes in this brain area induces unconditional immobility and a decrease in track length ( Ciocchi et al., 2010 10.

Neurosci. 2015; 18 :1493-1500 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on this, we investigated whether the specific projection of NL189 BLA neurons to the CEA (CEA-projecting NL189 BLA neurons) could encode and directly elicit behavioral arrests. We first confirmed that the fiber density of NL189 BLA neurons was higher in the CEA than in other output structures, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and striatum (Str; Figures S7 A–S7D). Using optogenetic stimulation in slice recordings, we found robust excitatory efferents from the BLA to different CEA neuronal populations that can be likely candidates to participate in triggering arrests ( Figures S7 E–S7M; STAR Methods ; Roseberry et al., 2016 60.

To investigate whether CEA-projecting NL189 BLA neurons ( NL189 BLA-CEA neurons) are active during momentary arrests, we performed single-cell calcium imaging in seven freely moving animals during the exploratory emergence paradigm (n = 108 neurons; Figures 6 A–6C; Figures S8 A–S8D). After aligning the activity of these neurons with arrest onset ( Figure 6 B), we found that the majority of NL189 BLA-CEA neurons were active during spontaneous arrests (fraction active = 0.713 ± 0.1; Figure 6 C). Importantly, we found virtually no neurons with decreased activity at arrest onset, indicating that NL189 BLA-CEA neurons are active during momentary arrests. In addition, bulk calcium imaging revealed that the overall activity of NL189 BLA-CEA neurons transiently rises during arrest compared with movement onset (peak activity during arrest = 1.46 ± 0.27; peak activity during movement = 0.07 ± 0.32; ∗ p = 0.0247 by paired two-tailed t test; n = 4 mice; Figures S8 A–S8D). Importantly, bulk imaging of BLA neurons projecting to the dorsal Str (BLA-Str), an important region involved in voluntary movements, did not show a significant change in bulk fluorescence during arrest onset ( Figure S8 E). These experiments demonstrate that NL189 BLA-CEA neurons are specifically active during momentary arrest onset.
CEA has been implicated in freezing ( Ehrlich et al., 2009 18. Ehrlich, I. ∙ Humeau, Y. ∙ Grenier, F. ... Amygdala inhibitory circuits and the control of fear memory Neuron. 2009; 62 :757-771 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (723) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ciocchi et al., 2010 10. Ciocchi, S. ∙ Herry, C. ∙ Grenier, F. ... Encoding of conditioned fear in central amygdala inhibitory circuits Nature. 2010; 468 :277-282 Crossref Scopus (707) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested whether the NL189 BLA-to-CEA neurons active before momentary arrests during exploration were the same as the ones active during freezing by performing single-cell calcium imaging in freely moving animals during exploration in the emergence assay and fear conditioning in the same animals ( STAR Methods ; Figures S8 F–S8J). One day after fear conditioning, we were able to reliably elicit freezing bouts with 30-s CS + (n = 7; Figure S8 G). To allow the same statistical power, we sorted arrest and freezing neurons using the same number of arrest and freezing bout onsets during exploration and fear tests. Less than 50% of the NL189 BLA-CEA neurons were active at the onset of freezing bouts, and about 30% were negatively modulated by freezing ( Figure S8 I), contrasting the results obtained during exploratory arrests, where the majority of BLA-CEA neurons were positively modulated and there were virtually no negatively modulated neurons ( Figure 6 C). NL189 BLA-CEA neurons that increased activity during arrest did not correspond to neurons showing increased activity during freezing ( Figure S8 J). The P arrest NL189 BLA-CEA neurons being activated during freezing, inhibited during freezing, or not modulated by freezing was similar; the overlap between these populations was no different than expected by chance ( Figure S8 J; p > 0.05 by Monte Carlo simulations; 10,000 samples were used to generate a distribution of the number of overlapping neurons for arrest and freezing, assuming random assignment).
Next we targeted NL189 BLA neurons projecting to the CEA during speed- and acceleration-locked closed-loop optogenetic stimulation ( Figure 7 A). Similar to the optogenetic stimulation of the entire population of NL189 BLA neurons, CEA-projecting NL189 BLA neurons induced a transient decrease in speed in the ChR group ( Figures 7 B–7D), whereas their transient inhibition facilitated movement (Jaws versus control group; Figures S8 R–S8T). This change in movement speed was not observed in the control group ( Figures 6 F and 6G) or by stimulating neurons projecting to the Str ( Figures S8 K, S8L, S8R, and S8T).
We also assessed whether location-locked closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of NL189 BLA-CEA neurons was able to affect the development of experience-dependent exploratory arrests. We found that the number of arrests increased during the acquisition days in the ChR versus the control group ( Figures S8 M–S8Q). Again, this manipulation did not change the number of entrances to ROI on ( Figure S8 P). In addition, no differences were observed in cumulative arrests, entrances to the ROI off previously ROI on and preference ratio between ChR and control animals during the probe test (probe, P) ( Figures S8 O–S8Q). Additionally, location-locked closed-loop silencing of NL189 BLA-CEA neurons significantly decreased cumulative arrests during acquisition without impairing the number of visits to the ROI on ( Figures 7 E–7G) and the preference ratio between ROI on and ROI off on the probe test ( Figure 7 H). Our findings demonstrate that CEA-projecting NL189 BLA neurons are essential for triggering self-paced behavioral arrests independent of long-term effects on locomotion or place preference.

Section: Discussion

The results presented here show that a genetically and projection-defined amygdala neuronal ensemble in the BLA mediates momentary arrests during exploration that emerge in an experience-dependent manner when animals familiarize themselves with a novel environment. A combination of behavioral analyses, calcium imaging, and state-locked closed-loop optogenetic manipulations revealed that NL189 BLA neurons control movement speed and momentary arrests via their projection to the CEA. The recruitment of this neuronal population gradually increased in an experience-dependent manner as exploration progressed, primarily in specific areas that animals had visited multiple times and where they had arrested before. Transient loss of function of NL189 BLA neurons led to suppression of momentary arrests, highlighting the fundamental role of this population in experience-dependent arrest. Importantly, these arrests were not associated with valence or anxiety/fear-related behaviors. These results unveil a dual role of the amygdala as a novelty/familiarity detector and as an effector circuit with the ability to drive or suppress spontaneous movements based on spatial experience during exploratory behavior.
Exploration is required to gain knowledge about a new environment. Unrestrained spatial exploratory behavior can be structured into defined trips toward the unknown ( Fonio et al., 2009 26. Fonio, E. ∙ Benjamini, Y. ∙ Golani, I. Freedom of movement and the stability of its unfolding in free exploration of mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :21335-21340 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our behavioral findings show that animals choose to momentarily arrest in specific locations with which they became familiar and where they arrested previously after exploration. This was confirmed by the fact that spatial experience-dependent accumulation of behavioral arrests is influenced by the dimension of the environment (faster in the small versus the big arena; Figure S5 ) and impaired in the absence of visual inputs (dark versus light condition; Figure S5 ). These findings are consistent with the novelty management model ( Gordon et al., 2014 31. Gordon, G. ∙ Fonio, E. ∙ Ahissar, E. Emergent exploration via novelty management J. Neurosci. 2014; 34 :12646-12661 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Momentary arrests in familiar places can potentially be decision points underlying a vicarious trial and error behavior ( Redish, 2016 55. Redish, A.D. Vicarious trial and error Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :147-159 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thompson et al., 2018 72. Thompson, S.M. ∙ Berkowitz, L.E. ∙ Clark, B.J. Behavioral and neural subsystems of rodent exploration Learn. Motiv. 2018; 61 :3-15 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), given that animals initiate and terminate exploratory trips from these locations and changed head and trajectory orientation after the arrest ( Figure S1 ). In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been shown that a variety of hippocampal neurons encode past, current space, and upcoming spatial trajectory sequences during periods of immobility in an open field ( Kay et al., 2016 38. Kay, K. ∙ Sosa, M. ∙ Chung, J.E. ... A hippocampal network for spatial coding during immobility and sleep Nature. 2016; 531 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Redish, 2016 55. Redish, A.D. Vicarious trial and error Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :147-159 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ).
One of the challenges in understanding neural implementation of experience-dependent behavioral exploration was to identify neuronal circuits that could simultaneously participate in processing of novelty/familiarity inputs and also shape movement dynamics. Although it has been hypothesized that the hippocampal formation and other brain regions comprising the medial temporal lobe are fundamental in familiarity recognition ( Yonelinas, 2002 81.

ROC in animals: uncovering the neural substrates of recollection and familiarity in episodic recognition memory Conscious.

On the other hand, other independent studies have shown that the amygdala is directly involved in contextual learning, novelty, and familiarity detection but also that it is tightly connected to brain areas involved in defensive freezing responses ( Yim and Mogenson, 1989 80.

Our study provides extensive evidence that a BLA neuronal population can operate as a neuronal detector-effector circuit, able to integrate experience-dependent contextual information and mediate behavioral arrests.
Inputs into the BLA carrying spatial or spatial familiarity signals could potentially originate from the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex ( Fortin et al., 2004 27.

The hippocampus and perirhinal cortex could contribute to exploratory behavior, allowing animals to acquire information about novel surroundings based on self-motion ( Fortin et al., 2004 27.

BLA neurons may integrate inputs encoding spatial familiarity to guide behavior and even link spatial experience and the appropriate behavioral output via plasticity; for example, via spike-timing long-term potentiation ( Jung et al., 2010 37.

USA. 2010; 107 :4710-4715 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). The latter could explain why we observed a delayed location-specific arrest formation during probe test in day 6, after NL189 BLA neurons were inhibited for 5 days upon entrance to the area ( Figure S6 ). Our data demonstrating that long-term recruitment of an arrest-encoding BLA circuit originated in familiar locations where animals had arrested before suggest that recognition of spatial familiarity levels can be integrated and processed in the amygdala and used to guide a specific type of exploratory behavior: momentary arrests. These data could also provide a framework to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying the process of spatial latent learning, through which spatial learning occurs with no apparent reinforcers (e.g., food pellets) or associations (e.g., acoustic cues) ( Tolman, 1948 74. Tolman, E.C. The Psychological Review Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men Psychol. Rev. 1948; 55 :189-208 Crossref Scopus (4012) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although it has been found that stimulation of CEA-projecting BLA neurons induces appetitive and defensive behaviors ( Beyeler et al., 2016 3. Beyeler, A. ∙ Namburi, P. ∙ Glober, G.F. ... Divergent Routing of Positive and Negative Information from the Amygdala during Memory Retrieval Neuron. 2016; 90 :348-361 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2016 39. Kim, J. ∙ Pignatelli, M. ∙ Xu, S. ... Antagonistic negative and positive neurons of the basolateral amygdala Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19 :1636-1646 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ), we did not observe that manipulations of the NL189 BLA neuronal ensemble caused short- or long-term avoidance or preference behavior using two types of behavioral assays. This apparent discrepancy may be caused by the genetic background of the NL189 BLA neuronal population that differs from previous studies. Alternatively or in combination, our specific state-locked optogenetic manipulation differs from the common optogenetic stimulation adopted previously ( Beyeler et al., 2016 3. Beyeler, A. ∙ Namburi, P. ∙ Glober, G.F. ... Divergent Routing of Positive and Negative Information from the Amygdala during Memory Retrieval Neuron. 2016; 90 :348-361 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2017 40. Kim, J. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Muralidhar, S. ... Basolateral to Central Amygdala Neural Circuits for Article Basolateral to Central Amygdala Neural Circuits for Appetitive Behaviors Neuron. 2017; 93 :1464-1479.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, when silencing NL189 BLA neurons during a classical real-time place preference paradigm, we only observed an increase in speed with entrance to the ROI on rather than occurrence of short- or long-term avoidance or preference. Overall, these data suggest that NL189 BLA neurons are not involved in signaling spatial avoidance or preference in an exploratory state.
The implication of the amygdala in mediating experience-dependent behavioral arrests may seem improbable given the attention it has received in relation to positive/negative valence and anxiety/fear-related behaviors. However, previous independent studies demonstrate that pharmacological administration of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA; an NMDA receptor agonist) to the BLA triggers stopping behavior in a dose-dependent manner, whereas its lesioning decreases immobility ( Jellestad and Bakke, 1985 36. Jellestad, F.K. ∙ Bakke, H.K. Passive avoidance after ibotenic acid and radio frequency lesions in the rat amygdala Physiol. Behav. 1985; 34 :299-305 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yim and Mogenson, 1989 80. Yim, C.Y. ∙ Mogenson, G.J. Low doses of accumbens dopamine modulate amygdala suppression of spontaneous exploratory activity in rats Brain Res. 1989; 477 :202-210 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, the amygdala has been revealed to participate in execution of ongoing actions in humans ( Sagaspe et al., 2011 62. Sagaspe, P. ∙ Schwartz, S. ∙ Vuilleumier, P. Fear and stop: a role for the amygdala in motor inhibition by emotional signals Neuroimage. 2011; 55 :1825-1835 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). CEA-projecting NL189 BLA neurons were found to be active during spontaneous arrest but not during movement onset, and their efferents to the CEA (but not to the dorsal Str) are responsible for the decrease in movement speed and triggering behavioral arrests ( Figure 7 ; Figure S8 ). In addition, our data show that arrest-related NL189 BLA neurons projecting to the CEA only partially overlap with neurons active or inhibited during freezing. Our results and other groups have found that BLA principal neurons form direct excitatory projections onto a variety of CEA neurons ( Samson and Paré, 2005 63. Samson, R.D. ∙ Paré, D.

Midbrain circuits for defensive behaviour Nature. 2016; 534 :206-212 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S8 ). Fine-tuning of the direct BLA glutamatergic inputs onto defined CEA neurons could elicit arresting behavior via a feedforward inhibition to midbrain structures known to modulate movement, such as ventro-lateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG; Tovote et al., 2016 76. Tovote, P. ∙ Esposito, M.S. ∙ Botta, P. ... Midbrain circuits for defensive behaviour Nature. 2016; 534 :206-212 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) ( Roseberry et al., 2016 60. Roseberry, T.K. ∙ Lee, A.M. ∙ Lalive, A.L. ...

Our connectivity studies reveal that NL189 BLA neurons have a strong bias to contact MLR-projecting CEA neurons compared with those projecting to the vlPAG ( Figure S8 ). This raises the interesting hypothesis of a differential role of parallel circuits for distinct types of behavioral arrest targeted by different contextual inputs. For example, although the vlPAG would be recruited by CEA inputs involved in generation of strong defensive and learned freezing responses ( Tovote et al., 2016 76. Tovote, P. ∙ Esposito, M.S. ∙ Botta, P. ... Midbrain circuits for defensive behaviour Nature. 2016; 534 :206-212 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ), the connection between BLA and MLR-projecting CEA neurons could control momentary arrests during exploration, unrelated to fear ( Roseberry et al., 2019 61. Roseberry, T.K. ∙ Lalive, A.L. ∙ Margolin, B.D. ... Locomotor suppression by a monosynaptic amygdala to brainstem circuit bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Our imaging data show that a large proportion of BLA-CEA neurons active during momentary arrests do not correspond to those active during freezing. Therefore, our results suggest that the output circuits mediating momentary arrests and freezing are different because (1) the arrests are momentary and not prolonged ( Figure S5 ), (2) they occur spontaneously in familiar places and are not associated with negative valence ( Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ; Figures S5, S6 ), (3) they are associated with a change in heading and motion direction ( Figure S1 ), (4) activation of NL189 BLA neurons occurs at the onset of arresting but does not influence the duration of arrest ( Figures 3 H–3J), (5) even prolonged stimulation of NL189 BLA neurons fails to produce long-lasting immobility or freezing—they always lead to a momentary arrest of approximately the same duration ( Figure 2 N), and (6) a large neuronal population of NL189 BLA neurons projecting to the CEA was found to be active only during arrest and not active during freezing (not modulated or even inhibited during freezing; Figure 6 ; Figure S8 ).
On the other hand, it is clear that the contextual input to this circuit (i.e., the input to NL189 BLA neurons that makes them increase activity during an arrest in familiar places) is related to spatial experience and not to threatening situations. NL189 BLA neurons are not as active when animals arrest in areas they never visited before ( Figures 4 K–4O) or in areas to which they had been strongly habituated ( Figure S5 N). This activity seems to reflect a mechanism underlying detection of familiarity based on visual input. Furthermore, our data reveal that many of these neurons are not activated during the presentation of CSs that predict shocks and lead to freezing.
In summary, the data presented here suggest that a BLA-CEA axis acts as novelty/familiarity detector-effector circuitry for generating self-paced behavioral arrests based on the familiarity of a spatial location. They also reveal circuits mediating a latent learning strategy fundamental to performing efficient and safe exploration of novel surroundings by which animals move through space to acquire novel information at the interface between the familiar and the unknown.

All experimental protocols were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All experimental animals were 3 to 5 month-old male and female mice individually housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. BAC Transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of Arhgef6 (Tg(Arhgef6-cre)NL189Gsat/Mmucd, 034805-UCD) were used. The line has been backcrossed onto C57Bl6/J mice for at least 8 generations. Sample size is detailed in the Results or figure legends.
Surgeries were performed under sterile conditions and isoflurane (1%–5%, plus oxygen at 1-1.5 l/min) anesthesia on a motorized stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Model 900SD). Throughout each surgery, mouse body temperature was maintained at 37°C using an animal temperature controller (ATC2000, World Precision Instruments) and afterward, each mouse was allowed to recover from the anesthesia in its homecage on a heating pad. Before starting the surgery animals were subcutaneously injected with Buprenorphine SR (0.5 - 1 mg/Kg). The mouse head was shaved, cleaned with 70% alcohol and iodine, an intradermic injection of bupivacaine was administered and the skin on the skull was removed to allow for aligning of the head, drilling the hole for the injection site and performing the implantation. For the calcium imaging, each animal was unilaterally injected with 500 nL of AAV5-CAG-Flex-GCaMP6f-WPRE.SV40 (titer: 7x10 12 vg/mL; Addgene) into the left hemisphere of basolateral amygdala (AP: 1.2 mm, ML: 3.4 mm, DV: 4.2 mm) using a Nanojet III Injector (Drummond Scientific, USA) at a pulse rate of 2.6 nL per second, 9.9 nL per pulse every 5 s. To avoid the 500 nL of volume being delivered only in one location, potentially causing tissue damage, all basolateral amygdala injections were performed moving the tip of the pipette 50 μm deeper than the DV coordinate and injecting a volume of about 100nL every 10 μm. After each 10um, the pipette was slowly retracted until reaching the DV coordinate. The injection pipette was left in place for 10 min post-injection before it was slowly removed (rate 200 μm/s).
For calcium imaging combined with optogenetic inhibition, the virus AAV5-CAG-Flex-GCaMP6f-WPRE.SV40 was simultaneously injected with AAV-CAG-Flex-Jaws-KGC-tdTomato-ER2 (titer: 1.2x10 13 vg/mL; Addgene; ratio 1:1). For anatomical studies to assess CamKII and cre co-expression, each animal was unilaterally injected with 500nL rAAV2-CamKII-eYFP (titer: 4x10 12 vg/mL; UNC) and AAV1-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato (titer: 7.8x10 12 vg/mL; Addgene) as described above (ratio 1:1; 4x10 12 vg/mL;). For patch-clamp experiments to characterize the input-output curve, basolateral amygdala was bilaterally injected using AAV1-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato. For connectivity patch-clamp studies, BLA was injected with AAV1-EF1a-DIO-hChR2-YFP (titer: 2.3x10 13 vg/mL; Addgene) to express ChR. To target vlPAG-, MLR-projecting CEA neurons and Mc-projecting vlPAG neurons we used a retro AAV-CAG-TdTomato (titer: 1.01x10 13 vg/mL; Addgene) injected either vlPAG (AP: lamda, ML: 0.6 mm, DV: 2.35 mm), MLR (AP: 4.6 mm, ML: 1.2 mm, DV: 3.6 mm) or Mc (AP: 6.4 mm, ML: 0.95 mm, DV: 5.6 mm). For anatomical experiments in central amygdala, each animal was unilaterally injected (AP: 1.1 mm, ML: 2.5 mm, DV: 4.2 mm) into the left hemisphere using 100nL of a retro AAV virus AAV1-EF1a-DIO-YFP (titer: 3.5x10 12 vg/mL; Addgene) at a rate of 2.6nL per second, 4.6nL per pulse every 10 s. For optogenetic experiments, bilateral injections into basolateral amygdala were performed using 500nL conditional AAV viruses AAV1-EF1a-DIO-hChR2-YFP (titer: 2.3x10 13 vg/mL; Addgene; ChR group), AAV1-EF1a-DIO-YFP (titer: 3.5x10 12 vg/mL; Addgene; Control group), AAV-CAG-Flex-Jaws-KGC-tdTomato-ER2 (titer: 7.8x10 12 vg/mL; Jaws group), AAV1-CAG-Flex-tdTomato (titer: 5.9x10 13 vg/mL; Addgene; Control group). Using retrograde AAV viruses for the optogenetic experiments to specifically modulate the activity of central-projecting basolateral amygdala neurons, the bilateral injection in central amygdala of AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-HGHpA (titer: 1x10 13 vg/mL; Addgene; ChR group), AAV-EF1a-DIO-mCherry-WPRE-HGHpA (titer: 6.2x10 12 vg/mL; Addgene; Control group for ChR), pAAV-CAG-FLEX-Jaws-KGC-GFP-ER2 (titer: 1.3x10 13 vg/mL; Addgene; Jaws group), AAV pCAG-FLEX-mCherry-WPREv (titer: 6.2x10 12 vg/mL; Addgene; Jaws-Control group) were performed using the volume of 100nL as stated above. For imaging experiments of NL189 BLA-CEA, we injected a retrograde AAV-EF1a-DIO-GCaMP6f-P2A-nls-dTomato (titer: 8x10 12 vg/mL; Addgene 51083 - AAVrg; 200nl; Figures 6 A–6C) in CEA. For all the anatomical and patch-clamp experiments, after the injection, the skull was cleaned with saline and the skin sealed with Vetbond tissue adhesive (3M, USA) and stitches (MYCO Medical, USA).
Following the same surgical procedures, about two weeks after viral injection, a 500-nm-diameter gradient index (GRIN) lens (1050-002183, length ∼8.4, NA 0.5, pitch 2; Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was implanted in the left mouse amygdala above the injection site (AP: 1.2 mm, ML: 3.4 mm, DV: 4.2 mm). Once in place, the lens was secured to the skull using a combination of black Ortho-Jet powder and liquid acrylic resin site (Lang Dental, USA) as well as super glue (Loctite, LOC1255800). Care was taken to minimize scratches, moreover, the lens was covered with paper/tape to protect its surface. Three weeks after the GRIN lens implantation, the microendoscope baseplate (Inscopix) was mounted onto the head of the mouse under visual guidance using the attached microscope to determine the best field of view. The imaging field of view was inspected and allowed to clear for at least five days prior to imaging and behavioral experiments. For optical stimuli delivery, fiber optics (200 μm diameter, NA = 0.66) were implanted 200 um above the site of injection using super glue (Loctite, LOC1255800) and cement (as described above; Methods S1). For the NL189 BLA-CEA imaging, GRIN lenses of 0.6mm-diameter secured in BLA were placed using slightly different coordinates (AP: −1.50mm ; ML: −2.90 ∼-3.00mm (left side) ; DV: −4.20mm).
Mice were briefly anaesthetized using a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen and the mini-epifluorescence microscope was attached to the baseplate. A period of 20–30 min was allowed to recover in the home cage before experiments started. Fluorescence images were acquired at 20 Hz and the LED power was set at 10%–20% (0.1–0.2 mW) with a gain of 4 [excitation: blue light-emitting diode (LED); excitation filter: 475/10 nm, 0.24-0.6 mW/mm2; emission filter: 535/50 nm; Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA]. Image acquisition parameters were set to the same values between sessions to be able to compare the activity recorded. Seven GCaMP6f-expressing NL189-Cre mice were imaged during the emergence exploratory paradigm and fear test paradigm. The procedure and optical parameters were the same also for the nVoke mini-endoscope (Inscopix) with the only exception that the animal was head-fixed to perform the optogenetic inhibition in basolateral amygdala with Jaws delivering 120 pulses every 10 s of 630nm light.
The power from the optical fibers was 6-7 mW for the 465nm blue light for ChR and 3-4mW for the 630nm red light for Jaws. Before starting the series of behavioral experiments, optogenetic manipulation was tested using slice electrophysiology for ChR and Jaws as well in vivo for the case of Jaws. Regarding the Jaws experiments during exploration, we used 6 Jaws animals and 7 Control (3 out of 7 Control animals did not express the fluorophore). Regarding the experiments using the conditional AAV virus expressing ChR2 in BLA, all controls expressed the fluorophore YFP. Regarding the six Control animals in retro-ChR experiments, four expressed the fluorophore mCherry in BLA. All Control animals of retro-Jaws experiments expressed the fluorophore mCherry in BLA. All the experimental groups bilaterally expressed either Jaws or ChR ( Methods S1 ).
After completion of the behavioral experiments, mice were transcardially perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed for histological analysis and coronal slices were sectioned at 50 μm (Leica vibratome VT1000). For calcium imaging, immunohistochemistry was performed for GCaMP6 expression by incubating the sections with a GFP antibody (GFP Tag polyclonal antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, Molecular Probes #A-21311) diluted at 1:1000 in 0.4% Triton-PBS overnight at room temperature. DAPI was used as counterstaining for all the experiments.
Automated high-throughput imaging of tissue sections was performed on a custom-built automated slide scanner using a AZ100 microscope equipped with a 4x 0.4NA Plan Apo objective (Nikon Instruments Inc) and P200 slide loader (Prior Scientific), controlled by NIS-Elements using custom acquisition scripts (Nikon Instruments Inc.). This approach provided images with a lateral resolution of 1mm/pixel.
Images of tissue sections were processed and reconstructed in ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 65. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (38240) PubMed Google Scholar ) using BrainJ, a collection of custom tools developed to facilitate automated whole brain analysis of tissue sections in a manner similar to serial two photon tomography ( Kim et al., 2017 40. Kim, J. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Muralidhar, S. ... Basolateral to Central Amygdala Neural Circuits for Article Basolateral to Central Amygdala Neural Circuits for Appetitive Behaviors Neuron. 2017; 93 :1464-1479.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ) and light sheet microscopy ( Renier et al., 2016 56. Renier, N. ∙ Adams, E.L. ∙ Kirst, C. ... Mapping of Brain Activity by Automated Volume Analysis of Immediate Early Genes Cell. 2016; 165 :1789-1802 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multi-channel tissue section images are first arranged in an anterior to posterior order and processed to remove external fluorescence and neighboring objects and/or tissue sections. Subsequently, sections are centered and oriented to facilitate a 2D rigid body registration ( Thévenaz et al., 1998 71. Thévenaz, P. ∙ Ruttimann, U.E. ∙ Unser, M. A pyramid approach to subpixel registration based on intensity IEEE Trans. Image Process. 1998; 7 :27-41 Crossref Scopus (2212) PubMed Google Scholar ), which ultimately yields a 3D brain volume. In order to detect cell bodies and projections (axons/dendrites), a machine learning based pixel classification approach was employed using Ilastik ( Sommer et al., 2011 67. Sommer, C. ∙ Straehle, C.N. ∙ Köthe, U. ... Ilastik: Interactive learning and segmentation toolkit IEEE. 2011; 230-233 Google Scholar ) on images that had background subtracted via a rolling ball filter. Several images for each brain were pooled and used for training on cell bodies, projections, and background pixels. The resulting probability images were further processed in ImageJ for segmentation and analysis of cells and projections.
To analyze the resulting data within the context of the Allen Brain Atlas Common Coordinate Framework (CCF), 3D image registration was performed as previously described ( Ragan et al., 2012 54. Ragan, T. ∙ Kadiri, L.R. ∙ Venkataraju, K.U. ... Serial two-photon tomography for automated ex vivo mouse brain imaging Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :255-258 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Elastix ( Klein et al., 2010 42. Klein, S. ∙ Staring, M. ∙ Murphy, K. ... elastix: a toolbox for intensity-based medical image registration IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging. 2010; 29 :196-205 Crossref Scopus (3084) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this case, DAPI labeling of cell nuclei was used to register the brains to the reference brain using a 3D affine transformation with 4 resolution levels, followed by a 3D B-spline transformation with 3 resolution levels, using Mattes Mutual information to calculate similarity. Following registration, coordinates of detected cells, along with raw image data and segmented projection datasets were transformed into the CCF, allowing analysis of brain region based cell densities, measurements of intensity, and projection densities. Cell plots, density heatmaps, overlays of projections, brain region specific extraction, and subsequent outputs and visualizations were generated using BrainJ and Imaris (Oxford Instruments).

Standard procedures were used to prepare 300-μM-thick coronal slices from 12- to 20-week-old NL189 - cre and NL189 x Ai9 mice. Briefly, the brain was dissected in high-magnesium (10 mM) ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), mounted on a plate and sliced with a vibrating-blade microtome (V1200S, Leica, USA) at 4°C. Slices were maintained for 45 min at 37°C in an interface chamber containing ACSF equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2 and containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO 4 , 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 18 glucose, 0.79 ascorbate. After incubation, slices were left for at least 30 min at room temperature. Recordings were performed with ACSF in a recording chamber at a temperature of 35°C at a perfusion rate of 1–2 ml/min. Neurons were visually identified with infrared video microscopy using an upright microscope equipped with a 40 × objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Patch electrodes (3–5 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (G150F-3, Warner Instrument). For current clamp experiments, patch electrodes were filled with a solution containing the following (in mM): 123 potassium gluconate, 12 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP (pH adjusted to 7.25 with KOH, 295 mOsm). Optogenetic stimulations in slice were performed with a wavelength of 630 nm for Jaws or 465 nm for ChR2 using an optical fiber connected to a PlexBright LD-1 Single Channel LED Driver (Plexon, USA) or using the CoolLED system (pE-300 white ; CoolLED Ltd, UK), respectively. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were excluded if the access resistance exceeded 20 MΩ or changed more than 20% during the recordings. Seal resistance, for cell-attached recordings, was around 20 to 50 MΩ and data were excluded if it changed more that 20% from the initial value. Connectivity was assessed by stimulating the axons of BLA for 10ms at 100% power (∼35mW) with 465nm-light for 10ms. Recordings were in presence of TTX (1 μM) and 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 100 μM). oEPSCs were blocked by further bath-application of the AMPA-receptor antagonist, NBQX (10 μM). Successful connected neurons were defined to have oEPSCs > = 10pA with a success rate larger than 50% for all the stimulation trials. We used a conservative approach to avoid including false positives and ensure enough separation from baseline noise (about 2-5pA). As mentioned in the main text, we have included all the tested connections and found an overall significant difference in optogenetically evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (oEPSC) amplitude between NL189-BLA to vlPAG- and MLR-projecting CEA neurons ( Figure S8 ; p < 0.01 by unpaired t test). Data were recorded with a MultiClamp 700B (Molecular Devices) amplifier and digitized at 10 kHz with a digidata 1550A (Molecular Devices). Lowpass Filter of 0.2 kHz was applied for V-Clamp experiments. Data were acquired and analyzed with Clampex 10.0, Clampfit 10.0 (Molecular Devices) and in-house MATLAB codes. All chemicals for the internal and external solutions were purchased from Fluka/Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland). Glutamatergic blockers were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).
The dimensionality emergence assay consists of two opaque white cylindrical arenas of 20 cm and 100 cm of diameter with walls 30 cm of height. The opacity avoids reflection of light ensuring a better tracking of the animal without background contaminations. The arenas are interconnected with a 6 cm wide opening that can be closed with an automatic gate moving at 90 degrees. The setup is located inside a sound-attenuating box (2 × 2 x 2 m; skeleton in aluminum, Item 24; 25mm 75% Sound-Absorbing foam Sheet, McMaster; built in-house) that also confers the ability to control the general light intensity (∼6 Lux) without creating obvious shades inside the open field. The arenas were cleaned with 70% ethanol and an odor killer solution at the end of each session to remove olfactory cues. The locomotion of the animal was monitored with a camera (Grasshopper3, GS3-U3-41C6M, Flycapture) with wide-field objective (MVL8M1 - 8 mm EFL, f/1.4, for 1” C-Mount Format Cameras, THORLABS) mounted about 150cm above the two arenas. Spatial resolution was 1 cm per 5 pixels and temporal resolution was 30 frames per second. The animal’s center coordinates (centroid) were acquired online with the open source visual language BONSAI ( https://bonsai-rx.org/ ). The triggering of closed-loop optogenetic stimulation or inhibition was also performed with BONSAI via a standard Arduino MEGA 2560 board.
Mice were given four weeks to recover from surgery. Afterward they were handled for two consecutive days (five min each day) using a dummy endoscopic that mimics the weight of the miniscope or with optical patch cables to habituate them to the calcium imaging or optogenetic behavioral procedures, respectively.
Calcium imaging. For the calcium imaging experiments, the emergence assay exploratory procedure was performed in five days. On day 1, the animal was placed in the 20cm-arena for 30 minutes to promote familiarization (7 mice). Afterward, the automatic gate opened giving the animal the possibility to explore the 100cm-arena for 20 minutes. From day 2 to 5, the gate opened after ten minutes as familiarization to this area had already occurred on day 1.
Optogenetic manipulation. In the emergence assay, the location-specific optogenetic manipulation was made by setting one region of interest (ROI; 20 × 20 cm) in the 100cm-arena. The side of the ROI was counterbalanced between animals and selected to trigger the PlexBright optogenetic stimulation system LED module (Plexon, USA) to illuminate 465 nm blue light or 630 nm red light in basolateral amygdala. For the first five days (acquisition), the position of the ROI was maintained constant to ensure the acquisition of spatial memories. On day 6 (probe test), the entrance to the previous ROI on would not trigger the LED. Inhibition occurred for 2 s upon entrance to the ROI with a refractory time of 4 s in which the optogenetic LED could not be triggered. Regarding location-locked closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, it occurred using five 10ms pulses at 20 Hz followed by a refractory time of 4 s. In the speed- and acceleration-locked closed-loop experiments, optogenetic stimulation (20 Hz, 5 pulses of 10 ms; 250 ms length) or inhibition (2 s constant inhibition) triggered by animals’ acceleration was performed in the 100cm-arena. In the acceleration protocol, to make sure the animal was moving prior optogenetic stimulation, LEDs were triggered with a probability of about 33% only if the animal accelerated for at least 100 ms with a speed higher than 2 pixels per second (0.2 cm/s). The optogenetic manipulations were repeated for 50 trials. There was a refractory time of 20 s in between optogenetic light stimulation or inhibition. Control trials (trial off: ∼66%) were triggered by the acceleration but did not induce any light-emission.
Fear conditioning was elicited on day 1 (fear acquisition) in the fear conditioning chamber, a rectangular box with a metallic shock grid floor with the dimensions of 20 × 24 × 14 cm. After a period of 2min baseline, mice were exposed to ten 4kHz constant tones (30 s; ∼60dB; CS + ) co-terminating with 2 s footshock (0.7mA) with a random interval of 90 and 180 s. Sound of 4kHz was elicited with a sound buzzer WINGONEER 5PCS New Version Passive Buzzer Module for Arduino (about 60dB by iPhone app). Footshock was elicited using a generator MED associates Inc. (ENV-414S). On day 2, after performing calcium imaging in the exploration assay, we moved the mice to the fear test chamber (round and white open field: 38cm of diameter and 30cm of height). To assess fear learning, after a period of 2min baseline, mice were exposed to five CS + (no shock) with a random inter-tone interval between 90 and 180 s. Tones and footshocks were triggered with an arduino code written by Erica J. Rodriguez from Salzman lab at Columbia University. The two days of fear conditioning paradigm occurred after five days of exploration in the emergence assay combined with calcium imaging. The mini-edondoscope was still mounted between the exploration and fear test chambers to allow the tracking of the same neurons in two different paradigms. The fear chambers for the acquisition and test were placed in a sound-attenuated box that allowed as well the separation between experimenter and mouse. In order to create a unique olfactory context never experienced before, we placed a 50mL beaker inside the sound-attenuated box containing 1% acetic acid and 10% ethanol for the fear acquisition and test, respectively. We cleaned and removed escrements after each animal using 1% acetic acid and 10% ethanol for fear acquisition and test, respectively. The locomotion of the animal was monitored with a camera mounted above the fear acquisition and test chambers. Synchronization between animal’s movements and the onset and offset of the calcium imaging and tone was achieved with two LEDs, completely isolated from the animal’s view but visible with the camera mounted on top. Spatial resolution was 1 cm per 17.2105 pixels and temporal resolution was 30 frames per second.
We allowed animals to explore a rectangular open field (height: 24cm, length: 66cm) and perform an habituation, conditioning and test sessions in three consecutive days for 30min in each session. Only on day 2 (conditioning) the red LED was triggered upon entrance and stay of the mouse in one side area of the arena (28 × 24cm). We randomly counterbalanced the side of light inhibition to avoid innate preference for one side.
We targeted NL189 cre neurons ( NL189 BLA neurons) with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing tdTomato in a cre-dependent manner to quantify their location in BLA ( Figure 1 C; Videos S1 C and S1D). Anatomical analysis and automated quantification of cell populations reveal that NL189 BLA neurons are primarily located in the lateral-posterior part of the basal amygdala and ventral-lateral part of the lateral amygdala ( Figure 1 C; Figure S2 ; Video S1 D). Double injection of AAV viruses, one expressing tdTomato in a cre dependent manner and one expressing yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) in a CamKII-dependent manner, showed an overlap of ∼80% between NL189 BLA neurons and CamKII-expressing neurons ( Figures S2 H and S2I). Using a clustering analysis based on three parameters collected with the input-output function of NL189 BLA neurons (first inter-spike interval distribution, spike adaptation and maximum firing rate), we estimated that the majority are regular firing ( Figures S2 J–S2N). Together these results confirm the nature of NL189 BLA neurons as principal cells in BLA (pyramidal; Faber et al., 2001 23. Faber, E.S.L. ∙ Callister, R.J. ∙ Sah, P.

Using optogenetic stimulation in slice recordings, we tested the direct connectivity between BLA and the CEA neurons located in the medial subdivision (CEm) that project to the ventral-lateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG) (known to be involved in eliciting immobility; Ciocchi et al., 2010 10.

Tovote, P. ∙ Esposito, M.S. ∙ Botta, P. ... Midbrain circuits for defensive behaviour Nature. 2016; 534 :206-212 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S7 ). Confirming previous results assessed with electrical stimulation of BLA to CEA ( Samson and Paré, 2005 63. Samson, R.D. ∙ Paré, D. Activity-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity in the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :1847-1855 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that 54.5% of vlPAG-CEm neurons (12 out of 22) receive direct glutamatergic inputs from NL189 BLA neurons ( Figures S7 F–S7I). As recent studies show that the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), fundamental in locomotor initiation, is targeted by afferents from CEA ( Roseberry et al., 2016 60.

Midbrain circuits that set locomotor speed and gait selection Nature. 2018; 553 :455-460 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined whether MLR-projecting CEA neurons can receive glutamatergic inputs from NL189 BLA neurons using the same optogenetic approach to target vlPAG-projecting in slices. Not only did we find a direct glutamatergic connection from NL189 BLA neurons to MLR-projecting CEA neurons located in CEm, but also identified that this connection was significantly stronger than that of vlPAG-projecting CEA neurons ( Figures S7 F–S7I). We were able to elicit optogenetically-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs) onto MLR-projecting CEA neurons with a success rate of 100% (n = 22; Figure S7 F). To avoid any bias in our connectivity analysis (see STAR Methods ), we included all the tested connections and found an overall significant difference in oEPSC amplitude between NL189 BLA to vlPAG- and MLR-projecting CEA neurons ( Figure S7 G; p < 0.01 by unpaired t test). The oEPSCs amplitude recorded from this neuronal population was significantly higher than the oEPSCs recorded from vlPAG-projecting neurons ( Figure S7 G). We also tested whether NL189 BLA neurons could directly project to vlPAG, specifically to the neurons known to send their afferents to a pontine motor area (Medulla, Mc) important for freezing behavior ( Tovote et al., 2016 76. Tovote, P. ∙ Esposito, M.S. ∙ Botta, P. ... Midbrain circuits for defensive behaviour Nature. 2016; 534 :206-212 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). As no significant connections were found for all 28 neurons tested ( Figure S7 G), these results provide further evidence that there is no strong projection between BLA to vlPAG that could explain the arrests ( Tovote et al., 2016 76. Tovote, P. ∙ Esposito, M.S. ∙ Botta, P. ... Midbrain circuits for defensive behaviour Nature. 2016; 534 :206-212 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2016 79.

On the other hand, the excitatory efferents from BLA to different CEA neuronal populations were found to be quite robust and be likely candidates to participate in the triggering of arrests ( Figure S7 ; Roseberry et al., 2016 60.

We first tested the photocurrent elicited by light-activation of Jaws compared to eNpHR3.0 using whole-cell somatic patch-clamp recordings in slice (red-light, λ = 630nm; power max = 3.3mW; Figures 3 A and 3B; Figure S4 ). As we found that Jaws was much stronger in eliciting light-inducing hyperpolarizing photocurrent compared to eNpHR3.0 ( Figure S4 N), we used this inhibitory opsin to further screen its effect on neuronal excitability ( Figures 3 A–3C; Figure S4 ). The firing of NL189 BLA neurons elicited by a step-injection of somatic depolarizing current was completely inhibited by a 2 s red-light pulse and immediately restored after the light was switched off ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Additionally, inhibition caused a shift of the input-output function of NL189 BLA neurons toward more hyperpolarized values ( Figures S4 O–S4R). Jaws-induced NL189 BLA neurons inhibition rapidly and reliably blocked single action potentials elicited by 10ms-current step ( Figures S4 S and S4T). Furthermore, by co-injecting two conditional AAV viruses expressing Jaws and GCamp6f (1:1), we demonstrated the transient silencing of NL189 BLA neurons by combining optogenetic inhibition with in vivo calcium imaging of NL189 BLA neurons using the newly developed nVoke miniaturized microscope ( Owen et al., 2018 50. Owen, S.F. ∙ Berke, J.D. ∙ Kreitzer, A.C.

Segmentation of the smoothed path into progression segments and lingering episodes was done using the EM algorithm with a two-gaussians mixture model as described ( Golani et al., 1993 30. Golani, I. ∙ Benjamini, Y. ∙ Eilam, D. Stopping behavior: constraints on exploration in rats (Rattus norvegicus) Behav. Brain Res. 1993; 53 :21-33 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ; Drai et al., 2000 16. Drai, D. ∙ Benjamini, Y. ∙ Golani, I. Statistical discrimination of natural modes of motion in rat exploratory behavior J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 96 :119-131 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Drai and Golani, 2001 15. Drai, D. ∙ Golani, I. SEE: a tool for the visualization and analysis of rodent exploratory behavior Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2001; 25 :409-426 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we estimated the amount of motion within a temporal window of 500 ms and determined a threshold value under which a data point will be counted as arrest. We therefore computed the standard deviation (SD) of the distances between the data points and their mean using a sliding window of 0.5 s. This value was computed assuming the minimum amount of arrest that the animal can do ( Drai et al., 2000 16. Drai, D. ∙ Benjamini, Y. ∙ Golani, I. Statistical discrimination of natural modes of motion in rat exploratory behavior J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 96 :119-131 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). The arrests are found by studying the statistical distribution of SD and determining a threshold value. To estimate the distribution of the log max SD values of all the episodes in a session, a density estimator was used. Based on the notion that arrests segments are characterized by low SD and estimated background noise, we used the cut-off of three SDs to have a clear-cut between arrests and movement segments. Latency to arrest was the time of a maximum speed within 1 s before arrest onset relative to time of arrest onset (0 s). For the bulk imaging of BLA-Str neurons, we used one animal to average the calcium response at the onset of 256 arrests.
Segmentation of the smoothed path into progression segments and lingering episodes was done using exactly the same EM algorithm explained above ( Arrest detection section). We qualify freezing onset as the start of complete immobility occurring during the 30 s CS + .
We considered arrests occurring only in the 100cm-arena to study their formation in novel environments. For the mouse’s xy coordinates collected during calcium imaging studies, we combined the position of the animal across five days of exploration. Second, a spatial analysis was used to detect the first arrests occurring in specific region-of-interests (ROIs) of the big arena. Each first arrest was assigned to a defined round ROI (10 pixel radius, 2 cm radius). If arrests occurred within that radius range from the first arrests, they were counted as belonging to the same area. The script detected multiple spatially-segregated arrest areas that we could follow in time with the advantage that entrances, number of arrests and neuronal activity into these areas could be studied. If the entrances occurred less than 3 s apart, they were excluded to avoid a misleading overlap of neuronal activity from two consecutive visits. We excluded first arrests occurring less than 2cm from the border of an adjacent arrest area. Novel entrances were considered from the visit 1 to 5 while familiar entrances from 16 to 20. To calculate angles between past and future trajectories and the gate direction, the 5 most visited arrest areas of each day were analyzed. For each arrest inside those arrest areas the entry and exit direction of the animal’s trajectory was determined using the intersection of the trajectory with a circle of 2cm radius around the arrest position. Angles were calculated between entry and exit, and exit and gate direction for each trajectory. Angle histograms were normalized within animal and day and the normalized counts were averaged across animals and days to generate the polar histograms.
In order to tested whether momentary arrests in the small arena were associated with similar exploratory dynamics. We found that the arrest duration is slightly higher than in the large arena ( Figure S1 L). In addition, the number of arrests was initially low but increased within a couple of minutes after placing the animal for the first time in the small arena ( Figure S5 O). This strategy is similar to what was observed in the large arena, but the familiarization occurs much faster, as the space to explore is smaller (cumulative arrests in small versus big arena; Figure S5 P). We further analyzed the imaging data of NL189 BLA neurons in the small area in two phases: the first four (early phase; arrest 1-4) and the following four arrests (late phase; arrest 5-8) on the first day in the small arena ( Figures S5 Q–S5T). Similar to what was observed in the large arena, we found that the fraction of arrest neurons and their calcium transient magnitude increased from the early phase compared to the late phase ( Figures S5 Q–S5T). Similar to what was observed in the large arena, we found that the fraction of arrest neurons and their calcium transient magnitude increased from the early phase compared to the late phase ( Figures S5 I–S5T; see STAR Methods ).
Place preference was calculated either using the number of entrances or duration to the ROI on (20 × 20 cm square; LED switched on upon entrance during acquisition) versus the ROI off (20 × 20 cm square; located in the opposite site from the ROI on ; the LED was off upon entrance), using the following formula: (ROI on -ROI off ) (ROI on +ROI off ). The same formula was applied for assessing the place preference in the real-time place preference paradigm. To further clarify whether silencing of NL189 BLA neurons might cause spatial avoidance or preference, we performed the classical real-time place preference assay where these neurons where silenced when the animal entered a specific half of the chamber ( Figure S6 S). No place avoidance or preference were induced by silencing NL189 BLA neurons during the conditioning day, or in the subsequent test day (day 3; Figure S6 S).
All calcium movies were initially preprocessed in Mosaic (v.1.1.2, Inscopix) for spatial binning (4 × 4 pixels) and motion correction and subsequently analyzed using MATLAB. One-photon imaging is known to contain significant background signals arising from out-of-focal plane light and neuropil ( Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016 53.

The Spatiotemporal Organization of the Striatum Encodes Action Space Neuron. 2017; 95 :1171-1180.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) due to the fluorescence excitation of a relatively large three-dimensional volume compared to, for example, two-photon imaging. A constrained non-negative matrix factorization for endoscopic data (CNMF-E; Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016 53. Pnevmatikakis, E.A. ∙ Soudry, D. ∙ Gao, Y. ... Simultaneous Denoising, Deconvolution, and Demixing of Calcium Imaging Data Neuron. 2016; 89 :285-299 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ) was employed to correct somatic calcium transients. It allowed a superior estimation of calcium transients by eliminating the contaminated background fluorescence as a result of the modeling of spatial and temporal background statistics superimposed to the neuronal signals.
We calculated the speed of the animal using animal coordinates and converted for time (30Hz) and space resolution (1cm is 5pixels). ( ( x ⁢ ( t + 1 ) ⁢ − x ⁢ ( t ) ) 2 + ( y ⁢ ( t + 1 ) ⁢ − y ⁢ ( t ) ) 2 In order to understand the relationship between neuronal activity and speed, we computed the cross-correlation using the following MATLAB function as described ( Costa et al., 2006 13. Costa, R.M. ∙ Lin, S.-C. ∙ Sotnikova, T.D. ... Rapid alterations in corticostriatal ensemble coordination during acute dopamine-dependent motor dysfunction Neuron. 2006; 52 :359-369 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ) either using the mean neuronal activity from each animal or single cell: [ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐶 , 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑠 ] = 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑔 ) where CC is the cross-correlation of two discrete-time sequences, x and y; lag is a vector with the lags at which the correlations are computed; x is the normalized z-score of the neuronal activity from single neurons or from the entire population; y is the normalized z-score of the animal’s speed; maxlag represents the time-lag range from -maxlag to maxlag (20 s). The cross-correlation function was considered statistically significant when more than nine consecutive bins within the [-5 s, 5 s] interval lay outside the [minimum, maximum] bound of its values at intervals [26 s, 40 s] and [0 s, −14 s].
For the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) analysis, we used a method similar to the one described previously ( Cohen et al., 2012 12. Cohen, J.Y. ∙ Haesler, S. ∙ Vong, L. ... Neuron-type-specific signals for reward and punishment in the ventral tegmental area Nature. 2012; 482 :85-88 Crossref Scopus (899) PubMed Google Scholar ; da Silva et al., 2018 14. da Silva, J.A. ∙ Tecuapetla, F. ∙ Paixão, V. ... Dopamine neuron activity before action initiation gates and invigorates future movements Nature. 2018; 554 :244-248 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ). To produce the ROC curves, we compared the raw calcium activity average during the transition from movement to arrests of each 100-ms bin to the baseline calcium activity (–5 to –1 s before arrest) across trials. The auROC for each bin was calculated using trapezoidal numerical integration. In order to select arrest-responsive neurons, each auROC bin-values were compared to the baseline. Significance was established if at least three consecutive bin-values between the time range 1-2 s exceeded 1.5 SD (arrest active neurons) or were less than −1.5 SD (arrest inhibited neurons) from baseline average. After the selection of neurons using two methods, auROC and cross-correlation analysis, neurons active during arrest and anti-CC with speed were considered the “pure” arrest neurons, or significant neurons, and used the spatial analysis of arrest areas. Neuronal activity of neurons active during arrest and anti-CC with speed was averaged for each animal and the peak response (difference between the peak between 5 to 7 s and baseline range, –5 to –1 s) was tested during entrance to the novel and familiar areas. Latency to calcium activity onset was the time of a significant peak calcium response relative to time of arrest onset (0 s).
Together with the auROC analysis, we used a z-score sorting analysis to understand which neurons were active during arrest and freezing bouts onset. To calculate z-score values, we compared the raw calcium activity average during the transition from movement to arrests, or to freezing, to the baseline calcium activity (–5 to –1 s before arrest) across trials. Significance was established if at least three consecutive values between the time range 1-2 s exceeded 2.567 SD (arrest active neurons) or were less than −2.567 SD (arrest inhibited neurons) from baseline average.
Mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) was used to report statistics if not indicated otherwise. For all within-subject quantifications, we calculated the average across all 5 recording sessions. Statistical tests used and the sample size for each analysis is listed in the Results or figure legends. Both parametric and non-parametric tests were used wherever appropriate. Hypothesis testing was done at a significance level of p = 0.05. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. All analyses were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks) while the graphs and statistical tests with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad software, USA). Experimental data were excluded based on imaging quality due to movement artifact, a lack of cells, a bad focal plane, lack of viral infection in the targeted areas and misplacement of the optical fibers.
