Title: Virome characterization of game animals in China reveals a spectrum of emerging pathogens


Abstract: Summary

Game animals are wildlife species traded and consumed as food and are potential reservoirs for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We performed a meta-transcriptomic analysis of 1,941 game animals, representing 18 species and five mammalian orders, sampled across China. From this, we identified 102 mammalian-infecting viruses, with 65 described for the first time. Twenty-one viruses were considered as potentially high risk to humans and domestic animals. Civets ( Paguma larvata ) carried the highest number of potentially high-risk viruses. We inferred the transmission of bat-associated coronavirus from bats to civets, as well as cross-species jumps of coronaviruses from bats to hedgehogs, from birds to porcupines, and from dogs to raccoon dogs. Of note, we identified avian Influenza A virus H9N2 in civets and Asian badgers, with the latter displaying respiratory symptoms, as well as cases of likely human-to-wildlife virus transmission. These data highlight the importance of game animals as potential drivers of disease emergence.

Section: Introduction

Mammalian game animals are wild or semi-wild animals that are commonly traded and consumed as exotic food in China and other Asian countries ( Huong et al., 2020 34.

They include rodents (such as porcupines, bamboo rats, and marmots), carnivores (such as civets, raccoon dogs, badgers, and foxes), pangolins, hedgehogs, and rabbits. These animals are normally either caught and raised locally or imported illegally from neighboring countries before being transferred to live animal (or “wet”) markets for trading ( Aditya et al., 2021 2.

Xiao, X. ∙ Newman, C. ∙ Buesching, C.D. ... Animal sales from Wuhan wet markets immediately prior to the COVID-19 pandemic Sci. Rep. 2021; 11 :11898 Google Scholar ). In recent decades, there has been a major expansion in commercial wildlife farming operations and their species diversity. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, to which many of the early COVID-19 cases were linked ( Sun et al., 2020a 73. Sun, J. ∙ He, W.-T. ∙ Wang, L. ... COVID-19: epidemiology, evolution, and cross-disciplinary perspectives Trends Mol. Med. 2020; 26 :483-495 Google Scholar ; Worobey, 2021 83. Worobey, M. Dissecting the early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan Science. 2021; 374 :1202-1204 Google Scholar ), is a notable example of a live animal market. Poor hygiene conditions and close contact between animals and humans, as well as a wide mix of species within live animal markets and the restaurants they serve, make them an ideal breeding ground for emerging infectious diseases.
Unsurprisingly, consuming, capturing, processing, and/or trading game animals has been linked to several infectious disease outbreaks with grave public health consequences. Early cases of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were identified in animal handlers at animal markets in Guangdong ( Skowronski et al., 2005 70. Skowronski, D.M. ∙ Astell, C. ∙ Brunham, R.C. ... Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a year in review Annu. Rev. Med. 2005; 56 :357-381 Google Scholar ) and Hubei provinces ( Sun et al., 2020a 73. Sun, J. ∙ He, W.-T. ∙ Wang, L. ... COVID-19: epidemiology, evolution, and cross-disciplinary perspectives Trends Mol. Med. 2020; 26 :483-495 Google Scholar ), respectively, and close relatives of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in civets ( Guan et al., 2003 28. Guan, Y. ∙ Zheng, B.J. ∙ He, Y.Q. ... Isolation and characterization of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in southern China Science. 2003; 302 :276-278 Google Scholar ), raccoon dogs ( Guan et al., 2003 28. Guan, Y. ∙ Zheng, B.J. ∙ He, Y.Q. ... Isolation and characterization of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in southern China Science. 2003; 302 :276-278 Google Scholar ), and pangolins ( Lam et al., 2020 40. Lam, T.T.-Y. ∙ Jia, N. ∙ Zhang, Y.-W. ... Identifying SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins Nature. 2020; 583 :282-285 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2020 89. Zhang, T. ∙ Wu, Q. ∙ Zhang, Z. Probable pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 associated with the COVID-19 outbreak Curr. Biol. 2020; 30 :1346-1351.e2 Google Scholar ). These are the most popular exotic game animals and subject to frequent trading and human consumption ( Chen et al., 2008 17. Chen, J.P. ∙ Andersen, D.H. ∙ Veron, G. ... Isolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers for the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) Biochem. Genet. 2008; 46 :392-397 Google Scholar ), although their role as direct hosts for the transmission of these viruses to humans is often uncertain. In an analogous manner, multiple lineages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), likely originated from the hunting or handling of primate carcasses in central and central-west Africa ( Aghokeng et al., 2010 3. Aghokeng, A.F. ∙ Ayouba, A. ∙ Mpoudi-Ngole, E. ...

Cross-species transmission of simian retroviruses: how and why they could lead to the emergence of new diseases in the human population AIDS. 2012; 26 :659-673 Google Scholar ).
As game animals are frequently associated with important human diseases, it is of obvious importance to identify existing or potential pathogens within these species so that they can be used to trace the origins of specific epidemics and provide a risk assessment of the most likely sources of future outbreaks. Since the first SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002/2003, virus discovery studies have been performed in a variety of game animal species including civets, pangolins, marmots, and badgers. Initially, these studies utilized virus isolation, consensus PCR, and Sanger sequencing ( Banks et al., 2002 7. Banks, M. ∙ King, D.P. ∙ Daniells, C. ...

In addition to SARS-like viruses, these studies have identified several infectious agents that are of direct importance for human infection, such as Rotavirus A from civets and raccoon dogs ( Abe et al., 2010 1.

Arnaboldi, S. ∙ Righi, F. ∙ Carta, V. ... Hepatitis E virus (HEV) spread and genetic diversity in game animals in Northern Italy Food Environ. Virol. 2021; 13 :146-153 Google Scholar ). Both of these viruses are known to infect humans as well as a wide range of mammalian hosts ( Dóró et al., 2015 23. Dóró, R. ∙ Farkas, S.L. ∙ Martella, V. ... Zoonotic transmission of rotavirus: surveillance and control Expert Rev. Anti Infect. Ther. 2015; 13 :1337-1350 Google Scholar ; Nimgaonkar et al., 2018 57.

Pavio, N. ∙ Meng, X.J. ∙ Doceul, V. Zoonotic origin of hepatitis E. Curr. Opin. Virol. 2015; 10 :34-41 Google Scholar ). Despite this, there have been few systematic investigations of the virome in game animals, especially in China where their consumption is commonplace. For example, one study identified a virus commonly associated with pneumonia in rodents— Murine respirovirus —and in pangolins, suggesting the epizootic potential of viruses in game animals ( Liu et al., 2019 49. Liu, P. ∙ Chen, W. ∙ Chen, J.P. Viral metagenomics revealed Sendai virus and coronavirus infection of Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) Viruses. 2019; 11 :979 Google Scholar ).
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, China has been the focus of widespread viral surveillance in wildlife animals, and a number of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses have been discovered in bats ( Zhou et al., 2020 91. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.-L. ∙ Wang, X.-G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Google Scholar , 2021 90. Zhou, H. ∙ Ji, J. ∙ Chen, X. ... Identification of novel bat coronaviruses sheds light on the evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses Cell. 2021; 184 :4380-4391.e14 Google Scholar ). However, with the exception of pangolins, there has been little investigation of game animals, even though they have close contact with humans and domestic animals and, hence, provide a link to other wildlife species. To help fill this gap, we performed a systematic meta-transcriptomic (i.e., total RNA sequencing) investigation of the viromes of 18 species of game animals representing five mammalian orders collected across China. Many of the species were investigated for the first time within a metagenomic framework. Our goal was to reveal the diversity and abundance of vertebrate-associated viruses in these game animals and assess which species have the greatest potential to carry viruses that could eventually emerge in human populations.

Section: Results

Between 2017 and 2021, we performed a large-scale survey of viral pathogens in game animals commonly consumed as exotic food in China ( Figure 1 A). The majority of our animal samples (99.07% [1,923/1,941]) were collected after February 2020 and concurrent with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Only a subset of the pangolin samples (n = 11) and Malayan porcupine samples (n = 7) was collected between 2017 and 2019.
The complete sample collection comprised 1,941 animals from 18 species representing five mammalian orders: Rodentia, Pholidota, Carnivora, Eulipotyphla, and Lagomorpha ( Figure 1 B). Many of these species were shown on the game animal price list at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, including civets ( P. larvata ) that have been implicated in the emergence of SARS-CoV ( Wu et al., 2005 84. Wu, D. ∙ Tu, C. ∙ Xin, C. ... Civets are equally susceptible to experimental infection by two different severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolates J. Virol. 2005; 79 :2620-2625 Google Scholar ). Although most of these animals were maintained in artificial breeding sites that supply animal markets and zoos ( Figure 1 D, upper panel), some were obtained from their natural habitats. In addition, some animals had obvious signs of infectious diseases and some even died during collection ( Figure 1 D, middle panel), presenting with symptoms such as paralysis in porcupines, anorexia and convulsion in pangolins, flu-like symptoms (nasal excretions) in Himalayan marmots, and runny nose in raccoon dogs ( Figure 1 C). Other animals exhibited no overt signs of diseases. Respiratory and fecal samples were collected from these animals across 20 provinces in China ( Figure 1 D, bottom panel), subsequently organized into 239 pools according to species, location, health, and living conditions ( Table S1 ) for meta-transcriptomic sequencing. This process yielded 3,150.84 billion nucleotide bases of sequence reads for virus discovery and characterization.
Despite the very large number of viruses discovered, we focused on those associated with vertebrates, comprising: (1) vertebrate-specific viruses that exhibited relatively close phylogenetic relationships to virus families or genera already known to infect vertebrates and (2) vector-borne viruses previously associated with both vertebrates and arthropods. Other viruses likely associated with non-vertebrate hosts derived from animal diet, co-infecting parasites, or endosymbionts were not considered further.
A total of 102 vertebrate-associated viral species from 13 viral families were identified based on meta-transcriptomic sequencing and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing ( Figure 2 A; Table S2 ). This comprised 16 species of DNA virus belonging to the genera Dependoparvovirus , Bocaparvovirus , Protoparvovirus , Amdoparvovirus , and Chapparvovirus from the family Parvoviridae and 86 RNA virus species belonging to the genera/families Picornaviridae , Astroviridae , Paramyxoviridae , Orthomyxoviridae , Orthopneumoviruis , Flaviviridae , Reoviridae , Coronaviridae , Caliciviridae , Tobaniviridae , Hepeviridae , and Birnaviridae ( Figure 2 B). Among these, viruses of the Picornaviridae , Astroviridae , and Parvovirdae were the most commonly detected and showed relatively high abundance and prevalence in many animal species, whereas other viral families were more sporadically detected ( Figure 2 C). For example, coronaviruses were identified in bamboo rats, civets, raccoon dogs, and hedgehogs; influenza viruses were identified in civets, Asian badgers, and bamboo rats; caliciviruses were identified in bamboo rats, rabbits, civets, and Asian badgers; and the genera Orthorubulavirus ( Paramyxoviridae ) and Pestivirus ( Flaviviridae ) were mainly identified in pangolins ( Figure 2 C). No viruses closely related to either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 (or other sarbecoviruses) were detected in any of the animals examined.
Phylogenetic analyses of the viruses identified here revealed that many had close evolutionary relationships (>80% nucleotide sequence identity) to viruses known to cause diseases in other wildlife species, domestic animals, or even humans, thereby greatly expanding their host range ( Figures 3 , 4 , and S1 ). In particular, viruses associated with human infection, namely Influenza A virus (subtype H9N2), Influenza B virus , Norwalk virus , Orthohepevirus A , Human parainfluenza virus 2 (HPIV2), Rotavirus A and C , and Mammalian orthoreovirus , were identified in some game animals for the first time.
Evolutionary analyses of the newly identified H9N2 viruses based on the HA and NA segments revealed that the sequences obtained here comprised two clusters, both belonging to the BJ94-like lineage that is the major epizootic strain in China; this lineage is of poultry origin and has been recently associated with a number of human cases ( Bi et al., 2020 9. Bi, Y. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Li, S. ... Dominant subtype switch in avian influenza viruses during 2016–2019 in China Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5909 Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 and S2 ). Additional analyses based on surface and internal gene sets revealed that the viruses identified in this study possessed the 155T, 183N, and 226L amino substitutions in the HA1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the I292V substitution (in the civet virus only) in the PB2 protein that have been associated with human infection or adaptation to human cell lines ( Gao et al., 2019 26. Gao, W. ∙ Zu, Z. ∙ Liu, J. ... Prevailing I292V PB2 mutation in avian influenza H9N2 virus increases viral polymerase function and attenuates IFN-β induction in human cells J. Gen.

Sun, X. ∙ Belser, J.A. ∙ Maines, T.R. Adaptation of H9N2 influenza viruses to mammalian hosts: a review of molecular markers Viruses. 2020; 12 :541 Google Scholar ). Similarly, amino acid substitutions, such as 368V in PB1, and 356R, 100A, and 409N in the PA gene, have been associated with the infection of mammalian hosts ( Chen et al., 2006 16.

Virol. 2016; 90 :8105-8114 Google Scholar ) ( Table S3 ).
In contrast, HPIV2, Norwalk virus and Influenza B virus , previously thought to be human-specific, were detected in pangolins, civets, and bamboo rats, respectively, and at moderate or high abundance (29.64–293,198.54 reads per million total reads [RPM]). Furthermore, we identified four canine coronaviruses (CCoV, species alphacoronavirus 1, or AlphaCoV1) in raccoon dogs suffering from diarrhea. Notably, these viruses shared 93.65%–94.27% genome identity with a recombinant CCoV strain—CCoV-HuPn-2018—recently reported to cause diseases in humans ( Lednicky et al., 2021a 43. Lednicky, J.A. ∙ Tagliamonte, M.S. ∙ White, S.K. ... Isolation of a novel recombinant canine coronavirus from a visitor to Haiti: further evidence of transmission of coronaviruses of zoonotic origin to humans Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; 28 :ciab924 Google Scholar ; Vlasova et al., 2022 79. Vlasova, A.N. ∙ Diaz, A. ∙ Damtie, D. ... Novel canine coronavirus isolated from a hospitalized pneumonia patient, East Malaysia Clin. Infect. Dis. 2022; 74 :446-454 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 ). The four new raccoon dog CCoV genomes also exhibited a complex recombination history, involving a divergent S2 protein ( Figure S3 ). Specifically, although phylogenetic analysis of a breakpoint-free segment in ORF1AB suggested a relatively close, paraphyletic relationship with the genotype 2 subtype a CCoV from Chinese dogs sampled in 2019 ( Figure S3 C), the raccoon dog CCoVs form a distinct monophyletic lineage in a breakpoint-free S segment (i.e., S2). These novel raccoon dog CCoV genomes, therefore, represent a previously unsampled lineage of canine coronaviruses.
Our results similarly suggested cross-species transmission among animal viruses ( Figure S1 ). Bat-associated coronavirus HKU8 was identified in a civet (98.66% amino acid sequence identity in the RdRp protein, Figure S4 ); avian-associated coronavirus HKU17 was identified in porcupines (in both oral and fecal swabs, 94.27% identity); dog-associated canine coronavirus was identified in raccoon dogs (97.05% identity; see above); mouse-associated Murine orthopneumovirus was identified in pangolins (98.56% identity); bovine-associated Bovine respirovirus 3 was identified in a rodent species—coypu (98.91% identity); and multiple Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 lineages were identified in both Malayan and Chinese pangolins (96.60%–99.89% identity). Interestingly, our data also suggested that Mangshi virus (genus Seadornavirus and Reoviridae ), a mosquito-borne virus of unknown vertebrate host but with the capacity to replicate in vertebrate cell lines (i.e., a vector-borne virus) ( Wang et al., 2015 80. Wang, J. ∙ Li, H. ∙ He, Y. ... Isolation and genetic characterization of Mangshi virus: a newly discovered Seadornavirus of the Reoviridae family found in Yunnan Province, China PLoS One. 2015; 10 :e0143601 Google Scholar ), was present in both porcupine and civet samples. The remaining viruses identified, such as Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), Aichivirus A , Rodent coronavirus ( Embecovirus ), and Carnivore amdoparvovirus 3 , were more reflective of their known host range.
In addition to the existing viral species, we identified 65 previously undescribed putative viral species of vertebrates, the majority of which belonged to the Picornaviridae (n = 21), Astroviridae (n = 17), Flavivirdae (n = 8), and Parvoviridae (n = 10), with others belonging to the Reoviridae ( Coypu rotavirus , Coypu rotavirus B , and Civet rotavirus D ), Tobaniviridae ( Porcupine nidovirus ), and Caliciviridae ( Asian badger vesivirus and Bamboo rat sapovirus ) ( Figure 3 ). Interestingly, some of the newly discovered viruses or virus groups, including Mammalian enterovirus , civet and coypu kobuviruses , porcupine and coypu astroviruses, Porcupine pegivirus , Pangolin pestivirus , Bamboo rat sapovirus , and Hedgehog chapparvovirus , had both high prevalence and abundance in their respective host species ( Figure 2 ) and sometimes formed species-specific clusters ( Figure 3 ). However, their disease manifestation and potential threat to humans is unclear.
We also characterized the virome of sick and/or deceased animals, often using mixed tissue samples. For individual animals with a clear record of clinical symptoms, the majority (9/21) were infected with at least one virus species, whereas others (7/21) carried two or more viruses ( Figure 5 A). Influenza A virus H9N2 was detected in both pools samples from Asian badgers presenting with respiratory symptoms; different combinations of Pangolin hunnivirus , Human orthorubulavirus 2 , Murine orthopneumovirus , and a diverse group of pangolin pestiviruses were detected in individual samples of Malayan pangolins suffering from gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and multiple organ hemorrhage; Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 and Norwalk virus were simultaneously detected in a pooled fecal sample obtained from a civet population experiencing diarrheal symptoms; different combinations of enteric viruses, including astroviruses, rotaviruses, and AlphaCoV 1, were detected in raccoon dog populations with diarrhea symptoms; and a novel pegivirus ( Porcupine pegivirus ) was detected in individual samples and eight Malayan porcupines pools, of which four presented with depressive-like behavior, paralysis, and trichomadesis symptoms. Conversely, no viral pathogens were detected in some deceased animals that had no recorded clinical symptoms and, hence, an unknown cause of death, including masked civets (n = 5), hedgehogs (n = 4), raccoon dogs (n = 3), and coypus (n = 2) ( Figure 5 A). In addition to those in deceased animals, a variety of pathogens were detected in seemingly healthy animals ( Figure 5 B). For example, Influenza A virus H9N2 was identified in a healthy civet, although the same virus may be the cause of the influenza-like symptoms in the Asian badgers studied here. Similarly, Orthohepevirus A , Mangshi virus , and Mammalian orthorubulavirus 5 were detected in healthy civets, and a common human pathogen, Influenza B virus , was identified in a seemingly healthy bamboo rat population ( Figure 5 B).
Among the 102 vertebrate-associated viruses identified here, we characterized the epidemiological patterns of 21 that we considered to pose a greater risk for infection of humans or other animal species. This risk assessment was simply based on perceived zoonotic potential (i.e., likely ability to infect humans) and/or tendency to jump species barriers and infect other animal hosts ( Figure 6 A). Most of these putative high-risk viruses exhibited a strong geographic structure, clustering according to Chinese province. For example, Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 was found in Hunan province, Bovine respirovirus 3 was found in Hebei province, and Influenza B virus was found in Zhejiang province, whereas Mammalian orthorubulavirus 5 was found in Yunnan province ( Figure 6 B). In contrast, several viruses had a wider geographical range. For example, Influenza A virus H9N2 was identified in Hebei province (northern China) and Zhejiang province (eastern China), Alphacoronavirus 1 was identified in Shandong (eastern China), Hebei (central China), and Guangxi provinces (southern China), whereas Rotavirus A was identified in Shandong (eastern China), Jiangxi (eastern China), Hubei (central China), and Guangxi provinces (southern China), and others ( Figure 6 B). Several viruses exhibited high prevalence as well as signatures of cross-species transmission, appearing in multiple libraries within the same or different species. For example, Rotavirus A was detected in four animal species ( Figure 6 C), whereas Mangshi virus was discovered in both porcupines and civets, although human infection has not yet been identified.
Finally, we compared the likelihood of different game animals carrying pathogens of greater potential zoonotic risk and the presence of these pathogens among different species ( Figure 6 D). Among the animals studied, civets had the highest number of potentially high-risk viruses (n = 7), followed by porcupines (n = 4), coypus (n = 3), bamboo rats (n = 3), raccoon dogs (n = 3), and Malayan pangolins (n = 3), although sample sizes vary. Hence, there is a risk of cross-species transmission to other groups of game animals, and it is notable that Malayan and Chinese pangolins were not surveyed for viruses until very recently.

Section: Discussion

We performed a large-scale survey of game animals that are commonly consumed for food or medical use in China, among which many species were examined for the first time, and some have been banned by the Chinese Government for trading or artificial breeding since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis identified a wide diversity of both previously described and novel virus species, some of which may pose a direct threat to human health. Notably, we did not identify any SARS-CoV-2-like or SARS-CoV-like sequences in our samples, including in Malayan pangolins from which SARS-CoV-2-like viruses have previously been reported ( Lam et al., 2020 40. Lam, T.T.-Y. ∙ Jia, N. ∙ Zhang, Y.-W. ... Identifying SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins Nature. 2020; 583 :282-285 Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2019 49. Liu, P. ∙ Chen, W. ∙ Chen, J.P. Viral metagenomics revealed Sendai virus and coronavirus infection of Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) Viruses. 2019; 11 :979 Google Scholar ). However, although some frequently traded animals were included in this study, such as civets, raccoon dogs, and pangolins, the sample size and diversity of game animals analyzed were relatively small considering the total number consumed in China and Southeast Asia, and we did not analyze internationally smuggled animals. The ongoing surveillance of game animals in wildlife trading hotspots worldwide clearly remains of utmost importance in understanding the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Although no SARS-like viruses were identified, we did detect a potential cross-species transmission event involving a bat-associated coronavirus. Specifically, we identified a bat-associated virus—Miniopterus BatCoV-HKU8—in a civet that represents a different mammalian order (Carnivora). Genomic comparisons revealed a high sequence identity across most of the virus genome (>93.84% amino acid identity) with the exception of the N-terminal proportion of the S1 subunit of the spike protein (36.52%–81.74% amino acid identity) that contained the RBD. In addition, potential bat-to-hedgehog ( Erinaceus amurensis hedgehog coronavirus HKU31, Ea-HedCoV HKU31) spillovers or host switches were identified. Specifically, viruses identified from the hedgehog clustered within the MERS-like virus group ( Figure 3 ) previously identified in Amur hedgehogs and European hedgehogs ( Figure S1 ) ( Corman et al., 2014 19. Corman, V.M. ∙ Kallies, R. ∙ Philipps, H. ... Characterization of a novel Betacoronavirus related to middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in European hedgehogs J. Virol. 2014; 88 :717-724 Google Scholar ; Lau et al., 2019 42. Lau, S.K.P. ∙ Luk, H.K.H. ∙ Wong, A.C.P. ... Identification of a novel Betacoronavirus (Merbecovirus) in Amur hedgehogs from China Viruses. 2019; 11 :980 Google Scholar ), suggesting that hedgehogs are likely important reservoirs for MERS-like viruses. Collectively, we suggest that cross-species transmission from bats to game animals may represent a possible pathway for the virus to move from bats to humans. Indeed, bat-associated alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are the ancestors for those viruses that cause disease outbreaks in humans, including SARS-CoV ( Rota et al., 2003 64.

A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Google Scholar ), MERS-CoV ( Assiri et al., 2013 6. Assiri, A. ∙ McGeer, A. ∙ Perl, T.M. ...

Wildlife in Cameroon harbor diverse coronaviruses including many isolates closely related to human coronavirus 229E Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ), and HCoV-NL63 ( van der Hoek et al., 2006 77. van der Hoek, L. ∙ Pyrc, K. ∙ Berkhout, B. Human coronavirus NL63, a new respiratory virus FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30 :760-773 Google Scholar ), although they commonly pass through the so-called “intermediate” hosts such as civets and raccoon dogs for SARS-CoVs ( Guan et al., 2003 28. Guan, Y. ∙ Zheng, B.J. ∙ He, Y.Q. ... Isolation and characterization of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in southern China Science. 2003; 302 :276-278 Google Scholar ), camels for MERS-CoVs ( Dudas et al., 2018 24. Dudas, G. ∙ Carvalho, L.M. ∙ Rambaut, A. ... MERS-CoV spillover at the camel-human interface Elife. 2018; 7 , e31257 Google Scholar ), and alpacas for HCoV-229E ( Crossley et al., 2012 20. Crossley, B.M. ∙ Mock, R.E. ∙ Callison, S.A. ... Identification and characterization of a novel alpaca respiratory coronavirus most closely related to the human coronavirus 229E Viruses. 2012; 4 :3689-3700 Google Scholar ).
In addition to bat-associated viruses, coronaviruses associated with other mammalian species have also impacted human populations, including canine coronaviruses associated with infection of patients from Malaysia ( Vlasova et al., 2022 79. Vlasova, A.N. ∙ Diaz, A. ∙ Damtie, D. ... Novel canine coronavirus isolated from a hospitalized pneumonia patient, East Malaysia Clin. Infect. Dis. 2022; 74 :446-454 Google Scholar ) and Haiti ( Lednicky et al., 2021a 43. Lednicky, J.A. ∙ Tagliamonte, M.S. ∙ White, S.K. ... Isolation of a novel recombinant canine coronavirus from a visitor to Haiti: further evidence of transmission of coronaviruses of zoonotic origin to humans Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; 28 :ciab924 Google Scholar ) who suffered from febrile or lower respiratory tract symptoms, as well as porcine deltacoronaviruses in three Haitian children with acute undifferentiated febrile illness ( Lednicky et al., 2021b 44. Lednicky, J.A. ∙ Tagliamonte, M.S. ∙ White, S.K. ... Independent infections of porcine Deltacoronavirus among Haitian children Nature. 2021; 600 :133-137 Google Scholar ). Strikingly, related viruses were also identified in game animals (i.e., civets, raccoon dogs, and porcupines), exhibiting 94% and 85% nucleotide identity with the respective human CCoV strain and porcine deltacoronaviruses, respectively. This further supports the notion that these viruses can acquire expansive host ranges over relatively short evolutionary timescales. Our study, therefore, highlights the fact that coronaviruses are subject to relatively frequent host jumps among mammalian species and, therefore, may pose a direct threat to wildlife animal handlers or during food consumption.
Another virus that might pose an immediate threat to human health is avian influenza virus H9N2 that has increased in prevalence in live poultry markets workers in China ( Li et al., 2017 47. Li, X. ∙ Tian, B. ∙ Jianfang, Z. ... A comprehensive retrospective study of the seroprevalence of H9N2 avian influenza viruses in occupationally exposed populations in China PLoS One. 2017; 12 :e0178328 Google Scholar ). H9N2 has gradually replaced H5N6 and H7N9 as the most prevalent AIV subtype in both chickens and ducks ( Bi et al., 2020 9. Bi, Y. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Li, S. ... Dominant subtype switch in avian influenza viruses during 2016–2019 in China Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5909 Google Scholar ) and has caused numerous human infections in China. Indeed, in comparison with other currently circulating avian influenza viruses, H9N2 has clear potential to infect humans because almost all subtype H9 AIVs possess human-type receptor-binding ability ( Bi et al., 2016 8. Bi, Y. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Wang, Q. ... Genesis, evolution and prevalence of H5N6 avian influenza viruses in China Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :810-821 Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2014 48. Liu, D. ∙ Shi, W. ∙ Gao, G.F. Poultry carrying H9N2 act as incubators for novel human avian influenza viruses Lancet. 2014; 383 :869 Google Scholar ). The viruses discovered in this study belonged to the BJ94-like lineage that harbors a number of genomic features associated with replication in mammalian and human cells, although they seemingly have limited pathogenicity in humans ( Gao et al., 2019 26. Gao, W. ∙ Zu, Z. ∙ Liu, J. ... Prevailing I292V PB2 mutation in avian influenza H9N2 virus increases viral polymerase function and attenuates IFN-β induction in human cells J. Gen. Virol. 2019; 100 :1273-1281 Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2014 72. Song, W. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Mok, B.W.-Y. ... The K526R substitution in viral protein PB2 enhances the effects of E627K on influenza virus replication Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5509 Google Scholar ). It is, therefore, of considerable significance that we detected H9N2 in two game animal species—Asian badgers and civets from northern and eastern China, respectively ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Furthermore, the Asian badgers displayed obvious respiratory symptoms, suggesting a potential respiratory transmission route that increases the risk of disease transmission to humans.
Our study also revealed that game animals are important hosts for viruses that are related to diseases in human and/or domestic animals. Not only did we sample common zoonotic pathogens such as Rotavirus A , Rotavirus C , Alphacoronavirus 1, Orthohepevirus A , Mammalian orthoreovirus , and Mammalian orthorubulavirus 5 that are known to be harbored by a wide range of mammalian hosts, but we also identified viruses previously thought to be specific to certain host groups. For example, we present the first evidence of human pathogens such as Influenza B virus , HPIV2, and Norwalk virus in bamboo rats, Malayan pangolins, and civets, indicating human-to-wildlife transmission. Of note, Influenza B viruses have previously been identified in other mammalian species including seals and pigs ( Osterhaus et al., 2000 59. Osterhaus, A.D. ∙ Rimmelzwaan, G.F. ∙ Martina, B.E. ... Influenza B virus in seals Science. 2000; 288 :1051-1053 Google Scholar ; Ran et al., 2015 63. Ran, Z. ∙ Shen, H. ∙ Lang, Y. ... Domestic pigs are susceptible to infection with influenza B viruses J. Virol. 2015; 89 :4818-4826 Google Scholar ). Similarly, Miniopterus BatCoV-HKU8, Bovine respirovirus 3 , Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 , and Influenza A virus H9N2, which are predominantly found in bats, cattle, carnivores, and avian hosts, respectively, were now detected in a wide range of game animals from different mammalian orders than their perceived reservoir host groups. It is currently unclear how these viruses are maintained in these game animal species. Nevertheless, their capability to carry these viruses, even for a short period of time, may contribute to the virus transmission chains or the emergence of new variants. Indeed, the potential for game animals to act as a separate transmission chain might in part explain the sometimes sudden and unexpected emergence of new viral variants in humans or domestic animals, as observed in several norovirus outbreaks ( Villabruna et al., 2019 78. Villabruna, N. ∙ Koopmans, M.P.G. ∙ de Graaf, M. Animals as reservoir for human Norovirus Viruses. 2019; 11 :478 Google Scholar ). Our results also show that these viruses were present in seemingly healthy animals and that there is ongoing transmission among different species of game animals ( Figure 5 ). This again highlights the risk of close contact among game animals.
More broadly, our results provide important insights into those game animals and their viruses that might lead to the next pandemic or epizootic. Indeed, the viruses discovered in this study can be divided into two categories: those with restricted host range and those with the capability to infect animals from different mammalian orders and that, therefore, seem capable of overcoming host genetic barriers. The latter category merits most attention as they underpin the great majority of human epidemics and pandemics.
Despite its large scale, this study has several limitations. For some of the species considered such as pangolins, badgers, and foxes, the available sample size was limited, largely due to small population sizes and the endangered status of these animals. This prevented us from performing a more systematic comparison of viral diversity and abundance. In addition, meta-transcriptomics does not provide direct evidence of host associations. Although only mammalian-infecting viruses were targeted, it is possible that viruses identified from fecal samples might have originated from the consumption of other vertebrate animals, such that future confirmation of infection is required. Finally, some of the analyses utilized pooled samples, reducing the sensitivity of virus discovery to the extent that low abundance of viruses might go undetected.

Sampling of game animals was performed between June 2017 and December 2021 at locations representing the natural habitat of animals, artificial breeding sites and zoos across 20 provinces in China ( Table S1 ). Accordingly, a total of 3111 samples from 1941 animal individuals and 18 mammalian species ( Xiao et al., 2021 85. Xiao, X. ∙ Newman, C. ∙ Buesching, C.D. ... Animal sales from Wuhan wet markets immediately prior to the COVID-19 pandemic Sci. Rep. 2021; 11 :11898 Google Scholar ) were obtained. These comprised: Hystrix brachyura (Malayan porcupine, n =402), Myocastor coypus (coypu, n =303), Rhizomys pruinosus (hoary bamboo rat, n =349), Marmota himalayana (Himalayan marmot, n =19), Cynomys ludovicianus (prairie dog, n =60), Spermophilus dauricus (daurian ground squirrel, n =3), Callosciurus erythraeus (Pallas's squirrel, n =11), Sciurus vulgaris (Eurasian red squirrel, n =4) from the order Rodentia; Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin, n =21), Manis pentadactyla (Chinese pangolin, n =12) from the order Pholidota; Paguma larvata (civet, n =423), Nyctereutes procyonoides (raccoon dog, n =95), Arctonyx collaris (hog badger, n =1), Meles leucurus (Asian badger, n =60), Melogale moschata (Chinese ferret-badger, n =1), Vulpes lagopus (Arctic fox, n =16) from the order Carnivora; Erinaceus amurensis (Amur hedgehog, n =75) from the order Eulipotyphla; and Oryctolagus cuniculus (rabbit, n =86) from the order Lagomorpha ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Pharyngeal, anal, nasal and fecal swabs were obtained from living animals, whereas tissue samples (including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, stomach, and brain) were obtained from deceased animals. All animal specimens were kept in dry ice before transfer to a -80°C freezer for storage.
Host species information was initially identified by experienced field biologists upon capture based on morphological characteristics, then confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the cytochrome b ( CytB ) gene ( Guillén-Servent and Francis, 2006 29. Guillén-Servent, A. ∙ Francis, C.M. A new species of bat of the Hipposideros bicolor group (Chiroptera: Hipposideridae) from Central Laos, with evidence of convergent evolution with Sundaic taxa Acta Chiropterol. 2006; 8 :39-61 10.3161/1733-5329(2006)8[39:ANSOBO]2.0.CO;2 Google Scholar ). The procedures for sampling and sample processing were approved by the ethics committee of Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine (No. IACUC of AMMS-11-2020-012).
Samples were pooled according to the species, location, health condition, feeding (living) condition, for subsequent RNA extraction and library construction. Detailed information of each pool is shown in Table S1 . Total RNA from each pool was extracted using TRIzol® Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was subsequently removed using DNase I (Takara). Meta-transcriptome library preparation of each pool was carried out using the TruSeq™ Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation Kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA) after removal of host ribosomal RNA using Illumina Ribo-Zero™ rRNA Removal Kits (San Diego, CA). Paired-end (150 bp) sequencing of each RNA library was performed using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform.
For each library, sequencing reads were first quality controlled using bbduk.sh ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/ ; parameters, maq=10 qtrim=r trimq=10 ftl=1 minlen=90). The remaining reads were assembled de novo using MEGAHIT ( Li et al., 2015 45. Li, D. ∙ Liu, C.-M. ∙ Luo, R. ... MEGAHIT: an ultra-fast single-node solution for large and complex metagenomics assembly via succinct de Bruijn graph Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :1674-1676 Google Scholar ) (version 1.2.8) deploying default parameters. The assembled contigs were compared against the NCBI non-redundant protein database (nr) using Diamond blastx (version 0.9.25.26) ( Buchfink et al., 2021 14. Buchfink, B. ∙ Reuter, K. ∙ Drost, H.-G. Sensitive protein alignments at tree-of-life scale using DIAMOND Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :366-368 Google Scholar ). The E -value cut-off was set at 1 E -3 to maintain high sensitivity at a low false-positive rate. Taxonomic lineage information was obtained for the top blast hit of each contig, and those classified under kingdom “Viruses” were identified as probable virus hits. Contigs with unassembled overlaps were merged using the SeqMan program implemented in the Lasergene software package version 7.1 (DNAstar) ( Clewley, 1995 18. Clewley, J.P. Macintosh sequence analysis software DNAStar's Lasergene. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3 :221-224 Google Scholar ). The final virus genomes were verified by mapping reads to the corresponding contigs and inspecting the mapping results using Geneious ( Kearse et al., 2012 37. Kearse, M. ∙ Moir, R. ∙ Wilson, A. ... Geneious Basic: an integrated and extendable desktop software platform for the organization and analysis of sequence data Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :1647-1649 Google Scholar ). The presence of viruses was further verified using RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR on the original RNA samples with primer sets designed based on the viral genome sequences. The PCR products were then sequenced and compared with the original template. For incomplete viral genomes, the internal gaps were filled by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, whereas the genome termini were determined using RACE analyses.
Among the virus contigs described here, those likely associated with vertebrates, specifically vertebrate-specific viruses and vector-borne vertebrate viruses, were preliminarily identified based on the taxonomic lineage information of the blastx results and confirmed by phylogenetic analyses. Those grouping within a vertebrate-specific or vector-borne virus family/genus/group were subsequently identified as vertebrate viruses. We employed a simplified criterion of <80% nucleotide identity at the whole viral genome level to assign new virus species which were then verified by detailed phylogenetic analysis (see below).
Each virus sequence was first assigned to specific virus species based on the level of sequence similarity to each other and to reference sequences. To estimate the relative abundance of each virus species in each library, quality-trimmed reads were first mapped to the SILVA database ( www.arb-silva.de , version 132.1) using Bowtie2 (version 2.3.5.1) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 41. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Google Scholar ) to remove reads associated with ribosomal RNA. Unmapped reads were subsequently mapped to confirmed viral genomes using the “end-to-end” setting, and the abundance of each virus species was estimated as the number of mapped reads per million total reads (RPM) in each library. To limit false-positives, we set the RPM greater than or equal to 10 as providing evidence for a positive virus hit.
To infer the evolutionary history of all vertebrate-associated viruses here, we first assigned these viral sequences into their respective (vertebrate associated) viral family or genus based on the Diamond blastx results. The amino acid sequences of the viral replicase proteins (i.e. RNA viruses = RdRp domain; DNA viruses = capsid protein) of these virus genomes were then aligned with those of related viruses downloaded from GenBank using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 36. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Google Scholar ) (version 7.475), employing the L-INS-I algorithm. Following sequence alignment, all ambiguous aligned regions were removed using TrimAL ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 15. Capella-Gutiérrez, S. ∙ Silla-Martínez, J.M. ∙ Gabaldón, T. trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1972-1973 Google Scholar ) (version 1.2). Phylogenetic trees were then estimated for the sequence alignment of each family using the maximum likelihood method available in PhyML (version 3.1) ( Guindon and Gascuel, 2003 30. Guindon, S. ∙ Gascuel, O. A simple, fast, and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood Syst. Biol. 2003; 52 :696-704 Google Scholar ), employing the LG model of amino acid substitution and a subtree pruning and the regrafting (SPR) branch swapping algorithm. A similar procedure was utilized for intra-specific virus phylogenetic trees, with the exception that greater sequence identity meant that genome-scale nucleotide sequences were used in sequence alignments and a general-time reversible (GTR) substitution model was employed for phylogenetic inference.
We tested for the presence of recombination using the PHI-test ( Bruen et al., 2006 13. Bruen, T.C. ∙ Philippe, H. ∙ Bryant, D. A simple and robust statistical test for detecting the presence of recombination Genetics. 2006; 172 :2665-2681 Google Scholar ). Neighbor-Net reconstructions were performed using SplitsTree version 4 ( Huson, 1998 35. Huson, D.H. SplitsTree: a program for analyzing and visualizing evolutionary data Bioinformatics. 1998; 14 :68-73 Google Scholar ) based on Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano ( Hasegawa et al., 1985 31. Hasegawa, M. ∙ Kishino, H. ∙ Yano, T. Dating of the human-ape splitting by a molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA J. Mol. Evol. 1985; 22 :160-174 Google Scholar ) pairwise distances with empirical base frequencies (excluding gap sites). Edge support was calculated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. For visualization, we filtered out splits with bootstrap support values <75%. Recombination patterns for CCoV-2 and the four novel raccoon dog coronaviruses were further analyzed using RDP4 ( Martin et al., 2015 54. Martin, D.P. ∙ Murrell, B. ∙ Golden, M. ... RDP4: detection and analysis of recombination patterns in virus genomes Virus Evol. 2015; 1 :vev003 Google Scholar ). We used conservative settings for recombination detection in order to identify relative sizeable breakpoint-free regions. Specifically, our RDP4 analysis combined the RDP method (with a window size of 100 bp) ( Martin and Rybicki, 2000 53. Martin, D. ∙ Rybicki, E. RDP: detection of recombination amongst aligned sequences Bioinformatics. 2000; 16 :562-563 Google Scholar ), the Geneconv method ( Sawyer, 1989 66. Sawyer, S. Statistical tests for detecting gene conversion Mol. Biol. Evol. 1989; 6 :526-538 Google Scholar ), the MaxChi method (considering windows of 100 variable positions) ( Smith, 1992 71. Smith, J.M. Analyzing the mosaic structure of genes J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34 :126-129 Google Scholar ), the BootScan method (with a window size of 500 bp) ( Salminen et al., 1995 65. Salminen, M. ∙ Carr, J.K. ∙ Burke, D.S. ... Identification of breakpoints in intergenotype recombinants of HIV type 1 by bootscanning AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovir. 1995; 11 :1423-1425 Google Scholar ), the SiScan method (with a window size of 500 bp) ( Gibbs et al., 2000 27. Gibbs, M.J. ∙ Armstrong, J.S. ∙ Gibbs, A.J. Sister-scanning: a Monte Carlo procedure for assessing signals in recombinant sequences Bioinformatics. 2000; 16 :573-582 Google Scholar ) and the 3Seq method ( Boni et al., 2007 11. Boni, M.F. ∙ Posada, D. ∙ Feldman, M.W. An exact nonparametric method for inferring mosaic structure in sequence triplets Genetics. 2007; 176 :1035-1047 Google Scholar ). We identified mosaic patterns in all genomes based on those recombination events detected by >3 methods. For the two largest breakpoint-free regions identified by the RDP4 analysis, we performed maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference using IQ-Tree (version 2.0.3) ( Minh et al., 2020 56. Minh, B.Q. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ Chernomor, O. ... IQ-TREE 2: new models and efficient methods for phylogenetic inference in the genomic era Mol. Biol. Evol. 2020; 37 :1530-1534 Google Scholar ), utilizing the GTR substitution model ( Tavare, 1986 75. Tavare, S. Some probabilistic and statistical problems in the analysis of DNA sequences Lectures on Mathematics in the Life Sciences. 1986; 17 :57-86 Google Scholar ) with a gamma-distributed rate variation among sites ( Yang, 1994 87. Yang, Z. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation from DNA sequences with variable rates over sites: approximate methods J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39 :306-314 Google Scholar ). Bootstrap support values were calculated using the ultrafast bootstrap method ( Minh et al., 2013 55. Minh, B.Q. ∙ Nguyen, M.A.T. ∙ von Haeseler, A. Ultrafast approximation for phylogenetic bootstrap Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :1188-1195 Google Scholar ) with 1,000 replicates.
All computational and statistical analyses were performed with the open-source software tools referenced in the STAR Methods along with the described procedures.
