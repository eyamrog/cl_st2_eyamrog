Title: Structural basis of assembly and torque transmission of the bacterial flagellar motor


Abstract: Summary

The bacterial flagellar motor is a supramolecular protein machine that drives rotation of the flagellum for motility, which is essential for bacterial survival in different environments and a key determinant of pathogenicity. The detailed structure of the flagellar motor remains unknown. Here we present an atomic-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the bacterial flagellar motor complexed with the hook, consisting of 175 subunits with a molecular mass of approximately 6.3 MDa. The structure reveals that 10 peptides protruding from the MS ring with the FlgB and FliE subunits mediate torque transmission from the MS ring to the rod and overcome the symmetry mismatch between the rotational and helical structures in the motor. The LP ring contacts the distal rod and applies electrostatic forces to support its rotation and torque transmission to the hook. This work provides detailed molecular insights into the structure, assembly, and torque transmission mechanisms of the flagellar motor.

Section: Introduction

Bacterial swimming and swarming motility is required for bacterial survival in different environments and biofilm formation and plays a variety of roles in pathogenesis, including reaching the optimal host site and invasion ( Moens and Vanderleyden, 1996 42.

Subramanian, S. ∙ Kearns, D.B. Functional Regulators of Bacterial Flagella Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73 :225-246 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). The bacterial flagellum is a huge protein machinery for bacterial swimming and swarming and is composed of about 25 different proteins, including structural and regulatory components ( Armitage and Berry, 2020 5.

Structure and Energy-Conversion Mechanism of the Bacterial Na + -Driven Flagellar Motor Trends Microbiol. 2020; 28 :719-731 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of the flagellum consists of three distinct parts: a rotary motor, a universal joint, and a helical propeller ( Berg, 2003 6. Berg, H.C. The rotary motor of bacterial flagella Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72 :19-54 Crossref Scopus (1133) PubMed Google Scholar ; Carroll and Liu, 2020 8. Carroll, B.L. ∙ Liu, J.

Bacterial flagellar motor Q. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 41 :103-132 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rotary motor is powered by an ion-conducting stator, MotAB or PomAB, and is the assembly base of the flagellum ( Deme et al., 2020 14. Deme, J.C. ∙ Johnson, S. ∙ Vickery, O. ...

It spans the cytoplasmic and outer membranes and consists of the L ring, P ring, MS ring, C ring, the rod, and the export apparatus. The universal joint is the hook connecting the motor to the filament, which functions as the propeller of the flagellum to propel the bacterial cell and confer motility ( Nakamura and Minamino, 2019 44. Nakamura, S. ∙ Minamino, T. Flagella-Driven Motility of Bacteria Biomolecules. 2019; 9 :279 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The flagellar motor has an export apparatus in the cytoplasm, similar to that of bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SSs), to translocate the flagellar proteins across bacterial membranes ( Johnson et al., 2019 26. Johnson, S. ∙ Kuhlen, L. ∙ Deme, J.C. ...

Rep. 2013; 3 :3369 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been proposed that the bacterial flagellum is the evolutionary ancestor of T3SSs ( Deng et al., 2017 15.

Bacterial nanomachines: the flagellum and type III injectisome Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2 :a000299 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike the T3SS basal body, which is fixed in bacterial membranes, the MS ring, C ring, and rod of the flagellar motor rotate at high speeds when they function ( Armitage and Berry, 2020 5.

Magariyama, Y. ∙ Sugiyama, S. ∙ Muramoto, K. ... Very fast flagellar rotation Nature. 1994; 371 :752 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rotary MS ring in the bacterial inner membrane is assembled by the protein FliF ( Ueno et al., 1992 60. Ueno, T. ∙ Oosawa, K. ∙ Aizawa, S. M ring, S ring and proximal rod of the flagellar basal body of Salmonella typhimurium are composed of subunits of a single protein, FliF J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227 :672-677 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been found that the MS ring contains about 24–36 copies of FliF with mixed internal symmetries ( Johnson et al., 2020 27. Johnson, S. ∙ Fong, Y.H. ∙ Deme, J.C. ...

The C ring, which acts as the switch complex of the flagellar motor for rotational direction switching, is formed by the proteins FliG, FliM, and FliN and interacts dynamically with the cytoplasmic side of the MS ring ( Chang et al., 2020 9.

The rod is coaxial with the MS ring and the LP ring and is made up of subunits of FliE, FlgB, FlgC, FlgF, and FlgG ( Homma et al., 1990b 24. Homma, M. ∙ Kutsukake, K. ∙ Hasebe, M. ...

The outer-membrane L ring and the periplasmic P ring are assembled by the proteins FlgH and FlgI, respectively ( Jones et al., 1987 28. Jones, C.J. ∙ Homma, M. ∙ Macnab, R.M.

Because of its complexity, the flagellar motor is a highly challenging topic for biochemistry and structural biology studies. Many advances regarding its function, low-resolution imaging analyses, and force generation by the stator MotAB/PomAB, have been made during the past few decades ( Carroll and Liu, 2020 8. Carroll, B.L. ∙ Liu, J. Structural Conservation and Adaptation of the Bacterial Flagella Motor Biomolecules. 2020; 10 :1492 Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar ; Deme et al., 2020 14.

Structure and Function of Stator Units of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor Cell. 2020; 183 :244-257.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Biochemical analyses have provided predictions regarding the stoichiometry of the components of the flagellar motor ( Jones et al., 1990 30. Jones, C.J. ∙ Macnab, R.M. ∙ Okino, H. ...

The three-dimensional structure of the flagellar rotor from a clockwise-locked mutant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188 :7039-7048 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the detailed structure and the assembly and torque transmission mechanisms of the flagellar motor are still obscure. In this study, we determined the atomic-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the flagellar motor in complex with the hook in the assembled state from Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. This work provides high-resolution structural insights into the assembly and torque transmission mechanisms of the flagellar motor.

Section: Results

To investigate the structure of the flagellar motor, we generated a mutant strain of the S . enterica Typhimurium LT2 strain with double deletion of the genes of the filament protein FliC and its cap protein FliD to avoid effects of the flagellar filaments on purification of the motor. The mutant strain of S. Typhimurium produced the motor and the hook normally but did not assemble the filament. We designed a mild purification procedure for the motor particles based on previous studies ( Aizawa, 2017 3. Aizawa, S.-I.

Purification and characterization of the flagellar hook-basal body complex of Salmonella typhimurium J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161 :836-849 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Francis et al., 1994 19. Francis, N.R. ∙ Sosinsky, G.E. ∙ Thomas, D. ... Isolation, characterization and structure of bacterial flagellar motors containing the switch complex J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235 :1261-1270 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). The purified motor sample was highly stable in negative staining and cryo-EM analyses ( Figures S1 A–S1C). As expected, the intact hook was contained in the purified motor particles. Because of the dynamic interactions of the stator MotA/B and the C ring with the MS ring ( Armitage and Berry, 2020 5. Armitage, J.P. ∙ Berry, R.M. Assembly and Dynamics of the Bacterial Flagellum Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 74 :181-200 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), negative staining analysis revealed that the stator and the C ring were not included in the particles. The initial reconstruction of the cryo-EM imaging data by C1 symmetry generated an average 3.9-Å density map of the motor-hook complex with global refinement, a 3.7-Å density map of the rod with the export apparatus and partial hook regions along the rod axis, and a 4.5-Å density map of the MS ring with the surrounded proximal rod and the export apparatus with local refinements. Further local refinements improved the resolution of the LP ring to 2.8 Å with C26 symmetry; that of the MS ring to 3.6 Å with C34 symmetry; that of the hook to 3.4 Å that of the rod to 3.3 Å; and those of the distal rod, proximal rod, and export apparatus with FliE subunits to 3.2 Å, 3.2 Å, and 3.6 Å, respectively, with C1 symmetry ( Figures S1 D, S1E, and S2 A; Table S1 ).
The final structural model of the flagellar motor-hook complex contains 175 subunits from 12 proteins, which include 26 FlgH subunits in the L ring; 26 FlgI subunits in the P ring; 6 FliE, 5 FlgB, 6 FlgC, 5 FlgF, and 24 FlgG subunits in the rod; 5 FliP, 1 FliR, and 4 FliQ subunits in the export apparatus; 34 FliF subunits in the MS ring; and 33 FlgE subunits in part of the hook ( Figures 1 A–1C). The whole structure of the motor-hook complex has a molecular weight of ∼6.3 MDa with a height of 460 Å. The part of the hook is in a curved state in the complex and is bound to the distal rod. The L and P rings interact tightly with each other and form the barrel-shaped LP ring. The distal rod, composed of FlgF and FlgG subunits, is surrounded by the LP ring ( Figures 1 B and 1D). The proximal rod, consisting of FliE, FlgB, and FlgC subunits, is relatively thin and bound to the export apparatus ( Figure 1 B). The MS ring embraces the export apparatus and the FliE- and FlgB-containing part of the proximal rod ( Figures 1 B, 1E, and 1F). Density maps of the MS ring obtained in local refinement did not reveal a clear transmembrane region, resulting in lack of a model of the inner membrane-binding domain of the MS ring in the complex structure. The overall structure of the motor-hook complex is larger and more complex than the T3SS basal body structure ( Hu et al., 2019 25. Hu, J. ∙ Worrall, L.J. ∙ Vuckovic, M. ...

The LP ring consists of 26 mature FlgH protomers (residues C22–M232) and 26 mature FlgI protomers (residues E20–I365) ( Figure 2 A). The L ring adopts a double-layered β-barrel structure, whereas the P ring contains three subrings ( Figure 2 B). The FlgH protomer in the L ring has an oblique arrow-like shape and consists of a long N-terminal loop (L N ), six central β strands (β1–β6), and three α helices (α1–α3) ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Strands β1, β2, and β5 form the long, inclined, anti-parallel β sheet S1, whose oligomerization forms the inner β-barrel of the L ring. Strands β3, β4, and β6 constitute the relatively short β sheet S2, whose oligomerization forms the outer β-barrel of the L ring ( Figure 2 B). S1 and S2 interact with each other through hydrophobic interactions via their N-terminal parts ( Figures 2 E, S3 A, and S3B). In FlgH oligomerization for the L ring, S1 interacts with the C-terminal regions, and the linking hairpins of the S2 sheets of the prior two FlgH subunits, whereas S2 binds to the middle regions of the S1 sheets of the next two FlgH subunits ( Figures 2 F and S3 C). The crossed interprotomer interactions of S1 and S2 not only connect the FlgH subunits in the L ring but also stabilize packing of the inner β-barrel with the outer β-barrel.
On the outer surface of the L ring, the N-terminal part (residues C22–V44) of the L N loop binds to the S2 sheets of the next two FlgH subunits and extends its N terminus upward to interact with the C-terminal α2 and α3 helices of the two FlgH subunits ( Figure 2 F). The C-terminal region (residues P45–D76) of the L N loop functions as a hanger to bind four FlgI subunits of the P ring ( Figures 2 F and 2K). The outer membrane-binding region of the L ring is formed by the horizontally arrayed α1 and α3 helices ( Figure 2 F). The first residue of the L N loop, Cys22, has been suggested to be modified by fatty acylation ( Schoenhals and Macnab, 1996 50. Schoenhals, G.J. ∙ Macnab, R.M. Physiological and biochemical analyses of FlgH, a lipoprotein forming the outer membrane L ring of the flagellar basal body of Salmonella typhimurium J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178 :4200-4207 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, clear electron density for a fatty acyl group could be observed on Cys22 in the density map of the L ring ( Figures 2 E). The fatty acyl group is inserted into the hydrophobic gap between the α3 helices of the next two FlgH subunits, which fixes the N termini of the FlgH subunits into the bacterial outer membrane ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Consistent with crucial roles in FlgH oligomerization for the L ring, deletion of the C-terminal helices and mutation of the residue Cys22 abolishes bacterial motility ( Schoenhals and Macnab, 1996 50. Schoenhals, G.J. ∙ Macnab, R.M. Physiological and biochemical analyses of FlgH, a lipoprotein forming the outer membrane L ring of the flagellar basal body of Salmonella typhimurium J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178 :4200-4207 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
The FlgI protomer adopts a twisted “V” shape and consists of an N-terminal D1 domain and two C-terminal ring-building motif (RBM) domains, RBM1 and RBM2 ( Figures 2 H and 2I). The three domains of FlgI constitute the upper (D1), outer (RBM1) and bottom (RBM2) subrings, respectively, of the P ring ( Figures 2 B and 2J). The D1 domain contains a core small β-barrel subdomain, a relatively separated helix α2, and the protruding linking loops L2 and L3 ( Figure 2 I). The RBM1 and RBM2 domains adopt a conserved β-α fold that exists in the T3SS components PrgK, PrgH, and InvG for formation of periplasmic rings ( Spreter et al., 2009 55. Spreter, T. ∙ Yip, C.K. ∙ Sanowar, S. ... A conserved structural motif mediates formation of the periplasmic rings in the type III secretion system Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 :468-476 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, FlgI does not exhibit sequence similarity with these T3SS components, indicating separate but convergent evolution of FlgI and the T3SS components for periplasmic binding.
During formation of the P ring, the D1 domain interacts extensively with neighboring D1 domains ( Figures 2 J and S3 D), whereas the RBM1-RBM1 interfaces in the RBM1 subring are relatively small and rely mainly on interactions of the lateral α helices of RBM1 domains ( Figure S3 E). In the bottom RBM2 subring, the β1, β2, and β5 strands form a five-stranded antiparallel β sheet with β3 and β4 of the next RBM2 domain ( Figure S3 F). In turn, β3 and β4 of the RBM2 domain form an antiparallel β sheet with the β1, β2, and β5 strands of the prior RBM2 domain. This head-tail conjugation of the RBM2 domains results in tight assembly of the bottom RBM2 subring in the P ring. The D1 domain also forms cross-subring interactions with the RBM1 and RBM2 domains of the next FlgI subunits, which firmly connects the three subrings of the P ring ( Figures S3 G and S3H).
At the L-P interface, the FlgH and FlgI subunits interact with each other in a 1-versus-4 manner ( Figure 2 K). The C-terminal region of the L N loop of FlgH binds sequentially to the D1 domains of four FlgI subunits ( Figure 2 L). The bottom hairpins of the S2 sheet of FlgH also interact with α2 and L3 of the prior FlgI subunit. In turn, a D1 domain in the P ring captures four L N loops and one S2 sheet from four FlgH subunits of the L ring. The large interface between the L ring and the P ring indicates the high stability of the LP ring in the flagellar motor. Consistently, the intact LP ring complex could be observed even after disassembly of the flagellum ( Kaplan et al., 2019b 32. Kaplan, M. ∙ Subramanian, P. ∙ Ghosal, D. ...

Sequence analysis revealed that the residues involved in oligomerization of FlgH and FlgI for formation of the LP ring are highly conserved, suggesting that assembly of FlgH and FlgI subunits for the LP ring is conserved across bacterial species ( Figures S3 I–S3K). However, the residues on the outer surface of the LP ring are highly variable in bacteria carrying the Na + -driven flagellum, in which additional H and T rings are suggested to bind to the L ring and P ring, respectively, for fitness under harsh environmental conditions ( Kaplan et al., 2019a 31.

Minamino, T. ∙ Imada, K. The bacterial flagellar motor and its structural diversity Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23 :267-274 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of the LP ring is significantly different from the C15-symmetric structure of the outer membrane-bound secretin of the bacterial T3SSs ( Hu et al., 2019 25. Hu, J. ∙ Worrall, L.J. ∙ Vuckovic, M. ... T3S injectisome needle complex structures in four distinct states reveal the basis of membrane coupling and assembly Nat.

Near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM analysis of the Salmonella T3S injectisome basal body Nature. 2016; 540 :597-601 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 L). The inclined S1 sheet of FlgH is much longer than the inner-barrel β sheet of secretin and results in a larger innermost diameter of the LP ring ( Figure S3 M).
In the rod, the 6 FliE, 5 FlgB, 6 FlgC, 5 FlgF, and 24 FlgG subunits are packed sequentially from the proximal end to the distal end in a right-handed manner along the 1-start helical direction with helical parameters of ∼4.3 Å and ∼64.7° and are assembled into a prayer wheel shape for the rod ( Figures 3 A). The structure of the rod is divided into the thicker and double-layered tubular distal rod and the single-layered tubular proximal rod ( Figure S4 A).
The rod proteins harbor distinctive structural features ( Figures 3 B–3F and S4 B–S4E). FliE is the simplest and consists of only three α helices: α1, α2, and α3 ( Figure 3 B). The N-terminal α1 is separated from the rod structure and binds to the inner surface of the MS ring (details are shown below). Helices α2 and α3 correspond to the α N and α C helices, respectively, of the D0 domains in other rod proteins ( Figure S4 C), although they do not contain any heptad repeats or the ANNLAN consensus sequence characteristic of the α N and α C helices ( Homma et al., 1990a 23.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174 :2298-2304 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the 6 FliE subunits, the first subunit, FliE 1 , lacks a clear density map of the α2 helix, probably because of special interactions with the FliR subunit of the export apparatus ( Figure 3 B). In addition to the D0 domain, the other rod proteins harbor a Dc domain ( Figures 3 C–3F). The FlgB Dc domain contains a unique α B helix and extends a flexible loop region to interact with the MS ring ( Figure 3 C). The FlgC Dc domain contains a protruding loop (L C ) and a cap region that consists of a short β sheet and a long loop ( Figures 3 D). The featured structures of FlgC provide a molecular basis for its function as a transitional protein linking the proximal and distal rods. FlgF and FlgG have an additional D1 domain and adopt similar structures ( Figures 3 E, 3F, and S4 E). FlgF has a characteristic loop (L6) and helix (α3) in its D1 domain, which results in the FlgF-containing part of the distal rod having a diameter larger than the inner diameter of the P ring, and precisely coordinates the position of the distal rod within the LP ring ( Figures 1 B and S4 E). The Dc domain of FlgG is much longer than that of FlgF and contains a unique FlgG-specific sequence (GSS) region (residues Y46–P63) that consists of two antiparallel β strands with a long linking loop ( Figures 3 F, S4 D, and S4E).
Each subunit in the rod forms extensive interactions and interlocks with adjacent subunits ( Figure 3 A). In the inner D0 tube, hydrophobic interactions mediate stacking of the D0 domain with all six neighboring D0 domains ( Figure S5 A). Although FliE does not show sequence similarities to the D0 domains, the hydrophobic residues in the α2 and α3 helices mimic the heptad repeat to interact with the D0 domains of the FlgB and FlgC subunits. The N-terminal α N helices of the rod proteins are longer than that of FlgE ( Figure S5 B). Along the 11-start helical direction, the α N helix of a subunit directly contacts the α C helix of the prior subunit ( Figure S5 C). Moreover, each D0 domain interacts with the Dc domains of the subunits along the 5- and −11-start helical directions, which strongly reinforces stacking of the D0 domains in the inner tube of the rod ( Figures 3 A and S5 A). The head-to-tail interactions of the D0 domains and the Dc reinforcements result in the inner tube in the rod in the straight form.
In addition to the D0 domains, the Dc and D1 domains of the rod proteins build up extensive intersubunit interactions ( Figure 3 A). In the proximal rod, along the 5-start helical direction, the residues F45, L49, and M53 of the Dc domain of FlgB form strong hydrophobic stacking with F11 of the α N helix of the FlgB D0 domain and Leu61 of FliE ( Figures 3 G, 3H, and S4 F). Along the 11-start helical direction, the Dc domain of FlgF interacts with the upper loop region of the Dc domain of FlgB. Along the 6-start helical direction, the α N helix of FlgC binds to the FlgB Dc domain to enhance the FlgB-FlgC interactions ( Figures 3 I, 3J, and S4 G). In the distal rod, each FlgF subunit interacts with four FlgG subunits ( Figure 3 K). The D1 domains of the FlgF subunits interact with adjacent D1 domains of FlgG subunits along the 5-, 6-, and 11-start helical directions. The long Dc domain of the FlgG subunit at the 5-start position extends downward to embrace the D1 domain of the FlgF subunit and interacts with the cap region of the FlgC Dc domain, which not only ties the inner and outer tubes of the distal rod but also strengthens the connection of the distal rod with the proximal rod ( Figures 3 K, 3L, S4 H, and S5 D–S5H).
The FlgG GSS region is also involved in the intersubunit interactions in the distal rod and is crucial for maintaining its rigidity. On the outer surface of the distal rod, the interactions of a D1 domain of the FlgF or FlgG subunit with those of two neighboring FlgG subunits along the 11- and 6-start helical directions generate an open cave at the center ( Figures 3 A and S5 I). The Dc domain of the FlgG subunit at the 16-start position inserts the unique GSS region as a wedge into the cave and stably interacts with the three D1 domains, which greatly strengthens the rigidity of the distal rod ( Figures 3 A, 3M, 3N, S4 I, and S5 J). Consistent with the importance of the GSS region in the rigidity of the distal rod, insertion of the GSS region into the corresponding region in the Dc domain of FlgE in the Salmonella genome made the hook of the bacteria straight and more rigid ( Hiraoka et al., 2017 22. Hiraoka, K.D. ∙ Morimoto, Y.V. ∙ Inoue, Y. ... Straight and rigid flagellar hook made by insertion of the FlgG specific sequence into FlgE Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :46723 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the Dc domain of FlgE is much shorter than that of FlgG ( Figure S4 E), the Dc domains of the FlgE subunits at the rod-hook interface cannot reach the 16 caves formed by the D1 domains of the FlgG 9–24 subunits along the 6-start directions and leave empty cavities on the distal rod surface ( Figures 3 A and S5 I), suggesting that the upper and lower regions of the distal rod likely have different rigidities to enable torque transmission and the connection with the hook, respectively.
The 3.4-Å-resolution map of the hook enabled us to build 33 FlgE subunits in the model ( Figure S2 A). The structure of the hook has a curved tubular architecture of three layers that are assembled by the D0, D1, and D2 domains of FlgE subunits, respectively ( Figures S6 A–S6E). At the rod-hook interface, 11 FlgE subunits (FlgE 1–11 ) interact directly with 11 FlgG subunits (FlgG 14–24 ) ( Figures 4 A–4C). The FlgE subunits insert their D0 domains into the inner tube of the distal rod, which forms stable D0 FlgE -D0 FlgG hydrophobic stacking and connects the inner tube of the hook to that of the distal rod ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Packing of the FlgE and FlgG subunits along the 1-start helical direction at the interface results in each of the FlgE 1–5 subunits interacting with three FlgG subunits. FlgE 6 contacts two FlgG subunits (FlgG 19 and FlgG 24 ), whereas each of the FlgE 7-11 subunits interacts with one FlgG subunit ( Figures 4 E, S6 F, and S6G). All D1 domains of the FlgE 1–11 subunits bind directly to adjacent D1 domains of FlgG subunits, generating a continuous D1 FlgG -D1 FlgE domain interface and substantially connecting the middle tube of the hook with the outer tube of the distal rod ( Figures 4 B and 4F). The Dc domains of FlgE 1–11 subunits insert into the clefts underlying the D1 domains of FlgG and FlgE along the 6-start helical direction and interact with their D0, Dc, and D1 domains, which further strengthens the interactions of the inner and middle tubes of the hook with the distal rod ( Figures 4 E, 4G, S6 F, and S6G). Thus, the extensive interactions of the D0, D1, and Dc domains of FlgE subunits with those of FlgG subunits at the rod-hook interface build up tight tubular junctions of the hook with the distal rod ( Figures 4 A and S5 I), which ensures efficient torque transmission from the rod to the hook. In contrast, the D2 domain of FlgE, which is separated from its D1 domain, has no interaction with the rod and, therefore, is not involved in torque transmission ( Figure 4 B).
The rod binds to the export apparatus via the FliE and FlgB subunits ( Figure 5 A). At the interface, the C-terminal regions of the FliE α3 helices and the FlgB α C helices are inserted obliquely into the lumen of the export apparatus. The N termini of the α2 helices of the FliE 2–5 subunits bind sequentially to the four grooves formed by the two neighboring subunits of FliP 1–5 ( Figure 5 A). The α2 helix of the FliE 6 subunit is bound in the groove between FliR and the FliP 5 subunit. In turn, the N-terminal helix bundles of the FliR and FliP subunits are embedded upward into the grooves between FliE and FlgB subunits ( Figures 5 A–5C). The interactions of the N-terminal α1 helices of the FliR and FliP subunits with the FliE α3 helices mimic the helical packing of the α C helices in the inner D0 tube of the rod ( Figures 5 B–5D), suggesting that the FliR and FliP subunits of the export apparatus form the base for helical assembly of the inner tube of the rod.
In the FliE interactions with FliR and FliP, residues V99, M100, M102, and V104 in the α3 helices of the FliE subunits form strong hydrophobic interactions with the N-terminal helix hairpin 1 of FliR or FliP ( Figure 5 E). The αc helix and the N termini of the FlgB subunits interact with the N-terminal helices of the FliP subunits via hydrophobic and polar residues, including M130, V133, L134, L5, and R4 ( Figure 5 F). The interactions of the FliE 1 α3 helix with FliR also mainly include hydrophobic interactions ( Figure 5 B). The extensive hydrophobic interactions of FliE and FlgB with the FliP and FliR subunits stably fix the proximal rod onto the export apparatus, suggesting that the export apparatus likely rotates together with the rod during motor functions. It has been suggested that FliE and FlgB are involved in activation of the export apparatus ( Burrage et al., 2018 7. Burrage, A.M. ∙ Vanderpool, E. ∙ Kearns, D.B. Assembly Order of Flagellar Rod Subunits in Bacillus subtilis J. Bacteriol. 2018; 200 e00425-e18 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2013 63. Zhao, X. ∙ Zhang, K. ∙ Boquoi, T. ... Cryoelectron tomography reveals the sequential assembly of bacterial flagella in Borrelia burgdorferi Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :14390-14395 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, compared with the previously reported structure of the rod-free export apparatus ( Kuhlen et al., 2018 36. Kuhlen, L. ∙ Abrusci, P. ∙ Johnson, S. ... Structure of the core of the type III secretion system export apparatus Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :583-590 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ), binding of the FliE and FlgB subunits onto the export apparatus leads to outward movements of the N-terminal helices of FliP and FliR subunits by 13–30 Å ( Figures S6 H–S6J), respectively, and opens the channel of the export apparatus, suggesting that FliE and FlgB subunits activate and remodel the export apparatus to be a platform for assembly of the rod.
How the LP ring facilitates rotation and torque transmission of the rod when the flagellum rotates at high speeds is unclear. The distal rod is accommodated coaxially within the LP ring ( Figure 6 A). The L ring has an inner diameter that is ∼130 Å larger than the diameter of the distal rod, making no direct physical interactions with the FlgG-containing part of the distal rod ( Figure 6 B). Surface electrostatic potential analysis reveals that the top region of the inner surface of the L ring is fully charged with negative charges, which produce electrostatic repulsion to the distal rod that is also charged negatively for rotation. The middle and bottom regions of the inner surface of the L ring are charged positively and generate electrostatic attraction to the rod, which likely maintains the balance and coaxial orientation of the distal rod during its high-speed rotation ( Figures 6 C and 6D).
Unlike the L ring, the P ring interacts directly with the distal rod via the inner D1 subring ( Figure 6 E). The relatively separated α2 helix and the protruding L2 and L3 loops in the D1 domain of FlgI form the innermost edge of the P ring. The polar residues, including Q51, T53, Q54, N78, Q80, and K82, from the L2 and L3 loops on the inner surface of the D1 subring of the P ring interact with the FlgF 3–5 , FlgG 1–8 , and FlgG 14–19 subunits within distances of 2.6–3.5 Å ( Figures 6 F and 6G). The major P ring-interacting residues are asparagine, glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate, located in the D1 domains of the FlgF 3–5 and FlgG 1–8 subunits and in the GSS regions of the FlgG 14–19 subunits ( Figures 6 F and 6H–6J). The short distances of these hydrophilic residue-pair interactions indicate that the inner D1 subring of the P ring likely forms a hydrogen bond ring around the distal rod ( Figures 6 F). The hydrogen bonds formed by the invariant polar residues in the inner D1 subring of the P ring with the relatively invariant interacting residues of the FlgG and FlgF subunits allow the P ring to act as a ball bearing to stabilize the central localization of the rod in the P ring and enable rotation of the distal rod without significant structural obstacles or energy consumption. Thus, the LP ring applies electrostatic forces and a hydrogen bond ring to facilitate high-speed rotation and torque transmission of the rod.
The 4.5-Å-resolution density map of the MS ring with the surrounded proximal rod and the export apparatus shows that the MS ring has significant mixed internal symmetries and is composed of 34 β-collar, 34 RBM3, and 23 RBM2 domains of FliF in the β-collar, RBM3, and bottom inner RBM2 subrings, respectively ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and S1 D). Further refinements of the β-collar and RBM3 subrings with C34 symmetry improved their density map to a resolution of 3.6 Å ( Figure S1 D). The structure of a FliF protomer in the MS ring contains RBM2, RBM3, and β-collar domains but lacks the RBM1 domain and inner membrane-binding region because of the lack of density ( Figure 7 A). The MS ring forms a very large lumen to accommodate the export apparatus and the FliE- and FlgB-containing part of the proximal rod ( Figures 1 B and 7 G). The ∼98-Å diameter of the export apparatus is larger than the inner diameter of the upper β-collar subring, which prevents the export apparatus and the rod from dropping out from the MS ring ( Figure 7 B). The RBM2 subring also interacts with and stabilizes the export apparatus at the bottom side via the loop 1 and loop 2 regions ( Figure 7 H).
The MS ring not only functions as a structural component of the flagellar motor but is also responsible for torque transmission to the rod. In the motor-hook complex, the 3.2-Å-resolution density map of the proximal rod clearly reveals 5 pairs of L1 and L2 peptides, all of which are extended from the β-collar subring of the MS ring, bind to the outer surface of the proximal rod ( Figures 7 A–7C). The L1 peptides are bound into five shallow grooves formed by the upper regions of the FlgB Dc domains and the lower regions of the FlgF Dc domains with the L C loops of FlgCs ( Figure 7 D). The residues of the L1 peptide (residues G311–P331) have been precisely identified in the map and are located in the flexible region that links the β3 and β4 strands of the β-collar domain of FliF ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and S7 A). Each L1 peptide interacts with the FlgB, FlgC, and FlgF subunits through main-chain hydrogen bonds with hydrophobic contacts ( Figures 7 E and S7 D). The five L1 peptides also interact with the inner surface of the β-collar subring via residues N318 and Q319 ( Figures S7 F and S7G).
Adjacent to the L1-binding grooves, the FlgB Dc domains also form 5 open pockets with adjacent FlgC, FlgG, and FlgF subunits that are packed along the 5-, 16-, and 11-start helical directions, respectively ( Figure 7 D). Each of the open pockets accommodates an L2 peptide. The densities of the L2 peptide allowed us to build 15 alanine residues for its model but limited precise determination of its sequence ( Figure S7 B). Given the distance of the C terminus of L2 to the MS ring, the L2 peptide likely contains the residues T 333 NQQNAQNTPQTSTS 347 , which are located in the C-terminal region of the flexible loop that links the β3 and β4 strands of FliF ( Figure 7 A). Like L1, the L2 peptide interacts with the rod mainly via main-chain hydrogen bonds with a few hydrophobic interactions ( Figures 7 F and S7 E). The five pairs of L1 and L2 peptides are organized axially on the surface of the rod along the 1-start helical direction in a right-handed manner via the same axial helical parameters as those used by the rod proteins ( Figures 7 C and S7 C). Given the short sequences between the L1 or L2 peptides with the β3 or β4 strands ( Figure 7 A), the long distance of ∼23 Å between the N terminus of the L1 peptide and the C terminus of its neighboring L2 peptide ( Figure S7 H) suggests that a pair of adjacent L1 and L2 peptides are extended from two FliF subunits.
In addition to the L1- and L2-mediated MS ring-rod interactions, the 4.5-Å density map of the MS ring with the surrounded proximal rod and the export apparatus shows that a linking loop following the α B helix in the Dc domain of each FlgB subunit (hereafter called the FlgB Dc loop) binds to the inner surface of the upper β3-β4 region of the β-collar subring of the MS ring ( Figures 7 G and 7I). The N-terminal α1 helices of the six FliE subunits of the proximal rod lie down and bind horizontally to the inner surface of the lower β2/β5 region of the β-collar subring ( Figures 7 G and 7J). The interface between the FlgB Dc loop and the β-collar subring covers three β3/β4 pairs of the MS ring and includes residues R294, S295, Q297, N365, and E367 of FliF ( Figure 7 I). The interactions of the FliE α1 helix with the MS ring cover four β2/β5 pairs. The hydrophobic and polar residues E276, T278, E280, R370, I372, and H374 are involved in the interactions ( Figure 7 J). Because of the low resolution, the MS ring-interacting residues in the FlgB Dc loop and FliE α1 helix were not determined. The interactions of FlgB and FliE subunits with the MS ring suggest that FlgB and FliE, not just FliE ( Müller et al., 1992 43. Müller, V. ∙ Jones, C.J. ∙ Kawagishi, I. ... Characterization of the fliE genes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and identification of the FliE protein as a component of the flagellar hook-basal body complex J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174 :2298-2304 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), are adaptors of the rod to the MS ring. The planar arrangements of the FlgB Dc linking loop and the FliE α1 helix regulate adaptation of the rod to the ring structure of the MS ring, whereas the axial distribution of the L1 and L2 peptides changes the rod-surrounding pattern of the MS ring to the axial rod-interacting pattern. Thus, the extensive interactions of the L1 and L2 peptides with the rod and those of the FlgB Dc linking loop and FliE α1 helix with the MS ring realize planar-to-axial torque transmission and overcome the mismatch between the rotational symmetry of the MS ring and the helical symmetry of the rod.

Section: Discussion

How the flagellar motor is assembled and carries out torque transmission is a long-standing question. Our structure reveals that the rod proteins make extensive intersubunit interactions via their distinctive structural elements and form a compacted structure with high rigidity for the rod to mediate torque reception from the MS ring and torque transmission to the hook. The LP ring-rod and MS ring-rod interactions subtly mediate rotation and torque transmission in the motor. The LP ring has been proposed to be assembled after formation of the rod ( Chevance et al., 2007 11. Chevance, F.F. ∙ Takahashi, N. ∙ Karlinsey, J.E. ...

Nanoscale-length control of the flagellar driveshaft requires hitting the tethered outer membrane Science. 2017; 356 :197-200 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cohen and Hughes, 2014 12.

Bacteriol. 2014; 196 :2387-2395 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, deletion of the flgH or flgI genes severely affected formation of the rod ( Chevance et al., 2007 11. Chevance, F.F. ∙ Takahashi, N. ∙ Karlinsey, J.E. ... The mechanism of outer membrane penetration by the eubacterial flagellum and implications for spirochete evolution Genes Dev. 2007; 21 :2326-2335 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cohen and Hughes, 2014 12.

Components of the Salmonella flagellar export apparatus and classification of export substrates J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 :1388-1394 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki and Komeda, 1981 57. Suzuki, T. ∙ Komeda, Y. Incomplete flagellar structures in Escherichia coli mutants J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145 :1036-1041 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which suggests that the LP ring is crucial for assembly of the rod. The interactions of the LP ring with the distal rod suggest that the LP ring assembly might be coupled with that of the distal rod.
Although the flagellum has been proposed to be the evolutionary ancestor of T3SSs, the structure of the flagellar motor is significantly different from that of the T3SS basal body ( Figure S7 I). The rod in the basal body of the Salmonella T3SS consists of two proteins, PrgJ and PrgI, and adopts a relatively simple helical structure. In contrast to the tight contacts of the T3SS rod with the secretin channel and the inner membrane ring, the flagellar rod has few contacts with the LP ring to facilitate its high-speed rotation and torque transmission. In addition, unlike the C24-symmetric inner membrane ring assembled by PrgH and PrgK in the Salmonella T3SS, the MS ring of the flagellar motor is composed of 34 FliF subunits with mixed internal symmetries. Therefore, the flagellar motor has evolved special structural elements for bacterial motility.
The flagellar motor is a rotary engine for torsional force transmission to enable bacterial motility. In contrast, the rotation of F/V-type ATPases, another type of natural rotational machinery ( Kühlbrandt, 2019 35. Kühlbrandt, W. Structure and Mechanisms of F-Type ATP Synthases Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88 :515-549 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ), transmits torque force to induce conformational changes of the enzymatic domain for ATP synthesis or hydrolysis. The torque transmission mechanism from the rotary ring structure to the axial rod in the flagellar motor ( Figure S7 J) is different from that utilized by F/V-ATPases, in which the membrane-bound rotary ring forms a perpendicular surface attachment with the central stalk via salt bridges for planar-to-axial torsional force transmission. Thus, this work presents the structural basis for assembly and torque transmission of the flagellar motor and indicates the diversity of torque transmission mechanisms of natural rotary protein machineries.
Although this study determined the structure of the motor-hook complex, there are some limitations. First, mutagenetic analyses of the interacting residues need to be performed in vivo . Second, the sequence of the L2 peptide of the MS ring needs to be verified experimentally. Finally, the structures of the C ring, the C ring-stator interface, and the MS-C ring interactions need to be investigated further.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (ATCC 700720) WT and Δ fliCD strains were grown in 2YT or Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with streptomycin ( 10 μg/ml ) at 37°C. Escherichia coli SM10 λπ was grown in 2YT medium.
The in-frame deletion for both fliC and fliD genes in Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2 strain was constructed by homologous recombination by using the pDM4 suicide vector. The DNA fragments containing 1000 basepairs of the upstream sequence of fliC and 1000 basepairs of the downstream sequence of fliD were ligated into the pDM4 vector. The ligated plasmid was then transformed into the donor E. coli SM10 λπ strain. The transformed E . coli SM10 λπ strain and the recipient wild-type S . enterica LT2 strain were cultured in 2YT medium at 37°C until the value of OD 600 reached 0.6. The two strains were then mixed at a ratio of 1:1, and transferred onto a sterilized 0.22 μm membrane filter on 2YT agar plates without antibiotics at 30°C for mating overnight. Transconjugants were selected on 2YT agar plates containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The first recombinant colonies were confirmed by standard PCR with the 5′ and 3′ primers of sacB and fliFG genes, and grown on 2YT agar plates (without NaCl) supplemented with 6% sucrose in order to isolate the Δ fliCD mutant strains. Finally, the mutant strains were confirmed by standard PCR method using at least two different pairs of primers and further validated by DNA sequencing of the PCR products.
The ΔfliCD strain was initially cultured in 5 mL 2YT liquid medium supplemented with streptomycin (10 μg/ml) at 37°C overnight. Then 1 mL of the cultured bacteria was transferred into 1 L LB broth supplemented with streptomycin. After grown for 6.5 h at 37°C, the cultured bacteria were harvested and resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 500 mM sucrose and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, and incubated for 40 min on a shaker. Next, cells were further lysed by adding 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10 mM MgSO 4 at 4°C for 10 min while stirring gently. The lysates were then added into the same volume of the mixed lysis buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 500 mM sucrose, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10 mM MgSO 4 , and further stirred in order to reduce the viscosity of the resulting solution. After incubation for 1 h, the cell debris were removed by the low-speed centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The pH value of the supernatant of the cell lysates was then adjusted to pH 11.0 by using 5 M NaOH stock solution. Denatured proteins in the cell lysates were next removed by the low-speed centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to high-speed centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 1 h. After centrifugation, the pellets were harvested and resuspended in 50 mL of the buffer containing 100 mM KCl, 300 mM sucrose, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 11.0, adjusted with 1M KOH) and homogenized gently with a Dounce homogenizer (7 mL Tissue Grinder, Dounce, #357542). The homogenates were gently mixed on a shaker for 1 h at 4°C for complete resuspension. After low-speed centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant of the homogenates was collected and subjected to high-speed centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 1h in order to enrich the motor-hook complex particles in the pellets. The pellets were then resuspended in 4 mL of TET buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The CsCl powder (1.5 g) was subsequently added to the solution. Following addition of CsCl, the sample was diluted by adding the TET buffer to the final volume of 5 ml, and then loaded into the SW41 tubes for centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 12 hours. The fractions containing the motor-hook complex at the bottom of the tubes were collected by drop collections (6 drops per tube) and validated by 15% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining. The samples were dialyzed for three times in the TET buffer at 4°C to remove CsCl in the solution. After dialysis, the motor-hook complex sample was collected (the dataset I) for cryo-EM analysis.
We also developed another method to purify the motor-hook complex. In brief, the detergent LDAO instead of Triton X-100 was added to the cell mixture at the final concentration of 1% (v/v) after the lysozyme digestion. The cell debris were removed by low-speed centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. After the following high-speed centrifugation at 40,000 rpm, the pellets were resuspended with the buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 0.5% LDAO. The CsCl powder was then added to the sample. After centrifugation at the speed of 25,000 rpm for 16-18 h, the fractions containing the motor-hook complex were subjected to the Superose 6 10/300 GL column in the buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 0.5% LDAO. The fractions of the motor-hook complex were collected for cryo-EM analysis of the dataset II.
For negative staining, 3 μL of the motor-hook complex samples was loaded onto a glow-discharged carton grid (200 mesh) and stained with 2% Uranyl Acetate (UA). The prepared grids were examined using a transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV (Tecnai G2 Spirit, FEI).
For cryo-EM data collection, 2.5 μL of the motor-hook complex samples were loaded onto a glow-discharged Quantifoil carbon grid supported with graphene-oxide (300 mesh, R1.2/1.3). The samples were blotted by using an FEI Vitrobot at 100% humidity and 22°C for 6 s, and then submerged in liquid ethane by plunge-freezing. Cryo-EM images of the motor-hook complex were recorded on an FEI Titan Krios electron microscope operated at 300 kV with a nominal magnification of 22,500. Before data collection, the microscope was carefully aligned. Especially the coma-free alignment was performed to minimize the effects of beam tilt. Using serialEM software ( Mastronarde, 2005 38. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ), a total of 3,683 movies for the dataset I and 6,209 movies for the dataset II were recorded on a Gatan K2 summit camera at 4 frames/sec for 8 s with the super-resolution mode. The dose rate of the electron beam was set to ∼10 e - /s per physical pixel, resulting in a total electron dose of ∼47 electrons/Å 2 on the specimen with the calibrated pixel size of 0.6535 Å/pixel at the super-resolution mode. The nominal defocus values were set from 1.3 to 1.8 μm.
The drift correction and dose-weighting of all image stacks were performed with the MotionCor2 software ( Zheng et al., 2017 64. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate 2x binned images with a pixel size of 1.307 Å/pixel. Using RELION ( Scheres, 2012 49. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ), ∼1,000 particles were manually picked, followed by a two-dimensional (2D) classification to generate a class average of the motor-hook complex as a template for particle auto-picking. Unless specified, all following image processing steps were performed with cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 46. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4029) PubMed Google Scholar ). The motion-corrected micrographs of the two datasets were individually imported into cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 46. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4029) PubMed Google Scholar ), and defocus values of the micrographs were accomplished.
The dataset I in which the MS ring is well preserved was selected to determine the density maps of the whole motor-hook complex and the MS ring. A total of 478,027 motor-hook complex particles were picked with a box size of 512 × 512 based on the template-picking. A subset of 61,875 particles was selected in 2D classification. A subset of 52,714 particles was produced in ab-initio 3D reconstruction and 3D hetero-refinements. After several rounds of 3D refinements, two rounds of CTF refinements and a round of local refinement with the mask of the whole motor-hook complex with C1 symmetry, an average 3.9 Å-resolution density map of the whole motor-hook complex was obtained. Local refinements of the MS ring with the embraced proximal rod and the export apparatus with C1 symmetry produced a 4.5 Å-resolution high-quality density map. Local refinements on the rod with the partial hook and the export apparatus along the rod axis produced a 3.7 Å-resolution density map. The density map of the MS ring clearly showed that the MS ring has a 34-fold symmetry in the β-collar and RBM3 subrings and a 23-fold symmetry in the bottom inner RBM2 subring. For further local refinements of the MS ring, 433,479 particles that were centered on the MS ring were picked with the 380 × 380 box size. The 2D classification resulted in a subset of 56,346 particles. After ab-initio 3D reconstruction, a subset of 45,830 particles was subjected to 3D hetero-refinements by C34 symmetry with the mask of the β-collar and RBM3 subrings, which improved the resolution of the MS ring to 3.6 Å.
We combined the cryo-EM datasets I and II for high-resolution local refinements of the LP ring, the part of the hook that binds to the distal rod, the rod and the export apparatus. 1,879,357 raw particles were automatically picked using template-based picking with a box size of 512 × 512. The local defocus and astigmatism values of each raw particle were determined. Initial particle screening using 2D classification resulted in 167,090 particles, and further screenings by three-dimensional 3D hetero-refinements produced 148,517 particles without a mask. The volume of the motor-hook complex was obtained using a subset of 102,044 particles and global refinement with C1 symmetry. To determine the symmetry of the LP ring, after 3D hetero-refinement, a subset of 38,414 particles was used to perform a C31 symmetry expansion using RELION ( Scheres, 2012 49. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local refinements were performed on these symmetry-expanded data using a mask of the LP ring generated with Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ). After four iterations of local refinements, the symmetry of the LP ring was eventually converged to the C26 symmetry with a resolution of 3.34 Å . Then the C26 symmetry was imposed to refine a dataset of 80,548 particles and generated a reconstruction at the resolution of 2.8 Å. For the hook (148,517 particles), the whole rod (102,044 particles), the distal rod (118,962 particles), the proximal rod (148,517 particles), and the export apparatus (148,517 particles), local refinements were performed with C1 symmetry and local masks at their corresponding positions. After several iterations of local refinements, the resolutions of the density maps of the hook, the whole rod, the distal rod, the proximal rod and the export apparatus in reconstructions reached the resolutions of 3.4 Å, 3.3 Å, 3.2 Å, 3.2 Å, and 3.6 Å, respectively. For symmetry expansion in RELION ( Scheres, 2012 49. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ), cryoSPARC parameter files were first converted to the RELION formation with the UCSF PYEM ( https://zenodo.org/record/3576630 ) . All map sharpening were accomplished automatically within cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 46. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4029) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The FlgH protomer (residues C22-M232) and the FlgI protomer (residues E20-I365) were built manually in the 2.8 Å-resolution density map of the LP ring in Coo t ( Emsley et al., 2010 16. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fatty-acylated residue Cys22 of FlgH was modeled as a S-Octanoyl-L-cysteine residue. The initial models of the FlgH and FlgI protomers were first refined individually in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). The LP ring model was then built in Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ) using C26 symmetry and the models of the FlgH and FlgI protomers, and refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) with non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints.
The protomers of FlgF (residues D2-M250), FlgC (residues A2-Q134), FlgB (residues L2-G136), FliE (residues S33-V104), FliF-L1 (residues G311-P331) and FliF-L2 (modeled as 15 alanine residues) were built de novo in the 3.2 Å-resolution density maps of the distal rod and proximal rod in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 16. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). The FlgG protomer was modeled based on the previously reported FlgG structural model (PDB: 6JZR ) ( Fujii et al., 2017 20. Fujii, T. ∙ Kato, T. ∙ Hiraoka, K.D. ... Identical folds used for distinct mechanical functions of the bacterial flagellar rod and hook Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14276 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). These protomers were individually refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model of the whole rod was generated in Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the helical parameters: an axial rise of 4.3 Å and an azimuthal rotation of 64.7° (hereafter named as the axial parameters) by using the refined protomer structures of the rod proteins in the 3.3 Å-resolution density map of the rod. In total, 24 FlgG subunits, 5 FlgF subunits, 6 FlgC subunits, 5 FlgB subunits, 5 FliF L1 peptides, 5 FliF L2 peptides, and 6 FliE subunits were modeled in the structure. The structure of the hook protein FlgE was modeled based on the reported FlgE structural model (PDB: 6K3I ) ( Shibata et al., 2019 51. Shibata, S. ∙ Matsunami, H. ∙ Aizawa, S.I. ... Torque transmission mechanism of the curved bacterial flagellar hook revealed by cryo-EM Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :941-945 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). 33 FlgE subunits were modeled using the axial parameters in the 3.4 Å-density map of the hook in Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model of the proximal 11 FlgE subunits was carefully modeled within the 3.3 Å-resolution density map of the rod, and combined with the model of the rod for the refinement in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). The other 22 FlgE subunits were modeled and refined in the 3.4 Å-resolution density map of the hook. The model of the export apparatus was built in its 3.6 Å-resolution density map according to the previously reported structure of the FliP 5 R 1 Q 4 complex (FliP 5 R 1 Q 4 , PDB: 6F2D ) ( Kuhlen et al., 2018 36. Kuhlen, L. ∙ Abrusci, P. ∙ Johnson, S. ... Structure of the core of the type III secretion system export apparatus Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :583-590 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was first refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) without NCS restraints. The models of the rod and the export apparatus were then fitted into in the 3.7 Å-resolution density map of the rod and and refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) without NCS restraints.
The structure of the MS ring containing 34 FliF subunits was modeled by using the structures of the β-collar and RBM3 domains from the rod-free MS ring (PDB: 6SCN ) ( Johnson et al., 2020 27. Johnson, S. ∙ Fong, Y.H. ∙ Deme, J.C. ... Symmetry mismatch in the MS-ring of the bacterial flagellar rotor explains the structural coordination of secretion and rotation Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :966-975 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) with C34 symmetry in the 3.6 Å-resolution density map of the MS ring obtained in local refinements. The model was refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) with NCS restraints. The initial structural model of the inner RBM2 subring was manually built using the structural model of the RBM2 domain of the rod-free MS ring with C23 symmetry in the 4.5 Å-resolution density map of the MS ring in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 16. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model of the inner RBM2 subring was refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) without NCS restraints.
The structural models of the LP ring, the hook, the rod with a part of the hook (3.3 Å), the rod with the export apparatus (3.7 Å), the MS ring (β-collar and RBM3 subrings) and the RBM2 subring of the MS ring were checked with Molprobity ( Williams et al., 2018 61. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: More and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2301) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model of the whole motor-hook complex was built by merging these refined models in the 3.9 Å-resolution density map of the whole motor-hook complex. The positions of the LP ring and the MS ring in the motor-hook complex were accurately determined according to a locally refined map of the LP ring with the surrounded distal rod, the locally refined 4.5 Å-resolution map of the MS ring with the surrounded proximal rod and export apparatus, and the globally refined 3.9 Å-resolution map of the motor-hook complex. The structure of the motor-hook complex was checked with Molprobity ( Williams et al., 2018 61. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: More and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2301) PubMed Google Scholar ). The statistics of the cryo-EM data collection, processing, model refinement and validation were listed in Table S1 . All structural figures were prepared in UCSF ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 21. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2591) PubMed Google Scholar ), Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ), and PyMOL ( https://pymol.org/2/ ).
In Figure S1 and Table S1 , the tight and corrected Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curve raw data were calculated using a tight mask alone and a tight mask with correction by noise substitution, respectively, with two independent half-maps in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 46. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4029) PubMed Google Scholar ), and illustrated with Graphpad prism 7.0 ( https://www.graphpad.com:443/ ). The resolution estimations of cryo-EM density maps were based on the corrected FSC curves at the FSC = 0.143 criterion ( Chen et al., 2013 10. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 47.

Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model resolutions were evaluated using phenix.mtriage ( Afonine et al., 2018 2. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Klaholz, B.P. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... New tools for the analysis and validation of cryo-EM maps and atomic models Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :814-840 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the model-based noise free and experimental maps at the FSC = 0.5 criterion. The local resolutions were determined using ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 34. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1314) PubMed Google Scholar ) with two independent half-maps.
