Title: Scap structures highlight key role for rotation of intertwined luminal loops in cholesterol sensing


Abstract: Summary

The cholesterol-sensing protein Scap induces cholesterol synthesis by transporting membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus for proteolytic activation. Transport requires interaction between Scap’s two ER luminal loops (L1 and L7), which flank an intramembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD). Cholesterol inhibits Scap transport by binding to L1, which triggers Scap’s binding to Insig, an ER retention protein. Here we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate two structures of full-length chicken Scap: (1) a wild-type free of Insigs and (2) mutant Scap bound to chicken Insig without cholesterol. Strikingly, L1 and L7 intertwine tightly to form a globular domain that acts as a luminal platform connecting the SSD to the rest of Scap. In the presence of Insig, this platform undergoes a large rotation accompanied by rearrangement of Scap’s transmembrane helices. We postulate that this conformational change halts Scap transport of SREBPs and inhibits cholesterol synthesis.

Section: Introduction

Scap is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that controls synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids in animal cells. This control is exerted by binding of Scap to membrane-bound transcription factors called SREBPs (sterol regulatory element-binding proteins) ( Brown et al., 2018 5. Brown, M.S. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Retrospective on Cholesterol Homeostasis: The Central Role of Scap Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :783-807 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). When cellular cholesterol levels are low, Scap transports SREBPs to the Golgi apparatus, where their transcriptionally active portions are released proteolytically from the membrane to enter the nucleus. When in the nucleus, SREBPs activate all genes necessary for cholesterol synthesis and uptake from low-density lipoprotein (LDL) ( Horton et al., 2002 17. Horton, J.D. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. ∙ Brown, M.S. SREBPs: activators of the complete program of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109 :1125-1131 Crossref Scopus (4126) PubMed Google Scholar ). When cholesterol accumulates in ER membranes, it binds to Scap, triggering a conformational change that promotes Scap’s interaction with either one of two ER membrane retention proteins, Insig-1 or Insig-2 ( Yang et al., 2002 49. Yang, T. ∙ Espenshade, P.J. ∙ Wright, M.E. ...

USA. 2002; 99 :16672-16677 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a result, transport of the Scap/SREBP complex from the ER to the Golgi apparatus is reduced, and synthesis of cholesterol and uptake of LDL declines. This negative feedback mechanism ensures cholesterol homeostasis ( Radhakrishnan et al., 2008 37. Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. ∙ McDonald, J.G. ...

A detailed biochemical dissection of the hamster ortholog of Scap, carried out over the last 25 years, has led us to advance a working model for its cholesterol-sensing mechanism ( Brown and Goldstein, 1997 4.

Biochem. 2018; 87 :783-807 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). As shown in Figure 1 , the amino-terminal domain of Scap (amino acids 1–767) contains eight transmembrane (TM) helices separated by seven hydrophilic loops. The soluble, cytoplasm-facing, carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Scap (amino acids 768–1276) binds SREBPs. Scap’s cholesterol-sensing functions are properties of its amino-terminal membrane domain. This domain contains two large luminal loops: loop 1 (∼240 amino acids) and loop 7 (∼175 amino acids). Loop 1 (L1) binds cholesterol with the same affinity and specificity as the entire membrane domain ( Motamed et al., 2011 31. Motamed, M. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Wang, M.L. ...

USA. 2007; 104 :6511-6518 Crossref Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ). The segment containing TMs 2–6 is almost entirely buried in the membrane. Three different point mutations in this segment prevent Scap binding to Insig, defining this segment as the Insig-binding domain ( Yabe et al., 2002 46. Yabe, D. ∙ Xia, Z.-P. ∙ Adams, C.M. ...

USA. 2002; 99 :16672-16677 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). This domain shares sequence homology with at least six other polytopic membrane proteins that play important roles in handling cholesterol, including Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and Patched, and is designated the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) ( Hua et al., 1996a 18.

Cytosolic loop 6 (L6) contains a hexapeptide (MELADL) that serves as a binding site for the coat protein complex II (COPII), which clusters ER proteins into coated vesicles for transport to the Golgi apparatus ( Sun et al., 2005 42. Sun, L.-P. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. ... Insig required for sterol-mediated inhibition of Scap/SREBP binding to COPII proteins in vitro J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :26483-26490 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). The second large luminal loop, loop 7 (L7), exerts a regulatory function that depends on its binding to L1 ( Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, Y. ∙ Lee, K.M. ∙ Kinch, L.N. ... Direct demonstration that Loop1 of Scap binds to Loop7: A crucial event in cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :12888-12896 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our previous biochemical studies have provided evidence that L1 binding to L7 places Scap in an active conformation in which the MELADL sequence in L6 is accessible to COPII proteins, allowing Scap to escort SREBPs to the Golgi apparatus ( Yang et al., 2000 48. Yang, T. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. ∙ Brown, M.S. Overexpression of membrane domain of SCAP prevents sterols from inhibiting SCAP.SREBP exit from endoplasmic reticulum J. Biol.

Chem. 2013; 288 :14059-14067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Scanning mutagenesis revealed two tyrosine mutations (Y234A in L1 and Y640S in L7) that disrupted binding of L1 to L7 and blocked the ability of Scap to transport SREBPs to the Golgi apparatus ( Motamed et al., 2011 31.

Chem. 2013; 288 :14059-14067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, these two loop mutations locked Scap in its cholesterol-bound conformation even in the absence of cholesterol ( Gao et al., 2017 10. Gao, Y. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. ... Cholesterol-induced conformational changes in the sterol-sensing domain of the Scap protein suggest feedback mechanism to control cholesterol synthesis J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :8729-8737 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculated that binding of cholesterol to L1 may disrupt the interaction between L1 and L7, converting Scap to an inactive conformation where it binds Insig, which moves the MELADL sequence so that it is inaccessible to COPII proteins ( Brown et al., 2018 5. Brown, M.S. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Retrospective on Cholesterol Homeostasis: The Central Role of Scap Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :783-807 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cholesterol binding is not the sole means of converting Scap to an inactive conformation. Oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), also convert Scap to an Insig-binding conformation by binding not to Scap but to Insig ( Adams et al., 2004 1. Adams, C.M. ∙ Reitz, J. ∙ De Brabander, J.K. ... Cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol inhibit activation of SREBPs by different mechanisms, both involving SCAP and Insigs J. Biol.

Atomic-level structural insights into the molecular basis of Scap regulation are beginning to emerge. Yan et al. (2021) 47. Yan, R. ∙ Cao, P. ∙ Song, W. ...

Here we report the cryo-EM structure of a full-length, wild-type Scap free from Insigs or sterols. Our data obtained with the chicken ortholog of Scap (cScap) reveals that L1 and L7 intertwine to form a highly structured domain. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of a complex of chicken Insig-1 with a mutant cScap that binds Insigs in the absence of sterols. These two structures help clarify the role of the L1 and L7 ER luminal loops in controlling the conformation of Scap’s TM helices, regulating transport of SREBPs and assuring cholesterol homeostasis at the level of the cell and the whole organism.

Section: Results

In generating preparations of purified Scap suitable for cryo-EM, we were forced to overcome several obstacles in biochemical purification and cryo-EM imaging. To circumvent the relatively poor behavior of full-length mammalian Scap upon detergent solubilization, we screened 10 vertebrate orthologs and found that full-length cScap had the best biochemical stability after purification. cScap shares high homology with its mammalian counterparts (>75% overall identity, >80% for the membrane domain), including all residues that have been determined to have functional significance ( Figure S1 A). We tested the function of cScap in multiple assays. We first checked whether cScap could transport human SREBP2 in sterol-depleted, Scap-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, an assay we routinely utilize to characterize Scap constructs. When human SREBP2 was transfected into these cells, its precursor form was barely detectable, and no cleaved nuclear form was detected ( Figure S1 B, lane 2). We have shown previously that SREBPs are degraded rapidly in the absence of Scap ( Rawson et al., 1999 38. Rawson, R.B. ∙ DeBose-Boyd, R. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. ... Failure to cleave sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) causes cholesterol auxotrophy in Chinese hamster ovary cells with genetic absence of SREBP cleavage-activating protein J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :28549-28556 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon co-transfection of wild-type cScap, we observed a marked increase in the amount of the SREBP2 precursor form ( Figure S1 B, lane 3), indicating that human SREBP2 could bind cScap. Moreover, we also detected a significant amount of the cleaved nuclear form, indicating that cScap transports human SREBP2 for processing. We have shown previously that a point mutation in the intramembrane SSD of hamster Scap (D428A) renders Scap in a configuration that binds Insig in the absence of sterols and abolishes Scap transport of SREBPs ( Feramisco et al., 2005 9. Feramisco, J.D. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Ikeda, Y. ... Intramembrane aspartic acid in SCAP protein governs cholesterol-induced conformational change Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :3242-3247 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). The analogous residue in cScap is D435. When we mutated D435 to valine, cScap continued to stabilize human SREBP2, but it no longer transported SREBP2 to the Golgi apparatus for processing ( Figure S1 B, lane 4).
To directly demonstrate binding of cScap to human SREBP2, we used two different assays. In the first assay, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with human SREBP2 and human Scap or cScap. To enhance detection of the precursor form of human SREBP2, we introduced mutations that disrupt the 3 known cleavage sites on this protein ( Hua et al., 1996b 19. Hua, X. ∙ Sakai, J. ∙ Brown, M.S. ... Regulated cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding proteins requires sequences on both sides of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane J. Biol.

Cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by CPP32 during apoptosis EMBO J. 1996; 15 :1012-1020 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant cScaps bound to cleavage-resistant SREBP2 to a degree similar to human Scap ( Figure S1 C, lanes 3–5). In the second assay, using a system we described previously ( Kober et al., 2020 22. Kober, D.L. ∙ Xu, S. ∙ Li, S. ... Identification of a degradation signal at the carboxy terminus of SREBP2: A new role for this domain in cholesterol homeostasis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :28080-28091 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), we expressed the CTDs ( Figure S1 D) of cScap and human SREBP2 in Sf9 insect cells and showed that these domains co-purified as a stable soluble complex ( Figure S1 E). These studies indicate that cScap interacts with human SREBPs and transports them to the Golgi apparatus in a manner similar to mammalian Scap.
Preliminary cryo-EM data on purified cScap did not result in useful 3D reconstructions. To improve resolution, we sought to obtain a Fab fragment that would aid with single particle alignment. We generated and screened over 2,500 hybridoma clones for antibodies that would bind folded cScap but not denatured polypeptide ( Figures S2 A–S2F; STAR Methods ). We identified a single antibody, immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4G10, that aided with cryo-EM analysis. The Fab fragment derived from IgG 4G10 (sequence in Figure S2 C), hereafter designated 4G10 Fab , co-purifies with cScap in glyco-diosgenin (GDN) micelles ( Figure 2 A), and we prepared grids of this complex for cryo-EM imaging ( Figure 2 A; STAR Methods ). To determine whether 4G10 Fab interacted with the luminal or cytoplasmic domain of cScap, we prepared a plasmid encoding a protein representing the ER luminal portion of cScap. This plasmid encoded L1 of cScap, followed by L7 of cScap, separated by a 15-amino acid (aa) linker, and was preceded by a signal sequence from honeybee mellitin. When overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells, the resulting recombinant protein, hereafter referred to as cScap(L1-L7), was secreted as a soluble protein. An analogous result has been observed previously for a fusion protein combining L1 and L7 of hamster Scap ( Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, Y. ∙ Lee, K.M. ∙ Kinch, L.N. ... Direct demonstration that Loop1 of Scap binds to Loop7: A crucial event in cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :12888-12896 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), further underscoring the similarities between cScap and mammalian Scap. We demonstrated that 4G10 Fab efficiently binds this soluble cScap(L1-L7) fusion protein ( Figure 2 B), indicating that the antibody fragment interacts with cScap’s luminal loops independent of the presence of the TM helices. Finally, we carried out sterol binding studies as developed previously ( Motamed et al., 2011 31. Motamed, M. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Wang, M.L. ...

USA. 2007; 104 :6511-6518 Crossref Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ). Purified cScap in lauryl maltoside neopentyl glycol (LMNG) detergent showed saturable binding to [ 3 H]cholesterol (half-maximal at ∼75 nM) but no significant binding to [ 3 H]25-HC or [ 3 H]lanosterol ( Figure 2 C). In competition assays, binding of [ 3 H]cholesterol was reduced by increasing amounts of unlabeled cholesterol but not by unlabeled 25-HC or lanosterol ( Figure 2 D). These cScap binding data are consistent with our previous data on mammalian Scap’s sterol binding affinity and specificity ( Radhakrishnan et al., 2007 36. Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Ikeda, Y. ∙ Kwon, H.J. ... Sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: oxysterols block transport by binding to Insig Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To elucidate the structure of cScap in its cholesterol-free form, in which it transports SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, we collected single-particle cryo-EM data for cScap/4G10 Fab on a Titan Krios microscope ( Figure S3 ). An initial dataset of over 10,000 micrographs and 9 million particles was subjected to extensive 2D and 3D classification to identify subsets for the different reconstructions reported here ( STAR Methods ). Fortunately, the 4G10 Fab provides a fiducial marker that drives alignment of particles during classification ( Figure S3 ). The overall reconstruction of cScap/4G10 Fab in GDN detergent micelles shows a clearly delineated Fab fragment ( Figure 2 E). The maps show that 4G10 Fab binds to the ER luminal L1-L7 domain that projects away from the micelle. Global refinement of the best 3D class containing 223K particles resulted in a reconstruction with an overall resolution of 3.0 Å ( Figure S3 F). The L1-L7 region and the antigen binding region of 4G10 Fab have the highest local resolution in the structure ( Figure S3 C). Focused refinement resulted in a 2.9-Å-resolution map that permitted de novo model building ( Figure S3 D). 3D classification focused on the micellar and CTD regions resulted in reconstruction at 4.1-Å resolution ( Figure S3 F). The data revealed density for six TM α helices and a large feature on the cytosolic face that has a clear WD domain shape identifying it as the CTD (see below). Although we could not build a de novo atomic model for these regions, we were able to create a backbone model for TM1, TM3–TM6, and TM8 of cScap, starting with rigid-body fitting of TM1–TM6 of the related NPC1 protein ( Li et al., 2016b 26. Li, X. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Coutavas, E. ... Structure of human Niemann-Pick C1 protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :8212-8217 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cryo-EM data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table S1 .
The high-resolution focused cryo-EM map for cScap L1-L7 with our refined atomic model is shown in Figure 3 A, and representative densities for segments of the protein with different secondary structure are shown in Figure S4 A. The loops bind together to form an oblong globular structure that measures 60 Å along its long axis (roughly parallel to the plane of the membrane) and extends ∼40 Å away from the surface of the GDN micelle ( Figure 2 E). Model building and register assignment for L1-L7 was facilitated by clear density for a previously described N-linked glycan modification on an asparagine residue of L7 that is preceded by two tyrosine residues ( Nohturfft et al., 1998a 32. Nohturfft, A. ∙ Brown, M.S. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Topology of SREBP cleavage-activating protein, a polytopic membrane protein with a sterol-sensing domain J. Biol.

Direct demonstration that Loop1 of Scap binds to Loop7: A crucial event in cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :12888-12896 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The folded luminal loop structure contains L1 residues 53–278 and L7 residues 636–704. Compared with typical protein-protein interactions, the interface between the loops is extensive, burying 3,760 Å 2 of surface area. An N-terminal stretch of L7 residues (ending at the glycosylation site N667) fits into a ridge facing the micelle, and a C-terminal stretch folds back to form part of the central core β sheet ( Figure 3 A, magenta). A search using the DALI server ( Holm, 2020 16. Holm, L. DALI and the persistence of protein shape Protein Sci. 2020; 29 :128-140 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that the L1-L7 domain of cScap bears structural homology to the middle luminal domain (MLD) of NPC1 ( Li et al., 2016a 25. Li, X. ∙ Saha, P. ∙ Li, J. ... Clues to the mechanism of cholesterol transfer from the structure of NPC1 middle lumenal domain bound to NPC2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :10079-10084 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ), an integral protein in the lysosomal membrane that transports LDL-derived cholesterol ( Infante et al., 2008a 20. Infante, R.E. ∙ Abi-Mosleh, L. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ... Purified NPC1 protein. I. Binding of cholesterol and oxysterols to a 1278-amino acid membrane protein J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :1052-1063 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ; 2008b 21. Infante, R.E. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Abi-Mosleh, L. ... Purified NPC1 protein: II. Localization of sterol binding to a 240-amino acid soluble luminal loop J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :1064-1075 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 B). The topology of the cScap luminal domain is distinctive from the NPC1 MLD in that cScap’s L7 contributes a parallel β strand to the core β sheet (yellow star in Figure S4 B) and adds several short α helices surrounding this core. The result of this topological arrangement is that L1 and L7 are tightly interdigitated.
Because our high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions could be obtained only when the 4G10 Fab is bound, it is formally possible that binding of the Fab altered the cScap structure. In our cryo-EM reconstruction of cScap, 4G10 Fab binds to a region of L1 away from the micelle and makes no interactions with L7 ( Figure S5 A). To test whether the Fab binding affects the activity of cScap, we mutated the cScap residues that contact the Fab to produce a version of cScap that does not bind the Fab. The 4G10 Fab interaction is largely mediated by polar contacts, including from residues R135 and D136 to oppositely charged surfaces on the Fab. We produced a charge-swap mutant of these residues (cScap R135E/D136K ). This charge-swap mutant lost its ability to interact with 4G10 Fab , as judged by immunoprecipitation ( Figures S5 B and S5C). This alteration of L1 at the Fab binding site did not affect the ability of cScap R135E/D136K to transport SREBP2 in cholesterol-depleted, Scap-deficient cells ( Figure S5 D, lanes 2 and 3). These results suggest that 4G10 Fab binds to a site on cScap that is not important for cScap function and that binding to this site is unlikely to alter cScap structure.
The highly structured nature of the L1-L7 domain agrees with our previous data showing that co-expression of separate hamster Scap L1 and L7 polypeptides or fusion of L7 to the end of L1 (as described above) results in a stable, water-soluble protein ( Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, Y. ∙ Lee, K.M. ∙ Kinch, L.N. ... Direct demonstration that Loop1 of Scap binds to Loop7: A crucial event in cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :12888-12896 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). The specific interactions seen in our L1-L7 structure agree well with previous alanine scanning mutagenesis studies carried out with hamster Scap, which identified residues Y234 and Y640 (chicken Y666), whose mutation disrupted the interaction between L1 and L7, leading to ER retention of Scap and blocking transport and activation of SREBP2 ( Motamed et al., 2011 31. Motamed, M. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Wang, M.L. ... Identification of luminal Loop 1 of Scap protein as the sterol sensor that maintains cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :18002-18012 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2013 51. Zhang, Y. ∙ Motamed, M. ∙ Seemann, J. ...

Chem. 2013; 288 :14059-14067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 B).
To further interrogate the interaction between L1 and L7, we designed seven additional mutations in hamster Scap (to alanine, glutamate, or tryptophan) that our structure predicted would disrupt the packing between L1 and L7 ( Figures 3 B–3E): Q94E, I96A, L125W, V150W, L170E, L636W (L662 in cScap), and I655A (I681 in cScap). We also made two mutations of surface residues away from the L1-L7 interface ( Figure S5 A): R135W and K246W (R246 in cScap). We then tested the function of all of these mutant Scaps in SREBP2 cleavage assays. We transfected Scap-deficient cells with human SREBP2 without or with hamster Scap. In the absence of transfected Scap, SREBP2 was barely detected ( Figure 3 F, lane 2). When hamster Scap was coexpressed, the levels of the SREBP2 precursor were increased greatly, and the cleaved nuclear form was detected ( Figure 3 F, lane 3). As reported previously ( Motamed et al., 2011 31. Motamed, M. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Wang, M.L. ... Identification of luminal Loop 1 of Scap protein as the sterol sensor that maintains cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :18002-18012 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2013 51. Zhang, Y. ∙ Motamed, M. ∙ Seemann, J. ...

Chem. 2013; 288 :14059-14067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), the Y234A and Y640S mutants stabilized the SREBP2 precursor similar to the wild-type, but they did not mediate SREBP2 cleavage ( Figure 3 F, lanes 4 and 5). All seven mutations designed to disrupt the L1-L7 structure stabilized the SREBP2 precursor but did not promote SREBP2 cleavage ( Figure 3 F, lanes 6–12). The two surface mutations that were predicted to maintain the L1-L7 interaction stabilized the SREBP2 precursor and also promoted SREBP2 cleavage, similar to the wild-type ( Figure 3 F, lanes 13 and 14 compared with lane 3). These new mutagenesis data, together with previous studies ( Motamed et al., 2011 31. Motamed, M. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Wang, M.L. ... Identification of luminal Loop 1 of Scap protein as the sterol sensor that maintains cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :18002-18012 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2013 51. Zhang, Y. ∙ Motamed, M. ∙ Seemann, J. ...

Chem. 2013; 288 :14059-14067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), provide robust functional validation of the L1-L7 structural model.
The structure of L1-L7 revealed that two of L1’s three cysteines, C147 and C169, are engaged in a disulfide bond with clear density in the 2.9-Å map ( Figure S5 E). To further validate our molecular model for this domain, we assayed a hamster Scap(L1-L7) fusion protein that is secreted from CHO-K1 cells ( Figure S5 F), as described above ( Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, Y. ∙ Lee, K.M. ∙ Kinch, L.N. ... Direct demonstration that Loop1 of Scap binds to Loop7: A crucial event in cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :12888-12896 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). This hamster protein contains three cysteines, all in L1, and all of which are conserved in cScap. We mutated each cysteine to alanine or serine. After transfection into CHO-K1 cells, we tested the cell lysate and the medium for non-secreted and secreted forms of L1-L7, respectively. As shown in Figure S5 G, lane 7, wild-type L1-L7 containing all 3 cysteines (CCC) was secreted. Replacement of cysteine 147 with alanine (ACC) or cysteine 169 with serine (CSC) abolished secretion ( Figure S5 G, lanes 8 and 9), but replacing cysteine 264 with alanine (CCA) did not affect secretion ( Figure S5 G, lane 10). We then used methoxy poly-(ethylene glycol) maleimide 5000 (mPEG-MAL-5000), a high-molecular-weight thiol-reactive reagent that forms covalent bonds with free cysteines, to determine whether cysteines existed in the reduced state. At least one of the cysteines in wild-type L1-L7 was accessible to mPEG-MAL-5000 ( Figure S5 G, lanes 7 and 11), whereas neither of the two cysteines on mutant L1-L7 (CCA) were accessible to mPEG-MAL-5000 ( Figure S5 G, lanes 10 and 14). After denaturation by heating and disulfide bond reduction with dithiothreitol, one or both of the previously inaccessible cysteines in L1-L7 (CCA) could be modified by mPEG-MAL-5000 ( Figure S5 H).
If this disulfide bond is also necessary for the function of full-length Scap in cells, then we would expect mutation of either of these cysteines to disrupt Scap’s ability to transport SREBP2. To answer this question, we individually mutated the three L1 cysteines to alanine or serine in full-length hamster Scap and tested these mutants in our SREBP2 cleavage assay. As expected, when transfected into Scap-deficient cells and after sterol depletion, wild-type Scap stabilized the SREBP2 precursor and triggered SREBP2 processing ( Figure S5 I, lanes 2 and 3). Mutation of either cysteine in the observed disulfide bond (C147A or C169S) did not affect Scap’s ability to stabilize the SREBP2 precursor but markedly reduced Scap’s ability to trigger SREBP2 processing ( Figure S5 I, lanes 4 and 5). Mutation of the unpaired cysteine (C264A) produced a Scap protein that behaved similarly as wild-type Scap ( Figure S5 I, lane 6). These results validate our L1-L7 model and show the requirement of this disulfide bond for Scap’s transport of SREBP2.
We next sought to characterize how Insig binding changes the conformation of Scap. To determine the structure of Insig-bound Scap, we used the cScap D435V mutation (described above), which causes Scap to interact with Insig in the absence of sterols. We tested the function of cScap D435V in multiple assays. As shown above, cScap D435V binds to human SREBP2 ( Figure S1 C, lane 5) and stabilizes its precursor form to a similar extent as cScap ( Figure S1 B, lanes 2–4). Unlike with wild-type cScap, we detected no cleaved nuclear form of SREBP2 with cScap D435V , indicating that this mutant was retained in the ER, similar to what has been observed for hamster Scap(D428A).
We then tested whether chicken Insig-1 with its first 27 residues deleted (cInsig-1) would interact with cScap. In the absence of cInsig-1 and when cScap was overexpressed, cScap mediated transport and cleavage of human SREBP2 even in the presence of sterols ( Figure S1 F, lane 3). However, when cInsig-1 was overexpressed together with the overexpressed cScap, cleavage of SREBP2 was blocked ( Figure S1 F, lane 4). These data are consistent with cInsig-1 interacting with cScap under conditions of sterol excess, akin to mammalian Insigs interacting with mammalian Scap ( Yang et al., 2002 49. Yang, T. ∙ Espenshade, P.J. ∙ Wright, M.E. ... Crucial step in cholesterol homeostasis: sterols promote binding of SCAP to INSIG-1, a membrane protein that facilitates retention of SREBPs in ER Cell. 2002; 110 :489-500 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (834) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Having established the functional similarity of cScap and cInsig-1 to their mammalian counterparts, we proceeded to purify a stable complex of FLAG-tagged full-length cScap D435V and untagged cInsig-1 co-expressed in HEK293s GnTI − cells. As with the cScap protein, this complex bound efficiently to 4G10 Fab ( Figure 4 A), and we used this ternary complex for cryo-EM studies ( Figure S6 ). We also measured the sterol binding activity of the cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex in LMNG detergent, using similar assays as described above for cScap. Consistent with the presence of Scap and Insig in the binding reaction, we detected saturable binding of [ 3 H]cholesterol (half-maximal at ∼75 nM) and [ 3 H]25-HC (half-maximal at ∼100 nM) ( Figure 4 B). No binding was observed for [ 3 H]Lanosterol. We consistently observed that the maximal binding of [ 3 H]cholesterol was approximately 2-fold higher than that of [ 3 H]25-HC. We next conducted separate competition binding assays for bound [ 3 H]cholesterol and bound [ 3 H]25-HC. Binding of [ 3 H]cholesterol was inhibited by unlabeled cholesterol but not by unlabeled 25-HC or lanosterol ( Figure 4 C). Binding of [ 3 H]25-HC was inhibited by unlabeled 25-HC but not by unlabeled cholesterol or lanosterol ( Figure 4 D). In previous studies, we showed that purified hamster Scap binds cholesterol but not 25-HC ( Radhakrishnan et al., 2004 35. Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Sun, L.-P. ∙ Kwon, H.J. ... Direct binding of cholesterol to the purified membrane region of SCAP: mechanism for a sterol-sensing domain Mol. Cell. 2004; 15 :259-268 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas purified human Insig-2 binds 25-HC but not cholesterol ( Radhakrishnan et al., 2007 36. Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Ikeda, Y. ∙ Kwon, H.J. ... Sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: oxysterols block transport by binding to Insig Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :6511-6518 Crossref Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we demonstrate that this dual sterol specificity is retained in a purified complex containing cScap and cInsig-1.
We collected cryo-EM data for the cScap D435V /cInsig-1/4G10 Fab complex, which produced a global reconstruction with a resolution of 4.1 Å ( Figures S6 A–S6F). As with the cScap sample, 2D and 3D classification relied on 4G10 Fab for accurate particle alignment ( Figure S6 F). Focused classification on the L1-L7 domain produced a higher-resolution, 3.5-Å map ( Figure S6 D) that permitted de novo model building. 3D classification focused on the TM region resulted in a reconstruction at 4.6 Å resolution that revealed clear density for 4G10 Fab , L1-L7, and TM bundles for cScap D435V and cInsig-1 but lacked density for the CTD ( Figure 4 E). This map showed clear density for 12 TM α helices ( Figure S6 C). Based on this map, we created a backbone model for TM1–TM6 of cScap D435V and all six TMs of cInsig-1 ( Figure 5 A), starting with rigid-body fitting of homologous structures NPC1 TM1–TM6 ( Li et al., 2016b 26. Li, X. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Coutavas, E. ... Structure of human Niemann-Pick C1 protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :8212-8217 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mycobacterial Insig ( Ren et al., 2015 39. Ren, R. ∙ Zhou, X. ∙ He, Y. ... PROTEIN STRUCTURE. Crystal structure of a mycobacterial Insig homolog provides insight into how these sensors monitor sterol levels Science. 2015; 349 :187-191 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). TM7 and TM8 of cScap D435V are not visible in this map.
The interface between cScap D435V and cInsig-1 consists of TM2, TM4, and TM5 of cScap D435V and TM3 and TM4 of cInsig-1. We sought to interpret previous mutagenesis data for Scap and Insig ( Tables S2 and S3 ) in light of this structural model. The mutation Y298C in mammalian Scap prevents binding to Insigs and leads to constitutive trafficking of SREBP2 that cannot be blocked by sterols ( Nohturfft et al., 1998b 33. Nohturfft, A. ∙ Brown, M.S. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Sterols regulate processing of carbohydrate chains of wild-type SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), but not sterol-resistant mutants Y298C or D443N Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :12848-12853 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). This residue sits at the cytosolic end of TM2, poised for interaction with Insig’s TM3 ( Figure 5 A). Two other mutations, L315F ( Yabe et al., 2002 46. Yabe, D. ∙ Xia, Z.-P. ∙ Adams, C.M. ... Three mutations in sterol-sensing domain of SCAP block interaction with insig and render SREBP cleavage insensitive to sterols Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :16672-16677 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) and D443N ( Hua et al., 1996a 18. Hua, X. ∙ Nohturfft, A. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. ... Sterol resistance in CHO cells traced to point mutation in SREBP cleavage-activating protein Cell. 1996; 87 :415-426 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ), also abolish interaction with Insigs. These residues cluster at the cytosolic ends of TM3 and TM6 and may contribute to Insig binding through proper positioning of TM2 (see below).
Our structure may also explain how mutations in Insig affect binding to Scap ( Figure 5 B; Table S3 ). The mutations Q132A, W145A, and D149A in TM4 reduce the interaction of human Insig-2 with Scap without altering its binding to 25-HC ( Gong et al., 2006 14. Gong, Y. ∙ Lee, J.N. ∙ Brown, M.S. ... Juxtamembranous aspartic acid in Insig-1 and Insig-2 is required for cholesterol homeostasis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :6154-6159 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Radhakrishnan et al., 2007 36. Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Ikeda, Y. ∙ Kwon, H.J. ... Sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: oxysterols block transport by binding to Insig Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :6511-6518 Crossref Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ), implying that these mutations do not globally disrupt Insig’s fold. These residues are situated at the cScap D435V /cInsig-1 interface, according to our model ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Mutations along TM3 (A113W, G117F, and H120F) also block binding of Insig-2 to Scap ( Ren et al., 2015 39. Ren, R. ∙ Zhou, X. ∙ He, Y. ... PROTEIN STRUCTURE. Crystal structure of a mycobacterial Insig homolog provides insight into how these sensors monitor sterol levels Science. 2015; 349 :187-191 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) and are located at the Scap interaction interface in our structure. Five other mutations on multiple TMs of Insig-2 (G39F, C77D, F115A, T136A, and G200F) were shown to reduce Scap interaction while also diminishing 25-HC binding ( Table S3 ). In our structural model, all five of these residues face the core of Insig ( Figure 5 B, green spheres), which supports the idea that oxysterols bind in the interior of the TM bundle.
Superposition of the TM model of the cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex with that reported by Yan et al. (2021) 47. Yan, R. ∙ Cao, P. ∙ Song, W. ... A structure of human Scap bound to Insig-2 suggests how their interaction is regulated by sterols Science. 2021; 371 :eabb2224 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar for the human Scap/Insig-2 complex showed good agreement ( Figure 5 C; root-mean-square deviation, 2.8 Å). After docking of our cScap D435V /cInsig-1 model as a rigid body in the map of Yan et al. (2021) 47. Yan, R. ∙ Cao, P. ∙ Song, W. ... A structure of human Scap bound to Insig-2 suggests how their interaction is regulated by sterols Science. 2021; 371 :eabb2224 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar , the TM helices fit well, and our L1-L7 domain is situated within an observable but low-resolution feature that was assigned to the luminal region in the human Scap/Insig-2 reconstruction ( Figure 5 D). In our de novo model of L1-L7 in the cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex, we included L1 residues 53–278 and L7 residues 637–704. The L1-L7 domain structure in the complex ( Figure 4 E) is highly similar to that in cScap alone ( Figure 2 E), with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.77 Å.
Superimposing the TM helices in the cScap structure versus cScap D435V /cInsig-1, we observe several changes in conformation involving the SSD (TM2–TM6) and the luminal loops (L1-L7). In the cScap structure, we do not observe any cryo-EM density corresponding to TM2, whereas this helix is clearly resolved in the complex with cInsig-1 ( Figure 6 A). However, cScap contains density for a different TM helix that is not resolved in the complex with cInsig-1. Based on the continuity of this TM helix with density for the Scap CTD ( Figure 2 E), we tentatively assign this density to cScap TM8 ( Figure 6 A). Viewed from the cytosol ( Figure 6 B), the putative TM8 in cScap is packed against TM4 and TM5, which blocks the surface on cScap where cInsig-1 would bind. Comparison of the two structures implies that the cInsig-1 interaction with TM2, TM4, and TM5 helps to stabilize the position of TM2 within the SSD. In the absence of cInsig-1, the SSD can bind to cScap’s TM8 intramolecularly, bringing the Scap CTD into close proximity with the SSD TMs and making the CTD resolvable in our cScap cryo-EM map ( Figure 2 E). The CTD is not resolvable in the cScap D435V /cInsig-1 structure ( Figure 4 E).
In addition to this difference in TM architecture, we observe a large conformational difference in the relative position and orientation of the oblong L1-L7 domain in the two structures ( Figure 6 C). Compared with cScap, when cInsig-1 is bound in the cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex, L1-L7 has rotated by ∼215° horizontally in a plane parallel to the membrane ( Figure 6 C, right panel). A consequence of this rotation is a dramatic change in positioning of the L1-L7 domain relative to the SSD ( Figure 6 D). In cScap, L1-L7 is situated under the SSD ( Figure 6 D, center panel). In contrast, in the cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex, L1-L7 is no longer fully positioned under the SSD ( Figure 6 D, right panel). In this conformation, most of L1 (∼80%) extends away from the SSD, where it would reside under the lipid bilayer. L7 is anchored to the membrane by TM7 and TM8, which are displaced the most from the SSD. The multiple structural changes described above are summarized in schematic form in Figures 7 A and 7B and elaborated in the Discussion .
Figure S7 compares the architecture of Scap in its two conformations with four other SSD-containing proteins: NPC1, Patched, Dispatched, and NPC1-L1. In both cScap structures, the L1-L7 domain adopts an orientation with its long axis roughly parallel to the membrane. In contrast, in the other related SSD-containing proteins, the MLD-related subunits have their long axis pointing down from the membrane. The freedom of the cScap L1-L7 structure to adopt such different relative orientations may arise from the fact that Scap has a single TM SSD, whereas these other proteins have two pseudo-symmetrically interacting “SSD-MLD” units on the same polypeptide, which may restrict possible MLD motions. The variation in SSD-MLD disposition also highlights the adaptability of these subunits for different sterol-related functions.

Section: Discussion

Extensive studies of Scap have led to a working model for how it regulates cellular cholesterol levels. In this model, the interaction between Scap’s L1 and L7 is necessary for transport of SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, leading to an increase in cholesterol synthesis ( Brown et al., 2018 5. Brown, M.S. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Retrospective on Cholesterol Homeostasis: The Central Role of Scap Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :783-807 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, Y. ∙ Lee, K.M. ∙ Kinch, L.N. ... Direct demonstration that Loop1 of Scap binds to Loop7: A crucial event in cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :12888-12896 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Feedback regulation is initiated by binding of cholesterol to L1, which changes L1’s interaction with L7 on the luminal side of the ER membrane. The cholesterol signal is then propagated through the membrane-embedded SSD and culminates with movement of the cytosolic MELADL sequence, preventing binding to COPII proteins, halting SREBP transport, and decreasing cholesterol synthesis ( Brown et al., 2018 5. Brown, M.S. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Retrospective on Cholesterol Homeostasis: The Central Role of Scap Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :783-807 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our current structures highlight the modular nature of Scap in which TM2–TM6 of the SSD and TM7 and TM8 are linked in two ways: (1) through the MELADL-containing L6 on the cytosolic side and (2) through a luminal “platform” created by the intertwining of L1 and L7 ( Figures 3 and 7 ).
The significance of this modular architecture was revealed by comparison of our cScap structure with our cScap D435V /cInsig-1 structure ( Figure 6 ). When cInsig-1 binds cScap D435V , three major changes occur. First, although TM2 is not visible in the cScap structure, it becomes ordered and resolvable in cScap D435V at the cInsig-1 interface ( Figure 6 A). Second, the cInsig-1 TM bundle displaces cScap’s TM8 ( Figure 6 B). Third, the entire L1-L7 luminal platform rotates, positioning the TM7-TM8 module away from the rest of the SSD ( Figure 6 C-D). We hypothesize that cholesterol can change cScap’s conformation in a manner similar to that we observe for the cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex. A consequence of this large conformational change could be to alter the accessibility of the MELADL sequence on L6 (which is linked to TM7) to the COPII transport machinery ( Figure 7 ). In this model, cInsig-1 and cholesterol could act cooperatively to displace cScap’s TM8 from binding to the Scap SSD ( Figure 6 B), which may explain why cholesterol and Insigs are both required to fully curb ER-to-Golgi apparatus transport of Scap ( Lee et al., 2005 24. Lee, P.C.W. ∙ Sever, N. ∙ Debose-Boyd, R.A. Isolation of sterol-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells with genetic deficiencies in both Insig-1 and Insig-2 J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :25242-25249 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex TM region in our structure is generally similar to that reported in the human Scap/Insig-2 complex ( Figures 5 C and 5D). An exception is that the human Scap/Insig-2 interface is bridged by a putative 25-HC molecule in a cavity facing the ER lumen, created by a distortion in TM4 of Scap ( Yan et al., 2021 47. Yan, R. ∙ Cao, P. ∙ Song, W. ... A structure of human Scap bound to Insig-2 suggests how their interaction is regulated by sterols Science. 2021; 371 :eabb2224 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although a similar cavity is not apparent in the structure of our cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex, we still observe binding to 25-HC ( Figures 4 B and 4D), suggesting that the proposed 25-HC site in Yan et al. (2021) 47. Yan, R. ∙ Cao, P. ∙ Song, W. ... A structure of human Scap bound to Insig-2 suggests how their interaction is regulated by sterols Science. 2021; 371 :eabb2224 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar may not be the sole binding site for oxysterols. Notably, in both structures, the residues in Insig whose mutations affect high-affinity 25-HC binding as well as Scap binding are localized at the core of Insig, whereas residues whose mutations do not alter 25-HC binding but still affect Scap binding are at the interface ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Moreover, Insig-2 can bind 25-HC with high affinity in the absence of Scap ( Radhakrishnan et al., 2007 36. Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Ikeda, Y. ∙ Kwon, H.J. ... Sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: oxysterols block transport by binding to Insig Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :6511-6518 Crossref Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Insig binding to Scap can occur in the absence of 25-HC when triggered by cholesterol binding to Scap ( Adams et al., 2004 1. Adams, C.M. ∙ Reitz, J. ∙ De Brabander, J.K. ... Cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol inhibit activation of SREBPs by different mechanisms, both involving SCAP and Insigs J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :52772-52780 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional studies will be needed to elucidate the mechanism by which oxysterols promote the interaction between Scap and Insigs.
Cholesterol and 25-HC trigger binding of Scap to Insigs. In this work, we characterized the structures of cScap and cScap D435V /cInsig-1 in the absence of cholesterol or 25-HC. Although our purified chicken proteins bind these sterols with the expected affinity and specificity ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and 4 B–4D), we have not yet obtained structures with bound cholesterol. Therefore, we cannot say how cholesterol interacts with the luminal loops or how the L1 and L7 elements undergo conformational changes or dissociation in the presence of cholesterol. However, our atomic model of L1-L7 does provide insights into how cholesterol could change the conformation of Scap. This insight comes from the location of residues that, when mutated, lock Scap into a conformation that binds Insigs in the absence of cholesterol and prevents it from transporting SREBP2 ( Figure 3 ). For example, the previously characterized Y234A mutation on L1 will have a disruptive effect on this domain through destabilization of the core β sheet, and the Y666S mutation on L7 (Y640S in hamster) will remove stabilizing hydrophobic packing interactions between L1 and L7 ( Figure 3 B). Such destabilization will disfavor the conformation observed for cScap alone by preventing proper positioning of the L1-L7 luminal platform. Consistent with this hypothesis, structure-guided mutations predicted to destabilize L1-L7 also prevented Scap’s transport of SREBP2 ( Figure 3 F). Understanding the precise manner in which the tightly associated L1 and L7 undergo conformational changes and/or dissociation in the presence of cholesterol will require structural elucidation of cholesterol-bound cScap.
In our previous working model, we speculated that cholesterol binding to L1 causes L1 to dissociate from L7 and that this dissociation triggers a conformational change that promotes Insig binding, blocking movement of the Scap/SREBP complex to the Golgi apparatus ( Brown et al., 2018 5. Brown, M.S. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Retrospective on Cholesterol Homeostasis: The Central Role of Scap Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :783-807 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structural information in the current paper leads us to consider the alternate model shown in Figure 7 . In the new model, the L1-L7 complex does not dissociate but is in equilibrium between two positions: (1) residing directly underneath the SSD and (2) extending away from the SSD, allowing more contact with cholesterol in the membrane. If L1-L7 encounters cholesterol in the membrane, then it remains trapped in the extended state. In this state, the position of the TM7-TM8 module is altered, precluding exposure of the MELADL sequence at the cytosolic end of L6 and blocking its access to COPII proteins. In the cholesterol-bound conformation, TM8 would move away from the SSD, allowing Insig to bind. The association of Insig would stabilize the cholesterol-bound conformation of Scap and ensure that Scap cannot move to the Golgi apparatus. A corollary of this model is that, in the absence of membrane cholesterol, the L1-L7 complex may move continuously between its two positions, allowing L1 to scan the membrane for cholesterol. Distinguishing between our two working models will require determination of the structure of Scap bound to cholesterol. Attempts to determine this structure are underway.
We used the structure of the cInsig1-bound cScap D435V as a proxy for cholesterol-bound Scap that is retained in the ER. A structure of Scap bound to cholesterol, in detergent or in a nanodisc membrane, is needed to draw definitive conclusions regarding the mechanism of cholesterol sensing. Unlike the high resolution of the luminal L1-L7 region in our cryo-EM structures, the local resolution is low in the TM and cytosolic regions. Achieving higher resolution throughout the protein will be necessary to determine precisely how rotation of the luminal L1-L7 domain changes the accessibility of the cytosolic MELADL sequence, which mediates ER-to-Golgi apparatus transport of SREBPs.

Animal experiments to generate antibodies were performed at UT Southwestern with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee (#0745-07-01-1 for IgG-17H1; #2017-102391 for IgG-4G10). Mice were housed at 72°F and under a 12 hr light cycle (6AM on, 6PM off).
HEK293S GnTI - cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-3022). Cells were thawed in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (high glucose) medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F2442), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and passaged in monolayer culture at 37°C in 5% CO 2 .

Spdoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were cultured in SF900 II SFM media (GIBCO) at 27°C with orbital shaking at 120 rpm.
To guard against potential genomic instability, an aliquot of each cell line was passaged for only 4-6 weeks, after which a fresh batch of cells was thawed and propagated. All cell lines were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).
The expression plasmid pEZT-cScap D435V -3xFLAG encodes, in order from its NH 2 -terminus, chicken Scap (XP_025003137.1, residues 1-1323) containing a point mutation (D435V) followed by 3 copies of the FLAG motif DYKDDDDK GS DYKDDDDK GS DYKDDDDK . This construct is expressed downstream of the strong cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The coding sequence of this construct was codon-optimized for expression in human cells and produced as synthetic dsDNA pieces (gBlocks, IDT). These dsDNA pieces were assembled into a XhoI- and KpnI-linearized pEZT vector ( Morales-Perez et al., 2016 30. Morales-Perez, C.L. ∙ Noviello, C.M. ∙ Hibbs, R.E. Manipulation of Subunit Stoichiometry in Heteromeric Membrane Proteins Structure. 2016; 24 :797-805 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A tagless pEZT-cInsig-1 (Uniprot Q5ZMT9 , residues 28-252) was similarly designed, produced, and assembled into a pEZT vector that had been linearized with NheI and NotI restriction enzymes. The pEZT-cScap D435V -3xFLAG construct was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to generate pEZT-cScap-3xFLAG. For sterol-binding assays, we generated His-tagged Scap proteins where a His 8 tag was introduced at the NH 2 -terminus of the pEZT-cScap-3xFLAG constructs to generate the plasmids pEZT-His 8 -cScap-3xFLAG and pEZT-His 8 -cScap D435V -3xFLAG.
For large-scale expression of the Scap-Insig complex for immunizations, Fab characterization, and cryo-EM studies, we generated a pEZT plasmid modified to express both cInsig-1 and cScap D435V separated by a 2A “cleavage” peptide ( Liu et al., 2017 28. Liu, Z. ∙ Chen, O. ∙ Wall, J.B.J. ... Systematic comparison of 2A peptides for cloning multi-genes in a polycistronic vector Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :2193-2199 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ). This construct encodes, in order from its NH 2 -terminus, the residues MTG, cInsig-1 (residues 28-252), a 30-amino acid spacer SRENLYFQGGSGATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPG ∧ PA containing the 2A peptide from Porcine teschovirus (P2A), and the cScap D435V -3xFLAG described above. The ∧ denotes the break in the peptide chain caused by the 2A sequence leading to the production of cInsig-1 and cScap as two separate peptides. This plasmid is designated as pEZT-cInsig-1-2A-cScap D435V -3xFLAG.
The expression plasmid pFastBac-His 10 -hamster Scap(L1-L7) fusion has been previously described ( Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, Y. ∙ Lee, K.M. ∙ Kinch, L.N. ... Direct demonstration that Loop1 of Scap binds to Loop7: A crucial event in cholesterol homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :12888-12896 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Point mutations were introduced into this construct using site-directed mutagenesis. The expression plasmid encoding FLAG-human SREBP2 CTD has been previously described ( Kober et al., 2020 22. Kober, D.L. ∙ Xu, S. ∙ Li, S. ... Identification of a degradation signal at the carboxy terminus of SREBP2: A new role for this domain in cholesterol homeostasis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :28080-28091 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). The expression plasmid pFastBac-His 10 -cScap CTD encodes, in order from its NH 2 -terminus, a His 10 tag followed by cScap residues 779-1323. This construct was generated by subcloning from the pEZT-cScap-3xFLAG construct described above. The expression plasmid pFastBac-cScap(L1-L7) fusion encodes, in order from its NH 2 terminus, a honeybee melittin signal peptide, cScap residues 46-284, a 15-amino acid linker containing a TEV recognition site, S ENLYFQG SSGSSGS, cScap residues 542-738, and a His 10 tag. This fusion was generated by subcloning from the pEZT-cScap-3xFLAG plasmid described above.
For these assays, we generated plasmids that express proteins under the control of the weak Thymidine Kinase (TK) promotor. The pTK-HSV-SREBP2 plasmid ( Hua et al., 1996b 19.

To produce the mouse anti-Scap monoclonal antibody IgG-4G10, BALB/c mice were immunized with a mixture consisting of 50 μg chicken cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex purified in GDN detergent as described below and Ribi Adjuvant System (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This initial immunization was followed by 11 boosts, each consisting of 50 μg protein. Over 2500 hybridoma cells were created by fusing SP2-mIL6 mouse myeloma cells with splenic B lymphocytes derived from the immunized animal. Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened by ELISA for reactivity. ELISA screening was carried out in detergent-free conditions using biotinylated Scap-Insig complex that was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs as described below and captured on streptavidin-coated plates. 504 ELISA-positive clones were counter-screened by SDS-PAGE immunoblot against 10 ng purified Scap-Insig complex to select ELISA-positive but immunoblot-negative clones. 24 ELISA-positive, immunoblot-negative hybridomas were subcloned by serial dilution three times and their antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow columns. The eluted antibodies were dialyzed overnight against mAb dialysis buffer (10 mM NaPO 4 (pH 7.5) and 50 mM NaCl) and assayed for binding to detergent-solubilized cScap D435V -cInsig-1 by gel filtration. Three antibodies exhibited binding to Scap, but two of these were not useful in subsequent cryo-EM studies. Fortunately, the remaining antibody, designated IgG-4G10 (subclass 1, κ), proved to be useful as described below.
The Fab region of IgG-4G10 was sequenced as follows: RNA was extracted from the 4G10 hybridoma cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Single strand DNA (ssDNA) was generated from this RNA using the Superscript III First Strand kit (Invitrogen) with both random hexamers and oligo dT primers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting ssDNA was used to prepare double strand DNA (dsDNA) using the GoTaq Polymerase kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting dsDNA was probed with a series of primers designed to amplify different possible variable regions resulting from recombination (primers listed in Table S4 ). PCR products corresponding to the expected size of ∼500 bp were gel-extracted and sequenced. The sequences were analyzed using the IMGT database ( Giudicelli et al., 2011 11. Giudicelli, V. ∙ Brochet, X. ∙ Lefranc, M.-P. IMGT/V-QUEST: IMGT standardized analysis of the immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) nucleotide sequences Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2011; 2011 :695-715 PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify possible complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). The 4G10 hybridoma generated a single nucleotide sequence for both a heavy IgG and light IgK. To confirm this sequence, the 4G10 CDR was further subcloned into a shuttle vector and sequenced. The resulting coding sequence of the Fab domain is provided in Figure S2 C. To generate 4G10 Fab, IgG-4G10 was digested with 1:250 w/w papain for 2 hr at 37°C in mAb dialysis buffer (see above) supplemented with 1mM EDTA, 10 mM L-Cysteine hydrochloride, and 50 mM NaPO 4 (pH 7.5). Following digestion, the papain was inactivated with 30 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min on ice and the digested Fab was purified by gel filtration at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min over a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl. Purified Fab was used immediately for cScap D435V /Insig-1 complex binding experiments, including cryo-EM grid preparation, or else supplemented with 20% v/v glycerol and stored at −80°C for use in cScap(L1-L7) fusion binding experiments.
To produce the monoclonal antibody IgG-17H1 against Insig-1, BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant full-length human Insig-1 containing a His 10 epitope tag at its NH 2 -terminus and a FLAG epitope tag at its COOH-terminus that was purified using the same procedures as described previously for human Insig-2 ( Radhakrishnan et al., 2007 36.

USA. 2007; 104 :6511-6518 Crossref Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ). The purified protein was combined with Sigma Adjuvant System (Sigma-Aldrich Cat. S6322) (100 μg primary injection, followed by three 100 μg boosts, and ending with a final boost of 50 μg). Hybridoma cells were generated by fusing the splenic B lymphocytes with SP2-mIL6 mouse myeloma cells. After ELISA screening of hybridoma culture supernatants, one positive hybridoma, designated IgG-17H1 (subclass 2a, κ), was subcloned by serial dilution three times and purified by affinity chromatography using protein G-Sepharose4 Fast Flow columns.

Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 30 min. The clarified supernatant was incubated with 15 mL Ni 2+ -NTA beads for 1 hr to bind the His 10 -tagged cScap CTD. Following incubation, the resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min and transferred to an empty column. The resin was washed with 10 CV of wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl) that was supplemented with 50 mM imidazole (pH 7.5) and bound proteins were eluted in wash buffer supplemented with 300 mM imidazole directly onto a column containing 5 mL anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin in order to bind the 3xFLAG-tagged human SREBP2 CTD.

Supernatants were clarified by filtration through 0.2-micron filters and then passed through a column containing 10 mL Ni 2+ -NTA resin. The resin was washed with 10 CV of wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with 50 mM imidazole and bound proteins were eluted in wash buffer supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. The eluate was concentrated to 1 mL using a 30,000 MWCO Amicon centrifugal filter and subjected to gel filtration chromatography at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min over a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column that had been equilibrated in buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl.
For cryo-EM samples, 6 L cultures of HEK293 s GnTI - cells at a density of 2.5 million cells/ml were transduced with a single BacMam baculovirus (either pEZT-cScap-3xFLAG or pEZT-cInsig-1-2A-cScap D435V -3xFLAG) at an MOI of 3 virions per cell. For cholesterol binding studies, either a single BacMam virus (pEZT-His 8 -cScap-3xFLAG at MOI of 3) or two BacMam viruses (pEZT-cInsig-1 at MOI of 3 and pEZT-His 8 -cScap D435V -3xFLAG at MOI of 1) was used to infect cells. The cultures were supplemented with 2.5 mM sodium butyrate at the time of transduction in order to increase expression. Transduced cells were cultured for 60-72 hr with orbital shaking at 130 rpm in an incubator maintained at 30°C, 8% CO2, and 70% humidity. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C, washed with PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (160 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM E64, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin), and stored at −80°C until purification.
All purification steps were conducted on ice or at 4°C. Cell pellets were thawed, loosened by Dounce homogenization, and lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM TCEP, and protease inhibitors (160 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM E64, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin) while stirring for 30 min. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 21,000 x g for 30 min. Membranes were solubilized by Dounce homogenization in buffer containing a final concentration of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 20% v/v glycerol, 1% w/v LMNG, 0.2% w/v CHS, 0.2% w/v sodium cholate, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1 mU/μl benzonase, and protease inhibitors. After stirring for 1 hr, insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation for 1 hour at 100,000 x g. The supernatant was supplemented with additional protease inhibitors and incubated with 10 mL anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin for 4 hr. After the incubation, the resin was collected by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C, transferred to a gravity column, and washed with 10 CV M2 wash buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% w/v GDN, 0.001% w/v CHS, 10% v/v glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP) supplemented with protease inhibitors, followed by a final wash with 5 CV of M2 wash buffer without protease inhibitors. Bound proteins were eluted with M2 wash buffer supplemented with 400 μg/ml FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDA, Biomatik). Eluted proteins were concentrated to 1 mL using a 100,000 MWCO Amicon centrifugal filter and subjected to gel filtration at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min over a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% w/v GDN, 0.002% w/v CHS, and 0.5 mM TCEP. A typical purification from a 6 L culture yielded 2-3 mg of Scap or Scap-Insig complex.
To prepare samples for cryo-EM grids, the purified cScap and cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complexes were incubated for 2-3 hr on ice with 1.5 molar excess of 4G10 Fab . The mixtures were concentrated to 1 mL using a 100,000 MWCO Amicon centrifugal filter, and then subjected to gel filtration at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min over a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.004% w/v GDN, 0.0004% w/v CHS, and 0.5 mM TCEP. Fractions from the center of the gel filtration peak were concentrated to 5 mg/ml using a Sartorius 100 kDa centrifuge concentrator. The final sample was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet any debris and then the sample was vitrified as as quickly as possible as described below.
For immunizations, cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complexes were expressed as described above except that the transduced cultures were further supplemented with 300 nM 25-HC. Protein complexes were purified as described above for cryo-EM studies except that the M2 wash buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% w/v GDN, 600 nM 25-HC, 10% v/v glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP, and the gel filtration buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% w/v GDN, 600 nM 25-HC, and 0.5 mM TCEP.
For ELISA assays on hybridoma clones, the detergent-solubilized cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex was reconstituted into detergent-free saposin nanodiscs. For these studies, cScap D435V /cInsig-1 was purified as described above for cryo-EM studies except that the M2 wash buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% w/v LMNG, 0.01% w/v cholate, 0.01% w/v CHS, 600 nM 25-HC, 10% v/v glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP, and the gel filtration buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% w/v LMNG, 600 nM 25-HC, 0.002% w/v CHS, 0.002% w/v cholate, and 0.5 mM TCEP. Purified complexes were biotinylated with a 5-fold molar excess of EZ-link Biotin NHS ester for 30 min at room temperature. Unreacted biotin was quenched by addition of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 50 mM. The lipid mixture for reconstitution was prepared by combining 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and cholesterol in a molar ratio of 3:1:0.3 POPC:POPE:cholesterol, solubilizing the powder mixture in chloroform in glass vials, and then drying the lipid mixtures under Argon to form a thin film on the glass surface. The lipid film was hydrated in a buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 1% w/v cholate to yield a final concentration of 10 mM lipids, and then subjected to bath sonication for further solubilization. To initiate reconstitution, the biotinylated cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complex was mixed with a 60-fold molar excess of the solubilized lipids for 10 min on ice. After this incubation, saposin was added at a 3-fold molar excess of cScap D435V /cInsig-1 and the mixture was rotated for 1 hr at 4°C. Detergent was removed by incubating the sample with ∼50 mg Bio-Beads SM-2 Absorbent Media (BioRad) for 1 hr while rotating, after which the Bio-Beads were allowed to settle and the sample supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube containing ∼50 mg Bio-Beads. This process was repeated 4 additional times over the course of 12 hours. The final detergent-free sample was subjected to gel filtration at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min over a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated in buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 600 nM 25-HC, and 0.5 mM TCEP.
For 4G10 Fab binding studies ( Figures S2 E and S2F), cScap D435V /cInsig-1 complexes were purified as for immunizations.
His 8 -cScap and His 8 -cScap/cInsig-1 complexes were purified by virtue of their FLAG tag, as described above for cryo-EM studies, with the exception that LMNG detergent was used instead of GDN. The M2 wash buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% w/v LMNG, 0.01% w/v cholate, 0.01% w/v CHS, 10% v/v glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP. Following elution from the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin with M2 wash buffer supplemented with 400 μg/ml FLAG peptide, the proteins were subjected to gel filtration at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min over a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% w/v LMNG, 0.002% w/v CHS, 0.002% w/v cholate, and 0.5 mM TCEP. This gel filtration buffer was used as the “binding buffer” for all steps of the 3 H-sterol binding assays described above.
Quantifoil Au 300 mesh R 1.2/1.3 grids were plasma cleaned with air at 30 mA for 80 s using a Pelco easiglow machine. 3 μl of cScap/4G10 Fab or cScap D435V /cInsig-1/4G10 Fab samples were applied to grids at 4°C in 100% humidity and blotted for 4.5 s followed by freezing in liquid ethane cooled by liquid N 2 , using a Vitrobot Mark IV. Grids were stored in liquid N 2 until imaging.
Micrographs were acquired on a Titan Krios G2 microscope (Thermos Fisher) with a K3 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) in the super-resolution CDS counting mode, operated at 300 kV using SerialEM software. The calibrated magnification is 46,296. 9 images were collected for each stage movement using the beam-tilt imaging method. The slit width of the GIF-Quantum energy filter was set to 20 eV. Micrographs were dose-fractioned into 36 frames at the dose rate of ∼1.6 e − /Å 2 /frame.
Movie frames of cScap/4G10 Fab micrographs were motion-corrected and binned two-fold, resulting in a pixel size of 1.08 Å, and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 53. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ). CTF correction was performed using GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 50. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rest of the image processing steps were carried out using RELION 3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 54. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :163 Crossref Scopus (2936) Google Scholar ). Particles were first roughly picked by using the Laplacian-of-Gaussian blob method, and then subjected to 2D classification. Class averages representing projections of the cScap/4G10 Fab in different orientations were used as templates for reference-based particle picking. A total of 9,052,025 particles were picked from 10,641 micrographs. Particles were extracted and binned by three times (leading to 3.24 Å/pixel) and subjected to another round of 2D classification. Particles in good 2D classes were chosen (7,476,803 in total) for 3D classification using an initial model generated from a subset of the particles in RELION. Particles from one of the 3D classes showing good secondary structural features were selected and re-extracted into the original pixel size of 1.08 Å. Subsequently, we performed finer 3D classification by using local search in combination with small angular sampling. One resulting class showed improved density for the entire protein, and had better refinement statistics (resolution, alignment accuracy) than all other individual classes or combinations thereof. Therefore, this single class was selected for further processing. Refinement of the 223,673 particles in this class produced a reconstruction at 3.0 Å resolution after CTF refinement and particle polishing. To improve the resolution for L1-L7, we performed focused 3D refinement, along with CTF refinement and particle polishing, by using a soft mask around L1-L7 and part of 4G10 Fab . The final reconstruction of L1-L7 was resolved at 2.9 Å resolution. To improve the resolution for the TM region and CTD, we performed another round of 3D classification by using local angular search. One of the resulting classes shows improved density for the TM regions and visible density for CTD. 3D refinement of this class along with subtraction of density for the detergent micelle resulted in 3D reconstruction to an overall resolution of 4.1 Å after CTF refinement and particle polishing.
A total of 11,542,708 particles were picked from 14,526 micrographs of cScap D435V /cInsig-1/4G10 Fab . 9,521,887 particles were selected by 2D classification. Subsequently two rounds of 3D classification with 7.5 degree angular sampling together with one round of 3D classification with 3.75 degree angular sampling revealed one good class showing good density for L1-L7 and TMD. Refinement of the 155,187 particles in this class produced a reconstruction at 4.1 Å resolution after CTF refinement and particle polishing. All other classes, which had poorer refinement statistics (resolution, alignment accuracy) and displayed poorer density in both L1-L7 and TMD, were not selected for further processing. Additional 3D refinement was focused on L1-L7 and part of 4G10 Fab , leading to a reconstruction of L1-L7 at 3.5 Å resolution after CTF refinement and particle polishing. To improve the density of TM region, we performed a focused 3D classification with density subtraction ( Bai et al., 2015 2. Bai, X.-C. ∙ Rajendra, E. ∙ Yang, G. ... Sampling the conformational space of the catalytic subunit of human γ-secretase eLife. 2015; 4 :1485 Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar ). In this approach, the density corresponding to L1-L7 and 4G10 Fab as well as the detergent micelle density was subtracted from the original particles. The subsequent 3D classification on the modified particles was carried out by applying a mask around the TMD and having all of the orientations fixed at the value determined in the 3D refinement. This round of 3D classification yielded 5 classes of particles, among which one major class showed good density for the TM region. 3D refinement of this class yielded a structure at 4.6 Å resolution after CTF refinement and particle polishing.
To begin de novo building of the L1-L7 domain, two continuous chains of poly-alanine were built into the density de novo in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 8. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). One chain was identified as L7 by the unambiguous density for the glycan at N667, which is preceded by two well-ordered tyrosine residues. The other chain was identified as L1 and the register assignment was validated by the presence of the disulfide bond between C147 and C169 (see Figure S5 E). The Fab domains were built from templates created by docking the individual Ig domains from the heavy chain of PDB: 6SVL ( Ebenhoch et al., 2019 7. Ebenhoch, R. ∙ Akhdar, A. ∙ Reboll, M.R. ... Crystal structure and receptor-interacting residues of MYDGF - a protein mediating ischemic tissue repair Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5379 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the light chain of PDB: 5E94 ( Hennen et al., 2016 15. Hennen, S. ∙ Kodra, J.T. ∙ Soroka, V. ... Structural insight into antibody-mediated antagonism of the Glucagon-like peptide-1 Receptor Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :26236 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) into the density. The full L1-L7/4G10 Fab model was built in Coot and subjected to rounds of iterative real-space refinement in Phenix ( Liebschner et al., 2019 27. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3349) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by manual corrections in Coot and ISOLDE ( Croll, 2018 6. Croll, T.I. ISOLDE: a physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (780) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final cScap L1-L7 domain model includes L1 residues 53-278 and L7 residues 636-704. Residues 70-79 and 201-204 were omitted. The cScap D435V L1-L7 domain model includes L1 residues 53-278 and L7 residues 637-704. Residues 73-80 were omitted.
The density of the TM regions for both samples is not sufficiently resolved for de novo model building. The models of cScap and cInsig-1 TM regions were first built using the SWISS-MODEL homology-modeling server ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 45. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (7765) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the structures of NPC1 ( Li et al., 2016b 26. Li, X. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Coutavas, E. ... Structure of human Niemann-Pick C1 protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :8212-8217 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mycobacterial Insig ( Ren et al., 2015 39. Ren, R. ∙ Zhou, X. ∙ He, Y. ... PROTEIN STRUCTURE. Crystal structure of a mycobacterial Insig homolog provides insight into how these sensors monitor sterol levels Science. 2015; 349 :187-191 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) as templates. The generated models were manually inspected and flexible regions were removed. These models were rigid-body fitted into the cryo-EM density of cScap/4G10 Fab or cScap D435V /cInsig-1/4G10 Fab in Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 34. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ) with good agreement. To reduce ambiguity in model building, all side chains were removed from the coordinates. The resulting backbone model was subsequently refined against the map using strong secondary structure restraints in Phenix ( Liebschner et al., 2019 27. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3349) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model of the CTD was built by using SWISS-MODEL sequence-based homology-modeling approach ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 45. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (7765) PubMed Google Scholar ). This model was rigid-body fitted into the cryo-EM density of cScap/4G10 Fab , showing good agreement in shape and size. However, the precise orientation of the CTD relative to the TM domain cannot be determined unambiguously, due to the lack of resolved secondary structural features. Model geometries were assessed using Molprobity as part of the Phenix validation tools.
Cryo-EM data collection, analysis, and refinement statistics are shown in Table S1 . For 3 H-sterol binding studies ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and 4 B–4D), error bars indicate standard error of the mean of triplicate assays.
