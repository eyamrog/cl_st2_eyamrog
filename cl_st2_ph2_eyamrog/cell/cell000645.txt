Title: Large-scale multiplexed mosaic CRISPR perturbation in the whole organism


Abstract: Summary

Here, we report inducible mosaic animal for perturbation (iMAP), a transgenic platform enabling in situ CRISPR targeting of at least 100 genes in parallel throughout the mouse body. iMAP combines Cre-loxP and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies and utilizes a germline-transmitted transgene carrying a large array of individually floxed, tandemly linked gRNA-coding units. Cre-mediated recombination triggers expression of all the gRNAs in the array but only one of them per cell, converting the mice to mosaic organisms suitable for phenotypic characterization and also for high-throughput derivation of conventional single-gene perturbation lines via breeding. Using gRNA representation as a readout, we mapped a miniature Perturb-Atlas cataloging the perturbations of 90 genes across 39 tissues, which yields rich insights into context-dependent gene functions and provides a glimpse of the potential of iMAP in genome decoding.

Section: Introduction

The functions of the ∼20,000 mammalian protein-coding genes in the hundreds of cell types remain largely enigmatic ( Brown and Lad, 2019 10. Brown, S.D.M. ∙ Lad, H.V.

The legacy of the Human Genome Project Science. 2021; 373 :1442-1443 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). To unveil the function of a gene in a cell, one needs to perturb the gene and determine its direct, cell-intrinsic effects on cellular attributes such as survival, proliferation, transcriptome, and epigenome. “Mouse Cell Perturb-Atlases” comprehensively cataloging such effects throughout the mouse body for all the protein-coding genes would serve as a valuable baseline reference map in functional genomics. Mapping these atlases would require high-throughput, pan-tissue gene targeting in mice. Conventional mouse gene knockout (KO) methods are inapplicable here not only because of their low throughput but also because the KO often produces severe cell-extrinsic effects that obscure cell-intrinsic phenotypes. Both problems can be avoided using CRISPR perturbations with pooled viral gRNA libraries, as demonstrated in CRISPR screens in mice. In such screens, many genes are perturbed in parallel in a single mouse, and the perturbation is mosaic, with the same genes disrupted in only tiny fractions of the target cells, which minimizes cell-extrinsic phenotypes ( Doench, 2018 23.

Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unfortunately, for in situ targeting, the library delivery is inefficient, nonuniform, and applicable thus far only to a few accessible solid organs, whereas the transplantation method not only strips spatial information off the cells but is also complex and applicable only to the few cell types that are both transplantable and transducible. Furthermore, the viral libraries and the transduced cells are not recyclable, necessitating repetitive preparations of these precious reagents, which is labor-intensive, cost-ineffective, and prone to batch effects. Thus, effective perturbation tools for mapping the Perturb-Atlases remain elusive.
We have filled the void using a germline-transmitted transgene capable of inducible expression of at least 100 gRNAs per mouse but only one per cell. The system is virus-free, simple, and robust, with the mouse lines recurrently accessible, thus bypassing the aforementioned limitations of the viral libraries. In this study, we first proved the principle of our strategy by perturbing six genes with known functions and then constructed a miniature Perturb-Atlas profiling representations of the gRNAs targeting 90 genes across 39 mouse organs/tissues/cell types (“tissues” hereafter). Finally, we demonstrated that the system could readily produce pools of conventional single-KO mouse lines.

Section: Results

At the heart of inducible mosaic animal for perturbation (iMAP) is a transgene comprising four parts ( Figure 1 A): (1) a pair of piggyBac inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) flanking the transgene, which mediates random single-copy transgene integration, a prerequisite for expressing only one gRNA per cell; (2) a modified mouse U6 promoter carrying a bifunctional LoxP site (TATA-lox71), which can not only undergo Cre-mediated recombination but also direct gRNA expression using a TATA box embedded in its spacer ( Albert et al., 1995 2. Albert, H. ∙ Dale, E.C. ∙ Lee, E. ... Site-specific integration of DNA into wild-type and mutant lox sites placed in the plant genome Plant J. 1995; 7 :649-659 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ventura et al., 2004 95. Ventura, A. ∙ Meissner, A. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ... Cre-lox-regulated conditional RNA interference from transgenes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :10380-10385 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ); (3) a gRNA-coding sequence (“guide” hereafter, encoding both the spacer and the scaffold) in conjunction with a transcription terminator (a string of Ts), placed immediately downstream of the U6 promoter; this position is termed Position 0 (P0), and the corresponding guide is termed “g0”; and (4) a series of tandemly linked guides (g1, 2, 3...), each ending at a transcription terminator and floxed with another bifunctional LoxP site (TATA-LoxTC9). Lox71 ( Albert et al., 1995 2. Albert, H. ∙ Dale, E.C. ∙ Lee, E. ... Site-specific integration of DNA into wild-type and mutant lox sites placed in the plant genome Plant J. 1995; 7 :649-659 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ) and LoxTC9 (developed in this study; Figures S1 and STAR Methods ) are LoxP variants bearing mutations at the 5' and 3' inverted repeats, respectively. At the default state, only g0 is expressed. Following Cre-mediated recombination between Lox71 and LoxTC9, the downstream guides can all be induced in the mouse, but only one of these guides per cell ( Figure 1 B). Importantly, the recombination produces an inactive LoxP bearing the mutations originating from both Lox71 and TC9, which prevents the U6 promoter from undergoing extra rounds of recombination, thus avoiding the sequential expression of distinct guides in the same cells. In the presence of Cas9, all genes specified by the transgene can be knocked out but only one per cell (not counting the gene targeted by g0, which is constitutively expressed), which results in genetic mosaicism ready for Perturb-Atlas mapping across various tissues, assuming that both Cre and Cas9 are ubiquitously expressed ( Figure 1 C). Because the KO should occur in the germ cells in addition to the soma, conventional KO lines, with a single gene targeted per line, can be derived from the mosaic males rapidly and cost-effectively via simple breeding ( Figure 1 D), which have complementary utilities to the mosaic mice (see discussion ). Of note, the Cre/Lox system has been employed to achieve stochastic mosaic expression of genetic elements in mice, but only at a much smaller scale than iMAP (a few cDNAs versus 100 guides) ( Pontes-Quero et al., 2017 77.

Brainbow: new resources and emerging biological applications for multicolor genetic labeling and analysis Genetics. 2015; 199 :293-306 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We first constructed a transgene carrying 61 guides targeting seven marker genes whose KO should produce well-defined phenotypes ( Figure 2 A). The default P0 guide (g0) targets CD47, a widely expressed surface protein detectable by FACS, which offers a quick readout for U6 promoter activity. Although Cd47 encodes a “do not eat me” signal important for tumor evasion, its KO is known to produce little spontaneous pathology and thus should not confound the analysis. Nevertheless, as a precaution, the Cd47 guide was designed to mutate an alternatively spliced exon, which may reduce but not abolish CD47 expression ( Chen et al., 2020 15. Chen, Y. ∙ Sun, J. ∙ Mao, S. ... Novel mosaic mice with diverse applications Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The remaining 60 guides target six genes (10 guides/target) classified into three groups (essential genes, tumor suppressor genes, and marker genes) with readily detectable group-specific effects ( Figure 2 A, table).
We used piggyBac to generate a 61-guide transgenic line and passed the transgene for five generations before mating the F5 mice with the CAG-Cas9 transgenic mice constitutively expressing Cas9. The resultant 61-guide; Cas9 mice (F6) were analyzed for transgene function and sequence integrity. Sequence integrity was additionally evaluated in the F13 generation.
We found the U6 promoter active in various organs, as manifested by g Cd47 expression ( Figure 2 B) and a lack of U6 promoter methylation ( Figures 2 C and S2 A). The promoter must also be active in early embryos, as inferred from the fact that in the adults, the descendants of the three germ layers carried comparable indels at Cd47 ( Figure 2 D). The perturbation slightly compromised CD47 expression as intended ( Figure S2 B).
To determine transgene integrity, we isolated tail DNA from the F6 mice and PCR-amplified three overlapping fragments covering the entire transgene, finding no truncation ( Figure 2 E, bottom left), which was also true in the F13 mice ( Figure 2 E, bottom right).
To characterize recombination, we introduced the Ubc-CreER transgene widely expressing CreER (“ Cre ”) into 61-guide mice (F5) to generate 61-guide; Cre adults (F6), which were then exposed to different doses of tamoxifen (TAM, 0.2 mg/g daily for 1 or 3 days) before various organs were harvested 6–15 days thereafter. The guides at P0 were amplified using the primer pair a/b ( Figure 1 B), and their representation quantified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). TAM sensitivities varied somewhat among different organs/mice, but upon recombination, the default P0 guide (g Cd47 ) was invariably replaced by the downstream guides that had now occupied the P0 position, with the proximal guides (g1–29, particularly g1–9) better represented than the distal guides (g30–60); this bias was mitigated following extensive (81%–89%) recombination as measured by g Cd47 deletion rates, when the distal guides constituted up to 6%–9% of all the P0 guides as opposed to only 2% upon less extensive (36%) recombination ( Figure 2 F). We found 50× coverage (50 copies of PCR template/P0 guide) sufficient for reliable quantification and thus used 0.1 million cells in subsequent experiments to confer at least 100× coverage for all the P0 guides following >60% recombination.
We conclude that the transgene can remain structurally intact, transcriptionally active, and recombination-competent for at least 6–13 generations.
We next studied 61-guide; Ubc-CreER; CAG-Cas9 mice (“iMAP-61”), generated by crossing the 61-guide; Ubc-CreER (F6) and the CAG-Cas9 ; Ubc-CreER lines. The mice were exposed to TAM for 6 days starting on postnatal day 10 (D10), became visibly emaciated by D50, and were sacrificed 2–3 weeks later for humane concerns. By this time, the mice had developed huge thymomas presumably due to Pten/Trp53 KO ( Figure 3 A), concomitant with mild enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes ( Figure S3 A) and with loss of lymphocyte CD45/CD19 expression ( Figure S3 B, Columns 6–10). Mice treated with TAM in adulthood displayed similar defects but with longer latency (∼three months after treatment, unpublished). These data suggest successful perturbation of both the tumor suppressors ( Pten/Trp53 ) and marker genes ( Cd45 and Cd19 ).
We next profiled the guide composition at P0 in the thymoma. Because Cd19 is not expressed in the thymus and its KO should thus be inconsequential, g Cd19 was used as the internal control to normalize the raw reads of various P0 guides before comparison with that in the control mice ( 61-guide; Cre ). We found the 20 Pten and Trp53 guides clearly enriched (≥2× relative to the control mice) except two (g49- Trp53- 9 and g55- Trp53- 10), whereas the 19 Kpnb1 and Polr2a guides clearly depleted ( ≥ 2×) except four (g45- Kpnb1 -8, g16- Polr2a -3, g34- Polr2a -6, g40- Polr2a -7), demonstrating that the thymoma was polyclonal and that 85% (33/39) of these guides were clearly effective ( Figures 3 A and 3B). In agreement with our data, Pten and Trp53 KO in thymocytes can each cause polyclonal thymoma ( Dudgeon et al., 2014 26. Dudgeon, C. ∙ Chan, C. ∙ Kang, W. ... The evolution of thymic lymphomas in p53 knockout mice Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :2613-2620 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hagenbeek and Spits, 2008 36. Hagenbeek, T.J. ∙ Spits, H. T-cell lymphomas in T-cell-specific Pten-deficient mice originate in the thymus Leukemia. 2008; 22 :608-619 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also examined g Cd45 . Cd45 KO is known to impair thymocyte development, halving double-positive (DP) thymocyte cellularity ( Byth et al., 1996 12. Byth, K.F. ∙ Conroy, L.A. ∙ Howlett, S. ... CD45-null transgenic mice reveal a positive regulatory role for CD45 in early thymocyte development, in the selection of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, and B cell maturation J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183 :1707-1718 Crossref Scopus (359) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, although the thymoma comprised predominantly DP thymocytes ( Figure S3 B, columns 1–5), eight of the ten g Cd45 were enriched in the thymoma ( Figures 3 A and 3B, white), perhaps because g Cd45 could act in concert with some growth factors secreted by the tumor cells to expand the thymocytes.
Finally, RNA-seq analysis of the thymoma dominated by g5- Pten -1 (marked by a triangle in Figure 3 B) revealed that this guide caused biallelic Pten inactivation and subsequent dramatic clonal expansion and that the thymoma transcriptome was comparable with that of thymoma induced by conditional Pten KO ( Figures S3 D and S3F; Pankaew et al., 2022 73. Pankaew, S. ∙ Potier, D. ∙ Grosjean, C. ... Calcium signaling is impaired in PTEN-deficient T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Front. Immunol. 2022; 13 , 797244 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In conclusion, g Kpnb1/Polr2a/Pten/Trp53/Cd45 were mostly effective and gCd19 was not aberrantly altered in the thymus, providing the first line of evidence for the robustness of iMAP.
We surveyed the 59 guides across ten tissues and analyzed depletion (g Kpnb1 / Polr2a ) and enrichment (g Pten / Trp53/Cd45 ) in separate guide-by-tissue matrices, with g Cd19 included as the control for both. Four mice were analyzed, and pairwise comparisons of the NGS data revealed impressive reproducibility among the replicates (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.86–0.9; Figure S3 C).
In the depletion matrix ( Figure 3 C), the ten tissues formed three hierarchical clusters (tCluster A-C) with increasing sensitivity to Cas9. This sensitivity is theoretically dictated by Cas9 cleavage in conjunction with the ensuing biological response. Since Kpnb1 and Polr2a are essential for all cells, the tissue-specific sensitivity to g Kpnb1 / Polr2a should reflect variations in Cas9 cleavage. Interestingly, g Kpn1 / Polr2a depletion was more pronounced in the tissues with high turnover rates than in static tissues (Tissue 07–10 versus 01–06), suggesting proliferation faciliates Cas9 cleavage.
Like the ten tissues, the 29 guides (nine g Kpnb1 , ten g Polr2a , and ten g Cd19 ) also formed three clusters where the depletion was negligible (gClusters I), obvious ( ≥ 2×) only in the sensitive tissues (gClusters II), and obvious in all ten tissues (gClusters III), respectively. The ten g Cd19 were all in gCluster I as expected, whereas for the 19 g Kpnb1 / Polr2a , three each were distributed in gClusters I and III while 13 in gCluster II. These data indicate that the inactive (gCluster I) or superactive (gCluster III) guides were both rare (3/19 or 16%) compared with the moderately active (gCluster II,13/19 or 68%), which is also evident by comparing the median fold-depletion of each guide across the ten tissues ( Figure 3 E top, Kpnb1 , and Polr2a ). We also calculated the median fold-depletion among the nine g Kpnb1 and the ten g Polr2a , respectively, for each of the ten tissues, finding that the depletion was readily detectable even in the least sensitive tCluster A (liver and heart)—thanks to the clean background displayed by g Cd19 ( Figure 3 E bottom, Cd19, Kpnb1 , and Polr2a ). Indeed, 11 and 13 of the 19 g Kpnb1 / Polr2a (63% on average) were depleted beyond the detection limit (1.5×) in the liver and heart, respectively, whereas the numbers rose to 14–18 (87% on average) in the remaining eight tissues. Thus, if a single guide targeting Kpnb1 or Polr2a is used in iMAP-61, there would be 63%, 87%, and 82% chances that its depletion is detectable in the least sensitive, more sensitive, and across all ten tissues, respectively.
Next, we examined the 30 Pten / Trp53/Cd45 guides, finding that the tissues varied in their sensitivities to these guides ( Figures 3 D and 3E), which was generally consistent with the tissue-specific functions of the target genes. For example, g Pten enrichment was negligible in the cerebrum but obvious in the heart and liver ( Figure 3 E bottom), supporting reports that Pten KO is inconsequential in neurons ( Kwon et al., 2001 56. Kwon, C.H. ∙ Zhu, X. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Pten regulates neuronal soma size: a mouse model of Lhermitte-Duclos disease Nat. Genet. 2001; 29 :404-411 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar , 2006 55.

Pten regulates neuronal arborization and social interaction in mice Neuron. 2006; 50 :377-388 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (738) PubMed Google Scholar ) but causes massive hepatomegaly and cardiac hypertrophy ( Horie et al., 2004 42. Horie, Y. ∙ Suzuki, A. ∙ Kataoka, E. ... Hepatocyte-specific Pten deficiency results in steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinomas J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113 :1774-1783 Crossref Scopus (549) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roe et al., 2015 82. Roe, N.D. ∙ Xu, X. ∙ Kandadi, M.R. ... Targeted deletion of PTEN in cardiomyocytes renders cardiac contractile dysfunction through interruption of Pink1-AMPK signaling and autophagy Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1852 :290-298 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, Pten KO causes thymomas, which can explain why g Pten enrichment was more dramatic in the thymus than in the heart and liver ( Figure 3 E bottom). Importantly, with only two exceptions (3- Cd45 -8 and 9- Trp53 -10), all 30 guides proved active, their enrichment being detectable at least in the sensitive tissues ( Figures 3 D and 3E). The final observation regarding the enrichment matrix is that when its color scheme is applied to the depletion matrix, g Polr2a -7 enrichment, presumably reflecting off-target editing, became clearly visible, but the effect proved rather moderate (2.3×) and restricted to a single tissue, i.e., the testis ( Figure 3 D, last strip).
In summary, 90% (44/49) of the Kpnb1/Polr2a/Pten/Trp53/Cd45 guides were active, producing strong signals in sensitive tissues and often weak yet detectable signals in relatively refractory tissues. In contrast, off-target effects were rare, being evident for only one of 59 guides and manifested as moderate enrichment in only one out of ten tissues. Of note, we did not detect any evident off-target depletion. Presumably, off-target editing, typically inefficient and thus present only in a minor fraction of a cell population, would be hardly detectable unless the editing induces cell proliferation (and hence signal amplification). Indeed, in CRISPR screens, significant guide depletion via off-target editing is observed only for highly promiscuous guides ( Hart et al., 2015 37. Hart, T. ∙ Chandrashekhar, M. ∙ Aregger, M. ... High-resolution CRISPR screens reveal fitness genes and genotype-specific cancer liabilities Cell. 2015; 163 :1515-1526 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ); such guides have been excluded in our design. These data demonstrate that a “one guide/target” design may maximize the experimental throughput without much sacrifice of robustness, which we have applied to the 100-guide transgene.
As an entry point toward the comprehensive Perturb-Atlas, we sought to construct a miniature version using embryonic essential genes as a model. These genes comprise ∼1/3 of mouse protein-coding genes, many widely expressed in adults. However, their functions in adults are difficult to decipher using conventional constitutive or tissue-specific KO, because the former causes embryonic lethality, whereas the latter is typically performed on limited numbers of tissues. In contrast, iMAP enables a simultaneous survey of their functions across diverse tissues in adult mice. Based on the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database, we selected 87 genes whose KO kills embryos at various stages of development with complete penetrance and added three controls dispensable for embryogenesis ( Morf4l2 , Prkaca , and Prkacb ). We designed a 100-guide transgene carrying 90 corresponding targeting guides spiked with eight nontargeting negative control guides (NC) and flanked with g Cd19 (g0) and g Cd47 (g99; Figure 4 A). g Cd19 targets the B-cell-restricted marker CD19, offering a convenient readout of U6 promoter activity. g Cd47 was appended to address a caveat: extensive recombination enhances distal guide representation but can also eliminate all the guides in the array, yielding a useless “0-mer” lacking any guide ( Chen et al., 2020 15. Chen, Y. ∙ Sun, J. ∙ Mao, S. ... Novel mosaic mice with diverse applications Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). g Cd47 would tag the 0-mer, enabling its quantification by FACS/NGS and thus facilitating optimization of recombination.
We generated two 100-guide transgenic lines and sought to comprehensively analyze the F5 generation, with the transgene integrity additionally evaluated in the F10 generation. Line 1 displayed higher g Cd19 expression ( Figure S4 A) and was further characterized. We found its U6 promoter unmethylated, the Cd19 locus efficiently targeted, CD19 expression fully eliminated, and the transgene intact ( Figures S4 B and S4E). Thus, the transgene can remain stable for at least 5–10 generations. Remarkably, although g Cd19 expression was higher in Line 1 than in Line 2, the opposite was true for mCherry, highlighting the dichotomy in chromatin environment requirements for Pol II versus Pol III promoters ( Figure S4 F; see also STAR Methods ). Finally, following recombination, all downstream guides became detectable at P0, with the proximal guides (g1–29) better represented than the distal ones (g30–99) as expected ( Figure S4 G). Interestingly, even with extensive (77%) recombination, few 0-mers (0.86%) emerged; thus, subsequent studies were performed under the condition of extensive recombination.
We treated five 100-guide , Ubc-CreER , and CAG-Cas9 mice (“iMAP-100”) with TAM around D10 and performed the analysis three (4 mice) or four (1 mouse) months thereafter. The mice were grossly normal except for polycystic kidneys in the latter mouse and atrophic testes in all four males ( Figure 4 B). In the testis, the proportions of stem cells (spermatogonia) and their progeny seemed normal, indicating that testicular atrophy mainly reflected depletion of spermatogonia rather than blockade of their further differentiation ( Figure S5 A). Mirroring the atrophic phenotype, the 98 guides in the testes were generally depleted, some very dramatically (up to 45×); the depletion was not random because g Morf4l2 and all the gNC were spared, whereas g Adar was even enriched ( Figure 4 C). We found relevant literature for nine of the 90 genes targeted in iMAP-100 (brown, Figure 4 C), which agree well with our data except for Prkaca/b , Dnmt3b , and Adar ( Houzelstein et al., 2002 43.

We have profiled the 98 guides in a total of 39 tissues sampled from the five mice and used a heatmap to display the 3,822 data points ( Figure 4 D); each data point was averaged from at least two (mostly 3–4) mice, the replicates being highly reproducible ( Figure S5 B). The guides and tissues clustered into five (I–V) and six (A–F) groups, respectively ( Figure 4 D). Guide depletion events were predominant, constituting 60% of the 3,822 data points using fold-change ≥ 2 as the threshold (black lines) or 78% using gNC for comparison (green lines), contrary to only 0.9%–2% for the enrichment and 20%–39% for the unaltered ( Figure 4 E). Thus, for the heatmap, we applied a color scheme that ignores the enrichment (scored as “unaltered”) to better visualize the depletion; the enrichment was analyzed separately using a simple bar graph ( Figure 4 F). For all guides except those in gCluster V, the alterations were tissue-restricted, occasionally highly so, occurring in only one of 39 tissues ( Figure 4 G) or unilaterally in a pair of closely related tissues ( Figure 4 H). Our data mining is not exhaustive but has already led to diverse discoveries as well as rediscoveries, the latter serving to validate our system, as detailed below.
Enrichment was detected only for five guides ( Figure 4 F):
First, g Tsc2 was enriched dramatically (95×, n = 1) in the polycystic kidneys (Tissue 5a, “T5a” hereafter) and to lower extents (7×) in the normal-looking kidney (T5b, n = 3), in addition to perigonadal fat (pFat), tongue, ear lobe, and epididymis (T7, 9, 12, and 15). Tsc2 is a mTOR1 repressor, and its deletion in kidneys causes polycystic lesions, whereas Tsc2 +/− mice tend to develop multiple tumors ( Onda et al., 1999 72. Onda, H. ∙ Lueck, A. ∙ Marks, P.W. ... Tsc2(+/−) mice develop tumors in multiple sites that express gelsolin and are influenced by genetic background J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104 :687-695 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ren et al., 2016 79. Ren, S. ∙ Luo, Y. ∙ Chen, H. ... Inactivation of Tsc2 in mesoderm-derived cells causes polycystic kidney lesions and impairs lung alveolarization Am. J. Pathol. 2016; 186 :3261-3272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), which supports our data.
Second, g Psen1 was enriched 4–10× in skin-related tissues (ear lobe, dorsal skin dermis, dorsal skin epidermis, and tail epidermis; T12, 13, 16, and 18), consistent with Psen1 deficiency causing excessive epidermal cell proliferation ( Xia et al., 2001 101. Xia, X. ∙ Qian, S. ∙ Soriano, S. ... Loss of presenilin 1 is associated with enhanced beta-catenin signaling and skin tumorigenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :10863-10868 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Third, g Krit1/Ccm1 and g Ccm2 were enriched 4× and 1.8×, respectively, in pFat (T7). Supporting our data, the two genes each encode an essential subunit of the same protein complex, with Krit1/Ccm1 (and Ccm2 by inference) capable of inhibiting β-catenin-driven adenoma development ( Glading and Ginsberg, 2010 33. Glading, A.J. ∙ Ginsberg, M.H. Rap1 and its effector KRIT1/CCM1 regulate beta-catenin signaling Dis. Model. Mech. 2010; 3 :73-83 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Fourth, g Adar was enriched ∼2× in spermatogonia (T34) and all the progeny cells (T36–39). The enrichment was apparently established in spermatogonia and propagated to the progeny, given that the mice were exposed on D10 and analyzed 3–4 months later, when the TAM-exposed spermatogonia had produced the progeny. Paradoxically, Adar KO in the male germline using the Stra8-iCre transgene does not affect spermatogenesis ( Snyder et al., 2017 91. Snyder, E.M. ∙ Licht, K. ∙ Braun, R.E. Testicular adenosine to inosine RNA editing in the mouse is mediated by ADARB1 Biol. Reprod. 2017; 96 :244-253 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, gene KO with this Cre line is very inefficient in spermatogonia, reaching completion only in pachytene spermatocytes ( Bao et al., 2013 6. Bao, J. ∙ Ma, H.-Y. ∙ Schuster, A. ... Incomplete Cre-mediated excision leads to phenotypic differences between Stra8-iCre; Mov10l1lox/lox and Stra8-iCre; Mov10l1lox/Δ mice Genesis. 2013; 51 :481-490 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). This can not only reconcile the discrepancy regarding spermatogonia but also support our conclusion that Adar did not impact the progeny.
The heatmap in Figure 4 D has the following salient features:
First, related guides tended to co-segregate. Thus, the eight gNC tightly co-segregated (gCluster I, which expectedly harbored g Morf4l2 ), as did three pairs (g30- Ccm2 with g31- Krit1 / Ccm1 , g80- Phb with g81- Phb 2, and g95- Prpf3 with g96- Prpf31 ) whose target genes each encode one of the essential subunits of the respective protein complexes and their KO produces nearly identical phenotypes ( Baranoski et al., 2016 7. Baranoski, J.F. ∙ Kalani, M.Y.S. ∙ Przybylowski, C.J. ... Cerebral cavernous malformations: review of the genetic and protein–protein interactions resulting in disease pathogenesis Front.

Three gene-targeted mouse models of RNA splicing factor RP show late-onset RPE and retinal degeneration Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2011; 52 :190-198 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ross et al., 2008 86. Ross, J.A. ∙ Nagy, Z.S. ∙ Kirken, R.A. 1/2 Phosphocomplex is required for mitochondrial homeostasis and survival of human T cells J. Biol. Chem. Phys. B. 2008; 283 :4699-4713 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two other pairs (g68- Rnaseh2c with g73- Rnaseh1 and g13- Prkacb with g20- Prkaca ) were also linked but less tightly. Consistent with this, RNase h1 and h2c both degrade RNA in the RNA-DNA duplex in the nucleus, and their KO each causes early lethality, but only RNase h1 is also required for mitochondrial DNA replication ( Cerritelli et al., 2003 13. Cerritelli, S.M. ∙ Frolova, E.G. ∙ Feng, C. ... Failure to produce mitochondrial DNA results in embryonic lethality in Rnaseh1 null mice Mol. Cell. 2003; 11 :807-815 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hiller et al., 2012 41. Hiller, B. ∙ Achleitner, M. ∙ Glage, S. ... Mammalian RNase H2 removes ribonucleotides from DNA to maintain genome integrity J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :1419-1426 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, Prkaca and Prkacb , encoding different isoforms of the Protein Kinase A catalytic subunits, are both dispensable for embryogenesis, but Prkaca KO mice are runted and susceptible to perinatal death, contrary to Prkacb KO mice with only mild memory defects ( Howe et al., 2002 44. Howe, D.G. ∙ Wiley, J.C. ∙ McKnight, G.S. Molecular and behavioral effects of a null mutation in all PKA Cβ isoforms Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20 :515-524 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Skålhegg et al., 2002 89. Skålhegg, B.S. ∙ Huang, Y. ∙ Su, T. ... Mutation of the Calpha subunit of PKA leads to growth retardation and sperm dysfunction Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16 :630-639 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). At the other extreme, g22- Dnmt3b and g79- Dnmt1 targeted two genes with highly divergent functions (initiation versus maintenance of DNA methylation) as did g27- Hdac7 and g82- Hdac3 ( Li et al., 2020 59. Li, G. ∙ Tian, Y. ∙ Zhu, W.-G. The roles of histone deacetylases and their inhibitors in cancer therapy Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2020; 8 :576946 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ), which can explain their wide separations. Furthermore, the DNA methylation pattern is established mostly during embryogenesis but actively maintained in adults, explaining why g79 -Dnmt1 depletion was far more pronounced than g22- Dnmt3b .
Second, relevant tissues tended to co-segregate just as relevant guides, including cerebellum and cerebrum (T1–2), skin-related tissues (T12–18), intestine-related tissues (T19–23), lymphocyte subsets (T24–33), and male germ cell subsets (T34–39). Of note, just as in iMAP-61, brain and heart co-segregated (tCluster A) and static tissues seemed less susceptible to Cas9 perturbation than tissues with higher turn-over rates (tClusters A–B versus D–F).
Third, the effects of the guides mirrored that of their target gene KO: g2- Morf4l2 (gCluster I) was inconsequential just as Morf4l2 KO, whereas the guides in gClusters II–V caused increasingly prevalent cell death just as their target gene KO causes increasingly earlier embryonic lethality (E12,10, 7, and 6, respectively; Figure S5 C).
Finally, the genes generally required for cell survival in iMAP-100 were enriched with the “core essential genes” (CEGs) generally required for human tumor cell survival/proliferation ( Hart et al., 2017 38. Hart, T. ∙ Tong, A.H.Y. ∙ Chan, K. ... Evaluation and design of genome-wide CRISPR/SpCas9 knockout screens G3 (Bethesda). 2017; 7 :2719-2727 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, of the 90 genes targeted, only 16 were orthologous to the human CEGs, all of them harbored within the last 27 mouse genes in the heatmap (gCluster IV-V, Figure 4 D, pink text).
The biological relevance evident in the clustering pattern, together with the fact that only 20%–39% of the 3,510 data points represent unaltered events, suggests that in general, the guides in iMAP-100 were active and specific, just as those in iMAP-61. The insights emerging from the heatmap are cataloged below.
In this group of tissues (brain, heart, and eyeball), guide depletion was undetectable/weak except for gCluster V (g87-98), which was clearly depleted in all tissues, suggesting that g87–98 had hit CEGs. However, only five of the 12 mouse CEG candidates were orthologous to the CEGs identified in human tumor lines ( Figure 4 D, pink text in gCluster V), suggesting marked divergence between the two types of CEGs. Mammalian CEGs, of interest to tumor therapy and synthetic biology, are traditionally discovered in tumor lines ( Boone and Andrews, 2015 8. Boone, C. ∙ Andrews, B.J. Human genome. The indispensable genome Science. 2015; 350 :1028-1029 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), but iMAP enables their discovery in primary cells in mice, a physiological setting. Relevant literature on the 12 mouse genes is limited, but in agreement or compatible with our data. Thus, supporting our data, Akirin2 and Hcfc1 are essential for the survival/proliferation of various cell types examined ( Bosch et al., 2020 9. Bosch, P.J. ∙ Peek, S.L. ∙ Smolikove, S. ...

Mangone, M. ∙ Myers, M.P. ∙ Herr, W. Role of the HCF-1 basic region in sustaining cell proliferation PLoS One. 2010; 5 :e9020 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), Zpr1 for inner cell mass in blastocysts and neuron-like cells ( Gangwani et al., 2005 30.

Biol. 2005; 25 :2744-2756 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), Hspd1 for adult cardiomyocytes ( Fan et al., 2020a 28. Fan, F. ∙ Duan, Y. ∙ Yang, F. ... Deletion of heat shock protein 60 in adult mouse cardiomyocytes perturbs mitochondrial protein homeostasis and causes heart failure Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27 :587-600 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), Hspa9 for hematopoietic progenitor cells ( Liu et al., 2017 64.

Knockdown of HSPA9 induces TP53-dependent apoptosis in human hematopoietic progenitor cells PloS One. 2017; 12 :e0170470 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), MCRS1 and WTAP for human tumor lines ( Bansal et al., 2014 5.

Chem. 2012; 287 :22533-22548 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Nsrp1 for mature (single positive) thymocytes ( Kim et al., 2021 51. Kim, C.H. ∙ Park, S.M. ∙ Lee, S.J. ... NSrp70 is a lymphocyte-essential splicing factor that controls thymocyte development Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :5760-5778 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, Nsrp1 deletion fails to kill immature (DP) thymocytes, perhaps because the deletion, induced by CD4-Cre, starts too late so that 25% of the Nsrp1 protein persists in DP cells ( Figure 2 A in Kim et al., 2021 51. Kim, C.H. ∙ Park, S.M. ∙ Lee, S.J. ... NSrp70 is a lymphocyte-essential splicing factor that controls thymocyte development Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :5760-5778 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, shRNA-mediated Ddx24 knockdown in mouse embryonic fibroblasts fails to kill the fibroblasts, perhaps because of the persistence of substantial amounts of protein ( Figure 3 C in Ma et al., 2013 65. Ma, Z. ∙ Moore, R. ∙ Xu, X. ... DDX24 negatively regulates cytosolic RNA-mediated innate immune signaling PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 :e1003721 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas Mcm3ap KO fails to kill B cells, perhaps because in that study an alternatively spliced exon (E2) is floxed, while we targeted a conserved one (E9) ( Kuwahara et al., 2004 54. Kuwahara, K. ∙ Fujimura, S. ∙ Takahashi, Y. ... Germinal center-associated nuclear protein contributes to affinity maturation of B cell antigen receptor in T cell-dependent responses Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :1010-1015 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Of note, given that this group of tissues is relatively refractory to Cas9 cleavage, we suspect that some of the gCluster IV targets, particularly the subset of g77-86 with appreciable albeit marginal depletion, could have been scored as CEGs just like their human counterparts, were the perturbation more efficient. Interestingly, lentivirus-based genome-wide in situ CRISPR screen for neuronal essential genes hits only one of the 12 putative CEGs we identified ( Wertz et al., 2020 99. Wertz, M.H. ∙ Mitchem, M.R. ∙ Pineda, S.S. ... Genome-wide in vivo CNS screening identifies genes that modify CNS neuronal survival and mHTT toxicity Neuron. 2020; 106 :76-89 e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that iMAP is more sensitive than virus-based methods ( Figure S5 D).
Visceral adipose tissues at different depots seem functionally specialized ( Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014 85. Rosen, E.D. ∙ Spiegelman, B.M. What we talk about when we talk About fat Cell. 2014; 156 :20-44 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1461) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zwick et al., 2018 103. Zwick, R.K. ∙ Guerrero-Juarez, C.F. ∙ Horsley, V. ... Anatomical, physiological, and functional diversity of adipose tissue Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :68-83 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the murine pFat, lacking a human counterpart, has received little attention. We found that pFAT (T7) did not cluster with the highly related mesenteric fat (mFat, T11, Figure 4 D). Indeed, 17 guides were differentially represented, either due to preferential depletion in one of the two fat tissues (14 guides, green and red dots) or due to selective enrichment in pFat (g30, 31,35; Figure 4 H Top Plot 1 and Figure 4 F). The data offer a rare glimpse at pFat, whose behavior proved divergent from mFat.
We uncovered multiple putative regulators of B and T cells, including Derl1 and Hdac7 , with appealing potential for cancer treatment.
Derl1 , an oncogene driving various human tumors ( Fan et al., 2020b 29. Fan, J. ∙ Tian, L. ∙ Huang, S. ... Derlin-1 promotes the progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma via the activation of AKT pathway OncoTargets Ther. 2020; 13 :5407-5417 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), emerged as a highly specific positive regulator of B cell development/proliferation/survival: g Derl1 was depleted in B cells dramatically (22×) but unaffected in other somatic tissues ( Figure 4 G). DERL1 could potentially be a safe drug target for diverse cancers.
Regarding T cells, gCluster III–V guides were generally depleted across various immune cells but occasionally to different extents in different T cell subsets:
First, four guides (g49, 65, 67, as well as gCluster II g16) were differentially depleted in Tregs versus naive CD4 cells ( Figure 4 H, Top Plot 2). The two T cell subsets are closely related and develop from the same precursor (DP thymocytes); this lineage bifurcation could be impacted by the four genes.
Second, differential depletion was also seen between naive versus differentiated T cells. Upon antigen stimulation, naive CD4 and CD8 cells become activated and develop into effector or memory T cells, the latter including central memory (CM) and effector memory cells. The CM T cells are marked by CD44 hi CD62L hi , whereas the effectors and effector memory cells both by CD44 hi CD62L low and collectively termed effector/memory (E/M) T cells. Understanding the mechanisms regulating T cell activation and differentiation is crucial for cancer immunotherapy based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, the CD4/CD8 T cells expressing CARs recognizing tumor antigens ( Lim and June, 2017 63. Lim, W.A. ∙ June, C.H. The principles of engineering immune cells to treat Cancer Cell. 2017; 168 :724-740 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (649) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found 18 guides significantly enriched in E/M relative to naive CD8 cells (red dots), four of them (g27, 76, 80, and 81) also significantly enriched in CM relative to naive CD8 cells ( Figure 4 H, Top Plots 3–4), suggesting that the shared guides had perturbed fundamental negative regulators of activation and memory formation of CD8 cells. This effect is absent in CD4 cells, highlighting its specificity ( Figure 4 H, Top Plot 5). We hypothesized that the negative regulators of CD8 cells could be exploited to potentiate CAR T therapy. To test this, we focused on HDAC7 because g27- Hdac7 was robustly enriched in both E/M and CM CD8 cells. Indeed, deleting HDAC7 in human HER2 CAR T cells targeting breast cancer cells did not compromise their viability but substantially enhanced their cytokine secretion and tumor killing in vitro ( Figures 5 A and 5D). Interestingly, g27- Hdac7 was unaltered in vital organs ( Figure 5 E), suggesting that it might be safe to use HDAC7 small-molecule inhibitors ( Mak et al., 2021 67. Mak, J.Y.W. ∙ Wu, K.-C. ∙ Gupta, P.K. ... HDAC7 inhibition by phenacetyl and phenylbenzoyl hydroxamates J. Med. Chem. 2021; 64 :2186-2204 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ) to activate the endogenous CD8 T cells in situ . Of note, like g27- Hdac7 , g35- Tsc2 was also enriched in E/M and CM relative to naive CD8 ( Figure 4 H, Top Plots 3–4), supporting the report that Tsc2 KO promotes CD44 hi CD62L low CD8 cell accumulation ( Pollizzi et al., 2015 76. Pollizzi, K.N. ∙ Patel, C.H. ∙ Sun, I.-H. ... mTORC1 and mTORC2 selectively regulate CD8+ T cell differentiation J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :2090-2108 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, Tsc2 KO impairs effector memory CD8 cell formation, thus unfit for enhancing CAR T therapy ( Pollizzi et al., 2015 76. Pollizzi, K.N. ∙ Patel, C.H. ∙ Sun, I.-H. ... mTORC1 and mTORC2 selectively regulate CD8+ T cell differentiation J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :2090-2108 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ).
This cluster comprised germ cells at various stages of spermatogenesis. A key finding is that spermatogonia were exceptional:
First, spermatogonia were far more vulnerable than their progeny: except for g2- Morf4l2 , all the 90 targeting guides were altered, mostly of them at least 2× (88 depleted and g72- Adar enriched) in spermatogonia ( Figure 4 H, Bottom Plot 1), but no further alteration was seen in the progeny except for 19 guides whose depletion was exacerbated 2–8× in pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes ( Figure 4 H, bottom plots 2–4). In other words, the 89 guides perturbed (mostly blocked) spermatogonia survival/proliferation/renewal, but only 19 of them additionally impacted (spermatogonia differentiation into) primary spermatocytes, and none disrupted the downstream steps. The 19 genes regulating primary spermatocytes include Mov10 (a highly selective regulator of spermatogenesis; see below) and Dnmt1 (the maintenance DNA methyltransferase), the latter known to promote homologous chromosome pairing during meiotic prophase and survival of pachytene spermatocytes, in line with our data ( Takada et al., 2021 92. Takada, Y. ∙ Yaman-Deveci, R. ∙ Shirakawa, T. ... Maintenance DNA methylation in pre-meiotic germ cells regulates meiotic prophase by facilitating homologous chromosome pairing Development. 2021; 148 :dev194605 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Second, spermatogonia were more vulnerable than somatic cells in that gCluster II was preferentially depleted in spermatogonia. In particular, g11- Mov10 and g24- Mfn2 , whose target genes are widely expressed but dispensable for somatic cell survival ( Chen et al., 2007 14. Chen, H. ∙ McCaffery, J.M. ∙ Chan, D.C. Mitochondrial fusion protects against neurodegeneration in the cerebellum Cell. 2007; 130 :548-562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dorn, 2020 25. Dorn, G.W. Mitofusin 2 dysfunction and disease in mice and men Front. Physiol. 2020; 11 :782 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Goodier et al., 2012 34. Goodier, J.L. ∙ Cheung, L.E. ∙ Kazazian, H.H. MOV10 RNA helicase is a potent inhibitor of retrotransposition in cells PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002941 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ; Skariah et al., 2017 90. Skariah, G. ∙ Seimetz, J. ∙ Norsworthy, M. ... Mov10 suppresses retroelements and regulates neuronal development and function in the developing brain BMC Biol. 2017; 15 :54 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), were largely unaltered in somatic cells as expected, but depleted dramatically (33–37×) in the germ cells ( Figure 4 G) via impacting spermatogonia ( Figure 4 H, bottom). Mov10 encodes an RNA helicase capable of suppressing retroelements, whereas Mfn2 regulates mitochondria. Thus, both genes regulate general cellular processes, making their selective essentiality in spermatogonia intriguing. Unexpectedly, g13- Prkacb and g20- Prkaca were also depleted albeit only mildly (∼3×, p = 0.05 and 0.06, respectively), in conflict with the report that spermatogenesis is normal in global Prkacb KO mice and only marginally compromised in global Prkaca KO mice (sperm counts reduced from 16.2 to 12.9 million/testis) ( Skålhegg et al., 2002 89. Skålhegg, B.S. ∙ Huang, Y. ∙ Su, T. ... Mutation of the Calpha subunit of PKA leads to growth retardation and sperm dysfunction Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16 :630-639 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Perhaps the global KO can trigger some compensatory change that obscures the mild testicular phenotype. Also unexpected is that g22- Dnmt3b was moderately depleted (5×, p = 0.001), although germline specific KO of Dnmt3b (but not of Dnmt3a ) is inconsequential ( Kaneda et al., 2004 48. Kaneda, M. ∙ Okano, M. ∙ Hata, K. ... Essential role for de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a in paternal and maternal imprinting Nature. 2004; 429 :900-903 Crossref Scopus (1028) PubMed Google Scholar ). This discrepancy is hard to reconcile but might be rooted in the timing of KO (D10–20 in our study versus E14.5 in the previous one). Of note, g22- Dnmt3b depletion was far less dramatic than g79 -Dnmt1 (5× versus 30×, p = 0.00001; Figure 4 H Bottom Plot 1), supporting the importance of DNA methylation maintenance in adults.
In conclusion, we found spermatogonia unusual among all the tissues examined and identified multiple potential regulators of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes.
Figure 1 D depicts a breeding scheme for generating constitutive single-KO lines via inheritance of the KO allele from mosaic KO males. A more flexible alternative would be to first derive the offspring expressing mono-guides, which would enable constitutive or conditional KO using proper Cas9 lines. The derivation process is predicted to be efficient. For example, sampling a 200-pup pool should recover, with near 100% probabilities, 35 and 50 distinct mono-guide lines from 61-guide; Cre and 100-guide; Cre fathers, respectively ( Figure 6 A).
To test the idea, we mated TAM-treated 61-guide; Cre males with WT B6 females. From 15 pups, we obtained 11 mono-guide lines, their composition expectedly resembling that of the paternal P0 guides ( Figures 6 B and 6C); this scenario was predicted to occur with a probability of 44%. To verify the functionality of the mono-guides, we introduced CAG-Cas9 into a line expressing g48- Cd45 and examined the targeted Cd45 Exon 7 in the tail DNA. A single out-of-frame indel comprising a 6-nt deletion and a 1-nt insertion was predominant ( Figure S6 A, top), demonstrating efficient editing. Interestingly, the mutant exon was skipped in Cd45 mRNA ( Figure S6 A, bottom and S6B), resulting in only a marginal decrease in CD45 expression ( Figure S6 C).
We have similarly used the 100-guide; Cre males to generate diverse mono-guide lines, obtaining 28 lines from 68 pups sampled ( Figure 6 D), an outcome with a predicted probability of 100%. These lines are intended for conditional KO, to be achieved using a CAG-Lox-Stop-Lox-Cas9 transgene in conjunction with tissue-specific Cre lines. As expected, the mono-guides were highly refractory to Cre, ensuring that Cre is safe to use ( Figure S6 D).

Section: Discussion

The advent of iMAP has set the stage for profiling the effects of the perturbations of the 20,000 protein-coding genes throughout the mouse body preferably at the single-cell level. This is feasible because iMAP is scalable (via making additional lines) and compatible with single-cell omics technologies ( Mimitou et al., 2019 71. Mimitou, E.P. ∙ Cheng, A. ∙ Montalbano, A. ...

This project would be large, but the scale will perhaps pale in comparison with that of the campaign launched by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, which comprises 21 research institutions and seeks to perform KO and basic phenotyping for each of the 20,000 genes, an endeavor involving tens of thousands of KO mouse lines and decades of labor by hundreds of participants ( https://www.mousephenotype.org/about-impc/ ).
First, iMAP is applicable to small-scale in situ CRISPR screens, with distinctive advantages over the conventional virus-based strategy, as outlined in the introduction . Notably, in vivo virus-based screens have often been performed at scales befitting iMAP (11–120 target genes), regardless of whether the readout is differential gRNA representation or single-cell transcriptomes/chromatin accessibility (Perturb-seq/ATAC) ( Adamson et al., 2016 1.

Adv. 2018; 4 :eaao5508 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, iMAP does have a notable weakness compared with the virus-based strategy: altering the guide composition entails the generation of new iMAP lines, which is not trivial. We recommend that when generating iMAP lines, priority be given to the lines that are repetitively useful (such as those targeting widely expressed enzymes or implicated in diverse diseases), thus maximizing the payoff. The second utility of iMAP is the rapid, cost-effective derivation of single-KO lines via simple breeding. Select KO lines can be used for validation and in-depth exploration of the candidate genes initially identified in the mosaic parents. The KO lines can also be screened as a pool for systemic, organism-level phenotypes ( Bai et al., 2019 4. Bai, M. ∙ Han, Y. ∙ Wu, Y. ... Targeted genetic screening in mice through haploid embryonic stem cells identifies critical genes in bone development PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000350 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kile and Hilton, 2005 50. Kile, B.T. ∙ Hilton, D.J. The art and design of genetic screens: mouse Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6 :557-567 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, iMAP should be applicable to other multicellular organisms and to other CRISPR platforms, such as CRISPRa for gene activation, CRISPRi for gene silencing, base editors for installing point mutations, and Cas13 for RNA knockdown, the latter ideal for interrogating noncoding RNAs. Finally, iMAP should also be useful for illuminating the noncoding genome.
iMAP has room for improvement on three fronts. First, the 100-guide throughput is reasonable for Perturb-Atlas mapping and small-scale in situ screening but insufficient for large-scale CRISPR screens. One countermeasure is to breed several iMAP transgenes into the same mice. Second, the P0 guide representation is biased toward the proximal guides, which might be alleviated by fine-tuning the array configuration. Finally, the one guide per target design is prone to artifacts, which can be minimized by leveraging xCas9 (the Cas9 variant highly intolerant of mismatches) and prevalidating gRNAs using high-throughput assays ( Kim et al., 2020 52. Kim, H.K. ∙ Lee, S. ∙ Kim, Y. ... High-throughput analysis of the activities of xCas9, SpCas9-NG and SpCas9 at matched and mismatched target sequences in human cells Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2020; 4 :111-124 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We noted three gross phenotypes. The first is the thymoma in iMAP-61, caused mainly by Pten deficiency ( Figure 3 B) and dominated with CD4+CD8+ (DP) cells ( Figure S3 B). Human thymomas are heterogeneous, a subset of them also dominated by DP cells ( Girard, 2013 32. Girard, N. Thymic epithelial tumours: from basic principles to individualised treatment strategies Eur. Respir. Rev. 2013; 22 :75-87 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), but whether this DP-rich subset can be caused by PTEN -deficiency remains unclear. The second is the polycystic kidney in iMAP-100, caused by Tsc2 perturbation. In agreement, TSC2 mutations in humans cause Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, a multi-organ disease associated with polycystic kidney in 50% of the patients ( Rosset et al., 2017 87. Rosset, C. ∙ Netto, C.B.O. ∙ Ashton-Prolla, P. TSC1 and TSC2 gene mutations and their implications for treatment in tuberous sclerosis Complex: a review Genet. Mol. Biol. 2017; 40 :69-79 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final major gross abnormality is the testicular atrophy in iMAP-100 caused by perturbations of many of the targeted genes in iMAP-100, but we are not aware of reports on testicular phenotypes associated with the mutations in any of these genes in humans.
Tissues relatively refractory to Cas9 cleavage (such as brain and heart) are prone to false negatives, which we have only begun to address ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Specifically, we examined potential indels induced by three guides (g Chd8 , g Jup , and g Dnmt1 ) in iMAP-100. These guides were unaltered in the brain and heart ( Figure 4 D) and well-represented, given their proximal location (P2–5, Figure S4 G), thus facilitating the analysis. In the brain, the cleavage was indeed inefficient for all three genes (20%–67%, translating to 4%–45% biallelic mutations; Figure S5 E), precluding evaluation of their essentiality. Cleavage was far more efficient in the heart, reaching 100% at Jup , suggesting that Jup is dispensable for heart cell survival, compatible with the report that Jup deficiency causes only focal myocyte losses ( Li et al., 2011 61. Li, J. ∙ Swope, D. ∙ Raess, N. ... Cardiac tissue-restricted deletion of plakoglobin results in progressive cardiomyopathy and activation of {beta}-catenin signaling Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31 :1134-1144 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). The indel frequency at Dnmt1 in the heart was 80%, suggesting Dnmt1 is also largely dispensable for heart cell survival. Finally, Chd8 cleavage in the heart (60%) was too inefficient for evaluating the biological consequence. Overall, the upper limits for false positives and false negatives were 0.9%–2% and 20%–39%, respectively ( Figure 4 E), but the actual rates are presumably much lower, as demonstrated in iMAP-61. CRISPRi, compatible with iMAP, seems highly efficient in the brain ( Duke et al., 2020 27. Duke, C.G. ∙ Bach, S.V. ∙ Revanna, J.S. ... An improved CRISPR/dCas9 interference tool for neuronal gene suppression Front. Genome Ed. 2020; 2 :9 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), offering an attractive alternative for mapping the Perturb-Atlas in the brain.

Plasmids carrying the 61- or 100-guide transgene are available from Addgene (#187460 and #187461). iMAP lines can be released via a Material Transfer Agreement.
To generate the 61-guide and 100-guide transgenic lines, we designed candidate guides using CRISPick and selected those likely to induce out-of-frame indels using inDelphi. Guide sequences together with the CRISPick attributes are listed in Tables S1.1 and S2.1 . The transgenes were assembled using Golden-Gate cloning ( Figure S1 E), and their sequences available at https://github.com/Jing-Zhengyu/Data-of-iMAP . To insert the transgenes into the mouse genome, the piggyBac (PB) vectors carrying the transgenes were co-injected into the C57/B6 zygotes with PBase mRNA. The founders were identified by PCR and then mated with WT mice to derive the lines bearing single-copy transgenes. Inverse PCR revealed that the 61-guide transgene was inserted at Chr1:188500759(-), whereas the two 100-guide lines at Chr1:13111679 (-) and Chr14: 73285884 (+), respectively; the coordinates are based on Mouse Genome (mm10). To generate iMAP mice, we introduced the CAG-Cas9 (JAX # 028555) and Ubc-CreER (JAX # 007179) transgenes into the 61-guide and 100-guide transgenic lines. The mice (males and females) were treated with tamoxifen (TAM) on Day 10 and analyzed months later. Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at ShanghaiTech, and performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines.
iMAP is deceptively simple; it is in fact fraught with pitfalls, as detailed in a preprint ( Chen et al., 2020 15. Chen, Y. ∙ Sun, J. ∙ Mao, S. ... Novel mosaic mice with diverse applications Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Briefly, an initial version of the iMAP transgenes was designed that resembles that depicted in Figure 1 , but with two key differences. First, instead of LoxTC9, we used LoxKR3, a LoxP variant carrying some mutations at the right repeat; LoxKR3 can efficiently recombine with Lox71, and the ensuing double mutant is inactive ( Araki et al., 2010 3. Araki, K. ∙ Okada, Y. ∙ Araki, M. ... Comparative analysis of right element mutant lox sites on recombination efficiency in embryonic stem cells BMC Biotechnol. 2010; 10 :29 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, the transgene was inserted into the H11 locus, a safe harbor for transgene expression, which would ensure robust U6 promoter activity in diverse tissues ( Chi et al., 2019 17. Chi, X. ∙ Zheng, Q. ∙ Jiang, R. ... A system for site-specific integration of transgenes in mammalian cells PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0219842 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unfortunately, the results were unexpected.
First, the double mutant resulting from Lox71-KR3 recombination remained highly active. This prompted us to conduct extensive mutagenesis of LoxP, leading to the discovery of LoxTC9 capable of rather efficient recombination with Lox71 but producing severely disabled double mutant ( Figure S1 A–D).
Second, the P0 guide was poorly expressed when the transgenes were integrated into the H11 locus, whereas much higher expression was achievable for transgenes randomly integrated into the genome using the piggyBac transposon. Since the H11 locus has been previously tested only for Pol II promoters rather than the Pol III-transcribed U6 promoter, the “safe harbors” for the two types of promoters may be distinct. Indeed, a U6 promoter inserted into Rosa26 locus, the widely used harbor for Pol II promoters, was also hardly active ( Chen et al., 2020 15. Chen, Y. ∙ Sun, J. ∙ Mao, S. ... Novel mosaic mice with diverse applications Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We have thus resorted to piggyBac for transgenesis.
Tail DNA (100 ng) was digested with 0.5 μL Dpn II (NEB) at 37℃ for 1 hr in a 10-μL reaction before heat inactivation at 80℃. One μL of the digestion reaction was ligated with 0.4 μL T4 ligase (NEB) in a 10-μL reaction for 2 hr. The ligation product (1 μL) was subjected to two sets of inverse PCR (10-μL reaction containing KOD, dUTP and UDG) amplifying the 5' and 3' insertion sites, respectively. The PCR parameters are: 37℃ 10 m, 98℃ 3 m, then 35 cycles of 98℃ 10 s, 60℃ 10 s and 68℃ 15 s, followed by extension at 68℃ 2 m. The PCR products were resolved on a gel to visualize the amplicon, and 1 μL of the samples, diluted up to 100-fold depending on amplicon abundance, was subjected to nested PCR in a 30 μL reaction containing AceTaq and dUTP at 95℃ 5 m, 35 cycles of 95℃ 30 s, 50℃ 30 s, 72℃ 1 m, final extension at 72℃ 5 m. The amplicons from the nested PCR were Sanger-sequenced and mapped to the Mouse Genome (mm10). Finally, we verified the integration sites by PCR using the primer pairs targeting the transgenes and the adjacent host genomic sequences. The primers are in Table S3 (sheet 1).
We have successfully amplified a 61-guide array in its entirety in early trials ( Chen et al., 2020 15. Chen, Y. ∙ Sun, J. ∙ Mao, S. ... Novel mosaic mice with diverse applications Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), but the PCR proved not robust enough. Thus, we have resorted to amplification of sub-arrays comprising fewer than 30 guides. To this end, tail DNA (50 ng) was amplified in 10-μL touchdown PCR using KOD OneTM PCR Master Mix-Blue with the following parameters: 5 cycles of 98℃ 10 s, 74℃ 30 s, 5 cycles of 98℃ 10 s, 72℃ 30 s, 5 cycles of 98℃ 10 s, 70℃ 30 s, 20 cycles of 98℃ 10 s, 68℃ 30 s. The primers are in Table S3 (sheet 2).
Mouse tail or toe clips were lysed in the lysis buffer from the One Step Mouse Genotyping Kit (Vanzyme). One ul lysate was subjected to multiplex PCR to co-amplify fragments from 61 - or 100-guide array, Ubc-CreER and CAG-Cas9 . The primers are in Table S3 (sheet 3).
We prepared 50 mg/mL stock solutions by adding 500 mg TAM (Medchem Express) to 10 mL corn oil (Medchem Express) before adding 1 mL EtOH, which can be stored at -80℃ for six months. Before use, the solution was incubated at 50℃ for 30 min to dissolve TAM, and delivered via intragastric administration into adults (0.2 mg/g daily for 1-3 days) or D10 mice (0.1 mg/g daily for three days, followed by 0.2 mg/g daily for three days) unless otherwise specified.
Organs were harvested from 61-guide; Cas9 and 100-guide; Cas9 adults, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in Trizol reagent. RNA was then extracted using Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research) and reverse-transcribed using HiScript® II Q RT SuperMix (Vazyme). gRNA expression was quantified using Luna® Universal qPCR Master Mix (NEB), with Actb serving the internal control. The primers were in Table S3 (sheet 4).
For DNA isolation from solid organs, minced organ samples (10-50 mg) were first incubated at 55℃ overnight in 4 mL of Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 8) containing 400 μg Proteinase K (Sangon Biotech). DNA in 500 μL of digestion reaction was then extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. DNA in FACS-sorted cells was isolated using the DNA Microprep kit (Zymo Research). For sperm DNA isolation, mature sperm was released from cauda epididymis, pelleted by centrifugation at 500x g for 5 m and resuspended in 71 μL PBS and 100 μL sperm lysis buffer (20 mM Tris·Cl pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 4% SDS, with 4 μL of 2 M DTT and 25 μL of 10 mg/mL Proteinase K freshly added before use). The samples were shaken vigorously at 55℃ for 2 hr before DNA isolation using the DNA Microprep kit (Zymo Research).
Genomic DNA from various organs was treated with bisulfite (EZ DNA methylation kits, ZymoResearch) and the U6 promoter sequence amplified using two rounds of PCR before Sanger sequencing. The first-round PCR was performed using KOD (98℃ 3 m, 35 cycles of 98℃ 10 s, 50℃ 10 s, 68℃ 30 s, then 68℃ 1 m), while the second round AceTaq (95℃ 30 s, 35 cycles of 95℃ 30 s, 48℃ 40 s, 72℃ 40 s, then 72℃ 7 m). The amplicons were Sanger-sequenced, and the extents of methylation determined using SangerseqR in R. The primers are in Table S3 (sheet 5).
The various guides at P0 were amplified and sequencing library subsequently prepared using three rounds of PCRs (primers in Table S3 (sheet 6)).
For PCR#1, genomic DNA extracted as described above was used as the template. P0 guide representation was not even, the least abundant guide comprising only ∼0.1% and ∼0.05% of the total P0 guides in the 61-guide and 100-guide transgene, respectively, even after rather extensive recombination. To ensure sufficient coverage of the underrepresentated guides, 0.6 and 1.2 μg genomic DNA from iMAP-61 and iMAP-100, corresponding to 0.1 and 0.2 million cells respectively, was used in PCR, achieving >100x coverage for all the guides. PCR was performed using NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix (NEB) in a 25-μL reaction containing UDG (0.05 μL, 5U/μL) using the primer pair recognizing the U6 promoter and the common scaffold sequence in the guides ( Figure 1 A). The cycling parameters are 98℃ 30 s, 26 cycles of 98℃ 10 s, 65℃ 30 s, and 65℃ 5 m. The PCR products were checked on the gel. If a 246-bp band (representing the P0 guides) was predominant, which is usually the case, the samples were directly used as the template for PCR#2, which should produce a single strong 228-bp band. Otherwise, the 246-bp band from PCR#1 was gel-isolated before PCR#2.
PCR#2 adds bar-coded primers by amplifying 0.5 μL of PCR#1 reaction with AceTaq (Vazyme) in a 25-μL reaction. To avoid carry-over contamination and prevent future contamination, dUTP (4 nM, together with 2 nM MgCl 2 ) and UDG (0.05 μL, 5U/μL) were added to the reaction. The cycling parameters were: 37℃ 10 m, 95℃ 5 m, 16 cycles of 95℃ 30 s, 55℃ 30 s, 72℃ 20 s, and 72℃ 5 m.
PCR#3 adds an index to the amplicons. To this end, 1 μL of PCR#2 reaction was amplified using AceTaq in the presence of dUTP (4 nM, together with 2 nM MgCl 2 ). The cycling condition was: 95℃ 5 m, 16 cycles of 95℃ 30 s, 55℃ 30 s, 72℃ 20 s, and 72℃ 5 m. The PCR products from various organs were pooled before sequencing on Illumina Novaseq 6000 (PE150) at a depth of at least 0.5 million reads per sample.
In our method, dUTP was used to make the amplicons from PCR#2/3 susceptible to UDG digestion, and UDG to prevent these amplicons from contaminating ongoing PCR#1/2.
The NGS raw reads described above were qualitychecked with FastQC (0.11.8) and demultiplexed with Cutadapt (2.7). To extract the 20-bp spacer sequences from the reads, we removed their flanking sequences using Cutadapt (2.7) under the setting “-g ‘GCCTTGTTTG...GTTTAAGAGC’ -G ‘GCTCTTAAAC...CAAACAAGGC’ -j 5 --trimmed-only”. We next established a gRNA library index using the Index command in Salmon (1.3.0) under the setting “-k 17”. The spacer sequences were then mapped to this index using the Quant command in Salmon (1.3.0). To compare guide abundance across different samples, we used the “size factor” to normalize the raw reads, taking advantage of the multiple reference guides engineered into the transgenes (namely g Cd19 for the 61-guide and gNC for the 100-guide ) ( Li et al., 2014 62. Li, W. ∙ Xu, H. ∙ Xiao, T. ... MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :554 Crossref Scopus (909) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we first calculate the geometric mean for each reference guide across all the samples, which is then used to normalize the reads of respective reference guides in a sample. The size factor is the median of the normalized reads of the multiple reference guides in that sample: S 𝑖 = m e d i a n { X 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 ̂ X 𝑗 } , where S 𝑖 is the size factor for a particular sample i, ̂ X 𝑗 the geometrical mean of a particular reference guide j, and X 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 the raw reads of guide j in sample i. The normalized reads of the guides targeting the genes in the experimental group in sample i are calculated by dividing the raw reads of these guides with S 𝑖 . The normalized reads of a particular guide were used to calculate Fold-changes, defined as the reads count of this guide in an iMAP tissue ( guide; Cre; Cas9 ) divided by the averaged reads count in the control ( guide; Cre ), the latter pooled from multiple samples with comparable extents of recombination to the iMAP tissue, which was intended to cancel out random sample-to-sample variations in the control. Reads normalization and Fold-change calculation were performed using homemade scripts based largely on tidyverse in R (4.1), which was visualized as heatmaps using pheatmap. To cluster the various guides and tissues according to their fold-changes, we first used the dist function to calculate Euclidean distances between the guides and tissues, and then used the Complete Method in hclust to determine their clustering trees. All these analyses were done in R (4.1) using a home-made script package ( https://github.com/Jing-Zhengyu/iMAP ).
We amplified 300- to 700-bp regions encompassing the sites targeted by gRNAs using 50 ng genomic DNA templates (primers in Table S3 (sheet 7)). The amplicons were then sequenced using the Sanger method ( Figures 2 D and S4 C) or NGS ( Figure S5 E). Sanger sequencing data were analyzed using ICE ( https://www.synthego.com ). For NGS, the library was constructed and sequenced as described for P0 guides. The reads were analyzed by CRISPResso2 using default settings to determine the abundance of the edits, which was normalized to the abundance of the corresponding guides in order to yield the indel frequencies in the cells expressing the guides.
Bulk RNA-seq was used to analyze a thymoma from iMAP-61 together with three age-matched WT control. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent, and 1 μg RNA was used for mRNA isolation and library construction employing the NEBNext® Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module and NEBNext® Ultra™ II mRNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina, respectively. Following quality control using D1000 Screen Tape and KAPA Library Quant kit (illumina) universal qPCR Mix, which evaluates DNA sizes and concentrations, respectively, the libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (PE 150). Raw reads were quality-checked with FastQC, the index was built with GenomeGenerate and then mapped to mm10 using STAR. Read counts were obtained using featureCounts and DEGs identified using exactTest in edgeR (biological coefficient of variation set at 0.2) for the genes whose expression was above the cut-off level (> 5 counts per million in at least two of the four samples). Functional enrichment was analyzed at g:Profiler, where the p-value was adjusted using g:SCS and the terms comprised 10-500 genes. Only the upregulated genes were analyzed; the downregulated genes were mostly immune-related and not further pursued. The indels at Pten mRNA were identified using mpileup in Samtools set at -q20 -Q 20.
To analyze the scRNA-seq data previously deposited ( Pankaew et al., 2022 73. Pankaew, S. ∙ Potier, D. ∙ Grosjean, C. ... Calcium signaling is impaired in PTEN-deficient T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Front. Immunol. 2022; 13 , 797244 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), the matrix file in GSE186498 was generated using CellRanger before analysis with the Seurat package. Hashtag oligos (HTOs) counts for each cell were normalized using a centered log ratio (CLR) transformation and the samples demultiplexed using HTODemux. Doublets and empty droplets were removed as were low-quality data points, the latter defined as the cells with UMI<500, the cells expressing <200 genes and/or the genes expressed in <10 cells. The raw counts were normalized using NormalizeData in Seurat before DEG identification with Wilcox (FindMarkers).
Thymus (including those with thymoma) and lymph nodes were crushed over 40-μm cell strainers to prepare single-cell suspension. The antibodies used are listed in the key resources table . FACS analysis of testicular cells was performed as described ( Gaysinskaya et al., 2014 31. Gaysinskaya, V. ∙ Soh, I.Y. ∙ van der Heijden, G.W. ... Optimized flow cytometry isolation of murine spermatocytes Cytometry A. 2014; 85 :556-565 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, testicles were stripped of the fibrous membrane and rocked gently in 5 mL PBS containing collagenase IV at 32℃ for 10 m. 4 mL of the digestion buffer were then removed before adding 9 mL of PBS containing pancreas and DNase I (0.5 mg). Incubation was continued for 5 m, during which the tube was inverted 30 times before adding 0.5 mL FBS and 0.5 mg DNase I. The sample was inverted multiple times before filtration over 70-μm cell strainers to obtain single-cell suspension. The cells (∼50 million per testis) were pelleted by centrifugation at 500xg for 4 m and resuspended in DMEM at 1 million/mL. Hoechst (5 μg/million cells) and DNase I (50 μg/million cells) were then added. The cells were stained at 32℃ for 30 m while vortexed slowly (60 RPM), pelleted (500x g for 4 m), resuspended with 1 mL DMEM containing 2% FBS and 10 g/mL DNase I and then diluted with the same media to 10 million/mL before FACS. Analytical FACS and electronic purification were performed using FACS Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and Aria III (BD Biosciences), respectively, and the data analyzed using Flowjo.
The experiment was carried out as described ( Zou et al., 2022 102. Zou, Y. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Li, L. ... IKZF3 deficiency potentiates chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting solid tumors Cancer Lett. 2022; 524 :121-130 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, PBMCs were nucleofected with a cocktail of four vectors expressing HER2-CAR, PBase, Cas9 and an HDAC7 gRNA, respectively. Control CAR T cells were generated in parallel by omitting the Cas9 and gRNA vectors. CAR-T cells were expanded using irradiated allogeneic PBMCs, an anti-CD3 antibody and IL-2, and selected with puromycin. The expanded cells were incubated for 24 h with the breast cancer line MDA-MB-453 expressing firefly luciferase. Cytokine expression was measured using the PerkinElmer AlphaLISA Kit. Tumor lysis was evaluated based on intracellular luciferase activity measured using EnVision® Multimode Plate Reader, the formula being: tumor lysis (%) = 100% × (1 – signal co-culture experiment/signal tumor alone).
Mean values are displayed in the volcano plots and heatmaps, and mean±SD in the bar graphs. Replicate numbers are specified for each condition, and Two-Sample Student’s t-test was used to calculate the p values except in Fig4 F (One-Sample t-test), Figure S3 E (Wilcoxon test) and Figure S5 C (One Way ANOVA). Statistic significance is indicated with asterisks: ∗ p<0.05, ∗∗ p<0.01, ∗∗∗ p<0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p<0.0001. Data analysis was performed in R (4.1).
