Title: Direct Tumor Killing and Immunotherapy through Anti-SerpinB9 Therapy


Abstract: Summary

Cancer therapies kill tumors either directly or indirectly by evoking immune responses and have been combined with varying levels of success. Here, we describe a paradigm to control cancer growth that is based on both direct tumor killing and the triggering of protective immunity. Genetic ablation of serine protease inhibitor SerpinB9 (Sb9) results in the death of tumor cells in a granzyme B (GrB)-dependent manner. Sb9-deficient mice exhibited protective T cell-based host immunity to tumors in association with a decline in GrB-expressing immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Maximal protection against tumor development was observed when the tumor and host were deficient in Sb9. The therapeutic utility of Sb9 inhibition was demonstrated by the control of tumor growth, resulting in increased survival times in mice. Our studies describe a molecular target that permits a combination of tumor ablation, interference within the TME, and immunotherapy in one potential modality.

Section: Introduction

Serine proteases participate in a wide range of physiological processes, which are regulated by a large family of peptidase inhibitors referred to as serine protease inhibitors (serpins) ( Silverman et al., 2001 47.

Evolution, mechanism of inhibition, novel functions, and a revised nomenclature J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :33293-33296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Serpins act as a suicide substrate for a serine protease that results in a characteristic covalent inhibitory complex ( Huntington et al., 2000 17. Huntington, J.A. ∙ Read, R.J. ∙ Carrell, R.W.

In contrast to most serpins, which are extracellular, SerpinB9 (Sb9) (PI9 in human, Spi6 in mice) is a member of the ovalbumin family of serpins, which reside within the nuclei and cytoplasm of cells ( Bird et al., 1998 5.

Chem. 1997; 272 :15434-15441 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sb9 proteins are physiological inhibitors of granzyme B (GrB), which triggers apoptosis by activating caspases-3 and -8, following delivery into target cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes (CLs) ( Pinkoski et al., 2001 41.

Chem. 2001; 276 :12060-12067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sb9 has been shown to protect pro-inflammatory CLs from self-inflicted damage by their own GrB ( Hirst et al., 2003 15. Hirst, C.E. ∙ Buzza, M.S. ∙ Bird, C.H. ...

Sb9 also protects other leukocytes, which are both pro-inflammatory (dendritic cells and neutrophils) ( Medema et al., 2001b 35. Medema, J.P. ∙ Schuurhuis, D.H. ∙ Rea, D. ...

Sb9 is also thought to protect tumor cells from GrB delivered by CLs, but this has not been tested directly in vivo ( Bots and Medema, 2008 6. Bots, M. ∙ Medema, J.P. Serpins in T cell immunity J.

Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of GrB in some cancer cells, but additional functional and comprehensive in vivo studies need to be performed ( D’Eliseo et al., 2010 9.

Immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), MDSCs, and Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) abet tumor progression and metastasis ( Kumar et al., 2016 26. Kumar, V. ∙ Patel, S. ∙ Tcyganov, E. ...

The immunosuppressive tumour network: myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells and natural killer T cells Immunology. 2013; 138 :105-115 Crossref Scopus (627) PubMed Google Scholar ). The potential effect of GrB inhibition by Sb9 on both the anti-tumor cellular effectors (such as CL) and immunosuppressive components of the TME is not known ( Quail and Joyce, 2013 44. Quail, D.F. ∙ Joyce, J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1423-1437 Crossref Scopus (5607) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aside from the potential for immunomodulation, whether inhibition of Sb9 results in beneficial elimination of tumors either by direct killing or by increased host immunity remains to be determined. In addition to its implications on immune cells and the intrinsic survival of tumor cells, the Sb9-GrB axis can also have a major impact on the tumor stroma as well. Stromal cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), constitute a major cellular component of the diverse TME and play a critical role in tumor development ( Kalluri, 2016 19. Kalluri, R. The biology and function of fibroblasts in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :582-598 Crossref Scopus (2821) PubMed Google Scholar ; Quail and Joyce, 2013 44. Quail, D.F. ∙ Joyce, J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1423-1437 Crossref Scopus (5607) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stromal cells can create an optimal milieu by producing numerous growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that promote tumor growth ( Nilendu et al., 2018 37. Nilendu, P. ∙ Sarode, S.C. ∙ Jahagirdar, D. ... Mutual concessions and compromises between stromal cells and cancer cells: driving tumor development and drug resistance Cell Oncol. (Dordr.). 2018; 41 :353-367 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2018 56. Wei, L. ∙ Ye, H. ∙ Li, G. ... Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote progression and gemcitabine resistance via the SDF-1/SATB-1 pathway in pancreatic cancer Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :1065 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we show that genetic ablation of Sb9 sensitized tumors to killing by not only CL-derived GrB, but also from endogenously produced GrB, which together resulted in the control of cancer in mice. The role of Sb9 in the anti-tumor host response was examined in Sb9 KO mice, which exhibited increased resistance to tumors. This was a consequence of impaired survival of immunosuppressive TAMs, MDSCs, Tregs, and CAFs in the TME that resulted in increased activity of anti-tumor CL. We developed a specific small molecule inhibitor of Sb9 and showed that treatment of mice could control tumor growth through direct sensitization to GrB and the activation of protective immunity.

Section: Results

We examined the expression of Sb9 and GrB in several tumors of human and mouse. Sb9 ( Figure 1 A) and GrB ( Figure 1 B) were expressed in primary human and mouse malignant melanoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. We also analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from previous studies ( Guo et al., 2018 14. Guo, X. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Zheng, L. ...

Med. 2020; 26 :792-802 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ) to map the detailed expression of Sb9 and GrB in melanoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer of human origin. Sb9 and GrB were detected in these tumor cells, and their expression levels were measured in comparison to tumor-infiltrating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells as a positive control ( Figure S1 A). Additionally, mouse cancer cell lines (B16, mouse melanoma; 4T1, mouse breast cancer; and LLC1, mouse lung cancer) and human cancer cell lines (A375, human melanoma; A549, human lung cancer; and SK-BR3, human breast cancer) also expressed both Sb9 ( Figure S1 C) and GrB ( Figure S1 D). Then, B16 cells and LLC1 cells were implanted into UBC-GFP transgenic mice (expressing GFP under the direction of the human ubiquitin C promoter), as previously described ( Andersson et al., 2009 1.

Novel CCL21-vault nanocapsule intratumoral delivery inhibits lung cancer growth PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e18758 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the tumors were collected at day 17 post-implantation to compare GrB expression between the tumor and the host. Most GrB + cells were GFP negative, indicating the presence of tumor-expressed GrB ( Figure S1 B). Inhibition of GrB by Sb9 via a classic serpin mechanism resulted in an SDS-resistant 62 kDa Sb9-GrB complex in B16 cells ( Figures 1 C and 1D; Mangan et al., 2016 32. Mangan, M.S. ∙ Bird, C.H. ∙ Kaiserman, D. ... A Novel Serpin Regulatory Mechanism: SerpinB9 IS REVERSIBLY INHIBITED BY VICINAL DISULFIDE BOND FORMATION IN THE REACTIVE CENTER LOOP J. Biol.

Serine protease inhibitor 6 protects cytotoxic T cells from self-inflicted injury by ensuring the integrity of cytotoxic granules Immunity. 2006; 24 :451-461 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Western blot demonstrated that Sb9 was expressed mainly as a 47 kDa unbound monomer, while a smaller portion of Sb9 formed a 62 kDa Sb9-GrB complex in B16 cells ( Figure 1 C) ( Mangan et al., 2016 32. Mangan, M.S. ∙ Bird, C.H. ∙ Kaiserman, D. ... A Novel Serpin Regulatory Mechanism: SerpinB9 IS REVERSIBLY INHIBITED BY VICINAL DISULFIDE BOND FORMATION IN THE REACTIVE CENTER LOOP J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :3626-3638 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that almost all of the GrB exists as a 62 kDa complex with Sb9, in contrast to the 26 kDa monomeric GrB found in B16 cells ( Figure 1 D). The GrB RNAscope staining demonstrates the gene expression of GrB (green) in both B16 and 4T1 cells ( Figure 1 E). Furthermore, a GranToxiLux assay, which measures GrB activity in live cells, demonstrated that the GrB in B16 is functionally active ( Figure 1 F).
To address the protection of Sb9 from GrB in melanoma cells, we disrupted the SERPINB9 gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We targeted the 20-nucleotide sequence upstream of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in exon 6 of the SERPINB9 gene ( Figure S1 E). Deletion of Sb9 in the B16 cells was confirmed by western blot ( Figure S1 F). The complex formation was hampered, suggesting that all GrB in the cell is no longer captured by Sb9. Residual Sb9 protein expression by B16-Sb9 knockout (KO) cells is not an infrequent observation ( Figure S1 F), due to common tetraploidy in these cells ( Kendal et al., 1987 22. Kendal, W.S. ∙ Wang, R.Y. ∙ Hsu, T.C. ... Rate of generation of major karyotypic abnormalities in relationship to the metastatic potential of B16 murine melanoma Cancer Res. 1987; 47 :3835-3841 PubMed Google Scholar ; Smits et al., 2019 49. Smits, A.H. ∙ Ziebell, F. ∙ Joberty, G. ... Biological plasticity rescues target activity in CRISPR knock outs Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1087-1093 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sb9 RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining for Sb9 confirmed its lack of expression in B16-Sb9 KO cells ( Figures S1 G and S1H).
However, Sb9 KO did not affect the proliferation of B16 cells, as evidenced by a colony formation assay and the expression of Ki67 gene ( Figures S1 I and S1J; Li et al., 2015 28. Li, L.T. ∙ Jiang, G. ∙ Chen, Q. ... Ki67 is a promising molecular target in the diagnosis of cancer (review) Mol. Med. Rep. 2015; 11 :1566-1572 Crossref Scopus (538) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sb9 KO resulted in 2-fold increase (p = 0.016) in GrB activity ( Figure S1 K) and a corresponding 2.3-fold (p = 0.017) increase in GrB-specific apoptosis in B16-Sb9 KO cells compared to B16-wild-type (WT) cells ( Figure 1 H). Previous studies have reported that interleukin (IL)-2 induces GrB expression in cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and natural killer (NK) CLs ( Tamang et al., 2006 52. Tamang, D.L. ∙ Redelman, D. ∙ Alves, B.N. ... Induction of granzyme B and T cell cytotoxic capacity by IL-2 or IL-15 without antigens: multiclonal responses that are extremely lytic if triggered and short-lived after cytokine withdrawal Cytokine. 2006; 36 :148-159 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the mRNA level of GrB was significantly higher in IL-2-treated B16-WT cells and followed a dose-dependent response ( Figure S1 L). Additionally, the expression of GrB was also elevated significantly in IL-2-treated B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO cells ( Figures 1 G and S1 O). The cleaved caspase-3 (C-CAS3) expression was higher in B16-Sb9 KO cells compared to B16-WT and increased with IL-2 treatment ( Figure S1 P). The apoptosis rates (as indicated by the annexin-V + and viability − population) of B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO cells were significantly higher following treatment with multiple concentrations of IL-2 ( Figure 1 H), while B16-Sb9 and GrB KO cells showed no IL-2-induced apoptosis ( Figure S1 M). The GrB inhibitor 368050 also suppressed apoptosis following treatment with IL-2 ( Figure S1 N). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Sb9 is required to protect tumors from GrB-induced apoptosis.
To investigate the role of Sb9 in tumor progression and metastasis in vivo , B16-WT or B16-Sb9 KO cells were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice, then tumor growth was monitored to the size end points. The Sb9-disrupted tumors were ∼4-fold smaller (p = 0.0001) than the B16-WT group at day 27 post-implantation ( Figure 2 A). The mice reached the size end points at 27 days and 39 days in the B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO, respectively ( Figure 2 A). We also compared the sizes of B16-Sb9&GrB KO tumors with the B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO tumors to assess the differential effects of tumor-derived and host-derived GrB in tumor growth. The B16-Sb9&GrB KO tumors grew faster than the B16-Sb9 KO tumors and slower than the B16-WT tumors ( Figure S2 A). The intermediate protection seen in B16-Sb9&GrB KO mice could be due to exposure to host-derived GrB. No difference was noted in the size of B16-Sb9 KO tumors derived from a single clone or those from a bulk cell population ( Figure S2 B). Staining of the melanoma sections with the melanoma marker MelanA at day 17 following implantation revealed a much smaller MelanA + area in the B16-Sb9 KO group than the B16-WT group ( Figures 2 B and 2C). The median survival time (MST) of mice bearing B16-Sb9 KO tumors was significantly longer (p < 0.0001) than that of mice bearing B16-WT tumors ( Figure S2 C). B16-Sb9 KO tumors exhibited more apoptosis and higher expression of cleaved caspase-3 than the B16-WT tumors in vivo , while the proliferation rate was similar in both groups ( Figures 2 D–2F, S2 D, and S2E).
However, no difference was observed in the levels of Tregs, TAMs (M1 and M2), and MDSCs between the B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO ( Figures 2 G–2I and S2 F), indicating that Sb9 tumor expression had minimal impact on the proportion of immunosuppressive cell populations in the TME. Metastasis of B16-Sb9 KO tumors was also decreased, as evidenced by the decreased levels of melanoma cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) ( Figures 2 J–2L). The size of TDLNs in the B16-Sb9 KO group was significantly (p = 0.0006) smaller than that in the B16-WT group ( Figures 2 K–2M). Additionally, we observed co-expression of Sb9 and MelanA in metastatic lesions of human melanoma in the LN ( Figure 2 N).
B16 cells overexpressing Sb9 (B16-Sb9 2+ cells) were generated, and Sb9 was confirmed by western blotting ( Figure 2 O). Following subcutaneous injection into C57BL/6 mice, we observed that the B16-Sb9 2+ tumors grew significantly more rapidly (3.2-fold, p = 0.017) at 21 days post-implantation in comparison to the B16-WT group ( Figure 2 P). We also utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to ablate Sb9 in other cell lines (4T1, LLC1, and A375) and observed significant growth inhibition of Sb9-disrupted mouse breast tumors, lung tumors, and human melanoma tumors after implantation ( Figures S2 G–S2I). The population of Nestin + cells was also lower in B16-Sb9 KO sections ( Figure S2 J). Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that expression of Sb9 promotes tumor growth and metastases in vivo in a cell-intrinsic manner.
We investigated the role of Sb9 in the host immune response to tumors in Sb9 KO mice ( Zhang et al., 2006 58. Zhang, M. ∙ Park, S.M. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Serine protease inhibitor 6 protects cytotoxic T cells from self-inflicted injury by ensuring the integrity of cytotoxic granules Immunity. 2006; 24 :451-461 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Melanoma tumors grew more slowly (2.7-fold, p = 0.0009, day 27) in Sb9 KO mice, as compared with WT mice ( Figure 3 A), resulting in a significantly longer (p = 0.0008) MST in Sb9 KO melanoma-bearing mice than WT mice ( Figure 3 B). The Sb9 KO mice implanted with the B16-WT tumors reached their size end point at day 33, as compared to day 27 for the WT mice ( Figure 3 A). However, maximal protection against melanoma development was observed when both tumor and host were deficient in Sb9 ( Figure 3 C). We monitored B16-Sb9 KO tumors in Sb9 KO mice until day 70, and they remained ∼600 mm 3 in size with a flattened growth trajectory ( Figure 3 C). The MST of Sb9 KO mice implanted with Sb9 KO tumors (Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group) was much longer (p < 0.0001) than that of WT mice implanted with WT tumors (WT/WT group) (MST >110 days versus MST = 21 days) ( Figure 3 D). Additionally, we compared the proliferation rate (% of Ki67 + cells) of the WT/WT group and Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group at day 24 and day 40 in vivo . No significant difference was found between the proliferation rate of the WT/WT group with that of the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group, either at day 24 or day 40 ( Figure S3 A). The apoptosis rate (% of c-cas3 + cells) of the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group was significantly higher than the WT/WT group at day 24, whereas that of the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group at day 40 was the highest (∼40% apoptosis rate) ( Figure S3 B). Sb9 deficiency resulted in increased caspase-3 and GrB expression by tumors from the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group, as compared with those from the WT/WT group ( Figures S3 C and S3D).
Next, we examined the effect of host deficiency of Sb9 on the TME of implanted melanomas. Tregs are potent suppressors of anti-tumor effector T cells and protected from cell-intrinsic GrB by endogenous Sb9 ( Azzi et al., 2013 3. Azzi, J. ∙ Skartsis, N. ∙ Mounayar, M. ... Serine protease inhibitor 6 plays a critical role in protecting murine granzyme B-producing regulatory T cells J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :2319-2327 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ratios of effector CD8 + to Treg cells (p = 0.0156), CD44 + CD62L − (effector memory) CD8 + to Treg cells (p = 0.0003), effector TNFα + CD8 + to Treg cells (p = 0.0012), effector GrB + CD8 + to Treg cells (p = 0.002), and effector interferon (IFN)γ + CD8 + to Treg cells (p = 0.0023) were all significantly higher in the sections from the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group, as compared with those from the WT/WT group ( Figures 3 E–3H and S3 E).
In addition to Tregs, the recruitment of immunosuppressive TAMs and MDSCs also play a critical role in tumor progression ( Kitamura et al., 2015 24. Kitamura, T. ∙ Qian, B.Z. ∙ Pollard, J.W. Immune cell promotion of metastasis Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :73-86 Crossref Scopus (902) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ugel et al., 2015 55. Ugel, S. ∙ De Sanctis, F. ∙ Mandruzzato, S. ... Tumor-induced myeloid deviation: when myeloid-derived suppressor cells meet tumor-associated macrophages J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :3365-3376 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fluorescence micrographs demonstrate the expression of Sb9 in the TAMs (CD11b + , Ly-6C − ) and MDSCs (CD11b + , Gr-1 + ) within melanoma and breast tumors ( Figures S3 G–S3J). The levels of TAMs (p = 0.0093) and MDSCs (p = 0.025) were also significantly lower in melanoma sections from the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group, as compared to the WT/WT group ( Figure 3 I and 3J). We conclude that loss of Sb9 in Tregs, TAMs, and MDSCs expose them to GrB-mediated killing within the TME, ultimately leading to restoration of the antitumor immune response and inhibition of tumor progression. This effect on immunosuppressive cells overall is apparently more dominant for anti-tumor immunity than any decrease in the survival of CLs. Furthermore, an increased level of effector IL-2 + CD4 + cells and decreased levels of immunosuppressive IL-10 + CD4 + cells and IL-10 + CD8 + cells were found in the TME sections from the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group ( Figures 3 K, 3L, and S3 F).
CAFs inhibit host resolution of solid cancers by preventing access of effector T cells to tumor cells ( Kalluri, 2016 19. Kalluri, R. The biology and function of fibroblasts in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :582-598 Crossref Scopus (2821) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of CAFs in melanomas from the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group, as shown by the expression of fibronectin (4.1-fold, p < 0.0001), collagen-I (3.7-fold, p = 0.0002), PDGFR-β (3.3-fold, p = 0.0002), and α-SMA (3.9-fold, p < 0.0001), was dramatically reduced compared to the WT/WT group ( Figures 3 M–3P). To further assess the effect of Sb9 expression in the tumor stroma on the growth of tumors, we co-cultured B16-GFP cells with the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from the bone marrow of either C57BL/6-WT mice or Sb9 KO mice ( Zhu et al., 2010 59. Zhu, H. ∙ Guo, Z.K. ∙ Jiang, X.X. ... A protocol for isolation and culture of mesenchymal stem cells from mouse compact bone Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5 :550-560 Crossref Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ). We investigated whether MSC-WT or MSC-Sb9 KO cells differ in their capacity to support B16 melanoma cells in vitro by assessing their growth together in culture plates. Micrographs of the co-cultured MSC-WT and B16-GFP cells revealed multiple dense clusters comprised of both MSC-WT and B16 cells, while the MSC-Sb9 KO and B16 cells were scattered and not situated in proximity to each other ( Figure 3 Q, top). Then, we assessed the accumulation of fibronectin and collagen I as surrogate markers of a fibrotic tumor microenvironment, which is a major barrier against the penetration of chemotherapeutic agents and constitutes a significant obstacle to their efficacy. We observed that MSC-WT cells produced fibronectin and collagen I more readily in co-culture with B16-GFP cells than the MSC-Sb9 KO cells group ( Figures 3 Q, middle and bottom, 3 R, and 3S). These data indicate that the presence of Sb9 in stromal cells promotes their growth, synthesis of ECM fibers, and proliferative effect on B16 cells.
A fragment-based drug discovery approach was used to identify a small organic molecule that binds to recombinant human Sb9 produced in E. coli ( Figure S4 A). To express soluble Sb9, an N-terminal fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP) ( Figure S4 B) was constructed, purified, and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MBP-Sb9 protein: 90.17 kDa) ( Figures S4 C and S4D). Functional activity of MBP-Sb9 was measured by its dose-dependent inhibitory effects on isolated GrB activity ( Figure S4 E). A thermal stability assay (TSA) was developed, showing an Sb9-specific transition at 51.5°C (T m 1) ( Figure S4 F), and used in a screen, which identified two compounds (ZT0587 and ZT0805) on the basis of a dose-dependent T m 1 shift ( Figures 4 A and S4 G), with binding of fragment ZT0587 to MBP-Sb9 with a K D of 88 μM ( Figure 4 B). An increasingly complicated series of dihydroxybenzoic-like compounds was selected by an analog-by-catalog; one of these, compound 3034 (1,3-benzoxazole-6-carboxylic acid), exhibited direct binding to Sb9 with a K D of 273 μM as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) ( Figure 4 B). We next evaluated in B16 cells the ability of top-ranking analogs to inhibit intracellular Sb9 as well as cell penetration, by measuring the induction of caspase-3 activity, a surrogate marker for increased GrB activity. Treatment with 3034 exhibited an ∼4-fold increase in caspase-3 activity (p = 0.0003), compared to ZT0587 ( Figure 4 C). Additionally, the apoptosis rate (as indicated by the annexin-V + and viability − population by fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS]) of B16 cells treated with 3034 was significantly higher than ZT0587 at both the 12-h and 24-h time points ( Figure S4 H).
Saturation-transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays demonstrated that compound 3034 bound to MBP-Sb9 protein and revealed that this interaction was significantly enhanced at lower pH in a pH-dependent manner ( Figures 4 D and 4E). With a pH as low as 4, lysosomes are the most acidic compartments within cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the environment of lysosomes is conducive for binding between compound 3034 and Sb9. We showed that both Sb9 and GrB were co-localized in the lysosomes of B16 melanoma cells ( Figure 4 F), and we showed that compound 3034 reduced the expression of the Sb9-GrB complex by B16 cells in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 4 G). Interestingly, compound 3034 significantly increased LAMP1 expression and expanded lysosomes, suggesting that Sb9 activity is associated with lysosomal biogenesis ( Figure 4 H).
We assessed the anti-tumor activity of compound 3034 in vivo . Injections of compound 3034 significantly reduced (3.7-fold, p = 0.0014) the size of B16 tumors implanted in the flanks of mice, compared to the control injected group ( Figures 5 A and S5 A). Next, we examined the effect of compound 3034 on tumor immunity. The populations of CD44 + CD62L − (effector memory) CD8 + , effector GrB + CD8 + , and effector IFNγ + CD8 + cells were all significantly higher in the melanoma sections from the 3034-treatment group, as compared with those from the control group ( Figures 5 B–5D). The levels of immunosuppressive Tregs, TAMs, and MDSCs (p = 0.025) were significantly lower in sections from the 3034-treatment group, as compared to the control group ( Figures 5 E–5G). Furthermore, an increased level of effector IFNγ + CD4 + cells and a decreased level of immunosuppressive IL-10 + CD4 + cells and IL-10 + CD8 + cells were found in the TME sections from the 3034-treatment group ( Figures 5 H, S5 B, and S5C).
To assess if the anti-tumor effects of compound 3034 were generalizable to human diseases, we also tested efficacy in an NSG humanized mouse model of A375. Compound 3034 reduced the size of human melanoma tumors significantly (2.1-fold, p = 0.0158), compared to controls ( Figure S5 D). Compound 3034 induced GrB-mediated apoptosis in B16 melanoma cells ( Figure 5 I). GranToxiLux assay demonstrated increased activity of GrB in B16 cells treated with compound 3034 ( Figures 5 J and 5K). We conclude that compound 3034 can inhibit Sb9 in melanoma tumor cells and render them susceptible to GrB-mediated apoptosis.
To evaluate the off-target effects of compound 3034 to Sb9, we treated the B16-Sb9 KO cells with various concentrations of compound 3034. No additional apoptotic effect was observed ( Figure 5 L). Furthermore, we did not observe antitumor effects of compound 3034 on the Sb9 KO mice bearing B16-Sb9 KO tumors, as compared to the control group ( Figure 5 M).
To further assess the in vivo toxicity of compound 3034, 300 μg of compound 3034 was administered twice a day intraperitoneally for 14 days. The CBC results showed no significant difference in WBC, HGB, and PLT between control and treatment groups ( Figure S5 E). The serum cells suggested that AST, ALT, CRE, and ALB levels were similar between the two groups ( Figure S5 F). H&E staining demonstrated that compound 3034 showed no toxicity to liver, kidney, lung, and heart tissues in mice ( Figure S5 G).
To investigate the effect of compound 3034 on the tumor stroma, MSC-WT cells were treated with compound 3034 for 48 h. Compound 3034 treatment reduced the production of fibronectin and collagen I by MSC-WT cells significantly ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). As expected, compound 3034 decreased the expression of fibronectin and collagen I by MSC-WT cells that were co-cultured with B16 cells ( Figures 6 B, 6C, and S6 B).
Breast cancers exhibit a high degree of immunosuppression by their surrounding stroma ( Kalluri, 2016 19. Kalluri, R. The biology and function of fibroblasts in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :582-598 Crossref Scopus (2821) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lauricella et al., 2016 27. Lauricella, M. ∙ Carlisi, D. ∙ Giuliano, M. ... The analysis of estrogen receptor-α positive breast cancer stem-like cells unveils a high expression of the serpin proteinase inhibitor PI-9: Possible regulatory mechanisms Int. J. Oncol. 2016; 49 :352-360 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sb9 is highly expressed in human primary breast tumor cells ( Figures 1 and S6 C) and in the stromal cells within the TME ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Therefore, we investigated whether compound 3034 could be used to treat mice implanted with 4T1 breast tumor cells. Treatment with compound 3034 significantly reduced (2.5-fold, p = 0.0006) the size of 4T1-derived tumors ( Figure 6 D) in comparison to the control group (the size end points were days 27 and 21, respectively). The MST of 4T1 tumors treated with 3034 was significantly longer (p < 0.0001) than the control group (29 days versus 22.5 days) ( Figure S6 E). Treatment with compound 3034 also resulted in reduced levels of stromal cells and CAFs ( Figures 6 E–6J).
Furthermore, we observed similar antitumor effects of compound 3034 in two other in vivo tumor models: Renca kidney tumor and LLC1 lung tumor (tumor size in Figures 6 K and 6L; survival in Figures S6 F and S6G). We conclude that inhibition of Sb9 by compound 3034 has potent anti-tumor effects in a broad spectrum of malignancies, including melanomas, as well as breast, lung, and kidney cancer.

Section: Discussion

The majority of malignant tumors are immunologically silent. In order to grow in an immune-competent host, tumor cells acquire genetic mutations and undergo epigenetic changes that result in immune-resistant phenotypes ( Kather et al., 2018 21. Kather, J.N. ∙ Suarez-Carmona, M. ∙ Charoentong, P. ... Topography of cancer-associated immune cells in human solid tumors eLife. 2018; 7 :e36967 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ; Trujillo et al., 2018 54.

T Cell-Inflamed versus Non-T Cell-Inflamed Tumors: A Conceptual Framework for Cancer Immunotherapy Drug Development and Combination Therapy Selection Cancer Immunol. Res. 2018; 6 :990-1000 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an effort to make tumors immunologically active, genotoxic therapies (such as radio- and chemotherapy) have been used as adjuvants for immunotherapy by evoking innate immune responses, such as type I-IFN signaling. However, these adjuvant strategies are hampered by the induction of suppressors of type I-IFN pathway by genotoxic agents ( Trujillo et al., 2018 54. Trujillo, J.A. ∙ Sweis, R.F. ∙ Bao, R. ... T Cell-Inflamed versus Non-T Cell-Inflamed Tumors: A Conceptual Framework for Cancer Immunotherapy Drug Development and Combination Therapy Selection Cancer Immunol. Res. 2018; 6 :990-1000 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). To circumvent this problem, combinations of up to 3 treatments may have to be used, complicating clinical trials. Progression of cancer is dependent upon both the biological characteristics of the cancer cells and the immunological status of the host ( Gonzalez et al., 2018 13. Gonzalez, H. ∙ Hagerling, C. ∙ Werb, Z. Roles of the immune system in cancer: from tumor initiation to metastatic progression Genes Dev. 2018; 32 :1267-1284 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The expression of GrB in immune cells is appreciated widely ( Russell and Ley, 2002 46. Russell, J.H. ∙ Ley, T.J. Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20 :323-370 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the findings of other studies ( D’Eliseo et al., 2010 9. D’Eliseo, D. ∙ Pisu, P. ∙ Romano, C. ...

Expression of granzyme B sensitizes ALK+ ALCL tumour cells to apoptosis-inducing drugs Mol. Cancer. 2014; 13 :199 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ours highlight the potential importance of tumor-derived GrB as well. Our discovery of how these dual sources of GrB (both host- and cancer-derived) cause cancer cell death directly through both the inhibition of cancer cell-produced Sb9 and liberation of host anti-tumor immunity lays the groundwork for the singular modality to treat immunologically silent tumors. Future studies are required to determine the regional effect of tumor-derived GrB.
Remarkable heterogeneity is manifested by the distinct morphological and phenotypic profiles of different cancers, including various proliferative and metastatic capacities ( Meacham and Morrison, 2013 33. Meacham, C.E. ∙ Morrison, S.J. Tumour heterogeneity and cancer cell plasticity Nature. 2013; 501 :328-337 Crossref Scopus (1817) PubMed Google Scholar ). This variety is likely to result in a range of adaptive behaviors by tumors to alterations in microenvironmental conditions and/or different capacities for malignant transformation ( Tellez-Gabriel et al., 2016 53. Tellez-Gabriel, M. ∙ Ory, B. ∙ Lamoureux, F. ... Tumour Heterogeneity: The Key Advantages of Single-Cell Analysis Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016; 17 :2142 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that cancer cells with higher levels of Sb9 and/or GrB may adopt more aggressive phenotypes.
In this report, we used genetic ablation to demonstrate a direct requirement of Sb9 for tumor cell growth through inhibition of cell death caused by GrB. This is consistent with previous correlative studies in mice and humans ( Bots et al., 2006 7. Bots, M. ∙ Offringa, R. ∙ Medema, J.P. Does the serpin PI-9 protect tumor cells? Blood. 2006; 107 :4974-4975 author reply 4975 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Medema et al., 2001a 34. Medema, J.P. ∙ de Jong, J. ∙ Peltenburg, L.T. ... Blockade of the granzyme B/perforin pathway through overexpression of the serine protease inhibitor PI-9/SPI-6 constitutes a mechanism for immune escape by tumors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :11515-11520 Crossref Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar , 2001b 35. Medema, J.P. ∙ Schuurhuis, D.H. ∙ Rea, D. ...

Med. 2001; 194 :657-667 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). Along with others, we described the expression of Sb9 in both effector and immune-suppressive cells ( Azzi et al., 2013 3. Azzi, J. ∙ Skartsis, N. ∙ Mounayar, M. ... Serine protease inhibitor 6 plays a critical role in protecting murine granzyme B-producing regulatory T cells J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :2319-2327 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mangan et al., 2008 31. Mangan, M.S. ∙ Kaiserman, D. ∙ Bird, P.I. The role of serpins in vertebrate immunity Tissue Antigens. 2008; 72 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Phillips et al., 2004 40. Phillips, T. ∙ Opferman, J.T. ∙ Shah, R. ... A role for the granzyme B inhibitor serine protease inhibitor 6 in CD8+ memory cell homeostasis J. Immunol. 2004; 173 :3801-3809 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ablation of Sb9 results in the impaired survival of CTL specific to intracellular pathogens ( Zhang et al., 2006 58. Zhang, M. ∙ Park, S.M. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Serine protease inhibitor 6 protects cytotoxic T cells from self-inflicted injury by ensuring the integrity of cytotoxic granules Immunity. 2006; 24 :451-461 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we show that the aggregate effect of Sb9 ablation is increased CTL-based immunity to tumors in vivo . We conclude that the increased immunity to tumors in Sb9 KO mice is due more to the impaired survival of immuno-suppressive cells in the TME than any decrease in cell-intrinsic viability of GrB + CTL. Sb9 is also known to inhibit caspase-1 (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme), which is involved in the inflammatory response by cleaving the precursors of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33 ( Annand et al., 1999 2. Annand, R.R. ∙ Dahlen, J.R. ∙ Sprecher, C.A. ... Caspase-1 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme) is inhibited by the human serpin analogue proteinase inhibitor 9 Biochem. J. 1999; 342 :655-665 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Young et al., 2000 57. Young, J.L. ∙ Sukhova, G.K. ∙ Foster, D. ... The serpin proteinase inhibitor 9 is an endogenous inhibitor of interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme (caspase-1) activity in human vascular smooth muscle cells J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191 :1535-1544 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). The inflammatory microenvironment can directly modulate the number, function, migration, and maintenance of effector immune cells ( Kim and Harty, 2014 23. Kim, M.T. ∙ Harty, J.T. Impact of Inflammatory Cytokines on Effector and Memory CD8+ T Cells Front. Immunol. 2014; 5 :295 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, alteration of this milieu may constitute an alternative pathway by which Sb9 suppresses the inflammatory response and escapes from immune surveillance against tumors.
Notably, metastasis of melanoma to the TDLNs was significantly less frequent in the B16-Sb9 KO group. Given that the metastatic melanoma within the LN also expressed Sb9, one could speculate that Sb9 could protect metastatic niches against the CTL of LN, providing a mechanism for the spreading of neoplasms through lymphatics. Furthermore, various cancers have been associated with a heterogeneous and adaptive TME, and their growth can be driven by the local TME in which they thrive. Besides lymphocytes and other immune cells, stromal cells are a major cellular component of the diverse TME that plays a critical role in tumor development ( Nilendu et al., 2018 37. Nilendu, P. ∙ Sarode, S.C. ∙ Jahagirdar, D. ... Mutual concessions and compromises between stromal cells and cancer cells: driving tumor development and drug resistance Cell Oncol. (Dordr.). 2018; 41 :353-367 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our finding that Sb9 regulates the function of the stroma is supported by our previous report for Sb9 in protecting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from exogenous GrB ( El Haddad et al., 2011a 11. El Haddad, N. ∙ Heathcote, D. ∙ Moore, R. ... Mesenchymal stem cells express serine protease inhibitor to evade the host immune response Blood. 2011; 117 :1176-1183 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar , 2011b 12. El Haddad, N. ∙ Moore, R. ∙ Heathcote, D. ... The novel role of SERPINB9 in cytotoxic protection of human mesenchymal stem cells J. Immunol. 2011; 187 :2252-2260 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). CAFs have received increasing attention as the key cellular player within the tumor stroma that supports the initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancers ( Kalluri, 2016 19. Kalluri, R. The biology and function of fibroblasts in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :582-598 Crossref Scopus (2821) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2018 56. Wei, L. ∙ Ye, H. ∙ Li, G. ... Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote progression and gemcitabine resistance via the SDF-1/SATB-1 pathway in pancreatic cancer Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :1065 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly in our melanoma mouse model, we found suppression of CAF activity with less accumulation and generation of matrix proteins as well as lower neovascularization in the Sb9 KO/Sb9 KO group. These findings suggest that lack of Sb9 in the stromal cells, including CAFs and MSCs, of the Sb9-deficient host could increase their susceptibility to the lethal effect of GrB released within the stroma. Notably, GrB has also been reported to be an extracellular substrate with ability to also cleave ECM materials, promoting tumor cell migration and metastasis ( Prakash et al., 2014 43. Prakash, M.D. ∙ Munoz, M.A. ∙ Jain, R. ... Granzyme B promotes cytotoxic lymphocyte transmigration via basement membrane remodeling Immunity. 2014; 41 :960-972 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation further highlights the importance of Sb9 inhibition in suppressing tumor metastasis. Altogether, pharmacologic inhibitors of Sb9 target tumors on multiple levels, inducing death of the tumor cells by their own GrB, downregulation of the immunosuppressive cells in the TME, and elimination of angiogenesis and the stroma, thereby rendering the TME less conducive for tumor growth and metastasis.
We regard this report as a starting point for the introduction of a small-molecule inhibitor of Sb9. Like any other field in its infancy, the field of Sb9 inhibition therapeutics requires more work for characterization and optimization of binding affinity as well as efficacy. For instance, one key challenge that remains is to generate drugs with improved affinity through high-throughput screening of fragments. Although the affinity of our compound remains in the expected range of small molecules, it may have much better affinity i n vivo for many reasons. For example, the low pH of the lysosome confers a much higher affinity of compound 3034 to Sb9. Sb9 produced by the tumor likely undergoes significant post-translational modifications (not recapitulated in our screening assays) that may increase its affinity to compound 3034. Although the generation of selective ligands with high binding affinity defines the current paradigm, many low-affinity drugs could also be effective ( Csermely et al., 2005 8. Csermely, P. ∙ Agoston, V. ∙ Pongor, S. The efficiency of multi-target drugs: the network approach might help drug design Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26 :178-182 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (736) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lipton, 2006 30. Lipton, S.A. Paradigm shift in neuroprotection by NMDA receptor blockade: memantine and beyond Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5 :160-170 Crossref Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mestres and Gregori-Puigjané, 2009 36. Mestres, J. ∙ Gregori-Puigjané, E. Conciliating binding efficiency and polypharmacology Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 30 :470-474 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of Sb9, the development of a similar drug with a larger size and better affinity than 3034 may not result in an improvement of clinical efficacy, as its larger size may limit its cellular entry. Nonetheless, the fact that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Sb9 in mice did not result in significant anomalies or side effects highlights the selectivity of the compound and its potential applicability for clinical translation. These findings also demonstrate the potential importance of disseminating our data to create the momentum needed to advance discoveries of Sb9 inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are considered the most recent cancer therapeutic breakthrough ( Peoples, 2019 39. Peoples, G.E. Improving the outcomes of checkpoint inhibitors in breast cancer Lancet Oncol. 2019; 20 :316-318 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, Sb9 inhibition could be superior, due to its multifaceted actions on key players responsible for the growth and metastasis of tumors. Furthermore, Sb9 inhibitors may prove to be safer than immune checkpoint inhibitors ( Peoples, 2019 39. Peoples, G.E. Improving the outcomes of checkpoint inhibitors in breast cancer Lancet Oncol. 2019; 20 :316-318 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ; Postow et al., 2018 42.

5μm sections of tissue were cut by cryosectioning and stained with conjugated or purified antibodies. Purified antibodies were detected using secondary antibodies. The antibodies used include anti-Sb9 (PA5-51038, Invitrogen), anti-mouse GrB (16G6, #14-8822-82, Invitrogen), anti-human GrB (2C5, sc-8022, SCBT), anti-human GrB (B18.1, NBP1-97525, Novus), anti-MelanA (ab51061, Abcam), anti-α-SMA (D4K9N, #19245S, CST), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, #9661, CST), anti-Collagen I (NB600-408, Novus), anti-Fibronectin (NBP1-91258, Novus), anti-PDGFR-α (APA5, ab90967, Abcam), anti-PDGFRβ (APB5, #14-1402-82, Invitrogen), anti-pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3, sc-81714, SCBT), anti-FAP (ab53066, Abcam), anti-FSP-1 (S100A4, ABF32, Millipore), FITC anti-CD11b (M1/70, #101206, Biolegend), FITC anti-Gr-1 (RB6-8C5, #108417, Biolegend), and anti-Ly-6C (HK1.4, #128012, Biolegend). DAPI (VECTASHIELD, Vector Laboratories) was used to counterstain the cell nuclei. The stained tissue sections were visualized using an EVOSTM FL Auto 2 Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for whole images and a fluorescence confocal microscope (Nikon) for high-resolution images. Quantification was performed on 2-3 sections from at least 3 separate mice using image analysis softwares Celleste (Invitrogen) and ImageJ (NCBI, 1.8.0_112).
Granzyme B and Sb9 mRNA in situ hybridization (ISH) was measured with RNAscope assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, ACD, Hayward, CA), according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, 4T1 cells, B16 cells or B16-Sb9 KO cells were hybridized with Granzyme B probe (ACD, Cat. No. 490191), Sb9 probe (ACD, Cat. No. 578121), positive control probe (ACD, Cat. No.320881), and negative control probe (ACD, Cat. No. 320871) at 40°C for 2 h. Hybridization signals were amplified and visualized with RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (ACD, Cat. No. 323100). Images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (EVOSTM FL AUTO 2).
Lysates of cells and tissues were measured using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were immunoblotted with the following specific antibodies: anti-Sb9 (PA5-51038, Invitrogen), anti-mouse GrB (16G6, #14-8822-82, Invitrogen), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, #9661, CST), anti–GAPDH (Abcam), anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Abcam), anti-rat IgG-HRP (Abcam), using standard protocols. The blots were developed with West Dura chemiluminescent substrates using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system.
Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were plated at 20–30% density in 12-well plates 24hrs prior to transfection. For plasmid transfection, the equivalent of 0.4 μg of plasmid per well of a 12-well plate was utilized. Plasmids utilized included Control Double Nickase Plasmid (control plasmid, sc-437281, SCBT), PI-9 Double Nickase Plasmid (h) (sc-404486-NIC, SCBT), granzyme B Double Nickase Plasmid (m) (sc-420745-NIC, SCBT) and serpinB9 expression plasmid in pcDNA3.1+/C-(K)DYK (OMu03805D, GenScript). After 24∼72 hr incubation, selective medium was used to complete screening for successfully transfected cells. PI-9 Double Nickase Plasmid (h) is designed to disrupt gene expression by causing highly specific Cas9-mediated double nicking of the SERPINB9 (human) gene, which mimics a double-strand break. It consists of a pair of plasmids, each encoding a D10A mutated Cas9 nuclease and a unique, target-specific 20 nt guide RNA (gRNA). This pair of gRNAs target exon 3 of the SERPINB9 (human) gene, and their sequences are ACCTGCTGAGAACGGCCAAC and TCACTTCAGTGAGAAGCGAC. Control Double Nickase Plasmid was used as the negative control. To disrupt gene expression of the SERPINB9 (mouse) gene, we targeted the 20-nucleotide sequence upstream of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in exon 6 of the SERPINB9 (mouse) gene. The gRNA (sequence GCACCTCCTTCACATAGGCG) was cloned at the BsmBI site into the LentiCRISPRv2-blast (#98293, Addgene) vector, and pLentiCRIPSRv2 gRNA was subjected to sequence analysis to confirm the inserted oligonucleotide. Empty LentiCRISPRv2-blast vector was used as negative control. Lentiviral particles were generated by co-transfecting LentiCRISPRv2-blast plasmid into HEK293T cells with packaging plasmids pVSVg (#8485, Addgene) and psPAX2 (#12260, Addgene). For lentivirus transduction, cells were infected at either 20 or 40 MOI for 24 h with a Cas9-expressing lentivirus. Following blasticidin selection, we used the limiting dilution method in 96-well plates to select single-cell clones. The expression of Sb9 in the puromycin/G418/blasticidine-resistant clones was then analyzed by western blotting. Parental B16 cells were transduced with pLenti PGK GFP Puro encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA and the puromycin resistance gene (Puro) under the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. High GFP-expressing cells were selected using puromycin. The lentiviral vectors are self-inactivating vectors in which the viral enhancer and promoter have been deleted, and this transcription inactivation increases biosafety.
Total RNA was prepared from cells using the Quick-RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was prepared from total RNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo). Following reverse transcription, quantitative PCR was performed using a cycling profile consisting of 95°C for 2min (Stage I), 40 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 70°C for 30 s (Stage II), and 65°C for 5 s (Stage III). Fold changes were determined by subtracting Cq values of the loading control from the Cq values of the gene of interest. The results were normalized to untreated controls. Primers used for real time quantitative PCR are listed as follows: mouse GAPDH-F: AGCCACATCGCTCAGACAC, mouse GAPDH-R: GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC; mouse GrB-F: ATGAAGATCCTCCTGCTACTGC, mouse-GrB-R: CCCACATATCGCCTCAGGCT; mouse Ki67-F: AGAGCCTTAGCAATAGCAACG, mouse-Ki67-R: GTCTCCCGCGATTCCTCTG.
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane with oxygen. B16-F10, Renca, A375, LLC1 and 4T1 cell lines were gently injected subcutaneously in the right flanks or 4th mammary glands of mice. 1x10 5 cells were injected per mouse for most of the experiments. 25x10 3 cells were injected per mouse for the experiments using Compound 3034. Upon 4hrs post-implantation, 300 μg of Compound 3034 was administered twice a day intraperitoneally for 14 days. Tumor growth was monitored three times per week by digital caliper (FisherbrandTMTraceableTMDigital Calipers).
Tumor tissues from mice were minced into small pieces using a razor blade, then transferred to 70 μm cell strainers (BD) and separated mechanically using the plunger of a 5ml syringe. Cells that passed through the cell strainer were collected in a 50ml conical tube and resuspended in the RPMI-1640 complete growth medium. Then, the single-cell suspensions from tumors were ready for staining.
Cells were plated in 96-well round-bottom plates (Corning, NY) for intracellular cytokine staining and 96-well flat-bottom plates (Corning, NY) for cell-surface and intracellular transcription factor staining. The cell samples that underwent intracellular cytokine staining were first incubated with 100ng/ml PMA and 1μg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and GolgiStopTM protein transport inhibitor (BD Bioscience) at 37°C for 4hr. All samples were washed with DPBS prior to incubation with Fixable Viability Dye eFluorTM 780 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:1000 in DPBS for 30min at 4°C. Then, the cells were washed with FACS buffer (DPBS + 2% fetal bovine serum +1 mM EDTA + 0.1% sodium azide) and incubated for 30min at 4°C with the following cell-surface antibodies: PB anti-CD4 (GK1.5, #100428, Biolegend), BV510 anti-CD8 (53-6.7, #100752, Biolegend), APC anti-CD44 (IM7, #103012, Biolegend), PE/Cy7 anti-CD62L (MEL-14, #104418, Biolegend), PE anti-CD25 (7D4, #558642, BD PharMingen), BV510 anti-CD45 (30-F11, #103138, Biolegend), PE/Cy7 anti-CD11b (M1/70, #101216, Biolegend), PB anti-F4/80 (BM8, #123124, Biolegend), PE anti-Ly-6G (1A8, #127608, Biolegend), FITC anti-Gr-1 (RB6-8C5, #108417, Biolegend), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-Ly-6C (HK1.4, #128012, Biolegend), BV510 anti-CD4 (RM4-5, #100559, Biolegend), FITC anti-CD8 (53-6.7, #553031, BD PharMingen), APC anti-CD3 (17A2, #100236, Biolegend), PE anti-CD44 (BJ18, #338808, Biolegend), FITC anti-CD80 (16-10A1, #104706, Biolegend), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-CD86 (GL-1, #105026, Biolegend), APC anti-CD163 (S15049I, #155305, Biolegend), PE/Cy7 anti-CD206 (C068C2, #141720, Biolegend), and PE/Cy7 anti-PD-L1 (10F.9G2, #124314, Biolegend). All of the cell-surface antibodies were diluted 1:300 in FACS buffer. The cells were permeabilized using the eBioscience Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilization Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30min at 4°C. Then they were incubated with the following intracellular antibodies: PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-FOXP3 (FJK-16 s, #45-5773-82, Invitrogen), PB anti-GrB (GB11, #515408, Biolegend), APC anti-IFNγ(XMG1.2, #505810, Biolegend), FITC anti-TNFα (MP6-XT22, #506304, Biolegend), PE anti-IL-2 (JES6-5H4, #554428, BD PharMingen) and PE/Cy7 anti-IL-10 (JES5-16E3, #505026, Biolegend). All of the intracellular antibodies were diluted 1:300 in the eBioscience Permeabilization Buffer (1x) (Thermo Fisher). Cells were washed once with Permeabilization Buffer and fixed in FACS buffer containing 1% formalin. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD FACSCantoTM II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analysis of flow cytometry results was performed via FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR).
Isolation and harvest of murine MSCs from either C57BL/6-WT mice or Sb9 KO mice were performed according to the protocol as described previously ( Zhu et al., 2010 59. Zhu, H. ∙ Guo, Z.K. ∙ Jiang, X.X. ... A protocol for isolation and culture of mesenchymal stem cells from mouse compact bone Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5 :550-560 Crossref Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In an attempt to produce a soluble variant of Sb9, a construct was designed in which a hexa His-tagged maltose-binding protein (His-MBP) was added at the N terminus. Sb9 was soluble in multiple growth media conditions using this strategy. The condition (1mM IPTG, 37°C, 3hr) for best expression was selected for biomass production with 5L culture. The cells were lysed and clarified by centrifugation. The fusion protein was then captured by Ni-NTA affinity purification, such that it was eluted using high concentration imidazole. Then, the resulting protein was further purified by anionic exchange chromatography using a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) and a NaCl gradient for elution. An amount of 31.4mg protein was obtained. The purified Sb9 protein was characterized by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). A construct of human serpinB9 covering residues 2-376 with N-terminal His-tag in the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) was overexpressed in insect Trichoplusia ni cells adapted for suspension culture in ESF921 medium (Expression systems). Cells were grown at 27°C to a density of ∼2 million cells per mL, infected with baculovirus containing serpinB9 construct, collected by centrifugation around 60hrs post-infection, and stored at −80°C. Cell pellets were microfluidized at 15000 psi in buffer A (25mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20mM Imidazole, 7mM BME) and the resulting lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. Ni-NTA beads (QIAGEN) were mixed with lysate supernatant for 30 min and washed with buffer A and eluted with buffer B (25mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 400mM Imidazole, 7mM BME). The sample was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using an Superdex-200 16/60 column (GE healthcare) in buffer C (20mM HEPES-7.5, 200mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5mM TCEP, 3mM DTT). Protein containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80°C.
Analyses were performed on a Finnigan Laser MAT 2000 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, UK). The system used a nitrogen laser (337nm, 2ns pulse) to desorb ions from the sample specimen. The desorbed ions were accelerated to 20kV into a free long tube. The time recorded for a molecule to travel the length of the tube to a detector was proportional to the mass of the ion, which was its molecular weight. All spectra were obtained using the positive-ion mode. Standard stainless-steel targets (with a sample application area of about 3.14mm 2 ) obtained from the manufacturer were employed for all analyses. The lasermat software allowed the user to irradiate one of the four possible target regions or quadrants of about 0.02mm 2 . The spectra in this study were calibrated using instrumental calibration, based on the parameters determined from analysis of a number of standard proteins and peptides.
TSA is an analytic tool to estimate the overall stability of a protein by monitoring the shift in its melting temperature upon changing the buffer conditions or titrating various ligands. As the protein unfolds with increasing temperature in a thermal cycler (CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System), SYPRO orange dye binds to the exposed hydrophobic core and fluoresces, leading to the signal that is measured in comparison to temperature to produce a melt curve. The rate of dye uptake peaks at the melting transition and signals the melting temperature (Tm). As an initial assay, MBP-Sb9 was tested at 1 and 0.25mg/ml. Four tests were performed at each concentration in Buffer A1 (20mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 20mM sodium chloride, 5mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol): no additive, plus 10mM maltose, plus 5% glycerol, and plus 10% glycerol. Dye was added at 2x strength, and the readings were performed from 25 to 95°C at 0.5°C intervals. To set up the fragment screen assay, a plate was loaded with protein by manually pipetting 19 μL per well well-by-well. Then, 0.5 μL of fragment solutions were transferred from the 384-well library stock plate in a replicate manner, using an Integra ViaFlo II electronic pipette and mixing by swirling the pipette tips. This resulted in testing the Zenobia compounds at 5mM and the Life Chemicals compounds at 1.25mM, and all assay wells contained 2.5% DMSO. On all plates, at least 8 wells tested buffer alone and at least 24 wells tested 2.5% DMSO, with the latter used for the baseline measurement. Once a plate was set, it was sealed with foil and incubated with shaking for 1 hr at 25°C. Sypro Orange dye was added at 2x strength (Thermo S6650) using the ViaFlo pipette. The plate was sealed with clear adhesive, briefly shaken to disperse the dye, and measured using the BioRad C1000 thermal cycler with a CFX384 Touch RealTime detector. The measurement cycle was performed from 25 to 95°C with a measurement interval of 0.5°C. One plate of fragments was tested on a given day. A commercially available library of over 1,000 compounds was tested on four plates. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was performed on the compound ZT0587 (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) decorating the ring with various hydroxyl, methyl, amine, nitro, nitrile, carboxylic acid alternates and ring closure alternates. Compound 3034 (1,3-benzoxazole-6-carboxylic acid) was chosen based on its activity in the SPR, Caspase-3 activity assay, Granzyme B activity assay, STD-NMR assay.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measures change in refractive index on a biosensor surface, as analytic mass accumulates via binding to an attached ligand. This allows derivation of affinity (KD) from measured kinetic rates of association (ka) and dissociation (kd). All assays were run at 25°C on a BiOptix 404pi. An NTA biosensor chip was used in this study to pre-concentrate 3μM MBP-Sb9 via an N-terminal His-tag. MBP-Sb9 was covalently immobilized with EDC/NHS in 20mM HEPES pH8.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 5mM βME to 10,000 to 15,000 RUs. MBP was similarly immobilized on a separate channel as a negative control. Compounds were injected as 3-fold serial dilutions in duplicate starting at 200μM. Injections were done at 50μl/min for 60 s, followed by a 120 s dissociation in 20mM HEPES pH8.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 5mM βME, 1% DMSO. A series of five DMSO standards between 0.5% and 1.5% were included with each run to correct for bulk refractive index. Sensorgrams were analyzed using Scrubber 2 software with a double reference and fit to a 1:1 Langmuir model to determine the interaction parameters KD, ka, and kd.
The EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit was used to detect apoptosis by assaying for increases in caspase-3 activities. The basis for the assay is rhodamine 110 bis-(N-CBZ-L-aspartyl-L-glutamyl-L-valyl-L-aspartic acid amide) (Z-DEVD–R110). This substrate is a bisamide derivative of rhodamine 110 (R110) containing DEVD peptides covalently linked to each of R110’s amino groups, thereby suppressing the dye’s visible absorption and its fluorescence. Upon enzymatic cleavage, the nonfluorescent bisamide substrate is converted in a two-step process first to a fluorescent monoamide and then to an even more fluorescent R110. We used the lysate of 1 × 10 6 cells for each reaction. B16 cells were treated with compounds to induce apoptosis. A negative control was prepared by incubating cells in the absence of compounds. The cells were incubated with compounds for 24hr and washed in PBS. Each cell sample or control was resuspended in 50 μL of the 1x cell lysis buffer. Cells were lysed by incubating on ice for 30min, and the lysed cells were centrifuged to pellet the cellular debris. 50 μL of the supernatant was transferred from each sample to individual microplate wells. 50 μL of the 1x cell lysis buffer was used as a no-enzyme control to determine the background fluorescence of the substrate. 50 μL of the 2x substrate working solution was added to each sample and control. The microplate was covered, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for approximately 30min. The fluorescence was measured by a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation/emission ∼496/520 nm) using excitation and emission filters.
The materials for this single cell-based fluorogenic cytotoxicity assay for the measurement of granzyme B activity in live cells are available commercially as the GranToxiLux kit from OncoImmunin. In brief, B16-WT cells were labeled with TFL4 dye (APC) and incubated with Granzyme B substrate from Vial GS (FITC). Cells untreated with the Granzyme B substrate were used as the negative control. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD FACSCantoTM II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric analysis was performed via FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR).
The goal of these experiments was to find a compound that deters the ability of Sb9 to inhibit granzyme B proteolysis. To that end, a granzyme B activity assay was developed to test a number of compounds from the fragment screen hits. The assay is a commercially available kit, the Granzyme B Colorimetric Drug Discovery Kit by Enzo Life Sciences (BML-AK711). In this assay, granzyme B cleaves the peptide substrate Ac-IEPD-pNA to produce the chromophore p-nitroaniline, which is measured by absorbance at 405 nm. The measurements were performed with a LabSystems Multiskan RC plate reader. The appropriate volume of assay buffer was added to the wells of the microplate. 10 μL of tested compound was added to the designated wells. Then, 10 μL of Sb9 protein was added into the designated wells and pre-incubated with the compounds for 1 or 2 hr. 15 μL of GrB was added to the designated wells. Then this mixture was incubated with GrB for 30 min. The reaction was started by adding 50 μL of the 2x Ac-IEPD-pNA substrate solution. 100 ul of pNA at 50 μM was added as a calibration standard, which produced an A405 of ∼0.3. The microplate was read continuously at A405 in a microplate-reading spectrophotometer. The reactions were run for 2hrs, and the reading interval was 10min. Lastly, we obtained the raw data and performed data analysis.
The Saturation-Transfer Difference (STD) NMR assay was used to evaluate the binding of Compound 3034 to Sb9. The STD NMR experiment was performed using 420 μM 3034 and 45 μM Sb9 protein in PBS buffer, pH7.0 with 10% D2O at 25°C, on a 600MHz Bruker Avance II spectrometer equipped with a Prodigy Cryoprobe. The saturation period was 3.0 s with irradiation at 0 ppm (on-resonance excitation) and −20 ppm (off-resonance excitation). The number of scans was 160 for the on and off-resonance spectra respectively. Spectra were processed using Topspin software and apodized with exponential multiplication with 1.0 Hz line-broadening.

Cell clustering was performed by a graph-based clustering approach provided by R package Seurat, clusters were visualized in a t-SNE plot. Gene expression levels of SERPINB9 (Sb9) and GZMB (GrB) in putative cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating T cells (CD4 + and CD8 + ) were extracted for comparation.
All the data were presented as mean ± standard error from at least three times, each done in triplicate. The statistical significance between two groups was determined by Student’s t test, whereas the comparisons of multiple groups were carried out by one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s post-test using GraphPad Prism7 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA). A probability value of ∗ p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
