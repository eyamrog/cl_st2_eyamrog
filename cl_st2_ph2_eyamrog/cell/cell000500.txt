Title: De novo deletions and duplications at recombination hotspots in mouse germlines


Abstract: Summary

Numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) arise during meiosis to initiate homologous recombination. These DSBs are usually repaired faithfully, but here, we uncover a distinct type of mutational event in which deletions form via joining of ends from two closely spaced DSBs (double cuts) within a single hotspot or at adjacent hotspots on the same or different chromatids. Deletions occur in normal meiosis but are much more frequent when DSB formation is dysregulated in the absence of the ATM kinase. Events between chromosome homologs point to multi-chromatid damage and aborted gap repair. Some deletions contain DNA from other hotspots, indicating that double cutting at distant sites creates substrates for insertional mutagenesis. End joining at double cuts can also yield tandem duplications or extrachromosomal circles. Our findings highlight the importance of DSB regulation and reveal a previously hidden potential for meiotic mutagenesis that is likely to affect human health and genome evolution.

Section: Introduction

Meiotic recombination is essential for faithful genome transmission in most sexually reproducing organisms ( Hunter, 2015 31. Hunter, N. Meiotic Recombination: The Essence of Heredity Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7 :a016618 PubMed Google Scholar ). Recombination is initiated by the programmed formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the SPO11 protein ( Keeney, 2001 35. Keeney, S. Mechanism and control of meiotic recombination initiation Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 52 :1-53 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). SPO11 preferentially cuts within narrow genomic regions called hotspots ( Petes, 2001 54. Petes, T.D. Meiotic recombination hot spots and cold spots Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2 :360-369 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tock and Henderson, 2018 65. Tock, A.J. ∙ Henderson, I.R. Hotspots for Initiation of Meiotic Recombination Front. Genet. 2018; 9 :521 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of all DSB hotspots (∼15,000 defined in mouse), only a tiny fraction (∼250–350) experiences a DSB in any single meiosis ( Cole et al., 2012 20. Cole, F. ∙ Kauppi, L. ∙ Lange, J. ...

This quantitative and spatial regulation of hotspot usage involves hierarchical and combinatorial levels of control ( Pan et al., 2011 52. Pan, J. ∙ Sasaki, M. ∙ Kniewel, R. ...

ATM, known for its role in the DNA damage response in mitotic cells ( Shiloh, 2006 60. Shiloh, Y. The ATM-mediated DNA-damage response: taking shape Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31 :402-410 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (472) PubMed Google Scholar ), is activated by meiotic DSBs to limit DSB numbers and to control hotspot usage genome-wide ( Lange et al., 2011 40.

Control of DSB numbers by ATM and its orthologs is conserved, although ATM-deficient mice have the largest reported increase in DSB levels (∼10-fold) ( Checchi et al., 2014 13.

ATM controls meiotic DNA double-strand break formation and recombination and affects synaptonemal complex organization in plants Plant Cell. 2021; 33 :1633-1656 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Control of genome-wide DSB distributions is also conserved ( Mohibullah and Keeney, 2017 49. Mohibullah, N. ∙ Keeney, S. Numerical and spatial patterning of yeast meiotic DNA breaks by Tel1 Genome Res. 2017; 27 :278-288 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In yeasts, Tel1 controls DSB formation locally by suppressing double cutting, that is, simultaneous DSB formation at adjacent hotspots ( Garcia et al., 2015 27. Garcia, V. ∙ Gray, S. ∙ Allison, R.M. ...

USA. 2018; 115 :E9333-E9342 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suppression is strongest at closely spaced hotspots (<10 kb), such that in the absence of Tel1, double cutting at hotspots separated by ∼2 kb is more frequent than expected by chance and ∼10-fold higher than in wild-type. The loss of this Tel1-mediated DSB suppression is thought to contribute to the global increase in DSBs ( Garcia et al., 2015 27. Garcia, V. ∙ Gray, S. ∙ Allison, R.M. ... Tel1(ATM)-mediated interference suppresses clustered meiotic double-strand-break formation Nature. 2015; 520 :114-118 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mohibullah and Keeney, 2017 49. Mohibullah, N. ∙ Keeney, S. Numerical and spatial patterning of yeast meiotic DNA breaks by Tel1 Genome Res. 2017; 27 :278-288 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mouse, double cutting at adjacent hotspots has not been demonstrated but potentially may be even more likely in the absence of ATM, considering the extremely elevated DSB numbers. Accordingly, we previously suggested that ATM may inhibit multiple nearby DSBs ( Lange et al., 2011 40. Lange, J. ∙ Pan, J. ∙ Cole, F. ... ATM controls meiotic double-strand-break formation Nature. 2011; 479 :237-240 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 41. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Normally, most meiotic DSBs are repaired by recombination between homologous chromosomes. Although nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a robust mitotic DSB repair pathway in mice ( Chang et al., 2017 12. Chang, H.H.Y. ∙ Pannunzio, N.R. ∙ Adachi, N. ... Non-homologous DNA end joining and alternative pathways to double-strand break repair Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :495-506 Crossref Scopus (1040) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is thought to be suppressed in meiosis ( Kim et al., 2016 38. Kim, S. ∙ Peterson, S.E. ∙ Jasin, M. ... Mechanisms of germ line genome instability Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 54 :177-187 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, NHEJ can occur in mouse spermatocytes when DSBs are induced by irradiation ( Ahmed et al., 2010 1. Ahmed, E.A. ∙ Philippens, M.E. ∙ Kal, H.B. ...

The consequences of deregulated meiotic DSB formation are not fully understood. We hypothesized that, in the absence of ATM, formation of DSBs that are too numerous or too closely spaced interferes with the meiotic recombination program, eliciting the use of other repair pathways. We reasoned that mutagenic NHEJ, in particular, might become more prevalent because resection defects, which impair homologous recombination in mitotic cells ( Chen et al., 2017 15. Chen, C.C. ∙ Kass, E.M. ∙ Yen, W.F. ... ATM loss leads to synthetic lethality in BRCA1 BRCT mutant mice associated with exacerbated defects in homology-directed repair Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :7665-7670 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), are found in the absence of ATM in meiotic cells ( Joshi et al., 2015 34. Joshi, N. ∙ Brown, M.S. ∙ Bishop, D.K. ...

Yamada, S. ∙ Hinch, A.G. ∙ Kamido, H. ... Molecular structures and mechanisms of DNA break processing in mouse meiosis Genes Dev. 2020; 34 :806-818 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the loss of ATM may cause DSBs to form at similar locations on multiple chromatids—due to the increase in DSB numbers and/or the loss of spatial control—and thus promote NHEJ by damaging the templates needed for recombinational repair.
We tested this hypothesis by asking whether multiple DSBs form at adjacent hotspots in the absence of ATM in mouse spermatocytes and whether they are repaired aberrantly to delete or duplicate the intervening sequences. Further, we asked whether multiple DSBs leading to deletions can occur within an individual hotspot. Our experiments uncovered DSB (mis)repair products, providing insight into the consequences of loss of meiotic DSB control.

Section: Results and discussion

We first cataloged genomic locations at risk for deletion by identifying pairs of closely spaced hotspots in nucleotide-resolution DSB maps obtained by sequencing SPO11-bound oligonucleotides (oligos), a by-product of DSB formation ( Lange et al., 2016 41. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that numerous DSB hotspots are separated by a short genomic distance ( Figure 1 A). For example, ∼6% of 13,436 autosomal SPO11-oligo hotspots in wild-type mice are located within 5 kb of another hotspot, and this percentage nearly doubles (∼10%) in Atm –/– mice, which have more hotspots called (20,417) ( Figure S1 A). Most hotspots in Atm –/– mice are shared with those in wild-type, although a significant fraction are newly called because the few SPO11 oligos that cluster at these sites in wild-type are increased in the mutant ( Lange et al., 2016 41. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A). Newly called hotspots often emerge near shared hotspots, resulting in an increased number of closely spaced hotspots in Atm –/– ( Figure S1 B). Moreover, in addition to the number, the strength of the shared hotspot pairs also disproportionately increases in Atm –/– ( Figure S1 C), at least in part due to the large increase in DSBs at weaker hotspots ( Lange et al., 2016 41. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, although adjacent DSBs may normally be suppressed, this hidden potential for DSBs at adjacent hotspots may be revealed in Atm –/– .
To test for deletions, we selected DSB hotspot pairs that are shared between wild-type and mutant and that contain strong hotspots to increase the chance of simultaneous DSB formation. The chosen hotspot pairs on Chr1 and Chr19 are separated by <2 kb, with hotspots that individually rank in the top quartile of all hotspots in both wild-type and Atm –/– ( Figures 1 B, S1 D, and S2 A). We tested for deletions by performing nested PCR on testis DNA. For both pairs, concurrent DSB formation at the two hotspot centers with precise joining of the DNA ends would give rise to 1.8-kb deletions ( Figures 1 B and S2 A); in practice, deletions would vary in size depending on the location of SPO11 cleavage in any particular cell. To suppress amplification of parental DNA, genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes prior to amplification in some experiments. Nested PCR was performed with input testis DNA equivalent to ∼8,000–16,000 haploid genomes per well for a total of ∼10–15 million haploid genomes per genotype ( Table S1 ).
Smaller PCR products indicative of deletions were observed in Atm –/– ( Figures 1 C and S2 B). In adult Atm –/– mice, the frequencies of deletions at the Chr1 and Chr19 hotspot pairs were 9.14 × 10 −6 and 4.25 × 10 −6 , respectively, per haploid genome ( Figure 1 D; Table S1 ). Deletions were also detected in ATM-proficient cells but were rare. At the Chr19 hotspot pair, the frequencies were 0.15 × 10 −6 and 0.31 × 10 −6 in wild-type and Atm +/– , respectively, reflecting a total of just six events, whereas no deletions were observed in Spo11 –/– . For the Chr1 hotspot pair, only two deletions were observed in ATM-proficient cells, although one was also observed in Spo11 –/– . No deletions were detected in somatic Atm –/– controls at the Chr1 hotspot pair (liver, frequency ≤0.10 × 10 −6 , Table S1 ), indicating that the events observed in testis DNA are meiosis-specific.
Similar results were obtained in juvenile testes at 15 days post partum ( Table S1 ), when wild-type and mutant testes have a similar distribution of prophase I stages. This finding indicates that the increase in deletion frequency is not due to the different cellular composition of mutant testes caused by prophase I arrest of Atm –/– spermatocytes ( Xu et al., 1996 67. Xu, Y. ∙ Ashley, T. ∙ Brainerd, E.E. ... Targeted disruption of ATM leads to growth retardation, chromosomal fragmentation during meiosis, immune defects, and thymic lymphoma Genes Dev. 1996; 10 :2411-2422 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ; Barlow et al., 1998 7. Barlow, C. ∙ Liyanage, M. ∙ Moens, P.B. ... Atm deficiency results in severe meiotic disruption as early as leptonema of prophase I Development. 1998; 125 :4007-4017 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also tested for deletions in DNA from sperm from Atm +/– and Atm +/+ mice. We captured 7 deletions in Atm +/– at the Chr19 hotspot pair (1.09 × 10 −6 per haploid genome), although none from Atm +/+ (≤0.31 × 10 −6 ; Table S1 ). Thus, meiotic deletions can be transmitted into sperm.
It should be noted that testis DNA is derived from germ cells at different stages of development as well as from some somatic cells, such that the germline deletion frequencies we report for testes are underestimated for all genotypes. Even so, meiotic recombination at a well-studied hotspot that has a similar strength as the individual hotspots examined here occurs at a substantially higher frequency (two to three orders of magnitude: 5.8 × 10 −3 noncrossovers per sperm genome) ( Cole et al., 2010 19. Cole, F. ∙ Keeney, S. ∙ Jasin, M. Comprehensive, fine-scale dissection of homologous recombination outcomes at a hot spot in mouse meiosis Mol. Cell. 2010; 39 :700-710 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) than the deletion frequency in Atm –/– . However, taking into account the large number of hotspots located close to one another, the potential to form deletions in meiosis is substantial. For example, considering only hotspot pairs separated by 1–5 kb, we estimated that ∼1% of Atm –/– spermatocytes may carry a deletion ( Table S3 ).
To map deletion breakpoints, we sequenced deletion products from Atm –/– adults and juveniles: 134 from Chr1 and 58 from Chr19 ( Figures 2 A and S2 C; Table S2 ). The distribution of deletion breakpoints resembled the distribution of SPO11 oligos, with breakpoints clustered around hotspot centers ( Figures 2 B, 2C, S2 D, and S2E). Smoothed breakpoint and SPO11-oligo profiles displayed similar shapes, except that breakpoint profiles were slightly wider with more prominent smaller peaks ( Figures 2 D and S2 F). We defined the breakpoint center within each hotspot as the position of the smoothed peak in the breakpoint density, in the same manner as hotspot centers were defined ( Lange et al., 2016 41. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Breakpoint centers closely matched each hotspot centers within 13 to 39 bp. These findings strongly indicate that deletion formation is preceded by concurrent SPO11 cleavage at the two hotspots, providing evidence for double cutting at adjacent DSB hotspots in mouse.
The median deletion lengths were similar to the distances between the DSB hotspot centers (Chr1: 1,954 bp versus 1,825 bp; Chr19: 1,892 bp versus 1,763 bp), as expected from SPO11 cleavage of both hotspots and joining of unprocessed or minimally processed DNA ends. Accordingly, many deletions had breakpoints within the narrow (251 bp) central zones around the hotspot centers that contained the majority (>60%) of SPO11 oligos. Nearly half of the deletions had one breakpoint within the central zone of one hotspot (Chr1, 41%; Chr19, 45%) and ∼20% had both breakpoints within the central zone (Chr1, 21%; Chr19, 19%) ( Figure S3 A). Although the number of deletions with both breakpoints within the zone was lower than predicted from the SPO11-oligo counts (Chr1, 65%; Chr19, 48%; Figure S3 B), it was notable that breakpoints outside the zone were not evenly distributed. Instead, some clusters could be observed that overlapped with, but were more prominent than, SPO11-oligo clusters ( Figures 2 B–2D and S2 D–S2F). The overlap of breakpoints and SPO11 oligos implies that DSB ends are usually joined close to the initial SPO11 cleavage sites, whereas the wider distribution of deletion breakpoints may reflect preferential deletion formation for DSBs further from the hotspot center, DNA end processing prior to joining, or multiple DSBs within the same hotspot (see below).
In principle, deletions could arise from single DSBs at one hotspot that are asymmetrically resected. However, this seems highly unlikely, given that both breakpoints usually map in the vicinity of separate hotspots, even with the omission of the restriction digest step ( Figure S2 G). Moreover, end-joining at single, unprocessed DSBs is predicted to be error-free due to the presence of 2-bp 5′ overhangs after SPO11 cleavage ( Yamada et al., 2020 69. Yamada, S. ∙ Hinch, A.G. ∙ Kamido, H. ... Molecular structures and mechanisms of DNA break processing in mouse meiosis Genes Dev. 2020; 34 :806-818 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hatkevich et al., 2021 30. Hatkevich, T. ∙ Miller, D.E. ∙ Turcotte, C.A. ... A pathway for error-free non-homologous end joining of resected meiotic double-strand breaks Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :879-890 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although our assay is not designed to detect small deletions at a single hotspot, we address this question below.
Notably, the frequency of deletions in Atm –/– at both hotspot pairs is ∼100 times lower than the frequency of double cutting estimated from SPO11-oligo read counts with the assumption of independent cutting ( Table S3 ). Thus, it seems likely that only a subset of double cuts undergoes end joining, whereas the others are correctly repaired, misrepaired by other mechanisms, or not repaired at all, given that Atm –/– spermatocytes accumulate unrepaired DSBs ( Barchi et al., 2005 5. Barchi, M. ∙ Mahadevaiah, S. ∙ Di Giacomo, M. ... Surveillance of different recombination defects in mouse spermatocytes yields distinct responses despite elimination at an identical developmental stage Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25 :7203-7215 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In wild-type and Atm +/– , several deletions had breakpoints that were identical to those observed in Atm –/– , whereas the one deletion obtained from Spo11 –/– had both breakpoints comparatively far from the hotspot centers ( Figures 2 A and S2 C). However, most of the deletion breakpoints in wild-type and Atm +/– were not within the narrow central zone (251 bp) of SPO11 oligos around the hotspot centers. For example, 12 deletions (86%) at the Chr19 hotspot pair had both breakpoints outside this zone; although more spread out, breakpoints still appeared to often cluster where SPO11 oligos clustered ( Figure S3 C). These observations suggest that in the presence of ATM, deletions may be more prone to occur for DSBs formed outside of hotspot centers or the DSBs involved in the deletion may be more processed.
The meiotic deletions we observe could arise from two DSBs on a single chromatid or DSBs on two chromatids. Moreover, double cutting produces four DNA ends, with the potential to give rise to other mutational outcomes. In particular, DSBs on two chromatids can generate tandem duplications as well as deletions, while two DSBs on one chromatid can release a DNA fragment with the potential to circularize ( Figure 3 A). Finally, DSBs on homologous chromosomes may provoke inter-homolog end-joining. We investigated each of these possibilities.
We used outward-directed (inverse) PCR, which would give a product from either a tandem duplication or circular DNA (duplication/circle) arising from double cutting ( Figure 3 A). In Atm –/– testis DNA, duplication/circle products were readily detected ( Figure 3 B) at a frequency of 2.17 × 10 −5 per haploid genome for the Chr1 hotspot pair (42 events) and 2.20 × 10 −5 for the Chr19 pair (22 events) ( Figure S4 A). (We excluded a fraction of products that we were unable to fully sequence due to the presence of palindromes at the junctions, the origin of which is unclear; see Figure S4 A.) Both hotspot pairs showed similar breakpoint distributions, with some breakpoints clustering at the most prominent SPO11-oligo peaks while others clustered between the two hotspots ( Figure 3 C) (see below).
Next, we aimed to distinguish circular DNA junctions from those of duplications to determine if both events occur. To this end, genomic DNA was incubated with E. coli exonuclease V (also known as RecBCD) prior to inverse PCR to specifically degrade linear DNA containing duplications while leaving circles intact ( Figures 3 D and S4 B). We cleaved DNA with a restriction enzyme with sites flanking the hotspot pair to further ensure ExoV degradation, which was confirmed with a control PCR ( Figure S4 B). Using this approach at the Chr1 hotspot pair, we recovered 13 products from reactions with ExoV, which are predicted to arise only from circles, and a significantly larger number (27) without ExoV (p = 0.0269, chi-square test; Figures 3 E and S4 C). This result provides evidence that tandem duplications and circles both occur in Atm –/– testis DNA, and in roughly similar numbers. A few presumptive tandem duplications were also detected in Atm +/+ sperm DNA ( Figure S4 C), although further investigation is required.
The circle and duplication/circle breakpoint distributions were similar, indicating that end joining positions are not dramatically different within the hotspot pair despite involving DSBs on different numbers of chromatids ( Figures 3 C and 3E). Distances between the breakpoints, which indicate the duplication length or the circle size, were likewise similar (Chr1: circles, 1,267 bp median; duplications/circles, 1,287 bp median). In contrast, these distances were significantly smaller than those of deletions (1,954 bp median; p < 0.0001, unpaired Mann-Whitney test). Similar findings were obtained for the Chr19 hotspot pair (median deletion size was 1,892 bp, compared with 1,348 bp for duplications/circles; p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test; Figure 3 C). This difference was because duplication/circle breakpoints mapped between hotspot centers (64%–87%), whereas the majority of deletion breakpoints mapped outside (53%–76%, Figure 3 F). These shifts were highly significant ( Figure S4 D) and are consistent with multiple DSBs within hotspots and/or joining of partially resected DSB ends, because both scenarios would yield larger deletions and smaller duplications and circles ( Figure S4 E).
Interestingly, for duplications/circles only one of the two major breakpoint peaks in each pair was close to the hotspot center. The other peak was shifted ∼500 bp inward (Chr1 left hotspot, Chr19 right hotspot, Figure 3 F). This shift may be the result of frequent double cuts at these two hotspots, with one cut at the hotspot center and the other ∼500 bp away. Supporting this, a small cluster of SPO11 oligos is observed at this position in the Chr19 right hotspot ( Figure 3 F) and is also seen in the Chr1 left hotspot when SPO11 oligos mapping to repeats are included ( Figure S4 F). Deletions that would be predicted to arise from double cuts at the Chr1 left hotspot were confirmed using flanking primers (14 events in Atm –/– , 1.75 × 10 −6 ; two events in Atm +/– , 0.25 × 10 −6 ), with the right breakpoints frequently mapping to the shifted peak ( Figure S4 G). Left breakpoints mapped predominantly outside the hotspot center, implying that double cuts can be more distant than expected or that more than two cuts can form.
Overall, our results provide evidence for multiple mutational outcomes arising from double cutting and end joining in the absence of ATM. Moreover, as circles and tandem duplications are not predicted to arise from a single DSB, their occurrence provides strong evidence for double cutting at two DSB hotspots on either one or two chromatids.
To investigate whether deletions involve one or both homologs, we tested the Chr1 hotspot pair in B6 × DBA/2J (DBA) F1 hybrid males, which have a high polymorphism density across this region ( Figure 4 ). Primers were shifted to amplify a larger fragment to aid in identifying the parental chromosome(s) involved in the deletion.
We recovered 37 deletions from Atm –/– testis DNA for a frequency of 4.20 × 10 −6 per haploid genome, but none in the presence of ATM (<0.16 × 10 −6 ) ( Table S1 ). The distributions of deletion sizes (median 2,046 bp) and breakpoints were broadly similar to those from B6 inbred mice ( Figures 4 and S5 B). When we analyzed polymorphisms, 30 of the 34 informative deletions (88%) appeared to have originated within one chromosome: 10 on B6 and 20 on DBA ( Figure 4 ). The higher frequency of deletions on the DBA chromosome might be associated with a polymorphism in the PRDM9 binding site at the left hotspot ( Figures 4 and S5 A), which could positively affect DSB formation. Thus, the preponderance of deletions arise within one chromosome, involving either one chromatid or sister chromatids.
Strikingly, however, we also captured four deletions that contained sequences from both homologs ( Figure 4 ). In one, the left hotspot from DBA was joined to the right hotspot from B6 (DBA-Δ-B6). In the other three more complex events, a haplotype switch occurred adjacent to one of the deletion breakpoints (DBA-B6-Δ-B6; DBA-B6-Δ-DBA, and B6-DBA-Δ-?, where the question mark indicates that the genotype was uninformative at the right end). In these haplotype switches, 6–8 polymorphisms were incorporated, encompassing up to 500 bp ( Figure 4 ).
The recovery of deletions involving interhomolog interactions shows that DSBs can occur at nearby locations on both homologs in the same cell, at least in Atm –/– . Thus, although homolog synapsis is greatly impaired in the absence of ATM ( Xu et al., 1996 67. Xu, Y. ∙ Ashley, T. ∙ Brainerd, E.E. ... Targeted disruption of ATM leads to growth retardation, chromosomal fragmentation during meiosis, immune defects, and thymic lymphoma Genes Dev. 1996; 10 :2411-2422 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ; Barlow et al., 1998 7.

Atm deficiency results in severe meiotic disruption as early as leptonema of prophase I Development. 1998; 125 :4007-4017 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), homolog interactions still occur. Cutting of both homologs at the same hotspot has been inferred from patterns of strand exchange in yeast tetrads ( Zhang et al., 2011 71. Zhang, L. ∙ Kim, K.P. ∙ Kleckner, N.E. ... Meiotic double-strand breaks occur once per pair of (sister) chromatids and, via Mec1/ATR and Tel1/ATM, once per quartet of chromatids Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2018; 70 :9-20.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Further, the three complex interhomolog events suggest that three or more DSBs had occurred on the two homologs. One possible mechanism for the haplotype switch at a deletion breakpoint is offset DSB formation on both homologs within the same hotspot, with attempted gap repair that is aborted by the DSB in the template, followed by joining to a DSB at the other hotspot ( Figure S5 C). Alternatively, double cutting within one hotspot on one homolog might release a DNA fragment that then inserts at the DSB in the other homolog ( Figure S5 D). Irrespective of the precise mechanism, however, these results indicate that loss of ATM can cause damage to multiple chromatids.
Most deletions between hotspots from Atm –/– mice were unique: 87% (161/185) of events on Chr1 were observed only once, as were 97% (56/58) for Chr19 ( Table S2 ). Microhomologies were present at the breakpoints in 75% of all deletions, but they were generally short, with a median of 1 bp for both the Chr1 and Chr19 deletions ( Figure 5 A). This frequency is larger than the 44% expected by chance ( Figure 5 A; STAR Methods ). Thus, substantial microhomology is not required for joining, but short overlaps may be favored.
The 24 recurring deletions on Chr1 had longer microhomologies with a median of 6 bp ( Table S4 ). Twelve of the recurring deletions arose within a 22/23-bp imperfect repeat shared between the two hotspots and eight of these involved an 8-bp microhomology within the repeat ( Figure 5 B; Table S4 ). Thus, the presence and position of short sequence repeats likely influences deletion outcomes.
The presence or absence of microhomologies within end-joining products may be indicative of the end joining pathway used and/or processing at DNA ends. For example, SPO11-bound DSB ends normally require endonucleolytic processing on one strand by MRE11 to release SPO11 oligos ( Keeney et al., 1997 36. Keeney, S. ∙ Giroux, C.N. ∙ Kleckner, N.

This may disfavor canonical nonhomologous end-joining and promote alternative pathways that utilize microhomology ( Sfeir and Symington, 2015 59. Sfeir, A. ∙ Symington, L.S.

However, as some DSBs remain unresected in the absence of ATM/Tel1 ( Joshi et al., 2015 34. Joshi, N. ∙ Brown, M.S. ∙ Bishop, D.K. ...

Molecular structures and mechanisms of DNA break processing in mouse meiosis Genes Dev. 2020; 34 :806-818 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ), deletions may also arise from joining at or very close to SPO11 cleavage positions, which would involve alternative SPO11 removal mechanisms, such as TDP2 ( Álvarez-Quilón et al., 2014 2. Álvarez-Quilón, A. ∙ Serrano-Benítez, A. ∙ Lieberman, J.A. ... ATM specifically mediates repair of double-strand breaks with blocked DNA ends Nat.

Paiano, J. ∙ Wu, W. ∙ Yamada, S. ... ATM and PRDM9 regulate SPO11-bound recombination intermediates during meiosis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :857 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings are thus consistent with multiple end-joining mechanisms being employed to repair adjacent DSBs in the absence of ATM.
Unexpectedly, we observed insertions in 11% of deletions from Atm –/– mice (27/243; two deletions with two inserts, for 29 total inserts; Table S2 ). All but one of the inserted DNA fragments mapped to chromosome positions that showed SPO11 activity, either the assayed hotspot pairs themselves or other hotspots. The insert that mapped to a sequence with no SPO11 oligos contained a CT-rich microsatellite repeat and shared significant microhomology with both deletion breakpoints (12 and 9 bp) ( Table S5 ), suggesting a possible DNA synthesis-based insertion mechanism.
Fifteen inserts of 15–349 bp mapped to other chromosome positions, either at hotspots or at SPO11-oligo clusters that were below the hotspot-calling threshold ( Figures 6 A–6C and S6 A–S6C; Table S5 ). Microhomologies at both sides of inserts were often short (0 to 2 bp), similar to deletions without insertions ( Figure 6 D; Table S5 ).
Most of these inserts could be uniquely mapped, but three were derived from the non-pseudoautosomal region (non-PAR) of the Y chromosome. The mouse non-PAR Y is highly ampliconic ( Soh et al., 2014 62. Soh, Y.Q. ∙ Alföldi, J. ∙ Pyntikova, T. ... Sequencing the mouse Y chromosome reveals convergent gene acquisition and amplification on both sex chromosomes Cell. 2014; 159 :800-813 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ), so these inserts cannot be assigned to a single location. Hotspots have been called at some of these locations based on the assignment of unique SPO11 oligos, although most SPO11 oligos map to multiple locations that are highly similar ( Figures 6 B, 6C, S6 B, and S6C; Table S5 ). Among all chromosomes, the non-PAR Y experiences the largest increase in SPO11-oligo density in the absence of ATM (∼30-fold) ( Lange et al., 2016 41. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Inserts came from sites at or close to hotspot/cluster centers: nearly half had an end within 50 bp ( Figure 6 B). Their sizes were small (median, 106 bp) even though larger inserts would have been detectable ( Figures S6 C and S6D). We envision that these inserts derive from DNA fragments released by SPO11 double cutting; we infer that they were not circularized because they are not permuted. It seems remarkable that inserts can sometimes originate from weak SPO11-oligo clusters, as such weak sites would be unlikely to experience two DSBs in the same cell if each DSB occurred independently at a population-average frequency. However, these findings are readily explained by the recent observation of concerted SPO11 double cleavage within hotspots (especially in Atm –/– ) ( Johnson et al., 2021 33. Johnson, D. ∙ Crawford, M. ∙ Cooper, T. ... Concerted cutting by Spo11 illuminates meiotic DNA break mechanics Nature. 2021; 594 :572-576 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Prieler et al., 2021 56. Prieler, S. ∙ Chen, D. ∙ Huang, L. ... Spo11 generates gaps through concerted cuts at sites of topological stress Nature. 2021; 594 :577-582 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ectopic insertion of SPO11-generated fragments into other SPO11-generated DSB locations represents a distinct pathway for meiosis-specific, nonreciprocal genome modification by translocation of sequences.
Twelve deletions had insertions of 16 to 709 bp that mapped to one of the hotspots but were reinserted in opposite orientation (inverted insertions; Figures 6 E, S6 C, and S6E; Table S6 ), including one with an inverted insertion from each hotspot in the pair. Reconstructing the insertion breakpoints illuminated potential inversion mechanisms. Specifically, in each case, one insertion breakpoint shared an inverted microhomology with one deletion breakpoint (median, 5 bp) ( Figures 6 F and 6G; Table S6 ). The other insertion breakpoint, which was at or near this deletion breakpoint, had no or little microhomology with the other deletion breakpoint (median, 0 bp). Inserts from the left and right hotspots mirrored each other in the sense that those from the left hotspot had the longer microhomology at the right breakpoint, whereas those from the right hotspot had the longer microhomology at the left breakpoint ( Figures 6 E, 6G, and S6 E; Table S6 ). Insert sequences clustered around hotspot centers ( Figure 6 H), indicating that they originated from DSB formation.
We propose two models to explain these events ( Figure 6 F). In one, DSBs occur at or near the two inverted microhomologies, creating a small double-cut fragment within one hotspot, and a third DSB in the other hotspot generates a larger fragment destined for deletion. One end of the small fragment remains unprocessed, preventing normal recombination at this hotspot, while both ends with the inverted microhomology are at least partially resected, allowing strand annealing and fragment inversion. The unprocessed end of the now inverted fragment joins to the third DSB at the other hotspot. This is an attractive model because it incorporates defects seen or inferred in Atm –/– mice, namely, impaired DSB processing ( Paiano et al., 2020 51. Paiano, J. ∙ Wu, W. ∙ Yamada, S. ... ATM and PRDM9 regulate SPO11-bound recombination intermediates during meiosis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :857 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamada et al., 2020 69. Yamada, S. ∙ Hinch, A.G. ∙ Kamido, H. ... Molecular structures and mechanisms of DNA break processing in mouse meiosis Genes Dev. 2020; 34 :806-818 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ) and closely spaced DSBs ( Johnson et al., 2021 33. Johnson, D. ∙ Crawford, M. ∙ Cooper, T. ... Concerted cutting by Spo11 illuminates meiotic DNA break mechanics Nature. 2021; 594 :572-576 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; this study). In the second model, a DSB occurs next to just one of the inverted microhomologies and resection exposes the second microhomology. A foldback structure formed by annealing the inverted microhomologies is further processed by a structure-specific nuclease, generating a 5′ overhang that is filled in prior to joining the DSB end at the other hotspot. Foldback structures may be common in Atm –/– , because the excess of DSBs may exhaust the pool of RPA ( Toledo et al., 2013 66. Toledo, L.I. ∙ Altmeyer, M. ∙ Rask, M.B. ... ATR prohibits replication catastrophe by preventing global exhaustion of RPA Cell. 2013; 155 :1088-1103 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (623) PubMed Google Scholar ), which normally prevents formation of secondary structures ( Chen et al., 2013 14. Chen, H. ∙ Lisby, M. ∙ Symington, L.S. RPA coordinates DNA end resection and prevents formation of DNA hairpins Mol. Cell. 2013; 50 :589-600 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, four inverted insertions from the right hotspot at the Chr1 hotspot pair involved the previously identified recurrent deletion site ( Figures 5 B and S6 E). In this case, 13 bp overlapping the recurrent deletion shares inverted microhomology with the most prominent DSB peak. Thus, this genomic location often engages in inappropriate repair (9% of all Chr1 deletions), demonstrating that DSB formation at or nearby such sequences may cause (mis)repair products to arise.
If more than one DSB can form inside the same hotspot, and not just at adjacent hotspots, we predict that small deletions might also arise within single hotspots. The presumed origin of insertions from hotspot fragments implies that closely spaced DSBs can indeed occur within individual hotspots on one chromatid. We applied deep sequencing to test for such microdeletions. We selected a hotspot on Chr1 ranked among the five strongest in both Atm –/– and wild-type. The SPO11-oligo profile for this hotspot displays a major central peak, a secondary peak, and several minor peaks, with SPO11 oligos spreading up to ∼500 bp on both sides of the central peak, especially to the right ( Figure 7 A). We designed four overlapping amplicons, ∼580 bp each, to scan ∼900 bp of the hotspot. This strategy would recover deletions around the major peak as well as those with one or both breakpoints away from the major peak, as often seen for inserts ( Figure 7 B). Multiple, independent PCRs were carried out, each with input testis DNA equivalent to ∼16,000 haploid genomes, for a total of ∼10 million per amplicon. From pools of amplified DNA we sequenced ∼3.5–5 million molecules per amplicon.
We identified reads containing microdeletions ranging from 11–229 bp ( Figure 7 A) (reads with ≤10-bp deletions were not considered) ( Figure S7 A). In Atm –/– , 216 reads with microdeletions were detected from the four amplicons, for a total frequency of 1.58 × 10 −5 , significantly greater than in Spo11 –/– (0.19 × 10 −5 ), wild-type (0.54 × 10 −5 ), and Atm +/– (0.23 × 10 −5 ) (p < 0.0001, chi-square test) ( Table S7 ). For some amplicons, reads from wild-type and Atm +/– were also more frequent than in Spo11 –/– ( Table S7 ). If we disregard duplicate reads for a specific microdeletion from a given amplicon, we conservatively estimate that we obtained 149 independent microdeletions in total from Atm –/– ( Figure 7 A). This is likely an underestimate because some microdeletions were found in multiple amplicons ( Figure S7 B).
Microdeletion breakpoints frequently clustered at SPO11-oligo sites in Atm –/– ( Figure 7 A). Prominent clusters were observed at the major SPO11-oligo peak (amplicons 1 to 3) and at the secondary SPO11-oligo peak (amplicons 1 to 4), indicating that microdeletions arose from SPO11-generated DSBs. This was even more evident when we pooled the 82 independent microdeletions from amplicons 1, 2, and 3 for which both breakpoints mapped within the 304-bp overlapping region (i.e., between the forward primer of amplicon 3 and the reverse primer of amplicon 1) ( Figure 7 B). It was visually striking that many microdeletions had both breakpoints within these two SPO11-oligo peaks (17/82; 21%, 3 of which were recurring; Figure S7 B), implying that they originated from double cutting. In the smoothed breakpoint profiles, the most prominent left breakpoint peak matched the major SPO11-oligo peak, whereas the most prominent right breakpoint peak matched the secondary SPO11-oligo peak ( Figure 7 C). These breakpoint peaks became even more prominent when all 116 reads in this overlap region were considered, something not seen with random sampling of reads ( Figure S7 C). Thus, at least some of the duplicated reads likely represent independent microdeletions.
Microdeletions in the overlap region displayed a distinct length distribution ( Figure 7 D), with two prominent microdeletion classes of ∼30 bp and ∼60 bp. The ∼60-bp microdeletions predominantly mapped between the major SPO11-oligo peak and the secondary SPO11-oligo peak (71%, 17/24 from 49–70 bp; Figure 7 E), which are separated by 55 bp ( Figure 7 C); reads within this class were often duplicated ( Figure S7 D). A subset of the ∼30-bp microdeletions (22%, 4/18 from 27–42 bp) ( Figure 7 E) mapped between a minor SPO11-oligo peak and the secondary SPO11-oligo peak 34 bp away ( Figure 7 C). These results imply that hotspot substructure predicts double cutting and, hence, microdeletion locations. Conversely, double cutting will affect SPO11-oligo distribution within a hotspot when SPO11 oligos predominantly arise from double cutting.
In addition to microdeletions between two SPO11-oligo peaks, ∼30-bp (56%, 10/18) and ∼60-bp (21%, 5/24) microdeletions often had only one breakpoint at a SPO11-oligo peak ( Figure 7 E). Assuming they also arose from two SPO11 breaks, the distinct size classes may reflect a more general underlying mechanism for double cutting, such that the length of double-cut fragments may be constrained. In that case, it remains possible that some of the ∼60-bp microdeletions may have arisen from two double cuts (triple cutting), releasing two ∼30-bp fragments, rather than a single double cut, although this may be less likely given that very few of the ∼30-bp microdeletions have left breakpoints within the major SPO11-oligo peak like the ∼60-bp microdeletions.
Microdeletions, especially the ∼60-bp class, frequently removed the PRDM9 binding site ( Figure 7 E). PRDM9 binding could potentially affect the spacing of double cuts. However, because similar microdeletion lengths are observed outside the PRDM9 motif, another or additional factors must exist that lead to this size class.
Interestingly, the major SPO11-oligo peak and the adjacent minor peak are separated by 21 bp ( Figure 7 C), but the few small microdeletions (11–24 bp) did not map between these peaks ( Figures 7 D and 7E), implying that two SPO11-induced DSBs may be constrained to longer distances. Such a constraint implies that microdeletions arise from two DSBs in one chromatid (gaps), rather than from two single DSBs forming independently on two chromatids.
A less prominent microdeletion class of ∼140 bp was also observed (129–153 bp, Figure 7 D). In several of these longer microdeletions, the left breakpoints clustered at the major SPO11-oligo peak, and the right breakpoints were at sites with fewer SPO11 oligos (46%, 6/13; Figure 7 E). These longer microdeletions may also arise from double cutting. Long SPO11 oligos are observed in Atm –/– testes ( Lange et al., 2011 40. Lange, J. ∙ Pan, J. ∙ Cole, F. ... ATM controls meiotic double-strand-break formation Nature. 2011; 479 :237-240 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ), but are underrepresented in SPO11-oligo maps because of size selection during library preparation ( Thacker et al., 2014 63. Thacker, D. ∙ Mohibullah, N. ∙ Zhu, X. ... Homologue engagement controls meiotic DNA break number and distribution Nature. 2014; 510 :241-246 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lange et al., 2016 41. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even longer microdeletions were also observed that peaked at ∼180 bp and ∼230 bp ( Figure 7 D), especially when considering all amplicons where microdeletions were less size-constrained ( Figures S7 E and S7F). Some of these long microdeletions may have arisen from multiple double-cut fragments that generated long gaps. However, it is notable that the median insert size from other hotspots in the paired hotspot deletions was quite long (∼100 bp), with one insert extending 349 bp, suggesting that long double-cut fragments can be generated.
In Atm +/+ and Atm +/– , microdeletions did not display obvious spatial patterns ( Figures 7 A and 7E). Because the frequency of microdeletions in the presence of ATM is only slightly higher in some amplicons than in Spo11 –/– , we consider that a portion of these events arose from PCR errors or other genomic damage, as in Spo11 –/– . Strikingly, however, an ∼30-bp (25- to 43-bp) microdeletion class was also apparent, but not in the Spo11 –/– control, although the prominent ∼60-bp microdeletion class found in Atm –/– was not observed ( Figures 7 D and S7 E). Microdeletions from the ∼30-bp class did not map within SPO11-oligo peaks, although some breakpoints clustered ( Figure 7 E). Possibly, in the presence of ATM, microdeletions are more likely to occur at DSBs formed outside of SPO11-oligo peaks. In both the presence and absence of ATM, microhomology at breakpoints was generally short (median 1 bp) ( Figure S7 G), similar to deletions between hotspot pairs.
Our assumption that SPO11 double cutting occurs within individual hotspots, preceding microdeletion formation, is consistent with recent findings from S. cerevisiae in which double-cut fragments were observed ( Johnson et al., 2021 33. Johnson, D. ∙ Crawford, M. ∙ Cooper, T. ... Concerted cutting by Spo11 illuminates meiotic DNA break mechanics Nature. 2021; 594 :572-576 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Prieler et al., 2021 56. Prieler, S. ∙ Chen, D. ∙ Huang, L. ... Spo11 generates gaps through concerted cuts at sites of topological stress Nature. 2021; 594 :577-582 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Their minimum size was determined to be ∼30 bp but longer fragments in increments of ∼10 bp were abundant as well. The authors suggest models in which Spo11 is constrained to make the simultaneous cleavages. The recent finding of condensates of the yeast DSB-formation machinery suggests a mechanism whereby centers of DSB activity form which could provide such a platform ( Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2021 16. Claeys Bouuaert, C. ∙ Pu, S. ∙ Wang, J. ... DNA-driven condensation assembles the meiotic DNA break machinery Nature. 2021; 592 :144-149 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our single hotspot data fit well with both of these concepts. Further, potential SPO11 double-cut fragments have been computationally identified within mouse hotspots ( Johnson et al., 2021 33. Johnson, D. ∙ Crawford, M. ∙ Cooper, T. ... Concerted cutting by Spo11 illuminates meiotic DNA break mechanics Nature. 2021; 594 :572-576 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) from SPO11-oligo libraries ( Lange et al., 2016 41.

The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Assuming a similar lower size limit in mouse as in yeast, double-cut fragments are predicted to peak at ∼32 bp and extend to ≤60 bp in Atm –/– , near the size limit of the SPO11-oligo library preparation ( Lange et al., 2016 41.

Our analysis of microdeletions is in line with this finding, given a prominent microdeletion class of ∼30 bp, but also suggests that SPO11-oligo double-cut fragments extend much longer (i.e., from ≥60 bp to at least ∼230 bp), congruent with the observation of long SPO11 oligos in Atm –/– ( Lange et al., 2011 40. Lange, J. ∙ Pan, J. ∙ Cole, F. ... ATM controls meiotic double-strand-break formation Nature. 2011; 479 :237-240 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our study uncovers an unexpected pathway for germline mutagenesis in mice involving nonhomologous end-joining at SPO11 double cuts and leading to various mutational outcomes. Although pronounced in the absence of ATM, these de novo mutations also occur at low frequency in the presence of ATM. Deletions and tandem duplications result in copy number variations (CNVs), predicting a role in genome evolution ( Collins et al., 2020 22. Collins, R.L. ∙ Brand, H. ∙ Karczewski, K.J. ..., Genome Aggregation Database Production Team, Genome Aggregation Database Consortium A structural variation reference for medical and population genetics Nature. 2020; 581 :444-451 Crossref Scopus (449) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, because ∼50% of hotspots are in genic regions ( Smagulova et al., 2016 61. Smagulova, F. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Pu, Y. ... The evolutionary turnover of recombination hot spots contributes to speciation in mice Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :266-280 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ), SPO11-mediated events could disrupt or otherwise modify gene function. Indeed, in both of our hotspot pairs, deletions and duplications remove and duplicate exons, respectively. The occurrence of events involving two chromosomes also predicts gross rearrangements. Thus, our findings reveal a previously hidden potential in meiosis for mutagenesis and the disruption of genome integrity. Furthermore, double-cut fragments appear to be released from hotspots and inserted at other genomic sites undergoing DSBs, also with mutagenic consequences. Because DNA gaps are thought to initiate a subset of meiotic recombination events as part of the normal meiotic program ( Johnson et al., 2021 33. Johnson, D. ∙ Crawford, M. ∙ Cooper, T. ... Concerted cutting by Spo11 illuminates meiotic DNA break mechanics Nature. 2021; 594 :572-576 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Prieler et al., 2021 56. Prieler, S. ∙ Chen, D. ∙ Huang, L. ... Spo11 generates gaps through concerted cuts at sites of topological stress Nature. 2021; 594 :577-582 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), this raises the question as to how re-insertion of released double-cut fragments is usually suppressed. We speculate that circularization of these fragments could be a mechanism to suppress reintegration into the genome.
Microdeletions resulted in PRDM9 motif deletion in 38% of events in the absence of ATM and 11% in the presence of ATM. By eliminating PRDM9 motifs, such deletions are predicted to shape the recombination landscape, thus influencing genome evolution ( Cole et al., 2014 21. Cole, F. ∙ Baudat, F. ∙ Grey, C. ... Mouse tetrad analysis provides insights into recombination mechanisms and hotspot evolutionary dynamics Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :1072-1080 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Baker et al., 2015 4. Baker, C.L. ∙ Kajita, S. ∙ Walker, M. ... PRDM9 drives evolutionary erosion of hotspots in Mus musculus through haplotype-specific initiation of meiotic recombination PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1004916 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) and potentially contributing to speciation ( Davies et al., 2016 24. Davies, B. ∙ Hatton, E. ∙ Altemose, N. ... Re-engineering the zinc fingers of PRDM9 reverses hybrid sterility in mice Nature. 2016; 530 :171-176 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smagulova et al., 2016 61. Smagulova, F. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Pu, Y. ... The evolutionary turnover of recombination hot spots contributes to speciation in mice Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :266-280 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because PRDM9 drives recombination away from promoters ( Brick et al., 2012 10. Brick, K. ∙ Smagulova, F. ∙ Khil, P. ... Genetic recombination is directed away from functional genomic elements in mice Nature. 2012; 485 :642-645 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ), deletions may be better tolerated in PRDM9-dependent meiotic recombination, including in humans, and in turn have a greater potential impact on human genome evolution. This prediction is supported by recent findings of an enrichment of structural variants (insertions and deletions ≥50 bp) at human DSB hotspots ( Beyter et al., 2021 9. Beyter, D. ∙ Ingimundardottir, H. ∙ Oddsson, A. ... Long-read sequencing of 3,622 Icelanders provides insight into the role of structural variants in human diseases and other traits Nat. Genet. 2021; 53 :779-786 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although short double-cut fragments are observed at single hotspots ( Johnson et al., 2021 33. Johnson, D. ∙ Crawford, M. ∙ Cooper, T. ... Concerted cutting by Spo11 illuminates meiotic DNA break mechanics Nature. 2021; 594 :572-576 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with our observations of microdeletions, our physical evidence for the existence of large double-cut fragments between hotspots relies on the detection of circular DNA. The longevity of linear fragments and their conversion to circles remains to be addressed.
We showed that nonhomologous end-joining at double cuts yields mutational outcomes; however, genetic studies are needed to determine which end joining pathway(s) is responsible. The methods we developed will enable such experiments in various knockout mice in the future.

Mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory where indicated. Atm +/– males on the C57BL/6J (B6) background (B6.129S6- Atm tm1Awb /J; stock #008536) were crossed with B6 females (stock #000664) to establish a breeding colony and to obtain experimental animals. The Atm mutation was previously described ( Barlow et al., 1996 6. Barlow, C. ∙ Hirotsune, S. ∙ Paylor, R. ... Atm-deficient mice: a paradigm of ataxia telangiectasia Cell. 1996; 86 :159-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1281) PubMed Google Scholar ). Atm +/– B6 mice were crossed with Atm +/– DBA/2J (DBA) mice to get F1 hybrid males. Atm +/– mice on the DBA background were obtained by six backcrosses of Atm +/– mice that were partially on an A/J background with DBA inbred mice (stock #000671). The previously described Spo11 mutation ( Baudat et al., 2000 8. Baudat, F. ∙ Manova, K. ∙ Yuen, J.P. ... Chromosome synapsis defects and sexually dimorphic meiotic progression in mice lacking Spo11 Mol. Cell. 2000; 6 :989-998 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (561) PubMed Google Scholar ) was maintained on the B6 background. Animals were fed regular rodent chow with continuous access to food and water. All experiments were conducted according to US Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare regulatory standards and were approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
DNA was isolated from testicular single-cell suspensions to enrich for germ cells. Testis dissociation was based on protocols previously described ( Cole et al., 2014 21. Cole, F. ∙ Baudat, F. ∙ Grey, C. ... Mouse tetrad analysis provides insights into recombination mechanisms and hotspot evolutionary dynamics Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :1072-1080 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gaysinskaya et al., 2014 28. Gaysinskaya, V. ∙ Soh, I.Y. ∙ van der Heijden, G.W. ... Optimized flow cytometry isolation of murine spermatocytes Cytometry A. 2014; 85 :556-565 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. Testes from juvenile 15-day-old and adult 2- to 5-month-old mice were decapsulated and seminiferous tubules incubated at 33°C in 10 mL Gey’s Balanced Salt Solution (GBSS) (Sigma) with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) and 2 μg/ml DNase I (Roche) for 15–20 min, shaking at 500 rpm. After 10 min and at the end of the incubation the tubules were gently pipetted up and down using a transfer pipette. The tubules were washed twice with 10 mL GBSS and digested with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) in 10 mL GBSS, supplemented with 2 μg/ml DNase I, for 25–40 min at 33°C, shaking at 500 rpm. Pipetting up and down was performed at the start, midpoint and end of the incubation. Trypsin was inhibited by adding 10% fetal calf serum. Cell suspension was obtained by repeated pipetting for 2 min and filtration through a 70-μm cell strainer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All of the mutant cell suspension and one-third to one-half of the wild-type cell suspension was transferred to a 15 mL tube and centrifuged for 3 min at 1550 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended by tapping the tube, followed by the addition of 600 μL lysis buffer (200 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml Proteinase K). The lysate was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and incubated overnight at 55°C. Genomic DNA was isolated using phenol-chloroform extraction and alcohol precipitation, with the extraction step repeated twice. DNA was dissolved in 200–400 μL H 2 O, incubated for 1 h at 55°C and overnight at 4°C. DNA concentration was quantified by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA was diluted to ∼200 ng/μl and incubated for another 2–3 h at 37°C to reduce the viscosity of the DNA solution. DNA concentration was measured again three times before freezing. DNA samples were stored at −20°C.
Sperm DNA was isolated as previously described ( Peterson et al., 2020 53. Peterson, S.E. ∙ Keeney, S. ∙ Jasin, M. Mechanistic Insight into Crossing over during Mouse Meiosis Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :1252-1263.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Liver DNA (somatic control) was extracted ( Cole and Jasin, 2011 18. Cole, F. ∙ Jasin, M. Isolation of meiotic recombinants from mouse sperm Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 745 :251-282 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ) from the same Atm –/– mouse as testis DNA.
Deletions were detected by nested PCR using primers flanking the two hotspots of a pair ( Figures 1 B and S2 A). Prior to PCR, genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes to suppress parental DNA amplification, although this step can be omitted ( Figure S2 G). Restriction digestions were performed in a 60 μL volume with 1200 ng of DNA and 4–4.5 μL restriction enzyme(s) (Chr1 hotspot pair: NsiI, NcoI, and BglII or NcoI alone; Chr19 hotspot pair: BamHI or KpnI; New England Biolabs). Reactions were incubated overnight at 37°C followed by an additional 3 h of incubation with a 1.5–2 μL of fresh restriction enzyme(s), then placed on ice before PCR. In the majority of PCRs, 2.5 μL of the digestion reaction was used per PCR, equivalent to 50 ng of genomic DNA, with this DNA concentration being optimal for the estimation of deletion frequencies; 1.25 μL and 5 μl, equivalent to 25 ng and 100 ng, respectively, were also tested. In the experiments with no digestion, 50 ng of DNA template was used per PCR in most cases.
Nested PCR was based on the previously described protocol ( Cole and Jasin, 2011 18. Cole, F. ∙ Jasin, M. Isolation of meiotic recombinants from mouse sperm Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 745 :251-282 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some adjustments. A first round of PCR was performed using the following primers: Chr1_DH_FW1: 5′-GGTCAGGAGGATGGGGAG-3′ and Chr1_DH_RV1: 5′-CCAAGAAGGTGCTTATCGTCC-3′ for the Chr1 hotspot pair, Chr19_DH_FW2: 5′-TGGAATGTAGCCTCTGGCAG-3′ and Chr19_DH_RV2: 5′-GTGCTGTCAGAAGCCGTGG-3′ for the Chr19 hotspot pair, Chr1_DH_DB_FW1: 5′-CCTGGAGACCAAAGCCAC-3′ and Chr1_DH_RV1: 5′-CCAAGAAGGTGCTTATCGTCC-3′ for the Chr1 hotspot pair in B6/DBA F1 hybrids. A second round of PCR was performed using the following primers: Chr1_DH_FW2: 5′-GCCTTGGCTCAAAGTGTCTG-3′ and Chr1_DH_RV2: 5′-TCCCTTCTGCCATCCTTCTG-3′ for the Chr1 hotspot pair, new Chr19_DH_FW2: 5′-CCCAAAGTTGTCCTTGCTTCC-3′ and new Chr19_DH_RV2: 5′-TGGTTTCCAGAGGAGAGGAC-3′ for the Chr19 hotspot pair, Chr1_DH_DB_FW2: 5′-GGCATTGCTTCATTCATGGTCTG-3′ and Chr1_DH_RV2-3: 5′-CATTGTCATCTTGAGCACTCCTC-3′ for the Chr1 hotspot pair in B6/DBA F1 hybrids. The annealing temperature was optimized for each primer pair by gradient PCR with testis genomic DNA of known high quality. DNA samples from different testes were also tested for the appearance of a strong parental PCR band using the primary PCR primers.
For nested PCR, each primary PCR was performed in a 50 μL volume containing: 1x Jeffreys buffer (10x: 450 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.8, 110 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 45 mM MgCl 2 , 67 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 44 μM EDTA, 10 mM each dNTP (Roche), 1.13 mg/ml ultra-pure (non-acetylated) BSA (Invitrogen), 12.5 mM Tris base), 0.2 μM primers, 0.03 U/μl Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.006 U/μl Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Agilent). The primary PCR product (0.6 μl) was treated with S1 nuclease (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 30 min, in a 5 μL volume containing: 0.5x S1 buffer, 0.2 U/μl S1 nuclease and 5 ng/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The reaction was diluted with 45 μL of dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 and 5 ng/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA). 4 μL of the diluted S1 reaction was seeded into the secondary PCR, which was performed in a 20 μL volume containing the same components as the primary PCR. Deletion products were identified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel ( Figures 1 C and S2 B). PCR products smaller than the parental size were excised, purified (Invitrogen PureLink™ Quick Gel Extraction Kit), and Sanger sequenced using primers from the second round of PCR and in some cases additional primers. Diluted S1 reactions were stored at −20°C and used again for secondary PCRs if more PCR product was needed for sequencing.
PCR conditions were tested for each hotspot pair. The best result, that is, the appearance of more intense, smaller PCR products, was obtained when the extension time was shortened (< 60 s/kb) in the primary PCR to inhibit amplification of the longer parental PCR product. The extension time in the secondary PCR was slightly shorter.
Primary PCR conditions were denaturation at 96°C for 2 min, followed by 37 cycles of amplification as follows: denaturation at 96°C for 20 s, annealing at 59°C for 30 s, extension at 65°C for 2 min for the Chr1 and Chr19 hotspot pairs (3.6-kb parental products), and 2 min 30 s for the Chr1 hotspot pair in B6/DBA hybrids (4 kb-parental product). Secondary PCR conditions where the same, but with different extension times: 3 min for the Chr1 and Chr19 hotspot pairs (3.4-kb parental products) and 3 min 30 s for the Chr1 hotspot pair in B6/DBA hybrids (3.9-kb parental products).
For detection of smaller deletions at the Chr1 left hotspot, genomic DNA was digested with NsiI, and nested PCR was performed with the forward primers used to detect deletions in B6/DBA F1 hybrids (see above), and the reverse primers used to detect duplications/circles (see below). Primary and secondary PCR conditions were the same: denaturation at 96°C for 20 s, annealing at 61°C for 30 s, extension at 65°C for 1 min 20 s (2.1-kb parental products).
Sequenced PCR products were analyzed using ApE software ( https://jorgensen.biology.utah.edu/wayned/ape/ ) to identify deletions, microhomologies, and polymorphisms in DNA sequences. The probability of microhomology at a junction of a given length (x) occurring by chance can be calculated for a random DNA sequence using the equation P(x) = (x + 1)(1/4) x (3/4) 2 ( Roth et al., 1985 57. Roth, D.B. ∙ Porter, T.N. ∙ Wilson, J.H. Mechanisms of nonhomologous recombination in mammalian cells Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5 :2599-2607 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ). The probability of fortuitously observing microhomology of 1 bp or greater is thus 1 – P(0) = 0.4375. As a separate test to account for the nonrandom sequence composition around the assayed genomic sites, we shifted observed deletion breakpoints by 10 bp outward. This exercise produced similar microhomology profiles to those expected by chance for unbiased sequence composition, for both hotspot pairs ( Figure 5 A). Deletion breakpoint profiling was performed using R versions 3.4.4 to 3.6.3 ( http://www.r-project.org ). Graphing was performed in R and GraphPad Prism version 8.
Primary and secondary PCR reaction protocols, including S1 digest, were the same as in the nested PCR protocol detecting deletions. For the primary PCR, the following primers were used: Chr1_Inv_FW1: 5′-CACTCATTCCCACTTGGCTC-3′ and Chr1_Inv_RV4: 5′-GGACGCATGATAAGCAAGGAG-3′ for the Chr1 hotspot pair, Chr19_Inv_FW3: 5′-TTCTGAGAGAGTCTTGCATTGG-3′ and Chr19_Inv_RV1: 5′-CCTGTACTGTTCATTCGCCATC-3′ for the Chr19 hotspot pair. For the secondary PCR, the following primers were used: Chr1_Inv_FW2: 5′-CAATCCGATGGCATTTAGATTAGG-3′ and Chr1_Inv_RV5: 5′-GGAGAAATGAGTTAATGAAATAGCC-3′ for the Chr1 hotspot pair, new Chr19_Inv_FW4: 5′-CTCAGTGCTGGAATTACAAGAG-3′ and Chr19_Inv_RV2: 5′-CACTAAACCGGAGTTCGCTG-3′ for the Chr19 hotspot pair. Inverse PCR does not amplify parental DNA. Therefore, we paired each primer with another primer to test for the appearance of the parental PCR product and to optimize the annealing temperature by gradient PCR. These control primers were the same primers we used to detect deletions.
Primary and secondary inverse PCR conditions were the same: 96°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 96°C for 20 s, 61°C for 30 s and 65°C for 3–4 min. For both hotspot pairs, if double cutting occurs at hotspot centers, the expected PCR product is 1.4 kb and 1.3 kb for the primary and secondary PCR, respectively. In our experiments, the median size of secondary PCR products was 702 bp for Chr1 and 844 bp for Chr19. However, the more frequent appearance of smaller PCR products was not due to the extension time.
Inverse PCR product sequencing and further analysis were the same as for deletions.
ExoV (RecBCD; New England Biolabs) was used to degrade linear DNA but not circular DNA. To ensure DNA degradation at the Chr1 hotspot pair we digested genomic DNA with the ScaI restriction enzyme ( Figures 3 D and S4 B). Restriction digestions were performed overnight at 37°C in a 60 μL volume with 1200 ng of DNA, 4 μL ScaI (New England Biolabs), followed by 3 h of incubation with a fresh portion, 2 μl, of the enzyme. Digestions were inactivated at 80°C for 20 min, and placed on ice. Next, reactions were split into two and half was treated with ExoV in a 60 μL final volume containing: 1x CutSmart buffer, 1mM ATP and 0.2 U/μl ExoV (or H 2 O). Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1–2 h and inactivated at 70°C for 30 min, then placed on ice. To remove short oligonucleotides generated by ExoV, 3 μL of Thermolabile ExoI (New England Biolabs) was added to each reaction and samples were incubated for 15 min at 37°C, 5 min at 80°C, then placed on ice.
For each inverse PCR, 2.5 μL of the digestion reaction (+/– ExoV) was used, equivalent to 25 ng of pre-digestion genomic DNA. In parallel, a control PCR was performed to test ExoV efficiency. To this end, an aliquot of the digestion reaction was diluted (1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000), and used in nested PCR with control primers (reverse inverse primers plus forward primers used to detect deletions in B6 × DBA F1 hybrids), amplifying a 2.1-kb PCR product ( Figure S4 B). PCR conditions for inverse PCR and control PCR were the same as described above.
Four ∼580-bp overlapping amplicons of the hotspot ( Figure 7 A) were amplified using the following primer pairs: amplicon 1, Chr1_MiSeq_FW1: 5′-TCATGTCCGGTTTGGATGCC-3′ and Chr1_MiSeq_RV1: 5′-CGAATCAAAGACTCCAGAAGAGG-3′; amplicon 2, Chr1_MiSeq_FW2: 5′-AGTAGCAAGAAGGGCTGGAG-3′ and Chr1_MiSeq_RV2: 5′-AGAGACAGATGTGGAGGCTAAC-3′; amplicon 3, Chr1_MiSeq_FW4: 5′-CTGAATCTCTCCTGGTGTGTC-3′ and Chr1_MiSeq_RV4: 5′-AGGACATTGAATGTTTTTATGGTTC-3′; amplicon 4, Chr1_MiSeq_FW5: 5′-AAACAGAAGAAGCAGTAATGCC-3′ and Chr1_MiSeq_RV5: 5′-GTGTGCAACTGGGTATATTTCAG-3′. For each primer pair the annealing temperature was tested by gradient PCR with testis genomic DNA of known high quality. To minimize PCR bias and jackpot amplification of single deletion events, the number of amplification cycles was determined by when a faint PCR product was first visible, which was 22 cycles for all samples. For each amplicon, PCR conditions were the same: 96°C for 2 min followed by 22 cycles at 96°C for 20 s, 59°C for 30 s and 65°C for 35 s. PCR was performed in a 50 μL total containing 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.3 U Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Agilent) in the Jeffreys buffer described above for nested PCR with 50 ng of testis genomic DNA. Testis DNA was derived from 3-5 different mice for each genotype and amplified independently.
PCRs were carried out in 96-well plates to generate a large number of independently derived PCR products for sequencing. For each amplicon, 576 PCRs were performed with a total of 28.8 μg genomic DNA, equivalent to 9.6 million haploid genomes. PCRs were pooled, and a 1200 μL aliquot was purified and concentrated on spin columns (Invitrogen PureLink™ PCR Purification Kit) as follows: For each 100 μL PCR aliquot, 400 μL binding buffer from the kit was added, and then the sample was applied to the column and centrifuged. This step was repeated 6 times in each of two columns before washing and elution with 37 μL elution buffer. Eluted DNA was combined from the two columns and a 15 μL aliquot was run on a 2% agarose gel to estimate DNA concentration, which was ∼2 ng/μl. The remaining ∼60 μL was submitted to the Integrated Genomics Operation at MSK for library preparation and deep sequencing. The library was prepared by ligation of indexed adaptor sequences using the KAPA HyperPrep Kit (Roche). Sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq (2 × 300-bp paired-end reads). In a single run, libraries from amplicons 1–4 were mixed with 5% PhiX DNA control library (Illumina) and sequenced. Because MiSeq can deliver 15–20 million reads per lane, in our experiment, 3.6–4.8 million reads per amplicon were estimated, which was about 2 times lower than the 9.6 million input DNA templates. With that calculation, not all deletion events were recovered, but most recovered deletions should have yielded only a single read.
We performed 4 MiSeq runs with amplicons from different genotypes ( Figure S7 A). FASTQ sequencing files were analyzed using CRISPResso2 ( Pinello et al., 2016 55. Pinello, L. ∙ Canver, M.C. ∙ Hoban, M.D. ... Analyzing CRISPR genome-editing experiments with CRISPResso Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :695-697 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Clement et al., 2019 17. Clement, K. ∙ Rees, H. ∙ Canver, M.C. ... CRISPResso2 provides accurate and rapid genome editing sequence analysis Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :224-226 Crossref Scopus (671) PubMed Google Scholar ) by the Bioinformatics Core Facility at MSK. Reads were aligned to the reference amplicon sequence and 2.9–5.3 million paired-end reads were mapped per amplicon. Alignments matching the target sequence for the first 20 and last 20 bases and with one deletion event were filtered. Reads with > 1 bp deletion and with no mutations in the sequence were analyzed in R and ApE. Breakpoint distribution analyses and random sampling ( Figure S7 C) were performed in R. Graphs were plotted using R and GraphPad Prism.
SPO11-oligo maps were generated previously (GEO accession number GSE84689 ) ( Lange et al., 2016 41. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice for the Atm –/– dataset “ Atm null 1,” which was used in all the analyses, were on a mixed B6 and 129/Sv strain background. Two Atm +/+ datasets are available, “B6,” from mice on a pure B6 background, and “ Atm wt,” from the same colony as Atm –/– mice. Hotspots selected in this study were called in the “B6” dataset ( Figures 1 B, S1 D, and S2 A), while analysis of hotspot distributions was done with the “ Atm wt” dataset ( Figures 1 A and S1 A–S1C). The “B6” dataset was also used to calculate double cutting frequency per meiosis ( Table S3 ), and check if SPO11 oligos map to the genomic locations from which inserts derived ( Figures S6 A and S6B).
