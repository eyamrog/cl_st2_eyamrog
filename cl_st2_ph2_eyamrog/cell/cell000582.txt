Title: Cross-kingdom expression of synthetic genetic elements promotes discovery of metabolites in the human microbiome


Abstract: Summary

Small molecules encoded by biosynthetic pathways mediate cross-species interactions and harbor untapped potential, which has provided valuable compounds for medicine and biotechnology. Since studying biosynthetic gene clusters in their native context is often difficult, alternative efforts rely on heterologous expression, which is limited by host-specific metabolic capacity and regulation. Here, we describe a computational-experimental technology to redesign genes and their regulatory regions with hybrid elements for cross-species expression in Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and eukaryotes, decoupling biosynthetic capacity from host-range constraints to activate silenced pathways. These synthetic genetic elements enabled the discovery of a class of microbiome-derived nucleotide metabolites—tyrocitabines—from Lactobacillus iners . Tyrocitabines feature a remarkable orthoester-phosphate, inhibit translational activity, and invoke unexpected biosynthetic machinery, including a class of “Amadori synthases” and “abortive” tRNA synthetases. Our approach establishes a general strategy for the redesign, expression, mobilization, and characterization of genetic elements in diverse organisms and communities.

Section: Introduction

High-throughput DNA sequencing has revealed the complete genome sequences of many organisms, establishing a fundamental understanding of genetic variation associated with phenotypic diversity. Phenotypic diversity endows organisms with rich biosynthetic capabilities ( Tobias and Bode, 2019 120. Tobias, N.J. ∙ Bode, H.B. Heterogeneity in bacterial specialized metabolism J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431 :4589-4598 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), permitting adaptation to diverse environments ( Agrawal, 2001 1. Agrawal, A.A. Phenotypic plasticity in the interactions and evolution of species Science. 2001; 294 :321-326 Crossref Scopus (1122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rainey and Travisano, 1998 95. Rainey, P.B. ∙ Travisano, M. Adaptive radiation in a heterogeneous environment Nature. 1998; 394 :69-72 Crossref Scopus (898) PubMed Google Scholar ). The establishment of causal relationships between genotypes and phenotypes can be attained by synthetic biology technologies that probe and manipulate systems at the genetic, metabolic, and regulatory levels ( Lee and Kim, 2015 65. Lee, S.Y. ∙ Kim, H.U. Systems strategies for developing industrial microbial strains Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :1061-1072 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ). Harnessing this diversity has tremendous potential to produce new drugs and programmable cells ( Farkona et al., 2016 40. Farkona, S. ∙ Diamandis, E.P. ∙ Blasutig, I.M.

An important component of the genotype-phenotype axis is the rich arsenal of structurally complex secondary metabolites that mediate interspecies interactions in ecological niches, such as the human microbiome ( Donia and Fischbach, 2015 37.

These metabolites tend to harbor distinct scaffolds that underlie diverse biological activities ( Davison and Brimble, 2019 30. Davison, E.K. ∙ Brimble, M.A. Natural product derived privileged scaffolds in drug discovery Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2019; 52 :1-8 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing valuable molecular leads for medicine and biotechnology ( Newman and Cragg, 2020 85. Newman, D.J. ∙ Cragg, G.M.

PRISM 3: expanded prediction of natural product chemical structures from microbial genomes Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :W49-W54 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ) have revealed the massive untapped microbial biosynthetic capacity to encode bioactive small molecules ( Cimermancic et al., 2014 23.

Insights into secondary metabolism from a global analysis of prokaryotic biosynthetic gene clusters Cell. 2014; 158 :412-421 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, the integrated microbial genomes-atlas of biosynthetic gene clusters (IMG-ABC) ( Palaniappan et al., 2019 91. Palaniappan, K. ∙ Chen, I.A. ∙ Chu, K. ... IMG-ABC v.5.0: an update to the IMG/Atlas of biosynthetic gene clusters KnowledgeBase Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 48 :D422-D430 Google Scholar ) has cataloged 411,009 predicted gene clusters sourced from 70,277 genomes. Of these, only a small fraction (1,926) has been experimentally verified (MIBiG) ( Kautsar et al., 2020 56. Kautsar, S.A. ∙ Blin, K. ∙ Shaw, S. ... MIBiG 2.0: a repository for biosynthetic gene clusters of known function Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :D454-D458 PubMed Google Scholar ). The tools needed to functionally interrogate and structurally characterize the growing body of “orphan” (i.e., structurally uncharacterized) pathways are limited ( Covington et al., 2021 25. Covington, B.C. ∙ Xu, F. ∙ Seyedsayamdost, M.R. A natural product chemist’s guide to unlocking silent biosynthetic gene clusters Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2021; 90 :763-788 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The characterization of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in their native hosts is impeded by numerous factors. A significant fraction of environmental strains are not readily cultured ( Bodor et al., 2020 14. Bodor, A. ∙ Bounedjoum, N. ∙ Vincze, G.E. ... Challenges of unculturable bacteria: environmental perspectives Rev. Environ. Sci. Biotechnol. 2020; 19 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar ). When cultivation is tractable, many BGCs are silenced under laboratory conditions ( Ren et al., 2017 97. Ren, H. ∙ Wang, B. ∙ Zhao, H. Breaking the silence: new strategies for discovering novel natural products Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2017; 48 :21-27 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scherlach and Hertweck, 2021 104. Scherlach, K. ∙ Hertweck, C. Mining and unearthing hidden biosynthetic potential Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :3864 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) or exhibit variable strain- and culture condition-specific expression patterns ( Amos et al., 2017 3. Amos, G.C.A. ∙ Awakawa, T. ∙ Tuttle, R.N. ... Comparative transcriptomics as a guide to natural product discovery and biosynthetic gene cluster functionality Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E11121-E11130 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although silent or variably expressed BGCs can be activated through strain engineering ( Sidda et al., 2014 112. Sidda, J.D. ∙ Song, L. ∙ Poon, V. ... Discovery of a family of γ-aminobutyrate ureas via rational derepression of a silent bacterial gene cluster Chem.

CRISPR-Cas9 strategy for activation of silent Streptomyces biosynthetic gene clusters Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 :607-609 Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar ), this strategy relies on the existence of genetic tools for each strain of interest. Additionally, advances in de novo genome assembly directly from metagenomic extracts permit culture-independent prediction of orphan BGCs ( Sugimoto et al., 2019 115. Sugimoto, Y. ∙ Camacho, F.R. ∙ Wang, S. ... A metagenomic strategy for harnessing the chemical repertoire of the human microbiome Science. 2019; 366 :eaax9176 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Transplanting BGCs into tractable model organisms for heterologous expression is a common strategy for BGC characterization ( Li et al., 2015 71. Li, Y. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Yamanaka, K. ... Directed natural product biosynthesis gene cluster capture and expression in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :9383 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ross et al., 2015 99. Ross, A.C. ∙ Gulland, L.E.S. ∙ Dorrestein, P.C. ... Targeted capture and heterologous expression of the Pseudoalteromonas alterochromide gene cluster in Escherichia coli represents a promising natural product exploratory platform ACS Synth. Biol. 2015; 4 :414-420 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the selection of a heterologous host is unpredictable, as BGCs can fail to function due to numerous factors, which include the lack of correct substrate inputs, improper protein folding, toxicity of intermediates, or divergent metabolic outputs ( Casini et al., 2018 19. Casini, A. ∙ Chang, F.-Y. ∙ Eluere, R. ... A pressure test to make 10 molecules in 90 days: external evaluation of methods to engineer biology J. Am. Chem.

Microbiol. 2010; 76 :1633-1641 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the intrinsic promiscuity of biosynthetic enzymes ( Glasner et al., 2020 44. Glasner, M.E. ∙ Truong, D.P. ∙ Morse, B.C. How enzyme promiscuity and horizontal gene transfer contribute to metabolic innovation FEBS J. 2020; 287 :1323-1342 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), molecular outputs can be influenced by the broader metabolic and regulatory context of the host. Within the same genus, different isolates can significantly differ in both the expression and chemical outputs of identical gene clusters ( Iqbal et al., 2016 50. Iqbal, H.A. ∙ Low-Beinart, L. ∙ Obiajulu, J.U. ... Natural product discovery through improved functional metagenomics in Streptomyces J. Am. Chem.

Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2498-2510 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). These challenges motivate new approaches to access and domesticate phylogenetically diverse organisms for the heterologous expression of BGCs ( Wang et al., 2019a 129. Wang, G. ∙ Zhao, Z. ∙ Ke, J. ... CRAGE enables rapid activation of biosynthetic gene clusters in undomesticated bacteria Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2498-2510 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Substantial progress has been made in synthetic biology with respect to the engineering of organisms to assemble complex genetic circuits and expression platforms and thereby achieve remarkable control of biological systems ( Lopatkin and Collins, 2020 74. Lopatkin, A.J. ∙ Collins, J.J. Predictive biology: modelling, understanding and harnessing microbial complexity Nat. Rev.

Genetic circuit design automation Science. 2016; 352 :aac7341 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, biological diversity intrinsically challenges the ability to port synthetic genetic programs from one chassis to another. Due to phylogenetic differences in the maintenance, regulation, and expression of genetic elements, these efforts typically require specialized solutions and optimization for each host and thus remain a defining challenge for the field. To overcome the transcriptional and translational expression bottlenecks ( Lithwick and Margalit, 2003 72. Lithwick, G. ∙ Margalit, H. Hierarchy of sequence-dependent features associated with prokaryotic translation Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2665-2673 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Seyedsayamdost, 2014 107.

USA. 2014; 111 :7266-7271 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), pathways have been refactored transcriptionally ( Yamanaka et al., 2014 137. Yamanaka, K. ∙ Reynolds, K.A. ∙ Kersten, R.D. ... Direct cloning and refactoring of a silent lipopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster yields the antibiotic taromycin A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :1957-1962 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ) and through complete operon redesign ( Smanski et al., 2014 114. Smanski, M.J. ∙ Bhatia, S. ∙ Zhao, D. ... Functional optimization of gene clusters by combinatorial design and assembly Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :1241-1249 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ; Temme et al., 2012 117.

USA. 2012; 109 :7085-7090 Crossref Scopus (268) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, a major challenge is the mobilization, delivery, and stable inheritance of genetic elements into diverse hosts. Plasmid-based mobilization into microbial communities can often lead to a rapid loss of genetic cargo ( Ronda et al., 2019 98. Ronda, C. ∙ Chen, S.P. ∙ Cabral, V. ... Metagenomic engineering of the mammalian gut microbiome in situ Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :167-170 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). To augment stability, strategies such as engineered integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) ( Brophy et al., 2018 16. Brophy, J.A.N. ∙ Triassi, A.J. ∙ Adams, B.L. ... Engineered integrative and conjugative elements for efficient and inducible DNA transfer to undomesticated bacteria Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3 :1043-1053 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) and chassis-independent recombinase-assisted genome engineering (CRAGE) ( Wang et al., 2019a 129. Wang, G. ∙ Zhao, Z. ∙ Ke, J. ... CRAGE enables rapid activation of biosynthetic gene clusters in undomesticated bacteria Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2498-2510 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been used to self-mobilize and chromosomally integrate heterologous cargo in a variety of strains. These and other integrative strategies—e.g., phage-assisted integration, site-specific integrases ( Du et al., 2015 38. Du, D. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Tian, Y. ... Genome engineering and direct cloning of antibiotic gene clusters via phage φBT1 integrase-mediated site-specific recombination in Streptomyces Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :8740 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Cas-transposases ( Rubin et al., 2022 100. Rubin, B.E. ∙ Diamond, S. ∙ Cress, B.F. ... Species- and site-specific genome editing in complex bacterial communities Nat. Microbiol. 2022; 7 :34-47 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar )—have limitations in host range, which remain a focus of active research.
In this study, we present a computational and experimental strategy to redesign multigene biological pathways for mobilization, expression, and characterization in versatile organisms. In our approach ( Figure 1 ), the orphan BGCs are computationally redesigned into synthetic genetic elements (SGEs) and functionalized for expression across diverse hosts. This is enabled by the development of hybrid transcriptional expression signals for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These SGEs are mobilized into both kingdoms, where pathway-targeted metabolomics is used to identify key molecular features and characterize the structures and functions of output metabolites. We demonstrate that this approach can productively animate orphan BGCs, which enabled the discovery of an unexpected route for the biosynthesis of a class of bioactive nucleotide metabolites encoded in the human microbiome. These metabolites expand our knowledge of the biochemistry catalyzed by otherwise canonical genes, such as tRNA synthetases. Ultimately, we anticipate that our technology will establish a broader framework for functionalizing genetic elements across diverse species, including nonmodel organisms and communities.

Section: Results

Expression of BGCs involves sequential layers of control exerted at the level of transcription, translation, and enzymatic activity, which is often mediated through post-translational modification and the availability of input metabolites ( Temme et al., 2012 117. Temme, K. ∙ Zhao, D. ∙ Voigt, C.A. Refactoring the nitrogen fixation gene cluster from Klebsiella oxytoca Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :7085-7090 Crossref Scopus (268) PubMed Google Scholar ). Through evolutionary divergence, the regulation of these layers is expectedly strain- and environment-specific. To decouple biosynthetic capacity from strain-specific regulatory layers, we developed a computer-aided design (CAD: cad-sge.com ) strategy to redesign BGCs at the level of an individual coding sequence (CDS), transcription, and translation, establishing synthetic design principles to enable versatile cross-kingdom host-range expression ( Figure 2 A).
We assess and implement redesign principles at the individual CDS level ( Figure 2 B). Commonly used codon optimization approaches (e.g., codon adaptation index [CAI] and tRNA adaptation index [TAI]; Mauro and Chappell, 2014 79. Mauro, V.P. ∙ Chappell, S.A. A critical analysis of codon optimization in human therapeutics Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20 :604-613 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) are constrained because they are tailored for a target species, whereas our approach simultaneously designs constructs for diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa, each with greatly varying GC content, tRNA abundances, and codon usage. Additionally, the general utility of codon optimization for heterologous expression remains an unresolved subject, where large-scale screens fail to capture a general correlation between codon adaptation and expression levels ( Kudla et al., 2009 60. Kudla, G. ∙ Murray, A.W. ∙ Tollervey, D. ... Coding-sequence determinants of gene expression in Escherichia coli Science. 2009; 324 :255-258 Crossref Scopus (1002) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To address these constraints and enable the versatile expression of SGEs, we developed an alternative CDS-level optimization protocol to capture more host-independent optimization parameters, accounting for six factors ( Figure 2 B). First, individual CDSs are converted from amino acid to nucleotide sequence; here, the baseline codon usage distribution is based on the codon usage of highly expressed genes of a species of choice. For the experiments in this work, we utilized Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis base selections. The base codon distribution is depleted of canonically inhibiting codons ( Figure S1 A).
Second, codon usage at the N terminus has been shown to significantly impact gene expression, largely due to the 5′ RNA secondary structure ( Angov, 2011 4. Angov, E. Codon usage: nature’s roadmap to expression and folding of proteins Biotechnol. J. 2011; 6 :650-659 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). This feature is conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and serves as a useful parameter to promote the host-range versatility. We analyzed the predicted 5′ mRNA structure of E. coli genes before and after codon optimization in silico . Using Vienna RNA Suite ( Lorenz et al., 2011 75. Lorenz, R. ∙ Bernhart, S.H. ∙ Höner zu Siederdissen, C. ... ViennaRNA package 2.0 Algorithms Mol. Biol. 2011; 6 :26 Crossref Scopus (2441) PubMed Google Scholar ), we calculated the minimum folding energy across each CDS using a 30-bp sliding window. This data highlight the depletion of secondary structure in native gene sequences, particularly in the 36-bp region at the 5′-terminus, consistent with prior findings ( Figure 2 C; Goodman et al., 2013 45. Goodman, D.B. ∙ Church, G.M. ∙ Kosuri, S. Causes and effects of N-terminal codon bias in bacterial genes Science. 2013; 342 :475-479 Crossref Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ). This depletion of structure is reproducible across phyla ( Figure S1 B). If CDSs are recoded by the standard CAI approach ( Mauro and Chappell, 2014 79. Mauro, V.P. ∙ Chappell, S.A. A critical analysis of codon optimization in human therapeutics Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20 :604-613 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the codon distribution of highly expressed E. coli genes, this 5′-thermodynamic property dissipates ( Figure 2 C). Instead, our algorithm selects for synonymous sequences that result in low 5′ secondary structure.
We next investigated the impact of genetic design parameters on 108 recoded GFP variants. We found that the most significant impact on GFP expression came from codon usage at the 12 N-terminal amino acids ( Figures S1 C–S1E). Previous studies had noted an enrichment of less adapted codons among the first 30–50 codons ( Tuller et al., 2010 123. Tuller, T. ∙ Carmi, A. ∙ Vestsigian, K. ... An evolutionarily conserved mechanism for controlling the efficiency of protein translation Cell. 2010; 141 :344-354 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (571) PubMed Google Scholar ). Through subsequent FACS-seq experiments, it was found that secondary structure was the predominant determinant, while codon usage was a tolerable covariate ( Goodman et al., 2013 45. Goodman, D.B. ∙ Church, G.M. ∙ Kosuri, S. Causes and effects of N-terminal codon bias in bacterial genes Science. 2013; 342 :475-479 Crossref Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, we found that even when selecting for low (<3.5 kcal/mol) 5′-mRNA secondary structure, the codon usage remained impactful ( Figure S1 C), a finding distinct from the previous studies and worthy of further investigation. At the N terminus, using codons enriched in E. coli highly expressed genes resulted in higher fluorescence than that when using the codons enriched in the FACS-seq assay. Additionally, for the remainder of the open reading frame, we found no significant correlation between CAI and protein expression. This suggests that the aggregate codon adaptation was not strongly predictive of the expression strength. Indeed, GFP genes recoded to match E. coli ’s codon usage performed comparably in E. coli to those recoded to match B. subtilis codon usage, which were neutrally randomized or were enriched in inhibitory codons to create poor CAI values. This lack of correlation suggests that codon usage is not strictly a barrier for broad host-range expression.
Third, we designed synthetic 5′ UTR sequences incorporating hybrid eukaryotic and prokaryotic elements that are known to impact gene expression in various microbial taxa ( Figure 2 D). Our implementation builds off the ribosome binding site (RBS) calculator, a previously described thermodynamic translation initiation model ( Salis et al., 2009 102. Salis, H.M. ∙ Mirsky, E.A. ∙ Voigt, C.A. Automated design of synthetic ribosome binding sites to control protein expression Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27 :946-950 Crossref Scopus (1220) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was expanded to include a stricter Shine-Dalgarno sequence requirement and start codon spacing preference ( Vellanoweth and Rabinowitz, 1992 126. Vellanoweth, R.L. ∙ Rabinowitz, J.C. The influence of ribosome-binding-site elements on translational efficiency in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli in vivo Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6 :1105-1114 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, the sequence is enriched in poly AU nucleotides, which mirrors UTRs in both bacterial phyla and eukaryotes ( Cuperus et al., 2017 28. Cuperus, J.T. ∙ Groves, B. ∙ Kuchina, A. ... Deep learning of the regulatory grammar of yeast 5′ untranslated regions from 500,000 random sequences Genome Res. 2017; 27 :2015-2024 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), and concludes with a S. cerevisiae consensus Kozak sequence ( Hamilton et al., 1987 47. Hamilton, R. ∙ Watanabe, C.K. ∙ de Boer, H.A. Compilation and comparison of the sequence context around the AUG startcodons in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNAs Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15 :3581-3593 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). Integrating all these design considerations results in a base UTR defined as N 17 (A/U) 6 AGGAGN 4 AAA ( Figure 2 D). The variable “N” positions are then iteratively mutated until the desired predicted translation initiation rates (TIRs) are reached, tailored specifically for each CDS. In this study, thermodynamic parameters to calculate TIR were based on empirical data collected in E. coli ( Salis et al., 2009 102. Salis, H.M. ∙ Mirsky, E.A. ∙ Voigt, C.A. Automated design of synthetic ribosome binding sites to control protein expression Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27 :946-950 Crossref Scopus (1220) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, in more distant organisms, absolute TIR values may differ.
Next, E. coli genes were recoded 100 times each to quantify undesired transcription termination and translation initiation signals resulting from codon optimization. We found widespread emergence of the internal prokaryotic translation start sites, which were predicted using the RBS calculator parameters ( Salis et al., 2009 102. Salis, H.M. ∙ Mirsky, E.A. ∙ Voigt, C.A. Automated design of synthetic ribosome binding sites to control protein expression Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27 :946-950 Crossref Scopus (1220) PubMed Google Scholar ). An average of 3.8 internal RBSs appeared per gene-recoding attempt ( Figure 2 E). In native genes, aberrant internal translation initiation is largely disfavored, even in the presence of Shine-Dalgarno motifs upstream of ATG codons, as demonstrated by ribosomal profiling experiments ( Li et al., 2012 69. Li, G.-W. ∙ Oh, E. ∙ Weissman, J.S. The anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence drives translational pausing and codon choice in bacteria Nature. 2012; 484 :538-541 Crossref Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the mechanism and sequence features by which internal initiation is avoided are not understood ( Saito et al., 2020 101. Saito, K. ∙ Green, R. ∙ Buskirk, A.R. Translational initiation in E. coli occurs at the correct sites genome-wide in the absence of mRNA-rRNA base-pairing Elife. 2020; 9 :e55002 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, we found that rho-independent terminators spontaneously appear in 19% of the recoding attempts, as identified using the predictive tool transtermHP ( Kingsford et al., 2007 59. Kingsford, C.L. ∙ Ayanbule, K. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Rapid, accurate, computational discovery of Rho-independent transcription terminators illuminates their relationship to DNA uptake Genome Biol. 2007; 8 :R22 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 E). Accordingly, as the fifth design principle, we algorithmically depleted NTG codons in all three forward coding frames. When an NTG codon cannot be avoided, the upstream sequence is then synonymously modified to structurally inhibit internal ribosome entry. These efforts significantly decreased the number of predicted internal translation initiation sites from 3.8 to 0.6 per gene (p < 0.001 using a two-tailed paired Z-test) ( Figure 2 E). As the sixth design principle, our algorithm scans and removes the deleterious terminators, bringing the computed value to 0%.
We next designed a prokaryotic-eukaryotic regulatory element for cross-kingdom transcription initiation. In prokaryotes, multiple genes can be concurrently transcribed in an operon. However, each CDS generally utilizes a distinct promoter and terminator in eukaryotes. Given this requirement, the 5′ sequence of each CDS is further extended to include regulatory elements to initiate transcription in yeast. Our design creates intergenic regions depleted in nucleosome occupancy, which is strongly correlated with both efficient transcription initiation and poly-A termination in eukaryotes ( Ichikawa et al., 2016 48. Ichikawa, Y. ∙ Morohashi, N. ∙ Tomita, N. ... Sequence-directed nucleosome-depletion is sufficient to activate transcription from a yeast core promoter in vivo Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 476 :57-62 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morse et al., 2017 82. Morse, N.J. ∙ Gopal, M.R. ∙ Wagner, J.M. ... Yeast terminator function can be modulated and designed on the basis of predictions of nucleosome occupancy ACS Synth. Biol. 2017; 6 :2086-2095 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 D). For this study, we used a previously described library of synthetic S. cerevisiae terminators ( Curran et al., 2015 29. Curran, K.A. ∙ Morse, N.J. ∙ Markham, K.A. ... Short synthetic terminators for improved heterologous gene expression in yeast ACS Synth. Biol. 2015; 4 :824-832 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ; MacPherson and Saka, 2017 76.

Yeast synthetic terminators: fine regulation of strength through linker sequences Chembiochem. 2019; 20 :2383-2389 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To develop 5′ sequences designed to initiate eukaryotic transcription, we constructed an expanded library of synthetic yeast promoters that addressed four key requirements of cross-kingdom SGE design ( Figures 3 A and 3B). First, these eukaryotic elements should not interfere with bacterial expression. Second, sequence length was minimized to reduce synthesis costs and minimize the negative impact of untranslated sequences on bacterial mRNA stability ( Cetnar and Salis, 2021 20. Cetnar, D.P. ∙ Salis, H.M. Systematic quantification of sequence and structural determinants controlling mRNA stability in bacterial operons ACS Synth. Biol. 2021; 10 :318-332 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, we minimized the sequence homology to prevent deletions through homologous recombination. Fourth, promoters were screened for predicted terminators and RBSs. We adopted a previously reported framework to achieve robust eukaryotic expression by arraying synthetic 10-bp upstream activity sequences (UASs) (6 distinct sequences), 30-bp core sequences (9 distinct sequences), a consensus TATA box (TATAAAG), and random 30-bp spacers ( Figure 3 C; Data S1 ) ( Redden and Alper, 2015 96. Redden, H. ∙ Alper, H.S. The development and characterization of synthetic minimal yeast promoters Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7810 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also mined 48 transcription start sites (TSSs, see Data S1 ) matching the consensus motif [A(A rich ) 5 NPy A (A/T)NN(A rich ) 6 ] from the native S. cerevisiae genome ( Zhang and Dietrich, 2005 139. Zhang, Z. ∙ Dietrich, F.S. Mapping of transcription start sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using 5′ SAGE Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :2838-2851 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We tested the impact of UAS number and the depletion of nucleosome occupancy at the TATA box and TSS, which is characteristic of strong promoters ( Ichikawa et al., 2016 48. Ichikawa, Y. ∙ Morohashi, N. ∙ Tomita, N. ... Sequence-directed nucleosome-depletion is sufficient to activate transcription from a yeast core promoter in vivo Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 476 :57-62 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 A). For the latter, the primary sequence of the spacers was interspaced with poly-A or poly-T 5-mers, guided by the NuPop hidden Markov model for predicting nucleosome position ( Xi et al., 2010 136. Xi, L. ∙ Fondufe-Mittendorf, Y. ∙ Xia, L. ... Predicting nucleosome positioning using a duration hidden Markov model BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11 :346 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 B). Using a yeast-optimized GFP (mUkGFP) ( Kaishima et al., 2016 55. Kaishima, M. ∙ Ishii, J. ∙ Matsuno, T. ... Expression of varied GFPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae : codon optimization yields stronger than expected expression and fluorescence intensity Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :35932 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), we measured the impact of these variables on gene expression. Increasing the number (3–5) of UASs increased the expression levels 2.4-fold (3 UASs, p < 0.001) and 21-fold (5 UASs, p < 0.0001). With 5 UASs, the expression was comparable to the strong tef1 promoter of S. cerevisiae . Additionally, the depletion of nucleosome occupancy increased the expression levels 8.2-fold (p < 0.01) ( Figure 3 D).
We expanded the library to construct and characterize 48 synthetic hybrid promoters ( Data S1 ). To functionally test this library, promoter-GFP cassettes were cloned on an E. coli/S. cerevisiae shuttle vector, pYP ( Figures 3 B and S6 A). Synthetic promoters spanned a 22-fold range of activity levels, with many meeting or exceeding the strength of the native tef1 and adh1 promoters ( Figure 3 E). As predicted, nucleosome depletion broadly generated promoters with higher activity (p < 0.001). At the library level, promoters with 5 UASs did not necessarily exhibit higher expression than those with 3 or 4 UASs ( Figure S3 E). Instead, we found that, for any given promoter, UASs can be reliably used to tune expression upward. To demonstrate the impact of UAS quantity on expression levels, we increased the number of UASs from 3 to 5 in three weak promoters (YP2, YP7, and YP8). In two of the three promoters tested, this resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in expression (p < 0.0001) ( Figure S3 F), providing a basis for rational pathway engineering through promoter tuning. GFP fluorescence in S. cerevisiae strongly correlated with RNA levels (r 2 = 0.92), confirming that differences in promoter strength were determined at the transcriptional level ( Figure 3 G).
When these constructs were shuttled into E. coli BL21(DE3), we hypothesized that the fluorescence level would be steady since the bacterial transcription/translation signals were held constant. A small subset of promoters exhibited attenuated expression ( Figure 3 F). The degree of attenuation in E. coli was not meaningfully correlated with the expression strength in S. cerevisiae ( Figure 3 I). Using qRT-PCR, we found that only some of the variability could be explained at the mRNA level, as RNA levels differed by less than 3-fold, suggesting the presence of contributing effects at the translational level ( Figure S3 C). We next swapped the mUkGFP reporter with an eGFP reporter to study the impact of distinct gene sequences. These two genes share no significant nucleotide sequence similarity, as evaluated with BLAST alignment. Promoters were correlated in strength across the two reporters (r 2 = 0.42) ( Figures 3 H and S3 D), indicating that expression level trends were largely independent of the downstream gene sequence. Taken together, this library of synthetic promoters can be appended to the 5′ sequence of our redesigned CDSs to activate BGCs in both E. coli and S. cerevisiae .
To drive bacterial transcription, we selected the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) and cognate T7 promoter (pT7) system, given its orthogonality, processivity, and host-independence ( Tabor, 2001 116. Tabor, S. Expression using the T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2001; 11 :16.2.1-16.2.11 Google Scholar ). Because transcription from pT7 is constrained by the cognate T7RNAP, the major challenge was in expressing the T7RNAP in a host versatile manner. Our approach also sought to achieve titratable expression since T7RNAP-overexpressed genes can accumulate up to 30% of the total cellular protein and sequester 50% of the translation capacity ( Segall-Shapiro et al., 2014 106. Segall-Shapiro, T.H. ∙ Meyer, A.J. ∙ Ellington, A.D. ... A ‘resource allocator’ for transcription based on a highly fragmented T7 RNA polymerase Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10 :742 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ), resulting in fitness defects and suboptimal biosynthetic pathway functionality ( Scott et al., 2010 105. Scott, M. ∙ Gunderson, C.W. ∙ Mateescu, E.M. ... Interdependence of cell growth and gene expression: origins and consequences Science. 2010; 330 :1099-1102 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). To provide a balance between robustness and titratability, we expanded upon the UBER system, which couples positive and negative feedback loops to modulate gene expression ( Kushwaha and Salis, 2015 62. Kushwaha, M. ∙ Salis, H.M. A portable expression resource for engineering cross-species genetic circuits and pathways Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7832 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In the original UBER framework, T7RNAP production is seeded by upstream basal transcription and further auto-regulated through a positive feedback loop catalyzed by an upstream pT7. To prevent compounding RNAP amplification, a negative feedback loop proportionally produces a TetR repressor to inhibit T7RNAP production. However, this original design was not demonstrated to have inducible activity, a critical criterion for the controlled expression of heterologous biosynthetic pathways that may variably exhibit cytotoxicity in diverse hosts.
Previous work found that the TIR of the T7RNAP was the primary determinant controlling system output ( Kushwaha and Salis, 2015 62. Kushwaha, M. ∙ Salis, H.M. A portable expression resource for engineering cross-species genetic circuits and pathways Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7832 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that a theophylline-responsive translational riboswitch, which was previously engineered to have a broad host range, could impart tunable control generalizable to function across bacterial phyla ( Espah Borujeni et al., 2016 39. Espah Borujeni, A. ∙ Mishler, D.M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Automated physics-based design of synthetic riboswitches from diverse RNA aptamers Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :1-13 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Topp et al., 2010 121. Topp, S. ∙ Reynoso, C.M.K. ∙ Seeliger, J.C. ... Synthetic riboswitches that induce gene expression in diverse bacterial species Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76 :7881-7884 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wachsmuth et al., 2013 128. Wachsmuth, M. ∙ Findeiß, S. ∙ Weissheimer, N. ... De novo design of a synthetic riboswitch that regulates transcription termination Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :2541-2551 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lipophilic inducer, theophylline, is permeable across lipid membranes ( Bennion et al., 2017 9. Bennion, B.J. ∙ Be, N.A. ∙ McNerney, M.W. ... Predicting a Drug’s membrane permeability: a computational model validated with in vitro permeability assay data J. Phys. Chem. B. 2017; 121 :5228-5237 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is not reported to have antibacterial activity ( Borkowski et al., 2016 15. Borkowski, A. ∙ Ławniczak, Ł. ∙ Cłapa, T. ... Different antibacterial activity of novel theophylline-based ionic liquids—growth kinetic and cytotoxicity studies Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 2016; 130 :54-64 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus being suitable for this application. We constructed 16 variants of this circuit that alter the strength of positive-negative feedback, riboswitch variant, and general architecture ( Figures 3 J and 3K; Data S2 ). These variants were initially tested in E. coli Mach1 cells on a low-copy miniRK2 vector pT7RNAP ( Figure S4 B). The output is measured with a GFP reporter on a second plasmid, pT7 GFP ( Figure S4 C). Although T7RNAP transcribed by seeding transcription alone (variant T0) was active, the signal became highly attenuated when we tested two theophylline riboswitch variants (T1 and T2) ( Figure 3 L). This attenuation was rescued by adding positive feedback (T3); however, this came at the cost of high uninduced background expression. Adding negative feedback (T4 and T5) substantially reduced the background without compromising the induced expression level. Positive feedback strength was adjusted by comparing the wildtype pT7 WT with an attenuated mutant pT7 H9 ( Jones et al., 2015 54. Jones, J.A. ∙ Vernacchio, V.R. ∙ Lachance, D.M. ... ePathOptimize: a combinatorial approach for transcriptional balancing of metabolic pathways Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :11301 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 M); this did not significantly affect the reporter activity. Additionally, tetR and T7RNAP genes were codon optimized, also without any significant impact on expression levels (T12 and T13). A significant increase in dynamic range was observed when the T7RNAP and tetR genes were split from a bicistronic operon to a two-gene architecture (T15). This change removed the tetR gene from direct negative feedback, likely explaining the stronger background repression in the uninduced state. To benchmark this circuit, we transformed the pT7-eGFP plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3), where T7RNAP is produced by an isopropyl β- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-induced placUV5 promoter. Compared with BL21(DE3), variant T15 maintained equally induced expression (non-significant difference), with 66-fold lower uninduced background than BL21(DE3) (p < 0.0001). We demonstrated that variant T15 functions as an AND gate, requiring both theophylline and anhydrotetracycline (aTc) for full induction ( Figure 3 N). We found that higher levels of induction impair growth ( Figure 3 O), highlighting the importance of titratable expression.
To assess whether this T7RNAP gene circuit can function in both Gram-negative and -positive strains, we placed variant T15 and the eGFP reporter onto an ultra-broad host-range shuttle vector, consisting of the RSF1010 ( mobA Y25F) ( Bishé et al., 2019 11. Bishé, B. ∙ Taton, A. ∙ Golden, J.W. Modification of RSF1010-based broad-host-range plasmids for improved conjugation and cyanobacterial bioprospecting iScience. 2019; 20 :216-228 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pAMβ1 ( Bruand et al., 1993 17. Bruand, C. ∙ Le Chatelier, E. ∙ Ehrlich, S.D. ... A fourth class of theta-replicating plasmids: the pAM beta 1 family from gram-positive bacteria Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90 :11668-11672 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) origins of replication, pBroad ( Figure S4 D). Using this vector, we demonstrated titratable T7RNAP function in both E. coli and B. subtilis ( Figure 3 P).
To complement the plasmid-based mobilization approach, we sought to develop a chromosomal integration strategy for the stable transfer of SGEs across diverse hosts, given that previous studies have demonstrated that integration can increase genetic stability and biosynthetic pathway productivity ( Tyo et al., 2009 124. Tyo, K.E.J. ∙ Ajikumar, P.K. ∙ Stephanopoulos, G. Stabilized gene duplication enables long-term selection-free heterologous pathway expression Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27 :760-765 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, transconjugation is used to empirically identify safe landing sites that can stably express the T7RNAP circuit ( Figure 4 A). Second, site-specific integration is used to introduce SGEs into those safe landing sites ( Figure 4 B).
To identify “safe” landing sites throughout the genome, we constructed a cassette consisting of the T7RNAP circuit variant T15, a pT7-GFP-nanoluc luciferase fusion reporter, an antibiotic selectable marker, and asymmetric phiC31 attP sites for pathway integration ( Colloms et al., 2014 24. Colloms, S.D. ∙ Merrick, C.A. ∙ Olorunniji, F.J. ... Rapid metabolic pathway assembly and modification using serine integrase site-specific recombination Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :e23 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 A). This cassette was flanked by transposase terminal repeats and mobilized on an R6K-based suicide plasmid (pLP, Figure S4 E) via incP-mediated conjugation ( Thomas and Smith, 1987 118. Thomas, C.M. ∙ Smith, C.A. Incompatibility Group P plasmids: genetics, evolution, and use in genetic manipulation Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41 :77-101 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To achieve a broad host-range integration, we tested hyperactive variants of both the mariner family Himar ( Lampe et al., 1999 63. Lampe, D.J. ∙ Akerley, B.J. ∙ Rubin, E.J. ... Hyperactive transposase mutants of the Himar1 mariner transposon Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :11428-11433 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Tn5 transposases ( Martínez-García et al., 2011 77. Martínez-García, E. ∙ Calles, B. ∙ Arévalo-Rodríguez, M. ... pBAM1: an all-synthetic genetic tool for analysis and construction of complex bacterial phenotypes BMC Microbiol. 2011; 11 :38 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ), both of which are host factor-independent and show little bias in integration loci. Initially, these transposases were driven by a pTac promoter, which is highly active due to its consensus −10 and −35 promoter elements ( de Boer et al., 1983 31. de Boer, H.A. ∙ Comstock, L.J. ∙ Vasser, M. The tac promoter: a functional hybrid derived from the trp and lac promoters Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1983; 80 :21-25 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We anticipated that strong pTac activity could counterbalance the exponentially decreasing efficiency associated with transposing large genetic constructs ( Figure 4 A; Lampe et al., 1998 64. Lampe, D.J. ∙ Grant, T.E. ∙ Robertson, H.M. Factors affecting transposition of the Himar1 mariner transposon in vitro Genetics. 1998; 149 :179-187 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) while remaining repressed in a LacR + E. coli conjugation donor strain. However, attempts to clone this construct consistently resulted in mutations presumably due to elevated basal expression from the pTac promoter ( Figure S4 ). Natively, transposases are negatively regulated, and synthetic overexpression is toxic ( Weinreich et al., 1994 134. Weinreich, M.D. ∙ Yigit, H. ∙ Reznikoff, W.S. Overexpression of the Tn5 transposase in Escherichia coli results in filamentation, aberrant nucleoid segregation, and cell death: analysis of E. coli and transposase suppressor mutations J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176 :5494-5504 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This issue is often resolved by using recipient-specific promoters ( Dempwolff et al., 2020 33. Dempwolff, F. ∙ Sanchez, S. ∙ Kearns, D.B. TnFLX: a third-generation mariner-based transposon system for Bacillus subtilis Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2020; 86 e02893–e02819 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, to maintain a broad host range, we empirically developed two solutions. First, we constructed a trans-inhibiting plasmid, pInh ( Figure S4 F) that expressed a dominant-negative Tn5 inhibitor gene ( de la Cruz et al., 1993 32. de la Cruz, N.B. ∙ Weinreich, M.D. ∙ Wiegand, T.W. ... Characterization of the Tn5 transposase and inhibitor proteins: a model for the inhibition of transposition J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175 :6932-6938 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), an SP6 RNAP that produced an anti-sense silencing transcript of the transposase gene and overexpressed lacI . The presence of this plasmid in the conjugal donor strain allowed us to successfully clone and maintain landing pad constructs without mutation. In parallel, we replaced pTac with the bacteriophage ʎ pR promoter, repressed by a temperature-sensitive cI857 gene ( Valdez-Cruz et al., 2010 125. Valdez-Cruz, N.A. ∙ Caspeta, L. ∙ Pérez, N.O. ... Production of recombinant proteins in E. coli by the heat inducible expression system based on the phage lambda pL and/or pR promoters Microb. Cell Fact. 2010; 9 :18 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). This promoter exhibited better repression in E. coli . Recoding the cI857 gene and appending a strong synthetic RBS with our CAD further reduced background by 25-fold (p < 0.001) ( Figure S5 ). Together, these strategies successfully inhibited transposase activity in the conjugal donor while allowing uninhibited transient expression in recipient microbes.
We tested an apramycin selectable landing pad, where seed transcription for the T7RNAP circuit was provided either by the active, broad host-range promoter P1 from pIP1433 ( Trieu-Cuot et al., 1985 122. Trieu-Cuot, P. ∙ Gerbaud, G. ∙ Lambert, T. ... In vivo transfer of genetic information between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria EMBO J. 1985; 4 :3583-3587 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S5 ) or by relying on background transcription at the host integration locus. Upon mobilizing this landing pad into E. coli MG1655 (transconjugation frequency = 1.5 × 10 −5 ), we used flow cytometry to evaluate the transposed population ± T7RNAP circuit induction (n ∼ 2,000 clones). The resulting population had broad fluorescence distributions evidenced by an elevated coefficient of variation (CV) ( Figure 4 C), suggesting that there were context effects caused by the integration locus. We evaluated four individual clones by flow cytometry and observed heterogeneity at several levels, including lower uninduced background fluorescence (Clone 1) and higher induction strength (Clone 3). This approach allows us to leverage genetic context as a variable for tuning heterologous expression by selecting clones possessing the desired profile. By surveying multiple genetic loci, we identified a “privileged” clone (Clone 3), which upon theophylline induction, showed 20-fold stronger GFP expression than the population average. This variability emerged in landing pads that both contained and lacked the pIP1433 seeding promoter ( Figure 4 D), indicating that the presence of a strong promoter at the 5′ edge of the landing pad did not preclude heterogeneity caused by the integration locus.
To determine whether this strategy works in diverse microbes, we tested our conjugation-transposition system on a selected number of Gammaproteobacterial clades— Klebsiella aerogenes , Salmonella enterica , Pseudomonas putida , and Pseudomonas veronii , which exhibited transconjugation frequencies of 1.6 × 10 −5 , 9.2 × 10 −8 , 4.4 × 10 −7 , and 2.1 × 10 −7 , respectively. Upon transposition, we selected seven random clones to assay for inducible GFP production. We consistently found that within each strain, individual clones differ in the levels of GFP expression in response to theophylline induction ( Figure 4 D). These data demonstrate locus-specific variability of gene expression and the ability to screen loci to control expression levels across strains.
To introduce pathways into the landing pad, SGEs were cloned into an R6K-based suicide vector, pPath ( Figure S4 G), containing the phiC31 integrase and an aminoglycoside resistance gene functional in prokaryotes (kanamycin) and S. cerevisiae (G418). Pathways were flanked by asymmetrical attB sites, allowing integrase-mediated site-specific integration of the SGE cargo into the landing pad, displacing the GFP-luciferase reporter ( Figure 4 B). To test functionality, we introduced an SGE for the biosynthesis of the purple pigment violacein, natively produced by Chromobacterium violaceum ( Kumar, 2012 61. Kumar, M.R. Chromobacterium violaceum : a rare bacterium isolated from a wound over the scalp Int. J. Appl. Basic Med. Res. 2012; 2 :70-72 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 E). First, we quantified the consequences of redesigning this pathway into an SGE using our CAD-SGE algorithm. We compared the native wildtype pathway sequence with one where transcription is driven by pT7 and with a fully redesigned SGE. To guide the selection of yeast promoter strength in the SGE, we used previous metabolic engineering literature, which suggested that vioA and vioC should be expressed more strongly than the other three genes ( Jones et al., 2015 54. Jones, J.A. ∙ Vernacchio, V.R. ∙ Lachance, D.M. ... ePathOptimize: a combinatorial approach for transcriptional balancing of metabolic pathways Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :11301 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the heterologous host P. putida , we found that the wild-type sequence poorly produced pigment, compared with the pigment production by native C. violaceum ( Figure 4 F). Natively, transcription is regulated by a strain-specific quorum sensing mechanism ( McClean et al., 1997 80. McClean, K.H. ∙ Winson, M.K. ∙ Fish, L. ... Quorum sensing and Chromobacterium violaceum : exploitation of violacein production and inhibition for the detection of N-acylhomoserine lactones Microbiology (Reading). 1997; 143 :3703-3711 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, augmenting transcription with an orthogonal pT7 rescued metabolite production in a theophylline-dependent manner ( Figure 4 F). Full redesign into an SGE further rescued the production. Pigment production with the SGE, which was induced with 1 mM theophylline + 100 ng/mL aTc, was 8-fold over the wild-type pathway in P. putida (p < 0.001) and 2-fold over that of C. violaceum (p < 0.05). Production of the pigment could be titrated through the addition of theophylline ( Figure 4 F). This SGE was transferred to other landing pad-domesticated microbes, where we observed strong pigment production in a theophylline-inducible manner ( Figure 4 G). Pigment production was highest at 10 mM theophylline in P. putida , while peaking at 1 mM in K. aerogenes and S. enterica . By measuring the final OD 660 of induced strains, we found that the latter strains are less fit at high induction concentrations. Collectively, this highlights the importance of titratable induction as a method to mitigate toxicity and strain-to-strain variations in optimal expression levels ( Figure 4 G).
To functionally apply this system for natural product discovery, we targeted an uncharacterized BGC that had previously been computationally predicted ( Donia et al., 2014 36. Donia, M.S. ∙ Cimermancic, P. ∙ Schulze, C.J. ... A systematic analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters in the human microbiome reveals a common family of antibiotics Cell. 2014; 158 :1402-1414 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ) from the genome of Lactobacillus iners LEAF 2052A-d, which was isolated from the vagina of a bacterial vaginosis patient (cataloged as “BGC08”). The predicted gene cluster, which we refer to as the tyrocitabine ( tyb ) pathway, was initially annotated to contain a nonribosomal peptide synthetase ( tybD ), a regulatory gene, a major facilitator family drug transporter ( tybA ), and several genes of unknown function. BLAST and InterPro searches allowed us to additionally predict tRNA synthetase ( tybB ), ribosyltransferase ( tybC ), and (de)hydrogenase ( tybE ) functions for the unknown genes. Domain analysis of the predicted nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) indicated a single adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl- or acyl-carrier protein thiolation domain (T), an incomplete condensation (C) domain, and a fourth domain of unknown function. Analysis of the tRNA synthetase suggested homology to Class Ic TyrRS; however, it lacked the C-terminal RNA binding domain of canonical tRNA synthetases ( Pang et al., 2014 92. Pang, Y.L.J. ∙ Poruri, K. ∙ Martinis, S.A. tRNA synthetase: tRNA aminoacylation and beyond Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2014; 5 :461-480 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). We chose to characterize this pathway because of the human disease pathology of the source strain, the presence of a transporter gene that suggests the product is secreted, and the unexpected participation of a tRNA synthetase. In our cloning, we included a closely situated downstream gene of unknown function, as well as the native phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) gene located elsewhere in the genome, which would facilitate NRPS post-translational activation. The upstream transcriptional regulator gene was omitted for SGE design ( Figure 5 A). As done for the violacein pathway, we compared the native wild-type pathway sequence with the one with orthogonal pT7 transcription and with a fully redesigned SGE ( Figure 5 A). To compare experiments conducted with the violacein pathway, the orphan constructs were first mobilized into the landing pad-domesticated P. putida host for initial metabolite analysis.
Through pathway-targeted metabolite analysis, based on high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS), we initially focused on two of the most highly abundant pathway-dependent ions ( m/z 314.1195 and m/z 627.1771). Introducing the wildtype pathway sequence into P. putida led to only trace amounts of the m/z 314 metabolite, and we were unable to detect quantifiable amounts of the m/z 627 metabolite ( Figure 5 B). Complementation with pT7 transcription was unable to rescue metabolite production, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. The wild-type sequence contains a low GC content of 27.7%, suggesting possible maladaptive codon usage. Importantly, the fully redesigned SGE, which accounts for multiple layers of regulation, successfully rescued metabolite production in P. putida ( Figure 5 B).
To further interrogate the biosynthesis of this pathway, we used E. coli BL21(DE3) to perform detailed reverse genetic analysis and scale up production of intermediates and products for isolation and characterization. Twelve pathway-dependent entities (i.e., (M+H) m/z 394.0858 phospho-tyrolose [ 1 ], 314.1195 tyrolose [ 2 ], 316.1352 tyrolitol [ 3 ], 627.1771 tyrocitabine-626 [ 4 )], 669.1877 acyl-tyrocitabine-668 [ 5ab ], 697.2190 acyl-tyrocitabine-696 [ 6ab ], 725.2503 acyl-tyrocitabine-724 [ 7ab ], and 753.2816 acyl-tyrocitabine-752 [ 8ab ]) were characterized ( Data S3 ). UV and multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses and comparison with a synthetic standard revealed the structure of 2 to be a ribosylated tyrosine that had undergone an Amadori rearrangement. 3 was a reduced form of 2 and was similarly confirmed using a synthetic standard (reductive amination of L-Tyr and D-arabinose). MS/MS fragmentation analysis and molecular formula assignment of 4 suggested that this compound could be generated via an adenylation-rearrangement sequence of the tyrolitol-type substrate(s) ( Figure 5 C). NMR experiments on tyrocitabine remarkably established the presence of AMP and an orthoester-phosphate-type motif as two key structural building blocks. The connectivity of these two moieties was established via a 1D 31 P NMR decoupling experiment. The 3D structure of the intriguing ring system in 4 constructed by the orthoester-phosphate moiety was confirmed by the comparison of experimental interproton distances calibrated from ROESY with those from a computational simulation of plausible diastereomers. The remaining pathway-dependent entities ( 5a/b, 6a/b, 7a/b, 8a/b ) were structurally related to 4 with varying acyl modifications, including acetylation, butyrylation, hexanoylation, and octanoylation, respectively. ROESY and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) NMR analyses confirmed that these acyl chains were substituted at the 3′ position (major, a series) of the AMP ribosyl moiety with some observed spontaneous intramolecular transesterification to the 2′ position (minor, b series).
Single-gene deletions of the multigene pathway in E. coli ( Figure 5 C) supported an order of operations in tyrocitabine assembly ( Figure 5 D). These studies support a step-wise biosynthesis in which the anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase-family ribosyltransferase ( tybC ) is required for the ribosylation of L-Tyr and the subsequent Amadori rearrangement leading to phospho-tyrolose ( 1 ) and tyrolose ( 2 ). This mechanism is reminiscent of intermediate steps in bacterial tryptophan and histidine biosynthesis ( Barona-Gómez and Hodgson, 2003 8. Barona-Gómez, F. ∙ Hodgson, D.A. Occurrence of a putative ancient-like isomerase involved in histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis EMBO Rep. 2003; 4 :296-300 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the (de)hydrogenase ( tybE ) contributes to tyrolitol ( 3 ) formation, suggesting that TybE hydrogenates the tyrolose precursor(s). The tRNA synthetase ( tybB ) is required for a remarkable “abortive” tRNA synthetase reaction, leading to tyrocitabine, the free adenylated product 4 featuring an orthoester linkage at the phosphate moiety, suggesting an evolutionary selection for the loss of traditional tRNA synthetase functionality in favor of specialized metabolite biosynthesis. Orthoesters appear in a variety of natural products, but their biosyntheses remain largely unknown ( Li et al., 2018 70. Li, S. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Direct genetic and enzymatic evidence for oxidative cyclization in hygromycin B biosynthesis ACS Chem. Biol. 2018; 13 :2203-2210 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matsuda et al., 2018 78. Matsuda, Y. ∙ Bai, T. ∙ Phippen, C.B.W. ... Novofumigatonin biosynthesis involves a non-heme iron-dependent endoperoxide isomerase for orthoester formation Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2587 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Acylation of 4 to access major 5a – 8a required the tybD NRPS gene, suggesting that the NRPS plays an acyl-ligase role in bridging fatty acid and nucleotide biosynthesis.
To confirm the biosynthetic route, we conducted in vitro protein biochemical studies using individually purified enzymes and substrate feeding studies in E. coli expressing the tyb pathway ( tyb + ). We first established that isolated TybC uses L-Tyr and PRPP as a ribosyl donor to produce the Amadori rearrangement products 1 and 2 ( Figure 6 A). Next, we demonstrated that TybE catalyzes a stereoselective hydrogenation of both 1 and 2 into phospho- 3 and 3 , respectively ( Figure 6 B). However, phospho- 3 was not detected in cell extracts from tyb + E. coli , suggesting early phosphate hydrolysis in cells. L-Tyr supplementation in tyb + E. coli enhanced the production of 2 ( Figure S6 A), consistent with TybC’s proposed Amadori synthase role. Moreover, supplementation with synthetic 2 enhanced the production of 4 in tyb + E. coli and was capable of “chemically complementing” a knockout of the ribosyltransferase tybC . These studies strongly support the intermediacy of 2 ( Figures S5 B and S5C). We further demonstrated that isolated TybB could directly transform the polyol-amino acid 3 into the orthoester-phosphate 4 in an ATP-dependent manner ( Figure 6 C), confirming the “abortive” tRNA synthetase role of this tRNA synthetase family. Finally, feeding free fatty acids, such as octanoic acid, to tyb + E. coli significantly enhanced the production of the ultimate NRPS-dependent acyl-tyrocitabines ( Figure S6 D).
To establish a biological activity for the tryocitabine family, we used the similarity ensemble approach (SEA) ( Keiser et al., 2007 57. Keiser, M.J. ∙ Roth, B.L. ∙ Armbruster, B.N. ... Relating protein pharmacology by ligand chemistry Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25 :197-206 Crossref Scopus (1349) PubMed Google Scholar ) to computationally predict candidate targets, and various components of protein translation were among the hits ( Data S4 ). Using PURExpress protein synthesis technologies ( Shimizu et al., 2001 110. Shimizu, Y. ∙ Inoue, A. ∙ Tomari, Y. ... Cell-free translation reconstituted with purified components Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19 :751-755 Crossref Scopus (1292) PubMed Google Scholar ) to probe the molecular mechanism, we established that 4 inhibited the translation of a GFP reporter with a half-maximal inhibition (IC 50 ) of 13 μM, which was comparable to an erythromycin control (IC 50 2 μM) ( Figure 6 D). This inhibition occurred with either DNA or RNA substrates, suggesting that inhibition in the in vitro system was largely occurring at the post-transcriptional level ( Figures S7 A and S7B). Interestingly, the activity was abrogated when tyrocitabine was acylated, suggesting a possible prodrug mechanism where the acylated molecules would require hydrolytic activation by esterases in the recipient organism(s) ( Figure S7 C).
To test the host range, we mobilized the SGE into various bacteria ( E. coli MG1655, K. aerogenes , P. putida , B. subtilis , and S. enterica ) and S. cerevisiae . We found that our SGE can successfully produce the bioactive tyrocitabine ( 4 ) in all strains. The relative abundances of the tyrocitabines and their intermediates varied, suggesting anticipated strain-specific differences in metabolic flux through the pathway ( Figure 7 A). We found the P. putida host to be particularly gifted at producing the largest molecule acyl-tyrocitabine-752 ( 8 ), as assessed by relative HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis. By contrast, tyrocitabine and its precursors, but not the acyl-tyrocitabines, were detected in B. subtilis or S. cerevisiae . This diversity of outcomes highlights the utility of our approach in enabling rapid dissemination of genetic material across numerous strains belonging to broad taxonomic groups. Attempts to detect and induce the production of the tyrocitabines in the native Lactobacillus iners LEAF 2052 A - d failed to detect pathway-dependent metabolites beyond tyrolose ( 2 ) under the conditions of our studies ( Figures S6 D and S6E), highlighting the importance of employing a robust strategy to elucidate this pathway in heterologous hosts.
To analyze the broader phylogenetic distribution of this class of molecules, we performed amino acid BLAST homology searches of TybB against microbial genome sequences hosted on JGI-IMG, finding ∼100 close hits (1 × 10 −5 E value cutoff), which were largely distributed across Firmicutes and Actinobacteria ( Figure 7 B; Data S5 ). 92 of these hits were clustered with at least one other biosynthetic enzyme. To identify homologs at a gene cluster level and provide secondary support, we performed a search using cBlaster, binning on clusters that contained at least two genes with at least 20% amino acid similarity to proteins encoded in the Lactobacillus iners tyb pathway ( Data S5 ) ( Gilchrist et al., 2021 43. Gilchrist, C.L.M. ∙ Booth, T.J. ∙ van Wersch, B. ... cblaster: a remote search tool for rapid identification and visualization of homologous gene clusters Bioinformatics Adv. 2021; 1 vbab016 Crossref Google Scholar ). Although the resulting hits largely overlapped, cBlaster identified additional hits among archaeal species, suggesting cross-domain transfer of this pathway. These hits, like TybB, resembled Class 1c tRNA synthetases but lacked an RNA binding domain, as predicted by InterPro ( Figure 7 C). We found hits annotated as both TrpRS and TyrRS, suggesting potential differences in amino acid substrate specificity. Interestingly, these annotated “tRNA synthetases” were encoded in highly diversified operon contexts. Among the various operons (24 illustrated in Figure 7 B), the common feature was the presence of the TybC-like ribosyltransferase, but co-localizing accessory genes ranged from predicted NRPSs to hydrolases, glycosyltransferases, (de)hydrogenases, methyltransferases, and radical SAM enzymes. Notably, several operons contained multiple Class Ic synthetase-like enzymes in tandem, both lacking RNA binding domains. Based on our proposed biosynthetic route of the tyrocitabines and observation of various accessory enzymes in the related uncharacterized pathways, these data suggest that the tyrocitabines represent the founding members of a much broader class of specialized nucleotide metabolites and motivate further investigation in future studies.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we developed foundational technologies that allow us to decouple specialized metabolite BGCs from native layers of regulation, redesigning them into SGEs with versatile cross-kingdom functionality and permitting their transfer into diverse species. Together, these advances enabled the redesign of biosynthetic pathways and their expression in diverse microbes for the discovery of a class of nucleotide metabolites from the human microbiome. This work complements and advances current heterologous expression approaches, unifying the utility of genetic refactoring ( Ajikumar et al., 2010 2. Ajikumar, P.K. ∙ Xiao, W.-H. ∙ Tyo, K.E.J. ... Isoprenoid pathway optimization for taxol precursor overproduction in Escherichia coli Science. 2010; 330 :70-74 Crossref Scopus (1237) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chan et al., 2005 21. Chan, L.Y. ∙ Kosuri, S. ∙ Endy, D. Refactoring bacteriophage T7 Mol. Syst. Biol. 2005; 1 2005.0018 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Smanski et al., 2014 114. Smanski, M.J. ∙ Bhatia, S. ∙ Zhao, D. ... Functional optimization of gene clusters by combinatorial design and assembly Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :1241-1249 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ) and screening diverse model hosts ( Craig et al., 2010 26. Craig, J.W. ∙ Chang, F.Y. ∙ Kim, J.H. ... Expanding small-molecule functional metagenomics through parallel screening of broad-host-range cosmid environmental DNA libraries in diverse proteobacteria Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76 :1633-1641 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019a 129. Wang, G. ∙ Zhao, Z. ∙ Ke, J. ... CRAGE enables rapid activation of biosynthetic gene clusters in undomesticated bacteria Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2498-2510 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the innovations, our orthogonal T7RNAP-based bacterial expression platform addresses several limitations of the commonly used synthetic and natural promoters ( Jain and Srivastava, 2013 52. Jain, A. ∙ Srivastava, P. Broad host range plasmids FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2013; 348 :87-96 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). The activity of canonical bacterial promoters can be unpredictably variable across different species; for instance, the commonly used Anderson promoter collection, although highly active in E. coli , are largely and unexpectedly silent in Bacillus species, despite some having consensus −35 and −10 boxes. Promoters validated to function across Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria ( Bryksin and Matsumura, 2010 18. Bryksin, A.V. ∙ Matsumura, I. Rational design of a plasmid origin that replicates efficiently in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria PLoS One. 2010; 5 :e13244 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) tend to be strong constitutive promoters with variable activity across strains. Other canonical titratable promoters, such as pTet and pLac, which, while widely used in E. coli , are largely inactive in Bacillus and require strain-specific sequence optimization ( Geissendörfer and Hillen, 1990 41. Geissendörfer, M. ∙ Hillen, W. Regulated expression of heterologous genes in Bacillus subtilis using the Tn10 encoded tet regulatory elements Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33 :657-663 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Redesigned SGEs are amenable to rapid metabolic flux optimizations using computational guided flux balance analysis methods ( Orth et al., 2010 88. Orth, J.D. ∙ Thiele, I. ∙ Palsson, B.Ø. What is flux balance analysis? Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :245-248 Crossref Scopus (2193) PubMed Google Scholar ) or multiplex genome editing technologies ( Anzalone et al., 2020 5. Anzalone, A.V. ∙ Koblan, L.W. ∙ Liu, D.R. Genome editing with CRISPR-Cas nucleases, base editors, transposases and prime editors Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :824-844 Crossref Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wannier et al., 2021 133. Wannier, T.M. ∙ Ciaccia, P.N. ∙ Ellington, A.D. ... Recombineering and MAGE Nat. Rev. Methods Primers. 2021; 1 :8 Crossref Google Scholar ). Predictable tuning of gene expression is achievable in diverse hosts by modulating 5′ UTRs or adding or removing 10-mer UTRs in the eukaryotic promoters. Importantly, strains domesticated with a landing pad can be used “off the shelf” for future heterologous expression of BGCs, other pathways, or other genetic elements of interest.
Our approach overcame two key challenges when applied for the discovery of the tyrocitabines. First, without redesigning into an SGE, we were unable to detect metabolites beyond the early intermediate 2 in P. putida , which would have prevented the complete elucidation and characterization of the L. iners BGC. Similarly, attempts to detect the tyrocitabines in the native Lactobacillus iners LEAF 2052a-D failed under the conditions of our studies ( Figures 5 D and 5E), highlighting the necessity for heterologous expression. Second, the ability to mobilize the deorphanized pathway across multiple hosts simultaneously allowed us to quickly identify productive heterologous hosts. For example, we observed that the activity of the largest enzyme (the NRPS TybD) in the pathway was a bottleneck in several strains, causing the pathway to stall at tryrocitabine ( 4 ). Ultimately, our findings highlight the utility of being able to survey many distant hosts simultaneously, an observation consistent with previous studies ( Wang et al., 2019a 129. Wang, G. ∙ Zhao, Z. ∙ Ke, J. ... CRAGE enables rapid activation of biosynthetic gene clusters in undomesticated bacteria Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2498-2510 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Additionally, we propose that the tyrocitabines represent the founding members of a much larger, yet previously elusive, class of specialized microbial nucleotide metabolites in the environment, including members of the human microbiome. Specifically, we found numerous instances of misannotated Class Ic tRNA synthetases lacking RNA binding domains and co-localizing with anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase-like enzymes in both bacteria and archaea. Accessory proteins diverge substantially in the BGCs. We also found pathways that contain two tandem, yet sequence distinct Class Ic tRNA synthetases, homologous to TrpRS and TyrRS, similarly lacking their RNA binding domains. This suggests the core tyrocitabine scaffold is potentially highly diversified in nature. This structural diversity could have profound implications on the cell type specificity, localization, and biological targets of the resulting functionalized molecules. Although conservation and colocalization of key enzymatic components invite the hypothesis that the core tyrocitabine scaffold may be present in homologous pathways, further work will be needed to screen this chemical diversity and assess the extent to which the scaffold is maintained.
Noncanonical tRNA synthetase activities are of increasing interest. For instance, human TrpRS (i.e., WARS) has been implicated in playing key roles in innate immunity and p53 and IFNγ signaling ( Jin, 2019 53. Jin, M. Unique roles of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase in immune control and its therapeutic implications Exp. Mol. Med. 2019; 51 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar ). Other instances have been noted in natural product biosynthesis ( Moutiez et al., 2017 83. Moutiez, M. ∙ Belin, P. ∙ Gondry, M. Aminoacyl-tRNA-utilizing enzymes in natural product biosynthesis Chem. Rev. 2017; 117 :5578-5618 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), including abortive tRNA synthetase reactions, which lead to stress-enhanced signaling molecules that modulate quorum sensing responses ( Kim et al., 2020 58. Kim, C.S. ∙ Gatsios, A. ∙ Cuesta, S. ... Characterization of autoinducer-3 structure and biosynthesis in E. coli ACS Cent. Sci. 2020; 6 :197-206 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, the dedicated abortive tRNA synthetase reactions discovered in this study add a distinct dimension to specialized nucleotide metabolism, prompting further structural and biological characterization. More broadly, this highlights a largely unexplored genome mining strategy—scrutinizing (misannotated) genes that are classically considered “central metabolism” and filtering for those with missing or added domains and unusual genome context. Such an approach could uncover the continual evolution and repurposing of otherwise ancestral genes for acquiring new functions and biochemistries, including the discovery of non-standard amino acids ( Arranz-Gibert et al., 2018 6. Arranz-Gibert, P. ∙ Vanderschuren, K. ∙ Isaacs, F.J. Next-generation genetic code expansion Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2018; 46 :203-211 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this work, we present a synthetic biology technology employed to elucidate orphan BGCs. Given that only ∼10 3 of ∼10 5 gene clusters currently predicted on DOE’s IMG database have empirical elucidation, our approach is particularly poised to be scaled toward the discovery of these uncharacterized BGCs. Beyond this application, we propose that the versatility of our redesign principles can hold broad utility in rapidly domesticating diverse microbes for multiple applications, such as maximizing titers of high-value molecules in heterologous hosts ( Cravens et al., 2019 27. Cravens, A. ∙ Payne, J. ∙ Smolke, C.D. Synthetic biology strategies for microbial biosynthesis of plant natural products Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2142 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paddon et al., 2013 90. Paddon, C.J. ∙ Westfall, P.J. ∙ Pitera, D.J. ... High-level semi-synthetic production of the potent antimalarial artemisinin Nature. 2013; 496 :528-532 Crossref Scopus (1347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that cross-kingdom co-cultures of microbes can be leveraged to overcome challenges in heterologously producing difficult molecules, highlighting the utility of disseminating genetic cargo across taxonomic domains ( Wu et al., 2021 135. Wu, S. ∙ Ma, X. ∙ Zhou, A. ... Establishment of Strigolactone-producing bacterium-yeast consortium Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 :eabh4048 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2015 140. Zhou, K. ∙ Qiao, K. ∙ Edgar, S. ... Distributing a metabolic pathway among a microbial consortium enhances production of natural products Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :377-383 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, we anticipate that the cross-species mobilization and expression of SGEs could enhance the engineering of living therapeutics ( Zhou et al., 2020 141. Zhou, Z. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Sheng, H. ... Engineering probiotics as living diagnostics and therapeutics for improving human health Microb. Cell Fact. 2020; 19 :56 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), which require the transfer of genetic cargo into diverse environmental microbiome strains ( Inda et al., 2019 49. Inda, M.E. ∙ Broset, E. ∙ Lu, T.K. ... Emerging frontiers in microbiome engineering Trends Immunol. 2019; 40 :952-973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Through the development of an enabling technology for the design, mobilization, and expression of genetic elements, we anticipate that our work could aid in the domestication of non-model organisms and communities for diverse applications in medicine, environmental sustainability, and biotechnology.
The scope of this study did not include a screen of the full host range of our technology but instead focused on its development, characterization, and application. In particular, several of our proof-of-concept studies were in model heterologous hosts, such as P. putida . Future efforts, including the dissemination and application of our approach, will expand the range of species tested to include a wider selection of undomesticated and environmental strains to broaden utility and further reductively study the impacts of our gene redesign principles on expression levels and host range. For instance, efforts to examine how robustly our hybrid promoters function in alternate eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts would be a worthy pursuit. Additionally, the promising bioactivity lead of the tyrocitabines prompts further study of their molecular mechanism in the vaginal microbiome.

E. coli EcNR1, which contains lambda red recombineering machinery integrated at the bioAB locus ( Wang et al., 2009 130. Wang, H.H. ∙ Isaacs, F.J. ∙ Carr, P.A. ... Programming cells by multiplex genome engineering and accelerated evolution Nature. 2009; 460 :894-898 Crossref Scopus (1121) PubMed Google Scholar ), was used to perform single gene knockouts within the BGC08 pathway. To support the plasmid backbone, we used recombineering to insert the R6K pir gene at a noncoding chromosomal locus (coordinate: 1,415,470). To avoid adding additional antibiotic resistance burden, we used the tolC dual selectable marker to perform all manipulations – this marker can be selected for with 0.005% SDS, and against with colicin E1 ( DeVito, 2008 35. DeVito, J.A. Recombineering with tolC as a selectable/counter-selectable marker: remodeling the rRNA operons of Escherichia coli Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :e4 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We deleted the native tolC locus and reintroduced this marker to replace the ORF of individual genes in BGC08. Generally, for gene insertions, cassettes were amplified by PCR (Kapa HiFi Polymerase) using primers that appended 50 bp homology arms to the target. Cells were grown in LB at 34 °C until OD 600 of 0.6, then heat shocked in a 42 °C shaking water bath for 15 minutes. Cells were immediately placed on ice and 1 mL aliquots were washed 2x with ice-cold ddH 2 O and resuspended in 50 uL ddH 2 O + 100 ng DNA template, before transferring to a 1 mm electrocuvette. Cells were pulsed at 1800 V, 25 uF, 200 Ω (Bio-rad GenePulser) and recovered in 3 mL LB for 3 hours before plating on selective medium. For deleting tolC , a similar procedure was used, but with the template being a 5′-phosphorothioated 90 mer oligonucleotide containing 45 bp homology arms to the deletion locus.
All plasmids (see also Data S2 ) created for this study were constructed via Gibson assembly (NEB). Native biosynthetic pathways for violacein and BGC08/tyrocitabine were PCR amplified from the gDNA of C. violeceum ATCC 12472 and L. iners LEAF2052A-d , respectively. Redesigned biosynthetic pathways were sourced as overlapping synthetic DNA fragments <3.2 kb in size. Both were cloned into the pPath integrating shuttle vector (linearized with the restriction enzyme SfiI) via Gibson assembly, and transformed into E. coli TransforMax™ EC100D™ pir+ cells (Lucigen) for maintenance. Selection was performed with 5% sucrose to select against the parental plasmid.
For E. coli , electroporation was used to transform plasmid constructs. Briefly, 1 mL mid-log cell culture was washed 2x in 10% ice-cold glycerol, concentrated to 50 uL, and loaded into a 1 mm electrocuvette and pulsed at 1800 V, 25 uF, 200 Ω (Bio-rad GenePulser). For B. subtilis , natural transformation was used. Briefly, a single colony was picked into 1 mL transformation medium (900 uL ddH 2 O, 100 uL 10x MMC, 3 mM MgSO 4 ). The culture was grown at 37 °C for 4 hours. To each 200 uL aliquot of culture, 100 ng DNA was added and grown further for 2 hours before plating on selective LB medium. 10x MMC stock solution consisted of (10.7 g K 2 HPO 4 , 5.2 g KH 2 PO 4 , 20 g glucose, 0.88 g sodium citrate, 2.2 g potassium glutamate, 1 ml 1000X ferric ammonium citrate (2.2% stock), and 1 g casein hydrolysate raised to 100 mL final volume with ddH 2 0). For S. cerevisiae , the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit (Zymo) was used. For other bacterial strains used in this study, landing pads and biosynthetic pathways were introduced via conjugation.
For conjugation, the donor strain used was E. coli BW19851 (Yale Coli Genetic Stock Center), which contains the incP RP4 conjugative machinery and chromosomally-integrated R6K pir replication gene. We further used lambda red recombineering via the pORTMAGE protocol ( Nyerges et al., 2016 87. Nyerges, Á. ∙ Csörgő, B. ∙ Nagy, I. ... A highly precise and portable genome engineering method allows comparison of mutational effects across bacterial species Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :2502-2507 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to knock out the asd gene with apramycin resistance, which produced a diaminopimelic acid (DAP) auxotroph for post-conjugation counterselection. This strain was also transformed in the pInh to minimize the expression of transposase and integrase activity. Interspecies conjugations were performed by mixing 1 mL late log donor and recipient strains, washing away selective antibiotics with PBS, concentrating the mixture 10x, and spotting onto solid LB + 30 ug/mL DAP, overlayed with a 0.45 uM nitrocellulose filter (Millipore). Conjugations proceeded for 6 hours, after which the filter paper was removed, bacteria resuspended in LB medium, and plated on selective DAP-free medium.
To predict RNA secondary structure across open reading frames, we calculated the minimum folding energy across each CDS using a 30 bp sliding window with the Vienna RNA Suite. To construct plots, for each nucleotide position, the folding energy was averaged across all analyzed genes. Here, to avoid the confounding variable of translational coupling, we limited analysis to a test set of genes that did not overlap with upstream CDSs (n=464).
The program TranstermHP ( Kingsford et al., 2007 59. Kingsford, C.L. ∙ Ayanbule, K. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Rapid, accurate, computational discovery of Rho-independent transcription terminators illuminates their relationship to DNA uptake Genome Biol. 2007; 8 :R22 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to predict rho-independent transcriptional terminators on both strands. Default parameters for stem-loop and tail scoring were used. The confidence threshold for calling a terminator was left as >76.
For RBS strength predictions, thermodynamic parameters were calculated in accordance with ( Salis et al., 2009 102. Salis, H.M. ∙ Mirsky, E.A. ∙ Voigt, C.A. Automated design of synthetic ribosome binding sites to control protein expression Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27 :946-950 Crossref Scopus (1220) PubMed Google Scholar ). This calculation is summarized as: Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 = Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐴 : 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐴 + Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 + Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 − Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑦 − Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐴
This Gibbs free energy calculation above is converted to a predicted translation initiation rate(TIR), simplified as: 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑅 = 𝐴 − 𝛽 ⁡ ( Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ) where β = 0.45, and A = 2,500.
To collect the Gibbs Free Energy values, the Vienna RNA Suite was used ( Lorenz et al., 2011 75. Lorenz, R. ∙ Bernhart, S.H. ∙ Höner zu Siederdissen, C. ... ViennaRNA package 2.0 Algorithms Mol. Biol. 2011; 6 :26 Crossref Scopus (2441) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following assumptions were made: the relevant mRNA considered was +/- 35 bp flanking the start codon. The ribosome was assumed to unfold the first 15 bp of the ORF. The standby site was 4 bp upstream of the rRNA binding site, and the relevant anti-Shine Dalgarno rRNA sequence considered was the terminal 9 bp of 16S rRNA (for E. coli , this sequence is “ACCUCCUUA”). The Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 values used were: “AUG”:-1.194, “GUG”:-0.0748, “UUG”:-0.0435, “CUG”:-0.03406. To account for multiple mRNA:rRNA folding configuration possibilities, we used the RNAduplex program to duplex the rRNA to the region of the mRNA 3-13 bp upstream of the start codon. All possible duplexes +/- 1.5 kcal/mol of the MFE were considered; for each possible duplex, Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 was calculated. The duplex that minimized Δ ⁢ 𝐺 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 was considered the equilibrium translation initiation configuration.
Yeast promoters (see also Data S1 ) were constructed from individual modular components. “Core” and “UAS” sequences were sourced from previous literature ( Redden and Alper, 2015 96. Redden, H. ∙ Alper, H.S. The development and characterization of synthetic minimal yeast promoters Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7810 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spacer sequences were constructed by creating random 30 mers (that lacked NTG sequences to prevent internal start codons) and surveying for a lack of transcription factor binding sites derived from the YeastTract database ( Monteiro et al., 2020 81. Monteiro, P.T. ∙ Oliveira, J. ∙ Pais, P. ... YEASTRACT+: a portal for cross-species comparative genomics of transcription regulation in yeasts Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :D642-D649 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcription start site sites were pulled from the native S. cerevisiae genome, binning for sites that had been empirically validated with SAGE experiments and contained the canonical yeast transcription start site motif ( Zhang and Dietrich, 2005 139. Zhang, Z. ∙ Dietrich, F.S. Mapping of transcription start sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using 5′ SAGE Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :2838-2851 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yeast promoters were combinatorially assembled, ensuring that no permutation of three UASs was repeated in the library to minimize sequence similarity, and no spacer or TSS sequence is reused. Each promoter was scanned with the RBS predictor to highlight potential start sites, which were iteratively removed by altering spacer sequences. To deplete nucleosome occupancy, NuPoP was used to predict nucleosome occupancy. Each promoter was specifically assayed for the probability of nucleosome occupancy at the TATA box and TSS. 5 mer poly A or poly T sequences were added to spacers until nucleosome occupancy fell below 20% probability at both sites. To terminate any unexpected translation initiation from inside the promoter sequence, promoters are flanked with a three-frame stop codon (TAANTAANTAA). Promoters were additionally scanned for rho-independent transcription termination using TransTermHP.
To collect data presented in Figure S1 , the open reading frame of the eGFP gene was recoded to test 8 conditions: 1) using the base codon distribution of E. coli highly expressed genes; 2) using the base codon distribution of B. subtilis highly expressed genes; 3) using a neutral base codon distribution where codons are selected fully randomly; 4) using a base codon distribution enriched in inhibitory codons TTA, AGG, CTA, and CGA; 5) sequences enriched in internal predicted RBS sequences (using E. coli base codon distribution); 6) sequences enriched in predicted internal transcription terminators (using E. coli base codon distribution); 7 ) sequences with the N-terminal 12 residues consisting of codons enriched in E. coli highly expressed genes; and 8) sequences with the N-terminal 12 residues consisting of FACSseq-enriched codons from Goodman et al. Science 2013. For conditions 1-6, the N-terminal 36bp sequence was fixed. For conditions 7-8, the C terminal (bp 37+) sequence was fixed. For all coditional, the RBS was fixed. For each condition, 12 GFP genes were recoded and synthesized. For testing, recoded GFP genes were cloned into a vector (p15A origin of replication; spectinomycin selection) under the control of a T7 promoter, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C with 250rpm shaking. At OD 600 0.6, 100μM IPTG was added, and cultures incubated for an additional 6 hours. Single cell fluorescence was measured using a BD FACS Aria cell sorter and quantified with FlowJo software.
Fluorescent measurements ( Figures 4 C, 4D, 5 B, S1 , S3 , and S4 ) were performed with the BD FACS Aria cell sorter. For experiments where higher throughput was needed ( Figures 3 E–3I), the Stratedigm 8 with a 96 well plate loader was used. For these analyses, cell cultures were grown, induced when necessary at OD 600 of 0.6, and cultured for an additional 12 hours. Cells were diluted 1:10 in PBS and loaded onto the instrument. Quantification was done with FlowJo v10. Briefly, the cell population was gated with the forward scatter and side scatter channels, before quantifying fluorescent intensity in the FITC channel. Across all data sets, to assign a uniform fluorescent Intensity value (as arbitrary units), the raw fluorescent mean value was normalized, via linear scalar, such that the intensity of the cyc1 promoter sample in each data set was “100”.
Fluorescent measurements for evaluating the performance of the T7RNAP circuit ( Figures 4 E–4G, 5 °C) were performed on a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader. Here, cell cultures were diluted 1:50 into fresh LB + antibiotics. At OD 600 0.6, cultures were distributed across a 96 well plate (150 uL per well). As needed, inducers were added and the plate was cultured in a shaking incubator for an additional 12 hours. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS and transferred to a black well clear bottom 96 well plate. OD 600 and GFP fluorescence (488 nm ex, 525 nm em) values were measured. To quantify cell density – normalized fluorescence, GFP values were divided by OD 600 values. These values were further background subtracted using the average GFP/ OD 600 values of wildtype cells.
Violacein pigment was quantified as “Violacein Units” ( Blosser and Gray, 2000 13. Blosser, R.S. ∙ Gray, K.M. Extraction of violacein from Chromobacterium violaceum provides a new quantitative bioassay for N -acyl homoserine lactone autoinducers J. Microbiol. Methods. 2000; 40 :47-55 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pigment producing cells were cultured in LB at 30 °C until mid-log optical density. Upon adding relevant inducers, culture was continued at 20 °C for 48 hours. 200 uL of the final culture was diluted in 800 uL PBS to measure OD 660nm to quantify cell density. Another 200 uL of the culture was mixed with 200 uL 10% SDS for 5 mins with vortexing. 900 uL butanol was added and vortexed for 5 sec to extract pigment. Samples were pelleted in 1.5 mL tubes at 16000 × g for 5 mins to pellet debris. The top organic layer was collected and Absorbance 585nm was measured to quantify violacein content. Violacein units are calculated as: 𝑉 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑈 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑠 = 𝐴 5 8 5 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑚 / 𝑂 ⁢ 𝐷 6 6 0 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑚 × 1 0 0 0
Ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectra were recorded on an Agilent 1260 Infinity system equipped with a photo diode array (PDA) detector (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The full nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data sets were recorded at 25 °C on an Agilent 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (DD2) equipped with an inverse cold probe (3 mm), employing standard NMR pulse libraries, including 1D 31 P (202 MHz) and 1 H- 31 P decoupling experiments. Flash column chromatography was performed on LiChroprep RP 18 (40–63 mm, Merck, NJ, USA). High pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis was conducted on an Agilent 1260 Infinity system using a Phenomenex Luna C 18 (2) (100 Å) 5 μm (4.6 × 150 mm) (Phenomenex, CA, USA) column or a Hypercarb column (ThermoFisher Scientific Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, 5 μm, 4.6 × 100 mm) using a PDA detector coupled with a single quadrupole electrospray ionization mass spectrometry instrument (ESI-MS, Agilent 6120). Purification of metabolites addressed in the study was performed using an Agilent Prepstar HPLC system using an Agilent Polaris C 18 -A 5 μm (21 × 250 mm) column, a Phenomenex Luna C 18 (2) (100 Å) 10 μm (10 × 250 mm) column, or a Hypercarb column (ThermoFisher Scientific; 5 μm, 10.0 × 250 mm). High-resolution ESI-MS (HR-ESI-MS) data were recorded on an Agilent iFunnel 6550 quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS instrument fitted with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source linked to an Agilent 1290 Infinity HPLC system with the aforementioned columns. XAD-7 HP resins for metabolite extraction were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific. NMR data is provided in Data S3 .
Metabolomics was performed to investigate gene and pathway-dependent metabolites to promote discovery and characterization. For this characterization, we transformed redesigned BGC08 into E. coli BL21(DE3) (this stain was transformed with a plasmid-bound copy of the R6K pir gene to maintain the pPath vector carrying the pathway). A 5 mL LB liquid culture with 50 μg/mL of spectinomycin and 50 μg/mL carbenicillin was prepared as starter cultures by inoculation of single colonies containing either the full pathway, single gene knockouts, or its empty vector, pPath. Upon overnight growth under aerobic conditions (37 °C and 250 rpm), each seed culture (50 μL) was used to inoculate 5 × 5 mL fresh M9 cultures (M9 medium supplemented with 5% casamino acids, 0.2% D-glucose, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 ) and incubated (37 °C and 250 rpm) until the OD 600 reached 0.8 absorbance units. Cultures were induced with IPTG induction (0.1 mM) on ice and then grown for an additional 48 hours (20 °C and 250 rpm). An M9 medium control was also treated under identical conditions. Cultures were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g (r.t.) for 30 min, XAD-7 HP resins (20 g/L) were added to each clarified supernatant, and the resin-supernatant mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and 250 rpm. The filtered resins were then extracted with MeOH (10 mL each), and the extracts were filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to generate representative crude materials for medium controls, empty vector controls, and full pathway samples. These samples were subjected to HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis followed by comparative metabolomics using Mass Profiler Professional (Agilent Technologies) and methods that we have previously described ( Vizcaino et al., 2014 127. Vizcaino, M.I. ∙ Guo, X. ∙ Crawford, J.M. Merging chemical ecology with bacterial genome mining for secondary metabolite discovery J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2014; 41 :285-299 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). The metabolomics analysis revealed pathway-dependent molecular features, and a large-scale cultivation was implemented to garner a feasible amount of those metabolites by high-resolution mass-directed isolation for further studies (i.e., NMR-based structural elucidation, absolute configuration analysis, and bioactivity investigation). A starter culture of the full pathway prepared as described above was used to inoculate 1 × 24 L of the supplemented M9 medium, and cultivation was proceeded with identical conditions as used for the metabolomics studies. The culture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g (r.t.) for 30 min, and the clarified supernatants were incubated with XAD-7 HP resins for 2 h (37°C and 180 rpm). The pooled filtered resins were extracted with MeOH (24 L in total), and the methanolic extract was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure with a stream of nitrogen gas to produce the crude material. The crude extract (∼200 g) was subjected to a gravity column packed with LiChroprep RP 18 (500 g; 5 × 20 cm) with a step-gradient elution (0→100% MeOH in water, 10% MeOH increment, 500 mL each) to generate 11 fractions (Fr.1–Fr.11). Among these fractions, Frs.6 and 7 were found to contain target entities based upon single quadrupole LC-MS analysis. These two fractions were combined (Fr.6-7) and further purified employing prep RP HPLC equipped with an Agilent Polaris C 18 -A column (5→50% MeCN in water with 0.01% TFA for 60 min, 8 mL/min, 1 min collection interval). The LC-MS traces of these HPLC fractions showed that Fr. 6-7→15–25 possessed the targeted metabolites based on their masses and retention times. Repetitive semi-prep HPLC experiments (Phenomenex Luna C 18 (2); 5→10% MeCN in water with 0.01% TFA) led to the individual purification of the targeted entities. Feeding studies to corroborate the biosynthetic pathway from 2 to 4 were performed with the addition of 1 mM of 2 to the pathway with tybC knocked out. 100 mM IPTG was used for induction. A similar protocol was employed to identify a fatty acid to comprise m/z 753; 1 mM of octanoate was added to the full pathway cultivation together with IPTG induction ( Data S3 ).
The configuration of the tyrosine motif was established as S via Marfey’s analysis ( Bhushan and Brückner, 2004 10. Bhushan, R. ∙ Brückner, H. Marfey’s reagent for chiral amino acid analysis: a review Amino Acids. 2004; 27 :231-247 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The stereochemical assignment of the carbohydrate moiety was accomplished utilizing rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) NMR analysis, and the absolute structures of both 2 and phospho-tyrolose ( 1 ) were confirmed using synthetic standards (via a Zn 2+ -catalyzed reaction; Chanda and Harohally, 2018 22. Chanda, D. ∙ Harohally, N.V. Revisiting Amadori and Heyns synthesis: critical percentage of acyclic form play the trick in addition to catalyst Tetrahedron Lett. 2018; 59 :2983-2988 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ).
E. coli , K. aerogenes , P. putida , and S. enterica were domesticated with integrated landing pads for T7RNAP production, which was modulated with an induction gradient of theophylline. In B. subtilis , this landing pad was present on the pBroad vector. Pathways were cloned on the conjugative pPath vector, which site-specifically integrates into the landing pad in bacteria, and can be dually maintained centromerically in S. cerevisiae . For Gram-negative bacteria, pathway expressing strains were cultured in 5 mL M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose + 0.2% casamino acids at 30 °C. Upon reaching OD 600 0.6, inducers were added, and cultures grown further for 48 hours at 20 °C. For Gram-positive bacteria, pathway expressing strains were cultured in 5 mL LB at 30 °C. Upon reaching OD 600 0.6, inducers were added, and cultures grown further for 48 hours at 30 °C. For yeast, cultures were grown in 5 mL complete synthetic medium (CSM) with 2% glucose for 48 hours at 30 °C. Complete cultures were then dried via vacuum using a GeneVac system at full vacuum and no added heat. Once dried, metabolites were extracted with 500 uL methanol. Brief heating at 60 °C and sonication were applied until the extraction produced a homogenous slurry. The slurry was centrifuged at 15000 × g for 10 mins to pellet debris and clarified supernatant was loaded for LC/MS (Agilent QTOF 6550) analysis (1 uL injection volume). Resulting data was analyzed with Agilent Quantitative Analysis software – EIC integrations were performed with 20 ppm error, using exact m/z masses calculated by ChemDraw Pro.
L. iners was cultivated on Chocolate Agar at 37 °C in anaerobic conditions for 48 hours until visible colonies appeared. Colonies were inoculated into liquid NYCIII medium and further cultivated for 48 hours in anaerobic conditions. Cultures were diluted 1:100 into 5mL fresh NYCIII medium. After overnight incubation, inducers (aTc, tetracycline, and mucin) were added and cultures continued to grow for 24 hours. Cultures were dried under vacuum at RT, and extracted with 500μL methanol. The slurry was centrifuged at 15000 × g for 10 mins to pellet debris and clarified supernatant was loaded for LC/MS (Agilent QTOF 6550) analysis (1 uL injection volume). Resulting data was analyzed with Agilent Quantitative Analysis software.
The PURExpress kit (NEB) was used in accordance with manufacture’s protocol to assay for the in vitro production of GFP. For each sample a 25 uL reaction was performed containing 100 ng DNA or 500 ng RNA template encoding GFP (transcription in this kit is via T7RNAP), plus indicated amounts of purified compound dissolved in H 2 O. Reactions were loaded into a white 384 well plate and production of fluorescent GFP protein was monitored with a Synergy Ht Plate Reader (Bio-tek). Fluorescence reached an endpoint at 4 hours. To produce DNA template, a PCR product of the pT7-GFP gene was amplified (Kapa HiFi Polymerase) and purified by gel electrophoresis followed by gel purification (Qiagen). To produce RNA template, the DNA PCR product was transcribed with the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB), treated with DNase1, and purified by the Monarch RNA Purification Kit (NEB). RNA was quantified by Qubit.
To purify His-tagged proteins for in vitro biochemistry, individual genes were cloned into a pET28a vector backbone, preserving the N-terminal His tag of the vector, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were inoculated into 1L terrific broth with kanamycin selection, and cultured at 37 °C shaking at 250RPM. At OD 600 0.6, 200μM IPTG was added and cultures incubated for an additional 12 hours at 20 °C. Cultures were centrifuged at 4000rpm for 20 minutes to pellet cells. The pellet was resuspended in 8mL His lysis buffer (50mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300mM NaCl, 10mM Imidazole, adjusted to pH 7.4) + 10mg Lysozyme + 1 cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roache). The suspension was incubated at RT for 30 minutes, then sonicated (10 seconds on, 10 seconds off at 60% amplitude for 3 mins). Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14000g for 30 minutes. The debris was re-extracted with 1.5mL Solulyse reagent (AmsBio) for 10 minutes at RT. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14000g for 10 minutes and lysate collected. 1mL Nickel NTA resin was equilibrated in a chromatography column with 2mL His wash buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 300mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20mM Imidazole, adjusted to pH 7.4). Lysate was added and incubated with resin for 60 minutes with gentle agitation. Column was washed twice with 3mL His wash buffer and once again with 3mL His wash buffer containing 50mL Imidazole. 1mL His elution buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 300mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 250mM Imidazole, adjusted to pH 7.4) was added and incubated with resin for 60 minutes with gentle agitation. After eluting, 2 subsequent 1mL elutions were performed. Elutions were concentrated in 10kD centrifugation filters (Amicon) and buffer exchanged into PBS. Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE gels were used to assess purity of individual elution fractions.
TybC reactions were performed in a buffer of 100mM Tris and 10mM MgCl 2 , adjusted to pH 7.4. Substrates (L-Tyr and ribose donors) were used at 1mM, and enzyme was used at 10μM. TybE reactions were performed in a buffer of 100mM Tris and 10μM ZnCl 2 , adjusted to pH 7.4. Substrates (tyrolose and phosphor-tyrolose) and co-factors (NADH and NADPH) were used at 1mM, and enzyme was used at 10μM. TybB reactions were performed in a buffer of 100mM Tris, 10mM MgCl 2 , 10mM KCl, 10mM DTT, adjusted to pH 7.4. Tyrolose and tyrolitol were used at 1mM, ATP was used at 6mM, and enzyme was used at 10μM. For each, 20uL reactions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C, quenched with equal parts acetonitrile, and were loaded for LC/MS (Agilent QTOF 6550) analysis. Resulting data was analyzed with Agilent Quantitative Analysis software – EIC integrations were performed with 20 ppm error, using exact m/z masses calculated by ChemDraw Pro.
To collect RNA from S. cerevisiae , 3 mL cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD media + hygromycin for selection. Cultures were back-diluted 1:50 into fresh medium and grown until OD 600 1.0. 1 mL of this culture was processed using the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen), using the manufacturer’s zymolase protocol for lysis. To collect RNA from E. coli , 3 mL cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB + 50 ug/mL carbenicillin for selection. Cultures were back-diluted into fresh medium and grown until OD 600 0.6. 0.5 mL of this culture was processed using the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer’s lysozyme protocol for lysis. In all cases, in-column DNase treatment and the gDNA removal column were used to eliminate gDNA. Total RNA was quantified by nanodrop. Approximately 100 ng RNA was used in each 20 uL qPCR reaction using the Luna one-step universal RT-qPCR kit (NEB) run on a CFX Connect RT system (Bio-Rad). The cycling conditions were: (1) 55 °C for 10 min (2) 95 °C for 1 min (3) 95 °C for 10 sec (4) 60 °C for 30 sec (5) Measure SYBR (6) Goto step 3, 40x (7) melt curve analysis 60 °C to 95 °C.
The amino acid sequence for the TybB tRNA synthetase protein was used to Blast “All genomes” on the DOE Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbes (IMG) database with an E-value cutoff of 1e-5. Of the resulting 113 homologs found, each was manually curated to verify that the synthetase lacked an RNA binding domain, as predicted by the InterPro server, and that it was co-localized in an operon containing at least one additional biosynthetic enzyme, resulting in 92 hits. We observed 24 general operon architectures, which are shown in Figure 7 B. A species-level phylogenetic tree was constructed with phyloT, populated with NCBI taxonomy data, and visualized with iTOL. Operon schematics were constructed with the Python package DNAplotlib. Additionally, an alternate phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the relatedness of the tRNA synthetases in the pathways, shown in Data S3 . For this organizational scheme, all tRNA synthetases were pairwise aligned using the MUSCLE aligner. Finally, to perform a gene cluster-level BLAST search, cBlaster was used with the parameters - E value max: 0.01; Min sequence identity: 20%; Minimum hits: 2; and Require: TybB. To cleanly visualize the results in Figure S8 , strains from the same species were condensed into single entries. The raw, uncondensed data can be found in Data S5 .
The synthesis of tyrolose ( 2 ) was achieved with reference to a previous study deliberating Amadori and Heyns synthesis ( Chanda and Harohally, 2018 22. Chanda, D. ∙ Harohally, N.V. Revisiting Amadori and Heyns synthesis: critical percentage of acyclic form play the trick in addition to catalyst Tetrahedron Lett. 2018; 59 :2983-2988 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ). In brief, L-Tyr (1 g) was added into an Erlenmeyer flask with 70 mL MeOH and 5 mL of acetic acid. Subsequently, D-ribose (1 g) was loaded into the reaction flask followed by Zn(OAc) 2 (10 mg) and the reaction mixture was refluxed. The reaction progress was monitored every 2 h with single-quadrupole LC-MS analysis, and upon ∼6 h the reaction was completed. The resultant solution was passed through Celite 545 and the infiltrate was dried under vacuum and subjected to prep RP HPLC equipped with an Agilent Polaris C 18 -A column (5→50% MeCN in water with 0.01% TFA for 60 min, 8 mL/min, 1 min collection interval). The generated HPLC fractions were analyzed with single-quad LC-MS and tyrolose was detected in Frs. 16-24. Synthetic tyrolose was analyzed with the natural one utilizing QTOF-MS to verify the structural assignment of natural tyrolose. Tyrolitol and other tetrahydroxypentyl tyrosines were synthetically prepared with appropriate pentoses using a reported reductive amination synthetic strategy ( Wang et al., 2007 131. Wang, Y. ∙ Bi, L. ∙ Hou, B. ... Design and synthesis of pentahydroxylhexylamino acids and their effect on lead decorporation Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2007; 20 :609-615 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ): to a mixture of 0.40 g of NaOH in 3 mL of MeOH/H 2 O (1.5 mL each), 10 mmol of L-tyrosine was charged and stirred at room temperature until the amino acid was dissolved fully. D-ribose, arabinose, lyxose, or xylose (1.5 g) was added and the reactions were kept at room temperature to dissolve each pentose. Under nitrogen protection, the mixtures were subjected to 50-60 °C for 5 h. An ice bath was used to cool the reactions before addition of sodium borohydride (1 g), otherwise a significant amount of hydrogen gas was generated abruptly. The sodium borohydride-mediated reduction was performed at room temperature and the production of tyrolitol and tetrahydroxypentyl tyrosines were examined with single quadrupole LC-MS analysis. Upon completion of the reductions, the reaction mixtures were again cooled to 0 °C and the pH was adjusted to 2.5. The crudes were then concentrated and subjected to RP-HPLC purification (Agilent Polaris C 18 -A column, 5→20% MeCN in water with 0.01% TFA for 60 min, 8 mL/min, 1 min collection interval). Synthetic tyrolitol and related products were detected in Frs. 10-15 and chromatographically compared to natural materials using HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis, which confirmed the structure of natural tyrolitol and the degradation product of tyrocitabine-626 ( 4 ). To produce degradation products for study, tyrocitabine-626 ( 4 ) was placed in acidic H 2 O (pH 4) for two weeks at r.t., and analyzed utilizing QTOF-HPLC-MS along with other tetrahydroxypentyl tyrosines ( Data S3 ).
For all statistical analysis and curve fitting, the software GraphPad Prism was used. For determining r 2 correlation values ( Figures 3 G, 3H, and 3I), we performed ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression. For determining statistical significance, a 2-tailed t-test was performed. For statistical significance, the cutoff is ∗ p < 0.05. For all flow cytometry and plate reader data, individual conditions were collected as biological replicates, and for each replicate at least 50000 cells were quantified. Where error bars are shown, mean and standard deviation are plotted. Similarly, for all LC/MS quantification of metabolite production, and quantification of violacein production, 5mL cultures were grown in biological triplicate and extracted, with significance quantified with a 2 tailed t-test.
For quantifying significance in the difference between the distributions in Figure 2 E, a 2-tailed paired Z-test was performed using mean, variance, and sample size of the frequency distributions calculated by GraphPad Prism. The significance level tested against the null hypothesis was p < 0.001.
For the calculation of mRNA gene expression of the reporter mUkGFP used to evaluate the yeast promoters ( Figure 3 G), the ΔΔC q method was used ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 73. Livak, K.J. ∙ Schmittgen, T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2 −ΔΔCT method Methods. 2001; 25 :402-408 Crossref Scopus (120231) PubMed Google Scholar ). For these experiments, an equivalent plasmid backbone which lacked a defined yeast promoter upstream of GFP was as the control. Values are plotted as a fold change over this no-promoter control. As internal reference genes for normalization, for S. cerevisiae UBC6 was used, and for E. coli cysG was used. Samples were collected as biological triplicates.
To quantify IC 50 values for translation inhibition activity ( Figure 6 E), raw fluorescence values were linearly converted to percent activity. The fluorescence of the no template control was used to background subtract the data set and activity was proportionally scaled relative to the no inhibitor control. GraphPad Prism was used to plot a hyperbolic non-linear regression.
