Title: Structural basis for RNA surveillance by the human nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex


Abstract: Summary

RNA quality control relies on co-factors and adaptors to identify and prepare substrates for degradation by ribonucleases such as the 3′ to 5′ ribonucleolytic RNA exosome. Here, we determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complexes bound to RNA that reveal mechanistic insights to substrate recognition and early steps that precede RNA handover to the exosome. The structures illuminate ZCCHC8 as a scaffold, mediating homodimerization while embracing the MTR4 helicase and flexibly anchoring RBM7 to the helicase core. All three subunits collaborate to bind the RNA, with RBM7 and ZCCHC8 surveying sequences upstream of the 3′ end to facilitate RNA capture by MTR4. ZCCHC8 obscures MTR4 surfaces important for RNA binding and extrusion as well as MPP6-dependent recruitment and docking onto the RNA exosome core, interactions that contribute to RNA surveillance by coordinating RNA capture, translocation, and extrusion from the helicase to the exosome for decay.

Section: Introduction

RNA quality control pathways ensure the integrity of the transcriptome ( Doma and Parker, 2007 21. Doma, M.K. ∙ Parker, R.

Cellular RNA surveillance in Health and disease Science. 2019; 366 :822-827 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Defective, unprocessed, or spurious coding and non-coding transcripts are destroyed to prevent production of unwanted proteins, their aberrant accumulation, or their incorporation into R-loops or essential ribonucleoprotein complexes, e.g., ribosome, spliceosome, and telomerase. In eukaryotes, the transcriptome is subject to surveillance by the 3′ to 5′ ribonucleolytic RNA exosome to maintain a functional pool of RNA ( Houseley et al., 2006 40.

Besides quality control, the exosome is responsible for general RNA turnover and maturation of precursor RNAs. The nuclear exosome consists of a nine-subunit core (EXOSC1-9) bound to a distributive ribonuclease EXOSC10/RRP6 and a processive ribonuclease DIS3 ( Gerlach et al., 2018 31.

To correctly target diverse substrates, the RNA exosome requires guidance and associates with RNA adaptor complexes, typically composed of a helicase bound to auxiliary RNA binding proteins, and co-factors such as MPP6 and/or C1D that recruit helicases to the exosome ( Schuch et al., 2014; Wasmuth et al., 2017 75.

In human nuclei, known adaptor complexes include the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, the Poly(A) exosome targeting (PAXT) connection, or polysome protector complex (PPC) and the TRF4-2-ZCCHC7-MTR4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex ( Lubas et al., 2011 52.

NEXT is composed of three core subunits, namely MTR4, RBM7, and ZCCHC8 ( Figure 1 A) ( Lubas et al., 2011 52. Lubas, M. ∙ Christensen, M.S. ∙ Kristiansen, M.S. ... Interaction profiling identifies the human nuclear exosome targeting complex Mol. Cell. 2011; 43 :624-637 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ). MTR4 is a superfamily 2 DExH-box 3′ to 5′ RNA helicase intimately tied to functions of the nuclear exosome ( Fairman-Williams et al., 2010 26. Fairman-Williams, M.E. ∙ Guenther, U.P. ∙ Jankowsky, E.

An Mtr4/ZFC3H1 complex facilitates turnover of unstable nuclear RNAs to prevent their cytoplasmic transport and global translational repression Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :1257-1271 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). MTR4 has a helicase core characterized by a ring-like arrangement of two RecA-like ATPase modules (RecA1 and RecA2) with winged helix (WH) and helical bundle (HB) domains ( Jackson et al., 2010 42. Jackson, R.N. ∙ Klauer, A.A. ∙ Hintze, B.J. ...

Sci. 2010; 107 :12139-12144 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Uniquely, MTR4 contains an arch-like protrusion with a KOW domain connected to the helicase core by an elongated anti-parallel coiled-coil motif (Stalk). The helicase activity of human MTR4 is comparatively weak but is enhanced when bound to nuclear exosomes or in complexes with RBM7 and ZCCHC8 ( Puno and Lima, 2018 68. Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

RBM7 is an RNA-binding protein initially described to associate with splicing factors, presumably to target intronic RNA for decay ( Guo et al., 2003 35. Guo, T.B. ∙ Boros, L.G. ∙ Chan, K.C. ... Spermatogenetic expression of RNA-binding motif protein 7, a protein that interacts with splicing factors J. Androl. 2003; 24 :204-214 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has a single RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) that binds single-stranded RNA. While RBM7 can interact with other RNA sequences, it prefers uridine-rich motifs about 20 nucleotides upstream of the non-polyadenylated or short polyadenylated 3′ ends of NEXT substrates ( Hrossova et al., 2015 41. Hrossova, D. ∙ Sikorsky, T. ∙ Potesil, D. ...

Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). As U-rich motifs are not strictly required, the observed specificity may reflect a conformational preference for flexible single-stranded RNA. RBM7 is recruited to MTR4 by ZCCHC8, a protein with a single zinc knuckle (ZK) motif, a proline-rich domain in spliceosome-associated protein (PSP) module that binds RBM7 ( Falk et al., 2016 28. Falk, S. ∙ Finogenova, K. ∙ Melko, M. ... Structure of the RBM7–ZCCHC8 core of the NEXT complex reveals connections to splicing factors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13573-13610 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that interacts with MTR4 and stimulates its helicase and ATPase activities ( Puno and Lima, 2018 68. Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, structures are limited to individual subunits or binary complexes of peptides or domains, and there are no available structures for intact nuclear exosome adaptor complexes bound to RNA, making it difficult to understand how these complexes work to identify and capture RNA for delivery to the exosome.
Here, we illuminate roles for human NEXT in RNA surveillance by presenting biochemical and structural evidence that RBM7 and ZCCHC8 surveil upstream RNA motifs to provide specificity and to facilitate capture of free 3′ ends by MTR4. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of NEXT reveal a dimeric architecture that contributes to RNA translocation in vitro and to RNA decay in vivo . Consistent with ZCCHC8-mediated NEXT dimerization, we show that cancer-associated ZCCHC8-ROS1 fusion dimerizes and activates the kinase. Finally, our structures reveal that the ZCCHC8 scaffold covers surfaces important for RNA translocation and MTR4 interaction with the nuclear exosome, suggesting hierarchical interactions that need to be remodeled before NEXT could release RNA for decay.

Section: Results

To determine the architecture and basis for RNA engagement by NEXT, the human NEXT core complex (referred to as NEXT for simplicity) was reconstituted using full-length MTR4, RBM7 RRM residues 6–86, and the ZCCHC8 core with a low-complexity region (residues 416–507) truncated. The NEXT core complex exhibits similar helicase activity as one containing full-length proteins ( Puno and Lima, 2018 68. Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). A complex between the NEXT core and a 3′ tailed RNA stemloop (substrate 1) was prepared in the presence of ATP ( Figures S1 A and S1B). A 2′-amino-butyryl-pyrene-conjugated uridine (U py ) was included upstream of the 3′ end to present a bulky chemical group to stall NEXT and the helicase as it tracks along RNA. Insertion of U py in the 3′ tail of a duplex RNA suppressed helicase activity of NEXT ( Figure S1 C). Cryo-EM data were collected, and data processing yielded a consensus three-dimensional (3D) map with a nominal resolution of 4.06 Å ( Figures S1 D–S1F and S2 A–S2D).
The overall reconstruction revealed a homodimer with a flexible asymmetric bilobed structure ( Figure S2 A). Each lobe includes a complex of ZCCHC8-RBM7-MTR4 bound to RNA. The reconstruction revealed two regions of asymmetry, one at the dimer interface and another proximal to the helicase core that includes RBM7 and elements of ZCCHC8. To resolve structural heterogeneity and enhance local features, rounds of focused three-dimensional (3D) refinement and classification were performed across regions of the complex that culminated in five reconstructions with resolutions ranging from 3.26 Å to 4.40 Å ( Figures S2 D–S2F; Table S1 ). Maps were combined to generate a composite map ( Figures 1 B and S2 A) that was used to build and refine a model for NEXT ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S2 A–S2G, and S3 A; Table S1 ). To determine if RNA was responsible for bringing two ZCCHC8-RBM7-MTR4 complexes together, data were collected on reconstituted apo NEXT that produced a reconstruction with a similar asymmetric homodimeric architecture to the RNA-bound complex, albeit at lower resolution (8.36 Å), showing that NEXT dimerization is not dependent on RNA ( Figures S3 B–S3D, Table S1 ).
Structures of MTR4 are similar between protomers with respect to helicase core domains (RecA1, RecA2, WH, and HB) with each forming a compact fold and RNA-binding channel ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S4 A). The arch module protrudes from the helicase core and adopts a closed conformation where the KOW domain rests adjacent to RecA2 in proximity to the entry site of the RNA channel ( Weick et al., 2018 85. Weick, E.-M. ∙ Puno, M.R. ∙ Januszyk, K. ...

Nucleotide was not observed in the MTR4 ATP-binding cleft, as it presumably dissociated during purification. The configuration of MTR4 helicase core domains in NEXT resembles those observed for MTR4 bound to ATP ( Wang et al., 2019 80. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Wu, G. ... NRDE2 negatively regulates exosome functions by inhibiting MTR4 recruitment and exosome interaction Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :536-549 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), ADP ( Puno and Lima, 2018 68. Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), or the ATP analog AMPPNP with a translocating RNA ( Weick et al., 2018 85. Weick, E.-M. ∙ Puno, M.R. ∙ Januszyk, K. ...

Ozgur, S. ∙ Buchwald, G. ∙ Falk, S. ... The conformational plasticity of eukaryotic RNA-dependent ATPases FEBS J. 2015; 282 :850-863 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ).
ZCCHC8 scaffolds the architecture of NEXT. The N-terminal region of ZCCHC8 contains a homodimerization domain (HD, residues 1–175) that features a parallel coiled-coil domain and α helices flanking a strand-exchanged β sheet core ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The strand-exchanged β sheet core appears symmetric, but the parallel coiled-coil domain does not adhere to the 2-fold axis as illustrated by our ability to separate two distinct classes during structure determination ( Figure S1 F). A Dali search of ZCCHC8 HD showed no significant similarity to known protein folds ( Holm, 2020 39. Holm, L. Using dali for protein structure comparison Methods Mol. Biol. 2020; 2112 :29-42 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). Homotypic interactions between ZCCHC8 HD domains include hydrogen bonding between exchanged β strands and an interface that is largely hydrophobic ( Figures 2 B and 2C).
The ZCCHC8 homodimer orients two MTR4 helicases head-to-head by interacting with the MTR4 KOW domain via ZCCHC8 residues 176–216 (KOW-interacting domain, KID) and through contacts with ZCCHC8 HD of the other protomer ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and 2D–2F). The structure shows that the ZCCHC8 KID includes a single eight-amino-acid arch-interaction motif (AIM) spanning residues 177–184 that is defined by a consensus sequence xωxxD(x) 1/2 G/P ( Thoms et al., 2015 79.

Lingaraju, M. ∙ Johnsen, D. ∙ Schlundt, A. ... The MTR4 helicase recruits nuclear adaptors of the human RNA exosome using distinct arch-interacting motifs Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3393-3411 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) where ω is an aromatic residue (Phe178 in ZCCHC8) ( Figures 2 D and S4 E). ZCCHC8 Phe178 makes hydrophobic contacts to MTR4 Val766, while ZCCHC8 Asp181 interacts with MTR4 Arg743. Consistent with contacts observed in NEXT, mutations in ZCCHC8 residues Phe178 and Asp181 as well as MTR4 Arg743 impair ZCCHC8 AIM peptide interactions with MTR4 KOW ( Lingaraju et al., 2019 49. Lingaraju, M. ∙ Johnsen, D. ∙ Schlundt, A. ... The MTR4 helicase recruits nuclear adaptors of the human RNA exosome using distinct arch-interacting motifs Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3393-3411 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike extended unstructured AIMs observed for NVL ( Lingaraju et al., 2019 49. Lingaraju, M. ∙ Johnsen, D. ∙ Schlundt, A. ... The MTR4 helicase recruits nuclear adaptors of the human RNA exosome using distinct arch-interacting motifs Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3393-3411 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) and NRDE2 ( Wang et al., 2019 80. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Wu, G. ... NRDE2 negatively regulates exosome functions by inhibiting MTR4 recruitment and exosome interaction Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :536-549 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), the ZCCHC8 AIM is embedded in the β sheet of the ZCCHC8 dimer preconfigured to bind the MTR4 KOW ( Figures 2 B and S4 E). The ZCCHC8 KID extends well beyond the AIM and includes residues 185–216 that interact within a mostly aliphatic interface of the MTR4 KOW before extending to a side of the KOW domain that faces the RNA entry site of the helicase ( Figures 2 A and 2F).
The middle region of ZCCHC8 (amino acids 269–403) interacts with RBM7 to tether it to the helicase core of MTR4 ( Figure 3 A). Contacts between ZCCHC8 and the RBM7 RRM are established by the ZCCHC8 PSP domain between residues 285 and 324 ( Falk et al., 2016 28. Falk, S. ∙ Finogenova, K. ∙ Melko, M. ... Structure of the RBM7–ZCCHC8 core of the NEXT complex reveals connections to splicing factors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13573-13610 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Extending from the PSP in both directions are elements that reach two distinct surfaces of the MTR4 RecA2 domain through ZCCHC8 residues 270–275 (MTR4 anchor 1, MA1) and residues 328–337 (MTR4 anchor 2, MA2) ( Figure 3 A). ZCCHC8 MA1 binds MTR4 via ZCCHC8 Arg273 interaction with an acidic patch formed by MTR4 Glu400 and Glu990 and via ZCCHC8 Tyr274 that packs against a hydrophobic crevice in MTR4 ( Figure 3 B). ZCCHC8 MA2 forms a strand that extends the β sheet of MTR4 RecA2 and contains aliphatic residues Leu335 and Tyr336 that contact MTR4 L328 and H329, respectively ( Figure 3 C). ZCCHC8 residues 355–403 return from MTR4 to interact with the backside of the PSP domain ( Figure 3 A). The last portion of ZCCHC8 observed is the CTD that includes residues 659–701. Consistent with our prior structure ( Puno and Lima, 2018 68. Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), the ZCCHC8 CTD extends across the base of the helicase core and RNA exit channel ( Figure 1 C).
Based on these structures, it is clear that several interactions between ZCCHC8 and MTR4 are mutually exclusive with MTR4 interactions observed in complexes with the nuclear RNA exosome ( Weick et al., 2018 85. Weick, E.-M. ∙ Puno, M.R. ∙ Januszyk, K. ... Helicase-dependent RNA decay illuminated by a cryo-EM structure of a human nuclear RNA exosome-MTR4 complex Cell. 2018; 173 :1663-1677.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) or other exosome co-factors in complexes with TRAMP ( Falk et al., 2014 27. Falk, S. ∙ Weir, J.R. ∙ Hentschel, J. ... The Molecular architecture of the TRAMP complex reveals the organization and interplay of its two catalytic activities Mol. Cel. 2014; 55 :856-867 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) and NRDE2 ( Wang et al., 2019 80. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Wu, G. ... NRDE2 negatively regulates exosome functions by inhibiting MTR4 recruitment and exosome interaction Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :536-549 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S4 F–S4J). NRDE2, a negative regulator of the exosome, is reported to inhibit the interaction of MTR4 with ZCCHC8 ( Wang et al., 2019 80. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Wu, G. ... NRDE2 negatively regulates exosome functions by inhibiting MTR4 recruitment and exosome interaction Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :536-549 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this model, NRDE2 and ZCCHC8 interact with surfaces that overlap on the MTR4 KOW and RecA2 domains ( Figures S4 F–S4J), but unlike ZCCHC8, NRDE2 binding was proposed to be incompatible with binding to RNA ( Wang et al., 2019 80. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Wu, G. ... NRDE2 negatively regulates exosome functions by inhibiting MTR4 recruitment and exosome interaction Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :536-549 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Superposing NRDE2 and NEXT structures suggests that RNA could be accommodated between the RecA domains in the NRDE2 complex; however, NRDE2 coordinates the arch and KOW in an even more closed configuration relative to NEXT, potentially blocking RNA ingress in the NRDE2 complex ( Figures S4 G and S4H). The conserved MTR4 RecA2 binding motifs of S. cerevisiae TRAMP subunits Air2 and Trf4 structurally resemble those of ZCCHC8 MA1 and MA2, respectively ( Figures S4 I and S4J) ( Falk et al., 2014 27. Falk, S. ∙ Weir, J.R. ∙ Hentschel, J. ... The Molecular architecture of the TRAMP complex reveals the organization and interplay of its two catalytic activities Mol. Cel. 2014; 55 :856-867 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the ZCCHC8 MA2 motif is inverted relative to the Trf4 RecA2 binding motif, making it difficult to predict in the absence of structure. Because surfaces that contribute to NEXT, TRAMP, and NRDE2 interactions with MTR4 are overlapping or mutually exclusive, these observations support a pivotal role for these co-factors in specifying the identity and function of MTR4 in these complexes.
Clear densities for RNA (substrate 1) are evident in the MTR4 helicase core and are proximal to RBM7 RRM in protomers A and B ( Figures 1 B and S3 A). Compared to translocated RNA in structures of the human MTR4-bound nuclear exosome ( Weick et al., 2018 85. Weick, E.-M. ∙ Puno, M.R. ∙ Januszyk, K. ... Helicase-dependent RNA decay illuminated by a cryo-EM structure of a human nuclear RNA exosome-MTR4 complex Cell. 2018; 173 :1663-1677.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ), the RNA 3′ end is not extruded but is rather captured between the RecA domains of the helicases in both protomers of NEXT ( Figures S4 A and S4D). While portions of the RNA substrate are visible, the inherent flexibility of the substrate and RNA-binding modules obscured the path for RNA, especially between MTR4 and RBM7. To improve density for RNA, RBM7, and elements of ZCCHC8, NEXT was loaded with a palindromic RNA duplex with 3′ tails on both strands (substrate 2), and cryo-EM data produced reconstructions that better defined an RNA path ( Figures S5 A–S5E). This RNA induced formation of a tetramer in ∼20% of particles with two NEXT homodimers cross-braced by two RNA substrates ( Figure 4 A). Once the tetramer was identified, signal from each protomer was isolated by signal subtraction and was then recentered and combined to generate reconstructions of RNA-bound NEXT at an overall resolution of 3.62 Å after post-processing ( Figures S6 A–S6D). Five focused refinements generated 3D reconstructions with overall resolutions ranging from 3.34 Å to 3.94 Å that were combined into a composite map to aid model building and refinement ( Figures 4 B, 4C, S6 A and S6D–S6G; Table S1 ).
Densities for RNA are evident, from the A-form duplex to the single-stranded 3′ overhang ( Figures 4 B and 4C). RBM7 RRM and ZCCHC8 ZK domains flank the oligo(U) tract ( Figures 4 C–4E). Three nucleotides (A15-U17) dock to RBM7 RRM, with the U16 nucleobase proximal to Phe13. Similar contacts between the RBM7 RRM and RNA were observed for the NEXT-substrate 1 complex ( Figure 4 F). The succeeding U18–U19 nucleotides point toward the ZCCHC8 ZK. A23–A25 protrude from the MTR4 RNA entry site, and the last five nucleotides A26-A30 are accommodated within the RNA channel of MTR4 mainly through polar interactions to the RNA backbone ( Figures 4 D, 4G, and 4H). Consistent with conformational selection and specificity for flexible single-stranded RNA upstream of the 3′ end, the U-rich motif and RNA path in NEXT is kinked relative to the RNA path in the human MTR4-exosome complex ( Figure 4 I). Our structures are also consistent with studies inferring contacts with isolated RRM ( Hrossova et al., 2015 41. Hrossova, D. ∙ Sikorsky, T. ∙ Potesil, D. ...

The human nuclear exosome targeting complex is loaded onto newly synthesized RNA to direct early ribonucleolysis Cel Rep. 2015; 10 :178-192 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) and crosslinking studies using intact NEXT that mapped interactions, 5′ to 3′, between RNA and RBM7, ZCCHC8, or MTR4 ( Puno and Lima, 2018 68. Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A hallmark of DExH-box helicases is a β hairpin that facilitates strand separation ( Büttner et al., 2007 11. Büttner, K. ∙ Nehring, S. ∙ Hopfner, K.-P.

The conformational plasticity of eukaryotic RNA-dependent ATPases FEBS J. 2015; 282 :850-863 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MTR4 β hairpin includes Phe504, a residue near the channel entrance that wedges between A26 and the incoming A25 nucleotide ( Figure 4 G). The observed RNA path in the helicase core of MTR4 resembles that of other MTR4-exosome complexes, but several other interactions are absent or different. For instance, MTR4 KOW domain surfaces that contact structured RNA in MTR4-exosome ( Weick et al., 2018 85. Weick, E.-M. ∙ Puno, M.R. ∙ Januszyk, K. ... Helicase-dependent RNA decay illuminated by a cryo-EM structure of a human nuclear RNA exosome-MTR4 complex Cell. 2018; 173 :1663-1677.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) and MTR4-ribosome complexes ( Schuller et al., 2018 76. Schuller, J.M. ∙ Falk, S. ∙ Fromm, L. ... Structure of the nuclear exosome captured on a maturing preribosome Science. 2018; 360 :219-222 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ) are occluded by the ZCCHC8 KID ( Figure 4 I). Like RNA in the structure of dimeric NEXT, upstream RNA is directed away from the MTR4 KOW domain and is coordinated between RBM7 and ZCCHC8. Furthermore, the CTD of ZCCHC8 blocks the RNA exit path and occludes MTR4 surfaces required for interaction with the exosome via contacts to EXOSC2 and MPP6, a nuclear co-factor that tethers MTR4 to the exosome ( Wasmuth et al., 2017 82. Wasmuth, E.V. ∙ Zinder, J.C. ∙ Zattas, D. ... Structure and reconstitution of yeast Mpp6-nuclear exosome complexes reveals that Mpp6 stimulates RNA decay and recruits the Mtr4 helicase.

Collectively, these contacts suggest that our structures represent early steps in RNA recognition after the 3′ end is captured but before it is extruded from MTR4 in a process that is likely dependent on ZCCHC8 CTD remodeling and/or exosome recruitment.
Our structures reveal that NEXT is a homodimer mediated by ZCCHC8. To determine if ZCCHC8 can form homodimers in human cells, we immunoprecipitated mCherry-tagged ZCCHC8 as prey from cells expressing wild-type (WT) GFP-ZCCHC8 or HD-deleted GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔHD as bait. WT GFP-ZCCHC8, but not GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔHD , co-precipitated mCherry-ZCCHC8 ( Figure S7 A), consistent with HD-driven dimerization of ZCCHC8. Analysis of endogenous NEXT by size-exclusion chromatography indicated an apparent molecular weight of ∼1000 kiloDalton (kDa) ( Ogami et al., 2017 62. Ogami, K. ∙ Richard, P. ∙ Chen, Y. ... An Mtr4/ZFC3H1 complex facilitates turnover of unstable nuclear RNAs to prevent their cytoplasmic transport and global translational repression Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :1257-1271 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), a size that is larger but consistent with the apparent molecular weight of ∼800 kDa for recombinant NEXT ( Figures S7 B and S7C). No smaller species were evident for endogenous or recombinant complexes, suggesting that NEXT is dimeric.
Each NEXT protomer of RBM7, ZCCHC8, and MTR4 is bound to RNA, suggesting that each protomer works independently. To determine if dimerization contributes to NEXT activities, we employed electromobility shift assay (EMSA) to measure binding at steady state and a molecular beacon helicase assay (MBHA) to measure kinetics of unwinding under pre-steady state conditions. In general, equilibrium binding constants from EMSA agree with apparent substrate affinities obtained from kinetic plots. EMSA data reveal that NEXT binds the U-rich tailed RNA with a K D of 42 nM and a Hill coefficient close to 2, indicating cooperative binding, while deletion of ZCCHC8 HD (NEXT ΔHD ) yields a 2-fold defect in RNA binding and loss of cooperativity ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Comparing RNA unwinding activities reveals 7-fold lower maximal unwinding rate ( V max ) for NEXT ΔHD compared to NEXT ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S7 D). To determine if each MTR4 helicase must be active in the dimer to maximize activity, differentially tagged MTR4 and catalytically inactive MTR4 with a glutamine substitution of Glu253 residue (denoted as "EQ") required for ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding were used to reconsitute a heterodimeric NEXT WT/EQ complex ( Puno and Lima, 2018 68. Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). NEXT WT/EQ activities are more similar to NEXT ΔHD , with slightly worse-than-expected kinetics for strand displacement based on comparison to a stoichiometric mixture of WT (NEXT WT/WT ) and catalytically inactive (NEXT EQ/EQ ) homodimers ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S7 D).
Human MTR4 binds 3′ A 20 -and U 20 -tailed substrates with similar affinities, whereas NEXT exhibits better binding and unwinding activity for poly(U)-containing 3′ tailed substrates that are dependent on RBM7 RRM ( Hrossova et al., 2015 41. Hrossova, D. ∙ Sikorsky, T. ∙ Potesil, D. ...

Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, RBM7 RRM contacts the upstream oligo(U)-rich motif in our structures ( Figures 4 D–4F). Consistent with sequence specificities or a preference for flexible single-stranded RNA upstream of the 3′ end, NEXT exhibits ∼10-fold better affinity (EMSA K D ) and 3-fold higher V max for RNA with an oligo(U)-containing 3′ tail (A 5 U 5 A 10 ) relative to one with a poly(A) 3′ tail (A 20 ) ( Figures 5 E–5L, S7 E, and S7F). Unlike U-rich motifs, poly(A) forms a more rigid helical structure ( Brahms et al., 1966 10. Brahms, J. ∙ Michelson, A.M. ∙ Van Holde, K.E. Adenylate oligomers in single- and double-strand conformation J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 15 :467-488 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Hashizume and Imahori, 1967 38. Hashizume, H. ∙ Imahori, K. Circular dichroism and conformation of natural and synthetic polynucleotides J. Biochem. 1967; 61 :738-749 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tang et al., 2019 78. Tang, T.T.L. ∙ Stowell, J.A.W. ∙ Hill, C.H. ... The intrinsic structure of poly(A) RNA determines the specificity of Pan2 and Caf1 deadenylases Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 266 :433-442 Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar ), so poly(A) would need to bend in NEXT to adopt the kinked RNA path observed in our structures with U-rich RNA.
To probe determinants that impart specificity for U-rich motifs, alanine substitutions of RBM7 RRM Phe13 and Phe52 (F13A/F52A, denoted as "FAFA") were introduced to NEXT to generate NEXT FAFA , mutations previously shown to reduce binding affinity to pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides for isolated RBM7 RRM ( Hrossova et al., 2015 41. Hrossova, D. ∙ Sikorsky, T. ∙ Potesil, D. ... RBM7 subunit of the NEXT complex binds U-rich sequences and targets 3′-end extended forms of snRNAs Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :4236-4248 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). This complex exhibited a 3-fold defect in binding affinity and a 5-fold lower V max for 3′-(A 5 U 5 A 10 )-tailed substrate compared to NEXT ( Figures 5 E, 5F, 5I, 5J, and S7 E). For comparison, NEXT FAFA displayed ∼2-fold defect in similar assays with 3′ A 20 -tailed substrate ( Figures 5 G, 5H, 5K, 5L, and S7 F). So while RBM7 prefers oligo(U)-rich motifs, these data suggest that RBM7 also contributes to binding oligo(A) single-stranded RNA. ZCCHC8 ZK is proximal to the U-rich tract in our structures. To determine if it contributes to RNA substrate specificity, ZCCHC8 ZK was deleted (ΔZK) and NEXT ΔZK was reconstituted. NEXT ΔZK exhibited slightly slower rates for unwinding 3′-(A 5 U 5 A 10 ) or 3′-(A 20 ) relative to WT NEXT ( Figures 5 I–L, S7 E, and S7F), but it unexpectedly resulted in a 4-fold improvement in binding to the 3′ A 20 -tailed RNA ( Figures 5 G and 5H). As affinities for 3′-(A 5 U 5 A 10 ) tailed RNA remained similar between NEXT ΔZK and NEXT, these data suggest that the ZCCHC8 ZK discriminates against poly(A) tails, perhaps by conformational selection of non-structured single-stranded RNA or a kinked RNA path as observed in our structures. Apparent substrate affinities ( K 1/2 ) derived from helicase assays follow similar trends to that observed in equilibrium binding assays ( Figures 5 F, 5H, and S7 G).
ZCCHC8 contributes to NEXT activities in vitro as evidenced by a reduction in strand displacement activity for the HD mutant and improved binding to poly(A) RNA for the ZK mutant. To evaluate functional contributions of ZCCHC8 HD and ZK deletions in cells, ZCCHC8 CRISPR-Cas9 knockout HAP1 cells were transfected with doxycycline-inducible constructs of GFP-ZCCHC8, GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔHD , or GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔZK . Stable clones were isolated, confirmed for expression and nuclear localization of ectopic ZCCHC8 constructs, and sorted for GFP expression prior to analysis of NEXT-targeted PROMPT RNAs using qPCR ( Figures 5 M and S8 A–S8C). ZCCHC8 null cells accumulated PROMPT RNAs that could be rescued by expression of WT GFP-ZCCHC8 and GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔZK . In contrast, cells expressing GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔHD exhibited a defect in suppressing PROMPT RNA levels, consistent with reduced helicase activity observed for ZCCHC8 ΔHD in vitro . RNA seq analysis confirms accumulation of PROMPT and to lesser extent enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels in cells expressing GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔHD compared to GFP-ZCCHC8, while a marginal change was observed for 3′ extended small nuclear RNA (snRNA) levels ( Figures 5 N–5P, S8 D, and S8E). Consistent with global analysis, differences are also observed in coverage snapshots of select NEXT targets ( Figure S8 E). To confirm these results, we generated CRISPR-Cas9-edited ZCCHC8 ΔHD HAP1 cells ( Figures S9 A and S9B); however, genomic deletion of HD resulted in reduced mRNA and protein levels ( Figures S9 C–S9E).
Mutations in NEXT subunits are associated with various diseases, and our structures provide a three-dimensional context to interpret their effects. Genetic lesions in ZCCHC8 map to either HD or KID ( Figure 6 A). A nonsense mutation L90× in HD results in a truncated protein and is linked to autosomal recessive intellectual disability ( Najmabadi et al., 2011 59. Najmabadi, H. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Garshasbi, M. ... Deep sequencing reveals 50 novel genes for recessive cognitive disorders Nature. 2011; 478 :57-63 Crossref Scopus (763) PubMed Google Scholar ). Leucine substitution of Pro186 (ZCCHC8 P186L ) is observed in a family with 3 members afflicted with an autosomal-dominant pulmonary fibrosis, a common premature-aging disorder characterized by shortening of the telomeres ( Gable et al., 2019 29. Gable, D.L. ∙ Gaysinskaya, V. ∙ Atik, C.C. ... ZCCHC8, the nuclear exosome targeting component, is mutated in familial pulmonary fibrosis and is required for telomerase RNA maturation Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :1381-1396 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pro186 is situated in a loop region in KID, adjacent to the AIM sequence ( Figure 6 B). While the side chain of Pro186 faces the dimerization domain of the other ZCCHC8 chain ( Figure 6 A), it lies in the interface between ZCCHC8 and the MTR4 KOW ( Figure 6 B). P186L may prevent NEXT assembly, perhaps contributing to reduced steady-state levels observed in patient cells ( Gable et al., 2019 29. Gable, D.L. ∙ Gaysinskaya, V. ∙ Atik, C.C. ... ZCCHC8, the nuclear exosome targeting component, is mutated in familial pulmonary fibrosis and is required for telomerase RNA maturation Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :1381-1396 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to ZCCHC8 mutations, aberrant chromosomal translocations lead to fusion of ZCCHC8 HD residues 1–80 or 1–105 to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) domain of ROS1 (residues 1927–2347) ( Figure 6 C). ROS1 is a proto-oncogenic RTK with unknown physiological function in humans ( Drilon et al., 2021 22. Drilon, A. ∙ Jenkins, C. ∙ Iyer, S. ... ROS1-dependent cancers — biology, diagnostics and therapeutics Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 18 :35-55 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet several ROS1 gene fusions occur in cancer, most involving a diverse fusion partner to the C-terminal kinase domain ( Davies and Doebele, 2013 18.

Kinase fusions are frequent in Spitz tumours and spitzoid melanomas Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3116-3119 Crossref Scopus (480) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the ZCCHC8 structure, the fusion is predicted to disrupt plasma membrane localization and induce dimerization of the ROS1 kinase, perhaps further activating it through trans -autophosphorylation ( Drilon et al., 2021 22. Drilon, A. ∙ Jenkins, C. ∙ Iyer, S. ... ROS1-dependent cancers — biology, diagnostics and therapeutics Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 18 :35-55 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine if ZCCHC8 residues 1–80 are sufficient to dimerize the ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase fusion, immunoprecipitation was performed. While GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase immunoprecipitated mCherry-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase , no interaction was detected between GFP-ROS1 kinase and mCherry-ROS1 kinase ( Figure 6 D). Three mutations (C56E/L63E/L70E, denoted as “dm”) were introduced in the ZCCHC8 1−80 coiled-coil to disrupt the dimer interface ( Figure S9 F). GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80dm -ROS1 kinase failed to precipitate mCherry-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase ( Figure S9 G). We next sought to determine if ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase interacts with ZCCHC8 to form NEXT-ROS1 heterodimers; however, GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase did not immunoprecipitate mCherry-ZCCHC8 ( Figure S9 H). These data suggest that ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase can self-oligomerize in human cells but does not form heterodimers with full-length ZCCHC8.
Related RTKs can be activated by oligomerization ( Du and Lovly, 2018 23. Du, Z. ∙ Lovly, C.M. Mechanisms of receptor tyrosine kinase activation in cancer Mol. Cancer. 2018; 171 58–13 Crossref Scopus (560) Google Scholar ; Schlessinger, 2000 73. Schlessinger, J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases Cell. 2000; 103 :211-225 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), so autophosphorylation of the ROS1 kinase domain was analyzed as a surrogate for kinase activation using Phos-tag gels. A band shift was observed for GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase but not for GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80dm -ROS1 kinase and GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase(dead) with kinase inactivating K1980M mutation ( Figure 6 E), supporting a model for homodimerization-dependent autophosphorylation within the ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase fusion. Phospho-specific flow cytometry analysis further showed ∼3-fold greater levels of phosphorylated ROS1 (pROS1) in cells expressing GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase relative to cells expressing GFP-ROS1 kinase and GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80dm -ROS1 kinase ( Figures 6 F, 6G, S9 I, and S9J). Although phosphorylated GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80dm -ROS1 kinase was not detected in Phos-tag gels, phospho-flow analysis showed similar levels of pROS1 for cells expressing ROS1 kinase and GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80dm -ROS1 kinase compared to cells expressing GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase(dead) . Together, these data suggest that dimerization of ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase could further activate the ROS1 kinase by trans -autophosphorylation.

Section: Discussion

RNA quality control begins as nascent transcripts emerge from cellular transcription machinery ( Figure 7 ). The nuclear cap-binding CBP20-CBP80 complex (CBC) first sequesters the 5′ cap and participates in dynamic interactions with different factors that determine RNA fate ( Rambout and Maquat, 2020 70. Rambout, X. ∙ Maquat, L.E. The nuclear cap-binding complex as choreographer of gene transcription and pre-mRNA processing Genes Dev. 2020; 34 :1113-1127 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). ARS2 and ZC3H18 then associate with CBC-bound transcripts and co-transcriptionally recruit RNA adaptor complexes that surveil unprotected 3′ termini of coding and non-coding transcripts to ultimately choreograph their degradation by the exosome ( Andersen et al., 2013 3. Andersen, P.R. ∙ Domanski, M. ∙ Kristiansen, M.S. ... The human cap-binding complex is functionally connected to the nuclear RNA exosome Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :1367-1376 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Giacometti et al., 2017 32. Giacometti, S. ∙ Benbahouche, N.E.H. ∙ Domanski, M. ... Mutually exclusive CBC-containing complexes contribute to RNA fate Cell Rep. 2017; 18 :2635-2650 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). While structures of RNA-loaded MTR4-exosome complexes reflect the final stages of MTR4-assisted RNA decay pathway ( Gerlach et al., 2018 31. Gerlach, P. ∙ Schuller, J.M. ∙ Bonneau, F. ...

Here we illuminate cryo-EM structures of NEXT that suggest how NEXT subunits interact and cooperate with target RNA substrates for decay. NEXT assembles into a homodimer with two active MTR4 helicases, each capable of accommodating a 3′ end of RNA. ZCCHC8 mediates homodimerization, wrapping around MTR4 to occlude surfaces important for RNA binding while positioning the RNA-binding module of RBM7 next to the helicase core for recognition of single-stranded RNA upstream of the 3′ end. Beyond its role as a scaffold, ZCCHC8 interacts with RNA through its ZK motif, perhaps to ensure a kinked RNA path that discriminates against poly(A) tailed RNA substrates. Furthermore, ZCCHC8 covers surfaces of the MTR4 KOW that can interact with structured RNA ( Schuller et al., 2018 76. Schuller, J.M. ∙ Falk, S. ∙ Fromm, L. ... Structure of the nuclear exosome captured on a maturing preribosome Science. 2018; 360 :219-222 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weick et al., 2018 85.

The discrimination against poly(A) and preference for U-rich sequences may guide NEXT to RNA containing U-rich elements such as those adjacent to transcription termination or cleavage sites ( Di Giammartino et al., 2011 19.

In addition to cooperative binding, higher-than-expected activities are observed for the NEXT dimer, suggesting that the two helicases work together rather than independently ( Figures 5 and S7 ). How the two helicases communicate within NEXT remains unclear, but it is notable that 3D reconstructions of NEXT dimers reveal asymmetry with respect to densities corresponding to RBM7-ZCCHC8 and the coiled-coil domain at the dimer interface ( Figures S2 A and S3 D). The contribution of ZCCHC8 to NEXT activities is underscored by a human disease ZCCHC8 mutation P186L that lies at the interface between the two ZCCHC8 chains and MTR4, although it remains unclear if phenotypes are due to disruption of the dimer or to reduced expression in these patients or a combination of both ( Gable et al., 2019 29. Gable, D.L. ∙ Gaysinskaya, V. ∙ Atik, C.C. ... ZCCHC8, the nuclear exosome targeting component, is mutated in familial pulmonary fibrosis and is required for telomerase RNA maturation Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :1381-1396 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The discovery and structural basis for ZCCHC8 homodimerization sheds light on the functional consequences of the ZCCHC8-ROS1 fusion found in a variety of cancers. Many RTKs undergo dimerization upon ligand binding, subsequently leading to autophosphorylation and kinase activation ( Della Corte et al., 2018 15. Della Corte, C.M. ∙ Viscardi, G. ∙ Di Liello, R. ... Role and targeting of anaplastic lymphoma kinase in cancer Mol. Cancer. 2018; 171 :30-39 Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar ; Du and Lovly, 2018 23. Du, Z. ∙ Lovly, C.M. Mechanisms of receptor tyrosine kinase activation in cancer Mol. Cancer. 2018; 171 58–13 Crossref Scopus (560) Google Scholar ; Schlessinger, 2000 73. Schlessinger, J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases Cell. 2000; 103 :211-225 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ZCCHC8-ROS1 fusion truncates the extracellular domains, essentially making it insensitive to any ligands. Here we have shown that ZCCHC8-ROS1 fusion induces dimerization and autophosphorylation, potentially activating mechanisms that drive oncogenesis. Our structures provide a framework to evaluate a growing number of genetic mutations in subunits of the NEXT complex.
Structures of NEXT reveal an intriguing architecture that opens several questions related to its interactions with the exosome. ZCCHC8 CTD binding to MTR4 occludes surfaces important for exosome association with the helicase via MPP6 and EXOSC2. ZCCHC8 CTD also presents a steric occlusion to the RNA exit path through MTR4. Thus, ZCCHC8 CTD displacement or remodeling appear necessary before NEXT can deliver RNA to the exosome. It is intriguing that an analogous mechanism might contribute to substrate recognition and decay in the cytoplasm by the SKI-exosome complex ( Kögel et al., 2022 45. Kögel, A. ∙ Keidel, A. ∙ Bonneau, F. ... The human SKI complex regulates channeling of ribosome-bound RNA to the exosome via an intrinsic gatekeeping mechanism Mol. Cel. 2022; 82 :756-769.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subunit interactions within NEXT provide a means to couple interactions with the exosome to RNA extrusion from the helicase, but only after NEXT is fully engaged by a nuclear RNA exosome. It is noteworthy that the ZCCHC8 CTD and MPP6 both stimulate helicase-dependent activities of NEXT and the exosome, respectively ( Puno and Lima, 2018 68. Puno, M.R. ∙ Lima, C.D. Structural basis for MTR4-ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115 :E5506-E5515 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weick et al., 2018 85. Weick, E.-M. ∙ Puno, M.R. ∙ Januszyk, K. ... Helicase-dependent RNA decay illuminated by a cryo-EM structure of a human nuclear RNA exosome-MTR4 complex Cell. 2018; 173 :1663-1677.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ), perhaps to establish quality control by facilitating repeated attempts at RNA translocation and delivery while maintaining contacts between NEXT, the exosome, and RNA. The multivalency of contacts to MTR4 in NEXT and the nuclear exosome suggest that NEXT recruitment and RNA translocation could proceed through parallel or hierarchical paths, perhaps expanding potential mechanisms to regulate the process.
The diversity of RNA substrates in the nucleus is staggering, so it is perhaps remarkable that a single motor protein, MTR4, can be utilized by the RNA exosome, NEXT, TRAMP, PAXT, and other upstream co-factors to identify, discriminate, and eventually feed substrates to the nuclear exosome for processing or decay. MTR4 is granted this exceptional versatility by its ability to interact with protein co-factors and adaptors via mutually exclusive surfaces, thus ensuring specificity and perhaps a sequential hierarchy to these interactions. The single-engine, multiple-adaptor strategy is a recurrent theme in biology and is perhaps reminiscent of the Cdc48/p97 motor and its various adaptors that combine to promote specificity in processes ranging from disaggregation to processing and/or degradation by the proteasome ( Boom and Meyer, 2018 9. Boom, J. van den ∙ Meyer, H. VCP/p97-Mediated unfolding as a principle in protein homeostasis and signaling Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :182-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hänzelmann and Schindelin, 2017 36. Hänzelmann, P. ∙ Schindelin, H. The interplay of cofactor interactions and post-translational modifications in the regulation of the AAA+ ATPase p97 Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). As there are comparatively few complexes identified thus far that target RNAs for decay in the nucleus, it seems likely that additional factors, perhaps deposited on specific nascent RNAs, will contribute to RNA quality control and its regulation in the nucleus.
Our studies advance an understanding of how NEXT subunits work together to capture RNA, but many questions remain. Complexes containing full-length proteins may be required to define roles for the RBM7 CTD and ZCCHC8 low-complexity region. Additional structures are needed to reveal catalytic cycles including ATP-dependent RNA translocation and extrusion, perhaps by isolating NEXT-RNA complexes in various nucleotide-bound states. Deletion of HD significantly impairs NEXT, but its cellular effect is less severe than ZCCHC8 knockout, so it remains unclear how dimerization contributes to NEXT activities in cells. Perhaps defects are ameliorated by association with the nuclear exosome. With that said, it is worth noting that acute depletion of NEXT subunits results in milder accumulation of RNA targets compared to knockouts, presumably due to secondary effects ( Gockert et al., 2022 34. Gockert, M. ∙ Schmid, M. ∙ Jakobsen, L. ... Rapid factor depletion highlights intricacies of nucleoplasmic RNA degradation Nucleic Acids Res. 2022; 50 :1583-1600 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our cellular studies used fusions to a GFP variant with a monomerizing A206K mutation, but the impact of GFP fusions to ZCCHC8 warrants further analysis. As CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of HD resulted in diminished mRNA and protein levels, further work will be required to uncover mutations that impair dimerization without disrupting expression. Endogenous targets of NEXT are typically capped and bound to proteins ( Figure 7 ); however, our biochemical and structural studies use synthetic RNA, so it remains unclear how other proteins impact NEXT activities. Finally, structural and functional studies of NEXT-exosome complexes are needed to understand molecular determinants and the order of events associated with NEXT-dependent RNA decay such as ZCCHC8 CTD and/or MPP6 remodeling, the role of C1D and RRP6 in NEXT tethering to the exosome, and contributions of NEXT dimerization in exosome-mediated decay.

Chemically competent Escherichia coli E. cloni 10G cells (Lucigen) grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth or agar were used for molecular cloning of NEXT subunits and variants. Recombinant proteins were produced using E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) RIL (Agilent Technologies) cells cultured in Superbroth at 37°C with shaking (220 rpm for Innova 44R).
Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (Expi293F, Thermo Fisher Scientific) used for immunoprecipitation were maintained in serum-free Expi293 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C, 8% CO 2 and 80% humidity with a shake speed of 125 rpm according to manufacturer’s recommendations. All stably transfected Expi293F cells were generated using the piggyBac system. Piggybac-compatible plasmid constructs were subcloned from PB-TAG-ERPE ( Kim et al., 2015 44. Kim, S.-I. ∙ Oceguera-Yanez, F. ∙ Sakurai, C. ... Inducible transgene expression in human iPS cells using versatile all-in-one piggyBac transposons Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1357 :111-131 Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar ). 9.5 mL cell suspension with a density of 2.9 × 10 6 cells per mL were co-transfected with 7 μg of piggybac-compatible plasmids with the gene of interest under a tetracycline/doxycycline-inducible promoter, 1.5 μg plasmid containing a hyperactive piggybac transposase (pRP[Exp]-mCherry-CAG>hyPBase) (VectorBuilder), and 1.5 μg plasmid containing reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) with downstream internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and puromycin resistance gene (PB-rtTA-IRES-Puro). 24 h post-transfection, cells were subcultured into fresh media to a final density of 6 × 10 5 cells per mL, grown for another 24 h before stable integrants were batch-selected by treatment with 2 μg/mL puromycin for 1 week. After selection, cells were grown in antibiotic free medium for 1 week and protein expression was induced by treatment with 1 μg/mL doxycycline for at least 24 h prior to immunoprecipitation experiments.
Human HAP1 cells (Horizon Discovery) were grown in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . HAP1 cells were authenticated using short tandem repeat (STR) profiling at MSK Integrated Genomics Operations. Plasmid transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s protocol. 1.5 × 10 5 HAP1 ZCCHC8 CRISPR knockout cells (Horizon Discovery) were seeded into 2 mL medium and allowed to adhere in a 6-well plate overnight. Cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of piggybac-compatible plasmid with the gene construct downstream of a tetracycline/doxycycline-inducible promoter, 0.5 μg hyperactive piggybac transposase plasmid (pRP[Exp]-mCherry-CAG>hyPBase) (VectorBuilder), and 0.5 μg PB-rtTA-IRES-Puro. Stable integrants were batch-selected by treatment with 3–5 μg/mL puromycin for 1 week. Puromycin-selected cells were used for RNA sequencing experiments. For qPCR analysis of PROMPTs, stable clones were isolated as follows. Batch-selected cells were sorted for cells expressing similar levels of GFP using BD FACSAria and single cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate. Individual cells were grown and analyzed for ectopically-expressed WT and mutant ZCCHC8 levels. Stable clones expressing similar levels of GFP fusion constructs were treated with 5–10 ng/mL doxycycline for at least 24 h and sorted for GFP-positive cells using BD FACSAria prior to RNA extraction and qPCR analysis.
HAP1 cells (Horizon Discovery) were cultured in IMDM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . 1.5 × 10 5 cells were grown overnight in a 6-well plate and were co-transfected with 2 μg piggyBac-compatible plasmids with GFP fusion constructs under the control of tetracycline/doxycycline-inducible promoter, 1.5 μg pRP[Exp]-mCherry-CAG>hyPBase (VectorBuilder), and 1.5 μg PB-rtTA-IRES-Puro using Lipofectamine 3000 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Stably transfected cells were selected by treatment with 2 μg/mL puromycin for 1 week. Puromycin-selected cells were used for analysis of ROS1 autophosphorylation using Phos-tag gels and by flow cytometry.
A day prior to transfection, 1.5 × 10 5 HAP1 cells (Horizon Discovery) in 2 mL IMDM with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum were added into each well of a 6-well plate. Cells were transfected with 2.5 μg plasmid (pRP[2CRISPR]-mCherry-hCas9-U6>{hZCCHC8[gRNA#1]}-U6>{hZCCHC8[gRNA#2]}) containing two U6 promoter-driven guide RNA expression constructs, a human codon-optimized Cas9 construct and an mCherry reporter using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfected cells were placed in an incubator (37 °C and 5% CO 2 ) for 4 h before treatment with 2 μM NU7441 (StemCell Technologies) for 18 h. Individual mCherry-expressing cells were sorted using BD FACSAria, plated into a 48-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and grown for 1–2 weeks or until colonies appeared. Cells were screened for expression of ΔHD ZCCHC8 mRNA with forward primer: ATGGCCGCAGAGGTGTATTTTACT and reverse primer: TGCCTTTACTTGTATTTCTTGCCCTTC using Cells-to-CT 1-Step Power SYBR Green kit. Genomic DNA was prepared from the initial hits and was used for PCR amplification of ZCCHC8 gene fragment using forward primer: ATGCCGTCCTCCGGGCAATC and reverse primer: AGCCTAGGTTTAATTTAGAAGCGGTTGCCCCAATTTATC that flank the HD region. Amplicons were gel-purified using Qiagen gel extraction kit, cloned into pJET2.1 using CloneJet PCR cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and submitted for Sanger DNA sequencing (Eton Biosciences). Two CRISPR-edited HAP1 ZCCHC8 ΔHD clones were identified. ZCCHC8 ΔHD mRNA expression was quantified relative to GAPDH mRNA using PowerUp SYBR Green master mix with forward primer: CAACCGCTTCTAAATGAAAACCCTC and reverse primer TTCACTTATTCGAGCAGCATTCCGAGG. ZCCHC8 ΔHD protein expression was analyzed using Western blot analysis.
Recombinant proteins were produced and purified from bacterial cells. Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) RIL (Agilent Technologies) cells transformed with the expression plasmid construct were grown in Superbroth at 37°C with shaking (220 rpm for Innova 44R) until the OD 600 reached 1.8 (or >2 for MTR4 expression), then cooled in an ice-water bath for 20 min before addition of isopropyl-β- D -thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.25 mM. Cultures were then incubated at 18°C with shaking for another 16–20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g (Beckman JLA-8.1000) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets (15–20 g) were suspended in 200 mL of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 μg/mL DNAse I (Sigma), 1 μg/mL lysozyme (Sigma) and disrupted using a Branson Digital Sonifier 450 Cell Disruptor (1 s on, 1 s off, 55–60% output, 1 min per 20 g cell mass) before ultracentrifugation at 44,000 × g (Beckman JA-20) for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant lysate was incubated with 5–10 mL Ni 2+ -NTA (Qiagen) for an hour at 4 °C with rotation, poured into a gravity flow glass column (Bio-Rad), and beads were washed with 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP, 10 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted in buffer containing 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP, 250 mM imidazole, passed through a 0.2 μm Pall Acrodisc syringe filter and immediately applied to a 5-mL HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) using a 20-mL syringe. The heparin column was then connected to Akta pure chromatography system (GE Healthcare), washed with 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP and the bound proteins were separated using a salt gradient (Buffer A: 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP; Buffer B: 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8, 1000 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP; Target %B = 100% over 5–10 column volumes). For MTR4, tags for affinity purification were cleaved by treatment with Ulp1 ( Mossessova and Lima, 2000 57. Mossessova, E. ∙ Lima, C.D. Ulp1-SUMO crystal structure and genetic analysis reveal conserved interactions and a regulatory element essential for cell growth in yeast Mol. Cell. 2000; 5 :865-876 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and separated by size exclusion chromatography using HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare) in a buffered solution containing 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP. Reconstitution of the NEXT core complex was achieved by mixing a copurified heterodimer of His10-Smt3-RBM7/Smt3-ZCCHC8 constructs with 2-fold molar excess of MTR4 in the presence of Ulp1, followed by size exclusion chromatography using HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pg in a buffered solution containing 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP. Fractions containing three subunits were pooled, concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 50K MWCO filtration unit (used for all subsequent protein concentration step unless otherwise stated; Millipore), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until needed. PCR mutagenesis was used to generate mutations in DNA plasmids encoding NEXT subunits.
Recombinant heterodimeric NEXT containing both WT and helicase-dead MTR4 with E253Q mutation was reconstituted by incubating the purified His10-Smt3-RBM7/Smt3-ZCCHC8 heterodimer with an equimolar mixture of WT MTR4 with an N-terminal hexahistidine and non-cleavable Smt3 tag (with deletion of diglycine motif) and Strep-MTR4 E253Q in 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP supplemented with 1 μg Ulp1 per mg total protein at 4 °C for 4 h. Ni 2+ -NTA beads were added to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for another hour with gentle agitation. The beads were washed with 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP, 10 mM imidazole and bound proteins were eluted with 20 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP, 250 mM imidazole. The eluate was then applied to a 1 mL StrepTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) connected to an Akta pure chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP and the bound proteins were eluted with 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP, 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. Finally, the eluate was concentrated to 500 μL and proteins were separated using Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP.
RNA oligos were synthesized and HPLC-purified by Integrated DNA technologies (IDT) or Dharmacon Inc. Lyophilized RNA were dissolved in annealing buffer containing 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 7.0 and 100 mM potassium acetate and RNA concentrations were determined using Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To prepare the RNA duplexes, stoichiometric amounts of oligos were mixed, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, then cooled to 16 °C for 10 min, and further incubated at 4 °C overnight.
Proteins at indicated concentrations were mixed with 10 nM 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM)-labeled RNA substrate in solutions containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.0, 50 nM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM AMPPNP (Sigma), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 U/μL human placenta RNAse inhibitor (New England Biolabs). The protein-RNA mixtures were incubated at 22°C for 1 h before running samples (10 μL per well) in 4–20% Novex TBE gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with cold 0.5X Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) running buffer at 4°C for 1 h under a constant voltage of 220V. Gels were imaged using a Typhoon FLA 9500 laser scanner. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ 1.53a ( Schneider et al., 2012 74. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (42393) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RNA fraction bound was estimated by dividing the band intensities of remaining free RNA at various protein concentrations by the band intensity of total free RNA. Data were analyzed and plotted in GraphPad Prism. Dissociation constants ( K D s) were obtained by fitting the data to the Hill equation: fraction bound = (B max [P] h )/( K D h + [P] h ) where [P] is the protein concentration, h is the Hill’s coefficient, and B max is the maximal fraction bound.
For reaction, a mixture of 15 μL 10X assay buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.0, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 15 mM MgCl 2 ), 13.5 μL water, 15 μL 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 μL 40 units/μL human placenta RNAse inhibitor (New England Biolabs), 15 μL 100 nM RNA substrate and 75 μL 2X protein solution was prepared and incubated for 5 min at 22°C. Reactions were initiated by addition of 10 μL of a pre-mixed solution of 20 mM ATP·MgCl 2 (pH 7) and 4 μM DNA capture strand (5′-GCGTCTTTACGGTGCT -3′, IDT) per 90 μL reaction and mixtures were incubated at 30°C. Aliquots were taken at various time points and mixed at 1:1 ratio with a quench solution containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) xylene cyanol supplemented with 80 units per mL Proteinase K (New England Biolabs). Quenched aliquots were incubated at 30°C for 10 min to digest proteins. Samples (10 μL) were electrophoresed in a 20% Novex TBE gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 1X TBE running buffer (prechilled to 4°C) for 1 h under a constant voltage of 220V at 4°C. Gels were scanned using a Typhoon FLA 9500 laser scanner and rendered using ImageJ 1.53a ( Schneider et al., 2012 74. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (42393) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Proteins were mixed at indicated concentrations with 10 nM RNA substrate in a solution containing 20 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 U/μL human placenta RNAse inhibitor (New England Biolabs). Reaction mixtures (45 μL) were set up in a Corning 3693 half-area 96-well white plate, pre-incubated at 30°C for 5 min, and started by addition of 2 mM ATP·MgCl 2 (pH 7). Real time fluorescence was recorded every 30 s for 45 min at 30°C using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with excitation/emission wavelengths of 643/667 nm. The fraction of unwound substrate was calculated by dividing the baseline-corrected fluorescence value at each time point by the maximum fluorescence change achieved for a fully unwound substrate ( Belon and Frick, 2008 7. Belon, C.A. ∙ Frick, D.N. Monitoring helicase activity with molecular beacons Biotechniques. 2008; 45 :433-442 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Özeş et al., 2014 63. Özeş, A.R. ∙ Feoktistova, K. ∙ Avanzino, B.C. ... Real-time fluorescence assays to monitor duplex unwinding and ATPase activities of helicases Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :1645-1661 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initial rate of strand displacement was obtained by taking the slope of data points within the linear range of the reaction and kinetic data were further analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Initial rates ( v 0 ) were fitted to either v 0 = V max ∗ [E]/( K 1/2 + [E] ∗ /(1+[E]/ K ′ 1/2 )) (Equation 1) or v 0 = V max [E]/ K 1/2 (Equation 2) where [E] is the enzyme concentration, V max is the maximal strand displacement rate at enzyme saturation, and K 1/2 is the half-maximal rate enzyme concentration.
Protein standards (thyroglobulin, ferritin, aldolase, and conalbumin) and blue dextran from GE Healthcare gel filtration calibration (high molecular weight) kit were dissolved in 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP and mixed to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL each. 500 μL of the protein standard mixture or NEXT core complex (1 mg/mL) was injected to Superdex S200 increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) connected to an Akta pure chromatography system (GE Healthcare) and eluted in 20 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP. Partition coefficient ( K av ) was calculated using the equation: K av = (V e -V 0 )/(V c -V 0 ) where V e is elution volume, V 0 is column void volume and V c is the geometric column volume. Apparent molecular weight was estimated using a calibration curve obtained by plotting K av versus log(MW, kDa) of the protein standards.
RNA- and nucleotide-free NEXT (apo-NEXT) was obtained using purified recombinant core complexes with 260/280 nm absorbance ratio below 0.57 and used for subsequent preparation of NEXT in complex with RNA substrates 1 and 2. For NEXT-substrate 1 complex, 1 mL of 5 μM NEXT core complex was pre-incubated with a stoichiometric amount of RNA in 20 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.1 mM TCEP at 22°C for 10 min. ATP·MgCl 2 (pH 7.0) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 1 h. The RNA-loaded NEXT complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in a buffered solution containing 20 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP. For the sample containing RNA substrate 2, 5 μM NEXT core complex was incubated with equimolar amount of substrate on ice for 30 min. RNA-protein complexes were purified by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in a buffered solution containing 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP. Fractions from size exclusion chromatography were analyzed for protein content using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electrophoresed with 1× MES running buffer and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 solution. Co-purified RNA in each fraction was detected using 20% TBE PAGE gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electrophoresed in 1× TBE at 220V for 1 h at 4°C followed by SYBR Gold staining. Protein and RNA gels were imaged using Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+.
Prior to grid preparation, all RNA-protein samples were concentrated to 8 mg/mL as determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Apo-NEXT sample was concentrated to 6 mg/mL prior to use. IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) was added to samples to a final concentration of 0.02% (v/v) before vitrification. No crosslinking was performed for samples prior to vitrification. Approximately 3.5 μL of the concentrated samples were applied onto glow-discharged UltraAUFoil 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 grids (Quantifoil). After 30 s, grids were blotted for 2.5 s at 100% humidity and plunged into liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV.
For apo-NEXT and NEXT-substrate 1 complex, the grids were loaded on a Titan Krios 300kV electron microscope (FEI) equipped with a K2 Summit camera (Gatan) with a calibrated pixel size of 1.088 Å. Movies (40 frames per movie, 10 s exposure time) were collected automatically using SerialEM in super-resolution counting mode at a dose rate of 10 e−/pixel/second and a total dose of 67.6 e−/Å 2 /movie. For NEXT-substrate 2 complex, data acquisition was performed on a Titan Krios 300kV electron microscope (FEI) equipped with either K2 or K3 Summit direct detector (Gatan). For the data collected using the K2 camera (dataset 1), image stacks of 50 frames were recorded over 10 s in super-resolution counting mode at a dose rate of 10 e−/pixel/second for a total electron dose of 77.5 of e−/Å 2 /movie. For the data collected using the K3 camera (datasets 2 and 3), movies (40 frames per movie, 4 s exposure time) were recorded in super-resolution mode at a dose rate of 20 e−/pixel/second and a total dose of 66 e−/Å 2 /movie.
Image processing was performed in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 95. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) unless otherwise stated. Movie frames were corrected for drift and dose-weighted using MOTIONCOR2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 92. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ). Estimation of contrast transfer function (CTF) was performed using Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 91. Zhang, K. Gctf: real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2309) PubMed Google Scholar ). Movies with an estimated resolution at or better than 4.5 Å were selected for analysis. Around 300–1000 particles were manually picked from a random subset of micrographs to obtain 2D classes that were then used as templates for automated picking of the remaining particles. Autopicked particles were extracted into 384 pixel box size and binned by 3 prior to running several rounds of 2D classification to remove junk classes. Particles were extracted and unbinned before heterogenous 3D classification.
Two datasets were obtained for NEXT-substrate 1 complex at MSK Richard Rifkind Center for Cryo-EM. A total of 4905 movies were collected for the first dataset which subsequently gave rise to 440,122 autopicked particles. Particles were imported to cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 67. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3665) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate an ab initio model that was used as the initial reference model. After multiple rounds of 2D and 3D classifications in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 95. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), 270,441 particles were selected for 3D refinement and subsequent Bayesian polishing. The same procedure was used for the second dataset (3231 movies, 520,310 autopicked particles) and a total of 347,971 were selected and combined with the selected particles from the first dataset. The combined particle stack (618,412 particles) yielded a post-processed overall map with a nominal resolution of 4.06 Å after several cycles of particle polishing and 3D refinement. All subsequent data processing steps including signal subtraction, focused refinement, and focused 3D classification were performed in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 95. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Signal subtraction using a mask encompassing the MTR4 stalk and helicase core domains of both protomers and focused 3D classifications using different regularization parameter ( T ) values were performed to segregate the two orientations of ZCCHC8 N-terminal coiled-coil domains. At T = 50, the two coiled-coil classes were separated. The larger class was reverted back to original particles and subjected to 3D classification with image alignment prior to a focused 3D refinement of the region encompassing ZCCHC8 HD/KID and MTR4 KOW domains of the two protomers (Z8 HD/KID -MTR4 KOW map in Figure S1 ). To improve the local resolution of the two protomers, 3D classification with image alignment was performed on the combined particle stack. A class of 242,861 particles that displayed improved density for both protomers was selected and subjected to signal subtraction and local masked 3D classification (T = 40 and T = 20 for protomers A and B, respectively). Classes with well-defined signal for MTR4 and RBM7 were refined using a local masks enclosing MTR4 from either protomers (protomer A MTR4 and protomer B MTR4 maps in Figure S1 F) or pooled for another round of focused 3D classification (T = 80) on a region encompassing RBM7, ZCCHC8 PSP, and RNA prior to local refinement (protomer A MTR4 KOW -Z8 HD/KID -RNA and protomer B MTR4 KOW -Z8 HD/KID -RNA maps in Figure S1 F). A composite map was generated in Phenix by combining the overall map and the focused refinement maps of Z8 HD/KID -MTR4 KOW CC-1, MTR4 (A and B), and MTR4 KOW -Z8 HD/KID -RNA (A and B) regions.
Three datasets were obtained for the NEXT-substrate 2 complex. Dataset 1 was collected at NYSBC Simons Electron Microscopy Center while datasets 2 and 3 were collected at MSK Richard Rifkind Center for Cryo-EM. Movies collected in super-resolution mode were aligned and Fourier cropped to 1.1 Å prior to subsequent analysis. A total of 18,294 movies were collected that was pruned to 13,842 movies after manual inspection for ice contamination and exclusion of movies with an estimated resolution above 4.5 Å. 822,892 autopicked particles were subjected to 2D classification and 3D classification with image alignment to remove junk particles. Classes containing two NEXT homodimers cross-braced by RNA were selected and combined to a total of 368,334 particles. Several cycles of 3D refinement and Bayesian polishing were performed prior to another round of 3D classification with image alignment to identify a NEXT tetramer class (78,308 particles). At this stage, the particles were processed using RELION 3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 95. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). After 3D refinement, particles were subjected to signal subtraction using masks enclosing each protomer followed by recentering and global 3D refinement. This resulted in particles with isolated signal from each protomer, which were combined to a total 313,232 particles. Masked 3D refinement of the combined particle stack produced a map with a nominal resolution of 3.85 Å after post-processing. Local refinement was performed in a region encompassing MTR4 helicase core, ZCCHC8 PSP domain, RBM7, and RNA prior to 3D classification with no image alignment (T = 60). A class (252,638 particles) with improved density for RNA and RBM7 was identified that yielded a post-processed overall map with a resolution of 3.62 Å. Focused 3D refinement were subsequently performed using local masks that encompassed MTR4 core, MTR4 core-ZCCHC8 PSP-RBM7-RNA, RBM7-RNA, MTR4-ZCCHC8 HD/KID, and MTR4 KOW-ZCCHC8 HD/KID regions. These focused refinement maps and the overall map were post-processed and combined to generate a composite map in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix : a comprehensive python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
A total of 6705 movies were collected for apo-NEXT that afforded 465,038 autopicked particles. The best 2D class averages from multiple reference-free 2D classification steps were subjected to two rounds of 3D classification with image alignment. Homogenous 3D refinement, Bayesian polishing, and per particle defocus refinement were performed using 52,777 particles from the selected 3D classes. A consensus map with an overall resolution of 8.36 Å was obtained after post-processing ( Figure S3 D).

RBM7 RRM and ZCCHC8 PSP domains were docked into densities and manually rebuilt using the X-ray structure of a RBM7 RRM-ZCCHC8 PSP complex. ZCCHC8 HD and KID domains were built using a focused refinement map of the ZCCHC8 HD/KID -MTR4 KOW region. Other unknown regions of ZCCHC8 and RNA were initially built into EM densities of protomer A (NEXT-substrate 1 complex) after manual inspection using Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 24.

Model from protomer A (NEXT-substrate 1 complex) was used to rebuild into densities encompassing protomer B (NEXT-substrate 1 complex) as well as the NEXT-substrate 2 complex. Model geometry was analyzed using Molprobity ( Chen et al., 2010 12. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ...

Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged proteins was performed using a magnetic GFP-Trap kit (Chromotek). A 500 μL aliquot of lysate was diluted 3-fold with IP wash buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP), transferred into a 2 mL microcentrofuge tube, and incubated with 50 μL of GFP-Trap slurry in a Thermo Scientific tube revolver/rotator spinning at 10 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. Magnetic beads were collected using a DynaMag-2 and washed with IP wash buffer 3 times. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted using 1× LDS sample buffer supplemented with 1% (v/v) BME and detected by a Western blot analysis.
Samples in 1× LDS sample buffer supplemented with 1–5% (v/v) BME were electrophoresed in NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel using 1× MES running buffer and blotted onto 0.2 μm PVDF membrane using a semi-dry Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad) at a constant current of 24 mA for 8–10 min. Western detection was performed using the iBind Flex Western apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or WesternEaze-Chemi kit (Advansta). Alternatively, immunodetection was performed as follows: After transfer, the membrane was blocked using AdvanBlock-Chemi blocking solution (Advansta) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies diluted using AdvanBlock-Chemi blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. After two washes with 1× Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Tween (TBS-T) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody diluted in AdvanBlock-Chemi blocking solution for 1 h at 22 °C and then washed again 4 times with TBS-T for 15 min each wash at 22 °C. Finally, SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the membrane and chemiluminescence was visualized using Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+. The primary antibodies used were mouse anti-ZCCHC8 (1:500, Abcam), mouse anti-GFP (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific), mouse anti-mCherry (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific), mouse anti-beta-actin (1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and mouse anti-ROS1 (1:1000, Origene).

GFP-ZCCHC8, GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔHD , and GFP-ZCCHC8 ΔZK HAP1 cells were grown in a 4-well chambered slide with a glass bottom (ibidi) and treated with 15 ng/mL doxycycline for 24 h to induce expression of GFP-tagged proteins. An hour before imaging, the medium was supplemented with 1× NucSpot Live 650 dye (Biotium) and 100 μM verapamil (Biotium) to stain the cell nuclei. The slide was transferred to a Leica Inverted Confocal SP8 (Leica Microsystems) equipped with an environment chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Live cell imaging was performed with an HC PL APO CS2 63×/1.4 objective in fluorescence mode using 479 nm and 670 nm as excitation wavelengths. Confocal images were rendered using Fiji ImageJ 2.1.0 ( Schneider et al., 2012 74. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat.

Cell pellets were lysed in buffer supplemented with 50% (v/v) isopropanol and 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and RNA was extracted from the lysate using the MagMAX mir Vana Total RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the KingFisher Flex Magnetic Particle Processor (Thermo Scientific catalog # 5,400,630) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer with 10 million cells input. The purified RNA was quantified using Ribogreen assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and assessed for quality using Agilent BioAnalyzer. One μg of total RNA with an RNA integrity number varying from 9.3-10 underwent ribosomal depletion and library preparation using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with 8 cycles of PCR. Samples were barcoded and run on a NovaSeq 6000 in a PE100 run, using the NovaSeq 6000 S2 Reagent Kit (200 Cycles) (Illumina). An average of 56 million paired reads were generated per sample and 63% of the data mapped to the transcriptome.
HAP1 cells (4.5 × 10 6 ) stably transfected with doxycycline-inducible GFP fusion constructs of ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase , ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase(dead) or ZCCHC8 1−80dm -ROS1 kinase were grown in 150 mm dish overnight and then treated with 8, 16, or 8 ng/mL doxycycline for 24 h, respectively. Cells were trypsinized using TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed with PBS, and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mM EDTA) to a final density of 20 × 10 6 cells per mL. Cells were passed through a Corning 70 μm cell stainer and sorted for cells expressing low GFP levels ( Figure S9 J) using BD FACSAria at MSK Flow Cytometry core facility. Sorted cells were collected in IMDM with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum, pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g and resuspended in lysis solution containing 1× Laemlli buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with 250 units per mL Turbonuclease (Accelagen) and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. 1 mL lysis solution was used per 20 million cells. 10 μL of cell lysate was loaded into each well of SuperSep Phos-tag (50 μmol/L) 100 × 100 × 8.6 mm pre-cast 12.5% gel (Wako) and electrophoresed in cold 1× Tris/Glycine/SDS running buffer (Bio-Rad) at 200 V for 2 h at 4°C. Gels were washed three times with 30 mL 1× NuPage transfer buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% (v/v) methanol and 10 mM EDTA for 20 min each. Gels were subsequently washed three times with 30 mL 1× NuPage (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% (v/v) methanol for 10 min each. Proteins were transferred onto 0.2 μm PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Transfer Pack) using Trans-Blot Turbo semi-dry transfer apparatus (1.3 A, 25 V setting for 8 min) (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed for ROS1 using Western blot analysis.
HAP1 cells stably transfected with doxycycline-inducible GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase , GFP-ZCCHC8 1−80 -ROS1 kinase(dead) or GFP-ROS1 kinase were grown in T-75 flasks and treated with 8, 16, 8 ng/mL doxycycline for 24 h, respectively. Cells were trypsinized, stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed with PBS and fixed with 3.2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA for 20 min. After two washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS and permeabilized with 4.5 mL of ice-cold methanol for 20 min and washed two more times with PBS. Cells were transferred into 5-mL polypropylene tubes, blocked with staining solution (PBS with 5% fetal calf serum, 5 mM EDTA, 200 μg/mL IgG from human serum (Sigma)) and incubated for 1 h in staining solution with 1 μg/mL anti-phospho(Y2274)-ROS1 (pROS1) antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) labeled with AlexaFluor 647 (Zip rapid antibody labeling kit – Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were washed three times with PBS, resuspended in staining solution and analyzed for GFP and AlexaFluor 647 fluorescence using a Fortessa (BD Biosciences) instrument operated using the BD FACSDiva software. Gates and regions used for relative cellular pROS1 quantitation are shown in Figure S9 J. Compensated data were processed and rendered using FCS Express 7 Research.
Bioinformatics analysis was performed using MSK Bioinformatics core facility services. The output data (FASTQ files) were mapped to human genome (hg19) using the 2-pass mapping method ( Engström et al., 2013 25. Engström, P.G. ∙ Steijger, T. ∙ Sipos, B. ... Systematic evaluation of spliced alignment programs for RNA-seq data Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :1185-1191 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ) with STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 20. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25622) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Gencode v18 annotations. Output SAM files were post-processed using PICARD tool AddOrReplaceReadGroups to add read groups, sort files and convert them to compressed BAM format. The expression count matrix for each feature (exon, PROMPT, eRNA) was computed from the mapped reads using HTSeq v0.5.3 ( Anders et al., 2015 2. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq—a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (13086) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a custom GTF that included Gencode annotations, PROMPT regions from Wu et al. (2020) 89. Wu, G. ∙ Schmid, M. ∙ Rib, L. ... A two-layered targeting mechanism underlies nuclear RNA sorting by the human exosome Cel Rep. 2020; 30 :2387-2401.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar and eRNA regions from ( Andersson et al., 2014 4. Andersson, R. ∙ Gebhard, C. ∙ Miguel-Escalada, I. ... An atlas of active enhancers across human cell types and tissues Nature. 2014; 507 :455-461 Crossref Scopus (1755) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genome coverage normalized to reads per million was computed for each strand using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 20. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25622) PubMed Google Scholar ) in run mode inputAlignmentsFromBAM and output in bedGraph format. Coverage was averaged across replicates in each sample group. Normalized coverage tracks were rendered and compared between samples using Integrative Genomics Viewer ( Robinson et al., 2011 71. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Winckler, W. ... Integrative genomics viewer Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :24-26 Crossref Scopus (9113) PubMed Google Scholar ).
PROMPT regions were converted from GRCh38 to hg19 using UCSC liftOver 9 ( Hinrichs et al., 2006 37. Hinrichs, A.S. ∙ Karolchik, D. ∙ Baertsch, R. ... The UCSC genome browser database: update 2006 Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 :D590-D598 Crossref Scopus (839) PubMed Google Scholar ). Custom R script was used to find all Gencode annotated protein coding and lincRNA transcription start sites (TSS) within 3kb downstream of any PROMPT. If multiple PROMPTs fell within the 3kb downstream region of a single TSS, only the closest one was kept for analysis. The region 3kb upstream and 3kb downstream of these PROMPT-proximal TSSs were saved in BED format. Coverage for these 6kb regions was extracted from bedGraph files of each sample group described above. Finally, Gencode annotated exon regions were converted to BED format and removed from TSS window coverage files using bedtools subtract. Figures were generated using R showing total coverage of all PROMPTs on reverse strand, colored by sample group.
TSSs of eRNA regions were identified as the midpoint between their start and end coordinates and were filtered for those at least 2kb upstream or downstream of any Gencode annotated gene. As previously described, 6kb regions around each TSS were saved in BED format and coverage for these regions was extracted from bedGraph files of each sample group using bedtools intersect. Exon regions were removed using bedtools subtract. Figures were generated using R showing total coverage around eRNA TSSs, separated by transcription direction and colored by sample group.
snRNA transcripts were filtered from Gencode annotations and regions extending from 1kb upstream to 1kb downstream of their 3′ ends were saved in BED format. Coverage for these 2kb regions were extracted from bedGraph files for each sample group using bedtools intersect. Figure was generated using R to show total coverage of all snRNA EAGs, colored by sample group.
Biochemical assays related to Figures 5 A–5L were performed using at least three technical replicates. EMSA ( Figures 5 A, 5E, and 5G) and strand displacement kinetic data ( Figures 5 C, 5I, and 5K) were plotted as mean ± standard deviation using GraphPad Prism. Biological experiments related to Figures 5M-P were performed in three biological replicates while Figures 6 F and 6G in five biological replicates. PROMPT RNA levels from the qPCR assay (Figure 5M) were normalized relative to RNA levels in parental HAP1 cells. Relative pROS1 levels in Figure 6 G were obtained by taking the Alexa Fluor 647 intensity median of each cell population and normalizing against the median of cells expressing GFP-ROS1. The mean and individual normalized data points were plotted along with the standard deviations represented by error bars in the figures. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired two-tailed t test in GraphPad Prism 9. p values are indicated by ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
