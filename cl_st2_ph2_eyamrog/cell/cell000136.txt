Title: Structural Basis of Low-pH-Dependent Lysosomal Cholesterol Egress by NPC1 and NPC2


Abstract: Summary

Lysosomal cholesterol egress requires two proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, whose defects are responsible for Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). Here, we present systematic structural characterizations that reveal the molecular basis for low-pH-dependent cholesterol delivery from NPC2 to the transmembrane (TM) domain of NPC1. At pH 8.0, similar structures of NPC1 were obtained in nanodiscs and in detergent at resolutions of 3.6 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. A tunnel connecting the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the transmembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD) was unveiled. At pH 5.5, the NTD exhibits two conformations, suggesting the motion for cholesterol delivery to the tunnel. A putative cholesterol molecule is found at the membrane boundary of the tunnel, and TM2 moves toward formation of a surface pocket on the SSD. Finally, the structure of the NPC1-NPC2 complex at 4.0 Å resolution was obtained at pH 5.5, elucidating the molecular basis for cholesterol handoff from NPC2 to NPC1(NTD).

Section: Introduction

Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a rare inherited disease, is characterized by defective lysosomal storage of cholesterol and sphingolipids in liver, spleen, and brain cells, leading to clinical phenotypes dominated by hepatosplenomegaly and severely impaired cognitive development ( Chang et al., 2005; Evans and Hendriksz, 2017; Park et al., 2003; Pentchev, 2004; Ribeiro et al., 2001; Vanier and Millat, 2003 6.

While NPC has been historically considered a progressive neurological disorder in children, a recent estimation of prevalence has raised the awareness of late-onset NPC and updated the overall incidence rate to 1/19,000 to 36,000 ( Wassif et al., 2016 61.

Among the identified NPC-related disease mutations, 95% have been found in NPC1, a 1,278-aa membrane protein functioning in the late endosome/lysosome (LE/Ly) ( Carstea et al., 1997; Loftus et al., 1997; Patterson et al., 2012 4.

Storch, J. ∙ Xu, Z. Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) and intracellular cholesterol trafficking Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791 :671-678 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). The two proteins work cooperatively to regulate the egress of endocytosed cholesterol from the LE/Ly ( Goldstein et al., 1975; Kwon et al., 2009; Sleat et al., 2004 18.

USA. 2004; 101 :5886-5891 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ), and loss of function in either protein could result in local cholesterol accumulation ( Vanier, 2015 56. Vanier, M.T. Complex lipid trafficking in Niemann-Pick disease type C J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2015; 38 :187-199 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Facilitated by lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) ( McCauliff et al., 2019 33. McCauliff, L.A. ∙ Langan, A. ∙ Li, R. ... Intracellular cholesterol trafficking is dependent upon NPC2 interaction with lysobisphosphatidic acid eLife. 2019; 8 :e50832 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), NPC2 takes up cholesterol from the intraluminal vesicles in the LE/Ly compartments ( Möbius et al., 2003 34. Möbius, W. ∙ van Donselaar, E. ∙ Ohno-Iwashita, Y. ... Recycling compartments and the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies harbor most of the cholesterol found in the endocytic pathway Traffic. 2003; 4 :222-231 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protein then delivers cholesterol to NPC1 for downstream cross-membrane transport.
Various reports have linked NPC1 to the entry point of viruses. Ebola viral spike glycoprotein (GP) specifically binds to NPC1 after reaching LE/Ly, triggering downstream cellular infection ( Carette et al., 2011; Chandran et al., 2005; Côté et al., 2011 3. Carette, J.E. ∙ Raaben, M. ∙ Wong, A.C. ... Ebola virus entry requires the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 Nature. 2011; 477 :340-343 Crossref Scopus (1007) PubMed Google Scholar 5.

Small molecule inhibitors reveal Niemann-Pick C1 is essential for Ebola virus infection Nature. 2011; 477 :344-348 Crossref Scopus (567) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is also found to rely on the NPC1-mediated intracellular cholesterol trafficking pathway ( Tang et al., 2009 55. Tang, Y. ∙ Leao, I.C. ∙ Coleman, E.M. ... Deficiency of niemann-pick type C-1 protein impairs release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and results in Gag accumulation in late endosomal/lysosomal compartments J. Virol. 2009; 83 :7982-7995 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, structural elucidation of NPC1/NPC2-mediated lysosomal cholesterol transport will not only lay the grounds for NPC disease treatments but also clarify the intracellular trafficking of endogenous and exogenous cargos ( Pfeffer, 2019 43. Pfeffer, S.R. NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1)-mediated cholesterol export from lysosomes J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :1706-1709 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ).
NPC1 comprises 3 lumenal domains—the amino-terminal domain (NTD), domain C (also known as the middle lumenal domain [MLD]), and domain I (also known as the CTD)—and 13 transmembrane (TM) passes ( Davies and Ioannou, 2000 9. Davies, J.P. ∙ Ioannou, Y.A. Topological analysis of Niemann-Pick C1 protein reveals that the membrane orientation of the putative sterol-sensing domain is identical to those of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :24367-24374 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among these, NTD has been demonstrated, and the transmembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD) has been suggested, to bind cholesterol or sterol analogs ( Infante et al., 2008a; Lu et al., 2015; Ohgami et al., 2004 24.

USA. 2004; 101 :12473-12478 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). The crystal structure of NPC2 shows that the hydrocarbon tail of cholesterol inserts deep into the binding pocket, exposing only the hydroxyl group to the lysosomal lumen ( Xu et al., 2007 64. Xu, S. ∙ Benoff, B. ∙ Liou, H.-L. ... Structural basis of sterol binding by NPC2, a lysosomal protein deficient in Niemann-Pick type C2 disease J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :23525-23531 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a sense, cholesterol is “solubilized” for handover to NPC1(NTD), which binds cholesterol from the hydroxyl group, a binding fashion complementary to that of NPC2 ( Kwon et al., 2009 27. Kwon, H.J. ∙ Abi-Mosleh, L. ∙ Wang, M.L. ... Structure of N-terminal domain of NPC1 reveals distinct subdomains for binding and transfer of cholesterol Cell. 2009; 137 :1213-1224 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A “hydrophobic handoff” model has been proposed, in which NPC2 is likely to conjugate with NPC1(NTD) to relay the cholesterol ( Kwon et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010 27. Kwon, H.J. ∙ Abi-Mosleh, L. ∙ Wang, M.L. ... Structure of N-terminal domain of NPC1 reveals distinct subdomains for binding and transfer of cholesterol Cell. 2009; 137 :1213-1224 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar 59.

Identification of surface residues on Niemann-Pick C2 essential for hydrophobic handoff of cholesterol to NPC1 in lysosomes Cell Metab. 2010; 12 :166-173 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compelling evidence from in vitro and in vivo assays has inspired several in silico attempts to simulate the interface of NPC2-NPC1(NTD) ( Estiu et al., 2013; Hodošček and Elghobashi-Meinhardt, 2018 14. Estiu, G. ∙ Khatri, N. ∙ Wiest, O. Computational studies of the cholesterol transport between NPC2 and the N-terminal domain of NPC1 (NPC1(NTD)) Biochemistry. 2013; 52 :6879-6891 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar 23. Hodošček, M. ∙ Elghobashi-Meinhardt, N. Simulations of NPC1(NTD):NPC2 Protein Complex Reveal Cholesterol Transfer Pathways Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19 :2623 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ). An elevated collision frequency of the two, however, must rely on other participants as the binding affinity was barely detectable ( Gong et al., 2016 19. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Zhou, X. ... Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection Cell. 2016; 165 :1467-1478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Domain C was shown to bind NPC2 at acidic pH ( Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011 10. Deffieu, M.S. ∙ Pfeffer, S.R. Niemann-Pick type C 1 function requires lumenal domain residues that mediate cholesterol-dependent NPC2 binding Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :18932-18936 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). A low pH also facilitates cholesterol binding to NPC2 and the ensuing cholesterol delivery, consistent with the acidic environment of the lysosome lumen ( Cheruku et al., 2006; Friedland et al., 2003; Infante et al., 2008b 7. Cheruku, S.R. ∙ Xu, Z. ∙ Dutia, R. ... Mechanism of cholesterol transfer from the Niemann-Pick type C2 protein to model membranes supports a role in lysosomal cholesterol transport J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :15287-15292 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length (FL) NPC1 reveals that the NTD, connected to the first TM through a polyproline linker, sits atop the two pseudo-symmetric lumenal domains C and I ( Gong et al., 2016 19. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Zhou, X. ... Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection Cell. 2016; 165 :1467-1478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Past observations suggest that NPC2 is anchored to domain C and then transfers cholesterol to the NTD through a hydrophobic interface ( Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011; Gong et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2010 10. Deffieu, M.S. ∙ Pfeffer, S.R. Niemann-Pick type C 1 function requires lumenal domain residues that mediate cholesterol-dependent NPC2 binding Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Identification of surface residues on Niemann-Pick C2 essential for hydrophobic handoff of cholesterol to NPC1 in lysosomes Cell Metab. 2010; 12 :166-173 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, no structure of this transfer process has been captured. Questions were also raised on the subsequent path of cholesterol in NPC1. Is there an internal tunnel in NPC1, as the one in the related signaling protein Patched1 (Ptch1) or its yeast counterpart NCR1 ( Gong et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2019; Winkler et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018 20.

Structural Basis for Cholesterol Transport-like Activity of the Hedgehog Receptor Patched Cell. 2018; 175 :1352-1364 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ), or does the NTD traverse the glycocalyx layer to deliver cholesterol to the membrane ( Gong et al., 2016 19. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Zhou, X. ... Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection Cell. 2016; 165 :1467-1478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar )? Further downstream, how does the SSD interact with cholesterol? To address these questions, we carried out systematic structural characterizations of human NPC1 and the interactions between NPC1 and NPC2. Our results also unveil the molecular basis for the requirement of low pH during NPC1-mediated cholesterol egress.

Section: Results

Mechanistic investigation requires accurate structures. Our previous cryo-EM structure of FL-NPC1 at pH 8.0 was determined to 4.4 Å resolution ( Gong et al., 2016 19. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Zhou, X. ... Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection Cell. 2016; 165 :1467-1478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), which did not permit a detailed analysis. X-ray crystallography only yielded the structure of NPC1 without the NTD and the first TM ( Li et al., 2017 29. Li, X. ∙ Lu, F. ∙ Trinh, M.N. ... 3.3 Å structure of Niemann-Pick C1 protein reveals insights into the function of the C-terminal luminal domain in cholesterol transport Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :9116-9121 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, no cholesterol-like density is found on the surface of the SSD, as seen in Ptch1 ( Gong et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2018b; Zhang et al., 2018 20. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Cao, P. ...

Structural Basis for Cholesterol Transport-like Activity of the Hedgehog Receptor Patched Cell. 2018; 175 :1352-1364 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ), in any NPC1 structures. Reasoning that the lack of cholesterol binding may result from competition of detergent molecules, we sought to solve the structure of NPC1 embedded in nanodiscs, with other conditions unchanged.
Details for nanodisc reconstitution and cryo-EM analysis can be found in the STAR Methods and Figure S1 . The structure of NPC1 in nanodiscs at pH 8.0 was determined at 3.6 Å resolution ( Figures 1 A and S1 ; Table 1 ). When both low-pass filtered to 4.4 Å, the only difference between this map and the previous one in digitonin ( Gong et al., 2016 19. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Zhou, X. ... Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection Cell. 2016; 165 :1467-1478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ) is a small density on the SSD surface in the presence of digitonin, but not in nanodiscs ( Figure S1 G, inset).
Excluding the interference of detergent with cholesterol binding to SSD, we shifted our focus to high-resolution structural determination of NPC1 in detergent, whose sample preparation is less time-consuming. Following a similar protocol ( Gong et al., 2016 19. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Zhou, X. ... Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection Cell. 2016; 165 :1467-1478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), but replacing digitonin with glycol-diosgenin (GDN) for protein purification, we obtained a 3D EM reconstruction of NPC1 purified at pH 8.0 at an overall resolution of 3.0 Å ( Figures 1 B, S2 , and S3 ; Table 1 ).
The transmembrane domain (TMD) and domains C and I are well-resolved, while the NTD is of a lower resolution at ∼4 Å ( Figure 1 B, left). Because recent structures of Ptch1 and previously reported resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily proteins, like AcrB and MexB, all contain similar TMD fold corresponding to the last 12 TM segments of NPC1 ( Delmar et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2018b; Venter et al., 2015; Yamaguchi et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018 12.

Structural Basis for Cholesterol Transport-like Activity of the Hedgehog Receptor Patched Cell. 2018; 175 :1352-1364 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ), we propose to rename the first TM from TM1 to TM0. Thus, the remaining 12 TMs, with a 2-fold symmetry, would have the same numbering system with other RND proteins. Hereafter, our description of NPC1 will conform to this numbering system.
As already shown, TMs 2–6 constitute the SSD, and TMs 8–12 form the SSD-like domain (SSDL). TMs 1–6 and domain C, which is between TM1 and TM2 in primary sequence, constitute one repeat that is related to the other, consisting of TMs 7–12 and domain I, by ∼180° rotation around an axis parallel to membrane norm ( Figure 1 B). The improved resolution reveals a stretch of density in the NTD pocket that overlaps with the bound cholesterol when the structure of NTD is docked, although no cholesterol or cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) was added during protein preparation ( Figure S3 B). When the high-resolution structure of NPC1 is superimposed to that in nanodiscs, the TM domain remains nearly identical, while domain C moves slightly toward domain I ( Figures 1 C and S2 E).
The excellent map of FL human NPC1 supports reliable structural analysis and enables mapping of 218 residues whose mutations have been identified in NPC patients ( Figures 2 A and S3 A; Table S1 ). Most mutations may belong to two categories, structural mutations and functional mutations ( Table S1 ). The former, exemplified by I1061T ( Gelsthorpe et al., 2008; Nakasone et al., 2014 17. Gelsthorpe, M.E. ∙ Baumann, N. ∙ Millard, E. ...

Such mutations may compromise protein stability, thus affecting both cellular trafficking and transport activity, a speculation to be tested by systematic biochemical and cellular characterizations. In the following, we will focus on the functional mutations that may directly interfere with cholesterol transport. To facilitate understanding of their structure-function relationship, the disease-related residues are labeled dark red in all figures.

The lumenal end of the tunnel opens to the NTD and the rest transverses through the interface between domains C and I, all the way down to the membrane-facing surface of the SSD constituted by TMs 2–4.

USA. 2004; 101 :12473-12478 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ), sits at the bottom of the tunnel ( Figure 2 B, inset). Based on the architectural similarity with Ptch1 and NCR1, this tunnel may represent the cholesterol transport path from the NTD to the membrane. However, the tunnel in NPC1 at pH 8.0 is empty, in contrast to the sterol-loaded tunnel in Ptch1 or NCR1.
The improved resolution shows that the NTD mainly interacts with the other two lumenal domains through polar interactions. A few disease-related residues, such as Gln92 in the NTD, Arg518 in domain C, and Arg978 in domain I, may participate in inter-domain contacts ( Figure 2 C). However, the gate of the NTD pocket is turning away from the entrance to the central tunnel in the present structure, suggesting a state that is not primed for cholesterol relay to downstream site ( Figure 2 C).
A close examination of the tunnel reveals a bewildering feature. Despite the highly hydrophobic nature of cholesterol, the lumenal entrance to the tunnel is amphiphilic. Several charged and polar residues, including Ser940/Asp944/Asp945/Asp948/Lys1013/Tyr1019 on domain I, are clustered on one side of the entrance, while the other side is lined with hydrophobic residues from both domains ( Figure 2 D). The charges or polar groups carried by these residues are essential for the function of NPC1, as neutralizing mutations S940L, D944N, D945N, and D948N have been found in NPC patients, and so is Y1019C ( Table S1 ).
To examine the functional significance of representative tunnel-lining residues, we conducted a cell-based assay to examine the ability of various NPC1 mutants to rescue lysosomal cholesterol egress in NPC1-deficient CHO cells ( Figures S4, S5, and S6 ). Because some mutations may compromise cellular trafficking of NPC1, we hereby only discuss the mutants that can reach the LE/Ly if not otherwise indicated ( Figures 2 E, S4 , S5 , and S6 ). D944N completely failed to rescue cholesterol egress, similar to the classical mutation P691S. Although D948N was suggested to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as judged by Endo H sensitivity ( Wang et al., 2019 60. Wang, C. ∙ Scott, S.M. ∙ Subramanian, K. ... Quantitating the epigenetic transformation contributing to cholesterol homeostasis using Gaussian process Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5052 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), our colocalization analysis showed that there is little difference between D948N and WT NPC1 ( Figure S6 A), indicating a near normal trafficking of this mutant in our assays. It rescued the NPC-deficient cells for over 80% ( Figure 2 E). Nevertheless, the structure in its current conformation cannot afford a plausible explanation for the functional significance of Asp944.
Below the amphiphilic entrance, the tunnel is largely hydrophobic before reaching the “neck” region, which we define as the segments that connect the lumenal domains to the TMD. The neck region consists of extended segments, including linker 1 between TM1 and helix Cα1 (the first helix in domain C), neck helix 2 (the helix preceding TM2), and the corresponding linker 7 and neck helix 8 in domain I ( Figures 2 A and 2B, inset). A number of residues that line the middle-segment of the tunnel are disease-related ( Figure 2 F). In particular, all four residues that define the contour of the tunnel at the neck region, Ile609/Gln862/Phe1087/Tyr1088, are NPC-associated ( Figure 2 F, right; Table 1 ). In our functional assay, Q862A restored ∼90% NPC1 activity, while I609T and F1087L lost approximately 30% and 50% of the activities ( Figures 2 E, S5 , and S6 B).
Close to the SSD site, the tunnel becomes amphiphilic again. In addition to a large number of hydrophobic residues, Ser617/Asp620/Glu688 on TM2 and TM4 appear to set an energy barrier for cholesterol access to the SSD from the tunnel ( Figure 2 G). This site must be delicately arranged, as E688Q lost 30% activities and mutation of a nearby hydrophobic residue on TM4, I685T, led to about half loss of function ( Figures 2 E, 2G, S4 , S5 , and S6 ).
The structure reveals a seemingly conductive tunnel between the NTD and SSD. However, the conformations of the NTD and the neck region may not represent an active state for cholesterol transfer from the NTD. Considering that low pH is a prerequisite for NPC1 and NPC2 function, we then sought to determine the structure of NPC1 and its complex with NPC2 at lower pH.
Details of the EM reconstructions of NPC1 at pH 5.5 (designated NPC1-5.5) are illustrated in the STAR Methods and Figure S7 . Unlike in the aforementioned structure at pH 8.0 (designated NPC1-8.0), for which only one class can be obtained during 3D classification ( Figure S2 ), the NTD exhibits multiple conformations for NPC1-5.5 and two distinct positions were resolved ( Figure 3 A; Video S1 ). In one structure, named NPC1-5.5a at an overall resolution of 3.7 Å, the NTD adopts a similar position to that in NPC1-8.0, while in the other, NPC1-5.5b at 3.9 Å, the NTD rotates toward the downstream domains. As a result of the NTD motion, the gate of the cholesterol-binding pocket is reoriented closer to the upper entry of the central tunnel ( Figure 3 A; Video S1 ). This motion may represent a transitioning process for cholesterol transfer from the NTD to the lumenal tunnel.

NTD Motion in NPC1 at pH 5.5, Related to Figure 3 The morph was generated with structures of NPC1-5.5a and NPC1-5.5b as the first and end frames.
Although the moderate resolution of the NTD at pH 5.5 does not allow an accurate analysis of the interface ( Figure S8 ), structural docking suggests that the interface between the NTD and domains C and I is rearranged with increased contact area with domain I in NPC1-5.5b. The highly polar surface of the NTD, composed by its helices α1 and α2, is engaged in the interaction with the charged residue-enriched helix Iα5 in domain I. The charges that guard the entrance to the central tunnel provided by Asp944/Asp948/Lys951 are likely neutralized as the NTD changes orientation ( Figures 2 D and 3 B). Arg96 in helix α2 of the NTD may interact with Asp944 and Asp948.
This structural observation predicts that proper docking of the NTD on domain I, mediated primarily by polar and charged residues, is important for orienting the NTD pocket and the lumenal opening of the central tunnel during cholesterol transfer. Supporting this prediction, Ala substitution of Arg96 results in ∼70% reduced ability to rescue NPC1-deficient cells. As already mentioned, D944N leads to nearly complete loss of activity, whereas D948N can largely rescue the activity ( Figures S4, S5, and S6 ). Therefore, Arg96 and Asp944 play a critical role in cholesterol transfer, likely by orienting the NTD for cholesterol delivery to the central tunnel. Currently the two gates are not aligned in the structure of NPC1-5.5b and, thus, the NTD, as well as domains C/I, should undergo further shifts for cholesterol transfer.
Apart from the NTD, all other domains remain identical in the two classes of NPC1-5.5. However, pronounced overall structural shifts are observed relative to NPC1-8.0 ( Figure 4 A; Video S2 ). Domain-wise comparison shows that the C-half repeat containing domain I and TMs 7-12 remains nearly unchanged with the root-mean-standard deviation (RMSD) of 1.02 Å over 396 Cα atoms ( Figure 4 B, left). When the N-half repeats consisting of domain C and TMs 1–6 are compared, local shifts are evident with the RMSD of 1.72 Å over 446 Cα atoms ( Figure 4 B, right). Further comparison shows that SSDL is relatively stable, with RMSD of 0.83 Å over 172 Cα atoms between the NPC1-5.5a and NPC1-8.0, while the RMSD for SSD increases to 0.89 Å over only 149 Cα atoms. The most prominent deviation occurs to TM2 and the preceding neck helix 2 ( Figure 4 C).

Conformational Changes of NPC1 between pH 8.0 and pH 5.5, Related to Figure 4 The morph was generated using structures of NPC1-8.0 and NPC1-5.5a as the first and end frames.
Accompanying the conformational changes, a density that resembles a cholesterol molecule is found in the neck region of NPC1-5.5, but not in the corresponding position of NPC1-8.0 ( Figure 4 D). The decent resolution at the neck region of both NPC1-5.5 and NPC1-8.0 can support a detailed analysis of the conformational rearrangements. The most conspicuous motion occurs at one side of the interface between the SSD and SSDL, particularly between TM2/TM4 and TM11/TM12 and the neck region that is enriched of polar residues ( Figure 4 E). At pH 8.0, an extensive hydrogen bond (H-bond) network is formed between Glu612 and Ser870, Arg615 and Asp869, Glu616 and Ser1218, and finally Gln1219 and Asp868. In addition, Phe692 is stacked with Tyr1229 via π-π interaction, which may be reinforced by Lys1206 below ( Figure 4 E, left). At pH 5.5, however, only the salt bridge between Arg615 and Asp869 is preserved. None of the other interactions, including the π-π interaction between TM4 and TM12, are observed ( Figure 4 E, right).
This rearrangement is reminiscent of the conformational changes between wild-type (WT) Ptch1 and a variant Ptch1-3M, the latter deprived of sterol binding ability due to three mutations L282Q/T500F/P504L ( Gong et al., 2018 20. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Cao, P. ... Structural basis for the recognition of Sonic Hedgehog by human Patched1 Science. 2018; 361 :361 Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar ). Pro504 in human Ptch1 corresponds to Pro691 in NPC1. Compared to Ptch1-3M, TM2, neck helix 2, and TM11 move concertedly toward TM3, resulting in a narrower and deeper surface pocket that accommodates a sterol-like ligand in WT Ptch1 ( Figure 4 F). Indeed, when the TM domains of NPC1 and the Ptch1 variants are compared, the overall SSD and SSDL domains of NPC1-5.5 can be well superimposed to those in Ptch1-3M ( Figure 4 G, left), but they deviate from WT Ptch1 at the TM2 region ( Figure 4 G, middle). Structural comparison of NPC1-8.0, NPC1-5.5, and WT Ptch1 reveals a concerted motion of TM11, neck helix 2, and TM2 ( Figure 4 G, right). This may explain the lack of sterol binding to the SSD in all NPC1 structures because further shift of TM2 toward TM3 may be required to form a productive sterol binding site. While a condition is yet to be figured out for an “active” conformation of NPC1-SSD, we attempted to resolve the structure of NPC1-NPC2 complex in the hope of elucidating more conformations.
A stable complex between NPC1 and NPC2 can be obtained at lower pH, such as pH 5.5. After standard image acquisition and data processing, 101,364 selected particles yielded a map at an overall resolution of 4.0 Å ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S9 ). The local resolution for NPC2 and NPC1(NTD) is lower than the other regions, but sufficient for structural docking ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the NPC2-domain C complex ( Li et al., 2016 28. Li, X. ∙ Saha, P. ∙ Li, J. ... Clues to the mechanism of cholesterol transfer from the structure of NPC1 middle lumenal domain bound to NPC2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :10079-10084 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ), NPC2 binds to the hydrophobic loops 1 and 2 of domain C, leaving its cholesterol binding pocket open to that of NPC1(NTD) ( Figure 5 C). Other than NPC2, the overall structure of NPC1 in the complex is nearly identical to that of NPC1-5.5a ( Figure S10 A). When the crystal structure of NPC2-domain C complex is superimposed to our complex structure against domain C, NPC2 shows an ∼25° rotation centered at loop 1 and toward NTD ( Figure 5 D).
Despite the moderate resolutions of NPC2 and NTD in the complex, two sterol densities are still discernible in the pockets, lining up a putative path for cholesterol channeling with the cholesterol binding pockets of both proteins forming a tunnel concaving upward ( Figures 5 E and 5F). As no external sterol was added during protein purification or sample preparation, these densities likely result from endogenous molecules.
The pocket openings in NPC2 and NPC1(NTD) are not conjugated and the distance between the two bound cholesterol molecules appears above 10 Å ( Figure 5 F). Most of the previously identified residues key to cholesterol transfer ( Kwon et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010 27. Kwon, H.J. ∙ Abi-Mosleh, L. ∙ Wang, M.L. ... Structure of N-terminal domain of NPC1 reveals distinct subdomains for binding and transfer of cholesterol Cell. 2009; 137 :1213-1224 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar 59. Wang, M.L. ∙ Motamed, M. ∙ Infante, R.E. ... Identification of surface residues on Niemann-Pick C2 essential for hydrophobic handoff of cholesterol to NPC1 in lysosomes Cell Metab. 2010; 12 :166-173 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ) face each other in the complex structure, but there is a substantial gap between the characterized surface patches ( Figure 5 G). Additional bending and rotation of NPC2, and/or concerted movement of NPC1(NTD), is needed for a fully chaperoned cholesterol transfer ( Figure 5 H). Our map is, thus, likely to represent an intermediate position of a transient pulling exerted on NPC2.
Similar to the maps of NPC1-5.5, a sterol-like density is also seen at the neck region. Despite the overall lowered resolution, the sterol density is better resolved in the complex than that in NPC1-5.5 ( Figures 5 I and S8 B). We therefore focus on the complex for the analysis of sterol binding at this site, which is nearly unchanged compared to the lone NPC1 at pH 5.5 ( Figures 5 J and 5K).
The density is at the boundary between the neck region and the TMD, with the bulk density mainly surrounded by the neck helices 2 and 8. Hydrophobic residues from the neck helices, linker 1 that connects TM1 and domain C, TM5, and the loop between TMs 3/4, together contour the binding site. A potential H-bond is formed between Gln862 and the 3β-OH of cholesterol, although the NPC1 mutant Q862A can still rescue cholesterol egress ( Figures 2 E, S5 , and S6 B). Among the coordinating residues, mutations L380F, Q862L, F1087L, and Y1088C have been associated with NPC ( Table S1 ). Moreover, our rescue experiments indicate that I685T, V689T, F1087L and I1220T lost approximately half of the rescue effect, and I609T compromised NPC1 activity. Trp381 exhibits a close contact with the cholesterol density, whose mutation (W381L) led to ∼70% loss of the ability to rescue the deficient cells ( Figures S5 and S6 B). All of the mutants reached the LE/Ly in our assays, except that V689T showed reduced colocalization with LAMP1 ( Figures S4 and S6 A).

Section: Discussion

The structures of NPC1 under different conditions and the NPC1/2 complex afford important insight to the understanding of the function and disease mechanism of NPC1/2. The requirement of low pH for NPC2 function and its interaction with domain C has been extensively studied ( Cheruku et al., 2006; Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011 7. Cheruku, S.R. ∙ Xu, Z. ∙ Dutia, R. ... Mechanism of cholesterol transfer from the Niemann-Pick type C2 protein to model membranes supports a role in lysosomal cholesterol transport J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :31594-31604 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar 10. Deffieu, M.S. ∙ Pfeffer, S.R. Niemann-Pick type C 1 function requires lumenal domain residues that mediate cholesterol-dependent NPC2 binding Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :18932-18936 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results presented here explain how the native low pH environment of lysosomal lumen is required for cholesterol to travel through NPC1 and reach the membrane. New hypotheses are also derived to be tested in the future.
Together, previous studies and our current structural studies suggest a “K-turn” trajectory for cholesterol delivery. Much resembling a “K-turn” for steering a vehicle, cholesterol first binds NPC2 exposing its hydroxyl end, “reverses” into NPC1(NTD), and eventually enters the central tunnel with the hydrophobic side facing the membrane ( Figure 6 A).
The crystal structures of cholesterol-bound NPC2 and NPC1(NTD), and NCR1 with a sterol in the tunnel, along with the cryo-EM structures of NPC1-5.5a, NPC1-NPC2 complex, and the sterol-aligned Ptch1, have largely revealed the route of cholesterol delivery from NPC2 to the SSD ( Figure 6 B). Of particular note, three sterol-like densities are found in Ptch1, one in the lumenal tunnel, one at the neck site, and one in the SSD, even at pH 8.0 ( Figures 6 B and S10 B) ( Gong et al., 2018 20. Gong, X. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Cao, P. ... Structural basis for the recognition of Sonic Hedgehog by human Patched1 Science. 2018; 361 :361 Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar ). In contrast, the tunnel and SSD in NPC1 are empty at pH 8.0, suggesting mechanistic differences between NPC1 and Ptch1.
The key to completing the K-turn delivery resides in the flexibility of the NTD, which is essential for reorienting the cargo. Data processing of NPC1 purified at pH 8.0 and 5.5 suggests that NTD is more flexible at pH 5.5, because multiple conformations are observed with two distinct states resolved. Therefore, in addition to the known low-pH-facilitated cholesterol binding to NPC2 and NPC1-NPC2 interaction ( Friedland et al., 2003; Infante et al., 2008b 16. Friedland, N. ∙ Liou, H.L. ∙ Lobel, P. ... Structure of a cholesterol-binding protein deficient in Niemann-Pick type C2 disease Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :2512-2517 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar 25. Infante, R.E. ∙ Wang, M.L. ∙ Radhakrishnan, A. ... NPC2 facilitates bidirectional transfer of cholesterol between NPC1 and lipid bilayers, a step in cholesterol egress from lysosomes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :15287-15292 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ), the ensuing cholesterol transfer from the NTD to the central tunnel also requires a low-pH environment.
The SSD has been predicted to bind cholesterol ( Lu et al., 2015; Ohgami et al., 2004; Head et al., 2017 22. Head, S.A. ∙ Shi, W.Q. ∙ Yang, E.J. ... Simultaneous Targeting of NPC1 and VDAC1 by Itraconazole Leads to Synergistic Inhibition of mTOR Signaling and Angiogenesis ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12 :174-182 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Lu, F. ∙ Liang, Q. ∙ Abi-Mosleh, L. ... Identification of NPC1 as the target of U18666A, an inhibitor of lysosomal cholesterol export and Ebola infection eLife. 2015; 4 :e12177 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Ohgami, N. ∙ Ko, D.C. ∙ Thomas, M. ... Binding between the Niemann-Pick C1 protein and a photoactivatable cholesterol analog requires a functional sterol-sensing domain Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :12473-12478 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). None of the NPC1 or NCR1 structures bear a sterol bound to the SSD. Structural comparison of NPC1 at distinct pH conditions, and with sterol-bound Ptch1, suggests that formation of the SSD sterol binding site may also require low pH. As shown in Figure 4 G, although neither NPC1-5.5 nor NPC1-8.0 has an active SSD conformation for sterol binding, NPC1-5.5, with its TM2 moving toward the pocket, is closer to the sterol-bound conformation in Ptch1. Further displacement following this tendency may become compatible with cholesterol binding. Alternatively, cholesterol may need to travel in proximity to induce such displacement.
In addition, a cholesterol is trapped at the neck site of NPC1-5.5, but not NPC1-8.0, in which the neck site is wide open to the SSD. Such differences can only result from pH change, given that all other conditions were identical for cryo-sample preparation. What triggers pH-dependent conformational changes?
As analyzed in Figure 4 E, the interface between the two repeats, especially between TM4 and TM12, is mediated by several polar interactions at pH 8.0, but most of these contacts are broken at pH 5.5. It is as expected that the salt bridge between a carboxylate (Asp869) and a guanidinium group (Arg615) is not affected by the pH change from 5.5 to 8.0. In contrast, the H-bonds between a carboxyl group and a weak proton donor, such as the hydroxyl group in Ser and the amine in Gln, are broken at pH 5.5, upon protonation. Together, these three pairs, Glu612-Ser870, Glu616-Ser1218, and Gln1219-Asp868, appear to be the pH sensor responsible for the conformational differences at TM2 and surrounding regions ( Figure 4 E). A triple mutation S870A/S1218A/Q1219A led to loss of function in the cellular rescue assay, and even a single point mutation S870A can nearly abolish NPC1 activity ( Figures S4, S5 , and S6 ). However, the interpretation is complicated by their reduced co-localization with LAMP-1 ( Figure S6 A). The molecular determinant for pH sensing, consequently, awaits further investigation.
Note that NPC1 and its mutants were overexpressed in our cell-based assays because it is not practical to make genomic substitutions for the large number of mutants. Results for some of the mutants from the cell-based assays require further investigation. For instance, Q862A showed near normal activity in our assays, which may be a result of overexpression. D948N, reported previously to be retained in the ER ( Wang et al., 2019 60. Wang, C. ∙ Scott, S.M. ∙ Subramanian, K. ... Quantitating the epigenetic transformation contributing to cholesterol homeostasis using Gaussian process Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5052 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), reached LE/Ly in our assays. These discrepancies may be owing to the difference between the assays we each employed, key factors including codon optimization, levels of expression, methods of qualification/quantification, and the cell lines used.
Because of the structural similarity with the RND family proton co-transporter AcrB and the conservation of key proton-coupling residues, such as Asp700 on TM4 and Glu1166 and His1170 on TM10 ( Figure S11 ), NPC1 has been purported to be a H + -driven secondary transporter. Supporting this notion, inhibition of the vacuolar H + pump led to an NCR1-deficient phenotype ( Winkler et al., 2019 63. Winkler, M.B.L. ∙ Kidmose, R.T. ∙ Szomek, M. ... Structural Insight into Eukaryotic Sterol Transport through Niemann-Pick Type C Proteins Cell. 2019; 179 :485-497 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, neutralization of the three residues, D700N, E1166Q, or H1170F, also resulted in loss of half of the rescuing ability in our cell-based assay despite near normal localization of E1166Q and H1170F and slightly compromised trafficking by D700N to LE/Ly ( Figures S4, S5 , and S6 ). If NPC1 is a H + co-transporter, the structure at pH 8.0 may represent a deprotonated and cholesterol-released state, an analysis supported by the lack of cholesterol density in the tunnel. The cholesterol at the neck site of NPC1-5.5 and the NPC1-NPC2 complex may represent a trapped state due to the lack of an active SSD binding site.
However, there is no direct evidence to demonstrate H + -coupling activity of NPC1. It is noted that the position of the cholesterol in Ptch1 neck site is a half-molecule higher than that in NPC1, which may represent a conductive state at pH 8.0 ( Figure 4 G, middle). The residues corresponding to Asp700/Glu1166/His1170 are all conserved in Ptch1 ( Figure S11 ). Mutations of the residues equivalent to Asp700 and Glu1166 also impeded its activity, although Ptch1 was suggested to rely on extracellular Na + for its activity ( Myers et al., 2017 35. Myers, B.R. ∙ Neahring, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Rapid, direct activity assays for Smoothened reveal Hedgehog pathway regulation by membrane cholesterol and extracellular sodium Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E11141-E11150 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the postulate of NPC1 as a H + -coupled transporter is not fully endorsed.
An alternative explanation is that NPC1 requires low pH for its transport activity. The protein not only exists on the limiting membrane of the LE/Ly, but also the ER and Golgi during its normal progression from site of synthesis through maturation in the secretory pathway, the lumens of which are not acidic ( Gelsthorpe et al., 2008; Watari et al., 2000 17. Gelsthorpe, M.E. ∙ Baumann, N. ∙ Millard, E. ... Niemann-Pick type C1 I1061T mutant encodes a functional protein that is selected for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation due to protein misfolding J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :8229-8236 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Watari, H. ∙ Blanchette-Mackie, E.J. ∙ Dwyer, N.K. ... NPC1-containing compartment of human granulosa-lutein cells: a role in the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol supporting steroidogenesis Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255 :56-66 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). A low-pH dependency may serve as a secure bolt to ensure that neither NPC1 nor NPC2 is aberrantly activated in other organelles and as a means to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. In such a situation, NPC1-8.0 and NPC1-5.5 may represent an inactive and a partially active state, respectively.
Despite the outstanding puzzles, our systematic structural analysis and functional validation presented here reveal the molecular basis for low-pH dependency of cholesterol delivery through NPC1, establish a framework for structure-function relationship study of the hundreds of NPC disease mutants, and, thus, represent a major step forward in the mechanistic understanding of NPC1/2-mediated cholesterol egress from the lysosome, an essential physiological process. We hope this endeavor will contribute to the therapeutic development for NPC.

Atomic coordinates of NPC1-nanodisc, NPC1-8.0, NPC1-5.5a, NPC1-5.5b, and NPC1-NPC2 complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( http://www.rcsb.org ) under the accession codes PDB: 6W5R , 6W5S , 6W5T , 6W5U , and 6W5V , respectively. The corresponding electron microscopy maps have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/ ), under the accession codes EMDB: EMD-21545, EMD-21546, EMD-21547, EMD-21548, and EMD-21549, respectively.
All E. coli cells were cultured in LB medium (Sigma) at 37°C. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used to express the membrane scaffold protein, MSP1E3D1, and strains Top10 and DH5α were used to generate and amplify plasmids for NPC1 variants, respectively.
HEK293F suspension cells were cultured in Freestyle 293 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C supplied with 5% CO 2 and 80% humidity.
HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC HTB-22; Rockville, MD). NPC1-deficient Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (2-2) were kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Brown from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia ( Kristiana et al., 2008 26. Kristiana, I. ∙ Yang, H. ∙ Brown, A.J. Different kinetics of cholesterol delivery to components of the cholesterol homeostatic machinery: implications for cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781 :724-730 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cell culture media included Medium A: Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/Ham’s Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (P/S) for NPC1-deficient CHO cells, and Medium B: DMEM supplemented with 10% and P/S for HeLa. Cells were pre-treated with Mycoplasma Removal Agent (Bio-Rad) and grown as a monolayer at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Plasmid transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. A total of two micrograms of cDNA were used to transfect one well of sub-confluent cells in 6-well plates.
The cDNA of human NPC1 (Uniprot: Q15118 ) and human NPC2 (Uniprot: P61916 ) were cloned into the pCAG vector with a FLAG tag and a His 10 tag at C-terminal. For expression, HEK293F cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids and polyethylenimines (PEIs) (Polysciences) when the cell density reached 2.0 × 10 6 cells per mL. Approximately 1 mg plasmids were pre-mixed with 3 mg PEIs in 50 mL fresh medium for 15-30 min before application. The mixture was then added to 1 L cell culture and incubated without shaking for 15-30 min. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h.
To purify NPC1 in detergent, the cells were harvested through 10-min centrifugation at 3,600 g. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and Amresco protease inhibitor cocktails). After sonication on ice, the membrane fraction was solubilized at 4°C for 2 hours with 1% (w/v) GDN (Anatrace). After centrifugation at 20,000 g for 1 h, the supernatant was collected and applied to anti-Flag M2 affinity resin (MilliporeSigma). The resin was rinsed with the wash buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% GDN. The protein was eluted with the wash buffer plus 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluate was then concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, Superose® 6 Increase, 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in the buffer containing 25 mM MES pH 5.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% GDN. The peak fractions were collected and concentrated to 20 mg/mL for either sample preparation of lone NPC1 or incubation with NPC2. The protein for FL NPC1 at pH 8.0 was purified following the same procedure but using buffer at pH 8.0 (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% GDN) for SEC.
NPC1-nanodiscs were reconstituted following a previously reported protocol with some minor modifications ( Shirzad-Wasei et al., 2015 51. Shirzad-Wasei, N. ∙ van Oostrum, J. ∙ Bovee-Geurts, P.H. ... Rapid transfer of overexpressed integral membrane protein from the host membrane into soluble lipid nanodiscs without previous purification Biol. Chem. 2015; 396 :903-915 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Membrane scaffold protein MSP1E3D1 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified through Ni-NTA resin and Source 15Q ( Ritchie et al., 2009 48. Ritchie, T.K. ∙ Grinkova, Y.V. ∙ Bayburt, T.H. ... Chapter 11 - Reconstitution of membrane proteins in phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs Methods Enzymol. 2009; 464 :211-231 Crossref Scopus (649) PubMed Google Scholar ). After sonication and extraction with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM), the lysate of one-liter HEK293F cells expressing NPC1 was centrifuged at a low speed (2,500 g) to remove the insoluble content. Asolectin (MilliporeSigma) (60 mg) and MSP1E3D1 (100 mg) were then added to the supernatant. The mixture was allowed to incubate at 4°C for 1 h before the addition of detergent absorbents (Bio-Beads® SM-2, Bio-Rad). After overnight incubation, the solution was subject to affinity chromatography and SEC as previously described. Buffers were kept at pH 8.0 (25 mM Tris 8.0, 150 mM NaCl without detergent) throughout. The peak fractions were concentrated to about 13 mg/ml for sample preparation immediately.
NPC2 was collected as in supernatant after centrifugation at 2,600 g. The pH of isolated medium was adjusted by Tris pH 8.0 stock solution for a final concentration of 50 mM. Stock solutions of NiCl 2 and CaCl 2 were subsequently added for final concentrations of 4 mM and 5 mM, respectively. After incubation at 4°C for about 1 hr, Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) was added to the mixture, which was then washed with buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with the washed buffer plus 250 mM imidazole. The eluate was concentrated and applied to SEC (Superdex 200® Increase, 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in the buffer containing 25 mM MES pH 5.5 and 150 mM NaCl. The peak fractions were concentrated to 18 mg/mL and incubated with 20 mg/mL NPC1 at 4°C and a molar ratio of 1:5 overnight before sample preparation.
The cryo grids were prepared using Thermo Fisher Vitrobot Mark IV. 0.05% (w/v) fluorinated octyl maltoside (FOM, Anatrace) was added to NPC1-nanodiscsright before sample preparation. Aliquots of 3.5 μl purified NPC1 or NPC1-NPC2 complex were applied to glow-discharged grids (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3). After being blotted for 3.5 s, the grids were plunged into liquid ethane cooled with liquid nitrogen.
Micrograph stacks (numbers for each structure specified in the next section) were automatically collected with SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 32. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ) on Titan Krios at 300 kV equipped with K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan), Quantum energy filter (Gatan) and Cs corrector (Thermo Fisher Scientific), at a nominal magnification of 105,000 × with defocus values from −2.0 μm to −1.2 μm. Each stack was exposed in super-resolution mode for 5.6 s with an exposing time of 0.175 s per frame, resulting in 32 frames per stack. The total dose was about 50 e - /Å 2 for each stack. The stacks were motion corrected with MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 68. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) and binned twofold, resulting in a pixel size of 1.114 Å/pixel, meanwhile dose weighting was performed ( Grant and Grigorieff, 2015 21. Grant, T. ∙ Grigorieff, N. Measuring the optimal exposure for single particle cryo-EM using a 2.6 Å reconstruction of rotavirus VP6 eLife. 2015; 4 :e06980 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ). The defocus values were estimated with Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 66. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In total, four datasets with 4151/2523/3822/7088micrographs were collected for NPC1-nanodisc, NPC1-8.0, NPC1-5.5, and NPC1-NPC2 complex, respectively. After 2D classification, a total of 1,543,728/1,127,783/1,285,787 /977,144 selected from 1,978,162/1,547,319/2,089,187/3,802,614 auto-picked particles were subjected to a guided multi-reference classification procedure for each dataset, respectively. The references, one good class and several bad ones, were generated with limited particles in advance. A total of 893,982/813,922/626,128/608,876 particles were selected from the good classes, respectively. The good particles for NPC1-8.0 were subject to a 3D auto-refinement with an adapted mask, resulting a 3D reconstruction at 3.0 Å. The good particles for other three datasets were further classified as follows.
The good particles selected from multi-reference classification were subject to a global angular search classification (one class and 40 iterations), followed by 9 parallel runs of local angular search 3D classification with four classes for the 32nd - 40th iterations. A total of 452,012 good particles were selected and subject to a guided multi-reference classification procedure with 3 references (one good and three bad) and local alignment. A total of 378,090 particles selected and applied to a skip-aligned 3D classification with an adapted mask and 3X parallel runs. A total of 284,427 particles were combined from good classes and applied to a 3D auto-refinement with an adapted mask, yielding a 3D map at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å.
The good particles selected from multi-references 3D classification were subject to further classification without alignment with an adapted mask on the lumenal domains. Three parallel runs generating 6, 8 and 10 classes were performed at the same time. Then, a total of 179,336 particles were selected as state NPC1-5.5a with distinct NTD positioning from state NPC1-5.5b, which was composed of 169,487 particles. The two conformations yielded 3D reconstitutions with 3.7 Å (NPC1-5.5a) and 3.9 Å (NPC1-5.5b) after 3D auto-refinement with adapted masks.
The good particles selected from multi-references 3D classification were subject to a global angular search classification (one class and 35 iterations), followed by 6 parallel runs of local angular search 3D classification with four classes for the 30th - 35th iterations. A total of 415,845 good particles were selected and subject to local angular search 3D classification with four guided references, resulting in 175,470 particles in the good class. The particles selected from the good class were further classified without alignment for 4, 6, 8 and 10 classes, parallelly. Finally, 101,364 good particles from this round of classification yielded a 3D reconstruction with an overall resolution of 4.0 Å after 3D auto-refinement with an adapted mask.
All 2D classification, 3D classification, and 3D auto-refinement were performed with RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 69. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). Resolutions were estimated with the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation 0.143 criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 49. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ) with high-resolution noise substitution.
The map at 3.0 Å was used to build a more accurate model for NPC1 at pH 8.0. Previously reported crystal structures of NTD (PDB code: 3GKI ) and NPC1 ∗ (PDB code: 5U74 ) were used as initial models to be docked into the map with Chimera, following by manual adjustment in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 13. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate the final structure. Then, the new NPC1 model was used as an initial model for NPC1 in the maps for NPC1-nanodisc, NPC1-5.5a, NPC1-5.5b and the complex. Previously reported NPC2 structure (PDB code: 5KWY ) was used as the initial model for NPC2 in the complex map. After docking with Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 42. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ), the models were adjusted manually in Coot to generate the final models.
All structure refinements were carried out by PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) in real space with secondary structure and geometry restraints. Overfitting of the models was monitored by refining the model against one of the two independent half maps and testing the refined model against the other map ( Amunts et al., 2014 2. Amunts, A. ∙ Brown, A. ∙ Bai, X.C. ... Structure of the yeast mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit Science. 2014; 343 :1485-1489 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates. After transfection for 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS three times. To stain intracellular free cholesterol, a freshly prepared ∼50 μg/ml filipin (MilliporeSigma) solution in PBS was added to cells and incubated for 1∼2 h in the dark at room temperature. After three rinses with PBS, cells were mounted with ProLong® Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen™). For immunostaining of LAMP-1, cells were permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at RT, followed by overnight incubation with the primary anti-LAMP-1 (Santa Cruz, sc-20011, 1:100) diluted in the blocking solution. Cells were washed with PBS for 3 × 10 min and incubated for 1 h at RT with Alexa Fluor® 594 secondary antibody (Invitrogen™). Cells were washed with PBS for 3 × 10 min, followed by mounting in ProLong® Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen™). Stained cells were imaged using an Olympus FV1200 laser-scanning microscope equipped with four detectors and six laser lines (405, 488, 559, and 635 nm). Laser line 405 nm was used to detect filipin signals, 488 nm to detect GFP signals, and 559 nm to detect LAMP-1 signals. The manufacturer’s software and Fiji software were used for data acquisition and analysis. To assay the functions of NPC1-GFP variants, NPC1-deficient CHO cells overexpressing wild-type NPC1-GFP were used as a positive control (completely loss of filipin-positive late endososmal/lysosomal puncta), and those cells overexpressing NPC1(P691S)-GFP as negative control (persistent intracellular filipin-positive late endososmal/lysosomal puncta). Filipin staining showing NPC phenotype in cells expressing NPC1-GFP variants was determined by the appearance of any intracellular filipin-positive puncta as shown in the negative control. The number of these cells were counted, and the “Percentage of NPC1-GFP expressing cells with NPC phenotype” was calculated as (number of transfected cells with filipin-positive puncta / total number of transfected cells) ⨉ 100. To measure the co-localization between GFP and LAMP-1 signals, the ‘Coloc 2′ plugin in Fiji software was used with Threshold regression setting as Costes, PSF as 3.0 and Costes randomization as 10. The Pearson correlation coefficient values (no threshold) within individual region of interest that represents NPC1-GFP expressing cells were recorded.
The local resolution map was calculated using RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 69. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). Resolutions were estimated with the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation 0.143 criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 49. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ) with high-resolution noise substitution. Statistical analysis of NPC1-GFP colocalization with LAMP-1 was performed using Prism 8 for Windows Ver. 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) with one-way ANOVA by comparing GFP control and each variant to wild-type NPC1. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D.
