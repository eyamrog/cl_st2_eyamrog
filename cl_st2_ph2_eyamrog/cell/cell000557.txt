Title: Synthetic mammalian signaling circuits for robust cell population control


Abstract: Summary

In multicellular organisms, cells actively sense and control their own population density. Synthetic mammalian quorum-sensing circuits could provide insight into principles of population control and extend cell therapies. However, a key challenge is reducing their inherent sensitivity to “cheater” mutations that evade control. Here, we repurposed the plant hormone auxin to enable orthogonal mammalian cell-cell communication and quorum sensing. We designed a paradoxical population control circuit, termed “Paradaux,” in which auxin stimulates and inhibits net cell growth at different concentrations. This circuit limited population size over extended timescales of up to 42 days of continuous culture. By contrast, when operating in a non-paradoxical regime, population control became more susceptible to mutational escape. These results establish auxin as a versatile “private” communication system and demonstrate that paradoxical circuit architectures can provide robust population control.

Section: Introduction

Cells use intercellular communication systems to sense and control their own cell population density. In microbial communities, cells secrete diffusive signals to coordinate cooperative behaviors through the process of quorum sensing ( Waters and Bassler, 2005 77. Waters, C.M. ∙ Bassler, B.L.

In multicellular organisms, intercellular communication is essential to enabling precise developmental patterning ( Gibb et al., 2010 21. Gibb, S. ∙ Maroto, M. ∙ Dale, J.K.

Keener, J. ∙ Sneyd, J. Springer Verlag), 2009 Google Scholar , chap. 16). Synthetic intercellular communication systems could similarly allow the engineering of inherently multicellular behaviors not possible with cell-autonomous circuits ( Toda et al., 2018 73.

For example, in bacteria, foundational synthetic biology studies showed how coupling quorum-sensing systems to cell death could enable bacteria to limit their own population size ( You et al., 2004 78.

In mammalian cells, an orthogonal or “private” communication channel that allows specific communication between cells could enable engineering of analogous circuits ( Figure 1 A). Mammalian cells have been engineered to produce, sense, and process signals from natural ligands by rewiring signaling pathways, such as Nodal-Lefty, Sonic Hedgehog, and Notch ( Matsuda et al., 2012 44. Matsuda, M. ∙ Koga, M. ∙ Nishida, E. ... Synthetic signal propagation through direct cell-cell interaction Sci. Signal. 2012; 5 :ra31 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sekine et al., 2018 63. Sekine, R. ∙ Shibata, T. ∙ Ebisuya, M. Synthetic mammalian pattern formation driven by differential diffusivity of Nodal and Lefty Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5456 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li and Elowitz, 2019 38. Li, P. ∙ Elowitz, M.B. Communication codes in developmental signaling pathways Development. 2019; 146 :dev170977 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), and by repurposing the amino acid tryptophan as a signaling molecule ( Bacchus et al., 2012 1. Bacchus, W. ∙ Lang, M. ∙ El-Baba, M.D. ... Synthetic two-way communication between mammalian cells Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :991-996 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these approaches are not orthogonal to endogenous systems. On the other hand, synNotch receptors allow multiple orthogonal communication channels but depend on cell contact interactions to mediate diffusible signaling ( Toda et al., 2020 74. Toda, S. ∙ McKeithan, W.L. ∙ Hakkinen, T.J. ... Engineering synthetic morphogen systems that can program multicellular patterning Science. 2020; 370 :327-331 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The ideal private communication system for mammalian population control would use a diffusible signal, avoid undesired interactions with non-engineered cells, permit external control over the strength of signaling, and operate in a broad variety of cell types. It should also allow direct and rapid control of diverse target protein activities to allow flexible interfacing within cells and exhibit minimal immunogenicity to facilitate potential biomedical applications. Auxins, a class of plant-specific hormones that coordinate growth and behavior, including root initiation, embryogenesis, and tropism ( Tanaka et al., 2006 71. Tanaka, H. ∙ Dhonukshe, P. ∙ Brewer, P.B. ... Spatiotemporal asymmetric auxin distribution: a means to coordinate plant development Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63 :2738-2754 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ), represent an excellent candidate for this role. Molecularly, auxin induces protein-protein interactions between the F-box transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) protein and its target proteins. This leads to the assembly of a Skp-, Cullin-, F-box-containing (SCF) complex, which, in turn, recruits E2 ubiquitin ligases that target specific proteins for degradation ( Reitsma et al., 2017 56. Reitsma, J.M. ∙ Liu, X. ∙ Reichermeier, K.M. ... Composition and regulation of the cellular repertoire of SCF ubiquitin ligases Cell. 2017; 171 :1326-1339.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because TIR1 and its targets are absent in mammals, auxin does not regulate endogenous mammalian proteins. However, ectopic expression of TIR1 from rice (osTIR1) is sufficient to confer auxin-dependent degradation of proteins engineered to contain a minimal auxin inducible degron (mAID, or AID for simplicity in this paper) ( Nishimura et al., 2009 50. Nishimura, K. ∙ Fukagawa, T. ∙ Takisawa, H. ... An auxin-based degron system for the rapid depletion of proteins in nonplant cells Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :917-922 Crossref Scopus (1041) PubMed Google Scholar ; Natsume et al., 2016 49. Natsume, T. ∙ Kiyomitsu, T. ∙ Saga, Y. ... Rapid protein depletion in human cells by auxin-inducible Degron tagging with short homology donors Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :210-218 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, auxin is orthogonal to endogenous mammalian pathways but can enable direct control of cellular activities through engineered protein targets. Additionally, in yeast, ectopic expression of bacterial indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) hydrolase was shown to catalyze auxin production from an inactive precursor indole-3-acetamide (IAM), allowing control over auxin production ( Khakhar et al., 2016 34. Khakhar, A. ∙ Bolten, N.J. ∙ Nemhauser, J. ... Cell-cell communication in yeast using auxin biosynthesis and auxin responsive CRISPR transcription factors ACS Synth. Biol. 2016; 5 :279-286 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, a full auxin sending and receiving signaling system, which is necessary for population control, has not been established in mammalian cells.
A critical challenge for any population control circuit is evolutionary robustness. By limiting growth, a population control circuit inherently selects for “cheater” mutations that escape regulation. In bacteria, toxin-antitoxin systems and periodic strain replacement can prevent cheater escape ( Stirling et al., 2018 67. Stirling, F. ∙ Bitzan, L. ∙ O’Keefe, S. ... Rational design of evolutionarily stable microbial kill switches Mol. Cell. 2018; 72 :395 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liao et al., 2019 40. Liao, M.J. ∙ Din, M.O. ∙ Tsimring, L. ... Rock-paper-scissors: engineered population dynamics increase genetic stability Science. 2019; 365 :1045-1049 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these systems use components that do not function in mammalian cells or are not cell-autonomous. In the mammalian context, a seminal analysis of natural cell population size control systems in cytokine- and glucose-sensing circuits revealed a paradoxical architecture in which a single signal stimulates both proliferation and death of the same target cell population, to actively select against cheaters ( Hart et al., 2014 26. Hart, Y. ∙ Reich-Zeliger, S. ∙ Antebi, Y.E. ... Paradoxical signaling by a secreted molecule leads to homeostasis of cell levels Cell. 2014; 158 :1022-1032 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this paradoxical design, mutations that diminish signal sensing lead to cell death and are eliminated ( Karin and Alon, 2017 31. Karin, O. ∙ Alon, U. Biphasic response as a mechanism against mutant takeover in tissue homeostasis circuits Mol. Syst. Biol. 2017; 13 :933 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite its power and elegance, the paradoxical architecture has not, to our knowledge, been demonstrated synthetically in living cells.
Here, we engineer the auxin pathway to act as a private mammalian communication channel and use it to construct and analyze synthetic population control circuits with different architectures. Combining auxin-synthesizing enzymes and auxin transporters, and employing alternative auxin precursors, we show that the auxin pathway can be used for synthetic quorum sensing in mammalian cells. Using this pathway, we constructed and compared negative feedback and paradoxical control systems that regulate their own population size through auxin quorum sensing. Although both circuits limit population size at early times, the paradoxical system enhances evolutionary stability, as predicted theoretically, extending the duration of population control. Together, these results provide a versatile, diffusible synthetic signaling module for private-channel communication and demonstrate how paradoxical control schemes can enhance the evolutionary stability of population control systems.

Section: Results

To establish and characterize auxin regulation of mammalian cell growth, we coupled auxin sensing to drug resistance and fluorescence. Specifically, we fused blasticidin S deaminase (BlastR) ( Kimura et al., 1994 35. Kimura, M. ∙ Takatsuki, A. ∙ Yamaguchi, I. Blasticidin S deaminase gene from Aspergillus terreus (BSD): a new drug resistance gene for transfection of mammalian cells Biochim. biophys. acta. 1994; 1219 :653-659 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), whose protein product is necessary for survival in the presence of blasticidin, to AID and mCherry domains, allowing auxin-dependent degradation and fluorescent readout of protein concentration, respectively. We then stably integrated this chimeric gene, along with a constitutively co-expressed osTIR1, in Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) cells to create an auxin-sensitive “receiver” cell line ( Figure 1 B).
To validate auxin regulation of mCherry-AID-BlastR, we cultured receivers in media containing different concentrations of two auxin variants: either the major natural auxin, IAA, or a synthetic auxin analog, 1-napthalenatic acid (NAA) ( Figure 1 C). Both auxins reduced mCherry fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner, with EC 50 values of 0.11 and 0.76 μM, respectively. Addition of IAA to media containing blasticidin was sufficient to degrade BlastR and inhibit cell survival ( Figure 1 D). This effect was dose dependent with both blasticidin and IAA. Comparing fluorescence of mCherry-AID-BlastR in Figure 1 C with cell survival in Figure 1 D shows that a small amount of mCherry-AID-BlastR is sufficient to enable survival in blasticidin. These results confirmed that the AID domain and osTIR1 together are sufficient to enable net growth regulation by auxin (IAA) in mammalian cells.
In addition to sensing, a population control system requires that cells produce auxin at levels sufficient to trigger responses in receiving cells ( Khakhar et al., 2016 34. Khakhar, A. ∙ Bolten, N.J. ∙ Nemhauser, J. ... Cell-cell communication in yeast using auxin biosynthesis and auxin responsive CRISPR transcription factors ACS Synth. Biol. 2016; 5 :279-286 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Auxin can be synthesized in two enzymatic steps: (1) oxidation of L-tryptophan to IAM and (2) hydrolysis of IAM to IAA ( Figure S1 A; Sitbon et al., 1992 66. Sitbon, F. ∙ Hennion, S. ∙ Sundberg, B. ... Transgenic tobacco plants coexpressing the Agrobacterium tumefaciens iaaM and iaaH genes display altered growth and indoleacetic acid metabolism Plant Physiol. 1992; 99 :1062-1069 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). By itself, the second enzymatic step can produce either IAA or NAA from precursors IAM or 1-naphthaleneacetamide (NAM), respectively, enabling direct control of auxin production ( Figure 2 A; Kawaguchi et al., 1991 32. Kawaguchi, M. ∙ Kobayashi, M. ∙ Sakurai, A. ... The presence of an enzyme that converts IndoIe-3-acetamide into IAA in wild and cultivated rice Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32 :143-149 Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar ). To identify enzymes that efficiently catalyze this reaction, we compared thirteen IAM hydrolases from bacteria and plants ( Figure S1 B, left), transiently expressed them individually in receivers, and measured their ability to downregulate AID-tagged mCherry fluorescence by flow cytometry.
Three enzymes reduced mCherry to levels comparable with that produced by addition of IAA itself ( Figure S1 B). Among these, we selected A. tumefaciens iaaH for further use. We stably integrated it in receivers to create a sender-receiver cell line ( Figure 2 B). After 2 days of culturing sender-receivers in media containing the IAM precursor, the resulting conditioned media, diluted into an equal volume of fresh media for optimum cell growth, reduced mCherry-AID-BlastR to levels comparable with those generated by saturating concentrations of IAA ( Figures 2 C and 2D). The sender-receiver line was also able to produce the auxin NAA (which, as shown below, has some advantages compared with IAA) from its corresponding precursor NAM ( Figure 2 D), albeit with a diminished response compared with NAA, consistent with the higher EC 50 of NAA compared with IAA. These results show that iaaH expression in mammalian cells can efficiently produce both auxins from corresponding precursors.
The ability to synthesize auxin in mammalian cells without exogenous precursors could facilitate in vivo applications of population control circuits. Bacterial auxin (IAA) synthesis pathways use a tryptophan 2-monooxygenase, iaaM (also known as aux1 or TMO), to synthesize IAM from L-tryptophan ( Figure S1 A). Sender-receivers expressing iaaM (from P. savastanoi ), cultured in media without precursors, produced auxin concentrations in conditioned media that were sufficient to degrade the auxin reporter in receiver cells ( Figure S1 C). Furthermore, iaaM-expressing receivers produced precursor in conditioned media, allowing auxin production by sender-receivers ( Figure S1 C). These results demonstrate the two-step iaaM-iaaH auxin synthesis pathway can operate in mammalian cells without exogenous precursors. However, in the following experiments, we used iaaH with added precursors to allow external control of auxin synthesis.
Population control requires integrating cell density over an extended spatial scale. To estimate the spatial range of auxin signaling, we seeded a field of sender-receivers adjacent to a larger region of receivers and applied media in a 1.5% agarose gel to prevent non-diffusive transport ( STAR Methods ). After 48 h, mCherry fluorescence was reduced in receivers proximal to the sender-receiver region, forming a long-range gradient. This effect occurred in the presence, but not the absence, of the IAM precursor, consistent with a dependence on IAA production ( Figure 2 E, bottom). Image analysis revealed auxin response in receivers declining to half its maximum value at a length scale of 15.6 ± 0.85 mm ( STAR Methods ), or approximately 750 cell diameters, from the source region, within 48 h ( Figure 2 E, top), consistent with expectations for a small molecule the size of auxin diffusing in buffered solutions ( Robinson et al., 1990 58. Robinson, D. ∙ Anderson, J.E. ∙ Lin, J.L. Measurement of diffusion coefficients of some indoles and ascorbic acid by flow injection analysis J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94 :1003-1005 Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar ; Figure S1 D; STAR Methods ). These results show that auxin can provide information about global cell density over an extended region and further demonstrate the possibility of using auxin as a synthetic gradient-forming morphogen for applications in synthetic developmental biology ( Teague et al., 2016 72. Teague, B.P. ∙ Guye, P. ∙ Weiss, R. Synthetic morphogenesis Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 :a023929 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next asked whether sender-receiver cells could sense their own population density by producing auxin at a rate proportional to population size and sensing auxin concentration in the local environment (quorum sensing, Figure 1 A, middle panel). We analyzed the dependence of reporter expression on cell population density in the presence of concentrations of each precursor (NAM and IAM) sufficient to generate saturating levels of auxin. With the NAM precursor, reporter fluorescence decreased in response to increasing population density ( Figure 3 A, darker blue line). By contrast, addition of IAM generated a strong, but density-independent, decrease in fluorescence ( Figure 3 A, light blue line). We reasoned that this density-independence could result from IAA’s limited membrane permeability at neutral pH ( Raven, 1975 55. Raven, J.A. Transport of indoleacetic acid in plant cells in relation to pH and electrical potential gradients, and its significance for polar IAA transport New Phytol. 1975; 74 :163-172 Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar ), potentially causing newly synthesized IAA to accumulate intracellularly. Although the rate of exchange is sufficient to fully induce receiver cells (on the timescale of days, Figures 2 D and 2E), it could be insufficient to prevent intracellular accumulation of IAA due to the faster rate of auxin production by iaaH (typically several μM per min) in the same cell ( Mishra et al., 2016 45. Mishra, P. ∙ Kaur, S. ∙ Sharma, A.N. ... Characterization of an indole-3-acetamide hydrolase from Alcaligenes faecalis subsp. parafaecalis and its application in efficient preparation of both enantiomers of chiral building block 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-2-carboxylic acid PLoS One. 2016; 11 :e0159009 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). To overcome this issue, we stably expressed the auxin exporter PIN2 from Arabidopsis thaliana ( Petrásek et al., 2006 52. Petrásek, J. ∙ Mravec, J. ∙ Bouchard, R. ... PIN proteins perform a rate-limiting function in cellular auxin efflux Science. 2006; 312 :914-918 Crossref Scopus (732) PubMed Google Scholar ) in sender-receiver cells (sender-receiver-PIN2 cells) ( Figure 3 B, right). PIN2 expression produced a modest decrease in auxin sensing, suggesting the transporter was functional ( Figure S2 A), but allowed quorum sensing across most of the full dynamic range of auxin concentration sensing ( Figures 3 B and S2 B). Cells responded similarly to cell density across different culture media volumes, indicating quorum sensing responded to cell density rather than absolute cell number ( Figure 3 C). Together, these results establish that sender-receiver cells can sense their own population density in two ways: using NAM without PIN2, or using either precursor with PIN2.
Linking quorum sensing to cell survival could enable cell population control ( Figure 1 A, right). To test this possibility, we seeded cells at different densities in media containing blasticidin to make cell growth dependent on BlastR levels, as well as the precursor IAM. After 4 days, cells seeded at high, but not low, densities exhibited reduced cell numbers compared with cells plated at the same density without IAM or IAA ( Figure 3 D). These results demonstrate density-dependent control of cell survival.
This negative autoregulatory feedback loop resembles a similar design in bacterial systems, where a quorum-sensing signal induces cell killing. The bacterial circuit was found to be susceptible to “cheater” mutations that allowed cells to escape control and grow to the limit of environmental capacity ( Balagaddé et al., 2005 2. Balagaddé, F.K. ∙ You, L. ∙ Hansen, C.L. ... Long-term monitoring of bacteria undergoing programmed population control in a microchemostat Science. 2005; 309 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ). For adherent mammalian cells, environmental capacity is limited by the surface area of the culture plate. We therefore define an escape event as cells growing to confluency (covering the full surface of the plate) and remaining confluent for the duration of the experiment. When we cultured the sender-receiver-PIN2 cell line in media containing blasticidin and IAM to activate the circuit, we observed escape after 16 days of culture ( Figure S2 C; Video S1 ), which reflects the acquisition of a “cheating” phenotype with which cells are able to proliferate in high auxin (IAA) and blasticidin ( Figure S2 D). These results show that simple negative feedback population control circuits in mammalian cells, similar to their bacterial counterparts, are susceptible to selection pressure for cheater mutations.

Sender-Receiver-PIN2 cells escape after 15 days of continuous culture, related to Figures 3 and S2 Cells were seeded into a 24-well imaging plate with 50 μg/mL of blasticidin solely (“uncontrolled”) or with 100 μM IAM (“population circuit on”) or IAA (“killing constitutive on”). Images of constitutively expressed NLS-citrine were taken with a 20× inverted microscope once per hour.
A “paradoxical” circuit architecture in which a quorum-sensing signal either stimulates or inhibits both cell proliferation and cell death, can make population control more mutationally robust by counterselecting against cheaters that lose signal sensing ( Karin and Alon, 2017 31. Karin, O. ∙ Alon, U. Biphasic response as a mechanism against mutant takeover in tissue homeostasis circuits Mol. Syst. Biol. 2017; 13 :933 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the paradoxical circuits, positive net growth can occur only at signal concentrations lying between two non-zero bounds, similar to the Allee effect in ecology ( Courchamp et al., 2008 13. Courchamp, F. ∙ Berec, L. ∙ Gascoigne, J. Allee effects in ecology and conservation 2008 Crossref Scopus (1045) Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A, blue regions). By comparison, the simpler, non-paradoxical negative feedback architecture in which signals only downregulate growth, exhibits positive net growth at all signal concentrations below a single upper bound ( Figure 4 A, lower left). Although both circuits exhibit stable fixed points at the maximum of their positive growth zones, they respond differently to cheater mutations that reduce auxin sensitivity (the predominant cheater phenotype observed in Figures S2 C and S2D). Specifically, with negative feedback alone, such cheater mutations extend the regime of positive net growth to higher signal concentrations and cell densities, providing a growth advantage over non-mutant cells ( Figure 4 A, lower right). By contrast, in the paradoxical circuit, the same mutation would cause signal sensing to drop below the lower bound, activating the cell death arm of the circuit ( Figure 4 A, upper right). In this way, the paradoxical circuit design should suppress escapes by cheater mutations that reduce or eliminate signal sensing.
We designed a paradoxical circuit in which auxin represses both proliferation and death, a configuration that is well suited to the inhibitory nature of auxin-dependent protein degradation ( Figure 4 A, upper left). In addition to auxin regulation of BlastR, we added a parallel regulatory pathway in which auxin negatively regulates cell death by inducing degradation of inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9), an ectopically expressed master regulator of apoptosis (caspase 9) activated by the small molecular dimerizer AP1903 ( Figure 4 B; Straathof et al., 2005 68. Straathof, K.C. ∙ Pulè, M.A. ∙ Yotnda, P. ... An inducible caspase 9 safety switch for T-cell therapy Blood. 2005; 105 :4247-4254 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ; Di Stasi et al., 2011 17. Di Stasi, A. ∙ Tey, S.K. ∙ Dotti, G. ... Inducible apoptosis as a safety switch for adoptive cell therapy N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365 :1673-1683 Crossref Scopus (1148) PubMed Google Scholar ). We added an AID domain in iCasp9 to provide auxin regulation, and fused it to the monomeric GFP variant mGFPmut3, to allow direct readout of its concentration ( Landgraf et al., 2012 36. Landgraf, D. ∙ Okumus, B. ∙ Chien, P. ... Segregation of molecules at cell division reveals native protein localization Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :480-482 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 B). This design allows one to operate the same cell line in three regimes, depending on what combinations of blasticidin and AP1903 are added to the medium. With only blasticidin, the circuit operates in the pure negative feedback regime; with blasticidin and AP1903, it operates in the paradoxical regime; and it has unregulated growth with neither inducer. Because it implements paradoxical regulation through auxin, we dubbed this circuit “Paradaux.”
To encode the Paradaux circuit, we designed a single multi-protein construct expressing osTIR1, the auxin-regulated iCasp9 system, and the auxin-regulated BlastR construct described earlier ( Figure 4 C). To eliminate one potential mechanism for evolutionary escape, we positioned BlastR at the C-terminal end of the construct, so that premature stop codon mutations would deactivate BlastR, decreasing survival. We integrated the construct to create stable monoclonal CHO-K1 cell lines for further analysis ( STAR Methods ). Because this line lacks PIN2, we used NAM/NAA rather than IAM/IAA for all Paradaux experiments. Survival of these cells increased monotonically with auxin in the presence of AP1903 and decreased with auxin in the presence of blasticidin, demonstrating that both branches of the Paradaux circuit were individually functional ( Figure 4 D, red and green lines). (An additional monoclonal line with an independent integration of the same circuit is shown in Figure S3 A.) Further, including both blasticidin and AP1903, produced a biphasic survival curve ( Figure 4 D, blue dots), the key requirement for paradoxical population control.
To identify parameter regimes, including concentrations of blasticidin and AP1903, that optimize its population control capabilities, we developed a mathematical model of the Paradaux circuit. Assuming rapid intracellular-extracellular auxin equilibration, as observed for NAA ( Figure 3 A), and timescale separation between fast intracellular dynamics and the slower cell population dynamics ( Figure S3 B, STAR Methods ), we derived an approximate model based on two differential equations. The first represents the extracellular auxin concentration shared by all cells, denoted 𝐴 . The second describes the cell population size, denoted 𝑁 , which ranges from 0 to the environmental carrying capacity, normalized as 1 ( STAR Methods ).
We assume auxin is produced at a constant rate per cell, 𝜆 𝐴 , and diluted by periodic media changes, approximated as a continuous process with rate constant 𝛿 𝐴 : d A d t = λ A ⋅ N − δ A ⋅ A (Equation 1)
We also assume cell growth can be described by a generalized logistic function ( Richards, 1959 57. Richards, F.J. A flexible growth function for empirical use J. Exp. Bot. 1959; 10 :290-301 Crossref Scopus (3053) Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 C; STAR Methods ), modified to incorporate the effects of blasticidin, 𝐵 , and iCasp9, 𝐼 , on growth: d N d t = R g ⁢ ( B , I , A ) ⋅ N ⋅ ( 1 − N ν ) (Equation 2)
Here, 𝑅 𝑔 denotes the cellular growth rate, a function that can be written as a sum of two Hill-like terms representing the combined auxin-dependent effects of blasticidin and iCasp9 on cell survival (see Equations 16 , 17 , and 18 for the exact form). The exponent ν is the non-linear correction parameter in the generalized logistic growth function ( Richards, 1959 57. Richards, F.J. A flexible growth function for empirical use J. Exp. Bot. 1959; 10 :290-301 Crossref Scopus (3053) Google Scholar ).
To constrain the effective biochemical parameter values in the model, we incorporated experimentally measured values of the sensitivity of AID-tagged proteins to auxin, the unperturbed cell growth rate, the auxin secretion rate, and the non-linear growth correction parameter ( Figures 1 C, S3 C, and S3D). Remaining parameters were fit using the auxin-dependent survival rates measured with either AP1903 or blasticidin ( Figure 4 D, red and green line). The model initially overestimated actual growth rates when both arms of the circuit were simultaneously active ( Figure 4 D, dashed purple lines), possibly due to previously reported synergy between apoptosis and blasticidin-dependent translational inhibition ( Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005 27. Holcik, M. ∙ Sonenberg, N. Translational control in stress and apoptosis Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6 :318-327 Crossref Scopus (1082) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore added a phenomenological synergistic interaction term to the growth rate expression ( Equation 19 ; STAR Methods ; Table S1 , parameter set 1; Figure 4 D, dotted line). Finally, we checked that experimental parameter values expected to be independent of integration site, such as maximum cell death and growth rates, as well as synergy and Hill coefficients, agreed, within ∼2-fold, with those measured for a second Paradaux monoclonal cell line with an independent integration of the circuit construct ( Figure S3 A; Table S1 , parameter set 2).
Before initiating challenging long-term analysis of population control, we used the model to systematically scan for AP1903 and blasticidin concentrations likely to favor paradoxical population control. For each pair of AP1903 and blasticidin concentrations, we classified the dependence of cell survival on auxin into one of five qualitatively distinct behaviors: (1) positive net cell growth across all auxin concentrations ( Figure 4 E, purple background, “uncontrolled growth” in Figure 5 ); (2) negative net cell growth across all auxin concentrations ( Figure 4 E, green background); (3) permissive growth in which cells proliferate only beyond a minimum auxin concentration ( Figure 4 E, pink background); (4) simple negative feedback control, analogous to the sender-receiver behavior ( Figure 4 E, yellow background, “negative feedback in Figure 5 ”); and (5) paradoxical control ( Figure 4 E, blue background, “paradoxical feedback in Figure 5 ”). Only the negative and paradoxical feedback regimes produce a non-zero, stable fixed point, allowing population control. The desired paradoxical regime occurred in a window of blasticidin and AP1903 concentrations centered around 50 μg/mL and 50 nM, respectively ( Figure 4 E). Further, this paradoxical window could be enlarged by optimizing the expression levels of iCasp9 and BlastR ( Figure 4 F). Within the paradoxical regime, the circuit produced the expected bistability of population size ( Figure S3 E) and robustness to mutations that eliminate auxin sensing, simulated by setting sensed auxin to zero ( Figure 4 G).
Additionally, we explored the effect of the 2–3 day time delay required for blasticidin to kill sensitive cells ( Sato et al., 2012 59. Sato, M. ∙ Ohtsuka, M. ∙ Miura, H. ... Determination of the optimal concentration of several selective drugs useful for generating multi-transgenic porcine embryonic fibroblasts Reprod. Domest. Anim. 2012; 47 :759-765 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 F). Time delays in negative feedback loops are known to produce oscillations under some conditions ( Elowitz and Leibler, 2000 19. Elowitz, M.B. ∙ Leibler, S. A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators Nature. 2000; 403 :335-338 Crossref Scopus (3502) PubMed Google Scholar ; Potvin-Trottier et al., 2016 53.

In simulations of the paradoxical circuit, inclusion of a time delay led to oscillations of population density with periods of 2 weeks or more depending on the value of the delay parameter, τ ( Equation 22 ). A bifurcation ( Martinez-Corral et al., 2018 42. Martinez-Corral, R. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Süel, G.M. ... Bistable emergence of oscillations in growing Bacillus subtilis biofilms Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E8333-E8340 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) between damped and sustained oscillations occurred at approximately τ = 4 8 h ( Video S2 ). Taken together, these results provided insight into parameter dependence and expected dynamics of the circuit and identified specific AP1903 and blasticidin concentrations for long timescale analysis of the experimental circuit.

Numerical simulation reveals delay bifurcation between damped and limit cycle oscillations, related to Figures 4 and S3 This movie shows simulated dynamics of the paradoxical feedback model for different values of the delay parameter, τ . For each value of τ , the simulation shows two trajectories starting from different initial conditions. Note the transition from damped to limit cycle oscillations between 42 and 54 h. Initial conditions were held fixed at a cell seeding density of 0.1 and auxin concentration of 40 and 16 μM for trajectory 1 and trajectory 2, respectively.
To experimentally analyze population control, we continuously monitored cultures of the Paradaux cell line using time-lapse movies ( Figure 5 B). We performed three sets of time-lapse experiments, the longest of which lasted for 42 days (an arbitrary timescale constrained by technical limitations). Cells were cultured in regimes of uncontrolled growth (no blasticin or AP1903, the “always positive” regime in Figure 4 E), negative feedback (blasticidin added), or paradoxical feedback (both blasticidin and AP1903). In the uncontrolled regime, cells grew to and remained at full confluence for the duration of the movie ( Figure 5 A; Video S3 ). In the latter two regimes, population dynamics exhibited oscillations, consistent with models incorporating time delays for blasticidin-dependent cell killing ( Figure S3 F).

Time-lapse imaging from Figure 5A reveals robustness of the paradoxical population control architecture, related to Figure 5 10,000 cells were seeded per well into a 24-well imaging plate (Figure 5A), with no control (100 μM NAM; left), negative feedback (100 μM NAM and 50 μg/mL blasticidin; middle), or paradoxical feedback (100 μM NAM, 50 μg/mL blasticidin, and 50 nM AP1903; right). Images of constitutively expressed mTagBFP2 were taken with a 20× inverted microscope every 4 h, in a 6 × 6 grid, and stitched together. Scale bars, 500 μm. This movie is from movie set 3 (STAR Methods).
The negative feedback regime limited population size for 1 or 2 oscillatory periods (∼20–30 days) after which cells escaped control (exceeded >95% confluence) for the remainder of the movie (at least 10 subsequent days, Figure 5 B). This behavior is consistent with the experimentally observed susceptibility of simple negative feedback control to escape mutants ( Figures S2 C and S2D) and simulated responses to introduction of sensing mutants ( Figure 4 G). By contrast, in the paradoxical regime, cultures exhibited oscillations in population density but remained at sub-saturating densities for significantly longer (p < 0.005, Kaplan-Meier estimate, log-rank test; Goel et al., 2010 23. Goel, M.K. ∙ Khanna, P. ∙ Kishore, J. Understanding survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier estimate Int. J. Ayurveda Res. 2010; 1 :274-278 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, over half of the cultures remained sub-confluent for the full duration of the movies ( Figures 5 A–5C; Video S3 ). More specifically, across the three movie sets and the 11 individual cultures in the paradoxical group, only one culture escaped control before the 32-day mark ( Figure 5 A, Movie set 3). Together, these results demonstrate that the paradoxical control circuit reproducibly extends the duration of population control.
To gain insight into how cells evolved during long-term culture, we isolated cells at the end of each of the 30 individual movies, passaged them in standard media, and assayed their behaviors under different conditions ( Figures 5 D–5H). The fluorescence of mCherry and mGFP, which are co-expressed with BlastR and iCasp9, respectively, varied substantially across all isolates, reflecting independently acquired changes in the expression of circuit components, rather than amplification of a common founder mutation already present in the parental cell line. However, variation of the two reporters was strongly correlated expression across isolates, suggesting that mutations or other adaptations occurred upstream of both circuit arms ( Figure 5 D).
The two population control conditions produced different effects on circuit component expression and phenotypic behavior. In cells selected under negative feedback conditions, basal BlastR expression was upregulated, on average, by 73%, and showed 49% less responsiveness to auxin compared with the uncontrolled group ( Figures 5 E and 5F; p = 0.014 and p < 0.001, respectively). By contrast, isolates from the paradoxical feedback conditions showed significantly lower basal BlastR expression (p = 0.008) and retained a larger dynamic range of BlastR regulation compared with negative feedback isolates (p = 0.007). These differences in BlastR regulation were also reflected in cell survival ( Figures 5 F and 5G). When cultured in a combination of blasticidin and NAA, mimicking high cell density, negative feedback isolates exhibited increased survival compared with the uncontrolled group (p < 0.001 Figure 5 G). Although individual paradoxical isolates also exhibited elevated survival, the increase compared with the uncontrolled condition was not significant at the group level (p = 0.085). We also note that the two isolates which were classified as cheaters in the final days of movie set 3 ( Figure 5 B, black arrows) were unable to survive in this condition ( Figure 5 G, pink dots with arrows), suggesting they could potentially have returned to lower cell density had the movie duration been longer. Together, these results suggest that paradoxical conditions preserved more of the original BlastR regulation and function compared with negative feedback conditions.
The paradoxical architecture is designed to suppress sensing-deficient mutations that reduce the responsiveness of both arms of the circuit to auxin. More specifically, cells that lose auxin sensing should no longer degrade BlastR ( Figure 5 I, lower right) and therefore obtain a growth advantage. By contrast, in the paradoxical circuit, such sensing-deficient cells would also be unable to degrade iCasp9, leading to their elimination ( Figure 5 I, upper right). Thus, sensing-deficient isolates from the negative feedback condition should become susceptible to killing through the iCasp9 arm, even in the presence of auxin. In fact, isolates from negative feedback conditions were sensitive to the combination of AP1903 and auxin, indicating that they had acquired the potential to be counter-selected under paradoxical conditions ( Figure 5 H, p < 0.001). Thus, cells with reduced sensing gain a growth advantage in negative feedback conditions but are counter-selected under paradoxical conditions, consistent with the principle of paradoxical control.
To better understand the heritable changes that drive adaptation during long-term culture, we sequenced the circuit from endpoint isolates from the first two movie sets. Several mutations appeared at elevated frequencies, occurring either in the AID domain fused to BlastR, consistent with positive selection through reduction of AID activity, or in osTIR1, near the 5′ end of the circuit transcript, potentially reducing expression of all circuit components ( Figure S4 A; Table S2 ). However, in most isolates, no mutations occurred at significantly elevated frequencies, suggesting that most relevant adaptations (observed in Figures 5 D–5H) lie outside the circuit itself.
Therefore, we performed RNA-seq expression analysis to investigate global transcriptional changes. Expression profiles from isolates cultured in the same conditions generally clustered together, suggesting that each operating mode of the circuit selects for a distinct set of gene expression changes ( Figure S4 B). In addition, solates from the uncontrolled growth conditions clustered with the parental cells, as expected. Pathway enrichment analysis further revealed that ribosome components, the primary targets of blasticidin, were significantly upregulated in both negative feedback and paradoxical conditions ( Figure S4 C). Proteasome components were upregulated only in negative feedback conditions ( Figures S4 C and S4D), which is consistent with opposite selection pressures on proteasome activity generated by auxin regulation of BlastR and iCasp9 in the paradoxical condition.
Taken together, these results indicate that diminished sensitivity to auxin provides the dominant growth advantage in the negative feedback condition ( Figures 5 E and 5F) but is counter-selected in the paradoxical condition where it triggers activation of iCasp9 ( Figure 5 H). By contrast, in the paradoxical condition, escape paths are more limited, accounting for the extended duration of population control.

Section: Discussion

Natural cytokine-based control circuits allow cells to regulate their own population dynamics, as well as those of other cell types. Synthetic circuits could provide analogous capabilities. To this end, we engineered simultaneous production and sensing of the plant hormone auxin in mammalian cells, and coupled it to genes controlling cell proliferation and death. The enzymes iaaH and iaaM, together with PIN2, allow cells to produce and export auxin. osTIR1 together with AID domains provide a simple, direct means of sensing auxin and coupling it to arbitrary protein targets ( Figures 1 and 2 ). These components thus provide a long-range private communication channel and enable the foundational property of quorum sensing ( Figure 3 ). Coupling quorum sensing to cell survival opens up the possibility of creating population control circuits, provoking the question of what circuit architectures can provide robust, long-term control. Consistent with previous work ( Karin and Alon, 2017 31. Karin, O. ∙ Alon, U. Biphasic response as a mechanism against mutant takeover in tissue homeostasis circuits Mol. Syst. Biol. 2017; 13 :933 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), mathematical modeling showed that a paradoxical architecture in which auxin inhibits survival mediated by BlastR and killing by iCasp9 can generate a range of qualitatively different behaviors and, in some regimes, suppress cheaters ( Figures 4 E and 4G). To experimentally realize this capability, we constructed the “Paradaux” circuit, and compared its operation in three distinct regimes—uncontrolled growth, negative feedback, and paradoxical—by using media with different combinations of blasticidin and AP1903 ( Figure 4 B). Long-term culturing for up to 43 days revealed that, although both negative and paradoxical feedback architectures can limit cell population size for weeks, the former is more susceptible to escape by sensing-deficient cheaters ( Figures 5 , S2 B, and S4 ). By contrast, the paradoxical design suppressed these cheaters, as predicted theoretically ( Figures 4 and 5 ) ( Karin and Alon, 2017 31. Karin, O. ∙ Alon, U. Biphasic response as a mechanism against mutant takeover in tissue homeostasis circuits Mol. Syst. Biol. 2017; 13 :933 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), and provided more robust population control for the conditions and timescales explored here.
In addition to quorum sensing and population control, the auxin cell-cell communication system opens up the possibility of engineering more complex multi-cell-type communication and control systems. For example, to record the relative distance between two groups of cells, one could engineer receivers that permanently activate in response to auxin secreted by a second cell type. Alternatively, one could take advantage of the two-step nature of auxin biosynthesis ( Figures S1 A and S1C) by separating the steps into distinct cells, thereby enabling a proximity-dependent AND gate. More complex cytokine-like, multi-channel circuits could be achieved by combining the auxin with additional diffusible, orthogonal signals. This approach could enable synthetic bidirectional signaling ( Zhou et al., 2018 79. Zhou, X. ∙ Franklin, R.A. ∙ Adler, M. ... Circuit design features of a stable two-cell system Cell. 2018; 172 :744-757.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ) or even Turing-like spatial pattern formation ( Turing, 1952 76. Turing, A. The chemical basis of morphogenesis Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1952; 237 :37-72 Crossref Google Scholar ). Candidate molecules for additional channels include the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellin, both of which have partially mapped biosynthetic pathways ( Early and Martin, 1990 18.

Abscisic acid synthesis and response The Arabidopsis Book. 2013; 11 :e0166 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and were previously engineered to induce protein-protein interactions, enabling them to regulate transcription or protein localization in mammalian cells ( Liang et al., 2011 39.

Rapid and orthogonal logic gating with a gibberellin-induced dimerization system Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8 :465-470 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). The plant isopentenyladenine (IP)-CRE1 cytokinin system, which has been successfully ported to yeast, uses a plant-specific hormone as a diffusible signal to induce phosphorylation and further transcriptional activation, providing an additional potential signaling system ( Chen and Weiss, 2005 9.

Biotechnol. 2005; 23 :1551-1555 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacterial autoinducers and synthetic proteins also provide attractive candidates for additional orthogonal signaling channels ( Hong et al., 2012 28. Hong, S.H. ∙ Hegde, M. ∙ Kim, J. ...

Engineering customized cell sensing and response behaviors using synthetic notch receptors Cell. 2016; 164 :780-791 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ).
With these developments, private communication channels, population sensing, and population control could improve engineered cell therapies by allowing cells to coordinate their responses and localize activities at target sites. Previously, several studies attempted to activate latent natural signaling abilities to trigger coordinated multicellular responses. For example, to locally stimulate immune function, T cells were engineered to secrete IL-12 and IL-18 upon tumor infiltration ( Chmielewski et al., 2011 11. Chmielewski, M. ∙ Kopecky, C. ∙ Hombach, A.A. ... IL-12 release by engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors can effectively Muster an antigen-independent macrophage response on tumor cells that have shut down tumor antigen expression Cancer Res. 2011; 71 :5697-5706 Crossref Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hu et al., 2017 29. Hu, B. ∙ Ren, J. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Augmentation of antitumor immunity by human and mouse CAR T cells secreting IL-18 Cell Rep. 2017; 20 :3025-3033 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, secretion of bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) by engineered T cells was shown to guide bystander T cells to attack at the cancer site, successfully improving infiltration and reducing toxicity caused by normal tissue expressing the target ( Choi et al., 2019 12. Choi, B.D. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Castano, A.P. ... CAR-T cells secreting BiTEs circumvent antigen escape without detectable toxicity Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :1049-1058 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ). Private auxin-based communication channels would complement these approaches by allowing engineered cells to not only specifically sense and limit their own local population size but also to enable conditional activation only beyond a minimum density. We therefore anticipate the incorporation of synthetic population control systems in future generations of engineered cell therapies.
Further work could improve the circuits presented here and circumvent their limitations. (1) The Paradaux cell line requires addition of the auxin precursors IAM or NAM for auxin synthesis. Although this provides a good external control method for our experimental setup, it might be suboptimal in therapeutic scenarios. For these applications, complete biosynthesis of IAA can be achieved by expressing tryptophan 2-monooxygenase (iaaM) in conjunction with iaaH ( Figures S1 A and S1C). (2) The use of blasticidin and its auxin-regulated resistance gene for growth control is not ideal, since antibiotics have complex effects on the cell, must be added to the media, and broadly affect all cells exposed to the drug, making them inappropriate for cell therapy applications. Enzyme-prodrug systems could provide an alternative approach with fewer non-specific effects on host cells ( Sharrock et al., 2020 64. Sharrock, A.V. ∙ Mulligan, T.S. ∙ Hall, K.R. ... NTR 2.0: a rationally-engineered prodrug converting enzyme with substantially enhanced efficacy for targeted cell ablation Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Trask et al., 2000 75.

Ther. 2000; 1 :195-203 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, a more generalizable, cell-autonomous system could be achieved by coupling auxin to a cell-cycle regulator, such as Cdk1, 2, or 3 ( Satyanarayana and Kaldis, 2009 60. Satyanarayana, A. ∙ Kaldis, P. Mammalian cell-cycle regulation: several Cdks, numerous cyclins and diverse compensatory mechanisms Oncogene. 2009; 28 :2925-2939 Crossref Scopus (605) PubMed Google Scholar ), or other genes ( Harborth et al., 2001 25. Harborth, J. ∙ Elbashir, S.M. ∙ Bechert, K. ... Identification of essential genes in cultured mammalian cells using small interfering RNAs J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114 :4557-4565 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) essential for survival and/or cell-cycle progression. (3) Due to the inherent time delays within the feedback loop, the Paradaux circuit exhibits oscillatory behaviors ( Figure S3 F) similar to earlier synthetic population control circuits in bacteria ( Balagaddé et al., 2005 2. Balagaddé, F.K. ∙ You, L. ∙ Hansen, C.L. ... Long-term monitoring of bacteria undergoing programmed population control in a microchemostat Science. 2005; 309 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reducing feedback delays or implementing more sophisticated control systems ( Chevalier et al., 2019 10. Chevalier, M. ∙ Gómez-Schiavon, M. ∙ Ng, A.H. ... Design and analysis of a proportional-integral-derivative controller with biological molecules Cell Syst. 2019; 9 :338-353.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) should facilitate non-oscillatory homeostatic dynamics. (4) Finally, although the paradoxical control system successfully extended the duration of population control, cells nevertheless accumulated adaptive changes ( Figures 5 and S4 ). Future work exploring even longer timescales should reveal how long the paradoxical design can extend the duration of control in the presence of strong selection pressure to subvert it.

CHO-K1 (Hamster cells, RRID:CVCL_0214, ATCC Catalog No. CCL-61) cells and their derivatives were grown on tissue culture grade plastic plates (Thermo Scientific) in Alpha MEM Earle’s Salts (Irvine Scientifics), supplemented with 10% Tet System Approved FBS (ClonTech, or VWR), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.292 mg/ml L-glutamine (GIBCO) or 1x GlutaMax (GIBCO). The complete media is filtered with 0.22 micron filters (Falcon).
For long-term culturing demonstrated in Figure 5 , cells were seeded in 24-well TC-treated plates (total media 500 μL per well) with imaging-grade plastic bottoms (ibidi inc. #82406), and media was changed every 12 hours with one of the following methods: 1) adding and mixing 200 μL fresh media into the well, taking out the media, and putting back 500 μL (movie set 1), or 2) taking out the media, adding back 350 μL and adding 150 μL of fresh media (movie sets 2 and 3). Both methods simulate a media refreshing rate of 0.693/day (equivalent to media half-life = 1 day). For movie sets 2 and 3, an additional centrifuge at around 2000 xg is applied for the old media to remove floating cells. This likely dampened the oscillation in them compared to movie set 1, as iaaH proteins have been shown to work in cell lysate (data not shown).
All constructs created in this work were assembled using standard restriction enzyme-based cloning and/or Gibson cloning ( Gibson et al., 2009 22. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (6393) PubMed Google Scholar ). mAID and osTIR1 coding sequences were amplified from addgene #72827 and #72834 ( Natsume et al., 2016 49. Natsume, T. ∙ Kiyomitsu, T. ∙ Saga, Y. ... Rapid protein depletion in human cells by auxin-inducible Degron tagging with short homology donors Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :210-218 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). iCasp9 coding sequence was amplified from addgene #15567 ( Straathof et al., 2005 68. Straathof, K.C. ∙ Pulè, M.A. ∙ Yotnda, P. ... An inducible caspase 9 safety switch for T-cell therapy Blood. 2005; 105 :4247-4254 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ). PIN2, mGFP, and iaaM coding sequences (CDS) were codon optimized for expressing in mice and synthesized as dsDNA at Integrated DNA Technology together with all oligos for cloning. Coding sequences for screening indole-3-hydrolases were synthesized as cloning plasmid at Twist Bioscience. All constructs were cloned into the piggyBac plasmids (System Biosciences Inc.) driven by a synthetic version of human EF1A promoter.
All cell lines used in this paper contained stable integrations of transgenes, and were typically clonal populations. To create each stable cell line, the following steps were followed: 1) Cells were first transfected with 800-1000 ng of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine LTX according to manufacturer's instructions. 2) 24-48 hours later, cells were transferred to selection media containing 10∼50 ug/ml Blasticidin as appropriate for 1-2 weeks. 3) Single clones were isolated through the technique of limiting dilution. For piggyBac constructs, the initial transfection consisted of the target plasmid along with the construct expressing the piggyBac transposase in a 1:4 mass ratio.
Cells are washed with DPBS (GIBCO) first and then trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO) for 1 minute at room temperature. The mixture was then neutralized by culture media and cells were resuspended in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (GIBCO) with 2.5 mg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). Cells were then filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon) and analyzed by flow cytometry (MACSQuant VYB, Miltenyi or CytoFLEX, Beckman Coulter). We used EasyFlow, a Matlab-based software package developed by Yaron Antebi ( https://github.com/AntebiLab/easyflow ), to process flow cytometry data. All fluorescence data were acquired as the median value of the gated population. For counting cells, 1000 CountBright beads (Life Technologies) were spiked into the sample before filtering, gated out by their fluorescence in analysis and used to estimate cell number in each sample.
The process is described in Figure 2 C. Cells were first seeded at about 20% confluence with fresh media for conditioning, and cultured for 2 days. The supernatant was collected as “conditioned media”, and further filtered with 0.22 micron filter or centrifuged at 300 g for 3 minutes to remove any remaining cells. The conditioned media was then combined with fresh culture media at 1:1 ratio, and applied to receiving cells.
For imaging experiments, cells were seeded at 24 or 96-well TC-treated plates with imaging grade plastic bottoms (ibidi inc.), as described above.
Snapshots were acquired on the EVOS imaging system (ThermoFisher) with the EVOS AMG 4x objective (0.13 NA), or a 10x olympus objective (0.30 NA), with the system's default auto-scanning function.
Time-lapse images were acquired on an inverted Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope with Zero Drift Control (ZDC), an ASI 2000XY automated stage, iKon-M CCD camera (Andor, Belfast, NIR), and a 20x olympus objective (0.70 NA). Fluorophores were excited with an X-Cite XLED1 light source (Lumen Dynamics). Cells were kept in a custom-made environmental chamber enclosing the microscope, with humidified 5% CO 2 flow at 37°C. Microscope and image acquisition were controlled by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). For results in Figures 5 A–5C, 12, 25 and 36 positions (about 665um x 665um each) were imaged in each sample, for movie set 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For movie set 1, 12 imaging positions are distributed on a 3x4 grid with 3.5mm intervals. For movie set 2 and 3, the positions are distributed in a 5x5, or 6x6 grid with 600um intervals, and later stitched using Fiji’s stitching plugin ( Preibisch et al., 2009 54. Preibisch, S. ∙ Saalfeld, S. ∙ Tomancak, P. Globally optimal stitching of tiled 3D microscopic image acquisitions Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1463-1465 Crossref Scopus (1613) PubMed Google Scholar ). Image of each position is acquired every hour for movie set 1, and every four hours for movie set 2 and 3. Figure S2 C and Video S1 were imaged with the same method as movie set 1 in Figure 5 .
For analysis in Figure 2 E, the images were background-subtracted, stitched together and masked by the constitutive mTagBFP2 fluorescent in blue channel (not shown) and quantified by summing up intensities of pixels that passed the mask. Error bars are standard deviations of four images at the same distance.
Silicone-based inserts (ibidi inc. #80269) were first attached to the bottom of TC-treated 6cm dishes (Thermo Scientific). Sender-receiver cells were seeded inside the inserts and allowed to settle down for 2 hours. The inserts are removed and the whole dish is washed with PBS twice to remove non-attached Sender-Receiver cells. Receiver cells were then seeded in the dish at approximately 20% confluence, and allowed to settle down for another 6 hours. To prepare agarose infused media, 2% low melting point agarose (EMD) was melted in alpha-MEM at 95°C for 10 minutes, and temperature was cooled to 42°C, before IAM and other ingredients of complete media (described above) were mixed in. Agarose infused media was applied to dishes with original media removed and allowed to solidify at room temperature for 20 minutes, before moved into the incubator.
Isolates were passaged for at least twice after the long term cultures, before harvested for genomic DNA extraction (Qiagen #69504, with on column RNA digestion). The extracted DNA were then used to amplified the region from the EF1a promoter to the polyA sequence (TaKaRa Bio #R010B) (position 824-8949 on the plasmid map), including all the open reading frames of all the circuit components. Sequencing library were prepped and indexed with Illumina Nextera XT kit (Illuminia #FC-131-1024) and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq, with 300nt pair-ended setup.
Cells were cultured for 2 days at under 80% confluence before harvested for bulk RNA extrusion (Qiagen #74104). The library preparation and sequencing were performed at Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genomics Laboratory at Caltech as service. Specifically, RNA integrity was assessed using Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies #5067-1513) and mRNA was isolated using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB #E7490). RNA-seq libraries were constructed using NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #E7770) following manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific #Q32854) and the size distribution was confirmed with Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies #5067- 4626). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 in single read mode with the read length of 50nt to the depth of 15 million reads per sample following manufacturer's instructions. Base calls were performed with RTA 1.13.48.0 followed by conversion to FASTQ with bcl2fastq 1.8.4.
To estimate the auxin diffusion coefficient, we modeled the system as a fixed concentration source, with the standard result for one-dimensional diffusion: 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑛 0 ⋅ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑥 2 ⁢ √ 𝐷 ⁢ 𝑡 ) (Equation 3)
In which, 𝑛 is the concentration as a function of time ( 𝑡 ) and space ( 𝑥 ) , 𝑛 0 is the fixed concentration source, 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 the complementary error function and 𝐷 is the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient of auxin has been previously measured to be 5 . 5 8 × 1 0 − 6 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑚 2 / 𝑠 ( Robinson et al., 1990 58. Robinson, D. ∙ Anderson, J.E. ∙ Lin, J.L. Measurement of diffusion coefficients of some indoles and ascorbic acid by flow injection analysis J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94 :1003-1005 Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar ). Therefore after 48 hours, the diffusion will expand to approximately 3 to 4 centimeters ( Figure S1 D). Compared to this ideal fixed concentration source model, the in vitro experimental gradient ( Figure 2 E) is expected to exhibit delays in both auxin production and auxin sensing. Nevertheless, the experimentally observed gradient length scale was similar to the theoretical model prediction (tens of millimeters).
To fit the mCherry’s response curve to auxin and population ( Figures 1 C, 3 A, 3B, S2 A, and S2B), we assumed the log of fluorescence ( 𝐹 ) follows an inverted Michaelis-Menten’s equation: 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝐹 ) = 𝐹 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 − 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑥 𝐸 ⁢ 𝐶 5 0 + 𝑥 (Equation 4)
Here, 𝐹 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 represents the basal level of fluorescence in log; 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑝 represents the max amplitude the population or auxin (represented by 𝑥 ) could reduce the fluorescent; and 𝐸 ⁢ 𝐶 5 0 represents the concentration, or population number when the reduction is half of the 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑝 .
In Figure S2 B, to avoid the problem that the above function ( Equation 4 ) does not extrapolate well when fitted with flat lines (controls and samples treated with auxin), we used 𝑥 = 1 0 3 and 𝑥 = 3 ⋅ 1 0 5 for the extreme values. More specifically, the “ideal dynamic range” was defined as 𝐹 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 1 0 3 ) 𝐹 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 1 0 3 ) , the “loss to self-sensing” was defined as 𝐹 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 1 0 3 ) 𝐹 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 1 0 3 ) , the “loss to saturation” was defined as 𝐹 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 3 ⋅ 1 0 5 ) 𝐹 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 3 ⋅ 1 0 5 ) , and the “actual dynamic range” was defined as 𝐹 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 1 0 3 ) 𝐹 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 3 ⋅ 1 0 5 ) .
Here we describe a dynamical model of the paradoxical population control circuit. The model is based on the following biochemical reactions, interactions, and assumptions: • Auxin, denoted 𝐴 , is synthesized from its precursor through an iaaH-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction at a constant synthesis rate per cell λ 𝐴 , eliminated at a rate δ 𝐴 , which is dominated by dilution due to media changes. Auxin diffuses rapidly in and out of the cell compared to the timescales of cell population dynamics, and its concentration is therefore assumed to be at quasi-steady state ( Equation 1 ). • iCasp9, denoted 𝐶 , and BlastR, denoted 𝑅 , are produced at rates λ 𝐶 and λ 𝑅 , respectively. • Auxin binds reversibly to osTIR1 to form an auxin-osTIR1 complex, which ubiquitylates and degrades iCasp9 and BlastR via their attached AID domains. These reactions are described using classical enzyme kinetics with the auxin-osTIR1 complex as the activating enzyme, described as a constant rate ν 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑏 . In addition to auxin-induced active degradation, iCasp9 and BlastR are also eliminated at rate δ due to dilution ( Equations 5 and 6 ). • The concentrations of iaaH and osTIR1 are assumed to be constant. Auxin precursor is assumed to remain at excess, saturating concentration. • osTIR1 is assumed to be present at excess concentration compared to the iCasp9-auxin-osTIR1 and BlastR-auxin-osTIR1 complexes, and therefore potential competition between iCasp9 and BlastR for osTIR1 can be neglected.
With these assumptions, we can describe the dynamics of iCasp9 and BlastR with the following differential equations: 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑅 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = λ 𝑅 − ν 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑏 ⋅ 𝑅 ⋅ 𝐴 − δ ⋅ 𝑅 (Equation 5) 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = λ 𝐶 − ν 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑏 ⋅ 𝐶 ⋅ 𝐴 − δ ⋅ 𝐶 (Equation 6)
The model represents blasticidin and AP1903 interactions as follows:
• Extracellular blasticidin, denoted 𝐵 , diffuses into the cell, where it is denoted 𝐵 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 , and undergoes subsequent enzymatic inactivation by BlastR, with a threshold concentration of 𝐾 𝐵 , and a Hill coefficient 𝑛 1 : 𝐵 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝐵 ⋅ ( 𝐾 𝐵 ) 𝑛 1 ( 𝐾 𝐵 ) 𝑛 1 + 𝑅 𝑛 1 (Equation 7)
• AP1903 forms an active caspase complex, [ 𝐼 : 𝐶 𝑛 2 ] with iCasp9, with a threshold concentration of 𝐾 𝐶 𝑑 and a Hill coefficient 𝑛 2 : [ 𝐼 : 𝐶 𝑛 2 ] = 1 ( 𝐾 𝐶 𝑑 ) 𝑛 2 ⋅ 𝐼 ⋅ 𝐶 𝑛 2 (Equation 8)
In these two cases, we allow the more general Hill kinetics to account for potential intermediate reaction mechanisms that could influence the effective cooperativity in the final expressions. Additionally, we assumed that both inactivation of blasticidin and iCasp9 binding to AP1903 are rapid and have reached steady state.
As described in the main text the overall population dynamics can be described using a generalized logistic function, with the growth rate represented as a linear combination of blasticidin-dependent and iCasp9-dependent terms ( Equation 2 ). The blasticidin-dependent growth rate, 𝐹 𝐺 , is a sum of two terms. The first describes attenuation of the maximum natural cell proliferation rate, α , with increasing blasticidin, while the second represents an increase in the cell death rate, β , with increased blasticidin. These terms are associated with half-maximal blasticidin concentrations of 𝐾 𝑔 and 𝐾 𝑑 , respectively: 𝐹 𝐺 = α ⁢ κ 𝑔 κ 𝑔 + 𝐵 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 − β ⁢ 𝐵 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 κ 𝑑 + 𝐵 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 (Equation 9)
For simplicity, we assume κ 𝑔 = κ 𝑑 = κ . Thus, Equation 9 can be reduced to the following form: F G = ( α + β ) ⁢ κ κ + B i n t − β (Equation 10)
We similarly describe the iCasp9-dependent cell death rate, 𝐹 𝐷 , with a Hill function dependence on the concentration of the AP1903-iCasp9 ( 𝐼 : 𝐶 𝑛 2 ) complex: 𝐹 𝐷 = β 𝐶 ⁢ [ 𝐼 : 𝐶 𝑛 2 ] [ 𝐼 : 𝐶 𝑛 2 ] + κ [ 𝐼 : 𝐶 ] (Equation 11)
Adding Equations 10 and 11 together and substituting the corresponding terms from Equations 7 and 8 , generates the complete form of the growth rate function 𝑅 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) in Equation 2 : 𝑅 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) = ( α + β ) ⁢ κ ⁢ [ ( 𝐾 𝐵 ) 𝑛 1 + 𝑅 𝑛 1 ] κ ⁢ [ ( 𝐾 𝐵 ) 𝑛 1 + 𝑅 𝑛 1 ] + 𝐵 ⁢ ( 𝐾 𝐵 ) 𝑛 1 − β − β 𝐶 ⁢ 1 ( 𝐾 𝐶 𝑑 ) 𝑛 2 ⋅ 𝐼 ⋅ 𝐶 𝑛 2 1 ( 𝐾 𝐶 𝑑 ) 𝑛 2 ⋅ 𝐼 ⋅ 𝐶 𝑛 2 + κ [ 𝐼 : 𝐶 ] (Equation 12)
To simplify this description, we assumed a time-scale separation between the faster auxin-population dynamics and the slower intracellular reactions involving 𝑅 and 𝐶 . Using singular perturbation theory ( Del Vecchio and Murray, 2014 16. Del Vecchio, D. ∙ Murray, R.M. Biomolecular Feedback Systems Princeton University Press, 2014 Crossref Google Scholar ), the system can then be approximated by a simpler system that retains only the slower dynamics ( Equations 1 and 2 ), while the faster dynamics ( Equations 5 and 6 ) are considered to be at equilibrium: 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑅 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 ≈ 0 . With this approximation, we can write 𝑅 and 𝐶 in terms of the auxin concentration, 𝐴 . 𝑅 = λ 𝑅 δ + ν 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝐴 (Equation 13) 𝐶 = λ 𝐶 δ + ν 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝐴 (Equation 14)
We also defined the following additional parameter combinations for simplicity (see Table S1 ): κ 𝐴 = ν 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑏 δ ; κ 𝐵 = 1 κ ; 𝑃 𝑅 = λ 𝑅 𝐾 𝐵 ; 𝑃 𝐶 = λ 𝐶 𝐾 𝐶 𝑑 ; κ 𝐼 = 1 κ [ 𝐼 : 𝐶 ] (Equation 15)
We can then substitute 𝑅 and 𝐶 in Equation 12 to obtain the following: 𝑅 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) = ( α + β ) ⋅ 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐴 ) − β − β 𝐶 ⋅ 𝐷 ⁡ ( 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) (Equation 16)
in which: 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐴 ) = ( κ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐴 + 1 ) 𝑛 1 + ( 𝑃 𝑅 δ ) 𝑛 1 ( κ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐴 + 1 ) 𝑛 1 ⁢ ( κ 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐵 + 1 ) + ( 𝑃 𝑅 δ ) 𝑛 1 (Equation 17) 𝐷 ⁡ ( 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) = κ 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐼 ⋅ ( 𝑃 𝐶 δ ) 𝑛 2 κ 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐼 ⋅ ( 𝑃 𝐶 δ ) 𝑛 2 + ( κ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐴 + 1 ) 𝑛 2 (Equation 18)
To verify the validity of the approximation, we compared the full model ( Equations 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) to the approximate model, where Equations 5 and 6 are set to 0. We simulated both models using the parameter values in Table S1 (the Paradaux set). The two sets of traces closely followed each other ( Figure S3 B), indicating that the approximate system accurately reproduced the dynamics of the full model.
As discussed in the main text, the model above overestimated actual survival rates when both arms of the circuit were simultaneously active ( Figures 4 D and S3 A, dashed purple lines), likely due to synergy between apoptosis and blasticidin-dependent translational inhibition. We therefore added a phenomenological synergistic interaction term: − β 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑛 ⋅ [ 1 − 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐴 ) ] ⋅ 𝐷 ⁡ ( 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) to the growth rate expression ( 𝑅 𝑔 in Equation 16 ): 𝑅 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) = ( α + β 𝐵 ) ⋅ 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐴 ) − β − β 𝐶 ⋅ 𝐷 ⁡ ( 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) − β 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑛 ⋅ [ 1 − 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐴 ) ] ⋅ 𝐷 ⁡ ( 𝐼 , 𝐴 ) (Equation 19)
Equation 19 gives the final form of the paradoxical growth curve with the synergistic correction, and is used to improve data fitting ( Figures 4 D and S3 A, dotted purple lines). Together with the fitted parameters, the reduced system ( Equations 1 and 2 , with 𝑅 𝑔 defined as Equation 19 ) was used to run parameter screens and dynamic simulations ( Figures 4 E–4G, S3 E, and S3F).
For numerical parameter screening and stability analysis, we computed some terms analytically to make the process faster and more efficient. The stability at equilibrium points of the reduced dynamical system ( Equations 1 and 2 ), is determined by its Jacobian matrix ( 𝑱 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑞 , see below) and its eigenvalues. 𝑱 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑞 = ( − δ 𝐴 λ 𝐴 𝑅 ′ ⁡ ( 𝐴 ) ⋅ 𝐿 ⁡ ( 𝑁 ) 𝑅 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ) ⋅ 𝐿 ′ ⁡ ( 𝑁 ) ) (Equation 20) Here, 𝐿 ⁡ ( 𝑁 ) = 𝑁 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑁 ν ) .
Note that in the operating range ( 0 < 𝑁 < 1 ) , 𝐿 ⁡ ( 𝑁 ) > 0 and 𝐿 ′ ⁡ ( 𝑁 ) > 0 ; and at any equilibrium points, 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑁 / 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 0 . Together with the explicit form of Equation 1 , the points above lead to 𝑅 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ) = 0 at equilibrium. Therefore, the eigenvalues ( λ 1 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 λ 2 ) of 𝑱 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑞 at equilibrium are the roots of the quadratic characteristic equation: λ ⋅ ( δ 𝐴 + λ ) − λ 𝐴 ⋅ 𝑅 ′ ⋅ 𝐿 ′ = 0 (Equation 21)
As noted above that 𝐿 ′ > 0 , the sign of roots (eigenvalues λ 1 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 λ 2 ) can be solely determined by the sign of 𝑅 ′ . For 𝑅 ′ > 0 , at least one of the eigenvalues has a real part greater than zero, making the associated equilibrium point unstable. For If 𝑅 ′ > 0 , we can deduce that the real parts of both eigenvalues are less than zero, making the equilibrium point stable. Based on this analysis, we screened the equilibrium points of the system and the corresponding sign of 𝑅 ′ to determine the stability and type of each parameter set ( Figures 4 E and 4F).
Besides the five major behavior categories described above ( Figure 4 E, surrounding plots), a small but significant portion (0.68% of total) of conditions appearing at the border between “permissive” and “paradoxical” types, could not be classified into any of the five types. To further investigate these cases, we down sampled the space from 201 x 201 to 21 x 21 conditions and plotted all the six (0.62% or total) unclassified curves, as well the permissive and paradoxical types next to this region ( Figure S3 G; grey, pink, and light blue respectively). Inspection of these curves revealed a transitional behavior between permissive and paradoxical, with the unusual equilibrium points caused by the nonlinearity of the introduced synergetic term. Note that the range of net growth rate of the system is around -0.09∼0.04 defined by α , α − β 𝐵 and α − β 𝐶 . The net growth rates of these curves around the unusual equilibrium points are significantly lower (-0.01∼0.02), indicating those points are unstable. Therefore, those curves’ dynamics, although not mathematically classified, will behave similarly to either permissive or paradoxical types.
To simulate the delay effect of blasticidin killing cells ( Sato et al., 2012 59. Sato, M. ∙ Ohtsuka, M. ∙ Miura, H. ... Determination of the optimal concentration of several selective drugs useful for generating multi-transgenic porcine embryonic fibroblasts Reprod. Domest. Anim. 2012; 47 :759-765 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), we added a time delay τ to the blasticidin related growth function ( Equation 17 ) at time 𝑡 , resulting in a delayed blasticidin growth term, 𝐺 ⁢ ( 𝐵 , 𝐴 ) 𝑡 − τ . We then replaced blasticidin related growth term 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐴 ) in Equation 19 with this new term with delay: 𝑅 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝐵 , 𝐼 , 𝐴 , τ ) = ( α + β 𝐵 ) ⋅ 𝐺 𝑡 − τ − β − β 𝐶 ⋅ 𝐷 𝑡 − β 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑛 ⋅ [ 1 − 𝐺 𝑡 − τ ] ⋅ 𝐷 𝑡 (Equation 22)
In the above equation, we omitted the arguments of the growth functions for simplicity (e.g. 𝐺 ⁢ ( 𝐵 , 𝐴 ) 𝑡 is simplified to 𝐺 𝑡 ). Additionally, for simulations in Figure S3 F and Video S2 we assumed 𝐺 𝑡 − τ = 𝐺 0 ; ∀ 𝑡 < τ . The results of this delay are the oscillations shown in Figure S3 F and Video S2 .
Images, regardless of acquisition conditions, were converted to grey scale for analysis in cases where pseudo-color was applied by the software automatically (a 2x2 binning is applied if acquired using the EVOS system). For each experiment, around 5 images were used in ilastik ( Berg et al., 2019 4. Berg, S. ∙ Kutra, D. ∙ Kroeger, T. ... ilastik: interactive machine learning for (bio)image analysis Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1226-1232 Crossref Scopus (1337) PubMed Google Scholar ) pixel classification mode to train a classifier (decision tree-based), that classifies each pixel as cell or not cell (the trained models are available with the full data set). The classifier was then applied to the entire set of images, and output as probability masks. The masks were then analyzed to determine the fractions of “cell” pixels in the image. This value was then used to estimate confluence.
The reads were first trimmed and filtered by Trim Galore! (Babraham Institute) and then aligned with Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 37. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (32373) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the template sequence (position 824-8949 on the plasmid map). After alignment, we calculated the distribution among four possible nucleotides at each position based on the result from the parental line, as our expected nucleotide distribution for each position (one pseudocount included to avoid significance calling due to low sampling size). We then compared the frequencies of such from other isolates to the expected distribution above to identify any significant deviation (Chi-Square test was used here as a good approximation for multinomial test. p<0.05 with Bonferroni correction). All the significant results are plotted, with their corresponding isolates origin and frequency, in Figure S4 A. Among these mutations, we assumed synonymous mutations follow normal distribution to set our expected mutation frequencies for neutral mutations, and determined any non-synonymous mutation that exceeds the 5th percentile (after Bonferroni correction) of this distribution is potentially positively selected ( Figure S4 A, red dotted line). These mutations are detailed in Table S2 .
The reads were first trimmed and filtered by Trim Galore! (Babraham Institute) and then counted with kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 7. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (4979) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the CHO transcriptome (RefSeq GCF_000223135.1) as a reference. Genes that are differentially expressed were determined with DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 41. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45412) PubMed Google Scholar ) and exported as ranked lists, with 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁡ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁡ 2 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑔 ⁡ 𝑒 ) ⋅ − 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑗 ) as weights. The top 30 genes in each of the three comparisons (negative vs control, paradoxical vs control and paradoxical vs negative), if not annotated with a symbol in the RefSeq file, are manually annotated by looking up their gene products in RSCB PDB ( RSCB.org ) ( Basner, 2017 3. Basner, J. Impact Analysis of “Berman HM et al., (2000), The Protein Data Bank” RCSB PDB, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ). The ranked gene list is then input into the GSEA ( Subramanian et al., 2005 69. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (32336) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform pathway enrichment analysis, against the curated KEGG pathway annotation (MSigDB: c2.cp.kegg.v7.4.symbols), with mapping from mouse gene symbol to human orthologs.
The curve and significance test in Figure 5 C are based on the Kaplan-Meier estimation of the “survival rate”. Between negative and paradoxical feedback, a log-rank test is performed with the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the estimated survival rate ( Goel et al., 2010 23. Goel, M.K. ∙ Khanna, P. ∙ Kishore, J. Understanding survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier estimate Int. J. Ayurveda Res. 2010; 1 :274-278 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), using the lifeline python package ( Davidson-Pilon, 2021 15. Davidson-Pilon, C. Lifelines, survival analysis in Python Zenodo. 2021; Crossref Google Scholar ).
For expression ratios ( Figure 5 F) and survival rates ( Figures 5 G and 5H), the means and standard deviations were calculated by normalizing treatment replicates to control replicates with bootstrapping. Specifically, for each isolate, we perform replicates for both the treatment (n=3 for Figures 5 F–5H) and control (n=3 for Figure 5 F, n=2 for Figures 5 G and 5H) group, then normalize the measurements from the treatment groups to the control groups, with all possible combinations (n=9 for Figure 5 F, n=6 for Figures 5 G and 5H). The means and standard deviations of all the normalized measurements were reported as a single data point with bars in the corresponding figures.
Significance tests in Figures 5 E–5H are from double-ended Student’s T test, with a null hypothesis that assumes the mean values of the means from each individual isolate are not different.
