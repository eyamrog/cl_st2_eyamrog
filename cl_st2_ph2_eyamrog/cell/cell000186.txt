Title: Structural Basis for Helicase-Polymerase Coupling in the SARS-CoV-2 Replication-Transcription Complex


Abstract: Summary

SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the 2019–2020 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated and transcribed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme (subunits nsp7/nsp8 2 /nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryoelectron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirales order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12 thumb. The structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function. We also observe ADP-Mg 2+ bound in the nsp12 N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain, detailing a new pocket for anti-viral therapy development.

Section: Introduction

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales ( de Groot et al., 2012 19. de Groot, R.J. ∙ Baker, S.C. ∙ Baric, R. ... Virus Taxonomy King, A.M.Q. ∙ Adams, M.J. ∙ Carstens, E.B. (Editors) Family Coronaviridae Elsevier, 2012; 806-828 Google Scholar ). These viruses are responsible for several zoonotic infections ( Snijder et al., 2016 77. Snijder, E.J. ∙ Decroly, E. ∙ Ziebuhr, J. The Nonstructural Proteins Directing Coronavirus RNA Synthesis and Processing Adv. Virus Res. 2016; 96 :59-126 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ). Deadly occurrences include the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-1 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks caused by MERS-CoV ( Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013 35. Hilgenfeld, R. ∙ Peiris, M. From SARS to MERS: 10 years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses Antiviral Res. 2013; 100 :286-295 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2, a β-CoV, has been identified as the cause of the current globally devastating CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic ( Wu et al., 2020 95. Wu, F. ∙ Zhao, S. ∙ Yu, B. ...

The Nidovirales order of viruses contains the largest known RNA genomes ( Nga et al., 2011 55. Nga, P.T. ∙ Parquet, M. del C. ∙ Lauber, C. ...

The nidovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; encoded by non-structural protein 12 [nsp12]) functions in a holo-RdRp (comprising nsp7/nsp8 2 /nsp12) to synthesize all viral RNA molecules ( Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019 44. Kirchdoerfer, R.N. ∙ Ward, A.B. Structure of the SARS-CoV nsp12 polymerase bound to nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2342-2349 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ; Subissi et al., 2014 80. Subissi, L. ∙ Posthuma, C.C. ∙ Collet, A. ... One severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein complex integrates processive RNA polymerase and exonuclease activities Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :E3900-E3909 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RdRp is the target for antiviral agents such as remdesivir ( Agostini et al., 2018 5.

Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease MBio. 2018; 9 e00221–e18 Crossref Scopus (1049) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yin et al., 2020 97.

Structural basis for inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from SARS-CoV-2 by remdesivir Science. 2020; 368 :1499-1504 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to its central role in replication and transcription of the viral genome, the RdRp contains an N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain with unknown function but with enzymatic activity that is also essential for viral propagation ( Lehmann et al., 2015a 49.

The holo-RdRp is thought to coordinate with a number of accessory factors during the viral life cycle ( Snijder et al., 2016 77. Snijder, E.J. ∙ Decroly, E. ∙ Ziebuhr, J. The Nonstructural Proteins Directing Coronavirus RNA Synthesis and Processing Adv. Virus Res. 2016; 96 :59-126 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sola et al., 2015 78.

One of these accessory factors is nsp13, a superfamily 1B (SF1B) helicase that can unwind DNA or RNA in an NTP-dependent manner with a 5′ > 3′ polarity ( Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004 38.

The nsp1, nsp13, and M proteins contribute to the hepatotropism of murine coronavirus JHM.WU J. Virol. 2015; 89 :3598-3609 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is presumed to be essential in all nidoviruses ( Lehmann et al., 2015b 50.

The helicase is thought to play crucial roles in many aspects of the viral life cycle, some of which can be uncoupled by point mutations ( van Dinten et al., 1996 87. van Dinten, L.C. ∙ Wassenaar, A.L. ∙ Gorbalenya, A.E. ...

Characterization of an equine arteritis virus replicase mutant defective in subgenomic mRNA synthesis J. Virol. 1999; 73 :5274-5281 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Besides helicase activities, nsp13 harbors RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity, which may play a role in mRNA capping ( Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004 38. Ivanov, K.A. ∙ Ziebuhr, J. Human coronavirus 229E nonstructural protein 13: characterization of duplex-unwinding, nucleoside triphosphatase, and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities J.

In addition to the two canonical RecA ATPase domains of SF1 helicases ( Saikrishnan et al., 2009 66. Saikrishnan, K. ∙ Powell, B. ∙ Cook, N.J. ... Mechanistic basis of 5′-3′ translocation in SF1B helicases Cell. 2009; 137 :849-859 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ; Singleton et al., 2007 74.

Biochem. 2007; 76 :23-50 Crossref Scopus (1019) PubMed Google Scholar ), nsp13 contains three domains unique to nidovirus helicases: an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a stalk, and a 1B domain ( Hao et al., 2017 34.

The role of these domains in nsp13 function in vivo is unclear, but substitutions in these domains or the interfaces between them have disruptive effects on in vitro helicase activity as well as on viral propagation ( van Dinten et al., 1996 87. van Dinten, L.C. ∙ Wassenaar, A.L. ∙ Gorbalenya, A.E. ...

Virol. 2005; 79 :696-704 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Biochemical and biophysical studies suggest that nsp13 and nsp12 interact ( Adedeji et al., 2012 3. Adedeji, A.O. ∙ Marchand, B. ∙ Te Velthuis, A.J.W. ... Mechanism of nucleic acid unwinding by SARS-CoV helicase PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e36521 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jia et al., 2019 40. Jia, Z. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Ren, Z. ... Delicate structural coordination of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus Nsp13 upon ATP hydrolysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :6538-6550 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ), but a stable complex has not been biochemically isolated or structurally characterized, and the mechanistic role of the helicase in SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription is unknown. Here we generate a stable nsp13:holo-RdRp:RNA complex and determine its structure by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 3.5-Å nominal resolution. The architecture of the complex provides constraints on models for nsp13 function and suggests a possible role of nsp13 in generating backtracked replication-transcription complexes for proofreading, template switching during sub-genomic RNA transcription, or both. Our structure also resolves ADP-Mg 2+ in the active site of the nidovirus-specific NiRAN domain, defining a new pocket for anti-viral therapy development.

Section: Results

To investigate the potential nsp13:holo-RdRp complex and its role in replication-transcription, we prepared active recombinant SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp and nsp13 ( Figures S1 and S2 A). Our measured k cat (∼15 s −1 ) for SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 ( Figure S2 ) is similar to reported k cat values for SARS-CoV hexahistidine (His 6 )-nsp13 (19 s −1 ; Tanner et al., 2003 83. Tanner, J.A. ∙ Watt, R.M. ∙ Chai, Y.-B. ... The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus NTPase/helicase belongs to a distinct class of 5′ to 3′ viral helicases J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :39578-39582 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ) or SARS-CoV MBP-nsp13 (2.3 s −1 ; Ivanov et al., 2004 39. Ivanov, K.A. ∙ Thiel, V. ∙ Dobbe, J.C. ... Multiple enzymatic activities associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus helicase J. Virol. 2004; 78 :5619-5632 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ) (there is one conservative amino acid substitution between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 proteins, SARS-CoV-2 nsp13-Val570 is Ile in SARS-CoV nsp13) but not to k cat values for SARS-CoV His 6 -nsp13 and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-nsp13 (0.2 s −1 and 104 s −1 , respectively; Adedeji et al., 2012 3. Adedeji, A.O. ∙ Marchand, B. ∙ Te Velthuis, A.J.W. ... Mechanism of nucleic acid unwinding by SARS-CoV helicase PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e36521 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differences in expression and purification protocols as well as different ATPase assays used could explain the variability.
We used native electrophoretic mobility shift assays to test binding of holo-RdRp and nsp13 to an RNA scaffold ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Nsp12 required nsp7:nsp8 to bind the RNA ( Figure 1 B, compare lanes 2 and 3), and addition of nsp13 to the holo-RdRp:RNA complex caused a super-shift, indicating stable complex formation ( Figure 1 B, lane 6). Addition of ADP-AlF 3 ( Chabre, 1990 14. Chabre, M. Aluminofluoride and beryllofluoride complexes: a new phosphate analogs in enzymology Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15 :6-10 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ), which inhibits nsp13 ATPase activity ( Figure S2 C), sharpened the super-shifted band ( Figure 1 C, lane 7), suggesting formation of a more stable, homogeneous complex. A stable complex was also detected using native mass spectrometry (nMS), revealing a stoichiometry of nsp7:nsp8 2 :nsp12:nsp13 + RNA scaffold ( Figure 1 C). The ATPase activity of nsp13 was maintained within the complex ( Figures S2 A and S2B).
To determine the structural organization of the nsp13(ADP-AlF 3 ):holo-RdRp:RNA complex (hereafter called the nsp13-replication-transcription complex [nsp13-RTC]), we analyzed the samples by single-particle cryo-EM. An initial dataset collected in the absence of detergent ( Figure S3 A) yielded poor maps because of severe particle orientation bias ( Figures S3 B–S3D). The particle orientation bias was eliminated by adding the detergent 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPSO), shown previously to reduce preferred particle orientation by limiting particle adsorption to the air/water interface ( Chen et al., 2019 16. Chen, J. ∙ Noble, A.J. ∙ Kang, J.Y. ... Eliminating effects of particle adsorption to the air/water interface in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy: Bacterial RNA polymerase and CHAPSO J. Struct. Biol. X. 2019; 1 :100005 PubMed Google Scholar ), yielding isotropic maps ( Figures S4 and S5 ).
The sample comprised three major classes: 67% of the particles belong to an nsp13 2 -RTC, 20% form nsp13 1 -RTC, and 13% form a dimer of the nsp13 2 -RTC ((nsp13 2 -RTC) 2 ; Figure S4 A). The major class (nsp13 2 -RTC) yielded a 3D reconstruction and refined model at a nominal resolution of 3.5 Å ( Figure 2 ; Figures S4 B–S4F; Table S1 ). The structure resolves the complete, post-translocated holo-RdRp/RNA complex to roughly between 2.8–3.3 Å resolution ( Figure S4 B), including the nsp8 N-terminal extensions that interact with the upstream duplex RNA and the complete NiRAN domain ( Hillen et al., 2020 36. Hillen, H.S. ∙ Kokic, G. ∙ Farnung, L. ... Structure of replicating SARS-CoV-2 polymerase Nature. 2020; Published online May 21, 2020 Crossref Scopus (548) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 92. Wang, Q. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Wang, H. ... Structural Basis for RNA Replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase Cell. 2020; 368 :1499-1504 Google Scholar ).
In the nsp13 2 -RTC, the nidovirus-specific nsp13-ZBDs ( Figure 2 A) interact with the nsp8 N-terminal extensions; one nsp13-ZBD (nsp13.1-ZBD) interacts with nsp8b, whereas the other (nsp13.2-ZBD) interacts with nsp8a ( Figure 2 ). The nsp13.1-ZBD interaction with the holo-RdRp is tripartite; besides nsp8b, the interaction includes the tip of the nsp12 thumb domain ( Figure 2 C). These interactions involve multiple residues that are universally conserved among α- and β-CoVs ( Figure 3 ; Data S1 and S2 ).
In addition to the nsp13.1-ZBD:nsp8b:nsp12 thumb tripartite interaction, nsp13.1-RecA1 is braced against nsp7 and the nsp8b head ( Figure 2 C). Other than the conserved nsp13.2-ZBD:nsp8a interaction ( Figure 3 B), nsp13.2 only makes additional interactions with nsp13.1 ( Figure 2 B).
Our cryo-EM analyses show that nsp13 1 -RTC and nsp13 2 -RTC complexes can exist. Nsp12 (the main RTC component) and nsp13 are expressed from the same viral open reading frame (ORF) as a single polyprotein ( de Groot et al., 2012 19. de Groot, R.J. ∙ Baker, S.C. ∙ Baric, R. ... Virus Taxonomy King, A.M.Q. ∙ Adams, M.J. ∙ Carstens, E.B. (Editors) Family Coronaviridae Elsevier, 2012; 806-828 Google Scholar ) and so are present at equivalent concentrations in vivo ( Bouhaddou et al., 2020 10. Bouhaddou, M. ∙ Memon, D. ∙ Meyer, B. ... The global phosphorylation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infection Cell. 2020; Published online June 28, 2020 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (674) PubMed Google Scholar ) (nsp13 was also added at an approximately 1:1 ratio to the RTC to prepare the cryo-EM samples). Because the nsp13 2 -RTC is resolved to much higher resolution ( Figure S4 ), most of our analyses in this manuscript focus on this complex, but both complexes could be physiologically relevant. The disposition of nsp13.1 in nsp13 1 -RTC is nearly identical to its disposition in nsp13 2 -RTC ( Figure S6 A), justifying our use of the higher-resolution nsp13 2 -RTC structure as the basis for our analyses. Because nsp13.2 is never present without nsp13.1 ( Figures S3 A and S4 A), nsp13.1 appears to be stably bound, whereas nsp13.2 is dissociable. Only nsp13 1 -RTC was observed in the nMS analysis ( Figure 1 C), but the nMS solution conditions, electrospray process, and transition to the gas phase may have led to dissociation of nsp13.2, likely explaining the discrepancy with the cryo-EM analyses.
The holo-RdRp:RNA complex and interactions with the nsp13-ZBDs were well resolved in the cryo-EM map ( Figures S4 B and S5 G), but structural heterogeneity in the nsp13-1B and RecA domains gave rise to poorly resolved maps that could not be improved by local refinement procedures. Maps filtered to the local resolution ( Cardone et al., 2013 13. Cardone, G. ∙ Heymann, J.B. ∙ Steven, A.C. One number does not fit all: mapping local variations in resolution in cryo-EM reconstructions J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 184 :226-236 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to model the overall domain orientations, and difference maps revealed that the added ADP-AlF 3 was bound, but the low resolution of the maps prevented detailed modeling.
The nsp13.1-ZBD interface with the holo-RdRp includes an adventitious CHAPSO molecule ( Figure 3 A). Despite this, the following points speak to the biological relevance of the complex. (1) The ATPase activity of nsp13, a measurable enzymatic property of the complex, was not significantly affected by the presence of CHAPSO ( Figure S2 B). (2) The nsp13.1:holo-RdRp interface (which includes CHAPSO) involves mutually conserved nsp13.1-ZBD, nsp8b, and nsp12 thumb residues that comprise a subset of the conserved residues participating in the nsp13.2-ZBD:nsp8a interaction that is free from CHAPSO ( Figure 3 ). Thus, the presence of CHAPSO in the nsp13.1:holo-RdRp interface did not generate an entirely new interface. (3) In the absence of CHAPSO, the cryo-EM reconstructions were not suitable for detailed modeling and refinement because of severe particle orientation bias ( Figure S3 ), but domain orientations could be modeled. Comparison with the no-detergent nsp13 2 -RTC map revealed that the presence of CHAPSO slightly altered the disposition of the nsp13.1-ZBD with respect to nsp8b, but the overall architecture of the complex was the same ( Figure S6 B).
Nidovirus RdRps contain an N-terminal domain that is lacking in other viral RdRps, the NiRAN domain. The target of NiRAN domain nucleotidylation activity is unknown, but the activity is essential for viral propagation in EAV and SARS-CoV ( Lehmann et al., 2015a 49. Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Gulyaeva, A. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J.C. ... Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :8416-8434 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to ADP-AlF 3 bound in the NTP site of each nsp13 helicase, ADP-Mg 2+ was clearly resolved bound to the nsp12-NiRAN domain ( Figure 4 ), prompting us to further investigate this domain.
Previously, a structure-based search with the partial NiRAN domain resolved in the SARS-CoV holo-RdRp structure revealed significant structural homology to protein kinases ( Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019 44.

This, combined with the NiRAN domain nucleotidylation activity identified by ( Lehmann et al., 2015a 49. Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Gulyaeva, A. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J.C. ... Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :8416-8434 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ), led Kirchdoerfer and Ward (2019) 44.

Nevertheless, structural studies reveal that AMP-PNP binds in the SelO active site but is flipped relative to the orientation of ATP in canonical kinases. Functional studies show that SelO pseudokinases are, in fact, active enzymes that transfer AMP, rather than a phosphate group, to S, T, and Y residues of protein substrates (AMPylation or adenylylation; Sreelatha et al., 2018 79.

Extensive sequence analysis identified three conserved sequence motifs within the nidovirus-specific N-terminal domain: A N , B N , and C N ( Lehmann et al., 2015a 49.

Overall sequence conservation between SelO and the NiRAN domain is essentially non-existent (<10%), but a structure-based alignment reveals that the key SelO catalytic residues are universally conserved within the NiRAN domain sequence motifs ( Figure 4 A) and conserved in spatial organization within the aligned active-site pocket ( Figure 4 B; Data S3 ).
The NiRAN domain in the nsp13-RTC structure is occupied by ADP-Mg 2+ , which is well resolved ( Figure 4 C). Remarkably, the α- and β-phosphates of the NiRAN domain ADP coincide almost exactly with the β- and γ-phosphates of AMP-PNP occupying the SelO active site ( Figure 4 B; root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] = 0.33 Å). All of the conserved active-site residues make interactions with ADP-Mg 2+ , as expected from the SelO structure, except NiRAN domain K73 and R116 interact with ADP β-phosphate, whereas the corresponding K113 and R176 of SelO interact with the similarly positioned AMP-PNP γ-phosphate.
The overall architecture of the nsp13-RTC places the nucleic acid binding channel of nsp13.1 ( Deng et al., 2014 21. Deng, Z. ∙ Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Li, X. ...

Indeed, a cryo-EM difference map, low-pass-filtered to 6-Å resolution, reveals the 5′ single-stranded overhang of the tRNA ( Figure 1 A) engaged between the RecA domains and domain 1B of nsp13.1 before entering the RdRp active site ( Figure 2 C; Figure S6 C).
Nsp13 is an SF1B helicase, which translocate on single-stranded nucleic acid in the 5 > 3′ direction ( Saikrishnan et al., 2009 66. Saikrishnan, K. ∙ Powell, B. ∙ Cook, N.J. ...

Chem. 2003; 278 :39578-39582 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unless the interaction of nsp13 with the holo-RdRp alters the unwinding polarity, which seems unlikely, the structural arrangement observed in the nsp13-RTC ( Figure 2 D) presents a conundrum. In the observed arrangement, the RdRp would translocate in the 3′ > 5′ direction on the tRNA strand, whereas nsp13 would translocate on the same strand in the opposite direction. Thus, in the proposed scenario, translocation of nsp13 competes with translocation by the RdRp, and if the helicase prevails, then it might be expected to push the RdRp backward on the t-RNA. Reversible backward motion of multi-subunit cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (DdRps), called backtracking, is a well-characterized feature of these enzymes ( Komissarova and Kashlev, 1997b 46.

The large active-site cleft of the cellular DdRp is divided into two sections by a conserved structural element called the bridge helix ( Figure 5 A provides a cross-section view on the right). The main cleft on top of the bridge helix accommodates the downstream duplex DNA, whereas a pore or channel underneath the bridge helix forms a conduit from solution directly into the active site ( Figure 5 A, called the secondary channel in bacterial DdRp; Zhang et al., 1999 99.

Crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNA polymerase at 3.3 A resolution Cell. 1999; 98 :811-824 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ). During normal transcription elongation, the NTP substrates enter the active site through the secondary channel ( Westover et al., 2004 94. Westover, K.D. ∙ Bushnell, D.A. ∙ Kornberg, R.D.

Crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNA polymerase at 3.3 A resolution Cell. 1999; 98 :811-824 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ). In backtracking, the DdRp and associated transcription bubble move backward on the DNA, whereas the RNA transcript reverse-threads through the complex to maintain the register of the RNA/DNA hybrid. These movements generate a downstream segment of single-stranded RNA at the 3′ end that is extruded out the secondary channel ( Figure 5 A; Abdelkareem et al., 2019 1. Abdelkareem, M. ∙ Saint-André, C. ∙ Takacs, M. ... Structural Basis of Transcription: RNA Polymerase Backtracking and Its Reactivation Mol.

Structural basis of transcription: backtracked RNA polymerase II at 3.4 angstrom resolution Science. 2009; 324 :1203-1206 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although evolutionarily unrelated to the DdRp, the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp active site has a similar general architecture ( Figure 5 B). In place of the bridge helix, the viral RdRp has conserved motif F (SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 residues 544–555; Bruenn, 2003 12. Bruenn, J.A. A structural and primary sequence comparison of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :1821-1829 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ), which comprises a β-hairpin loop. Motif F directs the tRNA to the top, whereas underneath motif F is a channel that appears able to accommodate single-stranded nucleic acid. The analogous structural arrangement leads us to propose that the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp may backtrack, generating a single-stranded RNA segment at the 3′ end that would extrude out the RdRp secondary channel ( Figure 5 B).

Section: Discussion

We have established that the critical SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription components nsp13 and holo-RdRp form a stable complex ( Figures 1 B and 1C) and determined a nominal 3.5-Å-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction ( Figure 2 ; Figure S4 ; Table S1 ; Video S1 ). In the structure, the primary interaction determinant of the helicase with the RTC occurs between the nsp13-ZBDs and the nsp8 extensions. These structural elements are unique to nidoviruses, and the interaction interfaces are conserved within α- and β-CoV genera ( Figure 3 ), indicating that this interaction is a crucial facet of SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription. A protein-protein interaction analysis of the SARS-CoV-1 ORFeome (which recapitulates the nsp13-RTC interactions observed in our structure) identified nsp8 as a central hub for viral protein-protein interactions ( von Brunn et al., 2007 90. von Brunn, A. ∙ Teepe, C. ∙ Simpson, J.C. ... Analysis of intraviral protein-protein interactions of the SARS coronavirus ORFeome PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 :e459 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structural architecture of nsp8a and nsp8b, with their long N-terminal helical extensions, provide a large binding surface for association of an array of replication-transcription factors ( Figures 2 C and 2E).

Structural Overview of the nsp13 2 -RTC Complex, Related to Figure 2 The video highlights features of the nsp13 2 -RTC. The video starts with the experimental nsp13 2 -RTC cryo-EM map [3.5 Å nominal resolution, local-resolution filtered (Cardone et al., 2013)], superimposes the holo-RdRp:RNA structure, nsp13.1, then nsp13.2. Structural features highlighted through the video include: 1)The nsp13.1:holo-RdRp interface, 2) the nsp13.2-nsp8a interface, 3) the ADP-Mg 2+ bound in the nsp12-NiRAN domain, and 4) the RdRp secondary channel.
Our structure reveals ADP-Mg 2+ occupying the NiRAN domain active site ( Figure 4 C), presumably because the sample was incubated with ADP-AlF 3 prior to grid preparation. The ADP makes no base-specific interactions with the protein; nsp12-NiRAN-H75 forms a cation-π interaction with the adenine base ( Figure 4 C), but this interaction is not expected to be strongly base specific, and structural modeling does not suggest obvious candidates for base-specific interactions. The position corresponding to H75 in the NiRAN domain A n alignment is not conserved ( Figure 4 A), suggesting that (1) this residue is not a determinant of base specificity for the NiRAN domain active site, (2) the NiRAN domain base specificity varies among different nidoviruses, or (3) NiRAN domains in general do not show base specificity in their activity. The NiRAN domain of the EAV-RdRp appeared to prefer U or G for its activity ( Lehmann et al., 2015a 49. Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Gulyaeva, A. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J.C. ... Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :8416-8434 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). NiRAN domain enzymatic activity is essential for viral propagation, but its target is unknown ( Lehmann et al., 2015a 49. Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Gulyaeva, A. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J.C. ... Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :8416-8434 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further experiments will be required to more completely understand NiRAN domain activity, its preferred substrate, and its in vivo targets, and these may vary among different nidoviruses. Our results provide a structural basis for (1) biochemical, biophysical, and genetic experiments to investigate these questions and (2) a platform for anti-viral therapy development.
Our analysis comparing the viral RdRp with cellular DdRps revealed a remarkable structural similarity at the polymerase active sites; immediately downstream of each polymerase active site is a conserved structural element that divides the active site cleft into two compartments, directing the downstream nucleic acid template into one compartment and leaving a relatively open channel (the secondary channel) in the other compartment ( Figure 5 ). In the cellular DdRps, the conserved structural element that divides the active site cleft is the bridge helix ( Lane and Darst, 2010 47. Lane, W.J. ∙ Darst, S.A. Molecular evolution of multisubunit RNA polymerases: structural analysis J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395 :686-704 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the secondary channel serves to allow NTP substrates to access the DdRp active site and to also accommodate the single-stranded 3′-RNA fragment generated during backtracking ( Figure 5 A).
In the viral RdRp, the downstream strand-separating structural element is the motif F β-hairpin loop. As for multi-subunit DdRps, the RdRp secondary channel is perfectly positioned to accommodate backtracked RNA ( Figure 5 B). Based on this structural analogy, we propose that the viral RdRp may undergo backtracking and that the single-stranded 3′-RNA fragment so generated would extrude out the viral RdRp secondary channel ( Figure 5 B). Backtracking of Φ6 and poliovirus RdRps has been observed experimentally ( Dulin et al., 2015 24. Dulin, D. ∙ Vilfan, I.D. ∙ Berghuis, B.A. ... Backtracking behavior in viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase provides the basis for a second initiation site Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :10421-10429 PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 25. Dulin, D. ∙ Arnold, J.J. ∙ van Laar, T. ... Signatures of Nucleotide Analog Incorporation by an RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Revealed Using High-Throughput Magnetic Tweezers Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :1063-1076 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Ignoring sequence variation, the energetics of backtracking by cellular DdRps are close to neutral because the size of the melted transcription bubble and the length of the RNA/DNA hybrid in the active site cleft are maintained (any base pairs disrupted by backtracking are recovered somewhere else). For the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, the arrangement of single-stranded and duplex nucleic acids during replication-transcription in vivo is not known, but in vitro , the RdRp synthesizes product RNA (p-RNA) from a single-stranded t-RNA, resulting in a persistent upstream p-RNA/t-RNA hybrid. In this case, backtracking is energetically disfavored because it only shortens the product RNA duplex without recovering duplex nucleic acids somewhere else. However, our structural analysis of the nsp13-RTC indicates that nsp13.1 can engage with the downstream single-stranded t-RNA ( Figure 2 D; Figure S6 C). Translocation of the helicase on this RNA strand would proceed in the 5′ > 3′ direction, in opposition to the 3′ > 5′ translocation of the RdRp on the same RNA strand. This aspect of helicase function could provide the NTP-dependent motor activity necessary to backtrack the RdRp. In cellular organisms, DdRp backtracking plays important roles in many processes, including control of pausing during transcription elongation, termination, DNA repair, and fidelity ( Nudler, 2012 56. Nudler, E. RNA polymerase backtracking in gene regulation and genome instability Cell. 2012; 149 :1438-1445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two potential roles of backtracking in SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription include (1) fidelity and (2) template switching during sub-genomic transcription.
Backtracking by cellular DdRps is favored when base-pairing in the RNA/DNA hybrid is weakened by a misincorporated nucleotide in the RNA transcript ( Nudler et al., 1997 57. Nudler, E. ∙ Mustaev, A. ∙ Lukhtanov, E. ... The RNA-DNA hybrid maintains the register of transcription by preventing backtracking of RNA polymerase Cell. 1997; 89 :33-41 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacterial Gre factors or eukaryotic SII (transcription factor IIS, or TFIIS) interact with the backtracked DdRp complex and stimulate endonucleolytic cleavage of the single-stranded 3′-RNA fragment, removing the misincorporated nucleotide and generating a new 3′-OH at the DdRp active site for transcription to resume ( Borukhov et al., 1993 9.

In vitro , nsp14 3′ > 5′ ExoN activity can efficiently cleave a mismatched 3′ end from an RNA construct thought to mimic an RdRp misincorporation product ( Bouvet et al., 2012 11.

USA. 2014; 111 :E3900-E3909 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ), but structural modeling shows that the ExoN active site would not be able to access a mismatched 3′ end in the RdRp active site, which is too narrow to accommodate the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN domain proofreading machinery, a nearly 50-kDa protein. We propose that nsp14 may bind to the holo-RdRp with its ExoN active site at the mouth of the RdRp secondary channel, where it would be encountered by the backtracked mismatched RNA 3′ end. Helicase-powered backtracking could thus play a role in maintaining replication-transcription fidelity by extruding the mismatched RNA 3′ end into the nsp14 ExoN active site for cleavage.
Roadblocks to forward translocation of the cellular DdRps can also induce backtracking ( Nudler, 2012 56. Nudler, E. RNA polymerase backtracking in gene regulation and genome instability Cell. 2012; 149 :1438-1445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remdesivir (Rdv) is an adenosine nucleoside triphosphate analog that has been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration ( US Food and Drug Administration, 2020 86. US Food and Drug Administration Remdesivir EUA Letter of Authorization 2020 Remdesivir-EUA-Letter-Of-Authorization.pdf Google Scholar ; Warren et al., 2016 93.

Therapeutic efficacy of the small molecule GS-5734 against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys Nature. 2016; 531 :381-385 Crossref Scopus (1169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rdv is incorporated into the p-RNA by the RdRp and appears to act by a delayed chain termination mechanism; up to three nucleotides can be added following Rdv incorporation until further forward translocation is stalled ( Gordon et al., 2020 33. Gordon, C.J. ∙ Tchesnokov, E.P. ∙ Woolner, E. ... Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with high potency J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 :6785-6797 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (719) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rdv incorporated into the −4 position of the RNA duplex would not be accessible by nsp14 ExoN activity, but CoV mutants lacking nsp14 ExoN activity are more sensitive to Rdv ( Agostini et al., 2018 5. Agostini, M.L. ∙ Andres, E.L. ∙ Sims, A.C. ... Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease MBio. 2018; 9 e00221–e18 Crossref Scopus (1049) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that nsp14 ExoN activity can blunt the effectiveness of the drug ( Shannon et al., 2020 73. Shannon, A. ∙ Le, N.T.T. ∙ Selisko, B. ... Remdesivir and SARS-CoV-2: Structural requirements at both nsp12 RdRp and nsp14 Exonuclease active-sites Antiviral Res. 2020; 178 :104793 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nsp14 ExoN proofreading activity to excise Rdv could be facilitated by backtracking, which would allow nsp14 to degrade the p-RNA from the 3′ end until Rdv is removed.
The efficiency with which the holo-RdRp can negotiate downstream obstacles to elongation is unknown. Our structure suggests that the nsp13 helicase could act in the 5′ > 3′ direction on the tRNA to disrupt stable RNA secondary structures or downstream RNA binding proteins ( Figure 6 B), both of which could be significant impediments to RNA elongation ( Figure 6 B). The helicase may function in this role distributively to avoid interfering with RdRp translocation. Alternatively, in the case of a fully duplex RNA template, the helicase could act processively to unwind the downstream duplex RNA, much like replicative helicases, such as DnaB in Escherichia coli , processively unwind the DNA duplex in front of the replicative DNA polymerase ( Kaplan and O’Donnell, 2002 42. Kaplan, D.L. ∙ O’Donnell, M. DnaB drives DNA branch migration and dislodges proteins while encircling two DNA strands Mol. Cell. 2002; 10 :647-657 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, CoV transcription includes a discontinuous step during production of sub-genomic RNAs (sg-transcription; Figure 6 C) that involves a remarkable template-switching step unique to nidoviruses ( Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998 67. Sawicki, S.G. ∙ Sawicki, D.L. A new model for coronavirus transcription Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 440 :215-219 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). The process produces sgRNAs that are 5′- and 3′ co-terminal with the virus genome. In this process, transcription initiates from the 3′ poly(A) tail of the + strand RNA genome (cyan RNA in Figure 6 C(i)). Transcription proceeds until one of several transcription-regulating sequences (TRS-R; orange in Figure 6 C) is encountered and transcribed (transcribed cTRS in yellow), resulting in stalling of the RTC ( Alonso et al., 2002 6. Alonso, S. ∙ Izeta, A. ∙ Sola, I. ... Transcription regulatory sequences and mRNA expression levels in the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus J. Virol. 2002; 76 :1293-1308 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could allow engagement of the helicase with the tRNA ( Figure 6 C(ii)). The complement to the TRS synthesized at the 3′ end of the p-RNA (cTRS, yellow) is complementary to another TRS near the 5′ leader of the genome (TRS-L, orange; 5′ leader, magenta), and the template switching depends on complete base-pair complementarity between cTRS and TRS-L ( Alonso et al., 2002 6. Alonso, S. ∙ Izeta, A. ∙ Sola, I. ... Transcription regulatory sequences and mRNA expression levels in the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus J. Virol. 2002; 76 :1293-1308 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pasternak et al., 2001 60. Pasternak, A.O. ∙ van den Born, E. ∙ Spaan, W.J.M. ... Sequence requirements for RNA strand transfer during nidovirus discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis EMBO J. 2001; 20 :7220-7228 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zúñiga et al., 2004 105. Zúñiga, S. ∙ Sola, I. ∙ Alonso, S. ... Sequence motifs involved in the regulation of discontinuous coronavirus subgenomic RNA synthesis J. Virol. 2004; 78 :980-994 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the 6-nt core sequence of cTRS must be available to base-pair with TRS-L ( Figure 6 D(iv)), which could be made possible by helicase-induced backtracking of the RTC to extrude the cTRL at the p-RNA 3′ end ( Figure 6 D(iii)). Upon backtracking, the exposed cTRS could form Watson-Crick base pairs with the complementary TRS-L ( Figure 6 D(iv)). Following hybridization of cTRS with TRS-L, a second holo-RdRp complex (holo-RdRp2) could load onto the free 3′ end of cTRS at the ∼6-bp RNA/RNA hybrid and continue transcription of the 5′ leader ( Figure 6 D(v)), explaining how template switching may occur. The 6-bp hybrid between TRS-L and cTRS is exactly the length of the t-RNA/p-RNA duplex contacted by the nsp12 subunit of the holo-RdRp (−1 to −7; Figure 1 A) and is probably what is required for a minimally stable holo-RdRp:RNA complex. Continued translocation of the helicase on the first RTC might processively backtrack the complex and unwind the p-RNA/t-RNA hybrid left in the wake of the RTC ( Figure 6 D(v)).
The various possible functional modes of nsp13 (illustrated in Figure 6 ) would not necessarily operate simultaneously but could be regulated by other components of the RTC (not shown in Figure 6 ). Thus, the role of nsp13 in facilitating RTC elongation on a single-stranded RNA template ( Figure 6 A, top), where nsp13 must function distributively, may involve the nsp13 1 -RTC (binding of other RTC components to the nsp8a extension could block binding of nsp13.2, for instance). Nsp13 could function processively to facilitate RTC elongation on a duplex RNA template ( Figure 6 B, bottom), and this could involve the nsp13 2 -RTC. The backtracking function of nsp13 in the context of sg-transcription ( Figure 6 C) could be facilitated by pausing, stalling, or inactivation of the RdRp at the TRS, which might be controlled by components of the protein complex presumed to be associated with TRS sequences ( Enjuanes et al., 2006 29. Enjuanes, L. ∙ Almazán, F. ∙ Sola, I. ... Biochemical aspects of coronavirus replication and virus-host interaction Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60 :211-230 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ; Snijder et al., 2016 77. Snijder, E.J. ∙ Decroly, E. ∙ Ziebuhr, J. The Nonstructural Proteins Directing Coronavirus RNA Synthesis and Processing Adv. Virus Res. 2016; 96 :59-126 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sola et al., 2015 78. Sola, I. ∙ Almazán, F. ∙ Zúñiga, S. ... Continuous and Discontinuous RNA Synthesis in Coronaviruses Annu. Rev. Virol. 2015; 2 :265-288 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to nidoviruses, many RNA viruses, including important pathogens such as chikungunya virus, herpesvirus, hepatitis C, Zika virus, and picornaviruses, encode their own helicases ( Lehmann et al., 2015b 50. Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Snijder, E.J. ∙ Posthuma, C.C. ... What we know but do not understand about nidovirus helicases Virus Res. 2015; 202 :12-32 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these viral helicases belong to different helicase families and play different and complex roles in viral life cycles, they all have three things in common: (1) the helicases are essential for viral propagation, (2) very little is known about the precise mechanistic roles of the helicases in viral life cycles, and (3) the helicases are thought to function as components of larger macromolecular assemblies. Our structure provides important clues regarding the role of the nsp13-RTC in SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription ( Figure 6 ) and provides guiding principles to test the roles of the essential helicases in other RNA viruses.
The proposal that the holo-RdRp backtracks is based on structural analysis ( Figure 5 ) and needs to be verified experimentally. Following from this, the implications of backtracking by the holo-RdRp in nsp10/nsp14-mediated proofreading and template switching during sg-transcription ( Figure 6 D(iii–v)) need to be further investigated in vitro (when possible) or in vivo . Finally, the proposed roles of nsp13 in facilitating holo-RdRp elongation through obstacles ( Figure 6 B) also need to be experimentally verified.

nsp7, nsp8, nsp12, and nsp13 are proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
For nsp7/nsp8 expression, Eco BL21(DE3) [ Eco str. B F – ompT gal dcm lon hsdS B ( r B – m B – ) λ(DE3 [ lacI lacUV5 - T7p07 ind1 sam7 nin5 ]) [ malB + ] K-12 (λ S )] were transformed and grown overnight on LB-agar plates containing 50 μg/mL streptomycin (Strep). Single colonies were used to inoculate LB/Strep media and grown overnight at 37°C. Two-liter flasks of LB/Strep were inoculated with 25 mL of overnight culture and ZnCl 2 (10 μM final). Cells were grown at 30°C, induced at 0.6 OD 600 by the addition of isopropyl β- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 0.1 mM final), then incubated for 14 hr at 16°C.
For nsp12 expression, Eco BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP [ Eco B F – ompT hsdS ( r B – m B – ) dcm + Tet r gal λ(DE3) endA Hte [ argU proL Cam r ] (Agilent) were transformed and grown overnight on LB-agar plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin (KAN) and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol (CAM). Single colonies were used to inoculate LB/KAN/CAM media and grown overnight at 37°C. Two-liter flasks of LB/KAN/CAM were inoculated with 20 mL of overnight culture and ZnCl 2 (10 μM final).

The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table S2 . All constructs were verified by sequencing (GeneWiz).
The coding sequences of the E. coli codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 genes (gBlocks from Integrated DNA Technologies) were cloned into a pCDFDuet-1 vector (Novagen). Nsp7 bore an N-terminal His 6 -tag that was cleavable with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was derived from the supernatant of propagated Vero E6 cells and provided by B.R. tenOever ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020 8. Blanco-Melo, D. ∙ Nilsson-Payant, B.E. ∙ Liu, W.-C. ... Imbalanced Host Response to SARS-CoV-2 Drives Development of COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 181 :1036-1045.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2976) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sequence encoding nsp12 was reverse transcribed into cDNA using gene-specific primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher). The ORF1a/1b programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift that naturally occurs during ORF1b translation was corrected to express the nsp12 open reading frame without frameshift using the following forward primer 5′-TCAGCTGATGCACAATCGTTTTTAAA C CGGGTTTGCGGTGTAAG-3′ (the correction is underlined). The SARs-CoV-2 nsp12 coding sequence was subsequently cloned into a modified pRSFDuet-1 vector (Novagen) bearing an N-terminal His 6 -SUMO-tag which is cleavable by the ubiquitin-like protease (ULP1).
The OptimumGene method was used to optimize the sequence full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase sequence for insect cell expression. The gene was synthesized and cloned into the pet28(a)+ vector, using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, by Genescript. We then performed mutagenesis using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Agilent) to insert an HRV-3C (PreScission) protease cleavage site and remove the thrombin cleavage site.
The pRSFDuet-1 plasmid expressing His 6 -SUMO-nsp12 was transformed into Eco BL21-CodonPlus cells (Agilent) and grown overnight on LB-agar plates containing 50 μg/mL KAN and 25 μg/mL CAM. Single colonies were used to inoculate LB/KAN/CAM media and grown overnight at 37°C. Two-liter flasks of LB/KAN/CAM were inoculated with 20 mL of overnight culture and ZnCl 2 (10 μM final). Cells were grown at 37°C, induced at 0.6 OD 600 by the addition of IPTG (0.1 mM final), then incubated for 16 hr at 16°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 μM ZnCl 2 , 1x complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC, Roche), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and lysed in a continuous-flow French press (Avestin). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, then loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), and eluted using a gradient from 0.1 M to 1 M NaCl in TGED buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT]. The fractions containing nsp12 were pooled and loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), washed, and eluted with Nickel elution buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 250 mM imidazole, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (BME)]. Eluted nsp12 was dialyzed overnight into dialysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM BME] in the presence of His 6 -Ulp1 SUMO protease to cleave the His 6 -SUMO tag. Cleaved nsp12 was again passed through the HisTrap HP column and the flow-through was collected, concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon), and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Hiload 16/600 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) that was equilibrated with gel filtration buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM DTT]. Purified nsp12 was put into storage buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM DTT], aliquoted, flash frozen with liquid N 2 , and stored at −80°C.
The pCDFduet plasmid expressing His 6- nsp7/8 was transformed into Eco BL21 (DE3) and grown overnight on LB-agar plates containing 50 μg/mL Strep. Single colonies were used to inoculate LB/Strep media and grown overnight at 37°C. Two-liter flasks of LB/Strep were inoculated with 25 mL of overnight culture and ZnCl 2 (10 μM final). Cells were grown at 30°C, induced at 0.6 OD 600 by the addition of IPTG (0.1 mM final), then incubated for 14 hr at 16°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM BME, 10 μM ZnCl 2 , 1x PIC (Roche), 1 mM PMSF, and lysed in a continuous-flow French press (Avestin). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, then loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), washed, and eluted with Nickel elution buffer. Eluted nsp7/8 was dialyzed overnight into dialysis buffer in the presence of His 6 -Prescission Protease to cleave His 6 -tag. Cleaved nsp7/8 was passed through the HisTrap HP column and the flow-through was collected, concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon), and loaded onto a Superdex 75 Hiload 16/600 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) that was equilibrated with gel filtration buffer. Purified nsp7/8 was put into storage buffer, aliquoted, flash frozen with liquid N 2 , and stored at −80°C.
The pet28 plasmid expressing His 6 -nsp13 was transformed into Eco Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) and grown overnight on LB-agar plates containing 50 μg/mL KAN and 25 μg/mL CAM. Single colonies were used to inoculate LB/KAN/CAM media and grown overnight at 37°C. Two-liter flasks of LB/KAN/CAM were inoculated with 25 mL of overnight culture. Cells were grown at 37°C, induced at 0.7 OD 600 by the addition of IPTG (0.2 mM final), then incubated for 17 hr at 16°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM BME, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM PMSF] and lysed in a continuous-flow French press (Avestin). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, then loaded onto a HisTrap HP column, washed, and eluted with Nickel elution buffer + 1 mM ATP. Eluted nsp13 was dialyzed overnight into 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM BME in the presence of His 6 -Prescission Protease to cleave the His 6 -tag. Cleaved nsp13 was passed through a HisTrap HP column and the flow-through was collected, concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon), and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Hiload 16/600 (GE Healthcare) that equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.0, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM TCEP. Purified nsp13 was put into 25 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, aliquoted, flash frozen with liquid N 2 , and stored at −80°C.
Nsp12 (2 μM) or holo-RdRp (nsp12 incubated with three-fold molar excess nsp7/8 and additional three-fold molar excess nsp8) in transcription buffer (120 mM K-acetate, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM DTT) was incubated with 1 μM annealed RNA scaffold ( Figure 1 A) for 5 minutes at 30°C. Nsp13 (2 μM) was added where indicated. ADP and AlF 3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was pre-mixed and added to a final concentration of 2 mM. Reaction mixtures containing nsp13 were incubated an additional 5 minutes at 30°C. Reactions were run on a 4.5% polyacrylamide native gel (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) in 1x TBE (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) at 4°C. The gel was stained with Gel-Red (Biotium).
The reconstituted RNA-bound holo-RdRp (RTC) and the purified nsp13 were buffer exchanged separately into nMS solution (150 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween-20) using Zeba microspin desalting columns with a 40-kDa MWCO (Thermo Scientific). The buffer-exchanged samples were mixed yielding a final concentration of 4 μM RTC and 5 μM nsp13, and then incubated for 5 min at RT prior to nMS characterization.
For nMS analysis, 2–3 μL of each sample was loaded into a gold-coated quartz capillary tip that was prepared in-house and then electrosprayed into an Exactive Plus with extended mass range (EMR) instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a static direct infusion nanospray source ( Olinares and Chait, 2019 58. Olinares, P.D.B. ∙ Chait, B.T. Native Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Affinity-Captured Endogenous Yeast RNA Exosome Complexes Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 2062 :357-382 Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar ). The MS parameters used include: spray voltage, 1.2 kV; capillary temperature, 125°C; in-source dissociation, 10 V; S-lens RF level, 200; resolving power, 17,500 at m/z of 200; AGC target, 1 × 10 6 ; maximum injection time, 200 ms; number of microscans, 5; injection flatapole, 8 V; interflatapole, 4 V; bent flatapole, 4 V; high energy collision dissociation (HCD), 200 V; ultrahigh vacuum pressure, 6 – 7 × 10 −10 mbar; total number of scans, at least 100. Mass calibration in positive EMR mode was performed using cesium iodide. For data processing, the acquired MS spectra were visualized using Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser (v. 4.2.47). MS spectra deconvolution was performed either manually or using the software UniDec v. 4.2.0 ( Marty et al., 2015 52. Marty, M.T. ∙ Baldwin, A.J. ∙ Marklund, E.G. ... Bayesian deconvolution of mass and ion mobility spectra: from binary interactions to polydisperse ensembles Anal. Chem. 2015; 87 :4370-4376 Crossref Scopus (573) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reid et al., 2019 64. Reid, D.J. ∙ Diesing, J.M. ∙ Miller, M.A. ... MetaUniDec: High-Throughput Deconvolution of Native Mass Spectra J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2019; 30 :118-127 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). The deconvolved spectra were replotted using the m/z software (Proteometrics LLC). Experimental masses were reported as the average mass ± standard deviation (SD) across all the calculated mass values within the observed charge state series. Mass accuracies (indicated in this section in parenthesis after each measured mass) were calculated as the % difference between the measured and expected masses relative to the expected mass. For the reconstituted RTC, we obtained one predominant peak series corresponding to the fully assembled RTC with a mass of 188,984 ± 2 Da (0.008%). When nsp13 was mixed with the RTC, the resulting nMS spectrum showed a predominant peak series corresponding to the supercomplex of nsp13-RTC at 1:1 stoichiometry with a mass of 256,470 ± 10 Da (0.016%). Additional peak series were observed and were assigned to the nsp13-RTC + 490 Da (most likely from one bound Mg-ADP: 454 Da, which was also observed in the nsp13 only sample) with mass of 256,960 ± 10 Da (0.03%), and nsp12 with experimental mass of 106,787 ± 2 Da (0.0017%). The experimental masses of the individual proteins and the RNA scaffold were also determined by native MS and compared to expected masses based on their sequence and known number of zinc ions bound. The following expected masses were used for the component proteins and nucleic acid scaffold—nsp7: 9,739 Da; nsp8 (N-terminal Met lost): 21,881 Da; RNA duplex: 28,681 Da; nsp13 (post-protease cleavage, has three Zn 2+ ions coordinated with 3 His and 9 deprotonated Cys residues): 67,463 Da, and nsp12 (has two Zn 2+ ions coordinated with 2 His and 6 deprotonated Cys residues): 106,785 Da.
In vitro primer elongation assays were performed using a template-primer RNA scaffold of the following sequence: template (5′- CUAUCCCCAUGUGAUUUUAAUAGCUUCUUAGGAGAAUGAC-3′) and primer (5′- GUCAUUCUCCUAAGAAGCUA-3′) ( Figure S1 C) (Horizon Discovery Ltd./Dharmacon) annealed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA. Primer elongation reactions (20 μL) containing 500 nM RNA scaffold, nsp12 (1 μM), nsp7/8 (3 μM) and NTPS (500 μM of UTP, CTP, GTP, 50 μM ATP and 1 μCi α- 32 P-ATP (Perkin-Elmer) were incubated at 30°C for 30 min prior to quenching with an equal volume of 2x stop solution (Invitrogen-Gel Loading buffer II). Primer elongation products were separated on 15% acrylamide-6M urea denaturing gels and analyzed by phosphorimaging.
Steady-state ATPase activity of nsp13 was determined using an NADH-coupled assay as described previously ( Cupido, et. al. 2019 18. Cupido, T. ∙ Pisa, R. ∙ Kelley, M.E. ... Designing a chemical inhibitor for the AAA protein spastin using active site mutations Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15 :444-452 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pisa, et. al., 2019 62. Pisa, R. ∙ Cupido, T. ∙ Steinman, J.B. ... Analyzing resistance to design selective chemical inhibitors for AAA proteins Cell Chem. Biol. 2019; 26 :1263-1273.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, nsp13 (4.4 nM final) was added in the absence or presence of holo-RdRp (4 nM final), RNA (4.8 nM final), or CHAPSO (8 mM) to wells in a black, clear bottom 384-well microplate (Greiner, 781092), along with NADH (175 μM, Sigma Aldrich), phospho(enol)pyruvic acid monopotassium salt (PEP) (1 mM, Sigma Aldrich) and pyruvate kinase/lactic acid dehydrogenase (PK/LDH) enzymes from rabbit muscle (30 units/ml, Sigma Aldrich) in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM K-acetate, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM TCEP, 0.005% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/mL BSA). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 6 μL ATP (concentrations of 3 mM to 3 μM, 4-fold serial dilutions), bringing the total reaction volume to 24 μL. The time course of fluorescence decrease, corresponding to the consumption of NADH, was measured using a Synergy NEO Microplate Reader λex = 340 nm, 440 nm emission filter). The rate of fluorescence decrease was calculated after subtraction of background fluorescence from a control reaction containing no ATP and converted to ATPase rate per second per monomer using an ADP calibration curve. These assays were completed with an n = 2 and two biological replicates of nsp13.
To measure inhibition of nsp13 ATPase activity by AlF 3 , nsp13 ATPase activity was measured using an ATP detection method (Promega Kinase-Glo Plus® kit). The assay was performed in 384-well low-volume white NBS microplates, in 20 μL volumes. Recombinant nsp13 (5 nM) and ATP (50 μM) were added to the assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM TCEP, 0.005% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA and 2% DMSO) and incubated with gentle shaking for 10 min. Following incubation, 10 μL Kinase-Glo Plus® reagent was added to the assay plate and incubated in the dark for 10 min. Relative light unit (RLU) signal was measured on a Synergy Neo2 plate reader (Biotek) in luminescent mode. For inhibition studies, nsp13 was incubated with 0-500 μM ADP:AlF 3 (premixed in a 1:2 molar ratio) for 10 min prior to addition of ATP.
Purified nsp12 and nsp7/8 were concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon), mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio and dialyzed into 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, for 20 min at 22°C to remove glycerol and to allow for association. Annealed RNA scaffold ( Figure 1 A) was added to dialyzed nsp7/8/12 mixture and incubated for 15 min at 22°C. Sample was buffer exchanged into S6 buffer [20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mM K-acetate, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT] using Zeba spin desalting columns. After buffer exchange, the sample was further incubated for 20 min at 30°C and then purified over a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in S6 buffer. The peak corresponding to the RTC was pooled and concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon). Purified nsp13 was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon) and buffer exchanged into S6 buffer using Zeba spin desalting columns, mixed with ADP and AlF 3 (1 mM final), then added to the RTC at a molar ratio of 1:1. Complex was incubated for 5 min at 30°C.
Prior to grid freezing, 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPSO, Anatrace) was added to the sample (8 mM final), resulting in a final complex concentration of 8 μM ( Chen et al., 2019 16. Chen, J. ∙ Noble, A.J. ∙ Kang, J.Y. ... Eliminating effects of particle adsorption to the air/water interface in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy: Bacterial RNA polymerase and CHAPSO J. Struct. Biol. X. 2019; 1 :100005 PubMed Google Scholar ). The final buffer condition for the cryo-EM sample was 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mM K-acetate, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM AlF 3 , 8 mM CHAPSO. C-flat holey carbon grids (CF-1.2/1.3-4Au, Protochips) were glow-discharged for 20 s prior to the application of 3.5 μL of sample. Using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific), grids were blotted and plunge-froze into liquid ethane at 90% chamber humidity at 4°C.
Structural biology software was accessed through the SBGrid consortium ( Morin et al., 2013 54. Morin, A. ∙ Eisenbraun, B. ∙ Key, J. ... Collaboration gets the most out of software eLife. 2013; 2 :e01456 Crossref Scopus (682) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Grids were imaged using a 300 kV Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a GIF BioQuantum and K3 camera (Gatan). Images were recorded with Leginon ( Suloway et al., 2005 81. Suloway, C. ∙ Pulokas, J. ∙ Fellmann, D. ... Automated molecular microscopy: the new Leginon system J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151 :41-60 Crossref Scopus (1231) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a pixel size of 1.1 Å/px (micrograph dimension of 5760 × 4092 px) over a defocus range of −0.8 μm to −2.5 μm and 20 eV slit. Movies were recorded in “counting mode” (native K3 camera binning 2) with ∼30 e-/px/s in dose-fractionation mode with subframes of 50 ms over a 2.5 s exposure (50 frames) to give a total dose of ∼64 e-/Å 2 . Dose-fractionated movies were gain-normalized, drift-corrected, summed, and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 101. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ). The contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated for each summed image using the Patch CTF module in cryoSPARC v2.15.0 ( Punjani et al., 2017 63. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were picked and extracted from the dose-weighted images with box size of 256 px using cryoSPARC Blob Picker and Particle Extraction.
The entire dataset consisted of 10,423 motion-corrected images with 3,691,022 particles (Figure S3). Particles were sorted using three rounds of cryoSPARC 2D classification (N = 100), resulting in 641,026 curated particles. An initial 3D map was generated using cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction on a subset of the particles (128,437 particles from first 3,501 images). Particles were further curated using the map derived from cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction as a template for cryoSPARC Heterogeneous Refinement (N = 6). Class 1 consisted of 88,918 nsp8/12 particles that were further curated using cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction (N = 2) and refined using cryoSPARC Non-uniform Refinement. The final nsp8/12 map contained 88,918 particles with nominal resolution of 3.7 Å. Class 3 and Class 6 were each classified using Heterogeneous Refinement (N = 3) revealing distinct nsp13-RTCs. Class 3.1 consisted of 29,152 (nsp13 2 -RTC) 2 particles (re-extracted with a boxsize of 320 px) that were further curated using cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction (N = 2) and refined using cryoSPARC Non-uniform Refinement. The final (nsp13 2 -RTC) 2 map consisted of 17,073 particles with nominal resolution of 4.2 Å. Class 3.3, 6.1, and 6.2 were combined and further curated with two rounds of Heterogeneous Refinement (N = 3) and sorted using cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction (N = 3), revealing two distinct classes: nsp13-RTC and nsp13 2 -RTC. These classes were further curated using cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction (N = 2) and refined using cryoSPARC Non-uniform Refinement. The final nsp13 1 -RTC map was derived from 31,783 particles with nominal resolution of 3.8 Å. The final nsp13 2 -RTC map was derived from 16,521 particles with nominal resolution of 4.3 Å. Local resolution calculations ( Figure S3 B) were generated using blocres and blocfilt from the Bsoft package ( Cardone et al., 2013 13. Cardone, G. ∙ Heymann, J.B. ∙ Steven, A.C. One number does not fit all: mapping local variations in resolution in cryo-EM reconstructions J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 184 :226-236 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). The directional FSC ( Figure S3 C; Tan et al., 2017 82. Tan, Y.Z. ∙ Baldwin, P.R. ∙ Davis, J.H. ... Addressing preferred specimen orientation in single-particle cryo-EM through tilting Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :793-796 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ) and particle orientation distribution map from cryoSPARC ( Figure S3 D) for the nsp13 2 -RTC particles indicated that the map (and resolution esimations) were corrupted by severe particle orientation bias.
The entire dataset consisted of 4,358 motion-corrected images with 1,447,307 particles ( Figure S4 A). Particles were sorted using cryoSPARC 2D classification (N = 100), resulting in 344,953 curated particles. Initial models (Seed 1: complex, Seed 2: decoy 1, Seed 3: decoy 2) were generated using cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction on a subset of the particles (10,509 particles from first 903 images). Particles were further curated using Seeds 1-3 as 3D templates for cryoSPARC Heterogeneous Refinement (N = 3), then re-extracted with a boxsize of 320 px, and followed by another round of Heterogeneous Refinement (N = 3) using Seed 1 as a template. The resulting 91,058 curated particles were sorted into three classes using cryoSPARC Heterogeneous Refinement (N = 3). Each class was further sorted using cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction (N = 3) to separate distinct 3D classes. Using these classes as references for Heterogeneous Refinement (N = 6), multi-reference classification was performed on the 91,058 curated particles. Classification revealed three unique classes: (1) nsp13-RTC, (2) nsp13 2 -RTC, (3) (nsp13 2 -RTC) 2 . Particles within each class were further processed using RELION 3.1-beta Bayesian Polishing ( Scheres, 2012 68. Scheres, S.H.W. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zivanov et al., 2018 104. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). “Polished” particles were refined using cryoSPARC Non-uniform Refinement, resulting in structures with the following particle counts and nominal resolutions: nsp13-RTC (17,345; 4.0 Å), nsp13 2-RTC (58.942; 3.5 Å), (nsp13 2 -RTC) 2 (11,771; 7.9 Å). Regions corresponding to nsp13.1 and nsp13.2 in the nsp13 2 -RTC map were further refined with cryoSPARC Local Refinement. Local resolution calculations ( Figure S4 B) were generated using blocres and blocfilt from the Bsoft package ( Cardone et al., 2013 13. Cardone, G. ∙ Heymann, J.B. ∙ Steven, A.C. One number does not fit all: mapping local variations in resolution in cryo-EM reconstructions J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 184 :226-236 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). The directional FSC ( Figure S4 C; Tan et al., 2017 82. Tan, Y.Z. ∙ Baldwin, P.R. ∙ Davis, J.H. ... Addressing preferred specimen orientation in single-particle cryo-EM through tilting Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :793-796 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ) and particle orientation distribution map from cryoSPARC ( Figure S4 D) for the nsp13 2 -RTC indicated that the particles did not suffer orientation bias.
For initial model of the nsp13 2 -RTC, the initial RTC model was derived from PDB: 6YYT ( Hillen et al., 2020 36. Hillen, H.S. ∙ Kokic, G. ∙ Farnung, L. ... Structure of replicating SARS-CoV-2 polymerase Nature. 2020; Published online May 21, 2020 Crossref Scopus (548) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the initial nsp13 model from PDB: 6JYT ( Jia et al., 2019 40. Jia, Z. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Ren, Z. ... Delicate structural coordination of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus Nsp13 upon ATP hydrolysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :6538-6550 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). The models were manually fit into the cryo-EM density maps using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 61. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ) and rigid-body and real-space refined using Phenix real-space-refine ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). For real-space refinement, rigid body refinement was followed by all-atom and B-factor refinement with Ramachandran and secondary structure restraints. Models were inspected and modified in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 28. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The nMS spectra were visualized using Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser (versions 3.0.63 and 4.2.27), deconvolved using UniDec versions 3.2 and 4.1 ( Marty et al., 2015 52. Marty, M.T. ∙ Baldwin, A.J. ∙ Marklund, E.G. ... Bayesian deconvolution of mass and ion mobility spectra: from binary interactions to polydisperse ensembles Anal. Chem. 2015; 87 :4370-4376 Crossref Scopus (573) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reid et al., 2019 64. Reid, D.J. ∙ Diesing, J.M. ∙ Miller, M.A. ... MetaUniDec: High-Throughput Deconvolution of Native Mass Spectra J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2019; 30 :118-127 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) and plotted using the m/z software (Proteometrics LLC, New York, NY). Experimental masses ( Figure 1 C) were reported as the average mass ± standard deviation across all the calculated mass values obtained within the observed charge state distribution.
The local resolution of the cryo-EM maps ( Figure S4 B) was estimated using blocres ( Cardone et al., 2013 13. Cardone, G. ∙ Heymann, J.B. ∙ Steven, A.C. One number does not fit all: mapping local variations in resolution in cryo-EM reconstructions J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 184 :226-236 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following parameters: box size 15, sampling 1.1, and cutoff 0.5. Directional 3D FSC ( Figures S3 C and S4C) were calculated by 3DFSC ( Tan et al., 2017 82. Tan, Y.Z. ∙ Baldwin, P.R. ∙ Davis, J.H. ... Addressing preferred specimen orientation in single-particle cryo-EM through tilting Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :793-796 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ). The quantification and statistical analyses for model refinement and validation were generated using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 15. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11087) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ...
