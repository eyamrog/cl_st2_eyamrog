Title: Non-coding 7S RNA inhibits transcription via mitochondrial RNA polymerase dimerization


Abstract: Summary

The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, and altered mitochondrial transcription drives various human pathologies. A polyadenylated, non-coding RNA molecule known as 7S RNA is transcribed from a region immediately downstream of the light strand promoter in mammalian cells, and its levels change rapidly in response to physiological conditions. Here, we report that 7S RNA has a regulatory function, as it controls levels of mitochondrial transcription both in vitro and in cultured human cells. Using cryo-EM, we show that POLRMT dimerization is induced by interactions with 7S RNA. The resulting POLRMT dimer interface sequesters domains necessary for promoter recognition and unwinding, thereby preventing transcription initiation. We propose that the non-coding 7S RNA molecule is a component of a negative feedback loop that regulates mitochondrial transcription in mammalian cells.

Section: Introduction

Physiological needs regulate mitochondrial gene expression, and pathological changes affecting this process contribute to aging and a broad spectrum of human diseases ( Falkenberg et al., 2007 15. Falkenberg, M. ∙ Larsson, N.G. ∙ Gustafsson, C.M. DNA replication and transcription in mammalian mitochondria Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76 :679-699 Crossref Scopus (529) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is circular and consists of a heavy strand (H-strand) and a light strand (L-strand), denoted so due to a strand bias in base content ( Gustafsson et al., 2016 18. Gustafsson, C.M. ∙ Falkenberg, M. ∙ Larsson, N.G. Maintenance and expression of mammalian mitochondrial DNA Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2016; 85 :133-160 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mitochondrial genome's non-coding region (NCR) contains the L-strand and H-strand promoters (LSP and HSP, respectively; Figure 1 A). Transcription of mtDNA is driven by the single-subunit mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), and it generates polycistronic RNA. The polycistronic RNA encodes for essential protein subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system as well as the rRNA and tRNA molecules required to translate mitochondrial genes ( Gustafsson et al., 2016 18. Gustafsson, C.M. ∙ Falkenberg, M. ∙ Larsson, N.G. Maintenance and expression of mammalian mitochondrial DNA Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2016; 85 :133-160 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hällberg and Larsson, 2014 19. Hällberg, B.M. ∙ Larsson, N.G. Making proteins in the powerhouse Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :226-240 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ).
POLRMT is a member of the polymerase A family, which also includes the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase ( Masters et al., 1987 31. Masters, B.S. ∙ Stohl, L.L. ∙ Clayton, D.A. Yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase is homologous to those encoded by bacteriophages T3 and T7 Cell. 1987; 51 :89-99 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of POLRMT can be divided into four main domains: the N-terminal extension, a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain, the N-terminal domain, and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which harbors the catalytic core ( Ringel et al., 2011 51. Ringel, R. ∙ Sologub, M. ∙ Morozov, Y.I. ... Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase Nature. 2011; 478 :269-273 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcription is initiated by the binding of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) to a region upstream of the transcription start site (TSS), inducing a U turn in mtDNA ( Ngo et al., 2011 34. Ngo, H.B. ∙ Kaiser, J.T. ∙ Chan, D.C. The mitochondrial transcription and packaging factor Tfam imposes a U-turn on mitochondrial DNA Nat. Struct. Mol.

Human mitochondrial transcription factor A induces a U-turn structure in the light strand promoter Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1281-1289 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TFAM-DNA complex recruits POLRMT to the promoter, which positions the active site of the polymerase at the TSS ( Morozov et al., 2014 33. Morozov, Y.I. ∙ Agaronyan, K. ∙ Cheung, A.C. ... A novel intermediate in transcription initiation by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :3884-3893 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Posse et al., 2014 45.

The amino terminal extension of mammalian mitochondrial RNA polymerase ensures promoter specific transcription initiation Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :3638-3647 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). A second transcription cofactor (TFB2M) is then recruited, which facilitates the melting of promoter DNA, thus permitting RNA synthesis. After transcription initiation, TFB2M dissociates from the complex, allowing the transcription elongation factor (TEFM) to associate with POLRMT ( Hillen et al., 2017a 21.

TFB2 is a transient component of the catalytic site of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase Cell. 2009; 139 :934-944 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to its role in transcription initiation, TFAM is a key factor for packaging mtDNA into nucleoprotein complexes (termed nucleoids) ( Alam et al., 2003 3.

USA. 2011; 108 :13534-13539 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ), which directly influences levels of mtDNA replication and gene expression in vitro ( Farge et al., 2014 16. Farge, G. ∙ Mehmedovic, M. ∙ Baclayon, M. ... In vitro-reconstituted nucleoids can block mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :66-74 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). In other systems, transcription initiation is a crucial regulatory step in gene expression ( Cramer, 2019 9. Cramer, P. Organization and regulation of gene transcription Nature. 2019; 573 :45-54 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ), and although this is probably the case in mitochondria, its regulation remains unclear.
Recently, non-coding RNA molecules in the nuclear genome have shown diverse functions such as regulating genome organization and gene expression ( Studniarek et al., 2021 57. Studniarek, C. ∙ Egloff, S. ∙ Murphy, S. Noncoding RNAs set the stage for RNA polymerase II transcription Trends Genet. 2021; 37 :279-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yao et al., 2019 65. Yao, R.W. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Chen, L.L. Cellular functions of long noncoding RNAs Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :542-551 Crossref Scopus (1009) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the more compact mitochondrial genome contains little non-coding information. However, it generates a non-coding RNA molecule, 7S RNA, which constitutes a substantial fraction of total mitochondrial RNA in many cell types ( Ojala and Attardi, 1974 38. Ojala, D. ∙ Attardi, G. Identification of discrete polyadenylate-containing RNA components transcribed from HeLa cell mitochondrial DNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1974; 71 :563-567 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). 7S RNA (not to be confused with 7SK RNA, which regulates the nuclear transcription elongation factor P-TEFb) has been experimentally identified in mammals, including humans, rats, and mice ( Chang and Clayton, 1984 8. Chang, D.D. ∙ Clayton, D.A. Precise identification of individual promoters for transcription of each strand of human mitochondrial DNA Cell. 1984; 36 :635-643 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ojala et al., 1981 39. Ojala, D. ∙ Crews, S. ∙ Montoya, J. ... A small polyadenylated RNA (7 S RNA), containing a putative ribosome attachment site, maps near the origin of human mitochondrial DNA replication J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150 :303-314 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as in other vertebrates, including fish ( Jørgensen et al., 2014 27. Jørgensen, T.E. ∙ Bakke, I. ∙ Ursvik, A. ... An evolutionary preserved intergenic spacer in gadiform mitogenomes generates a long noncoding RNA BMC Evol. Biol. 2014; 14 :182 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Its expression is restricted to mitochondria, and there are no published reports about a 7S RNA analog in bacteria or in the nucleus of mammalian cells. 7S RNA is transcribed from LSP and spans the region from the promoter to a conserved sequence element, conserved sequence block I (CSB I), located 180 bp downstream of the TSS ( Chang and Clayton, 1984 8. Chang, D.D. ∙ Clayton, D.A. Precise identification of individual promoters for transcription of each strand of human mitochondrial DNA Cell. 1984; 36 :635-643 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jemt et al., 2015 25. Jemt, E. ∙ Persson, Ö. ∙ Shi, Y. ... Regulation of DNA replication at the end of the mitochondrial D-loop involves the helicase TWINKLE and a conserved sequence element Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :9262-9275 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). It also contains two other conserved sequence elements, CSB II and CSB III, which are located between LSP and CSB I in mtDNA.
The transcript is sometimes confused with the primer for initiation of H-strand DNA replication, which forms in the same region, but 7S RNA likely has its own unique function since it is polyadenylated and not hybridized with DNA ( Gustafsson et al., 2016 18. Gustafsson, C.M. ∙ Falkenberg, M. ∙ Larsson, N.G. Maintenance and expression of mammalian mitochondrial DNA Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2016; 85 :133-160 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). Early reports noted that 7S RNA contains a region complementary to the 3′ end of 12S rRNA ( Ojala et al., 1981 39. Ojala, D. ∙ Crews, S. ∙ Montoya, J. ... A small polyadenylated RNA (7 S RNA), containing a putative ribosome attachment site, maps near the origin of human mitochondrial DNA replication J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150 :303-314 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation led to the suggestion that 7S RNA may alter the structure of the ribosomal subunit and thereby interfere with mitochondrial protein translation.
When the non-coding 7S transcript was initially identified in the early 1970s by Giuseppe Attardi and coworkers, they demonstrated that 7S RNA levels were regulated independently of other L-strand transcripts ( Aloni and Attardi, 1971 4. Aloni, Y. ∙ Attardi, G. Symmetrical in vivo transcription of mitochondrial DNA in HeLa cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1971; 68 :1757-1761 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ojala and Attardi, 1974 38. Ojala, D. ∙ Attardi, G. Identification of discrete polyadenylate-containing RNA components transcribed from HeLa cell mitochondrial DNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1974; 71 :563-567 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). These authors also noted that 7S RNA levels may change dramatically in response to physiological challenges. This notion has received support from later observations in mouse and cellular models. For instance, in knockout mice lacking the mitochondrial single-strand binding protein (mtSSB) involved in mtDNA replication, the overall levels of LSP transcription initiation are dramatically upregulated, but there is a severe depletion of 7S RNA ( Jiang et al., 2021 26. Jiang, M. ∙ Xie, X. ∙ Zhu, X. ... The mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein is essential for initiation of mtDNA replication Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 :eabf8631 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Why levels of 7S RNA change and how this may influence mitochondrial function remain unknown.
Here, we demonstrate that 7S RNA acts as an inhibitor of mitochondrial gene expression by directly targeting and blocking the ability of POLRMT to initiate transcription. Using a range of experimental techniques, including cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we establish the precise biochemical mechanisms and cellular consequences of this effect. We reveal that interactions with 7S RNA cause dimerization of POLRMT, which sequesters key domains needed for transcription initiation. Finally, we show the functional importance of this effect in cultured human cells, and our combined data establish 7S RNA as a key regulator of transcription initiation in mammalian mitochondria.

Section: Results

We have previously reconstituted human mitochondrial transcription in vitro using recombinant proteins (POLRMT, TFAM, and TFB2M) and promoter-containing linearized DNA fragments. In this system, transcription from either LSP or HSP produces a dominant run-off (RO) product corresponding to transcription to the end of the DNA template ( Falkenberg et al., 2002 14. Falkenberg, M. ∙ Gaspari, M. ∙ Rantanen, A. ... Mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 activate transcription of human mtDNA Nat. Genet. 2002; 31 :289-294 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ). Templates with the LSP fragment also produce a short ∼120-nt transcript corresponding to premature termination (PT) at CSB II ( Pham et al., 2006 42. Pham, X.H. ∙ Farge, G. ∙ Shi, Y. ... Conserved sequence box II directs transcription termination and primer formation in mitochondria J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :24647-24652 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It is generally thought that following the formation of RO and PT products, POLRMT dissociates from the DNA template and is then reused for further rounds of transcription. However, from 60 min time course experiments, we noticed that although RO products from HSP templates increased steadily over time, transcription from LSP templates (both RO and PT) plateaued at ∼10 min ( Figures 1 A and 1B). This effect was not due to promoter elements, as substituting LSP for HSP while retaining downstream sequences produced a similar plateau in transcription ( Figures 1 C and S1 A). Thus, the transcription of sequences downstream of LSP appeared to curtail further rounds of transcription.
Based on these initial observations, we hypothesized that the transcript immediately downstream of LSP ( Figure 1 A), which has sequences corresponding in vivo to the non-coding 7S RNA, could be part of a negative feedback loop influencing transcription initiation. Thus, we tested whether adding 7S RNA in trans to transcription reactions could recreate the negative feedback effect by inhibiting transcription. We synthesized recombinant 3′-polyadenylated 7S RNA in vitro to mimic 7S RNA in vivo ( Milligan et al., 1987 32. Milligan, J.F. ∙ Groebe, D.R. ∙ Witherell, G.W. ... Oligoribonucleotide synthesis using T7 RNA polymerase and synthetic DNA templates Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15 :8783-8798 Crossref Scopus (2015) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the presence of 7S RNA substantially inhibited transcription from both LSP and HSP in linear and supercoiled templates when present at levels stoichiometric to POLRMT ( Figures 1 D, S1 B, and S1C). In contrast, inhibition by other RNA species (non-specific RNA, isolated mitochondrial tRNA, and double-stranded 7S RNA) required at least 10-fold higher concentrations to achieve the same effect ( Figures 1 E and S1 D–S1F). Furthermore, 7S RNA did not inhibit transcription by the single-subunit bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase ( Figure S1 G), suggesting that its effect is specific to the mitochondrial transcription system.
Our mitochondrial transcription reactions contain multiple components (POLRMT, TFAM, TFB2M, and template DNA). We reasoned that the target of inhibition among these could be determined based on which component supplied in trans could overcome transcription inhibited by 7S RNA. Out of all components in the in vitro system, only the addition of POLRMT “rescued” transcription, suggesting that 7S RNA specifically affects POLRMT activity ( Figures 1 F and S1 H–S1J). Additionally, the presence of the mitochondrial transcription elongation factor (TEFM), which interacts with POLRMT and stimulates transcription ( Posse et al., 2015 46. Posse, V. ∙ Shahzad, S. ∙ Falkenberg, M. ... TEFM is a potent stimulator of mitochondrial transcription elongation in vitro Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :2615-2624 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not rescue transcription ( Figure 1 G). Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments showed that 7S RNA supplied in trans after initiating transcription did not prevent the synthesis of full-length transcripts, indicating that while 7S RNA blocks transcription initiation, it does not affect transcription elongation ( Figure 1 H).
To investigate whether POLRMT interacts directly with 7S RNA, we performed gel filtration analysis of the two components mixed in a 2:1 molar ratio (POLRMT:7S RNA), as at this ratio, 7S RNA completely inhibited POLRMT activity in an in vitro transcription assay ( Figure 1 D). This revealed a ∼460-kDa species, which eluted at a volume distinct from free POLRMT or 7S RNA ( Figures 1 I and 1J). The specificity of this interaction was verified through RNase I footprinting using 5′-radiolabeled 7S RNA, which showed that POLRMT binds and protects two regions on 7S RNA specifically between nucleotides 10–23 and nucleotides 49–75 relative to the TSS of LSP ( Figure 1 K). The latter site corresponds to CSB III in mtDNA. The addition of TFB2M did not change the footprint pattern. Confirming the importance of CSB III, the addition in trans of truncated 7S RNA constructs lacking the CSB III region or parts thereof failed to inhibit transcription efficiently ( Figure 1 L), whereas 7S RNA constructs lacking CSB I and CSB II showed no reduction in their ability to inhibit transcription ( Figure 1 L). Hence, the inhibitory effect of 7S RNA on POLRMT transcription is driven mainly by the CSB III region.
We set out to investigate the effects of changing 7S RNA levels in vivo . Since human mitochondria cannot be transfected to induce this change, we opted to instead identify factors that increase 7S RNA levels in human HeLa cells. To this end, we performed a 7S RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) imaging screen of 75 genes linked to mitochondrial RNA metabolism and degradation using siRNA knockdown ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). Among the proteins screened, we observed a substantial accumulation of 7S RNA upon depletion of SUV3 (10.45-fold versus siRNA control, Figures 2 B, 2C, and S2 B). Three additional genes, PNPT1 , REXO2 , and ATAD3B , caused a much milder increase in 7S RNA levels ( Figures 2 B and 2C). The SUV3 protein is an RNA helicase, which together with polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase, the product of PNPT1 ) forms the mitochondrial exoribonuclease complex (mtEXO) required to degrade antisense RNA in mitochondria ( Wang et al., 2009 61. Wang, D.D. ∙ Shu, Z. ∙ Lieser, S.A. ... Human mitochondrial SUV3 and polynucleotide phosphorylase form a 330-kDa heteropentamer to cooperatively degrade double-stranded RNA with a 3′-to-5′ directionality J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :20812-20821 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, recombinant mtEXO was able to degrade 7S RNA in vitro even in the presence of POLRMT ( Figures 2 D and S2 C), indicating that 7S RNA may be a bona fide target of mtEXO in vivo .
Fitting with the idea that 7S RNA acts to repress transcription, northern blotting revealed a dramatic increase in polyadenylated full-length and partially degraded 7S RNA (125–220 nt) in SUV3-depleted cells ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S3 A) that coincided with a reduction of other mitochondrial RNA species ( Figures 2 G and S2 D–S2G). Similarly, in organello transcription experiments on mitochondria isolated from SUV3 depleted cells showed a strong reduction in de novo transcription ( Figure 2 H). The mild increase of 7S RNA in PNPase-depleted cells was not accompanied by any effect on other mitochondrial RNAs ( Figures 2 G and S2 G). The more pronounced effect of SUV3 on 7S RNA most likely reflects the multiple and somewhat complex roles that SUV3 and PNPase play in vivo ( Borowski et al., 2013 6. Borowski, L.S. ∙ Dziembowski, A. ∙ Hejnowicz, M.S. ... Human mitochondrial RNA decay mediated by PNPase-hSuv3 complex takes place in distinct foci Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :1223-1240 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2010 62. Wang, G. ∙ Chen, H.W. ∙ Oktay, Y. ... PNPASE regulates RNA import into mitochondria Cell. 2010; 142 :456-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous work suggested that mtEXO catalyzes the degradation of antisense transcripts ( Dhir et al., 2018 10. Dhir, A. ∙ Dhir, S. ∙ Borowski, L.S. ... Mitochondrial double-stranded RNA triggers antiviral signalling in humans Nature. 2018; 560 :238-242 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the loss of mtEXO leading to elevated levels of double-stranded RNA or RNA/DNA hybrids ( Dhir et al., 2018 10. Dhir, A. ∙ Dhir, S. ∙ Borowski, L.S. ... Mitochondrial double-stranded RNA triggers antiviral signalling in humans Nature. 2018; 560 :238-242 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ; Silva et al., 2018 55. Silva, S. ∙ Camino, L.P. ∙ Aguilera, A. Human mitochondrial degradosome prevents harmful mitochondrial R loops and mitochondrial genome instability Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :11024-11029 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we did not observe a significant accumulation of antisense 7S RNA, double-stranded 7S RNA, or 7S RNA/DNA hybrids upon depletion of SUV3 ( Figures S3 B–S3E).
Within mitochondria, RNA accumulates in punctate sub-compartments called mitochondrial RNA granules ( Rey et al., 2020 49. Rey, T. ∙ Zaganelli, S. ∙ Cuillery, E. ... Mitochondrial RNA granules are fluid condensates positioned by membrane dynamics Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :1180-1186 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with this notion, imaging of 7S RNA by FISH revealed evenly distributed, discrete foci (with an average diameter of ∼140 nm) in cells treated with control siRNA ( Figure 3 A) ( Rey et al., 2020 49. Rey, T. ∙ Zaganelli, S. ∙ Cuillery, E. ... Mitochondrial RNA granules are fluid condensates positioned by membrane dynamics Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :1180-1186 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), which in SUV3 depleted cells became ∼12-fold larger (1.65 μm) ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S3 F). As 7S RNA inhibited POLRMT in vitro , we combined FISH imaging of 7S RNA with POLRMT to probe whether this interaction exists in human cells. Here, POLRMT foci showed a relatively even distribution within mitochondria that only partially overlapped with 7S RNA in control cells ( Figures 3 C and 3D). In contrast, most POLRMT foci in SUV3 depleted cells co-localized with the larger 7S RNA granules ( Figures 3 C and 3E). Furthermore, bromouridine (BrU) labeling to visualize de novo transcripts ( Hensen et al., 2019 20. Hensen, F. ∙ Potter, A. ∙ van Esveld, S.L. ... Mitochondrial RNA granules are critically dependent on mtDNA replication factors Twinkle and mtSSB Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :3680-3698 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed that while newly synthesized RNA appeared as discrete puncta in control cells ( Figure 3 F), no newly synthesized RNA could be detected from the 7S RNA granules in SUV3 depleted cells ( Figures 3 F and 3G; Video S1 ). This absence of active transcription proximal to 7S RNA granules is consistent with both the decrease in de novo transcription in SUV3 depleted cells ( Figure 2 H), as well as the inhibitory effect of 7S RNA on POLRMT activity in vitro ( Figure 1 D).

In addition to transcribing mitochondrial gene products, POLRMT also synthesizes RNA primers required for initiating mtDNA synthesis. We observed reduced de novo mtDNA synthesis in mitochondria isolated from SUV3 depleted cells ( Figure 4 A), consistent with the idea that the primase activity of POLRMT is also downregulated by elevated 7S RNA levels. Consequently, steady-state mtDNA levels and the number of nucleoids were also lowered ( Figures S3 G and S3H). Mitochondrial nucleoids also tended to aggregate in larger clusters and associate with 7S RNA foci in SUV3-depleted cells, although the size of individual nucleoids remained unchanged ( Figures 4 B–4E; Video S2 ). These results further substantiate the notion that 7S RNA interacts with POLRMT and blocks transcription also in vivo .

To elucidate the molecular details of 7S inhibition of POLRMT, we used single-particle cryo-EM to reconstruct full-length POLRMT interacting with 7S RNA. The reconstruction, with an overall resolution of 3.3 Å (gold-standard, FSC 0.143), revealed a homodimer of POLRMT, formed by a “head-to-head” interaction with the two POLRMT molecules angled ∼45° relative to each other as measured from PPR-center of the dimer-PPR ( Figures 5 A–5D and S4 ). The dimer interface had a relatively large surface area of ∼1,700 Å 2 and included major contributions from domains that function in promoter recognition (intercalating hairpin, specificity loop, and thumb) ( Figures 5 E–5H). Dimerization also allowed us to resolve the complete thumb and specificity loop regions. In the POLRMT dimer, the catalytic cores of the protomers face each other such that the specificity loop, the thumb regions of the CTD, and the intercalating hairpin of POLRMT protomer-A come into proximity of the analogous elements on the POLRMT protomer-B ( Figure 5 C).
We were able to map a density for 7S RNA that appears to wrap around the interface of the two monomers, but due to poor resolution, possibly due to interaction heterogeneity, we refrained from building a molecular model. In the dimer, two electropositive “valleys” on opposite sides of the dimer interface accommodate interactions with 7S RNA. Each electropositive valley is formed by the CTD of one POLRMT molecule and the N-terminal domain from the second, opposing, molecule ( Figures 6 A–6C).
A previous cryo-EM structure of monomeric POLRMT used a shortened protein construct of POLRMT bound to a compound (amino acids 105–1,230; PDB: 7A8P) ( Bonekamp et al., 2020 5. Bonekamp, N.A. ∙ Peter, B. ∙ Hillen, H.S. ... Small-molecule inhibitors of human mitochondrial DNA transcription Nature. 2020; 588 :712-716 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, as a negative control we determined the structure of apo POLRMT using the full-length construct (amino acids 42–1,230; Uniprot O00411) that is used throughout in this work. The reconstruction obtained (2.9 Å overall resolution, FSC 0.143) showed only the monomer form, supporting that 7S RNA is required for the dimerization of POLRMT ( Figures S5 , S6 , S7 A, and S7B). Structural alignment of POLRMT in the dimeric and the monomeric form showed a high structural similarity overall (global C-α RMSD 0.139 Å) ( Figure S7 E), thus excluding dimerization driven by a conformational change in the structure of POLRMT.
Based on the structure of the POLRMT dimer in a complex with 7S RNA, we mapped nine positively charged residues in POLRMT that are potentially important for 7S RNA binding, then subsequently mutated these residues to alanines ( Figure 6 D). To examine the binding affinity of the mutant POLRMT for 7S RNA, we performed microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments. Our MST results clearly showed that the mutant POLRMT has a much lower affinity for 7S RNA than the WT POLRMT ( Figure S7 F). We subsequently analyzed the mutant POLRMT with 7S RNA by cryo-EM and observed only a monomeric POLRMT structure with an overall resolution of 3.2 Å ( Figures S5 B and S7 C–S7E). These results strongly suggest that the nine residues we mapped are critical for the formation of the dimeric POLRMT-7S RNA structure.
A comparison first between our dimer and apo structures of POLRMT and then between our dimer and POLRMT in the pre-initiation complex ( Hillen et al., 2017b 22. Hillen, H.S. ∙ Parshin, A.V. ∙ Agaronyan, K. ... Mechanism of transcription anti-termination in human mitochondria Cell. 2017; 171 :1082-1093.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB: 6ERP) showed that dimerization blocks POLRMT binding to TFB2M, TFAM, and promoter recognition ( Figure S7 G). Furthermore, the alignment of our dimer structure with that of POLRMT in the transcription elongation state with TEFM (PDB:5OLA) revealed that the binding surfaces for TEFM and DNA are buried in the dimer interface ( Figure S7 H).
Our results thus far suggest that 7S RNA disturbs the formation of the pre-initiation complex at the promoter. To study this effect, we performed DNase I footprinting. As expected, TFAM alone produced a prominent footprint encompassing positions from −40 to −15 of LSP ( Figure 7 B, lane 3). This TFAM footprint was enhanced with the addition of POLRMT and TFB2M ( Figure 7 B, lane 4), indicating the formation of a more stable promoter complex. Furthermore, in the presence of POLRMT, TFB2M, and TFAM, an additional footprint was also observed at the TSS encompassing the −4 to +4 regions ( Figure 7 B, lane 4). These patterns, which have been reported previously ( Posse et al., 2014 45. Posse, V. ∙ Hoberg, E. ∙ Dierckx, A. ... The amino terminal extension of mammalian mitochondrial RNA polymerase ensures promoter specific transcription initiation Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :3638-3647 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicate the assembly of the core transcription proteins at LSP: first, by the binding of TFAM to a region upstream of the TSS, and then by the stepwise recruitment of POLRMT and TFB2M at the TSS, which leads to promoter melting ( Gustafsson et al., 2016 18. Gustafsson, C.M. ∙ Falkenberg, M. ∙ Larsson, N.G. Maintenance and expression of mammalian mitochondrial DNA Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2016; 85 :133-160 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with our assumptions, the presence of 7S RNA indeed abolished the POLRMT and TFB2M footprint at the TSS and −60 to −65 ( Figures 7 B and 7C; compare lane 4 with 7 and 11), indicating pre-initiation complex disassembly. The TFAM footprint in such conditions was also affected, reverting to a cleavage pattern resembling TFAM alone ( Figure 7 B; compare TFAM footprints in lanes 7 with 3 and 4). Thus, the experiments demonstrate that 7S RNA disrupts the pre-initiation complex at LSP, leaving only TFAM bound to the promoter.
Using this system, we then further investigated whether mtEXO could overcome the ability of 7S RNA to block the formation of the mitochondrial pre-initiation complex. In line with our observations that mtEXO can degrade 7S RNA in the presence of POLRMT ( Figure S2 B), the addition of mtEXO to the 7S RNA-inhibited POLRMT restored the POLRMT/TFB2M footprints at the TSS ( Figures 7 D and 7E). A comparable effect was seen when we added bacterial RNase T1, which degrades single-stranded RNA, again confirming that the effect was indeed a result of 7S RNA degradation ( Figures 7 D and 7E, lane 9). Taken together, our results demonstrate that 7S RNA interacts with POLRMT, blocking the formation of the pre-initiation complex, thus selectively regulating mitochondrial transcription initiation.

Section: Discussion

The mitochondrial genome is genetically condensed and produces a highly abundant non-coding RNA molecule, 7S RNA, which is evolutionarily conserved and formed by transcription initiated from LSP ( Jemt et al., 2015 25. Jemt, E. ∙ Persson, Ö. ∙ Shi, Y. ... Regulation of DNA replication at the end of the mitochondrial D-loop involves the helicase TWINKLE and a conserved sequence element Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :9262-9275 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcription from the same promoter also produces polycistronic RNA and short RNA primers for mtDNA replication. Whereas RNA primers remain hybridized to the DNA template as persistent RNA/DNA hybrids (R-loops) ( Posse et al., 2019 43. Posse, V. ∙ Al-Behadili, A. ∙ Uhler, J.P. ... RNase H1 directs origin-specific initiation of DNA replication in human mitochondria PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1007781 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), 7S RNA is not bound to the DNA template and is instead a polyadenylated single-strand species. As shown here, 7S RNA acts as a negative regulator of transcription and preferentially binds to POLRMT. This interaction induces the formation of a POLRMT homodimer such that domains on each monomer involved in both promoter recognition and catalysis interact with one another, precluding interactions with transcription initiation cofactors (TFAM and TFB2M) and promoter DNA. However, once the transcription is initiated, POLRMT is not inhibited by 7S RNA. Presumably, the elongating form of the enzyme adopts a conformation, together with TEFM and the DNA template, which prevents 7S RNA interactions and subsequent dimer formation ( Hillen et al., 2018 23. Hillen, H.S. ∙ Temiakov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Structural basis of mitochondrial transcription Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :754-765 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schwinghammer et al., 2013 54. Schwinghammer, K. ∙ Cheung, A.C. ∙ Morozov, Y.I. ... Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :1298-1303 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results clearly demonstrate that the repressive effect of 7S RNA can be modulated by the mtEXO complex, which degrades 7S RNA both in vitro and in cultured human cells. Degradation is a regulated event, which could allow 7S RNA concentrations to vary in response to metabolic changes. In support of this notion, others have reported that mtEXO activity depends on the length of the poly(A) tail ( Razew et al., 2018 48. Razew, M. ∙ Warkocki, Z. ∙ Taube, M. ... Structural analysis of mtEXO mitochondrial RNA degradosome reveals tight coupling of nuclease and helicase components Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :97 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2014 60. Wang, D.D. ∙ Guo, X.E. ∙ Modrek, A.S. ... Helicase SUV3, polynucleotide phosphorylase, and mitochondrial polyadenylation polymerase form a transient complex to modulate mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylated tail lengths in response to energetic changes J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :16727-16735 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the length of poly(A) tails varies depending on cellular Pi/ATP ratios, which in turn depend on the electron transport chain activity ( Wang et al., 2014 60. Wang, D.D. ∙ Guo, X.E. ∙ Modrek, A.S. ... Helicase SUV3, polynucleotide phosphorylase, and mitochondrial polyadenylation polymerase form a transient complex to modulate mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylated tail lengths in response to energetic changes J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :16727-16735 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this manner, OXPHOS activity could directly affect 7S RNA and levels of transcription initiation. The relative importance of mtEXO for 7S RNA regulation and if other regulatory pathways exist will be an important subject for future investigations.
Non-coding RNA can regulate RNA polymerase activity in systems other than mitochondria, but such mechanisms are distinct from those reported here. In mouse cells, B2 RNA binds to RNA Pol II and assembles into promoter-bound pre-initiation complexes to block RNA synthesis ( Espinoza et al., 2004 12. Espinoza, C.A. ∙ Allen, T.A. ∙ Hieb, A.R. ... B2 RNA binds directly to RNA polymerase II to repress transcript synthesis Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11 :822-829 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is worth noting that a recent study proposed that the dimerization of RNA Pol II in solution may have the potential to inactivate transcription ( Aibara et al., 2021 2. Aibara, S. ∙ Dienemann, C. ∙ Cramer, P. Structure of an inactive RNA polymerase II dimer Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :10747-10755 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). In prokaryotes, 6S RNA regulates transcription by resembling “open” promoter DNA (i.e., during initiation), forming a scaffold that interacts with the active site of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, which effectively prevents promoter-specific transcription initiation ( Wassarman and Storz, 2000 64. Wassarman, K.M. ∙ Storz, G. 6S RNA regulates E. coli RNA polymerase activity Cell. 2000; 101 :613-623 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is in contrast to the case of 7S RNA-induced dimerization of POLRMT reported here, since 7S RNA wraps around the outside of the polymerase, away from its active site. Furthermore, whereas the bacterial 6S RNA remains abundant, the levels of 7S RNA in mitochondria appear to be strictly regulated and drop in response to physiological challenges ( Ojala et al., 1981 39. Ojala, D. ∙ Crews, S. ∙ Montoya, J. ... A small polyadenylated RNA (7 S RNA), containing a putative ribosome attachment site, maps near the origin of human mitochondrial DNA replication J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150 :303-314 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Early studies reported an inverse relationship between 7S RNA transcript levels and those of other mitochondrial transcripts, hinting that 7S RNA could act as a negative regulator of transcription, although the underlying mechanisms were unknown ( Cantatore et al., 1988 7. Cantatore, P. ∙ Loguercio Polosa, P. ∙ Mustich, A. ... Faithful and highly efficient RNA synthesis in isolated mitochondria from rat liver Curr. Genet. 1988; 14 :477-482 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Changes in 7S RNA have also been seen in pathological processes. For example, in skin fibroblasts from patients with disease-causing RNASEH1 mutations, the levels of 7S RNA are upregulated, whereas other mitochondrial transcripts are depleted ( Reyes et al., 2019 50. Reyes, A. ∙ Rusecka, J. ∙ Tońska, K. ... RNase H1 regulates mitochondrial transcription and translation via the degradation of 7S RNA Front. Genet. 2019; 10 :1393 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Non-coding RNA can regulate virtually all steps of transcription in nuclear and bacterial genomes ( Espinoza et al., 2007 13. Espinoza, C.A. ∙ Goodrich, J.A. ∙ Kugel, J.F. Characterization of the structure, function, and mechanism of B2 RNA, an ncRNA repressor of RNA polymerase II transcription RNA. 2007; 13 :583-596 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ; Holoch and Moazed, 2015 24. Holoch, D. ∙ Moazed, D. RNA-mediated epigenetic regulation of gene expression Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16 :71-84 Crossref Scopus (760) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wassarman, 2007 63. Wassarman, K.M. 6S RNA: a small RNA regulator of transcription Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2007; 10 :164-168 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wassarman and Storz, 2000 64. Wassarman, K.M. ∙ Storz, G. 6S RNA regulates E. coli RNA polymerase activity Cell. 2000; 101 :613-623 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we demonstrate direct evidence for a regulatory role of non-coding RNA in mitochondrial gene regulation through the control of mitochondrial transcription initiation by 7S RNA. Furthermore, since abnormal mitochondrial gene transcription is observed in a number of pathological conditions ( Gorman et al., 2016 17. Gorman, G.S. ∙ Chinnery, P.F. ∙ DiMauro, S. ... Mitochondrial diseases Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2016; 2 :16080 Crossref Scopus (982) PubMed Google Scholar ), our work has strong and clear implications for future mitochondrial diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.
Here, we propose that 7S RNA triggers POLRMT dimerization, which further regulates mitochondrial transcription. Although we carried out extensive cryo-EM analysis under a wide range of conditions, we could not obtain a high-resolution map for dimer-bound 7S RNA as it appeared to be conformationally heterogeneous. In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that other proteins besides mtEXO play a part in regulating POLRMT dimerization in vivo . Future studies should be conducted to determine how the mitochondria transduce the signal from the environmental changes to 7S RNA and further control mitochondrial gene expression.

HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; 4.5 g/L glucose, 4 mM glutamine, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells were authenticated by the manufacturer and Eurofins genomics by short-tandem repeat analysis and compared to the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) register of misidentified cell lines (version 10). For siRNA transfections, HeLa cells were reverse transfected with 20 nM of the indicated siRNA (Horizon) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions (typically by diluting 2 μL siRNA stock (20 μM) in 300 μL Opti-MEM and then adding 3 μL RNAiMAX, prior to adding to one well of a six-well plate). Experiments were performed 72 h after transfection. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells used for recombinant protein expression were grown in suspension in HyClone SFX-Insect medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 5% penicillin/streptomycin at 27 °C.
Total genomic DNA from HeLa cell pellets was isolated using a Zymo genomic DNA purification Kit (Zymo: D3024) according to the kit instructions. mtDNA copy number was quantified by qPCR with the following reagents: iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, 1725121) and the gene specific primers (CytB, Nd6, and 18S, Eurofins genomics). mtDNA levels were assessed using primers at the mitochondrial genes CytB and Nd6; nuclear 18S RNA was used as a loading control. Southern blot was also employed to quantify mtDNA levels. Total genomic DNA (2 μg) from indicated cells was digested using 20 U of BamHI (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h and samples were separated in 1% agarose gels. After electrophoresis, DNA was depurinated by incubating agarose gels in 0.25 M HCl for 10 min, washed twice in denaturation buffer (0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl) for 30 min, and washed twice in neutralization buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl) for 30 min. DNA was transferred onto a Hybond N+ nitrocellulose membrane overnight, then cross-linked by exposure to 254 nm UV (200 mJ/cm 2 ). Radiolabeled dsDNA probes were prepared by random primer labeling of gel extracted 7S DNA PCR products using 20 μCi α- 32 P-dATP and a Prime-It II kit (Agilent). Probe primer sequences are presented in the key resource table .
Total RNA from HeLa cell pellets was isolated using TRIzol reagent. RNA levels were detected either by qRT-PCR or by Northern blot. For qRT-PCR, all of the RNA samples were treated with one unit of DNase I (Thermo Fisher) and purified by Zymo RNA cleanup kits (Zymo: R1050). Purified total RNA was reverse transcribed using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad, 1708891). iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix and corresponding primers (12S, 16S, Nd1, CoxI, CoxIII, CytB, and 18S) from Eurofins genomics were used for quantification (Biorad CFX96 PCR system). For Northern blot, electrophoresis of RNA samples was performed either using a 1% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel (for mRNA detection) or a 6% Urea-PAGE gel (7 M Urea; for 7S RNA and tRNA detection). RNA was transferred onto a Hybond N+ nitrocellulose membrane overnight, then cross-linked by exposure to 254 nm UV (200 mJ/cm 2 ). The strand-specific probes and low molecular weight marker (New England Biolabs) were labeled with 20 μCi γ- 32 P-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (New England Biolabs). Radiolabeled dsDNA probes were prepared by random primer labeling of gel-extracted PCR products with 20 μCi α- 32 P-dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using a Prime-It II kit (Agilent).
Freshly isolated mitochondria (1 mg) were resuspended in 1 mL of incubation buffer (25 mM sucrose, 75 mM sorbitol, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 0.05 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ADP, 10 mM potassium glutamate, 2.5 mM potassium malate, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mg/mL fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. For de novo transcription assays, 40 μCi α- 32 P-UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was added into the incubation buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h on a rotating wheel. After incubation, mitochondria were pelleted at 7600 × g for 4 min and washed twice with washing buffer (10% glycerol, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.15 mM MgCl 2 ). Mitochondrial RNA was isolated from the final pellet with TRIzol reagent and separated on 6% Urea-PAGE gels. The products were imaged by phosphorimaging. For the de novo replication assay, 50 μM each of dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP along with 20 μCi α- 32 P-dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were added, and incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h on a rotating wheel. After incubation, mitochondria were pelleted at 7600 × g for 4 min and washed twice with washing buffer. mtDNA was extracted using phenol followed by ethanol precipitation, heated to 95 °C for 5 min to release 7S DNA from mtDNA, separated on 1% agarose gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose Hybond membrane, and exposed to a phosphor-imager screen. Protein extracts from equal aliquots of mitochondria were prepared for VDAC western blot as loading controls.
Cell pellets were incubated in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM pepstatin A, 0.6 mM leupeptin, and 2 mM benzamidine) for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min, retaining the supernatant. Protein samples were separated by gradient (4–20%) SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies.
N-terminal MBP-tagged human POLRMT lacking the mitochondria targeting sequence (MTS; residues 1–42) was expressed in ArcticExpress Escherichia coli cells (Agilent Technologies), and purified as previously described ( Oláhová et al., 2021 40. Oláhová, M. ∙ Peter, B. ∙ Szilagyi, Z. ... POLRMT mutations impair mitochondrial transcription causing neurological disease Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :1135 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Site-directed mutagenesis producing the human POLRMT variant with amino acid changes (R253A, K257A, K432A, K435A, R1034A, K1038A, K1109A, R1113A, and R1116A) was carried out using the QuickChange XL Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing.
TFAM lacking the MTS (residues 1–42) was fused with two N-terminal tags (a His-tag and an MBP-tag) and expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli cells (Novagen), as previously described ( Falkenberg et al., 2002 14. Falkenberg, M. ∙ Gaspari, M. ∙ Rantanen, A. ... Mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 activate transcription of human mtDNA Nat. Genet. 2002; 31 :289-294 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the minor modification that TEV cleavage was performed before the HiTrap™ Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare). TFB2M was expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, as previously described ( Falkenberg et al., 2002 14. Falkenberg, M. ∙ Gaspari, M. ∙ Rantanen, A. ... Mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 activate transcription of human mtDNA Nat. Genet. 2002; 31 :289-294 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ; Posse et al., 2014 45. Posse, V. ∙ Hoberg, E. ∙ Dierckx, A. ... The amino terminal extension of mammalian mitochondrial RNA polymerase ensures promoter specific transcription initiation Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :3638-3647 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). N-terminally His-tagged human TEFM lacking MTS (residues 1–35) was expressed and purified as previous described ( Posse et al., 2015 46. Posse, V. ∙ Shahzad, S. ∙ Falkenberg, M. ... TEFM is a potent stimulator of mitochondrial transcription elongation in vitro Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :2615-2624 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Human SUV3 without the predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (residues 23–786) was fused with a C-terminal His 6 -tag and cloned into a pBacPAK9 vector (Clontech), then expressed in Sf9 insect cells as previously described ( Macao et al., 2015 30. Macao, B. ∙ Uhler, J.P. ∙ Siibak, T. ... The exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase gamma is required for ligation during mitochondrial DNA replication Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7303 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human PNPase lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence (residues 38–783) was fused with a C-terminal His 6 -tag and inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pET-20b, then expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Terrific Broth (TB). At an OD 600 of 1.8, cells were cooled for 15 min at 16 °C and protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 16 °C for 18 h.
For both SUV3 and PNPase, harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM pepstatin A, 0.6 mM leupeptin and 2 mM benzamidine), lysed by subjecting cells to 3 freeze-thaw cycles (frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed in a 4 °C water bath), and the clarified lysate was passed 10 times through an 18 Gauge needle. SUV3 and PNPase were purified by affinity chromatography using an Ni-NTA resin (HIS-Select Nickel Affinity Gel, Sigma Aldrich) equilibrated in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM Imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease inhibitors), and eluting with buffer B (buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole), followed by a 1 mL HiTrap Heparin column (GE Healthcare). Pooled Heparin fractions were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a 1 mL HiTrap SP (GE Healthcare) column. Both Heparin and SP columns were equilibrated in buffer C (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1× protease inhibitors), and proteins were eluted via a 0.2–1.2 M NaCl gradient. Lastly, proteins were purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer D (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.4 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM DTT).
Complex formation between 7S RNA and POLRMT was tested by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) connected to an ÄKTA Purifier (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated in running buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). 7S RNA and POLRMT in complex (1:2 ratio) or individually were pre-incubated in running buffer for 10 min on ice before injection. Samples (500 μL) were injected onto the column through a 500 μL loop and run at 1 mL/min. Fractions of 1 mL were collected and analyzed on a precast 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and visualized using ImageLab™ (BioRad). A size calibration curve was prepared immediately before the gel filtration analysis using thyroglobulin (670 kDa), c-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BioRad, 151-1901). The logarithm of molecular weight was plotted against K av , which was calculated for each protein as follows: K av =(V e –V o )/(V t –V o ), where V e = elution volume for the protein, V o = column void volume, and V t = total bed volume.
In vitro transcription assays were performed as previously described ( Falkenberg et al., 2002 14. Falkenberg, M. ∙ Gaspari, M. ∙ Rantanen, A. ... Mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 activate transcription of human mtDNA Nat. Genet. 2002; 31 :289-294 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ), using either supercoiled or linear DNA templates containing LSP or HSP as indicated. The LSP plasmid was cut with HindIII to generate the LSP template with long run-off transcripts (∼3000 nt). To construct the template replacing LSP with HSP, we cloned mtDNA 561–498 nt (HSP) fused with mtDNA 406–205 nt (CSB I, II, and III) between BamHI and HindIII sites of pUC19 in this orientation. The plasmid was cleaved with SapI to generate run-off transcripts of a similar size to the LSP template used in Figure 1 B. All reactions were prepared on ice. Transcription reactions (25 μL) were set up in Transcription Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 100 μg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM DTT, 0.16 U/μL RNase inhibitor, 50 mM NaCl, 400 μM ATP, 150 μM GTP, 150 μM CTP, 10 μM UTP, and 0.027 μM α- 32 P-UTP (3000 Ci/mmol)). Unless described otherwise, 4 nM of DNA template, 20 nM POLRMT, 40 nM TFB2M, and 200 nM TFAM were used. When indicated, TEFM was added to a final concentration as indicated. Reactions were mixed with 7S RNA or other RNAs as indicated, incubated at 32 °C for 30 min or as indicated, then stopped by the addition of 200 μL Transcription Stop buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/mL glycogen, and 100 μg/mL proteinase K) and incubated at 42 °C for 45 min. Transcripts were purified by ethanol precipitation and the dried pellets were dissolved in 20 μL 2× Formamide loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF and 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue) followed by heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (1× TBE buffer and 7 M urea) and imaged by either exposure to X-ray films (Fujifilm) or through a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All experiments were performed in triplicate and quantified using MultiGauge 3.0 software (Fujifilm).
For pulse-chase transcription reactions, a 20 μL mix containing HindIII-digested LSP template and proteins (15 nM LSP template, 2 μM TFAM, 75 nM each of POLRMT, TFB2M, and TEFM, respectively) was first prepared on ice. The TFAM concentration was chosen to achieve a relative TFAM-to-DNA template ratio of 24 bp/TFAM on the ∼2.6 kb DNA template. After a 2 min equilibration at 32 °C, the pulse step was initiated by the addition of 1.5 μL pulse NTP cocktail (5.73 mM ATP, 2.15 mM GTP, 2.15 mM CTP, 0.14 mM UTP, 2 μCi α- 32 P-UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in Transcription buffer). After a 90 s pulse, transcription reactions were chased for 5 min with the addition of 3.5 μL chase NTP mix (0.4 mM ATP, 1.94 mM GTP, 1.94 mM CTP, 2.8 mM UTP, 1 U/μL RNase Inhibitor diluted with TE buffer) containing cold (non-radioactive) NTPs, to bring the final concentration of all cold nucleotides to ∼400 μM. When indicated, 150 nM 7S RNA (polyadenylated) was added either before the pulse (proteins pre-incubated with 7S RNA), or included in the chase NTP mix. As a positive control to illustrate transcription terminated at the chase step, we substituted the cold UTP with 3′-deoxy-UTP, a transcription chain terminator. Pulse chase reactions were stopped and processed as with transcription reactions described above.
Recombinant 7S RNA was generated in vitro possessing a 3′ end proximal to CSB I as mapped in human cells ( Jemt et al., 2015 25. Jemt, E. ∙ Persson, Ö. ∙ Shi, Y. ... Regulation of DNA replication at the end of the mitochondrial D-loop involves the helicase TWINKLE and a conserved sequence element Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :9262-9275 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). 7S RNA and truncated variants were synthesized in vitro using the HiScribe T7 RNA Polymerase kit (New England Biolabs) using PCR-amplified DNA templates. DNA templates for the transcription of wild-type 7S RNA were amplified from a chimeric DNA construct encompassing nt 16024–405 of the reference genome (rCRS), where up to the +2 residue of LSP (nt 406) was replaced with equivalent residues of the T7 promoter (GCCGCG TAATACGACTCACTATAGG , Bold: T7 promoter; underlined: 5′ GC clamp; red (‘GG’): +1 and +2 positions of the T7 promoter that replace +1 and +2 positions of human LSP) using primers bt19_T7Fa and bt19_aR. Antisense 7S RNA was synthesized from a chimeric DNA template containing nt 407–219 of the rCRS, where the T7 promoter was fused to nt 219 to allow the synthesis of an RNA molecule with a reverse complement sequence of 7S RNA; this PCR template was generated using primers bt20_aR and bt20_aF. PCR was performed using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 3% (v/v) DMSO in GC buffer, and using the primers indicated in the key resource table . PCR-amplified DNA templates of the appropriate size were gel extracted from agarose gels using the QIAEXii gel extraction kit. DNA templates for HiScribe transcription that generate transcripts with 5′ truncations to wild-type 7S RNA were made by PCR using primers complementary to the region of interest, but with the T7 promoter sequence as a 5′ flap to allow transcription by T7 RNA Polymerase (see ‘T7_7S_’ primer series in key resources table ).
Double-stranded 7S RNA was generated by mixing equimolar amounts of ‘sense’ (WT) and ‘antisense’ 7S RNA in elution buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA), heating the solution to 75 °C for 5 min, and allowing samples to cool to room temperature. The DNA template used to generate non-specific RNA was a pET20b vector digested with XhoI, which generates a run-off transcript of ∼192 nt from the T7 promoter contained within the plasmid. Two small RNA fragments (17–26 and 17–36 relative to LSP) were ordered from Eurofins genomics. tRNA (∼80 nt) was extracted from freshly isolated mitochondria in HeLa cells using an RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo), and separated in a 6% denaturing Urea-PAGE gel, and then extracted by the ‘crush and soak’ method.
HiScribe in vitro transcription was carried out with 30 nM PCR-amplified DNA template at 37 °C for 16 h according to kit instructions, treated with 4 U DNase I (Thermo) for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1× DNase I Reaction buffer, and purified using an RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo), eluting with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) supplemented with 1 U/μL RNase Inhibitor (Murine, New England Biolabs). From this, 50 μg RNA was diluted to 50 μL in TE buffer and an equal volume of 2× Formamide loading dye was added, the samples were heat denatured at 80 °C for 3 min, then snap cooled on ice prior to electrophoresis. Products of the appropriate size (∼189 nt) were excised from a SYBR-Gold stained 6% denaturing Urea-PAGE gel and recovered by the ‘crush and soak’ method described in ( Nilsen, 2013 36. Nilsen, T.W. Gel purification of RNA Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2013; 2013 :180-183 PubMed Google Scholar ), purifying recovered RNA using a RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo), eluting with TE buffer supplemented with 0.16 U/μL RNase Inhibitor (Murine). Truncated 7S RNA constructs were synthesized and checked on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (1× TBE, 7 M urea) and SYBR Gold staining, but not PAGE-purified.
Poly(A)-tailing of 7S RNA was performed using E. coli Poly(A) Polymerase (New England Biolabs) with reactions (20 μL) containing 1× E. coli Poly(A) Polymerase Reaction buffer, 1 mM ATP, 10 μg 7S RNA in water, and 2.5 U E. coli Poly(A) Polymerase. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and cleaned up using the RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo). The purity and poly(A) tailing of 7S RNA were checked on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (1× TBE, 7 M urea) and SYBR Gold staining. Samples were stored at –80 °C prior to use.
T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and γ- 32 P-ATP were used to label the in vitro transcribed 7S RNA at the 5′ end. The reactions (25 μL) contained degradation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, and 2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 ), 16 nM 7S RNA, and increasing concentrations of SUV3 (4.8–80 nM) in the presence or absence of 180 nM PNPase. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. For the time gradient experiment, 80 nM of each protein was incubated with 16 nM of 7S RNA substrate for 0, 5, 10, or 20 min. The reactions were then stopped with 2× Formamide buffer (formamide with 10 mM EDTA, 0.025% bromophenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol). Samples were analyzed in 8 M urea/12% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, and the gels were imaged through phosphorimaging.
POLRMT residues 42–1230 (2.5 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM TCEP, 2 mM MgCl 2 ) and 7S RNA were mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. UltrAuFoil® (R1.2/1.3, Gold 300 mesh) or CryoMatrix® holey grids with amorphous alloy film (R 2/1 geometry; Zhenjiang Lehua Technology Co., Ltd) were glow-discharged with 25 mA for 2 min using an EMS 100X (Electron Microscopy Sciences) glow-discharge unit prior to preparation. 3 μL aliquots of sample solutions were then applied to the grids and the grids were vitrified in a Vitrobot Mk IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C and 100% humidity (blotted for 8–10 s, blot force 3, 595 filter papers (Ted Pella Inc.)). Cryo-EM data collection was performed using EPU (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Krios G3i transmission-electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV in the Karolinska Institutet’s 3D-EM facility ( https://ki.se/cmb/3d-em ). Images were acquired in 165 kx nanoprobe EFTEM SA mode with a slit width of 10 eV using a K3 Bioquantum. Exposure was 1.5 s during which 60 movie frames were collected with a flux of 0.9 e-/Å 2 per frame ( Table S1 ). Motion correction, CTF-estimation, Fourier cropping (to 1.01 Å/px), picking and extraction in 300 pixel boxes (size threshold 120 Å using the pretrained BoxNet2Mask_20180918 model) were performed on the fly using Warp ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 59. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to preferential orientation of the POLRMT dimer, we collected a part of the dataset with 10, 20, 25, and 35° stage tilt (see image processing scheme for details).
A total of 42,131 micrographs were selected based on an estimated resolution cut-off of 4 Å and defocus below 2 μm as estimated by Warp. Warp picked 3,851,360 particles based on above mentioned criteria that were imported into cryoSPARC v3.2.0 ( Punjani et al., 2017 47. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 2D classification, 3D classification and non-uniform 3D refinement. After the 2D classification, clean classes with high-resolution features (and with characteristic POLRMT dimer) were retained and used to generate ab initio 3D reconstructions. In total 562,980 ‘clean’ particles were retained after initial the 2D classification, which were processed with C1 symmetry (image processing scheme Figure S4 ). After ab initio reconstruction, heterogeneous refinement was performed taking six ab initio reconstructions and all the picked particles. One class showing dimeric POLRMT features was further refined using non-uniform refinement. This was further 3D classified into four classes (T=10, 50 iterations) using RELION 3.1 ( Scheres, 2012 53. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ). One class containing the maximum number of particles (36%) was reimported to cryoSPARC for further refinement steps. Non-uniform refinement of this class in cryoSPARC resulted in a reconstruction with overall resolution of 3.29 Å (gold-standard Fourier shell correlation coefficient [FSC] at a level of 0.143). In order to get higher resolution structures of the individual protomers (A and B) we performed particle subtraction followed by local refinement (non-uniform). In parallel, the map obtained from the first non-uniform refinement was processed through one round of heterogeneous refinement with one ‘junk’ class. The obtained class containing the cleaned up particles (68%) were processed for 3D variability analysis (filter resolution limit 10 Å, number of modes = 4) and 3D variability display (filter resolution 10 Å, number of clusters = 6). Cluster 0 containing 95,388 particles was processed by non-uniform refinement and showed prominent density for 7S RNA. All CTF refinements were per-particle CTF refinements interspersed with global aberration correction (beamtilt, trefoil, tetrafoil and spherical aberration). See Table S2 for data collection and processing statistics and the respective cryo-EM data processing schemes.
For the POLRMT apo (aa 42–1230) structure, 3 μL POLRMT (2.5 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM TCEP, 2 mM MgCl 2 ) was loaded to cryo-EM grids (UltrAuFoil® R1.2/1.3, Gold 300 mesh) that had been glow-discharged with 25 mA for 2 min using an EMS 100X (Electron Microscopy Sciences) glow-discharge unit. Grids with sample on were then vitrified in a Vitrobot Mk IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C and 100% humidity (blotted for 8–10 s, blot force 3, 595 filter papers (Ted Pella Inc.)). Cryo-EM data collection was performed with EPU (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Krios G3i transmission-electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV in the Karolinska Institutet’s 3D-EM facility ( https://ki.se/cmb/3d-em ). In total, 1,313 movies were collected, motion-corrected in Warp, and imported to cryoSPARC for further processing. CTF estimation was performed in cryoSPARC. Only micrographs with an estimated CTF fit better than 4 Å were used for further analysis. Particle picking was performed with a blob-picker within cryoSPARC. In total, 478,676 particles were extracted with box size of 200 px that were processed to get 2D class averages. Good 2D classes with high resolution structural features were selected to generate three ab-initio reconstructions. This was followed by one round of heterogenous refinement, and the best class, containing 106,784 particles, was further refined. Final non-uniform refinement resulted in a reconstruction of overall resolution 3.0 Å (FSC 0.143).
For the POLRMT mutant structure, POLRMT mutant (2 mg/mL) was mixed with 7S RNA in a 1:3 ratio and incubated on ice for 10 min. 3.5 μL of sample was applied to CryoMatrix® holey grids with amorphous alloy film (R 2/1 geometry; Zhenjiang Lehua Technology Co., Ltd) that had been glow-discharged with 25 mA for 2 min using an EMS 100X (Electron Microscopy Sciences) glow-discharge unit. Grids were then vitrified in a Vitrobot Mk IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C and 100% humidity (blotted for 8–10 s, blot force 3, 595 filter papers (Ted Pella Inc.)). Cryo-EM data collection was performed as mentioned above. In total, 5,683 movies were collected. Motion correction, CTF-estimation, Fourier cropping (to 1.01 Å/px), particle picking, and extraction (in 300-pixel boxes) (using the pre-trained BoxNet2Mask_20180918 model) were performed on the fly using Warp (see image processing scheme for details). Warp picked a total of 600,861 particles, which were then imported to cryoSPARCv3.3.1 for further processing. After 2D classification good classes with high resolution features were kept and four ab-initio classes (C1 symmetry) were generated from these particles. This was followed by one round of heterogeneous refinement, taking one good class map and a bad class map and particles from only the good classes. This resulted in a cleaner set of 289,680 particles, and these were used to refine the map further. Final non-uniform refinement (C1 symmetry) of these particles resulted in a map with an overall resolution of 3.24 Å (FSC 0.143).
The crystal structure of the POLRMT PDB: 3SPA ( Hillen et al., 2017b 22. Hillen, H.S. ∙ Parshin, A.V. ∙ Agaronyan, K. ... Mechanism of transcription anti-termination in human mitochondria Cell. 2017; 171 :1082-1093.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used as a starting model for model building. Structure refinement and manual model building were performed using COOT( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 11. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25430) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Structure figures and EM density-map figures were generated with UCSF ChimeraX ( Pettersen et al., 2021 41. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: structure visualization for researchers, educators, and developers Protein Sci. 2021; 30 :70-82 Crossref Scopus (3755) PubMed Google Scholar ) and COOT, respectively. Please see Table S1 for refinement and validation statistics.
DNase footprinting substrates containing LSP were amplified by PCR using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and primers LSPFP_F and LSPFP_R, from a plasmid containing nt# 1–477 of the reference mitochondrial genome (rCRS) cloned between HindIII and BamHI sites of pUC18 ( Falkenberg et al., 2002 14. Falkenberg, M. ∙ Gaspari, M. ∙ Rantanen, A. ... Mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 activate transcription of human mtDNA Nat. Genet. 2002; 31 :289-294 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ). Primer LSPFP_R was 5′ radiolabeled prior to PCR to uniquely label the template strand of LSP in a reaction containing 1 μL γ- 32 P-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Hartmann Analytic, GmbH) and 0.6 U T4 PNK (New England Biolabs) for every 10 pmol primer, which was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 30 min. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a Microspin™ G25 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare), and the eluate was used directly for PCR assuming 90% sample recovery. PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), and amplicons of the appropriate size (175 bp) were excised from 2% (w/v) agarose gels and purified using the QIAEXii gel extraction kit (Qiagen), eluting DNA with TE buffer. Radiolabeled DNA templates were stored at 4 °C. The counts per minute (cpm) of footprinting substrates were estimated from 1 μL of eluted DNA positioned ∼1 cm from the detector plate of a handheld radiation counter (Contamat FHT 111, Thermo Scientific).
The unlabeled LSPFP_R primer was also used to generate Sanger sequencing ladders from a non-radioactive preparation of the footprinting substrate, using the USB® Sequenase™ Version 2.0 DNA polymerase kit (Affymetrix) with modifications as follows. The annealing step used 2 pmol of PCR-amplified DNA template annealed to 20 pmol of primer LSPFP_R by heat denaturation at 98 °C for 8 min, followed by snap-cooling of the mixture on ice for at least 2 min. The labeling reaction was carried out at 16 °C in the presence of α-dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), used a 1:15 dilution of labeling mix (dGTP), 1:4 dilution of Sequenase, and was supplemented with 1 μL Mn Buffer to amplify the signal of sequences closer to the primer. Sequenase reactions were carried out in thin-walled 200 μL PCR tubes.
Footprinting reactions were prepared on ice, and in a final volume of 20 μL containing Footprint Transcription buffer (25 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.16 U/μL RNase Inhibitor) supplemented with 1 mM ATP, ∼30,000 cpm DNA template, and when indicated, 50 nM TFAM, 200 nM POLRMT, 200 nM TFB2M, 600 nM SUV3 (dimer), and 600 nM PNPase (trimer), with the final concentration of NaCl in all cases normalized to ∼68 mM. In reactions involving the addition of 7S RNA, RNA stocks were first denatured at 80 °C for 2 min and snap cooled on ice for 2 min prior to use.
For order-of-addition experiments involving 7S RNA, radiolabeled DNA templates were either incubated first with transcription proteins in 15 μL of a template:protein complex (in Footprint Transcription buffer supplemented with 1 mM ATP) at room temperature for 20 min, followed by the addition of 5 μL of 7S RNA (non polyadenylated) of varying concentrations (diluted in TE buffer) and incubation for another 20 min at room temperature prior to DNase I digestion. Alternatively, proteins were incubated first with varying concentrations of 7S RNA in 8 μL (diluted in Footprint Transcription Buffer) at room temperature for 20 min, and this was added into 12 μL of DNA in Transcription Buffer supplemented with 1 mM ATP and incubated for a further 20 min at room temperature prior to DNase I digestion. For reactions involving the addition of SUV3 and PNPase to 7S RNA:POLRMT complexes ( Figure 7 D), 16 μL of radiolabeled DNA substrates were first incubated at room temperature for 20 min with transcription proteins either in the presence or absence of 7S RNA (1:1 7S RNA to POLRMT), and in Footprint Transcription buffer supplemented with 1 mM ATP. To this, 4 μL of SUV3+PNPase or RNase T1 (1000 U) (diluted in Footprint Transcription buffer) was added, and samples were incubated for a further 40 min at room temperature prior to DNase I digestion.
All reactions were incubated at room temperature following conditions specified in respective figures, followed by the addition of 2 μL of 60 mU/μL DNase I diluted in 2.5× DNase I buffer with MgCl 2 (Thermo Scientific). Samples were mixed by gently tapping the tubes, and DNase I cleavage was stopped after 2 min by the addition of 22 μL DNase stop buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 1 μg/mL glycogen (Roche)), mixed by vortexing, and incubated on ice. DNA fragments were recovered from the aqueous phase after extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), followed by ethanol precipitation. Pellets were dried at 45 °C under vacuum using a Vacufuge™ Concentrator (Eppendorf), and were resuspended in 10 μL 1× Formamide loading buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 47.5% (v/v) formamide, 0.025% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF), denatured at 95 °C for 2 min, and snap cooled on ice for at least 2 min prior to separation on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels (1× TBE and 7 M urea). Sequencing gels were treated with Fixing Solution (10% (v/v) acetic acid, 10% (v/v) methanol) for 5 min at room temperature before exposure to storage phosphor screens without drying in cassettes with intensifying plates, and imaged by phosphor imaging as with in vitro transcription reactions. Representative images were produced using MultiGauge software, and were taken from duplicate experiments. The 16-bit densitometric scans of DNase I cleavage reactions were also analyzed using Imagequant TL 8.1, where pixel position was converted to molecular weight (nt) using the bands from the T-ladder lane (55–149 nt). Pixel position vs molecular weight assignments were fit to a first order Lagrange curve provided by the software, and calibrated lane profiles from ImageQuant were exported to Microsoft Excel.
To prepare 5′ radiolabeled 7S RNA substrates, in vitro transcribed 7S RNA (non polyadenylated) was first dephosphorylated with 6.25 U Quick CIP (New England Biolabs) for every 10 pmol RNA, in 1× CutSmart Buffer supplemented with 1 U/μL RNase Inhibitor (Murine, New England Biolabs) for 20 min at 37 °C. Dephosphorylated RNA was purified using an RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo), eluting with nuclease-free water supplemented with 1 U/μL RNase Inhibitor, and assuming 90% sample recovery. The dephosphorylated RNA was then 5′ radiolabeled in a reaction containing 1.5 μL γ- 32 P-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 5 U T4 PNK (New England Biolabs) for every ∼10 pmol RNA, at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by heat inactivation for 30 min at 65 °C. Labelled RNA was column purified again, eluting RNA with TE buffer supplemented with 0.16 U/μL RNase Inhibitor. Radiolabeled 7S RNA was stored at −20 °C. The cpm of footprinting substrates were estimated from 1 μL of eluted RNA positioned ∼1 cm from the detector plate of a handheld radiation counter (Contamat FHT 111, Thermo Scientific), and the quality of labeled RNA was assessed on 10% Urea-PAGE gels prior to footprinting experiments.
RNase I cleavage reactions were performed based on the protocol described ( Nilsen, 2014 37. Nilsen, T.W. RNase footprinting to map sites of RNA-protein interactions Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2014; 2014 :677-682 PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples were prepared in 200 μL thin-walled PCR tubes, and multichannel pipettes were used to synchronize cleavage reactions. Radiolabeled 7S RNA stocks were heat-denatured at 80 °C for 2 min followed by snap cooling on ice prior to use. Footprinting reactions were prepared on ice, in a final volume of 15 μL containing ∼30,000 cpm labelled 7S RNA in Transcription Buffer supplemented with 1 U/μL RNase Inhibitor and appropriate protein cocktails. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 2 μL RNase I (∼250 mU, determined empirically per labelled RNA preparation as giving ∼50% cleavage of the full length RNA). RNase I cleavage was stopped after 2 min with 4 μL RNase stop buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 5 μg/μL glycogen). Alkaline hydrolysis ladders were generated by diluting 30,000 cpm RNA to 9 μL in 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and adding 1 μL 1 M NaOH, incubating samples for 5 min at 30 °C. Hydrolysis was quenched with 2 μL 1 M HCl and samples were kept on ice, after which equal volumes of 2× Formamide loading buffer were added. Typically, 1/3 of this volume was run alongside footprints, in all cases diluted to similar final loading volumes per lane. RNase T1 Sequencing ladders were generated by diluting 30,000 cpm RNA in 15 μL T1 sequencing buffer (20 mM sodium acetate (from a pH 5.3 stock), 7 M Urea, 1 mM EDTA (from a pH 8.0 stock)), and denaturing samples at 50 °C for 10 min. Samples were digested with 2 μL RNase T1 (typically 200–500 mU) for 2 min at room temperature, and reactions were quenched with 4 μL RNase stop buffer. RNA fragments from RNase I and RNase T1 cleavage were recovered from the aqueous phase after extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), followed by ethanol precipitation. Pellets were dried under vacuum, then samples were dissolved in 10 μL 1× Formamide loading buffer and separated on 10% Urea-PAGE sequencing gels, fixing and imaging by phosphor imaging as with DNase I experiments. Representative images were taken from duplicate experiments.
HeLa cells transfected with indicated siRNA (Horizon) were plated on 12 mm coverslips (for confocal microscopy) or 96-well plates (for quantitative analysis) for 72 h. After fixation with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, cells were permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h. Indicated primary antibodies were diluted and incubated with cells at room temperature for 1 h, followed by a 1 h incubation with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody. For RNA FISH, pre-hybridization and hybridization were performed in a buffer containing 10% dextran sulfate, 2× SSC buffer, 50% formamide, and 16 ng/μL salmon sperm DNA. Target specific probes were generated using PCR with digoxigenin (DIG)-11-dUTP, purified via CHIP DNA purification kit (Zymo), and added to the hybridization buffer to give a final concentration of 1 ng/μL. After adding the probes indicated, coverslips were sealed with rubber cement and 96-well plates were sealed with PCR plate sealing film, denatured at 60 °C for 5 min, and hybridized at 37 °C overnight. Samples were then washed in 2× SSC buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 2% BSA containing 0.16 U/μL RNase inhibitor, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence staining. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before mounting in ProLong Diamond. For experiments requiring dual RNA/protein visualization, RNA FISH was performed prior to IF.
For bromouridine (BrU) labeling, cells plated on coverslips were incubated in culture medium containing 2 mM freshly prepared BrU for 30 min at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . FISH/IF double staining was performed as described above.
A Zeiss LSM 880 equipped with an Airyscan detector and Plan-Apochromat 63× 1.4 NA oil objective was used for image acquisition. Stack images were acquired in sequential mode with a pixel dwell time of 1.65 μs, a pinhole of 133 μm, a pixel size of 35 nm × 35 nm, and a z-spacing of 160 nm. For super resolution imaging, a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 Structured Illumination Microscope (SR-SIM) and Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC M27 objective were used for imaging acquisition. Stack images were acquired in sequential mode with a pixel size of 40 nm × 40 nm and a z-spacing of 126 nm. Twenty-five frames were acquired to reconstruct one image (5 rotations x 5 phases, with a SIM grating period of 34 μm for both green and red channels) and processed and reconstructed using supplied software (Zen, Zeiss).
Master gain and laser power were adjusted for each set of experiments to avoid saturation and bleaching effects. Imaging settings were maintained with the same parameters for comparison between different siRNA treatment and experimental conditions. 3D images were reconstructed and corresponding videos were generated using Imaris((BitPlane, version 9.5.1).
For quantitative imaging analysis (nuclease treatment), 16 non-overlapping images were acquired for each condition using an Olympus Scan-R microscope with an UPLSAPO 20× 0.75NA objective. At least 500 cells were analyzed for each condition and images were processed using Scar-R analysis software (Olympus). Nuclei stained with DAPI were defined as the main objects using edge detection, and gated based on area, circularity, and mean intensity. Total 7S RNA intensity within 30 pixels (12 μm) outside of each the nuclear area was scored.
For experiments requiring dual visualization of 7S RNA and nucleoids by STED microscopy, FISH was performed prior to immunocytochemistry, by using the QuantiGene ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To visualize 7S RNA in STED, cells were hybridized for 3 h at 40 °C using the human 7S RNA probe (1:250). Cells were then subjected to conventional immunocytochemistry procedures by first blocking unspecific sites in 3% BSA, then by incubating overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies prepared in 3% BSA: mouse IgM anti-DNA (1:250), rabbit anti-TOM20 (1:500). The following secondary antibodies at 1:500 in 3% BSA were incubated for 2 h at room temperature: goat anti-mouse IgM Alexa 594, and goat anti-rabbit Atto647N. Coverslips were extensively washed with PBS prior to mounting with Aqua/Poly-mount (Polyscience Inc).
To confirm probe specificity towards RNA, treatments with RNase T1 and DNase 1 (both at 250 U/mL, 37°C) were performed prior to hybridization.
Imaging was performed using a Leica TCS SP8 gated STED (gSTED) microscope, equipped with a white light laser and a 93× objective lens (HC PL APO CS2 93x GLYC, NA 1.30). For confocal images of 7S RNA and mtDNA, Z-stacks in accordance with the Nyquist sampling criteria were taken by exciting the fluorophores at 488 nm and 594 nm, respectively, and hybrid detectors collected fluorescent signals. Stimulated emission depletion of 7S RNA and mtDNA channels was performed with 592 nm (for the 7S RNA probe) and 775 nm (for mtDNA) depletion lasers, which were aligned prior to imaging. 2D confocal and gSTED images were acquired sequentially with the optical zoom set to obtain a voxel size of 17 × 17 nm. Excitation of 7S RNA and mtDNA was provided at 488 nm and 594 nm respectively, and hybrid detectors collected signal. Gating between 0.3 and 6 ns was applied. Images were deconvolved with the Huygens software. Prior to imaging, microscope performance and optimal depletion laser power were tested as previously described ( Nicholls et al., 2018 35. Nicholls, T.J. ∙ Nadalutti, C.A. ∙ Motori, E. ... Topoisomerase 3alpha is required for decatenation and segregation of human mtDNA Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :9-23.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Linescan analysis of 7S RNA and mtDNA was performed on both confocal and gSTED images using ImageJ. Analysis of nucleoid diameter was performed on 2D confocal and gSTED images by measuring the full width at half maximum (FWHM) using the Adrian’s FWHM plugin from ImageJ, as previously described ( Nicholls et al., 2018 35. Nicholls, T.J. ∙ Nadalutti, C.A. ∙ Motori, E. ... Topoisomerase 3alpha is required for decatenation and segregation of human mtDNA Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :9-23.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Image panels were assembled with Photoshop (Adobe); no digital manipulation was applied except for adjustment of brightness and contrast. Statistical analyses as well as generation of frequency histogram profiles were performed in GraphPad Prism.
The effect of 7S RNA on the binding affinity of human POLRMT was analyzed using microscale thermophoresis (MST). 7S RNA and control RNA were labeled by HighYield T7 Atto488 RNA Labelling Kit (Jena bioscience). Sixteen 2-fold dilutions of POLRMT or POLRMT mutant (0.09–3,000 nM) were made in MST protein buffer (20 mM HEPES-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). Dilutions (10 μL) were incubated with 10 μL 7S RNA-Atto488 (40 nM, non polyadenylated) diluted in MST RNA buffer (20 mM HEPES-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) for 5 min at 24 °C. Samples were analyzed in triplicate using a Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies) with standard capillaries and 60% LED and medium MST power for 30 s at 24 °C. Combined thermophoresis and temperature jump data were baseline-corrected and used to calculate K d , bound state and unbound state in the NanoTemper analysis software(MO affinity analysis V.2.3). Raw data were exported in fraction unbound format and plotted in Microsoft Excel.
All experiments except those specifically indicated were performed three times, and values shown are means ± SD of three replicates. Differences between means were assessed with unpaired two-tailed Student’s t -tests; ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at P < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001, respectively.
