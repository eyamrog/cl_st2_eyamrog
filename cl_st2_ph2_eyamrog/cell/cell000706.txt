Title: WNK kinases sense molecular crowding and rescue cell volume via phase separation


Abstract: Summary

When challenged by hypertonicity, dehydrated cells must recover their volume to survive. This process requires the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SLC12 cation chloride transporters by WNK kinases, but how these kinases are activated by cell shrinkage remains unknown. Within seconds of cell exposure to hypertonicity, WNK1 concentrates into membraneless condensates, initiating a phosphorylation-dependent signal that drives net ion influx via the SLC12 cotransporters to restore cell volume. WNK1 condensate formation is driven by its intrinsically disordered C terminus, whose evolutionarily conserved signatures are necessary for efficient phase separation and volume recovery. This disorder-encoded phase behavior occurs within physiological constraints and is activated in vivo by molecular crowding rather than changes in cell size. This allows kinase activity despite an inhibitory ionic milieu and permits cell volume recovery through condensate-mediated signal amplification. Thus, WNK kinases are physiological crowding sensors that phase separate to coordinate a cell volume rescue response.

Section: Introduction

Eukaryotic cells are constantly subjected to environmental challenges that threaten their fluid volume. During hypertonic stress, cells adapt to volume contraction within seconds by orchestrating a system of ion transporters, channels, and pumps that drive net solute influx, resulting in the obligate reclamation of water ( Delpire and Gagnon, 2018 14. Delpire, E. ∙ Gagnon, K.B. Water homeostasis and cell volume maintenance and regulation Curr. Top. Membr. 2018; 81 :3-52 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). This rapid response, termed regulatory volume increase (RVI), provides a stopgap that gives cells time to synthesize osmolytes and initiate transcriptional programs essential for long-term survival ( Burg, 1995 7. Burg, M.B. Molecular basis of osmotic regulation Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268 :F983-F996 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). RVI is mediated by specific members of the SLC12 family of electroneutral cation chloride cotransporters ( Delpire and Gagnon, 2018 14. Delpire, E. ∙ Gagnon, K.B. Water homeostasis and cell volume maintenance and regulation Curr. Top. Membr. 2018; 81 :3-52 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hypertonic stress activates ion influx via the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1; simultaneously, K-Cl cotransporters (KCCs) are inhibited, blocking ion efflux. This results in the net movement of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions into the cell, which stimulates volume recovery. These reciprocal changes in NKCC1/KCC activity are mediated by serine-threonine phosphorylation of the cotransporters via a common signaling cascade that requires with-no-lysine (WNK) kinases ( de Los Heros et al., 2018 11. de Los Heros, P. ∙ Pacheco-Alvarez, D. ∙ Gamba, G. Role of WNK kinases in the modulation of cell volume Curr. Top. Membr. 2018; 81 :207-235 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rinehart et al., 2009 63.

Sites of regulated phosphorylation that control K-Cl cotransporter activity Cell. 2009; 138 :525-536 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hyperosmotic stress strongly activates the WNKs, and deleting WNK kinases from cells impairs NKCC1/KCC phosphorylation and RVI ( Roy et al., 2015b 66. Roy, A. ∙ Goodman, J.H. ∙ Begum, G. ...

Zagórska, A. ∙ Pozo-Guisado, E. ∙ Boudeau, J. ... Regulation of activity and localization of the WNK1 protein kinase by hyperosmotic stress J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176 :89-100 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, WNK kinases play a key role in coordinating volume recovery during hypertonic stress.
To undergo activation by hypertonicity, WNK kinases must first overcome a major obstacle—the increase in intracellular chloride and potassium concentrations experienced by cells during volume contraction ( Burg, 1995 7. Burg, M.B. Molecular basis of osmotic regulation Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268 :F983-F996 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; O'Neill, 1999 50. O'Neill, W.C. Physiological significance of volume-regulatory transporters Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276 :C995-C1011 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Increases in intracellular ionic strength (including [Cl] i and [K+] i ) potently inhibit WNK kinase activity ( Piala et al., 2014 57. Piala, A.T. ∙ Moon, T.M. ∙ Akella, R. ... Chloride sensing by WNK1 involves inhibition of autophosphorylation Sci. Signal. 2014; 7 :ra41 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pleinis et al., 2021 59. Pleinis, J.M. ∙ Norrell, L. ∙ Akella, R. ... WNKs are potassium-sensitive kinases Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2021; 320 :C703-C721 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that an alternate mechanism must be in place that allows the WNKs to sense cell shrinkage, bypass the suppressive effects of ionic strength, and trigger volume recovery via the NKCC1/KCC system.
The mechanisms by which cells detect volume contraction are poorly defined, but likely involve cytoplasmic processes rather than sensors within the plasma membrane ( Orlov et al., 2018 51. Orlov, S.N. ∙ Shiyan, A. ∙ Boudreault, F. ... Search for upstream cell volume sensors: the role of plasma membrane and cytoplasmic hydrogel Curr. Top. Membr. 2018; 81 :53-82 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Decades ago, investigators proposed that cells adjust their volume not by measuring their cell size per se, but rather by monitoring their cytosolic protein concentration ( Minton et al., 1992 46. Minton, A.P. ∙ Colclasure, G.C. ∙ Parker, J.C. Model for the role of macromolecular crowding in regulation of cellular volume Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89 :10504-10506 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ; Parker and Colclasure, 1992 54. Parker, J.C. ∙ Colclasure, G.C. Macromolecular crowding and volume perception in dog red cells Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114 :9-11 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). According to this hypothesis, cell shrinkage causes cytoplasmic crowding, which is sensed by signaling pathways that coordinate volume recovery. Crowded intracellular environments may exert such effects by driving the confinement of molecules into compact spaces with altered biochemical activity ( Garner and Burg, 1994 23. Garner, M.M. ∙ Burg, M.B. Macromolecular crowding and confinement in cells exposed to hypertonicity Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266 :C877-C892 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, macromolecular crowding can induce the formation of biomolecular condensates—functional membraneless microdomains of the cytosol that form via phase separation (PS) ( André and Spruijt, 2020 4. André, A.A.M. ∙ Spruijt, E. Liquid-liquid phase separation in crowded environments Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :5908 Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar ). Consistent with functional confinement, condensed phases display changes in activity or processing ( Sang et al., 2022 68. Sang, D. ∙ Shu, T. ∙ Pantoja, C.F. ... Condensed-phase signaling can expand kinase specificity and respond to macromolecular crowding Mol. Cell. 2022; 82 3693–3711.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 75. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2171) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thus could coordinate a sensing mechanism that triggers a response to crowding. Indeed, recent work has implicated PS as a byproduct of hyperosmotic stress ( Jalihal et al., 2020 33. Jalihal, A.P. ∙ Pitchiaya, S. ∙ Xiao, L. ... Multivalent proteins rapidly and reversibly phase-separate upon osmotic cell volume change Mol. Cell. 2020; 79 978–990.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). PS can occur on rapid timescales; however, it is unclear whether biomolecular condensates mediate rapid physiological responses that occur immediately after stress, such as RVI.
Hypertonicity drives WNK1 into cytoplasmic puncta, which have long been assumed to be membrane vesicles ( Zagórska et al., 2007 90. Zagórska, A. ∙ Pozo-Guisado, E. ∙ Boudeau, J. ... Regulation of activity and localization of the WNK1 protein kinase by hyperosmotic stress J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176 :89-100 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sengupta et al., 2012 71. Sengupta, S. ∙ Tu, S.W. ∙ Wedin, K. ... Interactions with WNK (with no lysine) family members regulate oxidative stress response 1 and ion co-transporter activity J Biol Chem. 2012; 287 :37868-37879 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we report the unexpected finding that these structures are biomolecular condensates of the WNK signaling pathway that form via PS. These liquid-like WNK1 droplets assemble within seconds, at physiological levels of hypertonic stress, and at native WNK1 protein concentrations. We identify the large WNK1 C-terminal domain (CTD) as the primary mediator of PS, map key regions that confer its phase behavior, and confirm its functional relevance by exploring its phylogenesis and effects on downstream pathway activation, ion transport, and RVI. Finally, we show that WNK1 specifically reacts to molecular crowding in vivo , revealing an intrinsic sensing function that allows it to overcome inhibition by chloride and potassium during cell shrinkage.

Section: Results

WNK1 is a ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine kinase that controls cell volume ( Roy et al., 2015b 66. Roy, A. ∙ Goodman, J.H. ∙ Begum, G. ... Generation of WNK1 knockout cell lines by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2015; 308 :F366-F376 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). During hyperosmotic stress, WNK1 activates, triggering the downstream phospho-activation of its effector kinases, SPAK ( STK39 ) and OSR1 ( OXSR1 ), which directly phosphorylate NKCC1 ( SLC12A2 ) and the KCCs ( SLC12A4-7 ) ( Figure 1 A) ( Zagórska et al., 2007 90. Zagórska, A. ∙ Pozo-Guisado, E. ∙ Boudeau, J. ... Regulation of activity and localization of the WNK1 protein kinase by hyperosmotic stress J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176 :89-100 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schiapparelli et al., 2021 69. Schiapparelli, P. ∙ Pirman, N.L. ∙ Mohler, K. ... Phosphorylated WNK kinase networks in recoded bacteria recapitulate physiological function Cell Rep. 2021; 36 :109416 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). While NKCC1 phosphorylation by the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway is activating, phosphorylation of the KCCs by the same pathway is inhibitory ( de Los Heros et al., 2018 11. de Los Heros, P. ∙ Pacheco-Alvarez, D. ∙ Gamba, G. Role of WNK kinases in the modulation of cell volume Curr. Top. Membr. 2018; 81 :207-235 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hyperosmotic stress also shifts WNK1 from a diffuse to punctate cytoplasmic distribution ( Figure 1 B). This change in localization correlates with NKCC1 activation, KCC inhibition, and RVI ( Roy et al., 2015b 66. Roy, A. ∙ Goodman, J.H. ∙ Begum, G. ... Generation of WNK1 knockout cell lines by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2015; 308 :F366-F376 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zagórska et al., 2007 90. Zagórska, A. ∙ Pozo-Guisado, E. ∙ Boudeau, J. ... Regulation of activity and localization of the WNK1 protein kinase by hyperosmotic stress J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176 :89-100 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The role of these puncta in WNK signaling has been unclear; thus, we sought to understand their dynamics and functional relevance to the volume recovery response. In live cell imaging studies, transiently expressed mammalian (rat) WNK1 shifted to cytoplasmic puncta with modest hyperosmotic stress (50 mM sorbitol; 350 mOsm) ( Figure 1 C), and the foci colocalized with SPAK and OSR1 ( Figure 1 D), suggesting they physiologically regulate WNK signaling. The puncta were visible with sorbitol stresses as low as 25 mM (325 mOsm), and the number of puncta that formed per cell increased with higher degrees of osmotic stress ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Other hyperosmotic stressors exerted similar effects on WNK1 puncta formation ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Although low Cl − hypotonic stress had no apparent effect on WNK distribution ( Figure S1 D), a classic “post-RVD-RVI” maneuver ( Delpire and Gagnon, 2018 14. Delpire, E. ∙ Gagnon, K.B. Water homeostasis and cell volume maintenance and regulation Curr. Top. Membr. 2018; 81 :3-52 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which cells were returned to isosmotic conditions (300 mOsm) following hypotonic swelling, led to acute cell shrinkage, which was again associated with WNK1 puncta formation ( Figure S1 E). This suggests that the WNK1 puncta form in response to relative hypertonic stressors that cause cell shrinkage.
The WNK1 puncta appeared immediately after stress and grew steadily in size, but after 100 s, their size stabilized despite a steady decrease in number ( Figure 1 G). This was associated with the fusion of individual puncta ( Figure 1 H; Video S1 ). As the puncta merged, they behaved like liquids, resolved into round structures ( Figure 1 H; Video S1 ), wetted against intracellular surfaces ( Figure S1 F; Video S1 ), and were membraneless and electron hyperdense in correlative light and transmission electron microscopy (CLEM) experiments ( Figure 1 I). Collectively, these features are typical of condensates that form via PS. At modest WNK1 expression levels, the puncta underwent nucleation and growth ( Figures 1 G and 1J; Videos S1 and S2 ). In cells expressing WNK1 at very high levels, hyperosmotic stress triggered its instantaneous demixing into networks that appeared bicontinuous, consistent with spinodal decomposition ( Figure 1 J; Video S2 ) ( Shimobayashi et al., 2021 73. Shimobayashi, S.F. ∙ Ronceray, P. ∙ Sanders, D.W. ... Nucleation landscape of biomolecular condensates Nature. 2021; 599 :503-506 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Concentration-dependent nucleation and spinodal decomposition are hallmarks of phase-separating systems ( Alberti et al., 2019 3. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T.

WNK1 nucleation and spinodal decomposition, related to Figure 1 Live cell imaging of two cells expressing moderate and very high levels of WNK1-eGFP, subjected to 50mM KCl, demonstrating nucleation and spinodal decomposition, respectively.
Consistent with dynamic phase behavior, the WNK1 droplets exhibited rapid recovery kinetics in photobleaching experiments ( Figures 1 K and 1L; Video S1 ) and dissolved within seconds when the hypertonic stress was quenched with water ( Figure 1 M). In addition, changes in WNK1 fluorescence within and outside of the condensed phase were linked, as the reduction in droplet fluorescence during later stages of the post-stress time course was associated with a reciprocal increase in diffuse phase signal ( Figure 1 N). Thus, condensed material eventually leaves the droplet phase and re-enters the cytosol. In live cell experiments with overexpressed SPAK and WNK1, SPAK mobilized to WNK1 condensates within 15 s of hypertonic stress, and by 100 s accumulated at or near the plasma membrane ( Figure S1 G; Video S3 ). This finding was not observed when SPAK was overexpressed in the absence of WNK1, indicating that its phase behavior is WNK1 dependent ( Figure S1 H; Video S3 ).

Effect of WNK1 on SPAK localization during hypertonic stress, related to Figure S1 Live cell imaging of HEK-293 cells, cotransfected with eGFP-WNK1 and mRuby2-SPAK, or mRuby2-SPAK alone, subjected to hyperosmotic stress (50mM sorbitol; final osmolality = 350 mOsm).
To determine whether these findings are relevant at native levels of WNK1 expression, we first evaluated endogenous WNK1 localization in fixed HEK-293 cells subjected to hyperosmotic stress, using a validated WNK1 antibody ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Osmotically stressed cells exhibited high-intensity WNK1 puncta that nucleated above optical diffraction limits ( Figures 2 A and 2B) and became larger with increasing degrees of hypertonicity ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Similar findings were observed in U2OS and GBM43 glioma cells ( Figure S2 C). In all three cell lines tested, endogenous WNK1 was occasionally present in small high-intensity puncta under isosmotic conditions ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and S2 C). This suggests that low-level WNK1 puncta formation could contribute to its endogenous baseline activity during isotonicity.
To assess native WNK1 condensate dynamics, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to introduce an in-frame N-terminal mNeonGreen (mNG) fluorescence tag into the first exon of WNK1 ( Figure S2 D). This modification had no effect on WNK1 expression or on SPAK/OSR1 activation ( Figure S2 E). Though the mNG-WNK1 puncta were smaller than those observed during overexpressed conditions, they nucleated seconds after hyperosmotic stress and underwent fusion ( Video S4 ). Like the overexpressed WNK1 condensates, the fusion events resulted in high-intensity mNG-WNK1 puncta that steadily decreased in number but maintained a relatively stable size over a time course of minutes ( Figures 2 E and 2F). The mNG-WNK1 puncta also exhibited recovery in FRAP experiments ( Figure S2 F), though the kinetics were slightly slower than that of the overexpressed WNK1 condensates ( Figure 1 L). Consistent with a physiologic role in WNK signaling, mNG-WNK1 puncta contained the osmotic stress-responsive paralogs WNK3 ( Pacheco-Alvarez et al., 2020 52. Pacheco-Alvarez, D. ∙ Carrillo-Pérez, D.L. ∙ Mercado, A. ... WNK3 and WNK4 exhibit opposite sensitivity with respect to cell volume and intracellular chloride concentration Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2020; 319 :C371-C380 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), SPAK, and OSR1 ( Figure 2 G). The signals for WNK3, total SPAK, total OSR1, and phosphorylated SPAK and OSR1 (pSPAK/pOSR1), were 70%–80% colocalized with mNG-WNK1 ( Figure 2 H).

WNK1 puncta formation in mNG-WNK1 knock-in cells, related to Figure 2 Live cell imaging of gene-edited cells expressing endogenously mNG-tagged WNK1 (Figure S2).
In high resolution colocalization studies with subcellular markers, the mNG-WNK1 puncta did not colocalize with endosomes (EEA1) or lysosomes (LAMP2) ( Figures S3 A and S3B). In contrast to an earlier report ( Zagórska et al., 2007 90. Zagórska, A. ∙ Pozo-Guisado, E. ∙ Boudeau, J. ... Regulation of activity and localization of the WNK1 protein kinase by hyperosmotic stress J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176 :89-100 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also did not observe colocalization between mNG-WNK1 and the AP-1 adaptor complex. However, consistent with prior work ( Pleiner et al., 2021 58. Pleiner, T. ∙ Hazu, M. ∙ Tomaleri, G.P. ... WNK1 is an assembly factor for the human ER membrane protein complex Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 2693–2704.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zagórska et al., 2007 90. Zagórska, A. ∙ Pozo-Guisado, E. ∙ Boudeau, J. ... Regulation of activity and localization of the WNK1 protein kinase by hyperosmotic stress J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176 :89-100 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ), the stress-induced WNK1 puncta colocalized strongly with clathrin heavy chain (CHC; Figures S3 A and S3B). Hypertonic stress suppresses endocytosis, coated pit formation, and releases CHC from membranes into the cytosol ( Hansen et al., 1993 27. Hansen, S.H. ∙ Sandvig, K. ∙ van Deurs, B. Clathrin and HA2 adaptors: effects of potassium depletion, hypertonic medium, and cytosol acidification J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121 :61-72 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ; Heuser and Anderson, 1989 30. Heuser, J.E. ∙ Anderson, R.G. Hypertonic media inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis by blocking clathrin-coated pit formation J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108 :389-400 Crossref Scopus (824) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because CHC also physically associates with WNK1 ( Pleiner et al., 2021 58. Pleiner, T. ∙ Hazu, M. ∙ Tomaleri, G.P. ... WNK1 is an assembly factor for the human ER membrane protein complex Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 2693–2704.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), these findings indicate that WNK1 sequesters clathrin within membraneless condensates during cell shrinkage. Overexpressed WNK1 also colocalized strongly with CHC during hyperosmotic stress, indicating that the condensates characterized in Figure 1 and natively expressed mNG-WNK1 puncta share the same features ( Figure S3 C). Further supporting the membraneless nature of mNG-WNK1 puncta, they partially colocalized with EMC2, a soluble subunit of the ER membrane protein complex that binds to WNK1 in the cytosol ( Pleiner et al., 2021 58. Pleiner, T. ∙ Hazu, M. ∙ Tomaleri, G.P. ... WNK1 is an assembly factor for the human ER membrane protein complex Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 2693–2704.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the WNK1 condensates failed to colocalize with TIAR-1, eIF4e, and DCP2 ( Figures S3 A and S3B), indicating that they are distinct from stress granules and P-bodies.
Homo- and heterotypic molecular interactions drive protein phase behavior ( Riback et al., 2020 62. Riback, J.A. ∙ Zhu, L. ∙ Ferrolino, M.C. ... Composition-dependent thermodynamics of intracellular phase separation Nature. 2020; 581 :209-214 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, multivalent interactions between SH3 domains and binding partners harboring proline-rich motifs can trigger PS ( Li et al., 2012 38. Li, P. ∙ Banjade, S. ∙ Cheng, H.C. ... Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins Nature. 2012; 483 :336-340 Crossref Scopus (1681) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, PS often requires associations between intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of low sequence complexity that contain prion-like domains (PLDs) ( Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 75. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2171) PubMed Google Scholar ). WNK1 harbors numerous proline-rich motifs that bind to SH3 and WW domain partners ( He et al., 2007 29. He, G. ∙ Wang, H.R. ∙ Huang, S.K. ... Intersectin links WNK kinases to endocytosis of ROMK1 J.

Alternatively spliced proline-rich cassettes link WNK1 to aldosterone action J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :3433-3448 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), and prediction analysis revealed that nearly the entire WNK1 polypeptide sequence outside of the kinase domain is disordered and of low complexity ( Figure 3 A). This includes the large CTD, which harbors two coiled-coil domains (CCDs) adjacent to low-complexity PLDs. Thus, WNK1 contains multiple features that may confer its phase behavior.
To screen for regions of WNK1 that are prone to PS, we used an optogenetic approach that takes advantage of the photolyase homology region (PHR) of Arabidopsis thaliana Cry2, which transiently self-associates upon exposure to blue light. Fusing a condensation-prone sequence to the Cry2-PHR domain triggers light-inducible PS (LIPS) ( Figures 3 B and 3C) ( Mann et al., 2019 43. Mann, J.R. ∙ Gleixner, A.M. ∙ Mauna, J.C. ...

Spatiotemporal control of intracellular phase transitions using light-activated optoDroplets Cell. 2017; 168 159–171.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (588) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cry2Olig, an engineered PHR variant, exhibits higher sensitivity to light-induced clustering ( Taslimi et al., 2014 82. Taslimi, A. ∙ Vrana, J.D. ∙ Chen, D. ... An optimized optogenetic clustering tool for probing protein interaction and function Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4925 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 B). We screened for regions in WNK1 that undergo strong or weak LIPS by generating WNK1 fragments fused to either the wild-type (WT) PHR domain of Cry2, or to Cry2Olig ( Figure 3 D). This approach mapped two areas within the WNK1 CTD that underwent LIPS. One fragment encoding the extreme C-terminal (CT) end (1,770–2,126) was strongly prone to PS, as both the WT and Cry2Olig fusions underwent LIPS ( Figures 3 D and 3E). In addition, rare spontaneous puncta were appreciable with the Cry2Olig construct in the dark state, further supporting its highly condensation-prone nature ( Figure 3 E, arrowheads). A second more proximal region (480–1,242) condensed less strongly, as only the Cry2Olig fusion underwent LIPS ( Figures 3 D and 3E). Notably, both condensation-prone fragments are low-complexity IDRs within the WNK1 CTD that contain CCDs and prion-like signatures. Other regions of WNK1, such as the kinase domain (209–479) failed to undergo LIPS in either the WT PHR or Cry2Olig constructs ( Figures 3 D and 3E).
To evaluate whether the WNK1 CTD mediates osmotic stress-induced PS, we compared the phase behavior of full-length WNK1 to two fragments: (1–1,242), containing the proximal PS-prone region, and (1–494), which lacks the entire CTD ( Figure 3 F). Given the strong dependence of phase behavior on protein concentration ( Alberti et al., 2019 3. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T. Considerations and challenges in studying liquid-liquid phase separation and biomolecular condensates Cell. 2019; 176 :419-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1507) PubMed Google Scholar ), cells with similar levels of pre-stress fluorescence were compared. Although the 1–1,242 construct underwent PS, it failed to efficiently clear from the cytosol, resulting in smaller less well-defined condensates compared with the full-length protein ( Figure 3 G; Video S5 ). The 1–494 construct did not visibly phase separate ( Figure 3 G; Video S5 ).

Response of CTD truncation mutants to hyperosmotic stress, related to Figure 3 Live cell imaging of WNK1 constructs ( Figure 3 F), expressed in HEK-293 cells and subjected to hyperosmotic stress (50mM sorbitol).
To get a better sense of how the phase behavior of these constructs is tied to WNK1 expression levels, we generated in-cell phase diagrams that estimate in vivo PS at different degrees of hyperosmotic stress as a function of pre-stress fluorescence intensity, a surrogate for protein concentration ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Both the full length and 1–1,242 constructs formed stress-induced nucleated and spinodal assemblies ( Figure S4 A). However, compared with full-length WNK1, the 1–1,242 construct required higher levels of protein expression and hyperosmotic stress to uniformly cross the transition threshold from a diffuse to nucleated state (a phase boundary referred to as the binodal) ( Shimobayashi et al., 2021 73. Shimobayashi, S.F. ∙ Ronceray, P. ∙ Sanders, D.W. ... Nucleation landscape of biomolecular condensates Nature. 2021; 599 :503-506 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 H and S4 B). On the other hand, the spinodal phase boundary (i.e., the threshold at which a protein undergoes spinodal decomposition instead of nucleation) was roughly similar for the two constructs, particularly at hyperosmotic stresses below 400 mOsm. Thus, compared with full-length WNK1, the binodal and spinodal curves for the 1–1,242 construct were contracted, resulting in a narrowing of the nucleation window within the physiologic range of hyperosmotic stress ( Figure 3 H). In contrast to these two constructs, the 1–494 fragment did not form visible condensates at any of the osmotic stresses tested, and thus appeared to exist in a one-phase regime.
If WNK nucleation into droplets augments kinase activation, the PS-deficient 1–494 and 1–1,242 constructs should exhibit less activation than the full-length protein. To test this, we performed biochemical assessments of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway at physiologic levels of hyperosmotic stress (350 mOsm). To eliminate the influence of endogenous osmotically responsive WNK kinases, we conducted these studies in WNK1/WNK3 double knockout (DKO) cells ( Figure S5 A), which exhibit a reduction in baseline and hypertonicity-induced SPAK/OSR1, NKCC1, and KCC phosphorylation relative to unedited controls ( Figure S5 B). In DKO cells expressing transfected full-length WNK1, 50 mM sorbitol triggered immunodetectable phosphoactivation of SPAK/OSR1 and downstream phosphorylation of NKCC1 and KCCs ( Figures 3 I and 3J). In contrast, there was little to no increase in phosphorylation of SPAK/OSR1, NKCC1, or KCC in DKO cells transfected with the 1–1,242 or 1–494 constructs ( Figure 3 J). Combining these biochemical studies with the live cell imaging data, these results collectively suggest that the entire CTD is necessary for WNK1 to drive optimal SPAK/OSR1 activation and downstream NKCC1/KCC phosphorylation via PS.
CCDs are often present within proteins that undergo PS ( Ford and Fioriti, 2020 20. Ford, L.K. ∙ Fioriti, L. Coiled-coil motifs of RNA-binding proteins: dynamicity in RNA regulation Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2020; 8 :607947 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because CCDs reside within both regions within the WNK1 CTD that confer its phase behavior ( Figure 3 A), we sought to determine their importance. Coiled coils (CCs) are formed by amino acid heptad repeats (denoted by residues a through g ). Positions a and d define the CC core ( Figure 4 A) and are frequently occupied by hydrophobic residues, or by “ambivalent hydrophobes” such as glutamine ( Fiumara et al., 2010 17. Fiumara, F. ∙ Fioriti, L. ∙ Kandel, E.R. ... Essential role of coiled coils for aggregation and activity of Q/N-rich prions and PolyQ proteins Cell. 2010; 143 :1121-1135 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sodek et al., 1972 78. Sodek, J. ∙ Hodges, R.S. ∙ Smillie, L.B. ... Amino-acid sequence of rabbit skeletal tropomyosin and its coiled-coil structure Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1972; 69 :3800-3804 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hydrophobic and glutamine residues were present in the a and d registers of both CT WNK1 CCDs ( Figure 4 B). In the CT-CC, the a - d frame also contained a known “HQ” signature, which facilitates WNK-WNK interactions ( Thastrup et al., 2012 83. Thastrup, J.O. ∙ Rafiqi, F.H. ∙ Vitari, A.C. ... SPAK/OSR1 regulate NKCC1 and WNK activity: analysis of WNK isoform interactions and activation by T-loop trans-autophosphorylation Biochem. J. 2012; 441 :325-337 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). We substituted prolines into these predicted key residues to disrupt CC periodicity without influencing regional disorder tendency ( Figures 4 B and 4C). This allowed us to specifically evaluate the CCDs independently of IDR function.
Optogenetic assessment of phase-separating WNK1 fragments containing the CCDs revealed no effect of the proline mutations on LIPS ( Figure 4 D). However, in comparative in-cell phase diagrams, a full-length double mutant construct containing proline substitutions in both the MidCC and CT-CC (WNK1-CC mut ; Figure 4 C) exhibited a rightward shift of the binodal phase boundary ( Figure 4 E). Furthermore, in WNK1-CC mut expressing cells that formed WNK condensates, disruption of the CT CCDs resulted in smaller short-lived puncta. Consistent with reduced WNK1 retention within condensates, this was associated with higher fluorescence intensity in the diffuse phase ( Figure 4 F). Thus, mutation of the CCDs impaired WNK1’s ability to efficiently form large droplets that increase in size and decrease in number as they extract material from the diffuse phase and fuse. In comparative immunoblots with full-length WT-WNK1, CCD disruption impaired downstream SPAK/OSR1, NKCC1, and KCC phosphorylation ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Collectively, these findings indicate that though the CT CCDs are not necessary for PS, they facilitate optimal WNK1 nucleation and pathway activation within condensates.
We wondered whether the disorder features present in rat WNK1 are present in other WNK kinases. Thus, we analyzed four WNKs with poorly alignable sequences outside of the kinase domain that mediate similar functions with regards to osmotic stress responsiveness and/or ion transport: human WNK1 (hWNK1), human WNK3 (hWNK3), Drosophila melanogaster WNK (dmWNK), and Caenorhabditis elegans WNK (ceWNK). Despite their poor sequence identity, the disorder tendency plots and PLDs for these WNKs are nearly identical ( Figure 5 A). To further explore sequence relationships in WNK IDRs that likely exhibit phase behavior, we analyzed the amino acid composition of WNK CTDs across evolution, extending from humans to protists ( Figure S6 ). Mammalian WNK kinases are enriched in prolines and serines, which comprise approximately 25% of the amino acids in the disordered CTD. This compositional bias extends to freshwater vertebrate fish. However, in many organisms extending from invertebrates down to protists, glutamine is the preferred amino acid. Glutamine and serine regulate the material properties of condensates in a similar manner ( Wang et al., 2018 85. Wang, J. ∙ Choi, J.M. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ... A molecular grammar governing the driving forces for phase separation of prion-like RNA binding proteins Cell. 2018; 174 688–699.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1114) Google Scholar ). Thus, the WNK CTD underwent a permissive Q-to-P/S switch in compositional bias during early vertebrate evolution that conserved its regional disorder tendency, likely to preserve its phase behavior. This suggests that the ability of WNK kinases to form condensates is an ancient, fundamental property.
To test this further, we turned to the dmWNK kinase. dmWNK is a central regulator of ion transport in the Malpighian tubule (MT), an ancient but conserved model of the mammalian nephron ( Rodan, 2018 64. Rodan, A.R. WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling: lessons learned from an insect renal epithelium Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2018; 315 :F903-F907 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within this system, dmWNK triggers NKCC phosphoactivation via the SPAK homolog Fray. Although the rat WNK1 CTD bears a P/S-rich composition present in other mammalian WNKs, the dmWNK CTD is Q-enriched, as is the case for many invertebrates ( Figure 5 B). These glutamines cluster in poly-Q tracts that reside in the proximal and distal regions of the CTD—PLDs that correspond to regions in rat WNK1 that were identified to be critical for PS ( Figure 5 B). Though poly-Q prion-like sequences are classically considered to be mediators of pathological protein aggregation, they can facilitate physiological stress-induced phase transitions ( Franzmann et al., 2018 22. Franzmann, T.M. ∙ Jahnel, M. ∙ Pozniakovsky, A. ... Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness Science. 2018; 359 :eaao5654 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given these observations, we asked whether dmWNK phase separates during hyperosmotic stress. In live cell imaging studies in Drosophila S2 cells overexpressing GFP-tagged dmWNK, the full-length construct (1–2,253) behaved similarly to mammalian WNK1, shifting to condensates during hyperosmotic stress ( Figure 5 D). A deletion analysis confirmed that, like rat WNK1, dmWNK harbors two zones within its CTD that are primarily responsible for its phase behavior. One of these (846–1,000) is a Q-rich region in the middle of the protein that harbors a CCD, while the other is contained within the more distal region of the CTD (1,001–2,253) ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Although a dmWNK fragment lacking this distal region (1–1,000) still formed condensates ( Figure 5 D), it exhibited PS in fewer cells compared with the full-length protein at a given level of osmotic stress ( Figure 5 E). Thus, like mammalian WNK1, the entire disordered CTD is required for optimal PS. These findings reinforce evidence that WNK phase behavior is highly conserved and encoded within specific regions of the CTD.
To determine whether the WNK1 CTD influences RVI, we performed live cell volume measurements using resonant scanning confocal microscopy. RVI is classically mediated by two processes: cariporide-sensitive coupled sodium/proton and chloride/bicarbonate exchange and bumetanide-sensitive NKCC1/KCC transport ( Figure 6 A) ( Hoffmann et al., 2009 31. Hoffmann, E.K. ∙ Lambert, I.H. ∙ Pedersen, S.F. Physiology of cell volume regulation in vertebrates Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89 :193-277 Crossref Scopus (1189) PubMed Google Scholar ). To rule out compensation by the sodium/proton exchanger NHE1, all volume measurements were conducted in the presence of cariporide. Following exposure to 50 mM sorbitol, cells expressing full-length rat WNK1 on a WNK1/WNK3 DKO background exhibited a rapid reduction in cell volume ( Figure 6 B). Notably, the degree of relative volume contraction in DKO cells expressing the 1–494 construct was less than that of DKO cells expressing full-length WNK1 ( Figures 6 B and 6C). This was associated with baseline differences in cell size. As shown in Figure 6 D, 2 days post-transfection, DKO cells expressing WNK1 1–494 were 15%–20% larger than those expressing full-length WNK1. This suggests that cells expressing the 1–494 construct adapt to low baseline WNK activity by maintaining a larger size during the 48h window following transfection. Because cells expressing WNK1 1–494 are larger, their percent volume reduction in response to a given hypertonic stress is less compared with smaller cells expressing full-length WNK1.
To account for the differences in acute volume reduction in cells expressing full-length versus 1–494 WNK1, RVI was defined as percent volume recovery, expressed relative to the volume lost (see STAR Methods ). In cells expressing full-length WNK1, volume contraction was followed by a linear recovery over time, consistent with classical RVI ( Figures 6 B and 6E). In contrast, cells expressing the CTD-deficient 1–494 construct exhibited sluggish RVI following acute cell shrinkage ( Figure 6 E). In cells expressing full-length WNK1, preincubation with the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide blunted the RVI response within the first 5 min of the recovery time course ( Figure 6 F). In contrast, cells expressing WNK1 1–494 exhibited similar RVI curves in the presence and absence of bumetanide ( Figure 6 G). Thus, DKO cells expressing the full-length WNK1 construct mounted a bumetanide-sensitive NKCC1-mediated RVI response, while cells expressing the PS-deficient 1–494 construct did not ( Figure 6 H).
Next, we evaluated the truncated WNK1-1–1,242 ( Figures 6 I and 6J) and the WNK1-CC mut CCD mutant constructs ( Figures 6 K and 6L). In both cases, volume recovery was significantly impaired within the first 5 min post-stress, though the defective RVI responses were less severe than those observed in cells expressing the fully PS-deficient 1–494 construct ( Figure 6 M). Because the 1–1,242 and CC mut constructs exhibited PS phenotypes that were only partially defective, these findings indicate that WNK1-mediated RVI correlates with its phase behavior.
To determine the functional importance of the disordered WNK1 CTD on NKCC1 transport, we measured influx of the K+ congener rubidium (Rb+) under isotonic and hypertonic conditions in WNK1/WNK3 DKO cells expressing full-length or 1–494 WNK1. Consistent with the low NKCC1 phosphorylation status in WNK1/WNK3 DKO cells ( Figure S5 B), in the absence of transfected constructs, the DKO cells exhibit low bumetanide-sensitive Rb+ flux, both at baseline and during hypertonic stress ( Figures S5 C–S5E). However, we also found that they exhibit increased ouabain-sensitive (Na+/K+ ATPase-mediated) Rb+ influx, suggesting that the DKO cells increase pump activity to compensate for the chronic absence of NKCC/KCC phosphorylation caused by WNK1/WNK3 deletion ( Figures S5 C–S5E). For this reason, we focused on bumetanide-sensitive fluxes for these experiments. A shift in osmolality from near isotonicity (310 mOsm) to hypertonicity (370 mOsm) was associated with greater shrinkage-induced bumetanide-sensitive Rb+ influx in DKO cells expressing full-length WNK1 compared with 1–494 WNK1 ( Figures 6 N and 6O).
Our deletion and coiled-coil mutant analyses demonstrate that the WNK CTD mediates PS and is critical for RVI following cell shrinkage ( Figures 3 , 4 , and 6 ). However, these studies do not uncouple PS from other potential functions encoded within the CTD that may be critical for RVI. To determine whether WNK kinase PS per se mediates RVI, we replaced the WNK1 CTD (residues 495–2,126) with orthogonal disordered domains from two unrelated proteins known to confer PS. The first of these chimeras contained the N-terminal 267 amino acids of fused in sarcoma (FUS), while the second contained residues 274–414 of TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) ( Figures S7 A and S7B). Both domains are well-studied intrinsically disordered low-complexity regions (LCRs) that drive PS ( Portz et al., 2021 60. Portz, B. ∙ Lee, B.L. ∙ Shorter, J. FUS and TDP-43 phases in health and disease Trends Biochem. Sci. 2021; 46 :550-563 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because these domains were fused to a truncated WNK1 construct that does not phase separate but contains a fully intact active kinase domain, this allowed us to test whether PS of the WNK1 kinase domain is sufficient to trigger an RVI response. The WNK1 1–494-FUS and 1–494-TDP-43 chimeras underwent PS within seconds of exposure to 50 mM sorbitol ( Figure S7 C; Video S6 ), and live cell coexpression studies revealed that SPAK partially colocalized with the chimeras in condensates ( Figure S7 D). In RVI experiments, both the WNK1 1–494-FUS and 1–494-TDP-43 chimeras mediated volume recovery more efficiently than 1–494 alone ( Figures 6 M, S7 E, and S7F). Surprisingly, the 1–494-TDP-43 construct rescued volume almost as efficiently as the full-length WNK1 protein ( Figure S7 F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that PS of the WNK1 kinase domain is sufficient to mediate RVI.

Macromolecular crowding commonly triggers protein PS and has also been proposed to be a stimulus for RVI ( André and Spruijt, 2020 4. André, A.A.M. ∙ Spruijt, E. Liquid-liquid phase separation in crowded environments Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :5908 Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar ; Colclasure and Parker, 1991 9. Colclasure, G.C. ∙ Parker, J.C. Cytosolic protein concentration is the primary volume signal in dog red cells J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98 :881-892 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Delarue et al., 2018 12. Delarue, M. ∙ Brittingham, G.P. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ... mTORC1 controls phase separation and the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm by tuning crowding Cell. 2018; 174 338–349.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we hypothesized that the formation of bioactive WNK1 condensates may be the manifestation of a crowding-sensing mechanism that triggers the RVI response. To test this, we designed an experiment that augments cytoplasmic molecular crowding without causing cell shrinkage. Ficoll is a molecular crowding agent that is commonly used to trigger protein PS in vitro ( André and Spruijt, 2020 4. André, A.A.M. ∙ Spruijt, E. Liquid-liquid phase separation in crowded environments Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :5908 Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar ). We reasoned that cytoplasmic Ficoll microinjection should increase the degree of cytosolic crowding while simultaneously increasing cell size. If a protein phase separates under such conditions, it could be reasoned that it does so because of molecular crowding rather than shrinkage ( Figure 7 A).
As a first approach, we used mNG-WNK1 cells, which express WNK1 at native levels. As noted in Figure 2 E, these cells exhibit low-grade WNK1 condensation under isotonic conditions, resulting in a granular appearing cytoplasm with partial localization of mNG fluorescence in small puncta ( Figure 7 B). Following the microinjection of a control vehicle buffer lacking crowding agent, cells expanded and the mNG signal became diffuse and homogeneous, consistent with condensate dissolution due to cytoplasmic dilution ( Figure 7 B). In contrast, Ficoll microinjection triggered the formation of large WNK1 condensates, which extracted WNK1 from the surrounding dilute phase ( Figure 7 C). Introduction of Ficoll into swollen cells that were precleared of puncta by hypotonic stress was associated with the localized collection of long-lived condensates that grew near the injection site over time ( Figures 7 D and 7E).
We also conducted injection studies in WT HEK-293 cells overexpressing mRb2-tagged WNK1 constructs. In cells expressing full-length WNK1, cytosolic Ficoll injection triggered widespread condensate formation ( Figure 7 F; Video S7 ). In contrast, the 1–494 WNK1 fragment did not phase separate following cytosolic injection. Instead, it remained diffuse, and its cytosolic fluorescence intensity decreased, likely due to signal dilution caused by an increase in cell size following microinjection ( Figure 7 G; Video S7 ). In contrast to full-length WNK1, whose subcellular distribution is restricted to the cytosol, the truncated 1–494 construct partially distributes in the nucleus, and the fluorescence intensity of the nuclear fraction remained relatively constant throughout the course of the experiment. These findings demonstrate that in vivo WNK1 PS is due to changes in cytoplasmic crowding rather than cell size. These findings therefore implicate WNK kinases as intracellular molecular crowding sensors that utilize PS as a mechanism to control cell volume.

Section: Discussion

WNK kinases have long been appreciated to participate in cellular osmosensing, but the mechanisms by which they activate downstream signaling following volume contraction have been obscure. In this work, we show that WNK1 responds to hyperosmotic stress by detecting a crowded cytosol. It does so by undergoing PS, forming functional condensates that activate the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway to trigger downstream NKCC1/KCC phosphorylation, net ion influx, and RVI ( Figure 7 H). WNK1 phase behavior occurs within physiological constraints and is mediated by its large CTD, which is highly conserved with respect to its size, regional disorder tendency, and domain organization, despite poor sequence identity across evolution. These features allow even the most ancient WNKs to quickly detect small changes in hypertonicity. Taken together, our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved function for WNK kinases as physiological crowding sensors and identify WNK1 as a key constituent of a multicomponent signaling condensate that manages acute reductions in cell volume.
The theory of macromolecular crowding as a cell volume signal and as a stimulus for cytoplasmic PS was proposed decades ago ( Parker, 1993 53. Parker, J.C. In defense of cell volume? Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265 :C1191-C1200 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Walter and Brooks, 1995 84. Walter, H. ∙ Brooks, D.E. Phase separation in cytoplasm, due to macromolecular crowding, is the basis for microcompartmentation FEBS Lett. 1995; 361 :135-139 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zimmerman and Harrison, 1987 92. Zimmerman, S.B. ∙ Harrison, B. Macromolecular crowding increases binding of DNA polymerase to DNA: an adaptive effect Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84 :1871-1875 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). These concepts were underappreciated; however, a paradigm shift in our understanding of cytoplasmic organization has prompted their reappraisal ( Hyman et al., 2014 32. Hyman, A.A. ∙ Weber, C.A. ∙ Jülicher, F. Liquid-liquid phase separation in biology Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30 :39-58 Crossref Scopus (1964) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hypertonicity diminishes solvation of the cytosol, creating an ideal milieu for interactions between multivalent proteins that are prone to phase behavior. This suggests that crowding-induced PS caused by hyperosmotic stress broadly modulates the activity of biomolecules that tend to form condensates ( Jalihal et al., 2020 33. Jalihal, A.P. ∙ Pitchiaya, S. ∙ Xiao, L. ... Multivalent proteins rapidly and reversibly phase-separate upon osmotic cell volume change Mol. Cell. 2020; 79 978–990.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The ability of WNK1 to activate in response to crowding addresses a longstanding paradox in the WNK signaling field. As shown here, the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NKCC pathway is upregulated by hypertonicity; however, intracellular Cl − and K + depletion are also potent WNK activators ( Piala et al., 2014 57. Piala, A.T. ∙ Moon, T.M. ∙ Akella, R. ... Chloride sensing by WNK1 involves inhibition of autophosphorylation Sci. Signal. 2014; 7 :ra41 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pleinis et al., 2021 59. Pleinis, J.M. ∙ Norrell, L. ∙ Akella, R. ... WNKs are potassium-sensitive kinases Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2021; 320 :C703-C721 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations have been difficult to reconcile, as hypertonic stress raises intracellular ionic strength due to exosmosis ( O'Neill, 1999 50. O'Neill, W.C. Physiological significance of volume-regulatory transporters Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276 :C995-C1011 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Because this elevation in intracellular Cl − and K + concentrations should inhibit WNK kinase activity, the stimulatory effects of hypertonicity seem counterintuitive. Our results provide evidence that the crowding-dependent condensation of WNK kinases allows them to activate while bypassing the inhibitory effects of high ionic strength caused by cell water loss.
WNK kinases harbor a large intrinsically disordered CTD, usually greater than 100 kDa in mass, whose function has been incompletely understood. Our studies show that the entire domain is critical for WNK1 to undergo PS in response to modest reductions in cell volume. The WNK CTD can therefore be thought of as a physiological crowding-sensing domain. Though the sequence identities of WNK CTDs vary widely across evolution, their regional features in terms of disorder, low complexity, and prion-like signatures share striking similarities. In mammalian WNK1, regions at both the proximal and distal ends of the CTD are particularly prone to phase behavior, and CCDs within these regions augment kinase retention within the condensed phase to optimize downstream SPAK/OSR1 activation. Moreover, deletion of the distal end of the CTD impairs condensate formation, reducing the sensitivity of WNK1 to crowding. Analysis of the Drosophila WNK CTD suggests that these features are evolutionarily conserved. Thus, it appears that the large size of the CTD is a conserved feature that allows WNK kinases to react to physiologic changes in cytosolic crowding. These findings have implications for understanding how IDRs mediate physiological sensing functions in vivo .
Our findings have broad implications for WNK-dependent signaling in health and disease, as the mechanisms that mediate RVI have been leveraged by higher organisms to control advanced physiologic processes. For example, mutations in the WNK signaling pathway cause hypertension and hyperkalemia due to the overactivation of NCC, an NKCC1-like SLC12 salt cotransporter localized to kidney distal convoluted tubule (DCT) ( Subramanya and Ellison, 2014 81. Subramanya, A.R. ∙ Ellison, D.H. Distal convoluted tubule Clin. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2014; 9 :2147-2163 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within this nephron segment, WNK activation is associated with the formation of DCT-specific biomolecular condensates called WNK bodies ( Boyd-Shiwarski et al., 2018 6. Boyd-Shiwarski, C.R. ∙ Shiwarski, D.J. ∙ Roy, A. ... Potassium-regulated distal tubule WNK bodies are kidney-specific WNK1 dependent Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29 :499-509 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). The assembly of these membraneless structures is driven by KS-WNK1, a truncated WNK1 isoform that retains the entire disordered CTD shown here to be critical for PS. This suggests that KS-WNK1 scaffolds WNK-dependent phase transitions that participate in volume and K+ homeostasis. NKCC1-dependent transport contributes to colonic epithelial K+ secretion ( Nickerson and Rajendran, 2021 47. Nickerson, A.J. ∙ Rajendran, V.M. Aldosterone up-regulates basolateral Na + -K + -2Cl − cotransporter-1 to support enhanced large-conductance K + channel-mediated K + secretion in rat distal colon FASEB J. 2021; 35 :e21606 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), choroid plexus function ( Steffensen et al., 2018 80. Steffensen, A.B. ∙ Oernbo, E.K. ∙ Stoica, A. ... Cotransporter-mediated water transport underlying cerebrospinal fluid formation Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2167 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ischemic stroke ( Bhuiyan et al., 2017 5. Bhuiyan, M.I.H. ∙ Song, S. ∙ Yuan, H. ... WNK-Cab39-NKCC1 signaling increases the susceptibility to ischemic brain damage in hypertensive rats J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2017; 37 :2780-2794 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ); these processes likely require WNK phase behavior. Furthermore, drugs targeting the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway may influence condensate dynamics. ZT-1a, a potent small molecule SPAK inhibitor, disrupts interactions with WNK1 and mitigates ischemic injury following stroke ( Zhang et al., 2020 91. Zhang, J. ∙ Bhuiyan, M.I.H. ∙ Zhang, T. ... Modulation of brain cation-Cl(−) cotransport via the SPAK kinase inhibitor ZT-1a Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :78 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). It would be of interest to evaluate whether ZT-1a modulates condensate-dependent WNK signaling, as this may have implications for future therapeutics for the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway, and for condensate drug design in general.
PS has emerged as a fundamental property of biomolecules that is reshaping theories regarding cellular organization. However, protein phase behavior is often only loosely connected to physiological relevance ( Leslie, 2021 37. Leslie, M. Separation anxiety Science. 2021; 371 :336-338 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; McSwiggen et al., 2019 44. McSwiggen, D.T. ∙ Mir, M. ∙ Darzacq, X. ... Evaluating phase separation in live cells: diagnosis, caveats, and functional consequences Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :1619-1634 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results provide evidence that PS of the WNK signaling pathway is functionally relevant, occurring at native protein concentrations and at levels of osmotic stress that are within a physiological range commonly experienced during life. Many of the biophysical principles regarding the inherent molecular features of phase-separating systems are evolutionarily encoded within WNK kinases to link condensate formation to cell volume regulation. Thus, the results presented here provide strong support for the relevance of biomolecular condensates in cellular physiology.
Some of our live cell experiments were conducted with eGFP-tagged constructs. Because eGFP is weakly dimeric, this might have influenced condensate dynamics. Though WNK1 activates within condensates, how it does so remains an open question. in vitro evidence suggests that hyperosmotic stress triggers WNK autoactivation via dehydration of the kinase domain ( Akella et al., 2021 2. Akella, R. ∙ Humphreys, J.M. ∙ Sekulski, K. ... Osmosensing by WNK kinases Mol. Biol. Cell. 2021; 32 :1614-1623 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because condensed phases provide alternate solvent environments ( Nott et al., 2015 48. Nott, T.J. ∙ Petsalaki, E. ∙ Farber, P. ... Phase transition of a disordered nuage protein generates environmentally responsive membraneless organelles Mol. Cell. 2015; 57 :936-947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1217) PubMed Google Scholar ), they may be an ideal location for this process to occur. Due to the lack of suitable phosphoantibodies, however, we were unable to directly measure WNK autoactivation. Our data indicate that following condensation, the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway eventually re-enters the cytosol. We did not investigate how this occurs, though it seems likely that phosphorylation of signaling molecules within condensates is involved. Alternatively, co-regulators of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway may be required. For example, kinases such as ASK3 ( Watanabe et al., 2021 86. Watanabe, K. ∙ Morishita, K. ∙ Zhou, X. ... Cells recognize osmotic stress through liquid-liquid phase separation lubricated with poly(ADP-ribose) Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :1353 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), mTOR ( Demian et al., 2019 15. Demian, W.L. ∙ Persaud, A. ∙ Jiang, C. ... The ion transporter NKCC1 links cell volume to cell mass regulation by suppressing mTORC1 Cell Rep. 2019; 27 1886–1896.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), p38 ( Liu et al., 2022 40. Liu, Z. ∙ Demian, W. ∙ Persaud, A. ... Regulation of the p38-MAPK pathway by hyperosmolarity and by WNK kinases Sci. Rep. 2022; 12 :14480 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), and protein kinase C ( Li et al., 2004 39. Li, Y. ∙ Hu, J. ∙ Vita, R. ... SPAK kinase is a substrate and target of PKCtheta in T-cell receptor-induced AP-1 activation pathway EMBO J. 2004; 23 :1112-1122 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), or volume regulated channels such as LRRC8 ( Serra et al., 2021 72. Serra, S.A. ∙ Stojakovic, P. ∙ Amat, R. ... LRRC8A-containing chloride channel is crucial for cell volume recovery and survival under hypertonic conditions Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2025013118 Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar ), may influence the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway within or outside of condensates and would be ideal candidates to evaluate in future studies.

HEK-293 and U2OS cells (both human, female) were cultured in a 37-degree 5% CO 2 incubator in complete media (glucose-supplemented DMEM with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin). All HEK-293 cell lines are tested for mycoplasma contamination quarterly. GBM43 cells (human, male) were cultured in a 37-degree CO2 incubator in Neurobasal media supplemented with B27-A and N2 (ThermoFisher), basic FGF, EGF, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Drosophila S2-Gal4 cells (male; provided by Dr. Adrian Rothenfluh) ( Acevedo et al., 2015 1. Acevedo, S.F. ∙ Peru y Colón de Portugal, R.L. ∙ Gonzalez, D.A. ... S6 kinase reflects and regulates ethanol-induced sedation J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :15396-15402 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) were maintained at 26°C, in Schneider’s Drosophila media supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (ThermoFisher Cat. No 21720024).
Global NKCC1 KO mice ( Flagella et al., 1999 18. Flagella, M. ∙ Clarke, L.L. ∙ Miller, M.L. ... Mice lacking the basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter have impaired epithelial chloride secretion and are profoundly deaf J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :26946-26955 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ) and littermate controls, used only for antibody validation, were housed in a temperature-controlled room on a 12h light/dark cycle, with free access to standard diet and deionized water. Tissue from one adult male KO mouse and one adult male littermate control were used for analysis. Mice were 3-4 months of age at the time of analysis. All animal protocols related to care, sacrifice, and organ harvest conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by the University of Pittsburgh IACUC.
All mammalian WNK1 clones used for this study were derived from the original untagged rat WNK1 cDNA (AAF74258.1), which encodes a 2126 amino acid kinase-active isoform isolated from brain ( Xu et al., 2000 89. Xu, B. ∙ English, J.M. ∙ Wilsbacher, J.L. ... WNK1, a novel mammalian serine/threonine protein kinase lacking the catalytic lysine in subdomain II J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :16795-16801 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (443) PubMed Google Scholar ). This cDNA was modified to correct a variant serine present in residue 2120 of the original cDNA back to a conserved glycine to match the canonical Uniprot sequence Q9JIH7-1, and subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1. In the key resources table , this complete CDS is referred to as rWNK1-S-G, but is referred to as “full-length WNK1” in this study. C-terminal eGFP-tagged WNK1 was reported previously ( Boyd-Shiwarski et al., 2018 6. Boyd-Shiwarski, C.R. ∙ Shiwarski, D.J. ∙ Roy, A. ... Potassium-regulated distal tubule WNK bodies are kidney-specific WNK1 dependent Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29 :499-509 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate N-terminal mRuby2-tagged WNK1, a gBlock encoding mRuby2 fused to the WNK1 N-terminus via a GRGS linker was synthesized (IDT) and swapped with an EcoRI / NotI N-terminal fragment in WNK1. Truncated N-terminal mRb2 tagged 1-494 and 1-1242 fragments constructs were generated by PCR off the full-length template and ligation to linearized pcDNA3.1. The WNK1 1-494-FUS and 1-494-TDP-43 LCR chimeras were generated by amplifying cDNAs encoding residues 1-267 of FUS or residues 274-414 of TDP-43 from previously reported templates ( Mann et al., 2019 43. Mann, J.R. ∙ Gleixner, A.M. ∙ Mauna, J.C. ... RNA binding antagonizes neurotoxic phase transitions of TDP-43 Neuron. 2019; 102 321–338.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ligating them in frame to N-terminally tagged mRuby2-1-494 WNK1 in pcDNA3.1. To generate the double coiled-coil mutant, two gBlocks encoding proline substitutions in the mid and distal coiled coil domains were swapped in stepwise fashion with corresponding regions into the full length mRuby2-WNK1 construct in pcDNA3.1 via restriction cloning. To generate fluorescently tagged SPAK constructs, full-length murine SPAK cDNA (NM_016866.2) was amplified and subcloned to pcDNA3.1, and in-frame N-terminal eGFP or mRuby2 tags were PCR amplified and ligated by restriction cloning. For the Cry2 plasmids, WNK1 fragments were generated by PCR or as synthetic gBlocks and were ligated via restriction cloning to the XmaI site of linearized Cry2PHR or Cry2Olig (E490G) vectors (Addgene #26866 and #60032), positioned in-frame between the PHR domain and mCherry.
For the dmWNK constructs, a gBlock encoding Drosophila codon-optimized human kinase-dead SPAK (HsSPAK D210A ) was synthesized and inserted into the multicistronic vector pAc5 STABLE2 Neo, which contains a GFP cassette ( González et al., 2011 26. González, M. ∙ Martín-Ruíz, I. ∙ Jiménez, S. ... Generation of stable Drosophila cell lines using multicistronic vectors Sci. Rep. 2011; 1 :75 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Addgene #32426), by Gibson assembly to generate pAc5-GFP:T2A:HsSPAK D210A . dmWNK fragments were then PCR amplified from a full-length clone ( Wu et al., 2014 88. Wu, Y. ∙ Schellinger, J.N. ∙ Huang, C.L. ... Hypotonicity stimulates potassium flux through the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 kinase cascade and the Ncc69 sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter in the Drosophila renal tubule J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :26131-26142 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inserted into this vector in-frame with the GFP cassette by Gibson assembly to generate a series of N-terminal GFP-tagged dmWNK truncation constructs. To delete WNK1 from HEK-293 cells, we used a previously reported bicistronic PX330 plasmid (Addgene #42230) harboring the Cas9 CDS and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exon 1 of WNK1 ( Roy et al., 2015b 66. Roy, A. ∙ Goodman, J.H. ∙ Begum, G. ... Generation of WNK1 knockout cell lines by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2015; 308 :F366-F376 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To generate the Cas9/WNK3-sgRNA plasmid, a 20bp guide sequence (WNK3.5) targeting exon 1 of human WNK3 was ligated to the BbsI site of PX330 (PX330-WNK3.5). To confirm WNK3 sgRNA efficacy, a complementary pair of 30bp oligonucleotides spanning the WNK3.5 sgRNA target cut site were ligated to a pHRS reporter plasmid (PNABio) ( Pereira et al., 2016 56. Pereira, E.M. ∙ Labilloy, A. ∙ Eshbach, M.L. ... Characterization and phosphoproteomic analysis of a human immortalized podocyte model of Fabry disease generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2016; 311 :F1015-F1024 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate mNeonGreen WNK1 knock-in cells, a 20bp guide sequence targeting the 5’ end of WNK1 exon 1 was ligated to the BbsI site of PX459 (Addgene #62988). In addition, we generated a plasmid harboring a homology-directed repair knock-in template by inserting the mNeonGreen CDS and 5’ and 3’ homology arms flanking the WNK1 insertion site into pUC18 via overlap extension PCR and Gibson assembly. The homology arms were amplified from extracted HEK-293 cell genomic DNA (QuickExtract DNA extraction solution, Lucigen). The fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by Sanger or Nanopore sequencing prior to use.
For HEK-293 and U2OS cells, plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher) per manufacturer instructions. If transfected cells were used for imaging, they were re-plated on coverslips or MatTek dishes 24h post-transfection. For S2-Gal4 cells, Drosophila constructs were transfected with plasmid DNA using TransIT®-Insect transfection reagent (Mirus Bio).
WNK1/WNK3 double knockout (DKO) HEK-293 cells were generated via methods similar to ( Roy et al., 2015b 66. Roy, A. ∙ Goodman, J.H. ∙ Begum, G. ... Generation of WNK1 knockout cell lines by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2015; 308 :F366-F376 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were grown in 6-well dishes, cotransfected with WNK1-PX330 plasmid and pEGFP-N1, used as a fluorescent marker for sorting transfected cells. 48h later, cells were harvested in PBS + 2% FBS, dilutely sorted into 96-well plates using a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences), and clonally expanded. Knockout clones were identified by immunoblotting with validated WNK1 antibodies ( Figure S2 and Boyd-Shiwarski et al., 2018 6. Boyd-Shiwarski, C.R. ∙ Shiwarski, D.J. ∙ Roy, A. ... Potassium-regulated distal tubule WNK bodies are kidney-specific WNK1 dependent Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29 :499-509 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). To knock out WNK3, the WNK3.5 sgRNA was first functionally validated using a surrogate reporter method ( Pereira et al., 2016 56. Pereira, E.M. ∙ Labilloy, A. ∙ Eshbach, M.L. ... Characterization and phosphoproteomic analysis of a human immortalized podocyte model of Fabry disease generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2016; 311 :F1015-F1024 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ramakrishna et al., 2014 61. Ramakrishna, S. ∙ Cho, S.W. ∙ Kim, S. ... Surrogate reporter-based enrichment of cells containing RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease-induced mutations Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3378 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). PX330-WNK3.5 was cotransfected into HEK-293 cells with pHRS-WNK3.5, a reporter plasmid that harbors an out-of-frame GFP cassette 3’ to the target cut site. On-plasmid CRISPR-mediated nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) shifts the GFP CDS in-frame, resulting in green fluorescence, which was confirmed for cells expressing the WNK3.5 sgRNA by epifluorescence microscopy 48h post transfection. The PX330-WNK3.5 plasmid was then used to knock out WNK3 from WNK1 KO cells using methods identical to those described for WNK1 deletion.
To generate endogenous mNG-tagged WNK1 cells, PX459-WNK1, encoding Cas9 and WNK1-sgRNA, was cotransfected with the pUC18-WNK1/mNeonGreen homology directed repair template plasmid. 72h post-transfection, cells were sorted by FACS for mNeonGreen fluorescence, plated dilutely into 96-well plates, and clonally expanded. Individual clones were validated by immunoblotting for WNK1 and the mNG tag, and by amplification of the target site across the 5’ and 3’ homology arms by genomic PCR, TA cloning into pGEM-Teasy (Promega), and Sanger sequencing.
To generate the guinea pig total NKCC1 antibody, we targeted amino acids 929-999 of mouse NKCC1 (NCBI NP_033220.2; CCDS 37826.1). This epitope is contained within a unique loop of the NKCC1 C-terminus, and is distinct from sequences in other SLC12 cotransporters, including the closely related NKCC2 ( SLC12A1 ) ( Carmosino et al., 2008 8. Carmosino, M. ∙ Giménez, I. ∙ Caplan, M. ... Exon loss accounts for differential sorting of Na-K-Cl cotransporters in polarized epithelial cells Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19 :4341-4351 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). A fusion protein encoding the NKCC1 epitope fused to GST was expressed by IPTG induction in BL21 E.coli, purified using a HiTrap glutathione S-Transferase column, and eluted with 10mM reduced glutathione. The free glutathione was removed by overnight dialysis and purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Antibody production in guinea pigs was carried out by Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory (Canadensis, PA). Validation of the antibody in global NKCC1 KO mice ( Flagella et al., 1999 18. Flagella, M. ∙ Clarke, L.L. ∙ Miller, M.L. ... Mice lacking the basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter have impaired epithelial chloride secretion and are profoundly deaf J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :26946-26955 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ) is shown in Figure S1 A. We were unable to detect phosphorylated NKCC1 using several commercial antibodies; therefore, we used a previously validated antibody that was directed to phosphorylated Threonine-58 of NCC ( SLC12A3 ) ( Sorensen et al., 2013 79. Sorensen, M.V. ∙ Grossmann, S. ∙ Roesinger, M. ... Rapid dephosphorylation of the renal sodium chloride cotransporter in response to oral potassium intake in mice Kidney Int. 2013; 83 :811-824 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). The epitope recognized by this antibody (amino acids 54-62 of mouse NCC; FGHYNpTIDVV) cross-reacts with a phospho-activation site present in mouse NKCC2 and NKCC1 ( Giménez and Forbush, 2003 25. Giménez, I. ∙ Forbush, B. Short-term stimulation of the renal Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) by vasopressin involves phosphorylation and membrane translocation of the protein J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :26946-26951 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2013 36. Lee, D.H. ∙ Maunsbach, A.B. ∙ Riquier-Brison, A.D. ... Effects of ACE inhibition and ANG II stimulation on renal Na-Cl cotransporter distribution, phosphorylation, and membrane complex properties Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2013; 304 :C147-C163 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phosphorylation at this site is a signature of NKCC activation ( Flemmer et al., 2002 19. Flemmer, A.W. ∙ Gimenez, I. ∙ Dowd, B.F. ... Activation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter NKCC1 detected with a phospho-specific antibody J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :37551-37558 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, the pT58 antibody was used to provide a readout of activated NKCC1 in HEK-293 cells. TIAR was detected using a previously reported antibody ( Daigle et al., 2016 10. Daigle, J.G. ∙ Krishnamurthy, K. ∙ Ramesh, N. ... Pur-alpha regulates cytoplasmic stress granule dynamics and ameliorates FUS toxicity Acta Neuropathol. 2016; 131 :605-620 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
HEK-293 cells were plated in 6-well dishes in complete media and allowed to grow to 80-90% confluency. Cells were transfected in antibiotic-free media the following day with standardized amounts of mRuby2 tagged WNK1 plasmids. Cells were re-plated 24h post-transfection on poly-D-lysine coated MatTek dishes. Tonic solutions and media were prepared and warmed to 37°C on the day of imaging. Cell media was replaced with Leibovitz L-15 media and dish was loaded into a climate-controlled stage set to 38°C of a Leica SP8 live cell resonant scanning confocal microscope using a Leica HC Pl APO CS2 63X, 1.40 numerical aperture oil objective. Scan speed was set to 1000 Hz and images were captured in a 2048x2048 resolution format. Cells were screened and selected for imaging with similar mRuby2 signal intensities to evaluate condensate behavior in cells with relatively equal amounts of WNK1 protein by taking an intensity measurement in Fiji prior to imaging. Stress media (50 mM sorbitol) was added after the second stack was taken to establish a pre-stress baseline. Confocal stacks (10-18 steps, 1μm step size) capturing mRuby2 signal were taken every 15 seconds for 10 minutes.
Spinning disk confocal fluorescence live cell imaging was performed on a Nikon Ti-E-2000 inverted microscope equipped with an Andor Revolution XDi spinning disk, a 100X objective (Nikon CFI Plan Apo TIRF Lambda, 1.49 NA), Piezo XYZ stage (Nikon), iXon 897 Ultra back-illuminated camera (Andor Technology), a laser combiner (Andor Technology) containing 405, 488, 515, 568, and 647 nm excitation capabilities, Perfect Focus system (Nikon), a Dell 5400 Workstation with IQ2 imaging software (Andor Technology), and an active isolation air table (TMC) ( Shiwarski et al., 2019 76. Shiwarski, D.J. ∙ Crilly, S.E. ∙ Dates, A. ... Dual RXR motifs regulate nerve growth factor-mediated intracellular retention of the delta Opioid receptor Mol. Biol. Cell. 2019; 30 :680-690 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). The system was surrounded by a full heated enclosure to maintain physiological temperature and humidity. eGFP and mRuby WNK1 expressing cells were grown on coverslips and transferred to a metal imaging chamber (AttoFlour, Invitrogen) in Leibovitz’s L-15 media + 1% FBS. eGFP and mRuby were imaged using 488 nm laser excitation with 525/50 nm emission filter, and 561 nm laser excitation with 620/60 nm emission filter, respectively. Exposure duration, laser power, camera gain, and Z-step sizes were optimized to achieve fast 3D imaging at Nyquist resolution of WNK1 condensate formation while minimizing photobleaching during the time-lapse imaging. 3D rendering of the image stacks were performed using the IQ2 built-in animation features and Imaris software (Bitplane).
For live cell imaging in Drosophila S2-Gal4 cells, 48 hours following transfection, cells expressing GFP-dmWNK constructs were resuspended and transferred in 500 μl aliquots to 1.5mL centrifuge tubes. The cell suspension was then diluted stepwise with water in 10% increments over 20 minutes to a final concentration of 60% cell media to 40% water (174 mOsm). 100 μl of the diluted cell/media mixture was then transferred to 8-well live cell imaging plates (Ibidi, Cat. No. 80827), mixed with water (hypotonic condition, 87mOsm, to completely dissolve condensates) or sorbitol (Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. BP439-500) (hypertonic condition, 376 mOsm, final sorbitol concentration 250 mM) and allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes. In some experiments, sorbitol was added to achieve varying concentrations. Osmolality was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Vapro 5520, Wescor). Cells were imaged using an Olympus CKX53 inverted fluorescence microscope with excitation between 488 nm and 510 nm using the 40X objective and representative images were captured. The GFP channel was isolated and converted to inverted grayscale images in Fiji. For puncta counting experiments, the fraction (percentage) of cells with condensates was quantified by counting the number of cells with condensates and dividing by total number of cells at varying osmolalities. Movies of transfected S2 cells were acquired with a Leica SP8 with 405, 488, 561, and 633 nm laser lines, using a HC PL APO CS2 63x, 1.4 numerical aperture oil objective with a 1x zoom factor. Images were acquired in an 8-bit 1024x1024 resolution format with 1 frame average and 2 line averages while scanning at 200 Hz.
Cells were plated on Biocoat coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. Hypertonic stress media and fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in hypertonic stress media) solutions were warmed to 37° C. Media was aspirated off and hypertonic stress media was applied to cells. Cells were incubated in stress media in a 37°C CO 2 incubator for 5 minutes. The stress media was aspirated and warmed hypertonic fixative was applied to cells for 15 minutes at 37° C. Following fixation, the paraformaldehyde was quenched with 50mM NH4Cl, and the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Following washing with PBS w/ Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ (PBS +/+ ) the cells were incubated for 1h at room temperature with blocking solution containing FBS and fish gelatin (1% w/vol). Primary antibody was diluted in block solution and applied overnight at 4°C. The next day, following washes with block solution, fluorescent secondary antibodies (diluted in block solution) were applied in the dark for 2h at room temperature. Following additional washes in block solution, cells were stained with a To-Pro3 in block solution (diluted 1:5000; Invitrogen, T3605) at room temperature for 20 minutes. After a final set of washes, coverslips were mounted onto slides using ProLong Glass (Invitrogen, P36980).
For standard confocal microscopy, images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 CW-STED with 488, 552, and 633 nm laser lines, using a HCX PL APO CS 40x, 1.25 numerical aperture oil objective with a 4x zoom factor. Images were acquired in a 12-bit 1024x1024 resolution format with 4 frame averages and 8 line averages. Crosstalk between channels was mitigated with sequential channel scanning. Confocal images with high-resolution adaptive deconvolution processing were obtained with a Leica Stellaris 8 FALCON FLIM white light laser scanning confocal microscope, using a Leica HC Pl APO CS2 63X, 1.40 numerical aperture oil objective with a 3x zoom factor. mNeonGreen and mRuby2-specific spectra were imported to LAS-X from FPBase. Scan speed was set to 400Hz and images were captured in a 2048x2048 resolution 16-bit format with 4 line averages. Confocal images were processed adaptively using Lightning deconvolution software (Leica). Sequential scanning was used to prevent channel crosstalk. In all cases, multiple confocal fields were obtained from at least two biological replicates, obtained over the course of 2-3 independent experiments.
HEK293 cells were grown in 6-well dishes and transfected with full-length mRuby2-WNK1. 24h post-transfection, cells were re-plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated MatTek dishes and allowed to grow for an additional 24h. Growth media was then replaced with complete media supplemented with 500mM sorbitol (hypertonic). All cells were incubated in a 37-degree CO 2 incubator for 3 minutes before applying fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in isotonic or hypertonic media, respectively) at 37°C for 1h. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS at room temperature without agitation and stored in PBS at 4°C until imaged.
Fluorescent images were taken on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. Samples were first imaged with a 0.50NA 10x objective using the "ND Acquisition + Large Images" addon to create a stitched montage of images of the entire coverslip, exciting with a 561nm laser and collecting through a 595/50 filter. Regions of interest were reimaged with a 1.40NA 60x objective using Nyquist sampling (0.21μm/px) and a 3x3 stitched large image in a 20μm z-stack with 0.17μm steps. A straight scratch through the sample made with a pipette tip was used as a fiduciary mark for later alignment with the SEM data.
Following high-resolution confocal field-of-view imaging, the samples underwent post-fixation and en bloc heavy metal staining to prepare for the SEM backscatter imaging. The samples were first placed in a 1% OsO4 solution for 20 minutes, followed by three 5-minute PBS washes. Next, the samples were then placed in a 1% Tannic Acid solution for 10 minutes, followed by three 5-minute ddH 2 O washes. Finally, the samples were then placed in a second 1% OsO4 solution for 15 minutes followed by three 5-minute ddH 2 O washes. Samples were then stained en bloc with aqueous 2% uranyl acetate for two hours at room temperature followed by three 5-minute ddH 2 O washes. The final en bloc stain used was a lead aspartate solution placed on the samples and incubated at 60°C for one hour followed by three 5-minute ddH 2 O washes. After post-fixation and en bloc staining, the samples were be dehydrated and embedded in resin. Samples were dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol; 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100%, followed by infiltration with four 1-hour changes of EPON embedding resin ( Franks et al., 2017 21. Franks, J. ∙ Wallace, C.T. ∙ Shibata, M. ... Correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy in 3D-scanning electron microscope perspective Curr. Protoc. Cytom. 2017; 80 :12.45.1-12.45.15 Google Scholar ). Pre-formed resin blocks that fit the SEM stage are pressed into the unpolymerized resin of the samples and allowed to polymerize at 37°C for 24 hours and then 65°C for 48 hours. Once the samples were acclimated to room temperature, the coverslip from the MatTek cell dish was removed with a freeze/thaw method, alternating the dish briefly sitting in liquid N 2 and 100°C H 2 O until the glass coverslip was removable.
The sample block was then transferred to the SEM holder and polished with a JEOL Handy Lap with a ThorLabs 0.3μm Calcined Alumina Lapping Sheet. Roughly 20 strokes of the Handy Lap were adequate to remove the outer membrane of the embedded cells. The sample was then coated in carbon and placed in the JEOL JSM-7800 SEM equipped with a backscatter detector for imaging. Samples were SEM imaged at 7kV. A 250x montage of the entire face of the block was taken in order to align with the 10x fluorescent image montage. The polishing, carbon coating, and 250x SEM imaging was repeated until fiduciary marks could be identified and the precise location on both the SEM and fluorescent data could be established and correlated. Once the areas where the 60x confocal fluorescent images were taken and identified, SEM montage of the regions of interest were taken at 10Kx or 15Kx. Polishing, carbon-coating, and 10Kx or 15Kx SEM montage imaging was also repeated until cellular level fiduciary marks could be identified within the Z-planes of the fluorescent images and aligned. The high magnification SEM montages were stitched using Nikon Elements software and the Fluorescent and EM data were aligned.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies were performed during live confocal fluorescence microscopy as previously reported ( Boyd-Shiwarski et al., 2018 6. Boyd-Shiwarski, C.R. ∙ Shiwarski, D.J. ∙ Roy, A. ... Potassium-regulated distal tubule WNK bodies are kidney-specific WNK1 dependent Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29 :499-509 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the imaging system described above. Images were acquired with 100X objective (Nikon CFI Plan Apo TIRF Lambda, 1.49 NA) every 300 ms for 1 min. FRAP was performed using an Andor FRAPPA unit with the 488 nm laser at 100% power, 100 μs dwell time and two repeats for each spot. Image series were imported into FIJI ImageJ for analysis. To calculate the percent recovery after photobleaching we normalized the bleached region to a control non-bleached region over time. The initial fluorescence intensity of the condensate prior to photobleaching was averaged and used to normalize the data. To isolate the recovery of the mobile fraction, the minimum fluorescence intensity for each region was subtracted from the normalized fluorescence intensity over time, and normalized to constrain the prebleach signal intensity to 100% and the post bleach intensity to 0%. Data was plotted as percent recovery vs. time in seconds using Prism 9 (GraphPad).
All optogenetic live-cell imaging experiments were performed on a Nikon A1 laser-scanning confocal microscope system outfitted with a Tokai HIT stagetop incubator utilizing 40X and/or 60X oil immersion objectives (CFI Plan Apo Lambda 60X Oil, Nikon). Following transfections and/or treatments, medium was changed to phenol red-free growth medium (GIBCO) and cells were allowed to equilibrate on the preheated (37°C and 5% CO2) stagetop incubator for 10 min prior to imaging. Acute blue light stimulation was achieved by utilizing the 488nm laser line and the stimulation module within Nikon Elements imaging software. Activation duration was set to 1s and laser power was set at 20%. Stimulation regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over fields of view prior to image acquisition. Following 2-5 baseline images, laser stimulation was performed and cells were imaged for up to 10 min post-activation. Timing and order of image acquisition was alternated across experiments between experimental groups. Data presented are representative of at least two independent experiments utilizing three or more biological replicates per experiment.
Cells were transiently transfected with mRb2-tagged WNK1 constructs. 24h later, the cells were re-plated on poly-D-lysine coated MatTek dishes. The following day (∼48h post transfection), media was replaced with 1mL pre-warmed Leibovitz L-15 media. Dishes were mounted into an environmental stage set to 38°C on an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope with a HC PL APO CS2 63X, 1.40 numerical aperture oil objective. 6x6 tile scans were obtained every 60 seconds for 10 minutes. The scan speed was set to 700 Hz with resonant scanning deactivated, and images were acquired in a 2048x2048 resolution format. Fixed laser power for the 552 nm laser line was set using the 1-494 mRuby2 tagged WNK1 construct as this was the most highly expressed construct, and thus the brightest. This was done to minimize oversaturation in each set of transfected cells. Stress media was added after a pre-stress tile scan was completed to obtain baseline fluorescence intensities. The stresses were composed of Leibovitz media with varying amounts of sorbitol, ranging from 50 mM (350mOsm) to 250 mM (550mOsm).
In each of the tile images, mRuby2-fluorescent cells that were clearly captured within the field of view for the duration of the stress time course were identified, assigned an identification number for blinded evaluation ( Figure S4 A), and pre-stress intensities were measured in FIJI. The blinded image sets were categorized by stress condition and transfected WNK1 construct but were deidentified via a randomized coding system prior to passing them on to three independent screeners. The screeners scored the degree of phase separation (no phase separation, nucleation, and spinodal decomposition) for each numbered cell. Score discrepancies were re-evaluated by the screeners as a group on a case-by-case basis to arrive at consensus. Following unblinding, data points were plotted on a graph with protein concentration on the X-axis, and osmolality on the Y-axis to compose phase diagrams. Binodal phase boundaries were drawn at the level of pre-stress fluorescence intensity where the WNK1 constructs uniformly adopted a nucleated morphology following exposure to osmotic stress, and spinodal phase boundaries were drawn in similar fashion for constructs that underwent post-stress spinodal decomposition.
To examine the natively expressed WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway under hyperosmotic stress, unedited HEK-293 cells or endogenous mNG-tagged WNK1 cells were grown in 6-well dishes. Once cells reached 90% confluence (∼24h), growth media (complete) was replaced with fresh complete media supplemented with various amounts of sorbitol. Following the application of isotonic or stress media, cells were incubated in a 37-degree CO 2 incubator for 5 minutes, and then harvested (∼5 minutes) in the same applied isotonic or stress media. Collected samples were immediately pelleted at 4°C for 5 minutes and the supernatant discarded, totaling 15 minutes of exposure to osmotic stress. For experiments with transfected WNK1 constructs, WNK1/WNK3 DKO cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected, in duplicate, with varying amounts (0.5-3.5ng) of one of the following mRuby2-tagged WNK1 constructs: full-length,1-494 fragment, 1-1242 fragment, or the double coiled-coil mutant. Based on pilot studies, transfection amounts were adjusted to minimize differences in protein expression among each of the constructs. 24h post-transfection, cells were re-plated, dividing each well of transfected cells in two. After an additional 24h, growth media (complete) from one divided well was replaced with fresh complete media (iso), and growth media from the second divided well replaced with complete media supplemented with 50mM sorbitol (hyper). Cells were placed in a 37-degree CO 2 incubator for 20 minutes and then harvested in the same applied media (∼5 minutes). Collected samples were immediately pelleted at 4°C for 5 minutes and the supernatant discarded, totaling 30 minutes of exposure to osmotic stress. All other unedited cells and candidate clones were washed with chilled DPBS and collected in chilled PBS supplemented with protease (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and phosphatase (Roche) inhibitor cocktails. Collected samples were immediately pelleted at 4°C for 5 minutes.
Cytosolic proteins were extracted from cell pellets with ice-cold Detergent Lysis Buffer (50mM Tris-Hcl pH 8.0, 1% IGEPAL CA 630, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 62.5mM EDTA, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 minutes before pelleting out insoluble materials via hard centrifugation at 4°C for 10 minutes. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein (20ug) were denatured in Laemmli buffer, maintained at room temperature for 10 minutes, and loaded onto 4-20% Criterion TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad) alongside Precision Plus All Blue Standard (Bio-Rad) for SDS-PAGE. Once separated, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo for immunoblotting. The resulting signal was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence and measured using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imager.
For immunoblotting data obtained in transfected osmotically stressed cells, gel lanes represent individual biological replicates, and are representative of data obtained over three to five independent experiments, which were used for quantification and statistical analysis.
For protein isolation from tissue, whole kidney and brain cortex was homogenized in ice-cold RIPA extraction buffer (Thermo Scientific) with freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Following agitation at 4°C for 30min, homogenates were centrifuged and supernatants were collected. Equal amounts of protein, as determined by BCA protein assay, were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 4-15% Criterion TGX precast gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with NKCC1 antibody, as described above. ECL signal was visualized by autoradiography.
HEK-293 WNK1/WNK3 DKO cells were plated in 6-well dishes in complete media and allowed to grow to 80-90% confluency. Cells were transfected in antibiotic-free media the following day with standardized amounts of mRuby2 tagged WNK1 plasmids and pEGFP-N1. Since eGFP distributes uniformly throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm, it was used as a fluorescent marker for transfected cell volume. Cells were re-plated 24h post-transfection on poly-D-lysine coated MatTek dishes. Tonic solutions and media were prepared and warmed to 37°C on the day of imaging. Cell media was replaced with Leibovitz L-15 media supplemented with 10 μM Cariporide, with or without 20 μM Bumetanide. Both cariporide and bumetanide were solubilized in DMSO; the addition of these inhibitors increased osmolality by 7 and 13mOsm, respectively. Following a 10 min preincubation period, the plated cells were imaged with a Leica SP8 live cell resonant scanning confocal microscope on a climate-controlled stage set to 38°C. Confocal stacks (20-30 steps, 2μm step size) capturing whole-cell eGFP signal were taken with a Leica 40x, 1.1 numerical aperture water immersion objective every 30 seconds for 20 minutes at a scan speed of 8000Hz. For each experimental condition, a control set of calibration measurements was taken to account for natural drift in cell volume in Leibowitz media on the heated stage over a 20-minute time course. To evaluate volume changes after hypertonic stress, following the first 60 seconds of imaging, sorbitol was added to achieve a final concentration of 50mM, which increased solution osmolality by 50mOsm. Confocal stacks were rendered in the LasX 3D software platform. Uncommonly, field boundaries were cropped during post-processing to exclude floating cells that would confound volume calculations. Following background subtraction, Otsu thresholding was applied to obtain binary images. The integrated binary whole-cell GFP signal from each confocal stack was used to calculate the percent cell volume per imaging field; this reliably reflected volumetric changes over the time course.
For cell volume calculations, percent volume per field measurements were normalized to 100% at time zero. Changes in cell volume over time were adjusted by the control set of drift calibration measurements. RVI was defined as the percent volume recovery during the time course following exposure to hypertonic stress. To account for variability in baseline volume reduction after hypertonic exposure, this percentage was expressed relative to the volume lost, using the following equation: 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁡ ( 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑉 ⁢ 𝐼 ) = [ ( 𝑉 𝑡 𝑉 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ) − 1 ( 𝑉 0 − 𝑉 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ) ] × 1 0 0 , where V0 = the volume at time zero (normalized to 1), Vmin = the minimal fractional cell volume measured immediately following exposure to hypertonicity, and Vt = the fractional cell volume at a given time point during the RVI phase.
WNK1/3 DKO cells expressing full-length or 1-494 WNK1 were cultured in PDL coated 24-well plates with DMEM culture media until 90% confluent. The culture medium was removed and cells were rinsed with an isotonic buffer (310 mOsm, containing 134 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0.8 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 5 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES and 1.66 mM MgSO 4 ) as described before ( Luo et al., 2020 41. Luo, L. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Ding, D. ... Role of NKCC1 activity in glioma K(+) homeostasis and cell growth: new insights with the bumetanide-derivative STS66 Front. Physiol. 2020; 11 :911 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). To measure basal K + (Rb + ) influx, cells were exposed to the isotonic buffer (310 mOsm, pH 7.4, containing 5.36 mM Rb + ,) in the absence or presence of NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (BMT, 10 μM), for 10 min at 37°C. To measure changes of Rb + influx in HEK293 cells in response to hypertonic stress, cells were exposed to the hypertonic solution (370 mOsm adjusted by adding 60 mM sucrose, pH 7.4, 5.36 mM Rb + ) for 5 min at 37°C. To terminate Rb + influx, cells were washed with the isotonic or hypertonic washing solutions (Rb + free) and lysed with 200 mL 0.15% SDS (room temperature) to release the intracellular Rb + . The intracellular Rb + concentration in cell lysates was measured using an automated atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Ion Channel Reader, ICR-8000; Aurora Biomed, Vancouver, Canada). Total protein of cell lysates was measured by BCA assay. Rb + influx rate was calculated and expressed as mg Rb + /mg protein/min. NKCC1-mediated Rb + influx was determined by subtracting Rb + influx value in the presence of bumetanide from the total Rb + influx. To calculate shrinkage-induced bumetanide-sensitive Rb+ flux, we subtracted the baseline bumetanide-sensitive Rb+ transport measured under isotonic conditions (310mOsm), from the increase in bumetanide-sensitive Rb+ transport measured under hypertonic conditions (370mOsm).
Borosilicate glass filaments (O.D. 1.2 mm, I.D. 0.94 mm, 10cm length, Catalog #: BF120-94-10 Sutter Instrument) were pulled into micropipettes using a Sutter Instrument P-1000. A potassium acetate HEPES buffer (KH buffer, 125 mM K+ Acetate, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), was prepared as the vehicle for microinjection and 1.5 μL was backfilled into the pulled micropipettes ( Shiwarski et al., 2017 77. Shiwarski, D.J. ∙ Darr, M. ∙ Telmer, C.A. ... PI3K class II alpha regulates delta-opioid receptor export from the trans-Golgi network Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 :2202-2219 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). For isosmotic injections, stock KH buffer was injected into mNG-WNK1 cells using an Eppendorf FemtoJet (pi = 35 hPa, ti(s) = 0.2, pc(hPa) = 20) and InjectMan micromanipulators on a Nikon Ti-E-2000. Widefield fluorescence imaging and brightfield DIC was performed using a 100X objective (Nikon CFI Plan Apo TIRF Lambda, 1.49 NA), a GFP excitation/emission filter cube (Nikon), a stage top incubator (TokaiHIT), and a Prime 95B camera (Photometrics) run with Micro-Manager software ( Edelstein et al., 2014 16. Edelstein, A.D. ∙ Tsuchida, M.A. ∙ Amodaj, N. ... Advanced methods of microscope control using μManager software J. Biol. Methods. 2014; 1 :e10 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Time-lapse imaging (300 ms exposure, 30 s interval, for 15 min) was performed at 37°C prior to and during injection. A hyperosmotic solution was prepared by adding KCl (100 mM) 1:1 to the KH buffer to yield a 50 mM final concentration. To induce molecular crowding, a Ficoll solution (50% w/v Ficoll PM400, GE Healthcare, in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4) was combined 1:1 with the KH buffer and microinjected into the cells as described for the isosmotic condition. In experiments injecting multiple solutions into the same cells, micropipettes were preloaded prior to the experiment and exchanged between treatments. Image analysis was performed using FIJI.
Isotonic cell size measurements were carried out with an Amnis ImageStream flow cytometer (Luminex), based on previously published methods ( Samsel et al., 2013 67. Samsel, L. ∙ Dagur, P.K. ∙ Raghavachari, N. ... Imaging flow cytometry for morphologic and phenotypic characterization of rare circulating endothelial cells Cytometry B. 2013; 84 :379-389 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). mRuby2-tagged full length WNK1 and WNK1-1-494 were transiently transfected in HEK-293 cells. Transfected cells were harvested in Leibovitz L-15 media (Gibco) 48h post transfection. Before analyzing the transfected cells, the cells were further diluted with FACS buffer. mRuby2 fluorescence signal was detected by using a filter with wavelength 642-745nm. At least 8000 images were collected per transfection replicate. From each transfection replicate, around 10-15000 events meeting the cell classifier were acquired. Each replicate acquisition file was analyzed using IDEAS 5.0 software (Amnis corporation, Seattle, WA). A hierarchical gating strategy was used to identify single cells. Doublets were eliminated by gating on single cells using intensity versus aspect ratio brightfield plot. Single cells have higher aspect ratio as compared to the doublets or aggregates. The mean area or size of single cells was determined in microns (μm) by using IDEAS software.
We used three algorithms to predict WNK protein disorder: SPOT-Disorder ( Hanson et al., 2017 28. Hanson, J. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Paliwal, K. ... Improving protein disorder prediction by deep bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :685-692 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), VSL2B ( Obradovic et al., 2005 49. Obradovic, Z. ∙ Peng, K. ∙ Vucetic, S. ... Exploiting heterogeneous sequence properties improves prediction of protein disorder Proteins. 2005; 61 :176-182 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ), and VL3H ( Peng et al., 2005 55. Peng, K. ∙ Vucetic, S. ∙ Radivojac, P. ... Optimizing long intrinsic disorder predictors with protein evolutionary information J. Bioinform. Comput. Biol. 2005; 3 :35-60 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). SEG was used to predict low complexity regions (LCRs) ( Wootton, 1994 87. Wootton, J.C. Non-globular domains in protein sequences: automated segmentation using complexity measures Comput. Chem. 1994; 18 :269-285 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ). Short, medium, and long low-complexity segments were defined as having trigger window length (W), trigger complexity (K 2 (1)) and extension complexity (K 2 (2)) parameters of 12/2.2/2.5, 25/3.0/3.3, and 45/3.4/3.75, respectively. NCoils ( Lupas et al., 1991 42. Lupas, A. ∙ Van Dyke, M. ∙ Stock, J. Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences Science. 1991; 252 :1162-1164 Crossref Scopus (3611) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a sliding window of 21 or 28 residues was used to predict coiled-coil domains. Marcoil ( Delorenzi and Speed, 2002 13. Delorenzi, M. ∙ Speed, T. An HMM model for coiled-coil domains and a comparison with PSSM-based predictions Bioinformatics. 2002; 18 :617-625 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to predict CC heptad registers in rat WNK1. Prion-like domains (PLDs) were predicted using PLAAC ( Lancaster et al., 2014 35. Lancaster, A.K. ∙ Nutter-Upham, A. ∙ Lindquist, S. ... PLAAC: a web and command-line application to identify proteins with prion-like amino acid composition Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2501-2502 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). A default core length of 60 and a relative alpha of 50% was used. Similar results were obtained when the relative background frequency alpha for S. cerevesiae was adjusted to 0% (i.e., 100% for the species being scored: human, rat, Drosophila , or C. elegans ).
Details on the protein sequences used to analyze cross-species amino acid compositional bias in WNK CTDs are provided in the Mendeley dataset. In most cases, UniprotKb was used to identify specific WNK kinases. Once the sequence for a putative WNK kinase was found, we confirmed its identity by verifying that the kinase domain contained the atypically placed catalytic lysine ( Min et al., 2004 45. Min, X. ∙ Lee, B.H. ∙ Cobb, M.H. ... Crystal structure of the kinase domain of WNK1, a kinase that causes a hereditary form of hypertension Structure. 2004; 12 :1303-1311 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ) and chloride binding pocket that are defining features of the WNKs ( Piala et al., 2014 57. Piala, A.T. ∙ Moon, T.M. ∙ Akella, R. ... Chloride sensing by WNK1 involves inhibition of autophosphorylation Sci. Signal. 2014; 7 :ra41 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CTD was defined as the sequence downstream from the predicted PF2-like domain. Amino acid frequencies within the CTD were stratified using the Expasy ProtParam tool.
Statistical details of experiments, including n, P-values, and specifics regarding post-hoc testing can be found in the figures, figure legends, and methods. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software and are presented as mean ± SEM. Comparisons between two groups were determined by Student’s t-test. Multiple comparisons were determined by one- or two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc testing as indicated in the figure legends. RVI time series data were analyzed by repeated measures two-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak’s post test. Significance criterion was set at a P-value of ≤0.05. For colocalization studies in fixed cells, percent colocalization was determined by thresholded Mander’s Overlap Coefficients, using the JaCOP plugin in FIJI.
