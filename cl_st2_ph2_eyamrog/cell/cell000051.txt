Title: Complement Signals Determine Opposite Effects of B Cells in Chemotherapy-Induced Immunity


Abstract: Summary

Understanding molecular mechanisms that dictate B cell diversity is important for targeting B cells as anti-cancer treatment. Through the single-cell dissection of B cell heterogeneity in longitudinal samples of patients with breast cancer before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we revealed that an ICOSL + B cell subset emerges after chemotherapy. Using three immunocompetent mouse models, we recapitulated the subset switch of human tumor-infiltrating B cells during chemotherapy. By employing B-cell-specific deletion mice, we showed that ICOSL in B cells boosts anti-tumor immunity by enhancing the effector to regulatory T cell ratio. The signature of ICOSL + B cells is imprinted by complement-CR2 signaling, which is triggered by immunogenic cell death. Moreover, we identified that CD55, a complement inhibitory protein, determines the opposite roles of B cells in chemotherapy. Collectively, we demonstrated a critical role of the B cell subset switch in chemotherapy response, which has implications in designing novel anti-cancer therapies.

Therefore, combinational strategies of immunotherapy and conventional treatments guided by biomarkers in the TME pave the way for the next generation of precision medicine.
B lymphocytes constitute a major population of immune cells in the TME and promote tumor progression by the immune complex ( Affara et al., 2014; Andreu et al., 2010 1.

More importantly, animal experiments ( Bodogai et al., 2013 8. Bodogai, M. ∙ Lee Chang, C. ∙ Wejksza, K. ...

Rituximab efficiently depletes B cells in lung tumors and normal lung tissue F1000Res. 2016; 5 :38 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), an anti-CD20 antibody, show that the depletion of total B cells may have detrimental impacts on antitumor immunity. Together, these conflicting observations strongly suggest that B cells in tumors consist of different subpopulations with opposite functions. However, the detailed understanding of B cells’ diversity in tumors is limited, and the underlying mechanisms of their pro- or anti-tumor phenotype switch remain largely unknown.
Here, we provide a comprehensive single-cell RNA profile analysis of tumor-infiltrating B cells in paired clinical samples of pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We identify a distinct B cell subset emerging after chemotherapy and reveal how this subset affects anti-tumor immunity.

Section: Results

Neoadjuvant therapy allows direct intra-patient evaluation, which reveals the impact of treatments on the TME. To evaluate the transcriptome of B cells in human tumors experiencing chemotherapy at single-cell resolution, we isolated 998 B cells from pre-treatment biopsy samples and 1,499 B cells from the paired post-treatment resected samples of four patients with breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) involving a single-tube protocol with unique transcript counting through barcoding with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), 34.1 million unique transcripts of over 23,074 genes were obtained. Seven unique clusters were identified by using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Consistent with previous reports ( Horikawa et al., 2011 25. Horikawa, M. ∙ Minard-Colin, V. ∙ Matsushita, T. ... Regulatory B cell production of IL-10 inhibits lymphoma depletion during CD20 immunotherapy in mice J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :4268-4280 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ), most of the clusters had strong expression of IL-10 before chemotherapy. Interestingly, the percentage of these clusters was markedly reduced in paired samples after chemotherapy ( Figures 1 A–1D).
By contrast, one cluster, which accounted for less than 1% of B cells in treatment-naive tumors, constituted 45.1% of tumor-infiltrating B cells after chemotherapy ( Figures 1 A–1D). Among the genes coding for transmembrane proteins at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1% differentially expressed when compared with other clusters, ICOSLG (ICOSL) ( Figure 1 C), which has been reported to be mainly expressed in myeloid cells, is required for the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy ( Aicher et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2016b 2. Aicher, A. ∙ Hayden-Ledbetter, M. ∙ Brady, W.A. ... Characterization of human inducible costimulator ligand expression and function J. Immunol. 2000; 164 :4689-4696 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar 66. Zhang, Y. ∙ Luo, Y. ∙ Qin, S.L. ... The clinical impact of ICOS signal in colorectal cancer patients OncoImmunology. 2016; 5 :e1141857 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). After gating to eliminate dead cells ( Figure S1 A), flow cytometric analysis validated that ICOSL delineated a B cell subset, which dramatically increased in tumors after chemotherapy, especially in the hormone receptor (HR) − Her2 − (triple-negative) subtype ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Additionally, this cluster exhibited high expression of CR2 and low expression of IL-10 ( Figure 1 C), which were also validated by flow cytometry ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 B). More than 80% of ICOSL + B cells exhibited a CD20 + CD38 + CD27 + IgA − IgD − phenotype ( Figure 1 G). Moreover, ICOSL + B cells increased in the blood of HR − patients ( Figures 1 H and 1I), whereas total B cells remained unchanged ( Figure S1 C). Collectively, these data indicate that an ICOSL + CR2 high IL-10 − CD20 + CD38 + CD27 + IgA − IgD − B cell subset merges in patients with breast cancer after chemotherapy.
To evaluate the clinical significance of this B subset, we performed immunostaining in 224 paired clinical samples. Automated image analysis ( Figures 2 A and S2 A) revealed that tumor-infiltrating ICOSL + B cells significantly increased after chemotherapy ( Figures 2 B and 2C). By contrast, IL-10 + CD19 + cell counts dramatically decreased ( Figures 2 B and S2 B), corroborating scRNA-seq and flow cytometric analyses. Additionally, the ICOSL + B cell density in the residual tissues of patients with partial or complete remission was markedly higher than that of patients with disease progression or stable disease ( Figure 2 D). To exclude the possibility that resection sampling yields a different cell count compared to biopsy sampling in the same specimen, we evaluated a group of control treatment-naive samples. We observed a good concordance in counting ICOSL + B cells between biopsy samples and matched surgical samples (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.895, p < 0.001) ( Figures S2 C–S2E), indicating that the increase in ICOSL + B cells truly reflected the dynamic changes of the TME after chemotherapy.
Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) promote intratumoral B-cell-T-cell interactions and therapeutic efficacy ( Sautès-Fridman et al., 2019 46. Sautès-Fridman, C. ∙ Petitprez, F. ∙ Calderaro, J. ... Tertiary lymphoid structures in the era of cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :307-325 Crossref Scopus (910) PubMed Google Scholar ). More TLOs were found in breast cancers subjected to chemotherapy compared to treatment-naive specimens ( Figures 2 E and 2F), especially those with therapeutic response ( Figure S2 F). Interestingly, ICOSL + B cells accumulated in TLOs and had significantly closer contact with T cells compared to ICOSL − B cells ( Figures 2 G, 2H, and S2 G).
More importantly, we used X-tile statistical software to determine an optimal cutoff point (53.47%) by a minimal p value approach, and found that the abundance of tumor-infiltrating ICOSL + B cells was associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in all subgroups of patients receiving neoadjuvant-chemotherapy, except for the HR + Her2 − subtype ( Table S1 ; Figures 2 I and S2 H). Among them, the lowest hazard ratio was observed in the triple negative subtype ( Figures 2 I and S2 H). In the treatment-naive cohort ( Table S2 ) with much fewer tumor-infiltrating ICOSL + B cells, their abundance was associated with longer DFS in the subgroups of the triple negative subtype, grade 3, and clinical stage III ( Figure S2 I).
The multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the tumor size, lymph node status, and ER, the standard clinical factors identified previously ( Untch et al., 2018 58. Untch, M. ∙ von Minckwitz, G. ∙ Gerber, B. ... Survival Analysis After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Trastuzumab or Lapatinib in Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer in the GeparQuinto (G5) Study (GBG 44) J. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 36 :1308-1316 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed independent prognostic significance in DFS and OS, suggesting these cohorts matched the expected biology. Importantly, ICOSL + B cell abundance was also an independent prognostic factor after adjusting for other conventional variables ( Tables S3–S5 ). Moreover, the p values for interaction analysis between Trastuzumab treatment status and the ICOSL + B cell abundance was not statistically significant in Her2 + patients ( Figure S2 J), suggesting that ICOSL + B cell abundance was associated with better prognosis in Her2 + patients regardless of whether the regimens contained Trastuzumab or not.
Furthermore, using multiple published datasets, we confirmed the elevated expression of ICOSLG in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( Figure S2 K) and found that this elevation correlated with better prognosis ( Figure S2 L). Collectively, these data indicate that the ICOSL + B cell subset is closely associated with improved chemotherapy efficacy and patient prognosis.
To investigate whether animal models can recapitulate the impact of chemotherapy on B cell phenotypes in patients, we administrated doxorubicin to C57/BL6 mice bearing syngeneic E0771 cells and performed scRNA-seq on isolated tumor-infiltrating B cells. Consistent with patients, B cells with strong ICOSL and CR2 expression and low IL-10 expression dramatically increased in mice treated with chemotherapy ( Figures 3 A and 3B). To further validate these findings, we used multiple mouse models, including C57/BL6 mice injected with E0771 cells, BALB/C mice injected with syngeneic 4T1 cells, and MMTV-PyMT mice with spontaneous mammary tumors. Flow cytometry and immunostaining revealed that ICOSL and CR2 levels markedly increased in tumor-infiltrating B cells in mice treated with chemotherapy, whereas IL-10 expression was significantly inhibited ( Figures 3 C–3E and S3 A–S3C). By contrast, the percentage of total B cells in tumors did not significantly change ( Figure S3 D). Together, these findings indicate that the phenotype of B cells in breast cancer is switched after chemotherapy.
Consistent with previous reports ( Affara et al., 2014 1. Affara, N.I. ∙ Ruffell, B. ∙ Medler, T.R. ... B cells regulate macrophage phenotype and response to chemotherapy in squamous carcinomas Cancer Cell. 2014; 25 :809-821 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ), tumors grown in Jh −/− mice, which have no mature B cells, were significantly smaller than those in the wild-type littermates. Unexpectedly, tumors arising in the Jh −/− mice were much less sensitive to chemotherapy ( Figures 3 F and S3 E). Similar results were obtained when B cells were depleted by antibodies against CD19, CD20, CD22, and B220 in MMTV-PyMT or BALB/C mice during chemotherapy ( Figures 3 G and S3 F), suggesting that the TME exposed to chemotherapy can foster an anti-tumor B cell subset.
To investigate whether the different chemotherapy response is accompanied by altered T cell immunity, we assessed the tumor-infiltration of Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells associated with anti-tumor immunity, including granzyme-B-expressing CD8 + T cells, IFN-γ expressing CD4 + T cells, and T-bet + Th1 cells. MMTV-PyMT mice treated with antibodies to deplete B cells exhibited less Tregs and more effector T cells in tumors ( Figures 3 H and S3 G). By contrast, B cell depletion in mice treated with chemotherapy, in which tumor-infiltrating B cells were predominantly ICOSL + ( Figures 3 C–3E), had an opposite effect on the Teff/Treg ratio in tumors ( Figures 3 H and S3 G). Similar results were observed in the Jh −/− mice inoculated with E0771 cells ( Figures 3 I and S3 H).
To specifically explore the functions of ICOSL + B cells in vivo , we isolated tumor-infiltrating ICOSL + B cells from wild-type mice treated with chemotherapy by FACS and intravenously injected into Jh −/− mice. The adoptive transfer of ICOSL + B cells, rather than ICOSL − B cells, significantly improved chemotherapy efficacy ( Figure 3 J) and increased the Teff/Treg ratio in tumors ( Figure 3 K). Collectively, these data indicate that ICOSL + B cells generated in the TME exposed to chemotherapy are required for the optimal anti-tumor immune response.
Given that ICOSL was significantly elevated in tumor-infiltrating B cells after chemotherapy, we administrated neutralizing antibodies against ICOSL with or without chemotherapy in BALB/C mice bearing 4T1 grafts. ICOSL blockade significantly inhibited chemotherapy efficacy, although anti-ICOSL monotherapy had no appreciable effect on tumor growth ( Figure 4 A). The reduced responsiveness to chemotherapy was accompanied by decreased frequencies of granzyme-B- or perforin-expressing CD8 + T cells and Th1 cells, as well as increased Tregs in tumors ( Figures 4 B and S4 A). Despite the marked reduction in immune response and chemotherapy efficacy, tumor-infiltrating B cells in mice treated with anti-ICOSL were phenotypically comparable to mice treated by IgG with regard to the expression of CR2 and IL-10 ( Figures S4 B–S4D), suggesting that ICOSL is dispensable for inducing the phenotype of B cells after chemotherapy. Reduced chemosensitivity by ICOSL inhibition was not unique to this experimental setting, as when we implanted E0771 cells into syngeneic Icosl −/− mice, the tumors were less responsive to chemotherapy ( Figure 4 C). By comparison, the tumors grew similarly in mice treated with PBS, regardless of the host genotype ( Figure 4 C).
To investigate whether the compromised chemotherapy efficacy in Icosl −/− mice is mediated by B cells, B cells from wild-type mice were adoptively transferred into Icosl −/− mice. We observed that the reduced tumor response to chemotherapy was rescued by the transfer of wild-type B cells ( Figure 4 D). To specifically investigate the function of ICOSL in B cells, we crossed mice with loxP-flanked ICOSL alleles to CD19-Cre mice, developing mice that are homozygous Cd19-Icosl −/− ( Figure 4 E). The flow cytometric analysis confirmed that ICOSL induction in tumor-infiltrating B cells after chemotherapy was abolished in Cd19-Icosl Δ mice, whereas ICOSL expression in CD11c + cells isolated from the spleen was not affected ( Figures 4 F and S4 E). Again, the conditional knockout of ICOSL in B cells dramatically undermined the chemotherapy effects ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Furthermore, the absence of ICOSL + CD19 + cells was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of effector T cells and an increase in Treg abundancy in tumors of Cd19-Icosl Δ mice ( Figures 4 I and 4J). Together, these data indicate that ICOSL induced in tumor-infiltrating B cells after chemotherapy elicit an antitumor T cell immune response and improve chemotherapy efficacy.
CR2 recognizes complement C3 cleavage products bound to antigens and acts in conjunction with the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) to lower the activation threshold ( Carroll and Isenman, 2012 11. Carroll, M.C. ∙ Isenman, D.E. Regulation of humoral immunity by complement Immunity. 2012; 37 :199-207 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ) and overcome B cell anergy ( Lyubchenko et al., 2007 34. Lyubchenko, T. ∙ Dal Porto, J.M. ∙ Holers, V.M. ... Cutting edge: Complement (C3d)-linked antigens break B cell anergy J. Immunol. 2007; 179 :2695-2699 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that ICOSL + B cells exhibited elevated CR2 levels, we asked whether the complement pathway regulates the generation of ICOSL + B cells. Similar to radiotherapy ( Surace et al., 2015 56. Surace, L. ∙ Lysenko, V. ∙ Fontana, A.O. ... Complement is a central mediator of radiotherapy-induced tumor-specific immunity and clinical response Immunity. 2015; 42 :767-777 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), complement C3 fragments significantly increased in tumors of mice treated with chemotherapy ( Figures 5 A–5C, S5 A, and S5B). Complement C3 fragments located predominantly in the proximity of blood vessels 3 days after chemotherapy ( Figures 5 A and S5 A) and also in tumor cells after 24 days, especially the Tunel + cells ( Figures 5 B and S5 B).
To investigate the effect of complement activation, we administrated chemotherapy to C3 −/− mice inoculated with tumor cells. Consistent with B cell depletion, C3 knockout reduced tumor growth in treatment-naive states. By contrast, chemotherapy was less effective in C3 −/− mice ( Figure 5 D). More importantly, the abundance of ICOSL + B cells in tumors exposed to chemotherapy was abolished by C3 knockout ( Figures 5 E and S5 C).
To specifically elucidate the role of complement signals in B cells, we crossed mice having loxP-flanked CR2 alleles with CD19-Cre mice, thereby developing homozygous Cd19-Cr2 Δ mice ( Figures S5 D and S5E). The upregulation of ICOSL after chemotherapy was absent in CR2-deficient B cells ( Figure 5 F, S5 F, and S5G). As expected, the Cd19-Cr2 Δ mice had a marked decrease in effector T cells and an increase of Tregs in tumors after chemotherapy ( Figures 5 G, 5H, S5 H, and S5I). Moreover, the tumor grew more slowly in the Cd19-Cr2 Δ mice treated with chemotherapy, rather than the ones treated with PBS ( Figure 5 I). Collectively, these results indicate that complement activation in the TME exposed to chemotherapy is responsible for inducing ICOSL + B cells via CR2 in mice.
To investigate whether chemotherapy-induced complement activation in mice is similar in humans, we cultured human tumor cells pretreated with chemotherapy in the presence of human serum. Chemotherapy induced bioactive complement fragment production in the supernatant ( Figure S6 A) and on the surface of tumor cells which exhibited features of cell death ( Galluzzi et al., 2009 18. Galluzzi, L. ∙ Aaronson, S.A. ∙ Abrams, J. ... Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring cell death in higher eukaryotes Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16 :1093-1107 Crossref Scopus (572) PubMed Google Scholar ), including caspase activation, PARP proteolytic processing ( Figure 6 A), and PI (propidium iodide) staining ( Figures 6 B and S6 B). Heat inactivation of the serum ( Figures 6 A, 6B, and S6 B) or neutralization of phosphatidylserine (PS) ( Figures S6 A and S6D), a phospholipid that is exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis and activates the complement system via the alternative pathway ( Wang et al., 1993 61. Wang, R.H. ∙ Phillips, Jr., G. ∙ Medof, M.E. ... Activation of the alternative complement pathway by exposure of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine on erythrocytes from sickle cell disease patients J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92 :1326-1335 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ), markedly reduced the complement cleavage despite cell death and remained unchanged ( Figures 6 A, 6B, S6 B, and S6C). Consistently, the complement cleavage was significantly attenuated by caspase inhibitors ( Figures S6 E and S6F). Collectively, these data indicate that tumor cell death induced by chemotherapy activates the complement system, at least partially, through PS.
To address whether the complement-mediated B cell phenotype switch in mice is also shared by humans, we co-cultured human B cells with MDA-MB-231 cells with or without previous exposure to chemotherapy and human serum. The IL-10 levels in B cells significantly increased after being co-cultured with treatment-naive tumor cells ( Figures 6 C and S6 G), which were absent in B cells co-cultured with tumor cells treated with chemotherapy. Moreover, ICOSL and CR2 levels were significantly higher in B cells co-cultured with chemotherapy-exposed tumor cells compared to those cultured alone ( Figures 6 C and S6 G). To investigate the effect of these B cells on anti-tumor immunity, we generated tumor-specific CD8 + /CD4 + T cells by incubating CD8 + /CD4 + T cells with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysates ( Su et al., 2017, 2018b 53. Su, S. ∙ Liao, J. ∙ Liu, J. ... Blocking the recruitment of naive CD4 + T cells reverses immunosuppression in breast cancer Cell Res. 2017; 27 :461-482 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Su, S. ∙ Zhao, J. ∙ Xing, Y. ... Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Overcomes ADCP-Induced Immunosuppression by Macrophages Cell. 2018; 175 :442-457.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). B cells co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells increased the percentage of Tregs, reduced the proportion of effector CD4 + T cells, and inhibited tumoricidal effects of CD8 + T cells ( Figures 6 D, 6E, and S6 H). By comparison, B cells co-cultured with chemotherapy-treated tumor cells significantly increased the CD4 + Teff/Treg ratio and enhanced the CD8 + T-cell-mediated immune response ( Figures 6 D, 6E, and S6H), which was abrogated by the ICOSL blockade ( Figure S6 I). To investigate whether these effects are complement dependent, we heated the serum to inactivate the complement. The phenotype and function of the B cells co-cultured with chemotherapy-treated tumor cells were reinstated to those co-cultured with treatment-naive tumor cells when the human serum was replaced with the heat-inactivated serum ( Figures 6 C–6E, S6 G, and S6H). Similar effects were observed by using neutralizing antibodies to CR2 ( Figures S6 J and S6K), collectively supporting an indispensable role of the complement in regulating the characteristics of B cells during chemotherapy.
To investigate the origin of this B cell subset, we sorted naive, memory, non-switched memory, and double-negative B cells ( Figure 6 F) and co-cultured them with chemotherapy-exposed tumor cells. The co-culture significantly increased ICOSL + B cells in naive B cells as well as memory B cells, albeit to a much lesser extent ( Figures 6 G and S6 L). Next, we further isolated transitional and mature-naive B cells from naive B cells ( Figure 6 H). Although transitional B cells could give rise to ICOSL + B cells, mature-naive B cells showed much stronger potency ( Figures 6 I and S6 M). More importantly, the transfusion of mature-naive B cells from wild-type mice restored more ICOSL + B cells in the tumors of Jh −/− mice treated with chemotherapy compared to the B cell pool depleted of mature-naive B cells ( Figures 6 J and S6 N). Together, these data suggested that mature-naive B cells are important progenitors of ICOSL + B cells in chemotherapy-exposed tumors.
Clinically, we found that C3 cleavage products significantly increased in the human tumors after chemotherapy ( Figures 6 K, 6L, and S6 O). More importantly, the complement activation in tumors was closely correlated with the number of infiltrating ICOSL + B cells (R 2 = 0.322, p < 0.001) ( Figures 6 K and 6M). Together, these data indicated that chemotherapy-induced tumor cell death activates the complement which enhances anti-tumor immunity and chemotherapy efficacy by generating an ICOSL + B cell subset.
Interestingly, a fraction of the 11 breast cancer cell lines used failed to induce ICOSL + B cells regardless of chemotherapy ( Figure 7 A). The aberrant expression of complement regulatory proteins in tumor cells has been reported ( Reis et al., 2018 43. Reis, E.S. ∙ Mastellos, D.C. ∙ Ricklin, D. ... Complement in cancer: untangling an intricate relationship Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :5-18 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we analyzed the expression profile of complement regulatory proteins in different breast cancer cell lines from the online transcriptomic data and found that levels of CD55, a complement inhibitory protein bound to the cell membrane or released into the microenvironment, were significantly lower in tumor cells that could induce ICOSL + B cells after chemotherapy than in those that could not ( Figure S7 A). The expression pattern was confirmed at the protein level ( Figure 7 B).
To investigate the role of CD55 in chemosensitivity and tumor immunity in vivo , we injected E0771 cells with or without CD55 overexpression ( Figure S7 B) in mice. CD55 overexpression significantly increased tumor size in mice treated with chemotherapy, but not in those treated with PBS ( Figure 7 C). Additionally, chemotherapy increased tumor-infiltrating ICOSL + B cells and effector T cells in mice bearing parental E0771 cells, but not in those bearing cells with CD55 overexpression. By contrast, the abundancy of Tregs was more pronounced in CD55-overexpressed tumors treated with chemotherapy ( Figure 7 D). As expected, the complement cleavage in tumors induced by chemotherapy was dramatically reduced after CD55 overexpression ( Figure S7 C). Moreover, the effect of CD55 overexpression on chemosensitivity ( Figure S7 D) and T cell complexity ( Figure S7 E) was completely abrogated in C3 −/− mice, suggesting that it is complement dependent. Together, our results indicate that the aberrant CD55 expression in tumor cells undermines chemotherapy efficacy by inhibiting complement-dependent ICOSL + B cell induction.
B cell depletion enhances chemosensitivity in some mouse tumor models, including transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP-C2) model ( Shalapour et al., 2015 49. Shalapour, S. ∙ Font-Burgada, J. ∙ Di Caro, G. ... Immunosuppressive plasma cells impede T-cell-dependent immunogenic chemotherapy Nature. 2015; 521 :94-98 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ). TRAMP-C2 tumor cells expressed higher levels of CD55 compared to E0771 cells ( Figure S7 F). Few ICOSL + B cells were observed in TRAMP-C2 tumors before or after chemotherapy. However, CD55 knockout significantly increased tumor-infiltrating ICOSL + B cells in mice treated with chemotherapy ( Figure 7 E). Moreover, the increase of ICOSL + B cells in tumors by CD55 silencing was accompanied by enhancement of the Teff/Treg ratio ( Figure 7 F) and chemotherapy efficacy ( Figure 7 G). Together, these data suggest that CD55 expression in tumor cells determines the role of B cells in anti-tumor immunity and chemotherapy efficacy.
To investigate the clinical significance of CD55, we analyzed CD55 levels in tumors of patients with breast cancer. CD55 expression was predominantly observed in tumor cells ( Figure 7 H). More importantly, CD55 levels in pre-treatment biopsies were negatively correlated with complement cleavage and ICOSL + B cell infiltration in paired post-treatment samples ( Figures 7 H, 7I, and S7 G). Moreover, tumoral CD55 expression was significantly higher in patients resistant to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy than sensitive ones ( Figure 7 J) and associated with worse clinical outcomes ( Figures 7 K and S7 H) validated by multiple independent cohorts ( Figures S7 I and S7J). Collectively, these data indicate that CD55 in tumors induces chemoresistance by impeding the induction of ICOSL + B cells.

Section: Discussion

Previous use of rituximab to deplete B cells demonstrated no real clinical benefits for patients with solid tumor ( Gunderson and Coussens, 2013 20. Gunderson, A.J. ∙ Coussens, L.M. B cells and their mediators as targets for therapy in solid tumors Exp. Cell Res. 2013; 319 :1644-1649 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). This can be explained by the finding that both pro- and anti-tumoral B cells exist in the TME ( Affara et al., 2014; Ammirante et al., 2010; Hennequin et al., 2015; Shalapour et al., 2015 1.

Ammirante, M. ∙ Luo, J.L. ∙ Grivennikov, S. ... B-cell-derived lymphotoxin promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer Nature. 2010; 464 :302-305 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Hennequin, A. ∙ Derangère, V. ∙ Boidot, R. ... Tumor infiltration by Tbet+ effector T cells and CD20+ B cells is associated with survival in gastric cancer patients OncoImmunology. 2015; 5 :e1054598 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar 49.

Immunosuppressive plasma cells impede T-cell-dependent immunogenic chemotherapy Nature. 2015; 521 :94-98 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, there is a pressing need to dissect the mechanisms that determine B cell heterogeneity in tumors. Here, we provide insights into some key issues: (1) a B cell subset emerging after chemotherapy elicits anti-tumor T cell immunity and improves therapeutic response by ICOSL, (2) complement-CR2 signals initiated by immunogenic cell death regulate this B cell subset, and (3) the expression of CD55 in tumors determines the opposite effects of B cells on chemotherapy in various malignancies.
Previous studies have showed that ICOSL is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells ( Aicher et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2016a 2. Aicher, A. ∙ Hayden-Ledbetter, M. ∙ Brady, W.A. ... Characterization of human inducible costimulator ligand expression and function J. Immunol. 2000; 164 :4689-4696 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Zhang, C. ∙ Xin, H. ∙ Zhang, W. ... CD5 Binds to Interleukin-6 and Induces a Feed-Forward Loop with the Transcription Factor STAT3 in B Cells to Promote Cancer Immunity. 2016; 44 :913-923 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, we found that a large fraction of B cells was ICOSL + after chemotherapy, and this B cell subset was associated with improved prognosis in breast cancer patients, especially those with the triple negative subtype. This finding is clinically important because triple negative breast cancers are the most sensitive and at need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( von Minckwitz et al., 2013 60. von Minckwitz, G. ∙ Blohmer, J.U. ∙ Costa, S.D. ... Response-guided neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer J. Clin. Oncol. 2013; 31 :3623-3630 Crossref Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ) and immunotherapy ( Schmid et al., 2018 48. Schmid, P. ∙ Adams, S. ∙ Rugo, H.S. ..., IMpassion130 Trial Investigators Atezolizumab and Nab-Paclitaxel in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 379 :2108-2121 Crossref Scopus (2988) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this study has limitations of a small retrospective investigation. The hazard ratios in the sub-stratified analysis may be confounded by the group size. Therefore, our findings should be validated in the future hypothesis-testing clinical trial.
Using B-cell-specific ICOSL knockout mice, we unambiguously demonstrated that ICOSL in B cells boosts chemosensitivity by enhancing tumor-specific CD8 + T cells and the Th1/Treg ratio. Consistently, ICOS enhances the generation of effector cells in tumors ( Fan et al., 2014; Metzger et al., 2016 15. Fan, X. ∙ Quezada, S.A. ∙ Sepulveda, M.A. ... Engagement of the ICOS pathway markedly enhances efficacy of CTLA-4 blockade in cancer immunotherapy J. Exp. Med. 2014; 211 :715-725 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Metzger, T.C. ∙ Long, H. ∙ Potluri, S. ... ICOS Promotes the Function of CD4+ Effector T Cells during Anti-OX40-Mediated Tumor Rejection Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :3684-3689 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, ICOS overexpression in tumor-infiltrating T cells is a distinctive feature of anti-tumor responses observed in patients receiving ipilimumab ( Wei et al., 2017 63. Wei, S.C. ∙ Levine, J.H. ∙ Cogdill, A.P. ... Distinct Cellular Mechanisms Underlie Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2017; 170 :1120-1133.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (921) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, we expand the current model by proposing that ICOSL in multiple types of immune cells plays a crucial role in anti-tumor immunity induced by both conventional therapy and immunotherapy.
CR2, which colligates with BCR ( Carroll and Isenman, 2012 11. Carroll, M.C. ∙ Isenman, D.E. Regulation of humoral immunity by complement Immunity. 2012; 37 :199-207 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ), enhances B cell activation by reducing the activation threshold ( Ricklin et al., 2010 44. Ricklin, D. ∙ Hajishengallis, G. ∙ Yang, K. ... Complement: a key system for immune surveillance and homeostasis Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11 :785-797 Crossref Scopus (2784) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the importance of complement in B cell immunity being appreciated for more than 40 years ( Pepys, 1972 41. Pepys, M.B. Role of complement in induction of the allergic response Nat. New Biol. 1972; 237 :157-159 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ), its role in tumor-associated B cells remains largely unknown. CR2 is expressed not only on B cells, but also on follicular dendritic cells and a subset of T cells ( Erdei et al., 2016 14. Erdei, A. ∙ Sándor, N. ∙ Mácsik-Valent, B. ... The versatile functions of complement C3-derived ligands Immunol. Rev. 2016; 274 :127-140 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, CR2 can regulate B cell functions at two levels ( Carroll and Isenman, 2012 11. Carroll, M.C. ∙ Isenman, D.E. Regulation of humoral immunity by complement Immunity. 2012; 37 :199-207 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ): (1) CR2 on B cells provides direct signals, and (2) FDCs trap and deliver C3-opsonized antigens to B cells via CR2 during affinity maturation ( Heesters et al., 2014 23. Heesters, B.A. ∙ Myers, R.C. ∙ Carroll, M.C. Follicular dendritic cells: dynamic antigen libraries Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :495-504 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). By constructing B-cell-specific CR2 knockout mice, we provided clear evidence that co-stimulatory signals provided by complement dictate the fate decision of tumor-associated B cells. The importance of co-stimulation in T-cell-mediated immunity is exploited by cancers as immune evasion. Interestingly, our data suggest that tumors induce immunosuppressive B cells rather than immunoactivative ones because they do not elicit B cell costimulatory signals, which is reminiscent of T cell suppression. Consistently, lack of complement co-stimulation can lead to B cell anergy ( Lyubchenko et al., 2007 34. Lyubchenko, T. ∙ Dal Porto, J.M. ∙ Holers, V.M. ... Cutting edge: Complement (C3d)-linked antigens break B cell anergy J. Immunol. 2007; 179 :2695-2699 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the previously uncharacterized role of B cell costimulatory signals in tumors described here provides new evidence for the larger concept that the lack of co-stimulatory signals for adaptive immune cell activation facilitates cancer cells to evade immune surveillance.
Cells can die in many ways; some are immunogenic ( Galluzzi et al., 2017; Kroemer et al., 2013; Zitvogel et al., 2010 19. Galluzzi, L. ∙ Buqué, A. ∙ Kepp, O. ... Immunogenic cell death in cancer and infectious disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :97-111 Crossref Scopus (2034) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Kroemer, G. ∙ Galluzzi, L. ∙ Kepp, O. ...

Decoding cell death signals in inflammation and immunity Cell. 2010; 140 :798-804 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (470) PubMed Google Scholar ). The complement can be activated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) exposed on dead tumor cells ( Berraondo et al., 2016; Reis et al., 2018 7. Berraondo, P. ∙ Minute, L. ∙ Ajona, D. ...

PTX3 is an extrinsic oncosuppressor regulating complement-dependent inflammation in cancer Cell. 2015; 160 :700-714 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar 36.

However, emerging evidence shows that the complement can also elicit anti-tumor immunity when it acts in concert with certain tumor treatments, such as radiotherapy and monoclonal antibodies ( Hajishengallis et al., 2017; Surace et al., 2015; Taylor and Lindorfer, 2016 21. Hajishengallis, G. ∙ Reis, E.S. ∙ Mastellos, D.C. ... Novel mechanisms and functions of complement Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :1288-1298 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar 56.

Complement is a central mediator of radiotherapy-induced tumor-specific immunity and clinical response Immunity. 2015; 42 :767-777 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Taylor, R.P. ∙ Lindorfer, M.A. Cytotoxic mechanisms of immunotherapy: Harnessing complement in the action of anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies Semin. Immunol. 2016; 28 :309-316 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results supplement these studies by showing that cell-death-associated PS exposure initiates anti-tumor adaptive immunity, which consists of both B and T cells, via the critical innate immune component complement. Together, we and others demonstrate that the complement can be a potent adjuvant to trigger immune response during immunogenic cell death in multiple cancer therapies.
B cell depletion enhances chemosensitivity in some mouse tumor models, such as prostate cancer ( Shalapour et al., 2015 49. Shalapour, S. ∙ Font-Burgada, J. ∙ Di Caro, G. ... Immunosuppressive plasma cells impede T-cell-dependent immunogenic chemotherapy Nature. 2015; 521 :94-98 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, we found that B cell depletion reduced chemotherapeutic effects in three different breast cancer mouse models. This discrepancy is highly clinically relevant, as B cell density is correlated to both better (Hennequin et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2015 67. Zhu, W. ∙ Germain, C. ∙ Liu, Z. ... A high density of tertiary lymphoid structure B cells in lung tumors is associated with increased CD4 + T cell receptor repertoire clonality OncoImmunology. 2015; 4 :e1051922 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and worse ( Affara et al., 2014 1. Affara, N.I. ∙ Ruffell, B. ∙ Medler, T.R. ... B cells regulate macrophage phenotype and response to chemotherapy in squamous carcinomas Cancer Cell. 2014; 25 :809-821 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ) prognosis in patients with different malignancies. CD55 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that accelerates C3 convertases decay and inhibits C3b deposition ( Reis et al., 2018; Spendlove et al., 2006 43. Reis, E.S. ∙ Mastellos, D.C. ∙ Ricklin, D. ... Complement in cancer: untangling an intricate relationship Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :5-18 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Spendlove, I. ∙ Ramage, J.M. ∙ Bradley, R. ... Complement decay accelerating factor (DAF)/CD55 in cancer Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2006; 55 :987-995 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we identified that the heterogeneous expression of CD55 in tumor cells determines the conflict effects of B cells on chemotherapy, suggesting that the manipulation of complement signals can be used to shape the B-cell-mediated immune response in tumors.
In summary, this study reveals that oncological therapy profoundly re-shapes the plasticity of B cells in tumors and uncovers a new role of complement in B-cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. Equally importantly, we propose CD55 as an attractive therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of immunogenic chemotherapy.

Paraffin-embedded tumor samples were obtained from 368 female patients with invasive breast carcinoma (stage I-III) who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University (Guangzhou, China) from 2010 to 2015. Among them, biopsy samples before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were available for 224 patients. Fresh tumor samples were obtained from 79 female patients with invasive breast carcinoma (stage I-III) who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital from 2017 to 2019. Paired biopsy samples and surgically resected samples were collected from the same patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Blood samples were obtained from 86 female patients before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and one month after the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
The neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens were as follows: doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 every three weeks for four cycles, followed by paclitaxel (80 mg/m 2 ) for 12 weeks; or docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 every three weeks for four to six cycles. Her2-positive patients were treated with concomitant Trastuzumab (initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg and subsequent doses of 2 mg/kg/wk weekly).
Therapeutic effects were evaluated according to the standard of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as no any residual invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in any excised breast or lymph node tissue after neoadjuvant chemotherapy detected by microscopy ( Fayanju et al., 2018; von Minckwitz et al., 2013 16. Fayanju, O.M. ∙ Ren, Y. ∙ Thomas, S.M. ... The Clinical Significance of Breast-only and Node-only Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT): A Review of 20,000 Breast Cancer Patients in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) Ann. Surg. 2018; 268 :591-601 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar 60. von Minckwitz, G. ∙ Blohmer, J.U. ∙ Costa, S.D. ... Response-guided neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer J. Clin. Oncol. 2013; 31 :3623-3630 Crossref Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ); breast-only or node-only pCR was defined as the absence of any residual invasive carcinoma or DCIS limited to the breast or axilla detected by microscopy; partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% reduction in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions detected by clinical examination and imaging studies; progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions detected by clinical examination and imaging studies; and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD. Breast- and node-only pCR were only determined for patients who were clinically node-positive at diagnosis. Clinical node stage was defined according to imaging studies, clinical examination demonstrating characteristics highly suspicious for malignancy, and/or pathologic diagnosis obtained via needle biopsy. pCR, breast/node-only pCR and PR were classified as treatment sensitive, while SD and PD were classified as treatment resistant.
The criteria to determine menopause include any of the following: 1) Prior bilateral oophorectomy; 2) Age ≥ 60 y; 3) Age < 60 y and amenorrheic for 12 or more months in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol in the postmenopausal range; 4) If taking tamoxifen or toremifene, and age < 60 y, then FSH and plasma estradiol level in postmenopausal ranges.
Additionally, another cohort consisting of paraffin-embedded samples from 683 female patients with chemotherapy-naive invasive breast carcinoma from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital from 2010 to 2015 was obtained for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. To experimentally excluded the potential spatial sampling biases, a group of paired biopsy samples and surgically resected samples from 53 female patients who received needle core biopsy followed by surgery (without neoadjuvant chemotherapy) from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital from 2015 to 2019 were selected. The tissue blocks with only or predominantly non-tumor tissues or in situ carcinoma tissues were excluded. To investigate whether the prognostic value of ICOSL + B cells in Her2 + patients is restricted to those receiving Trastuzumab, we used another cohort of Her2 + female patients (n = 103) who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy without Trastuzumab from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital from 2006 to 2017. All samples were collected from patients who gave informed consent, and all related procedures were performed with the approval of the internal review and ethics boards of the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital.

C57/BL6 and BALB/C mice were purchased from Weitonglihua Experimental Animal Technical Company (Beijing, China). All mice were bred in the SPF animal facility of the Laboratory Animal Resource Center of Sun Yat-sen University in individually ventilated cages.
Cr2 flox/flox and Icosl flox/flox mice were constructed in Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc (Shanghai, China) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Progeny were screened by PCR for germline transmission of the targeted alleles. Cr2 flox/flox and Icosl flox/flox mice were crossed with Cd19 -Cre mice respectively to generate mice with Cr2 or Icosl conditional knock out in B cells ( Cd19-Cr2 Δ and Cd19-Icosl Δ ). Genotyping was performed by PCR on tail DNA with specific primers (sequences listed in KEY RESOURCES TABLE). The PCR products were further confirmed by sequencing. Conditional deletion of Cr2 and Icosl in Cd19-Cr2 Δ and Cd19-Icosl Δ mice was examined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence using B cells isolated from the spleens and tumors. Wild-type C57/BL6 and BALB/C mice as well as genetic modified mice with the C57/BL6 background at the age of six weeks, and female MMTV-PyMT mice at the age of 12-14 weeks were used. Female mice were used in the experiments using E0771 and 4T1 cells, whereas male mice were used in the experiments using TRAMP-C2 cells. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Review Boards and Animal Care and Use Committees of Sun Yat-Sen University.
Primary tumor-infiltrating immune cells were isolated from human or mouse tumor samples using flow cytometric cell sorting as we previously described ( Huang et al., 2018; Su et al., 2018a 26. Huang, D. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... NKILA lncRNA promotes tumor immune evasion by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death Nat.

Briefly, to isolate B cells from human tumors, tissues were exhaustively perfused with PBS to prevent the contamination of peripheral blood cells, minced into small (1-2 mm diameter) pieces, and digested with 5% FBS DMEM containing 2 mg/mL collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical), 2 mg/mL collagenase III (Worthington Biochemical) and 2 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37°C for 2 h. The cells were sequentially filtered through 100 and 70 μm cell strainers. Pacific Blue anti-human CD45 (Cat# 304022, Biolegend) and PE anti-human CD19 (Cat# 392506, Biolegend) were used to identify B cells. To exclude dead cells, the cells were stained with 1 mM calcein AM (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 0.33 mM TO-PRO-3 iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific) immediately prior to sorting. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using 488 nm (calcein AM, 530/30 filter), 640 nm (TO-PRO-3, 670/14 filter), 405 nm (Pacific blue, 450/50 filter) and 561 nm (PE, 586/15 filter) lasers. Standard forward scatter height versus area criteria were used to discard doublets and capture singlets. Viable cells were identified as calcein high and TO-PRO low , and CD45 + CD19 + gates were used to specifically sort B cells. To isolate tumor-infiltrating B cells from mice, tumor tissues were cut into small (1-2 mm) pieces and incubated in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mg/mL collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical), 2 mg/mL collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical) and 100 μg/mL DNase I (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C under constant shaking. During digestion, the tissue pieces in solution was vortexed every 15 min. The cell suspensions were filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer, washed twice by PBS and were sorted by FACS using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Before cell sorting, isolated cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1% FBS and incubated with antibody against FITC-CD45 (Cat# 103108, Biolegend) and APC-CD19 (Cat# 115512, Biolegend) for 30 min at 4°C. To exclude dead cells, the cells were stained for Live/Dead Fixable Viability Dye (FVD-eFluor780, Cat# 65-0865-18, eBioscience) in PBS for 30 min at 4°C. The purity of the sorted populations was verified by flow cytometry on a Beckman CytoFLEX flow cytometer (98% pure). The viability and number of purified B cells were assessed using trypan blue (ThermoFisher Scientific) (at least 90% live cells). The harvested cells were either immediately used for further experiments or cryopreserved in the presence of DMSO at –80°C or in liquid nitrogen prior to library preparation.
Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human serum were isolated from the peripheral blood or buffy coat of patients and healthy donors from the Guangzhou Blood Center as we previously described ( Chen et al., 2019; Su et al., 2014; Su et al., 2018b 12.

Briefly, primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Cat# LTS1077, TBDscience) by density gradient centrifugation (37°C, 450 × g, 20 min, Beckman). Primary human B cells were purified by a B Cell Isolation Kit II (Cat# 130-091-151, Miltenyi Biotec). In some experiments, B cells were incubated with APC anti-human CD19 (Cat# 392504, Biolegend), Alexa Fluor® 700 anti-human IgD (Cat# 348229, Biolegend), FITC anti-human CD27 (Cat#356404, Biolegend), PE/Cy7 anti-human CD38 (Cat# 303516, Biolegend) and PerCP anti-human CD24 (Cat#311114, Biolegend) for 30 min at 4°C and sorted by a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). CD8 + T cells and naive CD4 + T cells were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting using direct CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kit (Cat# 130-096-495, Miltenyi Biotec) and naive CD4 + T Cells Isolation Kit II (Cat# 130-094-131, Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions respectively. To obtain human serum, the coagulated peripheral blood from healthy donors was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Then the serum which located on top of the specimen was carefully transferred into a clean tube and stored at −80°C. The blood samples were negative for antibodies against hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV and syphilis. All related procedures were performed with the approval of the Internal Review and Ethics Boards of the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital.
Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, BT474, BT549, HCC1937, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468, AU565, SK-BR-3, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 and mouse prostate cancer cell line TRAMP-C2 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Mouse breast cancer cell line E0771 was obtained from CH3 Biosystems. All the cells were grown according to standard protocols.
Primary tumor-infiltrating B Cells were isolated from human breast cancer tissues as we previously described with slight modifications ( Su et al., 2018a; Su et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019 53.

Briefly, human tumor tissues were exhaustively perfused with PBS to prevent the contamination of peripheral blood cells, minced into small (1-2 mm diameter) pieces with autoclaved surgical instruments, and digested with 5% FBS DMEM containing 2 mg/mL collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical), 2 mg/mL collagenase III (Worthington Biochemical) and 2 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37°C for 2 h under constant shaking. During digestion, the tissue pieces in solution were vortexed every 15 min. The cell suspensions were sequentially filtered through 100 and 70 μm cell strainers and washed twice with PBS. Pacific Blue anti-human CD45 (Cat# 304022, Biolegend) and PE anti-human CD19 (Cat# 392506, Biolegend) were used to identify B cells. To exclude dead cells, the cells were stained with 1 mM calcein AM (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 0.33 mM TO-PRO-3 iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific) immediately prior to sorting ( Puram et al., 2017 42. Puram, S.V. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Parikh, A.S. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Primary and Metastatic Tumor Ecosystems in Head and Neck Cancer Cell. 2017; 171 :1611-1624.e24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1478) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using 488 nm (calcein AM, 530/30 filter), 640 nm (TO-PRO-3, 670/14 filter), 405 nm (Pacific blue, 450/50 filter) and 561 nm (PE, 586/15 filter) lasers. Standard forward scatter height versus area criteria were used to discard doublets and capture singlets. Viable cells were identified as calcein high and TO-PRO low , and CD45 + CD19 + gates were used to specifically sort B cells. Viability was confirmed to be > 90% in all samples using trypan blue (ThermoFisher Scientific) exclusion.
CD45 + CD19 + cells from tumors were sorted into Dulbecco’s PBS + 0.04% BSA as aforementioned and retained on ice. Sorted cells were then counted and assessed for viability with Trypan blue using a Countess II automated counter (ThermoFisher Scientific). The cells were then resuspended at 1 × 10 5 –2 × 10 5 cells/mL with a final viability of > 90% as determined using the Countess. Single cells were encapsulated into emulsion droplets using Chromium Controller (10 × GENOMICS). ScRNA-seq libraries were constructed using Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3 (10 × GENOMICS) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Reverse transcription and library preparation were performed on a Veriti Thermal Cycler with 96-Deep Well Reaction Module (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amplified cDNA was purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter) and sheared to 250-400 bp. Qualification was performed using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system.
ScRNA-Seq data was processed using 10 × Genomics CellRanger (v3.0.2) pipeline. The resulting fastq files were passed to CellRanger’s count, which aligned all reads against GRCh38 genomes and mm10 genomes using the STAR aligner. The data from libraries were pooled by running through CellRanger aggr to obtain unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) matrices ( Macosko et al., 2015 35. Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Basu, A. ∙ Satija, R. ... Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets Cell. 2015; 161 :1202-1214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4634) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both mkfastq and count were run with default parameters.
For each sample, the gene - barcode matrix was passed through the R (v3.5.3) software package Seurat (v2.2.1) ( Satija et al., 2015 45. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (3233) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( https://satijalab.org/seurat ) for all downstream analyses. To remove doublets and poor-quality cells, cells were excluded from subsequent analysis if they were outliers in terms of number of the genes, UMIs, and the percentage of mitochondrial genes using Seurat. Consequently, 2,497 human single cells (998 from pre-treatment samples and 1,499 from post-treatment samples of four patients) and 7528 mouse single cells (2420 from two PBS-treated mice and 5108 from two doxorubicin-treated mice) were used for the following analysis. The cells were clustered using FindClusters in Seurat. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and modularity heatmap were created for graph-based cluster identification and subsequent dimensionality reduction. Marker genes for the individual clusters were identified using Seurat’s FindAllMarkers and only significantly upregulated markers (minimum log.FC ≥ 0 and FDR ≤ 1 × 10 −75 ) were represented.
Mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood (PBMCs) of patients or healthy donors were isolated as we previously described ( Chen et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018 12. Chen, F. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... Extracellular vesicle-packaged HIF-1α-stabilizing lncRNA from tumour-associated macrophages regulates aerobic glycolysis of breast cancer cells Nat.

NKILA lncRNA promotes tumor immune evasion by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1112-1125 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). To isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the buffy coat or peripheral blood sample was diluted with 2-4 × the volume of PBS. Then, 35 mL of diluted sample was gently layered over 15 mL of Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Cat# LTS1077, TBDscience) and centrifuged with the brake off (37°C, 450 × g, 20 min, Beckman). The mononuclear cell layer was carefully transferred to a clean 50 mL conical tube and washed thoroughly for four times with PBS to reduce platelet contamination. Primary human B cells were purified by a B Cell Isolation Kit II (Cat# 130-091-151, Miltenyi Biotec). In some experiments, B cells were incubated with APC anti-human CD19 (Cat# 392504, Biolegend), Alexa Fluor® 700 anti-human IgD (Cat# 348229, Biolegend), FITC anti-human CD27 (Cat#356404, Biolegend), PE/Cy7 anti-human CD38 (Cat# 303516, Biolegend) and PerCP anti-human CD24 (Cat#311114, Biolegend) for 30 min at 4°C and sorted by a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Suspended cells were stained for Live/Dead Fixable Viability Dye (FVD-eFluor780, Cat# 65-0865-18, eBioscience) in PBS for 30 min at 4°C to distinguished live and dead cells. To block non-specific binding, mouse and human cells were incubated with FcR blocking reagent for mice (Cat# 130-092-575, Miltenyi Biotec) and humans (Cat# 130-059-901, Miltenyi Biotec) respectively. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were re-stimulated with a cell stimulation cocktail (Cat# 00-4970-03, eBioscience; containing PMA and ionomycin) in the presence of a protein transport inhibitor cocktail containing Brefeldin A and Monensin (Cat# 00-4980-03, eBioscience) ( Shalapour et al., 2017 50. Shalapour, S. ∙ Lin, X.J. ∙ Bastian, I.N. ... Inflammation-induced IgA+ cells dismantle anti-liver cancer immunity Nature. 2017; 551 :340-345 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were stained for fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies in PBS with 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA or cell staining buffer (Cat# 00-4222-57, eBioscience or Cat# 420201, Biolegend). The monoclonal antibodies are as follows: human CD45 (Cat# 304022, 304006, Biolegend), human CD19 (Cat# 392504, 392506, 302224, Biolegend), human ICOSL (Cat# 309404, 309408, Biolegend), human IL-10 (Cat# 53-7108-42, eBioscience), human CR2 (Cat# 354912, Biolegend), human CD20 (Cat# 302310, Biolegend), human CD38 (Cat# 303516, Biolegend), human CD27 (Cat# 356432, Biolegend), human IgA (Cat#333510, Biolegend), human IgD (Cat# 348229, Biolegend), human IgG (Cat# 409306, Biolegend), human CD24 (Cat#311114, Biolegend), mouse CD45 (Cat# 103110, 103108, Biolegend), mouse CD19 (Cat# 115512, Biolegend), mouse ICOSL (Cat# 107405, Biolegend), mouse CD21/CD35 (CR2/CR1) (Cat# 123422, Biolegend), mouse IL-10 (Cat# 505006, Biolegend), mouse CD8a (Cat# 100711, Biolegend), mouse CD4 (Cat# 100412, Biolegend), human/mouse Granzyme B (Cat# 515403, Biolegend), mouse Perforin (Cat# 154306, Biolegend), mouse IFN-γ (Cat# 505806, Biolegend), T-bet (Cat# 644812, 644810, Biolegend), mouse/rat/human FOXP3 (Cat# 320008, 320014, 320012, Biolegend), mouse CD11c (Cat# 117310, Biolegend), mouse IgD (Cat# 405704, Biolegend), mouse IgM (Cat# 406508, Biolegend), human CD8 (Cat# 344722, Biolegend), human CD4 (Cat# 357408, Biolegend) and human C3b/iC3b (Cat#846108, Biolegend). Intracellular cytokine staining was performed using an Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilization kit (Cat# 88-8824, eBioscience), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Intranuclear transcription factor staining was performed using a True-Nuclear Transcription Factor Buffer Set (Cat# 424401, Biolegend). For some experiments, Propidium Iodide (Cat# 00-6990-50, eBioscience) was used to detect the death of tumor cells. The samples were analyzed by the Beckman CytoFLEX Flow cytometer. Data were analyzed by FlowJo software.
For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded samples were cut into 4 μm consecutive sections and deparaffinized antigens were retrieved via a pressure cooker for 3 min in EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). Specimens were incubated with mouse anti-human C3/C3b (Cat# ab11871, Abcam; 1:100) or rabbit anti–human CD55 (Cat# NBP1-85466, Novus Biologicals; 1:50) at 4°C overnight, washed with PBS for three times, and stained with an anti-mouse/rabbit IHC Secondary Antibody Kit (Cat# GK500705, GTVision), following the manufacturer’s instructions. For immunofluorescence analysis, the tissue sections were incubated with mouse anti-human CD19 (Cat# ab31947, Abcam; 1:50), Alexa Fluor 488 rat anti-human CD19 (Cat# 53-0194-82, eBioscience; 1:100), rabbit anti–human ICOSL (Cat# ab233151, Abcam; 1:50), rat anti–human IL-10 (Cat# 14-7108-85, eBioscience; 1:50), rat anti–human CD3 (Cat# ab11089, Abcam; 1:100), goat anti-mouse ICOSL (Cat# PA5-47161, ThermoFisher Scientific; 1:50), rat anti-mouse IL-10 (Cat# ab189392, Abcam; 1:50), rabbit anti-mouse CD19 (Cat# GTX101512, GeneTex; 1:100), mouse anti-human C3/C3b (Cat# ab11871, Abcam; 1:50), rat anti-mouse CD8 (Cat# MA1-70041, ThermoFisher Scientific; 1:100), rabbit anti-mouse Granzyme B (Cat# ab4059, Abcam; 1:200), rat anti-mouse CD4 (Cat# MA1-146, ThermoFisher Scientific; 1:200), mouse anti-mouse T-bet (Cat# ab91109, Abcam; 1:100), rabbit anti-mouse Foxp3 (Cat# ab215206, Abcam; 1:1000), rat anti-mouse C3b/iC3b/C3c (Cat# HM1065, Hycult Biotech; 1:50) and rabbit anti-mouse CD31 (Cat# ab28364, Abcam; 1:100) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Cat# A21202, Cat# A31570, Cat#A21206, Cat# A32794, Cat# A31573, Cat# A11006, Cat# A21434, Cat# A11055 or Cat# A21447, ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the experiment design. For the TUNEL assay, slides were stained using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Cat# 11684817910, Roche) at 37°C for 30 min after incubation with anti-mouse C3b/iC3b/C3c (Cat# HM1065, Hycult Biotech; 1:50) and Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (Cat# A21434, ThermoFisher Scientific). For CD31 and C3b/iC3b/C3c staining, tumors were collected 3 days after chemotherapy. For the TUNEL assay, tumors were harvested 24 days after chemotherapy. For the cell mounting slides, B cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS and blocked in PBS with 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After blockade, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse CD19 (Cat# GTX101512, GeneTex; 1:100) and goat anti-mouse ICOSL (Cat# PA5-47161, ThermoFisher Scientific; 1:50) at 4°C overnight, washed with PBS and stained with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (Cat# A11055 and Cat# A32794, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were counterstained with DAPI (Ca# D3571, ThermoFisher Scientific) and imaged using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a core data acquisition system (Applied Precision).
The images of entire clinical tissue sections were captured and deposited by the side scanner Axio Scan.Z1 (Zeiss). The scan of the slices was fully automated. The fluorescence signal was quantitated by the Automated Image Analysis with Background Subtraction (AIABS) method as previously described ( Brown et al., 2019; Schalper et al., 2015 10. Brown, J.R. ∙ Phongthachit, C. ∙ Sulkowski, M.J. Immunofluorescence and image analysis pipeline for Drosophila motor neurons Biol.

Objective measurement and clinical significance of TILs in non-small cell lung cancer J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2015; 107 Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar ). Briefly, non-tumoral area was manually excluded according to H&E staining of the serial sections. For post-treatment samples, the assessment was performed within the borders of the residual tumor bed, which was defined by the presence of the residual tumor cells. In the case of pCR, the tissue region as “area of regression” was identified by gross pathology findings and stroma reactions as previously reported by the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group on Breast Cancer ( Dieci et al., 2018; Hamy et al., 2017 13. Dieci, M.V. ∙ Radosevic-Robin, N. ∙ Fineberg, S. ..., International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group on Breast Cancer Update on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer, including recommendations to assess TILs in residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy and in carcinoma in situ: A report of the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group on Breast Cancer Semin.

Oncol. 2017; 28 :2233-2240 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the previous tumor bed was localized by preoperative imaging, including the placement of radiologic clips. The area of regression appeared as a white aspect of the breast parenchyma representing the previous tumor bed modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and was characterized by histiocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, fibrosis, and elastosis.
The whole immunofluorescence scanned images were divided into several small grids for analysis. The nuclei area was defined by detecting circular signals in the DAPI channel. Negative control was performed by omitting the primary antibody. Immunofluorescence signal was adjusted by subtracting negative control staining. An algorithm learning tool was performed by the Imaris 9.0. Analysis software package (Bitplane) to evaluate the percentage of ICOSL + B cells by dividing colocalizing spots of CD19 and ICOSL by CD19 positive spots in the sample ( Su et al., 2018a 54. Su, S. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yao, H. ... CD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer Stemness Cell. 2018; 172 :841-856.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (842) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We evaluated IHC images by IHC Profiler as an ImageJ plug-in in a blinded manner as previously described ( Varghese et al., 2014 59. Varghese, F. ∙ Bukhari, A.B. ∙ Malhotra, R. ... IHC Profiler: an open source plugin for the quantitative evaluation and automated scoring of immunohistochemistry images of human tissue samples PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e96801 Crossref Scopus (934) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we performed color deconvolution of IHC images by the set optical density vectors for DAB and hematoxylin. The cytoplasmic mode was selected to assess the expression of C3 or CD55 in tissue slices. The staining intensity was scored using the following scale: 0, no negative; 1, low positive; 2, positive; 3, high positive. The IHC score, which was determined by multiplying the staining intensity score and percentage of positive cells, was generated from all the girds of the slides. The average score was calculated for each sample. The theoretical limits of the scores ranged from 0 (0% cell staining) to 300 (100% cell staining at 3+ intensity).
Two operators (J. P. and Y. L.), who had no previous knowledge of the patients’ clinical backgrounds, visually validated the automated scores in a sub-sample group of 147 stained slides. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two operator performances was evaluated ( Figure S2 A). Scores were also rechecked randomly by a pathologist (Y. Z.). Defective samples or areas with staining artifacts were excluded.
The presence of TLOs was determined morphologically on H&E stained slides. Follicular aggregates of CD3 + T and CD19 + B cells were confirmed by the immunofluorescence staining. The samples with at least one TLO was defined as TLO positive samples. To quantitate the number of CD19 + ICOSL + and CD19 + ICOSL - cells with direct contact with CD3 + T cells, images were analyzed by Imaris 9.0 Microscopy Image Analysis Software as previously described ( Lehrman et al., 2018 32. Lehrman, E.K. ∙ Wilton, D.K. ∙ Litvina, E.Y. ... CD47 Protects Synapses from Excess Microglia-Mediated Pruning during Development Neuron. 2018; 100 :120-134.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the nucleus was defined in the DAPI channel, and spot channels were generated for the CD3, CD19 and ICOSL respectively. The number of CD19 + ICOSL - and CD19 + ICOSL + spots were determined by the CD19 spots that colocalized with ICOSL or not as aforementioned. CD19 + ICOSL - and CD19 + ICOSL + spots that were within 2.3 μm to CD3 spots were determined to be the B cells with direct contact to T cells. To quantitate mouse tissue samples, 10 view-fields at 400 × magnification per section were evaluated by Imaris 9.0 Microscopy Image Analysis Software as described above.
In silico analysis of human ICOSLG (ICOSL), CD55 (CD55), CD46 (CD46), CRIg (CRIg), CR1(CR1), CFH (CFH), CFI (CFI), FHL1 (FHL1), C4BP (C4BP), properdin (properdin) and C1INH (C1INH) mRNA expression was performed using breast cancer microarray gene datasets from the Oncomine database (Compendia Biosciences; http://www.oncomine.org ). Analysis of ICOSLG gene expression in human breast cancer tissues without or with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was conducted using the Sorlie breast database. Correlation analysis of ICOSLG and CD55 gene expression in human breast cancer tissues was conducted using the Curtis breast database. Analysis of CD55 (CD55), CD46 (CD46), CRIg (CRIg), CR1(CR1), CFH (CFH), CFI (CFI), FHL1 (FHL1), C4BP (C4BP), properdin (properdin) and C1INH (C1INH) gene expression in multiple breast cancer cell lines was conducted using the Barretina Cell Line database. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of breast cancer patients with low or high ICOSLG gene expression in human breast cancer tissues was conducted using the Wang breast database, vandeVijver breast and Curtis breast 2 database. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of breast cancer patients with low or high CD55 gene expression in human breast cancer tissues was conducted using the Zhang breast, Desmedt breast and Curtis breast database. Patients with benign breast tumors and DCIS were excluded from analysis. Patients without survival status were excluded from Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
We injected 5 × 10 5 E0771 cells (untreated, transduced with empty lentivirus vector or vector expressing CD55) or 1 × 10 5 4T1 cells into the fat pads of six-week-old female mice with C57/BL6 or BALB/C background, respectively. In some experiments, 3 × 10 6 TRAMP-C2 cells (transduced without or with lentivirus vector carrying GFP shRNA or CD55 shRNA) were subcutaneously injected into the flank of wild-type six-week-old male C57/BL6 mice. When the syngeneic grafts or spontaneous tumors of MMTV-PyMT mice were palpable, 6-8 mice per group were randomized for different treatments. PBS, doxorubicin (5 mg/kg unless stated otherwise in figure legends), carboplatin (50 mg/kg) or docetaxel (8 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally each week. The tumor volumes calculated by the formula: volume = width 2 × length/2 were recorded every 3 days. The animals were euthanized when the tumors reached approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. Cell suspensions were prepared from tumors or spleen as we previously described ( Su et al., 2017; Su et al., 2014 52. Su, S. ∙ Liu, Q. ∙ Chen, J. ...

Tumor tissues were washed with PBS and cut into small (1-2 mm) pieces and incubated in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mg/mL collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical), 2 mg/mL collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical) and 100 μg/mL DNase I (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C under constant shaking. During digestion, the tissue pieces in solution were vortexed every 15 min. Spleens were sliced into small pieces and placed onto a strainer attached to a 50 mL conical tube. The fragments were pressed through the strainer using the plunger end of a syringe and the strainer was washed with excess PBS to obtain the cell suspension. The cell suspensions were filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer, washed twice by PBS and subjected to further experiments.
To pharmaceutically deplete B cells in mice, the mice were treated with cocktail antibodies together with chemotherapy when the tumors were palpable. Rat anti–mouse CD19 (clone 1D3; BioXcell), rat anti-mouse B220 (clone RA3.3A1/6.1; BioXcell), and mouse anti-mouse CD22 (clone CY34.1; BioXcell) were mixed and injected i.p. weekly, each at 150 μg per mouse. After 48 h, the mice were injected with a secondary antibody (mouse anti-rat κ light chain; clone MAR 18.5; BioXcell) at 150 μg per mouse. In addition, mice were injected weekly, but not on the same day, with 250 μg per mouse rat anti-mouse CD20 (clone AISB12; BioXcell) for 4 weeks ( Keren et al., 2011; Shalapour et al., 2015 29.

Rat IgG2a (Cat# BE0089, BioXCell), IgG (Cat# BE0094, BioXCell) and mouse IgG1 (Cat# BE0083, BioXCell) were used as isotype controls.
To neutralize ICOSL in mice, 250 μg mouse anti-ICOSL antibody (clone HK5.3, BioXCell) or isotype control (Cat# BE0089, BioXcell) were injected i.p. every 2 days starting 3 days after tumor inoculation ( Baumjohann et al., 2013 6.

Persistent antigen and germinal center B cells sustain T follicular helper cell responses and phenotype Immunity. 2013; 38 :596-605 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To isolate tumor-infiltrating B cells from mice, E0771 syngeneic grafts inoculated in wild-type C57/BL6 mice with or without doxorubicin treatment (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks were mechanically dissociated, and single-cell suspensions were prepared as aforementioned. Different subsets of tumor-infiltrating B cells (CD19 + , CD19 + ICOSL + or CD19 + ICOSL - ) were sorted by FACS. The FACS was performed on single cell suspensions using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Before cell sorting, isolated cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1% FBS and incubated with antibody against FITC-CD45 (Cat# 103108, Biolegend), APC-CD19 (Cat# 115512, Biolegend) with or without PE-ICOSL (Cat# 107405, Biolegend) for 30 min at 4°C. To exclude dead cells, the cells were stained for Live/Dead Fixable Viability Dye (FVD-eFluor780, Cat# 65-0865-18, eBioscience) in PBS for 30 min at 4°C. The purity of the sorted populations was verified by flow cytometry on a Beckman CytoFLEX flow cytometer (98% pure). The viability and number of purified B cells were assessed using trypan blue (ThermoFisher Scientific) (at least 90% live cells).
To adoptively transfer tumor-infiltrating B cells, purified cells were washed in cold PBS and injected into recipient mice via the tail vein (1 × 10 6 cells per mouse in 100 μL volume) (CD19 + , CD19 + ICOSL + or CD19 + ICOSL - B cells). To adoptively transfer mature-naive B cells from mice, cell suspensions from spleens of wild-type C57/BL6 mice were obtained as aforementioned. The cell suspension was filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer, washed twice by PBS and resuspended in 5 mL of Mouse Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Cat# DKW33-R0100, DAKEWE). Then, the medium containing cells was transferred into a 15 mL conical tube and 1 mL PBS was gently layered above. The sample was centrifuged with the brake off (37°C, 800 × g, 30 min, Beckman) and the lymphocyte layer was transferred into a clean tube and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then incubated with antibody against CD19 (Cat# 152410, Biolegend), IgD (Cat# 405704, Biolegend) and IgM (Cat# 406508, Biolegend) for 30 min at 4°C. IgD + IgM + B cells and B cells depleted of IgD + IgM + B cells were sorted by FACS and injected into Jh −/− mice via the tail vein (2 × 10 6 cells per mouse in 100 μL volume).
In some experiments, the therapeutic effect was assessed by 18 F-flourodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT). Before PET/CT scanning, mice were fasted for 8 h, anesthetized with 400 mg/kg chloral hydrate, and injected with 5 uci/g 18 F-FDG in 100 μL saline via the tail vein. A 15 min static scan was performed 40 min after 18 F-FDG injection with an Inveon microPET/CT Scanner (Siemens). The micro PET images were corrected for attenuation, scatter, normalization, and camera dead time and co-registered with micro CT images. Quantification was performed by volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis using Inveon Research Workplace software (Siemens). Activity in triceps muscle was used as nontarget tissue uptake. Activity measurements (Bq/cm3) were divided by the decay-corrected injected dose (Bq) and multiplied by 100 to obtain a tissue uptake index expressed as % ID/g of tissue. Tumor to muscle (T:M) ratio was calculated as the ratio of % ID/g of tumor to that of muscle. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards and Animal Care and Use Committees of Sun Yat-Sen University.
Human AB serum, used as a source of complement, was freshly prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy donors as aforementioned. Heat inactivated-normal human serum was obtained by incubating normal human serum at 56°C for 30 min ( Mevorach et al., 1998 39. Mevorach, D. ∙ Mascarenhas, J.O. ∙ Gershov, D. ... Complement-dependent clearance of apoptotic cells by human macrophages J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188 :2313-2320 Crossref Scopus (601) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human serum with or without heat inactivation were stored at −80°C. Human tumor cell lines indicated in the figure legends were cultured in 24-well plates (5 × 10 3 cells per well) and treated with PBS with or without 1 μM doxorubicin for 24 h. The cells were then washed twice and incubated in 15% human serum (HS), or heat-inactivated normal human serum (IHS) at 37°C for 24 h. Afterward, cells and supernatants were collected for further analysis.
To block PS, doxorubicin-treated tumor cells were incubated with 1.6 mM annexin V (Cat# A9460, Sigma) in 200 μL annexin V binding buffer (Cat# 422201, Biolegend) for 10 min at 4°C before being cultured in 15% human serum ( Mevorach et al., 1998 39. Mevorach, D. ∙ Mascarenhas, J.O. ∙ Gershov, D. ... Complement-dependent clearance of apoptotic cells by human macrophages J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188 :2313-2320 Crossref Scopus (601) PubMed Google Scholar ). To inhibit caspase, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with doxorubicin in the presence of 100 μM z-VAD-fmk (Selleck) or z-DEVD-fmk (Selleck) for 24 h.
For immunofluorescence analysis, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed three times with PBS and blocked in PBS with 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After blockade, the cells were stained with mouse anti-human C3/C3b (Cat# ab11871, Abcam; 1:50), rabbit anti-human cleaved-PARP (Cat# 5625S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:50), or rabbit anti-human cleaved-caspase-3 (Cat# 9664S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000) at 4°C overnight. Afterward, the cells were washed with PBS and stained with DAPI and Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (Cat# A21202 and Cat# A32794, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
For flow cytometric analysis, the cells were digested by 10 × TrypLE Selected Enzyme (Cat# A1217701, GIBCO) diluted in PBS containing 1mM EDTA and then incubated at 4°C in PBS containing 2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA, APC-conjugated anti-human C3b/iC3b (1:20, Cat# 846106, Biolegend) and PI (1:50, Cat# 421301, Biolegend) or APC mouse IgG1 (1:20, Cat# 400120, Biolegend) for 15 min.
Tumor cells were homogenized by Ripa (Millipore) with proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Cat# 78446, ThermoFisher Scientific). Total protein was quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Cat# 23225, ThermoFisher Scientific). Equal amounts of lysates were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman Protran nitrocellulose membrane; neoLab). After blocking with TBS/0.05% Tween-20/5% skim milk, the membranes were probed with rabbit anti-human CD55 (Cat# NBP1-85466, Novus Biologicals; 1:500), rabbit anti-mouse CD55 (Cat# ab231061, Abcam; 1:200), cleaved-PARP (Cat# 5625S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), total-PARP (Cat# 9532S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), cleaved-caspase-3 (Cat# 9664S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), caspase-3 (Cat# 9662S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), β-tubulin (Cat# 10068-1-AP, Proteintech; 1:1000) or GAPDH (Cat# HRP-60004, Proteintech; 1:10000).
To confirm the conditional deletion of Cr2, protein was extracted from B cells isolated from the spleen of Cd19-Cr2 Δ , Cr2 flox/flox , and wild-type C57/BL6 mice, as aforementioned. Primary antibody against mouse CR2 (CD21) (Cat# ab75985, Abcam; 1:2000) was used. β-tubulin (Cat# 10068-1-AP, Proteintech; 1:1000) was used as the internal standard.
To evaluate C3-cleavage in tumors, tumor tissues were minced into small pieces (1-2 mm in diameter) with autoclaved surgical instruments in PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Cat# 78446, ThermoFisher Scientific) prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tumor pieces were homogenized with the TissueLyser II (QIAGEN GmbH). The protein concentrations in homogenized tumor samples were determined by a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer or the Bradford assay (Promega). Western blots were performed as aforementioned. Activated complements were detected using rat anti-mouse C3b/iC3b/C3c antibody (clone 2/11, Hycult Biotech, 1:200) or mouse anti-human C3/C3b antibody (Cat# ab11871, Abcam, 1:500) ( Mastellos et al., 2004 37. Mastellos, D. ∙ Prechl, J. ∙ László, G. ... Novel monoclonal antibodies against mouse C3 interfering with complement activation: description of fine specificity and applications to various immunoassays Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40 :1213-1221 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). β-tubulin (Cat# 10068-1-AP, Proteintech; 1:1000) was used as the internal standard for tissues ( Surace et al., 2015 56. Surace, L. ∙ Lysenko, V. ∙ Fontana, A.O. ... Complement is a central mediator of radiotherapy-induced tumor-specific immunity and clinical response Immunity. 2015; 42 :767-777 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Activated complements in the supernatant of doxorubicin-treated tumor cells were detected by using mouse anti-human C3/C3b antibody (Cat# ab11871, Abcam, 1:500). HRP-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Cat# 7074, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:3000), HRP-linked anti-mouse antibody (Cat# 7076, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:3000) and HRP-linked anti-rat antibody (Cat# 7077, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:3000) were used as secondary antibodies.
Primary human B cells were isolated from PBMCs of healthy donors as aforementioned and co-cultured with tumor cells (5:1) pretreated with or without doxorubicin in a 24-well plate for 72 h at 37°C in media containing 15% human serum or heat-inactivated human serum ( Bodogai et al., 2013; Inoue et al., 2006 8. Bodogai, M. ∙ Lee Chang, C. ∙ Wejksza, K. ... Anti-CD20 antibody promotes cancer escape via enrichment of tumor-evoked regulatory B cells expressing low levels of CD20 and CD137L Cancer Res. 2013; 73 :2127-2138 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Inoue, S. ∙ Leitner, W.W. ∙ Golding, B. ... Inhibitory effects of B cells on antitumor immunity Cancer Res. 2006; 66 :7741-7747 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). In some experiments, B cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL sheep anti-human CD21(CR2) antibody (Cat# AF4909, R&D Systems) or isotype control (Cat# 5-001-A, R&D Systems) at room temperature for 20 min before being co-cultured with tumor cells in media supplemented with 15% human serum ( Khandelwal et al., 2016 30. Khandelwal, S. ∙ Lee, G.M. ∙ Hester, C.G. ... The antigenic complex in HIT binds to B cells via complement and complement receptor 2 (CD21) Blood. 2016; 128 :1789-1799 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Afterward, B cells were retrieved by a CD19 Isolation Kit (Cat# 130-050-301, Miltenyi Biotec) and subjected to further experiments.
To obtain monocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from buffy coat of healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Cat# LTS1077, TBDscience) by density gradient centrifugation (37°C, 450 × g, 20 min) as aforementioned. Monocytes were isolated from PBMC by magnetic-activated cell sorting using Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit (Cat# 130-096-537, Miltenyi Biotec) and seeded into 24-well plates. Monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DC) were generated by culturing monocytes with 5 ng/mL IL-4 (Cat# 200-04, PeproTech) and 25 ng/mL GM-CSF (Cat# 300-03, PeproTech) for 6 days and the culture medium was changed every two days ( Su et al., 2018b 55. Su, S. ∙ Zhao, J. ∙ Xing, Y. ... Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Overcomes ADCP-Induced Immunosuppression by Macrophages Cell. 2018; 175 :442-457.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD8 + T cells and naive CD4 + T cells were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting using direct CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kit (Cat# 130-096-495, Miltenyi Biotec) and naive CD4 + T Cells Isolation Kit II (Cat# 130-094-131, Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions respectively. CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 25 mmol/L HEPES, 4 mmol/L L-glutamine, 25 μmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% FBS at 37°C. Media were replaced every 2 days. The purity of cell populations was more than 90% confirmed by flow cytometry.
Tumor-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were obtained as we previously described ( Su et al., 2017 53. Su, S. ∙ Liao, J. ∙ Liu, J. ... Blocking the recruitment of naive CD4 + T cells reverses immunosuppression in breast cancer Cell Res. 2017; 27 :461-482 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, DCs were matured by incubation with 100 ng/mL LPS (Cat# L2880, Sigma-Aldrich) and 500 U/mL IFN-γ (Cat# 300-02, PeproTech) for 48 h and then pulsed with lysates (200 μg protein/1 × 10 6 cells/mL) of indicated tumor cells. To obtain tumor lysates, tumor cells (1 × 10 7 to 2 × 10 7 ) were washed with PBS and subjected to five freeze (liquid nitrogen) and thaw (37°C water bath) cycles. After removal of large particles by centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C), the supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C until use. After 24 h, tumor-pulsed DCs were co-cultured with autologous CD8 + /CD4 + T (1:5) in the presence or absence of CD19 + B cells (T cells: B cells, 1:1) treated as aforementioned for five days ( Olkhanud et al., 2011 40. Olkhanud, P.B. ∙ Damdinsuren, B. ∙ Bodogai, M. ... Tumor-evoked regulatory B cells promote breast cancer metastasis by converting resting CD4 + T cells to T-regulatory cells Cancer Res. 2011; 71 :3505-3515 Crossref Scopus (493) PubMed Google Scholar ). In some experiments, 10 μg/mL mouse anti-human ICOSL-neutralizing antibody (clone: MIH12, Cat# 16-5889-82, eBioscience) or control IgG1 (Cat# 16-4714-82, eBioscience) were added in the co-culture ( Franzese et al., 2016 17. Franzese, O. ∙ Palermo, B. ∙ Di Donna, C. ... Polyfunctional Melan-A-specific tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells elicited by dacarbazine treatment before peptide-vaccination depends on AKT activation sustained by ICOS OncoImmunology. 2016; 5 :e1114203 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Tumor-specific CD8 + T cells generated as aforementioned were collected using CD8 Microbeads (Cat# 130-045-201, Miltenyi Biotec) and mixed with target tumor cells pre-stained with CMFDA (10:1) for 12 h. Afterward, cells were dyed with propidium iodide (Cat# 00-6990-50, eBioscience; 1:20) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Both CMFDA and propidium iodide positive cells were designated as killed tumor cells. Granzyme B (Cat# 515403, Biolegend) expression of CD8 + T cells were evaluated by intracellular staining and flow cytometry.
Lentivirus packaging was made by GenePharma Inc (Shanghai, China). A lentiviral vector plasmid pGag/Pol was used to construct the stable clones. In some experiments, E0771 cells were transduced with mouse CD55 gene (NM_010016.3) lentiviral overexpression vectors. Lentiviral shRNAs targeting CD55 were obtained from Genepharma and shRNA silencing sequences are listed in the KEY RESOURCES TABLE. The control shRNA targeted against green fluorescent protein (GFP) (5`- TGACCACCCTGACCTACGGCGTGCAGTGC-3`) was transduced as a negative control. Tumor cells transduction was performed as we described before ( Su et al., 2018a 54. Su, S. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yao, H. ... CD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer Stemness Cell. 2018; 172 :841-856.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (842) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 1 × 10 6 cells were transduced with the lentiviral vectors (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10 for E0771 cells and MOI of 40 for TRAMP-C2 cells) overnight at 37°C with 5 μg/mL polybrene (Sigma).
Information regarding statistical details and methods is indicated in the figure legends, text or methods. Data are presented as either mean or median of continuous values and analyzed for comparison of two groups by Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test respectively. X-Tile statistical software was used to group clinical samples. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare survival curves. We used X-tile statistical software to determine an optimal cutoff point by a minimal p value approach as we and others previously reported ( Wang et al., 2019 62. Wang, Y. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... Tumor-Contacted Neutrophils Promote Metastasis by a CD90-TIMP-1 Juxtacrine-Paracrine Loop Clin. Cancer Res. 2019; 25 :1957-1969 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to determine the independent prognostic factors. Pearson correlation and regression analysis were used to assess the relationship of ICOSL + B cells and C3 cleavage deposited or CD55 levels in tumors. The measurements of all statistical values were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 or SPSS 23.0, unless otherwise described in the figure legends or methods. Error bars in the experiments indicate standard error of the mean (SEM) or standard deviation (SD) as mentioned in figure legends for a minimum of three independent experiments.
The single-cell RNA sequencing data are available at the GEO database (accession number GSE135710 ) ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135710 ). For further details see the Key Resources Table.
