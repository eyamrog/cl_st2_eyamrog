Title: General Anesthesia Decouples Cortical Pyramidal Neurons


Abstract: Summary

The mystery of general anesthesia is that it specifically suppresses consciousness by disrupting feedback signaling in the brain, even when feedforward signaling and basic neuronal function are left relatively unchanged. The mechanism for such selectiveness is unknown. Here we show that three different anesthetics have the same disruptive influence on signaling along apical dendrites in cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in mice. We found that optogenetic depolarization of the distal apical dendrites caused robust spiking at the cell body under awake conditions that was blocked by anesthesia. Moreover, we found that blocking metabotropic glutamate and cholinergic receptors had the same effect on apical dendrite decoupling as anesthesia or inactivation of the higher-order thalamus. If feedback signaling occurs predominantly through apical dendrites, the cellular mechanism we found would explain not only how anesthesia selectively blocks this signaling but also why conscious perception depends on both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity.

Section: Introduction

The fundamental conundrum of anesthesia is that although there can be a total disruption of consciousness, there are very few direct effects on the basic firing properties of neurons ( Alkire et al., 2008 2. Alkire, M.T. ∙ Hudetz, A.G. ∙ Tononi, G. Consciousness and anesthesia Science. 2008; 322 :876-880 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been observed that anesthesia is associated with a decrease in feedback effectiveness throughout the cortex ( Figure 1 A, top; Lee et al., 2013; Mashour, 2014 38. Lee, U. ∙ Ku, S. ∙ Noh, G. ... Disruption of frontal-parietal communication by ketamine, propofol, and sevoflurane Anesthesiology. 2013; 118 :1264-1275 Crossref Scopus (321) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Mashour, G.A. Top-down mechanisms of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2014; 8 :115 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, cortical pyramidal neurons play a central role in feedback signaling between brain areas ( Harris and Shepherd, 2015 25. Harris, K.D. ∙ Shepherd, G.M. The neocortical circuit: themes and variations Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :170-181 Crossref Scopus (661) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A, bottom left) because their distal apical dendrites in layer 1 (L1) receive a large fraction of cortical feedback connections ( Larkum, 2013 35. Larkum, M. A cellular mechanism for cortical associations: an organizing principle for the cerebral cortex Trends Neurosci. 2013; 36 :141-151 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been hypothesized that the action of anesthesia might be downregulation of the distal dendritic compartment in layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons ( Llinás and Ribary, 2001; Meyer, 2015 40. Llinás, R. ∙ Ribary, U. Consciousness and the brain. The thalamocortical dialogue in health and disease Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2001; 929 :166-175 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar 47. Meyer, K. The role of dendritic signaling in the anesthetic suppression of consciousness Anesthesiology. 2015; 122 :1415-1431 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is also possible that the influence of feedback signals could be affected by regulation of the coupling between these two compartments ( Figure 1 A, black arrow).
To investigate this question, we optogenetically generated a depolarization in the distal apical dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons, mimicking feedback input to L1 of the neocortex ( Figure 1 A, bottom right). Using this “forward” approach ( Hallez et al., 2007 26. Hallez, H. ∙ Vanrumste, B. ∙ Grech, R. ... Review on solving the forward problem in EEG source analysis J NeuroEngineering Rehabil. 2007; 4 Crossref Scopus (387) PubMed Google Scholar ), we kept the influence of feedback to dendrites constant, allowing us to concentrate on the cellular as opposed to the network effects of anesthesia. The light-activatable cation channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) ( Boyden et al., 2005; Nagel et al., 2003 6. Boyden, E.S. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ Bamberg, E. ... Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8 :1263-1268 Crossref Scopus (3719) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Nagel, G. ∙ Szellas, T. ∙ Huhn, W. ... Channelrhodopsin-2, a directly light-gated cation-selective membrane channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :13940-13945 Crossref Scopus (2120) PubMed Google Scholar ) was expressed in L5 pyramidal neurons, and light was delivered to the distal apical dendrites using a micro-optical tool (μPeriscope; Suzuki and Larkum, 2017 62. Suzuki, M. ∙ Larkum, M.E. Dendritic calcium spikes are clearly detectable at the cortical surface Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :276 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) capable of layer-specific light illumination ( Figure 1 A, bottom right). We combined this with sequential, layer-specific electrical recordings using glass pipettes at variable depths ( Figure 1 A, bottom right). ChR2 was expressed in L5 pyramidal neurons via injection of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) construct to L5 of the primary somatosensory cortex in an Rbp4-Cre transgenic mouse line ( Figure 1 B) where Cre recombinase is predominantly expressed in L5 pyramidal neurons ( Beltramo et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2007 3. Beltramo, R. ∙ D’Urso, G. ∙ Dal Maschio, M. ... Layer-specific excitatory circuits differentially control recurrent network dynamics in the neocortex Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :227-234 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Gong, S. ∙ Doughty, M. ∙ Harbaugh, C.R. ... Targeting Cre recombinase to specific neuron populations with bacterial artificial chromosome constructs J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :9817-9823 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the μPeriscope, we could deliver a narrow beam of light (∼200–250 μm; Suzuki and Larkum, 2017 62. Suzuki, M. ∙ Larkum, M.E. Dendritic calcium spikes are clearly detectable at the cortical surface Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :276 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the upper layers, which caused depolarization specifically in the distal dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons expressing ChR2 ( Figure 1 C). This approach provided a precise measurement of the dipole created across L5 pyramidal neurons that has long been thought to be the major contributing factor to electroencephalogram (EEG) and other extracellular recording methods ( Einevoll et al., 2013 16. Einevoll, G.T. ∙ Kayser, C. ∙ Logothetis, N.K. ... Modelling and analysis of local field potentials for studying the function of cortical circuits Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14 :770-785 Crossref Scopus (516) PubMed Google Scholar ). The response evoked by optogenetically depolarizing the dendrites was equivalent to the sensory responses over reasonable stimulus intensities ( Figure S1 A). By switching gaseous isoflurane anesthesia on and off, we could manipulate the animals’ conscious state ( Figure S1 B; Ferezou et al., 2007; Haider et al., 2013; McGinley et al., 2015 17.

Waking State: Rapid Variations Modulate Neural and Behavioral Responses Neuron. 2015; 87 :1143-1161 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (464) PubMed Google Scholar ) while leaving other experimental conditions (e.g., the μPeriscope and electrodes) unchanged.

Section: Results

Interestingly, we did not observe a marked difference in the dendritic response to optogenetic stimulation of distal apical dendrites in the awake state versus the anesthetized state ( Figure 1 D top left; see Figure S1 C for the grand average). We expect that the overwhelming effect of the current through ChR2 channels masked any non-linearity because of other conductances. Strikingly, however, the somatic response recorded in L5 was markedly different depending on the brain state ( Figure 1 D, bottom left). Decomposing the somatic response to high- and low-frequency components ( Figure 1 D, right), we found that both components were almost completely abolished in the anesthetized state ( Figures 1 E and 1F; both p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 7 mice), implying that anesthesia significantly decouples the signaling from the distal dendrite to the soma across L5 neurons. The high-frequency component showed spike-like events reminiscent of a population spike with multiple action potentials (APs). The first somatic spike-like event (red arrow in Figure 1 D, bottom left) came with short latency (5.9 ± 0.4 ms, mean ± SEM; n = 7 mice) after the onset of light given to the distal apical dendrites, suggesting that the dendritic compartment is very well coupled to the somatic compartment in the awake state. The amplitude of the dendritic response increased proportionally to the light intensity of the stimulus ( Figures S1 D and S1E) in both awake and anesthetized states. However, although both components of the somatic response also increased proportionally to the stimulus intensity under awake conditions, the somatic response was largely independent of the stimulus intensity under anesthetized conditions ( Figures S1 D and S1E), consistent with powerful decoupling of the soma from the distal dendritic compartment. This effect was equivalent with different anesthetic agents with very different molecular targets (isoflurane, ketamine/xylazine, and urethane; Figure S1 F), suggesting that the coupling of distal and proximal compartments across pyramidal neurons might be a general target of anesthesia. This state-dependent change of coupling was also observed in other cortical areas ( Figures S2 A–S2D), suggesting the generality of this finding over the neocortex. On the other hand, L2/3 pyramidal neurons did not exhibit this state-dependent change of coupling ( Figures S2 E and S2F).
Next we tested whether enhanced coupling reflected output APs at the somata of pyramidal neurons. Using the “optopatcher” method ( Katz et al., 2013; Muñoz et al., 2014 30. Katz, Y. ∙ Yizhar, O. ∙ Staiger, J. ... Optopatcher--an electrode holder for simultaneous intracellular patch-clamp recording and optical manipulation J. Neurosci. Methods. 2013; 214 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Muñoz, W. ∙ Tremblay, R. ∙ Rudy, B. Channelrhodopsin-assisted patching: in vivo recording of genetically and morphologically identified neurons throughout the brain Cell Rep. 2014; 9 :2304-2316 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) involving single-cell juxtacellular recordings, we recorded APs directly from identified ChR2-positive L5 pyramidal cells ( Figures 2 A and S3 ). These recordings showed fast-evoked and stereotypically timed somatic APs during wakefulness versus reduced and delayed somatic APs during anesthesia ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Consistent with the identified single-cell recordings, multi-unit activity was also significantly higher in L5 because of optogenetic activation of dendrites during wakefulness compared with anesthetized states (p = 0.0312, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 6 mice; Figures 2 D–2F). Consistent with these data, we found that microinjection of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 3 μM, 50 nL) into L5 also abolished the fast somatic component (all p < 0.05 in 3 mice, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figures S4 A–S4C). We conclude that the events underlying the fast component were somatic APs of L5 pyramidal neurons.
We were concerned that light activation of the distal dendrites might activate antidromic APs in the axons of L5 cells in the upper layers. To test this, we created definitive axonal input using trans -callosal activation of axons from the same neurons with light in the contralateral hemisphere. This showed delayed response in L5 ( Figures S4 D–S4G) that was much weaker than the response to direct dendritic depolarization ( Figures 1 D–1F). Importantly, antidromic APs caused very similar somatic responses in both the awake and anesthetized states. Moreover, we repeated the original experiment, depolarizing dendrites with light using another transgenic mouse line, Sim1-Cre , which expresses Cre recombinase in a subset of L5 neurons, pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in L5b, which predominantly project subcortically with significantly fewer axons in L1 and L2 compared with other L5 cells ( Brown and Hestrin, 2009; Harris and Shepherd, 2015; Kim et al., 2015 8.

Harris, K.D. ∙ Shepherd, G.M. The neocortical circuit: themes and variations Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :170-181 Crossref Scopus (661) PubMed Google Scholar 32.

Three Types of Cortical Layer 5 Neurons That Differ in Brain-wide Connectivity and Function Neuron. 2015; 88 :1253-1267 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even in Sim1-Cre mice, we consistently observed wakefulness-enhanced somatic responses upon dendritic stimulation (p = 0.0312, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 6 mice; Figures S4 H and S4I). Collectively, these data indicate that antidromic activation of APs evokes only a small delayed population signal in L5 in both anesthetized and awake states. Antidromic Aps, therefore, did not contribute significantly to the overall signal and were not characterized by fast, stereotypically timed APs. On the other hand, dendritic depolarization is known to evoke somatic APs with stereotypical timing in short high-frequency bursts ( Williams and Stuart, 1999 67. Williams, S.R. ∙ Stuart, G.J. Mechanisms and consequences of action potential burst firing in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons J. Physiol. 1999; 521 :467-482 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). We conclude that anesthesia prevents dendritic depolarization from generating somatic APs and, therefore, the effectiveness of feedback input arriving at the distal dendrites. We define “coupling” as the effect of dendritic depolarization on the generation of somatic APs; therefore, from here on, we focus mainly on the fast component. Note, however, that the changes in the fast component always correlated with changes in the slow component.
What underlies decoupling of the signals along the apical dendritic axis ( Figure 1 A)? To investigate this, we measured the profile of dendritic responses and the propagation of signals along apical dendrites during wakefulness and anesthesia using a finer resolution of recording positions (50-μm intervals; Figures 3 A and 3B). This profile confirmed that dendritic responses reliably propagated to the soma and evoked fast spikes during wakefulness ( Figure 3 B, awake) but were significantly attenuated with late (>10 ms after light onset), if any, somatic APs during anesthesia ( Figure 3 B, anesthesia). Averaging across recordings for each depth revealed that the signal was not dependent on brain state for recordings close to dendrites but began to diverge in the proximal region of apical shaft dendrites around a depth of 400–450 μm ( Figure 3 B, right), confirming that the mechanism for decoupling signals under anesthesia did not act directly on the distal dendritic compartment but, rather, on the propagation of signals to cell bodies. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that antagonists of L-type Ca 2+ and NMDA channels did not significantly reduce generation of APs at the cell body ( Figures 4 A–4C). Here, an L-type Ca 2+ channel blocker (nifedipine, 43 μM, 50 nL) and an NMDA receptor blocker (APV, 500 μM, 50 nL) injected to superficial layers significantly reduced the dendritic responses (p < 0.05 in all 3 mice for APV and in 3 of 4 mice for nifedipine, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 4 C); however, they did not impair the fast somatic component (all p > 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, n = 3 mice for both APV and nifedipine; Figure 4 B).
It has been shown in vitro that coupling of the dendritic and somatic compartments in L5 pyramidal neurons is extremely sensitive to the depolarization state of the proximal apical dendrite ( Larkum et al., 2001; Schaefer et al., 2003 36. Larkum, M.E. ∙ Zhu, J.J. ∙ Sakmann, B. Dendritic mechanisms underlying the coupling of the dendritic with the axonal action potential initiation zone of adult rat layer 5 pyramidal neurons J. Physiol. 2001; 533 :447-466 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Schaefer, A.T. ∙ Larkum, M.E. ∙ Sakmann, B. ... Coincidence detection in pyramidal neurons is tuned by their dendritic branching pattern J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89 :3143-3154 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore possible that depolarization caused during the awake state is responsible for the enhanced coupling between the dendritic and somatic compartments. On the other hand, anesthesia is often characterized by slow alternation between so-called up and down states ( Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996 68. Wilson, C.J. ∙ Kawaguchi, Y. The origins of two-state spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations of neostriatal spiny neurons J. Neurosci. 1996; 16 :2397-2410 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Up states are commonly assumed to resemble awake states because cells are significantly depolarized in both states ( Alkire et al., 2008; Constantinople and Bruno, 2011; Destexhe et al., 2003 2. Alkire, M.T. ∙ Hudetz, A.G. ∙ Tononi, G. Consciousness and anesthesia Science. 2008; 322 :876-880 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar 12. Constantinople, C.M. ∙ Bruno, R.M. Effects and mechanisms of wakefulness on local cortical networks Neuron. 2011; 69 :1061-1068 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar 15. Destexhe, A. ∙ Rudolph, M. ∙ Paré, D. The high-conductance state of neocortical neurons in vivo Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4 :739-751 Crossref Scopus (817) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we found that decoupling of the dendritic and somatic compartments associated with anesthesia continued to be effective in both up and down states ( Figures S5 A–S5C), and both were significantly different from the robust coupling in the awake state (both p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc multiple comparisons, n = 5 mice; Figure S5 D). This is consistent with the fact that up states do not lead to consciousness and suggests that coupling of feedback signals through L5 pyramidal neurons is not simply a function of the depolarization state of the neurons. We also tested whether the type of awake state was a determining factor by comparing the change in coupling between two awake states—actively behaving versus quietly resting states—but found no significant difference (all p > 0.5, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, n = 3 mice; Figures S5 E and S5F).
Because depolarization alone was not responsible for the effects we observed on coupling (i.e., the up and down states were equivalent), we looked at the effect of various neuromodulators that have been shown to correlate with the brain state and affect neuronal properties ( Constantinople and Bruno, 2011; Labarrera et al., 2018; McCormick, 1993; McGinley et al., 2015; Muñoz et al., 2017; Polack et al., 2013 12.

Neurosci. 2013; 16 :1331-1339 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). The neuromodulators acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline (NA) activate not only pyramidal cells ( McCormick, 1993; McCormick et al., 1991 44. McCormick, D.A. Actions of acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex and thalamus and implications for function Prog. Brain Res. 1993; 98 :303-308 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar 45.

Bergles, D.E. ∙ Doze, V.A. ∙ Madison, D.V. ... Excitatory actions of norepinephrine on multiple classes of hippocampal CA1 interneurons J.

Layer-specific modulation of neocortical dendritic inhibition during active wakefulness Science. 2017; 355 :954-959 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). The net effect of these neuromodulators on dendro-somatic coupling is therefore hard to predict. We measured the somatic response to dendritic stimulation upon pharmacological application of ACh antagonists (both ionotropic and metabotropic) and NA antagonists during the awake state ( Figures 5 A–5E). Both ACh and NA blockers significantly reduced the amplitude of dendritic responses ( Figures 5 C and 5E), but, surprisingly, only ACh blockers significantly reduced the wakefulness-enhanced somatic responses (all p < 0.005, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, n = 4 mice; Figures 5 B and 5D) whereas NA blockers did not (all p > 0.05, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, n = 4 mice; Figures 5 B and 5D). Again, we interpret the lack of action of the NA blocker to indicate that the artificially induced ChR2 conductance overrides the (known) effect of NA on activity of the distal compartment ( Labarrera et al., 2018 34. Labarrera, C. ∙ Deitcher, Y. ∙ Dudai, A. ... Adrenergic Modulation Regulates the Dendritic Excitability of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons In Vivo Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :1034-1044 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further found that a muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist (1 mM atropine, 50 nL) significantly impaired fast somatic responses whereas a nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist (1 mM mecamylamine, 50 nL) did not ( Figures 5 F–5J), indicating a significant contribution of muscarinic ACh receptors to enhanced dendro-somatic coupling.
A long-standing hypothesis regarding the action of anesthesia is decoupling of thalamocortical interactions ( Alkire et al., 2000; Llinás and Ribary, 2001 1. Alkire, M.T. ∙ Haier, R.J. ∙ Fallon, J.H.

Sci. 2001; 929 :166-175 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). This hypothesis appears to be orthogonal to the “cortico-cortical” explanation involving disruption of cortical-cortical feedback ( Mashour, 2014 42. Mashour, G.A. Top-down mechanisms of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2014; 8 :115 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the failure of signaling in the bottom third of the apical dendritic axis appears at first glance to be an intrinsically cortical phenomenon. However, this region of the cortex receives a strong projection from higher-order thalamic nuclei that are known to have a neuromodulatory influence because of activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs; Sherman, 2014 61. Sherman, S.M. The function of metabotropic glutamate receptors in thalamus and cortex Neuroscientist. 2014; 20 :136-149 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the primary somatosensory cortex, the posteromedial nucleus (POm) is an associated higher-order thalamic nucleus that has a significant projection to cortical L5a as well as to L1 ( Wimmer et al., 2010 69. Wimmer, V.C. ∙ Bruno, R.M. ∙ de Kock, C.P. ... Dimensions of a projection column and architecture of VPM and POm axons in rat vibrissal cortex Cereb. Cortex. 2010; 20 :2265-2276 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 6 A) and is known to play a role in cortical state ( Alkire et al., 2000; Llinás and Ribary, 2001 1. Alkire, M.T. ∙ Haier, R.J. ∙ Fallon, J.H. Toward a unified theory of narcosis: brain imaging evidence for a thalamocortical switch as the neurophysiologic basis of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness Conscious.

Sci. 2001; 929 :166-175 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore measured the effect of the mGluR blocker (R,S)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG; 1.2 mM, 50 nL) and found that local injection of MCPG strikingly impaired coupling, abolishing the somatic response ( Figure 6 B) while not significantly affecting nearby background activity in the injected region (L2–L4 at 200–500 μm from the pia; p = 0.625, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 5 mice; Figure 6 D). Consistent with this observation, POm activity was significantly elevated during wakefulness compared with anesthetized states ( Masri et al., 2008 43. Masri, R. ∙ Bezdudnaya, T. ∙ Trageser, J.C. ... Encoding of stimulus frequency and sensor motion in the posterior medial thalamic nucleus J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100 :681-689 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) (all p < 0.0005, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 4 mice; Figures S6 A and S6B), and inactivation of the POm with the GABA A receptor agonist muscimol (0.5 mM, 50 nL) significantly impaired coupling (p < 0.05 in all 4 mice, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figures 6 E–6H).
Higher-order thalamic nuclei are known to significantly contribute to conscious perception, attentional control ( Saalmann et al., 2012; Schmitt et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2016 57.

To examine whether anesthetic-induced downregulation is a general characteristic of higher-order thalamic nuclei, we studied another higher-order, visually associated thalamic nucleus, the pulvinar, and, for comparison, the first-order somatosensory thalamic nucleus, the ventral POm (VPM). The pulvinar was downregulated by isoflurane anesthesia ( Figures S6 C and S6D), similarly to the POm, whereas the VPM remained active and strongly responded to a sensory stimulus (air puff) during anesthesia ( Figures S6 E and S6F), consistent with previous studies ( Brecht and Sakmann, 2002; Castro-Alamancos, 2002; Deschênes et al., 2003; Minnery et al., 2003 7.

The mechanism for anesthesia has often been linked with inhibition because almost all anesthetics upregulate GABA A receptors ( Franks, 2008 19. Franks, N.P. General anaesthesia: from molecular targets to neuronal pathways of sleep and arousal Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9 :370-386 Crossref Scopus (1029) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, dendrite-targeting somatostatin-positive neurons have been associated with mGluRs ( Dalezios et al., 2002; Ferraguti and Shigemoto, 2006 13. Dalezios, Y. ∙ Luján, R. ∙ Shigemoto, R. ... Enrichment of mGluR7a in the presynaptic active zones of GABAergic and non-GABAergic terminals on interneurons in the rat somatosensory cortex Cereb. Cortex. 2002; 12 :961-974 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar 18. Ferraguti, F. ∙ Shigemoto, R. Metabotropic glutamate receptors Cell Tissue Res. 2006; 326 :483-504 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore wondered whether anesthetic-induced decoupling was induced by dendrite-targeting inhibition from somatostatin-positive (SOM + ) interneurons. We tested this possibility by expressing inhibitory DREADD (hM4D(Gi)) ( Krashes et al., 2011 33. Krashes, M.J. ∙ Koda, S. ∙ Ye, C. ... Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :1424-1428 Crossref Scopus (1069) PubMed Google Scholar ) in SOM + interneurons ( Figures S7 A and S7B) and found that inactivating SOM + interneurons did not enhance coupling of pyramidal neurons ( Figure S7 C). To further examine the contribution of other interneurons, we applied the GABA A receptor antagonist gabazine (5 μM, 100 nL) or the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (100 μM, 100 nL). Neither of these antagonists enhanced coupling of pyramidal neurons ( Figures S7 D and S7E). Together, these results suggest that the mechanism for decoupling during anesthesia does not depend on interneurons. However, we do not exclude the possibility that interneurons nevertheless have an influence on dendritic excitability per se because there may be other circuit mechanisms that can explain the observations above. For instance, they might exert dendritic branch-specific ( Cichon and Gan, 2015 11. Cichon, J. ∙ Gan, W.B. Branch-specific dendritic Ca(2+) spikes cause persistent synaptic plasticity Nature. 2015; 520 :180-185 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ) or dendritic region-specific modulation ( Muñoz et al., 2017; Murayama et al., 2009 50.

Layer-specific modulation of neocortical dendritic inhibition during active wakefulness Science. 2017; 355 :954-959 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar 51.

Section: Discussion

The present results show that wakefulness makes activation of distal dendrites highly effective in generating somatic APs ( Figure 7 A), indicating enhanced dendrite-to-soma coupling. We controlled activation of distal dendrites using an optogenetic approach ( Figure 7 A, μPeriscope) bypassing the difficulty of controlling feedback connectivity. Interestingly, the current sink created by light-activated depolarization of the distal dendritic compartment was very similar under anesthetized and awake conditions ( Figure 7 A, top). It is possible that anesthesia normally suppresses the dendritic compartment directly ( Potez and Larkum, 2008 54. Potez, S. ∙ Larkum, M.E. Effect of common anesthetics on dendritic properties in layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 99 :1394-1407 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) but that, using the approach taken here, the currents generated by activation of ChR2 masked these effects. If so, then it would mean that the effect of anesthesia on signaling of the tuft to the soma would normally be even greater; however, anesthesia apparently completely suppresses the effect of optogenetic stimulation in any case. Consistent with this, we saw no difference between the amplitude of the dendritic response during anesthetized and awake states over a range of different light intensities ( Figures S1 C–S1E). Despite the similarity of dendritic activation, we saw clear differences in the responses of the somatic compartment in the lower cortical layers ( Figure 7 A, center) as well as a clear difference in spontaneous spiking of neurons in the POm ( Figure 7 A, bottom). Coupling was most successfully blocked by application of an mGluR blocker (MCPG) but also substantially by blockers of muscarinic (i.e., metabotropic) cholinergic receptors. A previous in vitro study has shown that activation of mGluRs mobilizes inositol triphosphate (IP 3 ) and evokes large Ca 2+ waves ( Larkum et al., 2003 37. Larkum, M.E. ∙ Watanabe, S. ∙ Nakamura, T. ... Synaptically activated Ca2+ waves in layer 2/3 and layer 5 rat neocortical pyramidal neurons J. Physiol. 2003; 549 :471-488 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) whose functional role is largely unknown ( Ross, 2012 56. Ross, W.N. Understanding calcium waves and sparks in central neurons Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13 :157-168 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). In general, the effects of activating mGluRs is likely to have diverse downstream effects on excitability ( Kim et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2018 31. Kim, C.H. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Lee, J.Y. ... Metabotropic glutamate receptors: phosphorylation and receptor signaling J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar 70.

Physiol. 2018; 596 :4141-4156 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The data together suggest that anesthesia disrupts active maintenance of coupling along the apical dendritic axis by metabotropic activity in the proximal dendritic compartment of L5 neurons. In this scenario, if the anesthetic downregulates higher-order thalamic input to the cortex ( Figure 7 B, 5 and 6), then this would decrease the influence of input ( Figure 7 B, 1) to the distal compartment of deep-layer pyramidal neurons ( Figure 7 B, 2) by downregulating coupling between the distal and proximal compartments ( Figure 7 B, 3). De-coupling of signaling across pyramidal neurons would therefore lead to a decrease in the output of cortical columns because of distal dendritic input ( Figure 7 B, 4). Because distal dendritic input is dominated by long-range feedback input ( Cauller, 1995; Rockland, 1998 10. Cauller, L. Layer I of primary sensory neocortex: where top-down converges upon bottom-up Behav. Brain Res. 1995; 71 :163-170 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Rockland, K.S. Complex microstructures of sensory cortical connections Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8 :545-551 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), the overall effect would be widespread decoupling of feedback throughout the cortex. This scenario is also consistent with the fact that anesthetics do not significantly alter the influence of feedforward sensory input to the cortex ( Imas et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2012 29. Imas, O.A. ∙ Ropella, K.M. ∙ Ward, B.D. ... Volatile anesthetics disrupt frontal-posterior recurrent information transfer at gamma frequencies in rat Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 387 :145-150 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Lee, U. ∙ Ku, S. ∙ Noh, G. ...

Brain Mapp. 2012; 33 :2487-2498 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) because this pathway should predominantly influence synaptic input to the somatic compartment.
There is so far no consensus about how anesthetics interfere with consciousness ( Hudetz, 2012 28. Hudetz, A.G. General anesthesia and human brain connectivity Brain Connect. 2012; 2 :291-302 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the main two hypotheses posit that either the influence of feedback connectivity in cortico-cortical loops is disrupted ( Boly et al., 2011; Mashour, 2014 5. Boly, M. ∙ Garrido, M.I. ∙ Gosseries, O. ... Preserved feedforward but impaired top-down processes in the vegetative state Science. 2011; 332 :858-862 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Mashour, G.A. Top-down mechanisms of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2014; 8 :115 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ) or that higher-order thalamo-cortical loops are disrupted ( Alkire et al., 2008; Llinás and Ribary, 2001 2. Alkire, M.T. ∙ Hudetz, A.G. ∙ Tononi, G. Consciousness and anesthesia Science. 2008; 322 :876-880 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Llinás, R. ∙ Ribary, U. Consciousness and the brain. The thalamocortical dialogue in health and disease Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2001; 929 :166-175 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 C). Here we offer a theory of general anesthesia that reconciles these two competing explanations. The fact that inactivation of POm impaired coupling of cortical L5 pyramidal cells suggests that the contribution of higher-order thalamic nuclei to conscious perception is vital by remotely controlling the sensitivity of cortical pyramidal neurons to feedback signals that arrive at distal apical dendrites. However, in general, the theory rests on the fact that coupling of integration zones along the apical axis of pyramidal neurons is a fulcrum on which a large fraction of long-range cortical connectivity depends. In principle, therefore, according to this theory, any effect brought on by anesthesia that leads to disruption of signaling along this axis would lead to loss of consciousness. This might also explain how different anesthetics with multiple targets all specifically lead to loss of consciousness. It could therefore crucially control factors such as integrated information (or phi; Tononi et al., 2016 64. Tononi, G. ∙ Boly, M. ∙ Massimini, M. ... Integrated information theory: from consciousness to its physical substrate Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :450-461 Crossref Scopus (878) PubMed Google Scholar ) while having very little effect on the firing properties of neurons per se, consistent with this major unexplained fact about anesthesia. If so, this would also be relevant to our understanding of consciousness, although we emphasize that this is likely to be far more complex, involving factors not explored in this study. Nevertheless, because the coupling mechanism intrinsically involves the apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons, this explanation of general anesthesia only makes sense in light of a crucial contribution of these dendrites to the operation of the cortex ( Larkum, 2013 35.

The age of studied mice was P40-70. Both male and female mice were used. No food or water restriction was imposed. All studied mice were in good health. Mice were housed in single-sex groups. Mice were housed in plastic cages with disposable bedding on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum . Experiments were done during both dark and light phase. All procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the guidelines given by the veterinary office of Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin.
Rbp4-Cre, Sim1-Cre, Rasgrf2-2A-dCre and SST-IRES-Cre mice were initially anesthetized with Isoflurane (1%–2.5% in O 2 vol/vol, Abbott) before ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (75/10 mg per kg of body weight, respectively) was administered intraperitoneally. Lidocaine (1% wt/vol, Braun) was injected around the surgical site. Body temperature was maintained at ∼36°C by a heating pad and the depth of anesthesia was monitored throughout the virus injection. Once anesthetized, the head was stabilized in a stereotaxic instrument (SR-5R, Narishige, Tokyo). The skull was exposed by a skin incision and a small hole (∼0.5 × 0.5 mm 2 ) was made above the hindlimb area of the primary somatosensory cortex (0.5 mm posterior to bregma and 1.5 mm from midline), the frontal cortex (1.0 mm anterior to bregma and 1.0 mm from midline) or the visual cortex (3.0 mm posterior to bregma and 2.5 mm from midline). AAV1.EF1a.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH (Addgene 20298) from the University of Pennsylvania Viral Vector Core or Addgene was injected to Rbp4-Cre, Sim1-Cre and Rasgrf2-2A-dCre mice. AAV1.CaMKIIa. hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (Addgene 26969) from the University of Pennsylvania Viral Vector Core or Addgene and AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (Addgene 44362) from Addgene was injected to SST-IRES-Cre. Each construct was backloaded into a glass micropipette (Drummond) and was slowly injected (at 20 mL per min, total amount 40-50 nL to L5 for ChR2, total amount 100 nL to 300 m and 700 μm deep for DREADD). The pipette remained there for another 2-5 min after injection. The skin was sutured after retracting the pipette. Rasgrf2-2A-dCre mice were subsequently injected with trimethoprim (TMP, 150 μg per g of body weight) intraperitoneally.
A custom-made μPeriscope ( Suzuki and Larkum, 2017 62. Suzuki, M. ∙ Larkum, M.E. Dendritic calcium spikes are clearly detectable at the cortical surface Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :276 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) whose tip was a 0.1 × 0.1 mm 2 or 0.18 × 0.18 mm 2 right-angle prism was inserted to L1 for stimulating the distal apical dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons with blue light (λ = 473 nm). The timing of the optical stimulation was controlled by Power1401 and Spike2 software (CED) and synchronized with the neural recording system via TTL signals. The light intensity was varied between 2-12 mW/mm 2 whereas the duration was kept 20 ms.
Animals were initially anesthetized by Isoflurane (1% in O 2 , vol/vol, Abbott). For comparing anesthetic agents, either urethane (0.05 mg per kg of body weight, n = 3 mice) or ketamine/xylazine (75/10 mg per kg of body weight, respectively, n = 3 mice) was injected intraperitoneally. Lidocaine (1%, wt/vol, Braun) was injected around the surgical site. Body temperature was maintained at ∼36 degrees by a heating pad and the depth of anesthesia was monitored throughout the experiment. Once anesthetized, the head was stabilized in the stereotaxic instrument and the skull was exposed by a skin incision. A ∼1 × 1 mm 2 craniotomy was made above the hindlimb area of the primary somatosensory cortex (0.5 mm posterior to bregma and 1.5 mm from midline), the frontal cortex (1.0 mm anterior to bregma and 1.0 mm from midline), the visual cortex (3.0 mm anterior to bregma and 2.5 mm from midline), the posteromedial and pulvinar thalamic nucleus (1.8 mm posterior to bregma and 1.2 mm from midline) and/or the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus (1.8 mm posterior to bregma and 1.7 mm from midline). A pair of tungsten microelectrodes (one at 700 μm deep, the other at 200 μm deep) and a μPeriscope inserted to L1 were fixed to the skull with dental cement if mice were subsequently allowed to freely move in a rectangular arena (60 cm × 40 cm). For head-fixed animals, an aluminum head implant was fixed to the skull with dental cement; a single glass pipette or a 16 channel probe (ASSY-1, Cambridge NeuroTech, Cambridge) and a μPeriscope were independently inserted by micromanipulators (SM-15M, Narishige, Tokyo). For awake recordings, animal behavior was monitored after Isoflurane was stopped. Recordings started only after active and natural movements of limbs, tail and whiskers were frequently observed. Animal behavior was monitored throughout recordings. For treadmill walking ( Figure S5 ), mice were habituated to head-fixation and walking on a custom-designed motorized treadmill. In each trial a mouse walked on the treadmill for 4 s and the blue light through the μPeriscope was given at 2 s after the treadmill onset. To measure the coupling during quiet rest, recordings were made only when no spontaneous movement of limbs, tail and whiskers was measured. Electrical activity was bandpass filtered at 1-9 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, amplified by ERP-27 system and Cheetah software (Neuralynx). The slow component of somatic activity was obtained by low-pass filtering the activity with the cutoff frequency of 100 Hz. The fast component was high-pass filtered (100-3 kHz). To measure the spike rate ( Figures 6 and S6 ), the highpass-filtered activity was thresholded by 3 × standard deviation. Evoked potentials were normalized by the pre-stimulus activity (−10 to 0 ms after light onset) and averaged over 50-70 measurements.
Animals were initially anesthetized by isoflurane (1% in O 2 , vol/vol, Abbott). A μPeriscope inserted to L1 and an aluminum head implant were fixed to the skull with dental cement.

Positive pressure was reduced to 30-40 mbar and the electrode advanced more slowly (1 μm per second) until a cell was encountered. Once the cell was isolated, its response to 20 ms light pulse (λ = 473 nm) from the in-pipette optical fiber was measured. If the cell showed robust, short-latency APs (see Figure S3 ), the positive pressure was released and slight suction was applied to establish a stable loose seal (10-40 MΩ). If successful, its response to light stimulation (λ = 473 nm) through the μPeriscope pointing distal apical dendrites was measured. If the cell showed either no AP or delayed, transient APs in response to the light through the pipette, the cell was not studied further and the search for another cell resumed ( Muñoz et al., 2014 49.

Electrical activity was measured using Dagan BVC-700A amplifier and was filtered at 10 kHz.
All drugs used in this study were prepared on the day of experiment, backloaded into a micropipette (Drummond) and slowly injected (at 20 nL per min, total 40-100 nl) to each target area.

Parameters such as concentration, volume, speed of injection were based on the previous studies ( Constantinople and Bruno, 2011; Guo et al., 2017; Larkum et al., 2003; Murayama et al., 2009; Polack et al., 2013 12.

The mice were anesthetized with 1% Isoflurane. Sensory stimulation ( Figures S1 A and S6 F) was provided by a single air puff given to the contralateral hindpaw or whiskers. The air puff was generated by briefly (20-50 ms) opening a valve (Takasago Electric, RP-Q1) via TTL signals.
MATLAB (Mathworks) was used for data analysis. The sample sizes are similar to those used in the field. No statistical methods were used to determine sample size. We did not exclude any animal for data analysis. Trials with different light intensities were randomly interleaved. All comparisons using Student’s t tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon tests were two-sided and each test was selected based on the data distribution histogram.
