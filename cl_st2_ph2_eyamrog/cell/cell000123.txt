Title: Hybrid Gene Origination Creates Human-Virus Chimeric Proteins during Infection


Abstract: Summary

RNA viruses are a major human health threat. The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, because viral polymerases cleave 5′-m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis (“cap-snatching”). We hypothesized that start codons within cap-snatched host transcripts could generate chimeric human-viral mRNAs with coding potential. We report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination, which we named “start-snatching.” Depending on the reading frame, start-snatching allows the translation of host and viral “untranslated regions” (UTRs) to create N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting. We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, generate T cell responses, and contribute to virulence. Our results indicate that during infection with IAV, and likely a multitude of other human, animal and plant viruses, a host-dependent mechanism allows the genesis of hybrid genes.

Section: Introduction

In eukaryotes, ribosomes typically recognize mRNAs with a terminal 5′ cap structure followed by an untranslated region (UTR), which can be tens to hundreds of nucleotides in length ( Decroly et al., 2011; Kochetov et al., 2008; Leppek et al., 2018 12.

However, a growing body of work has shown that translation can initiate in the 5′ UTRs of a large proportion of eukaryotic mRNAs, sometimes extremely close to the 5′ cap, resulting in upstream open reading frames (uORFs) ( Andreev et al., 2015; Calvo et al., 2009; Dikstein, 2012; Elfakess and Dikstein, 2008; Haimov et al., 2017; Johnstone et al., 2016; Kochetov et al., 2008; Young and Wek, 2016 2.

A large subphylum of RNA viruses, the segmented negative strand RNA viruses (sNSVs), makes direct use of the 5′ termini of host mRNAs when transcribing their own genes. The sNSVs include the families Arenaviridae , Peribunyaviridae , and Orthomyxoviridae. Highly contagious human and animal viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus (LASV) belong to these families and are responsible for significant levels of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In sNSVs, viral mRNA synthesis is primed using short 5′ methyl-7-guanosine (m 7 G) capped RNA sequences, which the viral polymerase cleaves from host RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcripts in a process known as “cap-snatching” ( Dias et al., 2009; Plotch et al., 1981; Reich et al., 2014; Rialdi et al., 2017 13.

Cap-snatching creates viral transcripts that are genetic hybrids of host and viral sequences, with the host-derived 5′ sequences being highly diverse ( Gu et al., 2015; Koppstein et al., 2015; Rialdi et al., 2017; Sikora et al., 2017 25.

Once made, viral mRNAs are translated by the host machinery.
In this manuscript, we hypothesized that by appropriating 5′ terminal mRNA sequences from their hosts, sNSVs could obtain functional upstream start codons (uAUGs), a mechanism we termed “start-snatching.” Translation from host-derived upstream start codons in chimeric host-viral transcripts would access upstream viral ORFs (uvORFs). Depending on the frame of the uAUG relative to that of the canonical viral protein, two novel chimeric types of protein in infected cells could be generated: canonical viral proteins with host and viral UTR-derived N-terminal extensions, and previously uncharacterized proteins read from ORFs that are out-of-frame with, and overprinted on, canonical viral ORFs. Below, we report on how we tested this hypothesis using genomics, cell biology, virology, and phylogenetic analyses.

Section: Results

IAV gene transcription is initiated by cap-snatching from a host mRNA ( Figure 1 A). This process generates an IAV mRNA with a 5′ end portion derived from the host. This mechanism is used to express viral genes that encode canonical viral proteins ( Figure 1 B, OUTCOME 1). We hypothesized that AUGs within host sequences could generate upstream host-virus chimeric ORFs with coding potential. Depending on the reading frame, a host-derived uAUG might initiate the synthesis of two novel chimeric genes encoding for an N-terminally extended viral protein ( Figure 1 B, OUTCOME 2, upper panel) or alternatively, an entirely novel protein overprinted on the canonical viral ORF ( Figure 1 B, OUTCOME 2, lower panel). These outcomes are contingent on two assumptions: (1) uAUGs are present in cap-snatched host sequences and can enable translation initiation, and (2) the 5′ mRNA transcribed from the viral UTR should lack stop codons. Furthermore, the absence of stop codons interrupting UTRs or the downstream ORFs should be evolutionarily conserved.
To address the first point, we determined the abundance of uAUGs in cap-snatched host sequences archived in a Decap and 5′ end sequencing (DEFEND-seq) dataset ( Rialdi et al., 2017 58. Rialdi, A. ∙ Hultquist, J. ∙ Jimenez-Morales, D. ... The RNA Exosome Syncs IAV-RNAPII Transcription to Promote Viral Ribogenesis and Infectivity Cell. 2017; 169 :679-692 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) that we had previously generated from A549 cells infected with the IAV A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) (PR8) ( Figure 1 C). AUG-containing, host-derived capped sequences ( Figure 1 C, red bars) ranged from 7–20 nt, with a median length of 11 nt, similar to the distribution obtained for all cap-snatched sequences ( Figure 1 C, gray bars). Host-derived oligonucleotides with AUG codons were present at similar ratios in all eight genome segments of the virus and were present in all three reading frames, constituting ∼12% of all cap-snatched sequences ( Figures 1 D and S1 A). Similar results were also obtained when we performed cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) on primary human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with a different strain of IAV (A/Udorn/72(H3N2); Udorn) ( Figure S1 B; Table S1 ). These results indicate that, upon infection, neither the virus nor the host cells appear to prevent the formation of chimeric RNAs with hybrid coding potential.
We next performed a bioinformatic analysis to determine if stop codons were absent from IAV sequences within the 5′ UTRs and, if so, whether this was evolutionarily conserved across IAV strains. First, we analyzed the nucleotide sequence variability of the 5′ UTRs of all eight segments, using all IAV H1N1 strains available from the NCBI Influenza Virus database ( Zhang et al., 2017 85. Zhang, Y. ∙ Aevermann, B.D. ∙ Anderson, T.K. ... Influenza Research Database: An integrated bioinformatics resource for influenza virus research Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D466-D474 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5′ UTRs of each individual segment are highly conserved within each individual segment, as shown by the positional weight matrices ( Figure S2 , top panels) and sequence alignment ( Figure S2 , lower panels). We then translated the 5′ UTR of each genome segment in silico in all possible frames ( Figure 2 A, upper panels) This revealed that the 5′ UTR of every IAV genome segment can maintain a reading frame in at least one frame ( Figure 2 A, upper panels, stop codons indicated by red boxes).
We found that the 5′ UTRs of five out of the eight genome segments (PB2, HA, NP, NA, and NS) lacked upstream stop codons in-frame with the major ORF ( Figure 2 A, upper panels, major ORF start codons indicated by green boxes). These segments thus have the potential to code for N-terminally extended viral proteins. Stop codons were also absent from the 5′ UTRs of six of the eight genome segments when these were read out of frame with the major ORF ( Figure 2 A; segments PB2, PB1, PA, NA, M, and HA). This suggested the intriguing possibility that, in the presence of a host-donated start codon, these genome segments could make novel genes encoding hybrid polypeptides.
To probe the length of uvORFs, we translated viral sequences that had cap-snatched uAUGs in our dataset in silico. The result of these analyses ( Figure 2 A, lower panels) indicated the general propensity to create chimeric ORFs, with half of the viral genome segments predicted to make sizable products (>30 aa) ( Figure 2 B). These ORFs overlap with canonical viral genes but are read in different frames (overprinted). They range from over 40 residues (HA) to nearly 80 residues (PB1). Where N-terminal extensions of the major ORF were possible, these ranged from ∼8–21 aa in length ( Figure 2 B).
Thus, uvORFs are present in all genome segments and, if licensed by host-derived uAUG-containing RNAs, could generate polypeptides of varying length ( Figure 2 B).
If cap-snatched host uAUGs did initiate translation of viral 5′ UTRs, the 5′ termini of viral mRNAs would be bound by initiating ribosomes. We therefore performed ribosomal profiling of IAV infected cells, in the presence of harringtonine, which blocks elongation of de novo assembled 80S initiation complexes but not of those already engaged in elongation. Ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) were mapped to both the human and viral genomes ( Figures 3 A and S3 A–S3C). Mapping of RPF sequences revealed an accumulation of ribosomes at the canonical initiation site in mRNAs transcribed from all eight genome segments ( Figure 3 B; main ORF AUG), consistent with previous reports ( Machkovech et al., 2019 47. Machkovech, H.M. ∙ Bloom, J.D. ∙ Subramaniam, A.R. Comprehensive profiling of translation initiation in influenza virus infected cells PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1007518 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). As well as observing ribosomes accumulating at the canonical initiation sites, we also observed RPFs mapping to the host-derived sequence upstream of the 5′ UTR, suggesting that translation initiated in this region ( Figure 3 B, insets). The total number of RPF reads mapping to host-derived sequences for each segment was 5%–20% of the reads mapping to the canonical start codon ( Figure 3 C), broadly consistent with the proportion of cap-snatched sequences containing uAUGs ( Figures 1 D and S1 B).
Precisely mapping initiation sites very close to the cap is challenging, because many of the heterogeneous 5′ mRNA ends would be too short to extrude from the ribosome, making P-site phasing problematic by standard Ribo-seq analysis. To address this, we used the location of AUGs within the RPF to identify the reading frame being translated. This suggested that initiation occurred in all three reading frames ( Figure S3 D). uAUG codons were more frequently close to the start of the viral UTR sequences, peaking at the −2 position of mRNAs from all genome segments (numbered from the first position in the coding sense of the viral genome segment), and less frequent toward the 5′ end of the host-derived sequence ( Figure S3 D). As well as inferring upstream ribosome initiation by mapping RPFs to protected uAUGs, we could test for it directly by comparing ribosomal profiles with and without harringtonine arrest. Harringtonine increased the proportion of RPFs from cap-snatched sequences that contained an AUG, indicating translation was initiating on uAUGs in these host-derived sequences ( Figure 3 D). Taken together, our data show that translation initiates from cap-snatched host-derived uAUGs in viral mRNA chimeras, albeit at lower frequencies than at canonical start codons.
To demonstrate that chimeric proteins are expressed during infection, we performed mass spectrometry analyses of cell lysates from infected cells. We also checked whether any chimeric proteins could be integrated into viral progeny by analyzing purified virions ( Figures 4 A, S4 A, and S4B).
There are limitations to this approach, as the likelihood of a tryptic digest generating peptides that can be detected by the mass spectrometer is lower for short proteins. This issue reduces the chance of finding peptides derived from small overprinted uvORFs (<30 aa), or that map to short N-terminal extensions. Nevertheless, we were able to identify at least 2 distinct peptides that were derived from the two long overprinted uvORFs in the PB1 and PB2 segments, which we named PB1-UFO and PB2-UFO, respectively (for “Upstream Frankenstein ORF”). In addition, we detected a UTR-encoded N-terminal extension of NP, which we named NP-extension (NP-ext) ( Figures 4 A, 4B, S4 A, and S4B; Table S2 A). Peptides from all three proteins were present in PR8 IAV infected cell lysates ( Figures 4 B, left panels, and S4 A; Table S2 A). These novel viral peptides were not detected in uninfected controls ( Figure S4 A). We were also able to identify peptides derived from the PB1-UFO protein when we re-analyzed three previously published proteomic datasets of IAV infection ( Heaton et al., 2016 27. Heaton, N.S. ∙ Moshkina, N. ∙ Fenouil, R. ... Targeting Viral Proteostasis Limits Influenza Virus, HIV, and Dengue Virus Infection Immunity. 2016; 44 :46-58 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 C; Table S2 C). Only NP-ext was detected in virions ( Figure S4 B; Table S2 B), presumably because influenza virions specifically package hundreds of copies of NP, while there is no known mechanism to specifically package other uvORF-encoded proteins ( Hutchinson et al., 2014 33. Hutchinson, E.C. ∙ Charles, P.D. ∙ Hester, S.S. ... Conserved and host-specific features of influenza virion architecture Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4816 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Quantification of the PB1-UFO, PB2-UFO, and NP-ext proteins indicated that, although they are less abundant than the major viral proteins, they are expressed at detectable levels within an infected cell. When quantified, tryptic peptides from these proteins were found between the 20 th and 40 th percentile of normalized peptide intensities, including both host and viral proteins, within our samples ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Taken together, our data show that N-terminal extensions and overprinted uvORFs are synthesized during IAV infection and are present at a moderate abundance within infected cells.
We next asked whether chimeric host-viral proteins could be recognized by the host’s immune system. To test this, we created modified IAVs containing insertions of a class I-restricted epitope of ovalbumin ( Porgador et al., 1997 53. Porgador, A. ∙ Yewdell, J.W. ∙ Deng, Y. ... Localization, quantitation, and in situ detection of specific peptide-MHC class I complexes using a monoclonal antibody Immunity. 1997; 6 :715-726 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (602) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the uvORFs predicted from our in silico analyses, we inserted the epitope (OVAI; OVA 257-264; SL8; SIINFEKL) in frame with the longest uvORF (PB1 frame 3 uvORF; PB1-UFO(SIIN) ( Figure 4 C) and one of the shortest uvORFs (NS, frame 2 uvORF; NS-UFO(SIIN) ( Figure 4 D). In the case of PB1 segment, we integrated sequences encoding OVAI directly into the UTR, placing the epitope within the uvORF encoding PB1-UFO ( Figure 4 C, top panels). For the NS segment, we used synonymous mutations in the canonical viral gene to delete five naturally occurring stop codons in the uvORF; we then inserted OVAI into the extended uvORF, positioning the insertion in a flexible “linker” region of the major viral gene NS1 ( Thulasi Raman and Zhou, 2016 71. Thulasi Raman, S.N. ∙ Zhou, Y. Networks of Host Factors that Interact with NS1 Protein of Influenza A Virus Front. Microbiol. 2016; 7 :654 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). This genetic configuration was chosen to ascertain whether uvORFs are translated by default provided that they are not interrupted by stop codons ( Figure 4 D, top panels).
Mouse DC2.4 cells infected with PB1-UFO(SIIN) activated transgenic OT-I CD8 + T cells (that are highly specific for mouse H-2 K b class I molecule complexed with SIINFEKL; Kb-SIIN) ( Hogquist et al., 1994 29. Hogquist, K.A. ∙ Jameson, S.C. ∙ Heath, W.R. ... T cell receptor antagonist peptides induce positive selection Cell. 1994; 76 :17-27 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2380) PubMed Google Scholar ) as determined by upregulation of CD25 and CD69 ( Figure 4 C, lower panels). Recombinant IAV expressing SIIN(PB1-Ub-SIIN) at high levels ( Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Kishton, R.J. ∙ Angel, M. ... Ribosomal Proteins Regulate MHC Class I Peptide Generation for Immunosurveillance Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :1162-1173 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used as a positive control ( Figure 4 C, right panels). No upregulation of CD25 and CD69 was observed in mock treated samples. Similar results were obtained with the NS-UFO(SIIN) virus. Here, OT-I CD8 + T cells were activated when incubated with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) infected with the NS-UFO(SIIN) virus ( Figure 4 D, right panels). This was comparable to the activation seen in a control experiment using a virus in which OVAI was inserted into the stem of the viral NA protein (NA-SIIN) ( Figure 4 D, middle panels) ( Bottermann et al., 2018 4. Bottermann, M. ∙ Foss, S. ∙ van Tienen, L.M. ... TRIM21 mediates antibody inhibition of adenovirus-based gene delivery and vaccination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :10440-10445 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Again, noo upregulation was observed during mock infection. Taken together, our data with both the PB1-UFO(SIIN) and the NS-SIIN viruses indicate that, unless blocked by stop codons, uvORFs are translated and expressed during infection, and T cell immunosurveillance extends to peptides encoded by uvORFs.
Next, to probe if the expression of chimeric host-viral proteins has an impact on viral pathogenesis, we generated a battery of recombinant viruses, in which specific N-terminal extensions or uvORFs were knocked out through the introduction of premature stop codons (NP-Δext and UFO Δ , respectively). The viruses were generated either in the PR8 ( Figures 4 E, 4F, and S4 D), A/WSN/33(H1N1) (WSN) ( Figure S4 E), or mouse-adapted A/California/04/2009(H1N1) (Cal09) ( Figure S4 F) backgrounds. We also generated the reciprocal control viruses carrying synonymous mutations (NP SYN ;UFO SYN ). Both genomic configurations of control and knockout viruses maintained intact the canonical viral ORFs ( Table S3 ).
The mutant viruses did not display gross alterations in viral growth in vitro ( Figures S4 D–S4F). This was independent of viral background and also of the cell type infected ( Figures S4 D–S4F). To determine if interrupting upstream translation had effects in vivo , we focused on the NP-Δext and PB1-UFO Δ viruses in the PR8 background. The strategy used to generate these viruses is shown in the top panels of Figures 4 E and 4F.
We found that the NP-Δext viruses were less virulent in mice compared to the control NP-SYN viruses ( Figure 4 E), suggesting that NP-ext expression contributes to virulence. A similar role for NP-ext was recently proposed for the pandemic 2019 IAV (pdm2009) strain, in which an extended NP protein was found to contribute to virulence in mice and pigs ( Wise et al., 2019 81. Wise, H.M. ∙ Gaunt, E. ∙ Ping, J. ... An alternative AUG codon that produces an N-terminally extended form of the influenza A virus NP is a virulence factor for a swine-derived virus bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Importantly, however, pdm2009 viruses translate NP-ext from a uAUG encoded in the 5′ UTR of NP, but no corresponding uAUG is encoded by the PR8 virus used in our study.
The PB1-UFO Δ viruses displayed increased virulence when compared to the PB1-UFO SYN viruses in vivo , although in this case an effect was only observed at high infectious doses ( Figure 4 F). Gene expression analyses suggested that there were distinct transcriptomic signatures in the lungs of mice infected with high doses of the PB1-UFO Δ or PB1-UFO SYN viruses ( Figures S4 G and S4H; Table S4 A). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated changes in a number of pathways, including leukocyte activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion ( Figure S4 I; Table S5 ). Immune cell dysregulation may therefore be at least partially responsible for the differences in morbidity and mortality during infection with the PB1-UFO Δ or PB1-UFO SYN viruses.
Together, these functional data show that uvORFs are expressed during IAV infections, can be detected by the adaptive immune system, and can modulate the severity of infection.
We next asked if NP-ext and PB1-UFO are conserved across different strains. The ability to express NP-ext without interruption by stop codons in the 5′ UTR was maintained in 99.9% of IAV isolates present in the NCBI Influenza database ( Zhang et al., 2017 85. Zhang, Y. ∙ Aevermann, B.D. ∙ Anderson, T.K. ... Influenza Research Database: An integrated bioinformatics resource for influenza virus research Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D466-D474 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2, S5 A, and S5B). Sequence analysis of the translated 5′ UTR also suggested that N-terminally extended sequences would be similar within IAV subtypes ( Figure S5 C). There are many reasons why these sequences are conserved, including constraints imposed by RNA structure and the requirement to interact with the viral polymerase complex ( Fodor, 2013 19. Fodor, E. The RNA polymerase of influenza a virus: mechanisms of viral transcription and replication Acta Virol. 2013; 57 :113-122 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whatever the primary selective pressure, the result of the conservation of the 5′ UTR sequence is that the ability to express NP-ext is nearly universal among IAV strains.
The ability to express PB1-UFO requires not only a lack of stop codons in the appropriate frame of the 5′ UTR, but also the maintenance of a uvORF overprinted on the canonical PB1 ORF. We first analyzed sequences of the IAV subtypes H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1. We found that PB1-UFO is conserved within each of these three virus subtypes ( Figure 5 A), and stop codons resulting in PB1-UFO proteins <77 aa long were infrequent ( Figure 5 B).
To understand the factors that contribute to the maintenance of PB1-UFO ORF length and amino acid sequence composition within the IAV, we first looked at the probability that an ORF similar in length to PB1-UFO could have arisen stochastically in the IAV PB1 segment. We used a sequence randomization model ( Figure S5 D) on the H3N2 subtype of IAV, the subtype for which the greatest number of complete sequences were available. We found that ∼77% of the sequences in the NCBI Influenza database ( Zhang et al., 2017 85. Zhang, Y. ∙ Aevermann, B.D. ∙ Anderson, T.K. ... Influenza Research Database: An integrated bioinformatics resource for influenza virus research Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D466-D474 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ) encoded a 77-aa PB1-UFO ( Figure S5 E) that is significantly longer than the ∼15–30 aa long ORFs expected by chance ( Figures S5 E–S5G). We also found that these predicted ORFs would require multiple (30–70) additional synonymous mutations in order to generate an ORF that is of similar length to PB1-UFO ( Figure S5 H).
The above analysis does not take into account constraints imposed by nucleotide biases in the viral UTR or canonical PB1 ORF or from viral RNA structure. To examine their roles in the maintenance of the PB1-UFO ORF we used the frequency propagator method ( Luksza and Lässig, 2014; Strelkowa and Lässig, 2012 46. Luksza, M. ∙ Lässig, M. A predictive fitness model for influenza Nature. 2014; 507 :57-61 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Strelkowa, N. ∙ Lässig, M. Clonal interference in the evolution of influenza Genetics. 2012; 192 :671-682 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 C and S6 A). This method can determine if these factors imposed constraints on the PB1-UFO amino acid sequence. The model and its possible outcomes are shown and discussed in detail in Figures 5 C and S6 A and the STAR Methods .
Briefly, mutations that occur in the viral UTR region, which encodes the N-terminal part of PB1-UFO, undergo negative selection ( Figure 5 D; g < 1). This indicates that mutations in the viral UTR, should they occur, have a low probability of being propagated down the IAV strain tree. On the other hand, when we consider the nucleotide sequences that encode the overlapping regions of PB1-UFO and the canonical PB1 ORF, we see that there is heterogeneous/neutral selection occurring on mutations in the PB1-UFO ORF ( g ≈ 1). This is most likely shaped by the requirement to maintain the main PB1 ORF sequence, as mutations that maintain the PB1 ORF aa sequence (synonymous mutations in PB1 ORF) are more likely to be fixed in the population ( Figure 5 E; red line; g < 1). Mutations that change the PB1 amino acid sequence instead undergo negative selection ( Figure 5 F; blue line; g < 1) and are unlikely to be propagated down the strain tree, consistent with PB1 ORF being fixed and essential for IAV.
Selection in these regions is unlikely to be dominated by RNA structural constraints because similar effects are observed when RNA secondary structure is taken into account for our analysis ( Figures S6 B–S6D). Overall, our analyses suggest that PB1-UFO conservation is largely dictated by the need to preserve both the viral UTR nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence of the main PB1 ORF. Taken together, this suggests that the evolution of the PB1-UFO ORF is heavily constrained by converging selective pressures.
Because we had shown that peptides derived from PB1-UFO could be presented to the immune system ( Figures 4 C and 4D), we asked whether epitope-HLA class I interactions could play a role in shaping PB1-UFO sequence. We found that multiple unique PB1-UFO peptides were predicted to bind to and interact with various HLA types ( Figure 5 G; Table S6 ). Notably, high-affinity (<500 nM) HLA-epitope pairs were concentrated in regions of PB1-UFO where conservation was low, suggesting that immune pressure on PB1-UFO may lead to some diversifying selection on the protein ( Figure 5 H).
Finally, we asked whether our finding that start-snatching generates novel ORFs could be generalized from IAV to other sNSVs. We began by looking at another member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, influenza B virus (IBV), by performing DEFEND-seq on A549 cells infected with IBV. The host-derived sequences that IBV obtains by cap-snatching had comparable median lengths to those appropriated by IAV ( Figure S7 A). Sequence analysis indicates that uAUG-initiated translation could read through the 5′ UTR of every IBV genome segment in at least one frame and predicted at least two long overprinted new ORFs (PA and NA segments) ( Figures 6 A and 6B), as well as N-terminal extensions of six of the eight major viral proteins ( Figures 6 A and S7 B).
Next, we looked at other families of sNSVs. We performed CAGE analysis on cells infected by Lassa virus (LASV), a member of the family Arenaviridae and an emerging virus that in the past decade has caused several epidemics of hemorrhagic fever. LASV genomes comprise two ambisense segments. The median cap-snatched length of LASV mRNAs was seven nucleotides ( Figure S7 C) in agreement with structural prediction of the LASV polymerase ( Wallat et al., 2014 74. Wallat, G.D. ∙ Huang, Q. ∙ Wang, W. ... High-resolution structure of the N-terminal endonuclease domain of the Lassa virus L polymerase in complex with magnesium ions PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e87577 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequence analysis indicates that these uAUGs could lead to the translation of N-terminal extensions of the GPC protein, as well as the formation of two overprinted new ORFs of ∼50 and 80 aa from the viral mRNAs encoding the nucleoprotein (N) and Z proteins of LASV ( Figure 6 C, 6D, and S7 D). The proportions of uAUGs detected in cap-snatched sequences from IBV and LASV were dependent on viral segments and ranged between 4% and 12% ( Table S7 ).
We also tested the hypothesis that translation of UTR-derived sequences could occur in other sNSVs by using minireplicon assays encoding a luciferase reporter to a member of the Phenuiviridae (Heartland banyangvirus; L segment UTRs). By mutating the canonical AUG, we identified low but readily detectable levels of upstream translation ( Figure S7 E).
Overall, these data suggest that generation of chimeric virus-host ORFs is a common feature of sNSVs. To quantify the potential pervasiveness of this mechanism and the likelihood of novel ORFs being conserved and functionalized into new genes, we analyzed RNA virus genomic sequences for their propensity to generate novel proteins by performing in silico analyses of their genomes. Although the exact levels of upstream translation will depend on a range of factors, including the intrinsic properties of viral polymerase complexes and, potentially, mechanisms that modulate upstream AUG translation, our results indicate the genomic potential of start-snatching ( Figure 7 ). Given that viral mRNA and proteins are among the most highly expressed biotypes in infected cells, our data support the idea that all cap-snatching virus could expand their proteome by start-snatching uAUGs from their hosts.

Section: Discussion

In this manuscript, we describe the existence of a mechanism employed by sNSVs to generate chimeric host-virus genes. This mechanism, “start-snatching,” involves the co-opting of start codons from host mRNA sequences to expand the viral proteome. This mechanism appears to be accessible to all sNSVs, including major human pathogens such as IAV and LASV. Start-snatching allows the translation of proteins from cryptic uvORFs, either as canonical viral proteins with N-terminal extensions, or as UFO proteins overprinted on the canonical viral ORF. In this study, we have identified examples of both types of uvORF in IAV infections. We have shown that translation can initiate on uAUGs in the host-derived sequence of viral mRNAs, and that this leads to the expression of chimeric host-virus proteins that can be detected in infected cells. In our hands, the ablation of uvORFs did not impact viral replication in vitro but had a moderate effect in vivo , which would be consistent with uvORFs encoding accessory proteins. We found that uvORFs can be recognized by the immune system, and we modeled the contribution of different evolutionary forces at play on uvORFs by characterizing viral-intrinsic and host-immune features that contribute to their evolution. Finally, we showed experimentally and by sequence analysis that the capability to express uvORFs through start-snatching is widespread among the sNSVs.
We hypothesized that cap-snatching of sNSVs could generate ORFs that are encoded by two genomes (human and virus). Consistent with this, our analyses indicate that roughly 10% of IAV mRNA contains host-derived uAUGs ( Figures 1 D and S1 B). Furthermore, uvORFs are translated in at least three of the eight IAV genome segments, generating NP-ext, PB2-UFO, and PB1-UFO ( Figures 2 and 4 ). Genetic evidence suggested that many other uvORF proteins are also likely to be expressed, although we did not detect them in our current study, potentially due to the substantial sequence overlap of N-terminal extensions with canonical viral proteins and the short lengths of many overprinted ORFs. Overall, our analysis indicates that multiple families of viruses can generate chimeric RNAs and could produce proteins via this mechanism ( Figures 6 and 7 ).
Our analysis shows that most sNSV infections lead to expression of chimeric genes and uvORFs. Because they are host and virally encoded, it is therefore reasonable to ask who benefits from their expression. Key considerations in this regard, and based on our analysis are: (1) Epitopes encoded in uvORFs are recognized by the adaptive immune system. MHC I presentation of uvORF-derived peptides poses the risk of an adaptive immune response against cells infected with sNSVs, analogous to the risks posed to IAV by the presentation of alternative reading frames (ARFs) and defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) ( Dolan et al., 2010; Wei et al., 2019; Wei and Yewdell, 2017, 2019; Zanker et al., 2019 16.

Immunol. 2019; 202 :3370-3380 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, the risks posed to the virus by the presentation of uvORFs are potentially even higher due to the high conservation of these sequences. (2) Two uvORFs considered here (NP-ext and PB1-UFO) are both highly conserved across multiple strains of IAV. However, merely assessing conservation is insufficient, as other forms of selection also act on IAV genome sequences. In particular, genome packaging signals in the primary RNA sequence are concentrated in the terminal regions of each genome segment ( Dadonaite et al., 2019; Gog et al., 2007; Hutchinson et al., 2010 10. Dadonaite, B. ∙ Gilbertson, B. ∙ Knight, M.L. ... The structure of the influenza A virus genome Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1781-1789 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar 23.

Gog, J.R. ∙ Afonso, Edos.S. ∙ Dalton, R.M. ... Codon conservation in the influenza A virus genome defines RNA packaging signals Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :1897-1907 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar 34.

An overlapping protein-coding region in influenza A virus segment 3 modulates the host response Science. 2012; 337 :199-204 Crossref Scopus (488) PubMed Google Scholar ). In overprinted regions, like PB1-UFO, there is also selective pressure conferred by the sequence encoding the canonical ORF. We observe both of these effects ( Figures 5 D–5F). Despite this, we also observe that (1) nonsense mutations do not occur frequently in the population ( Figures S5 D–S5H), and (2) missense mutations that do eventually accumulate in the PB1-UFO ORF tend to be those that change potentially immunogenic epitopes ( Figures 5 G and 5H).
This information, and the mere fact that full-length PB1-UFO is present in more than 75% of all IAV isolates and NP extensions are present in more than 99% of IAV isolates, suggests that multiple forces at the host-virus interface drive the virus to maintain the full-length proteins in their sequences. The relative contributions of distinct evolutionary forces in maintaining these proteins are not yet clear.
An important point to be made about uvORFs is that conservation and/or expression does not equate to functionality. While some uvORFs might have gained functions, we predict others will exist as afunctional, evolutionary spandrels. Such uvORFs are stuck in a place where they have to be made but suffer too many external constraints to productively sample evolutionary space for functionalization. All things considered, we can fairly surmise that any cost the virus might incur through uvORFs being made is outweighed by the fitness benefits of maintaining a genetic architecture that allows for their expression. The awareness of uvORF existence, and their pervasiveness in the viral world, is thus critical for our understanding of viral biology, viral evolution, and host immune surveillance.
Genetic overprinting typically occurs when a pre-existing reading frame acquires mutations that enable translation in alternative reading frames while maintaining the function of the ancestral frame. This is an important mechanism for the creation of new proteins, especially in the context of compact genomes (viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic organelles) with little coding capacity ( Keese and Gibbs, 1992; Kovacs et al., 2010; Poulin et al., 2003; Sabath et al., 2012 37.

Sabath, N. ∙ Wagner, A. ∙ Karlin, D. Evolution of viral proteins originated de novo by overprinting Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29 :3767-3780 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ).
While genetic overprinting could be selectively advantageous for some organisms, the evolution of overprinted genes is problematic. Any evolution of the overprinted ORF will be constrained by the effects of mutations in the underlying ORF. In addition, established overlapping ORFs typically have dedicated mechanisms for their expression, such as ribosomal scanning or frameshifting, which allow for efficient and regulated expression patterns. Exploring the limited evolutionary space that satisfies all of these constraints presumably requires the overprinted gene to provide a strong selective advantage.
Start-snatching exposes the 5′ coding regions of sNSV genomes to low levels of non-specific out-of-frame translation. This “genetic feature” could facilitate the evolution of novel genes through genetic overprinting, without having to evolve a dedicated method to express an overprinted ORF before that ORF could provide a selective advantage.
A similar argument applies to the evolution of alternative upstream translation mechanisms for N-terminally extended proteins: if an N-terminal extension provided by start-snatching was selectively advantageous, the virus could evolve to directly encode an uAUG in the UTR and make the generation of extended protein host-independent and heritable. In this respect, it is interesting to note that some recent strains of IAV have evolved to encode a uAUG in the UTR of NP that allows it to express an N-terminally extended protein that can modulate virulence ( Wise et al., 2019 81. Wise, H.M. ∙ Gaunt, E. ∙ Ping, J. ... An alternative AUG codon that produces an N-terminally extended form of the influenza A virus NP is a virulence factor for a swine-derived virus bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). In essence, start-snatching might simply be a way to increase the chances of UTR translation by outsourcing uAUG to non-viral genomic material.
The translation of 5′ UTRs (that implies their misnaming) occurs frequently in eukaryotic genes. uORFs are, in fact, pervasively expressed, with some functioning as short biologically active polypeptides ( Andrews and Rothnagel, 2014; Calvo et al., 2009; Combier et al., 2008; Sendoel et al., 2017; Starck et al., 2016; Wang and Rothnagel, 2004; Wen et al., 2009 3.

Starck, S.R. ∙ Tsai, J.C. ∙ Chen, K. ... Translation from the 5′ untranslated region shapes the integrated stress response Science. 2016; 351 :aad3867 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, future work will be needed to redefine what, in reality, a gene is.
The capacity of a pathogen to overcome host barriers and establish infection is based on the expression of pathogen-derived proteins. To understand how a pathogen antagonizes the host and establishes infection we need to have a clear understanding of what proteins a pathogen encodes, how they function, and the manner in which they contribute to virulence. The current dogma about many life-threatening pathogens is that they encode a small repertoire of proteins because of their limited genome size. RNA viruses, such as IAV, are a prime example of this. Here, we have shown that IAV, IBV, LASV, and likely most, if not all, other sNSVs, can use host RNA to expand their genetic repertoire. Similar to novel human genes which originated from other mechanisms and contributed to organismal evolution ( Kaessmann, 2010; Ohno, 1970 36. Kaessmann, H. Origins, evolution, and phenotypic impact of new genes Genome Res. 2010; 20 :1313-1326 Crossref Scopus (561) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Ohno, S. Evolution by Gene Duplication Springer, 1970 Crossref Google Scholar ), we expect chimeric genes to shape (and have shaped) host-virus relationships.

Plasmids used for reverse genetics were the PR8 pDUAL plasmids ( de Wit et al., 2004 11. de Wit, E. ∙ Spronken, M.I. ∙ Bestebroer, T.M. ... Efficient generation and growth of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 from eight cDNA fragments Virus Res. 2004; 103 :155-161 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the Cal09 pDP2002 plasmids ( Ye et al., 2010 82. Ye, J. ∙ Sorrell, E.M. ∙ Cai, Y. ... Variations in the hemagglutinin of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus: potential for strains with altered virulence phenotype? PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6 :e1001145 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) (a kind gift of Prof Daniel R. Perez (University of Georgia, USA). Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids was performed using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (QIAGEN); the edited NS segment sequence required for the PR8-NS.F3.SIIN mutant virus (described in Figure 4 ) was synthesized by Genewiz.
OVA257-264 (SIINFEKL) epitope was inserted into the 5′UTR of the PB1 segment of the influenza A virus (IAV) genome at position 1 before the PB1 start codon. This insertion did not result in an N-terminal extension of or mutations in the PB1 protein, but results in the insertion of the OVA257-264 antigenic epitope in frame with the PB1-UFO protein.
The OVA257-264 (SIINFEKL) epitope was inserted into frame 2 of the NS segment of the IAV genome, in a region corresponding to the linker sequence of the NS1 protein (encoded in frame). This effectively replaced codons 79-84 of NS1, while retaining the sequence of NEP. The replacement sequence was flanked by two upstream nucleotides and one downstream nucleotide to introduce a frameshift into frame 2. Premature stop codons in frame 2 were also mutated at positions −4, 27, 32, 74 and 77, relative from the start codon of NS1, to generate a 106 amino acid long NS-UFO sequence, extending it from the original 4 amino acid long uvORF in reading frame 2.

PR8; PB1-UFO Δ contains a C to T nucleotide substitution 9 nucleotides after the start of PB1 open reading frame. This generates a premature stop codon in the PB1-UFO ORF. Its control virus, PR8; PB1-UFO SYN , contains a C to G nucleotide substitution at the same position. Both viruses retain the amino acid sequence of the PB1 ORF. PR8; PB1-EXT+ contains a T to C nucleotide substitution three nucleotides before the start of PB1 open reading frame. This disrupts a conserved stop codon (“TGA”) in frame with PB1 ORF, resulting in the N-terminal extension of the PB1-ORF. PB1-UFO ORF is maintained in this virus. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing both plasmids and viruses. All viruses were expanded in 9-11 day old embryonated chicken eggs after rescue. The stock virus titers were calculated from the average of three independent experiments.
PR8; NP-EXT Δ contains an A to T nucleotide substitution 6 nucleotides before the start of the NP open reading frame. This generates an in-frame stop codon that results in the loss of the N-terminal NP-extension. Its control virus, PR8; NP-EXT SYN , bears an A to G nucleotide substitution at the same position in the UTR, preserving the NP-extension. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing both plasmids and viruses, and 3 independent plaque purified clones of each virus, grown on MDCK cells, were used in subsequent experiments. Stock virus titers were calculated from the average of three independent experiments.
WSN; PB1-UFO Δ and Cal09; PB1-UFO Δ viruses contain C to U nucleotide substitutions 9 nucleotides after the start of PB1 open reading frame. This generates a premature stop codon in the PB1-UFO ORF. Their control viruses, WSN ; PB1-UFO SYN and Cal09; PB1-UFO SYN respectively, contain C to G nucleotide substitutions at the same positions. All the viruses retain the amino acid sequence of the PB1 ORF.
WSN; PB2-UFO Δ and Cal09; PB2-UFO Δ viruses contain A to T nucleotide substitutions 12 nucleotides after the start of PB2 open reading frame. This generates a premature stop codon in the PB2-UFO ORF. Their control viruses, WSN; PB2-UFO SYN and Cal09; PB2-UFO SYN respectively, contain a A to C nucleotide substitutions at the same position. All the viruses retain the amino acid sequence of the PB2 ORF.
WSN; PA-UFO Δ and Cal09; PA-UFO Δ viruses contain C to T nucleotide substitutions 42 nucleotides after the start of PA open reading frame. This generates a premature stop codon in the PA-UFO ORF. Their control viruses, WSN; PA-UFO SYN and Cal09; PA-UFO SYN respectively, contain C to A nucleotide substitutions at the same position. All the viruses retain the amino acid sequence of the PA ORF.
WSN; HA-UFO Δ viruses contain A to T nucleotide substitutions 45 nucleotides after the start of HA open reading frame. This generates a premature stop codon in the HA-UFO ORF. Their control viruses, WSN ; HA-UFO SYN and Cal09; PA-UFO SYN respectively, contain A to C nucleotide substitutions at the same position. All the viruses retain the amino acid sequence of the HA ORF.
Cal09; HA-UFO Δ viruses contain G to T nucleotide substitutions 52 nucleotides after the start of HA open reading frame. This generates a premature stop codon in the HA-UFO ORF. Its control virus, Cal09; HA-UFO SYN contains an G to C nucleotide substitution at the same position. All the viruses retain the amino acid sequence of the HA ORF.

A549 or MDCK cells were infected with the indicated viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and incubated for one hour at 37°C. Infected cells were washed twice, and then cultured with Opti-MEM and TPCK-treated trypsin at 37°C for 72 h. Supernatants were collected at the indicated time points. Viral titers were determined by plaque assays.
Plaque assay in MDCK cells were performed as described previously ( Gaush and Smith, 1968 22. Gaush, C.R. ∙ Smith, T.F. Replication and plaque assay of influenza virus in an established line of canine kidney cells Appl. Microbiol. 1968; 16 :588-594 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, serially diluted culture supernatants of infected cells were adsorbed on layers of confluent MDCK cells for 1 hour. Infected cells were then overlaid with 2ml of DMEM, 25mM HEPES, 2mM glutamine, 100ug/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 1ug/ml TPCK-trypsin and 0.8% Oxoid Agar. Plates were incubated for 48-72h until plaques were observed. Plaque were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde and visualized through staining with 1% crystal violet solution. Alternatively, MDCK cells were overlaid with DMEM mixed 1:1 with 2% (w/v) low gelling temperature agarose in PBS and supplemented with 1ug/ml TPCK-trypsin, incubated for 48-72h until plaques were observed, and then either fixed and stained directly (with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R in 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid and 50% (v/v) ethanol) or fixed in 80% chilled acetone and visualized by immunocytochemistry (permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked in 10% FBS in PBS, immunostained with mouse anti-NP (BioRad: Cat# MCA400) and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz; Cat # sc-516102) and visualized with True Blue Peroxidase).
A549 cells were infected in a 10cm dish with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1, PR8) at a MOI of 3. At 8h post infection, ribosome profiling libraries were prepared as previously described ( McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017 50. McGlincy, N.J. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Transcriptome-wide measurement of translation by ribosome profiling Methods. 2017; 126 :112-129 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following exceptions. Infected cells were treated with either DMSO or 5μg/mL harringtonine for 15 minutes. Cell lysis was performed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen prior to the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer. rRNA removal was performed as previously described ( Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Kishton, R.J. ∙ Angel, M. ... Ribosomal Proteins Regulate MHC Class I Peptide Generation for Immunosurveillance Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :1162-1173 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequencing was performed two lanes of a HiSeq using a 2x150 bp configuration.
A549 or HEK293T cells were infected with PR8 virus stock at multiplicities of infection of 3 and 5 respectively. At 8h or 24h post infection, cells were scraped, washed twice in PBS with protease inhibitors (Calbiochem), before being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Where indicated, MG132 was added to the cell culture media 4h prior to sample collection. Mock infected samples were included as negative controls. To prepare cell lysates for mass spectrometry, cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH8, 1% NP-40, 100mM NaCl, protease inhibitors) on ice. NaCl concentration was then brought up to 500mM by adding salt drop-wise into the solution while agitating. Lysates were rotated for 30min at 4°C before an equal volume of water was added to the sample to bring NaCl concentration back to 250mM. Samples were then centrifuged at full speed for 15 min at 4°C. 4x Laemmli buffer (200mM Tris-HCl pH6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.588M B-mercaptoethanol, 50mM EDTA and 0.08% Bromophenol Blue) was then added to the supernatant to 1x concentration, and 5μl of the lysate was loaded on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel (Novex). Gels were run under a hood for 150V for 1h15min in 1X MOPS running buffer and stained in SimplyBlue TM SafeStain (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Once stained, gel bands corresponding to 40-60kDa and < 15kDa were excised. Gel slices were subject to in-gel tryptic digests as previously described ( Rosenfeld et al., 1992 59. Rosenfeld, J. ∙ Capdevielle, J. ∙ Guillemot, J.C. ... In-gel digestion of proteins for internal sequence analysis after one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203 :173-179 Crossref Scopus (1160) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Digested samples were analyzed on a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometry system equipped with an Easy nLC 1200 ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography system interfaced via a Nanospray Flex nanoelectrospray source. Samples were injected on a C18 reverse phase column (25 cm × 75 μm packed with ReprosilPur C18 AQ 1.9 μm particles). Peptides were separated by an organic gradient from 5% to 30% ACN in 0.1% formic acid over 70 minutes at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The MS continuously acquired spectra in a data-dependent manner throughout the gradient, acquiring a full scan in the Orbitrap (at 120,000 resolution with an AGC target of 200,000 and a maximum injection time of 100 ms) followed by as many MS/MS scans as could be acquired on the most abundant ions in 3 s in the dual linear ion trap (rapid scan type with an intensity threshold of 5000, HCD collision energy of 29%, AGC target of 10,000, a maximum injection time of 35 ms, and an isolation width of 1.6 m/z). Singly and unassigned charge states were rejected. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 1, an exclusion duration of 20 s, and an exclusion mass width of ± 10 ppm. Raw mass spectrometry data were assigned to human protein sequences and MS1 intensities extracted with the MaxQuant software package (version 1.6.8) ( Cox and Mann, 2008 9. Cox, J. ∙ Mann, M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26 :1367-1372 Crossref Scopus (10524) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data were searched against the SwissProt human protein database (downloaded on October 10, 2019) and a custom influenza A virus database comprising all six open-reading frames greater than 10 amino acids for the IAV (strain PR-8) genomic sequence. Variable modifications were allowed for N-terminal protein acetylation, methionine oxidation, and lysine acetylation. A static modification was indicated for carbamidomethyl cysteine. All other settings were left using MaxQuant default settings.
The purification of influenza virions and collection of mass spectra by LC-MS/MS has been described previously ( Hutchinson et al., 2014 33. Hutchinson, E.C. ∙ Charles, P.D. ∙ Hester, S.S. ... Conserved and host-specific features of influenza virion architecture Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4816 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ), and followed previously-described protocols for purification, mass spectrometry and data analysis ( Hutchinson and Stegmann, 2018 30. Hutchinson, E.C. ∙ Stegmann, M. Purification and Proteomics of Influenza Virions Methods Mol. Biol. 2018; 1836 :89-120 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the IAV WSN was propagated on MDBK cells. Six viral stocks were prepared, of which half were subjected to haemadsorption on chicken red blood cells to stringently remove non-viral material. Virus particles were then purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, lysed in urea, reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin and LysC. Tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Dionex, Camberley, UK) run in direct injection mode and coupled to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Hemel Hempstead, UK) in ‘Top 10’ data-dependent acquisition mode. Raw files describing these mass spectra have been deposited at the Mass spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE; Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry at University of California, San Diego) and can be accessed at https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/datasets.jsp using the MassIVE ID MSV000078740. For the purposes of this project, data were re-analyzed using MaxQuant 1.5.8.3 analysis software ( Tyanova et al., 2016 73. Tyanova, S. ∙ Temu, T. ∙ Cox, J. The MaxQuant computational platform for mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :2301-2319 Crossref Scopus (2636) PubMed Google Scholar ) using standard settings and the following parameters: label-free quantitation and the iBAQ algorithm ( Schwanhäusser et al., 2011 62. Schwanhäusser, B. ∙ Busse, D. ∙ Li, N. ... Global quantification of mammalian gene expression control Nature. 2011; 473 :337-342 Crossref Scopus (4527) PubMed Google Scholar ) enabled; enzyme: trypsin/P; variable modifications: oxidation (M) and acetyl (Protein N-ter); and fixed modifications: carbamidomethyl (C); digestion mode: semi-specific free N terminus. Peptide spectra were matched to custom databases containing the IAV WSN proteome (including full-length translations of all six reading frames), an edited version of the Bos taurus proteome (UP000009136; retrieved from UniProt on 16/05/2017) in which all instances of the ubiquitin sequence had been deleted, and a single repeat of the ubiquitin protein sequence.
DEFEND-seq was performed as previously described ( Rialdi et al., 2017 58. Rialdi, A. ∙ Hultquist, J. ∙ Jimenez-Morales, D. ... The RNA Exosome Syncs IAV-RNAPII Transcription to Promote Viral Ribogenesis and Infectivity Cell. 2017; 169 :679-692 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, RNA was extracted from A549 cells infected with influenza B virus (B/Wisconsin/01/2010) for 8 hours using Trizol (Invitrogen) and subjected to DNase treatment (QIAGEN). 5μg of DNase treated RNA was then incubated with 10U of Tobacco Acid Phosphotase (Epicentre; 37°C, 1.5h) to remove mRNA 5′caps. Sodium periodate was then added (to 500mM) into the reaction to block the 3′OH. The reaction was then allowed to proceed for 1.5h at 4°C, before being blocked by the addition of 1/10 volume 1M L-lysine, and incubating for an additional 10min at room temperature. RNA was purified with 1.8X AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Barcoded with RNA adapters were then ligated to the 5′ends of RNAs overnight at 16°C. Adaptor-ligated RNA was purified using 1.8X volume of AMPure XP beads. Ribosomal RNAs were removed using the Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA synthesis was performed using a custom 3′ primer ((5′-AGA CGT GTG CTC TTC CGA TCT N ∗ N ∗ N ∗ N ∗ N ∗ N ∗ -3′, Bioo Scientific, N ∗ = randomized bases) for 2 min at 65°C. Illumina adapters were added by PCR, and products were size-selected (200-400bp) using BluePippin 2% M1 gels (Sage Scientific). The library was validated on the Agilent Bioanalyzer, and samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform in a 100bp SE read run format.
Vero cells (ATCC-CCL81) grown on T75 flask were infected with recombinant LASV (Josiah strain) at MOI 0.1. At 2 days post infection, cells were lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen). The infection work with pathogenic Lassa virus and RNA lysate preparation were performed at the BSL4 facilities in Galveston National Laboratory in the University of Texas Medical Branch in accordance with institutional health and safety guidelines and federal regulations. Total RNA from the trizol-treated lysates was isolated and DNase treated using the Purelink RNA Minikit (Invitrogen). The purified RNA was then submitted for CAGE-sequencing at Kabushiki Kaisha DNAFORM, Japan.
All mice infection procedures were performed following protocols approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. Six to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 85mg/kg ketamine and 12.5mg/kg xylazine before infection before being inoculated intranasally with 50μl virus re-suspended in PBS. Mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of illness and weight loss after infection. Upon reaching 75% of initial body weight, animals were humanely euthanized with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as per the IACUC protocol.
3 mice were intranasally (i.n.) infected with 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) of viruses in a volume of 50 μL and euthanized at 6 days post-inoculation (d.p.i.). The middle lobe of the lung was collected for total RNA extraction, and the post-caval lobes of the lung was collected to determine virus titers by plaque assay on MDCK cells. Lung tissue was then homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen), and RNA was extracted as per manufacturer’s guidelines. Libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit.
For T cell activation assays with PB1-UFO(SIIN) and PB1-SIIN viruses, OT-I T cells were harvested from the spleen and lymph nodes of OTI transgenic mice and purified on the AutoMACS with the CD8a+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi, Germany). DC2.4 cells were infected with influenza A viruses for 18 hours, and then co-cultured with OTI T cells. T cells were stained with anti-CD25 and anti-CD28 labeled antibodies at 24 hours post co-culture for activation assays. T cell proliferation assays were conducted at 48 hours post infection by measuring CellTrace Violet staining by flow cytometry.
For T cell activation assays with the NS-UFO(SIIN) and NA-SIIN viruses, IAV antigen was propagated by infecting MDCK cells with IAV PR8 wild-type, PR8 containing an NS segment with SIINFEKL inserted into frame 3 (PR8-NS.F3.SIIN) or PR8 containing an NA segment with SIINFEKL inserted into frame 1 (PR8-NA.SIIN) ( Bottermann et al., 2018 4. Bottermann, M. ∙ Foss, S. ∙ van Tienen, L.M. ... TRIM21 mediates antibody inhibition of adenovirus-based gene delivery and vaccination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :10440-10445 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). The IAV antigen preparations were prepared as described ( Stuller et al., 2010; Westerhof et al., 2019 69. Stuller, K.A. ∙ Cush, S.S. ∙ Flaño, E. Persistent gamma-herpesvirus infection induces a CD4 T cell response containing functionally distinct effector populations J. Immunol. 2010; 184 :3850-3856 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar 80. Westerhof, L.M. ∙ McGuire, K. ∙ MacLellan, L. ... Multifunctional cytokine production reveals functional superiority of memory CD4 T cells Eur. J. Immunol. 2019; 49 :2019-2029 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, MDCK cells were infected for 48 h with each IAV stain and then centrifuged, resuspended in 0.1 M glycine buffer containing 0.9% NaCl (pH 9.75), and shaken at 4°C for 20 min. Preparations were sonicated 4 times at 10 s intervals before centrifugation, and the supernatant stored at −80°C.
Bone marrow was then taken from 10-14 week old naive female C57BL/6 mice, purchased from Envigo (UK) and maintained at the University of Glasgow under standard animal husbandry conditions in accordance with UK home office regulations and approved by the local ethics committee. Bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were prepared as previously described ( Westerhof et al., 2019 80. Westerhof, L.M. ∙ McGuire, K. ∙ MacLellan, L. ... Multifunctional cytokine production reveals functional superiority of memory CD4 T cells Eur. J. Immunol. 2019; 49 :2019-2029 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the tibias and femurs were flushed to obtain bone marrow cells. Red blood cells were lysed. Cells were then cultured in RPMI with 10% FCS, 100ug/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 2mM L-glutamine, in the presences of GM-CSF (prepared from X-63 supernatant), for 7 days, with media supplemented on day 2 and replaced on day 5. DCs were then harvested and incubated overnight with IAV antigen preparations. Control BMDCs were incubated with SIINFEKL peptide (Ovalbumin (257-264), chicken, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37°C.
Lymph nodes (LN) (inguinal, brachial, axillary and cervical) and spleen were obtained from OTI mice sacrificed at weeks 12-13. CD8 T cells were negatively selected from LN and spleen using EasySep Mouse CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Stemcell technologies).
BMDCs that had been exposed to viral antigen were co-cultured with CD8+ OTI T cells for 24 h. Activated T cells were detected by immunostaining with antibodies against Va2-E450 (Thermo Fisher), Vb5-PE (M59-4 BD Biosciences), CD8-Alexaflor488 (53-6.7 Thermo Fisher), CD25-APC (PC61.3 Thermo Fisher), CD44-PerCpC5.5 (IM7 Thermo Fisher), and CD69-PerCy7 (H1.2F3 Thermo Fisher). Data were acquired with a BD Fortessa cell analyzer and analyzed by FlowJo (BD, version 10).
Minireplicon assays were performed as previously described ( Rezelj et al., 2019; Tilston-Lunel et al., 2017 57. Rezelj, V.V. ∙ Mottram, T.J. ∙ Hughes, J. ... M Segment-Based Minigenomes and Virus-Like Particle Assays as an Approach To Assess the Potential of Tick-Borne Phlebovirus Genome Reassortment J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e02068-18 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Tilston-Lunel, N.L. ∙ Shi, X. ∙ Elliott, R.M. ... The Potential for Reassortment between Oropouche and Schmallenberg Orthobunyaviruses Viruses. 2017; 9 :220 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, and using the plasmids indicated above, LT-1 transfection reagent (Mirus) was used to transfect sub-confluent BSR-T7/5 cells. After 24 h cells were processed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), with luciferase measured using Glowmax 20/20 luminometer (Promega).
Statistical significance between survival curves were compared using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using Graphpad Prism 8.0 software. Two tailed Student’s t tests under the assumption of equal variances between groups were used to compare weight loss in mice from different groups for each day post infection. Data are shown as +/- SEM.
qPCR assays were done with 4 biological replicates (4 infected mice/condition). Statistical significance in gene expression was calculated with Graphpad Prism 8.0 software, and determined using one-tailed Student’s t test under the assumption of equal variances between groups. Data are shown as mean +/- SEM.
The sequencing of cap-snatched leader sequences was described in detail in a recent publication ( Clohisey et al., 2020 7. Clohisey, S. ∙ Parkinson, N. ∙ Wang, B. ..., FANTOM5 Consortium Comprehensive characterisation of transcriptional activity during influenza A virus infection reveals biases in cap-snatching of host RNA sequences J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e01720-19 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, primary CD14+ human monocytes were isolated from 4 volunteer donors under ethical approval from Lothian Research Ethics Committee (11/AL/0168) and cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml (104 U/ml) recombinant human colony-stimulating factor 1 (a gift from Chiron, USA) for 8 days to differentiate them into macrophages. Monocyte-derived macrophages were then infected with influenza (Udorn) at an MOI of 5, harvested at 0, 2, 7 and 24 hours post-infection (times defined as starting after a 1h adsorption step), and processed for RNA extraction using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) was performed as part of the FANTOM5 project, following the procedure of ( Takahashi et al., 2012 70. Takahashi, H. ∙ Lassmann, T. ∙ Murata, M. ... 5′ end-centered expression profiling using cap-analysis gene expression and next-generation sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :542-561 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data were processed as in ( Forrest et al., 2014 21. Forrest, A.R. ∙ Kawaji, H. ∙ Rehli, M. ..., FANTOM Consortium and the RIKEN PMI and CLST (DGT) A promoter-level mammalian expression atlas Nature. 2014; 507 :462-470 Crossref Scopus (1379) PubMed Google Scholar ) using custom Python scripts available at https://github.com/baillielab/influenza_cage 'ATG analysis.' The datasets analyzed during the current study are available in the Fantom5 repository, https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/data/
Footprints were obtained by first removing the AGATCGGAAGAGC linker and filtering for low quality sequences with Cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 48. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet.journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ). Contigs were then generated from the paired end reads with PANDASeq ( Masella et al., 2012 49. Masella, A.P. ∙ Bartram, A.K. ∙ Truszkowski, J.M. ... PANDAseq: paired-end assembler for illumina sequences BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13 :31 Crossref Scopus (1591) PubMed Google Scholar ) using default parameters. Concurrent demultiplexing of the libraries by sample ID and UMI extraction was then performed. Reads were then aligned against rRNA and tRNA sequences with Bowtie ( Langmead et al., 2009 42. Langmead, B. ∙ Trapnell, C. ∙ Pop, M. ... Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome Genome Biol. 2009; 10 :R25 Crossref Scopus (16255) PubMed Google Scholar ) to remove these contaminating sequences. Unmapped reads were aligned against a custom reference containing the human genome (hg38) and the eight genome segments of PR8 with HISAT2 ( Kim et al., 2015 38. Kim, D. ∙ Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. HISAT: a fast spliced aligner with low memory requirements Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :357-360 Crossref Scopus (12981) PubMed Google Scholar ). Host primer sequences were extracted from this alignment as well as unmapped reads by searching for a match to conserved nucleotides at the 5′ end of the influenza mRNA (GC[GA]AAAGCAGG). These reads were kept if the sequences could be extended to unambiguously assign it to a segment. Finally, 5′ end mapping was performed on these and all reads mapping to PR8.
After adaptor removal with cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 48. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet.journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) and base-quality trimming to remove 3′read sequences if more than 20 bases with Q < 20 were present, paired-end reads were mapped to the mouse (mm10) reference genome with STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 15. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25613) PubMed Google Scholar ), and gene-count summaries were generated with featureCounts ( Liao et al., 2014 44. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (12543) PubMed Google Scholar ). DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 45. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45393) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to variance-normalize the data before a 1-factor model (gene ∼ConditionTimeMutant) was applied to identify differentially expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes were identified as genes that had a 2-fold difference, with an adjusted p .value < 0.01. RNA-seq raw data are deposited in GEO: GSE128519. Gene ontology analysis was performed using Metascape ( Zhou et al., 2019 86. Zhou, Y. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Pache, L. ... Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1523 Crossref Scopus (6900) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Unique chimeric host-virus reads were extracted from the resulting FASTQ files by searching for a match to conserved nucleotides at the 5′ end of the LASV (Josiah Strain) mRNAs (GCAC[M]G[N]GGATCCT), allowing for a maximum of 1 mismatch, and removing all reads with ambiguously mapped nucleotides. The reference genome of LASV was obtained from UniProt (Accessions: J04324 and U73034). Reads were kept if at least 60 nucleotides could be mapped and assigned unambiguously to the viral reference sequences. Each read was then split into host derived or virus derived sequences based on the sequences of viral 5′ end (GCAC[M]G[N]GGATCCT). To calculate potential uvORF length, each read was extended bioinformatically, based off the mapped genome segment and coding sense, and translated from the first AUG found in the read.
Influenza A PB1 nucleotide sequences were obtained from the NCBI database ( Zhang et al., 2017 85. Zhang, Y. ∙ Aevermann, B.D. ∙ Anderson, T.K. ... Influenza Research Database: An integrated bioinformatics resource for influenza virus research Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D466-D474 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only unique sequences containing complete 5′UTR regions were included. Sequences containing ambiguous nucleotides were excluded. Multiple sequence alignment was then performed by using MUSCLE ( Edgar, 2004 17. Edgar, R.C. MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :1792-1797 Crossref Scopus (33596) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We then constructed a codon usage table for each individual nucleotide sequence. To run the random sequence model, each nucleotide sequence was translated into two protein sequences in the two translation reading frames of interest: the canonical PB1 open reading frame (Pr-ORF) and PB1-UFO frame (Pr-UFO). Pr-UFO was considered as the observed protein sequence. Based on the frequencies of synonymous codons within a codon usage table, each Pr-ORF was reverse translated into multiple random nucleotide sequences in the open reading frame (Nt-ORFs) 1,000 times. 1,000 Nt-ORFs were then translated into proteins in the UFO frame (Pr-UFOs) which were considered as the expected protein sequences and their protein lengths were computed. We used the length of observed Pr-UFO and the lengths of expected Pr-UFOs to calculate the z-score for each nucleotide sequence. In total, 3140 unique IAV PB1 (H3N2 only: 499) sequences were included in the analysis. From the z-scores, P values were calculated for the Pr-UFOs occurrence biases. A threshold of p < 0.05 was used for the prediction of the likelihood of IAV PB1 sequences that were able to be translated. Similar analyses were also performed for other genome segments.
Our study was based on a dataset of 26,742 human influenza A/H3N2 sequences available from the GISAID database ( Shu and McCauley, 2017 64. Shu, Y. ∙ McCauley, J. GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data - from vision to reality Euro Surveill. 2017; 22 :30494 Crossref Scopus (1680) PubMed Google Scholar ), which contains 6,244 unique PB1 strains. For downstream analyzes, we included only sequences that are had a complete 5′ and 3′UTR.
We used the most abundant unique, full length PB1 nucleotide sequence as an input to predict RNA secondary structure. RNA secondary structure was predicted using RNAfold from the ViennaRNA Webserver (version 2.4.13) ( Gruber et al., 2008 24. Gruber, A.R. ∙ Lorenz, R. ∙ Bernhart, S.H. ... The Vienna RNA websuite Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :W70-4 Crossref Scopus (1716) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the default settings to calculate the minimum free energy (MFE) structure of the PB1 segment RNA. The output structure was saved in a dot-bracket format, and used to partition nucleotides into probable loop and stem regions for downstream analyses.
Our analysis was based on an ensemble of strain trees obtained from the PB1 sequence dataset described above. Such trees describe the genealogy of influenza strains resulting from an evolutionary process under selection ( Strelkowa and Lässig, 2012 68. Strelkowa, N. ∙ Lässig, M. Clonal interference in the evolution of influenza Genetics. 2012; 192 :671-682 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trees were constructed with maximum-likelihood phylogenies using FastTree ( Price et al., 2010 55. Price, M.N. ∙ Dehal, P.S. ∙ Arkin, A.P. FastTree 2--approximately maximum-likelihood trees for large alignments PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e9490 Crossref Scopus (8655) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used a general time-reversible model. We further refined the tree topology with RAxML ( Stamatakis, 2014 66. Stamatakis, A. RAxML version 8: a tool for phylogenetic analysis and post-analysis of large phylogenies Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1312-1313 Crossref Scopus (22844) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the output topology, we reconstructed maximum-likelihood sequences and timing of internal nodes with the TreeTime package ( Sagulenko et al., 2018 61. Sagulenko, P. ∙ Puller, V. ∙ Neher, R.A. TreeTime: Maximum-likelihood phylodynamic analysis Virus Evol. 2018; 4 :vex042 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A detailed discussion of this method has previously been presented in Strelkowa and Lässig (2012) 68. Strelkowa, N. ∙ Lässig, M. Clonal interference in the evolution of influenza Genetics. 2012; 192 :671-682 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar and Luksza and Lässig (2014) 46. Luksza, M. ∙ Lässig, M. A predictive fitness model for influenza Nature. 2014; 507 :57-61 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar .
Briefly, for a given polymorphism time-series, the frequency propagator 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) can be used as a statistical measure of selection. 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) is defined as the conditional probability that a mutation class of interest, with an initial frequency of 𝑥 𝑖 , reaches a frequency of 𝑥 > 𝑥 𝑖 at a later point in time. This is estimated in our dataset as 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑛 where 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) is the number of mutations that reach frequency 𝑥
and 𝑛 is the total number of mutations
Data availability might vary, depending on the year of sequence collection (fewer data points are available in the earlier years). As such, to attain a more robust measure of selection, we use the ratio of propagators between our mutation class of interest, 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) , against a neutral reference class of mutations, 𝐺 0 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) , to calculate 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) 𝐺 𝑜 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) where, 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) is the likelihood a mutation in a given class reaches frequency, 𝑥 𝐺 𝑜 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) is the likelihood a mutation in the neutral reference class of mutations reaches the same frequency 𝑥 .
The frequency propagator ratio takes into account both numbers and histories of the mutation class of interest. It is a robust measure of selection because it is (a) largely independent of data entry frequency, and (b) insensitive to clonal expansion of mutations.
At the limit 𝑥 = 1 , the propagator ratio 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) reduces to 𝑔 , where 𝑔 = 𝑑 / 𝑛 𝑑 0 / 𝑛 0 and, 𝑑 is the # of mutations in our class of interest that reach fixation 𝑛 is the total # of mutations in the same class of interest 𝑑 0 is the # of mutations in a neutral reference mutation class that reaches fixation 𝑛 0 is the total # of mutations in the same neutral reference mutation class.
Selection on a mutation class of interest can be inferred from the value of 𝑔 . 𝑔 < 1 suggests evolutionary constraints (negative selection) on the mutation class of interest relative to the reference class, where a fraction ( 1 − 𝑔 ) of the mutations are under negative selection. 𝑔 > 1 suggests that fixation of the mutation class of interest undergoes positive selection, and that at least a fraction ( 𝑔 − 1 ) / 𝑔 of that mutation class is beneficial. 𝑔 ≈ 1 suggests weak or heterogenous selection acting on the mutation class of interest, relative to that of the neutral reference class.
To quantify selection occurring across the PB1-UFO frame, we calculated mutation frequencies in the set of codons derived from the following three regions (R1-R3) R1: sequences that encode the N-terminal of PB1-UFO and the viral 5′UTR R2: sequences that encode the C-terminal of PB1-UFO and overlap with the N-terminal of PB1 R3: Sequences that encode for the C-terminal region of the main PB1 ORF and do not overlap with PB1-UFO.
We chose to use synonymous mutations in the main PB1 ORF (reading frame) in R3 as our neutral reference class to calculate 𝐺 0 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) , as we reasoned that the majority of such mutations evolve near neutrality.
To quantify selection on the N-terminal of PB1-UFO in R1, we calculated the 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) for two classes of mutations: Those that changed (non-synonymous in PB1-UFO) or did not change (synonymous in PB1-UFO) the amino acid sequence of PB1-UFO. We used synonymous mutations occurring the PB1 ORF in R3 as our neutral reference class ( 𝐺 0 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) ). We found that 𝑔 < 1 for both cases, suggesting that mutations occurring in this region of PB1-UFO were not likely to be fixed over time, and mostly undergo negative selection, relative to our reference class.
To quantify selection on the C-terminal of PB1-UFO in R2, we again calculated the 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) for mutations that changed (non-synonymous in PB1-UFO) or did not change (synonymous in PB1-UFO) the amino acid sequence of PB1-UFO. We used synonymous mutations occurring the PB1 ORF in R3 as our neutral reference class ( 𝐺 0 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) ) . We found that 𝑔 ≈ 1 for both cases, suggesting that mutations occurring in this region of PB1-UFO underwent heterogenous selection, relative to that of the reference class.
Since R2 mutations in PB1-UFO appear to undergo heterogeneous selection, we asked if selection occurring on the main PB1 ORF was a contributing factor. To do so, we calculated the 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) for mutations that changed (non-synonymous in PB1) or did not change (synonymous in PB1) the amino acid sequence of PB1 in R2. Synonymous mutations occurring the PB1 ORF in R3 as our neutral reference class ( 𝐺 0 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) ) . Here we found that 𝑔 > 1 for synonymous mutations and 𝑔 < 1 for non-synonymous mutations, suggesting that mutations that do NOT alter the amino acid sequence of PB1 are preferentially fixed over time. This suggests to us that part of the reason why PB1-UFO is undergoing heterogeneous selection in R2 is that there is a requirement to maintain the protein sequence of PB1. This is not surprising, given that PB1 is an integral part of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase complex.
Finally, to interrogate the effect of RNA structure, we classified nucleotides as pairing or non-pairing based on the MFE structure (discussed above) calculated by RNAFold. We masked nucleotides that were predicted to base pair (“stem-forming”) from downstream analyses as we reasoned that mutations in these nucleotides are likely to affect both RNA structure AND protein sequence, thus confounding later interpretations of the data. Regions that were not predicted to base pair (“loop nucleotides”) were then used for downstream calculations of frequency propagator ratios. Mutation frequencies were calculated in the same regions (R1, R2 and R3) and reading frames (PB1-UFO versus PB1) as described above. We found that similar effects to before were found, suggesting that RNA structure was not a major contributor to the maintenance of the PB1-UFO frame.
Note: The absolute number of polymorphism histories that reach a given frequency are finite (since the tree is constructed over a defined period of time). This can give rise to sampling fluctuations. These sampling uncertainties are reported as error bars in our figures.
Analyses were done using NetMHC3.4 and NetMHC4.0 ( Andreatta and Nielsen, 2016 1. Andreatta, M. ∙ Nielsen, M. Gapped sequence alignment using artificial neural networks: application to the MHC class I system Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :511-517 Crossref Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binders were filtered using KD threshold of 500 nM. The collection of viral MHC-I epitopes was downloaded from IEDB database and preformatted for BLAST usage (makeblastdb -in iedb.fasta -parse_seqids -dbtype prot). Predicted epitopes from PB1-UFO were BLASTed against IEDB and the human proteome. For comparison with viral antigens we used the following commands: blastp -db iedb.fasta -query antigens.fasta -outfmt “6 qseqid sseqid pident ppos positive mismatch gapopen length qlen slen qstart qend sstart send qseq sseq evalue bitscore” -word_size 3 -gapopen 32767 -gapextend 32767 -evalue 1 -max_hsps_per_subject 1 -matrix BLOSUM62 -max_target_seqs 10000000 -out antigens.iedb.blast.out. For comparison with human proteome we used the command: blastp -db human.proteome.fasta -query antigens.fasta -outfmt “6 qseqid sseqid pident ppos positive mismatch gapopen length qlen slen qstart qend sstart send qseq sseq evalue bitscore” -word_size 3 -gapopen 32767 -gapextend 32767 -evalue 1 -max_hsps_per_subject 1 -matrix BLOSUM62 -max_target_seqs 10000000 -out antigens.human.proteome.blast.out. To find perfect matches between predicted epitopes and human proteome or viral antigens, we used the last command. First, we preformatted the human proteome (ensemble archive from December 2016): lastdb -p human.proteome human.proteome.fasta. Then we used following command to compare epitopes to this database: lastal -f MAF -r 2 -q 1 -m 100000000 -a 100000 -d 15 -l 4 -k 1 -j1 -P 10 human.proteome antigens.netMHC.score.fasta > antigens.human.last.out. Finally, obtained results were processed with bash and python and finally analyzed in PRISM 8. Similar processing was performed with viral antigens.
