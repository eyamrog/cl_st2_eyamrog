Title: Structural analysis of the full-length human LRRK2


Abstract: Summary

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD). LRRK2 regulates critical cellular processes at membranous organelles and forms microtubule-based pathogenic filaments, yet the molecular basis underlying these biological roles of LRRK2 remains largely enigmatic. Here, we determined high-resolution structures of full-length human LRRK2, revealing its architecture and key interdomain scaffolding elements for rationalizing disease-causing mutations. The kinase domain of LRRK2 is captured in an inactive state, a conformation also adopted by the most common PD-associated mutation, LRRK2 G2019S . This conformation serves as a framework for structure-guided design of conformational specific inhibitors. We further determined the structure of COR-mediated LRRK2 dimers and found that single-point mutations at the dimer interface abolished pathogenic filamentation in cells. Overall, our study provides mechanistic insights into physiological and pathological roles of LRRK2 and establishes a structural template for future therapeutic intervention in PD.

Section: Introduction

Mutations in LRRK2 are the most frequent cause of inherited PD, accounting for at least 5% of familial and 1%–2% of idiopathic PD cases ( Di Maio et al., 2018 11.

Studies have identified numerous pathogenic mutations in LRRK2. Generic variations on six sites are disease-causing and high-risk in PD: Asn1437, Arg1441, Tyr1699, and Ser1761 in the ROC-COR domains and Gly2019, Ile2020 in the kinase domain ( Christensen et al., 2018 5.

LRRK2 G2019S , a missense mutation Gly2019Ser, with hyperactive kinase activity, is the most common disease mutation in LRRK2-related PD patients ( Greggio and Cookson, 2009 24.

In addition to PD, an LRRK2 mutation (N2081D) has also been identified by genome-wide association studies as a major susceptibility gene for Crohn’s disease (CD) ( Hui et al., 2018 29.

Med. 2018; 10 :eaai7795 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the clinical relevance, the structure-function relationship underlying these disease-causing mutations is still elusive ( Domingos et al., 2019 12. Domingos, S. ∙ Duarte, T. ∙ Saraiva, L. ...

LRRK2 is a 286-kDa multidomain protein that includes seven sequential domains: armadillo repeat motif (ARM), ankyrin repeat (ANK), leucine-rich repeat (LRR), ras-of-complex (ROC), C-terminal of ROC (COR), kinase (KIN), and WD40 domains. Much progress had been made in illustrating the structure of LRRK2 and its bacterial homolog, ROCO proteins ( Deng et al., 2008 8. Deng, J. ∙ Lewis, P.A. ∙ Greggio, E. ...

Yet, molecular details underlying the functional assembly of the seven domains and their functional roles remain mostly unknown due to the lack of a high-resolution full-length LRRK2 structure.
LRRK2 forms quaternary structures in vivo and in vitro through homo-oligomerization ( Civiero et al., 2017 6. Civiero, L. ∙ Russo, I. ∙ Bubacco, L. ...

Microtubule-dependent filamentous structures of LRRK2 have also been reported under pathogenic conditions ( Deniston et al., 2020 9. Deniston, C.K. ∙ Salogiannis, J. ∙ Mathea, S. ... Structure of LRRK2 in Parkinson’s disease and model for microtubule interaction Nature. 2020; 588 :344-349 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kett et al., 2012 34.

However, not only are atomic details underlying the ROC-COR-mediated dimer yet to be uncovered, but it is also puzzling why LRRK2 exists mostly as monomers and dimers rather than filaments under physiological conditions ( Gilsbach et al., 2018 19. Gilsbach, B.K. ∙ Eckert, M. ∙ Gloeckner, C.J. Regulation of LRRK2: insights from structural and biochemical analysis Biol. Chem. 2018; 399 :637-642 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ).
One key player in the LRRK2 signaling pathway is the Rab GTPase family, which functions as LRRK2 regulators and kinase substrates ( Purlyte et al., 2018 48. Purlyte, E. ∙ Dhekne, H.S. ∙ Sarhan, A.R. ...

Cell Biol. 2020; 63 :102-113 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Membrane-anchored Rab proteins regulate intracellular vesicle trafficking ( Homma et al., 2021 28. Homma, Y. ∙ Hiragi, S. ∙ Fukuda, M. Rab family of small GTPases: an updated view on their regulation and functions FEBS J. 2021; 288 :36-55 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Defective vesicle trafficking is suggested as a culprit of PD and has been reported in cells harboring PD-causative LRRK2 mutations ( Gao et al., 2018 16. Gao, Y. ∙ Wilson, G.R. ∙ Stephenson, S.E.M. ... The emerging role of Rab GTPases in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease Mov. Disord. 2018; 33 :196-207 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rab proteins directly interact with LRRK2 via the ARM and/or ANK domains, recruit LRRK2 to the trans -Golgi network or lysosomes and activate its kinase activity ( Liu et al., 2018 38. Liu, Z. ∙ Bryant, N. ∙ Kumaran, R. ... LRRK2 phosphorylates membrane-bound Rabs and is activated by GTP-bound Rab7L1 to promote recruitment to the trans-Golgi network Hum. Mol.

Yet, little is known about the biological assembly between LRRK2 and Rab proteins.
Here, we present high-resolution structures of full-length human LRRK2 in three physiologically important states: monomer, dimer, and LRRK2 G2019S , using single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis. In light of the vast functional data on human LRRK2 ( Berwick et al., 2019 3. Berwick, D.C. ∙ Heaton, G.R. ∙ Azeggagh, S. ... LRRK2 Biology from structure to dysfunction: research progresses, but the themes remain the same Mol. Neurodegener. 2019; 14 :49 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), our cryo-EM structures provide a deeper molecular understanding of this vital molecule.

Section: Results

The full-length human LRRK2 was purified mainly as monomers in solution ( Figure 1 A) and used for structural analysis. To test whether the protein was still functional after our expression and purification procedure, we measured its kinase activity by using an ADP-Glo kinase assay. As expected, the purified protein catalyzed ATP hydrolysis in the presence of a peptide substrate, LRRKtide ( Jaleel et al., 2007 31. Jaleel, M. ∙ Nichols, R.J. ∙ Deak, M. ... LRRK2 phosphorylates moesin at threonine-558: characterization of how Parkinson’s disease mutants affect kinase activity Biochem. J. 2007; 405 :307-317 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). The LRRK2 inhibitor, GSK2578215A ( Reith et al., 2012 49. Reith, A.D. ∙ Bamborough, P. ∙ Jandu, K. ... GSK2578215A; a potent and highly selective 2-arylmethyloxy-5-substitutent-N-arylbenzamide LRRK2 kinase inhibitor Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012; 22 :5625-5629 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), greatly inhibited the observed catalytic activity ( Figure 1 B). Unexpectedly, we captured structures of LRRK2 in both monomeric and dimeric states at overall resolutions of 3.7 Å and 3.5 Å, respectively ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ). The N terminus of LRRK2 in both monomeric and dimeric states are flexible ( Figures S1 B and S1C). To further improve the map quality, we carried out symmetry expansion for the dimer followed by focused 3D classification and refinement—this improved map resolution of the C-terminal part to 3.1 Å ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ) and allowed de novo model building for the majority of the protein ranging from residue 558 to the end. We performed homology modeling and rigid-body fitting for the illustration of residues 1–557 ( Figures 1 and S2 A).
The LRRK2 monomer adopts a “J” shape, with the longest dimension of ∼225 Å ( Figure 1 C). The extended ARM domain ( Figures 1 C and S2 A) shows flexibility relative to the rest of the protein ( Figure S1 B). The LRR domain of LRRK2 differs from the canonical structure and has a long insertion between the first and second repeats ( Figure S2 B). The truncated LRRK2 RCKW structure, which only contains the ROC, COR, KIN, and WD40 domains, was recently reported ( Deniston et al., 2020 9. Deniston, C.K. ∙ Salogiannis, J. ∙ Mathea, S. ... Structure of LRRK2 in Parkinson’s disease and model for microtubule interaction Nature. 2020; 588 :344-349 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). We compared these four domains from the current structure with LRRK2 RCKW , resulting in a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 5.2 Å. The ROC and COR domains displace significantly relative to the KIN and WD40 domains ( Figure S2 C). When aligned with the ROC domain and viewed from that perspective, the COR domain shows a clockwise rotation in the LRRK2 RCKW structure ( Figure S2 C). Of note, the Thr1343 has a phosphorylation modification in the LRRK2 RCKW sample, which may have contributed to the observed conformational differences.
Despite adding GTP before freezing the sample for cryo-EM analysis, we likely captured LRRK2 in a GDP-bound form, as suggested by the following two observations. First, the GDP fits better in the cryo-EM density ( Figure S2 D). Second, the conformation of the ROC “switch 1” motif, which deviates from the GTP-bound state ( Figure S2 D), favors a GDP molecule. In general, “switch 1” motifs are structurally similar in GTP-bound ROC domains but show variations in the GDP-bound state ( Figure S2 D) ( Eathiraj et al., 2005 13.

Vetter, I.R. ∙ Wittinghofer, A. The guanine nucleotide-binding switch in three dimensions Science. 2001; 294 :1299-1304 Crossref Scopus (1459) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The full-length structure of LRRK2 monomers revealed its overall architecture and enabled us to dissect the interdomain interactions at atomic details ( Figures 2 , 3C, 3 D, S3 A, and S3C), which otherwise was impossible with low-resolution or truncated structures ( Deniston et al., 2020 9. Deniston, C.K. ∙ Salogiannis, J. ∙ Mathea, S. ... Structure of LRRK2 in Parkinson’s disease and model for microtubule interaction Nature. 2020; 588 :344-349 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ; Watanabe et al., 2020 65. Watanabe, R. ∙ Buschauer, R. ∙ Bohning, J. ... The In Situ structure of Parkinson’s disease-linked LRRK2 Cell. 2020; 182 :1508-1518 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two of the interdomain interfaces show high disease relevance ( Figures 2 A and 2B). First, the COR-ROC interface that buries a surface area of ∼2,600 Å 2 is a hotspot for PD disease mutations. All four high-risk mutation sites in ROC and COR domains (Asn1437, Arg1441, Tyr1699, and Ser1761) are found at or near the interface ( Figure 2 A), indicating the importance of the coupling between the ROC and COR domains in PD pathogenesis. Second, the ANK and LRR domains interact with the KIN domain through three sites: two on the C-lobe ( Figures 2 B and 3 D) and one on the N-lobe of the KIN domain ( Figures 3 D and S3 C). One of the C-lobe interacting sites involves Asn2081 ( Figure 2 B), whose mutation to aspartic acid (N2081D) confers risk for Cohn’s diseases ( Hui et al., 2018 29. Hui, K.Y. ∙ Fernandez-Hernandez, H. ∙ Hu, J. ... Functional variants in the LRRK2 gene confer shared effects on risk for Crohn’s disease and Parkinson’s disease Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaai7795 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Asn2081 interacts with the LRR domain through hydrophilic interactions. Mutation of Asn2081Asp, which shows increased kinase activity, is expected to destabilize such interactions. Intriguingly, the autophosphorylation site, Ser1292 ( Gloeckner et al., 2010 20. Gloeckner, C.J. ∙ Boldt, K. ∙ von Zweydorf, F. ... Phosphopeptide analysis reveals two discrete clusters of phosphorylation in the N-terminus and the Roc domain of the Parkinson-disease associated protein kinase LRRK2 J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9 :1738-1745 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ), is also localized in the close vicinity ( Figure 2 B). It is plausible that Asn2018Asp and Ser1292 phosphorylation lead to similar structural changes by introducing negative charges at the interface.
The full-length structure revealed two essential scaffolding helices that mediate multidomain associations ( Figures 2 C and 2D). First, the helix located between the first and second leucine-rich repeats bridges ARM, ANK, and WD40 domains ( Figure 2 C). Such an interactive mode is validated by our ( Table S2 ) and previously published crosslinking mass spectrometry (MS) data ( Guaitoli et al., 2016 25. Guaitoli, G. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Gilsbach, B.K. ... Structural model of the dimeric Parkinson’s protein LRRK2 reveals a compact architecture involving distant interdomain contacts Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E4357-E4366 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, Lys831 at the edge of this helix crosslinked with Lys687 of the ARM domain, Lys756 of the ANK domain, and Lys2378 of the WD40 domain ( Figure 2 C). Because it functions like a hinge for the dynamic motions of the ARM domain, we named it the “hinge helix” ( Figure S1 B). Intriguingly, the hinge helix bridges the interaction between ARM and WD40 domains, which prevents homodimerization of WD40 domains ( Figure S2 E), thereby providing a possible explanation for why LRRK2 does not form filaments under normal physiological conditions. Second, the “C-terminal helix” following the WD40 domain that leans on the back of the KIN domain interacts with the ANK and COR domains ( Figure 2 D). We also found two crosslinking pairs between the ANK domain and the C-terminal helix: Lys739-Lys2515 and Lys773-Lys2520 ( Figure 2 D). The last residue of this helix, Glu2527, is in close proximity to Arg1771 and Arg1866 of the COR domain ( Figure 2 D). These data support the idea that the C-terminal helix functions as a scaffolding element that connects the ANK, KIN, WD40, and COR domains.
The KIN domain of LRRK2 displays key features of an inactive kinase with “DYG” motif and “αC helix” flipping out ( Figure 3 A) ( Ung et al., 2018 61. Ung, P.M. ∙ Rahman, R. ∙ Schlessinger, A. Redefining the protein kinase conformational space with machine learning Cell Chem. Biol. 2018; 25 :916-924.e2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). The regulatory spine (R-spine) ( Kornev and Taylor, 2010 36. Kornev, A.P. ∙ Taylor, S.S. Defining the conserved internal architecture of a protein kinase Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804 :440-444 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ), formed by Leu1935, Leu1924, Tyr2018, and Tyr1992 ( Schmidt et al., 2019 52. Schmidt, S.H. ∙ Knape, M.J. ∙ Boassa, D. ... The dynamic switch mechanism that leads to activation of LRRK2 is embedded in the DFGψ motif in the kinase domain Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :14979-14988 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), is broken ( Figure 3 B). LRRK2 is a rather unusual kinase, because the phenylalanine residue in the highly conserved “DFG” motif is replaced by Tyr2018. In the current structure, Tyr2018 interacts with and sits between Lys1906 and Glu1920 ( Figure 3 A), two of the three hydrophilic regulatory triad residues ( Schmidt et al., 2019 52. Schmidt, S.H. ∙ Knape, M.J. ∙ Boassa, D. ... The dynamic switch mechanism that leads to activation of LRRK2 is embedded in the DFGψ motif in the kinase domain Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :14979-14988 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ) and prevents Lys1906-Glu1920 salt bridge formation. As such, Tyr2018 spatially hinders the positioning of Glu1920 to Lys1906 and ATP, thereby stabilizing the inactive state with “αC helix” flipping out ( Xie et al., 2020 66. Xie, T. ∙ Saleh, T. ∙ Rossi, P. ... Conformational states dynamically populated by a kinase determine its function Science. 2020; 370 :189 Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar ). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the hydroxyl moiety of Tyr2018 serves as a “brake” for kinase activation ( Schmidt et al., 2019 52. Schmidt, S.H. ∙ Knape, M.J. ∙ Boassa, D. ... The dynamic switch mechanism that leads to activation of LRRK2 is embedded in the DFGψ motif in the kinase domain Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :14979-14988 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The LRR domain seems to modulate and stabilize the inactive state of the KIN domain by shielding substrate entry and by maintaining an open ATP-binding cleft ( Figure 3 D). The KIN domain of LRRK2 is surrounded by ANK, LRR, ROC, COR, and WD40 domains ( Figure 3 C). Spatially, the LRR domain wraps around and shields the ATP-binding cleft ( Figure 3 D). As a result, the ATP is not accessible for globular substrates, such as Rab proteins. In addition, LRR contacts the KIN domain through three sites as mentioned ( Figures 2 B, 3 D, and S3 C). By interacting with both the N-lobe and C-lobe of the KIN, the LRR functions as if it is a strut to hold the ATP-binding cleft open, which stabilizes the KIN domain in an inactive state.
We compared the KIN domain of LRRK2 with that of truncated LRRK2 RCKW ( Deniston et al., 2020 9. Deniston, C.K. ∙ Salogiannis, J. ∙ Mathea, S. ... Structure of LRRK2 in Parkinson’s disease and model for microtubule interaction Nature. 2020; 588 :344-349 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). The two structures showed three major differences. First, our structure was determined in the presence of ATP and Mg 2+ , and a strong ATP density was visible in the cryo-EM map ( Figure 3 A). The presence of unhydrolyzed ATP is consistent with an inactive state of the kinase. Second, part of the activation loop (residues 2,017–2,027) in our structure, which hosts the “DYG” motif, forms an alpha helix ( Figures 3 A and S3 B), which may be due to the presence of ATP. Last, the N-lobe of the KIN domain in the current study interacts with the LRR domain through the residues preceding the Gly-rich loop ( Figures S3 B and S3C). As a result, we observed that the β1 strand of the KIN domain becomes a loop and the N-lobe moves toward the LRR domain ( Figures S3 B and S3C).
Because mutation of Gly2019Ser in the “DYG” motif is the most prevalent mutation of LRRK2 in PD, we ask how the Gly2019Ser mutation affects the KIN domain. LRRK2 G2019S increases the kinase activity of LRRK2 (∼1.4-fold) ( Figure 3 E) ( Greggio and Cookson, 2009 24. Greggio, E. ∙ Cookson, M.R. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 mutations and Parkinson’s disease: three questions ASN Neuro. 2009; 1 :e00002 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ), making LRRK2-specific inhibitors of pharmacological interest. To better characterize this mutation, we determined the cryo-EM structure of LRRK2 G2019S at a 3.8-Å resolution ( Table S1 ). The overall structure of LRRK2 G2019S is almost identical to the wild-type LRRK2 ( Figure S3 D). The kinase domains from the two structures have an RMSD of 0.4 Å, with minor differences in flexible loop regions ( Figure 3 F). The structural similarity between LRRK2 wild-type and LRRK2 G2019S leads us to hypothesize that Gly2019Ser mutation does not alter the conformation of LRRK2 significantly but instead affects the kinase kinetics, which is supported by the molecular dynamics analysis ( Schmidt et al., 2020 53. Schmidt, S.H. ∙ Weng, J. ∙ Aoto, P.C. ... Conformation and dynamics of the kinase domain drive subcellular location and activation of LRRK2 bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
We further presented the structure of LRRK2 dimers at an overall resolution of 3.5 Å ( Figures 4 A and S1 A; Table S1 ). Each protomer in the LRRK2 dimer is similar to the LRRK2 monomer with an RMSD of 0.6 Å and is also captured in an ATP-bound kinase-inactive state ( Figure S4 D). The dimeric interface is mainly mediated by the COR domain—mostly by the COR-B subdomain, forming two partially overlapped β sheets ( Figure 4 B). Each β sheet has a “7+1” structure with seven strands from one subunit and one strand from the other subunit. The detailed interactions are shown in Figure 4 B. Because numerous biochemical and structural studies have shown that LRRK2 forms functionally important homodimers through its ROC-COR domains ( Berger et al., 2010 2. Berger, Z. ∙ Smith, K.A. ∙ Lavoie, M.J. Membrane localization of LRRK2 is associated with increased formation of the highly active LRRK2 dimer and changes in its phosphorylation Biochemistry. 2010; 49 :5511-5523 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ; Civiero et al., 2017 6. Civiero, L. ∙ Russo, I. ∙ Bubacco, L. ... Molecular insights and functional implication of LRRK2 dimerization Adv. Neurobiol. 2017; 14 :107-121 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rosenbusch and Kortholt, 2016 50. Rosenbusch, K.E. ∙ Kortholt, A. Activation mechanism of LRRK2 and its cellular functions in Parkinson’s disease Parkinsons Dis. 2016; 2016 :7351985 PubMed Google Scholar ), it leads us to believe that the LRRK2 dimer here is biologically relevant.
The observed LRRK2 dimer interface should be pathologically significant, as suggested by our following structure-function analyses. We docked the ROC-COR dimer into the in situ cryo-ET map of the microtubule-associated LRRK2 filament ( Watanabe et al., 2020 65. Watanabe, R. ∙ Buschauer, R. ∙ Bohning, J. ... The In Situ structure of Parkinson’s disease-linked LRRK2 Cell. 2020; 182 :1508-1518 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ROC-COR dimer model fitted well in the EM density ( Figure S4 A), indicating that the observed dimer is vital for pathogenic LRRK2 filamentation. This observation is further supported by our mutagenesis and live-cell confocal imaging assays. By introducing a point mutation, Met1732Arg, in the dimer interface, we completely abolished the LRRK2 filament formation in HEK293 cells both in the presence and absence of MLi-2 ( Fell et al., 2015 15. Fell, M.J. ∙ Mirescu, C. ∙ Basu, K. ... MLi-2, a potent, selective, and centrally active compound for exploring the therapeutic potential and safety of LRRK2 kinase inhibition J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2015; 355 :397-409 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ), a kinase inhibitor that facilitates LRRK2 filamentation ( Watanabe et al., 2020 65. Watanabe, R. ∙ Buschauer, R. ∙ Bohning, J. ... The In Situ structure of Parkinson’s disease-linked LRRK2 Cell. 2020; 182 :1508-1518 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used a construct expressing GFP-LRRK2 RCKW for the imaging analysis, as it shows a higher percentage of filament formation than the full-length LRRK2 ( Schmidt et al., 2020 53. Schmidt, S.H. ∙ Weng, J. ∙ Aoto, P.C. ... Conformation and dynamics of the kinase domain drive subcellular location and activation of LRRK2 bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
We further proposed that the observed LRRK2 dimer is physiologically important through structurally modeling the Rab-LRRK2 complex ( Figures S4 B and S4C). Rab proteins are kinase substrates and membrane anchors of LRRK2 and thus are key players in LRRK2 signaling ( Liu et al., 2018 38. Liu, Z. ∙ Bryant, N. ∙ Kumaran, R. ... LRRK2 phosphorylates membrane-bound Rabs and is activated by GTP-bound Rab7L1 to promote recruitment to the trans-Golgi network Hum. Mol. Genet. 2018; 27 :385-395 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Purlyte et al., 2018 48. Purlyte, E. ∙ Dhekne, H.S. ∙ Sarhan, A.R. ... Rab29 activation of the Parkinson’s disease-associated LRRK2 kinase EMBO J. 2018; 37 :1-18 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous studies had shown two interacting modes between Rab proteins and LRRK2: one through the ANK domain and the other through the ARM domain of LRRK2 ( McGrath et al., 2021 42. McGrath, E. ∙ Waschbusch, D. ∙ Baker, B.M. ... LRRK2 binds to the Rab32 subfamily in a GTP-dependent manner via its armadillo domain Small GTPases. 2021; 12 :133-146 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Purlyte et al., 2018 48. Purlyte, E. ∙ Dhekne, H.S. ∙ Sarhan, A.R. ... Rab29 activation of the Parkinson’s disease-associated LRRK2 kinase EMBO J. 2018; 37 :1-18 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the possible Rab-interacting residues of the ANK domain are not accessible in current structures, we modeled the interaction between the ARM domain and Rab32-subfamily proteins (Rab29, Rab32, and Rab38) to understand the Rab-dependent membrane recruitment mechanism of LRRK2 ( Figures S4 B and S4C). The potential Rab-interacting regions of the ARM domain (residues 386–392) are located on the same side of LRRK2 dimers. Docking Rab proteins on this region is compatible with membrane geometry without generating any obvious crashing. We think such a complex assembly could represent the membrane-associated inactive state of LRRK2 (GDP-bound) in the “Rab-dependent LRRK2 activation model” proposed by Berwick et al. (2019) 3. Berwick, D.C. ∙ Heaton, G.R. ∙ Azeggagh, S. ... LRRK2 Biology from structure to dysfunction: research progresses, but the themes remain the same Mol. Neurodegener. 2019; 14 :49 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar .

Section: Discussion

In this study, we reported the cryo-EM structures of full-length LRRK2 of different states. The structures enabled us to dissect the domain arrangement of this large multidomain protein, analyze disease mutations, and study the biological significance of the dimer arrangement and thus opened another chapter for the structure-function analysis of LRRK2.
The structures provide a unique opportunity to rationalize the functional consequences of disease mutations guided by structural information. In addition to the six disease-causing PD mutations and one CD mutation discussed above, LRRK2 also hosts many PD-association variants, including the Gly2385Arg mutation (LRRK2 G2385R ) in the WD40 domain that is common in Chinese population ( Mata et al., 2005 41. Mata, I.F. ∙ Kachergus, J.M. ∙ Taylor, J.P. ... Lrrk2 pathogenic substitutions in Parkinson’s disease Neurogenetics. 2005; 6 :171-177 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). LRRK2 G2385R was shown to disrupt WD40 dimers and the formation of pathogenic filaments in cells ( Watanabe et al., 2020 65. Watanabe, R. ∙ Buschauer, R. ∙ Bohning, J. ... The In Situ structure of Parkinson’s disease-linked LRRK2 Cell. 2020; 182 :1508-1518 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2019 68. Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Ru, H. ... Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1579-1584 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this does not explain how LRRK2 G2385R is associated with PD. Here, we show that Gly2385 is located at the interface between WD40 and the hinge helix ( Figure 2 C). Arg841 of the hinge helix is pointing toward Gly2385. It is possible that introducing a positively charged arginine at the position of Gly2385 could disrupt the interaction between the WD40 domain and the hinge helix, destabilize the observed inactive state of LRRK2, and thus cause PD. Consistently, it had been shown that LRRK2 G2385R moderately enhanced Rab10 phosphorylation by ∼2-fold ( Zhang et al., 2019 68. Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Ru, H. ... Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1579-1584 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The inactive-state structure of LRRK2 G2019S serves as a structural framework for designing conformation-specific LRRK2 inhibitors for treating PD. LRRK2 G2019S showed little structural difference from wild-type, suggesting the LRRK2 G2019S may not cause a significant change in conformation, at least under certain experimental conditions. However, the inactive-state structure of LRRK2 G2019S does provide the opportunity to design conformation-specific inhibitors for PD treatment. On the one hand, structural insights into inactive states of kinases are usually leveraged to design selective inhibitors ( Noble et al., 2004 44. Noble, M.E.M. ∙ Endicott, J.A. ∙ Johnson, L.N. Protein kinase inhibitors: insights into drug design from structure Science. 2004; 303 :1800-1805 Crossref Scopus (1137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xie et al., 2020 66. Xie, T. ∙ Saleh, T. ∙ Rossi, P. ... Conformational states dynamically populated by a kinase determine its function Science. 2020; 370 :189 Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar ). On the other hand, LRRK2 G2019S is the most common PD-causing mutation in LRRK2. Conformation-specific small molecules targeting this mutation could be of great pharmacological significance.
Last, our structural and functional data have important implications for other possible conformations of LRRK2. LRRK2 is believed to adopt states different from the current structures. Our data suggest that conformational changes between different states of LRRK2 could be large. First, the autophosphorylation site Ser1292 ( Sheng et al., 2012 56. Sheng, Z. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Bustos, D. ... Ser1292 autophosphorylation is an indicator of LRRK2 kinase activity and contributes to the cellular effects of PD mutations Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :164ra161 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ) is ∼25 Å away from ATP ( Figure 2 B); the distance between those two sites in neighboring subunit is ∼99 Å. The two sites need to be in close vicinity to carry out autophosphorylation. Second, the dimerization of WD40 for the filament formation requires rearrangement of the hinge helix and ARM domain ( Figure S2 E). Third, crosslinking data suggest that the hinge helix can move out from the interface between WD40 and ANK–ARM domains. For example, Lys831 of the hinge helix crosslinks with Lys1963 of the KIN domain in both our ( Table S2 ) and previous published crosslinking results with high confidence ( Guaitoli et al., 2016 25. Guaitoli, G. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Gilsbach, B.K. ... Structural model of the dimeric Parkinson’s protein LRRK2 reveals a compact architecture involving distant interdomain contacts Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E4357-E4366 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the structural illustration of the above conformation(s) requires further investigation, our current study paves the way for obtaining a complete conformational landscape of LRRK2, dissecting its physiological and pathological roles and developing inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.
The proposed structural model for LRRK2 recruitment by Rab proteins in the context of the membrane bilayer ( Figure S4 B) needs to be experimentally verified.

The three-dimensional cryo-EM density maps for human LRRK2 monomer, dimer, symmetry expanded monomer and LRRK2 G2019S monomer have been deposited in the EM Database under accession codes EMDB: EMD-23352, EMD-23350, EMD-23360, and EMD-23359, and the coordinates for the structure have been deposited in Protein Data Bank under accession codes PDB: 7LHW , 7LHT , 7LI4 , and 7LI3 .
Adherent HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C. Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900 III SFM medium (GIBCO) at 27°C. HEK293F cells were cultured in Freestyle 293 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% Pen Strep at 37°C.
The cDNAs encoding human LRRK2 were purchased from Horizon Discovery and contains three natural variants (R50H, S1647T and M2397T) from the canonical LRRK2 sequence (NP_940980.4). A GFP tag followed by a preScission protease cleavage site was engineered at the N terminus of LRRK2, which was cloned into the BacMam expression vector ( Goehring et al., 2014 21. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recombinant baculoviruses of LRRK2 were generated using the Bac-to-Bac system according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Then P3 virus of LRRK2 was used for transfection of HEK293F cells for protein expression. Briefly, for 1L cultures of HEK293F cells (∼2-3x10 6 cells/mL) in Freestyle 293 media (GIBCO) supplemented with 2% FBS (GIBCO), about 100 mL P3 virus was used. Infected cells were incubated at 37°C overnight, and protein expression was induced by adding 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cells were cultured at 30°C for another 48-60 h before harvest.
Cell pellet from 600 mL culture was resuspended in 30 mL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT and protease inhibitors), and then cells were lysed by brief sonication. LRRK2 was separated from the insoluble fraction by high-speed centrifugation (38,000 g for 1 hr), and incubated with 1 mL CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) coupled with 1 mg high-affinity GFP nanobodies (GFP-NB) ( Kirchhofer et al., 2010 35. Kirchhofer, A. ∙ Helma, J. ∙ Schmidthals, K. ... Modulation of protein properties in living cells using nanobodies Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 :133-138 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GFP tag was cleaved by preScission protease at 4°C, and LRRK2 was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography with a Superose 6 increased 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. Fractions of the peak around 14 mL were pooled, and then ATP and Mg 2+ were added to a final concentration of 2 mM and 1 mM, respectively. The protein sample was concentrated to 6-8 mg/ml (OD280) using a 100-kDa MWCO centrifugal device (Ambion) and immediately used for cryoEM grid preparation. 0.5 mM GTP and 2 mM Fluorinated Fos-choline-8 (FFC-8) were added 15-30 min before freezing.
The kinase activity of LRRK2 and LRRK2 G2019S was measured using a commercially available ADP-Glo assay. Briefly, 2 μl purified LRRK2 (0.5 μM), 2 μl LRRKtide (0.5 mM) and 1 μl ATP (0.5 mM) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 100 min. 5 μl ADP-Glo reagent was added, followed by another 40 min incubation. 10 μl kinase detection reagent was then added. Luminescence was taken after a 30-min incubation at an integration time of 1 s. The GSK2578215A was added to the protein sample for the inhibition assay at a final concentration of 1 μM 2 min before the assay.
The size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) ( Kendrick et al., 2001 33. Kendrick, B.S. ∙ Kerwin, B.A. ∙ Chang, B.S. ... Online size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography light scattering and differential refractometry methods to determine degree of polymer conjugation to proteins and protein-protein or protein-ligand association states Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299 :136-146 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) experiments were carried out using WTC-030S5 (MW range 5,000-1,250,000 Da) size-exclusion column (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) with three detectors connected in series: an Agilent 1200 ultraviolet (UV) detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), a Wyatt DAWN-HELEOS-II multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and a Wyatt Optilab T-rEX differential refractive index (RI) detector (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The column was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. The data was collected at 25°C. A 100 μL sample in volume was injected into the column using an auto-sample injection method with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein in the eluent was detected via UV absorbance at 280 nm, light scattering, and refractive index detectors. The data were recorded and analyzed with the Wyatt Astra software (version 8.0). The refractive index increment, dn/dc, was assumed to be 0.185 ml/g for measuring the concentration of the protein samples. EASI Graphs (Astra software) were exported and plotted as a molar mass distribution superimposed on a light scattering and UV traces versus elution volume.
LRRK2 (30 μg) was crosslinked with DSSO ( Kao et al., 2011 32. Kao, A. ∙ Chiu, C.L. ∙ Vellucci, D. ... Development of a novel cross-linking strategy for fast and accurate identification of cross-linked peptides of protein complexes Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 :002212 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a 1:900 protein-to-crosslinker molar ratio. The reaction was carried out at room temperature (RT) for 1 hr and then quenched with excess ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) for 30 min at RT. Denaturation buffer was added to reach 8 M urea concentration, followed by reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Then the sample was diluted with 50 mM ABC to the final concentration of 2 M urea. Trypsin was added to a protease-to-substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w), and the sample was incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Asp-N was added to the trypsin digested sample with a protease-to-substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w) at 37°C overnight. Digestion reaction was stopped with 10% trifluoroacetic acid. A negative control sample with the addition of the same level of DMSO instead of DSSO was also analyzed.
The digested peptides were analyzed by customized two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS) ( Liu et al., 2021 39. Liu, D. ∙ Yang, S. ∙ Kavdia, K. ... Deep Profiling of Microgram-Scale Proteome by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry J. Proteome Res. 2021; 20 :337-345 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pre-fractionation was performed by basic pH RPLC using a microscale HPLC system (Agilent 1120) coupled with a 3-way flow splitter (IDEX Health & Science). The digested sample was speed vacuumed to almost dry to avoid sample loss and resuspended with mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 8.0), centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min. With the flow splitter closed, the supernatant was loaded onto an XBridge C18 column (1 mm × 50 mm, 3.5 μm beads, Waters) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min by 95% of mobile phase A. After loading, the flow splitter was opened, and the peptides were eluted with a 45 min gradient from 5%–90% of mobile phase B (90% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 8.0). With the flow splitter, the HPLC was operated at 800 μl/min, but the column was eluted at 30 μl/min. Six fractions were manually collected.
Further LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC coupled with a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Q Exactive HF. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.2% formic acid (FA) in water and mobile phase B consisted of 0.2% FA in acetonitrile. Peptides were loaded into a self-packed C4 column (75 μm × 20 cm, Halo C4, 3.4 μm particles, 400 Å pore size) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min with the following gradient: 10% to 30% mobile phase B over 40 min, 30% to 50% mobile phase B in 5 min, 50% to 80% mobile phase B in 5 min, static 80% mobile phase B for 3 min, and equilibration at 3% mobile phase B for 15 min ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, H. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Systematic optimization of long gradient chromatography mass spectrometry for deep analysis of brain proteome J. Proteome Res. 2015; 14 :829-838 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). MS1 scans were detected in the Orbitrap at 120K resolution in the m/z range 400–2000 and AGC target of 1 × 10 6 with a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Ions with charge states from 3+ to 8+ were selected for fragmentation by stepped high energy collision dissociation (HCD) at 27%, 30%, 33% with AGC of 1 × 10 5 , maximum injection time of 100 ms, and detected in the Orbitrap at 60K resolution.
Raw data were converted to .mzXML format using MSconvert and searched with MeroX2.0 ( Iacobucci et al., 2018 30. Iacobucci, C. ∙ Götze, M. ∙ Ihling, C.H. ... A cross-linking/mass spectrometry workflow based on MS-cleavable cross-linkers and the MeroX software for studying protein structures and protein-protein interactions Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :2864-2889 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ) for crosslinked peptides and JUMP ( Wang et al., 2014 63. Wang, X. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Wu, Z. ... JUMP: a tag-based database search tool for peptide identification with high sensitivity and accuracy Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2014; 13 :3663-3673 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ) for regular peptides. Settings for crosslinking search were as follows: maximum total missed cleavage, 3; peptide length, 5-30; static modification, carbamidomethylation of cysteine; dynamic modification, oxidation of methionine; cross linker, DSSO, assumed reaction site at lysine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine; modification of fragments, with 54.0105 Da and 85.9826 Da mass modification; MS1 precision, 10 ppm; MS2 precision, 10 ppm; RISEUP Mode with 2 maximum missing ions; Prescore, 10% intensity; FDR cut off, 5%; Score cut off, −1; Include cRAP database; Decoy database generation, shuffle sequence but keep protease sites. Results from the MeroX search were manually validated using the following 5 criteria after the calibration of mass accuracy: (i) 5 ppm mass tolerance of precursor ions; (ii) validation of at least two signature product ions within 5 ppm mass tolerance; (iii) continuity of b and y ions within 5 ppm mass tolerance; (iv) presence of branched product ions within 5 ppm mass tolerance; and (v) absence in the negative control run.
CryoEM grids were prepared with a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 holey carbon gold grids were glow-discharged for 15 s. Then 3.5 μL of 6-8 mg/ml protein sample was pipetted onto the grids, which were blotted for 3 s under blot force −3 at 100% humidity and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled liquid ethane.
CryoEM data were collected using Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher) transmission electron microscope, equipped with a K3 direct electron detector and post column GIF (energy filter). K3 gain references were collected just before data collection. Data collection was performed in SerialEM software ( Mastronarde, 2005 40. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3088) PubMed Google Scholar ) with image shift protocol (9 images were collected with one defocus measurements). Movies were recorded at defocus values from −0.8 to −1.7 μm at a magnification of 105kx, which corresponds to the pixel size of 0.826 Å at the specimen level (super-resolution pixel size is 0.413). During 2.8 s exposure, 70 frames (0.04 s per frame and the dose of 1.154 e/frame/Å 2 ) were collected with a total dose of ∼81 e. In total, 12,576 images were collected. Motion correction was performed on raw super-resolution movie stacks and binned by 2 using MotionCor2 software ( Zheng et al., 2017 69. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ). CTF parameters were determined using CTFind and refined later in Relion 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 71. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2803) PubMed Google Scholar ), CisTEM ( Grant et al., 2018 23. Grant, T. ∙ Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. cis TEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing eLife. 2018; 7 :e35383 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 47. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3664) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior particles picking micrographs were analyzed for good power spectrum, and the bad ones were discarded (with 9,804 good images remained). Particles were picked within cisTEM and later coordinates were transferred to Relion 3.0 (in total 1,214,310 particles).
After extraction binned by 8 particles in Relion3.0, the particle stack was transferred to cryoSPARC. Several rounds of the 2D classification using 8x binned particles (pixel size = 6.608 Å/pixel) were performed to eliminate ice, carbon edges, and false-positive particles containing noise resulted in approximately 479,170 particles for further analysis. During 2D classification, two groups of classes were observed. The first group was corresponding to the monomer and the other to the dimer. Both groups were selected, and ab initio reconstruction was performed. In order to further separate dimers from monomers, we perform Heterogeneous Refinement in cryoSPARC with particles bin by 2 (pix size 1.652 Å/pixel). As a result, 231,875 particles were assigned to the dimer class and 129,744 particles to the monomer. Both 3D classes were refined in parallel using cryoSPARC and Relion3.1 software after extraction of corresponding particles without binning (pix size 1.652 Å/pixel). For monomer, we performed a focused 3D refinement in addition to a standard refinement. As to the dimer, we have implemented C2 and C1 symmetry refinement. We also perform a symmetry expansion procedure in order to get a better resolution for the C-terminal part of the protein. Particle transfer between Relion and cryoSPARC were done by using script from Daniel Asarnow (UCSF, laboratory of Prof. Yifan Cheng). At the final step for both the monomer and dimer, CTF refinement and high order aberration correction were performed. The density maps sharpened in cryoSPARC or Relion3.1 were used to produce figures.
Models were built in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 14. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19617) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, homology models of LRRK2 individual domains except the WD40 domain were generated using the I-TASSER server ( Yang et al., 2015 67. Yang, J. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Roy, A. ... The I-TASSER Suite: protein structure and function prediction Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :7-8 Crossref Scopus (4261) PubMed Google Scholar ) and docked into the cryoEM map. The WD40 domain from a crystal structure was docked into the cryoEM density. From this starting point, manual rebuilding was carried out for the symmetry expansion map (3.1 Å). The structural model was refined using the phenix.real_space_refine ( Afonine et al., 2013 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Bulk-solvent and overall scaling revisited: faster calculations, improved results Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2013; 69 :625-634 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ) with secondary structure restraints and Coot iteratively. Protein structure quality was monitored using the Molprobity server ( Chen et al., 2010 4. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (10875) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then modeled the monomer and dimer using the above structure as a starting point, following a similar procedure. Figures were prepared using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC.) and UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 46. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32501) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To model the membrane recruitment of LRRK2 by Rab32-subfamily members (Rab29, Rab32 and Rab38), we used the Rab38 structure (PDB 6HDU ) and the homology model of the LRRK2 ARM domain. Here, Rab38 structure is used for the following reasons. First, it shares high sequence identity (52%) to Rab29, which is the most studied Rab protein that recuits LRRK2 to membrane surface. Second, a GTP-bound structure of Rab38 is available, as LRRK2-Rab interaction is GTP-dependent. Third, Rab38 also interacts with LRRK2 through ARM domain and could potentially recruit LRRK2 to membrane surface. Of note, Rab38, unlike Rab29, is not a substrate as it lacks the conserved Threonine/Serine residue within the Switch 2 motif. The modeling was performed using the PatchDock server ( Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005 54. Schneidman-Duhovny, D. ∙ Inbar, Y. ∙ Nussinov, R. ... PatchDock and SymmDock: servers for rigid and symmetric docking Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :W363-7 Crossref Scopus (2426) PubMed Google Scholar ). The interacting residues were given based on the mutagenesis data from the previous study ( McGrath et al., 2021 42. McGrath, E. ∙ Waschbusch, D. ∙ Baker, B.M. ... LRRK2 binds to the Rab32 subfamily in a GTP-dependent manner via its armadillo domain Small GTPases. 2021; 12 :133-146 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model with the largest interacting interface was used here in Figure S4 B.
The day before transfection, HEK293T cells incubated in DMEM medium were plated on 30 mm glass bottom dishes pretreated with Poly-D-lysine. The LRRK2 RCKW was subcloned from the pDEST53-LRRK2-WT vector (Addgene: 25044). Cells were transfected with 1 μg plasmid expressing GFP-LRRK2 RCKW or GFP-LRRK2 RCKW(M1732R) using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher). After 48 h, DMEM medium was replaced with phenol red free medium. Cells were treated with either DMSO or MLi-2 drugs for 2 h before live cell imaging experiments.
All confocal microscopy was performed at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Images were acquired on a 3i Marianas system (Denver, CO USA) configured with a Yokogawa CSU-W spinning disk utilizing a 100x (1.46 NA) Zeiss objective. Z stack images were acquired with a step size of 0.2 microns onto a Prime95B sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics, Tucson AZ, USA). Images were processed using the SlideBook reader ( https://www.intelligent-imaging.com/slidebook ) and the ImageJ software ( https://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij )
The kinase activity assay in Figures 1 B and 3 C were visualized using Microsoft Excel and the values were averages of the four (N = 4) independent determinations with standard deviations. The quantification and statistical analyses for model refinement and validation were generated using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 4. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (10875) PubMed Google Scholar ).
