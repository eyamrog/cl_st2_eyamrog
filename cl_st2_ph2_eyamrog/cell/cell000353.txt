Title: Dual modes of CRISPR-associated transposon homing


Abstract: Summary

Tn7-like transposons have co-opted CRISPR systems, including class 1 type I-F, I-B, and class 2 type V-K. Intriguingly, although these CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) undergo robust CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided transposition, they are almost never found in sites targeted by the crRNAs encoded by the cognate CRISPR array. To understand this paradox, we investigated CAST V-K and I-B systems and found two distinct modes of transposition: (1) crRNA-guided transposition and (2) CRISPR array-independent homing. We show distinct CAST systems utilize different molecular mechanisms to target their homing site. Type V-K CAST systems use a short, delocalized crRNA for RNA-guided homing, whereas type I-B CAST systems, which contain two distinct target selector proteins, use TniQ for RNA-guided DNA transposition and TnsD for homing to an attachment site. These observations illuminate a key step in the life cycle of CAST systems and highlight the diversity of molecular mechanisms mediating transposon homing.

Section: Introduction

CRISPR-Cas systems are adaptive immune systems employed by prokaryotes to defend against foreign genetic elements ( Barrangou and Horvath, 2017 3. Barrangou, R. ∙ Horvath, P.

CRISPR-Cas components have been associated with multiple roles beyond adaptive immunity ( Faure et al., 2019a 9. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Yan, W.X. ...

Two distinct subtypes of CRISPR-associated transposon (CAST) systems have been experimentally characterized to date that facilitate RNA-guided targeting of Tn7-like transposons: V-K CAST systems, which utilize Cas12k effectors with naturally inactivated nuclease domains ( Strecker et al., 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ), and I-F CAST systems, which utilize Cascade complexes lacking the Cas3 nuclease component ( Klompe et al., 2019 19. Klompe, S.E. ∙ Vo, P.L.H. ∙ Halpin-Healy, T.S. ... Transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration Nature. 2019; 571 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, type I-B CAST systems, which also contain components of the Cascade effector in association with Tn7-like transposons, but are extremely rare compared to other CAST systems, have been bioinformatically identified but not yet experimentally characterized ( Faure et al., 2019a 9.

The prototypical Tn7 transposon from Escherichia coli mediates transposition using the core transposase proteins, TnsA, TnsB, and TnsC. These transposase proteins operate in two modes: (1) homing, where TnsABC interact with TnsD, a site-specific DNA-binding protein, to achieve transposition into the chromosomal glmS attachment site (also referred to as the homing site), or (2) mobile element transposition, where TnsABC interact with TnsE, a protein that preferentially directs the transposon to mobile elements including conjugative plasmids ( Peters and Craig, 2001 27.

These two pathways allow the transposon to safely and efficiently travel from one host to another: after traveling through a mobile element, the TnsD pathway targets a site conserved across hosts to safely home to bacterial chromosomes. CAST systems, which lack tnsE , rely on spacers within their CRISPR arrays to achieve targeted transposition ( Klompe et al., 2019 19. Klompe, S.E. ∙ Vo, P.L.H. ∙ Halpin-Healy, T.S. ...

RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ), likely to mobile genetic elements ( Faure et al., 2019a 9. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Yan, W.X. ... CRISPR-Cas in mobile genetic elements: counter-defence and beyond Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :513-525 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019b 10. Faure, G. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Koonin, E.V.

USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). The majority of identified CAST systems in bacterial chromosomes, however, are not located at targets programmed by their CRISPR array, but are rather found next to conserved sequences, including IMPDH and SRP RNA in the case of type I-F ( Faure et al., 2019a 9. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Yan, W.X. ... CRISPR-Cas in mobile genetic elements: counter-defence and beyond Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :513-525 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peters et al., 2017 28. Peters, J.E. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Shmakov, S. ... Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that CAST systems might have an innate homing site. This is also supported by the observation that all known CAST systems identified to date contain tniQ (a homolog of tnsD ), and, in the case of type I-B, two tniQ genes. Here, we investigate how CAST systems specifically transpose to bacterial chromosomes and identify two distinct modes of homing in type V-K and type I-B systems involving RNA-mediated and protein-mediated homing, respectively.
We first conducted a bioinformatic survey to determine where type V-K CAST systems are found in bacterial genomes. Comparison of type V-K CAST loci revealed that the transposons preferentially localize to tRNA genes, as previously noted ( Klompe et al., 2019 19. Klompe, S.E. ∙ Vo, P.L.H. ∙ Halpin-Healy, T.S. ... Transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration Nature. 2019; 571 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ), and insertions are typically oriented with Cas12k proximal to the tRNA (46 out of 53 analyzed systems) ( Figure 1 A). We also observed two insertions neighboring the DNA mismatch repair genes MutS and MutL , suggesting potential non-random chromosome targets outside of tRNA at a lower frequency. We previously showed that CAST from Scytonema hofmannii (ShCAST) can be reconstituted to achieve RNA-guided transposition in E. coli ( Strecker et al., 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we tested whether it can insert next to the tRNA independent of Cas12k. However, expression of tnsB , tnsC , and tniQ along with the introduction of a pDonor plasmid and a pTarget plasmid containing the re-joined flanking chromosomal sequence did not yield any homing insertions into pTarget as assayed by PCR ( Figure S1 A). Therefore, we reasoned that another mechanism or protein might be required to direct the ShCAST transposon to its homing target. In the process of analyzing the left end (LE) sequence of ShCAST, we unexpectedly observed a 17-bp motif that perfectly matches the adjacent tRNA-Leu gene. Further analysis revealed the sequence upstream of this motif has partial homology to the CRISPR direct repeat, indicating that this matching sequence could be a delocalized CRISPR RNA (crRNA) ( Figure 1 B). The delocalized crRNA has a number of mismatches to the direct repeats in the CRISPR array and is irregularly spaced with respect to the array (that is why it was not previously identified), but it does contain 13 nt that perfectly match the 3′ end of the canonical direct repeat ( Figure S1 B). The 17-bp tRNA target sequence is flanked by a GGTT PAM sequence, and the LE of ShCAST is positioned 64 bp downstream of the PAM, consistent with target site requirements observed for crRNA-guided transposition ( Strecker et al., 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, we note that a similar discovery of delocalized crRNA for type I-F CAST systems was recently uncovered ( Petassi et al., 2020 14. Petassi, M.T. ∙ Hsieh, S.-C. ∙ Peters, J.E. Guide RNA categorization enables target site choice in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas transposons Cell. 2020; 183 :1757-1771 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a potential common mechanism for CAST homing.
We first tested whether the delocalized crRNA is functional by expressing the natural sequence containing a 37-nt direct repeat and 31-nt spacer (to match the length of crRNA from the adjacent CRISPR array), with only 17 nt of spacer matching the target ( Figure 1 C), and co-transformed E. coli with pHelper, pDonor, and the tRNA-Leu target plasmid. We observed insertions adjacent to the tRNA, and deep sequencing revealed an insertion product with the LE positioned 60- to 70-bp downstream of the spacer ( Figure 1 D), including the most prominent position at 64 bp that matches the natural insertion found in S. hofmannii . We next tested the sequence requirements of the delocalized crRNA by removing 5′ and 3′ sequences. We found the 5′ extension of the 13-nt short direct repeat is dispensable for function whereas loss of the 3′ sequence reduced insertion activity ( Figure 1 C), even though the additional spacer nucleotides do not match the target site. We observed that a minimal crRNA comprised of a 13-nt direct repeat and 17-nt spacer is also capable of homing ( Figure 1 C). We note that the low insertion activity observed with the delocalized crRNA is likely due to the specific spacer sequence, because targeting PSP1, a previously validated spacer for ShCAST ( Strecker et al. 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the same constructs revealed higher activity even though both targets contain the same GGTT PAM ( Figure S1 C). Interestingly, swapping the delocalized crRNA direct repeat with a canonical direct repeat from the CRISPR array reduced activity between 2- to 10-fold ( Figure 1 C), suggesting that the delocalized direct repeat might be more efficient at annealing with the tracrRNA and loading into Cas12k.
Only the final 13 nt of the direct repeat is predicted to bind to the tracrRNA ( Figure 1 E). To determine if the delocalized crRNA represents the absolute minimal targeting requirements for ShCAST, we performed additional truncation analysis of the delocalized crRNA. We were able to delete an additional 3 nt from the 5′ end of the direct repeat, however, no deletions to the 17-nt homing spacer were tolerated ( Figure S1 D). We also tested the insertion activity of ShCAST using a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) containing the 13-nt direct repeat from the delocalized crRNA ( Strecker et al. 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ) by deleting different lengths of spacer sequence. We found that 16 nt is both sufficient and near the minimum length required for function ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Adding double mismatches between the spacer and target revealed that positions 1–16 are sensitive to mutation, while mismatches in positions 17–22 had limited effect on activity ( Figure S1 G), supporting the idea that only 16 nt of complementary sequence is required for targeted transposition activity. Together these results reveal that the delocalized crRNA is functional for CAST homing and has likely evolved to contain the minimal RNA sequence required for function.
The discovery of a delocalized crRNA in ShCAST led us to examine other type V-K CAST loci, and we were able to identify a delocalized crRNA in 51 out of 53 systems and a matching genomic insertion site in 46 of these 51 systems ( Figure 2 A; Table S1 ). Spacers associated with delocalized crRNAs were 16 or 17 nt in length with only a few observed mismatches to their cognate targets, and all delocalized crRNAs contained the terminal 12–14 nt of the canonical direct repeat ( Figure S2 A). Analysis of tRNA-targeting spacers revealed several frequent sequences including those which target tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Pro ( Figure S2 B). The location of the delocalized crRNA varied between CAST systems, sometimes occurring as close as 12 bp from the terminal repeat in the array ( Figure 2 A), and generally with irregular spacing compared to the CRISPR array. This observation suggests that the delocalized crRNAs were not acquired in the same manner as those in the CRISPR array and might be a structural feature of the transposon. Prominent examples of this include the CAST systems from Cyanobacterium aponinum IPPAS B-1201 and Geminocystis sp. NIES-3709, wherein the delocalized crRNAs are fully embedded within the LE sequence and are over 200 bp from the CRISPR array. Interestingly, delocalized crRNAs are not limited to tRNA targets: the genome insertions adjacent to MutS , MutL , and CysH were also found to match a delocalized crRNA within corresponding transposons ( Figure 2 A). We identified two additional CAST systems that contain a delocalized crRNA targeting tRNA but lack detectable CRISPR arrays ( Figure 2 B). It is possible that these two transposons might have the ability to home to conserved bacterial sites but have yet to acquire the ability to target diverse mobile genetic elements or have lost their CRISPR array. Finally, although the locations of delocalized crRNA targets varied within the cognate genes, because CAST systems insert downstream of the target site, gene integrity was preserved in all cases, with the closest insertions being only 2 bp from the end of the tRNA gene ( Figure 2 C).
To investigate the identity and expression of the delocalized crRNA in natural cyanobacteria, we analyzed small RNA-sequencing data of two CAST system hosts: S. hofmannii and Anabaena cylindrica ( Strecker et al., 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we were unable to detect expression of the delocalized crRNA in S. hofmannii ( Figure 2 D), we could readily detect a small RNA species that matched the predicted delocalized crRNA in A. cylindrica ( Figure 2 C). The delocalized crRNA from A. cylindrica most commonly contained a 12-nt minimal direct repeat, and ended 2 nt downstream of the 17-nt tRNA spacer ( Figure S2 C). Based on our experimental characterization of ShCAST, this minimal crRNA contains the required features for RNA-guided transposition and is predicted to be functional. Together, these results suggest that the delocalized crRNA is expressed in some native hosts, but is likely under regulation, and these delocalized crRNAs function to home type V-K CAST systems to conserved locations on bacterial chromosomes.
To investigate the generality of the RNA-guided homing mechanism to uncharacterized CAST subtypes, we chose to further study the previously identified type I-B CAST system ( Faure et al. 2019a 9. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Yan, W.X. ... CRISPR-Cas in mobile genetic elements: counter-defence and beyond Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :513-525 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peters et al. 2017 28. Peters, J.E. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Shmakov, S. ... Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). We searched for delocalized crRNAs in type I-B loci, but we could not detect any crRNAs, canonical or delocalized, that might enable homing. In contrast to type V-K and I-F CAST systems, type I-B subtype 1 (hereafter I-B1) CAST systems uniquely encode two TniQ proteins ( Figures 3 A and S3 A–S3D), and it was previously suggested that one might function with the Cascade complex to provide RNA-guided targeting whereas the other might recognize an attachment site ( Peters, 2019 26. Peters, J.E. Targeted transposition with Tn7 elements: safe sites, mobile plasmids, CRISPR/Cas and beyond Mol. Microbiol. 2019; 112 :1635-1644 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peters et al., 2017 28. Peters, J.E. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Shmakov, S. ... Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). These two TniQ proteins are more similar to prototypical Tn7 TnsD than those found in other CAST systems, suggesting that they likely evolved from a TnsD Tn7 ancestor ( Figures 3 B, 3C, S3 B, and S3C). Although these TniQ proteins are distinct in their C-terminal region, the strong similarity of the longer TniQ to prototypical Tn7 TnsD and the conserved location of type I-B1 CAST loci near glmS hint that the longer TniQ may facilitate DNA homing as a site-specific DNA-binding protein. Because of the strong similarity with Tn7 TnsD, we named the longer TniQ as TnsD. We therefore sought to investigate the functions of TnsD and TniQ and determine how I-B1 CAST systems achieve both RNA-guided and homing transposition, focusing on the I-B1 system from Anabaena variabilis (ATCC 29413, hereafter AvCAST).
We cloned the nine AvCAST-related genes ( tnsA , tnsB , tnsC , tniQ , cas6 , cas8 , cas7 , cas5 , and tnsD ) into a helper plasmid (pHelper) under IPTG-inducible promoters ( Figure 4 A; STAR Methods ). We cloned the predicted transposon right end (RE) and left end (LE) sequences ( Peters et al., 2017 28. Peters, J.E. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Shmakov, S. ... Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ) into a donor plasmid (pDonor) with a 0.5-kb cargo sequence. Two direct repeats from the AvCAST CRISPR array with appropriate spacers (i.e., the minimal CRISPR array) were further cloned into pHelper, and crRNA was expressed under an IPTG-inducible promoter. Small RNA-sequencing revealed that transcripts from the minimal CRISPR array are processed into 72-nt mature crRNAs ( Figure 4 B; Table S2 ).
Given that AvCAST likely requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) to recognize target DNA, we first targeted a plasmid (pTarget) library containing AvPSP1 flanked by a 6N motif upstream of the protospacer ( Strecker et al., 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). To clarify the role of AvCAST TniQ and TnsD in RNA-guided transposition, we targeted AvPSP1 with pHelper variants lacking either tniQ or tnsD ( Figure 4 A). We detected PAM-RE-cargo-LE (PAM-RL) insertion into the target plasmid by PCR when using pHelpers containing tniQ , and furthermore, removal of tnsD from the system increased the efficiency of transposition ( Figure 4 C). The other PAM-LE-cargo-RE (PAM-LR) direction insertions were confirmed by ddPCR ( Figure 4 D), indicating that the insertion direction is strongly biased (PAM-RL:PAM-LR = 54:1) in contrast to the type I-F system from Vibrio cholerae ( Klompe et al., 2019 19. Klompe, S.E. ∙ Vo, P.L.H. ∙ Halpin-Healy, T.S. ... Transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration Nature. 2019; 571 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). Deep sequencing analysis of the Δ tnsD condition confirmed the insertion of the RE into pTarget and revealed a preference for 5′ AT PAMs ( Figure 4 E). We next examined the position of the donor in pInsert products relative to AvPSP1, and we detected insertions mainly within an 80- to 86-bp window downstream of the PAM (43–49 bp downstream of the spacer) ( Figure 4 E). To investigate the exact structure of the pInsert, we performed long read, amplification-free nanopore sequencing. We found only simple insertions generated by type I-B1 AvCAST, whereas type V-K systems showed ~20% cointegrate insertions in this experimental context ( Figure 4 F, ( Strecker et al. 2020 34. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ... Response to Comment on “RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases” Science. 2020; 368 :eabb2920 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar )). We also confirmed the existence of target site duplications by Sanger sequencing of individual pInserts ( Figure 4 G). These results show AvCAST can perform RNA-guided transposition, and tniQ is necessary and sufficient for this activity.
To test whether AvCAST can target bacterial genomic DNA, we picked 36 PAM-containing targets (labeled AvPSP2-37) in E. coli . Two separate helper plasmids, pCascade (bearing cas6 , cas8 , cas7 , cas5 , and the minimal CRISPR array) and pTns (bearing tnsA , tnsB , tnsC , tniQ , and tnsD ) were co-electroporated into E. coli with pDonor. Although clear PCR amplicons were detected on the gel at only 10 out of the 36 sites (27.8%) ( Figure S4 A), 25 sites showed distinguishable signals compared to the no guide control condition by ddPCR ( Figure S4 B). Further confirmation by deep sequencing revealed that 33 sites showed insertions 70–100 bp downstream of the PAM (33–63 bp downstream of the spacer), as we observed prominent peaks in a 80- to 86-bp window downstream of the PAM (43–49 bp downstream of the spacer) in AvPSP1 targeting ( Figure S4 C). These results suggest that over 90% of guides are functional, with insertion frequencies between 0.02% and 2.45%. For three representative genomic sites (AvPSP2, AvPSP7, and AvPSP12), we performed tagmentation-based tag integration site sequencing (TTISS) ( Schmid-Burgk et al., 2020 31. Schmid-Burgk, J.L. ∙ Gao, L. ∙ Li, D. ... Highly Parallel Profiling of Cas9 Variant Specificity Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :794-800.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ) to determine the specificity of genome targeting by AvCAST. We observed comparable insertion efficiency with newly constructed heat-sensitive pSC101-donor and pDonor ( Figure S4 D), and confirmed that 98.8%, 99.8%, and 89.2% of the total insertion reads map to each expected target site (AvPSP2, AvPSP7, and AvPSP12, respectively) by TTISS ( Figure S4 E). This indicates that AvCAST can be reprogrammed to precisely insert DNA at specific sites in the E.coli genome.
Given that tnsD is dispensable for RNA-guided transposition, we tested the hypothesis that tnsD can mediate homing to the host glmS Tn7 attachment site ( attTn7 ) ( Waddell and Craig, 1989 36. Waddell, C.S. ∙ Craig, N.L. Tn7 transposition: recognition of the attTn7 target sequence Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :3958-3962 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). The native AvCAST contig (CP000117) and two other identical contigs (100% of sequence identity at the nucleotide level) show insertion 5 bp downstream of glmS gene stop codon, whereas all other homologous loci from diverse contigs (non-identical) are constantly inserted ~25 bp downstream of the end of glmS ( Figure S5 A). To examine whether AvCAST tnsD mediates homing to the A. variabilis glmS gene ( A.v. glmS ), we generated pTarget(AvCAST) containing the A.v. glmS sequence and AvPSP1 flanked by an AT PAM, which we used to assess the transposition efficiency. As we observed for PAM library plasmid targeting, removal of tnsD from the system increased insertion frequency at the AvPSP1 site, as quantified by ddPCR (3.0-fold) ( Figure 5 A). In contrast to RNA-guided transposition, tniQ is not necessary for Tn7-like transposition to the glmS site. Moreover, removal of tniQ from the system increased insertion frequency at the site (16.8-fold) ( Figures 5 B). We found that the prominent insertion site is 24 bp downstream of A.v. glmS gene ( Figure 5 C), which, although different from the native locus, is similar to other homologous loci. This insertion site was not affected by co-expression of Cascade and TniQ ( Figure 5 C). We then cloned the downstream region of glmS from the native contig into pTarget and repeated the transposition assays to determine if there are additional elements that govern insertion sites. We again observed a prominent insertion site at the canonical Tn7 insertion site, 25 bp downstream of glmS ( Figure 5 C), suggesting there are no additional elements. It is possible the locus found 5 bp downstream glmS in the native contig (CP000117) could result from a 20-bp microdeletion, an idea supported by the lack of target site duplications in this contig.
To obtain additional evidence that this homing transposition is mediated by Tn7-like machinery, we focused on the similarity between A. variabilis and E.coli glmS genes and assessed transposition into target plasmids harboring glmS mutations. As expected from the similarity, we observed an insertion 24 bp downstream of the E.coli glmS gene ( Figure S5 B). Similarly, expression of all Tn7-like machinery proteins with or without the Cascade complex induced transposition 25 bp downstream of glmS in the E. coli genome with target site duplications (TSDs) ( Figures S5 C–S5E). Based on previous findings about E.coli glmS attTn7 ( Mitra et al., 2010 23. Mitra, R. ∙ McKenzie, G.J. ∙ Yi, L. ... Characterization of the TnsD-attTn7 complex that promotes site-specific insertion of Tn7 Mob. DNA. 2010; 1 :18 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), we introduced single point mutations at 6 positions previously reported to be important for TnsD attachment and that are conserved between A. variabilis and E.coli glmS . We also constructed an additional 3 variants, two with double mutants and one with all six conserved sites mutated. Each of the six single point mutations in the A.v. glmS gene significantly impaired transposition, and both the double point mutants and the sextuple mutant completely abolished it ( Figure 5 D), suggesting that this homing transposition is achieved through recognition of attTn7 by AvCAST TnsD.
To further validate these observations, we reconstituted Tn7-like transposition of AvCAST in vitro ( Bainton et al., 1991 2. Bainton, R. ∙ Gamas, P. ∙ Craig, N.L. Tn7 transposition in vitro proceeds through an excised transposon intermediate generated by staggered breaks in DNA Cell. 1991; 65 :805-816 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 E). As expected, four Tn7 components ( tnsA , tnsB , tnsC , and tnsD ) ( Figure S5 F) and pDonor resulted in the transposition into a pTarget vector bearing the E. coli glmS Tn7 attachment site ( Figures 5 F and 5G).
We sought to investigate the generalizability of this homing mechanism by considering a second subtype of CAST I-B systems, subtype 2 (hereafter I-B2). In contrast to type I-B1, type I-B2 systems are not found at glmS in their native hosts, but are instead found next to tRNA genes (e.g., tRNA-Val and -Ala) ( Figures 3 A and S3 C), similar to type V-K CAST systems. Although type I-B1 and I-B2 share similar Cascade proteins (38% sequence identity, estimated from the concatenation of all Cas protein sequences), their transposon proteins have less than 10% sequence identity (concatenation of all Tn7 protein components). Moreover, although type I-B2 systems contain a TnsC protein and two TniQ proteins ( Figure S3 C), similar to I-B1 systems, they also harbor a fusion protein of TnsA and TnsB (hereafter TnsAB). Together, these findings suggest Cascade I-B was likely captured by two different transposons in evolutionarily independent events. Given these differences, we sought to determine the mechanisms used by these distinct systems. Among the putative I-B2 CAST systems, we focused on one from Peltigera membranacea cyanobiont 210A (PmcCAST) ( Figure 3 A) to investigate how it homes to tRNA genes. The PmcCAST locus encodes two TniQ proteins, with the larger TniQ protein having a weak but detectable similarity to Tn7 TnsD in its C-terminal region (HHpred probability is 99.26% with a sequence identity of 14%), indicating this protein (hereafter called TnsD) might be the homing selector target protein.
We cloned the eight PmcCAST genes ( tnsAB , tnsC , tniQ , tnsD , cas6 , cas8 , cas7 , and cas5 ) into a pHelper plasmid with a minimal CRISPR array. Predicted RE and LE sequences with 0.5-kb cargo were further cloned into pDonor. As described above, we targeted a PmcPSP1-containing 6N PAM library vector to concurrently identify the preferred PAM and insertion position of PmcCAST. We confirmed the expression of a 71-nt mature crRNA by RNA sequencing ( Figure S6 A; Table S2 ). Analysis of PmcCAST pInsert plasmids revealed single direction-biased insertions (PAM-RL:PAM-LR = 1:630) within an 83- to 92-bp window downstream of a strong ATG PAM (48–57 bp downstream of spacer) ( Figures 6 A, S6 B, and S6C). In contrast to type I-B1 AvCAST, we found cointegrate insertions by this type I-B2 PmcCAST, whose cointegrate ratio (17%) is comparable to that of type V-K ShCAST (20%) ( Strecker et al. 2020 34. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ... Response to Comment on “RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases” Science. 2020; 368 :eabb2920 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 B). We also confirmed the existence of target site duplications of individual pInserts ( Figure S6 D).
To examine the role of TniQ and TnsD in PmcCAST RNA-guided transposition and homing, we generated pTarget(PmcCAST) containing the host tRNA-Val gene and PmcPSP1 flanked by an ATG PAM. We targeted PmcPSP1 with pHelper and its variants lacking either tniQ or tnsD ( Figure 6 C). As with AvCAST, we again found that removal of tnsD from the system increased insertion frequency at the PmcPSP1 site, as quantified by ddPCR (14.5-fold) ( Figure 6 D). Expression of just the Tns proteins by pTns (bearing tnsAB , tnsC , tniQ , and tnsD ) also induced transposition on pTarget(PmcCAST), and deep sequencing analysis revealed that the prominent insertion site is 31 bp downstream of the tRNA-Val gene, consistent with where PmcCAST is located in the genome ( Figures 6 E and 6F). For this Tn7-like transposition of PmcCAST to the tRNA-Val homing site, TnsD is essential whereas TniQ is not necessary ( Figure 6 F). Reconstitution of Tn7-like transposition of PmcCAST in vitro ( Figure S6 E) validated that three protein components (TnsAB, TnsC, and TnsD) and pDonor resulted in the transposition into pTarget(PmcCAST) ( Figures 6 G and 6H). Thus, although the homing site is different, type I-B2 achieves RNA-guided transposition through the same mechanism used by type I-B1. The detection of high levels of cointegrate pInsert plasmids suggests that the TnsAB fusion of PmcCAST does not have the ability to process the 5′ ends of the transposon, instead facilitating copy-and-paste transposition into the target site.

Section: Discussion

The non-random occurrence of CAST insertions within bacterial genomes hints at mechanisms for directing transposition into conserved chromosomal sequences, or homing sites ( Figure 7 A). Here, we uncover two distinct ways by which CAST systems accomplish this task: V-K systems home using a dedicated delocalized crRNA, primarily to tRNA targets, whereas I-B systems utilize a dedicated tniQ/tnsD that mediates homing to glmS via direct DNA motif recognition in subtype 1 (similar to the prototypical Tn7) or to various tRNA genes in subtype 2 ( Figure 7 B). The use of an atypical crRNA expressed from outside of the CRISPR array in type V-K systems reveals remarkable similarity to type I-F CAST systems, which were discovered to also use a non-canonical crRNA to target homing sites ( Petassi et al., 2020 14. Petassi, M.T. ∙ Hsieh, S.-C. ∙ Peters, J.E. Guide RNA categorization enables target site choice in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas transposons Cell. 2020; 183 :1757-1771 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). This non-canonical crRNA features a variable repeat that is still able to form a hairpin for Cascade recognition and a full length or truncated spacer that can target homing sites despite numerous mismatches with the target. The similarities in these diverse CAST systems highlights the importance of transposon homing, and that in multiple instances, evolution has selected for an RNA-guided solution ( Figure S7 ). These likely ancient homing spacers have been shaped by evolution from their respective effectors, and shed light on a remarkable ability for target recognition.
The identification of a delocalized homing crRNA across almost all diverse type V-K CAST systems suggests that homing is a critical step in the life cycle of these systems, and the minimal functional length of both the direct repeat and spacer reveals strong pressure to retain effective targeting ability during evolution. The irregular spacing, and often separation, of the delocalized homing crRNA relative to the CRISPR array, and its divergent sequence features, implies different evolutionary constraints and possible acquisition mechanisms imparted by the self-targeting homing spacer and mobile element targeting spacers in the array. Consistent with this idea, we identified two CAST systems that have delocalized crRNA, but no detectable CRISPR arrays ( Figure 2 B). Why RNA-guided homing is programmed from outside the CRISPR array, and with different sequence features, remains an interesting question. One possibility, as identified in the type I-F systems, is that the delocalized spacer is competent for binding and transposition but does not allow for self-cleavage when in contact with nuclease-competent CRISPR systems ( Petassi et al., 2020 14. Petassi, M.T. ∙ Hsieh, S.-C. ∙ Peters, J.E. Guide RNA categorization enables target site choice in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas transposons Cell. 2020; 183 :1757-1771 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) However, a search of type V-K CAST systems in fully assembled genomes revealed no co-occurrence of other type V CRISPR systems, indicating that preventing crRNA cross-reactivity may not be a necessary function. We note that more comprehensive co-occurrence analysis is needed once complete genomic information is available for incomplete metagenomic type V-K loci to fully rule out this idea. Alternatively, we hypothesize that the sequence features of the delocalized crRNA could enable protection of the type V-K CAST host from self-cleavage by an ancestral Cas12 nuclease during initial co-option of this CRISPR system by the transposon.
The preference for homing to conserved genes and the ability to insert downstream of the target sequence (e.g., tRNA and glmS ) allows CAST systems to safely target numerous bacterial species without being deleterious to the host. The use of Cas protein-mediated RNA-guided targeting (that is known to tolerate a small number of mismatches between the RNA guide and its DNA target) of homing sites likely provides some flexibility to recognize variation across bacterial species.
The similarity of CAST I-B1 homing to prototypical Tn7 suggests a close evolutionary relationship and reveals a distinct strategy to integrate safely into chromosomes. Our finding that two separate subtypes of I-B use the same homing mechanism, but target different sites, further supports the notion that type I CRISPR-Cas systems were independently acquired by two distinct Tn7-like transposons.
Our results address a critical gap in our understanding of CAST systems, namely, why they are found at sites not targeted by their CRISPR arrays. We find that while some systems use an RNA-guided homing mechanism, others use a protein-targeted mechanism likely inherited from the transposon. Either one of these mechanisms allows CAST systems to insert themselves into host genomes by targeting well-conserved bacterial genes that serve as safe harbor attachment sites ( Figure 7 B). Thus, CAST systems seem to utilize two modes of insertion: transposition to mobile elements using RNA-guided targeting and homing using either RNA-guided targeting or the tniQ/tnsD pathway, like Tn7 transposons. How these pathways are regulated remains unclear in type V-K and type I-B CAST systems, but it was recently shown for type I-F that conserved transcription factors are linked to the switch between pathways ( Petassi et al., 2020 14. Petassi, M.T. ∙ Hsieh, S.-C. ∙ Peters, J.E. Guide RNA categorization enables target site choice in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas transposons Cell. 2020; 183 :1757-1771 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this observation, we can detect conserved transcription factors within CAST V-K and CAST I-B loci ( Figure 7 A) that appear to be distinct from cargo genes and could be linked to transposon pathway switching. Further analysis remains to be done to confirm they are pathway regulators. We also note our inability to detect expression of the homing crRNA in the cyanobacteria host S. hofmannii hinting at potential regulation. In addition to elucidating homing mechanisms, our work here experimentally characterizes the type I-B CAST systems and demonstrates that both subtypes of I-B CAST systems can transpose via RNA-guided targeting. Importantly, these type I-B CAST systems provide new starting points for developing genome engineering tools for targeted gene insertion in bacterial genomes ( Strecker et al. 2019 33.

Collectively, this work advances our understanding of the biology of these systems, highlighting conserved and divergent features, and shedding light on their mechanisms of action.
This study presents two unique targeting mechanisms that enable CAST systems to integrate at their chromosomal attachment sites and reveals two distinct pathways in the CAST life cycle: mobilization and homing. Further work will elucidate how CAST V-K and I-B systems regulate these two pathways. Although we can detect conserved transcription factors in CAST V-K and I-B loci, their role in CAST pathway regulation must be experimentally validated as has been done for CAST I-F systems ( Petassi et al., 2020 14. Petassi, M.T. ∙ Hsieh, S.-C. ∙ Peters, J.E. Guide RNA categorization enables target site choice in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas transposons Cell. 2020; 183 :1757-1771 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). How spacers are acquired for both mobilization and homing remains a mystery, because the adaptation module is notably absent in CAST loci. Finally, this study adds to the list of potential candidate systems that may be developed for targeted gene insertion applications (along with other CAST V-K and I-F systems) ( Strecker et al. 2019 33.

For transposition assays, E. coli strains were plated on LB-agar plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and IPTG and incubated at 37°C for 17 hours. For recovery of mature crRNAs and Tns proteins of I-B CAST systems, E.coli from a single colony were grown in Terrific Broth media (TB) at 37°C until OD600 reached 0.6, and further grown at 16°C with IPTG supplementation for expression. Culture for Trichormus variabilis followed the condition suggested by ATCC. Scytonema hofmanni (UTEX B 2349) and Anabaena cylindrica (PCC 7122) were cultured in BG-11 media at 25°C with light periodicity of 14 hours on, 10 hours off.
All plasmids used in this study are described in Table S2 . For ShCAST homing analysis, a tRNA target plasmid was cloned in the pACYC background by rejoining the chromosomal sequence up and downstream of the transposon. ShCAST pHelper plasmids (Addgene #127922) with endogenously driven tracrRNA were modified by replacing the previous FnPSP1 spacer with various crRNA driven by the J23117 promoter and flanked with the T7Te terminator using Gibson Assembly (NEB). The 24-nt 5′ extension and 14-nt 3′ extensions of the delocalized crRNA were taken from the natural host to match the length of crRNA derived from the CRISPR array. For sgRNA experiments targeting the E. coli genome, the pHelper_ShCAST_sgRNA plasmid (Addgene #127922) was modified by cloning spacers using Golden Gate assembly and LguI. For all RNA truncations, the length of crRNA or sgRNA spacer was reduced, and mismatches were generated with transversion mutations (A to T, T to A, G to C, C to G). All tested crRNA and sgRNA can be found in Table S2 . For AvCAST experiments, genes encoding TnsA-TnsB-TnsC-TniQ, TnsD and Cas6-Cas8-Cas7-Cas5 were amplified from the genome of Trichormus variabilis ( Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413). All the Tns genes were cloned into pCOLADuet-1 (Millipore) and the Cascade genes were cloned into pCDFDuet-1 (Millipore), resulting in pTns(AvCAST) and pCascade(AvCAST)_ ΔCRISPR, respectively using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (NEB). A pCascade was generated by inserting a tandem BsaI site flanked by two CRISPR direct repeats into pCascade(AvCAST)_ ΔCRISPR, and specific guides were further inserted by BsaI digestion and ligation. The Tns expression cassette in pTns(AvCAST) was inserted into pCascade(AvCAST) to obtain pHelper(AvCAST). For PmcCAST experiments, genes encoding ‘ Peltigera membranacea cyanobiont’ 210A TnsAB-TnsC-TnsD, TniQ, and Cas6-Cas8-Cas7-Cas5 were synthesized (Twist Bioscience) and cloned into pCDFDuet-1 with the appropriate spacer flanked by two CRISPR direct repeats described above. Gene fragments encoding both transposon ends (GENEWIZ) were cloned into pBluescript II SK (+), yielding pDonor(AvCAST) or pDonor(PmcCAST). For PAM screens, a 0.5kb exon fragment amplified from human EMX1 was inserted between the transposon ends as a mock non-functional cargo in E.coli . For other experiments, a chloramphenicol resistance gene (CmR) was used as cargo. To obtain pTns variants, the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) was used. For Nanopore sequencing experiments, all CAST components (DR-spacer-DR, Cascade, and Tns proteins) were cloned under a constitutive lac promoter to obtain pHelper2(AvCAST) and pHelper2(PmcCAST). The design of pR6K donors for AvCAST and PmcCAST followed that of pDonor_ShCAST_kanR (Addgene #127924). The glmS locus of BL21(DE3) (3800227-3801226, CP001509) was cloned into pUC19 (NEB). The glmS gene of A. variabilis and tRNA-Val gene of ‘ Peltigera membranacea cyanobiont’ 210A were cloned into pACYC vector bearing AvPSP1 or PmcPSP1 flanked by an AT or ATG PAM, respectively. These target plasmids were used as pTarget for in vitro transposition assays and also pTarget for assays in bacteria.
To identify the PAM of AvCAST and PmcCAST, 100 ng of randomized 6N sequence-containing pACYC vector libraries ( Strecker et al., 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ) was co-electroporated with 100 ng of both pHelper and pDonor into BL21(DE3) electrocompetent cells (Sigma). Cells were recovered for 1 hour and plated on 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, 50 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol containing LB-agar plates. After 37°C incubation for 17 hours, all colonies were scraped from the plates, and a portion was re-plated on 0.1 mM IPTG supplemented triple antibiotic LB-agar plates to induce protein expression. Cells were incubated for an additional 17 hours at 37°C. All colonies were scraped and plasmid DNAs were prepared from the colonies using the PureYield Plasmid Midiprep System (Promega). Insertion products containing the 6N sequence were amplified and sequenced using a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2, 300-cycle (Illumina). PAM and insert position were characterized using an established pipeline ( Strecker et al., 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For ShCAST, transposition in E.coli was performed by transformation of 20 ng each of pHelper, pTarget, and pDonor into TransforMax EC100 pir+ Electrocompetent E.coli (Lucigen). Cells were recovered for 1 hour and plated on ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol-containing plates. Cells were harvested 20 hours after plating, and scraped cells were lysed in 15 uL colony lysis buffer (TE with 0.1% Triton X-100). Genome targeting experiments were performed in a similar manner using pHelper and pDonor plasmids followed by plating on ampicillin and kanamycin. Cells were boiled for 5 min, diluted with 60 uL of water, spun at 4000 x g for 10 min to pellet debris, and the supernatant was used for subsequent analysis. The frequency of genome insertions relative to the concentration of extracted E.coli genomes or to the target plasmid was determined with qPCR as described above with a guide-specific forward primer and a primer/probe set in an unmodified region of the E.coli genome or the pTarget chloramphenicol resistance gene ( Table S2 ). The initial homing test for ShCAST was performed with a modified pHelper plasmid harboring a deletion of cas12k .
For AvCAST, 10 guides with 5′ AT PAMs were chosen in non-coding regions of the E. coli genome ( Strecker et al., 2019 33. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cloned into pCascade(AvCAST) ( Table S2 ). Each 100 ng of pCascade(AvCAST) targeting a specific genomic region was co-electroporated with pTns(AvCAST)_ΔTnsD and pDonor(AvCAST) into BL21(DE3) electrocompetent cells (Sigma) and plated on 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, 50 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin containing LB-agar plates. After 37°C incubation for 17 hours, all colonies were scraped from the plates, and a portion was re-plated on 0.1 mM IPTG supplemented triple antibiotic LB-agar plates to induce protein expression. Cells were incubated for an additional 17 hours at 37°C. All colonies were scraped and the gDNA was purified using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). Insertions were identified by PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche). The frequency of genome insertions was determined with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) as described below with 20 ng template gDNA for 20 μL ddPCR reaction.
Transposition assays for AvCAST and PmcCAST were performed by transformation of 30 ng each of pHelper2, pR6K Donor, and pTarget(AT/ATG+AvPSP1/PmcPSP1) into Pir1 E. coli . Cells were recovered for 1 hour at 37°C and plated on 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol containing LB-agar plates. Cells were harvested 5 days after incubation at room temperature, and subjected to mini-prep by QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN). Note that we avoided incubation at 37°C to prevent transposed products being actively resolved, which would mask replicative transposition. To recover transposed products, 100 ng mini-prep product was electroporated into Endura Competent Cells (Lucigen). Cells were recovered for 1 hour and plated on 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol containing LB-agar plates, and further incubated at room temperature for 5 days. Donor insertion on pTarget was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (position and target site duplication) of mini-prep products for 12 colonies. In parallel, all colonies were harvested and subjected to mini-prep, followed by amplification-free Nanopore sequencing library preparation (Oxford Nanopore Technologies SQK-LSK109). Briefly, mini-prep products were linearized by EcoRV, followed by end-prep and subsequent ligation of sequencing adapters. Resulting libraries were loaded on a MinION R9 flow cell and sequenced. Sequence reads containing 20 bp of AvPSP1/PmcPSP1 and both 20 bp of the outer transposon LE and RE were filtered for further analysis, thereby discarding short, low-quality, and contaminating gDNA reads.
Insertion events were quantified using insertion specific primers and a donor specific probe ( Table S2 ). ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP) (BioRad), primers (900 nM each), a probe (250 nM), and template DNA were combined into 20 μL reactions, and droplets were generated with 70 μL of Droplet Generation Oil for Probes (BioRad) using the QX200 Droplet Generator (BioRad). Thermal cycling conditions for ddPCR reactions were as follows: 1 cycle, 95°C, 10 min; 40 cycles, 94°C, 30 s, 58°C, 1 min; 1 cycle, 98°C, 10 mins; 4°C hold. PCR products were read with a QX200 Droplet Reader, and absolute concentrations of inserts were determined using QuantaSoft (v1.6.6.0320). Total template (genome or target plasmid) amount was also quantified through this process, and insertion frequency was calculated as inserts/template.
AvPSP2, 7, and 12 sites on the E.coli genome were targeted as mentioned above, with the following change: 100 ng of a temperature-sensitive pSC101-donor was used. After incubation on IPTG supplemented triple antibiotic LB-agar plates, cells were re-plated and grown for 12 hours at 43°C to prevent unintended amplification of donor plasmids in the following Tagmentation-based Tag Integration Site Sequencing (TTISS) analysis ( Schmid-Burgk et al., 2020 31. Schmid-Burgk, J.L. ∙ Gao, L. ∙ Li, D. ... Highly Parallel Profiling of Cas9 Variant Specificity Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :794-800.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genomic DNA was extracted from hundreds of colonies on a LB-agar Petri dish, and 500 ng genomic DNA (from approximate 10 8 E. coli cells) was tagmented with Tn5, and re-purified by Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Tagmented DNA samples were amplified using two rounds of PCR with KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Millipore) using a Tn5 adaptor-specific primer and nested primers within the DNA donor ( Table S2 ). The resulting libraries were sequenced using a NextSeq v2 kit, 75 cycle kit with 45 forward cycles and 30 reverse cycles. Read pairs with R1 containing the terminal 27 bp of the transposon RE sequence were filtered for further analysis and trimmed of the transposon sequence for alignment to the E. coli genome (CP001509). Filtered and trimmed reads were imported into Geneious Prime and aligned using the Geneious aligner with medium-low sensitivity, no fine-tuning, no structural variant, insertion, or deletion discovery enabled, and requiring paired reads to map nearby. The resulting SAM files were exported for further analysis. Aligned R1 reads with length of 18 bp (remaining R1 length after trimming of 27 bp of transposon sequence) and SAM flags 99 (insertion position = POS field) or 147 (insertion position = POS field + trimmed R1 length of 18 bp) were used to determine the transposon insertion position. Reads with an insertion position 50-100-bp downstream of the PAM were considered on-target, whereas remaining reads were counted as off-targets.
Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosytems) using 20 uL reactions, 2 uL input of extracted nucleic acid, 900 nM forward primer, 900 nM reverse primer, and 250 nM of probe. Reactions were quantified using the LightCycler 480 Instrument (Roche).
To recover mature RNAs of AvCAST and PmcCAST, each pCascade(AvCAST, AvPSP1 spacer) and pCascade(PmcCAST, PmcPSP1 spacer) was transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL Competent Cells (Agilent 230280). A 10-mL culture was grown in Terrific Broth media (TB) supplemented with 50 μg/ml spectinomycin at 37°C with shaking at 150 rpm until an OD600 of 0.6 was reached. Cascade and crRNA expression was induced by supplementation with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The cells were incubated at 16°C for 16 h, and then harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C at 4000 rpm. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol-chloroform (ZYMO RESEARCH) and DNaseI treatment. Ribosomal RNAs were removed by Ribominus Transcriptome Isolation Kit (Invitrogen), and the remaining RNA was treated with 5′ terminator exonuclease, T4 Polynucleotide Kinase, RNA 5′ polyphosphatase, and used as input for NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB). Prepared libraries were sequenced using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2, 75 cycles. Paired-end reads were aligned to their respective reference expression plasmid sequences using BWA. Resulting transcript sequences were analyzed using Geneious Prime.
TnsA, B, C, and D of AvCAST and TnsAB, C, and D of PmcCAST were individually cloned into ColE1-based pTwinStrep-SUMO bacterial expression vectors. Each vector was transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL Competent Cells. A 5-mL starter culture was grown in TB supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 12 h, which was used to inoculate 4 L of TB for growth at 37°C with shaking at 150 rpm until an OD600 of 0.6 was reached. Protein expression was induced by supplementation with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The cells were incubated at 16°C for 16 h for protein expression, and then harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 4°C at 4000 rpm (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E, rotor JLA9.100). Cell pellets were stored at −80°C for later purification. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0) supplemented with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Millipore Sigma 4693116001). Cells were disrupted using the LM20 Microfluidizer system at 18,000 PSI. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 4°C at 9500 rpm (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E, rotor JLA-10.500). The cleared lysate was applied to 2 mL of packed Strep -Tactin Superflow Plus (QIAGEN 30004) and incubated with rotation for 1 h, followed by washing of the protein-bound beads in 50 mL of lysis buffer. The bound SUMO-tagged proteins were eluted in 10 mL of lysis buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin (Sigma). The eluted proteins were further digested by Ulp1 SUMO protease at 4°C for 16 h. Resulting Tns proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore), and protein concentration was estimated by NuPAGE (Invitrogen) and eStain L1 Protein Staining System (GenScript). The concentrated protein was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5) via FPLC. The resulting fractions from gel filtration were analyzed, and the fractions containing the protein were pooled, snap frozen as 1 mg/mL aliquots, and stored at −80°C. In vitro transposition reactions were carried out with 200 nM of each Tns protein, 100 ng of pDonor(AvCAST)_CmR, and 100 ng of pTarget for AvCAST in vitro ( E. coli - glmS) in a final reaction buffer of 26 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 μg/mL BSA, 2 mM ATP, 2.1 mM DTT, 0.05 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 21 mM KCl, 1% glycerol supplemented with 15 mM Mg(OAc)2 based on in vitro Tn7 reaction protocol ( Bainton et al., 1991 2. Bainton, R. ∙ Gamas, P. ∙ Craig, N.L. Tn7 transposition in vitro proceeds through an excised transposon intermediate generated by staggered breaks in DNA Cell. 1991; 65 :805-816 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total reaction volumes were 20 uL, and reactions were incubated for 2 hours at 30°C. For PmcCAST, pDonor(PmcCAST)_CmR and pTarget for PmcCAST (bearing ATG+PmcPSP1 and tRNA-Val) were used. The resulting products were purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), followed by diagnostic PCR.
We searched for new CAST loci using type I-F, I-B, and V-K components in prokaryotic and metagenomic databases (nucleotide sequence available in August 2019 in NCBI database restricted to Prokaryotic sequences WGS and GenBank, and MG-RAST) ( Keegan et al., 2016 18. Keegan, K.P. ∙ Glass, E.M. ∙ Meyer, F. MG-RAST, a Metagenomics Service for Analysis of Microbial Community Structure and Function Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1399 :207-233 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, we identified contigs where CAST components (TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TniQ/TnsD plus Cascade IB, and TnsB, TnsC, TniQ plus Cas12k) are colocalized to form a full CAST locus (CAST-IB: TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TniQ/TnsD plus Cascade IB; CAST-IV: TnsB, TnsC, TniQ plus Cas12k) within a 50-kb region using tblastn (bitscore superior or equal to 30) ( Altschul et al., 1990 1.

Biol. 1990; 215 :403-410 Crossref Scopus (76844) PubMed Google Scholar ) from each CAST component extracted from previous literature ( Faure et al., 2019a 9. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Yan, W.X. ... CRISPR-Cas in mobile genetic elements: counter-defence and beyond Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :513-525 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peters et al., 2017 28.

USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, we extracted each CAST component from all contigs, clustered them by protein type (TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TniQ/TnsD, Cas6Ib, Cas7b, Cas8b, Cas5b, Cas12k) and by sequence similarity using mmseqs2 ( Steinegger and Söding, 2017 32. Steinegger, M. ∙ Söding, J. MMseqs2 enables sensitive protein sequence searching for the analysis of massive data sets Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :1026-1028 Crossref Scopus (1377) PubMed Google Scholar ) (50 percent of sequences identity 50 percent of coverage), aligned members together within each clusters using mafft-einsi ( Katoh et al., 2005 16. Katoh, K. ∙ Kuma, K. ∙ Toh, H. ... MAFFT version 5: improvement in accuracy of multiple sequence alignment Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :511-518 Crossref Scopus (3994) PubMed Google Scholar ), and created a hmm profile for each cluster using hmmer ( Eddy, 2009 6. Eddy, S.R. A new generation of homology search tools based on probabilistic inference Genome Inform. 2009; 23 :205-211 Crossref Scopus (995) PubMed Google Scholar ; Katoh et al., 2005 16. Katoh, K. ∙ Kuma, K. ∙ Toh, H. ... MAFFT version 5: improvement in accuracy of multiple sequence alignment Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :511-518 Crossref Scopus (3994) PubMed Google Scholar ). From these profiles, we searched for additional contigs where CAST components (TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TniQ/TnsD plus Cascade IB, and TnsB, TnsC, TniQ plus Cas12k) are colocalized within a 50-kb region using hmmsearch (bitscore superior or equal to 30) against a translated version of our nucleotide database. For each CAST locus, we predicted gene boundaries using prodigal version 2.6.3 (model meta) ( Hyatt et al., 2010 13. Hyatt, D. ∙ Chen, G.-L. ∙ Locascio, P.F. ... Prodigal: prokaryotic gene recognition and translation initiation site identification BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11 :119 Crossref Scopus (6812) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Cas profiles database ( Makarova et al., 2020 21.

Microbiol. 2020; 18 :67-83 Crossref Scopus (1370) PubMed Google Scholar ). We predicted CRISPR arrays using minced software ( https://github.com/ctSkennerton/minced ) (minimum repeat size 16, maximum repeat size 50, minimum spacer size 20, maximum spacer size 50). We predicted tRNA and other ncRNA using tRNA-ScanSE version 2 ( Chan and Lowe, 2019 5. Chan, P.P. ∙ Lowe, T.M. tRNAscan-SE: Searching for tRNA Genes in Genomic Sequences Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (1000) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Infernal version 1.1.3 ( Chan and Lowe, 2019 5.

Transposon ends were determined manually on Geneious framework ( Kearse et al., 2012 17. Kearse, M. ∙ Moir, R. ∙ Wilson, A. ...

Evol. 2009; 26 :1641-1650 Crossref Scopus (3501) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the following methodology. We searched for repeat segments of 10 nucleotides with a maximum of 3 mismatched nucleotides and looked for inverted repeats embedding both the transposon components and the Cas components. For every candidate, we used the opposite inverted repeat and ran a similar search. We looked for two blocks of inverted clustered repeats that embed CAST components and validated the ends when possible by searching for the duplication site on both sides of the transposon. If no candidate was found with this repeat search method, we used blastn-short ( Altschul et al., 1990 1. Altschul, S.F. ∙ Gish, W. ∙ Miller, W. ... Basic local alignment search tool J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215 :403-410 Crossref Scopus (76844) PubMed Google Scholar ) (word side = 7) to initially identify repeats, and performed the same downstream strategy to find the transposon’s ends. The structural comparison of TniQ was performed under PyMOL framework version 1.2 (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, LLC) and using Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis ( Callebaut et al., 1997 4. Callebaut, I. ∙ Labesse, G. ∙ Durand, P. ... Deciphering protein sequence information through hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA): current status and perspectives Cell. Mol.

Identification of hidden relationships from the coupling of hydrophobic cluster analysis and domain architecture information Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :1726-1733 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phylogenetic trees were built with FastTree ( Price et al., 2009 29. Price, M.N. ∙ Dehal, P.S. ∙ Arkin, A.P. FastTree: computing large minimum evolution trees with profiles instead of a distance matrix Mol. Biol. Evol. 2009; 26 :1641-1650 Crossref Scopus (3501) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Whelan And Goldman model (WAG model) and visualized with iTOL ( Letunic and Bork, 2007 20. Letunic, I. ∙ Bork, P. Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL): an online tool for phylogenetic tree display and annotation Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :127-128 Crossref Scopus (2268) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The number and definition of replicates for each experiment can be found in the corresponding figure legend. To quantitatively define PAM preference, insertion read counts stratified by the PAM sequence at the 6N randomized library position were normalized by abundance of the corresponding PAM in the input library. PAMs displaying greater than 16-fold enrichment in abundance compared to the input library were input into WebLogo ( https://weblogo.berkeley.edu/ ) to obtain the corresponding sequence logo. Sequencing data was converted to coverage maps using Geneious Prime and its built-in Geneious aligner. All remaining quantitative data was processed and visualized using GraphPad Prism.

Archive (5.34 MB) Data S1. CAST loci, related to STAR Methods Annotated CAST loci from V-K, I-B subtype 1, and I-B subtype 2 in GenBank format. Each locus is centered on the tniQ gene, which is annotated as “Center.” All loci have a unique TniQ/TnsD protein: all loci with identical TniQ/TnsD proteins were discarded to keep one representative with longest distance to the edges of the contig. The centered tniQ/tnsD is surrounded by a maximum of 50-kb upstream and downstream (or less if the locus is near the edge of a contig). A padding was used when the centered tniQ/tnsD was near the contig edge. Proteins are annotated from Pfam or Cas profile database (annotated Protein, or CAS_CRISPR). Tn7 components are annotated as Tns_tni. Proteins sharing at least 50% sequence identity have a “Clu” annotation followed by a unique number. tRNA and other ncRNAs are annotated under tRNA and RNA.
