Title: Mucus-degrading Bacteroides link carbapenems to aggravated graft-versus-host disease


Abstract: Summary

The intestinal microbiota is an important modulator of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which often complicates allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems increase the risk for intestinal GVHD, but mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that treatment with meropenem, a commonly used carbapenem, aggravates colonic GVHD in mice via the expansion of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT). BT has a broad ability to degrade dietary polysaccharides and host mucin glycans. BT in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice demonstrated upregulated expression of enzymes involved in the degradation of mucin glycans. These mice also had thinning of the colonic mucus layer and decreased levels of xylose in colonic luminal contents. Interestingly, oral xylose supplementation significantly prevented thinning of the colonic mucus layer in meropenem-treated mice. Specific nutritional supplementation strategies, including xylose supplementation, may combat antibiotic-mediated microbiome injury to reduce the risk for intestinal GVHD in allo-HSCT patients.

Section: Introduction

The intestinal microbiota can interact with the host immune system ( Hooper et al., 2012 25. Hooper, L.V. ∙ Littman, D.R. ∙ Macpherson, A.J. Interactions between the microbiota and the immune system Science. 2012; 336 :1268-1273 Crossref Scopus (3160) PubMed Google Scholar ), including in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Patients undergoing allo-HSCT are at risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a life-threatening inflammatory process where allogeneic donor T cells recognize recipient tissues as foreign. The composition of the intestinal microbiome has been an important modulator of GVHD ( Jenq et al., 2012 26. Jenq, R.R. ∙ Ubeda, C. ∙ Taur, Y. ... Regulation of intestinal inflammation by microbiota following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :903-911 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the lower intestinal tract, commensal microbes are dependent on diet- and host-derived metabolic substrates ( Ley et al., 2008 33. Ley, R.E. ∙ Lozupone, C.A. ∙ Hamady, M. ... Worlds within worlds: evolution of the vertebrate gut microbiota Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6 :776-788 Crossref Scopus (1225) PubMed Google Scholar ). They then participate in the digestion and also modulate both local and systemic immunity. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often used in this patient population to treat infections. They have been found, however, to increase the risk for intestinal GVHD, possibly via bystander depletion of beneficial commensal bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract has been identified as a primary target of allogeneic donor T cells in allo-HSCT, and intestinal GVHD often serves to amplify systemic inflammation ( Hill and Ferrara, 2000 23. Hill, G.R. ∙ Ferrara, J.L. The primacy of the gastrointestinal tract as a target organ of acute graft-versus-host disease: rationale for the use of cytokine shields in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation Blood. 2000; 95 :2754-2759 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, intestinal microbiome injury following allo-HSCT is consistently and reproducibly associated with GVHD-related mortality and reduced overall survival ( Jenq et al . , 2012 26. Jenq, R.R. ∙ Ubeda, C. ∙ Taur, Y. ... Regulation of intestinal inflammation by microbiota following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :903-911 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ; Taur et al., 2014 57. Taur, Y. ∙ Jenq, R.R. ∙ Perales, M.A. ...

In allo-HSCT, major microbiome shifts are seen in association with antibiotic administration ( Holler et al., 2014 24. Holler, E. ∙ Butzhammer, P. ∙ Schmid, K. ... Metagenomic analysis of the stool microbiome in patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation: loss of diversity is associated with use of systemic antibiotics and more pronounced in gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease Biol.

Certain classes of antibiotics, including carbapenems, are particularly associated with increased intestinal GVHD ( Elgarten et al., 2021 18. Elgarten, C.W. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Getz, K.D. ...

Increased GVHD-related mortality with broad-spectrum antibiotic use after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in human patients and mice Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :339ra71 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intestinal microbiota, especially Clostridia, serve an important function in maintaining intestinal homeostasis ( Atarashi et al., 2011 3. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Shima, T. ... Induction of colonic regulatory T cells by indigenous Clostridium species Science. 2011; 331 :337-341 Crossref Scopus (2957) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mathewson et al., 2016 37. Mathewson, N.D. ∙ Jenq, R. ∙ Mathew, A.V. ... Gut microbiome-derived metabolites modulate intestinal epithelial cell damage and mitigate graft-versus-host disease Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :505-513 Crossref Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether a loss of Clostridia during carbapenem therapy is mechanistically sufficient to aggravate intestinal GVHD is not known. In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of meropenem, a commonly used carbapenem in allo-HSCT patients, on mice undergoing allo-HSCT. We found that meropenem treatment aggravated GVHD primarily in the colon and that a prominent effect on the colonic microbiota was the expansion of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT). BT is a Gram-negative obligate anaerobe with a versatile range of metabolic substrates, including dietary fiber polysaccharides and host-derived mucus O-glycans. Meropenem-treated mice developed a thinned colonic mucus layer and bacterial translocation into mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). We found that expression of mucolytic enzymes by BT was increased in meropenem-treated mice and that the colonic lumen in these mice had altered levels of carbohydrates, including xylose. Supplementation with xylose, in meropenem-treated mice, resulted in a significantly thicker mucus layer without changing BT abundance. Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics are important for treating infections in allo-HSCT patients but can lead to expansion and altered behavior of commensal bacteria, which in turn can contribute to increased severity of GVHD.

Section: Results

At our center, institutional guidelines for treating neutropenic fever recommend first-line therapy with cefepime, an antibiotic that is relatively sparing of commensal anaerobes, and second-line therapy with meropenem, which is highly active against commensal anaerobes. We asked whether the use of meropenem was associated with a difference in incidence of intestinal GVHD. Hence, we retrospectively examined 295 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent allo-HSCT with tacrolimus and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis, following conditioning therapy with fludarabine and busulfan at our institution from 2011 to 2016. We evaluated the incidence of acute intestinal GVHD until day 100 after transplant and compared patients who received neither cefepime nor meropenem, those who received cefepime alone, those who received meropenem alone, and those who received both cefepime and meropenem during the period from days −10 to 30 relative to allo-HSCT. A summary of clinical characteristics is provided in Table S1 ; there were no significant differences between the groups. Interestingly, the incidence of acute intestinal GVHD was significantly higher in patients who received either meropenem alone or both cefepime and meropenem, whereas the acute intestinal GVHD incidence in patients receiving only cefepime was similar to that of patients who received neither antibiotic ( Figure 1 A). These results indicate that meropenem exposure in allo-HSCT patients is associated with an increased incidence of acute intestinal GVHD.
To further explore a potential relationship between meropenem and intestinal GVHD, we examined the effects of meropenem on GVHD in a mouse model of allo-HSCT. We began with developing a feasible method of administering meropenem to mice that would better mimic the effects of meropenem on the intestinal microbiome of patients. We quantified meropenem concentrations in the cecal lumen of mice 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 h after subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous injection produced an increase in meropenem concentrations in the cecum at 4 h after injection, which rapidly declined afterward ( Figure S1 A), indicating that daily or even twice-daily dosing in mice was unlikely to produce stable intestinal luminal concentrations of meropenem in mice. We then evaluated drinking water as a means of continuously administering meropenem to mice, using bacterial density quantified by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene quantitative PCR (qPCR) to gauge reductions in the intestinal microbiota. We selected a concentration of 0.625 g/L meropenem, which produced a detectable meropenem concentration in fecal samples (median ± SEM, 0.11 ± 0.07 μg/g stool) and a substantial one-log reduction in fecal bacterial density, as an experimental drinking water dose ( Figure S1 B).
Lethally irradiated B6D2F1 (H-2 b/d ) mice were intravenously injected with 5 × 10 6 bone marrow (BM) cells and 5 × 10 6 splenocytes from major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched B6 (H-2 b ) or syngeneic donors on day 0. Throughout this manuscript, we refer to mice at high risk of GVHD after receiving allogeneic donor-derived cells as “allogeneic mice,” whereas mice at no risk of GVHD after receiving syngeneic donor-derived cells are referred to as “syngeneic mice.” Meropenem was administered to allogeneic mice in the drinking water from days 3 to 15 relative to allo-HSCT infusion ( Figure 1 B). We found that mice treated with meropenem after allo-HSCT had significantly worsened survival ( Figure 1 C), with severe epithelial damage in the colon ( Figure 1 D) and significantly higher GVHD histological scores in the colon, compared with control allogeneic mice ( Figure 1 E). By contrast, GVHD histology in the small intestine and liver was not substantially different in allogeneic mice treated with meropenem ( Figures 1 D and 1E). This indicates that meropenem primarily aggravates colonic GVHD.
Studies in the pediatric allo-HSCT population and in mice have found that intestinal Clostridia are associated with protection from GVHD ( Simms-Waldrip et al., 2017 50. Simms-Waldrip, T.R. ∙ Sunkersett, G. ∙ Coughlin, L.A. ... Antibiotic-induced depletion of anti-inflammatory clostridia is associated with the development of graft-versus-host disease in pediatric stem cell transplantation patients Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. 2017; 23 :820-829 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Corroborating this, Clostridia are known to be producers of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyrate, which play a role in maintaining epithelial integrity in murine GVHD ( Mathewson et al., 2016 37. Mathewson, N.D. ∙ Jenq, R. ∙ Mathew, A.V. ... Gut microbiome-derived metabolites modulate intestinal epithelial cell damage and mitigate graft-versus-host disease Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :505-513 Crossref Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ). We asked if meropenem-treated allogeneic mice showed a loss of Clostridia abundance and a reduction in SCFA levels. In this regard, we found that on day 7, or 4 days following the start of meropenem treatment, Clostridia were indeed depleted and remained so at 6 days after stopping meropenem ( Figure S1 C). These mice also had reduced fecal levels of SCFAs, with particularly dramatic reductions in butyrate and valerate ( Figure S1 D).
Next, we evaluated the effects of other antibiotics on colonic GVHD. Levofloxacin, cefepime, or meropenem was administered to allogeneic mice in the drinking water from days 3 to 15 relative to allo-HSCT infusion ( Figure S2 A). We found that allogeneic mice treated with levofloxacin or cefepime experienced colonic GVHD that was similar in severity to control allogeneic mice ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Consistent with this, we found that allogeneic mice treated with levofloxacin or cefepime did not show substantially reduced fecal levels of SCFAs, including in particular butyrate and valerate ( Figure S2 D).
To determine whether a loss of Clostridia during meropenem treatment is mechanistically sufficient to aggravate intestinal GVHD, we examined the effects of intestinal microbiome decontamination in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice. To do so, we administered, in addition to meropenem, an oral cocktail of piperacillin/tazobactam and nystatin in the drinking water from days 5 to 15 after transplantation ( Figure 1 F), similarly to a regimen given to pediatric allo-HSCT patients ( Bekker et al., 2019 4. Bekker, V. ∙ Zwittink, R.D. ∙ Knetsch, C.W. ... Dynamics of the gut microbiota in children receiving selective or total gut decontamination treatment during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. 2019; 25 :1164-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacterial density was significantly reduced by this cocktail ( Figure 1 G). Interestingly, we observed that intestinal decontamination improved survival in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice ( Figure 1 H), suggesting that meropenem treatment leads to worsened GVHD not only due to the depletion of beneficial bacteria but also via the expansion of pro-inflammatory bacteria.
We then sought to characterize the effects of meropenem on the composition of the colonic microbiota of allo-HSCT patients and mice. We collected fecal specimens from 44 patients who were treated with allo-HSCT, following conditioning with fludarabine and busulfan at our center from 2014 to 2019. Of these patients, 26 did not receive and 18 did receive meropenem treatment between days −10 and 14. Among meropenem-untreated patients, all patients were treated with cefepime, except for one patient treated with ceftazidime and two treated with levofloxacin alone. A comparison of clinical characteristics demonstrated no significant differences between these groups ( Table S2 ). We examined fecal samples collected at baseline following hospital admission around day −7 as well as on day 14 following allo-HSCT ( Figure 2 A). Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) testing of weighted UniFrac beta diversity measures, we found that at baseline, meropenem-untreated and -treated patients were not significantly different, nor were they different on day 14 ( Figures S3 A and S3B), likely reflecting a high degree of individual patient intestinal microbiota heterogeneity that has been seen previously in this population and has been attributed to prior antibiotic treatments as well as variable nutrition ( Peled et al., 2020 40. Peled, J.U. ∙ Gomes, A.L.C. ∙ Devlin, S.M. ... Microbiota as predictor of mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :822-834 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ). To better characterize microbiome effects of antibiotics in our relatively small and heterogeneous cohort, we performed a paired differential abundance analysis, asking which bacterial genera were the most changed from baseline in the two subgroups of patients. This approach demonstrated that patients treated with meropenem showed significant expansion of bacteria from the genus Bacteroides ( Figures 2 A–2C and S3 C). By contrast, patients not treated with meropenem showed expansion of the genus Enterococcus , a genus belonging to Erysipelotrichaceae, and the genus UBA1819 , but not of Bacteroides ( Figures 2 A, 2C, 2E, and S3 C).
We next asked if meropenem treatment had similar effects on the composition of the intestinal microbiota of allogeneic mice ( Figure 2 F). Using 16S rRNA gene qPCR, we quantified fecal bacterial densities and found that meropenem-treated allogeneic mice showed significantly decreased bacterial density on day 14 during meropenem treatment, but by day 21, or 6 days after stopping meropenem, fecal bacterial densities had recovered to a level similar to that of untreated syngeneic and allogeneic mice ( Figure 2 G). Most allogeneic mice treated with meropenem began to succumb to aggravated GVHD approximately 3 weeks after allo-HSCT ( Figure 1 C), and so we characterized the fecal microbiome on day 21 and found that alpha diversity, quantified using the inverse Simpson index, was significantly reduced in meropenem-treated mice ( Figure 2 H). PERMANOVA testing demonstrated significant compositional differences between meropenem-untreated and -treated allogeneic mice ( Figure 2 I). We found that meropenem treatment led to significantly higher abundances of bacteria from several genera, including most substantially Bacteroides , as well as Enterococcus , Erysipelatoclostridium , Bifidobacterium , and Akkermansia ( Figures 2 J–2L). Simultaneously, many genera were depleted, including Blautia , Lachnoclostridium , and other members of Lachnospiraceae , which belong to the class Clostridia ( Figures 2 J and 2K).
Next, we examined the effects of meropenem treatment on Bacteroides subsets, which is achievable to a degree when sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene ( Jovel et al., 2016 27. Jovel, J. ∙ Patterson, J. ∙ Wang, W. ... Characterization of the gut microbiome using 16S or shotgun metagenomics Front. Microbiol. 2016; 7 :459 Crossref Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified a single Bacteroides sequence variant that was significantly expanded in meropenem-treated mice and found it had 100% identity with the 16S rRNA sequences of BT, Bacteroides faecis , and Bacteroides faecichinchillae , whereas other Bacteroides strains had 98.8% identity or less ( Figure 3 A). We isolated the predominant murine Bacteroides isolate and confirmed by whole-genome sequencing that it was a strain of BT, with 97.4% genomic identity to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)-type strain of BT (ATCC 29148) and only 89.2% and 80.8% genomic identity to Bacteroides faecis and Bacteroides faecichinchillae , respectively. We have named this isolate “MDA-JAX BT001” or “murine BT.” Interestingly, murine BT was not eliminated on days 7 and 14 by meropenem-supplemented drinking water and quickly expanded after cessation of meropenem therapy in most meropenem-treated mice, in contrast to Clostridia that consistently remained depleted ( Figures 3 B and S1 C). These findings suggested that murine BT was less sensitive to meropenem than Clostridia.
We evaluated this hypothesis by quantifying the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of meropenem against several bacterial isolates ( Table S3 ). Both mouse- and human-derived (ATCC 29148) BT strains showed only moderate sensitivity to meropenem with MICs of 4 and 6 μg/mL, respectively. Mouse-derived Enterococcus faecalis (MDA-JAX EF001) was more resistant with an MIC of 12 μg/mL, whereas mouse-derived Clostridium disporicum (MDA-JAX CD001), Clostridium saudiense (MDA-JAX CS001), and Lachnospiraceae unclassified (MDA-JAX LS001), which belong to the class Clostridia, had MICs of 0.094, 0.38, and 0.38 μg/mL, respectively, showing high sensitivity. Stool collected 48 h after starting meropenem treatment in normal specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice had a meropenem concentration of 0.11 ± 0.07 μg/g. These data suggested that BT can survive during meropenem treatment and then can have a selective advantage after discontinuation of meropenem.
We then asked if a loss of Clostridia and an increased abundance of BT could be observed following treatment with other antibiotics. To this end, we administered levofloxacin, cefepime, or meropenem to mice with GVHD, as in Figure S2 A. Levofloxacin-treated mice had significantly higher abundances of Clostridia, compared with meropenem-treated mice ( Figures S4 A and S4B), and this difference was consistent with fecal butyrate levels ( Figure S2 D). Additionally, both levofloxacin- and cefepime-treated mice had significantly lower abundances of BT, compared with meropenem-treated mice ( Figures S4 A and S4C). These results indicate that meropenem is more disruptive of the microbiota, specifically with respect to the loss of Clostridia and increased abundance of BT.
To further evaluate for an association between murine BT and aggravated GVHD in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice, we retrospectively stratified mice from 3 experiments, shown in Figure 1 C, by their median relative abundance of BT. A comparison of these two cohorts showed that mice with higher abundances of BT had worsened overall survival ( Figure 3 C). Next, we experimentally studied the effects of murine BT on GVHD severity. In meropenem-treated allogeneic mice that had completed treatment with a decontamination cocktail, we orally inoculated 2 × 10 7 colony-forming units (CFUs) of murine BT and monitored GVHD severity and survival ( Figure 3 D). Strikingly, we found that allogeneic mice inoculated with murine BT showed worsened survival ( Figure 3 E), with severe epithelial damage and significantly higher GVHD histological scores in the colon, compared with those without murine BT inoculation ( Figures 3 F and 3G), indicating that murine BT was sufficient to aggravate GVHD in allogeneic mice that had been previously decontaminated.
The composition of the intestinal microbiota is known to vary spatially, including longitudinally from proximal to distal, as well as radially from the luminal center to the mucosal surface. The mucosal surface under normal conditions is enriched with bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes, including Clostridia, and other intestinal bacteria are relatively excluded, including those belonging to Bacteroidaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Lactobacillaceae, which are enriched in the luminal contents ( Nava and Stappenbeck, 2011 38. Nava, G.M. ∙ Stappenbeck, T.S. Diversity of the autochthonous colonic microbiota Gut Microbes. 2011; 2 :99-104 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). We asked how meropenem treatment can impact on the radial composition of the microbiota. Hence, we collected paired mucosal and fecal pellet samples and evaluated the bacterial composition as previously reported ( Donaldson et al., 2020 16. Donaldson, G.P. ∙ Chou, W.C. ∙ Manson, A.L. ... Spatially distinct physiology of Bacteroides fragilis within the proximal colon of gnotobiotic mice Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :746-756 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A). In normal mice, beta diversity analysis identified significant compositional differences between luminal and mucosal samples, and the Bacteroidia-to-Clostridia ratio was significantly higher in luminal samples than mucosal samples ( Figures 4 B and 4C). This indicated that Clostridia are enriched in the mucosal surface, whereas Bacteroidia, including BT, are enriched in luminal contents at the steady state. Interestingly, we found significant compositional differences between luminal and mucosal samples in allogeneic mice (PERMANOVA testing, p = 0.02; coefficient in the linear model, R 2 = 0.30), whereas meropenem-treated allogeneic mice showed the loss of such differences (PERMANOVA testing, p = 0.4; coefficient in the linear model, R 2 = 0.13) ( Figure 4 D). We also evaluated beta diversity distances between paired luminal and mucosal samples collected from individual mice and found that these were reduced in allogeneic mice treated with meropenem, corroborating our other analyses ( Figure 4 E). Finally, samples from allogeneic mice showed a significant difference in the Bacteroidia-to-Clostridia ratio when comparing luminal samples with mucosal samples, whereas meropenem-treated allogeneic mice had lost this difference ( Figure 4 F). We then evaluated the effects on radial compositional differences with other antibiotics. Cefepime-treated allogeneic mice showed a loss of compositional differences between luminal and mucosal samples (PERMANOVA testing, p = 0.7; coefficient in the linear model, R 2 = 0.05) similarly to that seen in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice, whereas levofloxacin-treated mice showed less disruption (PERMANOVA testing, p = 0.1; coefficient in the linear model, R 2 = 0.17) ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Together, these data indicated that in allogeneic mice, the normal enrichment of Clostridia at the mucosal surface was preserved. Meropenem treatment, however, led to a disruption of this enrichment, with high relative abundances of Bacteroides seen in mucosal samples. These results are consistent with the possibility that Clostridia function to exclude Bacteroidia from the mucosal surface and that in the setting of reduced Clostridia secondary to eradication by meropenem treatment, Bacteroidia are then able to opportunistically colonize the mucosal surface.
BT is a Gram-negative obligate anaerobe with a broad ability to degrade dietary polysaccharides as well as host-derived glycans, including mucins ( Bergstrom and Xia, 2013 6. Bergstrom, K.S. ∙ Xia, L. Mucin-type O-glycans and their roles in intestinal homeostasis Glycobiology. 2013; 23 :1026-1037 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tailford et al., 2015 54. Tailford, L.E. ∙ Crost, E.H. ∙ Kavanaugh, D. ... Mucin glycan foraging in the human gut microbiome Front. Genet. 2015; 6 :81 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that meropenem treatment during GVHD could be compromising the colonic mucus layer. To this end, we first evaluated the ability of our murine BT isolate (MDA-JAX BT001) to utilize mucin as a carbohydrate source, as well as a human-derived BT strain (ATCC 29148) and, as a comparison, non-mucolytic mouse-derived Enterococcus faecalis (MDA-JAX EF001). We found that supplementation of carbohydrate-poor media with porcine gastric mucin resulted in augmented growth of both BT strains, in contrast to no growth benefit for murine Enterococcus faecalis ( Figure S5 A), indicating that mucin-utilization enzymes were expressed by both BT strains. Using a periodic acid-Shiff (PAS)-based colorimetric assay, we also quantified degradation of mucin-derived carbohydrates and confirmed that both BT strains displayed degradation of mucin-derived carbohydrates ( Figure S5 B). We then asked if meropenem treatment impacted on the dense colonic mucus layer of allogeneic mice. In this regard, PAS staining of histological sections demonstrated a significantly thinned colonic mucus layer in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice compared with untreated allogeneic mice and syngeneic mice ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Decontamination, in contrast, led to preservation of this mucus layer in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice, suggesting that meropenem is leading to increased mucus degradation by colonic bacteria ( Figures 5 A and 5B). The mucus layer provides a critical contribution to the intestinal barrier by excluding bacteria from the intestinal lumen adjacent to the intestinal epithelium. We stained our histological sections with 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes and visualized dissemination of bacteria into the mucus layer and lamina propria of the colon in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice ( Figure 5 C). To better quantify the effects of meropenem on bacterial translocation, we cultivated MLNs microbiologically and found higher bacterial loads in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice. We found that translocating bacteria included BT ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Bacterial translocation has previously been found to aggravate GVHD via at least two mechanisms, including recruitment of neutrophils, which can compound tissue damage, as well as by enhancing antigen presentation by dendritic cells through activation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern signaling pathways ( Koyama et al., 2015 31. Koyama, M. ∙ Cheong, M. ∙ Markey, K.A. ... Donor colonic CD103+ dendritic cells determine the severity of acute graft-versus-host disease J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212 :1303-1321 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schwab et al., 2014 48. Schwab, L. ∙ Goroncy, L. ∙ Palaniyandi, S. ... Neutrophil granulocytes recruited upon translocation of intestinal bacteria enhance graft-versus-host disease via tissue damage Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :648-654 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus asked if this barrier compromise led to an inflammatory response in meropenem-treated mice and indeed observed marked colonic tissue infiltration by neutrophils and dendritic cells ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Altogether, these findings indicate that meropenem treatment compromises the colonic mucus layer and leads to increased bacterial translocation and an aggravated inflammatory response.
Notwithstanding that meropenem treatment led to higher abundances of BT in allogeneic mice, we also found that GVHD itself, without meropenem treatment, also resulted in moderate increases in abundances of BT, compared with syngeneic mice ( Figure 3 B). Allogeneic mice, however, did not display a notable thinning of the mucus layer or barrier compromise, despite increased intestinal abundances of BT. This led us to ask if meropenem treatment during GVHD may lead to alterations in the behavior of BT. To evaluate this further, we performed RNA sequencing of stool samples from allo-HSCT mice without and with meropenem treatment. We also examined the genome of our mouse-derived BT isolate (MDA-JAX BT001) ( Figure S5 C) and identified open reading frames (ORFs), which were then assigned to polysaccharide-utilization loci (PULs) using the polysaccharide-utilization loci database (PULDB) ( Terrapon et al., 2018 59. Terrapon, N. ∙ Lombard, V. ∙ Drula, É. ... PULDB: the expanded database of polysaccharide utilization loci Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D677-D683 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Data S1 ). We examined RNA reads that aligned to the BT genome and found that meropenem treatment led to upregulated expression in murine BT of GH2 β-galactosidase, GH33 sialidase, and GH29 α-L-fucosidase, all of which likely participate in the degradation of host mucin glycans ( Figure 6 A).
To characterize the contribution of its mucus-degrading capabilities when BT exacerbates GVHD, we evaluated the effects of a mucin-deficient BT strain in a murine GVHD model. This BT strain was engineered to be deficient in 11 PULs that contribute to mucin glycan degradation. This strain grew poorly in culture media containing porcine gastric mucin as the primary carbohydrate source and showed significantly decreased degradation of mucin-derived carbohydrates quantified by a PAS-based colorimetric assay, compared with wild-type (WT, ATCC 29148) BT ( Figures S5 D and S5E). We administered a 5-day antibiotic regimen composed of piperacillin/tazobactam in the drinking water and oral gavage of both vancomycin and metronidazole to eliminate endogenous Bacteroides from the intestinal microbiome in recipient mice. We then inoculated Bacteroides -free mice with either WT or mucin-deficient BT orally once daily for 3 days, followed 4 days later by allo-HSCT ( Figure S5 F). On day 21 after allo-HSCT, BT was abundant in fecal pellets from recipients that received WT BT or mucin-deficient BT but was absent in control mice ( Figure S5 G). Interestingly, allogeneic mice colonized by mucin-deficient BT showed significantly improved survival, compared with those colonized by WT BT ( Figure S5 H), suggesting that mucus-degrading capabilities of BT contribute to exacerbating GVHD.
Interestingly, in the presence of multiple suitable carbohydrate substrates, BT has been found to preferentially consume certain carbohydrates first, and only after depleting these will it then upregulate utilization genes targeting other available polysaccharides ( Rogers et al., 2013 43. Rogers, T.E. ∙ Pudlo, N.A. ∙ Koropatkin, N.M. ... Dynamic responses of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron during growth on glycan mixtures Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 88 :876-890 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Host mucin glycans are particularly low on the metabolic hierarchy and are typically targeted only after other dietary polysaccharides have been depleted ( TerAvest et al., 2014 58. TerAvest, M.A. ∙ He, Z. ∙ Rosenbaum, M.A. ... Regulated expression of polysaccharide utilization and capsular biosynthesis loci in biofilm and planktonic Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron during growth in chemostats Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014; 111 :165-173 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both ambient carbohydrates as well as metabolic byproducts have been found to be modulators of the BT trans criptional profile ( Schofield et al., 2018 46. Schofield, W.B. ∙ Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, M. ∙ Zimmermann, M. ... The stringent response determines the ability of a commensal bacterium to survive starvation and to persist in the gut Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 120.e6–132.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). We asked if levels of soluble carbohydrates in the colonic lumen are perturbed by meropenem treatment, given that we had found that meropenem depletes the abundance of commensal Clostridia, which function to metabolize dietary fibers and starches ( Chinda et al., 2004 13. Chinda, D. ∙ Nakaji, S. ∙ Fukuda, S. ... The fermentation of different dietary fibers is associated with fecal clostridia levels in men J. Nutr. 2004; 134 :1881-1886 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using ion chromatography-mass spectrometry (IC-MS), we characterized levels of luminal monosaccharides in the colon of mice. We found that meropenem treatment led to significantly lower concentrations of arabinose and xylose in allogeneic mice ( Figure 6 B). To examine the effects of the presence of monosaccharides on mucin utilization by BT, we cultivated BT in bacterial media containing porcine gastric mucin, then subsequently added a panel of monosaccharides, and finally quantified levels of remaining mucin using a colorimetric assay ( Figure S6 A). In the absence of additional monosaccharides, BT readily metabolized porcine gastric mucin. Mucin utilization by BT in the presence of certain monosaccharides, however, was significantly suppressed, including in particular mannose, glucose, or xylose ( Figure S6 B). We quantified by real-time PCR expression levels of GH2 β-galactosidase, GH33 sialidase, and GH29 α-L-fucosidase, and we found that expression of GH33 sialidase and GH29 α-L-fucosidase by murine BT were suppressed by these monosaccharides, but expression of GH2 β-galactosidase was not significantly impacted ( Figure S6 C). Altogether, these data indicate that following meropenem treatment, reductions in colonic monosaccharides, particularly xylose, may lead to increased mucus-degrading behavior by BT in the colon of allogeneic mice.
This understanding led us to hypothesize that oral supplementation with xylose could mediate a benefit in allogeneic mice with GVHD aggravated by meropenem. We treated allogeneic mice with meropenem, as in Figure 2 F, and with xylose from days 13 to 28 ( Figure 6 C). Interestingly, xylose supplementation prevented thinning of the colonic mucus thickness, compared with allogeneic mice receiving meropenem alone, while a different monosaccharide, glucose, did not alter colonic mucus thickness ( Figures 6 D, 6E, S6 D, and S6E), suggesting that xylose could prevent thinning of the colonic mucus more than glucose. We found that the relative abundances of BT were not significantly different in meropenem-treated mice with or without oral xylose supplementation ( Figure 6 F). In addition, in vitro , growth of mouse- and human-derived BT in carbohydrate-poor media was augmented by xylose ( Figure S6 F), suggesting that xylose supplementation does not prevent thinning of the colonic mucus thickness by suppressing the expansion of BT.
To profile the effects of xylose on intestinal BT in the setting of GVHD, we performed RNA sequencing of stool samples from meropenem-treated allogeneic mice without and with xylose supplementation. We determined the mean relative abundances of expression of individual genes, comparing meropenem-treated allogeneic mice with and without xylose, and evaluated for a potential correlation with the mean relative abundances observed comparing allogeneic mice with and without meropenem, from Figure 6 A. We found that a small amount of the changes in gene expression produced by meropenem could be attributed to changes in xylose (R = 0.08), but the slope of the linear regression was significant (p = 0.02, Figure 6 G). An examination of differentially abundant genes that could contribute to mucin glycan degradation revealed that one ORF, GH2_PUL89_16, was significantly downregulated by xylose supplementation in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice. Interestingly, meropenem-treated mice receiving glucose supplementation as a control monosaccharide did not show a similar effect ( Figures 6 H and S6 G). This ORF was not significantly upregulated by meropenem in allogeneic mice, however, and other enzymes that may contribute to mucin glycan degradation that were significantly upregulated by meropenem were not significantly downregulated by xylose. Overall, our examination of the impact of meropenem and xylose on BT gene expression indicates that xylose supplementation does not substantially restore the spectrum of effects on BT seen with meropenem treatment. Nevertheless, we asked if oral supplementation with xylose could impact on GVHD severity in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice. We found that xylose supplementation significantly improved the survival of these mice ( Figure 6 I). Together, these results suggest that xylose supplementation can inhibit the expression of enzymes by BT that may contribute to mucus degradation, leading to better preservation of the mucus barrier and improved survival. This strategy could represent a novel approach to ameliorate GVHD in the setting of an injured commensal microbiota following antibiotic treatment.

Section: Discussion

The use of prophylactic as well as empiric antibiotic treatment for neutropenic fever in patients undergoing allo-HSCT is supported by guidelines, and it effectively reduces infectious complications ( Freifeld et al., 2011 19. Freifeld, A.G. ∙ Bow, E.J. ∙ Sepkowitz, K.A. ..., Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America Clin.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis for adult patients with cancer-related immunosuppression: ASCO and IDSA clinical practice guideline update J. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 36 :3043-3054 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, studies of the effects of antibiotics on other clinical outcomes, including GVHD, have shown mixed results over time. More recent studies have demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially carbapenems, are associated with an increased incidence of acute intestinal GVHD ( Elgarten et al . , 2021 18. Elgarten, C.W. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Getz, K.D. ...

Increased GVHD-related mortality with broad-spectrum antibiotic use after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in human patients and mice Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :339ra71 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ), but mechanisms underlying these associations have not yet been fully identified. Here, we report establishing a mouse model of meropenem-aggravated GVHD with microbiome profiles that largely recapitulate those seen in allo-HSCT patients.
Our results in patients and mice indicate that meropenem treatment leads to a loss of intestinal Clostridia. Previous studies have shown that Clostridia play an important role in producing SCFAs, including butyrate that plays a role in regulating intestinal immunity ( Arpaia et al., 2013 2. Arpaia, N. ∙ Campbell, C. ∙ Fan, X. ... Metabolites produced by commensal bacteria promote peripheral regulatory T-cell generation Nature. 2013; 504 :451-455 Crossref Scopus (3315) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smith et al., 2013 51. Smith, P.M. ∙ Howitt, M.R. ∙ Panikov, N. ... The microbial metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, regulate colonic Treg cell homeostasis Science. 2013; 341 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (3858) PubMed Google Scholar ). A loss of Clostridia during GVHD results in increased epithelial injury ( Mathewson et al . , 2016 37. Mathewson, N.D. ∙ Jenq, R. ∙ Mathew, A.V. ... Gut microbiome-derived metabolites modulate intestinal epithelial cell damage and mitigate graft-versus-host disease Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :505-513 Crossref Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we confirm that a loss of Clostridia by meropenem treatment leads to decreased levels of SCFAs and compromised exclusion of Bacteroidia, including BT, from the mucosal surface. Interestingly, meropenem-treated mice that received decontamination therapy had improved survival, suggesting that meropenem aggravates intestinal GVHD not only via the suppression of beneficial bacteria but also through the expansion of harmful bacteria. Meropenem treatment led to increased bacteria with mucolytic functional activity, including BT, Akkermansia , and Bifidobacterium . Akkermansia muciniphila expansion and compromised intestinal barrier function, following imipenem-cilastatin treatment, were previously reported to be associated with exacerbated intestinal GVHD in mice ( Shono et al . , 2016 49. Shono, Y. ∙ Docampo, M.D. ∙ Peled, J.U. ... Increased GVHD-related mortality with broad-spectrum antibiotic use after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in human patients and mice Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :339ra71 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, increases in BT following meropenem treatment were most apparent, along with thinning of the colonic mucus layer and increased bacterial translocation. Supporting the hypothesis that BT could be a key contributor to exacerbated intestinal GVHD, we found that re-introduction of BT to decontaminated mice resulted in an aggravated GVHD phenotype. BT can play a role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by producing SCFAs, especially acetate and propionate ( van der Hee and Wells, 2021 60. van der Hee, B. ∙ Wells, J.M. Microbial regulation of host physiology by short-chain fatty acids Trends Microbiol. 2021; 29 :700-712 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wrzosek et al., 2013 62. Wrzosek, L. ∙ Miquel, S. ∙ Noordine, M.L. ... Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii influence the production of mucus glycans and the development of goblet cells in the colonic epithelium of a gnotobiotic model rodent BMC Biol. 2013; 11 :61 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ). In genetically predisposed mice, however, BT can induce colitis in a manner dependent on mucus-degrading function ( Bloom et al . , 2011 8. Bloom, S.M. ∙ Bijanki, V.N. ∙ Nava, G.M. ... Commensal Bacteroides species induce colitis in host-genotype-specific fashion in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 9 :390-403 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hickey et al . , 2015 21. Hickey, C.A. ∙ Kuhn, K.A. ∙ Donermeyer, D.L. ... Colitogenic Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron antigens access host immune cells in a sulfatase-dependent manner via outer membrane vesicles Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17 :672-680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Allo-HSCT can lead to a state that is comparably prone to inflammation due to the presence of alloreactive immune cells. Our results suggest that compromise of the colonic mucus layer by BT with increased mucolytic functional activity results in translocation of bacteria, which then results in worsened GVHD.
Allogeneic mice, even without meropenem treatment, had higher abundances of BT, compared with syngeneic mice, but did not show the same degree of compromise of the colonic mucus layer seen after receiving meropenem. Bacterial gene expression profiling demonstrated that meropenem treatment resulted in changes in the behavior of BT in mice, with upregulation of several enzymes predicted to be involved in the degradation of mucin glycans. A mutated strain of BT deficient in multiple mucin-utilizing enzymes did not aggravate GVHD-related mortality as much as a WT BT strain, indicating that increased degradation of mucin glycans in allogeneic mice contributes to GVHD severity. It has been reported that ambient levels of nutrients and metabolites play a major role in determining transcriptional profiles in BT ( Schofield et al., 2018 46. Schofield, W.B. ∙ Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, M. ∙ Zimmermann, M. ... The stringent response determines the ability of a commensal bacterium to survive starvation and to persist in the gut Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 120.e6–132.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Xylose was significantly decreased by meropenem treatment in allogeneic mice, and its presence acted to downregulate mucin-degrading enzymes and suppress mucin utilization by BT both in vitro and in vivo . Because BT can utilize xylose as a carbon source ( Dodd et al., 2011 15. Dodd, D. ∙ Mackie, R.I. ∙ Cann, I.K. Xylan degradation, a metabolic property shared by rumen and human colonic Bacteroidetes Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79 :292-304 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results are consistent with xylose functioning to suppress mucus-degrading behavior by BT, rather than acting as a global inhibitor.
In summary, we have found that the expansion of BT in meropenem-treated mice contributes to GVHD-related mortality. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are useful for treating infections in allo-HSCT. However, an altered intestinal environment due to a loss of bacterial subsets can perturb ambient levels of monosaccharides, which can in turn impact on the behavior of commensal mucolytic bacteria, resulting in increased severity of GVHD. This improved understanding of how antibiotic-mediated microbiome injury leads to increased severity of intestinal GVHD should help facilitate the development of strategies to better prevent and treat this important limitation of allo-HSCT.
The effects of xylose on intestinal bacteria are not fully characterized in this study. Our study has not examined other potential effects of xylose, including on mucin secretion by the host, or a possible impact on other intestinal bacterial subsets. We have also not investigated why xylose levels are reduced following meropenem treatment, but this could be due to the loss of many subsets of intestinal bacteria. Clostridia, in particular, may function to improve the production of xylose from dietary xylose-containing polysaccharides via enzymatic degradation. Finally, confirmation that a similar phenomenon occurs in the intestinal microbiome of allo-HSCT patients is also important for future studies.

295 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with fludarabine plus busulfan as conditioning therapy and tacrolimus and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis from 2011 and 2016 at MD Anderson Cancer Center and were analyzed retrospectively. We classified patients by antibiotic exposures, including those who received neither cefepime nor meropenem, those who received cefepime alone, those who received meropenem alone and those who received both cefepime and meropenem from days -10 to 30 after allo-HSCT. Acute GVHD was diagnosed by clinical and/or pathological findings, and graded according to standard criteria ( Przepiorka et al., 1995 41. Przepiorka, D., Weisdorf, D., Martin, P., Klingemann, H.G., Beatty, P., Hows, J. and Thomas, E.D. 1994 Consensus Conference on acute GVHD grading. Bone Marrow Transplant. 15, 825–828. Google Scholar ). For patient microbiome analyses, we identified 26 meropenem-unexposed patients and 18 meropenem-exposed patients who underwent allo-HSCT with fludarabine plus busulfan as conditioning therapy from 2014 to 2019 and provided stool samples for our biorepository on day 14 after allo-HSCT. Signed informed consent was provided by all study participants, and this study was approved by the University of Texas MD Anderson’s Institutional Review Board (PA17-0035).
Samples were collected from patients undergoing stem cell transplantation and stored at 4°C for 24-48 h until aliquoted for long-term storage at -80°C.
Female C57BL/6J (B6: H-2 b ) and B6D2F1 (H-2 b/d , CD45.2 + ) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All animal experiments were performed under the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Published by the US National Institutes of Health and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiments in this manuscript were performed in a non-blinded fashion.
For subcutaneous administration, meropenem was dissolved with PBS and given at a concentration of 10 mg/day. For oral administration, meropenem was dissolved with phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and given at a concentration of 0.625 g/L in the drinking water from days 3 to 15 after transplant. Levofloxacin and cefepime were supplemented to autoclaved drinking water at a concentration of 0.25 g/L ( Schroeder et al., 2001 47. Schroeder, T.H. ∙ Reiniger, N. ∙ Meluleni, G. ... Transgenic cystic fibrosis mice exhibit reduced early clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the respiratory tract J.

Piperacillin/tazobactam and nystatin were given at a concentration of 3.2 g/L and 320,000 IU/L respectively in combination with meropenem in the drinking water from days 5 to 15 after transplant. In a murine model where we introduced a mucin-deficient mutate strain of BT, piperacillin/tazobactam was given at a concentration of 3.2 g/L in combination with vancomycin and metronidazole dosed 1.5 mg daily by oral gavage from days -16 to -12 relative to transplant.
D-(+)-xylose (X3877, Sigma-Aldrich) or D-(+)-glucose (G8270, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in phosphate buffer pH 8.0 with meropenem or in water without meropenem and given at a concentration of 0.5% from days 13 to 28 after allo-HSCT.

In brief, after receiving myeloablative total body irradiation (11 Gray) delivered in 2 doses at 4 hour intervals, B6D2F1 (H-2 b/d ) mice were i.v. injected with 5 × 10 6 bone marrow (BM) cells and 5 × 10 6 splenocytes from allogeneic B6 (H-2 b ) or syngeneic B6D2F1 donors. Female mice that were 8 to 12-weeks-old were allocated randomly to each experimental group, ensuring the mean body weight in each group was similar. Total body radiotherapy was performed using a Shepherd Mark I, Model 30, 137 Cs irradiator. Mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free (SPF) condition and received normal chow (LabDiet PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 5053, Lab Supply) after HSCT. Survival after HSCT was monitored daily and the degree of clinical GVHD was assessed weekly by using an established scoring system ( Cooke et al., 1996 14. Cooke, K.R. ∙ Kobzik, L. ∙ Martin, T.R. ... An experimental model of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome after bone marrow transplantation: I. The roles of minor H antigens and endotoxin Blood. 1996; 88 :3230-3239 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
For pathological analysis, samples of the small intestine, colon and liver were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Pathology scores were quantified by a blinded pathologist. For evaluation of mucus thickness, colonic sections containing stool pellets were fixed in methanol-Carnoy’s fixative composed of methanol 60%, chloroform 30% and glacial acetic acid 10% and 5 μm sections were made and stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Sections were imaged using an Aperio AT2. Mucus thickness of the colonic sections were measured using eSlide Manager Version 12.4.3.5008. Eight measurements per image were taken and averaged over the entire usable colon surface. Immunohistochemistry was performed using primary antibodies of rabbit anti-CD11b (ab75476, Abcam), visualized using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained using hematoxylin.
Colon containing stool pellets were fixed in methanol-Carnoy’s fixative and the 5 μm thin sections were made as described above. Paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed and hydrated. Sections were incubated with 1 μg Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated EUB338 (5′-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3′) for detection of all bacteria in 200 μL of hybridization buffer (750 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 0.01% BSA, 10% dextran sulfate) at 40°C for 16 h ( Okumura et al., 2016 39. Okumura, R. ∙ Kurakawa, T. ∙ Nakano, T. ... Lypd8 promotes the segregation of flagellated microbiota and colonic epithelia Nature. 2016; 532 :117-121 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sections were rinsed in wash buffer (50 mM NaCl, 4 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.02 mM EDTA), washed at 45°C for 20 min, stained with anti-Muc2 antibody [C3] (GTX100664, GeneTex) and counterstained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Photographs of sections were obtained using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon NIS Elements, Advanced Research version 4.20).
Fecal samples which were collected from patients and mice and colonic mucosal samples which were collected from mice were weighed before DNA isolation. In brief, genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (51306, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol that was modified to include an intensive bead-beating lysis step. The V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from 100 ng of each of extracted and purified genomic DNA using 515 forward and 806 reverse primer pairs ( Caporaso et al., 2012 11. Caporaso, J.G. ∙ Lauber, C.L. ∙ Walters, W.A. ... Ultra-high-throughput microbial community analysis on the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms ISME J. 2012; 6 :1621-1624 Crossref Scopus (6379) PubMed Google Scholar ). The quality and quantity of the barcoded amplicons were assessed on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent) and Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and libraries were prepared after pooling at equimolar ratios. The final libraries were purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (28706X4, Qiagen) and sequenced with a 2 × 250 base pair paired-end protocol on the Illumina MiSeq platform.
Sequencing data from paired-end reads were de-multiplexed using QIIME 2 ( Bolyen et al., 2019 9. Bolyen, E. ∙ Rideout, J.R. ∙ Dillon, M.R. ... Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2 Nat Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :852-857 Crossref Scopus (11083) PubMed Google Scholar ). Merging of paired-end reads, dereplicating, and length filtering was performed using VSEARCH 2.17.1 ( Rognes et al., 2016 44. Rognes, T. ∙ Flouri, T. ∙ Nichols, B. ... VSEARCH: a versatile open source tool for metagenomics PeerJ. 2016; 4 :e2584 Crossref Scopus (6127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following de-noising and chimera calling using the unoise3 command ( Edgar, 2016 17. Edgar, R.C. UNOISE2: improved error-correction for Illumina 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing bioRxiv. 2016; 081257 Crossref Google Scholar ), unique sequences were taxonomically classified with mothur ( Schloss et al., 2009 45. Schloss, P.D. ∙ Westcott, S.L. ∙ Ryabin, T. ... Introducing mothur: open-source, platform-independent, community-supported software for describing and comparing microbial communities Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75 :7537-7541 Crossref Scopus (16398) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Silva database ( Quast et al., 2013 42. Quast, C. ∙ Pruesse, E. ∙ Yilmaz, P. ... The SILVA ribosomal RNA gene database project: improved data processing and web-based tools Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D590-D596 Crossref Scopus (19350) PubMed Google Scholar ) version 138. Weighted UniFrac distances ( Lozupone et al., 2011 35. Lozupone, C. ∙ Lladser, M.E. ∙ Knights, D. ... UniFrac: an effective distance metric for microbial community comparison ISME J. 2011; 5 :169-172 Crossref Scopus (1955) PubMed Google Scholar ) were determined using QIIME 2, visualized using principal coordinate analysis, and evaluated for statistical significance using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) testing. For differential abundance analysis, abundances of sequences belonging to taxonomical groups were included for analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the method of Benjamini-Hochberg. Paired samples were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test with adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Genomic DNA was isolated from stool as described above. qPCR was performed as previously described ( Yang et al., 2015 63. Yang, Y.W. ∙ Chen, M.K. ∙ Yang, B.Y. ... Use of 16S rRNA gene-targeted group-specific primers for real-time PCR analysis of predominant bacteria in mouse feces Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2015; 81 :6749-6756 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from total fecal DNA using the primers 926F (5′-AAACTCAAAKGAATTGACGG-3′) and 1062R (5′-CTCACRRCACGAGCTGAC-3′). Real-time PCR were carried out in 96-well optical plates on QuantStudio Flex 6 RT PCR (Thermo Fisher) and KAPA SYBR FAST Master Mix (Roche). The PCR conditions included one initial denaturing step of 10 min at 95°C and 40 cycles of 95°C for 20 sec and 60°C for 1 min. Melting-curve analysis was performed after amplification. To determined bacterial density, a plasmid with a 16S rRNA gene of a murine Blautia isolate was generated in the pCR4 backbone and used as a standard.
Murine colons were isolated, dissected longitudinally and then on a shaker in 2% fetal bovine serum in PBS with 1 mM DL-dithiothreitol (Bioworld) at 37°C for 20 min and subsequently incubated with 1.3 mM EDTA at 37°C for 40 min. They were rinsed twice and digested with 0.3 mg/ml of type IV collagenase (C5138, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 45 min, homogenized, filtered, and washed.
Monoclonal antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocynate, phycoerythrin, phycoerythrin-Cy7, peridinin-chlorophyll protein complexes, allophycocyanin, or allophycocyanin-Cy7 were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA,). Lamina propria cells in colon were stained with the antibodies against murine CD45 (30-F11, BioLegend), CD11b (M1/70, BioLegend), CD11c (N418, BioLegend), CD103 (2E7, BioLegend), Ly6G (1A8, BioLegend), MHC-II (M5/114.15.2, BioLegend) and F4/80 (BM8, BioLegend) and Zombie Aqua Fixable viability kit (423101, BioLegend). In flow cytometric analysis, at least 100,000 live samples were analyzed using BD LSRFortessa™ X-20 (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, OR). The CD45 + cells were classified into neutrophils (CD11b + Ly6G + ) and dendritic cells (CD11c + MHC-II + CD103 + ).
Mouse-derived BT (MDA-JAX BT001), Enterococcus faecalis (MDA-JAX EF001) and Clostridium disporicum (MDA-JAX CD001), Clostridium saudiense (MDA-JAX CS001), and Lachnospiraceae unclassified (MDA-JAX LS001) were isolated and cultured from mouse stool samples suspended in 1 mL of chilled 20% anaerobic glycerol in a Whitley anaerobic chamber (10% H 2 , 5% CO 2 and 85% N 2 ). Human-derived BT (ATCC 29148) was purchased from ATCC. Bacterial number was quantified using a Nexcelom Cellometer cell counter with SYTO™ BC dye and propidium iodide. For measuring MICs against meropenem, bacteria were cultured on BYE plates including 5% sterilized rumen fluid (Fisher Scientific) with MIC test strips (Liofilchem™ MTS™ Meropenem [MRP] 0.016-256 μg/mL, Fisher Scientific). Bacterial growth experiments were performed in a novel bacterial liquid media, BYEM10, composed of a hybrid of BHI and M10 supplemented with yeast extract ( Table S4 ). Bacteria were cultured up to 48 h at a starting concentration of 1 × 10 6 bacteria/ml in BYEM10 broth (pH 7.2) with and without 5 mg/mL of porcine gastric mucin (M1778, Sigma-Aldrich) with or without 0.5 mg/mL of D-(+)-xylose (X3877), D-(+)-mannose (M8574, Sigma-Aldrich) or D-(+)-glucose (G8270). Optical densities (OD 600 nm ) of bacterial cultures were measured with a BioTek EPOCH 2 plate reader.
We constructed a BT mutant with reduced ability to utilize mucin as a nutrient source by deleting 11 different polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that were previously associated with mucin utilization either through direct growth on mucin O -glycans in vitro ( Martens et al., 2008 36. Martens, E.C. ∙ Chiang, H.C. ∙ Gordon, J.I. Mucosal glycan foraging enhances fitness and transmission of a saccharolytic human gut bacterial symbiont Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4 :447-457 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (664) PubMed Google Scholar ) or expression during growth in vivo in the ceca of mice fed a low fiber diet ( Bjursell et al., 2006 7. Bjursell, M.K. ∙ Martens, E.C. ∙ Gordon, J.I. Functional genomic and metabolic studies of the adaptations of a prominent adult human gut symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, to the suckling period J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :36269-36279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sonnenburg et al., 2005 52. Sonnenburg, J.L. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Leip, D.D. ... Glycan foraging in vivo by an intestine-adapted bacterial symbiont Science. 2005; 307 :1955-1959 Crossref Scopus (936) PubMed Google Scholar ). The latter in vivo condition promotes expression of mucin utilization functions. A total of 93 genes encoding 37 annotated enzymes (17 sulfatases, 19 glycoside hydrolases and 1 M60-like protease) were eliminated. PUL deletions were made by allelic exchange using the counter-selectable vector, pExchange- tdk , in a thymidine kinase ( tdk ) deletion strain to allow counter selection using 5-fluoro-2-deoxy-uridine (FUdR) as previously described ( Koropatkin et al., 2008 30. Koropatkin, N.M. ∙ Martens, E.C. ∙ Gordon, J.I. ... Starch catabolism by a prominent human gut symbiont is directed by the recognition of amylose helices Structure. 2008; 16 :1105-1115 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 750 bp flanks were amplified adjacent to each PUL using primers listed in Table S5 and the separate products joined into a single ∼1.5 kbp fragment via overlapping ends. Each fragment was cloned into pExchange- tdk , validated by sequencing and conjugated into either the BT Δ tdk parent strain or a previously constructed PUL mutant in order to create the compounded mutant lines after appropriate positive selection using erythromycin and counter-selection using FUdR ( Koropatkin et al., 2008 30. Koropatkin, N.M. ∙ Martens, E.C. ∙ Gordon, J.I. ... Starch catabolism by a prominent human gut symbiont is directed by the recognition of amylose helices Structure. 2008; 16 :1105-1115 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). The order of gene deletions was as follows, with the numbers being inclusive (i.e., in the first mutant, genes BT3172 and BT3180 were part of the deletion): BT3172-80, BT1617-36 (two tandem PULs removed together), BT3796-3800, BT3092-3109, BT0752-57, BT2912-23, BT4681-84, BT4634-31, BT0865-67, BT4250-40 .
Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were harvested from mice and homogenized in PBS and cultured anaerobically on BHI plates containing yeast extract and 5% sterilized rumen fluid (Fisher Scientific) and Columbia blood agar plates (BD) for 4 days at 37°C. Colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted and adjusted per organ. Bacteria were identified by MALDI Biotyper.
Levels of mucin glycans in culture supernatants were determined by a PAS-based colorimetric assay as previously described ( Kilcoyne et al., 2011 28. Kilcoyne, M. ∙ Gerlach, J.Q. ∙ Farrell, M.P. ... Periodic acid-Schiff’s reagent assay for carbohydrates in a microtiter plate format Anal. Biochem. 2011; 416 :18-26 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Briefly, culture supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 g, 4°C for 10 min and collected. To perform mucin precipitation, 500 μL of culture supernatants were mixed with 1 mL of molecular grade ethanol and incubated at -30°C for overnight. Culture supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 g, 4°C for 10 min. Mucin-containing pellets were washed with 1 mL of molecular grade ethanol twice and resuspended in 500 μL of PBS. 10 μL of washed culture supernatants were transferred into round bottom 96-well plate (Falcon) containing 15 μL of PBS. Serially diluted porcine gastric mucin (Sigma) standards were prepared. Freshly prepared 0.06% periodic acid in 7% acetic acid was added, and incubated at 37°C for 90 min, followed by 100 μL of Schiff’s reagent (84655, Sigma) and incubation at room temperature for 40 min. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a BioTek Synergy HTX plate reader.
To determine the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids in mouse feces samples, extracts were prepared and analyzed by ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Fecal pellets were homogenized with a Precellys Tissue Homogenizer. Metabolites were extracted using 1 mL ice-cold 0.1% Ammonium hydroxide in 80/20 (v/v) methanol/water. Extracts were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 5 min at 4°C, and supernatants were transferred to clean tubes, followed by evaporation to dryness under nitrogen. Dried extracts were reconstituted in deionized water, and 5 μL was injected for analysis by IC-MS. IC mobile phase A (MPA; weak) was water, and mobile phase B (MPB; strong) was water containing 100 mM KOH. A Thermo Scientific Dionex ICS-5000+ system included a Thermo IonPac AS11 column (4 μm particle size, 250 × 2 mm) with column compartment kept at 30°C. The autosampler tray was chilled to 4°C. The mobile phase flow rate was 360 μL/min, and the gradient elution program was: 0-5 min, 1% MPB; 5-25 min, 1-35% MPB; 25-39 min, 35-99% MPB; 39-49 min, 99% MPB; 49-50, 99-1% MPB. The total run time was 50 min. To assist the desolvation for better sensitivity, methanol was delivered by an external pump and combined with the eluent via a low dead volume mixing tee. Data were acquired using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer under ESI negative ionization mode at a resolution of 240,000. Raw data files were imported to Thermo Trace Finder and Compound Discoverer software for spectrum database analysis. The relative abundance of each metabolite was normalized by sample weight.
C57BL/6 mice were treated with 10 mg of meropenem by subcutaneously injection. Cecal contents were collected prior to, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 h after meropenem injection. To determine the relative abundance of meropenem in mouse cecum samples, extracts were prepared and analyzed with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantiva triple quadruple mass spectrometer coupled with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system. Approximately 600 mgs of mouse cecal contents were homogenized with a Precellys Tissue Homogenizer. Metabolites were extracted using 100% acetonitrile. The tissue lysates were vortexed, centrifuged at 17,000 g for 5 min at 4°C, and organic layers were transferred to clean tubes, followed by evaporation to dryness under nitrogen. Dried extracts were reconstituted in 50/50 (v/v) water/Acetonitrile, and 5 μL was injected for analysis by LC-MS. The mobile phase A is 100% water and mobile phase B is 0.1% Formic Acid in acetonitrile. Separation of meropenem was achieved on an Agilent SB-C18, 1.8 μm, 100 × 3 mm column. The flow rate was 250 μL/min at 35 °C, and the gradient elution program was: 0-1 min, 5% MPB; 1-5 min, 5-50% MPB; 5-6 min, 50-95% MPB; 6-10 min, 95% MPB; 10-10.1 min, 95-5% MPB. The total run time was 15 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the MRM positive ion electrospray mode with the transition m/z 384.1 -> 68.0. Raw data files were imported to Thermo Trace Finder software for final analysis. The relative abundance of meropenem was normalized by sample weight.

BT (MDA-JAX BT001) genomic DNA was isolated and purified using a Qiagen Genomic-tip 20/G column, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For short-read Illumina sequencing, libraries were constructed with a Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All libraries were quantified with a TapeStation and pooled in equal molar ratios. The final libraries were sequenced with the NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) to produce 2×150 bp paired-end reads, resulting in ∼5 Gb per sample. For long-read Nanopore sequencing, 500 ng of genomic DNA was used for library preparation using the Rapid Sequencing Kit (SQK-RAD004, Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Libraries were loaded into a FLO-MIN106 flow-cell for 24h sequencing run on a MinION sequencer platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Data acquisition and real-time base calling were carried out by the MinKNOW software version 3.6.5. The fastq files were generated from basecalled sequencing fast5 reads.

Approximately 30 mg of stool was freshly collected in 700 μL of ice cold Qiazol containing 200 μL of 0.1 mm diameter Zirconia Silica beads (11079101z, BioSpec). Samples were bead beaten twice for 2 min with a 30 second interval recovery. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 min and the supernatant was collected for RNA isolation using the RNeasy mini kit (74104, Qiagen). RNA was treated on column with DNase I (79254, Qiagen) to eliminate contaminating genomic DNA. RNA quantity and quality was determined using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent). 250 ng of total RNA from mouse stools was used to construct libraries using the Nugen Ovation Complete Prokaryotic RNA-Seq Systems (NuGen) or the Universal Prokaryotic RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (9367-32, Tecan) with Unique Dual Indexes (S02480-FG, Tecan), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq or NovaSeq 6000 system to produce either 1×300 bp single-end reads or 2×150 bp paired-end reads. Sequence data were demultiplexed using QIIME 2 ( Bolyen et al., 2019 9. Bolyen, E. ∙ Rideout, J.R. ∙ Dillon, M.R. ... Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2 Nat Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :852-857 Crossref Scopus (11083) PubMed Google Scholar ) and their qualities were checked using VSEARCH 2.17.1 ( Rognes et al., 2016 44. Rognes, T. ∙ Flouri, T. ∙ Nichols, B. ... VSEARCH: a versatile open source tool for metagenomics PeerJ. 2016; 4 :e2584 Crossref Scopus (6127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data were filtered and truncated by quality with VSEARCH default settings. The total reads of mouse stool samples were 950923 ± 113406 (mean ± standard deviation) in Figure 6 A and 137623366 ± 38865363 in Figures 6 G, 6H, and S6 G. Sequences of ribosomal RNA were removed using BWA software against prokaryotic ribosomal RNA sequences from prokaryotic RefSeq genomes ( Tatusova et al., 2016 56. Tatusova, T. ∙ DiCuccio, M. ∙ Badretdin, A. ... NCBI prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :6614-6624 Crossref Scopus (4601) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequences of interest were further identified using DIAMOND software version 0.9.24 ( Buchfink et al., 2015 10. Buchfink, B. ∙ Xie, C. ∙ Huson, D.H. Fast and sensitive protein alignment using DIAMOND Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :59-60 Crossref Scopus (7196) PubMed Google Scholar ) to align against PULs. Features with percent identity less than 80% were excluded. The total counts of bacterial isolated samples were 104172 ± 101292 (mean ± standard deviation) in Figure 6 A and 5761717 ± 2518881 in Figures 6 G, 6H, and S6 G. Aligned mRNA expression changes were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test in R software version 3.6.0 via RStudio version 1.2.1335. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Total RNA was isolated from in vitro cultured BT as described above. The cDNA was synthesized using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (4368814, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mRNA levels of selected targets were quantified by qPCR using KAPA SYBR FAST Master Mix (Roche) and specific probes (GH2, 5′-CGCACTCTTCTTGCATCTGC-3′ for the forward primer, 5′-TACCAACGGCTCACATTGGG-3′ for the reverse primer; GH29, 5′-GATGCTGGAAAAGGCAACGG-3′ for the forward primer, 5′-AGCGTGCCTTTTCCTTCTGA-3′ for the reverse primer; GH33, 5′-GGTCACCGAAAGACATTATTCATCG-3′ for the forward primer, 5′-GCCGTTTGATACAGATCCATTCC-3′ for the reverse primer) and were normalized to BT specific probes (5′-CACAACAGCCATAGCGTTCCA-3′ for the forward primer, 5′-ATCGCAAAAATAAGATGGGCAAA-3′ for the reverse primer) ( Benjdia et al., 2011 5.

Data were checked for normality and similar variances between groups and Student’s t-tests were used when appropriate. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare data between two groups when the data did not follow a normal distribution. The Kaplan-Meier curves were used to depict survival probabilities and the log-rank test was applied to compare survival curves. For clinical data analysis, non-repeated ANOVA was used to compare continuous variables, while chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests were used to analyze the frequency distribution between categorical variables. Analyses were performed using R software version 3.6.0 and Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
