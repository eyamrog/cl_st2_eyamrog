Title: Stem-like intestinal Th17 cells give rise to pathogenic effector T cells during autoimmunity


Abstract: Summary

While intestinal Th17 cells are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis, recent studies have implicated their roles in the development of extra-intestinal autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanisms by which tissue Th17 cells mediate these dichotomous functions remain unknown. Here, we characterized the heterogeneity, plasticity, and migratory phenotypes of tissue Th17 cells in vivo by combined fate mapping with profiling of the transcriptomes and TCR clonotypes of over 84,000 Th17 cells at homeostasis and during CNS autoimmune inflammation. Inter- and intra-organ single-cell analyses revealed a homeostatic, stem-like TCF1 + IL-17 + SLAMF6 + population that traffics to the intestine where it is maintained by the microbiota, providing a ready reservoir for the IL-23-driven generation of encephalitogenic GM-CSF + IFN-γ + CXCR6 + T cells. Our study defines a direct in vivo relationship between IL-17 + non-pathogenic and GM-CSF + and IFN-γ + pathogenic Th17 populations and provides a mechanism by which homeostatic intestinal Th17 cells direct extra-intestinal autoimmune disease.

Section: Introduction

Interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing CD4 + T cells (Th17 cells) play an important role in multiple autoimmune diseases ( Weaver et al., 2013 88. Weaver, C.T. ∙ Elson, C.O. ∙ Fouser, L.A. ...

This has been supported experimentally in pre-clinical models of human autoimmune diseases, in which in vitro -differentiated Th17 cells with specificity for self-antigens induce tissue inflammation and autoimmunity ( Ghoreschi et al., 2010 20.

However, recent studies propose that IL-17 and Th17 cells are not critical for driving autoimmune tissue inflammation ( Haak et al., 2009 21. Haak, S. ∙ Croxford, A.L. ∙ Kreymborg, K. ...

It has been difficult to reconcile some of these opposing data, and it is unclear whether these two effector T cell populations are related to one another or are independent subsets with distinct origins.
A related, open question concerns the homeostatic versus pathogenic functions of Th17 cells. Th17 cells, besides being highly pathogenic and inducing autoimmunity, have also been implicated in mediating tissue homeostatic functions and in regulating tissue integrity. Th17 cells mediate host defense against extracellular bacterial and fungal infections ( Hernández-Santos and Gaffen, 2012 25. Hernández-Santos, N. ∙ Gaffen, S.L. Th17 cells in immunity to Candida albicans Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 11 :425-435 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bedoya et al., 2013 2. Bedoya, S.K. ∙ Lam, B. ∙ Lau, K. ... Th17 cells in immunity and autoimmunity Clin. Dev. Immunol. 2013; 2013 :986789 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the intestine, where most Th17 cells are present during homeostasis, Th17 cells contribute to intestinal barrier integrity and limit microbial invasion ( Blaschitz and Raffatellu, 2010 6.

Plasticity of Th17 cells in Peyer’s patches is responsible for the induction of T cell-dependent IgA responses Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, intestinal Th17 cells have been suggested to influence extra-intestinal autoimmune diseases, such that their microbiota-specific induction led to exacerbated autoimmune disease in extra-intestinal sites in multiple disease models ( Lee et al., 2011 47. Lee, Y.K. ∙ Menezes, J.S. ∙ Umesaki, Y. ... Proinflammatory T-cell responses to gut microbiota promote experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which tissue Th17 cells mediate such divergent functions, i.e., promoting intestinal homeostasis while contributing to the development of autoimmune tissue inflammation, remain unclear.
Recent studies suggest that Th17 cell function is affected by environmental changes such as circadian rhythm, specific metabolites, and the microbiota ( Yu et al., 2013 94.

However, whether Th17 cells attain different phenotypes and functions in distinct tissue microenvironments as do, for example, FoxP3 + T regs ( Panduro et al., 2016 60. Panduro, M. ∙ Benoist, C. ∙ Mathis, D. Tissue Tregs Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34 :609-633 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tissue-resident macrophages ( Lavin et al., 2014 46.

Tissue-resident macrophage enhancer landscapes are shaped by the local microenvironment Cell. 2014; 159 :1312-1326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1536) PubMed Google Scholar ), remains unknown. Furthermore, Th17 cells comprise a highly heterogeneous and plastic cell population in vivo , giving rise to multiple different effector and regulatory T cell populations ( Gaublomme et al., 2015 18.

However, it remains unclear how tissue Th17 cells integrate such diverse signals into a set of cellular programs that allow them to maintain tissue homeostasis yet become primary drivers of tissue inflammation.
Here, we combined single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing (scRNA-seq and TCR-seq) with fate-mapping studies to profile 84,124 tissue Th17 cells and characterize their heterogeneity, plasticity, and migration at homeostasis and during central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity. Tissue Th17 cells exhibited both tissue-specific signatures and intra-tissue heterogeneity. Upon induction of encephalomyelitis (EAE), we discovered a stem-like, intestinal TCF1 + SLAMF6 + IL-17 + population, that gives rise to a second pathogenic GM-CSF + interferon (IFN)-γ + CXCR6 + Th17 cell population that migrates specifically to the CNS. Our work identifies the transition of stem-like intestinal Th17 cells to pathogenic Th17 cells and explains the controversy over IL-17 + versus GM-CSF + IFN-γ + pathogenic T cells during EAE, a concept that is likely applicable to other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Section: Results

To characterize the diversity of Th17 cells within and across tissues during homeostasis, we profiled both current Th17 cells and ex-Th17 cells, obtained from multiple tissues of naive reporter mice, including spleen (SPL), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), Peyer’s patches (PP), small intestine (SI), and colon (COL), by droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq or scRNA/TCR-seq ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ). To identify instances of Th17 plasticity, we included all CD4 + T cells that ever-produced IL-17A, by crossing the active IL-17A-GFP reporter mouse ( Il17a GFP ) to the IL-17A fate-reporter mouse ( Il17a Cre Rosa26 tdTomato ) ( Hirota et al., 2011 26. Hirota, K. ∙ Duarte, J.H. ∙ Veldhoen, M. ... Fate mapping of IL-17-producing T cells in inflammatory responses Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :255-263 Crossref Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ) generating Il17aCre GFP X Rosa26 tdTomato mice and performing single-cell profiling of all CD4 + T cells that express tdTomato ( Figure 1 A; Figures S1 A and S1B). In this setting, tdTomato + GFP + cells are current Th17 cells, whereas tdTomato + GFP – cells are ex-Th17 cells. To account for biological and technical variation, we profiled cells in nine batches, each spanning multiple tissues, such that each tissue was represented in at least four of the batches ( Table S1 ). We distinguished ex-Th17 cells (GFP – ) from current Th17 cells (GFP + ) by the expression of the Il17a GFP transcript in each cell ( Figure S1 C). Intestinal tissues (SI and COL) had a higher frequency of tdTomato + cells and a higher ratio of current:ex-Th17 cells than the spleen and lymphoid tissues, indicating an increased presence of current Th17 cells in the intestinal sites, especially the colon ( Figures 1 B and 1C).
Clustering analysis divided 6,367 current Th17 cells (GFP + tdTomato + ) into nine subsets ( Figure 1 D; Figure S1 D) with distinct expression signatures ( Figure S1 E). Most clusters were dominated by cells from a single tissue type (50%–89%; Figure S1 F). The remaining clusters included Il17a GFP -expressing Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (T regs , cluster 6) and Mki67 + -proliferating Th17 cells (cluster 7), containing cells from all tissues ( Figures 1 D and 1E; Figures S1 D–S1F). Notably, these distinctions were not driven by experimental batch effects ( Figure S1 G). We concluded that tissue of origin is a major determinant of variance of the transcriptional states of Th17 cells.
We identified transcriptional signatures that distinguished all tissue Th17 cells (pan-tissue residency signature), Th17 cells from some tissues (multi-tissue signatures), and Th17 cells from single tissues (tissue-specific signatures) by comparing the expression profiles of Th17 cells from each tissue to those of splenic Th17 cells ( Figure 1 F; Table S2 ). Overall, 943 genes were significantly up- or downregulated versus spleen (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05; fold change ≥1.5) in at least one tissue population, 120 forming a pan-tissue residency signature, and 212 in one of the tissue-specific signatures. Colonic Th17 cells had the largest tissue-specific signature (62 upregulated and 31 downregulated genes, Figure 1 F) and were the most distant from splenic Th17 cell profiles on a principal components space ( Figure S1 H).
The pan-tissue signature included upregulated genes encoding Th17 effector molecules, such as Il17a , Il17f , Ifng , Cd69 , and Gzmb and downregulated genes known to antagonize the generation of effector T cells, such as Klf2 and Il7r ( Sebzda et al., 2008 73. Sebzda, E. ∙ Zou, Z. ∙ Lee, J.S. ... Transcription factor KLF2 regulates the migration of naive T cells by restricting chemokine receptor expression patterns Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :292-300 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tan et al., 2001 80. Tan, J.T. ∙ Dudl, E. ∙ LeRoy, E. ... IL-7 is critical for homeostatic proliferation and survival of naive T cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :8732-8737 Crossref Scopus (807) PubMed Google Scholar ) and was enriched in pathways involved in the responses to cytokines ( Figures 1 F and 1G). Tissue-specific Th17 signatures were enriched in processes highlighting functional differences of Th17 cells in different tissues ( Figure 1 G), for example, enrichment for response to bacteria in the colon-specific signature genes.
Notably, genes associated with a stem-like T cell state ( Ccr7 , Il7r , Sell , Tcf7 ) were highly expressed in the spleen and lymphoid tissues, while genes associated with activation of Th17 cells ( Cd44 , Cd69 , Il17a , Il17f , Il22 , Ifng ) were highly expressed in intestinal tissues ( Figure 1 H). Thus, intestinal Th17 cells had a more activated state than SPL, MLN, and PP populations. We observed similar expression signatures when considering the entire set of 37,773 tdTomato + profiled cells (ex-Th17 and current Th17 cells, Figures S2 A–S2E). Differential gene-expression analysis of ex- versus current Th17 cells showed relatively modest differences, with the top upregulated genes in current Th17 cells including, as expected, Il17a-GFP , Il17a , and Il17f , and genes involved in T cell activation (e.g., Lag3 , Pdcd1 , Ctla4 , Furin , Nr4a1 , Figure S2 F).
We next examined the variation between all Th17 cells (ex- and current Th17) within each tissue by clustering all cells (GFP + and GFP – ) from each tissue separately ( Figure 2 A) and quantifying the transcriptional similarity between each pair of clusters within and across tissues ( Figure 2 B).
Interestingly, sets of clusters from different tissues were transcriptionally similar, indicating the presence of Th17 cells of similar functional subpopulations in different tissue sites. We annotated each set of clusters by the genes that were differentially upregulated within each cluster-group relative to the other clusters in the tissue ( Figure 2 C). The shared clusters included an effector-like set (SI and COL; Il17a , Il17f , Ifng , and Furin ), comprising of most current Th17 cells in these tissues ( Figure 2 A); Tfh-like clusters (MLN, PP, and COL; Cxcr5 , Pdcd1 , Sh2d1a , Tbc1d4 , Izumo1r ), as previously described for Th17 cells in the PP ( Hirota et al., 2013 27. Hirota, K. ∙ Turner, J.E. ∙ Villa, M. ... Plasticity of Th17 cells in Peyer’s patches is responsible for the induction of T cell-dependent IgA responses Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ); stem-like clusters (SPL and MLN; Slamf6 , Tcf7 , Il6ra , Ccr6 , and Klf3 ), as well as a proliferating set (all tissues except MLN; Ccnb2 , Cks1b , Cks2 , Birc5 , Mki67 ) and a T reg set (all tissues except spleen; Foxp3 , Gzmb , Il10 , Il2ra , Lgmn ).
In particular, we identified small clusters of Th17 cells in the SPL, MLN, and PP that expressed high levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG-high; Ifit1 , Ifit3 , Irf7 , Isg15 , Isg20 ), similar to previously described ISG-high subpopulations ( Arazi et al., 2019 1.

We validated this prediction, confirming the presence of PD-L1 + tdTomato + cells in the SPL and MLN ( Figure S3 B), that expressed elevated levels of ISGs ( Figure S3 C). PD-L1 was also more frequently detected in the ISG-high T cells in other published datasets ( Arazi et al., 2019 1. Arazi, A. ∙ Rao, D.A. ∙ Berthier, C.C. ..., Accelerating Medicines Partnership in SLE network The immune cell landscape in kidneys of patients with lupus nephritis Nat.

Based on our scTCR-seq data, cells in the ISG-high clusters tended to have higher TCR repertoire similarity with clusters in their own tissue than those in other tissues ( Figure S3 E), indicating that the ISG-high cell population could be clonally related to cells in the same tissue.
Multiple previous studies described the presence of IL-17 + and/or RORγt + FoxP3 + T reg cells at homeostasis and during inflammatory diseases ( Yang et al., 2008 92.

Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the relationship of this Th17-like T reg population to cells in the T reg lineage or the Th17 lineage has not been determined.
To explore this, we first crossed the Il17a Cre X Rosa26 tdTomato mice to Foxp3 GFP reporter mice (generating Foxp3 GFP X Il17aCre tdTomato mice) and validated distinct populations of tdTomato + Foxp3 GFP+ cells by flow cytometry in each tissue ( Figure 2 D; Figures S3 F and S3G). We then assessed the cell lineage (clonal) and cell-fate relationships between tdTomato + Foxp3 + T reg cells and other Th17 cell subpopulations in tissues by the extent of TCR sharing. We identified a total of 3,706 different clonotypes across four mice, with only 12 clonotypes shared by two mice, and none by three or more mice ( Table S3 A,B).
Several lines of evidence suggested that T regs and non-T reg tissue Th17 cells have separate clonal origins. First, within a given tissue (e.g., COL), the TCR sequences in the tdTomato + T reg clusters were highly distinct from those of non-T reg Th17 clusters, while the non-T reg Th17 clusters displayed high TCR similarity with each other ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Figure S3 H). Furthermore, non-T reg tissue Th17 cells shared many TCR clonotypes with Th17 cells in the SPL (e.g., 40%–63% shared SPL and COL non-T reg ), while the corresponding tdTomato + T reg cells displayed significantly less TCR similarity (9%–21%) with cells in the SPL ( Figure 2 G; Figure S3 I). Thus, our paired scRNA/TCR-seq profiles indicate that at homeostasis, tdTomato + T reg cells are likely more frequently derived from a non-Th17 cell source, presumably tdTomato – T reg cells ( Figure S3 J), whereas different non-T reg tissue Th17 cells have high clonal similarities within a tissue and show intra-tissue plasticity and transitions between subpopulations.
Since Th17 cells are drivers of multiple autoimmune diseases ( Weaver et al., 2013 88. Weaver, C.T. ∙ Elson, C.O. ∙ Fouser, L.A. ... The Th17 pathway and inflammatory diseases of the intestines, lungs, and skin Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2013; 8 :477-512 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ; Korn et al., 2009 40. Korn, T. ∙ Bettelli, E. ∙ Oukka, M. ... IL-17 and Th17 Cells Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27 :485-517 Crossref Scopus (4066) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next analyzed tissue Th17 cell heterogeneity in an autoimmune setting in EAE, a mouse model for MS induced by immunization with the encephalitogenic MOG 35–55 peptide. Using scRNA/TCR-seq, we profiled 46,351 tdTomato + tissue Th17 cells (current and ex-Th17) isolated at onset of disease from the SPL, MLN, PP, COL, SI, the inguinal draining lymph nodes (DLN) of the EAE immunization site, and the CNS ( Figure 3 A; Table S1 ).
First, we focused on CNS-infiltrating T cells. The 8,942 Th17 (tdTomato + ) CNS-derived cells partitioned into five clusters ( Figures 3 B and 3C), which we annotated by differential gene signatures as quiescent (cluster 0), migratory (cluster 1), proliferating (cluster 2), CD8-like (cluster 3), and proinflammatory (cluster 4) ( Figures 3 D–3F). The cells were ordered in low dimensional space from quiescent to migratory and then split from migratory cells into proliferating cells (following the cell cycle; Figure S4 A), CD8-like cells, and proinflammatory cells ( Figure 3 B). Cells in quiescent cluster 0 highly expressed genes associated with T cell quiescence (e.g., Samhd1 , Il7r , Tcf7 , and Btg1 [ Hwang et al., 2020 30. Hwang, S.S. ∙ Lim, J. ∙ Yu, Z. ... mRNA destabilization by BTG1 and BTG2 maintains T cell quiescence Science. 2020; 367 :1255-1260 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ]) and had the lowest number of detected transcripts per cell, supporting a quiescent cell state ( Figure S4 B). Cells in migratory cluster 1 highly expressed genes involved in cell migration ( Ltb4r1 , Cxcr6 , Vasp ) and morphology ( Tmsb10 , Cotl1 ), suggesting these cells recently migrated into the CNS. Proliferating cluster 2 cells highly expressed cell-cycle genes ( Birc5 , Cks1b , Cdk1 , Mki67 ).
Interestingly, CD8-like cells (cluster 3) expressed Cd4 and CD8 + T cell markers ( Nkg7 , Ccl5 , Cd8a ) and cytotoxic ( Prf1 , Gzmk ) genes. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of a small TCRβ + CD4 + tdTomato + CD8 + population that expressed CD8-like and cytotoxic genes ( Figures 3 G and 3H). Notably, we and others have recently reported such CD8 + IL17-expressing cells in inflammatory bowel disease in humans ( Tom et al., 2016 84. Tom, M.R. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Ueno, A. ... Novel CD8+ T-Cell Subsets Demonstrating Plasticity in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2016; 22 :1596-1608 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smillie et al., 2019 77. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, emergence of CD8-like Th17 cells might be a common phenomenon in T cell-driven autoimmune tissue inflammation.
Most notably, we identified a cell subset (cluster 4) of highly proinflammatory, activated, and expanded cells, enriched for current Th17 cells in the CNS. Specifically, cells in proinflammatory cluster 4 expressed the highest levels of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, and activation markers including co-inhibitory receptors ( Tnfrsf9 , Ifng , Csf2 , Lag3 , Il17a , Pdcd1 ) ( Schnell et al., 2020 72. Schnell, A. ∙ Bod, L. ∙ Madi, A. ... The yin and yang of co-inhibitory receptors: toward anti-tumor immunity without autoimmunity Cell Res. 2020; 30 :285-299 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 D and 3E) were the most clonally expanded (by TCR analysis) ( Figure 3 I), had the highest proportion of current Th17 cells (GFP + ) ( Figure S4 C), the highest Il17a GFP expression ( Figure 3 D) (FDR < 0.0001), and had the largest number of transcripts per cells (except for proliferating cluster 2 cells) ( Figure S4 B). To confirm the presence of the cluster 4 cell population in the CNS during EAE, we predicted (by COMET [ Delaney et al., 2019 13. Delaney, C. ∙ Schnell, A. ∙ Cammarata, L.V. ... Combinatorial prediction of marker panels from single-cell transcriptomic data Mol. Syst. Biol. 2019; 15 :e9005 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ]) and validated PD-1 as a highly expressed surface marker in cluster 4 cells ( Figure S4 D), consistent with observations that PD-1 is highly expressed on activated effector cells ( Riley, 2009 65. Riley, J.L. PD-1 signaling in primary T cells Immunol. Rev. 2009; 229 :114-125 Crossref Scopus (628) PubMed Google Scholar ). PD-1 marked highly proinflammatory Th17 cells that produced high levels of IL-17A, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF cytokines associated with encephalitogenicity ( Figures 3 J and 3K).
To study the mechanism and role of tissue Th17 cells in the induction of EAE, we focused on Th17 cells in peripheral tissues and examined all 84,124 tissue Th17 cells from both naive and EAE mice. Similar to our analyses at homeostasis, control and EAE cells grouped together primarily by tissue-origin rather than treatment, suggesting that the tissue Th17 signatures are stronger discriminants than expression changes induced upon EAE immunization ( Figures 4 A and 4B; Figures S4 E and S4F). While cells of intestinal tissues from naive or EAE mice were well mixed and had only few differentially expressed genes between the conditions (SI [COL] 30 [10] genes upregulated, 23 [32] genes downregulated; FDR <0.05, fold change ≥1.5), splenic Th17 cells were clearly more distinguishable between the two conditions ( Figures 4 B–4D; Figures S4 G–S4I), with a larger number of differentially expressed genes (58 up- and 58 downregulated, Figure S4 H).
Next, we used TCR sequences of the Th17 cells in EAE-diseased mice to understand the relationship between Th17 cells across all tissues and the encephalitogenic Th17 population. Only a handful of clonotypes were shared across mice during EAE (12 of 5,278 [0.2%] clonotypes; only one clonotype in two mice in the CNS; Table S3 A,C), whereas 5%–35% of the clonotypes were shared between tissues in the same mouse. TCR repertoire similarity analysis across tissues ( Figures 4 E and 4F) revealed a Th17 population with high clonal similarity between cells from the DLN, SPL, and CNS, indicating that these clonotypes may be the main disease-driving population, and a Th17 population with high clonal similarity in the intestinal tissues (MLN, PP, SI, COL). Recent studies highlight the role of the “gut-brain axis” in which intestinal Th17 cells have been suggested, by an unknown mechanism, to regulate CNS autoimmune inflammation ( Lee et al., 2011 47. Lee, Y.K. ∙ Menezes, J.S. ∙ Umesaki, Y. ... Proinflammatory T-cell responses to gut microbiota promote experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :4615-4622 Crossref Scopus (1062) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miyauchi et al., 2020 57. Miyauchi, E. ∙ Kim, S.W. ∙ Suda, W. ... Gut microorganisms act together to exacerbate inflammation in spinal cords Nature. 2020; 585 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cosorich et al., 2017 11. Cosorich, I. ∙ Dalla-Costa, G. ∙ Sorini, C. ... High frequency of intestinal T H 17 cells correlates with microbiota alterations and disease activity in multiple sclerosis Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1700492 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our results suggest a model where Th17 cells are induced in the DLN and then traffic to the CNS via SPL.
To address the potential role of the intestinal Th17 population in EAE disease, we compared the TCR sequences of intestinal Th17 cells to other tissue Th17 cells. Interestingly, we identified a minor population of Th17 cells in the spleen that shared TCR clonotypic structures with gut-associated Th17 cells in the MLN, PP, SI, and COL ( Figures 4 E and 4F). We concluded that there may be two different clonally related Th17 communities in the SPL, one that shared clonotypes with DLN and CNS cells (26.2% of the SPL cells), and a second, smaller, community in the SPL (10.6% of the SPL cells) that shared clonotypes with Th17 cells from intestinal tissues. We thus hypothesized that the SPL is potentially a key hub, serving as a source for disseminating both intestinal Th17 cells and encephalitogenic Th17 cells.
Further analysis of splenic Th17 cell heterogeneity during EAE showed that most cells (85%) were in one of two clusters, resembling either homeostatic non-pathogenic Th17 cells (SPL0) or pathogenic Th17 cells (SPL1) ( Figures 5 A–5C), based on expression of known genes and signatures ( Lee et al., 2012 48. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gaublomme et al., 2015 18. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ... Single-Cell Genomics Unveils Critical Regulators of Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1400-1412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ), with pathogenic-like SPL1 cells being substantially more clonally expanded ( Figure 5 D). Among the genes upregulated in the homeostatic Th17 cells ( Figure 5 E) were both those previously associated with non-pathogenic Th17 cells ( Ccr6 , Il6ra , Ikzf3 , Maf ) ( Figure 5 B), and genes expressed in stem-like CD8 + T cells ( Tcf7 , Cxcr5 ) described in tumors and during LCMV infections ( Im et al., 2016 31.

Conversely, SPL1 cells expressed high levels of genes that we and others have previously associated with pathogenic Th17 cells ( Ifng , Tbx21 , Bhlhe40 , Csf2 ) ( Gaublomme et al., 2015 18. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ...

Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We identified SLAMF6 + and CXCR6 + as two cell-surface molecules that could distinguish the SPL0 and SPL1 populations ( Figure 5 E) and validated them as markers of SPL0 and SPL1 cells, respectively, by sorting of SLAMF6 + and CXCR6 + tdTomato + CD4 + T cells from the spleens of EAE-diseased mice followed by bulk RNA-seq, showing that their associated signatures ( Table S4 ) were expressed in SPL0 and SPL1 cells, respectively ( Figure 5 F). SLAMF6 + cells are present in the spleen at high proportion during homeostasis and reduced in EAE, whereas CXCR6 + cells increase dramatically in the spleen and CNS during EAE disease, with a temporary peak in the spleen, followed by a steady rise in the CNS ( Figures 5 G and 5H). The bulk CXCR6 + signature was positively correlated with scRNA-seq profiles of pathogenic encephalitogenic T cells from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from MS patients ( Schafflick et al., 2020 70. Schafflick, D. ∙ Xu, C.A. ∙ Hartlehnert, M. ... Integrated single cell analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes in multiple sclerosis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :247 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S5 A–S5C). Notably, the SLAMF6 + and CXCR6 + signatures also marked distinct cell populations in scRNA-seq profiles of tdTomato + CD4 + T cells from mice with DSS-induced colitis, suggesting potential broader implications of our findings to other inflammatory conditions ( Figure S5 D).
Splenic SLAMF6 + and CXCR6 + populations had distinct chromatin accessibility landscapes (by ATAC sequencing [ATAC-seq]), with 17,449 differentially accessible regions (FDR <0.05, fold change ≥2) ( Figure 5 I), supporting their separate identity. Gene loci involved in the homeostatic and stem-like Th17 cell phenotype ( Il6ra , Ccr7 , Ccr6 , Slamf6 , Tcf7 , Cxcr5 ) were specifically accessible in the SLAMF6 + population, and loci involved in Th17 pathogenicity ( Ifngr1 , Nkg7 , Tbx21 , Cxcr6 , Bhlhe40 , Csf2 , Ifng ) were specifically accessible in the CXCR6 + population ( Figure 5 J).
Thus, we identified two splenic Th17 cell populations with distinct expression and chromatin accessibility profiles that resemble a homeostatic stem-like and a pathogenic Th17 cell population and are marked by the surface markers SLAMF6 and CXCR6, respectively.
Based on our discovery of two clonally related Th17 communities, we hypothesized that SPL0 (homeostatic) and SPL1 (pathogenic) cells represent gut-associated and encephalitogenic Th17 communities in the spleen, respectively. Indeed, the SPL0 cells showed TCR repertoire similarity to Th17 cells in all tissues, whereas SPL1 cells shared TCRs almost exclusively with Th17 cells in the DLN and the CNS ( Figures 6 A and 6B). SPL0 cells highly expressed genes involved in immune cell migration and retention in lymphoid tissues ( Cxcr5 , Ccr7 , Sell ) and to the intestine ( Ccr9 , Itga4 ), whereas SPL1 cells expressed genes involved in immune cell trafficking to sites of inflammation ( Ccr5 , Itgb1 , Crip1 , Cxcr6 , Ccr2 ) ( Figure 6 C).
TCR similarity analysis across all tissue clusters at homeostasis and EAE revealed patterns of clonotype sharing ( Figure 6 D). Specifically, at homeostasis, cell clusters from the same tissue shared clonotypes, indicating high clonality (and plasticity) within each tissue and that TCR specificity is a main factor dictating the homing and expansion of tissue Th17 cells. Using the GLIPH2 algorithm ( Huang et al., 2020 28. Huang, H. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Rubelt, F. ... Analyzing the Mycobacterium tuberculosis immune response by T-cell receptor clustering with GLIPH2 and genome-wide antigen screening Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1194-1202 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ), which groups TCRs that may recognize the same epitope based on shared similarity in the CDR3 regions, we identified 190 tissue-specific TCR groups ( Figure S6 A), indicating that different Th17 clonotypes in a tissue recognize the same antigen. Homeostatic SLAMF6 + SPL0 cells had high clonal similarities with clusters across all tissues ( Figure 6 D). In EAE, comparing clonotypes across the cell clusters defined in each tissue ( Figures S6 B–S6D), there were high similarities between clonotypes in SPL, DLN, and CNS cell clusters, and (separately) between SPL, MLN, PP, SI, and COL cell clusters ( Figure 6 D), reflecting the disease-driving and the homeostatic (gut-associated) communities ( Figures 4 E and 4F) of tissue Th17 cells. Strikingly, only SPL0 cells shared considerable TCR repertoires with both communities in EAE, whereas SPL1 cells exhibited close TCR sharing with all clusters from the SPL, DLN, and CNS. SPL1 exhibited strong TCR sharing with all CNS clusters, indicating that SPL1 is connected to all Th17 cell phenotypes in the CNS ( Figure 3 ). Notably, one small SI cluster (SI5) grouped with the disease-driving ecosystem ( Figure 6 D) and highly expressed migratory genes ( Figures S6 E and S6F). A small proportion of similar cells expressing the migratory signature were detected in every tissue except SPL during EAE ( Figures S6 G and S6H), suggesting these cells are a systemic migratory Th17 subpopulation present in all tissues following EAE induction.
Based on these findings, we hypothesized that CXCR6 + SPL1 Th17 cells migrate to the CNS following induction of EAE. Supporting our hypothesis, we detected CXCR6 + tdTomato + cells in the blood of mice immunized for EAE, and their frequency increased over time post-immunization ( Figure S7 A). Moreover, the expression of Cxcl16 , encoding the ligand for CXCR6, was significantly higher in immune cells in the CNS than in the spleen during EAE, supporting a model in which the recruitment of CXCR6 + cells from the spleen to the CNS via the blood is driven by a CXCL16 gradient ( Figure S7 B ) .
To validate that SPL0 and SPL1 cells have distinct migratory behaviors in vivo during EAE, we sorted and adoptively transferred SLAMF6 + and CXCR6 + SPL cells obtained from mice with activate EAE into congenically marked mice that were immunized for EAE 7 days prior to the transfer and harvested the cells from each tissue 7 days post-transfer (14 days post-EAE immunization). The CXCR6 + transferred population was only found in the CNS, DLN, and SPL, while the SLAMF6 + population was present in all tissues including intestinal tissues, confirming the distinct migratory profile of SPL0 and SPL1 in vivo during EAE ( Figure 6 E).
Based on previous studies indicating that intestinal Th17 cells can influence the development of EAE ( Lee et al., 2011 47. Lee, Y.K. ∙ Menezes, J.S. ∙ Umesaki, Y. ...

Cosorich, I. ∙ Dalla-Costa, G. ∙ Sorini, C. ... High frequency of intestinal T H 17 cells correlates with microbiota alterations and disease activity in multiple sclerosis Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1700492 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that the stem-like, intestinal TCF1 + SLAMF6 + SPL0 cells could give rise to pathogenic SPL1 cells and replenish them during EAE.
To test our hypothesis, we first analyzed the extent of TCR repertoire sharing between SPL0 and SPL1 cells and found that there is substantial sharing of clones between them ( Figure 6 F), spanning ∼20% of SPL0 cells and ∼50% of SPL1 cells. SPL0 cells spanned a diverse TCR repertoire with fewer expanded clones, consistent with a homeostatic population induced by diverse agents (such as microbiota or EAE immunization), whereas SPL1 had a less diverse but more expanded repertoire. The shared clonotypes were highly expanded in SPL1 compared to SPL0 cells. Indeed, a higher proliferation signature is observed in SPL1 versus SPL0 cells ( Figure S7 C).
To test for in vivo conversion of SPL0 to SPL1 cells, we transferred either SLAMF6 + or CXCR6 + cells from mice with EAE into congenically marked immunized recipient mice, as above ( Figure 6 G). Following transfer of SLAMF6 + donor cells, we recovered both SLAMF6 + and CXCR6 + cells, confirming the ability of SLAMF6 + cells to give rise to CXCR6 + cells in vivo . In contrast, following transfer of CXCR6 + donor cells, we recovered only CXCR6 + cells in recipients’ spleens, but little to no SLAMF6 + cells, suggesting that the CXCR6 + cells exhibit a terminal effector cell phenotype. The transfer of CXCR6 + cells exacerbated EAE disease ( Figure S7 D), supporting CXCR6 + cells as the pathogenic population during EAE.
To test whether the SLAMF6 + population may be maintained by the gut microbiota, we eliminated intestinal microbes with a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (VMNA) ( Wu et al., 2010 90. Wu, H.J. ∙ Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Darce, J. ... Gut-residing segmented filamentous bacteria drive autoimmune arthritis via T helper 17 cells Immunity. 2010; 32 :815-827 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1294) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antibiotics (Abx)-treatment led on average to an ∼9-fold reduction of tdTomato + Th17 cells in all tissues, including a corresponding proportional reduction of splenic SLAMF6 + cells ( Figures S7 E and S7F), suggesting that the homeostatic SLAMF6 + population is maintained by the presence of the gut microbiota. Mice that were Abx-treated and immunized for EAE were resistant to EAE ( Figure S7 G) and showed a substantial reduction of both SLAMF6 + and CXCR6 + cells in the spleens ( Figure S7 H), suggesting that lack of SLAMF6 + to CXCR6 + conversion may contribute to EAE resistance in gut-microbiota-depleted mice.
Finally, we directly validated the migration and conversion of intestinal cells to CXCR6 + cells in the spleen and CNS by performing photoconversion experiments using Kaede mice, which ubiquitously express a photoconvertible fluorescent protein ( Tomura et al., 2008 85. Tomura, M. ∙ Yoshida, N. ∙ Tanaka, J. ... Monitoring cellular movement in vivo with photoconvertible fluorescence protein “Kaede” transgenic mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :10871-10876 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). After photoconversion of intestinal cells in immunized mice, we detected photoconverted CXCR6 + CD4 + T cells in the spleen and CNS ( Figure 6 H), that expressed IFN-γ and GM-CSF (data not shown), confirming that intestinal cells are the reservoir for pathogenic CXCR6 + cells that migrate to the CNS to drive neuroinflammation.
It is currently unclear whether IL-17-producing Th17 cells or a unique subset of GM-CSF- and IFN-γ-producing T cells are the critical pathogenic cells driving autoimmune tissue inflammation ( Ghoreschi et al., 2010 20. Ghoreschi, K. ∙ Laurence, A. ∙ Yang, X.P. ...

GM-CSF and CXCR4 define a T helper cell signature in multiple sclerosis Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1290-1300 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). To shed light on this question, we examined the expression patterns of genes encoding for key cytokines in scRNA-seq of the homeostatic SLAMF6 + and the pathogenic CXCR6 + cells.
Interestingly, a significantly higher proportion of SPL0 cells expressed Il17a , Il17f , and Il2 , whereas a higher proportion of SPL1 cells expressed Csf2 and Ifng ( Figure 7 A). This cytokine gene expression was confirmed as antigen-specific by MOG recall assay, as SLAMF6 + cells exhibited increased IL-17A and IL-2 positivity after ex vivo stimulation with MOG 35–55 peptide, while CXCR6 + cells displayed a dramatically increase in GM-CSF and IFN-γ positivity and expression level after peptide stimulation ( Figure 7 B; Figure S7 I ) . This suggests a role for both IL-17-producing Th17 cells and GM-CSF- and IFN-γ-producing T cells in induction of EAE, such that a homeostatic IL-17 + population gives rise to GM-CSF + IFN-γ + T cells. Moreover, there is a higher fraction of IFNGR1-expressing proinflammatory CXCR6 + SPL1 cells ( Figure 7 C), suggesting an autocrine positive feedback loop mediated by IFN-γ in expanding or maintaining the SPL1 phenotype ( Schneider et al., 2014 71. Schneider, W.M. ∙ Chevillotte, M.D. ∙ Rice, C.M. Interferon-stimulated genes: a complex web of host defenses Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 32 :513-545 Crossref Scopus (2126) PubMed Google Scholar ).
IL-23 signaling plays a pivotal role in autoimmune pathogenesis ( Cua et al., 2003 12. Cua, D.J. ∙ Sherlock, J. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Interleukin-23 rather than interleukin-12 is the critical cytokine for autoimmune inflammation of the brain Nature. 2003; 421 :744-748 Crossref Scopus (2456) PubMed Google Scholar ; Murphy et al., 2003 58. Murphy, C.A. ∙ Langrish, C.L. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Divergent pro- and antiinflammatory roles for IL-23 and IL-12 in joint autoimmune inflammation J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198 :1951-1957 Crossref Scopus (1434) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is required for the generation of pathogenic T cells ( Langrish et al., 2005 45. Langrish, C.L. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Blumenschein, W.M. ... IL-23 drives a pathogenic T cell population that induces autoimmune inflammation J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201 :233-240 Crossref Scopus (3400) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2012 48. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the mechanism by which it drives the generation of pathogenic T cells remains unclear. Interestingly, the receptor for IL-23 (IL-23R) is expressed in a higher proportion of SPL0 than SPL1 cells ( Figure 7 D), while there was a higher expression of the IL-23 signature in SPL1 cells and higher chromatin accessibility at gene loci downstream of IL-23R signaling in CXCR6 + versus SLAMF6 + cells ( Figures S7 J and S7K), suggesting greater IL-23R signaling in CXCR6 + cells. We thus hypothesized that IL-23R signaling may mediate the conversion of SLAMF6 + to CXCR6 + cells. To test our hypothesis, we co-cultured SLAMF6 + cells with splenocytes in vitro and treated them with IL-23 ( Figure 7 E). The proportion of SLAMF6 + cells decreased in the presence of IL-23, whereas the proportion of GM-CSF + , IFN-γ + , and CXCR6 + cells increased, suggesting an IL-23R signaling-mediated conversion of homeostatic stem-like Th17 cells into pathogenic CXCR6 + cells. As putative sources of IL-23 during EAE, we identified dendritic cells in the spleen and monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in the CNS as the immune populations expressing highest levels of Il12b and Il23a transcripts ( Figures S7 L and S7M).
Finally, to characterize the effect of IL-23R signaling on the generation of pathogenic CXCR6 + cells in vivo , we generated IL-23R conditional knockout mice ( Il23r fl/fl ; STAR Methods ) and induced EAE in Il17a Cre Il23r fl/fl mice, where IL-23R is specifically deleted in Th17 cells. We found an increased frequency of SLAMF6 + cells and significant reduction in CXCR6 + cells in the spleen compared to wild-type littermate controls ( Figure 7 F), and, consistently, fewer tdTomato + CD4 + T cells in the CNS, and fewer of those cells expressed GM-CSF and IFN-γ ( Figure 7 G), and there was resistance of the mice to the induction of EAE ( Figure 7 H). Bulk RNA-seq of Il17a Cre Il23r fl/fl CXCR6 + cells revealed substantial expression changes in the CXCR6 + population without IL-23R signaling (34 genes upregulated, 120 genes downregulated; FDR <0.05; Table S5 ), including downregulation of gene signatures involved in Th17 pathogenicity ( Figures S7 N and S7O). In conclusion, these data suggest that IL-23R signaling mediates the generation of pathogenic CXCR6 + cells from SLAMF6 + cells.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we analyzed the expression landscape and connectivity of tissue Th17 cells during homeostasis and CNS autoimmunity and provide a mechanism by which Th17 cells from the intestine contribute to CNS pathogenesis.
The homeostatic SLAMF6 + cell population shows multiple parallels to previously described stem-like CD8 + T cells in tumors and during LCMV infections ( Im et al., 2016 31.

Moreover, stem-like CD8 + T cells are characterized by their ability to undergo self-renewal and to differentiate into effector and terminally exhausted CD8 + T cells ( Im et al., 2016 31. Im, S.J. ∙ Hashimoto, M. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. ...

Analogously, we found that stem-like SLAMF6 + population can give rise to pathogenic CXCR6 + Th17 cells. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that in CD4 + T cell-driven autoimmune diseases, stem-like SLAMF6 + cells act as a tissue-dwelling reservoir for the generation of numerous pathogenic T cells, contributing to and further amplifying tissue inflammation.
Recent studies have highlighted a critical role of the intestinal microbiota in the development of extra-intestinal autoimmune diseases ( Berer et al., 2011 3.

USA. 2017; 114 :10719-10724 Crossref Scopus (634) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the induction of intestinal Th17 cells by gut microbes has been suggested as the mechanism ( Lee et al., 2011 47. Lee, Y.K. ∙ Menezes, J.S. ∙ Umesaki, Y. ... Proinflammatory T-cell responses to gut microbiota promote experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :4615-4622 Crossref Scopus (1062) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miyauchi et al., 2020 57. Miyauchi, E. ∙ Kim, S.W. ∙ Suda, W. ...

Adv. 2017; 3 :e1700492 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ). The conversion of the SLAMF6 + Th17 cell population that is maintained by gut microbiota to the CXCR6 + cells might provide a potential connection between the gut microbiota-induced Th17 population and the pathogenic Th17 population in the CNS. Building on previous work demonstrating cross-reactivity of microbiota-induced Th17 cells to autoantigens like MOG ( Miyauchi et al., 2020 57. Miyauchi, E. ∙ Kim, S.W. ∙ Suda, W. ... Gut microorganisms act together to exacerbate inflammation in spinal cords Nature. 2020; 585 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bradley et al., 2017 7.

Notably, since our study was focused on intestinal tissues, we cannot exclude the possibility that SLAMF6 + cells might migrate to other mucosal sites (lungs) or other tissues where host microbiota can maintain them.
One open question in the field concerns the relative roles of IL-17-producing T cells versus GM-CSF-producing T cells in driving autoimmune tissue inflammation ( Ghoreschi et al., 2010 20.

GM-CSF and CXCR4 define a T helper cell signature in multiple sclerosis Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1290-1300 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). We discovered the conversion of SLAMF6 + to CXCR6 + cells to be accompanied by downregulation of an IL-17 program and upregulation of a pathogenic GM-CSF and IFN-γ program. Thus, our results suggest that IL-17-producing T cells are the progenitors of GM-CSF- and IFN-γ-producing T cells, directly relating the two effector T cell populations in a model where both are sequentially involved in the development of autoimmune disease.
In conclusion, our study provides mechanistic insights that may apply to various autoimmune contexts, and targeting the stem-like intestinal Th17 population and IL-23R signaling could allow for better therapeutic control over the chronicity and relapses observed across many human autoimmune conditions ( Rosenblum et al., 2015 67. Rosenblum, M.D. ∙ Remedios, K.A. ∙ Abbas, A.K. Mechanisms of human autoimmunity J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :2228-2233 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The TCR analysis statistics in this study, including clonal expansion and clonal similarity score, may have residual dependencies on the number of cells even after normalization.
Concerning the study design, our study is focused on the Th17 lineage including all CD4 + T cells that ever-expressed Il17a and therefore does not account for other T cell lineages that are likely to play important roles in autoimmune disorders, including Th1 cells and T reg cells.

C57BL/6- Il17a tm1Bcgen /J (named Il17a GFP ), Il17a tm1.1(icre)Stck /J (named Il17a Cre ), B6;129S6- Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze /J (named Rosa26 tdTomato ), and B6.SJL- Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ (named CD45.1) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Foxp3 tm1Kuch (named Foxp3 GFP ) mice were generated in the V.K.K. laboratory ( Bettelli et al., 2006 5. Bettelli, E. ∙ Carrier, Y. ∙ Gao, W. ... Reciprocal developmental pathways for the generation of pathogenic effector TH17 and regulatory T cells Nature. 2006; 441 :235-238 Crossref Scopus (5881) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tg(CAG-Kaede)15Kgwa mice (named Kaede, ( Tomura et al., 2008 85. Tomura, M. ∙ Yoshida, N. ∙ Tanaka, J. ... Monitoring cellular movement in vivo with photoconvertible fluorescence protein “Kaede” transgenic mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :10871-10876 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar )) on C57BL/6J background were obtained from RIKEN BRC, Japan. To generate conditional IL-23 receptor knockout mice (named Il23r fl/fl ) we took advantage of a recently established ES cell resource ( Skarnes et al., 2011 76. Skarnes, W.C. ∙ Rosen, B. ∙ West, A.P. ... A conditional knockout resource for the genome-wide study of mouse gene function Nature. 2011; 474 :337-342 Crossref Scopus (1296) PubMed Google Scholar ). ES cell clone EPD0812_2_C11 with a targeted IL-23 receptor allele (containing a neomycin selectable marker flanked by frt sites) with conditional potential was acquired from EuMMCR (European Mouse Mutant Cell Repository; https://www.eummcr.org/ ) within EUCOMM (European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program). This ES cell clone was used for blastocyst injections. Faithful targeting of the IL-23 receptor allele was confirmed in the ES clone prior to blastocyst injections by Southern blot analysis. Chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6 mice and offspring screened for germline transmission by PCR for the neomycin selectable marker cassette. Offspring harboring the targeted IL-23 receptor neo+ allele were then bred to Flpo deleter mice ( Kranz et al., 2010 42. Kranz, A. ∙ Fu, J. ∙ Duerschke, K. ... An improved Flp deleter mouse in C57Bl/6 based on Flpo recombinase Genesis. 2010; 48 :512-520 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Offspring carrying the final conditional IL-23 receptor allele (2lox) were bred to C57BL/6 to remove the Flpo transgene. The IL-23 receptor conditional allele was bred to homozygosity and then to various Cre strains to obtain tissue/cell-type specific deletion of IL-23 receptor. The primers TCCAGAGACGCCTGTACTCA and CACCAAGCTTTTCTCCTCCTC are used for routine genotyping (wt = 414bp and 2lox = 577bp). For experiments, mice were sex- and age- matched (8–12 weeks old) and littermates were used as controls.
Mice were housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions (SPF) at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital mouse facility in Boston. All experiments that involved the use of mice were performed in accordance with the guidelines outlined by the Brigham and Women’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in Boston.
For active induction of EAE, mice were immunized subcutaneously in the flanks with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide MOG 35-55 (100 μg/mouse, Genemed Synthesis), emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) (200 μl/mouse, Becton Dickinson), and supplemented with Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra extract (5 mg/ml, Becton Dickinson). Pertussis toxin (100 ng/mouse, List Biological Laboratories) was administered intravenously into the tail vein on day 0 and day 2 post immunization. Disease course was monitored daily, and mice were assigned a clinical score as follows: 0, healthy; 1, limp tail; 2, hind limb weakness or impaired righting reflex; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, hind and front limb paralysis; 5, moribund or dead. Mice with a clinical score > 4 were euthanized.
Colitis was induced by adding 2% DSS (Affymetrix) to the drinking water on days 0-7, followed by a two-day recovery period with normal drinking water. The disease progression was monitored by measurement of the body weight.
Immediately after weaning, 3- to 4- week-old littermates were administrated weekly with 1 g/L of Ampicillin sodium salt (Sigma Aldrich), 1 g/L of Metronidazole (Acros Organics), 0.5 g/L Vancomycin hydrochloride (Research products international), and 1 g/l of Neomycin sulfate (Thermo Fischer Scientific) in the drinking water as previously described ( Wu et al., 2010 90. Wu, H.J. ∙ Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Darce, J. ... Gut-residing segmented filamentous bacteria drive autoimmune arthritis via T helper 17 cells Immunity. 2010; 32 :815-827 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1294) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sweetener (Equal) was added to the water (2.5 g/L) of the experimental group and the control group. For analysis at homeostasis, mice were treated with antibiotics for 6 weeks. For analysis during EAE, mice were treated with antibiotics starting 2-weeks prior to immunization and through the disease course.
For photoconversion of intestinal tissues (MLN, PP, COL, and SI), mice were anaesthetized and a small cut was made into the peritoneal cavity. The intestinal tissues were carefully extended and exposed to 405 nm violet light using a 200 mW Electra Pro portable laser (Laserglow Technologies) for a total of 4 mins (one min each tissue) with continuous wetting of the tissues with PBS. The surrounding tissues were covered with sterile aluminum foil to protect against unspecific photoconversion. After returning the intestinal tissues into the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneum was sutured, and the skin closed with surgical staples. Mice were euthanized 48 h after the procedure and the biodistribution of the photoconverted red protein was analyzed by flow cytometry.
For tissue harvest, mice were perfused intracardially with cold PBS. Lymphoid tissues, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested and smashed through 40 μm sterile strainers. ACK lysis (Buffer from Lonza) was performed with the spleen for 5 min at RT. Peyer’s patches were digested for 20 min at 37°C in a water bath in digestion buffer (5% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mg/ml Collagenase Type VIII (Sigma Aldrich), 2 mM CaCl 2 (Sigma Aldrich), 5 mM MgCl 2 (Sigma Aldrich) in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific)) and smashed through a 40 μm sterile strainer. To isolate cells from the small intestine and the colon, intestinal tissues were harvested and cleaned. Epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes were removed by incubating the tissues for 20 min at 37°C with constant stirring at 350 rpm in extraction buffer (5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM DTT (Thermo Fischer Scientific), 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific)). Tissues were minced and incubated in digestion buffer for 40 min at 37°C with constant stirring at 550 rpm and smashed through a 40 μm sterile strainer. To isolate CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes from EAE mice, brain and spinal cord were flushed out with PBS by hydrostatic pressure. The CNS was minced and digested in 2.5 mg/ml Collagenase D (Roche Diagnostics) in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20 min at 37°C. Cells were smashed through a 40 μm sterile cell strainer and mononuclear cells were enriched on a discontinuous (37% and 70%) Percoll gradient (Cytiva). To analyze blood cells, mice were bled on the cheek and red blood cells were removed in two rounds of 5 min ACK lysis (Buffer from Lonza) at room temperature (RT). After tissue cell isolation, cells were stained for flow cytometry.
Single-cell suspensions were stained in flow buffer (2% fetal bovine serum in PBS) with antibodies for surface proteins. Antibodies with specificity for the following cell surface proteins were purchased from Biolegend with different fluorochrome labels: CD45 (clone 3-F11), CD4 (clone RM4-5), TCRβ (clone H57-597), PD-L1 (clone 10F.9G2), CXCR6 (clone SA051D1), SLAMF6 (clone 330-AJ), CD8a (clone 53-6.7), PD-1 (clone 29F.1A12), NK1.1 (clone PK136), Ly-6C (clone HK1.4), I-A/E (clone M5/114.15.2), CD64 (clone X54-5/7.1), CD11b (clone M1/70), CD19 (clone 6D5), Gr1 (clone RB6-8C5), CD44 (clone IM7). The anti-mouse CD11c (clone N418) antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Cells were stained for viability using eF506 dye (eBioscience).
Surface antibody staining was performed for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. The following cell populations were identified in spleen and CNS based on cell marker expression: CD4 + T cells (CD45 + TCRβ + CD4 + ), activated CD4 + T cells (CD45 + TCRβ + CD4 + CD44 + ), CD8 + T cells (CD45 + TCRβ + CD8 + ), activated CD8 + T cells (CD45 + TCRβ + CD8 + CD44 + ), Th17 cells (CD45 + TCRβ + CD4 + IL-17A-GFP + ), B cells (CD45 + CD19 + ), natural killer (NK) cells (CD45 + NK1.1 + ), neutrophils (CD45 + CD11b + Ly-6C int Gr1 + ), dendritic cells (DCs) (CD45 + CD11c + I-A/E high ), macrophages (MACS) (CD45 + CD11b + Ly-6C - Gr1 - CD64 + ), monocytes (CD45 + CD11b + Gr1 - CD64 - Ly-6C low or high ), microglia (CD11b + CD64 + CD44 - CD45 int ).
For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were activated for 4 h at 37°C with the Cell Stimulation Cocktail (plus protein transport inhibitors) (eBioscience) and fixed and stained using the Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Biosciences) per manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies with specificity for the following intracellular proteins were purchased from Biolegend with different fluorochrome labels: IFNγ (clone XMG1.2), GM-CSF (clone MP1-22E9), IL-17A (clone TC11-18H10.1), IL-2 (clone JES6-5H4). The anti-AREG antibody (clone 206220, R&D Systems) was conjugated to Pacific Blue according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes). Intracellular/intranuclear antibody staining was performed for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.
Flow cytometry analysis and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) was performed on a BD LSRII (BD Biosciences) or BD LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). FACS was performed on a BD FACS Aria IIIu flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The data was analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar) and GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad).
Active EAE was induced in 8- to 12-week-old Il17aCre GFP X Rosa26 tdTomato littermates and spleens were isolated 14 days post immunization. Viable TCRβ + CD4 + tdTomato + SLAMF6 + or CXCR6 + populations were purified by FACS following MACS bead isolation of CD4 + cells (Miltenyi Biotec). 4x10 4 cells were subsequently intravenously transferred into CD45.1 recipient mice that have been immunized for active EAE 7 days prior to the transfer. 7 days post transfer tissues were isolated, and flow cytometry was performed as described above.
8- to 12-week-old Il17aCre GFP X Rosa26 tdTomato littermates were immunized for EAE induction. At 14 days post immunization, viable TCRβ + CD4 + tdTomato + SLAMF6 + or CXCR6 + populations were purified by MACS bead isolation of CD4 + cells followed by FACS. 2x10 4 SLAMF6 + or CXCR6 + cells were in vitro restimulated with 50 μg MOG 35-55 peptide and 1x10 5 CD4 - splenocytes for 3 days. Cells were harvested for intracellular cytokine staining.
For in vitro treatment of SLAMF6 + cells with IL-23, 2x10 4 SLAMF6 + cells were co-cultured with 2x10 5 CD4 - splenocytes with or without IL-23 (20 ng/mL, R&D Systems, Cat# 1887-ML-010) for 3 days.
Cytokine concentrations in the culture medium of the recall assay were determined by the LegendPlex Mouse Inflammation Panel (13-plex) (Biolegend, Cat# 740446) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were acquired with a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using the LegendPlex Data Analysis Software Suite.
Total RNA was extracted using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription of mRNA was performed with the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) in a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). qPCR was conducted using the TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to the expression of 18S rRNA and Actb . The following TaqMan probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used: Ifit1 (Mm00515153_m1), Ifit3 (Mm01704846_s1), Irf7 (Mm00516793_g1), Isg15 (Mm01705338_s1), Isg20 (Mm00469585_m1), Zbp1 (Mm01247052_m1), Nkg7 (Cat# Mm01205900_g1), Ccl5 (Cat# Mm01302427_m1), Cd8a (Cat# Mm01182107_g1), Prf1 (Cat# Mm00812512_m1), Gzmk (Cat# Mm00492530_m1), Cxcl16 (Cat# Mm00469712_m1), Il12b (Cat# Mm01288989_m1), Il23a (Cat# Mm00518984_m1), 18S (Cat# 4352930E), and Actb (Cat# 4352341E). Relative expression levels are depicted as 2 -ΔCT values, ΔCT = (gene of interest CT) - (geoMean Housekeeper CT).
For analysis at homeostasis, 8- to 12-week-old Il17aCre GFP X Rosa26 tdTomato female littermates were used. For analysis during EAE disease, active EAE was induced in 8- to 12-week-old Il17aCre GFP X Rosa26 tdTomato littermates as described above. Mice were harvested at disease onset (clinical score of 1). Viable CD4 + TCRβ + tdTomato + tissue Th17 cells were sorted by FACS for sequencing.
Cell hashing was performed with samples for scRNA/TCR-seq to process all tissues of one mouse together in one 10x channel. After the sort, cells were resuspended in flow buffer with the TotalSeq™-antibody pool (Biolegend) at 1:1000 final dilution for each antibody, followed by incubation for 30 min on ice. Next, cells were washed for a total of three washes with flow buffer.
Samples for scRNA/TCR-Seq with 5′ feature barcoding were then separated into droplet emulsions using the Chromium Single Cell 5′ V2 Solution, according to manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics). For samples that did not include scTCR-seq and 5′ feature barcoding, sorted cells were separated into droplet emulsions using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Solution (v2 or v3) according to manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics). scRNA-seq, scTCR-seq and 5′ feature barcoding library preparations were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics). scRNA-seq libraries and 5′ feature barcoding libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq X (Illumina) with the following read configuration: Read 1: 28 cycles, Read 2: 96 cycles, Index read 1: 8 cycles. scTCR-seq libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq X (Illumina) with the following read configuration: Read 1: 150 cycles, Read 2: 150 cycles, Index read 1: 8 cycles.
1,000 living cells were sorted by FACS and immediately lysed in TCL buffer (QIAGEN) supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich). Full-length RNA-seq libraries were prepared following a modified SMART-Seq2 protocol ( Picelli et al., 2014 61. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, A.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (2542) PubMed Google Scholar ) as previously described ( Satija et al., 2015 68. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (3233) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cDNA concentration was measured using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and normalized to 0.25ng/ul. The cDNA libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina). Final libraries were confirmed to have a size of 500 bp using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Prior to sequencing, the uniquely barcoded libraries were pooled, normalized to 2 nM, and denatured using 0.1 N NaOH. Flow cell cluster amplification and sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols using the paired-end Illumina sequencing (38bp X 2) with 75 cycle Nextseq 500 high output V2 kit (Illumina).
6,000 viable TCRβ + CD4 + tdTomato + SLAMF6 + or CXCR6 + cells were sorted from the spleen of Il17aCre GFP X Rosa26 tdTomato mice and stored at −80°C in Bambanker™ cell freezing medium (LYMPHOTEC Inc.). For library preparation, cells were thawed at 37°C. Subsequently, cells were lysed and tagmented in 1X TD Buffer, 0.2 μL TDE1 (Illumina), 0.01% digitonin, and 0.3X PBS at 37°C for 30 min at 300 rpm, as previously described ( Corces et al., 2016 10. Corces, M.R. ∙ Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Wu, B. ... Lineage-specific and single-cell chromatin accessibility charts human hematopoiesis and leukemia evolution Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :1193-1203 Crossref Scopus (713) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA purification was performed with the MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). The complete eluate was pre-amplified with 5 PCR cycles using indexed primers with NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB) and the number of additional cycles was determined by SYBR Green quantitative PCR. After DNA purification, library quantification and quality control were performed with the Kapa Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 system with paired-end reads of 37 base pairs in length.
Paired reads were mapped to the reference mouse annotation mm10 and UMI counts were computed using CellRanger v3.0.2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 98. Zheng, G.X. ∙ Terry, J.M. ∙ Belgrader, P. ... Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14049 Crossref Scopus (3498) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters (except for chemistry = SC3Pv2 ). CellRanger filtered UMI count matrices were used for downstream analysis. Il17a GFP UMI counts were computed with a custom reference transcriptome built with the CellRanger mkref command that included the Il17a GFP transcript ( Il17a GFP and mm10 chr19). Il17a GFP UMI counts were extracted from the CellRanger raw (unfiltered) count matrices and merged with whole transcriptome count matrices described above. For the scRNA/TCR-seq experiments with cell-hashing (batches 6-9), read and UMI counts were also mapped and computed using CellRanger v3.0.2 ( chemistry = fiveprime ), then DemuxEM v0.1.5 ( Gaublomme et al., 2019 19. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Li, B. ∙ McCabe, C. ... Nuclei multiplexing with barcoded antibodies for single-nucleus genomics Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2907 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters was used to obtain tissue label assignment for every cell. Low quality cell profiles were excluded if they fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: (i) number of genes expressed ≤ 500, (ii) ≥ 5% of the total UMIs were mitochondrial RNA or (iii) < 60% of a list of house-keeping genes ( Table S6 ) were detected. We further excluded samples with less than 100 cells in non-cell-hashing batches or less than 50 cells in cell-hashing batches from further analysis (one scRNA-seq sample from PP, nine scRNA/TCR-seq sample from MLN(3), COL(2), SI(2), PP(1) and DLN(1)).
Data from different batches were integrated using the Seurat v3 SCTransform integration ( Stuart et al., 2019 79. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7323) PubMed Google Scholar ) workflow. Number of features in the SelectIntegrationFeatures function was set to infinity to allow as many variable features as possible (yielded 4,798 genes across all batches). Default parameters were used otherwise. Finally, we cleaned out non-Th17 cells and contaminations by iteratively over-cluster the cells in each tissue at each treatment condition using integrated batch-corrected expression data. Clusters that showed non-Th17 marker genes or were specific to a particular batch (the most abundant batch has significantly more cells than the second abundant batch in a cluster based on a Chi-square test (p < 0.05 and odds ratio > 2)) were excluded. Following this process, 84,124 cells (37,773 naive and 46,351 EAE) across 70 samples were used for downstream analysis.
Analyses of current Th17 cells during homeostasis ( Figure 1 ; Figure S1 ) used only non-cell-hashing (batch 1-5) data, while other analyses of transcriptomics used both types of data unless otherwise specified. Batch corrected expression levels after integration were used for visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, dot plots, violin plots, etc.) unless otherwise specified.
Seurat v3 was used to preform dimensionality reduction and clustering. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the batch corrected data with the RunPCA function. Next, a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph was constructed using a set of highest-variance PCs using the FindNeighbors function, where a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN, k.param = 20) graph was first built, the Jaccard index between every cell and its k nearest neighbors was calculated, then edges with low Jaccard index ( prune.SNN < 1/15) were removed. Clusters were constructed with the FindClusters function that maximizes the modularity of the SNN graph ( Waltman and van Eck, 2013 87. Waltman, L. ∙ van Eck, N.J. A smart local moving algorithm for large-scale modularity-based community detection Eur. Phys. J. B. 2013; 86 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (678) Google Scholar ). The number of PCs ( dims ) to be used in downstream analysis was selected using an elbow plot, and the resolution parameter ( resolution ) in FindClusters changed slightly in the different data subsets due to differences in cell number and transcriptional variation and was selected such that the clusters obtained had biologically meaningful upregulated genes. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) ( McInnes et al., 2018 55. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2018; 1802.03426 Google Scholar ) was performed using the RunUMAP function on the selected PCs and the UMAP coordinates were used for visualization. The parameters for the number of neighboring points used ( n.neighbors ), and the tightness of embedding ( min.dist ) were adjusted according to the elbow plot and the number of cells to visualize. The specific parameters used for the different analyses were as follows: dims = 1:20, resolution = 0.3, n.neighbors = 30, min.dist = 0.3 was used for GFP + naive cells inter-tissue clustering ( Figure S1 D); dims = 1:30, resolution = 0.15, n.neighbors = 30, min.dist = 0.3 was used for all naive cells intra-tissue clustering ( Figure 2 A); dims = 1:30, resolution = 0.2, n.neighbors = 30, min.dist = 0.3 was used for all EAE cells intra-tissue clustering except SPL ( Figure 3 B, Figure S6 B); dims = 1:30, resolution = 0.1, n.neighbors = 50, min.dist = 0.5 was used for all SPL EAE cells clustering ( Figure 5 A; Figure S6 B).
Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 66. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26729) PubMed Google Scholar , McCarthy et al., 2012 53. McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. Differential expression analysis of multifactor RNA-Seq experiments with respect to biological variation Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :4288-4297 Crossref Scopus (3389) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the input being raw UMI counts unless otherwise noted. Specifically, we used the quasi-likelihood method (glmQLFit and glmQLTest functions), adjusting for gene detection rate (z-normalized number of genes detected in each cell) and batch (a categorical variable with sum to zero contrasts). Genes were prefiltered such that only those detected in at least 10% of the cells in at least one of the levels in the categorical variable of interest (e.g., tissues, clusters, ex-/current Th17 status) were considered in the model, unless otherwise noted ( Soneson and Robinson, 2018 78. Soneson, C. ∙ Robinson, M.D. Bias, robustness and scalability in single-cell differential expression analysis Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :255-261 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Tissue signatures for current Th17 cells during homeostasis ( Figure 1 F) were generated by running edgeR with tissue as a categorical variable with SPL as reference, adjusting for above mentioned covariates. Batch-specific fold changes were computed for each gene based on edgeR fitted coefficients, and genes were grouped into modules if up- or downregulated in the same set of tissues. If a gene was found to be up- and downregulated (in different tissues), it was only included in the gene module where it was upregulated. Tissue signatures for all Th17 cells (current and ex-Th17) during homeostasis ( Figure S2 E) were generated in the same way, except that all genes in tissue signatures for current Th17 cells were also included in the analyses in addition to those passed the prefiltering.
Tissue-specific clusters were annotated to reflect the similarities and differences in sub-population composition across tissues ( Figure 2 B; Figure S6 C). First, cluster-specific genes were identified for each cluster within each tissue using Seurat FindAllMarkers function with default parameters. Second, an average expression profile was computed for each cluster for the union of all cluster-specific genes. Third, cosine similarities of average expression profiles were computed for each pair of clusters. Next, hierarchical clustering was conducted based on the cosine distances (1 – cosine similarities) using the Ward1 criterion ( Murtagh and Legendre, 2014 59. Murtagh, F. ∙ Legendre, P. Ward’s Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering Method: Which Algorithms Implement Ward’s Criterion? J. Classif. 2014; 31 :274-295 Crossref Scopus (2317) Google Scholar ). Each group of clusters was assigned a function-related label according to the common cluster-specific genes.
COMET ( Delaney et al., 2019 13. Delaney, C. ∙ Schnell, A. ∙ Cammarata, L.V. ... Combinatorial prediction of marker panels from single-cell transcriptomic data Mol. Syst. Biol. 2019; 15 :e9005 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) was applied to predict cell surface markers for clusters of interest. Batch corrected data were used, and the maximum number of genes in the combination (K) was set to 4. Other parameters were set to default.
Gene signature scores were computed using Seurat AddModuleScore function on integrated data with default parameters. Algorithm details were described in ( Tirosh et al., 2016 83. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Crossref Scopus (2761) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Reads were mapped and count matrices were computed in the same way as in the preprocessing of scRNA-seq data section above. Low quality cell profiles were excluded if they fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: (i) number of genes expressed ≤ 500 or ≥ 2500, (ii) ≥ 5% of the total UMIs were mitochondrial RNA or (iii) ≤ 50% of a list of house-keeping genes ( Table S6 ) were detected. Seurat v3 was then used to clean and analyze the data (default parameters were used unless otherwise specified). First, data were normalized with SCTransform function. Next, RunPCA function was applied to normalized data, followed by FindNeighbors and FindClusters function on top 30 PCs (selected according to the elbow plot) to identify 9 clusters. T reg -like, proliferating and contamination (CD74 + ) clusters were excluded to retain conventional Th17 cells (1,495 cells in total). RunPCA was applied again to the pruned dataset, and RunUMAP was applied to the top 30 PCs (selected according to the elbow plot) to obtain the UMAP coordinates for visualizations.
Three publicly available datasets, Arazi et al. ( Arazi et al., 2019 1. Arazi, A. ∙ Rao, D.A. ∙ Berthier, C.C. ..., Accelerating Medicines Partnership in SLE network The immune cell landscape in kidneys of patients with lupus nephritis Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :902-914 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ), Hemmers et al. ( Hemmers et al., 2019 24. Hemmers, S. ∙ Schizas, M. ∙ Azizi, E. ... IL-2 production by self-reactive CD4 thymocytes scales regulatory T cell generation in the thymus J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :2466-2478 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Tibbitt et al. ( Tibbitt et al., 2019 82. Tibbitt, C.A. ∙ Stark, J.M. ∙ Martens, L. ... Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of the T Helper Cell Response to House Dust Mites Defines a Distinct Gene Expression Signature in Airway Th2 Cells Immunity. 2019; 51 :169-184 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ), were analyzed to validate if Cd274 is a possible marker gene for the ISG-high cells discovered in each of these studies. Standard Seurat clustering workflow was applied to each dataset to identify the ISG-high cells, and the odds ratio of Cd274 detection (non-zero reads) comparing the ISG-high cells versus other CD4 + cells in the data was computed.
Public human scRNA-seq data for PBMC and CSF immune cells from healthy controls and MS patients were obtained from Schafflick et al. ( Schafflick et al., 2020 70. Schafflick, D. ∙ Xu, C.A. ∙ Hartlehnert, M. ... Integrated single cell analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes in multiple sclerosis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :247 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). PBMC and CSF data were preprocessed, normalized, integrated, and clustered respectively using the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline described above. Signature scores were computed with the AddModuleScore function in Seurat.
scRNA-seq data for mouse CNS immune cells were obtained from Wheeler et al. ( Wheeler et al., 2020 89. Wheeler, M.A. ∙ Clark, I.C. ∙ Tjon, E.C. ... MAFG-driven astrocytes promote CNS inflammation Nature. 2020; 578 :593-599 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data from each sample were cleaned up by excluding cells where ≤ 400 genes were detected or ≥ 5% of total UMIs were mitochondrial RNA, then processed by NormalizeData and FindVariableFeatures functions in Seurat v3. Samples were then integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions. Only samples from the priming EAE stage (n = 6) were used to compute the proportion of cells with positive UMI counts. Cell type labels were provided by Wheeler et al.
Paired reads were mapped to GRCm38 V(D)J sequences (build from Ensembl Mus_musculus.GRCm38.90.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.gtf ) and UMI counts were computed using CellRanger v3.0.2 with default parameters. Alpha and beta chains were filtered to keep only those that were from a detected cell, had high confidence and labeled as productive, as determined by CellRanger. Cell quality control was done based on the number of dominant alpha and beta chains. For each cell, 0, 1 or 2 dominant chains were identified for each of alpha and beta chains respectively. If only one chain was detected that chain was called dominant. If two chains were detected, call the more abundant (both if equal UMI counts) chain as dominant. If three or more chains were detected, the most abundant chain was determined dominant if it constituted more than 2 times the UMI counts than the second most abundant chain. Only cells with at least one dominant alpha (unless no valid alpha chain was detected in the first place) and at least one dominant beta chain were retained. Clonotypes were defined as sets of cells that have the same dominant alpha (if any) and dominant beta chain nucleotide sequences.
TCR repertoire similarity score (TRSS) reflects the similarity in clonal distribution across two sets of cells (e.g., two different clusters or tissue) and was measured with the Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC, Formula 1 ) 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑖 , 𝑗 = ∑ 𝐶 𝑘 = 1 √ 𝑝 𝑖 𝑘 ⋅ 𝑝 𝑗 𝑘 (1) where 𝑝 𝑖 𝑘 and 𝑝 𝑗 𝑘 are the proportions of cells in group 𝑖 and 𝑗 that belongs to clonotype 𝑘 , with a total of 𝐶 clonotypes. This coefficient is between 0 and 1, and larger value indicates higher similarity in clonotype distributions. To increase power, cells from different mice were pooled for analyses unless otherwise noted. To identify cases of high TCR repertoire similarity, hierarchical clustering was performed on the Bhattacharyya distance ( Formula 2 ) using the Ward2 criterion ( Murtagh and Legendre, 2014 59. Murtagh, F. ∙ Legendre, P. Ward’s Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering Method: Which Algorithms Implement Ward’s Criterion? J. Classif. 2014; 31 :274-295 Crossref Scopus (2317) Google Scholar ). Distances that are infinitely large (when BC = 0) were capped at 10 times the maximum finite value in the distance matrix. 𝐷 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) = − l n ⁡ ( 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) (2)
To score clonal expansion we used the clonal expansion score previously proposed and used in STARTRAC ( Zhang et al., 2018 96. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). The clonal expansion score depicts the diversity of clone sizes, defined as the complement of normalized Shannon entropy ( Formula 3 ), where 𝑝 𝑘 is the proportion of cells that belong to clonotype 𝑘 , with a total of 𝐶 clonotypes. The score ranges from 0 to 1. A score of 0 means all clones have equal sizes hence no interesting differences, whereas a score of 1 means there is only one expanded clonotype. Therefore, a large value between 0 and 1 indicates the existence of highly expanded clonotypes given the presence of non-expanded ones. 1 − − ∑ 𝐶 𝑘 = 1 𝑝 𝑘 ⁢ l o g 2 ⁡ 𝑝 𝑘 l o g 2 ⁡ 𝐶 (3)
GLIPH2 ( Huang et al., 2020 28. Huang, H. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Rubelt, F. ... Analyzing the Mycobacterium tuberculosis immune response by T-cell receptor clustering with GLIPH2 and genome-wide antigen screening Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1194-1202 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ) was applied to all homeostasis cells with valid TCR information to identify clusters of TCRs that recognizes the same epitope based on CDR3β amino acid sequence similarities. GLIPH2 identified a total of 1,881 TCR specificity groups based on global CDR3β similarity. Among these, 552 groups had Fisher score < 0.05, which are more likely induced by exposing to specific antigens than by chance. Specifically, GLIPH2 only allow one CDR3β sequence per cell, we split cells with 2 valid beta chains in two cells and collapsed the GLIPH2 clusters if they contain chains extracted from the same cell, resulting in 545 groups. Note that in Figure S6 A, we further restricted to cells with a valid tissue label according in the demultiplexing step (see: Preprocessing of scRNA-seq data section above) and retained 322 groups.
Paired reads were mapped to mouse annotation mm10 using HISAT2 ( Kim et al., 2019 34. Kim, D. ∙ Paggi, J.M. ∙ Park, C. ... Graph-based genome alignment and genotyping with HISAT2 and HISAT-genotype Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :907-915 Crossref Scopus (5837) PubMed Google Scholar ), and sequencing depth normalized TPM values were computed using RSEM ( Li and Dewey, 2011 50. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13975) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. If a sample was sequenced in multiple lanes, normalized TPM values were summed up across these lanes to obtain sample-level data. Samples with low total number of reads, low alignment rate or low uniquely alignment rate compared to the rest of samples were excluded. Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR on TPMs with default parameters. Specifically, we used the generalized log-linear model and the likelihood ratio test (glmFit and glmLRT).
A publicly available pipeline for ATAC-seq data analyses ( Lee et al., 2016 49. Lee, J., Christoforo G., Christoforo G., Foo C.S., Probert V., Kundaje A., Boley N., kohpangwei, Dacre M., & Kim D., 2016. kundajelab/atac_dnase_pipelines: 0.3.3 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.211733 . Google Scholar ) was used to perform read alignment, filtering and quality control. Reads were aligned to reference mouse annotation mm10 using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 44. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33794) PubMed Google Scholar ), and filtered for duplicated and mitochondrial reads. Peak-calling was performed using MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 95. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (10894) PubMed Google Scholar ). Read counts per peak were computed using bedtools multicov tool, then analyzed for differential peak accessibility using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 52. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48472) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCA was applied to the top 50,000 highly variable accessible regions to examine the difference between SLAM6 + and CXCR6 + populations ( Figure 5 I). Peaks were associated to nearby genes based on cis-regulatory elements using Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) ( McLean et al., 2010 56. McLean, C.Y. ∙ Bristor, D. ∙ Hiller, M. ... GREAT improves functional interpretation of cis-regulatory regions Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :495-501 Crossref Scopus (2963) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the basal plus extension association rule and default parameters. If a gene is associated with more than one peak, it was assigned with the peak that has more significant differential peak accessibility (lower FDR). The ATAC signature score was computed as the average of log-normalized counts of the peaks associated with genes in the signature.
Gene set enrichment scores and p values were computed with fGSEA ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 41. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; Published online June 20, 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ), a fast algorithm for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). For scRNA-seq data, genes were ranked according to the transformed F-test statistic in decreasing order, where the F values were obtained from the glmQLTest function in edgeR differential expression analysis, and the F values with a corresponding negative log-fold change were multiplied by (−1). For bulk RNA-seq data, genes were ranked according to the transformed likelihood ratio (LR) statistic in decreasing order, where the LR values were obtained from glmLRTest function in edgeR differential expression analysis and transformed in the same way as for scRNA-seq data.
Proportions in Figures 2 G, S3 I, 7 A, 7 C, and 7 D were computed for each sample respectively (each batch of batch 1-5 or each mouse in batch 6-9 was considered as one sample). A generalized linear mixed effects model with logistic link was fitted to test for a difference between the two groups, where a random intercept was used to model the variability across samples and a fixed slope for the group difference. P values < 0.05 are considered significant (NS, not significant; ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001).
Spearman or Spearman correlations of scores were computed for pairs of signatures in Figures S5 A–S5C. t tests (cor.test function in the R stats package v3.6.2) were performed to assess if the correlations were significantly different from 0. P values < 0.05 are considered significant (NS, not significant; ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001).
Two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess the differences in Figures S4 B , S6 H , S7 C, and S7J. P values < 0.05 are considered significant (NS, not significant; ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001).
Statistical analysis of non-sequencing data was performed with the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad). Unless otherwise specified, data are presented as the mean with ± SEM and statistical significance was determined using unpaired two-tailed t test. P values < 0.05 are considered significant (NS, not significant; ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ , p < 0.0001). For the analysis of EAE disease curves, linear regression was performed for each condition followed by testing for the slopes to be significantly different.
