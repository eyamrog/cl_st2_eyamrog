Title: Mouse oocytes develop in cysts with the help of nurse cells


Abstract: Summary

Mouse germline cysts, on average, develop into six oocytes supported by 24 nurse cells that transfer cytoplasm and organelles to generate a Balbiani body. We showed that between E14.5 and P5, cysts periodically activate some nurse cells to begin cytoplasmic transfer, which causes them to shrink and turnover within 2 days. Nurse cells die by a programmed cell death (PCD) pathway involving acidification, similar to Drosophila nurse cells, and only infrequently by apoptosis. Prior to initiating transfer, nurse cells co-cluster by scRNA-seq with their pro-oocyte sisters, but during their final 2 days, they cluster separately. The genes promoting oocyte development and nurse cell PCD are upregulated, whereas the genes that repress transfer, such as Tex14, and oocyte factors, such as Nobox and Lhx8, are under-expressed. The transferred nurse cell centrosomes build a cytocentrum that establishes a large microtubule aster in the primordial oocyte that organizes the Balbiani body, defining the earliest oocyte polarity.

Section: Introduction

Mouse female germ cells begin developing immediately after reaching the embryonic ovary, rapidly undergo key meiotic events, and form into ovarian follicles by just 5 days after birth ( Edson et al., 2009 7.

Most of prefollicular development takes place in germ cell groups known as cysts, structures that initiate both male and female gametogenesis prior to meiosis in diverse animals ( King, 1970 26.

Structure and functions of stable intercellular bridges formed by incomplete cytokinesis during development Commun. Integr. Biol. 2011; 4 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single primordial germ cell lineage-labeling experiments revealed the general characteristics of mouse female cysts, which start with an average of 30 cells interconnected by intercellular bridges (also known as ring canals) when division ceases at embryonic day E14.5 ( Lei and Spradling, 2013 30. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse primordial germ cells produce cysts that partially fragment prior to meiosis Development. 2013; 140 :2075-2081 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Over the next 10 days, the 24–25 nonoocyte cyst germ cells are sequentially activated for turnover, until by P5 only 6 single primordial oocytes remain ( Pepling et al., 2007 46. Pepling, M.E. ∙ Wilhelm, J.E. ∙ O’Hara, A.L. ... Mouse oocytes within germ cell cysts and primordial follicles contain a Balbiani body Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :187-192 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lei and Spradling, 2013 30. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse primordial germ cells produce cysts that partially fragment prior to meiosis Development. 2013; 140 :2075-2081 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Figure 1 A shows a model consistent with observed cyst parameters. The initial cyst of 30 cells quickly fragments on average into six smaller cysts of about five cells, suggesting that each oocyte develops from a cyst containing four nonoocytes ( Figure 1 B). However, many features of primordial oocyte production, including the exact starting structures of initial cysts, their fragmentation pattern, how pro-oocytes and nonoocytes are selected, how the genetic activity of these two cell types differs, and the ultimate function of cyst-based oocyte production remain imperfectly understood.
Previously, most mouse cyst cells that do not become oocytes were shown to be "nurse cells" since they transfer their cytoplasm and organelles in a nonsynchronized manner into the pro-oocytes, although their nuclei are excluded ( Lei and Spradling, 2016 31. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse oocytes differentiate through organelle enrichment from sister cyst germ cells Science. 2016; 352 :95-99 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ; see Figure 1 B). As predicted, if nearly all nonoocyte cyst cells are nurse cells, oocytes by P5 contained about 5 times as many centrosomes, Golgi material, and mitochondria and about 4 times as much cytoplasmic volume as E14.5 germ cells ( Lei and Spradling, 2016 31. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse oocytes differentiate through organelle enrichment from sister cyst germ cells Science. 2016; 352 :95-99 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nurse cell transfer correlates with the appearance only in the oocyte cytoplasm of a Balbiani body, a juxtanuclear aggregate of organelles that has been reported in newly formed follicles of many vertebrates and invertebrates ( Hertig and Adams, 1967 20. Hertig, A.T. ∙ Adams, E.C. Studies on the human oocyte and its follicle. I. Ultrastructural and histochemical observations on the primordial follicle stage J.

Initially, genetic studies of mice lacking the intercellular bridge (IB) protein Tex14 found that females lacked normal IBs but remain fertile (although less fecund), suggesting that cysts are not essential for oocyte production ( Greenbaum et al., 2006 13. Greenbaum, M.P. ∙ Yan, W. ∙ Wu, M.H. ... TEX14 is essential for intercellular bridges and fertility in male mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :4982-4987 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar , 2009 11. Greenbaum, M.P. ∙ Iwamori, N. ∙ Agno, J.E. ... Mouse TEX14 is required for embryonic germ cell intercellular bridges but not female fertility Biol. Reprod. 2009; 80 :449-457 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). More detailed studies confirmed that Tex14 mutation disrupts normal IB formation but found that some female cysts form and polarize. Their cyst cells compensate for the defective bridges and transfer organelles from nurse cells to oocytes through broken membranes on an accelerated schedule, suggesting that Tex14 is a transfer inhibitor ( Ikami et al., 2021 23. Ikami, K. ∙ Nuzhat, N. ∙ Abbott, H. ... Altered germline cyst formation and oogenesis in Tex14 mutant mice Biol. Open. 2021; 10 :bio058807 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cysts play two roles in Drosophila and other animals, where cyst function has been extensively investigated using developmental genetic and comparative studies ( Spradling, 1993 52. Spradling, A.

First, cyst production establishes an asymmetric microtubule cytoskeletal polarity based on its formative divisions ( Koch and King, 1966 27. Koch, E.A. ∙ King, R.C.

This polarity underlies specification of distinct nurse cell and oocyte fates and blueprints the earliest polarity of the oocyte itself. Beginning around pachytene and continuing over several days, centrioles, mitochondria, Golgi, ER, cytoplasm, and specific mRNAs move through the cyst's nurse cells until they reach the oocyte ( Mahowald and Strassheim, 1970 36.

Centrosome migration into the Drosophila oocyte is independent of BicD and egl, and of the organisation of the microtubule cytoskeleton Development. 2001; 128 :1889-1897 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). As a follicle forms, organelles enter the oocyte en masse and generate a Balbiani body, whose centrioles and some mRNAs relocate to the cortex opposite the entry site to define the oocyte posterior ( Mahowald and Strassheim, 1970 36. Mahowald, A.P. ∙ Strassheim, J.M. Intercellular migration of centrioles in the germarium of Drosophila melanogaster. An electron microscopic study J.

Near the end of oogenesis, cyst nurse cells dump their remaining cytoplasmic contents into the oocyte and undergo a distinctive pathway of programmed cell death (PCD) ( Mondragon et al., 2019 39.

Section: Results

Previous studies of mouse cyst development ( Lei and Spradling, 2016 31. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse oocytes differentiate through organelle enrichment from sister cyst germ cells Science. 2016; 352 :95-99 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ) reported the presence within cysts of small germ cells containing few organelles ( Figure 1 B) but did not investigate them quantitatively. We considered that such small, organelle-poor cells likely arise as a result of ongoing nurse cell cytoplasmic transfer and that analyzing small germ cells might be useful in gaining greater insight into cyst breakdown. Consequently, we systematically studied germ cell clones lineage-labeled with YFP at E10.5 and analyzed at five subsequent developmental times. We measured the size of 134 cysts and counted how many small germ cells are recognizable by microscopy each contained ( Figures 1 C–1E, and S1 F). The average clone size at each time point ( Figure 1 D) is shown in Figure 1 F line 1. The difference between the average clone size every 2 days ( Figure 1 D) represents the number of germ cells that turn over during the next 2 days in the cohort of cysts derived from single E10.5 progenitors ( Figure 1 F; line 2). The number of small cells per cohort is shown in Figure 1 F line 3, and nearly, all of these cells had reduced levels of Golgi and/or mitochondria ( Figure S1 A). This demonstrates that nurse cell turnover involves a terminal stage about 2 days in length during part of which cells become depleted of organelles and cytoplasm. In total, 61%–84% of these nurse cells that turn over during any given 2-day interval can be recognized microscopically as small cells, suggesting that shrinking nurse cells become recognizably small during much of this period.
We also scored the volume of these cysts and quantitated the Golgi and mitochondrial marker levels ( Figures S1 A–S1D). We measured the small size of the remnant cells compared with oocytes ( Figure S1 B) and validated by marker staining that mitochondrial and Golgi material per cell increases about 5-fold between E14.5 and P5 ( Figures S1 C and S1D). This increase is close to the ratio of nurse cells to oocytes in E14.5 cysts (30.5/6 = 5.1) and further supports previous studies that most or all nonoocyte cells in mouse cysts are nurse cells.
Finally, to further validate that the small cells seen in cysts are nurse cells, we immunostained ovaries throughout cyst development with markers for five well-known genes that are functionally important for oocyte development—Nobox, Lhx8, Nlrp5, Filia, and Tle6 ( Figure 1 G). Nobox expression was specific for the pro-oocyte (indicted by the large accumulation of mitochondria), even at E18.5. Labeling was not observed or was extremely weak in both smaller and full-sized nurse cells present in the cyst. The same high level of specificity was observed for the other genes at P0 or P1. Full-time series at six points spanning cyst development are shown in Figures S1 G–S1I for Nobox, NLRP5, and Filia. Taken together with previous studies, these experiments show that the great majority if not all cyst cells that fail to become oocytes serve as nurse cells and that nurse cells become smaller in size and differentially express genes relative to pro-oocytes during a majority of their last 2 days before turnover.
The turnover of mammalian germ cells during fetal and perinatal development has historically been described as apoptosis, but multiple pathways were identified more recently (reviewed in Tilly, 2001 57. Tilly, J.L. Commuting the death sentence: how oocytes strive to survive Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2 :838-848 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ; Grive, 2020 15. Grive, K.J. Pathways coordinating oocyte attrition and abundanceduring mammalian ovarian reserve establishment Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2020; 87 :843-856 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, nurse cells were recently shown to undergo a novel type of PCD in the Drosophila ovary that is dependent on adjacent somatic cells ( Mondragon et al., 2019 39. Mondragon, A.A. ∙ Yalonetskaya, A. ∙ Ortega, A.J. ... Lysosomal machinery drives extracellular acidification to direct non-apoptotic cell death Cell Rep. 2019; 27 :11-19.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; reviewed in Lebo and McCall, 2021 29. Lebo, D.P.V. ∙ McCall, K. Murder on the ovarian express: a tale of non-autonomous cell death in the Drosophila ovary Cells. 2021; 10 :1454-1473 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). A major indicator of this PCD pathway is nurse cell acidification that is driven by fusion with acidic vesicles generated within surrounding somatic follicle cells ( Figure 2 A). Subsequently, the follicle cells express and transfer to the nurse cells cathepsins and DNAases that digest the nurse cells. In contrast, apoptotic cell death ( Figure 2 B) can be detected using antibodies to cleaved caspase3, a downstream effector caspase. Moreover, in apoptotic cell death, but not in PCD, nuclear lamin B1 protein is degraded. Consequently, we set out to characterize mouse germ cell turn over using these markers of the two pathways.
Germline cysts in perinatal mouse ovaries break down normally in culture, which allowed us to observe the process after 12 h of culture in the presence of the acidophilic dye Lysotracker. Many germ cells whose small nuclei identified them as nurse cells became Lysotracker positive from E16.5- P1 ( Figure 2 C). The small nurse cells undergoing acidification are surrounded by Lgr5-positive cells, a marker for pregranulosa cells ( Figure 2 D). In Drosophila , somatic cell V-ATPases generate a pH gradient across the somatic cell membrane in the nurse cell. Exocytosis machinery then transfers acid vesicles and cathepsins (acid-activatable proteases) to drive acidification and proteolysis nonautonomously. The pregranulosa cells surrounding acidified mouse germ cells contained acidic cytoplasmic vesicles ( Figure 2 E). Multiple mouse V-ATPases as well as multiple cathepsins are highly expressed in these pregranulosa cells based on previous scRNA-seq analyses ( Niu and Spradling, 2020 42. Niu, W. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Two distinct pathways of pregranulosa cell differentiation support follicle formation in the mouse ovary Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :20015-20026 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S2 A and S2B). The most highly expressed cathepsin in mouse pregranulosa cells, Ctsl, is the ortholog of the Drosophila cathepsin Cp1 that is genetically required for nurse cell turnover ( Mondragon et al., 2019 39. Mondragon, A.A. ∙ Yalonetskaya, A. ∙ Ortega, A.J. ... Lysosomal machinery drives extracellular acidification to direct non-apoptotic cell death Cell Rep. 2019; 27 :11-19.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas expression of the second most highly expressed cathepsin (Ctsb) is elevated in pregranulosa cells surrounding remnant nurse cells ( Figure 2 F). This expression, like nurse cell turnover, is gone by P4 ( Figure S2 C).
To investigate if acidification is required for mouse nurse cell turn over, we cultured ovaries in vitro starting at E17.5 either in the presence or absence of the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). Without the inhibitor, oocyte maturation into primordial follicles is largely complete after 6 days in culture as indicated by the presence of GM130-positive Balbiani bodies (Bb) ( Figure 2 G, arrow). In contrast, in the BafA1-treated cultures, Lysotracker vesicles are no longer seen in somatic cells ( Figure S2 D), and many nurse cell nuclear remnants persist ( Figure 2 G, arrowheads). Quantitating this effect showed that disruption of V-ATPase function with BafA1 strongly inhibited nurse cell PCD and generated a massive increase in undigested nurse cell nuclear remnants ( Figure 2 H).
We compared the relative frequency of germ cell PCD and apoptosis from E14.5 with P5 using Lysotracker to mark PCD and TUNEL positivity or cleaved caspase 3 to indicate apoptosis. Many more cells were stained with Lysotracker, than with either apoptosis marker ( Figure 2 I). Between 2 and 6 times, as many germ cells ( Figure 2 J) were observed turning over using PCD than apoptosis, indicating that as in Drosophila , mouse nurse cells mostly turn over by PCD. This conclusion was further supported by staining ovarian tissue for lamin B1 ( Figure 2 K) and observing that the lamin B1-rich subnuclear layer was degraded in very few dying nurse cells ( Figure 2 L). Turnover by apoptosis may be used by a separate small subclass of germ cells, such as those that have experienced developmental arrest, rather than normally developing cyst cells. Overall, these experiments illustrate striking similarities in nurse cell turnover in mouse and Drosophila ( Figure S2 E).
Having measured the fraction of nurse cells turning over at 2-day intervals and shown that most eventually shrink in size ( Figure 1 F), we investigated whether these cells can be recognized by scRNA-seq. We used data from a large scRNA-seq analysis of mouse ovaries comprising seven time points beginning with cyst formation (E11.5, E12.5) and following at 2-day intervals (E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, and P1) spanning nurse cell dumping and turnover until the completion of cyst breakdown and primordial follicle formation by P5 ( Niu and Spradling, 2020 42. Niu, W. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Two distinct pathways of pregranulosa cell differentiation support follicle formation in the mouse ovary Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :20015-20026 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Using Seurat 2, we reclustered nearly 1,800 germ cells, identifying 22 separate groups ( Figure 3 A; Table S1 ). Fifteen clusters comprising 74.5% of total cells had moderate to high levels of UMI/cell ( Figure 3 B, above dashed line), a measure of mRNA content, and localized on an outer ring of the tSNE plot ( Figure 3 A, outer arrows). The individual clusters in the outer ring recapitulate developmental time and meiotic stage, which increased uniformly in a clockwise direction ( Figure S3 ). Clusters starting with “0” are mitotic cystocytes found mostly at E12.5, “1” are leptotene or zygotene cells found mostly at E14.5, “2” are pachytene cells found mostly at E16.5, “3” are diplotene cells found mostly at E18.5, and “4” are dictyate cells found mostly at P1 (4a) or P5 (4b). Substages indicted by “a,” “b,” etc. represent finer subdivisions of the corresponding meiotic stages. This information is also shown in the form of labeled arrows on Figure 3 A. These outer ring clusters contain pro-oocytes based on meiotic gene expression, but they must also include many nurse cells with similar expression because pro-oocytes only make up 20% of germ cells at this time (6 pro-oocytes per 30.5 starting cyst cells/clone), suggesting that 54.5% of main sequence cells at E14.5 are young nurse cells that still express the same genes as their pro-oocyte sisters.
Six of the remaining seven clusters (1N, 1Nr, 2Nr, 3N, 4N, and 4Nr) contain 22.1% of cells and likely comprise nurse cells at each developmental stage that have recently changed their gene expression enough to diverge from the main ring. This change in gene expression likely occurs when cyst nurse cells are “activated” by a local signal within their cyst to begin transferring their cytoplasm about 2 days before they turn over. Four observations strongly support this conclusion: (1) The stage-specific nurse cell clusters are mostly located very close on the tSNE plot to the main sequence clusters from the same developmental age, consistent with the fairly small genetic divergence expected after a recent change in gene expression. (2) There is a very close correspondence between the normalized number of activated nurse cells at each time point ( Figure 3 E, “nurse cell, activated”) and the normalized number of cells that will turn over in the next 2 days ( Figure 1 F; line 2). For example, at E14.5, the values are 6 versus 5.7 cells, at E16.5- 6.2 versus 7.0 cells, at E18.5- 4.8 versus 7.1 cells, and at P1- 4.5 versus 4.7 cells. (3) The turnover of these cells in little more than 2 days is independently validated because each nurse cell cluster was found at mainly one time point ( Table S1 ). Thus, at E14.5, 128 cells are found in the 1N and 1Nr clusters, but only 1 cell is found in these cluster at E16.5, and none thereafter. At E16.5, 70 cells are found in cluster 2Nr, but only 3 cells are found at E18.5, and 1 at P1, etc. (4) Finally, these clusters contain almost all the small cells based on low UMI/cell, and small cells were microscopically observed to consist of nurse cells in various stages of organelle and cytoplasmic transfer ( Figures 1 B, 1G, S1 A, and S1B) and programmed cell death ( Figure 2 ).
Cluster 5 cells (3.3% of germ cells) were found at low frequency at all time points and might represent apoptotic cells. Cluster 5 cells displayed low UMI, but enrichment of apoptotic genes was not observed. They are included in Figures 3 E and 3F as potential "apoptotic cells."
These findings allow us to estimate the fraction of oocytes versus nurse cells present in fetal and perinatal germ cells throughout cyst development ( Figures 3 E and 3F). For example, at E14.5, we know that the percentage of oocytes is 6/30.5 or 20%. Activated nurse cells make up another 6 (20%) and cluster 5 cells comprise 4% (28/688 E14.5 cells, Table S1 ). That implicates the remaining 56% of cells as nurse cells that reside in the main ring clusters. These nurse cells have not yet become "activated" to alter their gene expression, to open membrane gaps, and to begin transferring cytoplasm and organelles within the cyst. Figure 3 F displays in graphic form the relative number of nurse cells and oocytes in mouse fetal and perinatal germ cells. Finally, Figure 3 G models the behavior of a single PGC-derived clone of germ cells that matches the average cyst parameters in our experiments and with the different types of cells indicated by color.
Since all the cells in a female germline cyst derive from a common progenitor and since virtually all enter meiosis together by E14.5, it is not surprising that the main sequence clusters that comprise pro-oocytes and unactivated nurse cells express well-characterized meiotic-stage-enriched transcripts ( Figure 4 A, left columns). Interestingly, even nurse cells that have begun to transfer cytoplasm ( Figure 4 A, right columns) largely follow the meiotic expression, more weakly, of normal germ cells of the same age ( Figure 4 A, left columns). This is not surprising, given that these cells became activated to diverge from the main sequence expression program less than 2 days earlier, providing little time to accumulate a drastically different transcriptome. We confirmed these conclusions by comparing upregulated and downregulated genes generally during corresponding time points of the indicated main sequence clusters ( Figures 4 B–4D) with upregulated and downregulated genes in activated nurse cells from the same developmental stages ( Figures 4 B′–4D'). The highly expressed genes changing in either direction are the largely same in normal meiotic cells and in transferring nurse cells.
We searched for changes in less abundant genes potentially downstream from a transfer signal and responsible for the divergence of nurse cells on the tSNE plot using Metascape gene enrichment analysis ( Zhou et al., 2019 63. Zhou, Y. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Pache, L. ... Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1523 Crossref Scopus (7477) PubMed Google Scholar ). When we analyzed genes upregulated 1.5× or more in E14.5 cluster 1Nr nurse cells relative with their average expression in main sequence E14.5 germ cells, we observed several potentially significant GO categories that were enriched with an false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 ( Figure 4 E). The highest enrichment was GO:0001890 placenta development. This was particularly interesting, given that both nurse cells and placental cells provide support during early oogenesis or fetal development, respectively, to other developing cells and suggests that some upregulated nurse cell genes aid the oocyte. The second highest enrichment was GO:0010942-positive regulation of cell death, which included GO:0043068-positive regulation of PCD and GO:0043065-positive regulation of apoptosis. Considering that 1Nr nurse cells are likely to undergo cell turnover within 2 days or less, some upregulated nurse cell genes likely promote their own turnover. Similar searches for genes enriched in E16.5 and E18.5 nurse cells ( Figure 4 E) yielded evidence of gene expression changes relevant to cell migration and microtubule cytoskeletal organization. At E18.5 and P1, downregulated GO categories were also observed with high FDR scores involving chromatin organization, suggesting that the transfer signal may modulate pro-oocyte nuclear development during later cyst stages.
We further investigated genes downregulated in nurse cells compared with closely related main sequence germ cells ( Figure S4 ). We validated that the oocyte genes studied in Figure 1 G are downregulated in nurse cells at the level of nurse cell gene expression by scRNA-seq ( Figure S4 A). Expression of these genes in nurse cells was 22%–40% of that in main stream germ cells. This differential appeared smaller than the difference we observed previously at the protein level, suggesting that translational regulation contributes to the oocyte specific expression.
Additional genes downregulated in nurse cells were also identified ( Figure S4 B). One of the most interesting was Tex14. Downregulation of Tex14 expression as nurse cells become activated might serve to derepress and activate cytoplasmic transfer. Thus, genetic changes in nurse cells following activation serve to support nurse cell function, including cytoplasmic transfer, as well as promote oocyte differentiation.

Liang, L.F. ∙ Soyal, S.M. ∙ Dean, J.

FIGLA, LHX8 and SOHLH1 transcription factor networks regulate mouse oocyte growth and differentiation Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :3525-3541 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified nearly 200 genes that are upregulated in dictyate oocytes, including many target genes in this cascade ( Figure S6 ; Table S3 ). Only 13% of these genes were expressed in P1 nurse cells at even 50% of their level in oocytes, whereas a majority were expressed at less than 10% of oocyte levels. This is the same range of differential RNA expression we observed for the genes analyzed in Figure 1 G ( Figure S4 A) and suggests that the expression of many additional oocyte genes are repressed in nurse cells.
The strong similarity in gene expression between meiotic germ cells and nurse cells suggested that nurse cells initially develop as normal meiotic cells, but at varying times, during meiosis, receive a signal initiating cytoplasm and organelle transport. One possible signal source are the somatic cells that surround developing cyst cells ( Figure 5 I). To investigate the role of epithelial pregranulosa (EPG) cells associated with developing cortical follicles, we ablated EPGs as described previously using Lgr5-DTR-EGFP mice and diphtheria toxin injection at E14.5 ( Figure S5 A; see also Niu and Spradling, 2020 42. Niu, W. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Two distinct pathways of pregranulosa cell differentiation support follicle formation in the mouse ovary Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :20015-20026 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Ablation was highly effective, as the number of Lgr5+ cells, which normally surround developing germ cells was greatly reduced ( Figures 5 A and S5 B). Germ cells continued to develop, although their numbers decreased after E18.5 ( Figure S5 C). Golgi elements decreased in P1 and P4 germ cells ( Figures 5 B and 5C) and did not cluster into a Balbiani body. Not only Golgi/per cell ( Figures 5 D and S5 D) but mitochondria/per cell ( Figures 5 E and S5 E) and Pericentrin (centrosomes)/per cell ( Figures 5 F and S5 F) decreased. Thus, germ cells lacking interactions with EPGs did not undergo the normal, large increase in organelle numbers associated with nurse cell transfer after E18.5 and did not form Balbiani bodies.
Another well-established contributor to oocyte development in invertebrates is the cyst cytoskeleton ( Figure 5 I). We labeled cyst microtubules with an antialpha-tubulin antibody and observed synchronous cyst mitoses up to E14.5 ( Figure 5 G, left). Cysts that had completed mitotic divisions retained abundant cytoplasmic microtubules ( Figure 5 G, middle). Cysts at E15.5 displayed a microtubule cytoskeleton whose density varied within different cyst regions and that associated with centrosomes in the process of transport ( Figure 5 G, right). Organelle transport along a polarized microtubule cytoskeleton may explain why treatment of cultured ovaries with low levels of antimicrotubule drugs impairs the formation of primordial oocytes and Balbiani bodies ( Koch and Spitzer, 1983 28. Koch, E.A. ∙ Spitzer, R.H. Multiple effects of colchicine on oogenesis in Drosophila: induced sterility and switch of potential oocyte to nurse-cell developmental pathway Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 228 :21-32 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lei and Spradling, 2016 31. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse oocytes differentiate through organelle enrichment from sister cyst germ cells Science. 2016; 352 :95-99 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The actin cytoskeleton plays critical roles during Drosophila cyst development. Bundled actin fibers form in stage 10A that attach to nurse cell nuclei just before bulk cytoplasmic transfer at stage 10B. If these fibers are disrupted by a mutation in profilin or a variety of actin bundling proteins, nuclei move toward the oocyte and block transfer (reviewed in Hudson and Cooley, 2002 21. Hudson, A.M. ∙ Cooley, L. Understanding the function of actin-binding proteins through genetic analysis of Drosophila oogenesis Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36 :455-488 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). We looked for the presence of actin fibers in mouse cysts before and during transfer. Strong focal accumulations of actin were observed surrounding nurse cell remnant nuclei in cells that were transferring cytoplasm ( Figures 5 H and S5 G). This suggests that actin fibers tether mouse nurse cell nuclei and prevent their entry into the oocyte.
One of the earliest events of primordial oocyte development is Balbiani body (Bb) production ( Figure 6 A). The Bb in humans contains a large central region known as the cytocentrum that is thought to be a centrosome-like structure ( Hertig and Adams, 1967 20. Hertig, A.T. ∙ Adams, E.C. Studies on the human oocyte and its follicle. I. Ultrastructural and histochemical observations on the primordial follicle stage J. Cell Biol. 1967; 34 :647-675 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a similar region is seen in the mouse Bb ( Pepling et al., 2007 46. Pepling, M.E. ∙ Wilhelm, J.E. ∙ O’Hara, A.L. ... Mouse oocytes within germ cell cysts and primordial follicles contain a Balbiani body Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :187-192 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). The migration and accumulation of multiple centrosomes in the oocyte perinuclear region occurs concomitantly with Bb formation and were proposed to help generate this structure ( Lei and Spradling, 2016 31. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse oocytes differentiate through organelle enrichment from sister cyst germ cells Science. 2016; 352 :95-99 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further studied the migration of centrosomes, often with an associated Golgi element, and confirmed that they accumulate initially as separate structures in E18.5 to P1 oocytes ( Figure 6 B). Subsequently, the dispersed centrosome/Golgi pairs assemble into a larger structure by P5 ( Figure 6 B). The dispersed centrosomes ( Figure 6 C, left) interact with each other, aggregate, and fuse into a large cytocentrum, which then nucleates microtubules and organizes oocyte organelles into a Bb ( Figure 6 C, right). Staining for alpha-Tubulin revealed that the consolidated centrosomes nucleate a very large microtubule aster in primordial oocytes that is many times larger than the aster typically seen associated with the single centrosome of younger female germ cells ( Figure 6 D).
In order to identify genes involved in cytocentrum formation, we investigated the role of two tubulin genes, Tuba1c and Tubb2b, that our data showed turn on selectively in oocytes beginning in P1 ( Figure 6 E). In mice whose germlines lack Tuba1c, the final assembly of the Golgi elements in the P1 oocyte into a mature Balbiani body by P4 did not take place ( Figure 6 F) in about 40% of oocytes ( Figure 6 H). This same defect became even more frequent (55%) in the double mutant of Tuba1c and Tubb2b ( Figures 6 G and 6H). Thus, Tuba1c and Tubb2b represent genes that contribute to cytocentrum consolidation and Balbiani body formation.

Section: Discussion

These studies provide a much clearer picture at both the cellular and molecular levels of how oocytes develop in germline cysts. Unactivated nurse cells strongly resemble pro-oocytes and follow a very similar program of gene expression. However, once an individual nurse cell receives a local signal from within its cyst, its gene expression changes quickly, and it embarks on a program of organelle and cytoplasmic transfer that shrinks its size and primes it to turn over by a special PCD pathway involving acidification mediated by surrounding pregranulosa cells.
Activated E14.5 nurse cells upregulate genes that likely promote the oocyte's development, as suggested by their association with the GO term "placental development." The most highly upregulated 1Nr gene (4.0 fold) in this GO class is follistatin (Fst) , a repressor of activin signaling, which is required for uterine decidualization ( Fullerton et al., 2017 9. Fullerton, P.T. ∙ Monsivais, D. ∙ Kommagani, R. ... Follistatin is critical for mouse uterine receptivity and decidualization Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E4772-E4781 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three other genes in this class that are all upregulated more than 3-fold are Cited2 , which is needed for placental trophoblast production ( Withington et al., 2006 60. Withington, S.L. ∙ Scott, A.N. ∙ Saunders, D.N. ... Loss of Cited2 affects trophoblast formation and vascularization of the mouse placenta Dev. Biol. 2006; 294 :67-82 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), Pleiotropin (Ptn) , and Wilm's tumore 1 (WT1) , which are both also required for decidualization ( Yu et al., 2018 62. Yu, H.-F. ∙ Tao, R. ∙ Yang, Z.-Q. ... Ptn functions downstream of C/EBPβ to mediate the effects of cAMP on uterine stromal cell differentiation through targeting Hand2 in response to progesterone J. Cell. Physiol. 2018; 233 :1612-1626 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tamura et al., 2021 54. Tamura, I. ∙ Fujimura, T. ∙ Doi-Tanaka, Y. ... The essential glucose transporter GLUT1 is epigenetically upregulated by C/EBPβ and WT1 during decidualization of the endometrium J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297 :101150 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations suggest that pre-existing nurse cell genes may have been repurposed during the evolution of placental mammals. Later, nurse cells modulate genes involved in chromatin organization, which may promote prefollicular changes in oocyte heterochromatin ( Lei and Spradling, 2016 31. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse oocytes differentiate through organelle enrichment from sister cyst germ cells Science. 2016; 352 :95-99 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting also that nurse cells activate stage-specific expression programs, rather than a single stereotyped response.
Nurse cells also downregulate multiple genes that may promote their function. One of the most interesting is Tex14. This component of IBs was shown recently to have profound repressive effects on the kinetics of nurse cell intercellular organelle transport. In Tex14 −/− mutants, centrosome transport and Balbiani body formation is accelerated such that many E14.5 cysts already contain a Bb ( Ikami et al., 2021 23. Ikami, K. ∙ Nuzhat, N. ∙ Abbott, H. ... Altered germline cyst formation and oogenesis in Tex14 mutant mice Biol. Open. 2021; 10 :bio058807 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tex14 may also control bridge stability. Reduced Tex14 expression in activated nurse cells might destabilize bridges and open up gaps in the plasma membranes between cyst cells that are the main route for cytoplasmic transfer. The resulting reduction in repression might initiate transport in nurse cells that have received an activation signal.
We found that mouse nurse cells turn over almost exclusively by a pathway that strongly resembles the non-cell autonomous PCD pathway that has been extensively characterized in Drosophila nurse cells ( Mondragon et al., 2019 39. Mondragon, A.A. ∙ Yalonetskaya, A. ∙ Ortega, A.J. ... Lysosomal machinery drives extracellular acidification to direct non-apoptotic cell death Cell Rep. 2019; 27 :11-19.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lebo and McCall, 2021 29. Lebo, D.P.V. ∙ McCall, K. Murder on the ovarian express: a tale of non-autonomous cell death in the Drosophila ovary Cells. 2021; 10 :1454-1473 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Acidic vesicles and cathepsins are produced in pregranulosa cells that surround nurse cell remnants. These vesicles are likely transported to nurse cells since inhibiting V-ATPase activity prevented vesicle production in the pregranulosa cells and nurse cell turnover.
A much lower frequency of germ cells was positive for several markers of apoptosis. These cells did not seem to be the main pathway of nurse cell turnover, since most small nurse cells were seen to associate with pregranulosa cells and undergo acidification. Apoptotic cells may have undergone developmental arrest, but we never saw entire cysts of germ cells undergoing synchronous apoptosis, which is observed in Drosophila under certain circumstances ( Lebo and McCall, 2021 29. Lebo, D.P.V. ∙ McCall, K. Murder on the ovarian express: a tale of non-autonomous cell death in the Drosophila ovary Cells. 2021; 10 :1454-1473 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our observations help resolve the longstanding debate about why large numbers of female germ cells die during perinatal stages even in healthy, well-fed females. Although a small fraction of dying germ cells may be due to the culling of defective oocytes with chromosome abnormalities ( Tilly, 2001 57. Tilly, J.L. Commuting the death sentence: how oocytes strive to survive Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2 :838-848 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), mitochondrial dysfunction ( Palozzi et al., 2018 44. Palozzi, J.M. ∙ Jeedigunta, S.P. ∙ Hurd, T.R. Mitochondrial DNA purifying selection in mammals and invertebrates J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4834-4848 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), or LINE element activation ( Tharp et al., 2020 55. Tharp, M.E. ∙ Malki, S. ∙ Bortvin, A. Maximizing the ovarian reserve in mice by evading LINE-1 genotoxicity Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :330 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), the great majority of germ cell turnover represents nurse cells programmed to die as part of a developmental program that contributes to oocyte production.
How oocytes are selected among cyst cells has remained only partially understood despite decades of research in Drosophila , mice, and other animals. The relatively simple, invariant cysts found in Drosophila contain 16 cells interconnected by a polarized microtubule-based cytoskeleton whose minus ends all focus on the initial cell. The initial cell eventually becomes the only oocyte, after organelles and unknown "determinants" are transported into it from the remaining 15 cells that develop as nurse cells ( deCuevas and Spradling, 1998 6. de Cuevas, M. ∙ Spradling, A.C.

Symmetry breaking in the female germline cyst Science. 2021; 374 :874-879 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple mouse oocytes are chosen within even larger cysts that face the added complexity of variable interconnections and fragmentation. However, our studies suggest that similar underlying mechanisms specify oocytes and nurse cells and control cyst breakdown in both mouse and Drosophila .
First, we observed that the mouse somatic cells that continuously surround developing cysts are essential for full organelle transfer. Pregranulosa cells surround the cysts, and thin membrane extensions of these cells largely separate even individual cyst germ cells from each other, except at the ring canal and later after membranes break down. These cells likely control the overall timing of cyst maturation by controlling the pace at which new nurse cells are activated, possibly by increasing the level of their positive signal as cyst development proceeds. Individual nurse cells are probably activated when these positive signals outweigh local inhibitory signals associated with IBs. Such a system can explain the tendency of oocytes to develop from cells with the most bridges. However, the ultimate fate of cells is probably preordained by cytoskeletal asymmetries such as the cyst microtubule network we visualized associated with organelles in transit. Such polarity will ensure that transferred materials move toward a pro-oocyte as their ultimate destination.
The study of insect nurse cells that persist throughout the entire period of oocyte growth led to the view that nurse cells exist to help the oocyte achieve great size, often the species' largest cell type. However, there are several additional reasons that female gametes might benefit from sharing cytoplasm with their sister germ cells. Cysts are thought to protect male gametes from selfish meiotic drive elements and other parasites by sharing cytoplasm between potential gametes. Although unlike male gametes, oocytes remain diploid, receiving cytoplasm containing small RNA from multiple nurse cells still might assist in controlling parasites and transposable elements.
Our work suggests a third potential advantage of cysts, and cytoplasmic transfer is their role in generating the Balbiani body. Although the term "Balbiani body" has been applied to a disparate set of oocyte structures, we propose that organelles transferred from nurse cells or otherwise organized at the oocyte cytocenter at the time of follicle formation represent true Balbiani bodies that fundamentally promote oocyte development. In mouse, the multiple centrosomes acquired by transfer from nurse cells aggregate into a single structure known as the cytocentrum in dictyate oocytes, which nucleates a large microtubule aster that assembles organelles into an aggregate. Bb assembly is assisted by Tuba1c and Tubb2b. Tubb2b, was shown previously to be developmentally regulated, and its deletion causes a mild cortical structural defect ( Bittermann et al., 2019 1. Bittermann, E. ∙ Abdelhamed, Z. ∙ Liegel, R.P. ... Differential requirements of tubulin genes in mammalian forebrain development PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1008243 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collecting centrosomes from interconnected sister cells may be an ancient mechanism of oocyte polarization that has been retained in many species, including mammals.
In Drosophila , centrosomes transferred from nurse cells leave the Balbiani body as the follicle is forming and migrate to the oocyte posterior along with oskar , CPEB , and cup mRNAs ( Mahowald and Strassheim, 1970 36. Mahowald, A.P. ∙ Strassheim, J.M. Intercellular migration of centrioles in the germarium of Drosophila melanogaster. An electron microscopic study J. Cell Biol. 1970; 45 :306-320 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cox and Spradling, 2003 4. Cox, R.T. ∙ Spradling, A.C. A Balbiani body and the fusome mediate mitochondrial inheritance during Drosophila oogenesis Development. 2003; 130 :1579-1590 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). This process establishes a major microtubule organizing center (MTOC) that defines the oocyte posterior and sends important signals needed for subsequent patterning steps that involve microtubule reorientation. Although similar initial steps take place in mouse oocytes, mRNAs associated with the Bb remain to be been identified.
These studies delineate the average structure and development of mouse female germline cysts. However, the range of exact starting structures of individual cysts and their particular fragmentation patterns that give rise to this average remain to be determined. An initial cytoskeletal polarity was established, although cysts form mitotically likely guides transferred nurse cell contents to pro-oocytes, but the nature of this polarity remains to be established. The lineage-labeling method does not track remnant nurse cells after they separate from the cyst, become surrounded by somatic cells, and undergo PCD because EYFP levels after nurse cells leave the cyst have fallen too low for detection.

C57BL/6J, CAG-CreER (004682), Lgr5-CreERT2 mice (008875), and R26R-EYFP reporter mice (006148) were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory. Tuba1cem1(IMPC)J/Mmjax mice (051205-JAX), and Tubb2bem1(IMPC)J/Mmjax mice (046114-JAX), were acquired from Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Centers (MMRRC). Lgr5-DTR-EGFP mice were obtained from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). For all experiments, to set a breeding pair, two females (8 weeks or older) and one male (8 weeks or older) are housed in one cage. Vaginal plugs are checked each morning after setting up mating. Only female embryos (E12.5-E19.5) and pups (P0-P8) are collected for sample analysis. Mouse experiments in this study were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
The R26R-EYFP females were crossed with the CAG-CreER males, those with a vaginal plug were considered as E0.5. The pregnant females at E10.5 were given a single intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (Tmx; 10 mg/ml in corn oil (Sigma)) at 0.2 mg per 40 g body weight.
Pregnant mice (E14.5) were injected i.p. with 10 μg/kg of diphtheria-toxin solution (D0564, Sigma) in PBS.
Ovaries were fixed in cold 4% Paraformaldehyde overnight, incubated sequentially in 10% and 20% sucrose in PBS overnight, embedded in OCT, and stored at -80°C until cryosectioning. After high-temperature antigen retrieval with 0.01% sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0), the frozen sections (10 μm) were blocked with 10% normal donkey serum for 30 mins, and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used are presented in the key resources table . The sections were washed with wash buffer and incubated with the appropriate Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (see key resources table ; 1:200) at room temperature for 2 hs. After staining with DAPI, samples were analyzed using confocal microscopy (Leica SP5).
Ovaries were fixed in cold 4% PFA for 4 hours. After washing in PBST2 (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 90 minutes, ovaries were then incubated with primary antibodies for 48 hours at 4°C. After washing in PBST2 for 90 minutes, ovaries were incubated with secondary antibodies (see key resources table ; 1:200) overnight at 4°C. After washing in PBST2 (90 minutes) and DAPI staining (1 hour), samples were analyzed using confocal microscopy (Leica SP5).
Ovaries were dissected in cold PBS, and then cultured in 1 mL DMEM/F12 medium (ThermoFisher) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was supplemented with antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin (Fisher) to prevent bacterial contamination. Cultured ovaries were carefully placed on a membrane insert (0.4 μm, Millipore) and treated with Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1, 100nM, Abcam), which is a selective (V)-ATPase inhibitor. After 2 or 6 days in culture, ovaries were fixed in 4% PFA for further analysis.
LysoTracker red (L7528, Thermofisher) was diluted 1:10,000 in DMEM/F12 medium. Ovaries were carefully dissected and cultured in-vitro in 1 mL Lysotracker red added medium at 37°C for 12 hours. Ovaries were then harvested and fixed in 4% PFA for further analysis.
Fix frozen sections in 4% PFA for 15 min at 37°C. After washing in PBS for 5 min, add sufficient volume of Proteinase K to completely cover the section and incubate the sample for 15 min. After washing, section was fixed in 4% PFA for 5 min at 37°C. TdT reaction and Click-iT Plus reaction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After staining with DAPI, mount slides using anti-fade mounting medium and store in the dark for analysis.
Fix ovaries in 4% PFA for 2 hours on ice. Permeabilize ovaries in PBST2 for 24-48 hours on a rotator at room temperature. For tubulin cytoskeleton staining, after blocking in donkey serum (10% in PBST2) for 2 hours for decreasing background fluorescence, ovaries were then incubated with anti-alpha-tubulin antibody for 2-3 days on a rotator at room temperature. After washing in PBST2 for 90 minutes, ovaries were incubated with donkey secondary antibody for 24 hours on a rotator at room temperature. After PBST2 washing (90 minutes) and DAPI staining (1 hour), samples were analyzed using confocal microscopy (Leica SP5). For actin filament staining, ovaries were incubated with Alexa 488-Phalloidin (1 μg/mL) for 1 hour on a rotator at room temperature. After washing in PBST2 for 30 minutes and DAPI staining for 1 hour, samples were analyzed using confocal microscopy (Leica SP5).
Package “Seurat” v2.3.4 was used to analyze the scRNAseq data ( Satija et al., 2015 49. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (3233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nearly 1,800 germ cells were isolated from the large integrated scRNAseq datasets spanning from E11.5 to P5 ( Niu and Spradling, 2020 42. Niu, W. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Two distinct pathways of pregranulosa cell differentiation support follicle formation in the mouse ovary Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :20015-20026 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We re-clustered these cells to 22 clusters using FindClusters function. To carry out the analysis in a deeper resolution, we set “force.recalc” to “TRUE” for building the new SNN algorithm parameters (reduction.type = “pca”, resolution = 2.8, dims.use = 1:12). To make our dataset more accessible and usable, the data slot (seurat.object@data), which stores normalized and log-transformed single-cell expression, was extracted and converted to Table S2 . The values represent the mean milliUMI (mUMI) per cell after row sum and average of the data slot in each cluster (object@data sums and divided by cell numbers). DoHeatmap function was used to compare different meiosis genes in GC clusters with that in NC clusters ( Figure 4 A). To search for genes that are highly enriched in pro-oocyte and nurse cell unactivated, but not in nurse cell activated, “FindMarkers” function was used to compare clusters as following: cluster 1a-1e vs 1N, 1Nr; 2a-2c vs 2Nr; 3a-3c vs 3N; 4a, 4b vs 4N, 4Nr. Each pair of comparison yield a gene list, then “intersect” function was used to find common genes between these four gene lists, and 175 genes were generated in this method ( Figure S4 B). In addition, we also used “FindMarkers” function to compare dictyate GC clusters (4a, 4b) to other earlier GC clusters (1a-1e, 2a-2c, and 3a-3c) (avg_logFC>0.25; p_val_adj<E-25), and identified nearly 200 “oocyte genes/Dictyate genes/late genes” ( Figure S6 A; Table S3 ).
Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis of the up-regulated gene sets and down-regulated gene sets in nurse cells was performed using Metascape ( http://metascape.org ).
For germ cell or follicle counts, collected ovaries were fixed in 4% PFA, incubated in sucrose, embedded in OCT, and sectioned to a thickness of 10 μm. The sections were stained with DDX4 antibody and every fifth section was analyzed for the presence of germ cells. The cumulative germ cell or follicle counts were multiplied by five. For small cell counts, single germ cell was labeled at E10.5 through low TMX injection (see labeling and tracing experiments for details), and ovaries were harvested at different timepoints for analysis. Collected ovaries were fixed in 4% PFA and stained with DDX4 and EGFP antibodies for whole-mount staining. Small cells (nurse cells) can be recognized microscopically because of smaller cell volume compared to nurse cells unactivated and pro-oocytes.
Single germ cell lineage labeled ovaries (see labeling and tracing experiments ) were carefully dissected in cold PBS, and fixed in 4%PFA overnight. After 60 minutes PBST2 washing, samples were incubated with anti-YFP (clone marker) and anti-GM130 (golgi marker) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After secondary antibodies incubation and DAPI staining, samples were mounted for confocal analysis. The cyst cell that only contain little more than a nucleus and a tiny rim of cytoplasm was identified as a nurse remnant. For E18.5 and P1 ovaries, only Bb forming pro-oocytes were measured. Z-stack images were acquired through SP5 confocal microscope with a 63X oil lens. 3D images were reconstructed using Bitplane IMARIS. Nurse remant volume and pro-oocytes volume were calculated by IMARIS in the surface statistics.
For quantifying golgi in single-germ cell lineage tracing, GM130 immunostaining was performed to indicate golgi. For cysts in E18.5, P1 and P5 ovaries, only pro-oocytes with Bb (a large Golgi sphere) or a forming Bb were analyzed. Golgi were modeled as ellipsoids to calculate the approximate surface area of Golgi membranes as described previously ( Lei and Spradling, 2016 31. Lei, L. ∙ Spradling, A.C. Mouse oocytes differentiate through organelle enrichment from sister cyst germ cells Science. 2016; 352 :95-99 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Excessive mitochondria structures were clustered together in germ cells, and high background signal results in inaccurate measures of mitochondrial number. To decrease the amount of background mitochondria signal of whole-mount staining, the single germ cell lineage labeled ovaries were fixed and embedded in OCT. Series of 6 μm frozen section were collected for YFP (clone marker), GM130 (to indicate Bb sphere) and ATP5a (mitochondria marker) staining. Generally a cyst can be fully harvested in 3-6 successive sections. Individual mitochondria structure is able to be recognized in confocal z-stack analysis (0.42 μm interval) in these 6 μm sections. To quantify centrosome, frozen ovary sections were stained with anti-Pericentrin antibody, and the surface area of each centrosome foci was calculated and summed.
Data are presented as mean±SD. Data were analyzed by t-test. P-value less than 0.05 (significant) is flagged with one star. P-value less than 0.01 (very significant) is flagged with two stars. P-value less than 0.001 (extremely significant) is flagged with three stars.
