Title: Meiotic recombination mirrors patterns of germline replication in mice and humans


Abstract: Summary

Genetic recombination generates novel trait combinations, and understanding how recombination is distributed across the genome is key to modern genetics. The PRDM9 protein defines recombination hotspots; however, megabase-scale recombination patterning is independent of PRDM9. The single round of DNA replication, which precedes recombination in meiosis, may establish these patterns; therefore, we devised an approach to study meiotic replication that includes robust and sensitive mapping of replication origins. We find that meiotic DNA replication is distinct; reduced origin firing slows replication in meiosis, and a distinctive replication pattern in human males underlies the subtelomeric increase in recombination. We detected a robust correlation between replication and both contemporary and historical recombination and found that replication origin density coupled with chromosome size determines the recombination potential of individual chromosomes. Our findings and methods have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying DNA replication, genetic recombination, and the landscape of mammalian germline variation.

Section: Introduction

Sexual reproduction uses a specialized cell division called meiosis, in which a single round of DNA replication is followed by two cell divisions to create haploid gametes. Genetic recombination in meiosis assures faithful segregation of chromosomes and establishes patterns of genetic linkage and inheritance. Recombination is initiated by the formation of hundreds of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In mice and humans, DSBs are targeted by DNA sequence-specific binding of a meiosis-specific histone methyltransferase, PRDM9 ( Baudat et al., 2010 7. Baudat, F. ∙ Buard, J. ∙ Grey, C. ...

Thus, each variant may yield a distinct patterning of meiotic DSBs ( Smagulova et al., 2016 107. Smagulova, F. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Pu, Y. ... The evolutionary turnover of recombination hot spots contributes to speciation in mice Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :266-280 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, megabase-scale similarities between individuals demonstrate that a broad-scale, PRDM9-independent layer of control also shapes meiotic recombination ( Davies et al., 2016 30. Davies, B. ∙ Hatton, E. ∙ Altemose, N. ...

Genome-wide analysis reveals novel molecular features of mouse recombination hotspots Nature. 2011; 472 :375-378 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). The clearest manifestation of this is seen in the elevation of meiotic DSBs in subtelomeric DNA of human males, independent of PRDM9 genotype ( Pratto et al., 2014 97. Pratto, F. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Khil, P. ... DNA recombination. Recombination initiation maps of individual human genomes Science. 2014; 346 :1256442 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Because DNA replication determines genome structure ( Klein et al., 2021 62. Klein, K.N. ∙ Zhao, P.A. ∙ Lyu, X. ... Replication timing maintains the global epigenetic state in human cells Science. 2021; 372 :371-378 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and immediately precedes DSB formation in meiosis, we hypothesized that DNA replication may drive the broad-scale regulation of recombination in mammals. Replication and recombination are correlated in yeast ( Borde et al., 2000 15. Borde, V. ∙ Goldman, A.S. ∙ Lichten, M. Direct coupling between meiotic DNA replication and recombination initiation Science. 2000; 290 :806-809 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Murakami and Nurse, 2001 85. Murakami, H. ∙ Nurse, P. Regulation of premeiotic S phase and recombination-related double-strand DNA breaks during meiosis in fission yeast Nat. Genet. 2001; 28 :290-293 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in plants ( Higgins et al., 2012 48. Higgins, J.D. ∙ Perry, R.M. ∙ Barakate, A. ... Spatiotemporal asymmetry of the meiotic program underlies the predominantly distal distribution of meiotic crossovers in barley Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :4096-4109 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Osman et al., 2021 90. Osman, K. ∙ Algopishi, U. ∙ Higgins, J.D. ... Distal bias of meiotic crossovers in hexaploid bread wheat reflects spatio-temporal asymmetry of the meiotic program Front. Plant Sci. 2021; 12 :631323 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). A mechanistic link has been demonstrated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae where a component of the DSB machinery is activated by passage of the replication fork ( Murakami and Keeney, 2014 84. Murakami, H. ∙ Keeney, S. Temporospatial coordination of meiotic DNA replication and recombination via DDK recruitment to replisomes Cell. 2014; 158 :861-873 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). This results in a spatiotemporal coordination between replication and DSB formation.
Mammalian DNA replication is exclusively studied in cell culture. This presents difficulties in adapting techniques for studying replication in tissue, which have been mostly designed and optimized for cell culture. The paucity of studies of DNA replication in mammalian meiosis stems from the requirement to study meiosis in vivo , in the context of a complex tissue ( Handel et al., 2014 47. Handel, M.A. ∙ Eppig, J.J. ∙ Schimenti, J.C. Applying “gold standards” to in-vitro-derived germ cells Cell. 2014; 157 :1257-1261 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) and all current knowledge of DNA replication in mammalian meiosis stems from classical papers using early molecular and cytological techniques (for review, see Chandley, 1986 28. Chandley, A.C. A model for effective pairing and recombination at meiosis based on early replicating sites (R-bands) along chromosomes Hum. Genet. 1986; 72 :50-57 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To address this shortcoming, we devised a method to map origins of replication in mammalian tissue (in this case, testis), developed a cell-type-specific method to interrogate replication timing in meiotic S-phase, and designed an in silico modeling strategy to parameterize DNA replication in vivo . This tripartite approach has generated a comprehensive, parameterized description of DNA replication genome-wide in meiosis. It can similarly be applied to any mammalian tissue. We found that aspects of DNA replication in the germline are distinct from replication in other cell types. This has the potential to shape megabase-scale patterns of meiotic recombination and genome diversity.

Section: Results

To identify origins of replication, we adapted a method to sequence the RNA-primed short nascent leading strands (SNS) ( Bielinsky and Gerbi, 1998 12. Bielinsky, A.K. ∙ Gerbi, S.A. Discrete start sites for DNA synthesis in the yeast ARS1 origin Science. 1998; 279 :95-98 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). Briefly, RNA-primed leading strands are isolated by using lambda exonuclease to digest DNA that lacks an RNA primer. Okazaki fragments, although also RNA-primed, are excluded by size selection. A key improvement upon small nascent strand sequencing (SNS-seq) ( Cayrou et al., 2012 22. Cayrou, C. ∙ Grégoire, D. ∙ Coulombe, P. ...

The spatiotemporal program of DNA replication is associated with specific combinations of chromatin marks in human cells PLoS Genet. 2014; 10 :e1004282 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) is that we retain the directionality of the nascent strand (origin-derived single-stranded DNA sequencing; Ori-SSDS) ( Figure 1 A). Ori-SSDS works by ligating a sequencing adaptor directly to ssDNA; this is possible because ssDNA spontaneously forms hairpin-loop structures where the double stranded DNA stem can be processed to allow adaptor ligation ( Figure 1 A; STAR Methods ; Khil et al., 2012 61. Khil, P.P. ∙ Smagulova, F. ∙ Brick, K.M. ... Sensitive mapping of recombination hotspots using sequencing-based detection of ssDNA Genome Res. 2012; 22 :957-965 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). SSDS has previously been used to map ssDNA intermediates at meiotic DSB hotspots, where it yields an accurate estimate of DSB locations and frequency ( Khil et al., 2012 61. Khil, P.P. ∙ Smagulova, F. ∙ Brick, K.M. ...

The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using Ori-SSDS, we can omit the random-priming and second-strand synthesis steps that prevent the capture of leading strand directionality and that introduce biases ( Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2019 104. Sequeira-Mendes, J. ∙ Vergara, Z. ∙ Peiró, R. ... Differences in firing efficiency, chromatin, and transcription underlie the developmental plasticity of the Arabidopsis DNA replication origins Genome Res. 2019; 29 :784-797 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To facilitate a comparison of Ori-SSDS with other methods, we mapped origins in cultured mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where replication has been extensively studied ( Almeida et al., 2018 1. Almeida, R. ∙ Fernández-Justel, J.M. ∙ Santa-María, C. ... Chromatin conformation regulates the coordination between DNA replication and transcription Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1590 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cayrou et al., 2015 24. Cayrou, C. ∙ Ballester, B. ∙ Peiffer, I. ... The chromatin environment shapes DNA replication origin organization and defines origin classes Genome Res. 2015; 25 :1873-1885 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Petryk et al., 2018 94. Petryk, N. ∙ Dalby, M. ∙ Wenger, A. ... MCM2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication Science. 2018; 361 :1389-1392 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Characteristic bidirectional replication at origins manifests as a strand switch in sequenced reads ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Thus, distinct from SNS-seq experiments, we can differentiate true origins from non-specific signals such as G-quadruplexes by imposing a requirement for leading-strand asymmetry at origins ( Figures S1 A–S1C; STAR Methods ). 86% of replication origins in ESCs are found in SNS-based origin maps from ESCs (78% overlap origins from Almeida et al. [2018 1. Almeida, R. ∙ Fernández-Justel, J.M. ∙ Santa-María, C. ... Chromatin conformation regulates the coordination between DNA replication and transcription Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1590 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ]; 73% overlap origins from Cayrou et al. [2015 24. Cayrou, C. ∙ Ballester, B. ∙ Peiffer, I. ... The chromatin environment shapes DNA replication origin organization and defines origin classes Genome Res. 2015; 25 :1873-1885 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ]). Ori-SSDS peaks also coincide with a switch in the polarity of lagging-strand DNA synthesis (data from Okazaki-fragment sequencing in ESCs) ( Petryk et al., 2016 93. Petryk, N. ∙ Kahli, M. ∙ d’Aubenton-Carafa, Y. ... Replication landscape of the human genome Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10208 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 D and S1 D). This is consistent with replication originating at these loci.
SNS-seq experiments typically start from 1 × 10 9 exponentially growing cultured cells of which ∼30% are replicating (3 × 10 8 cells) ( Almeida et al., 2018 1. Almeida, R. ∙ Fernández-Justel, J.M. ∙ Santa-María, C. ... Chromatin conformation regulates the coordination between DNA replication and transcription Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1590 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, we performed Ori-SSDS from 2 × 10 8 cells (from two mouse testes), among which ∼2% of cells are replicating (4 × 10 6 replicating cells, 67% are meiotic) ( Figure S2 ; Kojima et al., 2019 64. Kojima, M.L. ∙ de Rooij, D.G. ∙ Page, D.C. Amplification of a broad transcriptional program by a common factor triggers the meiotic cell cycle in mice eLife. 2019; 8 :e43738 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ); this is 3 times fewer cells than in our successful Ori-SSDS experiments in ESCs, (4 × 10 7 cells; ∼1.2 × 10 7 replicating cells), 3- to 5-fold fewer than methods that immunoprecipitate pre-replication complexes (i.e., ORC1/ORC2 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]; Miotto et al., 2016 82. Miotto, B. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Struhl, K. Selectivity of ORC binding sites and the relation to replication timing, fragile sites, and deletions in cancers Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E4810-E4819 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and orders of magnitude fewer than are required for the sequencing of Okazaki fragments ( Petryk et al., 2016 93. Petryk, N. ∙ Kahli, M. ∙ d’Aubenton-Carafa, Y. ... Replication landscape of the human genome Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10208 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). We detected 11,209, 12,406, and 13,476 origins in replicate experiments from testes of individual male mice, demonstrating that our method is sufficiently sensitive to map replication origins from individual animals. 97% of Ori-SSDS peaks in the smallest testis set were found in another experiment ( Figure S1 F). No origins were detected in control experiments by using non-replicating tissue (sperm) or by removing the leading strand RNA-primer ( STAR Methods ; Figures 1 C and S1 A–S1C). Most testis origins are also found in ESCs; however, fewer origins are detected in testis than in the better ESC sample ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Origin efficiency is a measure of the frequency with which an origin is used. We use the sequencing depth of “correctly” oriented Ori-SSDS read-pairs to infer origin efficiency. This efficiency varies ∼100-fold and is highly correlated both between replicates ( Figures 1 E and S1 G–S1L; Spearman R 2 = 0.65–0.74) and between ESCs and testis origins (Spearman R 2 = 0.63–0.76). Thus, we do not find high efficiency origins unique to either testis or ESCs. The 11,339 high-confidence origins, found in at least two of three testis replicates ( Figure S1 E), were used for subsequent analyses. Together, these data show that Ori-SSDS can identify the origins of replication genome-wide from either cultured cells or from mammalian tissue.
Ori-SSDS peaks represent sites at which replication preferentially initiates in a population of cells. The overlap of the Watson and Crick signals ( Figures 1 B, 2 A, S1 B, and S1C) implies that the exact initiation point within each peak may vary by several hundred nucleotides. SNS-seq identifies up to 65,000 putative origins in mice, however, by clustering peaks within 1 kb, the number of origins inferred more closely approximates the number from Ori-SSDS ( Figures 2 A–2C). Alternative peak-calling for SNS-seq identified kilobase-scale peaks that encompassed many local SNS-seq summits within what appear to be single Ori-SSDS peaks ( Figures 2 A and 2B; IZ; Cayrou et al., 2015 24. Cayrou, C. ∙ Ballester, B. ∙ Peiffer, I. ... The chromatin environment shapes DNA replication origin organization and defines origin classes Genome Res. 2015; 25 :1873-1885 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the structure revealed by Ori-SSDS suggests that the resolution of population-scale methods that capture the leading strand for origin mapping is ∼1 kb.
Origins identified from mouse testis are unevenly distributed in the genome ( Figure S3 A) and cluster in gene rich regions; 66% of origins occur within 1 kb of a transcription start site (TSS) ( Figure S3 B). DNA at the origin center is intrinsically flexible, flanked by relatively rigid DNA. This may reflect a requirement of the ORC complex to bend DNA ( Lee et al., 2021 70. Lee, C.S.K. ∙ Cheung, M.F. ∙ Li, J. ... Humanizing the yeast origin recognition complex Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :33 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2018 76. Li, N. ∙ Lam, W.H. ∙ Zhai, Y. ... Structure of the origin recognition complex bound to DNA replication origin Nature. 2018; 559 :217-222 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 C). Origins are GC-rich, with elevated CpG, and to a lesser extent, GpC dinucleotides ( Figure S3 D). GC content, CpG density, and GpC density are all positively correlated with origin efficiency ( Figure S3 E) implying that nucleotide content plays a role in origin firing. G-quadruplexes, implicated in origin firing ( Valton et al., 2014 112. Valton, A.-L. ∙ Hassan-Zadeh, V. ∙ Lema, I. ... G4 motifs affect origin positioning and efficiency in two vertebrate replicators EMBO J. 2014; 33 :732-746 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ), are also strongly enriched at origin centers ( Figure S3 F). 68% of origins coincide with CpG islands (CGIs) in accessible chromatin (as measured by ATAC-seq in spermatogonia) ( Maezawa et al., 2018 79. Maezawa, S. ∙ Yukawa, M. ∙ Alavattam, K.G. ... Dynamic reorganization of open chromatin underlies diverse transcriptomes during spermatogenesis Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :593-608 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 G), yet only 59% of such sites are used as an origin ( Figure S3 H). CGIs in inaccessible chromatin and open chromatin lacking a CGI are far less predictive of origin locations ( Figures S3 G and S3H). We did not identify any conserved sequence motif at replication origins; however, the density of CpG dinucleotides alone can predict origin locations ( Figure S3 I). CpG density is a better predictor of origin locations than consensus motifs are for transcription factors ( Figure S3 J). Many of these observations are consistent with properties of replication origins defined in cultured cells ( Marchal et al., 2019 80. Marchal, C. ∙ Sima, J. ∙ Gilbert, D.M. Control of DNA replication timing in the 3D genome Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :721-737 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miotto et al., 2016 82. Miotto, B. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Struhl, K. Selectivity of ORC binding sites and the relation to replication timing, fragile sites, and deletions in cancers Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E4810-E4819 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and together suggest that replication in the germline initiates preferentially at CpG islands, near gene promoters, in accessible chromatin.
Broad replication initiation zones—up to 150 kb and comprising ∼7% of the genome—have been proposed as a major mode of replication initiation in humans ( Petryk et al., 2016 93. Petryk, N. ∙ Kahli, M. ∙ d’Aubenton-Carafa, Y. ... Replication landscape of the human genome Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10208 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2021 115. Wang, W. ∙ Klein, K. ∙ Proesmans, K. ... Genome-Wide Mapping of Human DNA Replication by Optical Replication Mapping Supports a Stochastic Model of Eukaryotic Replication Mol. Cell. 2021; Published online June 17, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1) Google Scholar ). The methods used to define these zones lacked the resolution to determine sub-structures below 15 kb. To assess if putative initiation zones result from closely spaced, but difficult-to-resolve discrete origins, we examined Ori-SSDS peaks wider than 10 kb (the expected width of the Ori-SSDS signal is approximately ±3 kb around the origin of replication; determined by the size selection step) ( Figures 1 A and 2 D; STAR Methods ). CpG peaks coincide with the center of isolated origins ( Figure 2 E) and we found that within our defined initiation zones, most local CpG peaks exhibited origin-like Ori-SSDS strand asymmetry, implying that these sites are de facto origins ( Figure 2 F). 620 zones contained multiple CpG peaks (n CpG Peaks = 1,645; Figure 2 G), thus, difficult-to-resolve origins account for ∼30% of initiation zones ( Figures 2 H and 2I). Among such zones is the HoxA locus, where ∼19 origins of replication occur within just 110 kb ( Figure 2 H). 816 zones contained a single CpG peak. These may represent origins where we captured longer-than-expected nascent strands. The remaining 490 zones did not contain any CpG peak above our threshold and may represent more amorphous replication initiation regions.
Stochastic origin firing and uneven origin density result in distinct earlier and later replicating parts of the genome. We inferred this replication timing (RT) in meiosis. Meiotic S-phase cells constitute ∼1% of cells in adult testis ( Kojima et al., 2019 64. Kojima, M.L. ∙ de Rooij, D.G. ∙ Page, D.C. Amplification of a broad transcriptional program by a common factor triggers the meiotic cell cycle in mice eLife. 2019; 8 :e43738 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using a variant of fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) ( Lam et al., 2019 68. Lam, K.G. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Cheng, G. ... Cell-type-specific genomics reveals histone modification dynamics in mammalian meiosis Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3821 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), we isolated up to 2 × 10 5 meiotic S-phase nuclei at ∼95% purity (inspection of wide-field images) ( Figures 3 A–3D) from a single adult mouse; this relied on a combination of DNA content, negative selection for a marker of non-meiotic cells (DMRT1), and positive selection for a meiotic protein (STRA8). A marker not used for sorting, but with expected meiotic expression (SYCP3), validated the purity of the meiotic population ( Figure 3 C). We then inferred meiotic RT from coverage imbalances in whole-genome sequencing of these nuclei (RT-seq) ( STAR Methods ; Koren et al., 2014 66. Koren, A. ∙ Handsaker, R.E. ∙ Kamitaki, N. ... Genetic variation in human DNA replication timing Cell. 2014; 159 :1015-1026 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Replication origin density is high in early replicating regions and low in late-replicating DNA ( Figure 3 E). This yields a snapshot of replication timing in mammalian meiosis. We also inferred RT from the other major replicating cell types in adult testis—undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia—and from published whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of other cell types ( Figure S4 ; STAR Methods ). Meiotic RT profiles are highly correlated among replicates and, to a lesser extent, with RT from other cell types ( Figures 3 E–3G and S4 ). In particular, meiotic RT is notably similar to RT in the cells that immediately precede meiotic S-phase and to RT in other undifferentiated cells (PGCs, SSCs, and ESCs). RT correlates to varying degrees with GC-content (Spearman R 2 = 0.27–0.40) and with the two major nuclear compartments (active [A] and inactive [B]) defined by chromatin conformation capture experiments (Hi-C; data from Patel et al., 2019 92. Patel, L. ∙ Kang, R. ∙ Rosenberg, S.C. ... Dynamic reorganization of the genome shapes the recombination landscape in meiotic prophase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :164-174 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Spearman R 2 = 0.57–0.70) ( Figure 3 H) (for review, see Vouzas and Gilbert, 2021 113. Vouzas, A.E. ∙ Gilbert, D.M. Mammalian DNA Replication Timing Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2021; Published online February 8, 2021 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
RT-seq yields a static snapshot of replication, and these snapshots from different cell types are often remarkably similar. Furthermore, the differences between RT-seq profiles are difficult to interpret because RT-seq is influenced by the stage of S-phase progression and by the relative synchrony of the population ( Figure S5 A) ( Zhao et al., 2020 125. Zhao, P.A. ∙ Sasaki, T. ∙ Gilbert, D.M. High-resolution Repli-Seq defines the temporal choreography of initiation, elongation and termination of replication in mammalian cells Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :76 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that subtle differences in the properties of replication among cell types could be captured by in silico modeling.
We built an in silico model of DNA replication (RT-sim) that requires initiation sites as input and that outputs a simulated RT profile. By examining the properties of replication that produce a best-fit between simulated and experimental RT, we can understand the parameters of replication that yield different RT profiles. Modeling parameters are the number of active forks, whether to use origin efficiency estimates as a firing probability, and the total duration of simulated S-phase. Replication fork speed is assumed constant among cell types and throughout S-phase. After an initial round of simultaneous origin firing, further origins fire only when extant forks collide; this simulates the presence of factors that limit the number of active origins (replisome ceiling), deemed important by previous simulations of DNA replication ( Gindin et al., 2014 41. Gindin, Y. ∙ Valenzuela, M.S. ∙ Aladjem, M.I. ... A chromatin structure-based model accurately predicts DNA replication timing in human cells Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10 :722 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kelly and Callegari, 2019 58. Kelly, T. ∙ Callegari, A.J. Dynamics of DNA replication in a eukaryotic cell Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :4973-4982 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In silico modeling accurately recapitulated experimental RT from both meiotic ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and S6 ) and non-meiotic S-phase cells (ESCs) ( Figures 4 B, 4C, and S6 ). We could not obtain good-fitting models for non-replicating cells (2C) or when origin locations were randomized ( Figure 4 B). Our success in modeling RT in all cell types using either testis or ESC-derived origins implies that a common set of high-efficiency origins are used during meiotic and mitotic replication. Indeed, in yeast, origins of replication are common to meiotic and mitotic cells ( Blitzblau et al., 2012 14. Blitzblau, H.G. ∙ Chan, C.S. ∙ Hochwagen, A. ... Separation of DNA replication from the assembly of break-competent meiotic chromosomes PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002643 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu and Nurse, 2014 118. Wu, P.-Y.J. ∙ Nurse, P. Replication origin selection regulates the distribution of meiotic recombination Mol. Cell. 2014; 53 :655-662 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most origins coincide with CpG islands in open chromatin ( Figure S3 G), which are broadly similar across cell types ( Table S4 ). RT-sim using these loci as a proxy for origins yields models that are slightly worse than those using de facto origins (AS+CGI) ( Figure 4 B). Finally, RT-sim does not explicitly distinguish between “early” and “late” firing replication origins, suggesting that the paradigm of early and late origins is not required to explain RT. Instead, early and late replicating regions are defined by high and low origin density, respectively. This is consistent with recent studies in other mammalian cell types ( Dileep and Gilbert, 2018 34. Dileep, V. ∙ Gilbert, D.M. Single-cell replication profiling to measure stochastic variation in mammalian replication timing Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :427 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gindin et al., 2014 41.

Genome-wide stability of the DNA replication program in single mammalian cells Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :529-540 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To validate that RT-sim can explain meaningful properties of replication, we examined model run-time of best-fitting models for very early, early, middle, and late S-phase nuclei ( Figure 4 D). Optimal model runtime—defined as the time at which simulated RT best fits experimental RT—should reflect the time a population has spent in S-phase. Indeed, optimal runtime got progressively longer from very early through late S-phase populations ( Figure 4 D). Importantly, differences in experimental RT do not substantially affect model estimates of S-phase duration ( Figure 4 D); accurate estimates of S-phase duration are difficult to obtain in mammalian meiosis ( Kofman-Alfaro and Chandley, 1970 63. Kofman-Alfaro, S. ∙ Chandley, A.C. Meiosis in the male mouse. An autoradiographic investigation Chromosoma. 1970; 31 :404-420 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). We find that for best-fitting models, median S-phase duration in meiosis is 1.4- to 1.8-fold longer than in spermatogonia ( Figures 4 E and S7 ), despite having highly correlated experimentally measured RT ( Figure 3 G). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the slow-down of DNA replication in meiosis may be partly to facilitate recombination, because knocking out Spo11 —the protein that makes meiotic DSBs—reduces S-phase duration by 30% ( Cha et al., 2000 26. Cha, R.S. ∙ Weiner, B.M. ∙ Keeney, S. ... Progression of meiotic DNA replication is modulated by interchromosomal interaction proteins, negatively by Spo11p and positively by Rec8p Genes Dev. 2000; 14 :493-503 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We found no reduction in meiotic S-phase duration in Spo11 −/− mice ( Figure S7 ).
The extended duration of meiotic S-phase results from the use of fewer replisomes; best-fitting models use 0.25 ± 0.04 replisomes Mb −1 in meiosis (mean ± SD; ∼675 replisomes per haploid genome; 2,700 Mb genome), compared to 0.69 ± 0.10 replisomes Mb −1 in ESCs (∼1,850 replisomes per haploid genome) ( Figures 4 F and S7 ). The estimates from other cell types are similar to the replisome count in cultured mouse C2C12 cells (imaging-based estimates; 0.46–0.48 replisomes Mb −1 ) ( Chagin et al., 2016 27. Chagin, V.O. ∙ Casas-Delucchi, C.S. ∙ Reinhart, M. ... 4D Visualization of replication foci in mammalian cells corresponding to individual replicons Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11231 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). One consequence of using fewer origins in meiosis is extended replication tract length ( Figure S5 ). This mirrors findings in newt spermatocytes, where replication tracts were notably longer than in mitotic cells ( Callan, 1973 21. Callan, H.G. DNA replication in the chromosomes of eukaryotes Hamkalo, B.A. ∙ Papaconstantinou, J. (Editors) Molecular Cytogenetics Springer New York, 1973; 31-47 Google Scholar ). Although we do not explicitly model fork speed, universally altering fork speed without changing origin density cannot explain the presence of longer replication tracts in meiosis. Indeed, in other organisms, fork speed does not vary between meiosis and mitosis ( Borde et al., 2000 15. Borde, V. ∙ Goldman, A.S. ∙ Lichten, M. Direct coupling between meiotic DNA replication and recombination initiation Science. 2000; 290 :806-809 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Callan, 1973 21. Callan, H.G. DNA replication in the chromosomes of eukaryotes Hamkalo, B.A. ∙ Papaconstantinou, J. (Editors) Molecular Cytogenetics Springer New York, 1973; 31-47 Google Scholar ). By extrapolating from published estimates of S-phase duration in intermediate-stage spermatogonia (12.5 hr) ( Monesi, 1962 83. Monesi, V. Autoradiographic study of DNA synthesis and the cell cycle in spermatogonia and spermatocytes of mouse testis using tritiated thymidine J. Cell Biol. 1962; 14 :1-18 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we estimate that meiotic S-phase in mice takes 21–24 h. Interestingly, the range of S-phase duration estimates for the best-fitting models of meiotic S-phase is larger than that of the other populations ( Figures 4 E and S7 ). A similar spread in meiotic S-phase duration is seen in yeast ( Cha et al., 2000 26. Cha, R.S. ∙ Weiner, B.M. ∙ Keeney, S. ... Progression of meiotic DNA replication is modulated by interchromosomal interaction proteins, negatively by Spo11p and positively by Rec8p Genes Dev. 2000; 14 :493-503 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Programmed DSB formation in meiosis occurs after DNA replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , passage of the replication fork favors meiotic DSB formation ( Murakami and Keeney, 2014 84. Murakami, H. ∙ Keeney, S. Temporospatial coordination of meiotic DNA replication and recombination via DDK recruitment to replisomes Cell. 2014; 158 :861-873 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). This interplay is unexplored in mammalian genomes. In mice and humans, local DSB patterning is determined by the sequence-specific binding of PRDM9 ( Baudat et al., 2010 7. Baudat, F. ∙ Buard, J. ∙ Grey, C. ... PRDM9 is a major determinant of meiotic recombination hotspots in humans and mice Science. 2010; 327 :836-840 Crossref Scopus (606) PubMed Google Scholar ; Myers et al., 2010 88.

Drive against hotspot motifs in primates implicates the PRDM9 gene in meiotic recombination Science. 2010; 327 :876-879 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet at megabase scales, DSB density is highly correlated between individuals with different PRDM9 alleles ( Davies et al., 2016 30.

Genome-wide analysis reveals novel molecular features of mouse recombination hotspots Nature. 2011; 472 :375-378 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because RT domains occur over megabase scales, we asked whether DNA replication may underlie the megabase-scale control of DSB patterning.
Meiotic DSBs form through a well-documented cascade; PRDM9 tri-methylates H3K4 ( Brick et al., 2012 17. Brick, K. ∙ Smagulova, F. ∙ Khil, P. ...

A DSB is made by SPO11, which is then released with a short oligonucleotide ( Bergerat et al., 1997 11. Bergerat, A. ∙ de Massy, B. ∙ Gadelle, D. ...

The 5′ DNA is resected, and DMC1 loads on exposed ssDNA to facilitate homologous recombination ( Bishop et al., 1992 13. Bishop, D.K. ∙ Park, D. ∙ Xu, L. ...

DSBs ultimately repair as a crossover (CO) or as a non-crossover (NCO). H3K4me3 ChIP-seq, SPO11-associated oligo mapping ( Lange et al., 2016 69. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ), DMC1 ChIP-single-stranded DNA sequencing ( Brick et al., 2012 17. Brick, K. ∙ Smagulova, F. ∙ Khil, P. ... Genetic recombination is directed away from functional genomic elements in mice Nature. 2012; 485 :642-645 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ), and repair outcome mapping (COs/NCOs) provide quantitative readouts of intermediates in this cascade ( Figure 5 A).
We found that all measures of recombination are enriched in the early replicating regions (ERRs) ( Figure 5 ). Nonetheless, informative differences are apparent. PRDM9-mediated H3K4m3 and DSB frequency are similarly enriched relative to RT ( Figure 5 B). Both profiles “flatten” in the earliest replicating DNA and this likely reflects hotspot erosion ( Boulton et al., 1997 16. Boulton, A. ∙ Myers, R.S. ∙ Redfield, R.J. The hotspot conversion paradox and the evolution of meiotic recombination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94 :8058-8063 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Myers et al., 2010 88. Myers, S. ∙ Bowden, R. ∙ Tumian, A. ... Drive against hotspot motifs in primates implicates the PRDM9 gene in meiotic recombination Science. 2010; 327 :876-879 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ), a process by which strong PRDM9 binding sites are purged from the genome ( Figure 5 C). Hotspot erosion is indicative of historical recombination, reinforcing the strong association between RT and recombination. Thus, the action of PRDM9 decouples replication and recombination through the erosion of PRDM9 binding sites. In contrast to PRDM9-mediated H3K4me3 and SPO11-oligo density, DSB repair intermediates (DMC1-SSDS and RPA-SSDS) are relatively depleted in the very earliest replicating regions ( Figures 5 B, 5D, and 5F). SSDS captures both the frequency ( Lange et al., 2016 69. Lange, J. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tischfield, S.E. ... The Landscape of Mouse Meiotic Double-Strand Break Formation, Processing, and Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :695-708.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the lifetime ( Pratto et al., 2014 97. Pratto, F. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Khil, P. ... DNA recombination. Recombination initiation maps of individual human genomes Science. 2014; 346 :1256442 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) of DSB repair intermediates. Because DSB frequency closely mirrors PRDM9-mediated H3K4me3, we conclude that DSBs forming in ERRs are more rapidly repaired than those elsewhere. A similar, but less pronounced pattern may also implicate rapid repair in late replicating regions ( Figures 5 B and 5D). The signature of rapid repair is not seen in DMC1-SSDS from a mouse in which all meiotic DSBs remain unrepaired ( Hop2 −/− ) ( Figure 5 F). Rapid DSB repair in ERRs is seen in mice that lack PRDM9 ( Prdm9 −/− ) ( Figure 5 F) and is therefore independent of the mechanisms that determine the local patterning of meiotic DSBs.
To simplify the study of repair outcomes, we turned to mice homozygous for a “humanized” PRDM9 allele; this allele has a binding preference not found naturally in mice, and therefore, has left no footprint of hotspot erosion. In these mice, PRDM9-mediated H3K4me3 is linearly correlated with RT ( Figure 5 D), whereas the DMC1-SSDS signal still shows a relative depletion, indicative of rapid repair. We found that all inter-homolog repair products (COs and NCOs) were depleted in the earliest replicating DNA, where rapid DSB repair is occurring ( Figures 5 E and 5G). The “missing” repair outcomes likely result from DSBs that use the sister chromatid as a repair template (sister chromatids are genetically identical thus repair products cannot be detected). Inter-sister DSB repair is generally disfavored in meiosis to assure crossover formation between homologs. This inter-homolog bias appears to be gradually established, such that the earliest-forming DSBs can still repair from the sister chromatid ( Joshi et al., 2015 55. Joshi, N. ∙ Brown, M.S. ∙ Bishop, D.K. ... Gradual implementation of the meiotic recombination program via checkpoint pathways controlled by global DSB levels Mol. Cell. 2015; 57 :797-811 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sandhu et al., 2020 103. Sandhu, R. ∙ Monge Neria, F. ∙ Monge Neria, J. ...

Cell. 2020; 53 :458-472.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings therefore imply that DSBs at the earliest replicating DNA also form early in meiosis.
Chromosome-scale regulation of recombination is a PRDM9-independent aspect of recombination patterning. Short chromosomes are statistically less likely to receive a crossover-competent DSB, yet mechanisms exist to assure that they do ( Duret and Galtier, 2009 36. Duret, L. ∙ Galtier, N. Biased gene conversion and the evolution of mammalian genomic landscapes Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10 :285-311 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaback et al., 1992 56.

Murakami, H. ∙ Lam, I. ∙ Huang, P.-C. ... Multilayered mechanisms ensure that short chromosomes recombine in meiosis Nature. 2020; 582 :124-128 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mouse males, short chromosomes have a higher crossover density ( Figure 6 A), however, much of the variance in crossover density remains unexplained. Origin density varies 3-fold among mouse chromosomes (chr11 = 122 Mb, 1,023 origins; chr13 = 120 Mb, 327 origins) and is positively correlated with crossover density (Spearman R 2 = 0.4). We derived a more integrated metric of replication from RT-sim models that measures how quickly chromosomes are replicated relative to each other (replication speed) ( Figure 6 B). This accounts for stochastic origin firing and competition between chromosomes for limiting firing factors. Alone, replication speed can predict crossover density better than origin density ( Figures 6 C and 6D) and when coupled with chromosome size in a multiple linear regression model can explain 90% of the per-chromosome variance in crossover density ( Figures 6 E and 6F). This model is only marginally improved by including estimates of DSB frequency ( Figure 6 G). Strikingly, this implies that the recombination potential of chromosomes is mostly established before DSB formation.
In human males, like in mice, meiotic DSBs exhibit megabase-scale correlations across the genome ( Figure 7 A). An overt manifestation of this phenotype is seen at the ends of chromosomes, where both DSBs ( Pratto et al., 2014 97. Pratto, F. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Khil, P. ... DNA recombination. Recombination initiation maps of individual human genomes Science. 2014; 346 :1256442 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) and crossovers (Coop et al., 2008) 29. Coop, G. ∙ Wen, X. ∙ Ober, C. ... High-resolution mapping of crossovers reveals extensive variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among humans Science. 2008; 319 :1395-1398 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar are grossly enriched in males, independent of PRDM9 genotype ( Figure 7 B).
We inferred replication timing from meiotic S-phase nuclei from human testes ( Figures 7 C–7E). Subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes replicate early and therefore, germline RT is highly correlated with DSB hotspot density (R 2 = 0.75) ( Figures 7 B and 7F). The distal pattern of early replication in male meiosis is highly distinct, as subtelomeric DNA does not replicate notably early in any of the other cell types we studied ( Figure 7 F). This germline-specific RT patterning may explain why only a weak link was found between RT in a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) and meiotic recombination ( Koren et al., 2012 65. Koren, A. ∙ Polak, P. ∙ Nemesh, J. ... Differential relationship of DNA replication timing to different forms of human mutation and variation Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 91 :1033-1040 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). GC-content is also elevated in subtelomeric DNA ( Figure 7 G); thus, RT in the germline is better correlated with genomic GC-content than RT in other cell types ( Figure 7 H). Importantly, the earliest meiotic DSBs in human males are detected almost exclusively in subtelomeric DNA ( Pratto et al., 2014 97. Pratto, F. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Khil, P. ... DNA recombination. Recombination initiation maps of individual human genomes Science. 2014; 346 :1256442 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, early DNA replication in distal regions in the germline appears to underlie the spatiotemporal patterning of meiotic recombination in human males.

Section: Discussion

Aside from a cadre of classical papers in the 1970s, few studies have addressed the intricacies of meiotic DNA replication in mammals at a molecular level. Here, we developed a framework to study DNA replication in vivo .
To map origins of replication in the few S-phase cells found in the mammalian testis, we adapted methods for nascent-strand sequencing to retain the directionality of captured strands. This generated a high-confidence map of ∼11,500 origins of replication in the testis, and paves the way for future studies in other cell types. Replication origins appear to be determined by the combination of open chromatin and CpG density and the origins identified in testis and cultured ESCs mostly coincide. These likely represent a core set of cell-type-agnostic replication origins. This does not negate the possibility of low-efficiency, environment dependent or cell-type specific origins ( Smith et al., 2016 109. Smith, O.K. ∙ Kim, R. ∙ Fu, H. ... Distinct epigenetic features of differentiation-regulated replication origins Epigenetics Chromatin. 2016; 9 :18 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Despite using the same population of replication origins, we exposed fundamental differences in S-phase duration among cell-types through in silico modeling. Meiotic S-phase is notably long in a variety of organisms ( Bennett et al., 1972 9. Bennett, M.D. ∙ Smith, J.B. ∙ Riley, R. The effects of polyploidy on meiotic duration and pollen development in cereal anthers Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1972; 181 :81-107 Crossref Google Scholar ; Callan, 1973 21. Callan, H.G.

Cha, R.S. ∙ Weiner, B.M. ∙ Keeney, S. ... Progression of meiotic DNA replication is modulated by interchromosomal interaction proteins, negatively by Spo11p and positively by Rec8p Genes Dev. 2000; 14 :493-503 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Holm, 1977 51. Holm, P.B. The premeiotic DNA replication of euchromatin and heterochromatin in Lilium longiflorum (Thunb.) Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1977; 42 :249-281 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We found that meiotic S-phase in mice is ∼1.8 times longer than in the germ-cells that precede meiosis; experimental estimates are ∼15 h and ∼30 h in Spermatogonia-B and Spermatocytes, respectively ( Ghosal and Mukherjee, 1971 40. Ghosal, S.K. ∙ Mukherjee, B.B. The chronology of DNA synthesis, meiosis and spermiogenesis in the male mouse and Golden hamster Can. J. Genet. Cytol. 1971; 13 :672-682 Crossref Google Scholar ; Monesi, 1962 83. Monesi, V. Autoradiographic study of DNA synthesis and the cell cycle in spermatogonia and spermatocytes of mouse testis using tritiated thymidine J. Cell Biol. 1962; 14 :1-18 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To accurately model replication, a limiting factor that caps the number of active replisomes is required ( Gindin et al., 2014 41. Gindin, Y. ∙ Valenzuela, M.S. ∙ Aladjem, M.I. ... A chromatin structure-based model accurately predicts DNA replication timing in human cells Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10 :722 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that this replisome “ceiling” differs among cell types, and, in turn, modulates S-phase duration. Investigating the factors that slow down meiotic S-phase may help identify genes that modulate S-phase duration more generally. In yeast, the meiosis-specific Spo11p protein may play a role, however, we found that SPO11 does not regulate S-phase duration in mouse meiosis. Our model only allows alteration of the global properties of replication, however, regional modifiers of replication fork speed such as replication slow zones ( Cha and Kleckner, 2002 25. Cha, R.S. ∙ Kleckner, N. ATR homolog Mec1 promotes fork progression, thus averting breaks in replication slow zones Science. 2002; 297 :602-606 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) or common fragile sites ( Smith et al., 2006 108. Smith, D.I. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ McAvoy, S. ... Common fragile sites, extremely large genes, neural development and cancer Cancer Lett. 2006; 232 :48-57 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ) may impede fork progression differentially in meiosis and other cell types.
Together, these analyses suggest both that the origins captured by Ori-SSDS reflect meiotic replication initiation and that the same origins can yield tangibly different RT profiles if other properties of replication vary. This tripartite approach of origin mapping, RT-seq and in silico modeling, offers an alternative to classical cytogenetic approaches and yields a more comprehensive description of the DNA replication landscape.
Our tripartite approach to describe and parameterize DNA replication enabled us to infer meiotic RT with high temporal resolution in early replicating DNA. This strategy offers an alternative to recently developed experimental methods ( Zhao et al., 2020 125. Zhao, P.A. ∙ Sasaki, T. ∙ Gilbert, D.M. High-resolution Repli-Seq defines the temporal choreography of initiation, elongation and termination of replication in mammalian cells Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :76 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) that would be difficult to apply to replication in mammalian meiosis. We found a strong positive correlation between multiple metrics of recombination and early replicating DNA. Opportunistic binding of PRDM9 to more accessible chromatin in early replicated DNA may establish a link between replication and recombination, however, we also found analogous enrichment in the absence of functional PRDM9. Therefore, broad-scale patterning of recombination acts independent of the factors that determine the local patterning of meiotic DSBs.
We found strong evidence for the rapid repair of meiotic DSBs in early replicating parts of the genome. The rapid repair of DSBs is a correlate of crossover-biased resolution ( Hinch et al., 2019 49. Hinch, A.G. ∙ Zhang, G. ∙ Becker, P.W. ... Factors influencing meiotic recombination revealed by whole-genome sequencing of single sperm Science. 2019; 363 :eaau8861 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), however, we find that all interhomolog repair outcomes are depleted in these regions suggesting increased use of the sister-chromatid as a repair template. In meiosis, DSB repair with the sister chromatid is strongly disfavored and, at least in yeast, this inter-homolog bias is established gradually. Thus inter-sister recombination is more likely at the earliest DSBs ( Joshi et al., 2015 55. Joshi, N. ∙ Brown, M.S. ∙ Bishop, D.K. ... Gradual implementation of the meiotic recombination program via checkpoint pathways controlled by global DSB levels Mol. Cell. 2015; 57 :797-811 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sandhu et al., 2020 103. Sandhu, R. ∙ Monge Neria, F. ∙ Monge Neria, J. ...

Cell. 2020; 53 :458-472.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore infer that the earliest DSBs occur in the earliest replicating DNA, strongly implicating a mechanistic link between replication timing per se and DSB formation. This would also imply that correlates of replication timing such as GC-content, genome compartmentalization, heterochromatin, or gene density, which lack any temporal component, may indirectly affect recombination by modifying replication patterns. In human males, the earliest meiotic DSBs occur almost exclusively in subtelomeric DNA ( Pratto et al., 2014 97. Pratto, F. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Khil, P. ... DNA recombination. Recombination initiation maps of individual human genomes Science. 2014; 346 :1256442 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). This coincides with the earliest replicating DNA, reinforcing that there may be a direct link between replication and recombination initiation. It is possible that two phenomena modulate recombination at large scales; one that temporally favors early-forming DSBs in the wake of a passing replication fork (like in yeast), and another that favors recombination in the resultant “permissive” chromatin environment. Because DNA replication establishes the 3D structure of the genome ( Klein et al., 2021 62. Klein, K.N. ∙ Zhao, P.A. ∙ Lyu, X. ... Replication timing maintains the global epigenetic state in human cells Science. 2021; 372 :371-378 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), these two effects may be one and the same.
It is well established that chromosome size partly determines per chromosome recombination rates ( Duret and Galtier, 2009 36. Duret, L. ∙ Galtier, N.

Murakami, H. ∙ Lam, I. ∙ Huang, P.-C. ... Multilayered mechanisms ensure that short chromosomes recombine in meiosis Nature. 2020; 582 :124-128 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that in mouse males, the per-chromosome origin density has a similar predictive value; further, the predictive power of chromosome size and replication are additive, implying that they represent uncorrelated aspects of the mechanisms controlling per chromosome recombination rates. Together, almost all of the per chromosome variation in crossover density can be explained by these two properties, suggesting that recombination will follow a deterministic path, established before DSBs are made. Short chromosomes likely benefit from an elevated recombination rate to assure crossover formation. Fast-replicating chromosomes are origin rich, GC-rich, and have elevated gene density. A mechanism that links replication to recombination would assure that such regions benefit from recombination to break linkage blocks, generate diversity, and purge deleterious mutations.
Our finding that subtelomeric DNA replicates notably early in the human male germline has implications for understanding the patterning of de novo variation in the genome and its impact on population genetic structure. In human males, germline DNA replication mirrors GC content more closely than replication in other cell types. Thus, during development, we propose that replication may follow a well-charted course, dictated by the underlying DNA and its biophysical properties. The commitment to differentiation in other cell types may render replication more susceptible to epigenetic regulation ( Hiratani et al., 2010 50. Hiratani, I. ∙ Ryba, T. ∙ Itoh, M. ... Genome-wide dynamics of replication timing revealed by in vitro models of mouse embryogenesis Genome Res. 2010; 20 :155-169 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). One intriguing possibility is that the link between replication, recombination, and GC content is a self-reinforcing cycle; GC-rich regions replicate early, facilitating recombination that increases GC content via GC-biased gene conversion.
We restricted peak calling to a high confidence set of Ori-SSDS peaks in testis. Approximately 40% more peaks can be identified in individual experiments and more by relaxing peak calling thresholds. From examining Watson-Crick asymmetry, a substantial fraction of additional peaks appear to represent low efficiency origins.
Although replication origins can be unambiguously mapped in mammalian tissue, a caveat of this study is that the origins we identified from testis are not uniquely from meiotic cells. Further work is required to adapt our method for sorted populations of cells/nuclei.
In our simulations, the final 5%–10% of the genome takes far too long to replicate because at that point, all origins have either fired or have been passively replicated. Allowing for either an increase in the speed of DNA replication or the firing of diffuse origins in the latest replicating parts of the genome would rectify this. However, we have no experimental data to support either phenomenon.
We identify robust and sensible temporal and spatial correlates of replication and recombination but have not demonstrated a mechanistic link. Genetic perturbations of the replication machinery are challenging ( Sima et al., 2019 105. Sima, J. ∙ Chakraborty, A. ∙ Dileep, V. ...

The data from our experiments and the methods we developed will enable such experiments in the future.

C57BL/6J (stock 000664) and CAST/Eij (000928) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Maine).
The Spo11 null mice ( Spo11 −/− ) were generated by deleting the 13 kb Spo11 genomic locus with CRISPR-Cas9. Briefly, two target sites (upstream of Spo11: TAGAGCGCGGAAAGGTTCGC; downstream of Spo11: CGAACCTTGAGAGGTTGCGA) were selected using CRISPR.mit.edu . The gRNA-targeting vectors were constructed by incorporating the annealed oligos containing target sites into the PX459 vector ( Ran et al., 2013 101. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (4866) PubMed Google Scholar ). The vectors carrying each gRNA were injected simultaneously into the pronucleus of zygotes obtained from C57BL/6J (stock 000664) mice. The injected zygotes were implanted into the oviduct of one pseudo-pregnant foster mother. To produce Spo11 −/− mice, heterozygous mice were intercrossed. Mice were genotyped by PCR on tail tip DNA, using the primers Spo11NullF, Spo11NullR and Spo11ex4R. Spo11NullF and Spo11Ex4R give an ∼700 bp product indicative of the wild-type allele, whereas Spo11NullF and Spo11NullR give an ∼350 bp fragment if the targeted allele is present. The phenotype of these mice is indistinguishable from extensively studied Spo11 knockouts ( Baudat et al., 2000 6. Baudat, F. ∙ Manova, K. ∙ Yuen, J.P. ...

Animals were maintained in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All procedures for animal use were approved by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice had unrestricted access to regular mouse chow and water.
Mouse 129X1/SvJ-PRX-129X1 #1 Embryonic Stem Cells were obtained from Jackson labs. These cells were derived from day 3.5 blastocysts of strain 129X1/SvJ (Stock Number 000691) and expanded on primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in medium containing 1000U/mL LIF and cultured at 7.5% CO 2 in humidified air at 37°C.
We obtained human testicular samples from two individuals. Individual 1 was a deceased 24-year-old white male; deidentified donor testes material was obtained with the assistance of the Washington Regional Transplant Community. Individual 2 was a 47-year-old white male; material was normal adjacent tissue from a testicular biopsy provided by a commercial source (Folio, Ohio). The testis material for the DMC1-SSDS experiment was from a 31-year-old African-American male provided by a commercial source (Folio, Ohio).
For the short nascent strands (SNS) preparation we adapted the protocol from Picard et al. (2014) 95. Picard, F. ∙ Cadoret, J.-C. ∙ Audit, B. ... The spatiotemporal program of DNA replication is associated with specific combinations of chromatin marks in human cells PLoS Genet. 2014; 10 :e1004282 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar to work with mouse tissue. Mice were euthanized and testes were retrieved. The tunica albuginea was removed and both testes were suspended in 10 mL of DNAzol and transferred to a Dounce homogenizer. Tissue and cells were disrupted with 5-7 strokes of a loose-fitting pestle. The DNA was precipitated with 5 mL of EtOH and then spooled with a pipette tip and rinsed gently twice with EtOH 75% by sequential transfer into 15 mL tubes. DNA was air-dried for 5 min and then resuspended in 500 μL of 1X TEN buffer (Tris 10mM pH = 8; EDTA 1mM; NaCl 100mM) + 80 U of RNase inhibitor (40 U/μl) at 4°C for at least 24h.
DNA was denatured at 95°C for 5 min, chilled on ice for 5 min and size-fractionated on 5 - 30% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients in TEN buffer in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge SW45Ti rotor for 18 h at 26,000 g at 20°C. 500 ul fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, precipitated by adding 1 mL of EtOH 100% and 50 μL of NaOAc 3M pH 5.2 and resuspended in 25 μL Tris Buffer pH = 8. Fractions were analyzed in a denaturing (50 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA) 1.2% agarose gel and the ones containing ssDNA ranging in size from 800 to 2000 nt were pooled. The sample was then heat-denatured for 5 min at 95°C and chilled on ice for 5 min and DNA was phosphorylated by Polynucleotide Kinase in 150 ul reactions in PNK Buffer (100 U of PNK; 1X PNK buffer; 1 mM ATP; 40U RNase Inhibitor). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and heat-inactivated at 75°C for 15 min. DNA was extracted twice with Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl, once with Chloroform/Isoamyl, EtOH precipitated and resuspended in 50 μL Tris Buffer pH = 8. Samples were heat-denatured again for 5 min and digested with lambda-exonuclease in 100 μL of custom lambda buffer (67 mM glycine-KOH pH = 8.8, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 μg/ml BSA) with 2.5 - 10 U lambda-exonuclease/μg DNA. Note that these estimates of DNA concentration are affected by the presence of RNA carried over from the sucrose gradient. From the denaturing agarose gels (above) we estimated the ssDNA concentration to be 3-5 ng/μl. This yields ∼500 ng in total. Thus, the ratio of lambda-exo: ssDNA may be as high as 100U/μg. 80U RNase inhibitor, 5U of PNK and 1 mM ATP were added to the sample and incubated overnight at 37°C. Reactions were inactivated for 10 min at 75°C and DNA was purified with Qiaquick columns (QIAGEN), as indicated by the instruction manual. RNA primers were hydrolyzed by incubating the eluate for 5 min at 95°C in 0.1 N NaOH, followed by neutralization with HCl and purified again with Qiaquick kit. The sample was recovered in 50 μL of EB buffer; the final concentration is typically below the detection limit for Nanodrop. The sample was then sonicated in a Bioruptor UCD200 for 8-10 min 30 s ON 30 s OFF, “high” setting.
Next, we used a library preparation protocol, SSDS, that allows for the direct ligation of sequencing adapters to ssDNA (for details of the molecular intermediates and underlying concepts of SSDS, see Figure 1 A and Khil et al., 2012 61. Khil, P.P. ∙ Smagulova, F. ∙ Brick, K.M. ... Sensitive mapping of recombination hotspots using sequencing-based detection of ssDNA Genome Res. 2012; 22 :957-965 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; for a comprehensive protocol, see Brick et al., 2018a 18. Brick, K. ∙ Pratto, F. ∙ Sun, C.-Y. ... Analysis of Meiotic Double-Strand Break Initiation in Mammals Methods Enzymol. 2018; 601 :391-418 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Illumina sequencing adapters require a blunt-end for ligation. For most experiments, the end-repair of broken dsDNA creates these blunt-ends. In contrast, SSDS generates a blunt-end from ssDNA. For this, it relies on the intrinsic propensity of ssDNA to form intramolecular hairpin-loop structures. Processing of these hairpins with end-repair enzymes generates a blunt-end that allows the ligation of Illumina sequencing adapters directly to the ssDNA without first converting it to dsDNA. Illumina sequencing adapters are not fully complementary and have distinct sequences that ligate to the 5′ end and the 3′ end of DNA (known as P5 and P7 sequences, respectively; see Figure 1 A). When sequencing dsDNA, both ends of a fragment have a 5′ end. Thus, adapters will ligate to both ends but on opposite strands. In contrast, with SSDS, since the blunt-end is created from an intramolecular reaction, the fragment has only a single 5′ end. During paired-end Illumina sequencing, this adaptor orientation assures that the first read is always derived from the 5′ end of the captured ssDNA fragment. One final detail of SSDS is that hairpin processing also introduces a molecular signature of reads derived from ssDNA. This is used to computationally identify reads derived from ssDNA and to exclude those from dsDNA (see Khil et al., 2012 61. Khil, P.P. ∙ Smagulova, F. ∙ Brick, K.M. ... Sensitive mapping of recombination hotspots using sequencing-based detection of ssDNA Genome Res. 2012; 22 :957-965 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The first step of end repair was done in 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer with 10 mM ATP in the presence of dNTPs, 0.6 U T4 DNA polymerase, 0.5 U Klenow, 2 U T4 polynucleotide kinase for 30 min at 20°C. This temperature promotes the formation of hairpin loop structures. The stem of the loop is repaired in such a way that adapters can be ligated later on and importantly the polymerase-mediated fill in serves as a molecular signature for ssDNA ( Figure 1 A). The second step was done in the presence of 1 mM dATP and 1 U Klenow Exo-. Reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and DNA was purified with MinElute kit. To further enrich for ssDNA the sample was denatured for 2 min at 95°C, then cooled to room temperature. The sequencing adaptor mix (TruSeq, Illumina) was diluted 1:100 and added for the ligation step. DNA was purified by MinElute kit and amplified using the KAPA HiFi HotStart Library Amplification Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was purified with MinElute kit. Resulting libraries were sequenced with a HiSeqX in PE150 mode.
For one sample (wt_Rep2), separate libraries were made from three fractions from the sucrose gradient (Fraction 10: 800-1,000 nt, Fraction 11: 1,000-1,400 nt and Fraction 12: 1,400-2,000 nt). Sequencing data were subsequently pooled.
To validate that the Ori-SSDS enrichment stems from RNA primed leading strands, we performed experiments where we hydrolyzed the RNA prior to lambda exonuclease treatment. This also necessitated changes to the above Ori-SSDS protocol as follows. Selected fractions from the sucrose gradient were split in two tubes. In one tube, leading strand RNA primers were hydrolyzed by incubating for 30 min at 37°C in 0.25 N NaOH, followed by neutralization with acetic acid. The other tube was incubated for 30 min at 37°C but in Tris Buffer pH = 8. After neutralization, both tubes were heat denatured and spun through a Chromaspin TE-1000 size exclusion column to remove any small degradation products that could interfere with later steps. The eluate was then subjected to PNK treatment and subsequent steps outlined above. Two replicates were performed in parallel, with and without RNA hydrolysis (wt_Rep4, wt_Rep5).
Mouse ESC were obtained from Jackson labs: 129X1/SvJ-PRX-129X1 #1 mES cells derived from day 3.5 blastocysts of strain 129X1/SvJ (Stock Number 000691). The cells were cultured as recommended by Jackson labs in the presence of mitotically inactive MEF feeder cells. Exponentially growing cells were collected and 4x10 7 were used for origin detection. 8 mL of DNAzol was used for DNA extraction and then we followed the same protocol outlined for testes origin detection. For the RNase control, and aliquot of 4x10 7 was processed in parallel but before the PNK treatment, DNA was incubated with a mix of RNaseA/T and RNaseI in 1X TEN buffer (Tris 10mM pH = 8; EDTA 1mM; NaCl 100mM) for 30 min at 37°C.
Ori-SSDS in sperm was used as a negative control as there is no DNA replication. Sperm was retrieved from cauda and caput epididymides from 3 adult mice. The mix of somatic cells and sperm was resuspended in 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100 to selectively lyse somatic cells. Sperm was recovered by centrifugation and lysed in 6 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 30 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.20 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.3 M Beta-mercaptoethanol, and incubated at 55°C for 1h ( Hossain et al., 1997 52. Hossain, A.M. ∙ Rizk, B. ∙ Behzadian, A. ... Modified guanidinium thiocyanate method for human sperm DNA isolation Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3 :953-956 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of isopropyl alcohol and then spooled with a pipette tip and rinsed gently twice with EtOH 75% by sequential transfer into 15 mL tubes. DNA was air-dried for 5 min and then resuspended in 500 μL of 1X TEN buffer (Tris 10mM pH = 8; EDTA 1mM; NaCl 100mM) + 80 U of RNaseOUT (Thermo-Fisher catalog number 10777019) (40 U/μl) at 4°C for at least 24h.
Sequencing reads from Ori-SSDS experiments were aligned to the reference genome (mouse = mm10; human = hg38) using bwa 0.7.12 and the single-stranded DNA pipeline ( Brick et al., 2018a 18. Brick, K. ∙ Pratto, F. ∙ Sun, C.-Y. ... Analysis of Meiotic Double-Strand Break Initiation in Mammals Methods Enzymol. 2018; 601 :391-418 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khil et al., 2012 61. Khil, P.P. ∙ Smagulova, F. ∙ Brick, K.M. ... Sensitive mapping of recombination hotspots using sequencing-based detection of ssDNA Genome Res. 2012; 22 :957-965 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only fragments derived unambiguously from ssDNA (ssDNA_type1) were used in subsequent analyses. ssDNA fragments where either read1 or read2 had mapping quality < 30 were discarded. Fragments from the mitochondrial chromosome and fragments in blacklisted regions of the genome were also discarded. Duplicate fragments were subsequently discarded.
We used the MACS algorithm for peak calling. To assure that data derived from Ori-SSDS fit the MACS peak model, we performed two operations: 1. The strand orientation of fragments was reversed prior to peak calling. 2. The data were passed to MACS as ssDNA fragment BED files (from SSDS pipeline). Peak calling was performed for each Ori-SSDS sample using MACS 2.1.2 and the following arguments: -g (hs or mm) -q 0.001 --extsize 2000 --nomodel --nolambda.
The final origin set for mouse was defined by merging origin calls from wt_Rep1,2,3. Origin intervals overlapping by ≥ 500 bp were merged. Origin efficiency was calculated in each sample using a method analogous to that for DMC1-SSDS hotspot mapping ( Brick et al., 2018a 18. Brick, K. ∙ Pratto, F. ∙ Sun, C.-Y. ... Analysis of Meiotic Double-Strand Break Initiation in Mammals Methods Enzymol. 2018; 601 :391-418 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, each origin is re-centered to the midpoint of the Watson and Crick fragment distributions. Signal is estimated as the Crick-strand signal to the left of the origin center + the Watson-strand signal to the right of the origin center. The background is estimated by counting the remaining fragments at the left and right edges of MACS-defined origins (15%); Watson-strand fragments to the left of the origin center, Crick-strand fragments to the right. This background is then extrapolated to the entire origin and subtracted from the signal. Following this process, origins found in just one sample and origins that did not display the expected Crick/Watson asymmetry ( Figure 1 A) in any sample were discarded.
CpG dinucleotide density was evaluated in all 1 Kb regions in the genome using a 100 bp sliding window. Intervals with > 5% CpGs were expanded ± 100 bp around the center and overlapping windows were merged. The centerpoint of each merged interval was defined as a CpG “peak.”
Nuclei from mouse or human testes were prepared as described in Lam et al. (2019) 68. Lam, K.G. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Cheng, G. ... Cell-type-specific genomics reveals histone modification dynamics in mammalian meiosis Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3821 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar . For experiments with mouse we used between 2 to 6 testes per sort. For humans we used ∼200 mg of tissue. To purify the populations of interest, a combination of intranuclear markers were used ( Table S1 ; Figure 3 ). The following markers were used: • STRA8 is required for meiotic entry ( Anderson et al., 2008 3. Anderson, E.L. ∙ Baltus, A.E. ∙ Roepers-Gajadien, H.L. ... Stra8 and its inducer, retinoic acid, regulate meiotic initiation in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :14976-14980 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is expressed at low levels in a subset of spermatogonia and expression increases upon meiotic entry ( Green et al., 2018 43. Green, C.D. ∙ Ma, Q. ∙ Manske, G.L. ...

STRA8 levels are very low in human compared to mouse, therefore we use other markers (HORMAD1 and SYCP3) • DMRT1 is required to regulate meiotic entry ( Matson et al., 2010 81.

Each population was visually inspected for purity. The meiotic populations are notably high purity ( Figure 3 D). Assessing the purity of spermatogonia substages is challenging. Undifferentiated and intermediate stage spermatogonia populations ( Figure 3 C) are reproducibly of high purity. The Spermatogonia B population ( Figure 3 C) exhibited varying degrees of purity across experiments. A majority of these nuclei are Spermatogonia B, however some A-type spermatogonia are also captured by this gating strategy.
All antibodies are listed in the Key resources table . To raise custom polyclonal antibodies against REC8, a peptide (AEDEKSRTSLIPPEWWAWSEEGQPEPP) from mouse REC8 was synthesized and was used to immunize two rabbits (NeoScientific, Cambridge, MA). The immobilized peptide was subsequently used for affinity purification of REC8 antibodies from the rabbit serum.
To assess the identity of replicating cells from whole testes, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100-200 μg of 5-ethynyl-2`-deoxyuridine (EdU, a thymidine analog) in PBS and mouse testes were harvested at 30 min after injection. We then combined the same sorting strategy we used to isolate MeiS nuclei ( Table S1 ) plus the EdU detection for quantification.
Nuclei were concentrated in a small volume after centrifugation. The nuclei suspension was then pipetted onto silane coated slides and mounted with Vectashield.
Exponentially growing mouse ES-cells were cross-linked by adding fresh 1% paraformaldehyde solution to the ES media for 10 minutes at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with 1X PBS and scraped off the plates, pelleted and nuclei were prepared as described in Lam et al. (2019) 68. Lam, K.G. ∙ Brick, K. ∙ Cheng, G. ... Cell-type-specific genomics reveals histone modification dynamics in mammalian meiosis Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3821 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar . Replicating cells were sorted based DNA content.
Pure nuclei populations were resuspended in 300 ul of lysis buffer (SDS 1%, 10mM EDTA, 50mM Tris pH = 8) and then sonicated in a Bioruptor UCD200 for 20 min 30 s ON 30 s OFF, “high” setting. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.2M and the sample incubated overnight at 65°C to reverse DNA-protein crosslinks. 5U of Proteinase K) was added and the sample further incubated for 1h at 45°C. DNA was purified with MinElute columns (QIAGEN), as indicated by the instruction manual. Whole-genome sequencing libraries were prepared from 100 ng of purified DNA using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (20605) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to align each WGS dataset to the reference genome (mm10 for mouse; hg38 for human). WGS from a non-replicating population was used to calibrate the expected GC-biases from different sequencing instruments (Illumina HiSeq 2000, Illumina HiSeq 2500, Illumina HiSeq X, Illumina NextSeq 500). Briefly, these calibration files were generated by examining a subset of perfectly mappable genomic loci. Each locus is a 101 bp region with the following properties: 1. Full mappability of all bases within the 101 bp window. To determine mappability, we generated a fastq file of pseudoreads of the requisite length from the reference genome fasta file. One pseudo-read was generated per bp; all bases were assigned a q-score of 60. Pseudo-reads were mapped to the reference genome using bwa mem 0.7.12 and the coverage at each base in the genome was assessed. 2. The window does not overlap with sequencing gaps (UCSC Gaps track), segmental duplications (UCSC SegDups track), high copy repeats (UCSC repeatmasker track) or otherwise blacklisted genomic regions ( Amemiya et al., 2019 2.

The human genome browser at UCSC Genome Res. 2002; 12 :996-1006 Crossref Scopus (5831) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The samples used to generate GC-correction files were the 2C MMC and 2C HSC samples ( Table S1 ) for Hi-Seq X and Hi-Seq 2500, respectively. Samples used to generate GC-correction files for published data are detailed in Table S2 below.
The GC content (rounded to 1%) and WGS sequencing coverage of each 101 bp window was assessed. The median coverage for all windows of a given GC content was used as a correction factor. These correction factors vary substantially across the different sequencing platforms used. 2% of all qualifying 101 bp autosomal windows were used to calculate the GC correction coefficients.
For each RT-Seq experiment, the WGS coverage in 101-bp windows in the genome was calculated and corrected for GC biases using the correction coefficient for the appropriate sequencing platform. Replication timing was calculated as the log 2 ratio of corrected sequencing coverage at a locus to the genome-wide median (method was adapted from ( Koren et al., 2014 66. Koren, A. ∙ Handsaker, R.E. ∙ Kamitaki, N. ... Genetic variation in human DNA replication timing Cell. 2014; 159 :1015-1026 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar )). RT-Seq coverage was smoothed in 500 Kb windows with a 50 Kb step.
Whole-genome sequencing data were obtained from the sources listed in Table S2 . Sequencing data were aligned and replication timing profiles were inferred as described above.
DNA replication was modeled in-silico using custom R code (see Data and code availability ). Replication was simulated in a haploid genome. Non-autosomal chromosomes were excluded. The initial wave of origin firing was assumed to be synchronous. k replication origins were selected at random and without replacement, using the origin efficiency as a selection weight. At each origin, a left-ward and a right-ward replication fork was established, and replication was then simulated bi-directionally outward from each origin in 10 Kb steps. After each step, we assessed which replication forks have collided with another fork and which forks reached the end of the chromosome. These forks were terminated. For every two terminated forks, we allowed replication to begin from a new, randomly chosen origin (as above, weighted by origin efficiency). Origins that have previously fired and origins in regions that have already been replicated were not considered for selection. This iterative process continued until the genome was fully replicated or for a defined number of cycles. To simulate replication in a population, this simulation was performed in n haploid genomes and the results were combined.
To assess the best-fitting parameters of DNA replication in-silico , we performed a grid-hyperparameter search. A hyperparameter search was performed for each pairwise combination of RT and replication origins. We optimized for a scoring function defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the experimentally-determined replication timing and the in-silico simulated replication timing. A population of 250 replicating haploid genomes was used for the hyperparameter search. The grid-search generated an RT-Sim model for each combination of the following parameters: a. Origin density; R d = 0.02 to 0.4 in 0.01 steps; 0.45 to 0.6 in 0.05 steps b. Modeling runtime; N epochs = 10 to 7500 in steps of 10 c. Replicating cells in population; P (%) = 10,30,50,70,90 d. Use origin efficiency; E = TRUE / FALSE (if FALSE, all origins were equally weighted for “random” selection)
The fine-grained search yielded multiple models with similar scores, therefore in assessing results, the top 0.015% of models were examined.
The hyperparameters of the top-scoring RT-Sim model were used to generate an RT-Sim model from 500 haploid genomes and run it to completion. Simulated replication timing was then defined as the mean replication time across all simulations for each 10 Kb window in the genome.
