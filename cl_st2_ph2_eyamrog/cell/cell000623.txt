Title: BacPROTACs mediate targeted protein degradation in bacteria


Abstract: Summary

Hijacking the cellular protein degradation system offers unique opportunities for drug discovery, as exemplified by proteolysis-targeting chimeras. Despite their great promise for medical chemistry, so far, it has not been possible to reprogram the bacterial degradation machinery to interfere with microbial infections. Here, we develop small-molecule degraders, so-called BacPROTACs, that bind to the substrate receptor of the ClpC:ClpP protease, priming neo-substrates for degradation. In addition to their targeting function, BacPROTACs activate ClpC, transforming the resting unfoldase into its functional state. The induced higher-order oligomer was visualized by cryo-EM analysis, providing a structural snapshot of activated ClpC unfolding a protein substrate. Finally, drug susceptibility and degradation assays performed in mycobacteria demonstrate in vivo activity of BacPROTACs, allowing selective targeting of endogenous proteins via fusion to an established degron. In addition to guiding antibiotic discovery, the BacPROTAC technology presents a versatile research tool enabling the inducible degradation of bacterial proteins.

Section: Introduction

Technological advances in proteomics, chemical biology, and high-throughput screening campaigns have boosted drug discovery across therapeutic areas. Unfortunately, however, these advances have thus far not equally translated into the development of novel antibacterial agents ( Lewis, 2020 39. Lewis, K. The science of antibiotic discovery Cell. 2020; 181 :29-45 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ; Payne et al., 2007 55. Payne, D.J. ∙ Gwynn, M.N. ∙ Holmes, D.J. ...

Why big pharma has abandoned antibiotics Nature. 2020; 586 :S50-S52 Crossref Google Scholar ; Tommasi et al., 2015 74. Tommasi, R. ∙ Brown, D.G. ∙ Walkup, G.K. ... ESKAPEing the labyrinth of antibacterial discovery Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015; 14 :529-542 Crossref Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar ). This discrepancy is most obvious when considering the small number of antibiotics that have been discovered in the last 50 years ( Lewis, 2020 39. Lewis, K. The science of antibiotic discovery Cell. 2020; 181 :29-45 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Beyond economic hurdles, the advancement of new antibiotics is challenged by the low permeability of the bacterial envelope, and the limited number of microbial proteins that can be specifically inhibited without off-target effects. The difficulties in finding effective antimicrobials are further compounded by the speed at which pathogens are developing resistance to existing drugs. In light of this unequal arms race, the return of bacterial pandemics is a real threat, and innovative strategies to combat infections are urgently needed ( Lewis, 2020 39. Lewis, K. The science of antibiotic discovery Cell. 2020; 181 :29-45 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ).
An emerging concept in drug discovery is the induced elimination of target proteins. Engineered chemicals can now interfere with various degradation pathways, redirecting the lysosomal ( Banik et al., 2020 2. Banik, S.M. ∙ Pedram, K. ∙ Wisnovsky, S. ... Lysosome-targeting chimaeras for degradation of extracellular proteins Nature. 2020; 584 :291-297 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar ), the autophagy ( Li et al., 2019 40. Li, Z. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Wang, Z. ... Allele-selective lowering of mutant HTT protein by HTT-LC3 linker compounds Nature. 2019; 575 :203-209 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ; Takahashi et al., 2019 73.

Cell. 2019; 76 :797-810.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ), or the ubiquitin-proteasome systems ( Sakamoto et al., 2001 65. Sakamoto, K.M. ∙ Kim, K.B. ∙ Kumagai, A. ... Protacs: chimeric molecules that target proteins to the Skp1-cullin-F box complex for ubiquitination and degradation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :8554-8559 Crossref Scopus (1472) PubMed Google Scholar ) to target specified proteins. The most prominent synthetic “degraders” are the proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs): bi-functional small molecules that contain a binding head for an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a chemical moiety to engage a protein of interest (POI) ( Sakamoto et al., 2001 65. Sakamoto, K.M. ∙ Kim, K.B. ∙ Kumagai, A. ... Protacs: chimeric molecules that target proteins to the Skp1-cullin-F box complex for ubiquitination and degradation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :8554-8559 Crossref Scopus (1472) PubMed Google Scholar ). By bringing the E3 ligase and POI into proximity, PROTACs promote POI ubiquitination and consequent degradation by the proteasome. Protein degraders have various advantages over classical inhibitors. For example, they exhibit higher efficacy due to their catalytic mode of action. Moreover, they allow targeting of virtually any cellular protein and their modular architecture allows protein ligands to be repurposed to build degraders ( Churcher, 2018 11. Churcher, I. Protac-induced protein degradation in drug discovery: breaking the rules or just making new ones? J. Med. Chem. 2018; 61 :444-452 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hanzl and Winter, 2020 29. Hanzl, A. ∙ Winter, G.E. Targeted protein degradation: current and future challenges Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2020; 56 :35-41 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schapira et al., 2019 67. Schapira, M. ∙ Calabrese, M.F. ∙ Bullock, A.N. ... Targeted protein degradation: expanding the toolbox Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18 :949-963 Crossref Scopus (512) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite this promise, PROTAC technology is so far restricted to the ubiquitin tagging system of eukaryotes and has yet to be transferred to degradation pathways in bacteria. Fulfilling this last objective would provide an attractive strategy to design modulators of protein function and a platform for antibiotics discovery.
Although ubiquitin is unique to eukaryotic cells, some bacteria utilize a similar system for targeted protein degradation. Phosphorylated arginine residues (pArg) serve as a degradation signal that is recognized by the ClpC:ClpP (ClpCP) protease, a quasi-proteasomal particle critical for microbial protein quality control, stress tolerance, and pathogenicity ( Trentini et al., 2016 75. Trentini, D.B. ∙ Suskiewicz, M.J. ∙ Heuck, A. ... Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease Nature. 2016; 539 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). ClpCP is present in gram-positive bacteria and in mycobacteria. In the latter, the equivalent ClpC1P1P2 protease is essential for survival in vitro and in macrophages ( DeJesus et al., 2017 14. DeJesus, M.A. ∙ Gerrick, E.R. ∙ Xu, W. ... Comprehensive essentiality analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome via saturating transposon mutagenesis mBio. 2017; 8 e02133–16 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rengarajan et al., 2005 62. Rengarajan, J. ∙ Bloom, B.R. ∙ Rubin, E.J. Genome-wide requirements for Mycobacterium tuberculosis adaptation and survival in macrophages Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102 :8327-8332 Crossref Scopus (582) PubMed Google Scholar ). ClpC carries out its quality control function by acting as an ATP-driven unfoldase that selects certain client proteins and translocates them into the protease compartment formed by ClpP. The ClpC protomer contains an amino-terminal domain (ClpC NTD ), two AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) domains termed D1 and D2, and a coiled coil (M domain) inserted into D1. In the active ClpC hexamer, the D1 and D2 domains form two stacked ATPase rings that power substrate unfolding and translocation. The ClpC NTD on top of the D1 ring controls access to the unfoldase, providing docking sites for adaptor proteins including MecA ( Schlothauer et al., 2003 68. Schlothauer, T. ∙ Mogk, A. ∙ Dougan, D.A. ... MecA, an adaptor protein necessary for ClpC chaperone activity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :2306-2311 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2011 79. Wang, F. ∙ Mei, Z. ∙ Qi, Y. ... Structure and mechanism of the hexameric MecA-ClpC molecular machine Nature. 2011; 471 :331-335 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the ClpC NTD receptor domain recognizes pArg-tagged substrates that account for ∼30% of the whole ClpP degradome in gram-positive bacteria ( Trentini et al., 2016 75. Trentini, D.B. ∙ Suskiewicz, M.J. ∙ Heuck, A. ... Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease Nature. 2016; 539 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared with the eukaryotic proteasome, which recognizes a complex poly-ubiquitin signal, the degradation signal recognized by ClpCP is much simpler: a plain phosphate group attached to an arginine residue of the client protein ( Trentini et al., 2016 75. Trentini, D.B. ∙ Suskiewicz, M.J. ∙ Heuck, A. ... Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease Nature. 2016; 539 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we investigated whether the ClpCP degradation machine can be directly reprogrammed by small molecules. We reasoned that bi-functional adaptors could tether neo-substrates to the ClpC NTD receptor domain, priming them for degradation ( Figure 1 A). Our results provide a proof of concept that such BacPROTACs can be developed and are active in vivo , enabling the inducible, selective, and efficient degradation of target proteins in bacteria.

Section: Results

To enable ClpC-mediated protein degradation, we designed BacPROTACs composed of a POI ligand, a chemical linker and a ClpC NTD anchor. The anchor initially consisted of a peptidic pArg derivative mimicking the bacterial degradation tag. In order to test the targeting of a neo-substrate, we used monomeric streptavidin (mSA) as a model protein. We synthesized BacPROTAC-1 ( Figure 1 B), connecting the pArg moiety to biotin, a high affinity mSA ligand ( Lim et al., 2013 42. Lim, K.H. ∙ Huang, H. ∙ Pralle, A. ... Stable, high-affinity streptavidin monomer for protein labeling and monovalent biotin detection Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110 :57-67 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). The linker attachment points were designed based on high-resolution crystal structures of pArg:ClpC NTD ( Trentini et al., 2016 75. Trentini, D.B. ∙ Suskiewicz, M.J. ∙ Heuck, A. ... Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease Nature. 2016; 539 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ) and biotin:mSA ( Demonte et al., 2013 15. Demonte, D. ∙ Drake, E.J. ∙ Lim, K.H. ... Structure-based engineering of streptavidin monomer with a reduced biotin dissociation rate Proteins. 2013; 81 :1621-1633 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements confirmed that BacPROTAC-1 binds mSA and ClpC NTD with high affinity (K D s of 3.9 and 2.8 μM; Figures 1 C and 1D), whereas analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) runs revealed the formation of a stable ternary complex ( Figure 1 E). To analyze whether the induced spatial proximity is sufficient to trigger degradation, we reconstituted the Bacillus subtilis ClpCP protease in vitro and monitored mSA digestion at different BacPROTAC concentrations. Incubation with 100 μM BacPROTAC-1 led to selective mSA depletion ( Figure 1 F), indicating that the bacterial ClpCP can be reprogrammed by a pArg-containing chemical adaptor. Notably, however, efficient degradation was only observed at concentrations that were higher than the measured affinities among individual components. This discrepancy likely reflects distinct requirements for substrate recruitment and translocation processes carried out by the ClpC unfoldase.
To follow up on this and analyze the influence of substrate-specific properties on ClpCP activity, we cloned various mSA fusion proteins. We selected four B. subtilis targets that have been identified as physiological, pArg-labeled ClpCP substrates ( Trentini et al., 2016 75. Trentini, D.B. ∙ Suskiewicz, M.J. ∙ Heuck, A. ... Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease Nature. 2016; 539 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the aim of finding favorable structural features facilitating degradation. Three of these proteins (NrdI, TagD, and NusA) adopt rather compact protein folds, whereas Kre is predicted to possess a 28-amino acid long unstructured C-terminal tail ( Figure S1 A). Biochemical assays, monitoring the BacPROTAC-1 dependent degradation of the four mSA fusion proteins by ClpCP, revealed pronounced differences ( Figures 1 G and 1H). mSA-Kre was by far the best substrate, being degraded by 1 μM BacPROTAC-1. These data indicated that, beyond BacPROTAC affinities, structural features of recruited neo-substrates significantly affect degradation efficiency. Consistent with the reported ClpCP preference for proteins having intrinsically disordered termini ( Lunge et al., 2020 45. Lunge, A. ∙ Gupta, R. ∙ Choudhary, E. ... The unfoldase ClpC1 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis regulates the expression of a distinct subset of proteins having intrinsically disordered termini J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 :9455-9473 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), the efficient degradation of mSA-Kre may relate to its unstructured C-terminal stretch, functioning as initiator site for substrate unfolding and translocation. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the functionally related 26S proteasome, which requires an unstructured region to efficiently degrade ubiquitinated proteins ( Bard et al., 2019 5. Bard, J.A.M. ∙ Bashore, C. ∙ Dong, K.C. ... The 26S proteasome utilizes a kinetic gateway to prioritize substrate degradation Cell. 2019; 177 :286-298.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Inobe et al., 2011 31. Inobe, T. ∙ Fishbain, S. ∙ Prakash, S. ... Defining the geometry of the two-component proteasome degron Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7 :161-167 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ; Prakash et al., 2004 59. Prakash, S. ∙ Tian, L. ∙ Ratliff, K.S. ... An unstructured initiation site is required for efficient proteasome-mediated degradation Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11 :830-837 Crossref Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ). To confirm that degradation is specifically induced by BacPROTAC-1, we hindered substrate recruitment by adding the isolated binding moieties pArg or biotin to the reaction ( Figure 1 H). In the presence of these compounds, mSA-Kre was not digested by ClpCP, confirming that BacPROTAC-mediated ternary complex formation is essential for degradation. Likewise, a degrader impaired in binding to ClpC (BacPROTAC-1c, containing a non-phosphorylated arginine residue) did not induce substrate degradation ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Finally, we investigated the impact of linker design on degrading efficiency, a parameter shown to influence the activity of bi-functional PROTACs, defining E3 ligase-substrate interactions ( Churcher, 2018 11. Churcher, I. Protac-induced protein degradation in drug discovery: breaking the rules or just making new ones? J. Med. Chem. 2018; 61 :444-452 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus synthesized two additional analogs containing shorter chemical spacers between the pArg and biotin moieties (BacPROTAC-1a and -1b; Figure S1 B). However, degradation efficiency was not significantly influenced ( Figure S1 C), suggesting that linker length is not as relevant for ClpCP to engage with neo-substrates.
Taken together, our results show that pArg-containing BacPROTACs can recruit POIs to the ClpC NTD domain and promote their degradation by the ClpCP protease. In addition to the binding characteristics of the chemical adaptor, intrinsic properties of target proteins seem to play an equally important role in determining degradation efficiency.
Housekeeping proteases and chaperones that target aberrant proteins need to be carefully controlled to prevent concomitant damage to functional proteins in the cell. A study addressing the regulation of the Staphylococcus aureus ClpC, a close relative to the B. subtilis unfoldase, revealed the existence of a ClpC resting state, a decamer with disrupted AAA rings ( Carroni et al., 2017 10. Carroni, M. ∙ Franke, K.B. ∙ Maurer, M. ... Regulatory coiled-coil domains promote head-to-head assemblies of AAA+ chaperones essential for tunable activity control eLife. 2017; 6 :e30120 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interaction with the adaptor protein MecA destabilizes the decamer and promotes assembly of the functional hexamer with an active arrangement of ATPase units ( Carroni et al., 2017 10. Carroni, M. ∙ Franke, K.B. ∙ Maurer, M. ... Regulatory coiled-coil domains promote head-to-head assemblies of AAA+ chaperones essential for tunable activity control eLife. 2017; 6 :e30120 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to adaptor-mediated activation, it is unclear how the majority of ClpC substrates labeled with pArg trigger remodeling of the latent ClpC decamer. To elucidate this general activation mechanism—and more specifically, the way in which it is mimicked by a pArg-based degrader—we performed a structural analysis of ClpC in complex with BacPROTAC-1 and the mSA-Kre fusion protein. To stabilize ATP-mediated contacts between ClpC protomers, we used a catalytically inactive mutant (E280A/E618A, referred to as ClpC DWB ) that binds ATP but does not hydrolyze it. When we added ClpC DWB and mSA-Kre in stoichiometric amounts to a SEC column, ClpC DWB and mSA-Kre eluted separately ( Figure 2 A). Similar to the S. aureus protein, isolated B. subtilis ClpC DWB was present in its resting state, the decamer, as visualized by negative-staining EM ( Figures 2 B and S2 A). Incubation with BacPROTAC-1 led to the co-elution of mSA and ClpC DWB , pointing to the formation of a stable ternary complex. To our surprise, however, the estimated size of the BacPROTAC-induced complex was far from compatible with the predicted size of substrate-bound ClpC DWB hexamer ( Figure 2 A). Instead, the resulting complex eluted as a higher-order ClpC oligomer with a molecular mass beyond 2 MDa. EM analysis of the substrate engaged ClpC revealed the formation of a tetramer of ClpC hexamers, arranged in almost perfect tetrahedral symmetry ( Figures 2 C and S2 B). Tetramer formation did not result from residual tetramerization propensity of the mSA-Kre substrate, as partial conversion into this active state was also observed in the presence of BacPROTAC-1 alone ( Figures S2 D and S2E). A similar quaternary arrangement has been reported for a chimeric ClpC ( M. tuberculosis ClpC1 NTD fused to S. aureus D1-D2 AAA core) incubated with the antibiotic cyclomarin A (CymA) ( Maurer et al., 2019 47. Maurer, M. ∙ Linder, D. ∙ Franke, K.B. ... Toxic activation of an AAA+ protease by the antibacterial drug cyclomarin A Cell Chem. Biol. 2019; 26 :1169-1179.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in that case, 2D class averages of negative-stained EM images could not reveal structural details of the tetrahedral assembly. BacPROTAC-tethered mSA-Kre, which mimics a trapped substrate, yielded seemingly better-defined particles of the activated state. Cryo-EM analysis visualized the overall organization of the higher-order ClpC unfoldase complex at 10 Å resolution ( Figure 2 D; Table 1 ). In this state, the D2 rings of the four ClpC hexamers project outward such that they can interact with the ClpP protease. The substrate-bound ClpC NTD domains are located in the center of the particle but are too flexible to be defined by EM density. Most strikingly, the four ClpC hexamers interact with each other via their coiled-coil M domains, establishing a net of helix pairs holding the particle together ( Figure 2 D). As the M domains are known to stabilize the resting state of ClpC ( Carroni et al., 2017 10. Carroni, M. ∙ Franke, K.B. ∙ Maurer, M. ... Regulatory coiled-coil domains promote head-to-head assemblies of AAA+ chaperones essential for tunable activity control eLife. 2017; 6 :e30120 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), their BacPROTAC-induced reorientation might disassemble the latent form and promote formation of active hexamers stabilized within a supramolecular assembly ( Figure 2 E). To validate the functional relevance of the remodeled ClpC complex, we analyzed ClpC oligomers in the presence of an arginine-phosphorylated substrate. To this end, we phosphorylated beta-casein by the McsB kinase and incubated the isolated pArg-casein with ClpC. Binding of pArg-casein transformed the ClpC decamer into higher-order complexes, most of which were present as tetrahedral oligomers, visualized by negative-stained EM analysis ( Figures S2 F and S2G). These data unveil a distinct mechanism of regulating AAA ATPase function. Labeled substrates bind to ClpC, remodeling the resting decamer into an active higher-order complex. This mechanism that directly couples substrate binding with unfoldase activation can be hijacked by BacPROTACs allowing delivery of neo-substrates to ClpC.
To assess whether the reassembled ClpC contributes to proteolysis, we analyzed complex formation with the double-ring protease ClpP. Notably, mixing equimolar amounts of ClpP and ClpC in the presence of BacPROTAC led to protein precipitation, presumably reflecting the formation of an extended, mesh-like assembly that results from multivalent interactions between ClpC and ClpP particles ( Figure 2 F). We therefore used sub-stoichiometric amounts of ClpP to visualize ClpCP complexes. Addition of BacPROTAC-1 induced formation of defined 5-MDa particles that could be resolved by negative-stained EM ( Figure S2 C). The 2D class averages illustrate the structural organization of a giant ClpC 24 -ClpP 14 -ClpC 24 complex, in which tetrahedral ClpC oligomers bind to both sides of the ClpP protease ( Figure 2 G). These structural data also confirm that the BacPROTAC-induced oligomer is an active ClpC state, composed of functional hexamers poised to interact with the ClpP protease.
To resolve the functional units of the activated unfoldase at higher resolution, we performed a focused cryo-EM analysis of the single hexamers ( Figure 3 A). The resulting 3D map had an overall resolution of 3.7 Å ( Figures S3 A–S3C; Table 1 ) and allowed us to build an atomic model of the substrate-bound ClpC complex ( Figure 3 ; Video S1 ). The most prominent feature of the cryo-EM reconstruction is a well-defined, 80-Å-long density that penetrates the entire ClpC pore, proceeding from the top of the D1 to the bottom of the D2 ring ( Figure 3 B). Although it is not possible to discern side chains, the density should represent the protein backbone of the captured mSA-Kre substrate, comprising 26 residues present in an extended conformation. The six ClpC subunits adopt a spiral arrangement, engaging the substrate in a similar manner to that observed in the related double-ring AAA unfoldases ClpA, ClpB, and Hsp104 ( Gates et al., 2017 24. Gates, S.N. ∙ Yokom, A.L. ∙ Lin, J. ... Ratchet-like polypeptide translocation mechanism of the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104 Science. 2017; 357 :273-279 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lopez et al., 2020 44.

Structural basis for substrate gripping and translocation by the ClpB AAA+ disaggregase Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2393 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). Five ClpC protomers (P1–P5, P1 as lowermost and P5 uppermost unit in the AAA ring) interact with the substrate through conserved tyrosine-bearing pore loops in the D1 and D2 domains, while the “seam” protomer (P6) is detached from the substrate, transitioning from the bottom to the top position of the spiral ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Nucleotide states were assigned on the basis of the EM density and the position of the so-called arginine fingers from the neighboring subunit ( Figure S3 D). Accordingly, the D1 and D2 ATPase rings act in a closely coordinated manner to translocate substrates through the central pore. In both rings, the substrate-engaging P2–P5 protomers are present in an ATP-bound state (except P2-D2), whereas protomers P1 and P6 accommodate ADP or are present in an apo state. These structural data are consistent with the previously suggested “hand-over-hand” translocation mechanism ( Puchades et al., 2020 60. Puchades, C. ∙ Sandate, C.R. ∙ Lander, G.C. The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :43-58 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), according to which nucleotide exchange is coupled with substrate release and upward movement of the seam protomer P6 to rebind ATP and substrate ( Figure 3 E). By reorienting in a concerted manner, the ClpC protomers move stepwise from one end of the spiral to the other, dragging the captured substrate down the central channel ( Puchades et al., 2020 60. Puchades, C. ∙ Sandate, C.R. ∙ Lander, G.C. The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :43-58 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cycles of substrate binding, translocation, and release are driven by ATP hydrolysis at the lowermost P1 protomer of the spiral. In conclusion, the cryo-EM structure of the reconstituted ternary complex provides a snapshot of ClpC in the process of unfolding a BacPROTAC-tethered substrate. The structure of the ClpC 24-mer indicates that the pArg mark serves not only as a degradation signal but also mediates higher-order oligomer formation and activation of ClpC. The developed BacPROTAC containing a pArg moiety triggers this remodeling mechanism and thus functions not only as a chemical adaptor but also as an activator of the ClpCP protease.

Cryo-EM structure of activated ClpC in complex with substrate, related to Figure 3 The video shows the map of the tetramer of ClpC hexamers (10 Å) and the map obtained refining a single ClpC hexamer (3.7 Å). Both maps are colored by ClpC protomer. Continuous density is observed for a substrate peptide (colored yellow) along the ClpC channel, surrounded by Tyr-containing pore loops, as described in the main text.
The above biochemical and structural data revealed that pArg-based BacPROTACs can reprogram the ClpCP system of B. subtilis . To examine the therapeutic potential of the developed degrader, we aimed to transfer our approach to mycobacteria, which are among the most widely spread and dangerous human pathogens ( WHO, 2021 81. WHO ∙ G.T.P. Global tuberculosis report 2021 2021 Google Scholar ). Although a pArg-dependent degradation pathway has not been identified in mycobacteria, the substrate receptor of the ClpC1P1P2 protease has a bona fide and functional pArg receptor site, with all residues involved in phospho-guanidinium binding being fully conserved in its ClpC1 NTD domain ( Weinhäupl et al., 2018 80. Weinhäupl, K. ∙ Brennich, M. ∙ Kazmaier, U. ... The antibiotic cyclomarin blocks arginine-phosphate-induced millisecond dynamics in the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :8379-8393 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test if pArg-based BacPROTACs can reprogram the mycobacterial degradation machinery, we analyzed the Mycobacterium smegmatis ClpC1 system. ITC and SEC experiments revealed that BacPROTAC-1 binds to ClpC1 NTD with high affinity (K D = 0.69 μM) and promotes ternary complex formation with mSA and ClpC1 NTD ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Using the reconstituted ClpC1P1P2 protease, we observed that BacPROTAC-1 induces the degradation of a mSA substrate in a highly selective and efficient manner ( Figure 4 A). These data demonstrate that pArg-containing degraders can reprogram the ClpC1P1P2 protease of mycobacteria.
A major limitation in advancing pArg-based PROTACs is their poor pharmacokinetic profile and the chemical instability of the phospho-guanidinium group ( Schmidt et al., 2014 69. Schmidt, A. ∙ Trentini, D.B. ∙ Spiess, S. ... Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals the role of protein arginine phosphorylation in the bacterial stress response Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2014; 13 :537-550 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). To overcome these limitations, we looked for chemical entities that could replace pArg. Of note, the mycobacterial ClpC1 is targeted by a range of cyclic peptides that deregulate the ClpC1P1P2 complex ( Lee and Suh, 2016 37. Lee, H. ∙ Suh, J.W. Anti-tuberculosis lead molecules from natural products targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis ClpC1 J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2016; 43 :205-212 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). These antibiotics bind to the ClpC1 NTD substrate receptor domain and thus have a pArg-like targeting function. The best characterized ClpC1 NTD -directed antibiotic is CymA ( Vasudevan et al., 2013 77. Vasudevan, D. ∙ Rao, S.P. ∙ Noble, C.G. Structural basis of mycobacterial inhibition by cyclomarin A J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :30883-30891 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ), which binds to a hydrophobic pocket located in a remote position relative to the pArg-binding sites ( Figures 4 B and 4C). The CymA binding pocket is highly conserved in ClpC1 unfoldases, but is absent in ClpC proteins from gram-positive bacteria, enabling selective targeting of the mycobacterial protease. Moreover, CymA can pass the cell envelope of mycobacteria ( Schmitt et al., 2011 70. Schmitt, E.K. ∙ Riwanto, M. ∙ Sambandamurthy, V. ... The natural product cyclomarin kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ClpC1 subunit of the caseinolytic protease Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50 :5889-5891 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thus represents a building block with important properties to explore the activity of small-molecule degraders in bacterial cells.
To prepare CymA-based degraders, we developed a solid-phase synthesis approach providing the 7-residue cyclic peptide in large quantities. To facilitate the de novo synthesis of the natural compound ( Barbie and Kazmaier, 2016 4. Barbie, P. ∙ Kazmaier, U. Total synthesis of cyclomarin A, a marine cycloheptapeptide with anti-tuberculosis and anti-malaria activity Org. Lett. 2016; 18 :204-207 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), we replaced certain non-proteinogenic amino acids with chemically simpler analogs. Guided by structural data ( Vasudevan et al., 2013 77. Vasudevan, D. ∙ Rao, S.P. ∙ Noble, C.G. Structural basis of mycobacterial inhibition by cyclomarin A J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :30883-30891 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ), we prepared a series of CymA-like cyclic peptides and identified sCym-1 as a high affinity ClpC1 NTD ligand (K D = 0.81 μM; Figures 4 C and S4 C). A co-crystal structure obtained at 1.7 Å resolution ( Figure 4 D; Table S1 ) confirmed that the sCym-1 mimetic adopts the same binding mode as the native CymA antibiotic. Moreover, the crystal structure revealed a possible linker attachment site to synthesize BacPROTAC-2, in which sCym-1 is linked to biotin ( Figure 4 E). When tested in our biochemical assay, the sCym-1-based degrader stimulated removal of the mSA model substrate to similar extents as its pArg counterpart ( Figures 4 F, S4 D, and S4E), indicating that derivatives of the CymA antibiotic can be repurposed as BacPROTAC components. Importantly, these data also show that various ClpC1 NTD binders can be exploited to develop chemical adaptors for targeted protein degradation. To further demonstrate that the system is generalizable, and since cellular biotin would compete for binding to mSA and impede BacPROTAC activity ( Figure 4 F), we looked for an alternative POI and identified the bromodomain-1 (BD1) of BRDT as attractive model substrate. BRDT BD1 (residues 21–137) encodes a soluble protein that binds with high affinity to BET bromodomain inhibitors ( Matzuk et al., 2012 46. Matzuk, M.M. ∙ McKeown, M.R. ∙ Filippakopoulos, P. ... Small-molecule inhibition of BRDT for male contraception Cell. 2012; 150 :673-684 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ). One of its small-molecule ligands, JQ1, has been widely used in various PROTACs ( Winter et al., 2015 83. Winter, G.E. ∙ Buckley, D.L. ∙ Paulk, J. ... Drug development. Phthalimide conjugation as a strategy for in vivo target protein degradation Science. 2015; 348 :1376-1381 Crossref Scopus (1202) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zengerle et al., 2015 84. Zengerle, M. ∙ Chan, K.H. ∙ Ciulli, A. Selective small molecule induced degradation of the BET bromodomain protein BRD4 ACS Chem. Biol. 2015; 10 :1770-1777 Crossref Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus facilitating the rational design of bacterial degraders. Moreover, BRDT is a human protein with no bacterial homologues, allowing selective in vivo degradation without interfering with endogenous pathways. To target BRDT BD1 , we synthesized BacPROTAC-3 linking sCym-1 and JQ1 ( Figure 4 G). The degrader was able to recruit BRDT BD1 ( Figures S4 F–S4H) and induce its degradation by ClpC1P1P2 in a highly specific manner ( Figure 4 H). Additionally, we synthesized BacPROTAC-3a incorporating the JQ1( R ) enantiomer ( Figure S4 I) that displays a 60-fold lower affinity toward BRDT BD1 than the eutomer JQ1( S ) ( Filippakopoulos et al., 2010 22. Filippakopoulos, P. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Picaud, S. ... Selective inhibition of BET bromodomains Nature. 2010; 468 :1067-1073 Crossref Scopus (3237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Application of BacPROTAC-3a in biochemical assays showed strongly compromised degradation efficiency, consistent with its reduced binding affinity ( Figure 4 H).
Having shown that sCym-1 can be successfully incorporated into distinct bi-functional degraders, we extended the approach to a slightly modified derivative of the natural cyclomarin, dCymM ( Figure 4 C). Due to the technically demanding synthesis of dCymM ( Kiefer et al., 2019 36. Kiefer, A. ∙ Bader, C.D. ∙ Held, J. ... Synthesis of new cyclomarin derivatives and their biological evaluation towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum Chemistry. 2019; 25 :8894-8902 PubMed Google Scholar ), we had to use different attachment points than in sCym-1 ( Figure 4 C). We chose the N 1 -side chain on tryptophan and the adjacent valine unit of the cyclic dCymM peptide, as these building blocks are the last two added in the chemical synthesis, limiting adaptions of the previously established synthetic route. Moreover, it is known that modifications of these residues do not reduce the antibiotic properties of cyclomarin derivatives ( Kiefer et al., 2019 36. Kiefer, A. ∙ Bader, C.D. ∙ Held, J. ... Synthesis of new cyclomarin derivatives and their biological evaluation towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum Chemistry. 2019; 25 :8894-8902 PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that these side chains are not involved in binding to ClpC1 and thus represent suitable exit vectors. We further hypothesized that the replacement of the non-polar substituents with a rather lipophilic triazole-heterocycle should not significantly impair binding affinity to ClpC1. After attaching linker and JQ1 binding head, we obtained BacPROTAC-4 and BacPROTAC-5, respectively ( Figure 4 G). The dCymM containing degrader bound ClpC1 NTD with high affinity (K D = 0.2 μM; Figure S4 K) and induced BRDT BD1 degradation at lower concentrations than its sCym-1 analog ( Figure 4 H). Finally, we synthesized respective control compounds containing inactive enantiomers of the two headgroups ( Figure S4 I). Consistent with previous results with BacPROTAC-3a, BacPROTAC-5a with the distomeric JQ1( R ) group induced partial degradation only at high concentrations, while BacPROTAC-4a, containing a distomeric dCymM binding head, did no longer bind to ClpC1 NTD ( Figure S4 L) and did not induce significant BRDT BD1 degradation ( Figure 4 H).
Together these data indicate that both sCym-1 and dCymM moieties can be incorporated into the chemical adaptor, tolerating distinct linker attachment points to yield potent and selective degraders. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that BacPROTACs represent a versatile molecular tool that can be applied to various protein substrates and allow integration of diverse head groups and chemical linkers.
After validating the activity of the Cym-based BacPROTACs in vitro , we investigated whether they were able to reprogram ClpC1P1P2 in a cellular environment. For this purpose, we used M. smegmatis cells stably expressing BRDT BD1 to perform proteomics and degradation experiments ( Figure 5 A). We treated the culture with BacPROTAC-3 or alternatively the individual building blocks sCym-1 and JQ1. After 30-min incubation, we quantified BRDT BD1 levels using capillary western blots. We found that BacPROTAC-3 induced BRDT BD1 degradation in a concentration-dependent manner, while sCym-1 or JQ1 treatments did not significantly alter BRDT BD1 levels ( Figure 5 B).
Given the reported deregulation of ClpC1P1P2 by CymA ( Maurer et al., 2019 47. Maurer, M. ∙ Linder, D. ∙ Franke, K.B. ... Toxic activation of an AAA+ protease by the antibacterial drug cyclomarin A Cell Chem. Biol. 2019; 26 :1169-1179.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next assessed whether BacPROTAC-3 led to selective elimination of BRDT BD1 or had a global impact on the mycobacterial proteome. To address this point, we performed a tandem mass tag mass spectrometric (TMT-MS) analysis of M. smegmatis lysates. Isobaric labeling allowed the detection and quantification of 2,912 proteins. Among these, only BRDT BD1 was significantly (p < 0.001) depleted upon BacPROTAC-3 treatment ( Figure 5 C). Thus, the quantitative TMT-MS analysis provides compelling evidence that BacPROTAC-3 is capable of inducing degradation of the BRDT BD1 substrate in a highly specific manner.
To show that BRDT BD1 degradation results from direct engagement via BacPROTAC-3, we tested the inhibitory effect of JQ1 in mycobacteria. Upon co-incubation with JQ1, the induced BRDT BD1 degradation was strongly inhibited ( Figure 5 D), likely because the applied headgroup competes with the BacPROTAC for POI binding thus preventing its recruitment by the Clp protease. Furthermore, when treating the bacterial cultures with BacPROTAC-3a, containing the JQ1( R ) distomer, BRDT BD1 levels remained unchanged ( Figure 5 D). To further confirm these data, we designed a BRDT BD1-V56A mutant that was deficient in binding JQ1 but otherwise exhibited wild-type properties ( Figure S5 A). The introduced point mutation strongly reduced BacPROTAC-mediated degradation by the reconstituted Clp protease ( Figure S5 B). Likewise, we could not observe a reduction in BRDT BD1-V56A levels at the highest tested BacPROTAC-3 concentration in vivo , reflecting the impaired targeting of the mutant protein ( Figure 5 D). Accordingly, degradation by ClpC1P1P2 requires the direct engagement of BRDT BD1 through the JQ1 moiety of BacPROTACs. To confirm that the Cym head specifically targets ClpC1 inside mycobacteria, we tested BacPROTAC-4a containing the dCymM distomer. In contrast to the parent degrader, treatment of bacteria with BacPROTAC-4a did not lower BRDT BD1 levels in the cell ( Figure 5 E). Taken together, these in vivo data demonstrate that Cym-based BacPROTACs can reprogram ClpC1P1P2 to induce POI degradation in mycobacteria. Furthermore, our data show that despite its chemical modification, the cyclomarin scaffold maintains its ability to pass the mycobacterial cell envelope, providing an attractive tool for BacPROTAC development.
As BacPROTACs can induce the in vivo degradation of BRDT BD1 in a highly specific manner, we explored whether we could repurpose the JQ1/BRDT BD1 degron for conditional protein depletion in mycobacteria. BacPROTAC-induced protein degradation, to which we refer as BacPROTAC-induced degradation (BID) ( Figure 6 A), would represent a bacterial equivalent to eukaryotic systems of inducible protein degradation.
First, we tested the degradation of an ectopically expressed protein that is associated with a specific biological phenotype. As model protein, we selected D-alanylalanine synthase (DdlA), an essential component of the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway, which is also the major target of the broad-spectrum antibiotic D-cycloserine (DCS) ( Feng and Barletta, 2003 20. Feng, Z. ∙ Barletta, R.G. Roles of Mycobacterium smegmatis D-alanine:D-alanine ligase and D-alanine racemase in the mechanisms of action of and resistance to the peptidoglycan inhibitor D-cycloserine Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47 :283-291 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, it is known that overexpression of DdlA desensitizes M. smegmatis against DCS ( Feng and Barletta, 2003 20. Feng, Z. ∙ Barletta, R.G. Roles of Mycobacterium smegmatis D-alanine:D-alanine ligase and D-alanine racemase in the mechanisms of action of and resistance to the peptidoglycan inhibitor D-cycloserine Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47 :283-291 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to the wild-type protein, ectopic expression of the DdlA-BRDT BD1 fusion protein rendered M. smegmatis less susceptible to DCS, as reflected by the increased minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of DCS to inhibit growth ( Figure S6 A). These data indicate that the expressed DdlA-BRDT BD1 is fully functional in vivo . Importantly, addition of active BacPROTACs fully restored DCS sensitivity, whereas control compounds with distomeric JQ1 or cyclomarin head groups did not show this effect ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Consistent with the induced drug sensitivity, quantification of cellular DdlA-BRDT BD1 illustrated the decreased protein levels upon BacPROTAC treatment ( Figure S6 C). Together, the in vivo data demonstrate that the synthetic degraders induce removal of DdlA-BRDT BD1 , making cells more susceptible against DCS. Notably, DCS sensitivity was decreased even further than in cells expressing a vector control ( Figures 6 C and S6 A) pointing to an additive activity of BacPROTAC and DCS. Since DdlA exists as dimeric protein ( Bruning et al., 2011 9. Bruning, J.B. ∙ Murillo, A.C. ∙ Chacon, O. ... Structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis D-alanine:D-alanine ligase, a target of the antituberculosis drug D-cycloserine Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2011; 55 :291-301 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), the DdlA-BRDT BD1 fusion protein might associate with endogenous DdlA, co-targeting it to the ClpC1P1P2 protease. Consistent with this model, we found that cells treated with BacPROTAC were compromised in growth only when DdlA-BRDT BD1 —but not DdlA alone—was ectopically expressed ( Figure S6 B). The observed in vivo effects thus demonstrate the potential of the BID technology in exploring drug targets and antimicrobial combination therapies.
To illustrate the versatility of the JQ1/BRDT BD1 degron as research tool to eliminate a cellular protein, we aimed at evoking an auxotrophic phenotype in mycobacteria. As model substrate, we used the threonine synthetase ThrC, an essential enzyme catalyzing the last step in threonine biosynthesis ( Covarrubias et al., 2008 13. Covarrubias, A.S. ∙ Högbom, M. ∙ Bergfors, T. ... Structural, biochemical, and in vivo investigations of the threonine synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381 :622-633 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). After showing efficient degradation of ectopically expressed BRDT BD1 -ThrC in M. smegmatis by BacPROTAC-3 ( Figure S6 D), we integrated the BRDT BD1 coding region in front of the start codon of the thrC gene ( M. smegmatis thrC::BRDT BD1 -thrC ), allowing expression of the fusion protein under transcriptional control of the chromosomal locus. Expression of BRDT BD1 -ThrC did not interfere with cell growth, as the mutant strain showed similar growth characteristics as the wild-type strain. Strikingly, addition of active BacPROTACs induced a strong auxotrophic phenotype, which could be rescued by addition of L-threonine ( Figure 6 D). In contrast, BacPROTACs containing inactive head groups did not inhibit cell growth. Remarkably, the functional BacPROTAC-4 and 5 exhibited ∼15-fold different efficiencies in inducing auxotrophy, even though they carry the same head groups. As both compounds stimulate degradation in vitro to similar extents ( Figure 4 H), the observed in vivo difference seems to be related to distinct cell uptake properties caused by different linkers and linker attachment points on dCymM ( Figures 4 C and 4G). Moreover, it should be noted that BacPROTAC-3a and -5a combining the JQ1( R ) distomer and the active sCym-1 and dCymM head groups did not induce any growth defect ( Figures 6 C and 6D). These data indicate that binding of the cylomarin headgroup to ClpC1 does not cause pleiotropic effects under the applied conditions. As for DdlA-BRDT, the selective removal of the ThrC fusion protein further highlights the potential of the BacPROTAC technology as research tool, allowing induced degradation of target proteins from various cellular pathways.

Section: Discussion

In the present work, we developed small-molecule adaptors, BacPROTACs, that expand the targeted protein degradation technology to bacteria. The bi-functional adaptors redirect the ClpCP protease, the functional equivalent of the eukaryotic proteasome, to target neo-substrates in a highly specific manner. As seen for pArg and cyclomarin head groups, various molecules that bind to the substrate receptor of the ClpCP protease can be incorporated into a functional degrader. Using cell permeable BacPROTACs, we furthermore demonstrate that recruitment of model proteins to ClpCP leads to selective protein degradation in bacterial cells. A critical next step will be the targeting and induced elimination of an essential bacterial protein. As a first step in this direction, we show that targeted degradation of mycobacterial proteins fused to an enabled degron elicits bacteriotoxicity. Given the advantages of bi-functional degraders, such as their modular design and possibility to repurpose diverse protein ligands, BacPROTACs could open new horizons to develop antimicrobials with high selectivity and species specificity. Noteworthy, the developed approach is broadly applicable to bacterial proteins, since host-pathogen selectivity is achieved by reprogramming the ClpCP protease absent in mammalian cells. Considering the similar structural organization of bacterial ClpCP, ClpAP, and ClpXP proteases, which all employ the N-terminal domains of their ATPase units as substrate receptor, we propose that the BacPROTAC approach can be even expanded to related Clp proteolytic complexes and eventually used as universal method to reprogram bacterial proteases.
The possibility of eliminating a POI from the cell has broad applications for basic research as well. The function of proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is often studied by perturbation at the level of transcription or mRNA stability. In contrast to eukaryotes, the knockdown of prokaryotic proteins is often complicated by polycistronic gene arrangements, where interference with transcription of one gene often affects all downstream located open reading frames. Specific genetic manipulations can therefore be tedious and difficult, especially when dealing with essential proteins. Special strategies that allow conditional, reversible, and temporal control of protein levels are required. Conditional interference with gene transcription by CRISPRi techniques has been established as a method of choice in prokaryotes ( Mougiakos et al., 2018 48. Mougiakos, I. ∙ Bosma, E.F. ∙ Ganguly, J. ... Hijacking CRISPR-Cas for high-throughput bacterial metabolic engineering: advances and prospects Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2018; 50 :146-157 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this approach also has limitations, related to the co-repression of genes in polycistronic operons and leading to higher sensitivity to toxic compounds as well as to longer generation times ( Rock et al., 2017 64. Rock, J.M. ∙ Hopkins, F.F. ∙ Chavez, A. ... Programmable transcriptional repression in mycobacteria using an orthogonal CRISPR interference platform Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :16274 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chemical biology approaches that leverage the potency of small-molecule degraders could help to overcome these limitations. Prominent examples in eukaryotes are the auxin-induced degradation ( Nishimura et al., 2009 52. Nishimura, K. ∙ Fukagawa, T. ∙ Takisawa, H. ... An auxin-based degron system for the rapid depletion of proteins in nonplant cells Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :917-922 Crossref Scopus (1072) PubMed Google Scholar ), the FKBP12-degron based dTAG system ( Nabet et al., 2018 49. Nabet, B. ∙ Roberts, J.M. ∙ Buckley, D.L. ... The dTAG system for immediate and target-specific protein degradation Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14 :431-441 Crossref Scopus (548) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as the selective removal of HaloTag fusion proteins ( Neklesa et al., 2011 50. Neklesa, T.K. ∙ Tae, H.S. ∙ Schneekloth, A.R. ... Small-molecule hydrophobic tagging-induced degradation of HaloTag fusion proteins Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7 :538-543 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). By combining chemical biology with biochemistry and microbiology, we established an analogous prokaryotic system that enables selective degradation of endogenous proteins by the ClpC1P1P2 protease. This so-called BID system allows to carry out conditional knockdown experiments in mycobacteria. The system is based on fusing a target protein to the BRDT BD1 degron, which is a small bromodomain of 16 kDa that is stable in mycobacteria. BacPROTAC treatment leads to the selective degradation of the POI-BRDT BD1 fusion protein. As we have shown for the model proteins DdlA and ThrC, the BID method allows to characterize the function of essential bacterial proteins and explore their potential as antimicrobial targets. The method is also flexible in its application. It proved to be effective in vivo at different cytosolic POI concentrations, depending on whether expression of fusion proteins was governed from an inducible or endogenous promoter. Moreover, the BRDT BD1 degron was successfully added on both termini of the POI. Potential challenges such as impaired complex formation after degron fusion can be addressed by appropriate tag placement and linker design. However, it should be noted that not all fusion proteins yield efficient ClpCP substrates, as structural features of introduced POIs may affect degradability. It will thus be important to further test what properties make a favorable BacPROTAC substrate and eventually a promising antibiotic target. Importantly, our in vivo data show that the conditional proteolytic depletion of essential proteins can perturb cell growth up to the level of exhibiting antimicrobial activity. Using induced bacterial lethality as readout, systematic BID screens can be carried out to identify essential proteins in mycobacteria, such as ThrC and DdlA, that are amenable to the BacPROTAC technology and represent attractive targets for developing antibacterial compounds.
A limitation of the study lies in the apparent in vivo degradation efficiency that is less pronounced compared with our biochemical data. This discrepancy is likely due to the incomplete cell permeability of BacPROTACs, or adsorption by the mycobacterial extracellular matrix, lowering their effective intracellular concentration. Of note, the mycobacterial cell wall is densely decorated with lipids, yielding a waxy protection shield, not present in eukaryotic cells, that diminishes access of many chemicals. Though measuring intracellular concentrations of tested compounds could clarify this point, standard drug uptake assays are especially ambiguous for mycobacteria. Furthermore, in vivo degradation needs to be monitored at high cellular density if compound amount is limited. As bacterial cultures enter stationary phase at such condition, proteolytic activities are expected to be reduced. In contrast, the phenotypic readout of BacPROTAC activity in plate assays revealed them to be highly potent, and the in vivo efficacy is comparable to in vitro degradation assays.
Another note of caution relates to the cyclomarin group incorporated into BacPROTACs. By deregulating the ClpC1P1P2 protease, Cym-based degraders may interfere with cellular levels of unrelated proteins. Such indirect effects require controls when interpreting BID data, for example, by using BacPROTACs with binding-deficient head groups. In contrast, mycobacterial toxicity could enhance the antimicrobial potential of BacPROTACs. Compounds that target and reprogram ClpC1 would have a dual effect, disturbing the mycobacterial proteome and, in addition, targeting an essential POI for degradation. However, in vivo degradation is so far limited to the BRDT BD1 /JQ1 degron and respective fusion proteins. In order to take full advantage of small-molecule degraders as antibiotics, it will be now crucial to prove that endogenous bacterial proteins can be degraded in the same fashion.

M. smegmatis mc 2 -155 (ATCC 7000084) was directly purchased from ATCC and freshly inoculated from glycerol stocks. M. smegmatis thrC::BRDT BD1 -thrC was obtained as a single cross-over from M. smegmatis mc 2 -155 (ATCC 7000084) as described below and apart from the site of integration can be considered isogenic to the parental strain.
Liquid cultures of M. smegmatis were grown in 7H9 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) glycerol and 0.025% (v/v) Tween80 (Sigma). M. smegmatis transformed with the respective pMyC-POI vectors were additionally supplemented with 50 μg/ml Hygromycin. All liquid cultures were grown under constant agitation (200 rpm) at 37°C. If applicable, ectopic expression was induced with 0.1% (w/v) acetamide. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 x g, 5 min, 25 °C) and processed according to the respective experiment. Solid cultivation (agar-based assays as well as plating steps) was performed with 7H10 agar supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) glycerol. MIC assay plates for the POI DdlA were supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) acetamide and 50 or 100 μg/ml Hygromycin. Cells were plated out of the exponential growth phase and all plates were incubated for 2.5-5 days at 37 °C.
Cloning of constructs for Escherichia coli overexpression of full-length B. subtilis ClpC, ClpC DWB (E280A/E618A), ClpC NTD (1–148), ClpP, and BRDT BD1 was previously described ( Filippakopoulos et al., 2012 21. Filippakopoulos, P. ∙ Picaud, S. ∙ Mangos, M. ... Histone recognition and large-scale structural analysis of the human bromodomain family Cell. 2012; 149 :214-231 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ; Trentini et al., 2016 75. Trentini, D.B. ∙ Suskiewicz, M.J. ∙ Heuck, A. ... Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease Nature. 2016; 539 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). BRDT BD1-V56A was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of BRDT BD1. In case of expression constructs of B. subtilis ClpC, ClpC DWB , ClpC NTD and ClpP, all variants were fusion constructs containing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, except that for BRDT BD1 which contained a N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a TEV cleavage site.
Synthetic DNA of M. smegmatis clpP1 , clpP2 and clpC1 genes (MSMEG_4673, MSMEG_4672, MSMEG_6091) was ordered from GeneArt (Thermo Fisher) and cloned into a pET21a vector DNA. ClpP1 and ClpP2 expression constructs encode a C-terminal tetrahistidine tag fusion, while that of ClpC1 expresses wild type protein. The coding region of M. smegmatis clpC1 NTD (1–148) was cloned into pET21a and encodes a C-terminal hexahistidine tag fusion.
DNA for mSA-fusion constructs of three B. subtilis proteins (mSA-NrdI, mSA-TagD, mSA-NusA) cloned into a pETM14 vector was purchased from Genewiz. Expression constructs of mSA and mSA-Kre were cloned into a pNIC28-Bsa4 vector. These constructs encode a N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a TEV cleavage site fusion and a glycine-serine linker introduced between mSA and the bacterial protein. The mSA-Kre construct used for cryo-EM analysis was cloned into pET21a vector DNA and encodes a C-terminal hexahistidine tag fusion. All ORFs were verified for their correct sequence by DNA sequencing. Table S2 reports the translated amino acid sequences of all mSA-fusion proteins.
Plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) or Rosetta cells (for M. smegmatis ClpC1, ClpP1 and ClpP2 proteins) and grown in LB broth supplemented with the respective antibiotic at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.1-0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at an OD 600 of 0.8. Cells were cultured overnight at 18-20 °C, harvested by centrifugation and either lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM imidazole, and 0.25 mM tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), or flash frozen and stored at -80 °C until purification.
Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. His-tagged proteins were purified from the cleared supernatants using Ni-NTA Agarose beads in batch. After several washing steps, bound protein was eluted using 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 0.25 mM TCEP. Eluted protein was loaded onto a size exclusion chromatography column (Superdex 75 16/60 or Superdex 200 16/60 (GE Healthcare) depending on protein size) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. For ClpC and ClpC DWB purifications, the salt concentration of the size exclusion buffer was increased to 300 mM NaCl. Purified fractions were pooled and concentrated before flash freezing and stored at −80 °C.
Cell pellets for ClpP1 and ClpP2 purification were resuspended in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole and lysed by sonication. Cleared lysates were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (elution buffer: 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole) and subsequently by SEC using a Superose 6 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2, 150 mM KCl. 10% (v/v) glycerol was added to the elution fractions before flash freezing and storage at -80 °C. Processing of the full-length ClpP1 and ClpP2 to the mature ClpP1P2 complex was performed similar as previously described by Leodolter et al. ( Leodolter et al., 2015 38. Leodolter, J. ∙ Warweg, J. ∙ Weber-Ban, E. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis ClpP1P2 protease interacts asymmetrically with its ATPase partners ClpX and ClpC1 PLoS One. 2015; 10 :e0125345 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cell pellets for ClpC1 purification were resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 75 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol and lysed by sonication. After clarification of the lysate, ClpC1 was precipitated using 40% (w/v) ammonium sulphate. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, loaded on a HiLoad 26/10 Q Sepharose High Performance column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer and eluted in a gradient to 1 M KCl. ClpC1-containing fractions were pooled and precipitated again using 40% (w/v) ammonium sulphate. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2, 150 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and loaded on a HiLoad 16/10 Superdex 200 prep grade SEC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer. ClpC1 containing fractions were pooled and stored at -80 °C. Protein purity was monitored by Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE and correct molecular mass of purified proteins was verified by mass spectrometry.
ITC experiments were performed using a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC instrument (Malvern) at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. Each titration consisted of 19 injections with intervals of 120 s (the first injection of 0.4 μL was followed by 18 injections of 2 μL) at constant stirring at 750 rpm. DMSO concentration was matched between cell and syringe to be 2% (v/v). Data were fitted using a single binding site model with a fitted offset subtraction using the MicroCal PEAQ-ITC Analysis Software. Each titration was repeated at least twice.
Titrations involving BacPROTAC-1 were performed with the ligand loaded into the syringe and the protein into the cell. 400 μM BacPROTAC-1 was titrated against 20 μM ClpC NTD or mSA. A control titration of ligand into buffer was performed in order to determine the heat of dilution.
ITC experiments with BacPROTAC-4 and BacPROTAC-4a were performed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP. Each titration consisted of 19 injections with intervals of 150 s (the first injection of 0.4 μL was followed by 18 injections of 2 μL) at constant stirring at 750 rpm. DMSO concentration was matched between cell and syringe to be 4% (v/v).
Titrations involving sCym-1, BacPROTAC-2, BacPROTAC-3, BacPROTAC-4 and BacPROTAC-4a were performed with the ligand loaded into the cell and protein into the syringe to account for the low solubility of the compounds in aqueous solutions.
DSF experiments were carried out using a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). 5 μM BRDT BD1 or BRDT BD1-V56A were mixed with either DMSO or 25 μM JQ1 in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl with a final DMSO concentration of 2% (v/v) and 2.5X of Sypro Orange. The samples were heated from 25 °C to 95 °C with increments of 1 °C/minute, and fluorescence was measured at each step. Data analysis was performed as previously described ( Niesen et al., 2007 51. Niesen, F.H. ∙ Berglund, H. ∙ Vedadi, M. The use of differential scanning fluorimetry to detect ligand interactions that promote protein stability Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :2212-2221 Crossref Scopus (1888) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the analytical runs involving ClpC/C1 NTD and mSA or BRDT BD1 , the proteins were premixed at equimolar concentrations (25 μM) and BacPROTAC-1, BacPROTAC-2, BacPROTAC-3 (25 μM) dissolved in 100% (v/v) DMSO giving rise to a final concentration of 0.25% (v/v). For control experiments, only DMSO was added to that concentration. Samples were loaded into a 30 μL loop and applied to a Superdex 75 3.2/300 increase column (GE healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. Runs were performed at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.06 mL/min. Each run was performed in triplicates. 100 μL fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.
For electron microscopy analysis, B. subtilis ClpC DWB (25 μM monomer) and the substrate mSA-Kre (25 μM) were premixed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM ATP and 1.25% (v/v) DMSO or 156 μM BacPROTAC-1 (thereby adding 1.25% (v/v) DMSO as vehicle). A sample containing B. subtilis ClpC DWB (25 μM monomer) and 156 μM BacPROTAC-1 (1.25% (v/v) DMSO as vehicle) without mSA-Kre substrate was also prepared. For co-elution experiments with the arginine-phosphorylated substrate, pArg-β-casein was produced as previously described ( Trentini et al., 2016 75. Trentini, D.B. ∙ Suskiewicz, M.J. ∙ Heuck, A. ... Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease Nature. 2016; 539 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). B. subtilis ClpC DWB (25 μM monomer) and the substrate pArg-β-casein (25 μM) were premixed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 mM ATP.
For each sample prepared, 30 μL were loaded on a Superose 6 3.2/300 increase column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2.5 mM ATP. The experiment was performed at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.06 mL/min. 100 μL fractions were collected and used to prepare grids for EM analysis.
In vitro degradation assays containing 0.5 μM B. subtilis ClpC (hexameric), 0.5 μM B. subtilis ClpP (heptameric), 2 μM substrate protein, 15 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 10 U/mL pyruvate kinase (Sigma Aldrich) were performed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 (at 37 °C), 50 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 10% (v/v) glycerol. Compounds were dissolved in 100% (v/v) DMSO and further diluted giving rise to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) of DMSO in the assay. In control experiments DMSO was added to that concentration. Reactions were started by addition of 5 mM ATP and quenched by adding SDS sample buffer after two hours incubation at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Degradation assays using 0.5 μM M. smegmatis ClpC1 (hexameric), 0.25 μM M. smegmatis mature ClpP1P2 (both heptameric), 2 μM substrate protein, 15 mM PEP, 10 U/mL pyruvate kinase (Sigma Aldrich) were carried out in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10% (v/v) glycerol using the same procedure as described above. All experiments were performed in triplicates which gave similar results.
In the absence of BacPROTAC-1, ClpC DWB and the substrate mSA-Kre eluted separately in analytical SEC. The fraction containing ClpC DWB was applied onto glow-discharged carbon-coated Cu/Pd Hexagonal 400 mesh grids (Agar Scientific) subsequently stained with a solution of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The grids were screened and then imaged using a FEI Tecnai G2 20 microscope equipped with a 4k Eagle camera (FEI) using a pixel size of 1.8 Å/px. 1,004 micrographs were collected (a representative micrograph is shown in Figure S2 A) and 856 particles were manually picked and 2D classified, generating templates for subsequent automatic particle picking on the entire set of micrographs. 369,415 picked particles were extracted using box size of 300 px and subjected to 2D classification. The resulting highest populated 2D class averages are shown in Figure 2 B.
In the presence of BacPROTAC-1 alone (without mSA-Kre), ClpC DWB partially shifts to its activated state, eluting as a mixture of active and inactive oligomeric states. The formation of the tetramer of hexamers was confirmed by negative staining EM. The fraction highlighted in Figure S2 D was applied onto glow-discharged carbon-coated Cu/Pd Hexagonal 400 mesh grids (Agar Scientific) subsequently stained with a solution of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The grids were imaged using a FEI Morgagni microscope equipped with a Morada camera (Olympus-SIS) using a pixel size of 4.7 Å/px. 2 micrographs were collected (a representative area is shown in Figure S2 E) and 1441 particles were manually picked, extracted using box size of 120 px and 2D classified; the resulting highest populated 2D class averages are shown in Figure S2 E.
The fraction highlighted in Figure S2 D (containing the tetramer of ClpC hexamers) was used to reconstitute the ClpCP complex by addition of 1.5 μM of purified ClpP (relative to monomer). The sample was applied onto glow-discharged carbon-coated Cu/Pd Hexagonal 400 mesh grids (Agar Scientific) and stained with a solution of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The grids were screened and then imaged using a FEI Tecnai G2 20 microscope equipped with a 4k Eagle camera (FEI) using a pixel size of 1.8 Å/px. 84 micrographs were collected (a representative micrograph is shown in Figure S2 C) and 1358 particles were manually picked, extracted using box size of 500 px and 2D classified. The resulting highest populated 2D class averages are shown in Figure 2 G.
In the presence of equimolar amounts (relative to ClpC monomer) of arginine-phosphorylated β-casein, ClpC DWB fully shifts to its activated state. The formation of the tetramer of hexamers was confirmed by negative staining EM. The fraction highlighted in Figure S2 F was applied onto glow-discharged carbon-coated Cu/Pd Hexagonal 400 mesh grids (Agar Scientific) subsequently stained with a solution of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The grids were imaged using a FEI Morgagni microscope equipped with a Morada camera (Olympus-SIS) using a pixel size of 4.7 Å/px. 4 micrographs were collected (a representative area is shown in Figure S2 G) and 2877 particles were manually picked, extracted using box size of 120 px and 2D classified; the resulting highest populated 2D class averages are shown in Figure S2 G.
The ClpC DWB :BacPROTAC-1:mSA-Kre complex was isolated using analytical SEC. Cryo-EM grids were prepared using glow discharged R2/2 Cu 200 mesh grids (Quantifoil) pre-floated onto custom-made 2.9 nm continuous carbon film. 4 μL sample were applied onto a grid held in the sample grid chamber of a Leica EM GP instrument (Leica Microsystem Inc.) cooled at 4 °C, with a relative humidity of 80-90%. Grids were blotted 2 s with a Whatman type 1 filter paper using the blotting sensor and flash frozen in liquid ethane. The quality of the grids was screened using a Thermo Scientific Glacios Cryo Transmission Electron Microscope equipped with a Falcon3 Direct Electron Detector. For the best grid, a dataset of 4,455 micrographs was collected (a representative micrograph is shown in Figure S2 B) on a Titan Krios equipped with a Falcon 3EC detector with a nominal magnification of 75,000 resulting in pixel size of 1.058 Å/px. A total dose of 54 e - /Å 2 was fractionated into 40 frames. 452 poor quality images (heavy contamination, poor ice quality or bad information transfer) were discarded after visual inspection, leaving 4,003 images for further analysis.
Multi-frame micrographs were analyzed in cryoSPARC v2 ( Punjani et al., 2017 61. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ). The full micrographs were motion corrected and their contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated. 482 particles were manually picked and 2D classified, generating a template for subsequent automatic particle picking on the entire set of micrographs. 1,173,558 picked particles were extracted using box size of 500 px and subjected to two rounds of 2D classification, selecting only the classes containing the full tetramer of hexamers for further analysis. 87,575 “clean” particles were used for ab initio model generation and subsequent homogeneous refinement applying T symmetry. The approximate resolution of the obtained map was 10 Å as judged by Gold Standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) ( Figure S3A ).
For the analysis of the single hexamers, the same multi-frame micrographs were motion corrected and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 1.0.5 ( Zheng et al., 2017 86. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aligned micrographs were used for CTF estimation in Gctf 1.06 ( Zhang, 2016 85. Zhang, K. Gctf: real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ). A subset of 10 micrographs was used for manual particle picking in crYOLO v1.3.5 ( Wagner et al., 2019 78. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ), the picking centers were the single hexamers rather than the tetramer of hexamers. Manually picked particles were used to train a model for automatic particle picking on the full micrographs set (160 px box size). A total of 1,034,627 auto-picked particles were imported in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 87. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were extracted with 2 × 2 binning (box size 300 px, rescaled to 150 px) and subjected to two rounds of 2D classification. The particles belonging to the best 2D classes ( Figure 3 A) were re-extracted un-binned (box size 300 px) and 3D classified using an initial 3D model generated with cryoSPARC v2 ( Punjani et al., 2017 61. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 3D classification, 212,314 particles were selected for 3D refinement. The resolution was estimated with Gold Standard FSC, and B-factor sharpening was applied, both using the RELION postprocessing. The final map used for model building had an overall resolution of 3.7 Å. Local resolution was estimated in RELION and is shown in Figure S3 C.
An initial model was built in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 19. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) by rigid body fitting of secondary structure elements of one of the previously reported ClpC structures into the EM-map (PDB: 3J3U) ( Liu et al., 2013 43. Liu, J. ∙ Mei, Z. ∙ Li, N. ... Structural dynamics of the MecA-ClpC complex: a type II AAA+ protein unfolding machine J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :17597-17608 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). This model, however, required partial rebuilding and several steps of manual real-space refinement in Coot. Substrate-bound ClpB cryo-EM structures ( Deville et al., 2019 16. Deville, C. ∙ Franke, K. ∙ Mogk, A. ... Two-step activation mechanism of the ClpB disaggregase for sequential substrate threading by the main ATPase motor Cell Rep. 2019; 27 :3433-3446.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used as reference, as mSA-Kre binding caused substantial conformational rearrangements in the unfoldase hexamer when compared to the apo form of ClpC reported previously ( Liu et al., 2013 43. Liu, J. ∙ Mei, Z. ∙ Li, N. ... Structural dynamics of the MecA-ClpC complex: a type II AAA+ protein unfolding machine J. Biol.

Structure and mechanism of the hexameric MecA-ClpC molecular machine Nature. 2011; 471 :331-335 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). The substrate polypeptide chain was modelled as a poly-alanine. Phenix ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for further real-space refinement. The quality of the model and model to map fitting were assessed using Phenix ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct.

Methods. 2015; 12 :943-946 Crossref Scopus (542) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural illustrations were prepared using either UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2007 25. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Ferrin, T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :281-287 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ), UCSF ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 26. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ...

Schrödinger, LLC The PyMOL molecular graphics system Physiology. 2015; version 2.0 Google Scholar ).
ClpC1 NTD in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM sCym-1, and 1% (v/v) DMSO was crystallized in a hanging drop, vapor diffusion setup at 15 mg/mL concentration using a reservoir solution containing 100 mM MES/imidazole pH 6.5, 6% (w/v) PEG 20K, 12% (v/v) PEG MME 550, 120 mM 1,6-hexanediol, 120 mM 1-butanol, 120 mM ( RS )-1,2-propanediol, 120 mM 2-propanol and 120 mM 1,4-butanediol. Crystals were grown at room temperature for one week, subsequently harvested and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at an in-house X-ray generator and processed, scaled using the XDS ( Kabsch, 2010 33. Kabsch, W. Xds Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12932) PubMed Google Scholar ) package to a resolution of 1.7 Å. Initial phases were obtained by Molecular Replacement using PHASER and the structure of ClpC1 NTD (PDB: 3WDB) ( Vasudevan et al., 2013 77. Vasudevan, D. ∙ Rao, S.P. ∙ Noble, C.G. Structural basis of mycobacterial inhibition by cyclomarin A J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :30883-30891 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) as starting model. The model was improved in iterative cycles of manual building using Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 18. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refinement with Phenix ( Liebschner et al., 2019 41. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3348) PubMed Google Scholar ) omitting 5% of randomly selected reflections for calculation of R free . Model quality was monitored using MolProbity ( Williams et al., 2018 82. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: more and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2301) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the final model exhibited good stereochemistry with 97.5% of residues in favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and without any outliers ( Table S1 ). Structural illustrations were made using Pymol ( Schrödinger, 2015 71. Schrödinger, LLC The PyMOL molecular graphics system Physiology. 2015; version 2.0 Google Scholar ).
Plasmid DNA for BRDT BD1 expression in M. smegmatis mc 2 -155 containing the coding region of BRDT BD1 cloned into pMyC vector DNA (pMyC BRDT BD1 ) was ordered from Genescript. pMyC was a gift from Annabel Parret & Matthias Wilmanns (Addgene plasmid # 42192). Site directed mutagenesis was performed to obtain an expression plasmid pMyC-BRDT BD1-V56A . Gene blocks for the codon optimized coding region of the DdlA-BRDT BD1 -fusion protein were ordered from Integrated DNA technologies and cloned into the pMyC vector DNA via Gibson assembly. DdlA alone was cloned from DdlA-BRDT BD1 by excising BRDT resulting in a pMyC vector carrying DdlA alone. For expression of pMyC-BRDT-ThrC, the coding region of ThrC was amplified from genomic DNA, isolated from an exponential growing culture of ATCC 7000084 as described in ( Belisle et al., 2009 7. Belisle, J.T. ∙ Mahaffey, S.B. ∙ Hill, P.J. Isolation of Mycobacterium species genomic DNA Parish, T. ∙ Brown, A.C. (Editors) Mycobacteria protocols Humana Press, 2009; 1-12 Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar ), and fused with pMyC-BRDT via Gibson Assembly. M. smegmatis thrC::BRDT BD1 -thrC was obtained as a single cross-over from the parental strain M. smegmatis mc 2 -155 (ATCC 7000084) by homologous recombination as previously described ( Kendall and Frita, 2009 35. Kendall, S.L. ∙ Frita, R. Construction of targeted mycobacterial mutants by homologous recombination Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 465 :297-310 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a construct containing the 5’′ homology region of thrC including its start codon as well as an additional serine codon, the BRDT BD1 plus linker coding region, and the 3′ homology region comprising the entire thrC coding region and a 420 bp fragment from the downstream gene was integrated into the p2NIL (a gift from Tanya Parish; addgene plasmid # 20188) via Gibson assembly. DNA was PCR amplified from genomic or pMyC(BRDT BD1 ) DNA, respectively using the primers listed in Table S3 . After insertion of the appropriate selection cassettes excised from pGOAL-19 ( Parish and Stoker, 2000 53. Parish, T. ∙ Stoker, N.G. Use of a flexible cassette method to generate a double unmarked Mycobacterium tuberculosis tlyA plcABC mutant by gene replacement Microbiology (Reading). 2000; 146 :1969-1975 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ) (a gift from Tanya Parish; addgene plasmid # 20190) in the modified p2NIL, vector DNA was transformed and integrated into M. smegmatis mc 2 155. The original protocol from Kendall et al. ( Kendall and Frita, 2009 35. Kendall, S.L. ∙ Frita, R. Construction of targeted mycobacterial mutants by homologous recombination Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 465 :297-310 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) was optimized by increasing antibiotic strength and recovery after each selection step. Clones which have recombined via the 5′ homology regions in a single cross-over were identified by PCR using the primers listed in Table S3 . Cloning and vector DNA amplification was performed in E. coli XL10Gold following standard procedures. Transformation of expression vectors into M. smegmatis was performed according to ( Goude and Parish, 2008 27. Goude, R. ∙ Roberts, D.M. ∙ Parish, T. Electroporation of mycobacteria Mycobacteria Protocols Humana Press, NY, 2008; 117-130 Google Scholar ). Correctness of all plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing prior to transformation into M. smegmatis .
M. smegmatis was grown in 7H9 medium supplemented with the required antibiotics and grown under constant agitation at 37 °C. For in vivo degradation assays, protein expression was induced upon addition of 0.1% (w/v) acetamide when culturing M. smegmatis transformed with the respective pMyC-POI vectors. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in small amounts of prewarmed 7H9. Cultivation time after expression, induction as well as concentration factors after cell harvest required individual optimization for each POI to obtain cellular protein levels suitable to be monitored within the dynamic range of detection of the western capillary electrophoresis experiment.
Phenotype monitoring of BID for BRDT BD1 -degron fusion constructs with DdlA or ThrC was performed by determination of the Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of individual compounds using an agar-based assay similar as described previously ( Blanco-Ruano et al., 2015 8. Blanco-Ruano, D. ∙ Roberts, D.M. ∙ Gonzalez-Del-Rio, R. ... Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for Mycobacterium sp Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1285 :257-268 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sirgel et al., 2009 72. Sirgel, F.A. ∙ Wiid, I.J. ∙ van Helden, P.D. Measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations in mycobacteria Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 465 :173-186 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, DMSO dilution series of individual compounds were made in standard 96-well PCR plates. 1.5 μL aliquots of compound dilutions were transferred into final flat 96-well plates (Thermo Nunc Microwell). 150 μL of molten 7H10 agar at 45-50 °C was added and cooled to ambient temperature. Cells cultured in liquid medium were diluted in prewarmed medium to a final concentration of 1 x 10 5 cfu/mL and 5 μL were spotted into each well and incubated at 37 °C for 2.5-5 days before visual inspection. Initially, wild type strains were used to determine potential toxic effects of BacPROTACs or the individual head groups.
BID of DdlA_BRDT BD1 was studied in a classical checkerboard assay adapted from ( Feng and Barletta, 2003 20. Feng, Z. ∙ Barletta, R.G. Roles of Mycobacterium smegmatis D-alanine:D-alanine ligase and D-alanine racemase in the mechanisms of action of and resistance to the peptidoglycan inhibitor D-cycloserine Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47 :283-291 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sensitivity to increasing concentrations of D-cycloserine (DCS) was determined in the background of DdlA_BRDT BD1 , DdlA expression or an empty vector control. This was performed in presence of either functional BacPROTAC or control variants at sub-MIC concentration. To ensure sufficient expression of the individual proteins, liquid cultures were induced 90 minutes before spotting and the agar was supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) acetamide and 100 μg/mL hygromycin.
When monitoring the L-threonine auxotrophy after BID, M. smegmatis thrC::BRDT BD1 -thrC was grown to exponential growth phase in liquid culture, diluted and spotted on MIC plates with decreasing BacPROTAC concentration. In control experiments, auxotrophy was cured by addition of 1 mM L-threonine and potential reversion to the wild-type strain was excluded by control PCR as described above.
Aliquots of a dense cell suspension cultured as described above were mixed with various concentrations of the different BacPROTAC variants or their individual head groups in 96-well glass-coated microplates (Thermo Scientific). All dilutions were performed to yield a final concentration of 1% (v/v) DMSO in the medium. Aliquots of 250 μL of each cell suspension were withdrawn at the indicated timepoints, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μL of a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2, 150 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Cells were lysed for 10 minutes using the Bioruptor (Diagenode, 10 cycles, 30 seconds on - 30 seconds off) and the cell debris was cleared by centrifugation.
Cytosolic amounts of BRDT BD1 and RpoB in the lysates were analysed using Wes (ProteinSimple). Bacterial lysates were diluted 2-fold and analyzed using the Protein Simple 12-230 kDa Wes Separation Module following the manufacturer’s instructions. Anti-BRDT (Bio-Vision, rabbit) and anti-RpoB (BioLegend, mouse) antibodies were combined in a single primary antibody mixture for simultaneous BRDT BD1 and RpoB detection. The primary antibody mixture contained anti-BRDT diluted 1:250 and anti-RpoB diluted 1:25,000 or 1:10,000, respectively. BRDT BD1 and RpoB were detected using the Anti-Mouse (Protein Simple) and Anti-Rabbit (ProteinSimple) detection modules for Wes following the manufacturer’s instruction. Anti-Mouse antibodies were combined 1:10 or 1:30, respectively, and anti-Rabbit was used undiluted and the obtained secondary antibody mixtures were used for detection. Results were analyzed using the Compass for SW software (ProteinSimple). Compass displays the chemiluminescent signal detected along the length of the capillaries as electropherograms, where the intensity of the chemiluminescent signal is plotted against the apparent molecular weight (Exemplary traces Data S1 ). A statistical comparison is given in Data S1 based on the integrated peak areas summarized in Table S4 ). Detected peaks were quantified and include a peak at the expected BRDT BD1 molecular weight (BRDT BD1 MW = 16.6 kDa) and an additional peak at the expected RpoB molecular weight (MW = 128.5 kDa). Peak areas were normalized to DMSO-treated cells and plotted as mean ± SD.
For quantitative MS analysis, M. smegmatis cells expressing BRDT BD1 were treated for two hours with 1% (v/v) DMSO, 100 μM, 10 μM, or 1 μM BacPROTAC-3, following the procedures described above. Cleared lysates were processed according to the single-pot SP3 protocol ( Hughes et al., 2019 30. Hughes, C.S. ∙ Moggridge, S. ∙ Müller, T. ... Single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation for proteomics experiments Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :68-85 Crossref Scopus (706) PubMed Google Scholar ) for low input proteomics sample preparation. Each lysate of 100 μl was reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma Aldrich) for 45 minutes at 37 °C and subsequently alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA, Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for 1 hour. In parallel, a 1:1 mixture of 50 mg/mL Sera-Mag SpeedBeads, variant 1 (GE Healthcare) and 50 mg/mL Sera-Mag SpeedBeads, variant 2 (GE Healthcare), exhibiting different surface hydrophilicity, was prepared in water. To each lysate, 15 μL of the prepared SP3 bead stock was added and binding was induced by the addition of 100 μL ethanol. To ensure proper binding, samples were incubated on a shaker for 5 minutes at 24 °C and 1000 rpm. After protein binding, beads were washed three times with 200 μL rinsing solution (80% (v/v) ethanol in water) while being kept on a magnetic rack. Protein elution from the beads was enforced by addition of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH = 8.5, Sigma Aldrich). To disaggregate the beads, the tubes were shortly sonicated in a water bath. For protein digestion 1:25 wt/wt ratio of trypsin to protein was added and the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a thermo-shaker at 1,000 rpm.
Peptides were labelled for quantification in a multiplexed setup with TMT isobaric mass tags (TMTpro™ 16plex). Sample amount and quality was determined by HPLC-UV using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC RSLC nanosystem with a PepSwift Monolithic RSLC column (0.2 x 5 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 60 °C. Peptides were separated using a 20 minutes 2-90% elution gradient of buffer A (80% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (v/v) TFA in aqueous solution). For the labelling procedure, one TMTpro set was split into three aliquots to label three replicates. 14 channels (TMTpro 126-133N) were distributed over two timepoints for each of the seven treatments. The two remaining channels (133C and 134N) were used as reference channels with pools of all samples. Each sample was tagged with an excess of the respective TMT labelling reagent (1:20, peptide:TMT label) and incubated at room temperature for one hour. The reaction was quenched by addition of 5 μL 5% (v/v) hydroxylamine (Sigma Aldrich), followed by a 15 min incubation step. For each replicate, all 16 channels were pooled, and the volume was reduced to 100 μL in a vacuum concentrator. Removal of excess TMT labelling reagent was achieved by running the samples through tips filled with silica gel equilibrated in water.
Peptides were separated using a 40 min 2-50% gradient of buffer A in a high pH chromatography (TEA, pH = 8.5) setup using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC RSLC nanosystem with a XBridge Peptide BEH C18 Column (1 x 150 mm, 130 Å, 3.5 μm, Waters). 40 fractions were collected and pooled by combining every 11 th fraction to generate a final number of 10 fractions for each replicate. The volume of each sample was adjusted to 100 μL and the sample amount was estimated by running monolithic control runs.
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC RSLC nanosystem using an Acclaim PepMap C-18 precolumn (0.3 x 5 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an Acclaim PepMap C-18 column (50 cm x 75 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated using a 120 min linear gradient of 2-35% buffer A at a flowrate of 230 nL/min. MS1 spectra were generated in a 380-1,650 m/z mass range at a 120,000 orbitrap resolution, AGC target of 3e6, with a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The top 10 precursors were selected for MS2 analysis using a 0.7 m/z quadrupole precursor isolation window, allowing charge states 2-4 and a dynamic precursor exclusion of 30 s. The Orbitrap was operated at 45,000 resolution with an AGC of 1e5 and a NCE of 35 at a maximum injection time of 250 ms.
MS raw data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.3 (PD 2.3.0.523, Thermo) and the search was performed using the search engine MS Amanda ( Dorfer et al., 2014 17. Dorfer, V. ∙ Pichler, P. ∙ Stranzl, T. ... MS Amanda, a universal identification algorithm optimized for high accuracy tandem mass spectra J. Proteome Res. 2014; 13 :3679-3684 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ) against a database of the M. smegmatis 2019 Uniprot Reference Proteome with contaminants and the BRDT BD1 protein added. The database search allowed tryptic peptides with two missed cleavages at a precursor mass tolerance of 5 ppm and 0.02 Da MS2 tolerance. Static alkylation of cysteine and variable oxidation of methionine and TMTpro adducts on lysine and peptide N-termini were considered. Peptides were scored and filtered using Percolator ( Käll et al., 2007 34. Käll, L. ∙ Canterbury, J.D. ∙ Weston, J. ... Semi-supervised learning for peptide identification from shotgun proteomics datasets Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :923-925 Crossref Scopus (1619) PubMed Google Scholar ) to obtain peptides at a 1% false discovery rate. Reporter ions were quantified using the IMP Hyperplex ( https://ms.imp.ac.at/?goto=pd-nodes ) at a reporter mass tolerance of 10 ppm with a MS2 precursor threshold of 10. The search was performed for each replicate separately over the ten fractions.
Statistical analysis and data normalization were performed in R. The samples were first normalized for different sample loading by their total sum within each replicate set and then the three TMT replicates were normalized using the Internal Reference Scaling (IRS) method ( Plubell et al., 2017 58. Plubell, D.L. ∙ Wilmarth, P.A. ∙ Zhao, Y. ... Extended multiplexing of tandem mass tags (TMT) labeling reveals age and high fat diet specific proteome changes in mouse epididymal adipose tissue Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2017; 16 :873-890 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). Median alignment was done afterwards by TMM normalization. For each protein, the fold change of TMT-intensities and the corresponding p value (two-tailed Student’s T-test,) were calculated. Permutation-based FDR calculation was used to assess the q-values. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE ( Perez-Riverol et al., 2019 56. Perez-Riverol, Y. ∙ Csordas, A. ∙ Bai, J. ...
