Title: Functional SARS-CoV-2-Specific Immune Memory Persists after Mild COVID-19


Abstract: Summary

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is causing a global pandemic, and cases continue to rise. Most infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that could contribute to immunity. We performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mild COVID-19 to determine whether they develop and sustain multifaceted SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory. Recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies, neutralizing plasma, and memory B and memory T cells that persisted for at least 3 months. Our data further reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG memory B cells increased over time. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral function: memory T cells secreted cytokines and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, whereas memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks of antiviral immunity.

Section: Introduction

The rapidly spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) betacoronavirus has infected millions of people and killed hundreds of thousands worldwide in 2020. Infection causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which ranges in presentation from asymptomatic to fatal. The vast majority of infected individuals experience mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization ( Wu and McGoogan, 2020 60. Wu, Z. ∙ McGoogan, J.M. Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72 314 Cases From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention JAMA. 2020; 323 :1239-1242 Crossref Scopus (12761) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is critically important to understand if SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals who recover from mild disease develop functional immune memory cells capable of protection from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections, thereby reducing transmission and COVID-19 disease.
Immunological memory is primarily mediated by cells of the adaptive immune system. In response to most acute viral infections, B and T cells that can bind viral proteins through their antigen receptors and become activated, expand, differentiate, and begin secreting effector molecules to help control the infection. Upon resolution of infection, approximately 90% of these virus-specific “effector cells” die, whereas 10% persist as long-lived “memory” cells ( Ruterbusch et al., 2020 40. Ruterbusch, M. ∙ Pruner, K.B. ∙ Shehata, L. ... In Vivo CD4 + T Cell Differentiation and Function: Revisiting the Th1/Th2 Paradigm Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 38 :705-725 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immune memory cells can produce a continuous supply of effector molecules, as seen with long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells (LLPCs). In most cases, however, quiescent memory lymphocytes are strategically positioned to rapidly reactivate in response to re-infection and execute effector programs imprinted upon them during the primary response. Upon re-infection, pathogen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) that express receptors associated with antigen experience and the transcription factor T-bet rapidly proliferate and differentiate into protective immunoglobulin (Ig)G + antibody-secreting plasmablasts (PBs) ( Kim et al., 2019 21. Kim, C.C. ∙ Baccarella, A.M. ∙ Bayat, A. ...

Knox, J.J. ∙ Myles, A. ∙ Cancro, M.P. T-bet + memory B cells: Generation, function, and fate Immunol. Rev. 2019; 288 :149-160 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nellore et al., 2019 31. Nellore, A. ∙ Scharer, C.D. ∙ King, R.G. ... Fcrl5 and T-bet define influenza-specific memory B cells that predict long-lived antibody responses bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Reactivated T-bet-expressing memory CD4 + T cells proliferate, “help” activate MBCs, and secrete cytokines (including interferon [IFN]-γ) to activate innate cells ( Ruterbusch et al., 2020 40. Ruterbusch, M. ∙ Pruner, K.B. ∙ Shehata, L. ... In Vivo CD4 + T Cell Differentiation and Function: Revisiting the Th1/Th2 Paradigm Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 38 :705-725 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ). Meanwhile, memory CD8 + T cells also secrete cytokines and kill virus-infected cells directly through the delivery of cytolytic molecules ( Schmidt and Varga, 2018 43. Schmidt, M.E. ∙ Varga, S.M. The CD8 T Cell Response to Respiratory Virus Infections Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :678 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). These quantitatively and qualitatively enhanced virus-specific memory populations coordinate to quickly clear the virus, thereby preventing disease and reducing the chance of transmission. It is therefore critical to assess the full cadre of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory responses to determine whether mild infection induces a lasting, multilayered defense.
To infect cells and propagate, SARS-CoV-2 relies on the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike (S) protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 16. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor Cell. 2020; 181 :271-280.e8, e278 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13640) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple studies have shown that the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals produce S- and RBD-specific antibodies during the first 2 weeks of the primary response and that RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies can neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo ( Long et al., 2020 27. Long, Q.-X. ∙ Liu, B.-Z. ∙ Deng, H.-J. ... Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :845-848 Crossref Scopus (2078) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robbiani et al., 2020 38. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2020 47. Shi, R. ∙ Shan, C. ∙ Duan, X. ... A human neutralizing antibody targets the receptor-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2020; 584 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (934) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, RBD-specific antibodies would likely contribute to protection in response to reinfection if maintained in the plasma by LLPCs or rapidly expressed by MBCs.
We therefore assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses at 1 and 3 months post-symptom onset in individuals that had experienced mild COVID-19. We found that a multipotent SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory response forms and is maintained in recovered individuals for the duration of our study. Furthermore, persistent memory lymphocytes display hallmarks of protective antiviral immunity, including a numerically increased population of virus-specific memory B cells capable of expressing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

Section: Results

To determine whether immune memory cells form after mildly symptomatic COVID-19, we collected plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 15 individuals recovered from mild COVID-19 (CoV2 + ) (UW IRB 00009810). The CoV2 + group had a median age of 47 and reported mild symptoms lasting a median of 13 days ( Table 1 ). The first blood sample (Visit 1) was drawn at least 20 days after a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and a median of 35.5 days post-symptom onset. We expect the primary response to be contracting and early memory populations to be generated at this time point, as viral load is cleared approximately 8 days post-symptom onset ( Wölfel et al., 2020 59. Wölfel, R. ∙ Corman, V.M. ∙ Guggemos, W. ... Virological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019 Nature. 2020; 581 :465-469 Crossref Scopus (4732) PubMed Google Scholar ). Participants returned for a second blood draw (Visit 2) a median of 86 days post-symptom onset so we could assess the quantity and quality of the long-lived memory populations ( Figure 1 A). We compared these samples to samples collected at 2 time points representing a similar sampling interval in a group of 17 healthy controls (HCs). All HCs were considered to have no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on having no detectable plasma SARS-CoV-2 RBD- or S-specific antibodies above 3 standard deviations (SDs) of the mean of historical negative (HN) plasma samples drawn prior to 2020 ( Figure S1 ).
Populations of activated innate and adaptive immune cells expand in the blood during the primary response to SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Mathew et al., 2020 29. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ..., UPenn COVID Processing Unit Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 :eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). When an acute viral infection is cleared, the majority of these highly inflammatory cells either die or become quiescent memory cells such that the proportions and phenotypes of total immune cells are indistinguishable from those seen in pre-infection blood samples. Consistent with resolution of the primary response, we found no differences in frequency of total monocytes, monocyte subsets, or plasmacytoid dendritic cells among PBMCs between CoV2 + and HC individuals ( Figure S2 ). We also found no differences in γδ or αβ CD3 + T cell frequencies (CD4 + or CD8 + ), cell cycle status, expression of molecules associated with activation, migration, function, or proportions of various CD45RA – memory T cell subsets ( Figures S3 A–S3H). We also found no differences in frequency of CD19 + B cells ( Figure S3 I). Together, these data demonstrate that the inflammatory response associated with acute infection had resolved by the Visit 1 time point and that the early immune memory phase had commenced.
Humoral immune responses are characterized by a first wave of short-lived, low-affinity antibody-secreting PBs followed by a subsequent germinal center (GC) response that generates high-affinity MBCs and antibody-secreting LLPCs. LLPCs can maintain detectable plasma antibody titers for months to many years, depending upon the specific viral infection ( Slifka and Ahmed, 1996 48. Slifka, M.K. ∙ Ahmed, R. Long-term antibody production is sustained by antibody-secreting cells in the bone marrow following acute viral infection Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1996; 797 :166-176 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). PBs are formed during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but are no longer present in recovered individuals at approximately 1 month post-symptom onset ( Mathew et al., 2020 29. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ..., UPenn COVID Processing Unit Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 :eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that antibodies measured at Visit 1 might include significant contributions from short-lived PBs that are no longer present, but based on calculations of antibody half-life (approximately 23 days; Cohen and Freeman, 1960 11. Cohen, S. ∙ Freeman, T. Metabolic heterogeneity of human gamma-globulin Biochem. J. 1960; 76 :475-487 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), only an estimated 6% of PB-derived antibodies present at Visit 1 would be retained at Visit 2. At Visit 2, LLPCs are therefore likely contributing the majority of antibodies and maintaining the level of RBD-specific antibodies in the blood. We therefore examined the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in plasma at Visit 1 and Visit 2 ( Ma et al., 2020 28. Ma, H. ∙ Zeng, W. ∙ He, H. ... Serum IgA, IgM, and IgG responses in COVID-19 Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2020; 17 :773-775 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). At Visit 1, all of CoV2 + individuals had plasma anti-RBD IgG levels 3 SDs above the mean of HCs, as measured by ELISA area under the curve (AUC), in accordance with studies showing 100% seroprevalence by day 14 ( Long et al., 2020 27. Long, Q.-X. ∙ Liu, B.-Z. ∙ Deng, H.-J. ... Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :845-848 Crossref Scopus (2078) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B). Additionally, the majority of CoV2 + individuals had anti-RBD IgM and anti-RBD IgA above this negative threshold and possessed IgG, IgM, and IgA anti-spike antibodies above the threshold at Visit 1 as well ( Figure S4 A). Levels of anti-RBD and anti-spike binding were highly correlated for all isotypes ( Figure S4 B). At Visit 2, all CoV2 + individuals maintained anti-RBD IgG levels above the negative threshold, but fewer CoV2 + individuals maintained anti-RBD IgM and IgA ( Figure 1 B). Anti-RBD IgG levels decreased only slightly among CoV2 + individuals between time points, suggesting the IgG antibody levels were being stabilized by the formation of antibody-secreting LLPCs. Anti-RBD IgM and IgA, however, decreased substantially from Visit 1 to Visit 2, suggesting expression from early PBs that is not maintained by LLPCs ( Figure 1 C).
As spike protein, and specifically the RBD, is key for viral entry into the cell, antibodies that target the RBD can be potent inhibitors of infection ( Robbiani et al., 2020 38. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2020 47. Shi, R. ∙ Shan, C. ∙ Duan, X. ... A human neutralizing antibody targets the receptor-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2020; 584 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (934) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether CoV2 + individuals form and maintain neutralizing antibodies, we tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization indirectly by using a cell-free assay of RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition (surrogate virus neutralization test, sVNT) and directly in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) ( Tan et al., 2020 51. Tan, C.W. ∙ Chia, W.N. ∙ Qin, X. ... A SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test based on antibody-mediated blockage of ACE2-spike protein-protein interaction Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1073-1078 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ). CoV2 + plasma inhibited RBD binding to ACE2 significantly more than did HC plasma by sVNT, and RBD inhibition correlated strongly with anti-RBD IgG levels at both time points ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Further, CoV2 + plasma RBD inhibition capacity was maintained from Visit 1 to Visit 2 ( Figure 1 F). Neutralization by PRNT correlated strongly with RBD inhibition at both time points ( Figure 1 G) and was similarly maintained between visits ( Figure 1 H). The majority of CoV2 + plasma achieved at least 50% neutralization by PRNT at a 1:160 dilution at both time points. By the latest time point in our study, the majority of CoV2 + individuals still had better RBD-inhibiting plasma and better neutralizing plasma than did HCs. These data are consistent with the emergence of IgG + RBD-specific LLPCs that maintain detectable neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to at least 3 months post-symptom onset.
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies 3 months post-symptom onset in CoV2 + individuals suggests that GC-derived LLPCs have formed. GCs also produce long-lived MBCs that play a critical role in the formation of high-affinity antibody-secreting PBs upon antigen re-exposure and can be long-lived. We therefore tested whether SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs were formed and maintained in CoV2 + individuals throughout the study’s time course. We generated RBD tetramer reagents and used enrichment strategies to identify and phenotype rare RBD-specific B cells that are otherwise undetectable ( Krishnamurty et al., 2016 25. Krishnamurty, A.T. ∙ Thouvenel, C.D. ∙ Portugal, S. ... Somatically Hypermutated Plasmodium-Specific IgM(+) Memory B Cells Are Rapid, Plastic, Early Responders upon Malaria Rechallenge Immunity. 2016; 45 :402-414 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested the specificity of our reagent in RBD-immunized mice ( Walls et al., 2020 56. Walls, A.C. ∙ Fiala, B. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... Elicitation of Potent Neutralizing Antibody Responses by Designed Protein Nanoparticle Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2020; S0092-8674(20)31450-1 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) Google Scholar ) and then used it to identify, enumerate, and phenotype rare, RBD-specific B cells in PBMCs from HC and CoV2 + individuals. Gates used to phenotype RBD-specific B cells were defined on total B cell populations ( Figure S5 A).
At Visit 1, RBD-specific B cells were expanded in CoV2 + individuals in comparison with HCs, and their numbers in CoV2 + individuals increased significantly from Visit 1 to Visit 2 ( Figures 2 A and 2B). As expected, we found very few CD20 − CD38 + RBD-specific antibody-secreting cells (PBs or PCs) in the blood of HC or CoV2 + individuals at either time point, supporting the idea that LLPCs, likely in the bone marrow, are producing the majority of RBD-specific antibody at Visit 2 ( Figure 2 C). Expression of CD21 and CD27 distinguishes CD21 + CD27 − naive B cells from CD21 + CD27 + classical MBCs and CD21 − CD27 +/− activated MBCs ( Weisel and Shlomchik, 2017 57. Weisel, F. ∙ Shlomchik, M. Memory B Cells of Mice and Humans Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35 :255-284 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). The majority of RBD-specific B cells in CoV2 + individuals were CD21 + CD27 + classical MBCs, whereas the majority of RBD-specific B cells in HC individuals were naive ( Figures 2 D and 2E). The number of RBD-specific MBCs in CoV2 + samples were on average significantly greater than in HCs and increased even further at Visit 2 ( Figure 2 F). Class switching of B cell receptors (BCRs) from IgM and IgD to IgG, IgA, or IgE is associated with BCR affinity maturation usually needed to form high-affinity neutralizing antibodies ( Weisel and Shlomchik, 2017 57. Weisel, F. ∙ Shlomchik, M. Memory B Cells of Mice and Humans Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35 :255-284 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). CoV2 + RBD-specific MBCs were enriched for IgG + MBCs, whereas the smaller number of HC RBD-specific MBCs were predominantly unswitched (IgM + and IgD + ) ( Figures 2 G, 2H, and S5 B). Most strikingly, the increased numbers of IgG + RBD-specific MBCs seen in CoV2 + individuals as compared to HC individuals at Visit 1 were even further enhanced at Visit 2 ( Figure 2 I). Relatively few of the CoV2 + RBD-specific MBCs expressed IgA, but their number was significantly higher than in HC individuals at both time points ( Figure S5 B).
An additional measure of antiviral MBC function is the expression of T-bet ( Knox et al., 2017a 22. Knox, J.J. ∙ Buggert, M. ∙ Kardava, L. ... T-bet+ B cells are induced by human viral infections and dominate the HIV gp140 response JCI Insight. 2017; 2 :92943 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). MBCs that express T-bet are associated with rapid differentiation into secondary PBs that produce high-affinity, viral-specific antibodies during a secondary infection ( Knox et al., 2017b 23. Knox, J.J. ∙ Kaplan, D.E. ∙ Betts, M.R. T-bet-expressing B cells during HIV and HCV infections Cell. Immunol. 2017; 321 :26-34 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found on average a higher number of T-bet + RBD-specific MBCs in CoV2 + individuals than in HCs at Visit 1, and the higher numbers were maintained at Visit 2 ( Figure 2 J). Together these data demonstrate that IgG + RBD-specific classical MBCs not only form and persist in response to mild COVID-19, but their numbers continue to increase from 1 to 3 months post-symptom onset.
The presence of T-dependent IgG + RBD-specific MBCs suggested that antigen-specific memory T cell responses were also present in CoV2 + individuals. To enumerate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + memory T cells, total PBMCs from HC or CoV2 + individuals were incubated with vehicle control or spike protein, and activation marker expression was assessed 20 h later ( Figure 3 A) ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 7. Bentebibel, S.E. ∙ Lopez, S. ∙ Obermoser, G. ... Induction of ICOS+CXCR3+CXCR5+ TH cells correlates with antibody responses to influenza vaccination Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5 :176ra32 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reiss et al., 2017 36. Reiss, S. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ∙ Cirelli, K.M. ... Comparative analysis of activation induced marker (AIM) assays for sensitive identification of antigen-specific CD4 T cells PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0186998 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first focused on the activation-induced expression of members of specific T-B receptor-ligand pairs including ICOS and CD40L. CD4 + T cells from CoV2 + individuals at both Visit 1 and 2 demonstrated enhanced expression of ICOS and CD40L after re-activation with spike protein in comparison with vehicle control ( Figure 3 B). Small numbers of spike-responsive activated CD4 + T cells could also be found in a few HC individuals, but on average these were not significantly increased across the HC cohort. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the numbers of responding cells in CoV2 + individuals between Visit 1 and Visit 2, demonstrating that spike-specific memory CD4 + T cells were maintained throughout the study ( Figure 3 B). In addition, greater numbers of CXCR5-expressing circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells ( Vinuesa et al., 2016 54. Vinuesa, C.G. ∙ Linterman, M.A. ∙ Yu, D. ... Follicular Helper T Cells Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34 :335-368 Crossref Scopus (799) PubMed Google Scholar ) capable of migrating to B cell follicles were seen in re-stimulated samples from CoV2 + individuals than from HC individuals, and this was maintained between visits ( Figure 3 C). Together these data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4 + T cells are maintained, and some retain the capacity to provide B cell help, at 3 months post-symptom onset.
Antigen-specific memory CD4 + T cells proliferate to re-seed the memory pool and generate effector cells upon antigen re-exposure ( Sallusto et al., 1999 42. Sallusto, F. ∙ Lenig, D. ∙ Förster, R. ... Two subsets of memory T lymphocytes with distinct homing potentials and effector functions Nature. 1999; 401 :708-712 Crossref Scopus (4828) PubMed Google Scholar ). To formally demonstrate that spike-specific CD4 + T cells in CoV2 + individuals were of a memory phenotype prior to re-stimulation, we measured the proliferative capacity of pre-sorted memory or naive subsets in response to spike re-stimulation. For this, we sorted CD45RA + naive, CD45RA – CCR7 + central memory (T CM ) and CD45RA – CCR7 – effector memory (T EM ) T cells from HC or CoV2 + individuals and cultured them for 5–6 days with autologous CD14 + monocytes and recombinant spike protein ( Figure S6 A). We next determined the frequency of cells that proliferated and therefore diluted a cell proliferation dye (CPD) after 5–6 days of culture ( Figure 3 D). We additionally examined the expression of CCR6 + (associated with IL-17-producing Th17 cells), and CXCR3 + (associated with IFN-γ producing Th1 cells), as Th1 and Th17 subsets have been associated with protection from other respiratory viral infections ( Sallusto, 2016 41. Sallusto, F. Heterogeneity of Human CD4(+) T Cells Against Microbes Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34 :317-334 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). In CoV2 + individuals, a small population of proliferated (CPD lo ) CXCR3 + CD4 + Th1 cells emerged from sorted naive cells after 5 days of culture, perhaps representing contaminating memory cells, as these were not seen in HC individuals ( Figure 3 E). Sorted T CM cells from all CoV2 + individuals tested displayed significantly higher frequencies of CXCR3 + CPD lo T cells that proliferated in response to spike than did HC samples. Although substantial proliferative responses were observed in T EM cells in some CoV2 + individuals, this was more variable across the CoV2 + group than what was seen in the T CM cells. Together these data demonstrate that, in individuals that have recovered from mild COVID-19, predominantly CXCR3-expressing spike-specific T CM , and in some individuals CXCR3-expressing T EM , persist and have the ability to proliferate and re-populate the memory pool upon antigen re-encounter.
Memory T cells rapidly express a wide variety of cytokines to engage, recruit, or activate innate cells or other adaptive lymphocytes. We next performed a detailed analysis of the cytokine profiles of spike-responsive memory T cells that persisted at Visit 2 in CoV2 + and HC individuals to gain a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory cell function. Production of specific cytokines by CD4 + CXCR5 + memory Tfh cells can influence B cell activation and class switching, whereas CD4 + CXCR5 − T effector (Teff) cells express high levels of cytokines to engage antiviral programs. Cytokines generated by a variety of T helper subsets were examined (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-17), and staining was confirmed on PMA/ionomycin activated CD69 + cells (representative plots shown in Figure S6 B). Activated CD69 + CD4 + memory cells were further subset by CCR6 and CXCR5 expression, as predominant populations of spike-specific CCR6 + CXCR5 + cTfh were recently described early after SARS-CoV2 infection ( Juno et al., 2020 18. Juno, J.A. ∙ Tan, H.X. ∙ Lee, W.S. ... Humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell responses in recovered patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1428-1434 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 C). After spike re-stimulation, the CoV2 + samples demonstrated significant numbers of activated, cytokine-producing cells in comparison to vehicle controls, whereas some HC samples exhibited small numbers of activated, cytokine-producing cells ( Figure 3 F). The cytokine production in the CoV2 + samples was dominated by the expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ, with less frequent IL-17A production and no significant IL-4 production noted ( Figures 3 G and S6 D). Spike-responsive CCR6 − subsets expressed higher frequencies of IL-2 and IFN-γ than CCR6 + cells, whereas the few IL-17 producers present expressed CCR6 as expected. Together these data demonstrate that functional, spike-specific memory CXCR5 + cTfh and CXCR5 − Teff cells persist 3 months after symptom onset that predominantly make Th1 cytokines, with a small IL-17A-producing population.
Although much recent work has focused on antibodies and B cells, memory CD8 + T cells are uniquely positioned to kill virus-infected cells through their directed expression of cytokines and cytolytic molecules. We therefore interrogated the presence of functional CD8 + memory T cells in the same cytokine reactivation assays and samples described above. Spike-specific memory CD8 + T cells that persisted for 3 months after mild COVID-19 disease could be identified by expression of the activation marker CD69 and expression of the cytokine IFN-γ after incubation with SARS-CoV-2 spike for 20 h ( Figure 3 H). Unlike CD4 + memory T cells, however, activated cytokine-expressing CD8 + T cells were significantly increased in number over the cells incubated with vehicle in both HC and CoV2 + groups ( Figure 3 I). Together, these data demonstrate that Th1 CD4 + SARS-CoV-2-specific cTfh and non-Tfh memory T cells are maintained and able to produce effector cytokines after re-stimulation 3 months post-symptom onset in mildly symptomatic COVID-19 individuals. These data further suggest that a population of IFN-γ-producing, cross-reactive CD8 + T cells exist in healthy controls.
Because SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific MBC and S-specific CD4 + cTfh were enriched in CoV2 + individuals after 3 months, we asked whether these MBCs had the potential to produce neutralizing antibodies if reactivated by a secondary infection. To this end, we index sorted single RBD-specific B cells and sequenced the BCRs from 3 CoV2 + individuals at both time points ( Figures S7 A and 4 A). We sequenced all IgG + RBD-specific classical MBCs (CD21 + CD27 + ), cloned paired heavy and light chain sequences that were obtained, and expressed them as IgG1 monoclonal antibodies. In total, this comprised 19 antibodies from Visit 1 and 16 from Visit 2.
These antibodies were first expressed in small scale cultures for screening. Transfection supernatants were assessed for antibody expression by IgG ELISA ( Figures S7 B and S7D) and specificity by RBD ELISA, where all but 1 antibody at each time point showed strong binding to RBD ( Figures 4 B and 4D). Antibodies were then assessed for their capacity to inhibit RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor by sVNT assay. Eight of 18 antibodies cloned from subjects at Visit 1 (44%) and 7 of 15 from Visit 2 (47%) were able to inhibit RBD binding to ACE2 ( Figures 4 C and 4E). Although 2 of the Visit 1 antibodies showed lower levels of inhibition, the others showed levels of inhibition similar to a strongly neutralizing alpaca nanobody ( Hanke et al., 2020 14. Hanke, L. ∙ Vidakovics Perez, L. ∙ Sheward, D.J. ... An alpaca nanobody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by blocking receptor interaction Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4420 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). These antibodies were then expressed on a larger scale and purified for more detailed analysis. The specificity of the purified antibodies for RBD was again confirmed by ELISA ( Figures S7 C and S7E), and all Visit 2 inhibitors, the majority of Visit 1 inhibitors, and several non-inhibitors were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity by PRNT assay. All of the inhibitory antibodies were able to strongly neutralize the virus, with IC 50 values ranging from 7.15 to 49.61 ng/mL ( Figures 4 F and 4G). This was comparable to a previously published strongly neutralizing mouse antibody (2B04) which was included as a positive control (IC 50 = 3.6 ng/mL) ( Alsoussi et al., 2020 4. Alsoussi, W.B. ∙ Turner, J.S. ∙ Case, J.B. ... A Potently Neutralizing Antibody Protects Mice against SARS-CoV-2 Infection J. Immunol. 2020; 205 :915-922 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two of the non-inhibitory antibodies (#205 and #211) were unable to inhibit virus infection as expected, similar to a non-neutralizing mouse antibody (2C02) and an irrelevant Plasmodium -specific human antibody (MSP-003). Interestingly, the other 2 non-inhibitory antibodies tested (#203 and #207) were able to neutralize live virus, with #203 having an IC 50 comparable to the strong inhibitors (15.4 ng/mL), suggesting that the sVNT assay does not detect all monoclonal RBD-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing live virus. More than 50% of the antibodies tested showed activity by one or both of these methods.
This set of antibodies utilized a wide variety of heavy and light chains, had all undergone somatic hypermutation (SHM) and were all unique clones ( Tables 2 and S1 ). Somatic hypermutation (SHM) levels in both heavy and light chains increased on average between Visit 1 and Visit 2, but these differences were not statistically significant ( Figures S7 F and S7G). Thus, RBD-specific MBCs induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are capable of producing a variety of neutralizing antibodies against the virus and could contribute to protection from a second exposure.
In response to human viral infections such as measles, polio, and hepatitis A, the amount and function of virus-specific IgG + antibodies, IgG + MBCs, CD4 + memory T cells, and CD8 + memory T cells have been correlated with long-lived protection ( Amanna et al., 2007 6. Amanna, I.J. ∙ Carlson, N.E. ∙ Slifka, M.K. Duration of humoral immunity to common viral and vaccine antigens N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 :1903-1915 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ; Plotkin, 2010 34. Plotkin, S.A. Correlates of protection induced by vaccination Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17 :1055-1065 Crossref Scopus (1231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we do not yet know which components of immune memory are sufficient for protection from a second exposure to SARS-CoV-2, these components should synergize to form a multi-layered defense.
To determine if the CoV2 + individuals in our cohort each formed and maintained multiple immune memory components, we assessed each individual across components of SARS-CoV-2-specific functional immune memory that were significantly different in CoV2 + individuals at Visit 2 and, thus, might influence protection from a second exposure. The HC and CoV2 + individuals were grouped by infection status, and the values for independent metrics of immune memory at Visit 2 were reported in a heatmap ( Figure 5 ). Because we do not yet know what a protective threshold is for each of these metrics, we set one SD above the mean of the values from HCs for each metric (row) as a threshold (white on the color scale). This allows us to see which CoV2 + individuals had responses above those detected in HCs. All 14 CoV2 + individuals in our cohort formed and sustained multiple components of immune memory at Visit 2 at levels above those found in HCs. All but one CoV2 + individual (CoV2 + 8) had higher RBD-specific IgG + antibody titers, improved plasma inhibition of RBD-ACE2 binding, and higher numbers of RBD-specific IgG + MBCs than HCs. Most CoV2 + individuals (11/14) also maintained higher numbers of spike-responsive CD4 + memory T cells that could rapidly produce effector cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ, and/or IL-17A) than HCs. A few CoV2 + individuals (5/14) also had higher numbers of spike-responsive, IFN-γ-producing CD8 + memory T cells than did HCs. Together these data demonstrate that all of the CoV2 + individuals in our cohort formed and maintained multiple components of functional, adaptive immune memory.

Section: Discussion

Although a vaccine is needed to safely reach herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2, understanding if natural infection induces viral-specific immunological memory that could influence transmission and disease severity is critical to controlling this pandemic. We therefore investigated whether individuals that experienced mild COVID-19 developed and sustained multilayered, functional immune memory. We found that 3 months after mildly symptomatic COVID-19, recovered individuals had formed an expanded arsenal of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory cells that exhibited protective antiviral functions. Recovered individuals had increased neutralizing antibodies, IgG + classical MBCs with BCRs that formed neutralizing antibodies, Th1 cytokine-producing CXCR5 + circulating Tfh and CXCR5 − non-Tfh cells, proliferating CXCR3 + CD4 + memory cells, and IFN-γ-producing CD8 + T cells. These components of immune memory have all been associated with protection from other viruses in humans ( Ahmed and Gray, 1996 2. Ahmed, R. ∙ Gray, D. Immunological memory and protective immunity: understanding their relation Science. 1996; 272 :54-60 Crossref Scopus (1483) PubMed Google Scholar ; Amanna et al., 2007 6. Amanna, I.J. ∙ Carlson, N.E. ∙ Slifka, M.K. Duration of humoral immunity to common viral and vaccine antigens N. Engl. J.

Human blood CXCR5(+)CD4(+) T cells are counterparts of T follicular cells and contain specific subsets that differentially support antibody secretion Immunity. 2011; 34 :108-121 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1004) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these data demonstrate that all of the recovered individuals in our cohort formed a multifaceted defense, which suggests attenuated virus vaccines are likely to be similarly successful in eliciting a functional immune memory response.
Sustained production of neutralizing IgG + virus-specific antibodies is a frequent correlate of protection from viral infection ( Amanna et al., 2007 6. Amanna, I.J. ∙ Carlson, N.E. ∙ Slifka, M.K. Duration of humoral immunity to common viral and vaccine antigens N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 :1903-1915 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some studies examining the longevity of the antibody response to coronaviruses have suggested that antibodies wane rapidly ( Seow et al., 2020 45. Seow, J. ∙ Graham, C. ∙ Merrick, B. ...

Duration of antibody responses after severe acute respiratory syndrome Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2007; 13 :1562-1564 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study, as well as other recent studies, has examined memory time points when only LLPCs, and not short-lived PBs, are thought to be producing circulating antibodies. Together, we demonstrate elevated IgG + RBD-specific plasma antibodies and neutralizing plasma are generated and maintained at elevated levels for at least 3 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Isho et al., 2020 17. Isho, B. ∙ Abe, K.T. ∙ Zuo, M. ...

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust, neutralizing antibody responses that are stable for at least three months medRxiv. 2020; 2020.2007.2014.20151126 Google Scholar ).What level of antibody is needed to contribute to protection and whether that level will be maintained in the long term will require studies of later time points. Although we detected IgA + RBD-specific antibodies early, the levels had dropped significantly by 3 months, suggesting that the early IgA was derived from short-lived PBs. IgA-producing LLPCs either do not form or are sequestered in a tissue such that antibodies are not secreted into the blood.
Functional virus-specific memory B and T cells are key mediators of protective immune memory ( Plotkin, 2010 34. Plotkin, S.A. Correlates of protection induced by vaccination Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17 :1055-1065 Crossref Scopus (1231) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, unlike LLPCs, can be directly measured. Although previous studies have described the emergence of SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs within a month of infection ( Grifoni et al., 2020 13. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ... Targets of T Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus in Humans with COVID-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals Cell. 2020; 181 :1489-1501.e15, e1415 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2560) PubMed Google Scholar ; Juno et al., 2020 18. Juno, J.A. ∙ Tan, H.X. ∙ Lee, W.S. ... Humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell responses in recovered patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1428-1434 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ), ( Wilson et al., 2020 58. Wilson, P. ∙ Stamper, C. ∙ Dugan, H. ... Distinct B cell subsets give rise to antigen-specific antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 Res Sq. 2020; rs.3.rs-80476 Google Scholar ) we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs at 1 and 3 months from symptom onset in the same individuals to determine whether this population is maintained. Our study also analyzed additional attributes of MBCs that have been associated with anti-viral protection. Our study revealed a prominent population of RBD-specific IgG + CD27 + CD21 + MBCs, which, in other infections, has been associated with GC derivation, rapid differentiation into antibody-secreting PBs upon re-exposure ( Nellore et al., 2019 31. Nellore, A. ∙ Scharer, C.D. ∙ King, R.G. ... Fcrl5 and T-bet define influenza-specific memory B cells that predict long-lived antibody responses bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and effective antiviral responses ( Rubtsova et al., 2013 39. Rubtsova, K. ∙ Rubtsov, A.V. ∙ van Dyk, L.F. ... T-box transcription factor T-bet, a key player in a unique type of B-cell activation essential for effective viral clearance Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :E3216-E3224 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Not only was this population maintained from 1 to 3 months, the numbers increased significantly. We also found that these cells express BCRs capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 when expressed as monoclonal antibodies. Approximately half of the antibodies derived from the IgG + MBCs analyzed were able to neutralize the virus in vitro . The BCRs all exhibited SHM, and the number of mutations from Visit 1 BCRs was similar to those previously reported from samples obtained at a similar time point ( Robbiani et al., 2020 38. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). SHM modestly increased in both heavy and light chains from Visit 1 to Visit 2, which could reflect additional affinity maturation in the GC, but further analysis of a larger numbers of samples is needed. Taken together, these data suggest that upon re-exposure with SARS-CoV-2, these individuals will have MBCs that can rapidly generate neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and help control the infection.
Memory CD4 + T cells can help reactivate MBCs through their expression of key molecules associated with T-B interactions including CXCR5, ICOS, CD40L, and a variety of cytokines ( Vinuesa et al., 2016 54. Vinuesa, C.G. ∙ Linterman, M.A. ∙ Yu, D. ... Follicular Helper T Cells Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34 :335-368 Crossref Scopus (799) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + memory T cells in recovered individuals in our cohort exhibited the capacity to express all of these molecules and to undergo robust proliferation upon re-exposure to spike protein. Notably, spike-specific CD4 + memory T cells from CoV2 + individuals rapidly displayed increased levels of ICOS and CD40L on CXCR5 + and CXCR5 – cells after stimulation as well as expression of Th1- and Th17-associated cytokines. These results are consistent with other recent reports of SARS-CoV-2-specific cTfh cells ( Juno et al., 2020 18. Juno, J.A. ∙ Tan, H.X. ∙ Lee, W.S. ... Humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell responses in recovered patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1428-1434 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ), although they detected a high frequency of Th17-like cTfh cells, which could be due to the earlier time point they were examining as Th17 cells can develop into Th1 cells late in an immune response ( Lee et al., 2009 26. Lee, Y.K. ∙ Turner, H. ∙ Maynard, C.L. ... Late developmental plasticity in the T helper 17 lineage Immunity. 2009; 30 :92-107 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (853) PubMed Google Scholar ). The expression of IFN-γ and IL-17 by cTfh cells is notable as these cytokines are associated with class switching to IgG and IgA isotypes, respectively ( Hirota et al., 2013 15. Hirota, K. ∙ Turner, J.E. ∙ Villa, M. ... Plasticity of Th17 cells in Peyer’s patches is responsible for the induction of T cell-dependent IgA responses Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peng et al., 2002 32. Peng, S.L. ∙ Szabo, S.J. ∙ Glimcher, L.H. T-bet regulates IgG class switching and pathogenic autoantibody production Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :5545-5550 Crossref Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also likely found cross-reactive memory B and T cells in healthy controls. In response to a viral infection, B cells that could recognize a viral antigen, but did not enter a GC, predominantly form IgM + and IgD + MBCs which tend to be low affinity and do not rapidly form PBs upon re-exposure, but might be able to recognize a variant of the viral protein ( Weisel and Shlomchik, 2017 57. Weisel, F. ∙ Shlomchik, M. Memory B Cells of Mice and Humans Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35 :255-284 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because we detected RBD-specific IgM + and IgD + MBCs in HCs, we hypothesize that some of these could be cross-reactive MBCs generated in response to a previous human coronavirus infection as recent work suggests ( Song et al., 2020 50. Song, G. ∙ He, W.T. ∙ Callaghan, S. ... Cross-reactive serum and memory B cell responses to spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronavirus infection bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.09.22.308965 Google Scholar ). We also found a small number of spike-responsive CD4 + memory T cells in HCs, which other groups have similarly attributed to cross-reactive memory T cells potentially associated with a previous human coronavirus infection ( Braun et al., 2020 8. Braun, J. ∙ Loyal, L. ∙ Frentsch, M. ... SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in healthy donors and patients with COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 587 :270-274 Crossref Scopus (851) PubMed Google Scholar ; Grifoni et al., 2020 13. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ... Targets of T Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus in Humans with COVID-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals Cell. 2020; 181 :1489-1501.e15, e1415 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2560) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sekine et al., 2020 44. Sekine, T. ∙ Perez-Potti, A. ∙ Rivera-Ballesteros, O. ..., Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group Robust T Cell Immunity in Convalescent Individuals with Asymptomatic or Mild COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 183 :158-168.e14, e114 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sette and Crotty, 2020 46. Sette, A. ∙ Crotty, S. Pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2: the knowns and unknowns Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :457-458 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also found SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + memory T cells in equal numbers in HCs and CoV2 + individuals. This finding suggests cross-reactivity within a population of IFN-γ producing CD8 + memory cells in our HC samples and raises the possibility that our inability to interrogate CD8 + resident memory cells in the lungs could mask the true expansion of this compartment in CoV2 + individuals. How these cross-reactive cells contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 memory response in recovered individuals is difficult to discern without knowledge of each individual’s SARS-CoV-2-specific BCR and TCR repertoires prior to infection. However, we can conclude that mild COVID-19 induces an expanded population of MBCs and CD4 + memory T cells with markers of increased functionality in comparison with the cross-reactive pool present in our controls.
It is currently impossible to perform controlled SARS-CoV-2 reinfection studies to test the protective capacity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes we have described in humans. However, previous studies of human coronaviruses have shown protection from homologous rechallenge that correlated with antibody titers ( Callow et al., 1990 9. Callow, K.A. ∙ Parry, H.F. ∙ Sergeant, M. ... The time course of the immune response to experimental coronavirus infection of man Epidemiol. Infect. 1990; 105 :435-446 Crossref Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although studies of SARS-CoV-2 have confirmed rare second exposures months after the first, they suggest prior exposure can be protective ( Abu-Raddad, 2020 62. Abu-Raddad, L.J. ... Assessment of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in an intense reexposure setting medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; To et al., 2020 53. To, K. ∙ Hung, I. ∙ Ip, J.D. ... Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reinfectionby a phylogenetically distinct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strainconfirmed by whole genome sequencing Clin. Inf. Dis. 2020; Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar ). Additional studies have supported this finding, including evidence from a fishing vessel where 85% of the crew became infected, yet 3 previously exposed individuals with neutralizing antibodies did not get sick ( Addetia et al., 2020 1. Addetia, A. ∙ Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Dingens, A. ... Neutralizing Antibodies Correlate with Protection from SARS-CoV-2 in Humans during a Fishery Vessel Outbreak with a High Attack Rate J. Clin. Microbiology. 2020; 58 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recently, during an outbreak at an overnight camp, none of the attendees that were seropositive (16%) prior to attending the camp tested positive for infection, whereas 91% of the remaining susceptible population tested positive for infection ( Pray, 2020 35. Pray, I.W. ... COVID-19 Outbreak at an Overnight Summer School Retreat Wisconsin, July-August 2020. MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report. 2020; 69 :1600-1604 Google Scholar ). Animal studies provide additional support, as macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from rechallenge ( Chandrashekar, 2020 10. Chandrashekar, A. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against rechallenge in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :812-817 Crossref Scopus (630) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these studies support the role of immune memory contributing to protection from SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure, future studies will require data on the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory compartment prior to re-exposure to assess a correlation to protection.
It is also important to note that different levels of severity of COVID-19 could be associated with different levels of immune memory and subsequent immune protection. We focused on the immune memory response to mild COVID-19, but whether similar memory populations form after severe COVID-19 is still unclear. In one largely histological study of post-mortem tissues from patients that succumbed to severe COVID-19, the lack of GC formation or the generation of CD4 + Tfh lymphocytes required for an optimal immune memory response suggested that forming immune memory could be difficult ( Kaneko et al., 2020 19. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.H. ∙ Boucau, J. ..., Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness Specimen Working Group Loss of Bcl-6-Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and Germinal Centers in COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 183 :143-157.e13, e113 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, as these patients died of acute disease, it is impossible to determine if germinal centers were transiently disrupted due to acute inflammation as has been seen in other highly inflammatory diseases like malaria ( Keitany, 2016 20. Keitany, G.J. ... Blood Stage Malaria Disrupts Humoral Immunity to the Pre- erythrocytic Stage Circumsporozoite Protein Cell Reports. 2016; 17 :3193-3205 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although additional studies are needed to determine how long memory to SARS-CoV-2 infection lasts, our work suggests that mild COVID-19 induces persistent, multifaceted immune memory. These functional antiviral memory lymphocytes are poised for a coordinated response to SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure that could contribute to immunity and help to curtail the pandemic.
First, our cohort is of relatively small size, preventing us from identifying patient characteristics that correlate with maintained immune memory. We would need a larger cohort with a diverse racial make-up as well as details on disease characteristics to achieve this. Second, we restricted our cohort to individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19. Thus, these data do not describe the immune memory response after asymptomatic or severe disease. Studying a larger cohort of individuals with a spectrum of disease severity would allow this extension of our data. Third, we found SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory was maintained at 3 months post-symptom onset, but we do not know whether SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory will be maintained for a year or longer. Repeating these studies at later time points will yield these data. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory is maintained and functional in vitro , but our data cannot say whether these individuals will be protected from disease upon a second exposure and, if they are, which arms of immune memory correlate with protection. Addressing this will require study of individuals before and after a natural re-exposure event. Large epidemiologic studies to determine whether the rate of symptomatic re-infection in previously exposed individuals is different than in naive individuals will also help address whether previous exposure and immune memory generation could be protective from symptomatic re-infection.

The published article includes all datasets generated or analyzed during this study and no code was generated.
This study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (Gale Lab, IRB 00009810). Informed consent was obtained from all enrolled participants. Samples were de-identified prior to transfer to the Pepper Lab.
The study was conceptualized utilizing a case-control design. Cases and controls were identified from a cross-sectional cohort study that recruited via print and online advertising from the Seattle metropolitan area ( Table 1 ). Cases (CoV2 + , n = 15) were selected based on a reported history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal swab. Controls (n = 17) were selected based on having no prior positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal swab and having no detectable SARS-CoV-2 RBD- or S-specific IgG or IgM plasma antibodies (within mean + 3 SD of 5 de-identified plasma samples drawn prior to 2020 generously donated by Wesley C. Van Voorhis). At the time of enrollment, information was collected from all participants regarding recent illness symptoms and severity. All CoV2 + cases reported at least one symptom, but all were classified as mild disease, as none required hospitalization.
10-50 mL of venous blood from study volunteers were collected in EDTA tubes and spun at 1500xg for 10 min. Plasma was collected, heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min, aliquoted and stored at −80°C. The cellular fraction was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and PBMC were separated from red blood cells using Sepmate PBMC Isolation Tubes (STEMCELL Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instruction and frozen at −80°C before being stored in liquid nitrogen. PBMCs were thawed at 37°C and washed twice before use.
The SARS-CoV-2 S B (BEI NR-52422) construct was synthesized by GenScript into pcDNA3.1- with an N-terminal mu-phosphatase signal peptide and a C-terminal octa-histidine tag (GHHHHHHHH). The boundaries of the construct are N- 328 RFPN 331 and C- 528 KKST 531 . The SARS-CoV-2 S-2P ectodomain trimer (GenBank: YP_009724390.1 , BEI NR-52420; cite PMID https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32155444/ ) was synthesized by GenScript into pCMV with an N-terminal mu-phosphatase signal peptide and a C-terminal TEV cleavage site (GSGRENLYPQG), T4 fibritin foldon (GGGSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTPL), and octa-histidine tag (GHHHHHHHH). The construct contains the 2P mutations (proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987; PMID https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28807998/ ) and an 682 SGAG 685 substitution at the furin cleavage site. A pCAGGS vector containing the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate) was generously provided by Florian Krammer ( Amanat et al., 2020 5. Amanat, F. ∙ Stadlbauer, D. ∙ Strohmeier, S. ... A serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1033-1036 Crossref Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Constructs were produced in Expi293F cells grown in suspension using Expi293F expression medium (Life technologies) at 33°C, 70% humidity, and 8% CO 2 rotating at 150 rpm. The cultures were transfected using PEI-MAX (Polyscience) with cells grown to a density of 3.0 million cells per mL and cultivated for 3 days. Supernatants was clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 4000 rcf), addition of PDADMAC solution to a final concentration of 0.0375% (Sigma Aldrich, #409014), and a second spin (5 min at 4000 rcf).
Proteins were purified from clarified supernatants via a batch bind method where each supernatant was supplemented with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 45 mM and 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of ∼310 mM). Talon cobalt affinity resin (Takara) was added to the treated supernatants and allowed to incubate for 15 min with gentle shaking. Resin was collected using vacuum filtration using a 0.2 μm filter and transferred to a gravity column. The resin was washed with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted with three column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl. The batch bind process was then repeated and the first and second elutions combined. SDS-PAGE was used to assess purity. Purified S-2P trimer was concentrated to ∼1 mg/mL and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% L-histidine, 5% glycerol in a hydrated 10k molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Thermo Scientific). The purified RBD protein was dialyzed into 50 mM Tris pH 7, 185 mM NaCl, 100 mM arginine, 4.5% glycerol, 0.75% w/v CHAPS. Due to inherent instability, S-2P was immediately flash frozen and stored at −80°C.
Recombinant trimeric spike and the RBD domain were both biotinylated using an EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotinylation Kit (ThermoFisher), tetramerized with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE) (Agilent) and stored in 50% glycerol at −20°C as previously described 17 . Decoy reagent was generated by tetramerizing an irrelevant biotinylated protein with SA-PE previously conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 using an Alexa Fluor 647 Antibody Labeling Kit (ThermoFisher).
96-well plates (Corning) were coated with 2 ug/mL of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD or trimeric spike protein diluted in PBS and incubated at 4°C overnight. Plates were washed with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS-T and 3% milk) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Plasma, culture supernatants or monoclonal antibodies were serially diluted in dilution buffer (PBS-T and 1% milk) in triplicate, added to plates, and incubated at RT for 2 h. Secondary antibodies were diluted in dilution buffer as follows: anti-human IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:3000, anti-human IgM-HRP (Southern Biotech) at 1:3000, or anti-human IgA-HRP (Southern Biotech) at 1:1500. Plates were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT, then detected with 1X 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Invitrogen) and quenched with 1M HCl. Sample optical density (OD) was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450nm and 570nm. CR3022, a human SARS-CoV antibody previously determined to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 was used as a positive control. IgG in culture supernatants was measured using a Human IgG ELISA Kit (Stemcell) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data was analyzed in Prism (GraphPad).
sVNT assays were performed as previously described ( Tan et al., 2020 51. Tan, C.W. ∙ Chia, W.N. ∙ Qin, X. ... A SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test based on antibody-mediated blockage of ACE2-spike protein-protein interaction Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1073-1078 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ), Briefly, high-binding 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with 5 ug/mL of recombinant human ACE2-Fc diluted in 100mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated at 4°C overnight. Plates were washed with PBS-T and incubated with blocking buffer (3% milk in PBS-T) for 1 h at RT. Plasma or monoclonal antibody supernatants were serially diluted in triplicate in dilution buffer (1% milk in PBS-T) and incubated with 18ng of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD-HRP (conjugated using Abcam HRP conjugation kit) for 1 h at 37°C. Blocked plates were washed and incubated with the pre-incubated plasma/antibody and RBD-HRP for 1 h at RT, then detected with TMB and 1M HCl. OD was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450nm and 570nm. RBD-HRP alone and plasma with no RBD-HRP incubation were used as controls. The percent inhibition was calculated as (1 – Sample OD value/Average Negative Control OD value) x 100. Data was analyzed in Prism (GraphPad).
PRNT assays were performed as previously described ( Erasmus et al., 2020 12. Erasmus, J.H. ∙ Khandhar, A.P. ∙ Walls, A.C. ... Single-dose replicating RNA vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.05.28.121640 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, heat inactivated plasma was diluted 1:5 followed by four 4-fold serial dilutions and monoclonal antibodies were diluted 1:10 followed by 4 10-fold serial dilution and mixed 1:1 with 600 PFU/mL SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 (BEI resources) in PBS+0.3% cold water fish skin gelatin (Sigma). After 30 min of incubation at 37°C, the plasma/virus mixtures were added to 12 well plates of Vero cells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, rocking every 15 min. All dilutions were done in duplicate, along with virus only and no virus controls. Plates were then washed with PBS and overlaid with a 1:1 mixture of 2.4% Avicel RC-591 (FMC) and 2X MEM (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 4% heat-inactivated FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin (Fisher Scientific.) After a 48 h incubation, the overlay was removed, plates were washed with PBS, fixed with 10% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 30 min at room temp and stained with 1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 20% EtOH. Percent neutralization was calculated as (1 – # sample plaques/# positive control plaques) x 100. Data was analyzed in Prism (GraphPad) and IC 50 was calculated by sigmoidal interpolation method.
Thawed PBMCs were first stained with decoy tetramer and then with RBD tetramer prior to incubation with anti-PE magnetic beads and magnetic bead enrichment (Miltenyi Biotec) as previously described. 17 Bound cells were stained with surface antibodies and, if required, were fixed/permeabilized using eBioscience FoxP3 Fix/Perm kit (ThermoFisher) for 30 min, followed by incubation with intracellular antibodies. Stained samples were run on a LSRII flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo (Becton Dickinson). Samples with less than 5 RBD-specific MBCs were removed from summary data for proportional phenotyping (surface stain V1: 2, surface stain V2: 1, intracellular stain V1: 4, intracellular stain V2: 3). For B cells sorting experiments, single tetramer-specific B cells were indexed sorted on a FACSAriaII cell sorter and collected in a 96-well PCR plate containing SMART-Seq v4 capture buffer (Takara Bio).
For surface phenotyping, total PBMCs (innate cells) or PBMCs from the negative fraction of the antigen-specific B Cell magnetic columns (for lymphocytes) were washed and incubated with fluorescently conjugated antibodies. Staining for cTfh analyses were performed as follows: chemokine-receptors and transcription factors (40 min, RT), surface antigens (20 min, 4°C). Intracellular staining was performed using eBioscience FoxP3 Fix/Perm kit (ThermoFisher). For detection of intracellular cytokine production, PBMC were stimulated with 50 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μg/mL Ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) with 10 μg/mL Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1x dose GolgiStop/monensin (Becton Dickinson) for 4 h. Permeabilization and fixation was performed using Cytofix/Cytoperm (Becton Dickinson). Intracellular stains were performed for 30 min at 4°C. Flow cytometry analysis of innate immune populations was done on 0.5-1 million PBMCs before fraction isolation. Data was acquired on a Cytek Aurora or BD LSR Fortessa and analyzed using FlowJo10 software (Becton Dickinson).
PBMCs from the negative fraction of antigen-specific B Cell magnetic columns were washed and resuspended to 4x10 6 cells/mL with complete RPMI with 10mM HEPES (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2-Mercaptoethanol, Pen-Strep, and L-Glutamine. Spike-stimulated PBMCs were incubated with 2ug/mL full-length recombinant spike protein resuspended in PBS + 5% glycerol. Unstimulated controls received equivalent volume of PBS + 5% glycerol vehicle. Both conditions were left for 20 h at 37°C, 5%–8% CO2, with addition of 10 μg/mL Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1x dose GolgiStop/monensin (Becton Dickinson) for the final 5 h to allow for intracellular detection of cytokines. Positive controls were stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin (see above) for 5 h in the presence of Brefeldin-A and Monensin. Staining was performed as follows: chemokine-receptors (40 min, RT), surface antigens and cytokines (20 min, 4°C). Cells were run on the Cytek Aurora and analyzed using FlowJo (Becton Dickenson).
Starting with PBMC from healthy control or CoV2 + individuals, cell proliferation dye (CPD)-labeled, 1.25uM (ThermoFisher5), sorted naive or memory T cell subsets (5 × 10 4 ) were co-cultured in round-bottomed 96-well plates with irradiated autologous monocytes (5000 rads, 5 × 10 4 ), and provided either full-length recombinant human spike protein (2.5ug/mL) resuspended in 5% PBS-glycerol or vehicle control. Cultures were supplemented with 5U/mL recombinant human IL-2 (Biolegend; 589104). Cellular proliferation was assessed after 5-6 days by flow cytometry as above and analyzed using FlowJo10 (Becton Dickenson). The percentage of CXCR3 + CPD lo cells (defined as cells that had undergone 3 or more divisions) represented as Spike - Vehicle is calculated by subtracting the vehicle control proliferation from spike-treated proliferation.
Amplification of cDNA was performed using SMART-Seq v4 (Takara Bio) at half reaction volume for each sorted cell. B cell receptor (BCR) chains were amplified in a multiplex PCR using half reactions of DreamTaq (Thermo Fisher) and 1.25 ul of resulting cDNA with 3' primers for constant regions of IgM, IgA, (5′-GGAAGGAAGTCCTGTGCGAGGC-3′, 5′-GGAAGAAGCCCTGGACCAGGC-3′, ) ( Wardemann and Busse, 2019 63.

Rapid generation of fully human monoclonal antibodies specific to a vaccinating antigen Nature protocols. 2009; 4 :372-384 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar )) and a 5′ primer for the template switch sequence (5′-GTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATGGG-3′). Thermocycler conditions were 95°C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 57°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min. Resulting PCR products were cleaned using 5 ul of PCR reaction, 1 ul FastAP (Thermo Fisher), and 0.5 ul Exonuclease I (ThermoFisher) for 30 min at 37°C and inactivated at 75°C for 15 min. Sanger sequencing for each purified sample was performed using each 3′ primer from the previous BCR PCR amplification. Sequences were trimmed at Q30 using Geneious and submitted to IMGT/HighV-QUEST for alignment ( Alamyar, 2012 3. Alamyar, E. ... IMGT(®) tools for the nucleotide analysis of immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) V-(D)-J repertoires, polymorphisms, and IG mutations: IMGT/V-QUEST and IMGT/HighV-QUEST for NGS. Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.) 882(Chapter. 2012; 32 :569-604 Google Scholar ). Primers were designed using 5′ and 3′ cDNA sequence for In-Fusion Cloning Kit and performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. If a 5′ or 3′ sequence was missing, then the closest matching IMGT germline sequence was used for primer design. Heavy chains were inserted into IgG1 vectors, kappa and lambda chains were cloned into vectors with their respective constant regions ( Smith, 2009 49. Smith, K. ... Rapid generation of fully human monoclonal antibodies specific to a vaccinating antigen Nature protocols. 2009; 4 :372-384 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cloned plasmids were sequenced and screened by ensuring sequences of chains matched original cDNA sequence.
For small scale transfections, 12 well plates of 293T cells at 80% confluence were transiently transfected with 0.5ug each of heavy and light chain vectors using polyethylenimine (PEI). After 16 h, media was removed and replaced with serum-free media. After 3-4 days, supernatants were harvested and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at max speed in a microcentrifuge for 1 min. For large scale transfections, expression vectors containing paired heavy and light chains were transiently transfected into 293T cells using PEI. Expression of recombinant full-length human IgG monoclonal antibodies were carried out in serum-free basal medium (Nutridoma - SP, Sigma-Aldrich). Four days after transfection, cell culture medium was collected and protein was purified using HiTrap™ Protein G HP column (1ml, GE Healthcare). Final IgG proteins were concentrated and buffer exchanged into 1x PBS using Millipore concentrator (30K MWCO). IgG protein concentration is determined by Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer.
Statistics are described in figure legends and were determined using Prism (Graphpad). All measurements within a group are from distinct samples except technical replicates used in ELISAs as described. Statistical significance of all pairwise comparisons was assessed by two-tailed nonparametric tests; Mann-Whitney for unpaired data and Wilcoxon signed rank tests for paired data. Raw p values are displayed and the adjusted p value significance cutoff calculated from the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction with FDR = 0.05 for each figure is listed in the corresponding legend.
