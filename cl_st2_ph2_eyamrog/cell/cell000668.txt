Title: A general chemical principle for creating closure-stabilizing integrin inhibitors


Abstract: Summary

Integrins are validated drug targets with six approved therapeutics. However, small-molecule inhibitors to three integrins failed in late-stage clinical trials for chronic indications. Such unfavorable outcomes may in part be caused by partial agonism, i.e., the stabilization of the high-affinity, extended-open integrin conformation. Here, we show that the failed, small-molecule inhibitors of integrins αIIbβ3 and α4β1 stabilize the high-affinity conformation. Furthermore, we discovered a simple chemical feature present in multiple αIIbβ3 antagonists that stabilizes integrins in their bent-closed conformation. Closing inhibitors contain a polar nitrogen atom that stabilizes, via hydrogen bonds, a water molecule that intervenes between a serine residue and the metal in the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). Expulsion of this water is a requisite for transition to the open conformation. This change in metal coordination is general to integrins, suggesting broad applicability of the drug-design principle to the integrin family, as validated with a distantly related integrin, α4β1.

Section: Introduction

In time and with water, everything changes. —Leonardo da Vinci Integrins are attractive therapeutic targets with central functions in multiple diseases ( Cox et al., 2010 17.

Drug Discov. 2010; 9 :804-820 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ley et al., 2016 36. Ley, K. ∙ Rivera-Nieves, J. ∙ Sandborn, W.J. ...

Shimaoka, M. ∙ Springer, T.A. Therapeutic antagonists and the conformational regulation of integrin structure and function Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2 :703-716 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 24 integrin αβ heterodimers have evolved highly specialized functions. Antibodies to integrin α4β7/α4β1 and specific for α4β7 are approved for multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, respectively. Integrin ligand-binding pockets are unusually good binding sites for small molecules. Small molecules to the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 (αLβ2) and the fibrinogen receptor on platelets, integrin αIIbβ3, are approved topically for dry eye disease and acutely to prevent thrombosis, respectively. However, despite emergence of new targets, including integrins αVβ6 and αVβ8 in fibrosis and immuno-oncology, there are no approved chronic (oral) small-molecule integrin antagonists.
An intense pharmaceutical effort to develop oral antagonists of αIIbβ3 following the success of parenteral ligand mimetics ( Scarborough and Gretler, 2000 64. Scarborough, R.M. ∙ Gretler, D.D. Platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists as prototypical integrin blockers: novel parenteral and potential oral antithrombotic agents J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43 :3453-3473 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) was fueled by anticipation of “the dawn of a new era in antithrombotic therapy, the era of αIIbβ3 antagonism” ( Topol et al., 1999 72. Topol, E.J. ∙ Byzova, T.V. ∙ Plow, E.F. Platelet GPIIb-IIIa blockers Lancet. 1999; 353 :227-231 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (521) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, oral integrin antagonists ( Chew et al., 2001 14. Chew, D.P. ∙ Bhatt, D.L. ∙ Sapp, S. ...

Théroux, P. ∙ Catella-Lawson, F. ∙ Armstrong, P. ... Inhibition of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor with tirofiban in unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338 :1488-1497 Crossref Scopus (1677) PubMed Google Scholar ), were beset with massive failure. Five phase III trials of oral αIIbβ3 inhibitors in a total of 42,530 patients failed ( Chew et al., 2001 14. Chew, D.P. ∙ Bhatt, D.L. ∙ Sapp, S. ... Increased mortality with oral platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists: a meta-analysis of phase III multicenter randomized trials Circulation. 2001; 103 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ; Topol et al., 2003 73.

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international trial of the oral IIb/IIIa antagonist lotrafiban in coronary and cerebrovascular disease Circulation. 2003; 108 :399-406 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). In all trials, mortality was significantly higher in treated patients than in the placebo control, although the need for urgent revascularization was significantly reduced. Mortality was lessened by concurrent aspirin treatment, suggesting that platelet-mediated events were responsible for the bad outcome. The contrast between the benefit of short-term and harm of long-term αIIbβ3 therapy was striking and suggested “the presence of clinically relevant ‘toxic’ mechanisms” ( Chew et al., 2001 14. Chew, D.P. ∙ Bhatt, D.L. ∙ Sapp, S. ... Increased mortality with oral platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists: a meta-analysis of phase III multicenter randomized trials Circulation. 2001; 103 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The reason for these failures appeared to stem, at least in part, from agonism derived from integrin conformational change ( Aga et al., 2004 3. Aga, Y. ∙ Baba, K. ∙ Tam, S. ...

Most integrins, including αIIbβ3, are present predominantly in a low-affinity, bent-closed (BC) conformation on cell surfaces but change to a high-affinity extended-open (EO) state when bound to their biological ligands ( Frelinger et al., 1988 27.

A known complication of αIIbβ3 antagonism is pre-existing or drug exposure-stimulated production of antibodies to integrin conformational epitopes or ligand-induced binding sites (LIBSs) ( Bosco et al., 2005 9. Bosco, A. ∙ Kidson-Gerber, G. ∙ Dunkley, S. Delayed tirofiban-induced thrombocytopenia: two case reports J. Thromb.

After the phase III failures, αIIbβ3 antagonist research and development was shut down, and publications in the field greatly declined.
Thus, the story of how a just-emerging class of αIIbβ3 antagonist worked—which did not induce LIBS—was never told. Several inhibitors were published as non-LIBS inducers, but how they were discovered and the chemical properties that differentiated them from LIBS inducers were not described ( Aga et al., 2004 3. Aga, Y. ∙ Baba, K. ∙ Tam, S. ... UR-3216: a new generation oral platelet GPIIb/IIIa antagonist Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10 :1597-1601 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ; Baba et al., 2001 8.

Differential antiplatelet effects of various glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists Thromb. Res. 2001; 101 :53-64 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, development of αIIbβ3 antagonists was stopped prior to their first structures bound to αIIbβ3, which were all with LIBS inducers ( Xiao et al., 2004 80. Xiao, T. ∙ Takagi, J. ∙ Coller, B.S. ... Structural basis for allostery in integrins and binding of fibrinogen-mimetic therapeutics Nature. 2004; 432 :59-67 Crossref Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ). A subsequently developed LIBS-inducing integrin αVβ3 inhibitor also failed in clinical trials in cancer and was suggested to be agonistic ( Ley et al., 2016 36. Ley, K. ∙ Rivera-Nieves, J. ∙ Sandborn, W.J. ... Integrin-based therapeutics: biological basis, clinical use and new drugs Nat. Rev.

Stimulation of tumor growth and angiogenesis by low concentrations of RGD-mimetic integrin inhibitors Nat. Med. 2009; 15 :392-400 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although non-LIBS-inducing αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 inhibitors have been reported by academic investigators, they have not been extended to integrins with other β-subunits ( Adair et al., 2020 1.

Med. 2012; 4 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar ).
A principle for inhibiting integrin conformational change by small-molecule antagonists that could be extended to integrins with other β-subunits would be desirable. Consider a dangerous safety signal with firategrast, a dual α4β1/α4β7 integrin antagonist, in a phase II trial in multiple sclerosis ( Miller et al., 2012 48. Miller, D.H. ∙ Weber, T. ∙ Grove, R. ... Firategrast for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Lancet Neurol. 2012; 11 :131-139 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). High doses were significantly beneficial, a medium dose had no significant effect, and a low dose was significantly harmful, a profile consistent with action of a partial agonist and induction of the active conformation of the integrin. However, little is known about firategrast, including whether it induces the high-affinity state of α4β1.
Here, we hypothesized that the rich chemical matter developed for αIIbβ3 antagonism could be used to uncover a chemical principle by which inhibitors could bind but not induce the high-affinity integrin state and that this principle might be broadly transferable to integrin targets of current clinical interest. We determined high-resolution structures of αIIbβ3 bound to opening-stabilizing (LIBS-inducing) and closure-stabilizing (non-LIBS-inducing) compounds. The key chemical principle to emerge, a hydrogen bond to a water molecule of importance in integrin conformational change, is elegant in its simplicity. Drug molecules that stabilize this water not only do not induce LIBS epitope expression but also suppress LIBS expression by stabilizing the closed, low-affinity integrin conformation.
To challenge our understanding of the chemical features required for closing inhibitors, we extrapolated what we learned from αIIbβ3 to the highly dissimilar integrin α4β1. We found that firategrast, which is no longer in pharmaceutical development, stabilizes the open, high-affinity integrin conformation. Searching the chemical literature for α4β1 antagonists, we found a pair of two compounds that were similar but differed in one position by the presence of a nitrogen atom able to hydrogen bond to water or a carbon atom lacking this ability; these compounds stabilized the closed and open states, respectively. This success and the invariance in integrin β-subunits of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) Mg 2+ ion and the MIDAS serine sidechain, between which the key water locates, suggest that the closing principle described here is likely extendable to all integrins.

Section: Results

Integrins on cell surfaces and as soluble ectodomain fragments equilibrate between three conformational states, BC, extended-closed (EC), and EO ( Figures 1 A and 1B). In the absence of ligand binding, the BC state predominates on cell surfaces: >99.8% for α5β1 and >97.7% for α4β1 ( Li and Springer, 2018 39. Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Energy landscape differences among integrins establish the framework for understanding activation J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :397-412 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Integrin αIIbβ3 is also predominately in the BC state in absence of ligand, as shown by lack of reactivity with LIBS antibodies ( Frelinger et al., 1988 27. Frelinger, A.L. ∙ Lam, S.C.T. ∙ Plow, E.F. ... Occupancy of an adhesive glycoprotein receptor modulates expression of an antigenic site involved in cell adhesion J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263 :12397-12402 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). LIBS antibodies to αIIbβ3 map to regions of the upper and lower legs ( Figure 1 A) that become exposed upon extension ( Byron et al., 2009 12. Byron, A. ∙ Humphries, J.D. ∙ Askari, J.A. ...

Modulation of integrin activation and signaling by α1/α1'-helix unbending at the junction J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :5735-5747 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Using multiple assays that extend to the end of results, we found that inhibitors either stabilized integrin headpiece opening, closure, or were conformationally neutral. Initially, we tested the effect of compounds on the integrin headpiece fragment, which is truncated at the knees ( Figure 1 A). The headpiece responds similarly to ligand-mimetic drugs as the ectodomain and intact integrins but has only two states, closed and open, and thus can directly demonstrate opening in the absence of extension. The integrin headpiece, as demonstrated with α5β1, is more stable in the closed state than the ectodomain and is thus more difficult to activate ( Li and Springer, 2017 38. Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Integrin extension enables ultrasensitive regulation by cytoskeletal force Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :4685-4690 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). In 1 mM Mg 2+ /1 mM Ca 2+ (Mg 2+ ), the clinically tested oral antagonists roxifiban ( Pieniaszek et al., 2002 61. Pieniaszek, Jr., H.J. ∙ Sy, S.K. ∙ Ebling, W. ...

Drugs studied here are shown in Figure 2 ; for convenience, we use oral prodrug names for their active forms. Mn 2+ increases integrin intrinsic affinity for ligand and also increases the population of the open state ( Anderson et al., 2022 5. Anderson, J.M. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A.

Conformational equilibria and intrinsic affinities define integrin activation EMBO J. 2017; 36 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). As shown by negative stain electron microscopy of detergent soluble, intact αIIbβ3, Mn 2+ increases population of the EC and EO states and, in presence of a ligand that binds to the open headpiece conformation, enhances population of the EO state ( Eng et al., 2011 24. Eng, E.T. ∙ Smagghe, B.J. ∙ Walz, T. ... Intact αIIbβ3 extends after activation measured by solution X-ray scattering and electron microscopy J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :35218-35226 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In gel filtration of the αIIbβ3 headpiece in absence of compound, 2 mM Mn 2+ /0.2 mM Ca 2+ (Mn 2+ ) increased the hydrodynamic radius slightly, from 4.77 in Mg 2+ to 4.88 nm in Mn 2+ , which suggested a slight increase in population in the ensemble of the open conformation ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and 1I). Although clinically tested lotrafiban, roxifiban, and tirofiban varied in the extent to which they shifted headpiece elution in Mg 2+ , they uniformly increased the hydrodynamic radius to ∼5.36 nm in Mn 2+ .

Murphy, N.P. ∙ Pratico, D. ∙ Fitzgerald, D.J. Functional relevance of the expression of ligand-induced binding sites in the response to platelet GP IIb/IIIa antagonists in vivo J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286 :945-951 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in activating Mn 2+ buffer, these three compounds induced headpiece opening as completely as tirofiban ( Figure 1 F). We term these “opening” inhibitors because they increase the proportion of the open state in conformational ensembles.
Another class of compounds did not induce opening in buffer with Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ . We found UR-2922 (Ube Pharmaceuticals), reported not to induce LIBS epitopes on platelets in Mg 2+ ( Baba et al., 2001 8. Baba, K. ∙ Aga, Y. ∙ Nakanishi, T. ... UR-3216: a manageable oral GPIIb/IIIa antagonist Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2001; 19 :25-40 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), in a review on integrin antagonists ( Cox et al., 2010 17. Cox, D. ∙ Brennan, M. ∙ Moran, N. Integrins as therapeutic targets: lessons and opportunities Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9 :804-820 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ). We later found BMS4, also reported not to induce LIBS on platelets in Mg 2+ ( Breth et al., 2005 11. Breth, L. ∙ Kochie, J. ∙ Combs, A. ... Identification and characterization of antibodies that bind GPIIb/IIIa: antagonist complexes J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 301 :11-20 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), during a serendipitous search for LIBS antibodies. We found that neither UR-2922 nor BMS4 increased the hydrodynamic radius of the αIIbβ3 headpiece in Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ( Figures 1 G and 1H). Furthermore, in Mn 2+ , these inhibitors shifted the headpiece to a smaller hydrodynamic radius than the control, which was indistinguishable from the control in Mg 2+ ( Figures 1 G–1I). These results are consistent with the suggestion above that a small population of the αIIbβ3 headpiece is in the open conformation in Mn 2+ and that these compounds preferentially bind to the closed conformation and increase its population. We term these “closing” inhibitors.
In the absence of ligand in Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ , αIIbβ3 headpiece-Fab complexes crystallize in the closed state with two molecules per asymmetric unit, giving two independent structural snapshots ( Zhu et al., 2013 87. Zhu, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Complete integrin headpiece opening in eight steps J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201 :1053-1068 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). The key early step in headpiece opening is movement of the loop between the βI domain β1-strand and α1-helix (β1-α1 loop, Figures 1 A and 1B), which bears three sidechains that coordinate the MIDAS metal ion in an Asp-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Ser (DXSXS) motif that is conserved in all integrin β-subunits. In previous work, we soaked Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide at different concentrations with Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ into αIIbβ3 crystals and trapped αIIbβ3 in closed state 1, intermediate states 2–7, or open state 8 ( Zhu et al., 2013 87. Zhu, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Complete integrin headpiece opening in eight steps J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201 :1053-1068 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). In state 1, the sidechain oxygen of Ser-123 in the MIDAS motif hydrogen bonds to water molecule 1 (W1 in Figures 3 A and 3B), whereas in states 3–8, movement of the β1-α1 loop repositions the Ser-123 sidechain oxygen to take the place of water 1 ( Figures 1 B and 3 C).
To test whether differences would emerge from comparisons of crystal structures of opening and closing inhibitors bound to αIIbβ3, we determined structures of 16 compounds soaked in the presence of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ , including 5 compounds soaked in both metal ion conditions. The 21 structures diffracted to 2.52 ± 0.26 Å and were refined to R free values of 23.21 ± 1.46 (mean ± SD) with excellent electron density for all drug atoms ( Figures 3 and S1 ; Figure S2 ; Table S1 ).

Structural basis for allostery in integrins and binding of fibrinogen-mimetic therapeutics Nature. 2004; 432 :59-67 Crossref Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ), lotrafiban, and EF-5154 in Mg 2+ and roxifiban in Mn 2+ bound in the αIIbβ3 groove with their Arg-mimetic nitrogen hydrogen bonded to αIIb residue Asp-224 and their Asp-mimetic carboxyl group coordinated to the β3 MIDAS metal ion ( Figures 3 D–3G; Figures S1 A–S1E and S2 A). Furthermore, β1-α1 loop movement brought the Tyr-122 backbone into position to hydrogen bond to the drug carboxyl group and Ser-123 displaced water 1 to coordinate directly to the MIDAS metal ion. These opening compounds thus acted similarly to RGD peptides. Three other opening compounds, lamifiban, sibrafiban, and fradafiban, did not cause any conformational change in Mg 2+ ( Figures 1 I and 3 H; Figures S1 F, S1H, S1J, S2 B, and S2D). In contrast, in Mn 2+ , they induced a 2 Å movement in the β1-α1 loop at the Cα atom of Ser-123 toward ligand and brought its sidechain oxygen within 2.3–2.7 Å of the MIDAS Mn 2+ ion, thus displacing and occupying the position of water 1 ( Figures 1 I, 3 I, and 3J; Figures S1 G, S1I, S1K, and S2 C). Moreover, movement also brought the backbone of Tyr-122 into position to form a hydrogen bond to the non-MIDAS coordinating carboxyl oxygen of the drug. 2F o -F c density maps at 1.5 σ near the βI domain MIDAS region clearly document displacement of the water by the Ser-123 sidechain ( Figures S1 F–S1K). These results agreed with increased headpiece hydrodynamic radius with lamifiban, sibrafiban, and fradafiban in solution in Mn 2+ but not in Mg 2+ ( Figure 1 I). We could identify no chemical properties or interactions such as hydrogen bonds with αIIbβ3 that uniquely distinguished the compounds that opened the headpiece in Mn 2+ and not in Mg 2+ ( Figures 3 D–3J and S2 A–S2D).
In contrast to the results with opening integrin inhibitors, soaking with UR-2922 and BMS4 caused no structural perturbation of the closed αIIbβ3 headpiece in Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ( Figures 3 K, 3L, S1 L–S1O, S2 E, and S2F). Seeing no unique structural contacts between the integrin and the closing inhibitors, we at first were puzzled by how they stabilized the closed state. During opening, integrin β1-α1 loop movement is linked to sliding of the entire RGD ligand in its binding groove toward Asp-224 in the αIIb subunit ( Figures 1 B, 3 B, and 3C; Zhu et al., 2013 87. Zhu, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Complete integrin headpiece opening in eight steps J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201 :1053-1068 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). We wondered if closing inhibitors might be longer and more rigid than RGD and block this movement. Pursuing this hypothesis, we synthesized a shorter BMS4 analog, BMS4-1, and the even shorter BMS4-3 ( Figure 2 ). Gel filtration showed that BMS4-1 and BMS4-3 were closure stabilizing ( Figures 1 G–1I). Crystal structures showed that αIIbβ3 remained in the closed state in Mn 2+ and bound to BMS4-1 and BMS4-3 essentially identically to BMS4, except that BMS4-3 was so shortened that its piperidine group did not reach αIIb Asp-244 and interacted with it through a network of water molecules ( Figures 3 M, 3N, S1 P, and S1Q). These results falsified the hypothesis that closing propensity of the BMS series was a function of compound length.
The inspirational moment finally came when we noticed that closing compounds either directly hydrogen bonded water 1 (W1), which bridges the MIDAS metal ion to the sidechain of MIDAS residue Ser-123 (UR-2922, Figure 3 K), or indirectly hydrogen bonded to water 1 through water 2 (W2) as in the case of BMS4, BMS4-3, and BMS4-1 ( Figures 3 L–3N). As water 1 is displaced by the Ser-123 sidechain early in integrin opening and in the final open state ( Xiao et al., 2004 80. Xiao, T. ∙ Takagi, J. ∙ Coller, B.S. ... Structural basis for allostery in integrins and binding of fibrinogen-mimetic therapeutics Nature. 2004; 432 :59-67 Crossref Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2013 87. Zhu, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Complete integrin headpiece opening in eight steps J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201 :1053-1068 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ), stabilizing water 1 specifically stabilizes the closed conformation.
UR-2922 has a pyrazole ring with two nitrogens, one of which (N2) hydrogen bonds to water 1 ( Figures 2 , 3 K, and 4 A). Neither nitrogen has a hydrogen. Thus, one of the hydrogens of water 1 donates a hydrogen bond to the electron lone pair of N2; in turn, one water 1 oxygen electron lone pair forms a partially covalent (2.1 Å) coordination to the MIDAS metal ion. The UR-2922 complex structures are virtually identical in Mn 2+ and Mg 2+ ( Figure 3 K; Figure S2 F) and have strong electron density for water 1 ( Figures 4 A, S1 L, and S1M).
The BMS4-bound structures in Mn 2+ and Mg 2+ and the BMS4-3 and BMS4-1 complexes in Mn 2+ all show strong density for both water 1 and water 2 ( Figures 4 B–4D and S1 N–S1Q). Density for water in a similar location to water 2 was not observed in any of the complexes with opening-stabilizing inhibitors or in UR-2922 complexes ( Figures 4 A and S1 A–S1K). The piperazine N1 atom is highly basic and is protonated (positively charged) at neutral pH. Thus, water 2 serves as a polarized hydrogen bond acceptor for the protonated piperazine nitrogen N1. Among the BMS4, BMS4-1, and BMS4-3 complex structures, three in Mn 2+ and one in Mg 2+ , each with two independent molecules in the crystal lattice, the strength of the piperazine N-water 2 and water 2-water 1 hydrogen bonds is evidenced by their short heavy atom distances of 2.79 ± 0.18 and 2.64 ± 0.11 (mean ± SD, n = 6), respectively.
These results define a fundamental chemical principle for designing closing integrin inhibitors: they include a polar atom in the compound that is positioned (1) to accept a hydrogen bond from water 1 or (2) to donate a hydrogen bond to water 2, which in turn accepts a hydrogen bond from water 1. The net effect is to stabilize water 1 and prevent its expulsion in integrin opening. These features are specific to closing inhibitors, since no hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, including water, are within 3.5 Å of the position occupied by water 1 in crystal structures of opening inhibitors including RGD ( Figures 3 B–3J, S1 A–S1K, and S2 A–S2D).
We challenged the chemical hypothesis by synthesizing BMS4-2, which substituted the piperazine N1 atom in BMS4-1 with a carbon atom ( Figure 2 ). BMS4-2 soaked into closed αIIbβ3 headpiece crystals in Mn 2+ shifted the molecules in the crystal lattice to state 2, in contrast to all closing inhibitors ( Figure 1 I). Water 1 remained between the MIDAS and Ser-123 sidechain ( Figure 3 O); however, Ser-123 moved closer to the MIDAS Mn 2+ ion with a distance of 3.7 ± 0.1 Å, whereas all closing inhibitors showed Ser-123-Mn 2+ distances of 4.2–4.4 Å ( Figure 1 I). Furthermore, there was no density for water 2 with BMS4-2 ( Figure 4 E). In gel filtration, BMS4-2 stabilized headpiece opening in Mn 2+ and not in Mg 2+ ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and 1I). As BMS4-1 and BMS4-2 differ by a single atom ( Figure 2 ), these results demonstrated that the piperazine N1 atom is essential for stabilizing the closed integrin state and for positioning water 2 to hydrogen bond to water 1.
Further αIIbβ3 inhibitors with piperazine or piperidine acetic acid moieties were found in review articles and using SciFinder ( scifinder.cas.org ). Gantofiban (EMD 122347, Merck KGA) is optimized for blocking platelet functions and oral bioavailability in guinea pigs ( Gante et al., 1995 28. Gante, J. ∙ Juraszyk, H. ∙ Raddatz, P. ... New peptidomimetics in the chemistry of fibrinogen receptor antagonists Lett. Pept. Sci. 1995; 2 :135-140 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ; Figure 2 ). Coincidentally, we later found that EMD 122347 had been reported to decrease LIBS exposure on platelets ( Dickfeld et al., 2001 20. Dickfeld, T. ∙ Ruf, A. ∙ Pogatsa-Murray, G. ... Differential antiplatelet effects of various glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists Thromb. Res. 2001; 101 :53-64 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although no results were published, gantofiban entered phase II clinical trials in Europe (Merck KGA) and Japan (Yamanouchi) ( https://adisinsight.springer.com ). We synthesized gantofiban, which is most active as the (R)-stereoisomer, and its analog with a one-carbon-longer carboxylic acid, which is most active as the (S)-stereoisomer ( Gante et al., 1995 28. Gante, J. ∙ Juraszyk, H. ∙ Raddatz, P. ... New peptidomimetics in the chemistry of fibrinogen receptor antagonists Lett. Pept. Sci. 1995; 2 :135-140 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ; Figure 2 ). Gantofiban does not induce headpiece opening in Mn 2+ ( Figure 1 H); however, its analog does in both Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Crystal soaking in Mn 2+ showed that gantofiban bound to αIIbβ3 without perturbing its structure and that its piperazine nitrogen hydrogen bonded to water 2 which in turn hydrogen bonded to water 1 ( Figure 3 P; Figure S1 S). In contrast, the gantofiban analog induced movement of the β1-α1 loop and Ser-123 sidechain oxygen into the position of water 1 and had no equivalent of water 2 ( Figures 3 Q and S1 T). Compared with gantofiban, the one-carbon extension of the acid group in its analog displaced the piperazine nitrogen only 1.3 Å further away from the carboxyl group. These results demonstrate the precision with which the hydrogen bond donor for water 2 must be located to stabilize the closed integrin state.
GR144053 ( Figure 2 ) was selected at Glaxo for potency and long duration of action after oral administration in the cynomolgus monkey ( Eldred et al., 1994 22. Eldred, C.D. ∙ Evans, B. ∙ Hindley, S. ... Orally active non-peptide fibrinogen receptor (GpIIb/IIIa) antagonists: identification of 4-[4-[4-(aminoiminomethyl)phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]-1-piperidineacetic acid as a long-acting, broad-spectrum antithrombotic agent J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37 :3882-3885 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Size-exclusion chromatography showed that GR144053 was indeed closing in Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ ( Figures 1 G–1I). Crystal structures of αIIbβ3 bound to GR144053 with Mn 2+ showed that the headpiece remained in state 1 ( Figures 1 I and 3 R). Strong 2F o -F c electron density showed the presence of waters 1 and 2 and the piperidine N1 of GR144053 in a strong hydrogen bond network ( Figures 4 F and S1 U). Thus, the chemical principles required for closing compounds survived key tests with chemical substitutions and enabled identification of further αIIbβ3 closing compounds.
SciFinder substructure searches for VLA-4 (α4β1) inhibitors found the Daiichi Sankyo (DS) compound 13g (DS 13g) ( Figure 2 ). We synthesized DS 13g and purchased commercially available DS 13d, which was described in the same publication ( Chiba et al., 2005 15. Chiba, J. ∙ Machinaga, N. ∙ Takashi, T. ... Identified a morpholinyl-4-piperidinylacetic acid derivative as a potent oral active VLA-4 antagonist Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15 :41-45 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is similar but contains a carbon atom in place of the nitrogen shown to be essential for stabilizing closure of αIIbβ3 ( Figure 2 ). We also tested the potent α4β1 antagonist Roche (Ro) 29 (compound 29 of Tilley et al., 2013 71. Tilley, J.W. ∙ Sidduri, A. ∙ Lou, J. ... Identification of N-acyl 4-(3-pyridonyl)phenylalanine derivatives and their orally active prodrug esters as dual acting α4β1 and α4β7 receptor antagonists Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2013; 23 :1036-1040 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in later experiments firategrast, which had partial agonist-like properties in phase II clinical trials ( Miller et al., 2012 48. Miller, D.H. ∙ Weber, T. ∙ Grove, R. ... Firategrast for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Lancet Neurol. 2012; 11 :131-139 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 ). Gel filtration in Mn 2+ showed that both DS 13d and Ro 29 induced opening of the α4β1 headpiece, whereas DS 13g did not ( Figure 5 A).
The effect of these α4β1 inhibitors on cell surface α4β1 conformation was examined using HUTS-21 mAb, which binds to the same epitope in the hybrid domain as HUTS-4 ( Luque et al., 1996 44. Luque, A. ∙ Gómez, M. ∙ Puzon, W. ... Activated conformations of very late activation integrins detected by a group of antibodies (HUTS) specific for a novel regulatory region (355–425) of the common β1 chain J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :11067-11075 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is specific for the open conformation ( Li et al., 2017 40. Li, J. ∙ Su, Y. ∙ Xia, W. ... Conformational equilibria and intrinsic affinities define integrin activation EMBO J. 2017; 36 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). DS 13d and Ro 29 strongly induced HUTS-21 epitope exposure on Jurkat T cells in Mg 2+ , whereas DS 13g did not ( Figure 5 B). Moreover, exposure of the HUTS-21 epitope by Mn 2+ was strongly inhibited by DS 13g, but not by DS 13d or Ro 29.
In the ensemble theory of conformational states ( Li et al., 2017 40. Li, J. ∙ Su, Y. ∙ Xia, W. ... Conformational equilibria and intrinsic affinities define integrin activation EMBO J. 2017; 36 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), compounds stabilize particular states by having higher affinity for them than alternative states. We therefore measured compound affinities for the closed and open conformations of α4β1 on Jurkat cells. Conformations were stabilized with conformation-specific Fab used at >100-fold their EC 50 values ( Li and Springer, 2018 39. Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Energy landscape differences among integrins establish the framework for understanding activation J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :397-412 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). The biological ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) bound with >1,900-fold higher affinity to the open than closed state, whereas firategrast, DS 13d, and the FITC-diphenylurea Leu-Asp-Val-Pro (LDVP) probe ( Li and Springer, 2018 39. Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Energy landscape differences among integrins establish the framework for understanding activation J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :397-412 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) bound 175-, and 52-, and 680-fold better to the open state, respectively ( Figures 5 C–5F). In contrast, DS 13g bound 2.8-fold better to the closed than the open state.
Conversely, we measured the ability of compounds to shift the basal α4β1 conformational ensemble on Jurkat cells toward the states that they stabilize using fluorescent, conformation-specific antibodies. These antibodies sensitively report the change in population of the closed, open, and extended conformations when used near their EC 50 values. ( Figures 5 G–5I). Firategrast and DS 13d increased the population of the EO state on Jurkat cells, whereas DS 13g decreased its population ( Figure 5 G). The compounds had cognate effects on the extended conformations (EC + EO), in agreement with the finding that the open state is always extended ( Figure 5 H). In contrast, firategrast and DS 13d decreased the population of the closed states (BC + EC), whereas DS 13g had no measurable effect ( Figure 5 I). The latter result is consistent with the finding that the BC+EC states are 98.9% basally populated on Jurkat cells ( Figure 4 D in Li and Springer, 2018 39. Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Energy landscape differences among integrins establish the framework for understanding activation J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :397-412 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). The greater decrease of closed states by firategrast than DS 13d ( Figure 5 I) is explicated by the greater selectivity of firategrast than DS 13d for the open state, 175- versus 52-fold, respectively ( Figure 5 F). In summary, a chemical principle for creating closing integrin inhibitors was transferrable from αIIbβ3 to a distant integrin relative and allowed us to identify a closing α4β1 integrin inhibitor, DS 13g, that was “hiding” in plain view in the chemical literature.
As antibodies are lacking to stabilize the closed and open conformations of β3 integrins, we measured affinity for wild-type (WT) αIIbβ3 on the surface of Expi293F transfectants, where it is predominantly in the BC state as shown by little LIBS exposure, or with an activating glycan wedge (β3 N305T) mutation ( Luo et al., 2003 42. Luo, B.H. ∙ Springer, T.A. ∙ Takagi, J. Stabilizing the open conformation of the integrin headpiece with a glycan wedge increases affinity for ligand Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :2403-2408 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ) that increases the proportion of the EO state. After measuring affinity of FITC-echistatin ( Figure 6 A), we measured its competition by αIIbβ3 inhibitors ( Figures 6 B, 6C, and S3 ) and determined inhibitor affinity ( Figure 6 D). The affinity of FITC-echistatin for αIIbβ3 was increased approximately 6-fold in the αIIbβ3 N305T ensemble. Similarly, all inhibitors characterized in other assays as opening showed higher affinity for the activated mutant than WT αIIbβ3 (lotrafibin, eptifibatide, tirofiban, roxifiban, gantofiban analog, EF-5154, sibrafiban, lamifiban, fradafiban, and BMS4-2). The concentration of cell surface αIIbβ3 in the assays, which was estimated by the ligand depletion effect, was higher than the K D values of the two highest affinity inhibitors, roxifiban and UR-2922 ( STAR Methods ), which made the error large for UR-2922. Other closing compounds showed higher affinities for the WT than the activated mutant αIIbβ3 (GR144053, gantofiban, BMS4, and BMS4-1).
To extend beyond industrial αIIbβ3 antagonists, we examined academic αIIbβ3 antagonists reported not to induce LIBS, RUC-4 ( Kereiakes et al., 2020 34. Kereiakes, D.J. ∙ Henry, T.D. ∙ DeMaria, A.N. ... First human use of RUC-4: A nonactivating second-generation small-molecule platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (integrin αiibβ3) inhibitor designed for subcutaneous point-of-care treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction J.

RUC-4: a novel αIIbβ3 antagonist for prehospital therapy of myocardial infarction Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2014; 34 :2321-2329 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2012 86. Zhu, J. ∙ Choi, W.-S. ∙ McCoy, J.G. ... Structure-guided design of a high affinity platelet integrin αIIbβ3 receptor antagonist that disrupts Mg2+ binding to the MIDAS Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar ) and M-tirofiban ( Adair et al., 2020 1. Adair, B.D. ∙ Alonso, J.L. ∙ van Agthoven, J. ... Structure-guided design of pure orthosteric inhibitors of αIIbβ3 that prevent thrombosis but preserve hemostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 ). We synthesized both M-tirofiban stereoisomers, and both were opening as shown by higher affinity for activated mutant than WT αIIbβ3 ensembles ( Figure 6 D). By contrast, RUC-4 had affinities for the WT and mutant ensembles that were indistinguishable.
Conformational preferences of the inhibitors were independently examined by induction of the LIBS epitope recognized by MBC319.4 antibody, specific for the extended states of β3 integrins ( Zhang et al., 2013 85. Zhang, C. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Jiang, X. ... Modulation of integrin activation and signaling by α1/α1'-helix unbending at the junction J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :5735-5747 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). On WT αIIbβ3 transfectants, lotrafiban and eptifibatide strongly induced LIBS exposure and tirofiban was the next strongest ( Figure 6 E). Weaker but significant induction was given by the fibrinogen γ C-terminal dodecapeptide, roxifiban, and EF-5154. High epitope exposure was related to a large increase in affinity for mutationally activated compared with WT αIIbβ3 ( Figure 6 E). With the αIIbβ3 N305T ensemble, all compounds that showed significant LIBS induction on the WT αIIbβ3 ensemble gave even higher induction ( Figure 6 F). Furthermore, all compounds that were characterized as opening in other assays, as well as M-tirofiban and M-tirofiban isomer, showed significant epitope induction. Conversely, all compounds characterized as closing in other assays, i.e., UR-2922, GR144053, gantofiban, BMS4, and BMS4-1, significantly suppressed LIBS induction. Closing compounds also suppressed LIBS epitope exposure induced by Mn 2+ and mutation of a GFFKR motif in the αIIb-β3 transmembrane domain interface ( Figure S4 ). RUC-4 had no effect on LIBS epitope expression and thus appears to be conformationally neutral.
We next tested compounds for effect on LIBS epitopes on washed platelets with or without activation by thrombin ( Figure 7 A). In the absence of thrombin, lamifiban, sibrafiban, and fradafiban modestly but significantly induced integrin extension. Stronger extension was induced by roxifiban, lotrafiban, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. M-tirofiban and RUC-4 had no significant effect, whereas M-tirofiban isomer showed modest but significant enhancement of epitope exposure. After activation with thrombin, epitope exposure was increased in the absence of compounds. All opening compounds including M-tirofiban and its isomer enhanced LIBS exposure, with all showing significant induction except for BMS4-2 (p = 0.06). LIBS exposure was decreased by all closing compounds (UR-2922, BMS4, BMS4-1, and GR144053) but did not reach significance. RUC-4 showed no effect on integrin extension.
Clot retraction, which follows conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin during clotting, is largely mediated by binding of platelet αIIbβ3 to fibrin ( Jansen and Hartmann, 2021 31. Jansen, E.E. ∙ Hartmann, M. Clot retraction: cellular mechanisms and inhibitors, measuring methods, and clinical implications Biomedicines. 2021; 9 :1064 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Representatives of all classes of αIIbβ3 inhibitors inhibited clot retraction ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S5 ). Both opening inhibitors (tirofiban, BMS4-2, sibrafiban, roxifiban, M-tirofiban, and M-tirofiban isomer) and closing inhibitors (BMS4-1 and UR-2922), as well as conformationally neutral RUC-4, were effective.
An important pharmacologic property of drugs is binding to proteins in the blood stream such as serum albumin. Therefore, we measured the effect of serum on K D values for a representative set of αIIbβ3 inhibitors ( Figures 7 D and S6 ). In 95% serum, M-tirofiban and its isomer showed greatly decreased affinities of 80- and 70-fold, respectively, compared with much smaller decreases by other drugs, such as 1.8-fold by tirofiban. Clot retraction assays are done in the presence of plasma. These results explain the previous failure to find inhibition of clot retraction by M-tirofiban ( Adair et al., 2020 1. Adair, B.D. ∙ Alonso, J.L. ∙ van Agthoven, J. ... Structure-guided design of pure orthosteric inhibitors of αIIbβ3 that prevent thrombosis but preserve hemostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed that M-tirofiban inhibited platelet aggregation in whole blood ( Figure 7 E).

Section: Discussion

The previous obscurity of closure-stabilizing integrin inhibitors and the lack of any previous information on their mechanism of action is emphasized by a docking study in a prominent review ( Cox et al., 2010 17. Cox, D. ∙ Brennan, M. ∙ Moran, N. Integrins as therapeutic targets: lessons and opportunities Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9 :804-820 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ) which suggested that the UR-2922 carboxyl group was not in the αIIbβ3 binding pocket and thus could not coordinate with the MIDAS metal ion and induce the active conformation of αIIbβ3. Instead, our crystal structure and structure-function studies led to an unexpected conclusion. We discovered a general chemical mechanism by which closing inhibitors can harness water to stabilize the resting, closed conformation of integrins. Closing compounds must have polar atoms in precisely the correct position to hydrogen bond directly, or indirectly through a water molecule, to a specific MIDAS water molecule that must be expelled in order for the integrin to convert from the closed to the open conformation. Closing inhibitors have no potential for agonism since their binding does not induce integrin conformational change toward the open state. Additionally, and in contrast to both conformationally neutral RUC-4 and opening inhibitors, they stabilize the closed conformation by suppressing conformational change toward the active integrin state.
The relationship between affinity of ligand for integrin conformational states and the ability of ligand binding to alter the populations of these states obeys the laws of classical thermodynamics as previously demonstrated for integrins α4β1 and α5β1 ( Li and Springer, 2018 39. Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Energy landscape differences among integrins establish the framework for understanding activation J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :397-412 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2017 40. Li, J. ∙ Su, Y. ∙ Xia, W. ... Conformational equilibria and intrinsic affinities define integrin activation EMBO J. 2017; 36 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the integrin field typically uses only antibodies specific for the extended or open states as reporters for integrin conformational change, we showed that, as predicted by ensemble theory, antibodies to the closed state can also be used as reporters. Several subtleties and implications of integrin ensembles and thermodynamics should be pointed out. Because the open conformation is not stable in the bent integrin conformation, drugs that stabilize opening and closing stabilize the extended and bent states, respectively, as shown explicitly here for integrin α4β1. Thus, the studies using Fabs to epitopes in extended αIIbβ3 in cellular assays in transfectants and platelets also reported the ability of compounds to stabilize the open or closed conformations. These Fab-based conformational measurements were in excellent agreement with explicit measurements of effects of compounds on opening of the headpiece by hydrodynamic radius in gel filtration and in crystal structures in Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ . RUC-2, a compound similar to RUC-4, was previously shown not to shift the elution of the αIIbβ3 headpiece in gel filtration or its structure in crystals, in agreement with its lack of effect on LIBS expression as confirmed here ( Zhu et al., 2012 86. Zhu, J. ∙ Choi, W.-S. ∙ McCoy, J.G. ... Structure-guided design of a high affinity platelet integrin αIIbβ3 receptor antagonist that disrupts Mg2+ binding to the MIDAS Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar ). As required by thermodynamics, the relative affinities of the compounds for WT and mutant, more open αIIbβ3 ensembles on transfectants also showed an excellent rank order correlation to ability to induce or suppress an extension-reporting epitope on transfectants and platelets. It appears to have been previously unappreciated in the integrin field that opening ligands can vary widely in their ability to induce LIBS, with closing ligands being an extreme example that suppress LIBS and perhaps warrant a change in nomenclature away from LIBS to name epitopes after the type of conformation they report. Equations and their graphical representation in Figure S7 provide guidance on use of reporter antibodies and explain why opening inhibitors with stronger conformational preferences are stronger LIBS inducers. The chemical features that define opening propensity, i.e., affinity for the open relative to the closed conformation, are complex; however, the peptidomimetics eptifibatide, lotrafiban, tirofiban, and roxifiban were among the most strongly opening compounds.
For comparison to small molecules, VCAM, a biological ligand for α4β1 was found to have >1,900-fold higher affinity for the open than the closed conformation. This large difference, and that of 6,000-fold for α5β1 binding to fibronectin ( Li et al., 2017 40. Li, J. ∙ Su, Y. ∙ Xia, W. ... Conformational equilibria and intrinsic affinities define integrin activation EMBO J. 2017; 36 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), contrast with the lower, but wide ranging, differences in affinity for open and closed states found among opening α4β1 inhibitors. Such comparisons will not be possible for αIIbβ3 inhibitors until methods are developed to obtain pure closed and open αIIbβ3 integrin states. However, the findings on α4β1 already raise the interesting possibility that the large affinity difference for biological ligands is an evolved trait that makes the integrin high and low-affinity states on and off-like.
Previously, lamifiban (Ro-44-9883) and sibrafiban (Ro 48-3657) were found not to induce LIBS epitopes on platelets in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) ( Baba et al., 2001 8. Baba, K. ∙ Aga, Y. ∙ Nakanishi, T. ... UR-3216: a manageable oral GPIIb/IIIa antagonist Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2001; 19 :25-40 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Murphy et al., 1998 55. Murphy, N.P. ∙ Pratico, D. ∙ Fitzgerald, D.J. Functional relevance of the expression of ligand-induced binding sites in the response to platelet GP IIb/IIIa antagonists in vivo J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286 :945-951 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could be consistent with differing assay sensitivities or a more activated αIIbβ3 ensemble on washed platelets than on platelets in PRP. Roche disclosed that it took lamifiban forward in clinical trials because of its potency and low induction of LIBS compared with other inhibitors ( Scarborough and Gretler, 2000 64. Scarborough, R.M. ∙ Gretler, D.D. Platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists as prototypical integrin blockers: novel parenteral and potential oral antithrombotic agents J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43 :3453-3473 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Two academically developed drugs were interesting comparators. M-tirofiban has a large hydrophobic substituent relative to tirofiban that was designed to block movement of the βI domain toward the open state and was reported to not induce opening and to block thrombosis without inhibiting hemostasis or clot retraction ( Adair et al., 2020 1. Adair, B.D. ∙ Alonso, J.L. ∙ van Agthoven, J. ... Structure-guided design of pure orthosteric inhibitors of αIIbβ3 that prevent thrombosis but preserve hemostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that M-tirofiban showed a lesser preference for activated mutant αIIbβ3 than tirofiban but remained an opening compound, albeit a weak one, and induced statistically significant LIBS exposure both on activated mutant αIIbβ3 transfectants and thrombin-stimulated platelets. The original report showed LIBS exposure by ADP-stimulated platelets that was increased with M-tirofiban but did not reach significance ( Adair et al., 2020 1. Adair, B.D. ∙ Alonso, J.L. ∙ van Agthoven, J. ... Structure-guided design of pure orthosteric inhibitors of αIIbβ3 that prevent thrombosis but preserve hemostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ); thrombin is a stronger platelet stimulator than ADP. The previous report tested only a single concentration of M-tirofiban, and a single, 10-fold lower concentration of tirofiban, for inhibition of clot retraction in 20% plasma ( Adair et al., 2020 1. Adair, B.D. ∙ Alonso, J.L. ∙ van Agthoven, J. ... Structure-guided design of pure orthosteric inhibitors of αIIbβ3 that prevent thrombosis but preserve hemostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we found that in 20% serum, the apparent affinity of M-tirofiban is 175-fold lower than tirofiban and that M-tirofiban completely inhibited clot retraction at the appropriate concentration. The lower potency of M-tirofiban may result from binding of its bulky aromatic modification relative to tirofiban ( Figure 2 ) to hydrophobic binding sites on serum albumin. Our results also call into question the finding that hemostasis was significantly inhibited by tirofiban and not M-tirofiban at 10-fold higher doses in mice with 40% human platelets, since M-tirofiban is 470-fold lower in affinity than tirofiban in 95% serum. All other tested αIIbβ3 inhibitors have been found to inhibit hemostasis as well as thrombosis ( Scarborough and Gretler, 2000 64. Scarborough, R.M. ∙ Gretler, D.D. Platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists as prototypical integrin blockers: novel parenteral and potential oral antithrombotic agents J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43 :3453-3473 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), and no significant difference in relative potency of inhibition of platelet aggregation versus bleeding time was found between the closing inhibitor UR-2922, sibrafiban (which resembles M-tirofiban in its opening propensity), and xemilofiban, which is a stronger LIBS inducer ( Baba et al., 2001 8. Baba, K. ∙ Aga, Y. ∙ Nakanishi, T. ... UR-3216: a manageable oral GPIIb/IIIa antagonist Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2001; 19 :25-40 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, we find that M-tirofiban is less efficacious in inhibiting platelet aggregation in whole blood (IC 50 of 3,140 ± 1,040 nM, 420-fold less potent than tirofiban) than originally reported (IC 50 of 18 ± 5 nM, 13-fold less potent than tirofiban).
RUC-4 is an academically developed αIIbβ3 inhibitor in clinical trials for first point-of-care treatment of myocardial infarction ( Kereiakes et al., 2020 34. Kereiakes, D.J. ∙ Henry, T.D. ∙ DeMaria, A.N. ... First human use of RUC-4: A nonactivating second-generation small-molecule platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (integrin αiibβ3) inhibitor designed for subcutaneous point-of-care treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction J. Am. Heart Assoc. 2020; 9 :e016552 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2014 41. Li, J. ∙ Vootukuri, S. ∙ Shang, Y. ... RUC-4: a novel αIIbβ3 antagonist for prehospital therapy of myocardial infarction Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2014; 34 :2321-2329 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like the earlier described compound pentamidine ( Cox et al., 1996 16. Cox, D. ∙ Aoki, T. ∙ Seki, J. ... Pentamidine is a specific, non-peptide, GPIIb/IIIa antagonist Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75 :503-509 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), RUC compounds are specific αIIbβ3 inhibitors that lack a carboxyl group and do not induce LIBS epitopes or integrin headpiece opening ( Zhu et al., 2012 86. Zhu, J. ∙ Choi, W.-S. ∙ McCoy, J.G. ... Structure-guided design of a high affinity platelet integrin αIIbβ3 receptor antagonist that disrupts Mg2+ binding to the MIDAS Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar ). RUC-4 occupied a unique intermediate position in our study between opening and closing compounds as a conformationally neutral compound. It had equal affinity for WT and mutant activated αIIbβ3 transfectants and neither enhanced nor suppressed LIBS epitope exposure.
An aspirational goal in the integrin field has been to create small-molecule integrin inhibitors that do not induce integrin conformational change or activation. We now have taken this concept one step further, by discovering that closing compounds can suppress integrin opening by shifting the conformational ensemble toward the low-affinity closed states. This feature may offer additional clinical benefit. For example, platelets of patients with acute coronary syndrome are significantly more activated than healthy controls even after clinical stabilization ( Ault et al., 1999 7. Ault, K.A. ∙ Cannon, C.P. ∙ Mitchell, J. ... Platelet activation in patients after an acute coronary syndrome: results from the TIMI-12 trial. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1999; 33 :634-639 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ; Davì and Patrono, 2007 19. Davì, G. ∙ Patrono, C. Platelet activation and atherothrombosis N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 :2482-2494 Crossref Scopus (1827) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fitzgerald et al., 1986 25. Fitzgerald, D.J. ∙ Roy, L. ∙ Catella, F. ... Platelet activation in unstable coronary disease N.

Platelet hyperreactivity and prognosis in survivors of myocardial infarction N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322 :1549-1554 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, treatment of such patients with the αIIbβ3 inhibitor orbofiban increased αIIbβ3 conformational change, antibody-stimulated thromboxane B2 production, and CD63 expression ( Cox et al., 2000 18. Cox, D. ∙ Smith, R. ∙ Quinn, M. ... Evidence of platelet activation during treatment with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2000; 36 :1514-1519 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many αIIbβ3 closing compounds with excellent drug-like properties are currently available. These include gantofiban, which entered phase II clinical trials, and UR-2922. Moreover, GR144053 is commercially available and has been used without knowledge of its closing property in animals with tissue plasminogen activator or losartan after thrombotic injury to suppress neointima formation ( Matsuno et al., 1997 47. Matsuno, H. ∙ Kozawa, O. ∙ Niwa, M. ... GR144053, a fibrinogen receptor antagonist, enhances the suppression of neointima formation by losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, in the injured carotid artery of hamster Br. J.

Effect of GR144053, a fibrinogen-receptor antagonist, on thrombus formation and vascular patency after thrombolysis by tPA in the injured carotid artery of the hamster J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 32 :191-197 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our results demonstrated that the phase II trial of firategrast in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis was conducted with an opening inhibitor ( Miller et al., 2012 48. Miller, D.H. ∙ Weber, T. ∙ Grove, R. ... Firategrast for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Lancet Neurol. 2012; 11 :131-139 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). The significant increase in gadolinium-enhanced lesions at the lowest dose, lack of effect at the middle dose, and significant decrease at the highest dose are consistent with partial agonism. Drug blood concentrations were measured but not reported. This is unfortunate because we could have used the data reported here on firategrast binding affinity to cells and opening propensity to estimate at each drug concentration the percentage of drug-bound α4β1 and the percentage of α4β1 that transitioned from BC to extended and open conformations.
It is common for companies and academic investigators alike to measure the potency of integrin inhibitors and biological ligands in Mn 2+ . Mn 2+ increases affinity by two mechanisms: replacing Mg 2+ at the MIDAS increases integrin affinity independently of conformation, and replacing Ca 2+ at the adjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) stabilizes the open conformation ( Anderson et al., 2022 5. Anderson, J.M. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Regulation of integrin α5β1 conformational states and intrinsic affinities by metal ions and the ADMIDAS Mol. Biol. Cell. 2022; 33 :ar56 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). The latter mechanism artefactually inflates the affinity of opening compared with closing inhibitors. Thus, we caution against using Mn 2+ to measure drug potency, which might have been one factor that influenced Daiiichi Sanko to put an α4β1 inhibitor into patients that based on its structure is opening ( Muro et al., 2009 54. Muro, F. ∙ Iimura, S. ∙ Sugimoto, Y. ... Discovery of trans-4-[1-[[2, 5-Dichloro-4-(1-methyl-3-indolylcarboxamido)phenyl]acetyl]-(4S)-methoxy-(2S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy]cyclohexanecarboxylic acid: an orally active, selective very late antigen-4 antagonist J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52 :7974-7992 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Many other closing compound scaffolds can be created based on the essential chemical features that we have established here. Compounds must have carboxyl groups and nearby polar atoms in positions to either accept a hydrogen bond from water 1 or donate a hydrogen bond to water 2. Water 1 in the UR-2922 structure is polarized because one of its hydrogens must orient toward the N atom in UR-2922 and one of its lone electron pairs must orient toward the MIDAS metal ion. Notably, hydrogen bond donation by the protonated piperazine or piperidine nitrogen in the other compound class to relay water 2 may result in the same proposed polarity of water 1 as deduced from first chemical principles from the UR-2922 structure. The importance of donating rather than accepting a hydrogen bond to water 2 is emphasized by comparison to sibrafiban and lamifiban. These opening inhibitors have an oxygen two atoms away from the carboxyl group, in the same position as the nitrogen in closing compounds such as BMS4 ( Figure 2 ); however, such an ether oxygen cannot donate a hydrogen bond. Not only are sibrafiban and lamifiban not closing but they also do not have a bound water 2, suggesting that proper hydrogen bond polarity is important for forming a water network around the MIDAS metal ion. In contrast to the ether oxygen, it might be possible to create a closing compound with a suitably positioned hydroxyl oxygen. Although the hydrogen bond donor for water 2 is in piperidine or piperazine rings in the structures identified here, linear structures or rings of other size also should be possible.
The integrin family may be divided into five subfamilies with distinct ligand specificities. Despite their distant relationship in different subfamilies, we were able to extend the discovery of closing compounds from integrin αIIbβ3 to integrin α4β1. Unlike αIIbβ3, α4β1 inhibitors to the best of our knowledge had not been examined for their ability to induce LIBS epitopes. Our ability to use the chemical principles we had discovered with αIIbβ3 to discover a closing inhibitor of α4β1 validates the generality of these principles. The DSXSX MIDAS motif is invariant in integrin β subunits. Furthermore, the movement of Ser 2 in this motif into the position of water 1 has been seen in all structurally characterized integrins, including the β3 integrins αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 ( Xiao et al., 2004 80.

Structural specializations of α4β7 an integrin that mediates rolling adhesion J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196 :131-146 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), and even in the atypical β8 integrin αVβ8 ( Campbell et al., 2020 13. Campbell, M.G. ∙ Cormier, A. ∙ Ito, S. ...

Wang, J. ∙ Su, Y. ∙ Iacob, R.E. ... General structural features that regulate integrin affinity revealed by atypical αVβ8 Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5481 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the general design principles reported here for building closure-stabilizing integrin inhibitors can serve to guide designs of antagonists for other integrins, many of which are currently being pursued in biopharma in challenging diseases including ulcerative colitis, fibrosis, and cancer. Closing integrin inhibitors should not have paradoxical activating effects since they not only potently block ligand binding but also stabilize the resting integrin conformation against activating stress. This property is distinct from their ability to inhibit ligand binding, which for both closing and opening inhibitors is controlled by their concentrations relative to their IC 90 values. The efficacy of closing inhibitors will need to be further tested in animal studies, as well as in clinical trials.
The molecular mechanisms by which opening integrin inhibitors cause partial agonism remain to be fully defined. Many other factors besides partial agonism may have contributed to clinical failure of parenteral and oral integrin antagonists ( Aga et al., 2004 3. Aga, Y. ∙ Baba, K. ∙ Tam, S. ... UR-3216: a new generation oral platelet GPIIb/IIIa antagonist Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10 :1597-1601 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). For αIIbβ3, these included the development of antibodies specific for the drug-integrin complex and the difficulty of achieving the desired percentage inhibition of αIIbβ3 in the face of short drug half-lives and causing bleeding at high αIIbβ3 inhibition. Such factors could also lead to the failure of closing antagonists. The ratios of affinities of inhibitors for WT and glycan wedge αIIbβ3 transfectants are for multi-state ensembles and underestimate the difference in affinity between the open and closed states of αIIbβ3. Intact integrins on the cell surface and ectodomain and headpiece fragments differ in free energy difference between open and closed conformations and therefore differ in sensitivity to the effects of opening and closing inhibitors on their conformations. Although we have established principles for creating closure-stabilizing inhibitors that should be applicable to all integrins, successful oral drugs require many other attributes. These include specificity, adsorption, resistance to metabolism and excretion, and long half-life. The breadth of chemical scaffolds that can hydrogen bond to stabilize water 1 directly or through water 2 is likely to be large and not to require that the hydrogen bonding moiety be in a ring but remains to be explored, and thus, the full scope for adding further desirable chemical features to closing compounds remains unknown.

Expression and purification of αIIbβ3 headpiece was as described ( Xiao et al., 2004 80. Xiao, T. ∙ Takagi, J. ∙ Coller, B.S. ... Structural basis for allostery in integrins and binding of fibrinogen-mimetic therapeutics Nature. 2004; 432 :59-67 Crossref Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2010 88.

Closed headpiece of integrin αIIbβ3 and its complex with an αIIbβ3-specific antagonist that does not induce opening Blood. 2010; 116 :5050-5059 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). The α4 construct contains the β-propeller and thigh domains, from residue Y1 to R587, with a R558A mutation to eliminate a furin cleavage site in the thigh domain ( Yu et al., 2012 83. Yu, Y. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Mi, L.Z. ... Structural specializations of α4β7 an integrin that mediates rolling adhesion J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196 :131-146 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). The α4 headpiece cDNA fused with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site, an ACID coiled-coil, and a StrepII tag was inserted into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector. The β1 construct contains PSI, hybrid, βI, and EGF1 domains, from Q1 to E481. The β1 headpiece cDNA fused with a TEV site, a BASE coiled-coil, and a His6 Tag was inserted into the pEF1/Puro vector. The α4β1 headpiece construct was stably expressed in CHO lec 3.2.1.8 cells. Culture supernatant was concentrated and buffer exchanged to TBS buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) using a tangential flow concentrator. The α4β1 headpiece was purified using a Ni-NTA column followed by a Strep-Tactin column. The coiled-coils and tags were then removed by TEV digestion as described ( Yu et al., 2013 82. Yu, Y. ∙ Schürpf, T. ∙ Springer, T.A. How natalizumab binds and antagonizes α4 integrins J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :32314-32325 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ), but without the presence of Fab. Finally, the α4β1 headpiece was subjected to Superdex 200 chromatography in TBS buffer with 1 mM Mg 2+ and 1 mM Ca 2+ .
For size-exclusion chromatography of αIIbβ3 headpiece, a Superdex 200 column was equilibrated with 10 μM of inhibitor in HEPES buffered saline (HBS) plus either 1 mM Mg 2+ , 1 mM Ca 2+ or 2 mM Mn 2+ , 0.2mM Ca 2+ . The αIIbβ3 headpiece samples (30 μg) were pre-incubated with 60 μM of drug in corresponding buffers for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to chromatography. R h values were calculated from peak elution volumes using ovalbumin, BSA, catalase, and aldolase as standards of known R h ( Zhu et al., 2010 88. Zhu, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Negri, A. ... Closed headpiece of integrin αIIbβ3 and its complex with an αIIbβ3-specific antagonist that does not induce opening Blood. 2010; 116 :5050-5059 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conditions were identical for α4β1 headpiece, except a Zenix-C SEC300 size-exclusion column (Sepax Technologies, Newark, DE) was used, 10 μg of α4β1 headpiece was used, and data was from 3 or more runs.
Expression and crystallization of αIIbβ3 headpiece-10E5 Fab complex in the closed conformation was as reported ( Zhu et al., 2010 88. Zhu, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Negri, A. ... Closed headpiece of integrin αIIbβ3 and its complex with an αIIbβ3-specific antagonist that does not induce opening Blood. 2010; 116 :5050-5059 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to compound soaking, headpiece crystals were stabilized at a higher PEG concentration (15% PEG 8000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.9), and glycerol was added in 5% increments to 15%. Compound was added (0.1-1 mM; see Table S1 ) together with 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 or 2 mM MnCl 2 and 0.2 mM CaCl 2 , in the final cryo increment to 20% glycerol. After 4 h crystals were plunge frozen in liquid N 2 . Diffraction data was collected in GM/CA-CAT at APS. Refinements were with Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ligand geometry and protonation states were calculated using Prime (with OPLS2005 force field) and Epik packages from Schrödinger (New York, NY). Geometry-optimized (with hydrogens) ligand coordinates were input to eLBOW ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate restraint files for Phenix refinement. Ligands were manually fit to initial F o -F c difference maps using Coot and complexes were further refined.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109 :863-875 Crossref Scopus (588) PubMed Google Scholar ). IgG produced from hybridoma was purified by protein G. For Fab fragments, antibodies were digested with papain (500:1 IgG:papain) in PBS with 10 mM EDTA and 10 mM L-Cys at 37°C for 18 h. After buffer exchange with 50 mM Tris (pH 9), the Fab was purified by anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q HP, GE Healthcare), after which the fractions containing Fab were concentrated, flash frozen, and stored at -80°C for future use. Antibodies and Fabs were fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 NHS Ester or Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Ester (ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBS.
Jurkat cells (10 6 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 medium and 10% FBS) were washed twice with assay medium (Leibovitz’s L-15 medium and 1% BSA) containing 5 mM EDTA, twice with assay medium alone, and resuspended in assay medium. For competitive binding experiments, each 50-μl sample contained 10 6 cells/ml, the indicated concentration of FITC-LDVP (Tocris Bioscience), the indicated Fabs, and varying concentrations of α4β1 inhibitors or VCAM D1D2 ( Li and Springer, 2018 39.

For LIBS antibody epitope exposure assays, each 50-μl sample contained 10 6 cells/ml, the indicated concentration of fluorescently labeled antibody or Fab, and indicated concentrations of α4β1 inhibitors. Mixtures were allowed to equilibrate at 22°C for 2 h before flow cytometry (BD FAC SCanto II) without washing ( Li and Springer, 2018 39. Li, J. ∙ Springer, T.A.

Binding of FITC-LDVP or fluorescently labeled LIBS antibodies were measured as mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI obs ) at each indicated inhibitor concentration ( C inhibitor ). Competitive binding curves and LIBS antibody exposure curves were both fitted with a 3-parameter dose response curve ( Equation 1 ) with MFI in absence of inhibitor ( MFI 0 ), MFI at saturating concentration of inhibitor ( MFI sat ), and half maximal effective concentration of the inhibitor (EC 50 ), as fitting parameters. Affinity of inhibitors ( 𝐾 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑑 ) was derived ( Equation 2 ) from the fitted EC 50 value in competitive binding curve, the concentration of FITC-LDVP probe ( C LDVP ), and the binding affinity of the FITC-LDVP probe ( 𝐾 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 𝑉 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑑 ).

αV and α5 subunits were sequentially knocked out from Expi293F cells using CRISPR double nicking ( Ran et al., 2013 62. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ). To make the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expressing plasmids, double stranded DNA oligos, 5’-CACCG GCCCTTCAAGGATTTGAGAT GTTT-3’ (αV_guide A), 5’-CACCG CGAAGCATGCCACCAAGCTT GTTT-3’ (αV_guide B), 5’-CACCG GTACAGTGGAGCGCATGCCT GTTT-3’ (α5_guide A), and 5’-CACCG GTACAGTGGAGCGCATGCCT GTTT-3’ (α5_guide B), were cloned into the BbSI site of the pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-puro vector (Addgene: 48141). To create the Expi293F αV knock-out, the pair of sgRNA expressing plasmids targeting αV were transfected into Expi293F cells and knock-out cells were selected by two rounds of panning ( Wysocki and Sato, 1978 78. Wysocki, L.J. ∙ Sato, V.L. "Panning" for lymphocytes: A method for cell selection Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75 :2844-2848 Crossref Scopus (1253) PubMed Google Scholar ) and one round of FACS sorting, both with αV-specific antibody 17E6 ( Mitjans et al., 1995 49. Mitjans, F. ∙ Sander, D. ∙ Adán, J. ... An anti-α v-integrin antibody that blocks integrin function inhibits the development of a human melanoma in nude mice J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108 :2825-2838 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To create the Expi293F αV & α5 double knock-out, the pair of sgRNA expressing plasmids targeting α5 were transfected into Expi293F αV knock-out cells and the double knock-out cells were selected by two rounds of panning and one round of FACS sorting, both with α5 specific antibody mAb16 ( Akiyama et al., 1989 4. Akiyama, S.K. ∙ Yamada, S.S. ∙ Chen, W.T. ... Analysis of fibronectin receptor function with monoclonal antibodies: roles in cell adhesion, migration, matrix assembly, and cytoskeletal organization J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109 :863-875 Crossref Scopus (588) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Measurements were done on Expi293F cells with the integrin α5 and αV subunits knocked out (Expi293F α5&αV KO) transiently transfected with αIIb and β3 expression plasmids, or with αIIb and β3_N305T expression plasmids. For transfection, 0.5ug plasmid coding αIIb subunit in PD2529 vector (Atum) and 0.5ug plasmid coding β3 or β3_N305T in PD2529 vector were incubated with 1 μL FectoPro (Polyplus) in 100 uL Opti-MEM (Gibco) for 10 min at room temperature were added per ml of Expi293F α5&αV KO cells (3 ∗ 10 6 /mL) in Expi293 expression medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 24 hrs after transfection, valproic acid and glucose were added to the culture to final concentrations of 3 mM and 0.4%, respectively. 48 hours post transfection, cells were washed twice with assay medium (Leibovitz’s L-15 medium and 0.1% BSA) containing 5 mM EDTA, twice with assay medium alone, and resuspended in assay medium or L15 supplemented with the indicated concentration of serum and 50 mM HEPES, pH7.4. For measuring the affinity of FITC-echistatin probe (United States Biological) to αIIbβ3 WT or αIIbβ3_N305T mutant, each 50-μl sample contained 10 6 cells/ml, 5 nM Alexa647 labeled MBC319.4 Fab (AF647-MBC319.4), and varying concentrations of FITC-echistatin. For competitive binding experiments, each 50-μl sample contained 10 6 cells/ml, indicated concentrations of FITC-echistatin, and varying concentrations of αIIbβ3 inhibitors. For LIBS antibody epitope exposure assays, each 50-μl sample contained 10 6 cells/ml, 20 nM Alexa647 labeled MBC319.4 Fab, and αIIbβ3 inhibitors at concentrations equaling100x their K d values for αIIbβ3 wild type reported in Figure 6 D. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate at 22°C for 2 h before flow cytometry (BD FAC SCanto II) without washing.
FITC-echistatin concentration ( C echistatin ) dependent binding of 5nM AF647-MBC319.4 Fab ( MFI obs ) was fitted to Equation 3 with binding affinity of FITC-echistatin ( 𝐾 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑑 ), MFI in absence of FITC-echistatin ( MFI 0 ), and MFI at saturating concentration of FITC-echistatin ( MFI sat ) as fitting parameters. 𝑀 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐼 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑠 = 𝑀 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐼 0 − 𝑀 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐼 0 − 𝑀 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐼 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 1 + 𝐾 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑑 / 𝐶 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 (Equation 3)
The competitive binding curves of the high affinity αIIbβ3 inhibitors (UR-2922 and roxifban), cannot be reliably fitted with the 3-parameter dose response curve ( Equation 1 ) because their K d values are smaller than the concentration range of integrins in the cell suspension. Under these conditions, binding to cells can significantly deplete the competitor from solution when used at low concentration, and the total concentration of competitor could not be used as an approximation of its free concentration. To solve this problem, we fit the competitive binding curves considering the competitor depletion effect. In detail, αIIbβ3 inhibitor concentration ( C inhibitor ) dependent binding of FITC-echistatin ( MFI obs ), for two inhibitors with high binding affinity, UR-2922 and roxifiban, was fitted with affinity of inhibitor ( 𝐾 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑑 ), MFI in absence of inhibitor ( MFI 0 ), MFI at saturating concentration of inhibitor ( MFI sat ) and the integrin concentration ( C integrin ) expressed on transfectants as fitting parameters, with previously determined FITC-echistatin affinity ( 𝐾 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑑 ), inhibitor concentration ( 𝐶 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ) and FITC-echistatin concentration ( 𝐶 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ) as known parameters ( Equation 4 ). Equation 4 was derived based on the definition of affinity and law of mass conservation detailed in Equations 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 . Function F in Equation 4 and its derivation are described in the Mathematica file Equation 4 .nb.

The competitive binding curves of other αIIbβ3 inhibitors were fitted to Equation 4 in the same way, except that the C integrin determined using UR-2922 and roxifiban was used as a known parameter.
Jurkat cells were incubated with 10 μM compound, together with 10 μg/ml of HUTS-21 IgG or control mAb (mouse IgG) at 4°C in buffer that contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl and 1% BSA, plus 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 or 1 mM MnCl 2 .

The study with human blood samples was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Medical College of Wisconsin. Blood samples anticoagulated with acid-citrate-dextrose were collected from healthy donors who had not taken any medication known to inhibit platelet function for at least a week. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by spinning the blood samples at 140×g for 12 min at RT. After adding prostaglandin E1 (Sigma, #P5515) to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml, the PRP was centrifuged at 1900×g for 10 min at RT. The platelet pellet was washed in Ringer's citrate-dextrose buffer (108 mM NaCl, 3.8 mM KCl, 1.7 mM NaHCO3, 21.2 mM sodium citrate, 27.8 mM glucose, 1.1 mM MgCl2, pH 6.5) and resuspended in Tyrode’s buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 11.9 mM NaHCO3, 0.43 mM NaHPO4, 5.5 mM glucose, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1% BSA, 1mM CaCl 2 , and 1 mM MgCl 2 . 36 μl of washed platelets at 0.2×10 8 /ml were mixed with 4 μl of buffer control or αIIbβ3 inhibitors and incubated for 20 min at RT. Subsequently, 5 μl of thrombin at 5 U/ml and 5 μl of Alexa647-conjugated MBC319.4 Fab at 250 nM were added to 40 μl of treated platelets for 30 min at RT. Final inhibitor concentrations were >70x K D measured in 0.1% BSA with WT αIIbβ3 transfectants. Platelet fluorescence without washing was measured by flow cytometry using LSRII (BD Biosciences). The assay was done on three different days with blood samples from two different donors.
261 μl of citrated-PRP was mixed with 29 μl of buffer control or αIIbβ3 inhibitors at different concentrations prepared in Tyrode’s buffer supplemented with 1% BSA for 20 min at RT. Clot retraction was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of 7.5 U/ml thrombin prepared in Tyrode’s buffer supplemented with 1% BSA to a glass tube containing 270 μl inhibitor-treated PRP. The clots were allowed to retract at 37 ° C. Images were taken at 15-min intervals. The whole reaction and clot areas were calculated with ImageJ software. The clot retraction was presented as 1–(clot area/whole reaction area). The IC 50 for 30 and 90 mins of clot retraction was calculated by fitting the data with the function of inhibitor vs response (three parameters) in Prism 8. The assay was done three times with PRP from three donors.
Whole blood platelet aggregation was measured by impedance aggregometry using a Chrono-log Model 700 aggregometer. Sodium citrate anticoagulated blood was left at RT for 30min before testing and used within 3h. 0.5 ml of whole blood was incubated with 0.5 ml physiologic saline supplemented with different concentrations of αIIbβ3 inhibitors (stock solutions prepared in saline) for 5 min at 37 ° C without stirring. Aggregation was induced by adding 10 μl ADP (final concentration: 20μM). Platelet aggregation was recorded for 6 min with stirring at 1200rpm at 37 ° C. Data were presented as the relative aggregation by calculating the background-subtracted impedance (Ohms) as a percentage of impedance in absence of inhibitors. IC 50 was calculated by fitting the data with the function of inhibitor vs response (three parameters) in Prism 8. The assay was done three times with whole blood from three different donors.

Synthesis of M-tirofiban was delayed by lack of publication of its synthetic route ( Adair et al., 2020 1. Adair, B.D. ∙ Alonso, J.L. ∙ van Agthoven, J. ... Structure-guided design of pure orthosteric inhibitors of αIIbβ3 that prevent thrombosis but preserve hemostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our first attempt of stereo-specific synthesis resulted in a major product with a small amount of side product. A second synthesis resulted in M-tirofiban and its stereo-isomer, M-tirofiban isomer. Neither the side-product nor the stereoisomers would be distinguished by the reported mass spectrometry results ( Adair et al., 2020 1. Adair, B.D. ∙ Alonso, J.L. ∙ van Agthoven, J. ... Structure-guided design of pure orthosteric inhibitors of αIIbβ3 that prevent thrombosis but preserve hemostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Figure viewer In failed first synthesis of M-tirofiban and M-tirofiban isomer, the title compound was obtained after prep-HPLC separation. However, there were two sets of 1 H NMR peaks. We analyzed the HNMR and the synthetic route carefully again. The suspected impurity was the M-tirofiban-byproduct which would be difficult to remove by prep-HPLC due to the very close polarity.
The impurity should have been formed during synthesis of compound 3 due to the excess NaH. Thus, a new batch was synthesized using synthetic synthetic scheme 1 (top) of M-tirofiban and M-tirofiban isomer.

Compound 1 (700 mg, 2.72 mmol, 1.00 eq ) was added to a round bottom flask charged with ACN (3.0 mL), then PPh 3 (1.07 g, 4.08 mmol, 1.50 eq ) and CBr 4 (1.35 g, 4.08 mmol, 1.50 eq ) were added at 0°C.

To a solution of compound 3 (350 mg, 563 μmol, 1.00 eq ) in EtOAc (2.0 mL) was added dropwise HCl/EtOAc (4 M, 1.41 mL, 10.0 eq ) at 0°C. The resulting mixture was stirred at 20°C for 4 hrs. LCMS showed no compound 3 remained, and one major new peak (Rt = 2.047, m/z = 466) with desired mass was detected. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a residue. The residue was purified by prep-HPLC (HCl condition). Column: Phenomenex Luna C18 200×40mm×10um; mobile phase: [water (0.04%HCl)-ACN]; B%: 10%-50% ACN, 8 min). The fractions after prep-HPLC were lyophilized directly to give Compound 4 (150 mg, 322 μmol, 57.2% yield) as a white solid. 1 H NMR (400 MHz DMSO) δ 13.01 (br s, 1H), 9.34 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 8.92 (br s, 1H), 8.66 (br s, 1H), 7.83 - 7.90 (m, 2H), 7.53 – 7.56 (m, 2H), 7.16 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 1H), 6.77 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 4.58 - 4.64 (m, 1H), 3.85 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 2H), 3.07 - 3.17 (m, 4H), 2.73 - 2.76 (m, 2H), 1.70 - 1.73 (m, 4H), 1.30 - 1.34 (m, 1H), 1.19 - 1.25 (m, 6H).
After this step, two peaks of target compound were detected by chiral HPLC. Racemization would have occurred in the alkylation reaction of step 2. The HCl salt of the final product could not be separated by chiral chromatography i.e., supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Therefore, Boc was re-added to the amine and then the isomers were separated by SFC. Finally, M-tirofiban and M-tirofiban isomer were obtained after Boc removal.

Jieqing Zhu found that UR-2922 was a closing compound in gel filtration and grew crystals with UR-2922, tirofiban, eptifibatide, and EF-5154 in Mg 2+ with which Jianghai Zhu collected data and refined structures. Jieqing Zhu later as an independent investigator supervised T.T.H.N., and they collected and analyzed data on LIBS epitope induction on platelets and inhibition of clot retraction and platelet aggregation by compounds and wrote methods and figure legends. F.-Y.L. found BMS4 in the literature and later gantofiban, GR144508, DS 13d, DS 13g, and BMS4-2, as well as other control compounds. Y.Z. supervised Y.X. in synthesizing these and related compounds including clinically tested αIIbβ3 inhibitors. F.-Y.L. determined which of these compounds were closing and opening by gel filtration and LIBS exposure and crystallized, collected data, and refined the other 17 αIIbβ3—compound complex structures in Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ . F.-Y.L. first observed that closing compounds uniquely hydrogen bonded to water 1 or 2 to stabilize the closed conformation. Together, Jianghai Zhu and F.-Y.L. deposited 21 crystal structures. F.-Y.L. extended closing compounds to integrin α4β1. J.L. quantitatively measured affinities of α4β1 inhibitors for the EO state, BC+EC ensemble, and basal ensemble and measured their ability to induce LIBS epitopes for the extended, closed, and open conformations. J.L. also measured affinities of αIIbβ3 inhibitors for WT and mutant activated αIIbβ3, assessed the induction of LIBS epitopes, and the effect of serum on affinity, and wrote equations and analyzed data.
