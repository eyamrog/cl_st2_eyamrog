Title: Glia-to-Neuron Conversion by CRISPR-CasRx Alleviates Symptoms of Neurological Disease in Mice


Abstract: Summary

Conversion of glial cells into functional neurons represents a potential therapeutic approach for replenishing neuronal loss associated with neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury. Previous attempts in this area using expression of transcription factors were hindered by the low conversion efficiency and failure of generating desired neuronal types in vivo . Here, we report that downregulation of a single RNA-binding protein, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 ( Ptbp1 ), using in vivo viral delivery of a recently developed RNA-targeting CRISPR system CasRx, resulted in the conversion of Müller glia into retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with a high efficiency, leading to the alleviation of disease symptoms associated with RGC loss. Furthermore, this approach also induced neurons with dopaminergic features in the striatum and alleviated motor defects in a Parkinson’s disease mouse model. Thus, glia-to-neuron conversion by CasRx-mediated Ptbp1 knockdown represents a promising in vivo genetic approach for treating a variety of disorders due to neuronal loss.

Section: Introduction

Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating diseases associated with the progressive loss of neurons in various parts of the nervous system. For example, degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the sole output neurons of the retina, represents the leading cause of retinal diseases with permanent blindness ( Quigley and Broman, 2006 43. Quigley, H.A. ∙ Broman, A.T. The number of people with glaucoma worldwide in 2010 and 2020 Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2006; 90 :262-267 Crossref Scopus (5873) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trans -differentiation of Müller glia (MG) into RGCs has been proposed to be a potential therapy for restoring visual function. However, MG lose the neurogenic capacity at ~2 postnatal weeks in mice and MG-to-RGC conversion has not been achieved in mature mammalian retinas so far ( Elsaeidi et al., 2018; Laha et al., 2017; Roska and Sahel, 2018; Ueki et al., 2015 14.

Recent in vitro studies showed that downregulating the expression of a single gene, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 ( Ptbp1 ), which encodes a RNA binding protein, was sufficient to convert cultured mouse fibroblasts and N2a cells into functional neurons ( Xue et al., 2013 59.

However, in vivo neuronal conversion by downregulating Ptbp1 has not been explored. A recently characterized RNA-guided and RNA-targeting CRISPR protein family known as Cas13 offers an efficient approach for manipulation of RNA transcripts ( Abudayyeh et al., 2016; Cox et al., 2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016; Gootenberg et al., 2017; Knott and Doudna, 2018; Konermann et al., 2018 1.

Among Cas13 proteins, an ortholog of CRISPR-Cas13d (CasRx) has the smallest size and exhibits high targeting specificity and efficiency, making it ideal for in vivo therapeutic application ( Konermann et al., 2018 31.

In the present study, we showed that MG could be converted into RGCs by injecting AAVs expressing CasRx and two guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting Ptbp1 mRNA in both intact and damaged mature retinas. Notably, converted RGCs established central projections to dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and superior colliculus (SC) and partially restored visual functions in a mouse model with drug-induced retinal injury. Using a similar approach, we demonstrated that knockdown of Ptbp1 in the striatum locally induced neurons expressing dopaminergic markers with a high efficiency and alleviated motor dysfunctions caused by midbrain dopamine neuronal loss in a mouse model of PD. Thus, CasRx-mediated Ptbp1 knockdown could achieve efficient glia-to-neuron conversion that replenishes the desired neuronal types, paving the way for future therapeutic applications.

Section: Results

To examine the efficiency of CasRx-mediated knockdown of Ptbp1 , we first screen six gRNAs for their efficiency in CasRx editing of Ptbp1 in both N2a cells and cultured astrocytes ( Figures 1 A and 1B). We found that co-transfection of a vector containing CasRx gene with two gRNAs 5 and 6 that target Ptbp1 exon IV and VII, resulted in 87% ± 0.4% and 76% ± 4% (SEM, n = 5 repeats) reduction of Ptbp1 mRNA in N2a cells and cultured astrocytes, respectively ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Transcriptome analysis showed that Ptbp1 was specifically downregulated while the transcriptional level of typical neuronal genes remained unchanged, 2 days after transfection ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 A).
Given the finding that Ptbp1 knockdown could convert cultured mouse fibroblasts and N2a cells into functional neurons ( Xue et al., 2013 59. Xue, Y. ∙ Ouyang, K. ∙ Huang, J. ... Direct conversion of fibroblasts to neurons by reprogramming PTB-regulated microRNA circuits Cell. 2013; 152 :82-96 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next examined whether Ptbp1 knockdown in the mature retina could result in conversion of MG into RGCs in vivo . The possibility of using CasRx-induced knockdown of Ptbp1 in glia-to-neuron conversion was examined in the mature retina. To specifically and permanently label the retinal MG, we injected AAV-GFAP-GFP-Cre into the eyes of Ai9 mice (Rosa-CAG-LSL-tdTomato-WPRE) to induce tdTomato expression specifically in MGs ( Figures S1 B and S1C). We also constructed AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 (with gRNAs 5+6 targeting Ptbp1 ) driven by the GFAP promotor to knockdown Ptbp1 specifically in MG ( Yao et al., 2016, 2018 60. Yao, K. ∙ Qiu, S. ∙ Tian, L. ...

Restoration of vision after de novo genesis of rod photoreceptors in mammalian retinas Nature. 2018; 560 :484-488 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ) and AAV-GFAP-CasRx that does not contain Ptbp1 gRNAs as a control ( Figures 2 A and S1 D). At 1 month after subretinal co-injection of AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 and AAV-GFAP-Cre-GFP into the eyes of 5-week Ai9 mice retinas, we found that many tdTomato + cells co-immunostained with RGC markers Brn3a or Rbpms in retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) (tdTomato + Brn3a + , 18 ± 2 cells per 1 mm × 10 μm; tdTomato + Rbpms + , 18 ± 2 cells per 1 mm × 10 μm), but no such cell in the retina injected with control AAV vectors ( Figure 2 B–2E), suggesting conversion of MG to RGCs in the mature retina. Notably, converted RGC cells frequently showed low expression of GFAP-driven GFP ( Figure S1 E), consistent with the loss of glial identity after MG-to-RGC conversion. Interestingly, we observed a fraction of tdTomato + cells in the GCL expressing Foxp2 + , Brn3c + , or Parvalbumin + ( Figures S1 F–S1H), markers of F-RGCs, RGCs subtype 3, and PV-RGCs, respectively ( Rheaume et al., 2018; Rousso et al., 2016 45. Rheaume, B.A. ∙ Jereen, A. ∙ Bolisetty, M. ... Single cell transcriptome profiling of retinal ganglion cells identifies cellular subtypes Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2759 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Rousso, D.L. ∙ Qiao, M. ∙ Kagan, R.D. ... Two Pairs of ON and OFF Retinal Ganglion Cells Are Defined by Intersectional Patterns of Transcription Factor Expression Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :1930-1944 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that MG were converted into different subtypes of RGCs. Successful induction of RGCs was also confirmed by another strategy at 2–3 weeks after co-injecting AAV-GFAP-mCherry and AAV-EFS-CasRx- Ptbp1 (CasRx driven by the ubiquitous promoter EFS) into the retinas of C57BL/6 mice ( Figures S2 A–S2E). Together, our results showed that RGCs could be efficiently converted from MG via Ptbp1 knockdown in the mature retina. Previous studies showed that overexpression of Ascl1 or a cocktail of transcription factors could convert MG into different types of retinal neurons in the mature retina ( Jorstad et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2018 26. Jorstad, N.L. ∙ Wilken, M.S. ∙ Grimes, W.N. ... Stimulation of functional neuronal regeneration from Müller glia in adult mice Nature. 2017; 548 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Yao, K. ∙ Qiu, S. ∙ Wang, Y.V. ... Restoration of vision after de novo genesis of rod photoreceptors in mammalian retinas Nature. 2018; 560 :484-488 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also found that, besides RGCs, MG could also be converted into amacrine cells by CasRx-mediated knockdown of Ptbp1 ( Figures S3 A–S3C).
To explore whether MG-derived RGCs could replenish RGCs in retina injury mouse model, we intravitreally injected 4- to 8-week-old Ai9 mice with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 200 mM), which causes a near complete loss of RGCs and the reduction of the thickness of inner plexiform layer (IPL) ( Niwa et al., 2016 41. Niwa, M. ∙ Aoki, H. ∙ Hirata, A. ... Retinal Cell Degeneration in Animal Models Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016; 17 :E110 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two to three weeks after NMDA injection, the eyes were either injected with AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 plus AAV-GFAP-GFP-Cre or control AAVs ( Figures 3 A and 3B). One month after AAV injection, we found that the number of Brn3a + or Rbpms + cells (Brn3a + , 21 ± 4 cells per 1 mm × 10 μm, as compared to 4 ± 1 cells per 1 mm × 10 μm in untreated injured retina and 117 ± 8 cells per 1 mm × 10 μm in uninjured retina; Rbpms + , 34 ± 3 cells per 1 mm × 10 μm, as compared to 6 ± 1 cells per 1 mm × 10 μm in untreated injured retina and 143 ± 5 cells per 1 mm × 10 μm in uninjured retina) in the GCL was significantly elevated in retinas injected with AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 , and the majority of these cells were tdTomato + ( Figures 3 C–3F). Moreover, more than half the tdTomato + cells in GCL expressed Brn3a and Rbpms ( Figures 3 C–3F). To determine whether MG-derived RGCs integrate into the retinal circuits and have the capacity of receiving visual information, we performed cell-attached recording from MG-derived RGCs under two-photon microscope to monitor light stimulus-evoked responses ( Figure 3 G). We found that 6 out of 8 cells examined showed action potentials in response to light stimulation ( Figure 3 H). Among these cells, five were ON cells and one was an OFF cell ( Figure 3 H). These results suggested that functional RGCs could be converted from MG via Ptbp1 knockdown in the injured retina.
In the visual system, visual information is relayed by RGC projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and superior colliculus (SC) in the brain ( Figure 4 A). In the CasRx-treated NMDA-injured retina, we observed a large amount of tdTomato + axons in the treated retina and the optic nerve, but no such axons in control AAV-treated group ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Remarkably, we found tdTomato + axons in the dLGN and SC, which were much more abundant in the contralateral than the ipsilateral side of the brain ( Figures 4 D and 4E), consistent with expectation that newly formed axon projections of the converted RGCs correctly send their projections to their central target areas ( Assali et al., 2017; Rebsam et al., 2009 3. Assali, A. ∙ Le Magueresse, C. ∙ Bennis, M. ... RIM1/2 in retinal ganglion cells are required for the refinement of ipsilateral axons and eye-specific segregation Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :3236 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar 44. Rebsam, A. ∙ Petros, T.J. ∙ Mason, C.A. Switching retinogeniculate axon laterality leads to normal targeting but abnormal eye-specific segregation that is activity dependent J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :14855-14863 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The function of central projections of MG-derived RGCs was further examined by monitoring visual responses evoked by the light stimulus applied to the NMDA-injured retina. Visually evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anaesthetized mice 1 month after AAVs injection ( Figure 4 F). Striking VEPs were evoked by stimulus to the contralateral retina in NMDA-injured mice treated with AAV-GFPA-CasRx- Ptbp1 and AAV-GFAP-mCherry, similar to that found in wild-type uninjured mice, whereas only weak responses were observed in the control NMDA-injured mice injected with control AAV vectors ( Figures 4 G and 4H). This supports the notion that central projection to dLGN had restored at least partially visual information relay to V1, presumably by making synaptic connections with existing functional dLGN neurons in the brain. Finally, we explored whether CasRx-mediated conversion of MG to RGCs could restore vision-dependent behavior that was lost by NMDA-induced retinal injury ( Figure 4 I). We found that bilateral intravitreal NMDA injection in mice resulted in a reduced duration in the dark compartment in a light/dark preference test, consistent with a loss of vision due to retina injury. By contrast, CasRx-mediated MG-to-RGC conversion in both eyes of bilaterally retina-injured mice resulted in a marked increase in the duration in dark compartment, to a level close to that found for control uninjured mice ( Figure 4 J), consistent with the restoration of vision-dependent behaviors.
Next, we determined the time course of appearance of MG-to-RGC conversion and central projections in the intact retinas without NMDA-induced injury, by performing immunostaining at five different time points (1 week, 1.5 weeks, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 1 month) after AAV injection. We found that tdTomato + Rbpms + and tdTomato + Brn3a + cells in the retina were first seen at 1.5 week after the AAV injection, and the number of these cells progressively increased over time ( Figures S4 A and S4B). We noted that there was an intermediate stage showing that induced RGCs migrated from INL to GCL at 1.5 week after the AAV injection ( Figure S4 C). The time course of MG-to-RGC conversion was also demonstrated in the retina with NMDA-induced injury ( Figure S4 D). For the central projection, we found progressive increase in the tdTomato + axons in the visual pathway: labeled axons were not found in the optic nerve at 1 week ( Figure 5 A) and began to appear in contralateral dLGN at 1.5 week ( Figure 5 B) after the AAV injection. Labeled projections were first observed in the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, SC by 2 weeks ( Figure 5 C) and clearly observed in both contralateral and ipsilateral dLGN and SC by 3 weeks, with further increased on both sides at 1 month ( Figures 5 B–5D). Similar findings were also observed in the injured retinas injected with NMDA ( Figures S5 A–S5C).
To generalize the potential usefulness of CasRx-induced glia-to-neuron conversion in other systems, we further examined whether knockdown of Ptbp1 in the striatum could locally convert other types of cells into dopamine neurons, an approach that may be useful for replenishing dopamine in the striatum due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in midbrain substantia nigra associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). We first injected wild-type mice with AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 (with gRNAs 5+6 for Ptbp1 ) into the striatum to downregulate Ptbp1 , together with AAV-GFAP-mCherry that fluorescently labeled astrocytes ( Figures S6 A and S6B). As a control, we used AAV-GFAP-CasRx that does not contain Ptbp1 gRNA. We found that both mCherry and CasRx were largely expressed in astrocytes and showed a high co-infection efficiency in the striatum, with 99% ± 1% mCherry + cells expressed CasRx (82% ± 2% GFAP + cells expressed mCherry, and 95% ± 1% mCherry + cells expressed GFAP). The absolute number of CasRx-infected cell was 40 ± 8 Flag + cells per 200 μm × 200 μm × 10 μm ( Figures S6 C and S6D). The expression of Ptbp1 was downregulated in astrocytes 1 week after co-injecting AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 and AAV-GFAP-mCherry into the striatum ( Figures S6 E and S6F), and a high percentage (48% ± 10%, SEM, n = 6 mice) of mCherry + cells expressed mature neuron markers NeuN at 1 month after AAV injection but not in the control striatum injected with AAV-GFAP-mCherry and AAV-GFAP-CasRx (0.97% ± 0.45%, SEM, n = 6 mice) ( Figures S6 G and S6H). The neuronal type of these converted cells was further examined by immunostaining of cell-type-specific markers. We found that around 50% of converted neurons expressed glutaminase ( Figures S6 I and S6J), a marker of excitatory glutamatergic neurons ( Kaneko et al., 1995 27. Kaneko, T. ∙ Kang, Y. ∙ Mizuno, N. Glutaminase-positive and glutaminase-negative pyramidal cells in layer VI of the primary motor and somatosensory cortices: a combined analysis by intracellular staining and immunocytochemistry in the rat J. Neurosci. 1995; 15 :8362-8377 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), very few converted neurons expressed an interneuron subtype marker somatostatin (SST), and no cell expressed another interneuron subtype marker parvalbumin (PV) ( Figures S6 K and S6L). Co-staining of dopamine neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) with NeuN showed that a fraction of (7.5% ± 3%, SEM) mCherry + cells expressed TH, but contained a low level of NeuN ( Figures S6 M–S6O), similar to that found previously in rodent midbrain TH + dopamine neurons ( Cannon and Greenamyre, 2009 7. Cannon, J.R. ∙ Greenamyre, J.T. NeuN is not a reliable marker of dopamine neurons in rat substantia nigra Neurosci. Lett. 2009; 464 :14-17 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, we found that the expression of AAV-GFAP-mCherry in converted neurons persisted for at least 1 month after infection ( Figure S6 G), consistent with previous reports ( Liu et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018 36.

To explore the potential in vivo effect of CasRx-mediated neuronal reprogramming in the striatum, we used a mouse model of PD generated by unilateral infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the right medial forebrain bundle ( Boix et al., 2015; Heuer et al., 2012; Iancu et al., 2005; Thiele et al., 2012 5.

Thiele, S.L. ∙ Warre, R. ∙ Nash, J.E. Development of a unilaterally-lesioned 6-OHDA mouse model of Parkinson’s disease J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 3234 PubMed Google Scholar ). This infusion induces the loss of dopamine neurons in the ipsilateral ventral midbrain and degeneration of dopaminergic projection in the ipsilateral striatum ( Figures S7 A–S7C). Three weeks after 6-OHDA infusion, AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 (or AAV-GFAP-CasRx as a control) together with AAV-GFAP-mCherry were injected into the ipsilateral striatum. Analysis of striatal cell types was performed at different time points after AAV injection ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Interestingly, we found that 6-OHDA-lesioned mice injected with AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 and AAV-GFAP-mCherry showed a high percentage of cells expressing both TH and mCherry at 1 month after injection, and the percentage increased at 3 months (19% ± 0.4%, SEM, n = 5 mice, at 1 month; 32% ± 7%, SEM, n = 3 mice, at 3 months) ( Figures 6 C, 6D, S7 D, and S7E). Such cells were rarely observed in mice at 1 and 2 weeks after injection or injected with control AAVs ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S7 D–S7F). In addition, around 80% of TH + cells in the virus-injected region were mCherry + ( Figures 6 E and S7 G), suggesting that they were mainly derived from astrocytes. We note that the percentage of mCherry + TH + cells in mCherry + cells in wild-type (non-PD without 6-OHDA lesion) mice was lower than that of 6-OHDA lesioned mice ( Figure S7 H), suggesting that endogenous repair mechanisms may promote the induction of TH + neurons after injury. We also examined whether induced neurons expressed the mature dopamine neuron marker dopamine transporter Slc6a3 (DAT), which is present in midbrain dopamine neurons but absent in the lesion-induced transiently TH-expressing striatal neurons ( Darmopil et al., 2008 12. Darmopil, S. ∙ Muñetón-Gómez, V.C. ∙ de Ceballos, M.L. ... Tyrosine hydroxylase cells appearing in the mouse striatum after dopamine denervation are likely to be projection neurones regulated by L-DOPA Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27 :580-592 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found a high percentage (10% ± 3%, SEM, n = 5 mice, at 1 month; 31% ± 7%, SEM, n = 3 mice, at 3 months) of mCherry + DAT + cells in the AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 -injected striatum but not in mice injected with the control AAV ( Figures 6 C, 6F, S7 D, and S7I). Further co-immunostaining of TH and DAT revealed that the majority of mCherry + TH + cells expressed DAT ( Figures 6 C, 6G, and S7 D), indicating that most induced neurons expressed the mature dopaminergic marker. In addition, mCherry + cells expressed two other midbrain dopamine neuron markers, DOPA-decarboxylase (DDC) and forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) ( Figures S7 J–S7M), further characterizing the dopaminergic features of converted neurons.

Here, we have evaluated the appearance of induced TH + interneurons, shown by PV + , SST + , and calretinin + (CR + ) cells ( Rivetti di Val Cervo et al., 2017; Ünal et al., 2015 46.

To explore the subtype identity of induced neurons, we co-immunostained TH with two SNc A9 area-specific dopamine neuron markers, ALDH1A1 and GIRK2, respectively ( Grealish et al., 2014; Kriks et al., 2011; Vogt Weisenhorn et al., 2016 20.

Neurochem. 2016; 139 :8-26 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results showed that almost all induced neurons expressed ALDH1A1 and GIRK2 but not calbindin ( Figures 6 H-6J), suggesting that induced neurons shared many characteristics with SNc dopamine neurons.
Whole-cell recording was performed on striatal slices of injected mice. We found that the majority of neuron-like mCherry + cells (20 out of 22 cells) were capable of generating repetitive action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection in the current-clamp mode ( Figure 6 K). We also observed spontaneous postsynaptic currents in the voltage-clamp mode (Vc = −70 mV), indicating that converted neurons received functional synaptic inputs ( Figures 6 L and 6M). Moreover, in 4 out of 10 neurons examined, we observed delayed voltage rectification ( Figure 6 K) induced by hyperpolarization-activated currents (I h ), a signature of midbrain dopamine neurons ( Engel, 2016 15. Engel, D. Subcellular Patch-clamp Recordings from the Somatodendritic Domain of Nigral Dopamine Neurons J. Vis. Exp. 2016; Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar ). To determine whether induced neurons could release dopamine, we performed immunostaining and found that the majority of mCherry + TH + cells expressed vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) ( Figure 6 N), an essential protein that regulates the packaging, storage, and release of dopamine ( Liu and Edwards, 1997 35. Liu, Y. ∙ Edwards, R.H. The role of vesicular transport proteins in synaptic transmission and neural degeneration Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20 :125-156 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further found that many cells in the virus-injected striatum region showed uptake of a fluorescent dopamine derivative (FFN206), an VMAT2 substrate that is able to detect active VMAT2 in intact cells ( Hu et al., 2013; Kiyoi et al., 2018; Rivetti di Val Cervo et al., 2017 22. Hu, G. ∙ Henke, A. ∙ Karpowicz, Jr., R.J. ... New fluorescent substrate enables quantitative and high-throughput examination of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 :1947-1954 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Kiyoi, T. ∙ Liu, S. ∙ Sahid, M.N.A. ... High-throughput screening system for dynamic monitoring of exocytotic vesicle trafficking in mast cells PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0198785 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar 46. Rivetti di Val Cervo, P. ∙ Romanov, R.A. ∙ Spigolon, G. ... Induction of functional dopamine neurons from human astrocytes in vitro and mouse astrocytes in a Parkinson’s disease model Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :444-452 Crossref Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ), and partial reduction of the fluorescence upon high KCl treatment, suggesting the capability of dopamine release function of the converted cells ( Figures 6 O–6Q). Based on the expression of VMAT2 in the soma, and the reduction of FFN206 in the soma after KCl treatment, we speculate that release of dopamine from soma is the most likely mechanism, although release from neurites could not be excluded. Taken together, our results showed that CasRx-mediated Ptbp1 knockdown could efficiently induce neurons showing features of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum of PD model mice.
We further examined whether induced neurons in the striatum could alleviate the symptoms in the 6-OHDA-induced PD mouse model ( Figure 7 A). The motor functions were evaluated for drug-induced and drug-free activities. For drug-induced activities, we first examined apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation behavior, which is widely used for demonstrating unilateral dopamine neuronal loss ( Brooks and Dunnett, 2009 6. Brooks, S.P. ∙ Dunnett, S.B. Tests to assess motor phenotype in mice: a user’s guide Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10 :519-529 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that apomorphine-induced net rotation (counted as contralateral-ipsilateral rotation number) was significantly diminished in Ptbp1 -knockdown mice (injected with AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 and AAV-GFAP-mCherry), as compared to control mice (injected with AAV-GFAP-CasRx and AAV-GFAP-mCherry or with saline), to the level comparable to that found in non-lesioned wide-type mice ( Figures 7 B, S7 O, and S7P). Another ipsilateral preferred rotation behavior induced by systemic amphetamine administration ( Brooks and Dunnett, 2009 6. Brooks, S.P. ∙ Dunnett, S.B. Tests to assess motor phenotype in mice: a user’s guide Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10 :519-529 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ), which increases intercellular dopamine concentration by inhibiting dopamine re-uptake of DAT in the striatum ( Freyberg et al., 2016; Miller, 2011 17. Freyberg, Z. ∙ Sonders, M.S. ∙ Aguilar, J.I. ... Mechanisms of amphetamine action illuminated through optical monitoring of dopamine synaptic vesicles in Drosophila brain Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10652 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Miller, G.M. The emerging role of trace amine-associated receptor 1 in the functional regulation of monoamine transporters and dopaminergic activity J. Neurochem. 2011; 116 :164-176 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), also showed marked reduction of net rotation (counted as ipsilateral-contralateral rotation number) and ipsilateral rotation ratio (counted as ipsilateral/total rotation number) in mice injected with AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1, as compared to control mice ( Figures 7 C, 7D, and S7 Q). These results suggest that induced neurons in the striatum could release sufficient dopamine to reduce motor dysfunction revealed by the drug-induced rotation behavior in the PD model mice. In addition, we examined two drug-free motor dysfunctions, the forelimb-use asymmetry and motor coordination, using cylinder and rotarod tests, respectively ( Brooks and Dunnett, 2009 6. Brooks, S.P. ∙ Dunnett, S.B. Tests to assess motor phenotype in mice: a user’s guide Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10 :519-529 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that mice injected with AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 also showed significantly lower percentages of ipsilateral touches of the cylinder and longer duration on the rotarod, as compared to control mice ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Together, these results suggested that Ptbp1 knockdown-mediated neuron conversion in the striatum alleviated the motor dysfunctions in the PD mouse model.

Section: Discussion

In this work, we showed that glial cells could be efficiently converted to neurons in a region-dependent manner by CasRx-mediated downregulation of an RNA-binding protein Ptbp1 . In a NMDA-induced retina injury model, this Ptbp1 knockdown led to MG-to-RGC conversion in the injured retina that at least partially restored visual responses in the central visual pathway and a vision-dependent behavior. In a 6-OHDA-induced PD mouse model, it led to appearance of neurons with dopaminergic features in the striatum, and the alleviation of motor dysfunction associated with dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra. These results suggest that downregulating expression of a single RNA binding protein is sufficient to transform glial cells into different types of neurons in brain regions undergoing neuronal loss, providing a new approach for therapeutic application.
The REST complex is responsible for silencing a large number of neuron-specific transcription factors ( Yeo et al., 2005 62. Yeo, M. ∙ Lee, S.K. ∙ Lee, B. ... Small CTD phosphatases function in silencing neuronal gene expression Science. 2005; 307 :596-600 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ), and its activity could be suppressed by miR-124, which is strongly inhibited by the binding protein PTBP1 in non-neuronal cells ( Xue et al., 2013; Yeo et al., 2005 59. Xue, Y. ∙ Ouyang, K. ∙ Huang, J. ... Direct conversion of fibroblasts to neurons by reprogramming PTB-regulated microRNA circuits Cell. 2013; 152 :82-96 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Yeo, M. ∙ Lee, S.K. ∙ Lee, B. ... Small CTD phosphatases function in silencing neuronal gene expression Science. 2005; 307 :596-600 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, downregulation of Ptbp1 releases miR-124 activity, which suppresses REST complex, leading to expression of neuron-specific transcription factors ( Xue et al., 2013 59. Xue, Y. ∙ Ouyang, K. ∙ Huang, J. ... Direct conversion of fibroblasts to neurons by reprogramming PTB-regulated microRNA circuits Cell. 2013; 152 :82-96 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, our finding that Ptbp1 knockdown in glial cells led to conversion into different neuronal types in the retina versus the striatum indicates that the activation of neuronal type-specific transcription factors resulting from REST suppression depends on either the glial cell type (astrocytes versus MG) or the environmental cues (in striatum versus retina), or both ( Grande et al., 2013; Vignoles et al., 2019 19.

Direct Lineage Reprogramming for Brain Repair: Breakthroughs and Challenges Trends Mol. Med. 2019; 25 :897-914 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar situation was found for Ascl1-induced conversion of astrocyte-to-GABAergic neuron and MG-to-bipolar cell in the midbrain and retina, respectively ( Jorstad et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2015 26. Jorstad, N.L. ∙ Wilken, M.S. ∙ Grimes, W.N. ...

Ascl1 Converts Dorsal Midbrain Astrocytes into Functional Neurons In Vivo J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :9336-9355 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). To bring in vivo direct cell type conversion closer to clinical application in various types of brain dysfunctions, it is important to identify the instructive signals underlying glia-to-neuron conversion in the future. For clinical application, cell-transplantation based approaches could replenish the required cell types in various brain regions, although major hurdles remain to be overcome, such as the low viability and integration of transplanted cells in functional circuits ( Chen et al., 2016; Grealish et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011; Kriks et al., 2011; Rivetti di Val Cervo et al., 2017; Torper et al., 2013; Yoo et al., 2017 9.

Electromagnetized gold nanoparticles mediate direct lineage reprogramming into induced dopamine neurons in vivo for Parkinson’s disease therapy Nat. Nanotechnol. 2017; 12 :1006-1014 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). The alternative approach of glia-to-neuron conversion in vivo has previously been examined by expressing one or more specific transcription factors ( Jopling et al., 2011; Mertens et al., 2016 25. Jopling, C. ∙ Boue, S. ∙ Izpisua Belmonte, J.C. Dedifferentiation, transdifferentiation and reprogramming: three routes to regeneration Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :79-89 Crossref Scopus (525) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Mertens, J. ∙ Marchetto, M.C. ∙ Bardy, C. ... Evaluating cell reprogramming, differentiation and conversion technologies in neuroscience Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :424-437 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). The present approach of CasRx-mediated Ptbp1 downregulation aims to achieve the similar goal of conversion by knocking down a key endogenous factor that gates the activity of REST complex. The glia-derived neurons appeared to be stable for as long as the observation was made (up to 3 months). Notably, we found that MG-derived RGCs could establish central projection in the brain and relayed visual information to the dLGN neurons. Such demonstration of circuit integration is critical for the cell-replacement therapy of brain dysfunction.
The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) technologies, which enable cleavage or inhibition of desired transcripts, have significant off-target effects ( Birmingham et al., 2006; Jackson et al., 2003 4. Birmingham, A. ∙ Anderson, E.M. ∙ Reynolds, A. ... 3′ UTR seed matches, but not overall identity, are associated with RNAi off-targets Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 :199-204 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Jackson, A.L. ∙ Bartz, S.R. ∙ Schelter, J. ... Expression profiling reveals off-target gene regulation by RNAi Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21 :635-637 Crossref Scopus (1992) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cas13-mediated knockdown has an efficiency comparable to or higher than RNAi knockdown, but has substantially reduced off-target effects ( Abudayyeh et al., 2017; Cox et al., 2017; Konermann et al., 2018 2. Abudayyeh, O.O. ∙ Gootenberg, J.S. ∙ Essletzbichler, P. ... RNA targeting with CRISPR-Cas13 Nature. 2017; 550 :280-284 Crossref Scopus (1377) PubMed Google Scholar 11. Cox, D.B.T. ∙ Gootenberg, J.S. ∙ Abudayyeh, O.O. ... RNA editing with CRISPR-Cas13 Science. 2017; 358 :1019-1027 Crossref Scopus (1228) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Konermann, S. ∙ Lotfy, P. ∙ Brideau, N.J. ... Transcriptome Engineering with RNA-Targeting Type VI-D CRISPR Effectors Cell. 2018; 173 :665-676 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (728) PubMed Google Scholar ), making it potentially more useful for therapeutic applications. In addition, CasRx has the smallest size among Cas13 family of proteins, allowing AAV packaging when paired with a CRISPR array (encoding multiple guide RNAs). For the gene-editing field, the use of RNA-targeting CRISPR system CasRx could avoid the risk associated with permanent DNA alteration caused by the standard CRISPR-Cas9 editing ( Kosicki et al., 2018; Shin et al., 2017 32. Kosicki, M. ∙ Tomberg, K. ∙ Bradley, A. Erratum: Repair of double-strand breaks induced by CRISPR-Cas9 leads to large deletions and complex rearrangements Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :899 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Shin, H.Y. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Lee, H.K. ... CRISPR/Cas9 targeting events cause complex deletions and insertions at 17 sites in the mouse genome Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15464 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus potentially less risky for clinical application. While previous reports claimed that Cas13 could induce collateral cleavage of RNA in human cells by targeting exogenous overexpressed genes ( Wang et al., 2019 57. Wang, Q. ∙ Liu, X. ∙ Zhou, J. ... The CRISPR-Cas13a Gene-Editing System Induces Collateral Cleavage of RNA in Glioma Cells Adv. Sci. (Weinh.). 2019; 6 :1901299 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is of interest to know whether CasRx also induces collateral damage during therapeutic applications, with only short-term CasRx-mediated targeting of endogenous genes. Our work also demonstrated the efficiency of RNA editing by CasRx in vivo , which may become useful not only for cell replacement but also for treating other diseases that require downregulation of specific gene products.

C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co.,Ltd, and Ai9 mice (JAX#007909) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. Only C57BL/6 mice were used in PD-related experiments, and both C57BL/6 and Ai9 mice were used in retina-related experiments. All mice used in this study were housed in a 12 hours light/dark cycle room with water and food ad libitum. Only male mice were used in behavior tests and the ages of mice were indicated in Figures, Figure legends and Method. All animal experiments were performed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.
The N2a cell line was obtained from Cell bank of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (SIBCB), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 37°C incubator under 5% CO 2 .
Isolation and culture of astrocytes were performed as previously described ( McCarthy and de Vellis, 1980 37. McCarthy, K.D. ∙ de Vellis, J. Preparation of separate astroglial and oligodendroglial cell cultures from rat cerebral tissue J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85 :890-902 Crossref Scopus (3520) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the P0 mouse was euthanized by decapitation and the mouse brain was isolated after peeling off the skin and skull. The cortex was dissected from the intact brain and divided into two hemispheres after removing hippocampus, meninges and blood vessels on ice. Then the tissues were cut in pieces and digested with papain in 37°C incubator for 10 min. Digested tissues were triturated into single cell by passing through pipette tips gently, and then the dissociated cells were centrifuged (1000rpm, 5min) and the pellet was re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10ng/ml hFGF and 10ng/ml hEGF. These mixed cells were grown in culture flasks and the medium was half-replaced every 3 days. After 7 days, the flasks were shaken in 37°C for 12 hours and the medium were discarded. Purified astrocytes were digested from flasks and seeded in 6-well plates or 10-cm dishes for the following experiments.
Transient transfection was conducted with 4 μg vectors expressing Ptbp1 -CasRx-GFP according to the standard procedure using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Control plasmids do not express gRNA. Around two days after transient transfection, GFP-positive cells were collected by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and lysed for qPCR analysis. RNA was first extracted using Trizol (Ambion) and then converted to cDNA using a reverse transcription kit (HiScript Q RT SuperMix for qPCR, Vazyme, Biotech). The amplification was tracked by AceQ qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Biotech). For astrocytes RNA-seq, astrocytes were cultured in 10-cm dishes and infected with lentivirus. Around 60000 positive cells were isolated by FACS, RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA, which was used for RNA-seq. An average of the two repeats is presented. For N2a cells, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 7 μg vectors expressing gRNA-CasRx-GFP according to the standard procedure using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two days after transfection, around 50000 GFP-positive cells per sample were collected by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and lysed for qPCR analysis. Retinas were also isolated to determine the expression of AAVs. For N2a cell RNA-seq, N2a cells were cultured in 15-cm dish and transient transfection was conducted with 70 μg plasmids. ~500000 GFP-positive (GFP top 20%) N2a cells were collected by FACS, and RNA was extracted and then converted to cDNA, which was used for transcriptome-wide RNA-seq. RNA-seq data was analyzed as previously described ( Zhou et al., 2018 65. Zhou, H. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Zhou, C. ... In vivo simultaneous transcriptional activation of multiple genes in the brain using CRISPR-dCas9-activator transgenic mice Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :440-446 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) and presented as the mean of all repeats. The mRNA sequencing (high-throughput) was performed using Illumina Genome Analyzer and the adapters were removed using Trimmomatic (v0.36) during sequencing. The hisat2 (v2.0.0) was used to map qualified reads to the mouse reference genome (mm10) with default parameters. Then, the expression levels of all mapped genes were estimated by stringtie (v2.0) and the gene expression abundances were indicated by FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped). All data could be accessed with the SRA number PRJNA610168.
The procedure was based on previous study ( Su et al., 2018 50. Su, J. ∙ Huang, P. ∙ Qin, M. ... Reduction of HIP2 expression causes motor function impairment and increased vulnerability to dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinson’s disease models Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :1020 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, adult C57BL/6 mice (aged ~10 weeks) received i.p. injection of 25 mg/kg of Desipramine hydrochloride half-hour before anesthesia. After anesthesia, mice were injected with 3 μg 6-OHDA or saline into right medial forebrain bundle according to the following coordinates: anteroposterior (A/P) = −1.2 mm, mediolateral (M/L) = −1.1 mm, dorsoventral (D/V) = −5 mm. All mice were delivered 1 mL of 4% glucose-saline solution subcutaneously 1 hour after surgery. Mice were typically allowed to recover for 3 weeks feeding with soaked food pellets.
AAV-PhP.eb ( Chan et al., 2017 8. Chan, K.Y. ∙ Jang, M.J. ∙ Yoo, B.B. ... Engineered AAVs for efficient noninvasive gene delivery to the central and peripheral nervous systems Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :1172-1179 Crossref Scopus (817) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used in this study. Stereotactic injections were performed as previously described ( Zhou et al., 2014 64. Zhou, H. ∙ Lin, Z. ∙ Voges, K. ... Cerebellar modules operate at different frequencies eLife. 2014; 3 :e02536 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mice were placed in a stereotactic frame. Next, the skin over the skull was shaven and opened using a razor. A craniotomy with coordinates (AP +0.8 mm, ML ± 1.6 mm) was made over the boundary of frontal and parietal bones, allowing the placement of a injection micropipette (~20 μm outside diameter at the tip). The injection micropipette was advanced into the striatum using a micromanipulator and the contents in the pipette were released using a hydraulic manipulator. The viral solution containing either AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 +AAV-GFAP-mCherry or AAV-GFAP-CasRx+AAV-GFAP-mCherry was injected slowly (~6 minutes/μl). Mice were injected in the striatum (AP +0.8 mm, ML ± 1.6 mm and DV −2.8 mm) with high-titer AAVs (> 1 × 10 13 vg/ml, 1.5 μL for non-lesioned mice aged 8-10 weeks and 3 μL for 6-OHDA-lesioned mice aged around 13 weeks). The volume ratio between GFAP-mCherry and GFAP-CasRx or GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1 were 1:15. Immunofluorescence staining was performed at different time points after AAV injection. The brains were perfused and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight, and kept in 30% sucrose for at least 12 hours. Brains were sectioned after embedding and freezing, and slices with the thickness of 30 μm were used for immunofluorescence staining. Brain sections were rinsed thoroughly with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Primary antibodies: Rabbit anti-PTBP1 (1:1000, PA581297, Invitrogen), Rabbit-anti-NeuN (1:500, ABN78, Millipore), Rabbit-anti-NeuN (1:500, 24307S, Cell Signaling Technology), Guinea Pig anti-NeuN antibody (1:500, ABN90, Millipore), Mouse anti-Flag (1:2000, F3165, Sigma), Rabbit anti-TH antibody (1:500, AB152, Millipore), Rat anti-DAT (1:100, MAB369, Millipore), Rabbit anti-DDC antibody (1:400, ab3905, Abcam), Rabbit anti-FOXA2 antibody (1:50, ab108422, Abcam) Rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (1:500, Z0334, DAKO), Mouse anti-ALDH1A1 antibody (1:50, 60171-1-Ig, Proteintech), Goat anti-GIRK2 antibody (1:100, ab65096, Abcam), Rabbit anti-Calbindin antibody (1:1000, 14479-1-AP, Proteintech), Goat anti-VMAT2 antibody (1:50, EB06558, Everest biotech), Rabbit anti-glutaminase antibody (1:50,12855-1-AP, Proteintech), Mouse anti-parvalbumin(PV) antibody (1:2000, P3088, Sigma), Guinea Pig anti-somatostatin-28(SST) antibody (1:500, 366004, Synaptic Systems), Mouse anti-calretinin(CR) antibody (1:100, 66496-1-Ig, Proteintech).

After antibody incubation, slices were washed and covered with mountant (Life Technology). Images were visualized under an Olympus FV3000 microscope.
NMDA and AAVs (AAV-PHP.eB) were introduced via intravitreal and subretinal injection, respectively, as previously described ( Chiu et al., 2007; Qi et al., 2015 10. Chiu, K. ∙ Chang, R.C. ∙ So, K.F. Intravitreous injection for establishing ocular diseases model J. Vis. Exp. 2007; 313 PubMed Google Scholar 42. Qi, Y. ∙ Dai, X. ∙ Zhang, H. ... Trans-Corneal Subretinal Injection in Mice and Its Effect on the Function and Morphology of the Retina PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0136523 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). For intravitreal injection, the pipettes were prepared using a puller and connected with a 1 mL syringe. Then mice were anaesthetized with 0.35 mL 2% Tribromoethanol and one drop of 0.5% alcaine was droped on the eye before intravitreous injection. Around 1.5 μL NMDA solution (200mM) was injected into the vitreous body using the pipette. After injection, ofloxacin eye ointment was applied on the eye to prevent infection. For subretinal injection, mice were aneathetized and the pupil size was dilated with Tropicamide Phenylephrine Eye drops. Then one drop of sodium hyaluronate was droped on the cornea to enable better visualization. A penetration was made in the cornea under a Olympus microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) using a 30G needle. Next, a Hamilton syringe (32G needle) was inserted into the eye via corneal perforation. To inject AAVs (high titer: > 1 × 10 13 vg/ml) into the subretinal space, an inner retina area with low density of blood vessels was penetrated with the needle and ~1 μL content was injected into the subretinal space with slow speed (taking up to 20 s). After injection, the injection needle was removed slowly and a drop of ofloxacin eye ointment was administrated. To determine the conversion in intact retinas, in total 1 μL AAV-GFAP-GFP-Cre (0.2 μl) and AAV-GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1 (0.8 μl), or AAV-GFAP-Cre-GFP (0.2 μl) and AAV-GFAP-CasRx (0.8 μl) were delivered to the retina via subretinal injection (Ai9 and C57BL/6 mice, 5 weeks old). To determine the reprogramming in damaged retinas, NMDA was dissolved in the PBS with a final concentration of 200 mM and 1.5 μL NMDA solution was delivered to the eye of Ai9 mice aged 4-8 weeks or C57BL/6 mice aged 5-6 weeks (For VEP and dark/light preference test) via intravitreal injection. Two-three weeks after NMDA injection, AAV-GFAP-GFP-Cre together with AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 or AAV-GFAP-CasRx were co-delivered to the retina via subretinal injection. To evaluate the functional rescue of injured retinas (VEP and light/dark transition test), retinal injury was induced in mice aged 5-6 weeks (C57BL/6) by NMDA injection and AAV-GFAP-mCherry (0.2 μl) mixtured with AAV-GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1 (0.8 μl) or AAV- GFAP-CasRx (0.8 μl) were delivered 2-3 weeks after NMDA injection. The eyes, optic nerves and brain were extracted at different time points after AAV injection and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2 (for eyes and optic nerves) or 24 (for brains) hours, then maintain in a 30% sucrose solution for 2 (for eyes) or 24 (for brains) hours. After embedding and freezing, eyes and brains were sectioned with the thickness of 30 μm. After incubation, slices were washed and covered with mountant (Life Technology). Images were visualized under an Olympus FV3000 microscope.
Electrophysiological recordings were performed as previously described ( Xu et al., 2014 58. Xu, H.T. ∙ Han, Z. ∙ Gao, P. ... Distinct lineage-dependent structural and functional organization of the hippocampus Cell. 2014; 157 :1552-1564 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with ice-code NMDG artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) [NMDG aCSF (mM): NMDG 93, KCl 2.5, NaH 2 PO 4 1.25, NaHCO 3 30, HEPES 20, glucose 25, thiourea 2, sodium ascorbate 5, sodium pyruvate 3, N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) 12, CaCl 2 0.5, MgSO 4 10] gassed with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 at room temperature. The brains were extracted after perfusion and placed into the ice-cold NMDG aCSF solution for 30 s. The brains were trimmed and sectioned at 300 μm thickness with the speed of 0.04–0.05 mm/s. Brain slices were moved into a chamber filled with gassed NMDG aCSF and kept at 32-34°C for ≤ 12 min. The slices were then transferred into a new chamber containing gassed recording aCSF [recording aCSF (mM): NaCl 126, KCl 3, NaH 2 PO4 1.2, NaHCO 3 26, glucose 10, CaCl 2 2.4, MgCl 1.3] at room temperature for one hour. Neuon-like (with clearly visualized large soma) mCherry-positive cells were patched under the microscope Olympus BX51WI, and data was acquired using Clampex 10.
FFN206 take-up and release experiments were performed as previously described ( Rivetti di Val Cervo et al., 2017 46. Rivetti di Val Cervo, P. ∙ Romanov, R.A. ∙ Spigolon, G. ... Induction of functional dopamine neurons from human astrocytes in vitro and mouse astrocytes in a Parkinson’s disease model Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :444-452 Crossref Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were anesthetized and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). The brains were extracted and placed into the icy-cold aCSF solution for 30 s. The brains were sectioned at 300 μm thickness. For imaging, the slices were incubated 30 minutes in the dark in ACSF containing a final concentration of 10 μM FFN 206 (ab144554, Abcam), then FFN 206 was washed out for 30 minutes with aCSF (osmotically balanced). Slices were imaged on an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope, and stimulation of FFN206 release was induced by addition KCl (wash-in) with a final concentration of 56 mM.
Mice were dark-adapted overnight before euthanasia. Dissection of the retina was performed in oxygenated (95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 ) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 26mM NaHCO 3 and 10 mM glucose under an infrared microscope at room temperature. A piece of the retina was placed with RGCs facing up in a recording chamber on the stage of an upright microscope. The tdTomato-positive cells in ganglion cell layer were identified using two-photon (λ = 1030 nm) microscopy and targeted for loose cell-attached recording under infrared light. Pipettes (4-7 MΩ) for recording were filled with ASCF and 0.25 mM Alexa488 hydradize. Recordings were acquired with a Multiclamp 700A amplifier and pClamp 10 software suite (Molecular Devices). Signals were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. The full field light stimulus was delivered by a white LED. After recording current pulses were injected to fill the cell for visualizing the morphology.
The mouse was injected with a mixture of fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg), and meditomidine (0.5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The mouse was head-fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus, and its body temperature was maintained at 37°C by means of a heating blanket. A craniotomy (~1 mm diameter) was made above both sides of the primary visual cortex (V1) (AP −3.6 to - 3.9 mm, ML 2.2 mm), and the dura was removed. Visual stimuli were presented on a 17” LCD monitor (Dell P170S, max luminance of 69 cd/m 2 ) placed 8 cm away from the eye contralateral to the recording site. The eye ipsilateral to the recording site was blocked from visual stimulation. We displayed 100 repeats of flash stimuli (full field, 100% contrast) for 2 s with an interval of 2 s. Recordings were made with multi-site silicon probes (A1 × 16-5mm-50-177, NeuroNexus Technologies) in V1 (AP −3.6 to - 3.9 mm, ML 2.2 mm), with the tip of the electrode reaching cortical depth at around 900 μm for each recording. Both the reference and ground wires were placed in a small craniotomy at least 3 mm away from the recording site. The neural responses were amplified and filtered using a Cerebus 32-channel system (Blackrock microsystems). Local field potential (LFP) signals were sampled at 2 kHz or 10 kHz with a wide-band front-end filter (0.3 – 500 Hz). The LFP responses to the full-screen flash stimuli were used for current source density (CSD) analysis to identify the location of cortical layer 4 ( Zhu et al., 2015 66. Zhu, Y. ∙ Qiao, W. ∙ Liu, K. ... Control of response reliability by parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in visual cortex Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6802 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate CSD profile, we computed the second spatial derivative of LFP by the following equation ( Freeman and Nicholson, 1975; Mitzdorf, 1985 16. Freeman, J.A. ∙ Nicholson, C. Experimental optimization of current source-density technique for anuran cerebellum J. Neurophysiol. 1975; 38 :369-382 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Mitzdorf, U. Current source-density method and application in cat cerebral cortex: investigation of evoked potentials and EEG phenomena Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65 :37-100 Crossref Scopus (1289) PubMed Google Scholar ): 𝜕 2 𝜑 𝜕 𝑧 2 ≈ 𝜑 ⁡ ( 𝑧 − 𝑛 ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝑧 ) + 𝜑 ⁡ ( 𝑧 + 𝑛 ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝑧 ) − 2 ⁢ 𝜑 ⁡ ( 𝑧 ) ( 𝑛 ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝑧 ) 2 where 𝜑 is LFP, 𝑧 is the coordinate of the recording sites, Δ ⁢ 𝑧 is the distance between adjacent recording sites, and 𝑛 ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝑧 is the differentiation grid (n = 2). Layer 4 (the granular layer) was determined as those recording sites at the initial current sink. For each mouse, we used a layer 4 channel showing the largest mean amplitude to analyze visually evoked response.
All tested mice were placed in the testing room for habituation before each test. After 30 minutes habituation, mice were i.p. injected with 0.5 mg/kg apomorphine (A4393, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in saline. After 10 minutes, each mouse was placed in an opaque cylinder (30 cm diameter) for free moving with a camera recording above for 20 min. After each trial, the cylinders were cleaned with 70% ethanol to eliminate the olfactory cues. Raw data were obtained by counting the rotation number in the video. A rotation was defined as a full-body turn with one hind-paw as center and without switching head direction. Both ipsi- (clockwise) and contra-lateral (counterclockwise) rotation was counted. Data were quantified as the net contralateral rotation number (n = contralateral rotation – ipsilateral rotation) during 20 minutes.
All mice performed amphetamine test 1 week after apomorphine test to avoid potential result interference between these two tests. After 30 minutes habituation, mice received i.p. injection of 2.5mg/kg D-amphetamine (A008, Sigma-Aldrich, the solvant was evaporated) dissolved in saline 10 minutes before starting test and then recorded with same apparatus used in apomorphine test for 40 minutes. A rotation in this test was defined as a complete 360° circling without changing direction. Videos were analyzed by EthoVision XT (version 11.5.1012) and both ipsi- (clockwise) and contra-lateral (counterclockwise) rotation was counted. Data were quantified as the net ipsilateral rotation number (n = ipsilateral rotation – contralateral rotation) and ratio of ipsilateral rotation to total rotations (n = ipsilateral rotation/ (ipsilateral + contralateral rotation)) during 40 minutes.
After habituation, each mouse was gently placed in a glass beaker (1000 mL volume) and allowed to move freely with a camera recording in front of it for 10 min. After each trial, the beakers were cleaned with 70% ethanol to eliminate the olfactory cues. Raw data were obtained by counting the paw touches on the wall in the video. Both ipsi- and contra-lateral paw touches on the wall were separately counted and data were quantified as the ratio of ipsilateral touches to total touches (n = ipsilateral touches/ (ipsilateral + contralateral touches)).
All mice were trained for 2 days before testing in the third day and both training and testing were started after habituation. On day 1, mice were trained with a fixed speed of 4rpm in a period of 300 s on rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile) for 4 times. On day 2 and 3, mice were trained and tested with a accelerate speed from 4 to 40 rpm for 4 times. The rods were cleaned with 70% ethanol after every trial to avoid potential odor cues. The time a mouse spent on rod before falling off was recorded as latency and the mean value of 3 longest latencies was used for analysis.
Both eyes were injured and injected with either AAV-GFAP-CasRx plus AAV-GFAP-mCherry or control AAVs (both eyes). The apparatus used for the light/dark transition test consists of a box divided into a small (one third) dark section and a large (two thirds) illuminated section (550 lumens) with a door. Mice were allowed to move freely between the two compartments for 10 min. The time spent in each chamber was recorded by the camera and analyzed using Ethovision XT. After each trial, the compartments were cleaned with 70% ethanol to eliminate the olfactory cues.
The percentage of mCherry + TH + cells in mCherry + cells (WT mice without 6-OHDA) was quantified one month after AAV injection. To avoid the possibility that the signal of converted TH + neurons may be masked by intense TH signals of dopamine neurites in the intact striatum, we carefully evaluate the TH signal of mCherry + cells via layer by layer scanning (every layer is 1 μm). The co-transduction efficiency of two AAVs (n = 5 mice) was quantified in the striatum (without 6-OHDA lesion) one week after injecting AAV-GFAP-mCherry and AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 . And the absolute number of AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 (n = 3 mice) was quantified (without 6-OHDA lesion) one month after injecting AAV-GFAP-mCherry and AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 . The percentage of mCherry + GFAP + cells in GFAP + cells was quantified in the striatum (without 6-OHDA lesion) one month after injecting AAV-GFAP-mCherry and AAV-GFAP-CasRx (n = 3 mice). The absolute number of TH + and DAT + cells were quantified in the striatum (with 6-OHDA lesion) one and three months after injecting AAV-GFAP-mCherry and AAV-GFAP-CasRx- Ptbp1 . Number of mice used in each experiment were indicated in figures and figure legends. All values are presented as mean ± SEM. Unpaired two - tailed Student’s t test was used to determine the statistical significance (p < 0.05), except Figures 6 Q and S7 O (paired two - tailed Student’s t test), and Figure 7 (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test) and Figures S7 P and S7Q (two-way ANOVA followed by bonferroni’s test). Randomization was used in all experiments and no statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.
