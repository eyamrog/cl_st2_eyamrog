Title: Open-state structure and pore gating mechanism of the cardiac sodium channel


Abstract: Summary

The heartbeat is initiated by voltage-gated sodium channel Na V 1.5, which opens rapidly and triggers the cardiac action potential; however, the structural basis for pore opening remains unknown. Here, we blocked fast inactivation with a mutation and captured the elusive open-state structure. The fast inactivation gate moves away from its receptor, allowing asymmetric opening of pore-lining S6 segments, which bend and rotate at their intracellular ends to dilate the activation gate to ∼10 Å diameter. Molecular dynamics analyses predict physiological rates of Na + conductance. The open-state pore blocker propafenone binds in a high-affinity pose, and drug-access pathways are revealed through the open activation gate and fenestrations. Comparison with mutagenesis results provides a structural map of arrhythmia mutations that target the activation and fast inactivation gates. These results give atomic-level insights into molecular events that underlie generation of the action potential, open-state drug block, and fast inactivation of cardiac sodium channels, which initiate the heartbeat.

Section: Introduction

The voltage-gated sodium (Na V ) channel Na V 1.5 (encoded by SCN5A ) activates in less than 1 ms to trigger the cardiac action potential and inactivates within 2–3 ms to allow repolarization and return to the resting state in preparation for firing the next action potential (reviewed in Catterall and Maier, 2015 10. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Maier, S.K.G. Voltage-gated sodium channels and the electrical excitability of the heart Saunders/Elsevier, Zipes, D.J. ∙ Jalife, J.

Physiol. 1984; 353 :1-50 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). How these physiologically essential conformational transitions open and close the pore at this rapid rate remains unknown. Mutations of Na V 1.5 cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias ( Clancy and Kass, 2005 14. Clancy, C.E. ∙ Kass, R.S. Inherited and acquired vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias: cardiac Na + and K + channels Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 :33-47 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Class I sodium channel-blocking antiarrhythmic drugs block Na V 1.5 by binding to a receptor site in the pore ( Catterall et al., 2020 11. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M.

By solving the structure of Na V 1.5 in the open state and comparing that structure with those of the resting and inactivated states, we reveal the mechanisms of rapid opening and fast inactivation of the pore at atomic resolution and show how these processes are modified by antiarrhythmic drugs and arrhythmia mutations.
Eukaryotic Na V s are composed of a large pore-forming α subunit and smaller auxiliary β subunits ( Ahern et al., 2016 2. Ahern, C.A. ∙ Payandeh, J. ∙ Bosmans, F. ...

From ionic currents to molecular mechanisms: the structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels Neuron. 2000; 26 :13-25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1811) PubMed Google Scholar ). The α subunit contains 24 transmembrane segments organized in four homologous domains ( D I– D IV). The first four segments of each domain (S1–S4) comprise the voltage sensors (VSs), and the S5 and S6 segments and the pore loop between them (S5-P-S6) form the pore module (PM). The intracellular ends of the pore-lining S6 segments serve as the activation gate, which rapidly opens the pore, and the intracellular loop connecting D III and D IV (L III-IV ) forms the fast inactivation gate, which closes the pore ( Catterall, 2000 9.

Mutation of a triple-hydrophobic motif in L III-IV , Ile-Phe-Met (IFM), completely eliminates fast inactivation ( Goldin, 2003 21. Goldin, A.L. Mechanisms of sodium channel inactivation Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13 :284-290 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ; West et al., 1992 70. West, J.W. ∙ Patton, D.E. ∙ Scheuer, T. ...

Structures of Na V s from prokaryotes, nerve, skeletal muscle, and heart reveal a conserved transmembrane core ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ...

However, in all mammalian Na V structures, the pore is closed by the activation gate at the intracellular ends of the S6 segments and inactivated by binding of the fast inactivation gate. Capturing the open state is challenging, because it remains open for only 1–2 ms before the fast inactivation gate closes and blocks it. Therefore, the structure of the open state and the mechanism of pore opening of the mammalian Na V channels remain unknown. Here, we introduced the mutation IFM/QQQ into the fast inactivation gate to block fast inactivation, successfully captured the structure of the resulting open state at high resolution by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), and revealed the structural mechanisms for rapid opening, fast inactivation, and open-state block in atomic detail.

Section: Results and discussion

The inward sodium current conducted by Na V 1.5 activates and inactivates within 2–3 ms ( Figure 1 A; drawn downward by convention). In contrast, Na V 1.5/QQQ opens but does not inactivate ( Figure 1 B), even though its voltage dependence of activation is unchanged ( Figure 1 C). High expression of Na V 1.5/QQQ is cytotoxic due to continuous leak of Na + . However, Na V 1.5/QQQ can be blocked by the class IC antiarrhythmic drug propafenone ( Kohlhardt and Fichtner, 1988 38. Kohlhardt, M. ∙ Fichtner, H. Block of single cardiac Na + channels by antiarrhythmic drugs: the effect of amiodarone, propafenone and diprafenone J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 102 :105-119 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), which enters the open pore and blocks the inward Na + current during single depolarizations ( Figure 1 D, top). Importantly, propafenone does not block Na V 1.5 in the resting state at the holding potential; however, as the inward sodium current approaches its maximum, propafenone enters the pore and blocks the open state ( Figure 1 D, red). As expected for open-state block ( Kohlhardt and Fichtner, 1988 38. Kohlhardt, M. ∙ Fichtner, H. Block of single cardiac Na + channels by antiarrhythmic drugs: the effect of amiodarone, propafenone and diprafenone J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 102 :105-119 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), repetitive stimulation increased drug inhibition, which was also more prominent at higher drug concentrations ( Figure 1 D, bottom; Figure 1 E). Use-dependent block during rapid stimulation was more potent than block at a low rate of stimulation or block with no prior stimulation ( Figure 1 F).
Guided by these observations, we expressed Na V 1.5/QQQ trapped in the open state at a high level in the presence of propafenone in order to stabilize the open-state structure and prevent pathogenic leak of Na + into the transfected cells ( STAR Methods ). The mutant channel was solubilized, purified, and analyzed at high resolution by cryo-EM ( STAR Methods ; Figures S1, S2, and S3 ; Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). The four domains of Na V 1.5/QQQ are organized in a domain-swapped manner, and the overall core structure has a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Å over 1,127 C-α residues compared to Na V 1.5 ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S4 ; Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). The selectivity filter, the four VSs, and the pore-lining S6 segments are well fit by the cryo-EM density and are very similar to Na V 1.5 ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S4 ). In contrast, there are major conformational changes in the activation gate, the fast inactivation gate, and its receptor, highlighting the critical role of these highly localized structural transitions in rapid opening and closing of the pore.
Voltage-gated sodium channels are purified in the inactivated state, which is the most stable state at 0 mV. In previous structures of mammalian Na V channels, the fast inactivation gate has been closed and the IFM motif has been inserted into its receptor in a hydrophobic pocket between the intracellular end of the S6 segment and the S4-S5 linker in D IV, as illustrated for wild-type Na V 1.5c in Figures 2 C and 2D. This position of the fast inactivation gate holds the pore closed; therefore, the fast inactivation gate must be released before the pore can open. In our native Na V 1.5c structures, the complete length of the intracellular linker connecting D III and D IV is clearly resolved and has robust cryo-EM density ( Figures 2 C and 2D, right), including the IFM motif of the fast inactivation gate ( Figure 2 D, right, circle). In contrast, there are striking changes in the conformations of the fast inactivation gate and its receptor in Na V 1.5/QQQ ( Figures 2 A, 2C, and 2D). We did not observe any cryo-EM density for the QQQ region of the fast inactivation gate (Leu1482-Met1489) ( Figures 2 A and 2C; dotted lines). Close inspection reveals that the cryo-EM density representing the linker connecting D III and D IV is narrow and discontinuous compared to native Na V 1.5c ( Figure 2 D), and the hydrophobic pocket that binds the IFM motif is empty in Na V 1.5/QQQ ( Figures 2 C and 2D, circles). Evidently, loss of IFM binding to the hydrophobic pocket in the inactivation gate receptor destabilizes the interaction between the D III- D IV loop and the D IV S4-S5 linker helix, and the increased mobility of the D III- D IV linker releases the fast inactivation gate to adopt a flexible conformation that renders it invisible in cryo-EM. It is remarkable that the dramatic functional effect of the IFM/QQQ mutation in completely blocking fast inactivation ( Figures 1 A and 1B) results from these local conformational changes in the fast inactivation gate, the IFM motif, and its receptor without inducing major conformational change in the transmembrane core. These results focus attention on this small region of Na V 1.5 as the primary mediator of pore gating and fast inactivation. These local conformational changes may have evolved to provide rapid and precise opening and closing of the activation gate, which takes place in less than 100 μs under physiological conditions ( Benndorf, 1994 4. Benndorf, K. Properties of single cardiac Na channels at 35 degrees C J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104 :801-820 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Even though there was little overall change in the structure of Na V 1.5/QQQ, we observed marked helical shifts in the S6 segments that form the intracellular activation gate ( Figures 3 A and 3B). The S6 segments move outward from the pore axis to enlarge the orifice of the activation gate. The bends of the four S6 segments start at the middle of each helix and are maximal at the intracellular ends ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Ser1460 and Ser1761 serve as the starting points for bending of D III S6 and D IV S6, respectively ( Figure 3 B). Strikingly, the movements of the S6 segments in D III (2.3 Å) and D IV (6.1 Å) are much larger than the movements of the S6 segments in D I or D II ( Figures 3 A and 3B). D IV-S6 shifts directly toward the IFM receptor and compresses its binding pocket by >2 Å ( Figures 3 C and 3D). This movement expels the IFM motif from its receptor and releases the fast inactivation gate. Previous mammalian Na V structures in inactivated states indicated that the IFM motif in the fast inactivation gate folds into the PM, as proposed in the “hinged-lid” model of fast inactivation ( Catterall, 2000 9. Catterall, W.A. From ionic currents to molecular mechanisms: the structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels Neuron. 2000; 26 :13-25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1811) PubMed Google Scholar ), and prevents opening of the activation gate through local allosteric interactions ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pan et al., 2018 53. Pan, X. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Zhou, Q. ...

Shen, H. ∙ Liu, D. ∙ Wu, K. ... Structures of human Na v 1.7 channel in complex with auxiliary subunits and animal toxins Science. 2019; 363 :1303-1308 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our Na V 1.5/QQQ structure, binding of the hydrophilic QQQ motif to the hydrophobic pocket in the inactivation gate receptor is unfavorable, leaving this motif mobile in the cytosol and invisible to cryo-EM. Consequently, D IV-S6 moves away from the pore axis, occupies the space that previously accommodated the IFM motif, and allows opening of the activation gate.
The movements of D III S6 and D IV S6 that open the pore are illustrated in three dimensions in Figures 3 C–3E. D III S6 of Na V 1.5/QQQ moves modestly away from the pore axis, whereas D IV S6 moves substantially further away ( Figures 3 C and 3D, red). The 6.1-Å movement of D IV S6 creates a clash with the bound IFM motif of the inactivation gate and pushes it out of its receptor site ( Figures 3 C and 3D, red). These movements open the orifice of the pore to an average diameter of ∼10 Å, as measured at the centers of the distal carbon atoms of the surrounding amino acid side chains ( Figure 3 E). The side chains of the amino acids in the four S6 segments of Na V 1.5 that close the pore are asymmetric, with a short Ala side chain in D I compared to Ile and Leu residues in the other three domains ( Figure 3 E). This structure results in an asymmetric orifice of the activation gate, with the distances of 10.6 Å between D II and D IV and 9.7 Å between D I and D III ( Figure 3 E).
The series of state-dependent conformational changes that are implied by our structures are illustrated in Figures 4 A–4C. In our model of the resting state ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wisedchaisri et al., 2019 71. Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ McCord, E. ... Resting-state structure and gating mechanism of a voltage-gated sodium channel Cell. 2019; 178 :993-1003.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), the side chains of hydrophobic residues in the S6 segments nearly completely close the orifice of the activation gate ( Figure 4 A). Strikingly, in the open state described here, bending and twisting motions of the S6 segments move those side chains out of the ion conductance pathway and open the pore ( Figure 4 B). For example, the side chain of V413 is twisted out of the lumen of the pore and is replaced in the pore lining by A414, the side chain of I1471 is moved out of the lumen and is partially replaced by I1472, and the side chains of both L941 and I1773 are pulled away from the pore axis in the open state ( Figures 4 A and 4B). In contrast, in the fast-inactivated states characterized previously ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pan et al., 2018 53. Pan, X. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structure of the human voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.4 in complex with β1 Science. 2018; 362 :eaau2486 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shen et al., 2019 62. Shen, H. ∙ Liu, D. ∙ Wu, K. ... Structures of human Na v 1.7 channel in complex with auxiliary subunits and animal toxins Science. 2019; 363 :1303-1308 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ), the IFM motif of the inactivation gate is bound in its receptor, the orifice of the intracellular activation gate is narrowed by movements of the S6 segments, most notably D III S6 and D IV S6, and the activation gate is functionally closed ( Figure 4 C). The open-state structure of Na V Ab, an ancestral homotetrameric Na V channel, has a four-fold symmetric orifice of ∼10 Å ( Lenaeus et al., 2017 41. Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ∙ Ing, C. ... Structures of closed and open states of a voltage-gated sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E3051-E3060 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). The four S6 segments of Na V 1.5/QQQ open to a similar average diameter ( Figure 3 E), suggesting that Na V 1.5/QQQ was successfully captured in its open state.
Sodium channels conduct Na + as a hydrated cation ( Hille, 2001 24. Hille, B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA, 2001 Google Scholar ). To further illustrate the potential functional properties of this open-state structure, we constructed van der Waals space-filling models to compare the size of the orifice of the activation gate in resting, open, and inactivated states to the size of hydrated Na + , whose diameter is 7.2 Å. Hydrated Na + fits through the orifice in the open state with little room to spare ( Figure 4 E; see legend for van der Waals measurements). In contrast, the orifice of the activation gate is too small to accommodate hydrated Na + in the resting or inactivated states ( Figures 4 D and 4F). To support this point further, we cut sections through the center of Na V 1.5 in the inactivated and open states and illustrated the side views of the van der Waals surfaces ( Figures 5 A, 5B, 5D, and 5E). In the open state, the pathway from the central cavity to the cytosol through the activation gate is wide enough to accommodate hydrated Na + . In contrast, the orifice of the activation gate is too small to accommodate hydrated Na + in the inactivated state. Together, the bottom and side views presented in Figures 4 D–4F and 5 A, 5B, 5D, and 5E show that the relatively small movements of the activation gate revealed by our structures as the sodium channel transitions from closed to open to inactivated states are sufficient to provide an all-or-none functional switch controlling the conductance of the open and closed pore. These small conformational movements are consistent with the rapid gating of Na V 1.5, in which pore opening and closing takes place in <100 μs under physiological conditions ( Benndorf, 1994 4. Benndorf, K. Properties of single cardiac Na channels at 35 degrees C J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104 :801-820 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) in order to precisely trigger and rapidly conduct the cardiac action potential.
To further test the hypothesis that our Na V 1.5/QQQ structure represents a functionally open state, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Na V 1.5 ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), Na V 1.5/LqhIII ( Jiang et al., 2021 29. Jiang, D. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ... Structural basis for voltage-sensor trapping of the cardiac sodium channel by a deathstalker scorpion toxin Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :128 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Na V 1.5/QQQ in the presence of harmonic restraints to stabilize the open-state structure ( Figures 6 and S5 ; STAR Methods ). Water and cations rapidly occupied the selectivity filter and central cavity of the pore in all three Na V 1.5 structures. Hydration of the activation gate ( Nwater ) was ∼5 for Na V 1.5 and ∼4 for Na V 1.5/LqhIII ( Figure 6 A; z = −2 nm). In contrast, Nwater in Na V 1.5/QQQ increased and became bimodal, with two states of comparable populations: a partially dehydrated state with Nwater ∼8 and a hydrated state with Nwater ∼18 ( Figure 6 A; z = −2 nm; Figures 6 B and 6C; Tables S2 and S3 ), similar to the open state of Na V Ab/1–226, where Nwater = 15.1 ± 0.8 ( Lenaeus et al., 2017 41. Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ∙ Ing, C. ... Structures of closed and open states of a voltage-gated sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E3051-E3060 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, seven spontaneous Na + translocation events across the open activation gate occurred in 5 μs of simulation (median, 10,000 bootstraps with replacement, sample size = 50 replicas of 100 ns, interquartile range [IQR] = 5–9; Figures 6 D and S6 ). In contrast, identical simulations for 6.6 μs with native Na V 1.5c and for 5 μs with Na V 1.5c/LqhIII did not reveal any Na + permeation events. Because only approximately one-half of individual channels are hydrated and conductive simultaneously ( Figure 6 C; Tables S2 and S3 ), the frequency of ion transit per open channel is ∼2.8 per μs (IQR = 2.0–3.6). The single-channel conductance of sodium channels is ∼10–20 picosiemens (pS) (e.g., Weiss and Horn, 1986 69. Weiss, R.E. ∙ Horn, R. Functional differences between two classes of sodium channels in developing rat skeletal muscle Science. 1986; 233 :361-364 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), commensurate with single ion transit rates of ∼4–8 per μs. Thus, these results further validate the structure of the open, functionally conductive activation gate at atomic resolution.
The open state of Na V 1.5 is inherently unstable, with a half-life of <50 μs under physiological conditions ( Benndorf, 1994 4. Benndorf, K. Properties of single cardiac Na channels at 35 degrees C J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104 :801-820 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unrestrained MD simulations revealed pore contraction, resulting in asymmetric conformations with d 2 < d 1 ( Figure S5 , top). The activation gate of unrestrained Na V 1.5/QQQ was slightly more hydrated, but Na + never passed through it ( Figures 6 and S6 ). This instability of the open state in our MD model may be correlated with the short half-life of the open state of the pore under physiological conditions ( Benndorf, 1994 4. Benndorf, K. Properties of single cardiac Na channels at 35 degrees C J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104 :801-820 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the mechanism of hydrophobic gating found in many ion channels ( Aryal et al., 2015 3. Aryal, P. ∙ Sansom, M.S. ∙ Tucker, S.J. Hydrophobic gating in ion channels J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427 :121-130 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ; Neale et al., 2015 49. Neale, C. ∙ Chakrabarti, N. ∙ Pomorski, P. ... Hydrophobic gating of ion permeation in magnesium channel CorA PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004303 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), a small increase in the diameter of the activation gate of Na V 1.5/QQQ was sufficient to drive the wetted-dewetted equilibrium toward the hydrated state of the gate and permit Na + translocation ( Figure 6 C; Table S2 ).
The class 1C antiarrhythmic drug propafenone blocks open Na V 1.5 channels with high affinity ( Kohlhardt and Fichtner, 1988 38. Kohlhardt, M. ∙ Fichtner, H. Block of single cardiac Na + channels by antiarrhythmic drugs: the effect of amiodarone, propafenone and diprafenone J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 102 :105-119 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clinical use of propafenone relies on state-dependent binding to open and/or inactivated Na V 1.5 channels, which targets its inhibitory effects to depolarized, rapidly firing cardiac myocytes that drive life-threatening arrhythmias ( Catterall et al., 2020 11. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. Structure and pharmacology of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2020; 60 :133-154 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this mechanism, propafenone blocked Na V 1.5/QQQ during single long test pulses, and its block accumulated in trains of pulses in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figures 1 D–1F). Propafenone did not have any effect on the sodium current at the holding potential, indicating that it cannot block the Na V 1.5 channel in the resting state, even when inactivation is prevented by the IFM/QQQ mutation ( Figure 1 D). Only after the pore opens and the inward sodium current approaches its peak can propafenone enter the pore through the open activation gate (as modeled in Figures 5 C and 5F) and block Na + conductance, eventually reducing it to ∼50% of maximum at steady state with 10 μM drug. Propafenone binds to the antiarrhythmic drug receptor site in the open pore of Na V 1.5/QQQ, physically blocking the exit of ions from the ion selectivity filter into the central cavity ( Figures 7 A and 7B) but leaving the intracellular activation gate open for entry of drug from the cytosol ( Figure 7 C). The open state of the activation gate is wide enough to accommodate an entering propafenone molecule, whereas the inactivated state is too narrow, as modeled in Figures 5 C and 5F. The binding position of propafenone is consistent with high-affinity drug block, because its two aromatic rings reach toward the walls of the central cavity to interact with F1762 and Y1769 ( Figures 7 D–7F), which form high-affinity interactions with bound antiarrhythmic drugs ( Pless et al., 2011 57. Pless, S.A. ∙ Galpin, J.D. ∙ Frankel, A. ... Molecular basis for class Ib anti-arrhythmic inhibition of cardiac sodium channels Nat. Commun. 2011; 2 :351 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ragsdale et al., 1994 58. Ragsdale, D.S. ∙ McPhee, J.C. ∙ Scheuer, T. ... Molecular determinants of state-dependent block of Na+ channels by local anesthetics Science. 1994; 265 :1724-1728 Crossref Scopus (750) PubMed Google Scholar ). Drug binding is stabilized by a π-π stacking interaction with this state-dependent binding pose of propafenone (4.7 Å; Figures 7 E and 7F) and by on-edge van der Waals interactions with Y1769 ( Figure 7 E). Bound propafenone also interacts with Q372 in the pore helix in D I, which has not previously been implicated in drug binding ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Its positively charged amino group is located in an ideal blocking position at the negatively charged exit from the ion selectivity filter, which would prevent the exit of cations into the central cavity ( Figures 7 C–7F). This high-resolution structural information may provide a useful guide to discovery of next-generation antiarrhythmic drugs that are safer and more effective.
The structures of voltage-gated sodium channels revealed fenestrations leading from the lipid bilayer into the central cavity ( Catterall et al., 2020 11.

Catterall, W.A. ∙ Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. Structure and pharmacology of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2020; 60 :133-154 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ), as suggested from studies of state-dependent drug block of sodium channels in the modulated receptor hypothesis ( Hille, 1977 23. Hille, B. Local anesthetics: hydrophilic and hydrophobic pathways for the drug-receptor reaction J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69 :497-515 Crossref Scopus (1433) PubMed Google Scholar ). MD studies support drug access, binding, and block via this route ( Boiteux et al., 2014a 6. Boiteux, C. ∙ Vorobyov, I. ∙ Allen, T.W. Ion conduction and conformational flexibility of a bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :3454-3459 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar , 2014b 7. Boiteux, C. ∙ Vorobyov, I. ∙ French, R.J. ... Local anesthetic and antiepileptic drug access and binding to a bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Structural basis for antiarrhythmic drug interactions with the human cardiac sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :2945-2954 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). In structure-function studies, we found that reducing the size of fenestrations of Na V Ab by mutation of a capping residue reduced resting-state drug block, whereas increasing the size of the fenestrations increased resting-state block ( Gamal El-Din et al., 2018 20. Gamal El-Din, T.M. ∙ Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Zheng, N. ... Fenestrations control resting-state block of a voltage-gated sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :13111-13116 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the changes in resting-state block caused by mutations were correlated with the size of the drug molecule ( Gamal El-Din et al., 2018 20. Gamal El-Din, T.M. ∙ Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Zheng, N. ... Fenestrations control resting-state block of a voltage-gated sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :13111-13116 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, propafenone may reach the high-affinity binding pose revealed here ( Figure 7 ) by passing through the fenestrations revealed in Na V 1.5 ( Catterall et al., 2020 11. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. Structure and pharmacology of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2020; 60 :133-154 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the resting state or by entering through the open activation gate in the open state as shown here ( Figures 7 C and 7F; Catterall et al., 2020 11. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. Structure and pharmacology of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2020; 60 :133-154 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structures suggest that drug access through the fenestrations is domain-dependent because the size and conformation of the fenestrations differ at the four domain interfaces ( Figure 7 G). Evidently, the extent of use-dependent block is controlled by the ratio of drug entry via two distinct molecular pathways, the open activation gate and the fenestrations, whose transitions are both domain dependent and state dependent.
Fast inactivation of sodium channels has been extensively studied by site-directed mutagenesis ( Catterall, 2000 9. Catterall, W.A. From ionic currents to molecular mechanisms: the structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels Neuron. 2000; 26 :13-25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1811) PubMed Google Scholar ; Goldin, 2003 21. Goldin, A.L. Mechanisms of sodium channel inactivation Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13 :284-290 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Site-directed antibodies ( Vassilev et al., 1988 66. Vassilev, P.M. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Identification of an intracellular peptide segment involved in sodium channel inactivation Science. 1988; 241 :1658-1661 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar , 1989 67. Vassilev, P. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Inhibition of inactivation of single sodium channels by a site-directed antibody Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :8147-8151 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) and site-directed cleavage of the sodium channel α subunit between homologous domains ( Stühmer et al., 1989 64. Stühmer, W. ∙ Conti, F. ∙ Suzuki, H. ... Structural parts involved in activation and inactivation of the sodium channel Nature. 1989; 339 :597-603 Crossref Scopus (1014) PubMed Google Scholar ) identified the short intracellular loop between D III and D IV as the lead candidate for the classically defined fast inactivation gate. Consistent with this idea, depolarization to close and hide the fast inactivation gate prevented site-directed antibody modification of the inactivation process ( Vassilev et al., 1988 66. Vassilev, P.M. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Identification of an intracellular peptide segment involved in sodium channel inactivation Science. 1988; 241 :1658-1661 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar , 1989 67.

USA. 1989; 86 :8147-8151 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). More detailed mutagenesis studies revealed the IFM motif, which serves as the hydrophobic latch of the inactivation gate, and led to proposal of a hinged-lid mechanism of fast inactivation in which those residues fold into the intracellular mouth of the PM and bind there ( Kellenberger et al., 1996 34. Kellenberger, S. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Movement of the Na + channel inactivation gate during inactivation J. Biol.

A cluster of hydrophobic amino acid residues required for fast Na( + )-channel inactivation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89 :10910-10914 Crossref Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peptides containing the IFM motif were shown to reconstitute fast inactivation in mutant sodium channels ( Eaholtz et al., 1994 16. Eaholtz, G. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Restoration of inactivation and block of open sodium channels by an inactivation gate peptide Neuron. 1994; 12 :1041-1048 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ), and measurements of accessibility of the IFM motif using the substituted cysteine accessibility method ( Karlin and Akabas, 1998 33. Karlin, A. ∙ Akabas, M.H. Substituted-cysteine accessibility method Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293 :123-145 Crossref Scopus (549) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that this amino acid sequence is buried during the fast inactivation process ( Kellenberger et al., 1996 34. Kellenberger, S. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Movement of the Na + channel inactivation gate during inactivation J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :30971-30979 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). A pair of Gly residues serves as a hinge to enable folding of the inactivation gate into its receptor, as assessed from single channel recordings of open-channel lifetimes ( Kellenberger et al., 1997a 35. Kellenberger, S. ∙ West, J.W. ∙ Catterall, W.A. ... Molecular analysis of potential hinge residues in the inactivation gate of brain type IIA Na + channels J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109 :607-617 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the interacting residues that form the functional inactivation gate receptor were extensively mapped to the S4-S5 linkers in domains III and IV and the intracellular end of the S6 segment in D IV ( Lerche et al., 1997 42. Lerche, H. ∙ Peter, W. ∙ Fleischhauer, R. ... Role in fast inactivation of the IV/S4-S5 loop of the human muscle Na + channel probed by cysteine mutagenesis J.

Interaction between the sodium channel inactivation linker and domain III S4-S5 Biophys. J. 1997; 73 :1885-1895 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). The movements of the fast inactivation gate implied by these structure-function studies are consistent with the hinged-lid mechanism of fast inactivation ( Kellenberger et al., 1996 34. Kellenberger, S. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Movement of the Na + channel inactivation gate during inactivation J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :30971-30979 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kellenberger et al., 1997a 35. Kellenberger, S. ∙ West, J.W. ∙ Catterall, W.A. ...

A cluster of hydrophobic amino acid residues required for fast Na( + )-channel inactivation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89 :10910-10914 Crossref Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the fast inactivation gate in solution revealed the structure of the IFM motif and an adjacent alpha helix in the unbound “not-inactivated” conformation, providing a potential structural model for the open fast inactivation gate ( Rohl et al., 1999 60. Rohl, C.A. ∙ Boeckman, F.A. ∙ Baker, C. ... Solution structure of the sodium channel inactivation gate Biochemistry. 1999; 38 :855-861 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results show clearly how the fast inactivation gate prevents pore opening when it is in its closed position and why recovery from fast inactivation is required for pore opening.
Our current results reveal the structural basis for the allosteric coupling of release of the fast inactivation gate and voltage-dependent pore opening in three dimensions. Release of the IFM motif from its receptor unlocks the bending and twisting movements of the S6 segments in D III and D IV that are required for pore opening. Although all four S6 segments move away from the pore axis in the activation process, the movements of the S6 segments in D III and D IV are largest and likely to be the rate-limiting steps for the activation process. Consistent with this idea, measurements of outward gating charge movements by voltage clamp fluorometry reveal that the S4 segments in D I and D II move first during the activation process, and the S4 segments in D III and D IV move more slowly and couple activation to fast inactivation ( Capes et al., 2013 8. Capes, D.L. ∙ Goldschen-Ohm, M.P. ∙ Arcisio-Miranda, M. ... Domain IV voltage-sensor movement is both sufficient and rate limiting for fast inactivation in sodium channels J. Gen. Physiol. 2013; 142 :101-112 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chanda and Bezanilla, 2002 12. Chanda, B. ∙ Bezanilla, F. Tracking voltage-dependent conformational changes in skeletal muscle sodium channel during activation J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). This conformational coupling is blocked by α-scorpion toxins, which bind to a receptor site on the S3-S4 linker in D IV ( Clairfeuille et al., 2019 13. Clairfeuille, T. ∙ Cloake, A. ∙ Infield, D.T. ...

Commun. 2021; 12 :128 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rogers et al., 1996 59. Rogers, J.C. ∙ Qu, Y. ∙ Tanada, T.N. ...

Chem. 1996; 271 :15950-15962 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ). As we have shown here, the movements of the S4 segments in the VSs are coupled to pore opening through conformational changes of the S4-S5 linkers in each domain, which serve as a corral in the resting state to immobilize the S6 segments that form the activation gate and then trigger their movements away from the pore axis during activation and pore opening ( Figures 4 A–4C; Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wisedchaisri et al., 2019 71. Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ McCord, E. ... Resting-state structure and gating mechanism of a voltage-gated sodium channel Cell. 2019; 178 :993-1003.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). This intricate coupled series of local conformational changes ( Figures 4 A–4C) is the key control mechanism governing both pore opening and fast inactivation on the rapid timescale required for triggering and conducting the cardiac action potential.
Long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT-3) mutations impair fast inactivation and generate arrhythmic sodium currents ( Clancy and Kass, 2005 14. Clancy, C.E. ∙ Kass, R.S. Inherited and acquired vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias: cardiac Na + and K + channels Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 :33-47 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). They target the fast inactivation gate, the S4-S5 linkers in D III and D IV that form the inactivation gate receptor, and the intracellular ends of the S6 segments that form the activation gate ( Figures 4 G and 4H, green spheres). Affected amino acid residues include F1488, M1489, and T1490 in the canonical Ile-Phe-Met-Thr (IFMT) motif in the fast inactivation gate and its interacting partners in the inactivation gate receptor ( Figures 4 G and 4H; Catterall, 2000 9. Catterall, W.A. From ionic currents to molecular mechanisms: the structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels Neuron. 2000; 26 :13-25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1811) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, most of these affected amino acid residues move during pore opening and/or fast inactivation (compare Figures 4 A–4C with Figures 4 G and 4H). These mutations cause a gain of function by impairing the intrinsic fast inactivation process and producing persistent and repetitive sodium currents that generate arrhythmias. Our results place these life-threatening arrhythmia mutations in three-dimensional context in these crucial functional components of Na V 1.5.
Conductance through the pore of Na V channels is controlled by two key processes that are essential for action potential generation: rapid opening of the intracellular activation gate followed by rapid closure and inactivation of the pore by the fast inactivation gate. Our results define the mechanisms of these two crucial processes at the atomic level. Subtle bending and twisting motions of the S6 segments, particularly in domains III and IV, open the fast inactivation gate to an orifice of 10.6 Å × 9.7 Å, allowing rapid entry of Na + . Importantly, this bending and twisting motion of the S6 segments and opening of the pore occur before the binding of propafenone, which locks the activation gate and stabilizes the bona fide open state by its binding. In the open state, the fast inactivation gate and its IFM motif are initially in the cytosol, but this hinged lid immediately swings inward and binds rapidly to the PM to close the pore within 2–3 ms through local allosteric interactions. These results reveal at the atomic level how the pore opens rapidly, the fast inactivation gate binds almost immediately to close the pore and prevent its reopening, and the slower recovery from fast inactivation allows the next pore opening to generate a new action potential and sustain the rhythm of the heartbeat.
Although we have validated the functionality of the Na V 1.5 construct we used to determine the open-state structure, it is not an intact channel, and the protein was purified in the presence of a detergent and was not embedded in a phospholipid bilayer. While the resolution of the structure is high enough for us to resolve small conformational changes at the activation gate, an even higher resolution would help reveal more details of the structural changes, including rotamers of side chains and solvent bound to the protein. Finally, due to technical reasons, we used the open-state blocker propafenone to stabilize the open state of the channel, which could modify the subtle dynamic nature of the open state in the absence of the drug.

E. coli GC10 was cultured at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin for plasmid DNA extraction. E. coli DH10Bac was cultured at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin sulfate, 7 μg/mL gentamicin and 10 μg/mL tetracycline for bacmid production.
Sf9 ( Spodoptera frugiperda ) insect cells were maintained in Grace’s Insect Medium and supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin at 27°C and passaged at 90% confluence for baculovirus production. HEK293S GnTI - ( Homo sapiens ) mammalian cells were maintained and infected in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for electrophysiology.
Mammalian Na V s are large and structurally complicated transmembrane proteins, which are difficult to express in heterologous cells and purify to homogeneity. We previously overcame these difficulties by developing a fully functional core-construct of Na V 1.5 with truncations of unstructured regions of the intracellular loops and C-terminal domain (Na V 1.5 C ) ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). The IFM/QQQ mutation was introduced into this well-behaved protein construct. As expected from previous work ( West et al., 1992 70. West, J.W. ∙ Patton, D.E. ∙ Scheuer, T. ... A cluster of hydrophobic amino acid residues required for fast Na( + )-channel inactivation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89 :10910-10914 Crossref Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ), this mutation completely blocked fast inactivation with no effect on the voltage dependence of activation ( Figures 1 A–1C). However, because the mutation abolishes fast inactivation, HEK293S cells were killed by the constant leak of Na + current after two days of overexpression of Na V 1.5/QQQ. We optimized expression conditions by testing several Na V channel blockers, and we finally maintained the HEK293S cells long enough for effective protein expression in the presence of the Na V -blocking antiarrhythmic drug propafenone ( Figures 1 D–1F). The Na V 1.5/QQQ protein was solubilized in detergents and purified in a mono-disperse peak from size-exclusion chromatography ( Figure S1 A). Despite low yield, cryo-EM micrographs of the concentrated sample showed excellent quality, and the collected micrographs yielded sharp 2D averages with obvious Na V features ( Figure S1 B). A total of 287,306 particles were selected for calculating the final reconstruction map ( Figures S2 and S3 A), which fit the gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curve at the criterion value of 0.143 with a resolution of 3.3 Å ( Figure S3 B). A local resolution map revealed the core region of Na V 1.5/QQQ at 3.0-3.5 Å ( Figure S3 A), illustrating the high quality of the cryo-EM map. Cryo-EM density is well distributed in spherical space, and an FSC curve comparing our model to the original cryo-EM map has overall resolution of 3.4 Å ( Figures S3 C and S3D).
All experiments were performed at room temperature (21-24°C) as described previously ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human HEK293S GnTI - cells were maintained and infected on cell culture plates in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for electrophysiology. Unless otherwise mentioned, HEK293S GnTI - cells were held at −120 mV and 100-ms pulses were applied in 10 mV increments from −120 mV to +60 mV. A P/-4 holding leak potential was set to −120 mV. Extracellular solution contained in mM: 140 NaCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Intracellular solution contained: 35 NaCl, 105 CsF, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Glass electrodes had a resistance 1.5-3 MΩ. Currents resulting from applied pulses were filtered at 5 kHz with a low-pass Bessel filter, and then digitized at 20 kHz. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), voltage commands were generated using Pulse 8.5 software (HEKA, Germany), and ITC18 analog-to-digital interface (Instrutech, Port Washington, NY).
The IFM motif of rNa V 1.5 C was replaced by QQQ and the mutant gene was verified by DNA sequencing. Detailed expression and purification of rat Na V 1.5/QQQ was described in our previous study with modifications ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, Na V 1.5/QQQ was expressed in HEK293S GnTI − cells (ATCC) with 10 μM propafenone in the medium. The protein was extracted by 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) and 0.2% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate Tris salt (CHS, Anatrace) in Buffer A containing 25 mM HEPES pH = 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 100 μM propafenone. After centrifugation, supernatant was agitated with anti-Flag M2-agarose resin (Sigma). Flag resin was washed in Buffer A supplemented with 0.06% glycol-diosgenin (GDN, Anatrace). The concentrated elution was loaded to Superose-6 column pre-equilibrated with buffer B containing 25 mM HEPES pH = 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.06% GDN, and 100 μM propafenone. Peak fractions of the first SEC were pooled and concentrated to ∼0.5 ml, then was re-loaded to Superose-6 column pre-equilibrated with buffer C containing 25 mM imidazole pH = 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.006% GDN, and 100 μM propafenone. Finally, peak fractions were concentrated to 30 μL at 3.6 mg/ml.
Three microliters of purified sample were applied to glow-discharged holey gold grids (UltraAuFoil, 300 mesh, R1.2/1.3), and blotted for 2.0 - 3.5 s at 100% humidity and 4°C before being plunged frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen using a FEI Mark IV Vitrobot. All data were acquired using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV, a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter with a slit width of 20 eV. All movie stacks were automatically collected using Leginon ( Suloway et al., 2005 65. Suloway, C. ∙ Pulokas, J. ∙ Fellmann, D. ... Automated molecular microscopy: the new Leginon system J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151 :41-60 Crossref Scopus (1231) PubMed Google Scholar ) at a nominal magnification of130,000x with a pixel size of 0.528 Å (super-resolution mode). Defocus range was set between −1.0 and −2.4 μm. The dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, two separate datasets for Na V 1.5/QQQ were collected, 2,352 movie stacks were collected for dataset 1, each stack was exposed for 7.0 s with 35 frames with a total dose of 50 e - / Å 2 . 2,833 movie stacks for dataset 2, each stack was exposed for 8.4 s with 42 frames with a total dose of 60 e - / Å 2 .
All the movie stacks were motion-corrected with MotionCorr2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 74. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ), binned 2- fold, and dose-weighted, yielding a pixel size of 1.056 Å. Defocus values of each aligned sum were estimated with Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 73. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle picking, 2D classification, 3D classification and 3D auto-refine was performed in RELION3.0 ( Scheres, 2012 61. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ). A detailed data processing diagram is presented in Figure S2 . The two datasets of Na V 1.5/QQQ were processed separately, and the last seven frames of each stack of the second dataset were discarded to keep the same total dose of 50 e - / Å 2 as dataset 1. Then the polished particles including 204,375 particles from dataset 1 and 328,465 particles from dataset 2 were combined and subjected a final round of multi-reference 3D classification. The best class containing 287,306 particles were subsequently auto-refined and sharpened in Relion 3.0. Local resolution was estimated by ResMap in Relion 3.0.
The structures of rat Na V 1.5 C (PDB code: 6UZ0 ) were manually fitted into the cryo-EM density map of Na V 1.5/QQQ using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 56. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. The models were manually checked and corrected in COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 17. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequently refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model versus map FSC curves were calculated by Phenix.mtrage. Statistics for cryo-EM data collection and model refinement are summarized in Table S1 .
The cryo-EM structures of Na V 1.5 ( Jiang et al., 2020 28. Jiang, D. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Tonggu, L. ... Structure of the cardiac sodium channel Cell. 2020; 180 :122-134.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), Na V 1.5/LqhIII ( Jiang et al., 2021 29. Jiang, D. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ... Structural basis for voltage-sensor trapping of the cardiac sodium channel by a deathstalker scorpion toxin Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :128 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Na V 1.5/QQQ lacking D I- D II and D II- D III linkers are composed of three chains which correspond to D I, D II, and D III- D IV. The MODELER software (ver. 9.22) was used to insert missing residues (including the missing QQQ motif) and sidechains within the polypeptide chains, followed by quick refinement using MD with simulated annealing ( Fiser and Sali, 2003 19. Fiser, A. ∙ Sali, A. Modeller: generation and refinement of homology-based protein structure models Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374 :461-491 Crossref Scopus (1456) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Neutral N- and C-termini were used for the three polypeptide chains in our refined model of Na V 1.5. N-termini from chains D II and D III-IV were acetylated, and a neutral amino terminus (-NH 2 ) was used for D I. Neutral carboxyl groups (-COOH) were used for all C-termini. Disulfide bonds linking residues 327-342, 909-918, and 1730-1744 were included in our models of Na V 1.5 and Na V 1.5/LqhIII as they were present in the cryo-EM structure; however, no glycans were added to the protein. In the case of Na V 1.5/QQQ, an additional disulfide bond linking residues 281-336 was included and the 1730-1744 bond was excluded as indicated in the cryo-EM structure. For the Na V 1.5/LqhIII model, charged N- and C-termini were used for LqhIII and disulfide bonds linking residues 12-65, 16-37, 23-47, and 27-49 were included.
Molecular models of Na V 1.5 structures were prepared using the input generator, Membrane Builder ( Jo et al., 2007 30. Jo, S. ∙ Kim, T. ∙ Im, W.

CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder toward realistic biological membrane simulations J. Comput. Chem. 2014; 35 :1997-2004 Crossref Scopus (1593) PubMed Google Scholar ) from CHARMM-GUI ( Jo et al., 2009 31. Jo, S. ∙ Lim, J.B. ∙ Klauda, J.B. ... CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder for mixed bilayers and its application to yeast membranes Biophys. J. 2009; 97 :50-58 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1188) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each model, the channel was embedded in a hydrated DMPC bilayer, with approximately 150 mM NaCl. The protein was translated and rotated for membrane embedding using the PPM server ( Lomize et al., 2012 43. Lomize, M.A. ∙ Pogozheva, I.D. ∙ Joo, H. ... OPM database and PPM web server: resources for positioning of proteins in membranes Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :D370-D376 Crossref Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lipid bilayer was assembled using the replacement method and solvent ions were added at random positions using a distance-based algorithm. A periodic rectangular cell with approximate dimensions of 14x14x13 nm was used, which comprised ∼240,000 atoms.
The CHARMM36 all-atom force field was used in conjunction with the TIP3P water model ( Best et al., 2012 5. Best, R.B. ∙ Zhu, X. ∙ Shim, J. ...

All-atom empirical potential for molecular modeling and dynamics studies of proteins J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102 :3586-3616 Crossref Scopus (12349) PubMed Google Scholar ). Non-bonded fixes for backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms with Na + and lipid head groups with Na + were imposed ( Noskov and Roux, 2008 52. Noskov, S.Y. ∙ Roux, B.

B. 2013; 117 :10183-10192 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). For rNa V 1.5/QQQ, an additional non-bonded fix for guanidinium nitrogen with carboxylate oxygen was imposed ( Huang et al., 2017 26. Huang, J. ∙ Rauscher, S. ∙ Nawrocki, G. ... CHARMM36m: an improved force field for folded and intrinsically disordered proteins Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :71-73 Crossref Scopus (3480) PubMed Google Scholar ). Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald algorithm ( Darden et al., 1993 15. Darden, T. ∙ York, D. ∙ Pedersen, L. Particle mesh Ewald: An N-log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98 :10089-10092 Crossref Scopus (23943) Google Scholar ; Essmann et al., 1995 18. Essmann, U.P.L. ∙ Berkowitz, M.L. ∙ Darden, T. ... A smooth particle mesh Ewald method J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103 :8577-8593 Crossref Scopus (17846) Google Scholar ) and chemical bonds were constrained using the LINCS algorithm ( Hess, 2008 22. Hess, B. P-LINCS: A parallel linear constraint solver for molecular simulation J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2008; 4 :116-122 Crossref Scopus (2772) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The energy of the system was minimized with protein position restraints on the backbone (4000 kJ/mol/nm 2 ) and side chains (2000 kJ/mol/nm 2 ), as well as lipid position and dihedral restraints (1000 kJ/mol/nm 2 ) using 5000 steps of steepest descent. The simulation systems were then pre-equilibrated using multi-step isothermal-isovolumetric (NVT) and isothermal-isobaric (NPT) conditions while decreasing the restraints at each step (see Table S2a for parameters). “Production” simulations with and without harmonic restraints on backbone heavy atoms (500 kJ/mol/nm 2 ) were generated with a 2 fs time integration step. The equilibration time was decided based on RMSD analyses of Cα atoms ( Figure S9 ) and average hydration of the gate over time ( Figure S10 ). Details on production simulations equilibration time, and time used in analyses are indicated in Table S2 b. All simulations were carried out using GROMACS version 2019.3 ( http://www.gromacs.org ).
In each snapshot of our simulations, atomic positions were translated and rotated by aligning the Cα atoms from pore transmembrane helices (S5 and S6 from all domains) of Na V 1.5 to the initial structure produced by CHARMM-GUI. The positions of all atoms were then centered in the xy-plane by the center of mass (CoM) of pore transmembrane helices and the z axis by the CoM of Cα atoms from the DEKA motif in the SF. After performing the spatial transformations, the z axis of the simulation box was used as the pore axis of Na V 1.5 and the transformed positions were used for subsequent analyses.
The axial distribution of water was computed by counting the number of water O atoms within a cylindrical of radius 8.5 Å centered on the pore axis. The probability distribution of water was calculated for each replica by counting the number of water molecules in uniform cylindrical slices along the pore-axis and normalizing the counts by the slice with the highest number of water molecules (solvent slice). The average and SEM of the probability distribution was computed across replicas.
Pore hydration analysis indicated a dehydrated region located at the ICAG (−2.8 nm < z < −1.5 nm). The number of water molecules in the gate was counted for each frame and normalized by the total number of frames to obtain the probability distribution. The average and SEM were computed across replicas.
To measure the size of the intracellular activation gate, residues at the ends of the S6 helices were selected as described ( Jiang et al., 2021 29. Jiang, D. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ... Structural basis for voltage-sensor trapping of the cardiac sodium channel by a deathstalker scorpion toxin Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :128 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following residue number selections were used in rNa V 1.5: DI: 410-413, DII: 939-942, DIII: 1469-1472, and DIV: 1771-1774. The CoM of Cα-atoms from each selection was projected onto the xy-plane and the distances between opposing S6 tails were measured ( d 1 : DI-DIII and d 2 : DII-DIV).
Analyses were performed using MDTraj ( McGibbon et al., 2015 45. McGibbon, R.T. ∙ Beauchamp, K.A. ∙ Harrigan, M.P. ... MDTraj: A modern open library for the analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories Biophys. J. 2015; 109 :1528-1532 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1298) PubMed Google Scholar ) and molecular visualizations were rendered using Visual Molecular Dynamics ( Humphrey et al., 1996 27. Humphrey, W. ∙ Dalke, A. ∙ Schulten, K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 :33-38 27–38 Crossref Scopus (47141) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For electrophysiological results, the data are presented as mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was evaluated with Student’s t test and ANOVA. For the molecular dynamics simulations, maximum likelihood values and statistical significance were estimated by bootstrapping.
