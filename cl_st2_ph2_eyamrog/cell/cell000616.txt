Title: Bone marrow hematopoiesis drives multiple sclerosis progression


Abstract: Summary

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) rapidly sense immune activation, yet their potential interplay with autoreactive T cells in MS is unknown. Here, we report that bone marrow HSPCs are skewed toward myeloid lineage concomitant with the clonal expansion of T cells in MS patients. Lineage tracing in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS, reveals remarkable bone marrow myelopoiesis with an augmented output of neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes that invade the CNS. We found that myelin-reactive T cells preferentially migrate into the bone marrow compartment in a CXCR4-dependent manner. This aberrant bone marrow myelopoiesis involves the CCL5-CCR5 axis and augments CNS inflammation and demyelination. Our study suggests that targeting the bone marrow niche presents an avenue to treat MS and other autoimmune disorders.

Section: Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that afflicts approximately 2.8 million people worldwide. The majority of MS patients are under 40 years of age. CNS demyelinating lesions in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are characterized by massive CNS inflammatory infiltrates comprising an intricate coordination of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Among CNS-infiltrating immune cells, autoreactive T cells initiate CNS demyelinating lesions ( Bar-Or and Li, 2021 1. Bar-Or, A. ∙ Li, R.

Following entry into the CNS, autoreactive T cells induce a cascade of cytokines and chemokines that initiate local inflammation and recruit hematogenous myeloid cells, most notably neutrophils and monocytes ( Bar-Or and Li, 2021 1.

Distinct from lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes have a rapid turnover rate of a few days due to their short life-span, and thus exist as a limited population in blood ( Boettcher and Manz, 2017 2.

During the active phase of MS, the mobilization of myeloid cells from the marginal blood pool and other peripheral reserves leads to a surge of circulating myeloid cells associated with worsened disease activity ( Hasselbalch et al., 2018 10.

However, the mechanisms of the continuous supply of newly generated myeloid cells and their impact on autoimmune inflammatory CNS injury remain unknown.
As a central immune organ, bone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis that harbors hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to generate blood cells and to maintain immune homeostasis in the periphery and CNS ( Brioschi et al., 2021 3.

Among various immune cell types from terminally differentiated progeny of HSPCs, those of the myeloid lineage predominate. In MS and EAE, the surge of circulating neutrophils and monocytes suggests a dynamic production and supply from the bone marrow ( Hasselbalch et al., 2018 10.

Neutrophil-related factors as biomarkers in EAE and MS J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212 :23-35 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this regard, a number of key questions need to be resolved. First, since bone marrow is at the crossroads of blood and immunity, how does bone marrow respond to MS; that is, what are the dynamics and characteristics of bone marrow HSPC response in MS? Second, evidence suggests bone marrow as a preferential homing site for T cells ( Di Rosa and Pabst, 2005 6. Di Rosa, F. ∙ Pabst, R.

Third, because hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity is orchestrated by environmental factors to provide a balanced output of different leukocyte subtypes, is there a master switch that controls the activity of HSPCs in MS and EAE? Fourth, what is the fate of the newly produced myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocytes in MS? Lastly, what is the impact of newly generated myeloid cells on inflammatory CNS injury? This study seeks to address these questions.

Section: Results

Leukocyte entry into the CNS is a cardinal early event in MS. Massive infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS suggests their rapid consumption from limited peripheral reserves, which can stimulate the replenishment of new cells from hematopoietic organs such as bone marrow. To understand how HSPCs sense and adapt to disease development in MS, we characterized HSPCs and their downstream lineages in bone marrow samples obtained from treatment-naive MS patients with single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 1 A). After Louvain clustering of 108,983 cells, canonical markers were used to identify four major cell types (HSPCs, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, and erythroid/megakaryocytes) based on uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), which showed high integration quality reflected by cellular distribution on dimension reduction graphs. We identified an increase of HSPCs and myeloid lineage cells in patients with MS relative to healthy controls ( Figures 1 B, S1 A, and S1B). Thereafter, we grouped bone marrow cells into clusters and mapped cells based on force-directed graph from MS patients and controls ( Figures 1 C, S1 C, and S1D). We found that bone marrow hematopoiesis was substantially rewired toward myeloid lineages in patients with MS ( Figures 1 C and 1D), accompanied by a reduction of stemness score in bone- marrow HSCs, suggesting an increase of HSC differentiation toward downstream lineages ( Figure 1 E). Notably, we found an increase of gene modules (e.g., AZU1 , MPO , and S100A8 ) in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and (e.g., CST3 , IFITM3 , and CTSS ) in monocyte-dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs) among HSPCs of MS patients ( Figure 1 F), accompanied by an increase of transcription factors related to myeloid differentiation, including CEBPZ , RARA , and IRF8 ( Figures 1 G, S1 E, and S1F). These signatures imply an increased differentiation of HSCs to the myeloid lineage in MS.
To measure differentially expressed genes (DEGs), KEGG-pathway analysis was adopted and revealed the enrichment of hypoxia-inducibale factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling, chemokine signaling, IL-17 signaling, and Hippo signaling in HSCs from MS patients ( Figure S1 G), we also note an upregulation of DEGs, including AREG , PADI4, ARG1 , and MNDA here ( Figure S1 H). In GMPs from MS patients, we found enrichment of chemokine signaling, pyrimidine metabolism, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, and Ras-associated protein 1 (Rap1) signaling ( Figure S1 G) as well as the upregulation of the DEGs S100A9 , DEFA1 , and MMP9 ( Figure S1 H). In MDPs of MS patients, chemokine signaling and IL-17 signaling were enriched ( Figure S1 G) and DEGs including S100A9 , S100A12 , S100A8 , CSF3R and CD163 were upregulated ( Figure S1 H). In neutrophils of MS patients, upregulation of DEGs included BTG2, IL1B, CXCR2, FCGR3B , and S100A9 ( Figure S1 H). In monocytes from MS patients, we identified the upregulation of DEGs, including RBFOX2, APOO, S100A9, G0S2 , and CSF3R ( Figure S1 H).
To determine potential alterations of T cell clones in MS patients, we performed subclustering analyses from a total of 17,512 T cells ( Figure 1 H). In particular, single-cell TCR-sequencing analyses revealed clonal expansion of bone marrow T cells of MS patients ( Figures 1 I and 1J), together with an increase of highly expanded clones ( Figure 1 K). Quantification revealed an increase of the most highly expanded (maximum) T cell clones in MS patients versus controls ( Figure 1 L), suggesting clonal expansion of bone marrow T cells in MS patients. Bone marrow clonal CD4 + T cells in MS patients displayed increased expression of DEGs ( TRAV19 , CLORF162 , and CCL5 ) ( Figure 1 M), as well as the enrichment of RNA metabolism, Ras-homologous (RHO) GTPase signaling, TCR signaling, and Roundabout (ROBO) signaling ( Figure 1 N).
Additionally, flow cytometry analysis revealed increased counts of HSCs, myeloid-cell progenitors (common myeloid progenitors [CMPs] and GMPs), and downstream neutrophils and monocytes ( Figure S2 ). Together, these results provide a broad and unbiased view of the cellular and molecular features of bone marrow hematopoietic cells in MS.
To gain insight into the bone marrow characteristics displayed by MS patients, we adopted a murine model of MS, EAE, induced by MOG 35 – 55 immunization. We found a remarkable increase of long-term HSCs (Lin − Sca1 + c-Kit + CD150 + CD48 − ) in the femur bone marrow, along with increased 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in EAE mice ( Figures 2 A–2C). The increase of HSCs started at 6 days post-immunization (dpi) and persisted until the late disease phase ( Figures 2 B and 2C). In addition, we found downregulation of stemness genes ( Cdkn1 , Fgfr3 , Hoxb5 , Hoxb6 , Egr1 , and Aldh1 ) in HSCs at early (7 dpi), peak (14 dpi), and late (28 dpi) disease phases in these mice ( Figure S3 A). Of interest, we also detected an increase of HSCs within the cranium and vertebral bone marrow ( Figure S3 B). Using micro-positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scanning, we found increased uptake of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a glucose uptake tracer, within the femur and vertebral bone of EAE mice at 14 dpi ( Figure 2 D), reflecting an increase in bone marrow cell activity.
As EAE is a model of autoimmune response directed against specific components of myelin, we next examined whether an increase of HSC activity in EAE mice requires autoantigen specificity. In mice receiving incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA), complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), pertussis toxin (PT), IFA plus PT, or CFA plus PT without autoantigen, HSC activity remained similar to naive controls ( Figure 2 E), suggesting that exogenous autoantigen is required for the increase in bone marrow HSC activity. Indeed, immunization with MOG 35–55 led to a significant increase of HSCs ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, immunization with ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 had a less profound impact on HSC activity than MOG 35 55 ( Figure 2 E), suggesting that MOG 35 – 55 may have stronger effects on HSC activity. Using transgenic mouse lines harboring autoreactive CD4 + T cells that recognize OVA 323 – 339 or MOG 35 – 55 epitope (2D2), we found higher counts of bone marrow HSCs and their expression of Ki67 in 2D2 mice compared with OVA and controls ( Figure 2 F). In a passive EAE model, we also found increased HSC activity in the bone marrow of wild-type recipient mice after transfer of myelin-reactive T cells that were collected from spleen of wild-type EAE mice ( Figure S3 C). These results suggest that myelin-reactive T cells increase the activity of HSCs in bone marrow.
Next, we assessed bone marrow cellular lineage using flow cytometry. We found an increase in bone marrow CMPs, GMPs, and MDPs at 14 dpi, the peak phase of EAE ( Figures 3 A and 3B). In contrast, the count of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) was not significantly altered ( Figure 3 B). Moreover, the numbers of neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes were robustly increased in bone marrow of femurs and CNS-surrounding bones at 14 dpi in EAE mice with actively ( Figures 3 C, S4 A, and S4B) or passively transferred disease ( Figure S4 C). The numbers of lymphocytes such as B cells and CD8 + T cells were reduced in bone marrow of femur and CNS-surrounding bones from EAE mice ( Figures 3 C, S4 B, and S4C).
To track the fate of newly derived neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes within bone marrow, we leveraged lineage tracing of HSCs and their ontogeny in EAE mice. HSCs, downstream progenitors, and differentiated neutrophils/monocytes/lymphocytes were genetically labeled with tdTomato in a transgenic Fgd5-CreER/tdTomato mouse line. This approach allowed us to spatially and temporally map the fate of HSCs and downstream myeloid cells over the course of EAE ( Figure 4 A). Following EAE induction, increased signal of tdTomato + HSCs in the bone marrow of Fgd5-CreER/tdTomato mice at 7 and 14 dpi was seen ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Importantly, we note a corresponding increase of tdTomato + GMPs and MDPs, but not CLPs ( Figure 4 C), and an increase of tdTomato + neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes in the bone marrow was also determined ( Figures 4 D and 4E). These findings demonstrate the consequence of increased myelopoiesis, leading to augmented production of neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes in EAE.
To track the mobilization of these newly derived neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes, we measured the counts of tdTomato + cells in multiple organs. Flow cytometry analysis of cells from spleen, blood, brain, and spinal cord revealed that tdTomato + neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes were increased in spleen and blood, as well as in the brain and spinal cord ( Figures 4 F–4H). These results demonstrate that newly generated neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes can be mobilized from bone marrow and penetrate the CNS tissues, suggesting that these cells may contribute to neuroinflammation during EAE development.
The bone marrow niche harbors environmental factors that can attract T cells from circulation and lymphoid organs ( Di Rosa and Pabst, 2005 6. Di Rosa, F. ∙ Pabst, R.

High avidity myeloid leukemia-associated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells preferentially reside in the bone marrow Blood. 2009; 113 :2238-2244 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). As myelopoiesis is augmented in wild-type EAE mice, we asked whether autoreactive T cells can migrate into bone marrow and affect hematopoiesis. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that MOG 35 – 55 -specific CD4 + T cells predominantly accumulate in the bone marrow of EAE mice from the early to peak phases ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S5 A), this is accompanied by biased TCR Vβ usage in bone marrow CD4 + T cells ( Figure S5 B). To determine the phenotype of CD4 + T cells homing to bone marrow, we injected myelin-reactive CD4 + T cells obtained from donor ubiquitin-GFP (UBC-GFP) EAE mice into recipient Rag2 −/− mice (lacking T and B cells) ( Figure 5 C). We found that myelin-reactive T cells homing to bone marrow are mainly CD44 + CD62L − along with a portion of T cells expressing the activation marker CD69 ( Figure 5 D). These profiles resemble myelin-reactive T cells in different organs of donor EAE mice prior to transfer ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Additionally, we also found an increase of CD4 + T cells in the bone marrow of 2D2 mice without immunization ( Figure S5 E).
CXCL12 is a key factor derived from bone marrow stromal cells to bind its cognate receptor CXCR4 to drive lymphocyte chemotaxis. We therefore tested the potential role of CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in the migration of myelin-reactive T cells to bone marrow. To this end, we used small-interfering RNA (siRNA) to in vitro knockdown CXCR4 in CD4 + T cells isolated from spleen of UCB-GFP EAE mice, and then injected these myelin-reactive T cells into Rag2 −/− recipient mice ( Figure S5 F and S5G). We found that the homing of myelin-reactive CD4 + T cells to bone marrow following CXCR4 knockdown was impaired ( Figure 5 E), together with a blunted increase of bone marrow HSCs and downstream myeloid lineage cells ( Figures S5 H and S5I). In addition, homing of 2D2 T cells into bone marrow was more prominent than OVA-transgenic CD4 + T cells ( Figure S5 J). These results suggest a pivotal role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in the recruitment of myelin-reactive T cells into bone marrow in EAE.
To further examine the impact of myelin-reactive T cells on bone marrow myelopoiesis, we injected 2D2 T cells into Rag2 −/− recipient mice. Thereafter, we found that 2D2 T cells preferentially migrated to bone marrow in recipient mice ( Figures 5 F and 5G), accompanied with an increase of HSC activity, and downstream myeloid progenitors (GMP and MDP) and myeloid cells (neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes) activity ( Figures 5 H and 5I). These results suggest that myelin-reactive T cells contribute to the augmentation of bone marrow myelopoiesis.
The activity of HSCs and downstream progenitors are determined by environmental factors. To understand how autoreactive T cells induce bone marrow myelopoiesis, we quantified the factors derived from bone marrow-residing 2D2 T cells. Among 113 cytokines measured by a proteome profiler, we found that cytokine CCL5 (Rantes) is highly expressed by 2D2 CD4 + T cells ( Figures 6 A, S6 A, and S6B). Similarly, flow cytometry analysis also revealed upregulation of CCL5 in 2D2 T cells, versus wild-type controls, in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes ( Figure 6 B).
To identify the molecular machinery underlying 2D2 T cell-induced myeloid bias of HSCs, we performed high-throughput NanoString transcriptome sequencing of bone marrow HSCs obtained from 2D2 mice. HSCs from 2D2 mice display remarkable transcriptome changes ( Figure 6 C). Among the top upregulated genes in HSCs of 2D2 mice, genes related to myelopoiesis were highly upregulated ( Figure 6 C), particularly, CCR5, a myelopoiesis-related gene, was remarkably upregulated in HSCs of 2D2 mice ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Increases of CCL5-expressing CD4 + T cells and CCR5-expressing HSCs were also observed in the bone marrow of wild-type EAE mice ( Figures S6 C and S6D). In addition, an increase of CCL5-expressing T cells and CCR5-expressing HSCs was found in the bone marrow of MS patients ( Figure 6 E). Importantly, genetic knockdown of CCL5 ablated 2D2 T cell-induced bone marrow myelopoiesis, following passive transfer into Rag2 −/− recipients ( Figures 6 F–6I). These results suggest that the augmentation of bone marrow myelopoiesis involves the CCL5-CCR5 axis.
To assess whether disruption of bone marrow CCL5-CCR5 axis affects EAE pathology, we utilized bone marrow chimeric mice harboring CCR5 −/− or CCR5 +/+ HSCs. Sublethally irradiated wild-type (CD45.1) recipients received bone marrow injections of either CCR5 −/− (CD45.2) or wild-type CCR5 +/+ (CD45.2) Lin − cells and were induced for EAE development via i.v. injection of 2D2 T cells ( Figure 7 A). At day 14 after injection, we found lower percentages of HSCs and reduced counts of myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and Ly6C high monocytes in the bone marrows of mice receiving donor CCR5 −/− Lin − cells versus donor CCR5 +/+ Lin − cells ( Figures 7 B–7D), together with reduced CNS infiltration of neutrophils and Ly6C high monocytes ( Figure 7 E), suggesting that myelin-reactive T cells mainly increase the activity of CCR5 +/+ HSCs but not CCR5 −/− HSCs in the bone marrow of recipient mice. In addition, mice receiving donor CCR5 −/− Lin − cells displayed attenuated neurological deficits and CNS demyelination relative to recipient mice receiving donor CCR5 +/+ Lin − cells ( Figures 7 F and 7G).
Finally, we showed that pharmacological disruption of the CCL5-CCR5 axis in wild-type EAE mice using anti-CCL5 mAb ( Figures S7 A–S7D) or maraviroc, an FDA-approved CCR5 antagonist ( Figures S7 E–S7G) reduced neurological deficits, CNS demyelination, and leukocyte infiltration into spinal cord tissues, together with mitigated increase of HSCs, downstream myeloid progenitors (GMP and MDP), neutrophils, and Ly6C high monocytes in the bone marrow. Anti-CCL5 mAb treatment did not significantly alter the counts of bone marrow HSCs, downstream myeloid progenitors, monocytes, and neutrophils in naive wild-type mice ( Figure S7 D). In addition, maraviroc did not significantly alter the levels MOG 35 – 55 tetramer + T cells in the bone marrow, suggesting that CCR5 inhibition may not impair autoreactive T cell homing to bone marrow ( Figure S7 H).
Together, these results imply that disruption of the CCL5-CCR5 axis reduced bone marrow generation of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, alleviating the magnitude of neuroinflammation.

Section: Discussion

The prevailing study of the etiology of MS is focused on autoreactive T cells that penetrate the CNS. Once entering the CNS, these T cells undergo reactivation and initiate inflammatory demyelinating lesions. Although increasing evidence suggests the secondary involvement of neutrophils and monocytes in CNS inflammation during MS, the source and origin of these hematogenous cells remain unknown. This study assigns to the bone marrow a previously unrecognized role, as a facilitator governing the propagation of CNS inflammation and autoimmune injury. Single-cell analysis of bone marrow biopsy samples acquired from the treatment of naive patients with active MS unexpectedly revealed increased myelopoiesis but not lymphopoiesis of HSPCs, resulting in the dramatically augmented production of myeloid cells accompanied with clonal expansion of T cells. To gain mechanistic insights into these patient-derived findings, we performed a comprehensive investigation by coupling experiments in EAE mice to reveal the bone marrow as a preferential homing site for autoreactive T cells, which in turn augment myelopoiesis involving the CCL5-CCR5 axis. Lineage tracing revealed that myelopoiesis led to an increase of bone marrow myeloid cells that can invade the CNS and accelerate CNS inflammatory injury, together with biased TCR Vβ usage of CD4 + T cells in the femur and CNS-surrounding bone marrow. Importantly, disruption of the CCL5-CCR5 axis suppressed bone marrow myelopoiesis, neuroinflammation, and neurological deficits.
Our findings demonstrate the bone marrow as an early responder, which actively participates CNS inflammatory injury in MS. Coupling single-cell sequencing and flow cytometry analysis, we provide evidence that bone marrow HSPCs can sense immune system activation and adapt by skewing HSCs toward myeloid-cell lineages in patients with MS and mice with EAE. As for infectious diseases, augmented hematopoiesis of myeloid cells is often beneficial for the elimination of pathogens. Here, in the setting of CNS autoimmune diseases, newly generated neutrophils and monocytes are capable of propagating CNS inflammation during early disease development. Indeed, we observed enhanced myelopoiesis and output of myeloid cells into CNS as early as day 6 in EAE mice. As such, these findings assign a detrimental role to bone marrow myelopoiesis during EAE development, and perhaps during MS initiation and progression.
The finding that autoreactive T cells extensively migrate from blood into the bone marrow niche reveals bone marrow as a critical homing site for these T cells. At the crossroads of blood and immunity, bone marrow harbors a niche for hematopoietic cells and mature immune cells ( Di Rosa and Pabst, 2005 6. Di Rosa, F. ∙ Pabst, R.

In particular, skull and vertebral bone marrow have been reported to supply immune cells to meningeal borders and contribute to immune homeostasis in the CNS ( Brioschi et al., 2021 3. Brioschi, S. ∙ Wang, W.L. ∙ Peng, V. ...

Cerebrospinal fluid regulates skull bone marrow niches via direct access through dural channels Nat. Neurosci. 2022; 25 :555-560 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we highlight the homing of autoreactive T cells into both the remote femur and CNS-surrounding bone marrow to induce myelopoiesis. A major role in the recruitment of these cell types has been attributed to the chemokine CXCL12, i.e., stromal cell-derived factor-1, which is highly expressed by sinusoidal endothelial cells within the bone marrow. CXCL12 binds to its receptor CXCR4 and leads to attraction of target cells to the bone marrow ( Di Rosa and Pabst, 2005 6. Di Rosa, F. ∙ Pabst, R. The bone marrow: a nest for migratory memory T cells Trends Immunol. 2005; 26 :360-366 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). In EAE mice, we provide evidence that the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis is required for autoreactive (2D2) T cells to migrate into the bone marrow. Although the anatomical organization in which T cells are localized in bone marrow and the cellular components producing CXCL12 in the setting of EAE remain to be examined, the identification of bone marrow as a preferential homing site for autoreactive T cells sets the stage for future studies to better understand this role in the development of CNS autoimmunity and inflammation.
The finding that autoreactive T cells modulate hematopoiesis assigns a role for bone marrow-residing T cells in MS and EAE. Under physiological conditions, the activity of HSCs and downstream progenitors are tightly controlled by bone marrow niche factors to provide a balanced output of myeloid cells versus lymphocytes. In this study, we found that bone marrow-residing 2D2 T cells represents a major source of CCL5, which promotes myelopoiesis during EAE development. The augmented hematopoietic production of inflammatory neutrophils and monocytes contributes to CNS inflammation and disease progression. Notably, we also found clonal expansion of T cells in the bone marrow of MS patients, suggesting a potential impact of myelopoiesis on autoreactive T cell activity within the bone marrow niche. The current understanding of autoreactive T cells in MS pathogenesis is primarily focused on their expansion in lymphoid organs and penetration into the CNS. Our findings unveil the bone marrow as a previously unrecognized site which fosters the intimate interactions between autoreactive T cells and hematopoietic cells.
HSPCs in the bone marrow can rapidly sense immune system activation and adapt by producing new cells. MS is driven by a coordinated mobilization of innate and adaptive immunity. This study illustrates detrimental effects of bone marrow myelopoiesis, orchestrated by autoreactive T cells, in the setting of CNS inflammation and autoimmunity. Unlike this study, our previous research revealed that acute brain injury such as intracerebral hemorrhage skews bone marrow HSCs toward the myeloid-cell lineage, leading to increased production of Ly6C low patrolling monocytes, which in turn transmigrate into the injured brain and reduce neuroinflammation ( Shi et al., 2021 35. Shi, S.X. ∙ Shi, K. ∙ Liu, Q. Brain injury instructs bone marrow cellular lineage destination to reduce neuroinflammation Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13 :eabc7029 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). The self-protective effects of bone marrow myelopoiesis was switched on by an abrupt activation of adrenergic innervations following acute brain injury ( Shi et al., 2021 35. Shi, S.X. ∙ Shi, K. ∙ Liu, Q. Brain injury instructs bone marrow cellular lineage destination to reduce neuroinflammation Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13 :eabc7029 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), which underscores a dynamic interaction between lineage development in hematopoiesis and adrenergic activation following acute injury to brain or other peripheral organs ( Grisk, 2020 9. Grisk, O. The sympathetic nervous system in acute kidney injury Acta physiol. (Oxf). 2020; 228 :e13404 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meisel et al., 2005 25. Meisel, C. ∙ Schwab, J.M. ∙ Prass, K. ... Central nervous system injury-induced immune deficiency syndrome Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6 :775-786 Crossref Scopus (750) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve terminals that targets β3-adrenergic receptors within the bone marrow microenvironment. Here we report that bone marrow hematopoiesis is rewired toward myeloid lineages by autoreactive T cells homing to bone marrow, suggesting that the pro- or anti-inflammatory consequence of bone marrow myelopoiesis is likely determined by the initiators modulating bone marrow hematopoiesis.
Our findings have clinical relevance. First, myelopoiesis and its contribution to EAE development may open a therapeutic opportunity to treat MS. As the bone marrow is the site for both myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis, it is possible to reset and correct the aberrant immune response leading to MS, for example, via autologous HSC transplant ( Miller et al., 2021 27. Miller, A.E. ∙ Chitnis, T. ∙ Cohen, B.A. ..., National Medical Advisory Committee of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant in multiple sclerosis: recommendations of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society JAMA Neurol. 2021; 78 :241-246 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Muraro et al., 2017 29. Muraro, P.A. ∙ Martin, R. ∙ Mancardi, G.L. ... Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for treatment of multiple sclerosis Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2017; 13 :391-405 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, bone marrow-residing autoreactive T cells potentiated myelopoiesis involving the CCL5-CCR5 axis. These findings also extend the current understanding of autoreactive T cells within lymph organs and CNS into bone marrow. Restriction of autoreactive T cell migration toward the bone marrow may suppress detrimental myelopoiesis in MS. Third, many immune-suppressant drugs, such as methotrexate and azathioprine, can suppress myelopoiesis and cause neutropenia. Although myelosuppression is considered a major side effect for these cytotoxic chemotherapies, it is tempting to speculate that reduced myelopoiesis may potentially contribute to the benefit of immune-suppressing drugs, a topic is currently under investigation by our group.
The major finding of this work highlights that enhanced bone marrow myelopoiesis contributes to CNS inflammation and demyelination. The precise mechanisms for T cell clonal expansion and biased TCR Vβ usage following myelopoiesis in the bone marrow niche requires further investigation. In addition, conclusive evidence for the relative contributions to CNS inflammatory injury from CNS-surrounding bone marrow versus femur bone marrow has not been generated from the current study. Further, the association between aberrant HSPC activity and MS disease activity has not been examined. Similar approaches are needed to investigate bone marrow activities from different stages of MS and for MS patients receiving immune therapies. Although we identified that an FDA-approved CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc, suppresses myelopoiesis and EAE pathology, the precise contribution regarding myelopoiesis to its benefit on EAE pathology awaits future studies. Overcoming these limitations may provide a target for treatment of MS and other autoimmune disorders.

C57BL/6 mice, 2D2 mice, OT-II (OVA) mice, B6.Cg-Gt (ROSA) 26S mice, Fgd5-CreERT2, UBC-GFP, B6 CD45.1, CCR5 -/- mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Fgd5-creER-tdTomato mice were obtained by crossing Fgd5-CreERT2 mice with B6.Cg-Gt (ROSA) 26S mice as previously described ( Chapple et al., 2018 4. Chapple, R.H. ∙ Tseng, Y.J. ∙ Hu, T. ...

Male and female mice at age of 2-4 months were used in this study. All mutant mice were backcrossed to the B6 background for 8-12 generations. All mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and housed with no more than five animals per cage under standardized light-dark cycle conditions with ad libitum access to food and water. The vivarium was maintained under controlled temperature (21 ± 1°C) and humidity (50–60%). The experimental procedures used in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and Beijing Tiantan Hospital.
Reads from single cells isolated using 10x chromium were demultiplexed and then aligned to human genome (GRCh38), version 32 (Ensembl 98) using Cell Ranger (version 5.0.0, 10x Genomics) with default parameters, except for two settings to enrich neutrophils (“--force-cell” and “--intron-include”). Cells with fewer than 180 genes detected or with percent.mt (The Percentage of Reads that Map to The Mitochondrial Genome) higher than 10% were excluded from further analyses. The threshold of gene number was determined according to a protocol of 10X neutrophils enrichment ( https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/tutorials/neutrophils ).
For cell clustering and annotation, the R package Seurat (v.3.2.0) was utilized to process the profiles of cell expression in this study ( Stuart et al., 2019 36. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7328) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, we normalized the cell counts across all cells from the 14 samples, followed by scaling manipulation and converting to log scale with the function “NormalizeData” by default. Then, the normalized values were used to select highly variable genes (HVGs) with the “FindVariableFeatures” function (selection.method = “mvp”). Furthermore, the expression profiles of HVGs were converted to z-scores using the function “ScaleData” (meanwhile to regress out unwanted variables by vars.to.regress = “percent.mt”). Principle components (PCs) were estimated based on the selected HVGs with the function “RunPCA”, and the first 15 PCs explaining more than 80% of the overall variation were selected for downstream analysis. Harmony package (v1.0) ( Korsunsky et al., 2019 16. Korsunsky, I. ∙ Millard, N. ∙ Fan, J. ... Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1289-1296 Crossref Scopus (2853) PubMed Google Scholar ) was implemented to remove batch effects of samples. The two functions “FindNeighbors” and “FindClusters” were implemented to find clusters of expression-similar cells with empirically set resolutions, and “resolution = 0.5” was used in the downstream analyses. Force-direct graphs were created on the nearest neighbor graphs with 1000 iterations. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each cluster relative to the remaining clusters were identified by the function “FindAllMarkers”.
To annotate cell identity of the clusters, we curated a list of canonical gene markers for various cell types including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), downstream progenitors and terminally differentiated cells. A cluster was assigned as a canonical identity based on enriched expression of the marker genes, which listed in the DEGs identified. HSPC population was further clustered and reannotated by canonical progenitor markers used in a previous study ( Wang et al., 2021 38. Wang, X. ∙ Wen, Y. ∙ Xie, X. ... Dysregulated hematopoiesis in bone marrow marks severe COVID-19 Cell Discov. 2021; 7 :60 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The stemness scores of each cell in the HSPC population were estimated using the “AddModuleScore” function in Seurat, feed with a list of reference signature genes of HSC cells as described previously ( Xie et al., 2021 39. Xie, X. ∙ Liu, M. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Single-cell transcriptomic landscape of human blood cells Natl. Sci. Rev. 2021; 8 :nwaa180 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, each score was generated by calculating total gene expression for each of the analyzed genes and separating them into 25 bins of similar expression. For every gene in each target signature, 100 “control” genes were selected from its corresponding bin and added to a “control” gene sets. The resulting “control” gene sets contained and equivalent expression distribution as the target signature and its average represents an equivalent sampling of 100 genes of equal size to the target gene set. The expression of genes in the target gene set and the “control” gene set were averaged across each cell to generate a target score (STarget) and control score (SCtrl). The cell’s score for the target gene set (SGene) is the difference between the target score and control score: SGene = STarget − SCtrl. To determine statistical significance, we used the unpaired Wilcox test with a 95% confidence interval. HSC signature genes: CD34, AVP, CRHBP, PROM1, SPINK2, MLLT3, NPR3, TAOK3, ELMO1, MYCT1, SELL, HLF, CLU, NKAIN2, HOPX, SERPINB1, FXYD5, MMRN1, BAALC, LRBA, MEIS1, TFPI, DPPA4, GNAI1, CRYGD, ATP1B1, RBPMS, CALN1, HMGA2.
The signature genes were used to perform gene module analysis at stratified HSC data of different conditions. To identify signature gene modules at the early turning points during HSC differentiation, HSCs were stratified for every 10% range of stemness score estimated above (e.g. from 0-10% to 90–100%). The spearman correlation of signature gene expression was assessed for each stratified HSC population.
The single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) was used to explore the regulatory landscape based on normalized expression levels of scRNA-seq data. Only genes expressed in at least 1% of HSCs were retained to construct the regulatory network. The transcription factors and directly regulated genes were identified as regulons. The student’s t test (R 3.6.2, two-sided, unadjusted for multiple comparisons) was used to analyze differences of AUCell scores in MS patients and controls. Differentially activated regulons with a P value < 0.05 were selected for further clustering based on the AUCell score in each single cell (R package ComplexHeatmap, version 2.8.0).
The “FindMarkers” was applied to detect the DEGs between the control and MS samples. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the DEGs were performed with R package “clusterProfiler (3.14.3)”. For TCR analysis, re-clustering and annotation were performed on T cells to identify cell subtypes. The t-SNE algorithm was used for visualization of clustering. For differential expression analysis, markers for each cluster were determined by comparing the cells of each cluster to all other cells using the Find Markers function in Seurat with the MAST algorithm. For each cluster, only genes expressed by at least 10% of cells were included. Finally, Clusters were annotated based on the expression of known maker genes. For downstream analysis, we removed those low-quality cells (HBB + ), natural killer cells (NCAM1 + ), innate lymphoid cells (STAT4 + ) and visualized the T cells with t-SNE.
The TCR sequences for each single cell from the 10x Genomics data were assembled by the Cell Ranger (version 5.0.0, 10x Genomics, leading to the identification of the CDR3 sequence, the rearranged TCR genes and their expression abundance. Only in-frame TCR alpha-beta pairs were considered to define the dominant TCR of a single cell. Each unique dominant alpha-beta pair was defined as a clonotype. If one clonotype was present in at least two cells, this clonotype would be considered clonal, and the number of cells with such dominant alpha-beta pair indicated the degree of clonality of the clonotype. If one clonotype was present in only one cell, this clonotype would be considered unique.
Lin - bone marrow cells were isolated from donor CCR5 -/- (CD45.2) mice and wild type (CCR5 +/+ , CD45.2) mice using a mouse hematopoietic progenitor cell isolation kit. In brief, femur bone marrow cells of donor mice were incubated with Biotin antibody cocktails for 30 min on ice, and then incubated with streptavidin nanobeads for 15 min. Thereafter, cells were washed with working buffer (2% FBS/PBS) and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in the tube containing working buffer, and then placed in the magnet. After 5 min, cells were poured out with the tube still in the magnet, and then Lin - cells were collected. Recipient mice were irradiated with a sublethal dose (600 rad) before Lin - cell transplantation. At 4 h after irradiation, recipient mice received Lin - cells via femur bone marrow injection. Each mouse received 4x10 5 Lin - cells. After injection, mice were housed in recovery cages and fed with antibiotics-containing water. One day after transplantation, bone marrow chimeric mice received i.v. injection of 2D2 CD4 + T cells to induce passive EAE.
To induce EAE, eight- to 12-week-old mice were injected subcutaneously with an emulsion contains 200 μg MOG 35-55 in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) containing 500 μg of nonviable, desiccated Mycobacterium tuberculosis at a concentration of 10 mg/mL on upper and lower back. Mice were i.p. injected with 200 ng pertussis toxin (PT) 2 hours later, and then repeated 2 days after immunization. For adoptive transfer of EAE with myelin-reactive T cells, splenocytes were isolated from MOG TCR transgenic (2D2) or wild type EAE mice. After removal of red blood cells by ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer, splenocytes were collected and suspended in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS. T cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml MOG 35−55 peptide for 48 h, and then expanded in 5 ng/ml IL-2 and IL-7 for 5 days. Lymphoblasts were stimulated with 1 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-12 and 25 ng/ml IL-18 for 24 h. 2x10 6 FACS-sorted 2D2 T cells (CD4 + CD25 - Vβ11 + ) or wild type CD4 + T cells were i.v. injected into each recipient mouse. For both actively and passively induced EAE, mice were monitored daily for neurological deficits and body weight using an arbitrary scale of 0 to 5 with 0.5 increments as follows: 0, no signs; 1, fully limp tail; 2, hindlimb weakness; 3, hindlimb paralysis; 4, forelimb paralysis; 5, moribund. The assessment of clinical scores was performed in a blinded manner.
Mice were sacrificed by lethal anesthesia via isoflurane, blood, spleen, lymph nodes, femur, skull and vertebral bone were then collected for further dissociation of cells. For blood, red blood cells were lysed by adding 1mL ACK lysis buffer to 100 μL blood at room temperature for 15 min. After centrifugation and washed in PBS, cells were resuspended in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for antibody staining. To isolate splenocytes, tissues were grinded through a 70μm cell strainer. After washing with PBS, red blood cells were then lysed in ACK lysis buffer. Followed by washing with PBS, cells were then resuspended in 1% BSA. To obtain bone marrow cells, bone marrow was flushed out with cold PBS through the femur, skull and vertebral bone were cut into small pieces and then filtered through a 70μm cell strainer, ACK lysis buffer was then added to remove red blood cells, after washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in 1% BSA. Brain and spinal cord were removed after pericardial perfusion with cold PBS. Whole brain and spinal cord tissue were then minced and incubated in collagenase IV at 37°C for 30min, after washing with PBS, myelin debris were removed by centrifuging in 30% percoll (Sigma Aldrich), cell pellet was then washed by PBS and resuspended in 1% BSA. Fluorescence-conjugated antibodies were then added to cell suspensions and stained for 30min on ice. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed in fixation buffer for 20min after surface marker staining, and then washed in permeabilization buffer twice. Antibodies targeting intracellular molecules were then added and stained for 45min. Cells were then washed and suspended in flow cytometry buffer.
To measure antigen-specific T cells, a MOG 35-55 tetramer (Allele: I-A b , MBL) was used. In brief, single cell suspensions of spleen, blood, or bone marrow was first stained with MOG 35-55 tetramer for 60 min at room temperature, after which, anti-CD3 and CD4 antibodies was then added to the solution and incubate for another 30 min. After washing with PBS, cell pellet was resuspended in 500μL PBS and analyzed by flow cytometer. To determine TCR Vβ usage, we used a mouse VβTCR screening panel, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, single cell suspensions of spleen, femur, skull, and vertebral bone marrow were prepared as aforementioned, each sample was then divided into 15 separate FACS tubes and stained for the Ab mixture, including 1 of 15 respective FITC-conjugated Vβ mAbs.
All antibodies used in flow cytometry staining are listed in the key resources table . Data were collected by a FACSAria III flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software.
BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in PBS containing 15% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and injected intraperitoneally to mice at a dosage of 150 mg/kg 1 day before sacrificing. Cells were intracellularly stained with a BV510 anti-mouse BrdU (3D4, BD) antibody to measure BrdU incorporation.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription of FACS sorted HSCs were performed via a UniCell to cDNA Synthesis SuperMix following manufacturer’s instruction. RNA levels of stemness genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in triplicate on an ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Life technologies, USA) using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX) (Roche, Basle, Switzerland). The RNA levels were normalized against GAPDH using the ΔΔCt method. The gene list and primers we present in key resources table .
At day 14 post-immunization, 18 F-FDG PET-CT imaging was conducted to in vivo evaluate the bone marrow activity of EAE mice. Mice were intravenously injected with 100 μCi of 18 F-FDG. One hour after injection, mice were scanned in a merged micro-PET-CT scanner (Novel Imaging, Beijing). Images were acquired on a field of view of 80 cm by 80 cm (160 pixels x 160 pixels) and then reconstructed to a three-dimensional projection (336 pixels x 160 pixels x 160 pixels). Vertebral bones and femur bones from both sides were localized on CT images and measured. The radioactivity was quantified using mean standard uptake value (SUV).
Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol/corn oil (1:9) at a concentration of 30 mg/ml, Fgd5-creER-tdTomato mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 μL (3 mg per mouse) daily for 5 consecutive days. An anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (247506, R&D Systems) was given intraperitoneally to 2D2 mice at a dosage of 100μg per mouse. To blocking CCL5’s effect, an anti-CCL5 mAb (53405, R&D Systems) was given to EAE mice at a dosage of 50μg per mouse. Controlled mice received an IgG control treatment at a same regimen. A CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc (HY-13004, MedChemExpress) was dissolved in 10% DMSO + 40% PEG300 + 5% Tween-80 + 45% saline and given intraperitoneally to EAE mice at a dosage 50 mg/kg daily.
2D2 T cells (CD45 + CD3 + CD4 + ) sorted from bone marrow of 2D2 mice were lysed, and supernatant were collected for proteome profiling. CD4 + T cells sorted from wild type mice were used as control. The collected supernatants were analyzed by a mouse proteome profiler kit (R&D systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Bone marrow HSCs were FACS-sorted from 2D2 mice and naïve wild type mice into TRIzol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific)-containing tubed. RNAs of HSCs were then extracted. Transcriptome sequencing was then conducted by NanoString by using a mouse immunity panel following the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing data were processed and analyzed with nSolver4.0 (NanoString Technologies), heat map was generated via an online software (Morpheus).
CD4 + T cells were isolated from spleen tissues of donor mice. Highly purified cells (>95%) were then transfected with small interfering siRNA target CCL5 or CXCR4, or control siRNA. The transfection procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, in each well, 150 pmol siRNA duplex and 5 μL Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were gently diluted in 250 μL Opti-MEM respectively. The diluted siRNA duplex and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were then combined together and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then, the combined transfection reagents were added into 2.5 mL growth medium with 3-4 x 10 6 cell per well. The cells were then incubated at 37°C and the medium was changed after 5 hours. After culturing for 24 hours, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. 2 x 10 6 cells were then injected intravenously to recipient mouse via i.v. injection.
H&E staining of spinal cord sections was conducted to visualize inflammatory infiltration, the staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luxol Fast blue staining was performed to visualize the demyelination of spinal cord. A series of spinal cord sections were dewaxed in water and then stained in 0.1% Luxol Fast Blue (LFB; Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 8h at 60 °C. After washing in distilled water, the slides were placed in 95% alcohol for 10min. Slices were then separated in 0.05% lithium carbonate aqueous solution (Leagene) for 10s and then in 70% alcohol solution for 20s. The above two steps were repeated until the white matter and grey matter are clearly differentiated. The slides were then dehydrated and sealed with neutral gum. Images were captured by a microscope and analyzed by Image J.
