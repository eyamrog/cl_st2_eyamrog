Title: Initiation of Parental Genome Reprogramming in Fertilized Oocyte by Splicing Kinase SRPK1-Catalyzed Protamine Phosphorylation


Abstract: Summary

The paternal genome undergoes a massive exchange of histone with protamine for compaction into sperm during spermiogenesis. Upon fertilization, this process is potently reversed, which is essential for parental genome reprogramming and subsequent activation; however, it remains poorly understood how this fundamental process is initiated and regulated. Here, we report that the previously characterized splicing kinase SRPK1 initiates this life-beginning event by catalyzing site-specific phosphorylation of protamine, thereby triggering protamine-to-histone exchange in the fertilized oocyte. Interestingly, protamine undergoes a DNA-dependent phase transition to gel-like condensates and SRPK1-mediated phosphorylation likely helps open up such structures to enhance protamine dismissal by nucleoplasmin (NPM2) and enable the recruitment of HIRA for H3.3 deposition. Remarkably, genome-wide assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis reveals that selective chromatin accessibility in both sperm and MII oocytes is largely erased in early pronuclei in a protamine phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting that SRPK1-catalyzed phosphorylation initiates a highly synchronized reorganization program in both parental genomes.

Section: Introduction

Histones have been long known to be gradually replaced by protamines during spermiogenesis (histone-to-protamine exchange) in order to tightly package paternal DNA into the sperm head, resulting in a 10- to 20-fold reduction in nuclear volume to ensure transmission of genetic information to offspring with both high fidelity and efficiency ( Balhorn, 2007; Oliva, 2006 5.

Update. 2006; 12 :417-435 Crossref Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). After fertilization, the paternal genome undergoes a programmed reversal of histone-to-protamine exchange in the egg ( Adenot et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2014 1.

Despite the rapid progress in delineating these pre-implantation developmental events, especially by recent genomic profiling of different stages during embryonic development ( Du et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016, 2018; Xia et al., 2019 14.

Resetting histone modifications during human parental-to-zygotic transition Science. 2019; 365 :353-360 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ), our understanding remains primitive as to how the whole process is initiated shortly after the sperm enters the egg.
Protamines are a class of small, highly arginine (Arg)-enriched nuclear proteins, which are thought to evolve from specialized histones through protamine-like proteins to true protamines ( Balhorn, 2007 5. Balhorn, R. The protamine family of sperm nuclear proteins Genome Biol. 2007; 8 :227 Crossref Scopus (558) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Xenopus , for example, the sperm contains several basic proteins that resemble protamine plus classic H3 and H4, and during post-fertilization chromatin remodeling, those protamine-like proteins are replaced by maternal H2A and H2B ( Prado et al., 2004 55. Prado, A. ∙ Ramos, I. ∙ Frehlick, L.J. ... Nucleoplasmin: a nuclear chaperone Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82 :437-445 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mammals, protamine 1 (P1) is primarily responsible for packaging sperm DNA, although a second protamine, P2, is additionally involved in primates, some rodents, and a subset of placental mammals ( Balhorn, 1989; Lee and Cho, 1999 4. Balhorn, R. Mammalian Protamines: Structure and Molecular Interactions Adolph, K.W. (Editor) Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function Springer, 1989 Crossref Google Scholar 34. Lee, C.H. ∙ Cho, Y.H. Aspects of mammalian spermatogenesis: electrophoretical analysis of protamines in mammalian species Mol. Cells. 1999; 9 :556-559 PubMed Google Scholar ). During spermiogenesis in mouse testis, typical histones are first replaced by transition proteins and then P1 and P2 ( Oliva, 2006 47. Oliva, R. Protamines and male infertility Hum. Reprod. Update. 2006; 12 :417-435 Crossref Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). According to the Balhorn model proposed more than three decades ago ( Balhorn, 1982 3. Balhorn, R. A model for the structure of chromatin in mammalian sperm J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93 :298-305 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ), which obviously needs refinement with direct structural evidence, the Arg-rich core of protamine binds the phosphate backbone of genomic DNA, which is then stacked on one another to form a sheet-like structure locked by inter-protamine disulfide bridges. Remarkably, such tightly packed chromatin is rapidly decondensed in the fertilized egg, which is facilitated by released proteins from the nucleus of the oocyte upon germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Fundamental, but still unsolved, questions are which protein(s) catalyzes the protamine replacement with histones and how the process might be regulated.
Multiple acidic protein factors have been implicated in mediating protamine-to-histone exchange in the fertilized egg. The primary candidate is nucleoplasmin (NPM), which is the most abundant protein in matured oocytes. Immunodepletion of NPM from Xenopus oocyte extracts blocked, while purified NPM induced, sperm DNA decondensation in vitro ( Inoue et al., 2011; Philpott and Leno, 1992; Philpott et al., 1991; Shintomi et al., 2015, 2017 26.

Mitotic chromosome assembly despite nucleosome depletion in Xenopus egg extracts Science. 2017; 356 :1284-1287 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, sperm DNA decondensation still occurred when the major NPM gene ( NPM2 ) was genetically ablated in mice ( Burns et al., 2003 8. Burns, K.H. ∙ Viveiros, M.M. ∙ Ren, Y. ... Roles of NPM2 in chromatin and nucleolar organization in oocytes and embryos Science. 2003; 300 :633-636 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ). This might be due to redundant functions of the other two relatively minor NPM family members, NPM1 and NPM3 , expressed in mouse oocytes ( Okuwaki et al., 2012 46. Okuwaki, M. ∙ Sumi, A. ∙ Hisaoka, M. ... Function of homo- and hetero-oligomers of human nucleoplasmin/nucleophosmin family proteins NPM1, NPM2 and NPM3 during sperm chromatin remodeling Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :4861-4878 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, template-activating factor 1β (TAF1β) also exhibited a similar sperm DNA decondensation activity in vitro ( Matsumoto et al., 1999 43. Matsumoto, K. ∙ Nagata, K. ∙ Miyaji-Yamaguchi, M. ... Sperm chromatin decondensation by template activating factor I through direct interaction with basic proteins Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 :6940-6952 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, multiple proteins may be involved in protamine removal independently or cooperatively. Accompanying with protamine removal, histones are incorporated for de novo assembly of nucleosomes and the H3.3 chaperone HIRA is thought to play a major role in this process ( Inoue and Zhang, 2014; Lin et al., 2014; Loppin et al., 2005 25.

The histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA is essential for chromatin assembly in the male pronucleus Nature. 2005; 437 :1386-1390 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ), perhaps in synergy with the chromatin remodeler CHD1 ( Konev et al., 2007 32. Konev, A.Y. ∙ Tribus, M. ∙ Park, S.Y. ... CHD1 motor protein is required for deposition of histone variant H3.3 into chromatin in vivo Science. 2007; 317 :1087-1090 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, sperm DNA was still able to undergo decondensation without HIRA or CHD1 ( Inoue and Zhang, 2014; Konev et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2014 25. Inoue, A. ∙ Zhang, Y. Nucleosome assembly is required for nuclear pore complex assembly in mouse zygotes Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :609-616 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar 32.

Cell. 2014; 30 :268-279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that protamine removal and histone deposition may be coordinated, but not necessarily tightly coupled.
Compared to specific factors involved in the protamine-to-histone exchange, even less is known about how the process is regulated. Both protamine and NPM are known to be phosphorylated, and NPM phosphorylation appears to enhance its ability to decondense sperm DNA in vitro ( Bañuelos et al., 2007; Leno et al., 1996 6.

Mammalian protamines contain several potential phosphorylation sites ( Chirat et al., 1993; Pirhonen et al., 1993 9. Chirat, F. ∙ Arkhis, A. ∙ Martinage, A. ...

Reprod. 1993; 48 :821-827 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ), one of which in mouse P2 appears to play a regulatory role during spermiogenesis ( Itoh et al., 2019 28.

Signal. 2019; 12 :eaao7232 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple kinases have also been implicated in phosphorylating protamines ( Papoutsopoulou et al., 1999; Pirhonen et al., 1994; Wu et al., 2000 48.

Spermiogenesis and exchange of basic nuclear proteins are impaired in male germ cells lacking Camk4 Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :448-452 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ), but all studies to date were based on in vitro phosphorylation assays with purified kinases, thus lacking direct evidence for the physiological kinase-substrate relationship, which has to be established by both loss- and gain-of-function studies with candidate kinase and defined phosphorylation site(s) in the substrate.
In this study, we demonstrate that protamines are extended members of the Ser/Arg-rich (SR) family of proteins, which are best known for their functions in pre-mRNA splicing ( Fu, 1995; Lin and Fu, 2007; Zhong et al., 2009 17.

SR proteins in vertical integration of gene expression from transcription to RNA processing to translation Mol. Cell. 2009; 35 :1-10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). SR proteins are well known to be regulated from nuclear import to spliceosome assembly by evolutionarily conserved SR protein-specific kinases (SRPKs) ( Giannakouros et al., 2011; Zhou and Fu, 2013 18. Giannakouros, T. ∙ Nikolakaki, E. ∙ Mylonis, I. ... Serine-arginine protein kinases: a small protein kinase family with a large cellular presence FEBS J. 2011; 278 :570-586 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar 75. Zhou, Z. ∙ Fu, X.D. Regulation of splicing by SR proteins and SR protein-specific kinases Chromosoma. 2013; 122 :191-207 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mammalian genomes encode for three SRPKs: SRPK1 is ubiquitously expressed with the highest expression in germ cells ( Papoutsopoulou et al., 1999 48. Papoutsopoulou, S. ∙ Nikolakaki, E. ∙ Chalepakis, G. ... SR protein-specific kinase 1 is highly expressed in testis and phosphorylates protamine 1 Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27 :2972-2980 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas SRPK2 and SRPK3 are largely restricted to neurons and muscles, respectively ( Nakagawa et al., 2005; Wang et al., 1998 45. Nakagawa, O. ∙ Arnold, M. ∙ Nakagawa, M. ... Centronuclear myopathy in mice lacking a novel muscle-specific protein kinase transcriptionally regulated by MEF2 Genes Dev. 2005; 19 :2066-2077 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Wang, H.Y. ∙ Lin, W. ∙ Dyck, J.A. ...

Cell Biol. 1998; 140 :737-750 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). We now show that SRPK1 and two SRPK1-catalyzed phosphorylation sites in P1 in mice are vital for initiating protamine-to-histone exchange in the fertilized egg by facilitating direct protamine interactions with NPM2 for protamine removal and HIRA for H3.3 deposition to drive synchronized reprogramming of both paternal and maternal genomes. These findings establish a central, splicing-independent function of SRPK1 in catalyzing one of the earliest life events in mammals.

Section: Results

Both mammalian P1 and P2 are highly enriched with Ser/Arg dipeptides characteristic of SR proteins, which are uniquely recognized by SRPKs ( Gui et al., 1994a, 1994b; Colwill et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1998 10.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140 :737-750 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). To begin to test the hypothesis that SRPK1 might play a key role in zygotic development by phosphorylating protamines to trigger protamine-to-histone exchange, we performed immunostaining on both germline vesicle (GV) and Metaphase II (MII) oocytes with a specific antibody against SRPK1. By confocal microscopy, we found that SRPK1 was diffusely distributed throughout the GV oocyte in which interchromatin granules (also known as nuclear speckles) were detectable within GV by anti-SC35; in contrast, nuclear speckles are “melted” by excessive SRPK1 as a consequence of GVBD in the MII oocyte ( Figures 1 A and S1 A), as seen in somatic cells during mitosis ( Gui et al., 1994a; Ding et al., 2006 13. Ding, J.H. ∙ Zhong, X.Y. ∙ Hagopian, J.C. ... Regulated cellular partitioning of SR protein-specific kinases in mammalian cells Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17 :876-885 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar 21. Gui, J.F. ∙ Lane, W.S. ∙ Fu, X.D. A serine kinase regulates intracellular localization of splicing factors in the cell cycle Nature. 1994; 369 :678-682 Crossref Scopus (474) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, SRPK2 was largely undetectable ( Figure S1 B). Notably, SRPK1 became associated with some patches in the MII oocyte, which likely resulted from remaining interchromatin granules released from the broken GV, which has also been reported in somatic cells during mitosis ( Spector et al., 1991 58. Spector, D.L. ∙ Fu, X.D. ∙ Maniatis, T. Associations between distinct pre-mRNA splicing components and the cell nucleus EMBO J. 1991; 10 :3467-3481 Crossref Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine if SRPK1 is required for preimplantation embryonic development upon in vitro fertilization (IVF) of mouse eggs ( Figure 1 B), we first took advantage of a newly developed SRPK1 inhibitor SRPKIN-1 ( Figure S1 C), which forms a specific covalent bond with a tyrosine phenol group uniquely present in the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase ( Hatcher et al., 2018 24. Hatcher, J.M. ∙ Wu, G. ∙ Zeng, C. ... SRPKIN-1: A Covalent SRPK1/2 Inhibitor that Potently Converts VEGF from Pro-angiogenic to Anti-angiogenic Isoform Cell Chem. Biol. 2018; 25 :460-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). SRPKIN-1 treatment had no effect on fertilization, based on the presence of both gametes detected by DAPI staining, but blocked the transition of fertilized eggs from 1-cell to 2-cell embryos in a dosage-dependent manner, as indicated by the reduction of 2-cell embryos from 83.3% of mock (DMSO) treated eggs to 48.2% and 17.4% of eggs respectively treated with 1 μM and 10 μM of SRPKIN-1 ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 D). A control compound JH-VII-206-2, which has a structure similar to SRPKIN-1, but cannot bind SRPK1 ( Figure S1 C), showed little effect (74.3% at 1 μM and 62.5% at 10 μM) on zygotic development ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 D). These dosage-dependent effects mirrored paternal DNA that remained in the condensed state, showing a significant population of zygotes with condensed paternal DNA in SRPKIN-1-treated, but not control compound-treated, eggs ( Figure S1 E). These observations strongly suggest a key role of maternal SRPK1 in driving paternal genome decondensation in fertilized eggs.
Given the possibility that chemical inhibitors might have some general toxic effects, we next took a genetic approach to further establish the functional requirement of SRPK1 in early development. To this end, we utilized heterozygous SRPK1 +/− mice we previously generated ( Wang et al., 2014 62. Wang, P. ∙ Zhou, Z. ∙ Hu, A. ... Both decreased and increased SRPK1 levels promote cancer by interfering with PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), taking advantage of differential transcriptional silencing in late stage GV oocytes before reaching the MII stage ( Bouniol-Baly et al., 1999 7. Bouniol-Baly, C. ∙ Hamraoui, L. ∙ Guibert, J. ... Differential transcriptional activity associated with chromatin configuration in fully grown mouse germinal vesicle oocytes Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60 :580-587 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that, if the wild-type copy of SRPK1 in heterozygous SRPK1 +/− oocytes became silenced earlier before ovulation, such oocytes would have a degree of reduced SRPK1 mRNA and protein. Indeed, we found that 12.5% to 21.7% of in vitro fertilized eggs from SRPK1 +/− females were arrested at the 1-cell stage, compared to ∼2.5% of inseminated oocytes from SRPK1 +/+ females ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 F). This partial effect likely resulted from incomplete depletion of SRPK1 protein, and if so, we would predict a negative correlation between remaining SRPK1 levels and developmental arrest. We therefore divided the fertilized eggs into three categories based on the immunostaining intensity of SRPK1 (negative, intermediate, and positive according to ImageJ) and found that ∼4 h post-insemination, the majority of SRPK1-negative zygotes (60% to 80%) failed to decondense their paternal genome; many fewer zygotes (20% to 30%) with intermediate SRPK1 staining showed this phenotype; and most SRPK1-positive zygotes developed normally ( Figures 1 G and S1 G). This correlative evidence strongly suggests a central role of SRPK1 in zygotic development by promoting paternal genome decondensation.
Because SRPK1 protein was only partially depleted in oocytes from SRPK1 +/− females, we took a third approach to further demonstrate the requirement of SRPK1 for paternal genome decondensation. To this end, we followed a previously established microinjection protocol to deplete maternal mRNA during oocyte growth, which also allows complementation with exogenous mRNA ( Inoue et al., 2014; Inoue and Zhang, 2014 25. Inoue, A. ∙ Zhang, Y. Nucleosome assembly is required for nuclear pore complex assembly in mouse zygotes Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :609-616 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Inoue, A. ∙ Sunaga, K. ∙ Aoki, F. ... siRNA-Mediated Depletion of Stable Proteins in Mouse Oocytes Protoc. Exch. 2014; Crossref Google Scholar ). We isolated growing oocytes from young females and injected them with an established small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SRPK1 (see STAR Methods ), and after in vitro culture to allow oocyte growth, ∼70% of injected oocytes were able to progress to the MII stage by day 13 ( Figure S2 A), and these were used for IVF ( Figure 2 A). Using this strategy, we successfully depleted maternal SRPK1, as evidenced by negative staining in resulting zygotes after IVF, and found that SRPK1 depletion largely prevented paternal genome decondensation ( Figures 2 B and 2D–2F, panels I and II), leading to a potent blockage of zygotic development, as only 13.8% of siSRPK1-treated zygotes progressed to the 2-cell stage, whereas 79.6% of scrambled (Scr) siRNA-treated zygotes developed normally ( Figures 2 C and S2 B).
Importantly, the defect could be functionally rescued by co-injecting a siRNA-resistant human SRPK1 mRNA (note that human SRPK1 is nearly identical to mouse SRPK1) ( Figures 2 B and 2D–2F, panel III), as indicated by the restoration of 2-cell embryos from 13.8% to 56.5% ( Figures 2 C and S2 B). Consistent with our hypothesis that SRPK1 may catalyze protamine dismissal, we found that P1 remained on condensed paternal chromatin in SRPK1-depleted zygotes, but was removed in the presence of exogenous SRPK1 ( Figures 2 B and 2D–2F). These results demonstrated that SRPK1 is necessary to facilitate paternal genome decondensation and protamine removal, which is required for zygotic development beyond the 1-cell stage. This functional complementation system also enabled us to ask whether the kinase activity of SRPK1 is essential for early zygotic development. We thus co-injected developing oocytes with a kinase-dead version of human SRPK1 (KD). As predicted, although SRPK1 expression was fully restored, the paternal genome still remained condensed along with P1 ( Figures 2 B–2F, panel IV). Considering together the three lines of evidence from chemical, genetic, and functional complementation studies, we conclude that kinase-active, maternal SRPK1 is required for catalyzing protamine eviction to allow paternal genome decondensation.
SRPK1 is a Ser-specific kinase and exclusively requires an adjacent Arg for signaling site-specific phosphorylation ( Gui et al., 1994b 22. Gui, J.F. ∙ Tronchère, H. ∙ Chandler, S.D. ... Purification and characterization of a kinase specific for the serine- and arginine-rich pre-mRNA splicing factors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91 :10824-10828 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inspection of P1 and P2 indicates 4 and 6 potential phosphorylation sites in them where all 4 Ser residues in P1 and 4 out of 6 Ser residues in P2 are flanked by an Arg residue ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). To begin to determine which of these potential sites are phosphorylated by SRPK1, we first performed in vitro phosphorylation with purified kinase on candidate substrates. Because P1 is small (51 aa) and P2 is relatively larger (107 aa), we chemically synthesized full-length P1 and 3 fragments of P2 as well as various Ala substitution mutations in candidate Ser residues, either singly or in combination ( Figures 3 A and S3 A), and then tested their phosphorylation with purified SRPK1 in vitro . Quantitative analysis of incorporated phosphate into wild-type and mutant substrates suggested that SRPK1 was able to phosphorylate P1 at Ser9 and Ser43 ( Figures 3 B, S3 B, and S3C) and P2 at Ser8, Ser10, Ser56, and Ser69 ( Figure S3 D). We noted that one of these mapped SRPK1 phosphorylation sites (Ser56) in P2 corresponds to a recently characterized phosphorylation event important for functional interaction with a testis-specific phosphatase ( Itoh et al., 2019 28. Itoh, K. ∙ Kondoh, G. ∙ Miyachi, H. ... Dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 is crucial for murine sperm maturation in vivo Sci. Signal. 2019; 12 :eaao7232 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with a potential role of SRPK1-regulated protamine phosphorylation in sperm production during spermiogenesis.
Because P1 is universally involved in paternal genome packaging in mammals, and P2 is species-specific, we focused on establishing in vivo phosphorylation events in P1 and their functional significance in subsequent studies. To this end, we synthesized phosphorylated P1 at individual candidate sites and used these phospho-peptides to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits ( Figure S3 E). Affinity-purified antibodies showed the expected specificity in dot blotting, as individual antibodies reacted with their prospective phospho-peptide antigens without cross-reactions with others ( Figure S3 F). We next used these reagents to determine if SRPK1 is responsible for protamine phosphorylation in vivo . By immunostaining on both epididymal sperm and zygote 1 h post-IVF, an optimal time window for us to detect P1 phosphorylation before its dismissal from the paternal genome ( Figure S3 G), we detected clear fluorescence signals on paternal chromatin with both anti-P1-pSer9 and anti-P1-pSer43 antibodies in fertilized eggs ( Figures 3 C and 3D), but not with anti-P1-pSer11 and anti-P1-pSer13 antibodies ( Figure S3 H). In contrast, both anti-P1-pSer9 and anti-P1-pSer43 antibodies stained negatively on epididymal sperm, and given positive staining with total P1, these data indicate that P1 is unphosphorylated at these two sites in mature sperm ( Figures 3 C and 3D). These data establish site-specific phosphorylation of P1 at Ser9 and Ser43 residues in fertilized eggs.
To determine if P1-Ser9 and P1-Ser43 were indeed phosphorylated by SRPK1, we again utilized the functional rescue system (see Figure 2 ). We found that the P1-pSer9 signal was readily detectable in control siRNA-treated oocyte 1 h post-IVF, but such signal vanished in SRPK1-depleted oocyte, and significantly, exogenous active SRPK1, but not the kinase-dead version of the kinase, restored the signal ( Figure 3 E). Importantly, at this critical window when P1 still remained on paternal chromatin, quantitative analysis revealed that the immunostaining intensities of total P1 were inversely correlated with its phosphorylation levels in the presence of active SRPK1 ( Figures 3 F–3H). We obtained the same results with P1-pSer43 ( Figure S3 I). These data further established the specificity of the phospho-specific antibodies we raised and demonstrated P1 phosphorylation at Ser9 and Ser43 by maternal SRPK1 immediately after the sperm enters the egg to facilitate P1 dismissal from the paternal genome.
To demonstrate the importance of SRPK1-catalyzed P1 phosphorylation in the physiological setting, we sought to introduce specific mutations in P1 knockin mice. For this purpose, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce Ser-to-Ala mutations at Ser9 and Ser43 either singly or in combination ( Figures 4 A and S4 A). We obtained homozygous mice and confirmed the intended mutations by Sanger sequencing ( Figure S4 B). We also selected a set of genomic regions based on sequence similarity to our guide RNAs to examine potential off-target effects, and by PCR and Sanger sequencing, we detected no mutation in any of the regions we examined ( Figure S4 C). We next determined male fertility from these knockin strains by crossing them with wild-type females and found that mice with single mutations ( P1 S9A or P1 S43A ) were largely fertile, comparable to wild-type, but the fertility of double P1 S9S43A mutant mice was severely compromised, as indicated by the drastic reduction in litter size ( Figure 4 B). This phenotype correlated to the developmental potential of eggs fertilized by sperm of different genotypes: only a small fraction (∼17%) of eggs fertilized by double mutant sperm was able to progress to the 2-cell stage 18 h post-IVF, which was in sharp contrast to the majority (∼80%) of eggs fertilized with both single mutants, although we observed a slight reduction in both cases compared to wild-type sperm ( Figure 4 C).
To further differentiate the contribution of P1 phosphorylation defects to male infertility during spermiogenesis and/or zygotic development, we examined sperm counts from mutant males and found normal sperm count from both wild-type and single mutant males, but a slight reduction in sperm count from double mutant males ( Figure S4 D). To examine DNA compaction in double mutant sperm, we employed aniline blue staining ( Gou et al., 2017 19. Gou, L.T. ∙ Kang, J.Y. ∙ Dai, P. ... Ubiquitination-Deficient Mutations in Human Piwi Cause Male Infertility by Impairing Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis Cell. 2017; 169 :1090-1104 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that mutant sperm were similar to wild-type sperm, both not efficiently stained with aniline blue ( Figure S4 E). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further revealed well-condensed sperm head/nucleus in both wild-type and double mutant epididymal sections ( Figure S4 F). These data strongly suggest appropriately compacted sperm genome from double mutant males.
To directly demonstrate that the functional defects largely resulted from defects in zygotic development, likely due to failed protamine-to-histone exchange in fertilized eggs, we performed immunostaining of fertilized egg 1 h post-IVF with our phospho-specific antibodies. We detected P1 phosphorylation at Ser43, but not Ser9, on Ser9-mutated paternal genome; conversely, P1 phosphorylation at Ser9, but not Ser43, in Ser43-mutated paternal genome; and negative staining with both antibodies on double mutant-fertilized eggs ( Figures 4 D and 4E). As P1 still remained associated with paternal chromatin at this stage, we next examined zygotes 4 h post-IVF and found that P1 was dismissed in eggs fertilized with wild-type or single mutant sperm, but remained on paternal chromatin in eggs fertilized with double mutant sperm ( Figure 4 F). Quantitative analysis further showed that the immunostaining signals of P1 were inversely correlated with the sizes of the paternal pronucleus ( Figures 4 G and 4H). As double mutant-fertilized eggs were literally blocked at the 1-cell stage (see Figure 4 C), we conclude that SRPK1-catalyzed phosphorylation is required for protamine removal, which is a prerequisite for paternal genome decondensation in the fertilized egg and subsequent zygotic development.
Because the Arg-rich domain in a SR-like splicing factor (U2AF65) has been implicated in promoting RNA-RNA interactions during spliceosome assembly ( Valcárcel et al., 1996 60. Valcárcel, J. ∙ Gaur, R.K. ∙ Singh, R. ... Interaction of U2AF65 RS region with pre-mRNA branch point and promotion of base pairing with U2 snRNA [corrected] Science. 1996; 273 :1706-1709 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ), we asked how the interaction of P1 with DNA might be modulated by SRPK1-catalyzed phosphorylation. We thus performed the gel mobility shift assay to determine how P1 might bind DNA, and as expected, P1 bound double-stranded DNA in a dosage-dependent manner, and in the presence of active SRPK1, the affinity was only slightly reduced ( Figure S5 A). During this analysis, we noted that the P1/DNA complex hardly entered the gel, indicating a DNA-dependent phase transition, consistent with a predicted intrinsically disordered region in P1 ( Figure 5 A). To pursue this intriguing property of P1, we incubated P1 with genomic DNA and observed the formation of turbid solution with increasing P1 concentrations, even without the need to reduce temperature or include a crowding reagent ( Figure S5 B). Visualizing this turbid material under a microscope revealed small particles with low P1 concentrations and large mesh-like networks with higher P1 concentrations ( Figure 5 B). Interestingly, these different degrees of aggregation were independent of DNA length, indicating that such mesh-like structures were not due to smaller particles arrayed on the DNA string ( Figure S5 C). By spiking in a small fraction of fluorescence-labeled P1 or DNA in the reaction, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and found that neither P1 nor DNA fluorescence could be recovered within the time frame of the experiment ( Figure 5 C), indicating the formation of a gel-like structure. We suspect that this DNA-induced phase separation might be related to DNA packaging into the sperm head in late spermiogenesis.
We next asked how SRPK1-catalyzed P1 phosphorylation might affect such phase transition. We first tested incubation of P1 with genomic DNA in a buffer we used for the in vitro kinase reaction and observed mesh-like structures ( Figure 5 D). Note that our buffer contains DTT, which would prevent the formation of intra- and inter-steric disulfide bonds in protamine molecules, suggesting that the mesh-like structure is not mediated by crosslinking between protamine-containing particles. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min with active SRPK1 (conditions that allow efficient P1 phosphorylation), but not kinase-dead SRPK1, we detected only gel-like particles, not mesh-like networks ( Figure 5 D). We next tested single and double phosphorylation mutant P1 and found that both single mutants behaved similar to wild-type P1 in an active SRPK1-dependent manner ( Figures S5 D and S5E) and only the double mutant was able to transit to mesh-like networks even in the presence of active SRPK1 ( Figure 5 E). Together, these results suggest that small gel-like particles may form through some form of stacking interactions among P1/DNA complexes, which is independent of the phosphorylation state of P1, while the transition to mesh-like networks is blocked by P1 phosphorylation. This suggests that SRPK1-mediated P1 phosphorylation may facilitate opening of the highly compacted paternal genome for specific chaperones to act upon, rather than directly causing protamine dismissal.
Previous studies have reported that purified NPM2 was sufficient to induce protamine removal from sperm after removing its membrane with streptolysin O (SLO) and disruption of disulfide bonds with DTT ( Inoue et al., 2011; Shintomi et al., 2015, 2017; Yamaguchi et al., 2018 26. Inoue, A. ∙ Ogushi, S. ∙ Saitou, M. ... Involvement of mouse nucleoplasmin 2 in the decondensation of sperm chromatin after fertilization Biol.

Re-evaluating the Localization of Sperm-Retained Histones Revealed the Modification-Dependent Accumulation in Specific Genome Regions Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :3920-3932 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this assay normally takes 2 to 24 h to observe detectable effects, indicating that purified NPM2 may be sufficient to slowly extract protamine from DNA during prolonged incubation. Following the same protocol ( Figure S6 A), we repeated the assay with purified recombinant human NPM2 ( Figure S6 B) and observed partial sperm decondensation from 1 to 2 h ( Figure S6 C). Under the same conditions, we tested the effect of SRPK1 and found that, while purified SRPK1 alone is insufficient to decondense the sperm genome ( Figure S6 D), SRPK1 treatment greatly accelerated NPM2-mediated sperm decondensation as early as 15 min, while the kinase-dead SRPK1 failed to show this effect ( Figure 6 A, top panel). These observations are well in line with slow paternal DNA decondensation, as seen in SRPK1-depleted oocytes ∼10 h post-IVF ( Figure S6 E). We also tested sperm from double mutant males, and as expected, those double mutant sperm no longer responded to SRPK1 in accelerating NPM2-mediated sperm chromatin decondensation ( Figure 6 A, bottom panel), again in line with slow decondensation of double mutant paternal chromatin in the presence of maternal SRPK1 ( Figure S6 F). We tested and detected no effect of purified NPM2 in the absence or presence of active SRPK1 on in vitro assembled P1/DNA gel-like particles ( Figure S6 G), indicating that NPM2 may not be able to fully strip off protamines from the paternal genome.
Because chromatin decondensation may reflect loosen structures, not necessarily protamine removal, we next wished to directly evaluate P1 that remained on sperm chromatin by western blotting and ask whether P1 removal might be induced by SRPK1-catalyzed phosphorylation. We first incubated SLO/DTT-pretreated sperm with SRPK1 for 30 min and then proceeded with the DNA decondensation assay. We found that SRPK1 phosphorylated P1 at Ser9 and Ser43, and importantly, while NPM2 alone slowly removed chromatin-bound P1, SRPK1 greatly enhanced NPM2-dependent P1 removal, and as expected, the double mutant P1 no longer responded to SRPK1 treatment ( Figure 6 B). We next asked how SRPK1 might affect the interaction between P1 and NPM2 by using HA-tagged NPM2 purified from HEK293T cells to pull down wild-type and mutant P1 with or without SRPK1. We found that HA-NPM2 was able to bind P1, which was enhanced by SRPK1-mediated phosphorylation on wild-type and single mutants, but not double mutant ( Figure 6 C). These data suggest a mechanism for SRPK1-enhanced, NPM2-mediated protamine removal from sperm chromatin.
It has been well established that the histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA is selectively recruited to the paternal pronucleus for chromatin remodeling ( Inoue and Zhang, 2014; Lin et al., 2014 25. Inoue, A. ∙ Zhang, Y. Nucleosome assembly is required for nuclear pore complex assembly in mouse zygotes Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :609-616 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Lin, C.J. ∙ Koh, F.M. ∙ Wong, P. ... Hira-mediated H3.3 incorporation is required for DNA replication and ribosomal RNA transcription in the mouse zygote Dev. Cell. 2014; 30 :268-279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it has been unclear how such selectivity is achieved and how HIRA recruitment to the paternal genome may be regulated in the fertilized egg. We hypothesized that SRPK1-mediated protamine phosphorylation might facilitate coordinated protamine removal and histone H3.3 deposition. To test this hypothesis, we again took advantage of single and double P1 mutant sperm to perform IVF and stained for H3.3 and HIRA 1.5 h post-IVF. Interestingly, we detected efficient HIRA recruitment to and H3.3 deposition on the paternal pronucleus with wild-type and single P1 mutant sperm, but little HIRA signal on the double mutant paternal chromatin ( Figure 6 D). Thus, HIRA recruitment to the paternal genome appears to be largely mediated by phosphorylated P1. The similar timing (1 to 1.5 h) between P1 removal and H3.3 deposition suggests that the two processes are synchronous and occur shortly after fertilization.
To determine whether HIRA recruitment was directly mediated by protamine in a SRPK1 phosphorylation-dependent manner, we performed the in vitro pull down assay in the presence or absence of active SRPK1 using purified HA-tagged HIRA from HEK293T cells. We found that HIRA bound wild-type P1 in a strictly SRPK1-dependent manner ( Figure 6 E). Both single mutant P1s reduced the efficiency whereas the double mutant P1 abolished the interaction with HIRA ( Figure 6 E). These data are fully in line with the in vivo recruitment results, together, suggesting that SRPK1-catalyzed protamine phosphorylation also facilitates the selective recruitment of HIRA to the paternal genome to coordinate with the function of NPM proteins during paternal genome reprogramming.
It is striking to note that the defect in male fertility caused by the double mutant P1 is more severe than that caused by deleting any of the factors implicated in protamine-to-histone exchange reported to date, indicating that SRPK1-catalyzed protamine phosphorylation is the first step to potentiate the action of various chaperones. Given that all potential chaperones are present in the MII oocytes and the ability of purified NPM2 to slowly decondense sperm in vitro , we wondered whether paternal DNA still underwent partial decondensation without P1 phosphorylation, thus altering the accessibility of sperm chromatin that could be captured by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq). We thus characterized the chromatin state of parental genomes by performing low input ATAC-seq (with ∼100 fertilized eggs), as established earlier ( Wu et al., 2016 66. Wu, J. ∙ Huang, B. ∙ Chen, H. ... The landscape of accessible chromatin in mammalian preimplantation embryos Nature. 2016; 534 :652-657 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ), to capture early genome reprogramming events ∼5 h post-IVF, which corresponds to late pronucleus (PN) stage 2 and early stage 3 ( Wossidlo et al., 2010 64. Wossidlo, M. ∙ Arand, J. ∙ Sebastiano, V. ... Dynamic link of DNA demethylation, DNA strand breaks and repair in mouse zygotes EMBO J. 2010; 29 :1877-1888 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ), a developmental window too early to physically isolate paternal and maternal pronuclei for genomic profiling. In order to differentiate between paternal and maternal genomes, we took advantage of extensive (∼20 million) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ mice ( Link et al., 2018 40. Link, V.M. ∙ Duttke, S.H. ∙ Chun, H.B. ... Analysis of Genetically Diverse Macrophages Reveals Local and Domain-wide Mechanisms that Control Transcription Factor Binding and Function Cell. 2018; 173 :1796-1809 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). As our P1 knockin mice were constructed in the C57BL/6 strain, we utilized sperm from this strain to fertilize MII oocytes from the BALB/cJ strain ( Figure 7 A).
We performed ATAC-seq in duplicate and obtained 10–28 million uniquely mapped reads to the mouse genome from individual libraries ( Figure S7 A). The ATAC-seq data were of high quality, as indicated by high reproducibility between individual duplicates from fertilized eggs ( Figure S7 B) as well as between wild-type and different mutant sperm in comparison with the public sperm ATAC-seq data ( Jung et al., 2017 30. Jung, Y.H. ∙ Sauria, M.E.G. ∙ Lyu, X. ... Chromatin States in Mouse Sperm Correlate with Embryonic and Adult Regulatory Landscapes Cell Rep. 2017; 18 :1366-1382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 C). Surprisingly, despite similar read densities, we detected broadly distributed ATAC-seq reads across the mouse genome even before deconvoluting the reads to paternal and maternal gametes formed with wild-type and single mutant sperm, and in contrast, we saw individual peaks with zygotes formed with the double mutant sperm, as illustrated on a representative genomic region ( Figure 7 B, layer I). Treatment with siSRPK1, but not control siRNA, caused similar effects ( Figure 7 B). We next assigned ATAC-seq reads to the paternal versus maternal genome based on SNPs, as reported earlier ( Link et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2012 40. Link, V.M. ∙ Duttke, S.H. ∙ Chun, H.B. ... Analysis of Genetically Diverse Macrophages Reveals Local and Domain-wide Mechanisms that Control Transcription Factor Binding and Function Cell. 2018; 173 :1796-1809 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Xie, W. ∙ Barr, C.L. ∙ Kim, A. ... Base-resolution analyses of sequence and parent-of-origin dependent DNA methylation in the mouse genome Cell. 2012; 148 :816-831 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar ). From a total of 478,021 and 110,608 SNP-containing reads mapped to the maternal and paternal genome, respectively, cross-genome analysis showed little cross-genome assignment ( Figures S7 D and S7E). This is also the case with both single and double mutant ATAC-seq data ( Figure S7 D). We noted that, while 81.2% of SNP-containing reads were assigned to the maternal genome, 18.8% of SNP-containing reads were assignable to the paternal genome in eggs fertilized by wild-type sperm, which progressively decreased with single and double mutants (14.2%, 10.8%, 8.0%) ( Figure S7 F). This likely reflects more compaction of the paternal genome compared to the maternal genome.
After deconvoluting paternal and maternal ATAC-seq reads and normalizing all libraries to an equal density (counts per million [CPM]), we found that only the double mutant showed significant ATAC-seq peaks ( Figure 7 B, layer II), despite much reduced read density even among top 10,000 ATAC-seq reads-containing genomic bins ( Figure S7 G). This was also the case with the ATAC-seq reads uniquely mapped to the maternal genome ( Figure 7 B, layer III). Using the same data treatment strategy to focus on SNP-containing ATAC-seq reads, we found that wild-type, single, and double mutant sperm all showed similar ATAC-seq peak distributions, which also resembled the published ATAC-seq profile on wild-type sperm ( Figure 7 B, layer IV), indicating that the paternal genome was similarly packaged during spermiogenesis. Aligning on these sperm ATAC-seq peak centers, we found that the paternal genome in eggs fertilized with the double mutant sperm largely retained sperm-specific ATAC-seq peaks ( Figure 7 C), which were also overlapped with the published H3.3 ChIP-seq signals on wild-type sperm ( Figure S7 H), mostly corresponding to transcription start sites (TSSs) ( Figure S7 I). We noted that the background for ATAC-seq signals on isolated sperm was much higher than that in eggs fertilized with the double mutant sperm, as indicated by the lower Z score scale with the ATAC-seq signals from sperm compared to fertilized eggs, which is likely due to the more compacted paternal genome in sperm relative to fertilized egg where extensive inter-protamine disulfide bonds are likely removed.
Strikingly, the ATAC-seq peaks on the maternal genome from eggs fertilized with the double mutant P1 sperm also largely resembled those in the MII oocyte ( Jung et al., 2019 31. Jung, Y.H. ∙ Kremsky, I. ∙ Gold, H.B. ... Maintenance of CTCF- and Transcription Factor-Mediated Interactions from the Gametes to the Early Mouse Embryo Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :154-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ), despite the ability of the double mutant-fertilized oocyte to form the maternal pronucleus (indicative of unaffected progression of fertilized MII oocyte beyond metaphase), which is in sharp contrast to vanished ATAC-seq peaks on the maternal genome in eggs fertilized with wild-type and single mutant P1 sperm ( Figure 7 D). Note that this comparison was made with the normalized data using the same scale. This might explain the inability to detect ATAC-seq peaks at the 1-cell stage, which was thought to result from “failed” ATAC-seq profiling experiments in a previous report ( Wu et al., 2016 66. Wu, J. ∙ Huang, B. ∙ Chen, H. ... The landscape of accessible chromatin in mammalian preimplantation embryos Nature. 2016; 534 :652-657 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ). siSRPK1 treatment mirrored the effects of the double mutant P1 sperm on both paternal and maternal genome reprogramming ( Figures 7 B–7D). Based on these data, we draw two important conclusions: (1) dramatic chromatin remodeling takes place in a highly coordinated fashion in both paternal and maternal pronuclei before they merge, and (2) SRPK1-catalyzed protamine phosphorylation initiates such synchronized parental genome reprogramming.

Section: Discussion

Based on the evidence presented in this study, we propose a model for a cascade of events in chromatin remodeling shortly after fertilization ( Figure 7 E). The highly compacted sperm DNA first needs to be opened up by removing inter-protamine disulfide bonds ( Emelyanov and Fyodorov, 2016 16. Emelyanov, A.V. ∙ Fyodorov, D.V. Thioredoxin-dependent disulfide bond reduction is required for protamine eviction from sperm chromatin Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :2651-2656 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), which exposes protamines for phosphorylation by SRPK1. Protamine phosphorylation may weaken interactions between protamine molecules, as reflected by the reduction of large aggregates to smaller condensates in the presence of SRPK1, and subsequently promote their interactions with various chaperones to mediate the protamine-to-histone exchange on the paternal genome. Importantly, this process appears to be highly synchronized with chromatin remodeling in the maternal genome before fusion of the two gametes.
The superfamily of SR proteins is characterized by a domain(s) containing multiple Arg/Ser dipeptides (RS domain) flanked by one or two RNA binding domains, which primarily function in constitutive and regulated pre-mRNA splicing ( Fu, 1995 17. Fu, X.D. The superfamily of arginine/serine-rich splicing factors RNA. 1995; 1 :663-680 PubMed Google Scholar ). All RS domain-containing proteins studied to date are specially recognized by SR protein-specific kinases (SRPKs) to promote their nuclear import, protein-protein interactions, and protein-RNA interactions to facilitate spliceosome assembly ( Zhou and Fu, 2013 75. Zhou, Z. ∙ Fu, X.D. Regulation of splicing by SR proteins and SR protein-specific kinases Chromosoma. 2013; 122 :191-207 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). SRPKs specifically require Arg to catalyze Ser phosphorylation in RS domains ( Gui et al., 1994b 22. Gui, J.F. ∙ Tronchère, H. ∙ Chandler, S.D. ... Purification and characterization of a kinase specific for the serine- and arginine-rich pre-mRNA splicing factors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91 :10824-10828 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both P1 and P2 contain several RS dipeptides and P1 has been shown to be an excellent substrate for SRPK1 in the in vitro kinase reaction ( Papoutsopoulou et al., 1999 48. Papoutsopoulou, S. ∙ Nikolakaki, E. ∙ Chalepakis, G. ... SR protein-specific kinase 1 is highly expressed in testis and phosphorylates protamine 1 Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27 :2972-2980 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, given the fact that various basic proteins, such as histone H1, often serve as surrogate substrates for kinases, it is our current work that demonstrates that SRPK1-catalyzed protamine phosphorylation is a critical physiological event in early embryonic development. Protamines may thus be considered new members of the SR superfamily of proteins.
Interestingly, SRPK1 is conserved from budding yeast to humans and protamine is also highly conversed among vertebrates, suggesting that protamine and SRPK1-catalyzed protamine phosphorylation may be a universal mechanism for facilitating protamine-to-histone exchange within fertilized eggs in animal kingdom. As a matter of fact, SR proteins have been implicated in multiple cellular activities beyond RNA processing from transcription to RNA export to translational control ( Zhong et al., 2009 73. Zhong, X.Y. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Han, J. ... SR proteins in vertical integration of gene expression from transcription to RNA processing to translation Mol. Cell. 2009; 35 :1-10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our current finding of SRPK1-facilitated chromatin remodeling on the paternal genome points to a potential function of SRPKs at the chromatin level in somatic cells by modulating the regulatory activities of classic SR proteins on chromatin during transcription ( Ji et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2008; Mo et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2019 29.

SRPK1 is highly expressed in testis and oocyte, consistent with its vital roles in both spermiogenesis and preimplantation development of fertilized egg. It is interesting to note that a S56A mutation in P2 has been reported to bypass the requirement for a phosphatase regulator (Hspa4I) to produce functional sperm during spermiogenesis ( Itoh et al., 2019 28. Itoh, K. ∙ Kondoh, G. ∙ Miyachi, H. ... Dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 is crucial for murine sperm maturation in vivo Sci. Signal. 2019; 12 :eaao7232 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is well known that histones are sequentially replaced by transition proteins and then by protamines in spermatids ( Oliva, 2006 47. Oliva, R. Protamines and male infertility Hum. Reprod. Update. 2006; 12 :417-435 Crossref Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that SRPK1-catalyzed protamine phosphorylation may ensure such sequential packaging of the paternal DNA. However, protamine has to be largely dephosphorylated in the final stage of spermiogenesis, consistent with the lack of immunostaining signals on isolated wild-type sperm with our phospho-specific antibodies, which may enable DNA-dependent phase transition, as we now observed in vitro . According to this likely scenario, we predict that hyper-phosphorylation of protamine, such as those mimicked by Ser-to-Asp mutations in SRPK1 phosphorylation sites, may prevent the production of functional sperm during spermatogenesis, a hypothesis we are actively pursuing.
If dephosphorylation is required for histone-to-protamine exchange in spermatids, our current work demonstrates that this process is potently reversed by SRPK1-catalyzed phosphorylation shortly after fertilization to initiate paternal genome reprogramming. This process requires a dual phosphorylation event in P1. Interestingly, we note that the N terminus of P1 contains 3 potential phosphorylation sites, only one of which (Ser9) is phosphorylated. Importantly, this phosphorylation site is highly conserved in vertebrates, and in contrast, the C-terminal phosphorylation site (Ser43) is present only in a subset of mammals, but not in humans. We show that phosphorylation at either one of these two sites in mouse P1 is sufficient for promoting the protamine-to-histone exchange. Thus, in the absence of a C-terminal site, the conserved N-terminal phosphorylation site may provide the regulatory function in most species.
It is important to point out that a small number of eggs fertilized by double mutant P1 sperm were still able to develop into 2-cell embryos, which is consistent with the observation that P1 S9S43A males could occasionally give live birth. This phenotype likely results from SRPK1-catalyzed P2 phosphorylation and/or the ability of NPM2 to slowly extract protamine from sperm, thus enabling some double mutant sperm to eventually make it through the process.
The protamine-to-histone exchange may be a much more complex process than it appears. In the literature, NPM2 has been thought to play a major role in extracting protamine from sperm DNA, but the paternal genome still undergoes efficient decondensation in fertilized oocytes of NPM2 KO mice ( Burns et al., 2003 8. Burns, K.H. ∙ Viveiros, M.M. ∙ Ren, Y. ... Roles of NPM2 in chromatin and nucleolar organization in oocytes and embryos Science. 2003; 300 :633-636 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is likely due to related functions of NPM1 and NPM3 ( Okuwaki et al., 2012 46. Okuwaki, M. ∙ Sumi, A. ∙ Hisaoka, M. ... Function of homo- and hetero-oligomers of human nucleoplasmin/nucleophosmin family proteins NPM1, NPM2 and NPM3 during sperm chromatin remodeling Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :4861-4878 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) and/or TAF1β ( Matsumoto et al., 1999 43. Matsumoto, K. ∙ Nagata, K. ∙ Miyaji-Yamaguchi, M. ... Sperm chromatin decondensation by template activating factor I through direct interaction with basic proteins Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 :6940-6952 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, the histone chaperone HIRA is responsible for deposing the histone 3 variant H3.3 onto paternal DNA, but this process does not have to be coupled with protamine dismissal, as sperm DNA still undergoes efficient decondensation in HIRA-depleted oocytes ( Inoue and Zhang, 2014; Lin et al., 2014 25. Inoue, A. ∙ Zhang, Y. Nucleosome assembly is required for nuclear pore complex assembly in mouse zygotes Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :609-616 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Lin, C.J. ∙ Koh, F.M. ∙ Wong, P. ... Hira-mediated H3.3 incorporation is required for DNA replication and ribosomal RNA transcription in the mouse zygote Dev. Cell. 2014; 30 :268-279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, while purified NPM2 is sufficient to drive protamine removal from sperm chromatin, which is accelerated by SRPK1-catalyzed protamine phosphorylation, we were unable to detect this effect on in vitro assembled P1/DNA particles. This suggests that the P1/DNA condensates may simply be in vitro artifacts, and thus, do not reassemble the conformation of native sperm chromatin. A more interesting alternative scenario is that NPM2 may initiate protamine removal on chromatin regions that harbor retained H3.3 residues, rather than randomly from anywhere. As H3.3 bound chromatin regions correspond to ATAC-seq peaks, suggesting that those accessible regions might provide docking sites for NPM2 to act on, given the ability of NPM2 to interact with both protamines and histones ( Ellard et al., 2016 15. Ellard, K. ∙ Serpa, J.J. ∙ Petrotchenko, E.V. ... Expression and purification of the full murine NPM2 and study of its interaction with protamines and histones Biochem. Biophys. Rep. 2016; 6 :165-171 PubMed Google Scholar ). As H3.3 is entirely missing from the in vitro assembled P1/DNA particles, NPM2 may not be accessible to these particles even in the presence of SRPK1. Therefore, as illustrated in Figure 7 E, we propose a working model where NPMs may begin to extract protamine from H3.3-containing regions, thus emphasizing a functional requirement for a small fraction of retained histone. SRPK1 not only enhances the interaction of NPMs with sperm chromatin but also enables phosphorylated protamine to recruit HIRA to deposit H3.3 onto vacated DNA regions. This process may thus be orchestrated to drive protamine-to-histone exchange in a coordinated fashion.
One of the most striking findings presented in this work is the coordinated reprogramming between paternal and maternal genomes upon fertilization even though both gametes’ genomes still reside in separate pronuclei. Recent genomic profiling for chromatin state by DNase I hypersensitivity assay ( Lu et al., 2016 42. Lu, F. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Inoue, A. ... Establishing Chromatin Regulatory Landscape during Mouse Preimplantation Development Cell. 2016; 165 :1375-1388 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ATAC-seq ( Wu et al., 2016 66. Wu, J. ∙ Huang, B. ∙ Chen, H. ... The landscape of accessible chromatin in mammalian preimplantation embryos Nature. 2016; 534 :652-657 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed a gradual gain of chromatin accessibility during pre-implantation zygotic development, which is associated with progressive formation of topologically associating domains (TADs) ( Du et al., 2017 14. Du, Z. ∙ Zheng, H. ∙ Huang, B. ... Allelic reprogramming of 3D chromatin architecture during early mammalian development Nature. 2017; 547 :232-235 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ) and redistribution of the chromatin mark H3K4me3 ( Dahl et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016 12. Dahl, J.A. ∙ Jung, I. ∙ Aanes, H. ... Broad histone H3K4me3 domains in mouse oocytes modulate maternal-to-zygotic transition Nature. 2016; 537 :548-552 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Zhang, B. ∙ Zheng, H. ∙ Huang, B. ... Allelic reprogramming of the histone modification H3K4me3 in early mammalian development Nature. 2016; 537 :553-557 Crossref Scopus (464) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, although the paternal DNA is predominantly packed with protamine whereas the maternal genome still with histones, both genomes show extensively overlapped ATAC-seq peaks, predominantly at TSSs ( Jung et al., 2019 31. Jung, Y.H. ∙ Kremsky, I. ∙ Gold, H.B. ... Maintenance of CTCF- and Transcription Factor-Mediated Interactions from the Gametes to the Early Mouse Embryo Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :154-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that both genomes are poised for activation.
Because PN3 is the earliest stage profiled prior to our work, it remains unclear whether the detected DNase-seq peaks at the PN3 stage are those inherited from sperm and MII oocyte or newly established after fertilization. By performing ATAC-seq profiling right after fertilization between late PN2 and early PN3 stages, we unexpectedly found that both paternal and maternal genomes simultaneously lost ATAC-seq peaks, indicating that both parental genomes undergo a rather complete reprogramming after fertilization. Importantly, by using the double mutant P1 sperm or in response to SRPK1 depletion, we found that ATAC-seq peaks on both paternal and maternal genomes remained, indicative of dynamic chromatin remodeling in both genomes. The sperm-induced maternal genome reprogramming might be related to a curious phenomenon, called hybridogenesis, where fertilization occurs with the sperm from a closely related species, but the paternal DNA is not passed on to the developing embryo, as seen in various frogs and salamander species ( Lavanchy and Schwander, 2019 33. Lavanchy, G. ∙ Schwander, T. Hybridogenesis Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :R9-R11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that the incoming sperm may provide a signal to activate the maternal genome. Our current findings have thus laid a foundation for future studies to understand how the paternal genome communicates with the maternal genome in fertilized egg.

Both decreased and increased SRPK1 levels promote cancer by interfering with PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) and control mice at 3-4 weeks of age were used in this study. P1 S9A/+ , P1 S43A/+ , and P1 S9S43A/+ knock-in mice were generated by using a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing approach ( Paquet et al., 2016 49. Paquet, D. ∙ Kwart, D. ∙ Chen, A. ... Efficient introduction of specific homozygous and heterozygous mutations using CRISPR/Cas9 Nature. 2016; 533 :125-129 Crossref Scopus (667) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, chemically synthesized tracrRNA, crRNA, and single-stranded donor oligonucleotides were co-injected with Cas9 protein (NEB) into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs by the UCSD Transgenic Mouse Core. After in vitro culture for 2 hours, embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant ICR females. Offspring genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to PCR and Sanger sequencing for genotyping. Potential off-target sites were selected according to CRISPR Design ( http://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources ) and PCR-amplified for sequencing. Male P1 knock-in and control mice at 10-12 weeks of age were used in these analyses. All mouse models were generated in the C57BL/6 background.
All animal work was performed under the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), with protocols (S99116) approved by University of California San Diego, consistent with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 1996 (institutional animal welfare assurance no. A-3125-01).
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against P1 phosphorylation at Ser9, Ser11, Ser13, and Ser43 were generated by immunizing rabbits with chemically synthesized P1 peptides with phosphorylation (P9: MARYRCCRSpKSRSRCR; P11: MARYRCCRSKSpRSRCR; P13: YRCCRSKSRSpRCRRRRR; P43: RCCRRRRSpYTIRCKKY; Figure S3 E), followed by affinity purification with antigens. Other antibodies used are provided in the Key Resources Table .
IVF was performed as described ( Sztein et al., 2000 59. Sztein, J.M. ∙ Farley, J.S. ∙ Mobraaten, L.E. In vitro fertilization with cryopreserved inbred mouse sperm Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63 :1774-1780 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, sperm were collected from caudal epididymides of 8 to 12-week old male C57BL/6 mice and then capacitated for 1 hour in human tubal fluid (HTF) medium (Millipore) at 37°C in 5% CO 2 incubator. Sperm were incubated with intact cumulus-oocyte complexes or MII oocytes for 1 to 4 hours. After removing excess sperm and cumulus lysate, presumptive fertilized eggs were transferred to KSOM medium (Millipore) for further culture and analysis.
For inhibitor treatment, isolated cumulus-oocyte complexes were incubated with M2 medium (Millipore) containing Hyaluronidase (Millipore) to release MII oocytes. After washing, the oocytes were transferred to HTF medium (Millipore) containing SRPKIN-1 or JH-VII-206-2 ( Hatcher et al., 2018 24. Hatcher, J.M. ∙ Wu, G. ∙ Zeng, C. ... SRPKIN-1: A Covalent SRPK1/2 Inhibitor that Potently Converts VEGF from Pro-angiogenic to Anti-angiogenic Isoform Cell Chem. Biol. 2018; 25 :460-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ) suspended in DMSO at indicated concentrations for 1 hour before insemination.
Injection and culture of growing oocytes were performed according to Inoue et al., 2014; Inoue and Zhang, 2014. Specifically, oocyte-granulosa cell complexes were isolated from ovaries of 12-day old C57BL/6 female mice and transferred into α-MEM with GlutaMax (Life Technologies, 32571-036) containing 5% FBS, 100 IU/L PMSG, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich). After 1-hour incubation, the complexes were switched to M2 medium (Millipore) for microinjection. 5∼10 pL siSRPK1 (20 μM) or control siRNA (both from Dharmacon) was injected into the cytoplasm of growing oocytes with Femtojet (Eppendorf), evident by movement of cytoplasmic granules within the oocyte. For rescue experiments, 100 ng/μl of T7 in vitro transcribed human SRPK1 mRNA was co-injected with mouse siSRPK1. After microinjection, oocytes were transferred to M2 medium containing 2% PVP (MW 360,000, Sigma-Aldrich). Medium was changed every other day (Figure S2). After 12-day in vitro culture, fully grown oocytes surrounded by cumulus cells were transferred to α-MEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 10 ng/ml EGF for meiotic maturation overnight. MII oocytes were transferred to HTF medium (Millipore) and inseminated with capacitated sperm. To detect H3.3 deposition during maternal chromatin remodeling, isolated MII oocytes were injected with 100 ng/μl Flag-H3.3 mRNA T7 in vitro transcribed from linearized pcDNA3.1-Flag-H3.3 construct and purified by lithium chloride precipitation followed by suspension in nuclease-free water.
Zygotes were washed with M2 medium (Millipore) and treated with acidic Tyrode’s solution (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove zona pellucida. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature (for protamine staining, sperm or zygotes were additionally treated with Tris-HCl pH 9.5 and 25 mM DTT for 10 min after permeabilization), samples were washed in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hour, and incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C: mouse anti- SRPK1 (1:500, BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-SRPK1 (1:100, ABclonal), mouse anti-SRPK2 (1:250, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-protamine 1 (1:100, Briar Patch Biosciences), goat anti-protamine 1 (1:50, Santa Cruz), rabbit antisera against phosphorylated protamine 1 (1:100, custom raised in this study), mouse anti-HIRA (1:100, Active Motif), rabbit anti-Flag (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.1% BSA, samples were incubated with second antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa 594 or Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes) for 1 hour at room temperature, washed and stained with DAPI for 5 min. After an additional wash with PBS, Fluoromount-G mounting media (SouthernBiotech) was applied onto glass slides. Images were acquired with Olympus microscope. Staining signal intensity and pronuclear size were quantified by using ImageJ (NIH). For SRPK1 intensity quantification, all the examined zygotes showed a Mean Intensity distribution from 10 to 60, the zygotes were divided into 3 categories based on their Mean Intensity (Negative: 10∼25; Intermediate: 25∼45; Positive: 45∼60).
Aniline blue staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to determine the chromatin compaction of sperm nuclei ( Gou et al., 2017 19. Gou, L.T. ∙ Kang, J.Y. ∙ Dai, P. ... Ubiquitination-Deficient Mutations in Human Piwi Cause Male Infertility by Impairing Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis Cell. 2017; 169 :1090-1104 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, sperm from cauda epididymis were harvested, spread on slides and air-dried. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min and washed with PBS, then treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Slides were stained using acidic aniline blue staining (5% methyl blue in 100 mL 4% acetic acid, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min. TEM was performed at the UCSD EM core: cauda epididymis sections were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.15M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and then fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. Dehydration was carried out in ethanol and the samples were embedded in Durcupan. Ultrathin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and images were captured on JEOL 1400 plus TEM at 80KV with Gatan 4k × 4k camera.
Wild-type and kinase-dead SRPK1 were expressed from the pRSETb vector containing a 6 × HisTag at the N terminus and purified ( Aubol et al., 2012 2. Aubol, B.E. ∙ Plocinik, R.M. ∙ McGlone, M.L. ... Nucleotide release sequences in the protein kinase SRPK1 accelerate substrate phosphorylation Biochemistry. 2012; 51 :6584-6594 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Protamine phosphorylation ( Table S1 ) with 10 μM purified SRPK1 in vitro was carried out in reaction buffer (100 mM Mops-pH 7.4, 2 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl, and 50 μM 32 P-ATP) at 37°C for 1 hour. All reactions were carried out in a total reaction volume of 10 μL and then were quenched with 90 μL 30% Acetic Acid. Phosphorylated protamine (50 μL) was separated from unreacted 32 P-ATP by spotting onto a charged paper filter dish (Whatman grade P81), gently washed three times with 0.5% o-phosphoric acid (Fisher Scientific), rinsed with acetone, dried, and counted on the 32 P channel in liquid scintillation counter. The total amount of phosphate incorporated into the substrate was determined by considering the specific activity (cpm/min) of the reaction mixture and the background retention of 32 P-ATP in the absence of SRPK1.
Mouse testis genomic DNA (ZYAGEN) was labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 using ULYSIS Nucleic Acid Labeling Kits (Molecular Probes), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Specifically, 1 μg of sperm DNA was incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 in labeling buffer (5 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) for 15 min at 80°C without a denaturation step. Labeled sperm DNA was purified using Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Gel column (Bio-Rad). 25nt and 50nt Cy3-labeled and non-labeled DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies), and 100nt Cy3-labeled DNA oligonucleotide (Sigma-Aldrich) were chemically synthesized ( Table S2 ). To generate double-strand DNA, sense and antisense single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide were annealed for 5 min at 95°C in annealing buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 and 50 mM NaCl) followed by ramping down from 95°C to 25°C at 0.1C/sec.
Protamine peptides were fluorescently labeled using Atto 488 Protein Labeling Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Specifically, 0.35 μg of chemically synthesized peptide was incubated with Atto 488 reactive dye in sodium bicarbonate buffer for 5 hours at 4°C. During the reaction, the mixture was gently rotated and shielded from light. Excess dye was removed by multiple rounds of washing with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) with the 3K Amicon Centrifugal Filter (Millipore).
Phase separation of Protamine 1 (10% Atto 488-labeled) with sperm DNA (1% Alexa Fluor 594-labeled) or DNA in different lengths (1% Cy3-labeled) was performed in phase separation buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 and 75 mM NaCl). After incubation for 10 min, gel-like particles were imaged under Olympus microscope. For SRPK1 treatment, gel-like particles were generated by mixing 50 μM of Protamine 1 (10% Atto 488-labeled) and 350 ng/μl of sperm DNA (1% Alexa Fluor 594-labeled) in buffer (2 mM DTT, 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 μM ATP, and 30 mM NaCl). After incubation for 5 min, 10 μM wild-type or kinase-dead SRPK1 was added to the mixture followed by further incubation for 30 min at 37°C.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed on Olympus microscope equipped with 488 nm laser. Photobleaching was performed for 10 s using 30% laser power and images were captured every 30 s. Fluorescence intensity was measured by ImageJ. Background signal was subtracted and the intensity of bleached spot was normalized to non-bleached control spot at each time point. The normalized intensity of bleached spot was compared with the intensity of pre-bleaching time point.
The human NPM2 expression unit was from the Akey lab ( Platonova et al., 2011 54. Platonova, O. ∙ Akey, I.V. ∙ Head, J.F. ... Crystal structure and function of human nucleoplasmin (npm2): a histone chaperone in oocytes and embryos Biochemistry. 2011; 50 :8078-8089 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recombinant NPM2 was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified. Specifically, NPM2 expressing BL21 (DE3) cells were cultured in 400 mL 2 × YT medium supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 0.2% lactose and 2 mM MgCl 2 for 20 hours at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. After harvesting cells at 4°C, the pellet was lysed for 1 hour on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 1.3 mg/ml lysozyme and 1.3 mg/ml deoxycholic acid). After removing insoluble components by centrifugation (23,000 g ) for 15 min, the supernatant was incubated on ice for 8 hours. Lysis buffer was added to the supernatant up to 37 mL and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new 50 mL tube, incubated at 80°C for 10 min, and then immediately placed on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation (10,000 g ) for 30 min to remove denatured insoluble components, the supernatant was concentrated and desalted by centrifugation (4°C, 7,500 g ) for 40 min.
Sperm nuclei were extracted and treated with purified NPM2, as described previously ( Shintomi et al., 2017; Yamaguchi et al., 2018 57. Shintomi, K. ∙ Inoue, F. ∙ Watanabe, H. ... Mitotic chromosome assembly despite nucleosome depletion in Xenopus egg extracts Science. 2017; 356 :1284-1287 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar 71. Yamaguchi, K. ∙ Hada, M. ∙ Fukuda, Y. ... Re-evaluating the Localization of Sperm-Retained Histones Revealed the Modification-Dependent Accumulation in Specific Genome Regions Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :3920-3932 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, sperm tails were removed by sonication for 10 cycles (on: 0.5 s; off: 5.0 s). After washing with PBS, sperm were permeabilized with streptolysin-O (10 units/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and disulfide bond reduced with DTT (2 mM). About 10 7 sperm were incubated with the phosphorylation reaction buffer (2 mM DTT, 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 μM ATP) with 10 μM wild-type or kinase-dead SRPK1 at 37°C for 30 min. After washing with PBS, sperm were resuspended with 1 mL treatment buffer (2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM sodium butyrate, 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.7, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, Complete, and EDTA free) containing 100 to 1,000 μM NPM2 and incubated for 15 to 120 min at 37°C on a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf). After incubation, NPM2-treated sperm were pelleted at 20,400 g for 5 min at 4°C for microscopic analysis.
HA-tagged human NPM2 or HIRA proteins were pulled down from transfected 293T cell lysates with anti-HA antibody-conjugated Protein G beads (ThermoFisher). Protamine peptides were incubated with phosphorylation reaction buffer (2 mM DTT, 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 μM ATP) with 10 μM wild-type or kinase-dead SRPK1 at 37°C for 30 min. After quenching the reaction with 5% acetic acid, protamine peptides were incubated with beads at room temperature for 30 min. After washing the beads with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, proteinase inhibitor cocktail), the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for NPM or HIRA. Protamine samples were dissolved in buffer (0.9N acetic acid, 0.5M 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% sucrose) and separated by electrophoresis in Acid Urea Gel containing 2.5M urea ( Waterborg, 2002 63. Waterborg, J.H. Acid-urea-triton polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of histones Walker, J.M. (Editor) The Protein Protocols Handbook Humana Press, 2002; 113-123 Crossref Google Scholar ).
Sperm were harvested from caudal epididymides of wild-type or knock-in male mice in the C57BL/6 background. MII oocytes for insemination were isolated from superovulated BALB/cJ females. Five hours post insemination, fertilized eggs (confirmed by pronucleus formation under microscope) were harvested for ATAC-seq. Generation of ATAC-seq libraries was according to omniATAC-seq ( Corces et al., 2017 11. Corces, M.R. ∙ Trevino, A.E. ∙ Hamilton, E.G. ... An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :959-962 Crossref Scopus (1214) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, fertilized zygote or sperm were incubated in cold resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl 2 ) containing 0.1% NP-40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin on ice for 3 min and then washed with cold resuspension buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. Tagmentation was next performed with Tn5 transposon enzyme (Illumina) in tagmentation buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20% dimethyl formamide, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin) for 30 min at 37°C on a thermomixer with shaking at 1,000 rpm. Tagmentated DNA was purified using DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 Kit (Zymo Research). PCR was performed to amplify each library for 14 cycles. After purification using DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 Kit (Zymo Research), DNA fragments between 200- to 700-bp in length were selected by double-selection (0.55X and 1.5X) on SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) for constructing ATAC-seq libraries followed by pair-end sequencing on HiSeq4000 (Illumina) in the UCSD Genomics Core.
Statistical parameters were reported either in individual figures or corresponding figure legends. Quantified data were in general presented as bar/line plots, with the error bar corresponding to mean ± SEM or boxplot, showing the median (middle line), first and third quartiles (box boundaries), and furthest observation or 1.5 times of the interquartile (end of whisker). All statistical analyses were done in R. Whenever asterisks are used to indicate statistical significance, ∗ stands for p < 0.05; ∗∗ for p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗ for p < 0.001.
The raw data FASTQ files and processed BigWig files for all sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI GEO under GSE136403 .
