Title: A Neuro-hormonal Circuit for Paternal Behavior Controlled by a Hypothalamic Network Oscillation


Abstract: Summary

Parental behavior is pervasive throughout the animal kingdom and essential for species survival. However, the relative contribution of the father to offspring care differs markedly across animals, even between related species. The mechanisms that organize and control paternal behavior remain poorly understood. Using Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice, two species at opposite ends of the paternal spectrum, we identified that distinct electrical oscillation patterns in neuroendocrine dopamine neurons link to a chain of low dopamine release, high circulating prolactin, prolactin receptor-dependent activation of medial preoptic area galanin neurons, and paternal care behavior in male mice. In rats, the same parameters exhibit inverse profiles. Optogenetic manipulation of these rhythms in mice dramatically shifted serum prolactin and paternal behavior, whereas injecting prolactin into non-paternal rat sires triggered expression of parental care. These findings identify a frequency-tuned brain-endocrine-brain circuit that can act as a gain control system determining a species’ parental strategy.

Section: Introduction

Parental strategies shape society because they directly affect the physical and mental well-being of the young generation and emergence of their social skills ( Feldman, 2015 28. Feldman, R.

From an evolutionary perspective, parental behavior is essential for ensuring the survival of a species ( van der Pol et al., 2016 103. van der Pol, L.D. ∙ Groeneveld, M.G. ∙ Endendijk, J.J. ...

Parental Investment and Mating Systems in Mammals Evolution. 1980; 34 :973-982 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). From insects to mammals, the neural substrates encoding this behavior, which has evolved repeatedly across vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, are under strong evolutionary pressure ( Mcnamara and Wolf, 2015 71. Mcnamara, J.M. ∙ Wolf, M. Sexual conflict over parental care promotes the evolution of sex differences in care and the ability to care Proc. Biol. Sci. 2015; 282 :20142752 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ; Clutton-Brock, 1991 17. Clutton-Brock, T.H.

This has shaped the expression of parental behavior based on its adaptive value in each species, ranging from egg-laying site selection or brooding to provisioning, nursing, and teaching of skills.
Many mammalian species are maternally uniparental, but there are exceptions ( Feldman, 2015 28. Feldman, R. The adaptive human parental brain: implications for children’s social development Trends Neurosci. 2015; 38 :387-399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rilling, 2013 84. Rilling, J.K.

Neural control of maternal and paternal behaviors Science. 2014; 345 :765-770 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). Classic examples of the biparental approach are the prairie vole ( Oliveras and Novak, 1986 79. Oliveras, D. ∙ Novak, M. A Comparison of Paternal Behavior in the Meadow Vole Microtus-Pennsylvanicus, the Pine Vole Microtus-Pinetorum and the Prairie Vole Microtus-Ochrogaster Anim. Behav. 1986; 34 :519-526 Crossref Google Scholar ) and California mouse ( Horner, 1947 48. Horner, B.E. Paternal care of young mice of the genus Peromyscus J. Mammal. 1947; 28 :31-36 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dudley, 1974 22. Dudley, D. Paternal behavior in the California mouse, Peromyscus californicus Behav. Biol. 1974; 11 :247-252 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), species in which the males express similar levels of parental care as the lactating females. Interestingly, closely related species can fall at opposite ends of the biparental spectrum ( Oliveras and Novak, 1986 79. Oliveras, D. ∙ Novak, M.

The genetic basis of parental care evolution in monogamous mice Nature. 2017; 544 :434-439 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicative of the dynamic range of the neural and endocrine mechanisms underlying this behavior across the phylogenetic tree.
Maternal behavior is strongly influenced by hormones. A seminal study by Terkel and Rosenblatt (1968) 99. Terkel, J. ∙ Rosenblatt, J.S. Maternal behavior induced by maternal blood plasma injected into virgin rats J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1968; 65 :479-482 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar revealed that transfusion of blood plasma from a lactating dam can induce maternal behavior in virgin female rats. Subsequent work identified that a triad of hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin [Prl]), whose levels rise and remain elevated in the rodent female throughout pregnancy, postpartum, and during raising of the young, are responsible for induction of maternal behavior ( Moltz et al., 1970 74. Moltz, H. ∙ Lubin, M. ∙ Leon, M. ... Hormonal induction of maternal behavior in the ovariectomized nulliparous rat Physiol. Behav. 1970; 5 :1373-1377 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Along with these hormones, oxytocin has been found to play a crucial role in induction and regulation of maternal behavior ( Pedersen and Prange, 1979 80. Pedersen, C.A. ∙ Prange, Jr., A.J. Induction of maternal behavior in virgin rats after intracerebroventricular administration of oxytocin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1979; 76 :6661-6665 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Keverne et al., 1988 54. Keverne, E.B. ∙ Kendrick, K.M. ∙ Poindron, P. Oxytocin and Maternal-Behavior Psychopharmacology. 1988; 96 :S30 Google Scholar ). An imposing catalog of later studies has further fortified the association between maternal hormones and maternal behavior ( Zarrow et al., 1971 111. Zarrow, M.X. ∙ Denenberg, V.H. ∙ Gandelman, R. Prolactin - Is It an Essential Hormone for Maternal Behavior in Mammal Horm. Behav. 1971; 2 :343 Crossref Google Scholar ; Gonzalez and Deis, 1986 38. Gonzalez, D.E. ∙ Deis, R.P. Maternal behavior in cyclic and androgenized female rats: role of ovarian hormones Physiol. Behav. 1986; 38 :789-793 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
The hormone most strongly and specifically implicated in maternal functions is Prl, whose secretion from the anterior pituitary is primarily controlled by tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons located in the dorsomedial arcuate nucleus (dmArc) of the hypothalamus, which exert a powerful inhibitory influence under most physiological conditions in males and virgin females ( Gudelsky, 1981 45. Gudelsky, G.A. Tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons and the regulation of prolactin secretion Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1981; 6 :3-16 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Demarest et al., 1986 20. Demarest, K.T. ∙ Riegle, G.D. ∙ Moore, K.E. The rapid ‘tonic’ and the delayed ‘induction’ components of the prolactin-induced activation of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons following the systemic administration of prolactin Neuroendocrinology. 1986; 43 :291-299 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). This dopamine-mediated inhibition of Prl release operates via activation of the D2 dopamine receptor on Prl-producing lactotroph cells ( Gonzalez-Iglesias et al., 2008 39. Gonzalez-Iglesias, A.E. ∙ Murano, T. ∙ Li, S. ... Dopamine inhibits basal prolactin release in pituitary lactotrophs through pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive signaling pathways Endocrinology. 2008; 149 :1470-1479 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plastic changes in the lactotropic axis are believed to cause the dopaminergic “brake” to lift, resulting in the surge of serum Prl occurring during the late stages of pregnancy and postpartum ( Wang et al., 1993 107. Wang, H.J. ∙ Hoffman, G.E. ∙ Smith, M.S. Suppressed tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic system during lactation Endocrinology. 1993; 133 :1657-1663 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Demarest et al., 1983 19.

Biochemical indices of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neuronal activity during lactation: a lack of response to prolactin Neuroendocrinology. 1983; 36 :130-137 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). This sustained elevation of Prl in the lactating dam is widely recognized to facilitate the expression of lactation and maternal behaviors necessary for raising the offspring ( Bridges et al., 1974 8. Bridges, R.S. ∙ Goldman, B.D. ∙ Bryant, L.P. Serum prolactin concentrations and the initiation of maternal behavior in the rat Horm. Behav. 1974; 5 :219-226 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ; Korányi et al., 1977 57. Korányi, L. ∙ Phelps, C.P. ∙ Sawyer, C.H.

USA. 2017; 114 :10779-10784 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ).
However, although a rich and growing literature has shed light on neural and hormonal regulation of maternal behavior, the mechanisms underlying paternal care for offspring in biparental species remain obscure. It is further not known whether the prerequisites for paternal behavior are in place by default or induced by the process of fathering offspring, as is the case for infanticidal instincts, which are present in the virgin male but largely disappear after mating ( vom Saal, 1985 105. vom Saal, F.S. Time-contingent change in infanticide and parental behavior induced by ejaculation in male mice Physiol. Behav. 1985; 34 :7-15 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Curiously, the male sire in a biparental species is less prone to somatosensory signals from the young and does not respond by increasing serum Prl to levels found in the lactating dam ( Fleming et al., 2002 30. Fleming, A.S. ∙ Corter, C. ∙ Stallings, J. ... Testosterone and prolactin are associated with emotional responses to infant cries in new fathers Horm. Behav. 2002; 42 :399-413 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guillou et al., 2015 46. Guillou, A. ∙ Romanò, N. ∙ Steyn, F. ... Assessment of lactotroph axis functionality in mice: longitudinal monitoring of PRL secretion by ultrasensitive-ELISA Endocrinology. 2015; 156 :1924-1930 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bridges, 1983 7. Bridges, R.S. Sex differences in prolactin secretion in parental male and female rats Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1983; 8 :109-116 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations raise the question of whether paternal behavior is a predisposed state rather than induced via somatosensory input.
The current study was motivated by the recent demonstration of differential activity of TIDA neurons in the males of two commonly used animal models, the rat and the mouse ( Stagkourakis et al., 2018 95. Stagkourakis, S. ∙ Pérez, C.T. ∙ Hellysaz, A. ... Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling eLife. 2018; 7 :e33144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The cellular mechanism of this discrepancy was identified as the presence of strong gap junction coupling between male rat TIDA neurons, contrasting with the complete absence of electrical connectivity in male mice ( Stagkourakis et al., 2018 95. Stagkourakis, S. ∙ Pérez, C.T. ∙ Hellysaz, A. ... Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling eLife. 2018; 7 :e33144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations at the network level beg the question of the potential functional effect of species differences in TIDA oscillation frequency. The role of Prl, the downstream target of TIDA activity, is poorly understood in males, in particular how it pertains to behavior and parenting. Curiously, mating experience allows the behavioral transition from infanticide to paternal behavior, although only in biparental species ( McCarthy and Vom Saal, 1986 69. McCarthy, M.M. ∙ Vom Saal, F.S. Inhibition of infanticide after mating by wild male house mice Physiol. Behav. 1986; 36 :203-209 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Voloschin et al., 1998 104. Voloschin, L.M. ∙ Gallardo, M.G.P. ∙ Tramezzani, J.H. Suckling-induced serum prolactin levels are modified by interference with milk ejection in lactating rats Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59 :182-189 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, filling this gap in knowledge requires not only identifying the effect of Prl on male action patterns but also determining under which conditions Prl may affect male behavior toward offspring: is it necessary, sufficient, and/or permissive?
We hypothesized that the species difference in TIDA circuit configuration may affect one of the characteristics most strongly associated with Prl in the female: care for offspring. We explored this hypothesis, providing a link between the individual components of the lactotropic axis and the central circuits associated with parental behavior. The correlations we found were then evaluated for causality by manipulating the system in mice with optogenetics and conditional deletion of the Prl receptor (Prl-R) and in rats through pharmacology.
The results demonstrate that the distinct oscillatory activity of TIDA neurons establishes the level of serum Prl throughout adulthood, regulating the activity of neural networks implicated in parental behavior and ultimately enabling (or not) the expression of paternal care. This work provides a mechanistic and conceptual understanding of the role of the lactotropic axis in male parental behavior. It further suggests that pre-set hypothalamic neuron activity at the level of network oscillation frequency and serum Prl levels, prime the conditional expression of a behavioral repertoire that can be elicited in the presence of a sire’s own pups.

Section: Results

Recent studies have described a striking species difference in the rhythmic electrical activity of Prl-inhibiting TIDA neurons in the male rat and mouse ( Lyons et al., 2010 66. Lyons, D.J. ∙ Horjales-Araujo, E. ∙ Broberger, C.

Romanò, N. ∙ Yip, S.H. ∙ Hodson, D.J. ... Plasticity of hypothalamic dopamine neurons during lactation results in dissociation of electrical activity and release J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 :4424-4433 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stagkourakis et al., 2018 95. Stagkourakis, S. ∙ Pérez, C.T. ∙ Hellysaz, A. ... Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling eLife. 2018; 7 :e33144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with these observations, male rat TIDA neurons were observed to discharge in robust slow oscillations (typically 0.17 Hz; Figures 1 A, 1C, 1E). In contrast, male mouse TIDA neurons exhibit significantly faster oscillation frequencies (typically 0.45 Hz; Figures 1 B, 1D, and 1E). Notably, male rat TIDA neurons are synchronized and oscillate at the same frequency across cells, slices, and animals, whereas male mouse TIDA neurons are not coordinated and occupy a wide spectrum of faster rhythms ( Figures 1 F–1H; Stagkourakis et al., 2018 95. Stagkourakis, S. ∙ Pérez, C.T. ∙ Hellysaz, A. ... Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling eLife. 2018; 7 :e33144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
The difference between male rat versus mouse TIDA neuron rhythms prompted the question of whether and how differences in oscillation frequency are reflected in TIDA output. We addressed this issue by using optogenetic stimulation to impose a range of electrical frequencies on TIDA neurons and recorded the resultant dopamine concentrations at the release site in the median eminence (ME) by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV; Figure 2 A). Stimulation of axon terminals rather than cell somata was performed because of concerns that the axonal connection may be lost during preparation of the mediobasal hypothalamus slice due to the complex three-dimensional nature of the dmArc and its projections ( Voloschin et al., 1998 104. Voloschin, L.M. ∙ Gallardo, M.G.P. ∙ Tramezzani, J.H. Suckling-induced serum prolactin levels are modified by interference with milk ejection in lactating rats Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59 :182-189 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dopamine Transporter (DAT)-Cre mice were injected with Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in the dmArc ( Figure 2 B), and frequencies spanning 0.1–0.8 Hz were applied. Optogenetic stimulation yielded dose-dependent patterns of dopamine release patterns in the ME. Notably, 0.2 Hz (“rat-like”) and 0.4 Hz (“mouse-like”) stimulation resulted in distinct dopamine release patterns in the ME. When 0.2-Hz stimulation was applied, the dopamine signal in the ME peaked quickly and remained high until light stimulation was terminated ( Figures 2 C and 2D). In contrast, when the 0.4-Hz protocol was applied, [dopamine] rose with similar kinetics but decayed quickly after the initial peak ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Comparisons of different stimulation protocols revealed an inverted U-shaped frequency-response relationship peaking at 0.2 Hz ( Figures 2 G and 2H). The FSCV experiments suggest that the different electrophysiology patterns found in rat and mouse TIDA neurons lead to sustainable versus non-sustainable dopamine release, respectively, at the TIDA terminals. These findings, in conjunction with the inverse relationship between neuroendocrine dopamine and pituitary Prl, raise the possibility that rat and mouse males may have different serum Prl concentrations.
To test whether this is the case, we collected tail blood samples in male rats and mice and quantified serum [Prl] by ELISA. Each sample was also tested for corticosterone (CORT; Figures 3 A, 3B, and 3E) because acute stress brought about by the sampling procedure can influence serum Prl levels ( Neill, 1970 77. Neill, J.D. Effect of “stress” on serum prolactin and luteinizing hormone levels during the estrous cycle of the rat Endocrinology. 1970; 87 :1192-1197 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Seggie and Brown, 1975 91. Seggie, J.A. ∙ Brown, G.M. Stress response patterns of plasma corticosterone, prolactin, and growth hormone in the rat, following handling or exposure to novel environment Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1975; 53 :629-637 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Although rare (n = 5 of 45), samples with [CORT] exceeding 300 × 10 −3 mg/kg were excluded from serum Prl measurements and further analysis. Standard curves using standardized ELISA protocols for CORT and Prl were used to calculate the absolute levels of these hormones in the serum ( Figures 3 A and 3C). Rat serum [Prl] was 0.3889 ± 0.0129 × 10 −3 mg/kg in the virgin male and 0.4150 ± 0.0121 × 10 −3 mg/kg in the sire ( Figures 3 D and 3E). In contrast, serum [Prl] in the male mouse was found to be severalfold higher than in the rat (1.784 ± 0.1136 × 10 −3 mg/kg in virgins and 1.8120 ± 0.1121 × 10 −3 mg/kg in sires). Importantly, serum [Prl] did not differ between physiological states in the rat or mouse, with virgins and sires having comparable serum Prl concentrations ( Figures 3 D and 3E).
Having established a difference in serum Prl in rats and mice, we next addressed whether this discrepancy is reflected in the degree of Prl signaling in the brain. We focused on the medial preoptic area (MPOA; Figure 4 A), a region that has been strongly implicated in regulation of parental behavior ( Lee and Brown, 2007 61. Lee, A.W. ∙ Brown, R.E.

Psychol. 1977; 91 :146-164 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ). Activation of the Prl-R in the MPOA in lactating dams is necessary for the expression of maternal behavior and survival of the offspring ( Brown et al., 2017 13. Brown, R.S.E. ∙ Aoki, M. ∙ Ladyman, S.R. ... Prolactin action in the medial preoptic area is necessary for postpartum maternal nursing behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10779-10784 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is a key downstream step of Prl-R activation and provides a reliable readout of Prl signal transduction ( Gouilleux et al., 1994 40. Gouilleux, F. ∙ Wakao, H. ∙ Mundt, M. ...

In the male virgin rat, only occasional pSTAT5-immunoreactive cells were observed in the MPOA ( Figures 4 B, 4D, and 4E), whereas there was intense staining for this activity marker in the male virgin mouse MPOA ( Figures 4 C–4E), suggesting baseline activation of a key nucleus for organization of parental behavior in the murine brain. We next explored whether MPOA neurons can be stimulated directly by Prl.
Recent work has revealed that activation of MPOA neurons that express the neuropeptide galanin ( Gal + ) can drive parental behavior ( Wu et al., 2014 108. Wu, Z. ∙ Autry, A.E. ∙ Bergan, J.F. ... Galanin neurons in the medial preoptic area govern parental behaviour Nature. 2014; 509 :325-330 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kohl et al., 2018 56.

Functional circuit architecture underlying parental behaviour Nature. 2018; 556 :326-331 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ), a finding that was confirmed in the male mouse in the present study ( Figures S1 A–S1H). To determine the effect of Prl on this parentally implicated MPOA subpopulation, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings using Gal -tdTomato adult male virgin mice ( Figure 4 F). Application of Prl evoked a reversible depolarization in 11 of 13 recorded MPOA Gal + neurons, paralleled by induction of action potential firing ( Figure 4 G). Increased intrinsic excitability was evident in the presence of Prl as augmented firing frequency in response to depolarization ( Figure 4 H) as well as an increase in the input resistance of these cells ( Figure 4 I). Parallel to these excitatory actions, application of Prl resulted in presynaptic changes with an increase in spontaneous excitatory input ( Figure 4 J) and a decrease in spontaneous inhibitory input ( Figure 4 K), effects reconcilable with overall stimulation of MPOA Gal + cells. Investigation of the Prl-induced current in MPOA Gal + neurons by voltage-clamp ramps combined with pharmacological manipulation ( Figures 4 L and 4M) identified K + channels as mediating Prl’s postsynaptic depolarizing effect ( Figure 4 L, cesium + Prl). This effect appeared to be specifically mediated via closure of apamin-sensitive, Ca 2+ -dependent K + channels of the small conductance (“SK”) type but not charybdotoxin-sensitive channels; i.e., of the large conductance (“BK”) type subclass ( Figures 4 L and 4M).
Prl-mediated MPOA Gal + cell activation coupled with the previously identified role of this area in parental behavior led us to test whether a difference occurs at the behavioral level in paternal care between the two species. Rats and mice have been described as uni- versus biparental ( Egid and Lenington, 1983 25. Egid, K. ∙ Lenington, S. Parental Behavior of Wild House Mice Am. Zool. 1983; 23 :930 Google Scholar ; Lee and Brown, 2002 60. Lee, A.W. ∙ Brown, R.E.

Induction of Parental Behavior in Male and Female Rats (Rattus Norvegicus): Influence of Previous Exposure to Pups Biology of Behaviour. 1986; 11 :167-175 Google Scholar ). This made it necessary to assess parental care in the two species side by side.
To compare parental care in male rats and mice, we used the pup retrieval test ( Terkel et al., 1979 100. Terkel, J. ∙ Bridges, R.S. ∙ Sawyer, C.H. Effects of transecting lateral neural connections of the medial preoptic area on maternal behavior in the rat: nest building, pup retrieval and prolactin secretion Brain Res. 1979; 169 :369-380 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang and Storm, 2011 106. Wang, Z. ∙ Storm, D.R. Maternal behavior is impaired in female mice lacking type 3 adenylyl cyclase Neuropsychopharmacology. 2011; 36 :772-781 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was composed of a square arena containing shredded nesting material in one half and typically six pups in the other half ( Figure 5 B). Parental behavior was scored in repeated 1-h sessions for experienced sires and dams of the two species. Rat sires exhibited pup avoidance, in striking contrast to mouse sires, which performed parental behaviors, including nesting, pup retrieval, crouching, and pup grooming ( Figures 5 C–5H). Maternal behavior exhibited by the dams of the two species was similar in the majority of measurements (duration of pup retrieval, duration of proximity to pups, and crouching and nesting durations), with the exception of pup grooming, where rat lactating dams spent more time in comparison with mouse lactating dams ( Figure S2 ).
The accumulated datasets to this point, although correlational, support the hypothesis that the TIDA neuron activity in males sets serum Prl levels, with consequent downstream activation of Prl-responsive brain nodes involved in parental behavior, such as the MPOA. These combined effects might influence or determine the expression of paternal care in a species. The next set of experiments was designed to causally assess the validity of this hypothesis.
First, we addressed whether parental care behavior could be triggered in the normally non-parental male rat by artificially elevating circulating Prl. This necessitated initially determining whether the male rat MPOA is sensitive to Prl, because the naturally occurring low serum Prl levels ( Figure 3 D) could be paralleled by an absence of Prl-Rs. To test whether circulating Prl can induce Prl-R activation in the rat MPOA, we administered 0.08 mg/kg Prl or saline (vehicle) intraperitoneally (i.p.) and collected tail blood 30 min post-administration to determine serum Prl and brain tissue to assess pSTAT5 immunofluorescence ( Figure 6 A). Administration of Prl raised serum Prl levels from 0.61 ± 0.04 × 10 −3 mg/kg to 100.60 ± 10.96 × 10 −3 mg/kg ( Figure 6 D), a serum concentration typically found in rat and mouse lactating dams ( Voloschin et al., 1998 104.

Last, to trigger endogenously sourced hypersecretion of Prl, virgin male rats received an i.p. injection of the dopamine D2 receptor-blocking antipsychotic haloperidol ( Banasikowski and Beninger, 2012 4.

These manipulations increased both serum Prl levels and the number of pSTAT5-positive cells in the rat MPOA ( Figure S3 ), indicative of a functional lactotropic axis in the male rat. These findings provide evidence that elevated circulating Prl can reach the MPOA in a manner consistent with direct mediation via the Prl-R, in agreement with demonstrations that at least some of the MPOA galanin neurons lie outside of the blood-brain barrier ( Rajendren et al., 2000 83. Rajendren, G. ∙ Levenkova, N. ∙ Gibson, M.J. Galanin immunoreactivity in mouse basal forebrain: sex differences and discrete projections of galanin-containing cells beyond the blood-brain barrier Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 71 :27-33 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The above observations raised the possibility that increasing serum Prl, through consequent activation of MPOA neurons, can induce paternal behavior in rat sires. To test this hypothesis, we performed repeated pup retrieval tests in previously identified non-paternal experienced rat sires following saline and Prl administration ( Figure 6 E). Similar to what was observed in baseline behavioral recordings ( Figure 5 ), saline-injected rat sires exhibited pup avoidance ( Figures 6 F–6L; Video S1 ). In striking contrast, Prl-injected rat sires exhibited greater amounts of passive aspects of paternal care, such as crouching and increased time in proximity to the pups, and, importantly, active paternal behaviors, such as pup grooming and mouthing ( Figures 6 F–6L; Video S2 ). Another salient observation was that Prl administration did not induce paternal behavior in virgin male rats ( Figure S4 ), indicating that Prl’s effect on paternal behavior is conditional on having prior sexual experience. Together, these data suggest that Prl acts as a permissive gain control signal in the expression of paternal care, with increased Prl levels able to acutely evoke sequences of paternal behavior in fathers of a non-paternal species.

Induction of Paternal Care in Rat Sires following Acute Administration of Prl at 0.08 mg/kg, Related to Figure 6
Although paternal behavior can be evoked by Prl administration in rat sires ( Figures 6 E–6L), it remains unknown whether Prl is necessary for sexually experienced males to exhibit parental behavior. Furthermore, the brain area(s) critical to Prl’s ability to drive paternal behavior remain unidentified. The MPOA is a prime candidate for testing the role of Prl in paternal behavior because its influence on parental behavior is well established ( Kuroda and Numan, 2014 58. Kuroda, K.O. ∙ Numan, M. The medial preoptic area and the regulation of parental behavior Neurosci. Bull. 2014; 30 :863-865 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Numan et al., 1977 78. Numan, M. ∙ Rosenblatt, J.S. ∙ Komisaruk, B.R. Medial preoptic area and onset of maternal behavior in the rat J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1977; 91 :146-164 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2014 108. Wu, Z. ∙ Autry, A.E. ∙ Bergan, J.F. ... Galanin neurons in the medial preoptic area govern parental behaviour Nature. 2014; 509 :325-330 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ), it exhibits prominent expression of the Prl-R ( Brown et al., 2010 11. Brown, R.S.E. ∙ Kokay, I.C. ∙ Herbison, A.E. ... Distribution of prolactin-responsive neurons in the mouse forebrain J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518 :92-102 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 12. Brown, R.S. ∙ Kokay, I.C. ∙ Phillipps, H.R. ... Conditional Deletion of the Prolactin Receptor Reveals Functional Subpopulations of Dopamine Neurons in the Arcuate Nucleus of the Hypothalamus J. Neurosci. 2016; 36 :9173-9185 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), and, as demonstrated above, MPOA Gal + neurons are directly excited by Prl.
To test this hypothesis, we performed Cre-mediated conditional deletion of the Prl-R in the MPOA, using targeted bilateral injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-Cre into Prl-R floxed animals ( Brown et al., 2017 13. Brown, R.S.E. ∙ Aoki, M. ∙ Ladyman, S.R. ... Prolactin action in the medial preoptic area is necessary for postpartum maternal nursing behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10779-10784 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Successful recombination of the Prl-R resulted in a strong immunoreactive signal for EGFP, whereas in control mice (injected with AAV-mCherry), EGFP immunoreactivity was absent, indicating no recombination of the Prl-R gene ( Figure S5 ). To further confirm the absence of Prl-R activity in AAV-Cre-injected mice, pSTAT5 activity was assessed following an acute dose of exogenous Prl by i.p. administration. Although control mice showed high levels of pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in the MPOA, mice with an MPOA-specific deletion of Prl-R had dramatically reduced numbers of pSTAT5-immunoreactive cells following Prl administration ( Figures 6 M–6O).
To test the effect of MPOA-restricted Prl-R deletion on paternal behavior, Prl-R floxed adult male mice were injected with AAV-mCherry or AAV-Cre in the MPOA. Following successful mating with a female, paternal behavior was tested on pups on post-natal day 3. AAV-Cre treated animals demonstrated major impairments in all aspects of paternal behavior tested, with the exception of nesting ( Figures 6 P–6W). The possibility of non-specific effects of the Cre construct used here was assessed in a previous study of maternal behavior ( Brown et al., 2017 13. Brown, R.S.E. ∙ Aoki, M. ∙ Ladyman, S.R. ... Prolactin action in the medial preoptic area is necessary for postpartum maternal nursing behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10779-10784 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). These experiments showed that no reduction of Prl-R activity or parental behavior occurred when the same AAV-Cre was injected at the same dose and the same stereotactic coordinates in wild-type animals, albeit in female and not male mice. Thus, the results shown above are most likely caused by conditional and specific deletion of the Prl-R rather than adverse effects of the Cre construct itself. These results support the hypothesis that Prl-responsive MPOA neuron activity is critical for the expression of paternal care.
While the above findings suggest that Prl has a permissive (i.e., following mating) but necessary role in paternal behavior, a causal link between the pattern of activity of TIDA neurons, - the “control center” for Prl - and serum Prl levels and paternal behavior remained to be established.
To test the hypothesis that defined TIDA neuron rhythms determine serum Prl and, as a consequence, paternal behavior, we optogenetically recreated the oscillation frequencies recorded in the TIDA system during the pup retrieval test in mouse sires. Distinct frequencies were applied via photostimulation ( Figures 7 A–7D) in repeated trials of the pup retrieval test, during which paternal behavior was recorded, and, at the end of the test, serum Prl was sampled ( Figure 7 E). For this experiment, we used optogenetic inhibition (using eNpHR3 constructs) rather than stimulation (using ChR2) because TIDA neurons are spontaneously active and therefore best entrained by periodic hyperpolarization, whereas depolarization risks interfering with ongoing discharge. This strategy yielded high-fidelity control of TIDA oscillation frequency ( Figure 7 C).
Application of the slow 0.2-Hz frequency (found in the rat) resulted in a decrease in serum Prl to 0.6484 ± 0.2942 × 10 −3 mg/kg in eNpHR3-expressing animals versus 1.828 ± 0.5991 × 10 −3 mg/kg in eYFP-expressing (control) animals ( Figure 7 F). Importantly, photostimulation at 0.2 Hz impaired expression of paternal care, as quantified by the total number of pups retrieved, latency to first pup retrieval, and nest quality ( Figures 7 G–7J). However, optogenetic application of the 0.2-Hz frequency (i.e., the optogenetic regimen that impairs paternal behavior) did not alter locomotion, anxiety display, and preference and motivation parameters ( Figure S6 ).
Application of the fast 0.4-Hz frequency (found in the mouse) had no effect on serum Prl, and mouse sires exhibited levels of paternal care similar to those recorded under baseline conditions ( Figures 5 C–5H and 7 G–7J). Similarly, the 0.1-Hz and 0.8-Hz optogenetic regimens did not alter paternal behavior. Interestingly, a further increase in serum Prl in mouse sires via optogenetically applied fast oscillations on TIDA neurons (0.8 Hz; Figure 7 F) or targeted Cre-dependent genetic ablation of TIDA cells ( Figure S7 ) did not lead to further enhancement of paternal behavior.
These data provide evidence that defined TIDA neuron oscillation frequencies directly tune Prl release and, farther downstream, paternal behavior.

Section: Discussion

Nursing and protection of the vulnerable newborn is crucial for the survival of offspring but also to ensure the perpetuation of a species. Across species, animals practice specific social behaviors to optimize the well-being and survival of their young ( Dulac et al., 2014 23. Dulac, C. ∙ O’Connell, L.A. ∙ Wu, Z. Neural control of maternal and paternal behaviors Science. 2014; 345 :765-770 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zilkha et al., 2017 113. Zilkha, N. ∙ Scott, N. ∙ Kimchi, T. Sexual Dimorphism of Parental Care: From Genes to Behavior Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 40 :273-305 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). A central aspect of parental behavior that exhibits substantial cross-species variability is the extent of paternal involvement. Paternal behavior can also differ considerably between related species, such as the mouse and the rat, as shown here in a direct comparison (present data), in agreement with earlier descriptions of non-parental male rats ( Lonstein and De Vries, 2000 65. Lonstein, J.S. ∙ De Vries, G.J. Sex differences in the parental behavior of rodents Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2000; 24 :669-686 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ) and parental male laboratory mice ( Svare et al., 1977 96. Svare, B. ∙ Bartke, A. ∙ Gandelman, R.

A sexually dimorphic hypothalamic circuit controls maternal care and oxytocin secretion Nature. 2015; 525 :519-522 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although select brain regions (in particular the MPOA), neuromodulators, and hormones have been associated with expression of parenting in the male, current knowledge has yet failed to provide an integrated systems-level, circuit-based understanding of paternal behaviors ( Kohl and Dulac, 2018 55. Kohl, J. ∙ Dulac, C. Neural control of parental behaviors Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2018; 49 :116-122 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here we show that a recently discovered species difference in TIDA neuron oscillations ( Stagkourakis et al., 2018 95. Stagkourakis, S. ∙ Pérez, C.T. ∙ Hellysaz, A. ... Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling eLife. 2018; 7 :e33144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) translates into distinct release volumes of dopamine toward the pituitary. This difference is correlated with high serum Prl and MPOA activation in the male mouse in contrast to the male rat: a hormonal and brain activation state that leads to opposing approaches to paternal care. Optogenetic control of TIDA oscillations suggests that frequency tuning of this network rhythm causally determines circulating Prl levels and parental behavior in the male. Furthermore, by exogenously raising serum Prl levels in rats, paternal behaviors can be induced in non-parental sires (but not in virgin males). Conditional knockout of the Prl-R in the MPOA confirmed that Prl action here is required for normal expression of paternal behavior in male mice. These data reveal a frequency-tuned brain-endocrine-brain circuit that can serve as a gain control mechanism for paternal care of offspring.
Although neuronal oscillations are found in a multitude of systems across the neuraxis and are now broadly viewed as a fundamental mode of operation for neuronal computations ( Lisman and Buzsáki, 2008 64. Lisman, J. ∙ Buzsáki, G. A neural coding scheme formed by the combined function of gamma and theta oscillations Schizophr. Bull. 2008; 34 :974-980 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ; Singer and Gray, 1995 93. Singer, W. ∙ Gray, C.M. Visual feature integration and the temporal correlation hypothesis Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18 :555-586 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), it remains poorly understood how different frequencies affect the output of a circuit. We recently demonstrated that the slow and fast oscillation frequencies of rat and mouse TIDA neurons, respectively, can be explained by dense and strong gap junction coupling in the former and complete absence of electrical synapses in the latter ( Stagkourakis et al., 2018 95. Stagkourakis, S. ∙ Pérez, C.T. ∙ Hellysaz, A. ... Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling eLife. 2018; 7 :e33144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In the current study, oscillation frequencies spanning a narrow interval (that includes the rat and mouse rhythms) were found to yield markedly different dopamine release. The failure to sustain high release at 0.4 Hz or higher is likely most parsimoniously explained as an inability to match exocytosis (demand) with reuptake and/or de novo synthesis (supply) of dopamine. The issue of how network oscillation frequency, although relevant to many brain systems, shapes the output of an ensemble is largely unexplored. However, a partly related issue regarding stimulus-secretion coupling in different discharge patterns (i.e., single spikes versus bursting) has been explored in midbrain dopamine and neuroendocrine magnocellular systems, where vesicle release is more efficient in bursting than in tonic discharge mode ( Dutton and Dyball, 1979 24. Dutton, A. ∙ Dyball, R.E. Phasic firing enhances vasopressin release from the rat neurohypophysis J. Physiol. 1979; 290 :433-440 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Gonon, 1988 37. Gonon, F.G. Nonlinear relationship between impulse flow and dopamine released by rat midbrain dopaminergic neurons as studied by in vivo electrochemistry Neuroscience. 1988; 24 :19-28 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We found that circulating Prl is severalfold higher in male mice than in rats. Prl measurements, using different techniques, are common in the literature ( Aquino et al., 2017 2. Aquino, N.S.S. ∙ Araujo-Lopes, R. ∙ Henriques, P.C. ... α-Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors Modulate Kisspeptin Effects on Prolactin: Role in Estradiol-Induced Prolactin Surge in Female Rats Endocrinology. 2017; 158 :1812-1826 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guillou et al., 2015 46.

Assessment of lactotroph axis functionality in mice: longitudinal monitoring of PRL secretion by ultrasensitive-ELISA Endocrinology. 2015; 156 :1924-1930 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), but, to our knowledge, the two species have not been measured in parallel in one study. Intriguingly, despite the clear differences in Prl levels in male rats and mice, neither species showed a difference between virgins and sires. These results are in contrast to some distinctly biparental species where Prl levels are elevated in fathers; e.g., Peromyscus ( Gubernick and Nelson, 1989 44. Gubernick, D.J. ∙ Nelson, R.J. Prolactin and paternal behavior in the biparental California mouse, Peromyscus californicus Horm. Behav. 1989; 23 :203-210 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and marmosets ( Dixson and George, 1982 21. Dixson, A.F. ∙ George, L. Prolactin and parental behaviour in a male New World primate Nature. 1982; 299 :551-553 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). It cannot be excluded that laboratory mice, which have been bred selectively through multiple generations to optimize procreant success (which may include not only aspects of fertility but also parenting behaviors; Wu et al., 2014 108. Wu, Z. ∙ Autry, A.E. ∙ Bergan, J.F. ... Galanin neurons in the medial preoptic area govern parental behaviour Nature. 2014; 509 :325-330 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ) have evolved distinct features of the reproductive axis. Nevertheless, the insensitivity of Prl to paternal status in male C57BL/6 mice (present results), with their proficiency for paternal care ( Mak and Weiss, 2010 67. Mak, G.K. ∙ Weiss, S.

Psychobiol. 1978; 11 :23-30 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggests that the role of the hormone is permissive (rather than sufficient in exclusivity). This conclusion is further supported by the presence of a strong pSTAT5 signal in virgin and sire male mice alike, as shown here. Notably, male adult responses to pups depend on experience in this species; prior to fathering, pup encounters commonly elicit infanticide in male mice, a behavior that abates after successful reproduction ( vom Saal, 1985 105. vom Saal, F.S. Time-contingent change in infanticide and parental behavior induced by ejaculation in male mice Physiol. Behav. 1985; 34 :7-15 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is expected that additional factors contribute to establishing paternal care.
However, a causal role of Prl in male parenting is highlighted by our demonstration that acute administration of the hormone is sufficient to induce several aspects of pup care in non-paternal rat sires (in agreement with results by Sakaguchi et al., 1996 87. Sakaguchi, K. ∙ Tanaka, M. ∙ Ohkubo, T. ... Induction of brain prolactin receptor long-form mRNA expression and maternal behavior in pup-contacted male rats: promotion by prolactin administration and suppression by female contact Neuroendocrinology. 1996; 63 :559-568 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These actions, taking place with short latency (within an hour) are unlikely to involve the neurogenesis-promoting properties of Prl ( Hunt and Jacobson, 1971 49. Hunt, R.K. ∙ Jacobson, M. Neurogenesis in frogs after early larval treatment with somatotropin or prolactin Dev. Biol. 1971; 26 :100-124 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shingo et al., 2003 92. Shingo, T. ∙ Gregg, C. ∙ Enwere, E. ... Pregnancy-stimulated neurogenesis in the adult female forebrain mediated by prolactin Science. 2003; 299 :117-120 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ), a phenomenon that has been implicated in the ability of male mice to recognize their pups ( Mak and Weiss, 2010 67. Mak, G.K. ∙ Weiss, S. Paternal recognition of adult offspring mediated by newly generated CNS neurons Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13 :753-758 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). The basal circulating Prl levels, sufficiently high for stimulating parental care in mouse sires, are indicative of a preadaptation to fatherhood, distinct from the dramatic surge of Prl that occurs in late pregnancy in female mice, persisting into the nursing period ( Guillou et al., 2015 46. Guillou, A. ∙ Romanò, N. ∙ Steyn, F. ... Assessment of lactotroph axis functionality in mice: longitudinal monitoring of PRL secretion by ultrasensitive-ELISA Endocrinology. 2015; 156 :1924-1930 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), similar to human mothers ( Frantz, 1973b 33. Frantz, A.G. The regulation of prolactin secretion in humans Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1973; 0 :337-374 PubMed Google Scholar ). A “mating-insensitive” Prl tone in the male does not exclude the possibility that scaling of oscillation frequency can yield individual differences in Prl (and, by inference, parental behavior) or that dynamic tuning of frequency within an individual can occur to modulate behavioral expression. Our demonstration that optogenetic manipulation of TIDA oscillations can lower and elevate serum Prl suggests that TIDA rhythms can act as a gain control for Prl in the male. However, it is important to note the non-linearity in the mechanism of action of Prl because a further increase in serum Prl in mouse sires via optogenetically applied fast oscillations on TIDA neurons ( Figure 7 F) or via targeted Cre-dependent genetic ablation of TIDA cells ( Figure S7 ) does not further enhance paternal behavior. Last, in female rodents, we have reported a switch in TIDA oscillation frequency with pregnancy and lactation ( Briffaud et al., 2015 9. Briffaud, V. ∙ Williams, P. ∙ Courty, J. ... Excitation of tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons by oxytocin: crosstalk in the control of lactation J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :4229-4237 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thörn Pérez et al., 2020 101. Thörn Pérez, C. ∙ Ferraris, J. ∙ van Lunteren, J.A. ... Adaptive Resetting of Tuberoinfundibular Dopamine (TIDA) Network Activity during Lactation in Mice J. Neurosci. 2020; 40 :3203-3216 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that the neuroendocrine dopamine network may be subject to frequency tuning as adaptive demands for Prl change.
The actions of Prl on paternal care are mediated through the MPOA; we show that (1) phosphorylation of STAT5, a sensitive indicator of the Prl-R pathway ( Gouilleux et al., 1994 40. Gouilleux, F. ∙ Wakao, H. ∙ Mundt, M. ... Prolactin induces phosphorylation of Tyr694 of Stat5 (MGF), a prerequisite for DNA binding and induction of transcription EMBO J. 1994; 13 :4361-4369 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), is greater in male mice compared with rats; (2) this activation increases when serum Prl is increased; (3) MPOA Gal + neurons are directly (as well as indirectly) stimulated by Prl; and (4) Prl-R deletion specifically from MPOA neurons decreases paternal behavior. The MPOA, especially galanin neurons, has emerged as a final common pathway for parental behavior ( Wu et al., 2014 108. Wu, Z. ∙ Autry, A.E. ∙ Bergan, J.F. ... Galanin neurons in the medial preoptic area govern parental behaviour Nature. 2014; 509 :325-330 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Prl-R neurons in the MPOA are necessary brain targets for Prl to drive maternal care ( Brown et al., 2017 13. Brown, R.S.E. ∙ Aoki, M. ∙ Ladyman, S.R. ... Prolactin action in the medial preoptic area is necessary for postpartum maternal nursing behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10779-10784 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, a recent spatial transcriptomics study ( Moffitt et al., 2018 73. Moffitt, J.R. ∙ Bambah-Mukku, D. ∙ Eichhorn, S.W. ... Molecular, spatial, and functional single-cell profiling of the hypothalamic preoptic region Science. 2018; 362 :eaau5324 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ) demonstrated expression of the Prl-R in galanin neurons of the MPOA, but it should be noted that the receptor is also observed in non-galaninergic neurons of this nucleus, suggesting that additional MPOA populations may contribute to the parental effects of Prl. In turn, these neurons appear to recruit a broad panel of downstream CNS targets that generate specific components of parenting ( Kohl et al., 2018 56. Kohl, J. ∙ Babayan, B.M. ∙ Rubinstein, N.D. ... Functional circuit architecture underlying parental behaviour Nature. 2018; 556 :326-331 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we show that Prl excites presynaptic inputs of MPOA Gal + neurons ( Figures 4 J and 4K) and that it mediates its actions at least in part via a post-synaptic effect ( Figures 4 L and 4M). Identification of SK channel inhibition as the mechanism underlying the post-synaptic action of Prl ( Figures 4 L and 4M) can explain the emergence of high-frequency firing in MPOA Gal + neurons in the presence of the hormone ( Figure 4 H; Ellis et al., 2007 27. Ellis, L.D. ∙ Mehaffey, W.H. ∙ Harvey-Girard, E. ... SK channels provide a novel mechanism for the control of frequency tuning in electrosensory neurons J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :9491-9502 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yen et al., 1999 109. Yen, J.C. ∙ Chan, J.Y. ∙ Chan, S.H. Involvement of apamin-sensitive SK channels in spike frequency adaptation of neurons in nucleus tractus solitarii of the rat J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6 :418-424 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and, consequently, increased network output. It remains to be determined whether Prl acts on all MPOA Gal + subsets or whether it is biased toward some of the functional subgroups identified by Kohl et al. (2018) 56. Kohl, J. ∙ Babayan, B.M. ∙ Rubinstein, N.D. ... Functional circuit architecture underlying parental behaviour Nature. 2018; 556 :326-331 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar . Among the neurons recorded in our study, Prl responsiveness was nearly uniform, but a correlation with downstream targets of these cells will be an intriguing subject for future studies. Our data also do not exclude additional brain targets for Prl in control of parental behavior. There are several populations expressing the Prl-R that form an interconnected network, each of which contributes to maternal care performance ( Brown et al., 2017 13. Brown, R.S.E. ∙ Aoki, M. ∙ Ladyman, S.R. ... Prolactin action in the medial preoptic area is necessary for postpartum maternal nursing behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10779-10784 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). The role of this network in the male is one of the questions prompted by the present results.
In conclusion, the findings presented here reveal how distinct coupling schemes within a hypothalamic network, resulting in distinct membrane potential oscillation frequencies, can set the tone in a hormonal axis and, thus, determine species-specific parental strategies. By using two related model species characterized by bi- and uniparental strategies, respectively, we provide causal evidence that Prl can act as a driver of paternal behavior in rodents and that factors that influence the rhythm of TIDA neurons may serve as gain control checks for parental behavior in fathers. Although the electrical properties of the human TIDA system have remained inaccessible to experimental analysis, the similarities in the role of dopamine in Prl control in humans and rodents ( Frantz, 1973a 32. Frantz, A.G. Catecholamines and the control of prolactin secretion in humans Prog. Brain Res. 1973; 39 :311-322 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Ben-Jonathan et al., 2008 5. Ben-Jonathan, N. ∙ LaPensee, C.R. ∙ LaPensee, E.W. What can we learn from rodents about prolactin in humans? Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29 :1-41 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggest the possibility that similar mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved across species.

All animal experiments had received approval from the local ethical board, Stockholms Norra Djurförsöksetiska Nämnd , and were performed in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC). Adult rodents were used, typically between 2 to 8 months old, according to the demands of each experiment (sexually inexperienced or parental state). Wild-type mice with C57BL/6J background were used, in addition to previously generated C57BL/6J Slc6a Cre (DAT-Cre) knock-in ( Ekstrand et al., 2007 26. Ekstrand, M.I. ∙ Terzioglu, M. ∙ Galter, D. ... Progressive parkinsonism in mice with respiratory-chain-deficient dopamine neurons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :1325-1330 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar ) and floxed-tdTomato mice (The Jackson Laboratory, strain datasheet – 007909). Gal-Cre BAC transgenic mice (strain: Tg(Gal-cre)KI87Gsat/Mmucd, citation ID: RRID:MMRRC_031060-UCD) were purchased from MMRRC. Wild-type Sprague Dawley (Crl:SD) rats were used (own breeding), and were originally acquired from Charles River. Animals were group-housed, up to five per cage, in a temperature (23°C) and humidity (55%) controlled environment, in a 12h light, 12h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Cages were changed on a weekly basis.
Prlr lox/lox mice. Generation of Prlr lox/lox animals has been previously described ( Brown et al., 2016 12. Brown, R.S. ∙ Kokay, I.C. ∙ Phillipps, H.R. ... Conditional Deletion of the Prolactin Receptor Reveals Functional Subpopulations of Dopamine Neurons in the Arcuate Nucleus of the Hypothalamus J. Neurosci. 2016; 36 :9173-9185 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were generated on a C57BL/6 background, with exon 5 of the Prlr gene flanked by lox66 and lox71 sites, along with an inverted copy of green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter. Cre-mediated inversion of this sequence renders a non-functional Prlr (deletion of exons 5-10) and induction of eGFP expression under the control of the Prlr promoter. Thus, eGFP expression in the brain can be used as a marker of successful Prlr deletion (and as a marker of cells that normally express the Prlr). All mice were housed in individually ventilated cages with shredded paper nesting material and kept in temperature-controlled rooms (22 ± 1°C) on 12:12 hour light/dark cycles with ad libitum access to food and water. Males were initially group housed until paired with a female for the experiment.
Acute brain slices were prepared from mice and rats. Slices were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S) to 250 μm thickness and continuously perfused with oxygenated aCSF containing (in millimolar): NaCl (127), KCl (2.0), NaH 2 PO 4 (1.2), NaHCO 3 (26), MgCl 2 (1.3), CaCl 2 (2.4), and D-glucose (10). Slices were exposed only to a single bath application of pharmacological compounds and were used for a single experiment. Whole-cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings were performed with micropipettes filled with intracellular solution containing (in millimolar), K-gluconate (140), KCl (10), HEPES (10), EGTA (10), and Na 2 ATP (2) or Cesium methanesulfonate (140), KCl (10), HEPES (10), EGTA (10), and Na 2 ATP (2) (pH 7.3 with KOH). Recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, a DigiData 1440 digitizer, and pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Slow and fast capacitative components were semi-automatically compensated. Access resistance was monitored throughout the experiments, and neurons in which the series resistance exceeded 15 MΩ or changed ≥ 20% were excluded from the statistics. Liquid junction potential was 16.4 mV and not compensated. The recorded current was sampled at 20 kHz. Spontaneous excitatory currents were sampled at the reversal of Cl - (V hold = −70 mV), and spontaneous inhibitory currents were sampled during short intervals – typically 1 min – at the reversal of fast excitatory neurotransmission (V hold = +10 mV). All recordings were performed at near physiological temperature (33 ± 1°C). Reagents used in slice electrophysiology experiments; Prl (CYT-321 – PROSPEC), Neurobiotin™ tracer (Vector laboratories) was used in combination with Streptavidin, DyLight™ 405 conjugated (21831 Thermo Scientific) or Avidin-FITC (43-4411 Invitrogen). MATLAB and OriginPro8 were used for electrophysiological data analysis.
Identification of the Prl induced current was performed via the use of a voltage clamp ramp protocol, as illustrated in Figure 4 L. The cell response to a one second duration voltage clamp ramp was recorded during baseline (or in the presence of a K + channel blocker) – Ramp1, and following application of Prl – Ramp 2. Digital subtraction of the recorded currents (Ramp 2 – Ramp 1), led to the isolation of the Prl-induced current and its modulation by distinct K + channel blockers. Prl was used at 200 nM, intracellular Cesium methanesulfonate at 140 mM, Charybdotoxin at 200 nM and Apamin at 300 nM.
Mouse and rat TIDA neurons and mouse Gal + MPOA neurons were recorded in whole-cell mode with intracellular pipette solution as above, with the addition of 0.2% neurobiotin. After recording, slices were placed in fixative (4% paraformaldehyde/0.16% picric acid), washed in PBS, and incubated at 4°C for 72h in a solution containing FITC-conjugated avidin (1:2500, 43-4411, Zymed) and mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase immunoglobulin (1:2000, MAB318, Millipore). After extensive washing, slices were incubated in secondary Alexa-647-conjugated donkey-anti mouse antiserum (1:500, Invitrogen, A21202) at 4°C for 16h, washed again and mounted with 2.5% DABCO in glycerol. TIDA identity of all filled cells was confirmed with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity.
Photostimulation during slice whole-cell recordings was accomplished via a 3.4 W 594 nm LED mounted on the microscope oculars and delivered through the 63X objective’s lens. Photostimulation was controlled via the analog outputs of a DigiData 1440A, enabling control over the duration and intensity. The photostimulation diameter through the objective lens was ∼350 μm with illumination intensity typically scaled to 3 mW/mm 2 .
In optogenetic experiments, subjects were coupled via a ferrule patch cord to a ferrule on the head of the mouse using a zirconia split sleeve (Doric Lenses). The optical fiber was connected to a laser (CNI-MLL-III-635-200-5-LED, CNI lasers 200 mW) via a fiber-optic rotary joint (FRJ_1x1_FC-FC, Doric Lenses) to avoid twisting of the cable caused by the animal’s movement. After a testing session, DAT-Cre animals were uncoupled from the fiber-optic cable and returned to their home cage. The frequency and duration of photostimulation were controlled using custom-written LabView software. Laser power was controlled by dialing an analog knob on the power supply of the laser sources. Light power was measured from the tip of the ferrule in the patch cord before being installed in the brain (the ferrule-connector system) at different laser output settings, using an optical power and energy meter and a photodiode power sensor (Thorlabs). Upon identification of the fiber placement coordinates in brain tissue slides, irradiance (light intensity) was calculated using the brain tissue light transmission calculator based on ( https://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php ) using laser power measured at the tip and the distance from the tip to the target brain region measured by histology. Animals showing no detectable viral expression in the target region and/or ectopic fiber placement were excluded from the analysis.
Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, i.p., Sanofi-Aventis), then transcardially perfused with 10 mL Ca 2+ -free Tyrode’s solution (37°C) containing 0.2% heparin, followed by 10 mL fixative (4% paraformaldehyde and 0.4% picric acid in 0.16 M phosphate buffer (PBS), 37°C), then 50 mL ice-cold fixative. Whole brains were dissected, immersed in ice-cold fixative for 90 min then stored in 0.1M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 20% sucrose, 0.02% bacitracin, and 0.01% sodium azide for three days, before freezing with CO 2 . Coronal sections were cut at a thickness of 14 μm on a cryostat (Microm, Walldorf) and thaw-mounted onto gelatine-coated glass slides. For the dataset presented in Figures 6 M–6W and S5 mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/ kg -1 ) and brains collected following transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed in the same fixative overnight then transferred to 30% sucrose solution for 48 hours prior to being frozen and stored at −80°C until processing. Three sets of 30-μm thick coronal sections through the forebrain were cut using a sliding microtome.
Immunohistochemistry for pSTAT5: Prior to immunofluorescence staining, antigen retrieval was performed by incubating sections for 15 minutes in citric acid (pH 7.4) at 80°C, then cooled at room temperature for a further 30 minutes. After a 1% H 2 O 2 Tris-buffered wash, sections were incubated in rabbit pSTAT5 primary antibody (pSTAT5 Tyr 694, Cat#: C11C5, 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology) for 72 hours at 4°C. Primary antibody incubation was followed by Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antisera (1:500; Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence for tyrosine hydroxylase: Anti-TH antiserum was applied on sections at 4°C over-night (1:2000; raised in rabbit, AB152, Millipore). Primary antibody incubation was followed by Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antisera (1:500; Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence for NeuN: NeuN was detected with rabbit anti-NeuN primary antibody (1:500; Cell Signaling, D4G40). Primary antibody incubation was followed by Alexa-647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antisera (1:500; Invitrogen). For the dataset presented in Figure 6 N, pSTAT5 immunohistochemistry was performed using rabbit pSTAT5 primary antibody at 1:1000 dilution and visualized using DAB, as described previously ( Brown et al., 2010 11. Brown, R.S.E. ∙ Kokay, I.C. ∙ Herbison, A.E. ... Distribution of prolactin-responsive neurons in the mouse forebrain J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518 :92-102 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). In data presented in Figure S5 , immunohistochemistry for eGFP was performed according to Brown et al. (2016) 12. Brown, R.S. ∙ Kokay, I.C. ∙ Phillipps, H.R. ... Conditional Deletion of the Prolactin Receptor Reveals Functional Subpopulations of Dopamine Neurons in the Arcuate Nucleus of the Hypothalamus J. Neurosci. 2016; 36 :9173-9185 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar using rabbit GFP primary antibody at 1:30,000 and visualized using DAB ( Brown et al., 2016 12. Brown, R.S. ∙ Kokay, I.C. ∙ Phillipps, H.R. ... Conditional Deletion of the Prolactin Receptor Reveals Functional Subpopulations of Dopamine Neurons in the Arcuate Nucleus of the Hypothalamus J. Neurosci. 2016; 36 :9173-9185 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Brightfield images were taken, and cell counts were made using ImageJ.
All brain slices were imaged by confocal microscopy (Zeiss, LSM 800) for subsequent analysis. Brain areas were determined according to their anatomy using Paxinos and Franklin Brain Atlas ( Franklin and Paxinos, 2008 31. Franklin, K.B.J. ∙ Paxinos, G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotactic Coordinates Academic Press, 2008 Google Scholar ). For arcuate nucleus and MPOA cell counts, the entire areas were cut, stained and counted. All counts were done manually using ImageJ software and blind to test conditions.
Carbon fiber working electrodes were produced by aspirating 7 μm diameter carbon fibers (Cytec engineered materials, Tempe, AZ) into borosilicate glass capillaries (1.2 mm O.D., 0.69 mm I.D., Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). The capillaries were subsequently pulled with a commercial micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, P-97) and sealed with epoxy (EpoTek 301, Epoxy Technology, Billerica, MA). The electrode tips were polished at a 45° angle on a diamond dust-embedded micropipette-bevelling wheel (Model BV-10, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Electrodes were tested performing bath applications of known concentrations of dopamine. Only electrodes showing reaction kinetics typical of dopamine (as examined in current versus time plots, and current versus voltage plots) were used.
A Dagan Chem-Clamp potentiostat (Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN) and two data acquisition boards (PCI-6221, National Instruments, Austin, TX) run by the TH 1.0 CV program (ESA, Chelmsford, MA) were used to collect all electrochemical data. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained by applying a triangular waveform potential (−0.4 to +1.3 V versus Ag/AgCl) repeated every 100 ms at a scan rate of 200 V/s (low pass Bessel filter at 3 kHz). Each cyclic voltammogram was a background-subtracted average of ten successive cyclic voltammograms taken at the maximum oxidation peak current. All electrodes were allowed to cycle for at least 15 min prior to recording to stabilize the background current. The recorded current response was converted to dopamine concentration via in vitro electrode calibration with standard dopamine solution after each experiment. Acquired data were analyzed and plotted using MATLAB routines and statistical analysis was performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Whole blood samples of 200 μL were collected from the tail vein of restrained mice and rats ( Lee and Goosens, 2015 62. Lee, G. ∙ Goosens, K.A. Sampling Blood from the Lateral Tail Vein of the Rat J. Vis. Exp. 2015; e52766 PubMed Google Scholar ). Only blood samples acquired within 2 min post-restraining were used for hormone measurements, and the subjects were then returned to their home cage. Briefly, the rodent’s tail was immersed for 30 s in 40°C water to dilate the tail vessels. Immediately after, a 23G needle was used to puncture the lateral tail vein, and whole blood was collected. Bleeding was stopped via applying gentle pressure to the tail at the level of the puncture with surgical cleaning tissue, and 2% chlorhexidine antiseptic solution was used for tail disinfection at the end of the procedure. Blood samples were refrigerated at 4°C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 4 ο C at 2000 R CF. Following centrifugation, serum was collected and was frozen at −80°C for a maximal period of 2 months prior to performing ELISA measurements. All blood samples were acquired between 13:00 and 15:00 during the day.
96-well antibody pre-coated plates were used in a ready-to-use kits for both Prl (Sigma-Aldrich RAB1153 or ThermoFisher Scientific – Catalog number EMPrl), and corticosterone (ThermoFisher Scientific – Catalogue number EIACORT). A linear regression was used to fit the optical densities for the standard curve versus their concentration. The standard curve range for Prl was 30 to 20000 pg/mL. The standard curve range for corticosterone was 300 to 100000 pg/mL. Concentrations were calculated from the optical density at 450 nm of each sample. Appropriate sample dilutions were carried out to maintain detection in the linear part of the standard curve, and typically involved 1 to 3 for rat serum samples and 1 to 10 or 20 for mouse serum samples. Data acquired from the performed ELISAs are presented as absolute values. Differences between groups were identified by Student’s t test or ANOVA.
For channelrhodopsin in vitro optogenetic studies, animals were injected in the arcuate nucleus with 200 nL of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP-WPRE-hGH (Addgene20298) 8.41 × 10 12 genomic copies per mL. For in vivo optogenetic experiments and neuron photoinhibition, 200 nL of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP-WPRE-hGH (Addgene26966) 7.02 × 10 12 genomic copies per mL were injected in the arcuate nucleus. Control groups were injected with 200 nL of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP-WPRE-hGH (Addgene27056) 5.82 × 10 12 genomic copies per mL. Viral injections were performed bilaterally. Control injections of the Cre dependent viral constructs were performed in C57 wild-type mice; no fluorophore expression was detected in these animals. For targeted cell ablation of DAT + arcuate nucleus neurons, animals were injected in the arcuate with 300 nL of AAV5-flex-taCasp3-TEVp 2.9 × 10 12 genomic copies per mL. For deletion of Prlr from the MPOA, 1 μL of AAV/DJ-CMV-mCherry-T2A-iCre (Vector Biolabs VB7600) 1.4 × 10 13 genomic copies per mL was injected into the MPOA. Control groups were injected with 1 μL of AAV/DJ-CMV-mCherry (Vector Biolabs VB7777) 3.7 × 10 13 genomic copies per mL. Viral injections were performed bilaterally. Viruses were prepared by Vector BioLabs (Malvern, PA) and the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core.
Adult DAT-Cre male mice of 2-8 months age were stereotactically injected. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (1–5%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). The virus was injected into the arcuate nucleus bilaterally using a pulled glass capillary (World Precision Instruments) by nanolitre pressure injection at a flow rate of 50 nL per min (Micro4 controller, World Precision Instruments; Nanojector II, Drummond Scientific). Stereotactic injection coordinates to target the arcuate nucleus were obtained from the Paxinos and Franklin atlas ( Franklin and Paxinos, 2008 31. Franklin, K.B.J. ∙ Paxinos, G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotactic Coordinates Academic Press, 2008 Google Scholar ) (Bregma: −1.8 mm, midline ± 0.1 mm, dorsal surface −5.5 mm). Ferrules and fiber-optic patch cords were purchased from Thorlabs and Doric Lenses, respectively. The virus-injected animals were housed individually during a three-day recovery period, and were then reintroduced to their breeding cage.
Adult male Prlr lox/lox mice (8–10 wk old) were anesthetized under isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. Animals received bilateral 1 μL injections of either AAV/DJ-CMV-mCherry-T2A-iCre (AAV-Cre) or AAV/DJ-CMV-mCherry (control virus) into the MPOA. Coordinates were adjusted for weight of animal (20-25 g: +0.06 anterior to Bregma; −0.48 depth; 25-30 g: +0.07 anterior to Bregma, −0.49 depth). All injections were given at a rate of 100 nL/min, and the syringes were left in situ for 3 min before and 10 min after injections to allow diffusion of the virus. Animals were allowed to recover for three weeks before being used in the experiment.
To knock-out the Prlr gene from the MPOA, Prlr lox/lox mice were injected with AAV-Cre. Successful Cre recombination results in the expression of eGFP and deletion of exons 5-10 of the Prlr gene. This leads to the complete absence of both short- and long-forms of the Prlr in the target tissue in the neurons that express the Cre recombinase ( Brown et al., 2016 12. Brown, R.S. ∙ Kokay, I.C. ∙ Phillipps, H.R. ... Conditional Deletion of the Prolactin Receptor Reveals Functional Subpopulations of Dopamine Neurons in the Arcuate Nucleus of the Hypothalamus J. Neurosci. 2016; 36 :9173-9185 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). This design makes it possible to quantify the number of cells in which the Prlr is knocked-out via quantification of the eGFP fluorescence. Such information is provided in the present study in Figure S5 .
Investigation of the functional readout of Prlr activation (through pSTAT5 immunohistochemistry), was assessed to verify that the receptor is not present. While pSTAT5 is not exclusively activated by Prl (other cytokines and hormones such as growth hormone can induce phosphorylation of STAT5 through their own receptors ( Fleenor et al., 2006 29. Fleenor, D. ∙ Arumugam, R. ∙ Freemark, M. Growth hormone and prolactin receptors in adipogenesis: STAT-5 activation, suppressors of cytokine signaling, and regulation of insulin-like growth factor I Horm. Res. 2006; 66 :101-110 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar )), it is activated in all cells downstream of the long form of the Prlr ( Ali and Ali, 1998 1. Ali, S. ∙ Ali, S.

In the present study, the lack of pSTAT5 signal following administration of Prl provides evidence of MPOA neurons being functionally unresponsive to Prl.
Rats or mice were acclimated to the testing facility for 1 h before testing. Behaviors were recorded using a digital video recording unit and scored using EthoVision (Noldus Information Technology) or BORIS ( Friard and Gamba, 2016 34. Friard, O. ∙ Gamba, M. BORIS: a free, versatile open-source event-logging software for video/audio coding and live observations Methods Ecol. Evol. 2016; 7 :1325-1330 Crossref Scopus (523) Google Scholar ).
We tested animals for parental behavior with their pups being typically 4-8 days old. The experiments presented in Figure 5 , included parental behavior tested with the first, second and third litters. Testing was performed during the light phase and under 40 lux luminescence. Rodents were acclimated to the testing facility for 1 h before testing. The test subject (sire or dam), pups and nest were transferred to the testing arena with the other parent remaining in the home cage. The testing arena was an open field test arena, and fresh bedding was placed at the beginning of each trial. Trials were 1h in duration. To begin each assay, 2g of shredded cotton provided as nesting material was placed in eight pieces on one side of the arena and typically six pups were placed on the opposite side at maximal distance from each other and the nesting material (see Figure 5 B). Immediately after the test subject was introduced, recordings of the exhibited behaviors were performed for 1h. Behavioral scoring included latency to first approach and total duration of approach/proximity to a pup, crouching over pups (by covering at least 50% of the pup’s body with the parent’s body), pup grooming, huddling over the pup, and pup retrieval (pick up the pup with the mouth and displace it from its original position). Total duration of nesting was also scored and nest quality was assessed at the end of the recording according to the following scale ( Capone et al., 2005 15. Capone, F. ∙ Bonsignore, L.T. ∙ Cirulli, F. Methods in the analysis of maternal behavior in the rodent Curr. Protoc. Toxicol. 2005; Chapter 13 Unit 13.9 PubMed Google Scholar ): 0, nesting material is scattered and proximal to its original placement; 1, few pieces of nesting material have been gathered in a flat platform but most pieces still scattered; 2, all nesting material has been gathered in a flat platform; 3, nesting material has been collected and a hooded nest has been constructed. Behaviors were recorded using a digital video recording unit and scored using EthoVision XT by Noldus.
Experiment presented in Figures 6 M–6W. The experiment presented in Figures 6 M–6W was performed at the University of Otago, using a pup exposure assay ( Tsuneoka et al., 2015 102. Tsuneoka, Y. ∙ Tokita, K. ∙ Yoshihara, C. ... Distinct preoptic-BST nuclei dissociate paternal and infanticidal behavior in mice EMBO J. 2015; 34 :2652-2670 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) during the dark cycle. All methods were approved by University of Otago Animal Ethics Committee. Briefly, males were paired with a wild-type female and co-housed together until day 3 post-partum (PP; the day of parturition was recorded as day 1 PP). On day 3 PP, males were removed from the home cage and singly housed in a novel cage for 24 hours. On the following day, males were transferred to a quiet testing room and allowed to acclimate for at least 15 minutes. Lids were replaced with clear plexiglass and a video camera placed directly above the cage to record behaviors. Following the acclimation period, four pups from the male’s original cage were placed in his cage opposite to his nest. Two of the control male’s litters had less than four pups, so extra pups were supplemented from other cages so that he was exposed to four pups during the test. Previous testing confirmed that paternal males will retrieve both their own or foreign pups at similar rates (unpublished obs). Paternal behaviors were recorded for 30 minutes. Following the end of the test, animals were injected with ovine Prl (5 mg/kg injection/i.p.), to assess the degree of Prl deletion following AAV-Cre administration, and perfused 45 minutes later.
Paternal behaviors were scored from the time all four pups were placed in the male’s cage. Latency to first approach pups, latency to retrieve all four pups, and duration of pup retrieval, proximity to pups, pup grooming, crouching over pups, and nesting were recorded using the program BORIS ( Friard and Gamba, 2016 34. Friard, O. ∙ Gamba, M. BORIS: a free, versatile open-source event-logging software for video/audio coding and live observations Methods Ecol. Evol. 2016; 7 :1325-1330 Crossref Scopus (523) Google Scholar ). Animals which did not retrieve were assigned the value of the length of the test (1800 s). All behaviors were scored identically as the pup assay test used in Figures 5 , 6 , and 7 , with the exception of nesting. In this case, because males already had a nest at the beginning of pup testing, nesting was considered as any adjustment or manipulation to the already existing nesting material.
OFTs were performed in a white acrylic glass box (45 × 45 × 40 cm) with an overhead lamp directed to the center of the field, providing 120 lux of illumination on the floor of the arena. Each mouse was placed in the corner of the apparatus and locomotion parameters were recorded for 15 min. All subjects went through a single 5 min session prior to the OFT day for acclimatization.
The EPM test was performed using a polyvinyl chloride maze comprising a central part (5x5 cm), two opposing open arms (32.5x5 cm), and two opposing closed arms (32.5x5x32.5 cm). The apparatus was set to a height of 50 cm, and the open arms were provided with uniform overhead illumination of 6 lux. Mice were placed in the open arm point close to the center facing the closed arms, and video recordings were performed for a total duration of 20 min. A day prior to the test, mice were placed in the arena for a period of 5 min for acclimatization.
Mice were placed in a custom three-chamber behavioral arena (70 × 35 × 25 cm acrylic glass) for 15 min. In the left chamber, an estrus female was introduced under a “cage” with bars that allow minimal interaction between the sire and the female. The middle compartment of the arena was empty, while the right compartment included a “cage” with the sire’s own pups. The time spent in each chamber was measured in control and eNpHR3 animals with photostimulation at 0.2 Hz.
Behavioral data collection and analysis presented in Figures 6 and 7 were performed blind to experimental conditions. Anatomy data analysis but not tissue collection was blinded. Electrophysiological, voltammetry and behavioral data sampling and analysis presented in Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 were not blinded.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications ( Bendesky et al., 2017 6.

Functional circuit architecture underlying parental behaviour Nature. 2018; 556 :326-331 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data met the assumptions of the statistical tests used, and were tested for normality and equal variance. The ROUT method was used for identification of outliers ( Motulsky and Brown, 2006 76. Motulsky, H.J. ∙ Brown, R.E. Detecting outliers when fitting data with nonlinear regression - a new method based on robust nonlinear regression and the false discovery rate BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7 :123 Crossref Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ). All t tests and one-way ANOVAs were performed using Graph Pad Prism software (Graphpad Software Inc.). The Tukey and Bonferroni posthoc tests were used as appropriate for one-way ANOVAs. Normality was determined by D’Agostino–Pearson normality test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
