Title: Structural Basis for RNA Replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase


Abstract: Summary

Nucleotide analog inhibitors, including broad-spectrum remdesivir and favipiravir, have shown promise in in vitro assays and some clinical studies for COVID-19 treatment, this despite an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12 drug interactions. Here, we examine the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by determining the cryo-EM structures of the stalled pre- and post- translocated polymerase complexes. Compared with the apo complex, the structures show notable structural rearrangements happening to nsp12 and its co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 to accommodate the nucleic acid, whereas there are highly conserved residues in nsp12, positioning the template and primer for an in-line attack on the incoming nucleotide. Furthermore, we investigate the inhibition mechanism of the triphosphate metabolite of remdesivir through structural and kinetic analyses. A transition model from the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecameric primase complex to the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 polymerase complex is also proposed to provide clues for the understanding of the coronavirus transcription and replication machinery.

Section: Introduction

The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease that has led to more than three million cases and a pandemic is caused by a novel virus strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae ( Zhu et al., 2020 43. Zhu, N. ∙ Zhang, D. ∙ Wang, W. ..., China Novel Coronavirus Investigating and Research Team A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :727-733 Crossref Scopus (18832) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previously known coronaviruses (CoVs) that infect humans, e.g., hCoV-OC43, HKU1, and 229E, usually cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses ( Corman et al., 2018 6. Corman, V.M. ∙ Muth, D. ∙ Niemeyer, D. ... Hosts and Sources of Endemic Human Coronaviruses Adv. Virus Res. 2018; 100 :163-188 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, over the past two decades, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged ( de Wit et al., 2016 7. de Wit, E. ∙ van Doremalen, N. ∙ Falzarano, D. ... SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :523-534 Crossref Scopus (2426) PubMed Google Scholar ), including SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the current SARS-CoV-2. Infection with these highly pathogenic coronaviruses can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might lead to a long-term reduction in lung function, arrhythmia, and death ( Graham et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2020 15. Graham, R.L. ∙ Donaldson, E.F. ∙ Baric, R.S. A decade after SARS: strategies for controlling emerging coronaviruses Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11 :836-848 Crossref Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar 17. Huang, C. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, X. ... Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China Lancet. 2020; 395 :497-506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33241) PubMed Google Scholar ). Distinct from MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread more efficiently ( Petrosillo et al., 2020 25. Petrosillo, N. ∙ Viceconte, G. ∙ Ergonul, O. ... COVID-19, SARS and MERS: are they closely related? Clin Microbiol Infect. 2020; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (784) Google Scholar ). Unfortunately, there are currently no highly effective drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, or MERS-CoV.
One of the most promising druggable targets for coronaviruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses. In coronaviruses, it supports the transcription and replication of their ∼30,000-nucleotide large RNA genomes. RdRP is targeted in different RNA viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and CoVs ( Mercorelli et al., 2018 24. Mercorelli, B. ∙ Palù, G. ∙ Loregian, A. Drug Repurposing for Viral Infectious Diseases: How Far Are We? Trends Microbiol. 2018; 26 :865-876 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to several other different positive-sense RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 polymerase displays structural similarity with several key amino acid residues conserved in the active site ( Gao et al., 2020 11. Gao, Y. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from COVID-19 virus Science. 2020; 368 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (1090) PubMed Google Scholar ). This similarity makes drug repurposing an effective strategy that could shorten the drug development time compared to that of de novo drug discovery.
Nucleotide and nucleoside analogs that inhibit polymerases are an important group of antiviral agents ( Debing et al., 2015 8. Debing, Y. ∙ Neyts, J. ∙ Delang, L. The future of antivirals: broad-spectrum inhibitors Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2015; 28 :596-602 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clinical trials are in progress for the treatment of COVID-19 by using the RdRP nucleotide inhibitors, such as remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir. A substantial obstacle for the discovery, optimization, and comprehensive evaluation of effective nucleotide-based drugs for the SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of molecular detail concerning substrate recognition during replication.
To gain insight into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication and its inhibition by nucleotide analog inhibitors, we have determined near-atomic-resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-RNA complex in its catalytic states, including a remdesivir monophosphate (RDV-MP) incorporated pre-translocated complex and a stalled post-translocated complex.

Section: Results

The structure of the RdRP from SARS-CoV-2 bound to non-structural protein 7 (nsp7) and nsp8 co-factors was previously determined in the absence of RNA, providing a view of the overall architecture of the RdRP complex assembly ( Gao et al., 2020 11. Gao, Y. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from COVID-19 virus Science. 2020; 368 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (1090) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the mechanism as to how RdRP recognizes and synthesizes RNA remains unsolved. To address this key issue, we have screened more than ten nucleic acid substrates ( Table S1 ) for their polymerase activity in a primer-dependent RdRP assay ( Figures 1 and S1 C). On the basis of the assessment of primer utilization efficiency and product homogeneity, we chose an RNA construct with a 33-mer template (T33-1) and a 10-mer primer (P10) for catalytic complex assembly and subsequent structural study. To obtain the catalytic complex, we mixed purified nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 ( Figures S1 A and S1B) with the T33-1:P10 construct ( Figure 1 A). Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were supplied as the only nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates to allow the incorporation of a C-A-C-A tetranucleotide, resulting in an RdRP catalytic complex containing a 14-mer product (P14) ( Figure 1 A). This complex represents a post-translocated state after four NMP incorporation events, therefore representing the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP-RNA catalytic complex in action.
To investigate the mechanism of RDV-TP (remdesivir triphosphate) inhibition, we designed another 33-mer template (T33-7) and successfully obtained an RDV-MP-incorporated catalytic complex in the pre-translocated state ( Figure 1 B). Briefly, the identical C-A-C-A tetranucleotide was incorporated by the RdRP to form the P14-containing complex. After purification by anion exchange chromatography, the P14-containing complex sample was incubated with guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) and RDV-TP at 4°C for 30 min before being frozen for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data collection. The final structure showed a G-G-R-G tetranucleotide was further incorporated into the product RNA chain (corresponding to an 18-mer product or P18) ( Figures 1 B, S1 D, and S1E). The cryo-EM map signal on the 1′-cyano (1′-CN) group of the −1 nucleotide, the guanine base of the +1 nucleotide in the product strand are unambiguous to ensure the assignment of this pre-translocated P18-containing catalytic complex in which the incorporated RDV-MP (R) has been translocated to the −1 position, whereas the 3′-guanosine occupies the +1 position (see below for details).
Cryo-EM single-particle analysis results in two near-atomic-resolution structures of the polymerase catalytic complexes, the complex in a pre-translocated state at 2.93 Å ( Figure S2 ) and that in a post-translocated state at 3.26 Å ( Figure S3 ). The complexes in the two states share similar structure architecture. They both comprise the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and RNA template-product duplex that lies in the active site cleft of nsp12 ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The most notable difference is that, in the pre-translocated complex with a longer P18 product, the existing duplex RNA meets the N-terminal helical extension of nsp8-1 not far from the exit ( Figure 2 C). Analysis of the two bound nsp8 promoters resolved two distinct conformations in the pre-translocated complex ( Figure 2 D). The major difference between these two conformations is at the N-terminal helical extension. Unlike the subtle difference at the most N-terminal end of nsp8-1, the N-terminal extension of nsp8-2 shows an orientation change of ∼45 degrees ( Figure 2 D). In conformation II, which shows more structural rigidity, the two copies of nsp8 bind from two opposite sides of the RNA duplex as it exits ( Figure 2 D, right). Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along with the exiting RNA, forming a stable platform that might enable processive replication of the large coronavirus genome ( Figure 2 E). Meanwhile, in the pre-translocated complex, the downstream RNA is partially resolved and interacts with the fingers domain and the product strand, whereas the +2 template nucleotide is still base-paired ( Figure 3 A). The establishment of these interactions between the downstream RNA and other parts of the complex and the requirement for strand displacement at the immediate downstream might play a role in stabilizing or trapping of this complex, allowing a successful cryo-EM reconstruction.
Fourteen base pairs in the pre-translocated complex and nine base pairs in the post-translocated complex double-stranded template-product RNA helix gripped by the fingers-palm-thumb domains, and three base pairs of the downstream template (corresponding to positions +2 to +4) in the pre-translocated complex, are resolved in the EM structure ( Figure 3 A). Non-sequence-specific protein-RNA interactions are observed between the template-product RNA and nsp12. In particular, in the pre-translocated complex, N496, K500, S501, N507, and K577 from the fingers domain and Y595 from the palm domain directly participate in stabilizing the phosphate backbone of the template ( Figure 3 B), whereas R836, K849, and R858, experience a significant rotation of their side chains to coordinate the phosphate backbone of the product ( Figure 3 C). Interestingly, D499 in motif G from the fingers domain interacts with both the 5′-terminal base of the template and the phosphate backbone of the product, whereas R80 from nsp8 interacts with the downstream base-paired template ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Meanwhile, Y689 of the fingers domain interacts with the ribose 2′-OH groups of nucleotides at the −2 position from the template strand ( Figure 3 B).
Besides the establishment of the non-sequence-specific RNA interactions, two motifs of the RdRP undergo conformational changes in response to accommodate the template-product RNA ( Figure 4 A). A loop region (residues 682–686) within the RdRP catalytic motif B of the palm shows a dynamic interaction with RNA in both pre- and post-translocation states. It is “pushed” backward by the +1 to −2 template nucleotides with a maximum backbone shift of about 2.6 Å (residue A685) ( Figures 4 B and S5 A). This loop contains a glycine (G683) that is conserved in RNA-dependent polymerases ( Gong and Peersen, 2010 13. Gong, P. ∙ Peersen, O.B. Structural basis for active site closure by the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :22505-22510 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ) and exhibits dynamic features in both positive- and negative-strand RNA virus RdRPs ( Kouba et al., 2019; Sholders and Peersen, 2014 20. Kouba, T. ∙ Drncová, P. ∙ Cusack, S. Structural snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :460-470 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Sholders, A.J. ∙ Peersen, O.B. Distinct conformations of a putative translocation element in poliovirus polymerase J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426 :1407-1419 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). It participates in NTP ribose recognition and RdRP active site closure ( Shu and Gong, 2016 31. Shu, B. ∙ Gong, P. Structural basis of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalysis and translocation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E4005-E4014 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) and has been proposed to mediate RdRP translocation ( Sholders and Peersen, 2014 30. Sholders, A.J. ∙ Peersen, O.B. Distinct conformations of a putative translocation element in poliovirus polymerase J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426 :1407-1419 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the same time, on the opposite side of the template strand, motif G (D499–L514) on the fingers also exhibits interaction with the RNA backbone ( Figure 4 C). Although the map signal for this region is relatively weak and undefined in the post-translocation structure, as mentioned earlier in the structure of the pre-translocation state, the conformation of motif G and its interaction with the +1 template nucleotide via S501 backbone nitrogen are well resolved ( Figure 3 B). In a very recent study characterizing the role of motif G in EV71 RdRP translocation, the motif G residues equivalent to K500 and S501 were shown to play a critical role in restricting the +1-template nucleotide ( Wang et al., 2020 37. Wang, M. ∙ Li, R. ∙ Shu, B. ... Stringent control of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase translocation revealed by multiple intermediate structures Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2605 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). This restriction, on one hand, ensures precise positioning of the templating base for efficient NTP binding and catalysis, and on the other hand to control translocation by setting up a rate-limiting step ( Wang et al., 2020 37. Wang, M. ∙ Li, R. ∙ Shu, B. ... Stringent control of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase translocation revealed by multiple intermediate structures Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2605 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The interactions with RNA are manifested in broader conformational changes of the palm, fingers, and thumb domain of nsp12, which seem to be further propagated to the two copies of nsp8. Specifically, besides the C-terminal tail (residues 926–932) (C-tail) next to the RNA exit channel that points toward the active site in the apo state but flips out in the catalytic complexes, two α helices of the thumb domain are deflected 5–10 degrees to the outward of the complex in relation to the RNA ( Figure 4 D). What’s interesting is that, in the pre-translocation structure, the N-terminal helical domain of nsp8-1 lies on a notch formed at the top of these two helices and makes a conformational change in the 845–855 loop and stabilizes the 900–910 loop, which is missing in the apo and post-translocation structure ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Furthermore, the nsp8-2 N-terminal helix that lays on the fingers deflects by about 5 degrees ( Figure 4 F). In the pre-translocation structure, which has a longer RNA product, the most distal section of this helix appears to be able to switch between two particular conformations and interact with exiting RNA ( Figures 2 D and 2E).
The catalytic center of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 is constructed by seven conserved motifs from A to G ( Gao et al., 2020 11. Gao, Y. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from COVID-19 virus Science. 2020; 368 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (1090) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 A). In the pre-translocation structure, the base pair of cytosine and guanosine at the +1 position have an unequivocal cryo-EM map signal ( Figure 5 B), which is tightly coordinated by the interactions from several conserved residues. Specifically, the backbone nitrogen atom of S501 and the sidechain of V557, respectively, position the phosphate and base moieties of cytosine on the template ( Figure 5 A). The backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of S682 and the nitrogen atom of the K545 side chain jointly stabilize the base group of guanosine from both sides, whereas D623 stabilizes its ribose group via an interaction with the 3′ hydroxyl group ( Figure 5 B). Given that favipiravir is a guanine analog, we aligned favipiravir monophosphate onto the guanosine to pair with the cytosine at +1 position of template, on the basis of a superposition on their phosphate and ribose groups. Interestingly, the distance between the side-chain nitrogen atom of K545 and the carboxamide oxygen atom and exocyclic amide of favipiravir are both about 3 Å ( Figure 5 B).
RDV is a phosphoramidate prodrug of a 1′-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analog that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses ( Siegel et al., 2017 32. Siegel, D. ∙ Hui, H.C. ∙ Doerffler, E. ... Discovery and Synthesis of a Phosphoramidate Prodrug of a Pyrrolo[2,1-f][triazin-4-amino] Adenine C-Nucleoside (GS-5734) for the Treatment of Ebola and Emerging Viruses J. Med. Chem. 2017; 60 :1648-1661 Crossref Scopus (500) PubMed Google Scholar ). Its triphosphate form (RDV-TP) can be used as a substrate of several viral RdRP enzymes or complexes ( Agostini et al., 2018; Tchesnokov et al., 2019 2. Agostini, M.L. ∙ Andres, E.L. ∙ Sims, A.C. ... Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease MBio. 2018; Crossref Scopus (1029) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Tchesnokov, E.P. ∙ Feng, J.Y. ∙ Porter, D.P. ... Mechanism of Inhibition of Ebola Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Remdesivir Viruses. 2019; 11 :326 Crossref Scopus (451) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to classic chain terminators, inhibition of chain elongation is not observed immediately after the incorporated RDV monophosphate (RDV-MP) ( Jordan et al., 2018; Tchesnokov et al., 2019 19. Jordan, P.C. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Raynaud, P. ... Initiation, extension, and termination of RNA synthesis by a paramyxovirus polymerase PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1006889 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Tchesnokov, E.P. ∙ Feng, J.Y. ∙ Porter, D.P. ... Mechanism of Inhibition of Ebola Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Remdesivir Viruses. 2019; 11 :326 Crossref Scopus (451) PubMed Google Scholar ). Its 3′-OH group allows the nucleophilic in-line attack on the incoming NTP. Indeed, in the pre-translocation complex, the 2.9 Å well-resolved map signal on the 1′-cyano group of the −1 product nucleotide ensures the assignment of RDV-MP, which had been incorporated and translocated to the −1 position, whereas the 3′-guanosine occupied the +1 position ( Figures 5 A and 5D). In a previous enzyme kinetics analysis ( Gordon et al., 2020 14. Gordon, C.J. ∙ Tchesnokov, E.P. ∙ Woolner, E. ... Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with high potency J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 :6785-6797 Crossref Scopus (685) PubMed Google Scholar ), favorable reactivity for the RDV-TP over ATP and delayed chain termination at position i+3 (where i corresponds to the position of the first incorporated RDV-MP) are observed to be the key features of the mechanism of inhibition with SARS-CoV-2 RdRP complexes. When RdRP synthesis proceeds to the i+3 position, the first incorporated RDV-MP will be at position −3 or −4 for the pre- or post-translocated state, respectively. According to the previous molecular modeling analysis, the 1′-CN substituent of incorporated RDV-MP could encounter a steric clash from the sidechain of S861 and probably lead to a distortion of the positioning of the RNA, hampering translocation to the −4 position ( Gordon et al., 2020 14. Gordon, C.J. ∙ Tchesnokov, E.P. ∙ Woolner, E. ... Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with high potency J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 :6785-6797 Crossref Scopus (685) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the basis of the current 2.9 Å catalytic pre-translocated complex structure, if one aligns the incorporated RDV-MP onto the adenosine at the −4 position, the serine hydroxyl oxygen would be as close as 2 Å from the 1′-cyano nitrogen ( Figure 5 E).
To further dissect the RDV-TP inhibition mechanism and to test this steric clash hypothesis, we compared the behaviors of RDV-TP with ATP in our T33-1:P10-based assays and the WT RdRP, and we also compared an S861A mutant regarding the i+3-related product profiles ( Figure 6 ). We first compared the primer extension profiles between the CTP/ATP and CTP/RDV-TP combinations. It turned out that the latter combination led to both the regular 14-mer product (corresponding to the incorporation of a C-R-C-R tetranucleotide) and a misincorporation-derived 15-mer product. This misincorporation event likely arose from a C:R misincorporation given that this activity is greatly reduced when the RDV-TP concentration is lowered ( Figure 6 B, compare lanes 17–18 and 13–16) but not much affected by the variation of the CTP concentration ( Figure 6 B, compare lanes 27–28 and 23–26). We then compared the extension profiles between the CTP/ATP/GTP and CTP/RDV-TP/GTP combinations. For both the WT RdRP and the S861A mutant, the CTP/ATP/GTP combination led to the synthesis of the expected 16-mer product and a small amount of 17-mer product because of misincorporation, whereas the S861A mutant appeared to be more reactive ( Figure 6 C). As expected, the CTP/RDV-TP/GTP combination resulted in the production of a 15-mer product corresponding to the synthesis at the i+3 position, and the estimated fraction of termination (i.e., the fraction of 15-mer to 15-mer and longer products based on band intensities) values were 0.71–0.77 and 0.13–0.14 for low (20 μM) and high (300 μM) GTP concentrations at the 90-min reaction time point, respectively ( Figure 6 C, lane 57 versus 67 and 53 versus 63). This observation is consistent with the previous study showing the incoming NTP reduced the i+3 termination ( Gordon et al., 2020 14. Gordon, C.J. ∙ Tchesnokov, E.P. ∙ Woolner, E. ... Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with high potency J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 :6785-6797 Crossref Scopus (685) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared with the WT RdRP, the S861A mutant had a smaller fraction of i+3 termination at all tested GTP concentrations, providing valid support of the steric clash hypothesis ( Figure 6 C, compare lanes 52–57 to 72–77 and 62–67 to 82–87).

Section: Discussion

We have obtained two cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRP-RNA catalytic complex in both RDV-MP incorporated pre-translocation and stalled post-translocation states and provide a comprehensive view of the active site. This result is of significance for the design optimization of potential drug candidates, such as remdesivir and favipiravir. The N-terminalnidovirus RdRP-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain of RdRP in apo and the two catalytic states shows dramatic conformational changes, and a strong undefined signal appears in the vicinity of K73, R116, and D218 in the pre-translocation complex ( Figure S5 B). Clarifying these features might require further investigation.
The coronavirus polymerase complex is composed of RdRP nsp12 and its co-factors nsp7 and nsp8. However, the existing structures of the complexes to date ( Gao et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2020 11. Gao, Y. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from COVID-19 virus Science. 2020; 368 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (1090) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Yin, W. ∙ Mao, C. ∙ Luan, X. ... Structural basis for inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from SARS-CoV-2 by remdesivir Science. 2020; eabc1560 Crossref Scopus (858) PubMed Google Scholar ) have not revealed the complete nsp8. The functional role of the two co-factors has remained an enigma. Increased RNA synthesis efficiency associated with the simultaneous presence of nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 has been characterized on SARS-CoV-1 ( Subissi et al., 2014 33. Subissi, L. ∙ Posthuma, C.C. ∙ Collet, A. ... One severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein complex integrates processive RNA polymerase and exonuclease activities Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :E3900-E3909 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ). A similar phenomenon on SARS-CoV-2 was also observed under our primer extension assay setup ( Figure S6 ). In our work, we have revealed the overall structure of the two bound nsp8 molecules in different conformational states. The potential mechanism for promoting polymerase activity by stabilizing existing RNA through the interactions on their N-terminal helical extension is described. While this paper was under review, a study was posted as a pre-print reporting a cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP complex with a 24-base-pair (bp) template-primer RNA ( Hillen et al., 2020 16. Hillen, H.S. ∙ Kokic, G. ∙ Farnung, L. ... Structure of replicating SARS-CoV-2 polymerase bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is formed by three repetitive RNA pairs connected through palindromic GUAC sticky ends. Although that structure likely represents a pre-catalytic or pre-initiation state that has not gone through catalysis, it seems to represent a similar global architecture to what is observed in the conformation II of our pre-translocation complex. The observation of such a conformation as the dominant form in the presence of their longer RNA duplex is informative. This observation led us to consider that, with respect to nsp8-upstream RNA interactions, conformation II might be the dominant state during RNA processive elongation, rather than conformation I. Conformation I in our structure is therefore likely to be a transition state before the RNA products getting long enough to establish the elongation-mode interactions with nsp8.
nsp7 and nsp8 can form a “non-canonical primase” to generate RNA primers ( Imbert et al., 2006; te Velthuis et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2012 18. Imbert, I. ∙ Guillemot, J.C. ∙ Bourhis, J.M. ...

Subissi, L. ∙ Posthuma, C.C. ∙ Collet, A. ... One severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein complex integrates processive RNA polymerase and exonuclease activities Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 2019; Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). After reviewing our previous work on the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecameric primase complex structure of SARS-CoV-1 ( Zhai et al., 2005 41. Zhai, Y. ∙ Sun, F. ∙ Li, X. ... Insights into SARS-CoV transcription and replication from the structure of the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecamer Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12 :980-986 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that this pair of nsp7 and nsp8-1 have a similar relative position and conformation with one of the pairs in their hexadecameric complex ( Figures 7 A to 7C). The ring-shaped hexadecameric complex is believed to dissociate into two octamers “half-rings” after primer synthesis ( Li et al., 2010 22. Li, S. ∙ Zhao, Q. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... New nsp8 isoform suggests mechanism for tuning viral RNA synthesis Protein Cell. 2010; 1 :198-204 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). If we superimpose the “half-ring” on to the nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex and assume that the nucleic acid passes through the central pore of the primase enzyme during primer synthesis ( Zhai et al., 2005 41. Zhai, Y. ∙ Sun, F. ∙ Li, X. ... Insights into SARS-CoV transcription and replication from the structure of the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecamer Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12 :980-986 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ), we find that the substrate paths of the two are in a surprisingly close and parallel position ( Figure 7 D). Thus, there is the possibility of a fairly direct substrate channeling or “hand-over” between these two enzyme complexes. On the basis of this analysis, we propose a model for understanding the transition steps from the primase complex to the catalytic complex ( Figure 7 E).
Coronavirus replication and transcription are mediated by a replication-transcription complex (RTC) of which virus-encoded, nsps are the primary constituents. A broader spatiotemporal view of this complex viral replication-transcription mechanisms will help to develop antiviral drugs that interfere with this kernel process of viral replication. In addition to optimizing the inhibitor’s ability to target nsp12 for efficient incorporation into the RNA genome, one can also consider blocking the integrity of the polymerase complex, such as the interaction between nsp8 and nsp12, or the ability to evade or overcome the proofreading activity of the viral exoribonuclease (ExoN), such as β-d-N4-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) ( Agostini et al., 2019 3. Agostini, M.L. ∙ Pruijssers, A.J. ∙ Chappell, J.D. ... Small-Molecule Antiviral β-d- N 4 -Hydroxycytidine Inhibits a Proofreading-Intact Coronavirus with a High Genetic Barrier to Resistance J.

The cryo-EM maps and atomic models have been deposited at the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMD-30252, EMD-30275, EMD-30283 and EMD-30284) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 7BZF and PDB: 7C2K ). A list of software used in this study can be found in the Key Resources Table.
Proteins were obtained through recombinant expression in E. coli BL21(DE3).
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 (GenBank: MN_908947) gene was inserted into a pET22b vector possessing a C-terminal 10 × His tag. Full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 genes were respectively inserted into a pET28a vector with an N-terminal 6 × His tag. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). When bacterial cultures were grown in LB medium to an OD 600 of 0.6-0.8 at 37°C, growth temperature was reduced to 16°C followed by the addition of a final concentration of 0.5 mM IPTG to induce the expression. After overnight induction, the harvested cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol) with benzonase (Yeasen) and lysed by passage through a high-pressure homogenizer at 4°C. The lysate was centrifugated at 18000 rpm for 30 min to obtain supernatant containing recombinant protein, which was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The protein bound to the Ni-NTA column was eluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 300 mM imidazole and concentrated to load onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in gel filtration buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 and 4mM DTT). The collected protein fractions were concentrated to 5 mg/mL and stored at 4°C for further use.
Eleven template-primer RNA constructs (Table S1) were initially screened to identify sequences that could generate stalled nsp12/nsp7/nsp8-RNA catalytic complexes stable enough to survive an anion exchange chromatography purification. A construct comprising a 33-mer template (T33-1) and a 10-mer primer (P10) was chosen in complex assembly to generate a 14-mer product (P14)-containing catalytic complex for structural studies. The RNA templates were prepared by in vitro T7 RNA polymerase-glmS ribozyme-based approaches described previously ( Batey and Kieft, 2007; Gong and Peersen, 2010 4. Batey, R.T. ∙ Kieft, J.S. Improved native affinity purification of RNA RNA. 2007; 13 :1384-1389 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Gong, P. ∙ Peersen, O.B. Structural basis for active site closure by the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :22505-22510 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see below for more detail), and the P10 and an 8-mer primer (P8) was chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies). The T33-1:P10 construct was made with a 10% molar excess of P10 annealed to T33-1 via a 3-min incubation at 45°C followed slow cooling to room temperature (r.t.). For the P14-containing stalled catalytic complex assembly (post-translocation complex), a typical 1.5-mL reaction mixture containing 12 μM nsp12, 12 μM nsp7, 24 μM nsp8, 10 μM T33-1:P10, 300 μM CTP, and 300 μM ATP in a buffer of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was incubated at 25°C for 40-60 min. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in a Low-Salt buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT) and the catalytic complex was eluted with a linear gradient to 1 M NaCl. The pooled complex fractions were buffer exchanged to the Low-Salt buffer and concentrated to reach a concentration of 5 mg/mL for further cryo-EM experiments. To test the reactivity of the P14-containing complex, GTP or 3′-deoxy-GTP (3dGTP) was supplied at 300 μM to allow the synthesis of a 16-mer or 15-mer product, respectively. The RNA T33-7:P10 modified from T33-1:P10, a U substitution of A in the template, was designed for RDV-TP incorporation into the P14-containing complex (pre-translocation complex). The procedure for obtaining the P14-containing complex was the same as described above. The pooled complex fractions from the MonoQ column were buffer-exchanged to the Low-Salt buffer and concentrated to reach a concentration of 9 mg/mL. After the addition of 100 μM GTP and 100 μM RDV-TP, the complex was incubated at 4°C for 30min before conducting the cryo-EM experiment.
In the T33-1:P10-based primer-dependent polymerase assays for comparing the behaviors of RDV-TP and ATP, unless otherwise indicated, a typical 20 μL reaction mixture containing 6 μM WT nsp12 or its variant S861A, 6 μM nsp7, 12 μM nsp8, 4 μM T33-1:P10, and 300 μM each NTP, in a buffer of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT was incubated at 25°C for 20 and 90 min. The reaction mixture was quenched with an equal volume of stop solution (95% (vol./vol.) formamide, 20 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.02% (wt./vol.) bromphenol blue, and/or 0.02% (wt./vol.) xylene cyanol). A 33-mer DNA complementary to T33-1 was added to the quenched samples at a 4:1 or 3:1 molar ratio (DNA:RNA) to help release the RNA products from the template. RNA species were resolved by 20% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel electrophoresis and then visualized by staining with Stains-All (Sigma-Aldrich). Color images obtained by scanning the stained gels were converted to gray-scale images prior to quantitation by using ImageJ (version 1.50i, National Institute of Health, USA) ( Schneider et al., 2012 29. Schneider, Caroline ∙ Rasband, Wayne ∙ Eliceiri, Kevin NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (42378) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intensity-based fraction of 15-mer among 15- to 17-mer products was used to estimate the fraction of i+3 termination.
RNA templates were obtained by in vitro T7 RNA polymerase transcription using a pRAV23 plasmid (kindly supplied by Jeffrey S. Kieft) that contains a T7 promoter and a glmS ribozyme sequence in the transcribed region. The pRAV23 plasmid and synthetic DNAs that contain sequences to generate the target RNAs were used in PCR reactions to generate T7-promoter containing DNA constructs, which in turn serve as the template in 8-16 mL transcription reactions in a buffer (60 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 22 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM spermidine, 0.01% (vol./vol.) Triton X-100, and 15 mM DTT) containing 4 mM each NTP and 25 μg/mL T7 RNA polymerase. After 3.5 h, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 65°C for 3 min and slowly cooled to room temperature to facilitate the folding of the glmS ribozyme. To generate the ribozyme-cleaved RNA products, gluocoseamine-6-phosphate and NaCl were added to the mixture at final concentrations of 5 mM and 100 mM, respectively. The cleavage reactions were carried out at 42°C for 0.5–1 h before being quenched by an equal volume of gel loading buffer (10 M Urea, 1 × TBE, 0.02% (wt./vol.) xylene cyanol, and 0.02% (wt./vol.) bromphenol blue). The target RNAs were purified by 12% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel electrophoresis, excised from the gel, eluted using an Elu-Trap device (GE Healthcare), ethanol precipitated, dissolved in RNA annealing buffer (RAB) (50 mM NaCl, 5 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl 2 ), and stored at −80°C after a self-annealing process (a 3-min incubation at 95°C followed by snap cooling to minimize inter-molecular annealing).
The synthesis of remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP) was accomplished according to the established process ( Warren et al., 2016 38. Warren, T.K. ∙ Jordan, R. ∙ Lo, M.K. ... Therapeutic efficacy of the small molecule GS-5734 against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys Nature. 2016; 531 :381-385 Crossref Scopus (1145) PubMed Google Scholar ). To a suspension of GS-441524 (300 mg, 1.03 mmol) (CAS 1191237-69-0, Catalog Number: T7222, Topscience, China) in PO(OMe) 3 (5 mL) at 0°C was added POCl 3 (236 mg, 1.54 mmol), the solution became slowly clear. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 2 h, and a suspension of pyrophosphate tributylamine salts (844 mg, 1.54 mmol) in CH 3 CN (3 mL) was added followed by the addition of Bu 3 N (762 mg, 4.12 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 2 h, the reaction was monitored by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), quenched by the addition of triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (1 M, 12 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and then triethylamine (1 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred an additional 30 min and washed three times with EtOAc (20 mL × 3). The aqueous phase was purified by Pre-HPLC to afford the product RDV-TP salt (205 mg, 24%, 3.0 eq triethylamonium) as an off-white solid.
In total, 3 μL of protein-RNA complex solution at 5 mg/mL (added with 0.025% DDM) was applied onto an H 2 /O 2 glow-discharged, 200-mesh Quantifoil R0.6/1.0 grid (Quantifoil, Micro Tools GmbH, Germany). The grid was then blotted for 3.0 s with a blot force of 0 at 8°C and 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cryo-EM data were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, USA). Images were recorded at EFTEM with a 165000 × magnification and calibrated super-resolution pixel size 0.41 Å/pixel. The exposure time was set to 5 s with a total accumulated dose of 60 electrons per Å 2 . All images were automatically recorded using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 23. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3088) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the sample of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA post-translocated catalytic complex, a total of 6,826 images were collected with a defocus range from 1.0 μm to 1.8 μm. For the sample of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA pre-translocated catalytic complex, a total of 6,524 images were collected with a defocus range from 1.0 μm to 2.0 μm. Statistics for data collection and refinement are in Table S2.
All dose-fractioned images were motion-corrected and dose-weighted by MotionCorr2 software ( Zheng et al., 2017 42. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ) and their contrast transfer functions were estimated by cryoSPARC patch CTF estimation ( Punjani et al., 2017 27. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3664) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the dataset of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA post-translocated catalytic complex, a total of 1,235,162 particles were auto-picked using blob picker and extracted with a box size of 300 pixels in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 27. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3664) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following 2D, 3D classifications, and refinements were all performed in cryoSPARC. 487,866 particles were selected after two rounds of 2D classification. 100,000 particles were used to do Ab-Initio reconstruction in four classes, and then these four classes were used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous refinement with all selected particles, with 119,662 particles converged into nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA class and 183,165 particles converged into nsp12-nsp8-RNA class. Next, both particle sets were used to perform non-uniform refinement, yielding a resolution of 3.26 Å and 3.60 Å, respectively. For the dataset of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA pre-translocated catalytic complex, a total of 1,330,896 particles were auto-picked using the templates selected from the previous 2D classes and extracted with a box size of 320 pixels in cryoSPARC. 804,943 particles were selected after 2D classification. Two rounds of Ab-Initio reconstruction and heterogeneous refinement were performed, with 214,419 particles converged into nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA class. After non-uniform refinement, the resolution reached 2.93 Å. Then, this particle set was imported into RELION-3.03 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 44. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2803) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform local 3D classification and two classes of different conformations could be distinguished. After non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC, the final resolution of conformation I reached 3.03 Å (65463 particles) while that of conformation II reached 3.12 Å (37696 particles). Local resolution estimation was performed using Resmap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 21. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1285) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To build the two structures of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA complex, the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex (PDB: 7BTF ) was placed and rigid-body fitted into the cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 26. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32501) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RNA model was manually built in Coot 0.8 ( Emsley et al., 2010 10. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19616) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the guidance of the cryo-EM map, and overall real-space refinement was performed using Phenix 1.9 ( Afonine et al., 2012 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Echols, N. ... Towards automated crystallographic structure refinement with phenix.refine Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2012; 68 :352-367 Crossref Scopus (3896) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data validation statistics are shown in Table S2.
Figures of molecular structures were generated using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, LLC.) ( DeLano, 2010 9. DeLano, W. The PyMOL molecular graphics system Schrödinger, LLC, New York, 2010 Google Scholar ) and UCSF ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 12. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ...

Quantification and statistical analyses employed in this publication pertain to the analysis on electron microscopy data and the determination of structures by electron microscopy, which are integral parts of existing algorithms and software used. Resolution estimations of cryo-EM density maps are based on the 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion ( Chen et al., 2013; Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 5. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ...

Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1558) PubMed Google Scholar ). No new methods were used to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach.
