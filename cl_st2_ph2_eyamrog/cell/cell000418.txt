Title: Human population history at the crossroads of East and Southeast Asia since 11,000 years ago


Abstract: Summary

Past human genetic diversity and migration between southern China and Southeast Asia have not been well characterized, in part due to poor preservation of ancient DNA in hot and humid regions. We sequenced 31 ancient genomes from southern China (Guangxi and Fujian), including two ∼12,000- to 10,000-year-old individuals representing the oldest humans sequenced from southern China. We discovered a deeply diverged East Asian ancestry in the Guangxi region that persisted until at least 6,000 years ago. We found that ∼9,000- to 6,000-year-old Guangxi populations were a mixture of local ancestry, southern ancestry previously sampled in Fujian, and deep Asian ancestry related to Southeast Asian Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers, showing broad admixture in the region predating the appearance of farming. Historical Guangxi populations dating to ∼1,500 to 500 years ago are closely related to Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien speakers. Our results show heavy interactions among three distinct ancestries at the crossroads of East and Southeast Asia.

Section: Introduction

Modern humans have a long history of occupation in East and Southeast Asia. Recent studies sampling ancient human DNA have revealed distinct demographic patterns in Southeast Asia and southern China ( Lipson et al., 2018 37. Lipson, M. ∙ Cheronet, O. ∙ Mallick, S. ...

McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ning et al., 2020 54. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Southeast Asia, ∼8,000- to 4,000-year-old Southeast Asian Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers possessed deeply diverged Asian ancestry (denoted Hòabìnhian ancestry, since it was first detected in Hòabìnhian-related samples; see Box 1 ) ( Lipson et al., 2018 37. Lipson, M. ∙ Cheronet, O. ∙ Mallick, S. ... Ancient genomes document multiple waves of migration in Southeast Asian prehistory Science. 2018; 361 :92-95 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ; McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the first Southeast Asian farmers beginning ∼4,000 years ago show a mixture of ancestry associated with present-day southern Chinese populations and deeply diverged Hòabìnhians. In southern China, ∼9,000- to 4,000-year-old individuals from Fujian province show ancestry distinct from that found in northern China, but not as deeply diverged as Hòabìnhian ancestry. This ancestry (denoted Fujian ancestry, since it was first detected in Fujian; see Box 1 ) is found in partial amounts in present-day southern Chinese populations and is closely associated with ancestry found in today’s Austronesians, a seafaring population that migrated away from mainland Asia several thousand years ago ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings show that using ancient DNA (aDNA) techniques to examine ancestral populations and early population dynamics (especially before the transition to farming) is key for a better understanding of past population history.
Anthropological and archeological evidence also highlights demographic complexity in East and Southeast Asia. Surveys of material culture indicate that the culture associated with Hòabìnhian ancestry may have also been found in southern China ( Hung et al., 2017 26. Hung, H.-c. ∙ Chi, Z. ∙ Matsumura, H. ...

Comparisons of skeletal morphology from prehistoric humans along the border of southern China and Southeast Asia show patterns suggestive of deep ancestry unlike that observed in present-day East and Southeast Asians ( Matsumura et al., 2019 47. Matsumura, H. ∙ Hung, H.C. ∙ Higham, C. ... Craniometrics Reveal “Two Layers” of Prehistoric Human Dispersal in Eastern Eurasia Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :1451 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). One comparative archaeological study ( Zhang and Hung, 2008 85. Zhang, C. ∙ Hung, H.-c. The hunter-gatherer groups in southern China and its adjacent regions during the Neolithic Kaoguxue Yanjiu, 2008 415-434 Google Scholar ) suggested that in southern China, there were two different cultural traditions (one predominantly in coastal southern China and nearby islands and another in the region bordering Vietnam) mirroring the two distinct genetic patterns observed in ancient individuals from Southeast Asia and southern China ( Lipson et al., 2018 37. Lipson, M. ∙ Cheronet, O. ∙ Mallick, S. ... Ancient genomes document multiple waves of migration in Southeast Asian prehistory Science. 2018; 361 :92-95 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ; McColl et al., 2018 48.

Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Despite more clarity on East and Southeast Asian history, regions like Guangxi, a province in southern China bordering Vietnam, show that population history across southern China and Southeast Asia is still not well established. In Guangxi, an individual from a >10,000-year-old cave site (Longlin) was found to possess cranial morphology with a mix of archaic and modern features ( Curnoe et al., 2012 9. Curnoe, D. ∙ Xueping, J. ∙ Herries, A.I. ... Human remains from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition of southwest China suggest a complex evolutionary history for East Asians PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e31918 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), which suggested a possible ancestry similar to or deeper than Hòabìnhian ancestry, a pattern not observed in ancient East and Southeast Asians to date. Though Hòabìnhian-related material culture can be found in other parts of southern China ( Hung et al., 2017 26. Hung, H.-c. ∙ Chi, Z. ∙ Matsumura, H. ... Neolithic Transition in Guangxi: A Long Development of Hunting-Gathering Society in Southern China Biol.-anthropological studies of early Holocene hunter-gatherer sites at Huiyaotian and Liyupo in Guangxi, China Tokyo National Museum of Nature and Science, 2017; 205-228 Google Scholar ; Institute of Archaeology Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 2003 27.

Ji, X. ∙ Kuman, K. ∙ Clarke, R.J. ... The oldest Hoabinhian technocomplex in Asia (43.5 ka) at Xiaodong rockshelter, Yunnan Province, southwest China Quat. Int. 2016; 400 :166-174 Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar ), Hòabìnhian ancestry has yet to be found in any ancient human outside Southeast Asia. Populations today in Guangxi are Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien speakers ( Wang et al., 2021 80. Wang, C.-C. ∙ Yeh, H.-Y. ∙ Popov, A.N. ... Genomic insights into the formation of human populations in East Asia Nature. 2021; 591 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ), who possess a mix of Fujian and northern Chinese ancestry ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite Guangxi’s central location bridging southern China and Southeast Asia, aDNA techniques have not been applied to ancient humans in this region, largely due to the difficulties presented by low preservation of aDNA in hot and humid regions. Despite this sampling challenge, we surveyed ancient humans in the Guangxi region over the last 11,000 years to investigate (1) what role deeply divergent ancestries played in the region, particularly with regard to the Longlin specimen; (2) whether Hòabìnhian and Fujian ancestries extended to this region and, if so, how they interacted with each other; and (3) how past humans in this region contributed to present-day populations.

Section: Results

To address these questions, we screened 170 specimens from 30 sites in Guangxi ( Table S1 ). Despite the difficulty of retrieving aDNA in southern regions, we successfully obtained genomic material from 30 individuals from Guangxi with radiocarbon dates ranging from 10,686 to 294 calibrated years before present (cal BP; “BP” is before 1950 AD, Table 1 ; Table S1 ; Figures 1 A and 1B), including from a specimen excavated at Longlin cave who possessed both archaic and modern cranial features ( Curnoe et al., 2012 9. Curnoe, D. ∙ Xueping, J. ∙ Herries, A.I. ... Human remains from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition of southwest China suggest a complex evolutionary history for East Asians PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e31918 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 10.

We also obtained genomic data from an additional individual (Qihe3; 11,747–11,356 cal BP) from the Qihe cave site in Fujian, China ( Wu et al., 2014 81. Wu, X. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Li, S. ... The early Neolithic human skull from Qihe Cave, Zhangping, Fujian Acta Anthropol Sinica. 2014; 33 :448-459 Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Longlin and Qihe3 date to ∼12,000–10,000 years ago, allowing a look into the diversity of East Asia at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Collectively, we find that the aDNA sampled from the Guangxi region reveals a genetic history unlike that observed in other regions, including Southeast Asia and Fujian in southern China.
We used large-scale nuclear aDNA capture techniques ( Haak et al., 2015 24. Haak, W. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe Nature. 2015; 522 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ) to enrich for endogenous DNA at 1.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ( Fu et al., 2015 19. Fu, Q. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ∙ Moldovan, O.T. ... An early modern human from Romania with a recent Neanderthal ancestor Nature. 2015; 524 :216-219 Crossref Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ). To ensure SNPs were correctly called for each individual, we first identified characteristic aDNA damage signatures suggesting the presence of endogenous DNA ( Briggs et al., 2007 6. Briggs, A.W. ∙ Stenzel, U. ∙ Johnson, P.L.F. ... Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :14616-14621 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, we estimated modern human contamination rates for each sample, using all fragments from samples with ≤3% contamination. Three samples showed modern human mtDNA contamination levels above 3% ( Table 1 ). One of these, identified as male, showed negligible levels of contamination for nuclear DNA (2.9%), so we used all fragments for subsequent analyses. The other two, identified as female, could not be assessed for nuclear DNA contamination, so we restricted our downstream analyses to only DNA fragments that possessed a characteristic aDNA damage signature ( Fu et al., 2013a 16. Fu, Q. ∙ Meyer, M. ∙ Gao, X. ... DNA analysis of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave, China Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :2223-2227 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ; Korneliussen et al., 2014 32. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (1561) PubMed Google Scholar ). In total, we obtained genetic information from 31 individuals sequenced to between 0.01- and 4.06-fold coverage for the 1.2 million targeted SNPs ( Table 1 ).
We first performed a kinship analysis to test whether any samples were related to each other. Of the 30 Guangxi individuals sequenced, seven sets of close familial relationships (first and second degree) were found. For each of these sets, we retained the individual with the highest SNP count ( Table S1 ), resulting in 23 unrelated individuals for population genetic analysis. For these 23 unrelated Guangxi individuals, we used the results from principal-component ( Patterson et al., 2006 55. Patterson, N. ∙ Price, A.L. ∙ Reich, D. Population structure and eigenanalysis PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e190 Crossref Scopus (3509) PubMed Google Scholar ) (principal-component analysis [PCA]; Figure 1 C), outgroup- f 3 ( Patterson et al., 2012 56. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1550) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A), f 4 -statistic ( Patterson et al., 2012 56. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1550) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ADMIXTURE ( Alexander et al., 2009 1. Alexander, D.H. ∙ Novembre, J. ∙ Lange, K. Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1655-1664 Crossref Scopus (5468) PubMed Google Scholar ) analyses to separate them into nine groups ( Figures 1 A and 1B; see STAR Methods ). Qihe3 from Fujian clusters genetically with a previously published individual from the same site ( Figure S1 D; see STAR Methods ).
The oldest Guangxi individual sampled in this study, Longlin (10,686–10,439 cal BP, Laomaocao cave, Guangxi, China), possesses a cranial morphology with a mix of archaic and early modern human features. Longlin’s genetic profile, however, falls well within the genetic diversity found in modern human populations from Asia and with similar levels of archaic ancestry as that observed in East Asians ( Table S2 ).
Comparisons to 9,000- to 4,000-year-old individuals sampled in China ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) show that Longlin is not closely related to presently sampled East Asians. In an outgroup- f 3 analysis, Longlin shares little genetic similarity with ancient humans who are closely related to present-day East Asians ( Figure S1 D), namely, 9,500- to 7,700-year-old Shandong populations in northern China (Shandong ancestry; Box 1 ) and 8,400- to 7,600-year-old Fujian populations from southern China (Fujian ancestry) ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Shandong ( EN_SD ) and Fujian ( EN_FJ ) populations in fact share a closer relationship to each other than to Longlin, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, EN_SD/EN_FJ; Longlin, EN_SD/EN_FJ) > 0 (3.2 < Z < 14.4; Table S2 ), and neither population shares excess affinity with Longlin, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; EN_SD, EN_FJ) ∼ 0 (−2.1 < Z < 2.3; Table S2 ). This suggests that the lineage to which Longlin belongs branched prior to the separation of Shandong and Fujian ancestries in the north and south, respectively. After modeling the phylogenetic relationship between Longlin and Neolithic East Asians with both Admixture Graph and Treemix analyses ( Figures 2 A and 2B; see STAR Methods ), we find further support for scenarios whereby Longlin is an outgroup to northern and southern East Asian ancestries represented by the Shandong and Fujian populations.
To explore how deeply diverged Longlin is from East Asians, we compared Longlin and Neolithic East Asians to other individuals with deeply diverged Asian ancestries (“deep Asians”; see Box 1 ), including the ∼40,000-year-old Tianyuan ( Fu et al., 2013a 16. Fu, Q. ∙ Meyer, M. ∙ Gao, X. ... DNA analysis of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave, China Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :2223-2227 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2017 83. Yang, M.A. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Theunert, C. ... 40,000-year-old individual from Asia provides insight into early population structure in Eurasia Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :3202-3208.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), present-day Papuans from Papua New Guinea ( Mallick et al., 2016 41. Mallick, S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Lipson, M. ... The Simons Genome Diversity Project: 300 genomes from 142 diverse populations Nature. 2016; 538 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ), Onge from the Andamanese Islands ( Mallick et al., 2016 41. Mallick, S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Lipson, M. ... The Simons Genome Diversity Project: 300 genomes from 142 diverse populations Nature. 2016; 538 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ), and an ∼8,000-year-old Hòabìnhian from Southeast Asia ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). We find that Longlin is more closely related to the Shandong and Fujian populations than to any of the deeply diverging Asian ancestries, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; EN_SD/EN_FJ, Deep Asians) < 0 (−12.8 < Z < −2.4; Table S2 ) and f 4 (Mbuti, EN_SD/EN_FJ; Longlin, Deep Asians) < 0 (−13.1 < Z < −2.7; Table S2 ). Our genetic analyses show Longlin to be an offshoot of the East Asian branch of modern humans, with no close relationship to more deeply diverged Asian ancestries.
An ∼2,700-year-old individual from Japan associated with the Jōmon culture, Ikawazu, shows a similar pattern to East Asians and deeply diverged Asians as observed for Longlin ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ikawazu and Longlin share a closer relationship to each other than either share with deeply diverged Asians, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin/Ikawazu; Ikawazu/Longlin, Deep Asians) < 0 (−7.3 < Z < −3.4; Table S2 ). To assess who is more closely related to East Asians, we compared Ikawazu and Longlin to Shandong and Fujian populations (see STAR Methods ). In an f 4 analysis, we find that Shandong and Fujian populations are similarly related to Longlin and Ikawazu, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, EN_SD/EN_FJ; Longlin, Ikawazu) ∼ 0 (0.5 < Z < 2.2; Table S2 ), and both have connections to Shandong and Fujian populations not found in the other individual, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; Ikawazu, EN_SD/EN_FJ) > 0 (2.4 < Z < 5.2; Table S2 ) and f 4 (Mbuti, Ikawazu; Longlin, EN_SD/EN_FJ) > 0 (3.1 < Z < 6.4, Table S2 ). These patterns suggest that Longlin, Ikawazu, and Neolithic East Asians likely separated from each other at about the same time.
We thus find that Longlin’s ancestry (hereafter referred to as Guangxi ancestry) differs from both Fujian and Hòabìnhian ancestries, the two previous ancestries observed in the region encompassed by southern China and Southeast Asia. Similar to the Jōmon ancestry found in Ikawazu in Japan, Guangxi ancestry is more closely related to East Asian ancestry (e.g., Fujian and Shandong) than deeply diverging Asian ancestry (e.g., Hòabìnhian). However, unlike Ikawazu, Longlin was not geographically isolated from other mainland East Asians. These patterns indicate that the genetic diversity in Asia 11,000 years ago was higher than in more recent periods of human history.
We observed Guangxi ancestry in an ∼11,000-year-old human, so we next examined whether younger populations from the region also carried Guangxi ancestry. We recovered genome-wide data from two individuals (Dushan and Baojianshan) from Guangxi dating to ∼9,000–6,400 BP. If Dushan, a male individual directly dating to 8,974 –8,593 cal BP, is a descendent of a population more closely related to northern and southern East Asians than Longlin, then we would expect that f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; Dushan, East Asians) ∼ 0. Instead, we observed that relative to some East Asians from Siberia ( Sikora et al., 2019 76. Sikora, M. ∙ Pitulko, V.V. ∙ Sousa, V.C. ... The population history of northeastern Siberia since the Pleistocene Nature. 2019; 570 :182-188 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Fujian ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; Dushan, DevilsCave_N/Qihe) < 0 ( Z = −3.7/−3.3; Figure 2 C; Table S2 ), indicating the presence of a genetic connection between Longlin and Dushan. When we compared Longlin to ancient East and Southeast Asians in an outgroup f 3 -analysis, i.e., f 3 (Mbuti; Longlin, X) , the highest value observed was for Dushan ( Figures S1 B and S1D), demonstrating that Longlin shares the most genetic similarity with Dushan. These patterns suggest that Guangxi ancestry is present in Dushan.
However, rather than Dushan possessing solely Guangxi ancestry, outgroup f 3 analysis with Dushan shows that Dushan shares high genetic similarity to Fujian populations and Southeast Asian farmers, a pattern not observed for Longlin ( Figure S1 D). Phylogenetic analyses allowing migration events ( Figures 2 A and 2B) consistently model Dushan as a mixture of two sources, one related to Longlin (17%) and one related to a Fujian population (Qihe, 83%). f 4 analysis supports that Dushan shares a connection with a population of Fujian ancestry relative to Siberian-related northern East Asians and Shandong populations ( Box 1 ), i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan; EN_FJ, Siberian-related northern East Asians) < 0 (−5.8 < Z < −2.1) and f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan; Liangdao1, EN_SD) < 0 (−3.1 < Z < −1.7; Table S2 ). The genetic patterns observed for Dushan suggest that by around 9,000 BP, gene flow between populations carrying Guangxi ancestry and Fujian ancestry was occurring, resulting in admixed populations possessing a mixed Guangxi-Fujian ancestry.
Given the increased allele sharing between Dushan and populations carrying Fujian ancestry ( Figure 2 B), we next examined whether the admixed Guangxi-Fujian ancestry impacted the Fujian region. We found that Dushan shows more affinity to Late Fujian populations (grouped set of Xitoucun, Tanshishan) relative to Early Fujian populations (grouped set of Qihe, Qihe3, Liangdao1/2), i.e., we observed that f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan, LN_FJ, EN_FJ) < 0 ( Z = −5.1). This pattern persisted for transversions only ( Z = −3.2). In an expanded analysis keeping individuals from different archaeological sites separate, we assessed affinity to Dushan relative to the 12,000-year-old Qihe3 individual, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan; X, Qihe3) (see Figures 2 D and S2 ; see STAR Methods ). The affinity to Dushan persisted not only for the Late Fujian populations dating to 4,100–2,000 years ago (Xitoucun and Tanshishan, Z = −4.5/−3.7) but also 1,900- to 1,100-year-old Taiwan islanders (Taiwan_Hanben, Z = −3.9, Figures 2 D, S2 A, and S2B), a pattern that remained consistent after we applied a post hoc Benjamini-Hochberg correction (−3.8 < Z < −3.3; see STAR Methods ). We also observed the same Dushan affinity in 4,100–2,000-year-old Southeast Asian populations from Vietnam (Man_Bac and Nui_Nap, Z = −3.1) and 1,500-year-old populations from Guangxi (BaBanQinCen, Z = −4.2; Figures 2 D, S2 A, and S2B). With the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, the ancient Southeast Asian populations no longer showed a significant affinity, but BaBanQinCen did. Lastly, we found that for transversions only, the Dushan affinity only persisted for Xitoucun. Overall, these patterns indicate that ancestry related to Dushan, perhaps an admixed Guangxi-Fujian ancestry, played a prominent role in southern China’s prehistory.
An admixed Guangxi-Fujian ancestry seems to persist for a couple thousand years in Guangxi, based on genetic patterns found for a female individual from Baojianshan who was found in an archaeological layer dated to between 8,300 and 6,400 years ago (see STAR Methods ). Like Dushan, Baojianshan shares the highest genetic similarity with Fujian populations and Southeast Asian farmers ( Figure S1 D). Baojianshan also shares more alleles with Dushan relative to both Shandong and Fujian populations, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Baojianshan; Dushan, northern East Asians) < 0 (−6.7 < Z < −2.8) and f 4 (Mbuti, Baojianshan; Dushan, Qihe/Qihe3) < 0 (−3.2 < Z < −2.4; Table S2 ).
While Baojianshan shares ancestry with Dushan, unlike Dushan and other prehistoric Guangxi individuals, Baojianshan also shares alleles with the deeply diverged Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers of Southeast Asia ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an f 4 analysis, a Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherer shows a connection to Baojianshan relative to northern East Asians that is not observed for Longlin and Dushan ( Figure 2 E), i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Hòabìnhian; Baojianshan , DevilsCave_N) < 0 ( Z = −3.2), while f 4 (Mbuti, Hòabìnhian; Longlin/Dushan , DevilsCave_N) ∼ 0 (−1.7 < Z < 0.4; Table S2 ). When we estimated admixture proportions with qpAdm (see STAR Methods ), we observed that Baojianshan can be modeled as a mixture of 72.3% Dushan-related ancestry and 27.7% Hòabìnhian-related ancestry ( Table S3 ), with similar proportions estimated using qpGraph analysis ( Figure 2 B). In a Treemix analysis allowing migration events (see STAR Methods ), Baojianshan clusters with Dushan, sharing a migration event from the Longlin branch, and additionally experiences migration from Hòabìnhians ( Figure 2 A). Thus, Fujian and Hòabìnhian ancestry are both found in the Guangxi region by 8,300–6,400 years ago, and collectively, all three southern ancestries can be found in admixed form in the Guangxi region through Baojianshan.
From ∼9,000 to 6,400 years ago, admixture played a prominent role in prehistoric populations along the border of southern China and Southeast Asia. Dushan belonged to a population that possessed a mixture of Guangxi and Fujian ancestry, while Baojianshan is similar to Dushan but additionally shares Hòabìnhian ancestry. These patterns support that Hòabìnhian ancestry extended into southern China, as has been suggested from study of material culture at some southern Chinese archaeological sites ( Ji et al., 2016 30. Ji, X. ∙ Kuman, K. ∙ Clarke, R.J. ... The oldest Hoabinhian technocomplex in Asia (43.5 ka) at Xiaodong rockshelter, Yunnan Province, southwest China Quat. Int. 2016; 400 :166-174 Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar ). However, these patterns highlight that neither Hòabìnhian nor Fujian ancestry is sufficient to describe the populations that existed along the border of southern China and Southeast Asia. Guangxi ancestry persisted in partial amounts until at least 6,400 years ago, and ancestry associated with Dushan likely influenced prehistoric populations outside of the Guangxi region as well. Our findings show that the prehistoric period from 9,000 to 6,400 years ago is replete with admixed populations containing different levels of each of the southern ancestries. The timing and archaeological associations of these admixed populations suggest that admixture profoundly influenced the human landscape in southern China and Southeast Asia well before the advance of farming cultures such as those that were sampled in Southeast Asia ∼4,000 years ago ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Guangxi, these admixed individuals are not closely related to Longlin, a pattern that contrasts greatly with that observed in Fujian ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) around the same time span, where Late Neolithic Fujian populations show a close genetic relationship to Early Neolithic Fujian populations.
With sampling in Guangxi from 1,500 to 500 years ago, we lastly assessed what role, if any, the three southern ancestries played in the historical period. We found that historical Guangxi populations do not cluster with prehistoric populations in a PCA ( Figure 1 C). Instead, the majority of historical individuals dating to ∼1,500 years ago share a similar genetic profile, forming a tight cluster and overlapping with Tai-Kadai speakers ( Figures 1 C and S1 D). However, the ∼500-year-old GaoHuaHua population is distinct from the ∼1,500-year-old cluster, falling near Hmong-Mien speakers both in PCA ( Figure 1 C) and in outgroup- f 3 analyses ( Figure S3 A). To directly compare their relationships with present-day populations, we calculated f 4 (Mbuti, present-day East Asians; 1500BP Guangxi, 500BP Guangxi) and showed that Hmong-Mien speakers always show a significant affinity to the ∼500-year-old GaoHuaHua population ( Figure 3 A). All historical Guangxi populations were sampled from cave burial sites (see STAR Methods ). Based on the inscription and coffin typology, cave burials in Guangxi were believed to belong to ancestors of the Zhuang (Tai-Kadai speakers) ( Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum, 1991 23. Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum Survey and Research on Cliff Burials of the Left and Right River Valleys in Guangxi [in Chinese] Jianghan Archaeol. 1991; 3 :28-36 Google Scholar ). However, cave burials where the ∼500-year-old GaoHuaHua are sampled have been hypothesized to be connected to Miao-Yao populations (Hmong-Mien speakers) ( Zhou, 1991 88. Zhou, J. Discussion on the Cave Burial in Guangxi [in Chinese] Guangxi Wenwu. 1991; 2 Google Scholar ). Our genetic analyses suggest that populations in Guangxi at these two periods are indeed genetically very distinct and belong to different populations, as suggested previously ( Peng, 2001 57. Peng, C. Preliminary study on early cave burials in Guangxi [in Chinese] Guangxi Ethnic Studies, 2001 84-90 Google Scholar ). Thus, assuming these populations were the ones who ultimately contributed to present-day Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien groups in Guangxi, we find high genetic structure by at least 500 years ago.
We further explored the genetic structure of historical Guangxi populations using qpAdm to model mixture proportions from different source ancestries. We found historical Guangxi populations can be modeled as a mixture of 58.2%–90.6% Dushan-related (or Qihe3-related) ancestry, with 9.4%–41.8% northern-East-Asian-related ancestry (see STAR Methods ). For all populations but BaBanQinCen, we do not observe any significant signal of deep ancestry associated with Dushan ( Figure 2 D), which suggests that the southern ancestry found in these historical Guangxi populations is closely related to Fujian ancestry.
Similar to present-day southern East Asians ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), historical Guangxi populations since ∼1,500 years ago also show admixture from northern East Asians. We further compared previously published ancient populations from different areas in northern East Asia to test which ancestries had the strongest influence on historical Guangxi populations ( Ning et al., 2020 54. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sikora et al., 2019 76. Sikora, M. ∙ Pitulko, V.V. ∙ Sousa, V.C. ... The population history of northeastern Siberia since the Pleistocene Nature. 2019; 570 :182-188 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2021 80. Wang, C.-C. ∙ Yeh, H.-Y. ∙ Popov, A.N. ... Genomic insights into the formation of human populations in East Asia Nature. 2021; 591 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an outgroup- f 3 analysis, historical Guangxi populations show the closest genetic affinity with ancient populations found near the Lower Yellow River, e.g., Shandong populations dating to 9,500–7,900 BP ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Bianbian, Xiaojingshan) and Central Plains populations dating to 4,225–2,000 BP ( Ning et al., 2020 54. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) (YR_LN, YR_LBIA; Figure 3 B). The genetic affinity between Guangxi and the ∼7,900 BP Xiaojingshan persisted from the earliest historical Guangxi group BaBanQinCen (maximum date 1,688 BP), i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, BaBanQinCen; large panel of northern East Asians, Xiaojingshan) > 0 (2.1 < Z < 10.6; Table S2 ) to the youngest Guangxi population sampled, the GaoHuaHua (maximum date 513 BP, 2.5 < Z < 9.2; Table S2 ). Thus, the northern influence found in historical Guangxi populations from 1,500 to 500 years ago was most closely related to Shandong ancestry dating to 9,500–7,700 years ago.

Section: Discussion

Our analysis of individuals spanning ∼11,000–6,000 years ago from the Guangxi region of southern China reveals a previously unsampled genetic lineage that is deeply diverged from East Asians. This lineage, best represented by the ∼11,000-year-old Longlin individual, acts as an outgroup to the northern and southern East Asian ancestries present in Shandong and Fujian ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealing that deep branching in East Asian lineages is found not only in isolated regions such as the Japanese archipelago ( Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al., 2019 31. Kanzawa-Kiriyama, H. ∙ Jinam, T.A. ∙ Kawai, Y. ... Late Jomon male and female genome sequences from the Funadomari site in Hokkaido, Japan Anthropol. Sci. 2019; 127 :83-108 Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar ; McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also in mainland East Asia. Another ∼12,000-year-old individual was sampled from the Fujian region along China’s southern coast who, unlike Longlin, shows Fujian ancestry ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these two individuals show that ∼12,000–10,000 years ago, southern China was characterized by at least two highly diverse human populations. However, while Fujian-related ancestry (represented by Qihe3) existed in the Fujian region from ∼12,000 to 4,000 years ago, this pattern did not extend to the Guangxi region.
More recent sampling shows that population continuity was not a feature of the Guangxi region, and gene flow played a formative role ∼9,000–6,400 years ago. The ∼9,000-year-old Dushan is best characterized as a mixture of Fujian and Guangxi ancestry, and ancestry related to Dushan appears later in a Fujian population (Xitoucun) dating to ∼4,000 years ago ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, Baojianshan, who dates between 8,300 and 6,400 years ago, is a mixture of those two ancestries and additionally Hòabìnhian ancestry, a deeply diverged Asian ancestry that was widespread in Southeast Asia prior to 4,000 years ago ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). The presence of Hòabìnhian ancestry in Baojianshan suggests that the range for Hòabìnhian ancestry extended from Southeast Asia into southern China. However, its presence in a population composed of a mixture of Fujian, Guangxi, and Hòabìnhian ancestry shows that the Guangxi region on the border of Southeast Asia and southern China cannot simply be characterized by ancestry related to a single population. Mixture between these three diverse ancestries in southern China and Southeast Asia from 9,000 to 6,400 years ago shows that admixture had a marked influence on prehistoric populations prior to the introduction of farming in Guangxi and Southeast Asia.
Previous studies have suggested that the cranial morphology of prehistoric populations in Japan and Guangxi share similarities with Australo-Papuans, similar to Hòabìnhians from Southeast Asia ( Hung, 2019 25. Hung, H.-c. Prosperity and complexity without farming: the South China Coast, c. 5000–3000 BC Antiquity. 2019; 93 :325-341 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ; Hung et al., 2017 26. Hung, H.-c. ∙ Chi, Z. ∙ Matsumura, H. ... Neolithic Transition in Guangxi: A Long Development of Hunting-Gathering Society in Southern China Biol.-anthropological studies of early Holocene hunter-gatherer sites at Huiyaotian and Liyupo in Guangxi, China Tokyo National Museum of Nature and Science, 2017; 205-228 Google Scholar ; Matsumura et al., 2019 47. Matsumura, H. ∙ Hung, H.C. ∙ Higham, C. ... Craniometrics Reveal “Two Layers” of Prehistoric Human Dispersal in Eastern Eurasia Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :1451 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). A model (see Box 1 ) has been proposed whereby two layers of ancestry are present in East and Southeast Asia, a first layer represented by an early ancestry associated with prehistoric populations closely related to Australo-Papuans and a second layer that originated from northern East Asia from populations that gradually replaced the first layer with the expansion of farming ( Matsumura et al., 2019 47. Matsumura, H. ∙ Hung, H.C. ∙ Higham, C. ... Craniometrics Reveal “Two Layers” of Prehistoric Human Dispersal in Eastern Eurasia Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :1451 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, similar cranial features across specimens from southern China, Southeast Asia, and Japan that have been grouped as a first layer do not show similar groupings genetically in this study and in others ( Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al., 2019 31. Kanzawa-Kiriyama, H. ∙ Jinam, T.A. ∙ Kawai, Y. ... Late Jomon male and female genome sequences from the Funadomari site in Hokkaido, Japan Anthropol. Sci. 2019; 127 :83-108 Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar ; McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that the studied cranial features may not be capturing diversity across these pre-farming populations accurately. Lineages of deep Asian ancestry, e.g., Hòabìnhian ancestry ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ), existed, but humans sampled from the last 11,000 years across East Asia, including Guangxi, Fujian, and the Japanese archipelago, share more common ancestry with each other, revealing many offshoots of an East Asian lineage.
In historical Guangxi populations dating from ∼1,500 to 500 years ago, Shandong ancestry related to northern East Asians along the Yellow River is prominent, a pattern observed across southern China and Southeast Asia ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) . We do not observe northern ancestry in Guangxi individuals dating from 11,000 to 6,400 years ago, which suggests that movement of populations carrying Shandong ancestry occurred sometime between 6,400 and 1,500 years ago. Historical Guangxi populations, unlike Austronesians, show heavy influence from populations carrying northern East Asian ancestry, similar to present-day East Asian populations. The absence of detectable Guangxi ancestry suggests that this early East Asian lineage had vanished from southern China by this time, with no substantial contribution to the genetic diversity found in this region today. Sampling of historical Guangxi populations resolves some debate related to the recent population history of the Guangxi region ( Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum, 1991 23. Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum Survey and Research on Cliff Burials of the Left and Right River Valleys in Guangxi [in Chinese] Jianghan Archaeol. 1991; 3 :28-36 Google Scholar ; Peng, 2013b 60. Peng, S. On the Form of the Wooden Coffin Burial in Ancient Cliff Caves in Guangxi (in Chinese The 16th Annual Meeting of China Baiyue Ethnic History Research Association, China Baiyue Ethnic History Research Association, Guangdong Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, Guangzhou Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, and Department of Anthropology Sun Yat-sen University Guangzhou, Guangdong, China, 2013; 315-327 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 1986 87. Zhang, S. ∙ Peng, S. ∙ Zhou, S. Investigation report of Lihu cave burial in Nandan County, Guangxi [in Chinese] Cultural Relics. 1986; 11 :67-77 Google Scholar ; Zhou, 1991 88. Zhou, J. Discussion on the Cave Burial in Guangxi [in Chinese] Guangxi Wenwu. 1991; 2 Google Scholar ). Two major language groups are found in Guangxi today, one associated with Tai-Kadai speakers and the other with Hmong-Mien speakers. The historical Guangxi populations in our current data show that ancestry related to Tai-Kadai speakers can be found by at least ∼1,500 years ago, while ancestry related to Hmong-Mien speakers is found in individuals dating to ∼500 years ago. Thus, these two populations have lived continuously in Guangxi for at least 500 years.
By 11,000 years ago, the Guangxi region shows a deeply diverged ancestry of no relation to Hòabìnhian or Fujian ancestry that gave way to highly admixed populations by 9,000–6,400 years ago. Unlike in the Fujian region, the existence of highly admixed populations in Guangxi suggests that this region was an interaction zone among indigenous populations from Guangxi, populations from the Fujian region, and populations related to Hòabìnhians of Southeast Asia. Unlike in Southeast Asia, we find that gene flow well before farming played an important role in forming the pre-agricultural populations in these regions. These prehistoric individuals do not share a close relationship to present-day populations of Guangxi, but we have found ancestry associated with present-day Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien speakers in the historical period since 1,500 years ago. Sampling in regions near the Yangtze River and southwest China may clarify what genetic shifts occurred between 6,000 and 1,500 years ago that gave rise to the genetic composition we see today in southern China and further clarify the remarkably diverse genetic prehistory of humans across southeastern Asia.
Sampling is based on a limited number of individuals and thus may not represent the full genetic diversity present in East and Southeast Asia during this time period. Further sampling across a wider region of East and Southeast Asia over the period of 12,000 years ago to the present day will be needed to further investigate the genetic interactions of prehistoric humans in this region.

In this study, we sampled the remains of 170 ancient humans from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China ( Table S1 ). 30 individuals were successfully sequenced from 16 sites with radiocarbon dates ranging from 10,686 to 294 calibrated years before present (cal BP, Tables 1 and S1 ). In addition, we also sequenced an additional individual (Qihe3) from Qihe cave, Fujian, China, where one individual was previously sequenced ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ...

All samples but the one from Baojianshan Cave were directly dated using radiocarbon ( 14 C) dating techniques through accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), which were then calibrated using the Int Cal 20 calibration curve ( Reimer et al., 2020 70. Reimer, P.J. ∙ Austin, W.E.N. ∙ Bard, E. ... The IntCal20 Northern Hemisphere Radiocarbon Age Calibration Curve (0–55 cal kBP) Radiocarbon. 2020; 62 :725-757 Crossref Scopus (4110) Google Scholar ) ( Tables 1 and S1 ). All ages are reported as cal BP, where BP means years before present (present is AD 1950).
These samples were collected from the related archaeological institutes and research universities, with their appropriate permissions. A review board at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Science (IVPP-CAS) surveyed the samples from which we successfully retrieved aDNA for this project and approved their use for this project (review no. 202005160005).
The Longlin Laomocao Cave site is located in Longlin Autonomous County, Baise City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Human fossils – including one incomplete skull, one mandible, more than ten vertebrae, and ribs – were recovered from the cave in 1979 ( Ji et al., 2014 29. Ji, X. ∙ Wu, X. ∙ Wu, Y. ... The temporal bony labyrinthine morphology of Homo Longlin 1 from the Pleistocene–Holocene transition of South China Chin. Sci. Bull. 2014; 59 :3517 Crossref Google Scholar ). No associated artifacts were collected and no excavation was carried out thereafter. The skull morphology of Longlin_1 exhibits unusual characteristics for a modern human, with a mixture of both archaic and modern human features ( Curnoe et al., 2012 9. Curnoe, D. ∙ Xueping, J. ∙ Herries, A.I. ... Human remains from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition of southwest China suggest a complex evolutionary history for East Asians PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e31918 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 10. Curnoe, D. ∙ Ji, X. ∙ Taçon, P.S.C. ... Possible Signatures of Hominin Hybridization from the Early Holocene of Southwest China Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :12408 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). A contemporaneous early human, Maludong, found in Mengzi (Yunnan, Southwest China) shows similar characteristics as Longlin, possibly indicative of similar ancestry ( Curnoe et al., 2012 9. Curnoe, D. ∙ Xueping, J. ∙ Herries, A.I. ... Human remains from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition of southwest China suggest a complex evolutionary history for East Asians PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e31918 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such unusual cranial morphological features are not seen among Pleistocene or present-day populations of modern human ( Curnoe et al., 2012 9. Curnoe, D. ∙ Xueping, J. ∙ Herries, A.I. ... Human remains from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition of southwest China suggest a complex evolutionary history for East Asians PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e31918 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three possible hypotheses have been proposed for the presence of unusual cranial features in Longlin and Maludong: First, they represent a late-surviving archaic population ( Curnoe et al., 2012 9. Curnoe, D. ∙ Xueping, J. ∙ Herries, A.I. ... Human remains from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition of southwest China suggest a complex evolutionary history for East Asians PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e31918 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, they resulted from the retention of a large number of ancestral polymorphisms in a population of H. sapiens ( Curnoe et al., 2012 9. Curnoe, D. ∙ Xueping, J. ∙ Herries, A.I. ... Human remains from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition of southwest China suggest a complex evolutionary history for East Asians PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e31918 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, Longlin may have descended from a modern population that interbred with one or more archaic groups ( Curnoe et al., 2015 10. Curnoe, D. ∙ Ji, X. ∙ Taçon, P.S.C. ... Possible Signatures of Hominin Hybridization from the Early Holocene of Southwest China Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :12408 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We successfully obtained genome-wide data from the temporal bone of Longlin_1, who was directly radiocarbon dated to 10,686-10,439 cal BP.
The Dushan cave site is located in Linfeng Town, Tiandong County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. This cave was found in 2010 and excavated in 2011 by the Natural History Museum of Guangxi. It sits at a low isolated hill of Paleozoic limestone in a small valley 8 m above the valley floor, surrounding by typical karst peak clusters. The cave extends about 15 m in length from southwest to northeast, with an average width of 4 m. In aerial view, the interior floor is an oblique triangle, with a marked wide entrance and narrow terminal. The sediment is almost undisturbed, mainly concentrated at the entrance and becoming thinner from southwest to northeast. One archaeological test pit was excavated with an exposed area of six square meters (2 by 3 m). The test pit was excavated in intervals of 10 cm, down to the deepest horizontal layer (layer 19). Four stratigraphic units were identified (from top to bottom) based on varying characteristics of deposits. Unit І consists of thin cemented yellow silty clay containing a small number of stone artifacts and a few mammal teeth and vertebrae fragments; Unit II consists of thick gray yellow silty clay with limestone breccia, yielding flaked stone artifacts, ground stone tools, and hominin fossils; Unit III is a thick pale yellow silty clay with breccia, producing flaked stone artifacts and hominin remains, however, ground stone implements are absent in this unit; Unit IV contains cemented clay and is restricted to the northeast part of the test pit, without any cultural or animal remains ( Liao et al., 2019 36. Liao, W. ∙ Xing, S. ∙ Li, D. ... Mosaic dental morphology in a terminal Pleistocene hominin from Dushan Cave in southern China Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :2347 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). This excavation recovered more than one thousand stone artifacts and about two hundred hominin remains.
Radio carbon dating (AMS) results indicate that the age of Dushan sedimentation covers a range from the terminal Pleistocene to the early Holocene, roughly from 15,000 to 7,000 BP (7753 ± 49 cal BP to layer 17: 14995 ± 369 cal BP). Interestingly, the lithic assemblage in this site can be clearly categorized as either Neolithic or Paleolithic in good correspondence with the sedimentary strata. In Unit II (7,000-12,000 BP), the lithic assemblage includes choppers, scrapers, utilized flakes and ground stone tools including adzes and grinders. In Unit III (12,000-15,000 BP), the dominant stone tools are small flake-based tools, including well retouched scrapers and utilized flakes, and a small number of cores and choppers. All of these stone artifacts are produced from medium sized fluvial cobbles that were transported from the ancient Youjiang River, more than 10 km north of the cave.
The human samples analyzed in this paper are from the fourth horizontal layer in Unit II (40 cm beneath the surface) of Dushan Cave. In this layer, rich stone artifacts were found to accompany the human bones, mainly including stone grinders and scrapers. No evidence associated with early agriculture has been found in Dushan Cave.
We successfully obtained genome-wide data from the temporal bone of a human excavated from Layer 4 in Unit II of Dushan Cave, Dushan4_1, who was directly radiocarbon dated to 8,974-8,593 cal BP.
A separate 15,000 BP individual (Dushan1, not sampled in this study) from the same Dushan Cave, shows morphological features that are rare in modern humans but more commonly found in Middle Pleistocene archaic humans ( Liao et al., 2019 36. Liao, W. ∙ Xing, S. ∙ Li, D. ... Mosaic dental morphology in a terminal Pleistocene hominin from Dushan Cave in southern China Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :2347 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like Longlin, plausible explanations are that Dushan1 represents a late surviving individual representing some of the earliest modern humans or the ancestors of Dushan1 admixed with late-surviving archaic humans ( Liao et al., 2019 36. Liao, W. ∙ Xing, S. ∙ Li, D. ... Mosaic dental morphology in a terminal Pleistocene hominin from Dushan Cave in southern China Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :2347 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The Baojianshan Cave site (Baojianshan Cave A) is located in Longzhou County, Chongzuo City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. This cave sits at a western cliff of the Zuojiang River, 10 m above water surface and 115 m above sea level. The cave is relatively spacious, with an area of 120 m 2 . In 2013, it was excavated by the Guangxi Institute of Cultural Relic Protection and Archaeology. Two test pits (5 by 5 m and 2 by 2 m) were dug to an average depth of about 1.5 m. The strata can be divided into nine layers from top to bottom, preliminary radiocarbon dated to about 3,000 to 8,400 BP. From Layer 1 to Layer 3, the sediment mainly consists of silt clay, heavily disturbed by late human activities. Some human and animal bones, pottery fragments, implements made of stone and shell are found scattered at these layers and estimated to be from 3,000 to 4,000 years BP. Layer 4 and Layer 6 consist of shell middens, with an average thickness of 20 – 30 cm respectively, containing human and animal bones, as well as shell and stone artifacts. Layer 5 and Layer 7 to Layer 9 consist of silt clay, containing some animal bones, stone and shell artifacts, and a few pottery fragments. The thickness of these layers varies from 5 to 40 cm. Importantly, two human individual skeletons (M1 and M2) were found under Layer 5 and another one (M3) was in Layer 7.
This excavation resulted in a discovery of 1292 cultural remains in total, including 34 flaked stone artifacts and 32 ground stone tools, and more than 1100 pottery fragments. The flaked stone artifacts consist of stone anvils, cores, flakes, choppers and scrapers. The ground stone artifacts contain stone axes, stone adzes, and stone grinders. A bone sword and some implements made of shell were also unearthed during this excavation. The characteristics of the lithic assemblage of this site is similar to that of typical Neolithic sites broadly distributed along riversides in south China.
Although the Baojianshan site is close to north Vietnam and Hòabìnhian sites, the elements of the Hòabìnhian technocomplex ( Forestier, 2000 15. Forestier, H.

Results from an experimental stone artefact assemblage with relevance to the Hoabinhian of mainland Southeast Asia J. Archaeol. Sci. 2008; 35 :1189-1200 Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar ) does not occur at this site. In addition, no evidence of agriculture has been found in this site, such as domesticated animal or cultivated rice.
We sequenced two individuals from M1 and M2 of Baojianshan Cave under Layer 5. Many bones from the human skeleton from M1 were very fragmented, and most of the limb bones were broken. Based on the bone placement, the individual in M1 showed a supine with legs flexed burial. The human skeleton from M2 was identified to be a juvenile. This child was badly preserved, with most bones fragmented. The child was found in flexed burial. Both individuals were placed on and surrounded by a large number of shells.
We attempted direct radiocarbon dating from these human skeletons several times, but all attempts failed. We instead radiocarbon-dated charcoal from Layer 4, the layer above Layer 5, for which we determined a calibrated date ranging from 6,400-6,290 cal BP (2σ 95.4%). We additionally radiocarbon-dated an animal skeleton excavated from Layer 7, for which we determined a calibrated date ranging from 8,415-8,335 cal BP (2σ 95.4%). The two human specimens from Baojianshan Cave sampled in this study were both discovered under Layer 5, between Layer 7 and Layer 4. Thus, these individuals are likely older than 6,400 cal BP but younger than 8,335 cal BP. For this study, we used the date range of 8,335 - 6,400 BP for the Baojianshan individuals. We emphasize this date was retrieved indirectly, based on sampling of charcoal and animal bone from layers bracketing the layer from which human specimens were excavated.
We found that these two individuals, Baojianshan5_M1 (786,870 SNPs) and Baojianshan5_M2 (37,557 SNPs), had a familial relationship, with kinship to the second degree ( Table S1 ). For population genetic analyses, we used the higher coverage Baojianshan5_M1.
The Qihe cave is located in Zhangping, Fujian, China. Three human skulls were excavated from the same cultural phase in Qihe cave. The Qihe1 specimen is a small fragment of a child’s skull, which was not well preserved due to severe damage ( Wu et al., 2014 81. Wu, X. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Li, S. ... The early Neolithic human skull from Qihe Cave, Zhangping, Fujian Acta Anthropol Sinica. 2014; 33 :448-459 Google Scholar ), and we failed to retrieve genome-wide data . Genome-wide data for a second specimen, Qihe2 (8,428-8,359 cal BP), was retrieved in a previous study, where Qihe2′s genetic ancestry was closely related to that of Austronesians, suggesting that they either were or contributed to early ancestors of Austronesians ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we sequenced a newly excavated individual, Qihe3, who is located earlier in the strata ( Wu et al., 2014 81. Wu, X. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Li, S. ... The early Neolithic human skull from Qihe Cave, Zhangping, Fujian Acta Anthropol Sinica. 2014; 33 :448-459 Google Scholar ). The Qihe2 individual is buried with stone tools, sand tempered pottery pieces and animal bones. The Qihe3 individual was not found during the site excavation, but was discovered beneath Qihe2 during processing of the sediment block in the morphology lab at IVPP-CAS. Qihe3 was accompanied by a small amount of stone flakes and red burnt soil. Study of Qihe3′s skull morphology shows Qihe3 has a long head, large cranial capacity, high narrow face, broad and low nasal shape, consistent with other late H. sapiens ( Wu et al., 2014 81. Wu, X. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Li, S. ... The early Neolithic human skull from Qihe Cave, Zhangping, Fujian Acta Anthropol Sinica. 2014; 33 :448-459 Google Scholar ). Qihe3 was directly radiocarbon dated to 11,747-11,356 cal BP.
Cave Burial (Yandongzang) is a burial custom where the dead are placed in natural caves. This custom is distinct from both hanging coffins (wooden coffins placed on beams secured to a cliff) found in the Yangtze River region and cliff burials (excavated artificial caves on a cliff) found in Sichuan, China ( Peng, 2013a 59. Peng, S. Guangxi ancient cave burials [in Chinese] Guangxi Science & Technology Publishing House, 2013 107-114 Google Scholar ). Guangxi is the oldest region of China where cave burials have been found. They have been found from the end of the Late Neolithic up to the Ming and Qing dynasties, lasting for more than 4,000 years. Thus, Guangxi is believed to be an important birthplace of the cave burial. Cave burials are densely distributed in Guangxi, as this region is filled with developed karst features containing many natural caves. Most of the cave burial sites were chosen at the foot of mountains and mountainsides, while some were chosen on cliffs and near the top of mountains, in natural caves or rock buildings that were hidden and not accessible to people; some of the cave entrances were artificially blocked. Clan burials, in which many people are buried together, is dominant. Both primary and secondary burials are observed ( Peng, 2013a 59. Peng, S. Guangxi ancient cave burials [in Chinese] Guangxi Science & Technology Publishing House, 2013 107-114 Google Scholar ).
Based on the inscription and coffin typology, cave burials in Guangxi were believed to belong to ancestors of the Zhuang (Tai-Kadai speakers) ( Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum, 1991 23. Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum Survey and Research on Cliff Burials of the Left and Right River Valleys in Guangxi [in Chinese] Jianghan Archaeol. 1991; 3 :28-36 Google Scholar ). However, cave burials from later periods in Lihu Yaozu Town, Nandan County, Hechi City, Guangxi have been hypothesized to be connected to Miao-Yao populations (Hmong-Mien speakers) ( Zhou, 1991 88. Zhou, J. Discussion on the Cave Burial in Guangxi [in Chinese] Guangxi Wenwu. 1991; 2 Google Scholar ). It is argued that the Zhuang-Dong (Tai-Kadai speakers) in Guangxi are the original populations in the Lingnan region (Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Hong Kong, Macao), closely related to the “Baiyue” populations, various ethnicities who inhabited southern China during the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD ( Meacham, 1996 49. Meacham, W. Defining the Hundred Yue Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association Bulletin. 1996; 15 :93 Crossref Google Scholar ; Xu and Wei, 2008 82. Xu, J. ∙ Wei, X. Review on Studies of Origins of ethnic groups in the Lingnan (in Chinese with English abstract) Guangxi Ethnic Studies. 2008; 93 :115-124 Google Scholar ). Although the origin and migration of the Miao-Yao speakers (Hmong-Mien speakers) is not completely settled ( Shi, 1995 74. Shi, C. Five Migration Waves in the History of the Miao Guizhou Ethnic Studies. 1995; 01 :120-128 Google Scholar ; Xu and Wei, 2008 82. Xu, J. ∙ Wei, X. Review on Studies of Origins of ethnic groups in the Lingnan (in Chinese with English abstract) Guangxi Ethnic Studies. 2008; 93 :115-124 Google Scholar ), most scholars believe that the Miao-Yao group living in Guangxi today moved into this region in a later period spanning from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD) to the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912 AD), before later migrating from Yunnan and Guangxi to Vietnam, Laos and Thailand ( Zhang et al., 1986 87. Zhang, S. ∙ Peng, S. ∙ Zhou, S. Investigation report of Lihu cave burial in Nandan County, Guangxi [in Chinese] Cultural Relics. 1986; 11 :67-77 Google Scholar ).
We sequenced 26 individuals from 12 cave burials with coffins in Guangxi. Individuals from nine sites date to 1,688-1,278 cal BP, but three sites (Gaofeng, Huaqiao, Huatuyan) date to 513-294 years ago and are located in Lihu Yaozu Town, Nandan County, Guangxi, where the Baikuyao, a subbranch of the Yao population, primarily live today. Thus, our historical individuals range from 1,688-294 years ago.
The Banda cave site is located in Dahua Yao Autonomous County, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Banda shows characteristics of the late period of Cave Burials in Guangxi. The coffins in Banda have heads and tails in the style of horns ( Peng, 2013b 60. Peng, S. On the Form of the Wooden Coffin Burial in Ancient Cliff Caves in Guangxi (in Chinese The 16th Annual Meeting of China Baiyue Ethnic History Research Association, China Baiyue Ethnic History Research Association, Guangdong Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, Guangzhou Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, and Department of Anthropology Sun Yat-sen University Guangzhou, Guangdong, China, 2013; 315-327 Google Scholar ). The human skulls found in this cave show the custom of tooth ablation ( Peng, 2009 58. Peng, S. Archaeological Discovery of Tooth Extraction Custom of Ancient Residents in Lingnan [in Chinese] Cultural Relics of Southern China, 2009 80-88 Google Scholar ). We successfully sequenced two individuals from Banda cave, BandaKD11 and BandaKD15. BandaKD15 was directly radiocarbon dated to 1,517-1,353 cal BP, and BandaKD11 was directly radiocarbon dated to 1,467-1,307 cal BP.
The Layi (Laba) cave site is located on the bank of Hongshui River, Baida Village, Beijing Town, Dahua Yao Autonomous County, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. There are four caves associated with this site, where Caves 1 and 2 are on the left bank of the river while Caves 3 and 4 are on the right. Human bones, pottery fragments, stone tools, bone tools and coffins were collected from the caves ( Peng, 2001 57. Peng, C. Preliminary study on early cave burials in Guangxi [in Chinese] Guangxi Ethnic Studies, 2001 84-90 Google Scholar ). The coffins were made of intact wood with the head and tail decorated in the shape of horns and swallowtails ( Peng, 2013a 59. Peng, S. Guangxi ancient cave burials [in Chinese] Guangxi Science & Technology Publishing House, 2013 107-114 Google Scholar ). The human skulls found in this cave show the custom of tooth ablation ( Peng, 2009 58. Peng, S. Archaeological Discovery of Tooth Extraction Custom of Ancient Residents in Lingnan [in Chinese] Cultural Relics of Southern China, 2009 80-88 Google Scholar ). We sequenced LayiKD01 from KD01, Cave 1. We directly radiocarbon dated LayiKD01 to 1,532-1,403 cal BP.
The Qinchang cave site, near the Hongshui River, is located on Nongshi Hillside, Qinchang, Yantan Town, Dahua Yao Autonomous County, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Coffins with torch-shaped heads were found in Qinchang Cave ( Peng, 2013b 60. Peng, S. On the Form of the Wooden Coffin Burial in Ancient Cliff Caves in Guangxi (in Chinese The 16th Annual Meeting of China Baiyue Ethnic History Research Association, China Baiyue Ethnic History Research Association, Guangdong Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, Guangzhou Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, and Department of Anthropology Sun Yat-sen University Guangzhou, Guangdong, China, 2013; 315-327 Google Scholar ). The human skulls found in this cave have the custom of tooth ablation ( Peng, 2009 58. Peng, S. Archaeological Discovery of Tooth Extraction Custom of Ancient Residents in Lingnan [in Chinese] Cultural Relics of Southern China, 2009 80-88 Google Scholar ). We sequenced genome-wide data for two individuals (KD13 in Grave M1:1 and KD14 in Grave 6) at Qinchang Cave using bone samples from their teeth. QinchangKD13 was directly radiocarbon dated to 1,520-1,363 cal BP, and QinchangKD14 was directly radiocarbon dated to 1,545-1,407 cal BP.
The Balong cave site is located in Beijing Town, Dahua Yao Autonomous County, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Four complete human skulls were found in coffins that had horn-shaped tails and heads ( Peng, 2013a 59. Peng, S. Guangxi ancient cave burials [in Chinese] Guangxi Science & Technology Publishing House, 2013 107-114 Google Scholar ). We sequenced four individuals from Balong. From our kinship analysis, we found that two of the sampled individuals share kinship with another individual: BalongKD06 shows first-degree kinship with BalongKD10, and BalongKD08 shows second-degree kinship with BalongKD10 ( Table S1 ). We thus excluded BalongKD06 and BalongKD08 from population genetic analyses, keeping only the unrelated BalongKD07 and BalongKD10 for further analysis. We directly radiocarbon dated BalongKD07 to 1,688-1,414 cal BP and BalongKD10 to 1,568-1,409 cal BP.
The Lada cave site is located in Jinchengjiang District, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. The human skulls found in this cave show the custom of tooth ablation ( Peng, 2009 58. Peng, S. Archaeological Discovery of Tooth Extraction Custom of Ancient Residents in Lingnan [in Chinese] Cultural Relics of Southern China, 2009 80-88 Google Scholar ). We sequenced genome-wide data for the temporal bone of the specimen LadaKH01, whom we directly radiocarbon dated to 1,467-1,307 cal BP.
The Yiyang (Bayang) cave site is located in Pingguo County, Baise City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. There are 21 coffins in this site. One individual YiyangKP17 was sequenced, and directly radiocarbon dated to 1,467-1,307 cal BP.
The Shenxian cave site is located in Pingguo County, Baise City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. The human skulls found in this cave show the custom of tooth ablation for eight of twelve individuals ( Peng, 2009 58. Peng, S. Archaeological Discovery of Tooth Extraction Custom of Ancient Residents in Lingnan [in Chinese] Cultural Relics of Southern China, 2009 80-88 Google Scholar ). We sequenced ShenxianKP09 from the temporal bone and directly radiocarbon dated the specimen to 1,350-1,278 cal BP.
The Cenxun cave site (Cenxundong) is located on Cenxun Mountain, Taiping Town, Pingguo County, Baise City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Cave burials of this site possibly extended from the Sui and Tang Dynasties to the early Ming Dynasty based on the archaeological evidence ( Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum, 1991 23. Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum Survey and Research on Cliff Burials of the Left and Right River Valleys in Guangxi [in Chinese] Jianghan Archaeol. 1991; 3 :28-36 Google Scholar ). A secondary burial style was observed ( Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum, 1991 23. Guangxi Museum and Tiandong County Museum Survey and Research on Cliff Burials of the Left and Right River Valleys in Guangxi [in Chinese] Jianghan Archaeol. 1991; 3 :28-36 Google Scholar ), and three of six human skulls found in this cave show the custom of tooth ablation ( Peng, 2013a 59. Peng, S. Guangxi ancient cave burials [in Chinese] Guangxi Science & Technology Publishing House, 2013 107-114 Google Scholar ). Our study sequenced three individuals and directly radiocarbon dated them: CenxunKP05 (1,467-1,307 cal BP), CenxunKP07 (1,366-1,293 cal BP) and CenxunKP13 (1,511-1,310 cal BP).
The Gaofeng site is a cave located on Gaofeng Mountain, about 0.5 km east of Huatu Village, Lihu Yaozu Town, Nandan County, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. There was a well-preserved coffin with traces of remaining lime daub. The buried individual was found lying in an extended side position and was an original burial ( Zhang et al., 1986 87. Zhang, S. ∙ Peng, S. ∙ Zhou, S. Investigation report of Lihu cave burial in Nandan County, Guangxi [in Chinese] Cultural Relics. 1986; 11 :67-77 Google Scholar ). The tooth ablation custom is found at very low frequency in Lihu Yaozu Town, Nandan County, suggesting that it was not practiced in Nandan County ( Peng, 2013a 59. Peng, S. Guangxi ancient cave burials [in Chinese] Guangxi Science & Technology Publishing House, 2013 107-114 Google Scholar ). The specimen GaofengNL23 was sequenced and directly radiocarbon dated to 421 cal BP. Kinship analysis revealed that this individual share kinship to the second degree with an individual from the Huatayan cave site, HuatuyanNL04.
The Huaqiao site, which has three caves, is located on Baitai Mountain, in Huaqiao Village, Lihu Yaozu Town, Nandan County, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. There are four coffins in Cave 1, 20 coffins in Cave 2, and seven coffins in Cave 3 ( Zhang et al., 1986 87. Zhang, S. ∙ Peng, S. ∙ Zhou, S. Investigation report of Lihu cave burial in Nandan County, Guangxi [in Chinese] Cultural Relics. 1986; 11 :67-77 Google Scholar ). We obtained genome-wide data from a tooth and a temporal bone belonging to the individual HuaqiaoNL26, found in Grave 4, Cave 2. We directly radiocarbon dated this individual to 514-428 cal BP.
The Huatuyan site is a cave located on the hillside southeast of Huatu Village, Lihu Yaozu Town, Nandan County, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. There are 28 coffins with wooden frames. Each coffin contained two to four human individuals lying in a straight-limbed position ( Zhang et al., 1986 87. Zhang, S. ∙ Peng, S. ∙ Zhou, S. Investigation report of Lihu cave burial in Nandan County, Guangxi [in Chinese] Cultural Relics. 1986; 11 :67-77 Google Scholar ). We sequenced eight individuals in this study, and excluded three individuals for high kinship patterns with other sequenced individuals. HuatuyanNL04 in Grave 3 shares kinship to the second degree with HuatuyanNL17 and GaofengNL23. HuatuyanNL06 in Grave 5 shares kinship to the second degree with HuatuyanNL21 and HuatuyanNL17. HuatuyanNL18 in Grave 16 shares kinship to the second degree with HuatuyanNL21. The five individuals we used in our population genetic analyses are HuatuyanNL02 (NL02, Grave 2, 466-306 cal BP), HuatuyanNL11 (NL11, Grave 7, 477-312 cal BP), HuatuyanNL17 (NL17, Grave 15, 509-320 cal BP), HuatuyanNL19 (NL19, Grave 16, 455-294 cal BP), HuatuyanNL21 (NL21, Grave 18, 495-315 cal BP), all of whom were directly radiocarbon dated.
The Yinwang cave site (Yinwangdong) is located on Nian Mountain, in Liming Village, Liming Township, Pingguo County, Baise City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. This individual shows a second-degree kinship with HuatuyanNL02, suggesting that this individual was possibly contemporaneous to Huatuyan individuals around 500 years ago. Only 12,700 SNPs were successfully sequenced from this individual, so this kinship is also possibly due to the low number of SNPs available for analyses. We excluded Yinwang from further population genetic analysis.
The ancient DNA work was carried out in dedicated ancient DNA clean-room facilities at the Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of Chinese Academy of Sciences, IVPP-CAS. For each of 170 ancient human remains from Guangxi, China ( Table S1 ), we drilled powder either from the petrous portion of the temporal bone ( Pinhasi et al., 2015 63. Pinhasi, R. ∙ Fernandes, D. ∙ Sirak, K. ... Optimal Ancient DNA Yields from the Inner Ear Part of the Human Petrous Bone PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0129102 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pinhasi et al., 2019 64.

Protoc. 2019; 14 :1194-1205 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) or from a tooth. Using the bone or tooth powder, we extracted DNA following a previously published protocol ( Dabney et al., 2013 11. Dabney, J. ∙ Knapp, M. ∙ Glocke, I. ... Complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a Middle Pleistocene cave bear reconstructed from ultrashort DNA fragments Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :15758-15763 Crossref Scopus (924) PubMed Google Scholar ). A single-stranded protocol (“SS”) ( Dabney et al., 2013 11. Dabney, J. ∙ Knapp, M. ∙ Glocke, I. ...

A high-coverage genome sequence from an archaic Denisovan individual Science. 2012; 338 :222-226 Crossref Scopus (1280) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to prepare the libraries for all samples. We treated eight libraries with uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG) from E. coli and endonuclease (Endo VIII) (“SS UDG”) to remove deaminated cytosine residues ( Briggs et al., 2007 6. Briggs, A.W. ∙ Stenzel, U. ∙ Johnson, P.L.F. ... Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :14616-14621 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table 1 ). Library amplifications were performed using the AccuPrimepfx DNA enzyme, for 35 cycles ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To capture DNA in solution, we used oligonucleotide probes synthesized by Agilent Technologies (California, USA). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was captured using oligonucleotide probes synthesized from a complete human mitochondrial genome ( Fu et al., 2013a 16. Fu, Q. ∙ Meyer, M. ∙ Gao, X. ... DNA analysis of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave, China Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :2223-2227 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nuclear genome was enriched for approximately 1.2 million SNPs ( Fu et al., 2015 19. Fu, Q. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ∙ Moldovan, O.T. ... An early modern human from Romania with a recent Neanderthal ancestor Nature. 2015; 524 :216-219 Crossref Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The enriched mitochondrial DNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina Miseq instruments with 2 × 76 base pairs (bp) paired-end reads, and the enriched nuclear DNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq4000 instruments with 2 × 100 bp and 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads. We then utilized leeHom ( Renaud et al., 2014 71. Renaud, G. ∙ Stenzel, U. ∙ Kelso, J. leeHom: adaptor trimming and merging for Illumina sequencing reads Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :e141 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( https://github.com/grenaud/leeHom ) to trim adaptors and merge paired reads into a single sequence (overlap > 11 base pairs). Merged reads at least 30 bp in length were then mapped to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) ( Andrews et al., 1999 2. Andrews, R.M. ∙ Kubacka, I. ∙ Chinnery, P.F. ... Reanalysis and revision of the Cambridge reference sequence for human mitochondrial DNA Nat. Genet. 1999; 23 :147 Crossref Scopus (2711) PubMed Google Scholar ) (for mtDNA), and to the human reference genome hg19 (for nuclear DNA) with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA, version 0.6.1) ( Li and Durbin, 2009 34. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32769) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the samse command (-n 0.01 and -l 16500). For duplicated reads with the same orientation, we kept the highest quality sequence for analysis and removed the duplicates, along with reads with mapping quality scores less than 30.
To ensure the authenticity of ancient DNA, we calculated the C-to-T deamination proportion ( Sawyer et al., 2012 72. Sawyer, S. ∙ Krause, J. ∙ Guschanski, K. ... Temporal patterns of nucleotide misincorporations and DNA fragmentation in ancient DNA PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e34131 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table 1 ). We estimated the contamination rates based on mtDNA and X chromosome contamination rates. The mtDNA contamination rate was determined by ContamMix ( Fu et al., 2013b 17. Fu, Q. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Johnson, P.L.F. ... A revised timescale for human evolution based on ancient mitochondrial genomes Curr. Biol. 2013; 23 :553-559 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ). For males, we tested contamination for the X chromosome ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 32. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (1561) PubMed Google Scholar ). For both methods, if the contamination was > 3%, the library was treated as contaminated ( Table 1 ). For libraries with low contamination of the nuclear DNA as determined by the X chromosome, but slightly higher contamination of the mtDNA, we used all fragments for further analysis.
For those libraries with substantial contamination (> 3% nuclear DNA), we restricted our analyses to only the fragments having characteristics typical of ancient DNA damage in order to retain as many individuals as possible for analysis ( Briggs et al., 2007 6. Briggs, A.W. ∙ Stenzel, U. ∙ Johnson, P.L.F. ... Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :14616-14621 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ). Damaged fragments were retrieved by filtering out fragments with at least one C→T substitution in the first three positions at the 5′ end and the last three positions at the 3′ end by using pmdtools0.60 ( Skoglund et al., 2014 77. Skoglund, P. ∙ Northoff, B.H. ∙ Shunkov, M.V. ... Separating endogenous ancient DNA from modern day contamination in a Siberian Neandertal Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :2229-2234 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the –customterminus parameter. These libraries were referred to as damage-restricted libraries in Table 1 .
We ignored the first and last five positions of each fragment and generated pseudo-haploid genotype calls by randomly sampling one fragment per position to determine an allele for that individual ( Fu et al., 2015 19. Fu, Q. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ∙ Moldovan, O.T. ... An early modern human from Romania with a recent Neanderthal ancestor Nature. 2015; 524 :216-219 Crossref Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We used two panels of present-day datasets. For PCA, ADMIXTURE, and f 3 -statistics, we took populations from the Human Origin (HO) SNP Panel ( Patterson et al., 2012 56. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1550) PubMed Google Scholar ), Tibetan and Han populations from Lu et al. ( Lu et al., 2016 40. Lu, D. ∙ Lou, H. ∙ Yuan, K. ... Ancestral Origins and Genetic History of Tibetan Highlanders Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 99 :580-594 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ), Southeast Asian populations from Liu et al. ( Liu et al., 2020 38. Liu, D. ∙ Duong, N.T. ∙ Ton, N.D. ... Extensive Ethnolinguistic Diversity in Vietnam Reflects Multiple Sources of Genetic Diversity Mol. Biol. Evol. 2020; 37 :2503-2519 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), and populations in southern China from Wang et al. ( Wang et al., 2021 80. Wang, C.-C. ∙ Yeh, H.-Y. ∙ Popov, A.N. ... Genomic insights into the formation of human populations in East Asia Nature. 2021; 591 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). For f 4 -statistics and qpAdm analysis, we assembled the panel of 1240k capture SNPs from the Simons Genome Diversity Panel (SGDP) ( Mallick et al., 2016 41. Mallick, S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Lipson, M. ... The Simons Genome Diversity Project: 300 genomes from 142 diverse populations Nature. 2016; 538 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ), the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP)-shotgun data ( Li et al., 2008 35. Li, J.Z. ∙ Absher, D.M. ∙ Tang, H. ... Worldwide human relationships inferred from genome-wide patterns of variation Science. 2008; 319 :1100-1104 Crossref Scopus (1507) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Tibetan populations from Lu et al. ( Lu et al., 2016 40. Lu, D. ∙ Lou, H. ∙ Yuan, K. ... Ancestral Origins and Genetic History of Tibetan Highlanders Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 99 :580-594 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The degrees of kinship among newly sampled individuals were estimated using the software READ ( Monroy Kuhn et al., 2018 51. Monroy Kuhn, J.M. ∙ Jakobsson, M. ∙ Günther, T. Estimating genetic kin relationships in prehistoric populations PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0195491 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was developed specifically to handle pseudo-haploid genotypes for prehistoric populations. We kept all the unrelated individuals for subsequent analyses. For each set of individuals sharing kinship, we determined the number of SNPs that were successfully sequenced and kept the individual from that kinship set with the highest number of SNPs available for analysis. We ultimately excluded seven individuals ( Table S1 ) using this kinship criteria, leaving 23 Guangxi individuals which we used for subsequent population genetic analyses.
Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed with the smartpca program of the EIGENSOFT package ( Patterson et al., 2006 55. Patterson, N. ∙ Price, A.L. ∙ Reich, D. Population structure and eigenanalysis PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e190 Crossref Scopus (3509) PubMed Google Scholar ) using default options except lsqproject: YES, numoutlieriter: 0 and shrinkmode: YES for all present-day East Asians. All the ancient individuals sampled in this study and the previously published ancient Asians were projected onto the PCA determined for present-day East Asians ( Figure S1 C). To increase resolution, we visualized estimated principal components for southern East Asians and Southeast Asians ( Figure 1 C).
We used the software qp3Pop (version 412) and qpDstat (version 712) in AdmixTools ( Patterson et al., 2012 56. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1550) PubMed Google Scholar ) to calculate the f 3 - and f 4 -statistics, respectively. For qpDstat, we used “f4mode: YES.” If the number of individuals in a group was greater than one, we used frequency data to calculate f-statistics ( Table 1 ); otherwise, we used a 0/1 count ( Durand et al., 2011 14. Durand, E.Y. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Reich, D. ... Testing for ancient admixture between closely related populations Mol. Biol. Evol. 2011; 28 :2239-2252 Crossref Scopus (810) PubMed Google Scholar ). Outgroup f 3 -analysis ( Raghavan et al., 2014 69. Raghavan, M. ∙ Skoglund, P. ∙ Graf, K.E. ... Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans Nature. 2014; 505 :87-91 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ) had the form f 3 (Mbuti; X, Y) , and f 4 -statistics had the form f 4 (Mbuti, X; Y, Z) , where the present-day Central African Mbuti are used to represent an outgroup.
Our methodology to determine which individual samples could be grouped together used a combination of outgroup f 3 , PCA, and f 4 comparisons. We computed outgroup- f 3 statistics of the form f 3 (X, Y; Mbuti) to measure the shared genetic drift between newly sampled Guangxi individuals ( Figure S1 A). To differentiate each individual, we used the “Individual ID” in Table 1 . We found that the three prehistoric individuals could not be clustered, and the historical individuals formed three clusters, with three individuals that could not fit into any cluster.
Using these results, we re-categorized our individuals into one of nine IDs, as follows: • “Longlin”: Longlin_1 • “Dushan”: Dushan4_1 • “Baojianshan”: Baojianshan5_M1 • “LaCen”: LadaKH01, CenxunKP07, CenxunKP13 • “BaBanQinCen”: BalongKD10, BalongKD07, BandaKD11, BandaKD15, QinchangKD13, QinchangKD14, CenxunKP05 • “GaoHuaHua”: GaofengNL23, HuaqiaoNL26, HuatuyanNL02, HuatuyanNL17, HuatuyanNL11, HuatuyanNL19 • “Shenxian”: ShenxianKP09 • “Yiyang”: YiyangKP17 • “Layi”: LayiKD01
The three clusters of historical individuals were labeled BaBanQinCen, LaCen, and GaoHuaHua. The eight BaBanQinCen individuals and three LaCen individuals date to ∼1,500 years ago, while the six GaoHuaHua individuals date to ∼500 years ago. GaoHuaHua individuals dating to about 500 years ago cluster with each other and differentiate from other historical individuals who date to about 1,500 BP, showing a population shift occurred between 1,500 years ago to 500 years ago. This grouping is consistent with the results of a PCA ( Figure 1 C), where the GaoHuaHua cluster differentiates from other historical individuals. Other historical individuals are located near each other in the PCA but are slightly differentiated.
To further confirm our choice of clustering, we checked the pairwise f 4 -statistics in f 4 (Mbuti, various populations; Individual_X, Individual_X) in Table S2 . In all cases, we can separate historical individuals into two major clusters based on time (∼500-year-old and ∼1500-year-old). To avoid genetic structure across individuals influencing a cluster, we used clear separations in pairwise outgroup- f 3 statistics ( Figure S1 A) to form several subgroups within the temporal clusters. Those with low genetic similarity to each other were not grouped together, and in some cases, single individuals were kept separate in analyses.
Population relationships with deep Asians. In the PCA, Longlin is the most centrally located of the newly sampled individuals and does not cluster with any particular present-day East Asians ( Figure S1 C). In an outgroup- f 3 analysis ( Figure S1 D), we found that both Longlin and Baojianshan do not share high genetic similarity with East Asians sampled to date.
To test how deeply the lineages of prehistoric samples diverged among sampled Asian populations, we compared them to a set of “Deep Asians,” who diverged deeply in the Eastern Eurasian lineage. The “Deep Asians” set includes the 40,000-year old Asian Tianyuan ( Yang et al., 2017 83. Yang, M.A. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Theunert, C. ... 40,000-year-old individual from Asia provides insight into early population structure in Eurasia Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :3202-3208.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), the present-day Andaman islander Onge, the New Guinea indigenous Papuan, an ∼8,000 year-old Southeast Asian Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherer (La368) ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ∼3,000-year-old prehistoric individuals from Japan (Ikawazu ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Japan_Jōmon ( Wang et al., 2021 80. Wang, C.-C. ∙ Yeh, H.-Y. ∙ Popov, A.N. ... Genomic insights into the formation of human populations in East Asia Nature. 2021; 591 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar )).
We calculated two sets of f 4 -statistics, f 4 (Mbuti, aGX; X, Deep Asians) ( Table S2 ), and f 4 (Mbuti, X; aGX, Deep Asians) ( Table S2 ) where aGX are the three prehistoric Guangxi individuals Longlin, Baojianshan, and Dushan, and X includes various ancient East Asians representing different ancestries found across East Asia. Using these two statistics, we could determine whether the individuals sequenced in this study share more alleles with ancient East Asians or with one or more of the Deep Asians. We found that Longlin, Dushan, and Baojianshan all cluster with Early Neolithic northern and southern East Asians who mainly contributed to present-day East Asians ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) rather than with Papuan, Onge, Hòabìnhian, and Tianyuan who possess a deep Asian lineage. This suggests that these three Guangxi individuals are not as deeply diverged from East Asians as these four Deep Asians.
We then compared prehistoric Guangxi populations with the Jōmon from Japan. Comparing to deep Asians (Tianyuan, Papuan, Onge), Longlin and Ikawazu are genetically closer to each other, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin/Ikawazu; Ikawazu/Longlin, Tianyuan/Papuan/Onge) < 0 (−7.3 < Z < −3.4, Table S2 ). Relative to the Jōmon, Dushan significantly clusters with Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians, but both Longlin and Baojianshan show equal amounts of genetic similarity with these East Asians as with the Jōmon. Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians are also similarly related to Longlin and Ikawazu, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, EN_SD/EN_FJ; Longlin, Ikawazu)∼0 (0.5 < Z < 2.2, Table S2 ). Both the Jōmon and Longlin have connections to the Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians not found in the other population, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; Ikawazu, EN_SD/EN_FJ) > 0 and f 4 (Mbuti, Ikawazu; Longlin, EN_SD/EN_FJ) > 0 . We also observed a similar pattern for Baojianshan as found for Longlin, indicating that they are as deeply diverged from Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians as the Jōmon, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Baojianshan; Ikawazu, EN_SD/EN_FJ) > 0 (4.8 < Z < 7.3, Table S2 ), f 4 (Mbuti, Ikawazu; Baojianshan, EN_SD/EN_FJ) > 0 (4.3 < Z < 6.3, Table S2 ), and f 4 (Mbuti, EN_SD/EN_FJ; Baojianshan, Ikawazu)∼0 (−1.3 < Z < 0.5, Table S2 ). Thus, the separation of Longlin-related and Baojianshan-related ancestries from Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians occurred more recently than that of Tianyuan-, Onge-, Papuan-, and Hòabìnhian-related ancestries. Longlin, Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians, and the Jōmon, however, are similarly related.
To explore whether there is any shared affinity with Deep Asians contributing to the genetic distance between Longlin and Baojianshan from Neolithic East Asians, we computed f 4 (Mbuti, Deep Asian; Longlin/Baojianshan, Early Neolithic East Asian) , where Early Neolithic East Asian includes some Northern-related ancestries from Siberia, Far East and Mongolia (E_N_northern-related: Shamanka_EN ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018b 13. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ...

Interestingly, Longlin shows no affinity with any of the Deep Asians, as f 4 (Mbuti, Tianyuan/Papuan/Onge/Hòabìnhian; Longlin, Early Neolithic East Asian)∼0 (−2.7 < Z < 0.3, Table S2 ). However, Baojianshan shows significant Hòabìnhian-related affinity in f 4 (Mbuti, Hòabìnhian; Baojianshan, E_N_northern-related East Asians) < 0 (−4.1 < Z < −3.2, Table S2 ). We further calculated this statistic using transversions only, and we find that this pattern remains significant (−4.8 < Z < −2.5, Table S2 ). This connection is consistent with results from qpAdm, qpGraph and Treemix in the later method sections, giving robust support to a genetic connection between Baojianshan and Hòabìnhian.
Several major Asian lineages have been described to date – one related to the geographically northern East Eurasian 40,000-year-old Tianyuan ( Fu et al., 2013a 16. Fu, Q. ∙ Meyer, M. ∙ Gao, X. ... DNA analysis of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave, China Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :2223-2227 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2017 83.

Biol. 2017; 27 :3202-3208.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ) in northern East Eurasia, one related to the Onge and Hòabìnhians ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) in southern East Eurasia, and one that gave rise to the Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian populations that have broadly contributed to present-day East Asians ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). The deep divergence of Tianyuan- and Hòabìnhian-related lineages from East Asian ancestry found today in mainland East and Southeast Asia shows that many diverse human groups were found in Asia. Here, we tested the relationship between Longlin and the geographically southern and northern East Eurasian deep lineages represented by Onge/Hòabìnhians and Tianyuan. We do not observe excess similarity of Longlin to either Onge or Tianyuan, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; Onge, Tianyuan)∼0 (Z = 0.3, Table S2 ). When we modeled the phylogenetic relationship between these populations, we found that Longlin has no Onge-related affiliation, and instead Longlin represents another deep lineage in southern East Eurasia ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Substituting the present-day Onge with the ancient Hòabìnhian La368, we saw connections between Longlin and Hòabìnhians, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; La368, Tianyuan)∼0 (Z = −2.7), f 4 (Mbuti, La368; Longlin, Tianyuan) < 0 (Z = −3.7), and f 4 (Mbuti, Tianyuan; Longlin, La368)∼0 (Z = −0.9). This pattern is not found using transversions only, i.e., f 4 ( Mbuti, Longlin; La368, Tianyuan)∼0 . (Z = −0.3), f 4 (Mbuti, La368; Longlin, Tianyuan)∼0 (Z = −1.4), and f 4 (Mbuti, Tianyuan; Longlin, La368)∼0 (Z = −1.1). Thus, the relationship between Tianyuan, Hòabìnhians, and Longlin is still unclear. However, combining the statistics above and different phylogenetic tools ( Figures 2 A and 2B), we find that Hòabìnhians and Longlin definitively do not share the same ancestry. Thus, hunter-gatherers in southeastern Asia dating to the last 11,000 years are composed of at least two lineages – one related to Longlin and another related to the Onge and Hòabìnhians ( Figure 2 B).
Population relationships with Early East Eurasians. We next tested how these three prehistoric Guangxi populations compared to a set of “Early East Eurasians,” namely Neolithic and Bronze Age populations of East Eurasia ( Table S2 ), including those carrying northern East Asian-related (northern East Asians from Shandong ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), denoted as EN_SD ), southern East Asian-related (southern East Asians from Fujian ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), denoted as EN_FJ ), Tibetan-related (e.g., Chokhopani ( Jeong et al., 2016 28. Jeong, C. ∙ Ozga, A.T. ∙ Witonsky, D.B. ... Long-term genetic stability and a high-altitude East Asian origin for the peoples of the high valleys of the Himalayan arc Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :7485-7490 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar )), and Siberian-related ancestry (e.g., Kolyma ( Sikora et al., 2019 76. Sikora, M. ∙ Pitulko, V.V. ∙ Sousa, V.C. ... The population history of northeastern Siberia since the Pleistocene Nature. 2019; 570 :182-188 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ), Shamanka_EN ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018b 13. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ... The first horse herders and the impact of early Bronze Age steppe expansions into Asia Science. 2018; 360 :eaar7711 Crossref Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar )). Due to the close relationship Native American ancestry shares with East Asian ancestry, we also compared against present-day populations and ancient individuals carrying Native American ancestry ( Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018 52. Moreno-Mayar, J.V. ∙ Potter, B.A. ∙ Vinner, L. ... Terminal Pleistocene Alaskan genome reveals first founding population of Native Americans Nature. 2018; 553 :203-207 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genetic relationships between Guangxi populations and this larger panel of Early East Eurasians are all performed with f 4 -statistics and presented as tables. To have a better understanding of the genetic affiliation with East Asians, we focused on Early Neolithic northern East Asians from Shandong and southern East Asians from Fujian and surrounding regions.
Using f 4 -statistics comparing prehistoric Guangxi individuals to the above East Eurasians and Native Americans, we find that both Longlin and Baojianshan behave as an outgroup relative to Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians. That is, f 4 (Mbuti, EN_FJ/EN_SD; Longlin/Baojianshan, EN_SD/EN_FJ) > 0 (2.3 < Z < 19, Table S2 ). For Dushan, the f 4 -analysis does not clearly place Dushan as an outgroup to northern and southern East Asians as found for Longlin and Baojianshan (−1.5 < Z < 3.5, Table S2 ), though we observe that in an outgroup f 3 -analysis, Longlin shares the highest genetic similarity with Dushan ( Figure S1 B). We further observe that Dushan shows significant affinity to Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians but not with Native Americans, Siberians, and Plateau populations, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan; EN_SD/EN_FJ, Native American/ancient Siberian/Plateau) < 0 (−11.1 < Z < −3.2, Table S2 ). These results highlight that Dushan shares more alleles with Early Neolithic Shandong and Fujian East Asians than what is observed for Longlin and Baojianshan, though Dushan does show some patterns similar to an outgroup.
In an outgroup f 3 -analysis, we observe that Dushan shares higher genetic drift with southern East Asians ( Figure S1 D). To assess whether Dushan shares a connection with Early Neolithic Fujian populations specifically, we tested f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan; EN_FJ, EN_SD)∼0 (−3.1 < Z < −0.2), which shows that Dushan shows a slight affinity to these southern East Asians relative to Early Neolithic Shandong populations, but similarly related to both in most configurations. We also observe that f 4 (Mbuti, EN_FJ; Dushan, EN_SD)∼0 (−1.5 < Z < 1.5) and f 4 (Mbuti, EN_SD; Dushan, EN_FJ)∼0 (0.3 < Z < 3.5, Table S2 ), which suggests that there is no clear affinity to southern East Asians relative to northern East Asians.
The newly sequenced individual from Fujian, Qihe3, clusters generally with southern East Asians ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, Qihe3 clusters closely with the other Qihe ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) individual relative to northern East Asians, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Qihe3; Qihe, EN_SD) < 0 (−6.2 < Z < −5.1, Table S2 ), and f 4 (Mbuti, Qihe; Qihe3, EN_SD) < 0 (−6.1 < Z < −3.7, Table S2 ). But interestingly, Qihe3 shows a less close relationship to the other Qihe individual relative to the other southern East Asians, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Qihe3; Qihe, Liangdao1/Liangdao2)∼0 (−2.2 < Z < −2.1, Table S2 ), and f 4 (Mbuti, Qihe; Qihe3, Liangdao1/Liangdao2) < 0 (−2.1 < Z < −2.0, Table S2 ).
Population relationships with southern East and Southeast Asians since the Late Neolithic. Prehistoric Guangxi populations, especially Dushan, share the most genetic drift with southern East Asians, Southeast Asians, and the historical Guangxi populations ( Figure 1 C). Geographically, we see shared ancestry in both southern Chinese provinces of Fujian and Guangxi during the Neolithic. To determine if younger southern East Asians and Southeast Asians share more ancestry with Neolithic Guangxi or Fujian southern East Asians, we compared f 4 (Mbuti, younger populations; Bianbian, Qihe3) to f 4 (Mbuti, younger populations; Bianbian, Dushan) , where Qihe3 is from Fujian (∼12 kBP), Dushan is from Guangxi, and Bianbian is an ancient northern East Asian (∼9.5k BP), younger populations are southern East Asians and Southeast Asians dated since Late Neolithic and historical Guangxi individuals ( Figure S2 A). Among more recent populations, we find that coastal southern East Asians, Oceania Vanuatu, and island Austronesian populations from Southeast Asia (Group 6 ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar )) are closer to Qihe3 than to Dushan. In contrast, ancient mainland Southeast Asians and historical Guangxi populations are closer to Dushan. Using f 4 (Mbuti, prehistoric GX; X, Qihe3) , we confirmed directly that prehistoric Guangxi populations are closer to younger southern East Asians and Southeast Asians than Qihe3 ( Figures S2 B and S2C).
When comparing Late Neolithic populations to prehistoric Guangxi individuals, the Late Neolithic Southeast Asian farmer population Man_Bac (4,100-year-old individuals from Vietnam) shows the highest affinity with Dushan ( Figure S2 A). The strong affiliation between Man_Bac and Dushan is further supported in that they share significantly more alleles with each other than to Qihe3, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Man_Bac/Dushan; Dushan/Man_Bac, Qihe3) < 0 (Z = −3.9 and −3.1, Figures S2 B and S2C). Furthermore, both Dushan and Baojianshan show significantly more alleles with Man_Bac than with Qihe3, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan/Baojianshan; Man_Bac, Qihe3) < 0 (Z < −3.1, Figure S2 B). However, while there is a similar pattern using transversions only, the comparison is no longer significant ( Figure S2 C). Despite the lack of concrete results from the f 4 -analysis, we find other supporting evidence of a genetic affinity between Dushan and Man_Bac, through clustering in an outgroup- f 3 analysis ( Figure S1 D), and shared ancestry in qpAdm and qpGraph analyses.
In a previous study, Man_Bac was shown to possess a mixture of ancestry belonging to deeply diverged East Eurasians and East Asians ( Lipson et al., 2018 37. Lipson, M. ∙ Cheronet, O. ∙ Mallick, S. ... Ancient genomes document multiple waves of migration in Southeast Asian prehistory Science. 2018; 361 :92-95 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). In another study, Southeast Asian hunter-gatherer Hòabìnhian-related ancestry ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) was shown to be a deeply diverged East Eurasian lineage, which suggested that Man_Bac’s deep ancestry was likely related to Hòabìnhian ancestry. Our results suggest that the deep lineage associated with Man_Bac is not related to Hòabìnhians, but rather to the deep Longlin-lineage found in Dushan in qpAdm and qpGraph section. We assessed affinity to Hòabìnhians relative to Early Neolithic East Asians, which includes Early Neolithic ancestries dating to before 7,000 years ago. These Early Neolithic populations include those with far northern-related ancestries (E_N northern-related ancestries: Shamanka_EN ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018b 13. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ...

Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar )), northern-related ancestry from Shandong ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) (EN_SD), and southern-related ancestry from Fujian ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar )(EN_FJ). We find that Man_Bac does not share excess ancestry with Hòabìnhians, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Hòabìnhian; Man_Bac, Early Neolithic East Asian)∼0 (−1.6 < Z < 0.7, Table S2 ). Using qpAdm, we found that Man_Bac can be modeled as mixture of 65.8% Dushan-related ancestry and 34.2% of Longlin-related ancestry.
We also observe that populations contemporaneous with Man_Bac dating to 4,600-4,200 BP from Fujian (Xitoucun and Tanshishan) also show a significant affinity to Dushan and Baojianshan relative to Early Neolithic southern East Asians, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan/Baojianshan; Xitoucun/Tanshishan, Qihe3) < 0 (Z < −3, Figure S2 B). In a qpGraph analysis, Xitoucun could be modeled as a mixture of ancestry related to Longlin and Qihe ( Figure S4 E). We then used qpAdm to estimate the ancestry proportions in Xitoucun and Tanshishan, and we found that both are best modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related (34.8%–54.1%), Qihe3-related (8.2%–17%) and northern East Asian-related (34.4%–44.2%) ancestries, as well as a small amount of deep ancestry represented by IndusPeriphery populations ( Narasimhan et al., 2019 53. Narasimhan, V.M. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ... The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia Science. 2019; 365 :eaat7487 Crossref Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ) (3.4%–3.9%, Table S2 ). In populations younger than 4,000 BP, the 2,000-year-old Nui_Nap in northern Vietnam and the 1,500-year-old BaBanQinCen in Guangxi (−4.2 < Z < −3.1, Figure S2 B) show similar patterns indicating affinity to Dushan and Baojianshan. Nui_Nap and BaBanQinCen cluster together in the PCA ( Figure 1 C) and f 3 -statistics ( Figure S1 D), together with other historical populations dated to around 1,500 years ago in Guangxi. Using qpAdm, both populations can be modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related (∼65%) and northern East Asian-related (∼35%) ancestry.
None of the 4,000-year-old and younger southern East Asian and Southeast Asian populations described above show a significant connection to Hòabìnhians, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Hòabìnhian; Man_Bac/Xitoucun/Tanshishan/Nui_Nap/BaBanQinCen, Early Neolithic East Asian)∼0 (−2.7 < Z < 2.1, Table S2 ), but they tend to share a connection with Dushan, who possesses deep ancestry related to Longlin. Longlin shows patterns consistent with some affinity to these southern East Asian and Southeast Asian populations ( Figure S2 B), although the patterns are not significant. Using transversions only, however, the connection between Dushan/Baojianshan and Xitoucun is the only connection that remains significant, though we still observe a consistent pattern for other populations ( Figure S2 C). Meanwhile, some younger Southeast Asians do possess deep ancestry related to Hòabìnhians, like Vt_G2, G3, and Vt778_G4_1, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, Hòabìnhian; Vt_G2/G3/Vt778_G4_1, E_N_northern-related East Asians) < 0 (−5.4 < Z < −2.4, Table S2 ). This suggests that deep ancestry in younger Southeast Asians is diverse and complex, associated with either Longlin- or Hòabìnhian-related ancestry.
We further tested the connections between the younger southern East Asian and Southeast Asian populations and Dushan in f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan; X, Qihe3). To correct for multiple comparisons and minimize the probability of type I errors, we carried out the Benjamini-Hochberg correction ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 5. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Hochberg, Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57 :289-300 Crossref Google Scholar ), using the function p.adjust in R. After the correction, we then used a p value of 0.001 (correspond to Z-score of −3.09) as the significance threshold. We then converted adjusted p values to Z-scores as a direct comparison ( Table S2 ). After correction, Xitoucun (Z = −3.8), Tanshishan (Z = −3.3), TaiwanHanben (Z = −3.4), and BaBanQinCen (Z = −3.6) still shared significantly more alleles with Dushan.
To test whether the Guangxi ancestry shared an affinity with Late Neolithic Fujian populations, we performed similar analyses as above, but grouped Qihe, Qihe3, Liangdao1, and Liangdao2 as EN_FJ, and Tanshishan, Xitoucun as LN_FJ. We found a closer genetic affinity between Dushan and LN_FJ relative to EN_FJ in f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan; LN_FJ, EN_FJ) < 0 , Z = −5.1. The result is still significant for transversions only (Z = −3.2). We found that in this case, f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; LN_FJ, DevilsCave_N/Boisman_MN) < 0 , Z = −3.1/-3.3 and f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; EN_FJ, DevilsCave_N/Boisman_MN)∼0 , Z = −0.9/-0.7. This shows that populations carrying Guangxi-related ancestry share connections to Late Neolithic Fujian populations that are not shared with Early Neolithic Fujian populations. However, we did not observe a significantly negative result for the direct f 4 -analysis, f 4 (Mbuti, Longlin; LN_FJ, EN_FJ) < 0 (Z = −2.3). One possibility is that Longlin might have some admixture with EN_FJ that offsets any Longlin-LN_FJ connection. Another explanation is f 4 (Mbuti, Dushan; LN_FJ, EN_FJ) < 0 (Z = −5.1) may be due to ancestry unrelated to Longlin, i.e., a third ancestry in Dushan that could not be observed directly with the analyses currently available.
Relationship with present-day populations. We projected ancient Guangxi populations onto the East Asian PCA, where we observe that the three prehistoric populations from Guangxi cluster near Austro-Asiatic speakers ( Figure 1 C). A similar connection was observed in a previous study ( Zhang et al., 2017 86. Zhang, X. ∙ Pei, S. ∙ Wu, X. Qingshuiyuan Dadong: A newly discovered Late Paleolithic site in Guizhou province, China Archaeol. Res. Asia. 2017; 9 :13-21 Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar ), where the mitochondrial (mtDNA) haplogroup of Longlin and another 11,201-11,079-year-old early human from Qingshuiyuan Dadong (Guizhou, China) were named as a new subhaplogroup, M71d ( Bai et al., 2020 3.

Longlin was located at the basal position on the lineage leading to M71d, sharing a maternal genetic connection with present-day populations from mainland Southeast Asia ( Bai et al., 2020 3. Bai, F. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Ji, X. ... Paleolithic genetic link between Southern China and Mainland Southeast Asia revealed by ancient mitochondrial genomes J. Hum. Genet. 2020; 65 :1125-1128 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To have a better understanding of the affinities shown in present-day populations, we compared f 4 (Mbuti, X; Bianbian, Qihe3) to f 4 (Mbuti, X; Bianbian, Dushan) . We found that present-day Austronesians are closer to Qihe3, while present-day Austro-Asiatic groups share more alleles with Dushan. Present-day populations belonging to other language groups have a moderate allele-sharing rate between Qihe3 and Dushan ( Figure S2 D). However, unlike ancient populations in Fujian, which show a close relationship to present-day Austronesians in f 4 -statistics analyses suggesting shared ancestry ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), prehistoric populations in Guangxi do not share a significant affiliation with any language speakers, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, prehistoric GX; present-day populations, Qihe3)∼0 (−2.6 < Z < 1.7, Figure S2 E).
Above, we observed the connection between Dushan and the historical Guangxi populations ( Figure S2 A). Among historical populations, BaBanQinCen shows the strongest affiliation with both Dushan and Baojianshan (Z < −3), and others also show a closer relationship to Dushan than to Qihe3 ( Figure S2 B). Meanwhile, they also show high genetic similarity with southern and northern East Asians in outgroup- f 3 statistics ( Figure S1 D). Historical Guangxi populations fall within the genetic variation observed in southern East Asians and Southeast Asians. Looking more closely, they cluster with each other, and share high genetic drift with the southern East Asian Xitoucun, Tanshishan, and the Southeast Asian Nui_Nap ( Figure S1 D). In fact, all historical Guangxi individuals share more alleles with northern East Asians than prehistoric Guangxi individuals ( Figure S1 D).
Relationship between historical Guangxi samples and present-day populations. Among historical populations, we see individuals dating to 1,500 years ago cluster with each other and overlap with Tai-Kadai groups ( Figure 1 C). In contrast, the 500-year-old GaoHuaHua individuals cluster separately from the 1,500-year-old cluster but cluster closely with Hmong-Mien speakers in the PCA ( Figure 1 C). To further define the genetic relationships between historical Guangxi populations and present-day populations, we performed the outgroup- f 3 statistics using a panel of present-day populations representing many different language groups. The results show consistently that the ∼500-year-old Guangxi populations cluster with the Hmong-Mien speakers ( Figure S3 A).
We pruned the HO dataset to account for linkage disequilibrium using ADMIXTURE ( Alexander et al., 2009 1. Alexander, D.H. ∙ Novembre, J. ∙ Lange, K. Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1655-1664 Crossref Scopus (5468) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PLINK ( Purcell et al., 2007 68. Purcell, S. ∙ Neale, B. ∙ Todd-Brown, K. ... PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81 :559-575 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23070) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v1.90b3.40) with parameters “–indep-pairwise 200 25 0.4.” A model-based maximum likelihood (ML) clustering algorithm was implemented to estimate individual ancestries and determine population structure with cross-validation. We re-ran the software 100 times using different seeds for each value of K, and we presented K = 4 to K = 7 results in Figures S3 B and S3C; the lowest CV is when K = 4.
We observed that Austronesians all share a component (pink), which is also observed at high proportions in ancient southern East Asians and Vanuatu. Northern East Asians share a component (yellow), which is found in ancient northern East Asians and widely found in present-day East Asians. The deep lineages, such as G1 (Hòabìnhian), the Indus Valley ancestry Harappan, and Juang (an Austroasiatic-speaking group from India), all share a component (orange) – however, a close relationship is not observed between these populations ( Shinde et al., 2019 75. Shinde, V. ∙ Narasimhan, V.M. ∙ Rohland, N. ... An Ancient Harappan Genome Lacks Ancestry from Steppe Pastoralists or Iranian Farmers Cell. 2019; 179 :729-735.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus do not have high confidence that the orange component reflects shared ancestry. The Southeast Asian Mlabri have a separate component (blue), that can be found in some ancient and present-day Southeast Asians.
For K = 4, we found that Longlin primarily contained deep ancestry (orange), similar to other deep ancestries, e.g., Hòabìnhian, Ikawazu. Longlin and Ikawazu harbor both northern (yellow) and southern (pink) East Asian-related ancestry components, which is consistent with their genetic relationship with East Asians mentioned above. Dushan and Baojianshan show deep ancestry (orange) mixed with Austronesian-related southern East Asian (pink) ancestry. The historical Guangxi populations show a similar genetic structure, i.e., primarily a southern East Asian (pink) ancestry with some deep ancestry (orange) and a small amount of northern East Asian ancestry (yellow). The more recent GaoHuaHua shows more northern East Asian components than other historical Guangxi populations ( Figure S3 C).
We applied qpWave ( Meyer et al., 2012 50. Meyer, M. ∙ Kircher, M. ∙ Gansauge, M.T. ... A high-coverage genome sequence from an archaic Denisovan individual Science. 2012; 338 :222-226 Crossref Scopus (1280) PubMed Google Scholar ) and qpAdm ( Haak et al., 2015 24. Haak, W. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe Nature. 2015; 522 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ) to infer ancestral sources and estimate admixture proportions for admixed populations. In all analyses, we used all SNPs (allsnps: YES). The strategy we adopted is as follows: (1) We considered all new samples and previously published ancient and present-day Southeast and southern East Asians as potential target populations by running one-way, two-way, three-way, four-way models to fit their ancestry. (2) We began with an outgroup set of distantly related populations to these potential targets, denoted “Fixed rightgroups.” (3) We assigned potential source populations, with some as a fixed source (“Fixed leftgroups”), and some that rotated through as a possible source (“Rotating populations”). We used these to run combinations of one-, two-, three-, and four-way models. When populations were treated as a target population, we did not include this population in the potential set of sources (“Fixed leftgroups”) for those analyses. (4) For the “Rotating populations,” if a population could not fit as a potential source or target population, we systematically added that population to the outgroup set. Individuals from the “Fixed leftgroups” set were never included into the outgroup set.
Rotating potential sources into the outgroups (“Fixed rightgroups”) increases the ability to identify optimal admixture models, and avoid the effects of more recent gene flow. “Rotating populations” are those that share different degrees of relationship with the “Fixed rightgroups.” Individuals in “Fixed Leftgroups” are either: (1) those that are genetically related to another population in the “Rotating populations” but more recently dated (e.g., Boshan, who belongs to “Fixed Leftgroup” is genetically close to Bianbian, a “Rotating population,” and Liangdao2, who belongs to “Fixed Leftgroup,” is genetically close to Qihe3, also a “Rotating population”) or (2) populations that have a deep lineage but date from a fairly recent period (e.g., Jōmon).

Applying the strategy described above, we start with one-way modeling and then proceed to higher ranks, up to four-way modeling. Using ‘n’ to refer to number of source populations, we considered p > 0.05 to indicate that the n-source model is possible. A second p value (p-nest) was determined by comparing the n-source model with the n-1-source model with the highest p value. A p-nest < 0.05 indicates that the higher ranking n-source model is significantly better than the n-1-source model, so the best fitting model is one that includes n-sources ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Below, we highlight the highest-ranking n-source model where p > 0.05 and pnest < 0.05, and we do not report models that do not show this fit to the data.
Qihe3. In a previous study ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), Liangdao1 was shown to have more northern East Asian ancestry than Liangdao2 and Qihe. To better understand differences among Early Neolithic Fujian populations, we considered Qihe3, Qihe (Qihe2) ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Liangdao2 ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) each as a potential target population. We also allowed Liangdao2 and Qihe3 to be a source population when not used as a target population. We did not use Qihe as a potential source population as Qihe possesses a lower number of SNPs (328,913) than Qihe3 (616,335).
In one-way modeling, Liangdao2 and Qihe3 can be modeled as the source for each other, and Qihe can be modeled with Qihe3 as the source ( Table S3 ). We then tested 2-way modeling, and we found that Liangdao2 is best modeled as a mixture of northern East Asian ancestry (e.g., Bianbian, Boshan, DevilsCave_N, 10%–18%) and Qihe3-related ancestry (82%–90%, p > 0.05, pnest < 0.05, Table S3 ), indicating Liangdao2 has more northern East Asian influence than Qihe3. Qihe3 can be modeled as a mixture of ancestry related to East Asians (e.g., Boshan, Liangdao2) and a population of deeper ancestry (e.g., Longlin, IndusPeriphery), possibly indicating that Qihe3 contains a deep lineage that Liangdao2 does not share or is diluted below the sensitivity of these tests. The 2-way models for Qihe are not a better fit than the 1-way model in Table S3 .
Longlin. The oldest prehistoric Guangxi individual Longlin shares little genetic similarity with ancient and present-day East Asians in outgroup- f 3 statistics and f 4 -statistics. Also, there is no evidence to support that any deeply diverged Asian ancestry previously sampled shares affinity with Longlin relative to other East Asians. Because we found no supporting evidence of admixture in Longlin through other analyses, we did not test Longlin as a potential target.
Dushan. In outgroup- f 3 statistics and f 4 -statistics we found Dushan has connections to Longlin, but shares more alleles with southern East Asians. To estimate admixture proportions for Dushan, we treated Dushan as a potential target. We find that Dushan cannot be modeled using a single source. In a two-way model, Dushan can be modeled as a mixture of ancestry related to Longlin and Liangdao2 (p = 0.47, Table S3 ), consistent with previous analyses showing an affiliation with Longlin and southern East Asians.
Baojianshan. Baojianshan can be modeled in a one-way model with ancestry related to Longlin (p = 0.41, Table S3 ). However, a two-way model is a significantly better fit than a one-way model (pnest < 0.05). In this two-way model, Baojianshan is significantly better modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related (72%) and Hòabìnhian-related (28%) ancestries ( Table S3 ). This is consistent with f 4 -statistics where Baojianshan has an affiliation with both Dushan and the Hòabìnhian.
Layi. In a one-way model, Layi shares ancestry with Liangdao2 (p = 0.11, Table S3). In a two-way model, however, Layi is significantly better modeled as a mixture of Boshan-related ancestry (22%–27%) and either Longlin-related (78%) or Dushan-related (73%) ancestry ( Table S3 ). Thus, Layi possesses ancestry found in prehistoric Guangxi individuals, with an additional 22% to 27% northern East Asian ancestry.
Shenxian. Shenxian can only be modeled with two sources. Shenxian is best modeled as a mixture of northern East Asian-related ancestry (9%–22%) and southern East Asian-related ancestry (78%–91%, Table S3 ), suggesting Shenxian also has a northern East Asian component. Unlike Layi, a prehistoric Guangxi population is not needed to model Shenxian’s ancestry.
Yiyang. Yiyang can be modeled using a single source when using Liangdao2 (p = 0.10, Table S3 ). Like Shenxian, Yiyang can be modeled as a mixture of northern East Asian (18%–42%), and southern East Asian (Liangdao2, 58%–83%) ancestry. However, Yiyang can also be modeled as a mixture of northern East Asian-related ancestry (27%–42%) and Dushan-related ancestry (58%–73%, Table S3 ).
BaBanQinCen. Only three-way models show feasible combinations for BaBanQinCen, where BaBanQinCen can be described as a mixture of ancestry related to Dushan (5%–64%), northern East Asians (19%–40%) and southern East Asians (5%–72%, Table S3 ). Like for other historical Guangxi populations, this is consistent with an affiliation to the admixed Dushan (southern East Asian and Longlin-related ancestries) and northern East Asians observed in other analyses. The proportions of Dushan- and southern East Asian-related (e.g., Qihe3, Liangdao2) ancestry vary, possibly because qpAdm cannot easily differentiate the southern East Asian ancestry found in Dushan from that found in coastal southern East Asians.
LaCen. LaCen, like Layi, can only be modeled using a 2-way approach, where LaCen is best modeled as a mixture of northern East Asian ancestry (22%–30%) and Dushan-related ancestry (70%–78%, Table S3 ).
GaoHuaHua. GaoHuaHua, like LaCen and Layi, is also best modeled through a 2-way approach. The best model is one where GaoHuaHua is a mixture of northern East Asian ancestry (Boshan, 34%) and Dushan-related ancestry (66%, Table S3 ).
We targeted previously published ancient southern East Asians and Southeast Asians, to estimate the genetic contribution of prehistoric Guangxi populations in the neighboring region. Since the data quality would influence the power of the modeling, here we reported results for populations with greater than 100,000 SNPs.
We found that applying a two-source model to ancient southern East Asians and Southeast Asians led to feasible admixture models that were significantly better than one-way models with either Longlin- or Hòabìnhian-related ancestry. In the mixture models, G4, La_G2, Ma912_G2, Oakaie1, Vt_G2, Vt778_G4_1 are best modeled as a mixture of Longlin-related ancestry (57%–94%) and northern East Asian-related ancestry (6%–43%). In addition, Oakaie1, Vt778_G4_1, Nui_Nap, Chuanyun, and G3 can be modeled as mixture of Dushan-related ancestry and northern East Asian ancestry. Finally, Ma912_G2 and Vt_G2 can also be modeled as a mixture of Longlin-related ancestry and southern East Asian-related ancestry (Qihe3, Liangdao2).
Interestingly, Man_Bac, who we found in f 4 -analyses to have a connection to prehistoric Guangxi individuals, is best modeled as a mix of Dushan-related ancestry (65.8%) and Longlin-related ancestry (34.2%, Table S3 ), with no ancestry specific to southern or northern East Asians. Man_Bac can also be fit as primarily Dushan-related ancestry with some IndusPeriphery-related ancestry (3.5%, Table S3 ), which suggests that Dushan-related ancestry is the primary contributor to Man_Bac.
Vt_G2 also can be modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related ancestry (19%) and Longlin-related ancestry (81%, Table S3 ). However, like the connection with Hòabìnhian we see in f 4 -statistics, Vt_G2 also can be modeled as containing 9%–19% Hòabìnhian-related ancestry admixed with 81%–91% southern East Asian-related ancestry (Liangdao2, Qihe3, Table S3 ). Similarly, G5 is best modeled as a mix of southern East Asian-related ancestry (Qihe3, 67%) and Hòabìnhian-related (34%, Table S3 ), which is consistent with the contribution of Hòabìnhians mentioned in a previous study ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We did not observe a plausible three-way model for any ancient southern East Asians or Southeast Asians with Longlin or Dushan as a potential source, but some four-way models were possible and significantly better than lower-ordered models. Both Late Neolithic Fujian populations Xitoucun and Tanshishan are best modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related ancestry (35/54%), northern East Asian ancestry (44/34%), Qihe3-related ancestry (17/8%) and IndusPeriphery-related ancestry (4/3%, Table S3 ).
Of present-day populations, only Mlabri, Cambodian, Thai, and Burmese can be modeled as having ancestry related to prehistoric Guangxi individuals. Cambodian, Mlabri, and Thai can be modeled as a three-way mixture of Longlin-related, Liangdao2-related, and DevilsCave_N-related ancestries ( Table S3 ). Mlabri can also be modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related, DevilsCave_N-related, and Hòabìnhian-related ancestries. For the Burmese, we observe that the best model uses four sources – Dushan or Longlin, DevilsCave_N, Hòabìnhian, and IndusPeriphery or Jōmon ( Table S3 ).
Based on the qpAdm results, we can see that prehistoric Guangxi populations profoundly influenced later populations, though this contribution is considerably less in later periods. In fact, several previously published Southeast Asians primarily associated with the deep lineage related to Hòabìnhians ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) can be better described as a mixture of northern East Asian, southern East Asian, and prehistoric Guangxi ancestry. Furthermore, some previously published Southeast Asians with deep ancestry ( Lipson et al., 2018 37. Lipson, M. ∙ Cheronet, O. ∙ Mallick, S. ... Ancient genomes document multiple waves of migration in Southeast Asian prehistory Science. 2018; 361 :92-95 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as Man_Bac, can be better modeled with prehistoric Guangxi-related ancestry as the source, rather than Hòabìnhian-related ancestry. For present-day populations, the contributions of both prehistoric Guangxi-related and Hòabìnhian-related ancestries are limited. In summary, the qpAdm analyses here reveals the diverse and complicated genetic picture in southern China and Southeast Asia, and the important role Guangxi ancestry played within this region.
We modeled the relationship between populations using qpGraph in ADMIXTOOLS ( Patterson et al., 2012 56. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1550) PubMed Google Scholar ), with allsnps:YES. To build an Admixture Graph Model, we added samples chronologically, where each sample’s best fitting node or set of two nodes (admixture) are cataloged. Then, the set of best fitting models including that sample is used as the base graph for adding the next set of samples. We began with a basic model that included the Central African Mbuti, the early European Kostenki14 ( Seguin-Orlando et al., 2014 73. Seguin-Orlando, A. ∙ Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Sikora, M. ... Paleogenomics. Genomic structure in Europeans dating back at least 36,200 years Science. 2014; 346 :1113-1118 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), the early Asian Tianyuan ( Yang et al., 2017 83. Yang, M.A. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Theunert, C. ... 40,000-year-old individual from Asia provides insight into early population structure in Eurasia Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :3202-3208.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the 7,950-7,795 year old Hòabìnhian Hunter-gatherer La368 ( McColl et al., 2018 48. McColl, H. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Vinner, L. ... The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia Science. 2018; 361 :88-92 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) (denoted as G1, Figure S4 A).
We first added the Late Paleolithic individual Longlin, and found the only feasible model positioned Longlin on the East Eurasian lineage, with Tianyuan. Even though the tree showed limited shared ancestry between Hòabìnhian and Longlin ( Figure S4 B), it is also likely the relationship is defined by a polytomy as suggested in the f 4 - analysis using transversions only.
We then added different Neolithic East Asians in turn to the graph in Figure S4 C. Following chronologically, we first added those samples dating to before 8,000 years ago: the northern East Asian Boshan (∼8,300 BP ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar )), the southern East Asian Qihe (∼8,400 BP ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar )), and Dushan (8,974-8,593 cal BP), presented in this study. We show all feasible models (maximum |Z| < 3) in Figure S4 C. • Dushan can be modeled in two ways: a mixture of a lineage related to Tianyuan and a lineage related to Longlin ( Figure S4 C) or a mixture of Longlin-related ancestry and southern East Asian Qihe-related ancestry ( Figure S4 C). • Boshan can be modeled in two ways. One is clustering with Qihe, where their common ancestry was derived from Longlin-related and Tianyuan-related ancestry ( Figure S4 C). In the second, Boshan received ancestry from a Dushan-related or Qihe-related lineage, and from a population that is deeply diverged ( Figure S4 C). • Qihe in most cases clusters with Boshan ( Figure S4 C), but in some cases Qihe can be modeled as a mixture of a Longlin-related lineage and a Dushan-related lineage ( Figure S4 C). In Figure S4 C, Qihe can be modeled as a mix of a Tianyuan-related ancestry and Longlin-related ancestry. Similarly, Qihe can be modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related ancestry with a Tianyuan-related ancestry.
Then, we added two later ancient East Asians dating to between 8,000 to 5,000 BP: Liangdao2 (∼7,600 BP) ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Baojianshan (8,335-6,400 BP). We found eight models that fit the observed patterns (maximum |Z| < 3, Figure S4 D). • In most models ( Figure S4 D), Liangdao2 forms a clade with Qihe, consistent with previous findings ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Liangdao2 can also be modeled as admixture of Qihe- and Boshan-related ancestry ( Figure S4 D), indicating Liangdao2 received more northern East Asian influence than Qihe, which is consistent with the qpAdm analysis. • Baojianshan can be modeled in three ways. First, Baojianshan can be fit as a mixture of ancestry related to Dushan and the Hòabìnhian G1 ( Figure S4 D). Second, Baojianshan can be described as sharing common ancestry with both northern and southern East Asians, but separating prior to the northern and southern divergence ( Figure S4 D). Third, Baojianshan can be modeled as a mixture of Longlin-related ancestry and the shared northern and southern East Asian ancestry ( Figure S4 D).
To these graphs, we next added Late Neolithic individuals who date to around 4,000 BP, i.e., Man_Bac (∼4,100 BP ( Lipson et al., 2018 37. Lipson, M. ∙ Cheronet, O. ∙ Mallick, S. ... Ancient genomes document multiple waves of migration in Southeast Asian prehistory Science. 2018; 361 :92-95 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar )) and Xitoucun (∼4,600 BP ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar )). We found two models that fit the data well with maximum |Z| < 3 ( Figure S4 E). • Xitoucun can be modeled as a mixture of Longlin-related and Qihe-related ancestry in both models ( Figure S4 E). • Man_Bac can be modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related ancestry and a southern East Asian-related ancestry. In some cases, Man_Bac is modeled directly as receiving ancestry from a southern East Asian-related population (Xitoucun, Figure S4 E). In other cases, Man_Bac is modeled as receiving ancestry from an admixed lineage related to Dushan, where Dushan always has a connection to southern East Asians ( Figure S4 E).
We provide possible models here without explicitly supporting a given model as the most accurate. Using these models, we summarize patterns regarding the complicated ancient genetic history of East Asia. • Longlin fits as a separate lineage sharing limited ancestry with the Hòabìnhian ( Figure S4 B). However, it is more likely the relationship was a polytomy based on an f 4 -analysis using transversions only. Longlin shares a closer relationship with later East Asian populations than with deep Asians (Tianyuan and Hòabìnhians, Figure S5 ).

(E-H) Pairwise residuals for the phylogenies for 0, 1, 2, and 3 migration events. Related to Figure 2 . • Dushan can be predominantly modeled as a mixture of Longlin-related and southern East Asian-related ancestry ( Figure S4 C). • Baojianshan fits as a mixture of Dushan-related and G1-related ancestry, consistent with results from f 4 -analysis ( Figure S4 D). • Liangdao2 mostly clusters with Qihe. However, in some cases Liangdao2 can be modeled as mixture of northern East Asian-related ancestry and Qihe-related ancestry, indicating a difference between Qihe and Liangdao2 ( Figure S4 D). • Man_Bac can be modeled as a mixture of Dushan-related and Qihe-related ancestry, consistent with the results described in f 4 -analysis. Furthermore, Man_Bac does not show evidence of Hòabìnhian-related ancestry ( Figure S4 E).
The phylogenetic relationships were determined by Treemix v1.13 ( Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012 62. Pickrell, J.K. ∙ Pritchard, J.K. Inference of population splits and mixtures from genome-wide allele frequency data PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002967 Crossref Scopus (1625) PubMed Google Scholar ). We rooted the tree by the Central African Mbuti, made blocks of 500 SNPs and used global rearrangements, i.e., the parameters “-root Mbuti –k 500 -global” were used, allowing 0, 1, 2, or 3 migration events ( m ). We ran 1,000 replicates for each tree, adding the options “-bootstrap -q.” Bootstrap trees were assessed in Phylip with the command “consense” ( Baum, 1989 4. Baum, B.R. PHYLIP: Phylogeny Inference Package. Version 3.2. Joel Felsenstein Q. Rev. Biol. 1989; 64 :539-541 Crossref Google Scholar ). Results are shown in Figures S5 A–S5D for m = 0 to m = 3, and m = 3 is shown in Figure 2 A with a visualization of the residuals in Figure S5 H. Here, the Hòabìnhian La368 is represented by the label G1.
When m = 0 , Longlin is an outgroup to southern East Asians, northern East Asians, Dushan, and Baojianshan. Longlin clusters with them relative to Tianyuan and the Onge/G1 clade (Hòabìnhian-related clade). Baojianshan clusters with Dushan. After allowing m = 1 , a migration event occurred between Tianyuan and the northern East Asians DevilsCave_N and Yumin. When m = 2 , both Dushan and Baojianshan received gene flow from a Longlin-related population. When m = 3 , Baojianshan received gene flow from the Hòabìnhian-related clade.
In qpAdm analyses, we found historical Guangxi populations possess partial northern East Asian ancestry, with the mixture proportion estimated to ∼20% in qpAdm. To understand which northern East Asians sampled thus far best represent the source population(s), we compared historical Guangxi populations with previously published ancient northern East Asians: Early Neolithic Shandong individuals ( Yang et al., 2020 84. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), Neolithic Mongolians ( Wang et al., 2021 80. Wang, C.-C. ∙ Yeh, H.-Y. ∙ Popov, A.N. ... Genomic insights into the formation of human populations in East Asia Nature. 2021; 591 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ), Primorye populations ( Sikora et al., 2019 76.

The population history of northeastern Siberia since the Pleistocene Nature. 2019; 570 :182-188 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ), Amur River populations ( Ning et al., 2020 54. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), West Liao River populations ( Ning et al., 2020 54. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Central Plain populations ( Ning et al., 2020 54. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We first calculated the outgroup f 3 -statistic, f 3 (X, Y; Mbuti) to measure the shared drift between historical Guangxi populations and ancient northern East Asians listed above. We found that of all ancient northern East Asians tested, northern populations from Early Neolithic Shandong and Central Plain populations share the most genetic drift with historical Guangxi populations. These Shandong populations date to ∼9,500-8,000 years ago, representing the oldest samples among northern East Asians who share high genetic drift with historical Guangxi populations ( Figure 3 B).
To confirm the connection between historical Guangxi (GX) populations with ancient Shandong populations (EN_SD), we performed f 4 (Mbuti, historical GX; X, Y) where Y are ancient Shandong populations and X are all other ancient northern East Asians ( Table S2 ). This comparison allows us to assess in which specific instances historical Guangxi populations share more alleles with the ancient Shandong populations than other ancient northern East Asians. Our results show that the historical Guangxi populations share a closer relationship to ancient Shandong populations than ancient northern East Asians from the Amur River region, West Liao River region, Coastal Siberia, and Mongolia, as most f 4 (Mbuti, historical GX; X, EN_SD ) > 0 (−1.1 < Z < 10.6, Table S2 ).
In particular, the strongest affiliation is with the 7,900-year-old Xiaojingshan population from Shandong, who shows a connection to the historical Guangxi individuals even relative to other ancient Shandong populations, i.e., f 4 (Mbuti, historical GX; Xiaojingshan, other EN_SD ) tends negative, and is significantly negative when the historical Guangxi population is the 500-year-old Gaohuahua ( Table S2 ). When compared with ancient populations from the Central Plain region, we found that most f 4 (Mbuti, historical GX; ancient Central Plain, EN_SD )∼0 ( Table S2 ), suggesting that ancient Central Plain populations and ancient Shandong populations are similarly related to historical Guangxi populations. The Central Plain populations are younger than the Shandong populations, and they also show evidence of southern East Asian-related ancestry ( Ning et al., 2020 54. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the northern East Asian ancestry most associated with historical Guangxi populations is that related to Early Neolithic Shandong individuals and ancient populations from the Central Plain.
To estimate introgressed archaic fragments in ancient Guangxi populations, we used admixfrog ( Peter, 2020 61. Peter, B.M. 100,000 years of gene flow between Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.2003.2013.990523 Google Scholar ) (version 0.5.6, https://github.com/BenjaminPeter/admixfrog/ ). Admixfrog is capable of inferring introgressed segments from highly degraded and contaminated data ( Peter, 2020 61. Peter, B.M. 100,000 years of gene flow between Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.2003.2013.990523 Google Scholar ). Using this software, we modeled target individuals as a mixture of three different sources: two high-coverage Neanderthal genomes (the high coverage Altai ( Prüfer et al., 2014 66. Prüfer, K. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Patterson, N. ... The complete genome sequence of a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains Nature. 2014; 505 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (1437) PubMed Google Scholar ) and and Vindija ( Prüfer et al., 2017 67. Prüfer, K. ∙ de Filippo, C. ∙ Grote, S. ... A high-coverage Neandertal genome from Vindija Cave in Croatia Science. 2017; 358 :655-658 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ) Neanderthal genomes, NEA), one high-coverage Denisova genome (Denisova 3, DEN, ( Meyer et al., 2012 50. Meyer, M. ∙ Kircher, M. ∙ Gansauge, M.T. ... A high-coverage genome sequence from an archaic Denisovan individual Science. 2012; 338 :222-226 Crossref Scopus (1280) PubMed Google Scholar )), and 44 genomes of present-day Sub-Saharan Africans from the Simons Genome Diversity Panel ( Mallick et al., 2016 41. Mallick, S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Lipson, M. ... The Simons Genome Diversity Project: 300 genomes from 142 diverse populations Nature. 2016; 538 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ) (AFR). We used the “1240k” SNP panel to infer the archaic introgressed fragments in the given target genome.
We first converted the target individuals from the BAM file format to the input file format for admixfrog , with the command ‘–length-bin-size 35 –minmapq 25–deam-cutoff 3′. These parameters filter BAM files for fragments of at least 35 base pairs (bp), mapping quality greater than 25, and remove the deamination of C→T substitution at the first three and/or the last three bases. Then, using these input files, we ran the analysis to infer introgressed archaic fragments. The potential sources were set to be Africans, Neanderthals, or Denisovans (–states AFR NEA DEN). The chimpanzee ( panTro4 ) reference genome was used to infer the ancestral state of each allele (–ancestral PAN). The bin size for every individual was set to 5,000 bp (–bin-size 5000). Other parameters were configured using default options ( Peter, 2020 61. Peter, B.M. 100,000 years of gene flow between Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.2003.2013.990523 Google Scholar ).
Individuals with less than 200,000 SNPs (marked in gray) gave the highest and lowest archaic proportions, likely because their low number of SNPs skews the estimates for these samples. Other ancient Guangxi individuals with greater than 200,000 SNPs gave estimates ranging from 0.5%–2.5% for Denisovan introgressed segments and 1.9%–5.2% for Neanderthal introgressed segments ( Table S2 ). None of the results indicated archaic ancestry above that, which has been shown for similarly dated individuals from this region ( Green et al., 2010 22. Green, R.E. ∙ Krause, J. ∙ Briggs, A.W. ... A draft sequence of the Neandertal genome Science. 2010; 328 :710-722 Crossref Scopus (2786) PubMed Google Scholar ; Prüfer et al., 2014 66. Prüfer, K. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Patterson, N. ... The complete genome sequence of a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains Nature. 2014; 505 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (1437) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although the cranial morphology of Longlin shows a mixture of archaic-related features, she does not have extra archaic ancestry proportions greater than that found in similarly dated samples with more typically modern human morphological features. Our analysis suggests that Longlin does not show high archaic-related ancestry. Thus, these features are possibly retained within the variation found among early modern humans, without necessarily implicating a direct link to archaic humans. One possible explanation for the different morphological and genetic results is that the archaic ancestor contributing to Longlin is currently unknown and not closely related to Neanderthal or Denisovan ancestries. As the analysis depends on reference populations to use as admixture sources, we may not be able to detect unknown archaic ancestry.
