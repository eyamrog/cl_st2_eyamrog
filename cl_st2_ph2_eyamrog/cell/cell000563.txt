Title: Non-cell-autonomous disruption of nuclear architecture as a potential cause of COVID-19-induced anosmia


Abstract: Summary

SARS-CoV-2 infects less than 1% of cells in the human body, yet it can cause severe damage in a variety of organs. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Neurological and cognitive defects are among the least understood symptoms of COVID-19 patients, with olfactory dysfunction being their most common sensory deficit. Here, we show that both in humans and hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) and of their signaling components. This non-cell-autonomous effect is preceded by a dramatic reorganization of the neuronal nuclear architecture, which results in dissipation of genomic compartments harboring OR genes. Our data provide a potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the cellular morphology and the transcriptome of cells it cannot infect, offering insight to its systemic effects in olfaction and beyond.

Section: Introduction

Neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients have immense importance due to their role in exacerbating initial disease presentation and their persistence ( Chippa et al., 2021 17.

Early studies correlated higher propensity for acute olfactory loss with a more indolent course, but subsequent work suggested elevated prevalence of smell loss across most COVID-19 cases ( Garrigues et al., 2020 30.

Usually, smell loss is transient, with patients recovering over 6 weeks. However, for ∼10% of patients, this resolution is elusive, resulting in persistent olfactory dysfunction ( Boscolo-Rizzo et al., 2022 7. Boscolo-Rizzo, P. ∙ Guida, F. ∙ Polesel, J. ...

Although olfactory deficits are common in upper respiratory infections, these symptoms are accompanied by rhinorrhea and nasal congestion that insulate olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) from odorants. In contrast, anosmia in COVID-19 is independent from conductive interference. Thus, the association between COVID-19 and anosmia raises mechanistic questions, as OSNs do not express host cell entry proteins ( Bilinska et al., 2020 5.

To gain insight into COVID-19-induced anosmia, we explored the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamster and human autopsies of the olfactory epithelium (OE). Experiments in hamsters revealed transient recruitment of various immune cells to the OE and rapid upregulation of antiviral genes in OSNs. Further, scRNA-seq revealed preferential SARS-CoV-2 infection and transient depletion of sustentacular (SUS) cells, followed by their restoration by day 10 post-infection (dpi). Although we do not detect OSN depletion, we report significant downregulation of olfactory receptor (OR) genes and of key genes of the OR signaling pathway. OR gene downregulation is preceded by rapid and persistent reorganization of nuclear architecture and disruption of genomic OR compartments. Analysis of human OE autopsies confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with significant decrease of OR and OR signaling gene transcription and reduction of interchromosomal OR contacts. Effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nuclear architecture are non-cell autonomous and can be induced by neutralized serum from SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. Our data provide a potential explanation for the neurological symptoms caused by a virus with no tropism for neurons.

Section: Results

To explore mechanisms of COVID-19-induced anosmia, we infected golden hamsters ( M. auratus ) with SARS-CoV2 and monitored changes over a period of 10 days post-infection (dpi) by scRNA-seq. This rodent species is a good animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to sequence homology between hamster and human ACE2 and similarity in pathogenesis and immunological responses ( Cleary et al., 2020 18.

Pathogenesis and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in golden hamsters Nature. 2020; 583 :834-838 Crossref Scopus (916) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed scRNA-seq at mock and SARS-CoV-2-infected OEs at 1, 3, and 10 dpi. We analyzed a total of 68,951 cells and identified 13 cell types ( Figure S1 A) using previously described markers ( Durante et al., 2020 24. Durante, M.A. ∙ Kurtenbach, S. ∙ Sargi, Z.B. ...

Deconstructing olfactory stem cell trajectories at single-cell resolution Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20 :817-830.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). We detect a decrease of SUS cells at 1 dpi that is exaggerated at 3 dpi ( Figures 1 A and 1B), when SUS representation decreases from 20.6% in mock-infected hamsters to 6% at 3 dpi. SUS diminution coincides with increase of microglia and other immune cells ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Both SUS and microglia return to pre-infection representation in the hamster OE by 10 dpi ( Figures 1 A and 1B). In contrast, OSN representation is stable throughout the infection ( Figures 1 A and 1B).
At 1 and 3 dpi, we detect the viral RNA in ∼5% of the cells, followed by complete elimination of the virus at 10 dpi. At 1 dpi, 47% of the total infected cells are SUS, and ∼40% of which are infected ( Figures 1 C–1E and S1 B). In contrast, only 6% of the infected cells are OSNs ( Figures 1 C, 1E, and S1 B). At 3 dpi, microglia and other immune cells also frequently contain SARS-CoV-2 transcripts ( Figures 1 C–1E and S1 B). Consistent with this, we detect colocalization of spike protein with Krt18 and with Aif1/lba-1, SUS and microglia markers, respectively ( Figures S1 C and S1E). Spike colocalization with OSN markers is rare and occurs at OE regions of viral shedding and structural damage ( Figures S1 C and S1E). Finally, SARS-CoV-2 presence in OSN axons innervating the olfactory bulb (OB) is rare, consistent with the infrequent OSN infection in the OE ( Figure S1 D).
To identify transcriptional changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first analyzed SUS cells, which are directly infected by this virus. There are significant differences between mock and infected SUS cells at 1 and 3 dpi, with the viral RNAs representing the most enriched genes in the infected samples ( Figure 2 A). If we split the SUS cells of the infected OEs into SARS-CoV-2 + and SARS-CoV-2 − populations, we detect upregulation of cytokines and chemokines and downregulation of SUS-specific markers in the SARS-CoV-2 + cells ( Figure 2 B), consistent with cell-autonomous transcriptional consequences induced by infection.
Since SARS-CoV-2 infects OSNs infrequently, we asked if the infection elicits non-cell-autonomous transcriptional changes in these neurons. Indeed, OSNs activate antiviral responses at 3 dpi ( Figures 2 C and S2 ). By 10 dpi, transcription of antiviral genes is reduced, concomitantly with the clearance of the virus from the OE. Importantly, genes essential for the sense of smell, such as Adcy3, are significantly downregulated in OSNs at 3 dpi ( Figure 2 D). Consistent with this, Adcy3 RNA ISH and IF show significant reduction of Adcy3 mRNA and protein at infected hamster OEs, even in regions with little detectable virus ( Figures 2 E and 2F).
Our scRNA-seq analysis could not provide insight to the effects of the virus into OR expression because we used a 5′-based cDNA synthesis approach. This approach is most sensitive for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 but inadequate for detection OR mRNAs due to poor annotation in the hamster genome. To overcome this and to quantify rigorously transcriptional changes, we complemented our analysis with bulk RNA-seq. We collected infected OEs at 1, 2, 4, and 10 dpi. This approach confirmed high viral loads in the hamster OE that increase till 4 dpi before complete elimination by day 10 ( Figure 3 A). Downregulation of SARS-CoV-2 host entry factors suggests depletion of cells that can be infected by this virus ( Figure 3 B). Further, we detect strong upregulation of antiviral genes that last until 10 dpi ( Figure 3 C), consistent with observations in other tissues ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020 6. Blanco-Melo, D. ∙ Nilsson-Payant, B.E. ∙ Liu, W.C. ...

In addition to the aforementioned alterations, we detect an early wave of transient transcriptional changes in SUS cells and immediate neuronal precursors (INPs), followed by delayed, transcriptional changes in OSNs and globose basal cells (GBCs). Reduction in INP markers is mostly restricted to 2 dpi, including the downregulation of Lhx2, Ebf1, and Ebf2, transcription factors with key roles in expression of OR and OR signaling genes ( Hirota and Mombaerts, 2004 33. Hirota, J. ∙ Mombaerts, P. The LIM-homeodomain protein Lhx2 is required for complete development of mouse olfactory sensory neurons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 1997; 17 :4149-4158 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Downregulation of SUS markers starts at 2 dpi and peaks at 4 dpi before being restored to pre-infection levels by day 10 ( Figures 3 D and 3E). In contrast, OSN responses are delayed and persistent, with key molecules for olfaction, such as Adcy3 ( Wong et al., 2000 71. Wong, S.T. ∙ Trinh, K. ∙ Hacker, B. ... Disruption of the type III adenylyl cyclase gene leads to peripheral and behavioral anosmia in transgenic mice Neuron. 2000; 27 :487-497 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ), remaining downregulated through day 10 ( Figures 3 D and 3E). Finally, markers of OSN progenitor cells increase, with GBC markers peaking at 10 dpi ( Figures 3 D and 3E). This may reflect progenitor cell activation toward the replenishment of infected cells of the OE ( Fletcher et al., 2017 27. Fletcher, R.B. ∙ Das, D. ∙ Gadye, L. ...

Injury activates transient olfactory stem cell states with diverse lineage capacities Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 21 :775-790.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). A summary of other processes that may be affected at the early and late stages of the infection is shown in GSEA plots for 1 and 10 dpi ( Figure S3 ), and all the significant transcriptional changes are listed in Table S1 .
The most striking transcriptional change observed in infected OEs is the widespread downregulation of OR genes. Significant OR downregulation is first observed at 2 dpi, peaks at 4 dpi, and continues through 10 dpi ( Figures 3 F and 3H), when other OSN markers have recovered ( Figure 3 G). This pattern is distinct from the changes in the most variable genes in the OE, whose expression is fully restored by 10 dpi, or the changes observed in INPs and SUS cells ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Genes with critical role in olfaction follow the pattern of OR gene expression, as we also detect strong and significant downregulation of Adcy3, Gng13, Cnga2, Rtp1, and Gfy, at 4 dpi that is partially preserved till 10 dpi ( Figure 3 I). Some antiviral responses are also sustained till day 10 ( Figure 3 J).
To decipher mechanisms responsible for widespread and sustainable OR downregulation, we directed our studies to a known regulator of OR expression, the OSN nuclear architecture ( Bashkirova and Lomvardas, 2019 3.

Dev. 2019; 55 :106-113 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Clowney et al., 2012 19. Clowney, E.J. ∙ LeGros, M.A. ∙ Mosley, C.P. ...

OR gene clusters from multiple chromosomes converge to OSN-specific genomic compartments, which facilitate stable and singular OR transcription ( Clowney et al., 2012 19. Clowney, E.J. ∙ LeGros, M.A. ∙ Mosley, C.P. ... Nuclear aggregation of olfactory receptor genes governs their monogenic expression Cell. 2012; 151 :724-737 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore asked if disruption of OR compartments is the cause of OR downregulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We performed in situ HiC in hamster OEs from control (mock-infected) and SARS-CoV-2-infected samples at 1, 3, and 10 dpi. OR gene clusters form robust long-range cis and trans genomic contacts in hamster OSNs, as shown for OR genes from chromosomes 16 and 17 ( Figure 4 A). SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces these contacts, starting at 1 dpi and peaking at 3 dpi ( Figure 4 A). A contact matrix for all the hamster OR clusters arranged by chromosome shows strong long-range cis interactions and widespread trans contacts between them in control samples ( Figure 4 B). However, these interactions become reduced as early as 1 dpi and remain low by 10 dpi ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Hidden Markov model (HMM) calculation of genomic compartment scores shows widespread reduction of most compartments by 3 dpi, revealing a delayed disruption of genome-wide nuclear architecture compared with the disruption of OR compartments ( Figure 4 D). However, genomic compartmentalization remains disrupted 10 dpi, when the virus is already cleared from the OE.
Observations of widespread and persistent disruption of OSN genomic compartments is consistent with a non-cell-autonomous mechanism of nuclear reorganization. Since previous reports implicate cytokines and antiviral responses in olfactory deficits and OR downregulation ( Lane et al., 2005 41. Lane, A.P. ∙ Zhao, H. ∙ Reed, R.R. Development of transgenic mouse models for the study of human olfactory dysfunction Am. J. Rhinol. 2005; 19 :229-235 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar , 2010 40.

Innate immune signaling in the olfactory epithelium reduces odorant receptor levels: modeling transient smell loss in COVID-19 patients medRxiv. 2020; Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that we could disrupt trans OR contacts by imitating the systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection without the virus. We collected serum from mock and SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters at 3 dpi and inactivated the circulating virus by UV irradiation. We applied these sera to the OEs of naive hamsters by intranasal inoculation ( Figure 5 A). Strikingly, in situ HiC revealed significant reduction of trans OR contacts upon OE exposure to infected sera for 12.5 h ( Figures 5 B and 5C). HMM confirmed genome-wide changes in compartment scores between the two sample groups ( Figure 5 D). RNA-seq did not detect the viral genome on serum exposed OEs, confirming that we did not transfer active SARS-CoV-2 from infected to naive hamsters ( Figure 5 E). As expected from the infection time course, there are no significant changes in OR transcription at this time point ( Figure S4 A). However, there is a trend of OR downregulation across most OR genes, which is more pronounced than the effects observed at 1 dpi upon SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure S4 A). Thus, by providing sera from the peak of the inflammatory response, we likely accelerated the molecular changes observed during viral infection, consistent with the upregulation of genes induced 2 days post-SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure S4 B). SUS markers, however, are nonresponsive to the signals from the infected sera ( Figure S4 C), supporting the notion that SUS cells only exhibit mostly cell-autonomous transcriptional changes.
To explore whether our observations from hamsters apply to humans, we analyzed the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection of human OE autopsies. We identified a region at the roof of the nasal cavity bridging the superior septum and middle turbinate bones that is highly enriched for OSNs as demonstrated by detection of the mature OSN-specific olfactory marker protein (OMP) and the OSN-enriched LDB1 ( Figure S5 A). This is further supported by scRNA-seq analysis on an autopsy from a control (noninfected) sample ( Zazhytska et al., 2021 72. Zazhytska, M. ∙ Kodra, A. ∙ Hoagland, D.A. ... Disruption of nuclear architecture as a cause of COVID-19 induced anosmia bioRxiv. 2021; PubMed Google Scholar ). RNA ISH in section of OE autopsies from infected patients shows enrichment of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the non-neuronal layers of the OE ( Figure S5 B), consistent with recent observations ( Khan et al., 2021 39. Khan, M. ∙ Yoo, S.J. ∙ Clijsters, M. ... Visualizing in deceased COVID-19 patients how SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory and olfactory mucosae but spares the olfactory bulb Cell. 2021; 184 :5932-5949.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in microglia cells recruited to the infected human OEs ( Figure S5 C), replicating observations from hamster OEs. Finally, as in hamsters, we did not observe OSN depletion in infected OEs ( Figure S5 D).
Upon establishing histological similarities between hamster and human SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed bulk RNA-seq in 6 control and 18 infected human OE autopsies. Autopsies were donated from both male and female patients, representing a variety of ages, duration of infection, hospitalization, treatment, and post-mortem intervals ( Table S2 ). These variations did not influence cellular constitution, as quantification of OE, respiratory epithelium (RE), and immune cells show consistency between samples ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Post-mortem time (PMT) had no obvious effect on the quality of these libraries ( Figure S5 G). Surrogate variable analysis ( Leek, 2014 42. Leek, J.T. svaseq: Removing batch effects and other unwanted noise from sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ) identified one control sample as extreme outlier, resulting in its removal from further analyses ( Figure S5 I). The remaining samples were subjected to batch adjustment corrections using ComBat-seq ( Love et al., 2014 48. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45416) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2020 73. Zhang, Y. ∙ Parmigiani, G. ∙ Johnson, W.E. ComBat-seq: Batch effect adjustment for RNA-seq count data NAR Genom. Bioinform. 2020; 2 :lqaa078 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then were further analyzed.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in every infected OE, with variable amounts between samples ( Figure 6 A). However, representation of OE and RE markers did not change with viral load ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Unexpectedly, in one of the remaining five control samples, we detected the RNA genome of a non-SARS coronavirus, hCoV-OC43 ( Figure S5 H), which was previously shown to infect the RE and OE ( Dubé et al., 2018 21. Dubé, M. ∙ Le Coupanec, A. ∙ Wong, A.H.M. ... Axonal transport enables neuron-to-neuron propagation of human coronavirus OC43 J. Virol. 2018; 92 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). This sample, highlighted with light blue, was not pooled with control samples. We have information only on one patient about olfactory deficits (highlighted with striped bar) due to limited solicitation of these symptoms at the early phase of the pandemic. However, based on current reports, >60% of these subjects may have experienced olfactory deficits ( Butowt and von Bartheld, 2020 12. Butowt, R. ∙ von Bartheld, C.S. Anosmia in COVID-19: Underlying mechanisms and assessment of an olfactory route to brain infection Neuroscientist. 2020; 1073858420956905 PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 70. Wang, T.Z., Sell, J., Weiss, D., and Lall, R. (2020). COVID-19 presenting as anosmia and dysgeusia in New York City emergency departments, March - April 2020. medRxiv, 2020.2007.2006.20147751. Google Scholar ).
In most infected samples, we detected elevated levels of cytokines and antiviral genes such as IFN-γ ( Figures 6 B and S5 J). GO analysis of significantly upregulated genes between infected autopsies is overrepresented with terms related to immune response ( Figure S5 K). We did not detect an overall downregulation of SUS markers ( Figure 6 C), although some SUS-enriched genes are downregulated in the infected samples ( Figure 6 D). Similarly, we did not detect depletion of OSN markers, but selective reduction of OSN-enriched genes with established critical roles in olfaction, such as Adcy3 ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Control OEs have higher OR mRNA levels than the infected OEs ( Figure 6 E), except for the hCoV-OC43-infected control. PCA analysis using only OR genes, segregates control from infected samples, while PCA with the whole transcriptome does not ( Figures 6 F and 6G), suggesting that reduced OR transcription constitutes one of the few distinctive features between infected OEs. OR downregulation generally tracks with downregulation of Lhx2 and Ebf1/2, but two samples with low OR expression have high Lhx2 and Ebf1/2 expression ( Figure 6 G).
Comparisons between individual autopsies are replicated in comparisons of pooled control and infected samples. MA plots depicting the levels of OR genes (red), OE genes (blue), and RE genes (black) in control and infected samples, supports a bona fide transcriptional downregulation of OR genes, as OE and respiratory markers are not changing upon infection ( Figure 6 H). Volcano and boxplots showing the transcriptional effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in aggregate further support significant downregulation of OR and OR signaling genes ( Figures 6 I and 6J). Finally, GO analysis of downregulated genes in infected autopsies shows that “sensory perception of smell” constitutes the most significantly enriched GO term ( Figure 6 K).
To ask whether OR downregulation in SARS-CoV-2-infected OEs is caused by changes in nuclear architecture, we established a protocol for the isolation of OSN nuclei from OE autopsies by FACS ( Figure S6 A). In situ HiC on FAC-sorted nuclei confirmed that the OR-specific long-range cis and trans genomic contacts are conserved in humans ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Contact matrixes depicting human OR genes from every chromosome confirms that OR genes form interchromosomal compartments ( Figures 7 C and 7D) that are disrupted in SARS-CoV-2-infected OEs ( Figures 7 A–7D), independently of genome-wide changes in nuclear architecture ( Figure 7 E). Finally, we identified interchromosomal compartments containing Adcy3 and other genes with key functions in olfaction that also dissipate in infected samples ( Figure S6 B).

Section: Discussion

We provide a molecular explanation for SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia and a mechanism by which this virus can alter the identity and function of cells that lack entry receptors. Consistent with absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 from OSNs ( Bilinska et al., 2020 5. Bilinska, K. ∙ Jakubowska, P. ∙ Von Bartheld, C.S. ... Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in cells of the olfactory epithelium: Identification of cell types and trends with age ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2020; 11 :1555-1562 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ; Brann et al., 2020 9. Brann, D.H. ∙ Tsukahara, T. ∙ Weinreb, C. ... Non-neuronal expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfactory system suggests mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated anosmia Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2020 16. Chen, M. ∙ Shen, W. ∙ Rowan, N.R. ... Elevated ACE-2 expression in the olfactory neuroepithelium: implications for anosmia and upper respiratory SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication Eur. Respir. J. 2020; 56 Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar ), and recent histological analyses ( Khan et al., 2021 39. Khan, M. ∙ Yoo, S.J. ∙ Clijsters, M. ... Visualizing in deceased COVID-19 patients how SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory and olfactory mucosae but spares the olfactory bulb Cell. 2021; 184 :5932-5949.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ), our data suggest that OSN infection by SARS-CoV-2 is too infrequent to account for the reported smell loss. Moreover, the cell-autonomous effects of SUS infection may be too transient to account for long-lasting olfactory deficits reported by COVID-19 patients, which have a mean duration of ∼20 days ( Chapurin et al., 2022 14. Chapurin, N. ∙ Totten, D.J. ∙ Chaballout, B. ... Differential olfactory outcomes in COVID-19: A large healthcare system population study Int. Forum Allergy Rhinol. 2022; 12 :108-111 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the most likely explanation for COVID-19-induced anosmia is the non-cell-autonomous, widespread, and persistent downregulation of OR and OR signaling genes. The ability of the virus to alter the OSN transcriptome solves a puzzle that emerged from numerous studies in various organs: the virus is only infecting a small fraction of cells, yet it elicits devastating and often life-threatening physiological disruption ( Thakur et al., 2021 66. Thakur, K.T. ∙ Miller, E.H. ∙ Glendinning, M.D. ... COVID-19 neuropathology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital Brain. 2021; 144 :2696-2708 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). The demonstration that UV-neutralized serum from infected hamsters induces significant and rapid changes in OSN nuclear architecture suggests that systemic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection alter the physiology and function of the cells that this virus cannot infect.
Hamster scRNA-seq shows that SARS-CoV-2 predominantly infects SUS cells, resulting in cell-autonomous transcriptional changes and transient depletion of this cell population. In human OEs, where the viral load is lower, cell-autonomous transcriptional changes could not be detected by RNA-seq, probably due to infrequent SUS infection. However, these changes were detected by spatial transcriptomics that compared human OE regions with different viral loads ( Khan et al., 2021 39. Khan, M. ∙ Yoo, S.J. ∙ Clijsters, M. ... Visualizing in deceased COVID-19 patients how SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory and olfactory mucosae but spares the olfactory bulb Cell. 2021; 184 :5932-5949.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, in both hamster and human Oes, we detect strong, persistent, and widespread downregulation of OR genes as well as downregulation of Adcy3 and other key genes for odor perception, providing a plausible explanation for COVID-19-induced anosmia.
The insight afforded by hamster studies explains why spatial transcriptomics detected downregulation of SUS markers in human OE regions with high SARS-CoV-2 load but no reduction of OR and OR signaling molecules ( Khan et al., 2021 39. Khan, M. ∙ Yoo, S.J. ∙ Clijsters, M. ... Visualizing in deceased COVID-19 patients how SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory and olfactory mucosae but spares the olfactory bulb Cell. 2021; 184 :5932-5949.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). SUS marker downregulation is cell autonomous, thus expected to be stronger in regions with high viral load. In contrast, transcriptional changes in OSNs occur independently of direct infection and do not corelate with the viral load in the OE, hindering their elucidation by transcriptomic comparison within a sample. Furthermore, there is a delay in OSN transcriptional changes compared to SUS marker downregulation. Thus, autopsies corresponding to longer infection periods and comparison with noninfected samples may be required for the detection of OSN transcriptional changes by this elegant approach.
COVID-19-induced downregulation of Lhx2 and Ebf, key transcription factors for OSN physiology, explains the downregulation of a plethora of genes involved in odor perception. In hamsters, however, disruption of OR compartments precedes Lhx2/Ebf downregulation and persists after their restoration. Further, in two infected human OEs (146, 147), both OR transcription and OR compartmentalization are disrupted, while Lhx2 and Ebf levels are near control levels. Thus, although COVID-19-induced Lhx2/Ebf downregulation is likely to have major role in the downregulation of OR and OR signaling genes, widespread disruption of OR compartments may be the first insult in OSN physiology and, importantly, a form of “nuclear memory” that delays restoration of OR transcription. This is because OR compartments may form only during differentiation, and, thus, their disruption in mature OSNs may be irreversible. If OSNs cannot reactivate OR transcription, then the sense of smell in COVID-19 patients will recover only after these OSNs are replaced, a process that takes from weeks to months.
If OR contacts could be restored after the elimination of the virus, their pre and post-infection patterns may be different, due to the inherent stochasticity of trans OR interactions ( Bashkirova et al., 2020 4. Bashkirova, E. ∙ Monahan, K. ∙ Campbell, C.E. ... Homeotic regulation of olfactory receptor choice via NFI-dependent heterochromatic silencing and genomic compartmentalization bioRxiv. 2020; Google Scholar ; Tan et al., 2019 65.

Biol. 2019; 26 :297-307 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, OSNs that were already innervating a glomerulus may activate a different OR from the one originally chosen, resulting in odor misrepresentation in the OB and altered odor perception. This sensory confusion may also be exacerbated by Adcy3 downregulation as this molecule plays important roles in OSN axon guidance and the stabilization of OR expression ( Imai et al., 2006 37. Imai, T. ∙ Suzuki, M. ∙ Sakano, H. Odorant receptor-derived cAMP signals direct axonal targeting Science. 2006; 314 :657-661 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lyons et al., 2013 50.

Neurosci. 2007; 27 :6675-6683 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Long-term deficits in nuclear architecture could be applicable to other neuronal populations since adult CNS neurons also assemble long-range cis and trans genomic compartments between OR genes and other neuronal gene families ( Jiang et al., 2017 38. Jiang, Y. ∙ Loh, Y.E. ∙ Rajarajan, P. ... The methyltransferase SETDB1 regulates a large neuron-specific topological chromatin domain Nat.

Changes in genome architecture and transcriptional dynamics progress independently of sensory experience during post-natal brain development Cell. 2021; 184 :741-758.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional mechanisms, such as sustained expression of antiviral programs ( Frere et al., 2022 28. Frere, J.J. ∙ Serafini, R.A. ∙ Pryce, K.D. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection results in lasting and systemic perturbations post recovery bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), damage in tissue vasculature, and hypoxia ( Thakur et al., 2021 66. Thakur, K.T. ∙ Miller, E.H. ∙ Glendinning, M.D. ... COVID-19 neuropathology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital Brain. 2021; 144 :2696-2708 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ), could also contribute to long-lasting neurological deficits, including the loss of smell ( Lane et al., 2010 40. Lane, A.P. ∙ Turner, J. ∙ May, L. ... A genetic model of chronic rhinosinusitis-associated olfactory inflammation reveals reversible functional impairment and dramatic neuroepithelial reorganization J. Neurosci. 2010; 30 :2324-2329 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). In either case, the realization that the sense of smell relies on extremely “fragile” genomic interactions between chromosomes has important implications: if OR expression ceases every time maladaptive physiological responses disrupt interchromosomal OR contacts, then olfaction may act as the “canary in the coal mine” for a variety of human conditions, from viral infections to neurodegeneration ( Albers et al., 2006 1. Albers, M.W. ∙ Tabert, M.H. ∙ Devanand, D.P. Olfactory dysfunction as a predictor of neurodegenerative disease Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2006; 6 :379-386 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We did not identify the circulating molecule(s) that induce reorganization of OSN nuclear architecture and the OSN signaling pathway responsible for it. Thus, currently, we can only speculate that similar mechanisms apply to other neuronal populations, a concept that we have not explored. Furthermore, we did not establish that the reported downregulation in OR and OR signaling genes is responsible for COVID-19-induced anosmia, but we infer this from the phenotypes of knockout mice. Reduced expression of genes involved in every step of odor detection, such as receptor proteins (ORs) ( Buck and Axel, 1991 11. Buck, L. ∙ Axel, R. A novel multigene family may encode odorant receptors: A molecular basis for odor recognition Cell. 1991; 65 :175-187 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3906) PubMed Google Scholar ), olfactory receptor chaperones (Rtp1 and Rtp2) ( Saito et al., 2004 60. Saito, H. ∙ Kubota, M. ∙ Roberts, R.W. ... RTP family members induce functional expression of mammalian odorant receptors Cell. 2004; 119 :679-691 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ), olfactory receptor signaling molecules (Adcy3 and Gng13) ( Liu et al., 2018 47. Liu, Q. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Lu, C. ... G protein gamma subunit Ggamma13 is essential for olfactory function and aggressive behavior in mice NeuroReport. 2018; 29 :1333-1339 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wong et al., 2000 71. Wong, S.T. ∙ Trinh, K. ∙ Hacker, B. ... Disruption of the type III adenylyl cyclase gene leads to peripheral and behavioral anosmia in transgenic mice Neuron. 2000; 27 :487-497 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ion channels generating odor-evoked axon potential (Cnga2) ( Brunet et al., 1996 10. Brunet, L.J. ∙ Gold, G.H. ∙ Ngai, J. General anosmia caused by a targeted disruption of the mouse olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel Neuron. 1996; 17 :681-693 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ), provides the most likely explanation for COVID-19-induced anosmia. Finally, we can only deduce that COVID-19 infection caused OR and OR signaling gene downregulation in humans, as we cannot measure the expression of these genes before the infection. Although experiments in hamsters support this hypothesis, we cannot exclude rodent-specific mechanisms that preclude direct comparisons between species.

This study did not generate any materials and unique reagents.
LVG Golden Syrian hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ) were treated and euthanized in compliance with the rules and regulations of IACUC under protocol number PROTO202000113-20-0743. Only adult male hamsters were used for experiments. All experiments were performed on dissected olfactory epithelium tissue or on dissociated cells prepared from whole olfactory epithelium tissue. Dissociated cells were prepared using papain (Worthington Biochemical) and FAC-sorted as previously described.
Infectious work was performed at a CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. SARS-CoV-2 (clinical isolate UAS/WA1/2020) virus was propagated in Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 0.35% BSA. Infectious titer of virus was determined by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells using an overlay of Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco), 0.2%BSA (MP Biomedicals), 4mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 10mM HEPES (Fisher Scientific), 0.12% NaHCO 3 , 1% heat-inactivated FBS, and 0.7% Oxoid agar (Thermo Scientific). SARS-CoV-2 virus stocks used for hamster experiments were passage 3.
25 patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 at symptoms presentation and postmortem by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR analysis underwent full body autopsy at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (New York, NY, USA). The study was approved by the ethics and Institutional Review Board of Columbia University Medical Center (IRB AAAT0689, AAAS7370). Specimens noted to have metastatic cancer and non-SARS coronavirus were removed from further analysis. Brain tissue and nasal epithelium, including the olfactory region, were retrieved under a collaborative effort by the Department of Neuropathology and the Department of Otolaryngology. Tissues were obtained and preserved for histological, molecular, and microscopic evaluation using separate surgical instruments to prevent cross-contamination. 7 control specimens were collected in similar fashion from deceased individuals who had no clinical history of COVID-19 and had negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR at the time of their presentation and again prior to post-mortem dissection. Nasal tissues, including olfactory and respiratory epithelium were harvested from the skull base using an en-bloc resection of the anterior skull base including the cribriform plate. Olfactory epithelium was isolated from the olfactory cleft, spanning turbinate and adjacent septal mucosa prior to being preserved in 1% paraformaldehyde (for HiC), 4% paraformaldehyde (for RNA ISH/IF), or Trizol (for RNA-seq).
All hamster infections were performed in a BSL-3 animal facility at the Center for Comparative Medicine and Surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York, NY) using 4-6-week-old male golden hamsters purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Hamsters were intraperitonially administered anesthesia of ketamine/xylazine (3:1), [100mg/kg] before inoculation. Inoculations were performed by intranasally administering 100 plaque-forming units (pfu) in a total volume of 100ul per hamster, diluted in PBS. For infected serum experiments whole blood of mock and infected animal at 3dpi was centrifuged to extract serum following UV neutralization of any viral particles remained. Total volume of 100ul per animal was intranasally inoculated in the same fashion as virus administration. Golden hamsters were provided thermal support after infection until recovery from anesthesia. Before sacrifice, the animals were anesthetized and then perfused with 60mL of PBS through the heart.
The blood from a mock and 3dpi infected hamster with 100pfu of SARS-CoV-2 virus was collected from aorta upon euthanasia. Serum was separated via centrifugation following subsequent UV-C inactivation at dose of 100J/m2. Inoculations were performed into naïve hamsters by intranasally administering 100ul of mock or 3dpi inactivated serum per hamster upon anesthesia. 12.5h after serum inoculation hamsters were sacrificed, OE was dissociated and subjected for HiC and bulk RNA-seq.
RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA kits from Zymo Research. 50ng-1ug of total RNA was used to prepare DNA libraries with Truseq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 followed by 75 HO paired-end and multiplexed sequencing. Reads were aligned to human genome (hg38), Mesocricetus auratus (MesAur1.0) and SARS-CoV-2 (wuhCor1) using Subread ( Liao et al., 2013 45. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. The Subread aligner: Fast, accurate and scalable read mapping by seed-and-vote Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :e108 Crossref Scopus (1818) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the raw read counts were assembled using featureCounts pipeline( Liao et al., 2014 46. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: An efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (12543) PubMed Google Scholar ). Deseq2 was used to detect differences between conditions from the human samples and from the hamster biological replicates. Because of the inherent sources of biological and technical variability, we performed surrogate variable analysis to identify outliers between our samples for human samples. The Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA) was performed using the “sva” package in R( Leek, 2014 42. Leek, J.T. svaseq: Removing batch effects and other unwanted noise from sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of surrogate variables were estimated with the num.sv() function using the DESeq2-generated normalized counts and “model = ∼Covid19" (plus or minus)( Love et al., 2014 48. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45416) PubMed Google Scholar ). One variable was estimated using the default method. The svseq() was thus run with n.sv=1, and all samples exhibited a tight distribution, except sample “205”, which was an extreme outlier, and thus was excluded from subsequent analysis. The remaining 23 samples were subject to batch correction using Combat-seq( Zhang et al., 2020 73. Zhang, Y. ∙ Parmigiani, G. ∙ Johnson, W.E. ComBat-seq: Batch effect adjustment for RNA-seq count data NAR Genom. Bioinform. 2020; 2 :lqaa078 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, Deseq2 was used to determine the transcriptional consequences of COVID-19 infection in these autopsies and hamster samples. Two biological replicates were used for 1dpi and three biological replicates were used for control, 2dpi, 4dpi and 10 dpi. Z-score expression was calculated for each gene on DeSeq VS-transformed data (Variance Stabilizing Transformation) across samples in humans and across all time points in hamster. Heatmaps were generated using R function pheatmap(). Aggregated OR expression refers to the sum of all counts for annotated OR genes in each species.
Sequencing reads from sample 2186 were mapped to the human genome using STAR, and unmapped reads were output using the “--outReadsUnmapped Fastx” parameter( Dobin et al., 2013 20. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: Ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25623) PubMed Google Scholar ). These reads were then provided as input into “megahit”, a short read assembly algorithm using default settings. The resultant contig assemblies were blasted against the NCBI nucleotide collection using “blast+” command line tools. Blast results were filtered for “virus” in the “sskingdom” output format variable. hCoV-OC43 was the only human virus identified in the sample. Unmapped reads from STAR were then aligned to the hCoV-OC43 genome (ACC: NC_006213) using bwa, converted to bam, sorted, and indexed using SAMtools, and visualized using IGV.
Cells were dissociated according to the Worthington Papain Dissociation System by incubating fresh olfactory tissue with papain and Calcein VIolet for 40 min at 37 °C. Following dissociation, the live Celcein Violet-positive cells were sorted (MACSQuant Tyto cell sorter - Miltenyi Biotech) and assayed for scRNA-seq. Library preparation was performed accordingly to Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ v.3 Protocol for human samples and Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v.2 Protocol for hamster, respectively, and sequenced on NextSeq. Cell Ranger pipelines were used to generate fastq files which subsequently were aligned against hybrid hg38/ wuhCor1 and MesAur1.0/ wuhCor1 genomes. After alignment resulting in 8 datasets Cellbender ( Fleming et al., 2019 26. Fleming, S.J. ∙ J., C.M. ∙ Babadi, M. CellBender remove-background: A deep generative model for unsupervised removal of background noise from scRNA-seq datasets bioRxiv. 2019; Google Scholar ) was used to model and remove systematic biases and background noise, and to remove empty droplets. Post Cellbender h5 matrixes of 8 samples were aggregated into Seurat ( Stuart et al., 2019 63. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6795) PubMed Google Scholar ) object using Read10X() function. Cells with more than 400 UMIs, expressed 500 and 6000 genes and less than 5% of mitochondrial genes were kept for further analysis. Data were normalized using LogNormalize() function with scale factor of 10,000. FindVariableFeatures() function with 2000 genes and the selection method set to “vst” was used to find variable features. To identify integration anchor genes among the 8 samples the FindIntegrationAnchors() function was used with 30 principal components and 2000 genes, then with IntegrateData() all data was combined into one Seurat object. The data was scaled using the ScaleData() function. Then PCA analysis was performed to reduce dimensionality and the first 30 principal components were used UMAP plots. The number pf PC was chosen based on JackStraw and elbow plots. Clustering was performed using FindClusters() function. Identified 13 clusters were visualized with UMAP (tSNE in case of human samples) and annotated using known marker genes for each cell type. Differential expression analysis was performed using the default two-sided non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni correction using all genes in the dataset.
Dissected tissue was fixed in freshly prepared 4% PFA for 24 hrs at 4C and soaked sequentially at 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose 1X PBS for cryopreservation. The tissue was embedded in OCT and 10 um thick sections were mounted on SUPERFROS Plus Gold slides. To detect the S gene transcripts of SarsCov2, RNAscope® Probe - V-nCoV2019-S-sense, cat no. 845708, was incubated for 2 hr at 40C, in pre-treated sections as indicated by the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescenct v2 Assay kit. Zeiss Zen2012 SP1 (v8.1.9.484) was used for capturing confocal images. Same conditions were applied for detection of RNAscope® Probe for Hs-ADCY3(cat no. 441671) and Hs-ATF5 (cat no. 507471). Autofluorescence of the human OE sections was removed post-acquisition using ImageJ add-on function Autofluorescence Identifier (AFid) ( Baharlou et al., 2019 2. Baharlou, H. ∙ Canete, N.P. ∙ Bertram, K.M. ... AFid: A tool for automated identification and exclusion of autofluorescent objects from microscopy images bioRxiv. 2019; Google Scholar ). If followed by immunofluorescence, tissue was permeabilized with 1XPBS 0.1% Triton X 100 and blocked in a solution of 4% Donkey serum and 1x PBS 0.1% Triton X 100 for 30 minutes at RT, before incubation with primary antibodies for 2 hrs at RT at the concentrations described below.
Dissected tissue was fixed in freshly prepared 4% PFA for 24 hrs at 4C. OE was embedded in OCT and coronal cryosections were collected at a thickness of 12μm in human specimens. In hamster, OE and OB were similarly embedded in OCT and sagittal cryosections were collected at a thickness of 8-12μm. Antigen retrieval was performed with 0.01M citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes at 99C. Sections were rinsed in PBS and after permeabilization with 1x PBS 0.1% Triton X 100, slides were incubated in blocking solution (4% donkey serum +5% nonfat dry milk + 4% BSA + 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 minutes at RT. Tissue sections were stained with primary antibodies against OMP( Chen et al., 2005 15. Chen, H. ∙ Kohno, K. ∙ Gong, Q. Conditional ablation of mature olfactory sensory neurons mediated by diphtheria toxin receptor J. Neurocytol. 2005; 34 :37-47 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) (1:50 dilution) and NP (1:200 dilution, MyBiosource cat no. MBS8574840), Anti-Iba1 (1:250 dilution, Abcam cat no. ab178846). Nuclei were labeled with DAPI (2.5 μg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific cat no. D3571), Anti-Cytokeratin 18 (1:250, EMD Millipore cat no. MAB3234), Anti-Adcy3 (1:250, Abcam cat no. ab123803). Primary antibodies were labeled with the following secondary antibodies: for OMP, anti-chicken IgG conjugated to Alexa-488 (2 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch cat no. A-11055, RRID: AB_2534102 ), for Adcy3, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa-555 (2 μg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific cat no. 703-545-155, RRID: AB_2340375 ), for cyto-Krt18, anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa-488 (2 μg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific cat no. A-212-2, RRID: AB_2340375 ). Confocal images were collected with a Zeiss LSM 700 and image processing was carried out with Fiji (NIH).
Frozen 1% PFA-fixed tissue was mechanically crushed using Covaris Impactor and then nuclei were extracted with OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium according to the Sigma Millipore protocol. Following extraction and filtering two times through a 35-μm cell strainer, nuclei were stained with Lhx2/Atf5 antibodies for human samples. Next DAPI/Lhx2/Atf5 triple positive nuclei were sorted on a BD Aria II or BD Influx cell sorter for HiC experiments.
Depending on the sample, between 30 and 100 thousand nuclei were used for in situ Hi-C. Sorted nuclei were lysed and processed through an in situ Hi-C protocol as previously described with a few modifications. In brief, cells were lysed with 10 mM Tris pH 8 0.2% Igepal, 10 mM NaCl. Pelleted intact nuclei were then resuspended in 0.5% SDS and incubated for 20 min at 62 °C for nuclear permeabilization. After being quenched with 1.1% Triton-X for 10 min at 37 °C, nuclei were digested with 25 U/μl MseI in 1× CutSmart buffer for 1.5 hours at 37 °C. Following digestion, the restriction enzyme was inactivated at 62 °C for 20 min. For the 45-min fill-in at 37 °C, biotinylated dUTP was used instead of dATP to increase ligation efficiency. Ligation was performed at 25 °C for 30 min with rotation after which nuclei were centrifuges. To degrade proteins and revers crosslinks pellets were incubated overnight at 75 °C with proteinase K. Each sample was transferred to Pre-Slit Snap-Cap glass mictoTUBE and sonicated on a Covaris S220 for 90 sec.
Sonicated DNA was purified with 2× Ampure beads following the standard protocol and eluted in 300 μl water. Biotinylated fragments were enriched as previously described using Dynabeads MyOne Strepavidin T1 beads. The biotinylated DNA fragments were prepared for next-generation sequencing directly on the beads by using the Nugen Ovation Ultralow kit protocol as described ( Monahan et al., 2019 52. Monahan, K. ∙ Horta, A. ∙ Lomvardas, S. LHX2− and LDB1-mediated trans interactions regulate olfactory receptor choice Nature. 2019; 565 :448-453 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA was amplified by 7 cycles of PCR. Beads were reclaimed and amplified unbiotinylated DNA fragments were purified with 1× Ampure beads. The quality and concentration of libraries were assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer and Qubit Quantification Kit. Hi-C libraries were sequenced paired-end on NextSeq 500 (2 × 75 bp), or NovaSeq 6000 (2 × 150 bp).
Raw fastq files were processed using the Juicer single CPU BETA version on AWS. Human data were aligned against hg19 and hamster reads were aligned to MesAur1.0_HiC.fasta.gz using BWA 0.7.17 mem algorithm. Hamster genome assembly was obtained from the DNA Zoo Consortium( Dudchenko et al., 2017 22. Dudchenko, O. ∙ Batra, S.S. ∙ Omer, A.D. ... De novo assembly of the Aedes aegypti genome using Hi-C yields chromosome-length scaffolds Science. 2017; 356 :92-95 Crossref Scopus (1189) PubMed Google Scholar ) and polished with generated HiC data for mock hamster. After reads are aligned, merged, and sorted, chimaeras and duplicates are removed, and finally Hi-C contact matrices are generated by binning at various resolutions and matrix balancing. In this paper we present data with stringent cutoff of MAPQ >30. Hi-C matrices used in this paper were matrix-balanced using Juicer’s built-in Knight-Ruiz (KR) algorithm. Matrices were visualized using Juicebox( Robinson et al., 2018 58. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Turner, D. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... Juicebox.js provides a cloud-based visualization system for Hi-C data Cell Syst. 2018; 6 :256-258.e1 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cumulative interchromosomal contacts at the 100kb resolution were constructed by calling Juicer Tools dump function to extract genome wide normalized data from a.hic file and subsequently analyzed as previously described( Monahan et al., 2019 52. Monahan, K. ∙ Horta, A. ∙ Lomvardas, S. LHX2− and LDB1-mediated trans interactions regulate olfactory receptor choice Nature. 2019; 565 :448-453 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we counted all OR-OR cluster combinations and measured the interchromosomal contacts that map within OR clusters. These counts were then aggregated per genomic bin. The same was done for any genomic contact outside the region of interest to estimate average 'background' contact intensity which was subsequently subtracted from intensity observed within the OR cluster. Obtained value for each cluster was used for visualization on violin plots. Of note, the intensity of random contacts was higher in COVID-19 samples that resulted in negative values on violin plots.
For human OR cluster annotation, we used genes annotated in HORDE database. For the hamster, firstly, we annotated OR genes via alignment of transcripts present in Ensemble against MesAur1.0_HiC.fasta.gz; next, we defined OR cluster as a stretch of OR genes in vicinity of 50 kb not interrupted by another non OR gene. 82 OR clusters were annotated for human, while for the hamster we were able to annotate only 46 clusters due to poor OR gene annotation in hamster genome in general.
A hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to assess the presence of genomic compartments( Rao et al., 2014 56. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4558) PubMed Google Scholar ). As we previously described( Monahan et al., 2019 52. Monahan, K. ∙ Horta, A. ∙ Lomvardas, S. LHX2− and LDB1-mediated trans interactions regulate olfactory receptor choice Nature. 2019; 565 :448-453 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), we extracted subset of normalized interchromosomal contacts to construct 500 kb contact matrix in a manner that 500 kb loci on odd chromosomes emerged as rows while the same size loci on even chromosomes appeared on the columns. We tested 2-21 components to construct HMMs for odd vs even chromosomes; we found that 9 components reveal the existence of trans OR cluster specific compartments. A score was calculated using hmmlearn to deduce the likelihood of the given number of compartments. The same was done for the transposed even vs odd chromosome matrix. The mean value for given compartment was used for graphical visualization.
Statistical tests were performed in R using base packages for statistical analysis and ggplot2 for visualization. For all data, a p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical details for each experiment including statistical tests applied and number of replicates can be found in the figure legends and methods details, p-value s are indicated on figures.
