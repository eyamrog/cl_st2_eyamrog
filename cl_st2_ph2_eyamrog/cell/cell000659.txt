Title: The hemolysin A secretion system is a multi-engine pump containing three ABC transporters


Abstract: Summary

Type 1 secretion systems (T1SSs) are widespread in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, extruding protein substrates following synthesis of the entire polypeptide. The Escherichia coli hemolysin A secretion system has long been considered a prototype in structural and mechanistic studies of T1SSs. Three membrane proteins—an inner membrane ABC transporter HlyB, an adaptor protein HlyD, and an outer membrane porin TolC—are required for secretion. However, the stoichiometry and structure of the complex are unknown. Here, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures determined in two conformations reveal that the inner membrane complex is a hetero-dodecameric assembly comprising three HlyB homodimers and six HlyD subunits. Functional studies indicate that oligomerization of HlyB and HlyD is essential for protein secretion and that polypeptides translocate through a canonical ABC transporter pathway in HlyB. Our data suggest that T1SSs entail three ABC transporters, one that functions as a protein channel and two that allosterically power the translocation process.

Section: Introduction

Type 1 secretion systems (T1SS)s are simple yet highly efficient protein translocation systems in Gram-negative bacteria, capable of secreting substrates ranging from 20 to 1,500 kDa ( Binet et al., 1997 7.

Acta. 2014; 1843 :1629-1641 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the substrates are often much larger than the transporter, the standard alternating access mechanism of transport ( Jardetzky, 1966 17. Jardetzky, O. Simple allosteric model for membrane pumps Nature. 1966; 211 :969-970 Crossref Scopus (950) PubMed Google Scholar ) is unlikely to be applicable. Furthermore, the secretion signal is encoded in the C-terminal sequence of the substrate ( Ghigo and Wandersman, 1994 13. Ghigo, J.M. ∙ Wandersman, C. A carboxyl-terminal four-amino acid motif is required for secretion of the metalloprotease PrtG through the Erwinia chrysanthemi protease secretion pathway J. Biol.

Isolation and analysis of the C-terminal signal directing export of Escherichia coli hemolysin protein across both bacterial membranes EMBO J. 1989; 8 :595-605 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ), meaning that secretion takes place after the polypeptide is fully synthesized. Therefore, the mechanism of T1SS must be distinct from that of the well-characterized Sec translocon ( Rapoport et al., 2017 41. Rapoport, T.A. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Park, E. Structural and mechanistic insights into protein translocation Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33 :369-390 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The Escherichia coli hemolysin A (HlyA) transport system has long been used as a model to study T1SSs ( Holland et al., 2005 16. Holland, I.B. ∙ Schmitt, L. ∙ Young, J. Type 1 protein secretion in bacteria, the ABC-transporter dependent pathway (review) Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22 :29-39 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thomas et al., 2014 50.

The substrate, HlyA, is a 110-kDa toxin, named after its ability to lyse red blood cells ( Noegel et al., 1979 35. Noegel, A. ∙ Rdest, U. ∙ Springer, W. ... Plasmid cistrons controlling synthesis and excretion of the exotoxin alpha-haemolysin of Escherichia coli Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175 :343-350 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). HlyA is secreted in an unfolded state from the cytosol to the extracellular space ( Koronakis et al., 1989 24. Koronakis, V. ∙ Koronakis, E. ∙ Hughes, C. Isolation and analysis of the C-terminal signal directing export of Escherichia coli hemolysin protein across both bacterial membranes EMBO J. 1989; 8 :595-605 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thomas et al., 2014 50.

Acta. 2014; 1843 :1629-1641 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ), where extracellular Ca 2+ induces its folding ( Ostolaza et al., 1995 36. Ostolaza, H. ∙ Soloaga, A. ∙ Goñi, F.M. The binding of divalent cations to Escherichia coli alpha-haemolysin Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228 :39-44 PubMed Google Scholar ; Sánchez-Magraner et al., 2007 43.

The calcium-binding C-terminal domain of Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin is a major determinant in the surface-active properties of the protein J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :11827-11835 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). The transport system comprises two specific inner membrane proteins, HlyB and HlyD, as well as the ubiquitous outer membrane protein TolC ( Figure 1 A) ( Wandersman and Delepelaire, 1990 51. Wandersman, C. ∙ Delepelaire, P. TolC, an Escherichia coli outer membrane protein required for hemolysin secretion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87 :4776-4780 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ).
HlyB belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters; molecular pumps powered by ATP hydrolysis ( Higgins, 1992 15. Higgins, C.F. ABC transporters: from microorganisms to man Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8 :67-113 Crossref Scopus (3530) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutations in HlyB that abolish ATP hydrolysis also prevent HlyA secretion, demonstrating the ATP-dependence of protein export ( Koronakis et al., 1995 23. Koronakis, E. ∙ Hughes, C. ∙ Milisav, I. ... Protein exporter function and in vitro ATPase activity are correlated in ABC-domain mutants of HlyB Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16 :87-96 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like all ABC transporters, HlyB contains two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). In addition, HlyB and most other inner membrane T1SSs contain an N-terminal C39-like domain (CLD)—a region with homology to C39 cysteine proteases but without the catalytic cysteine residue and therefore enzymatic activity ( Lecher et al., 2012 26. Lecher, J. ∙ Schwarz, C.K.W. ∙ Stoldt, M. ... An RTX transporter tethers its unfolded substrate during secretion via a unique N-terminal domain Structure. 2012; 20 :1778-1787 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
HlyD is a periplasmic adaptor protein unique to Gram-negative bacteria. It contains a small N-terminal cytosolic domain, a single transmembrane (TM) helix, and a large periplasmic domain that interacts with TolC ( Balakrishnan et al., 2001 4. Balakrishnan, L. ∙ Hughes, C. ∙ Koronakis, V. Substrate-triggered recruitment of the TolC channel-tunnel during type I export of hemolysin by Escherichia coli J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313 :501-510 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2012 27. Lee, M. ∙ Jun, S.-Y. ∙ Yoon, B.-Y. ... Membrane fusion proteins of type I secretion system and tripartite efflux pumps share a binding motif for TolC in gram-negative bacteria PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e40460 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pimenta et al., 1999 38. Pimenta, A.L. ∙ Young, J. ∙ Holland, I.B. ... Antibody analysis of the localisation, expression and stability of HlyD, the MFP component of the E. coli haemolysin translocator Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261 :122-132 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ). Proteins homologous to HlyD are also found in tripartite drug efflux systems, where they form a critical link between the inner membrane transporter and the outer membrane porin ( Jo et al., 2019 18. Jo, I. ∙ Kim, J.S. ∙ Xu, Y. ... Recent paradigm shift in the assembly of bacterial tripartite efflux pumps and the type I secretion system J. Microbiol. 2019; 57 :185-194 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ).
Although HlyB and HlyD are dedicated to HlyA secretion, TolC is a multifunctional porin involved in many transport systems, including tripartite drug efflux systems. Elegant in vivo cross-linking experiments have shown that substrate induces dynamic assembly of the HlyA secretion apparatus ( Thanabalu et al., 1998 49. Thanabalu, T. ∙ Koronakis, E. ∙ Hughes, C. ... Substrate-induced assembly of a contiguous channel for protein export from E.coli: reversible bridging of an inner-membrane translocase to an outer membrane exit pore EMBO J. 1998; 17 :6487-6496 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). A constitutive complex of HlyB and HlyD remains anchored in the inner membrane ( Figure 1 A). Upon substrate binding, likely to the cytoplasmic region of HlyD and the CLD of HlyB ( Balakrishnan et al., 2001 4. Balakrishnan, L. ∙ Hughes, C. ∙ Koronakis, V. Substrate-triggered recruitment of the TolC channel-tunnel during type I export of hemolysin by Escherichia coli J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313 :501-510 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lecher et al., 2012 26. Lecher, J. ∙ Schwarz, C.K.W. ∙ Stoldt, M. ... An RTX transporter tethers its unfolded substrate during secretion via a unique N-terminal domain Structure. 2012; 20 :1778-1787 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), TolC is engaged and a transient “protein tunnel” is formed between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space.
Although structural information is available for TolC and the soluble domains of HlyB and HlyD ( Bavro et al., 2008 5. Bavro, V.N. ∙ Pietras, Z. ∙ Furnham, N. ...

Biol. 2003; 330 :333-342 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ), the stoichiometry and structure of the complex, and therefore the pathway and mechanism for polypeptide transport, remain unknown. In this study, we used single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of the constitutive inner membrane HlyB/D complex in the absence and presence of ATP at 2.9 and 3.4 Å resolution, respectively. These structures reveal a hetero-dodecameric assembly of three HlyB homodimers and six HlyD monomers in an architecture distinct from any other ABC transporter system. Functional assays further indicated that oligomerization is essential for HlyA secretion and that polypeptides are translocated through the canonical substrate translocation pathway of a single HlyB dimer rather than the central pore of the complex. The distinct structure of the HlyB/D complex compared with that of the tripartite multidrug efflux system indicates that different mechanisms are deployed to secrete small molecules versus large protein substrates across the bacterial envelope.

Section: Results

Previous work has shown that isolated HlyB forms a homodimer ( Figure 1 B) ( Kanonenberg et al., 2019 19. Kanonenberg, K. ∙ Smits, S.H.J. ∙ Schmitt, L. Functional reconstitution of HlyB, a type I secretion ABC transporter, in saposin-A nanoparticles Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8436 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ); however, co-expression of HlyB with HlyD resulted in a large oligomeric assembly ( Figure 1 B). We determined the structure of this complex, solubilized using digitonin, by cryo-EM at 2.9 Å resolution ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 ; Video S1 ; Table S1 ). The structure reveals a large oligomer consisting of six copies of HlyD and six copies of HlyB. The cytosolic and TM regions have well-defined density, permitting de novo model building ( Figure S1 ). In contrast, the periplasmic region of HlyD is largely invisible ( Figure S2 ), suggesting that this region is flexible in the absence of substrate and TolC. The final model, consisting of 42 TM helices, three CLDs, six NBDs, six HlyD cytosolic domains, and two β-barrel domains (poly-alanine), was refined to good statistics and excellent stereochemistry ( Table S1 ).

Architecture of the hemolysin inner membrane complex, related to Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4
The inner membrane complex is a trimer of three protomers, each consisting of a HlyB homodimer and two HlyD subunits ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Viewed from the periplasm, the trimeric center is formed by the TMDs of HlyB and lipid molecules ( Figure S3 ). All six HlyD subunits reside at the peripheral of the trimer and link together adjacent HlyB dimers. A view from the cytosol shows that the three protomers form contacts via their NBDs. Interestingly, in all three protomers, only one of the two HlyB CLDs is structured ( Figure 2 , CLD1/3/5), positioned between neighboring protomers. The other CLD is not resolved, likely folded but flexible.
The conformation of each protomer is similar but not identical ( Figure 2 ; Video S1 ). In protomer A, the HlyB dimer exhibits an “inward-facing” conformation ( Figure 2 B, left) in which its two TMDs surround a vestibule that opens laterally to the cytosol. The two NBDs are separated at the TMD/NBD interface, making contact only at their periplasmic ends. In contrast, the HlyB dimers in protomers B and C both exhibit an occluded conformation in which the TM cavity is closed off at both sides of the membrane ( Figure 2 B, middle and right). Despite the absence of nucleotides, the two NBDs are in close contact with each other. It is likely that the ATP-free, NBD dimer is stabilized by the lateral interactions with neighboring protomers.
Full-length HlyD contains 478 residues that form an N-terminal cytosolic region, a single TM helix, and a large periplasmic region ( Figures 3 A and S2 ). In our structure of the HlyB/D complex, each HlyD subunit within a protomer is located at opposite sides of the HlyB dimer and adopts a different conformation. One subunit (for example HlyD1 in protomer A) is structured from residues 29–77, whereas the other (HlyD2) is structured from residues 9–77. The TM helix in each HlyD subunit is well defined and packs against a HlyB subunit ( Figure 3 ). The amphipathic helix (residues 9–24) in HlyD2 lies nearly parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane, forming hydrophobic contacts with the elbow helix of HlyB2 ( Figure 3 , right).
The structure of the periplasmic residues 96–360 was previously determined by X-ray crystallography, revealing a small lipoyl domain flexibly connected to a long α-helical domain ( Kim et al., 2016 22. Kim, J.-S. ∙ Song, S. ∙ Lee, M. ... Crystal structure of a soluble fragment of the membrane fusion protein HlyD in a type I secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria Structure. 2016; 24 :477-485 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our EM map at a lower contour shows densities that may correspond to the lipoyl domains ( Figure S2 ). However, the α-helical domain, onto which the TolC-binding site is mapped, is not visible. Stabilization of this domain upon TolC engagement would extend the complex into the periplasm by 150 Å ( Figure S2 ). The very C-terminal region of HlyD (residues 355–471) folds into a β-barrel domain and a short helix at the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane ( Figures 3 and S2 ).
The most intriguing feature of the HlyB/D complex is the trimeric assembly of the protomers. We therefore analyzed whether residues mediating oligomeric assembly are conserved. Within the membrane, protomers make few direct interactions with each other ( Figures 1 D and S3 ; Video S1 ). Instead, well-ordered lipid molecules at the interfaces mediate nonpolar interactions between TM helices. The main interface between adjacent protomers resides in the cytoplasm, where residues 35–50 of HlyD form two short helices whose acidic residues project onto a positively charged surface on the CLD of HlyB ( Figure 4 A). Three of these five acidic residues (E35, D37, and E38) are within the “cytosolic charge cluster,” previously identified as an essential and highly conserved motif for secretion ( Balakrishnan et al., 2001 4. Balakrishnan, L. ∙ Hughes, C. ∙ Koronakis, V. Substrate-triggered recruitment of the TolC channel-tunnel during type I export of hemolysin by Escherichia coli J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313 :501-510 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the surface of the CLD, five basic residues form a network of electrostatic interactions with the acidic residues on HlyD ( Figure 4 A). Despite the asymmetry observed within the complex, the three CLD/HlyD interfaces between adjacent protomers are identical. Furthermore, sequence alignment ( Figure S4 ) shows that these residues are strictly conserved among transporters containing CLDs but not among ABC transporters containing an active peptidase domain such as PCAT1 ( Madeira et al., 2022 30. Madeira, F. ∙ Pearce, M. ∙ Tivey, A.R.N. ... Search and sequence analysis tools services from EMBL-EBI in 2022 Nucleic Acids Res. 2022; 50 :W276-W279 Crossref Scopus (1093) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it seems that the electrostatic interface between HlyD and CLD has been selectively maintained during evolution.
To test if the HlyD-CLD interface is necessary for substrate secretion, we coexpressed the HlyA secretion system in E. coli and measured the functional consequences of mutating conserved residues within the electrostatic network ( Figure 4 B). In cells expressing wild-type (WT) HlyB and HlyD, we observed significant export of a truncated HlyA construct containing the secretion signal (HlyAc, residues 807–1,024) into the culture supernatant ( Bakkes et al., 2010 3. Bakkes, P.J. ∙ Jenewein, S. ∙ Smits, S.H.J. ... The rate of folding dictates substrate secretion by the Escherichia coli hemolysin type 1 secretion system J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 :40573-40580 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nicaud et al., 1986 34. Nicaud, J.M. ∙ Mackman, N. ∙ Gray, L. ... The C-terminal, 23-kDa peptide of E. coli haemolysin 2001 contains all the information necessary for its secretion by the haemolysin (Hly) export machinery FEBS Lett. 1986; 204 :331-335 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single amino acid substitutions in HlyB and HlyD that we predicted would interrupt the HlyD-CLD interface had little functional impact on substrate translocation. However, combining two or three of these mutations diminished or completely abolished HlyAc secretion into the extracellular medium in five of six cases. None of the variants appeared to influence intracellular levels of HlyAc, HlyB, and HlyD. Given the extent of the electrostatic network at the HlyD-CLD interface, it is not surprising that multiple mutations are necessary to disrupt the structural integrity of the oligomer.
Next, to determine whether HlyAc secretion was compromised in these mutants by defective oligomeric assembly, we purified four mutant combinations and analyzed their oligomerization state by size-exclusion chromatography ( Figure 4 C). The results showed a clear correlation between function and oligomerization. The E40A/E47A HlyD variant, whose secretion of HlyAc is similar to that of WT ( Figure 4 B), eluted from the size-exclusion column at the same position as the WT protein, indicating intact oligomerization ( Figure 4 C, orange trace). In contrast, all three functionally defective mutants migrated much slower than WT on the size-exclusion column, at positions consistent with individual HlyB/D protomers and isolated HlyB dimers ( Figure 4 C). These data indicate that formation of the trimeric assembly is essential for substrate secretion.
Finally, to test if the HlyD-CLD interaction is relevant in cells, we introduced two pairs of cysteines at the inter-protomer interface into an otherwise cysteine-less HlyB/D and expressed these constructs in E. coli ( Figure 4 D). Substitutions were chosen at positions proximal to the conserved electrostatic residues at the HlyD-CLD interface ( Figure 4 D, left). Variants containing these mutations were competent in HlyAc secretion. For both cysteine pairs, a higher molecular weight band corresponding to both HlyB and HlyD was observed, which was enhanced by treating intact cells with the oxidation catalyst diamide and abolished by a reducing agent. Together, these data provide evidence that oligomerization occurs in the native environment and is essential for secretion of HlyA.
The asymmetric structure of HlyB dimers within the trimeric complex raises the question of whether all three HlyB dimers bind to and hydrolyze ATP. To address this question, we compared the ATP hydrolysis rate of the HlyB/D complex with that of the isolated HlyB dimer ( Figure 5 A). Isolated HlyB dimers, either in detergent or nanodiscs, had a maximum ATP turnover rate of 2 per s. and a Hill coefficient of approximately 2, indicating co-operativity between the two NBDs during ATP hydrolysis. In comparison, HlyB/D complexes hydrolyzed ATP at a maximum rate of 6 per s, exactly three times that of isolated HlyB dimers. The substrate concentration at half-saturation (K 0.5 ) and Hill coefficient were very similar to those of isolated HlyB dimers. These data suggest that all three HlyB dimers in the inner membrane complex can bind and hydrolyze ATP, with no apparent cooperativity between them.
Next, we investigated the structural consequence of ATP binding to the HlyB/D complex. We resolved a 3.4 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of an ATP-bound complex in which the catalytic base residue in HlyB (E631) was replaced with a glutamine to prevent ATP hydrolysis ( Figures 5 and S5 ; Video S2 ). In contrast to the ATP-free structure, the three protomers in the ATP-bound conformation are identical ( Figure 5 B). This is consistent with our ATPase activity data indicating that all three HlyB dimers are able to bind and hydrolyze ATP ( Figure 5 A). The HlyB dimers adopt an occluded, NBD-dimerized conformation with well-resolved densities for ATP molecules at the NBD dimer interface ( Figure 5 C). The TM cavity is small and inaccessible from either side of the membrane. Similar to the ATP-free form, only one of the two CLDs in each protomer is ordered and bridges contacts between adjacent protomers ( Figure 5 D). The structure of each HlyD subunit is very similar to those in the ATP-free structure, except that the TM helix of one subunit (HlyD1/3/5) is more flexible and only partially resolved. No density corresponding to the periplasmic region, including the β-barrel domains, was visible.

Conformational transitions of the hemolysin inner membrane complex in the presence and absence of ATP, related to Figures 1, 2, 3, 5, and S6
The conformational change brought by ATP-binding is small in protomers B and C, where the NBDs are already in contact and the TMDs are in the occluded conformation. In contrast, the HlyB dimer in protomer A undergoes a larger conformational change between the two structures ( Figures 5 D and S6 ; Video S2 ). In the presence of ATP, the intracellular half of the TMDs rotate toward the dimer interface, closing off the lateral opening, and the NBDs move up to 15 Å toward each other to form a closed dimer. The structured CLD domain moves in concert with the TMD and NBD, although maintaining the same electrostatic interactions with the adjacent protomer as the apo form ( Figure 5 E), consistent with mutagenesis data indicating that this interface is essential for toxin secretion ( Figure 4 B).
The HlyB/D complex contains two potential pathways for substrate to cross the inner membrane ( Figure 6 A). One pathway is the central pore at the interface of the three protomers and the other resides within a HlyB dimer at the interface of the two TMDs. The central pore is hydrophobic and partially filled with lipid molecules, whereas the interior surface of the intra-dimer pathway is lined with polar and charged residues ( Figures 6 A–6C and S3 ).
To discern which pore forms the substrate translocation pathway, we used in vivo site-specific photo-crosslinking ( Chin et al., 2002 9. Chin, J.W. ∙ Martin, A.B. ∙ King, D.S. ... Addition of a photocrosslinking amino acid to the genetic code of Escherichiacoli Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :11020-11024 Crossref Scopus (571) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miyazaki et al., 2020 32. Miyazaki, R. ∙ Akiyama, Y. ∙ Mori, H. A photo-cross-linking approach to monitor protein dynamics in living cells Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen. Subj. 2020; 1864 :129317 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ) to identify residues that come into proximity with the substrate. The coexpressed secretion system was modified by incorporating the photo-reactive amino acid para-benzoyl phenylalanine (pBPA) at various positions in HlyB ( Figure 6 B). The substrate was modified by fusing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to the N terminus of HlyAc. Because HlyA is transported in the unfolded state, adding fast-folding eGFP as a “passenger” stalls translocation ( Lenders et al., 2015 28. Lenders, M.H.H. ∙ Weidtkamp-Peters, S. ∙ Kleinschrodt, D. ... Directionality of substrate translocation of the hemolysin A type I secretion system Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :12470 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thus increases the probability of cross-linking.
We first tested whether the cross-linking strategy could recapitulate the previously identified interactions between HlyA and CLD ( Lecher et al., 2012 26. Lecher, J. ∙ Schwarz, C.K.W. ∙ Stoldt, M. ... An RTX transporter tethers its unfolded substrate during secretion via a unique N-terminal domain Structure. 2012; 20 :1778-1787 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). pBPA was introduced at five different positions in CLD ( Figure 6 D, first panel), and cells co-expressing pBPA-HlyB and eGFP-HlyAc were irradiated with UV and monitored for the appearance of the crosslink product HlyB-eGFP-HlyAc. We observed crosslinks with the substrate at positions 82 and 102, consistent with a prior NMR study showing that HlyA binds to a surface containing both residues ( Lecher et al., 2012 26. Lecher, J. ∙ Schwarz, C.K.W. ∙ Stoldt, M. ... An RTX transporter tethers its unfolded substrate during secretion via a unique N-terminal domain Structure. 2012; 20 :1778-1787 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Next, we tested 16 positions within the TMD of HlyB ( Figure 6 D). Prominent cross-linking products were detected at six positions (256, 263, 319, 323, 327, and 422), all of which lie along the vestibule within the HlyB dimer ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Specifically, residues R256, F323, and A327 are located at the lateral opening observed in protomer A, N263 and L319 are on the surface of the interior vestibule within the lipid bilayer, and A422 is positioned nearly halfway through the bilayer ( Figures 6 B and 6C, purple). Residue L319 is proximal to K322, a residue previously shown to interact with substrate by in vitro chemical cross-linking ( Figure 6 C, blue) ( Reimann et al., 2016 42. Reimann, S. ∙ Poschmann, G. ∙ Kanonenberg, K. ... Interdomain regulation of the ATPase activity of the ABC transporter haemolysin B from Escherichia coli Biochem. J. 2016; 473 :2471-2483 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). In comparison, no crosslinks were detected at sites that are exposed to the lipid bilayer or in the central pore between HlyB/D protomers ( Figure 6 B). These data reveal that substrate is translocated through the HlyB dimer and not through the central pore.

Section: Discussion

The structure of the HlyB/D complex presented in this work addresses the long-standing uncertainty surrounding the compositional stoichiometry of T1SSs. Previously, based on the structures of tripartite multidrug efflux pumps, it has been assumed that the HlyA transport system contains a HlyB dimer and a TolC trimer ( Alav et al., 2021 2. Alav, I. ∙ Kobylka, J. ∙ Kuth, M.S. ... Structure, assembly, and function of tripartite efflux and type 1 secretion systems in Gram-negative bacteria Chem. Rev. 2021; 121 :5479-5596 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 12. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Llabrés, S. ∙ Neuberger, A. ... Structure of the MacAB-TolC ABC-type tripartite multidrug efflux pump Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17070 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jo et al., 2019 18. Jo, I. ∙ Kim, J.S. ∙ Xu, Y. ... Recent paradigm shift in the assembly of bacterial tripartite efflux pumps and the type I secretion system J. Microbiol. 2019; 57 :185-194 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ). The uncertainty was whether three or six copies of HlyD are involved ( Kim et al., 2016 22. Kim, J.-S. ∙ Song, S. ∙ Lee, M. ... Crystal structure of a soluble fragment of the membrane fusion protein HlyD in a type I secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria Structure. 2016; 24 :477-485 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thanabalu et al., 1998 49. Thanabalu, T. ∙ Koronakis, E. ∙ Hughes, C. ... Substrate-induced assembly of a contiguous channel for protein export from E.coli: reversible bridging of an inner-membrane translocase to an outer membrane exit pore EMBO J. 1998; 17 :6487-6496 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thomas et al., 2014 50. Thomas, S. ∙ Holland, I.B. ∙ Schmitt, L. The type 1 secretion pathway—the hemolysin system and beyond Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843 :1629-1641 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the structure of the HlyB/D complex presented in this study is surprising; it shows that three HlyB dimers and six HlyD subunits co-assemble into a complex with pseudo-trimeric symmetry. This unexpected architecture of the inner membrane complex provides a solution for the anticipated symmetric mismatch between the HlyB homodimer and the TolC homotrimer ( Figure 7 ). Our mutagenesis data demonstrate that oligomerization is essential for HlyA secretion. Moreover, because residues at the inter-protomer interface are highly conserved, we conclude that the hetero-dodecamer complex is a general feature of T1SSs.
Using in vivo photo-crosslinking, we further showed that the translocation pathway lies within a HlyB dimer rather than the central pore. Thus, despite its large size, HlyA is secreted through the canonical substrate translocation pathway of ABC transporters. In the ATP-free WT structure, only one of the HlyB dimers is poised to recruit substrate, with its translocation pathway open to the cytosol and wide enough for an unfolded polypeptide chain to enter. Nevertheless, our ATPase activity analysis and E631Q mutant structure both demonstrate that all three HlyB dimers are capable of binding to and hydrolyzing ATP. It is therefore tempting to hypothesize that during HlyA secretion, substrate is recruited into the translocation pathway of one protomer, whereas the other two protomers hydrolyze ATP to power the translocation allosterically. Future experiments will be carried out to test this model.
Prior to our work, the function of the CLDs was perplexing, as they are essential for substrate recruitment but have no catalytic activity ( Lecher et al., 2012 26. Lecher, J. ∙ Schwarz, C.K.W. ∙ Stoldt, M. ... An RTX transporter tethers its unfolded substrate during secretion via a unique N-terminal domain Structure. 2012; 20 :1778-1787 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural comparison of HlyB and PCAT1, a polypeptide-secretion transporter with an active C39 protease domain ( Kieuvongngam et al., 2020 21. Kieuvongngam, V. ∙ Olinares, P.D.B. ∙ Palillo, A. ... Structural basis of substrate recognition by a polypeptide processing and secretion transporter eLife. 2020; 9 :e51492 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2015 29. Lin, D.Y. ∙ Huang, S. ∙ Chen, J. Crystal structures of a polypeptide processing and secretion transporter Nature. 2015; 523 :425-430 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), shows that their N-terminal domains have similar structure but are located at completely different positions relative to the transporter core ( Figure S7 ). In PCAT1, the two peptidase domains dock symmetrically onto the lateral openings of the TM cavity, positioned to deliver the peptide cargo into the translocation pathway ( Kieuvongngam et al., 2020 21. Kieuvongngam, V. ∙ Olinares, P.D.B. ∙ Palillo, A. ... Structural basis of substrate recognition by a polypeptide processing and secretion transporter eLife. 2020; 9 :e51492 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2015 29. Lin, D.Y. ∙ Huang, S. ∙ Chen, J. Crystal structures of a polypeptide processing and secretion transporter Nature. 2015; 523 :425-430 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 A). In HlyB, only one of the two CLDs is ordered and is positioned at the protomer interface, distal to the translocation pathway ( Figure S7 A). It is possible that the two CLDs have two different functions: the interfacial CLD promoting oligomerization and the flexible CLD recruiting substrate akin to the peptidase domain of PCAT1. Intriguingly, the cytoplasmic regions of HlyD have dual functions in both oligomerization and substrate recruiting ( Balakrishnan et al., 2001 4. Balakrishnan, L. ∙ Hughes, C. ∙ Koronakis, V. Substrate-triggered recruitment of the TolC channel-tunnel during type I export of hemolysin by Escherichia coli J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313 :501-510 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Previous studies of PrtD, a T1SS ABC transporter without an N-terminal peptidase-like domain, revealed that TM helices 3 and 6 were highly kinked ( Morgan et al., 2017 33. Morgan, J.L.W. ∙ Acheson, J.F. ∙ Zimmer, J. Structure of a type-1 secretion system ABC transporter Structure. 2017; 25 :522-529 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed this feature in HlyB, but only in the occluded conformation ( Figure S7 B). TM3 and TM6 are continuous and without sharp kinks in the inward-facing HlyB structure ( Figure S7 B). In the occluded conformation, TM3 and TM6 are nearly superimposable with those of PrtD, each of which contains a sharp kink that bends the helices inward. Consequently, the TM cavity is much narrower in occluded HlyB compared with that of the inward-facing structure ( Figure S7 B). These observations support previous hypotheses that kinked TM helices are signatures of protein-conducting ABC transporters ( Morgan et al., 2017 33. Morgan, J.L.W. ∙ Acheson, J.F. ∙ Zimmer, J. Structure of a type-1 secretion system ABC transporter Structure. 2017; 25 :522-529 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the presence of both kinked and continuous helices in the HlyB/D complex suggests that conformational changes of TM3 and TM6 are likely to play a key role in substrate translocation.
Collectively, our data support the concept of a large T1SS assembly comprising three active ABC transporters and six HlyD subunits. Because genes encoding HlyB and HlyD are co-transcribed within a single operon, it is likely that this inner membrane complex forms co-translationally ( Figure 7 ). Within the complex, the periplasmic domains of HlyD are flexibly tethered and the TM pathways closed at the periplasmic surface. Binding of HlyA triggers large conformational changes, likely involving assembly of the HlyD periplasmic regions into an elongated structure that resembles those in the drug efflux pump adaptor protein MacA ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 12. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Llabrés, S. ∙ Neuberger, A. ... Structure of the MacAB-TolC ABC-type tripartite multidrug efflux pump Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17070 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such a hexameric HlyD structure would conveniently interact with TolC, a trimeric channel that penetrates the periplasm and the outer membrane ( Wandersman and Delepelaire, 1990 51. Wandersman, C. ∙ Delepelaire, P. TolC, an Escherichia coli outer membrane protein required for hemolysin secretion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87 :4776-4780 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the periplasmic surface of all six HlyB subunits are enveloped by six HlyD subunits, polypeptides emerging from any one of the HlyB dimers could be channeled through HlyD and subsequently to the extracellular space through TolC.
Our study describes structural and functional studies of the HlyA secretion system. These data challenge our previous model, which was conceived by analogy to tripartite efflux systems. Using in vivo translocation and disulfide cross-linking assays, we have presented evidence that the oligomeric assembly of HlyB/D occurs in vivo and is essential for protein secretion. However, these structures were determined in detergent micelles rather than native membrane bilayers. Furthermore, due to the transient nature of the interactions between TolC and the inner membrane complex, the structure of the full protein-tunnel remains elusive. Nevertheless, the intriguing architecture of the HlyB/D complex that we have revealed here will no doubt inspire new experiments to uncover the molecular mechanism of the HlyA transport system as well as that of other T1SSs.

The E. coli B strain C43(DE3) (Lucigen) was used for all biochemical experiments and the E. coli K-12 strain XL2-Blue (Agilent) was used for cloning and mutagenesis. Cells were grown in LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 ug/mL) as necessary.
Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1 . The codon-optimized gene fragments encoding HlyB (UniprotKB: Q8FDZ8) and HlyD (UniProtKB: A0A0H2VCZ1) from uropathogenic E. coli ( UPEC/strain CFT073/ATCC 700928 ) were synthesized (Genewiz) and individually subcloned into a pQlink vector containing an IPTG inducible promoter ( Scheich et al., 2007 45. Scheich, C. ∙ Kümmel, D. ∙ Soumailakakis, D. ... Vectors for co-expression of an unrestricted number of proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :e43 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). A Strep and 6xHis tag were attached to the C-terminus of HlyB and N-terminus of HlyD, respectively. For complex co-expression, each plasmid containing an individual gene were combined by the reported ligation-independent approach ( Scheich et al., 2007 45. Scheich, C. ∙ Kümmel, D. ∙ Soumailakakis, D. ... Vectors for co-expression of an unrestricted number of proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :e43 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plasmids expressing HlyB or HlyD variants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis.
SDS-PAGE analyses were performed at 180V for 60 to 75 min using precast 4-20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gradient gels (ThermoFisher). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto ImmunoBlot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) for 15 min at a constant voltage of 25 V. Membranes were blocked with casein blocking buffer for 1 hour and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. Membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-T buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20) and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to an Alexa Fluor 680 dye for 1 hr at 4°C. Finally, the membranes were again washed 3 times and the fluorescence signal was visualized by a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (BioRad). All antibodies were used at a 1:2000 dilution.
E. coli strain C43 cells were transformed with plasmids expressing HlyB-Strep and His-HlyD, grown to an OD 600 of 0.6-0.8 at 37°C, and induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at 18°C overnight. The cell pellet was collected by centrifugation (4000 x g, 20 min), resuspended in buffer A (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 15% glycerol), and lysed by three passes through a high-pressure homogenizer at 15,000 psi (Emulsiflex-C3; Avestin). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min and the supernatant was subjected to a second round of ultracentrifugation (45,000 rpm, Beckman type 45 Ti rotor) for 1 hour to pellet the cell membrane. After being dispersed with a hand-held homogenizer in buffer A, the membrane fraction was solubilized with buffer A plus 1% digitonin (Sigma) for 1 hour at 4°C. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 60,000 x g for 40 min. To purify isolated HlyB, the supernatant was applied to a Strep-Tactin (IBA) affinity column two times. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% digitonin) and the protein was eluted with buffer B plus 5 mM d-desthiobiotin (Sigma). To purify the HlyB/D complex, the supernatant was first purified using Strep-Tactin resin and the eluate was subsequently loaded onto a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column. Ni-NTA resin was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer B plus 30 mM imidazole and the protein was eluted with buffer B plus 200 mM imidazole. The eluate was then concentrated (100 kD cut-off centrifuge concentrator, Millipore) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) with buffer B. The major peak fraction was directly used for cryo-EM grid preparation or ATPase activity assay. Variants of HlyB or HlyD were purified in similar conditions as the WT protein.
An aliquot of 3 μl purified HlyB/D complex (∼0.2 mg/ml) was applied to glow-discharged 400-mesh Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 400 Au grids coated with a homemade continuous thin carbon layer. For the E631Q HlyB/D complex, protein was incubated with 2mM ATP-Mg for 30 min before freezing grids. After ∼20 sec waiting time, the grids were blotted for 2 sec and plunged into the liquid ethane using an FEI Mark IV Vitrobot operated at 10°C and 100% humidity. For the WT HlyB/D complex, the grids were screened on Talos Arctica (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electron microscope and 11,055 movie stacks were collected on a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electron microscope at the New York Structural Biology Center using Leginon. The images were recorded with a K2 Summit camera (Gatan) in both counting mode (3143 movies) and super-resolution mode (7912 movies) at a nominal magnification of 22,500× (calibrated pixel size of 1.07 Å on the specimen level) and a defocus range from −1.0 to −3.0 μm. Exposures of 10 s were dose-fractionated into 40 frames, with a dose rate of 8 electrons·pixel −1 ·s −1 (∼1.75 electrons·Å −2 per frame), resulting in a total dose of 70 electrons·Å −2 . For the ATP-bound E631Q HlyB/D complex, 12,489 movie stacks were collected on a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electron microscope in the Cryo-EM Resource Center at the Rockefeller University using SerialEM. The images were also recorded with a K2 Summit camera (Gatan) at a nominal magnification of 22,500× (calibrated pixel size of 1.30 Å on the specimen level) in super-resolution mode and a defocus range from −1.0 to −3.0 μm. Exposures of 10 s were dose-fractionated into 40 frames, with a dose rate of 10 electrons·pixel −1 ·s −1 (∼1.48 electrons·Å −2 per frame), resulting in a total dose of 60 electrons·Å −2 .
For the WT HlyB/D complex dataset, raw movie stacks were first subjected to beam-induced motion correction using the program MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 53. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters for each micrograph were estimated using Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 52. Zhang, K. Gctf: real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ). About 1,000 images were selected and particles were picked using Gautomatch ( www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang ) without templates. After 2D classification in Relion 3 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 54. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ), the resulting 2D class averages representing projections in different orientations were imported to Gautomatch as templates for automatic particle picking of all images. The picked particles were subjected to two rounds of 2D classification in Relion 3, and then imported to cryoSPARC for Ab initio 3D reconstruction to generate an initial model ( Punjani et al., 2017 39. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ). The selected 1,034,537 particles were then subjected to global angular search 3D classification in Relion 3 with one class and step size of 7.5°. The particles were further subjected to local angular search 3D classification with 5 classes and step of 3.75°. The classes that showed clear secondary structure features were selected and 361,688 particles were subjected to local search 3D auto-refinement, which resulted in a 3.4 Å map. Subsequent CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing using Relion 3 improved the resolution to 3.1 Å. To improve the density of periplasmic region, we performed a further 3D classification and refinement. A soft mask covering the periplasmic and the outer leaflet portion of HlyB were applied to the reconstruction. Signal outside the mask were subtracted and the modified particles were subjected to 3D classification (k=6, T=10) without alignment. Classes (136,123 particles) with clear densities for the β-barrel domains were selected and the original particles were imported to cryoSPARC3 for non-uniform (NU) refinement ( Punjani et al., 2020 40. Punjani, A. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Fleet, D.J. Non-uniform refinement: adaptive regularization improves single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :1214-1221 Crossref Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ), which resulted in a map of ∼2.9 Å resolution. No symmetry was imposed during WT HlyB/D data processing.
For the ATP-bound E631Q HlyB/D complex, all steps before 3D classification were the same as for the WT HlyB/D dataset. After 2D classification and Ab-initio reconstruction, 369,804 particles were subjected to a global angular search 3D classification (no symmetry imposed) with one class and 25 iterations. The outputs were subjected to local angular search 3D classification with 3 classes. The best class was selected (168,036 particles) and refined to 4.3 Å resolution (no symmetry imposed) or 4.1 Å resolution (C3 symmetry imposed). To improve the resolution, a further 3D classification was performed (k=3, T=4) without particle alignment. The class with the highest resolution was selected (55,516 particles) for 3D auto-refinement to improved resolution at 3.8 Å. Finally, after iterative CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, the particles were imported to cryoSPARC3 for non-uniform (NU) refinement with C3 symmetry imposed, resulting in a map at 3.4 Å resolution. All resolutions were estimated using the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion. Masking and B-factor sharpening were automatically determined during NU refinement. Local resolution estimations were also performed in cryoSPARC.
The transmembrane regions of HlyB/D complex, the N-terminal cytoplasmic region, and the C-terminal tail (455-471) of HlyD were built de novo in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 11. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reported structures of HlyB NBD and CLD (PDB codes: 2fgk and 3zua) were fitted into the cryo-EM maps using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 37. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera—a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33478) PubMed Google Scholar ) and manually adjusted in Coot. A homology model of the β-barrel domain of HlyD was generated by SWISS-MODEL ( Biasini et al., 2014 6. Biasini, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ∙ Waterhouse, A. ... SWISS-MODEL: modelling protein tertiary and quaternary structure using evolutionary information Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W252-W258 Crossref Scopus (3933) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the structures of homologous proteins (PDB codes: 3fpp, 4tko, 5xu0) and then docked into the cryo-EM map using Chimera. Phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) were modelled into the lipid-like densities. Structure refinement was performed using phenix.real_space_refine application with secondary structure and geometry restraints ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1519) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural model validations were carried out using Phenix and MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 8. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural figures were prepared using Pymol ( http://www.pymol.org ), Chimera, and ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 14. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2595) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Membrane-scaffold protein 1 (MSP1) with a N-terminal 6xHis tag was expressed in E.coli C43(DE3).The cells were lysed in buffer A (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 15% glycerol). The cell lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column. The resin was washed with 30 column volumes of TBS buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) plus 30 mM imidazole and the protein was eluted with TBS buffer plus 200 mM imidazole. The protein was further purified using a Superdex200 column equilibrated with 30 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl. The MSP1-containing fractions were concentrated to ∼6 mg/ml and stored at -80°C.
HlyB used for nanodisc reconstruction was purified in GDN (Anatrace). Specifically, the membrane fraction was solubilized in buffer A plus 1.5% GDN. After loading on Strep-Tactin column, the resin was washed with buffer C (30 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.01% GDN) and the protein was eluted with buffer C containing 5mM d-desthiobiotin. The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column) in buffer D (30 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.005% GDN). The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼2mg/ml. The protein was incorporated into nanodiscs using a 1:1.2:140 molar ratio of protein: membrane-scaffold protein 1 (MSP1): total E. coli lipid extract (Avanti). E.coli total lipid extract (Avanti) was solubilized in 30 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 14 mM DDM and 150 mM NaCl by water bath sonication prior to nanodisc reconstitution. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, then freshly prepared bio-beads SM2 (BioRad) were added to remove the detergent and initiate the reconstitution. After incubation for 16 hr at 4°C, bio-beads were removed by centrifugation and the reconstituted protein was further purified on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated with buffer E (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl). Peak fractions were collected and used for the ATPase assay.
The ATPase activity was measured using an ATP regeneration-NADH consumption coupled system ( Scharschmidt et al., 1979 44. Scharschmidt, B.F. ∙ Keeffe, E.B. ∙ Blankenship, N.M. ... Validation of a recording spectrophotometric method for measurement of membrane-associated Mg- and NaK-ATPase activity J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1979; 93 :790-799 PubMed Google Scholar ). Pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), NADH, and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) were purchased from Roche. The reaction was carried out in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.06% digitonin, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl 2 ) containing 60 μg/ml of PK, 32 μg/ml LDH, 4 mM PEP, and 0.15 mM NADH. HlyB (purified in digitonin or reconstituted in nanodiscs) and the HlyB/D complex (WT or E631Q mutant) were diluted to 30 nM in reaction buffer (digitonin was excluded from the reaction buffer for the nanodisc samples). Different concentrations of ATP were added to initiate the reaction and NADH fluorescence depletion was recorded continuously for 45 min by an Infinite M1000 Microplate Reader (TECAN) with excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission wavelength of 445 nm. To quantify the ATP hydrolysis rate, mean values and standard deviation from three independent measurements were calculated. Data and kinetic parameters were analyzed in GraphPad Prism8 using both the Hill equation and the Michaelis-Menten model. The ATP turnover rates were calculated assuming a molecular weight of 160 kDa for HlyB and 810 kDa for HlyB/D complex.
DNA encoding the C-terminal fragment of HlyA (HlyAc, UniprotKB: A0A0H2VC10, amino acids 807-1024) was subcloned into pQlink vector with an N-terminal 8xHis tag and then assembled with pQlink-HlyBStrep-HisHlyD using a similar approach as described above. The generated pQlink-HisHlyA-HlyBStrep-HisHlyD was used as a template for the subsequent mutagenesis on HlyB and HlyD. All WT and mutant plasmids were transformed into E. coli C43 (DE3) strain and plated on LB-agar plates. Single colonies were picked and inoculated into 50 ml Luria broth (LB) medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When cells were grown to OD 600 of ∼0.8, the expression of HlyA, HlyB and HlyD were induced with 1 mM IPTG and an additional 2 mM CaCl 2 was added to the medium. After induction at 37°C for ∼2 h, cells were harvested at OD 600 of 1.5. To purify secreted HlyAc, the medium was incubated with 100 μl Ni-NTA resin for 1h at 4°C. After extensive washing with buffer A (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 15% glycerol), protein was eluted with buffer A plus 250 mM imidazole and subjected to SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis. To compare the relative expression level of HlyA, HlyB and HlyD, the cell pellets were lysed in buffer A. A small aliquot of the lysate was for subsequent detection of unsecreted HlyA; the rest was solubilized with 1% DDM (Anatrace) and then divided in two equal parts. One part was incubated with Strep-Tactin resin to purify HlyB and the other on Ni-NTA resin to purify HlyD for immunoblot analysis.
HlyB and HlyD constructs containing a cysteine substitution each were subcloned into the pQlink vector and transformed into E. coli strain C43(DE3) cells. 100 mL of cells were grown to an OD600 between 0.6 - 0.8 and expression was induced with the addition of 0.1 mM IPTG after turning the temperature down to 18C. After overnight induction, each culture was split in half, with one half supplemented with 1 mM diamide (Sigma) to promote oxidation for 10 min at room temperature. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation (4,000g 10 min, 4°C) and either immediately used for protein purification or frozen for storage. For protein purification, the cell pellets were resuspended in 3 mL of PBS and lysed by sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000g, 30 min, 4°C) and supernatant was subjected to a second round of ultracentrifugation (100,000g, 1 hr, 4°C) to isolate cell membranes. The membrane pellet was solubilized in PBS supplemented with 1% digitonin for 1 hour at 4°C. The insoluble fraction was removed by another round of centrifugation (60,000g, 40 min, 4°C). The supernatant was then incubated with Strep-Tactin (IBA) affinity resin for 30 min at 4°C. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS containing 0.06% digitonin and eluted with PBS containing 0.06% digitonin and 5 mM d-desthiobiotin (Sigma). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis.
To generate translocation intermediates, the gene fragment encoding eGFP was subcloned into pQlink-HisHlyA-HlyBStrep-HIsHlyD using Gibson assembly method (NEB). The generated pQlink-eGFPHlyA-HlyBStrep-HlyD was used as a template for the subsequent mutagenesis of HlyB. All plasmids were transformed into E. coli C43 (DE3) cells and plated on LB-agar plate supplemented with 100 ug/mL ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Single colonies were picked and inoculated into 100 ml LB medium supplemented with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and 0.8 mM pBPA (Bachem). When cells were grown to an OD 600 between 0.6 – 0.8, the temperature was turned down to 18°C. Expression of HlyA, HlyB, and HlyD were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG while the expression of the pBPA, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were induced with 0.2% (w/v) arabinose. After overnight induction, each culture was split in half, with one half used directly for irradiation with UV light at 365 for 10 min on ice using a UVP Blak-Ray B-100AP high-intensity UV lamp with a 100-W spot bulb. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation (4,000g, 10 min, 4°C) and either immediately used for protein purification or frozen for storage. For protein purification, the cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml TBS (20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl), supplemented with 1% (w/v) Anzergent 3-14 (Anatrace). Cells were lysed by sonication and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant was then incubated with Strep-Tactin (IBA) affinity resin for 1 hr at 4°C. After removal of unbound proteins, the resin was washed with 50 column volumes of TBS containing 0.02% Anzergent 3-14. Samples were eluted twice with 5 column volumes of 0.02% Anzergent 3-14 and 5 mM d-deshtiobiotin (Sigma) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and GFP in-gel fluorescence using a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (BioRad).
The quantification and statistical analyses are integral parts of the software and algorithms used. Details are described in the main text and STAR Methods sections.
