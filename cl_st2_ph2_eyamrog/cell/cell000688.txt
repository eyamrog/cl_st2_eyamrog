Title: Structural basis for Cas9 off-target activity


Abstract: Summary

The target DNA specificity of the CRISPR-associated genome editor nuclease Cas9 is determined by complementarity to a 20-nucleotide segment in its guide RNA. However, Cas9 can bind and cleave partially complementary off-target sequences, which raises safety concerns for its use in clinical applications. Here, we report crystallographic structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target substrates, revealing that off-target binding is enabled by a range of noncanonical base-pairing interactions within the guide:off-target heteroduplex. Off-target substrates containing single-nucleotide deletions relative to the guide RNA are accommodated by base skipping or multiple noncanonical base pairs rather than RNA bulge formation. Finally, PAM-distal mismatches result in duplex unpairing and induce a conformational change in the Cas9 REC lobe that perturbs its conformational activation. Together, these insights provide a structural rationale for the off-target activity of Cas9 and contribute to the improved rational design of guide RNAs and off-target prediction algorithms.

Section: Introduction

Cas9, the effector nuclease of prokaryotic type II CRISPR adaptive immune systems ( Makarova et al., 2020 53. Makarova, K.S. ∙ Wolf, Y.I. ∙ Iranzo, J. ... Evolutionary classification of CRISPR-Cas systems: a burst of class 2 and derived variants Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18 :67-83 Crossref Scopus (1370) PubMed Google Scholar ), cleaves double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrates complementary to a guide CRISPR RNA (crRNA) ( Jinek et al., 2012 35. Jinek, M. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Fonfara, I. ... A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity Science. 2012; 337 :816-821 Crossref Scopus (11706) PubMed Google Scholar ). By changing the sequence of the guide RNA (gRNA), the target DNA specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system is readily programmable ( Jinek et al., 2012 35. Jinek, M. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Fonfara, I. ... A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity Science. 2012; 337 :816-821 Crossref Scopus (11706) PubMed Google Scholar ), a feature that has been widely exploited for genome engineering applications ( Anzalone et al., 2020 5. Anzalone, A.V. ∙ Koblan, L.W. ∙ Liu, D.R. Genome editing with CRISPR-Cas nucleases, base editors, transposases and prime editors Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :824-844 Crossref Scopus (1253) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cas9 functions in conjunction with a trans -activating crRNA (tracrRNA), which is required both for crRNA loading and subsequent DNA binding and cleavage ( Deltcheva et al., 2011 19. Deltcheva, E. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Sharma, C.M. ...

Target DNA binding and cleavage are further dependent on the presence of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target sequence ( Anders et al., 2014 4. Anders, C. ∙ Niewoehner, O. ∙ Duerst, A. ... Structural basis of PAM-dependent target DNA recognition by the Cas9 endonuclease Nature. 2014; 513 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (962) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jinek et al., 2012 35.

Due to its high activity and 5′-NGG-3′ PAM specificity, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) remains the most widely used CRISPR-Cas nuclease for gene editing applications. However, despite a high intrinsic accuracy in generating targeted DNA breaks, SpCas9 can nevertheless cleave genomic DNA sequences with imperfect complementarity to the gRNA, resulting in off-target editing ( Cameron et al., 2017 12.

GUIDE-seq enables genome-wide profiling of off-target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas nucleases Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :187-197 Crossref Scopus (1577) PubMed Google Scholar ). The off-target activity of SpCas9, as well as other Cas9 enzymes, thus presents a safety concern for their therapeutic applications.
Off-target sites typically contain one or several nucleobase mismatches relative to the gRNA ( Cameron et al., 2017 12. Cameron, P. ∙ Fuller, C.K. ∙ Donohoue, P.D. ...

Recent studies have established that the type of mismatch, its positioning, and the total number of mismatches are important determinants of off-target DNA binding and cleavage ( Boyle et al., 2017 9.

PAM-proximal mismatches within the seed region of the gRNA-target strand (TS) DNA heteroduplex typically have a dramatic impact on substrate DNA binding and R-loop formation ( Boyle et al., 2021 10.

In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches are compatible with stable binding; however, their presence often results in the formation of a catalytically incompetent complex ( Boyle et al., 2021 10.

Moreover, Cas9 has been shown to cleave off-target substrates containing insertions or deletions relative to the gRNA sequence, which have been proposed to be recognized through the formation of nucleotide “bulges” in the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex ( Boyle et al., 2021 10.

Numerous computational tools have been developed to predict possible genomic off-target sites based on sequence similarity ( Bae et al., 2014 6. Bae, S. ∙ Park, J. ∙ Kim, J.S. Cas-OFFinder: a fast and versatile algorithm that searches for potential off-target sites of Cas9 RNA-guided endonucleases Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1473-1475 Crossref Scopus (1440) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stemmer et al., 2015 75.

CCTop: an intuitive, flexible and reliable CRISPR/Cas9 target prediction tool PLoS One. 2015; 10 :e0124633 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the majority of actual off-target cleavage events remain unpredicted ( Cameron et al., 2017 12. Cameron, P. ∙ Fuller, C.K. ∙ Donohoue, P.D. ... Mapping the genomic landscape of CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :600-606 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tsai et al., 2015 80. Tsai, S.Q. ∙ Zheng, Z. ∙ Nguyen, N.T. ... GUIDE-seq enables genome-wide profiling of off-target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas nucleases Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :187-197 Crossref Scopus (1577) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, although Cas9 is able to bind genomic sites harboring as few as five complementary nucleotides, only a relatively small number of off-target sites are actually cleaved and result in detectable off-target editing in cells ( Kuscu et al., 2014 45. Kuscu, C. ∙ Arslan, S. ∙ Singh, R. ... Genome-wide analysis reveals characteristics of off-target sites bound by the Cas9 endonuclease Nat.

Several structures of target-bound Cas9 complexes have been determined to date ( Anders et al., 2014 4. Anders, C. ∙ Niewoehner, O. ∙ Duerst, A. ...

Biol. 2019; 26 :679-685 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) that have shed light on the mechanism of on-target binding and cleavage. However, the same processes for off-target sites remain poorly understood.
To elucidate the mechanism of mismatch tolerance of Cas9, we determined crystal structures of a comprehensive set of bona fide off-target-bound complexes. These structures reveal that the formation of noncanonical base pairs and preservation of heteroduplex shape underpin the off-target tolerance of Cas9. We also observe that multiple consecutive mismatches can be accommodated by base skipping of a gRNA nucleotide, as opposed to nucleotide bulging. Finally, the structure of an off-target complex containing three PAM-distal mismatches exhibits REC2/3 domain rearrangements, which likely perturbs conformational activation of Cas9 and thus modulates cleavage efficiency. Taken together, our structural data reveal the diversity of mechanisms enabling off-target recognition and lay the foundation for improved off-target prediction and engineering optimized CRISPR-Cas9 complex designs for gene editing.

Section: Results

Multiple studies have investigated the off-target activity of Cas9, suggesting context-dependent tolerance of nucleobase mismatches between the gRNA and off-target DNA sequences ( Boyle et al., 2021 10.

Systematic in vitro profiling of off-target affinity, cleavage and efficiency for CRISPR enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5037-5053 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate the effect of mismatches on Cas9 binding and cleavage, we performed the SITE-Seq assay ( Cameron et al., 2017 12. Cameron, P. ∙ Fuller, C.K. ∙ Donohoue, P.D. ... Mapping the genomic landscape of CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :600-606 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ) to define the off-target landscapes of 12 well-studied gRNAs to select suitable off-targets for further evaluation ( Figures S1 A and S1B; Table S1 ). The SITE-Seq assay analysis revealed a total of 3,848 detectable off-target sites at the highest Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) concentration, with a median of 5 mismatches per off-target site ( Figure S1 C). The detected mismatches covered all possible base mismatch combinations and were distributed throughout the length of the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex ( Figures S1 D, S1E, S1G, and S1H).
To probe the thermodynamics of on- and off-target substrate DNA binding and the kinetics of DNA cleavage, we focused on a subset of four gRNAs ( AAVS1 , FANCF , PTPRC-tgt2 , and TRAC ) and a total of 15 bona fide off-target sites detectable in vivo ( Cameron et al., 2017 12.

Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :187-197 Crossref Scopus (1577) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A) that covered all 12 possible base mispair types. In vitro nuclease activity assays revealed that all selected off-target sequences were cleaved slower than the corresponding on-target substrates, with 20- to 500-fold reductions in the observed rate constants ( Table 1 ; Figure S2 A). To distinguish whether the cleavage defects were due to slow R-loop formation or perturbations in downstream steps, we also quantified cleavage kinetics using partially single-stranded PAM-presenting (PAMmer) DNA substrates ( Anders et al., 2014 4. Anders, C. ∙ Niewoehner, O. ∙ Duerst, A. ...

These experiments revealed that the slower cleavage kinetics of most off-target substrates was due to perturbed R-loop formation ( Table 1 ; Figure S2 B). However, for some off-targets, notably AAVS1 off-targets #2 and #5, FANCF off-targets #3, #4, and #6, and PTPRC-tgt2 off-target #1, the rate of PAMmer substrate cleavage was more than 100-fold slower compared with their respective on-target sequences ( Table 1 ; Figure S2 B), indicating perturbations in the conformational activation checkpoint downstream of guide-target hybridization or inhibition of cleavage by direct steric hindrance of the Cas9 HNH domain ( Chen et al., 2017 14.

Complementary quantification of substrate DNA binding using DNA nanolever (switchSENSE) methodology revealed perturbations in the binding affinities of most off-targets ( Table 1 ; Data S1 ). Notably, the reductions in binding affinities were almost entirely due to increased dissociation rates (k off ), while on-binding rates (k on ) were largely unperturbed ( Table 1 ), indicating that most of the tested off-targets promote DNA dissociation, likely due to R-loop collapse. However, there was little correlation between the observed reductions in cleavage rates and binding constants ( Figure S2 C), confirming that the molecular basis for off-target discrimination by Cas9 is not based on substrate binding alone, in agreement with prior studies ( Boyle et al., 2021 10.

Systematic in vitro profiling of off-target affinity, cleavage and efficiency for CRISPR enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5037-5053 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The dissociation rate (k off ) correlated significantly only with the number of mismatches located in the seed region (R 2 = 0.46, p = 0.001) ( Figure S2 C), suggesting that seed mismatches promote R-loop collapse and non-target strand (NTS) rehybridization ( Boyle et al., 2017 9.

DNA interrogation by the CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 Nature. 2014; 507 :62-67 Crossref Scopus (1399) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Furthermore, we compared the measured cleavage rate constants (k obs ) with predicted data from a leading biophysical model of Cas9 off-target cleavage that accounts for mismatch number and position but utilizes position-independent weights for mismatch type ( Jones et al., 2021 36. Jones, Jr., S.K. ∙ Hawkins, J.A. ∙ Johnson, N.V. ... Massively parallel kinetic profiling of natural and engineered CRISPR nucleases Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :84-93 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite good overall correlation between the model and our data (R 2 = 0.46, p = 0.004) ( Figure S2 C), there were several prominent outliers ( AAVS1 off-target #2 and off-target #3 and FANCF off-target #4), suggesting that accurate modeling of off-target interactions requires accounting for position-specific effects of individual mismatch types ( Figure S2 D).
Finally, to benchmark the editing efficiency of the selected off-target substrates in vivo , we transfected human primary T cells with recombinant Cas9 RNPs at multiple concentrations and quantified indel frequencies. We observed efficient cellular editing at the on-target site for each gRNA at all RNP concentrations and detected editing at 7 of the 15 off-target sites in our set, including the deletion-containing FANCF off-target #3 ( Figures S2 E and S2F; Table S2 ), which contained a mismatch-reverting single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) relative to the reference human genome sequence.
To obtain insights into the structural basis of off-target recognition and mismatch tolerance, we employed a previously described approach ( Anders et al., 2014 4. Anders, C. ∙ Niewoehner, O. ∙ Duerst, A. ... Structural basis of PAM-dependent target DNA recognition by the Cas9 endonuclease Nature. 2014; 513 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (962) PubMed Google Scholar ) to co-crystallize Cas9 with single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and partially duplexed off-target DNA substrates ( Figure 1 C). Focusing on our set of AAVS1 , FANCF , PTPRC-tgt2 , and TRAC off-targets ( Figure 1 A), covering all 12 possible mismatch types, we determined a total of 15 off-target complex structures at resolutions of 2.25–3.30 Å ( Figure 1 C; Table S3 ). Overall, the off-target complex structures have very similar conformations, with the Cas9 polypeptide backbone superimposing with a mean root-mean-square deviation of 0.41 Å over 1,330 Cα atoms (as referenced to the FANCF on-target complex structure, excluding FANCF off-target #4, as discussed below). Of note, the AAVS1 on-target complex structure reveals substantial repositioning of the REC2 domain, which undergoes a 12° rotation (relative to FANCF and TRAC on-target complexes) ( Figure S3 A; Video S1 ), with concomitant shortening of the α-helix comprising residues 301–305 and restructuring of the loop comprising residues 175–179, enabled by the absence of crystal contacts involving the REC2 and REC3 domains.

Morph of REC2 domain between AAVS1 on-target and FANCF on-target structures, related to Figure S3
However, the structures display considerable local variation of the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex conformation ( Table S4 ). Base pairing and base stacking are mostly preserved throughout the heteroduplexes ( Table S4 ), with the exception of positions 1–3 within the PAM-distal end of the guide-TS duplex, where the presence of mismatches results in duplex unpairing ( Figures S3 B–S3E). Interestingly, such unpairing results in the base stacking of the 5'-terminal residue of the sgRNA on top of the unpaired DNA base, as observed in a recent cryo-EM structure of a PAM-distal mismatch off-target complex ( Bravo et al., 2022 11. Bravo, J.P.K. ∙ Liu, M.S. ∙ Hibshman, G.N. ... Structural basis for mismatch surveillance by CRISPR-Cas9 Nature. 2022; 603 :343-347 Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar ). Despite the observed conformational variation, the off-target structures preserve almost all intermolecular contacts between the Cas9 protein and the bound nucleic acids ( Figure S3 F), further underscoring the structural plasticity of Cas9 in accommodating mismatch-induced heteroduplex distortions.
A substantial fraction of the base mismatches observed in the determined off-target complex structures (34 of 49) is accommodated by noncanonical base-pairing interactions that preserve at least one hydrogen bond between the mispaired bases.

Kimsey, I.J. ∙ Petzold, K. ∙ Sathyamoorthy, B. ... Visualizing transient Watson-Crick-like mispairs in DNA and RNA duplexes Nature. 2015; 519 :315-320 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, all rG-dT mismatches in the determined structures are accommodated by wobble base pairing. Observed at duplex positions 4, 13, and 15, the dT base undergoes an ∼1 Å shear displacement into the major groove of the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex to form the wobble base pair ( Figures S4 A–S4E), whereas at duplex position 2, wobble base pairing is enabled by a minor-groove displacement of the rG base ( Figures S4 F–S4G). In contrast, rU-dG base pairs in the determined structures exhibit considerable structural variation. At duplex position 10, the rU base is able to undergo the major groove displacement required for wobble base pairing ( Figure 2 A and S4 H). In contrast, at duplex position 5, the backbone of the RNA strand makes extensive contacts with Cas9 ( Figures S3 and S4 I–S4K), and as a result, the rU-dG base pairs are instead accommodated by compensatory shifts of the dG base to maintain hydrogen-bonding interactions ( Figures S4 I–S4K). At duplex position 9 in the TRAC off-target #1 complex, the rU-dG mismatch is accommodated by wobble base pairing enabled by a minor-groove displacement of the dG base ( Figure S4 L). At the same duplex position in the AAVS1 off-target #1 and #2 complexes, however, this mismatch occurs next to rC-dA and rC-dT mismatches, respectively, and adopts the sterically prohibited Watson-Crick geometry ( Figures S4 M and S4N), implying a tautomeric shift or base deprotonation to accommodate this otherwise unfavorable base-pairing mode ( Figure S4 O). Collectively, these observations suggest that the ability of rU-dG (and likely rG-dT) mismatches to form wobble base-pairing interactions is determined not only by backbone constraints at the specific position within the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex ( Figure S3 F) but also by local sequence context and/or the presence of neighboring mismatches ( Figures S4 C–S4G).
rA-dC or rC-dA mismatches can also form wobble-like base pairs when the adenine base is protonated at the N1 position ( Garg and Heinemann, 2018 26. Garg, A. ∙ Heinemann, U. A novel form of RNA double helix based on G.U and C.A + wobble base pairing RNA. 2018; 24 :209-218 Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2011 84. Wang, W. ∙ Hellinga, H.W. ∙ Beese, L.S. Structural evidence for the rare tautomer hypothesis of spontaneous mutagenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :17644-17648 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the rA-dC mispair found at duplex position 4, the dC base undergoes a wobble displacement compatible with the formation of two hydrogen bonds with the adenine base, indicative of adenine protonation ( Figures 2 B and S4 P). At other duplex positions in our dataset, the rA-dC or rC-dA mispairs are instead accommodated by slight displacements of the adenine base within the base pair plane resulting in the formation of a single hydrogen bond in each case ( Figures S4 Q–S4S).
Accommodating purine-purine mismatches by Watson-Crick-like interactions would normally require severe distortion of the guide:off-target duplex to increase its width by more than 2 Å ( Leontis et al., 2002 48. Leontis, N.B. ∙ Stombaugh, J. ∙ Westhof, E. The non-Watson-Crick base pairs and their associated isostericity matrices Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 :3497-3531 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). At positions where the duplex width is constrained by Cas9 interactions ( Figure S3 F), rG-dA and rA-dG mispairs are accommodated by anti -to- syn isomerization of the adenine base to form two hydrogen-bonding interactions via its Hoogsteen base edge. This is observed at duplex position 11 in the AAVS1 off-target #4 complex (rG-dA mispair) ( Figure 2 C) and at position 7 in the AAVS1 off-target #2 complex (rA-dG mispair) ( Figure S4 T). Similarly, the rG-dG mispair at duplex position 13 in the FANCF off-target #5 complex is accommodated by Hoogsteen base pairing as a result by anti -to- syn isomerization of the gRNA base ( Figure 2 D). Overall, the observed Hoogsteen base-pairing interactions are near-isosteric with canonical base pairs and maintain duplex width without excessive backbone distortion ( Table S4 ).
Whereas wobble (G-U/T or A-C) and Hoogsteen (A-G or G-G) base pairs are generally compatible with the canonical A-form geometry of an RNA-DNA duplex, other nucleotide mismatches only form nonisosteric base pairs that require considerable distortion of the (deoxy)ribose-phosphate backbone. The formation of pyrimidine-pyrimidine base pairs is expected to occur by a substantial reduction in duplex width ( Leontis et al., 2002 48. Leontis, N.B. ∙ Stombaugh, J. ∙ Westhof, E. The non-Watson-Crick base pairs and their associated isostericity matrices Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 :3497-3531 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is observed at the rU-dC mismatch at duplex position 9 in the FANCF off-target #1 complex ( Figure 3 A). Here, the gRNA backbone is able to shift toward the target DNA strand, resulting in a reduction of the C1′-C1′ distance to 8.65 Å compared with 10.0 Å in the FANCF on-target complex. This facilitates the formation of two hydrogen-bonding interactions within the rU-dC base pair, which is further enabled by a substantial increase in base propeller twist ( Figure 3 A). In contrast, rC-dT mismatches remain unpaired at duplex positions 6 and 7 in Figures S5 A and S5B or form only a single hydrogen bond at position 8 ( Figure S5 C), likely due to backbone steric constraints at these positions imposed by Cas9 interactions ( Figure S3 F). Backbone steric constraints also likely influence the formation of rU-dT base pairs ( Figure S3 F). At duplex position 7, the mismatch remains unpaired ( Figure S5 D), whereas productive pairing is seen at duplex positions 8 and 9, facilitated by distortions of the gRNA and TS backbone, respectively ( Figures 3 B, S5 E, and S5F). Of note, the FANCF off-target #7 rC-dT mismatch is bridged by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chain of Arg895 inserted into the minor groove of the heteroduplex ( Figure S5 B); however, the interaction is not essential for the tolerance of rC-dT mismatches at this position ( Figure S5 G; Table S5 ).
rC-dC mismatches only form productive hydrogen-bonding interactions if bridged by a water molecule or when one of the cytosine bases is protonated ( Leontis et al., 2002 48. Leontis, N.B. ∙ Stombaugh, J. ∙ Westhof, E. The non-Watson-Crick base pairs and their associated isostericity matrices Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 :3497-3531 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only the former is observed in the determined structures, at duplex position 5 in the AAVS1 off-target #2 complex ( Figure S5 H). In contrast, at duplex positions 8 and 15, the bases remain unpaired while maintaining intrastrand base stacking interactions ( Figures 3 C and S5 I). Similarly, rA-dA mismatches are unable to form productive hydrogen-bonding interactions within the constraints of an A-form duplex ( Leontis et al., 2002 48. Leontis, N.B. ∙ Stombaugh, J. ∙ Westhof, E. The non-Watson-Crick base pairs and their associated isostericity matrices Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 :3497-3531 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, the rA-dA mismatch at duplex position 5, where duplex width is constrained by Cas9 ( Figure S3 F), is accommodated by extrusion of the dA nucleobase out of the base stack into the major groove of the duplex ( Figure 3 D), which is enabled by local distortion of the TS backbone ( Figure S6 A).
To gain further insights into the mechanism of rA-dA mismatch accommodation and extrapolate our structural observations to other heteroduplex positions, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by introducing single rA-dA mismatches at all 20 positions along the heteroduplex in the context of the catalytically active state of Cas9 (PDB: 6O0Y) and compared the resulting trajectories with the corresponding on-target system. In-depth analysis of the rA-dA conformational dynamics was performed by computing the geometrical descriptors defining the base pair complementarity along the heteroduplex ( Figures S6 B–S6G) ( Lavery et al., 2009 46. Lavery, R. ∙ Moakher, M. ∙ Maddocks, J.H. ... Conformational analysis of nucleic acids revisited: curves+ Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :5917-5929 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). These reveal that at all positions, the rA-dA mismatch is primarily accommodated by base extrusion from the duplex, with positions 3, 5,15, 16, 18, 19, and 20 undergoing dA base extrusion and positions 10 and 17 rA base extrusion. Notably, at duplex positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 12, the broad or bimodal distributions of base pair shear and opening parameters are indicative of considerable conformational dynamics, allowing the rA-dA mismatch to be accommodated by either rA or dA base extrusion ( Figure S6 B). Importantly, rA-dA mismatch simulations at positions 5, 18, and 19 showed very good agreement with the determined crystal structures ( PTPRC-tgt2 off-target #1 , FANCF off-target #6 , AAVS1 off-target #2 ), predicting both dA base extrusion and backbone distortions ( Figures S6 A and S6H).
Analysis of our SITE-Seq assay dataset revealed that off-target rA-dA mismatches occur at all positions within the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex ( Figure S6 I), in agreement with MD simulations, as well as previous studies ( Boyle et al., 2017 9.

Systematic in vitro profiling of off-target affinity, cleavage and efficiency for CRISPR enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5037-5053 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that rA-dA mismatches do not encounter steric barriers within Cas9 that would disfavor their presence, which is consistent with the absence of specific contacts with Cas9 along the length of the major groove of the heteroduplex ( Figure S3 F).
The seed sequence of the gRNA (nucleotides 11–20) makes extensive interactions with Cas9, both in the absence and presence of bound DNA ( Anders et al., 2014 4.

Conversely, binding of off-target DNAs containing PAM-proximal mismatches is inhibited and results in accelerated off-target dissociation ( Boyle et al., 2017 9.

Nevertheless, Cas9 does tolerate most base mismatch types within the seed region of the gRNA, leading to detectable off-target DNA cleavage ( Boyle et al., 2021 10.

In particular, the first two PAM-proximal positions display a markedly higher tolerance for mismatches than the rest of the seed region ( Cofsky et al., 2022 16.

The initiation, propagation and dynamics of CRISPR-SpyCas9 R-loop complex Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :350-361 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ); this is supported by our SITE-Seq assay data as the frequency of mismatches at PAM-proximal positions 18–20 is 1.4–2.0F0B4 higher than at seed positions 14–17 ( Figures S1 D and S1E).
Unlike the seed region of the gRNA, the complementary PAM-proximal TS nucleotides are not directly contacted by Cas9 in the precleavage state and are thus under fewer steric constraints ( Figure S3 F), with the exception of duplex position 20 in which the phosphodiester group of the TS nucleotide makes extensive interactions with the phosphate-lock loop of Cas9 ( Anders et al., 2014 4. Anders, C. ∙ Niewoehner, O. ∙ Duerst, A. ... Structural basis of PAM-dependent target DNA recognition by the Cas9 endonuclease Nature. 2014; 513 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (962) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 A). In agreement with this, four of our off-target complex structures reveal that PAM-proximal base mismatches are accommodated solely by structural distortions of the TS backbone ( Figure 4 ), while the conformation of the gRNA backbone and base stacking within the seed region remain unperturbed ( Figures S7 B and S7C). The presence of an rA-dA mismatch in the PAM-proximal position 18 results in the extrusion of the TS nucleobase into the major groove ( Figure 4 A), likely due to steric constraints on duplex width at this position. In contrast, the rA-dA mismatch at duplex position 19 is instead accommodated by a marked distortion in the TS backbone that results in increased duplex width, which preserves base stacking within the duplex in the absence of productive pairing between the adenine bases ( Figures 4 B and S7 B). Similarly, the rA-dG mismatch at position 19 is accommodated by an ∼2 Å displacement of the TS backbone, increasing duplex width. This not only preserves base stacking but also facilitates rA-dG base paring by two hydrogen-bonding interactions via their Watson-Crick edges ( Figures 4 C and S7 C). This off-target complex also contains an rU-dG mismatch at duplex position 20, which does not undergo wobble base pairing as the rU20 nucleotide is extensively contacted by Cas9 ( Figure S3 F) and unable to shift toward the major groove and is instead accommodated by a slight shift in the dG nucleotide ( Figure 4 C). Finally, the rU-dT base mismatch at duplex position 20 in the AAVS1 off-target #4 complex remains unpaired and the dT base lacks ordered electron density ( Figure 4 D). This is likely a result of the dT nucleotide maintaining contact with the phosphate-lock loop of Cas9 ( Figure S7 A), which prevents a reduction in the duplex width and precludes productive base pairing. Overall, these observations indicate that off-target DNAs containing mismatches to the seed sequence of the gRNA can be accommodated by Cas9 due to limited interactions with the TS DNA in the seed-binding region.
A substantial fraction of off-target sites recovered in our SITE-Seq assay analysis (46.4%, when not considering the possibility of nucleotide insertions or deletions) contained six or more mismatched bases to the gRNA ( Figure S1 C; Table S1 ). Such off-target sequences have previously been proposed to be accommodated by bulging out or skipping of nucleotides ( Boyle et al., 2021 10. Boyle, E.A. ∙ Becker, W.R. ∙ Bai, H.B. ...

Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :187-197 Crossref Scopus (1577) PubMed Google Scholar ), which would result in a shift of the nucleotide register to re-establish correct base-pairing downstream of the initially encountered mismatch ( Figure S1 F). The PTPRC-tgt2 off-target #1 and FANCF off-target #3 sites are predicted to contain single-nucleotide deletions at duplex positions 15 and 17, respectively ( Figures 1 A, S1 F, and S1I; Table S1 ). The structures of the corresponding off-target complexes reveal that the single-nucleotide deletions in these off-target substrates are not accommodated by bulging out the unpaired gRNA nucleotide. Instead, the conformations of the gRNAs remain largely unperturbed and the off-target TS DNAs “skip over” the unpaired gRNA bases to resume productive base-pairing downstream ( Figures 5 A and 5B). The seed regions of the gRNAs make extensive interactions with the bridge helix and the REC1 domain, whereas the TS DNA backbones are displaced by almost 3 Å ( Figures S7 D and S7E). The base pair skips are accommodated by considerable buckling and tilting of the base pairs immediately downstream of the skip site ( Table S4 ). An additional consequence of the base-pairing register shift is the formation of noncanonical base pairs between the off-target DNA and the extra 5′-terminal guanine nucleotides present in the gRNA as a consequence of in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase ( Figures S7 F and S7G). This potentially explains the impact of the 5′-guanines on both R-loop stability and in vitro cleavage activity ( Kulcsár et al., 2020 43. Kulcsár, P.I. ∙ Tálas, A. ∙ Tóth, E. ...

Originally, our SITE-Seq assay analysis classified the AAVS1 off-target #2 as a single-nucleotide deletion at duplex position 9 ( Figures 5 C and S1 I; Table S1 ). Unexpectedly, the structure of the AAVS1 off-target #2 complex instead reveals that the off-target substrate is bound in the unshifted register, resulting in the formation of five base mismatches in the PAM-distal half of the gRNA-TS duplex ( Figure 5 D), including a partially paired rC-dC mismatch at position 5, an rA-dG Hoogsteen pair at position 7, a partially paired rC-dT mismatch at position 8, and a tautomeric rU-dG pair at position 9. The backbone conformations of the gRNA and the off-target TS exhibit minimal distortions and are nearly identical with the corresponding on-target heteroduplex ( Figure 5 D). This implies that some mismatch combinations might synergistically result in gRNA and TS backbone geometries that mimic the on-target conformation and result in off-target tolerance. To test this hypothesis, we reverted the rC-dT mismatch at position 8 to the on-target rC-dG pair, thereby reducing the total amount of off-target mismatches from 6 to 5 ( Figure 5 C). The resulting off-target substrate ( AAVS1 off-target #2-rev) exhibited substantially reduced cleavage rates in both dsDNA and PAMmer formats, as well as a significantly increased dissociation rate ( Figure 5 E; Table S5 ). We replicated these results for two other AAVS1 off-target substrates with different mismatch patterns that were initially predicted to contain PAM-distal deletions ( Figures S8 A–S8C; Table S5 ). Together, these results suggest that some bona fide off-target substrates contain multiple consecutive mismatches, and the reversal of one mismatch may affect the structural integrity of the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex and interfere with DNA binding and/or conformational activation of Cas9 despite a reduction in the total number of mismatches.
To further investigate the accommodation of PAM-distal deletions in Cas9 off-target sites, we selected an additional efficiently cleaved off-target substrate ( CD34 off-target #9; Figures S8 D–S8F), containing a dT substitution at position 17 (resulting in an rU-dT mismatch with the CD34 sgRNA) and a predicted single-nucleotide deletion at position 6. Crystal structure of the resulting complex revealed that the rU-dT mismatch involves the syn conformer of the rU17 nucleotide ( Figure S8 G). The deletion at position 6 is accommodated by base skipping, leaving the base of rA6 unpaired within the guide-TS heteroduplex stack ( Figure S8 H), and the register shift results enable the 5′-terminal guanine nucleotide of the gRNA (introduced during in vitro transcription) to base pair with 3′-terminal TS nucleotide ( Figure S8 I). The backbone distortions in the TS are accompanied by compensatory rearrangements of the REC2 and REC3 domains of Cas9 ( Figure S8 J), which preserve all contacts with the heteroduplex ( Figure S3 F).
Collectively, these results indicate that deletion-containing off-target complexes ( Figure S1 I; Table S1 ) are accommodated either by RNA base skipping, as opposed to RNA nucleotide bulging, or by the formation of multiple base mismatches, with the precise mechanism dependent in part on the position of the deletion.
FANCF off-target #4, which contains three PAM-distal mismatches at positions 1–3 and a G-U mismatch at position 10 ( Figure 1 A), is reproducibly the top ranking off-target site for the FANCF gRNA, as detected by SITE-Seq assay analysis at the lowest Cas9 RNP concentrations ( Table S1 ). The off-target substrate exhibits slow cleavage kinetics in vitro with both dsDNA and PAMmer substrates ( Table 1 ; Figures S2 A and S2B), indicating a perturbation of the conformational activation checkpoint of Cas9. The structure of the FANCF off-target #4 complex reveals that the RNA-DNA heteroduplex is unpaired at positions 1–3 as a result of the PAM-distal mismatches, with nucleotides 1–2 of the gRNA and 19–20 of the TS disordered ( Figure 6 A). Furthermore, Cas9 undergoes structural rearrangements of its REC lobe and the HNH domain ( Figure 6 B; Video S2 ), resulting in a root-mean-square displacement of the REC2 and REC3 domains of 3.7 Å (1,315 Cα atoms) relative to the FANCF on-target complex structure. The REC3 domain undergoes a 19-degree rotation ( Figure 6 B), facilitated by extending the helix comprising residues 703–712 through restructuring of loop residues 713–716 ( Figure S9 A), to accommodate the altered gRNA conformation. The REC2 domain rotates 32° away from the REC3 domain ( Figure 6 B). This is accompanied by restructuring of the hinge loop residues 174–180 and disordering of loops 258–264, 284–285, and 307–309. Concomitantly, the HNH domain rotates 11° away from the heteroduplex, compared with the FANCF on-target structure, to accommodate distortion of the TS DNA ( Figure 6 B).

Morph between FANCF off-target #4 and FANCF on-target showing conformational changes in the REC2, REC3, and HNH domains, related to Figure S9
The unpaired 5′ end of the sgRNA is located at the interface between the REC3 and the RuvC domain and maintains interactions with heteroduplex-sensing residues Lys510, Tyr515, and Arg661 of the REC3 domain ( Figures 6 A and S9 B). In contrast to the corresponding on-target complex structure, the unpaired 3′ end of the off-target TS breaks away from the REC3 lobe and instead points toward the REC2 domain, forming unique interactions with Arg895, Asn899, Arg905, Arg919, and His930 in the HNH domain ( Figure S9 C). These interactions ( Figure S9 D) could be responsible for the observed repositioning of the REC lobe and HNH domain, and they may impede the formation of a cleavage-competent complex.
The conformation of the FANCF off-target #4 complex is distinct from the conformations observed in cryo-EM reconstructions of the pre- and post-cleavage states of the Cas9 complex ( Zhu et al., 2019 94. Zhu, X. ∙ Clarke, R. ∙ Puppala, A.K. ... Cryo-EM structures reveal coordinated domain motions that govern DNA cleavage by Cas9 Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :679-685 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S9 E and S9F). Instead, the off-target complex structure most closely resembles that of a high-fidelity variant xCas9 3.7 containing amino acid substitutions that disrupt interactions with the TS DNA ( Guo et al., 2019 28. Guo, M. ∙ Ren, K. ∙ Zhu, Y. ... Structural insights into a high fidelity variant of SpCas9 Cell Res. 2019; 29 :183-192 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the xCas9 3.7 complex adopts a slightly different REC lobe conformation ( Figure S9 G), the PAM-distal duplex also undergoes unpairing at positions 1–3 and displays a comparable degree of structural disorder ( Figure S9 H). These structural observations thus suggest that the presence of multiple mismatches in the PAM-distal region of a gRNA -off-target DNA duplex leads to conformational perturbations in the DNA-bound complex that resemble the structural consequences of specificity-enhancing mutations in high-fidelity Cas9 variants.

Systematic in vitro profiling of off-target affinity, cleavage and efficiency for CRISPR enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5037-5053 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although numerous methods have been devised for computational prediction of genomic off-target sites and their experimental validation, these have reported highly variable mismatch tolerance profiles depending on the screening method and the target sequence. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon is still lacking. In this study, we used the SITE-Seq assay to examine the off-target landscape of 12 well-studied gRNAs, observing a broad variation of cleavage activities associated with individual off-target substrates. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying off-target activity, we determined atomic structures of a representative set of 16 off-target complexes, providing fundamental insights into the structural aspects of off-target recognition.
The principal, and largely unexpected, finding of our structural analysis is that the majority of nucleotide mismatches in bona fide off-target substrates are accommodated by noncanonical base-pairing interactions. These range from simple wobble or Hoogsteen base-pairing interactions to pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairs that rely on (deoxy)ribose-phosphate backbone distortions that reduce duplex width. With the notable exception of rA-dA mismatches, which are accommodated by extrahelical base extrusion, the structural rearrangements associated with base mismatch accommodation largely preserve base stacking, which is the primary determinant of nucleic acid duplex stability ( Yakovchuk et al., 2006 86. Yakovchuk, P. ∙ Protozanova, E. ∙ Frank-Kamenetskii, M.D. Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 :564-574 Crossref Scopus (740) PubMed Google Scholar ). For some off-target sequences, our structures are suggestive of base protonation or tautomerization facilitating hydrogen-bonding interactions in otherwise nonpermissive mismatches, such as rA-dC. These rare base pair forms have been previously observed in both RNA and DNA duplexes and are thought to be important contributors to DNA replication and translation errors ( Kimsey et al., 2015 39. Kimsey, I.J. ∙ Petzold, K. ∙ Sathyamoorthy, B. ... Visualizing transient Watson-Crick-like mispairs in DNA and RNA duplexes Nature. 2015; 519 :315-320 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 40.

Dynamic basis for dG ∗ dT misincorporation via tautomerization and ionization Nature. 2018; 554 :195-201 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies employing complementary structural methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, will help confirm the occurrence of noncanonical base states in off-target complexes.
The mismatch tolerance of Cas9 can be explained primarily by two factors. First, Cas9 does not directly contact the major- or minor-groove edges of the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex base pairs at any of the duplex positions and thus lacks a steric mechanism to enforce Watson-Crick base pairing. This is further underscored by Cas9’s tolerance of base modifications in target DNA, including cytosine 5-hydroxymethylation and, at least at some duplex positions, glucosyl-5-hydroxymethylation ( Vlot et al., 2018 83. Vlot, M. ∙ Houkes, J. ∙ Lochs, S.J.A. ... Bacteriophage DNA glucosylation impairs target DNA binding by type I and II but not by type V CRISPR-Cas effector complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :873-885 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this respect, Cas9 differs from other molecular systems, notably the ribosome and replicative DNA polymerases, which enhance the specificity of base pairing by direct readout of base-pair shape and steric rejection of mismatches ( Kunkel and Bebenek, 2000 44. Kunkel, T.A. ∙ Bebenek, K. DNA replication fidelity Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69 :497-529 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rodnina and Wintermeyer, 2001 69. Rodnina, M.V. ∙ Wintermeyer, W. Fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA selection on the ribosome: kinetic and structural mechanisms Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70 :415-435 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Timsit, 1999 78. Timsit, Y. DNA structure and polymerase fidelity J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293 :835-853 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Second, Cas9 is a multidomain protein that displays considerable conformational plasticity and is therefore able to accommodate local distortions in the guide-TS duplex geometry by compensatory rearrangements of the REC2, REC3, and HNH domains ( Chen et al., 2017 14. Chen, J.S. ∙ Dagdas, Y.S. ∙ Kleinstiver, B.P. ... Enhanced proofreading governs CRISPR-Cas9 targeting accuracy Nature. 2017; 550 :407-410 Crossref Scopus (817) PubMed Google Scholar ; Donohoue et al., 2021 22.

Cell. 2021; 81 3637.e5–3649.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) Google Scholar ). Indeed, in most off-target structures reported in this study, almost all atomic contacts between Cas9 and the guide-TS heteroduplex are preserved. Thus, Cas9 only detects guide-target mismatches by indirect readout of the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex width, except at the PAM-distal end of the heteroduplex where base mismatches result in duplex unpairing, as discussed below. Our observations are consistent with recent MD simulation studies showing that internally positioned mismatches within the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex are readily incorporated within the heteroduplex and have only minor effects on Cas9 interactions ( Mitchell et al., 2020 55. Mitchell, B.P. ∙ Hsu, R.V. ∙ Medrano, M.A. ... Spontaneous embedding of DNA mismatches Within the RNA:DNA hybrid of CRISPR-Cas9 Front. Mol. Biosci. 2020; 7 :39 Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar ). The lack of a steric base pair enforcement mechanism and the resulting off-target promiscuity likely reflects the biological function of Cas9 in CRISPR immunity, enabling targeting of closely related viruses and hindering immune evasion by mutations or covalent base modifications ( Deveau et al., 2008 20. Deveau, H. ∙ Barrangou, R. ∙ Garneau, J.E. ... Phage response to CRISPR-encoded resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus J.

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated phage resistance is not impeded by the DNA modifications of phage T4 PLoS One. 2014; 9 :e98811 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, such conformational plasticity also enables the incorporation of various chemical modifications in the gRNA that are compatible with the A-form geometry of the heteroduplex ( Cromwell et al., 2018 17.

Structure-guided chemical modification of guide RNA enables potent non-viral in vivo genome editing Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :1179-1187 Crossref Scopus (355) PubMed Google Scholar ). These could potentially disfavor the formation of certain noncanonical base pairs or reduce the backbone flexibility of the gRNA, thereby enhancing off-target discrimination. However, the effect of specific gRNA modifications on particular types of mismatches is yet to be closely examined mechanistically ( Donohoue et al., 2021 22. Donohoue, P.D. ∙ Pacesa, M. ∙ Lau, E. ... Conformational control of Cas9 by CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA guides mitigates off-target activity in T cells Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 3637.e5–3649.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) Google Scholar ).
The seed sequence of the Cas9 gRNA (nucleotides 11–20) is the primary determinant of target DNA binding, a consequence of its structural preordering in an A-like conformation by extensive interactions with Cas9 ( Anders et al., 2014 4.

Biol. 2019; 26 :679-685 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data indicate that structural rigidity of the gRNA seed sequence also affects off-target recognition, as base mismatches in the seed region of the heteroduplex can only be accommodated by conformational distortions of TS DNA, which is subject to only a few steric constraints, notably at position 20 due to interactions with the phosphate-lock loop ( Anders et al., 2014 4. Anders, C. ∙ Niewoehner, O. ∙ Duerst, A. ... Structural basis of PAM-dependent target DNA recognition by the Cas9 endonuclease Nature. 2014; 513 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (962) PubMed Google Scholar ). This increases the energetic penalty of base mispairing in the seed region of the heteroduplex and thus contributes to mismatch sensitivity of Cas9 within the seed region. Although structural distortions of TS DNA facilitate binding of off-target substrates containing seed mismatches, they may nevertheless inhibit off-target cleavage by steric hindrance of the HNH domain, thereby further contributing to off-target discrimination. The contrasting structural plasticities of the gRNA and TS DNA strands are manifested in the differential activities of Cas9 against off-targets containing rU-dG and rG-dT mismatches within the seed region ( Boyle et al., 2021 10. Boyle, E.A. ∙ Becker, W.R. ∙ Bai, H.B. ... Quantification of Cas9 binding and cleavage across diverse guide sequences maps landscapes of target engagement Sci.

Systematic in vitro profiling of off-target affinity, cleavage and efficiency for CRISPR enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5037-5053 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas rG-dT mismatches can be readily accommodated by wobble base pairing, seed sequence rigidity is expected to hinder rU-dG wobble base pairing. Combined with a lower energetic penalty associated with rG-dT mismatch binding (binding an off-target with an rG-dT mismatch requires unpairing a dT-dA base pair in the off-target DNA, while rU-dG off-target recognition requires dC-dG unpairing), these effects thus help Cas9 discriminate against rU-dG mismatches in the seed region.

GUIDE-seq enables genome-wide profiling of off-target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas nucleases Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :187-197 Crossref Scopus (1577) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nucleotide “bulging” has been proposed as a mechanism to recognize such off-targets, which would otherwise result in large numbers of consecutive base mismatches. However, as Cas9 encloses the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex in a central channel and makes extensive interactions along the entire length of the gRNA strand, the formation of RNA bulges is precluded by steric clashes, pointing to a different mechanism.
Indeed, our structural analysis provides no evidence for RNA bulging. Instead, the structures of PTPRC-tgt2 off-target #1 and FANCF off-target #3 complexes reveal that off-target sequences predicted to contain single-nucleotide deletions in the seed region of the heteroduplex are recognized by base skipping, resulting in an unpaired gRNA base within the duplex stack, incurring a large energetic penalty. This is enabled by the lack of extensive contacts of Cas9 with the TS, while rigid coordination of the gRNA in the seed region disfavors extrahelical guide RNA bulging. As the seed region of the TS DNA is devoid of Cas9 contacts in the gRNA precleavage state ( Zhu et al., 2019 94. Zhu, X. ∙ Clarke, R. ∙ Puppala, A.K. ... Cryo-EM structures reveal coordinated domain motions that govern DNA cleavage by Cas9 Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :679-685 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), off-targets containing single-nucleotide insertions in the seed region of the heteroduplex are likely to be recognized by DNA nucleotide bulging, likewise incurring a large energetic penalty as unwinding an off-target DNA sequence containing an insertion requires breaking an extra base pair. Moreover, TS DNA distortion might inhibit cleavage by steric hindrance of the HNH domain.
In contrast, off-target sequences containing deletions in the PAM-distal region of the heteroduplex (positions 1–10) can be recognized either by base skipping, as in the case of CD34 off-target #9, or bound in the unshifted register, with multiple base mismatches accommodated by noncanonical base-pairing interactions, as seen for AAVS1 off-target #2, which was previously predicted to contain an RNA bulge or skip ( Cameron et al., 2017 12. Cameron, P. ∙ Fuller, C.K. ∙ Donohoue, P.D. ... Mapping the genomic landscape of CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :600-606 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lazzarotto et al., 2020 47. Lazzarotto, C.R. ∙ Malinin, N.L. ∙ Li, Y. ... CHANGE-seq reveals genetic and epigenetic effects on CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide activity Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1317-1327 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Which of the two mechanisms is used likely depends on the off-target sequence and the position of the deletion, which in turn dictate the number of mismatches between the guide and the off-target sequence in the unshifted register. Off-target accommodation by multiple noncanonical base pairs likely relies on their synergistic effect to mimic the on-target heteroduplex geometry, which enables unperturbed binding, as supported by our observations that mismatch reversal in several off-target substrates reduces their rates of cleavage. Although our structural analysis does not examine off-target substrates containing insertions, we posit that PAM-distal insertions are recognized as multiple mismatches due to steric hindrance of extrahelical bulging. Thus, our structural findings suggest that a substantial fraction of off-target sites predicted to contain insertions or deletions may be bound via multiple mismatches instead ( Boyle et al., 2021 10. Boyle, E.A. ∙ Becker, W.R. ∙ Bai, H.B. ... Quantification of Cas9 binding and cleavage across diverse guide sequences maps landscapes of target engagement Sci.

Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :84-93 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, these observations explain why Cas9 appears to tolerate mismatches better than insertions or deletions and why deletions and insertions within the seed region are particularly deleterious ( Boyle et al., 2021 10. Boyle, E.A. ∙ Becker, W.R. ∙ Bai, H.B. ... Quantification of Cas9 binding and cleavage across diverse guide sequences maps landscapes of target engagement Sci.

Upon substrate DNA hybridization and R-loop formation, Cas9 undergoes conformational activation of its nuclease domains ( Bravo et al., 2022 11. Bravo, J.P.K. ∙ Liu, M.S. ∙ Hibshman, G.N. ...

Cryo-EM structures reveal coordinated domain motions that govern DNA cleavage by Cas9 Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :679-685 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cas9 REC3 domain plays a key role in the process, as it senses the integrity of the PAM-distal region of the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex and allosterically regulates the REC2 and HNH domains, providing a conformational checkpoint that traps Cas9 in a conformationally inactive state in the absence of PAM-distal hybridization ( Chen et al., 2017 14.

Biophys. 2018; 51 :e91 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2019 94. Zhu, X. ∙ Clarke, R. ∙ Puppala, A.K. ... Cryo-EM structures reveal coordinated domain motions that govern DNA cleavage by Cas9 Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :679-685 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structural data confirm that mismatches at the PAM-distal end of the heteroduplex (positions 1–3) result in heteroduplex unpairing, incomplete R-loop formation, and structural repositioning of the REC3 domain ( Figure 6 ), indicating a perturbation of the Cas9 conformational checkpoint. We envision that the observed conformational state mimics the structural effect of 5′-truncated gRNAs, which have been shown to improve targeting specificity ( Fu et al., 2014 25. Fu, Y. ∙ Sander, J.D. ∙ Reyon, D. ... Improving CRISPR-Cas nuclease specificity using truncated guide RNAs Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :279-284 Crossref Scopus (1582) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, similarities with the structure of a high-fidelity Cas9 variant ( Guo et al., 2019 28. Guo, M. ∙ Ren, K. ∙ Zhu, Y. ... Structural insights into a high fidelity variant of SpCas9 Cell Res. 2019; 29 :183-192 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggest a shared underlying mechanism for increased specificity.
Our structural data reveal that Cas9 plays a limited steric role in off-target discrimination insofar as only sensing the integrity and general shape of the guide-target heteroduplex. Off-target activity is thus largely determined by the kinetics and energetics of R-loop formation, that is off-target DNA strand separation and concomitant gRNA-TS DNA hybridization, and subsequent Cas9 conformational activation. We observe on multiple occasions that a given mismatch adopts different conformational arrangements depending on its position along the gRNA-TS DNA heteroduplex, as further supported by MD simulations of rA-dA mismatches. This poses a challenge for ab initio modeling of off-target activity, as biophysical models of off-target binding and cleavage are bound to be of limited accuracy unless they incorporate position-dependent energetic penalties for each base mismatch type and for deletions, as well as position- and base-specific penalties for insertions ( Boyle et al., 2021 10. Boyle, E.A. ∙ Becker, W.R. ∙ Bai, H.B. ... Quantification of Cas9 binding and cleavage across diverse guide sequences maps landscapes of target engagement Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 :eabe5496 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jones et al., 2021 36. Jones, Jr., S.K. ∙ Hawkins, J.A. ∙ Johnson, N.V. ...

Systematic in vitro profiling of off-target affinity, cleavage and efficiency for CRISPR enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5037-5053 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). As illustrated by our study, MD simulations can complement experimental data to provide structural information on specific mismatches at the remaining positions within the heteroduplex. Thus, ongoing structural and computational studies, combined with machine learning approaches, will assist in generating complete models for off-target prediction.
Furthermore, as certain off-target sequences that are incompatible with dsDNA cleavage can undergo NTS nicking ( Fu et al., 2019 24. Fu, B.X.H. ∙ Smith, J.D. ∙ Fuchs, R.T. ...

The initiation, propagation and dynamics of CRISPR-SpyCas9 R-loop complex Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :350-361 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), future bioinformatic models need to be able to predict off-target nicking activity as well. Furthermore, accurate modeling of off-target interactions remains difficult due to context-dependent effects, as documented in previous studies showing that the binding and cleavage defects of consecutive mismatches deviate from additivity ( Boyle et al., 2021 10. Boyle, E.A. ∙ Becker, W.R. ∙ Bai, H.B. ... Quantification of Cas9 binding and cleavage across diverse guide sequences maps landscapes of target engagement Sci.

Zhang, L. ∙ Rube, H.T. ∙ Vakulskas, C.A. ... Systematic in vitro profiling of off-target affinity, cleavage and efficiency for CRISPR enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5037-5053 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, our structural data rationalize this by showing that the conformation of a given base mismatch is highly sensitive to the presence of neighboring mismatches. As seen in the case of AAVS1 off-target #2 complex, multiple mismatched bases can synergistically combine to preserve an on-target-like heteroduplex conformation that passes the REC3 conformational checkpoint, supporting nearly on-target efficiencies of cleavage ( Zhang et al., 2020 93. Zhang, L. ∙ Rube, H.T. ∙ Vakulskas, C.A. ... Systematic in vitro profiling of off-target affinity, cleavage and efficiency for CRISPR enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5037-5053 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is in line with recent cryo-EM structural studies suggesting that indirect readout of heteroduplex conformation is coupled to nuclease activation, while mismatches disrupt this coupling ( Bravo et al., 2022 11. Bravo, J.P.K. ∙ Liu, M.S. ∙ Hibshman, G.N. ... Structural basis for mismatch surveillance by CRISPR-Cas9 Nature. 2022; 603 :343-347 Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar ; Pacesa et al., 2022 63. Pacesa, M. ∙ Loeff, L. ∙ Querques, I. ... R-loop formation and conformational activation mechanisms of Cas9 Nature. 2022; 609 :191-196 Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar ). Critically, reversion of one of the mismatches in this off-target substrate impairs cleavage activity. Similar effects have been described for other DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors, where mismatches modulate transcription factor binding activity by affecting the conformation of the DNA duplex ( Afek et al., 2020 3. Afek, A. ∙ Shi, H. ∙ Rangadurai, A. ... DNA mismatches reveal conformational penalties in protein-DNA recognition Nature. 2020; 587 :291-296 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an analogy with Cas9, these proteins check for correct binding sites through indirect sequence readout by sampling for the correct duplex shape rather than base sequence ( Abe et al., 2015 1.

In conclusion, structural insights presented in this study establish an initial framework for understanding the molecular basis for the off-target activity of Cas9. In conjunction with ongoing computational studies, these findings will help achieve improved energetic parametrization of off-target mismatches and deletions/insertions, thus contributing to the development of more accurate off-target prediction algorithms and more specific gRNA designs. In doing so, these studies will contribute toward increasing the precision of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and the safety of its therapeutic applications.
The structural dataset presented in this study is necessarily restricted in scope. Although all mismatch types are covered, a much larger collection of off-target complex structures would be required to cover all mismatches at all positions to achieve a complete structural overview of the mismatch tolerance underpinning intrinsic off-target activity of Cas9. Although MD simulations can help fill in the gaps in the experimental data, our findings suggest that mismatch accommodation appears to be sequence context dependent, thus limiting their predictive power. Although we provide insights into off-target substrates containing single-nucleotide deletions, it is presently difficult to predict which mechanism occurs at a given heteroduplex position. Moreover, we currently lack structural data for off-target substrates containing insertions, which will be addressed in future studies. Finally, not all structurally characterized off-targets (∼50%) are efficiently cleaved in cells, despite detectable cleavage in vitro , implying that additional factors affect Cas9 off-targeting in the context of eukaryotic genomes. Thus, further work combining structural and computational approaches will be needed to accurately predict the off-target activity of Cas9.

Sequences of DNA oligonucleotides used in this study are summarized in Data S1 . Crystallization substrates were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich without further purification, sgRNA transcription templates and ATTO-532-labelled cleavage substrates were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., with PAGE and HPLC purification, respectively. Partially double-stranded crystallization substrates were prepared by mixing complementary oligonucleotides in a 1:1 molar ratio (as determined by 260 nm absorption), heating to 95 °C for 5 minutes and slow cooling to room-temperature. Cleavage substrates were prepared similarly, except that a 2-fold molar excess of the non-target strand was used.
Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 wild-type and the nuclease-dead mutant (D10A, H840A) proteins were recombinantly expressed for 16 hours at 18 °C in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Novagen) N-terminally fused to a hexahistidine affinity tag, the maltose binding protein (MBP) polypeptide, and the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Cells were resuspended and lysed in 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl, 5 mM imidazole, and supplemented with added protease inhibitors. Clarified lysate was loaded on a 10 ml Ni-NTA Superflow column (QIAGEN), washed with 7 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl, 5 mM imidazole, and eluted with 10 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 200 mM imidazole. Salt concentration was adjusted and protein was loaded on a 10 ml HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and Cas9 was eluted with 17 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 1.5 M KCl, 1 mM DTT, in a 0-32% gradient (peak elution around 500 mM KCl). His 6 -MBP tag was removed by TEV protease cleavage overnight . The untagged Cas9 was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 200 16/600 (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT. Purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. DTT was omitted in the size-exclusion step of the purification when protein was used for switchSENSE measurements.
sgRNAs were transcribed from a double stranded PCR product template amplified from a plasmid in a 5 ml transcription reaction (30 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 25 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM spermidine, 0.01% Triton X-100, 5 mM CTP, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM GTP, 5 mM UTP, 10 mM DTT, 1 μM DNA transcription template, 0.5 units inorganic pyrophosphatase (Thermo Fischer), 250 μg homemade T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 5 hours, and then treated for 30 minutes with 15 units of RQ1 DNAse (Promega). The transcribed sgRNAs were subsequently PAGE purified on an 8% denaturing (7 M urea) polyacrylamide gel, and lastly ethanol precipitated and resuspended in DEPC treated water.
To assemble the Cas9 on-/off-target ternary complexes, the Cas9 protein was first mixed with the sgRNA in a 1:1.5 molar ratio and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Next, the binary complex was diluted to 2 mg/ml with 20 mM HEPES-KOH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl 2 buffer, pre-annealed 100 μM DNA substrate is added in a 1:1.8 molar ratio and the complex was incubated for another 10 minutes at room temperature. For crystallization, 1 μl of the ternary complex (1-2 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of the reservoir solution (0.1 M Tris-acetate pH 8.5, 0.3-0.5 M KSCN, 17-19% PEG3350) and crystals were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method. In some cases, microseeding was be used to improve crystal morphology. Crystals were harvested after 2-3 weeks, cryoprotected in 0.1 M Tris-acetate pH 8.5, 0.4 M KSCN, 30% PEG3350, 15% ethylene glycol, 1 mM MgCl 2 , and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data was measured at beamlines PXI and PXIII of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) and processed using the XDS package ( Kabsch, 2010 38. Kabsch, W. XDS Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12932) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structures were solved by molecular replacement through the Phaser module of the Phenix package ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the PDB ID: 5FQ5 model omitting the RNA-DNA target duplex from the search. Model adjustment and duplex building was completed using COOT software ( Emsley et al., 2010 23. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Atomic model refinement was performed using Phenix.refine ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). Model validation was performed using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 15. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11087) PubMed Google Scholar ). Protein-nucleic acid interactions were analyzed using the PISA web server ( Krissinel and Henrick, 2007 42. Krissinel, E. ∙ Henrick, K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 :774-797 Crossref Scopus (7661) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conformational geometry analysis of the guide-protospacer duplex was performed using the 3DNA 2.0 web server ( Li et al., 2019 50. Li, S. ∙ Olson, W.K. ∙ Lu, X.J. ... Web 3DNA 2.0 for the analysis, visualization, and modeling of 3D nucleic acid structures Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W26-W34 (2019) Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural figures were generated using PyMOL and ChimeraX ( Pettersen et al., 2021 66. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ...

Cleavage reactions were performed at 37 °C in reaction buffer, containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM DTT. First, Cas9 protein was pre-incubated with sgRNA in 1:1.25 ratio for 10 minutes at room temperature. The protein-sgRNA complex was rapidly mixed with the target strand-ATTO-532-labelled dsDNA, to yield final concentrations of 1.67 μM protein-sgRNA complex and 66.67 nM substrate. 7.5 μl aliquots were taken at 1, 2.5, 5, 15, 45, 90, 150 min, and 24 h time points. Cleavage was stopped by addition of 2 μl of 250 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS and 20 μg of Proteinase K. Formamide was added to the reactions to final concentration of 50%, samples were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, and resolved on a 15% denaturing PAGE gel containing 7 M urea and imaged using a Typhoon FLA 9500 gel imager. Depicted error bars correspond to the standard deviation from four independent cleavage reactions. Rate constants (k obs ) were extracted from single exponential fits: [Product] = A ∗ (1-exp(-k obs ∗ t))
Target strand (TS) oligonucleotides containing a 3’ flanking sequence complementary to the ssDNA covalently bound to the chip electrode, and the non-target strands (NTS) ( Data S1 ) were dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The TS:NTS duplexes were pre-annealed and hybridized to the chip anode. Cas9 protein was mixed with sgRNAs at a 1:2 (protein:RNA) molar ratio, and the complex was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in association buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.01% Tween 20. All switchSENSE experiments were performed on a DRX analyzer using CAS-48-1-R1-S chips (Dynamic Biosensors GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). Kinetics experiments were performed at 25 °C in association buffer, with an association time of 5 min, dissociation time of 20 min, and a flow rate of 50 μl/min.
SITE-Seq assay reaction conditions were performed as described previously ( Cameron et al., 2017 12. Cameron, P. ∙ Fuller, C.K. ∙ Donohoue, P.D. ... Mapping the genomic landscape of CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :600-606 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, high molecular weight genomic DNA (gDNA) was purified from human primary T cells using the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cas9 RNPs were assembled as follows. Equal molar amounts of crRNA and tracrRNA were mixed and heated to 95 °C for 2 min then allowed to cool at room temperature for ∼5 min. Three-fold molar excess of the crRNA-tracrRNA guide was incubated with SpCas9 in cleavage reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol) at 37 °C for 10 min. In a 96-well plate format, 10 μg of gDNA was treated with 0.2 pmol (4 nM), 0.8 pmol (16 nM), 3.2 pmol (64 nM), and 12.8 pmol (256 nM) of each RNP in 50 μl total volume in cleavage reaction buffer. Each cleavage reaction was performed in triplicate. Negative control reactions lacking Cas9-gRNA RNP were assembled in parallel. gDNA was treated with RNPs for 4 hours at 37 °C. SITE-Seq assay library preparation and sequencing was performed as described previously and the final library was loaded onto the Illumina NextSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). ∼1-3 million reads were obtained for each sample.
SITE-Seq assay recovered off-targets were filtered for sites that had read-pileups proximal to the expected cut site, a PAM comprising at least one guanine base, fewer than 12 mismatches (reasoning that sites with 12 or more mismatches are likely spurious peaks not resulting from Cas9-induced double-strand breaks), and all sites with 11 mismatches were visually inspected and included in analysis if a putative deletion or insertion would result in a reduction of at least 4 mismatches relative to the spacer sequence.
Predictive classification of SITE-Seq assay recovered off-target sites as pure mismatches, deletions, or insertions was executed using a scoring algorithm which consisted of the following sequential steps: (i) For each off-target, a gap library was generated where a single nucleotide gap was introduced between each nucleotide in the off-target sequence. (ii) The off-target gap library was then aligned to the spacer sequence and each alignment was scored based on the number of matched bases between the spacer and gapped off-target pair. If the gapped off-target with the highest alignment score improved alignment by at least 4 nucleotides relative to the non-gapped spacer–off-target alignment, the off-target sequence was marked as a single-nucleotide deletion and removed from subsequent analysis. (iii) The remaining pool of off-targets were then aligned to a spacer gapped library where a single nucleotide gap was introduced at each positing in the spacer. (iv) The spacer gap library was then aligned to each off-target sequence and each alignment was scored based on the number of matched bases between the off-target and the gapped spacer pair. If the gapped spacer with the highest alignment score improved alignment by at least 4 nucleotides relative to the non-gapped spacer–off-target alignment, the off-target sequence was marked as a single-nucleotide insertion and removed from subsequent analysis. (v) The remaining off-targets for which the spacer–off-target alignment was not improved by single-nucleotide deletions or insertions were annotated as a mismatched off-targets.
Synthetic crRNA and tracrRNA oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) as AltR™ reagents. Ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) were formulated by incubating 480 pmol of each crRNA and tracrRNA and heated to 95 °C for 2 min, then allowed to cool at room temperature for ∼5 min. Annealed guides were mixed with 160 pmol of Cas9 protein (1:3 molar ratio of Cas9 to guide RNA) in RNP assembly buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 5% glycerol) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. RNPswere then serially diluted two-fold by mixing with equal volume of RNP assembly buffer across seven concentrations down to 2.5 pmol of Cas9 and 7.5 pmol of crRNA-tracrRNA. RNPs were kept at 4 °C or on ice until electroporation.
T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the RoboSep-S cell isolation platform (STEMCELL Technologies) with EasySep Human T cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were then activated for 3 days in “Complete media” (Immunocult-XF T cell expansion media (STEMCELL Technologies), CTS Immune Cell serum replacement (Fisher Scientific), 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (Fisher Scientific), and recombinant human Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2, 100 units/ml)) in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Fisher Scientific) at a bead:cell ratio of 1:1. On the third day, beads were removed and cells expanded in Complete media for 24 hours. Cells were then harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended at 10 7 cells/ml in P4 Primary Cell Nucleofector Solution (Lonza). 20 μL of resuspended cells (corresponding to ∼ 200,000 cells) were then combined with 2.5 μL of RNP and electroporated using the Lonza 4D 96-well Nucleofector electroporation system using pulse code CA137. Transfected cells were then recovered in 180 μl/sample of Complete media. After 48 hours, the electroporated T cells were pelleted and gDNA was isolated by adding 50 μl/well QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Epicentre), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 minutes, 65 °C for 6 minutes, and 95 °C for 3 minutes. The isolated gDNA was diluted with 50 μl sterile water to achieve ∼ 2,000 genome equivalents/μl and samples were stored at -20 °C until sequencing analysis.
On- and off-target sites were amplified in a two-step PCR reaction. In brief, 3.75 μl (corresponding to ∼7,500 cells) of lysate was used as a template for PCR amplification with Q5 Hot-Start High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) and unique primer pairs containing an internal locus-specific region and an outer Illumina-compatible adapter sequence. A second PCR reaction targeting the outer-adapter sequence was performed to append unique indices to each amplicon. Sites were sequenced on a MiSeq with 2 × 151 paired-end reads and v2 chemistry, or NextSeq with 2 × 151 paired- end reads and v2 or v2.5 chemistry (Illumina), and aligned to the hg38 genomic assembly. For each site, indels were tallied if they occurred within 3 nucleotides of the putative Cas9 cut site, and editing efficiencies were calculated by subtracting the percentage of indels in untransfected cells from the percentage of indels in RNP-transfected cells. Depth of coverage was ∼5,000–20,000 reads per amplicon, and all samples with <500 reads aligning to the predicted amplicon were discarded. Lower limit of detection (0.1%) was determined by titration of NIST genomic standards and assessment of expected versus measured values (data not shown).
MD simulations were performed using a well-established protocol, previously employed in several computational studies of CRISPR-Cas9 ( Mitchell et al., 2020 55.

Deciphering off-target effects in CRISPR-Cas9 through accelerated molecular dynamics ACS Cent. Sci. 2019; 5 :651-662 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Amber ff14SB force field ( Maier et al., 2015 52. Maier, J.A. ∙ Martinez, C. ∙ Kasavajhala, K. ... ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015; 11 :3696-3713 Crossref Scopus (6930) PubMed Google Scholar ) was adopted, including the ff99bsc1 corrections for DNA ( Ivani et al., 2016 31. Ivani, I. ∙ Dans, P.D. ∙ Noy, A. ... Parmbsc1: a refined force field for DNA simulations Nat.

Refinement of the Cornell et al. nucleic acids force field based on reference quantum chemical calculations of glycosidic torsion profiles J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011; 7 :2886-2902 Crossref Scopus (764) PubMed Google Scholar ). Explicit water molecules were described using the TIP3P model ( Jorgensen et al., 1983 37. Jorgensen, W.L. ∙ Chandrasekhar, J. ∙ Madura, J.D. ... Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79 :926-935 Crossref Scopus (33497) Google Scholar ), while the Li & Merz model was used for Mg 2+ ions ( Li and Merz, 2014 49. Li, P. ∙ Merz, K.M. Taking into account the ion-induced dipole interaction in the nonbonded model of ions J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014; 10 :289-297 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). An integration time step of 2 fs was applied. All bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm. Temperature control (300 K) was performed via Langevin dynamics ( Turq et al., 1977 81. Turq, P. ∙ Lantelme, F. ∙ Friedman, H.L. Brownian dynamics: its application to ionic solutions J. Chem. Phys. 1977; 66 :3039-3044 Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar ), with a collision frequency γ = 1. Pressure control was accomplished by coupling the system to a Berendsen barostat ( Berendsen et al., 1984 8. Berendsen, H.J.C. ∙ Postma, J.P.M. ∙ van Gunsteren, W.F.v. ... Molecular dynamics with coupling to an external bath J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81 :3684-3690 Crossref Scopus (26035) Google Scholar ), at a reference pressure of 1 atm and with a relaxation time of 2 ps. The systems were subjected to energy minimization to relax water molecules and counter ions, keeping the protein, the RNA, DNA and Mg 2+ ions fixed with harmonic position restraints of 300 kcal/mol · Å 2 . Then, the systems were heated up from 0 to 100 K in the canonical ensemble (NVT), by running two simulations of 5 ps each, imposing position restraints of 100 kcal/mol · Å2 on the above-mentioned elements of the system. The temperature was further increased up to 200 K in ∼100 ps of MD in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT), reducing the restraint to 25 kcal/mol · Å 2 . Subsequently, all restraints were released, and the temperature of the systems was raised up to 300 K in a single NPT simulation of 500 ps. After ∼ 1.1 ns of equilibration, ∼10 ns of NPT runs were carried out allowing the density of the systems to stabilize around 1.01 g cm - 3 . Finally, production runs were carried out in the NVT ensemble, collecting ∼500 ns in three replicates for each of the systems. These simulations have been performed using the GPU-empowered version of AMBER 20 ( Case, 2021 13. Case, D.A. ∙ Aktulga, H.M. ∙ Belfon, K. ...

Routine microsecond molecular dynamics simulations with AMBER on GPUs. 2. Explicit solvent particle mesh Ewald J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013; 9 :3878-3888 Crossref Scopus (2422) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of the RNA:DNA conformational dynamics has been done using the CURVES+ code ( Lavery et al., 2009 46. Lavery, R. ∙ Moakher, M. ∙ Maddocks, J.H. ... Conformational analysis of nucleic acids revisited: curves+ Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :5917-5929 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). Molecular simulations were based on three X-ray structures of CRISPR-Cas9: TRAC on-target (PDB: 7OX8), AAVS1 on-target #2 and FANCF on-target, displaying 20 base pair long RNA:TS DNA hybrid and a cleaved NTS. To study the accommodation of rA-dA mismatches at various positions along the heteroduplex, we systematically mutated the base pairs to rA-dA mismatches ( TRAC on-target for positions 1, 11, 15, and 20; FANCF on-target for positions 3-5, 9, and 18; AAVS1 on-target for positions 2, 6-8, 10, 12-14, 16, 17, and 19), using the LEaP tool in the AMBER 20 code ( Lavery et al., 2009 46. Lavery, R. ∙ Moakher, M. ∙ Maddocks, J.H. ... Conformational analysis of nucleic acids revisited: curves+ Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :5917-5929 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, the pre-cleavage state crystal structure of CRISPR-Cas9 with no mismatches (PDB: 4UN3) was also simulated for comparison. The obtained model systems were embedded in explicit waters, and counterions were added to neutralize the total charge at physiological conditions, leading to periodic simulation cells of ∼145 ∗ 115 ∗ 150 Å 3 and a total of ∼220,000 atoms for each system.

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.1.2. for Windows (GraphPad Software). SITE-seq assay data analysis was performed using a custom built pipeline described in the STAR Methods section.
