Title: Circular RNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants


Abstract: Summary

As the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to drive the worldwide pandemic, there is a constant demand for vaccines that offer more effective and broad-spectrum protection. Here, we report a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that elicited potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses by expressing the trimeric RBD of the spike protein, providing robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in both mice and rhesus macaques. Notably, the circRNA vaccine enabled higher and more durable antigen production than the 1mΨ-modified mRNA vaccine and elicited a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and distinct Th1-skewed immune responses. Importantly, we found that the circRNA RBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron but not the Delta variant. In contrast, the circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine protected against both Delta and Omicron or functioned as a booster after two doses of either native- or Delta-specific vaccination, making it a favorable choice against the current variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2.

Section: Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious worldwide public health emergency caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) ( Wu et al., 2020 88.

To date, COVID-19 has resulted in over 470 million confirmed cases and over 6 million confirmed deaths (World Health Organization). With the development of the epidemic, variants with immune escapability have appeared, the most serious of which is Omicron. By the end of January 2022, Omicron accounted for ∼85% of COVID-19 cases (GISAID). Omicron carries over 30 mutations on the spike protein, 15 of which are located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2022 17. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Huo, J. ∙ Zhou, D. ...

Planas, D. ∙ Saunders, N. ∙ Maes, P. ... Considerable escape of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron to antibody neutralization Nature. 2022; 602 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (947) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although it has recently been reported that an additional boost with original SARS-CoV-2 vaccines after receiving a prior two-dose vaccination regimen could partly elevate the neutralizing capability, the neutralization of Omicron pseudovirus was 4- to 13-fold lower than that of the wild type ( Garcia-Beltran et al., 2022 27. Garcia-Beltran, W.F. ∙ St Denis, K.J. ∙ Hoelzemer, A. ... mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine boosters induce neutralizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Cell. 2022; 185 :457-466.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (684) PubMed Google Scholar ). This poses a severe challenge to the efficacy of current vaccines, highlighting the urgent need to develop effective vaccines against such fast-spreading variants.
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family ( V'Kovski et al., 2021 79. V'Kovski, P. ∙ Kratzel, A. ∙ Steiner, S. ... Coronavirus biology and replication: implications for SARS-CoV-2 Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2021; 19 :155-170 Crossref Scopus (1726) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2 is a single-strand, positive-sense, enveloped virus, with an inner capsid formed by a 30-kb RNA genome wrapped by the nucleocapsid (N) proteins and a lipid envelope coated with the membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins ( Kim et al., 2020 41.

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, composed of the S1 and S2 subunits, is the major surface protein of the virion. The S protein mediates viral entry into host cells by binding to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the RBD at the C terminus of the S1 subunit. This binding subsequently induces the fusion between the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and the host cell membrane mediated by the S2 subunit, which leads to the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 33.

The S protein, S1 subunit, or RBD antigen of SARS-CoV-2 can induce both B cell and T cell responses, generating highly potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 ( Bangaru et al., 2020 2.

Vaccination is the most promising approach to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional vaccine platforms such as inactivated, virus-like particles and viral vector-based vaccines have been adopted to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines ( Dai et al., 2020 16.

A thermostable mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 182 :1271-1283.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ), even though the strategy was still in clinical trials and had never been applied commercially before ( Pardi et al., 2018 62. Pardi, N. ∙ Hogan, M.J. ∙ Porter, F.W. ... mRNA vaccines - a new era in vaccinology Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2018; 17 :261-279 Crossref Scopus (2548) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mRNA vaccine contains a linear single-stranded RNA consisting of a 5′ cap, the untranslated region (UTR), the antigen-coding region, and a 3′ polyA tail and is delivered into the body via lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulation ( Pardi et al., 2018 62. Pardi, N. ∙ Hogan, M.J. ∙ Porter, F.W. ... mRNA vaccines - a new era in vaccinology Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2018; 17 :261-279 Crossref Scopus (2548) PubMed Google Scholar ). The clinical-scale mRNA vaccines could be manufactured rapidly upon the release of the viral antigen sequence ( Corbett et al., 2020a 14. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Edwards, D.K. ∙ Leist, S.R. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine design enabled by prototype pathogen preparedness Nature. 2020; 586 :567-571 Crossref Scopus (927) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, due to its susceptibility to exonuclease digestion, the current mRNA vaccine still has certain limitations including inherent instability and suboptimal thermostability after LNP encapsulation for in vivo administration ( Durymanov and Reineke, 2018 21.

The promise of mRNA vaccines: a biotech and industrial perspective npj Vaccines. 2020; 5 :11 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, mRNA vaccine manufacturing necessitates an extremely sterile and strictly RNase-free environment during the whole production process, and its storage and distribution often requires low-temperature cold chain, limiting its availability in low-resource countries or regions ( Uddin and Roni, 2021 77. Uddin, M.N. ∙ Roni, M.A. Challenges of storage and stability of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines Vaccines (Basel). 2021; 9 :1033 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, because the mRNA produced by in vitro transcription (IVT) has a rather short half-life in cells, it requires additional nucleotide modifications (e.g., 1-methylpseudouridine) to improve its stability while reducing the risk of unwanted immunogenicity ( Karikó et al., 2005 38.

Unlike the linear conformation of mRNA, circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed ring RNA molecules that comprise a large class of noncoding RNAs generated in eukaryotic cells by a noncanonical RNA splicing event, called backsplicing( Chen, 2016 11.

Complementary sequence-mediated exon circularization Cell. 2014; 159 :134-147 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1477) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared with the linear mRNA, circRNA is highly stable due to its covalently closed ring structure, which protects it from exonuclease-mediated degradation ( Enuka et al., 2016 22. Enuka, Y. ∙ Lauriola, M. ∙ Feldman, M.E. ...

Circular RNAs are a large class of animal RNAs with regulatory potency Nature. 2013; 495 :333-338 Crossref Scopus (6114) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been reported that circRNAs were more stable than their linear mRNA counterparts, with the circRNAs having the median half-life at least 2.5 times longer than their linear mRNA isoforms in mammalian cells ( Enuka et al., 2016 22. Enuka, Y. ∙ Lauriola, M. ∙ Feldman, M.E. ...

Circular RNAs are a large class of animal RNAs with regulatory potency Nature. 2013; 495 :333-338 Crossref Scopus (6114) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, only a few endogenous circRNAs have been shown to function as protein translation templates ( Gao et al., 2021 26. Gao, X. ∙ Xia, X. ∙ Li, F. ...

Commun. 2018; 9 :4475 Crossref Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although circRNA lacks the essential elements for cap-dependent translation, it can be engineered to enable protein translation through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or the incorporation of the m6A modification upstream of the open reading frame (ORF) ( Wesselhoeft et al., 2018 85. Wesselhoeft, R.A. ∙ Kowalski, P.S. ∙ Anderson, D.G. Engineering circular RNA for potent and stable translation in eukaryotic cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2629 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2017 92. Yang, Y. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Mao, M. ... Extensive translation of circular RNAs driven by N(6)-methyladenosine Cell Res. 2017; 27 :626-641 Crossref Scopus (1342) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we envisioned that circRNA could be leveraged as a platform to generate immunogens.
Although the potential immunogenicity of IVT-produced circRNA has been the source of much debate ( Chen et al., 2019 13. Chen, Y.G. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Ahmad, S. ...

RNA circularization diminishes immunogenicity and can extend translation duration in vivo Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :508-520.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is tempting to test whether circRNA could be developed into a safe and effective vaccine platform. Given the inherent stability and an avoidable need for nucleotide modifications, we attempted to develop circRNA vaccines, aiming to provide effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants.

Section: Results

We employed the group I intron autocatalysis strategy ( Wesselhoeft et al., 2018 85. Wesselhoeft, R.A. ∙ Kowalski, P.S. ∙ Anderson, D.G. Engineering circular RNA for potent and stable translation in eukaryotic cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2629 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ) to produce circRNAs encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigens, termed circRNA RBD ( Figure 1 A). In this construct, the IRES element was placed before the RBD-coding sequence to initiate its translation. To enhance the immunogenicity of RBD antigens, the signal peptide sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was fused to the N terminus of RBD to ensure the secretion of antigens ( Kou et al., 2017 43. Kou, Y. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Zhao, Z. ... Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal sequence enhances immunogenicity of MVA-based vaccine against tuberculosis Immunol.

In addition, recent research reported that spike trimers outperformed monomeric spikes in binding human ACE2 (hACE2) ( Bouwman et al., 2021 5. Bouwman, K.M. ∙ Tomris, I. ∙ Turner, H.L. ...

Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; 367 :1444-1448 Crossref Scopus (3567) PubMed Google Scholar ). To improve the immunogenicity of RBD antigens, the trimerization motif of bacteriophage T4 fibritin protein (foldon) ( Papanikolopoulou et al., 2008 60. Papanikolopoulou, K. ∙ van Raaij, M.J. ∙ Mitraki, A. Creation of hybrid nanorods from sequences of natural trimeric fibrous proteins using the fibritin trimerization motif Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 474 :15-33 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) was fused to its C terminus. This IRES-SP-RBD-foldon sequence was then cloned into the vector to construct the IVT template for producing circRNA RBD ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ).
To produce high-purity circRNA RBD , we first optimized the IVT reaction to generate circRNA RBD ( Figure S1 A) without the extra step of GTP catalysis ( Wesselhoeft et al., 2018 85. Wesselhoeft, R.A. ∙ Kowalski, P.S. ∙ Anderson, D.G. Engineering circular RNA for potent and stable translation in eukaryotic cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2629 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis determined that the latter half of the main peak contained high-purity circRNA ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Then we successfully manufactured circRNA RBD in large quantities ( Figures S1 D and S1E). We found that the majority of the purified circRNA RBD fractions were resistant to exonuclease-RNase R, whereas the nicked RNA RBD were almost completely degraded, indicating that purified circRNA RBD were mostly in circular format ( Figure S1 F). The purity of circRNA RBD was over 90%, calculated via the denaturing gel electrophoresis and the subsequent semi-quantitative analysis ( Figures S1 G–S1I). The circularization of circRNA RBD was further verified by reverse transcription-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNase H-mediated specific cleavage ( Figures S1 J–S1M).
To test the secretory expression of RBD produced by circRNA RBD , the purified circRNA RBD was transfected into HEK293T cells or NIH3T3 cells. Abundant RBD antigens in the supernatant of both human and murine cells were detected by western blot, indicating the high compatibility of circRNAs ( Figure 1 B). With the help of foldon, the circRNA RBD encoded stable homogeneous RBD trimers in the supernatant, which were dissociated into monomers under reducing conditions ( Figure 1 C). The concentration of RBD antigens produced by circRNA RBD reached ∼1,400 ng/mL, 600-fold higher than those produced by its linear precursor RNA ( Figure 1 D).
In addition to the group I intron-based strategy, we also developed a T4 RNA ligase-based method to produce circRNAs. This method adopted the complementary pairing sequence of split IRES as the splint instead of a DNA splint to generate an intramolecular RNA nick structure serving as the catalytic substrate of T4 RNA ligase ( Figure S2 A; Table S2 ). Sanger sequencing confirmed the precise circularization of circRNA RBD by this approach ( Figure S2 B). Similarly, abundant RBD antigens were detected in the supernatant at a concentration of ∼1,000 ng/mL, which was ∼200-fold higher than those produced by its linear precursor RNA ( Figures S2 C and S2D).
To verify whether the secreted SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigens produced by circRNA RBD were functional, the supernatants of circRNA RBD -transfected cells were used in a competition assay using hACE2-overexpressing HEK293 cells (HEK293T-ACE2) and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus harboring an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter ( Ou et al., 2020 59. Ou, X. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Lei, X. ... Characterization of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 on virus entry and its immune cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1620 Crossref Scopus (2252) PubMed Google Scholar ). The secreted RBD antigens could effectively block SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection ( Figure 1 E).
To explore whether circRNA could be leveraged to create a vaccine, we attempted to assess the immunogenicity of circRNA RBD encapsulated with LNP in BALB/c mice ( Figure 1 F). The circRNA RBD encapsulation efficiency was greater than 93%, with an average diameter of 100 nm ( Figure 1 G). Mice were immunized through intramuscular (i.m.) injection with 10 or 50 μg of LNP-circRNA RBD vaccines twice at a 2-week interval ( Figure 1 H). The circRNA RBD elicited a high level of RBD-specific IgG endpoint geometric mean titers (GMTs), reaching ∼1.9 × 10 4 for the 10-μg dose and ∼5.7 × 10 5 for the 50-μg dose ( Figure 1 I).
Sera from circRNA RBD -vaccinated mice effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with a 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of ∼4.5 × 10 3 ( Figure 1 J) and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with an NT50 of ∼7.0 × 10 4 ( Figure 1 K).
Next, we evaluated the efficacy of circRNA RBD-Beta , a circRNA vaccine encoding RBD/K417N-E484K-N501Y antigens derived from the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. Mice were immunized with LNP-circRNA RBD-Beta through i.m. injection twice at a 2-week interval. The immunized mice’s sera were collected at 1 and 2 weeks after the boost. ELISA showed that the RBD-Beta-specific IgG endpoint GMT was ∼1.6 × 10 4 at 1 week after the boost ( Figure 1 L). Pseudovirus neutralization assays revealed that circRNA RBD -elicited antibodies could effectively neutralize all three pseudoviruses, with the highest neutralizing activity against the native (D614G) strain ( Figure 1 M). The circRNA RBD-Beta -elicited antibodies could also neutralize all three pseudoviruses, with the highest activity against its corresponding Beta variant ( Figure 1 N).
In line with pseudovirus neutralization assay, the sera from immunized mice neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 Beta and native (D614G) strains with NT50 values of 2.6 × 10 4 ( Figure 1 O) and 6.0 × 10 3 ( Figure 1 P), respectively.
To further evaluate the protective efficacy of circRNA RBD-Beta vaccine, we employed the authentic Beta variant for challenge experiments. Consistent with a recent report ( Gu et al., 2020 30. Gu, H. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Yang, G. ... Adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice for testing vaccine efficacy Science. 2020; 369 :1603-1607 Crossref Scopus (521) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2021 12. Chen, Q. ∙ Huang, X.Y. ∙ Sun, M.X. ... Transient acquisition of cross-species infectivity during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Natl. Sci. Rev. 2021; 8 :nwab167 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Montagutelli et al., 2021 55. Montagutelli, X. ∙ Prot, M. ∙ Levillayer, L. ... Variants with the N501Y mutation extend SARS-CoV-2 host range to mice, with contact transmission Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), the Beta variant could infect wild-type BALB/c mice and replicate in their lungs ( Figure 1 Q), likely due to mutations in the spike such as K417N, E484K, and N501Y. Notably, 7 weeks after the boost dose, the RBD-Beta-specific IgG endpoint GMT was still approximately 1.2 × 10 4 ( Figure 1 R), with significant neutralizing activity against RBD-Beta antigens ( Figure 1 S). Each immunized mouse was then intranasally infected with 5 × 10 4 plaque forming unit (PFU) of Beta virus (7 weeks post-boost). Lung tissues were collected 3 days after the challenge for the detection of viral RNAs. The viral loads in the lungs of circRNA-vaccinated mice were significantly lower than those of the placebo group ( Figure 1 T). Consistently, only the mice in the placebo group exhibited weight loss ( Figure 1 U). These results indicated that the circRNA RBD-Beta vaccine could effectively protect the mice against SARS-CoV-2 Beta.
Considering that a high dose of circRNA RBD was necessary to elicit maximal level of neutralizing antibodies, we postulated that the LNP delivery platform might have a great impact on the efficacy of the circRNA vaccine. After multiple tests, we were able to significantly lower the vaccine dose using one of the commercial formulas (Precision Nanosystems). In this regard, 10 μg of circRNA could induce neutralizing antibodies at a comparable level to 50 μg ( Figure 1 V). We thus switched our choice of LNP for the rest of our experiments.
The Delta variant, like the Beta variant, partially escapes the antibodies produced in survivors or vaccinees ( Lustig et al., 2021 52. Lustig, Y. ∙ Zuckerman, N. ∙ Nemet, I. ... Neutralising capacity against Delta (B.1.617.2) and other variants of concern following Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccination in health care workers, Israel Euro Surveill. 2021; 26 :2100557 Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar ; Planas et al., 2021 64. Planas, D. ∙ Veyer, D. ∙ Baidaliuk, A. ... Reduced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta to antibody neutralization Nature. 2021; 596 :276-280 Crossref Scopus (1454) PubMed Google Scholar ; Torgovnick, 2021 76. Torgovnick, J. Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385 :e92 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). To develop such a variant-specific vaccine, we adopted both group I intron and T4 RNA ligase ligation strategies to produce circRNA RBD-Delta . Mice were immunized i.m. with 0.5, 2.5, 5, or 10 μg of circRNA RBD-Delta vaccines twice at a 2-week interval. Then, 2 weeks after the boost dose, the sera from immunized mice were collected to detect RBD-Delta-specific antibodies. Vaccines of circRNA RBD-Delta made by either circularization method could induce high endpoint GMTs ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The sera from circRNA RBD-Delta -vaccinated mice effectively neutralized the Delta pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, with an NT50 of ∼1.4 × 10 5 for the 10-μg dose ( Figure 2 C).
Importantly, circRNA RBD-Delta vaccines could provide protection against other variants, including the native strain, Alpha and Beta, albeit to varying degrees. The sera from circRNA RBD-Delta -immunized mice exhibited the highest neutralizing activity against Delta and the lowest against Beta ( Figures 2 D and 2E).
CircRNAs are reportedly more stable than mRNAs owing to their covalent closed circular structure ( Fischer and Leung, 2017 24. Fischer, J.W. ∙ Leung, A.K. CircRNAs: a regulator of cellular stress Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2017; 52 :220-233 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether the stability of the circRNA vaccine could confer higher and more durable antigen-encoding efficiency than the mRNA vaccine, we generated 1mΨ-modified mRNA (1mΨ-mRNA), and unmodified mRNA, both of which contained the same RBD-encoding sequence as the circRNA for a fair comparison ( Figure S3 A; Table S3 ). The circRNA produced much higher levels of RBD antigens at all time points than both 1mΨ-mRNA and unmodified mRNA, and they were maintained for a longer period ( Figure 3 A). RT-qPCR showed that circRNAs were more stable than mRNAs, modified or unmodified ( Figure 3 B). Importantly, LNP encapsulation further enhanced the advantage of circRNA in protein production and durability from both 1mΨ-mRNA and unmodified mRNA ( Figure 3 C). Interestingly, LNP encapsulation appeared to improve the antigen-encoding efficiency of unmodified mRNA to a level comparable with that of 1mΨ-mRNA ( Figure 3 C).
We found that even after 2 weeks of storage at room temperature (∼25°C), the circRNA could express RBD antigens without detectable loss ( Figure 3 D), highlighting its remarkable thermal stability. To further evaluate the thermostability of the vaccines, the LNP-encapsulated circRNA, 1mΨ-mRNA, and unmodified mRNA were stored at 4°C, ∼25°C, or 37°C for up to 28 days prior to transfection. At all temperatures tested, circRNA expressed higher levels of antigens than those of the other two mRNA groups ( Figures S3 B–S3D). At 4°C, little reduction in RBD antigens produced by LNP-circRNA could be detected from 1 to 28 days ( Figure S3 B). The stability of LNP-circRNA, 1mΨ-mRNA, or unmodified mRNA was clearly reduced with increasing storage temperature, especially at 37°C ( Figures S3 C and S3D).
Importantly, we found that the innate immune responses elicited by LNP-encapsulated circRNA RBD were comparable with those by LNP-encapsulated 1mΨ-mRNA RBD and significantly lower than those by the transfected RNAs ( Figure 3 E).
Given that circRNA vaccines possess higher stability and antigen-encoding efficiency, we wondered whether they exhibited distinctive immunogenicity, compared with mRNA vaccines. We compared the balance of Th1/Th2 immune responses between circRNA RBD-Delta and mRNA RBD-Delta vaccines, because Th2-biased immune responses might induce vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) ( Corbett et al., 2020a 14. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Edwards, D.K. ∙ Leist, S.R. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine design enabled by prototype pathogen preparedness Nature. 2020; 586 :567-571 Crossref Scopus (927) PubMed Google Scholar ; Graham, 2020 29. Graham, B.S.

COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b1 elicits human antibody and TH1 T cell responses Nature. 2020; 586 :594-599 Crossref Scopus (1320) PubMed Google Scholar ). ELISA showed that the total IgG elicited by circRNA RBD-Delta was comparable with that by 1mΨ-mRNA RBD-Delta ( Figure 3 F); however, the ratios of IgG2a/IgG1, IgG2c/IgG1, or (IgG2a + IgG2c)/IgG1 from circRNA RBD-Delta were consistently higher than those from 1mΨ-mRNA RBD-Delta vaccine ( Figures 3 G, 3H, S3 E, and S3F), and this Th1-skewed T cell immune response was believed beneficial for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 ( Corbett et al., 2020a 14.

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection by virus-specific antibodies is another potential concern for vaccines that has been reported for infections by some viruses, including Zika, Dengue, and coronaviruses ( Dowd and Pierson, 2011 19. Dowd, K.A. ∙ Pierson, T.C.

Dis. 2020; 100 :483-489 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous research has reported that virus-binding antibodies without neutralizing activity elicited by infection or vaccination possibly caused ADE effects, especially for those viruses with different serotypes ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2010 18. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Jumnainsong, A. ∙ Onsirisakul, N. ... Cross-reacting antibodies enhance dengue virus infection in humans Science. 2010; 328 :745-748 Crossref Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martínez-Vega et al., 2017 53. Martínez-Vega, R.A. ∙ Carrasquila, G. ∙ Luna, E. ... ADE and dengue vaccination Vaccine. 2017; 35 :3910-3912 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we compared the ratios of neutralizing to binding antibodies between circRNA and 1mΨ-mRNA vaccines. Although circRNA RBD-Delta exhibited equal neutralizing capability to 1mΨ-mRNA RBD-Delta ( Figures 3 I–3L), the former induced higher proportions of neutralizing antibodies at both 2.5- and 10-μg doses in mice ( Figure 3 M). Owing to this unique feature, the circRNA vaccine might have a certain advantage in circumventing potential ADE effects caused by viruses such as Dengue and Zika and better tolerating frequent viral mutations.
B cells, CD4 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells mediated effector functions against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients ( Sette and Crotty, 2021 72. Sette, A. ∙ Crotty, S. Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Cell. 2021; 184 :861-880 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1124) PubMed Google Scholar ). To compare CD4 + and CD8 + T cell immune responses, the splenocytes of immunized mice were collected and stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Delta pooled peptides ( Table S4 ), and cytokine-producing T cells were quantified by intracellular cytokine staining among effector memory T cells (Tem, CD44 + CD62L − ) ( Figure S4 ). After stimulation with peptides, CD8 + T cells producing IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 were detected in mice immunized with the circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine or 1mΨ-mRNA RBD-Delta vaccine ( Figures 4 A–4C), indicating the RBD-specific CD8 + T cell responses elicited by both vaccines. The CD4 + T cells of immunized mice induced strong IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 responses but minimal IL-4 responses ( Figures 4 D–4G). Consistent with the above results ( Figures 3 G, 3H, S3 E, and S3F), these indicated that circRNA vaccines induced Th1-biased T cell immune responses ( Figures 4 D–4G and S5 A–S5D).
To cope with the current Omicron emergency, we tested the neutralizing capability elicited by all three circRNA vaccines against the Omicron variant. The neutralizing activity against Omicron elicited by each one of the three circRNA vaccines dropped 74-fold (native), 15-fold (Beta), and 44-fold (Delta) in comparison with the neutralizing activity against their corresponding variants ( Figure 5 A). Among all three, the circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine maintained sufficient neutralizing activity against Omicron ( Figure 5 A), with an NT50 of ∼4.7 × 10 3 , whereas the NT50 of the circRNA RBD-Beta against Omicron dropped below 5 × 10 2 ( Figure 5 A). Compared with the mRNA RBD-Delta vaccine, the circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine elicited comparable neutralizing activity against both Delta and Omicron variants for mouse sera collected 2 weeks after the boost (short-term) and 7 weeks after the boost (long-term) ( Figures 5 A–5C). Similar to the above observations ( Figure 3 M), the circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine also elicited a higher average proportion of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron variant than the 1mΨ-mRNA RBD-Delta vaccine at both 2 weeks after the boost (short-term) and 7 weeks after the boost (long-term) ( Figures S6 A–S6D), indicating the potential superiority of the circRNA vaccine against the circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2.
We developed an Omicron-specific circRNA vaccine that expressed the trimeric RBD antigens of the Omicron variant. Mice were immunized i.m. with 5 or 10 μg of circRNA RBD-Omicron vaccines twice at a 2-week interval. Then,1 week after the boost dose, the serum samples from immunized mice were collected for the detection of specific antibodies. The circRNA RBD-Omicron vaccine induced Omicron spike-specific antibodies with the endpoint GMTs of ∼4.7 × 10 4 for the 5-μg dose and ∼2.2 × 10 5 for the 10-μg dose ( Figure 5 D), yielding clear neutralizing activities against Omicron with NT50 values of ∼2.5 × 10 3 for the 5-μg dose and ∼8.6 × 10 3 for the 10-μg dose ( Figure 5 E). However, neutralizing activity could hardly be detected against the native strain or Delta variant ( Figures 5 E and 5F).
We next investigated the feasibility of circRNA vaccines as a booster. Mice immunized with two doses of circRNA RBD-Delta vaccines received a 3 rd booster with circRNA RBD-Beta , circRNA RBD-Delta , or circRNA RBD-Omicron vaccine at 7 weeks after the 2 nd dose, followed by the assessment of neutralizing activity at 1 week after boost ( Figure 5 G). Only circRNA RBD-Delta effectively boosted the neutralizing antibodies against both Delta ( Figure 5 H) and Omicron ( Figure 5 I). By contrast, the 3 rd boost with the circRNA RBD-Beta or circRNA RBD-Omicron vaccine failed to elevate the neutralizing capability against Delta or Omicron ( Figures 5 H and 5I).
We then tested the 3 rd booster with circRNA RBD or circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine in mice previously immunized with two-dose circRNA RBD vaccines ( Figure 5 J). Both vaccines effectively boosted neutralizing antibodies against both Delta ( Figure 5 K) and Omicron ( Figure 5 L). CircRNA RBD-Delta appeared to be a much better booster than circRNA RBD against both Delta and Omicron variants, which elevated the geometric mean NT50 from ∼4 × 10 2 to ∼3.2 × 10 4 against the Omicron ( Figures 5 K and 5L).
Taken together, these results suggest that circRNA RBD-Delta might be a favorable choice for vaccination to provide broad-spectrum protection against the current VOCs.
To further assess the immunogenicity of circRNA vaccine in nonhuman primates (NHPs), groups of 2- to 4-year-old rhesus macaques were immunized i.m. with 20, 100, or 500 μg of circRNA RBD vaccines, 100 μg of circRNA Ctrl , or PBS control on days 0 and 21 ( Figure 6 A). The specific antibodies were measured using the rhesus macaque plasma collected at 2 weeks after the boost ( Figure 6 A). The IgG endpoint GMTs reached ∼2.1 × 10 4 (20-μg dose), ∼1.6 × 10 4 (100-μg dose), and ∼7 × 10 3 (500-μg dose) for circRNA RBD vaccines, whereas circRNA Ctrl - or PBS-immunized rhesus macaques failed to induce RBD-specific antibodies ( Figure 6 B). The pseudovirus neutralization assay showed NT50 values of ∼180 for the 20-μg dose, ∼520 for the 100-μg dose, and ∼390 for the 500-μg dose ( Figure 6 C). The authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay showed NT50 values of ∼80 for the 20-μg dose, ∼120 for the 100-μg dose, and ∼50 for the 500-μg dose ( Figures 6 D and 6E).
We then performed a cross-neutralizing assay. Both the pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays showed that the circRNA RBD vaccine-immunized rhesus macaque plasma could effectively inhibit the corresponding native strain, whereas the Alpha, Delta, and Beta variants could also be inhibited, but with reduced activity, especially against the Beta variant ( Figures 6 D and 6E).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected on the day before challenge with SARS-CoV-2. The RBD-specific T cell responses in rhesus macaques were measured using PBMCs stimulated with the RBD peptide pools ( Table S5 ). The ELISpot assay showed evident IFN-γ and IL-2 responses but nearly undetectable IL-4 in circRNA RBD -immunized rhesus macaques ( Figure 6 F), indicating a Th1-biased T cell immune response.
Next, 5 weeks after the boost dose, the immunized rhesus macaques were challenged with 1 × 10 6 PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 native strain as described previously ( Vogel et al., 2021 80. Vogel, A.B. ∙ Kanevsky, I. ∙ Che, Y. ... BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2021; 592 :283-289 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ). The challenged rhesus macaques were euthanized at 7 days post-infection (dpi), and the lung tissues underwent viral load and histopathological assays. The RT-qPCR assay, using primers targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (N gene), indicated that the rhesus macaques immunized with 100 or 500 μg of circRNA RBD vaccine were well protected as the viral genomic RNAs were reduced nearly 1,000-fold, compared with the control groups ( Figure 6 G). To detect the actively replicative viral loads, we performed qPCR using primers targeting SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (E gene) and found that rhesus macaques immunized with circRNA RBD at all three doses had nearly no detectable viral subgenomic RNA in the lung tissues ( Figure 6 G).
Further histopathological examination demonstrated that circRNA RBD -immunized rhesus macaques of all doses were well protected because only very mild pneumonia was observed ( Figure 6 H). By contrast, severe pneumonia was observed in the lungs of the two control groups, as exemplified by local pulmonary septal thickening, moderate hemorrhage in the pulmonary septals, a large number of scattered dust cells, and massive inflammatory cell infiltration ( Figure 6 H). The pathological scores further confirmed that circRNA RBD immunization significantly protected the rhesus macaques against COVID-19 ( Figure 6 I), likely resulting from a synergy between the humoral immune responses and T cell responses by vaccination ( Figure 6 J).
To further evaluate the safety of circRNA vaccines in NHPs, physiological and biochemical indicators were monitored. No severe clinical adverse effects were observed following the priming or boost dose. CircRNA RBD vaccines induced evident IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) ( Figures S7 A and S7B), whereas TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-α were nearly undetectable ( Figures S7 C–S7E). The body temperatures of both immunized rhesus macaques and controls were within the normal range after prime and boost ( Figure S7 F). None of the challenged macaques showed clinical signs of illness ( Figures S7 G–S7K). Collectively, our study provides preliminary proof of safety for the circRNA vaccination in NHPs.
In addition to vaccines, circRNAs could be repurposed for therapeutics when used to express other proteins, antibodies, or peptides. Here, we attempted to test the therapeutic potential of circRNAs by expressing antibodies. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies or hACE2 decoys can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Linsky et al., 2020 48. Linsky, T.W. ∙ Vergara, R. ∙ Codina, N. ...

Chan, K.K. ∙ Dorosky, D. ∙ Sharma, P. ... Engineering human ACE2 to optimize binding to the spike protein of SARS coronavirus 2 Science. 2020; 369 :1261-1265 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This prompted us to leverage the circRNA platform to express SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies and hACE2 decoys ( Figure 7 A). Pseudovirus neutralization assays showed that supernatants of HEK293T cells transfected with circRNA nAB or circRNA hACE2 decoys could effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection ( Figure 7 B).
Next, we tested neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 variants, Alpha and Beta. The supernatants of circRNA nAB1-Tri and circRNA nAB3-Tri effectively blocked Alpha and D614G pseudovirus infection ( Figure 7 C). However, both nanobodies showed markedly decreased neutralizing activity against Beta variant ( Figure 7 C). The hACE2 decoys showed no inhibition activity against Alpha and Beta variants ( Figure 7 C).

COVID-19 is still a fast-growing global health crisis with circulating SAS-CoV-2 variants evading immunity from prior vaccination or viral infection, especially with the emerging Delta and Omicron VOCs ( Karim and Karim, 2021 39.

The circRNA-encoded RBD trimers were functional and successfully induced potent neutralizing antibodies and specific T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 in both mice and rhesus macaques ( Figures 2 , 4 , and 6 ).

In comparison with the mRNA vaccine, the circRNA vaccine elicited higher and more durable immunogens, leading to distinct Th1-biased T cell immune responses from the mRNA vaccine ( Figures 3 and S3 ). Moreover, the circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine induced a higher average proportion of neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron variants than the mRNA RBD-Delta vaccine ( Figures 3 M and S6 ). We infer that the more durable antigen production and distinct immunogenicity of circRNA vaccine ( Figures 3 A–3E) enable the elicitation of a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and distinct Th1-skewed immune responses than the 1mΨ-modified mRNA vaccine ( Figures 3 G–3M), by promoting and elongating the antibody affinity maturation process in germinal centers after vaccination ( Alameh et al., 2021 1.

A recent preprint reported that vaccinees who received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine exhibited enhanced neutralizing antibodies against Delta variant after infection with Omicron, implying that an Omicron vaccine might provide broad-spectrum protection against other variants ( Khan et al., 2021 40. Khan, K. ∙ Karim, F. ∙ Cele, S. ... Omicron infection enhances neutralizing immunity against the Delta variant Preprint at medRxiv. 2021; 2021.12.27.21268439 Google Scholar ). Our result argues against this possibility because our Omicron-specific vaccine failed to cross-protect against the Delta variant ( Figures 5 D–5F) or boost the two-dose Delta vaccine ( Figures 5 H and 5I). By contrast, the circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine appeared to produce antigens possessing high immunogenicity and consequently elicit a high level of neutralizing antibodies against Delta ( Figures 2 and 3 ). Our Delta-specific vaccination could cross-protect against all other variants, including Omicron ( Figures 2 E, 5 A, 5B, and 5C), and could also be used as an effective booster following two-dose original SARS-CoV-2 vaccines ( Figures 5 K and 5L). It is hoped that further testing will show that the circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine could be applied as an effective booster for current major vaccines.
Currently, mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 were widely administrated, both of which were produced with complete replacement of uridine by 1-methylpseudouridine to reduce unwanted immunogenicity ( Corbett et al., 2020a 14. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Edwards, D.K. ∙ Leist, S.R. ...

In this study, no nucleotide modification was used for the circRNA vaccine. We found that the immunogenicity of LNP-encapsulated circRNA RBD was at a comparable level with that of LNP-encapsulated 1mΨ-mRNA RBD in the cell culture ( Figure 3 E). Moreover, although our study was not specifically designed for studying the safety of vaccines or drugs, it is worth noting that circRNA vaccine did not cause clinical signs of illness or enhanced pathology in vaccinated NHPs, thereby opening avenues for the development of circRNA-based vaccines or drugs ( Figures 6 and S7 ). It will be interesting to see if nucleotide modifications can further improve the therapeutic applicability of circRNAs in future studies, given that it is currently technically challenging because the 1mΨ modification would disrupt IRES function ( Wesselhoeft et al., 2019 86. Wesselhoeft, R.A. ∙ Kowalski, P.S. ∙ Parker-Hale, F.C. ... RNA circularization diminishes immunogenicity and can extend translation duration in vivo Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :508-520.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this study, we also tested the therapeutic potential of circRNAs that encode SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing nanobodies ( Barnes et al., 2020 3. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ...

USA. 2020; 117 :28046-28055 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could effectively neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus ( Figure 7 ). Beyond viral receptors, this circRNA expression platform holds the potential to become a therapeutic drug encoding therapeutic antibodies in vivo , such as anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies ( Boutros et al., 2016 4. Boutros, C. ∙ Tarhini, A. ∙ Routier, E. ... Safety profiles of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies alone and in combination Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2016; 13 :473-486 Crossref Scopus (792) PubMed Google Scholar ; He and Xu, 2020 32. He, X. ∙ Xu, C. Immune checkpoint signaling and cancer immunotherapy Cell Res. 2020; 30 :660-669 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike antibodies and protein drugs, circRNAs encode therapeutic antibodies in the cytoplasm, allowing them to target intracellular targets such as TP53 ( Sabapathy and Lane, 2018 68. Sabapathy, K. ∙ Lane, D.P. Therapeutic targeting of p53: all mutants are equal, but some mutants are more equal than others Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 15 :13-30 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ) and KRAS ( Mukhopadhyay et al., 2021 57. Mukhopadhyay, S. ∙ Vander Heiden, M.G. ∙ McCormick, F. The metabolic landscape of RAS-driven Cancers from biology to therapy Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :271-283 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ), bypassing the cytomembrane barrier.
In summary, circRNA holds the potential to become an effective and safe platform for vaccination against viral infection—including SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants—as well as possibly becoming a therapeutic platform, owing to its specific properties.
The small numbers of rhesus macaques we used for the challenge experiments led to high variations and large error bars in the evaluation of circRNA vaccines. The immunogenicity of IVT-produced circRNAs is another potential concern ( Chen et al., 2019 13. Chen, Y.G. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Ahmad, S. ...

RNA circularization diminishes immunogenicity and can extend translation duration in vivo Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :508-520.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even though our study showed that circRNA vaccines did not cause any clinical signs of illness in rhesus macaques, even at high doses (500 μg per rhesus macaque) ( Figure 6 ), the safety of circRNA vaccines awaits further investigation in NHPs and clinical trials. In the current study, we observed that the circRNA vaccine outperformed its mRNA vaccine counterpart in several aspects; however, more detailed and comprehensive comparisons need to be conducted in the future. It is worth noting that the mRNA vaccine we used for the comparison study is different from the two widely administered vaccines, mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, both of which encode the full-length spike antigens and were produced by different manufacturing processes, whereas the mRNA vaccine in this study encoded the trimeric RBD of spike ( Corbett et al., 2020a 14.

Authentic viruses were amplified from Vero-E6 cells and concentrated by an ultrafilter system via a 300 kD module (Millipore). Amplified SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed via RT–PCR, sequencing and transmission electronic microscopy, and titrated via plaque assay (10 6 PFU/ml).
The 5’ homology arm sequence, 3’ group I intron sequence, linker-1 sequence, IRES sequence, linker-2 sequence, 5’ group I intron sequence and 3’ homology arm sequence were PCR amplified and cloned into a plasmid backbone via the Gibson assembly strategy, generating the empty pcircRNA-EV backbone. Then, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen, EGFP, nanobody or hACE2-decoy-coding sequence was PCR amplified and cloned into the pcircRNA-EV backbone, and the corresponding pcircRNA plasmids were constructed for the following IVT reaction.
The production of circRNAs was performed according to previous reports ( Wesselhoeft et al., 2018 85. Wesselhoeft, R.A. ∙ Kowalski, P.S. ∙ Anderson, D.G. Engineering circular RNA for potent and stable translation in eukaryotic cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2629 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the circRNA precursors were synthesized via IVT from the linearized circRNA plasmid templates with the HiScribe™ T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, #E2040S). After IVT, the RNA products were treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs, #M0303S) for 30 min to digest the DNA templates. Optionally, after DNase I digestion, GTP was added to the reaction at a final concentration of 2 mM, and then the reactions were incubated at 55 °C for 15 min to catalyze the cyclization of circRNAs. Then, the RNA was column purified with the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (New England Biolabs, #T2040L). Then, the column-purified RNA was heated at 65 °C for 3 min and cooled on ice. The reactions were treated with RNase R (Epicenter, #RNR07250) at 37 °C for 15-30 min to further enrich the circRNAs. The RNase R-treated RNA was column purified. For optimized IVT reaction, circRNAs were directly column purified after IVT for further HPLC purification. The sequences of circRNAs produced via group I intron were provided in Table S1 .
We used split IRES strategy to produce circular RNAs by T4 RNA ligase 2 (NEB, #M0239). To test the potential split sites in CVB3 IRES sequence, we analyzed the second structure of IRES. After multiple tests and screens, we were able to determine the split site of CVB3 IRES at the 385 th nucleotide to allow T4 RNA ligase method for effective circularization. Then the circular RNA precursors were produced via in vitro transcription (NEB, E2040S) with added Guanosine monophosphates, and the RNA precursors were ligated by T4 RNA ligase 2 for 8 h at 25 °C. Finally, the ligated circular products were treated with RNase R to remove the linear RNA precursors. The sequences of circRNAs produced via T4 RNA ligases were provided in Table S2 .
To further enrich the circRNAs, the purified RNase R-treated RNA was resolved with high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent HPLC1260) using a 4.6 × 300 mm size-exclusion column with a particle size of 5 μm and pore size of 2000 Å (Sepax Technologies, #215980P-4630) in RNase-free TE buffer (Thermo, #T11493). The circRNA-enriched fractions were collected and then column purified. To further diminish the immunogenicity of the purified circRNAs, circRNAs were heated at 65 °C for 3 min, cooled on ice and subsequently treated with Quick CIP phosphatase (New England Biolabs, #M0525S). Finally, the circRNAs were column purified and concentrated with the RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (ZYMO, #R1018).
The production of mRNAs referred to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, we produced the mRNAs using the commercial HiScribe™ T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB, #E2040S) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the linearized plasmids containing the 5’-UTR, RBD-coding region, 3’-UTR and -81-nt polyA elements. For 1mΨ-modified mRNA production, the 1-Methylpseudouridine-5-Triphosphate (TriLink, #N-1081-10) was used instead of the unmodified 5-Triphosphate for the production of 1mΨ-modified mRNA. The m7G(5')ppp(5')G RNA Cap Structure Analog (NEB, #S1404) was used for cotranscriptional capping of mRNAs according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Final IVT products were column purified and concentrated with the RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (ZYMO, #R1018). The sequence of mRNA was provided in Table S3 .
The purified circRNA RBD , nicked linear RNA RBD and linear precursor were incubated with RNase H (NEB, M0297L). Site-specific cleavage was performed in reactions containing 500 ng of the targeted RNAs, 50 pmol of the sense or antisense ssDNA probe and RNase H buffer in a total volume of 18 μl. After incubation at 50 °C for 10 min, 2 μl of RNase H was added to the reaction for 1 h at 37 °C. The sequence of the sense primer is 5’-TATTCTGTCCTCTAC-3’, and the sequence of the antisense primer is 5’-GTAGAGGACAGAATA-3’.
The nicked RNA RBD or circRNA RBD was heated at 65 °C for 3 min before cooled on ice. The RNase R (Epicentre, #RNR07250) was then added and incubated at 37 °C for 5 or 15 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 2 × RNA loading dye (NEB, #B0363S), and RNAs were resolved in agarose-gel electrophoresis.
For circRNA transfection into HEK293T or NIH3T3 cells, 3×10 5 cells per well were seeded in 12-well plates. Two micrograms of circRNA was transfected into HEK293T or NIH3T3 cells using Lipofectamine MessengerMax (Invitrogen, #LMRNA003) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24-48 hr after transfection, the cell lysis and supernatant were collected for subsequent detection.
The circRNAs were encapsulated with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) according to a previously described process ( Ickenstein and Garidel, 2019 36. Ickenstein, L.M. ∙ Garidel, P. Lipid-based nanoparticle formulations for small molecules and RNA drugs Expert Opin. Drug Deliv. 2019; 16 :1205-1226 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, the circRNA was diluted with PNI Formulation Buffer (Precision NanoSystems, #NWW0043) to a final concentration of 170 μg/ml. Then, the lab-prepared or commercial LNP (Precision NanoSystems) were mixed with the circRNA solution at the volume ratio of 1:3 through the Ignite NxGen Cartridge (Precision NanoSystems, #NIT0002) using NanoAssemblr Ignite (Precision NanoSystems). Then the LNP-circRNA formulations were diluted 40-fold with 1×PBS buffer (pH 7.2∼7.4) and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore). The concentration and encapsulation rate of circRNAs were measured by the Quant-it RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, #R11490). The size of LNP-circRNA particles was measured using dynamic light scattering on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS 300 (Malvern). Samples were irradiated with a red laser, and scattered light was detected. The results were analyzed to obtain an autocorrelation function using the software Zetasizer V7.13.
RBD expression in cell culture supernatants was quantified with a commercial SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD Protein ELISA kit (ABclonal, #RK04135) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatants were diluted at proper ratio. Final concentrations of RBD were calculated based on the linear standard curve of absorbance at 450 nm, using 630 nm as a reference. Briefly, the detection wells were precoated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the spike RBD protein. After incubation with samples or standards at 37 °C for two hours, samples unbound to immobilized antibody were removed by washing steps. Then, RBD-specific antibodies were added to the wells for a one-hour incubation at 37 °C. After washing, the HRP substrates and stop solution were added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using 630 nm as a reference.
For mouse vaccination, groups of 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were intramuscularly immunized with LNP-circRNA RBD or a placebo (LNP only) in 100 μl using a 1-ml sterile syringe, and 2 or 3 weeks later, a second dose was administered to boost the immune responses. The sera of immunized mice were collected to detect the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG endpoint GMTs and neutralizing antibodies as described below.
All immunized mouse serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min before use. The SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody endpoint GMT was measured by ELISA. Briefly, serial 3-fold dilutions (in 1% BSA) of heat-inactivated sera, starting at 1:100, were added to 96-well plates (100 μl/well; Costar) coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD antigens (Sino Biological) and blocked with 1% BSA for 60 min at 37 °C. Then, after three washes with wash buffer, horseradish peroxidase HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted in 1% BSA at a 1:10,000 ratio was added to the plates and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, the plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer and added to TMB substrates (100 μl/well) followed by incubation for 15-20 min. Then, the ELISA stop buffer was added to the plates. Finally, the absorbance (450/630 nm) was measured with an Infinite M200 (TECAN). The IgG endpoint GMTs were defined as the dilution fold, which emitted an optical density exceeding 3x background (without serum but the secondary antibody was added).
The neutralizing activity of mouse serum samples was detected by a SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit (L00847A, GenScript). Detections were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serial 10-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated sera, starting at 1:10, were incubated with HRP-conjugated RBD solutions at 37 °C for half an hour, and then the mixtures were placed in 96-well plates precoated with human ACE2 (hACE2) proteins and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing the TMB substrates, stop solution were added, and the absorbance (450/630 nm) was measured with an Infinite M200 (TECAN). The inhibition rates of serum samples were calculated according to the following formula. The 50% neutralization geometric mean titer (NT50) was determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression in Prism 8 (GraphPad).

For the determination of the NT50 of immunized mouse serum, HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (50,000 cells/well) and incubated for approximately 24 hr until reaching over 90% confluence in preparation for pseudovirus infection. The mouse serum was diluted 3-fold, starting at 1:40, and incubated with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (MOI ≈ 0.05) at 37 °C for 60 min. DMEM without serum was used as the negative control group. Then, the supernatant of HEK293T-hACE2 cells was removed, and a mixture of serum and pseudovirus was added to each well. Thirty-six to 48 hr later, the luciferase activity, which reflects the degree of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus transfection, was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The NT50 was defined as the fold dilution that achieved more than 50% inhibition of pseudovirus infection compared with the control group.
The sera were serially diluted using complete DMEM as the culture medium in 96-well white plates for a total of six gradients, and then the virus solution with ∼1.3×10 4 TCID50 was added. Complete DMEM was used as the control group. After one hour of incubation in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 °C, Huh7 cells (100 μl/well) were added to the 96-well white plates, which were adjusted to a concentration of 2×10 5 cells/ml. After 24 h of incubation in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 °C, the culture supernatant was aspirated gently to leave 100 μl in each well, and then 100 μl of luciferase substrate (PerkinElmer, #6066769) was added to each well for the detection of luminescence using an Infinite M200 (TECAN). Relative luciferase units (RLU) were normalized to the corresponding DMEM control group, and the NT50 was determined by four-parameter nonlinear regression in Prism (GraphPad).
For the neutralization assay of circRNA nAB or circRNA ACE2 decoys , HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (50,000 cells/well) and incubated for approximately 24 hr until they reached over 90% confluence. The pseudoviruses were preincubated with the supernatant of the circRNA nAB- or circRNA ACE2 decoy - transfected cells at 37 °C for 60 min and then added to cells in 96-well plates. Media were changed 24 hr after transduction. All cells were collected 48 hr after transduction. Luciferase activity was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The relative luminescence units were normalized to cells infected with the supernatant of cells transfected with circRNA EGFP .
A549-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (20,000 cells/well) and incubated for approximately 24 hr until 90-100% confluence. The mouse serum was serially diluted 5-fold in DMEM, starting at 1:10. The diluted sera were then mixed with titrated virus in a 1:1 (vol/vol) ratio to generate a mixture containing ∼2,000 PFU/well of viruses (MOI = 0.1), followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 1 hr. Then, the virus/serum mixtures were added to 24-well plates of A549-ACE2 cells supplemented with 100 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS in each well. The supernatant and cell pellet precipitate were then collected, and the viral load was detected by RT–qPCR. Briefly, RNA was extracted from the cell pellet and reverse transcribed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification was performed by RT–qPCR targeting the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using a Roche LightCycler 96. The abundance of GAPDH was used as an internal reference. The NT50 was defined as the fold dilution that achieved inhibition of infection exceeding 50% of that of the control group.
The mouse model for the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant challenge has previously been characterized ( Montagutelli et al., 2021 55. Montagutelli, X. ∙ Prot, M. ∙ Levillayer, L. ... Variants with the N501Y mutation extend SARS-CoV-2 host range to mice, with contact transmission Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). BALB/c mice immunized with circRNA RBD-Beta (50 μg) were challenged with 5×10 4 PFU SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant at 7 weeks after the boost. The body weights of the mice were recorded daily. At 3 days after the challenge, the immunized mice were sacrificed, and their lung tissues were collected to measure the viral RNA load, as described below.
The viral RNA load in the lung tissues of challenged mice was detected by quantitative RT–qPCR. Briefly, the lung tissues were collected and homogenized with stainless steel beads in TRIZOL (1 ml for each sample). The RNAs in tissues were then extracted and reverse transcribed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification was performed by RT–qPCR targeting the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using a Roche LightCycler 96. The abundance of GAPDH was used as an internal reference. The placebo group viral load was normalized to 100%.
The splenocytes from each immunized mouse were cultured in R10 medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% Pen-Strep antibiotic, 10% HI-FBS) and stimulated with RBD peptide pools ( Table S4 ) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for each peptide. Three hours later, the Golgi Stop transport inhibitor cocktail (BD) was added according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, 6 hr later, cells from each group were pooled for stimulation with a cell stimulation cocktail (PMA/ionomycin) as a positive control. Following stimulation, the cells were washed with PBS prior to staining with LIVE/DEAD for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed in stain buffer (PBS supplemented with 2.5% FBS) and suspended in Fc Block for 5 min at RT prior to staining with a surface stain for the following antibodies: CD3 (Biolegend, #100229); CD4 (Biolegend, #100552); CD8 (Biolegend, #100714); CD44 (Biolegend, #103006); CD62L (Biolegend, #104445). After 20 min, the cells were washed with staining buffer and then fixed and permeabilized using a BD Cytoperm fixation/permeabilization solution kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed in perm/wash solution, followed by intracellular staining (30 min, RT) using a cocktail of the following antibodies: IFN-γ (Biolegend, #505810); IL-2 (Biolegend, #503818); IL-4 (Biolegend, #506324); TNF-α (Biolegend, #504104). Finally, the cells were washed in perm/wash solution and suspended in stain buffer. Samples were washed and acquired on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed using FlowJo software.
For the vaccination of rhesus macaques, groups of 2∼4-year-old male rhesus macaques were immunized with LNP-circRNA RBD (20 μg, n = 4; 100 μg, n = 4; 500 μg, n = 4), LNP-circRNA Ctrl (circRNA without the RBD-encoding sequence; 100 μg, n = 4) or PBS (n = 4) in 300 μl (>300 μl in 500 μg dose group) via intramuscular injection in the quadriceps muscle (prime: left, boost: right) twice at a three-week interval. The plasma of immunized rhesus macaques was collected at 0, 1 and 14 days after the prime and 0, 1, 14, 28 and 35 days after post-boost.
The T cell immune responses in rhesus macaques were detected using PBMCs with commercially available Monkey IFN-γ and IL-2 ELISpot assay kits (Mabtech) and an Monkey IL-4 ELISpot assay kit (U-CyTech). The cryopreserved rhesus macaque PBMCs were thawed and cultured with prewarmed AIM-V medium. For the IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-4 ELISpot assays, 1.0×10 5 PBMCs were stimulated with a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for each RBD peptide ( Table S5 ). The test for each rhesus macaque was performed in two or three technical repetitions. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) served as an unstimulating control, and phytohemagglutinin (PHA-P, Sigma) and CELL STIMULATION COCKTAIL (Thermo Fisher) were used as positive controls. After 24 h of stimulation with RBD peptide pools, the streptavidin-HRP substrate (for IFN-γ and IL-2) or AEC substrate (IL-4) was added to the plate. The spots were counted by Beijing Dakewei Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The results are background (DMSO treated group) subtracted and normalized to SFC/10 6 PBMCs.
At 5 weeks after the boost, all the immunized rhesus macaques were challenged with 1.0×10 6 PFU of native SARS-CoV-2 virus via the intranasal (0.5 ml) and intratracheal (0.5 ml) routes. The plasma of rhesus macaques was collected, and vital clinical signs were recorded at 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days post virus challenge. At 7 days post virus challenge, all rhesus macaques were sacrificed to collect specimens for further experiments.
At 7 days after the virus challenge, the rhesus monkeys were euthanized, and necropsies were performed according to standard protocols. After dissection, a general examination of the main organs was performed. The lung tissues were harvested, fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffer and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (2 μm) were prepared. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The slide images were collected by using Pannoramic DESK and analyzed with Caseviewer C. V 2.3 and Image-Pro Plus 6.0. Histopathological analysis of tissue slides was scored by 3 independent pathologists blinded to the groups of animals.
The plasma of rhesus monkeys was isolated 24 hr post-prime or boost and diluted 5-fold or 10-fold. All plasma samples were detected using the following ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions: IL-6 (Abcam, #ab242233), MCP-1 (Cloud-Clone Corp., #SEA087Si96T), TNF-α (Abcam, #ab252354), IL-1β (Cloud-clone Corp, #SEA563Si96T) and IFN-α (Chenglin, #AD0081Mk), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The unpaired two-sided Student’s t test or paired Student’s t test was performed for comparison as indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
