Title: Structure and Function of Stator Units of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor


Abstract: Summary

Many bacteria use the flagellum for locomotion and chemotaxis. Its bidirectional rotation is driven by a membrane-embedded motor, which uses energy from the transmembrane ion gradient to generate torque at the interface between stator units and rotor. The structural organization of the stator unit (MotAB), its conformational changes upon ion transport, and how these changes power rotation of the flagellum remain unknown. Here, we present ~3 Å-resolution cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of the stator unit in different functional states. We show that the stator unit consists of a dimer of MotB surrounded by a pentamer of MotA. Combining structural data with mutagenesis and functional studies, we identify key residues involved in torque generation and present a detailed mechanistic model for motor function and switching of rotational direction.

Section: Introduction

Numerous bacteria use rotating flagella to propel themselves ( Berg and Anderson, 1973 4. Berg, H.C. ∙ Anderson, R.A. Bacteria swim by rotating their flagellar filaments Nature. 1973; 245 :380-382 Crossref Scopus (687) PubMed Google Scholar ; Silverman and Simon, 1974 70. Silverman, M. ∙ Simon, M. Flagellar rotation and the mechanism of bacterial motility Nature. 1974; 249 :73-74 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ability to move is crucial for bacterial survival and pathogenicity ( Duan et al., 2013 22. Duan, Q. ∙ Zhou, M. ∙ Zhu, L. ... Flagella and bacterial pathogenicity J.

The role of the bacterial flagellum in adhesion and virulence Biology (Basel). 2013; 2 :1242-1267 Crossref Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ). The flagellum is made of a long external filament functioning as a propeller; a flexible linking structure, the hook; and a motor embedded in the cell envelope ( Berg, 2003 3. Berg, H.C.

Nakamura, S. ∙ Minamino, T. Flagella-driven motility of bacteria Biomolecules. 2019; 9 :279 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A). The ion-powered rotary motor consists of a rotor surrounded by a ring of stator protein complexes (MotAB) that power its rotation ( Coulton and Murray, 1978 18. Coulton, J.W. ∙ Murray, R.G.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174 :5123-5126 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The motor is bidirectional: chemotactic signaling can cause a conformational change in the rotor, known as “switching” ( Minamino et al., 2019 52. Minamino, T. ∙ Kinoshita, M. ∙ Namba, K. Directional Switching Mechanism of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor Comput. Struct. Biotechnol. J. 2019; 17 :1075-1081 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), which results in a change of the rotational direction of the motor.
Of note, the prokaryotic rotary motor stator unit family ( Lai et al., 2020 41. Lai, Y.-W. ∙ Ridone, P. ∙ Peralta, G. ... Evolution of the stator elements of rotary prokaryote motors J. Bacteriol. 2020; 202 :e00557 e19 PubMed Google Scholar ) of which MotAB is the best-studied example is apart from the rotary ATPase family the only known motor that uses energy from the transmembrane (TM) ion gradient instead of ATP to generate mechanical work ( Mandadapu et al., 2015 50. Mandadapu, K.K. ∙ Nirody, J.A. ∙ Berry, R.M. ... Mechanics of torque generation in the bacterial flagellar motor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E4381-E4389 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike the rotary ATPases, for which great structural insight has been obtained in recent years ( Kühlbrandt and Davies, 2016 40. Kühlbrandt, W. ∙ Davies, K.M. Rotary ATPases: A new twist to an ancient machine Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41 :106-116 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ), the mechanism of action of MotAB and stator units of other prokaryotic rotary motors remains poorly understood.
The stator units of the bacterial flagellar motor are embedded in the inner membrane, allowing interaction with the motor and the formation of an ion channel ( Coulton and Murray, 1978 18.

Overproduction of the MotA protein of Escherichia coli and estimation of its wild-type level J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170 :588-597 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). They are in a plugged, inactive state and get activated upon motor incorporation and peptidoglycan binding ( Hosking et al., 2006 31. Hosking, E.R. ∙ Vogt, C. ∙ Bakker, E.P. ... The Escherichia coli MotAB proton channel unplugged J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364 :921-937 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rotation of the rotor is powered by dispersion of an ion (generally H + or Na + ) motive force through the stator units ( Hirota and Imae, 1983 30. Hirota, N. ∙ Imae, Y. Na+-driven flagellar motors of an alkalophilic Bacillus strain YN-1 J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258 :10577-10581 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Larsen et al., 1974 43.

USA. 1974; 71 :1239-1243 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been proposed that ion binding by the stator unit induces a conformational change in the stator unit itself ( Kojima and Blair, 2001 37. Kojima, S. ∙ Blair, D.F. Conformational change in the stator of the bacterial flagellar motor Biochemistry. 2001; 40 :13041-13050 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). The stator unit protein MotA is thought to contact the FliG protein (through the torque helix (Helix Torque ) of the C-terminal domain FliG CC ), which forms part of the cytoplasmic C-ring of the rotor. In this way, the proposed conformational changes in the stator unit are driving rotation of the rotor ( Kojima and Blair, 2001 37. Kojima, S. ∙ Blair, D.F. Conformational change in the stator of the bacterial flagellar motor Biochemistry. 2001; 40 :13041-13050 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2010 44.

Minamino, T. ∙ Kinoshita, M. ∙ Namba, K. Directional Switching Mechanism of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor Comput. Struct. Biotechnol.

Electrostatic interactions between rotor and stator in the bacterial flagellar motor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :6436-6441 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). A large body of genetic data is available on mutations in the motor that affect movement and are characterized as Mot – (non-motile, i.e., deficient in motor rotation) or Che – (no chemotaxis, which can be caused by a deficiency in switching rotational direction) ( Yamaguchi et al., 1986 83. Yamaguchi, S. ∙ Fujita, H. ∙ Ishihara, A. ... Subdivision of flagellar genes of Salmonella typhimurium into regions responsible for assembly, rotation, and switching J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166 :187-193 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). All previously described mutations in the stator unit proteins are Mot – and not Che – . This indicates that switching of the rotational direction is caused solely by structural changes in the rotor. The same conformational changes in the stator unit that power rotation of the rotor in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction, must therefore also power rotation in the clockwise (CW) direction. Upon switching, it is thought that FliG CC makes a 180° turn relative to the stator unit, which allows the rotor to turn in the other direction ( Lee et al., 2010 44. Lee, L.K. ∙ Ginsburg, M.A. ∙ Crovace, C. ... Structure of the torque ring of the flagellar motor and the molecular basis for rotational switching Nature. 2010; 466 :996-1000 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The stator unit is a complex of two membrane proteins, MotA and MotB (for the H + -driven motor) ( Tang et al., 1996 79. Tang, H. ∙ Braun, T.F. ∙ Blair, D.F. Motility protein complexes in the bacterial flagellar motor J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261 :209-221 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). MotA contains four TM helices and a large cytoplasmic domain that is proposed to interact with the rotor ( Blair and Berg, 1991 6. Blair, D.F. ∙ Berg, H.C.

Biol. 1995; 251 :237-242 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). MotB contains a single TM helix followed by a large periplasmic domain, which can bind peptidoglycan ( Kojima et al., 2018 39. Kojima, S. ∙ Takao, M. ∙ Almira, G. ... The helix rearrangement in the periplasmic domain of the flagellar stator B subunit activates peptidoglycan binding and ion influx Structure. 2018; 26 :590-598 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roujeinikova, 2008 62.

USA. 2008; 105 :10348-10353 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MotB TM domain contains a universally conserved aspartate residue (D22 in Campylobacter jejuni , D33 in Salmonella enterica ), which is thought to be directly involved in proton transport ( Zhou et al., 1998b 89. Zhou, J. ∙ Sharp, L.L. ∙ Tang, H.L. ... Function of protonatable residues in the flagellar motor of Escherichia coli : a critical role for Asp 32 of MotB J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180 :2729-2735 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Directly following the MotB TM domain is a region known as the plug ( Hosking et al., 2006 31. Hosking, E.R. ∙ Vogt, C. ∙ Bakker, E.P. ... The Escherichia coli MotAB proton channel unplugged J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364 :921-937 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). Incorporation of the stator unit in the motor is coupled to the unplugging of the stator unit and peptidoglycan domain dimerization, allowing it to bind peptidoglycan. Crosslinking, biochemical, and genetic data for both MotAB and PomAB (a Na + -dependent stator unit) have allowed the identification of residues involved in complex formation and function ( Braun and Blair, 2001 8. Braun, T.F. ∙ Blair, D.F.

Tang, H. ∙ Braun, T.F. ∙ Blair, D.F. Motility protein complexes in the bacterial flagellar motor J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261 :209-221 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on these experiments, the stoichiometry of the MotAB stator unit has been suggested to be 4:2. However, this is based on the facts that MotB must at least be a dimer and that the MotA:MotB ratio is at least 2:1 ( Kojima and Blair, 2004 38. Kojima, S. ∙ Blair, D.F. Solubilization and purification of the MotA/MotB complex of Escherichia coli Biochemistry. 2004; 43 :26-34 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Bacteriol. 2011; 193 :3863-3870 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) and A quifex aeolicus MotA ( Takekawa et al., 2016 77. Takekawa, N. ∙ Terahara, N. ∙ Kato, T. ... The tetrameric MotA complex as the core of the flagellar motor stator from hyperthermophilic bacterium Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :31526 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been reported, but due to the limited resolution these do not provide information on stator unit stoichiometry or mechanism.
MotAB shows some sequence homology to energizing proteins of other systems, which have been proposed to be stator units of prokaryotic rotary motors ( Lai et al., 2020 41. Lai, Y.-W. ∙ Ridone, P. ∙ Peralta, G. ... Evolution of the stator elements of rotary prokaryote motors J. Bacteriol. 2020; 202 :e00557 e19 PubMed Google Scholar ) such as ExbBD ( Kojima and Blair, 2001 37. Kojima, S. ∙ Blair, D.F. Conformational change in the stator of the bacterial flagellar motor Biochemistry. 2001; 40 :13041-13050 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ), TolQR ( Cascales et al., 2001 11.

Motor-driven intracellular transport powers bacterial gliding motility Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :7559-7564 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). The stoichiometry of ExbBD was uncertain and different experiments reported 4:1, 4:2, 5:2, and 6:3 stoichiometries ( Celia et al., 2016 12. Celia, H. ∙ Noinaj, N. ∙ Zakharov, S.D. ...

Bacteriol. 2015; 197 :1873-1885 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a recent high-resolution structure of ExbBD shows a clear 5:2 stoichiometry ( Celia et al., 2019 13. Celia, H. ∙ Botos, I. ∙ Ni, X. ... Cryo-EM structure of the bacterial Ton motor subcomplex ExbB-ExbD provides information on structure and stoichiometry Commun. Biol. 2019; 358 Published online October 4, 2019 Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar ), which is consistent with the existence of ExbB pentamers in the native Escherichia coli membrane ( Chorev et al., 2018 17. Chorev, D.S. ∙ Baker, L.A. ∙ Wu, D. ... Protein assemblies ejected directly from native membranes yield complexes for mass spectrometry Science. 2018; 362 :829-834 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Despite great advances in the last decades concerning flagellar motor function, we still do not understand the structural and mechanistic basis of ion transport, channel (un)plugging, and torque generation. To help answer these questions, we determined ~3 Å cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of MotAB in different states, as well as lower-resolution structures of several other stator units. Our structures demonstrate a 5:2 stoichiometry for the stator unit complex MotAB, which we show is conserved across the MotAB/PomAB family, and reveal the structural basis of the autoinhibitory plugging of non-incorporated stator units. Furthermore, we infer the structural changes upon proton transport that are driving rotor rotation from the structures of different functional states and validate our structural results using extensive mutagenic analysis of the flagellar stator unit complex. Finally, based on our structural and functional results, we provide a detailed model for motor powering and rotational direction switching.

Section: Results

To obtain detailed insight into the mechanism of flagellar stator unit function, we tested the expression and purification of eight H + - and Na + -dependent stator units of seven different organisms ( Figure S1 ). Of the eight protein complexes, six could be purified after detergent solubilization. For three of these ( Figures 2 A and 2B), we obtained cryo-EM reconstructions, with the best resolution (3.1 Å) for C. jejuni MotAB ( Cj MotAB) ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). The maps obtained for Cj MotAB allowed building of an atomic model for the nearly complete MotA protein and for the TM helix and plug of MotB ( Figures 1 B–1F, S2 , S3 , S4 , and S5 ). Therefore, Cj MotAB was used as a model system to investigate the structural mechanism of the stator unit. We validated our structures using prior crosslinking, mutational, and tryptophan scanning data of the E. coli stator unit ( Figures S6 A–S6F). Structure determination of Shewanella oneidensis MotAB ( So MotAB) and V. alginolyticus PomAB ( Va PomAB) was complicated by preferential orientation of the protein in the ice but still allowed clear stoichiometry determination ( Figures 2 C–2K). We found that Cj MotAB forms a 5:2 complex, as do So MotAB and Va PomAB, suggesting that MotAB stoichiometry is conserved across all flagellar stator units. Furthermore, given the fact that the stoichiometry of ExbBD is identical ( Celia et al., 2019 13. Celia, H. ∙ Botos, I. ∙ Ni, X. ... Cryo-EM structure of the bacterial Ton motor subcomplex ExbB-ExbD provides information on structure and stoichiometry Commun. Biol. 2019; 358 Published online October 4, 2019 Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar ), it is likely to be a property of the whole family of stator units of prokaryotic rotary motors.
The flagellar stator unit has a truncated cone shape (widest at its cytoplasmic region) ( Figure 1 B; Video S1 ). Five copies of MotA cradle the single TM helices of the two copies of MotB. MotA TM helices 3 and 4 make direct interactions with MotB, and both these helices, which span the complete height of MotA, extend to the cytoplasmic domain.

Structural Organization of the Flagellar Stator unit Cj MotAB, Related to Figure 1 The movie begins showing the cryo-EM density map for the Cj MotAB stator unit in the micelle (gray), followed by color representation of the same map with and without the micelle, rotating around the vertical axis for visualization purposes. Finally, the atomic model is shown highlighting the 5:2 stoichiometry of the complex by rotating 90° around the horizontal axis to show first top (periplasmic side) and then bottom (cytoplasmic side) views. Color code is the same as in Figure 1.
The N-terminal part of MotA forms a parallelogram-like structure in the membrane. It consists of TM helix 1 (crossing from cytoplasm to periplasm), a linker including a 3 10 helix lying horizontally at the periplasmic side of the membrane (periplasmic interface helix), TM helix 2, crossing from periplasm to cytoplasm, and finally the cytoplasmic interface helix, which then connects to the large cytoplasmic domain. Both horizontal helices are very polar on their external sides, and the cytoplasmic interface helix is very basic at its cytoplasmic side ( Figures S7 A–S7D).
The cytoplasmic domain of MotA is made up of two stretches of amino acid chains (residues 69–142 and 211–258) ( Figure 1 D). The surface conservation is generally low with two clear exceptions: the MotB interface and a highly conserved region at the base (most distal from the membrane) of the cytoplasmic domain of MotA, which extends slightly to the exterior of that protein ( Figures 1 D–1F and S7 E–S7I). The latter region contains residues that have previously been shown to be important for torque generation ( Cj MotB R89 and E97, corresponding to R90 and E98 in E. coli / S. enterica ) ( Zhou and Blair, 1997 86. Zhou, J. ∙ Blair, D.F. Residues of the cytoplasmic domain of MotA essential for torque generation in the bacterial flagellar motor J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273 :428-439 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chromosomal point mutants of S. enterica MotA ( Se MotA) R90 and E98 displayed a pronounced defect in motility when the charge of these residues was inverted (R90E, R90D and E98R, E98K) or the R90 arginine residue was mutated to the smaller amino acid alanine ( Figure 3 ). The chromosomal point mutations of MotAB did not affect bacterial growth, suggesting that the observed motility defect was due to impaired motor function and not due to a general deficiency in cellular physiology, e.g., increased proton leakage. In support, charge reversal substitutions in these residues complement charge reversal mutants of oppositely charged residues in the FliG Helix Torque in E. coli ( Zhou et al., 1998a 88. Zhou, J. ∙ Lloyd, S.A. ∙ Blair, D.F. Electrostatic interactions between rotor and stator in the bacterial flagellar motor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :6436-6441 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we propose that this part of the structure contacts the rotor, and most likely FliG and its Helix Torque , during torque generation ( Figures S6 G and S6H).
The inside of the MotA cytoplasmic region is extremely acidic ( Figures S7 A–S7D). Possibly, this region might act as a reservoir for taking up charges that have passed through the stator unit and/or might interact with the N-terminal tail of MotB, which is visible in our maps but is less ordered than the MotB TM helix ( Figures S7 J–S7L), and which contains various basic residues ( Figure S1 ).
To reveal the active state of the stator unit and the structural basis of unplugging, we determined the 3.0 Å structure of unplugged stator unit Cj MotAB(Δ41-60) (which has a deletion of the 20 equivalent MotB residues shown to be important for plugging in E. coli [ Hosking et al., 2006 31.

(Un)plugging of the Flagellar Stator Unit, Related to Figure 4 Conformational changes of the atomic model of Cj MotAB along the process of (un)plugging. First, the plugged structure is presented, and the plugs are hidden for the next steps. This is followed by the visualization of the conformational changes upon unplugging and plugging on the overall structure of the stator unit. The view is then focused to show the conformational changes upon plugging and unplugging on the interface between MotA chain 1 and chain 2, showing residue F186 of MotA chain 1 (visualized in the unplugged structure in its position 2). Subsequently, with the complex in unplugged conformation, the flexibility of MotA chain1 F186 is shown by morphing the structures between position 1 and 2. The view is then rotated 180° around the vertical axis to visualize the F186 flexibility from the inside of the complex. Finally, the channel proposed on this study is shown, first by following its length along the inside of the complex and finally providing the whole view of it, showing the residues lining the channel. Color code is the same as in Figure 1.
In the full-length structure, MotA interacts with extensions (or plugs, one per MotB chain) immediately C-terminal of the MotB TM helix. Seen from the periplasmic side of the channel, the plugs have pseudo-mirror symmetry, resulting in extensive interaction between both plugs at the crossover point ( Figure 4 A). After a short coil structure (residues 40–44), both plugs form a helix, which lies in between MotA subunits, with three MotA subunits on one side and two on the other. Deletion of the plug region in E. coli and S. enterica MotB results in a massive influx of protons into the cytoplasm and inhibition of cell growth ( Hosking et al., 2006 31. Hosking, E.R. ∙ Vogt, C. ∙ Bakker, E.P. ... The Escherichia coli MotAB proton channel unplugged J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364 :921-937 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morimoto et al., 2010 54. Morimoto, Y.V. ∙ Che, Y.-S. ∙ Minamino, T. ... Proton-conductivity assay of plugged and unplugged MotA/B proton channel by cytoplasmic pHluorin expressed in Salmonella FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 :1268-1272 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ); therefore, the plug region is important to prevent proton leakage.
Comparing the structures of plugged and unplugged stator units, few conformational changes can be observed based on the lowest C α root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) superposition (0.714 Å) ( Figure 4 A). For the larger residues of Cj MotB, changes are limited to different conformations of Y20, D22, and F23 in chain 1. Looking at the universally conserved Cj MotB D22 residue, we note that one ( Cj MotB chain 1 D22) is mostly accessible (but pointing away) from the cytoplasmic interface (where we can observe solvent molecules), whereas the other ( Cj MotB chain 2 D22) is interacting with MotA and not accessible to solvent, both in the plugged and unplugged structures ( Figure 4 B). This suggests that Cj MotB chain 1 D22, but not Cj MotB chain 2 D22, would be protonatable and/or able to interact with hydronium.
The MotB TM helix and the internal MotB-interacting surface of MotA are highly conserved ( Figures S7 E–S7I). Their interaction surfaces are almost purely hydrophobic, the only polar or charged residues are Cj MotA T155 and T189 and Cj MotB Y20, D22, and S25. With the exception of the first of these, the corresponding Se MotAB residues ( Se MotA A174 and T210 and Se MotB Y31, D33, and T36) are also polar or charged ( Figures 3 E–3G). Of these, Cj MotA T189 and Cj MotB D22 are universally conserved and the polarity of Cj MotB S25 (which can be threonine in some stator units) is conserved as well ( Figure S1 ). Interestingly, all these residues lie at the height of the cytoplasm-proximal base of the MotB TM helix, or put differently, at or below the height of the inner membrane-periplasm interface. Using swimming motility assays, we show that in S. enterica , only Se MotB D33 ( Cj MotB D22) is absolutely required for motor function, but Se MotA T209A ( Cj MotA T189) also displays severely decreased motility (while not affecting growth) ( Figures 3 A–3D; Table S2 ).
These observations suggest that an access pathway must exist for protons and/or hydronium ions to MotB chain 1 D22 from the periplasm in the unplugged structure, but not in the plugged structure. Such a pathway appears to exist from the side of MotA between chains 1 and 2, just above the TM region. In the unplugged structure, but not in the plugged structure, MotA chain 1 F186 appears to adopt two alternate positions (positions 1 and 2), as can be clearly seen in the map ( Figures 4 H–4J). Position 1 is the same as in the plugged structure. Position 2, which appears to be the most occupied, overlaps with the location that in the plugged structure is taken up by a solvent molecule. This position is also in close proximity to MotB chain 1 S25 (and a solvent molecule that can be found near this residue in both structures), D22 and Y20 and MotA chain 1 T189. The polar residues outlined before appear to form a solvent-accessible channel ( Figures 4 D and 4E). The channel is lined with residues that have previously been shown to be important for ion transport ( Onoue et al., 2019 56. Onoue, Y. ∙ Iwaki, M. ∙ Shinobu, A. ... Essential ion binding residues for Na + flow in stator complex of the Vibrio flagellar motor Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :11216 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sudo et al., 2009 73. Sudo, Y. ∙ Terashima, H. ∙ Abe-Yoshizumi, R. ...

Terauchi, T. ∙ Terashima, H. ∙ Kojima, S. ...

Cj MotA F186 ( Se MotA M206) is universally conserved hydrophobic residue ( Figure S1 ). We found that mutations of Se MotA M206 to a small amino acid (M206A) or negatively charged amino acid (M206D) completely abrogated motility while not affecting growth ( Figures 3 A–3D; Table S2 ). This supports previous findings that M206 is involved in torque generation and proton translocation as well as pH-dependent stator assembly ( Suzuki et al., 2019 75. Suzuki, Y. ∙ Morimoto, Y.V. ∙ Oono, K. ... Effect of the MotA(M206I) Mutation on torque generation and stator assembly in the Salmonella H+-driven flagellar motor J. Bacteriol. 2019; 201 :19 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ). We conclude that Cj MotA F186 is a hydrophobic residue shielding the periplasm from the hydrophilic channel of MotAB. We propose that unplugging increases flexibility of Cj MotA F186, allowing the passage of protons or hydronium ions through the channel.
To gain insight into the conformational changes that Cj MotAB undergoes upon proton transport, we determined the 3.0 Å cryo-EM structure of stator units that combine the unplugging mutation Cj MotB(Δ41-60) with a Cj MotB(D22N) mutation, mimicking protonation or hydronium binding of D22 ( Figures 2 L, 2M, and S3 ). The structure of Cj MotAB(Δ41-60, D22N) is extremely similar to Cj MotAB(Δ41-60) when observing the lowest C α rmsd (0.297 Å) superposition, with one exception in MotB chain 1 (nomenclature based on structure alignment with lowest C α rmsd not taking into account large-scale rotational movement). N22 is clearly in a different position compared to D22, pointing down toward the cytoplasmic interface, where we can also distinguish several putative solvent molecules ( Figures 5 and S7 M–S7O; Video S3 ). We conclude that proton or hydronium binding or release by Cj MotB chain 1 D22 establishes a small conformational change in and around this residue, strongly suggesting that this residue is directly involved in the shuttling of protons or hydronium ions.

Effect of (Mimicking) Proton or Hydronium Binding to the Flagellar Stator Unit, Related to Figure 5 Conformational changes of the atomic model of Cj MotAB between deprotonated and protonated states. The deprotonated state is the Cj MotAB(Δ41-60) structure. The protonated state shown is the Cj MotAB(Δ41-60, N22) structure, but displaying MotB N22 as aspartate. The movie begins with the general view of the stator unit in its unplugged, deprotonated state. The structure then morphs back and forth between the deprotonated and protonated states (this is not expected to occur in reality, we use this movement for visualization purposes only). The deprotonated stator unit is then turned and focused on the MotB dimer. It can be appreciated how the MotB chain 1 D22 changes from pointing to the periplasm on the deprotonated state to pointing to the cytoplasm when protonated by morphing both states between them. The movie ends at the initial position. Color code is the same as in Figure 1.

Section: Discussion

Stator units power the rotation of the flagellar motor using energy derived from the ion motive force. As mentioned, the only motors harnessing ion motive force to generate work found in nature are the stator unit family of prokaryotic rotary motors (exemplified by MotAB) and rotary ATPases. Our analysis combined with a plethora of prior structural and functional data show that the stator units interact with the rotor through the cytoplasmic domains of MotA to provide torque.
Two mechanisms can be proposed for how torque is generated: a “rotational” model, where MotA rotates around MotB, and a “large conformational change” model, where MotAB changes between two conformations without rotation of MotA around MotB.
Our results are fully consistent with a rotational mechanism of the stator unit, rather than a large conformational change mechanism. The C α rmsd between Cj MotAB(Δ41-60) and Cj MotAB(Δ41-60, D22N) is 0.297 Å. It has been estimated that on the order of 37 ( Lo et al., 2013 46. Lo, C.-J. ∙ Sowa, Y. ∙ Pilizota, T. ... Mechanism and kinetics of a sodium-driven bacterial flagellar motor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :E2544-E2551 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) or 70 ( Blair, 2003 5. Blair, D.F. Flagellar movement driven by proton translocation FEBS Lett. 2003; 545 :86-95 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) ions are turned over per stator unit, per revolution of the rotor. From the geometry of the motor we calculate that the rotor needs to traverse an arc length of ~20–38 Å per ion. Consequently, the observed conformational changes are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated arc length traversed per ion passage. Rotations of 36° or 72° of MotA around MotB, however, would traverse arc lengths of 24 and 47 Å, respectively. Therefore, we propose that MotAB, and most likely all stator unit proteins of prokaryotic rotary motors, uses a rotational mechanism to perform work.
Given the structural similarity of both unplugged structures and the number of ions per stator and per rotor rotation, it follows that rotation of MotA around MotB will occur in steps of either 36° (so that after each rotary step, MotB chain 2 would be in a position equivalent, with respect to MotA, to where MotB chain 1 was before the rotation, and vice versa) or 72° (with MotB chain 1 and chain 2 in the same equivalent positions, with respect to MotA, which they had before the rotation). The first model (36° rotation) is more likely, as in this model the universally conserved aspartate residue of both chains would transport ions alternately, while this would not happen in the second model. Superposing the Cj MotAB(Δ41-60) and Cj MotAB(Δ41-60, D22N) structures in this way and making the natural assumption that the hydrophobic MotA interior can only rotate around charge-neutralized MotB D22 readily points to a model for how rotation occurs at the molecular level ( Figure 6 ; Videos S4 and S5 ). Note that charge neutralization by proton binding of a carboxylate group is also used in the Fo/Vo/Ao component of rotary ATPases, where protonation of an aspartate or glutamate residue on the c protein allows that residue’s entry into the hydrophobic interior of the lipid membrane and therefore rotation of the c-ring ( Kühlbrandt and Davies, 2016 40. Kühlbrandt, W. ∙ Davies, K.M. Rotary ATPases: A new twist to an ancient machine Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41 :106-116 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016 51. Mazhab-Jafari, M.T. ∙ Rohou, A. ∙ Schmidt, C. ... Atomic model for the membrane-embedded V O motor of a eukaryotic V-ATPase Nature. 2016; 539 :118-122 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protein geometry suggests a CW rotation (when observed from the extracellular/periplasmic side) of MotA around MotB: MotB chain 1 N22 is close to the equivalent position taken up by D22/N22 in MotB chain 2 (near T189), located CW.

Proposed Mechanism of Action of the Stator Unit Complex: Scheme, Related to Figures 6 and 7 This is an animated version of Figure 7, which shows a model for MotAB mechanism of action where rotation of MotA is caused by a power stroke upon protonation of MotB D22. First, MotB chain 1 D22 binds a proton (or hydronium, represented by a sphere with a + symbol) from the periplasmic side. Proton (or hydronium) binding neutralizes charge, which allows 36° rotation of MotA clockwise (CW) relative to MotB, by a power stroke involving MotB chain 2 D22. After rotation of MotA, MotB chain 2 D22 is accessible to the cytoplasm and releases its proton. After deprotonation, MotB chain 2 D22 gets in position and binds a new proton. As before, binding of this proton neutralizes charge, which allows another 36° rotation of MotA by a power stroke involving MotB chain 1 D22. MotB chain 1 D22 is now accessible to the cytoplasm and can release its proton. After deprotonation, MotB chain 1 D22 gets in position to accept a new proton, which is the same situation as in the beginning, but after a 72° rotation of MotA relative to MotB. In the movie, this process repeats until the stator unit is back in the starting position, after transport of 10 protons. Color code is the same as in Figure 1.

Proposed Mechanism of Action of the Stator Unit Complex: Modeling, Related to Figures 6 and 7 MotAB stator unit is first shown from the side view, from which it is rotated 90° around the horizontal axis to show the periplasmic view of the complex. Then, the model for the 36°-step turning of MotA pentamer around the MotB dimer is shown. Protonation of MotB chain 1 D22 (note that MotB chain 2 D22 is already protonated from a previous cycle) allows the power stroke produced by MotB chain 2, which gives place to a 36° rotation of the MotA pentamer. Consecutively, MotB chain 2 D22 is protonated, allowing the power stroke performed by MotB chain 1. The same process is shown in more detail with the slice of the complex at the level of the D22 residues of both MotB chains. MotB chain 2 D22 is engaged at MotA chain 2 (represented by a cyan halo). The incoming proton (or hydronium, represented by a sphere with a + symbol) from the cytoplasm, binds to MotB chain 1 D22, neutralizing the charge. This allows the 36° rotation of the MotA pentamer around MotB, given by the power stroke produced by MotB chain 2. Now, MotB chain 1 is engaged at MotA chain 5. At the same time, the proton interacting with MotB chain 2 is released to the cytoplasm. The model is followed by a change of roles between MotB chain 1 and 2. The same process is shown from the side, first as the whole complex and later as a sliced view highlighting the role of the D22 residue of both MotB chains. Finally, the view ends on the initial position. Color code is the same as in Figure 1.
The proposed mechanism is very akin to inchworm locomotion. Each MotB D22 alternately engages with MotA, in a site between Cj MotA T189, P154, and G150. When MotB D22 is engaged, it can drive a power stroke (when the charge of the other MotB D22 becomes neutralized). When it is not engaged, it picks up a proton from the channel and inches to the position where it can drive the power stroke. The mentioned MotA residues at the site of engagement are extensively conserved across all stator units of rotary prokaryote motors ( Baker and Postle, 2013 2. Baker, K.R. ∙ Postle, K. Mutations in Escherichia coli ExbB transmembrane domains identify scaffolding and signal transduction functions and exclude participation in a proton pathway J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195 :2898-2911 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the Va PomA T186A mutation abrogates motility as well as Na + -dependent structural changes in Va PomAB ( Onoue et al., 2019 56. Onoue, Y. ∙ Iwaki, M. ∙ Shinobu, A. ... Essential ion binding residues for Na + flow in stator complex of the Vibrio flagellar motor Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :11216 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the corresponding Se MotA T209A mutation has a severe motility defect ( Figures 3 A and 3B), as mentioned (both corresponding to Cj MotA T189).
In the following, we present a simple but comprehensive model integrating the data presented here, prior data, and previous models for stator unit activation, torque generation, and directional switching.
Before association with the rotor and peptidoglycan binding, MotAB is in the plugged state and the channel is closed. Association with the rotor and peptidoglycan binding is coupled to unplugging of the channel ( Figure 6 A). The cytoplasmic domains of MotAB incorporated in the motor are located such that (at least) one of them can interact with FliG Helix Torque ( Figure 6 B). Based on our structural data, genetic data ( Zhou et al., 1998a 88. Zhou, J. ∙ Lloyd, S.A. ∙ Blair, D.F. Electrostatic interactions between rotor and stator in the bacterial flagellar motor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :6436-6441 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our modeling of the FliG-MotA interaction ( Figures S6 G and S6H), FliG structural data ( Lee et al., 2010 44. Lee, L.K. ∙ Ginsburg, M.A. ∙ Crovace, C. ... Structure of the torque ring of the flagellar motor and the molecular basis for rotational switching Nature. 2010; 466 :996-1000 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ), and tomographic data on the Borrelia burgdorferi flagellar motor ( Chang et al., 2019 14. Chang, Y. ∙ Moon, K.H. ∙ Zhao, X. ... Structural insights into flagellar stator-rotor interactions eLife. 2019; 8 :147 Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar ), the rotor in the CCW state interacts with the inside (the side facing the motor axis) of the stator unit. Upon proton or hydronium binding and release by MotB D22, MotA rotates CW, relative to MotB, which in turn moves the rotor in CCW direction, as MotB is stably anchored to the peptidoglycan. Note that CW rotation of MotA is also predicted by our model outlined in the previous section ( Figure 7 ).
Upon CheY-P-induced directional switching, FliG CC (and therefore FliG Helix Torque ) makes a ~180° turn relatively to the stator unit ( Stock et al., 2012 72. Stock, D. ∙ Namba, K. ∙ Lee, L.K. Nanorotors and self-assembling macromolecular machines: the torque ring of the bacterial flagellar motor Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2012; 23 :545-554 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that the geometry of the stator unit rotor interface allows FliG Helix Torque to now engage the outside (the side facing away from the motor axis) of the MotA pentamer. The rotation of MotA relative to MotB is still the same (CW), but, because of the changed positioning of FliG, the same conformational change in MotA now powers rotation of the rotor in the CW direction ( Figure 6 B).
The model is consistent with the recently observed structural changes in the C-ring of CCW-biased and CW-locked mutants of V. alginolyticus ( Carroll et al., 2020 10. Carroll, B.L. ∙ Nishikino, T. ∙ Guo, W. ... The flagellar motor of Vibrio alginolyticus undergoes major structural remodeling during rotational switching bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ) and in the CCW- and CW-locked mutants of B. burgdorferi ( Chang et al., 2020 15. Chang, Y. ∙ Zhang, K. ∙ Carroll, B. ... Molecular mechanism for rotational switching of the bacterial flagellar motor bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ), where additionally the difference in stator engagement by the C-ring could be observed. Furthermore, the model predicts that the reversal of the ion motive force would invert the rotation direction of the stator unit and hence of the motor. This has previously been observed in E. coli ( Fung and Berg, 1995 25. Fung, D.C. ∙ Berg, H.C. Powering the flagellar motor of Escherichia coli with an external voltage source Nature. 1995; 375 :809-812 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ), lending experimental support to our model. Moreover, our model does not require any different conformational changes for the stator unit in powering rotation of the rotor in the CCW versus CW directions, consistent with the apparent lack of Che – mutations in MotA and MotB. According to our model ( Figure 7 ) and the geometry of the rotor and stator unit, binding and release of two protons (two 36° rotations) allows the stator unit to bind the neighboring FliG molecule, or a total of 68 protons per stator unit per rotation of the C-ring (assuming 34 FliG molecules per C-ring), in good agreement with previous estimates ( Blair, 2003 5. Blair, D.F. Flagellar movement driven by proton translocation FEBS Lett. 2003; 545 :86-95 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). The geometry, jointly with the proposed inchworm mechanism of the stator unit, is also consistent with the observed high duty ratio of the motor ( Ryu et al., 2000 63. Ryu, W.S. ∙ Berry, R.M. ∙ Berg, H.C. Torque-generating units of the flagellar motor of Escherichia coli have a high duty ratio Nature. 2000; 403 :444-447 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ), as the implied handover mechanisms allow that rotor and stator as well as MotA and MotB to remain firmly associated all the time.
In summary, we provide here fundamental insight into stator unit organization and a biophysical model of torque generation and switching of rotational direction of the flagellar motor. These results provide a structure-based framework for a profusion of experiments on stator units of prokaryote rotatory motors, the bacterial flagellar motor, and nanoscale motors in general.

Atomic coordinates for Cj MotAB, Cj MotAB(Δ41-60), and Cj MotAB(Δ41-60, D22N) were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes PDB: 6YKM , 6YKP , and 6YKR , respectively. The corresponding electrostatic potential maps were deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under accession codes EMDB: EMD-10828, EMD-10829, and EMD-10830, respectively. The electrostatic potential maps for So MotAB and Va PomAB were deposited in the EMDB under accession codes EMDB: EMD-10831 and EMD-10832, respectively.
E. coli Overexpress™ C43(DE3) used for protein purification was cultured in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) first at 37°C (growing phase) and later 30°C (protein expression). Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (wild-type and mutants) used for motility assays was grown in LB medium at 37°C. Swimming motility was determined using tryptone broth (TB)-based soft agar plates containing 0.3% agar, inoculated with the overnight cultures and incubated at 37°C.
The Cj MotAB fragment was amplified from Campylobacter jejuni (ATCC BAA-2151), So MotAB from Shewanella oneidensis (ATCC 700550) and Va PomAB from Vibrio alginolyticus (ATCC 17749). They were all cloned into a modified pET vector containing a C-terminal human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease cleavage site and a twin-Strep-tag II (resulting in pET11a-MotA-MotB-3C-TSII). All complexes were expressed in E. coli Overexpress™ C43(DE3) cells (LuBioScience GmbH) adapting published protocols ( Ma et al., 2013 48. Ma, P. ∙ Varela, F. ∙ Magoch, M. ... An efficient strategy for small-scale screening and production of archaeal membrane transport proteins in Escherichia coli PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e76913 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were cultured in 2 l LB medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) at 37°C and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at OD 600 0.4−0.8. Cells were incubated for another 3 hours at 30°C and then harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mL 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and incubated at room temperature for 20 min with shaking. To gently disrupt the cells, 24.3 mL of 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 1 M sucrose and 1 mM EDTA was added first, followed by addition of 330 μl 10 mg/ml lysozyme and 48 mL deionized water. After 20 min shaking at room temperature, spheroplasts were sedimented at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mL 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min while stirring. DNase I was added to improve pellet solubilization. Membranes were then sedimented at 18,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 5% glycerol and stored at −80°C.
Membranes were solubilized in 1% (w:v) Lauryl Maltose Neopentyl Glycol (LMNG) (Anatrace) for 2 hours shaking on a rocking platform and then ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g . The supernatant was added to a gravity flow column containing 2 mL of Strep beads (IBA), pre-equilibrated with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol and 0.005% LMNG). Beads were washed five times with 2 column volumes of wash buffer and elution was performed six times with 0.5 column volumes of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.005% LMNG and 10 mM desthiobiotin).
The protein complex was then loaded onto a Superose 6, XK 16/70 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), which was pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl and 0.002% LMNG. The peak fractions corresponding to the protein complex were concentrated to about 0.6 mg/ml using a centrifugal filter with a PES membrane (Sartorius) and used for preparation of cryo-EM sample grids.
3 μl of freshly purified sample was applied onto glow-discharged (30 s, 0.15 mbar) (Balzers Union dual chamber CTA 010 glow discharger) grids (Quantifoil R2/1 300 mesh Cu) and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The settings were as follows: 4°C, 100% humidity, 7 s wait time, 3 s blot time, and a blot force of 0. Movies were collected using the semi-automated acquisition program EPU (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Titan Krios G2 microscope operated at 300 keV paired with a Falcon 3EC direct electron detector (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were recorded in electron counting mode, at 96,000x magnification with a calibrated pixel size of 0.832 Å and underfocus range of 1 to 3 μm. Number of micrographs and total exposure values for the different datasets are summarized in Table S1 .
Image processing of the Cj MotAB, Cj MotAB(Δ41-60, D22N) and Va PomAB datasets was performed using RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 90. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :163 Crossref Scopus (2803) Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2 and S4) . Micrographs were aligned and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 85. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated using CTFFIND-4.1 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 61. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2721) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cj MotAB(Δ41-60) and So MotAB datasets were processed in cryoSPARC Live and cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 59. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3664) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively ( Figure S3 ). In this case, Patch motion correction and Patch CTF estimation were performed instead.
To make a 2D template for picking, a first particle picking job was done on a random subset of around 1,000 micrographs, using Laplacian-of-Gaussian picking (RELION) or blob picker (cryoSPARC Live and cryoSPARC). Selected 2D class averages were used as templates for reference-based automated particle picking from all the micrographs. Picked particles were extracted using a box size of 64 pixels (256 pixels binned 4 times). After an initial sorting and at least 4 rounds of 2D classification, selected particles were reextracted to a box size of 256 pixels and a 3D model was created de novo . This initial model was low-pass filtered to 60 Å and used in a 3D classification of the particles. The best class or classes were further processed in a 3D high-resolution refinement job. In cryoSPARC the map was sharpened during the same job using a dynamic mask, while in RELION mask creation and postprocessing jobs were performed to sharpen the maps by applying a B-factor corrected for the modulation transfer function of the detector. Finally, in RELION particles were further processed using per-particle CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing (including beam tilt estimation). Local resolution estimations were also obtained within RELION.
This general approach had to be modified for the So MotAB and Va PomAB datasets. Due to the preferential orientation So MotAB, further 3D classification jobs were performed, together with 2D classification jobs in order to keep as many side views as possible. In the case of Va PomAB, the initial model had to be generated with cisTEM ( Grant et al., 2018 27. Grant, T. ∙ Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. cis TEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing eLife. 2018; 7 :e35383 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Directional resolution anisotropy, which is caused by preferential orientation, was assessed using the Remote 3DFSC Processing Server ( Tan et al., 2017 78. Tan, Y.Z. ∙ Baldwin, P.R. ∙ Davis, J.H. ... Addressing preferred specimen orientation in single-particle cryo-EM through tilting Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :793-796 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( https://3dfsc.salk.edu/ ). The number of picked and final particles, map-sharpening B-factor and final map resolution values for all datasets can be found in Table S1 .
Global FSC curves shown in the figures have been corrected for the effects of masking ( Chen et al., 2013 16. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ).
De novo model building was performed manually using Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 23. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19617) PubMed Google Scholar ). Models were refined using PHENIX ( Liebschner et al., 2019 45. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3064) PubMed Google Scholar ) real space refinement. The geometry of the structures was validated using MolProbity ( Williams et al., 2018 81. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: More and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2131) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S1 ). Despite trying extensively, unlike for the Cj MotAB and Cj MotAB(Δ41-60, D22N) structures, it was impossible to fit a regular α-helix in the density around Cj MotAB(Δ41-60) MotB chain 1 D22 while respecting the chirality of this residue. The structure does fit very well to the map when introducing cis-peptides before and after this residue, which also point the carbonyl oxygen atoms to chemically plausible directions. We further validated the atomic model of Cj MotAB by plotting existing biological data obtained for E. coli MotAB from cross-linking experiments ( Braun et al., 2004 9. Braun, T.F. ∙ Al-Mawsawi, L.Q. ∙ Kojima, S. ... Arrangement of core membrane segments in the MotA/MotB proton-channel complex of Escherichia coli Biochemistry. 2004; 43 :35-45 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), mutational screening ( Blair and Berg, 1991 6. Blair, D.F. ∙ Berg, H.C. Mutations in the MotA protein of Escherichia coli reveal domains critical for proton conduction J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221 :1433-1442 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ; Blair et al., 1991 7. Blair, D.F. ∙ Kim, D.Y. ∙ Berg, H.C. Mutant MotB proteins in Escherichia coli J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173 :4049-4055 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) or tryptophan scanning analysis ( Sharp et al., 1995a 68. Sharp, L.L. ∙ Zhou, J. ∙ Blair, D.F. Features of MotA proton channel structure revealed by tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92 :7946-7950 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar , b 69. Sharp, L.L. ∙ Zhou, J. ∙ Blair, D.F. Tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis of MotB, an integral membrane protein essential for flagellar rotation in Escherichia coli Biochemistry. 1995; 34 :9166-9171 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) on the structure. Only residues above an alignment score cutoff of 2 (out of 11) for the alignment were plotted.
Se MotAB was modeled based on the structure of Cj MotAB with Modeler ( Sali and Blundell, 1993 65. Sali, A. ∙ Blundell, T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234 :779-815 Crossref Scopus (10933) PubMed Google Scholar ). The alignment ( Figure S1 ) between Cj MotA and Se MotA, and between Cj MotB and Se MotB, respectively, was provided to model the complete Se MotAB heteroheptamer. Non-conserved regions ( Se MotA 107-123 and 279-295) were removed for displaying.
C. jejuni FliG ( Cj FliG residues 115-334) was modeled based on the structure of H. pylori FliG MC1 ( Lam et al., 2012 42. Lam, K.-H. ∙ Ip, W.-S. ∙ Lam, Y.-W. ... Multiple conformations of the FliG C-terminal domain provide insight into flagellar motor switching Structure. 2012; 20 :315-325 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB: 3USW ). The FliG Helix Torque peptide ( Cj FliG residues 290-305) was extracted from this model for the following. Two subunits of MotA were extracted from the Cj MotAB atomic model generated in the present study and linked together from the C-terminal end of one to the N-terminal end of the other to allow submission to the FlexPepDock server ( London et al., 2011 47. London, N. ∙ Raveh, B. ∙ Cohen, E. ... Rosetta FlexPepDock web server--high resolution modeling of peptide-protein interactions Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 :W249-53 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raveh et al., 2010 60. Raveh, B. ∙ London, N. ∙ Schueler-Furman, O. Sub-angstrom modeling of complexes between flexible peptides and globular proteins Proteins. 2010; 78 :2029-2040 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ). The peptide was located in different positions, either on top of one MotA or in between two MotA subunits trying to maximize interaction between genetically interacting, oppositely charged residues (as described [ Zhou et al., 1998a 88. Zhou, J. ∙ Lloyd, S.A. ∙ Blair, D.F. Electrostatic interactions between rotor and stator in the bacterial flagellar motor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :6436-6441 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ]) and uploaded to the server. The best docking results, which corresponded to FliG Helix Torque interacting in between MotA monomers and also correlated with the electrostatic interaction data, were later manually readjusted in terms of rotamers, distances and position of the peptide. The process of submission and selection was repeated and the result with the best score (total: 5,981.675, rmsBB: 2.320) was chosen for plotting and analysis.
For calculation of a proton and hydronium accessible channel, the Cj MotAB(Δ41-60) model was analyzed using Mole 2.5 software ( Pravda et al., 2018 58. Pravda, L. ∙ Sehnal, D. ∙ Toušek, D. ... MOLEonline: a web-based tool for analyzing channels, tunnels and pores (2018 update) Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W368-W373 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). The bottleneck radius was set to 1 Å. The starting points for calculation were located along the interface between MotA chain 2 and 3, from the CI helix until the MotB chain 1, according to the mutagenesis data and the conformational changed observed in this study. In order to consider the flexibility of MotA chain 1 F186, the residue was ignored for the calculation. From the resulting channels, the one with best correlation to the biological data was selected.
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (J. Roth) (ATCC 700720) ( S. enterica ) is one of the best-studied model systems for the function of the bacterial flagellum and was therefore used for our motility experiments. The Se MotAB clean deletion (Δ motAB ) and Se MotA/MotB amino acid point mutants were generated in S . enterica LT2 using the λ-RED homologous recombination system ( Karlinsey, 2007 33. Karlinsey, J.E. lambda-Red genetic engineering in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium Methods Enzymol. 2007; 421 :199-209 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ; Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 19. Datsenko, K.A. ∙ Wanner, B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :6640-6645 Crossref Scopus (11855) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pET11a- Se MotA- Se MotB-3C-TSII (constructed as described for the constructs used for cryo-EM) or S. enterica genomic DNA as template. The use of chromosomal point mutants leaves the native promoter intact and modifies only the respective codons, expectedly resulting in similar expression levels to wild-type. All mutants have been sequenced. S . enterica strains were grown at 37°C in LB.
Swimming motility was determined using tryptone broth (TB)-based soft agar plates containing 0.3% agar. Plates were inoculated with 2 μl overnight cultures or using a pin tool (V&P Scientific) and incubated 3–4 hours at 37°C. Diameters of the motility swarm were measured using ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 67. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (42378) PubMed Google Scholar ) (NIH) and normalized to the wild-type.
S. enterica overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in 96-well plates and the OD 600 was measured in a microplate reader (Tecan) every 10 min for 8 hours with a brief shaking interval before each measurement. Growth rates were determined using GrowthRates 4.3 ( Hall et al., 2014 29. Hall, B.G. ∙ Acar, H. ∙ Nandipati, A. ... Growth rates made easy Mol. Biol. Evol. 2014; 31 :232-238 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ) with correlation coefficient R > 0.995.

M.S. cloned, expressed, purified, prepared all cryo-grids, collected cryo-EM data, and determined the structure of Cj MotAB (wild type and mutants), So MotAB, and Va PomAB. A.R.-E. helped M.S. with protein expression and purification and prepared figures and movies for the manuscript together with N.M.I.T. C.K. generated chromosomal Se MotAB mutants and performed and analyzed motility assays and growth curves. C.K. and M.E. interpreted motility and growth curve data and prepared figures for the manuscript. N.M.I.T. planned the experiments, refined and validated the structures, and wrote the first draft of the paper, which was then edited by M.E. and analyzed by N.W., H.C.B., and H.H. All authors contributed to the revision of the manuscript.
