Title: Intestinal mucin is a chaperone of multivalent copper


Abstract: Summary

Mucus protects the epithelial cells of the digestive and respiratory tracts from pathogens and other hazards. Progress in determining the molecular mechanisms of mucus barrier function has been limited by the lack of high-resolution structural information on mucins, the giant, secreted, gel-forming glycoproteins that are the major constituents of mucus. Here, we report how mucin structures we determined enabled the discovery of an unanticipated protective role of mucus: managing the toxic transition metal copper. Using two juxtaposed copper binding sites, one for Cu 2+ and the other for Cu 1+ , the intestinal mucin, MUC2, prevents copper toxicity by blocking futile redox cycling and the squandering of dietary antioxidants, while nevertheless permitting uptake of this important trace metal into cells. These findings emphasize the value of molecular structure in advancing mucosal biology, while introducing mucins, produced in massive quantities to guard extensive mucosal surfaces, as extracellular copper chaperones.

Section: Introduction

Giant mucin glycoproteins are secreted from cells to form protective mucus hydrogels covering the exposed surfaces of internal organs such as the lung and intestine ( McGuckin et al., 2011 26.

Soc. 2018; 15 :S210-S215 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). These hydrogels guard the underlying epithelium from pathogens and other hazardous matter entering from the outside world, while permitting nutrient absorption and gas exchange. Mucin gels store antimicrobial molecules that participate in innate immunity ( Hoffmann, 2021; Padra et al., 2019 14. Hoffmann, W.

Springer, Cham, 2019 179-207 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ). Mucin glycoproteins also house and feed the microbiome, lubricate tissue surfaces, and may facilitate the removal of contaminants and waste products from the body ( Paone and Cani, 2020 32. Paone, P. ∙ Cani, P.D. Mucus barrier, mucins and gut microbiota: the expected slimy partners? Gut. 2020; 69 :2232-2243 Crossref Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ). These numerous activities are enabled by the large sizes, dynamic conformations, post-translational modifications, and extensive intermolecular interactions of mucins. However, the same features that contribute to mucin functionality also complicate the study of these glycoproteins. Consequently, many questions remain regarding the mechanisms of mucin assembly, their physical and chemical capabilities, and their physiological contributions to the critical interfaces between animals and their environments.
Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we recently determined the structure of the amino-terminal region of the intestinal mucin, MUC2, in the context of a filament proposed to represent a bioassembly intermediate ( Javitt et al., 2020 18. Javitt, G. ∙ Khmelnitsky, L. ∙ Albert, L. ... Assembly Mechanism of Mucin and von Willebrand Factor Polymers Cell. 2020; 183 :717-729.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We noticed in the first von Willebrand factor type D (D1) region of this structure ( Figures 1 A and 1B) an intriguing congregation of histidine and methionine amino acids, including Met146, Met154, His277, His324, and Met326, arranged with the side chains pointing toward one another. Most of these amino acids are highly conserved in vertebrate MUC2 orthologs ( Figure 1 C). Inspection of human mucin paralogs revealed that the histidines are found in other gel-forming mucins (i.e., MUC5AC and MUC5B), but the methionines are largely restricted to MUC2 ( Figure 1 D). In the genetic code, histidine is represented by two codons and methionine by only one, so these amino acids could readily have been replaced in evolution if they were not under strong functional selection.
Histidines and methionines are common copper ligands in proteins ( Rubino and Franz, 2012 36. Rubino, J.T. ∙ Franz, K.J. Coordination chemistry of copper proteins: how nature handles a toxic cargo for essential function J. Inorg. Biochem. 2012; 107 :129-143 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). Copper is bound by proteins as a cofactor in a variety of important redox enzymes, to which it is delivered by dedicated transporters and chaperones in the circulation and in cells ( Rubino and Franz, 2012 36. Rubino, J.T. ∙ Franz, K.J. Coordination chemistry of copper proteins: how nature handles a toxic cargo for essential function J. Inorg. Biochem. 2012; 107 :129-143 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ; Linder, 2016 21. Linder, M.C.

Biol. 2019; 58 :26-33 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dysregulation of copper handling due to genetic mutations impairs vascular, hepatic, and immune functions, and deficiency or mis-localization of copper is associated with the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and other diseases ( DiNicolantonio et al., 2018 10. DiNicolantonio, J.J. ∙ Mangan, D. ∙ O’Keefe, J.H. Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease Open Heart. 2018; 5 , e000784 Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar ; Acevedo et al., 2019 1.

Despite the importance of copper use and regulation in the body, little is known about the initial encounter with dietary copper or about copper management at mucosal surfaces. This gap is largely due to the heterogeneity of mucosal environments and, as noted above, limited knowledge about the complex macromolecules that function there. Here, we present structural and biochemical evidence that mucins are copper-binding proteins. We show that the intestinal mucin uses distinct coordination sites to engage copper in multiple oxidation states, and we demonstrate the functional benefits of copper regulation by mucin.

Section: Results

To test whether MUC2 binds copper, the isolated D1 assembly was prepared, incubated with an equimolar amount of CuSO 4 , and crystallized ( Table S1 ). The X-ray crystal structure revealed a Cu 2+ binding site located at the interface of multiple subdomains near the protein surface ( Figures 2 A and S1 A). Though histidines are also prevalent in zinc binding sites ( Ireland and Martin, 2019 15. Ireland, S.M. ∙ Martin, A.C.R. ZincBind-- the database of zinc binding sites Database 2019. 2019; baz006 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ), no evidence of zinc was seen in D1 crystals grown in the presence of ZnCl 2 (data not shown). Microscale thermophoresis (MST) metal binding assays in solution supported a preference for Cu 2+ over a variety of nutrient and non-nutrient metals ( Figure S1 B), and Zn 2+ was a poor competitor for Cu 2+ binding ( Figure S1 C). MST could not provide an absolute measure of Cu 2+ affinity in this case because the dissociation constant was substantially below the protein concentration required for the measurements. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed tight Cu 2+ binding by D1, and measurements with glycine as a competitor yielded logK D values in the range of −12 or −13 depending on solution conditions ( Figure S1 D and Table S2 ).
Cu 2+ was coordinated in the MUC2 D1 crystal structure by three histidines and a glutamate ( Figure 2 B). In addition to His277 and His324, which drew closer together in the crystal structure compared to their positions in the cryo-EM cluster ( Figure 2 C), the amino-terminal region of D1 became ordered in the crystal, providing His34 for metal coordination. The highly conserved Glu156 ( Figure 1 C) completed the Cu 2+ coordination sphere. Though other proteins bind Cu 2+ with similar ligands, the MUC2 geometry is distinct ( Figure S2 ). The three histidines occupy approximately three sides of a square-planar coordination geometry, while the glutamate approaches at an angle of about 120° to the plane. The copper ligands were observed at 2.0 to 2.3 Å distance from the metal in the crystal structure model. The three methionines present in the cryo-EM cluster, Met146, Met154, and Met326, did not contribute to Cu 2+ binding in the D1 crystal structure and were positioned with their sulfur atoms about 6 Å away from the metal ( Figure 2 B). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of Cu 2+ -loaded MUC2 D1 was consistent with ligation to three multiple scattering histidine residues and one N/O ligand and provided more accurate distances of 2.018 and 1.886 Å for the histidines and glutamate, respectively ( Figures 2 D, S3 A, and Table S3 ).
Supporting the structural studies, Cu 2+ addition to MUC2 D1 increased the temperature midpoint of its thermal unfolding transition measured by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) ( Figures 2 E and S4 A). This phenomenon was particularly dependent on His277 and His324 but independent of the methionines ( Figure 2 E). Interestingly, His32, which had a disordered side chain that did not participate in Cu 2+ ligation in the crystal structure ( Figure 2 B), is highly conserved across vertebrates ( Figure 1 C) and invariant in a large-scale study of human genomic sequences (0 alternative alleles in a cohort of 76,156 genomes; gnomAD) ( Karczewski et al., 2020 16. Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Francioli, L.C. ∙ Tiao, G. ... The mutational constraint spectrum quantified from variation in 141, 456 humans Nature. 2020; 581 :434-443 Crossref Scopus (5288) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that mutations at this position are not tolerated and that this histidine plays a critical role in MUC2 function. Indeed, the effect on copper-induced thermal stabilization of mutating His32 was similar in magnitude to mutation of the Cu 2+ ligand His277 ( Figure 2 E). The impact of mutating His34, seen to bind Cu 2+ in the crystal ( Figure 2 B), was more moderate ( Figure 2 E). Nevertheless, His34 is also invariant in the human population study ( Karczewski et al., 2020 16. Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Francioli, L.C. ∙ Tiao, G. ... The mutational constraint spectrum quantified from variation in 141, 456 humans Nature. 2020; 581 :434-443 Crossref Scopus (5288) PubMed Google Scholar ), despite the appearance of an arginine at this position in the UniProt entry Q02817. As His32 and His34 are found in the flexible, amino-terminal segment of the protein, it is possible that either histidine can participate in copper ligation in a physiological context (i.e., outside a crystal lattice), or that a dynamic process of copper engagement utilizes both histidines.
Importantly, Cu 2+ increased the midpoint of thermal denaturation also for longer segments of MUC2 ( Figure S4 B). MUC2 can be cleaved proteolytically in vivo to yield the D1D2 segment ( Schütte et al., 2014 37. Schütte, A. ∙ Ermund, A. ∙ Becker-Pauly, C. ... Microbial-induced meprin β cleavage in MUC2 mucin and a functional CFTR channel are required to release anchored small intestinal mucus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :12396-12401 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ), as we also observed in the murine colon ( Figure S4 C) and in the supernatant of the LS174T MUC2-producing cell line ( Figure S4 D). Cu 2+ binding is therefore displayed by a physiological MUC2 fragment as well as by the full ∼1250 amino acid, multiple D-assembly portion at the amino terminus of MUC2 ( Figure 1 A).
In light of the conservation of the histidines and glutamic acid in other major gel-forming mucins ( Figure 1 D), we hypothesized that these mucins also coordinate Cu 2+ . Supporting this hypothesis, D1 of the murine MUC5B ortholog (denoted Muc5b), a representative respiratory mucin, showed increased thermal stability in the presence of Cu 2+ as measured by DSF ( Figure S4 E). MST confirmed Muc5b Cu 2+ -binding activity ( Figure S4 F).
Though the MUC2 D1 methionines did not engage in Cu 2+ coordination ( Figure 2 B), the proximity of these conserved amino acids to the Cu 2+ binding site could not be overlooked. Methionines often participate in Cu 1+ binding ( Rubino and Franz, 2012 36. Rubino, J.T. ∙ Franz, K.J. Coordination chemistry of copper proteins: how nature handles a toxic cargo for essential function J. Inorg. Biochem. 2012; 107 :129-143 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to the hypothesis that MUC2 has distinct sites for Cu 2+ and Cu 1+ . We found that Cu 2+ bound by D1 was reduced to Cu 1+ by ascorbate (vitamin C) and by the dietary flavonoid quercetin ( Figure 3 A). This observation inspired the addition of ascorbate to the Cu 2+ -bound MUC2 D1 crystals. Diffraction data collected from these crystals revealed a strong peak of electron density between the methionines, whereas the density corresponding to the histidine-dominated Cu 2+ site had disappeared ( Figure 3 B). The resolution of the diffraction data from the ascorbate-treated crystals was not sufficient to precisely measure sulfur-copper distances, but EXAFS of MUC2 D1 in solution confirmed Cu 1+ binding and provided structural information on the Cu 1+ coordination environment. Upon treatment of Cu 2+ -bound MUC2 D1 with ascorbate, the ligation changed dramatically from three-His, one-N/O to three sulfur ligands with an average Cu–S distance of 2.317 Å ( Figure S3 B and Table S3 ), which agrees well with data on other methionine Cu 1+ protein systems ( Chacón et al., 2014 7. Chacón, K.N. ∙ Mealman, T.D. ∙ McEvoy, M.M. ... Tracking metal ions through a Cu/Ag efflux pump assigns the functional roles of the periplasmic proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :15373-15378 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martin-Diaconescu et al., 2016 25. Martin-Diaconescu, V. ∙ Chacón, K.N. ∙ Delgado-Jaime, M.U. ... Kβ Valence to core X-ray emission studies of Cu(I) binding proteins with mixed methionine-histidine coordination. Relevance to the reactivity of the M- and H-sites of peptidylglycine monooxygenase Inorg. Chem. 2016; 55 :3431-3439 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). These changes in coordination environment and redox state were also indicated by the differences in the copper edges of the raw X-ray absorption data ( Figure 3 C).
Mutagenesis further supported the importance of the methionines in Cu 1+ binding. Cu 1+ increased the thermal unfolding transition temperature for MUC2 D1 and longer MUC2 segments to about half the extent as Cu 2+ , and its effect was entirely undermined by mutating Met146, Met154, or Met326 ( Figures 3 D and S4 E). Furthermore, mutation of methionines lowered the affinity for Cu 1+ , from a logK D of −14 to −12 or below, as measured by competitive titrations ( Figure S5 ). A MUC2 D1 variant with all three methionines mutated to leucine or valine (M146L/M154L/M326V) gave a logK D of −13 ( Figure S5 ), in accordance with some thermal stabilization of this variant by Cu 1+ ( Figure 3 D). It is possible that the triple mutant binds Cu 1+ with the aid of some of the histidines when the Cu 1+ site is eliminated. However, Muc5b, which naturally lacks the methionines but contains the histidines, was not stabilized by Cu 1+ ( Figure S4 E). Together, the experiments described thus far provide structural and biochemical evidence for a two-tiered copper binding environment in MUC2, in which histidines dominate the Cu 2+ coordination and nearby methionines capture Cu 1+ .
Copper catalyzes the consumption of oxygen and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) while depleting available antioxidants ( Buettner and Jurkiewicz, 1996 6. Buettner, G.R. ∙ Jurkiewicz, B.A. Catalytic metals, ascorbate and free radicals: combinations to avoid Radiat. Res. 1996; 145 :532 Crossref Scopus (807) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore the effect of MUC2 on copper-mediated electron transfer, we followed the oxidation of ascorbate in aerobic copper-containing solutions by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 265 nm ( Figure 4 A). Although Cu 2+ bound to MUC2 D1 was reduced by ascorbate ( Figure 3 A), the bound copper did not undergo futile cycling in the transfer of electrons from ascorbate to oxygen ( Figure 4 B). Mutation of MUC2 copper ligands compromised the suppression of redox cycling, and Muc5b D1, which lacks a Cu 1+ binding site, was less effective than MUC2 D1 ( Figure 4 B). Longer MUC2 segments prevented the redox cycling of copper as effectively as the D1 assembly alone ( Figure 4 C). These results indicate that MUC2 D1 stabilizes Cu 1+ in the presence of oxygen in a manner that prevents accumulation of ROS.
Based on this finding, we hypothesized that MUC2 might protect intestinal cells from toxic copper concentrations. E-cadherin labeling of Caco-2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, which do not express significant MUC2 ( van Klinken et al., 1996 43. van Klinken, B.J.W. ∙ Oussoren, E. ∙ Weenink, J.J. ... The human intestinal cell lines Caco-2 and LS174T as models to study cell-type specific mucin expression Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13 :757-768 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), was used to report on the integrity of cell-cell contact sites and the health of the monolayer. Addition of 250 μM Cu 2+ in serum-free medium resulted in dramatic loss of the organized networks of E-cadherin seen in control cultures ( Figure 4 D). Supplying 250 μM MUC2 D1 together with 250 μM Cu 2+ almost completely reversed this phenomenon, but a D1 mutant with perturbed copper binding sites, H324A/M326V, was unable to protect ( Figure 4 D).
The ability of MUC2 D1 to neutralize the toxicity of excess copper led us to ask whether D1 completely sequesters extracellular copper, or rather permits copper uptake for beneficial physiological processes. To address this question, we investigated whether nutritional levels of copper, i.e., sufficient copper to maintain basic cellular metabolic functions, supplied with D1 can be taken up by copper-starved cells. Caco-2 cells were deprived of copper by growth in the presence of the Cu 1+ chelator bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) until a severe drop was seen in the level of the mitochondrial electron transport chain component cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1), which requires copper for function ( Getz et al., 2011 13. Getz, J. ∙ Lin, D. ∙ Medeiros, D.M. The cardiac copper chaperone proteins Sco1 and CCS are up-regulated, but Cox1 and Cox4 are down-regulated, by copper deficiency Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 2011; 143 :368-377 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Limited amounts of copper, 0.1 or 1 μM, were then re-supplied as Cu 2+ , either alone or in the presence of stoichiometric or excess MUC2 D1, and the recovery of COX1 levels was monitored. Recovery proceeded even with a 5-fold excess of D1 over copper, in a concentration range substantially over the dissociation constant, suggesting that D1 can release needed copper to cells ( Figures 5 A and S6 ). It should be noted that Cu 2+ added to the medium may become reduced to Cu 1+ , consistent with the efficacy of the Cu 1+ chelator BCS in inducing copper starvation. Hinting at a mechanism for Cu 1+ transfer, the Cu 1+ ligands in MUC2 D1, though buried within the protein, are adjacent to a small interior tunnel with two portals at the protein surface ( Figure 5 B). Together these findings show that MUC2 guards cells from the toxicity of excess copper without blocking supply of the low levels of copper required to maintain physiological processes.

Section: Discussion

Mucins are multifunctional molecules that promote mucosal health by restricting access of pathogens to the epithelial cell surface, storing factors that participate in innate immunity, and managing the microbiome ( McGuckin et al., 2011 26.

Bankole, E. ∙ Read, E. ∙ Curtis, M.A. ... The relationship between mucins and ulcerative colitis: a systematic review J. Clin. Med. 2021; 10 :1935 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, secreted mucins were hypothesized to act not only as a protective barrier but also as regulators of small molecule access to membrane-embedded receptors and transporters ( Strous and Dekker, 1992 39. Strous, G.J. ∙ Dekker, J. Mucin-type glycoproteins Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27 :57-92 Crossref Scopus (797) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, investigating the molecular mechanisms of mucin function has long been limited by the lack of high-resolution mucin structures. Remarkably, a specific role for mucins in managing copper was revealed when structural information became available to inspire and inform the experiments reported in this work.
The studies presented here show that mucin D1 assemblies are specific for copper over a variety of other metals tested. Weak binding to zinc was also detected, but copper out-competed zinc for binding to MUC2 D1, even when zinc was present in great molar excess ( Figure S1 C). The specialization of the mucin D1 assembly for copper binding contrasts with a separate, conserved calcium binding site present in all three D assemblies in the amino-terminal region of MUC2 ( Javitt et al., 2020 18. Javitt, G. ∙ Khmelnitsky, L. ∙ Albert, L. ... Assembly Mechanism of Mucin and von Willebrand Factor Polymers Cell. 2020; 183 :717-729.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in the related blood clotting glycoprotein von Willebrand factor ( Dong et al., 2019 11.

Biol. 2019; 431 :3740-3752 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), the Cu 2+ -bound MUC2 D1 structure lacked calcium, probably due to the crystallization conditions. However, it is likely that calcium was bound to the purified MUC2 D1 in solution, as Ca 2+ addition alone had no effect on the protein in MST ( Figure S1 B) or DSF ( Figure S4 A) experiments. Cu 2+ addition, in contrast, showed a strong effect on thermophoresis and thermal stability in these experiments, indicating that the purified protein was in the apo state for this element. In particular, a single thermal unfolding transition was found for MUC2 D1 without addition of Cu 2+ ( Figure S4 A), which shifted completely to a higher temperature in the presence of Cu 2+ , providing support for the homogeneity of the protein prior to and following stoichiometric Cu 2+ addition.
In contrast to Ca 2+ , which is bound locally within the VWD domains of the D assemblies, Cu 2+ is bound at the interface between three separate domains in D1: VWD1, C8-1, and TIL-1 ( Figure 2 A). One Cu 2+ ligand is provided by each of these domains, and the fourth ligand is supplied by the flexible region at the amino terminus of the protein, just upstream of the VWD1 domain ( Figure 2 B). The distinct Cu 2+ coordination geometry of MUC2 D1 compared to other copper-binding proteins with similar ligands ( Figure S2 ) may reflect the independent evolutionary origin of copper binding by mucins, as well as mechanistic requirements for transfer of the bound Cu 2+ to the Cu 1+ site upon reduction. At the Cu 1+ site, the amino terminus and C8-1 do not participate, and the Cu 1+ ligands are provided by the VWD1 and TIL-1 domains. The binding of copper between multiple domains suggests that affinity for copper is tunable by factors or events, such as supramolecular assembly ( Javitt et al., 2020 18. Javitt, G. ∙ Khmelnitsky, L. ∙ Albert, L. ... Assembly Mechanism of Mucin and von Willebrand Factor Polymers Cell. 2020; 183 :717-729.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) or interactions with other proteins, that may affect the relative orientations of those domains. Indeed, the TIL-1 and E-1 domains are flexible relative to the VWD1 and C8-1 domains, affecting the availability of the key copper ligand H324 ( Figure 2 C). Thus, in addition to the potential exit of Cu 1+ through the portals seen in the MUC2 D1 crystal structure ( Figure 5 B), copper in either oxidation state may in principle be released by changes in the relative orientations of the domains constituting the D1 assembly. The conformational changes that mucins undergo during trafficking, storage, secretion, and extracellular function can now be studied with an eye toward their effect on copper coordination and release.
With detailed structural and biochemical information available, a physiological role for copper binding by mucins can be considered. Just as mucins themselves have many functions, copper binding by mucins may serve various purposes. MUC2 is expressed at high levels in all parts of the intestine, including both aerobic and anaerobic environments and regions with different digestive, absorptive, and excretive roles ( Audie et al., 1993 3. Audie, J.P. ∙ Janin, A. ∙ Porchet, N. ... Expression of human mucin genes in respiratory, digestive, and reproductive tracts ascertained by in situ hybridization J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41 :1479-1485 Crossref Scopus (420) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paone and Cani, 2020 32. Paone, P. ∙ Cani, P.D. Mucus barrier, mucins and gut microbiota: the expected slimy partners? Gut. 2020; 69 :2232-2243 Crossref Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to protecting the intestines and other mucosal surfaces against copper toxicity, copper binding by mucins may facilitate the conversion of dietary copper (largely Cu 2+ ) to the form transported across the enterocyte membrane (thought to be Cu 1+ ). Notably, the high citrate concentration in the crystallization buffer did not prevent copper binding by MUC2 D1, indicating that the mucin competes well with organic acids that solubilize copper in the diet ( Wapnir, 1998 44. Wapnir, R.A. Copper absorption and bioavailability Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67 :1054S-1060S Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mechanisms by which dietary copper passes from the lumen of the digestive tract into enterocytes are debated ( Zimnicka et al., 2007 47. Zimnicka, A.M. ∙ Maryon, E.B. ∙ Kaplan, J.H.

Hypothetically, MUC2 may interface structurally or functionally with the transmembrane copper transporter Ctr1, which uses methionines to coordinate Cu 1+ in its pore ( Ren et al., 2019 34.

Ctr1 drives intestinal copper absorption and is essential for growth, iron metabolism, and neonatal cardiac function Cell Metab. 2006; 4 :235-244 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mucins may also regulate copper delivery to commensal microorganisms or participate in nutritional immunity ( Lopez and Skaar, 2018 23. Lopez, C.A. ∙ Skaar, E.P. The impact of dietary transition metals on host-bacterial interactions Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :737-748 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ) by depriving pathogens of copper. MUC2 may cooperate with bile ( Linder, 2020 22. Linder, M.C. Copper Homeostasis in Mammals, with Emphasis on Secretion and Excretion. A Review Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :4932 Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar ) for the safe excretion of excess copper. These activities need not be mutually exclusive. Further exploration of these various possibilities will help integrate mucins into models of physiological copper management ( Shanbhag et al., 2021 38. Shanbhag, V.C. ∙ Gudekar, N. ∙ Jasmer, K. ... Copper metabolism as a unique vulnerability in cancer Biochim. Biophy. Acta Mol. Cell. Res. 2021; 1868 , 118893 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It is well known that copper is carefully regulated in biology. Transfer of copper within eukaryotic cells and in the bacterial periplasm is done by direct protein-protein contacts and ligand exchange rather than by release of copper into solution ( Robinson and Winge, 2010 35. Robinson, N.J. ∙ Winge, D.R. Copper metallochaperones Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79 :537-562 Crossref Scopus (609) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nevitt et al., 2012 27.

The players and mechanisms of copper chaperoning inside cells and in blood are relatively well understood ( Nevitt et al., 2012 27. Nevitt, T. ∙ Ohrvik, H. ∙ Thiele, D.J. Charting the travels of copper in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823 :1580-1593 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ; Linder, 2016 21. Linder, M.C.

Biol. 2019; 58 :26-33 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), but how the body manages copper before it reaches those sites has been obscure. To date, one small gastrointestinal mucosal protein, TFF1, has been reported to bind copper using a flexible carboxy-terminal tail containing a cysteine and acidic residues ( Tosco et al., 2010 40. Tosco, A. ∙ Monti, M.C. ∙ Fontanella, B. ... Copper binds the carboxy-terminus of trefoil protein 1 (TFF1), favoring its homodimerization and motogenic activity Cell. Mol. Life Sci . 2010; 67 :1943-1955 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), but structural information on the binding mode is lacking. The lung and gastrointestinal mucosa are the largest, most important, and most vulnerable of exposed physiological surfaces, so it is reasonable that mechanisms would have evolved for restraining an essential but toxic element in these environments. The discovery that multiple gel-forming mucins are copper binding proteins, with an elaborate two-tiered site for distinct copper oxidation states in intestinal mucin ( Figure 6 ), introduces intriguing new players into the field of copper regulation and utilization in the human body.
Our data clearly establish that conserved clusters of amino acids in gel-forming mucins preferentially bind copper and that the intestinal mucin MUC2 has a two-tiered site for binding of multiple copper oxidation states. The conservation of the copper-coordinating amino acids across animal species and the lack of variability in the human population suggest functional importance, but the physiological roles for copper binding by mucins remain to be established. Results presented here are consistent with several possibilities, including preventing the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species by blocking futile redox cycling. Moreover, MUC2 capturing of copper was shown not to interfere with copper uptake into cells, but a role in direct delivery of copper to cells is hypothetical at this point. A definitive demonstration of functional importance will require eliminating the MUC2 copper binding capability in a transgenic animal to determine the impact on copper metabolism and on commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. Additional mechanistic questions remain open, such as whether Cu 1+ and Cu 2+ can bind MUC2 simultaneously and what factors affect the kinetics of binding and release.

The primary plasmids used in this study were deposited to Addgene (identifiers: #181812, #181813, #181814, #187993, and #187994).
The human colon epithelial cell line Caco-2 were obtained from the laboratory of Prof. Benjamin Geiger (Weizmann Institute of Science) and grown in DMEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and Pen-Strep (Biological Industries). Caco-2 cells were confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma. The human colon epithelial cell line LS174T was purchased from Sigma and grown in MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and Pen-Strep (Biological Industries).
Wild-type strain C57BL mice, male, age 10 weeks, were obtained from a colony housed in the Weizmann Institute mice facility for experiments approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) of the Weizmann Institute of Science, approval number 01280121-2.
The MUC2 D1 coding sequence (NCBI reference sequence NP_002448.4, amino acids 21–389) was cloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector following the signal sequence of the enzyme QSOX1. A His 6 tag was appended to the carboxy terminus. The plasmid was transiently transfected into HEK293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the PEI Max reagent (Polysciences Inc.) with a 1:3 ratio (w/w) of DNA to PEI at a concentration of 1 million cells per mL. Cells were maintained in FreeStyle 293 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To facilitate subsequent crystallization, 5 μM kifunensine (Cayman Chemical) was added at the time of transfection to obtain protein containing high-mannose, EndoH-cleavable glycans. Six days after transfection, cells were removed from the cultures by centrifugation for 10 min at 500xg. The culture medium was then further clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 9500xg and filtration through a 0.45 μm pore-size membrane. The D1 assembly was purified from the medium by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chromatography. Purified protein was exchanged into 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and concentrated to 10 mg/mL (240 μM). Protein concentration was determined by diluting an aliquot with 6 M guanidinium chloride in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7 and measuring absorbance at 280 nm against a blank containing the same volumes of guanidinium solution and buffer solution lacking protein (ε 280nm for MUC2 D1 = 43,245 M −1 cm −1 ). EndoH (500 units) was added to 400 μL D1 and incubated overnight at room temperature before crystallization.
For experiments aside from crystallization, the MUC2 D1 expression construct was modified to contain a His 6 tag and tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site following the signal sequence, and the His 6 tag at the carboxy terminus was eliminated. Protein was produced without kifunensine. After Ni-NTA purification, protein was subjected to cleavage with TEV protease containing a His 6 tag. The cleaved amino terminal tag and the TEV protease were subsequently removed using Ni-NTA beads. The protein was concentrated in 10 mM 3-( N -morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl. Glycerol was added to 10%, and aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. An expression plasmid for Muc5b D1 (UniProt E9Q5I3 amino acids 50–426) was prepared with a TEV cleavage site followed by a His 6 tag at the carboxy terminus. Muc5b D1 was produced and purified as for MUC2 D1, subjected to TEV cleavage, and quantified as described above (ε 280nm for Muc5b D1 including the remaining segment of the TEV site = 50,360 M −1 cm −1 ). Longer constructs of MUC2, namely D1D2D′ (amino acids 21–858) and D1D2D′D3 (amino acids 21–1259), were produced and purified as for MUC2 D1, subjected to TEV cleavage, and quantified as described above (ε 280nm for MUC2 D1D2D′ = 102,710 M −1 cm −1 and for MUC2 D1D2D′D3 = 167,760 M −1 cm −1 ).
The MUC2 D1 assembly containing a carboxy-terminal His 6 tag was crystallized using the hanging drop method over a well solution containing 30 mM MgCl 2 , 8% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mM citrate buffer, pH 5.4, and 10% glycerol. The protein stock solution for crystallization was supplemented with 480 μM copper sulfate. Drops were prepared by mixing 2 μL protein with 1 μL well solution. Data-quality crystals grew slowly over the course of a few months. About 10 min prior to flash freezing, crystals were transferred to a solution containing all components of the well except that the glycerol concentration was increased to 20%. For reduction of Cu 2+ , 5 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma) was included in this soak solution. Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline ID23-1 at 100 K. The wavelength was 14.2 keV (0.8731 Å). Initial phases were provided by molecular replacement using the D1 assembly from the MUC2 amino-terminus cryo-EM structure ( Javitt et al., 2020 18. Javitt, G. ∙ Khmelnitsky, L. ∙ Albert, L. ... Assembly Mechanism of Mucin and von Willebrand Factor Polymers Cell. 2020; 183 :717-729.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the structure model was improved by cycles of rebuilding using Coot ( Elmsley et al., 2010 12. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refinement using Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). No Ramachandran outliers were present in the refined structure model, and 95.5% of the amino acids were in favored regions of Ramachandran space. Though the D1 assembly was previously seen to bind calcium in the cryo-EM structure ( Javitt et al., 2020 18. Javitt, G. ∙ Khmelnitsky, L. ∙ Albert, L. ... Assembly Mechanism of Mucin and von Willebrand Factor Polymers Cell. 2020; 183 :717-729.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), no calcium was detected in the D1 crystal structure, most likely due to the high concentration of citrate in the crystallization buffer.
The use of glycine as a competitor for copper to enable accurate ITC measurements of high-affinity protein-copper interaction was based on published studies ( Trapaidze et al., 2012 42. Trapaidze, A. ∙ Hureau, C. ∙ Bal, W. ... Thermodynamic study of Cu 2+ binding to the DAHK and GHK peptides by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with the weaker competitor glycine J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2012; 17 :37-47 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). MUC2 D1 was dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl and 2, 10, or 30 mM glycine, or against HEPES buffer, pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl, and 4 mM glycine. After dialysis, protein was diluted to a final concentration of 50 μM. CuSO 4 was prepared at 500 μM in the same dialysis buffer as the corresponding protein. Experiments were conducted at 25°C on a Malvern Micro-Cal PEAQ-ITC system starting with a single 0.4 μL injection of Cu 2+ solution into protein solution, followed by 18 2-μL injections, with 150 s spacing between each injection and continuous stirring at 750 rpm. For each glycine concentration, a blank run titrating the Cu 2+ into buffer was done and subtracted accordingly. The titration data were analyzed using software provided by the manufacturer to obtain the apparent K D and other parameters. Conditional K D values were derived according to published methods ( Trapaidze et al., 2012 42. Trapaidze, A. ∙ Hureau, C. ∙ Bal, W. ... Thermodynamic study of Cu 2+ binding to the DAHK and GHK peptides by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with the weaker competitor glycine J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2012; 17 :37-47 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the set of measurements performed at pH 7.4, substoichiometric Cu 2+ binding was observed, with Cu 2+ :protein ratios of ∼0.54:1. Measurements subsequently performed at pH 6.8 yielded Cu 2+ :protein ratios of ∼0.85:1. (Table 2). The reason for deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio is as yet unexplained. X-ray fluorescence counts at the copper edge showed that purified MUC2 D1 was not pre-loaded with Cu 2+ , and measurements after addition of Cu 2+ suggested stoichiometric binding. None of the other experiments performed ( i.e ., crystallography, BCA colorimetric assays, or DSF) suggested either a fraction of copper pre-loaded protein or copper binding-incompetent protein. Protein concentrations were determined for ITC and EXAFS experiments using the same method and were done with care, such that it is unlikely that large errors in protein concentration determination explain the ITC results.
To compare thermal stabilization upon Cu binding by WT MUC2 segments and mutants, as well as by Muc5b, DSF was performed using a Prometheus NT.48 (NanoTemper) instrument. Proteins were used at a concentration of 5, 7.5, or 12 μM, as indicated in the figure legends. All metals were supplied at a 1:1 M ratio to protein. When present, ascorbic acid was added at a 20:1 M ratio to protein. Buffer was either 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH 5.7, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 or 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. Metals were supplied as: Cu, copper sulfate; Zn, zinc chloride; Ca, calcium chloride; Co, cobalt chloride; Ni, nickel sulfate; Fe, iron sulfate; Mn, manganese chloride; Hg, mercury chloride; Cd, cadmium acetate, Pb, lead chloride; As, sodium arsenite. Samples were heated from 25°C to 95°C at 1°C/min. Tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence was monitored by recording the 350/330 nm emission ratio after excitation at 280 nm.
MUC2 D1 was used at a concentration of 500 nM in 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. Protein was incubated with 16 serial dilutions of metal in the range of 50 μM to 1.5 nM for 10 min and centrifuged at 20,000xg for 10 min at 4°C. Tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence was monitored and recorded using a Monolith Label-Free instrument (NanoTemper). Thermophoresis was analyzed at 70% LED and 20% infrared laser intensity for all samples. Initial fluorescence was equal in all capillaries before thermophoresis measurements. MST to analyze copper binding by Muc5b was performed in the same manner.
A solution of 800 μM MUC2 D1 in 50 mM MES buffer, pH 5.7, 100 mM NaCl was incubated with 0.8:1 equiv of CuSO 4 via syringe pump to ensure no excess metal was present, then was split into two samples. One sample was treated with excess ascorbate to ensure the cuprous form of the metalloprotein, and both samples were measured as an aqueous glass in 20% ethylene glycol at 10 K. Cu K-edge (8.9 keV) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption edge data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource on beamline 7–3 with an Si 220 monochromator, in fluorescence mode using a high-count rate Canberra 30-element Ge array detector. A Ni filter and a Soller slit were placed in line with the detector to attenuate the elastic scatter peak. For energy calibration, a Cu foil was placed between the second and third ionization chambers. In the case of the Cu 2+ -loaded sample, scans were taken from fresh surfaces of the sample window and their edges compared to ensure no photoreduction occurred, with a shutter in place in between scan points. Six scans of a buffer blank were averaged and subtracted from the raw data to produce a flat pre-edge and remove any residual Ni fluorescence. Data reduction and background subtraction were done using the EXAFSPAK suite, and the data were inspected for dropouts and glitches before averaging. The EXCURVE program was used for spectral simulations.
Samples of 60 μM MUC2 D1 were prepared in 50 mM MES buffer, pH 5.7, 100 mM NaCl. Where indicated, CuSO 4 was supplied at a concentration of 60 μM and, subsequently, ascorbic acid or quercetin was added to a concentration of 1.2 mM. Following a 5-min incubation, samples were exchanged into 50 mM MES buffer, pH 5.7, 100 mM NaCl using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns 7K MWCO (size exclusion) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove ascorbic acid or quercetin, when present, and any copper not bound to protein. After desalting, samples were diluted by a factor of three ( i.e ., to 20 μM MUC2 D1) into the same buffer containing bicinchoninic acid (BCA) (final BCA concentration 1 mM). Absorbance was measured at 562 nm, and data were converted to Cu 1+ concentration using an extinction coefficient of 7,900 M −1 cm −1 for the Cu 1+ -(BCA) 2 complex ( Young and Xiao, 2021 46. Young, T.R. ∙ Xiao, Z. Principles and practice of determining metal-protein affinities Biochem. J. 2021; 478 :1085-1116 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the Zn 2+ competition assay, protein was first incubated for 10 min with Zn 2+ (concentration ratios are indicated in Figure S1 C). Subsequently, Cu 2+ was added, and the buffer was exchanged using the spin columns described above. Ascorbic acid was added to the eluate to reduce any protein-bound Cu 2+ obtained, and BCA was used to quantify the resulting Cu 1+ .
UV/vis absorption spectra were recorded in a 1-cm quartz cuvette on an SI Photonics model 420 fiber optic CCD array spectrophotometer located inside a Siemens MBraun glove box under inert nitrogen atmosphere. Cu 1+ stock solutions were prepared by dissolving Cu(CH 3 CN) 4 PF 6 in anhydrous acetonitrile and subsequently standardized using the chromophoric ligand BCS. The apparent affinity constants for Cu 1+ of WT MUC2 D1 and various mutants were determined by competition titrations with colorimetric ligands (L) by using BCA as L in 50 mM MOPS buffer with 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, or ferrozine (Fz) or BCA as L in 50 mM MES buffer with 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.7 ( Xiao et al., 2013 45. Xiao, Z. ∙ Gottschlich, L. ∙ van der Meulen, R. ...

Young, T.R. ∙ Xiao, Z. Principles and practice of determining metal-protein affinities Biochem. J. 2021; 478 :1085-1116 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aliquots of 10 mM L stock were titrated into solutions containing 50 μM protein and 25 μM Cu(CH 3 CN) 4 PF 6 (for L = BCA) or 55 μM protein and 50 μM Cu(CH 3 CN) 4 PF 6 (for L = Fz) to establish the exchange equilibrium expressed by Equations 1 and 2 . Formation constants of 1.6 x 10 17 and 1.3 x 10 15 were used for Cu complexes with BCA and Fz, respectively ( Xiao et al., 2013 45. Xiao, Z. ∙ Gottschlich, L. ∙ van der Meulen, R. ... Evaluation of quantitative probes for weaker Cu(I) binding sites completes a set of four capable of detecting Cu(I) affinities from nanomolar to attomolar Metallomics. 2013; 5 :501 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The concentration of [Cu(BCA) 2 ] 3- complex was calculated from its absorbance at 562 nm (ε = 7,900 M −1 cm −1 ). The concentration of [Cu(Fz) 2 ] 3- complex was calculated from its absorbance at 470 nm (ε = 4,320 M −1 cm −1 ) ( Xiao et al., 2013 45. Xiao, Z. ∙ Gottschlich, L. ∙ van der Meulen, R. ...

Calculations of the other species present in solution were calculated from mass-balance equations. Data plotted as [L] vs. [Cu(L) 2 ] were fit to Equation 3 using GraphPad Prism software to obtain K exchange , where K exchange is designated as K, total [Cu] as M, total [MUC2 D1] as P, [L] as y, and [Cu(L) 2 ] as x P C u + 2 L → P + C u ( L ) ⁢ 2 (1) K e x c h a n g e = [ 𝑃 ] ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ ( 𝐿 ) 2 ] [ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑢 ] ⁢ [ 𝐿 ] 2 = 𝐾 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ ( 𝐿 ) 2 𝐾 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑢 (2) y = − √ ( − 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 2 ⁢ 𝑥 + 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑥 + 2 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑥 2 − 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑥 2 − 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑥 3 ) + 2 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑥 − 2 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑥 2 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 − 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑥 (3)
Absorbance was recorded in 1-cm quartz cuvettes on a nanophotometer np80 (Implen) spectrophotometer. Cu 2+ stock solution was prepared by dissolving copper sulfate in ultrapure water. Freshly prepared L-ascorbic acid (Sigma A0278) was added at a final concentration of 120 μM to buffered 8-μM or 4-μM Cu 2+ -protein solutions, as indicated in the figure for each experiment. Buffer was 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl.
Caco-2 cells were passaged in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine. Cells were seeded at density of 25,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate, 48 h prior to experiment. To initiate toxicity, cells were washed once with PBS, and additives for testing were supplied in serum-free medium. Proteins (wild-type or H324A/M326V MUC2 D1) and copper sulfate were supplied at 250 μM final concentrations. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking with BSA, cells were labeled with anti-E-cadherin antibody ab231303, 1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by an Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibody. Images were taken using a Olympus IX51 microscope equipped with Olympus XM10 camera.
Caco-2 cells were passaged in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), Pen-Strep, and L-glutamine. For copper starvation, medium was supplemented with 500 μM BCS for 9 days. During passaging under copper starvation conditions, cells were plated in parallel in 6 cm dishes. To initiate recovery, cells were washed once with PBS, and additives for testing were supplied in serum-free medium. After a further 3 days, cells were harvested by trypsinization and pelleted. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for COX1 levels by western blot (Anti-MTCO1 #ab14705). Bands were quantified using ImageJ software and normalized to the untreated sample for each biological experimental replicate.
LS174T cells (6 x 10 6 ) were seeded on a 10-cm tissue culture plate in serum-free medium. Supernatant was collected after 4 days in culture. Supernatant was centrifuged at 500xg for 10 min and concentrated by a factor of 10 using a 30 kDa cut-off centrifugal concentrator. SDS-PAGE was performed using a volume of 20 μL per lane. For western blotting of mucus extractions from mice, 1 cm segments of duodenum, intestine, and colon were incubated each in 300 μL of 8 M urea in PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail for 1 h at room temperature. Liquid was collected from the samples using a pipette and centrifuged at 17,000xg for 10 min. SDS-PAGE was performed using 35 μL of the supernatant per lane. Western blot analysis was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant human MUC2 D1 assembly and used at 8 μg/mL final concentration.
Errors for biochemical and cell biological experiments are reported as SD, and the number of measurements for each experiment is indicted in the figure legends. Statistical validation performed on the deposited atomic coordinate model was done using Phenix and is reported in Table S1 .
