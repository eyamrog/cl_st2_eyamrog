Title: Snake Venom Gland Organoids


Abstract: Summary

Wnt dependency and Lgr5 expression define multiple mammalian epithelial stem cell types. Under defined growth factor conditions, such adult stem cells (ASCs) grow as 3D organoids that recapitulate essential features of the pertinent epithelium. Here, we establish long-term expanding venom gland organoids from several snake species. The newly assembled transcriptome of the Cape coral snake reveals that organoids express high levels of toxin transcripts. Single-cell RNA sequencing of both organoids and primary tissue identifies distinct venom-expressing cell types as well as proliferative cells expressing homologs of known mammalian stem cell markers. A hard-wired regional heterogeneity in the expression of individual venom components is maintained in organoid cultures. Harvested venom peptides reflect crude venom composition and display biological activity. This study extends organoid technology to reptilian tissues and describes an experimentally tractable model system representing the snake venom gland.

Section: Introduction

Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease estimated to be responsible for >100,000 deaths worldwide each year ( Gutiérrez et al., 2017 24. Gutiérrez, J.M. ∙ Calvete, J.J. ∙ Habib, A.G. ... Snakebite envenoming Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2017; 3 :17063 Crossref Scopus (462) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon injection through specialized fangs, venomous snakes primarily use their venom to immobilize prey. For numerous snake species, the venom delivered by a single bite is enough to kill prey that is many times larger than the snake. During vertebrate evolution, the snake venom gland has been adapted from the salivary gland ( Kochva, 1987 31. Kochva, E. The origin of snakes and evolution of the venom apparatus Toxicon. 1987; 25 :65-106 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Secretory columnar cells in the gland epithelium secrete a complex mixture of peptides and proteins, stored in the lumen and channeled to the fangs through connecting ducts. Venom toxins are classified into distinct protein families with diverse modes-of-action ( Fry et al., 2009 20. Fry, B.G. ∙ Vidal, N. ∙ van der Weerd, L. ... Evolution and diversification of the Toxicofera reptile venom system J. Proteomics. 2009; 72 :127-136 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ), which makes them a rich source for drugs targeting human proteins ( Clark et al., 2019 11. Clark, G.C. ∙ Casewell, N.R. ∙ Elliott, C.T. ... Friends or Foes? Emerging Impacts of Biological Toxins Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :365-379 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Snake venoms differ greatly in toxin composition and the architecture of the machinery involved in its production and release. Venom from viperid snakes (such as the rattlesnake) mainly consists of hemotoxic enzymes ( Ainsworth et al., 2018 1. Ainsworth, S. ∙ Slagboom, J. ∙ Alomran, N. ... The paraspecific neutralisation of snake venom induced coagulopathy by antivenoms Commun. Biol. 2018; 1 :34 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas elapids (such as the king cobra) typically produce smaller peptides with neurotoxic effects ( Vonk et al., 2013 58. Vonk, F.J. ∙ Casewell, N.R. ∙ Henkel, C.V. ... The king cobra genome reveals dynamic gene evolution and adaptation in the snake venom system Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :20651-20656 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three-finger toxins (3FTxs) constitute a diverse and highly expressed class of toxins that mainly exert a neurotoxic effect through interaction with acetylcholine receptors ( Tsetlin, 2015 55. Tsetlin, V.I. Three-finger snake neurotoxins and Ly6 proteins targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: pharmacological tools and endogenous modulators Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2015; 36 :109-123 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (KUNs) also exert neurotoxic activities, although some are anticoagulant ( Harvey, 2001; Millers et al., 2009 26. Harvey, A.L. Twenty years of dendrotoxins Toxicon. 2001; 39 :15-26 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar 37. Millers, E.K. ∙ Trabi, M. ∙ Masci, P.P. ...

Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) proteins can act as myotoxins or neurotoxins and display antiplatelet activities ( Gutierrez and Lomonte, 2013 23. Gutierrez, J.M. ∙ Lomonte, B. Phospholipases A2: unveiling the secrets of a functionally versatile group of snake venom toxins Toxicon. 2013; 62 :27-39 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) block smooth muscle contraction ( Yamazaki and Morita, 2004 63. Yamazaki, Y. ∙ Morita, T. Structure and function of snake venom cysteine-rich secretory proteins Toxicon. 2004; 44 :227-231 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs), and C-type lectins (CTLs) mostly disrupt blood coagulation ( Slagboom et al., 2017; Izidoro et al., 2014 29. Izidoro, L.F. ∙ Sobrinho, J.C. ∙ Mendes, M.M. ... Snake venom L-amino acid oxidases: trends in pharmacology and biochemistry BioMed Res. Int. 2014; 2014 :196754 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Slagboom, J. ∙ Kool, J. ∙ Harrison, R.A. ... Haemotoxic snake venoms: their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise Br. J. Haematol. 2017; 177 :947-959 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Much still needs to be learned about toxin production and release cycles, heterogeneity of venom-producing cells, and factors influencing venom composition.
Organoids are defined as self-organizing 3D structures that can be grown from stem cells and that recapitulate essential features of the tissue under study ( Clevers, 2016 12. Clevers, H. Modeling Development and Disease with Organoids Cell. 2016; 165 :1586-1597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1952) PubMed Google Scholar ). We originally showed that a serum-free medium containing R-spondin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and Noggin suffices to support the growth of mouse Lgr5 + intestinal ASCs into ever-expanding epithelial organoids. These “mini-guts” contain all known cell types of the gut lining ( Sato et al., 2009 44. Sato, T. ∙ Vries, R.G. ∙ Snippert, H.J. ... Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche Nature. 2009; 459 :262-265 Crossref Scopus (5050) PubMed Google Scholar ), observations that were extended through single-cell RNA sequencing ( Grün et al., 2015; Beumer et al., 2018; Gehart et al., 2019 5. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar 21. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ...

Grün, D. ∙ Lyubimova, A. ∙ Kester, L. ... Single-cell messenger RNA sequencing reveals rare intestinal cell types Nature. 2015; 525 :251-255 Crossref Scopus (877) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, similar R-spondin-based protocols have been reported for a wide diversity of healthy and diseased mammalian epithelia ( Artegiani and Clevers, 2018 2. Artegiani, B. ∙ Clevers, H. Use and application of 3D-organoid technology Hum. Mol. Genet. 2018; 27 :R99-R107 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of interest to the current study, Maimets et al. (2016) 35. Maimets, M. ∙ Rocchi, C. ∙ Bron, R. ... Long-Term In Vitro Expansion of Salivary Gland Stem Cells Driven by Wnt Signals Stem Cell Reports. 2016; 6 :150-162 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar have demonstrated the feasibility of growing mammalian salivary gland organoids.
Little is known about the biology of adult stem cells in reptiles. Different short-term culture systems have been described for snake venom glands ( Sells et al., 1989; Carneiro et al., 2006 8. Carneiro, S.M. ∙ Zablith, M.B. ∙ Kerchove, C.M. ... Venom production in long-term primary culture of secretory cells of the Bothrops jararaca venom gland Toxicon. 2006; 47 :87-94 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar 47. Sells, P.G. ∙ Hommel, M. ∙ Theakston, R.D. Venom production in snake venom gland cells cultured in vitro Toxicon. 1989; 27 :1245-1249 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet long-term cultures capturing structural and functional properties of the snake venom gland have not been developed. Here, we aim to establish long-term culture conditions for functional snake venom gland epithelium using R-spondin-based organoid technology.

Section: Results

Venom glands from nine different snake species, representing members of both the Elapidae ( Naja pallida , Naja annulifera , Naja nivea , Naja atra , and Aspidelaps lubricus cowlesi ) and Viperidae ( Echis ocellatus , Deinagkistrodon acutus , Crotalus atrox , and Bitis arietans ) families, were dissociated and embedded in basement membrane extract (BME) at 32°C ( Figure 1 A). Supplying a medium containing a “generic” mammalian organoid cocktail (see below) resulted in initial expansion of organoids for all species ( Figures 1 B and S1 A) (some were subsequently lost due to bacterial contamination, insensitive to the antibiotics used). Passaging yielded expanding organoids that histologically resembled the original gland epithelium ( Figure 1 C). The venom gland organoids could be expanded optimally using R-spondin (the Wnt signal-amplifying ligand of Lgr5) ( de Lau et al., 2011 13. de Lau, W. ∙ Barker, N. ∙ Low, T.Y. ... Lgr5 homologues associate with Wnt receptors and mediate R-spondin signalling Nature. 2011; 476 :293-297 Crossref Scopus (1015) PubMed Google Scholar ), the BMP inhibitor Noggin, EGF, the small molecule TGF beta inhibitor A83-01, PGE2, and FGF10 ( Figures 1 D and S1 B). This “expansion medium” controls the same cellular signaling pathways that are required for mammalian epithelial organoids ( Fatehullah et al., 2016 18. Fatehullah, A. ∙ Tan, S.H. ∙ Barker, N. Organoids as an in vitro model of human development and disease Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :246-254 Crossref Scopus (1032) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reptilian organoid expansion was only successful at lower temperatures ( Figure S1 C), consistent with the average body temperature of poikilotherm species such as snakes. When cultured at 37°C, the standard for mammalian cells, a heat shock response ( HSPA8 ) was observed within 2 h, which is described to preclude cell division, and consequently prohibited organoid growth ( Richter et al., 2010 43. Richter, K. ∙ Haslbeck, M. ∙ Buchner, J. The heat shock response: life on the verge of death Mol. Cell. 2010; 40 :253-266 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1443) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 D). The proliferating cells self-organized into cystic spheres lined by a simple polarized epithelium ( Figure 1 E; Video S1 ), while budding of organoids was occasionally observed. Under these conditions, organoids expanded exponentially for >20 passages without significant changes in growth kinetics or morphology ( Figure 1 B). As demonstrated previously for mammalian organoids ( Bolhaqueiro et al., 2018 6. Bolhaqueiro, A.C.F. ∙ van Jaarsveld, R.H. ∙ Ponsioen, B. ... Live imaging of cell division in 3D stem-cell organoid cultures Methods Cell Biol. 2018; 145 :91-106 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), a lentiviral construct encoding histone 2B coupled to a fluorescent protein (H2B-RFP) allowed visualization of the organoid chromatin ( Figure S1 E).

Simultaneous withdrawal of all growth factors (with the exception of PGE2 to maintain cystic organoids) for 7 days resulted in less-proliferative organoids ( Figure 2 A). These organoids contained highly polarized cells with secretory vesicles, described previously as the main producers of venom in the snake venom gland ( Mackessy, 1991 34. Mackessy, S.P. Morphology and ultrastructure of the venom glands of the northern pacific rattlesnake Crotalus viridis oreganus J. Morphol. 1991; 208 :109-128 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 B). Furthermore, ciliated cells could occasionally be observed by electron microscopy ( Figure S1 F). High-speed imaging captured functionally beating cilia in a subset of organoids ( Video S2 ). Based on these features of apparently mature and functional cell types, we defined this cultured condition as our “differentiation” cocktail.

Snake venom contains dozens to hundreds of different bioactive compounds ( Fox and Serrano, 2008 19. Fox, J.W. ∙ Serrano, S.M. Exploring snake venom proteomes: multifaceted analyses for complex toxin mixtures Proteomics. 2008; 8 :909-920 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). No annotated genome exists for A. l. cowlesi. To gain deeper insight into the expression of individual toxin-encoding genes, we assembled a de novo transcriptome of A. l. cowlesi using Trinity ( Haas et al., 2013 25. Haas, B.J. ∙ Papanicolaou, A. ∙ Yassour, M. ... De novo transcript sequence reconstruction from RNA-seq using the Trinity platform for reference generation and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1494-1512 Crossref Scopus (5749) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 C). Libraries of contigs (311,948) generated from late-embryonic liver, pancreas, and venom gland as well as from venom gland organoids were used to determine gene-expression levels for each of the three tissues as well as the venom gland organoids. The organoid transcriptome showed toxins to represent the dominant class of expressed genes, while homologs of established markers of mammalian liver and pancreas were restricted to their corresponding organ ( Figure 2 D). Toxin expression in venom gland tissue was markedly lower compared to organoids, most likely due to presence of non-epithelial cells in gland tissue. Among the toxins, 3FTxs were most abundant ( Figure 2 E). We also detected expression of CRISPs, SVMPs, and KUNs ( Figures 2 E and S1 G). The relative abundance of these toxin classes matched the venom gland tissue at transcriptome level and the crude venom composition at protein level ( Whiteley et al., 2019 61. Whiteley, G. ∙ Casewell, N.R. ∙ Pla, D. ... Defining the pathogenic threat of envenoming by South African shield-nosed and coral snakes (genus Aspidelaps), and revealing the likely efficacy of available antivenom J. Proteomics. 2019; 198 :186-198 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 E). Of note, the 7-day differentiation protocol increased overall toxin gene expression but reduced the expression of CRISP ( Figures 2 D and 2E). We concluded that A. l. cowlesi organoids produced a near-normal spectrum of venom factors.
To further demonstrate the long-term propagation capacity of adult venom-gland-derived cells using our protocol, we expanded organoids from Naja nivea , the Cape cobra. Venom glands from a euthanized adult individual (>1-year-old) were dissociated and cultured using the same conditions as used above ( Figure 3 A). Organoids recapitulated the epithelial phenotype and were expanded for over 18 passages ( Figures 3 A and 3B). While cells were viable and proliferating in “expansion medium,” we noticed reduced swelling (smaller lumen) in N. nivea organoids making it more difficult to mechanically split these cultures. Upon additional activation of cyclic AMP using forskolin (FSK), organoids exhibited improved swelling allowing easier splitting ( Figure 3 C). For further passaging (after passage 5) of N. nivea organoids, we supplemented expansion medium with FSK. Forskolin-induced swelling is well known in primary human intestinal organoids, where it is used to monitor the ability to transport chloride ions ( Dekkers et al., 2013 14. Dekkers, J.F. ∙ Wiegerinck, C.L. ∙ de Jonge, H.R. ... A functional CFTR assay using primary cystic fibrosis intestinal organoids Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :939-945 Crossref Scopus (767) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Exposure to “differentiation medium,” including the withdrawal of FSK resulted in the expected phenotype of less proliferative organoids ( Figure 3 D) accompanied by increased expression of 3FTx and KUN by qPCR ( Figure 3 E). To establish a “deep” gene expression profile, we performed bulk mRNA sequencing of N. nivea organoids in differentiation medium. PolyA enriched reads could be mapped to the de novo A. l. cowlesi transcriptome ( Figure 2 C). We thus identified a number of putative toxins enriched in organoids from N. nivea , such as beta-bungarotoxin-like, kappa-bungarotoxin-like, and sarafotoxin-like ( Figure 3 F). 3FTxs are the main venom components of elapid snakes. Utilizing the high sequence conservation of 3FTX , we were able to PCR-amplify the coding sequence of several variants starting from A. l. cowlesi and N. nivea organoid cDNA ( Figure 3 G). When translating these 3FTX coding sequences in silico , we detected peptide sequences that have not been described before in the NCBI database and are specific to the individual species ( Figure 3 H).
Because our access to A. l. cowlesi venom gland material was more regular (one clutch a year), we focused our further characterization on organoid lines derived from A. l. cowlesi .
The cellular heterogeneity of the venom gland epithelium has largely been described morphologically. We have recently demonstrated the usefulness of organoids for the detailed delineation of cell lineages in the enteroendocrine compartment of the gut ( Beumer et al., 2018 5. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using a similar strategy, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of organoids in expansion and differentiation medium and compared it to their primary tissue counterparts obtained from A. l. cowlesi late embryonic venom gland. From organoids, a total of 1,536 cells were sorted, processed using the SORT-seq method ( Muraro et al., 2016 38. Muraro, M.J. ∙ Dharmadhikari, G. ∙ Grun, D. ... A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :385-394 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ) and analyzed using the RaceID3 package ( Herman et al., 2018 28. Herman, J.S. ∙ Sagar ∙ Grün, D. FateID infers cell fate bias in multipotent progenitors from single-cell RNA-seq data Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :379-386 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads were mapped to the de novo assembled A. l. cowlesi transcriptome, processed using a newly generated pipeline and filtered for >2,000 transcripts per cell. The 1,092 cells that passed the thresholds displayed a median expression of 10,480 transcript counts per cell ( Figures S2 A and S2B). K-medoids-based clustering compartmentalized the cells into 12 different cell clusters, as visualized by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) ( Figure 4 A). Cells derived from expansion and differentiation medium clustered mostly separately ( Figure 4 B). Expression of one of the most abundant 3FTxs ( Pr-SNTX ) ( Figure S1 G) revealed the presence of at least 4 cell clusters producing venom factors ( Figure 4 C). In line with the bulk transcriptome data, the vast majority of venom-producing cells were derived from differentiated organoids.
Single-cell RNA sequencing of freshly isolated venom gland tissue (using the same pipeline as for the organoid cells) yielded 1,255 cells that passed the same threshold ( Figure 4 D). Based on their transcriptomic profile, these cells fell into 20 different cell clusters ( Figure 4 D). Using mammalian markers of cell types expected to be present in glandular organs, we determined the following composition of our dataset: 53% epithelial cells ( EPCAM , KRT8 ) ( Figures 4 E and S2 C), 27% stromal cells ( COL3A1 ), 8% hematopoietic cells ( HEMGN, LYZ ), 7% smooth muscle cells ( ACTA2 ), and 4% endothelium ( CDH5 ) ( Figure S2 C). Expression of 3FTx Pr-SNTX was highest in two of the cell clusters of epithelial origin ( Figure 4 F). We also detected strong co-expression of protein disulfide isomerase ( PDI ) with 3FTx variants ( Scutellatus toxin 3 ) in the organoids ( Figure 4 G) as well as in the primary tissue cells ( Figure 4 H). This enzyme is a key factor to ensure correct disulfide bond folding ( Wang and Tsou, 1993 59. Wang, C.C. ∙ Tsou, C.L. Protein disulfide isomerase is both an enzyme and a chaperone FASEB J. 1993; 7 :1515-1517 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ), conceivably supporting the disulfide bond-rich structure of three finger toxins. A more detailed analysis of toxin-related gene expression per cluster uncovered that individual venom factors were strongly enriched in separate organoid clusters, suggesting the presence of specialized cells for some of the toxin families ( Figure S2 D).
We then extracted all 670 epithelial cells from the dataset and performed reclustering ( Figure S2 E). This resulted in 10 different epithelial subclusters, each enriched for different venom factors. Comparing the heterogeneity in the expression of different toxin classes (3FTx, CRISP, KUN, SVMP, and CTL), we concluded that organoids successfully recapitulate the cellular complexity of venom producing cells in vivo ( Figure S2 F).
Cluster 1 in organoids and cluster 6 in primary tissue comprised cells enriched for transcripts of 3FTx genes ( Figure S3 A), a subset of these cells additionally expressed Kunitz variants ( KUN s) ( Figure S3 B). The cells in cluster 4 (organoids) and cluster 6 and 8 (tissue) were positive for SVMP ( Figure S3 C). Organoid cells expressing CRISP genes were enriched in cluster 11 and 12; in the tissue these genes were found to be expressed in a larger number of cells enriched in cluster 3 ( Figure S3 D). Organoid cluster 3 consisted of cells co-expressing CTL and Waprin-related toxins ( Figure S3 E) ( Torres et al., 2003; Ogawa et al., 2005 41. Ogawa, T. ∙ Chijiwa, T. ∙ Oda-Ueda, N. ... Molecular diversity and accelerated evolution of C-type lectin-like proteins from snake venom Toxicon. 2005; 45 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Torres, A.M. ∙ Wong, H.Y. ∙ Desai, M. ... Identification of a novel family of proteins in snake venoms. Purification and structural characterization of nawaprin from Naja nigricollis snake venom J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :40097-40104 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). CTLs have not previously been detected in the Aspidelaps lubricus venom proteome and did not form an independent cluster in the tissue dataset ( Whiteley et al., 2019 61. Whiteley, G. ∙ Casewell, N.R. ∙ Pla, D. ... Defining the pathogenic threat of envenoming by South African shield-nosed and coral snakes (genus Aspidelaps), and revealing the likely efficacy of available antivenom J. Proteomics. 2019; 198 :186-198 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cluster 5, containing cells exclusively derived from differentiated organoids, was devoid of any known toxin expression. Comparing this cluster with venom producing clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4, we found these cells to be enriched in extracellular matrix component transcripts such as laminin ( LAMA3 ) ( Figure 4 I). This transcriptomic separation is indicative of two different cellular lineages captured by the organoids, an “epithelial supportive cell” (EP-SUP) fate and a “toxin producing cell” (TOX) fate ( Figure S4 A). In the complete dataset of venom gland tissue cells, we found clusters 7, 15, and 19 to be enriched in LAMA3 expression, while these cells expressed much fewer toxin transcripts compared to the other epithelial cells ( Figures 4 J and S4 B). In organoids, as well as tissue, the EP-SUP lineage additionally expressed CTGF , COL7A1 , and FRZB ( Figures S4 C–S4E). Based on our single cell sequencing of the venom gland tissue, all epithelial lineages/cell types were represented in the organoids. Importantly, marker expression analysis of each of the 12 cell clusters in early and late passage organoids supported the notion that cellular composition of organoids was stable over time in culture ( Figure S4 F).
Having identified the distribution of toxin expression in differentiated cells, we next focused on the expression patterns specific to cell clusters observed under expansion conditions. While some cells in expansion medium clustered together with toxin-expressing cells in clusters 1, 4, 11, and 12, the vast majority fell within the expansion medium-specific clusters 6–10 ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Cluster 10 was distinct in displaying high expression of phospholipase A2 inhibitor ( PLI ) ( Figure S5 A), previously described in other snake species as a self-protective mechanism against venom PLA2 toxins ( Lima et al., 2011 33. Lima, R.M. ∙ Estevao-Costa, M.I. ∙ Junqueira-de-Azevedo, I.L. ... Phospholipase A2 inhibitors (betaPLIs) are encoded in the venom glands of Lachesis muta (Crotalinae, Viperidae) snakes Toxicon. 2011; 57 :172-175 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression of PLI was also found in epithelial cells from primary tissue ( Figure S5 B).
Cells in organoid clusters 7, 8, and 9 expressed the proliferation marker Ki-67 ( MKI67 ) ( Figure 5 A). Transcripts for the snake homologs of the mammalian stem cell markers RNF43 ( Koo et al., 2012 32. Koo, B.K. ∙ Spit, M. ∙ Jordens, I. ... Tumour suppressor RNF43 is a stem-cell E3 ligase that induces endocytosis of Wnt receptors Nature. 2012; 488 :665-669 Crossref Scopus (730) PubMed Google Scholar ), ASCL2 ( van der Flier et al., 2009 57. van der Flier, L.G. ∙ van Gijn, M.E. ∙ Hatzis, P. ...

Barker, N. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Kuipers, J. ... Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5 Nature. 2007; 449 :1003-1007 Crossref Scopus (4383) PubMed Google Scholar ) were enriched in these clusters and were specifically observed under expansion conditions, while being rare in primary tissue ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S5 C–S5F). This implied these clusters to represent reptilian adult stem/progenitor cells.
Addition of R-spondin 3 enhanced expression of the stem cell markers LGR5 , ASCL2 , and RNF43 together with the well-established Wnt targets TCF7L2 and AXIN2 . Supplementation of exogenous Wnt3a further increased expression of these marker genes. As expected, stimulation of the Wnt pathway also induced the proliferation marker MKI67 ( Figure 5 C). A. l. cowlesi LGR5 shares the same leucine-rich repeats and transmembrane helices with high conservation in the R-spondin interacting residues (R144, D146, V213, V214, and H216) compared to the human protein ( Figure 5 D) ( Chen et al., 2013 10. Chen, P.H. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Lin, Z. ... The structural basis of R-spondin recognition by LGR5 and RNF43 Genes Dev. 2013; 27 :1345-1350 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, human R-spondin 3 was found to be essential for organoid expansion ( Figures 1 D, 5 E, and S1 B).
The non-epithelial niche is replaced in organoid culture by the addition of defined exogenous growth factors. Using the single-cell sequencing dataset of venom gland tissue, we searched for expression of such secreted factors. We detected the EP-SUP cluster as an epithelial source of WTN10A expression ( Figure S5 G). Stromal cells (clusters 4, 6, 13, and 18) specifically expressed WNT9A , FGF7 , and the BMP-antagonists CHRD ( Piccolo et al., 1996 42. Piccolo, S. ∙ Sasai, Y. ∙ Lu, B. ... Dorsoventral patterning in Xenopus: inhibition of ventral signals by direct binding of chordin to BMP-4 Cell. 1996; 86 :589-598 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (937) PubMed Google Scholar ) and FSTL1 ( Sylva et al., 2011 50. Sylva, M. ∙ Li, V.S. ∙ Buffing, A.A. ... The BMP antagonist follistatin-like 1 is required for skeletal and lung organogenesis PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e22616 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S5 H–S5K). As expected, transcripts for these proteins with a stromal source in vivo were not detected in the organoids.
Pseudotemporal ordering of venom gland organoid cells grown in expansion and differentiation medium using Monocle ( Trapnell et al., 2014 53. Trapnell, C. ∙ Cacchiarelli, D. ∙ Grimsby, J. ... The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (3552) PubMed Google Scholar ) was then applied to shed light on the venom gland stem cell hierarchy. Cells from the proliferative progenitor clusters 7, 8, and 9 were placed at the start of the pseudotime axis, in agreement with their stem/progenitor state. A bifurcation was formed by the EP-SUP cells of cluster 5 and TOX cells from clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4 ( Figure 5 F–5H). To confirm the lack of proliferative and stem cell capacity in the mature clusters (clusters 1–5, Figures 4 A and 4B), we differentiated organoids using the growth factor depletion described above. This caused a dramatic reduction in outgrowth and proliferative capacity compared to expansion conditions ( Figures 5 I and 5J).
Secretory cells of other mammalian organs, such as the intestine, display regional variation in the types of secreted products. For instance, organoids derived from different regions of the mouse small intestine produce a region-specific repertoire of hormones that is maintained indefinitely in vitro ( Beumer et al., 2018 5. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). We investigated regional heterogeneity in toxin production in the snake venom gland using our organoid culture system. The venom gland of embryonic A. l. cowlesi was dissected into a proximal (located near the duct) and a distal part and established region-specific organoids ( Figure 6 A). After culturing organoids for 1 month (4 passages), we analyzed toxin expression in expansion and differentiation medium by qPCR. We found CTL expression to be strongly enriched in “proximal” organoids, whereas “distal” organoids cells predominantly produced 3FTX and KUN toxins ( Figure 6 B).
Next, we utilized RNA in situ hybridization to visualize the expression of these toxins in venom gland tissue. We found a strong enrichment of CTL transcripts in the proximal part of the gland, whereas KUN was predominantly expressed in the distal tissue, confirming our findings in organoids ( Figures 6 C, S5 L, and S5M). This is in line with a previous report of CTL expression in the proximally located accessory gland in the king cobra ( Vonk et al., 2013 58. Vonk, F.J. ∙ Casewell, N.R. ∙ Henkel, C.V. ... The king cobra genome reveals dynamic gene evolution and adaptation in the snake venom system Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :20651-20656 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRISP expression was homogeneous along the proximal-distal axis of the gland, while displaying a bias toward basal over luminal cells ( Figure 6 C). These data highlighted regional heterogeneity in toxin expression in the snake venom gland ( Figure 6 D). Long-term maintenance of this phenotype in organoid culture showed this not to be determined by extrinsic (non-epithelial) growth factors.
To investigate whether the stem-cell-based organoids produced functionally active venom components, we analyzed organoid protein extracts after 7 days of differentiation. The presence of secretory vesicles and the apparent accumulation of proteins in the lumen of organoids suggested significant production of secretory proteins ( Figures 2 B and 7 A). To validate functional translation and secretion of toxins, we generated a fluorescent 3FTx reporter organoid line. Using CRISPR-HOT (J.B., H.C., B. Artegiani, and D. Hendriks, unpublished data), we tagged one of the endogenous 3FTxs ( NTX4 ) with a fluorescent protein (mNeon-Green) ( Figure S6 A). We detected the green fluorescent fusion protein inside the cells of the organoids and accumulating in the lumen ( Figure S6 A).
We also directly compared organoid extract ( Figure 7 B) with A. l. cowlesi crude venom using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This revealed three main peaks between 6–8 kDa of near identical mass between the two samples ( Figure 7 C). Tryptic digest analysis of these peptides yielded patterns compatible with several venom-related proteins such as 3FTx and CRISP ( Figure S6 B).
Snake venom neurotoxins are described to act primarily on acetylcholine receptors (nAChR and mAChR) ( Nirthanan and Gwee, 2004; Karlsson et al., 2000 30. Karlsson, E. ∙ Jolkkonen, M. ∙ Mulugeta, E. ... Snake toxins with high selectivity for subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors Biochimie. 2000; 82 :793-806 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Nirthanan, S. ∙ Gwee, M.C. Three-finger alpha-neurotoxins and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, forty years on J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94 :1-17 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). As an initial assessment of the biological activity of organoid-secreted venom peptides, we exposed murine muscle cultures (endogenously expressing the nAChR) to the organoid supernatant and recorded signal propagation using calcium imaging in an OrganoPlate ( Trietsch et al., 2017 54. Trietsch, S.J. ∙ Naumovska, E. ∙ Kurek, D. ... Membrane-free culture and real-time barrier integrity assessment of perfused intestinal epithelium tubes Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :262 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 7 D and S6 C–S6F). This organ-on-a-chip platform allows live cell imaging during venom exposure in 96 independent mature muscle cultures per plate. The venom peptides derived from differentiated organoids abolished the stimulatory effect of the acetylcholine receptor agonist carbachol on muscle cells, as did the positive control alpha-bungarotoxin (α-BTX). Supernatant from non-venom producing (human) organoids did not inhibit calcium wave propagation after addition of carbachol ( Figures 7 E and S6 G–S6I).
In a similar set-up, we exposed rat cortical neurons grown on microelectrode array (MEA) plates to organoid supernatant and recorded neuronal activity ( Figure S7 A). Upon acute exposure, we noticed a marked increase in neuronal activity, following a similar trend observed with recombinant alpha-bungarotoxin ( Figures S7 B–S7D). This occurred most likely through an antagonistic effect on inhibitory GABAa-receptors ( McCann et al., 2006 36. McCann, C.M. ∙ Bracamontes, J. ∙ Steinbach, J.H. ... The cholinergic antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin also binds and blocks a subset of GABA receptors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :5149-5154 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), without affecting neuronal cell viability ( Figures S7 E–S7G).

Section: Discussion

We report the establishment of reptilian adult stem-cell-based organoids. Using a mammalian niche growth factor cocktail, these cells can be expanded seemingly indefinitely. The ability to culture venom gland epithelial cells over long periods of time represents a platform for a comprehensive understanding of the biology of the venom gland and the various venom constituents. Short-term cultures of different Viperidae snakes have previously been reported, such as explants of Bothrops jararaca ( Carneiro et al., 2006; Yamanouye et al., 2006 8. Carneiro, S.M. ∙ Zablith, M.B. ∙ Kerchove, C.M. ... Venom production in long-term primary culture of secretory cells of the Bothrops jararaca venom gland Toxicon. 2006; 47 :87-94 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Yamanouye, N. ∙ Kerchove, C.M. ∙ Moura-da-Silva, A.M. ... Long-term primary culture of secretory cells of Bothrops jararaca venom gland for venom production in vitro Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2763-2766 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), suspension cultures of Bitis gabonica ( Sells et al., 1989 47. Sells, P.G. ∙ Hommel, M. ∙ Theakston, R.D. Venom production in snake venom gland cells cultured in vitro Toxicon. 1989; 27 :1245-1249 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), and unpolarized two-dimensional cell lines of Crotalus durissus terrificus ( Duarte et al., 1999 17. Duarte, M.M. ∙ Montes de Oca, H. ∙ Diniz, C.R. ... Primary culture of venom gland cells from the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus) Toxicon. 1999; 37 :1673-1682 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). The venom gland organoid cultures provides advantages in structural conservation ( Figure 1 C), cellular heterogeneity ( Figure 4 ), regional heterogeneity ( Figure 6 ), long-term expansion ( Figures 1 B and 3 A), genetic modifiability ( Figures S1 E and S6 A), and broad applicability across snake species ( Figure S1 A). With a de novo- generated transcriptome of A. l. cowlesi , we demonstrate that the venom gland organoid cells produce a diverse spectrum of venom factors over many passages ( Figure 2 ).
Previous mammalian organoid cultures have highlighted the importance of Wnt-driven stem cell maintenance in vitro ( Clevers, 2016 12. Clevers, H. Modeling Development and Disease with Organoids Cell. 2016; 165 :1586-1597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1952) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we identify a proliferative population of cells in the venom gland organoids that is defined by the expression of the snake homologs of established Wnt-driven stem cell genes of mammalian epithelia: LGR5 ( Barker et al., 2007 4. Barker, N. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Kuipers, J. ... Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5 Nature. 2007; 449 :1003-1007 Crossref Scopus (4383) PubMed Google Scholar ), ASCL2 ( van der Flier et al., 2009 57. van der Flier, L.G. ∙ van Gijn, M.E. ∙ Hatzis, P. ... Transcription factor achaete scute-like 2 controls intestinal stem cell fate Cell. 2009; 136 :903-912 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (586) PubMed Google Scholar ), and RNF43 ( Koo et al., 2012 32. Koo, B.K. ∙ Spit, M. ∙ Jordens, I. ... Tumour suppressor RNF43 is a stem-cell E3 ligase that induces endocytosis of Wnt receptors Nature. 2012; 488 :665-669 Crossref Scopus (730) PubMed Google Scholar ). The importance of R-spondin in reptilian cell proliferation highlights the critical role and a high level of conservation of the Wnt pathway in ASC biology. We believe that the culture conditions used here may be widely applicable to vertebrate species.
While a divergent composition of snake venoms between species, and even between and within individuals, is well-established ( Casewell et al., 2014; Augusto-de-Oliveira et al., 2016; Zancolli et al., 2019 3. Augusto-de-Oliveira, C. ∙ Stuginski, D.R. ∙ Kitano, E.S. ... Dynamic Rearrangement in Snake Venom Gland Proteome: Insights into Bothrops jararaca Intraspecific Venom Variation J. Proteome Res. 2016; 15 :3752-3762 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar 9. Casewell, N.R. ∙ Wagstaff, S.C. ∙ Wüster, W. ... Medically important differences in snake venom composition are dictated by distinct postgenomic mechanisms Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :9205-9210 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Zancolli, G. ∙ Calvete, J.J. ∙ Cardwell, M.D. ... When one phenotype is not enough: divergent evolutionary trajectories govern venom variation in a widespread rattlesnake species Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182735 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ), the cellular heterogeneity underlying the production of individual toxins is not well described. Initial attempts at characterizing the cell types of the snake venom gland through electron microscopy has resulted in the morphological identification of at least 4 cell types, of which columnar epithelial cells containing granules have been suggested to be the main source of venom production and secretion ( Mackessy, 1991 34. Mackessy, S.P. Morphology and ultrastructure of the venom glands of the northern pacific rattlesnake Crotalus viridis oreganus J. Morphol. 1991; 208 :109-128 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). The amount and type of venom detectable in individual cells is influenced by the secretory cycle, referring to temporal dynamics in venom production and secretion ( Taylor et al., 1986; Shaham and Kochva, 1969 48. Shaham, N. ∙ Kochva, E. Localization of venom antigens in the venom gland of Vipera plaestinae using a fluorescent-antibody technique Toxicon. 1969; 6 :263-268 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Taylor, D. ∙ Iddon, D. ∙ Sells, P. ... An investigation of venom secretion by the venom gland cells of the carpet viper (Echis carinatus) Toxicon. 1986; 24 :651-659 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). A previous study identified heterogeneity in the binding of single-component antibodies to secretory granules and attributed this mainly to the secretory cycle-dependent production of toxins rather than cellular heterogeneity of the venom gland ( Taylor et al., 1986 51. Taylor, D. ∙ Iddon, D. ∙ Sells, P. ... An investigation of venom secretion by the venom gland cells of the carpet viper (Echis carinatus) Toxicon. 1986; 24 :651-659 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our data describe cellular heterogeneity in the venom gland epithelium at the level of transcription. Gene expression profiling at single cell resolution of both organoids and primary tissue uncovers the coincident expression of characteristic groups of toxins by individual cell types. Future studies may use venom gland organoids to dissect the stimuli and timing of venom production and secretion. The ability to indefinitely expand these organoids and repeatedly harvest venom supernatants in a highly defined environment may help overcome hurdles posed by the significant variation in snake venom composition.
Finally, the current study opens new avenues for bioprospecting of snake venom components and may be developed into a production platform for (modified) snake venom, allowing novel therapeutic strategies to tackle snakebite.

All animal procedures complied with local ethical guidelines. Adult Crotalus atrox (n = 2) venom glands were purchased from Natural Toxins Research Center in Texas, USA. Adult Echis ocellatus (n = 1) and Deinagkistrodon acutus (n = 1) venom glands were obtained from snakes maintained at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK. Adult Naja pallida (n = 1), Naja nivea (n = 1) and Bitis arietans (n = 2) venom glands were obtained from residual post-mortem material from Serpo, Rijswijk, the Netherlands. Embryonic Naja atra (n = 2), Naja annulifera (n = 3) and Aspidelaps lubricus cowlesi (n = 7, two different nests) from eggs were obtained from local breeders in the Netherlands. All snakes were captive bred and maintained in individual cages within a temperature, humidity and light-controlled environment according to local protocols for husbandry of venomous snakes. Sex of the animals was not determined as it was presumed to have no biological impact on the experimental procedure or conclusion of the study. Non-invasive venom extraction (‘milking’) was performed with adult Echis ocellatus, Deinagkistrodon acutus, Naja pallida , Naja nivea and Bitis arietans during lifetime prior to euthanizing and venom gland isolation for organoid culture.
Cells from a single gland were plated in approximately 100 μL Cultrex Pathclear Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Extract (BME) (3533-001, Amsbio). After BME solidification, culture medium was added. Expansion culture medium was based on AdDMEM/F12 (GIBCO) supplemented with B27, Glutamax, HEPES, 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (all Thermo-Fisher), 100 mg/mL Primocin (Invivogen), 1.25mM N-acetylcysteine, 10 mM Nicotinamide (both Sigma-Aldrich) and the following growth factors: 2% Noggin conditioned medium (U-Protein Express), 2% Rspo3 conditioned medium (U-Protein Express), 50 ng/mL EGF (Peprotech), 0.5 μM A83-01 (Tocris), 1 μM PGE2 (Tocris), 100 ng/mL FGF10 (Peprotech), 100 nM Gastrin (Tocris). Naja nivea organoid cultures were supplemented with 1 μM FSK (Tocris). For the first seven days after seeding, the expansion medium was supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 (Abmole). In case of bacterial contaminations following antibiotics were added: 50 mg/mL Gentamicin (Sigma), 2.5 μg/ml Ciprofloxacin (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 μM Erythromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 nM Azithromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Ten days after seeding organoids were removed from the BME, mechanically dissociated into small fragments using a Pasteur pipette and re-seeded in fresh BME. Passage was performed in 1:3 – 1:5 split ratio once every ten days for at least 6 months.
The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (91031101). Sigma is partnered with the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC) repository. Cells were cultured in T75 flasks (734-2705, Corning) in DMEM (11965092, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, 16140-071, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2 mM glutamine (G7513, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P4333, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C. C2C12 cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination and were found negative.
Primary rat cortical cells were isolated from postnatal day 0-1 pups of timed pregnant Wistar rat dams (Envigo) as described previously ( Dingemans et al., 2016 16. Dingemans, M.M. ∙ Schütte, M.G. ∙ Wiersma, D.M. ... Chronic 14-day exposure to insecticides or methylmercury modulates neuronal activity in primary rat cortical cultures Neurotoxicology. 2016; 57 :194-202 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, pups were decapitated and cortices were rapidly dissected on ice and kept in dissection medium (Neurobasal®-A supplemented with 25 g/L sucrose, 450 μM L-glutamine, 30 μM glutamate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS, pH 7.4) during the entire procedure. Cortices were dissociated to a single-cell suspension by mincing with scissors, trituration and filtering through a 100 μm mesh (EASYstrainer, Greiner). The cell suspension was diluted to a 2 × 106 cells/mL solution. Droplets of 50 μL were placed on the electrode fields in wells of 48-wells MEA plates (Axion BioSystems) pre-coated with 0.1% PEI solution diluted in borate buffer (24 mM sodium borate/50 mM boric acid in Milli-Q, pH adjusted to 8.4). Cells were left to adhere for 2 hours before adding 450 μL dissection medium. Primary rat cortical cultures were kept at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. At day in vitro (DIV) 2, 90% of the dissection medium was replaced with glutamate medium (Neurobasal®-A supplemented with 25 g/L sucrose, 450 μM L-glutamine, 30 μM glutamate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% B27 supplement, pH 7.4) to prevent glial overgrowth. At DIV4, 90% of the glutamate medium was replaced with FBS medium (Neurobasal®-A supplemented with 25 g/L sucrose, 450 μM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS, pH 7.4).
In the last week of development (∼day 53 – 58), snakes were removed from the egg by an incision in the shell. To avoid bacterial contamination, eggs were briefly rinsed with bleach and 70% ethanol prior to opening in a laminar flow cabinet. Animals were directly euthanized by decapitation. The late-embryonic and adult venom glands were surgically removed and stored on ice in AdDMEM/F12 (GIBCO) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin.
Isolated venom glands were chopped into small pieces of approximately 1 mm using a scalpel. Muscle and connective tissue were removed and discarded as much as possible. Epithelial tissue pieces were enzymatically digested in 5 mL collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, C9407, 1 mg/mL) with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Abmole, M1817) in AdDMEM/F12 (GIBCO) for about 30 minutes while shaking (120 RPM) at 32°C. The homogeneous cell suspension was pelleted and washed twice with AdDMEM/F12 prior to plating
For differentiation experiments, established organoids were passaged and grown in expansion medium for four days. After four days, the medium was removed and residual medium washed away two times with PBS, after which differentiation medium was added containing; a base of AdDMEM/F12 (GIBCO) supplemented with GlutaMAX, HEPES, 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (all Thermo-Fisher), 100 μg/mL Primocin (InvivoGen), 1.25mM N-acetylcysteine, 10 mM Nicotinamide (both Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μM PGE2 (Tocris) applied for seven days
Quantification of cell viability/outgrowth efficiency was performed using CellTiter-Glo® accoring to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Wnt-conditioned medium was produced as previously described, and used at 50% of the medium volume ( Sato et al., 2011 45. Sato, T. ∙ Stange, D.E. ∙ Ferrante, M. ... Long-term expansion of epithelial organoids from human colon, adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and Barrett’s epithelium Gastroenterology. 2011; 141 :1762-1772 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2617) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Images of organoid cultures were taken on EVOS FL Cell Imaging System (Thermo Fisher). Video of beating cilia in organoid was captured (20 frames/second, 20x objective) on EVOS FL Auto 2 (Thermo Fisher).
pLV lentiviral vector containing a CMV promoter driving the expression of TagRFP and Puro resistance gene (via IRES) was transduced in venom gland organoids.
Organoids were harvested in cell recovery solution (354253, Corning) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 2 hours at room temperature. Venom glands used for immunohistochemistry (n = 3) were directly embedded in 4% paraformaldehyde upon dissection and fixed for at least 2 hours. Samples were washed and dehydrated by an increasing ethanol gradient before embedding in paraffin. Sections were cut and hydrated before staining. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining on organoids and tissue was performed as previously described ( Sato et al., 2009 44. Sato, T. ∙ Vries, R.G. ∙ Snippert, H.J. ... Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche Nature. 2009; 459 :262-265 Crossref Scopus (5050) PubMed Google Scholar ). Slides were imaged using a Leica DM4000 microscope.
3D imaging of organoids was performed as described previously ( Dekkers et al., 2019 15. Dekkers, J.F. ∙ Alieva, M. ∙ Wellens, L.M. ... High-resolution 3D imaging of fixed and cleared organoids Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :1756-1771 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, organoids were harvested using ice cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 45 min. Organoids were then washed with PBT (PBS, 0.1% Tween) and incubated overnight with primary antibodies, B-catenin (H-102, Santa Cruz) and b-tubulin (H-235 Santa Cruz). The next day, organoids were washed with PBT (PBS, 0.1% Tween) and incubated overnight at 4°C with secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor-647 Phalloidin (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DAPI (Invitrogen). Dense organoids were optically cleared overnight in a glycerol-fructose clearing solution prior to imaging. Cystic organoids were not optically cleared to prevent these from collapsing. Organoid imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 using a 10x dry and 25x oil immersion objective. Imaris imaging software was used for 3D rendering of images.
For immunofluorescence in the OrganoPlate, cultures were fixed and stained as previously described ( Wevers et al., 2018 60. Wevers, N.R. ∙ Kasi, D.G. ∙ Gray, T. ... A perfused human blood-brain barrier on-a-chip for high-throughput assessment of barrier function and antibody transport Fluids Barriers CNS. 2018; 15 :23 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following antibodies were used: anti-myosin (A4.1025, DSHB), anti-desmin (ab8470, Abcam), anti-dystrophin (ab15277, Abcam), goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 555 (A21422, Thermo Fisher Scientific), goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 647 (A21236, Thermo Fisher Scientific), goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 555 (A32732, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and donkey anti-rabbit 647 (SAB4600177, Sigma-Aldrich). The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was visualized using α-bungarotoxin AlexaFluor 488 (B13422, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nuclei were stained using Hoechst (H3570, Thermo Fisher Scientific). All steps were performed at room temperature (RT). Cells were imaged using the Micro XLS-C HCI System (Molecular Devices). A 3D reconstruction of a myotube culture was made using Fiji.
Late embryonic A. l. cowlesi heads (n = 2) were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Fixed heads were divided in two through the midline of the body, separating the left and right venom gland. Material was dehydrated using sequential methanol steps (25, 50, 75, 100%), washed with three times for one hour 100% ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 10 μm were deparaffinized (nucleoclear, ethanol, Milli-Q) and pretreated (PBST, ProtK 10 min, PBS and 4% PFA). For hybridization, slides were covered with hybridization mix for one hour at 60°C (2% blocking powder, 50% formamide, 5x SSC, 1mg/mL tRNA, 50 μg/mL heparin, 0,1% Triton X-100, 0,1% CHAPS and 5mM EDTA) prior to overnight incubation with probe mix (800 - 1000 ng/mL) at 60°C. On the next day, the slides were washed (2x SSC, 0,1% CHAPS, 50% Formamide) for 30 minutes three times prior to overnight anti-Dig-AP (in 10% sheep serum) incubation at 4°C. Signal was visualized using BM-purple and counterstained with 0,1% neutral red. Images were taken on a Leica DM4000 microscope.
Following primers were used for probe generation: CRISP F_TGCTGCAACAGTCTTCTGGAAC R_ATATAGTTTGCATGAAGGGCATCA CTL F_TCTGGGGATTCTGCCTCTTG R_ACTTGCAGATGAAGGGCAGG KUN F_CCCTGCTTAACTTCCCCCAA R_GGCAGGGTCTCCAGGAAGG
Aspidelaps lubricus organoid lines (n = 2 organoid lines derived from different individuals) were harvested in cell recovery solution (354253, Corning) to remove BME and fixed by chemical fixation using 3% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer. The fixation was followed by 1% osmium tetroxide plus 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide postfixation. Then, the organoids were dehydrated in series of ethanol and gradually embedded in Epon resin. Ultrathin sections were observed in a Tecnai Spirit T12 Electron Microscope equipped with an Eagle CCD camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Aspidelaps lubricus organoids were grown and differentiated as described above. For LC-MS analysis, a minimum of 500 μL of organoid containing BME (∼25 droplets) was harvested for protein extraction. In short, differentiation medium was removed and any residual liquid removed with PBS washes, organoids were collected and mechanically dissociated in 500 μL PBS using a glass Pasteur pipette in a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. Tubes were sonicated for 15 cycles (30 s on, 30 s off) using the Bioruptor Plus (Diagnode). Any leftover debris was spun down at 12,000 rpm, the supernatant collected, snap frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C.
For functional toxicity readout, a minimum of 500 μL of organoid containing BME was washed in the tissue culture plate with PBS and supplemented with C2C12 differentiation medium for two days prior to collection of supernatants. The same procedure was applied to harvest supernatant from human colon control organoid cultures as a negative control ( Sato et al., 2011 45. Sato, T. ∙ Stange, D.E. ∙ Ferrante, M. ... Long-term expansion of epithelial organoids from human colon, adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and Barrett’s epithelium Gastroenterology. 2011; 141 :1762-1772 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2617) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For comparison of A. l. cowlesi crude venom and organoid extracts, liquid chromatographic separation was performed with parallel at-line nanofractionation and mass spectrometry analysis. MS data of venom and organoid samples was analyzed for identical masses found in the samples to confirm production of venom toxins by organoids.
LC separation was performed using a Shimadzu UPLC system (‘s Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands), and a 250 × 4.6 mm Waters Xbridge Peptide BEH300 C18 analytical column with a 3,5-μm particle size combined with a 300-Å pore size. Separations were performed in a Shimadzu CTD-30A column oven at 30°C. Mobile phase A comprised of 98% H2O, 2% ACN and 0.1% FA, and mobile phase B comprised of 98% ACN, 2% H2O and 0.1% FA. A linear increase of mobile phase B from 0% to 50% in 20 min was followed by a linear increase from 50% to 90% B in 4 min and a 5 min isocratic separation at 90% B. The starting conditions were reached again in 1 min and the column was then equilibrated for 10 min at 0% B. A post-column flow split in 1:9 ratio directed the larger fraction to a FractioMateTM FRM100 nanofraction collector (SPARK-Holland & VU, Netherlands, Emmen & Amsterdam) or a modified Gilson 235P autosampler. To further confirm that venom toxins were present in the organoid extracts, crude organoid extracts were subjected to tryptic digestion after which these were analyzed with nanoLC-MS/MS. For this, 20 μL of each organoid sample was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 15 μl of digestion buffer (25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.2). Subsequently, 1.5 μl of reducing agent (0.5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to each tube followed by a 10-min incubation step at 95°C. Post incubation, the samples were cooled to room temperature and centrifuged at 150 RCF for 10 s in a Himac CT 15RE centrifuge. Next, 3 μL of alkylating agent (55 mM iodoacetamide) was added to the tubes before incubation in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Next, 3 μL of 0.1 μg/μL trypsin was added before incubation at 37°C for 3 h, and then an additional 3 μl of trypsin was added to the tubes and the samples were incubated overnight. Subsequently, 1 μL of 5% FA was added to quench the digestion, followed by brief centrifugation to remove any particulate matter. Finally, the samples were centrifuged for 10 s at 150 RCF and the supernatants were transferred to autosampler vials with glass inserts and analyzed with nanoLC-MS/MS. The data files obtained were run through the Mascot search engine (MASCOT; Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) against the Swiss-Prot, NCBInr database.
C2C12 cells were harvested and resuspended to obtain a cell suspension of 5,000 cells/μL in cold medium supplemented with 1:25 Matrigel-GFR (356231, Corning). The C2C12 cell suspension was seeded in the perfusion channel of an OrganoPlate 2-lane (9603-400B, Mimetas) against a collagen-I ECM gel as previously described ( Wevers et al., 2018 60. Wevers, N.R. ∙ Kasi, D.G. ∙ Gray, T. ... A perfused human blood-brain barrier on-a-chip for high-throughput assessment of barrier function and antibody transport Fluids Barriers CNS. 2018; 15 :23 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). The plate was incubated on a flat surface for 3 hours to allow cell attachment, after which medium perfusion was started with C2C12 differentiation medium composed of DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (26050-088, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 μM insulin (I9278, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. From day 2-5, the differentiation medium was supplemented with 10 μM cytarabine (C1768, Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit cell proliferation.
For cell viability assay, C2C12 cells were exposed for 30 minutes to supernatant from Aspidelaps lubricus venom gland organoids, supernatant from human colon organoids, recombinant alpha bungarotoxin and a killing control. After that exposure was terminated and fresh medium added for 24h and 48h. WST8 assay was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol to quantify cell viability.
Calcium imaging assays were performed at day 8 after plating. C2C12 myotubes in the OrganoPlate were incubated with 20 μM Cal-520 (ab171868, Abcam), 0.04% Pluronic-127 (P6866, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in C2C12 differentiation medium without serum for 60 minutes at 37°C, followed by 30 more minutes at RT. Next, cultures were exposed to C2C12 differentiation medium (negative control), human colon organoid supernatant (negative control), snake venom gland organoid supernatant or 10 μM α-bungarotoxin (positive control) for 30 minutes. Calcium imaging recordings were made using an ImageXpress Micro XLS-C Confocal High-Content Imaging System (Molecular Devices, wide field mode, 4x magnification, 2 Hz). An individual chip was imaged for 90 s to record baseline calcium activity. Myotubes in the chip were then exposed to 500 μM carbachol or vehicle (0.5% water) and immediately placed back in the microscope for another 90 s of calcium imaging to record the response to carbachol or vehicle. This pipeline was repeated for each chip.
The calcium imaging recordings were processed using scripts developed in Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 46. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recordings were corrected for camera-induced noise via Kalman Filtering and corrected for bleaching. Movement of fluorescent signal was quantified via Gaussian Window MSE resulting in RGB-encoded videos showing movement of fluorescent signal to the left and right side in purple and green, respectively. The colored areas were measured per time frame and averaged over time. All videos were processed to correct for flow-induced artifacts caused by movement of fluorescent cell debris. In the case of calcium wave propagation, movement was detected to a similar extent in both the left and right direction (< 2 fold difference) and the average area of the two directions was determined. In the case of flow of fluorescent debris, the movement detected in one direction is dominant over the other (> = 2 fold difference) and movement in the dominant direction was excluded.
Spontaneous electrical activity was recorded on the day of exposure (DIV9-11) as described previously ( Nicolas et al., 2014; Tukker et al., 2018 39. Nicolas, J. ∙ Hendriksen, P.J. ∙ van Kleef, R.G. ... Detection of marine neurotoxins in food safety testing using a multielectrode array Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2014; 58 :2369-2378 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Tukker, A.M. ∙ Wijnolts, F.M.J. ∙ de Groot, A. ... Human iPSC-derived neuronal models for in vitro neurotoxicity assessment Neurotoxicology. 2018; 67 :215-225 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, signals were recorded using a Maestro 768-channel amplifier with integrated heating system and temperature controller and a data acquisition interface (Axion BioSystems). Data acquisition was managed with Axion’s Integrated Studio (AxIS 2.4.2.13) and recorded as. RAW files. All channels were sampled at the same time with a gain of 1200x and a sampling frequency of 12.5kHz/channel with a 200-500 Hz band-pass filter. Prior to the recording, MEA plates were allowed to equilibrate for ∼10 min in the Maestro.
Spontaneous neuronal activity was recorded prior to exposure to generate a baseline recording. Immediately following this recording, cells were exposed to the test compounds (α-bungarotoxin, organoid supernatant and vehicle control) and activity was recorded for another 30 min. Each well was exposed to only one single concentration of one compound in order to prevent receptor (de)sensitization.
To determine (modulation of) spontaneous activity,. RAW data files were re-recorded to obtain Alpha Map files. In this re-recording, spikes were detected with the AxIS spike detector (Adaptive threshold crossing, Ada BandFIt v2) and a variable threshold spike detector set at 7x standard deviation (SD) of internal noise level (rms) on each electrode. Post/pre-spike duration was set to 3.6/2.4 ms respectively. For further data analysis, spike files were loaded in NeuralMetric Tool (version 2.2.4, Axion BioSystems) and only active electrodes (MSR ≥ 0.1 spikes/s) in active wells (≥1 active electrode) were included in data analysis. The effects of test compounds on spontaneous activity were determined by comparing the baseline activity with activity following exposure. A custom-made MS Excel macro was used to calculate treatment ratios (TR) per well for the mean spike rate, which were normalized to appropriate vehicle control.
For cell viability, rat cortical cells were cultured at a density of 3.0 × 104 cells/well. At DIV9-10, cells were exposed for 24 h to the test compounds, after which cell viability was assessed using a combined CFDA-AM / neutral red / alamar blue assay. In short, cells were incubated for 30 minutes with 12.5 mM alamar blue and 4 mM CFDA-AM in FBS at 37°C. Resorufin was measured spectrophotometrically at 540/590 nm (Infinite M200 microplate; Tecan), whereas hydrolyzed CFDA was measured spectrophotometrically at 493/541 nm. The aB/CFDA solution was then replaced by 200 mL neutral red solution (175 mM in PBS, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37°C. Next, cells were incubated for 30 min with 200 mL extraction solution (1% glacial acetic acid, 50% ethanol, and 49% H2O) during gentle shaking at room temperature. After 30 min extraction, fluorescence was measured spectrophotometrically at 530/645 nm.
RNA isolations of organoids and tissues for de-novo transcriptome assembly and bulk RNA sequencing were performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Organoid RNA isolations for quantitative PCR were performed with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using the SYBR Green and Bio-Rad systems. Changes in expression were calculated using CFX manager software (Bio-Rad). Primers were designed using NCBI primer design tool with the coding sequence of annotated scaffolds of interest as input. Primers used in this study are; ACTB, F_CTGGCCTAGGACACAGTACG,R_GCTCAGACTCCATTGCAACA LGR5 ,F_GTTCCCCTTCCTGCATGTCT,R_ACCAAACTAGCATCTTTTGCCTT ASCL2 ,F_CACTCGGCTTATTCGTCGGA,R_CTCCCGAACCAACTGGTGAA AXIN2 ,F_GATAGAAGCTGAGGCAGCCC,R_CCCCTTCGCATGTCCTCTAC RNF43 ,F_TTCCCATGAGTTCCATCGGC,R_GGCGGTACCTGATGTTGACT TCF7L2 ,F_GCTATCACCGGGCACTGTAG,R_GGTCCTCACGAGATTGCCTG MKI67 ,F_CAGGTGCATGAATCTGGTATTGAA,R_ATTTAGCGCTGCTTCTGTGACC 3FTX,F_ GTGGTGGTGACAATCGTGTG,R_GGTTGCGATGACTGTTGGTT KUN ,F_GTCCAGGACTCTGTGAACTGC,R_GCATTGTTTTGCAGCCAGGTT CTL ,F_TACACCCCAGGAACCCTTCT,R_TATTGGTGACGGAGACGCAC HSPA8 ,F_AGCAGTACAAAGCGGAGGAC,R_TCTGCCGTGCTCTTCATGTT
Sequencing and de-novo transcriptome assembly was performed by BaseClear B.V. as follows: PolyA enriched RNA from liver tissue, pancreas tissue, venom gland tissue, organoids early passage, organoids late passage expansion and organoids late passage differentiation was sequenced. Paired-end sequence reads were generated using the Illumina HiSeq2500 system. FASTQ sequence files were generated using bcl2fastq2 version 2.18. Initial quality assessment was based on data passing the Illumina Chastity filtering. Subsequently, reads containing PhiX control signal were removed using an in-house filtering protocol. The second quality assessment was based on the remaining reads using the FASTQC quality control tool version 0.11.5. The transcriptome assembly was performed with Trinity (version 2.4.0) ( Haas et al., 2013 25. Haas, B.J. ∙ Papanicolaou, A. ∙ Yassour, M. ... De novo transcript sequence reconstruction from RNA-seq using the Trinity platform for reference generation and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1494-1512 Crossref Scopus (5749) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the combined data of all six samples. The resulting consensus assembly was filtered to remove all sequences shorter than 500bp, resulting in 311,948 remaining scaffolds. These were aligned with BLASTN (version 2.6.0) against a local copy of the NCBI-NT database (built in February 2018). Toxin-encoding contigs were validated by manual sequence analysis (e.g., ORF identification) of those exhibiting annotations consistent with known snake venom toxin proteins.
Bulk RNA sequencing of N. nivea was performed by the Utrecht Sequencing Facility (uSeq) as follows: Libraries were prepared based on polyA enrichment. Paired-end sequence reads were generated using the NextSeq500 system.
For organoid single cell RNA sequencing, A. l. cowlesi organoids were grown and differentiated as described above. BME was removed by washing in ice-cold DMEM (GIBCO). For tissue sequencing, embryonic A. l. cowlesi venom glands were dissociated with collagenase I as described above and subsequently processed in the same way as organoids. Organoids or tissue fragments were resuspended in TrypLE Express (GIBCO) pre-heated to 32°C and dissociated under repeated pipetting. Upon reaching single cell state, samples were pelleted, washed, resuspended in FACS buffer (advanced DMEM, 10 mM Y-27632 and DAPI) and strained (35 μm). Cells were immediately sorted into 384-well plates containing ERCC spike-ins (Agilent), RT primers and dNTP (Promega) using a BD FACSJazz (BD Biosciences). Plates were prepared using Mosquito HTS (TTPlabtech). scRNA-seq libraries were prepared following the SORT-seq protocol ( Muraro et al., 2016 38. Muraro, M.J. ∙ Dharmadhikari, G. ∙ Grun, D. ... A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :385-394 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is based on the CEL-seq2 method ( Hashimshony et al., 2016 27. Hashimshony, T. ∙ Senderovich, N. ∙ Avital, G. ... CEL-Seq2: sensitive highly-multiplexed single-cell RNA-Seq Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :77 Crossref Scopus (725) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were first lysed for 5 min at 65 °C, and RT and second-strand mixes were dispensed by the Nanodrop II liquid handling platform (GC Biotech). Single-cell double-stranded cDNAs were pooled together and in vitro transcribed for linear amplification. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq small RNA primers (Illumina) and these DNA libraries were sequenced paired-end at 60 and 26 bp read length, respectively, on the Illumina NextSeq.
Bulk paired-end reads of A. l. cowlesi and N. nivea tissue and organoids were mapped to the de novo assembled A. l. cowlesi transcriptome using STAR. When a read mapped to multiple scaffolds, a fractional count of 1/x was recorded, where x is the number of scaffolds the read maps to. To reduce the complexity of the count table, scaffolds with identical blast hits were merged by summation of their transcript counts. All scripts used for read counting are deposited at https://github.com/BuysDB/reptilianOrganoids . For single cell analysis, paired-end reads were demultiplexed on the cell barcode and UMI and adapters trimmed using Cutadapt 2. Next, the reads were mapped and counted as described for the bulk samples, additionally we removed amplification duplicates by UMI-scaffold combinations. Scaffold annotations were filtered to exclude the terms (“mitochondrial,” “mitochondrion,” “ribosomal,” “rRNA,” “ribosomal,” “microsatellite,” “transposon,” “SINE,” “LINE repeat,” “noBlast”) and requiring them to be detected in at least 2 cells, resulting in 42,507 unique annotations. Subsequently, cells were filtered by requiring at least 2000 counts and at least 100 different genes to be expressed, leaving 1,092 cells (1,255 for tissue) to be included for dimensionality reduction and k-medoids-based clustering using RaceID3 according to the vignette ( Herman et al., 2018 28. Herman, J.S. ∙ Sagar ∙ Grün, D. FateID infers cell fate bias in multipotent progenitors from single-cell RNA-seq data Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :379-386 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ), starting with an expected cluster number of 10 (organoid) and 20 (tissue). Violin plots were generated using Seurat functions ( Butler et al., 2018 7. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6218) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 3.0.0.9000) on the dataset analyzed by RaceID3. Single cell trajectories were analyzed using Monocle (version 2.6.4) ( Trapnell et al., 2014 53. Trapnell, C. ∙ Cacchiarelli, D. ∙ Grimsby, J. ... The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (3552) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, genes were selected as input features based on differential expression between expansion and differentiation medium and dimensionality was reduced for display using reverse graph embedding.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to the sample allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), unless stated otherwise.
