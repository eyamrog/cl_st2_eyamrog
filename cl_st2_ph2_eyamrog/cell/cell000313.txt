Title: A role of PIEZO1 in iron metabolism in mice and humans


Abstract: Summary

Iron overload causes progressive organ damage and is associated with arthritis, liver damage, and heart failure. Elevated iron levels are present in 1%–5% of individuals; however, iron overload is undermonitored and underdiagnosed. Genetic factors affecting iron homeostasis are emerging. Individuals with hereditary xerocytosis, a rare disorder with gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in mechanosensitive PIEZO1 ion channel, develop age-onset iron overload. We show that constitutive or macrophage expression of a GOF Piezo1 allele in mice disrupts levels of the iron regulator hepcidin and causes iron overload. We further show that PIEZO1 is a key regulator of macrophage phagocytic activity and subsequent erythrocyte turnover. Strikingly, we find that E756del, a mild GOF PIEZO1 allele present in one-third of individuals of African descent, is strongly associated with increased plasma iron. Our study links macrophage mechanotransduction to iron metabolism and identifies a genetic risk factor for increased iron levels in African Americans.

Section: Introduction

Iron is essential for cellular processes such as hemoglobin biosynthesis for oxygen transport. However, too much iron is toxic to organs ( Dabbagh et al., 1993 17.

Cardiol. 2010; 56 :1001-1012 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Milic et al., 2016 45. Milic, S. ∙ Mikolasevic, I. ∙ Orlic, L. ... The role of iron and iron overload in chronic liver disease Med. Sci. Monit. 2016; 22 :2144-2151 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, iron levels are tightly controlled by homeostatic processes ( Fleming and Ponka, 2012 21. Fleming, R.E. ∙ Ponka, P. Iron overload in human disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :348-359 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ganz, 2013 24. Ganz, T. Systemic iron homeostasis Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93 :1721-1741 Crossref Scopus (832) PubMed Google Scholar ). Iron homeostasis involves the action of multiple cell types, and key players include enterocytes, red blood cells (RBCs), macrophages, and hepatocytes. Many pathways involved in iron metabolism are emerging ( Andrews and Ganz, 2019 4. Andrews, N.C. ∙ Ganz, T. The molecular basis of iron metabolism Provan, D. ∙ Gribben, J. (Editors) Molecular Hematology, 4 th Edition Wiley, 2019; 161-172 Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar ). However, the genetic factors that predispose people to iron overload are not well understood.
The majority of circulating iron is derived from recycling of RBCs, which contain hemoglobin, the primary iron reservoir. Macrophages in the spleen and liver clear senescent RBCs via phagocytosis and release iron from heme after chemical breakdown of hemoglobin ( Ganz, 2012 23. Ganz, T. Macrophages and systemic iron homeostasis J. Innate Immun. 2012; 4 :446-453 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). This highly dynamic process recycles ∼25 mg of iron per day and accounts for the vast majority of total serum iron in the blood ( Korolnek and Hamza, 2015 40. Korolnek, T. ∙ Hamza, I. Macrophages and iron trafficking at the birth and death of red cells Blood. 2015; 125 :2893-2897 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fleming and Ponka, 2012 21. Fleming, R.E. ∙ Ponka, P. Iron overload in human disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :348-359 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, enterocytes of the small intestine absorb 1–2 mg of dietary iron per day, so iron absorption in the digestive tract accounts for only 5%–10% of total iron in the bloodstream ( Fleming and Ponka, 2012 21. Fleming, R.E. ∙ Ponka, P. Iron overload in human disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :348-359 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Many of the key players in regulating iron homeostasis have been identified. Transferrin is a blood plasma protein that binds and transports circulating iron into tissues via transferrin-receptor-mediated endocytosis ( Gomme et al., 2005 27. Gomme, P.T. ∙ McCann, K.B. ∙ Bertolini, J. Transferrin: structure, function and potential therapeutic actions Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10 :267-273 Crossref Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ). Once internalized into cells, iron is bound by ferritin, a protein that sequesters iron. Since ferritin is also secreted extracellularly, serum ferritin levels are also used as a clinical marker for total body iron store ( Knovich et al., 2009 39. Knovich, M.A. ∙ Storey, J.A. ∙ Coffman, L.G. ... Ferritin for the clinician Blood Rev. 2009; 23 :95-104 Crossref Scopus (459) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hepatocytes in the liver are the major iron storage sites and important sensors of iron levels. In response to elevated iron in the liver, hepatocytes transcribe a gene encoding the peptide hormone hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism ( Park et al., 2001 52. Park, C.H. ∙ Valore, E.V. ∙ Waring, A.J. ... Hepcidin, a urinary antimicrobial peptide synthesized in the liver J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :7806-7810 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1869) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ganz, 2011 22. Ganz, T. Hepcidin and iron regulation, 10 years later Blood. 2011; 117 :4425-4433 Crossref Scopus (770) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hepcidin suppresses the release of iron from enterocytes and macrophages into the blood by downregulating iron transporter ferroportin activity ( Donovan et al., 2005 19. Donovan, A. ∙ Lima, C.A. ∙ Pinkus, J.L. ... The iron exporter ferroportin/Slc40a1 is essential for iron homeostasis Cell Metab. 2005; 1 :191-200 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (981) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ganz and Nemeth, 2012a 25. Ganz, T. ∙ Nemeth, E. Iron metabolism: interactions with normal and disordered erythropoiesis Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2 :a011668 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). In principle, iron overload can result from disruption of any step of these multicellular processes. People suspected to have iron overload receive laboratory blood tests for transferrin and ferritin, but accurate clinical diagnosis of iron overload requires an expensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan ( Fleming and Ponka, 2012 21. Fleming, R.E. ∙ Ponka, P. Iron overload in human disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :348-359 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the treatment for iron overload is limited to two elementary therapeutic options, phlebotomy and iron chelation, and their effectiveness is limited by high costs and a wide range of side effects ( Mobarra et al., 2016 46. Mobarra, N. ∙ Shanaki, M. ∙ Ehteram, H. ... A review on iron chelators in treatment of iron overload syndromes Int. J. Hematol. Oncol. Stem Cell Res. 2016; 10 :239-247 PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, iron overload is underdiagnosed and has a dearth of treatment options.
Iron overload can have genetic or iatrogenic (e.g., from blood transfusions) origins. Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited form of iron overload, with ∼1 million people affected in the United States ( Brissot et al., 2018 9. Brissot, P. ∙ Pietrangelo, A. ∙ Adams, P.C. ... Haemochromatosis Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2018; 4 :18016 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is most frequently caused by mutations in the HFE gene, encoding the human hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE) ( Feder et al., 1996 20. Feder, J.N. ∙ Gnirke, A. ∙ Thomas, W. ... A novel MHC class I-like gene is mutated in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis Nat. Genet. 1996; 13 :399-408 Crossref Scopus (3427) PubMed Google Scholar ). HFE interacts with transferrin receptors to regulate transferrin-bound iron uptake and hepcidin expression ( Roy et al., 1999 61. Roy, C.N. ∙ Penny, D.M. ∙ Feder, J.N. ... The hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, specifically regulates transferrin-mediated iron uptake in HeLa cells J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :9022-9028 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). The HFE C282Y allele is the most prevalent mutation associated with iron overload; 10% of individuals of northern European descent are C282Y heterozygotes, and 0.3%–0.5% are homozygotes. A large-scale study found that C282Y homozygosity, but not heterozygosity, is associated with elevated transferrin saturation and ferritin, indicating higher risks for iron overload ( Adams et al., 2005 1. Adams, P.C. ∙ Reboussin, D.M. ∙ Barton, J.C. ..., Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study Research Investigators Hemochromatosis and iron-overload screening in a racially diverse population N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352 :1769-1778 Crossref Scopus (621) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent study found that C282Y carriers have higher risks for multi-organ complications such as diabetes, obesity, and arthritis ( Pilling et al., 2019 57. Pilling, L.C. ∙ Tamosauskaite, J. ∙ Jones, G. ... Common conditions associated with hereditary haemochromatosis genetic variants: cohort study in UK Biobank BMJ. 2019; 364 :k5222 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the C282Y allele cannot account for high serum iron in people of non-European ancestry. For example, studies have suggested that ∼5% or 10% of individuals of African descent have high transferrin saturation levels and high serum ferritin respectively, but the frequency of C282Y homozygosity in African populations is extremely low at 0.01% ( Adams et al., 2005 1. Adams, P.C. ∙ Reboussin, D.M. ∙ Barton, J.C. ..., Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study Research Investigators Hemochromatosis and iron-overload screening in a racially diverse population N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352 :1769-1778 Crossref Scopus (621) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, unknown genetic factors play important but unrecognized roles in iron overload in African populations.
Mechanisms beyond HFE and the transferrin pathway could contribute to iron metabolism deficiencies in humans. For example, iron overload is sometimes a complication of other blood disorders. Indeed, hemoglobin deficits in β-thalassemia patients cause iron overload secondary to RBC defects, irrespective of whether these individuals receive blood transfusions ( Hershko, 2010 32. Hershko, C. Pathogenesis and management of iron toxicity in thalassemia Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2010; 1202 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ; Taher and Saliba, 2017 67. Taher, A.T. ∙ Saliba, A.N. Iron overload in thalassemia: different organs at different rates Hematology (Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program). 2017; 2017 :265-271 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, iron overload was also observed in patients with hereditary xerocytosis (HX), another blood disorder that causes RBC dehydration with mild hemolysis ( Andolfo et al., 2020 3. Andolfo, I. ∙ Rosato, B.E. ∙ Manna, F. ... Gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO1 directly impair hepatic iron metabolism via the inhibition of the BMP/SMADs pathway Am. J.

Clinical and biological features in PIEZO1 -hereditary xerocytosis and Gardos channelopathy: a retrospective series of 126 patients Haematologica. 2019; 104 :1554-1564 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, HX is associated with gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO1, a mechanically activated nonselective cation channel ( Coste et al., 2010 14. Coste, B. ∙ Mathur, J. ∙ Schmidt, M. ... Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1967) PubMed Google Scholar ; Albuisson et al., 2013 2.

Mutations in the mechanotransduction protein PIEZO1 are associated with hereditary xerocytosis Blood. 2012; 120 :1908-1915 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ). PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are crucial mechanotransducers in vertebrates. PIEZO2 is the principal mechanosensitive channel responsible for touch, proprioception, and baroreception ( Ranade et al., 2014 58. Ranade, S.S. ∙ Qiu, Z. ∙ Woo, S.-H. ... Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel, is required for vascular development in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PIEZOs mediate neuronal sensing of blood pressure and the baroreceptor reflex Science. 2018; 362 :464-467 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ), while PIEZO1 plays an essential role in cardiovascular development, RBC cell volume, and bone formation ( Ranade et al., 2014 58.

The association between HX and iron overload, combined with our recent discovery of GOF mutations in PIEZO1 in HX, presented the opportunity to investigate whether PIEZO1 directly participates in iron homeostasis, aside from its known roles in RBC physiology. Moreover, a common PIEZO1 GOF mutation (E756del) previously identified by our group is observed in up to one-third of individuals of west African descent from different geographic regions and is associated with a mild form of RBC dehydration ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). The prevalence of this allele in most African populations raises the possibility that iron overload observed in rare HX patients is also relevant to a much larger population and provides us with a large pool of individuals to study the effect of GOF PIEZO1 in iron homeostasis. We therefore investigated the link between GOF PIEZO1 and iron overload in a mouse model of HX ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; Picard et al., 2019 56. Picard, V. ∙ Guitton, C. ∙ Thuret, I. ... Clinical and biological features in PIEZO1 -hereditary xerocytosis and Gardos channelopathy: a retrospective series of 126 patients Haematologica. 2019; 104 :1554-1564 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Is iron overload merely a consequence of RBC dehydration in HX, or does PIEZO1 in other cell types contribute to iron homeostasis? In this work, we combine mouse and human genetics to answer these questions.

Section: Results

Previously, we generated mice that express a Cre-dependent human-equivalent GOF PIEZO1 allele and showed that these transgenic mice model HX, a rare blood disorder primarily characterized by dehydrated RBCs ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aging HX patients develop iron overload ( Andolfo et al., 2020 3. Andolfo, I. ∙ Rosato, B.E. ∙ Manna, F. ... Gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO1 directly impair hepatic iron metabolism via the inhibition of the BMP/SMADs pathway Am. J. Hematol. 2020; 95 :188-197 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Picard et al., 2019 56. Picard, V. ∙ Guitton, C. ∙ Thuret, I. ... Clinical and biological features in PIEZO1 -hereditary xerocytosis and Gardos channelopathy: a retrospective series of 126 patients Haematologica. 2019; 104 :1554-1564 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we first tested if the constitutive GOF Piezo1 mice also develop age-onset iron overload ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schwenk et al., 1995 62. Schwenk, F. ∙ Baron, U. ∙ Rajewsky, K. A cre-transgenic mouse strain for the ubiquitous deletion of loxP-flanked gene segments including deletion in germ cells Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23 :5080-5081 Crossref Scopus (1065) PubMed Google Scholar ). A hallmark of iron overload is the presence of excessive iron in the liver ( Fleming and Ponka, 2012 21. Fleming, R.E. ∙ Ponka, P. Iron overload in human disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :348-359 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed a histological analysis of liver with Perls Prussian blue, which detects iron ( Parmley et al., 1978 53. Parmley, R.T. ∙ Spicer, S.S. ∙ Alvarez, C.J. Ultrastructural localization of nonheme celluar iron with ferrocyanide J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26 :729-741 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Iron staining was observed in hepatocytes of constitutive heterozygous GOF Piezo1 aging mice (over 1 year old); interestingly, even higher levels were detected in liver Kupffer cells (macrophages) ( Figure 1 A). As expected, no staining was observed in wild-type littermates ( Figure 1 A). Iron deposition was more severe in homozygous GOF Piezo1 mice than in heterozygous mice ( Figure 1 A). We next used an enzymatic assay to quantify iron levels in liver extracts. As expected, we found that aging wild-type mice had minimal liver iron levels; however, aging GOF Piezo1 mice had elevated levels ( Figure 1 B, right of the dashed line). Consistent with the histological analysis, homozygote livers had substantially higher liver iron levels compared to heterozygotes ( Figure 1 B). Interestingly, we found that heterozygous or homozygous young adult GOF Piezo1 mice (2–5 months old) did not show increased liver iron content compared to wild-type controls ( Figure 1 B, left of the dashed line).
In addition to excessive iron storage in liver, iron overload is associated with elevated serum iron levels. We measured the serum iron concentration in both aging and young adult mice. We found that aging GOF Piezo1 mice had significantly higher serum iron concentration than wild-type controls, with homozygotes more severely affected than heterozygotes ( Figure 1 C). Similar to liver iron accumulation, we found that serum iron elevation did not occur in young adult GOF Piezo1 mice ( Figure 1 C).
Transferrin saturation, measured as a percentage, is the serum iron amount divided by the total iron-binding capacity of the available transferrin, reflects how much serum iron is bound by transferrin and correlates with the serum iron level ( Fleming and Ponka, 2012 21. Fleming, R.E. ∙ Ponka, P. Iron overload in human disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :348-359 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to findings with total serum iron concentrations, we found that aging GOF Piezo1 mice, but not young adults, had significantly higher transferrin saturation values ( Figure 1 D). Finally, ferritin concentration in the blood reflects the amount of iron stored in the body and, together with transferrin saturation, serves as a provisional test for iron overload ( Jensen, 2004 36. Jensen, P.-D. Evaluation of iron overload Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 124 :697-711 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Once again, we found that only aging GOF Piezo1 mice had significantly increased ferritin levels ( Figure 1 E). Therefore, we show with combined evidence from liver iron accumulation, serum iron levels, transferrin saturation, and ferritin concentration that GOF Piezo1 mice fully recapitulate the age-onset iron overload phenotype observed in the rare HX patients. Therefore, our transgenic model provides a useful tool for further investigation of how PIEZO1 contributes to iron metabolism.
We next sought to elucidate the cell type in which GOF PIEZO1 expression causes iron overload. Blood iron level is tightly controlled by interplay among RBCs, macrophages, and hepatocytes ( Fleming and Ponka, 2012 21. Fleming, R.E. ∙ Ponka, P. Iron overload in human disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :348-359 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ; Muckenthaler et al., 2017 47. Muckenthaler, M.U. ∙ Rivella, S. ∙ Hentze, M.W. ... A red carpet for iron metabolism Cell. 2017; 168 :344-361 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (871) PubMed Google Scholar ). PIEZO1 is not highly expressed in hepatocytes in mice ( Figure S1 A) but is robustly expressed in RBCs ( Cahalan et al., 2015 11. Cahalan, S.M. ∙ Lukacs, V. ∙ Ranade, S.S. ... Piezo1 links mechanical forces to red blood cell volume eLife. 2015; 4 :e07370 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ) and macrophages ( Solis et al., 2019 63. Solis, A.G. ∙ Bielecki, P. ∙ Steach, H.R. ... Mechanosensation of cyclical force by PIEZO1 is essential for innate immunity Nature. 2019; 573 :69-74 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 B); we therefore tested the requirement of GOF PIEZO1 in these two cell types. Since RBCs are the major reservoirs for iron in the form of hemoglobin and iron overload often accompanies RBC disorders ( Taher and Saliba, 2017 67. Taher, A.T. ∙ Saliba, A.N. Iron overload in thalassemia: different organs at different rates Hematology (Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program). 2017; 2017 :265-271 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ), we initially suspected that the iron overload phenotype observed in GOF Piezo1 mice is secondary to RBC dehydration. To test this, we analyzed mice expressing GOF PIEZO1 only in RBCs ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; Heinrich et al., 2004 31. Heinrich, A.C. ∙ Pelanda, R. ∙ Klingmüller, U. A mouse model for visualization and conditional mutations in the erythroid lineage Blood. 2004; 104 :659-666 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, we found that aging heterozygous RBC-specific GOF Piezo1 mice did not accumulate noticeable iron deposits in the liver ( Figure 2 A, left panels). In addition, aging heterozygous and homozygous RBC-specific GOF Piezo1 mice had liver iron levels similar to wild-type controls ( Figure 2 B, left of the dashed line). Consistently, serum iron levels, transferrin saturation, and ferritin concentrations were all normal in aging RBC-specific GOF Piezo1 mice ( Figures 2 C–2E, left of the dashed lines). The evidence from liver and serum iron suggests that RBC dehydration is unlikely to be the main cause for late-onset iron overload in the HX animal model.
Macrophages are phagocytic cells that play diverse homeostatic roles in addition to their well-known contributions to the innate immune system. Specialized tissue-resident macrophages of the liver and spleen phagocytose senescent RBCs and subsequently break down hemoglobin to release iron into the bloodstream ( Ganz, 2012 23. Ganz, T. Macrophages and systemic iron homeostasis J. Innate Immun. 2012; 4 :446-453 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). This recycling process converts stored iron into a bioavailable form. PIEZO1-dependent mechanosensation in macrophages has been previously implicated in innate immunity in the lung ( Solis et al., 2019 63. Solis, A.G. ∙ Bielecki, P. ∙ Steach, H.R. ... Mechanosensation of cyclical force by PIEZO1 is essential for innate immunity Nature. 2019; 573 :69-74 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ), but its role in phagocytosis or homeostatic functions of macrophages is wholly unknown. We tested mice expressing GOF PIEZO1 in macrophages by using LysM-Cre, which targets myeloid cells ( Clausen et al., 1999 12. Clausen, B.E. ∙ Burkhardt, C. ∙ Reith, W. ... Conditional gene targeting in macrophages and granulocytes using LysMcre mice Transgenic Res. 1999; 8 :265-277 Crossref Scopus (1731) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, we observed increased iron deposition in the livers (both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells) of aging macrophage-specific Piezo1 GOF mice that was more pronounced in homozygotes than in heterozygotes ( Figure 2 A, middle and right panels). Our quantitative analysis showed that liver iron content from aging macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice was indistinguishable from constitutive GOF Piezo1 mice for both heterozygotes and homozygotes ( Figures 1 B and 2 B, right of the dashed lines). In addition, serum iron levels, transferrin saturation, and ferritin concentration in aging macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice were all elevated compared to aging wild-type littermate controls ( Figures 2 C–2E, right of the dashed lines). Importantly, these serum iron measurements in macrophage-specific Piezo1 mice are comparable to the values observed in mice constitutively expressing GOF PIEZO1 (compare Figures 2 C–2E to Figures 1 C–1E).
We also tested if macrophages with overactive PIEZO1 indirectly cause iron disorder via RBC abnormalities. Whole blood count analysis showed that macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice had normal RBC numbers, hematocrit (HCT), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and volume (MCV) ( Figure S2 ). Thus, GOF PIEZO1 in macrophages is unlikely to induce RBC damage. Together, our study of RBC- and macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice suggests that GOF PIEZO1-induced iron overload is due to its action in macrophages and not in RBCs. Although LysM-Cre targets all myeloid cells, GOF PIEZO1 is likely to cause iron overload via actions in macrophages, which have well-established functions in iron metabolism.
The small peptide hormone hepcidin is a key regulator of iron metabolism in mammals ( Ganz, 2011 22. Ganz, T. Hepcidin and iron regulation, 10 years later Blood. 2011; 117 :4425-4433 Crossref Scopus (770) PubMed Google Scholar ). Secreted hepcidin protein from hepatocytes suppresses the release of iron into the blood, and chronically reduced hepcidin levels induce iron overload ( Papanikolaou et al., 2005 51. Papanikolaou, G. ∙ Tzilianos, M. ∙ Christakis, J.I. ... Hepcidin in iron overload disorders Blood. 2005; 105 :4103-4105 Crossref Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that hepcidin transcript levels in liver extracts were dramatically reduced in aging macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice ( Figure 3 A). In addition, we found that serum hepcidin protein concentration was significantly lower in aging macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice compared to wild-type littermates when measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Figure 3 B). Interestingly, we detected a statistically significant reduction in both liver hepcidin transcript levels and serum hepcidin protein concentration in young adult macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice ( Figure 3 C and 3D), although this decrease was less dramatic than what was observed in aging mice. These data indicate that compromised hepcidin levels in young adult mice (which have normal iron levels) precede iron overload in aging GOF mice and suggest that dysregulation of the hepcidin pathway is a key instigator of iron overload in the HX model.
The temporal relationship between hepcidin reduction and the presence of iron overload also suggests that the age-onset iron overload might be due to continued dysregulation of iron metabolism throughout adulthood. To test this possibility, we challenged young adult mice with acute iron stress. We performed a single intraperitoneal injection of iron dextran at 40 μg/g body weight in adult mice ( Zhang et al., 2011 73. Zhang, Z. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ An, P. ... Ferroportin1 deficiency in mouse macrophages impairs iron homeostasis and inflammatory responses Blood. 2011; 118 :1912-1922 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). This single-dose treatment was not sufficient to alter serum iron levels, transferrin saturation, or ferritin concentration in young adult wild-type mice after 24 h ( Figures 4 A–4C). In contrast, all tested blood parameters were elevated in heterozygous constitutive GOF Piezo1 mice after a single injection ( Figures 4 A–4C). Importantly, macrophage-, but not RBC-specific, GOF Piezo1 mice fully phenocopied the increased serum iron levels, transferrin saturation, and ferritin concentration observed in constitutive GOF Piezo1 mice in response to iron stress ( Figures 4 A–4C). These results indicate that overactive PIEZO1 in macrophages not only causes iron overload in aging mice but also disrupts the acute response to excessive iron in young adult mice.
Next, we tested whether hepcidin levels are associated with the observed acute iron dysregulation. We found that acute iron stress significantly increased liver hepcidin transcript levels and serum hepcidin protein concentration in adult wild-type mice, as expected ( Figures 4 D and S3 ). However, there was no significant increase in hepcidin transcript or protein in macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 adult mice ( Figures 4 D and S3 ), indicating that hepcidin induction is impaired in macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice. Therefore, the acute iron stress experiment suggests that mice with overactive PIEZO1 in macrophages develop age-onset iron overload due to chronically impaired iron regulation during adulthood.
How does overactive PIEZO1 in macrophages affect hepcidin levels? Hepcidin coordinates iron metabolism to meet the demand for RBC production ( Pasricha et al., 2016 54. Pasricha, S.-R. ∙ McHugh, K. ∙ Drakesmith, H. Regulation of hepcidin by erythropoiesis: the story so far Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2016; 36 :417-434 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ganz and Nemeth, 2012b 26. Ganz, T. ∙ Nemeth, E. Hepcidin and iron homeostasis Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823 :1434-1443 Crossref Scopus (983) PubMed Google Scholar ); it is downregulated during increased erythropoiesis to ensure sufficient iron availability for new hemoglobin synthesis. We hypothesized that GOF PIEZO1 in macrophages increases erythropoiesis, which inhibits hepcidin production. Indeed, despite normal mature RBC properties ( Figure S2 ), macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice had a significantly higher reticulocyte count ( Figure 5 A), an indicator of enhanced erythropoiesis. Erythroferrone, produced from bone marrow and the spleen, is a hormone that downregulates liver hepcidin expression during enhanced erythropoiesis ( Kautz et al., 2014 37. Kautz, L. ∙ Jung, G. ∙ Valore, E.V. ... Identification of erythroferrone as an erythroid regulator of iron metabolism Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :678-684 Crossref Scopus (873) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kautz et al., 2015 38. Kautz, L. ∙ Jung, G. ∙ Du, X. ... Erythroferrone contributes to hepcidin suppression and iron overload in a mouse model of β-thalassemia Blood. 2015; 126 :2031-2037 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, we observed that serum erythroferrone levels were significantly increased in adult macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice compared to the almost undetectable levels found in wild-type mice ( Figure 5 B). Thus, macrophages with overactive PIEZO1 enhance erythropoiesis and increase erythroferrone to reduce hepcidin expression.
A higher reticulocyte but normal mature RBC count suggests a chronically increased RBC turnover rate (i.e., due to enhanced phagocytosis of RBCs) in macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice. To test the in vivo rate of RBC turnover via phagocytosis, we measured the half-life of RBCs using a pulse-chase experiment. We intravenously injected 5 × 10 7 fluorescently labeled RBCs into adult mice (equivalent to ∼1%–2% of the total RBC content of whole blood), collected blood samples at specific time points over several weeks, and measured the number of labeled RBCs by flow cytometry. The number of labeled RBCs declines over time as the cells age and are cleared from the circulation by phagocytosing macrophages ( Dholakia et al., 2015 18. Dholakia, U. ∙ Bandyopadhyay, S. ∙ Hod, E.A. ... Determination of RBC survival in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-Tg(UBC-GFP) mice Comp. Med. 2015; 65 :196-201 PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 A). The number of fluorescent RBCs declined over a 3-week period in adult wild-type mice to about 50% of initial levels ( Figure 5 C, black line). Strikingly, labeled RBCs in macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice declined significantly faster than in wild-type and decreased to almost undetectable levels by the end of the three-week period ( Figure 5 C, blue line). Labeled RBCs had a half-life of ∼20 days in adult wild-type mice compared to 10 days in macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice ( Figure S4 A). Our in vivo RBC turnover analysis indicates that macrophages with overactive PIEZO1 recycle more RBCs over a given time period. Indeed, we found that splenic macrophages (F4/80 + ) from macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice contained significantly higher amounts of intracellular RBCs (Ter119 + ) than wild-type (Q2 in Figures 5 D and 5E), suggesting that macrophages with GOF PIEZO1 have an increased RBC phagocytic activity in vivo . As expected, we observed an increase in total TER-119 + cells (Q2 + Q3 in Figure 5 D), since spleen is an important site for stress erythropoiesis in mice and TER-119 also labels erythroid progenitors ( Paulson et al., 2011 55. Paulson, R.F. ∙ Shi, L. ∙ Wu, D.-C. Stress erythropoiesis: new signals and new stress progenitor cells Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2011; 18 :139-145 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Then, we directly tested whether macrophages with overactive PIEZO1 have enhanced phagocytosis activity. We cultured bone-marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type and macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice and incubated them with fluorescent zymosan particles, a protein-carbohydrate complex from yeast cell walls that triggers phagocytosis and is engulfed by macrophages ( Figure S4 B). We found that fluorescence intensity (normalized to cell number) was significantly higher within GOF Piezo1 macrophages than within wild-type macrophages ( Figures 5 F and S4 B), suggesting that overactive PIEZO1 activity enhances general phagocytosis process. To test whether overactive PIEZO1 increases phagocytosis of RBCs specifically (hemophagocytosis), we used a quantitative assay to measure phagocytic activity for opsonized RBCs. We observed a significant increase in phagocytosed RBC antigens in macrophages with GOF PIEZO1 ( Figure 5 G), consistent with in vivo data that overactive PIEZO1 in macrophages increases hemophagocytosis ( Figures 5 D and 5E).
Calcium signaling is important in phagocytosis ( Nunes and Demaurex, 2010 50. Nunes, P. ∙ Demaurex, N. The role of calcium signaling in phagocytosis J. Leukoc. Biol. 2010; 88 :57-68 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gronski et al., 2009 28. Gronski, M.A. ∙ Kinchen, J.M. ∙ Juncadella, I.J. ... An essential role for calcium flux in phagocytes for apoptotic cell engulfment and the anti-inflammatory response Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16 :1323-1331 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since activated PIEZO1 conducts calcium, we hypothesized that GOF PIEZO1 induces larger intracellular calcium influx in macrophages compared to wild type. Indeed, Yoda1, a PIEZO1-specific agonist, induced larger calcium transients in macrophages with GOF PIEZO1 ( Figure S4 C). Rac1, a small GTPase that can be activated by calcium ( Cook-Mills et al., 2004 13. Cook-Mills, J.M. ∙ Johnson, J.D. ∙ Deem, T.L. ... Calcium mobilization and Rac1 activation are required for VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) stimulation of NADPH oxidase activity Biochem. J. 2004; 378 :539-547 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ), is crucial for phagocytosis via regulating cytoskeletal organization ( Mao and Finnemann, 2015 43. Mao, Y. ∙ Finnemann, S.C. Regulation of phagocytosis by Rho GTPases Small GTPases. 2015; 6 :89-99 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used a quantitative assay to measure active Rac1 in macrophages during phagocytosis ( Figure S4 D). We observed a significantly elevated active Rac1 levels in GOF Piezo1 macrophages when co-cultured with opsonized RBCs ( Figure 5 H). Interestingly, we observed increased Rac1 activation in GOF Piezo1 macrophages before enhanced phagocytosis (compare time courses in Figures 5 G and 5H), suggesting that increased Rac1 activity could cause the increased phagocytosis. Further, immunocytochemistry with a validated antibody against active Rac1 ( Figure S4 E) showed a similar elevation in active Rac1 in GOF Piezo1 macrophages during phagocytosis ( Figure 5 I). Therefore, our data provide a potential mechanism of how excessive mechanotransduction in macrophages affects phagocytosis via calcium and Rac1 activation.
To evaluate how overactive PIEZO1 might also affect other macrophage phenotypes in vivo , we first examined developmental trajectory of GOF Piezo1 macrophages. We found no significant changes for cell-surface markers that define different types of macrophages ( Figure S5 A), suggesting that GOF PIEZO1 is unlikely to change macrophage development in a dramatic way. Further, we examined gene expression of key cytokines and interleukins in splenic macrophages and did not identify obvious changes between wild-type and macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice ( Figure S5 B). Consistently, we did not observe a change in inflammatory molecules in the serum of macrophage-specific GOF Piezo1 mice ( Figure S5 C). Together, these data suggest that overactive PIEZO1 in macrophages can increase erythrocyte turnover as a direct result of enhanced hemophagocytosis.
We have established that overactive PIEZO1 in macrophages causes increased phagocytosis and reduced response to acute iron stress. However, these data do not directly address whether endogenous PIEZO1 is involved in these processes. To assess the in vivo requirement of PIEZO1 in iron homeostasis, we analyzed macrophage-specific loss-of function (LOF) Piezo1 mice. First, we showed that the majority of mechanically activated currents in macrophages depended on PIEZO1 ( Figures S6 A–S6D), suggesting that PIEZO1 is the primary mechanosensor in these cells. Next, we assessed the physiological response to short-term iron stress in these mice. We intraperitoneally injected iron dextran into adult mice at 80 μg/g body weight per day for 5 consecutive days to ensure systemic elevation of iron levels in wild-type controls (compare to Figure 4 ). Indeed, this short-term treatment effectively elevated serum iron level, transferrin saturation, and ferritin concentration in wild-type mice compared to the dextran-only vehicle control ( Figures 6 A–6C). In contrast, macrophage-specific LOF Piezo1 mice had normal serum iron measurements and were indistinguishable from vehicle control ( Figures 6 A–6C). This indicates that PIEZO1 is required in macrophages for physiological responses to short-term iron stress. We next examined hepcidin expression in macrophage-specific LOF Piezo1 mice. As expected, hepcidin gene expression in the liver and serum protein levels were more robustly elevated in adult macrophage-specific LOF Piezo1 mice after iron stress compared to wild-type mice ( Figures S6 E and S6F). Taken together with our results from GOF Piezo1 mice, LOF Piezo1 data suggest that this mechanically activated channel regulates iron homeostasis by controlling hepcidin levels through a macrophage-dependent mechanism.
Examination of GOF Piezo1 mice suggests the involvement of this channel in RBC recycling and phagocytosis by macrophages. To test whether PIEZO1 is required for these processes, we performed in vivo RBC turnover experiments on macrophage-specific LOF Piezo1 mice ( Figure S4 A). We found that labeled RBCs in macrophage-specific LOF Piezo1 mice declined significantly slower than in wild-type mice ( Figure 6 D), the opposite effect observed in GOF Piezo1 mice. Indeed, RBC half-life was significantly longer in macrophage-specific LOF Piezo1 mice than in wild-type mice ( Figure S6 G). Finally, we tested the requirement of PIEZO1 for macrophage phagocytosis in cultured BMDMs. Interestingly, we observed a significant reduction in internalized zymosan fluorescence in LOF Piezo1 macrophages compared to wild-type macrophages ( Figures 6 E and 6F), indicating that PIEZO1 is required for efficient phagocytosis. In addition, we detected a reduction in intracellular RBC antigen in LOF Piezo1 macrophages in the hemophagocytosis assay ( Figure 6 G), suggesting that PIEZO1 is required for efficient phagocytosis for RBCs. Importantly, we found that active Rac1 level in LOF Piezo1 macrophages was significantly reduced during hemophagocytosis ( Figure 6 H), indicating that PIEZO1 regulates hemophagocytosis via Rac1 activation. These LOF data demonstrate that PIEZO1 is an essential regulator of macrophage phagocytosis and RBC recycling in vivo .
LOF Piezo1 mice have no PIEZO1 expression throughout development. To test if acute inhibition of PIEZO1 can affect iron metabolism, we used GsMTX4, a nonspecific inhibitor of PIEZO1 in vitro and in vivo ( Bae et al., 2011 6. Bae, C. ∙ Sachs, F. ∙ Gottlieb, P.A. The mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is inhibited by the peptide GsMTx4 Biochemistry. 2011; 50 :6295-6300 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bowman et al., 2007 8. Bowman, C.L. ∙ Gottlieb, P.A. ∙ Suchyna, T.M. ... Mechanosensitive ion channels and the peptide inhibitor GsMTx-4: history, properties, mechanisms and pharmacology Toxicon. 2007; 49 :249-270 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Romac et al., 2018 59. Romac, J.M.-J. ∙ Shahid, R.A. ∙ Swain, S.M. ... Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel and mediates pressure induced pancreatitis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1715 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, we tested its ability to rescue iron overload in GOF Piezo1 mice. Remarkably, a single intraperitoneal administration of GxMTX4 (at 540 μg/kg body weight) prevented serum iron elevation in response to acute iron stress ( Figure S6 H). These data argue against the possibility that developmental consequences of expressing GOF PIEZO1 are responsible for the defects in iron metabolism that we observe. In addition, it raises the possibility that modulating PIEZO1 levels might be of therapeutic value. A summary of how GOF Piezo1 mice develop iron overload is shown in Figure S6 I.
We recently discovered a mild GOF PIEZO1 allele (E756del) common in individuals of African descent from disparate geographic locations, with a mean allele frequency of 18% from available databases ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, an estimated up to one-third of people of west African descent carry one or two copies of this allele. Because the strong but rare GOF PIEZO1 mutations (∼120 patients known worldwide) cause high serum iron levels and lead to iron overload in HX patients of European ancestry, we asked if E756del is associated with higher serum iron levels in African American carriers from the general population. To evaluate the association, we assessed serum samples from 333 self-identifying African American individuals from two commercial blood collection centers. Individuals in this cohort are between 18 and 76 years old, and the majority (85.3%) are males. They all tested negative for infectious diseases and self-reported to be healthy before blood collection. The frequency of E756del allele in this cohort was as expected ( Nguetse et al., 2020 49. Nguetse, C.N. ∙ Purington, N. ∙ Ebel, E.R. ... A common polymorphism in the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 is associated with protection from severe malaria in humans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :9074-9081 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rooks et al., 2019 60. Rooks, H. ∙ Brewin, J. ∙ Gardner, K. ... A gain of function variant in PIEZO1 (E756del) and sickle cell disease Haematologica. 2019; 104 :e91-e93 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ilboudo et al., 2018 34. Ilboudo, Y. ∙ Bartolucci, P. ∙ Garrett, M.E. ... A common functional PIEZO1 deletion allele associates with red blood cell density in sickle cell disease patients Am. J. Hematol. 2018; 93 :E362-E365 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ); 224 individuals were noncarriers (67.3%), 101 were heterozygous carriers (30.3%), and 8 were homozygous carriers (2.4%).
E756del heterozygous carriers under 40 years old did not have significantly different transferrin saturation and ferritin concentration levels compared to noncarriers within the same age group ( Figure 7 A). Remarkably, E756del heterozygous individuals over 40 years old had a statistically significant increase in transferrin saturation and ferritin concentrations compared to noncarriers within the same age group ( Figure 7 A). We observed a clear positive correlation between age and transferrin saturation/ferritin concentration in heterozygous E756del carriers, but not in noncarriers ( Figure 7 B). Statistical analysis was not feasible with the homozygous E756del carriers in our cohort, as sample sizes were too small; however, all homozygotes had relatively elevated serum iron parameters and showed age dependence as well ( Figure 7 B). These data suggest that E756del is associated with higher transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration in an age-dependent manner and parallel previous work in the rare HX patients ( Picard et al., 2019 56. Picard, V. ∙ Guitton, C. ∙ Thuret, I. ... Clinical and biological features in PIEZO1 -hereditary xerocytosis and Gardos channelopathy: a retrospective series of 126 patients Haematologica. 2019; 104 :1554-1564 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In our transgenic mouse models, we showed that hepcidin downregulation is a mechanistic link between GOF PIEZO1 and iron overload. In the human cohorts, we found that serum hepcidin protein concentrations were significantly reduced in E756del carriers over 40 years old compared to the noncarriers within the same age group ( Figure S7 A). Importantly, hepcidin levels were mildly but significantly reduced in E756del carriers under 40 years old compared to noncarriers ( Figure S7 A). Also, we observed an age-dependent hepcidin decline in E756del carriers ( Figure S7 B). This dovetails nicely with our animal model data and suggests that mild hepcidin downregulation precedes the development of abnormally high transferrin saturation and ferritin concentration in individuals with E756del. Importantly, it shows correlation between GOF PIEZO1 data from humans and mice. Together, serum iron analysis and hepcidin measurements suggest that the biological effects of GOF PIEZO1 on serum iron status apply not only to rare instances in individuals of European ancestry (HX patients) but also to African American individuals who self-report to be healthy.
A critical function of blood iron tests is to identify high-risk individuals who are candidates for further MRI examination. Transferrin saturation >50% in men and >45% in women is considered elevated, while ferritin levels >300ug/L in men and >200ug/L in women is considered elevated. ( Adams et al., 2005 1. Adams, P.C. ∙ Reboussin, D.M. ∙ Barton, J.C. ..., Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study Research Investigators Hemochromatosis and iron-overload screening in a racially diverse population N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352 :1769-1778 Crossref Scopus (621) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individuals with these high levels are provisionally diagnosed to have iron overload and recommended for MRI. Previous surveys have shown that ∼5% of African American individuals have high transferrin saturation and ∼10% have high serum ferritin concentration ( Adams et al., 2005 1. Adams, P.C. ∙ Reboussin, D.M. ∙ Barton, J.C. ..., Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study Research Investigators Hemochromatosis and iron-overload screening in a racially diverse population N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352 :1769-1778 Crossref Scopus (621) PubMed Google Scholar ). We applied these criteria to our cohort and found that 6% of individuals (20/333) had high transferrin saturation and 18% (60/333) had high serum ferritin concentration. We plotted the frequency distribution as well as the percentage of E756del allele against transferrin saturation and ferritin concentrations to evaluate whether E756del allele is linked to clinically high serum iron measurements ( Figures S7 C, S7D, and 7 C). Strikingly, although only one in three people in this cohort carry E756del, the majority of individuals with high transferrin saturation or ferritin concentrations carried at least one copy of E756del GOF PIEZO1 ( Figure 7 C, right of dashed line). Indeed, 80% (16/20) of individuals with high transferrin saturation and 82% (49/60) with high serum ferritin were E756del carriers ( Figure 7 D). Remarkably, all individuals (10/10) with high values in both measurements were E756del carriers ( Figure 7 D, right panel).

Section: Discussion

The unexplained iron overload in rare HX patients with GOF PIEZO1 mutations ( Picard et al., 2019 56. Picard, V. ∙ Guitton, C. ∙ Thuret, I. ... Clinical and biological features in PIEZO1 -hereditary xerocytosis and Gardos channelopathy: a retrospective series of 126 patients Haematologica. 2019; 104 :1554-1564 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ) presented an opportunity to explore the role of mechanotransduction in iron metabolism. Our mouse genetics studies revealed an unexpected role of PIEZO1-dependent mechanotransduction in regulating erythropoiesis, macrophage phagocytosis, and iron metabolism. We also highlight the relevance of our findings in a population of African Americans. We show that a common but relatively mild GOF human PIEZO1 allele present in people of African descent is strongly associated with elevated plasma iron levels. Our work suggests that PIEZO1, a mechanically activated ion channel, is an important genetic factor involved in iron metabolism in individuals of non-European ancestry.
HX patients with GOF PIEZO1 mutations develop age-onset iron overload in addition to RBC dehydration. Remarkably, GOF PIEZO1 expression in mouse macrophages, but not RBCs, was sufficient to induce iron overload. Results from both LOF and GOF Piezo1 mice suggest that mechanotransduction is a key regulator of macrophage phagocytosis. For example, expression of GOF PIEZO1 in myeloid cells, including macrophages, induces increased turnover of RBCs. Our hypothesis is that long-term enhancement of macrophage phagocytosis impairs hepcidin production via increased erythropoiesis and erythroferrone hormone secretion and eventually causes iron overload. Although our data are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic decrease in hepcidin pathway by GOF PIEZO1 during adulthood causes late-onset iron overload, we cannot rule out the possibility that aging processes could exacerbate disruption in iron metabolism in mice and humans. Our LOF and GOF mice studies indicate that macrophages are a key agent of PIEZO1 function in iron metabolism, but additional cell types, such as RBCs and hepatocytes ( Andolfo et al., 2020 3. Andolfo, I. ∙ Rosato, B.E. ∙ Manna, F. ... Gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO1 directly impair hepatic iron metabolism via the inhibition of the BMP/SMADs pathway Am. J. Hematol. 2020; 95 :188-197 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as other myeloid cells, can also be involved.
Phagocytosis by macrophages or other phagocytosing immune cells is fundamental for innate immunity and homeostasis. Previous work has focused on characterizing receptor-mediated chemical pathways in phagocytosis, but the role of mechanosensation in phagocytosis is unclear. It is easy to imagine how the act of contacting, enveloping, and internalizing pathogens or cells would depend on sensing physical forces ( Jain et al., 2019 35. Jain, N. ∙ Moeller, J. ∙ Vogel, V. Mechanobiology of macrophages: how physical factors coregulate macrophage plasticity and phagocytosis Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2019; 21 :267-297 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, increased membrane tension has been shown to promote protrusion during phagocytosis ( Masters et al., 2013 44. Masters, T.A. ∙ Pontes, B. ∙ Viasnoff, V. ... Plasma membrane tension orchestrates membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal remodeling, and biochemical signaling during phagocytosis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11875-11880 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ), but how this mechanical force is converted to biological signals is still unclear. Here, we show that PIEZO1, as a sensor for membrane tension, regulates downstream calcium signals and Rac1 activation during phagocytosis. PIEZO1 can be activated by macrophage/RBC interaction during phagocytosis. Alternatively, forces generated by macrophage movement or cell-shape change can also be relevant. A mechanistic understanding of the role of PIEZO1 in macrophages will bring a new perspective to basic understanding of phagocytosis, as well as immune disorders with dysregulated phagocytosis. For example, our finding that macrophages with overactive PIEZO1 cause a higher RBC turnover rate is reminiscent of hemophagocytosis, a common feature observed in systemic sepsis and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; Crayne et al., 2019 15. Crayne, C.B. ∙ Albeituni, S. ∙ Nichols, K.E. ... The immunology of macrophage activation syndrome Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :119 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, elevation in serum ferritin level is a reliable clinical hallmark of severe inflammation diseases like MAS.
The potential impact of our work on macrophage biology might go beyond phagocytosis and iron overload. Macrophages are a heterogeneous cell type that play varied roles in nearly all tissues. Several studies have examined the role of macrophages in tissues that experience a great deal of mechanical force. For example, PIEZO1-dependent mechanosensation is important for innate immune functions ( Solis et al., 2019 63. Solis, A.G. ∙ Bielecki, P. ∙ Steach, H.R. ... Mechanosensation of cyclical force by PIEZO1 is essential for innate immunity Nature. 2019; 573 :69-74 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ; Aykut et al., 2020 5. Aykut, B. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Kim, J.I. ... Targeting Piezo1 unleashes innate immunity against cancer and infectious disease Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 :eabb5168 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, cardiac macrophages facilitate electrical conduction in heart ( Hulsmans et al., 2017 33. Hulsmans, M. ∙ Clauss, S. ∙ Xiao, L. ... Macrophages facilitate electrical conduction in the heart Cell. 2017; 169 :510-522.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ), synovial macrophages provide protective barriers for joints ( Culemann et al., 2019 16. Culemann, S. ∙ Grüneboom, A. ∙ Nicolás-Ávila, J.Á. ... Locally renewing resident synovial macrophages provide a protective barrier for the joint Nature. 2019; 572 :670-675 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ), and tumor-associated macrophages affect cancer survival ( Steidl et al., 2010 64. Steidl, C. ∙ Lee, T. ∙ Shah, S.P. ... Tumor-associated macrophages and survival in classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362 :875-885 Crossref Scopus (1082) PubMed Google Scholar ). As different tissues experience distinct physical stimuli, mechanotransduction may be an important cue in shaping the physiological niche of macrophage subtypes, as is already shown for growth factors, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and other chemical cues.
The genetic roots of iron overload are incompletely understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have recently identified genes in addition to HFE that may be involved in iron overload ( Benyamin et al., 2014 7. Benyamin, B. ∙ Esko, T. ∙ Ried, J.S. ..., InterAct Consortium Novel loci affecting iron homeostasis and their effects in individuals at risk for hemochromatosis Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4926 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based GWAS approaches often miss non-SNP variants compared to whole-genome or exome studies ( Tam et al., 2019 68. Tam, V. ∙ Patel, N. ∙ Turcotte, M. ... Benefits and limitations of genome-wide association studies Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 20 :467-484 Crossref Scopus (1085) PubMed Google Scholar ), and these new approaches have not yet been thoroughly utilized for iron disorders. Importantly, genetic factors for iron overload in populations of non-European ancestry still remain unknown.
Here, we uncovered that E756del GOF PIEZO1 is a genetic locus associated with elevated serum iron levels in African Americans. For example, we show that 80% of high transferrin saturation and 82% of high ferritin in our cohort of African American individuals can be attributed to the presence of E756del. Furthermore, among the over-40-year-old age group in this cohort, individuals with E756del are 11.9 times more likely to have abnormally high ferritin levels compared to noncarriers (odds ratio, 12.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3–26.4). We note that E756del carriers appear to have milder serum iron abnormalities when compared to HX patients; 7 out of 126 rare HX patients have serum ferritin concentration over 1,000 μg/L, whereas only 1 out of 109 E756del carriers in our cohort have a similarly high value. This result is expected, since the very common E756del is a milder GOF allele compared to GOF PIEZO1 mutations in HX patients ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; Albuisson et al., 2013 2. Albuisson, J. ∙ Murthy, S.E. ∙ Bandell, M. ... Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis linked to gain-of-function mutations in mechanically activated PIEZO1 ion channels Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :1884 Crossref Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, we found that ∼3% of African American individuals in our cohort have both high transferrin saturation and high serum ferritin, and all of these individuals are E756del carriers. Furthermore, although our cohort includes only eight homozygous E756del carriers, we observed that E756del homozygosity may have a greater association with high serum iron levels (e.g., six out of eight have high ferritin levels). Since serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are indicators for iron store, our human data clearly show that E756del alters iron status. It is important to note that serum iron measurements are only provisional criteria for iron overload; examination of nonspecific symptoms and MRI are necessary to clinically evaluate the disease penetrance of iron overload. Indeed, we expect that larger clinical studies would be important to evaluate the impact of carrying the common E756del allele for the diagnosis and perhaps treatment of iron overload in individuals of African descent.
A recent study found that heterozygous E756del is associated with resistance to severe malaria in Gabonese children ( Nguetse et al., 2020 49. Nguetse, C.N. ∙ Purington, N. ∙ Ebel, E.R. ... A common polymorphism in the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 is associated with protection from severe malaria in humans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :9074-9081 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing epidemiological support for our previous finding on the E756del allele and its role in protection from Plasmodium infection in mice ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is possible that E756del is positively selected for its role in protection against malaria ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nguetse et al., 2020 49. Nguetse, C.N. ∙ Purington, N. ∙ Ebel, E.R. ... A common polymorphism in the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 is associated with protection from severe malaria in humans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :9074-9081 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that the high serum iron measurements in our cohort is a potentially deleterious consequence of carrying this allele. Interestingly, GOF PIEZO1 in macrophages did not affect malaria infection in mice ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). It seems that enhanced hemophagocytic activity is not sufficient to eliminate Plasmodium -infected RBCs in GOF Piezo1 mice. Plasmodium parasites infect reticulocytes in addition to mature RBCs. Thus, it is also possible that increased reticulocytes in GOF Piezo1 mice, due to increased erythropoiesis, provide extra host cells for the parasites. It is, however, unlikely that altered iron levels contribute to malaria resistance in children, since increased serum iron is late onset. One limitation of our study is that we are unable to evaluate other health conditions associated with high serum iron levels in PIEZO1 E756del carriers. As E756del is not currently genotyped in GWASs and is very difficult to impute ( Buniello et al., 2019 10. Buniello, A. ∙ MacArthur, J.A.L. ∙ Cerezo, M. ... The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog of published genome-wide association studies, targeted arrays and summary statistics 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D1005-D1012 Crossref Scopus (2455) PubMed Google Scholar ), large databases that associate health-related phenotypes with genome- or exome-wide sequence and include individuals of African descent are required to address this important question ( Gurdasani et al., 2015 30. Gurdasani, D. ∙ Carstensen, T. ∙ Tekola-Ayele, F. ... The African Genome Variation Project shapes medical genetics in Africa Nature. 2015; 517 :327-332 Crossref Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2018 42.

Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our strategy of selecting phenotypes in rare HX patients and elucidating mechanisms in transgenic mouse models has revealed an unexpected physiological relevance of mechanotransduction that goes beyond well-characterized mechanotransduction processes in physiology. Importantly, study of individuals carrying the E756del GOF PIEZO1 common allele translates our mechanistic understanding of mechanobiology into clinically relevant insights applicable to medically underappreciated populations. Therefore, our research provides a roadmap to use rich genomic information on PIEZO1 to explore how mechanotransduction contributes to human physiology and disease in unexpected ways.

Gain-of-function (GOF) Piezo1 mice will be made available on request, but we may require a payment and/or a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.
This study did not generate any unique datasets or code.
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). All animals were housed in the same vivarium conditions at a constant temperature of 20°C, with a 12 hour light/dark cycle.
Constitutive, RBC-specific, and macrophage specific GOF Piezo1 mice were generated by breeding mice with conditional GOF Piezo1 allele with Cmv-cre (The Jackson Laboratory stock# 006054), EpoR-cre (a gift from Dr. Klingmuller group at Max-Planck-Institute für Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany), and LysM-cre (The Jackson Laboratory stock# 004781). All GOF Piezo1 mice were generated at Taconic, Hudson, NY, and maintained on C57BL/6 background ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Heterozygous GOF mice were used for the experiments, unless mentioned otherwise. Macrophage-specific LOF Piezo1 mice were generated by breeding mice with conditional LOF Piezo1 allele (The Jackson Laboratory stock# 029213) with the same LysM-cre. All cre driver mice were on C57BL/6 background or were backcrossed at least 10 generations to C57BL/6. Littermates with a mix of equal number of male and female mice were used for experiments. Aging mice (12months to 18months old) born from same breeders were used in the experiments.
Our experiments with human blood samples were approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the office for the Protection of Research Subjects of Scrips Research (IRB-16-6877). Informed consent was waived for excess samples. Samples were collected from Biological Specialty Corporation (Colmar, PA) and Lampire Biological Laboratories (Pipersville, PA), approved by institutional regulations. Blood donors in this cohort are between 18 – 76 years old and the majority (85.3%) are males. Sex and age information are reported in Results . They all tested negative for infectious diseases and self-reported to be healthy before blood collection.
Histological analysis for tissue iron accumulation was performed by Iron Stain Kit (Prussian Blue stain) from Abcam (ab150674, Cambridge, UK) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 10 μm paraffin-embedded liver sections were prepared and deparaffinized as well as dehydrated. Then sections were incubated 3 min in iron stain solution (a mixture of potassium ferrocyanide and hydrochloric acid), followed by water rinsing and counterstaining with nuclear fast and H&E. The iron in the tissues reacted with acid ferrocyanide, resulting in a blue color. Light microcopy was used to capture images (Keyence, Japan).
Total iron was measured by Iron Assay Kit (MAK025, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, whole blood was collected from mouse by cardiac puncture and serum was prepared by centrifugation. Serum was stored at −80C before experiments. Serum (5 – 10-fold dilution) was added directly to the transparent 96-well plate for chemical reaction. In the well, iron from the serum (5 – 10-fold dilution) was released by the addition of acidic buffer and reduced Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ . Released iron was then reacted with a chromagen that can produce a colorimetric (at 593 nm) product, proportional to the total iron level. Standard curves were prepared using iron solutions provided by the kit. The blank background for the assay is the colorimetric reading for the iron solution and blank was subtracted from all readings. Total iron concentrations were determined from the standard curve. For measuring liver iron contents, mouse livers were homogenized using Liberase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) followed by treatment with Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Cell extracts were added into transparent 96-well plates for iron assay as described above. All colorimetric readings were taken by Cytation 5 multi-mode plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT).
Transferrin saturation for mouse and human serum were measured by Total Iron-Bind Capacity (TIBC) kit (BioVision, K392-100; Milpitas, CA). This assay measures TIBC and serum iron level and the transferrin saturation was calculated as percentage of serum iron level compared to TIBC. For the experiment, serum transferrin was first over-saturated with an excess amount of iron (step 1), then the unbound iron was eliminated by forming a complex with ferrozine. To measure TIBC value, iron dissociated from transferrin by changing pH was reacted with ferrozine again (step 2), and the difference in absorbance at 570 nm between step 1 and 2 reflects the capacity of total iron binding. Serum iron was also measured by a similar method as “Serum iron concentration measurements” as above. In both assays, the standard curve for iron concentration was prepared by the iron solution with known concentration provided by the kit. Genotypes were blinded to the experimenter.
Mouse serum ferritin concentration was measured by Mouse Ferritin ELISA kit (Abcam, ab157713, Cambridge, UK). Briefly, 100 μl standard ferritin solutions and diluted serum samples (5-10 fold) were added into pre-coated wells of microtiter plates. The plates were incubated overnight in cold room (4°C), with gentle shaking. Then the plates were incubated with 100 μl 1x Enzyme-Antibody Conjugate within after extensive washing (4 times), 15 min at room temperature. Finally, stop solution was added to terminate the reaction. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined for each well by Cytation 5 multi-mode plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The experiment was performed by duplicate and averaged values were used for calculation. The mean standard readings were plotted against their concentrations to prepare the 4PL exponential sigmoidal standard curve. Ferritin protein concentrations from serum samples were then extrapolated from this curve.
Mouse blood was collected from cardiac puncture into heparin pre-coated microtubes. 80ul fresh blood was used within one hour after collection. The analysis was performed with ProCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer (IDEXX, Westbrook, ME) by following manufacture instructions.
Mouse serum hepcidin protein concentration was measured by HEPCIDIN ELISA kit (mouse) (Aviva Systems Biology, OKEH01408, San Diego, CA). A protocol similar to “Mouse ferritin measurement” was used with following modification: pre-coated plates were incubated with mouse serum samples at 37°C for 4 hours. After extensive washing, the plates were incubated at 37°C for one hour with gentle shaking. Then, substrate solution was incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Absorbance was read at 450nm by Cytation 5 multi-mode plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The experiment was performed by duplicate and averaged values were used for calculation. The mean standard readings were plotted against their concentrations to prepare the 4PL exponential sigmoidal standard curve. Hepcidin protein concentrations from serum samples were then extrapolated from this curve.
Mouse serum erythroferrone concentration was measured by Mouse Erythroferrone ELISA Kit (Intrinsic LifeSciences, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, erythroferrone standard and 1:10 diluted mouse serum was incubated in the microwell assay plate for one hour at room temperature. Biotin conjugate and HRP conjugate were subsequently incubated in the plate for one hour and 30 minutes, respectively. TMB Substrate was then used to develop the color by incubating with the plate for precisely 15 minutes at room temperature. Absorbance at 450nm was measured after Stop Solution treatment. Sufficient washes were performed between each step. For data analysis, a standard curve was prepared by using Graphpad Prism 4-PL curve fit function. The protein concentration was then interpolated from the OD reading.
For GOF Piezo1 mice, adult animals (2-5 months old) were intraperitoneally injected with iron dextran (Sigma-Aldrich, D8517, St. Louis, MO) at 40 μg/ gram body weight in adult mice ( Zhang et al., 2011 73. Zhang, Z. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ An, P. ... Ferroportin1 deficiency in mouse macrophages impairs iron homeostasis and inflammatory responses Blood. 2011; 118 :1912-1922 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 18 to 24 hours, whole blood was collected from cardiac puncture to prepare serum for enzymatic assays (described above). For LOF Piezo1 mice, adult animals (2-5 months old) were intraperitoneally injected with iron dextran at 80 μg/ gram body weight in adult mice for a consecutive 5-day period. In both experiments, dextran solution was used as a vehicle control. For GsMTX4 rescue experiment, iron challenge treatment was performed 1 hour after a single dose of GsMTX4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 540ug per kg body weight was intraperitoneally injected into mice.
Whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture from C57BL/6 donor mice. RBCs were washed in sterile saline three times after centrifugation at 1000xg for 3min and then labeled with fluorescence by incubating with 5(6)-CFSE dyes (Molecular Probes C1157, Eugen, OR) at 37°C for 15-30 min. Then labeled RBCs were washed in sterile saline three times again at 1000xg for 3 min and diluted to 5x10 5 RBCs/ml as working solution. 200 μl working solution was intravenously injected into the tail veins of experimental mice for analysis. Every three days, 1.5-2 μl tail blood was collected from injected mice in 180 μl Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Solution with 2% fetal bovine serum on 96-well plates. The cytometry was performed with NovoCyte Flow Cytometry system (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego CA) following manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, erythrocytes were selected by gating on forward/side-light scatter. Fluorescence was measured by excitation of RBCs with a laser at a wavelength of 488 nm and emission of the green fluorescence for CFSE probe. We analyzed RBC fluorescence intensity in experiments comparing wild-type and GOF mice immediately after collecting tail blood each day ( Figure 5 ). However, we had limited access to the cytometry facility during the partial shutdown of Scripps Research during COVID19 pandemic. Therefore, when performing similar RBC fluorescence assay on wild-type and LOF littermates, we fixed and saved the tail blood samples at various time points at 4°C for up to 7 days before analysis. This could explain the small difference in half-life values of wild-type mice in GOF and LOF experiments ( Figures 5 C and S4 C).
Adult mice between 2-6 months old were sacrificed by CO 2 inhalation. Spleens were dissected from abdomen and cells were filtered through 70 μm nylon strainer (Corning Falcon, Tewksbury, MA). Erythrocytes were lysed by 1xRBC lysis buffer (Biolegend, San Diego, CA). A single splenic cell suspension was then obtained. Antibodies for FACS sorting were used to stain splenic cells: AF647-conjugated F4/80 (pan-macrophages), Alexa 488-conjugated CD68 (M1 macrophages), PE-Dazzle 594-conjugated CD86 (M1 macrophages), PE-conjugated CD163 (M2 macrophages), BV711-conjugated MHC-II (MHC-II macrophages), eFluor450-conjugated CD3, CD19, NK1.1 (for excluding T-, B- and NK- cells) and BV421-conjugated TER119 (erythrocyte). Antibodies were purchased from Biolegend and used at recommended concentration by manufacture. Briefly, surface protein markers were stained on ice followed by fixation/permeabilization at room temperature. Then, antibody for intracellular antigen (TER-119) was used to stain the cells at room temperature. FACS sorting was performed on Yeti model ZE5 Bio-Rad (Irvine, CA) at Flow core facility of Scripps Research. Briefly, dead cells (NIR Zombie stain, Biolegend) as well as T-, B- and NK-cells were excluded. F4/80 positive cells were further analyzed for M1 and M2 macrophages. To evaluate hemophagocytosis, F4/80 and Ter-119 double positive cells were counted. Unstained cells were used as a negative to for cytometry. Data were analyzed by FlowJO (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). For gene expression experiment of splenic macrophages, F4/80 positive cells were collected directly in TRIzol solution for RNA preparation (see below).
Macrophages were cultured from bone marrow blood progenitor cells following a well-established protocol ( Weischenfeldt and Porse, 2008 69. Weischenfeldt, J. ∙ Porse, B. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (bmm): isolation and applications CSH Protoc. 2008; 2008 pdb.prot5080 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, bone marrow cells were isolated from adult mouse femur with lymphocyte medium (RPMI-1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum) and cultured with the presence of 10 ng/ml mouse colony stimulating factor (mCSF) for 6-8 days at 37°C before experiments. For general in vitro phagocytosis assay using zymosan particles, macrophages were starved with lymphocyte medium (without mCSF) for 2 hours. Then, 5 μL of fluorescent zymosan particles were incubated with the starved macrophages for 2 hours at 37°C. To quantify the phagocytosis, cells were washed by PBS three times with DAPI staining in the last wash for 20 min at room temperature. Then cells were fixed and imaged using mCherry and DAPI channels on fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Japan). The fluorescence intensities from macrophages were normalized to DAPI positive cells to represent phagocytosis activity. For hemophagocytosis assay, starved wild-type, GOF and LOF Piezo1 macrophages (prepared as same procedure above) were incubated with opsonized RBCs with reagents from CytoSelect 96-Well Phagocytosis Assay (RBC substrate, Cell Biolabs, CBA-220). Cells at different time courses during phagocytosis were collected and lysed for quantifying RBC content by measuring the absorbance at 610nm (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA).
Experiments performed by a previously published procedure ( Ma et al., 2018 42. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 allele in African populations causes RBC dehydration and attenuates plasmodium infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were cultured from wild-type, GOF and LOF Piezo1 mice as described above. To measure calcium signals, BMDMs were seeded into 384-well reader plate, at 20,000 cells per well. The plate was incubated overnight then washed with assay buffer (1xHBSS, 10mM HEPES, pH7.4). During imaging, Yoda1 (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added into the reader plate in a serially diluted manner. Intracellular calcium was measured by Fluo-8 AM dye (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) pre-loaded into BMDMs. Time zero was the time point of initial Yoda1 addition and the calcium signal at time zero was defined as zero. All data points were normalized to time zero.
To validate this assay, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were treated with 10ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 15minutes. Then, MEFs were lysed and active Rac1 levels were measured by Rac1G-LISA Activation Assay Kit (enzyme-linked immunosorbent based assay) (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) following manufacturer’s instruction. As a control, MEFs were incubated with 10ng/ml EGF and 100uM NSC23766, a specific Rac1 inhibitor (Tocris, Minneapolis, MN). Wild-type, GOF and LOF Piezo1 BMDMs during phagocytosis (see above section on macrophage phagocytosis assay) were lysed at different time points for detecting active Rac1 protein. Time zero (before phagocytosis) is the baseline signal and defined as zero. All data were normalized to time zero. Similarly, antibody specific for active Rac1 (1:200 dilution, NewEast Biosciences, King of Prussia, PA) was validated in MEFs by EGF and Rac1 inhibitor treatment. Wild-type and GOF Piezo1 BMDMs were fixed by 4% PFA after 30min phagocytosis followed by antibody staining. Fluorescent images were captured by a Nikon Instruments A1R+ confocal microscope.
BMDMs from wild-type and LOF Piezo1 adult mice (2-6 months) were cultured on glass coverslips for 7 days. RNAscope procedures were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (ACDBio: #323100) using probes against Piezo1 (ACDBio: #400181) and Piezo2 (ACDBio: #439971-C2).
Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers or FACS sorted splenic macrophages by TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). At least 100 ng total RNA was used to generate 1st strand cDNA using the Quantitect reverse
transcription kit (QIAGEN). Real time PCR assays were set up using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison WI). The reaction was run in the ABI 7900HT fast real time system using 1 μl of the cDNA in a 20 μl reaction according to the manufacturer’s instructions in triplicates. Primers were designed for target gene (m hepcidin ) (forward GGCAAAGAGGCAAAATGTGC, reverse TTGAGCTTGCTCTGGTGTCTGG) and reference gene ( Gapdh ) (forward primer GCACCACCAACTGCTTAG, reverse primer GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC). Il-1 beta (forward CCAGCTTCAAATCTCACAGCAG, reverse CTTCTTTGGGTATTGCTTGGGATC), Il-6 (forward TCCAGTTGCCTTCTTGGGAC, reverse GTACTCCAGAAGACCAGAGG), Il-10 (forward TGGCCCAGAAATCAAGGAGC, reverse CAGCAGACTCAATACACACT), TNFa (forward CACAGAAAGCATGATCCGCGACGT, reverse CGGCAGAGAGGAGGTTGACTTTCT), TGFbeta (forward GACCGCAACAACGCCATCTA, reverse GGCGTATCAGTGGGGGTCAG), Il12b (forward GTCCTCAGAAGCTAACCATCTCC, reverse CCAGAGCCTATGACTCCATGTC), Il-12a (forward CAATCACGCTACCTCCTCTTTT, reverse CAGCAGTGCAGGAATAATGTTTC), Il-23 (forward CAGCAGCTCTCTCGGAATCTC, reverse TGGATACGGGGCACATTATTTTT), ccl2 (forward TTAAAAACCTGGATCGGAACCAA, reverse GCATTAGCTTCAGATTTACGGGT), ccl3 (forward TGTACCATGACACTCTGCAAC, reverse CAACGATGAATTGGCGTGGAA), ccl4 (forward TTCCTGCTGTTTCTCTTACACCT, reverse CTGTCTGCCTCTTTTGGTCAG), ccl5 (forward GCTGCTTTGCCTACCTCTCC, reverse TCGAGTGACAAACACGACTGC), ccl17 (forward TACCATGAGGTCACTTCAGATGC, reverse GCACTCTCGGCCTACATTGG), cxcl10 (forward CCAAGTGCTGCCGTCATTTTC, reverse GGCTCGCAGGGATGATTTCAA), ccl1 (forward TGCCGTGTGGATACAGGATG, reverse GTTGAGGCGCAGCTTTCTCTA). Calibrations and normalizations were done using the 2-ΔΔCT method, where ΔΔCT = ((CT(target gene) -CT (reference gene)) - (CT (calibrator) - CT (reference gene)).
Serum inflammatory molecules were measured by Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines Multi-Analyte ELISArray Kits (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 10ul serum from wild-type GOF Piezo1 adult mice (2 – 6 months old) was used for the assay. Protein levels were measured by absorbance at 450um.
Bone marrow cells were plated on 12 mm diameter PDL-coated coverslips on day 1 after extraction (100K cells/well in 24-well plate) from WT and macrophage KO littermates (LyzM-cre) and treated with mouse CSF recombinant protein at 10ng/mL (GIBCO, Dublin, Ireland) to induce differentiated BMDMs. On day 5, cells derived from two separate experiments were tested using cell attached patch clamp methods for their responsiveness to membrane stretch using a HSPC ( Coste et al., 2010 14. Coste, B. ∙ Mathur, J. ∙ Schmidt, M. ... Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1967) PubMed Google Scholar ; Murthy et al., 2018 48. Murthy, S.E. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ∙ Whitwam, T. ... OSCA/TMEM63 are an evolutionarily conserved family of mechanically activated ion channels elife. 2018;, e41844 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). LPS (20 or 50 ng/ml, 1-3 days) was used to induce membrane changes mimicking those occurring during phagocytosis. Pipettes with large diameter tips (electrodes had resistances of 1.4 – 2.6 MΩ) were needed to observe channel activity in WT BMDMs. Similar pipettes were used for recordings of WT (2.0 ± 0.3 MΩ, n = 18) and LoF (2.1 ± 0.3 MΩ, n = 14) cells. Cells were maintained in a high KCl bath solution during recordings to depolarize the membrane potential. Cells were tested on days 6, 7 and 8 after plating, a time when most precursors had differentiated into mature BMDMs. The final confluency was ∼50%. Spontaneous single channel currents with amplitudes consistent with mouse Piezo1 (Coste et al., 2015, Figure 2 E) were often observed at a pipette potential of 80mV (during at least 30 s of observation; membrane potential near −80mV depending on resting potential). In WT cells 11 of the 18 cells recorded revealed spontaneousz activity and, of these, 10 responded with stretch activated currents; of those having no mPiezo1-like spontaneous activity (n = 7), 5 were non-responsive to stretch. In the case of the LoF cells, only 2 of 14 cells revealed spontaneous activity similar to that observed in WT cells, one of which revealed SAC ( Figures S6 A–S6D). In one WT case, determination of the SAC reversal potential was possible and it was consistent with being mediated by a non-selective cation channel (−1.4mV).
333 blood samples (less than 1 ml) were used for DNA preparation and genotyping, while serum was used for transferrin saturation, ferritin and hepcidin measurements. 200 μL of blood samples were used for genomic DNA isolation by QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). A ∼200 bp PCR amplicon that contained E756 locus was generated for sequencing E756del or wild-type allele (forward primer: 5′CAGGCAGGATGCAGTGAGTG3′, reverse primer: 5′GGACATGGCACAGCAGACTG3′. Reverse primer was used for sequencing).
Human serum hepcidin concentration was measured by Human Hepcidin Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, DHP250, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, 50 μl standard hepcidin solutions and diluted serum samples (10-fold) were added into pre-coated wells of microtiter plates. The plates were incubated with 200 μl human hepcidin conjugate overnight in cold room (4°C), with gentle shaking. Then the plates were incubated with 200 μl substrate solution after extensive washing (4 times) at room temperature about 2 hours, followed by the addition of stop solution. The absorbance at 540um was determined for each well by Cytation 5 multi-mode plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The experiment was performed by duplicate and averaged values were used for calculation. The mean standard readings against their concentrations were used to prepare the best smooth curve. Hepcidin protein concentrations from serum samples were then extrapolated from this curve. Genotypes were blinded to the experimenter.
Human serum ferritin concentration was measured by Human Ferritin ELISA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, RAB0197, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, 100 μL standard ferritin solutions and diluted serum samples (10-fold) were added into pre-coated wells of microtiter plates. The plates were then incubated overnight in cold room (4°C), with gentle shaking. Then the plates were incubated with 100 μL detection antibody for 1 hour after extensive washing (4 times) at room temperature. Next, 100 μL HRP-Streptavidin solution was added and incubated 45 min at room temperature. Finally, 100 μL ELISA Colorimetric was added and incubated for 30min at room temperature. The absorbance at 450um was determined for each well by Cytation 5 multi-mode plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The experiment was performed by duplicate and averaged values were used for calculation. The mean standard readings against their concentrations were used to prepare the best smooth curve. Ferritin protein concentrations from serum samples were then extrapolated from this curve. Genotypes were blinded to the experimenter.
One-way ANOVA analysis was performed for Figures 1 and 2 . Student t tests (two-tail) were performed for Figures 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 . Multiple t tests by Bonferroni correction were performed for Figures 4 and 6 . Prism 8 software was used for all statistical analyses, standard curve preparation and data visualization. Statistical details about n number and p value are reported in Figure legends.
