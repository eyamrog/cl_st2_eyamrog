Title: Severe COVID-19 Is Marked by a Dysregulated Myeloid Cell Compartment


Abstract: Summary

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a mild to moderate respiratory tract infection, however, a subset of patients progress to severe disease and respiratory failure. The mechanism of protective immunity in mild forms and the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 associated with increased neutrophil counts and dysregulated immune responses remain unclear. In a dual-center, two-cohort study, we combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell proteomics of whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to determine changes in immune cell composition and activation in mild versus severe COVID-19 (242 samples from 109 individuals) over time. HLA-DR hi CD11c hi inflammatory monocytes with an interferon-stimulated gene signature were elevated in mild COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was marked by occurrence of neutrophil precursors, as evidence of emergency myelopoiesis, dysfunctional mature neutrophils, and HLA-DR lo monocytes. Our study provides detailed insights into the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals profound alterations in the myeloid cell compartment associated with severe COVID-19.

Section: Introduction

Clinical presentations of COVID-19 are highly variable, and while the majority of patients experiences mild to moderate symptoms, 10%–20% of patients develop pneumonia and severe disease ( Huang et al., 2020a 43.

Clinical deterioration with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) typically develops in the second week of disease. This kinetic may suggest a role for secondary immune responses in the development of severe COVID-19 ( Ong et al., 2020 90. Ong, E.Z. ∙ Chan, Y.F.Z. ∙ Leong, W.Y. ...

However, the exact mechanisms that govern the pathophysiology of the different disease courses of COVID-19 remain ill-defined.
Single-cell studies of bronchoalveolar lavage samples have suggested a complex dysregulation of the pulmonary immune response in severe COVID-19 ( Chua et al., 2020 20.

Overall, systemic inflammation is linked to an unfavorable clinical course of disease and the development of severe COVID-19 ( Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020 33.

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces specific T cell and B cell responses, which is reflected by elevation of SARS-CoV-2 peptide-specific T cells ( Braun et al., 2020 12.

A number of studies and regular clinical observations indicate an increase of neutrophils and a decrease of non-classical (CD14 lo CD16 hi ) monocytes in severe COVID-19 ( Hadjadj et al., 2020 36.

Profound immune dysregulation is commonly observed in severe infections and sepsis, characterized by a progression from hyperinflammatory states to immunosuppression ( Remy et al., 2020 98.

Giamarellos-Bourboulis, E.J. ∙ Netea, M.G. ∙ Rovina, N. ... Complex Immune Dysregulation in COVID-19 Patients with Severe Respiratory Failure Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :992-1000 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (470) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, comprehensive insights into the immunopathology of severe COVID-19 are still missing. Exacerbated immune responses played a major role in the pathophysiology of SARS, leading to severe lung injury and respiratory failure ( Perlman and Dandekar, 2005 92. Perlman, S. ∙ Dandekar, A.A. Immunopathogenesis of coronavirus infections: implications for SARS Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5 :917-927 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mitigation of immunodysregulation is therefore viewed as a major therapeutic avenue for the treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19 ( Dimopoulos et al., 2020 29.

Rev. 2020; 19 :102567 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). In support of this view, a recent multicenter study reported that dexamethasone treatment significantly reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in patients on mechanical ventilation ( Horby et al., 2020 41. Horby, P. ∙ Lim, W.S. ∙ Emberson, J.R. ... Dexamethasone in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 - Preliminary Report N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; Published online July 17, 2020 Crossref Scopus (1143) Google Scholar ). Previous studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomes in a small number of patients with COVID-19 revealed changes in several cellular compartments, including monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and T cells ( Lee et al., 2020 59.

The heterogeneity of clinical manifestations and the complexity of immune responses to COVID-19 highlight the need for detailed analyses using high-resolution techniques and well-characterized clinical cohorts. We hypothesized that distinct responses, particularly within the innate immune system, underlie the different clinical trajectories of COVID-19 patients ( Chua et al., 2020 20. Chua, R.L. ∙ Lukassen, S. ∙ Trump, S. ... COVID-19 severity correlates with airway epithelium-immune cell interactions identified by single-cell analysis Nat.

Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :863-869 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics to analyze immune responses in blood samples in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients.
Activated HLA-DR hi CD11c hi CD14 + monocytes were increased in patients with mild COVID-19, similar to patients with SARS-CoV-2 negative flu-like illness (“FLI”). In contrast, monocytes characterized by low expression of HLA-DR , and marker genes indicative of anti-inflammatory functions (e.g., CD163 and PLAC8 ) appeared in patients with severe COVID-19. The granulocyte compartment was profoundly altered in severe COVID-19, marked by the appearance of neutrophil precursors due to emergency myelopoiesis, dysfunctional neutrophils expressing PD-L1, and exhibiting an impaired oxidative burst response. Collectively, our study links highly dysregulated myeloid cell responses to severe COVID-19.

Section: Results

In order to probe the divergent immune responses in mild versus severe COVID-19, we analyzed blood samples collected from independent patient cohorts at two university medical centers in Germany. Samples from the Berlin cohort (cohort 1) ( Kurth et al., 2020 55. Kurth, F. ∙ Roennefarth, M. ∙ Thibeault, C. ... Studying the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019: a protocol for the Berlin prospective COVID-19 patient cohort (Pa-COVID-19) Infection. 2020; 48 :619-626 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), were analyzed by mass cytometry (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) using a droplet-based single-cell platform (10x Chromium), while samples from the Bonn cohort (cohort 2) were analyzed by multi-color flow cytometry (MCFC) and on a microwell-based scRNA-seq system (BD Rhapsody). We analyzed a total of 24 million cells by their protein markers and >328,000 cells by scRNA-seq in 242 samples from 53 COVID-19 patients and 56 controls, including 8 patients with FLI ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 A; Table S1 ).
We first characterized alterations of the major leukocyte lineages by mass cytometry on whole blood samples from 20 COVID-19 patients collected between day 4 and day 29 after symptom onset and compared them to 10 age- and gender-matched controls and 8 FLI patients. We designed two antibody panels to specifically capture alterations in mononuclear leukocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes, and DCs, panel 1), and in granulocytes ( Table S2 , panel 2). High-resolution SPADE analysis was performed with 400 target nodes and individual nodes were aggregated into cell subsets based on lineage-specific markers, such as CD14 for monocytes and CD15 for neutrophils ( Figure S1 B). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis revealed distinct clustering of samples from COVID-19 patients, FLI, and healthy controls, with marked changes of the monocyte and granulocyte compartment ( Figure 1 C). Leukocyte lineages were compared in the earliest available samples in COVID-19 patients (days 4–13), FLI, and controls ( Figure 1 D; Table S1 ). Because leukocyte counts were not available for all control samples, we compared the control samples for CyTOF (“ctrl CyTOF”) to data from our recently published healthy control cohorts (“ctrl flow”) ( Kverneland et al., 2016 56. Kverneland, A.H. ∙ Streitz, M. ∙ Geissler, E. ...

The proportions of all major lineages were highly similar, irrespective of the methodology ( Figure 1 D). Cell counts of the published cohort could therefore be used as a reference to report absolute cell counts for leukocyte lineages in COVID-19 samples. In line with recent reports ( Barnes et al., 2020 8. Barnes, B.J. ∙ Adrover, J.M. ∙ Baxter-Stoltzfus, A. ... Targeting potential drivers of COVID-19: Neutrophil extracellular traps J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200652 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xia et al., 2020 130. Xia, X. ∙ Wen, M. ∙ Zhan, S. ... [An increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio is an early warning signal of severe COVID-19] Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2020; 40 :333-336 PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed elevated leukocytes and increased proportions of neutrophils in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 1 D), whereas only proportional increases in neutrophils were evident in FLI and mild COVID-19 patients ( Figure 1 D). Total lymphocytes and T cells were strongly reduced in all COVID-19 and FLI patients, whereas non-classical monocytes were specifically depleted in COVID-19 ( Figure 1 D). Increased neutrophils in severe COVID-19 and loss of non-classical monocytes in both mild and severe disease were validated in cohort 2 by MCFC ( Figure S1 C; Tables S1 and S3 ).
Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lymphopenia and profound alterations of the myeloid compartment.
Given the dramatic changes in various immune cell populations ( Figures 1 C and 1D), we next assessed their composition and activation state by droplet-based scRNA-seq in 27 samples from 18 COVID-19 patients (8 mild and 10 severe, cohort 1, Table S1 ) collected between day 3 and day 20 after symptom onset. A total of 48,266 single-cell transcriptomes of PBMCs were analyzed together with 50,783 PBMCs from publicly available control datasets (21 control donors, Table S1 ). UMAP and high-resolution cell type classification identified all cell types expected in the mononuclear compartment of blood with a high granularity in the monocytes, identifying five distinct clusters (clusters 0–4) ( Figures 2 A and S2 A; Table S4 ). Monocytes in clusters 0–3 expressed CD14 , and cluster 4 comprised the non-classical monocytes marked by FCGR3A (encoding CD16a) and low expression of CD14 . Separate visualization of cells in mild and severe cases revealed highly disease severity-specific clusters ( Figure 2 B). A distinct subset of CD14 + monocytes (cluster 1) ( Figure 2 A) marked by high expression of HLA-DRA , HLA-DRB1 , and co-stimulatory molecule CD83 ( Figure S2 D), the engagement of which has been linked to prolonged expansion of antigen-specific T cells ( Hirano et al., 2006 39. Hirano, N. ∙ Butler, M.O. ∙ Xia, Z. ... Engagement of CD83 ligand induces prolonged expansion of CD8+ T cells and preferential enrichment for antigen specificity Blood. 2006; 107 :1528-1536 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), was selectively detected in mild COVID-19 ( Figure 2 C). In addition, we identified another closely related CD14 + HLA-DR hi monocyte population (cluster 2), which was characterized by high expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, upon closer analysis, this cluster was found to originate from a single donor with mild COVID-19 ( Figures 2 A–2C and S2 D). Both cluster 1 and cluster 2 expressed high levels of ISGs IFI6 and ISG15 ( Figure S2 D). In patients with severe COVID-19, monocytes showed low expression of HLA-DR and high expression of alarmins S100A8/9/12 (cluster 3, Figures 2 A–2C and S2 D). The most prominent change in severe COVID-19 was the appearance of two distinct cell populations (cluster 5+6), absent in PBMCs of patients with mild COVID-19 and control donors ( Figure 2 A). Published markers ( Kwok et al., 2020 57. Kwok, I. ∙ Becht, E. ∙ Xia, Y. ...

Ng, L.G. ∙ Ostuni, R. ∙ Hidalgo, A. Heterogeneity of neutrophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :255-265 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) identified clusters 5 and 6 as neutrophils and immature neutrophils, respectively ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Immature neutrophils (cluster 6) expressed CD24 , PGLYRP1 , DEFA3 , and DEFA4 , whereas neutrophil cluster 5 expressed FCGR3B (CD16b), CXCL8 , and LCN2 (lipocalin 2) ( Figures 2 C and S2 A). Their migration within the PBMC fraction on a density gradient marked these cells as low-density neutrophils (LDNs).
In the second cohort, PBMCs from 17 COVID-19 patients (8 mild, 9 severe, Table S1 ), sampled between 2 and 25 days after symptom onset, and 13 controls, were collected for scRNA-seq on a microwell-based platform (BD Rhapsody). High-quality single-cell transcriptomes for 139,848 PBMCs were assessed and their population structure was visualized using UMAP ( Figure 2 D; Table S4 ). Data-driven cell-type classification ( Aran et al., 2019 5. Aran, D. ∙ Looney, A.P. ∙ Liu, L. ... Reference-based analysis of lung single-cell sequencing reveals a transitional profibrotic macrophage Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :163-172 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cluster-specific marker gene expression identified all cell types expected in the PBMC compartment and revealed additional clusters and substructures ( Figures 2 D and S2 B). Similar to cohort 1, monocytes exhibited significant plasticity and were subclassified into 5 clusters ( Figure 2 D, clusters 0–4). Disease-severity-associated changes seen in cohort 1 were validated in cohort 2 ( Figure 2 E). Immature and mature neutrophil clusters were detected in both cohorts (clusters 5–6) and showed near identical marker gene expression ( Figure 2 C). Similar to cohort 1, a prominent shift in subpopulation occupancy was observed in the monocyte clusters ( Figures 2 D and 2E).
Based on the union of the top 50 genes for monocyte and neutrophil clusters, we found a high correlation between the independently defined functional states within the monocyte compartment, and mature and immature neutrophils in cohort 1 and cohort 2 ( Figure S2 C). Violin plot representation of important marker genes illustrated distinct phenotypic states and underscored the high similarity of the two cohorts ( Figure S2 D).
Disease-severity-dependent alterations of the monocyte compartment and the appearance of two LDN populations were detected in two cohorts of COVID-19 patients.
The monocyte compartment is particularly affected by COVID-19, indicated by a loss of CD14 lo CD16 hi non-classical monocytes ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Disease-severity-dependent shifts in monocyte activation were identified by scRNA-seq ( Figure 2 ). We further explored the phenotypic alterations of the monocyte compartment using mass cytometry ( Table S2 , panel 1) on whole blood samples from COVID-19 patients with a mild or severe disease (n = 8+9), patients with FLI (n = 8), and age- and gender-matched controls (n = 9, all collected within cohort 1, Table S1 ). Unsupervised cluster analysis using 15 surface antigens and the proliferation marker Ki67 separated the monocyte and DC compartment into 12 main cell clusters ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Classical CD14 hi CD16 − monocytes displayed high heterogeneity and separated into seven main subclusters. Most classical monocytes showed high expression of activation markers CD38, CD95, and CXCR3. The four most prevalent clusters (1, 2, 5, and 6) varied according to CD62L, HLA-DR, CD11c, and Ki67 expression, with CD62L and HLA-DR showing a reverse expression pattern ( Figure 3 A). Cluster 1 displayed an activated inflammatory phenotype with high co-expression of CD11c and HLA-DR ( Bernardo et al., 2018 10. Bernardo, D. ∙ Marin, A.C. ∙ Fernández-Tomé, S. ... Human intestinal pro-inflammatory CD11c high CCR2 + CX3CR1 + macrophages, but not their tolerogenic CD11c - CCR2 - CX3CR1 - counterparts, are expanded in inflammatory bowel disease Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11 :1114-1126 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Janols et al., 2014 47.

Dis. 2014; 33 :313-324 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we observed classical monocyte cell clusters (7, 9, and 10) with high CD226 and CD69 but low HLA-DR expression and thus signs of altered or alternative activation ( Davison et al., 2017 26.

Vo, A.V. ∙ Takenaka, E. ∙ Shibuya, A. ... Expression of DNAM-1 (CD226) on inflammatory monocytes Mol. Immunol. 2016; 69 :70-76 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the HLA-DR lo clusters, particularly cluster 7 showed high expression of CD34 indicative of a more immature phenotype. In contrast, the majority of CD14 hi CD16 + intermediate monocyte cell clusters showed high CD11c and HLA-DR expression.
Monocytes from COVID-19 patients separated from those of FLI patients and controls ( Figure 3 B), mainly based on elevated CD226 and CD69 expression in COVID-19. Monocytes in mild and severe COVID-19 clustered separately, and monocytes from mild COVID-19 clustered closer to monocytes in FLI. FLI patients and mild COVID-19 contained higher proportions of HLA-DR hi CD11c hi cells (clusters 3 and 11), and total HLA-DR hi CD11c hi monocytes were higher compared to controls and severe COVID-19, reflecting blunted monocyte activation in severe COVID-19, reminiscent of observations in sepsis ( Janols et al., 2014 47.

Dis. 2014; 33 :313-324 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 A, 3C, and 3D). Increased levels of activated HLA-DR hi CD11c hi monocytes in mild COVID-19 patients were confirmed by MCFC in cohort 2 ( Figure 3 E). In severe COVID-19, we detected increased expression of CD226 and CD69 (cluster 10) and/or decreased expression of HLA-DR, and total CD226 + CD69 + monocytes were elevated compared to controls. Cluster 10 expressed high levels of CD10, which is induced during macrophage differentiation ( Huang et al., 2020b 44. Huang, X. ∙ He, C. ∙ Lin, G. ... Induced CD10 expression during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation identifies a unique subset of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 524 :1064-1071 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, an alternative activation pattern of classical monocytes appeared to be COVID-19-specific and was associated with severe disease. Besides activated lymphocytes, monocytes also upregulate CD69 expression ( Davison et al., 2017 26. Davison, G.M. ∙ Nkambule, B.B. ∙ Mkandla, Z. ... Platelet, monocyte and neutrophil activation and glucose tolerance in South African Mixed Ancestry individuals Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :40329 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ), which promotes tissue infiltration and retention ( Cibrián and Sánchez-Madrid, 2017 22. Cibrián, D. ∙ Sánchez-Madrid, F. CD69: from activation marker to metabolic gatekeeper Eur. J. Immunol. 2017; 47 :946-953 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, CD226 expression on alternatively activated monocytes might also promote diapedesis and tissue infiltration ( Reymond et al., 2004 100. Reymond, N. ∙ Imbert, A.M. ∙ Devilard, E. ... DNAM-1 and PVR regulate monocyte migration through endothelial junctions J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199 :1331-1341 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, this activation pattern may contribute to the reduction of circulating monocytes in COVID-19.
Next, we dissected COVID-19-associated phenotypic alterations of monocytes by scRNA-seq. Marker genes of the monocyte clusters derived from Figure 2 A showed that mild COVID-19 associated clusters 1 and 2 were characterized by an ISG-driven transcriptional program ( Figure S3 A), and gene ontology enrichment analysis (GOEA) assigned these clusters to “type I interferon signaling pathway” ( Figure S3 B). A monocyte cluster marked by low expression of HLA-DR and high expression of S100A12 and CXCL8 (cluster 3, HLA-DR lo S100A hi ) was strongly associated with severe COVID-19 ( Figures 2 B, S2 D, and S3 A). For further in-depth analysis, we subclustered the monocyte compartment of the PBMC dataset of cohort 2 ( Figures 2 D and S3 C; Table S1 ) resulting in 7 subclusters ( Figure 4 A). Cluster 1 was marked by high expression of HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1 and co-stimulatory molecule CD83 and was therefore designated HLA-DR hi CD83 hi -activated inflammatory monocytes ( Figures 4 A, 4B, S3 D, and S3E). We identified two major clusters (0 and 2) and a smaller cluster (6) with low HLA-DR expression, which were associated with severe COVID-19 ( Figures 4 B, S3 D, and S3E). Low HLA-DR expression is an established surrogate marker of monocyte dysfunction ( Venet et al., 2020 123. Venet, F. ∙ Demaret, J. ∙ Gossez, M. ... Myeloid cells in sepsis-acquired immunodeficiency Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2020; Published online March 23, 2020 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) which results in reduced responsiveness to microbial stimuli ( Veglia et al., 2018 122. Veglia, F. ∙ Perego, M. ∙ Gabrilovich, D. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells coming of age Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :108-119 Crossref Scopus (493) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that clusters 0 and 6 are composed of dysfunctional monocytes. Genes of the S100A family were expressed in both HLA-DR lo clusters ( Figure 4 B), albeit to a higher degree in cluster 0 ( HLA-DR lo S100A hi , e.g., S100A12 ) ( Figures S2 D and S3 E; Table S4 ). Cluster 2 monocytes expressed high levels of SELL (CD62L) and CD163 ( HLA-DR lo CD163 hi ) ( Figure 4 B), associated with anti-inflammatory macrophage functions ( Fischer-Riepe et al., 2020 32. Fischer-Riepe, L. ∙ Daber, N. ∙ Schulte-Schrepping, J. ... CD163 expression defines specific, IRF8-dependent, immune-modulatory macrophages in the bone marrow J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2020; Published online March 19, 2020 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ; MacParland et al., 2018 70. MacParland, S.A. ∙ Liu, J.C. ∙ Ma, X.Z. ... Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic macrophage populations Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4383 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as pre-maturation markers like MPO and PLAC8 ( Figure 4 B), recently linked to immature monocyte states in sepsis patients ( Reyes et al., 2020 99. Reyes, M. ∙ Filbin, M.R. ∙ Bhattacharyya, R.P. ... An immune-cell signature of bacterial sepsis Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :333-340 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with these findings, clusters 0, 2, and 6 were significantly enriched in a gene signature derived from sepsis-associated monocytes ( Figure 4 C) ( Reyes et al., 2020 99. Reyes, M. ∙ Filbin, M.R. ∙ Bhattacharyya, R.P. ... An immune-cell signature of bacterial sepsis Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :333-340 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, blood monocytes isolated from COVID-19 patients showed a blunted cytokine response to LPS stimulation, particularly monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 4 D). Accordingly, HLA-DR lo monocyte clusters (0, 2, and 6) were detected almost exclusively in severe COVID-19 ( Figure 4 E). We next analyzed time-dependent cluster occupancies per patient in cohort 2 ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Activated HLA-DR hi CD83 hi monocytes (cluster 1) were found in all cases of mild COVID-19, even at late time points ( Figures 4 E and 4F). In contrast, HLA-DR lo CD163 hi monocytes (cluster 2) were present mainly early in severe disease, while HLA-DR lo S100A hi monocytes (cluster 0) dominated the late phase of disease ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Violin plots of ISG ( Figure S3 D) and visualization of marker genes ( Figure S3 E) indicated differential expression patterns of IFN signature genes in individual monocyte clusters. To reveal the kinetics of ISG expression, we plotted the expression of ISG15 and IFI6 in the complete monocyte population for all patients that had been sampled at least twice ( Figure 4 G). Expression levels were highest at early time points and consistently decreased over time, clearly indicating that the IFN response in COVID-19 is inversely linked to disease severity and time ( Figures S3 F and S3G). In contrast, decreased expression of HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1 in severe COVID-19 is evident early on and sustained over time.
Transcription factor prediction indicated a STAT signaling-driven gene expression program in monocytes in COVID-19 ( Figure 4 H), with additional regulation by CEBPD and CEBPE, which have been implicated in gene expression programs of sepsis-associated monocytes ( Reyes et al., 2020 99. Reyes, M. ∙ Filbin, M.R. ∙ Bhattacharyya, R.P. ... An immune-cell signature of bacterial sepsis Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :333-340 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). STAT3 was predicted as a specific regulator of genes enriched in HLA-DR lo CD163 hi and HLA-DR lo S100A hi monocytes (clusters 2 and 0), in line with their immunosuppressive phenotype.
Taken together, dynamic changes of monocyte phenotypes were associated with COVID-19 disease severity and time after onset of disease.
PBMCs derived from blood samples of patients with severe COVID-19 contained two distinct clusters of LDNs ( Figures 2 A, clusters 5 and 6, and 2 D, clusters 5 and 6). LDNs were slightly more frequent in cohort 1, and we analyzed these cells in more detail. Subsampling of all LDNs ( Figure 5 A; Table S1 ) and re-clustering the cells revealed 8 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Table S4 ). Based on published markers for pro- and pre-neutrophils, and mature neutrophils ( Kwok et al., 2020 57. Kwok, I. ∙ Becht, E. ∙ Xia, Y. ...

Rev. 2016; 273 :48-60 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) we identified clusters 4 and 6 as CD81 + SPN (CD43) + FUT4 (CD15) + CD63 + CEACAM8 (CD66b) + pro-neutrophils, clusters 3 and 5 as ITGAM (CD11b) + CEACAM8 (CD66b) + CD101 +/− pre-neutrophils, and the remaining clusters as mature neutrophils ( Figure S4 A). Accordingly, pro- and pre-neutrophils were enriched for transcriptional signatures of neutrophil progenitors derived from published single-cell data ( Figure 4 C) ( Pellin et al., 2019 91. Pellin, D. ∙ Loperfido, M. ∙ Baricordi, C. ... A comprehensive single cell transcriptional landscape of human hematopoietic progenitors Nat.

Decoding human fetal liver haematopoiesis Nature. 2019; 574 :365-371 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), and pro-neutrophils in clusters 4 and 6 showed the highest proportion of cells with a proliferative signature ( Figure S4 B). Clusters 0, 1, and 2 (originally in cluster 4 in Figure 2 A) expressed mature neutrophil markers FCGR3B (CD16) and MME (CD10) ( Figure S4 A).
Differential gene expression analysis for each cluster revealed extensive phenotypic heterogeneity within the LDN compartment ( Figure 5 B). LDNs mainly arise under pathological conditions, such as severe infection and sepsis in the context of emergency myelopoiesis ( Schultze et al., 2019 109. Schultze, J.L. ∙ Mass, E. ∙ Schlitzer, A. Emerging Principles in Myelopoiesis at Homeostasis and during Infection and Inflammation Immunity. 2019; 50 :288-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), and they have been associated with dysfunctional immune responses, marked by combined immunosuppression and inflammation ( Silvestre-Roig et al., 2019 113.

While LDN in cluster 1 expressed numerous ISGs ( ISG15 , IFITM1/3 , and RSAD2 ), cluster 4 (pro-neutrophils) expressed genes (e.g., MPO , ELANE , and PRTN3 ) that are involved in neutrophil extracellular trap formation ( Stiel et al., 2018 115.

Both pre-neutrophil clusters expressed PADI4 , another co-factor in NETosis ( Leshner et al., 2012 61. Leshner, M. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ Lewis, C. ... PAD4 mediated histone hypercitrullination induces heterochromatin decondensation and chromatin unfolding to form neutrophil extracellular trap-like structures Front. Immunol. 2012; 3 :307 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 D). NETs have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 ( Barnes et al., 2020 8.

Neutrophil extracellular traps in COVID-19 JCI Insight. 2020; 5 :e138999 PubMed Google Scholar ). Both pre-neutrophils (clusters 3 and 5) and pro-neutrophils expressed genes including CD24 , OLFM4 , LCN2 , and BPI , previously associated with poor outcome in sepsis ( Figures 5 B and S4 A) ( Kangelaris et al., 2015 50. Kangelaris, K.N. ∙ Prakash, A. ∙ Liu, K.D. ... Increased expression of neutrophil-related genes in patients with early sepsis-induced ARDS Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2015; 308 :L1102-L1113 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All LDNs also expressed high levels of alarmins S100A8 and S100A9 ( Figure 5 D), whereas other S100 genes (e.g., S100A4 and S100A12 ) were strongly induced in selected neutrophil clusters. Finally, known inhibitors of T cell activation, namely CD274 (PD-L1) and Arginase 1 ( ARG1 ) ( Bronte et al., 2003 13. Bronte, V. ∙ Serafini, P. ∙ Mazzoni, A. ...

Med. 2018; 10 eaat4162 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ) were highly expressed in neutrophils in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 5 E). ARG1 + neutrophils in sepsis patients were shown to deplete arginine and constrain T cell function in septic shock ( Darcy et al., 2014 25. Darcy, C.J. ∙ Minigo, G. ∙ Piera, K.A. ... Neutrophils with myeloid derived suppressor function deplete arginine and constrain T cell function in septic shock patients Crit. Care. 2014; 18 :R163 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) and were predictive of the development of nosocomial infections ( Uhel et al., 2017 121. Uhel, F. ∙ Azzaoui, I. ∙ Grégoire, M. ...

Care Med. 2017; 196 :315-327 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mature CD274 (PD-L1) + neutrophils (cluster 0) have been attributed suppressive functions in various conditions including HIV-1 infection ( Bowers et al., 2014 11. Bowers, N.L. ∙ Helton, E.S. ∙ Huijbregts, R.P.H. ... Immune suppression by neutrophils in HIV-1 infection: role of PD-L1/PD-1 pathway PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 :e1003993 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ), cancer ( Chun et al., 2015 21.

Spleen-derived IFN-γ induces generation of PD-L1 + -suppressive neutrophils during endotoxemia J. Leukoc. Biol. 2017; 102 :1401-1409 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and blood after LPS exposure ( de Kleijn et al., 2013 27. de Kleijn, S. ∙ Langereis, J.D. ∙ Leentjens, J. ... IFN-γ-stimulated neutrophils suppress lymphocyte proliferation through expression of PD-L1 PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e72249 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). ARG1 + cells were mainly immature neutrophils (clusters 3–6) and did not overlap with CD274 (PD-L1) expressing cells, indicating different populations of dysfunctional and potentially suppressive neutrophils in severe COVID-19.
LDNs recovered from PBMC fractions of COVID-19 patients revealed the presence of dysfunctional neutrophils and pointed toward multiple potentially deleterious pathways activated in severe COVID-19.
Alterations of the neutrophil compartment were further interrogated by mass cytometry of whole blood samples of COVID-19 patients (n = 8 mild + 9 severe, cohort 1), FLI patients (n = 8), and age- and gender-matched controls (n = 9) ( Table S1 ), using a panel designed to detect myeloid cell maturation and activation states as well as markers of immunosuppression or dysfunction ( Table S2 ). Unsupervised clustering analysis of all neutrophils in all samples revealed 10 major clusters ( Figure 6 A) of immature (clusters 2, 5, 6, and 7), mature (clusters 1, 3, and 4), and remaining clusters of low abundancy (clusters 8, 9, and 10). Based on their differential expression of CD11b, CD16, CD24, CD34, and CD38, clusters 5 and 6 were identified as pro-neutrophils and cluster 2 as pre-neutrophils ( Kwok et al., 2020 57. Kwok, I. ∙ Becht, E. ∙ Xia, Y. ... Combinatorial Single-Cell Analyses of Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitor Heterogeneity Reveals an Early Uni-potent Neutrophil Progenitor Immunity. 2020; S1074-7613 :30235-1 Google Scholar ; Ng et al., 2019 87. Ng, L.G. ∙ Ostuni, R. ∙ Hidalgo, A. Heterogeneity of neutrophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :255-265 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fourth immature cell cluster (7) showed very low expression of CD11b and CD16, reminiscent of pro-neutrophils, but lacking CD34, CD38, and CD24 ( Figure 6 A), suggesting a hitherto unappreciated pro-neutrophil-like population. The mature neutrophils segregated into non-activated (cluster 1), partially activated (cluster 3), and highly activated cells (cluster 4), based on the loss of CD62L and upregulation of CD64, as well as signs of proliferative activity (Ki67 + ) ( Figure 6 A).
Neutrophils from COVID-19 patients clearly separated from those of controls and also FLI patients in UMAP analysis ( Figure 6 B), and neutrophils in patients with severe COVID-19 were distinct from those of patients with mild disease ( Figure 6 B). Cells from control donors accumulated in areas enriched for mature non-activated cells (cluster 1) and immature pre-neutrophil-like cells (cluster 2). In contrast, neutrophils from FLI patients were mainly mature non-activated (cluster 1) and mature highly activated (cluster 4) cells. Neutrophils from COVID-19, particularly from patients with severe disease, primarily occupied immature pre- and pro-neutrophil-like clusters. Plotting cell cluster-specific surface marker expression onto the UMAPs ( Figure 6 C) as well as statistical analyses of cell cluster distribution and surface marker expression among different patient groups supported these observations ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Samples from FLI patients contain a high proportion of highly activated mature neutrophils, but barely any immature neutrophils. In contrast, severe COVID-19 is associated with the appearance of immature pre- and pro-neutrophils ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Interestingly, immature cell clusters in severe COVID-19 showed signs of recent activation like upregulation of CD64 ( Mortaz et al., 2018 85. Mortaz, E. ∙ Alipoor, S.D. ∙ Adcock, I.M. ... Update on neutrophil function in severe inflammation Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :2171 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ), RANK, and RANKL ( Riegel et al., 2012 101. Riegel, A. ∙ Maurer, T. ∙ Prior, B. ... Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils express RANK and are activated by its ligand, RANKL Eur. J. Immunol. 2012; 42 :975-981 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as reduced CD62L expression ( Mortaz et al., 2018 85. Mortaz, E. ∙ Alipoor, S.D. ∙ Adcock, I.M. ... Update on neutrophil function in severe inflammation Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :2171 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to loss of CD62L, immature and mature neutrophils from severe COVID-19 showed elevated PD-L1 expression compared to control samples ( Figure 6 E). Indeed, CD62L downregulation and high PD-L1 expression has been frequently associated with suppressive function of neutrophils and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) ( Bronte et al., 2016 14.

Lymphoma. 2015; 56 :2251-2263 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, a recent study described a high abundance of similar immature and dysfunctional CD64 + and PD-L1 + neutrophils in sepsis patients ( Meghraoui-Kheddar et al., 2020 76. Meghraoui-Kheddar, A. ∙ Chousterman, B.G. ∙ Guillou, N. ... Two new immature and dysfunctional neutrophil cell subsets define a predictive signature of sepsis useable in clinical practice bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces major alterations in the neutrophil compartment. While neutrophils in FLI patients display a mature activated phenotype, a release of immature neutrophils with phenotypic signs of immunosuppression and dysfunction is a hallmark of severe COVID-19.
We next assessed the dynamics of the changes within the myeloid cell compartment over time. We grouped samples according to collection time as “early” (within the first 10 days) or late (during the following 20 days) after onset of symptoms. In both cohorts, we observed a tendency toward (cohort 1) or significantly higher (cohort 2) proportions of granulocytes in severe versus mild COVID-19 patients, both at early and late time points ( Figure S5 A). We observed a persistent release of immature neutrophils (e.g., cluster 6) in severe COVID-19 ( Figure S5 B) showing high expression of CD64 and PD-L1, but downregulation of CD62L as a sign of activation, dysfunction, and immunosuppression ( Figure S5 C). In addition, severe COVID-19 patients show further increased frequencies of mature, partially activated neutrophils (cluster 3) at later time periods ( Figure S5 B). Thus, the neutrophil compartment of severe COVID-19 patients is characterized by a combination of persistent signs of inflammation and immunosuppression, which is reminiscent of long-term post-traumatic complications ( Hesselink et al., 2019 38. Hesselink, L. ∙ Spijkerman, R. ∙ van Wessem, K.J.P. ... Neutrophil heterogeneity and its role in infectious complications after severe trauma World J. Emerg. Surg. 2019; 14 :24 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also analyzed time-dependent phenotypic changes in the monocyte compartment by mass cytometry. Non-classical monocytes started to recover in COVID-19 patients during the later stages of the disease ( Figure S5 A). HLA-DR hi CD11c hi monocyte cell clusters also declined at later time points in mild COVID-19 ( Figures S5 D–S5F), which correlates well with the longitudinal changes of IFI6 and ISG15 as well as HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1 expression profiles ( Figures 4 G and S3 F). In contrast, overall proportions of HLA-DR hi CD11c hi monocytes in severe COVID-19 remained low throughout the course of the disease. Proportions of CD10 hi macrophage-like cluster 10 and CD226 + CD69 + monocytes were generally higher at later stages in severe COVID-19, which resembled the kinetics of HLA-DR lo S100A hi monocytes identified by scRNA-seq ( Figure 4 F). This indicates a prolonged alternative activation of monocytes in severe COVID-19 ( Figure S5 E).
Whole blood CyTOF analysis (cohort 1) clearly indicated very distinct phenotypic alterations of the neutrophil compartment in mild and severe forms of COVID-19. To further delineate the underlying transcriptional programs, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on fresh whole blood samples of 23 individuals (34 samples, cohort 2, Table S1 ). Integrated visualization of all samples of cohort 2 (fresh/frozen PBMCs, fresh whole blood, 229,731 cells, Figure S6 A) revealed the expected blood leukocyte distribution, including granulocytes ( Figures 7 A and S6 A; Table S4 ). Cell-type distribution identified by scRNA-seq profiles ( Figure S6 B) strongly correlated with MCFC characterization of the same samples ( Figure S6 C). For further analysis of the granulocyte compartment, we first combined the whole blood samples with the fresh PBMCs to guide the clustering of all major immune cells resulting in a total of 122,954 cells ( Figure 7 A). From these samples, we identified all neutrophil clusters and extracted the cells derived from whole blood for subsampling, which revealed a structure of 9 clusters (n = 58,383 cells) ( Figures 7 B and 7C).
Using marker- and data-driven approaches as applied to LDN ( Figure 5 D and S4 A), we identified FUT4 (CD15 ) + CD63 + CD66b + pro-neutrophils, ITGAM (CD11b) + CD101 + pre-neutrophils, along with 7 mature neutrophil clusters ( Figures 7 B–7D and S6 D; Table S4 ). Heterogeneous expression of various markers involved in mature neutrophil function including CXCR2 , FCGR2A (CD32), FCGR1A (CD64), or MME (CD10), pointed toward distinct functionalities within the neutrophil compartment ( Figures 7 E, S6 D, and S6E). Seven of the nine neutrophil clusters identified in whole blood in cohort 2 could also be mapped to the fresh PBMC transcriptomes in cohort 1 ( Figure S6 F), indicating that scRNA-seq of fresh PBMC in COVID-19 patients reveals relevant parts of the neutrophil space. The transcriptional phenotype of pro- and pre-neutrophils (cluster 8+9) was corroborated in cohort 2 ( Figures 7 B–7D and S6 D).
Heatmap and UMAP visualization of the cell type distribution identified pro- and pre-neutrophils mainly at late time points in severe COVID-19 ( Figures 7 F and 7G). Furthermore, mature neutrophils with a high IFN-signature (cluster 1) were associated with severe COVID-19 ( Figures 7 E and S6 G). This cluster was also enriched for markers identified by CyTOF as differentially expressed in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 6 ), such as elevated expression of CD274 (PD-L1) and FCGR1A (CD64) ( Figure 7 H). In addition to CD274 , cells in cluster 1 expressed genes indicative of a potentially suppressive or anti-inflammatory state, including ZC3H12A ( Figure 7 E), which is known to suppress hepatitis C virus replication and virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production ( Lin et al., 2014 65. Lin, R.-J. ∙ Chu, J.-S. ∙ Chien, H.-L. ... MCPIP1 suppresses hepatitis C virus replication and negatively regulates virus-induced proinflammatory cytokine responses J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :4159-4168 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cluster 2 was also enriched for cells from COVID-19 patients, mainly from severe but also mild cases ( Figures 7 F and 7G).
Gene signatures from granulocytic MDSC ( Bayik et al., 2020 9. Bayik, D. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Park, C. ... Myeloid-derived suppressor cell subsets drive glioblastoma growth in a sex-specific manner Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :1210-1225 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CD274 (PD-L1) + neutrophils after LPS exposure ( de Kleijn et al., 2013 27. de Kleijn, S. ∙ Langereis, J.D. ∙ Leentjens, J. ... IFN-γ-stimulated neutrophils suppress lymphocyte proliferation through expression of PD-L1 PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e72249 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), both shown to be immunosuppressive, were enriched in clusters 1, 2, and 6, which mainly harbor cells from severe COVID-19. This indicates a suppressive functionality of these cells in severe COVID-19 ( Figure 7 I). Predictions of transcription factor (TF)-based regulation of the cluster-specific gene signatures separated mature neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 (cluster 1) and control patients (cluster 0) ( Figure 7 J). IFN-response genes are mainly controlled by STAT and IRF TFs, whereas the transcriptional signature of cluster 0 is mainly driven by the CEBP TF family. The TF network underlying the transcriptional difference in pro-neutrophils is mainly driven by E2F family members and pre-neutrophils mainly depend on ETS TFs ( Figure S6 H).
Pseudotime analysis strongly supported the differentiation trajectory from pro-neutrophils (cluster 8) via pre-neutrophils (cluster 6) to mature neutrophils in cluster 2 and 1 ( Figures S6 I and S6J). Particularly CD274 (PD-1L) was enriched in cluster 1 compared to cluster 2, supporting the potential of neutrophils to progress toward a suppressive phenotype in severe COVID-19 ( Figure S6 J). Interestingly, CD177 is expressed in pre-neutrophils and persisting in cluster 1 further highlighting the newly emerging character of this cluster ( Volkmann et al., 2020 125. Volkmann, J. ∙ Schmitz, J. ∙ Nordlohne, J. ... Kidney injury enhances renal G-CSF expression and modulates granulopoiesis and human neutrophil CD177 in vivo Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2020; 199 :97-108 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, we studied whether the persistent emergence of immature, potentially dysfunctional neutrophils in severe COVID-19 patients can be captured under routine diagnostic conditions. Therefore, samples of 32 COVID-19 patients ( Table S1 , cohort 1) were characterized by routine hematology analyses using a clinical flow cytometry system (Sysmex analyzer). Indeed, the assumption of rescue myelopoiesis in severe COVID-19 was supported by significantly higher counts in the population of immature granulocytes (IG, representing promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes) in this patient group ( Figure 7 K). We also found significant differences in the neutrophil compartment, when analyzing the width of dispersion with respect to granularity, activity, and cell volume defined as NE-WX, NE-WY, and NE-WZ, respectively. As compared to patients with mild course, severely ill patients displayed increases in width of dispersion of activity and cell volume as surrogates for increased cellular heterogeneity, immaturity, and dysregulation in severe COVID-19 ( Figure 7 K), resembling previously described alterations in sepsis patients ( Stiel et al., 2016 114. Stiel, L. ∙ Delabranche, X. ∙ Galoisy, A.C. ... Neutrophil Fluorescence: A New Indicator of Cell Activation During Septic Shock-Induced Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Crit. Care Med. 2016; 44 :e1132-e1136 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, neutrophils of severe COVID-19 patients were partially dysfunctional, because their oxidative burst upon stimulation with standardized stimuli ( E. coli or PMA) was strongly impaired in comparison to control and mild COVID-19 neutrophils, whereas phagocytic activity was preserved ( Figure 7 L; Table S1 ).
Collectively, the neutrophil compartment in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients is characterized by the appearance of LDN, FUT4 (CD15) + CD63 + CD66b + pro-neutrophils, and ITGAM (CD11b) + CD101 + pre-neutrophils, reminiscent of emergency myelopoiesis, as well as CD274 (PD-L1) + ZC3H12A + mature neutrophils reminiscent of gMDSC-like cells, which might exert suppressive or anti-inflammatory functions.

Section: Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 infection generally causes mild disease in the majority of individuals, however, ∼10%–20% of COVID-19 patients progress to severe disease with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The reported case-fatality rates among patients with critical illness and respiratory failure vary, with a mean of ∼25% ( Quah et al., 2020 97. Quah, P. ∙ Li, A. ∙ Phua, J. Mortality rates of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit: a systematic review of the emerging literature Crit. Care. 2020; 24 :285 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dysregulated immune responses have been described in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Chua et al., 2020 20. Chua, R.L. ∙ Lukassen, S. ∙ Trump, S. ...

J. 2020; Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, detailed knowledge of the cellular and molecular processes that drive progression from mild disease to potentially fatal courses of COVID-19 is urgently needed to identify predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
Here, we employed four complementary technologies at single-cell resolution to assess alterations in the systemic immune response in mild or severe courses of COVID-19. We analyzed a total of 53 patients (161 samples) from two independent cohorts collected at two university medical centers in Germany ( Kurth et al., 2020 55. Kurth, F. ∙ Roennefarth, M. ∙ Thibeault, C. ... Studying the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019: a protocol for the Berlin prospective COVID-19 patient cohort (Pa-COVID-19) Infection. 2020; 48 :619-626 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Combining single-cell transcriptomics with single-cell proteomics, using different technological platforms in two independent patient cohorts, provided a detailed view of the systemic immune responses in COVID-19 and allowed for cross-validation and in-depth interrogation of key findings. The results were further supported by additional routine diagnostics lab measurements and functional assays, linking the results of the exploratory investigations to functional phenotypes and clinically relevant diagnostics.
This multipronged approach revealed drastic changes within the myeloid cell compartment during COVID-19, particularly in patients with a severe course of disease. Early activation of HLA-DR hi CD11c hi / HLA-DR hi CD83 hi monocytes with a strong antiviral IFN-signature was a hallmark of mild COVID-19, which receded during the natural course of disease. In contrast, HLA-DR lo dysfunctional monocytes along with clear evidence of emergency myelopoiesis with release of immature neutrophils including pro- and pre-neutrophils into the circulation marked severe COVID-19. Furthermore, we identified neutrophils in severe COVID-19 with transcriptional programs reminiscent of dysfunction and immunosuppression not observed in controls or patients with mild COVID-19. Thus, defective monocyte activation and dysregulated myelopoiesis may contribute to severe disease course and ARDS development ( Middleton et al., 2020 83.

Previous immunophenotyping studies have reported an increase of inflammatory monocytes with a strong IFN-response in COVID-19 ( Liao et al., 2020 63. Liao, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Yuan, J. ... Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :842-844 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ; Merad and Martin, 2020 80.

Overly Exuberant Innate Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection SSRN Electron. J. 2020; Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils appear to dominate inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs, and resident alveolar macrophages are replaced by inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Chua et al., 2020 20. Chua, R.L. ∙ Lukassen, S. ∙ Trump, S. ... COVID-19 severity correlates with airway epithelium-immune cell interactions identified by single-cell analysis Nat.

Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :842-844 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we report substantial time- and disease severity-dependent alterations of the monocyte compartment in COVID-19. Marked depletion of CD14 lo CD16 hi non-classical monocytes observed in all COVID-19 patients, but not in patients with SARS-CoV-2 negative FLI ( Figure 1 D), is in line with previous reports on COVID-19, and other severe viral infections ( Lüdtke et al., 2016 69. Lüdtke, A. ∙ Ruibal, P. ∙ Becker-Ziaja, B. ... Ebola Virus Disease Is Characterized by Poor Activation and Reduced Levels of Circulating CD16+ Monocytes J. Infect.

Different phenotypes of non-classical monocytes associated with systemic inflammation, endothelial alteration and hepatic compromise in patients with dengue Immunology. 2019; 156 :147-163 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single-cell proteomics and transcriptomics revealed a transient increase in highly activated CD14 + HLA-DR hi CD11c hi ( HLA-DRA hi CD83 hi ) monocytes in mild COVID-19. This was similar in patients presenting with common cold or FLI, but absent in severe COVID-19 ( Figures 3 and 4 ). In contrast, in severe COVID-19, monocytes showed low expression of HLA-DR, and high levels of MAFB , PLBD1 , and CD163 , all of which are associated with anti-inflammatory macrophage functions ( Bronte et al., 2016 14.

Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic macrophage populations Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4383 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Low HLA-DR expression on monocytes is an established surrogate marker of immunosuppression in sepsis ( Venet et al., 2020 123. Venet, F. ∙ Demaret, J. ∙ Gossez, M. ... Myeloid cells in sepsis-acquired immunodeficiency Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2020; Published online March 23, 2020 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Elevated HLA-DR lo monocytes have been associated with an increased risk of infectious complications after trauma ( Hoffmann et al., 2017 40. Hoffmann, S. ∙ Harms, H. ∙ Ulm, L. ..., PREDICT Investigators Stroke-induced immunodepression and dysphagia independently predict stroke-associated pneumonia - The PREDICT study J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2017; 37 :3671-3682 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) and fatal outcome in septic shock ( Monneret et al., 2006 84. Monneret, G. ∙ Lepape, A. ∙ Voirin, N. ... Persisting low monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR expression predicts mortality in septic shock Intensive Care Med. 2006; 32 :1175-1183 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, the HLA-DR lo CD163 + monocytes showed enrichment of genes associated with poor prognosis in sepsis patients, including PLAC8 ( Maslove et al., 2019 73. Maslove, D.M. ∙ Shapira, T. ∙ Tyryshkin, K. ... Validation of diagnostic gene sets to identify critically ill patients with sepsis J. Crit. Care. 2019; 49 :92-98 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ) and MPO ( Schrijver et al., 2017 108. Schrijver, I.T. ∙ Kemperman, H. ∙ Roest, M. ... Myeloperoxidase can differentiate between sepsis and non-infectious SIRS and predicts mortality in intensive care patients with SIRS Intensive Care Med. Exp. 2017; 5 :43 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 B). In line with this dysfunctional phenotype, PLAC8 was recently shown to suppress production of IL-1β and IL-18 ( Segawa et al., 2018 112. Segawa, S. ∙ Kondo, Y. ∙ Nakai, Y. ... Placenta Specific 8 Suppresses IL-18 Production through Regulation of Autophagy and Is Associated with Adult Still Disease J. Immunol. 2018; 201 :3534-3545 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, we observed that inflammatory cytokine production, including IL-1β release, was impaired in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 4 ). CD14 + HLA-DR lo monocytes have also been implicated with immunosuppression in cancer patients ( Bronte et al., 2016 14. Bronte, V. ∙ Brandau, S. ∙ Chen, S.H. ...

While exhibiting anti-inflammatory features, especially in the early stages of severe disease ( Figures S3 C–S3F), persistently high expression of CD226 and CD69 may promote tissue infiltration and organ dysfunction ( Davison et al., 2017 26.

Acute pathological insults, such as trauma or severe infections, trigger a process referred to as emergency myelopoiesis to replenish functional granulocytes and other hematopoietic cells. Emergency myelopoiesis is characterized by the mobilization of immature myeloid cells, which are often linked to immunosuppressive functions ( Loftus et al., 2018 66. Loftus, T.J. ∙ Mohr, A.M. ∙ Moldawer, L.L. Dysregulated myelopoiesis and hematopoietic function following acute physiologic insult Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2018; 25 :37-43 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schultze et al., 2019 109. Schultze, J.L. ∙ Mass, E. ∙ Schlitzer, A. Emerging Principles in Myelopoiesis at Homeostasis and during Infection and Inflammation Immunity. 2019; 50 :288-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, emergence of suppressive myeloid cells including neutrophils, often referred to as granulocytic MDSCs, has been observed during sepsis and severe influenza ( Darcy et al., 2014 25.

Invest. 2008; 118 :4036-4048 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). LDN in PBMC fractions in severe COVID-19 contained immature neutrophils, including pro- and pre-neutrophils, which was not observed in mild cases ( Figure 5 ). These immature LDNs showed a surface marker and gene expression profile reminiscent of granulocytic MDSCs including genes such as S100A12 , S100A9 , MMP8 , ARG1 ( Uhel et al., 2017 121. Uhel, F. ∙ Azzaoui, I. ∙ Grégoire, M. ... Early expansion of circulating granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells predicts development of nosocomial infections in patients with sepsis Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2017; 196 :315-327 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), and OLFM4 , which has been recently associated with immunopathogenesis in sepsis ( Alder et al., 2017 3. Alder, M.N. ∙ Opoka, A.M. ∙ Lahni, P. ... Olfactomedin-4 Is a Candidate Marker for a Pathogenic Neutrophil Subset in Septic Shock Crit. Care Med. 2017; 45 :e426-e432 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Emergence of pro-neutrophils in severe COVID-19 was also detected by single-cell proteomics on whole blood samples. Strikingly, both immature and the mature neutrophils showed increased expression of CD64 and PD-L1 ( Figures 6 and S5 ), similar to recently described alterations in sepsis ( Meghraoui-Kheddar et al., 2020 76. Meghraoui-Kheddar, A. ∙ Chousterman, B.G. ∙ Guillou, N. ... Two new immature and dysfunctional neutrophil cell subsets define a predictive signature of sepsis useable in clinical practice bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). In addition to the altered phenotype, we also observed an altered functionality. Neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 showed an impaired oxidative burst response, while their phagocytic capacity was preserved ( Figure 7 ).
Single-cell transcriptomics of whole blood samples revealed mature activated neutrophils in both mild and severe COVID-19 ( Figure 7 B, cluster 2), however, expression of CD274 (PD-L1) was only found in severe COVID-19 (cluster 1), and it increased in later stages of the disease. Expression of PD-L1 on neutrophils has been associated with T cell suppression ( Bowers et al., 2014 11. Bowers, N.L. ∙ Helton, E.S. ∙ Huijbregts, R.P.H. ...

Biol. 2017; 102 :1401-1409 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that neutrophils in severe COVID-19 might exert suppressive functions. Furthermore, the expression of CD177 on mature activated neutrophils and the identification of genes associated with anti-inflammatory functions ( CD274 and ZC3H12A ) suggest a model in which neutrophils emerging prematurely from the bone marrow are programmed toward an anti-inflammatory or even suppressive phenotype in severe COVID-19. The transcriptional programs induced in immature neutrophils, including pro- and pre-neutrophils, as well as in COVID-19-associated mature neutrophil clusters, align with other observations in severe COVID-19 patients, including increased NET formation ( Barnes et al., 2020 8.

In contrast, these transcriptional programs were not observed in patients with mild COVID-19 or in SARS-CoV-2 negative controls, even though the latter exhibited a range of comorbidities (e.g., COPD, type II diabetes).
Thus, defective or repressed monocyte activation combined with dysregulated myelopoiesis may cause a deleterious loop of continuous tissue inflammation and ineffective host defense.
The pathophysiological consequences of the dysfunctional phenotype of myeloid cells in severe COVID-19 remain unclear at this stage. It is, however, highly likely that they contribute to immunosuppression in critically ill patients, potentially leading to insufficient host defense, disbalanced inflammation, and increased susceptibility to superinfections. While our dual cohort study design provided robust and reproducible results concerning the alterations within the myeloid compartment in COVID-19, it is too early to speculate on the underlying mechanisms driving this response, such as genetics, lifestyle, comorbidities, environmental factors, or initial viral load ( Ellinghaus et al., 2020 31.

Med. 2020; Published online June 17, 2020 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Utilizing the herein established transcriptional and functional phenotypes of the myeloid cell compartment, it will likely be possible to estimate the potential contribution of the causes mentioned above in larger clinical studies in the future and to address potential upstream events of immune dysregulation in preclinical model systems as they become available ( Bao et al., 2020 7. Bao, L. ∙ Deng, W. ∙ Huang, B. ... The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice Nature. 2020; 583 :830-833 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cohen, 2020 23. Cohen, J. From mice to monkeys, animals studied for coronavirus answers Science. 2020; 368 :221-222 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, in future studies it will be interesting to dissect whether the myeloid subsets in COVID-19 are anti-inflammatory or even capable of suppressing other immune cells, and which pathways might be mainly involved. Clearly, PD-L1 is a prime candidate ( Bowers et al., 2014 11. Bowers, N.L. ∙ Helton, E.S. ∙ Huijbregts, R.P.H. ... Immune suppression by neutrophils in HIV-1 infection: role of PD-L1/PD-1 pathway PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 :e1003993 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ; Castell et al., 2019 18. Castell, S.D. ∙ Harman, M.F. ∙ Morón, G. ... Neutrophils which migrate to lymph nodes modulate CD4+ T cell response by a PD-L1 dependent mechanism Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :105 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ; de Kleijn et al., 2013 27. de Kleijn, S. ∙ Langereis, J.D. ∙ Leentjens, J. ... IFN-γ-stimulated neutrophils suppress lymphocyte proliferation through expression of PD-L1 PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e72249 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Langereis et al., 2017 58. Langereis, J.D. ∙ Pickkers, P. ∙ de Kleijn, S. ... Spleen-derived IFN-γ induces generation of PD-L1 + -suppressive neutrophils during endotoxemia J. Leukoc. Biol. 2017; 102 :1401-1409 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Collectively, our data link a striking appearance of immature and dysfunctional cells, in both the monocyte and neutrophil compartment, to disease severity in COVID-19. Consequently, the development of treatments and prevention strategies for severe COVID-19 may benefit from insights gained in other fields such as oncology, which have successfully applied therapies targeting suppressive myeloid cells.

Samples from patients with COVID-19 were collected within two cohort studies ( Kurth et al., 2020 55. Kurth, F. ∙ Roennefarth, M. ∙ Thibeault, C. ... Studying the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019: a protocol for the Berlin prospective COVID-19 patient cohort (Pa-COVID-19) Infection. 2020; 48 :619-626 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) designed to allow deep molecular and immunological transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of COVID-19 in blood. Patients for which sufficient material was available for scRNA-seq, CyTOF or flow cytometry analysis, were included in this study. This study was designed to describe immunological deviations in COVID-19 patients without intention of the development of new treatments or new diagnostics, and therefore sample size estimation was not included in the original study design.
This study includes a subset of patients enrolled between March 2 and July 02 2020 in the Pa-COVID-19 study, a prospective observational cohort study assessing pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin ( Kurth et al., 2020 55.

Studying the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019: a protocol for the Berlin prospective COVID-19 patient cohort (Pa-COVID-19) Infection. 2020; 48 :619-626 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). The study is approved by the Institutional Review board of Charité (EA2/066/20). Written informed consent was provided by all patients or legal representatives for participation in the study. The patient population included in all analyses of cohort 1 consists of 10 control donors (samples collected in 2019 before SARS-CoV2 outbreak), 8 patients presenting with flu-like illness but tested SARS-CoV-2-negative, 25 mild and 29 severe COVID-19 patients ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Table S1 ). Information on age, sex, medication, and co-morbidities is listed in Table S1 . All COVID-19 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs and allocated to mild (WHO 2-4) or severe (5-7) disease according to the WHO clinical ordinal scale. We also included publicly available single-cell transcriptome data derived from 22 control samples into the analysis; 3 samples were derived from 10x Genomics, San Francisco, CA 94111, USA (5k_pbmc_v3: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.2/5k_pbmc_v3 , pbmc_10k_v3: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/pbmc_10k_v3 , pbmc_1k_v3: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/pbmc_1k_v3 ), 19 samples derived from Reyes et al.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review board of the University Hospital Bonn (073/19 and 134/20). After providing written informed consent, 19 control donors and 22 COVID-19 patients ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Table S1 ) were included in the study. In patients who were not able to consent at the time of study enrollment, consent was obtained after recovery. Information on age, sex, medication, and co-morbidities are listed in Table S1 . COVID-19 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs were recruited at the Medical Clinic I of the University Hospital Bonn between March 30 and June 17, 2020 and allocated to mild (WHO 2-4) or severe (5-7) disease according to the WHO clinical ordinal scale. Controls in cohort 2 were collected from healthy people or from otherwise hospitalized patients with a wide range of diseases and comorbidities including chronic inflammatory immune responses. These individuals were either tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, serologically negative or had no indication for acute COVID-19 disease based on clinical or laboratory parameters.
PBMC were isolated from heparinized whole blood by density centrifugation over Pancoll (density: 1.077 g/ml; PAN-Biotech). If the pellet was still slightly red, remaining CD235ab + cells (Erythrocytes) were depleted by Negative Selection ( MagniSort Thermo Fisher). Subsequently the PBMC were prepared for 3′scRNA-seq (10xGenomics) or cryopreserved and analyzed later.
In the Bonn cohort, scRNA-seq was performed on fresh whole blood, fresh PBMC and frozen PBMC. Briefly, PBMC were isolated from EDTA-treated or heparinized peripheral blood by density centrifugation over Pancoll or Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation (density: 1.077 g/ml). Cells were then washed with DPBS, directly prepared for scRNA-seq (BD Rhapsody) or cryopreserved in RPMI1640 with 40% FBS and 10% DMSO. Whole blood was prepared by treatment of 1ml peripheral blood with 10ml of RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend). After one wash in DPBS cells were directly processed for scRNA-seq (BD Rhapsody) or multi-color flow cytometry (MCFC). Frozen PBMC were recovered by rapidly thawing frozen cell suspensions in a 37°C water bath followed by immediate dilution in pre-warmed RPMI-1640+10% FBS (GIBCO) and centrifugation at 300 g for 5min. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640+10% FBS and processed for scRNA-seq. Antibody cocktails were cryopreserved as described before ( Schulz and Mei, 2019 110. Schulz, A.R. ∙ Mei, H.E. Surface barcoding of live PBMC for multiplexed mass cytometry Methods in Molecular Biology Humana Press Inc., 2019; 93-108 Google Scholar ).
All anti-human antibodies pre-conjugated to metal isotopes were obtained from Fluidigm Corporation (San Francisco, US). All remaining antibodies were obtained from the indicated companies as purified antibodies and in-house conjugation was done using the MaxPar X8 labeling kit (Fluidigm). Table S2 shows a detailed list of all antibodies used for panel 1 and panel 2.
500μl of whole blood (heparin) was fixed in 700μl of proteomic stabilizer (Smart Tube Inc., San Carlos, US) as described in the user manual and stored at −80°C until further processing. Whole blood samples were thawed in Thaw/Lyse buffer (Smart Tube Inc.). For barcoding antibodies recognizing human beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) were conjugated in house to 104 Pd, 106 Pd, 108 Pd, 110 Pd, 198 Pt ( Mei et al., 2015 77. Mei, H.E. ∙ Leipold, M.D. ∙ Schulz, A.R. ... Barcoding of live human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for multiplexed mass cytometry J. Immunol. 2015; 194 :2022-2031 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 78. Mei, H.E. ∙ Leipold, M.D. ∙ Maecker, H.T. Platinum-conjugated antibodies for application in mass cytometry Cytometry A. 2016; 89 :292-300 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schulz and Mei, 2019 110. Schulz, A.R. ∙ Mei, H.E. Surface barcoding of live PBMC for multiplexed mass cytometry Methods in Molecular Biology Humana Press Inc., 2019; 93-108 Google Scholar ). Up to 10 individual samples were stained using a staining buffer from Fluidigm with a combination of two different B2M antibodies for 30min at 4°C. Cells were washed and pooled for surface and intracellular staining.
For surface staining the barcoded and pooled samples were equally divided into two samples. Cells were resuspended in antibody staining cocktails for panel 1 or panel 2 respectively ( Table S2 ) and stained for 30min at 4°C. For secondary antibody staining of panel 2, cells were washed and stained with anti-APC 163 Dy for 30min at 4°C. After surface staining cells were washed with PBS and fixed overnight in PFA solution diluted in PBS to 2%.
For intracellular staining cells were washed twice with a permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, US) and stained with the respective antibodies diluted in a permeabilization buffer for 30min at room temperature. After washing, cells were stained with iridium intercalator (Fluidigm) diluted in 2% PFA for 20min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBS and then twice with ddH 2 O and kept at 4°C until mass cytometry measurement.
A minimum of 100,000 cells per sample and panel were acquired on a CyTOF2/Helios mass cytometer (Fluidigm). For normalization of the fcs files 1:10 EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm) were added. Cells were analyzed using a CyTOF2 upgraded to Helios specifications, with software version 6.7.1014, using a narrow bore injector. The instrument was tuned according to the manufacturer’s instructions with tuning solution (Fluidigm) and measurement of EQ four element calibration beads (Fluidigm) containing 140/142Ce, 151/153Eu, 165Ho and 175/176Lu served as a quality control for sensitivity and recovery. Directly prior to analysis, cells were resuspended in ddH2O, filtered through a 20-μm cell strainer (Celltrics, Sysmex), counted and adjusted to 5-8 x10 5 cells/ml. EQ four element calibration beads were added at a final concentration of 1:10 v/v of the sample volume to be able to normalize the data to compensate for signal drift and day-to-day changes in instrument sensitivity. Samples were acquired with a flow rate of 300-400 events/s. The lower convolution threshold was set to 400, with noise reduction mode turned on and cell definition parameters set at event duration of 10-150 pushes (push = 13μs). The resulting flow cytometry standard (FCS) files were normalized and randomized using the CyTOF software’s internal FCS-Processing module on the non-randomized (‘original’) data. The default settings in the software were used with time interval normalization (100 s/minimum of 50 beads) and passport version 2. Intervals with less than 50 beads per 100 s were excluded from the resulting FCS file.
1ml of fresh blood from control or COVID-19 donors was treated with 10ml of RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend). After RBC lysis, cells were washed with DPBS and 1-2 million cells were used for flow cytometry analysis. Cells were then stained for surface markers ( Table S3 ) in DPBS with BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer (Becton Dickinson) for 30min at 4°C. To distinguish live from dead cells, the cells were incubated with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Yellow Dead Cell Stain Kit (1:1000 – Thermo Scientific). Following staining and washing, the cell suspension was fixed with 4% PFA for 5min at room temperature to prevent any possible risk of contamination during acquisition of the samples. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a BD Symphony instrument (Becton Dickinson) configured with 5 lasers (UV, violet, blue, yellow-green, red).
Determination of neutrophil oxidative burst and phagocytosis was performed by flow cytometry using the CE/IVD PHAGOBURST and PHAGOTEST assay (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, heparinized whole blood was incubated with PMA, unlabeled opsonized E. coli bacteria or washing solution (negative control) at 37°C for 10min. Dihydrorhodamine (DHR 123) was then added for 10min, erythrocytes were lysed and DNA staining solution was added. The freely cell permeable nonfluorescent Dihydrorhodamine 123 becomes fluorescent when oxidized by reactive oxygen species. Stained samples were analyzed on a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) within less than 30min. The respiratory burst intensity in neutrophils was determined by analysis of increase in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the FL1 Channel in the stimulated samples compared to the unstimulated control.
For analysis of neutrophil phagocytic activity, heparinized whole blood was incubated with FITC-labeled opsonized E. coli bacteria for 10min at 37°C or 0°C (negative control). After incubation, the reaction was stopped, erythrocytes were lysed and the DNA staining solution was added. Stained samples were analyzed on a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) within less than 30min. The phagocytic activity of neutrophils was determined by the increase in MFI in the FL1 Channel in the stimulated sample compared to the unstimulated control. Data were analyzed using prism version 8. Mixed-effect-analysis and Sidak’s multiple comparison test was applied to report statistical differences of E.coli - and PMA-induced ROS production as well as phagocytosis between mild and severe COVID-19 patients.
Monocytes were isolated from frozen PBMCs by negative selection using the Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The purity of isolated cells was assessed by BD Canto 2 flow cytometer, and preparations with > 85% purity were used for experiments. Monocytes were resuspended in complete RPMI1640 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Pan Biotech), 10 U/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and stimulated for 8h with LPS (1 ng/ml; TLRpure; Innaxon, UK). After stimulation, cell-free supernatants were collected and tested for IL-1β, IFNγ, and TNFα, respectively, using the cytokine bead assay Legend-Plex Mix&Match inflammation panel 1 kit (Biolegend, USA). Cytokine-bound beads were measured with a BD Canto 2 flow cytometer and analyzed using Legend-Plex Software 8.0 (Biolegend, USA).
Blood samples were collected into K 3 EDTA evacuated plastic tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and were subsequently analyzed using Sysmex XN-10 hematology analyzers within a XN-2000 or XN-9100 configuration (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) as previously described ( Stiel et al., 2016 114. Stiel, L. ∙ Delabranche, X. ∙ Galoisy, A.C. ... Neutrophil Fluorescence: A New Indicator of Cell Activation During Septic Shock-Induced Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Crit. Care Med. 2016; 44 :e1132-e1136 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immature granulocytes (IG) were quantified by automated flow cytometry using the Sysmex WBC differential channel in XN-10 hematology analyzers within a XN-2000 or XN-9100 configuration (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). Whole blood was treated with LysercellWDF for cell permeabilization and stained with the nucleic acid polymethine fluorescent dye FluorocellWDF according to Sysmex-proprietary protocols without modifications. Subsequent differentiation of white blood cells into lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and immature granulocytes was achieved by flow cytometry using a 663 nm laser. The cell populations’ distinct forward-scattered light (FSC = NE-WZ, i.e., cell volume), side-scattered light (SSC = NE-WX, i.e., granularity), and side-fluorescent light (SFL = NE-WY, i.e., nucleic acid content) properties allowed determining the width of neutrophil cytometric dispersions applying Sysmex-proprietary algorithms. Data were analyzed using prism version 8. Mann Whitney test was used to report differences in IG count, whereas mixed-effect-analysis and Sidak’s multiple comparison test was applied to report statistical differences of NE-WX, NE-WY and NE-WZ between mild and severe COVID-19 patients.
PBMC were isolated and prepared as described above. Afterward, patient samples were hashtagged with TotalSeq-A antibodies (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for TotalSeq™-A antibodies and cell hashing with 10x Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3.1. 50μL cell suspension with 1x10 6 cells were resuspended in staining buffer (2% BSA, Jackson Immuno Research; 0.01% Tween-20, Sigma-Aldrich; 1x DPBS, GIBCO) and 5 μL Human TruStain FcX™ FcBlocking (Biolegend) reagent were added. The blocking was performed for 10min at 4°C. In the next step 1μg unique TotalSeq-A antibody was added to each sample and incubated for 30min at 4°C. After the incubation time 1.5mL staining buffer were added and centrifuged for 5min at 350 g and 4°C. Washing was repeated for a total of 3 washes. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in an appropriate volume of 1x DPBS (GIBCO), passed through a 40μm mesh (Flowmi™ Cell Strainer, Merck) and counted, using a Neubauer Hemocytometer (Marienfeld). Cell counts were adjusted and hashtagged cells were pooled equally. The cell suspension was super-loaded, with 50,000 cells, in the Chromium™ Controller for partitioning single cells into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-Emulsions (GEMs). Single Cell 3′ reagent kit v3.1 was used for reverse transcription, cDNA amplification and library construction of the gene expression libraries (10x Genomics) following the detailed protocol provided by 10x Genomics. Hashtag libraries were prepared according to the cell hashing protocol for 10x Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3.1 provided by Biolegend, including primer sequences and reagent specifications. Biometra Trio Thermal Cycler was used for amplification and incubation steps (Analytik Jena). Libraries were quantified by Qubit™ 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher) and quality was checked using 2100 Bioanalyzer with High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent). Sequencing was performed in paired-end mode with a S1 and S2 flow cell (2 × 50 cycles) using NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina).
Whole transcriptome analyses, using the BD Rhapsody Single-Cell Analysis System (BD, Biosciences) were performed on PBMC and whole blood samples prepared as described above. Cells from each sample were labeled with sample tags (BD Human Single-Cell Multiplexing Kit) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, a total number of 1x10 6 cells were resuspended in 180μl of Stain Buffer (FBS) (BD PharMingen). The sample tags were added to the respective samples and incubated for 20min at room temperature. After incubation, 200μl stain buffer was added to each sample and centrifuged for 5min at 300 g and 4°C. Samples were washed one more time. Subsequently cells were resuspended in 300μl of cold BD Sample Buffer and counted using Improved Neubauer Hemocytometer (INCYTO). Labeled samples were pooled equally in 650μl cold BD Sample Buffer. For each pooled sample two BD Rhapsody cartridges were super-loaded with approximately 60,000 cells each. Single cells were isolated using Single-Cell Capture and cDNA Synthesis with the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (BD Biosciences). cDNA libraries were prepared using the BD Rhapsody Whole Transcriptome Analysis Amplification Kit following the BD Rhapsody System mRNA Whole Transcriptome Analysis (WTA) and Sample Tag Library Preparation Protocol (BD Biosciences). The final libraries were quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer with the Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher) and the size-distribution was measured using the Agilent high sensitivity D5000 assay on a TapeStation 4200 system (Agilent technologies). Sequencing was performed in paired-end mode (2 ∗ 75 cycles) on a NovaSeq 6000 and NextSeq 500 System (Illumina) with NovaSeq 6000 S2 Reagent Kit (200 cycles) and NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 (150 Cycles) chemistry, respectively.
CellRanger v3.1.0 (10x Genomics) was used to process scRNA-seq. To generate a digital gene expression (DGE) matrix for each sample, we mapped their reads to a combined reference of GRCh38 genome and SARS-CoV-2 genome and recorded the number of UMIs for each gene in each cell.
After demultiplexing of bcl files using Bcl2fastq2 V2.20 from Illumina and quality control, paired-end scRNA-seq reads were filtered for valid cell barcodes using the barcode whitelist provided by BD. Cutadapt 1.16 was then used to trim NexteraPE-PE adaptor sequences where needed and to filter reads for a PHRED score of 20 or above ( Martin, 2011 72. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. J. 2011; 17 :10 Crossref Google Scholar ). Then, STAR 2.6.1b was used for alignment against the Gencode v27 reference genome ( Dobin et al., 2013 30. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (10784) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dropseq-tools 2.0.0 were used to quantify gene expression and collapse to UMI count data ( https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/ ). For hashtag-oligo based demultiplexing of single-cell transcriptomes and subsequent assignment of cell barcodes to their sample of origin the respective multiplexing tag sequences were added to the reference genome and quantified as well.
ScRNA-seq UMI count matrices were imported to R 3.6.2 and gene expression data analysis was performed using the R/Seurat package 3.1.4 ( Butler et al., 2018 15. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (1826) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 37. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Demultiplexing of cells was performed using the HTODemux function implemented in Seurat.
We excluded cells based on the following quality criteria: more than 25% mitochondrial reads, more than 25% HBA/HBB gene reads, less than 250 expressed genes or more than 5,000 expressed genes and less than 500 detected transcripts. We further excluded genes that were expressed in less than five cells. In addition, mitochondrial genes have been excluded from further analysis.
LogNormalization (Seurat function) was applied before downstream analysis. The original gene counts for each cell were normalized by total UMI counts, multiplied by 10,000 (TP10K) and then log transformed by log10(TP10k+1).
After normalization, the count data was scaled regressing for total UMI counts and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed based on the 2,000 most variable features identified using the vst method implemented in Seurat. Subsequently, the scRNA-seq data from cohort 1 was integrated with publicly available 10x scRNaseq data of healthy controls using the ‘harmony’ algorithm ( Korsunsky et al., 2019 52. Korsunsky, I. ∙ Millard, N. ∙ Fan, J. ... Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1289-1296 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the first 20 principal components to correct for technical differences in the gene expression counts of the different data sources (Control samples from Reyes et al. (2020) 99. Reyes, M. ∙ Filbin, M.R. ∙ Bhattacharyya, R.P. ... An immune-cell signature of bacterial sepsis Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :333-340 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar , 10x v3.1 PBMC benchmarking data from healthy controls and 10x v3.1 scRNA-seq data from cohort 1). We downloaded the count matrices for the publicly available scRNA-seq data and filtered the cells using the above-mentioned quality criteria prior to data integration. For two-dimensional data visualization we performed UMAP based on the first 20 dimensions of the ‘harmony’ data reduction. The cells were clustered using the Louvain algorithm based on the first 20 ‘harmony” dimensions with a resolution of 0.4.
Differential expression (DE) tests were performed using FindMarkers/FindAllMarkers functions in Seurat with Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Genes with > 0.25 log-fold changes, at least 25% expressed in tested groups, and Bonferroni-corrected p values < 0.05 were regarded as significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Cluster marker genes were identified by applying the DE tests for upregulated genes between cells in one cluster to all other clusters in the dataset. Top ranked genes (by log-fold changes) from each cluster of interest were extracted for further illustration. The exact number and definition of samples used in the analysis are specified in the legend of Figure 2 A and summarized in Table S1 .
Clusters were annotated based on a double-checking strategy: 1) by comparing cluster marker genes with public sources, and 2) by directly visualizing the expression pattern of CyTOF marker genes.
Significant DEGs between each monocyte cluster and the rest of monocyte subpopulations were identified by FindMarkers function from the Seurat package using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test statistics for genes expressed in at least 25% of all monocyte clusters. P values were corrected for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction and genes with corrected p values lower or equal 0.05 have been taken as significant DEGs for GO enrichment test by R package/ClusterProfiler v.3.10.1 ( Yu et al., 2012 134. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (4287) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To systematically compare the similarity of marker gene expression in the identified monocyte/neutrophils subpopulations between the two cohorts, the Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated based on the union of the top 50 marker genes of each cluster sorted by fold change in the two cohorts, based on their average expression of all cells in the specific subpopulation. The pairwise comparisons were performed, and the correlation coefficients were displayed using a heatmap.
The neutrophil space was investigated by subsetting the PBMC dataset to those clusters identified as neutrophils and immature neutrophils (cluster 5 and 6). Within those subsets, we selected top 2,000 variable genes and repeated the clustering using the SNN-graph based Louvain algorithm mentioned above with a resolution of 0.6. The dimensionality of the data was then reduced to 10 PCs, which served as input for the UMAP calculation. To categorize the observed neutrophil clusters into the respective cell cycle states, we applied the CellCycleScoring function of Seurat and visualized the results as pie charts.
A gene signature enrichment analysis using the ‘AUCell’ method ( Aibar et al., 2017 2. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ) was applied to link observed neutrophil clusters to existing studies and neutrophils of cohort 2. We set the threshold for the calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) to marker genes from collected publications and top 30 of the ranked maker genes from each of neutrophil clusters from cohort 2. The resulting AUC values were normalized the maximum possible AUC to 1 and subsequently visualized in violin plots or UMAP plots.
ScRNA-seq UMI count matrices were imported to R 3.6.2 and gene expression data analysis was performed using the R/Seurat package 3.1.2 ( Butler et al., 2018 15. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (1826) PubMed Google Scholar ). Demultiplexing of cells was performed using the HTODemux function implemented in Seurat. After identification of singlets, cells with more than 25% mitochondrial reads, less than 250 expressed genes or more than 5,000 expressed genes and less than 500 detected transcripts were excluded from the analysis and only those genes present in more than 5 cells were considered for downstream analysis. The following normalization, scaling and dimensionality reduction steps were performed independently for each of the data subsets used for the different analyses as indicated respectively. In general, gene expression values were normalized by total UMI counts per cell, multiplied by 10,000 (TP10K) and then log transformed by log10(TP10k+1). Subsequently, the data was scaled, centered and regressed against the number of detected transcripts per cell to correct for heterogeneity associated with differences in sequencing depth. For dimensionality reduction, PCA was performed on the top 2,000 variable genes identified using the vst method implemented in Seurat. Subsequently, UMAP was used for two-dimensional representation of the data structure. Cell type annotation was based on the respective clustering results combined with data-driven cell type classification algorithms based on reference transcriptome data ( Aran et al., 2019 5. Aran, D. ∙ Looney, A.P. ∙ Liu, L. ... Reference-based analysis of lung single-cell sequencing reveals a transitional profibrotic macrophage Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :163-172 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ) and expression of known marker genes.
ScRNA-seq count data of 229,731 cells derived from fresh and frozen PBMC samples purified by density gradient centrifugation and whole blood after erythrocyte lysis of cohort 2 (Bonn, BD Rhapsody) were combined, normalized and scaled as described above (see Figure S6 A). After variable gene selection and PCA, UMAP was performed based on the first 20 principal components (PCs). No batch correction or data integration strategies were applied to the data. Visualization of the cells ( Figure S6 A) showed overlay of cells of the same type (e.g., T cells clustered within the same cluster, irrespective of cell isolation procedure). In other words, cell type distribution was unaffected by the technical differences in sample handling. Data quality and information content was visualized as violin plots showing the number of detected genes, transcripts (UMIs) and genic reads per sample handling strategy split by PBMC and granulocyte fraction.
ScRNA-seq count data of 139,848 cells derived from fresh and frozen PBMC samples of cohort 2 (Bonn, BD Rhapsody) purified by density gradient centrifugation were normalized and scaled as described above. After variable gene selection and PCA, UMAP was performed and the cells were clustered using the Louvain algorithm based on the first 20 PCs and a resolution of 0.4. Cluster identities were determined by reference-based cell classification and inference of cluster-specific marker genes using the Wilcoxon rank sum test using the following cutoffs: genes have to be expressed in more than 20% of the cells of the respective cluster, exceed a logarithmic fold change cutoff to at least 0.2, and exhibited a difference of > 10% in the detection between two clusters. The exact number and definition of samples used in the analysis are specified in the legend of Figure 2 D and summarized in Table S1 .
To compare shifts in the monocyte and neutrophil populations in the PBMC compartment of COVID-19 patients, the percentages of the cellular subsets - as identified by clustering and cluster annotation explained above for the two independent scRNA-seq datasets (cohort 1 and cohort 2) - of the total number of PBMC in each dataset were quantified per sample and visualized together in boxplots. To determine the statistical significance of differences in cell proportions between the different conditions, a Dirichlet regression model was used, due to the fact that the proportions are not independent of one another. The R/R DirichletReg ( Maier, 2014 71. Maier, M.J. DirichletReg: Dirichlet Regression for Compositional Data in R https://epub.wu.ac.at/4077/ Date: 2014 Google Scholar ) package was used. The p values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
The monocyte space was investigated by subsetting the PBMC dataset to those clusters identified as monocytes (cluster 0-4), removing cells with strong multi-lineage marker expressions, and repeating the variable gene selection (top 2,000 variable genes), regression for the number of UMIs and scaling as described above. The dimensionality of the data was then reduced to 8 PCs, which served as input for the UMAP calculation. The SNN-graph based Louvain clustering of the monocytes was performed using a resolution of 0.2. Marker genes per cluster were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test using the following cutoffs: genes have to be expressed in > 20% of the cells, exceed a logarithmic fold change cutoff to at least 0.25, and exhibited a difference of > 10% in the detection between two clusters. The exact number and definition of samples used in the analysis are specified in the legend of Figure 4 A and summarized in Table S1 .
For each patient and time point of sample collection, the proportional occupancy of the monocyte clusters was calculated, and the relative proportions were subsequently visualized as a function of time.
ScRNA-seq count data derived from fresh PBMC samples purified by density gradient centrifugation and whole blood after erythrocyte lysis of cohort 2 (BD Rhapsody) were normalized, scaled, and regressed for the number of UMI per cell as described above. After PCA based on the top 2,000 variable genes, UMAP was performed using the first 30 PCs. Cell clusters were determined using Louvain clustering implemented in Seurat based on the first 30 principle components and a resolution of 0.8. Cluster identities were assigned as detailed above using reference-based classification and marker gene expression. Subsequently, the dataset was subsetted for whole blood samples after erythrocyte lysis and clusters identified as neutrophils and immature neutrophils, and re-scaled and regressed. After PCA on the top 2,000 variable genes, the neutrophil subset data was further processed using the data integration approach implemented in Seurat ( Stuart et al., 2019 116. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1102) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the first 30 PCs removing potential technical biases of separate experimental runs. UMAP and clustering were performed as described above on the top 12 PCs using a resolution of 0.3. Differentially expressed genes between clusters were defined using a Wilcoxon rank sum test for differential gene expression implemented in Seurat. Genes had to be expressed in > 10% of the cells of a cluster, exceed a logarithmic threshold > 0.1. The exact number and definition of samples used in the analysis are specified in the legend of Figure 7 A and summarized in Table S1 .
After cell type classification of the combined scRNA-seq dataset of fresh PBMC and whole blood samples of cohort 2 described above, 89,883 cells derived from whole blood samples after erythrocyte lysis were subsetted. Percentages of cell subsets in those whole blood samples of the total number of cells were quantified per sample and visualized in boxplots separated by disease stage and group.
For each cluster of neutrophils, the relative proportion across disease severity and time point was visualized as a fraction of samples from the respective condition contributing to the cluster.
Gene set enrichment was performed on gene sets from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database ( Kanehisa, 2019 49. Kanehisa, M. Toward understanding the origin and evolution of cellular organisms Protein Sci. 2019; 28 :1947-1951 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ), Hallmark gene sets ( Liberzon et al., 2015 64.

Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (4287) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To categorize the cells within the neutrophil clusters into the respective cell cycle states, we applied the CellCycleScoring function of Seurat and visualized the results as pie charts.
Trajectory analysis was performed using the destiny algorithm v3.0.1 ( Angerer et al., 2016 4. Angerer, P. ∙ Haghverdi, L. ∙ Büttner, M. ... destiny: diffusion maps for large-scale single-cell data in R Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :1241-1243 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the neutrophil space was subsetted to only severe patients (early and late) and only the most prominent clusters of the latter (clusters 1,2,6,8). The normalized data were scaled and regressed for UMIs and a diffusion map was calculated based on the top 2,000 variable genes with a sum of at least 10 counts over all cells. Based on the diffusion map, a diffusion pseudo time was calculated to infer a transition probability between the different cell states of the neutrophils. Subsequently, the density of the clusters along the pseudotime and marker gene expression for each cluster were visualized.
Enrichment of gene sets was performed using the ‘AUCell’ method ( Aibar et al., 2017 2. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in the package (version 1.4.1) in R. We set the threshold for the calculation of the AUC to the top 3% of the ranked genes and normalized the maximum possible AUC to 1. The resulting AUC values were subsequently visualized in violin plots or UMAP plots.
The Cytoscape (version v3.7.1, https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.1239303 ) plug-in iRegulon ( Janky et al., 2014 46. Janky, R. ∙ Verfaillie, A. ∙ Imrichová, H. ... iRegulon: from a gene list to a gene regulatory network using large motif and track collections PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10 e1003731 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 1.3) was used to predict the transcription factors potentially regulating cluster-specifically expressed gene sets in the neutrophil and monocyte subset analysis in cohort 2. The genomic regions for TF-motif search were limited to 10kb around the respective transcriptional start sites and filtered for predicted TFs with a normalized enrichment score > 4.0. Next, we filtered for TFs, which exceeded a cumulative normalized expression cutoff of 50 in the respective cluster. Subsequently, we selected transcription factors of known relevance in the context of neutrophil and monocyte biology and constructed a network linking target genes among the cluster-specifically expressed marker genes and their predicted and expressed regulators for visualization in Cytoscape.
Cytobank.org was used for de-barcoding of individual samples and manually gating of cell events to remove doublets, normalization beads and dead cells ( Kotecha et al., 2010 53. Kotecha, N. ∙ Krutzik, P.O. ∙ Irish, J.M. Web-based analysis and publication of flow cytometry experiments Curr. Protoc. Cytom. 2010; Chapter 10 :Unit10.17 PubMed Google Scholar ). Per channel intensity ranges were aligned between batches of measurements using a reference sample acquired across all batches and the BatchAdjust function to compute scaling factors at the 95th event percentiles ( Schuyler et al., 2019 111. Schuyler, R.P. ∙ Jackson, C. ∙ Garcia-Perez, J.E. ... Minimizing Batch Effects in Mass Cytometry Data Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :2367 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). For semi-automated gating of populations of interest, high-resolution SPADE clustering was conducted on all indicated asinh-transformed markers ( Table S2 ) with 400 target nodes ( Qiu et al., 2011 96. Qiu, P. ∙ Simonds, E.F. ∙ Bendall, S.C. ... Extracting a cellular hierarchy from high-dimensional cytometry data with SPADE Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :886-891 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individual SPADE nodes were then aggregated and annotated to cell subsets (bubbles) according to the expression of lineage-specific differentiation markers. Clustering results and FCS files were subsequently loaded into the R CytoML/flowCore environment (10.18129/B9.bioc.CytoML, 10.18129/B9.bioc.flowCore) for further downstream analyses. To generate UMAP representations all events of a given population of interest were down-sampled to 70,000 cells and then embedded using the tumap function (R uwot package, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/uwot/index.html ) parameterized by local neighborhood 50, learning rate 0.5, and using the indicated markers ( Table S2 ) as input dimensions. For statistical analysis of cell population abundances, we fitted a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) for each population using the lme4 package ( Nowicka et al., 2017 89. Nowicka, M. ∙ Krieg, C. ∙ Crowell, H.L. ... CyTOF workflow: differential discovery in high-throughput high-dimensional cytometry datasets F1000Res. 2017; 6 :748 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). P values resulting from differential abundance testing (via R multcomp and lsmeans packages) were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and an FDR-cutoff of 5% across all clusters/subsets and between-group comparisons ( Hothorn et al., 2008 42. Hothorn, T. ∙ Bretz, F. ∙ Westfall, P. Simultaneous inference in general parametric models Biom. J. 2008; 50 :346-363 Crossref Scopus (6063) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lenth, 2016 60. Lenth, R.V. Least-squares means: The R package lsmeans J. Stat. Softw. 2016; 69 :1-33 Crossref Scopus (2723) Google Scholar ). Additionally, indicated surface marker positive populations were exported from Cytobank and analyzed using prism 8. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparison test was used to compare differences in proportions between patient groups, whereas mixed-effect-analysis and Sidak’s multiple comparison test was applied to report time-dependent differences. The exact numbers and definitions of samples used in the analyses are specified in the respective figure legends and summarized in Table S1 .
Flow cytometry data analysis was performed with FlowJo V10.6.1. Cell type was defined as granulocytes (CD45 + , CD66b + ), non-classical monocytes (CD45 + , CD66b - , CD19 - , CD3 - , CD56 - , CD14 lo , CD16 + ). Relative cell percentage or mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was used for visualization and statistical analysis was done using unpaired t test.
In general, the R packages Seurat and the ggplot2 package (version 3.1.0) ( Wickham, 2016 128. Wickham, H. (2016). ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis. (Springer-Verlag, New York). Google Scholar ) were used to generate figures. For visualization of mass cytometry data, cluster minimum-spanning trees were rendered using Cytobank, the ComplexHeatmap package ( Gu et al., 2016 35. Gu, Z. ∙ Eils, R. ∙ Schlesner, M. Complex heatmaps reveal patterns and correlations in multidimensional genomic data Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :2847-2849 Crossref Scopus (1042) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to display subset phenotypes and GraphPad Prism to generate boxplots of quantitative data.
Part of the patients included in this study have been recruited within the clinical trial DRKS00021688, registered at the German registry for clinical studies ( Kurth et al., 2020 55. Kurth, F. ∙ Roennefarth, M. ∙ Thibeault, C. ... Studying the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019: a protocol for the Berlin prospective COVID-19 patient cohort (Pa-COVID-19) Infection. 2020; 48 :619-626 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to the deposition of the raw sequencing data on EGA, we provide an interactive platform for data inspection and analysis via FASTGenomics. The FASTGenomics platform ( fastgenomics.org ) provides processed count tables of the datasets generated in this study as well as key analytical results, such as UMAP coordinates and cluster identities, and the code written to analyze the respective data.
