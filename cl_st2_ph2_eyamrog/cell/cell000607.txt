Title: Counteracting chromatin effects of a splicing-correcting antisense oligonucleotide improves its therapeutic efficacy in spinal muscular atrophy


Abstract: Summary

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor-neuron disease caused by mutations of the SMN1 gene. The human paralog SMN2 , whose exon 7 (E7) is predominantly skipped, cannot compensate for the lack of SMN1 . Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that upregulates E7 inclusion and SMN protein levels by displacing the splicing repressors hnRNPA1/A2 from their target site in intron 7. We show that by promoting transcriptional elongation, the histone deacetylase inhibitor VPA cooperates with a nusinersen-like ASO to promote E7 inclusion. Surprisingly, the ASO promotes the deployment of the silencing histone mark H3K9me2 on the SMN2 gene, creating a roadblock to RNA polymerase II elongation that inhibits E7 inclusion. By removing the roadblock, VPA counteracts the chromatin effects of the ASO, resulting in higher E7 inclusion without large pleiotropic effects. Combined administration of the nusinersen-like ASO and VPA in SMA mice strongly synergizes SMN expression, growth, survival, and neuromuscular function.

Section: Introduction

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor-neuron disease caused by loss-of-function mutations of the SMN1 gene. Humans have a paralog, SMN2 , whose exon 7 (E7) is predominantly skipped, and so it cannot fully compensate for the lack of SMN1 . Both SMN2 and SMN1 are about 30-kbp long, but they differ in only 11 bp, which indicates a recent duplication in evolution. The only critical difference between the two SMN genes is the C>T base change 6 bp inside E7 that causes its skipping ( Lorson et al., 1999 35. Lorson, C.L. ∙ Hahnen, E. ∙ Androphy, E.J. ...

Genet. 2000; 9 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ), giving rise to a truncated and inactive version of the SMN protein. Both genes encode a splicing silencer sequence in intron 7 ( Singh et al., 2006 52. Singh, N.K. ∙ Singh, N.N. ∙ Androphy, E.J. ... Splicing of a critical exon of human survival motor neuron is regulated by a unique silencer element located in the last intron Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26 :1333-1346 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ) that is the target site for the negative splicing factors hnRNPA1 and A2 that contribute to E7 skipping in SMN2 . This basic mechanistic knowledge led to the development of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutic strategy for SMA: nusinersen (Spinraza) is a splicing-correcting ASO drug approved for clinical use. Nusinersen targets the splicing silencer located in SMN2 intron 7 pre-mRNA and, by blocking the binding of hnRNPA1 and A2, it promotes higher E7 inclusion, increasing SMN protein levels. Nusinersen was the first drug approved for SMA therapy and also the first splicing-corrective drug. Although nusinersen is administered to patients by lumbar puncture, to readily reach motor neurons, systemic administration robustly rescues severe symptoms in an SMA mouse model ( Hua et al., 2008 25.

Motor neuron cell-nonautonomous rescue of spinal muscular atrophy phenotypes in mild and severe transgenic mouse models Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :288-297 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ) which suggests that restoring adequate SMN levels in peripheral tissues could be therapeutically important.
Alternative splicing is not only regulated by the binding of activators and repressors to splicing enhancers and silencers but also by the rate of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional elongation and chromatin structure. According to the kinetic-coupling mechanism, slow elongation can promote either exon inclusion or skipping, depending on the type of exon ( de la Mata et al., 2003 11. de la Mata, M. ∙ Alonso, C.R. ∙ Kadener, S. ...

Pre-mRNA splicing is facilitated by an optimal RNA polymerase II elongation rate Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :2663-2676 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). In class I exons, slow elongation promotes inclusion by improving the recruitment of constitutive or regulatory splicing factors to the nascent mRNA, whereas in class II exons, slow elongation enhances the binding of inclusion-inhibitory factors to their target sites. Genome-wide studies showed that approximately 20% of a cell's alternative splicing events (ASEs) are sensitive to elongation and, depending on the cell type, class I exons represent between 50% and 80%, while class II exons are between 20% and 50% of the elongation-sensitive alternative exons ( Fong et al., 2014 18.

A slow transcription rate causes embryonic lethality and perturbs kinetic coupling of neuronal genes EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e101244 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, intragenic deployment of specific histone marks can create more compact or more relaxed chromatin regions that inhibit or promote RNAPII elongation, respectively, and consequently may affect alternative splicing. For example, acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9Ac) along gene bodies promotes skipping of class I exons ( Schor et al., 2009 51. Schor, I.E. ∙ Rascovan, N. ∙ Pelisch, F. ... Neuronal cell depolarization induces intragenic chromatin modifications affecting NCAM alternative splicing Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :4325-4330 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas dimethylation of the same residue (H3K9me2) promotes their inclusion ( Alló et al., 2009 1. Alló, M. ∙ Buggiano, V. ∙ Fededa, J.P. ... Control of alternative splicing through siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 :717-724 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schor et al., 2013 50. Schor, I.E. ∙ Fiszbein, A. ∙ Petrillo, E. ... Intragenic epigenetic changes modulate NCAM alternative splicing upon neuronal differentiation EMBO J. 2013; 32 :2264-2274 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, intragenic H3K9 acetylation promotes inclusion of class II exons, which is consistent with the fact that treatments that inhibit elongation promote their skipping ( Dujardin et al., 2014 13. Dujardin, G. ∙ Lafaille, C. ∙ de la Mata, M. ... How slow RNA polymerase II elongation favors alternative exon skipping Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :683-690 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We show here that SMN2 E7 is a class II alternative exon, which opened the way to explore the regulation of its inclusion using kinetic-coupling tools. We found that by promoting transcriptional elongation, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors cooperate with a nusinersen-like ASO to upregulate E7 inclusion. Surprisingly, the ASO also elicits the deployment of the silencing histone mark H3K9me2 on the SMN2 gene, creating a roadblock to RNAPII elongation that acts negatively on E7 inclusion. By removing the roadblock, HDAC inhibition counteracts the undesired chromatin effects of the ASO, resulting in higher E7 inclusion. Combined systemic administration of the nusinersen-like ASO and HDAC inhibitors in neonate SMA mice had strong synergistic effects on SMN expression, growth, survival, and neuromuscular function. Thus, we suggest that HDAC inhibitors have the potential to increase the clinical efficacy of nusinersen, and perhaps other splicing-modulatory ASO drugs, without large pleiotropic effects, as assessed by genome-wide transcriptomics and histone methylation analyses.

Section: Results

From a technical point of view, it should be noted that the SMN1 and SMN2 genes are present within a 500 kb duplicated region on Chromosome 5. Due to the extremely high sequence identity between them, reads of deep-sequence analyses and primers used to amplify segments in, for example, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) protocols (see below) cannot be assigned unequivocally to either SMN gene and so an assessment in parallel is imposed. The exceptions are the end-point RT-PCRs of (1) the transfected SMN2 minigene ( Lorson et al., 1999 35. Lorson, C.L. ∙ Hahnen, E. ∙ Androphy, E.J. ... A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :6307-6311 Crossref Scopus (1267) PubMed Google Scholar ), (2) the human SMN2 transgene in mice (see below), and (3) the human endogenous SMN2 gene. In the latter, exon 8 of SMN2 contains a DdeI restriction site that is absent in SMN1 . Hence, RT-PCR followed by restriction digestion with DdeI distinguishes SMN2 and SMN1 transcripts ( Parsons et al., 1996 45. Parsons, D.W. ∙ McAndrew, P.E. ∙ Monani, U.R. ... An 11 base pair duplication in Exon 6 of the SMN gene produces a Type I spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) phenotype: further evidence for SMN as the primary SMA-determining gene Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5 :1727-1732 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). We will refer to merged SMN1/2 genes when a parallel assessment is performed and as SMN2 alone when a gene-specific method is applied.
To evaluate the impact of elongation rate on SMN2 E7 inclusion, we assessed the effects of a slow mutant of RNAPII. We co-transfected HEK293T cells with an SMN2 E7 reporter minigene ( Lorson et al., 1999 35. Lorson, C.L. ∙ Hahnen, E. ∙ Androphy, E.J. ... A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :6307-6311 Crossref Scopus (1267) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a plasmid encoding an α-amanitin-resistant large subunit of RNAPII, with or without the point mutation R749H ( de la Mata et al., 2003 11. de la Mata, M. ∙ Alonso, C.R. ∙ Kadener, S. ... A slow RNA polymerase II affects alternative splicing in vivo Mol. Cell. 2003; 12 :525-532 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar ), previously shown to slow elongation in vivo by 2- to 3-fold ( Boireau et al., 2007 4. Boireau, S. ∙ Maiuri, P. ∙ Basyuk, E. ... The transcriptional cycle of HIV-1 in real-time and live cells J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179 :291-304 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maslon et al., 2019 39. Maslon, M.M. ∙ Braunschweig, U. ∙ Aitken, S. ... A slow transcription rate causes embryonic lethality and perturbs kinetic coupling of neuronal genes EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e101244 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). When transcription was carried out by the slow polymerase, SMN2 E7 skipping was greater than upon transcription by the α-amanitin-resistant wild-type polymerase ( Figure 1 A). The use of a minigene splicing reporter is necessary to assess the effects of the slow polymerase by transient co-transfections. However, and more importantly, the effect is also observed on E7 of the endogenous merged SMN1/2 genes, as shown by re-analysis of published genome-wide sequencing data ( Fong et al., 2014 18. Fong, N. ∙ Kim, H. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... Pre-mRNA splicing is facilitated by an optimal RNA polymerase II elongation rate Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :2663-2676 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ) which confirmed that not only the slow polymerase causes E7 skipping, but also that a fast mutant (E1126G) has the expected opposite effect, promoting E7 inclusion ( Figure 1 B). Consistently, treatment of cells with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), which indirectly inhibits elongation ( Listerman et al., 2006 34. Listerman, I. ∙ Sapra, A.K. ∙ Neugebauer, K.M. Cotranscriptional coupling of splicing factor recruitment and precursor messenger RNA splicing in mammalian cells Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13 :815-822 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dujardin et al., 2014 13. Dujardin, G. ∙ Lafaille, C. ∙ de la Mata, M. ... How slow RNA polymerase II elongation favors alternative exon skipping Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :683-690 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ), also promoted E7 skipping from the endogenous SMN2 gene ( Figure 1 C). These results indicate that SMN2 E7 is a class II exon.
In view of the above results, we reasoned that chromatin opening by histone acetylation should foster E7 inclusion by promoting RNAPII elongation. Therefore, we measured the effects of HDAC inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA), on E7 inclusion in HEK293T cells, either alone or in combination with transfection of a nusinersen-like 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (MOE) phosphorothioate-modified ASO (named ASO1 in this paper) at suboptimal concentrations. Nusinersen (5′-TCACTTTCATAATGCTGG-3′) was originally dubbed ASO10-27 ( Hua et al., 2008 25. Hua, Y. ∙ Vickers, T.A. ∙ Okunola, H.L. ... Antisense masking of an hnRNP A1/A2 intronic splicing silencer corrects SMN2 splicing in transgenic mice Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82 :834-848 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the equally effective ASO1 variant (5′-ATTCACTTTCATAATGCTGG-3′) has a 2-nt extension and can be described as ASO10-29. TSA alone was less potent than ASO1 in upregulating E7 inclusion, but combining both drugs greatly enhanced the effect ( Figure 2 A). The cooperative effect of TSA was dose-dependent ( Figure S1 A) and reproducible in other cell types, such as HeLa ( Figure S1 B) and SMA-patient fibroblasts ( Figure S1 C). We obtained similar results by combining ASO1 and other HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA (N-hydroxy-N′-phenyl-octanediamide) (not shown) and valproic acid (VPA, Figure 2 B). Also, similar effects were obtained with an ASO with the same sequence as ASO1 but with a different chemical backbone (2′-O-methyl phosphorothioate) (not shown).
H3K9me2 is a transcriptionally repressive mark that competes with the transcriptionally permissive H3K9Ac ( Ghare et al., 2014 20. Ghare, S.S. ∙ Joshi-Barve, S. ∙ Moghe, A. ... Coordinated histone H3 methylation and acetylation regulate physiologic and pathologic Fas ligand gene expression in human CD4+ T cells J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :412-421 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, with the caveat of potential indirect effects, inhibition of methylation by 5-aza cytidine (5-AZA), a drug that inhibits both DNA and histone methylation ( Wozniak et al., 2007 59. Wozniak, R.J. ∙ Klimecki, W.T. ∙ Lau, S.S. ... 5-Aza-20 -deoxycytidine-mediated reductions in G9A histone methyltransferase and histone H3 K9 di-methylation levels are linked to tumor suppressor gene reactivation Oncogene. 2007; 26 :77-90 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), enhanced the effects of ASO1 as effectively as the HDAC inhibitors ( Figure 2 C). Finally, in agreement with the fact that ASO1 displaces the splicing repressors hnRNPA1/A2 from their pre-mRNA target site in intron 7, we found that upon treatment with either TSA ( Figure 2 D) or VPA ( Figure 2 E), the effects of hnRNPA1/A2 depletion in promoting E7 inclusion were stronger.
VPA was previously assessed in the context of SMA, but not in combination with nusinersen ( Swoboda et al., 2010 55. Swoboda, K.J. ∙ Scott, C.B. ∙ Crawford, T.O. ... SMA CARNI-VAL trial part I: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of L-carnitine and valproic acid in spinal muscular atrophy PLoS One. 2010; 5 :e12140 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). ChIP analysis ( Figure 3 A) shows that VPA promoted intragenic H3K9 acetylation along the merged SMN1/2 genes, with a conspicuous peak around the E7 region, which may explain why E7 inclusion is upregulated, according to the kinetic-coupling mechanism of alternative splicing ( Kornblihtt et al., 2013 30. Kornblihtt, A.R. ∙ Schor, I.E. ∙ Alló, M. ... Alternative splicing: a pivotal step between eukaryotic transcription and translation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14 :153-165 Crossref Scopus (623) PubMed Google Scholar ). We ruled out the possibility that the HDAC inhibitors may be acting through modulation of SMN protein levels, which in turn might affect SMN2 E7 splicing ( Jodelka et al., 2010 27. Jodelka, F.M. ∙ Ebert, A.D. ∙ Duelli, D.M. ... A feedback loop regulates splicing of the spinal muscular atrophy-modifying gene, SMN2 Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19 :4906-4917 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), because overexpressing SMN did not alter the effect of ASO1 ( Figure S1 D)
Due to the fact that ASO1 is a single-stranded oligonucleotide that hybridizes with an intronic sequence at the pre-mRNA level, we wondered whether it could have chromatin effects similar to those of siRNAs directed to intronic regions, as previously described ( Alló et al., 2009 1. Alló, M. ∙ Buggiano, V. ∙ Fededa, J.P. ... Control of alternative splicing through siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 :717-724 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schor et al., 2013 50. Schor, I.E. ∙ Fiszbein, A. ∙ Petrillo, E. ... Intragenic epigenetic changes modulate NCAM alternative splicing upon neuronal differentiation EMBO J. 2013; 32 :2264-2274 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). These reports showed that siRNAs whose guide strands are complementary to pre-mRNA intronic sequences (antisense) located downstream of an alternative exon regulate the splicing of that exon by promoting silencing marks, such as H3K9me2, which in turn act as roadblocks to RNAPII elongation. This effect was shown to be counterbalanced by factors that favor chromatin opening or transcriptional elongation. Remarkably, here we observed that transfection of HEK293T cells with ASO1 promoted extensive H3K9 dimethylation along the merged SMN1/2 genes, with peaks that reached an 8-fold increase at the promoter and the alternative E7 areas ( Figure 3 B, cf. blue and gray lines). Other histone marks, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9Ac, were not affected by ASO1 transfection ( Figure S1 E). Most importantly, VPA not only reduced the H3K9me2 marks relative to the control ( Figure 3 B, cf. red and gray lines) but also completely abolished the effect of ASO1 ( Figure 3 B, cf. blue and purple lines), confirming the antagonistic roles of histone methylation and acetylation.
We next tested whether RNAPII densities were altered. Transfection with ASO1 greatly increased total, P-Ser5 and P-Ser2 ( Figures 3 C–3E) RNAPII densities at the promoter and at a distinct peak near the ASO1 target site on the transcript. In all three cases, the RNAPII peak was abolished when cells were additionally treated with VPA.
Overexpression of RNase H, an enzyme that degrades RNA in RNA-DNA hybrids, did not alter the effect of ASO1 on SMN2 E7 inclusion ( Figure S1 F). Moreover, the effect of ASO1 was unchanged by depletion of AGO1 ( Figure S1 G), known to be required for the chromatin effects of siRNA ( Alló et al., 2009 1. Alló, M. ∙ Buggiano, V. ∙ Fededa, J.P. ... Control of alternative splicing through siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 :717-724 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The above results suggest a model whereby, in the absence of HDAC inhibitors, ASO1 has two opposing effects on E7 inclusion ( Figure 4 A, left panel). It promotes inclusion by blocking hnRNPA1 and A2 binding to the pre-mRNA, but concomitantly results in a compact chromatin structure and a roadblock to elongation that in turn promotes E7 skipping. Although both effects co-exist, at high ASO1 concentrations, the chromatin effect is evidently surpassed by the hnRNPA1/A2 effect. On the other hand, in the presence of HDAC inhibitors (right panel), the chromatin-silencing effect is abrogated, and the levels of E7 inclusion increase further. To test the validity of this model, we investigated the effects of a second ASO, ASO2, whose target site is also located in intron 7 but downstream of the ASO1 target site ( Figure S2 A). ASO2 bears no sequence identity with ASO1 and does not overlap hnRNPA1/A2 binding sites. Even so, if ASO2 elicits the chromatin effect, it should inhibit E7 inclusion. Figure 4 B shows that, whereas ASO1 increases E7 inclusion, ASO2 inhibits it. Furthermore, similarly to ASO1, ASO2 promoted H3K9 methylation ( Figure 4 C) and higher total, P-Ser5 and P-Ser2 ( Figures 4 D–4F) RNAPII densities, consistent with roadblocks to elongation that in all cases were abolished by treatment with VPA. As specificity controls, neither ASO1 nor ASO2 promoted H3K9 dimethylation in a gene located in the same topologically associated domain (TAD) as SMN1 and SMN2 ( Lefebvre et al., 1995 32. Lefebvre, S. ∙ Bürglen, L. ∙ Reboullet, S. ... Identification and characterization of a spinal muscular atrophy-determining gene Cell. 1995; 80 :155-165 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3298) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 B), or in genes located outside the SMN1 and SMN2 TAD with either high ( Figure S2 C) or low ( Figure S2 D) basal levels of H3K9 methylation.
To confirm the mechanism proposed in Figure 4 A, we next tested cells with CRISPR-ablation of the gene encoding the histone H3K9 dimethyl transferase G9a ( Fiszbein et al., 2016 17. Fiszbein, A. ∙ Giono, L.E. ∙ Quaglino, A. ... Alternative splicing of G9a regulates neuronal differentiation Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :2797-2808 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The effectiveness of this gene knockout was confirmed by western blot ( Figure 5 A). Notably, this G9a knockout promoted the upregulation of SMN2 E7 inclusion by ASO1 ( Figure 5 B).
These results with ASO1 and ASO2 still leave open the question of whether the chromatin effects of these ASOs reflect a general phenomenon or a particular one restricted to the SMN gene, to its intron 7, or to introns in general. To this end, we assessed the effects of ASOs, directed at two other genes that were previously used in splicing experiments: the ELP ASOs were reported by the Krainer lab as controls to modulate E20 inclusion of the IKBKAP gene carrying a point mutation that causes familial dysautonomia ( Sinha et al., 2018 53. Sinha, R. ∙ Kim, Y.J. ∙ Nomakuchi, T. ... Antisense oligonucleotides correct the familial dysautonomia splicing defect in IKBKAP transgenic mice Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :4833-4844 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ); the FOXM1 ASOs were shown by the Valcárcel lab to promote skipping of E9 in the FOXM1 gene ( Martín et al., 2021 38. Martín, E. ∙ Vivori, C. ∙ Rogalska, M. ... Alternative splicing regulation of cell-cycle genes by SPF45/SR140/CHERP complex controls cell proliferation RNA. 2021; 27 :1557-1576 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, these ASOs, both unrelated in function, sequence, or chromosome location to the SMN1 or SMN2 genes, also enhance deployment of the H3K9me2 mark around their respective target sites. As relevant controls, ASO1 has no effect on either ELP1 or FOXM1 ( Figures 5 C and 5D).
We performed genome-wide characterization of the effects of ASO1 and VPA in HEK293T cells, including nascent-mRNA profiles, mRNA expression, and alternative splicing, using the recently developed polymerase intact nascent transcript (POINT)-seq technology ( Sousa-Luís et al., 2021 54. Sousa-Luís, R. ∙ Dujardin, G. ∙ Zukher, I. ... POINT technology illuminates the processing of polymerase-associated intact nascent transcripts Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 :1935-1950.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as more standard RNA-seq. Metagene analysis of POINT-seq on 2,741 expressed protein-coding genes confirmed that VPA markedly changed the pre-mRNA read-count ratio between the promoter region (P) and the gene body (GB) ( Figure 6 A), whereas ASO1 did not ( Figure 6 B). Similar results were obtained when assessing the number of genes with different P/GB values for control versus VPA- or ASO1-treated cells ( Figure 6 C).
RNA-seq analysis revealed only modest changes in gene expression and alternative splicing. Thus, only 69 genes out of 29,000 transcription units analyzed were significantly altered by VPA treatment ( Figure 6 D). Notably, none of the 29,000 transcription units significantly changed expression in response to ASO1 ( Figure 6 E), and the combined effects of VPA + ASO1 were also minimal (104 genes out of 29,000 transcription units, Figure 6 F).
Similarly, RNA-seq revealed that VPA only affected the patterns of 48 of the 79,549 ASEs analyzed (0.06%, Figures S3 A and S3B) when a relatively high threshold (Δpercentage spliced-in [PSI] > 30%) is applied, confirming the cooperative effects of ASO1 and VPA on the merged SMN1/2 genes’ E7 inclusion ( Figures S3 C and S3D). In conclusion, these data are consistent with a global increase in transcription elongation caused by VPA, as previously shown for individual genes, where elongation speed increased from ∼2 to ∼4 kb/min with the HDAC inhibitor TSA ( Dujardin et al., 2014 13. Dujardin, G. ∙ Lafaille, C. ∙ de la Mata, M. ... How slow RNA polymerase II elongation favors alternative exon skipping Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :683-690 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ) but with no conspicuous global changes in gene expression and alternative splicing, under the conditions used here. In parallel, transfection with ASO1 had no global effects on elongation or gene expression.
The recently designed POINT-seq method assesses the distribution of nascent mRNA reads associated to elongating RNAPII along transcribed genes. As mentioned above, it becomes impossible to assign POINT-seq reads individually to each of the two genes. For these reasons, POINT-seq analysis must necessarily refer to the merged SMN1/2 genes. In spite of these limitations, POINT-seq data showed that, unlike ASO1, VPA reduced the ratio of read counts at the promoter over the gene body (P/GB ratio) from 4.17 to 1.73 ( Figure S3 E), consistent with the global effect of VPA on elongation. However, when focusing on the region around ASO1’s target site ( Figure S3 F), we clearly observe that ASO1 increases the ratio of reads mapping upstream versus downstream of the target site (U/D ratio), which is highly consistent with the roadblock to elongation evidenced by RNAPII ChIP ( Figure 3 ).
To assess whether the increase in elongation by VPA is accompanied by an increase in overall transcription of the merged SMN1/2 genes, we selected three genes from the RNA-seq data of Figure 6 D—one whose expression is augmented by VPA ( PAK5 ), another whose expression is unaffected by VPA ( PLCB4 ), and the merged SMN1/2 genes—and compared their POINT-seq transcription profiles with and without VPA. Similar to PLCB4 , and unlike PAK5 , POINT-seq profiles of the merged SMN1/2 genes indicate that its transcription is unaltered by VPA ( Figures 6 G and 6H).
The increase in H3K9 dimethylation of the merged SMN1/2 genes caused by ASO1, shown by ChIP-qPCR ( Figure 4 C), was confirmed by ChIP-seq analysis ( Figure S4 ). ASO1 caused a nearly 10-fold increase in the H3K9me2 signal around its target site, compared with a 2-fold increase in the rest of the gene (regions B and A, respectively, in Figures S4 A and S4B). Consistent with the above results ( Figure 4 C), ASO1’s effect was abolished by VPA. As a negative control, neither ASO1 nor VPA affected the deployment of the H3K9me2 mark in the β-actin gene ( Figure S4 C).
Nusinersen, administered subcutaneously in newborn SMA mice, distributes broadly and strongly rescues survival and motor function ( Hua et al., 2011 24. Hua, Y. ∙ Sahashi, K. ∙ Rigo, F. ... Peripheral SMN restoration is essential for long-term rescue of a severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse model Nature. 2011; 478 :123-126 Crossref Scopus (584) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore sought to test the combined effect of ASO1 and VPA treatment using a mouse model of severe SMA. Mice have only one Smn gene, and Smn − / − mutants are embryonic lethal ( Hsie-Li et al., 2000 22. Hsieh-Li, H.M. ∙ Chang, J.G. ∙ Jong, Y.J. ... A mouse model for spinal muscular atrophy Nat. Genet. 2000; 24 :66-70 Crossref Scopus (618) PubMed Google Scholar ; Monani et al., 2000 40. Monani, U.R. ∙ Sendtner, M. ∙ Coovert, D.D. ... The human centromeric survival motor neuron gene (SMN2) rescues embryonic lethality in Smn(-/-) mice and results in a mouse with spinal muscular atrophy Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used Smn -null transgenic mice containing two copies of the human SMN2 transgene, which develops a severe SMA-like phenotype with a mean survival of ∼7–10 days ( Hua et al., 2011 24. Hua, Y. ∙ Sahashi, K. ∙ Rigo, F. ... Peripheral SMN restoration is essential for long-term rescue of a severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse model Nature. 2011; 478 :123-126 Crossref Scopus (584) PubMed Google Scholar ). We administered two consecutive low-dose subcutaneous injections of ASO1 (18 μg/g) at P0 and P1 and/or one subcutaneous injection of VPA (10 μg/g) at P1. The rationale for the choice of a low or suboptimal dose of ASO1 is to elicit a partial phenotypic effect that allows us to evaluate improvements by co-administration of HDAC inhibitors. Because the generation of mice with the two mouse SMN alleles disrupted is performed by the crossing of Smn +/− heterozygous and the Smn −/− (SMA mice), and Smn −/+ phenotypes are not distinguished at birth, injections were blind with respect to the genotypes and genotyping was performed after the injections. Figure 7 A shows that SMA mice injected with VPA alone died before P10, similarly to vehicle-treated controls. The suboptimal dose of ASO1 alone extended median survival to ∼20 days, while co-injection of VPA with ASO1 increased the median survival to ∼70 days. All mice injected with ASO1 alone were dead at P62, whereas ∼60% of those treated with ASO1 and VPA were still alive at P62. The difference between the two treatments is statistically significant (p = 0.00081).
Body weight gain in the surviving mice was also greatly improved by VPA plus ASO1 injections, compared with ASO1 alone ( Figure 7 B). We obtained similar results with a combined treatment of ASO1 and TSA ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Western blot analysis shows that the combined treatment greatly increased the levels of human SMN protein in liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, brain, and heart of the treated mice ( Figures S5 C–S5H). The largest effect on SMN expression was in the liver ( Figure S5 C), underscoring the proposed role of this organ in SMA pathogenesis ( Hua et al., 2011 24. Hua, Y. ∙ Sahashi, K. ∙ Rigo, F. ... Peripheral SMN restoration is essential for long-term rescue of a severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse model Nature. 2011; 478 :123-126 Crossref Scopus (584) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Figure S6 illustrates conspicuous differences in size, posture, eye-appearance, and grooming between the mice treated with ASO1 alone and those treated with ASO1+TSA at 11, 14, 17, and 42 days after birth. Both the untreated and TSA-only-treated mice died around P7–P8.
We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of the combined treatment versus a single drug treatment or no treatment at all. An HR greater than 1 suggests an increased risk, and an HR below 1 suggests a smaller risk. We obtained an HR = 0.19 for the combined treatment with VPA + ASO1 versus ASO1 alone, and an HR = 0.12 for the combined treatment with TSA + ASO1 versus ASO1 alone. Thus, far from being risky, these data demonstrate that the combined treatments are highly beneficial.
In addition, we performed two noninvasive neuromuscular function tests appropriate for mouse pups. In the righting-reflex test ( Feather-Schussler and Ferguson, 2016 16. Feather-Schussler, D.N. ∙ Ferguson, T.S. A battery of motor tests in a neonatal mouse model of cerebral palsy J. Vis. Exp. 2016; 117 :e53569 Google Scholar ), whereas wild-type mice righted immediately, untreated mutant mice took ∼45 s. This delay was not significantly changed by VPA treatment, was greatly reduced by ASO1 treatment (∼10 s), and was virtually eliminated by the combined treatment ( Figure 7 C; Video S1 ). In the grip-strength test, animals treated with both ASO1 and VPA could hold on at much higher inclination angles (∼70°), compared with the untreated mutants (∼35°), mice treated with VPA alone (∼30°), or limiting ASO1 alone (∼45°) ( Figure 7 D; Video S2 ).

As in cultured cells ( Figure 3 ), ASO1 injection into SMA mice also promoted higher H3K9 dimethylation and RNAPII accumulation on the SMN2 transgene in liver and brain ( Figure S7 ). This result strongly suggests that the mechanism we elucidated in cultured cells also underlies the survival and behavioral effects observed in mice.

Section: Discussion

This study shows that SMN2 E7 is a class II alternative exon, whose inclusion into the mature mRNA is inhibited by a slow mutant of RNAPII and increased by a fast mutant. Consistently, by promoting transcriptional elongation, HDAC inhibitors cooperate with the nusinersen-like ASO ASO1 to enhance SMN2 E7 inclusion. These effects were not only observed in human cells in culture, including SMA-patient fibroblasts, but also in a transgenic mouse model of SMA in which the combined administration of ASO1 and HDAC inhibitors improved growth, survival, and neuromuscular function, compared with either drug alone. Among HDAC inhibitors, unlike TSA and SAHA, VPA is approved for clinical use ( Wirth et al., 2006 58. Wirth, B. ∙ Brichta, L. ∙ Hahnen, E. Spinal muscular atrophy: from gene to therapy Semin. Pediatr. Neurol. 2006; 13 :121-131 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) and has been previously used, without any ASO, in clinical trials that failed to demonstrate efficacy ( Swoboda et al., 2010 55. Swoboda, K.J. ∙ Scott, C.B. ∙ Crawford, T.O. ... SMA CARNI-VAL trial part I: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of L-carnitine and valproic acid in spinal muscular atrophy PLoS One. 2010; 5 :e12140 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kissel et al., 2011 29. Kissel, J.T. ∙ Scott, C.B. ∙ Reyna, S.P. ... Project cure spinal muscular atrophy investigators' network. SMA CARNI-VAL trial part II: a prospective, single-armed trial of L-carnitine and valproic acid in ambulatory children with spinal muscular atrophy PLoS One. 2011; 6 :e21296 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rationale for VPA’s clinical testing was that chromatin opening at the SMN2 promoter would increase transcription and therefore SMN levels ( Kernochan et al., 2005 28. Kernochan, L.E. ∙ Russo, M.L. ∙ Woodling, N.S. ... The role of histone acetylation in SMN gene expression Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14 :1171-1182 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our experiments, VPA increases elongation ( Figure 6 A) but not overall transcription ( Figures 6 G and 6H) of the SMN gene. It has been previously shown ( Schor et al., 2009 51. Schor, I.E. ∙ Rascovan, N. ∙ Pelisch, F. ... Neuronal cell depolarization induces intragenic chromatin modifications affecting NCAM alternative splicing Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :4325-4330 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ) that an increase in intragenic elongation does not necessarily imply an increase in gene transcription and therefore in total mRNA levels. This is because such treatment may not further increase the recruitment of RNAPII to the promoter. Thus, changes in elongation rates may affect the quality (splicing isoform ratio) but not the quantity of the encoded mRNA. Results in cells coincide with a lack of corrective effect of VPA alone in our SMA mouse experiments ( Figure 7 ; Figure S5 ). In particular, administration of VPA alone did not stimulate the production of SMN protein tested by western blot in six different organs of the treated mice, but strongly stimulated ASO1’s effect ( Figures S5 C–S5H). It should be mentioned that our mouse experiments involved a single dose of HDAC inhibitors alone or together with ASO1 at postnatal days 1 or 2, whereas HDAC inhibitors alone have shown slight beneficial effects in mice when dosed chronically ( Avila et al., 2007 2. Avila, A.M. ∙ Burnett, B.G. ∙ Taye, A.A. ... Trichostatin A increases SMN expression and survival in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117 :659-671 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chang et al., 2001 8. Chang, J.G. ∙ Hsieh-Li, H.M. ∙ Jong, Y.J. ... Treatment of spinal muscular atrophy by sodium butyrate Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :9808-9813 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recently, an additive effect on E7 inclusion of the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 and a nusinersen-like phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) was reported for SMA-patient-derived fibroblasts and transgenic mouse neural stem cells ( Pagliarini et al., 2020 44. Pagliarini, V. ∙ Guerra, M. ∙ Di Rosa, V. ... Combined treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 and a splice-switch antisense oligonucleotide enhances SMN2 splicing and SMN expression in Spinal Muscular Atrophy cells J. Neurochem. 2020; 153 :264-275 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the combination of VPA with a splice-switching PMO conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide was shown to promote more E7 inclusion in patient fibroblasts than either agent alone ( Farrelly-Rosch et al., 2017 15. Farrelly-Rosch, A. ∙ Lau, C.L. ∙ Patil, N. ... Combination of valproic acid and morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide produces improved outcomes in spinal muscular atrophy patient-derived fibroblasts Neurochem. Int. 2017; 108 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, neither study explored the underlying mechanism nor tested animal models.
Our mechanistic analysis in this paper reveals that the nusinersen-like ASO promotes the deployment of the silencing histone mark H3K9me2 on the SMN2 gene, especially around its target site, similarly to reported nuclear effects of siRNAs that target pre-mRNA sequences, creating a roadblock to RNAPII elongation that affects alternative splicing ( Alló et al., 2009 1. Alló, M. ∙ Buggiano, V. ∙ Fededa, J.P. ... Control of alternative splicing through siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 :717-724 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schor et al., 2013 50. Schor, I.E. ∙ Fiszbein, A. ∙ Petrillo, E. ... Intragenic epigenetic changes modulate NCAM alternative splicing upon neuronal differentiation EMBO J. 2013; 32 :2264-2274 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that both the increase in H3K9 dimethylation and the accumulation of RNAPII at ASO1's target region are abrogated by HDAC inhibitors. ASO1 triggers accumulation of total RNAPII and its two main phosphoisoforms, suggesting that it acts as a general steric impediment rather than regulating RNAPII phosphorylation. The chromatin effect of ASO1 does not appear to involve R-loop formation ( Tang-Wong et al., 2019 56. Tan-Wong, S.M. ∙ Dhir, S. ∙ Proudfoot, N.J. R-loops promote antisense transcription across the mammalian genome Mol. Cell. 2019; 76 :600-616.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), because the effect of ASO1 is not altered by overexpression of RNase H, an enzyme that degrades RNA in RNA-DNA hybrids ( Figure S1 F). This suggests that ASO1 does not act through hybridization to DNA, as opposed to RNA, consistent with the previous demonstration that an oligonucleotide with a complementary sequence to nusinersen (sense oligo) has no effect on SMN2 E7 inclusion ( Rigo et al., 2014 48. Rigo, F. ∙ Chun, S.J. ∙ Norris, D.A. ... Pharmacology of a central nervous system delivered 2′-O-methoxyethyl-modified survival of motor neuron splicing oligonucleotide in mice and nonhuman Primates J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2014; 350 :46-55 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ).
These findings reveal unforeseen alterations to the deployment of histone marks induced by ASO treatment at the targeted gene. Most importantly, we show that the chromatin effects of the ASOs are sequence-specific, not restricted to intronic regions or to the merged SMN1/2 genes ( Figures 5 C and 5D) and, therefore, potentially able to affect, either positively or negatively, other ASO-based therapies. In particular, the uncoupling experiments with SMN2 ASO2 ( Figures 4 B–4F) confirm the model of Figure 4 A in which the nusinersen ASO1 has two opposite effects on SMN2 E7 inclusion: a positive one, through displacement of the negative splicing factors hnRNP A1/A2; and a negative one, through triggering the deployment of the H3K9me2 mark. In this context, promotion of histone acetylation mitigates the negative effect at suboptimal ASO1 concentrations.
We support the idea that co-transcriptional base pairing of ASOs with their target sites on pre-mRNAs promotes local recruitment of histone methylating enzymes. However, further investigation will be necessary to decipher in depth the precise mechanism by which ASOs trigger H3K9 dimethylation.
Genome-wide analyses reinforce the evidence that the combined treatment with ASO1 and HDAC inhibitors enhances SMN2 E7 inclusion, accompanied by only marginal alterations—both in the number of genes affected and in the magnitude of the change—of global gene expression and alternative splicing ( Figure 6 ; Figure S3 ).
Our results pave the way toward clinical assessments in patients. Although we expected VPA to have large pleiotropic effects, our RNA-seq data of cells in culture indicated that, in our conditions, global effects on gene expression and splicing were minimal, which is consistent with our results in mice and with the fact that VPA is currently used to treat several neurological disorders ( Chen et al., 2014 9. Chen, S. ∙ Wu, H. ∙ Klebe, D. ... Valproic acid: a new candidate of therapeutic application for the acute central nervous system injuries Neurochem. Res. 2014; 39 :1621-1633 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). In any case, the drug concentrations and short times of VPA treatment we employed were sufficient to enhance the effect of ASO1 on splicing, without major alterations to gene expression. In fact, comparable ( Balasubramanian et al., 2019 3. Balasubramanian, D. ∙ Pearson, J.F. ∙ Kennedy, M.A. Gene expression effects of lithium and valproic acid in a serotonergic cell line Physiol. Genomics. 2019; 51 :43-50 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) RNA-seq results were obtained in other studies, under similar VPA-treatment conditions. For example, Balasubramanian et al. (2019) 3. Balasubramanian, D. ∙ Pearson, J.F. ∙ Kennedy, M.A. Gene expression effects of lithium and valproic acid in a serotonergic cell line Physiol. Genomics. 2019; 51 :43-50 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar reported that treatment of RN46A cells with 0.5 mM VPA for 72 h caused regulation of only 88 of the ∼16,500 genes analyzed. However, treatment of rats with VPA doses 60 times higher than the ones we used in mice here (see below) changed expression of about 3,000 genes ( Zhang et al., 2018 60. Zhang, R. ∙ Zhou, J. ∙ Ren, J. ... Transcriptional and splicing dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex in valproic acid rat model of autism Reprod. Toxicol. 2018; 53-61 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). This implies a concentration-dependent effect on gene-regulation.
Compared with other HDAC inhibitors, VPA may be a good choice, because it was reported that at molar concentrations 1,000-fold lower than VPA, other HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA elicit expression changes in 10 times more genes than VPA, strongly affecting many signaling pathways ( Lunke et al., 2021 37. Lunke, S. ∙ Maxwell, S. ∙ Khurana, I. ... Epigenetic evidence of an Ac/Dc axis by VPA and SAHA Clin. Epigenetics. 2021; 13 :58 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, although VPA has limited efficacy at best in SMA patients, it is safe and well tolerated ( Elshafay et al., 2019 14. Elshafay, A. ∙ Hieu, T.H. ∙ Doheim, M.F. ... Efficacy and safety of valproic acid for spinal muscular atrophy: a systematic review and meta-analysis CNS Drugs. 2019; 33 :239-250 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lack of an effect per se in SMA mice ( Figures 7 A and 7B), contrasting with the strong effect in improving ASO1’s therapeutic effects, suggests that an optimal VPA dose can be established that minimizes potential toxicities in patients. We speculate that systemic VPA administration will improve the efficacy of nusinersen, particularly in peripheral tissue. SMN is a ubiquitously expressed protein playing fundamental roles in the splicing of all tissues. However, currently nusinersen is only administered via intrathecal injection to mainly reach the central nervous system. We foresee that, at low concentrations of nusinersen present in peripheral tissues due to cerebrospinal fluid clearance after intrathecal injection ( Chiriboga et al., 2016 10. Chiriboga, C.A. ∙ Swoboda, K.J. ∙ Darras, B.T. ... Results from a phase 1 study of nusinersen (ISIS-SMN(Rx)) in children with spinal muscular atrophy Neurology. 2016; 86 :890-897 Crossref Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ), the combined systemic treatment with VPA or other HDAC inhibitors may increase SMN levels in the periphery, as shown in Figures S5 C–S5H, and improve nusinersen performance in peripheral tissue.
Finally, we would like to underscore that our results support the relevance of the kinetic coupling between pre-mRNA processing and transcriptional elongation in a whole organism. Except for the alternative splicing/elongation response to light and dark in whole Arabidopsis plants ( Godoy Herz et al., 2019 21. Godoy Herz, M.A. ∙ Kubaczka, M.G. ∙ Brzyżek, G. ... Light regulates plant alternative splicing through the control of transcriptional elongation Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :1066-1074.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) and non-physiological intervention with the slow polymerase mutant in mice ( Maslon et al., 2019 39. Maslon, M.M. ∙ Braunschweig, U. ∙ Aitken, S. ... A slow transcription rate causes embryonic lethality and perturbs kinetic coupling of neuronal genes EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e101244 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), most research supporting kinetic coupling was previously performed in cultured cells.
In our view, the main limitation of this proof-of-principle study is that we tested only one dosing protocol for the combined administration of the nusinersen-like ASO1 and HDAC inhibitors in SMA mice. This protocol involved a single subcutaneous injection of the drugs at P0/P1, alone or in combination, which proved to be effective in demonstrating the advantages of combined treatment on growth, survival, and motor function. The blood-brain barrier is immature at this stage, so ASOs do reach the CNS and very effectively rescue the motor-neuron defects, with a long duration of action ( Hua et al., 2011 24. Hua, Y. ∙ Sahashi, K. ∙ Rigo, F. ... Peripheral SMN restoration is essential for long-term rescue of a severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse model Nature. 2011; 478 :123-126 Crossref Scopus (584) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 23. Hua, Y. ∙ Liu, Y.H. ∙ Sahashi, K. ... Motor neuron cell-nonautonomous rescue of spinal muscular atrophy phenotypes in mild and severe transgenic mouse models Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :288-297 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, since nusinersen is administered directly to CSF (intrathecally) in patients, additional studies will be necessary to adjust the effects of intrathecal administration of nusinersen combined with systemic administration of VPA, including the demonstration that nusinersen not only increases H3K9me2 levels in whole tissues ( Figure S7 ) but also that VPA reduces these levels.

All mouse protocols were in accordance with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. The severe SMA model ( Smn -/- ; SMN2 2TG/0 ) was generated as previously described ( Riessland et al., 2010 47. Riessland, M. ∙ Ackermann, B. ∙ Förster, A. ... SAHA ameliorates the SMA phenotype in two mouse models for spinal muscular atrophy Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19 :1492-1506 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). Animals were housed in groups and fed standard chow diets. Mice of the same age and of both sexes were used for the studies. Weights were monitored on a daily basis, and animals were sacrificed at day 7 and tissues were harvested.
For each animal, the genotype was verified by PCR reactions using tail-tip DNA. Primer sequences and PCR conditions were previously described ( Rigo et al., 2014 48. Rigo, F. ∙ Chun, S.J. ∙ Norris, D.A. ... Pharmacology of a central nervous system delivered 2′-O-methoxyethyl-modified survival of motor neuron splicing oligonucleotide in mice and nonhuman Primates J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2014; 350 :46-55 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Oligonucleotide solutions in saline were injected subcutaneously into the upper back at P0 and P1 with a 5-mL syringe and 33-gauge custom removable needle (Hamilton) as described ( Hua et al., 2011 24. Hua, Y. ∙ Sahashi, K. ∙ Rigo, F. ... Peripheral SMN restoration is essential for long-term rescue of a severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse model Nature. 2011; 478 :123-126 Crossref Scopus (584) PubMed Google Scholar ). All drugs were injected subcutaneously before P3, contralateral to the oligonucleotide-injection site, with TSA (10 mg/kg) or VPA (10 mg/kg) or vehicle. Mouse tissues and organs, including liver, thigh muscles, kidney, and spinal cord, were snap-frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at −70 °C.
Power calculations were done according to standard requirements for animal-protocol approval by CSHL IACUC. Based on anticipated effect sizes, we aimed to have 12-15 pups per group for the survival analysis. Because the crosses to obtain SMA mice yield ∼50% of non-SMA heterozygote mice, we needed a total of 120 pups to obtain ∼60 SMA mice (15 pups x 4 treatments) for each HDAC inhibitor treatment with its own controls. To obtain this number of mice, a total of 60 breeding cages were used.
The number of 12-15 pups per group was decided following the conditions of a Hua et al. (2011) 24. Hua, Y. ∙ Sahashi, K. ∙ Rigo, F. ... Peripheral SMN restoration is essential for long-term rescue of a severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse model Nature. 2011; 478 :123-126 Crossref Scopus (584) PubMed Google Scholar . This number was chosen in order to test the effect of VPA/TSA on ASO1 therapy with inferential statistics (i.e., using p-values) and at the same time to avoid sacrificing an excessive number of mice, according to https://research.usu.edu//irb/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/08/A_Researchers_Guide_to_Power_Analysis_USU.pdf and to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011).
ASO1 (5′-ATTCACTTTCATAATGCTGG-3′), a seven-mismatch control (5′-AATCATTTGCTTCATACAGG-3′) and ASO2 (5′-AAAGTATGTTTCTTCCACAC-3′) 2′- O -methoxyethyl-modified oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate backbone and all 5-methyl cytosines were purchased from IDT, and a 2′-OMe-modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (5′-AUUCACUUUCAUAAUGCUGG-3′) ( Hua et al., 2008 25. Hua, Y. ∙ Vickers, T.A. ∙ Okunola, H.L. ... Antisense masking of an hnRNP A1/A2 intronic splicing silencer corrects SMN2 splicing in transgenic mice Am. J. Hum.

The expression vectors for α-amanitin-resistant variants of the large subunit of human RNAPII (Rpb1) wild-type (WTres; pAT7Rpb1αAmr vector), and the hC4 mutant (pAT7Rpb1αAmrR749H) were previously described 4 . An α-amanitin-sensitive Rpb1 expression vector (WTs) was used as a control. The pCI-SMN2 (Addgene, Plasmid #72287) minigene vector for SMN2 was described previously ( Lorson et al., 1999 35. Lorson, C.L. ∙ Hahnen, E. ∙ Androphy, E.J. ... A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :6307-6311 Crossref Scopus (1267) PubMed Google Scholar ).
HEK293T, HeLa, and SMA type I homozygous and carrier fibroblasts 3813 and 3814 (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, New Jersey, United States) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g of glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37 °C. Cells were plated at a density of 2×10 5 cells per well in 12-well plates 24 hr before transfection. siRNA (25 nM), plasmid (500 ng), or ASO (25 nM) transfections were performed 24 hr after cells were plated, using 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per well in 12-well plates. 24-48 h later, cells were treated with Trichostatin A (Sigma, T8552), Valproic Acid (Sigma, P4543), 5-Azacytidine (Sigma, A2385) or vehicle for the indicated time, and harvested for downstream procedures.
Twenty milligrams of mouse tissue was pulverized in liquid N 2 with mortar and pestle, and homogenized with 1 mL of Trizol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's directions. Two methods were used for RT-PCR reactions in different experiments: 1. One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT primer, and the cDNA was amplified. Amplification and analysis of SMN2 transcripts was performed as described ( Lorson et al., 1999 35. Lorson, C.L. ∙ Hahnen, E. ∙ Androphy, E.J. ... A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :6307-6311 Crossref Scopus (1267) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2. One microgram of total RNA was reversed transcribed using Superscript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific) reverse transcriptase and random primers. After PCR amplification using Gotaq (Promega) and SMN2 primers surrounding E7, products were either loaded in a 6% acrylamide (37.5:1) TBE gel and stained with Ethidium Bromide for visualization or analysed by Tapestation 4150 using high sensitivity DNA D1000 screentapes (Agilent) for quantification. Primer sequences are listed in the Table S1 . Data were analyzed using Excel and plotted in GraphPad Prism. A minimum of three biological replicates were always analyzed, each in technical triplicate. Samples form each RT-PCR experiment were run together on the same gel. Non-consecutive lanes were denoted by a vertical white line of separation.
Twenty milligrams of tissue was pulverized in liquid N 2 and homogenized in 0.4 mL (liver, kidney, muscle, spinal cord, brain, and heart) of 1× protein sample buffer containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 0.1 M DTT. Protein samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with mAb anti-hSMN (BD Biosciences, 610646), or pAb anti-β-tubulin (Sigma), followed by secondary IRDye 800CW-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody. Protein signals were detected with an Odyssey instrument (LI-COR Biosciences).
Cells were lysed in 1X protein sample buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0025% Bromophenol blue). Protein samples were separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE (NuPage, Life Technologies) and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. The blots were probed with anti-H3K9me2 (Abcam, ab1220), anti-H3K9ac (Abcam, ab4441), anti-H3 (Abcam, ab12079), anti-Myc (Millipore, MABE282), anti-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T5168), anti-RNase H1 (Proteintech, 15606-1-AP), anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A2066), anti-G9A (CST, 3306S) or anti-Ago1 (CST, 5053S) antibodies.
Downregulation of hnRNP A1 and A2 was performed using ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon). siRNA oligos were delivered to cells following the manufacturer’s instructions, and allowed to act for 72 hr. Accell siRNA anti-human non targeting siRNA (Dharmacon, NC1567415) was used as a control.
siRNA oligos were delivered to cells following the manufacturer’s instructions, and allowed to act for 72 hr. siLuc (Sense: GAUUAUGUCCGGUUAUGUAUU Antisense: UACAUAACCGGACAUAAUCUU) was used as a control.
Approximately 2 × 10 6 HEK293T cells per sample were treated for 10 min in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde at room temperature to crosslink protein-DNA complexes. Crosslinking was stopped with glycine at a final concentration of 125 mM. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and swelled on ice for 10 min in 25 mM HEPES pH 8, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail set III (Calbiochem). Following Dounce homogenization, the nuclei were collected and resuspended in 1 ml sonication buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail). DNA was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Bioruptor Diagenode) to an average length of 200–500 bp. After addition of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, samples were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated O/N with 40 μl of pre-coated anti-IgG magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G, Invitrogen) previously incubated with the antibody of interest for 6 hr at 4 ºC. The antibodies used were: rabbit anti-H3 (2 μg, Abcam ab1791), mouse anti-H3K9me2 (4 μg, Abcam ab1220), rabbit anti H3K9me3 (4 μg, Abcam ab8898), rabbit anti H3K9Ac (2 μg, Abcam ab4441), rabbit anti Rpb1 NTD (2 μg, Cell Signaling, D8L4Y), rabbit Phospho-Rpb1 CTD Ser2 (2 μg, Cell Signaling, E1Z3G), rabbit Phospho-Rpb1 CTD Ser5 (2 μg, Cell Signaling, D9N5I). Control immunoprecipitations were performed with rabbit IgG (1 μg, Abcam ab171870). Beads were washed sequentially for 5 min each in Low-salt (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), High-Salt (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) and LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Na-deoxycholate) for 5 min at 4 ºC and then twice in TE 1× for 2 min at room temperature. Beads were eluted in 1% SDS and 100 mM NaHCO 3 buffer for 15 min at 65 ºC and crosslinking was reversed for 6 hr after addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mM. Chromatin was precipitated with ethanol overnight, treated with 20 μg proteinase K, and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. Immunoprecipitated DNA (1.5 μl) and serial dilutions of the 10% input DNA (1:4, 1:20, 1:100, and 1:500) were analyzed by SYBR-Green real-time qPCR. The oligonucleotide sequences used are listed in Table S1 .
HEK293T or S2 cells were treated for 10 min in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde at room temperature to crosslink protein-DNA complexes, and the crosslinking was then quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 600 μL of Cell Lysis Buffer (5 mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40 and 1x complete) and incubated on ice for 10 min. They were then centrifuged at 2,400 rpm for 5 min and nuclear pellets were resuspended in 400 μL of Nuclear Lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 1x complete) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Chromatin were sonicated for 10 min (high power, 30 s on-off repeats) to obtain an average size of 200-500 bp (Bioruptor, Diagenode). Soluble chromatin was obtained after sonicated nuclei were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Thirty micrograms of HEK293T cells chromatin were mixed with 2 μg of S2 cells chromatin and diluted 10 times with IP dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.15 M NaCl). Nucleosomes were isolated from supernatant by IP with 3 μg of H3K9me2 antibody overnight at 4C. Thirty microliter of washed Dynabeads™ M-280 Sheep Anti-Mouse IgG (11202D, Thermo Fisher) was added and samples were rotated for 2-3 hrs at 4C. IPed DNA/beads were washed with 1 mL of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.165 M NaCl) once, 1 mL of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 M NaCl) once, 1 mL of buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate and 0.25 M LiCl) and then 1 mL of buffer D (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0 and 1 mM EDTA) twice. Next IPed beads were incubated with 0.01 mg/mL RNase A (Ambion) in 300 μL of buffer E (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3 and 0.5 M NaCl) at 65°C for at least 4 hr. After RNase treatment, 30 μL of 10x Proteinase K mixture (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.5, 150 mM EDTA and Proteinase K 0.3 mg/mL) were added and then incubated at 45°C for 2 hrs. DNA fragments were isolated using ChIP DNA clean and concentrator columns (D5201, Zymoresearch) and quantified using Qubit Fluorometric Quantification. DNA libraries were made according to NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) manual, using 5 ng of DNA, and 10∼12 cycles of PCR were used to amplify the libraries. Deep sequencing was conducted on a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) by Novogene UK.
Raw data quality were checked with fastQC (v0.11.5) and preprocessed with TrimGalore (v0.4.4) ( Krueger, 2015 31. Krueger, F. Trim galore! 2015 http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ Google Scholar ) to remove possible sequencing adapters and to filter sequences by Phred quality scores (“-q 20 --length 10 --stringency 1). Reads were further aligned with bwa mem (v0.7.15-r1140) ( Li et al., 2009 33. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32751) PubMed Google Scholar ) against the ENSEMBLE GRCh38 and FlyBase dm6 genome assemblies, which correspond to Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster , respectively. Reads fully aligning in multiple regions were randomly assigned to one of those top score matches, using the aligner default parameters. Also, bitwise flags read paired (0x1) and read mapped in proper pair (0x2) were required using samtools (v1.11) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 46. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15098) PubMed Google Scholar ) . Duplicated reads were identified and removed with Picard MarkDuplicates (v2.24.0) ( Broad Institute, 2019 6. Broad Institute Picard toolkit, GitHub Repository 2019 http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ Google Scholar ). BedTools2 coverage (v2.29.2) (Heng et al., 2010) was employed to reveal the number of reads overlapping each analysed feature. The total number of mapped spike-in reads (SpkIn) per sample were counted and used as a normaliser as follows: 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑓 = 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑛 ∗ 0 . 0 1
For the downstream analyses, all raw read counts were multiplied by the scaling factor (Sf), giving the normalised counts.
Quality control for raw Illumina short-reads was performed using the FastQC tool ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ). Read adaptors were trimmed using TrimGalore ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ ) in paired-end mode, removing reads with less than 10 nucleotides (nt) and/or low-quality ends (20 Phred score cut-off). The resultant reads were aligned against the reference human genome (GRCh38) using STAR software ( Dobin et al., 2013 12. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ), requiring a minimum alignment score (–outFilterScoreMin) of 10.
Generated strand-specific pA+ RNA-seq data was used to identify expressed genes in HEK116 cell-line. Thus, Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 5. Bray, M.A. ∙ Singh, S. ∙ Han, H. ... Cell Painting, a high-content image-based assay for morphological profiling using multiplexed fluorescent dyes Nat. Protocols. 2016; 11 :1757-1774 Crossref Scopus (492) PubMed Google Scholar – Nature biotechnology) was used to map the reads against the human transcriptome (Ensembl v90), and TPM measurement for each transcription unit (TU) from the output was acquired. The transcript with highest TPM was selected per gene. Genes having no transcript with TPM higher than 4 were discarded. Moreover, filtered TUs must have protein-coding tag as a biotype, which was extracted from Ensembl GTF file version 90. To better detect signal levels from POINT technology, overlapping TUs were excluded. For that, an extra window of 10 Kb upstream and downstream of each TU was added. A final number of 2741 non-overlapping expressed genes was identified.
For sashimi plots generation, ggsashimi v1.0.0 ( https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006360 ) was used on RNA-seq samples, with the following parameters: -M 100 -s MATE2_SENSE -S plus . The 3 replicates per condition were given as input. The number of read counts supporting each event was internally aggregated using the replicates mean. The following table shows the number of read counts per replicate, separated by a semicolon: Control ASO1 VPA ASO1+VPA E6-E7 384; 930; 720 1002; 977; 994 1058; 1851; 1928 854; 2030; 1570 E7-E8 452; 1018; 854 1327; 1053; 1040 1216; 1921; 2075 1008; 2313; 1818 E6-E8 338; 1196; 636 370; 617; 361 1187; 970; 1172 339; 604; 441 Open table in a new tab
Previous identified expressed genes (N=2741 genes) were divided into 100 bins. For each bin, the overlapping number of fragment counts was measured with pysam ( Li and Durbin, 2009 33. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32751) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was then divided by the number of million reads mapped against the human genome, obtaining the Fragment counts per Million Mapped Reads .
Importantly, the 1% top and bottom extreme values per bin were remove, and the mean was measured excluding these values.
Promoter-proximal region was defined as a window from TSS to 1500bp downstream. From this point to TES it was considered gene body window. The gene set employed was the same as used in the meta-profiles (N=2741 genes). The number of fragment counts per window was obtained using pysam. Then, fragment counts were divided by window length, to accommodate for differences in gene size. Thus, the ratio between promoter-proximal and gene body regions was obtained by the division between the number of fragments in these respective windows, normalized to the window’s size. For the cases where no reads were found in the gene body, a value of zero was attributed. For the histogram, when there were not reads in the promoter-proximal region a value of zero was obtained by adding 1 unit to the ratio and by measuring the log2.
The ratio between the upstream and downstream regions of ASO1 target was obtained as described for promoter-proximal / gene body regions. Here, the upstream window considered was chr5:70951601-70951993 and the downstream chr5:70951993-70952250 .
Kallisto mapped RNA-seq reads against the human transcriptome to produce estimated gene expression values, which were then gathered in a non-normalized count matrix.
Using it as input, significant differentially expressed genes were detected with the DESeq2 package (10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8). A cut-off of 1×10 -5 for p-value and 1 for the absolute value of log2FoldChange was applied over DESeq2's own two-sided statistical test results. Volcano plots were generated with the EnhancedVolcano v1.8.0 package ( https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.EnhancedVolcano ).
Genome-wide splicing variation induced by VPA treatment were investigated with rMATS v4.1.1 ( https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1419161111 ). Ensembl human v90 was given as annotations. The following paraments were also given to rMATS: -t paired --readLength 150 --libType fr-firststrand. The output was then stringently filtered by maser package ( https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.maser ), thus an event was considered significant when the average number of reads per condition supporting the predominant class (inclusion or exclusion) was > 20, dPSI > 0.3 and FDR < 0.01. Scatter plot was obtained with the dotplot function of the maser package and represents the average PSI among the 3 replicates, per condition.
GraphPad Prism 9 was used for statistical analysis. One-way or two-way ANOVA tests were followed by Bonferroni’s corrected multiple comparisons between pairs of conditions, or TTEST comparisons were used with just two pair of conditions. Unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends, we analyzed three biological replicates for each data point in all graphs, and the level of significance was as follows: p < 0.05.
