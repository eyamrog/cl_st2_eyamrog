Title: Influenza Virus Z-RNAs Induce ZBP1-Mediated Necroptosis


Abstract: Summary

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a lytic RNA virus that triggers receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated pathways of apoptosis and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL)-dependent necroptosis in infected cells. ZBP1 initiates RIPK3-driven cell death by sensing IAV RNA and activating RIPK3. Here, we show that replicating IAV generates Z-RNAs, which activate ZBP1 in the nucleus of infected cells. ZBP1 then initiates RIPK3-mediated MLKL activation in the nucleus, resulting in nuclear envelope disruption, leakage of DNA into the cytosol, and eventual necroptosis. Cell death induced by nuclear MLKL was a potent activator of neutrophils, a cell type known to drive inflammatory pathology in virulent IAV disease. Consequently, MLKL-deficient mice manifest reduced nuclear disruption of lung epithelia, decreased neutrophil recruitment into infected lungs, and increased survival following a lethal dose of IAV. These results implicate Z-RNA as a new pathogen-associated molecular pattern and describe a ZBP1-initiated nucleus-to-plasma membrane “inside-out” death pathway with potentially pathogenic consequences in severe cases of influenza.

Section: Introduction

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. In aquatic birds, the primary IAV reservoir, virus replication occurs within the gastrointestinal tract and is typically asymptomatic. In contrast, mammalian IAV strains reproduce in respiratory tissues and generate symptoms ranging from mild cases of “the flu” to severe, sometimes lethal disease.
We and others have recently described a branched cell death pathway that is active in lung epithelial cells and that accounts for most cell death triggered by replicating IAV in these and other primary cell types ( Kuriakose et al., 2016; Nogusa et al., 2016; Thapa et al., 2016 21. Kuriakose, T. ∙ Man, S.M. ∙ Malireddi, R.K.S. ... ZBP1/DAI is an innate sensor of influenza virus triggering the NLRP3 inflammasome and programmed cell death pathways Sci.

DAI Senses Influenza A Virus Genomic RNA and Activates RIPK3-Dependent Cell Death Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :674-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). This pathway is initiated when the host protein ZBP1 (also called DAI) senses IAV RNAs and recruits receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) ( Thapa et al., 2016 44. Thapa, R.J. ∙ Ingram, J.P. ∙ Ragan, K.B. ... DAI Senses Influenza A Virus Genomic RNA and Activates RIPK3-Dependent Cell Death Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :674-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). RIPK3 then activates two parallel forms of cell death, necroptosis and apoptosis. Necroptosis requires RIPK3 kinase activity and is mediated by mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL). Apoptosis employs RIPK1, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and caspase-8, and it is independent of RIPK3 kinase activity ( Nogusa et al., 2016 30. Nogusa, S. ∙ Thapa, R.J. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ...

ZBP1 contains two Zα domains. These domains selectively bind left-handed double-helical “Z-form” RNA structures in vitro ( Brown et al., 2000; Placido et al., 2007 4. Brown, 2nd, B.A. ∙ Lowenhaupt, K. ∙ Wilbert, C.M. ... The zalpha domain of the editing enzyme dsRNA adenosine deaminase binds left-handed Z-RNA as well as Z-DNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :13532-13536 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Placido, D. ∙ Brown, 2nd, B.A. ∙ Lowenhaupt, K. ... A left-handed RNA double helix bound by the Z alpha domain of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 Structure. 2007; 15 :395-404 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), but whether Z-RNAs are produced during virus infections and serve as activating ligands for ZBP1 is unknown. Here, we show that orthomyxoviruses (IAV and IBV) produce Z-RNAs, and these Z-RNAs activate ZBP1 in infected nuclei. Once activated, ZBP1 stimulates RIPK3, which phosphorylates and activates MLKL in the nucleus. MLKL then triggers disruption of the nuclear envelope and promotes leakage of cellular DNA into the cytosol. Activated MLKL also traffics to the plasma membrane to mediate cell death by necroptosis.
Stimulating MLKL in the nucleus of fibroblasts potently activates neutrophils ex vivo , and Mlkl −/− mice displayed reduced nuclear damage in epithelial cells and dampened neutrophil recruitment upon IAV infection in vivo . Because neutrophils are established drivers of pathology in severe IAV disease ( Brandes et al., 2013; Camp and Jonsson, 2017 3. Brandes, M. ∙ Klauschen, F. ∙ Kuchen, S. ... A systems analysis identifies a feedforward inflammatory circuit leading to lethal influenza infection Cell. 2013; 154 :197-212 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar 5. Camp, J.V. ∙ Jonsson, C.B. A Role for Neutrophils in Viral Respiratory Disease Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :550 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), Mlkl −/− mice also fared significantly better than their wild-type counterparts following a lethal dose of this virus, without notable differences in virus replication rates. These findings provide evidence for Z-RNA as a new PAMP, and delineate a ZBP1-initiated “inside-out” nucleus-to-plasma membrane death signaling pathway with pathogenic consequences during severe influenza infections.

Section: Results

IAV (H1N1 strain Puerto Rico/8/1934; hereafter PR8) triggers extensive cytopathic effect (CPE) and death in primary wild-type murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) starting at between 8 and 12 h post-infection (p.i.); by 24 h, over 60% of wild-type MEFs are dead ( Figure 1 A). In the same time frame, however, we observed minimal CPE and >80%–85% viability of similarly infected Zbp1 −/− or Ripk3 −/− MEFs ( Figure 1 A). In wild-type MEFs, synthesis of each of the eight IAV negative-sense viral RNA segments (vRNAs) was evident by 2–4 h p.i. and peaked by ∼8 h p.i. ( Figure 1 B), preceding production of IAV proteins, which was first seen 4–6 h p.i. ( Figure 1 C). To extend these studies to human cells, we made HT-29 cells competent for IAV-induced cell death signaling by stably transducing them with FLAG-tagged human ZBP1 ( Figure S1 A). In these cells, IAV proteins were observed 2–4 h p.i. ( Figure S1 B). Activation of ZBP1, as measured by phosphorylation of MLKL (pMLKL), was seen in whole-cell extracts 3–6 h p.i. in murine cells ( Figure 1 C) or 2–4 h p.i. in human cells ( Figure S1 B), coincident with the onset of virus protein synthesis.
As IAV replicates in the nucleus, we next examined whether activation of necroptosis was initiated in the nucleus. IAV-infected MEFs displayed a distinct pMLKL signal starting at ∼6 h p.i.; this signal was first observed in the nucleus, before becoming evident in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membranes of infected cells between 9–12 h p.i. ( Figure 1 D, quantified in 1 E). In contrast, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-initiated pMLKL signal was first detected in the cytoplasm and only later in the nucleus, as previously reported ( Weber et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2016 48. Weber, K. ∙ Roelandt, R. ∙ Bruggeman, I. ... Nuclear RIPK3 and MLKL contribute to cytosolic necrosome formation and necroptosis Commun. Biol. 2018; 1 :6 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Yoon, S. ∙ Bogdanov, K. ∙ Kovalenko, A. ... Necroptosis is preceded by nuclear translocation of the signaling proteins that induce it Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23 :253-260 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 F and S1 C). Staining IAV-infected HT-29 FLAG-ZBP1 cells for pMLKL showed a readily observable nuclear signal staining by 4 h p.i., followed by cytoplasmic dispersal and plasma membrane localization by 8 h p.i. ( Figure 1 G, quantified in 1 H). In these cells, TNF-α-activated pMLKL was primarily cytoplasmic, detectable within 2 h post-treatment, and seen at the plasma membrane by 4 h ( Figures 1 I and S1 D). These results indicate that IAV-activated ZBP1-RIPK3 necroptosis signaling, unlike canonical TNF-α-induced necroptosis, is initiated in the nucleus.
We next tested if ZBP1 sensed IAV RNAs in the nucleus. Our previous RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) results ( Thapa et al., 2016 44. Thapa, R.J. ∙ Ingram, J.P. ∙ Ragan, K.B. ... DAI Senses Influenza A Virus Genomic RNA and Activates RIPK3-Dependent Cell Death Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :674-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ) have shown that ZBP1 may preferentially associate with shorter IAV genomic RNAs, including defective viral genomes (DVGs) derived from the PB1, PB2, and PA gene segments, and such DVGs may represent activating ligands for ZBP1. These DVGs are produced when the IAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase initiates vRNA synthesis, but falls off its genomic template before re-engaging further downstream to complete transcription. Such DVG RNAs nonetheless retain their packaging signals, and are encapsidated into virion-like “defective interfering” (DI) particles ( Nayak et al., 1985 28. Nayak, D.P. ∙ Chambers, T.M. ∙ Akkina, R.K. Defective-interfering (DI) RNAs of influenza viruses: origin, structure, expression, and interference Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 114 :103-151 PubMed Google Scholar ). IAV PR8 stocks typically contain some fraction of DI particles, but can be grown under conditions that are enriched in, or largely lack, DI particles ( Xue et al., 2016 50. Xue, J. ∙ Chambers, B.S. ∙ Hensley, S.E. ... Propagation and Characterization of Influenza Virus Stocks That Lack High Levels of Defective Viral Genomes and Hemagglutinin Mutations Front. Microbiol. 2016; 7 :326 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ); these stocks therefore either have high (HD) or low (LD) levels of DVG RNAs, respectively ( Figure 2 A). When we infected wild-type MEFs with equivalent amounts of IAV HD or IAV LD virus, we found that IAV HD caused ∼60% cell death by 12 h whereas an equivalent inoculum of IAV LD killed <20% of infected cells at this time point ( Figure 2 B). Only at 18 h p.i. did IAV LD induce cell death to levels that were comparable to IAV HD ( Figure 2 B), presumably because DVGs began to also accumulate in IAV LD-infected cells ( Xue et al., 2016 50. Xue, J. ∙ Chambers, B.S. ∙ Hensley, S.E. ... Propagation and Characterization of Influenza Virus Stocks That Lack High Levels of Defective Viral Genomes and Hemagglutinin Mutations Front. Microbiol. 2016; 7 :326 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). IAV HD triggered MLKL phosphorylation earlier ( Figures 2 C and 2D) and more robustly ( Figures 2 C and 2E) than IAV LD. Because these results strongly indicate that IAV DVGs are dominant ZBP1 activating ligands, we next tested if ZBP1 associated with DVGs in the nucleus of infected cells. We stably reconstituted Zbp1 −/− MEFs with FLAG-tagged murine ZBP1, infected these cells with IAV, eluted RNA co-precipitating with either nuclear or cytoplasmic ZBP1, and examined eluates (as well as input lysates) for DVG RNA. We observed PA-segment-derived DVG RNAs in the nuclear input fraction, starting at ∼4 h post-infection, and at much lower levels in the cytoplasm later in the course of infection ( Figure 2 F). Importantly, we were able to readily detect these DVGs co-precipitating with ZBP1 solely in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2 F), and when ZBP1-RNA complexes were crosslinked before immunoprecipitation ( Figures S4 A and S4B). RNA-seq of ZBP1-bound nuclear PA segment-derived RNAs confirmed that the DVG sequences mapped to the 5′ and 3′ termini of the PA segment, demonstrating that they represent internally deleted sub-genomic RNAs ( Figure 2 G). Together, these results support the idea that ZBP1 senses IAV DVGs and initiates cell death signaling in the nucleus of infected cells.
ZBP1 has two Zα domains, the second of which (Zα2) is essential for sensing IAV RNAs ( Thapa et al., 2016 44. Thapa, R.J. ∙ Ingram, J.P. ∙ Ragan, K.B. ... DAI Senses Influenza A Virus Genomic RNA and Activates RIPK3-Dependent Cell Death Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :674-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Zα domains bind Z-RNA, but not A-RNA, the right-handed double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) duplex that is structurally very different from Z-RNA ( Figure 3 A) and that serves as ligand for other dsRNA-binding innate sensors, such as MDA-5 and PKR ( Kawai and Akira, 2006 17. Kawai, T. ∙ Akira, S. Innate immune recognition of viral infection Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7 :131-137 Crossref Scopus (1534) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations suggest that ZBP1-activating IAV RNAs adopt the Z-conformation, but whether Z-RNAs are produced during virus infections is unknown. A previous study used in situ antibody-based staining to show that Tetrahymena cytoplasm contains Z-RNA, demonstrating that Z-RNAs do exist in nature, and that an immunofluorescence approach to detecting Z-RNA in fixed cells is feasible ( Zarling et al., 1987 53. Zarling, D.A. ∙ Calhoun, C.J. ∙ Hardin, C.C. ... Cytoplasmic Z-RNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84 :6117-6121 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although no antibodies to Z-RNA are currently available, Z-RNA and Z-DNA share very similar structures, and several antisera raised to Z-DNA cross-react with Z-RNA in vitro ( Hardin et al., 1987, 1988; Zarling et al., 1990 10. Hardin, C.C. ∙ Zarling, D.A. ∙ Puglisi, J.D. ... Stabilization of Z-RNA by chemical bromination and its recognition by anti-Z-DNA antibodies Biochemistry. 1987; 26 :5191-5199 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar 11. Hardin, C.C. ∙ Zarling, D.A. ∙ Wolk, S.K. ... Characterization of anti-Z-RNA polyclonal antibodies: epitope properties and recognition of Z-DNA Biochemistry. 1988; 27 :4169-4177 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Zarling, D.A. ∙ Calhoun, C.J. ∙ Feuerstein, B.G. ... Cytoplasmic microinjection of immunoglobulin Gs recognizing RNA helices inhibits human cell growth J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211 :147-160 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine if anti-Z-DNA antisera could also detect Z-RNA in cells, we first synthesized a Z-RNA duplex using a newly described approach in which 2′- O -methyl-8-methyl modification of guanosine nucleosides (m 8 Gm) allows the stabilization of CG-repeat dsRNA in the Z-conformation ( Balasubramaniyam et al., 2018 2. Balasubramaniyam, T. ∙ Ishizuka, T. ∙ Xiao, C.D. ... 2′- O -Methyl-8-methylguanosine as a Z-Form RNA Stabilizer for Structural and Functional Study of Z-RNA Molecules. 2018; 23 :2572 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). The introduction of a methyl group at the C8 position strongly favors the syn conformation of guanosine, and modeling this modification in a CG-repeat dsRNA indicates that RNA duplexes containing m 8 Gm can undergo an A → Z transition with energetically favorable dynamics ( Figure 3 B). In fact, replacing the majority of guanosines with m 8 Gm analogs in CG-repeat dsRNAs produces Z-RNAs that are remarkably stable at physiological salt concentrations in vitro ( Balasubramaniyam et al., 2018 2. Balasubramaniyam, T. ∙ Ishizuka, T. ∙ Xiao, C.D. ... 2′- O -Methyl-8-methylguanosine as a Z-Form RNA Stabilizer for Structural and Functional Study of Z-RNA Molecules. 2018; 23 :2572 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore synthesized a hairpin CG-repeat Z-RNA in which most guanosines were modified to m 8 Gm, and, as a control, generated an identical A-RNA hairpin without the m 8 Gm modification ( Figure 3 C, top). We then attached a fluorescent (FAM) label to each RNA hairpin and used these RNAs to screen anti-Z-DNA antibodies for their capacity to selectively detect Z-RNA. From this screen, we identified a sheep polyclonal antiserum raised against Z-DNA (hereafter, anti-Z-NA antiserum) that potently and completely retarded the mobility of synthetic m 8 Gm-containing Z-RNA, but not A-RNA, in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay in vitro ( Figure 3 C, bottom). Encouraged by this result, we transfected FAM-labeled Z-RNA or A-RNA hairpins into cells and tested if the anti-Z-NA antiserum can detect Z-RNA in cellulo . The anti-Z-NA antiserum produced a specific signal that co-localized with FAM-labeled Z-RNA in almost all (∼95%) transfected cells ( Figure 3 D, quantified in 3 E), and with the majority (∼80%) of FAM-positive foci in these cells ( Figure 3 F). Importantly, this antiserum did not detect transfected FAM-labeled A-RNA ( Figures 3 D–3F). These data demonstrate that the anti-Z-NA antiserum can specifically recognize the presence of Z-RNA in cells.
Using this antiserum, we observed a modest RNase-sensitive nuclear signal in IAV-infected cells, but not in uninfected cells ( Figure S2 A). A previous study found that IAV-infected cells require protease treatment before IAV RNAs can be detected by antibodies, likely because these RNAs are masked by cellular or viral proteins ( Son et al., 2015 42. Son, K.N. ∙ Liang, Z. ∙ Lipton, H.L. Double-Stranded RNA Is Detected by Immunofluorescence Analysis in RNA and DNA Virus Infections, Including Those by Negative-Stranded RNA Viruses J. Virol. 2015; 89 :9383-9392 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore exposed IAV-infected cells to proteinase K for 40 min post-fixation, before staining them with anti-Z-NA antiserum, and were now able to readily detect a nuclear signal that was first seen 2–4 h p.i. and increased in intensity over the 12 h time course of this experiment ( Figure 3 G, quantified in S2 C). The strength of the Z-RNA signal was proportionate to the amount of virus inoculum and correlated with the extent of virus replication, as measured by immunofluorescent detection of nucleoprotein (NP) in the same nuclei ( Figure S2 B, quantified in S2 D). The signal produced by the anti-Z-NA antiserum was sensitive to treatment with RNases III and A, insensitive to DNase I, and abolished by exposure of cells to the IAV replication inhibitor nucleozin ( Kao et al., 2010 15. Kao, R.Y. ∙ Yang, D. ∙ Lau, L.S. ... Identification of influenza A nucleoprotein as an antiviral target Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :600-605 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ) pre-infection ( Figure 3 H, quantified to S2 E; RNase A and DNase I enzymes are bioactive at the concentrations used in this experiment [ Figures S2 G–S2I]). Z-RNA staining was also observed in IAV-infected human (A549) and murine (LET1) cell lines derived from airway epithelium ( Figure 3 I) and was effectively quenched by excess synthetic Z-RNA, but not by equivalent amounts of A-RNA or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) ( Figure S2 J, quantified in S2 K). Notably, a second antibody (mouse monoclonal Ab, clone Z-22) raised to Z-DNA and previously shown to cross-react with Z-RNA ( Zarling et al., 1990 54. Zarling, D.A. ∙ Calhoun, C.J. ∙ Feuerstein, B.G. ... Cytoplasmic microinjection of immunoglobulin Gs recognizing RNA helices inhibits human cell growth J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211 :147-160 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) also specifically and robustly bound Z-RNA in vitro ( Figure S3 A) and readily detected its presence in cells ( Figures S3 B–S3D). Staining IAV-infected cells with this antibody following proteinase K treatment produced a dose- and time-dependent nuclear signal that was abolished by RNase A treatment and selectively quenched by excess Z-RNA ( Figures S3 E, S3G, S3I, quantified in S3F, S3 H, S3J).
In agreement with the idea that IAV DVGs are a dominant source of Z-RNA, the Z-NA antiserum robustly stained nuclei in MEFs infected with IAV HD, but not in those infected with an equivalent amount of IAV LD, at 6 h p.i. ( Figure 3 J, quantified in S2 F), when activation of MLKL and induction of cell death are evident in IAV HD- but not IAV LD-infected cells. Other orthomyxoviruses, including seasonal strains of IAV and IBV, also produced nuclear Z-RNA ( Figure 3 K), whereas a rhabdovirus (VSV) or a poliovirus (EMCV) did not generate detectable Z-RNA ( Figure 3 K). Each of these viruses, however, generated strong cytoplasmic A-RNA signals ( Figure 3 K), as previously reported ( Son et al., 2015 42. Son, K.N. ∙ Liang, Z. ∙ Lipton, H.L. Double-Stranded RNA Is Detected by Immunofluorescence Analysis in RNA and DNA Virus Infections, Including Those by Negative-Stranded RNA Viruses J. Virol. 2015; 89 :9383-9392 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with the idea that Z-RNAs are activating ligands for ZBP1, only orthomyxoviruses triggered ZBP1-dependent MLKL phosphorylation ( Figure 3 L, bottom) and cell death ( Figure 3 L, top) in MEFs. Collectively, these data provide evidence that replicating orthomyxoviruses produce Z-RNAs. They also show that these Z-RNAs are primarily localized to the nucleus, likely of DVG origin, and may function as ZBP1 ligands.
To test if ZBP1 sensed Z-RNAs in the nucleus, we first examined the cellular location of ZBP1 following infection with IAV. ZBP1 is primarily a cytoplasmic protein in uninfected MEFs, but rapidly accumulates in the nucleus following IAV infection ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Notably, a deletion mutant of ZBP1 lacking its two Zα domains (ΔZα), and hence incapable of binding viral RNA ( Figures S4 A and S4B), does not enter the nucleus, suggesting that the mechanism by which ZBP1 is recruited into the nucleus upon IAV infection may involve association with viral or cellular nucleic acids ( Figure 4 B, quantified in 4 C). By the use of limited (20 min) proteinase K treatment, we were able to preserve a significant amount of polypeptide-based nuclear antigenicity but also unmask sufficient Z-RNA for detection with the Z-NA antiserum. Under these conditions, we observed distinct nucleoplasmic areas with co-localization of ZBP1 and Z-RNA ( Figure 4 D). RIPK3 and MLKL associate with ZBP1, but not mutants of ZBP1 lacking RNA binding (ΔZα) or RIPK3 signaling (RHIM-Amut) capacity upon IAV infection ( Figure 4 E). Because a significant proportion of the downstream necroptosis signaling components RIPK3 and MLKL are also nuclear ( Figure 4 A), and because RIPK3 activity was required for MLKL phosphorylation in IAV-infected nuclei ( Figure S4 C), we next tested if restricting ZBP1 to the nucleus was sufficient to activate necroptosis. By affixing either two tandem nuclear localization sequences (NLS) or nuclear export sequences (NES) onto the N terminus of ZBP1, we were able to, respectively, localize most (>90%) ZBP1 to the nucleus (ZBP1-Nuc) or largely retain this protein in the cytosol (ZBP1-Cyto) ( Figure 4 F, left). Cells expressing ZBP1-Nuc succumbed to virus with notably faster kinetics and increased magnitude than cells expressing an equivalent amount of wild-type ZBP1 ( Figure 4 F, right). In contrast, cells expressing ZBP1-Cyto were moderately more resistant to IAV-triggered cell death than controls ( Figure 4 F, right). Collectively, these results show that ZBP1 is recruited into the nucleus of infected cells, where it co-localizes with IAV Z-RNAs and initiates RIPK3-mediated cell death signaling. It is, however, noteworthy that ZBP1-Cyto remains largely restricted to the cytoplasm even after infection ( Figure S4 D), indicating that ZBP1 does not need to signal from the nucleus to activate cell death (see Discussion ).
During the course of these studies, we consistently observed alterations in nuclear morphology, characterized by breaches in the nuclear envelope and protrusion of host DNA into the cytosol, in approximately half of all dying MEFs. The inner and outer nuclear membranes both contain phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol phosphates that serve as MLKL attractants in the plasma membrane ( Dondelinger et al., 2014; Kleinig, 1970; Wang et al., 2014 8. Dondelinger, Y. ∙ Declercq, W. ∙ Montessuit, S. ...

Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein MLKL causes necrotic membrane disruption upon phosphorylation by RIP3 Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :133-146 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1193) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising the possibility that these phospholipids might also draw MLKL to nuclear membranes and lead to their rupture during IAV-activated necroptosis. To test if MLKL was responsible for nuclear envelope rupture in IAV-infected cells, we first examined nuclear morphology and nuclear envelope integrity in wild-type MEFs over an 18 h time course of IAV infection. Immunofluorescence imaging of the nuclear lamina protein lamin B1 and the inner membrane protein emerin in uninfected cells showed ovoid nuclei with well demarcated boundaries ( Figure 5 A). Within 6 h of infection, however, large gaps in lamin B1 staining ( Figure 5 A, top panels), as well as breaches, involutions, blebs, and other aberrancies in the emerin signal ( Figure 5 A, middle panels), became evident. Interestingly, DAPI staining for host DNA showed large cytosolic extrusions of herniated genomic material within 6 h p.i. in a significant proportion of infected cells ( Figure 5 A, bottom panels). Reconstructing images of damaged nuclei in three dimensions showed that DNA appeared to herniate from areas of breached lamina (i.e., absence of lamin B1 staining), and in many cases, these DNA blebs were decorated with emerin ( Figure 5 B). Quantifying disruptions to the nuclear envelope showed that fully one-half of all dying cells (and approximately one-third of all cells) had ruptured nuclear envelopes and manifested evidence of DNA leakage into the cytosol by 18 h p.i. ( Figure 5 C). Co-staining infected cells for MLKL and emerin demonstrated co-localization of MLKL with the nuclear envelope in infected wild-type MEFs ( Figure 5 D). Mlkl −/− MEFs were mostly resistant to IAV-induced membrane damage, but reintroducing MLKL expression in Mlkl −/− MEFs restored to wild-type levels the number of cells with nuclear rupture and DNA leakage ( Figures S5 A and S5B). These results demonstrate that MLKL can localize to nuclear membranes and is a dominant instigator of nuclear envelope damage during IAV infection.
Next, we examined if, in the absence of IAV, activating MLKL in the nucleus is sufficient to trigger nuclear membrane damage. We have previously shown that the N-terminal 140 amino acids of MLKL, comprising its effector helix bundle domain and brace region, is a potent inducer of necroptosis when activated by chemically induced oligomerization ( Quarato et al., 2016 33. Quarato, G. ∙ Guy, C.S. ∙ Grace, C.R. ... Sequential Engagement of Distinct MLKL Phosphatidylinositol-Binding Sites Executes Necroptosis Mol. Cell. 2016; 61 :589-601 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). By attaching two tandem nuclear localization sequences to this segment of MLKL, we were able to almost wholly restrict its expression to the nucleus and found that nuclear localized MLKL 1–140 (hereafter MLKL-Nuc) was able to induce cell death upon activation, albeit with significantly slower kinetics than cytosolic MLKL 1–140 (MLKL-Cyto; Figure 5 E). Whereas ∼80% of MLKL-Cyto-expressing cells were dead by 30 min post-activation, it took 16–24 h for MLKL-Nuc-containing cells to achieve comparable levels of cell death ( Figure 5 E). MLKL-Nuc in unstimulated cells displayed a diffuse signal that was almost completely contained within the nucleus, but transitioned within 4 h of activation to a pattern of large aggregates, many of which were seen along the nuclear periphery ( Figure 5 F). Accompanying these alterations in the distribution of MLKL-Nuc were gross distortions in the architecture of the nuclear envelope ( Figure 5 F). Most dying cells displayed ruptured nuclear envelopes, with detectable herniated DNA in over a third of these cells, by 6 h ( Figure 5 F). These results are quantified in Figure 5 G. Cells expressing activated MLKL-Cyto, in contrast, showed only modest evidence of distorted nuclear architecture and little detectable DNA leakage, at a time point when the extent of cell death was comparable to cells with active MLKL-Nuc ( Figures S5 C and S5D). By 4–6 h post-activation, MLKL-Nuc was evident in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane ( Figures 5 H–5J). Also seen in the cytosol of cells harboring activated MLKL-Nuc by 6 h was the nuclear protein HMGB1 ( Figure 5 J). Treatment of MLKL-Nuc-expressing cells with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B 1 h post-activation was able to retain a significant fraction of MLKL in the nucleus ( Figure S5 E) and partially protect against both nuclear envelope rupture ( Figure S5 F) and cell death ( Figure S5 G).
ZBP1-RIPK3 signaling activates not only necroptosis, but also apoptosis, via a RIPK1-FADD-caspase-8 axis, in infected cells ( Nogusa et al., 2016 30. Nogusa, S. ∙ Thapa, R.J. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ... RIPK3 Activates Parallel Pathways of MLKL-Driven Necroptosis and FADD-Mediated Apoptosis to Protect against Influenza A Virus Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :13-24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine if apoptosis was required for nuclear envelope disruption upon activation of ZBP1-RIPK3 cell death signaling, we first confirmed that ZBP1 itself was necessary for nuclear envelope rupture in IAV infected cells. Approximately half of all infected primary wild-type MEFs displayed ruptured nuclear envelopes, but only ∼10% of Zbp1 −/− MEFs did so; the remaining cells had intact nuclei ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Reconstituting Zbp1 −/− MEFs with wild-type ZBP1, or with deletion mutants of ZBP1 that lack the Zα1 domain (ZBP1 ΔZα1) or the C-terminal third (ZBP1 ΔC) of this protein ( Figure S6 ) but are nonetheless competent for cell-death signaling ( Thapa et al., 2016 44. Thapa, R.J. ∙ Ingram, J.P. ∙ Ragan, K.B. ... DAI Senses Influenza A Virus Genomic RNA and Activates RIPK3-Dependent Cell Death Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :674-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ), restored their capacity to undergo nuclear envelope rupture and vent DNA into the cytosol ( Figures 6 A and 6B). In contrast, reconstituting Zbp1 −/− MEFs with mutants of ZBP1 that either fail to bind IAV RNA (ZBP1 Zα2mut) or signal to RIPK3 (ZBP1 RHIM-Amut) ( Figure S6 ) prevented both nuclear envelope rupture as well as DNA herniation ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Exposing wild-type MEFs to the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD, which blocks IAV-activated apoptosis, did not prevent nuclear envelope rupture or DNA extrusion ( Figures 6 C and 6D), but pretreating wild-type MEFs with the RIPK3 kinase inhibitor GSK′843, which selectively blocks MLKL activation and necroptosis ( Mandal et al., 2014 22. Mandal, P. ∙ Berger, S.B. ∙ Pillay, S. ... RIP3 induces apoptosis independent of pronecrotic kinase activity Mol. Cell. 2014; 56 :481-495 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (474) PubMed Google Scholar ), or with the combination of zVAD and GSK′843, which prevents all IAV-activated cell death ( Nogusa et al., 2016 30. Nogusa, S. ∙ Thapa, R.J. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ... RIPK3 Activates Parallel Pathways of MLKL-Driven Necroptosis and FADD-Mediated Apoptosis to Protect against Influenza A Virus Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :13-24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ), effectively blocked damage to the nuclear membrane ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Similarly, cells lacking RIPK3 or MLKL were resistant to IAV-triggered nuclear membrane rupture ( Figures 6 C and 6D), while cells lacking RIPK1 ( Ripk1 −/− ) or harboring non-cleavable knockin alleles of caspase-8 ( Casp8 DA ; this allele encodes a D387A point mutant of caspase-8) ( Kang et al., 2008 14. Kang, T.B. ∙ Oh, G.S. ∙ Scandella, E. ... Mutation of a self-processing site in caspase-8 compromises its apoptotic but not its nonapoptotic functions in bacterial artificial chromosome-transgenic mice J. Immunol. 2008; 181 :2522-2532 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), and therefore selectively defective in apoptosis signaling downstream of RIPK3 ( Nogusa et al., 2016 30. Nogusa, S. ∙ Thapa, R.J. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ... RIPK3 Activates Parallel Pathways of MLKL-Driven Necroptosis and FADD-Mediated Apoptosis to Protect against Influenza A Virus Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :13-24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ), were as sensitive as wild-type cells to nuclear membrane damage and DNA leakage upon IAV infection ( Figures 6 C and 6D). In contrast to the necroptosis axis, which is first activated in the nucleus, apoptosis signaling (as measured by staining for activated caspase-3) appears to be a predominantly cytoplasmic event, for reasons that are currently unclear ( Figure 6 E). Interestingly, MEFs undergoing either death receptor-triggered necroptosis (TCZ, in which the pMLKL signal originates in cytoplasm), or apoptosis (TRAIL + CHX), did not display detectable evidence of nuclear envelope rupture or herniated DNA in the cytosol ( Figures 6 F and 6G), although both stimuli resulted in misshapen nuclei, and in the case of cells undergoing apoptosis, pronounced nuclear shrinkage ( Figure 6 F). Thus, apoptosis is not required for nuclear envelope rupture following IAV infection.
To evaluate the role of necroptosis in IAV-triggered inflammatory responses in vivo , we compared disease and survival outcomes in Mlkl −/− mice to their wild-type counterparts, as well as to Zbp1 −/− and Ripk3 −/− animals. At a modestly lethal dose (EID 2500 , ∼LD 20 ) of IAV (strain PR8), we found that Mlkl −/− mice were not any more susceptible to lethality than wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice, whereas both Zbp1 −/− and Ripk3 −/− mice displayed significantly increased rates of mortality ( Figure 7 A). Because Zbp1 −/− and Ripk3 −/− animals are deficient in both apoptosis and necroptosis signaling, their increased susceptibility to IAV likely arises from a failure to eliminate infected cells and limit virus spread in pulmonary tissue ( Nogusa et al., 2016; Upton et al., 2017 30. Nogusa, S. ∙ Thapa, R.J. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ... RIPK3 Activates Parallel Pathways of MLKL-Driven Necroptosis and FADD-Mediated Apoptosis to Protect against Influenza A Virus Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :13-24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Upton, J.W. ∙ Shubina, M. ∙ Balachandran, S. RIPK3-driven cell death during virus infections Immunol. Rev. 2017; 277 :90-101 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mlkl −/− mice are deficient only in necroptosis; in these animals, apoptosis signaling is still intact and can effectively mediate virus clearance ( Nogusa et al., 2016 30. Nogusa, S. ∙ Thapa, R.J. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ... RIPK3 Activates Parallel Pathways of MLKL-Driven Necroptosis and FADD-Mediated Apoptosis to Protect against Influenza A Virus Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :13-24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, when we challenged Mlkl −/− mice with a lethal dose (EID 6000 ) of IAV, they manifested notably better survival outcomes than any of the other genotypes: 40% of Mlkl −/− survived at this dose of virus and made full recoveries by 3 weeks p.i. ( Figure 7 B). Expectedly, all Zbp1 −/− and Ripk3 −/− mice succumbed within 2 weeks of infection at this dose ( Figure 7 B). We did not find significant differences in either lung virus burden ( Figure 7 C) or CD8 + T cell-driven adaptive immune responses to IAV ( Figure 7 D) between Mlkl −/− mice and their littermate controls ( Mlkl +/+ ). The gating strategy used to identify IAV-specific CD8 + T cells is shown in Figure S7 A. We did, however, observe that lungs from Mlkl −/− mice had notably fewer epithelial cells with disrupted nuclei, compared to similarly infected lungs from wild-type animals ( Figure 7 E).
The nucleus contains immunogenic damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), including HMGB1 and DNA itself, that when released into the extracellular space, can recruit innate cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, and stimulate an inflammatory response. Because neutrophils, in particular, are important drivers of IAV pathogenesis ( Brandes et al., 2013; Camp and Jonsson, 2017 3. Brandes, M. ∙ Klauschen, F. ∙ Kuchen, S. ... A systems analysis identifies a feedforward inflammatory circuit leading to lethal influenza infection Cell. 2013; 154 :197-212 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar 5. Camp, J.V. ∙ Jonsson, C.B. A Role for Neutrophils in Viral Respiratory Disease Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :550 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), and because we had noticed that both HMGB1 and DNA were released into the cytosol following MLKL-mediated nuclear rupture ( Figures 5 A–5C and 5J), we next evaluated the effect of activating MLKL in the nucleus of cells on the capacity of these dying cells to stimulate neutrophils ex vivo . Activation of both MLKL-Cyto and MLKL-Nuc kill MEFs, albeit with different kinetics, as we have shown earlier ( Figure 5 E). By 10 min post-addition of oligomerizer, ∼80% of cells expressing MLKL-Cyto were dead, whereas MLKL-Nuc killed a similar proportion of cells only ∼18 h after activation ( Figure 7 F). Notably, however, over 50% of dying cells expressing MLKL-Nuc showed evidence of nuclear envelope damage, while <20% of dying cells with MLKL-Cyto manifested disrupted nuclei ( Figure 7 F). We collected supernatants from cells expressing either MLKL-Cyto or MLKL-Nuc at a time when death in each case was ∼80% (i.e., at 10 min or 18 h post-oligomerizer, respectively), used these supernatants to stimulate primary cultures of neutrophils, and quantified neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as a readout of neutrophil activation. While supernatants from untreated cells triggered NETs in <10% of primary murine neutrophils, those from dying cells expressing active cytoplasmic MLKL-Cyto induced NET formation in ∼30% of neutrophils ( Figures 7 G and S7 B). Supernatants from MLKL-Nuc cells, however, induced NETs in a significantly greater proportion (∼50%) of challenged neutrophils ( Figures 7 G and S7 B). These supernatants also contained significantly higher levels of the nuclear DAMPs HMGB1 ( Figure 7 H) and interleukin (IL)-33 ( Figure 7 I). Collectively, these results demonstrate that MLKL-activated nuclear envelope rupture during IAV infection releases nuclear DAMPs, serves as a potent stimulator of neutrophils in cell culture, and by promoting the recruitment and activation of neutrophils into the infected lung, may contribute to the severity of IAV disease in vivo .
In line with these findings, we found a remarkable attenuation (by ∼50%) in the degree of neutrophil infiltration (MPO + cells; Figure 7 J, quantified in 7 K) and consequent formation of NETs, (measured by staining for citrinullated-H3) in Mlkl −/− lungs between days 3 and 7 after infection with a lethal dose of IAV ( Figure 7 J, quantified in 7 L). Supernatants from IAV-infected Mlkl +/+ MEFs induced NET formation in ∼50% of neutrophils when added to cultures of these cells e x vivo , whereas supernatants from similarly infected Mlkl −/− MEFs activated NET formation in <20% of neutrophils, comparable to those from uninfected controls ( Figure 7 M, quantified in 7 N). These results are suggestive of an unanticipated role for MLKL signaling in driving pathogenesis during severe IAV infections, with potentially important clinical ramifications.

Section: Discussion

In this report, we show that IAV and other orthomyxoviruses produce Z-RNAs and propose that these Z-RNAs serve as activating ligands for ZBP1. For many years, Z-RNA duplexes were not believed to form under natural conditions ( Athanasiadis, 2012; Brown et al., 2000 1. Athanasiadis, A. Zalpha-domains: at the intersection between RNA editing and innate immunity Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 23 :275-280 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar 4. Brown, 2nd, B.A. ∙ Lowenhaupt, K. ∙ Wilbert, C.M. ... The zalpha domain of the editing enzyme dsRNA adenosine deaminase binds left-handed Z-RNA as well as Z-DNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :13532-13536 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ), but prior to the current study, several lines of evidence supported the idea that Z-RNAs do occur in nature: Z-RNAs have been detected in Tetrahymena ( Zarling et al., 1987 53. Zarling, D.A. ∙ Calhoun, C.J. ∙ Hardin, C.C. ... Cytoplasmic Z-RNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84 :6117-6121 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ); proteins containing Zα domains, most notably ADAR1 ( Samuel, 2011 39. Samuel, C.E. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are both antiviral and proviral Virology. 2011; 411 :180-193 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ZBP1 ( Kuriakose et al., 2016; Thapa et al., 2016 21. Kuriakose, T. ∙ Man, S.M. ∙ Malireddi, R.K.S. ... ZBP1/DAI is an innate sensor of influenza virus triggering the NLRP3 inflammasome and programmed cell death pathways Sci.

DAI Senses Influenza A Virus Genomic RNA and Activates RIPK3-Dependent Cell Death Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :674-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ), respond to RNA viruses; Zα domains associate with Z-RNA in vitro ( Brown et al., 2000; Placido et al., 2007 4. Brown, 2nd, B.A. ∙ Lowenhaupt, K. ∙ Wilbert, C.M. ... The zalpha domain of the editing enzyme dsRNA adenosine deaminase binds left-handed Z-RNA as well as Z-DNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :13532-13536 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Placido, D. ∙ Brown, 2nd, B.A. ∙ Lowenhaupt, K. ... A left-handed RNA double helix bound by the Z alpha domain of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 Structure. 2007; 15 :395-404 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ); and Zα domains can convert A-RNA to Z-RNA under near-physiological conditions ( Brown et al., 2000 4. Brown, 2nd, B.A. ∙ Lowenhaupt, K. ∙ Wilbert, C.M. ... The zalpha domain of the editing enzyme dsRNA adenosine deaminase binds left-handed Z-RNA as well as Z-DNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :13532-13536 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results now demonstrate that newly formed IAV RNA duplexes may adopt the Z-confirmation. We suggest these Z-RNA structures arise as a consequence of torsional stress induced by negative supercoiling during viral replication, as has been shown to occur with dsDNA during cellular transcription ( Rich and Zhang, 2003; Wittig et al., 1991 34. Rich, A. ∙ Zhang, S. Timeline: Z-DNA: the long road to biological function Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4 :566-572 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Wittig, B. ∙ Dorbic, T. ∙ Rich, A. Transcription is associated with Z-DNA formation in metabolically active permeabilized mammalian cell nuclei Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88 :2259-2263 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). The primary source of ZBP1-activating ligands appears to be Z-RNAs derived from DVGs, rather than from full-length genomes. We currently have no reason to believe that DVG RNAs are any more likely than full-length genomic RNA duplexes to form Z-RNA structures during replication. DVG RNAs may provide a dominant source of Z-RNA ligands for ZBP1 simply because, compared to full-length genomic RNAs, DVG RNAs are often produced in great excess during virus replication and are improperly packaged for encapsidation, making them more accessible to sensing by innate host defense mechanisms. Whether IAV RNAs may additionally undergo an A → Z transition upon interaction with ZBP1, or whether covalent modifications to IAV RNAs facilitate Z-RNA formation, remains to be seen. Notably, while right-handed RNA (A-RNA) and DNA (B-DNA) duplexes are structurally different from each other—for which reason protein domains that bind to B-DNA do not associate with A-RNA and vice versa —the left-handed Z-form duplexes of RNA and DNA have very similar structures. Indeed, Zα domains can bind both Z-DNA and Z-RNA in vitro ( Brown et al., 2000 4. Brown, 2nd, B.A. ∙ Lowenhaupt, K. ∙ Wilbert, C.M. ... The zalpha domain of the editing enzyme dsRNA adenosine deaminase binds left-handed Z-RNA as well as Z-DNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :13532-13536 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ) raising the intriguing possibility that proteins with Zα domains may represent bifunctional sensors capable of recognizing both Z-RNA and Z-DNA duplexes to initiate host innate-immune responses.
Is replication in the nucleus required for Z-RNA formation or activation of ZBP1? Orthomyxoviruses are almost unique among RNA viruses in that they replicate in the nucleus of the host cell. Other viruses known to activate ZBP1 (e.g., MCMV and HSV-1/2) ( Mocarski et al., 2014; Upton et al., 2017 24. Mocarski, E.S. ∙ Kaiser, W.J. ∙ Livingston-Rosanoff, D. ... True grit: programmed necrosis in antiviral host defense, inflammation, and immunogenicity J. Immunol. 2014; 192 :2019-2026 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Upton, J.W. ∙ Shubina, M. ∙ Balachandran, S. RIPK3-driven cell death during virus infections Immunol. Rev. 2017; 277 :90-101 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) are DNA viruses that also replicate in the nucleus, whereas two cytoplasmic RNA viruses, VSV and EMCV, do not produce detectable Z-RNA or activate ZBP1. Although these results may suggest that nuclear replication is required for production of Z-RNA (or perhaps Z-DNA, in the case of DNA viruses) and/or activation of ZBP1, they do not rule out the existence of scenarios in which Z-RNA formation and ZBP1 activation occurs outside the nucleus. Indeed, multiple lines of evidence support this possibility, including the observations that (1) Z-RNA was first detected in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells ( Zarling et al., 1987 53. Zarling, D.A. ∙ Calhoun, C.J. ∙ Hardin, C.C. ... Cytoplasmic Z-RNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84 :6117-6121 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ); (2) ZBP1 excluded from the nucleus still activates cell death upon IAV infection, albeit with slower kinetics that wild-type ZBP1 ( Figure 4 F); (3) ZBP1 has been implicated in sensing DNA from damaged mitochondria ( Szczesny et al., 2018 43. Szczesny, B. ∙ Marcatti, M. ∙ Ahmad, A. ... Mitochondrial DNA damage and subsequent activation of Z-DNA binding protein 1 links oxidative stress to inflammation in epithelial cells Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :914 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ); (4) the Zα domain-containing proteins ADAR1 and PKZ operate in the cytoplasm ( Rich and Zhang, 2003 34. Rich, A. ∙ Zhang, S. Timeline: Z-DNA: the long road to biological function Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4 :566-572 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar ), where they limit the replication of cytoplasmic RNA viruses such as measles virus (ADAR1) or inhibit mRNA translation (PKZ); and (5) poxviruses replicate in the cytoplasm, but encode Zα domain containing proteins (e.g., Vaccinia virus E3L).
Once activated in the nucleus, ZBP1 initiates “inside-out” (i.e., nucleus-to-cytoplasm) cell death signaling in response to IAV. Shortly after activation of ZBP1, approximately one-third of infected cells display gross MLKL-dependent nuclear abnormalities, including rupture of the nuclear envelope and DNA herniation into the cytosol. These events are also seen when MLKL is artificially activated in the nucleoplasm, demonstrating that MLKL can directly impinge on the nuclear membrane to induce its rupture. This finding, while unanticipated, is not surprising, as the inner and outer nuclear membranes both contain phospholipids previously shown to mediate MLKL recruitment to the plasma membrane during conventional necroptosis. The mechanism by which active MLKL exits the nucleus and mediates nuclear membrane is currently unclear, although our results from use of the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B suggest that a significant proportion of MLKL nuclear egress is controlled by conventional nuclear pore-dependent mechanisms. Notably, leptomycin B-treated cells display distorted nuclear morphology but manifest significantly less evidence of nuclear envelope rupture, suggesting that cytosolic MLKL is a significant contributor to nuclear membrane damage during IAV-induced necroptosis. It will be interesting to determine if breaching of the nuclear envelope is also controlled from the nucleoplasmic side, and if MLKL can exit the nucleus from these breaches. It is also unclear why only some IAV-infected cells show evidence of nuclear envelope rupture, while others do not. Speculatively, ESCRT III-driven membrane repair mechanisms, shown to operate during MLKL-mediated plasma membrane lysis ( Gong et al., 2017 9. Gong, Y.N. ∙ Guy, C. ∙ Olauson, H. ... ESCRT-III Acts Downstream of MLKL to Regulate Necroptotic Cell Death and Its Consequences Cell. 2017; 169 :286-300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (467) PubMed Google Scholar ), and known to maintain nuclear integrity in other contexts ( Isermann and Lammerding, 2017; Vietri et al., 2016 12. Isermann, P. ∙ Lammerding, J. Consequences of a tight squeeze: Nuclear envelope rupture and repair Nucleus. 2017; 8 :268-274 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar 46. Vietri, M. ∙ Stenmark, H. ∙ Campsteijn, C. Closing a gap in the nuclear envelope Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 40 :90-97 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), may protect nuclei in the IAV-infected cells that display morphologically intact nuclear envelopes. Intriguingly, phosphorylated MLKL in also observed the nucleus during TNF-α-initiated necroptosis ( Weber et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2016 48. Weber, K. ∙ Roelandt, R. ∙ Bruggeman, I. ... Nuclear RIPK3 and MLKL contribute to cytosolic necrosome formation and necroptosis Commun. Biol. 2018; 1 :6 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Yoon, S. ∙ Bogdanov, K. ∙ Kovalenko, A. ... Necroptosis is preceded by nuclear translocation of the signaling proteins that induce it Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23 :253-260 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), but in these cells, the nuclear envelope, while distorted, is rarely breached, and DNA leakage into the cytosol is not typically seen. We note, however, that HMGB1 can rapidly exit the nuclei of cells undergoing TNF-α-stimulated necroptosis ( Murai et al., 2018 25. Murai, S. ∙ Yamaguchi, Y. ∙ Shirasaki, Y. ... A FRET biosensor for necroptosis uncovers two different modes of the release of DAMPs Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4457 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that widespread nuclear envelope damage may not be required for HMGB1 release from necroptotic nuclei. In these cells, the subset of MLKL that transits through the nucleus ( Weber et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2016 48. Weber, K. ∙ Roelandt, R. ∙ Bruggeman, I. ... Nuclear RIPK3 and MLKL contribute to cytosolic necrosome formation and necroptosis Commun. Biol. 2018; 1 :6 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Yoon, S. ∙ Bogdanov, K. ∙ Kovalenko, A. ... Necroptosis is preceded by nuclear translocation of the signaling proteins that induce it Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23 :253-260 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ) may promote release of HMGB1 and other nuclear DAMPs without triggering extensive nuclear envelope damage.
Programmed cell death is an effective mechanism of IAV clearance that not only eliminates infected cells to limit virus spread but also serves to catalyze adaptive immune responses. However, when cell death is unrestrained ( Sanders et al., 2013 41. Sanders, C.J. ∙ Vogel, P. ∙ McClaren, J.L. ... Compromised respiratory function in lethal influenza infection is characterized by the depletion of type I alveolar epithelial cells beyond threshold levels Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2013; 304 :L481-L488 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), or when the mode of cell death is primarily necrotic ( Rodrigue-Gervais et al., 2014 35.

Such severe pathology is observed in mouse models, in which destruction of airway epithelia is a common during lethal IAV infection ( Brandes et al., 2013; Kash et al., 2006; Sanders et al., 2011, 2013 3.

Korteweg, C. ∙ Gu, J. Pathology, molecular biology, and pathogenesis of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans Am. J.

Lung pathology in fatal novel human influenza A (H1N1) infection Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2010; 181 :72-79 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, necroptotic cell debris is potently immunogenic ( Yatim et al., 2017 51. Yatim, N. ∙ Cullen, S. ∙ Albert, M.L. Dying cells actively regulate adaptive immune responses Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :262-275 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ) and can contribute to neutrophil recruitment and activation. Because neutrophils have been shown to trigger a pathogenic feed-forward inflammatory response during lethal IAV infections ( Brandes et al., 2013; Narasaraju et al., 2011 3. Brandes, M. ∙ Klauschen, F. ∙ Kuchen, S. ...

Pathol. 2011; 179 :199-210 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (697) PubMed Google Scholar ), and because the nucleus contains numerous DAMPs, including DNA itself, which are capable of provoking deleterious inflammatory responses when released from ruptured nuclei ( Roh and Sohn, 2018 37. Roh, J.S. ∙ Sohn, D.H. Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns in Inflammatory Diseases Immune Netw. 2018; 18 :e27 Crossref Scopus (710) PubMed Google Scholar ), our data implicate MLKL-mediated nuclear rupture and necroptosis as a driver of IAV virulence. Given that necroptosis is largely dispensable for virus clearance as long as RIPK3-induced apoptosis ( Nogusa et al., 2016 30. Nogusa, S. ∙ Thapa, R.J. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ...

All mice were bred and maintained in specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities at the Fox Chase Cancer Center and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. For all in vivo experiments, mice were separated into experimental groups on the basis of genotype at 10-12 weeks of age. Mixed cohorts of female and male mice were used for all experiments to exclude gender effects. All animal procedures were performed according to the protocols approved by the Committee on Use and Care of Animals at these institutions.
LET1 AECs were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1x GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and have been described before ( Rosenberger et al., 2014 38. Rosenberger, C.M. ∙ Podyminogin, R.L. ∙ Askovich, P.S. ... Characterization of innate responses to influenza virus infection in a novel lung type I epithelial cell model J. Gen. Virol. 2014; 95 :350-362 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). A549 and HT-29 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). A549 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1x GlutaMAX, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HT-29 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1x GlutaMAX, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Primary MEFs were generated in-house from E14.5 embryos and used within five passages in experiments. MEFs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1x GlutaMAX, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . A549 and HT-29 cells are human cell lines of male and female origin, respectively. The sex of embryos was not determined before generation of primary MEF cultures.
All IAV and IBV strains were propagated by allantoic inoculation of embryonated hen’s eggs with diluted (1:10 6 ) seed virus. IAV PR8 LD and HD stocks were prepared as previously described ( Xue et al., 2016 50. Xue, J. ∙ Chambers, B.S. ∙ Hensley, S.E. ... Propagation and Characterization of Influenza Virus Stocks That Lack High Levels of Defective Viral Genomes and Hemagglutinin Mutations Front. Microbiol. 2016; 7 :326 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Virus titers were determined as 50% egg infectious dose (EID 50 ) and by plaque assay on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. VSV (Indiana strain) and EMCV were obtained from the ATCC.
ZBP1-Cyto and ZBP1-Nuc were produced by inserting three tandem copies of the nuclear export sequence LELLEDLTL (ZBP1-Cyto), or two tandem copies of the c-Myc-derived nuclear localization sequence PAAKRVKLD (ZBP1-Nuc), between the FLAG tag and the N terminus of ZBP1. Other ZBP1 mutants have been described before ( Thapa et al., 2016 44. Thapa, R.J. ∙ Ingram, J.P. ∙ Ragan, K.B. ... DAI Senses Influenza A Virus Genomic RNA and Activates RIPK3-Dependent Cell Death Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :674-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). FLAG-ZBP1 constructs were cloned into the pQCXIH retroviral expression vector and retroviruses pseudotyped with VSV glycoprotein were produced in 293T cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Retro-X System, Clontech). Retrovirus containing supernatants from these cells were collected 48 hr post-transfection, and used to transduce immortalized Zbp1 −/− MEFs. Cell populations stably expressing FLAG-ZBP1 constructs were obtained by selection in hygromycin. Immortalized Mlkl −/− cells inducibly expressing MLKL or 2xFv-tagged MLKL mutants were produced using the retroviral Tet-On 3G System, as described before ( Quarato et al., 2016 33. Quarato, G. ∙ Guy, C.S. ∙ Grace, C.R. ... Sequential Engagement of Distinct MLKL Phosphatidylinositol-Binding Sites Executes Necroptosis Mol. Cell. 2016; 61 :589-601 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). MLKL-Cyto (MLKL NBB 140 -2xFv-Venus) has been described earlier ( Quarato et al., 2016 33. Quarato, G. ∙ Guy, C.S. ∙ Grace, C.R. ... Sequential Engagement of Distinct MLKL Phosphatidylinositol-Binding Sites Executes Necroptosis Mol. Cell. 2016; 61 :589-601 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). MLKL-Nuc was generated by affixing two tandem copies of the SV40 Large T Ag-derived nuclear localization sequence PKKKRKV to the C terminus of MLKL NBB 140 -2xFv-Venus.
Cells were plated on 8-well glass slides (EMD Millipore), and allowed to adhere for at least 24 hr before use in experiments. Following treatment or virus infection, cells were fixed in freshly-prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, blocked with MAXblock Blocking Medium (Active Motif), and incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C. After three washes in PBS, slides were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Following an additional three washes in PBS, slides were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged by confocal microscopy on a Leica SP8 instrument. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using Leica LAS X software. In some cases (such as for detection of Z-RNA and A-RNA in virus-infected cells), cells were subjected to proteinase K treatment (0.008 U/mL) for 20-40 min at 37°C post-fixation. When required, RNase A (1mg/mL), RNase III (50 U/mL) or DNase I (25 U/mL) was used for 1 hr at 37°C after proteinase K treatment. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions for immuno-fluoresecence studies: MPO (1:500), Cit-H3 (1:500), phosphorylated murine MLKL (1:7000), phosphorylated human MLKL (1:500), IAV NP (1:1000), Z-NA (polyclonal Ab 1:200; monoclonal Ab 1:200), A-RNA (1:50), B-DNA (1:500), FLAG (1:1000), lamin B1 (1:1000), emerin (1:1000), total MLKL (1:500), Venus (1:500), cleaved caspase 3 (1:500).
Immortalized Zbp1 −/− stably reconstituted with FLAG-ZBP1 were infected with IAV, scraped into PBS, washed three times in PBS, and placed in fractionation buffer (10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) on ice for 10 min. Cells were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 5 min. Supernatants (i.e., the cytoplasmic extracts) were decanted and nuclear pellets were washed five times in fractionation buffer. Nuclear extracts were prepared by lysis of these pellets in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, 300mM Sucrose, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts obtained in this manner were incubated with anti-FLAG agarose bead slurry (Sigma) with rotation overnight at 4°C. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, were washed five times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% NP40), resuspended in DNase digestion buffer containing DNase I (50 U/mL) and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. Beads were sedimented by centrifugation, washed once with wash buffer, and resuspended in wash buffer. 5%–10% of each sample was saved for immunoblot analysis to confirm purity of fractions. Samples were then treated with proteinase K at 55°C for 30 min. Tri-reagent (Sigma) was added to each sample, and RNA was harvested according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For PCR detection, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and universal IAV genomic vRNA primers. PCR was then performed for detecting PA-derived DVGs, using the following primers: (Fwd) 5′- TATTCGTCTCAGGGAGCGAAAGCAGGTAC −3′; (Rev) 5′- ATATCGTCTCGTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGTACTT-3′. For RNA-Seq analysis, nucleic acid eluted from nuclear FLAG-ZBP1 immunoprecipitates was used as template for PCR with a set of semi-degenerate primers designed to target the ends of the PA segment. After 25 rounds of PCR, the product was separated by gel electrophoresis, and the visible band at approximately 300–500 bp was excised and purified. The size-selected template was subsequently prepared for library preparation (HyperPrep Kit, Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (250 bp paired-end sequencing). Adapters and low-quality bases were removed from the resulting reads using Trim Galore (Babraham Bioinformatics), and reads were then mapped to the full PR8 Influenza genome using Bowtie2 local alignment. To exclude off-target PCR products, improperly paired reads and pairs with a mapping-inferred insert size less than 600 bp were filtered prior to visualization. Properly paired reads mapping to the PA segment with an inferred insert size greater than 600 bp were visualized using the R Sushi package.
Immortalized Zbp1 −/− MEFs stably reconstituted with FLAG-tagged WT or mutant ZBP1 were lysed in IP lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat#87787) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat#78444). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min, and briefly sonicated to shear chromatin, then cleared by high speed centrifugation (20,000 g , 10 min) at 4°C. After saving 5% of the total cell lysate for input, the extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma, cat#FLAGIPT1). Resin was eluted with 3xFLAG peptide and the supernatants subjected to immunoblot analysis as described before ( Chen et al., 2013 6. Chen, P. ∙ Nogusa, S. ∙ Thapa, R.J. ... Anti-CD70 immunocytokines for exploitation of interferon-γ-induced RIP1-dependent necrosis in renal cell carcinoma PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e61446 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: IAV HA (1:3000), IAV PB1 (1:2000), IAV NP (1:2000), IAV NS1 (1:4000), phosphorylated murine MLKL (1:2000), phosphorylated human MLKL (1:1000), total MLKL (1:2000), ZBP1 (1:2000), RIPK3 (1:2000), FLAG (1:2000), Histone H3 (1:4000), HMGB1 (1:2000), GAPDH (1:4000) and β-actin (1:2000).
Formaldehyde crosslinked immunoprecipitation (fRIP) was performed as previously described ( Zhao et al., 2018 55. Zhao, Y. ∙ Ye, X. ∙ Dunker, W. ... RIG-I like receptor sensing of host RNAs facilitates the cell-intrinsic immune response to KSHV infection Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4841 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, immortalized Zbp1 −/− MEFs stably reconstituted with FLAG-tagged WT or mutant (ΔZα) ZBP1 were infected with IAV and separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 5 min in fractionation buffer (10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). Isolated nuclei were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in PBS with slow rotation at room temperature for 10 min, and unreacted formaldehyde was neutralized with 0.3 M glycine for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in RIPA buffer on ice for 10 min. Soluble cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma). Resin was eluted with 3xFLAG peptide and protein-RNA crosslinks were reversed by incubation in buffer containing 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 2 mM DTT at 70°C for 45 min. RNA was recovered in TRIzol and extracted in phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [25:24:1 (vol/vol)] followed by ethanol precipitation. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Standard PCR and qPCR were performed to detect PA DVGs using the Platinum SuperFi PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and SYBR green (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively, using the following primers: Standard PCR PA-(Fwd) 5′- GATGATTGTCGAGCTTGCGG −3′; PA-(Rev) 5′- TCCCAGGTTCAAGGTTGTCC −3′; qPCR PA-(Fwd) 5′- GCTTCTTATCGTTCAGGCTCTT −3′; PA-(Rev) 5′- GGGATCATTAATCAGGCACTCC −3′
Models of CG-repeat dsRNA 12-mers containing unmodified guanosine or m 8 Gm guanosine analogs were generated using BIOVIA Discovery Studio 4.5 software, and molecular dynamics simulations performed by employing the Standard Dynamics Cascade protocol in the same software. The five best conformations generated by these simulations were then energy minimized, and the conformation with the lowest energy was selected for display.
Bone marrow from femurs and tibias of 8-week old C57BL/6J mice was isolated and cells pelleted in sterile Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ -free HBSS containing penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were then resuspended in ACK (Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium) Lysing Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for the lysis of red blood cells and washed twice with 1xHBSS. Neutrophils were separated from mononuclear cells by layering 2 mL of the cell suspension onto 3 mL of an 81% Percoll cushion (GE Healthcare). The cell suspension was then overlaid with 3 mL of 62% Percoll, followed by centrifugation at 2,500 g for 20 min at 4°C. The middle layer enriched for neutrophils was washed twice in 1xHBSS, and cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM. Isolated neutrophils were transferred into 8-well glass slides containing 200 μL of serum-free DMEM and activated by co-culturing with an equal volume of supernatant from treated/infected cells for 24 hr. Cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence staining.
FAM-labeled RNAs (1 μM) and antibodies (10 μM) were incubated in EMSA binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/mL BSA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were then separated by non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1xTBE (Tris/borate/EDTA) buffer containing 20 mM NaCl at 80 V and 4°C for 2 hr. The gel was imaged on a phosphorimager (LAS-3000, Fujifilm).
5x10 6 MLKL-Cyto and MLKL-Nuc MEFs were cultured in 60 mm cell culture dishes in 1.5 mL DMEM/10% FBS per dish. Following exposure to oligomerizer, supernatants were collected and subjected to ELISA per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Age- (8-12 week old) and sex-matched mice were anesthetized with Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol) or 3% isoflurane and infected intranasally with virus (PR8) inoculum diluted in endotoxin-free saline. Mice were either monitored for survival over a period of 21 days or sacrificed at defined time points for analysis of histology and virus replication. Mice losing > 30% body weight were considered moribund and euthanized by gradual CO 2 asphyxiation. Titration of virus was conducted by standard plaque assay of diluted lung homogenates on monolayers of MDCK cells, and plaques were scored after three days of incubation. To assess IAV-specific CD8 + T cells, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on infected mice, and cells in BAL fluid were pelleted by centrifuging at 500 g for 5 min. 1x10 5 BAL cells were plated for each condition, and cells were stimulated in complete RPMI for 4 hr at 37°C with 1 μM of each of the virus-specific peptides in the presence of brefeldin A and monesin. The following virus-specific peptides were used for stimulation: PB1 703 – 711 , PA 224 – 233 , and NP 366 – 374 . Following stimulation, cells were washed and then blocked using TruStain FcX block (1:100) (Biolegend). Cell surface staining was then performed for 30 min at room temperature using the following antibodies/dyes and dilutions: Ghost Violet 510 Viability Dye (1:100), anti-mouse CD45-APC/Fire 750 (1:100), anti-mouse CD3-PE (1:100), anti-mouse CD8a-APC (1:200), and anti-mouse CD4-FITC (1:200). Cells were then washed, fixed, and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Pharmigen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were stained with anti-mouse IFN-γ-PE/Cy7 (1:100) and anti-mouse TNFα-BV785 (1:100) for 30 min on ice and then analyzed on an LSRII Fortessa machine (BD Biosciences).
Curve fitting and statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 software, using either unpaired Student’s t test for comparison between two groups or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for comparisons between multiple (> 2) groups. Significance of in vivo survival data was determined by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Information on replicates, sample size (e.g., number of animals per group), precision measures (mean ± SD), statistical methods and significance are indicated in Figure Legends.
RNA-sequencing data of FLAG-ZBP1 immunoprecipitates in Figure 2 were deposited in BioProject: PRJNA603378. All data produced by this study are included in the manuscript or available from the corresponding author on request.
