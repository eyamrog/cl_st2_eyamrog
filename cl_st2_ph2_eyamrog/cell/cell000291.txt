Title: A basophil-neuronal axis promotes itch


Abstract: Summary

Itch is an evolutionarily conserved sensation that facilitates expulsion of pathogens and noxious stimuli from the skin. However, in organ failure, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD), itch becomes chronic, intractable, and debilitating. In addition to chronic itch, patients often experience intense acute itch exacerbations. Recent discoveries have unearthed the neuroimmune circuitry of itch, leading to the development of anti-itch treatments. However, mechanisms underlying acute itch exacerbations remain overlooked. Herein, we identify that a large proportion of patients with AD harbor allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and exhibit a propensity for acute itch flares. In mice, while allergen-provoked acute itch is mediated by the mast cell-histamine axis in steady state, AD-associated inflammation renders this pathway dispensable. Instead, a previously unrecognized basophil-leukotriene (LT) axis emerges as critical for acute itch flares. By probing fundamental itch mechanisms, our study highlights a basophil-neuronal circuit that may underlie a variety of neuroimmune processes.

Section: Introduction

Itch (i.e., pruritus) is defined as an uncomfortable sensation on the skin that causes a desire to scratch. When acute, itch is a protective mechanism to rapidly expel noxious environmental stimuli. However, itch can become chronic and pathologic in nature, underlying a variety of medical conditions that range from inflammatory skin disorders to chronic kidney disease and cancer ( Larson et al., 2019 59.

Chronic itch is clinically defined in humans as itch that lasts for greater than 6 weeks ( Kim et al., 2019 53. Kim, B.S. ∙ Berger, T.G. ∙ Yosipovitch, G.

Notably, chronic itch often persists for years due to the lack of effective therapeutics and can profoundly affect quality of life of patients ( Altınok Ersoy and Akyar, 2019 2.

In recent years, the morbidity of chronic itch has been increasingly recognized and clinical trials now routinely measure itch as a key endpoint ( Fishbane et al., 2020 26.

However, current assessments quantify itch severity as an aggregate score over time ( Erickson and Kim, 2019 22. Erickson, S. ∙ Kim, B.S. Research Techniques Made Simple: Itch Measurement in Clinical Trials J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :264-269.e1 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), despite the fact that patients with chronic itch often experience acute itch flares, i.e., rapid and intense exacerbations of itch ( Fourzali et al., 2020 29.

This results in studies failing to assess the dynamic nature of itch in chronic conditions.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a pruritic inflammatory skin disease with a chronic but relapsing course. Although chronic itch is a well-defined feature of AD, patients also report experiencing sudden itch flares, which remain poorly characterized ( Chang et al., 2016 13.

Birch pollen-related foods can cause late eczematous reactions in patients with atopic dermatitis Allergy. 2018; 73 :2046-2054 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent advances in neuroimmunology have demonstrated that effector cytokines associated with AD such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13, and IL-31 can directly stimulate sensory neurons to promote chronic itch ( Cevikbas et al., 2014 12. Cevikbas, F. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Akiyama, T. ... A sensory neuron-expressed IL-31 receptor mediates T helper cell-dependent itch: Involvement of TRPV1 and TRPA1 J. Allergy Clin.

Whether acute itch flares simply represent enhanced signaling of these known pathways or use other molecular circuits remains unknown.
Characterized by scaly, leaky, and oozing skin, patients with AD become epicutaneously sensitized to environmental allergens and thus harbor allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) ( Spergel and Paller, 2003 91.

Although the acquisition of allergen-specific IgE predisposes patients with AD to develop other atopic disorders such as asthma and food allergy ( Brough et al., 2015 9.

Ogawa, Y. ∙ Kono, M. ∙ Tsujikawa, M. ... IgE-independent pathophysiology of severe atopic dermatitis demonstrated in an IgE-deficient patient J. Dermatol. Sci. 2016; 82 :139-141 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even in murine models of AD that are induced by model allergens, cutaneous inflammation occurs independently of IgE ( Spergel et al., 1999 92. Spergel, J.M. ∙ Mizoguchi, E. ∙ Oettgen, H. ... Roles of TH1 and TH2 cytokines in a murine model of allergic dermatitis J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103 :1103-1111 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, anti-IgE therapy has produced mixed results and has not advanced beyond phase 2 clinical trials in human AD, for which trial endpoints are primarily focused on skin inflammation and not itch ( Deleanu and Nedelea, 2019 17.

Kim, M. ∙ Kim, Y.M. ∙ Lee, J.Y. ...

Therefore, we hypothesized that IgE may represent a key mechanism that drives acute itch flares in response to allergens in the context of AD.

Protective and pathological roles of mast cells and basophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :362-375 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). The most well-studied mechanism of mast cell activation is IgE-mediated degranulation. Allergen recognition by IgE bound to the high-affinity receptor FcεRI results in IgE crosslinking and triggers the release of a variety of effector molecules such as histamine and serotonin ( Benditt et al., 1955 4.

Ishizaka, K. ∙ Tomioka, H. ∙ Ishizaka, T. Mechanisms of passive sensitization. I. Presence of IgE and IgG molecules on human leukocytes J. Immunol. 1970; 105 :1459-1467 PubMed Google Scholar ). These mediators in turn can activate sensory neurons to provoke neuroinflammation and itch sensation ( Wang et al., 2020 109. Wang, F. ∙ Yang, T.B. ∙ Kim, B.S. The Return of the Mast Cell: New Roles in Neuroimmune Itch Biology J. Invest. Dermatol. 2020; 140 :945-951 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, histamine was one of the first factors identified to elicit itch through its direct stimulation of sensory neurons (i.e., to act as a pruritogen), and it is now recognized as a canonical mediator of acute itch ( Dale and Laidlaw, 1910 16. Dale, H.H. ∙ Laidlaw, P.P. The physiological action of beta-iminazolylethylamine J. Physiol. 1910; 41 :318-344 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Weisshaar et al., 1997 114.

He, A. ∙ Feldman, S.R. ∙ Fleischer, Jr., A.B. An assessment of the use of antihistamines in the management of atopic dermatitis J. Am. Acad.

In the current study, we examined clinical itch datasets from phase 3 clinical trials for moderate-to-severe AD and found that a large proportion of patients exhibit acute itch flares that would not be captured in traditional analyses. Furthermore, we identified that patients with allergen-specific IgE have a higher likelihood of exhibiting acute itch flares than those without allergen-specific IgE, provoking the hypothesis that allergen exposure is a factor that drives acute itch flares. To investigate this, we generated a murine model of AD-like disease in which challenge with a model allergen elicits acute itch flares. Although dependent on IgE, acute itch flares surprisingly occurred independently of tissue-resident mast cells, but they were critically dependent on basophils. Strikingly, chemogenetic activation of basophils alone was sufficient to provoke itch-induced scratching behavior in mice. Intravital imaging further demonstrated basophil-sensory neuron interactions following cutaneous allergen exposure. Moreover, allergen-stimulated basophils exhibited enhanced production of leukotriene (LT) C4. The presence of cysteinyl LT receptor 2 (CysLTR2) on neurons, a receptor for LTC4, was critically required for acute itch flares in AD-associated inflammation. Collectively, our study unveils a form of acute itch flare that emerges in the context of chronic skin inflammation to activate a non-canonical basophil-neuronal circuit. Importantly, we highlight how itch manifests heterogeneously even within one disease.

Although patients suffering from chronic itch can experience acute periods of intense itch exacerbation ( Fourzali et al., 2020 29. Fourzali, K.M. ∙ Golpanian, R.S. ∙ Chan, Y.H. ...

Dermatol. 2006; 142 :1190-1196 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), this phenomenon remains poorly characterized. To study AD-associated acute itch flares, we performed a post hoc analysis on two phase 3 clinical trials for moderate-to-severe AD ( Simpson et al., 2016 88. Simpson, E.L. ∙ Bieber, T. ∙ Guttman-Yassky, E. ..., SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 Investigators Two Phase 3 Trials of Dupilumab versus Placebo in Atopic Dermatitis N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375 :2335-2348 Crossref Scopus (675) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assessed the daily numerical rating scale (NRS) itch scores from placebo-treated patients (N = 159) over a 2-month period ( Figure 1 A). The NRS itch score is a single-item self-assessment wherein patients rate their severity of itch from 0 (“no itch”) to 10 (“worst imaginable itch”) over the prior 24 h ( Phan et al., 2012 80. Phan, N.Q. ∙ Blome, C. ∙ Fritz, F. ... Assessment of pruritus intensity: prospective study on validity and reliability of the visual analogue scale, numerical rating scale and verbal rating scale in 471 patients with chronic pruritus Acta Derm. Venereol. 2012; 92 :502-507 Crossref Scopus (260) PubMed Google Scholar ). While some patients exhibited consistent itch severity over the assessment period, others exhibited a fluctuating itch pattern with rapid and frequent spikes of itch ( Figure 1 B). We classified patients as having an acute itch flare if there was an elevation in their daily NRS itch score of ≥2 points relative to their baseline (day 0) within a 3-day period ( Langan et al., 2006 58. Langan, S.M. ∙ Thomas, K.S. ∙ Williams, H.C. What is meant by a “flare” in atopic dermatitis? A systematic review and proposal Arch. Dermatol. 2006; 142 :1190-1196 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the first month, 26.4% of the patients (42/159) exhibited acute itch flares ( Figure 1 C). In the second month, interestingly, N = 5 patients (5/159, 3.1%) lost their acute itch phenotype, while N = 32 patients (32/159, 20.1%), who previously exhibited a non-flare pattern, developed acute itch flares ( Figure 1 D). Overall, 46.5% of patients with AD (74/159) presented with acute itch flares during the course of the 2-month period ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Collectively, our data demonstrate that acute itch flares are exhibited by a large proportion of patients with AD. However, what factors drive these periodic itch exacerbations remain unclear.
Prior studies have found that allergens provoke itch in AD ( Jaworek et al., 2020 46. Jaworek, A.K. ∙ Szafraniec, K. ∙ Jaworek, M. ...

Exacerbation of atopic dermatitis on grass pollen exposure in an environmental challenge chamber J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2015; 136 :96-103.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the majority of patients with AD harbor allergen-specific IgE ( Flohr et al., 2004 27. Flohr, C. ∙ Johansson, S.G. ∙ Wahlgren, C.F. ... How atopic is atopic dermatitis? J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2004; 114 :150-158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate whether reactivity to allergens is linked to acute itch flares, we retrospectively profiled the serum allergen-specific IgE repertoire from our cohort of N = 159 patients ( Figure 1 A). We separated patients into those who harbor allergen-specific IgE (N = 133 patients, 83.6%) and those who do not (N = 26 patients, 16.4%). Strikingly, a higher frequency of patients with allergen-specific IgE (68/133, 51.1%) experienced acute itch flares than those without allergen-specific IgE (6/26, 23.1%) ( Figure 1 E). Taken together, these findings indicate that the presence of allergen-specific IgE is likely associated with acute itch flares in AD, provoking the hypothesis that allergen exposure might be a factor that drives acute itch flares.
To test whether allergen recognition by IgE promotes acute itch flares in the setting of AD-associated inflammation, we generated a murine model of acute itch flares. We induced AD-like disease by topically treating mice on both ears with the irritant calcipotriol (MC903) daily for 10 days. Concurrently with MC903, the model allergen ovalbumin (OVA) was also topically applied onto the ear skin in order to mirror epicutaneous allergen sensitization ( Figures 1 F and S1 A) that occurs in patients ( Han et al., 2017 34.

After 10 days, MC903 + OVA-treated wild-type (WT) mice developed robust AD-like skin inflammation ( Figures S1 B and S1C), allergen (OVA)-specific IgE ( Figure 1 G), and chronic spontaneous itch (∼60 bouts/10 min) ( Figure 1 H, blue line, open and closed squares). This was in contrast to WT mice that received the control treatment of ethanol vehicle and OVA (EtOH + OVA), which lacked skin inflammation ( Figures S1 B and S1C), OVA-specific IgE ( Figure 1 G), and chronic spontaneous itch behavior (∼5 bouts/10 min) over the same interval ( Figure 1 H, blue line, open circle). Upon intradermal (i.d.) injection of OVA into the adjacent non-lesional cheek skin of mice with AD-associated inflammation ( Figure 1 F), an acute itch flare was immediately observed (∼200 bouts/10 min) and resolved over the subsequent 30 min ( Figure 1 H, red line, closed square). However, this acute itch flare phenomenon was absent in EtOH + OVA-treated control mice i.d. challenged with OVA ( Figure 1 H, red line, open circle) and in mice with AD-associated inflammation that were i.d. challenged with an irrelevant allergen, bovine serum albumin (BSA) ( Figure 1 H, red line, open square). As expected, IgE was required for acute itch flares as IgE-deficient ( Ige −/− ) mice failed to generate a response to i.d. OVA challenge, while IgE was dispensable for chronic spontaneous itch ( Figure 1 I). These studies demonstrate that acute itch flares triggered by allergen exposure are dependent on IgE in the context of AD.
Mast cell degranulation induced by IgE crosslinking is well known to trigger acute itch sensation ( Gould and Sutton, 2008 31. Gould, H.J. ∙ Sutton, B.J. IgE in allergy and asthma today Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8 :205-217 Crossref Scopus (707) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meixiong et al., 2019 71. Meixiong, J. ∙ Anderson, M. ∙ Limjunyawong, N. ...

Indeed, when naive WT were passively sensitized by intravenous (i.v.) transfer of exogenous anti-OVA IgE and then challenged with i.d. OVA ( Figure S1 D), they experienced robust acute itch ( Figure S1 E) that was dependent on both mast cells ( Figure S1 F) and histamine ( Figure S1 G). Surprisingly, however, in our AD-associated acute itch flare model, both chronic spontaneous itch and acute itch flares were not significantly different between mast cell-deficient Sash −/− and littermate control mice ( Figure 1 J). To corroborate these observations using an alternative method of sensitization, we transferred anti-OVA IgE into MC903-treated WT mice or mast cell-deficient Sash −/− mice and subsequently challenged them with i.d. OVA to elicit acute itch flares ( Figures S1 H and S1I). Again, Sash −/− mice had comparable acute itch flares to their littermate controls in this setting ( Figure S1 J). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that allergen-provoked acute itch, while mast cell-dependent and histaminergic in the steady state, occurs independently of mast cells in the setting of AD-like disease. Thus, it appears that AD-associated inflammation activates an alternative IgE-dependent cellular circuit to evoke acute itch flares. In support of this, cells with a distinctly degranulated morphology as identified by avidin staining ( Bergstresser et al., 1984 7. Bergstresser, P.R. ∙ Tigelaar, R.E. ∙ Tharp, M.D. Conjugated avidin identifies cutaneous rodent and human mast cells J. Invest.

OVA challenge ( Figure 1 K), indicating the presence of an alternative cell type.
Basophils, like tissue-resident mast cells, also express the high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRI and release similar effector molecules such as histamine, serotonin, tryptase, and LTs following IgE crosslinking ( Voehringer, 2013 105. Voehringer, D. Protective and pathological roles of mast cells and basophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :362-375 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite their importance in driving cutaneous inflammation and their functional similarities to mast cells ( Borriello et al., 2014 8. Borriello, F. ∙ Granata, F. ∙ Marone, G.

Basophils play a critical role in the development of IgE-mediated chronic allergic inflammation independently of T cells and mast cells Immunity. 2005; 23 :191-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ), the role of basophils in itch remains unknown. Given that basophils are not skin resident, but rather circulate in the blood and enter the skin upon stimulation, we sought to investigate whether AD-associated inflammation systemically alters basophils.
To test this, we performed flow cytometry on the blood of patients with AD (N = 12) and healthy control subjects (N = 12) ( Figure 2 A; Table S1 ). Strikingly, AD-associated blood basophils, although unchanged in frequency ( Figure 2 B), exhibited elevated expression of the human basophil marker CD203c ( Figure 2 C). Cytokines such as IL-3 upregulate CD203c expression on human basophils and enhance IgE-mediated responses ( Brunner et al., 1993 10. Brunner, T. ∙ Heusser, C.H. ∙ Dahinden, C.A. Human peripheral blood basophils primed by interleukin 3 (IL-3) produce IL-4 in response to immunoglobulin E receptor stimulation J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177 :605-611 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In support of the possibility that AD-associated basophils may be more reactive to IgE stimulation, blood basophils from patients with AD demonstrated significantly enhanced expression of FcεRIα compared with basophils from control subjects ( Figure 2 D). Similarly, mice with AD-like disease ( Figures 2 E and S2 A) did not display differences in the frequency of circulating basophils ( Figure 2 F). Instead, they exhibited rapid and sustained upregulation of the murine basophil activation marker CD200R ( Figures 2 G and S2 B) and FcεRIα compared with control mice ( Figures 2 H and S2 C). These findings provoke the hypothesis that basophils are more responsive to IgE-mediated stimulation, which may enable their ability to promote itch.
We next asked whether direct activation of basophils alone is sufficient to induce acute itch. To test this, we used a chemogenetic approach by crossing the basophil-specific Mcpt8- Cre-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) mouse with the Rosa26-LSL-Gq-DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) line. The resulting Mcpt8 -Gq mice have a targeted insertion of the artificial G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) hM3Dq into basophils, allowing for selective activation upon administration of an otherwise inert compound, clozapine- N -oxide (CNO) ( Figure 3 A). To confirm this, we obtained sort-purified blood basophils from Mctp8 -Gq mice and littermate controls and stimulated them ex vivo with CNO. As expected, basophils from Mctp8 -Gq mice displayed enhanced degranulation compared with littermate controls ( Figures 3 B–3D). We then assessed itch behavior following systemic intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of CNO to Mcpt8 -Gq mice. Strikingly, Mcpt8 -Gq mice exhibited markedly enhanced scratching following CNO injection compared with littermate control mice ( Figure 3 E). These findings demonstrate that basophil activation alone is sufficient to evoke itch behavior.
Next, we tested whether basophils are required to mediate acute itch flares in the context of AD-associated inflammation. We depleted basophils with systemic anti-CD200R3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) administration on day 7 and day 9 of the AD-associated acute itch flare model ( Figure 4 A). Basophil depletion ( Figure 4 B) significantly decreased the acute itch flare response to i.d. OVA challenge ( Figure 4 C). We next used an alternative approach by utilizing Bas-TRECK mice, which exclusively express the diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor on basophils ( Figure 4 D) ( Noti et al., 2013 77. Noti, M. ∙ Wojno, E.D. ∙ Kim, B.S. ... Thymic stromal lymphopoietin-elicited basophil responses promote eosinophilic esophagitis Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1005-1013 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genetic depletion of basophils with i.p. DT administration on day 8 and day 9 of the AD-associated acute itch flare model ( Figure 4 E) resulted in reduced scratching in response to i.d. OVA challenge ( Figure 4 F). Moreover, neither endogenous OVA-specific IgE production nor the underlying chronic spontaneous itch behavior was affected by basophil depletion with either anti-CD200R3 mAb treatment ( Figure S3 A) or in Bas-TRECK mice ( Figure S3 B). Therefore, our data demonstrate that basophils are critically required in promoting acute itch flares in the setting of AD-associated inflammation. Furthermore, to test the specificity of the contribution of basophils to acute itch flares, we used an alternative method of OVA sensitization whereby mice were systemically sensitized by i.p. injection of OVA along with the adjuvant alum ( Figure S3 C) ( Huang et al., 2016 40. Huang, C.C. ∙ Kim, Y.S. ∙ Olson, W.P. ... A histamine-independent itch pathway is required for allergic ocular itch J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 137 :1267-1270.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meixiong et al., 2019 71. Meixiong, J. ∙ Anderson, M. ∙ Limjunyawong, N. ...

In the context of systemic sensitization, acute itch was indeed observed in WT mice following i.d. OVA challenge ( Figure S3 D). However, in this context, acute itch was attenuated in mast cell-deficient Sash −/− mice ( Figure S3 E), but not in basophil-depleted Bas-TRECK mice ( Figure S3 F). Strikingly, upon induction of AD-like disease by MC903 along with systemic sensitization with i.p. OVA + alum ( Figure S3 G), allergen-provoked acute itch flares were unaffected in mast cell-deficient Sash −/− mice ( Figure S3 H) but significantly attenuated in basophil-depleted Bas-TRECK mice ( Figure S3 I). Taken together, these results indicate that the contribution of basophils to acute itch flares arises in the context of AD-like inflammation rather than other forms of sensitization (i.e., OVA + alum).
Mast cells release a number of mediators that directly stimulate sensory neurons to modify sensory behavior ( Voehringer, 2013 105. Voehringer, D. Protective and pathological roles of mast cells and basophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :362-375 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus hypothesized that factors derived from allergen-stimulated basophils are sufficient to provoke acute itch behavior. To test this, we first purified blood basophils from sensitized (MC903 + OVA) and unsensitized (EtOH + OVA) WT mice and stimulated them ex vivo with OVA ( Figure 4 G). We then i.d. injected supernatants into naive WT recipient mice to determine their ability to induce acute itch ( Figure 4 H). Strikingly, basophil-derived factors from sensitized mice induced robust scratching not observed with supernatants from unsensitized mice ( Figure 4 I). We next sought to test whether basophil-derived factors can directly stimulate primary sensory neurons. We isolated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from Pirt GCaMP3/+ calcium reporter mice ( Kim et al., 2014b 51. Kim, Y.S. ∙ Chu, Y. ∙ Han, L. ... Central terminal sensitization of TRPV1 by descending serotonergic facilitation modulates chronic pain Neuron. 2014; 81 :873-887 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tested whether different factors could activate primary sensory neurons by calcium imaging. We first validated that sensory neurons were not responsive to OVA stimulation alone ( Figures S3 J and S3K). We then added basophil-derived supernatants from both unsensitized (EtOH + OVA) and sensitized (MC903 + OVA) WT mice to DRG neurons ( Figure 4 J). Notably, enhanced calcium responses were detected in sensory neurons stimulated with supernatants from allergen-sensitized basophils compared with supernatants from unsensitized basophils ( Figures 4 K and 4L). Additionally, the subpopulation of sensory neurons responsive to basophil-derived factors was also activated by capsaicin ( Figure 4 K), a common feature of many itch-sensory or pruriceptive neurons ( Dong and Dong, 2018 18. Dong, X. ∙ Dong, X. Peripheral and Central Mechanisms of Itch Neuron. 2018; 98 :482-494 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, these findings demonstrate that factors derived from basophils can induce acute itch and activate sensory neurons.
Next, we investigated the specific effector mechanisms by which basophils promote acute itch flares in AD-like disease. The most well-defined pruritogens associated with mast cells include histamine, serotonin, tryptase, and LTs ( Akiyama et al., 2010 1. Akiyama, T. ∙ Carstens, M.I. ∙ Carstens, E.

To determine whether any of these pathways are enriched in basophils, we analyzed publicly available microarray datasets to specifically compare murine blood basophils to skin-resident mast cells ( Benoist et al., 2012 6. Benoist, C. ∙ Lanier, L. ∙ Merad, M. ..., Immunological Genome Project Consortium biology in immunology: the perspective from the Immunological Genome Project Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :734-740 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dwyer et al., 2016 19. Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Barrett, N.A. ∙ Austen, K.F., Immunological Genome Project Consortium Expression profiling of constitutive mast cells reveals a unique identity within the immune system Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :878-887 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). Skin mast cells expressed higher levels of Hdc (histidine decarboxylase, the primary enzyme catalyzing histamine synthesis), Tph1 (tryptophan hydroxylase [TPH] 1, which controls peripheral serotonin synthesis), and Tpsab1 (tryptase) compared with blood basophils ( Figures 5 A–5C). By contrast, blood basophils expressed higher levels of Alox5ap ( Figure 5 D), which encodes arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, also known as 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) ( Mancini et al., 1993 67. Mancini, J.A. ∙ Abramovitz, M. ∙ Cox, M.E. ... 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein is an arachidonate binding protein FEBS Lett. 1993; 318 :277-281 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). LT biosynthesis is critically controlled by the key enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), which requires FLAP for activation ( Hedi and Norbert, 2004 36. Hedi, H. ∙ Norbert, G. 5-Lipoxygenase Pathway, Dendritic Cells, and Adaptive Immunity J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2004; 2004 :99-105 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized that LT biosynthesis is a key pathway underlying acute itch flares. In support of this, antihistamines ( Figure 5 E), an inhibitor of serotonin production ( Figure 5 F), and an antagonist of the tryptase receptor protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) ( Figure 5 G) were all ineffective in attenuating allergen-provoked acute itch flares during AD-associated inflammation. By contrast, pharmacologic inhibition of 5-LOX by zileuton or genetic deficiency of 5-LOX ( Alox5 −/− mice) markedly and significantly reduced acute itch flares ( Figure 5 H). Additionally, disruption of the 5-LOX pathway did not affect the quantity of allergen-specific IgE ( Figure S4 A) or the levels of chronic spontaneous itch ( Figure S4 B). Collectively, these results indicate that LTs may mediate acute itch flares.
We then tested whether LTs released from basophils mediate allergen-provoked acute itch flares. We obtained sort-purified basophils from sensitized (MC903 + OVA) Alox5 −/− or littermate control mice ( Figure 5 I), stimulated them ex vivo with OVA, and then i.d. injected the respective basophil-derived supernatants into naive WT recipient mice. Indeed, supernatants derived from Alox5 −/− basophils did not evoke acute itch behavior like supernatants from littermate control basophils ( Figure 5 J). To exclude the role of LTs released from mast cells, we topically treated mast cell-deficient Sash −/− mice with MC903 + OVA and then gave them an oral gavage of the 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton or vehicle control prior to i.d. OVA challenge ( Figure 5 K). Pharmacologic inhibition of 5-LOX attenuated acute itch flares ( Figure 5 L), indicating that the effect of LT inhibition is independent of mast cells. By contrast, zileuton treatment of basophil-deficient Bas-TRECK mice was not able to additionally suppress acute itch flares ( Figures 5 M and 5N), demonstrating that basophils selectively mediate the induction of acute itch flares via LTs. Taken together, our data implicate basophil-derived LTs as key inducers of allergen-provoked acute itch flares in AD-associated inflammation.
Because of the close proximity of mast cells to nerves in the skin and their capacity to evoke histaminergic itch, the mast cell-nerve unit has classically represented a central neuroimmune axis in itch ( Gupta and Harvima, 2018 32. Gupta, K. ∙ Harvima, I.T. Mast cell-neural interactions contribute to pain and itch Immunol. Rev. 2018; 282 :168-187 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 109.

Having found that factors derived from allergen-activated basophils can directly activate sensory neurons in vitro , we next sought to visualize whether basophils interact with cutaneous sensory neurons in vivo . Although rare in circulation, basophils can rapidly migrate in response to various stimuli such as cytokines and IgE stimulation ( Hirsch and Kalbfleisch, 1980 39. Hirsch, S.R. ∙ Kalbfleisch, J.H.

Wardlaw, A.J. ∙ Walsh, G.M. ∙ Symon, F.A. Mechanisms of eosinophil and basophil migration Allergy. 1994; 49 :797-807 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized that stimulation of basophils with allergen in the skin may result in unique basophil-neuronal interactions that could support their role in itch.
To test this, we used Mcpt8 -Cre-YFP mice in which YFP is specifically expressed on basophils, but not on mast cells ( Sullivan et al., 2011 97. Sullivan, B.M. ∙ Liang, H.E. ∙ Bando, J.K. ... Genetic analysis of basophil function in vivo Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :527-535 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ; Voehringer, 2013 105. Voehringer, D. Protective and pathological roles of mast cells and basophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :362-375 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). We subjected Mcpt8 -Cre-YFP reporter mice to our AD-associated acute itch flare model and performed real-time intravital two-photon imaging to visualize allergen-challenged skin ( Figure 6 A). In unsensitized (EtOH + OVA) control mice, no basophils were observed in the skin before or after i.d. OVA challenge ( Figure 6 B). However, in the skin of sensitized (MC903 + OVA) mice, basophils were detected in the dermis but were primarily non-motile with a round morphology ( Figure 6 B; Video S1 ). Strikingly, after i.d. OVA challenge, the majority of basophils developed an enlarged, elongated morphology and began to crawl through the dermis ( Figure 6 B; Video S2 ). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in the setting of AD-associated inflammation, basophils alter their shape and increase their patrolling behavior in response to allergen challenge.

To examine whether basophils can acquire the ability to interact with sensory neurons in vivo , we generated bone marrow chimeric mice by transferring bone marrow cells from Mcpt8 -Cre-YFP donors into irradiated sensory neuron reporter (Na V 1.8-TdTomato) mice ( Figure 6 C). Intravital two-photon imaging confirmed the presence of round and immotile basophils in the skin of sensitized (MC903 + OVA) chimeric mice prior to allergen challenge ( Figure 6 D; Video S3 ). As observed previously, allergen (OVA) challenge rapidly induced basophil motility with track speeds ranging from 2 to 6 μm/min ( Figure 6 E; Video S4 ) and polarized morphology ( Figure 6 F) consistent with a migratory phenotype ( Rappel and Edelstein-Keshet, 2017 83. Rappel, W.J. ∙ Edelstein-Keshet, L. Mechanisms of Cell Polarization Curr. Opin. Syst. Biol. 2017; 3 :43-53 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, the motile basophils were seen migrating through the dermis and making frequent and extended apparent contacts with sensory nerve fibers ( Figures 6 D, 6G, and 6H; Video S5 ). Taken together, these data demonstrate that basophils are capable of directly interacting with sensory nerve fibers in the skin.

Basophils exhibit frequent interactions with sensory nerve fibers following allergen challenge in the setting of AD-associated acute itch flare, related to Figure 6 Intravital two-photon time-lapse movie of interactions between basophils (green) and sensory nerves fibers (red) following i.d. OVA challenge on day 10 of the AD-associated acute itch flare model in the sensitized (MC903 + OVA) basophil-neuron dual reporter chimeric ( Mcpt8 -Cre × Na V 1.8-TdTomato) mice. Collagen (blue) is imaged by collecting the second harmonic generation signal. Relative time is displayed in min:sec:msec.
Given that basophils interact with sensory neurons and are a significant source of LTs, we sought to investigate the neuronal mechanisms by which LTs promote acute itch flares. Generated from arachidonic acid via the 5-LOX pathway, LTs are a diverse family comprised of LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 ( Luster and Tager, 2004 66. Luster, A.D. ∙ Tager, A.M. T-cell trafficking in asthma: lipid mediators grease the way Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4 :711-724 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schauberger et al., 2016 86.

Allergy Asthma Rep. 2016; 16 :48 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). LTB4 and LTC4 have previously been shown to function as pruritogens in mice ( Andoh and Kuraishi, 1998 3. Andoh, T. ∙ Kuraishi, Y. Intradermal leukotriene B4, but not prostaglandin E2, induces itch-associated responses in mice Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 353 :93-96 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fernandes et al., 2013 25. Fernandes, E.S. ∙ Vong, C.T. ∙ Quek, S. ...

Solinski, H.J. ∙ Kriegbaum, M.C. ∙ Tseng, P.Y. ... Nppb Neurons Are Sensors of Mast Cell-Induced Itch Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :3561-3573.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine which LT likely mediates allergen-provoked acute itch flares, we measured serum LTB4 and LTC4 levels in sensitized (MC903 + OVA) WT mice challenged with i.d. OVA or BSA. Strikingly, in contrast to LTB4 ( Figure 7 A), higher levels of LTC4 were detected in mice challenged with i.d. OVA than in mice challenged with i.d. BSA ( Figure 7 B). In addition, when we obtained sort-purified basophils from sensitized (MC903 + OVA) and unsensitized (EtOH + OVA) WT mice and stimulated them ex vivo with OVA, we found elevated LTC4 production from sensitized basophils compared with unsensitized basophils ( Figure 7 C). More importantly, basophil-depleted Bas-TRECK mice exhibited lower serum LTC4 levels than littermate controls following i.d. OVA challenge in the AD-associated acute itch flare model ( Figure 7 D). Collectively, these data suggest that LTC4 upregulation is dependent on basophils and could be a key pruritogen in allergen-evoked acute itch flares.
Because LTC4 can be converted to LTD4 and metabolized, we used a non-metabolizable form of LTC4, N -methyl LTC4 (N-met LTC4) and confirmed that i.d. injection induces robust scratching behavior in naive WT mice ( Figure 7 E). Indeed, dose-response analysis comparing N-met LTC4 to histamine indicates that N-met LTC4 is a more potent pruritogen ( Figure 7 F). LTC4 has two receptors, CysLTR1 and CysLTR2, both of which are broadly expressed in multiple tissues. However, CysLTR2 is also expressed on sensory neurons ( Sasaki and Yokomizo, 2019 85. Sasaki, F. ∙ Yokomizo, T. The leukotriene receptors as therapeutic targets of inflammatory diseases Int. Immunol. 2019; 31 :607-615 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore which sensory neurons may be responsive to LTC4, we mined a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) database of mouse DRG ( Usoskin et al., 2015 102. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three putative clusters of itch-sensory neurons have been codified by transcriptional profiling: non-peptidergic (NP) 1, NP2, and NP3. CysLTR2 is predominantly and selectively expressed by NP3 neurons ( Figure S5 A) ( Solinski et al., 2019 89. Solinski, H.J. ∙ Kriegbaum, M.C. ∙ Tseng, P.Y. ... Nppb Neurons Are Sensors of Mast Cell-Induced Itch Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :3561-3573.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Usoskin et al., 2015 102. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ). By performing calcium imaging, we found that ∼12% of DRG neurons responded to N-met LTC4, which almost exclusively overlapped with serotonin-responsive NP3 neurons, but not β-alanine-responsive NP1 or chloroquine-responsive NP2 neurons ( Figures S5 B and S5C). Therefore, we sought to investigate whether blockade of CysLTR2 signaling could ameliorate acute itch flares in AD-like disease. Indeed, systemic CysLTR2 blockade with the antagonist HAMI3379 ( Figure 7 G) significantly and specifically reduced allergen-provoked itch flares in sensitized (MC903 + OVA) WT mice ( Figures 7 H and S6 A), while systemic disruption of the LTB4 pathway or CysLTR1 pathway had no effect ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Furthermore, we sought to test whether disruption of CysLTR2 on neurons would be sufficient to reduce acute itch flares. We performed small interfering RNA (siRNA) in vivo delivery via intracisternal injection to knockdown the expression of CysLTR2 at the neuronal level ( Figure 7 I) ( Li et al., 2019 62. Li, F. ∙ Yang, W. ∙ Jiang, H. ... TRPV1 activity and substance P release are required for corneal cold nociception Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5678 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2011 64. Liu, X.Y. ∙ Liu, Z.C. ∙ Sun, Y.G. ... Unidirectional cross-activation of GRPR by MOR1D uncouples itch and analgesia induced by opioids Cell. 2011; 147 :447-458 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared with control siRNA, delivery of CysLTR2 siRNA resulted in notable knockdown of CysLTR2 protein as determined by immunofluorescence of sensory trigeminal ganglia ( Figure 7 J). Importantly, siRNA knockdown of CysLTR2 also significantly and selectively inhibited acute itch flares ( Figures 7 K and S6 D). These results indicate that the LTC4-CysLTR2 axis is critical for the pathogenesis of acute itch flares.
The downstream signaling events of CysLTR2 on sensory neurons remain poorly understood. The majority of newly identified itch receptors are GPCRs that depend on various downstream transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels for their function ( Sun and Dong, 2016 99. Sun, S. ∙ Dong, X. Trp channels and itch Semin. Immunopathol. 2016; 38 :293-307 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Veldhuis et al., 2015 103. Veldhuis, N.A. ∙ Poole, D.P. ∙ Grace, M. ... The G protein-coupled receptor-transient receptor potential channel axis: molecular insights for targeting disorders of sensation and inflammation Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67 :36-73 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we hypothesized that CysLTR2, also a GPCR ( Evans, 2002 23. Evans, J.F. Cysteinyl leukotriene receptors Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69 :587-597 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), would require TRP signaling for its function in sensory neurons. Using calcium imaging, we found that the N-met LTC4-responsive neurons almost entirely overlap with neurons that respond to both the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin and the TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) ( Figures 7 L and 7M). However, genetic deletion of Trpv1 or Trpa1 alone was not sufficient to block N-met LTC4-mediated calcium responses ( Figure 7 N). We then used compound Trpv1 and Trpa1 double - deficient mice ( Feng et al., 2017 24. Feng, J. ∙ Yang, P. ∙ Mack, M.R. ... Sensory TRP channels contribute differentially to skin inflammation and persistent itch Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :980 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that dual deletion abolished calcium responses in sensory neurons ( Figure 7 N). These findings mirror our in vivo results that N-met LTC4-induced scratching behavior was unaffected in either Trpv1 −/− or Trpa1 −/− mice compared with their respective littermate controls ( Figures S7 A and S7B). By contrast, Trpv1 −/− Trpa1 −/− mice exhibited significant reduction in itch behavior in response to N-met LTC4 ( Figure 7 O). Similar to N-met LTC4 injection, Trpv1 −/− Trpa1 −/− mice exhibited a reduction in OVA-mediated acute itch flares ( Figure 7 P), while having no effect on the underlying chronic spontaneous itch ( Figure S7 C). Collectively, we demonstrate that acute itch flares in the inflammatory state use the LTC4-CysLTR2 pathway, which can utilize either TRPV1 or TRPA1 to promote itch signaling in sensory neurons.

Section: Discussion

Atopy is defined as a predisposition to allergen hypersensitivity and enhanced IgE production ( Coca and Cooke, 1923 15. Coca, A.F. ∙ Cooke, R.A. On the classification of the phenomena of hypersensitiveness J. Immunol. 1923; 8 :163-182 Google Scholar ; Justiz Vaillant and Jan, 2020 47. Justiz Vaillant, A.A. ∙ Jan, A. Atopy StatPearls Publishing, 2020 Google Scholar ). The family of atopic diseases includes AD, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergy. Despite being a canonical atopic disorder, the role of IgE in AD remains surprisingly unclear. Indeed, clinical trials with anti-IgE mAb (omalizumab) have been met with mixed results in AD ( Deleanu and Nedelea, 2019 17. Deleanu, D. ∙ Nedelea, I. Biological therapies for atopic dermatitis: An update Exp. Ther. Med. 2019; 17 :1061-1067 PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study suggests, however, that IgE is critical not for chronic itch development but for promoting acute itch flares. Thus, the failures of these clinical trials may have been due to an inability to capture the rapid and dynamic changes in itch by routine clinical assessments. Our high-resolution analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data uncovered that a larger proportion of patients with AD exhibit acute itch flares than previously recognized. Furthermore, we found that the presence of allergen-specific IgE in patients with AD may predispose them to the development of acute itch flares. Thus, our findings demonstrate that heterogeneous forms of itch with unique underlying mechanisms can co-exist within one chronic condition.
Basophils have been suggested to induce pruritus due to their expression of a multitude of pruritogens such as histamine and type 2 cytokines ( Steinhoff et al., 2018 96. Steinhoff, M. ∙ Buddenkotte, J. ∙ Lerner, E.A. Role of mast cells and basophils in pruritus Immunol. Rev. 2018; 282 :248-264 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this has remained unstudied. Thus, we undertook a chemogenetic gain-of-function approach to demonstrate that selective activation of basophils alone is sufficient to induce itch in mice. Although basophils critically promote AD-like skin inflammation ( Imai et al., 2019 43. Imai, Y. ∙ Yasuda, K. ∙ Nagai, M. ... IL-33-Induced Atopic Dermatitis-Like Inflammation in Mice Is Mediated by Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells in Concert with Basophils J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :2185-2194.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2014a 50. Kim, B.S. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Siracusa, M.C. ... Basophils promote innate lymphoid cell responses in inflamed skin J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :3717-3725 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Walsh et al., 2019 107. Walsh, C.M. ∙ Hill, R.Z. ∙ Schwendinger-Schreck, J. ... Neutrophils promote CXCR3-dependent itch in the development of atopic dermatitis eLife. 2019; 8 :e48448 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), surprisingly, we found that they do not mediate chronic spontaneous itch. Furthermore, our study reveals that while mast cells and histamine are critical for acute itch in the steady state, basophils and LTC4 mediate acute itch flares in AD-like disease. Thus, our findings provide insight into the long-standing controversy about the role of mast cells and histamine in atopy and unveil a role for basophils in mediating itch.
Although our study shows that both mast cells and basophils can induce itch in response to the same allergen, in the setting of AD-associated inflammation, basophils emerge as the key effector cell. It is well known that cytokines such as IL-3 can prime basophils to become more reactive to IgE stimulation ( Brunner et al., 1993 10. Brunner, T. ∙ Heusser, C.H. ∙ Dahinden, C.A. Human peripheral blood basophils primed by interleukin 3 (IL-3) produce IL-4 in response to immunoglobulin E receptor stimulation J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177 :605-611 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we found that both murine and human basophils upregulate FcεRIα in the setting of AD-associated inflammation. Taken together, these findings suggest that AD-associated inflammation enhances the capacity of basophils to mediate allergen-induced itch. While our current study focused on IgE-dependent itch, we speculate that basophils may use other mechanisms as well to promote itch in other settings. Indeed, in mast cells, two distinct itch-promoting pathways have recently emerged: (1) histaminergic, IgE-dependent itch and (2) non-histaminergic, Mas-related GPCR (Mrgpr) B2-dependent itch ( Meixiong et al., 2019 71. Meixiong, J. ∙ Anderson, M. ∙ Limjunyawong, N. ... Activation of Mast-Cell-Expressed Mas-Related G-Protein-Coupled Receptors Drives Non-histaminergic Itch Immunity. 2019; 50 :1163-1171.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies have shown that the human ortholog of MrgprB2, MRGPRX2, is expressed on human basophils ( Wedi et al., 2020 112. Wedi, B. ∙ Gehring, M. ∙ Kapp, A. The pseudoallergen receptor MRGPRX2 on peripheral blood basophils and eosinophils: Expression and function Allergy. 2020; 75 :2229-2242 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, future studies will be required to understand the precise role of MRGPRs and other GPCRs on basophils and their potential role in itch.
A striking observation in our study was that LTC4 almost exclusively activated a subpopulation of sensory neurons referred to as NP3. Interestingly, the receptor for IL-31 ( Il31ra ) is exclusively expressed on the NP3 population ( Usoskin et al., 2015 102. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ). The first cytokine to be identified as a pruritogen ( Cevikbas et al., 2014 12. Cevikbas, F. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Akiyama, T. ... A sensory neuron-expressed IL-31 receptor mediates T helper cell-dependent itch: Involvement of TRPV1 and TRPA1 J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2014; 133 :448-460 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ), therapies targeting IL-31 pathway such as nemolizumab are rapidly advancing in clinical trials for AD and other chronic itch disorders ( Kabashima et al., 2018 48. Kabashima, K. ∙ Furue, M. ∙ Hanifin, J.M. ... Nemolizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Randomized, phase II, long-term extension study J. Allergy Clin.

Ruzicka, T. ∙ Hanifin, J.M. ∙ Furue, M. ..., XCIMA Study Group Anti-Interleukin-31 Receptor A Antibody for Atopic Dermatitis N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376 :826-835 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ständer et al., 2020 94. Ständer, S. ∙ Yosipovitch, G. ∙ Legat, F.J. ... Trial of Nemolizumab in Moderate-to-Severe Prurigo Nodularis N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :706-716 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies suggest that human basophils may be a cellular source of IL-31 ( Raap et al., 2017 81. Raap, U. ∙ Gehring, M. ∙ Kleiner, S. ... Human basophils are a source of - and are differentially activated by - IL-31 Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2017; 47 :499-508 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether basophil-derived IL-31 may synergize with LTC4 to amplify acute itch flares in AD remains to be determined. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that basophils activate a subpopulation of sensory neurons that is strongly associated with inflammatory itch.
It is widely appreciated that mast cells are tissue resident in nature and mediate a variety of homeostatic neuroimmune processes such as vasoregulation, neuroinflammation, and sensation due to their close proximity with neurons ( Gupta and Harvima, 2018 32. Gupta, K. ∙ Harvima, I.T. Mast cell-neural interactions contribute to pain and itch Immunol. Rev. 2018; 282 :168-187 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Voehringer, 2013 105. Voehringer, D. Protective and pathological roles of mast cells and basophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :362-375 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, basophils are circulating and generally not present in tissues in the steady state. However, under pathologic conditions, basophils can be rapidly recruited into inflamed tissue ( Miyake and Karasuyama, 2017 74. Miyake, K. ∙ Karasuyama, H. Emerging roles of basophils in allergic inflammation Allergol. Int. 2017; 66 :382-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we speculate that basophils are more likely to be proinflammatory in nature and underlie maladaptive neuroimmune processes. Our study provides additional evidence of evolutionarily distinct roles between mast cells and basophils in both health and disease.

For analysis of itch pattern and allergen-specific IgE related to atopic dermatitis (AD), numerical rating scale (NRS) itch scores and serum allergen-specific IgE repertoire were respectively reviewed on N = 159 subjects from the placebo group of the SOLO1 and SOLO2 phase 3 clinical trials ( Simpson et al., 2016 88. Simpson, E.L. ∙ Bieber, T. ∙ Guttman-Yassky, E. ..., SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 Investigators Two Phase 3 Trials of Dupilumab versus Placebo in Atopic Dermatitis N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375 :2335-2348 Crossref Scopus (675) PubMed Google Scholar ). Patient serum allergen-specific IgE repertoires were measured using the ImmunoCAP system (Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) for a panel of 12 allergens/antigens including Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus , Dermatophagoides farinae , Canadida albicans , Pityrosporum , cat dander, mountain juniper, white oak, olive tree, Staphylococcal enterotoxin A, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, Japanese cedar, and wall pellitory. Positive levels for each allergen were defined as an allergen-specific IgE concentration ≥ 0.35 kU/L ( McGowan et al., 2015 70. McGowan, E.C. ∙ Bloomberg, G.R. ∙ Gergen, P.J. ... Influence of early-life exposures on food sensitization and food allergy in an inner-city birth cohort J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2015; 135 :171-178 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In order to examine human basophil phenotypes, 12 adult patients with AD, who visited the Dermatology Clinic at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania from October 2018 to June 2019, and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Patients were diagnosed with AD according to the UK Working Party’s Diagnostic Criteria ( Williams et al., 1994 116. Williams, H.C. ∙ Burney, P.G. ∙ Hay, R.J. ... The U.K. Working Party’s Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis. I. Derivation of a minimum set of discriminators for atopic dermatitis Br. J. Dermatol. 1994; 131 :383-396 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The disease severity was assessed according to Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) ( Charman et al., 2013 14. Charman, C.R. ∙ Venn, A.J. ∙ Ravenscroft, J.C. ... Translating Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) scores into clinical practice by suggesting severity strata derived using anchor-based methods Br. J. Dermatol. 2013; 169 :1326-1332 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). After informed consent was obtained, peripheral blood was collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll density gradient purification and frozen at −80°C until assayed. These studies were conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All the patients provided written informed consent before participation in the studies. The local institutional review board or ethics committee at each study center oversaw study conduct and documentation.
Wild-type (WT) C56Bl/6J, C57BL/6- Kit W-sh/W-sh (also known as Sash −/− ), Mcpt8- Cre, R26-LSL-Gq-DREADD, Ai9, and Alox5 −/− mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Bas-TRECK and Ige −/− mice were donated by Dr. Masato Kubo (RIKEN, Yokohama Institute, Japan). Compound Trpv1 −/− Trpa1 −/− double - deficient mice were donated by Dr. Hongzhen Hu. Na V 1.8-Cre mice were provided by Dr. Rohini Kuner (Heidelberg University). Pirt GCamp3/+ mice were donated by Dr. Xinzhong Dong. Mcpt8- Cre:R26-LSL-Gq-DREADD mice were obtained by crossing Mcpt8- Cre animals with R26-LSL-Gq-DREADD animals. Na V 1.8-TdTomato mice were generated by crossing Na V 1.8-Cre mice with Ai9 mice. All experiments were conducted with the approval of the Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed on a standard 12:12 hour light-dark cycle with free access to food and water. For dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuron isolation, 4–6-week-old mice were used. For all other experiments, 8–12-week-old mice were used. Experiments were performed on independent cohorts of male and female mice and no differences between sexes were observed.
The right cheeks of mice were shaved 2 days prior to any treatments (day −2). To induce AD-associated acute itch flares, bilateral ear skin were topically treated with 0.5 nmol of MC903 (calcipotriol, Tocris Bioscience) in 15 μL of 100% ethanol and then with 20 μL of 5 mg/mL ovalbumin (OVA, Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) daily for 10 days (day 0 to day 9) to sensitize mice. Unsensitized control mice were treated with 15 μL of 100% ethanol (vehicle control) followed by 20 μL of 5 mg/mL OVA in PBS. On day 10, mice were given an intradermal (i.d.) injection of 20 μL of 2.5 mg/mL OVA in 0.9% saline in their right cheek in order to provoke acute itch responses. To test the specificity of the allergen response, sensitized (MC903 + OVA) mice were i.d. challenged with 20 μL of an irrelevant allergen, bovine serum albumin (BSA, 3.7 mg/mL in 0.9% saline; Sigma-Aldrich). As an alternative to this model, we passively sensitized mice with OVA in the setting of AD-like disease. AD-like disease was induced by topical MC903 (0.5 nmol in 15 μL of 100% ethanol) administration on bilateral ear skin of mice daily from day 0 to day 9. On day 8 and day 9, mice received an intravenous (i.v.) injection of 100 μL of 20 μg/mL anti-OVA IgE antibody (Bio-Rad) in PBS to induce passive sensitization. Control unsensitized mice received i.v injections with 100 μL PBS alone. On day 10, an acute itch flare was evoked by i.d. injection of 20 μL of 2.5 mg/mL OVA in 0.9% saline into the right cheek. To assess allergen-mediated acute itch in the steady state, mice were passively sensitized to OVA via i.v. injection of 100 μL of 20 μg/mL anti-OVA IgE antibody in PBS on day 0 and day 1. Control unsensitized mice received i.v. injections of 100 μL PBS alone. On day 2, mice were challenged i.d. with 20 μL of 2.5 mg/mL OVA in 0.9% saline in their right cheek to provoke acute itch. The systemic sensitization model was induced as previously described ( Huang et al., 2016 40. Huang, C.C. ∙ Kim, Y.S. ∙ Olson, W.P. ... A histamine-independent itch pathway is required for allergic ocular itch J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 137 :1267-1270.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, OVA (0.2 mg/mL in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared fresh each time and was emulsified with an equal volume of Imject Alum (alum; Thermo Scientific). Mice received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 200 μl of OVA + alum mixture or control PBS + alum mixture on day 0 and day 9. On day 13, mice were challenged i.d. with 20 μL of 2.5 mg/mL OVA in 0.9% saline in their right cheek. To test acute itch flares in the setting of systemic sensitization along with AD-like disease, we sensitized mice with i.p. injection of 200 μL of OVA + alum mixture (prepared as above) on day 0 and day 9. Concurrently, bilateral ear skin were treated topically with MC903 (0.5 nmol in 15 μL of 100% ethanol) from day 3 to day 12. To provoke acute itch flares, mice were challenged with i.d. injection of 20 μL of 2.5 mg/mL OVA in 0.9% saline in the right cheek on day 13. For all models, scratching behavior was recorded for 60 minutes before i.d. allergen (OVA or BSA) challenge and for 70 minutes after challenge.
To assess mouse ear skin inflammation induced by MC903 + OVA, ear thickness was measured daily with dial calipers as previously described ( Kim et al., 2013 49. Kim, B.S. ∙ Siracusa, M.C. ∙ Saenz, S.A. ... TSLP elicits IL-33-independent innate lymphoid cell responses to promote skin inflammation Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5 :170ra16 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar , 2014a 50. Kim, B.S. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Siracusa, M.C. ... Basophils promote innate lymphoid cell responses in inflamed skin J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :3717-3725 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to i.d. OVA challenge on experimental day 10 of the AD-associated acute itch flare model, mice were euthanized and tissues were harvested for analysis. The ear skin were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Thermo Scientific) and embedded in paraffin before sectioning and staining with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E). Slides were imaged using the NanoZoomer 2.0-HT System (Hamamatsu).
In our passive sensitization model, mice were treated with an i.p. injection of 100 μL the H1R antagonist olopatadine (3 mg/kg in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and subcutaneous (s.c.) injection (nape) with 100 μL of the H4R antagonist JNJ7777120 (20 mg/kg in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) 30 minutes prior to i.d. OVA challenge.
In the AD-associated acute itch flare model, mice were treated 30 minutes prior to i.d. OVA challenge (day 10) with i.p. injection of 100 μL of the H1R antagonist olopatadine (3 mg/kg in of PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and s.c. injection (nape) of 100 μL of the H4R antagonist JNJ7777120 (20 mg/kg in of PBS; Sigma-Aldrich). Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) was blocked by the administration of 100 μL of FSLLRY-NH2 (7.5 mg/kg in 0.9% saline; Sigma-Aldrich) i.p. 30 minutes prior to i.d. OVA challenge (day 10). To inhibit serotonin synthesis, 200 μL of p -Chlorophenylalanine (pCPA, 150 mg/kg in 0.9% saline; Tocris Bioscience) was i.p. injected on day 7, day 8, and day 9 of the 10-day sensitization process. Mice were gavaged with 100 μL of the leukotriene (LT) pathway inhibitor zileuton (50 mg/kg in 0.5% cellulose; Sigma-Aldrich) 60 minutes prior to assessment of chronic spontaneous itch (day 10) or 60 minutes prior to i.d. OVA challenge when assessing acute itch flare behavior (day 10). The LTB4 receptor antagonist CP-105,696 (100 μL of 3 mg/kg CP-105,696 in 0.5% cellulose; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered by oral gavage 60 minutes prior to i.d. OVA challenge. Oral gavage of 100 μL of the CysLTR1 antagonist zafirlukast (10 mg/kg in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) was given twice on day 9, and once on day 10, 60 minutes prior to i.d. OVA challenge. Mice were given two 100 μL i.p. injections of the CysLTR2 antagonist HAMI3379 (0.4 mg/kg in of PBS; Cayman) on day 9, and once on day 10, 60 minutes prior to assessment of chronic spontaneous itch (day 10) or 60 minutes prior to i.d. OVA challenge for the assessment of acute itch flare behavior (day 10).
All applicable behavioral tests were performed and analyzed with the experimenter blinded to genotype with the exception of the Sash −/− strain given the genotypic differences in coat color. Itch behavior experiments were performed between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m CST. Two days prior to recording, animals were habituated in the test chamber for 90 minutes and underwent a series of three mock i.d. injections where a capped needle was pressed against the shaved cheek of the experimental mouse. On the day of behavioral test, animals were allowed to acclimatize to the test chamber for 10 minutes prior to video recording. Video recordings were manually scored to assess the number of scratching bouts during a 30-minute period. A bout of scratching was defined as an instance of hind paw directed continuous scratching of the back, cheeks, or ears that ended when the mouse placed their hind paw in their mouth or to the chamber floor. To test the pruritogenic capability of N -methyl (N-met) LTC4, histamine and basophil-derived factors in supernatant, 20 μL of solution was i.d. injected into the shaved right cheeks of mice before immediate assessment of itch behavior. Only scratching bouts directed toward the site of injection were scored. For N-met LTC4 (Cayman) and histamine (Sigma-Aldrich), a range of doses were tested, 0–10,000 μg and 0–1.5 μg respectively. For basophil-derived factors, we collected supernatants from OVA-stimulated basophils. Briefly, 6 × 10 4 – 8 × 10 4 basophils, sorted from mouse blood and cultured overnight, were incubated with 2.5 mg/ml OVA in 0.9% saline (200 μL) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for 60 minutes. Collected supernatants was delivered i.d. undiluted (20 μL).
To measure mouse serum OVA-specific IgE levels, 0.5–1 mL of blood was collected into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and allowed to clot for 60 minutes at room temperature. Tubes were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,000 g at 4°C. Sera were collected and stored at −80°C until OVA-specific IgE was quantified using the mouse OVA-IgE ELISA kit (Biolegend) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
To measure mouse serum LTB4 and LTC4 levels, 0.5–1 mL of blood was collected into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes 30 minutes after allergen challenge and allowed to clot for 60 minutes at room temperature. Tubes were then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1,000 g at 4°C. Serum was collected and stored at −80°C until LTB4 and LTC4 were respectively quantified using the mouse LTB4 ELISA kit (Biomatik) and mouse LTC4 ELISA kit (LS Bio) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
To test supernatant levels of LTC4 derived from basophils, sort-purified basophils (6 × 10 4 – 8 × 10 4 cells) were stimulated with 0.25 mg/mL OVA in 200 μL of saline at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in a 96 plate well for 60 minutes. After centrifuge for 20 minutes at 1,000 g at 4°C, supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C until LTC4 was quantified using the mouse LTC4 ELISA kit (LS Bio) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For human studies, thawed PBMCs were stained with Zombie UV viability dye (1:500; Biolegend) at room temperature for 20 minutes, washed and then stained with primary antibodies on ice for 30 minutes before being acquired on a BD Fortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences). Human Basophils were defined as live CD123 + FcεRIα + cells that lacked expression of c-Kit and lineage (Lin) markers CD3, CD4, CD19, CD14, CD34, and CD56. Marker CD203c was included in the primary antibodies to reveal the activation state of human basophils.
For animal studies, 50–100 μL of blood was collected into EDTA coated tubes, followed by RBC lysis using RBC lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 5 minutes twice and washed by PBS once. All cells were stained with Zombie UV viability dye (1:500; Biolegend) for viability at room temperature for 20 minutes, followed by primary antibodies on ice for 30 minutes prior to data acquisition on a BD Fortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences). Basophils were defined as live CD49b + FcεRIα/IgE + cells that were negative for expression of c-Kit and Lin markers CD3e, CD5, CD11c, CD19, and NK1.1. The mouse basophil canonical activation marker CD200R was also stained. All flow cytometry data were analyzed with Flowjo v10 software (Tree Star).
Immunofluorescence imaging was performed as previously described ( Huang et al., 2018 41. Huang, C.C. ∙ Yang, W. ∙ Guo, C. ... Anatomical and functional dichotomy of ocular itch and pain Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1268-1276 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). For ex vivo immunofluorescence staining of basophil degranulation in our AD-associated acute itch flare model, skin (OVA challenge site) from the right cheeks of Sash −/− mice were harvested 30 minutes following i.d. OVA challenge. Then, samples were fixed in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific) for 4–6 hours at 4°C and incubated in 30% sucrose overnight. Tissues were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (Sakura) and sectioned at 12 μm on a cryotome (Leica). Sections were dried and stained with 200 μL avidin-Texas Red (5 μg/mL; Invitrogen) in room temperature for 30 minutes before imaging on a Nikon Al Confocal Laser Microscope with NIS-Elements imaging software (Nikon Instruments).
To detect basophil degranulation ex vivo , 0.5–1 mL of blood from naive Mcpt8 -Cre:R26-LSL-Gq-DREADD and littermate control Mcpt8 -Cre-YFP mice was collected into EDTA-coated tubes. Samples were then treated with RBC lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 5 minutes twice and washed by PBS once. Following negative selection for CD4, CD8a, CD11c, and B220 using a Mouse Streptavidin RapidSpheres Isolation Kit (STEMCELL), purified leukocytes from each mouse were incubated with 200 μL clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 400 μM in PBS; Hello Bio) and 200 μL avidin-Texas Red (5 μg/mL; Invitrogen) simultaneously for 30 minutes at room temperature before imaging on a Nikon Al Confocal Laser Microscope with NIS-Elements imaging software (Nikon Instruments).
To examine the knockdown effect of in vivo siRNA treatment, WT mice that received intracisternal injection of siRNA were euthanized on day 10 of the AD-associated acute itch flare model. Then mice trigeminal ganglia were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific) for 4–6 hours at 4°C followed by incubation in 30% sucrose overnight. Tissues were embedded in OCT medium (Sakura) and sectioned at 12 μm on a cryotome (Leica). For further staining, sectioned tissues were blocked with 10% goat serum (Abcam) in UltraCruz blocking reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 minutes and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Images were taken and analyzed using a Nikon Al Confocal Laser Microscope with NIS-Elements imaging software (Nikon Instruments). Primary antibodies used: anti-CysLTR2 receptor monoclonal antibody (B-7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100) and guinea pig anti-PGP9.5 polyclonal antibody (Abcam; 1:500). Secondary antibodies used: m-IgGκ BP-FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100) and Cy3 AffiniPure donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:500).
To chemogenetically activate basophils in vivo , Mcpt8- Cre:R26-LSL-Gq-DREADD mice received a single i.p. injection of 50 μL of 1 mg/kg CNO (Hello Bio) in PBS. Mice were video recorded for 60 minutes after CNO injection and the itch behavior was quantified by manually counting the number of scratching bouts from 10 minutes to 40 minutes after CNO injection.
Basophil depletion was performed as previously described ( Noti et al., 2013 77. Noti, M. ∙ Wojno, E.D. ∙ Kim, B.S. ... Thymic stromal lymphopoietin-elicited basophil responses promote eosinophilic esophagitis Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1005-1013 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, for pharmacologic depletion of basophils, WT mice received i.v. injections of 100 μL of purified anti-mouse CD200R3 antibody (1.0 mg/mL; Biolegend) or Rat IgG2a, κ isotype control (Biolegend) on day 7 and day 9 of the AD-associated acute itch flare model. For basophil genetic depletion, Bas-TRECK and littermate control mice were given an i.p. injection of 500 ng diphtheria toxin (DT; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 100 μL PBS daily on two consecutive days prior to the last day of the disease model. Specifically, in the AD-associated acute itch flare model (MC903 + OVA), mice were treated with DT i.p. on experimental day 8 and day 9. In the mouse model sensitized with i.p. OVA + alum, DT was i.p. injected on day 11 and day 12. The effect of depletion was confirmed by assessing blood basophil levels using flow cytometry prior to i.d. OVA challenge on the last day of each model.
Basophil sorting and cultures were performed as previously described ( Hussain et al., 2018 42. Hussain, M. ∙ Borcard, L. ∙ Walsh, K.P. ... Basophil-derived IL-4 promotes epicutaneous antigen sensitization concomitant with the development of food allergy J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2018; 141 :223-234.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 0.5–1 mL of mouse blood was collected into EDTA coated tubes. Red blood cells were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). All live, CD45 + Lin - CD49b + FcεRIα/IgE + basophils from donor mice were sort-purified using an Aria II (BD Biosciences). Isolated basophils (6 × 10 4 – 8 × 10 4 cells /mL) were then cultured in Mast Cell Medium (RPMI 1640, 15% fetal bovine serum [FBS; Sigma-Aldrich], 100 U/mL penicillin [GIBCO], 100 μg/mL streptomycin [GIBCO], 2.9 mg/mL glutamine [Corning], 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol [GIBCO], 1 mM sodium pyruvate [Corning], 1 × nonessential amino acids [Corning], 10 mM HEPES) overnight at 37°C and 5% CO 2 before further stimulation.
Mouse DRG neurons were extracted, dissociated, and cultured as previously described ( Kim et al., 2014b 51. Kim, Y.S. ∙ Chu, Y. ∙ Han, L. ... Central terminal sensitization of TRPV1 by descending serotonergic facilitation modulates chronic pain Neuron. 2014; 81 :873-887 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oetjen et al., 2017 78. Oetjen, L.K. ∙ Mack, M.R. ∙ Feng, J. ... Sensory Neurons Co-opt Classical Immune Signaling Pathways to Mediate Chronic Itch Cell. 2017; 171 :217-228.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 4–6 week-old mice were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation. The DRGs were dissected and enzymatically dissociated with 1 mL Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ -free HBSS containing collagenase type I (342 U/mL; GIBCO) and dispase II (3.8 U/mL; GIBCO) for 30 minutes at 37°C. After digestion, neurons were gently triturated, pelleted, and then resuspended in Neurobasal-A culture medium (GIBCO) containing 2% B-27 supplement (GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin plus 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 ng/mL nerve growth factor (NGF, Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/mL glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; Sigma-Aldrich), and 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons were then plated on 8 mm glass coverslips pre-coated with poly-D-lysine (PDL, 20 μg/mL) and laminin (20 μg/mL). Cells were cultured overnight at 37°C and 5% CO 2 before use in calcium imaging studies.
All reagents were applied to DRG neurons by perfusion except for basophil-derived factors, which were manually loaded by gently pipetting the culture supernatants into the recording chamber. Only sensory neurons that were responsive to a final challenge of KCl (50 mM) were used in downstream analyses. For cultured DRG neurons isolated from calcium reporter Pirt GCaMP3/+ mice, fluorescence was recorded at 488 nm excitation wavelength using an inverted Nikon Ti-S microscope (Nikon Instruments) with CoolSNAP HQ 2 CCD camera (Photometrics) and NIS-elements software (Nikon Instruments). Cells were considered responsive to a particular stimulus if they exhibited at least a 15% increase in fluorescent intensity to baseline. For non-reporter mice (WT, Trpv1 −/− , Trpa1 −/− , and compound Trpv1 −/− Trpa1 −/− mice), cultured DRG neurons were first loaded with the calcium indicator dye Fura-2 AM (4 μM; Invitrogen) in DRG culture medium for 30 minutes at 37°C. Before use, cells were washed and incubated in calcium imaging buffer for at least 15 minutes at room temperature as previously described ( Oetjen et al., 2017 78. Oetjen, L.K. ∙ Mack, M.R. ∙ Feng, J. ... Sensory Neurons Co-opt Classical Immune Signaling Pathways to Mediate Chronic Itch Cell. 2017; 171 :217-228.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ). Images were acquired with alternating 340 nm and 380 nm excitation wavelengths (F340, F380) using an inverted Nikon Ti-S microscope (Nikon Instruments) with CoolSNAP HQ 2 CCD camera (Photometrics) and NIS-elements software (Nikon Instruments). Cells were considered responsive if they demonstrated a change in fluorescence ratio (340/380) > 15% to baseline.
Basophil-derived factors were collected from OVA-stimulated cultures. Briefly, sort-purified and cultured basophils (6,000–8,000) were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 400 g at 4°C. Then, supernatants were carefully removed and the remaining basophils were stimulated with 0.25 mg/mL OVA in 200 μL of calcium imaging buffer at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for one hour. After centrifugation for 20 minutes at 1000 g at 4°C, supernatants were collected and applied to cultured DRG neurons (100 μL per culture slide) to test for neuronal activation as indicated by an intracellular calcium influx response. OVA solution (0.25 mg/mL in calcium imaging buffer) or N-met LTC4 (100 nM; Cayman) was applied by perfusion onto cultured DRG neurons to test for calcium responses. For additional characterization, responsiveness to the following reagents was also assessed: the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (500 nM; Sigma-Aldrich); the TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC; 100 μM; Sigma-Aldrich); serotonin (5-HT) (200 μM; Sigma-Aldrich); β-alanine (1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich); and chloroquine (2 mM; Sigma-Aldrich).
Na V 1.8-TdTomato recipients were sublethally X-ray irradiated (950 cGy) using X-RAD 320 (Precision X-Ray). 10 × 10 6 bone marrow cells from Mcpt8 -Cre-YFP mice were i.v. injected into the recipient mice within 24 hours after radiation. Sulfatrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) was added to the drinking water of the irradiated animals (5mL/200mL) from one day prior to radiation until 1 week post-radiation and reconstitution. Irradiated mice were used for experimentation 8 weeks following bone marrow transplantation, allowing for full immune reconstitution. Chimerism was tested 4 weeks after reconstitution by measuring the presence of YFP + cells in the peripheral blood by flow cytometry.
In vivo two-photon imaging of cell trafficking was performed as previously described ( Wang et al., 2012 108. Wang, B. ∙ Zinselmeyer, B.H. ∙ Runnels, H.A. ... In vivo imaging implicates CCR2(+) monocytes as regulators of neutrophil recruitment during arthritis Cell. Immunol. 2012; 278 :103-112 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the right cheeks of mice were shaved the day prior to imaging. On day 10 of the AD-associated acute itch model, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, placed on a warming pad and their right cheeks were secured to the imaging chamber using VetBond (cat #1469SB, 3 M). Time-lapse imaging was performed pre- and post-challenge with i.d. OVA by using a custom-built dual-laser video-rate two-photon microscope. To visualize blood vessels, 20 μL of non-targeted Qtracker 655 vascular labels (Invitrogen) were diluted in 100 μL of PBS and i.v. injected 15–30 minutes before imaging. Qtracker 655-labeled blood vessels and YFP-labeled basophils were excited by a Chameleon Vision II Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent) tuned to 920 nm in Mcpt8 -Cre-YFP mice. Fluorescence emission was detected as red (> 560 nm), green (495–560 nm), and blue (< 495 nm). To assess potential basophil-neuron interactions, YFP-labeled basophils and TdTomato-labeled nerves in bone marrow chimeric mice ( Mcpt8 -Cre × Na V 1.8-TdTomato) were excited by a Chameleon Vision II Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent) tuned to 950 nm. Fluorescence emission was detected as red (> 540 nm), green (495–540 nm) and blue (< 495 nm). Each plane represents an image of 300 μm by 300 μm at 0.585 μm/pixel. Z stacks were acquired by taking 31 sequential steps at 2 μm spacing. Image reconstruction and multidimensional rendering were performed with Imaris (Bitplane). Cell track datasets were generated in Imaris using automated spot tracking and analyzed in MotilityLab ( 2Ptrack.net ). In cases where motion artifacts induced z-plane tracking errors, cells were manually tracked using an orthogonal perspective in Imaris. To identify interactions between basophils and nerves, we inferred cell-cell contacts first by looking for evidence that the cells made apparent contacts with nerves in 3D rendered images. We then digitally zoomed into apparent contact regions and rotated them in 3D to confirm that green pixels (basophils) and red pixels (nerves) were in direct apposition. This was performed frame by frame in the videos to measure basophil-nerve interaction durations. The caveat to this approach is that we can only infer cell-cell interactions due to the limits of our image resolution, which is 0.585 μm in X and Y, and 2 μm in the Z-dimension. The interaction duration was then normalized to cell number by dividing the sum of apparent contact durations by the number of cells in each image.
We performed CysLTR2 siRNA knockdown in vivo by delivering siRNA using intracisternal (i.c.) injection as previously described ( Li et al., 2019 62. Li, F. ∙ Yang, W. ∙ Jiang, H. ... TRPV1 activity and substance P release are required for corneal cold nociception Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5678 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2011 64. Liu, X.Y. ∙ Liu, Z.C. ∙ Sun, Y.G. ... Unidirectional cross-activation of GRPR by MOR1D uncouples itch and analgesia induced by opioids Cell. 2011; 147 :447-458 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). The napes of the mice were shaved 2 days prior to the i.c. treatment. RVG-9R trifluoroacetate salt (BECHEM) was dissolved with 10% glucose (Fisher Scientific) to reach the concentration of 1.45 μg/μL. Meanwhile, siGENOME non-targeting siRNA control pools (Horizon) or siGENOME mouse CysLTR2 siRNA (Horizon) was dissolved with nuclease free water (Thermo Scientific) to reach the final concentration of 1 μg/μL. Before injection, 5 μL of RVG-9R (1.45 μg/μL in 10% glucose) was mixed with 5 μL of siRNA (1 μg/μL in nuclease free water) and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. To deliver the RVG-9R + siRNA mixture, adult WT mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and then the mixture of RVG-9R and siRNA (10 μL) was injected slowly into the cisterna magna daily from day 7 to day 9 of the AD-associated acute itch flare model. On experimental day 10, trigeminal ganglia were dissected and stained for CysLTR2 to validate the knockdown effect.
Normally distributed group data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed Student’s t test. If data were not normally distributed, median (interquartile range) was used and statistical significance was determined using the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney nonparametric test. For tests with multiple comparisons, the Two-way ANOVA test was used. Differences of incidence rate between two groups were compared by Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test when total N assessed in the contingency tables was less than 40 or when the expected frequency of one or more cells was less than 5. Data from independent experiments were pooled when possible or represent at least two independent replicates. Sample sizes were chosen based on pilot experiments to accurately detect statistical significance as well as considering technical feasibility, resource availability, and ethical animal and sample use. No samples or animals subjected to successful procedures and/or treatments were excluded from analysis. Statistical details can be found in figure legends. All statistical tests were conducted with GraphPad Prism 8. Significance is labeled as: ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗ p < 0.05, N.S., Not Significant.
