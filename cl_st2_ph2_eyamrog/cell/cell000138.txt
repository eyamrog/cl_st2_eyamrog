Title: Intergenerationally Maintained Histone H4 Lysine 16 Acetylation Is Instructive for Future Gene Activation


Abstract: Summary

Before zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the quiescent genome undergoes reprogramming to transition into the transcriptionally active state. However, the mechanisms underlying euchromatin establishment during early embryogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is maintained from oocytes to fertilized embryos in Drosophila and mammals. H4K16ac forms large domains that control nucleosome accessibility of promoters prior to ZGA in flies. Maternal depletion of MOF acetyltransferase leading to H4K16ac loss causes aberrant RNA Pol II recruitment, compromises the 3D organization of the active genomic compartments during ZGA, and causes downregulation of post-zygotically expressed genes. Germline depletion of histone deacetylases revealed that other acetyl marks cannot compensate for H4K16ac loss in the oocyte. Moreover, zygotic re-expression of MOF was neither able to restore embryonic viability nor onset of X chromosome dosage compensation. Thus, maternal H4K16ac provides an instructive function to the offspring, priming future gene activation.

Section: Introduction

The fusion of the maternal and paternal gametes triggers a remarkable transition from two fully differentiated cells to a totipotent zygote that gives rise to all tissues during embryogenesis. In flies, the development of the embryo during the first 13 synchronized nuclear divisions relies on maternally provided proteins and transcripts. These maternal elements are replaced by newly synthesized ones during the major wave of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the nuclear cycle (nc) 14 at embryonic stage (st) 5 when the zygotic genome has reformed to accommodate the transcriptional active status ( Lefebvre and Lécuyer, 2018; Schulz and Harrison, 2019 48.

Increase in nucleosome accessibility as well as gradual enrichment of RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) are observed from nc11 ( Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015; Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016; Chen et al., 2013 14.

The few transcripts that are activated before ZGA (during the minor zygotic wave) are under the control of the pioneer transcription factor Zelda, which mediates local chromatin accessibility ( Harrison et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2008; Schulz and Harrison, 2019; Sun et al., 2015 36.

However, the mechanisms that guide the reprogramming of the entire genome are not fully understood.
Acetylation of histone tails is known to promote transcriptional activation ( Barnes et al., 2019; Gräff and Tsai, 2013 11. Barnes, C.E. ∙ English, D.M. ∙ Cowley, S.M. Acetylation & Co: an expanding repertoire of histone acylations regulates chromatin and transcription Essays Biochem. 2019; 63 :97-107 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Gräff, J. ∙ Tsai, L.H. Histone acetylation: molecular mnemonics on the chromatin Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14 :97-111 Crossref Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the histone modifications positively correlated with transcription activation, H4K16ac is unique because it prevents chromatin compaction in vitro ( Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006 78. Shogren-Knaak, M. ∙ Ishii, H. ∙ Sun, J.-M. ... Histone H4-K16 acetylation controls chromatin structure and protein interactions Science. 2006; 311 :844-847 Crossref Scopus (1466) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the developmental dynamics and the biological significance of this modification in the embryonic genome prior to ZGA remain unclear. H4K16ac is deposited by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) males absent on the first (MOF) ( Akhtar and Becker, 2001; Hilfiker et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2005 5. Akhtar, A. ∙ Becker, P.B.

Biol. 2005; 25 :9175-9188 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MOF-containing male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is responsible for chromosome-wide upregulation of the male X chromosome to equalize its expression to the female X as well as to autosomal genes ( Gelbart et al., 2009; Kind et al., 2008 31. Gelbart, M.E. ∙ Larschan, E. ∙ Peng, S. ... Drosophila MSL complex globally acetylates H4K16 on the male X chromosome for dosage compensation Nat. Struct. Mol.

Genome-wide analysis reveals MOF as a key regulator of dosage compensation and gene expression in Drosophila Cell. 2008; 133 :813-828 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). The complex consists of five proteins (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MOF, and MLE) together with two long non-coding RNAs, RNA on the X 1 and 2 ( roX1 , roX2 ), and is capable of specifically recognizing the single male X chromosome ( Samata and Akhtar, 2018 73. Samata, M. ∙ Akhtar, A. Dosage Compensation of the X Chromosome: A Complex Epigenetic Assignment Involving Chromatin Regulators and Long Noncoding RNAs Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :323-350 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, all MSL proteins, apart from MSL2, are maternally deposited as transcripts ( Lott et al., 2011 52. Lott, S.E. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ∙ Schroth, G.P. ... Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1000590 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ) and proteins, which remain stable through the early embryonic stages ( Rastelli et al., 1995 69. Rastelli, L. ∙ Richman, R. ∙ Kuroda, M.I. The dosage compensation regulators MLE, MSL-1 and MSL-2 are interdependent since early embryogenesis in Drosophila Mech. Dev. 1995; 53 :223-233 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it has not been determined whether they form a functional complex.
Here, by analyzing precisely staged Drosophila embryos before and after ZGA and by performing genetic and genomic experiments, we show that H4K16ac is intergenerationally transmitted from the female germline and has a fundamental role in controlling chromatin accessibility in the absence of ongoing transcription during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, it poises promoters for future gene activation.

Section: Results

We set out to investigate H4K16ac deposition during gametogenesis. Immunostaining of Drosophila ovaries revealed that H4K16ac is abundant in the nuclei of developing and mature oocytes ( Figures 1 A and S1 D) but absent from late spermatids ( Figures 1 B and S1 A). We verified the specificity of the H4K16ac oocyte signal by germline depletion of MOF via RNAi ( Figures 1 A and S1 B). To address whether MOF-mediated maternal H4K16ac deposition relies on the MSL complex, we depleted MSL3 from the maternal pool ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Consistent with the role of MSL3 in enhancing MOF catalytic activity in somatic cells ( Buscaino et al., 2003; Buscaino et al., 2006; Kadlec et al., 2011 18. Buscaino, A. ∙ Köcher, T. ∙ Kind, J.H. ... MOF-regulated acetylation of MSL-3 in the Drosophila dosage compensation complex Mol. Cell. 2003; 11 :1265-1277 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar 19. Buscaino, A. ∙ Legube, G. ∙ Akhtar, A. X-chromosome targeting and dosage compensation are mediated by distinct domains in MSL-3 EMBO Rep. 2006; 7 :531-538 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar 44. Kadlec, J. ∙ Hallacli, E. ∙ Lipp, M. ... Structural basis for MOF and MSL3 recruitment into the dosage compensation complex by MSL1 Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :142-149 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), msl-3 germline RNAi decreased H4K16ac levels in oocytes, suggesting a functional interaction between MOF and MSL3 in female ovaries ( Figures 1 A and S1 E).
Because the mature oocyte is transcriptionally inactive, observing a robust signal for H4K16ac was unexpected. It prompted us to test whether the H4K16ac signal is propagated to the progeny and to this end we performed immunostaining of fertilized eggs 0–30 min after egg laying (AEL) to capture the time of fertilization ( Figure 1 C). The maternal pronucleus, through which H3K27me3 is inherited to the progeny, was previously reported to be devoid of histone acetylation ( Loppin et al., 2015; Sobel et al., 1995; Zenk et al., 2017 51. Loppin, B. ∙ Dubruille, R. ∙ Horard, B. The intimate genetics of Drosophila fertilization Open Biol. 2015; 5 :150076 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 81. Sobel, R.E. ∙ Cook, R.G. ∙ Perry, C.A. ... Conservation of deposition-related acetylation sites in newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92 :1237-1241 Crossref Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar 95. Zenk, F. ∙ Loeser, E. ∙ Schiavo, R. ... Germ line-inherited H3K27me3 restricts enhancer function during maternal-to-zygotic transition Science. 2017; 357 :212-216 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). H4K5ac and H4K12ac get deposited de novo on the paternal pronucleus at fertilization during the replacement of protamines with histones ( Loppin et al., 2015; Sobel et al., 1995 51. Loppin, B. ∙ Dubruille, R. ∙ Horard, B. The intimate genetics of Drosophila fertilization Open Biol. 2015; 5 :150076 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 81. Sobel, R.E. ∙ Cook, R.G. ∙ Perry, C.A. ... Conservation of deposition-related acetylation sites in newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92 :1237-1241 Crossref Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, we detected H4K16ac on both maternal and paternal pronuclei during oocyte meiosis II ( Figure 1 C) and apposition of the parental pronuclei ( Figures 1 D and S1 F). Given the absence of bulk H4K16ac signal in late stages of spermatogenesis, the deposition of H4K16ac on the paternal pronucleus must happen de novo upon fertilization. De novo acetylation of H4K8 was also detected on the paternal pronucleus; however, it remained absent from the maternal pronucleus ( Figure 1 E). Furthermore, H4K16ac was retained on all chromosomes throughout the first ( Figure 1 F) and subsequent zygotic divisions ( Figure S2 A). These data show that H4K16ac is intergenerationally maintained throughout early embryogenesis via its continuous association with both meiotic and mitotic chromosomes.
We next asked whether H4K16ac presence in oocytes is evolutionarily conserved. Indeed, we observed H4K16ac enrichment in oocytes of two distant fly species, Drosophila virilis and Drosophila busckii , separated from Drosophila melanogaster by 40 million years of evolution ( Figure 1 G). Next, we characterized whether H4K16ac is present on the maternal germline in mammals. We analyzed different stages of mouse oogenesis (oocytes in primary, secondary, and antral follicles; Figures S1 G and S1H), haploid metaphase I and II (MI and MII) oocytes ( Figure 1 H) as well as mouse zygotes upon fertilization and at the 2-cell stage ( Figure 1 I). Similar to flies, we observed that H4K16ac is enriched on chromatin during mitosis and meiosis and throughout oogenesis and early mouse development in the absence of active transcription, indicating a conserved function.
H4K16ac was also abundantly detectable in early developing embryos prior to ZGA ( Figures 2 A–C and S2 A) and its levels were sensitive to germline depletion of MOF and MSL3 ( Figures 2 C and S2 B), whereas the bulk levels of H4K8ac or H4K12ac were unaffected ( Figures 2 D and S2 C). Given that MOF and MSL3 functionally interact in the deposition of H4K16ac, we tested whether they reside in the same protein complex. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the presence of an MSL sub-complex consisting of MOF, MSL3, and MSL1 in female ovaries and in 0–1.5 h embryos (maternal MSL sub-complex; Figures 2 E, S2 D, and S2 E). MSL2 is absent from ovaries and early embryos and is only expressed in males following ZGA ( Figures 2 F, bottom, and S2 F) ( Bashaw and Baker, 1995; Kelley et al., 1995; Lott et al., 2011 12.

Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1000590 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next performed immunostaining of MOF and MSL2 before and after ZGA to assess the chromatin association of the maternal and canonical MSL (sub)complexes. MOF was robustly detected on all chromosomes before ZGA at st4 ( Figure 2 F). A diffuse X chromosome territory formed by MSL2 was first detectable at st5 in male embryos. In contrast, MOF accumulation on the male X chromosome was slower, only beginning at st6 and maturing at st7 ( Figure 2 F). This pattern of X chromosome territory formation coincides with roX RNA expression: roX1 is expressed at st3–4, while roX2 shows slower kinetics ( Lott et al., 2011; Meller, 2003; Meller and Rattner, 2002 52. Lott, S.E. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ∙ Schroth, G.P. ... Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1000590 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Meller, V.H. Initiation of dosage compensation in Drosophila embryos depends on expression of the roX RNAs Mech. Dev. 2003; 120 :759-767 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Meller, V.H. ∙ Rattner, B.P. The roX genes encode redundant male-specific lethal transcripts required for targeting of the MSL complex EMBO J. 2002; 21 :1084-1091 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 F). These findings suggest that H4K16ac deposition by the maternal MSL sub-complex precedes the onset of major embryonic transcriptional activation and the onset of X chromosome dosage compensation.
We performed a systematic evaluation of the genomic localization of H4K16ac by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis using MNase-digested chromatin derived from hand-staged embryos. Genome-wide profiles were generated from preblastoderm (st3–4, prior to ZGA), blastoderm (st5, ZGA), gastrulating (st7), and older embryos (14–16 h AEL, st15; Figures 3 A and S3 A). Peak-calling analysis identified approximately 7,000 H4K16ac-positive promoters ( Figures 3 B and 3C), the majority of which remained marked by H4K16ac throughout development ( Figures 3 C, right, and 3 E; example snapshots can be seen in Figure 3 D). We next compared the H4K16ac signal to other promoter-associated histone modifications ( Figures 3 E and S3 B–S3D). In contrast to H3K36me3 and H3K4me3, H4K16ac was enriched on promoters before the major wave of transcription ( Figure 3 E). Furthermore, consistent with the localization of MOF ( Figure 2 F), bulk enrichment of H4K16ac on the male X chromosome was only scored from st7 onwards ( Figures 3 C, left, 3 E, and S3 C, cluster 1), hinting towards a genome-wide function that is not restricted to dosage compensation.
The presence of H4K16ac prior to ZGA prompted us to address whether it may have a chromatin architectural role rather than a role in directly modulating transcription. We used maternal depletion of MOF to mediate H4K16ac loss in early embryonic stages and analyzed local nucleosome accessibility using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq; Buenrostro et al., 2013; Buenrostro et al., 2015 16. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Giresi, P.G. ∙ Zaba, L.C. ... Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :1213-1218 Crossref Scopus (4008) PubMed Google Scholar 17. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Wu, B. ∙ Chang, H.Y. ... ATAC-seq: A Method for Assaying Chromatin Accessibility Genome-Wide Curr Protoc Mol Biol. 2015; 109 :21.29.1-21.29.9 Crossref Scopus (1646) PubMed Google Scholar ) prior to the onset of the major wave of zygotic transcription. Remarkably, we observed that maternal depletion of MOF resulted in a global decrease of nucleosome accessibility in st3–4 embryos ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Furthermore, maternal msl-3 RNAi phenocopied MOF loss on global nucleosome accessibility as well as on MOF-sensitive ATAC-seq peaks during st5 ( Figures 3 F and 3H). The majority of MOF-sensitive ATAC-seq peaks were located within H4K16ac-positive genes ( Figures 3 G and S3 E) and consisted primarily of DNA binding sites for several developmental regulators as well as GAGA factor ( Figure S3 F). Therefore, H4K16ac at promoters ensures establishment of global open nucleosome conformation in vivo preceding the onset of the major zygotic genome activation.
Many of the H4K16ac-positive genes were distributed within large domains spanning 50 kb of average length ( Figures 4 A and S4 A–S4C). Because H4K16ac loss resulted in bulk loss of chromatin accessibility, we next addressed the potential impact of the H4K16ac domains on 3D chromosome conformation. The main topological structures—namely topologically associated domains (TADs)—emerge during the preblastoderm stages, whereas the organization of the genome into active and inactive compartments (A and B respectively) begins at st5 ( Hug et al., 2017; Ogiyama et al., 2018 40. Hug, C.B. ∙ Grimaldi, A.G. ∙ Kruse, K. ... Chromatin Architecture Emerges during Zygotic Genome Activation Independent of Transcription Cell. 2017; 169 :216-228.e.19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Ogiyama, Y. ∙ Schuettengruber, B. ∙ Papadopoulos, G.L. ... Polycomb-Dependent Chromatin Looping Contributes to Gene Silencing during Drosophila Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :73-88.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). To capture the consequences of H4K16ac loss during the major zygotic transcriptional wave, we generated in situ Hi-C datasets using st5 embryos depleted of maternal MOF ( Figure S4 D). We first considered whether H4K16ac is involved in TAD definition. Although we did not observe major differences with regard to their number or position ( Figures S4 E–S4G), the separation of TADs (insulation score) was globally weaker upon mof RNAi ( Figure 4 B). This was particularly visible in the active compartment, where H4K16ac was enriched ( Figures 4 B and S4 H). We next ranked the TAD boundaries based on the insulation score difference between mof and control RNAi ( Figure 4 C) and discovered that the most affected TAD boundaries were the ones most enriched in H4K16ac ( Figure 4 D). Notably, the higher the difference in insulation score on these TAD boundaries, the higher the number of identified downregulated genes ( Figure 4 E). Taken together, these data indicate that chromatin topology changes elicited by H4K16ac loss are reflected in local transcriptional defects in st5 embryos.
We addressed whether H4K16ac loss would affect higher order hierarchies, namely the A and B compartments, which are defined from long-range contacts. H4K16ac loss resulted in increased long-range contacts outside of TADs, a phenomenon that was more prominent within the H4K16ac domains and within the A compartment (on average 1.5 more abundant contacts upon mof RNAi; Figures 4 F and S4 I–S4K). The quantification of the compartmentalization (COMP) score across genomic distances ( Nuebler et al., 2018 59. Nuebler, J. ∙ Fudenberg, G. ∙ Imakaev, M. ... Chromatin organization by an interplay of loop extrusion and compartmental segregation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E6697-E6706 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ) further revealed a substantial decrease in segregation between the active and inactive compartments upon maternal MOF depletion ( Figures 4 G and S4 L–S4O). Overall, these data suggest that A compartment definition is compromised upon maternal H4K16ac loss.
To evaluate whether chromatin COMP defects and gene expression changes persist until later stages of embryogenesis, we generated Hi-C and gene expression profiles from st15 male and female embryos following germline MOF depletion. No significant change in the segregation of genomic compartments or in abundance of long-range contacts within the A compartment was observed ( Figures 4 F and 4G, right). On the other hand, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed numerous genes to be differentially expressed between mof and control RNAi ( Figures 4 H and S4 P). Because gene expression defects persist despite restoration of normal genome compartmentalization at st15, we hypothesize that embryonic transcription misregulation is driven by local H4K16ac loss rather than global remodeling of chromatin organization.
To further understand the role of this mark in early embryos we characterized the features of the genes exhibiting H4K16ac deposition. The embryo transcriptome consists of maternally deposited mRNAs (maternal genes) and newly synthesized zygotic transcripts. Most of the zygotic genes are expressed at st5 and onwards, with a limited number arising pre-ZGA (st3–4) during the minor zygotic wave ( Figures 2 A and 5 A) under control of the pioneer transcription factor Zelda ( Li et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2008 49. Li, X.-Y. ∙ Harrison, M.M. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ... Establishment of regions of genomic activity during the Drosophila maternal to zygotic transition eLife. 2014; 3 :e03737 Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar 50. Liang, H.L. ∙ Nien, C.Y. ∙ Liu, H.Y. ... The zinc-finger protein Zelda is a key activator of the early zygotic genome in Drosophila Nature. 2008; 456 :400-403 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 B and S5 A). We found that promoters of minor zygotic wave genes were devoid of H4K16ac ( Figures 5 B, S5 A, and S5 B), suggesting that Zelda and MOF-deposited H4K16ac have independent functions ( Figure S5 C).
H4K16ac-positive promoters in st3–4 embryos fell into two classes: maternal and zygotic genes ( Figure 5 C). We first checked when the H4K16ac-positive zygotic genes are expressed during fly development. The majority of the zygotic H4K16ac target genes are expressed at late embryonic or larval stages—“post-zygotic genes” ( Figure 5 D)—and have tissue-specific functions ( Figure S5 D). In order to investigate the functional consequences of H4K16ac loss on post-zygotic genes we performed RNA-seq on gastrulating embryos (st7), in which the expression of some of these genes had already commenced. Maternal MOF loss led to the overall downregulation of H4K16ac-positive zygotic targets ( Figures 5 E, S5 E, and S5 F).
The second class of H4K16ac targets during preblastoderm stages corresponded to maternal genes ( Figure 5 C). These H4K16ac-positive maternal genes produce transcripts that are constantly transcribed throughout development ( Figure 5 F, left). The zygotic expression of many of these maternal genes starts later than ZGA ( Lott et al., 2011 52. Lott, S.E. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ∙ Schroth, G.P. ... Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1000590 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ) given that the maternal transcript seems sufficient for early function. Nonetheless, H4K16ac is enriched on their promoters from st3–4 onwards, and their local nucleosome accessibility was compromised after maternal MOF loss ( Figure 5 F, middle). We thus hypothesized that their transcription might be compromised in the absence of maternal H4K16ac deposition. Because we would not be able to discriminate zygotic versus maternal transcripts by RNA-seq, we performed RNA Pol II ChIP-seq using maternal MOF-depleted st5 embryos. We observed a global reduction of RNA Pol II at promoters compared to control RNAi ( Figures 5 G and S5 G). Decreased recruitment of RNA Pol II was also seen specifically on mof -sensitive ATAC-seq peaks ( Figure 5 H). Indeed, H4K16ac loss led to compromised RNA Pol II recruitment at promoters of H4K16ac-positive maternal genes ( Figure 5 F, right). These data suggest that MOF and H4K16ac license efficient RNA Pol II recruitment on primed target genes via the maintenance of chromatin accessibility at these sites.
The consequences of maternal H4K16ac loss can be seen in the globally altered expression profiles of late st15 embryos. Bulk downregulation of expression is observed on X-linked and autosomal genes in male and female embryos , as well as on H4K16ac-primed targets ( Figures 5 I, S5 H, and S5 I). Furthermore, H4K16ac levels were still decreased on the primed targets in later embryonic stages ( Figures 5 J and S5 J). These results indicate that H4K16ac in the germline is important for future activation of its gene targets in the next generation.
To address whether restoration of H4K16ac in the embryo is sufficient to rescue its germline loss, we performed experiments to disentangle the germline versus embryonic functions of MOF and H4K16ac. We used the ovoD system to create ovarian mitotic mof -null clones ( Copur et al., 2018; Perrimon et al., 1984 24. Copur, Ö. ∙ Gorchakov, A. ∙ Finkl, K. ... Sex-specific phenotypes of histone H4 point mutants establish dosage compensation as the critical function of H4K16 acetylation in Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :13336-13341 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Perrimon, N. ∙ Engstrom, L. ∙ Mahowald, A.P. Developmental genetics of the 2E-F region of the Drosophila X chromosome: a region rich in “developmentally important” genes Genetics. 1984; 108 :559-572 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which give rise to zygotes with complete absence of maternal MOF ( Figure 6 A). The complete loss of maternal MOF led to 80% embryonic lethality ( Figure 6 B, compare bars 1 and 2). The survivors that reached adulthood were females ( Figure 6 C), highlighting the absolute requirement for MOF in male X chromosome regulation. We attempted to rescue the embryonic defects caused by germline MOF loss using transgenes induced at ZGA or later ( Figures 6 A and 6D). However, zygotic presence of MOF was insufficient to rescue embryonic lethality in these animals ( Figure 6 B, compare bar 2 to bars 3 and 4 ) . We conclude that the instructive function of MOF and H4K16ac in the germline is indispensable for embryonic development.
We next tested the functional significance of H4K16ac for the developing organism. We characterized the in vivo effects of H4K16ac loss in transgenic flies that express His4 -K16R variants mimicking a constitutively hypoacetylated state ( Kamieniarz and Schneider, 2009 45. Kamieniarz, K. ∙ Schneider, R. Tools to tackle protein acetylation Chem. Biol. 2009; 16 :1027-1029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) in a null histone locus background ( ΔHisC ). We analyzed the viability of animals lacking zygotic expression of endogenous canonical histones ( HisC mat+zyg-) while expressing 24 copies of the H4K16R transgene compared to their heterozygous siblings. We scored 100% male lethality as previously shown ( Armstrong et al., 2018; Copur et al., 2018 10. Armstrong, R.L. ∙ Penke, T.J.R. ∙ Strahl, B.D. ... Chromatin conformation and transcriptional activity are permissive regulators of DNA replication initiation in Drosophila Genome Res. 2018; 28 :1688-1700 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Copur, Ö. ∙ Gorchakov, A. ∙ Finkl, K. ... Sex-specific phenotypes of histone H4 point mutants establish dosage compensation as the critical function of H4K16 acetylation in Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :13336-13341 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), but to our surprise also observed 60% female lethality ( Figure 6 E). Furthermore, by evaluating the fecundity of the survivor females, we noted that they were sterile ( Figure 6 F). These results were further validated using flies that express 12 copies of the H4K16R transgene. In that case, the direct comparison with flies expressing a control H4wt transgene was possible ( Figures S6 A–S6D). Overall, these results are reminiscent of the mof -null (mat+zyg-) females that are sterile and short lived ( Conrad et al., 2012 23. Conrad, T. ∙ Cavalli, F.M. ∙ Holz, H. ...

Cell. 2012; 22 :610-624 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) and underscore the importance of H4K16ac in fly development in both males and females.
We tested whether bulk acetylation of histones using maternal histone deacetylase (HDAC) depletion would rescue gene expression misregulation in the progeny caused by maternal mof RNAi. Maternal depletion of HDACs sir2 , rpd3 , and hdac6 ( Figures 6 G and S6 E) in an otherwise wild-type (WT) background resulted in an increase of H4K16ac, as well as in other histone acetyl marks in embryos ( Figure 6 H, lanes 1–4). Furthermore, the gene expression of H4K16ac-positive zygotic genes at st5 increased upon HDAC RNAi ( Figure 6 I, compare black to orange bars). We next combined germline HDAC depletion with germline mof RNAi. Other histone acetyl marks were still increased compared to controls; however, the levels of H4K16ac did not recover upon combined mof and HDAC RNAi ( Figure 6 H, compare lanes 2–4 with 7–9). Interestingly, the H4K16ac targets were no longer upregulated but remained at the same reduced levels as observed in maternal mof RNAi alone ( Figure 6 I, compare blue to yellow bars). This experiment indicates that other acetylation marks are unable to restore expression from these targets in absence of maternal H4K16ac, suggesting that H4K16ac is uniquely responsible for the regulation of these target genes at st5.
H4K16ac has a well-known role in X chromosome regulation ( Akhtar and Becker, 2000; Gelbart et al., 2009; Hilfiker et al., 1997 4. Akhtar, A. ∙ Becker, P.B.

Consistent with previous reports, our stage-specific ChIP-seq dataset revealed prominent H4K16ac enrichment on the X chromosome compared to autosomes from st7 onwards ( Figures 3 E, 4 A, 7 A, S3 C, S4 C, and S7 A–S7C) ( Franke et al., 1996; Rastelli et al., 1995; Rieder et al., 2019 29.

However, the promoters of “future” dosage-compensated genes were already H4K16ac-positive at stages 3–4 ( Figure 7 A). We also assessed whether this was true for the high-affinity sites (HASs), which are genomic loci thought to be important for MSL complex recruitment ( Alekseyenko et al., 2012; Alekseyenko et al., 2008; Straub et al., 2008; Villa et al., 2016 7.

Villa, R. ∙ Schauer, T. ∙ Smialowski, P. ... PionX sites mark the X chromosome for dosage compensation Nature. 2016; 537 :244-248 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that HASs were H4K16ac-positive already in early stages ( Figure 7 B) and that maternal depletion of MOF or MSL3 led to a bulk decrease in their chromatin accessibility ( Figure 7 C). Therefore, the maternal MSL sub-complex deposits H4K16ac on the X-linked genes and HASs in a sex-independent manner much earlier than the start of canonical dosage compensation ( Figure S2 F).
We next investigated the consequences of maternal H4K16ac loss on transcription of X-linked zygotic genes by performing single-embryo RNA-seq in st5 males and females ( Figure S7 D). We found that the X chromosome displayed a similar extent of downregulation compared to the other chromosomes at st5 upon maternal MOF loss ( Figure S7 E). However, the zygotic genes proximal to HASs showed stronger downregulation relative to other zygotic genes ( Figure 7 D, left). These effects were not apparent in female embryos, suggesting a male-specific function of MOF within the “canonical” MSL complex at st5 ( Figure 7 D, right). We further observed increased H4K16ac enrichment on genes proximal to HASs compared to distal ones at st5 and later ( Figure S7 F). Thus, male X-linked genes in proximity to HASs show transcriptional sensitivity to MOF loss already at st5. This sex-specific effect indicates that the canonical dosage compensation process commences at st5 in WT animals, concomitant with MSL2 expression, but that its initiation is abrogated by maternal mof RNAi. Maternal MOF or MSL3 depletion ultimately resulted in adult male lethality ( Figures 7 E and S7 H). Since these animals were offspring of mutant mothers crossed with WT fathers, we conclude that zygotic expression of the MSLs is unable to trigger the onset of dosage compensation in the absence of maternal information.
We thus focused on older embryos (st15) to characterize the molecular consequences of maternal H4K16ac loss on dosage compensation. Complete loss of X chromosome H4K16ac enrichment occurred in st15 embryos after either MOF or MSL3 maternal depletion, consistent with our expectation that dosage compensation initiation would be compromised in these animals ( Figures 7 F, S7 I, and S7 K). Although embryonic expression of MSL complex members msl-1 , msl-2 , msl-3 , mle , and roXs commenced normally in male st15 embryos ( Figures S5 J and S7 G), embryonic mof levels were substantially decreased in both male and female late embryos following maternal mof RNAi ( Figure S5 J). Therefore, maternal depletion of msl-3 reflects the consequences of only maternal versus the combined maternal and zygotic loss of H4K16ac.
Given that maternal MSL3 loss leads to compromised H4K16ac levels in late embryos, despite the presence of MOF, we hypothesized that the loss of HAS accessibility at early stages in maternally H4K16ac-depleted embryos impairs X chromosome recognition by the MSL complex. Indeed, H4K16ac enrichment around HASs and HAS-proximal genes was lost in both maternal MOF- and MSL3-depleted embryos ( Figures 7 G and S7 J). This was concomitant with increased total histone H3 signal and disrupted nucleosome pattern ( Figures 7 G and S7 L) leading to compromised MSL1 targeting to the male X chromosome ( Figure 7 H). Expression analysis of these embryos showed misregulation on all X-linked genes and genes in proximity to HASs in particular ( Figures S7 E and S7G). These findings suggest that maternal MOF and MSL3 loss lead to disordered nucleosome organization around HASs in early and late embryos, thus impairing local MSL complex recruitment.
In contrast to maternal MOF loss, absence of somatic MOF (in S2 cells and larvae) leads to partial targeting of the MSL complex components MSL1 and MSL2 to the HASs on the X chromosome ( Figures 7 K) ( Alekseyenko et al., 2012; Alekseyenko et al., 2008; Buscaino et al., 2006; Straub et al., 2008 7. Alekseyenko, A.A. ∙ Peng, S. ∙ Larschan, E. ...

The chromosomal high-affinity binding sites for the Drosophila dosage compensation complex PLoS Genet. 2008; 4 :e1000302 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, no correlation between the distance of genes from HASs and the extent of their downregulation is observed upon somatic mof RNAi, unlike in germline mof RNAi (compare Figure 7 I with Figures 7 J and S7 M). These results reveal possible differences in MOF and H4K16ac contribution in the germline versus the soma.
Our data indicate that HASs located on the X chromosomes are among the H4K16ac-primed regions. The establishment of H4K16ac-mediated HAS nucleosome accessibility in early stages serves as the first and indispensable step towards the initiation of male X chromosome regulation. Dosage compensation is therefore set up earlier than previously anticipated and relies on H4K16ac intergenerational memory on dosage-compensated genes.

Section: Discussion

In this study we show that histone H4K16ac is intergenerationally retained from the maternal germline to the fertilized embryo. Maternal H4K16ac is important for gene activation in the progeny through its regulation of local nucleosome accessibility prior to transcriptional activation in vivo . Zygotic re-introduction of MOF failed to substitute its maternal function, indicating that this mark has an instructive role in early embryos.
MOF represents the major enzyme catalyzing H4K16ac ( Conrad et al., 2012; Feller et al., 2015 23. Conrad, T. ∙ Cavalli, F.M. ∙ Holz, H. ... The MOF chromobarrel domain controls genome-wide H4K16 acetylation and spreading of the MSL complex Dev. Cell. 2012; 22 :610-624 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar 27.

Cell. 2015; 57 :559-571 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that maternally provided MOF plays a dual role in “depositing” and “maintaining” H4K16ac. First, maternal MOF establishes H4K16ac in the maturing oocyte. Following fertilization, MOF exploits its unique ability to remain associated with mitotic chromosomes (this study and Ginno et al., 2018 32. Ginno, P.A. ∙ Burger, L. ∙ Seebacher, J. ... Cell cycle-resolved chromatin proteomics reveals the extent of mitotic preservation of the genomic regulatory landscape Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4048 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) in order to actively propagate H4K16ac, hence acting as the maintenance factor for H4K16ac during the first and subsequent embryonic divisions. Continuous presence of MOF is essential because histone acetylation marks typically exhibit fast turnover ( Alabert et al., 2015; Escobar et al., 2019; Waterborg and Kapros, 2002; Zee et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2013 6.

Commun. 2013; 4 :2203 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the proposed intergenerational H4K16ac transmission model is distinct from the mechanisms of inheritance of methylation marks, many of which rely on different catalytic modes for de novo deposition and propagation ( Campos et al., 2014 20. Campos, E.I. ∙ Stafford, J.M. ∙ Reinberg, D. Epigenetic inheritance: histone bookmarks across generations Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24 :664-674 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The combination of maternal deposition and early embryonic maintenance of the H4K16ac information is critical for marking genes prior to ZGA for future activation. Absence of this information leads to misregulation of H4K16ac targets and subsequently to increased embryonic lethality. Other acetyl histone marks were not able to restore proper gene expression in the absence of MOF, demonstrating a specific requirement for H4K16ac in oocytes. Furthermore, expression of the “maintaining” (zygotic) MOF upon ZGA cannot compensate for loss of the “depositing” (maternal) MOF function. It will be interesting to characterize the specificities of maternal and zygotic MOF and further explore whether genome structure, developmental timing, or other determinants affect the H4K16ac deposition pattern.
Maternally deposited H4K16ac primes a subset of genes for subsequent transcriptional activation upon the onset of ZGA and later in development. The transcription factor Zelda is responsible for activation of the first zygotic transcripts ( Harrison et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2008; Schulz et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015 36.

Zelda overcomes the high intrinsic nucleosome barrier at enhancers during Drosophila zygotic genome activation Genome Res. 2015; 25 :1703-1714 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, neither Zelda-mediated transcription nor the chromatin marks around these Zelda-dependent regions explain the global emergence of chromatin accessibility in early embryos ( Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016; Chen et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014 15. Blythe, S.A. ∙ Wieschaus, E.F.

Establishment of regions of genomic activity during the Drosophila maternal to zygotic transition eLife. 2014; 3 :e03737 Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar ). Our data indicate that the establishment of H4K16ac-mediated nucleosome accessibility on numerous Zelda-independent promoters before ZGA creates a permissive chromatin state that enhances RNA Pol II recruitment and facilitates gene expression activation.
Maternal depletion of MOF also led to profound chromatin architecture changes. Even though the structure of TAD boundaries remained unaffected, we observed substantial defects in compartmentalization during ZGA. Analysis of Hi-C datasets from Drosophila st5 embryos whose transcription was abrogated by drug treatment ( Hug et al., 2017 40. Hug, C.B. ∙ Grimaldi, A.G. ∙ Kruse, K. ... Chromatin Architecture Emerges during Zygotic Genome Activation Independent of Transcription Cell. 2017; 169 :216-228.e.19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed similar phenotypes to those we observed in embryos after maternal H4K16ac loss ( Figures S4 M and S4N). However, the compartmentalization defects in maternal mof RNAi offspring were apparent only in early and not late embryos, despite persistent transcription misregulation at both stages. Thus, an aberrant transcriptional program is not the primary driving force for the genome compartmentalization defects observed upon H4K16ac loss early on. We conclude that although maternal H4K16ac contributes toward establishing global genome organization early on, other factors can compensate for this loss at later embryonic stages.
The “future” dosage compensated genes on the X chromosome are among the numerous targets that show H4K16ac signal prior to the onset of their transcription. By characterizing the developmental dynamics of H4K16ac, we describe the sequence of events that leads to establishment of dosage compensation on the male X chromosome. H4K16ac decorates all chromosomes prior to ZGA but becomes strongly enriched on the male X chromosome during later stages. We propose that initiation of dosage compensation at both X-linked genes and HASs relies on the instructive H4K16ac signal from the mother. Without maternal H4K16ac, MSL complex targeting is compromised in males and the mature dosage-compensated phase cannot be reached. Thus, the X chromosome serves as a readout of H4K16ac memory on a chromosomal scale.
H4K16ac is deposited in oocytes by a maternal MSL sub-complex composed of MSL1, MOF, and MSL3. This first step prepares the chromatin landscape for establishment of nucleosome accessibility and dosage compensation initiation in a sex-independent manner. Assembly of the canonical MSL complex requires the expression of the male-specific protein MSL2, whose expression starts at st5. We observed that MSL2 targets the X chromosome at ZGA and together with MOF mediates transcriptional activation of genes close to HASs in a male-specific manner. Interestingly though, no MSL complex “spreading” in the vicinity of HASs is observed at this stage. Because X-chromosome territory formation coincides with the expression of the roX2 long non-coding RNA, it is possible that efficient MSL complex spreading is mediated by the contribution of roX2 /MSL interactions. Thus, the MSL complex targeting and spreading on the X chromosome represent two temporally discrete steps with distinct requirements ( Meller, 2003 56. Meller, V.H. Initiation of dosage compensation in Drosophila embryos depends on expression of the roX RNAs Mech. Dev. 2003; 120 :759-767 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the three-dimensional organization of HASs may function as an additional stabilizing factor for X-territory maturation ( Ramírez et al., 2015 65. Ramírez, F. ∙ Lingg, T. ∙ Toscano, S. ... High-Affinity Sites Form an Interaction Network to Facilitate Spreading of the MSL Complex across the X Chromosome in Drosophila Mol. Cell. 2015; 60 :146-162 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we observed that interactions between HASs were more abundant in st15 compared to st5 embryos ( Figure S7 N), possibly because of the stronger chromatin compartmentalization in late embryos ( Ogiyama et al., 2018 60. Ogiyama, Y. ∙ Schuettengruber, B. ∙ Papadopoulos, G.L. ... Polycomb-Dependent Chromatin Looping Contributes to Gene Silencing during Drosophila Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :73-88.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore possible that maturation of the active compartment is required for the stronger clustering of HASs.
Although the dosage compensation defects represent a clear readout of the importance of maternal H4K16ac, the influence of this early mark is not restricted to male progeny. Furthermore, we found the H4K16ac marking of the oocyte to be evolutionarily conserved in three Drosophila species ( Drosophila melanogaster , D. virilis , and D. busckii ) as well as in mammals. Given that mammals have a different dosage compensation mechanism, retention of H4K16ac in the early mammalian zygote likely indicates the importance of this histone modification in embryogenesis.
Maternal inheritance of H3K27me3 mediates gene silencing in both Drosophila and mammals ( Inoue et al., 2017; Zenk et al., 2017 43. Inoue, A. ∙ Jiang, L. ∙ Lu, F. ...

However, these modifications are absent from the young Drosophila zygotes ( Tweedie et al., 1997; Ulianov et al., 2016; Zenk et al., 2017 85. Tweedie, S. ∙ Charlton, J. ∙ Clark, V. ...

A variety of mechanisms have thus evolved to propagate instructions to the next generation via histone modifications in the germline.

Differential H4 acetylation of paternal and maternal chromatin precedes DNA replication and differential transcriptional activity in pronuclei of 1-cell mouse embryos Development. 1997; 124 :4615-4625 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We set the PN0 to embryos immediately after fertilization and PN5 refers to embryos with large pronuclei located centrally within the embryo. We cultured zygotes in vitro to 2-cell stage using standard conditions. Briefly zygotes were flushed from oviducts in M2 media (Merck), briefly washed in KOSM and allowed to grow overnight in 5% CO2 equilibrated droplets of KOSM (Cosmobio).
The knockdown of maternally provided mRNAs was achieved by crossing UAS-shRNA females with mat-a-tubGal4 (Bloomington Stock number #7062 or #7063) males. The female progeny was fertilized by their male siblings (unless stated otherwise) and laid eggs depleted from the desired target gene.
For hatching rate determination 0-1hr old embryos were collected and 100 randomly picked embryos were arrayed in an apple juice-agar petri dish in groups of 10. After 30hr at 25°C, the unhatched embryos were counted for each group in three independent experiments.
“12xHisGu-H4wt” ( H istone 4 w ild t ype) refers to a Bac-based transgene consisting of 12 copies of the histone repeat unit containing all five replication-dependent histone genes inserted in an attP docking site at position 65B2 on chromosome arm 3L. “12xHisGu-H4wt” is sufficient to rescue the lethality caused by a loss-of-function mutant lacking all 23 canonical histone repeat units of the endogenous locus at 2L (ΔHisC) as well as the non-canonical single His4r gene at 3R (ΔHis4r) ( Armstrong et al., 2018; Günesdogan et al., 2010; McKay et al., 2015 10.

ΔHis4r represents a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated null mutant allele of His4r ( His4r 15-4 ) ( Armstrong et al., 2018 10. Armstrong, R.L. ∙ Penke, T.J.R. ∙ Strahl, B.D. ...

To determine the viability of males and females carrying 24 copies of the H4K16R transgene shown in Figure 6 E , which carry maternally deposited mRNAs encoding wild type H4 but lack its zygotic expression as well as lacking both maternal and zygotic His4r expression, we set 10 crosses with 5 males and 5 females of the following genotype: yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ CyO; 12xH4K16R, ΔHis4r and allowed them to develop at 25°C. The progeny of these crosses was counted upon eclosion daily for a period of 10 days. The female siblings expressing both maternal and zygotic H4 from the endogenous locus HisC (mat+zyg+) = yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ CyO; 12xH4K16R, ΔHis4r were used as an internal control with 100% viability. The viability of the HisC (mat+zyg-) = yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP; 12xH4K16R, ΔHis4r females as well as the viability of the males of both genotypes was calculated as % relative to the internal control.
To determine the viability of males and females carrying 12 copies of the H4K16R or H4wt transgene shown in Figures S6 B and S6C, yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ CyO; 12xH4K16R, ΔHis4r/ TM6Tb or yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ CyO; 12xH4wt, ΔHis4r/ TM6Tb female flies were crossed with yw; ΔHisC, twi-Gal4/ CyO; ΔHis4r males in 15 separate vials and were allowed to develop at 25°C. The female siblings expressing both maternal and zygotic H4 from the endogenous locus HisC (mat+zyg+) = yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ CyO; 12xH4K16R or 12x H4wt, ΔHis4r were used as an internal control with 100% viability.
A common marker of reproductive success in Drosophila is fecundity, which is experimentally measured as the number of eggs laid. In Figure 6 F to compare the fecundity of the HisC (mat+zyg+) - ( yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ CyO; 12xH4K16R, ΔHis4r) and HisC (mat+zyg-) - ( yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP; 12xH4K16R, ΔHis4r) females, independent crosses were set up, each consisting of one female and two WOR males. The flies were allowed to lay eggs in vials on standard food. After 3 days they were transferred into fresh vials for 3-4 consecutive days and the number of eggs laid per 24hr was counted daily.
To analyze effects of H4K16ac on female fecundity we compared females expressing either H4wt or H4K16R in the absence of endogenous zygotic H4. yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ CyO; 12xH4K16R, ΔHis4r/ TM6Tb and yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ CyO; 12xH4wt, ΔHis4r/ TM6Tb female flies were crossed with yw; ΔHisC, twi-Gal4/ CyO; ΔHis4r males to obtain individual virgin yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ ΔHisC, twi-Gal4; 12xH4K16R, ΔHis4r/ ΔHis4r females, as well as yw; ΔHisC, UAS-2xEYFP/ ΔHisC, twi-Gal4; 12xH4wt, ΔHis4r/ ΔHis4r females that were crossed with 2 Oregon R males in 15 separate vials and the egg laying counted as above.
Two gRNAs targeting mof were cloned by annealing two phosphorylated complementary oligos (gRNA1.F: CTTC CGTCAGCGGCTCGGATCAGT, gRNA1.R: CTTC CGACCTCAGCGGTGTCCAAG, gRNA2.F: AAAC CTTGGACACCGCTGAGGTCG and gRNA2.R: AAAC CTTGGACACCGCTGAGGTCG) into the BbsI site of pBFv-U6.2B vector (Flybase FBmc0003128) after annealing at 65°C for 15min. A sequence of 1181bp containing 369bp upstream and 751bp downstream the first nucleotide of mof CDS, together with the FLAG-HA sequence preceding mof CDS, was cloned into pJET1.2 vector and used as a homologous recombination donor.
nos-Cas9.TH00787.N embryos were injected with a mix containing 75ng/μl of two gRNAs and 100ng/μl of donor plasmid. The female injected flies were individually crossed to w 11 1 8 Oregon R males. Ten individual male progenies from each cross were crossed with FM7, GFP females and after 4 days used for genomic DNA isolation and PCR screening for FLAG-HA tag presence. Tag incorporation was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing and western blot detection of the FLAG epitope.
Virgin females ( yw mof 2 FRT19A/ FM7, Act-GFP) ( Copur et al., 2018 24. Copur, Ö. ∙ Gorchakov, A. ∙ Finkl, K. ...

The progeny of this cross (F1) was subjected to heat-shock induced FLP/FRT-mediated site directed recombination. The expression of FLP was induced by heat shocking F1 three times for 2hr at 37°C during 3 consecutive days, starting at 2nd larval stage. This resulted in females with ovaries composed exclusively of cells homozygous for the mof 2 mutation in otherwise heterozygous background. The progeny of these females lack wild type maternal mof transcripts. For Figure 6 B virgin F1 females were mated to either WT , twiGal4; UAS-ha-mof ( Bloomington stock #80574 and P [w+,UAS-ha-mof] ( Conrad et al., 2012 23. Conrad, T. ∙ Cavalli, F.M. ∙ Holz, H. ...

As a control we used females y w 11 1 8 P[ry+7.2=neoFRT]19A ( Bloomington stock #1744) crossed to males ovoD1 yw sn hsFLP FRT19A/ C(1) that caused no substantial decrease in progeny viability.
100 ovary pairs from FLAG-HA-MOF or w 11 1 8 Oregon R flies were dissected and transferred to ice-cold PBS. The ovaries were resuspended in 1ml ovary protein lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 2mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT, 0.2% NP-40 and 1x Protease inhibitors - cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche #05056489001) and homogenized with 20 strokes with a douncer using the tight pestle. The homogenate was transferred to 1.5ml low-retention Eppendorf tubes and incubated on ice for 15min with occasional inversion. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 5min at 16,000 g . 20μl of anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich #M8823) diluted to 1:5 with beads buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl) were added to each cleared lysate. Samples were incubated for 3hr at 4°C with rotation and subsequently washed 4 times for 10min each in ovary protein lysis buffer followed by six quick rinses in co-immunoprecipitation wash buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 2mM MgCl 2 ). Protein elution from beads was performed by adding 2x Laemmli buffer (ROTH #K929.1) and incubation at 95°C for 5min.
Newly eclosed flies of the desired genotype were allowed to mate for 2 days and then transferred to fly cages. The embryo collections started after 3 consecutive pre-lays of 1hr each. The embryos of the desired age were collected with the help of a sieve under running water and were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until further use.
For the preparation of whole cell extracts, 200μl of frozen embryos were homogenized in 1.8ml lysis buffer (50mM Tris-Cl, 2mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 150mM NaCl, PMSF, cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche #05056489001) using a glass douncer with 20-25 strokes. The lysate was centrifuged for 5min at 20,000rcf at 4°C. The supernatant was re-centrifuged for 5 more minutes to avoid any fat contaminants. The protein concentration of the lysate was quantified by Qbit and further pre-cleared by the addition of 25μl protein A/G beads and rotation for 1hr at 4°C. For the FLAG IP, 10μl of FLAG M2 magnetic bead slurry (Sigma-Aldrich M8823) were used per mg of sample followed by a 3hr incubation rotating at 4°C. After washing the beads 3 times for 15min with Lysis Buffer, 2x Laemmli buffer (ROTH) was added and the samples were boiled at 95°C for 5min.
Embryos were homogenized in 2x Laemmli Buffer (ROTH) using a micropestle. After incubation at 95°C for 5min, the samples were loaded for SDS-PAGE using homemade or NuPAGE precasted gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific #NP0321BOX) and ran in 1x NuPAGE™ MOPS or MES SDS Running Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific#NP0001 and #NP0002 respectively).
The proteins were transferred using wet transfer to 0.22μm PVDF membrane (Roche #03010040001). The membrane was blocked using 5% BSA, 0.3% Tween-20 in 1x PBS, incubated with primary antibody O/N at 4°C and washed 3 times with PBS, 0.3% Tween-20 for 15min before incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature (RT). After three 5min washes with PBS, 0.3% Tween-20, Western blotting substrate (Lumilight-plus Roche #12015196001 or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate Thermo Fisher Scientific #34096) was used to image proteins with ChemiDoc XRS+ (Bio-Rad).
Fixation and immunostaining were performed as previously described ( Zenk et al., 2017 95. Zenk, F. ∙ Loeser, E. ∙ Schiavo, R. ... Germ line-inherited H3K27me3 restricts enhancer function during maternal-to-zygotic transition Science. 2017; 357 :212-216 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). For histone modification staining we used methanol fixation, whereas for transcription factors 4% formaldehyde fixation. Briefly, embryos were aged at 25 °C until they reached the desired developmental stage. After dechorionation using 50% bleach, embryos were fixed in a mix containing equal volumes of heptane and 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20min under vigorous shaking at RT. This step was skipped when aiming for histone modification immunostaining. The formaldehyde solution was removed and methanol was added to the heptane solution in equal volume. Intense shaking for 40sec leads to the dissociation of the vitelline membrane and further fixation. The embryos that sank after shaking were collected and rinsed three times with methanol to remove any traces of formaldehyde. The embryos were then re-hydrated using PBS-0.1% Triton solution for 15 min three consecutive times. Blocking was achieved by incubation with PBS- Triton 0.1% supplemented with 0.2% BSA for 30min. The fly strains and the antibodies used are listed in the Key Resources Table . The microscopy imaging was done using a Confocal Leica SP5, a Zeiss LSM 780 Confocal or a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan microscope. The image processing was done using the software FIJI or the Zen Blue and Black software.
Ovaries from were isolated from FVB females 48hr post injection with 7.5IU PMSG. The tissue was washed briefly in PBS and crosslinked 2hr at RT in 4% PFA/PBS. After dehydration in Ethanol/PBS and Histolemon series, the PFA-fixed ovaries were incubated in paraffin for 3hr at 58°C and casted into molds covered with paraffin. Blocks were sectioned using an RM2155 microtome (Leica) at 5–7μm. After rehydration of the tissue, the slides were boiled at 95 ±1°C for 20min in 40mM Tris-HCl/ 64mM EDTA pH=9.0. Specimens were incubated in 1% BSA/PBS for 30min followed by overnight incubation with the primary antibody in 0.05% BSA/PBS. After brief rinse the slides were washed twice in PBS and once in PBS-T (PBS- 0.2% Tween). Next, they were incubated for 1hr with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa-488 and Alexa-594 in presence of DAPI. Embryos were finally mounted on slides using Prolong Gold antifade (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The acquisition of microscopy images was done with a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope.
MI and MII oocytes and embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10min at RT, washed in PBT (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), permeabilized in PBS - 0.25% Triton X-100, washed in PBT three times for 5min, blocked in PBT +1% BSA for 30min and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. After three 15min washes with PBT solution, the oocytes and embryos were incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody, washed again in PBT 3 times for 15min and counterstained in Prolong Gold Antifade with DAPI. The acquisition of microscopy images was done with a Zeiss LSM780 or LSM880 confocal microscope.
Single or multiple embryos were homogenized in TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher #15596026) using a micropestle. Total RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA Microprep or Miniprep RNA extraction kit (Zymo Research #R2062 and #R2052) respectively following the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was created using the GoScript Reverse Transcription System (Promega #A5001). Reactions for qPCR were set using the FastStart Universal SYBR Green 2x master mix (Roche #049139140001) and run either on a Roche LightCycler II or an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The qPCR results were analyzed and plotted using Graphpad Prism. For RNA sequencing, the quality of the isolated RNA was checked by AATI Fragment Analyzer and polyA library was made using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit.

Commun. 2018; 9 :3626 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, 1hr embryo collections were aged at 25 °C until they reached the desired developmental stage. After dechorionation using 50% bleach, the embryos were fixed in a mix containing equal volumes of heptane and 1% formaldehyde in Buffer A (60mM KCl, 15mM NaCl, 15mM HEPES pH 7.6, 4mM MgCl2) for 15min under vigorous shaking at RT. Crosslinking was quenched by adding glycine to final concentration of 0.25M and rotating for 5min. Heptane and fixing solution were removed and the embryos were permeabilized using Buffer A + 0.1% Triton for 10min at RT. Any residual heptane was removed by three more washes with Buffer A + 0.1% Triton for 10min at RT. Finally, embryos were hand-staged based on their morphology under the stereoscope using a cooling station, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further use.
For nuclei dissociation, frozen embryos were resuspended in Buffer A + (0.5% Triton-X, 0.05% DTT, 10mM Sodium Butyrate and 1x protease inhibitors) and were briefly sonicated using the Covaris E220 for 45-90 sec (peak power 75W, duty factor 10%, cycles burst 200). For later-stage embryos we extended the sonication to 2min. The nuclei were filtered using 30μm pore filter (CellTrics® 30μm, Sysmex #0400422316) and were washed twice with Buffer A. Next, the nuclei were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl 2 , 1mM CaCl 2 , 10mM NaCl, 0.25M sucrose, 1% Triton and 1x protease inhibitors) and incubated at 4°C for 1hr. Chromatin shearing was achieved using Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase, NEB #M024S) at 37°C under shaking conditions. For each experiment the MNase quantity was adjusted to the volume of embryos and the developmental stage. The number of embryos was estimated based on the initial volume of intact embryos prior to Covaris sonication.15μl of dechorionated embryos correspond to 1,000 - 1,500 embryos. For H4K16ac ChIP-seq we used the following amounts of MNase: 35U for 40μl st3-4 embryos, 50U for 15μl st5 embryos, 75U for 15μl st7 embryos, 40U for 100 st15 embryos. For Pol II ChIP-seq we used 10U of MNase for 20μl of st5 embryos. After 15min the MNase digestion was stopped by addition of 10% volume of MNase stop buffer (4M NaCl, 200mM EDTA) and a brief sonication using Bioruptor® pico (10 cycles, 30 sec ON - 30 sec OFF) was performed. After centrifugation at 16,000 g at 4°C the supernatant containing the digested chromatin was collected. Small fraction of chromatin was de-crosslinked and after RNase A and Proteinase K treatment, it was purified using phenol-chloroform and isopropanol-precipitated to check the MNase digestion pattern by AATI Fragment Analyzer. Immunoprecipitation using 1μl of antibody was performed O/N at 4°C, followed by 3hr incubation with magnetic protein A/G beads (Thermo Fisher) and three 15min washes in RIPA Buffer and two rinses with TE 0.1X. After DNA isolation using phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was submitted for library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra II kit (NEB #E7645) according to the instructions of manufacturer’s using 12-14 PCR cycles of amplification. To retain the short genomic fragments after adaptor ligation the library was purified twice using 1.6x - 1.9x AMPure XP beads.
D. melanogaster dechorionated embryos were fixed using 1% formaldehyde for 15min at RT. 25 or 100 embryos were hand staged based on morphology for cycle 9-13 or mid nuclear cycle 14 corresponding to st3-4 and st5 respectively. Nuclei isolation was used as for ChIP using Covaris sonication and nuclei filtering to isolate pure nuclei. Nuclei pellet was dissolved in 50μl of cold buffer containing 10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 15mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1% NP-40 and a 10min centrifugation at 500 g followed. Further processing for ATAC-seq was adapted from ( Buenrostro et al., 2013; Buenrostro et al., 2015 16. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Giresi, P.G. ∙ Zaba, L.C. ...

Briefly, the nuclei pellet was resuspended in Tn5 Reaction mix containing 2.5μl of Tn5 from the Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina cat. No 15027987), 25μl Buffer 2x and 22.5μl H 2 O. The tagmentation reaction took place at 37°C shaking at 800rpm. After precisely 30min, the samples were placed on ice and 250μl of PB buffer from the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (cat. No 28004) was added to stop the reaction. DNA purification was followed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Pure DNA was amplified using 12 PCR cycles using the NebNext Polymerase (M0541S) for the library amplification.
D. melanogaster dechorionated embryos were fixed using 1.8% formaldehyde for 15 min at RT. 50-100 embryos were hand staged based on morphology for the late embryonic stage 15 (14-16hr AEL) or the mid-nuclear cycle 14 stage. The latter stage contains nuclei purely in S phase. The next mitosis takes place during gastrulation ( Yuan et al., 2016 93. Yuan, K. ∙ Seller, C.A. ∙ Shermoen, A.W. ...

High-resolution TADs reveal DNA sequences underlying genome organization in flies Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :189 Crossref Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar except for the following modifications: nuclei were digested for 3hr in total using 2μl DpnII (NEB, R0543M, 150U/ sample), half of enzyme amount added after 1.5hr. During ligation, the ligase (T4 DNA ligase, NEB 0202S) was also added in two steps. DNA purification was performed using the Zymo ChIP DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (D5205). To increase the fraction of valid Hi-C reads, dangling ends were removed using 3U of T4 DNA polymerase for 30min at 20°C with addition of 100μM dGTP and dATP. After biotin pull-down, all DNA bound to beads was used for library preparation and libraries were sequenced paired-end, with a read length of 75bp.
dsRNAs against mof or gfp were prepared according to the DRSC protocol ( https://www.flyrnai.org/DRSC-PRS.html ) via standard T7 in vitro transcription of DNA template using the HiScribe™ T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB E2040S) and the oligos listed in Table S1 . We used 10ug of dsRNA per 1 million cells and incubated them at 25 o for 3 days.
Post-sequencing our data, or previously published datasets were processed using the DNA-mapping pipeline described in ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 13.

For histone or histone modification ChIP-seq a minimum fragment length of 140bp was applied for the coverage files, as the ChIP samples were generated using MNase digestion. For RNA Pol II ChIP-seq no threshold in fragment length was used. For the identification of H4K16ac-positive TSSs, as promoters can be nucleosome-free, we used the MACS2-called narrow peaks and intersected them with a bed file containing all TSSs + 150bp to capture the first nucleosome of bound genes. For the identification of Pol II-bound TSSs, we intersected narrow peaks with the exact position of all TSSs. For the identification of H4K16ac domains we used the EDD caller ( Lund et al., 2014 54. Lund, E. ∙ Oldenburg, A.R. ∙ Collas, P. Enriched domain detector: a program for detection of wide genomic enrichment domains robust against local variations Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :e92 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ) with an FDR of 0.05 to call enriched domains compared to Input samples. The bam files were used for this analysis. Note: For all the figures presented in the manuscript, the merged file of biological replicates was used. The exceptions are the st15 H4K16ac and H3 control and msl-3 RNAi. In this case, the control RNAi replicate 3 and msl-3 RNAi replicate 2 ChIPs were performed at a later timepoint compared to the control RNAi replicates 1 & 2 and msl-3 RNAi replicate 1. Even though the replicates look qualitatively similar, they display distinct enrichment intensities due to different IP efficiency. Thus, the samples control RNAi replicate 1 & 2 and msl-3 RNAi replicate 1 were used for figure generation, so that they can be fairly compared to mof RNAi which was generated within the same experimental batch.
We analyzed previously published datasets from poly-A RNA-seq derived from unfertilized eggs ( Paris et al., 2015 61. Paris, M. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ∙ Eisen, M.B. ... Sex Bias and Maternal Contribution to Gene Expression Divergence in Drosophila Blastoderm Embryos PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1005592 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the RNA-seq pipeline by snakePipes ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 13. Bhardwaj, V. ∙ Heyne, S. ∙ Sikora, K. ... snakePipes: facilitating flexible, scalable and integrative epigenomic analysis Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :4757-4759 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next compared the expression of Unfertilized egg with our st5 RNA-seq using DESeq2 to retrieve the normalized counts. We called “maternal” the transcripts that were expressed with minimum 100 counts in unfertilized egg RNA-seq. We then used the rest as “zygotic”. Non-poly-A RNA such as histone mRNAs, ribosomal RNAs and snRNAs were excluded from the analysis. We cross-checked our classification with the SNP-based gene classification ( Lott et al., 2011 52. Lott, S.E. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ∙ Schroth, G.P. ... Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1000590 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). The majority of H4K16ac-positive maternal genes were also scored from Lott et al., 2011 52. Lott, S.E. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ∙ Schroth, G.P. ... Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1000590 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar as solely maternal (n = 3,000), with only 21.6% being “maternal and zygotic” genes (n = 648). Furthermore, we chose to proceed with this binary method of classification as many of the X-linked genes were unclassified and thus excluded in Lott et al., 2011 52. Lott, S.E. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ∙ Schroth, G.P. ... Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1000590 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar .
Processing of ATAC-seq datasets was done following the DNA-mapping pipeline described in snakePipes ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 13. Bhardwaj, V. ∙ Heyne, S. ∙ Sikora, K. ... snakePipes: facilitating flexible, scalable and integrative epigenomic analysis Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :4757-4759 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly the adaptors were trimmed from the reads using trimGalore2 following the filtering for uniquely mapped reads and the removal of duplicates. Bowtie2 software was used for mapping using default parameters. Furthermore, the ATAC-seq pipeline from the same tool ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 13. Bhardwaj, V. ∙ Heyne, S. ∙ Sikora, K. ... snakePipes: facilitating flexible, scalable and integrative epigenomic analysis Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :4757-4759 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ) was applied for open chromatin peak calling using MACS2 tools and differential peak identification using CSAW ( mof vs control RNAi absolute log2 fold change> 0.5 & FDR< 0.1). 1x normalization was used for the generation of coverage files setting a maximum fragment length of 150bp and excluding the X chromosome from the normalization factor calculation using the bamCoverage tool from deeptools.
Processing of RNA-seq datasets was done following the pipeline snakePipes-1.1.2 ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 13. Bhardwaj, V. ∙ Heyne, S. ∙ Sikora, K. ... snakePipes: facilitating flexible, scalable and integrative epigenomic analysis Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :4757-4759 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the mapping software STAR, trimming of the reads with trimGalore, dm6 as reference genome and Ensembl release-79 as transcriptome. The retrieved gene counts were used for DESeq2 analysis ( Love et al., 2014 53. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ) ran in the R studio interface. Differentially expressed genes were selected using minimum threshold of 0.5 in absolute log2 fold change and adjusted p value of 0.05.
Hi-C data processing was performed using the Hi-C pipeline of snakePipes ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 13. Bhardwaj, V. ∙ Heyne, S. ∙ Sikora, K. ... snakePipes: facilitating flexible, scalable and integrative epigenomic analysis Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :4757-4759 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ) and HiCExplorer v2.3 ( Ramírez et al., 2018; Wolff et al., 2018 67. Ramírez, F. ∙ Bhardwaj, V. ∙ Arrigoni, L. ... High-resolution TADs reveal DNA sequences underlying genome organization in flies Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :189 Crossref Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar 90. Wolff, J. ∙ Bhardwaj, V. ∙ Nothjunge, S. ... Galaxy HiCExplorer: a web server for reproducible Hi-C data analysis, quality control and visualization Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W11-W16 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). Forward and reverse reads were mapped separately using bwa-mem with the following parameters: ` -A1 -B4 -E50 -L0 ` with the following samtools command ` samtools view -Shb `. Hi-C matrices were built at a resolution of 2.5kb with a fixed bin size using HiCExplorer ` hicBuildMatrix -bs 2500 ` with the sequence recognized by DpnII. The different biological and sequencing replicates were merged in one Hi-C matrix per condition (control or mof RNAi) using `hicSumMarices` . Iterative correction (ICE) was applied on these merged matrices using `hicCorrectMatrix` following the SnakePipes Hi-C pipeline. Conversion from h5 to cool format was then performed with `hicConvertFormat` for further use in cooltools (described below). Published data from ( Hug et al., 2017 40. Hug, C.B. ∙ Grimaldi, A.G. ∙ Kruse, K. ... Chromatin Architecture Emerges during Zygotic Genome Activation Independent of Transcription Cell. 2017; 169 :216-228.e.19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ) were analyzed the same way. Hi-C matrices visualisation were performed using `hicPlotMatrix` or ` pyGenomeTracks ` for the indicated regions. TADs were called using ` hicCallTADs --minDepth 7500 --maxDepth 100000 --step 2500 --correctForMultipleTesting fdr --thresholdComparisons 0.09 --delta 0.01 -p 100 `. That way, we obtained the TAD boundary positions and genome-wide TAD insulation scores. TADs positioning was compared between conditions by extending TAD boundaries by 2.5kb with `bedtools slop -b 2500` and by subsequently using `bedtools fisher` . The log2ratio matrix displayed in Figure S4 K was obtained using `hicCompareMatrices –operation log2ratio` . The Pearson matrices in Figure S4 L were computed using `hicPCA -noe 1 --pearsonMatrix -norm` in HiCExplorer 2.1.1. Contacts curves plotting was performed using `hicPlotDistVsCounts --maxdepth 12000000` on matrices that had been restricted to regions stored in a BED file (A to A, B to B, A to B, H4K16ac domains to H4K16ac domains) by using `hicAdjustMatrix --regions` . Contacts aggregation displayed in Figure S7 N was performed with `hicAggregateContacts --range 800000:8000000 --numberOfBins 30 --avgType mean --plotType 2d --chromosomes X --regionReferencePosition center --vMin 0.7 --vMax 1.40` on matrices at 5kb resolution. The latter were obtained by using `hicMergeBins -nb 2` on uncorrected matrices, subsequently corrected using `hicCorrectMatrix` as described before. Definition of A and B compartment was not performed in the standard way because of the low compartmentalization of st5 embryos and is thus described in a dedicated section below.
Compartment profiles, i.e. a score that can be used to segment the genome into two types of segments, A-type and B-type, such that interactions between loci of the same type (AA or BB) are more frequent than interactions of loci of different types (AB), can be computed using eigenvector (EV) decomposition of contact matrices, see for example ( Fudenberg et al., 2016 30. Fudenberg, G. ∙ Imakaev, M. ∙ Lu, C. ... Formation of Chromosomal Domains by Loop Extrusion Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :2038-2049 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1155) PubMed Google Scholar ). St5 embryo contact maps show a strong signature of centromeres because of a lack of general compartmentalization. A naive EV decomposition thus mainly picks up this difference between centromeric and non-centromeric regions. To avoid this, and to rather pick up the compartmentalization in active and inactive sections, we used visual inspection of the Hi-C map to find regions where the centromeric signature can be ignored and used only non-centromeric regions for further analysis. Specifically, our valid chromosomal regions are: 2L: 0-21,500,000, 2R: 6,300,000-25,286,936; 3L: 0-23,000,000; 3R: 4,200,000-32,079,331; X: 0-23,542,271.
We noticed that in our Hi-C maps at moderate genomic separations (∼5-10 Mb) a compartmental signal was still quite visible as a checkerboard pattern. This pattern is largely absent at genomic separations approaching the size of the valid chromosomal regions. This results in an effect that we have not consistently observed in other Hi-C data: While compartment profiles can be reliably computed by EV decomposition on subsections of the Hi-C map, such computations fail when using the entire valid chromosomal regions, certainly reflecting the weak chromatin compartmentalization in st5 embryos. We thus used a procedure of EV decomposition on smaller windows and subsequent patching to obtain a consensus compartment profile as described below. To patch together a consensus compartmental profile in the entire valid genomic region from smaller windows we proceed as follows. We choose a window size w . We also choose a “quality criterion” for EVs in the windows. We then walk along a valid chromosomal region in steps as follows: (i) Choose windows ( a,a+w ) where w is the window size and a is the starting position of the window which is stepped from the beginning of the valid chromosomal region in steps of 1Mb as long as the window still fits inside the valid chromosomal region (a last window is added that terminates exactly at the end of the valid chromosomal region). (ii) The EV in each window is computed using eigenvector decomposition from cooltools ( https://github.com/mirnylab/cooltools ) on iteratively corrected matrices ( Imakaev et al., 2012 42. Imakaev, M. ∙ Fudenberg, G. ∙ McCord, R.P. ... Iterative correction of Hi-C data reveals hallmarks of chromosome organization Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :999-1003 Crossref Scopus (869) PubMed Google Scholar ) that were corrected for the average decay of contact probability with genomic separation ( Imakaev et al., 2012 42. Imakaev, M. ∙ Fudenberg, G. ∙ McCord, R.P. ... Iterative correction of Hi-C data reveals hallmarks of chromosome organization Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :999-1003 Crossref Scopus (869) PubMed Google Scholar ) that were corrected for the average decay of contact probability with genomic separation (i.e. we used “observed over expected” Hi-C matrices), and the genomic GC content was used to flip EVs such that negative values preferentially correlate with low GC content (inactive compartmental segments). The correct orientation of the EV such as positive values correspond to the active compartment and negative values correspond to the inactive compartment was verified using the ATAC-seq and H4K16ac ChIP-seq signals ( Figure S4 H).
The used “quality criterion” was that the mean absolute deviation from the median of the first EV exceeds the mean of the of the mean absolute deviations of the medians of the second and third EVs by some factor, EV_threshold . This rewards bimodal EVs and is chosen because a compartment track is, ideally, very bimodal (namely jumping between 1 and -1). The above procedure is repeated for a number of window sizes ( w = 2Mb, 3Mb, 5Mb, 7Mb, 10Mb, 15Mb, and a window as long as the valid genomic region) and a number of values for EV_threshold . Our goal is now to find values w and EV_threshold that are optimal in the following sense: (i) The window EV should be consistent between windows in the regions where windows overlap: i.e. the mean standard deviation between different window EV in overlapping regions should be small. (ii) As much as possible of the valid chromosomal region should be covered with EVs that pass the quality criterion. We thus sweep the window size w and quality parameter EV_threshold . We manually select a combination of w and EV_threshold that minimizes the mean standard deviation of EVs in overlapping regions and maximized the coverage. Finally, we compute a consensus compartmental profile as follows. (i) At genomic positions where one or more window EVs that passed the quality criterion are available we use their mean. (ii) Where no such EV is available, we don’t assign a numeric value to the consensus compartmental profile.
By the term “compartmentalization” we refer to the formation of spatial compartments in the sense that Hi-C contacts between loci of the same type (AA and BB contacts) are more frequent than between loci of different types (AB contacts). Here, the “types” are inferred from compartment profiles (i.e. from eigenvectors, as described above). To quantify compartmentalization, we use two different methods. First, we use a score that measures the enhancement of AA and BB contacts over AB contacts for each genomic separation separately, as described in the SI of ( Nuebler et al., 2018 59. Nuebler, J. ∙ Fudenberg, G. ∙ Imakaev, M. ... Chromatin organization by an interplay of loop extrusion and compartmental segregation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E6697-E6706 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). This has the advantage that the decay of contact probability with increasing genomic separation (“scaling”) is removed automatically. Differently from ( Nuebler et al., 2018 59. Nuebler, J. ∙ Fudenberg, G. ∙ Imakaev, M. ... Chromatin organization by an interplay of loop extrusion and compartmental segregation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E6697-E6706 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ), however, we here do not average the obtained score over genomic separations, but rather show the degree of compartmentalization as a function of genomic separation. As a second means to quantify compartmentalization we use “saddle plots”: rows and columns of a Hi-C matrix are reordered by increasing value of the compartment profile. This places BB contacts in the top left corner and AA contacts in the lower right corner, while AB contacts are found in the lower left and top right corners. To measure the degree compartmentalization, we aggregate the 33% strongest AA and BB contacts and 33% strongest AB contacts, and compute a score as (AA+BB)/AB. The saddle plot code is part of cooltools ( https://github.com/mirnylab/cooltools ).
deepStats ( Richard, 2019 71. Richard, G. deepStats Version 0.3.1 Zenodo, 2019 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3361799 Google Scholar ) `dsCompareCurves` 0.3.1 was used to compute bootstraps of multiple genomic signals over bins around TAD boundaries in Figures 4 B and 4C. From the bootstraps we calculated a z-score using the following for each bin. 𝑧 − 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑛 = 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 1 − 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 2 2 √ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 . 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑠 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 1 + 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 . 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑠 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 2
The z-score has been converted to p value using `2 ∗ pnorm(-abs(z))`. p values were subsequently corrected across all bins with the Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, we aggregated the corrected p values across all bins using the `sidak` function from the `aggregation` R package ( Šidák, 2012; Yi et al., 2018 79. Šidák, Z. Rectangular Confidence Regions for the Means of Multivariate Normal Distributions J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 2012; 62 :626-633 Google Scholar 92. Yi, L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Bray, N.L. ... Gene-level differential analysis at transcript-level resolution Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :53 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) with p values below 10e-17 that were converted to 10e-17.
