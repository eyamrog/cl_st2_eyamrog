Title: Maturation Kinetics of a Multiprotein Complex Revealed by Metabolic Labeling


Abstract: Summary

All proteins interact with other cellular components to fulfill their function. While tremendous progress has been made in the identification of protein complexes, their assembly and dynamics remain difficult to characterize. Here, we present a high-throughput strategy to analyze the native assembly kinetics of protein complexes. We apply our approach to characterize the co-assembly for 320 pairs of nucleoporins (NUPs) constituting the ≈ 50 MDa nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast. Some NUPs co-assemble fast via rapid exchange whereas others require lengthy maturation steps. This reveals a hierarchical principle of NPC biogenesis where individual subcomplexes form on a minute timescale and then co-assemble from center to periphery in a ∼ 1 h-long maturation process. Intriguingly, the NUP Mlp1 stands out as joining very late and associating preferentially with aged NPCs. Our approach is readily applicable beyond the NPC, making it possible to analyze the intracellular dynamics of a variety of multiprotein assemblies.

Section: Introduction

Cells produce a large number of protein complexes that mediate virtually all biological functions. For example, recent proteome-wide surveys in metazoans have revealed ∼ 1,000 distinct multiprotein complexes, and this number is likely underestimated ( Heusel et al., 2019 29.

Wan, C. ∙ Borgeson, B. ∙ Phanse, S. ... Panorama of ancient metazoan macromolecular complexes Nature. 2015; 525 :339-344 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). With ever more sensitive proteomic and electron microscopy (EM) techniques, the identification and structural characterization of protein complexes is rapidly accelerating, enabling analyses at high-throughput and in close to native conditions ( Rudashevskaya et al., 2016 63.

Cellular and Structural Studies of Eukaryotic Cells by Cryo-Electron Tomography Cells. 2019; 8 :57 Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar ). In sharp contrast, the biogenesis and the dynamics of the vast majority of protein complexes remain very poorly characterized, hampered by a lack of suitable high-throughput approaches. Classical in vitro reconstitution strategies, while highly successful in deciphering the function of protein complexes ( Liu and Fletcher, 2009 39. Liu, A.P. ∙ Fletcher, D.A. Biology under construction: in vitro reconstitution of cellular function Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 :644-650 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ), are typically applicable only to a few proteins at a time. On the other hand, top-down genetic approaches, powerful in identifying the relevant molecular players ( Novick et al., 1980 49. Novick, P. ∙ Field, C. ∙ Schekman, R. Identification of 23 complementation groups required for post-translational events in the yeast secretory pathway Cell. 1980; 21 :205-215 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1395) PubMed Google Scholar ), do not discriminate direct effects from indirect consequences of the introduced changes. Moreover, even when combined, these strategies cannot easily address key questions such as assembly kinetics or the order of the structural maturation processes, making these important issues difficult to tackle.
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is one of the most elaborate protein structures in eukaryotic cells. It consists of ∼ 500 to 1,000 nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins, NUPs) that amount all together to a mass of ∼ 50–100 MDa. Whereas the NPC’s structural organization has been successfully studied in recent years by genetic, biochemical, and high-resolution structural techniques ( Lin and Hoelz, 2019 38.

Progress is hindered by the NPC’s sheer size, its association with lipid membranes, and the central role it plays in gene expression.
To characterize the native assembly process of multiprotein complexes, we introduce here a method, entitled kinetic analysis of incorporation rates in macromolecular assemblies (KARMA). In KARMA, the co-assembly of newly synthesized proteins into a final complex is analyzed akin to a metabolic process by observing metabolic labeling kinetics in affinity-isolated protein complexes. We applied KARMA to study the process of NPC biogenesis and evaluated co-assembly kinetics among 320 pairs of NUPs in actively growing yeast cells. Based on that, we mapped the native order and timing of NPC biogenesis. We find that NUPs initially form subcomplexes, which then assemble in a hierarchical way from the center to the periphery. Unexpectedly, individual NUPs progress through the NPC maturation process at drastically different rates, ranging from minutes to ∼ 1 h, and incorporate into NPCs by different mechanisms: some via dynamic exchange and others by transiting through time-consuming maturation stages. Our results uncover central principles of NPC biogenesis and demonstrate the general utility of metabolic labeling to characterize the dynamics of macromolecular complexes.

Section: Results

Protein complex formation can be thought of as a metabolic process. It begins with the synthesis of new proteins from smaller blocks (amino acids) and proceeds via a chain of maturation intermediates that include folding and multi-subunit assembly steps, ultimately resulting in a mature complex ( Figure 1 A). In our approach to probe the maturation processes of multiprotein complexes (KARMA), one of the protein components of the target complex (the “bait”) is affinity tagged, and newly synthesized proteins are pulse-labeled in actively growing cells by stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) ( Ong et al., 2002 51. Ong, S.E. ∙ Blagoev, B. ∙ Kratchmarova, I. ... Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, SILAC, as a simple and accurate approach to expression proteomics Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1 :376-386 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4754) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tagged protein is isolated by an affinity pull-down (AP) procedure at several post-labeling time points, enabling the detection of bound complex components (the “preys”) ( Figure 1 A). For each time point, the isolated complexes are assayed by data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry ( Gillet et al., 2012 24. Gillet, L.C. ∙ Navarro, P. ∙ Tate, S. ... Targeted data extraction of the MS/MS spectra generated by data-independent acquisition: a new concept for consistent and accurate proteome analysis Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012; 11 O111.016717 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2069) PubMed Google Scholar ) to compute the extent of isotopic protein labeling for each prey ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 A).
The appearance of an isotopic label in prey proteins is inevitably delayed due to preceding structural maturation events ( Figure 1 A). To provide a quantitative framework that relates the labeling kinetics observed in KARMA to assembly events during the maturation process, we developed a simple kinetic state model (KSM) analogous to models used to analyze metabolic fluxes ( Niedenführ et al., 2015 46. Niedenführ, S. ∙ Wiechert, W. ∙ Nöh, K. How to measure metabolic fluxes: a taxonomic guide for (13)C fluxomics Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2015; 34 :82-90 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) and incorporation of proteins into a bacterial ribosome ( Chen et al., 2012 13. Chen, S.S. ∙ Sperling, E. ∙ Silverman, J.M. ... Measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8 :3325-3334 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our KSM describes the propagation of isotopically labeled amino acids throughout the maturation of a protein complex in a growing cell culture as they incorporate into a complex together with a prey protein and are carried along distinct maturation states ( Figure 1 ). In the simplest scenario, the amino acids transition from a maturation state (S1), where the newly made prey protein folds or binds to other components, to the mature state (S2), which is reached when the prey co-assembles with the affinity bait, producing the final KARMA readout as analyzed by AP followed by mass spectrometry ( Figures 1 A, 1D, and 1E; STAR Methods , “Irreversible 2-step assembly”). Other contributing factors such as prey dynamic exchange, degradation, or amino acid turnover can be accounted for by introducing additional KSM states and fluxes ( Figures 2 F and S4 ; STAR Methods ).
In our simple KSM, the distribution between the two states determines the timing of prey labeling, where a higher fraction of protein present in the maturation state translates to slower labeling ( Figures 1 E, S4 A, and S4B) ( STAR Methods , “Irreversible 2-step assembly”). The same also holds true for proteins that can reversibly detach and dynamically exchange between complexes. The labeling kinetics of such proteins can be represented by adding reverse flux to the KSM and mimic stably bound proteins albeit with a smaller fraction in the maturation state ( Figure 2 F). By fitting KARMA readouts with the KSM for non-dynamic proteins, we can quantify the effective fraction of protein in the maturation state, which we refer to as EMP (effective maturation pool), taking values between 0 and 1. For stably bound proteins, the EMP would be an unbiased estimate of the real fraction of protein in the maturation state. For dynamic proteins with an off-rate of 𝐾 o f f , however, the EMP would underestimate the real fraction by a constant factor of ( 1 + 𝐾 o f f / 𝜇 ) − 1 , where μ is the cell culture growth rate ( STAR Methods , “2-step assembly with reversibility”).
When KARMA assays are performed with different structural components of a complex as affinity baits, we expect to observe a larger EMP whenever a bait is located further downstream of a given prey in an ordered maturation process ( Figure 3 A). Thus, by providing an estimate of the protein fraction in the maturation state, the EMP gives a relative measure for the length of the maturation process for a given prey protein with respect to different baits, where more downstream baits will give rise to higher EMPs ( Figure 3 A). Such kinetic readouts provide proximity measures for multiple bait-prey pairs in the maturation process and, therefore, can be used to delineate the order and timing of structural biogenesis events ( Figure 5 A).
In budding yeast, the NPC has a mass of approximately 50 MDa and comprises a total of ∼ 500 proteins ( Kim et al., 2018 34. Kim, S.J. ∙ Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Nudelman, I. ... Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex Nature. 2018; 555 :475-482 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ). It assembles from 34 distinct NUPs, which are present, with few exceptions, in multiples of eight owing to the 8-fold rotational symmetry of the NPC structure ( Rajoo et al., 2018 60. Rajoo, S. ∙ Vallotton, P. ∙ Onischenko, E. ... Stoichiometry and compositional plasticity of the yeast nuclear pore complex revealed by quantitative fluorescence microscopy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E3969-E3977 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2018 34. Kim, S.J. ∙ Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Nudelman, I. ...

The majority of NUPs are arranged into evolutionarily conserved, stable subcomplexes. They form the major NPC sub-structures: two outer rings and the inner ring complex (IRC), which is anchored to the membrane ring and connects to the cytoplasmic export platform, the central channel, and the nuclear basket ( Figure 2 A).
To test the feasibility of KARMA for the analysis of NPC biogenesis, we initially monitored the labeling kinetics of Mlp1, a nuclear basket NUP and well-established affinity bait for the isolation of structurally intact NPCs ( Kim et al., 2018 34. Kim, S.J. ∙ Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Nudelman, I. ... Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex Nature. 2018; 555 :475-482 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mlp1 was endogenously tagged with a tandem Z domain of staphylococcal protein A (ZZ tag) in haploid yeast cells deficient in lysine biosynthesis ( Oeffinger et al., 2007 50. Oeffinger, M. ∙ Wei, K.E. ∙ Rogers, R. ... Comprehensive analysis of diverse ribonucleoprotein complexes Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :951-956 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ; de Godoy, 2014 16. de Godoy, L.M. SILAC yeast: from labeling to comprehensive proteome quantification Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1156 :81-109 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Newly produced proteins were pulse-labeled in a log-phase culture by quickly exchanging the light lysine synthetic medium with a medium containing 13 C 6 15 N 2 (heavy) lysine. Culture samples were collected both immediately before labeling onset and at 30 min intervals thereafter, followed by ZZ-tag APs and mass-spectrometric analysis ( Figures 1 B and S1 A).
We were able to consistently detect and quantify the labeling of 32 NUPs (i.e., all NUPs except for Nup42 and Pom33) across five time points along with more than 600 co-isolated yeast proteins ( Figure S1 B). NUP labeling was highly reproducible across three biological replicates ( Figure S1 C; Table S4 ; see Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability ). NUPs were, on average, labeled more slowly than co-purified bulk proteins and strictly slower than the Mlp1 bait ( Figure 2 C; Table S4 ), consistent with them undergoing a maturation process.
At the same time, we found that NUP labeling rates showed a high degree of variability. NUPs of the symmetrical core, membrane ring, and central channel were generally labeled at slower rates than the ones from the nuclear basket and cytoplasmic export platform. Although labeling rates within sub-structures were typically similar, there were striking exceptions. Within the membrane ring, Ndc1 was labeled with heavy lysine much faster than Pom34 and Pom152. Furthermore, Nup82 and Nup159 of the cytoplasmic export platform were labeled slower than the other components ( Figure 2 B; Table S4 ). Another notable case was Nup145N and Nup145C: these two proteins are produced by autoproteolytic cleavage of a single precursor polypeptide, directly bind to one another ( Teixeira et al., 1997 68. Teixeira, M.T. ∙ Siniossoglou, S. ∙ Podtelejnikov, S. ... Two functionally distinct domains generated by in vivo cleavage of Nup145p: a novel biogenesis pathway for nucleoporins EMBO J. 1997; 16 :5086-5097 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ratner et al., 2007 61. Ratner, G.A. ∙ Hodel, A.E. ∙ Powers, M.A. Molecular determinants of binding between Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly nucleoporins and the nuclear pore complex J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :33968-33976 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) and yet display significantly different labeling kinetics ( Figure 2 D; Table S4 ). Unlike NUPs, nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), which associate with the NPC in a highly dynamic manner, were all rapidly labeled at a rate similar to the Mlp1 bait ( Figure 2 B; Table S4 ).
To test whether the diverse NUP labeling rates could arise from in vitro intermixing during the AP procedure, we analyzed the labeling kinetics of proteins after mixing cell extracts from unlabeled Mlp1-ZZ tagged cultures with wild-type cultures that were labeled with heavy lysine ( Figure S1 D). In contrast to the highly dynamic NTRs, NUPs displayed low intermixing ( < 1 0 % labeling), demonstrating that post-lysis intermixing is not a major contributor to our KARMA readouts ( Figure S1 E; Table S4 ).
Enhanced labeling kinetics could also be due to differences in protein turnover rates ( STAR Methods , “Irreversible 2-step assembly with degradation”). Although earlier proteome-wide analyses had shown that NUPs and NTRs are stable proteins with very slow turnover ( Christiano et al., 2014 14. Christiano, R. ∙ Nagaraj, N. ∙ Fröhlich, F. ... Global proteome turnover analyses of the Yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe Cell Rep. 2014; 9 :1959-1965 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ), it was important to evaluate whether the diversity in labeling rates could be explained by this factor. To this end, we compared the labeling of NUPs, NTRs, and other abundant proteins co-purified in KARMA to the labeling in total cell lysates, which were the source for the respective APs. Parallel reaction monitoring ( Peterson et al., 2012 57. Peterson, A.C. ∙ Russell, J.D. ∙ Bailey, D.J. ... Parallel reaction monitoring for high resolution and high mass accuracy quantitative, targeted proteomics Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11 :1475-1488 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (928) PubMed Google Scholar ) allowed us to follow some of the proteins within each category at the latest post-labeling time point. The investigated proteins did not show prominent labeling differences in total lysates, while their labeling in KARMA was differentially delayed ( Figure 2 E; Table S4 ). We therefore conclude that total intracellular pools of these proteins are replenished at similar rates and that any labeling delay observed in KARMA can be confidently explained by the non-equal time it takes for different NUPs to assemble into a complex with Mlp1.
The observed labeling differences are well explained by our KSM as a tug of war between two kinetic factors: (1) a labeling delay caused by maturation steps preceding the co-assembly with Mlp1 and (2) an accelerating effect caused by a protein’s dynamic exchange that effectively reduces the maturation pool size to various extents for different proteins ( Figures 1 E and 2 F) ( STAR Methods , “2-step assembly with reversibility”). The lack of a maturation state for the bait protein explains the similar labeling kinetics of Mlp1 in total cell lysates and APs ( Figure 2 E; Table S4 ). Furthermore, the exceptionally dynamic association of NTRs with the NPC, also observed in our intermixing assays ( Figure S1 E), effectively shrinks their EMPs to zero and leads to similar labeling kinetics in APs and total cell lysates ( Figure 2 E; Table S4 ). Consistent with this, the highly dynamic behavior previously reported for nuclear basket NUPs ( Niño et al., 2016 48. Niño, C.A. ∙ Guet, D. ∙ Gay, A. ... Posttranslational marks control architectural and functional plasticity of the nuclear pore complex basket J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :167-180 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) can explain their faster labeling compared to NUPs from other sub-structures ( Figure 2 B).
Having established that KARMA can detect differences in NUP maturation kinetics, we expanded our approach to use nine additional NUP baits representing all of the NPC sub-structures except for the membrane ring ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). The Y complex was represented by Nup133, Nup84, and Nup85; the IRC by Nup188; the central channel by Nup57 and Nsp1; the cytoplasmic export platform by Nup82, Nup159, and Nsp1; and the nuclear basket by Nup1 and Mlp1 ( Figure 2 A). A strain expressing a plain ZZ-tag under the control of the Mlp1 promoter (mock bait) was used to discriminate between specific and non-specific interactors in the APs.
In total, we analyzed 120 samples across three post-labeling time points (30, 60, and 90 min), which allowed us to determine the labeling kinetics of all NUPs except Nup42 and Pom33 ( Figure S2 B) along with ∼ 900 other proteins. NUPs were highly enriched in the APs with all baits compared to the mock control ( Figures S2 E and S2F) and displayed highly reproducible labeling across biological replicates ( Figures S2 C; Table S4 ; see also Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability ). As seen for Mlp1, newly synthesized prey NUPs accumulated heavy lysine slower than their cognate baits ( Figure S2 D). NUP labeling significantly varied depending on the bait, in a striking contrast to the NTRs and the majority of other co-purifying proteins ( Figure S2 B). For example, the majority of Y complex preys were labeled significantly faster when probed with the Y complex members Nup85, Nup84, and Nup133 compared to other NUP baits. Similarly, labeling of the cytoplasmic export platform Nup82, Nup159, and Nsp1 was faster when the bait was a member of the same subcomplex ( Figure S2 B). Nsp1 was labeled faster with the Nup57 bait, consistent with it being a part of the central channel complex (Nsp1-Nup57-Nup49) ( Figure S2 B). This indicates that NPC maturation is an overall ordered process and that KARMA can be used to examine this order and its kinetics.
To better characterize the process of NPC biogenesis, we next quantified the duration of the maturation events for each NUP from the moment of biosynthesis to its assembly with each of the 10 baits. As a measure, we determined the EMPs by fitting the KARMA readouts with the KSM for non-dynamic proteins ( Figure S5 A) ( STAR Methods , “KSM for each bait/prey based on labeling”). In our KSM parameterization, we used the median labeling values of three NTRs (Kap95, Kap123, and Mex67) as internal references. These three reference proteins have low protein turnover rates ( Christiano et al., 2014 14. Christiano, R. ∙ Nagaraj, N. ∙ Fröhlich, F. ... Global proteome turnover analyses of the Yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe Cell Rep. 2014; 9 :1959-1965 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ), were reliably detected in all of the KARMA assays, and exhibited consistent and similar labeling kinetics across APs and in total cell lysates ( Figures 2 E and S2 B; Table S4 ; see Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability ). Since the labeling of these proteins was not affected by NPC maturation, they could be used to specifically determine the contribution of the maturation process to the observed labeling kinetics of the preys. In our analysis, we also accounted for the turnover of the intracellular pool of lysine. During translation light lysine molecules that are available in the cell will compete with heavy lysine and thus globally “delay” the labeling of all new proteins including both preys and internal references. To examine and correct for the effect of the intracellular lysine pool on labeling kinetics, we compared the labeling patterns of single- and double-lysine peptides that originate from the same protein, which provide an accurate measure of the heavy lysine fraction available in cells. This enabled us to determine the turnover rate for the intracellular lysine pool and use it in KSM parametrizations when calculating the EMPs ( Figures S4 F–S4J and S5A; STAR Methods , “Estimating intracellular lysine turnover”). In contrast to the lysine content, the peptide position (N- or C-terminal) had no detectable effect on the labeling, indicating that translation does not significantly influence the labeling kinetics (see Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability ). In a few cases, when protein labeling exceeded the reference values (likely due to the fact that mature structures were inaccessible in the APs), we extended the KSM to include an additional inaccessible state ( Figures S4 C–S4E and S5C; STAR Methods , “KSM for each bait/prey based on labeling”).
Altogether, we could fit KARMA readouts and evaluate EMPs for 320 bait-prey pairs of NUPs that displayed a wide range between nearly zero and up to ∼ 80% (median 8%) ( Figure 3 B; Table S3 ; see also Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability ).
Interestingly, we noticed significant bait-dependent variability: EMPs obtained with the NUP baits belonging to the asymmetric NPC sub-structures were distinctively higher than with the symmetric core baits (highest Mlp1, median value 28.9%; lowest Nup133, median value 4.3%) ( Figures 2 A, 3C, and 3 G). Since higher EMPs indicate later co-assembly with prey proteins ( Figure 3 A), this observation suggests that the asymmetric bait NUPs join the NPC maturation process at later steps than the symmetric core baits.
We also observed striking prey-dependent differences among EMPs ( Figure 3 D). For Nsp1, Seh1, Nup188, and Nup133, the EMPs were overall elevated, and their maximum values exceeded 50% ( Figure 3 D; Table S3 ). Since these values represent conservative estimates for the protein fraction in the maturation state ( STAR Methods , “2-step assembly with reversibility”), our analysis suggests that a relatively large fraction of newly made species of these proteins is not stably incorporated into the NPC at steady state.
In our analyses, proteins that rapidly exchange at the NPC are expected to show low EMPs for all baits ( STAR Methods , “2-step assembly with reversibility”). Distinctly low EMPs (maximum values ∼ 10%) were observed for the majority of linker and nuclear basket NUPs, including Nup145N, Nup116, Mlp2, Nup60, Nup2, and Nup1, pointing to their dynamic association with the NPC ( Figures 2 A and 3 D; Table S3 ). Consistent with that, Nup2 and Nup60 were previously shown to rapidly exchange at the NPC ( Niño et al., 2016 48. Niño, C.A. ∙ Guet, D. ∙ Gay, A. ... Posttranslational marks control architectural and functional plasticity of the nuclear pore complex basket J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :167-180 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar , Rabut et al., 2004 59. Rabut, G. ∙ Doye, V. ∙ Ellenberg, J. Mapping the dynamic organization of the nuclear pore complex inside single living cells Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6 :1114-1121 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Surprisingly, a similar pattern was also observed for Ndc1, suggesting a dynamic behavior of this transmembrane Nup essential for NPC biogenesis ( Onischenko et al., 2009 52. Onischenko, E. ∙ Stanton, L.H. ∙ Madrid, A.S. ... Role of the Ndc1 interaction network in yeast nuclear pore complex assembly and maintenance J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185 :475-491 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the validity of this result with an orthogonal method, we monitored the intracellular localization of Ndc1 in live cells. New and old Ndc1 species were differentially labeled after inducing genetic recombination to exchange a green (GFP) to a red (mCherry) fluorescent tag at its C terminus by recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) ( Terweij et al., 2013 70. Terweij, M. ∙ van Welsem, T. ∙ van Deventer, S. ... Recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) cassette series to monitor protein dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae G3 (Bethesda). 2013; 3 :1261-1272 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 H). New and old Ndc1 readily intermixed and co-localized at the nuclear envelope (NE) to almost the same extent as a control, in which both GFP and mCherry were fused in tandem to Nup170 ( Khmelinskii et al., 2012 33. Khmelinskii, A. ∙ Keller, P.J. ∙ Bartosik, A. ... Tandem fluorescent protein timers for in vivo analysis of protein dynamics Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :708-714 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). This was in contrast to a non-dynamic Nup133, where the green and red pools remained separate after tag exchange ( Figures 3 I and 3J). Thus, Ndc1 is indeed a dynamic NUP. Interestingly, NUPs with low EMPs are almost always located at the NPC periphery suggesting that these parts are attached more loosely than the symmetric core of the NPC ( Figure 3 F).
Our KSM framework also defines a temporal distance in the maturation process, which we refer to as the effective maturation time ( 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑇 = 𝑡 𝐷 × 𝜑 ′ / ( 1 − 𝜑 ′ ) , where 𝑡 𝐷 is cell culture doubling time and 𝜑 ′ is the EMP; STAR Methods , “Analytical solution for maturation time”). For non-dynamic proteins, it represents a characteristic residence time after which 50% of the proteins in the maturation state would associate with the bait. For dynamic proteins, the EMT is still an accurate estimate and thus provides an intuitive measure for the timescale of complex assembly events ( Figures 3 E and S3 F; Table S3 ). Taking 90 min as a standard yeast duplication time in our experiments, this revealed that the co-assembly of dynamic NUPs with the majority of baits occurs on a minute timescale (up to ∼ 10 min), whereas for Nup133, Nup188, Nsp1, and Seh1, the maturation process can be in the order of 1 h ( Figures 3 E and S3 F).
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that NPC biogenesis is a non-random and lengthy process that requires on average approximately one yeast cell cycle to be fully completed. NUPs take very different routes to join the NPC, and we can differentiate rapidly exchanging fast-maturing NUPs (like Ndc1, Nup60, and Nup2) from slow-maturing ones (such as Nup133, Nup188, Seh1, and Nsp1), which are likely present in large maturation pools not stably associated with the NPC structure.
We next set out to determine the order of the NPC maturation events. NUPs that quickly interact after biosynthesis and stay together in a stable subcomplex should share the same downstream assembly intermediates and, as a result, are expected to produce highly correlated labeling patterns when probed with different baits ( Figure 4 A).
We computed pairwise correlation distances among NUP labeling profiles at the first post-labeling time point (labeling values obtained across all ten baits) and subjected them to hierarchical clustering ( Figure 4 B). Using this analysis, NUPs could be divided into nine similarity groups, which were also largely conserved across all time points ( Figures 4 B–4D and S3 A). The smallest groups contained only a single protein, such as Mlp1, Mlp2, and Nup188, whereas the largest group—the Nup53 group—comprised nine NUPs ( Figures 4 D). Ndc1 and Gle1 were not categorized since they did not show labeling similarity to any other NUPs likely due to highly dynamic behavior and high variability of labeling values among biological replicates, respectively ( Figures 3 D, 3J, S2 B, and S3 D). Another outlier was Nsp1, which is a component of both the central channel and the cytoplasmic export platform complex. Although it showed some labeling similarity to both the Nup159 and Nup57 groups at later time points ( Figures S3 A and S3C), it could not be exclusively assigned to any of the two.
Consistent with a co-assembly behavior, the bait-prey pairs from the same group were much closer to one another in the maturation order and had drastically shorter EMTs compared to bait-prey pairs from other groups (median within-group EMT <1 min, median between-groups EMT ≈ 9 min) ( Figures 3 A, 4 E, and 4F). Interestingly, for Seh1, a member of the Y complex, the shortest EMT exceeded 20 min. Thus, Seh1 likely undergoes a lengthy maturation process that delays its interactions with other NUPs ( Figures 3 E and S3 F). Similarly, Mlp1 and Nup188 display large EMT values across all baits ( Figures 3 E and S3 F).
The multiprotein assembly groups that we identified highly resemble the NPC structural modules, and their members are typically juxtaposed within the NPC architecture ( Figures 2 A and 4 D). However, there are a few notable exceptions: (1) The Y complex and the interacting Nup145N could be divided into the Nup85-group and Nup84-group mapping to the head and stem of the Y complex respectively ( Kampmann and Blobel, 2009 31. Kampmann, M. ∙ Blobel, G. Three-dimensional structure and flexibility of a membrane-coating module of the nuclear pore complex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 :782-788 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 B–4D and S3 B); (2) the Nup53 group, composed of inner ring and membrane ring NUPs, also contained Nup116 and Gle2, which are part of the cytoplasmic export platform ( Figures 4 B–4D and S3 A); (3) Ndc1, that interacts with the membrane ring and linker NUPs ( Onischenko et al., 2009 52. Onischenko, E. ∙ Stanton, L.H. ∙ Madrid, A.S. ... Role of the Ndc1 interaction network in yeast nuclear pore complex assembly and maintenance J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185 :475-491 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Alber et al., 2007 1. Alber, F. ∙ Dokudovskaya, S. ∙ Veenhoff, L.M. ... The molecular architecture of the nuclear pore complex Nature. 2007; 450 :695-701 Crossref Scopus (861) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not show prominent similarity to either ( Figure S3 D); and (4) lastly, the paralogs Mlp1 and Mlp2 had distinct labeling profiles that did not match those of Nup1 and Nup60 despite their reported biochemical interactions ( Figure S3 E) ( Niepel et al., 2013 47. Niepel, M. ∙ Molloy, K.R. ∙ Williams, R. ... The nuclear basket proteins Mlp1p and Mlp2p are part of a dynamic interactome including Esc1p and the proteasome Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24 :3920-3938 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2018 34. Kim, S.J. ∙ Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Nudelman, I. ... Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex Nature. 2018; 555 :475-482 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Notwithstanding these few exceptions, our findings suggest that the NPC maturation process follows the modular organization principle of the NPC structure, starting with the fast (minute timescale) assembly of individual subcomplexes, which is then followed by a slower (10-minute timescale) higher-order, co-assembly process.
The diverse maturation kinetics that we observed for bait-prey pairs from different assembly groups ( Figures 4 E and 4F) suggest that the higher-order NPC assembly follows an ordered pathway. To delineate this pathway, we developed an unbiased, computational pipeline in which NPC biogenesis was represented as a binary tree and assembly groups were allowed to merge until they form the complete NPC structure ( Figures 5 A and S5 E; STAR Methods , “Maturation sequence of NPC biogenesis”). All possible binary trees were scored to find the best predictors producing the closest possible match to the observed EMP values ( Figure 5 A).
Within each assembly group, we defined a single, representative bait and a set of non-bait proteins ( Figure S5 D). We excluded potentially dynamic proteins within each group (NUPs that displayed small EMPs with all baits) and, where applicable, NUPs that assemble within the group with a significant delay (e.g., Seh1). There were 2,027,025 possible binary trees with nine distinct leaves ( Figure S5 F; STAR Methods , “Tree generating procedure”). This number was small enough to perform an exhaustive search of all trees and to score them based on the root mean square error (RMSE) to the experimentally obtained EMPs for the respective bait-prey pairs ( Figure 5 A; STAR Methods , “KSM for each bait/prey based on labeling”).
Our analysis did not reveal a prominent single best fit, but among the best trees, we found many with almost identical scores ( Figure S5 F; see Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability ). In order to avoid over-fitting, we pooled the 0.1% highest ranking trees and identified the maturation order from the distributions of the levels for each group, representing the number of merges required to assemble into a complete structure ( Figures 5 A–5C). Based on that, the assembly groups could be split into three distinct tiers with highly similar positions in the maturation order. An early tier (highest levels) contained the Nup53, Nup188, Nup57, and Nup84 groups comprising the symmetrical NPC elements as well as Nup116 and Gle2; the intermediate tier contained the asymmetrical NUPs (the Nup159 group and Nup1 group) and, interestingly, also the head part of the Y complex (Nup85 group). The late tier was represented by Mlp1 and Mlp2, which were observed to associate last ( Figures 5 B–5D). Of note, similar results were also obtained with the EMP values corrected for protein intermixing at the AP step ( Figures S5 H and S5I; Table S4 ; see Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability ; STAR Methods , “Contribution of AP intermixing”), indicating that our NPC maturation model is sufficiently robust against this bias. Taken together, NPC maturation begins with the symmetric NUPs, continues with the asymmetric ones, and concludes with the Mlp proteins.
To approximate the timescale of these milestone events, we also determined median maturation times for pairs of NUPs across tiers. Whereas both early and intermediate tier NUPs co-assemble into one complex relatively quickly (with maturation times of ∼ 10 min and ∼ 5 min, respectively), their final assembly with the late tier occurs on a remarkably long timescale with a maturation time of ∼ 1 h ( Figures 5 D and S5 G).
Our results suggested that Mlp1 and Mlp2 preferentially bind to morphologically complete NPC structures ∼ 1 h after their formation. To confirm this unexpected finding, we again used RITE and visualized new and old NPCs in live cells either by removing or introducing a GFP-tag at the C terminus of the early tier NUP Nup133 ( Figure 6 A). Remarkably, mCherry-tagged Mlp1 co-localized very well with old NPCs but not with new NPC structures ( Figures 6 B–6E). We observed this both using NE cross-correlation between GFP and mCherry signals ( Figures 6 B and 6C) and by examining individual NPCs at mitotic anaphase bridges ( Rajoo et al., 2018 60. Rajoo, S. ∙ Vallotton, P. ∙ Onischenko, E. ... Stoichiometry and compositional plasticity of the yeast nuclear pore complex revealed by quantitative fluorescence microscopy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E3969-E3977 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Winey et al., 1997 81. Winey, M. ∙ Yarar, D. ∙ Giddings, Jr., T.H.J. ... Nuclear pore complex number and distribution throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle by three-dimensional reconstruction from electron micrographs of nuclear envelopes Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8 :2119-2132 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 6 D and 6E). These findings confirm that Mlp1 indeed preferentially binds to aged NPC structures, which might explain earlier observations that Mlp1/2 are present only at a subset of the NPCs ( Galy et al., 2004 22. Galy, V. ∙ Gadal, O. ∙ Fromont-Racine, M. ... Nuclear retention of unspliced mRNAs in yeast is mediated by perinuclear Mlp1 Cell. 2004; 116 :63-73 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Unexpectedly, our analysis also placed the Nup116-Gle2 complex within the early tier together with IRC NUPs, apart from the other cytoplasmic export platform members ( Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2016 21. Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Kim, S.J. ∙ Shi, Y. ... Structure and Function of the Nuclear Pore Complex Cytoplasmic mRNA Export Platform Cell. 2016; 167 :1215-1228.e25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 B–4D, 5 D, and S3 A). To further explore this finding, we analyzed the distribution of Nup116 in apq12 Δ cells that exhibit an NPC biogenesis defect failing to form a fusion pore across the nuclear membrane ( Scarcelli et al., 2007 64. Scarcelli, J.J. ∙ Hodge, C.A. ∙ Cole, C.N. The yeast integral membrane protein Apq12 potentially links membrane dynamics to assembly of nuclear pore complexes J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178 :799-812 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the non-permissive temperature, apq12 Δ cells displayed a prominent nuclear envelope localization of Nup116, similar to the IRC component Nup170. By contrast, another cytoplasmic export platform NUP, Nup82, was completely mislocalized ( Figures 6 F and 6G). This supports our conclusion that during NPC maturation Nup116 assembles with IRC NUPs prior to Nup82.
In summary, our results reveal the timing and order of the native NPC maturation events in detail and demonstrate that NPC biogenesis in budding yeast is a surprisingly lengthy process that follows a hierarchical principle.

Section: Discussion

Protein complexes are at the heart of most cellular processes ( Hartwell et al., 1999 27. Hartwell, L.H. ∙ Hopfield, J.J. ∙ Leibler, S. ... From molecular to modular cell biology Nature. 1999; 402 :C47-C52 Crossref Scopus (2901) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, they are mostly treated as constant entities with a defined structure and composition, and our knowledge about their dynamics in the context of living cells is often very limited. In this study, we introduce KARMA, which characterizes the order and assembly kinetics of protein complexes similar to methods used for analyzing metabolic processes ( Cheah and Young, 2018 12. Cheah, Y.E. ∙ Young, J.D. Isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA): putting theory into practice Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2018; 54 :80-87 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Current methods used to analyze the native assembly of macromolecular complexes are generally structure-centered: individual assembly intermediates are either identified in situ , in cell extracts, or biochemically isolated and characterized to compare their subunit composition and infer the assembly order ( Harnpicharnchai et al., 2001 26. Harnpicharnchai, P. ∙ Jakovljevic, J. ∙ Horsey, E. ... Composition and functional characterization of yeast 66S ribosome assembly intermediates Mol. Cell. 2001; 8 :505-515 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (260) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2012 13. Chen, S.S. ∙ Sperling, E. ∙ Silverman, J.M. ... Measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8 :3325-3334 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bogenhagen et al., 2018 8. Bogenhagen, D.F. ∙ Ostermeyer-Fay, A.G. ∙ Haley, J.D. ... Kinetics and Mechanism of Mammalian Mitochondrial Ribosome Assembly Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :1935-1944 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, KARMA presents a bottom-up approach to this problem. Similarities and differences in co-assembly kinetics of baits and preys are used to delineate the order and timing of the complex maturation process. Importantly, every bait in KARMA represents an independent experiment. This renders KARMA readily applicable to structures with a wide range of complexities and abundances. Moreover, a priori knowledge of complex composition is not a prerequisite; the information on protein interactions can be obtained directly from the experiments by analyzing specific enrichments. In addition, the generated mass-spectrometry data can detect other maturation events, e.g., changes in post-translational modifications or polypeptide integrity.
The quantitative framework of KARMA is a KSM ( Figures 1 , S4 , and S5 ). Our KSM is an implementation of an isotopically instationary steady-state metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA)—a variant of metabolic flux analysis developed to quantify the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the cell using isotopic labeling of small molecules. The ordinary differential equation system at the root of INST-MFA is the basis for our KSM, which extends it beyond pure metabolic networks into the realm of protein synthesis and maturation. Previously, such an approach was already used to characterize the maturation process of E. coli ribosomes ( Chen et al., 2012 13. Chen, S.S. ∙ Sperling, E. ∙ Silverman, J.M. ... Measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8 :3325-3334 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The protein labeling data used in KARMA to characterize maturation processes are influenced by other factors besides the maturation per se. This includes variability, e.g., in time of sample collection, growth rate difference among strains, potential differences in the protein biosynthesis (translation) rates, or protein turnover. To account for the contribution of these factors, we relied on internal references in our analysis. One important internal reference is provided by proteins whose labeling kinetics are not affected by the maturation of the complex of interest. In the present work we used NTRs—a protein group known to highly dynamically interact with the NPC ( Aramburu and Lemke, 2017 3. Aramburu, I.V. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Floppy but not sloppy: Interaction mechanism of FG-nucleoporins and nuclear transport receptors Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 68 :34-41 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). The only general requirements for such internal references are a low turnover rate, as well as similar labeling rates across different baits and in total cell lysates versus APs. These references can be easily chosen among the multitude of co-purified proteins. Additionally, we accounted for an inaccessible pool of proteins by introducing an inaccessible state into our KSM as well as for the available lysine pool in yeast cells monitoring differences in labeling between single- and double-lysine peptides ( Figures S4 F–S4J). In fact, our estimated turnover of the intracellular lysine pool is only about three times faster than the duration of the yeast cell cycle, and therefore lysine turnover significantly and globally delays protein labeling. Large cellular amounts of lysine could be contributed by protein turnover including co-translational protein degradation ( Turner and Varshavsky, 2000 72. Turner, G.C. ∙ Varshavsky, A. Detecting and measuring cotranslational protein degradation in vivo Science. 2000; 289 :2117-2120 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). We note that this factor is often not accounted for in pulse-labeling experiments but can lead to a significant bias in estimated rates and pool sizes.
Our KSM-based analysis readily identifies dynamic proteins within target structures. Using the KSM framework, we demonstrate that the EMP is sensitive to exchange ( STAR Methods , “2-step assembly with reversibility”). As a result, a low EMP, regardless of the bait, is a signature of proteins that rapidly exchange between bound and unbound states. In addition to Nup2 and Nup60, which were previously shown to be dynamic NPC components, KARMA revealed an unexpected dynamic behavior of the transmembrane NUP Ndc1 ( Figures 3 D, 3I, and 3J). The exchange of Ndc1 at the NPC appears to occur on a longer timescale than the lateral movement of yeast NPCs in the nuclear envelope and therefore could not be readily captured by conventional photobleaching techniques ( Chadrin et al., 2010 10. Chadrin, A. ∙ Hess, B. ∙ San Roman, M. ... Pom33, a novel transmembrane nucleoporin required for proper nuclear pore complex distribution J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189 :795-811 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, Ndc1 is a shared component of the NPC and spindle pole body and is critical for the biogenesis of both structures ( Madrid et al., 2006 42. Madrid, A.S. ∙ Mancuso, J. ∙ Cande, W.Z. ... The role of the integral membrane nucleoporins Ndc1p and Pom152p in nuclear pore complex assembly and function J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173 :361-371 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Onischenko et al., 2009 52. Onischenko, E. ∙ Stanton, L.H. ∙ Madrid, A.S. ... Role of the Ndc1 interaction network in yeast nuclear pore complex assembly and maintenance J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185 :475-491 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Winey et al., 1993 80. Winey, M. ∙ Hoyt, M.A. ∙ Chan, C. ... NDC1: a nuclear periphery component required for yeast spindle pole body duplication J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122 :743-751 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). The dynamics of Ndc1 might help to accommodate changes in membrane topology during insertion of these structures into the nuclear envelope.
In addition, we also observe proteins that have exceptionally large EMPs. This includes Nup188, Seh1, Nsp1, and Nup133, indicating that a large pool of these proteins is not incorporated into the mature NPC ( Figure 3 D). Accordingly, newly produced Nsp1 was reported to localize at distinct cytoplasmic speckles in daughter yeast cells ( Colombi et al., 2013 15. Colombi, P. ∙ Webster, B.M. ∙ Fröhlich, F. ... The transmission of nuclear pore complexes to daughter cells requires a cytoplasmic pool of Nsp1 J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203 :215-232 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, at least two proteins with large EMPs, Seh1 and Nsp1, are known to form alternative complexes ( Kim et al., 2018 34. Kim, S.J. ∙ Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Nudelman, I. ... Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex Nature. 2018; 555 :475-482 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dokudovskaya et al., 2011 17. Dokudovskaya, S. ∙ Waharte, F. ∙ Schlessinger, A. ... A conserved coatomer-related complex containing Sec13 and Seh1 dynamically associates with the vacuole in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mol Cell Proteomics. 2011; 10 M110.006478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). A similar behavior was also reported for several E. coli ribosomal proteins with alternative cellular functions ( Chen et al., 2012 13. Chen, S.S. ∙ Sperling, E. ∙ Silverman, J.M. ... Measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8 :3325-3334 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Large maturation pools could therefore represent a cell’s strategy to avoid competition between alternative complexes for protein availability.
On the other extreme, we also identify NUPs that rapidly co-assemble, typically on a minute timescale before entering downstream maturation events ( Figures 4 and S3 ). These assembly groups are often juxtaposed in the NPC and correspond to stable subcomplexes ( Figures 2 A and 4 D). While this might not be a surprising result, it points to a structure-guided modularity of NPC assembly. Yet, there are notable exceptions. Our observations support early recruitment of Nup116 and Gle2 apart from the other members of the cytoplasmic export platform ( Figures 5 D, 6F, and 6 G). This may explain both the severe NPC structural defects observed in Nup116 and Gle2 mutants, not seen for other cytoplasmic export platform NUPs, as well as the importance of Nup116 interactions with scaffold NUPs in NPC biogenesis ( Murphy et al., 1996 45. Murphy, R. ∙ Watkins, J.L. ∙ Wente, S.R.

After its synthesis, the path that a protein undergoes before reaching the complete structure is a result of a vast number of individual assembly events. To probe the global order of the NPC maturation process, we adopted a brute-force strategy exploring all possible binary merge trees among the NUP assembly groups. This is still likely an oversimplification of the real process, but assessing all possible arrangements provides an unbiased way to test the existence of an overall assembly order ( Figures 5 A–5C; STAR Methods , “Maturation sequence of NPC biogenesis”). With this strategy, we found that the initial assembly events were dominated by the symmetrical core NUPs, followed by the asymmetrical ones, and then by the most distal nuclear basket NUPs, Mlp1 and Mlp2 ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Such a centrifugal NPC maturation order is consistent with observations by live imaging techniques and cryo-EM tomography in mammalian cells ( Otsuka et al., 2016 54. Otsuka, S. ∙ Bui, K.H. ∙ Schorb, M. ... Nuclear pore assembly proceeds by an inside-out extrusion of the nuclear envelope eLife. 2016; 5 :e19071 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; 2018 55. Otsuka, S. ∙ Steyer, A.M. ∙ Schorb, M. ... Postmitotic nuclear pore assembly proceeds by radial dilation of small membrane openings Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :21-28 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). One noteworthy outcome of our analysis is the asynchronous assembly of the stem and the head NUPs of the Y complex. Although the relevance of this result requires further investigation, in fission yeast, Y complex NUPs differentially localize on the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides of the NPC ( Asakawa et al., 2019 4. Asakawa, H. ∙ Kojidani, T. ∙ Yang, H.J. ... Asymmetrical localization of Nup107-160 subcomplex components within the nuclear pore complex in fission yeast PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1008061 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). A similar split arrangement might transiently exist in budding yeast during NPC maturation.
Being a quantitative kinetic approach at its core, KARMA provides temporal information, and we could estimate the duration of the three major NPC biogenesis steps that we identified. Completion of the two early steps (co-assembly of the early and the intermediate NUP tiers, resulting in a complete set of NUPs but excluding Mlp1 and Mlp2) occurred in the range of 10–20 min. On the other hand, the acquisition of Mlp1 and Mlp2 is a much longer process taking ∼ 1 h ( Figure 5 D). This reveals that the complete yeast NPC maturation process is slow, particularly in relation to the yeast cell cycle timing ( ∼ 90 min), but similar timescales were previously estimated for mammalian NPCs ( Otsuka et al., 2016 54. Otsuka, S. ∙ Bui, K.H. ∙ Schorb, M. ... Nuclear pore assembly proceeds by an inside-out extrusion of the nuclear envelope eLife. 2016; 5 :e19071 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dultz and Ellenberg, 2010 18. Dultz, E. ∙ Ellenberg, J. Live imaging of single nuclear pores reveals unique assembly kinetics and mechanism in interphase J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191 :15-22 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Even though very slow acquisition of the Mlps came as a surprise, orthogonal experiments confirmed that Mlp1 predominantly joins fully assembled NPCs ( Figures 6 B–6E). The mechanism of slow Mlp-recruitment is yet to be understood and might be explained, e.g., by a cell cycle-dependent licensing event. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that old and young NPCs have different compositions, raising an intriguing question of their functional specialization. Interestingly, Mlp-associated NPCs are excluded from the yeast nucleolar region and localize to only a subset of NPCs ( Galy et al., 2004 22. Galy, V. ∙ Gadal, O. ∙ Fromont-Racine, M. ... Nuclear retention of unspliced mRNAs in yeast is mediated by perinuclear Mlp1 Cell. 2004; 116 :63-73 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our results might provide a non-intuitive, kinetic explanation for these phenomena.
The basis of modern molecular biology lies in classic experiments, e.g., the demonstration of the chemical nature of genes ( Hershey and Chase, 1952 28. Hershey, A.D. ∙ Chase, M. Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 36 :39-56 Crossref Scopus (639) PubMed Google Scholar ) or the semiconservative mechanism of DNA replication ( Meselson and Stahl, 1958 43. Meselson, M. ∙ Stahl, F.W. The Replication of DNA in Escherichia Coli Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1958; 44 :671-682 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These foundational studies were carried out by metabolic labeling, harnessing the interconversion of small cellular metabolites to trace the fate of vital macromolecules. Conceptually, KARMA builds on these classic approaches. The metabolite in our analysis is heavy lysine, while the macromolecular actors are distinct proteins that have a defined origin (protein synthesis) and a defined destination (complex with another protein of interest). By employing a modern quantitative framework, we quantify distances between these two points to evaluate the dynamics of protein-protein interactions. Although here we apply KARMA to a single structure, the NPC, this platform can easily be adapted to uncover other currently enigmatic dynamic aspects of the cellular proteome including, e.g., the turnover of protein complexes, or to address host-pathogen interactions. In combination with other pulse-labeling techniques, our analysis pipeline could also be readily expanded beyond the realm of proteins to analyze live dynamics of RNA or other biological molecules.

Yeast strains and plasmids generated in this study (see Table S1 ) were produced by standard molecular cloning procedures. All yeast strains generated in this study were derived from BY4742 strain ( MAT(alpha) his3∆1 leu2∆0 lys2∆0 ura3∆0 ). Scarless tagging within the FG-repeat portion of Nup57 and Nsp1 with the ZZ-tag was carried out by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing Laughery et al. (2015) 37. Laughery, M.F. ∙ Hunter, T. ∙ Brown, A. ... New vectors for simple and streamlined CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast. 2015; 32 :711-720 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar . The guide RNA sequences (see Key Resources Table) were designed using the web tool ( www.benchling.com ), choosing the predicted sequences with the highest on-target and lowest off-target scores. All other molecular tags were introduced C-terminally at the endogenous gene locus using the Pringle method ( Longtine et al., 1998 40. Longtine, M.S. ∙ McKenzie, 3rd, A. ∙ Demarini, D.J. ... Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast. 1998; 14 :953-961 Crossref Scopus (4388) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unless otherwise indicated, all yeast strains were grown at 3 0 ∘ C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or in synthetic complete medium (SCD, 6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose) with the necessary amino acid dropouts and/or additives. The SCD medium variant used for antibiotic selection, designated SCG, contained 1.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and was additionally supplemented with 1 g/L l -glutamic acid monosodium salt as a nitrogen source.
IgG-coupled Dynabeads were prepared essentially as described in Alber et al. (2007) 1. Alber, F. ∙ Dokudovskaya, S. ∙ Veenhoff, L.M. ... The molecular architecture of the nuclear pore complex Nature. 2007; 450 :695-701 Crossref Scopus (861) PubMed Google Scholar . 300 mg of magnetic M-270 Epoxy coated Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) were re-suspended in 16 mL of 0.1 M Sodium Phosphate Buffer (0.1 M Na 2 H/NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.4) and vortexed for 30 s. Fresh Antibody Mix was prepared by solubilizing 100 mg of rabbit IgG powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in 3.5 mL distilled water. Insoluble material was removed by 10 min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge precooled to 4 ∘ C. 3525 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 9.85 mL of 0.1M Sodium Phosphate Buffer, immediately followed by the addition of 6.65 mL Ammonium Sulfate Buffer (3M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 in 0.1 M Sodium Phosphate Buffer). The Antibody Mix was then filtered through a 0.22 mm Millex-GP filter (Merck Millipore). The bead suspension was washed once with 0.1 M Sodium Phosphate Buffer, supplemented with the Antibody Mix and incubated under constant agitation for ∼ 18 h at 3 0 ∘ C. Thereafter, IgG-coupled beads were briefly washed once with 100 mM Glycine-HCl pH 2.5, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8 and 100 mM freshly prepared triethylamine. This was followed by 4 × 5 min washes with 3 mL PBS pH 7.4 and 2 × 10 min washes with 3 mL PBS pH 7.4 containing 0.5% v/v Triton X-100. Finally, the bead-solution was equilibrated with PBS pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.02% NaN 3 and stored at 4 ∘ C.
Prior to imaging, all yeast strains endogenously expressing NUPs C-terminally fused with variants of RITE tags ( Webster et al., 2014 79. Webster, B.M. ∙ Colombi, P. ∙ Jäger, J. ...

USA. 2010; 107 :64-68 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) were grown to mid log-phase in SCG medium supplemented with 300 μg/mL hygromycin B (Roche) to maintain selection for non-recombined cells. Cells were collected by centrifugation and recovered for one h in fresh SCG medium without hygromycin. Recombination was induced by addition of 1 μM beta-estradiol (f.c., Sigma-Aldrich). The NUP-RITE fusions switching from mCherry to GFP were imaged 3 h after addition of beta-estradiol, RITE variants switching from no signal to GFP – after 2 h, and from GFP to no signal – after 5 h.
Yeast strains endogenously expressing Nup-fluorophore fusions in the apq12 Δ background were initially grown to mid log phase at 3 0 ∘ C in SCD. The cultures were then shifted to the target temperature ( 1 6 ∘ C or 3 0 ∘ C) and imaged 24 h post shift.
For quantitative analysis, yeast cells were imaged in Concanavalin A-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) glass bottom MatriPlates (Brooks) on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti) equipped with a PlanApo 100 × NA 1.4 oil-immersion objective and a Spectra X LED light source (Lumencore). The images were acquired using a Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) and the NIS Elements software (Nikon).
We used automated image analysis to measure the abundances and patterns formed by various NUPs at the NE. The precise specification of the method is given by the corresponding MATLAB code (see NEdetectorEO.m and Correlationextraction.m). In order to account for dark current, stray light, and other contributions that are not directly related to the presence of our labeled NUPs, image intensities are measured in background-corrected images using the top-hat transform ( Soille, 2013 67. Soille, P. Morphological Image Analysis: Principles and Applications. Springer Science & Business Media, 2013 Google Scholar ). Candidate nuclear centers were first identified by local intensity maxima detection performed on images obtained by the difference of Gaussian method. We then identified the best circular shortest path around these candidate nuclei using dynamic programming as described e.g., in Vallotton et al. (2010) 73. Vallotton, P. ∙ Sun, C. ∙ Lovell, D. ... DroplIT, an improved image analysis method for droplet identification in high-throughput crystallization trials J. Appl. Cryst. 2010; 43 :1548-1552 Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar . Dynamic programming is used to circumvent the explosion in the number of possible paths that would result if a more naive method was exploited to enumerate all possible paths. Our method identifies the best trace encircling the candidate point, where best refers to the mean intensity along the trace and to the path smoothness. After a first pass, all candidate nuclei positions are moved to the center of mass of all pixels belonging to the traces and a second tracing round is initiated. This bootstrapping procedure provides an opportunity to locate the nuclei positions more precisely and markedly improves the quality of the final traces. Only traces featuring significant Nup abundance were retained. To that end, a threshold on the total measured Nup signal along the contour was set such that spurious traces are returned by the algorithm at a frequency below 0.1%. To ensure similar abundance of newly made versus old proteins in the experiments involving RITE constructs switching from mCherry to GFP, the analyzed contours were filtered based on the background-corrected red/green intensities and only cells with red/green intensity ratios between 0.45 and 0.75 were considered for quantification. For each retained contour, we calculated the Pearson cross-correlation between background-corrected red and green fluorescence intensity. For the RITE constructs switching from no signal to GFP and GFP to no signal, non-recombining and already fully recombined cells were excluded by only considering cells with average background-corrected GFP intensities between 85 and 150. For the analysis of individual NPCs, anaphase bridges were identified in the GFP channel and then the respective signal in the corresponding mCherry channel was assessed, discriminating between overlapping and non-overlapping signal ( Rajoo et al., 2018 60. Rajoo, S. ∙ Vallotton, P. ∙ Onischenko, E. ... Stoichiometry and compositional plasticity of the yeast nuclear pore complex revealed by quantitative fluorescence microscopy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E3969-E3977 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar , Winey et al., 1997 81. Winey, M. ∙ Yarar, D. ∙ Giddings, Jr., T.H.J. ... Nuclear pore complex number and distribution throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle by three-dimensional reconstruction from electron micrographs of nuclear envelopes Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8 :2119-2132 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). The distribution of NUPs in the apq12 Δ strains was analyzed, by qualitatively assessing distribution in the NE. Prior to analysis the images were randomized and for each NUP at least 500 cells were evaluated. Brightness and contrast of the presented micrographs was adjusted the same for all images belonging to one panel using Fiji. Statistical analysis and graphical representation of the data was carried out in R.
Yeast strains were pre-cultured overnight in YPD at 3 0 ∘ C to reach stationary phase. The cultures were diluted 1:125 in fresh YPD and growth curves were acquired in a CLARIOstar Plus automated plate reader (BMG Labtech) at 3 0 ∘ C in 24-well plastic dishes (Thermo Fisher) by taking OD 600 measurements every 5 min for 25 h.
All metabolic labeling assays were performed at 3 0 ∘ C using pre-warmed culture media. Prior to the labeling onset, yeast cultures were propagated for a minimum of 16 h in synthetic complete dextrose (SCD) medium containing light l -lysine (25 mg/L). Pulse-labeling was performed at OD 600 0.8-1.0 using vacuum filtration on a 0.8 μm nitrocellulose membrane to exchange light medium with heavy medium containing 13 C 6 15 N 2 l -lysine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 25 mg/L). Prior to re-inoculation into heavy medium, cells were briefly washed on the filtration membrane with 50 mL of heavy l -lysine medium. Samples corresponding to the time point zero were collected immediately before the labeling onset by filtration of an equivalent of 250 mL cell culture of OD 600 1.0 on a nitrocellulose membrane, briefly washed on the membrane with distilled water, and snap frozen in liquid N 2 . The post-labeling samples were collected in a similar manner at 30 min intervals. For the duration of the time course all cultures were maintained in log-phase in an OD range of 0.8 – 1.5 by periodical dilution with pre-warmed heavy l -lysine medium. To asses the extent of metabolic labeling due to protein intermixing during the affinity pulldown procedure log-phase yeast cultures endogenously expressing Mlp1-ZZ fusion and grown in SCD containing light l -lysine (25 mg/L) were mixed with equal amounts of the wild-type log-phase cultures propagated in 13 C 6 15 N 2 l -lysine medium for a minimum of 16 h. Cells (corresponding to 200 mL of each cell culture of OD 600 1.0) were harvested as described above.
NUP complexes were isolated according to a modified version of the NPC affinity isolation protocol described in Kim et al. (2018) 34. Kim, S.J. ∙ Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Nudelman, I. ... Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex Nature. 2018; 555 :475-482 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar . All of the following procedures were performed in ice-cold conditions unless otherwise stated. Frozen yeast pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL Lysis Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KOAc, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 10% v/v glycerol) and transferred into 2 mL screw-cap micro tubes (Sarstedt Inc) pre-filled with approximately 1 mL of 0.5 mm glass beads (Biospec products). To avoid air inclusions the tubes were spun down and filled up completely with the Lysis Buffer. Cells were lysed by four one-minute cycles at 3500 oscillations per minute in a mini-BeadBeater-24 (BioSpec Products), with 1 min cooling intermissions in ice-water mix between the cycles. Cell lysates were clarified by 30 s centrifugation at 10,000 RPM and 150 μl of supernatant was frozen in liquid N 2 for later analysis of the source full cell lysates. 1 mL of the remaining supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and supplemented with IgG coupled Dynabeads, pre-equilibrated with Binding Buffer (0.5% v/v Triton X-100 and 0.1% v/v Tween-20 in Lysis Buffer) and the amount of 10 × detergent mastermix (protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 5% v/v Triton x-100, 1% v/v Tween-20 in Lysis Buffer) necessary to match the detergent concentration in the binding buffer. Following 30 min incubation at 4 ∘ C, the beads were washed twice with 1 mL of Wash Buffer (0.1% v/v Tween-20 in Lysis Buffer). Bound proteins were eluted for 2 min at 5 0 ∘ C with 35 μl of 1 × Laemmli sample buffer. Later, the eluates were completely denatured for 5 min at 9 5 ∘ C.
Eluted proteins were electrophoretically concentrated by SDS-PAGE in a 4% acrylamide stacking gel. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie R-250 (Bio-Rad) staining and the excised areas were processed with a standard in-gel tryptic digestion protocol including the following essential steps: Protein disulfide bonds were reduced with dithiothreitol (6.5 mM DTT in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) for 1 h at 6 0 ∘ C; the sample was alkylated by incubation with 54 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min in the dark at room temperature; proteins trapped in the gel matrix were digested with 1.25 μg of sequencing grade porcine trypsin (Promega) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 3 7 ∘ C for 20 h; the resulting peptides were desalted in C18 BioPureSPN mini columns (The Nest Group, Inc.), eluted with Buffer B (50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and finally recovered in 12.5 μl of Buffer A (0.1% formic acid) supplemented with 1:50 (v:v) of iRT peptides ( Escher et al., 2012 20. Escher, C. ∙ Reiter, L. ∙ MacLean, B. ... Using iRT, a normalized retention time for more targeted measurement of peptides Proteomics. 2012; 12 :1111-1121 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ). The samples were transferred to MS vials for further mass-spectrometric analysis.
Cell lysates were adjusted to 4 mg/mL protein concentration with the Lysis Buffer (see “ Affinity isolation of NUP complexes ”) as determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) bassed on the Bradford method. Samples (typically 50 μl) were diluted with 200 μl of 7M guanidine chloride (GuHCl) in 100 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate (AmBic) to reach a final GuHCl concentration of 5.6 M. The disulfide bonds were reduced by DTT supplemented to 6.5 mM f.c. at 3 7 ∘ C for 30 min and alkylated with iodoacetamide supplemented to 54 mM f.c. at 3 0 ∘ C in the dark for 30 min. The samples were then diluted with 100 mM AmBic to reach a final GuHCl concentration of 1M and digested with sequencing grade porcine trypsin (Promega, 1:100 trypsin:protein) at 3 7 ∘ C for 20 h. Digestion was stopped by adding 3% (v/v) of 100% formic acid (pH ∼ 2 . 0 ). Peptides were desalted using BioPureSPN MACRO spin columns (The Nest Group, Inc.) according to the following procedure: Cartridges were activated with one volume (200 μl) of 100% methanol, washed with two volumes of Buffer B (50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and equilibrated with three volumes of Buffer A (0.1% formic acid). The acidified peptides were loaded twice on the cartridge, washed with three volumes Buffer A and eluted with two volumes Buffer B. Peptides were dried in a speedvac concentrator and re-solubilized in 50 μl of Buffer A. Peptide concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/mL with Buffer A based on OD 280 . The samples were then transferred to MS vials and spiked with 1:50 (v:v) of iRT peptides ( Escher et al., 2012 20. Escher, C. ∙ Reiter, L. ∙ MacLean, B. ... Using iRT, a normalized retention time for more targeted measurement of peptides Proteomics. 2012; 12 :1111-1121 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the mass spectrometry acquisition.
Nanoflow LC-MS/MS measurements were carried out either (i) on an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher) coupled to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a Nanospray Flex ion source or (ii) on an Acquity M-Class system (Waters) coupled to a Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer) equipped with a Nanospray Flex ion source. In both cases, the peptides were separated on a 75 μm-diameter, 40 cm-long new Objective emitter packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ resin (1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch) placed in a column oven at 5 0 ∘ C and eluted at 300nl/min using a linear gradient of 5-to-30% Buffer A for 120min (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B: 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) on the Q Exactive Plus was performed using a top20 method, with 30 s dynamic exclusion. The resolution of the Orbitrap analyzer was set to 70,000 for MS1 and 17,500 for and MS2, and the AGC target was set to 3 × 1 0 6 in MS1 (maximum injection time: 64 ms), and 1 0 5 in MS2 (maximum injection time: 55 ms). The mass range monitored was 350-1500 m/z in MS1 and 200-2000 m/z in MS2. MS2 acquisition was performed with a precursor isolation width of 1.4 m/z and a normalized collision energy of 25%. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) on the Q Exactive Plus used 40 fixed precursor isolation windows with 1 Da overlap ( Table S2 ). The resolution of the Orbitrap analyzer was set to 70,000 for MS1 and 35,000 for and MS2, with AGC targets of 3 × 1 0 6 in MS1 (max injection time: 120 ms) and 3 × 1 0 6 in MS2 (maximum injection time: 60 ms). The mass range monitored was 350-1500 m/z in MS1 and was set to fixed first mass at 150 m/z in MS2. The normalized collision energy was set to HCD at 25%. Data-dependent acquisition on the Lumos was performed using the top speed mode (3 s cycle time), with 30 s dynamic exclusion. The resolution of the Orbitrap analyzer was set to 120,000 for MS1 and 30,000 for and MS2, with AGC targets of 4 × 1 0 5 in MS1 (max injection time: 100 ms), and 1 0 5 in MS2 (maximum injection time: 54 ms). The mass range monitored in MS1 was 350-1400 m/z and set to “first mass” at 110 m/z in MS2. MS2 acquisition was performed with a precursor isolation width of 1.6 m/z and the collision energy was set to HCD at 28%. Data-independent acquisition on the Lumos used 41 variable precursor isolation windows with 1 Da overlap ( Table S2 ). The resolution of the Orbitrap analyzer was set to 120,000 for MS1 and 30,000 for and MS2, with AGC targets of 2 × 1 0 5 in MS1 (max injection time: 100 ms) and 5 × 1 0 5 in MS2 (maximum injection time: 50 ms). The mass range monitored in MS1 was 350-1500 m/z and in MS2 200-1800 m/z for DIA. The collision energy was set to HCD at 28%. Parallel reaction monitoring on the Lumos was performed using a 1.2 Da precursor isolation width using two consecutive target lists for each sample ( Table S2 ). The resolution of the Orbitrap analyzer was set to 120,000 for MS1 and 60,000 for and MS2, with AGC targets of 2 × 1 0 5 in MS1 (max injection time: 100 ms) and 5 × 1 0 5 in MS2 (maximum injection time: 118 ms). The mass range monitored was 350-1500 m/z for MS1 and 200-1800 m/z for MS2. The collision energy was set to HCD at 28%. All raw DDA and DIA datasets are uploaded to the PRIDE repository (PRIDE: PXD018034).
Spectral libraries were generated based on the total of 20 DDA datasets comprising two DDA spectra for each NUP bait. The spectra were obtained from pooled biological replicates of zero time point samples. The DDA searches and spectral library generation were performed essentially as described in Schubert et al. (2015) 66. Schubert, O.T. ∙ Gillet, L.C. ∙ Collins, B.C. ... Building high-quality assay libraries for targeted analysis of SWATH MS data Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :426-441 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar . In short, the raw DDA files were converted to mzXML using the instrument-setup with msconvert (Proteowizzard v 3.0.18304) and the mzXML subsequently converted to mgf using MzXML2search (TPP v5.0.0). The mzXML files were searched with Comet (2018.01 rev. 2) and the mgf files were searched with Mascot (2.5.1) using the SGD database (downloaded 13.10.2015) containing 6,713 proteins plus one protein entry for the concatenated sequence of the iRT peptides and for S-TEV-ZZ affinity tag, and as many decoy protein entries generated by pseudo-reversing the tryptic peptide sequences. The search parameters were as follows: ± 2 5 ppm tolerance for MS1 and default comet “high res” parameters for MS2, fixed cysteine carbamidomethylation, variable methionine oxidation, semi-tryptic and 2 missed cleavages allowed. The comet search results were further processed using peptideProphet (TPP v5.0.0) ( Keller et al., 2002 32. Keller, A. ∙ Nesvizhskii, A.I. ∙ Kolker, E. ... Empirical statistical model to estimate the accuracy of peptide identifications made by MS/MS and database search Anal. Chem. 2002; 74 :5383-5392 Crossref Scopus (4069) PubMed Google Scholar ) and filtered to 1% false discovery rate. A consensus spectral library was then generated using spectraST ( Lam et al., 2008 36. Lam, H. ∙ Deutsch, E.W. ∙ Eddes, J.S. ... Building consensus spectral libraries for peptide identification in proteomics Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :873-875 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the assay library thereof was exported using the spectrast2tsv.py script ( Schubert et al., 2015 66. Schubert, O.T. ∙ Gillet, L.C. ∙ Collins, B.C. ... Building high-quality assay libraries for targeted analysis of SWATH MS data Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :426-441 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following parameters: 5 highest intensity fragments (of charge 1+ or 2+) per peptide, within the mass range 350-2000 m/z, y ions only with assays for peptides with heavy-labeled lysines (K+8.014199) appended. The final library contained assays for 70,073 peptide precursors (thereof 64,764 proteotypic assay precursors covering 5,748 unique proteins). The assay library was exported to tsv, curated for decoy proteins and processed for peptide-centric DIA data extraction using Spectronaut. DIA data were extracted with the above mentioned assay library with Spectronaut 13 ( Bruderer et al., 2015 9. Bruderer, R. ∙ Bernhardt, O.M. ∙ Gandhi, T. ... Extending the limits of quantitative proteome profiling with data-independent acquisition and application to acetaminophen-treated three-dimensional liver microtissues Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14 :1400-1410 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (710) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Biognosys) using the default settings, except the following options: the machine learning was set to ”across experiment”; the ”cross run normalization” was switched off; the protein inference was set to ”From protein-db matching” with ”semi-specific” digestion type and specifying our SGD database to match our DDA search parameters. The Spectronaut quantification reports at the precursor and fragment ion levels (uploaded to the PRIDE repository (PRIDE: PXD018034)) were exported for further processing in R.
The parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) data analysis was aimed at quantifying heavy and light peptides for a set of selected proteins directly from the total source cell lysates. The candidates were selected based on the set of peptides showing the most robust detection characteristics in the DIA AP-MS datasets (low CV, low number of missing values and good consistency with the other peptides of the same protein). The retention times of those were re-aligned from the DIA measurement using the iRT peptides spiked in the samples, allowing for a ± 4 min scheduling for the PRM measurements. A few additional PRM assays for peptides of MLP1 not reported in our lirabry were also manually generated in Skyline to increase MLP1 sequence coverage ( Table S2 ). The PRM data of the peptide candidate set measured in total cell lysates was imported into Skyline and manually inspected: peptide peak groups showing the best peak shape, co-elution of the light and heavy peak groups and signal-to-noise intensity characteristics were selected as the final set of PRM peptide candidates. Those peptides were then split homogeneously into two scheduled PRM target lists and used for the final data acquisition. The acquired PRM measurements were imported into Skyline and the data was manually inspected and integrated. Special attention was given to ensure the co-elution of the light and heavy fragments, and the consistency of the boundaries for the peak integration across the different samples. The resulting Skyline document has been uploaded to the PRIDE repository (PRIDE: PXD018034). The resulting peak areas for the heavy and light forms of the peptides were exported with Skyline and further analyzed in R as described in in the ”Quantification of protein labeling” section.
The quantification pipeline for protein labeling in KARMA assays was implemented in R (see 20200225_Mlp1_labeling.R and 20200225_10_bait_labeling.R). It includes three main steps: (1) quantification of single lysine (K1) and double lysine (K2) proteotypic precursor ion intensities; (2) selection of high-quality precursor ions; (3) computation of consensus protein labeling in K1 and K2 channels based on the respective precursor ion intensities. (1) Initially, the MS2 fragments, originating from K1 and K2 precursor ions were selected, and pre-filtered to ensure presence of all lysine residues. For example, for K2 precursors, MS2 fragments containing single or no lysine residues were excluded from the analysis. Light and Heavy precursor ion intensities were then computed as the intensity sums over the relevant MS2 fragments. The precursor ions were characterized by the same MS2 fragments across all analyzed samples. (2) The whole dataset was then split into separate KARMA experiments according to different baits each including post-labeling time series with three biological replicates per time point. Of note, zero time point samples were excluded due to lack of heavy lysine. Selection of high-quality precursor ions was carried out for each KARMA experiment separately in three consequent rounds. First, poorly detected ions, whose heavy and light species were found in less than two out of three biological replicates in any of the post-labeling time points, were discarded. This was followed by discarding data for poorly covered proteins that were represented by less than three precursor ions in any of the post-labeling samples. Lastly, noisy precursor ions were filtered out as follows: Labeling of the remaining precursor ions was computed for each KARMA sample as 𝐻 / ( 𝐻 + 𝐿 ) , where H and L are the summed intensities of the constituent heavy and light MS2 fragment ions respectively. Within each KARMA sample the precursor labeling values were further split into groups according to the protein origin. For each protein in a sample we computed median labeling value of the constituent precursors. A set of such protein’s median values obtained with a given bait for all the time points and biological replicates defined the median protein labeling profile . Analogous to this, individual precursor ions were characterized by their own labeling profiles. The MSE of the constituent precursor labeling profiles from the median was used as the filtration criterion, to exclude 50% precursor ions with the highest MSE (see Figure S1 A as an example). Protein labeling was then defined based on the remaining high-quality precursor ions as 𝐻 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 / ( 𝐻 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 + 𝐿 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ) , where 𝐻 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 and 𝐿 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 are summed intensities of the protein-born heavy and light precursor ions, respectively ( Table S4 ). For the cell-intermixing assay ( Figures S1 D and S1E) we exclusively considered K1 precursor ions and excluded all ions that were not identified in at least 2 out of 4 samples. From the remaining precursor ions we only considered those with metabolic labeling values in the interquartile range 𝑄 3 − 𝑄 1 for each protein, replicate and lysis condition (see Lysintermixing_correction.R). Protein labeling was then computed as 𝐻 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 / ( 𝐻 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 + 𝐿 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ) ( Table S4 ). Labeling of proteins in source cell lysates was defined based on the chromatographic peak intensities of single lysine precursor ions ( Table S4 ) obtained with parallel reaction monitoring (see ”Analysis of mass-spectrometry data”) as 𝐻 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 / ( 𝐻 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 + 𝐿 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ) , where 𝐻 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 and 𝐿 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 are summed intensities of heavy and light precursor ions.
Analysis of NUP isolation specificity in KARMA affinity pulldowns was implemented in R (see 20200225_Specific_enrichment.R). The NUP isolation specificity was evaluated based on the MS2 fragment intensities extracted with a complementary spectral library, comprising only light lysine variants of both y- and b-type ions, from zero time point DIA datasets (ten NUP baits samples plus blank ZZ-tag samples). The ion quality filtration and intensity quantification was performed similar to as in ”Quantification of protein labeling.” The intensities of proteotypic precursor ions were determined as described in step (1) of ”Quantification of protein labeling” except that selection of K1 and K2 fragments was omitted. The high-quality precursor ions were identified as in step (2) of ”Quantification of protein labeling” except that (i) ions detected in less than 17 out of 34 samples were considered poorly detected, (ii) the exclusion limit for poorly covered proteins was set to four precursor ions per protein altogether (instead of three per sample), and (iii) filtration of noisy precursor ions was based on the fractional abundance profiles, representing precursor ion intensity values normalized for the summed value across all samples. Protein abundances were computed as in step (3) of ”Quantification of protein labeling” albeit using summed intensities of the constituent high-quality precursor ions as readouts. Protein abundances were internally (within the same sample) normalized for the abundance of the bait S-TEV-ZZ affinity tag. Abundances of missing proteins were set to zero. Normalized abundances were used as inputs for SAINTq software ( Teo et al., 2016 69. Teo, G. ∙ Koh, H. ∙ Fermin, D. ... SAINTq: Scoring protein-protein interactions in affinity purification - mass spectrometry experiments with fragment or peptide intensity data Proteomics. 2016; 16 :2238-2245 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) to determine false discovery rates of NUPs in the pulldown samples (probabilities of being non-specifically purified with a given bait) ( Figure S2 F). To compute specific enrichments ( Figure S2 E) the normalized protein abundances were averaged over the biological replicates and expressed as l o g 1 0 fold-changes to the average values obtained in blank ZZ-tag pulldowns.
Identification of NUP assembly groups was performed by hierarchical clustering using complete linkage function and correlation distance as a distance measure (see 20200225_Labeling_profiles_clustering.R). The correlation distance for two proteins was computed as ( 1 − 𝑟 ) / 2 , where r is a correlation coefficient for a set of the paired proteins’ labeling values across several KARMA assays. For two proteins s takes values from 0 to 1 and, therefore, protein pairs with highly correlated labeling would display low correlation distance and vice versa. Clusters of NUPs with highly correlated labeling represent signatures for assembly groups. The correlation distance matrices between all the NUP pairs, necessary for correlation clustering, were computed separately for each post-labeling time point (either 30, 60, or 90 min). The correlation distance was evaluated for every NUP pair by bootstrapping over 1,000 sub-samples each composed of 10 KARMA assays (one per bait) where for every bait the respective KARMA assay was picked at random from the three biological replicates. For calculating p values of the correlation distances we employed the same bootstrapping approach. For each protein we generated a decoy distribution of correlation distances from 100,000 sub-samples as described above, except that labeling values of a given protein were paired each time with a value of a randomly picked protein from the same KARMA assay. p values were computed as the fraction of decoy correlation distances lower than observed for a given protein pair. Since the decoy distributions were slightly different for different proteins, the correlation distance for each pair would be characterized by two slightly different p values. As the p value cutoff ( < 0 . 0 0 1 , < 0 . 0 1 , < 0 . 0 5 , ≥ 0 . 0 5 ) we used the minimal of the two.
In this section, we present the simplest Kinetic State Model (KSM) that describes the labeling fractions of a protein as a 2-step process. Although very simple, and having only one tunable parameter, this model captures the dynamics of most of the NUPs in our KARMA assays. In the following sections, we present solutions for more elaborate cases (such as ones with reversibility and/or more steps).
As a simplified model, we describe the maturation of a single prey (a protein or cluster of proteins) that joins the complex at a specific well-defined point, as an irreversible process with two states. 𝑣 1 → 𝑆 1 ↓ 𝑣 2 → 𝑆 2 ↓ (1)
The first state ( 𝑆 1 ) will be denoted the maturation state , and represents all the maturation steps the prey undergoes before joining the mature complex that contains the bait. The mature state ( 𝑆 2 ) represents all instances where the prey and bait are bound (either directly, or indirectly by other proteins). Obviously, the latter state also contains the fully mature complex itself (see Figure 1 D).
We assume that this system is in a balanced growth state (typical for exponentially growing cells), where all protein pools (including protein complexes and sub-complexes) are at steady state, and that protein degradation plays an insignificant role ( Huang et al., 2014 30. Huang, L. ∙ Kim, D. ∙ Liu, X. ... Estimating relative changes of metabolic fluxes PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10 :e1003958 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, there is an extra dilution flux for each pool proportional to its size, where the proportionality factor is the growth rate – μ. The system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describing the concentrations over time is: 0 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑣 1 − 𝑣 2 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 1 (2) 0 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑣 2 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2
where 𝑣 1 is the rate at which the protein is synthesized, 𝑣 2 is the rate of co-assembly between the prey and the bait, and 𝑠 1 and 𝑠 2 are the concentrations of the prey in the two corresponding states. We can thus conclude that 𝑣 2 = 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 and 𝑣 1 = 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 ) .
The next step would be to write down the ODE system for the labeling of the two states. Unlike the total concentrations of the proteins, the labeled fractions are not assumed to be in steady-state, but rather start as completely unlabeled at time 𝑡 = 0 and gradually approach full labeling. We will later show how this dynamic can be described analytically (by solving the ODE system).
First, we denote the labeling fractions, as functions of time, by: 𝑓 𝑖 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ≡ 𝑠 1 𝑖 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) / ( 𝑠 0 𝑖 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑠 1 𝑖 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ) = 𝑠 1 𝑖 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) / 𝑠 𝑖 (where the symbols 𝑠 0 𝑖 and 𝑠 1 𝑖 are the unlabeled and labeled concentrations of 𝑆 𝑖 ). Then: 𝑠 1 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 1 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 1 ⋅ 𝑣 1 − 𝑓 1 ⋅ 𝑣 2 − 𝑓 1 ⋅ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 1 ⁢ = 𝜇 ⋅ ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 ) − 𝑓 1 ⋅ ( 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 1 + 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 ) ⁢ = 𝜇 ⋅ ( 1 − 𝑓 1 ) ⋅ ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 ) 𝑠 2 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 1 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑓 1 ⋅ 𝑣 2 − 𝑓 2 ⋅ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 = 𝜇 ⋅ ( 𝑓 1 − 𝑓 2 ) ⋅ 𝑠 2 (3)
which can be simplified to: 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝜇 ⋅ 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 𝑠 1 ⋅ ( 1 − 𝑓 1 ) 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝜇 ⋅ ( 𝑓 1 − 𝑓 2 ) (4)
which is equivalent to Equations 7 and 8 in ( Chen et al., 2012 13. Chen, S.S. ∙ Sperling, E. ∙ Silverman, J.M. ... Measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8 :3325-3334 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we will mostly use the more generalizable matrix notation: 𝑑 ⁢ → 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = → 𝑓 ⁢ 𝐌 + → 𝑔 (5)
where we define 𝜑 ≡ 𝑠 1 / ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 ) (i.e., the Effective Maturation Pool) and → 𝑓 ≡ [ 𝑓 1 𝑓 2 ] ⁢ 𝐌 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ [ − 1 / 𝜑 1 0 − 1 ] ⁢ → 𝑔 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ [ 1 / 𝜑 0 ] . (6)
This ODE is an in-homogeneous first order linear system, and has a general solution ( Young et al., 2008 82. Young, J.D. ∙ Walther, J.L. ∙ Antoniewicz, M.R. ... An elementary metabolite unit (EMU) based method of isotopically nonstationary flux analysis Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2008; 99 :686-699 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ): → 𝑓 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = → 𝑓 ⁡ ( 0 ) ⋅ 𝑒 𝐌 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) + ∫ 𝑡 0 → 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) ⁢ 𝑒 𝐌 ⁡ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 (7)
Since in our case, the initial condition is → 𝑓 ⁡ ( 0 ) = 0 , we can drop the first term. In addition, → 𝑔 is constant, and therefore the integral can be solved explicitly ( Figures S4 A and S4B): → 𝑓 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = → 𝑔 ⁢ 𝐌 − 1 ⁢ ( 𝑒 𝐌 ⁢ 𝑡 − 𝐈 ) (8)
We solved this equation using sympy ( Meurer et al., 2017 44. Meurer, A. ∙ Smith, C.P. ∙ Paprocki, M. ... SymPy: symbolic computing in Python PeerJ Comput. Sci. 2017; 3 :e103 Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar ), and express → 𝑓 as a function of t without need for matrix operations: 𝑓 1 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 1 − 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 𝑓 2 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 1 − 1 1 − 𝜑 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + 𝜑 1 − 𝜑 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 (9)
This result recapitulates previous studies which apply non-stationary isotopic labeling as an approach to estimate fluxes and relative pool sizes ( Young et al., 2008 82. Young, J.D. ∙ Walther, J.L. ∙ Antoniewicz, M.R. ... An elementary metabolite unit (EMU) based method of isotopically nonstationary flux analysis Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2008; 99 :686-699 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar , Chen et al., 2012 13. Chen, S.S. ∙ Sperling, E. ∙ Silverman, J.M. ...

Biol. 2014; 10 :e1003958 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). We note, that φ represents the percentage of the Effective Maturation Pool (EMP) out of the total of both pools, while in ( Chen et al., 2012 13. Chen, S.S. ∙ Sperling, E. ∙ Silverman, J.M. ... Measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8 :3325-3334 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) the free parameter ( P ) represents their ratio. Using the relationship 𝜙 ≡ P / ( 1 + P ) , one can see that the equations derived here are equivalent to the ones in ( Chen et al., 2012 13. Chen, S.S. ∙ Sperling, E. ∙ Silverman, J.M. ... Measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8 :3325-3334 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this section, we relax our assumption that the reaction from 𝑆 1 to 𝑆 2 is irreversible. Such a two-step model with reversibility can be used to describe the labeling kinetics for a dynamic protein that reversibly detaches form a bait with a certain off-rate 𝐾 o f f . We first solve the general case where the reverse flux is an extra parameter 𝑣 − 2 , and will later show how it applies to dynamic proteins.
𝑣 1 → 𝑆 1 ↓ 𝑣 2 ⇄ 𝑣 − 2 𝑆 2 ↓
As before, we assume that the system is at balanced growth, so that the dilution fluxes are still proportional to their pool sizes, i.e., 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑖 . So: 𝑣 1 = 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 ) 𝑣 2 = 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 + 𝑣 − 2 (10)
Now, we can rewrite the ODE system for the labeling fractions: 𝑠 1 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 1 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑣 1 − 𝑓 1 ⁢ 𝑣 2 − 𝑓 1 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 1 + 𝑓 2 ⁢ 𝑣 − 2 ⁢ = 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 ) − 𝑓 1 ⁢ ( 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 1 + 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 ) + ( 𝑓 2 − 𝑓 1 ) ⁢ 𝑣 − 2 ⁢ = 𝜇 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑓 1 ) ⁢ ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 ) + ( 𝑓 2 − 𝑓 1 ) ⁢ 𝑣 − 2 𝑠 2 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 1 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑓 1 ⁢ 𝑣 2 − 𝑓 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 − 𝑓 2 ⁢ 𝑣 − 2 ⁢ = 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑓 1 − 𝑓 2 ) ⁢ 𝑠 2 + ( 𝑓 1 − 𝑓 2 ) ⁢ 𝑣 − 2 (11)
For simplicity, we define 𝑥 ≡ 𝑣 − 2 / ( 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 ) and 𝜑 ≡ 𝑠 1 / ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 ) , therefore: 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝜇 𝜙 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑓 1 ) + 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑠 2 𝑠 1 ⁢ ( 𝑓 2 − 𝑓 1 ) = 𝜇 𝜙 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑓 1 ) + 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ ( 1 / 𝜙 − 1 ) ⁢ ( 𝑓 2 − 𝑓 1 ) 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑓 1 − 𝑓 2 ) + 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ ( 𝑓 1 − 𝑓 2 ) (12) Where we use that fact that 𝑠 2 / 𝑠 1 = ( 1 / 𝜙 − 1 ) .
As before, we turn to matrix notation in order to solve the ODE system 𝑑 ⁢ → 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = → 𝑓 ⁢ 𝐌 + → 𝑔 𝐌 = 𝜇 ⋅ [ − 1 / 𝜑 − 𝑥 ⁢ ( 1 / 𝜑 − 1 ) 1 + 𝑥 𝑥 ⁢ ( 1 / 𝜑 − 1 ) − 1 − 𝑥 ] ⁢ → 𝑔 = 𝜇 ⋅ [ 1 / 𝜑 0 ] (13)
and use sympy ( Meurer et al., 2017 44. Meurer, A. ∙ Smith, C.P. ∙ Paprocki, M. ... SymPy: symbolic computing in Python PeerJ Comput. Sci. 2017; 3 :e103 Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar ) to find the analytical solution: 𝑓 1 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 1 − 𝑥 1 + 𝑥 − 𝜑 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + 1 − 𝜑 1 + 𝑥 − 𝜑 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) / 𝜑 𝑓 2 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 1 − 1 + 𝑥 1 + 𝑥 − 𝜑 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + 𝜑 1 + 𝑥 − 𝜑 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) / 𝜑 (14)
If we define 𝜑 ′ ≡ 𝜑 / ( 1 + 𝑥 ) , the expression for 𝑓 2 can be further simplified: 𝑓 2 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 1 − 1 1 − 𝜑 ′ ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + 𝜑 ′ 1 − 𝜑 ′ ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 ′ (15)
which is exactly the same form as Equation 9 . In conclusion, if we can only observe the labeling of state 𝑆 2 , adding reversibility to the model (parameterized by x ) is equivalent to reducing the EMP by a factor of 1 + 𝑥 .
In the case of a dynamic protein with a known 𝐾 o f f rate, the backward flux of the protein in the KSM is given by 𝑣 − 2 ≡ 𝐾 o f f ⋅ 𝑠 2 . Therefore, 𝑥 = 𝐾 o f f / 𝜇 – i.e., the ratio between the off-rate and the cell’s growth rate – and 𝜑 ′ becomes 𝜑 / ( 1 + 𝐾 o f f / 𝜇 ) . The labeling kinetics of a dynamic protein would therefore completely mimic a non-dynamic protein albeit with a smaller EMP. As a consequence, very dynamic proteins would be labeled in KARMA assays indistinguishably form total cell lysates. Additionally, fitting labeling kinetic data with an irreversible KSM would always underestimate EMPs of dynamic proteins by a factor of 1 + 𝐾 o f f / 𝜇 .
Assuming a 90 min duplication time (i.e., 𝜇 ∼ 1 0 − 2 ⁢ m i n − 1 ) and comparing it to the NPC off-rates measured previously for several NUPs and NTRs in mammals ( Rabut et al., 2004 59. Rabut, G. ∙ Doye, V. ∙ Ellenberg, J. Mapping the dynamic organization of the nuclear pore complex inside single living cells Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6 :1114-1121 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ), we can conclude that the labeling kinetics of the core NUPs ( 𝐾 o f f ∼ 1 0 − 4 ⁢ m i n − 1 ) would be mostly unaffected (less than a 1% change). At the same time, dynamic NUPs (with 𝐾 o f f ∼ 1 0 − 1 ⁢ m i n − 1 ) would be labeled much faster (as if their EMP was ∼ 10 times smaller than it really is). The labeling of the extremely dynamic NTRs (with 𝐾 o f f ≈ 3 0 ⁢ m i n − 1 ) would seem as if they had an insignificant EMP and thus would be virtually indistinguishable from the labeling of full cell lysates (see Figure 2 F).
We consider a case where the maturation state ( 𝑆 1 ) undergoes protein degradation, at a rate Ω . The only change to the model would be that the dilution flux for that state ( 𝜇 ⋅ 𝑠 1 ) would increase to ( 𝜇 + Ω ) ⋅ 𝑠 1 and therefore increase 𝑣 1 by the same amount. The other flux ( 𝑣 2 ) would remain unchanged. If we reconstruct the ODE system given this change we get: → 𝑓 ≡ [ 𝑓 1 𝑓 2 ] 𝐌 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ [ − 1 / 𝜑 − Ω / 𝜇 1 0 − 1 ] → 𝑔 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ [ 1 / 𝜑 + Ω / 𝜇 0 ] . (16)
Therefore, one can see that, by defining 𝜑 ′ ≡ ( 𝜑 − 1 + Ω / 𝜇 ) − 1 , we get an equivalent system to the standard case with no degradation: → 𝑓 ≡ [ 𝑓 1 𝑓 2 ] 𝐌 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ [ − 1 / 𝜑 ′ 1 0 − 1 ] → 𝑔 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ [ 1 / 𝜑 ′ 0 ] . (17)
In conclusion, in cases where the maturation state undergoes protein degradation in significant rates, the effect on labeling would be equivalent to the effect of a smaller EMP or, alternatively, to a reversible model (as discussed in the previous section).
We define the maturation time 𝑡 1 / 2 as the time after which a protein that starts in 𝑆 1 will have a 50% chance of reaching 𝑆 2 . In the 2-step reversible model, the net flux from 𝑆 1 to 𝑆 2 is 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) , and therefore the chance of any molecule in 𝑆 1 to make the transition in a short time interval 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 is 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 / 𝑠 1 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 . Furthermore, we can replace 𝑠 2 / 𝑠 1 with 1 / 𝜑 1 − 1 .
We denote by 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) , the probability that our protein of interest has moved to 𝑆 2 (matured) before time t . The chance of making the transition exactly between t and 𝑡 + 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 is the probability it did not happen already before t (which is 1 − 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ) times the probability we just calculated earlier: 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑃 = 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑡 + 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 ) − 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = ( 1 − 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ) ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 2 / 𝑠 1 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 ∫ 𝑇 0 1 1 − 𝑃 𝑑 𝑃 = ∫ 𝑇 0 𝑠 2 / 𝑠 1 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) 𝑑 𝑡 − l n ⁡ ( 1 − 𝑃 ) = 𝑠 2 / 𝑠 1 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) ⁢ 𝑡 = ( 1 / 𝜑 − 1 ) ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) ⁢ 𝑡 𝑡 = − l n ⁡ ( 1 − 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ) 𝜇 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) ⁢ 𝜑 1 − 𝜑 . (18)
Now, to calculate 𝑡 1 / 2 we simply assign 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) the value of 0.5: 𝑡 1 / 2 = − l n ⁡ ( 1 − 0 . 5 ) 𝜇 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑥 ) ⁢ 𝜑 1 − 𝜑 = l n ⁡ 2 𝜇 ⋅ 𝜑 ( 1 + 𝑥 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜑 ) = 𝑡 𝐷 1 + 𝑥 ⋅ 𝜑 1 − 𝜑 (19)
where we used the fact that doubling time ( 𝑡 𝐷 ) is defined as l n ⁡ 2 / 𝜇 .
Now, imagine that we fit the EMPs using data while assuming that the reactions are irreversible. In this case, we are going to underestimate φ by a factor of ( 1 + 𝑥 ) , when trying to estimate 𝑡 1 / 2 . To understand how this assumption affects the result, we define our new estimate 𝑡 ′ 1 / 2 using 𝜑 ′ (assuming no reversibility, i.e., 𝑥 ′ = 0 ) and then replace 𝜑 ′ with 𝜑 / ( 1 + 𝑥 ) : 𝑡 ′ 1 / 2 ≡ 𝑡 𝐷 ⋅ 𝜑 ′ 1 − 𝜑 ′ = 𝑡 𝐷 ⋅ 𝜑 / ( 1 + 𝑥 ) 1 − 𝜑 / ( 1 + 𝑥 ) = 𝑡 𝐷 1 + 𝑥 ⋅ 𝜑 1 − 𝜑 ⋅ 1 − 𝜑 1 − 𝜑 / ( 1 + 𝑥 ) ⁢ = 𝑡 1 / 2 ⋅ 1 − 𝜑 1 − 𝜑 / ( 1 + 𝑥 ) (20)
and since 1 ≥ 1 − 𝜑 1 − 𝜑 / ( 1 + 𝑥 ) > 1 − 𝜑 , we get that: 1 ≥ 𝑡 ′ 1 / 2 𝑡 1 / 2 > 1 − 𝜑 . (21)
In other words, if we use an irreversible model to find the maturation time, we might underestimate it, but not by more than a factor of 1 − 𝜑 . However, only highly dynamic proteins (i.e., with a large x value) will approach this upper bound, and we expect that this underestimation is not significant for the vast majority of NUPs.
Whether the reaction between 𝑆 1 and 𝑆 2 is reversible or not, the following will always hold:
𝑓 1 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ≥ 𝑓 2 ⁡ ( 𝑡 )
and since we defined ⟨ 𝑓 ⟩ as the average labeled fraction, it must lie somewhere in between the two values:
𝑓 1 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ≥ ⟨ 𝑓 ⟩ ≥ 𝑓 2 ⁡ ( 𝑡 )
However, in some of our measurements of 𝑓 2 , we find that it can surpass ⟨ 𝑓 ⟩ , which suggests that one of our assumptions is not true. The most likely suspect, is the assumption that the mature state ( 𝑆 2 ) includes all downstream instances of the protein after its maturation (i.e., joining a complex that contains the bait).
In order to address cases where 𝑓 2 > ⟨ 𝑓 ⟩ , we add one more state which we call the inaccessible state (and denoted 𝑆 3 ). It represents instances of the prey which are downstream of 𝑆 2 , but are not accessible to affinity pulldowns and therefore do not appear in the measurement of 𝑓 2 . That leads to an overestimate of 𝑓 2 , since the inaccessible ones are likely to have a lower labeled fraction (as they are at the end of the assembly line). If 𝑠 3 is large enough, it can artificially raise the value of 𝑓 2 even to be higher than ⟨ 𝑓 ⟩ .
To see this effect in mathematical terms, we extended our model to have 3 irreversible steps, and use the same approach as in the 2-step model (STAR methods, “Irreversible 2-step assembly”) to solve the time-dependent labeled fractions: 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 + 𝑠 3 ) ← → 𝑆 1 ↓ 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑠 2 + 𝑠 3 ) ← → 𝑆 2 ↓ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑠 3 → 𝑆 3 ↓
Note that we don’t consider the reversible case, because its solution is too complicated. The resulting ODE system is: 𝑑 ⁢ → 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = → 𝑓 ⁢ 𝐌 + → 𝑔 → 𝑓 ≡ [ 𝑓 1 𝑓 2 𝑓 3 ] 𝐌 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ − 1 / 𝜑 1 1 / 𝜑 2 0 0 − 1 / 𝜑 2 1 0 0 − 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ → 𝑔 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ [ 1 / 𝜑 1 0 0 ] (22)
where we define 𝜑 1 = 𝑠 1 / ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 + 𝑠 3 ) , 𝜑 2 = 𝑠 2 / ( 𝑠 2 + 𝑠 3 ) . As before, we solve it using sympy ( Meurer et al., 2017 44. Meurer, A. ∙ Smith, C.P. ∙ Paprocki, M. ... SymPy: symbolic computing in Python PeerJ Comput. Sci. 2017; 3 :e103 Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar ) to get: 𝑓 1 = 1 − 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 1 𝑓 2 = 1 − 𝜑 2 𝜑 2 − 𝜑 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 2 + 𝜑 1 𝜑 2 − 𝜑 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 1 𝑓 3 = 1 − 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 ( 1 − 𝜑 1 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜑 2 ) + 𝜑 2 2 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 2 ( 𝜑 2 − 𝜑 1 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜑 2 ) − 𝜑 2 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 1 ( 𝜑 2 − 𝜑 1 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜑 1 ) (23)
A graphical example for the effect of the inaccessible state is shown in Figure S4 C. We can conclude that 𝑓 2 decreases with 𝜑 1 as well as 𝜑 2 .
Although using the matrix notation for the KSM fitting procedure ensures the numerical stability of the ODE solution, we can also analytically solve Equation 22 for limit of 𝜑 1 = 𝜑 2 ( Equation 23 cannot be used since 𝑓 2 and 𝑓 3 are undefined due to division by 0). The reason is that the Jordan normal form of 𝐌 is not diagonal, and the solution for its exponent is different. However, using sympy ( Meurer et al., 2017 44. Meurer, A. ∙ Smith, C.P. ∙ Paprocki, M. ... SymPy: symbolic computing in Python PeerJ Comput. Sci. 2017; 3 :e103 Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar ) for this special case, we derive the following solution ( Figure S4 D): 𝑓 2 = 1 − ( 1 + 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜑 2 ) ⋅ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜑 2 (24)
Returning to the general case, it is noteworthy, that even though 𝑓 2 has two degrees of freedom ( 𝜑 1 and 𝜑 2 ), the function is almost redundant in parameter space, meaning that the shape of 𝑓 2 is almost constant if 𝜑 1 ⋅ 𝜑 2 = c o n s t . Figure S4 E shows an example for a range of values, where 𝜑 1 ⋅ 𝜑 2 = 0 . 3 6 . We also compare that to the limit 𝜑 1 = 𝜑 2 = 0 . 6 which is depicted based on Equation 24 . This means, that if we try to fit these parameters to measured data, we might not be able to distinguish between a set of nearly equivalent solutions (with the same 𝜑 1 ⋅ 𝜑 2 value).
In order to overcome this redundancy, we first try to fit the observed data using a model with no inaccessible state (i.e., 𝜑 2 = 1 ). If adding an inaccessible state to the model (i.e., unconstraining 𝜑 2 ) does not improve the fit in terms of RMSE, we keep the simpler 2-step model. In addition, whenever we do find that adding 𝜑 2 improves the fit, we always constrain 𝜑 1 < 𝜑 2 according to the assumption that inaccessible pools are much more likely to be very small (and therefore 𝜑 2 is close to 1).
We consider a system which is devoid of any heavy lysine until time 𝑡 = 0 , where we add isotopically labeled lysine to the media of the growing culture. Due to the finite size of what we denote as the Intracellular Lysine Pool (or ILP, which includes free lysine, tRNA-bound lysine and protein-bound lysine present in high-turnover peptides), the incorporation of heavy isotopes into newly translated NUPs is gradual, and follows the labeling fraction of the ILP, which we denote 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 1 − 𝑒 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 . ψ is a parameter that represents the turnover of the ILP relative to the growth rate, and depends on the ILP size and the rate of translation of stable proteins. Since we do not have reliable estimates for these values, we instead evaluated ψ by fitting labeling data obtained in our KARMA assays in a procedure described below.
We assume that the cell is at balanced growth, with a rate of μ. Consider a protein that, after trypsin digestion, is broken down to peptides that either have a single lysine, or two lysines. For the peptides with only one lysine, the two possible labeling patterns will follow these formulae: 𝑓 ( 0 ) = 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + ∫ 𝑡 0 ( 1 − 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) ) ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 = ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + ∫ 𝑡 0 𝑒 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 𝑓 ( 1 ) = ∫ 𝑡 0 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 = ∫ 𝑡 0 ( 1 − 𝑒 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 ) ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 (25)
note that only 𝑓 ( 0 ) (the fraction of peptides with a light lysine) has a positive term before the integral, since it is equal to 1 at time 𝑡 = 0 , while 𝑓 ( 1 ) (the fraction of peptides with a heavy lysine) starts at zero.
For peptides with exactly two lysines, the four possible labeling patterns will follow this set of formulae: 𝑓 ( 0 0 ) = 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + ∫ 𝑡 0 ( 1 − 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) ) 2 ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 ⁢ = 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + ∫ 𝑡 0 ( 𝑒 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 ) ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 𝑓 ( 0 1 ) = ∫ 𝑡 0 ( 1 − 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) ) ⁢ 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 ⁢ = ∫ 𝑡 0 𝑒 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑒 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 ) ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 𝑓 ( 1 0 ) = ∫ 𝑡 0 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) ) ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 = 𝑓 ( 0 1 ) 𝑓 ( 1 1 ) = ∫ 𝑡 0 𝜌 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) 2 ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝜏 = ∫ 𝑡 0 ( 1 − 𝑒 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 ) 2 ⁢ 𝜇 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑 𝜏 (26)
We can now solve the integrals: 𝑓 ( 0 ) = 𝜓 𝜓 − 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 − 1 𝜓 − 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑓 ( 1 ) = 1 − 𝜓 𝜓 − 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 + 1 𝜓 − 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑓 ( 0 0 ) = 𝜓 𝜓 − 2 ⁢ 𝑒 − 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 − 2 𝜓 − 2 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑓 ( 0 1 ) = 𝑓 ( 1 0 ) = 𝜓 𝜓 − 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 − 𝜓 𝜓 − 2 ⁢ 𝑒 − 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 + 𝜓 ( 𝜓 − 1 ) ⁢ ( 𝜓 − 2 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑓 ( 1 1 ) = 1 − 2 ⁢ 𝜓 𝜓 − 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 + 𝜓 𝜓 − 2 ⁢ 𝑒 − 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 − 2 ( 𝜓 − 1 ) ⁢ ( 𝜓 − 2 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 (27)
This solution is not defined for 𝜓 = 1 or 𝜓 = 2 , but since we expect the value of this parameter to be way below 1, we avoid such cases by constraining 𝜓 < 1 .
In our current KARMA pipeline, the two channels can measure 𝑓 ( 0 ) , 𝑓 ( 1 ) , 𝑓 ( 0 0 ) , and 𝑓 ( 1 1 ) , and only in relative terms. Therefore, we define 𝐾 1 and 𝐾 2 as the relative values: 𝐾 1 = 𝑓 ( 1 ) 𝑓 ( 0 ) + 𝑓 ( 1 ) = 𝑓 ( 1 ) = 1 − 𝜓 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 − 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜓 − 1 𝐾 2 = 𝑓 ( 1 1 ) 𝑓 ( 0 0 ) + 𝑓 ( 1 1 ) ⁢ = ( 𝜓 − 1 ) ⁢ ( 𝜓 − 2 ) − 2 ⁢ 𝜓 ⁢ ( 𝜓 − 2 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 + 𝜓 ⁢ ( 𝜓 − 1 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 − 2 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 ( 𝜓 − 1 ) ⁢ ( 𝜓 − 2 ) − 2 ⁢ 𝜓 ⁢ ( 𝜓 − 2 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 + 2 ⁢ 𝜓 ⁢ ( 𝜓 − 1 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 − 2 ⁢ 𝜓 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 (28)
Solving for 𝐾 2 as a function of 𝐾 1 is probably not possible analytically, but we can easily plot the function for several values of ψ , as shown in Figure S4 H.
Therefore, given a value of ψ , we can calculate the standardized Euclidean distance (i.e., the Euclidean distance normalize by standard error) to each of the data points by minimizing the distance to the 𝐾 1 - 𝐾 2 curve predicted by the model. The mean of all distances represents how well the model fits the data. After trying a range of ψ values, we find that the optimal ψ is equal to 0.35.
After estimating the Intracellular Lysine Pool parameter ψ , we move on to fit a KSM for the NUP baits, which is based on a 4-step model:
𝑣 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 ⟶ 𝑆 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 ↓ 𝑣 1 → 𝑆 1 ↓ 𝑣 2 → 𝑆 2 ↓ 𝑣 3 → 𝑆 3 ↓
Let 𝑠 𝑖 be the concentration associated with state 𝑆 𝑖 . At balanced growth conditions, the fluxes obey the following equations: 𝑣 1 = 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 + 𝑠 3 ) 𝑣 2 = 𝜇 ⁢ ( 𝑠 2 + 𝑠 3 ) 𝑣 3 = 𝜇 𝑠 3 (29)
Note that 𝑣 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 does not obey a similar equation, since lysine is used in many other protein synthesis reactions, and the dilution by growth is probably negligible compared to that. Fortunately, we do not need to estimate 𝑣 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 since (as we will see below) the ILP parameter ψ can be used instead.
Compared to the 2-step model (STAR methods, “Irreversible 2-step assembly”), we have two extra states (besides the maturation state 𝑆 1 and mature state 𝑆 2 ). The first is the Intracellular Lysine Pool ( 𝑆 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 ) which we have dealt with in the previous section, and an inaccessible state 𝑆 3 which we add to deal with baits that are labeled quickly.
The 𝐾 1 data in the KARMA assays represents the labeled fraction of mature states 𝑆 2 . Let → 𝑓 ≡ [ 𝑓 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑓 1 𝑓 2 𝑓 3 ] be the vector of all labeled fractions (of the 4 states). The change in → 𝑓 is described by the following ODE: 𝑑 ⁢ → 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = → 𝑓 ⁢ 𝐌 + → 𝑔 𝐌 ≡ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ − 𝑣 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 / 𝑠 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑣 1 / 𝑠 1 0 0 0 − 𝑣 1 / 𝑠 1 𝑣 2 / 𝑠 2 0 0 0 − 𝑣 2 / 𝑠 2 𝑣 3 / 𝑠 3 0 0 0 − 𝑣 3 / 𝑠 3 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ → 𝑔 ≡ [ 𝑣 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 / 𝑠 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 0 0 0 ] (30)
Now, we define 𝜓 ≡ 𝑠 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝜇 / 𝑣 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 , 𝜑 1 ≡ 𝑠 1 / ( 𝑠 1 + 𝑠 2 + 𝑠 3 ) = 𝑠 1 ⁢ 𝜇 / 𝑣 1 , and 𝜑 2 ≡ 𝑠 2 / ( 𝑠 2 + 𝑠 3 ) = 𝑠 2 ⁢ 𝜇 / 𝑣 2 . So we can rewrite the system as: 𝐌 ≡ 𝜇 ⋅ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ − 1 / 𝜓 1 / 𝜑 1 0 0 0 − 1 / 𝜑 1 1 / 𝜑 2 0 0 0 − 1 / 𝜑 2 1 0 0 0 − 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ → 𝑔 ≡ 𝜇 ⁢ [ 1 / 𝜓 0 0 0 ]
As in Equation 8 , the solution to the ODE system (when → 𝑓 ⁡ ( 0 ) = → 0 and → 𝑔 = c o n s t ) is: → 𝑓 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = → 𝑔 ⋅ 𝐌 − 1 ⁢ ( 𝑒 𝐌 ⁢ 𝑡 − 𝐈 ) (31)
Assigning the values for 𝐌 and → 𝑔 we get: → 𝑓 = 1 − [ 1 1 1 1 ] ⋅ e x p ⁡ ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ − 1 / 𝜓 1 / 𝜑 1 0 0 0 − 1 / 𝜑 1 1 / 𝜑 2 0 0 0 − 1 / 𝜑 2 1 0 0 0 − 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ t ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ (32)
Even though we can continue to derive a closed-form formula for 𝑓 2 , there are some advantages to using the matrix form. First, it is more compact, especially when the labeling of the other states are needed as well. Second, explicitly laying out the solution to the exponent of 𝐌 requires handling a few singularities (e.g., when ψ , 𝜑 1 , and 𝜑 2 have non-distinct values). Finally, it is easier to extend by adding more intermediate steps when needed. In our KARMA implementation, we use the scipy.linalg.expm ( Virtanen et al., 2020 75. Virtanen, P. ∙ Gommers, R. ∙ Oliphant, T.E. ..., SciPy 1.0 Contributors SciPy 1.0: fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :261-272 Crossref Scopus (18328) PubMed Google Scholar ) function to calculate the matrix exponent numerically.
We now have an expression for the labeling of the mature state as a function of time (and two parameters 𝜑 1 and 𝜑 2 ). However, due to the way the protein samples are extracted, it is difficult to have a precise time estimate for our KARMA assay samples. Furthermore, relying on the sampling time (and the effective growth rate of the cell culture) for calculating the value of the expected biomass increase ( 𝑒 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 ) requires absorbance measurements which are themselves error prone, and in addition complicate our experimental setup. Instead, we sought to use the labeling data itself as an internal standard in order to estimate the value of 𝑒 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 for each sample. We thus carefully selected proteins that represent the average labeling of the entire protein pool, supported by the fact that their labeling fraction at each time point did not depend on the bait, and closely matched their labeling fraction in the crude extract. In this way, we identified three internal reference proteins: Mex67, Kap95, and Kap123 (see Figure S4 I). These reference proteins bind to the NPC in an extremely highly dynamic manner completely intermixing between the bound and the unbound states. Therefore, whatever the EMP φ is, the effective 𝜑 ′ (STAR methods, “2-step assembly with reversibility”) will be close to 0. In addition, due to their dynamic nature, we assume that NTRs do not have an inaccessible state. Under these assumptions, the labeling of NTRs should follow the following equation (see Figure S4 I): 𝑓 2 = 1 − 1 1 − 𝜓 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 + 𝜓 1 − 𝜓 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜓 (33)
Using the fitted value for ψ and the collected data, we can solve for t and take the average across the three internal reference proteins. Since the inverse function does not have a closed-form analytical solution, it must be solved numerically (here, we used the pynverse package).
We were interested in comparing our time estimates (from the internal reference proteins) with direct measurements of biomass (by absorbance at 600nm). Unlike the data used for fitting ψ , which consisted only of 3 time points, here we measured the OD and purified protein samples from five time-points (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min), but only using one of the affinity handles – Mlp1. As expected, one can appreciate that the labeling significantly lags behind the biomass growth (red versus blue lines in Figure S4 I). After calculating the values for t , i.e., using the inverse of 𝑓 2 in Equation 33 , we compared the measured relative biomass increase (based on the OD measurements) to the expected increased based on the calculated time and the growth rate ( Figure S4 J). Notably, the first two OD measurements seem to underestimate the biomass growth. This discrepancy might be explained by the fast dynamics of the label at the start of the experiment, and the fact that protein extraction and affinity pull-downs cannot be done instantaneously. We decided to rely more heavily on the time estimates calculated using the labeling of the reference proteins, rather than biomass measurements which are more error prone and might have systematic biases due to the need to dilute the growing culture throughout the experiment. Another reason to use the labeling is that it is an intrinsic observation taken from the exact same sample as the analyzed data and using the same proteomic pipeline.
The method of using reference proteins as internal standards for KSM can have multiple applications beyond KARMA. Any dynamic labeling experiment requires fitting an ODE system which aims to describe the labeling as a function of time. Transforming it into a function of another intrinsic value measured together with the target labeling fraction bypasses many sources of noise and increases the robustness of the fit.
Finally, we apply the following procedure in order to fit a KSM for all our 320 KARMA assay results, i.e., 32 NUP preys × 10 baits. For each bait, the median among the reference protein labeling values is used as estimate the effective sampling time (for each time point and replicate). These values are used together with the corresponding NUP prey labeling data in our EMP estimation procedure, which is based on the KSM model as in the STAR Methods , “Irreversible 2-step assembly.” For 44 out of the 320 pairs, we find that the average labeling of the prey is higher than the average among the reference proteins. Our standard KSM model cannot explain such data (the fastest labeling possible is for 𝜑 1 = 0 , and therefore the reference proteins are already at that maximum). In these cases, we fit a KSM with 4-steps, by adding an inaccessible state (and an extra parameter 𝜑 2 ) as explained in the STAR Methods , “A 3-step process with an inaccessible state.” To avoid the observability problem, we use transformed parameters instead of 𝜑 1 and 𝜑 2 directly in the optimization: 𝑥 = 𝜑 1 ⁢ 𝜑 2 and 𝑧 = ( 1 − 𝜑 1 ⁢ 𝜑 − 1 2 ) / ( 1 − 𝜑 1 ⁢ 𝜑 2 ) . Note that z represents the extent of how close 𝜑 2 is to 𝜑 1 , in a scale between 0 and 1, i.e., when 𝜑 2 = 𝜑 1 then 𝑧 = 0 and when 𝜑 2 = 1 then 𝑧 = 1 . Both x and z are constrained to the range ( 0 , 1 ) . After fitting the labeling data, we use the following formulae to get the relative state sizes:
𝜑 1 = √ 𝑥 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑧 + 𝑧 ⁢ 𝑥 ) 𝜑 2 = √ 𝑥 / ( 1 − 𝑧 + 𝑧 ⁢ 𝑥 )
For all KSM fits, we use the Trust Region Reflective algorithm implemented by scipy.optimize.curve_fit ( Virtanen et al., 2020 75. Virtanen, P. ∙ Gommers, R. ∙ Oliphant, T.E. ..., SciPy 1.0 Contributors SciPy 1.0: fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :261-272 Crossref Scopus (18328) PubMed Google Scholar ). This function provides a co-variance matrix along with the optimum, by calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix at the optimal point. The diagonal values represent the variance in each single optimization variable. Our uncertainty estimate for 𝜑 1 are based on the square root of the variance associated with the first parameter ( 𝜑 1 in most cases, or x in the cases where an inaccessible pool was added).
A schematic overview of the process is shown in Figure S5 A. In addition, we show two examples for our KSM fit (one of which requires an inaccessible state) in Figures S5 B and S5C.
After fitting the EMP fractions using a KSM for each of the assembly groups and with respect to the different baits, we moved on to elucidate the sequence of maturation steps using a binary tree model ( Gamalinda and Woolford, 2015 23. Gamalinda, M. ∙ Woolford, Jr., J.L. Paradigms of ribosome synthesis: Lessons learned from ribosomal proteins Translation (Austin). 2015; 3 :e975018 PubMed Google Scholar ). Our approach was to iterate through all possible orders of maturation, where each order can be represented by a binary tree whose leaves are the 9 clusters. Each leaf and each vertex (i.e., a mature complex of several such leaves) in the tree is assigned a single variable which represents its relative pool size. This set of variables is then optimized to match the EMP data from the KSM fitting ( Figure 5 A and STAR methods, “Fitting Effective Maturation Pools”). Finally, we select the top 0.1% of trees that have the best match to the KSM data, and analyze the level distribution in order to estimate the sequence of maturation steps.
We considered all possible binary trees with n distinct leaves, and discard all isomorphisms (i.e., trees that can be shown to be equivalent by a series of branch rotations). To generate these trees, we used the following recursion ( Figure S5 E): • Let 𝐸 ⁢ ( 𝑛 − 1 ) be a set of all trees with 𝑛 − 1 leaves • For each tree in 𝐸 ⁢ ( 𝑛 − 1 ) and for each vertex in the tree (both branch points and leaves): – Append the new leaf ( n ) to the right of the chosen vertex, by adding a branch point and moving the original sub-tree to the left branch (see Figure S5 E). – Add the new tree to the next set of trees 𝐸 ⁡ ( 𝑛 )
This procedure avoids creating isomorphic trees, since we always add the new leaf to the right branch. Therefore, for any sub-tree, the leaf with the highest value is always on the right – i.e., the leaves are in lexicographic order. That makes it a unique tree for each isomorphism class.
This procedure also makes it easy for us to count the number of trees. First, we note that any binary tree with 𝑛 − 1 leaves has 𝑛 − 2 non-terminal vertices. So, every tree in 𝐸 ⁢ ( 𝑛 − 1 ) has exactly 2 ⁢ 𝑛 − 3 vertices and in each step of the recursion, we multiply the number of trees by this number. Obviously, 𝐸 ⁡ ( 1 ) = 1 , so the general formula is: 𝐸 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) = 𝐸 ⁡ ( 𝑛 − 1 ) ⋅ ( 2 ⁢ 𝑛 − 3 ) = … = 𝐸 ⁡ ( 1 ) ⋅ 1 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 ⋅ … ⋅ ( 2 ⁢ 𝑛 − 3 ) ⁢ = ∏ 𝑖 = 2 𝑛 ( 2 ⁢ 𝑖 − 3 ) (34)
Here are the values if 𝐸 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) for 𝑛 ≤ 9 : n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 ⁢ 𝑛 − 3 × 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 𝐸 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) 1 1 3 15 105 945 10395 135135 2027025 Open table in a new tab
Since we grouped the preys into 9 clusters, we only need to consider the 𝐸 ⁡ ( 9 ) = 2 , 0 2 7 , 0 2 5 possible binary trees. To score each tree, we assigned an abundance value to each vertex within the tree (8 branch points and 9 leaves). To calculate the EMP of a cluster-bait pair, we first identify all vertices that contain the prey cluster by following the direct path from the leaf up to the root ( Figure 5 A). We then calculate two values: (i) the sum of all corresponding abundance values on this path, and (ii) the sum of only those vertices that are below the branch point where the prey cluster and bait co-assemble. The EMP is the ratio between these two sums ( Figure 5 A). Finally, we fit the abundance values of an entire tree, by minimizing the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) between the computed EMPs from the binary tree and the ones estimated by the KSM ( Figure 5 A). For finding the global optimum, we used scipy.optimize.minimize ( Virtanen et al., 2020 75. Virtanen, P. ∙ Gommers, R. ∙ Oliphant, T.E. ..., SciPy 1.0 Contributors SciPy 1.0: fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :261-272 Crossref Scopus (18328) PubMed Google Scholar ) with several random initial values and checked for convergence.
Following cell lysis and throughout the affinity purification step, protein species can exchange between the different pools. The faster this intermixing is, the closer the labeling of the observed (post-AP) protein would be to the whole-cell lysate values. To test the robustness of our maturation kinetic model to such protein intermixing bias, we re-analyzed the NPC maturation sequence using prey labeling values that were corrected for this effect, as explained below.
In full lysates, before the AP step, measuring the labeling fraction of any given prey protein would yield approximately the same value – i.e., the labeling of the entire protein pool. As explained in section “Internal standard for KSM based on NTRs,” we use the labeling of the NTR proteins as a proxy to the full lyastes, denoted by 𝑓 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑅 . On the other hand, at the moment each sample is taken, the labeling of the prey in the mature pool (i.e., bound to the bait) would typically have different value – 𝑓 ∗ – and is described by our KSM. The effect of intermixing, is that the observed labeling of the prey in the AP – denoted f – would be somewhere in between 𝑓 ∗ (no intermixing) and 𝑓 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑅 (complete intermixing). Since all APs were conducted using the same protocol, we can reasonably assume that there is a constant intermixing factor (α) that depends on the nature of the prey protein and determines the fraction of prey molecules which is exchanged during the AP step. Thus: 𝑓 = ( 1 − 𝛼 ) ⋅ 𝑓 ∗ + 𝛼 ⋅ 𝑓 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑅 (35)
To determine the value of α, we use the results of our culture-mixing tests (see “Pulse metabolic labeling” section), where fully labeled wild-type cells were mixed with unlabeled cells expressing ZZ-tagged Mlp1 in a 1:1 ratio and subjected to AP as in KARMA. Without any intermixing, the observed protein labeling would be zero. On the other hand, if the pools would mix completely, the labeling would be 0.5. We mark the observed labeling of the AP pull-downs in these intermixing tests by 𝑓 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑥 , which would again be a weighted average between the pre-mixed labeling and the equilibrium state weighed by α, i.e. 𝑓 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑥 = ( 1 − 𝛼 ) ⋅ 0 + 𝛼 ⋅ 0 . 5 (36)
and therefore 𝛼 = 2 ⋅ 𝑓 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑥 . Combining Equations 35 and 36 we get: 𝑓 ∗ = 𝑓 − 2 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑅 1 − 2 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑥 (37)
The corrected labeling values 𝑓 ∗ were used as inputs to parametrize the KSM and evaluate the NPC maturation order as described in the above sections. If the effect of intermixing was substantial, the results based on the corrected values would differ significantly from the uncorrected ones. The resulting maturation sequence is presented in the Figures S5 H and S5I.
NPC models were generated using the dataset published in Kim et al. (2018) 34. Kim, S.J. ∙ Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Nudelman, I. ... Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex Nature. 2018; 555 :475-482 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar and visualized using USCF Chimera. Atomic models were converted to electron density maps and filtered to 20 Å using the molmap command in chimera. For NUPs without atomic models the probability density maps of the dataset were used. The pseudo-membrane was generated using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
All statistical analyses and visualizations, following the estimation of mass spectrometry peptide abundances and fluorescence microscopy image quantification were performed in R (version 3.3.1 and version 3.5.2) and Python (version 3.7). The detailed information on the statistical tests and significance thresholds can be found in the manuscript text and the “Method Details” section.
