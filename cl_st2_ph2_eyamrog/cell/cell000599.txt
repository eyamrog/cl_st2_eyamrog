Title: Host and pathogen response to bacteriophage engineered against Mycobacterium abscessus lung infection


Abstract: Summary

Two mycobacteriophages were administered intravenously to a male with treatment-refractory Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary infection and severe cystic fibrosis lung disease. The phages were engineered to enhance their capacity to lyse M. abscessus and were selected specifically as the most effective against the subject’s bacterial isolate. In the setting of compassionate use, the evidence of phage-induced lysis was observed using molecular and metabolic assays combined with clinical assessments. M. abscessus isolates pre and post-phage treatment demonstrated genetic stability, with a general decline in diversity and no increased resistance to phage or antibiotics. The anti-phage neutralizing antibody titers to one phage increased with time but did not prevent clinical improvement throughout the course of treatment. The subject received lung transplantation on day 379, and systematic culturing of the explanted lung did not detect M. abscessus . This study describes the course and associated markers of a successful phage treatment of M. abscessus in advanced lung disease.

Section: Introduction

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that selectively infect bacteria and can replicate lytically, resulting in bacterial death. Lytic phages are increasingly being evaluated for therapeutic use in difficult-to-treat infections ( Hatfull et al., 2022 26. Hatfull, G.F. ∙ Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Schooley, R.T. Phage therapy for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections Annu. Rev. Med. 2022; 73 :197-211 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mycobacterium abscessus ( M. abscessus ) is a nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) with high levels of intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance that limit treatment options and contribute toward poor outcomes ( Daley et al., 2020 8. Daley, C.L. ∙ Iaccarino, J.M. ∙ Lange, C. ... Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA clinical practice guideline Clin. Infect. Dis. 2020; 71 :905-913 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even though M. abscessus has been cited as a potentially important target of phage therapy ( Senhaji-Kacha et al., 2020 53. Senhaji-Kacha, A. ∙ Esteban, J. ∙ Garcia-Quintanilla, M. Considerations for phage therapy against Mycobacterium abscessus Front. Microbiol. 2020; 11 :609017 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), and is among the most common infections referred for phage therapy ( Aslam et al., 2020 1. Aslam, S. ∙ Lampley, E. ∙ Wooten, D. ... Lessons learned From the first 10 consecutive cases of intravenous bacteriophage therapy to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections at a Single Center in the United States Open Forum Infect. Dis. 2020; 7 :ofaa389 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), there are few reports of its use to date since a 2019 case study described treatment of a disseminated M. abscessus subspecies massiliense infection post-lung transplantation ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021b 14. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Freeman, K.G. ∙ Nguyen, J.A. ... Potent antibody-mediated neutralization limits bacteriophage treatment of a pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus infection Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1357-1361 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Persons with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) represent the most vulnerable population for NTM lung disease ( Nick et al., 2021 40. Nick, J.A. ∙ Daley, C.L. ∙ Lenhart-Pendergrass, P.M. ... Nontuberculous mycobacteria in cystic fibrosis Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 2021; 27 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). M. abscessus infections have been associated with a greater decline in lung function compared with typical cystic fibrosis (CF) airway pathogens ( Qvist et al., 2015b 44. Qvist, T. ∙ Gilljam, M. ∙ Jönsson, B. ... Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacteria among patients with cystic fibrosis in Scandinavia J. Cyst. Fibros. 2015; 14 :46-52 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) and when refractory to treatment imposes a contraindication to lung transplant ( Orens et al., 2006 42. Orens, J.B. ∙ Estenne, M. ∙ Arcasoy, S. ... International guidelines for the selection of lung transplant candidates: 2006 update—a consensus report from the Pulmonary Scientific Council of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation J.

Heart Lung Transplant. 2015; 34 :1-15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1048) PubMed Google Scholar ). In advanced CF lung disease, antibiotic treatment of M. abscessus infection may be unsuccessful due to structural changes to the lung, in particular cavities and regions of dense consolidation and parenchymal collapse, which limit therapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. M. abscessus is also known to form biofilms within the CF airway ( Qvist et al., 2015a 43. Qvist, T. ∙ Eickhardt, S. ∙ Kragh, K.N. ... Chronic pulmonary disease with Mycobacterium abscessus complex is a biofilm infection Eur. Respir. J. 2015; 46 :1823-1826 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). In microenvironments within the damaged lung, mycobacteria may survive for extended periods without oxygen or nutrients by shifting into a non-replicating “persister” state that may further thwart conventional antimicrobials and host defense ( Yam et al., 2020 62. Yam, Y.K. ∙ Alvarez, N. ∙ Go, M.L. ... Extreme drug tolerance of Mycobacterium abscessus "persisters" Front. Microbiol. 2020; 11 :359 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Phage treatment of M. abscessus in the CF airway poses both similar and unique challenges, compared with antibiotic therapy. M. abscessus clinical isolates vary greatly in their phage susceptibilities, and therefore therapeutic phages need to be personalized for each patient ( Dedrick et al., 2021a 13. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Aull, H.G. ∙ Jacobs-Sera, D. ... The prophage and plasmid Mobilome as a likely driver of Mycobacterium abscessus diversity mBio. 2021; 12 e03441–e03420 Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar , 2021c 17. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Smith, B.E. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Mycobacterium abscessus Strain morphotype determines phage susceptibility, the repertoire of therapeutically useful phages, and phage resistance mBio. 2021; 12 e03431–e03420 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ). Moreover, most phages that infect M. abscessus are temperate, with the capacity to integrate into bacterial genomes, and must be engineered to have lytic but not lysogenic behavior ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ). Co-infection by closely related lineages of M. abscessus , as well as other species of NTM, raises the potential for selection of a more phage-resistant isolate ( Aslam et al., 2020 1. Aslam, S. ∙ Lampley, E. ∙ Wooten, D. ... Lessons learned From the first 10 consecutive cases of intravenous bacteriophage therapy to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections at a Single Center in the United States Open Forum Infect. Dis. 2020; 7 :ofaa389 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Senhaji-Kacha et al., 2020 53. Senhaji-Kacha, A. ∙ Esteban, J. ∙ Garcia-Quintanilla, M. Considerations for phage therapy against Mycobacterium abscessus Front. Microbiol. 2020; 11 :609017 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), although phage resistance occurs relatively infrequently in M. abscessus ( Dedrick et al., 2021c 17. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Smith, B.E. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Mycobacterium abscessus Strain morphotype determines phage susceptibility, the repertoire of therapeutically useful phages, and phage resistance mBio. 2021; 12 e03431–e03420 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ). Development of neutralizing antibodies against the phage can also potently negate the therapy ( Dedrick et al., 2021b 14. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Freeman, K.G. ∙ Nguyen, J.A. ... Potent antibody-mediated neutralization limits bacteriophage treatment of a pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus infection Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1357-1361 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roach et al., 2017 48. Roach, D.R. ∙ Leung, C.Y. ∙ Henry, M. ... Synergy between the host immune system and bacteriophage is essential for successful phage therapy against an acute respiratory pathogen Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 22 :38-47.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a broader disease context, if substantial killing of M. abscessus was achieved, the resulting niche could become occupied by other opportunistic pathogens.
Pre-existing bacterial co-infections—most commonly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus )—reduce the sensitivity of airway cultures to detect M. abscessus and may obscure markers of clinical response to successful treatment ( Whittier et al., 1997 59. Whittier, S. ∙ Olivier, K. ∙ Gilligan, P. ... Proficiency testing of clinical microbiology laboratories using modified decontamination procedures for detection of nontuberculous mycobacteria in sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients. The nontuberculous Mycobacteria in Cystic Fibrosis Study Group J. Clin. Microbiol. 1997; 35 :2706-2708 PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the relatively low sensitivity of NTM cultures in the CF airway, there is a need for improved culture-independent markers of treatment response to assess efficacy and treatment endpoints. Experiences with phage therapy against P. aeruginosa , S. aureus , and Burkholderia dolosa in CF lung disease have demonstrated examples of improvement, but without clear evidence of eradication of the target infection ( Chan et al., 2021 6. Chan, B.K. ∙ Stanley, G. ∙ Modak, M. ... Bacteriophage therapy for infections in CF Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2021; 56 :S4-S9 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). In some cases, phage therapy resulted in the emergence of phage-resistant and antibiotic-resistant isolates, as well as new pathogens ( Chan et al., 2021 6. Chan, B.K. ∙ Stanley, G. ∙ Modak, M. ... Bacteriophage therapy for infections in CF Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2021; 56 :S4-S9 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Herein we describe the compassionate use of two engineered mycobacteriophages for a young pwCF and M. abscessus subspecies abscessus lung disease, whose infection was refractory against intensive multidrug antibiotic treatment. Extensive collection and biobanking of isolates and clinical samples throughout the duration of his infection pre and post-phage therapy has enabled an in-depth assessment of the effect of phage treatment on M. abscessus infection in the CF lung.

Section: Results

This individual is a 26-year-old man with CF (genotype H199Y/2184insA) with advanced bronchiectasis, M. abscessus lung disease, and chronic lung infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). He had been successfully treated for pulmonary M. avium infection 5 years earlier without evidence of reoccurrence. As an adult his clinical course was notable for frequent pulmonary exacerbations, requiring hospitalization and treatment with intravenous (i.v.) antibiotics.
Sputum cultures first turned positive for M. abscessus subspecies abscessus with an intact erm (41) gene in May 2016 (day −1,582 prior to initiation of phage treatment). Over the next year, recurrent positive cultures and clinical features of increased cough, accelerated lung function decline, increased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, and worsening radiographic findings met the criteria for NTM lung disease ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Daley et al., 2020 8. Daley, C.L. ∙ Iaccarino, J.M. ∙ Lange, C. ... Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA clinical practice guideline Clin. Infect. Dis. 2020; 71 :905-913 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Throughout this infection, the preponderance (69 of 71) of his M. abscessus isolates demonstrated only a rough colony morphology. He was initiated on four-drug therapy on day −1,236 ( Figure 1 D). Over the subsequent 4.7 years, he was maintained on four to five drugs, which were rotated based on drug availability, susceptibility testing, tolerance of side effects, and response to treatment. During his frequent hospitalizations, this NTM therapy was modified to allow for concurrent treatment of P. aeruginosa and MRSA, although at no time was he treated with fewer than four drugs against M. abscessus .
Despite intensive therapy, the participant had persistently positive cultures for M. abscessus subspecies abscessus , worsening radiographic features, and declining lung function, which indicated a lack of microbiologic response ( Figures 1 A and 1B). In the 12 months prior to phage administration, he required 11 hospital admissions ranging from 11 to 21 days in duration ( Figure 1 C). He had been declined for lung transplant by three independent lung transplant programs in part due to a lack of therapeutic options for treatment-refractory M. abscessus lung disease.
An isolate collected −1,555 days prior to phage administration (i.e., “−1,555” sample) was sequenced to provide a complete genome of an early time point isolate. Long and short reads were assembled into one circularized chromosome of 5,018,523 bp. The complete genome contained genes involved in resistance to general antibiotics ( mdtH , stp , sugE ) and specific antibiotics such as beta-lactams ( penP ), isoniazid and ethambutol ( iniA ), bicyclomycin ( bcr ), doxorubicin ( drrA ), fosmidomycin ( fsr ), and tetracycline ( tetA ) ( Seemann, 2014 52. Seemann, T. Prokka: rapid prokaryotic genome annotation Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2068-2069 Crossref Scopus (10440) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is typical of the species. The genome was free of intact prophages and no plasmids were detected.
An M. abscessus isolate grown from sputum collected on day −1,437 was screened for sensitivity to a panel of phages using plaque assays ( Figure 2 A). The M. abscessus pre-phage day −1,437 isolate is sensitive to two host range mutants (HRMs) of an engineered lytic derivative of phage BPs (i.e., BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 and BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM GD03 ) ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 A). This engineering removed part of the repressor gene, rendering them lytic. Phage D29 is a lytic phage grouped in Cluster A and is a presumed naturally occurring derivative of a parent temperate phage ( Dedrick et al., 2017 16. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Mavrich, T.N. ∙ Ng, W.L. ... Expression and evolutionary patterns of mycobacteriophage D29 and its temperate close relatives BMC Microbiol. 2017; 17 :225 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ford et al., 1998 23. Ford, M.E. ∙ Sarkis, G.J. ∙ Belanger, A.E. ... Genome structure of mycobacteriophage D29: implications for phage evolution J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279 :143-164 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ); D29_HRM GD40 is an HRM of D29 isolated on an M. abscessus strain GD40, which unlike the D29 parent infects several M. abscessus clinical isolates ( Dedrick et al., 2021c 17. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Smith, B.E. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Mycobacterium abscessus Strain morphotype determines phage susceptibility, the repertoire of therapeutically useful phages, and phage resistance mBio. 2021; 12 e03431–e03420 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ). M. abscessus pre-phage day −1,437 isolate was efficiently killed by incubation with BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 and D29_HRM GD40 alone or in combination, over a wide range of bacterial and phage concentrations ( Figure 2 B). Upon challenge of 10 8 colony-forming units (CFUs) of pre-phage day −1,437 isolate with either phage separately or both together at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, between 2 and 6 surviving colonies were recovered ( Figure 2 B), but all were found to be fully sensitive to both phages upon retesting ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Phages BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 and D29_HRM GD40 were thus chosen as a therapeutic phage cocktail, amplified and purified to high titer as described previously ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ), and shown to be sterile and endotoxin-free.
Phage dosing was initiated in September 2020 when the individual was near baseline clinical status during hospitalization for a pulmonary exacerbation. Approximately 10 9 plaque-forming units (PFUs/mL) of BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 and 10 8 PFU of D29_HRM GD40 were administered i.v. twice daily through the time of this writing (March 2022), and have been tolerated well, with no adverse events attributed to the therapy. He was discharged from the hospital on day 5 post initiation of phage therapy. He was readmitted on four occasions in the year following initiation of phage for signs and symptoms consistent with a typical pulmonary exacerbation, which on one occasion was complicated by sepsis due to MRSA infection of his implanted venous access port. NTM sputum cultures (n = 17) were obtained between days 5 and 362 post initiation of phage therapy. NTM cultures for M. abscessus subspecies abscessus remained largely positive (6 of 7) through day 96. However, 9 of the 10 most recent cultures (days 116–362) were negative, with a single isolate recovered on day 245 ( Figure 1 A). By contrast, over the same interval, only 1 of 13 (7.7%) airway cultures was negative for either P. aeruginosa or MRSA ( Figure 1 F). From the start of antibiotic treatment (day −1,236) to the initiation of phage, 77.9% (53 of 68) of sputum cultures were positive for M. abscessus , compared with 41.1% (7 of 17) in the year following phage initiation (p = 0.006 by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test), and 10% (1 of 10) in the most recent 280 days of phage and antibiotic treatment, compared with start of antibiotics in addition to phage (p = 0.0001). On day 89, the patient was also initiated on the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulator elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (E/T/I) ( Heijerman et al., 2019 27. Heijerman, H.G.M. ∙ McKone, E.F. ∙ Downey, D.G. ... Efficacy and safety of the elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor combination regimen in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation: a double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial Lancet. 2019; 394 :1940-1948 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (840) PubMed Google Scholar ), following FDA approval of the drug for the H199Y CFTR gene mutation ( NIH and US National Library of Medicine, 2021 41. NIH, US National Library of Medicine LABEL: TRIKAFTA- elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor kit 2021 https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f354423a-85c2-41c3-a9db-0f3aee135d8d Google Scholar ). Over the year post-phage initiation, his FEV 1 ranged between 23 and 31 (% predicted), which was not different from prior to phage treatment. However, his hospital-free time increased ( Figure 1 C). Based on evidence that the M. abscessus infection was controlled, he was listed for lung transplant a year after the initiation of phage therapy and was successfully transplanted on day 379.
At transplant the participant’s lungs were surveyed for evidence of M. abscessus . Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), swabs of unprocessed endobronchial secretions, gross pathology and homogenized tissue from each lobe, and the mainstem bronchovascular margins were stained for acid fact bacilli (AFB), cultured for NTM and bacteria, and analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) ( Rocchetti et al., 2017 49. Rocchetti, T.T. ∙ Silbert, S. ∙ Gostnell, A. ... Detection of Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium abscessus Group, and Mycobacterium fortuitum complex by a multiplex real-time PCR directly from clinical samples using the BD MAX system J. Mol. Diagn. 2017; 19 :295-302 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 G). All sample types were negative for AFB by stain in all lobes. Cultures were positive for P. aeruginosa from all lobes and the left mainstem bronchi (LMB), and M. avium grew from two lobes. M. abscessus DNA was detected in BAL from three lobes and in endobronchial secretions from one lobe by qPCR, but M. abscessus did not grow from any of the matched samples ( Figure 1 G). Gross pathology of the explanted lungs did not demonstrate granulomas, and AFB was not observed in any section ( Figure S1 ). An additional five airway cultures sampled via BAL of the transplanted lungs through day 500 of phage treatment (121 days post transplant) have been negative for M. abscessus , with no clinical evidence of disseminated infection. The participant has experienced an uncomplicated recovery from transplant, with normalization of lung function ( Figure 1 B), and has remained on phage and antibiotic treatment.
Serial high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated severe diffuse varicose upper-lobe cystic bronchiectasis with a left apical cavity. Multifocal mucoid impaction, widespread mosaic attenuation, and scattered poorly defined nodules were present. Focal tree-in-bud pattern was most marked in the right lower lobe (RLL). Selected radiographic features associated with NTM infection were compared between a pre-treatment scan and scans from post-phage therapy days 81 and 229 ( Figure 3 ). At day 81, clear examples of decreased size of consolidative nodules associated with phage treatment were observed; however, this improvement was not uniform, and areas of worsening consolidation and mucous plugging were present as well. By post-phage day 229, additional areas of improvement were apparent.
Molecular quantification of M. abscessus DNA from total DNA of 17 sputum samples, ranging from −136 days pre-phage to 361 days post-phage, was analyzed by real-time qPCR ( Rocchetti et al., 2017 49. Rocchetti, T.T. ∙ Silbert, S. ∙ Gostnell, A. ... Detection of Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium abscessus Group, and Mycobacterium fortuitum complex by a multiplex real-time PCR directly from clinical samples using the BD MAX system J. Mol. Diagn. 2017; 19 :295-302 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a complement to traditional cultures ( Figure 4 A). Compared with a standard curve with known concentrations of M. abscessus , sputum samples from days −136 to 82 demonstrated consistent detection of M. abscessus DNA corresponding with positive cultures during that time period ( Figures 4 B and S2 ). Sputum samples from day −136 to day 3 had M. abscessus DNA concentrations approaching the level of detection (LOD), and an increase in M. abscessus DNA was observed at days 47 and 82 just prior to culture conversion. Nine sputum samples collected between days 130 and 361 did not show detectable levels of M. abscessus DNA (below the LOD) consistent with primarily negative cultures in that time frame. The participant was unable to produce sputum following lung transplant.
NTM cell wall lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a lipoglycan found in all mycobacterial species, is a sensitive marker of NTM airway infection when analyzed by GC/MS in the urine of pwCF ( De et al., 2020 12. De, P. ∙ Amin, A.G. ∙ Graham, B. ... Urine lipoarabinomannan as a marker for low-risk of NTM infection in the CF airway J. Cyst. Fibros. 2020; 19 :801-807 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Urine LAM components D-arabinose (D-Ara) and tuberculostearic acid (TBSA) were measured in samples ranging from −1,132 days pre-phage initiation to 500 days post-phage initiation ( Figures 4 C, S2 , and S3 ). Detection of the LAM components increased in the urine following phage administration and peaked at day 47, consistent with an increase in M. abscessus cell wall lysis greater than when on antibiotic treatment alone. By day 82, urine LAM levels were below pre-phage initiation values, and by day 152 were largely undetectable, consistent with an overall reduction in NTM burden as also indicated by sputum culture results ( Figure 4 A).
NTM infection status can be analyzed by measuring anti- M. avium complex ( Ravnholt et al., 2019 46. Ravnholt, C. ∙ Qvist, T. ∙ Kolpen, M. ... Antibody response against Mycobacterium avium complex in cystic fibrosis patients measured by a novel IgG ELISA test J. Cyst. Fibros. 2019; 18 :516-521 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) and anti- M. abscessus antibodies in plasma ( Ferroni et al., 2005 21. Ferroni, A. ∙ Sermet-Gaudelus, I. ∙ Le Bourgeois, M. ... Measurement of immunoglobulin G against Mycobacterial antigen A60 in patients with cystic fibrosis and lung infection due to Mycobacterium abscessus Clin. Infect. Dis. 2005; 40 :58-66 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) using antigens common to all mycobacteria. Anti-mycobacterial immunoglobulins bind avidly to LAM and other components of the mycobacterial cell wall, and a decline in IgA has been seen with treatment of NTM ( Jhun et al., 2017 31. Jhun, B.W. ∙ Kim, S.Y. ∙ Park, H.Y. ... Changes in serum IgA antibody levels against the glycopeptidolipid core antigen during antibiotic treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease Jpn. J. Infect. Dis. 2017; 70 :582-585 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Anti- M. abscessus IgA and IgG antibodies were measured in the serum ( Figure 4 D) in samples ranging from pre-phage day −1,795 to post-phage day 500. Compared with pre-phage titers, mean IgA titers declined and mean IgG titers trended lower over the course of phage therapy, consistent with a decreased burden of infection. A further incremental decline in both IgG and IgA was apparent post-lung transplant when compared with the year prior on phage treatment.
Serum and sputum samples were examined for the presence of phage DNA by conventional PCR, and all samples were negative. The lack of a serum signal is consistent with prior reports of rapid clearance of phages in the bloodstream ( Schooley et al., 2017 51. Schooley, R.T. ∙ Biswas, B. ∙ Gill, J.J. ... Development and use of personalized bacteriophage-based therapeutic cocktails to treat a patient with a disseminated resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2017; 61 e00954–e00917 Crossref Scopus (778) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although 18 sputum samples were tested over a 12-month period, it is plausible that phage particles were present within a narrow time frame that was not captured by sputum sampling, or that phage DNA was present below the detection limit. Phage DNA was also not detected by PCR in explanted lung samples.
A total of 40 isolates collected on 36 occasions, ranging from pre-phage day −1,555 to post-phage day 245, were subjected to whole-genome sequencing for analysis of genetic changes and response to phage treatment ( Figure 5 A). M. abscessus isolates recovered prior to antibiotic treatment revealed multiple sublineages that evolved from a common ancestor within the dominant circulating clone 1 of M. abscessus subspecies abscessus seen worldwide in CF and non-CF populations ( Bryant et al., 2016 3. Bryant, J.M. ∙ Grogono, D.M. ∙ Rodriguez-Rincon, D. ...

Population genomics of Mycobacterium abscessus from United States cystic fibrosis care centers Ann. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2021; 18 :1960-1969 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). The estimated time of initial infection, based on divergence dating analysis, was November 2013 (pre-phage day −2,494; 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval: pre-phage day −3,435, pre-phage day −1,945), approximately 30 months prior to the first detection by culture ( Figures 1 E, 5 A, and S5 ). With initiation of antibiotic therapy directed against M. abscessus (pre-phage day −1,236), a discernable shift in the population occurred with the emergence of new sublineages A, B, and C ( Figure 5 A). Notable mutations appeared in genes coding for potential virulence factors such as MntH ( Champion et al., 2011 5. Champion, O.L. ∙ Karlyshev, A. ∙ Cooper, I.A.M. ... Yersinia pseudotuberculosis mntH functions in intracellular manganese accumulation, which is essential for virulence and survival in cells expressing functional Nramp1 Microbiology (Reading). 2011; 157 :1115-1122 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) and transcriptional regulators, FeoA and RnE ( Lau et al., 2016 35. Lau, C.K. ∙ Krewulak, K.D. ∙ Vogel, H.J. Bacterial ferrous iron transport: the Feo system FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2016; 40 :273-298 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ; Taverniti et al., 2011 56. Taverniti, V. ∙ Forti, F. ∙ Ghisotti, D. ... Mycobacterium smegmatis RNase J is a 5′-3′ exo-/endoribonuclease and both RNase J and RNase E are involved in ribosomal RNA maturation Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 82 :1260-1276 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). With initiation of phage therapy, the M. abscessus population became genetically less diverse, and isolates of only sublineage C ( Figure 5 A) were recovered prior to sputum culture conversion to negative, with the exception of one isolate recovered at post-phage day 245 from sublineage B that had not been observed since pre-phage day −60 ( Figure 5 A). Together, the isolate population demonstrated a mean substitution rate of 2.7 × 10 −7 mutations per site/year in the core genome ( Figure S5 ), which is comparable to previous estimates for M. abscessus subspecies abscessus ( Bryant et al., 2016 3. Bryant, J.M. ∙ Grogono, D.M. ∙ Rodriguez-Rincon, D. ... Emergence and spread of a human-transmissible multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacterium Science. 2016; 354 :751-757 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ). The greatest genetic distance between any two isolates was only 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core genome.
Genomic variation over time was also assessed with gene content comparisons of sequential M. abscessus isolates ( Figures 5 B and S6 ). For each pair of sequential isolates, pan-genome analysis was performed to identify genes unique to only one sample in the pair (i.e., accessory genes; Figure 5 B, y axis). The range of accessory genes among all sequential isolate pairs was 0%–1.4%, with no evidence of plasmid acquisition or incorporation of viral DNA within the bacterial genomes. A reduction in accessory gene content was observed approximately 1 year after initiation of antibiotic treatment, and isolate pairs following phage initiation were significantly less diverse than those recovered prior to phage therapy (p = 0.0055 by Wilcoxon two-sample test). The decrease in accessory genes over time suggests a reduction in genomic diversity and selection for a homogeneous population as a result of both antibiotic and phage treatments.
All M. abscessus isolates recovered over the course of infection (n = 71) were tested against a 20-drug panel of antibiotics used in the treatment of NTM infection ( Table S1 ). Most antibiotics tested were consistently resistant or demonstrated little variability in activity over the course of infection and treatment. Representative antibiotics of their class with available Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive guidelines ( Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2018 7. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Susceptibility Testing of Mycobacteria, Nocardia spp., and Other Aerobic Actinomycetes 2018 (CLSI) Google Scholar ) for M. abscessus were amikacin, clarithromycin, cefoxitin, doxycycline, imipenem, linezolid, moxifloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). The number of resistant classes of these antibiotics increased in isolates throughout the course of the infection, with considerable variability between isolates ( Figure 5 C). Following the addition of phage to the antibiotic treatment, the resistance of post-phage isolates did not increase further, suggesting the combination of phage and antibiotics did not result in greater antibiotic resistance.
Emergence of phage resistance is a potential limiting factor that may reduce the efficacy of any phage administration. M. abscessus isolates from sputum recovered post-phage days 5, 44, and 245, as well as those collected pre-phage days −323 and −60, were tested for phage susceptibility ( Figure 2 A). All isolates were susceptible to both BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 and D29_HRM GD40 and had the same phage infection profiles as did the initial strain ( Figure 2 D). Thus, emergence of phage resistance was not observed, even in the isolate recovered more than 8 months following initiation of treatment.
Phage treatment can also fail due to anti-phage neutralizing antibodies formed rapidly by the host in response to i.v. phage therapy ( Dedrick et al., 2021b 14. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Freeman, K.G. ∙ Nguyen, J.A. ... Potent antibody-mediated neutralization limits bacteriophage treatment of a pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus infection Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1357-1361 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Serum collected pre-phage day −1 and post-phage days 44, 149, and 269 were tested for IgG binding to both phages used ( Figure 6 A). Surprisingly, this individual had a substantial IgG response to both phages even before phage treatment, which increased modestly in post-treatment serum, as seen in the half-maximal titers ( Figure 6 A). Serum tested at post-treatment days 3 through 500 showed a gradual increase in serum-mediated neutralization of BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 infection, with substantial inactivation 242 days post treatment and beyond ( Figure 6 B). However, only mild neutralization of D29_HRM GD40 was observed ( Figure 6 B). These observations suggest that this individual had naturally encountered phages that induced immunological cross-reactivity to the two phages administered here, but this cross-reactivity was not sufficiently closely related to BPs or D29 to have initiated neutralizing activity. Furthermore, he did not mount a substantial additional antibody response to BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 until relatively late in treatment, at which point sputum cultures had become predominantly negative. These antibodies do not appear to cross-react to neutralize D29_HRM GD40 , which presumably remained active throughout the treatment course.

Section: Discussion

In the setting of severe infections that may possess resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, treatment with phages is increasingly considered. Chronic pulmonary infection with M. abscessus is a particularly appealing therapeutic target, as current guidelines recommend combinations of three or more drugs for at least 12 months of therapy beyond initial culture conversion to negative ( Daley et al., 2020 8. Daley, C.L. ∙ Iaccarino, J.M. ∙ Lange, C. ... Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA clinical practice guideline Clin. Infect. Dis. 2020; 71 :905-913 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). This antibiotic treatment is often unsuccessful when measured against the eradication of infection ( Daley et al., 2020 8. Daley, C.L. ∙ Iaccarino, J.M. ∙ Lange, C. ... Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA clinical practice guideline Clin. Infect. Dis. 2020; 71 :905-913 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martiniano et al., 2014 38. Martiniano, S.L. ∙ Sontag, M.K. ∙ Daley, C.L. ... Clinical significance of a first positive nontuberculous mycobacteria culture in cystic fibrosis Ann. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2014; 11 :36-44 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), likely due to the capacity of M. abscessus to form biofilms or to survive within host cells, combined with physical sequestration in mucous plugs or cavities, which together may effectively shield the pathogen from therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics. Treatment is even more challenging in the context of CF lung disease, as co-infection with other bacterial pathogens reduces the sensitivity of airway cultures to monitor response to therapy. Given the capacity of M. abscessus to disseminate to skin, soft tissue, and bone, following immunosuppression, uncontrolled infection is cited as a contraindication to transplant ( Orens et al., 2006 42. Orens, J.B. ∙ Estenne, M. ∙ Arcasoy, S. ...

Currently, there are no reports of successful phage treatment of M. abscessus infection of the lung. In 2019, beneficial use of mycobacteriophages was reported for the treatment of a 15-year-old girl with CF who developed disseminated M. abscessus subspecies massiliense infection following lung transplantation ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this case, the phage cocktail consisted of three mycobacteriophages, including BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 that was also used in the current case and is a genetically modified derivative of a temperate phage that kills its host more efficiently. The phage regimen resulted in reduction in size of skin nodules, improvement of the sternal wound infection, reduction in abdominal lymph nodes evaluated by PET-CT (positron emission tomography–computed tomography) scan, and general clinical improvement. No resistance to phages was observed, and no neutralizing immune reactions occurred, possibly due to the use of immunosuppressive drugs to support the newly transplanted lungs ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a recent report of treatment of pulmonary infection due to M. abscessus subspecies massiliense in the context of non-CF bronchiectasis, phage treatment failed due to robust IgM- and IgG-mediated neutralizing antibody responses ( Dedrick et al., 2021b 14. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Freeman, K.G. ∙ Nguyen, J.A. ... Potent antibody-mediated neutralization limits bacteriophage treatment of a pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus infection Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1357-1361 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). In some cases, prospective patients have died before receiving treatment ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In the current case, there is strong evidence that biologically significant lysis of M. abscessus occurred in response to mycobacteriophage administration. Currently the “gold standard” for determining response to treatment of M. abscessus lung disease is conversion of sputum cultures from positive to negative. However, in the context of CF, the sensitivity of NTM sputum cultures is particularly low, given the requirement for bacterial decontamination of P. aeruginosa and other co-pathogens, which markedly reduces the viability of M. abscessus as well ( Whittier et al., 1997 59. Whittier, S. ∙ Olivier, K. ∙ Gilligan, P. ... Proficiency testing of clinical microbiology laboratories using modified decontamination procedures for detection of nontuberculous mycobacteria in sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients. The nontuberculous Mycobacteria in Cystic Fibrosis Study Group J. Clin. Microbiol. 1997; 35 :2706-2708 PubMed Google Scholar ). In this individual, the sensitivity of individual sputum culture from the time of first positive M. abscessus to the initiation of phage treatment was only 70.3% (64 positive out of 91). However, at no time over 4.2 years of infection prior to phage initiation were there more than two consecutive negative cultures ( Figure 1 ). Given the severe cavitary nature of his lung disease, it cannot be known if M. abscessus had been completely eradicated through testing of airway samples. However, in combination with antibiotics, the burden of infection was decreased below limits of detection by both sputum culture and the culture-independent assays employed. The CF Foundation and the European CF Society recommend that individuals with CF receiving NTM treatment with sequential negative cultures may be eligible for transplant listing ( Floto et al., 2016 22. Floto, R.A. ∙ Olivier, K.N. ∙ Saiman, L. ... US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus recommendations for the management of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in individuals with cystic fibrosis Thorax. 2016; 71 :i1-i22 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, with evident response to treatment the participant was offered a lung transplant after having previously been declined. Analysis of the explanted lung tissue supports the conclusion that viable M. abscessus was sterilized from the lung, as AFB stains and cultures were negative even in samples where species-specific qPCR detected M. abscessus DNA from the same sample. Continued negative airway cultures through the first 4 months post transplant augment this claim.
At no point during therapy was there evidence of genetic adaptation of M. abscessus to the phage. Longitudinal genetic analysis of 40 M. abscessus isolates over nearly 5 years was consistent with previous M. abscessus studies suggesting a primarily clonal infection ( Bryant et al., 2016 3. Bryant, J.M. ∙ Grogono, D.M. ∙ Rodriguez-Rincon, D. ... Emergence and spread of a human-transmissible multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacterium Science. 2016; 354 :751-757 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ; Davidson et al., 2014 11. Davidson, R.M. ∙ Hasan, N.A. ∙ Reynolds, P.R. ... Genome sequencing of Mycobacterium abscessus isolates from patients in the United States and comparisons to globally diverse clinical strains J.

Population genomics of Mycobacterium abscessus from United States cystic fibrosis care centers Ann. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2021; 18 :1960-1969 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the emergence of adapted sublineages over time ( Bryant et al., 2021 2. Bryant, J.M. ∙ Brown, K.P. ∙ Burbaud, S. ... Stepwise pathogenic evolution of Mycobacterium abscessus Science. 2021; 372 :eabb8699 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kreutzfeldt et al., 2013 32. Kreutzfeldt, K.M. ∙ McAdam, P.R. ∙ Claxton, P. ... Molecular longitudinal tracking of Mycobacterium abscessus spp. during chronic infection of the human lung PLoS One. 2013; 8 :e63237 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the limited genetic changes in the core genome among isolates, there were examples of nonsynonymous mutations observed in the same genes across multiple sublineages. For example, a gene encoding an FeoA transcriptional repressor protein acquired independent mutations in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of sublineages A and C and a branch of sublineage B during the course of antibiotic treatment ( Figure 5 A). Similar examples of within-host parallel evolution of transcriptional regulators have been observed during chronic M. abscessus infections in the CF airway, which likely reflect adaptations to the lung environment ( Bryant et al., 2021 2. Bryant, J.M. ∙ Brown, K.P. ∙ Burbaud, S. ... Stepwise pathogenic evolution of Mycobacterium abscessus Science. 2021; 372 :eabb8699 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pan-genome analysis revealed a substantial reduction in accessory genes after antibiotic and phage treatment, consistent with selection for a persistent and homogeneous population ( Figures 5 B and S6 ). Only isolates from sublineage C were observed after the initiation of phage therapy, suggesting that the phage cocktail may have been more efficient at killing subpopulations A and B over C ( Figure 5 A). However, one isolate of sublineage B was recovered after nearly 5 months of negative cultures, but did not show increased antibiotic or phage resistance, suggesting that it may have evaded phage treatment through sequestration in a lung cavity or airway biofilm.
In cases of bacteriophage treatment of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii , the development of phage resistance has been reported, as well as the emergence of new bacterial isolates with different antibiotic susceptibility profiles from the original infecting strain ( Aslam et al., 2020 1. Aslam, S. ∙ Lampley, E. ∙ Wooten, D. ... Lessons learned From the first 10 consecutive cases of intravenous bacteriophage therapy to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections at a Single Center in the United States Open Forum Infect. Dis. 2020; 7 :ofaa389 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schooley et al., 2017 51. Schooley, R.T. ∙ Biswas, B. ∙ Gill, J.J. ... Development and use of personalized bacteriophage-based therapeutic cocktails to treat a patient with a disseminated resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2017; 61 e00954–e00917 Crossref Scopus (778) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is proposed that the use of more than one phage simultaneously as well as the combined treatment with antibiotics are useful strategies to prevent this occurrence ( Aslam et al., 2020 1. Aslam, S. ∙ Lampley, E. ∙ Wooten, D. ... Lessons learned From the first 10 consecutive cases of intravenous bacteriophage therapy to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections at a Single Center in the United States Open Forum Infect. Dis. 2020; 7 :ofaa389 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). The relationship between the use of phage therapy and conventional antibiotics is complex and not completely understood. Under various conditions, in vitro studies of combined use of phage and antibiotics have identified additive, synergistic, antagonistic, or no effects ( Gu Liu et al., 2020 24. Gu Liu, C. ∙ Green, S.I. ∙ Min, L. ... Phage-antibiotic synergy is driven by a unique combination of antibacterial mechanism of action and stoichiometry mBio. 2020; 11 e01462–e01420 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Enhanced susceptibility to antibiotics by phage may occur via modification of cell wall permeability and anti-biofilm mechanisms ( Chakraborty and Kumar, 2019 4. Chakraborty, P. ∙ Kumar, A. The extracellular matrix of mycobacterial biofilms: could we shorten the treatment of mycobacterial infections? Microb. Cell. 2019; 6 :105-122 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2016 37. Li, Q. ∙ Zhou, M. ∙ Fan, X. ... Mycobacteriophage SWU1 gp39 can potentiate multiple antibiotics against Mycobacterium via altering the cell wall permeability Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :28701 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Senhaji-Kacha et al., 2020 53. Senhaji-Kacha, A. ∙ Esteban, J. ∙ Garcia-Quintanilla, M. Considerations for phage therapy against Mycobacterium abscessus Front. Microbiol. 2020; 11 :609017 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the current case, the final isolates recovered did not demonstrate increased antibiotic resistance, supporting the conclusion that phage treatment did not promote antibiotic resistance, and that the persister isolate recovered on day 245 likely originated from a cavity or occluded airway where antibiotic and phage therapy failed to penetrate.
Given the extremely long duration of antibiotic and phage treatment associated with treatment of M. abscessus , the emergence of anti-phage neutralizing antibodies is of potential concern. In previous reports, the lack of antibody development was associated with successful treatment in the setting of post-transplant immunosuppression in one case ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the rapid development of antibodies correlated with treatment failure in another ( Dedrick et al., 2021b 14. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Freeman, K.G. ∙ Nguyen, J.A. ... Potent antibody-mediated neutralization limits bacteriophage treatment of a pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus infection Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1357-1361 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the current case, sputum cultures converted to negative prior to development of significant neutralizing antibodies to one of the phages. Based on in vitro assays, D29_HRM GD40 remained active throughout, even though BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 was substantially compromised by neutralization by day 149 ( Figure 6 ). Thus, even though a two-phage cocktail was chosen to minimize any potential phage resistance, it also presented the possibility that even if neutralization to one phage was observed, the other phage may be less immunogenic. We note that by day +245, when D29_HRM GD40 was effectively the sole active phage, no resistance to that phage was observed ( Figure 2 ), consistent with other reports of infrequent phage resistance in M. abscessus ( Dedrick et al., 2021c 17. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Smith, B.E. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Mycobacterium abscessus Strain morphotype determines phage susceptibility, the repertoire of therapeutically useful phages, and phage resistance mBio. 2021; 12 e03431–e03420 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ), a potentially substantial advantage for the therapeutic use of mycobacteriophages.
Together our results derived from objective orthogonal markers provide a road map for successful phage treatment in the context of advanced CF lung disease. Understanding the time span associated with initial response, radiologic improvement and culture conversion following the start of treatment are essential for future therapeutic applications and clinical trial designs, as is the use of complementary culture-independent markers of M. abscessus lysis, which can overcome the poor sensitivity of sputum culture and the inability to measure disease in areas of dense consolidation or parenchymal cavities. The biology of M. abscessus in the airway may serve to avoid some of the pitfalls encountered in the treatment of other pathogens common to the CF airway. In particular, most cases of M. abscessus infection are characterized by closely related lineages with relatively high genetic stability from a single common ancestor ( Davidson et al., 2021b 10. Davidson, R.M. ∙ Hasan, N.A. ∙ Epperson, L.E. ... Population genomics of Mycobacterium abscessus from United States cystic fibrosis care centers Ann. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2021; 18 :1960-1969 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). This may limit the emergence of phage-resistant isolates that have occurred in phage therapy of P. aeruginosa , where extensive genetic diversity and plasticity frequently exist due to selection for hypermutator genotypes and reinfection with new environmental clones during the course of infection ( Rossi et al., 2021 50. Rossi, E. ∙ La Rosa, R. ∙ Bartell, J.A. ... Pseudomonas aeruginosa adaptation and evolution in patients with cystic fibrosis Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2021; 19 :331-342 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is likely that improvement in lung function would require administration of phage with antibiotics earlier in the course of infection, with the risk that anti-phage neutralizing antibodies may develop and limit the option for later treatment. However, the use of phages in very advanced lung disease with the objective to sufficiently control M. abscessus as a bridge to lung transplant may be considered based on this report.
Limitations in interpreting the efficacy of phage therapy in this subject are typical of the complexity of cases of this nature. As we are aware of no previous reports of successful treatment of pulmonary M. abscessus infection with phage, it is impossible to know whether the findings of this single case are representative of others who may receive this treatment. In addition, there may be unrecognized factors that modified the response in various ways. Phages were administered in addition to guideline-based treatment of CF lung disease ( Mogayzel et al., 2013 39. Mogayzel, P.J. ∙ Naureckas, E.T. ∙ Robinson, K.A. ..., Pulmonary Clinical Practice Guidelines Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines. Chronic medications for maintenance of lung health Am. J. Respir.

Use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis Ann. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2018; 15 :271-280 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as intensive antibiotic therapy for M. abscessus , MDR P. aeruginosa , and MRSA. While prior to phage therapy the choice of antibiotic therapy was varied, the combination of drugs used in conjunction with the phage was relatively constant. On day 89 of phage therapy, the CFTR modulator E/T/I was introduced as on-label treatment, as a result of approval for use with the H199Y CFTR gene mutation through a label expansion by the FDA ( NIH and US National Library of Medicine, 2021 41. NIH, US National Library of Medicine LABEL: TRIKAFTA- elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor kit 2021 https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f354423a-85c2-41c3-a9db-0f3aee135d8d Google Scholar ). This label expansion was not based on results from clinical trials, but rather from in vitro studies confirming a minimum of 10% increase in chloride transport over baseline in FRT cells expressing the H199Y CFTR gene mutation ( NIH and US National Library of Medicine, 2021 41. NIH, US National Library of Medicine LABEL: TRIKAFTA- elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor kit 2021 https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f354423a-85c2-41c3-a9db-0f3aee135d8d Google Scholar ). There are no previous reports of E/T/I use in a pwCF with the H199Y/2184insA CFTR genotype, and the extent of clinical benefit is not known. It is likely that E/T/I allowed for a degree of improved host response in terms of improved airway clearance and nutrition; however, this individual did not demonstrate an improvement in lung function or a reduction in sputum production with E/T/I, and at the time of transplant the degree of inflammation in his airways was severe. There are no known direct antibiotic properties of E/T/I against M. abscessus , and culture-independent markers of NTM lysis indicated a response prior to E/T/I initiation. In some pwCF, initiation of highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) with the first CFTR modulator, ivacaftor, was linked to a decrease in the relative abundance and apparent eradication of P. aeruginosa ( Hisert et al., 2017 29. Hisert, K.B. ∙ Heltshe, S.L. ∙ Pope, C. ... Restoring cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function reduces airway bacteria and inflammation in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic lung infections Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Changes in the cystic fibrosis airway microbiome in response to CFTR modulator therapy Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2021; 11 :548613 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this individual remained infected with P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with M. avium present in the explanted lung tissue, supporting the conclusion that eradication of M. abscessus was a specific response to phage therapy and not due to general improvement following E/T/I. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible that partial restoration of CFTR function by E/T/I may have resulted in beneficial alterations in the airway microenvironment that contributed toward a more successful response to phage therapy.

Isolates of M. abscessus analyzed in this study will be made available on request following completion of a material transfer agreement.
The individual described in this case study is a 26-year-old man with CF (genotype H199Y/2184insA), advanced bronchiectasis, and M. abscessus lung infection. He was diagnosed with CF at birth by newborn screening and developed typical complications, including chronic lung infection with multi-drug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), CF-related diabetes, sinus disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition requiring supplemental feeding via percutaneous gastrostomy tube. Sputum cultures first turned positive for M. abscessus subspecies abscessus in May 2016, and he was initiated on antibiotic therapy in May 2017 with an initial combination of amikacin (nebulized), imipenem, linezolid and clofazimine. Azithromycin was not active in vitro against his M. abscessus but was administered for other indications. He was initiated on a mycobacteriophage cocktail in September, 2020, with continuation of antibiotics. He was transplanted after 379 days of treatment, and was followed for 121 days post-transplant (500 days total of phage treatment). The investigators were granted an expanded access investigational new drug (IND) for compassionate use of this mycobacteriophage cocktail by the FDA (IND 26902). The IND, treatment protocol, and informed consent were approved by the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York, LLC (BRANY) Institutional Review Board (20-07-463-528). The participant was enrolled in the CF Foundation Patient Registry (HS-1683-528), the PREDICT (NCT02073409)(HS-2798) and PATIENCE (NCT02419989)(HS-2833) Trials which allowed for retrospective and prospective data and specimen collection relating to the diagnosis and treatment of his M. abscessus . Collection and banking of NTM isolates was approved by the National Jewish Health Institutional Review Board (HS-3149), as well as sampling of sputum, saliva, breath, blood and urine (BRANY IRB File HS-1234-528). Consent for analysis of explanted lung tissue was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB 11-1664) as well as written and verbal authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Assessments of safety and response were made weekly either at the Adult CF Clinic at National Jewish Health or at home, as well as during hospitalizations. Assessments of radiologic changes, microbiologic changes and laboratory monitoring were performed in the context of clinical care.
A mycobacteriophage cocktail, consisting of engineered phages BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 and D29_HRM GD40 , was identified as lytic towards an M. abscessus isolate recovered early in the course of infection (October, 2016, 1532 days prior to phage initiation). Following informed consent, a dose of 10 9 to 10 8 plaque-forming units (PFU/ml) diluted in PBS was administered by IV twice daily through an existing mediport, and continues to the present.
NTM cultures were tested by the Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory (National Jewish Health, Denver CO, USA), which is a CLIA-certified lab that serves as a national NTM reference laboratory. Specimens were digested/decontaminated using a standard NaOH-NALC procedure, and the sediment used to prepare an auramine smear and inoculate various growth medium including: Lowenstein-Jensen Slant, Middlebrook 7H11 Agar/ Mitchison 7H11 Selective Agar biplate(s) and MGIT (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube) incubated for up to six weeks. Positive AFB culture growth was assessed from solid growth media at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. MGIT specimens were continuously monitored. Upon growth, genomic DNA was isolated for subsequent PCR amplification. A targeted segment of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta ( rpoB ) gene was performed and consensus sequence determined, constructed and blasted against a known database to determine molecular identification. All M. abscessus isolates (n=71) were tested for antibiotic susceptibility against a 20-drug panel via broth microdilution. Representative antibiotics of their class with available Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive guidelines ( Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2018 7. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Susceptibility Testing of Mycobacteria, Nocardia spp., and Other Aerobic Actinomycetes 2018 (CLSI) Google Scholar ) for M. abscessus were amikacin, clarithromycin, cefoxitin, doxycycline, imipenem, linezolid, moxifloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). The number of resistant classes were tabulated for each isolate, based on the published breakpoints in MIC.
At the time of transplantation, the explanted lungs were surgically removed and stored at 3°C in Custodial HTK Solution Transport Medium. Within 48 hours, grossly purulent endobroncial secretions were sampled from large bronchi of all lobes and processed as sputum for culture and culture-independent analysis. Distal airways from each lobe were sampled by lavage with saline and processed as sputum. Tissue from each lobe and the mainstem bronchi were dissected from regions with obvious disease and weighed, minced with scissors to 1-2 mm pieces, and combined with PBS (3°C) and stainless steel beads (0.2gm, 0.9-2.0 mm) followed by homogenization by Bullet Blender (Next Advance, Inc). Tissue from each lobe was also processed for microscopy slides and stained with H&E, AFB and GMS (Grocott's methenamine silver) stains.
Bacterial DNA samples were extracted using an adapted method for mycobacteria cells, including enzymatic lysis steps and column purification with the Zymo Genomic DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) as described ( Epperson and Strong, 2020 20. Epperson, L.E. ∙ Strong, M. A scalable, efficient, and safe method to prepare high quality DNA from mycobacteria and other challenging cells J. Clin. Tuberc. Other Mycobact. Dis. 2020; 19 :100150 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) libraries were prepared with the NexteraXT Library Prep Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), and library sizes were assessed on an Agilent BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Multiplexed library pools were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (2X300bp paired end reads) as described ( Davidson et al., 2021a 9. Davidson, R.M. ∙ Benoit, J.B. ∙ Kammlade, S.M. ...

Rep. 2021; 11 :15336 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pairwise SNP distances between isolates were computed with MEGA-CC 7.0.26 ( Kumar et al., 2016 33. Kumar, S. ∙ Stecher, G. ∙ Tamura, K. MEGA7: molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 7.0 for bigger datasets Mol. Biol. Evol. 2016; 33 :1870-1874 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Estimation of mutation rate and the dates of common ancestors were calculated using Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST v1.10.4; Suchard et al., 2018 55. Suchard, M.A. ∙ Lemey, P. ∙ Baele, G. ... Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic data integration using BEAST 1.10 Virus Evol. 2018; 4 :vey016 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and the following parameters: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with a chain length of 100 million states, general time reversible (GTR) evolutionary model, strict clock, constant population size, and a minimum of 3 iterations. Statistics for clock rate and other parameters were summarized with Tracer v1.7.1 ( Rambaut et al., 2018 45. Rambaut, A. ∙ Drummond, A.J. ∙ Xie, D. ... Posterior summarization in Bayesian phylogenetics using Tracer 1.7 Syst. Biol. 2018; 67 :901-904 Crossref Scopus (6558) PubMed Google Scholar ), and consensus trees were constructed with TreeAnnotator ( Drummond and Rambaut, 2007 19. Drummond, A.J. ∙ Rambaut, A. BEAST: Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7 :214 Crossref Scopus (10726) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phylogenetic trees were visualized with ggtree ( Yu et al., 2016 64.

Urine samples were collected in sterile containers, centrifuged, frozen within one hour at -20 o C, then stored in a -80 o C freezer. Urine was subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) over Octyl Sepharose (OS)-CL 4B. The 40% and 65% n-propanol in 0.1 M NH 4 OAc eluents off the HIC column were processed for GC/MS analysis as previously described ( De et al., 2020 12. De, P. ∙ Amin, A.G. ∙ Graham, B. ... Urine lipoarabinomannan as a marker for low-risk of NTM infection in the CF airway J. Cyst. Fibros. 2020; 19 :801-807 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). GC/MS analyses were carried out using a Thermo GC-TSQ8000 Evo Triple Quad GC mass spectrometer. Chromatograms with respective peaks were integrated manually ( i.e ., peak areas were defined manually and integrated areas were generated by Chromeleon 7.2 software) for the assessment of total D-ara and TBSA content.
Heat-killed M. abscessus (ATCC 19977) was probe-sonicated and 100ng protein dried in 96-well plates. Plates were blocked with BSA and incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:10,000 dilutions of plasma. Wells were washed, and bound antibody detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human antibodies specific for IgG and IGA (Abcam, SouthernBiotech).
A real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was used to detect M. abscessus DNA in sputum and explant samples. Primer and probe sequences targeting the internal transcriber spacer (ITS) ( Rocchetti et al., 2017 49. Rocchetti, T.T. ∙ Silbert, S. ∙ Gostnell, A. ...

Diagn. 2017; 19 :295-302 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ) were ordered from IDT (Coralville, IA). TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Thermofisher) was combined with forward and reverse primers (final concentration 500nM each), probe (final concentration 250nM), and water. A standard curve of M. abscessus DNA in a background of 5ng/μL of human gDNA (Takara Bio) was used for quantification including seven 10-fold dilutions ranging from 1ng/μL to 0.0001pg/μL. DNA was extracted from raw sputum, endobronchial secretions and BAL using enzymatic and mechanical lysis steps, and column purification with the Zymo Genomic DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) as described ( Epperson and Strong, 2020 20. Epperson, L.E. ∙ Strong, M. A scalable, efficient, and safe method to prepare high quality DNA from mycobacteria and other challenging cells J. Clin. Tuberc. Other Mycobact. Dis. 2020; 19 :100150 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total DNA from these samples (100ng) and standard curve samples were analyzed in triplicate with the QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) with the following cycling conditions: 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes, and 45 cycles of 95° for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute.
M. smegmatis mc 2 155 is a laboratory strain and was grown as previously described ( Jacobs-Sera et al., 2012 30. Jacobs-Sera, D. ∙ Marinelli, L.J. ∙ Bowman, C. ..., Science Education Alliance Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics And Evolutionary Science Sea-Phages Program On the nature of mycobacteriophage diversity and host preference Virology. 2012; 434 :187-201 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). M. abscessus pre-phage day -1437 was grown on Middlebrook 7H9 media with OADC and 1 mM CaCl 2 for 4-5 days, shaking, at 37°C. M. abscessus cultures were sonicated briefly before use as previously reported ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Standard plaque assays were used for phage susceptibility testing by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions on both M. smegmatis mc 2 155 and M. abscessus pre-phage day -1437 top agar overlays. Phages used for screening were obtained from the collection at the University of Pittsburgh and were propagated on M. smegmatis mc 2 155. Some of the phages had been previously engineered to remove all or part of their repressor gene to confer obligatorily lytic growth ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat.

Mycobacterium abscessus Strain morphotype determines phage susceptibility, the repertoire of therapeutically useful phages, and phage resistance mBio. 2021; 12 e03431–e03420 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ); this includes BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 as described previously ( Dedrick et al., 2019 15. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aliquots of 10 7 CFU M. abscessus were incubated with or without phage at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 48 hr in liquid media and plated on solid media.
Phages were grown on M. smegmatis mc 2 155 using solid media and recovered by collection of top agar ( Dedrick et al., 2021c 17. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Smith, B.E. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Mycobacterium abscessus Strain morphotype determines phage susceptibility, the repertoire of therapeutically useful phages, and phage resistance mBio. 2021; 12 e03431–e03420 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ). After dialysis, the EndoZyme II (Hyglos GmbH) assay was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions and endotoxin levels were undetectable. Sterility of BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 and D29_HRM GD40 was confirmed by Accugen, Inc. BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 at 1x10 11 PFU ml -1 and D29_HRM GD40 at 1x10 10 PFU ml -1 were combined into a cocktail monthly.
Each serum sample was diluted (1:10) in phage buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgSO 4 , and 68 mM NaCl) and incubated with either BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 or D29_HRM GD40 or a control phage Fionnbharth Δ 45 - 47 for 24 hours at room temperature. Next, 10-fold serial dilutions were made and 3 μl of each dilution were spotted onto top agar overlays of M. smegmatis mc 2 155 and then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Serum samples were not heat inactivated.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were completed as described ( Dedrick et al., 2021b 14. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Freeman, K.G. ∙ Nguyen, J.A. ... Potent antibody-mediated neutralization limits bacteriophage treatment of a pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus infection Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1357-1361 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, EIA microplates were coated with either pure coating buffer (carbonate-bicarbonate, pH = 9.6) or 50 ng of total protein from highly purified phage (BPsΔ 33 HTH_HRM10 or D29_HRM GD40 ), then incubated with at least eight serum dilutions and probed with Goat Anti-Human IgG Fc (HRP) (Abcam ab98624). Sera were not heat inactivated. The plates were developed with TMB substrate and stopped with H 2 SO 4 before quantification of OD 450 (signal) and OD 570 (background). After background subtraction, the OD 450 values were plotted against dilution and fit with a fixed-baseline logistic curve. Half-maximal serum IgG titers were determined from the fit.
Data and statistical analysis for clinical features, markers of host and pathogen response, and antibiotic resistance were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0.2 and JMP 13 (SAS Institute, INC). Replicates and statistical details can also be found in the methods and figure legends. For virus neutralization assays, the serum and plasma samples were diluted and tested in duplicate. For ELISAs, the sera were diluted and tested in triplicate. ELISA data and statistical analyses were performed in OriginLab 2020 version 9.7.0.188.
