Title: Structural snapshots of TRPV1 reveal mechanism of polymodal functionality


Abstract: Summary

Many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels respond to diverse stimuli and conditionally conduct small and large cations. Such functional plasticity is presumably enabled by a uniquely dynamic ion selectivity filter that is regulated by physiological agents. What is currently missing is a “photo series” of intermediate structural states that directly address this hypothesis and reveal specific mechanisms behind such dynamic channel regulation. Here, we exploit cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize conformational transitions of the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, as a model to understand how dynamic transitions of the selectivity filter in response to algogenic agents, including protons, vanilloid agonists, and peptide toxins, permit permeation by small and large organic cations. These structures also reveal mechanisms governing ligand binding substates, as well as allosteric coupling between key sites that are proximal to the selectivity filter and cytoplasmic gate. These insights suggest a general framework for understanding how TRP channels function as polymodal signal integrators.

Section: Introduction

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are polymodal signal integrators that detect and respond to distinct physiologic stimuli. This is perhaps best exemplified by TRPV1 ( Caterina et al., 1997 13. Caterina, M.J. ∙ Schumacher, M.A. ∙ Tominaga, M. ... The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway Nature. 1997; 389 :816-824 Crossref Scopus (7575) PubMed Google Scholar ), a heat-activated channel whose sensitivity to inflammatory agents, including extracellular protons ( Jordt et al., 2000 34. Jordt, S.E. ∙ Tominaga, M. ∙ Julius, D. Acid potentiation of the capsaicin receptor determined by a key extracellular site Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :8134-8139 Crossref Scopus (558) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tominaga et al., 1998 59. Tominaga, M. ∙ Caterina, M.J. ∙ Malmberg, A.B. ...

Biol. 2013; 29 :355-384 Crossref Scopus (873) PubMed Google Scholar ). Functional and structural studies have identified sites on the channel that confer sensitivity to these and other modulatory agents, and that lie in close proximity to restriction points along the ion permeation pathway—one in the “upper” extracellular half of pathway near the selectivity filter, and another within the “lower” half of the pathway, near the cytoplasmic gate ( Cao et al., 2013 12. Cao, E. ∙ Liao, M. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms Nature. 2013; 504 :113-118 Crossref Scopus (828) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Some TRP subtypes, such as TRPV5 and TRPV6, are highly selective for divalent cations and have rigid selectivity filters resembling those of voltage-gated potassium channels ( Dang et al., 2019 18.

Others, such as TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, and TRPA1, which accommodate monovalent, divalent, and large organic cations ( Binshtok et al., 2007 10. Binshtok, A.M. ∙ Bean, B.P. ∙ Woolf, C.J.

Although the physiological consequences of such structural plasticity are not fully understood, for TRPV1 or TRPA1 this may facilitate calcium-dependent release of peptide transmitters from sensory nerve endings to promote neurogenic inflammation and pain hypersensitivity ( Lin King et al., 2019 39. Lin King, J.V. ∙ Emrick, J.J. ∙ Kelly, M.J.S. ... A Cell-Penetrating Scorpion Toxin Enables Mode-Specific Modulation of TRPA1 and Pain Cell. 2019; 178 :1362-1374.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plasticity of the upper restriction may also allow permeation by cationic lidocaine derivatives, which can be exploited to deliver local anesthetics to TRPV1-expressing nociceptors ( Binshtok et al., 2007 10. Binshtok, A.M. ∙ Bean, B.P. ∙ Woolf, C.J. Inhibition of nociceptors by TRPV1-mediated entry of impermeant sodium channel blockers Nature. 2007; 449 :607-610 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether and how the upper restriction accommodates both small and large cations remain unclear.
Aside from effects on ion permeation, conformational changes in the outer pore region influence TRPV1 gating. Indeed, algogenic gating modifiers such as spider toxins and extracellular protons interact with residues in the outer pore region to facilitate opening of the cytoplasmic gate. However, although pharmacological and biophysical studies strongly suggest that the upper and lower restrictions are allosterically coupled ( Bohlen et al., 2010 11. Bohlen, C.J. ∙ Priel, A. ∙ Zhou, S. ... A bivalent tarantula toxin activates the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, by targeting the outer pore domain Cell. 2010; 141 :834-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ), structural mechanisms underlying such communication remain unclear. Also at issue is the relative contribution of evolutionarily conserved structural elements, such as S1–S4 voltage sensor-like domain (VSLD) or S4–S5 linker region, to gating of TRPs when compared with their topologically similar voltage-gated ion channel cousins. What role, if any, do such regions play in the allosteric coupling between upper and lower restrictions, and how do physiological modulators, such as inflammatory agents, natural products, or drugs exploit these interactions to regulate channel activity? Furthermore, many TRP channels are homo-tetrameric, raising questions about the functional equivalency of ligand binding sites and whether drugs or physiological modulators interact in a cooperative, sequential, or random manner to trigger gating.
Among TRP channels, TRPV1 enjoys the richest pharmacology, which we leverage here to capture snapshots of nanodisc-reconstituted channels using single particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). These substates represent key structural intermediates in which the status of small and large permeating cations, stepwise engagement of ligands with TRPV1, and stoichiometry of ligand binding can be directly visualized at key regulatory points. Furthermore, these substates highlight transitions between channel conformations, revealing a two-step mechanism whereby extracellular protons, a key algogenic component of the inflammatory milieu ( Bevan and Geppetti, 1994 9. Bevan, S. ∙ Geppetti, P. Protons: small stimulants of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17 :509-512 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ), alter the structure of the upper restriction to facilitate opening of the lower gate. These findings provide a framework for understanding the uniquely dynamic behavior of this extended family of excitatory ion channels.

Section: Results

Previously, we stabilized the open state of TRPV1 with a combination of agents, including a peptide spider toxin (double-knot toxin [DkTx]) and a vanilloid agonist (resiniferatoxin [RTX]), that target upper and lower restrictions, respectively ( Cao et al., 2013 12. Cao, E. ∙ Liao, M. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms Nature. 2013; 504 :113-118 Crossref Scopus (828) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gao et al., 2016 22. Gao, Y. ∙ Cao, E. ∙ Julius, D. ... TRPV1 structures in nanodiscs reveal mechanisms of ligand and lipid action Nature. 2016; 534 :347-351 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we sought to trap channel states using DkTx alone to focus in on conformational transitions that primarily target the outer pore and upper restriction. DkTx triggers transient single channel events preceding conversion to a stable open state ( Bohlen et al., 2010 11. Bohlen, C.J. ∙ Priel, A. ∙ Zhou, S. ... A bivalent tarantula toxin activates the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, by targeting the outer pore domain Cell. 2010; 141 :834-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the channel samples intermediate states before it is fully opened by the toxin. We reconstituted a minimal functional TRPV1 channel ( Liao et al., 2013 38. Liao, M. ∙ Cao, E. ∙ Julius, D. ... Structure of the TRPV1 ion channel determined by electron cryo-microscopy Nature. 2013; 504 :107-112 Crossref Scopus (1314) PubMed Google Scholar ) into lipid nanodiscs and applied DkTx prior to freezing cryo-EM grids. Remarkably, we identified a range of substates within the same cryo-EM dataset that are characterized by distinct toxin interactions, pore diameters, coordination of ions by G643 backbone carbonyls (that form the upper restriction/selectivity filter), and accumulation of waters above and below this point ( Figures 1 , S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 ; Table S1 ). As detailed below, these states reveal a series of presumptive sequential events that highlight the dynamic nature of this site, as well as stepwise engagement between DkTx and the channel ( Video S1 ).

Related to Figure 2 A morphing movie in ribbon diagram shows the conformational transition of TRPV1 upon DkTx binding, following the presumptive sequence of events as labeled. Key structural elements, such as π- to α-helix transition, are marked.
First, we observed a “pre-bound” state in which there is evidence of DkTx interaction before a clear toxin density is seen, including movement of elements constituting the known toxin footprint, such as the loop between the pore helix and S5 and the position of specific lipids within the outer membrane leaflet. In the next presumptive state, we observe engagement of a single DkTx molecule to one of two symmetric binding sites on the homo-tetrameric channel, albeit with relatively weak density, suggesting transient attachment to a channel otherwise resembling the pre-bound state ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Next, we see a “pre-open” conformation containing two well-resolved, fully bound DkTx molecules in which the main change involves rotation of M644 away from the central axis ( Figure 1 B), as previously described ( Cao et al., 2013 12. Cao, E. ∙ Liao, M. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms Nature. 2013; 504 :113-118 Crossref Scopus (828) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, with two fully bound DkTx molecules, we observe two additional states (“partial open” and “open”) in which the distance between opposing G643 carbonyls increases from 4.4 Å in the apo state to 6.2 Å and 6.7 Å, respectively. This is accompanied by a range of poses of the resident regulatory phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipid within the vanilloid binding pocket, where the head group and one aliphatic chain of the lipid becomes increasingly mobile as the lower gate diameter increases ( Figure S3 C), and an annular lipid inserts its tail into a hydrophobic cleft between S5 and S6 helices of neighboring subunits ( Figure S3 D).
A particularly interesting feature of these transitional substates is the identification of densities corresponding to presumptive ions and waters within the pore ( Figure 1 ). In apo and pre-bound structures, we see a well-resolved density in the middle of the upper restriction, which we interpret as a fully or partially dehydrated Na + coordinated by four backbone carbonyls of G643 ( Figure 1 B). Water begins to appear in the pre-open state, where it is coordinated by backbone carbonyls of G645, coinciding with rotation of M644 side chains away from the central axis ( Figure 1 B). Transitioning to partial open and open states, coordination of the ion by G643 becomes weaker as the density progressively elongates along the vertical axis to eventually split into two discrete entities ( Figure 1 C), likely reflecting changes in probability distributions of cations within the filter at different conformations. When correlated with opening of the lower gate, the observed increase in water accessible volume in the cavity below ( Figure S4 A) should facilitate rehydration of cations emerging from the selectivity filter ( Figures 1 C, S4 A, and S4B).
DkTx engages the outer pore region of TRPV1, raising the question of how it allosterically opens the lower gate to elicit membrane currents. In examining the transition from the pre-bound to open state, the VSLD is seen to tilt backward progressively ( Figure 2 A), consequently moving S5 (that connects the VSLD with the lower gate) and S6 away from the pore in partial open and open states ( Figure 2 B). By comparing the relative positions of two points (V469 at the top of VSLD and I679 at the lower gate) in apo and substate structures identified above, we see a sequential movement beginning with backward tilting of VSLD at pre-bound and pre-open states that does not move I679. Further sideward tilting or twisting of VSLD at partial open and open states is then accompanied by backward movement of S6 and a π- to α-helix transition that introduces a kink at the bottom of S6 and rotates the lower half of S6 by one residue, replacing I679 with L678 ( Figures 2 C and S4 C). Furthermore, M682 is rotated from a hydrophobic nest, where its side chain density is fully resolved ( Figure S4 D), to a position facing the pore, where it now forms the narrowest point in the lower gate ( Figures S4 A and S4B). The widest distance between sulfur atoms of two opposing M682 in the open conformation is 6.5 Å, producing a pore radius of 1.4 Å, which is sufficient to permeate water and partially dehydrated cations ( Figure S4 J). When facing the pore, M682 loses its hydrophobic interaction with neighboring residues and becomes flexible (as evidenced from the less well-resolved side chain densities in these two substates) ( Figures S4 E–S4I), likely making the pore radius larger than that measured from the built model. We thus designate these two substates as “partial open” and “open.” Additionally, S6 shifts continually backward ( Figure S4 C), consistent with progressive gating transitions.
Only when DkTx is fully engaged with the channel (in the open state), is the tilt and twist of VSLD sufficient to allosterically open the lower gate. Thus, we propose that the VSLD is a main module that allosterically couples changes in the outer pore to the lower gate and does so in a “tunable” manner, as further illustrated below in the case of proton modulation. Our observation of VSLD movement relative to the pore domain is reminiscent of previously described rotation of VSLD relative to the pore region in TRPV3 upon activation by 2-APB ( Singh et al., 2018 55. Singh, A.K. ∙ McGoldrick, L.L. ∙ Sobolevsky, A.I. Structure and gating mechanism of the transient receptor potential channel TRPV3 Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :805-813 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, this region moves differently in voltage-gated channels, where sliding of the S4 helix in response to changes in membrane voltage promotes backward movement of S5 to open the gate ( Figure 2 D) ( Wisedchaisri et al., 2019 61. Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ McCord, E. ... Resting-State Structure and Gating Mechanism of a Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Cell. 2019; 178 :993-1003.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), highlighting a mechanistically distinct manner in which this architecturally conserved domain regulates channel gating.
When activated by vanilloid agonists, TRPV1 is permeable to mono- and divalent cations, as well as large organic cations ( Binshtok et al., 2007 10. Binshtok, A.M. ∙ Bean, B.P. ∙ Woolf, C.J.

Permeation and block of TRPV1 channels by the cationic lidocaine derivative QX-314 J. Neurophysiol. 2013; 109 :1704-1712 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our previous studies did not reveal changes in selectivity filter conformation unless DkTx was present to stabilize the outer pore region ( Cao et al., 2013 12. Cao, E. ∙ Liao, M. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms Nature. 2013; 504 :113-118 Crossref Scopus (828) PubMed Google Scholar ). To ask whether this same dynamic change in pore radius accounts for vanilloid-evoked permeation by large cations, we determined structures of the RTX-activated channel in the presence of both N-methyl- d -glucamine (NMDG) and the lidocaine derivative QX-314 ( Figures S1 G–S1I), each of which are reported to act as permeating organic cations ( Jara-Oseguera et al., 2019 33. Jara-Oseguera, A. ∙ Huffer, K.E. ∙ Swartz, K.J. The ion selectivity filter is not an activation gate in TRPV1-3 channels eLife. 2019; 8 :e51212 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Puopolo et al., 2013 49. Puopolo, M. ∙ Binshtok, A.M. ∙ Yao, G.L. ... Permeation and block of TRPV1 channels by the cationic lidocaine derivative QX-314 J. Neurophysiol. 2013; 109 :1704-1712 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). The first snapshot captures the channel in a conformation resembling that of the open state seen with DkTx, and in which only a Na + ion is loosely coordinated within the filter ( Figure 3 A). In the next snapshot, we see a density that can be modeled as NMDG just as it engages with the upper restriction, displacing the Na + ion further down the pore. In the last snapshot, NMDG has entered completely into the restriction site. In each case, the overall conformation of the outer pore resembles that stabilized by DkTx in which M644 is rotated away from the pore, consistent with prior mutagenesis studies implicating the outer pore domain as a key determinant of dynamic ion selectivity ( Munns et al., 2015 42. Munns, C.H. ∙ Chung, M.K. ∙ Sanchez, Y.E. ... Role of the outer pore domain in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 dynamic permeability to large cations J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :5707-5724 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the pore loop is shifted, the VSLD is tilted backward ( Figure 3 B), and the channel is fully open ( Figures 3 C and 3F). The surprising similarity between the RTX/NMDG and RTX/DkTx (PDB: 5irx ) structures ( Figures 3 D and 3E) suggests that dynamic behavior of the selectivity filter is enhanced by the vanilloid agonist and stabilized by DkTx or a large cation ( Figure 3 G; Video S2 ).

Related to Figure 3 A morphing movie in ribbon diagram shows the conformational transition of TRPV1 from apo to RTX-bound with NMDG in the pore. Note that there is no π- to α-helix transition.
The selectivity filter in TRPV1, defined by backbone carbonyls of G643 alone, is shallow and dynamic ( Figure 3 H). Adaptation of the pore diameter, captured above in the presence of DkTx or NMDG, allows for coordination of cations of different sizes within the filter ( Figure 3 I), even asymmetrically. Likely, the presence of different extracellular cations biases the selectivity filter to adopt conformations suitable for their permeation. This is in sharp contrast with the rigid selectivity filter of highly selective cation channels, such as voltage-gated K + channels ( Zhou et al., 2001 65. Zhou, Y. ∙ Morais-Cabral, J.H. ∙ Kaufman, A. ... Chemistry of ion coordination and hydration revealed by a K+ channel-Fab complex at 2.0 A resolution Nature. 2001; 414 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (1803) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which backbone carbonyls of 4–5 pore-lining residues coordinate 3–4 fully dehydrated K + ions ( Figure 3 J), a stable configuration that disfavors larger or smaller cations ( Figure 3 K). Our results are also consistent with biophysical studies ( Jara-Oseguera et al., 2019 33. Jara-Oseguera, A. ∙ Huffer, K.E. ∙ Swartz, K.J. The ion selectivity filter is not an activation gate in TRPV1-3 channels eLife. 2019; 8 :e51212 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the upper restriction of TRPV1 is permeable to Na + in the apo state and does not function as a classic “open-and-closed” gate.
To favor permeation by large organic cations, we purposefully lowered sodium concentration. Although this did not facilitate visualization of QX-314 or YO-PRO-1 in the upper restriction site, it fortuitously allowed us to capture distinct substates of RTX binding, providing an opportunity to resolve questions pertaining to stoichiometry and cooperativity of vanilloid binding and the competitive relationship with regulatory PI lipids. Thus, in an RTX-containing sample with 9 mM Na + with QX-314, we observed several configurations of the resident PI lipid ranging from fully intact densities to pockets with weakened aliphatic lipid tails, with the tail but not inositol head group, or with the full lipid displaced by RTX. In a sample containing 60 mM Na + with YO-PRO-1, intact RTX densities are seen in all pockets with no trace of the resident PI lipid ( Figure 4 A). Together, these intermediates suggest a two-step process by which vanilloid agonists displace the regulatory lipid, first competing off the aliphatic tail followed by displacement of the headgroup.
In the low sodium (9 mM) sample, we observed all possible tetrameric intermediates with no apparent preference for relative binding position ( Figure 4 B). For example, in substates containing two RTX molecules, binding is observed in para and ortho positions with almost equal prevalence. Only once the PI lipid is completely displaced from a given subunit do we see obvious movement of S5, which is restricted to that subunit and insufficient to induce movement of the cognate S6 helix ( Figure S5 ). Together with the higher sodium sample (60 mM), we see that all four endogenous PI lipids must be fully displaced by RTX to induce sufficient S5 movement in all subunits. In this case, the lower gate assumes two different “closed” conformations (C 1 and C 2 ); in C 1 , the S5 movement is still incremental and S6 does not move, whereas in C 2 , S5 moves sufficiently to enable S6 movement ( Figure S5 ). Overall, the level of movement of S5 correlates closely with the level of RTX engagement in the vanilloid pocket: only fully engaged RTX causes sufficient S5 movement to allow S6 movement, a necessity to open the lower gate.
The two substates captured above have different closed conformations: C 1 has a π-helix in S6 and the pore is closed by I679 (5.7 Å), whereas C 2 has an α-helix in S6 with the pore closed by M682 (5.0 Å). To confirm that both are relevant to channel gating, we further determined structures of full-length TRPV1 with RTX bound under normal buffer conditions. As endpoint references, we also determined structures of full-length TRPV1 at neutral pH in apo and RTX/DkTx bound state. These are largely indistinguishable from their minimal channel counterparts except for an unstructured density above the outer pore contributed by the turret ( Figures S6 A–S6E).
We captured three different substates of the full-length channel bound to RTX (labeled as C 1 , O 1 , and C 2 ) ( Figures S6 F–S6N). In each case, the selectivity filter remains unchanged from the apo state, RTX is fully engaged in all four vanilloid pockets, and S5 moves backward to a similar position, with the main difference seen in S6, which moves progressively backward from substates C 1 to C 2 ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Video S3 ). C 1 resembles the RTX C 1 of the minimal channel with a closed gate ( Figures S6 F and S6H–S6J). Although the distance of opposite gating residue I679 is increased from 5.1 Å in apo state to 5.8 Å and pore radius from 0.8 Å to 1.1 Å, it is insufficient to permeate water or partially dehydrated cations ( Figures 5 C and S6 I–S6K). O 1 has an open gate, in which the distance between opposite I679 is increased to 6.8 Å and pore radius to 1.7 Å, sufficient to permeate partially or fully dehydrated cation ( Figures 5 C, S6 I, S6J, and S6L). C 2 resembles RTX C 2 of the minimal channel ( Figures S6 G–S6J), in which the π-helix in S6 transitions to α-helix. Although the S6 has moved further backward, M682 becomes the new gating residue. The pore profile calculated from the model shows a closed gate ( Figure 5 C). However, we observe a clear density that appears to be a cation coordinated by four sulfur atoms of M682 ( Figures S6 M and S6N). Although very rare, sulfur from methionine has been found to coordinate Na + ( Guskov et al., 2016 27. Guskov, A. ∙ Jensen, S. ∙ Faustino, I. ... Coupled binding mechanism of three sodium ions and aspartate in the glutamate transporter homologue Glt Tk Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13420 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ), with an atom-to-atom distance of ∼2.7 Å ( Zhou et al., 2021 66. Zhou, W. ∙ Trinco, G. ∙ Slotboom, D.J. ... On the Role of a Conserved Methionine in the Na + -Coupling Mechanism of a Neurotransmitter Transporter Homolog. Neurochem. Res. 2021; Published online February 9, 2021 Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar ). If this density corresponds to a coordinated Na + , then the C 2 conformation is permeable to partially dehydrated cations. Capturing three distinct conformations from the same dataset suggests that the channel can switch between these substates upon activation by a vanilloid agonist, consistent with the characteristic “flickery” behavior observed in single channel recording of RTX or capsaicin-activated TRPV1 ( Bohlen et al., 2010 11. Bohlen, C.J. ∙ Priel, A. ∙ Zhou, S. ... A bivalent tarantula toxin activates the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, by targeting the outer pore domain Cell. 2010; 141 :834-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, these structures reveal multiple substates upon agonist binding while validating the minimal or full-length channel as valid models to dissect structural elements of channel gating.

Local tissue acidosis is a driver of pain hypersensitivity, which is mediated, in part, through TRPV1 ( Caterina et al., 2000 14. Caterina, M.J. ∙ Leffler, A. ∙ Malmberg, A.B. ...

Structure-function studies have identified two negatively charged residues (E600 and E648) as key sites underlying sensitivity of TRPV1 to extracellular protons ( Ahern et al., 2005 3. Ahern, G.P. ∙ Brooks, I.M. ∙ Miyares, R.L. ... Extracellular cations sensitize and gate capsaicin receptor TRPV1 modulating pain signaling J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :5109-5116 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jordt et al., 2000 34. Jordt, S.E. ∙ Tominaga, M. ∙ Julius, D. Acid potentiation of the capsaicin receptor determined by a key extracellular site Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :8134-8139 Crossref Scopus (558) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the “minimal” TRPV1 construct, we have previously shown that E600 resides in an extracellular loop that undergoes substantial movement upon channel opening, suggesting that protonation of E600 disrupts hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the apo configuration ( Cao et al., 2013 12. Cao, E. ∙ Liao, M. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms Nature. 2013; 504 :113-118 Crossref Scopus (828) PubMed Google Scholar ). In light of evidence that the turret region (that is missing from the minimal channel) influences proton-mediated potentiation ( Liao et al., 2013 38. Liao, M. ∙ Cao, E. ∙ Julius, D. ... Structure of the TRPV1 ion channel determined by electron cryo-microscopy Nature. 2013; 504 :107-112 Crossref Scopus (1314) PubMed Google Scholar ), we used the full-length TRPV1 to further probe structural mechanisms underlying proton modulation. We first examined the channel at pH 6, which represents a threshold proton concentration for TRPV1 activation at room temperature ( Hazan et al., 2015 28. Hazan, A. ∙ Kumar, R. ∙ Matzner, H. ...

The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli Neuron. 1998; 21 :531-543 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2697) PubMed Google Scholar ). From this one dataset, 3D classification revealed three distinct conformations, which we refer to as pH6a, pH6b, and pH6c ( Figures 6 A, 6B, S7 C, and S7D). In the apo structure at neutral pH, E600 engages in a salt bridge interaction with R455 in the VSLD of the neighboring subunit ( Figures 6 A, left panel, and 6 D, left panel), restricting motion around this locale. In all three pH6 structures, the E600 side chain rotates away from R455 ( Figures 6 A, second to fourth panels), consistent with protonation of E600 and a marked increase in calculated pK a from 5.2 to 8.4 ( Figure 6 C). Rotation also weakens hydrogen bonding between the backbone nitrogen of E600 and backbone carbonyl of N652, as surmised from an increased distance (2.8 Å to 4.4 Å) between these points in apo versus pH6a structures, which is greater in pH6b and pH6c conformers (6.4 Å and 8.6Å, respectively). Interestingly, Y653, which exhibits distinct orientations in open and closed conformations, is also differentially oriented in pH6a and b versus pH6c configurations ( Figure 6 A), as expected for transitional substates. Furthermore, disruption of the E600-R455 interaction is accompanied by backward tilting of the VSLD and progressive movement of the pore loop toward the open channel conformation ( Figure 6 D), producing an outer pore cavity with a slightly more negatively charged surface ( Figure S7 C).
These changes alter the local environment and suggest that protonation of E600 proceeds, and possibly drives, subsequent protonation at E648 ( Figure 6 B). Indeed, density maps at pH 6 show two possible rotameric side chain positions for E648, which are close to or pointing away from K639 (separated by ∼3.7 Å and 8.2 Å, respectively) ( Figure 6 B). Calculated pK a values for these two rotamers are also markedly different (4.7 versus 6.6, respectively) ( Figure 6 C), suggesting that the one pointing away from K639 predominates as the protonated species. Indeed, the density distribution between these rotameric positions shifts toward the species with a higher pK a value (i.e., further from K639) in the pH6c conformation compared to pH6a. Interestingly, the side chain density is less well-resolved for the pH6b species, suggesting that it is intermediate between pH6a and pH6c conformers ( Figure 6 B).
Although the pH6c conformation shows hallmarks of the open state, the outer restriction/selectivity filter is not as fully dilated as DkTx/RTX or NMDG stabilized structures, the S5 movement is visible but insufficient to move S6 ( Figure S7 D), and the pore profile is not as wide as that seen in the fully open state ( Figure S7 D). To ask whether further acidification can promote a complete transition, we lowered the pH even further to 5.5, which was the practical limit for maintaining protein stability. However, this structure showed no further conformational changes beyond that seen in the pH6c structure, even when the lower gate was stabilized by RTX ( Figure S7 ). Consistent with this, only one conformation similar to pH6c was observed at pH 5.5, suggesting that we reached the limit of proton-evoked transitions. Although mutation of residues other than E600 and E648 has been shown to affect pH sensitivity, our results support the conclusion that they are not directly involved in proton detection ( Aneiros et al., 2011 5. Aneiros, E. ∙ Cao, L. ∙ Papakosta, M. ... The biophysical and molecular basis of TRPV1 proton gating EMBO J. 2011; 30 :994-1002 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ryu et al., 2007 52. Ryu, S. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Yao, J. ... Uncoupling proton activation of vanilloid receptor TRPV1 J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :12797-12807 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Protons and DkTx target the outer pore region but also alter status of the lower gate ( Figure 7 A). Our structures suggest that protonation of E600 and E648 affects discrete regions that can be roughly divided into the outer VSLD and central pore module, respectively. The former induces movement of the S4–S5 linker and generates space to allow for movement of S6, poising the lower gate for opening, whereas the latter destabilizes the upper restriction to facilitate transition to a fully protonated conformation, as noted above. DkTx binding also alters the ionic interaction between E600 and R455 and induces the VSLD to undergo a similar outward tilt concomitant with outward movement of S5, thereby facilitating opening of the lower gate. Interestingly, the lower gate is more dilated in the presence of DkTx than at pH 6. The distortion of the bilayer by DkTx leads to insertion of a lipid tail into a hydrophobic cleft between S5 and S6 helices of neighboring subunits, thereby serving as a wedge to stabilize the lower gate. In the case of RTX, we see neither backward tilting of the VSLD nor appreciable widening of the upper restriction, indicating that the primary action of vanilloid agonists is to open the lower gate, which is sufficient to elicit ion flux through the channel. At the same time, our results with NMDG suggest that allosteric coupling works in both directions because binding of RTX favors the most open conformation of the upper restriction (as revealed under these stabilizing conditions), consistent with more rapid action of DkTx in the presence of vanilloid agonists ( Bohlen et al., 2010 11. Bohlen, C.J. ∙ Priel, A. ∙ Zhou, S. ... A bivalent tarantula toxin activates the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, by targeting the outer pore domain Cell. 2010; 141 :834-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We notice that when the channel is activated by a single agonist, either DkTx or RTX alone, movement of S6 is coupled with a π-helix to α-helix transition ( Videos S1 and S3 ) resembling that seen in the full-length squirrel TRPV1 channel ( Nadezhdin et al., 2021 43. Nadezhdin, K.D. ∙ Neuberger, A. ∙ Nikolaev, Y.A. ... Extracellular cap domain is an essential component of the TRPV1 gating mechanism Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :2154 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, this transition is not seen when an agonist is bound in the vanilloid pocket and the upper restriction is stabilized by either DkTx ( Cao et al., 2013 12. Cao, E. ∙ Liao, M. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms Nature. 2013; 504 :113-118 Crossref Scopus (828) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gao et al., 2016 22. Gao, Y. ∙ Cao, E. ∙ Julius, D. ... TRPV1 structures in nanodiscs reveal mechanisms of ligand and lipid action Nature. 2016; 534 :347-351 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ) or NMDG ( Video S2 ), in which case S5 and S6 movements are the largest among all structures described in this study. Interestingly, movements of S6 can be roughly characterized as small, intermediate, or large ( Figure 7 B). When the movement is small, such as in going from the apo to O 1 of RTX bound full-length structure, the π-helix is retained and the channel gate is formed by I679. In the intermediate category, exemplified by DkTx partial open and open (O 2 ) and C 2 of minimal or full-length channel, the π-helix transitions to an α-helix and the gate is formed by M682. When the S5/S6 movement is large, as seen in RTX/DkTx or RTX/NMDG structures (O 3 ), a π-helix configuration is observed and the open gate (9.8 Å) is formed by I679. Transitions between π and α have also been seen in TRPV2 and V3 structure ( Singh et al., 2018 55. Singh, A.K. ∙ McGoldrick, L.L. ∙ Sobolevsky, A.I.

Commun. 2018; 9 :4773 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the functional consequences of such transitions remain to be fully appreciated. Our more extensive observations with TRPV1 suggest that they may account for multiple closed and open substates and/or rapid transitions between substates typically observed following activation by capsaicin ( Hui et al., 2003 30. Hui, K. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Qin, F. Capsaicin activation of the pain receptor, VR1: multiple open states from both partial and full binding Biophys.

Section: Discussion

Permeability of P2X or TRP channels to large organic cations has been proposed to occur through a controversial process known as “pore dilation” whereby repetitive or prolonged channel activation leads to dramatic changes in size selectivity ( Bean, 2015 7. Bean, B.P. Pore dilation reconsidered Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :1534-1535 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chung et al., 2008 15. Chung, M.K. ∙ Güler, A.D. ∙ Caterina, M.J. TRPV1 shows dynamic ionic selectivity during agonist stimulation Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11 :555-564 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khakh et al., 1999 36. Khakh, B.S. ∙ Bao, X.R. ∙ Labarca, C. ... Neuronal P2X transmitter-gated cation channels change their ion selectivity in seconds Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2 :322-330 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). Irrespective of whether or to what extent this involves a use- and time-dependent mechanism, high resolution TRP channel structures described here and elsewhere now show that dynamic changes in the outer pore and selectivity filter can accommodate small and large cations, upholding at least one intriguing aspect of the pore dilation hypothesis—namely, that pore size need not be limited to a fixed open state, but can be adaptive.
QX-314 and NMDG behave as permeant blockers that impede the flow of smaller Na + ions, likely reflecting their relatively tight, but transient binding within the pore, perhaps explaining why we see NMDG poised within the outer pore region, but not deeper in the pathway. Future studies using various organic cations and channel activation parameters may reveal a more complete series of intermediates that detail movement along the length of the pore. In any event, elucidating dynamic transitions associated with selectivity filter flexibility is pertinent to understanding structural mechanisms that may be exploited to develop modality-specific analgesics or target drug delivery to nociceptive neurons in the pain pathway ( Binshtok et al., 2007 10. Binshtok, A.M. ∙ Bean, B.P. ∙ Woolf, C.J.

Neurophysiol. 2013; 109 :1704-1712 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Improvements in cryo-EM data collection and analysis have transformed our ability to identify structural subclasses of protein complexes that represent functional substates. These advances promise to revolutionize molecular pharmacology by providing direct visual insight into key parameters of ligand-receptor interaction, such as binding site competition, stoichiometry, cooperativity, and so forth. This may be especially advantageous for receptors containing multiple ligand binding subunits or where specific binding of unlabeled, low-affinity, or hydrophobic ligands is difficult to measure biochemically. By segmenting substates of TRPV1-ligand interactions, we can now visualize and define precise steps through which endogenous modulators or natural products interact with key regulatory sites to facilitate channel gating.
For example, functional studies implicated E600 and E648 as key sites mediating acid-evoked channel potentiation and activation, respectively. However, a structural understanding of the distinct contribution of these residues to acid sensitivity was lacking. The “snapshots” shown here now resolve this question by revealing a progressive, stepwise process in which protonation of E600 initiates structural rearrangements within the outer pore region that prepare E648 for subsequent protonation. The E600-mediated transition initiates pre-gating movements in the VSLD and pore loop, providing a cogent explanation for how moderate acidosis potentiates sensitivity to other stimuli (heat or vanilloids), and why TRPV1 E648 mutants are sensitized, but not activated by protons ( Jordt et al., 2000 34. Jordt, S.E. ∙ Tominaga, M. ∙ Julius, D. Acid potentiation of the capsaicin receptor determined by a key extracellular site Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :8134-8139 Crossref Scopus (558) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The other important interaction pertains to the interplay between vanilloids and resident PI lipids. Our structures reveal a dynamic competition in which vanilloids first displace the aliphatic PI lipid tail followed by the inositol headgroup. This may be consequential for understanding how different endogenous TRPV1 ligands, such as distinct PI lipid species, endocannabinoids, or endovanilloids, bind to and modulate the channel, which is likely relevant to other TRPV subtypes that harbor lipids in the same location near the lower gate ( van Goor et al., 2020 60. van Goor, M.K. ∙ de Jager, L. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... High-resolution structures of transient receptor potential vanilloid channels: Unveiling a functionally diverse group of ion channels Protein Sci. 2020; 29 :1569-1580 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our structures also suggest that the four vanilloid sites are equivalent, with each contributing incrementally to gating transitions. This is in general agreement with functional studies of the cold-activated TRPM8 channel, where menthol binds to four independent and energetically equivalent sites, eliciting stepwise stabilization of the open state ( Janssens and Voets, 2011 32. Janssens, A. ∙ Voets, T. Ligand stoichiometry of the cold- and menthol-activated channel TRPM8 J. Physiol. 2011; 589 :4827-4835 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). A conceptually similar analysis using concatenated TRPV1 channels suggested that occupancy of only one vanilloid site is sufficient to activate the channel, but this analysis may be complicated by the fact that a mutation (Y511A) introduced to render subunits capsaicin-insensitive may also affect PI lipid binding at the vanilloid site ( Hazan et al., 2015 28. Hazan, A. ∙ Kumar, R. ∙ Matzner, H. ... The pain receptor TRPV1 displays agonist-dependent activation stoichiometry Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :12278 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). In any case, our findings and those of Janssens and Voets (2011) 32. Janssens, A. ∙ Voets, T. Ligand stoichiometry of the cold- and menthol-activated channel TRPM8 J. Physiol. 2011; 589 :4827-4835 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar suggest that TRP channels differ from classic models exemplified by hetero-pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in which two non-equivalent agonist sites are occupied sequentially and with positive cooperativity to elicit gating ( Sine and Claudio, 1991 54. Sine, S.M. ∙ Claudio, T. Gamma- and delta-subunits regulate the affinity and the cooperativity of ligand binding to the acetylcholine receptor J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 :19369-19377 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The existence of two restrictions along the TRPV1 ion permeation pathway reflects distinct points of action for water soluble versus lipophilic agents that modulate upper and lower regions, respectively. Despite their distinct locations, these control points must communicate with one another to ultimately affect ion flux. A comparison of proton- and DkTx-mediated effects reveals a common framework for how modulation of the upper restriction is structurally coupled to the cytoplasmic gate through subtle, but consequential rigid body-like tilting of the VSLD to provoke movement of the S4–S5 linker and S5. Although the specific structural movements are quite different, this is broadly reminiscent of the connection between VSD movements and gating in voltage-gated potassium channels, perhaps in keeping with their common evolutionary roots. Furthermore, our structures are consistent with recent biophysical studies suggesting that the upper restriction is not a true gate with clearly defined open and closed states, but rather a highly dynamic filter that enables permeation by small and large cations while also contributing to modulation of the lower gate ( Jara-Oseguera et al., 2019 33. Jara-Oseguera, A. ∙ Huffer, K.E. ∙ Swartz, K.J. The ion selectivity filter is not an activation gate in TRPV1-3 channels eLife. 2019; 8 :e51212 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, neither protons nor DkTx enhance capsaicin-evoked unitary currents or permeability to divalent cations ( Bohlen et al., 2010 11. Bohlen, C.J. ∙ Priel, A. ∙ Zhou, S. ...

Geron, M. ∙ Kumar, R. ∙ Zhou, W. ... TRPV1 pore turret dictates distinct DkTx and capsaicin gating Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E11837-E11846 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liao et al., 2013 38. Liao, M. ∙ Cao, E. ∙ Julius, D. ... Structure of the TRPV1 ion channel determined by electron cryo-microscopy Nature. 2013; 504 :107-112 Crossref Scopus (1314) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that their main physiologic effect is to facilitate opening of the lower gate. Conversely, vanilloids enhance adaptivity of the upper restriction, demonstrating the duality of allosteric communication between these control points.
In TRPV1 and other TRPV subtypes, side chains of M644 in the upper restriction and M682 in lower gate can switch between two different positions, facing into or away from the pore. When the selectivity filter is not dilated by DkTx or NMDG, M644 faces the pore forming a restriction above backbone carbonyls of G643. In some structures, there is a cation-like density coordinated by the four sulfur atoms of M644. Moreover, mutation of M644 influences ion permeability ratios ( Munns et al., 2015 42. Munns, C.H. ∙ Chung, M.K. ∙ Sanchez, Y.E. ... Role of the outer pore domain in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 dynamic permeability to large cations J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :5707-5724 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the exact role of M644 remains to be fully explored. In the lower gate, M682 forms a new restriction when the S6 π-helix transitions to an α-helix. Again, mutation of M682 ( Susankova et al., 2007 58. Susankova, K. ∙ Ettrich, R. ∙ Vyklicky, L. ... Contribution of the putative inner-pore region to the gating of the transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 channel (TRPV1) J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :7578-7585 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) has not provided clear insight into the role of this residue in channel gating. Our structures now suggest that, when facing the pore without a hydrophobic interaction network, methionine side chains are more flexible than those of other residues that form the selectivity filter (G643) or lower gate (I679). This is more pronounced as the distance between opposing M682 residues increases. We therefore propose that neither M644 nor M682 forms a rigid barrier for cation permeation, and a combination of changes in S6 position and π- to α-helix transitions generates multiple open and closed substates in response to different agonists ( Figure 7 B), as observed in single channel recordings ( Hui et al., 2003 30. Hui, K. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Qin, F. Capsaicin activation of the pain receptor, VR1: multiple open states from both partial and full binding Biophys. J. 2003; 84 :2957-2968 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To study structural mechanisms of proton action, both the intra- and extracellular sides of the channel were exposed to the same low pH environment. To evaluate the potential impact, we calculated pK a values of all potentially protonatable residues facing the cytosol. None showed a significant change of calculated pK a value at low pH conformations. Although we think that the low pH structures are not directly impacted by non-physiologically low intracellular pH, it remains a possibility. Another potential limitation is use of the minimal functional TRPV1 channel for structural studies. As demonstrated here and previously by us and others, we believe that the minimal channel is a valid model system for elucidating gating mechanism. Nonetheless, we do recognize that the electrophysiological behavior of the minimal and full-length channel is not identical.

Sf9 cells were cultured in ESF 921 (Expression Systems) at 27°C. These cells were used for Baculovirus generation. HEK293 GnTI - cells were cultured in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium + 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37°C with 8% CO 2 . These cells are female in origin.
Recombinant minimal functional (amino acids 110 to 603 and 627 to 764; miniV1) and full-length (amino acids 2 to 838; FLV1) rat TRPV1 protein were expressed and purified as previously described ( Liao et al., 2013 38. Liao, M. ∙ Cao, E. ∙ Julius, D. ... Structure of the TRPV1 ion channel determined by electron cryo-microscopy Nature. 2013; 504 :107-112 Crossref Scopus (1314) PubMed Google Scholar ). For nanodisc reconstitution, membrane scaffold protein MSP2N2 was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli . Lipids were prepared as previously described ( Gao et al., 2016 22. Gao, Y. ∙ Cao, E. ∙ Julius, D. ... TRPV1 structures in nanodiscs reveal mechanisms of ligand and lipid action Nature. 2016; 534 :347-351 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ). Purified TRPV1 protein in detergent (DDM) was mixed with MSP2N2 and soybean polar lipid extract (Avanti) using the ratio TRPV1 monomer:MSP2N2:soybean lipid = 1:1.8:80 and incubated on ice for 10-30 min. 2-3 batches of Bio-beads SM2 (Bio-Rad) were added to remove detergents from the mixture with constant rotation for overnight. After adding TEV protease and incubation for 4 hours to cleave the fused MBP tag, the reconstituted channels were cleared by moderate centrifugation via spin filter microtubes (Merck Millipore Ltd.) followed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 100 μM TCEP for the samples miniV1-apo at pH 7.4, miniV1-DkTx at pH 7.4, FLV1-apo at pH7.4, pH 6, FLV1-DkTx/RTX, FLV1-RTX at pH 7.4, pH 5.5. The peak fractions corresponding to tetrameric TRPV1 in lipid nanodisc were pooled, concentrated to around 3.2 mg ml -1 using Amicon Ultra filter device (50-kDa MWCO, Millipore) and analyzed through SDS-PAGE and negative-stain EM followed by immediate cryo-EM grid preparation. Nanodisc reconstituted TRPV1 were used throughout this study. The pH adjustments (to pH 6 or 5.5) or ligands addition (RTX or DkTx) were performed 30 min before cryo-sample preparation.
To prepare sample of channel with RTX, NMDG and QX-314, the reconstituted channels were subjected to size exclusion chromatography equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 6.3 mM NMDG, 100 μM TCEP and 375 μM NaOH. QX-314 and RTX were added into the sample 30 min before cryo-sample preparation. The final buffer contains 12.5 mM HEPES, pH 6.8, 28 mM NMDG, 23 mM QX-314, 64 μM TCEP, 240 μM NaOH and 40 μM RTX. To prepare sample of channel with RTX and QX-314 under 9 mM Na + concentration, the reconstituted channels were subjected to size exclusion chromatography equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mM NaCl, 100 μM TCEP and 6 mM NaOH. QX-314 and RTX were added into the sample 20 min before cryo-sample preparation. The final buffer contains 13.3 mM HEPES, pH 6.85, 25 mM QX-314, 66.7 μM TCEP, 5.6 mM NaOH, 3.3 mM NaCl and 41.7 μM RTX. To prepare sample of channel with RTX and YO-PRO-1 under 60 mM Na + concentration, the reconstituted channels were subjected to size exclusion chromatography equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mM NaCl, 100 μM TCEP and 6 mM NaOH. YO-PRO-1 in DMSO and RTX were added into the sample 20 min before cryo-sample preparation. The final buffer contains 17.6 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 10.3 μM YO-PRO-1, 1% DMSO, 87.9 μM TCEP, 5.3 mM NaOH, 54.5 mM NaCl and 51.7 μM RTX.
For negative-stain EM, 2.5 μl of TRPV1 samples at ∼40 μg ml -1 were applied to a glow discharged Cu grid covered by continuous carbon film, and then stained with 0.75% (w/v) uranyl formate ( Ohi et al., 2004 44. Ohi, M. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... Negative Staining and Image Classification - Powerful Tools in Modern Electron Microscopy Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6 :23-34 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). A Tecnai T12 microscope (ThermoFisher FEI Company) operated at 120 kV was employed to check these negatively stained grids. Micrographs were recorded at a nominal magnification of 52,000 × using an UltraScan 4000 camera (Gatan), corresponding to a pixel size of 2.21 Å on the specimen.
To prepare cryo-EM grids of nanodisc reconstituted TRPV1 in neutral pH, channel was mixed with RTX at final concentration of 40-55 μM in a molar ratio of 1:6.9-9.5, or with DkTx at final concentration of 20 μM in a molar ratio of 1:3.5 for 20-30 min before vitrification. To prepare cryo-EM grids at low pH, nanodisc reconstituted full-length apo channel or preformed complex with RTX at pH 7.4 buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 150 mM NaCl and 100 μM TCEP) was titrated by 1 M Na acetate buffer (pH 4.6) to adjust the final pH to 6 for apo samples or to pH 5.5 for TRPV1-RTX samples. 3 μL samples at 1.5-2.5 mg/ml were applied onto a glow-discharged gold grids covered with holey carbon film (Quantifoil, 300 mesh 1.2/1.3) and blotted using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI Company) with 4.5 s blotting time and 100% humidity at 4 °C for FLV1-apo at neutral pH, pH 6 and FLV1-RTX at pH 5.5, or at 20°C for miniV1-apo at pH 7.4, miniV1-DkTx at pH 7.4, miniV1-RTX/NMDG at pH 6.8, miniV1-RTX/QX-314/9mM Na + at pH 6.85 and miniV1-RTX/ YO-PRO-1/60mM Na + at pH 7.3, FLV1-DkTx/RTX at pH 7.4, FLV1-RTX at pH 7.4 and plunge frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen.
Full-length apo channel at pH 6, in complex with RTX at pH 5.5 and in complex with DkTx/RTX at pH 7.4 were imaged with Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope (ThermoFisher FEI) operated at 200 keV. Full-length apo channel at neutral pH, in complex with RTX at pH 7.4, minimal apo channel at pH 7.4, in complex with DkTx, in complex with RTX/NMDG, in complex with RTX when QX-314 added under 9 mM Na + concentration and in complex with RTX when YO-PRO-1 added under 60 mM Na + concentration were imaged with a Titan Krios microscope (ThermoFisher FEI) operated at 300keV, equipped with a Bio Quantum post-column energy filter with zero-loss energy selection slit set to 20 eV. Both microscopes are equipped with a K2 or K3 camera (Gatan Inc), operating in super-resolution counting mode. Data collections were carried out by using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 40. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3221) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data acquisition parameters, including dose rate, total dose and total frames per movie stack, etc. are summarized in the Table S1 . For minimal channel with DkTx, two separate datasets were collected using the same microscope under the same condition. They were processed separately following the same protocol and combined together in the final stage of image processing.
Motion correction of movie stacks were processed on-the-fly by using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 64. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ), which also bins motion corrected sum 2 × 2 by Fourier cropping. Sums without dose-weighting were used for contrast transfer function (CTF) determination using Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 62. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ) or Patch-Based CTF Estimation in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 48. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dose-weighted sums were used for all other image processing. Particles were picked using a Gaussian template in cisTEM ( Grant et al., 2018 25. Grant, T. ∙ Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. cis TEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing eLife. 2018; 7 :e35383 Crossref Scopus (569) PubMed Google Scholar ) or template selected from previous 2D averages in cryoSPARC followed by reference-free 2D classification (particles binned 4 × 4 during extraction). Particles within junk classes were removed entirely. An ab initio 3D reference model was generated based on the remaining particles by using cryoSPARC, which is then used for 3D classification in RELION-3. Particles within bad classes were further removed and remaining particles were subjected to further analysis. Obvious conformational heterogeneities were seen in the resulting 3D classes of minimal channel in complex with DkTx, with RTX / NMDG, in complex with RTX under 9 mM Na + concentration and in complex with RTX under 60 mM Na + concentration or full-length apo channel at pH 6 and in complex with RTX at pH 7.4. These datasets were subjected to further classification, as described below. No obvious conformational heterogeneity was observed in minimal apo channel, full-length apo channel, full-length channel in complex with RTX at pH 5.5 and in complex with DkTx/RTX at pH 7.4.
For datasets of minimal channel with DkTx, RTX/NMDG or RTX under 9 mM Na + concentration, 3D classification of whole complex with global masks separated all particles into different classes with different conformations. To further improve the resolution and quality of these maps, particles within each conformational class was further C1 symmetry expanded using the program relion_particle_symmetry_expand implemented in RELION-3. The quadrupled particle stack was first subjected to the 3D classification without imposing symmetry using a mask of a single subunit. The bad particles (corresponding to bad subunit) were removed to obtain a cleaner particle stack. The remaining expanded particles were subjected to another round of 3D classification (Relion options:–tau2_fudge 20 –skip align) without local mask for minimal channel with DkTx, which separated symmetry expanded particles into two classes with the orientation of DkTx perpendicular to each other, with outer pore focused mask for minimal channel with RTX/NMDG and with vanilloid pocket focused mask for minimal channel with RTX under 9 mM Na + concentration. For each original particle in minimal channel with DkTx, the orientational parameter of only one expansion belonging to the same DkTx bound class is kept. For each particle in minimal channel with RTX under 9 mM Na + concentration, the presence of endogenous phosphatidylinositol lipid or RTX, their relative orientations and number of occurrences in four subunits are analyzed for distinguishing between different states. The quality of final density maps was further improved with local refinement without symmetry in RELION-3. As a validation control, we purposely calculated maps that contain different percentages of particles from apo states and fully bound RTX state, simulating densities in the vanilloid binding pocket contributed by misclassified particles. As shown in Figure S5 B, these simulated densities are very different from what presented in Figure 4 , supporting that it is largely free of particle misclassification.
For all other datasets, including full-length channel in complex DkTx/RTX at pH 7.4, C4 symmetry was applied in the 3D classification and refinement procedures. The symmetry expansion approach was also used to improve the density quality of Ankyrin repeat domain of apo channel at neutral pH. Directional Fourier Shell Correlation (dFSC) curves are calculated as described ( Dang et al., 2017 17. Dang, S. ∙ Feng, S. ∙ Tien, J. ... Cryo-EM structures of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channel Nature. 2017; 552 :426-429 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the nominal resolution is estimated from the averaged FSC using FSC = 0.143 criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 51. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1612) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution maps were calculated in RELION-3. Conversion of star files from cryoSPARC to RELION-3 was performed using UCSF pyem ( https://zenodo.org/record/3576630#.XuczyFVKjIU ).
Atomic model (PDB accession 3J5P ) were initially docked into the Relion-sharpened density maps with UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 46. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33472) PubMed Google Scholar ) and manually adjusted in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 21. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20218) PubMed Google Scholar ). The models for ligands and associated lipids and their geometric constraints were generated using elBOW module in PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18498) PubMed Google Scholar ) or JLigand module ( Lebedev et al., 2012 37. Lebedev, A.A. ∙ Young, P. ∙ Isupov, M.N. ... JLigand: a graphical tool for the CCP4 template-restraint library Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2012; 68 :431-440 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ) in CCP4 package. All models were refined over multiple rounds using the module ‘phenix.real_space_refine’ ( Afonine et al., 2018 2. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1519) PubMed Google Scholar ) in PHENIX and ISOLDE ( Croll, 2018 16. Croll, T.I. ISOLDE: a physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (780) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 24. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2595) PubMed Google Scholar ). The quality of all refined models was assessed using the ‘comprehensive model validation’ function in PHENIX and wwPDB validation server ( Berman et al., 2003 8. Berman, H. ∙ Henrick, K. ∙ Nakamura, H. Announcing the worldwide Protein Data Bank Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10 :980 Crossref Scopus (2263) PubMed Google Scholar ).
pK a values were calculated in H++ ( Anandakrishnan et al., 2012 4. Anandakrishnan, R. ∙ Aguilar, B. ∙ Onufriev, A.V. H++ 3.0: automating pK prediction and the preparation of biomolecular structures for atomistic molecular modeling and simulations Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 W537-41 Crossref Scopus (1272) PubMed Google Scholar ) as pK_(1/2), which in most cases is equivalent to pK a . For all pKa calculation, pH values were set to the same as in the experiments. HOLE program ( Smart et al., 1996 56. Smart, O.S. ∙ Neduvelil, J.G. ∙ Wang, X. ... HOLE: a program for the analysis of the pore dimensions of ion channel structural models J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 :354-360 376 Crossref Scopus (1260) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to calculate all pore radii. Surface charges of the outer pore region were calculated using the latest version of the program (APBS and pdb2pqr) at pH 7, 6 and 5.5 respectively ( Baker et al., 2001 6. Baker, N.A. ∙ Sept, D. ∙ Joseph, S. ... Electrostatics of nanosystems: application to microtubules and the ribosome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :10037-10041 Crossref Scopus (6146) PubMed Google Scholar ). UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2018 24. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2595) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to make figures.
The relative values of temperature factor were obtained using the same reference as indicated in figure legend and the generation of dot plots were performed using the program Graphpad Prism.
