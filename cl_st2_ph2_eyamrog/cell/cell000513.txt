Title: Differential pre-malignant programs and microenvironment chart distinct paths to malignancy in human colorectal polyps


Abstract: Summary

Colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from precursor polyps whose cellular origins, molecular heterogeneity, and immunogenic potential may reveal diagnostic and therapeutic insights when analyzed at high resolution. We present a single-cell transcriptomic and imaging atlas of the two most common human colorectal polyps, conventional adenomas and serrated polyps, and their resulting CRC counterparts. Integrative analysis of 128 datasets from 62 participants reveals adenomas arise from WNT-driven expansion of stem cells, while serrated polyps derive from differentiated cells through gastric metaplasia. Metaplasia-associated damage is coupled to a cytotoxic immune microenvironment preceding hypermutation, driven partly by antigen-presentation differences associated with tumor cell-differentiation status. Microsatellite unstable CRCs contain distinct non-metaplastic regions where tumor cells acquire stem cell properties and cytotoxic immune cells are depleted. Our multi-omic atlas provides insights into malignant progression of colorectal polyps and their microenvironment, serving as a framework for precision surveillance and prevention of CRC.

Section: Introduction

Classification schemes for human colorectal cancer (CRC) focus largely on intrinsic features of tumor cells, including histopathology, bulk gene expression (Consensus Molecular Subtypes or CMS), chromosomal instability (CIN), hypermethylation (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype or CIMP), and microsatellite-instability (MSI) ( Guinney et al., 2015 46. Guinney, J. ∙ Dienstmann, R. ∙ Wang, X. ... The consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1350-1356 Crossref Scopus (2041) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ogino and Goel, 2008 96. Ogino, S. ∙ Goel, A. Molecular classification and correlates in colorectal cancer J. Mol. Diagn. 2008; 10 :13-27 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tumor immune microenvironment is also critical to CRC pathogenesis ( Pelka et al., 2021 98. Pelka, K. ∙ Hofree, M. ∙ Chen, J.H. ... Spatially organized multicellular immune hubs in human colorectal cancer Cell. 2021; 184 :4734-4752.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hypermutated MSI-high (MSI-H) tumors exhibit a neoantigen-triggered cytotoxic immune infiltration that contributes to their responsiveness to immunotherapy ( Le et al., 2015 69. Le, D.T. ∙ Uram, J.N. ∙ Wang, H. ... PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (5107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Llosa et al., 2015 80. Llosa, N.J. ∙ Cruise, M. ∙ Tam, A. ... The vigorous immune microenvironment of microsatellite instable colon cancer is balanced by multiple counter-inhibitory checkpoints Cancer Discov. 2015; 5 :43-51 Crossref Scopus (826) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a significant subset of low mutation burden CRCs appears to exhibit an activated immune microenvironment via ill-defined mechanisms ( Mlecnik et al., 2016 89. Mlecnik, B. ∙ Bindea, G. ∙ Angell, H.K. ... Integrative Analyses of Colorectal Cancer Show Immunoscore Is a Stronger Predictor of Patient Survival Than Microsatellite Instability Immunity. 2016; 44 :698-711 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesize that mapping the routes toward tumorigenesis in precursors of MSI-H and MSS CRCs will uncover mechanisms that define the CRC cellular landscape and identify targets with diagnostic or therapeutic utility.
Most MSS and MSI-H CRCs develop from pre-cancerous conventional adenomas (ADs) and sessile serrated lesions (SSLs; formerly sessile serrated adenomas/polyps), respectively. As proposed by Vogelstein and co-workers, ADs arise from truncating mutations in APC , which result in activation of the WNT pathway and CIN ( Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990 36. Fearon, E.R. ∙ Vogelstein, B. A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis Cell. 1990; 61 :759-767 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9647) PubMed Google Scholar ). ADs subsequently accumulate gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes (chiefly KRAS ) and loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as TP53 , ultimately forming MSS CRCs. Conversely, SSLs resemble MSI-H CRCs molecularly and are distinct from ADs in that tumorigenesis is not initiated by genetic disruptions of APC ( Crockett and Nagtegaal, 2019 27.

Genetic and epigenetic changes of components affecting the WNT pathway in colorectal carcinomas stratified by microsatellite instability Neoplasia. 2005; 7 :99-108 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, they have epigenetic disruptions, including MLH1 hypermethylation and a 40%–75% prevalence of CIMP ( Leggett and Whitehall, 2010 73. Leggett, B. ∙ Whitehall, V.

Surg. Pathol. 2004; 28 :1452-1459 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). These tumors harbor BRAF mutations in contrast to KRAS mutations commonly present in ADs. Mirroring the relatively lower incidence of MSI-H CRCs and their prevalence in the proximal colon, SSLs represent only 10%–20% of polyps and are also found in the proximal colon more often, unlike the more frequently distal ADs ( Crockett and Nagtegaal, 2019 27.

We present a multi-omic human pre-cancer atlas integrating single-cell transcriptomics, genomics, and immunohistopathology describing the two most common pathways toward CRC. We identify and functionally validate distinct origins and molecular processes that establish divergent tumor landscapes. Notably, this clearer understanding of advanced and highly heterogeneous cancers was enabled only by looking at CRCs through the lens of their originating lesions, paving a path to new strategies for precision prevention, surveillance, and therapeutics.

Section: Results

Polyps, as well as matching normal biopsies, were collected from COLON MAP study participants. Most polyps were small (median diameter ≤5 mm) and were bisected for multi-assay analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and multiplex immunohistochemistry (MxIHC) were performed on two independent sets of specimens collected approximately 1 year apart. The discovery (DIS) set consisted of 65 specimens analyzed including 30 tumors. The validation (VAL) set consisted of 63 specimens analyzed including 32 tumors ( Figure 1 A). Overall, 128 independent scRNA-seq datasets on 62 tumors were generated ( Table S1 ). Specimens were collected from diverse sex, racial, and age groups ( Table S2 ). In addition, we performed bulk RNA-seq and targeted gene sequencing on an orthogonal set of 66 and 281 polyps, respectively ( Figure S1 A; Table S2 ). Polyps were histologically categorized by two pathologists into two subtypes: ADs consisting of tubular ADs (TAs) and tubulovillous ADs (TVAs), or serrated polyps (SERs) consisting of hyperplastic polyps (HPs) and SSLs ( Figure 1 B). While standard histological features were observed for polyps, HPs were further subdivided into goblet cell-rich HPs (GCHPs) and microvesicular HPs (MVHPs), with MVHPs appearing more advanced and may progress to SSLs ( Crockett and Nagtegaal, 2019 27. Crockett, S.D. ∙ Nagtegaal, I.D. Terminology, Molecular Features, Epidemiology, and Management of Serrated Colorectal Neoplasia Gastroenterology. 2019; 157 :949-966 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Epithelial serrations of GCHPs, if present, were subtle and confined to the mucosal surface, while, for MVHPs, serrations extended from the surface to two-thirds down the crypt, sparing the morphologically normal crypt base. In contrast, SSLs showed epithelial serrations that extended to the base of crypts, which were dilated and spread laterally above the muscularis mucosae.
We characterized the mutational profiles of ADs and SERs by conducting whole-exome sequencing (WES) and somatic mutation calling ( Figure 1 C). Due to small polyp sizes and the prioritization of fresh tissue for single-cell assays, we used the clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material for WES. About half generated sufficient sequence quality for analysis, and the predominant mutational patterns were consistent with published literature. APC mutations were detected in 85% of the TAs and in both TVAs. Only one (8%) TA had a KRAS mutation, while both TVAs did, consistent with TVAs being more histologically advanced. All but one SSL (89%) had the oncogenic BRAF V600E mutation; none of the three GCHPs harbored BRAF mutations, but two (67%) MVHPs did, consistent with MVHPs being SSLs in evolution. Neither APC nor KRAS mutations were detected in SSLs, and none of the ADs had BRAF mutations. Somewhat surprisingly, none of the SSLs exhibited a hypermutation phenotype, while a portion of TA/TVAs did. Whereas MLH1 expression is usually lost in MSI-H CRCs due to promoter methylation, MLH1 protein and gene expression in SSLs were comparable to ADs, both higher than the mean MSI-H CRC level ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Biallelic loss in mismatch repair genes was not detected in any polyp, further supporting that these SSLs had not yet acquired a hypermutation phenotype.
We validated this mutational analysis using targeted gene sequencing of a separate set of 281 premalignant tumors ( Figure S1 A). General trends were consistent, with mutations in APC increasing from 67% to 91%, and KRAS from 5% to 42% between TAs and TVAs. BRAF mutations were enriched in SSLs (67%) compared to TAs (1%) and TVAs (4%). Again, none of the SSLs exhibited a high mutation load, where several TA/TVAs did, confirming WES results. Non- APC mutations in WNT pathway genes, such as RNF43 or ZNRF43 , were uncommon in SSLs from either dataset. Signaling pathway analysis from combined mutational analysis paints a picture of WNT-driven tumorigenesis in TA and TVAs but not in SSLs.
We generated scRNA-seq data on 70,691 (DIS dataset) and 71,374 cells (VAL dataset) (total: 142,065), after filtering for high-quality barcodes using dropkick ( Heiser et al., 2021 50. Heiser, C.N. ∙ Wang, V.M. ∙ Chen, B. ... Automated quality control and cell identification of droplet-based single-cell data using dropkick Genome Res. 2021; 31 :1742-1752 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ), and cells from specimens with unconfirmed histology (labeled UNC) were transcriptomically classified ( Table S3 ). We conducted UMAP dimension reduction on raw scRNA-seq data and observed intermixing of epithelial cells from normal colonic biopsies and immune cells from different participants, indicating the absence of batch effects ( Figure S1 D). However, neoplastic cells clustered by sample, demonstrating intertumoral variability consistent with unique tumorigenic processes.
Since transcription factor (TF)-defined regulon activities are considered to be a determinant of cell identity, we used SCENIC (single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering), which is a regulon-based, batch-robust feature extraction tool, to adjust for polyp-specific effects ( Aibar et al., 2017 1. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ; Van de Sande et al., 2020 125. Van de Sande, B. ∙ Flerin, C. ∙ Davie, K. ... A scalable SCENIC workflow for single-cell gene regulatory network analysis Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15 :2247-2276 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clustering and co-embedding epithelial cells from the DIS dataset in regulon space revealed seven normal, canonical epithelial cell populations using normal biopsy datasets as reference landmarks ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Figure S2 A). Polyp specimens also contained substantial numbers of normal cells consistent with their histopathology ( Figures 1 B, 2 B; Figure S2 B; Table S3 ). However, two cell populations were overwhelmingly represented in polyp samples, as determined by sample-by-sample breakdown of proportional cluster representation ( Figures 2 B and 2C; Figure S2 C). One population was enriched in TA and TVA, hereafter referred to as ASCs (AD-specific cells, p < 1E-4 Mann-Whitney U [MWU] test) ( Tables S3 and S4 ). The second neoplastic population was enriched in SSLs and HPs, hereafter referred to as SSCs (serrated-specific cells, p < 1E-4 MWU test). Importantly, these results, as well as others below, were consistent across DIS and VAL datasets ( Figures 2 A–2C; Figures S2 A–S2D), demonstrating rigor and reproducibility.
We identified gene programs and pathways differentially activated in ASCs and SSCs compared to normal epithelial cells. ASCs resembled colonic stem and progenitor cells, expressed genes indicative of WNT pathway activation ( LGR5 , OLFM4 , ASCL2 , AXIN2 , RNF43 , and EPHB2 ) ( Figure 2 A), and possessed a stem cell signature greater than normal stem cells from the same individuals ( Figure 2 D; Figure S2 D; Tables S4 , S5 , and S6 ). Because ASCs resembled normal stem cells, we used CytoTRACE to infer their stem potential ( Gulati et al., 2020 47. Gulati, G.S. ∙ Sikandar, S.S. ∙ Wesche, D.J. ... Single-cell transcriptional diversity is a hallmark of developmental potential Science. 2020; 367 :405-411 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Normal stem cells had high CytoTRACE scores and transitioned into differentiated cells with lower scores ( Figure 2 E; Figure S2 E), forming a score distribution that was relatively uniform between stem, transitioning, and differentiated cells. In contrast, CytoTRACE analysis of ASCs yielded a distribution skewed toward cells with high predicted stem potential ( Figure 2 E; Table S4 ). This variation in stemness suggests the presence of tumor stem cells, supported by the enrichment of WNT-driven stemness GO terms in specific ASC subclusters ( Figure S2 F; Table S6 ). These analyses describe a model wherein WNT-dependent stem cell expansion initiates tumorigenesis in ADs most often driven by loss-of-function mutations in APC .
In marked contrast to ASCs, SSCs did not exhibit WNT pathway activation nor a stem cell signature ( Figures 2 A and 2D; Figures S2 A and S2D). CytoTRACE scores of SSCs skewed toward a lower predicted stem potential, opposite to ASCs ( Figure 2 E; Figure S2 E), although heterogeneity in stemness was still observed ( Figure S2 F; Table S6 ). The transcriptomic profiles of SSCs resembled absorptive-lineage cells, but SSCs also expressed functional goblet cell genes, including TFF3 and MUC2 , but surprisingly without the master secretory cell TF ATOH1 and the ATOH1 regulon, suggesting SSCs harbor a mixed cellular identity ( Figure 2 A; Figure S2 G). To this point, SSCs highly expressed genes not normally observed in the colon ( MUC5AC , AQP5 , TACSTD2 [TROP2], TFF2 , MUC17 , and MSLN ) but rather found in other endodermal organs, most notably, the gastric epithelium ( Figures 2 A and 2D; Figure S2 D; Tables S4 , S5 , and S6 ). This surprising finding, along with the expression of differentiated cell gene signatures in SSC, led us to hypothesize metaplasia may underlie the pathogenesis of SSLs.
Metaplasia is a process by which differentiated cells transdifferentiate to non-native cell types, often occurring as a regenerative mechanism after damage. Loss of CDX2 , a hindgut homeobox TF, in the colon is associated with an imperfect pyloric-type gastric metaplasia and a shift toward expression of genes more rostral in the rostral-caudal gradient ( Balbinot et al., 2018 7. Balbinot, C. ∙ Armant, O. ∙ Elarouci, N. ... The Cdx2 homeobox gene suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :911-926 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tong et al., 2017 120. Tong, K. ∙ Pellón-Cárdenas, O. ∙ Sirihorachai, V.R. ... Degree of Tissue Differentiation Dictates Susceptibility to BRAF-Driven Colorectal Cancer Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3833-3845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). CDX2 was expressed in most colonic cell types, including ASCs; however, it was downregulated in SSCs, supporting a loss of regional identity in these cells ( Figure 2 A). This loss of caudal identity in SSCs was accompanied by a reversion to an embryonic stage, supported by a fetal gene-expression signature, including the MDK gene, which encodes a heparin-binding growth factor only transiently expressed in early colonic development ( Figures 2 A and 2D; Figures S2 A and S2D; Tables S4 and S5 ) ( Park et al., 2005 97. Park, Y.-K. ∙ Franklin, J.L. ∙ Settle, S.H. ... Gene expression profile analysis of mouse colon embryonic development Genesis. 2005; 41 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Luminal retinoic acid-induced absorptive cell-differentiation genes ( RXRA/RARA/ALDOB ) were increased in SSCs ( Lukonin et al., 2020 81. Lukonin, I. ∙ Serra, D. ∙ Challet Meylan, L. ... Phenotypic landscape of intestinal organoid regeneration Nature. 2020; 586 :275-280 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), while rostral identity genes suppressed in absorptive cell differentiation ( ANAX10/ANXA1 ) were also paradoxically increased ( Figure 2 A). These gene signatures depict a loss of colonic identity and provide further evidence that SSCs arise from a metaplastic process.
We used TF target similarity to create a common TF regulatory network depicting the coordinated regulation of genes as programs and pathways. Some coordinated clusters of regulons, which we referred to as super-regulons, were overrepresented in ASCs versus SSCs, including WNT- and Hippo-driven super-regulons marked by MYC, ASCL2, TCF7, and TEAD1 activities ( Figure 2 F; Figure S2 G), consistent with the role of these programs in the regeneration and renewal of intestinal stem cells ( Ayyaz et al., 2019 5. Ayyaz, A. ∙ Kumar, S. ∙ Sangiorgi, B. ... Single-cell transcriptomes of the regenerating intestine reveal a revival stem cell Nature. 2019; 569 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ; Murata et al., 2020 93. Murata, K. ∙ Jadhav, U. ∙ Madha, S. ... Ascl2-Dependent Cell Dedifferentiation Drives Regeneration of Ablated Intestinal Stem Cells Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 26 :377-390.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). For SSCs, supporting the role of a damage-induced metaplastic process, a super-regulon indicating interleukin signaling and microbiota interaction was observed ( Figure 2 G; Figure S2 G). Specifically, upregulated transcription factor activities for SSCs included RELB (nuclear factor κB [NF-κB] signaling), IRF1, IRF6, and IRF7, reflecting an immunogenic state ( Figures 2 A and 2G), which was corroborated by gene set enrichment for microbial infection response, innate immune activation, and epithelial wound-healing pathways ( Table S6 ) ( Raudvere et al., 2019 102. Raudvere, U. ∙ Kolberg, L. ∙ Kuzmin, I. ... g:Profiler: a web server for functional enrichment analysis and conversions of gene lists (2019 update) Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W191-W198 Crossref Scopus (832) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting the activation of interferon response elements, coordinated upregulation of inflammasome-related genes such as IL18 and gasdermins further implicated responses to external pathogens as triggers of metaplasia ( Figure 2 A) ( Man, 2018 82. Man, S.M. Inflammasomes in the gastrointestinal tract: infection, cancer and gut microbiota homeostasis Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 15 :721-737 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, regulons related to FOSL2, KLF4, and ATF3 were enriched ( Figure 2 G; Figure S2 G), drawing parallels to recent work documenting increased chromatin accessibility of these TF targets in a mouse model of microbiota-driven colitis ( Ansari et al., 2020 4. Ansari, I. ∙ Raddatz, G. ∙ Gutekunst, J. ... The microbiota programs DNA methylation to control intestinal homeostasis and inflammation Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :610-619 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene signatures classifying polyp subtypes were validated with bulk RNA-seq on an additional 58 ADs (36 TAs, 22 TVAs) and eight SSLs ( Figure S2 H). These results confirmed our findings of a WNT-activated program of stem cell expansion in ADs, and a program of gastric metaplasia, likely arising from a committed cell lineage, in SSLs.
Because SSCs may arise from metaplasia of differentiated cells, we hypothesized that SERs originate from differentiated cells in a “top-down” model of tumorigenesis, compared to ADs arising from proliferative stem cells in a “bottom-up” fashion. To provide histological evidence of tumor origins, we mapped the location of neoplastic cells by multiplex imaging. Stem cell markers, OLFM4 and SOX9, were abundant in ADs but were significantly reduced in HPs and SSLs ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Figures S3 A and S3B). Nuclear CDX2 was detected in the normal colon and in ADs but was decreased in HPs and absent in SSLs ( Figure 3 C; Figure S3 C). MUC5AC, a marker of SSCs, was highly expressed in HPs and SSLs but not in normal biopsies and ADs ( Figure 3 D; Figure S3 D). Interestingly, MUC5AC-positive, neoplastic cells were often observed at the top of the crypt with normal-appearing MUC5AC-negative cells at the crypt bottom, implying a non-crypt origin of SERs. MUC5AC-positive cells first appeared at the luminal surface in GCHPs and then extended further to the crypt base in MVHPs and SSLs ( Figures S3 D and S3E), consistent with the histopathological progression of these SERs ( Figure 1 B) and supporting the luminal surface origin of SSCs. MUC5AC-positive cells were detected in the majority of abnormal crypts from SERs ( Figure S3 F) but were largely absent in the normal colon. However, occasional MUC5AC staining was detected, again, at the luminal surface in a few specimens, and was further increased in ulcerative colitis patients ( Figure S3 G ) . Luminal surface colonic cells appear susceptible to damage-induced metaplasia that may elicit serrated polyp formation if the damage is not resolved.
We inferred transition trajectories from epithelial cells using p-Creode on batch-robust SCENIC regulons, which produced a stereotypical colonic differentiation hierarchy ( Herring et al., 2018 51. Herring, C.A. ∙ Banerjee, A. ∙ McKinley, E.T. ... Unsupervised Trajectory Analysis of Single-Cell RNA-Seq and Imaging Data Reveals Alternative Tuft Cell Origins in the Gut Cell Syst. 2018; 6 :37-51 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). CytoTRACE score and WNT target gene overlays identified the stem cell branch, which was shared with ASCs, suggesting aberrantly expanded stem cells as the origin of ADs ( Figure 3 E; Figure S3 H). In marked contrast, SSCs were inferred to develop from absorptive progenitors and colonocytes. RNA velocity analysis on individual tumors largely confirmed these findings ( Figure 3 F; Figure S3 I) ( Bergen et al., 2020 12. Bergen, V. ∙ Lange, M. ∙ Peidli, S. ... Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1408-1414 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ; La Manno et al., 2018 68. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ). In normal specimens, velocity vectors originated from stem cells and flowed into differentiated cell types. ASCs were implicated to develop from stem cells, but the velocity vectors were reversed for SSCs, suggesting the origin of these cells to be non-stem cells.
To further infer shared origins, we determined phylogenetic distances from genetic variants between normal and neoplastic cells. We used DENDRO (DNA-based evolutionary tree prediction by scRNA-seq technology), a phylogenetic reconstruction algorithm on scRNA-seq data that adjusts for inherent data sparsity ( Zhou et al., 2020 143. Zhou, Z. ∙ Xu, B. ∙ Minn, A. ... DENDRO: genetic heterogeneity profiling and subclone detection by single-cell RNA sequencing Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :10 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). We improved on DENDRO’s robustness, and exonic variants detected were further validated through WES of paired FFPE tissues. DENDRO reconstruction of 34 polyps showed that ASCs were more genetically related to crypt base stem cells than SSCs (p < 5E-02 MWU test) ( Figures S3 J and S3K; Table S1 ). In fact, SSCs often clustered genetically with differentiated colonocytes and absorptive progenitors ( Figure S3 J). Orthogonal methodologies produced histological, transcriptomic, and genetic evidence to support the hypothesis that ADs arise from dysregulation of the stem cell compartment, but SSLs appear to arise from a developmentally committed cell.
We performed scRNA-seq on seven (two MSI-H, five MSS) fresh CRC specimens and procured a CRC scRNA-seq dataset (n = 60; 32 MSI-H, 28 MSS) from the Broad Institute for validation. Furthermore, we analyzed whole tumor blocks from 26 additional CRC patients (14 MSI-H, 12 MSS) ( Table S7 ). WES of CRC specimens revealed expected mutational features in MSS CRCs following the conventional tumorigenesis pathway with APC (100%), KRAS (35%), and TP53 (71%) mutations ( Figure S4 A). MSI-H CRCs had fewer of these conventional mutations (33%, 0%, 7%, respectively) but more BRAF mutations (53% in MSI-H versus 0% in MSS). All MSI-H CRCs were hypermutated compared to MSS CRCs. Histologically, all CRCs showed invasive adenocarcinoma with cribriform architecture ( Figure S4 B), with MSI-H CRCs exhibiting mucinous features.
scRNA-seq data of malignant CRC cells revealed substantial tumor-to-tumor variability, as seen by others ( Lee et al., 2020 71. Lee, H.-O. ∙ Hong, Y. ∙ Etlioglu, H.E. ... Lineage-dependent gene expression programs influence the immune landscape of colorectal cancer Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :594-603 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pelka et al., 2021 98.

Spatially organized multicellular immune hubs in human colorectal cancer Cell. 2021; 184 :4734-4752.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ) even after regulon-based embedding ( Figure 4 A). Combined with our pre-cancer data, an increase in intertumoral heterogeneity was observed as epithelial cells transition from normal to pre-cancer to malignant cells. We considered that the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of CRC transcriptomics might be reduced by looking at CRC cells through the lens of pre-cancerous polyps. By using pre-identified gene sets from ADs and SERs, we observed that both MSS and MSI-H CRC cells retained aspects of their respective precursors. Comparing the two subtypes, MSS CRC cells overexpressed a signature of regenerative crypt base stem cells, and MSI-H CRC cells retained a metaplastic signature ( Figures 4 B and 4C; Figure S4 C; Tables S4 and S5 ). These patterns were observed using another scRNA-seq dataset ( Lee et al., 2020 71. Lee, H.-O. ∙ Hong, Y. ∙ Etlioglu, H.E. ... Lineage-dependent gene expression programs influence the immune landscape of colorectal cancer Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :594-603 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 D). To further support commonalities between pre-cancer and cancer, we classified ASCs, SSCs, and CRC cells by consensus molecular subtype (CMS) ( Eide et al., 2017 35. Eide, P.W. ∙ Bruun, J. ∙ Lothe, R.A. ... CMScaller: an R package for consensus molecular subtyping of colorectal cancer pre-clinical models Sci.

Med. 2015; 21 :1350-1356 Crossref Scopus (2041) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 D; Table S4 ). ASCs and MSS CRC cells scored highly for CMS2, the subtype most often associated with WNT pathway dysregulation. In contrast, both SSCs and MSI-H CRC cells scored low for CMS2, but high for CMS1 and CMS3, which feature immunogenic and RAS pathway activation, respectively ( Chi et al., 2009 25.

We also examined the characteristics acquired or lost during the transition from pre-cancer to malignancy. MSI-H CRC cells showed relatively decreased metaplastic and fetal features compared to SSCs. However, key genes within the WNT-activated stem cell program were increased relative to SSCs ( Figure 4 C; Figure S4 C; Tables S4 and S5 ). Supporting reactivation of stemness, CytoTRACE analysis demonstrated MSI-H CRC cells had higher inferred stem potential than SSCs, while scores of MSS CRC cells also were higher than ASCs ( Figure 4 E; Table S4 ). Gene regulatory network analysis more clearly demonstrated how molecular pathways were either maintained or altered during malignant transition, supported through GSEA ( Figures 4 F–4I; Figure S4 E; Table S7 ). Both CRC subtypes activated their proliferative super-regulon compared to polyps, with enrichment of DNA synthesis and repair programs ( Figures 4 F–4I). The WNT signaling super-regulon was consistently upregulated in ASCs and MSS CRC cells ( Figures 4 F and 4G). For MSI-H CRC cells, the super-regulon describing pathogen damage response in SSCs was suppressed, but the WNT signaling super-regulon, previously suppressed in SERs, was activated ( Figures 4 H and 4I). The differences in super-regulon enrichment were maintained in the Broad dataset ( Figure S4 F). Activation of the WNT pathway was supported by acquisition of activating mutations in non-APC WNT pathway components in MSI-H CRCs, including RNF43 (60%), TCF7L2 (53%), ZNRF3 (33%), APC2 (27 %), AXIN2 (20%), FAT1 (33%), FAT2 (47%), and FAT4 (40%) ( Figure S4 A). TCGA WES data also showed enrichment of non-APC WNT pathway gene mutations in MSI-H CRC ( Figure S5 A) ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012 19. Cancer Genome Atlas Network Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer Nature. 2012; 487 :330-337 Crossref Scopus (5208) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results suggest MSI-H CRC acquired metaplasia-independent events by transitioning into more aggressive stem-like cells.
We further queried 63 bulk RNA-seq datasets from the TCGA and validated the association between CMS subtypes and stem/metaplastic signatures ( Figure S5 B). However, the data were noisier than scRNA-seq data on an individual tumor basis, likely due to poor data quality and/or additional intratumoral heterogeneity. This led us to perform spatial profiling using whole slide scanning of entire CRC specimens. Strikingly, none of the MSS CRCs (0/17) stained positive for MUC5AC, but most MSI-H CRCs (13/14) did ( Figures 5 A and 5B). However, the amount of tumor area stained by MUC5AC was variable within the positive MSI-H CRCs. CDX2 staining followed the inverse trend; virtually all tumor cells in MSS CRCs were CDX2 positive, and MSI-H CRCs had variably decreased CDX2 staining. Stem cell markers (OLFM4, SOX9) were expressed throughout MSS CRCs, and they uniformly lacked MUC5AC expression ( Figures 5 C and 5D; Figure S5 C). In contrast, MSI-H CRCs displayed considerable intratumoral MUC5AC heterogeneity, with low staining in certain regions of MSI-H CRCs; these regions were positive for OLFM4 and to some degree CDX2 ( Figures 5 E–5H). SOX9 was generally overexpressed in MSI-H CRCs, suggesting all malignant cells gained some level of stemness ( Figure 5 H). Focused analysis of a single scRNA-seq dataset validated these results. Positive MUC5AC and MSLN expression, coupled to loss of CDX2 expression, distinguished metaplastic cells from LGR5 /β-catenin-expressing proliferative stem cells within the same tumor ( Figures 5 I, 4 C, and 4E). We further confirmed heterogeneity of CDX2 and MUC5AC expression in a CRC tissue microarray using MLH1 staining to infer the microsatellite status of cells ( Figure S5 D). In multiple instances of MSI-H CRCs, we observed intratumoral heterogeneity characterized by mutual exclusivity of stem-like cells and metaplastic cells.
Because SERs did not demonstrate hypermutation and MSI-H CRCs did, we sought to determine whether SERs possess a distinct tumor microenvironment at this early stage. We combined analyses of the non-epithelial scRNA-seq data from pre-cancers and CRCs and identified different cell types based on marker gene expression and their compositional changes between tumor subtypes ( Figures 6 A and 6B; Figures S6 A–S6C). Most immune cell types were increased in polyps compared to normal tissues, including CD4 + T cells, although many were not different between polyp subtypes ( Figure 6 C; Figure S6 D; Tables S3 and S4 ). Strikingly, CD8 + T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γδT cells (labeled cytotoxic cells) were significantly increased in SERs compared to ADs ( Figure 6 C). The overrepresentation of cytotoxic, but not CD4 + T cells, was also observed in MSI-H CRCs compared to MSS CRCs, suggesting a consistent dichotomy in the adaptive microenvironment between subtypes regardless of hypermutation.
Gene signatures related to cytotoxicity and exhaustion within CD8 + T cells did not differ between ADs and SERs, but they were intensified in CD8 + T cells of MSI-H compared to MSS CRC ( Figure S6 E; Tables S4 and S5 ), signifying neoantigen hyper-interaction in the malignant, but not pre-malignant, microenvironment. FOXP3 regulon activity was higher in AD-derived versus normal colonic CD4 + T cells, consistent with a degree of Treg-dependent immunosuppression ( Figure 6 D). ASCs expressed a monocyte-attracting chemokine signature, while SSCs expressed a lymphocyte-attracting cytokine signature important for establishing an adaptive immune environment ( Figure 6 E; Tables S4 and S5 ) ( Hieshima et al., 1997 52. Hieshima, K. ∙ Imai, T. ∙ Opdenakker, G. ... Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC) expressed in liver.

An antigen-processing and presentation gene signature ( Lee et al., 2020 71. Lee, H.-O. ∙ Hong, Y. ∙ Etlioglu, H.E. ...

These data illustrate the persistence of some adaptive immunity regulation mechanisms from pre-cancer to cancer that appear independent of hypermutation.
Multiplex imaging showed that SERs had a higher number of T cells, CD8 + T cells, and a higher ratio of CD8 + to CD4 + T cells compared to ADs ( Figures 6 F and 6G; Figures S6 F and S6G), while other immune cell populations were not significantly different. CD8 + T cells infiltrated into the epithelial compartments of SERs. More CD8 + T cells were observed in ADs with higher mutational loads, although our analysis was underpowered statistically ( Figure S6 H). Myeloid cell abundance was not different by both scRNA-seq and imaging, but CD68 + macrophages were distributed throughout the AD stroma, while they were concentrated at the luminal surfaces of SERs, coinciding with the surface location of MUC5AC + metaplastic cells ( Figure 6 H; Figure S6 I). A similar striking distribution of CD68 + macrophages was reported after fecal transplant and successful immunotherapy response ( Baruch et al., 2021 10. Baruch, E.N. ∙ Youngster, I. ∙ Ben-Betzalel, G. ... Fecal microbiota transplant promotes response in immunotherapy-refractory melanoma patients Science. 2021; 371 :602-609 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), supporting the influence of epithelial-microbial interactions on cytotoxic immune responses. MSI-H CRCs had a heterogeneous distribution of CD8 + T cells mirroring the observed tumor cell heterogeneity. There was a significant enrichment of CD8 + T cells in MUC5AC + metaplastic regions and reduced numbers in OLFM4 + stem-like regions ( Figure 6 I; Figures S6 J–S6L). In contrast, MSS CRCs had fewer T cells throughout the tumors, which were homogeneously composed of OLFM4 + stem-like cells ( Figure 6 I; Figures S6 J–S6L). These results strengthen the association between the metaplastic origin of SERs and the cytotoxic immune microenvironment and implicate immune suppression as tumor cells gain stemness.
To determine whether the cytotoxic response in serrated tumorigenesis is intrinsic to tumor cell state prior to hypermutation, we used genetically engineered mice that model the earliest tumorigenic events. The Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Apc 2lox14/+ is a model of the AD pathway, resulting in adenomatous tumors in the distal colon ( Powell et al., 2012 101. Powell, A.E. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... The pan-ErbB negative regulator Lrig1 is an intestinal stem cell marker that functions as a tumor suppressor Cell. 2012; 149 :146-158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ). Driving a Braf -activating mutation ( Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Braf LSL-V600E/+ ) did not result in macroscopic tumors but induced villiform metaplasias in the proximal colon ( Figure 7 A). Apc mutant tumors had elevated β-catenin staining and a reduced number of CD8 + T cells compared to control normal colon, consistent with human ADs and MSS CRCs. In contrast, Braf mutant lesions were associated with increased CD8 + T cell infiltration, strikingly, only in the differentiated cell compartment and not in mutant crypts ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Similar results were observed in a parallel Kras -activating mouse model ( Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Kras LSL-G12D/+ ) ( Figures S7 A–S7C). Thus, mutant differentiated cells in lesions, but not stem cells, drive the cytotoxic immune microenvironment.
To determine how a differentiated cell versus stem cell state influences the immune microenvironment, we normalized the genetic event by driving the same Apc mutation from stem ( Lrig1 CreERT2 ) versus non-stem ( Mist1 CreERT2 ) cells. While Lrig1 + cells are bona fide stem cells ( Powell et al., 2012 101. Powell, A.E. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... The pan-ErbB negative regulator Lrig1 is an intestinal stem cell marker that functions as a tumor suppressor Cell. 2012; 149 :146-158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ), lineage-tracing studies showed Mist1 + cells are non-stem cells in the proximal colon under both homeostasis and DSS-induced damage ( Figures S7 D–S7F). Using immunostaining and transcriptomics, we determined Mist1 + cells represent a subset of committed (goblet/enteroendocrine) cells outside the colonic crypt base ( Figures S7 G–S7K).
Importantly, Mist1 + cells initiated colonic tumors (abbreviated as Mist1 tumors) with biallelic recombination of Apc ( Mist1 CreERT2/+ ; Apc 2lox14/2lox14 ) followed by 2.5% DSS damage, representing a non-stem-driven tumor model. At most, one or two Mist1 tumors developed per mouse in the proximal versus distal colon by a 7:1 ratio ( Figures 7 D and 7E; Figures S7 L and S7M), which differs from the distal colon predominance of tumors in the Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ; Apc 2lox14/+ model ( Powell et al., 2012 101. Powell, A.E. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... The pan-ErbB negative regulator Lrig1 is an intestinal stem cell marker that functions as a tumor suppressor Cell. 2012; 149 :146-158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ). We developed a stem cell-driven tumor model (abbreviated as Lrig1 tumors) for comparison, using Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ; Apc 2lox14/2lox14 mice and focal Cre activation, followed by DSS. Blinded histological assessment revealed that Lrig1 tumors were high-grade dysplastic tumors, but Mist1 tumors were low grade ( Figure S7 N). To decipher the molecular landscape of the two tumor types, we performed scRNA-seq on tumor tissues along with control colons and identified cells specific to tumors, including abnormal Paneth cells ( Figures 7 F–7H; Figure S7 O). Due to a common WNT-driven mutational process, tumor-specific cells (TSCs) from both tumor types formed an Lgr5 -overexpressing cell population without a metaplastic gene signature ( Figures 7 G–7I). Moreover, both tumor types exhibited elevated β-catenin staining reflecting WNT activation ( Figure 7 E; Figure S7 M).
While the mutational processes between the tumor types were identical, we revealed marked differences in the immune microenvironments. Mist1 tumors, similar to SERs, harbored higher proportions of CD8 + T cells ( Figures 7 J–7M; Figures S7 P and S7Q). These cells expressed markers of active cytotoxicity and killing effectors ( Figure 7 N; Figure S7 Q; Table S5 ). Lrig1 tumors possessed a distinct population of dysfunctional CD4 + T cells that may have transitioned into anergy or exhaustion ( Figures 7 J–7M; Figure S7 P). These cells expressed immunosuppressive markers, such as Pdcd1 (PD1), Ctla4 , Prdm1 , and Havcr2 (TIM3), as well as genes of the Foxp3 regulon, implicating dysfunctional T cells exhibiting regulatory characteristics ( Figure 7 N; Figure S7 Q; Table S5 ). Strikingly, Lrig1 tumors, but not Mist1 tumors, had a large infiltration of myeloid cells that include tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid derived suppressive-like cells, and distinct neutrophils expressing Cd274 (PDL1) ( Figures 7 J–7N; Figures S7 P and S7Q; Table S5 ). Multiplex imaging showed a significantly higher number of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells but not CD4 + T cells in Mist1 tumors compared to Lrig1 tumors ( Figures 7 O and 7P; Figures S7 R and S7S). In separate mouse models with identical Apc mutations, tumors originating from differentiated cells promote a cytotoxic microenvironment, while tumors driven by stem cells associate with a suppressive immune microenvironment.
To relate epithelial stemness to microenvironmental differences, we applied CytoTRACE to show that Lrig1 TSCs had significantly higher inferred stem potential, and expressed more stem and less differentiated cell genes than Mist1 TSCs ( Figure 7 Q; Figure S7 T). In turn, Lrig1 tumor cells were significantly more successful in forming organoids than Mist1 tumor cells ( Figure 7 R). Gleaning from previous work defining a gradient of stemness (ISCI > ISCII > ISCIII) in normal intestinal stem cells associated with immune cell interactions ( Biton et al., 2018 13. Biton, M. ∙ Haber, A.L. ∙ Rogel, N. ... T Helper Cell Cytokines Modulate Intestinal Stem Cell Renewal and Differentiation Cell. 2018; 175 :1307-1320 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found Lrig1 TSCs exhibited a higher ISCI score while Mist1 TSCs exhibited higher ISCII and ISCIII scores ( Figure 7 S). Consistent with ISCII's and ISCIII’s increased antigen-presentation capacities, Mist1 TSCs also had increased expression of antigen-presentation machinery ( Figures 7 T and 7U). Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Braf LSL-V600E/+ villiform metaplasias also exhibited increased epithelial expression of antigen-presentation machinery compared to Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Apc 2lox14/+ tumors, but only in the differentiated and not in the stem compartment ( Figure S7 U). GSEA demonstrated Mist1 TSCs were significantly enriched for genes associated with immune-mediated processes, with antigen presentation being the most significant ( Figure S7 V). These results demonstrate how the degree of stemness within neoplastic compartments, as dictated by cellular origins, is linked to the tumor immune microenvironment.
To validate expression of antigen-presentation machinery actually reflects function, we assayed for antigen processing and presentation in Lrig1 and Mist1 tumor-derived tumoroids using the class 2 antigen ovalbumin (OVA). Mist1 tumoroids processed and presented more antigen than Lrig1 tumoroids, reflected by endocytosis and proteolysis of DQ-OVA coupled to I-A/I-E staining indicating surface antigen presentation ( Figure 7 V; Figure S7 W). In support of this observation, Mist1 tumoroids had an increased ability to stimulate T cell proliferation upon presentation of OVA peptide compared to Lrig1 tumoroids ( Figure 7 W; Figure S7 X); suppression of this effect was observed in Lrig1 tumoroids compared to normal distal colonoids. Human tumoroid assays revealed a decrease in stem capacity alongside an increased antigen-presentation gene signature in human SERs compared to ADs ( Figure S7 Y; Figure 6 E). Between tumors, cytotoxic cell infiltration positively correlated with metaplastic signatures in SERs ( Figure S7 Z). Differentiation media, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (representative of type 1 immune environment found in SERs), or the two combined were used to induce human AD tumoroids. All three conditions increased expression of antigen-presentation machinery, although the effect of IFN-γ was greater ( Figure S7 A′). In the human colon epithelium, expression of the antigen-presentation machinery was inversely proportional to stemness ( Figure S7 B′; Tables S4 and S5 ). Our data implicate how stemness influence antigen-presentation ability, which may partly underlie the differential stimulation of a cytotoxic immune response.

Section: Discussion

By definition, metaplasia is a process by which differentiated cells transition into cell types non-native to the tissue. Metaplasia often arises in response to damage of the epithelium, which activates a regenerative program to direct the conversion to reparative mucous-secreting lineages resembling those of pyloric glands ( Goldenring, 2018 43. Goldenring, J.R. Pyloric metaplasia, pseudopyloric metaplasia, ulcer-associated cell lineage and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia: reparative lineages in the gastrointestinal mucosa J. Pathol. 2018; 245 :132-137 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Metaplastic programs have been observed in other organs of the GI tract ( Goldenring and Mills, 2021 44. Goldenring, J.R. ∙ Mills, J.C. Cellular Plasticity, Reprogramming, and Regeneration: Metaplasia in the Stomach and Beyond Gastroenterology. 2021; S0016-5085(21)03708-2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ). In SERs, we observed misexpression of genes found in the gastric pylorus, reversion to a fetal gene program, and loss of regional identity with reduced CDX2 expression. It is important to distinguish metaplastic transitions from dedifferentiation of committed cells into stem cells ( Buczacki et al., 2013 17. Buczacki, S.J.A. ∙ Zecchini, H.I. ∙ Nicholson, A.M. ...

We propose a new paradigm in which damage to the proximal colon, possibly from microbiota, initiates a metaplastic cascade that may eventually select for survival/proliferative pathways, such as activating BRAF mutations. Reversion to a fetal developmental identity is a feature of WNT-independent tumorigenesis found in recent mouse models ( Han et al., 2020 48. Han, T. ∙ Goswami, S. ∙ Hu, Y. ... Lineage reversion drives wnt independence in intestinal cancer Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :1590-1609 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which can be triggered by MAPK activation either via Braf -activating mutations, epithelial damage response, or stress triggered by mismatch repair deficiency ( Bommi et al., 2021 15. Bommi, P.V. ∙ Bowen, C.M. ∙ Reyes-Uribe, L. ...

Commun. 2021; 12 :3464 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Critically, Braf mutations in mouse models must be accompanied by a “second hit,” such as perturbation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, for tumor induction ( Han et al., 2020 48.

Degree of Tissue Differentiation Dictates Susceptibility to BRAF-Driven Colorectal Cancer Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3833-3845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). This “second hit” may be provided by microenvironmental signals.
Methylation of the CDX2 locus has been frequently observed in serrated tumors, potentially leading to its downregulation, and loss of Cdx2 can provide the “second hit” in a serrated tumorigenesis model ( Tong et al., 2017 120. Tong, K. ∙ Pellón-Cárdenas, O. ∙ Sirihorachai, V.R. ... Degree of Tissue Differentiation Dictates Susceptibility to BRAF-Driven Colorectal Cancer Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3833-3845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Increased methylation has been found to be dependent on extrinsic factors such as aging ( Tao et al., 2019 115. Tao, Y. ∙ Kang, B. ∙ Petkovich, D.A. ... Aging-like Spontaneous Epigenetic Silencing Facilitates Wnt Activation, Stemness, and Braf V600E -Induced Tumorigenesis Cancer Cell. 2019; 35 :315-328.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with the preponderance of BRAF V600E mutations in MSI-H CRCs in older individuals ( Lieu et al., 2019 77. Lieu, C.H. ∙ Golemis, E.A. ∙ Serebriiskii, I.G. ... Comprehensive genomic landscapes in early and later onset colorectal cancer Clin. Cancer Res. 2019; 25 :5852-5858 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Shown more recently, microbial dysbiosis can also be an environmental trigger for hypermethylation ( DeStefano Shields et al., 2021 31. DeStefano Shields, C.E. ∙ White, J.R. ∙ Chung, L. ... Bacterial-driven inflammation and mutant braf expression combine to promote murine colon tumorigenesis that is sensitive to immune checkpoint therapy Cancer Discov. 2021; 11 :1792-1807 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antibiotic suppression of the microbiota reduces colonic tumorigenesis in a Braf mutant model ( Leach et al., 2021 70. Leach, J.D.G. ∙ Vlahov, N. ∙ Tsantoulis, P. ..., S:CORT consortium Oncogenic BRAF, unrestrained by TGFβ-receptor signalling, drives right-sided colonic tumorigenesis Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :3464 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas in another study, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) infection is a required trigger for tumorigenesis in the proximal mid-colon in a Braf mutant mouse model ( DeStefano Shields et al., 2021 31. DeStefano Shields, C.E. ∙ White, J.R. ∙ Chung, L. ... Bacterial-driven inflammation and mutant braf expression combine to promote murine colon tumorigenesis that is sensitive to immune checkpoint therapy Cancer Discov. 2021; 11 :1792-1807 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the latter report, the earliest events of the ETBF response in epithelial cells prior to tumor formation occur at the colonic mucosal surface, where colonic epithelial cells and luminal contents interact. The importance of the microbiota to this type of tumorigenesis is underscored by the co-occurrence of polymicrobial biofilms in ∼90% of right-sided CRCs, which are enriched for serrated tumors, versus ∼12% biofilm-positive left-sided CRCs ( Dejea et al., 2014 30. Dejea, C.M. ∙ Wick, E.C. ∙ Hechenbleikner, E.M. ... Microbiota organization is a distinct feature of proximal colorectal cancers Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :18321-18326 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ). Considering the crypt-to-lumen vertical axis of the colonic mucosa, differentiated cells at the luminal surface are exposed to the microbiota, are more susceptible to damage, and utilize repair mechanisms reliant on cellular plasticity. Conversely, stem cells residing in the crypt base are more protected from luminal stressors ( Kaiko et al., 2016 59. Kaiko, G.E. ∙ Ryu, S.H. ∙ Koues, O.I. ... The Colonic Crypt Protects Stem Cells from Microbiota-Derived Metabolites Cell. 2016; 165 :1708-1720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculate that adenomatous and serrated tumorigenesis originate from fundamentally different mechanisms: the former from DNA replication-induced mutations in continually renewing stem cells and the latter from damage and repair at the colonic surface triggered and maintained by foreign stressors in the luminal environment. Distinct origins of neoplastic cells then select for different mutational pathways required for tumorigenesis.
Several of our findings have clinical value. SSLs can be challenging to identify as the diagnosis is based on the presence of a single “architecturally distorted serrated crypt” as defined by the recently revised WHO classification ( Kim and Kang, 2020 60. Kim, J.H. ∙ Kang, G.H. Evolving pathologic concepts of serrated lesions of the colorectum J. Pathol. Transl. Med. 2020; 54 :276-289 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results suggest biomarkers, such as MUC5AC staining coupled to the absence of CDX2, may confirm the diagnosis of lesions suspicious for SSLs. In addition, the cytotoxic immune response in SSLs precedes hypermutation in human tumors, which is consistent with recent mouse modeling showing the same order of events ( DeStefano Shields et al., 2021 31. DeStefano Shields, C.E. ∙ White, J.R. ∙ Chung, L. ... Bacterial-driven inflammation and mutant braf expression combine to promote murine colon tumorigenesis that is sensitive to immune checkpoint therapy Cancer Discov. 2021; 11 :1792-1807 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hypermutation is a characteristic of MSI-H CRCs, and the resulting high neoantigen load is thought to be the critical driver of the cytotoxic microenvironment. What then drives the cytotoxic immune response without hypermutation? Our data implicate that tumor cells with a differentiated state, by virtue of their previous exposure to the luminal microenvironment, are more adept at antigen presentation and setting up an active immune environment. Differentiated goblet cells that potentially develop from Mist1 + precursors have shown capacity for luminal antigen passage ( Knoop et al., 2015 62. Knoop, K.A. ∙ McDonald, K.G. ∙ McCrate, S. ... Microbial sensing by goblet cells controls immune surveillance of luminal antigens in the colon Mucosal Immunol. 2015; 8 :198-210 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). How tumor cells with a differentiated phenotype acquire and maintain immuno-stimulating properties remains to be determined. In contrast, acquisition of stem cell characteristics by MSI-H CRCs contributes to spatial intratumoral heterogeneity: metaplastic compartments retain their association with cytotoxic immune cells, and stem cell compartments become associated with immunosuppressive cells and signals. In addition to mutations, transition to stemness can also be modulated by recruitment of fibroblasts that express stem cell niche factors ( Pelka et al., 2021 98. Pelka, K. ∙ Hofree, M. ∙ Chen, J.H. ... Spatially organized multicellular immune hubs in human colorectal cancer Cell. 2021; 184 :4734-4752.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Colon cancer stem-like cells have been shown to downregulate their antigen-presentation machinery ( Tallerico et al., 2013 114. Tallerico, R. ∙ Todaro, M. ∙ Di Franco, S. ...

Cancer-initiating cells from colorectal cancer patients escape from T cell-mediated immunosurveillance in vitro through membrane-bound IL-4 J. Immunol. 2014; 192 :523-532 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The degree to which MSI-H CRCs acquire stem-like properties is variable; future studies will be needed to determine whether acquisition of stemness in these cancers impacts the likelihood of an immunotherapeutic response. The top-down spatial organization, differentiated and metaplastic transcriptional program, and cytotoxic immune environment associated with SSLs may open novel strategies for interception of cancer progression, including better informed interval guidelines for surveillance, chemoprevention, or pre- and pro-biotic therapies.

Section: Limitations of the study

Since our study profiled largely small polyps, the material for multi-omic analyses was limiting, as seen from our inability to obtain high-quality DNA from a number of samples. Enriching for specific cell populations was not performed due to potential material loss, which contributed to the heavy epithelial representation in our scRNA-seq data, and non-comprehensive characterization of some non-epithelial cell populations. Longitudinal analysis of polyps was not possible due to complete colonoscopic removal of polyps identified. Finally, while we performed functional validation experiments in vitro and in vivo , the exact molecular pathway(s) by which tumor cells maintain the characteristics of their origins and when the immune system engages tumor neoantigens remain undefined.

COLON MAP participants were recruited from adults undergoing routine screening or surveillance colonoscopy or surgery for resection of a polyp at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN, USA that began in March 2019 and is still on-going, participant characteristics are shown in Table S2 . The participants included in this study are the first 56 participants from COLON MAP with polyps collected for analysis by scRNA-seq. All participants provided written informed consent approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
Eligibility criteria for COLON MAP include ability to provide informed consent, free-living (not a resident of an institution), ability to speak and understand English, aged 40 to 75 years, permanent residence or telephone, and no personal confirmed or suspected histories of hereditary polyposis syndromes, familial or genetic colorectal cancer syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, colon resection or colectomy, cancer, neoadjuvant therapy, or cystic fibrosis. Eligible individuals were first identified from the schedule within the electronic health record (EHR) and assigned a random number. Potential participants undergoing colonoscopy were further selected using a stratified weighted random sampling design to increase the inclusion of non-White or Latinx participants in the study. Within strata of colonoscopy appointment day and time, random sampling was weighted by EHR-derived racial/ethnic category (White non-Latinx versus all other races and ethnicities) such that non-White or Latinx patients were first selected at random within colonoscopy day and time. White, non-Latinx patients were then selected at random within remaining time slots.
Following selection, study staff conducted a manual review of the EHR to confirm study eligibility. The majority of eligible individuals were mailed a letter to introduce the study and a few days later were attempted to be reached by telephone to discuss their willingness to participate in the study. Individuals who were willing to participate completed an additional screening form to confirm eligibility, and eligible and willing individuals completed an interviewer-administered, computer-assisted telephone interview to solicit information on personal health history, family history of cancer and polyps, lifestyle factors, and other risk factors for colorectal polyps and cancer. When the schedule of the study staff would allow, individuals who were not reached by telephone were approached in the colonoscopy waiting room or at the surgical appointment to determine eligibility and willingness as well as some individuals who did not receive a mailing.
For histopathological diagnosis, standard clinical histology was performed. Information on the colonoscopy or surgery and diagnosis was initially abstracted from the EHR colonoscopy, surgery, and pathology reports by study staff including in vivo size and polyp location. Two study pathologists additionally reviewed each case to standardize diagnoses and identify HP subtypes which are not part of routine clinical practice. For polyps which were partial due to the sampling for this study, the portion which had been reserved for clinical diagnosis was reviewed. SSLs were defined using the World Health Organization criteria of at least one distorted, dilated, or horizontally branched crypt within the polyp ( Rex et al., 2012 103. Rex, D.K. ∙ Ahnen, D.J. ∙ Baron, J.A. ... Serrated lesions of the colorectum: review and recommendations from an expert panel Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2012; 107 :1315-1329 Crossref Scopus (742) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subtypes of ADs were identified using standard diagnostic criteria based on the villous component (tubular (< 25% villous component), tubulovillous (25%–74% villous component), and villous (≥75%)). HPs were classified as microvesicular HP or goblet cell HP ( Leggett and Whitehall, 2010 73. Leggett, B. ∙ Whitehall, V. Role of the serrated pathway in colorectal cancer pathogenesis Gastroenterology. 2010; 138 :2088-2100 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (659) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this analysis, participants were classified based upon the diagnosis of their index polyps but may have had synchronous polyps with the same or different histopathologies as shown in Table S1 .
Tissue was collected for COLON MAP from 33 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients via the CHTN Western Division. These participants were aged between 21 and 82 years of age from both sexes (51.5% male, 48.5% female) and were white (75.8%), Black (21.2%), or Asian (3.0%). De-identified clinical metadata from each patient was extracted from clinical pathology reports in accordance with policies from CHTN. Tumors were classified by grade and staging, ranging from G1 to G3 and I to IV, respectively. The majority (75.6%) of the tumors were classified as G2, or moderately differentiated, and staged primarily as IIA (30.3%) and IIIB (33.3%). Additionally, 51.5% were microsatellite stable (MSS) and 49.5% were microsatellite-high (MSI-H). Participant characteristics of the 33 CRC patients obtained from the CHTN Western Division are shown in Table S7 .
A colorectal carcinoma progression tissue microarray (TMA) was also provided by the CHTN Mid-Atlantic Division which included cores from 54 individuals. The mean (standard deviation) age of the individuals included on the TMA was 56.9 (14.7), 56.9% were men, and 43.1% were women. Race and ethnicity were not provided. Information on the TMA is available at https://chtn.sites.virginia.edu/chtn-crc2
The TCPS was a large colonoscopy-based case-control study among individuals undergoing colonoscopy in Nashville, Tennessee, USA between February 2003 and October 2010. Institutional approval for human subjects research was provided by the VUMC and VA Institutional Review Boards and the VA Research and Development Committee. TCPS participants were aged between 40 to 75 years of age and had no personal history of colon resection, cancer, polyposis syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes, or previous adenoma. In TCPS, the diagnostic criteria for polyps were identical to the criteria used for COLON MAP. Additionally, all polyps were reviewed by one of the COLON MAP pathologists. Features of these archived participants and polyps included are shown in Table S2 .
Detailed methods have been previously published ( Davenport et al., 2018 28. Davenport, J.R. ∙ Su, T. ∙ Zhao, Z. ... Modifiable lifestyle factors associated with risk of sessile serrated polyps, conventional adenomas and hyperplastic polyps Gut. 2018; 67 :456-465 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this analysis, a subset of TCPS formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded polyps which were previously analyzed by bulk RNA-seq were included to validate findings from the COLON MAP scRNA-seq analysis. In addition, a subset of fresh frozen polyps which were selected for targeted gene sequencing were also included.
All animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Vanderbilt University Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with NIH guidelines. Mice were 8 weeks old at the start of experiments and were humanely euthanized at the end of experiments according to approved guidelines. Animal weights were recorded at initiation of experiment and at the time of euthanasia. All animals used in this study were predominantly of the C57BL/6J background and both sexes were used. Littermate controls were used for experiments when possible. All animals were housed 2 to 5 per cage in a controlled environment in standard bedding with a standard 12-hour daylight cycle, cessation of light at 6 PM, and free access to standard chow diet and water. Experiments were conducted during the light cycle, excluding continuous dietary interventions.
Polyps were dissociated and washed as described in the COLON MAP scRNA-seq, Encapsulation and Library Generation section. After dissociation, cells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (STEMCELL Technologies) and pelleted by quick-pulse centrifugation for 7 s. Human organoid models were generated from COLON MAP individuals of both sexes (70% female, 30% male). Polyp-derived cells were grown with Human IntestiCult organoid growth media (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632, 10 nM Gastrin I (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), 500 nM A83-01 (Tocris), 50 ng/mL FGF-2 (Thermo Fisher), 100 ng/mL IGF-1 (BioLegend), 100 μg/mL Primocin (InvivoGen), and Matrigel (Corning) in a 3:1 ratio of Matrigel to media. Media was replaced every 2-3 days, and passaging was performed by dissociating the organoids in TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher) with 10 μM Y-27632 for 15 minutes at 37°C while shaking and triturating.
Mouse organoids were generated from the same pool of mice used in mouse model experiments, with both sexes being used. Mouse tumors were dissociated using TrypLE Express, and cell pellets were resuspended in Matrigel and seeded in 25 μL droplets in a 24-well or 12-well plate. Once solidified, samples were incubated in 1 mL Mouse IntestiCult culture medium (STEMCELL Technologies) with 100 μg/mL Primocin for 5 days. Fresh media was replaced on day 3. Passaging was performed similarly to human organoids.
Prior to the procedure, an oral mouthwash rinse sample was collected from participants. Blood was also collected through the IV line, prior to colonoscopy, in EDTA and serum tubes. The EDTA and serum samples were spun at 1,500 g for 10 minutes, using a refrigerated centrifuge (at 4°C). The plasma was pipetted into four sterile 2ml cryovials, white blood cells were aliquoted into two 2ml vials, and red blood cells were stored in two 2ml vials after being washed two times with cold saline solution. Serum was pipetted into four 2ml vials and the blood clot into two 2ml vials. The mouth rinse samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were suspended using TE buffer, then aliquoted into a 2ml vial. All samples were placed into −80°C freezers for storage until use.
During the colonoscopy, the gastroenterologist used biopsy forceps to collect normal appearing mucosa samples from the ascending and descending colon for all participants. One of the biopsies from each colon segment was placed into RPMI. Any polyps were removed during the colonoscopy per standard clinical practice. In this analysis, the first polyp which was removed from a participant that was larger than 0.5 cm was selected for scRNA-seq analysis (index polyp). Polyps which were removed intact were bisected along the vertical axis using a sterile razor blade and half was placed in RPMI. For polyps which were removed piecemeal, the second largest piece was placed in RPMI. The other portions of the polyps were placed into formalin for diagnosis and fixed and processed using standard clinical practice in the Vanderbilt Pathology Laboratory. All polyps which were placed in RPMI were immediately transported to the research lab for use in scRNA-seq analysis.
For germline, DNA was isolated from thawed buffy coat or mouth rinse samples using a QIAmp DNA kit (QIAGEN). For tumors, DNA for whole exome sequencing (WES) was purified with the truXTRAC FFPE microTUBE DNA Kit-Column Purification kit (Covaris). In brief, tumor tissues were scraped from 1-5 of 10 μm FFPE sections, deparaffinized using xylene, and lysed in an optimized lysis buffer that contains proteinase K. Following the proteinase K digestion to release DNA from the tissue, a higher temperature was used incubation to reverse formalin crosslinking alongside RNase treatment using RNase A (Thermo Fisher). The DNA and RNA samples were stored at −80°C before being used for assays.
Standard WES was performed on S4 flow cells on NovaSeq6000 (PE150) to the targeted coverage. WES reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 using BWA ( Li and Durbin, 2009 75. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (22130) PubMed Google Scholar ), sorted and indexed by Sambamba ( Tarasov et al., 2015 116. Tarasov, A. ∙ Vilella, A.J. ∙ Cuppen, E. ... Sambamba: fast processing of NGS alignment formats Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :2032-2034 Crossref Scopus (465) PubMed Google Scholar ). Duplicated reads were removed by the mark duplicates function with Picard. Somatic mutations were called using sequenced DNA extracted from specimens detailed in the COLON MAP Biological Specimen Collection and Processing, Blood and Oral Rinse section. These somatic mutations were then called using GATK4 Mutect2 in “normal-tumor” paired mode ( Van der Auwera et al., 2013 126. Van der Auwera, G.A. ∙ Carneiro, M.O. ∙ Hartl, C. ...

Colonic biopsy samples were first placed into RPMI solution, minced to approximately 4mm 2 , and washed with 1x DPBS. These samples were then incubated in chelation buffer (4mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT) at 4 °C for 1 h 15 min. Then, the resulting tissue suspension was dissociated with cold protease and DNase I for 25 minutes ( Banerjee et al., 2020 8. Banerjee, A. ∙ Herring, C.A. ∙ Chen, B. ...

Liu, Q. ∙ Herring, C.A. ∙ Sheng, Q. ... Quantitative assessment of cell population diversity in single-cell landscapes PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 :e2006687 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suspension was titurated throughout the process, every 10 minutes, then washed three times with 1x DPBS before encapsulation. Cells were encapsulated using a modified inDrop platform ( Klein et al., 2015 61. Klein, A.M. ∙ Mazutis, L. ∙ Akartuna, I. ... Droplet barcoding for single-cell transcriptomics applied to embryonic stem cells Cell. 2015; 161 :1187-1201 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1493) PubMed Google Scholar ), and sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruDrop protocol ( Southard-Smith et al., 2020 111. Southard-Smith, A.N. ∙ Simmons, A.J. ∙ Chen, B. ... Dual indexed library design enables compatibility of in-Drop single-cell RNA-sequencing with exAMP chemistry sequencing platforms BMC Genomics. 2020; 21 :456 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Libraries were sequenced in a S4 flow cell using a PE150 kit on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 to a target of 150 million reads.
We demultiplexed, aligned, and corrected the detected read counts of these libraries with the DropEst pipeline ( Petukhov et al., 2018 99. Petukhov, V. ∙ Guo, J. ∙ Baryawno, N. ... dropEst: pipeline for accurate estimation of molecular counts in droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq experiments Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :78 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the STAR aligner with the Ensembl reference genome ( Dobin et al., 2013 32. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (13688) PubMed Google Scholar ), GRCh38 release 25. This was paired with the corresponding GTF annotations. The protocol for running this pipeline is described by ( Chen et al., 2021 24. Chen, B. ∙ Ramirez-Solano, M.A. ∙ Heiser, C.N. ... Processing single-cell RNA-seq data for dimension reduction-based analyses using open-source tools STAR Protoc. 2021; 2 :100450 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We identified high-quality, cell-containing droplets and their respective barcodes through the joint application of cumulative sum inflection point thresholding, our dropkick QC algorithm ( Heiser et al., 2021 50. Heiser, C.N. ∙ Wang, V.M. ∙ Chen, B. ... Automated quality control and cell identification of droplet-based single-cell data using dropkick Genome Res. 2021; 31 :1742-1752 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ), and prior-knowledge gene expression profiling. This droplet matrix was processed as an AnnData object using our preprocessing pipeline which utilizes the Scanpy toolkit ( Wolf et al., 2018 135. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, we ran dropkick with 5-fold cross validation on the unprocessed droplet matrix, which assigned each barcode a probability of being a high-quality cell. Second, the droplet matrix was preprocessed for low dimensional analysis through finding the inflection point of the cumulative sum curve, and droplets with low information content were removed. Third, the remaining cells were normalized to the median number of counts per single-cell library per dataset, inverse hyperbolic sine transformed, and then scaled as a Z-score. Fourth, normalized matrices were projected into 2 dimensions by using its 50 principal component decomposition to initialize a UMAP ( McInnes et al., 2018 86. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Saul, N. ... UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection J. Open Source Softw. 2018; 3 :861 Crossref Google Scholar ). Fifth, gene expression and dropkick probability scores were overlaid and checked for consistency. The genes overlaid were based on prior knowledge of the colonic epithelial markers, deferring to dropkick scores when no markers were found. Sixth, the selection of the final set of high-quality cell-containing droplets were determined by setting a binarization threshold on the dropkick probability scores, given concordance to marker gene expression and other general quality metrics such as total counts, mitochondrial count percentage, and transcriptional diversity. The full protocol for running this QC pipeline is described by ( Chen et al., 2021 24. Chen, B. ∙ Ramirez-Solano, M.A. ∙ Heiser, C.N. ... Processing single-cell RNA-seq data for dimension reduction-based analyses using open-source tools STAR Protoc. 2021; 2 :100450 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Fresh frozen samples were stored in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Fisher Scientific) compound until ready for processing. These samples were washed in cold 1x PBS followed by centrifugation before using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits (QIAGEN) for DNA extraction. All following processing was performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The DNA extract collected from these samples were sequenced and aligned as detailed in the COLON MAP Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Alignment section.
MxIHC was performed by iterative antibody staining and chromogen removal based on the protocol in ( Tsujikawa et al., 2017 123. Tsujikawa, T. ∙ Kumar, S. ∙ Borkar, R.N. ... Quantitative Multiplex Immunohistochemistry Reveals Myeloid-Inflamed Tumor-Immune Complexity Associated with Poor Prognosis Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :203-217 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chromogen was removed between sequential rounds through sequential alcohol baths, and antibody was stripped by high temperature (95°C for 15 minutes). Single antibody stains using 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine were performed using standard protocols. Incubation and detection conditions are listed in the methods github repository:
https://github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/STAR_Methods/blob/main/Methods_Tables.xlsx (Methods Table 1)
Cyclical antibody staining, detection, and dye inactivation was performed as described previously by ( Gerdes et al., 2013 42. Gerdes, M.J. ∙ Sevinsky, C.J. ∙ Sood, A. ... Highly multiplexed single-cell analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cancer tissue Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11982-11987 Crossref Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, fluorescence imaging was performed on a GE IN Cell Analyzer 2500 using the Cell DIVE platform. Images were acquired at x200 magnification with exposure times determined for each antibody. Antibody reagents are listed in the Key Resources Table . Staining sequence, conditions, and exposure times are listed in tables found in the methods github repository: https://github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/STAR_Methods/blob/main/Methods_Tables.xlsx (Methods Table 2). For each round of staining, DAPI images were aligned using rigid transformations to the first imaging round. The registered images were corrected for uneven illumination and autofluorescence was removed for each channel.
DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue sections using QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (QIAGEN), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tumor tissues were scraped from 1-5 of 10 μm FFPE sections, deparaffinized using xylene, and lysed under denaturing conditions with proteinase K. The sample lysate was incubated at 90°C to reverses formalin crosslinking and then applied to a QIAamp MinElute spin column, where DNA was captured on a silica membrane. The genomic DNA was then washed and eluted from the membrane.
DNA and total RNA were extracted from fresh frozen polyps and purified using QIAGEN’s AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (QIAGEN), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the frozen tissue samples were first disrupted and homogenized using Lysing Matrix E (MP Bio) by shaking the tubes on a bead-beater at 5.5 m/sec for 30 s. The lysate was then passed through an AllPrep DNA Mini spin column. This column allows selective and efficient binding of genomic DNA. Following on-column Proteinase K digestion, the column was then washed and pure, ready-to-use DNA was eluted. Flow-through from the DNA Mini spin column was then digested by Proteinase K in the presence of ethanol and applied to the RNeasy Mini spin column, where the total RNA binds to the membrane. Following DNase I digestion, contaminants were efficiently washed away and high-quality RNA was eluted in RNase-free water. The quantity and quality of the DNA/RNA samples were checked by Nanodrop (E260/E280 and E260/E230 ratio) and by separation on an Agilent BioAnalyzer.
The list of candidate genes included in the targeted sequencing was developed from a literature review of candidate mutations which showed 1) evidence that mutation is common in adenoma (> 5% of adenomas), 2) evidence that the mutation is associated with or predictive of adenoma recurrence in previous studies, 3) evidence that mutation is associated with clinically more significant adenoma (i.e., advanced adenoma or multiplicity), 4) evidence that mutation is associated with colorectal field carcinogenesis, and 5) evidence that mutation is associated with colorectal cancer aggressiveness and survival. In addition, additional candidate mutations were identified from potential mutations observed in Lrig1-Cre:Apc adenomas. All primer development and next-generation sequencing were conducted by Covance. Sequencing depth was 500X. Targeted sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 using BWA ( Li and Durbin, 2009 75. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (22130) PubMed Google Scholar ),and then were sorted and indexed by Sambamba ( Tarasov et al., 2015 116. Tarasov, A. ∙ Vilella, A.J. ∙ Cuppen, E. ... Sambamba: fast processing of NGS alignment formats Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :2032-2034 Crossref Scopus (465) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignments were further refined, and variants were called using GATK Best Practices tools ( Van der Auwera et al., 2013 126. Van der Auwera, G.A. ∙ Carneiro, M.O. ∙ Hartl, C. ... From FastQ data to high confidence variant calls: the Genome Analysis Toolkit best practices pipeline Curr. Protoc. Bioinforma. 2013; 43 :11.10.1-11.10.33 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), including mark duplicates with Picard, base quality-score recalibration, and variant calling with HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs ( Poplin et al., 2017 100. Poplin, R. ∙ Ruano-Rubio, V. ∙ DePristo, M.A. ... Scaling accurate genetic variant discovery to tens of thousands of samples BioRxiv. 2017; Google Scholar ). SNPs were filtered using GATK VariantFiltration function with the parameters “QD < 2.0 || Qual < 30.0 || FS > 60.0 || SOR>3.0 || MQ < 40.0 || MQRankSum < −12.5 || ReadPosRankSum < −8.0,” while indels were filtered with the parameters “QD < 2.0 || Qual < 30.0 || FS > 200.0 || ReadPosRankSum < −20.0.” The variants with a minor allele frequency > 0.1% in ExAC, gnomAD, TOPMed or 1000 Genomes were also removed. The functional effects of variants were annotated by ANNOVAR ( Wang et al., 2010 133. Wang, K. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Hakonarson, H.

Bulk RNA-sequencing was performed by Aros Applied Biotechnology A/S. This process involves the initial QC on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, with a minimum quality threshold of the DV 200 at 30%. Total RNA-seq libraries which pass this QC threshold are prepared alongside a high-quality human reference RNA control. 100ng of RNA per sample is input to an Illumina TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kit, with protocol version 0.2. The yielded libraries undergo another round of QC through qPCR and quantified with a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, using its corresponding DNA BR Assay kit (Qubit), and size profiled on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Pools of 4 libraries in equimolar amounts are created and undergo a final round of QC. These pools are loaded onto paired-end flow cells of a HiSeq2500 equipped with a cBot for sequencing at: 101 read cycles, 7 index cycles, and 101. The samples will be sequenced on a HiSeq2500 using 101 cycles for read 1, 7 index reads, and another 101 cycles for read 2. Following sequencing data generation, the reads are demultiplexed through Illumina’s Genome Studio CASAVA software, which detected an average of 120 million reads per 4 sample pool.
COLON MAP samples that successfully formed organoids were dissociated and counted using a Bio-RAD TC20 automated cell counter and plated at 1,000 cells/well in 5 μL Matrigel domes in a 96-well plate. Organoids were imaged and counted using an inverted microscope (Fisherbrand) after 8 days in culture. Patient IDs were matched to histopathology results after compilation and tabulation of results. GraphPad Prism 9 was used for plotting and statistical analysis using unpaired t-tests.
COLON MAP organoids were cultured in appropriately supplemented Human IntestiCult organoid growth media (OGM) for 3 days. They either remained in OGM for control or switched to supplemented Human IntestiCult organoid differentiation media (ODM) (STEMCELL Technologies) for 3 more days. For IFN gamma treatment, human recombinant IFN-gamma (Biolegend) was added to each media condition at 100 ng/mL for 24 hours prior to harvesting.
For homeostatic lineage tracing studies, Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Rosa26 LSL-EYFP/+ mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 3 consecutive days with 2.5 mg tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich; T5648) in corn oil, while Mist1 CreERT2/+ ;Rosa26 LSL-EYF/+P were injected i.p. for 3 consecutive days with 5 mg tamoxifen. Mice were euthanized 24 h, 10 days, and 28 days later. For damage-induced lineage tracing, Mist1 CreERT2/+ ;Rosa26 LSL-EYFP/+ and Mist1 CreERT2/+ ;Rosa26 mT/mG/+ mice were injected i.p. for 3 consecutive days with 5 mg tamoxifen, and were then administered 2.5% DSS (TdB Consultancy; Batches DB001-37, DB001-42) in drinking water for the following 6 days. After cessation of DSS, mice were euthanized 24 h and 28 days later.
To recombine genes, Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Braf LSL-V600E/+ and Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Apc 2lox14/+ mice were induced and had their tissues harvested using established protocols ( Kondo et al., 2020 64.

The pan-ErbB negative regulator Lrig1 is an intestinal stem cell marker that functions as a tumor suppressor Cell. 2012; 149 :146-158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tissues were harvested from these mice approximately 12 weeks after induction of recombination. Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Kras LSL-G12D/+ mice were anesthetized and induced with 100 μL of 10 mg/mL 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol delivered with an enema using a gavage feeding needle, and tissues were harvested around 8 weeks later.
For generating tumors, Mist1 CreERT2/+ ;Apc 2lox14/2lox14 were injected intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days with 5 mg tamoxifen in corn oil. They were administered 2.5% DSS in drinking water for the following 6 days, followed by a 9-day rest period, and a second round of DSS. Lrig1 CreERT2/+ ;Apc 2lox14/2lox14 were injected with 0.01mM 4-hydroxytamoxifen through colonoscopy-guided orthotopic injections into the mucosal lining of the distal colon ( Roper et al., 2017 104. Roper, J. ∙ Tammela, T. ∙ Cetinbas, N.M. ... In vivo genome editing and organoid transplantation models of colorectal cancer and metastasis Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :569-576 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ), and were administered 2.5% DSS in drinking water for the following 6 days. Control mice received PBS injections followed by DSS. Mice were euthanized approximately 28 days following Cre induction.
Upon euthanasia of an animal, colonic tissue was removed, washed with 1X DPBS, spread longitudinally onto Whatman filter paper and fixed in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific) overnight. Fixed tissues were washed with 1X DPBS, swiss-rolled, and stored in 70% EtOH until processing and paraffin embedding. Tissues were sectioned at 5 mm thick onto glass slides. Slides were processed for deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0; Dako) for 20 minutes in a pressure cooker at 105°C followed by a 20-minute bench cool down. Endogenous background signal was reduced by incubating slides in 1% H 2 O 2 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes, before blocking for 30 minutes in 2.5% Normal Donkey Serum in 1X DPBS prior to antibody staining. Primary antibodies against selected markers were incubated on the slides in a humidity chamber overnight, followed by three washes in PBS, and 1 hour incubation in Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen), and compatible secondaries (1:500) conjugated to Invitrogen AlexaFluor-488 (AF-488) or Invitrogen AF-647. Slides were washed in 1X DPBS, mounted in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen) and imaged using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope with Axiovision digital imaging system (Zeiss; Jena GmBH). Multiplexed imaging using an immune cell-based antibody panel was performed by using a multiplex iterative staining and fluorescence-inactivation protocol, as previously described ( McKinley et al., 2017 87. McKinley, E.T. ∙ Sui, Y. ∙ Al-Kofahi, Y. ... Optimized multiplex immunofluorescence single-cell analysis reveals tuft cell heterogeneity JCI Insight. 2017; 2 :e93487 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 88. McKinley, E.T. ∙ Roland, J.T. ∙ Franklin, J.L. ... Machine and deep learning single-cell segmentation and quantification of multi-dimensional tissue images BioRxiv. 2019; Google Scholar ), and imaged on an Olympus X81 inverted microscope (20X magnification) with a motorized stage. For histological analysis, slides were processed and stained for hematoxylin and eosin and beta-catenin using standard approaches. Blind scoring was conducted by a pathologist (Dr. Kay Washington) using brightfield microscopy and a standard grading scale for dysplasia. Antibodies, working concentrations, and incubations can be found in the methods github repository: https://github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/STAR_Methods/blob/main/Methods_Tables.xlsx (Methods Table 3)
Organoids derived from Lrig1 and Mist1 tumors were dissociated using TrypLE Express. Cell pellets were resuspended in matrigel and seeded in 25 μL/well in a 24-well plate with 500 μL of Mouse Intesticult (STEMCELL Technologies) media. After one week, the number of organoids was counted using the GelCount system (Oxford Optronix). The number of organoids formed in each well was normalized to the number of single cells plated to determine organoid formation rate. Results were tabulated and plotted using Prism 9 (GraphPad) with unpaired t test.
Organoids were formed and cultured for one week in Matrigel and Mouse Intesticult media. They were collected and reseeded without Matrigel in media with 100 μg/mL DQ-Ovalbumin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for approximately 24 hours. After 24 hours, organoids were fixed, stained overnight with antibodies against GFP and Ia/Ie-AF647 (1:100; Biolegend), and analyzed using a BD LSRII 5-laser flow cytometer. Flow data were analyzed using Cytobank ( Kotecha et al., 2010 66. Kotecha, N. ∙ Krutzik, P.O. ∙ Irish, J.M. Web-Based Analysis and Publication of Flow Cytometry Experiments Curr. Protoc. Cytom. 2010; 53 :Unit10.17 Google Scholar ).
Naive OTII cells were isolated from the spleen of 8–10-week-old OT-II mice. Cells were purified using the naive CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) following manufacturer’s protocol. CD11c+ DCs were isolated using MagniSort Mouse CD11c Positive Selection Kit (Thermo Fisher) per manufacturer’s recommendations. Murine Organoids were dissociated with TrypLE containing 10 μM Y-27632 for 15 minutes at 37°C while shaking. Cells were counted using Bio-RAD TC20 automated cell counter for use in the antigen presentation assay.
To track T cell proliferation, naive CD4+ OTII T cells were labeled using 5 mM CellTrace Violet (Thermo Fisher) by incubating for 20 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO2 in PBS and then an equal volume of T cell media containing serum was added and incubated an additional 5 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO2 to quench free dye. 5x10 4 labeled OTII CD4+ T cells were plated in a 96-well round bottom plate with 2.5x10 5 organoid-dissociated single cells (without Matrigel) or 2.5x105 CD11c+ DCs and in the presence or absence of 50 μg/mL ovalbumin peptide (Anaspec), spun at 350 x g for 5 minutes and then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 for 72 hours. Following co-culture, cells were analyzed. Wells containing cells were pipetted up and down to resuspend all cells and placed in 5mL Falcon Round-Bottom Polystyrene Tubes. These were centrifuged briefly at 350 x g for 3 minutes at 4°C, washed in FACS buffer (PBS w/o Ca 2+ Mg 2+ , 2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA), and resuspended in 100 μL FACS buffer containing the antibody cocktail: https://github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/STAR_Methods/blob/main/Methods_Tables.xlsx (Methods Table 4), and stained for 15 min at 4°C. Cells were spun down as before, washed in FACS buffer, and were resuspended in 250 μL of FACS buffer and kept on ice until acquired on a 4-laser Fortessa. Cytometry data analysis was done using FlowJo v10 software and T cell proliferation results were tabulated and plotted in GraphPad Prism 9 using ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests.

After chelation but prior to single-cell dissociation, tissue was processed with a modified fixation/dissociation protocol ( Scurrah et al., 2019 108. Scurrah, C.R. ∙ Simmons, A.J. ∙ Lau, K.S.

Briefly, tissue was fixed for 15 min (0.1% Saponin in 4% PFA, RNase-inhibitor), washed (0.1% Saponin in 1X DPBS RNase-inhibitor), and stained overnight with primary antibodies against GFP and EPCAM (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotech) in wash buffer. The following day, samples were washed with 1X DPBS, followed by a 1-hour incubation with compatible secondary antibodies in wash buffer. Samples were subsequently fixed followed by mechanical disassociation into single cells before flow sorting using BD FACSAria III.
After sorting, total RNA was isolated from the flow sorted cells using the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Ambion), starting at the protease digestion stage of the manufacturer-recommended protocol similarly to Hrvatin et al. ( Hrvatin et al., 2014 53. Hrvatin, S. ∙ Deng, F. ∙ O’Donnell, C.W. ... MARIS: method for analyzing RNA following intracellular sorting PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e89459 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). The initial protease digest was scaled to the number of the cells post-sorting. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated from 160 ng of total RNA with Poly A priming using Maxima H minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher). The poly A capture primers used were the identical to unconjugated primers used for inDrop scRNA-seq ( Klein et al., 2015 61. Klein, A.M. ∙ Mazutis, L. ∙ Akartuna, I. ... Droplet barcoding for single-cell transcriptomics applied to embryonic stem cells Cell. 2015; 161 :1187-1201 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1493) PubMed Google Scholar ) in order to generate cDNA libraries comparable to the reference scRNA-seq datasets for downstream integrative analysis. RNA-seq libraries were prepared as in ( Southard-Smith et al., 2020 111. Southard-Smith, A.N. ∙ Simmons, A.J. ∙ Chen, B. ... Dual indexed library design enables compatibility of in-Drop single-cell RNA-sequencing with exAMP chemistry sequencing platforms BMC Genomics. 2020; 21 :456 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 as described below. To integrate with scRNA-seq datasets, the resulting bulk RNA-seq dataset was treated as a single cell datapoint, and normalized and processed accordingly ( Heiser et al., 2021 50. Heiser, C.N. ∙ Wang, V.M. ∙ Chen, B. ... Automated quality control and cell identification of droplet-based single-cell data using dropkick Genome Res. 2021; 31 :1742-1752 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and concentration was quantified using nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene-specific primers for SYBR Green real-time PCR were designed by PrimerBLAST ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/ ) and published sequences, and synthesized by Sigma Genosis. Real-time PCR was performed and analyzed using CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) and using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR conditions are 95°C for 3 min and followed by 40 cycle amplification (95°C for 15 s, 60°C 15 s, 72°C for 30 s). Relative mRNA expression was determined by normalizing to GAPDH expression, which served as an internal control. See Key Resources Table for primers used for qPCR.
The Single-Cell rEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering or SCENIC pipeline was used to integrate cancer, pre-cancer, and their corresponding normal tissue datasets ( Aibar et al., 2017 1. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ; Van de Sande et al., 2020 125. Van de Sande, B. ∙ Flerin, C. ∙ Davie, K. ... A scalable SCENIC workflow for single-cell gene regulatory network analysis Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15 :2247-2276 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each group of integrated datasets, we concatenated the individual target datasets with an outer join and generated a combined AnnData object ( Wolf et al., 2018 135. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ). This AnnData object underwent further gene filtering, selecting only those that were expressed in at least 1% of all cells, primarily for the sake of speedup in running the module inference step of SCENIC. The resulting cumulative count matrix was input, without normalization, into the first step of SCENIC with default parameters, as suggested by the published protocol. We used a Dask client to parallelize the grnboost2 version of this step on an AMD Threadripper 2990WX CPU. Subsequently, cisTarget was performed using default parameters and three hg19 .feather ranking databases, comparing 10 species: tss-centered-5kb, tss-centered-10kb, and 500bp-upstream.
Further, this cisTarget step produced a list of detected regulons, their driving TFs, and their corresponding weights for the prediction of individual gene expression. These weights were used to build a feature matrix defining each regulon by its predicted targets. This feature matrix was then used to generate an adjacency matrix per SCENIC integration run, which was the basis of the regulon-regulon target network. This target network was based on a k-nearest neighbors graph (with k equal to the square root of the number of total regulons) of the adjacency matrix. For each of these target networks, the Louvain community detection algorithm was run at a resolution of 2, defining super-regulons ( Traag et al., 2019 121. Traag, V.A. ∙ Waltman, L. ∙ van Eck, N.J. From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :5233 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ). This regulon-regulon target network (along with its cluster labels and average enrichment per regulon) was exported as a weighted adjacency matrix for visualization in Cytoscape (Shannon, 2003).
Finally, we performed AUCell with default recommended parameters across 64 threads to generate a regulon activity enrichment matrix, which was jointly analyzed with the count-based matrix. Additional regulon activity enrichment scores were calculated for the Broad cohort by performing AUCell with regulon definitions learned from VUMC pre-cancer and CRC datasets. For visualization, target-network heatmaps featuring these regulon enrichment values were Z-score transformed, color scaled in a regulon-wise manner, and standardized to jointly integrated normal biopsies or polyp-derived normal cells when possible.
Using scanpy and numpy functions, raw count data were normalized by median library size, log-like transformed with Arcsinh, and Z-score standardized per gene ( Harris et al., 2020 49. Harris, C.R. ∙ Millman, K.J. ∙ van der Walt, S.J. ... Array programming with NumPy Nature. 2020; 585 :357-362 Crossref Scopus (1464) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wolf et al., 2018 135. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ). This yielded interpretable unit variance scaled and centered values. Heatmaps featuring individual gene expression depict this normalized, transformed, and standardized data with color scaling in a gene-wise manner.
Three modes of UMAP visualization were used in this study based on regulons, feature-selected counts, or Harmony-corrected components. All human epithelial UMAP visualizations were generated using the “scanpy.tl.umap” function with a min_dist parameter of 0.15. The input to this function was Z-score standardized AUCell values, their 50-principal component decompositions with no feature selection, and a subsequent KNN graph with k equal to the square root of the number cells projected. Human nonepithelial UMAP visualizations that included all nonepithelial subtypes were performed the same way. To finely resolve T cell subtypes with UMAP, we generated a KNN based on the PCA of a feature-selected set of genes after normalizing, log-like transforming with Arcsinh, and Z-score standardizing raw counts. Finally, murine validation experiments were integrated with the Harmony algorithm, generating adjusted principal components with default parameters ( Korsunsky et al., 2019 65. Korsunsky, I. ∙ Millard, N. ∙ Fan, J. ... Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1289-1296 Crossref Scopus (387) PubMed Google Scholar ). These components were used as the basis for KNN and UMAP generation with the same parameters as used in the human data. For t-SNE visualizations, the perplexity was set to the same as the k used in the UMAP KNN graph. The bootstrapped variant of t-SNE visualization was performed by running t-SNE with the same parameters 100 times to ensure qualitatively robust embeddings, given the algorithms inherent stochasticity.
We used a gene signature scoring method implemented in scanpy and first detailed by ( Satija et al., 2015 105. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (1359) PubMed Google Scholar ). This method scores a defined gene set by finding the difference between its average expression against the average expression of randomly sampled sets of reference genes, corresponding to matched and binned expression levels. Each signature in this study was calculated on normalized, transformed, and standardized data (as described in the scRNA-seq, Count Matrix Normalization and Heatmap Generation section) using a reference sample size of 2000 genes across 25 bins. The x axis range of scatterplots featuring these signature data was set by excluding single-cell outliers beyond the 1.5x interquartile range. Statistical tests of these score distributions encompass an initial Kruskal-Wallis test. If the null hypothesis was rejected, these tests were followed by post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests and appropriate p value adjustments ( Terpilowski, 2019 117. Terpilowski, M. scikit-posthocs: Pairwise multiple comparison tests in Python J. Open Source Softw. 2019; 4 :1169 Crossref Google Scholar ; Varoquaux et al., 2015 129. Varoquaux, G. ∙ Buitinck, L. ∙ Louppe, G. ... Scikit-learn. GetMobile Mob Comput. Commun. 2015; 19 :29-33 Google Scholar ). The resulting statistics are found in Table S4 .

The labeling of single-cell subpopulations was done through the Leiden algorithm, as part of the Scanpy toolkit. We performed Leiden clustering based on the KNN derived from the distances calculated in the principal component space of Z-score transformed regulon enrichment scores, as these represented cell-cell transcriptional states in a more batch-robust manner. The resolution of this clustering was based on the detection of rarer populations such as enteroendocrine cells, at 2. Since this algorithm detected discrete clusters in a continuum of cell states, we aggregated multiple discrete clusters by the observation of marker gene expression. Similarly, these methods were applied to nonepithelial datasets given their regulon or feature-selected matrices, depending on the subtypes of interest. This Leiden algorithm was also used to determine clusters for murine scRNA-seq validation experiments. Higher resolution subclustering was also done by performing k-means clustering after the initial Leiden clustering. Importantly, some subclusters were identified as a result of patient-to-patient variation originating from mitochondrial read enrichment, as evidenced by mitochondrial read percentage distributions and GO terms. These subclusters were identified and statements regarding their relative, subpopulational variation were excluded. These patient-to-patient variations did not affect overall comparisons between tumor-specific and normal cell types. For example, after excluding these mitochondrially-enriched subclusters, the SSC subpopulational analysis focused on GO terms related to intercellular communication and stromal interactions.
The differential testing of gene expression was performed based on cluster labels (as defined by the scRNA-seq, Unsupervised Clustering and Cell Type Labeling section), both in the context of raw gene counts and regulon enrichment values. For both cases, we used Mann-Whitney U tests with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections, on the raw values, implemented through the “scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups” function, identifying the top 200 genes and top 50-100 regulons ( Wolf et al., 2018 135. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, biological insight was gathered through scanpy’s integration of g:profiler gene set enrichment framework ( Raudvere et al., 2019 102. Raudvere, U. ∙ Kolberg, L. ∙ Kuzmin, I. ... g:Profiler: a web server for functional enrichment analysis and conversions of gene lists (2019 update) Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W191-W198 Crossref Scopus (832) PubMed Google Scholar ). The full differential expression, GSEA tables, and their respective statistics generated through g:Profiler are available in Tables S6 and S7 . This process was also performed on the stem and TSC components of the murine scRNA-seq datasets using the GSEA webapp ( Mootha et al., 2003 91. Mootha, V.K. ∙ Lindgren, C.M. ∙ Eriksson, K.-F. ...

USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (21125) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given the detected clusters (as described in the scRNA-seq, Unsupervised Clustering and Cell Type Labeling section), we calculated the proportional cell type representations of each individual sample. We counted the raw number of epithelial and nonepithelial cells as well as the raw number of cells falling into any given cell cluster. These results were cross-tabulated as contingency tables, summarizing how many cells were observed in each category and for which samples using pandas. Proportional values were then calculated by normalizing cluster counts to the number of epithelial cells per sample ( Figures 2 C and S2 C) or to the cumulative number of cells per sample ( Figures 6 C and S6 D). Clusters were designated as polyp-specific populations if, proportionally, they were significantly overrepresented in polyp samples and not normal samples, which was indicated by post hoc statistical tests following Kruskal-Wallis null hypothesis rejection. The resulting statistics are found in Table S4 . The x axis range of scatterplots featuring these proportional representation data was set by excluding samples with values beyond the 1.5x interquartile range. In the context of the murine scRNA-seq datasets, the proportional representation of cell types was calculated by normalizing to the total number of epithelial or immune cell subtypes for each Mist1 and Lrig1 tumor sample.
CytoTRACE is a relative scoring method dependent on included datasets for inferring developmental potential. CytoTRACE was performed based on the default recommended settings after concatenating the batches of interest using an outer join ( Gulati et al., 2020 47. Gulati, G.S. ∙ Sikandar, S.S. ∙ Wesche, D.J. ... Single-cell transcriptional diversity is a hallmark of developmental potential Science. 2020; 367 :405-411 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed CytoTRACE with five separate groupings of single-cell libraries. First, the discovery cohort ( Figures 2 E and S2 E), including all epithelial cells from both its normal biopsies and polyps. Second, the validation cohort ( Figures 2 E and S2 E), including all epithelial cells from both its normal biopsies and polyps. Third, the epithelial VUMC polyp-specific cells ( Figure 4 E), including only tumor-specific cells from VUMC AD, MSS, SER, and MSI-H samples. Fourth, the epithelial Broad cohort ( Figures 4 E), including MSS, MSI-H, and Normal samples. The Broad cohort (including n = 32 normal samples) distribution was only calculated from 50% random sample of the total cells detected due to memory constraints. Fifth, CytoTRACE was performed on the stem and TSC component of the murine scRNA-seq datasets. Statistical tests of these score distributions encompass an initial Kruskal-Wallis test. If the null hypothesis was rejected, these tests were followed by post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests and appropriate p value adjustments. The resulting statistics are found in Table S4 .
The single-cell distributions of CMS scores were calculated on the VUMC ASC, MSS, SSC, and MSI-H and the Broad MSI and MSI-H libraries using the CMSclassifier R package as described by ( Eide et al., 2017 35. Eide, P.W. ∙ Bruun, J. ∙ Lothe, R.A. ... CMScaller: an R package for consensus molecular subtyping of colorectal cancer pre-clinical models Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :16618 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guinney et al., 2015 46. Guinney, J. ∙ Dienstmann, R. ∙ Wang, X. ... The consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1350-1356 Crossref Scopus (2041) PubMed Google Scholar ). To accommodate the heterogeneity of the single-cell landscape, the single sample predictor or SSP mode of the software was used after converting gene symbols to Entrez IDs. This SSP mode calculated the median correlation distance between each single cell to established, standard centroids derived from CMS1, CMS2, CMS3, and CMS4 CRC subtypes. Further, these score distributions were visualized through a normalized kernel density estimation implemented in the Seaborn python package. Statistical tests of these score distributions encompass an initial Kruskal-Wallis test. If the null hypothesis was rejected, these tests were followed by post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests and appropriate p value adjustments. The resulting statistics are found in Table S4 .
pCreode was used to map the developmental state transitions of the single-cell transcriptional landscape of our Discovery cohort pre-cancer and normal COLON MAP samples ( Herring et al., 2018 51. Herring, C.A. ∙ Banerjee, A. ∙ McKinley, E.T. ... Unsupervised Trajectory Analysis of Single-Cell RNA-Seq and Imaging Data Reveals Alternative Tuft Cell Origins in the Gut Cell Syst. 2018; 6 :37-51 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). This algorithm was generalized to process regulon-based principal components, inheriting its batch-robust properties. By examining the variation captured by the principal components, we selected the first 4 components based on their capture of rare cell populations, such as Tuft and enteroendocrine cells. We developed this algorithm to traverse a density weighted KNN generated from the pairwise distances between each single cell; subsequently, we used a histogram thresholding method to estimate the neighborhood distance cutoff for calculating local densities. These densities were used as input to a supervised variant of pCreode, which established developmental endstates through K-means clustering and marker-defined labels. The downsampling and noise parameters were both set to 4, resulting in samples of around 6,000 cells per run, and repeated 50 times. Each of these runs was scored by the minimization of the Gromov–Hausdorff distance, resulting in a single, most representative graph layout. Overlays were generated based on pre-computed single-cell observation vectors, such as a CytoTRACE score, or the normalized, transformed, and z-scored gene expression values.
RNA velocity analysis was performed using velocyto CLI version 0.17 ( La Manno et al., 2018 68. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individual sample BAM files were used as input to the “run-dropest” command along with a human gene annotation file (GTF) for GRCh38.85, and a tab-delimited text file containing dropkick-filtered cell barcodes from the corresponding sample as the “—bcfile” flag. Then, scVelo version 0.2.3 was used to build models of splicing kinetics to estimate and visualize RNA velocity vector fields in SCENIC integrated UMAP space ( Bergen et al., 2020 12. Bergen, V. ∙ Lange, M. ∙ Peidli, S. ... Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1408-1414 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each sample was individually filtered to the top 2,000 genes expressed in a minimum of 20 cells using the function “scvelo.pp.filter_and_normalize.” The moments of all RNA velocity vectors were calculated with 30 principal components and 30 nearest neighbors using the function “scvelo.pp.moments” prior to estimating velocities using “scvelo.tl.velocity” with default parameters. Finally, velocity UMAP embeddings were plotted using the function “scvelo.pl.velocity_embedding_stream” and the subset of SCENIC master UMAP coordinates for each sample.
We used DENDRO, an algorithm designed to reconstruct subclonal phylogenies within scRNA-seq datasets ( Zhou et al., 2020 143. Zhou, Z. ∙ Xu, B. ∙ Minn, A. ... DENDRO: genetic heterogeneity profiling and subclone detection by single-cell RNA sequencing Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :10 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, information of both somatic and germline single nucleotide variations (SNVs) are used in this reconstruction, differing from purely somatic variant-based methods. Since our sequencing libraries are generated through the tag-based inDrop method, the short, 3′-biased reads necessitated the aggregation of single-cell transcriptomes. For each of the 34 sequencing libraries we performed this analysis on (24 ADs, 11 SERs), we defined 20 aggregate populations through regulon-based K-means clustering (Hartigan and Wong, 1979). Thus, we predicted the average genotypic representation of multiple single-cells, or pseudo-bulk RNA-seq libraries, and created a phylogenetic tree between the defined clusters. DropEst produced a filtered and sorted .bam file, which we derived read information from, and split into 20 distinct .bam files using the sinto python package. These bam files were then processed with GATK4 ( Van der Auwera et al., 2013 126. Van der Auwera, G.A. ∙ Carneiro, M.O. ∙ Hartl, C. ... From FastQ data to high confidence variant calls: the Genome Analysis Toolkit best practices pipeline Curr. Protoc. Bioinforma. 2013; 43 :11.10.1-11.10.33 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), according to guidelines detailed by Zhou et al. The GATK4 steps of this pipeline involved the following: adding read groups, marking duplicates, splitting N-cigar reads, applying base quality recalibration with known single nucleotdie polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotype calling (with the GATK4 HaplotypeCaller and an hg38 reference) to generate VCF files, consolidating these VCFs into genomicsdb databases, and then genotyping these data.
Because the measurement of SNVs within transcriptomes is dependent on dynamic expression patterns, we used a beta-binomial framework, as described by Zhou et al., to model genetic divergence between each pseudo-bulk, cell aggregate. Standard genetic divergence frameworks, such as those comparing DNA-derived genomic variants, do not consider the varying levels of low nor high gene expression between pseudo-bulk populations. Examples of this transcription-specific variation would be stochastic bursts of gene expression captured in a minority of populations, yielding low average expression across all populations, and constitutively expressed genes, yielding high average expression across all populations. These bursty loci will more likely represent genes dropped out from the majority of pseudo-bulk populations, so including its respective variants would yield an inflated genetic divergence value. Conversely, variants in loci that are expressed and observed in the vast majority of pseudo-bulk populations would be uninformative in terms of phylogenetic discrimination. The genetic divergence d between each possible cell aggregate pair c and c’ at loci g is represented formally as: 𝑑 𝑔 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑐 ′ = l o g ⁡ 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑋 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑁 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 ) 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑋 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑁 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝐼 𝑐 = 𝐼 𝑐 ′ ) Where c and c’ represent two different cell aggregates, while I and I’ represent their originating clonal groups. Correspondingly, X cg is the alternative allele read count for cell aggregate c at loci g , while N cg is the respective total read count. Thus, d is a function of five derived probabilities: 𝑃 𝑔 Which, first, represents the alternative allele frequency across cell aggregates estimated by the above GATK4 pipeline. 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 c ⁢ g , 𝑍 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 = 0 ) ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑍 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 = 0 ) Which, second and third, represent detected variants due to rare editing and technical sequencing error events in c and c’ at g . Here, Z cg is set as 0, modeling scenarios lacking SNVs, which can be approximated as the following binomial distribution with ε set to 0.001 or 0.1%. 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑍 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 = 0 ) ∼ 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝜀 ) ε, representing the combined error rate, was used according to our sequencing platform, a NovaSeq 6000 System. This is in line with empirical studies of Illumina sequencing instruments as detailed by Stoler et al., observing a median error rate of 0.109% across 239 samples on a NovaSeq 6000 device ( Stoler and Nekrutenko, 2021 112. Stoler, N. ∙ Nekrutenko, A. Sequencing error profiles of Illumina sequencing instruments NAR Genomics Bioinforma. 2021; 3 :lqab019 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Another previous study by Fox et al. had similar estimates for sequencing-by-synthesis platforms, including the Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq2000, with an error frequency of 10 −3 (or 0.1%) attributed to single nucleotide substitutions ( Fox et al., 2014 39. Fox, E.J. ∙ Reid-Bayliss, K.S. ∙ Emond, M.J. ... Accuracy of Next Generation Sequencing Platforms Next Gener. Seq. Appl. 2014; 1 :1000106 PubMed Google Scholar ). 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 c ⁢ g , 𝑍 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 = 1 ) ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑍 𝑐 ′ ⁢ 𝑔 = 1 ) Which, fourth and fifth, represent detected variants due to the presence of SNVs in c and c’ at g . In this case, Z cg is set as 1, modeling scenarios with SNVs present. 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑍 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 = 1 ) ∼ ∫ 1 0 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁡ 𝑙 ⁡ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ I ⁢ 𝑁 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑄 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑔 = 𝑞 ) ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁡ ( 𝑞 ) , 𝑞 ∼ 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁡ ( 𝛼 𝑔 , 𝛽 𝑔 ) This can be approximated as a beta-binomial distribution, as previously described by Jiang et al. and Skelly et al. in the context of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing ( Skelly et al., 2011 110. Skelly, D.A. ∙ Johansson, M. ∙ Madeoy, J. ... A powerful and flexible statistical framework for testing hypotheses of allele-specific gene expression from RNA-seq data Genome Res. 2011; 21 :1728-1737 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiong et al., 2019 136. Xiong, L. ∙ Xu, K. ∙ Tian, K. ... SCALE method for single-cell ATAC-seq analysis via latent feature extraction Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4576 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Q cg is the proportion of alternative alleles in cell aggregate c at g , using a beta distribution prior, approximated as q . q is parameterized by α g and β g , as estimated gene activation and deactivation rates respectively.
Before performing genetic divergence calculations based on these probabilistic models, two filters were applied to minimize the inclusion of stochastically or constitutively expressed variants:
The first filter is dependent on the observed variant allele frequencies (VAFs) across each set of cell aggregates. VAFs were visualized as histograms representing the number of times each unique variant was observed across each set of cell aggregates. We observed that these VAF distributions were unimodal and positively skewed, with the vast majority of variants being detected in very few cell aggregates, which was in line with stochastic gene expression. To remove these stochastically expressed variants, we heuristically determined a cutoff at observed convex elbow/knee points of the curve, at 10%. This cutoff was symmetrically applied to the top 10% of the most pervasive variants as well, as these represented constitutively expressed variants.
The second filter is dependent on α and β parameter estimations. If either the α or β parameters of the beta prior were estimated to be 0 or 1, it meant that the activation and deactivation rates were completely on or off. Akin to the rationale for our first filter, these variants would not be informative in the genetic divergence calculation since they likely represent genes with a tendency to dropout/be stochastically expressed or be constitutively active. These cases would inflate or deflate genetic divergence metrics, respectively.
The quality of the filtered variants, consisting of about 5.07% (std. 1.46%) of the initially detected variants, met appropriate QD and DP levels suggested by GATK4 guidelines and were also located within genomic regions characteristic of the inDrop barcoding chemistry ( https://github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/STAR_Methods/blob/main/Supplemental_Table_Variant_Type_Func.refGene_Distribution.xlsx ). Exonic variants detected through this method were validated through the exome sequencing of paired FFPE tissue and respective GATK HaplotypeCaller pipeline. If the exact exonic genomic loci and genotypes were detected in both the exome and scRNA-seq pseudo-bulk aggregates, the variants were flagged as validated. An average of 53.9% (std. 12.9%, max > 75%) of the exonic variants detected through scRNA-seq were validated with this orthogonal exome sequencing. Tables of these detected variants per cell population and their exome-seq statuses are shown at ( https://github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/STAR_Methods/tree/main/Tables ).
After filtering, the genetic divergence is calculated for all possible pairs of cell aggregates, and a phylogenetic tree is constructed. The leaves of these trees represent the previously defined cell aggregates, which were assigned cell type labels accordingly. For each set of pseudo-bulk cell aggregates, we also calculated the minimum genetic divergence between tumor-specific cell aggregates (ASCs and SSCs) and canonical stem cell aggregates (STM). These values were normalized to the maximum distances observed per tumor sample, yielding a value between 0 and 1. This metric was interpolated with a value of 1 in samples which lacked measurable canonical stem cell aggregates.
Cell segmentation was accomplished using the MANDO pipeline ( McKinley et al., 2019 88. McKinley, E.T. ∙ Roland, J.T. ∙ Franklin, J.L. ... Machine and deep learning single-cell segmentation and quantification of multi-dimensional tissue images BioRxiv. 2019; Google Scholar ). Briefly, random forest pixel classification on manually annotated images was used to define tissue and subcellular regions in each image. An initial watershed segmentation using cell nuclei as seed points and the learned cell membranes as boundaries was followed by re-segmentation of objects containing internal cell membranes. For every identified cell, image intensities for each marker were then calculated as well as morphological features such as cell size and location. For quantifying marker positive cells in MxIF, we fitted linear mixed effects models on the logit transformed cell proportions within epithelial or stromal tissue compartments. We estimated the proportion of marker positive cells within each compartment, by dividing the number of marker positive cells by the total number of cells within the tissue compartment. We added 1/2 to the numerator and denominator of the proportion to accommodate zero proportions; this is equivalent to a Bayesian estimator for the proportions using a noninformative beta prior. We fit the logit transformed proportions using a linear mixed effects model with an interaction between tissue compartment (epithelium/stromal), tissue type (AD/SSL), and a random effect for slide to account for the correlation between regions on a slide ( Bates et al., 2015 11. Bates, D. ∙ Mächler, M. ∙ Bolker, B. ... Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4 J. Stat. Softw. 2015; 67 :1-48 Crossref Scopus (28743) Google Scholar ). We estimated differences between tumor types within each tissue compartment using emmeans. We computed false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p values using Benjamini-Hochberg. For murine tissue, tumor areas were established by a beta-Catenin mask and cell counts for image quantification were determined the same way as human tissues.
MATLAB was initially used to create masks to mark positive pixels of each cell type marker from MxIF images. The tumor region was divided into an epithelial region (masked by beta-Catenin, pan-Cytokeratin, and NaKATPase expression) and a stromal region (tumor mask minus the epithelial mask). An overlay of OLFM4, MUC5AC, and PANCK was used as a guide for identifying stem (OLFM4+) and metaplastic (MUC5AC+) epithelial (PANCK+) regions, which were then manually demarcated. Each region was validated by quantifying MUC5AC and OLFM4 positive pixels within the regions. Cell types were defined by combinations of marker masks; for example, CD4+ T cells were defined by intersecting CD4 and CD3 pixel masks. On the other hand, CD8+ T cells were defined using the CD8 marker. We then calculated the fraction of pixels occupied by each cell type, normalized to the number of pixels of each tumor region. For example, a ratio of intraepithelial CD8+ cells to stromal CD4+ T cells was calculated from two sets of values calculated in this way. The measurements from all regions of the same type within each tumor was used to calculate a mean value; thus, each patient is a biological replicate. One-way ANOVAs with Dunnett post-tests were used for statistical testing. For IHC images, a similar process was used, with whole tumor regions demarcated by tissue morphology using hematoxylin nuclear counterstain. Antibody stains (3,3′-diaminobenzidine - DAB or 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole - AEC) were spectrally unmixed such that individual marker masks can be generated and quantified as above.
