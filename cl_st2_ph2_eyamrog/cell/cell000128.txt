Title: A Unified Model for the Function of YTHDF Proteins in Regulating m 6 A-Modified mRNA


Abstract: Summary

N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) is the most abundant mRNA nucleotide modification and regulates critical aspects of cellular physiology and differentiation. m 6 A is thought to mediate its effects through a complex network of interactions between different m 6 A sites and three functionally distinct cytoplasmic YTHDF m 6 A-binding proteins (DF1, DF2, and DF3). In contrast to the prevailing model, we show that DF proteins bind the same m 6 A-modified mRNAs rather than different mRNAs. Furthermore, we find that DF proteins do not induce translation in HeLa cells. Instead, the DF paralogs act redundantly to mediate mRNA degradation and cellular differentiation. The ability of DF proteins to regulate stability and differentiation becomes evident only when all three DF paralogs are depleted simultaneously. Our study reveals a unified model of m 6 A function in which all m 6 A-modified mRNAs are subjected to the combined action of YTHDF proteins in proportion to the number of m 6 A sites.

Section: Introduction

Methylation of adenosine in mRNA to form N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) has important roles in cellular physiology. Initial studies in Arabidopsis and yeast showed defective seed development and sporulation, respectively, upon genomic deletion of the m 6 A-forming methyltransferase ( Clancy et al., 2002; Zhong et al., 2008 12.

More recent studies have further documented the connection between m 6 A and cellular differentiation in embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells, acute myeloid leukemia cells, as well as other cell types ( Barbieri et al., 2017; Cui et al., 2017; Geula et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2019; Vu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014b 6.

Together, these studies show that m 6 A affects cellular physiology and that these effects likely reflect modulation of mRNA fate by m 6 A.
The effects of m 6 A in cytosolic transcripts are thought to be mediated by a poorly understood and complex network of interactions between specific m 6 A sites and specific members of the YT521-B homology Domain-containing Family (YTHDF) family of m 6 A-binding proteins ( Shi et al., 2017, 2019 54.

The YTHDF family includes three paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3; also called DF1, DF2, and DF3, respectively), each of which has different reported functions; DF1 enhances mRNA translation, DF2 promotes mRNA degradation, and DF3 enhances translation and degradation ( Li et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014a, 2015 32.

According to the prevailing model ( Shi et al., 2017, 2019 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Shi, H. ∙ Wei, J. ∙ He, C. Where, When, and How: Context-Dependent Functions of RNA Methylation Writers, Readers, and Erasers Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :640-650 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1105) PubMed Google Scholar ), the largest fraction of m 6 A-modified mRNAs (m 6 A-mRNAs; ~44%) bind a single DF paralog, but some m 6 A-mRNAs (~32%) bind two DF paralogs. m 6 A-mRNAs that bind all three DF paralogs are relatively rare (24%). Based on these studies, each DF paralog mediates the effects of m 6 A by targeting specific cohorts of m 6 A-mRNAs, which has led to the major concept that different DF paralogs control distinct physiologic processes ( Anders et al., 2018; Han et al., 2019; Hesser et al., 2018; Paris et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2018 2.

Although the ability of the DF paralogs to bind different m 6 A sites is fundamental to explain the different biology of the DF paralogs, it remains unclear how they achieve selective binding to different m 6 A sites. Additionally, the mechanistic basis of the different functions of DF proteins remains unknown, especially in light of their high sequence identity ( Patil et al., 2018; Wang and He, 2014 48. Patil, D.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R.

Reading RNA methylation codes through methyl-specific binding proteins RNA Biol. 2014; 11 :669-672 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here we present a fundamentally different model to explain the effects of m 6 A on mRNA and how DF proteins mediate these effects. In contrast to the prevailing view that different m 6 A sites bind largely different DF paralogs, we find that all m 6 A sites bind all three DF paralogs in an essentially similar manner. Thus, all DF paralogs regulate the same mRNAs based on the presence of m 6 A sites. We also find that DF paralogs are not translation enhancers, as currently thought for DF1 and DF3. Instead, we show that the major effect of the three DF paralogs is to promote mRNA degradation in a largely redundant manner. The redundant effect of DF depletion has not been detected previously because these proteins are typically depleted separately rather than simultaneously. Depletion of only one protein allows for varying degrees of compensation by the other paralogs. Our finding that DF paralogs have similar functions rather than different functions is supported by their essentially identical m 6 A-binding properties, their similar set of associated binding proteins, and their shared subcellular localizations. Furthermore, we show that the effects of m 6 A on cellular differentiation can be explained by the combined action of the three DF proteins rather than individual DF proteins. Overall, these studies reveal a new unified model of m 6 A function in which m 6 A predominantly influences mRNA degradation via the combined action of the three largely redundant DF proteins.

Section: Results

An important concept in m 6 A-mediated gene regulation is that the different DF proteins bind distinct subsets of m 6 A residues in the transcriptome ( Han et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017, 2018, 2019; Wang et al., 2015 21.

As a result, m 6 A is thought to influence mRNAs in different ways, depending on which DF paralog it binds. Based on this, a set of DF1, DF2, or DF3 “unique” m 6 A sites is commonly used for analysis of the function of each DF paralog ( Han et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Park et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2017, 2018, 2019 21.

Because this m 6 A-specific binding behavior of the DF paralogs ultimately determines how m 6 A regulates cellular processes, a major goal is to understand the basis of selective m 6 A recognition by the DF paralogs.
To address this, we first asked whether differences in the YT521-B homology (YTH) domains might account for the different binding preferences of the DF proteins. The YTH domain comprises ~134 amino acids and mediates selective binding to m 6 A ( Li et al., 2014; Patil et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2015 31. Li, F. ∙ Zhao, D. ∙ Wu, J. ...

Chem. 2015; 290 :24902-24913 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used the crystal structures of the DF1 and DF2 YTH domains bound to m 6 A-containing RNA ( Li et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015 31. Li, F. ∙ Zhao, D. ∙ Wu, J. ... Structure of the YTH domain of human YTHDF2 in complex with an m(6)A mononucleotide reveals an aromatic cage for m(6)A recognition Cell Res. 2014; 24 :1490-1492 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Xu, C. ∙ Liu, K. ∙ Ahmed, H. ... Structural Basis for the Discriminative Recognition of N6-Methyladenosine RNA by the Human YT521-B Homology Domain Family of Proteins J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :24902-24913 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ) to annotate the amino acids that recognize m 6 A and the adjacent nucleotides. In the case of DF3, an RNA-bound structure has not yet been reported; however, each of the amino acids that bind m 6 A and the adjacent nucleotides in DF1 and DF2 is conserved in DF3 ( Figure S1 A), suggesting that the structural mechanism of m 6 A binding is the same for all three DF proteins.
It remains possible that the few amino acids that differ between the YTH domains ( Figure S1 A) could affect RNA binding. However, these amino acids map on the surface opposite the RNA-binding pocket ( Figure 1 A), suggesting that they might not affect YTH-RNA interactions. Furthermore, each full-length DF protein shows a similar binding affinity for an m 6 A-containing RNA oligonucleotide ( Figure S1 B), consistent with previous studies ( Arguello et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2014a; Xu et al., 2015 4. Arguello, A.E. ∙ Leach, R.W. ∙ Kleiner, R.E.

Chem. 2015; 290 :24902-24913 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, the RNA-binding surfaces for the three YTH domains appear to be identical.
The different transcriptome-wide binding properties reported for the DF paralogs ( Shi et al., 2017 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar ) could reflect the ability of the different DF paralogs to bind different m 6 A sequence motifs. m 6 A residues are almost exclusively found in a single highly conserved sequence motif: DR-m 6 A-CH (D = A, G, U; R = A, G; H = A, C, U) ( Canaani et al., 1979; Dimock and Stoltzfus, 1977; Linder et al., 2015; Wei et al., 1976 9.

Identification and mapping of N6-methyladenosine containing sequences in simian virus 40 RNA Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6 :2879-2899 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar 14. Dimock, K. ∙ Stoltzfus, C.M. Sequence specificity of internal methylation in B77 avian sarcoma virus RNA subunits Biochemistry. 1977; 16 :471-478 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Linder, B. ∙ Grozhik, A.V. ∙ Olarerin-George, A.O. ... Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :767-772 Crossref Scopus (1095) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Wei, C.M. ∙ Gershowitz, A. ∙ Moss, B. 5′-Terminal and internal methylated nucleotide sequences in HeLa cell mRNA Biochemistry. 1976; 15 :397-401 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that the differential association of DF paralogs with distinct sets of m 6 A sites could be explained by their preferences for certain DR-m 6 A-CH submotifs, such as GG-m 6 A-CU versus AG-m 6 A-CU.
To determine the binding preference for each DF paralog, we examined our recently generated transcriptome-wide iCLIP (individual-nucleotide-resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) maps of the binding sites of endogenously expressed DF1, DF2, and DF3 in HEK293T cells ( Patil et al., 2016 47. Patil, D.P. ∙ Chen, C.-K. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ... m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Nature. 2016; 537 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ). We calculated the percentage of each DR-m 6 A-CH sequence submotif at each DF-binding site identified by iCLIP and ranked the most common sequence submotifs bound by each DF paralog. These analyses showed a nearly identical frequency of each DR-m 6 A-CH submotif bound by each DF paralog ( Figure 1 B). The rank order of the prevalence of the submotifs recognized by the DF paralogs was similar to the overall prevalence of each m 6 A submotif in the transcriptome ( Linder et al., 2015 33. Linder, B. ∙ Grozhik, A.V. ∙ Olarerin-George, A.O. ... Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :767-772 Crossref Scopus (1095) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 B). Thus, each DF paralog shows the same binding preferences, which largely correlate with the prevalence of m 6 A motifs, rather than a paralog-specific sequence preference.
Although the DF paralogs seem to bind m 6 A in proportion to the prevalence of the m 6 A motif, each paralog may be targeted to a different set of m 6 A sites, as suggested by previous studies ( Shi et al., 2017, 2019 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar 56.

Cell. 2019; 74 :640-650 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 C). Thus, we sought to identify the m 6 A sites uniquely bound by each DF paralog.
To do this, we quantified the number of DF1, DF2, and DF3 reads from the iCLIP datasets performed in HEK293T cells ( Patil et al., 2016 47. Patil, D.P. ∙ Chen, C.-K. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ... m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Nature. 2016; 537 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ) that map to each HEK293T m 6 A site ( Linder et al., 2015 33. Linder, B. ∙ Grozhik, A.V. ∙ Olarerin-George, A.O. ... Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :767-772 Crossref Scopus (1095) PubMed Google Scholar ) or, similarly, the FLAG-DF1 and FLAG-DF2 reads from the PhotoActivatable Ribonucleoside-enhanced Crosslinking and ImmunoPrecipitation (PAR-CLIP) datasets performed in HeLa cells ( Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014a, 2015 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ∙ Gomez, A. ... N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability Nature. 2014; 505 :117-120 Crossref Scopus (2980) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mapped at each HeLa m 6 A site ( Ke et al., 2017 24. Ke, S. ∙ Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ Saito, Y. ... m 6 A mRNA modifications are deposited in nascent pre-mRNA and are not required for splicing but do specify cytoplasmic turnover Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :990-1006 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar ). We could not use the FLAG-DF3 PAR-CLIP dataset ( Shi et al., 2017 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar ) because it contained a low number of reads mappable to cytosolic mRNAs ( Figure S1 D).
Using this m 6 A-centric approach, we found a strong linear correlation in pairwise comparisons between DF1, DF2, and DF3 reads at each m 6 A site. This correlation was seen in the PAR-CLIP datasets in HeLa cells mapped onto HeLa m 6 A sites ( Figures S1 E–S1F), as well as the iCLIP datasets in HEK293T cells mapped onto HEK293T m 6 A sites ( Figure 1 C). Notably, in contrast to the previous model where many m 6 A sites show DF paralog-specific binding, we found no preferential enrichment of iCLIP or PAR-CLIP reads for any paralog at any m 6 A site. Overall, these results suggest that each m 6 A site is bound by DF1, DF2, and DF3 in similar proportions.
Because we were surprised by the lack of m 6 A sites uniquely bound by each of the DF proteins, we reexamined the previously reported DF1 and DF2 unique RNA-binding sites ( Shi et al., 2017 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar ). We asked whether DF1 binding, as measured by PAR-CLIP signal, was missing at DF2 unique sites and vice versa. To test this, we plotted DF2 binding at each DF1 unique site and vice versa. This analysis shows that there is a comparable level of DF1 and DF2 binding at each DF1 unique site and a comparable level of DF1 and DF2 binding at each DF2 unique site ( Figures S1 G and S1H). Thus, the previously described unique sites instead appear to be indistinguishable in terms of their DF1 and DF2 binding.
Next, we directly examined the PAR-CLIP reads on individual transcripts proposed to be DF1 unique or DF2 unique. After extensive visual inspection, we found essentially no differences in the distribution of DF1 and DF2 PAR-CLIP reads for any of these transcripts ( Figure S1 J). Notably, the PAR-CLIP reads correlated with the location of m 6 A-called sites, supporting the idea that DF binding is due to m 6 A. A similar effect was seen when using the iCLIP datasets for DF1, DF2, and DF3 ( Figure 1 D). These data further suggest that the sites that were previously described as being DF paralog unique are not, in fact, unique.
Our reexamination of the iCLIP and PAR-CLIP studies contrast with previous reports showing that each DF paralog has only partial overlap with m 6 A sites and with each other ( Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014a, 2015 54.

In the PAR-CLIP studies, DF paralog-binding sites were determined based on a threshold number of misincorporation-containing reads at any individual site in the transcriptome. However, using a threshold approach in independent experiments can often produce false negative sites. These arise because of the arbitrary nature of a threshold, which can cause some sites to be missed when they fall just beneath that threshold. For this reason, the threshold approach is not generally used for comparative analysis of datasets ( Chakrabarti et al., 2018; Guertin et al., 2018; Landt et al., 2012 10.

Instead, comparative analysis is often performed by selecting a set of specific transcriptomic sites, such as sequence motifs, and determining whether one CLIP dataset or another shows preferential binding to any of these sites ( Dominguez et al., 2018; Wheeler et al., 2018 17. Dominguez, D. ∙ Freese, P. ∙ Alexis, M.S. ... Sequence, Structure, and Context Preferences of Human RNA Binding Proteins Mol. Cell. 2018; 70 :854-867.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Wheeler, E.C. ∙ Van Nostrand, E.L. ∙ Yeo, G.W. Advances and challenges in the detection of transcriptome-wide protein-RNA interactions Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2018; 9 :e1436 Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar ). Our approach is similar; by comparing DF paralogs binding at mapped m 6 A sites, we find that the RNA binding of DF paralogs is essentially identical, even when using different cell lines and different CLIP methodologies (iCLIP and PAR-CLIP).
Overall, these diverse lines of evidence, including structural similarity, motif analysis, and analysis of DF binding at each m 6 A site in the transcriptome using CLIP datasets from two cell lines, suggest that the DF paralogs do not exhibit different patterns of m 6 A-binding in the transcriptome. Instead, they appear to have similar binding preferences and affinities.
Although we find that the DF paralogs bind the same m 6 A sites, an unresolved question is how these nearly identical proteins exert different molecular effects on m 6 A-mRNAs, especially in the case of DF1 (translation) compared with DF2 (degradation). A compelling possibility for divergent functions of DF paralogs might lie within their effector domain, an ~40-kDa low-complexity domain that comprises the remainder of the protein outside of the YTH domain ( Patil et al., 2018 48. Patil, D.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. Reading m 6 A in the Transcriptome: m 6 A-Binding Proteins Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :113-127 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recruitment of a distinct set of proteins to the effector domain of each DF paralog may allow the DF paralogs to exert different effects on m 6 A-mRNAs. We thus analyzed the differences in the effector domains between DF paralogs as well as their protein interaction partners.
Examination of the three effector domains shows them to be superficially similar. Each is a proline and glutamine-rich low-complexity domain with ~60% amino acid identity and 70% amino acid similarity ( Figure S2 A). Furthermore, the hydrophobicity and charge distribution along the length of the low-complexity domains are highly similar. Additionally, the positions of the disordered regions within the low-complexity domains are similar for each paralog ( Figure 2 A).
The different DF proteins may have different protein interaction partners to mediate their different functions. We therefore examined a recent comprehensive Bio-ID study in which 139 proteins were BirA tagged, and interacting proteins were detected based on their proximity-induced biotinylation ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). In these experiments, 937–1,360 proteins were detected as possible DF interactors, of which 63–103 were identified as high-confidence interactors (63 of 937 DF1 interactors, 100 of 1,270 DF2 interactors, and 103 of 1,360 DF3 interactors).
To determine which interactors are preferentially bound by each DF paralog, we performed a scatterplot analysis in which each biotinylated interactor was plotted as a circle, with the x and y axis position each reflecting the average spectral counts for one of the three DF paralogs. In this pairwise analysis, we found similar proteins bound by all three paralogs. Additionally, we found a marked linear correlation in the spectral counts for each high-confidence protein interactor when examined in pairwise comparisons of DF1, DF2, and DF3 ( Figure 2 B). Thus, the DF binding partners seem to be shared and bind with the same overall rank order preference for all three DF paralogs.
Notably, the top 25 interactors of all three DF paralogs were highly similar and included high-scoring interactions with components of the Carbon Catabolite Repression-Negative On TATA-less (CCR4-NOT) RNA degradation complex, such as CNOT1, CNOT7, and CNOT10 ( Figures 2 B and S2 B). Other high-confidence interactors of all three DF paralogs included RNA degradation proteins such as PATL1, XRN1, LSM12, and DDX6. In addition, all three DF paralogs interact with protein components of stress granules ( Figures 2 B and S2 B). Stress granule proteins interact even in the absence of stress ( Markmiller et al., 2018; Youn et al., 2018 36. Markmiller, S. ∙ Soltanieh, S. ∙ Server, K.L. ... Context-Dependent and Disease-Specific Diversity in Protein Interactions within Stress Granules Cell. 2018; 172 :590-604.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (555) PubMed Google Scholar 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, all of these interactors have been seen in other studies. For example, CNOT1 immunoprecipitation studies have identified all three DF paralogs ( Du et al., 2016 18. Du, H. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ He, J. ... YTHDF2 destabilizes m(6)A-containing RNA through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12626 Crossref Scopus (989) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, an engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX)-based proteomics analysis of the G3BP1 stress granule protein found all three DF paralogs to be interactors ( Markmiller et al., 2018 36. Markmiller, S. ∙ Soltanieh, S. ∙ Server, K.L. ... Context-Dependent and Disease-Specific Diversity in Protein Interactions within Stress Granules Cell. 2018; 172 :590-604.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (555) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, all three DF paralogs show similar patterns of binding proteins, and the major interactions are seen across independent proteomic datasets.
Because DF1 is thought to regulate translation through its interactions with the eIF3A and eIF3B translation initiation factors ( Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wanted to determine whether DF1 shows selective and robust interactions with these proteins. The Bio-ID proteomics analyses ( Figure 2 B) shows weak interactions of eIF3A and eIF3B with all three DF paralogs, and in each case, the probability of interaction was low. Previous analysis of DF1-binding partners identified eIF3A and eIF3B based on mass spectrometry analysis of DF1 immunoprecipitates ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in that study, eIF3A and eIF3B were among the lowest-scoring DF1 interactors ( Figure S2 C). The weak binding seen in immunoprecipitates is consistent with the low probability seen in the Bio-ID studies ( Figure 2 B). Thus, each proteomic study suggests that all three DF paralogs exhibit nonspecific or low-level binding to eIF3A and eIF3B in cells.
Overall, the protein-protein interactions of all three DF paralogs are very similar, rather than different, with high-confidence interactions with RNA degradation machinery and low-confidence interactions with translation machinery.
To further understand the different functions of the DF paralogs, we examined their subcellular localizations because distinct subcellular localizations might be expected for proteins with different functions. In the Bio-ID study ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ), a non-negative matrix factorization classification analysis was developed to predict the subcellular localization of 139 RNA-binding proteins based on their interaction partners. The prominent localizations predicted for all three DF paralogs were P-bodies and cytoplasmic mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes ( Figure 2 C). Thus, DF paralogs are predicted to have similar subcellular localizations.
To further test this, we examined the localization of each DF paralog by immunofluorescence. Here we found that all three DF paralogs showed essentially identical localization throughout the cytoplasm in small punctate structures and, to a lower extent, in larger punctate structures. Although the smaller ones resemble the granule-like particles detected previously under unstressed conditions ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ), the larger punctate structures were identified as P-bodies based on their colocalization with EDC4, a P-body marker ( Figure 2 D). This is consistent with an independent proteomic analysis using P-body markers that also identified all three DF paralogs in P-bodies ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, rather than exhibiting distinct localizations in cells, DF proteins have similar punctate cytoplasmic localizations, some of which include localization to P-bodies. Overall, these data suggest that DF proteins have highly similar sequences, functional domains, protein binding partners, and intracellular localizations.
Because all DF paralogs show high-confidence interactions with RNA degradation pathway proteins ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 B), we considered the possibility that each paralog may function to mediate degradation of m 6 A-mRNA.
Previous comparative studies of the DF paralogs found that some of them induce mRNA degradation when artificially tethered to a reporter transcript ( Kennedy et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2017; Tirumuru et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014a, 2015 25.

N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, because these studies used heterologously overexpressed DF proteins, we were concerned about the potential for these proteins to aggregate into stress granule-like structures when overexpressed. This phenomenon is seen in proteins, like the DF paralogs, that contain low-complexity domains ( Alberti et al., 2019 1. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T. Considerations and Challenges in Studying Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Biomolecular Condensates Cell. 2019; 176 :419-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1505) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we observed variable levels of DF granule-like structures after transfecting cells with DF-expressing plasmids ( Figure S2 D). Thus, DF overexpression experiments may be misleading because of the variable degrees of DF aggregation, which could sequester proteins and potentially suppress their function. We therefore re-examined the role of DF paralogs using knockdown approaches instead.
We first examined mRNA abundance using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) after small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of DF1 , DF2 , and DF3 in HeLa cells. We used siRNA that we validated for selective high-efficiency DF1, DF2, and DF3 knockdown ( Patil et al., 2016 47. Patil, D.P. ∙ Chen, C.-K. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ... m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Nature. 2016; 537 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 A–S3C). Because m 6 A sites on mRNAs bind all the three DF paralogs ( Figures 1 and S1 ), we examined how m 6 A-mRNAs were affected by DF depletion and whether the effects were correlated with the number of m 6 A sites ( Table S1 ). As in a previous study of DF1 ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found no effect of DF1 depletion on m 6 A-mRNA abundance compared with non-methylated mRNAs ( Figure 3 A). In contrast, as reported previously ( Wang et al., 2014a 62. Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ∙ Gomez, A. ... N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability Nature. 2014; 505 :117-120 Crossref Scopus (2980) PubMed Google Scholar ), depletion of DF2, the most highly expressed DF paralog in HeLa cells ( Patil et al., 2018 48. Patil, D.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. Reading m 6 A in the Transcriptome: m 6 A-Binding Proteins Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :113-127 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 D), was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the abundance of m 6 A-mRNAs ( Figure 3 B). This effect was more pronounced for mRNAs with high numbers of annotated m 6 A sites. No increase in m 6 A-mRNA abundance was observed following DF3 depletion ( Figure 3 C), which, like DF1, is more lowly expressed in HeLa cells ( Patil et al., 2018 48. Patil, D.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. Reading m 6 A in the Transcriptome: m 6 A-Binding Proteins Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :113-127 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 D). Overall, our data confirm the idea that DF2, but not DF1 or DF3, destabilizes m 6 A-mRNAs.
We then considered the possibility that the DF paralogs may be functionally redundant and that our inability to detect a stability-regulatory effect was due to compensation by the other paralogs. Additionally, we noticed that knockdown of any of the DF paralogs was associated with a compensatory increase in the expression of the other paralogs in HeLa cells ( Figures S3 A–S3B). Thus, compensatory upregulation of the other DF paralogs could further mask an effect of knockdown.
We therefore tested simultaneous knockdown of different combinations of two DF paralogs or all three DFs. Knocking down any two DF paralogs increased the overall abundance of m 6 A-mRNA ( Figures S3 E–S3I). Importantly, the selective increase in m 6 A-mRNA expression was largest upon triple knockdown ( Figure 3 D), and, in each case, it was directly correlated with the number of m 6 A sites per mRNA ( Figures 3 D and S3 F–S3H). Double knockdown and triple knockdown exhibited greater increases in m 6 A-mRNA abundance than DF2 knockdown alone ( Figure 3 E). These data are consistent with a model in which any of the DF proteins can promote degradation of m 6 A-mRNAs, but m 6 A-mRNA degradation is most effective when all three DF paralogs are available, resulting in maximal DF-dependent m 6 A-mRNA degradation.
To determine whether the expression levels seen upon triple DF knockdown are correlated with changes in mRNA stability levels, we measured the levels of m 6 A-mRNAs after transcription inhibition with actinomycin D. Because m 6 A-mRNAs tend to have a short half-life ( Ke et al., 2017; Schwartz et al., 2014 24. Ke, S. ∙ Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ Saito, Y. ... m 6 A mRNA modifications are deposited in nascent pre-mRNA and are not required for splicing but do specify cytoplasmic turnover Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :990-1006 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Schwartz, S. ∙ Mumbach, M.R. ∙ Jovanovic, M. ... Perturbation of m6A writers reveals two distinct classes of mRNA methylation at internal and 5′ sites Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :284-296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (938) PubMed Google Scholar ), we treated cells with actinomycin D for 2 h and measured the amount of each mRNA remaining using RNA-seq. mRNA stability was relatively unaffected upon depletion of each DF paralog individually, except in the case of DF2, where a small stabilizing effect was seen ( Figure 3 F). However, when all three DF paralogs were knocked down, a substantial increase in mRNA stability was seen for m 6 A-containing mRNAs compared with non-m 6 A-mRNAs ( Figure 3 F). These effects were also seen in qRT-PCR experiments examining the stability of specific mRNAs annotated to contain high numbers of m 6 A sites or annotated to lack m 6 A ( Figure S3 J).
Overall, these data further suggest that the most efficient degradation of m 6 A-mRNAs occurs when all three DF paralogs are present. When DF1 or DF3 is knocked down alone, the effects are nearly undetectable, but knockdown of DF1 and DF3 together or in combination with DF2 resulted in readily detectable increases in m 6 A-mRNA mRNA expression ( Figure 3 E). This suggests that the other DF paralogs can partially compensate for the loss of another DF. The ability of any DF protein to compensate is likely to be influenced by its expression level, with the lower expression of DF1 and DF3 ( Figure S3 D) making them less able to compensate for DF2 depletion. In this model, when all three DF paralogs are depleted, compensation cannot occur, and m 6 A-mRNA stability is increased most robustly.
Although our data strongly indicate that DF paralogs act together to destabilize m 6 A-mRNA, it remains possible that one or more of these proteins could also control m 6 A-mRNA translation. Importantly, DF1 and DF3 have been described to be enhancers of m 6 A-mRNA translation ( Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we examined the role of the DF paralogs in translational regulation of m 6 A-mRNAs.
DF1 has been proposed to enhance translation by binding m 6 A and recruiting eIF3 to 3′ UTRs. This subsequently facilitates loading of eIF3 onto mRNA caps ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is reminiscent of the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1, which also binds 3′ UTRs, binds an initiation factor, and promotes formation of initiation complexes at mRNA caps ( Le et al., 1997; Ozoe et al., 2013; Wells et al., 1998 29. Le, H. ∙ Tanguay, R.L. ∙ Balasta, M.L. ... Translation initiation factors eIF-iso4G and eIF-4B interact with the poly(A)-binding protein and increase its RNA binding activity J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 2 :135-140 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ability of PABPC1 to enhance mRNA translation is evident based on its enrichment in the polysome fractions corresponding to highly translated mRNAs ( Arava et al., 2003 3. Arava, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Storey, J.D. ... Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :3889-3894 Crossref Scopus (535) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We therefore examined whether DF1 is similarly enriched with highly translated mRNAs. However, all three DF paralogs are mostly excluded from the polysome fraction ( Figure 4 A and S4 A) and highly enriched in the fractions at the beginning of the gradients, which represent cytoplasmic mRNPs ( Arava et al., 2003 3. Arava, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Storey, J.D. ... Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :3889-3894 Crossref Scopus (535) PubMed Google Scholar ). This result is not consistent with a model in which any DF protein is stably bound to mRNA 3′ UTRs, enhancing their translation.
Despite the absence of DF paralogs from the highly translating mRNA pool, we wanted to examine whether translation of m 6 A-mRNAs is enhanced by any of the DF paralogs.
We first examined the published ribosome profiling data that revealed the translation-enhancing effect of DF1 ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, processed data were provided, listing the abundance of ribosome-protected fragments that map to each gene. When we examined the processed data obtained after DF1 silencing, it was evident that m 6 A-mRNAs were less translated than in control siRNA-transfected samples ( Figure S4 B). Thus, consistent with the previous study ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ), but in contrast to what was expected from the polysome analysis ( Figure S4 A), DF1 silencing causes a reduction in translation of m 6 A-mRNAs. This analysis was performed using the average of the two ribosome profiling replicates, as described in the original study.
However, we found different results when the processed data of the two DF1 siRNA replicates were analyzed separately. Replicate 1 showed a prominent decrease in translation of m 6 A-mRNAs upon DF1 depletion, consistent with the idea that DF1 enhances translation of m 6 A-mRNA ( Figure S4 C). However, replicate 2 showed no change in translation of m 6 A-mRNAs upon DF1 silencing ( Figure S4 D). Thus, the overall reduction in m 6 A-mRNA translation we saw in the averaged data ( Figure S4 B) was driven by the large drop in m 6 A-mRNA translation seen in replicate 1.
Because we were surprised by the different roles of DF1 implied by the two different replicates, we re-processed the raw sequencing data generated in the Wang et al. (2015) 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar study. Upon reanalysis using the standard pipeline for alignment and calculation of ribosome-protected fragments ( Calviello et al., 2016; McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017 8. Calviello, L. ∙ Mukherjee, N. ∙ Wyler, E. ... Detecting actively translated open reading frames in ribosome profiling data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :165-170 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar 38. McGlincy, N.J. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Transcriptome-wide measurement of translation by ribosome profiling Methods. 2017; 126 :112-129 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ), both replicates showed the same result: DF1 depletion did not affect m 6 A-mRNA translation efficiency ( Figures S4 E–S4G; Tables S2 and S3 ), similar to the effect seen with the previously processed replicate 2 but not replicate 1.
To understand the basis of the inconsistencies between the original replicate 1 and 2, we generated correlation coefficients for the ribosome-protected fragments between replicates. Here we saw only modest correlation in the number of ribosome-protected fragments per m 6 A-mRNA between the original replicates ( Figure S4 H). In contrast, the re-processed data showed high correlation ( Figure S4 I), as expected for replicates. We therefore considered that a bioinformatic rather than a biological artifact may have caused variability in the original reported analysis. Overall, based on one of the original replicates, and based on both replicates after re-processing of the raw ribosome profiling data from Wang et al. (2015) 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar , DF1 does not regulate translation of m 6 A-mRNAs.
We next examined DF3, which has also been proposed previously to promote translation ( Shi et al., 2017 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this previous analysis, DF3-bound mRNAs were identified by PAR-CLIP, and the translation efficiency of these mRNAs was analyzed after DF3 knockdown ( Shi et al., 2017 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we found that the DF3 PAR-CLIP dataset did not contain a sufficient number of mappable reads, as described above ( Figure S1 D). We therefore decided to reanalyze the effect of DF3 depletion on mRNAs based on the number of m 6 A sites because m 6 A sites correlate with DF3 binding ( Figure 1 ). Here we saw that DF3 depletion does not affect the translation efficiency of m 6 A-mRNAs ( Figure S4 J).
Because of the various inconsistencies, we wanted to independently confirm the effects of depleting each DF paralog on the translation efficiency of m 6 A-mRNAs using ribosome profiling. In each experiment, we generated three replicates for knockdown and control ( Figures S3 A, S3B, and S5 A–S5C). We found no reduction in translation efficiency of m 6 A-mRNAs compared with non-methylated mRNAs in DF1-deficient HeLa cells ( Figure 4 B). Similarly, neither DF2 nor DF3 depletion was associated with a change in translation in m 6 A-mRNAs by ribosome profiling ( Figures 4 C and 4D). As a second approach, we quantified the levels of specific m 6 A-mRNAs at each position along the polysome gradient. We focused on specific m 6 A-mRNAs reported to show the largest drop in translation after DF1 depletion ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we saw no decrease in translation upon DF1 depletion ( Figure S5 D).
Because all three DF proteins redundantly mediate mRNA degradation, we considered the possibility that they may also redundantly regulate mRNA translation. We therefore performed ribosome profiling after knockdown of all three paralogs ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Here we still saw no reduction but a slight enhancement in the translation efficiency of m 6 A-containing transcripts ( Figure 4 E).
Overall, multiple independent datasets demonstrate that DF1 has no translation-promoting role in HeLa cells, including the original data used to show the translation-promoting effect of DF1. Thus, none of the DF paralogs directly enhance mRNA translation. Instead, their major effect is to mediate m 6 A-mRNA degradation.
One of the most well-studied examples of m 6 A-regulated cellular differentiation is in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, where m 6 A maintains cells in an undifferentiated blast-like state ( Barbieri et al., 2017; Vu et al., 2017 6. Barbieri, I. ∙ Tzelepis, K. ∙ Pandolfini, L. ... Promoter-bound METTL3 maintains myeloid leukaemia by m 6 A-dependent translation control Nature. 2017; 552 :126-131 Crossref Scopus (772) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Vu, L.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... The N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A)-forming enzyme METTL3 controls myeloid differentiation of normal hematopoietic and leukemia cells Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1369-1376 Crossref Scopus (888) PubMed Google Scholar ). Knockdown of METTL3 induces expression of markers such as CD14, a transmembrane protein that reflects differentiation and commitment to the myeloid lineage. Depletion of DF2 affects expression of m 6 A-RNAs whose repression may contribute to leukemogenesis, such as TNFRSF1B ( Paris et al., 2019 45. Paris, J. ∙ Morgan, M. ∙ Campos, J. ... Targeting the RNA m 6 A Reader YTHDF2 Selectively Compromises Cancer Stem Cells in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25 :137-148.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ). Attempts to identify the m 6 A reader that mediate the differentiation-suppressive effects of m 6 A have not yet been successful. Recent studies have suggested that DF2 does not mediate the differentiation-suppressive effects of m 6 A because DF2 knockout does not induce differentiation ( Paris et al., 2019 45. Paris, J. ∙ Morgan, M. ∙ Campos, J. ... Targeting the RNA m 6 A Reader YTHDF2 Selectively Compromises Cancer Stem Cells in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25 :137-148.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ), which contrasts the effect of METTL3 depletion ( Barbieri et al., 2017; Vu et al., 2017 6. Barbieri, I. ∙ Tzelepis, K. ∙ Pandolfini, L. ... Promoter-bound METTL3 maintains myeloid leukaemia by m 6 A-dependent translation control Nature. 2017; 552 :126-131 Crossref Scopus (772) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Vu, L.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... The N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A)-forming enzyme METTL3 controls myeloid differentiation of normal hematopoietic and leukemia cells Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1369-1376 Crossref Scopus (888) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it has not been possible to ascribe the differentiation-suppressive effects of m 6 A to a specific m 6 A reader.
We therefore asked whether suppression of TNFRSF1B is mediated by the combined action of the three DF proteins. For these experiments, we knocked down each DF transcript alone or in combination in MOLM-13 leukemia cells, which, as we and others showed previously, were maintained in an undifferentiated state by METTL3 ( Barbieri et al., 2017; Vu et al., 2017 6. Barbieri, I. ∙ Tzelepis, K. ∙ Pandolfini, L. ... Promoter-bound METTL3 maintains myeloid leukaemia by m 6 A-dependent translation control Nature. 2017; 552 :126-131 Crossref Scopus (772) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Vu, L.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... The N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A)-forming enzyme METTL3 controls myeloid differentiation of normal hematopoietic and leukemia cells Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1369-1376 Crossref Scopus (888) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S5 G). TNFRSF1B mRNA expression levels were slightly affected by knockdown of each of the DF paralogs individually, with the largest increase seen with DF2 knockdown ( Figure 5 A). However, upon knockdown of all three DF paralogs, TNFRSF1B expression was markedly enhanced ( Figure 5 A). Overall, these data further support the idea that the DF proteins act redundantly to control the expression levels of m 6 A-mRNAs in MOLM-13 cells.
We next examined the role of DF proteins in suppressing differentiation. DF2 depletion on its own does not induce differentiation, as measured by the CD14 differentiation marker ( Paris et al., 2019 45. Paris, J. ∙ Morgan, M. ∙ Campos, J. ... Targeting the RNA m 6 A Reader YTHDF2 Selectively Compromises Cancer Stem Cells in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25 :137-148.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore asked whether the combined action of the DF paralogs suppresses differentiation. To test this idea, we measured CD14 5 days after knockdown of DF paralogs using flow cytometry. Similar to the previous study ( Paris et al., 2019 45. Paris, J. ∙ Morgan, M. ∙ Campos, J. ... Targeting the RNA m 6 A Reader YTHDF2 Selectively Compromises Cancer Stem Cells in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25 :137-148.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ), we did not find induction of CD14 upon knockdown of DF2 ( Figure 5 B). However, upon triple knockdown, CD14 expression was markedly increased. Overall, these data are consistent with the idea that the three DF paralogs function together to mediate the differentiation-suppressing effects of m 6 A.

Section: Discussion

The YTHDF family proteins DF1, DF2, and DF3 are major cytosolic m 6 A-binding proteins and are thought to mediate the effects of m 6 A in the cytosol ( Patil et al., 2018 48. Patil, D.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. Reading m 6 A in the Transcriptome: m 6 A-Binding Proteins Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :113-127 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to the prevailing model, where each DF paralog binds to distinct subsets of mRNAs, we show that the DF paralogs bind proportionately to each m 6 A site throughout the transcriptome. Additionally, rather than exerting different effects on different m 6 A-mRNAs, we show that the three DF proteins function together to mediate degradation of m 6 A-containing mRNAs. Although depletion of single DF paralogs leads to mild or no effects on mRNA abundance and stability, depleting all three DF proteins leads to robust stabilization of m 6 A-mRNAs, suggesting that each paralog can fully or partially compensate for the function of the other DF paralogs. Lastly, we find that previous studies that linked DF proteins to mRNA translation were affected by bioinformatic and technical issues, which led to the incorrect view that a major function of DF proteins was to promote translation. Instead, we show that DF paralogs do not appear to directly enhance translation of m 6 A-mRNAs in HeLa cells. Our comprehensive analysis of DF paralog function reveals a unified model of DF protein binding and function, with the major effect of m 6 A to mediate mRNA degradation through the combined effects of all three DF paralogs.
The issue of whether DF paralogs bind different mRNAs or the same mRNAs is a central question for understanding m 6 A function in cells. If each DF paralog binds different mRNAs, then each DF would affect different cellular pathways and processes. This prevailing model has created the impetus for knockout studies focusing on separate analysis of each DF paralog, with the goal of understanding the specific functions of each. However, this model lacks a clear mechanism to explain how the DF paralogs could bind different m 6 A sites.
Our analysis supports the opposite conclusion. We find that all m 6 A sites bind all DF proteins in an essentially indistinguishable manner, with the main determinant of DF paralog binding simply being the presence of the m 6 A site. The level of DF binding is likely to be correlated with m 6 A stoichiometry, which would positively correlate with the degradation effect. It should be noted that some m 6 A sites may bind DF paralogs poorly when they are obscured by local RNA structure or by binding of nearby RNA-binding proteins that limit access to m 6 A.
Another central question is that of establishing the function of the major cytoplasmic m 6 A readers DF1, DF2, and DF3. This is arguably the most important step in understanding m 6 A biology because it can explain how the effects of m 6 A can be rationalized in diverse m 6 A-dependent processes. The current concept is that m 6 A, through the action of different DF proteins, can induce mRNA translation, mRNA degradation, or both and that this effect is transcript specific ( Shi et al., 2017, 2019 54. Shi, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Lu, Z. ... YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Shi, H. ∙ Wei, J. ∙ He, C. Where, When, and How: Context-Dependent Functions of RNA Methylation Writers, Readers, and Erasers Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :640-650 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1105) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In contrast to this prevailing model, we find diverse lines of evidence supporting the idea that DF proteins have similar rather than different functions. In addition to the high sequence identity in the RNA-binding and effector domains, DF proteins have similar cytoplasmic localizations, including P-body localization, and similar protein interactors, which are hallmarks of proteins with similar functions. Most notable among the binding partners for all three DF proteins are CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex proteins, supporting the idea that all DF paralogs have a common role in mRNA degradation. A recent study showed that all three DF proteins, when heterologously expressed, bind CNOT1 and elicit mRNA deadenylation ( Du et al., 2016 18. Du, H. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ He, J. ... YTHDF2 destabilizes m(6)A-containing RNA through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12626 Crossref Scopus (989) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ability of all three DF proteins to mediate deadenylation supports the overall finding that the major function of these proteins is to mediate degradation of m 6 A-mRNAs. Further studies may also address whether the position of m 6 A along the transcript body has an effect on DF-mediated mRNA degradation.
Our data do not support the idea that DF paralogs have a direct role in regulating mRNA translation efficiency. Our reanalysis of previously published data, together with our independent ribosome profiling datasets and analysis of individual m 6 A-mRNAs by polysome fractionation analysis performed in the same cell line, shows no evidence of decreased translation of m 6 A-mRNAs upon depletion of DF proteins. This conclusion is consistent with the previously published protein polysome fractionation analysis ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as the new one presented here, which do not show an enrichment of DF proteins in the fractions containing highly translated mRNAs. Thus, DF proteins, including DF1, do not behave like other translation-enhancing RNA-binding proteins that bind the 3′ UTR ( Le et al., 1997; Ozoe et al., 2013; Wells et al., 1998 29. Le, H. ∙ Tanguay, R.L. ∙ Balasta, M.L. ... Translation initiation factors eIF-iso4G and eIF-4B interact with the poly(A)-binding protein and increase its RNA binding activity J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 2 :135-140 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, protein interaction analysis shows a lack of high-confidence interactions of the DF paralogs with translation initiation factors in cells ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, these diverse lines of evidence suggest that DF proteins do not promote translation. Although we cannot exclude a role of DF proteins in translation enhancement in other cell lines or conditions, our current findings are not consistent with a role of any DF paralog in regulating m 6 A-mRNA translation, at least in the original cell line and conditions where which DF1 was originally linked to translational regulation.
Although DF proteins do not promote translation, m 6 A can promote translation through DF-independent mechanisms. m 6 A can affect 3′ UTR length ( Ke et al., 2017 24. Ke, S. ∙ Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ Saito, Y. ... m 6 A mRNA modifications are deposited in nascent pre-mRNA and are not required for splicing but do specify cytoplasmic turnover Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :990-1006 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar ), which can indirectly affect translation. m 6 A may directly bind eIF3 when m 6 A is in the 5′ UTR ( Meyer et al., 2015 40. Meyer, K.D. ∙ Patil, D.P. ∙ Zhou, J. ... 5′ UTR m(6)A Promotes Cap-Independent Translation Cell. 2015; 163 :999-1010 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1352) PubMed Google Scholar ), or m 6 A may be associated with bound METTL3, which may facilitate translation ( Choe et al., 2018 11. Choe, J. ∙ Lin, S. ∙ Zhang, W. ... mRNA circularization by METTL3-eIF3h enhances translation and promotes oncogenesis Nature. 2018; 561 :556-560 Crossref Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, because eIF3 and METTL3 are thought to bind just a small subset of m 6 A sites, the role of eIF3 and METTL3 binding in the overall cellular effects of m 6 A is likely to be limited to specific transcripts ( Zaccara et al., 2019 72. Zaccara, S. ∙ Ries, R.J. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. Reading, writing and erasing mRNA methylation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :608-624 Crossref Scopus (1394) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our finding that all DF paralogs contribute to mRNA destabilization reconciles findings made by diverse groups where depletion of DF1 was not associated with reduced mRNA translation. For example, DF1 depletion does not affect translation of a heterologously expressed m 6 A-mRNA in MCF7 cells ( Slobodin et al., 2017 57. Slobodin, B. ∙ Han, R. ∙ Calderone, V. ... Transcription Impacts the Efficiency of mRNA Translation via Co-transcriptional N6-adenosine Methylation Cell. 2017; 169 :326-337.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ) and does not affect translation of m 6 A-mRNAs in neurons when using a DF1 tethering system unless a stimulus is added ( Shi et al., 2018 55. Shi, H. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Weng, Y.-L. ... m 6 A facilitates hippocampus-dependent learning and memory through YTHDF1 Nature. 2018; 563 :249-253 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the lack of translation regulation seen upon DF1 depletion can now be explained by the new model of DF function presented here.
In light of our current findings, phenotypes seen upon DF depletion likely derive from upregulation of m 6 A-mRNAs. Depletion of any single DF protein can affect mRNA levels to a small degree, which can still result in clear cellular effects. For example, recent studies show that m 6 A suppresses interferon beta ( IFNB1 ) mRNA levels and that knockdown of different DF paralogs can cause a small increase in the abundance and translation of this transcript ( Winkler et al., 2019 68. Winkler, R. ∙ Gillis, E. ∙ Lasman, L. ... m 6 A modification controls the innate immune response to infection by targeting type I interferons Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :173-182 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because cells are sensitive to small increases in IFNB1 , single DF knockdown can lead to readily detectable cellular effects. These hypomorphic phenotypes may be different from METTL3 depletion because METTL3 depletion would cause more a substantial increase in the levels of highly m 6 A-modified mRNAs and affect multiple cellular pathways, potentially leading to very different phenotypes.
Although DF proteins appear to have similar functions, depletion of different DF paralogs can have different effects. This is because DF proteins exhibit markedly different expression levels ( Patil et al., 2018 48. Patil, D.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. Reading m 6 A in the Transcriptome: m 6 A-Binding Proteins Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :113-127 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, depletion of a low-abundance DF paralog, such as DF3, is likely to only affect a small number of highly sensitive mRNAs, whereas depletion of a higher-abundance DF paralog would affect a larger subset of mRNAs, causing a different phenotype. Additionally, because DF paralogs may be expressed at different levels in different tissues, single DF paralog depletion can result in tissue-specific phenotypes ( Nishizawa et al., 2017 41. Nishizawa, Y. ∙ Konno, M. ∙ Asai, A. ... Oncogene c-Myc promotes epitranscriptome m 6 A reader YTHDF1 expression in colorectal cancer Oncotarget. 2017; 9 :7476-7486 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). DF paralogs may also be phosphorylated in a paralog-specific manner ( Patil et al., 2018; Zaccara et al., 2019 48. Patil, D.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. Reading m 6 A in the Transcriptome: m 6 A-Binding Proteins Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :113-127 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Zaccara, S. ∙ Ries, R.J. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. Reading, writing and erasing mRNA methylation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :608-624 Crossref Scopus (1394) PubMed Google Scholar ) or selectively induced in response to specific stimuli, as seen with p63-dependent induction of DF3 ( Birkaya et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2017 7. Birkaya, B. ∙ Ortt, K. ∙ Sinha, S. Novel in vivo targets of DeltaNp63 in keratinocytes identified by a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation approach BMC Mol.

YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N 6 -methyladenosine-modified RNA Cell Res. 2017; 27 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar ). These pathways and subtle DF-paralog amino acid sequence differences may confer additional modes of regulation that can affect the ability of DF paralogs to induce m 6 A-mRNA degradation.
Notably, the functions of the DF paralogs may differ depending on the cellular context. For example, in cell stress, DF proteins bind m 6 A-mRNA and relocalize to stress granules, but the mRNA is not targeted for degradation ( Ries et al., 2019 51. Ries, R.J. ∙ Zaccara, S. ∙ Klein, P. ... m 6 A enhances the phase separation potential of mRNA Nature. 2019; 571 :424-428 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). In neurons, DF proteins have also been localized to transport granules and may therefore have roles in trafficking m 6 A-mRNA to dendrites and, thus, indirectly promote translation in neurons ( Merkurjev et al., 2018; Ries et al., 2019 39. Merkurjev, D. ∙ Hong, W.-T. ∙ Iida, K. ... Synaptic N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) epitranscriptome reveals functional partitioning of localized transcripts Nat.

Ries, R.J. ∙ Zaccara, S. ∙ Klein, P. ... m 6 A enhances the phase separation potential of mRNA Nature. 2019; 571 :424-428 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, for cell types that exhibit the classic mRNA-destabilization effect of m 6 A, which has been seen in diverse cell types ( Geula et al., 2015; Ke et al., 2017; Vu et al., 2017 19.

The absolute frequency of labeled N-6-methyladenosine in HeLa cell messenger RNA decreases with label time J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124 :487-499 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ), the likely mediator of this m 6 A-dependent destabilization effect is the combined action of DF1, DF2, and DF3.

HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) cells of female origin were maintained in 1x DMEM (11995-065, Life Technologies) with 10% FBS, 100 U ml -1 penicillin and 100 μg ml -1 of streptomycin under standard culture conditions. Cells were split with TrypLE Express (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HeLa cells were authenticated. MOLM-13 (man origin) were maintained in 1x RPMI with 10% FBS, 100 U ml -1 penicillin and 100 μg ml -1 of streptomycin under standard culture condition. MOLM-13 cells were a kind donation from the laboratory of M. Kharas and were not authenticated during this study.
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, 30 nM siRNA was transfected using Pepmute transfection reagent (Signagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 48 h after the first transfection, a second transfection was performed. Cells were maintained at 70%–80% confluency and when necessary expanded in a 10-cm dish. Cells were then collected 4 days after the first transfection. When silencing multiple DF proteins at the same time, the total concentration of siRNA in the final transfection mixture was maintained constant (i.e., silencing of DF1 , DF2 , and DF3 was performed by adding 10 nM of siRNAs targeting DF1 , 10 nM of siRNAs targeting DF2 and 10 nM of siRNAs targeting DF3 in the same transfection mixture, i.e., silencing of DF1 and DF2 was performed by adding 15 nM of siRNA for DF1 and 15 nM of siRNA for DF2 in the same transfection mixture). siRNA sequences were previously reported and validated ( Patil et al., 2016 47. Patil, D.P. ∙ Chen, C.-K. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ... m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Nature. 2016; 537 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ). Knockdown was also additionally validated prior to all experiments reported in this study by western blot. In each silencing condition, the siRNA sequences were specific to the DF paralog of interest.
MOLM-13 cells at a concentration of 500,000 cells ml -1 were transduced with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs against DF1, DF2, and DF3 or expressing a control scrambled shRNA sequence as performed previously ( Vu et al., 2017 60. Vu, L.P. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ∙ Cheng, Y. ... The N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A)-forming enzyme METTL3 controls myeloid differentiation of normal hematopoietic and leukemia cells Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1369-1376 Crossref Scopus (888) PubMed Google Scholar ). To increase the virus integration efficiency, cells were spinoculated at 1400 RPM for 1 h. After 24 h from the spinoculation (Day 1), cell media was changed. Cells were then collected 5 days after the transduction. shRNAs sequences against DF1, DF2 , and DF3 were previously reported ( Ries et al., 2019 51. Ries, R.J. ∙ Zaccara, S. ∙ Klein, P. ... m 6 A enhances the phase separation potential of mRNA Nature. 2019; 571 :424-428 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to obtain at least two shRNAs for each DF, additional MISSION shRNA plasmid DNA sequences were purchased from Sigma (DF2 shRNA: TRCN000254410, DF3 shRNA: TCN000365173). EGFP/TGFP expression was used to select efficiently transduced cells by FACS sorting.
HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-3xHA-tagged DF1, FLAG-3xHA-tagged DF2 and FLAG-3xHA-tagged DF3-expressing plasmids using Fugene HD Transfection Reagent (E2311, Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. As control, a FLAG-3xHA-expressing plasmid was used as control. Briefly, cells were plated on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes coated with 1% gelatin and allowed to reach 40%–60% confluency before transfection. 24 h after transfection, plates were fixed, and immunostaining was performed as described. To visualize the overexpressed DF, staining using an antibody against each DF paralog and the HA tag was performed. Areas where the HA staining overlaps with the DF staining indicate the localization of the FLAG-3xHA-tagged DF. After antibody staining, images were acquired using a Nikon TE-2000 inverted microscope with a 40x oil objective.
For in vitro binding affinity studies of m 6 A-modified RNA to DF paralogs, each full-length DF paralog was purified in bacteria as previously described ( Patil et al., 2016; Ries et al., 2019 47. Patil, D.P. ∙ Chen, C.-K. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ... m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Nature. 2016; 537 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Ries, R.J. ∙ Zaccara, S. ∙ Klein, P. ... m 6 A enhances the phase separation potential of mRNA Nature. 2019; 571 :424-428 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, DF proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen) using pProEx HTb (Invitrogen) with checking every 20 min at 600nm (OD 600 ) until the culture reached log phase (04-0.6 OD 600 ). DF protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16 h at 18 °C. Cells were collected, pelleted and then resuspended in the following buffer: 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.2, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole at pH 7.2 and supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (05892791001, Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were lysed by sonication and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min. The soluble protein was purified using Talon Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech) and eluted in the following buffer: 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.2, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole-HCl at pH 7.2. Further concentration and buffer exchange were performed using Amicon Ultra-4 spin columns (Merck-Millipore) when proteins were not directly labeled. Recombinant protein was stored in the following buffer: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl 2 , 0.02% NP40, 50% glycerol at −80 °C or 20% glycerol at −20 °C. All protein purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The purified protein was quantified using a ND-2000C NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies) with OD 280 and verified by Coomassie staining.
After 5 days of DF silencing, MOLM-13 cells were tested for the expression of the CD14 differentiation marker using the following protocol. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 1X PBS+2% FBS and then counted using a hemocytometer. One million cells were used to perform cellular staining using PE-CD14 antibody (BD PharMingen). The antibody dilution was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Staining was performed on ice for 1 h. After the staining, excess unbound antibody was removed by two washes with 1x PBS. DAPI was added prior to analysis. Cells were analyzed on a BD FACS ARIA instrument. To calculate the percentage of CD14 positive cells, data were processed using FlowJo.
HeLa cells were seeded on coated no 1.5H (170μm ± 5μm) coverslip (474030-9000-000, Carl Zeiss) in 6 well-plates. Coverslips were coated with gelatin prior to seeding. 24 h after seeding, cells were washed twice with PBS at 25°C and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 1X PBS for 15 min at 25°C. After two washes with 1X PBS to remove the excess of formaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with permeabilization/blocking buffer (1x FBS, 1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. Following permeabilization/blocking, cells were incubated with the primary antibody in a humidified chamber for 2 h. Cells were then washed with 1x PBS for three times and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568, anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488) for 1 h at room temperature. Following the incubation, cells were washed as before. Hoechst staining was performed for 5 min. After additional washes, coverslips were mounted in mounting media (Prolong Diamond, P36961, Life Technologies) and quickly sealed with nail polish. Stained cells were imaged by super-resolution 3D-SIM on OMX Blaze 3D-SIM super-resolution microscope (Applied Precision) equipped with a 100x/1.40 UPLSAPO oil objective. To reduce spherical aberrations, an oil with the optimal refractive index was first identified at the beginning of every acquisition session. Image reconstruction and alignment was performed using SoftWoRx. Because all acquired images have AF-568 staining (red staining), Optimal-Red transfer functions (OTFs) were used during the image processing. Further processing was performed on Imaris.
HeLa cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes. At 70%–80% confluency, cells were treated with 100 μg/mL cycloheximide for 10 min at 37°C and then collected. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS in mild cycloheximide condition and then lysed directly on the dish using 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 2 mM DTT, 1x cOmplete no EDTA protease inhibitor cocktail). The lysate was then left on ice for 10 min and then a centrifugation at 12,000 g x 15 min was performed to clear the lysate. The cleared lysates were then loaded in 15%–50% linear sucrose gradients, ultra-centrifuged and fractionated with an automated fraction collector. Proteins were extracted from each fraction using trichloroacetic acid. Sodium deoxycholate was added as a carrier to assist in the protein precipitation. After acetone addition and washes, proteins were resuspended in protein loading buffer, denatured at 95°C for 10 min, and used for detecting DF1, DF2, DF3 and RPS6 by western blot. RNA was extracted from each fraction using TRIzol-LS reagent (Invitrogen). To account for differences in extraction efficiency, 2 ng of a spike-in luciferase mRNA (TriLink Biotechnologies) was added to each fraction before RNA extraction. Briefly, RNA extraction was performed using a ratio of 2:1 between the volume of TRIzol LS reagent and the sample. After TRIzol addition, RNA isolation was performed as indicated by the manual’s instructions.
Ribosome profiling was performed following the original protocol ( McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017 38. McGlincy, N.J. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Transcriptome-wide measurement of translation by ribosome profiling Methods. 2017; 126 :112-129 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells were plated on a 10-cm dish and each DF or combination of DF transcripts was silenced as described. After the silencing, to inhibit ribosome run-off during the collection and lysis, cells were rapidly washed once with ice-cold PBS containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide and the plates were immersed in liquid nitrogen and placed in dried ice as previously described ( Calviello et al., 2016 8. Calviello, L. ∙ Mukherjee, N. ∙ Wyler, E. ... Detecting actively translated open reading frames in ribosome profiling data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :165-170 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). After allowing cells to reach 4°C by keeping cells on ice, cells were immediately lysed in 400 μL of cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 100 μg/mL cycloheximide, 1% Triton, 25 U DNase I) and by triturating the sample through a 26-gauge needle ten times to further lyse the cellular material. 5% of the total cellular extract was used for RNaseq library preparation. 10% of the total cellular extract was used for Western Blot validation of the silencing. Lysate was then clarified by performing a centrifugation step at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatant was collected, flash-frozen and stored at −80°C.
For the ribosome profiling library preparation, the RNA concentration in the cleared lysate was quantified using RiboGreen. 30 μg of RNA was digested using RNase I (Epicenter) as previously described ( McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017 38. McGlincy, N.J. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Transcriptome-wide measurement of translation by ribosome profiling Methods. 2017; 126 :112-129 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). After RNase digestion, lysates were loaded on a sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm (TLA 100.3 rotor) for 1 h to pellet ribosomes. RNA from the resuspended ribosomal pellet was purified using Trizol and run on a gel to selectively excise foot-printed RNAs (from 17 nt to 34 nt in length). To reduce ribosomal contamination in the library preparation steps, we then performed Ribo Zero Gold depletion of the foot-printed RNA. The rRNA-depleted RNA fragments were dephosphorylated, and the adaptor was ligated. To specifically deplete unligated linker, yeast 5′-deadenylase and RecJ exonuclease digestion was performed. At this point, the library preparation steps were performed essentially as described previously ( McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017 38. McGlincy, N.J. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Transcriptome-wide measurement of translation by ribosome profiling Methods. 2017; 126 :112-129 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript III. To avoid untemplated nucleotide addition, reverse transcription was carried out at 57°C, as described ( McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017 38. McGlincy, N.J. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Transcriptome-wide measurement of translation by ribosome profiling Methods. 2017; 126 :112-129 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). cDNA purification, circularization, and amplification were performed as previously described ( Linder et al., 2015 33. Linder, B. ∙ Grozhik, A.V. ∙ Olarerin-George, A.O. ... Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :767-772 Crossref Scopus (1095) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using this method, every ribosomal footprint represents a unique ribosome-binding event. Libraries were sequenced with a single end 50 bp run using an Illumina Hiseq2500 platform.
For the RNaseq library preparation, the RNA was extracted from the 5% of the lysate before the RNase digestion using Trizol LS. The RNA quality was assessed by Bioanalyzer analysis. 1 μg of total RNA was used for library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit. Ribosomal RNA was removed using NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit. The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument, in single read mode, 50 bases per read.
HeLa cells were plated on a 10-cm dish and each DF or combination of DF proteins was silenced as described. After five days of silencing, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of actinomycin D or vehicle (DMSO) for 2 h to inhibit transcription. To ensure that the treatment did not affect cell viability, cells were counted before collection. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol and 1 μg of total RNA was used to perform RNA-seq library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit. Ribosomal RNA was removed using NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit. Prior to ribosomal depletion, 2 μL of the 1:100 dilution of the ERCC (external RNA control consortium) RNA Spike-in Control Mix 1 was added to each 1 μg of total RNA sample, as suggested by the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each condition, the same amount of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript IV First-Strand kit. When the transcript abundance was tested upon actinomycin D treatment in HeLa cells, oligo-dT primers were used during the cDNA synthesis step. This allowed us to selectively convert to cDNA the amount of intact RNA still present in cells upon actinomycin D treatment, while avoiding the conversion of fragmented RNA to cDNA. When transcript abundance was tested in MOLM13 cells, random hexamers were used. Quantitative qPCR was performed using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix with 200nM primers in 10 μL final reaction mix. For the amplification, the following protocol was used: 98°C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 45 s. To test primer specificity, melting curves were performed at the end of the 40 cycles of amplification. A delta cycle threshold (Ct) was calculated using the average Ct values across technical triplicates, by subtracting the geometric mean of a control non-m 6 A gene ( RPS28 ). To test the distribution of the mRNA levels along the sucrose gradient, for each fraction, equal volume of extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA. The list of primers used for qPCR is presented in Table S4 .
10 μM of each recombinant DF paralog expressed in E. coli was labeled with RES-NHS dye using the Monolith Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS 2 nd Generation (Amine Reactive) following the protocol instructions. Prior to each MST run, protein aggregation was minimized by centrifuging the protein solutions at 20,820 × g for 10 min. A constant concentration (50 nM) of each DF paralog was mixed with increasing concentration of the m 6 A-modified RNA (rUrCrCrGrG/iN6Me-rA/rCrUrGrU, IDT) in MST buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, samples were loaded onto Premium Coated capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies) for MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) acquisition. The MST measurements were performed at room temperature using a fixed IR-laser power of 40% for 20 s per capillary, using an LED power of 20% in a red laser equipped Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies) (HTSRC, Rockefeller University). The MonoTemper analysis software (NanoTemper Technologies) was used to determine K D values.
Data related to Figure 2 B were previously reported in a recent Bio-ID interactome study in which the DF proteins were analyzed among 139 other proteins ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). This analysis was performed using two C-terminal labeling experiments for DF1, two N-terminal and two C-terminal labeling-experiments for DF2 and DF3. “Table S1” of the Bio-ID interactome study was used to select the number of spectra counts, the number of performed replicates, the level of confidence of each DF1, DF2 and DF3 interactor. As determined in the study ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ), only proteins with an average probability of interaction of 0.95 were considered as high-confidence interactors. In the Youn et al. (2018) 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar study, 0.95 was considered as an optimal cut-off for high-confidence interactors as it was well above the Bayesian 1% FDR estimation (corresponding to an AvgP of 0.91) and as decreasing the threshold resulted in no worthwhile gains in BioGRID-curated interactions for the drop-in sensitivity. The list of top 25 interacting proteins is also provided in Table S1 of the same Bio-ID interactome study. “Table S7” of the same Bio-ID interactome study ( Youn et al., 2018 71. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to define the NMF analysis-based association of each DF protein presented in Figure 2 C. The 14 subcellular compartments are: 1. RNP granule (cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granule), 2. chromosome, 3. ER (Endoplasmic reticulum), 4. RNP complex (ribonucleoprotein complex), 5. nucleolus, 6. plasma membrane, 7. mitochondrion, 8. P-body (CCR4-NOT complex/P-body), 9. stress granules, 10. cytoskeleton, 11. nucleus, 12. vesicles, 13. MOC (microtubule organizing center), 14. snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex/spliceosomal complex).
The disordered region score was calculated using D 2 P 2 ( Oates et al., 2013 42. Oates, M.E. ∙ Romero, P. ∙ Ishida, T. ...

The prion-like likelihood ratio was calculated using PLAAC ( Lancaster et al., 2014 26. Lancaster, A.K. ∙ Nutter-Upham, A. ∙ Lindquist, S. ... PLAAC: a web and command-line application to identify proteins with prion-like amino acid composition Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2501-2502 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). The net charge per residue, and the probability of charged residues, were calculated in a sliding window of 10 amino acids using CIDER ( Holehouse et al., 2017 23. Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Das, R.K. ∙ Ahad, J.N. ... CIDER: Resources to Analyze Sequence-Ensemble Relationships of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Biophys. J. 2017; 112 :16-21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hydrophobicity analysis was performed using ProtScale (ExPASy) in a sliding window of 10 amino acids.
Data from the DF3 PAR-CLIP (GEO: GSE86214 ) were downloaded and used for analysis in this study. Reads processing was performed using Flexbar ( Dodt et al., 2012 16. Dodt, M. ∙ Roehr, J.T. ∙ Ahmed, R. ... FLEXBAR-Flexible Barcode and Adapter Processing for Next-Generation Sequencing Platforms Biology (Basel). 2012; 1 :895-905 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, the adaptor sequence reported on the GEO submission was removed using the following set-up: flexbar -r SRR509926X.fastq -f i1.8 -t SRR509926X.noadapter–max-uncalled 1 -a adapters_par-clip.fasta–pre-trim-phred 20 -n 20–min-read-length 1. After the adaptor removal, quality read analysis check was performed using Fastqc ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ). According to the Fastqc results, 40% of the reads of each DF3 PAR-CLIP library replicate was represented by the following sequence: CTCAACACCCACTACCTAAAAAATCCCAAACATATAACTGAACTCCTCAC. By using the BLAT analysis tool, we found that the sequence had 100% sequence identity to MT-RNR2 , the mitochondrially encoded 16S ribosomal RNA. This sequence is likely to represent a contaminant of the library preparation procedure. The removal of this sequence and any other PCR duplicate was performed using the CIMS/fastq2collapse.pl script. Reads shorter than 18 nucleotides were then removed by using Flexbar with the default–min-read-length option ( Dodt et al., 2012 16. Dodt, M. ∙ Roehr, J.T. ∙ Ahmed, R. ... FLEXBAR-Flexible Barcode and Adapter Processing for Next-Generation Sequencing Platforms Biology (Basel). 2012; 1 :895-905 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). The remaining reads were aligned to the human genome ( H. sapiens , NCBI GRCh38) using Bowtie version 1 and the reported parameters in the GEO submission data processing description (-v 2 -m 5).
Data from the DF1 and DF2 PAR-CLIP datasets were analyzed similarly. For DF1, the original PAR-CLIP sequencing data were downloaded from GEO: GSE63591 . For DF2, the original PAR-CLIP sequencing data were download from GEO: GSE49339 . In this case, when we performed the quality check using Fastqc, we did not find any over-represented sequences representing more than 5% of the library. Thus, after removing low-quality nucleotides, the adaptor sequence, short reads, and duplicates, the remaining reads were aligned to the human genome ( H. sapiens , NCBI GRCh38) using Bowtie version 1 and the reported parameters in the GEO submission data processing description (-v 2 -m 5).
To visualize the aligned reads and comparing them across the different PAR-CLIP datasets, we calculated the number of reads counts normalized to the millions of mapped reads at every coordinate on the human genome. In this case, every single read does not represent a unique event of RNA-protein interaction since libraries were prepared using a Truseq small RNA sample preparation kit without the use of unique molecular identifiers. Therefore, PCR duplicates cannot be distinguished from distinct binding events.
To compare iCLIP coverage at each m 6 A site, we calculated the number of normalized DF iCLIP read counts at each m 6 A site using a previously described approach ( Patil et al., 2016 47. Patil, D.P. ∙ Chen, C.-K. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ... m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Nature. 2016; 537 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first calculated the number of unique read counts per million mapped reads obtained from the CITS analysis of each iCLIP dataset ( Patil et al., 2016 47. Patil, D.P. ∙ Chen, C.-K. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ... m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Nature. 2016; 537 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this approach, each iCLIP read represents a unique RNA-bound protein. Only m 6 A mapping to mRNAs were used in this analysis. A 5-nucleotide window from the m 6 A site genomic coordinate was selected and the number of iCLIP reads per million uniquely mapped reads was calculated at every m 6 A coordinate using BEDTools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 49. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15098) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following formula was used: (r ∗ 10 6 )/R where r = number of unique CLIP reads at the m 6 A window, R = total number of uniquely mapped unique iCLIP reads in the whole iCLIP library. We refer to the resulting number as “coverage at each m 6 A site” throughout the manuscript. For comparing the reanalyzed DF1 and DF2 PAR-CLIP coverage at each m 6 A site, we used a similar approach. For each DF1, DF2 and DF3 iCLIP and miCLIP, the enriched motif presented in Figure 1 was obtained using MEME suite ( Bailey et al., 2009 5. Bailey, T.L. ∙ Boden, M. ∙ Buske, F.A. ... MEME SUITE: tools for motif discovery and searching Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 W202-8 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ) as previously described ( Patil et al., 2016 47. Patil, D.P. ∙ Chen, C.-K. ∙ Pickering, B.F. ... m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Nature. 2016; 537 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For representation of iCLIP, PAR-CLIP and miCLIP tracks in Figure 1 and Figure S1 , the normalized number of read counts from iCLIP, PAR-CLIP and miCLIP datasets at the indicated genomic coordinate is presented. The reported annotated m 6 A sites in the respective GEO submission were downloaded (GEO: GSE86336 , GSE63753 ). In order to calculate the number of m 6 A sites per transcript, m 6 A sites were assigned to the gene transcript using MetaplotR ( Olarerin-George and Jaffrey, 2017 43. Olarerin-George, A.O. ∙ Jaffrey, S.R. MetaPlotR: a Perl/R pipeline for plotting metagenes of nucleotide modifications and other transcriptomic sites Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :1563-1564 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To select the previously described DF1-uniquely bound sites and DF2-uniquely bound sites, we first obtained the list of genes considered unique DF1 and DF2 targets from Shi et al., 2017. Next, the subset of called DF1 or DF2 sites on these targets were selected from the entire list of called sites reported in supplementary file “GSE63591_A-Y1-PARCLIP.xlsx” (GEO: GSE63591 ), and in the supplementary file “GSE49339_A-PARCLIP.xlsx.gz” (GEO: GSE49339 ). The number of DF1 and DF2 normalized coverage at each site was calculated using deepTools bamCoverage (parameters:–binSize 50–effectiveGenomeSize–normalizeUsing BPM). To compare the two calculated coverage, deepTools bamCompare was used and visualized using deepTools plotHeatmap ( Ramírez et al., 2016 50. Ramírez, F. ∙ Ryan, D.P. ∙ Grüning, B. ... deepTools2: a next generation web server for deep-sequencing data analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W160-5 Crossref Scopus (1768) PubMed Google Scholar ).
After the sequencing of the ribosome profiling libraries performed in this study, reads were quality-based trimmed and reads below 16 nucleotides were excluded. The adaptor was removed using Flexbar ( Dodt et al., 2012 16. Dodt, M. ∙ Roehr, J.T. ∙ Ahmed, R. ... FLEXBAR-Flexible Barcode and Adapter Processing for Next-Generation Sequencing Platforms Biology (Basel). 2012; 1 :895-905 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). The demultiplexing was performed based on the experimental barcode using the pyBarcodeFilter.py script. The second part of the random barcode was then moved to the read header. After removal of the PCR duplicates based on the UMI sequence, ribosomal RNA reads were removed using STAR aligner ( Dobin et al., 2013 15. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ). As previously reported, a high percentage of reads in the library is represented by ribosomal RNA. To avoid possible contamination of the reads representing the Ago-complex recruited on the siRNA target sequence, reads were also mapped to the siRNA sequences to remove these sequences. siRNA sequences are previously described and reported in the GEO submission related to this previous study. Reads with no acceptable alignment to ribosomal and siRNA sequences were then mapped to the hg38 transcriptome. The STAR genome index was built using the annotation obtained from GENCODE (version 26). The following parameters were used to align to the genome: STAR–runThreadN 20–genomeDir ./star_hg38–readFilesIn reads_rRNA_siRNA_Unmapped.fastq–outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate–sjdbGTFfile gencode.v26.protein_coding.annotation.gtf–outFilterMultimapNmax 8–limitBAMsortRAM 10000000000–alignEndsType EndtoEnd–outWigType bedGraph–outWigStrand Stranded–outWigNorm None–quantMode TranscriptomeSAM GeneCounts–outFilterMismatchNmax 8–outSAMattributes All–outFilterIntronMotifs RemoveNoncanonicalUnannotated. These parameters were previously used ( Calviello et al., 2016 8. Calviello, L. ∙ Mukherjee, N. ∙ Wyler, E. ... Detecting actively translated open reading frames in ribosome profiling data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :165-170 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mapped reads that represent ribosome-protected fragments (reads longer than 21 nucleotides, but shorter than 32 nucleotides) with a 40% minimum level of periodicity were considered for the subsequent analysis. We specifically considered only ribosome-protected fragments reads mapped to the coding sequence to avoid any possible contamination coming from the untranslated area of the genome. To measure the degree to which transcripts are translated independently from the initiation and termination rate, we excluded reads mapping to the first 15 nucleotides from the start codon and the 9 nucleotides before the stop codon of each coding sequence, as recommended in previous studies ( Lauria et al., 2018 28. Lauria, F. ∙ Tebaldi, T. ∙ Bernabò, P. ... riboWaltz: Optimization of ribosome P-site positioning in ribosome profiling data PLoS Comput. Biol. 2018; 14 :e1006169 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). To precisely determine the localization of each ribosome with respect to the start and stop codon, the P-site offset was estimated as previously described using riboWaltz ( Lauria et al., 2018 28. Lauria, F. ∙ Tebaldi, T. ∙ Bernabò, P. ... riboWaltz: Optimization of ribosome P-site positioning in ribosome profiling data PLoS Comput. Biol. 2018; 14 :e1006169 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads matching all these criteria were considered to determine the number of ribosome-protected fragments per gene. Given the level of variability and the possibility of contamination of the ribosome profiling library preparation, all these criteria have been reported as essential analysis steps to better estimate the number of ribosome-protected fragments mapped to each transcript ( Calviello et al., 2016; McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017 8. Calviello, L. ∙ Mukherjee, N. ∙ Wyler, E. ... Detecting actively translated open reading frames in ribosome profiling data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :165-170 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar 38. McGlincy, N.J. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Transcriptome-wide measurement of translation by ribosome profiling Methods. 2017; 126 :112-129 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only the longest splice isoform of each gene was considered. Genes with less than 10 ribosome-protected fragments were excluded from the analysis. For each DF paralog silencing experiment, TMM normalization, empirical Bayes estimate of the negative binomial dispersion, and measurement of the level of change in translation (log 2 Fold Change) compared to the control condition was performed using edgeR ( McCarthy et al., 2012 37. McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. Differential expression analysis of multifactor RNA-Seq experiments with respect to biological variation Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :4288-4297 Crossref Scopus (3388) PubMed Google Scholar ). To account for sample-to-sample variability, all replicates were analyzed at the same time to define a unique log 2 Fold Change measurement.
After the sequencing of the RNA-seq libraries, reads with low quality were discarded and read lengths shorter than 18 nt were discarded. Ribosomal reads were removed using STAR aligner. The remaining reads were mapped to hg38 genome using STAR and the data were used to normalize the Riboseq data and derive the change in RNaseq expression. For each DF paralog silencing, TMM normalization, empirical Bayes estimate of the negative binomial dispersion, and measurement of the level of change in translation (log 2 Fold Change) compared to the control condition was performed using edgeR. To account for sample to sample variability, all replicates were analyzed at the same time to define a unique log 2 Fold Change measurement.
For the translational efficiency measurement, the Riboseq change was compared to the RNaseq change.
To analyze the public available ribosome profiling data upon DF1 silencing, we used two independent approaches. First, we downloaded the Table “GSE63591_C-Y1-Ribosome_profiling.xlsx” available at the GEO: GSE63591 and assigned to each reported transcript a number of m 6 A sites. To define whether m 6 A mRNAs were affected by the DF1 silencing, we used the translational efficiency values reported in the table without performing any further processing step. Secondarily, the original sequencing data of the GEO: GSE63591 were downloaded and processed as follow. Quality check was performed using Flexbar. After quality check, sequences longer than 21 nt were first mapped to the siRNA sequences reported in the published study ( Wang et al., 2015 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ), to the ribosomal RNA, and then to the hg38 transcriptome. All mapping steps were performed using STAR as mentioned above. Reads mapping to the coding sequence that represent ribosome protected fragments and have high level of periodicity were considered for the analysis steps as described above. We excluded reads mapping to the first 5 codons from the start codon and the 3 codons before the stop codon of each coding sequence as described above.
We noticed a major difference between the original public available table and the new tables generated by our reanalysis. In the case of Replicate 2, the number of ribosome-protected fragments assigned to the DF1 mRNA in the processed table by Wang et al. (2015) 64. Wang, X. ∙ Zhao, B.S. ∙ Roundtree, I.A. ... N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency Cell. 2015; 161 :1388-1399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar showed a significant reduction in the number of ribosome-protected fragments for the DF1 -silenced sample compared to the matching control sample. This is expected for the DF1 knockdown condition. When we reanalyzed the original sequences reads from GEO: GSE63591 , we reproduced this loss of ribosome-protected fragments assigned to DF1 upon DF1 silencing. In contrast, the number of ribosome-protected fragments assigned to the DF1 mRNA in Replicate 1, as shown in the processed table “GSE63591_C-Y1-Ribosome_profiling.xlsx,” shows a substantially higher number of ribosome-protected fragments for the DF1 -silenced sample compared to the matching control sample (15-fold increase). This would indicate a condition of overexpression instead of knockdown. We therefore examined the raw sequencing reads for Replicate 1 to generate a new table of ribosome-protected fragments. Upon reanalysis of the Replicate 1 ribosome-profiling data ( Table S2 ), the number of ribosome-protected fragments mapped to DF1 mRNA was significantly lower than the number indicated in the published processed table “GSE63591_C-Y1-Ribosome_profiling.xlsx.” In the reanalysis, we observed 98% less ribosome-protected fragments mapped to DF1 than the number of ribosome-protected fragments mapped to DF1 in the matching control sample. This is consistent with the raw data representing a DF1 knockdown condition rather than an overexpression condition.
We used a standard protocol for determining ribosome-protected reads, which inherently discards any reads that derive from the siRNA itself because these fragments would be too short to be a ribosome-protected fragment, as described above ( Calviello et al., 2016; McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017 8. Calviello, L. ∙ Mukherjee, N. ∙ Wyler, E. ... Detecting actively translated open reading frames in ribosome profiling data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :165-170 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar 38. McGlincy, N.J. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Transcriptome-wide measurement of translation by ribosome profiling Methods. 2017; 126 :112-129 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is possible that the large number of ribosome-protected fragments that map to DF1 in the published processed table for Replicate 1 derive from DF1 -specific siRNA molecules that were cloned into the library but not removed, if there was no appropriate size filter used in the alignment protocol. The length, sequence and alignment position of each ribosome protected fragment is not provided in the processed table. Alternatively, the ribosome-protected reads assigned to DF1 could derive from a sample which contains overexpressed DF1 mRNA. Because of this uncertainty, we generated new DF1 knockdown ribosome profiling datasets in the same cell line. The pipeline used for the reanalysis of these datasets is reported (see “ Data and Code Availability ”).
The stability of m 6 A-modified mRNAs and non-methylated mRNAs was determined by quantifying mRNA levels immediately before and 2 h after actinomycin D treatment. After sequencing, libraries were checked for their quality as previously described for all RNA-seq libraries in this study. Reads were then mapped to the transcriptome using STAR aligner. A read count table was generated using the STAR aligner as well. ERCC Spike-in reads were also mapped using STAR aligner. Thus, the resulting read counts table contains reads mapping to the ERCC RNA Spike-in as well. To remove unwanted variation, the RUVg estimation package was used ( Risso et al., 2014 52. Risso, D. ∙ Ngai, J. ∙ Speed, T.P. ... Normalization of RNA-seq data using factor analysis of control genes or samples Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :896-902 Crossref Scopus (1185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, edgeR was used to calculate ERCC spike-in RNA size factors for each sample, which were then applied to normalize for library size changes in each replicate. We thus obtained a final number of normalized reads mapped to each mRNA. Since m 6 A mRNAs are known to have a short half-life (2 to 4 h) ( Geula et al., 2015; Ke et al., 2017; Schwartz et al., 2014 19. Geula, S. ∙ Moshitch-Moshkovitz, S. ∙ Dominissini, D. ... Stem cells. m6A mRNA methylation facilitates resolution of naïve pluripotency toward differentiation Science. 2015; 347 :1002-1006 Crossref Scopus (1217) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Ke, S. ∙ Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ Saito, Y. ... m 6 A mRNA modifications are deposited in nascent pre-mRNA and are not required for splicing but do specify cytoplasmic turnover Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :990-1006 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Schwartz, S. ∙ Mumbach, M.R. ∙ Jovanovic, M. ... Perturbation of m6A writers reveals two distinct classes of mRNA methylation at internal and 5′ sites Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :284-296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (938) PubMed Google Scholar ), m 6 A mRNA expressions are often substantially reduced even at 2 h after actinomycin D treatment. We focused on mRNAs in which the reduction in expression level could be accurately measured, i.e., those mRNAs that showed a reduction in expression level by at least 40% after 2 h of actinomycin D treatment. The percentage of mRNA abundance reduction was calculated in both the control samples (control siRNA) and in the samples subjected to DF paralog knockdown. In some cases, the stabilization of the mRNA was very substantial upon depletion of all three DF paralogs, and the mRNA expression reduction was less than 10%. Since these mRNAs no longer show a drop in mRNA expression, it is difficult to precisely establish the fold change in mRNA stability. Therefore, we simply assigned the reduction at 10% for these mRNAs in the calculations used in Figure 3 F.
