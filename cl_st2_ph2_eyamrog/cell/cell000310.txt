Title: Structural insights into the human D1 and D2 dopamine receptor signaling complexes


Abstract: Summary

The D1- and D2-dopamine receptors (D1R and D2R), which signal through G s and G i , respectively, represent the principal stimulatory and inhibitory dopamine receptors in the central nervous system. D1R and D2R also represent the main therapeutic targets for Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and many other neuropsychiatric disorders, and insight into their signaling is essential for understanding both therapeutic and side effects of dopaminergic drugs. Here, we report four cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of D1R-G s and D2R-G i signaling complexes with selective and non-selective dopamine agonists, including two currently used anti-Parkinson’s disease drugs, apomorphine and bromocriptine. These structures, together with mutagenesis studies, reveal the conserved binding mode of dopamine agonists, the unique pocket topology underlying ligand selectivity, the conformational changes in receptor activation, and potential structural determinants for G protein-coupling selectivity. These results provide both a molecular understanding of dopamine signaling and multiple structural templates for drug design targeting the dopaminergic system.

Section: Introduction

Dopamine is a catecholamine neurotransmitter with important functions for both the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. Dopaminergic functions are mediated by a family of five G-protein-coupled receptors, which are divided into two groups: the D1-like and the D2-like receptors ( Figure 1 A). The D1-like group, including D1R and D5R, primarily couple to the stimulatory G protein G s , whereas the D2-like group, including D2R, D3R, and D4R, primarily couple to the inhibitory G protein G i/o . Among the five dopamine receptors, D1R and D2R are the most abundant receptors in the CNS, especially in the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex ( Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011 5.

Aberrant D1R and D2R signaling has been associated with many neuropsychiatric diseases including Parkinson’s disease (PD), schizophrenia, various types of cognitive impairment, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drug abuse, and autism ( Abi-Dargham et al., 2002 1.

Activation of dopaminergic pathways through D1R and D2R has been proposed to mediate various aspects of the reinforcing and rewarding properties of many abused drugs ( Di Chiara et al., 2004 15. Di Chiara, G. ∙ Bassareo, V. ∙ Fenu, S. ...

Given the centrality of the dopaminergic system, many ligands targeting D1R and D2R have been developed for treating diverse CNS disorders by maintaining normal dopaminergic homeostasis and restoring homeostasis in disease states.
Due to the high homology of dopamine receptors, most dopaminergic drugs are highly polypharmacologic because they frequently target multiple dopamine receptors and other aminergic GPCRs ( Butini et al., 2016 7. Butini, S. ∙ Nikolic, K. ∙ Kassel, S. ... Polypharmacology of dopamine receptor ligands Prog. Neurobiol. 2016; 142 :68-103 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roth et al., 2004 46.

Drug Discov. 2004; 3 :353-359 Crossref Scopus (1031) PubMed Google Scholar ). Non-selective dopamine agonists, including PD drugs apomorphine ( Di Chiara and Gessa, 1978 14. Di Chiara, G. ∙ Gessa, G.L. Pharmacology and neurochemistry of apomorphine Adv. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1978; 15 :87-160 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ) and bromocriptine ( Parkes et al., 1976 38. Parkes, J.D. ∙ Marsden, C.D. ∙ Donaldson, I. ... Bromocriptine treatment in Parkinson’s disease J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1976; 39 :184-193 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), have been proposed to be more effective than selective drugs for treating complex CNS diseases ( Roth et al., 2004 46. Roth, B.L. ∙ Sheffler, D.J. ∙ Kroeze, W.K. Magic shotguns versus magic bullets: selectively non-selective drugs for mood disorders and schizophrenia Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3 :353-359 Crossref Scopus (1031) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, highly selective dopamine receptor ligands are important pharmacological tools for functional investigation. The first selective ligands of D1R were phenyl benzazepine derivatives, including the SKF compounds (e.g., SKF81297 and SKF83959) as D1R agonists and the D1R antagonist SCH23390, which have been used for decades to study D1R pharmacology and physiology ( Hall et al., 2019 20. Hall, A. ∙ Provins, L. ∙ Valade, A. Novel Strategies To Activate the Dopamine D 1 Receptor: Recent Advances in Orthosteric Agonism and Positive Allosteric Modulation J. Med.

To date, no D1R structure has been reported. Several crystal structures of antagonist-bound D2R, D3R, and D4R and a 3.7 Å structure of a thermostabilized D2R-G i complex bound to bromocriptine have been reported ( Chien et al., 2010 10.

The lack of D1R structures has impeded both our understanding of the molecular basis of D1R signaling and our ability to prosecute structure-guided drug discovery at D1R. In addition, the thermostabilized D2R-G i complex contains thermostabilizing mutations and truncation of intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) in D2R, making it difficult to rationalize the relevance of ligand binding mode, TM conformations, and G protein coupling characteristics to the wild-type D2R. Here, we report four cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human D1R-G s and D2R-G i protein complexes: three structures of the wild-type D1R-G s complexes, either with the pan dopamine agonist drug apomorphine at a global resolution of 3.0 Å, or with D1R/D5R-selective catechol agonists SKF81297 and SKF83959 at a global resolution of 3.0 Å and 2.9 Å, respectively, and one structure of the human wild-type D2R-G i complex with the D2R/D3R agonist drug bromocriptine at a global resolution of 2.8 Å. These structures reveal the basis for agonist selectivity, G protein selectivity, and receptor activation at D1R and D2R. The structures also provide multiple templates for rational design of dopaminergic ligands aimed for treating CNS diseases.

Section: Results and discussion

For cryo-EM studies, we fused the wild-type human D1R (referred as WT D1R hereafter) to a prolactin signal peptide, followed by FLAG and 8× His tags for expression and purification ( Figure S1 ). We co-expressed D1R with a dominant negative form of human G αs containing two mutations (G226A and A366S) ( Liu et al., 2016 31. Liu, P. ∙ Jia, M.Z. ∙ Zhou, X.E. ...

An engineered miniG αs construct based on the previously reported miniG αs sequence ( Carpenter et al., 2016 8. Carpenter, B. ∙ Nehmé, R. ∙ Warne, T. ...

A single-chain antibody, Nb35, was added to stabilize the nucleotide-free D1R-G s complexes ( Rasmussen et al., 2011b 42. Rasmussen, S.G. ∙ DeVree, B.T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex Nature. 2011; 477 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (2447) PubMed Google Scholar ). To obtain the human D2R-G i complex bound to bromocriptine, we co-expressed the full-length human D2R long form ( Giros et al., 1989 19. Giros, B. ∙ Sokoloff, P. ∙ Martres, M.P. ...

Sci. 2018; 1 :12-20 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ), the rat G β1 , and bovine G γ2 in Sf9 insect cells. The single-chain antibody fragment scFv16 was added to stabilize the nucleotide-free bromocriptine-D2R-G i complex ( Koehl et al., 2018 23. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the μ-opioid receptor-G i protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar ). All complexes were purified to homogeneity for single-particle cryo-EM analysis ( Figure S1 ).
The structures of SKF81297-, SKF83959-, and apomorphine-bound D1R-G s complexes were determined with global resolutions of 3.0 Å, 2.9 Å, and 3.0 Å, respectively ( Figures 1 B, S2 , S3 , and S4 ; Table S1 ). The relatively high resolution density maps of the three complexes allowed us to clearly model most portions of D1R from residues S21 to Y348, the entire molecules of SKF81297, SKF83959, apomorphine, the G s heterotrimer, and Nb35 ( Figures 1 B, 1C, S3 , and S4 ). In addition, several putative cholesterol molecules and lipid acyl chains were modeled surrounding the D1R transmembrane domain (TMD) ( Figures S2 A–S2C), the corresponding densities could be either cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) or cholesterol, but were modeled as cholesterol. In all three structures, the N-terminal region preceding TM1 and ICL3 of D1R and the α-helical domain (AHD) of G αs were poorly observed and not modeled due to their flexibilities, which is consistent with most GPCR-G protein complex structures reported to date.
The structure of the D2R-G i complex bound to bromocriptine in detergent was determined at a global resolution of 2.8 Å with a much improved density map compared to the previously reported 3.7 Å cryo-EM structure of the thermostabilized D2R complexed with G i heterotrimer in lipid nanodiscs ( Figure S4 ), which provided an unambiguous modeling of most parts of the D2R, the G i protein, and bromocriptine ( Figures S2 D and S4 ). A majority of the side chains of D2R from Y34 to L441 were well defined except for a part of ICL3 (residues K226 to S364) ( Figures 1 D, S2 D, and S4 ). In particular, the structures of all three extracellular loops 1-3 (ECL1–ECL3) of D2R were clearly defined. Unlike the D1R-G s structures, there was no clear density of cholesterol and lipid molecules surrounding the transmembrane domain of D2R as was observed in the D2R-G i structure ( Figure S2 D).
Although the overall structure of the bromocriptine-bound D2R-G i complex is similar to the previously reported 3.7 Å structure of a thermostabilized D2R-G i complex bound to the same ligand reconstituted in the nanodiscs ( Yin et al., 2020 57. Yin, J. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Clark, M.J. ... Structure of a D2 dopamine receptor-G-protein complex in a lipid membrane Nature. 2020; 584 :125-129 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values of 0.9 Å for the Cα atoms of the whole complexes and 0.7 Å for the Cα atoms of D2R alone ( Figures 1 D and 2 A), several significant differences are observed between the two structures. These include a noticeable 2.4 Å shift at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 ( Figure 2 ) and a 6.7° difference in the orientation of α5 helix of G αi relative to the receptor ( Figure 2 ). In addition, the wild-type D2R structure displays a regular helical structure in the N-terminal half of TM1 instead of the 3 10 -like irregular helix in the thermostabilized D2R structure ( Figure 2 ). Interestingly, there is an ∼1–2 Å shift in the binding mode of bromocriptine in our structure compared to the previous structure, which is accompanied by different conformations of the surrounding residues including I184 ECL2 and W386 6.48 that play important roles in D2R activation ( Yin et al., 2020 57. Yin, J. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Clark, M.J. ... Structure of a D2 dopamine receptor-G-protein complex in a lipid membrane Nature. 2020; 584 :125-129 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 ). These differences between the two structures may be attributed to: (1) the stabilizing mutations and the truncation at ICL3 of the thermostabilized D2R used in the previous study ( Figure S5 ), (2) the different resolutions between the two structures, and (3) the different detergent and lipid environment of the D2R-G i complex used in the current and previous studies.
In all three D1R-G s complexes, D1R displays a canonical transmembrane domain (TMD) with a ligand binding pocket located at the extracellular side of the TMD and a G-protein binding cavity at the cytoplasmic side ( Figure 1 B). Apomorphine, SKF81297, and SKF83959 share common catechol motifs, with SKF83959 having two additional methyl groups as compared with SKF81297 ( Figure 1 B). The overall structures of D1R bound to three agonists are highly similar ( Figures 1 B and 1C), with RMSD values of 0.2 Å for the Cα atoms of D1R between SKF81297 and apomorphine-bound structures and 0.5 Å for the Cα atoms of D1R between SKF81297 and SKF83959-bound structures.
In the structures, SKF81297 and SKF83959 share nearly the identical binding poses, with a similar “L”-shape configuration, in which the phenyl group is extended toward extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and 3D). The benzazepine rings of SKF81297 and SKF83959 are located at the bottom of the orthosteric pocket, with the catechol group facing TM5 ( Figure 3 D). The benzazepine rings are sandwiched by TM3 on one side and by TM6/7 on the other, leading the amine group to form a close ionic interaction with the carboxylate group of D103 3.32 (superscript based on Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering rules of GPCRs ( Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995 4. Ballesteros, J.A. ∙ Weinstein, H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models and computational probing of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors Sealfon, S.C. (Editor) Methods in Neurosciences Elsevier, 1995; 366-428 Crossref Scopus (2650) Google Scholar )) from TM3, which is highly conserved among aminergic GPCRs ( Vass et al., 2019 50. Vass, M. ∙ Podlewska, S. ∙ de Esch, I.J.P. ... Aminergic GPCR-Ligand Interactions: A Chemical and Structural Map of Receptor Mutation Data J. Med. Chem. 2019; 62 :3784-3839 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 A and 3B). In both structures, the meta -hydroxyl from the catechol group forms hydrogen bonds with S198 5.43 , whereas the para -hydroxyl makes a hydrogen bond with N292 6.55 . In the SKF83959-bound D1R structure, the ligand is pushed closer toward TM5 due to an additional methyl group in the azepine ring, which is packed against W321 7.43 ( Figure 3 D). The para -hydroxyl group from SKF83959 makes another hydrogen bond with S198 5.43 , whereas the meta -hydroxyl group forms a direct hydrogen bond with S202 5.46 , which is absent in the SKF81297-bound D1R structure ( Figure 3 D). The extensive network of polar interactions by SKF81297 and SKF83959 may explain their high affinities for D1R. Besides the polar interaction network, the three ring structures of SKF81297 and SKF83959 also engage in extensive hydrophobic interactions with nearby residues from TM3, TM6-7, and ECL2 ( Figures 3 A and 3B).
Compared to SKF81297 and SKF83959, apomorphine occupies nearly an identical binding pocket ( Figures 3 C, 3E, and 3F). The four-ring scaffold of apomorphine nearly overlaps with the three-ring structure of SKF compounds, with the two hydroxyl groups form the catechol moiety and the amine group are located in essentially the same positions, thus engaging in a similar set of interactions with D1R ( Figure 3 C). A significant distinction between apomorphine and the SKF compounds is that the benzyl rings of SKF81297 and SKF83959 ( Figures 3 E and 3F) protrude further upward to ECL2.
To correlate the structural observations with the ligand binding activity, we individually mutated most of the ligand pocket residues and assessed their effects on expression levels, their ability to bind ligands using radioligand competition binding assays, and their ability to stimulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) production and β-arrestin recruitment assays. We used a tritiated D1R antagonist, [ 3 H]SCH23390, which shares high chemical similarity with the SKF compounds. Consistent with other aminergic GPCRs ( Vass et al., 2019 50. Vass, M. ∙ Podlewska, S. ∙ de Esch, I.J.P. ... Aminergic GPCR-Ligand Interactions: A Chemical and Structural Map of Receptor Mutation Data J. Med. Chem. 2019; 62 :3784-3839 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ), mutation of the conserved D103 3.32 A, which forms hydrogen bonds with the conserved amine group in all ligands, resulted in the loss of all binding of [ 3 H]SCH23390 in saturation binding experiments and loss of cAMP production in the Glosensor assay ( Figures 3 A–3C; Table S2 ). Additionally, mutations of residues in the orthosteric binding pocket (OBP) that directly interact with SKF81297, SKF83959, and apomorphine, I104 3.33 A, L190 ECL2 A, S198 5.42 A, S199 5.43 A, N292 6.55 A/H, and W321 7.43 Y, all displayed decreased binding of [ 3 H]SCH23390 when compared to WT D1R, suggesting that SCH23390 might adopt a similar binding pose as to those three agonists ( Figures 3 A–3C; Table S2 ). Results from the [ 3 H]-SCH23390 competing binding analysis and cAMP production assays further support the binding modes of SKF81297, SKF83959, and apomorphine. Mutations of residues D103 3.32 and S198 5.42 , which are highly conserved in aminergic receptors and play critical roles in receptor activation( Vass et al., 2019 50. Vass, M. ∙ Podlewska, S. ∙ de Esch, I.J.P. ... Aminergic GPCR-Ligand Interactions: A Chemical and Structural Map of Receptor Mutation Data J. Med. Chem. 2019; 62 :3784-3839 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ), led to either a loss of or compromised activity of each agonist ( Figure 3 G; Tables S3 and S4 ). In addition, mutations of other residues around the pocket, including K81 2.61 , I104 3.33 , S107 3.36 , L190 ECL2 , S199 5.43 , and N292 6.55 , also reduced activities of the three agonists ( Figure 3 G; Tables S3 and S4 ). For each agonist, its para -hydroxyl group interacts weakly with S199 5.43 but forms strong hydrogen bonds with S198 5.42 and its meta -hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with N292 6.55 . In cAMP assays, the S199 5.43 A mutation displayed a similar pEC 50 , whereas mutations S198 5.42 A and N292 6.55 A displayed significantly greater reduction in pEC 50 for each compound when compared to the WT D1R ( Figure 3 G; Table S4 ), supporting the binding modes of SKF81297, SKF83959, and apomorphine in their respective structures.
Several mutations displayed different effects for SKF81297, SKF83959, and apomorphine in the cAMP production assays, which may be caused by the slightly different binding modes of these agonists. The mutation S202 5.46 A resulted in greater reduction in pEC 50 s for SKF83959 and apomorphine than for SKF81297( Figures 3 G and S6 ; Table S4 ), consistent with their differences in forming hydrogen bonds with S202 5.46 ( Figures 3 D–3F). The greater reduction in pEC 50 values for the two SKF compounds than for apomorphine caused by the mutation L190 ECL2 A is likely due to the closer distance between the SKF compounds and ECL2 ( Figures 3 E–3G and S6 ; Table S4 ). The mutation N292 6.55 H led to an increased pEC 50 for apomorphine but significantly decreased pEC 50 s for the SKF compounds ( Figures 3 G and S6 ; Table S4 ), which may be due to a potential steric clash between the histamine residue and the benzyl ring of the SKF compounds.
Although the D1R belongs to the same dopamine receptor family as D2-like receptors, the closest phylogenetic neighbors of D1R are the β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) that also couple to G s ( Vass et al., 2019 50. Vass, M. ∙ Podlewska, S. ∙ de Esch, I.J.P. ... Aminergic GPCR-Ligand Interactions: A Chemical and Structural Map of Receptor Mutation Data J. Med. Chem. 2019; 62 :3784-3839 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was suggested previously that the endogenous catecholamine βAR agonist epinephrine (EP) can also activate dopamine receptors but with much less potency ( Lanau et al., 1997 26. Lanau, F. ∙ Zenner, M.T. ∙ Civelli, O. ... Epinephrine and norepinephrine act as potent agonists at the recombinant human dopamine D4 receptor J. Neurochem. 1997; 68 :804-812 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sánchez-Soto et al., 2016 48. Sánchez-Soto, M. ∙ Bonifazi, A. ∙ Cai, N.S. ... Evidence for Noncanonical Neurotransmitter Activation: Norepinephrine as a Dopamine D2-Like Receptor Agonist Mol. Pharmacol. 2016; 89 :457-466 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of the β 2 AR in complex with EP has been reported ( Ring et al., 2013 44. Ring, A.M. ∙ Manglik, A. ∙ Kruse, A.C. ... Adrenaline-activated structure of β2-adrenoceptor stabilized by an engineered nanobody Nature. 2013; 502 :575-579 Crossref Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignment of the structures of D1R-SKF81297 and β 2 AR-EP revealed similar receptor interaction patterns for these two ligands with a main difference in the interaction with residues of TM7. In the structure of β 2 AR-EP, N312 7.39 and Y316 7.43 form direct hydrogen bond interactions with EP. Instead, in the structure of D1R-SKF81297, the corresponding residues V317 7.39 and W321 7.43 adopt no direct polar interactions but hydrophobic interaction with SKF81297 ( Figure S7 A). We further analyzed the binding affinities of the two catecholamine β 2 AR agonists EP and isoproterenol (ISO), to the wild-type D1R, the D1R mutants V317N, W321Y individually, and the D1R mutant containing both V317N and W321Y. We found that the WT D1R could be activated by EP and ISO to similar extents. Both V317N and V317N/W321Y D1R mutants showed increased binding affinities to ISO and EP, whereas the W321Y mutation had no effect on the binding affinities of these two compounds to D1R, demonstrating that the D1R residue V317 7.39 is important for the selectivity of D1R for dopamine over other catecholamines, including EP ( Figure S7 B; Table S5 ).
Although SKF83959 and SKF81297 share highly similar chemical structures, their potency in inducing G s signaling differs significantly, which is likely due to the slightly different binding poses of SKF81297 and SKF83959 ( Figures 3 D, 3G, and S6 ) ( Lee et al., 2014 27. Lee, S.M. ∙ Kant, A. ∙ Blake, D. ... SKF-83959 is not a highly-biased functionally selective D1 dopamine receptor ligand with activity at phospholipase C Neuropharmacology. 2014; 86 :145-154 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to SKF81297, SKF83959 is closer to TM5 due to the steric effects between the extra methyl groups in SKF83959 and D1R residues F313 7.35 and W321 7.43 ( Figures 3 B and 3D). Previous structural studies on the β 2 AR suggested that agonists can induce an inward movement of TM5 in the ligand-binding pocket, which is associated with the conformational changes at the cytoplasmic region during receptor activation ( Rasmussen et al., 2011a 41. Rasmussen, S.G. ∙ Choi, H.J. ∙ Fung, J.J. ... Structure of a nanobody-stabilized active state of the β(2) adrenoceptor Nature. 2011; 469 :175-180 Crossref Scopus (1387) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the β 2 AR partial agonist salmeterol has been suggested to have a weaker effect on stabilizing the inward movement of TM5 compared to the β 2 AR full agonist epinephrine, resulting in its lower efficacy ( Masureel et al., 2018 33. Masureel, M. ∙ Zou, Y. ∙ Picard, L.P. ... Structural insights into binding specificity, efficacy and bias of a β 2 AR partial agonist Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14 :1059-1066 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, in the D1R structures, the closer distance between SKF83959 and TM5 as a result of steric effects between methyl groups of SKF83959 and D1R residues F313 7.35 and W321 7.43 may lead to a weaker ability of SKF83959 in inducing the inward movement of TM5 and thus a lower efficacy of SKF83959 compared to SKF81297. Supporting this hypothesis, it has been shown that removing one methyl group in SKF83959 could increase its efficacy ( Lee et al., 2014 27. Lee, S.M. ∙ Kant, A. ∙ Blake, D. ... SKF-83959 is not a highly-biased functionally selective D1 dopamine receptor ligand with activity at phospholipase C Neuropharmacology. 2014; 86 :145-154 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, mutations of F313 7.35 and W321 7.43 to residues with smaller side chains, which potentially eliminated their steric restrictions on SKF83959, led to comparable efficacy of SKF83959 and SKF81297 in our cAMP accumulation assays ( Figure S6 ).
Interestingly, previous studies also showed that although both SKF compounds could activate the G s -cAMP signaling pathway, only SKF81297, but not SKF83959, could stimulate β-arrestin recruitment ( Conroy et al., 2015 12. Conroy, J.L. ∙ Free, R.B. ∙ Sibley, D.R. Identification of G protein-biased agonists that fail to recruit β-arrestin or promote internalization of the D1 dopamine receptor ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2015; 6 :681-692 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is consistent with the result from our β-arrestin recruitment assays ( Table S6 ). The subtle differences in the binding modes of the two SKF compounds revealed by our structures and mutagenesis studies may lead to distinct assembly of conformational states of D1R associated with different signaling properties. To illustrate the structural determinants of β-arrestin biased activity of SKF83959, we individually detected the β-arrestin recruitment activities of D1R mutants with mutations of residues near the binding pocket induced by dopamine, SKF81297, and SKF83959 through Tango assay ( Table S6 ). The results showed that F288L could significantly increase the maximum β-arrestin recruitment for both SKF83939 and SKF81297, whereas F288A could cause the opposite effect by reducing β-arrestin recruitment for both ligands. F289A could also lead to increased β-arrestin recruitment for both ligands but to a much less extent than that induced by F288L. Interestingly, the mutation V317A could almost abolish SKF81297-induced β-arrestin recruitment but slightly increase that induced by SKF83959 ( Table S6 ). All of these results suggested important roles of F288 6.51 , F289 6.52 , and V317 7.39 in the D1R agonist-induced β-arrestin recruitment. In our structure, the V317 7.39 , F288 6.51 , and W321 7.43 residues participate in the hydrophobic packing with the methyl group in the azepine ring of SKF83959 compound ( Figure 3 B), suggesting that such methyl group is vital in the biased activity of SKF83959 to D1R. Moreover, previous studies reported that other SKF compounds with bulky side chains attached to the amine group of azepine ring also showed biased signaling activities on D1R similar to SKF83959 ( Conroy et al., 2015 12. Conroy, J.L. ∙ Free, R.B. ∙ Sibley, D.R. Identification of G protein-biased agonists that fail to recruit β-arrestin or promote internalization of the D1 dopamine receptor ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2015; 6 :681-692 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), further proving the important role of the additional methyl group in SKF83959 for its biased activity.
Currently, no structure of the inactive D1R is available to allow proper structural comparison with the active D1R. Nevertheless, we observed that the structures of D1R-G s signaling complexes are highly similar to the structure of the β 2 AR-G s signaling complex ( Figures 4 A and 4B). In particular, critical structural elements in β 2 AR including three TMs, TM5, TM6, and TM7, the DR 3.50 Y motif, and the core P 5.50 I 3.40 F 6.44 motif, which undergoes large conformational changes during the activation of β 2 AR ( Rasmussen et al., 2011b 42. Rasmussen, S.G. ∙ DeVree, B.T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex Nature. 2011; 477 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (2447) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steyaert and Kobilka, 2011 49. Steyaert, J. ∙ Kobilka, B.K. Nanobody stabilization of G protein-coupled receptor conformational states Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21 :567-572 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ), can be well aligned to those in D1R ( Figures 4 C–4E), suggesting a highly conserved activation mechanism for D1R and β 2 AR. It is to be noted that the relative orientations of G s to D1R and to β 2 AR in the G s -coupled structures are highly similar. This is in contrast to the highly diverse modes of coupling of G i to different GPCRs ( Zhuang et al., 2020 60. Zhuang, Y. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Edward Zhou, X. ... Structure of formylpeptide receptor 2-G i complex reveals insights into ligand recognition and signaling Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :885 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). One significant structural difference between the D1R-G s and β 2 AR-G s complexes is that the cytoplasmic end of TM5 of D1R is extended by two additional helical turns compared to that of β 2 AR, which forms additional interactions with the Ras-like domain of G αs ( Figures 4 A and 4B).
For D2R, structural comparison of the active bromocriptine-bound D2R to the inactive risperidone-bound D2R ( Wang et al., 2018 54. Wang, S. ∙ Che, T. ∙ Levit, A. ... Structure of the D2 dopamine receptor bound to the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone Nature. 2018; 555 :269-273 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicated large conformational changes at both cytoplasmic and extracellular regions ( Figures 5 A and 5B). In the inactive D2R structure, the pyrimidine group of risperidone is deeply inserted into the bottom of the ligand binding pocket and forms direct hydrophobic interaction with the toggle switch residue W386 6.48 , thus restricting the downward swing of W386 6.48 and locking the receptor in its inactive state ( Figure 5 C). In the active bromocriptine-bound D2R structure, the hydrophobic interactions between bromocriptine and W386 6.48 result in a downward movement of the toggle switch residue W386 6.48 ( Figure 5 C). The swing of W386 6.48 is accompanied by conformational changes of residue F403 6.44 in the PIF motif ( Figure 5 D), R132 3.50 in the DRY motif ( Figure 5 E), and an inward movement of TM7 ( Figure 5 F). These conformational changes are further associated with the breakage of the conserved ionic lock between R132 3.50 and E389 6.30 and an outward movement of 9 Å at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 ( Figure 5 B). Together, these conformational changes open up the TMD cavity to allow the α5 helix of G αi to insert into the TMD of D2R. This activation mechanism is consistent with other class A GPCRs, such as rhodopsin ( Kang et al., 2018 22. Kang, Y. ∙ Kuybeda, O. ∙ de Waal, P.W. ... Cryo-EM structure of human rhodopsin bound to an inhibitory G protein Nature. 2018; 558 :553-558 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ), A 2A R ( García-Nafría et al., 2018 18.

Cryo-EM structure of the adenosine A 2A receptor coupled to an engineered heterotrimeric G protein eLife. 2018; 7 :e35946 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and CB2 ( Xing et al., 2020 56. Xing, C. ∙ Zhuang, Y. ∙ Xu, T.H. ... Cryo-EM Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2-G i Signaling Complex Cell. 2020; 180 :645-654.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although D1R and D2R share a large number of common agonists ( Wang et al., 2017 53. Wang, S. ∙ Wacker, D. ∙ Levit, A. ... D 4 dopamine receptor high-resolution structures enable the discovery of selective agonists Science. 2017; 358 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ), structural comparison of D1R and D2R reveals that their ligand pockets have very distinct topology at the extracellular vestibule ( Figures 6 A and 6B). The SKF compounds are highly selective D1R agonists, while apomorphine is generally considered as a non-selective dopamine receptor agonist ( Andersen and Jansen, 1990 3. Andersen, P.H. ∙ Jansen, J.A. Dopamine receptor agonists: selectivity and dopamine D1 receptor efficacy Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 188 :335-347 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reichmann et al., 2006 43. Reichmann, H. ∙ Bilsing, A. ∙ Ehret, R. ... Ergoline and non-ergoline derivatives in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease J. Neurol. 2006; 253 :IV36-IV38 PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structures indicate that the binding poses of SKF81297 and SKF83959 are closer to the ECL2 than that of apomorphine in D1R ( Figure 6 C). If SKF81297, SKF83959, and apomorphine bound to D2R with similar poses as in D1R, both SKF compounds, but not apomorphine, would clash with ECL2, especially the residue I184 ECL2 of D2R ( Figure 6 C), thus accounting in part for its non-selective agonist activity to dopamine receptors. In D1R, the residue S188 ECL2 at the corresponding position of I184 ECL2 in D2R has a smaller side chain, which is also moved away from the ligand-binding pocket, resulting in extra space to accommodate the bulky phenyl moieties of SKF81297 and SKF83959 that extend from their core benzazepine ring scaffolds ( Figures 6 A–6C).
Structural comparison of D1R and D2R also provides insight into the ∼50-fold selectivity of bromocriptine for D2R over D1R ( De Keyser et al., 1995 13. De Keyser, J. ∙ De Backer, J.P. ∙ Wilczak, N. ... Dopamine agonists used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and their selectivity for the D1, D2, and D3 dopamine receptors in human striatum Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1995; 19 :1147-1154 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Superposition of the D1R and D2R structures reveals that the bromocriptine ergoline ring overlaps with the benzazepine rings of the SKF compounds in the orthosteric binding pocket (OBP) ( Figure 6 D). The tricyclic peptide group of bromocriptine extends upward to the extended binding pocket (EBP) that is in part formed by ECL2 ( Figures 6 D). Unlike SKF81297 and SKF83959, bromocriptine adopts a binding pose away from both ECL2 regions of D1R and D2R, thus avoiding the steric clash caused by ECL2 ( Figures 6 A–6D). The ECL2 sequence of D2R is similar to that of D3R but is greatly divergent from other dopamine receptors ( Figure S5 B). Compared to D2R, the EBP in D1R is less accessible than that of D2R due to a non-conserved residue K81 2.61 for the tricyclic peptide group of bromocriptine ( Figure 6 E). In addition, the extracellular end of TM6 of D1R is shifted 5.5 Å toward the ligand binding pocket, which would clash with the leucine side chain of bromocriptine ( Figures 6 A and 6F). These structural features explain the selectivity of bromocriptine for D2/3R over D1R. Furthermore, a more restricted binding space in D1R may explain its low ligandability and chemical tractability for drug development ( Hall et al., 2019 20. Hall, A. ∙ Provins, L. ∙ Valade, A. Novel Strategies To Activate the Dopamine D 1 Receptor: Recent Advances in Orthosteric Agonism and Positive Allosteric Modulation J. Med. Chem. 2019; 62 :128-140 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ).
D1R and D2R are the prototypical G s and G i coupled dopamine receptors and comparisons of the D1R and D2R structures provide the basis for the G protein coupling specificity. Three notable differences are observed at the cytoplasmic side between the active D1R and D2R structures. First, relative to D2R, TM6 of D1R is moved further outward by as much as 8.4 Å as measured at the Cα atoms of D1R F264 6.27 and D2R Q365 6.27 , the last residue of TM6 ( Figure 7 A). Second, TM5 of D1R is extended by an additional two and a half helical turns toward the intracellular side to make direct interaction with the G αs Ras domain ( Figures 7 A–7C). Third, the ICL2 helix of D1R is one helical turn longer than that of D2R and makes more extensive interactions with the hydrophobic pocket formed by the αN helix and α5 C-terminal helix of G αs ( Figures 7 A and 7D). The interface of D1R-G s is ∼1,520 Å 2 in all three D1R-G s complexes, which is larger than the D2R-G i interface of 1,088 Å 2 ( Figure 7 B).
The differences between the D1R and D2R structures lead to the different coupling mode of G s and G i to their corresponding receptors. To accommodate the 8.4 Å outward movement of TM6, the α5 helix of G αs has a 13° clockwise rotation relative to the α5 helix of G αi , which leads to an outward shift of 4.8 Å as measured at the Cα atoms of Y391 of G αs and C351 of G αi , the last residue from the α5 helix ( Figure 7 E). Correspondingly, the G αβγ heterotrimer is rotated by ∼20° as measured by the αN helix between the two structures ( Figure 7 F). Displacement of G i with G s in the G protein binding pocket of activated D2R would lead to a severe steric clash between the TM6 and α5 helix of G αs . In addition, the relatively narrow G protein binding cavity in the D2R intracellular region is insufficient for adopting the bulkier side chains of the G αs α5 helix. These structural findings imply that the conformations of TM6 and α5 helix play important roles in G s /G i selectivity of D1R and D2R, which is consistent with the previous simulation studies of TM6 among rhodopsin, μOR, A 2a R, and β 2 AR ( Kang et al., 2018 22. Kang, Y. ∙ Kuybeda, O. ∙ de Waal, P.W. ... Cryo-EM structure of human rhodopsin bound to an inhibitory G protein Nature. 2018; 558 :553-558 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, interactions between the extended TM5 and G protein may contribute to additional selectivity for G s and G i by D1R and D2R ( Figures 7 B and 7C).
In conclusion, D1R and D2R are the two prototypical receptors of dopamine signaling and serve as important drug targets for diverse CNS diseases. In this paper, we report four relatively high resolution cryo-EM structures of D1R and D2R signaling complexes bound to the two D1R-selective compounds SKF83959 and SKF81297 and the widely used anti-PD drugs apomorphine and bromocriptine. The structures, together with mutagenesis studies, reveal distinct features of the D1R and D2R ligand binding pockets that determine the D1R-selectivity for the SKF compounds, pan agonism of apomorphine, and the D2R/D3R-selectivity for bromocriptine, the potential activation mechanism for both D1R and D2R, and critical molecular determinants including TM7 residues F313 7.35 , V317 7.39 , and W321 7.43 of D1R and the extra methyl groups of SKF83959 in comparison to SKF81297 that lead to the partial and biased agonism of SKF83959 on D1R. The structures also reveal the differences in D1R and D2R that serve as the basis for G protein-coupling specificity. Particularly, the outward movement of TM6 and the extension of TM5 in the cytoplasmic side of D1R relative to D2R allow D1R to primarily couple with G s but not G i , and for D2R to couple G i but not G s . Together, our results provide unprecedented structural insights into the pharmacology and signaling of D1R and D2R and multiple structural templates for rational drug design targeting the dopaminergic system.

Two kinds of eukaryotic cell lines, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9, Expression systems) cells and HEK293T cells (ATCC), were used for recombinant protein expression and functional studies, respectively. Sf9 cells were grown in ESF 921 medium (Expression systems) at 27°C, 120 rpm. HEK293T cells were grown in humidified 37°C incubator in condition of 5% CO 2 using medium supplemented with 100 I.U. / mL penicillin and 100 mg / mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). The medium for human cell lines HEK293T was DMEM (VWR) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, VWR).
The full-length gene sequence of wild-type human D1R was synthesized and subcloned into pFastBac (Thermo Fisher) vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag followed by a fragment of β 2 AR N-terminal tail region (BN, hereafter) as fusion protein, along with a C-terminal 8 × His tag to facilitate the protein expression and purification. The D1R sequence had no additional mutations or loop deletions. A TEV cleavage site was inserted between BN and D1R gene sequences. The prolactin precursor sequence was placed into the N terminus before the FLAG tag as signaling peptide to increase D1R cell membrane localization and increase D1R expression ( Figure S1 A). For structure determination of the D1R-G s -SKF81297 and D1R-G s -SKF83959 complexes, a dominant-negative form of human G αs (DN_G αs ) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate mutations G226A and A366S to decrease the affinity of nucleotide binding to the heterotrimer G αβγ complex ( Liu et al., 2016 31. Liu, P. ∙ Jia, M.Z. ∙ Zhou, X.E. ... The structural basis of the dominant negative phenotype of the Gαi1β1γ2 G203A/A326S heterotrimer Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2016; 37 :1259-1272 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). To obtain a well-performed D1R-G s -apomorphine complex, a miniG αs format including mutations G226A and A366S (DN_miniG αs ) was constructed by removing the α-helical domain of G αs and introducing mutations according to the previously reported miniG αs sequence ( Carpenter et al., 2016 8. Carpenter, B. ∙ Nehmé, R. ∙ Warne, T. ...

Cryo-EM structure of the adenosine A 2A receptor coupled to an engineered heterotrimeric G protein eLife. 2018; 7 :e35946 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 B). All the three G s protein complex components, DN_G αs / DN_mini G αs , rat G β1 and bovine G γ2 , were cloned into pFastbac vector separately with a His8 tag introduced into the N terminus of G β1 to aid purification. For structure determination of the D2R-G i -bromocriptine complex, the full-length gene sequence of wild-type human D2R was cloned into pFastBac vector with an N-terminal haemagglutinin (HA) signaling peptide sequence followed by a FLAG tag, a His8 tag and a BRIL to facilitate expression and purification ( Figure S1 H). Four dominant-negative mutations, S47N, G203A, E245A, A326S, were incorporated into human G αi (DN_G αi ) to reduce the nucleotide binding ( Liang et al., 2018 29. Liang, Y.-L. ∙ Zhao, P. ∙ Draper-Joyce, C. ... Dominant Negative G Proteins Enhance Formation and Purification of Agonist-GPCR-G Protein Complexes for Structure Determination ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2018; 1 :12-20 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human DN_G αi , rat G β1 , bovine G γ2 and scFv16 antibody fragment ( Koehl et al., 2018 23. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the μ-opioid receptor-G i protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar ) were cloned into pFastBac vector.

Dose-fractionated image stacks were subjected to beam-induced motion correction using MotionCor2.1 ( Zheng et al., 2017 59. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ). A sum of all frames, filtered according to the exposure dose, in each image stack was used for further processing. Contrast transfer function parameters for each micrograph were determined by Gctf v1.06 ( Zhang, 2016 58. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2309) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle selection and 2D and 3D classifications were performed on a binned dataset with a pixel size of 2.028 Å using RELION-3.0-beta2(3) ( Zivanov et al., 2018 61. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2804) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the D1R-SKF81297-G s dataset, auto-picking yielded 1,197,896 particle projections that were subjected to reference-free 2D classification to discard false positive particles or particles categorized in poorly defined classes, producing 787,504 particle projections for further processing. This subset of particle projections was subjected to a round of maximum-likelihood-based three-dimensional classification with a pixel size of 2.028 Å. A selected subset containing 645,131 projections was used to obtain the final map using a pixel size of 1.014 Å. After the last round of refinement, the final map had an indicated global resolution of 3.0 Å at a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143. For the D1R-apomorphine-miniG s dataset, automated particle selection produced 1,668,950 particles, which were subjected to reference-free 2D classification to discard particles in poorly defined classes. The map of PTH1R-G s complex (EMDB: EMD-0410) low-pass filtered to 40 Å was used as an initial reference model for 2 rounds of 3D classification, resulting in two well-defined subsets with 363,884 projections. Further 3D classifications focusing the alignment on the receptor, produced one good subsets accounting for 212,652 particles, which were subsequently subjected to 3D refinement and Bayesian polishing with a pixel size of 1.014. The final refinement with frames 1-20 generated a map with an indicated global resolution of 3.0 Å at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.143.

About 2000 particles were manually selected and subjected to 2D classification. Representative averages were picked as template for auto-picking. The auto-picking process produced 2,034,626 particles, which were subjected to 2D classifications. An initial model was generated by RELION-3.0 and served as initial reference map for four rounds of 3D classifications, resulting in two well-defined subsets with 679,728 particles.

The structure of β 2 AR-G s complex (PDB: 3SN6 ) was used as initial model for model rebuilding and refinement against the electron microscopy maps of D1R-G s complexes. The structure of haloperidol bound D2R (6LUQ) and the structure of the G i part of the rhodopsin-G i complex (6CMO) were used as initial models for model building of the D2R-bromocriptine-G i -scFv16 complex. The initial models were docked into the electron microscopy density maps using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 39. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput.

MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (10877) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structure figures were prepared in Chimera and PyMOL ( https://pymol.org/2/ ). The final refinement statistics are provided in Table S1 . The extent of any model overfitting during refinement was measured by refining the final model against one of the half-maps and by comparing the resulting map versus model FSC curves with the two half-maps and the full model.
Binding assays were performed using membranes from HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) cells transiently expressing wild-type D1R or D1R mutants. Binding assays were set up in 96-well plates in standard binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Saturation binding assays with 0.5-5 nM [ 3 H]-SCH23390 (Perkin-Elmer) in standard binding buffer were performed to determine equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and Bmax, whereas 10 μM final concentration of Butaclamol was used to define nonspecific binding. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark and terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto chilled 0.3% PEI-soaked GF/A filters (Perkin-Elmer) followed by three quick washes with cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.40). Radioactivity counts were determined using a Wallac Trilux MicroBeta counter (Perkin-Elmer). Results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.4 (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) using “One site–Total and nonspecific binding.” Competition assays were performed similar to saturation binding assays except that various concentrations of competitor were premixed with [ 3 H]-SCH23390 (Perkin-Elmer) near the pre-determined equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark with membranes from HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) cells transiently expressing wild-type D1R or D1R mutants.

Cells were passed to 6-well plates (Genesee Scientific, Cat 25-106MP) and transfected using TransIT (Mirus Bio) and 0.4 μg of the given receptor. After at least 24 h, transfected cells were plated in polylysine-coated 96-well white clear bottom cell culture plates (Greiner Bio-One) in plating media (DMEM containing 1% (v/v) dialyzed FBS, 1 IU mL -1 Penicillin G, and 100 μg mL -1 Streptomycin) at a density of 20,000 cells in 200 μL per well and incubated overnight. The following day, media was aspirated and cells were washed twice with 200 μL of 1 × Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Then 100 μL of 1 × PBS containing 5% (w/v) BSA was added to each well and incubated at RT. After 30 min, 100 μL of 1:10,000 anti-hemagglutinin HRP conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich Cat A8592) was added to each well. After an additional 30 min, media was aspirated and cells were washed twice with 200 μL of 1 × Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Chemiluminescence was observed by the addition of 50 μL of HRP substrate (Thermo Fisher, Cat 37069) and counted using a Wallac Trilux MicroBeta counter (Perkin-Elmer). Chemiluminescence values were normalized to wild-type receptor and graphed as a percentage of wild-type using Graphpad Prism 8 (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
D1R G S -mediated G S -cAMP accumulation assays with HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) were performed using cells transiently expressing human D1R and the cAMP biosensor GloSensor-22F (Promega). Cells were seeded (20 000 cells/35 μL/well) into white 384 clear-bottom, tissue culture plates in DMEM containing 1% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS). Next day, 3x drug dilutions were diluted in HBSS, 20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.03% (w/v) ascorbic acid, pH 7.4. Media was decanted from 384 well plates and 20 μL of drug buffer (HBSS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing GloSensor reagent was added per well and allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then treated with 10 μL per well of 3 × drug using a FLIPR (Molecular Devices). After 15 min, G s -cAMP accumulation was read on a TriLux Microbeta (PerkinElmer) plate counter. Data were analyzed using the sigmoidal log(agonist) versus dose response function built into GraphPad Prism 8.4.

HTLA cells expressing TEV fused-β-Arrestin2 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Axel, Columbia Univ.) were transfected with the 8 μg DRD1 Tango construct. After at least 16 h, cells were plated in DMEM supplemented with 1% (v/v) dialyzed FBS in poly-L-lysine coated 384-well white clear bottom cell culture plates at a density of 10,000-15,000 cells/well in a total of 40 μL. The cells were incubated for at least 6 h before receiving drug stimulation. Drug solutions were prepared in drug buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1 × HBSS, 0.3% BSA, pH 7.4) at 3 × and added to cells (20 μL per well) for overnight incubation. After at least 16 h, media and drug solutions were removed and 20 μL per well of diluted 1:20 BrightGlo reagent (Promega) was added. The plate was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark before being counted using a TriLux Microbeta (PerkinElmer) plate counter. Results (relative luminescence units) were plotted as a function of drug concentration and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.
The density maps were prepared in UCSF Chimera ( https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/ ) and UCSF ChimeraX ( https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/ ). Structural comparison and alignment figures were prepared with PyMOL ( https://pymol.org/2/ ).
For radioligand saturation binding assays, results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.4 (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) using “One site–Total and nonspecific binding.” For the radioligand competition binding assays, data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.4 (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) using either “One site-Fit Ki” or “Two site-Fit Ki” as determined when comparing values in GraphPad Prism 8.4. For surface expression levels of WT D1R and D1R mutants, chemiluminescence values were normalized to wild-type receptor and graphed as a percentage of wild-type using Graphpad Prism 8.4 (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The pEC 50 values were calculated for individual experiments using the sigmoidal log(agonist) versus dose response function built into GraphPad Prism 8.4. Average Emax values for cAMP accumulation assay were determined from “log(agonist) vs. response- Variable slope (four parameters)” function in Graphpad Prism 8.4 software (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Average Emax and basal values for the β-arrestin recruitment Tango assays were determined from the highest and lowest concentrations of the respective compound. Data in the figures and tables are presented as mean values ± standard error of measurement (SEM) with the number of biological and technical replicates indicated in the figure and table legends.
