Title: PspA adopts an ESCRT-III-like fold and remodels bacterial membranes


Abstract: Summary

PspA is the main effector of the phage shock protein (Psp) system and preserves the bacterial inner membrane integrity and function. Here, we present the 3.6 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of PspA assembled in helical rods. PspA monomers adopt a canonical ESCRT-III fold in an extended open conformation. PspA rods are capable of enclosing lipids and generating positive membrane curvature. Using cryo-EM, we visualized how PspA remodels membrane vesicles into μm-sized structures and how it mediates the formation of internalized vesicular structures. Hotspots of these activities are zones derived from PspA assemblies, serving as lipid transfer platforms and linking previously separated lipid structures. These membrane fusion and fission activities are in line with the described functional properties of bacterial PspA/IM30/LiaH proteins. Our structural and functional analyses reveal that bacterial PspA belongs to the evolutionary ancestry of ESCRT-III proteins involved in membrane remodeling.

Section: Introduction

Membrane remodeling and re-shaping is crucial for cell viability in all domains of life. In order to maintain the integrity of internal membranes under conditions such as heat stress, osmotic stress, organic solvents, or phage infections, many bacteria activate the phage shock protein (Psp) system ( Brissette et al., 1990 8.

Stress-induced expression of the Escherichia coli phage shock protein operon is dependent on σ 54 and modulated by positive and negative feedback mechanisms Genes Dev. 1991; 5 :1912-1923 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). The currently best studied E. coli Psp - system consists of seven genes: the pspABCDE operon, the regulation factor pspF , and the effector pspG ( Brissette et al., 1991 9.

Chem. 2004; 279 :55707-55714 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Psp response is triggered during dissipation of the proton motive force and secretin mislocation ( Darwin, 2005 13. Darwin, A.J. The phage-shock-protein response Mol.

Rev. 2010; 34 :797-827 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ), which both indicate defects in the structure and integrity of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. PspA is the key effector of the Psp system, and in E. coli , it interacts with the cytoplasmic membrane sensor proteins PspB and PspC ( Darwin, 2005 13. Darwin, A.J. The phage-shock-protein response Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57 :621-628 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ; Joly et al., 2010 37. Joly, N. ∙ Engl, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ... Managing membrane stress: the phage shock protein (Psp) response, from molecular mechanisms to physiology FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 34 :797-827 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Free PspA can bind peripherally to bacterial inner membranes by interacting with negatively charged membrane lipids ( Jovanovic et al., 2014 38. Jovanovic, G. ∙ Mehta, P. ∙ McDonald, C. ... The N-terminal amphipathic helices determine regulatory and effector functions of phage shock protein A (PspA) in Escherichia coli J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426 :1498-1511 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thereby counteracts membrane stress ( Joly et al., 2010 37. Joly, N. ∙ Engl, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ... Managing membrane stress: the phage shock protein (Psp) response, from molecular mechanisms to physiology FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 34 :797-827 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Manganelli and Gennaro, 2017 54. Manganelli, R. ∙ Gennaro, M.L. Protecting from Envelope Stress: Variations on the Phage-Shock-Protein Theme Trends Microbiol. 2017; 25 :205-216 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). This way, membrane-bound PspA can, for instance, block proton leakage of isolated damaged membranes ( Kobayashi et al., 2007 44. Kobayashi, R. ∙ Suzuki, T. ∙ Yoshida, M. Escherichia coli phage-shock protein A (PspA) binds to membrane phospholipids and repairs proton leakage of the damaged membranes Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66 :100-109 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). In support, members of the PspA family are thought to tether and seal stress-induced membrane lesions, presumably by triggering lipid bilayer fusion ( Siebenaller et al., 2020 75. Siebenaller, C. ∙ Junglas, B. ∙ Lehmann, A. ... Proton Leakage Is Sensed by IM30 and Activates IM30-Triggered Membrane Fusion Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :4530 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ). Indeed, a membrane fusion activity has been reported previously for the PspA homolog IM30 (inner membrane-associated protein of 30 kDa, alternatively known as Vipp1) of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ( Hennig et al., 2015 35. Hennig, R. ∙ Heidrich, J. ∙ Saur, M. ... IM30 triggers membrane fusion in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7018 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recently, a membrane protecting protein carpet mechanism has been proposed for IM30 ( Junglas et al., 2020 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Orru, R. ∙ Axt, A. ... IM30 IDPs form a membrane-protective carpet upon super-complex disassembly Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :595 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although the Psp response system appears to be conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, Psp homologs have also been identified in cyanobacteria, archaea as well as in chloroplasts ( Manganelli and Gennaro, 2017 54. Manganelli, R. ∙ Gennaro, M.L. Protecting from Envelope Stress: Variations on the Phage-Shock-Protein Theme Trends Microbiol. 2017; 25 :205-216 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, solely homologs of PspA appear to be strictly conserved and thus critical for membrane protection and remodeling ( Manganelli and Gennaro, 2017 54. Manganelli, R. ∙ Gennaro, M.L. Protecting from Envelope Stress: Variations on the Phage-Shock-Protein Theme Trends Microbiol. 2017; 25 :205-216 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). The homologous proteins PspA, IM30/Vipp1 (chloroplasts and cyanobacteria), and LiaH ( Firmicutes , Bacillus , and Listeria ) are part of a bacterial membrane remodeling family that shares many structural and functional features for maintaining membrane integrity ( Thurotte et al., 2017 82.

PspA/LiaH/IM30 proteins form large ring and rod-like homo-oligomeric structures (>1 MDa) and share predicted secondary structures and conserved sequence motifs ( Bultema et al., 2010 10.

The fragment structure of an extended α-helical hairpin formed by the 2 nd and 3 rd Eco PspA helices was resolved by X-ray crystallography ( Osadnik et al., 2015 64.

Although most membrane-remodeling proteins such as epsin, dynamin, or BAR domain-containing proteins were first identified in eukaryotes ( Ford et al., 2002 20. Ford, M.G.J. ∙ Mills, I.G. ∙ Peter, B.J. ... Curvature of clathrin-coated pits driven by epsin Nature. 2002; 419 :361-366 Crossref Scopus (830) PubMed Google Scholar ; Frost et al., 2009 21.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5 :133-147 Crossref Scopus (1173) PubMed Google Scholar ), membrane remodeling is a common process in all three domains of life. For instance, endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) were originally characterized in eukaryotic membrane trafficking events of multivesicular body biogenesis ( Katzmann et al., 2001 41. Katzmann, D.J. ∙ Babst, M. ∙ Emr, S.D. Ubiquitin-dependent sorting into the multivesicular body pathway requires the function of a conserved endosomal protein sorting complex, ESCRT-I Cell. 2001; 106 :145-155 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1194) PubMed Google Scholar ), viral budding ( Garrus et al., 2001 23. Garrus, J.E. ∙ von Schwedler, U.K. ∙ Pornillos, O.W. ... Tsg101 and the vacuolar protein sorting pathway are essential for HIV-1 budding Cell. 2001; 107 :55-65 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1198) PubMed Google Scholar ), and cytokinesis ( Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 12. Carlton, J.G. ∙ Martin-Serrano, J. Parallels between cytokinesis and retroviral budding: a role for the ESCRT machinery Science. 2007; 316 :1908-1912 Crossref Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the common topology of moving membrane away from the cytosol. More recently, they have been shown to be involved in a series of diverse membrane remodeling processes in eukaryotic cells, which include nuclear envelope sealing ( Vietri et al., 2015 83. Vietri, M. ∙ Schink, K.O. ∙ Campsteijn, C. ... Spastin and ESCRT-III coordinate mitotic spindle disassembly and nuclear envelope sealing Nature. 2015; 522 :231-235 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ), plasma membrane repair, lysosomal protein degradation ( Zhu et al., 2017 92. Zhu, W. ∙ Krishna, S. ∙ Garcia, C. ... Daam2 driven degradation of VHL promotes gliomagenesis eLife. 2017; 6 :e31926 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), and closure of autophagosomes ( Takahashi et al., 2018 76. Takahashi, Y. ∙ He, H. ∙ Tang, Z. ... An autophagy assay reveals the ESCRT-III component CHMP2A as a regulator of phagophore closure Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2855 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhen et al., 2020 91. Zhen, Y. ∙ Spangenberg, H. ∙ Munson, M.J. ... ESCRT-mediated phagophore sealing during mitophagy Autophagy. 2020; 16 :826-841 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite this functional diversity, the responsible core proteins belong to a single conserved group of ESCRT-III proteins. ESCRT-III proteins comprise approximately 220 amino acids and share seven predicted α helices (helices α0–α6). Structural analyses of truncated CHMP3 revealed a compact structure made of a four-helix bundle comprising a long α-helical hairpin motif ( Muzioł et al., 2006 61. Muzioł, T. ∙ Pineda-Molina, E. ∙ Ravelli, R.B. ... Structural basis for budding by the ESCRT-III factor CHMP3 Dev. Cell. 2006; 10 :821-830 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recently, polymers assembled from full-length ESCRT-III were elucidated at near-atomic resolution using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM): human IST1 and CHMP1B form a hetero-polymer with a compact and extended conformation forming a tubular assembly ( McCullough et al., 2015 57. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ... Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas yeast Vps24 assembles in a double-stranded filament composed of domain-swapped dimers in the extended conformation ( Huber et al., 2020 36. Huber, S.T. ∙ Mostafavi, S. ∙ Mortensen, S.A. ... Structure and assembly of ESCRT-III helical Vps24 filaments Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 :eaba4897 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structures of IST1/CHMP1B tubes confirmed the presence of a lipid bilayer in the lumen of the assemblies ( Nguyen et al., 2020 63. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, IST1/CHMP1B is capable of constricting vesicles and inducing positive membrane curvature suitable for opposite ESCRT topology membrane processes. It has been shown that mixing of different ESCRT proteins in a particular order is required to assemble hetero-polymeric complexes that drive membrane remodeling in vitro ( Huber et al., 2020 36. Huber, S.T. ∙ Mostafavi, S. ∙ Mortensen, S.A. ... Structure and assembly of ESCRT-III helical Vps24 filaments Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 :eaba4897 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pfitzner et al., 2020 67. Pfitzner, A.-K. ∙ Mercier, V. ∙ Jiang, X. ... An ESCRT-III Polymerization Sequence Drives Membrane Deformation and Fission Cell. 2020; 182 :1140-1155.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Downstream of the ESCRT-III activity is the AAA-ATPase Vps4 that promotes assembly and disassembly of ESCRT-III complexes and thereby contributes to membrane remodeling ( Caillat et al., 2019 11. Caillat, C. ∙ Maity, S. ∙ Miguet, N. ... The role of VPS4 in ESCRT-III polymer remodeling Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2019; 47 :441-448 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Despite the known critical roles of ESCRT-III proteins in the Archaea and Eukarya kingdom, members of a conserved bacterial ESCRT family have not yet been identified by sequence analysis, structural comparison, or by functional characterization. In the current study, we determined the 3.6 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of PspA assembled in helical tubes. The built atomic model reveals that PspA adopts a canonical ESCRT-III fold making up the wall of the tubular assemblies. When PspA is reconstituted with small lipid vesicles, it induces vesicle growth and formation of internalized membrane structures, indicating membrane fusion as well as fission activities. The cryo-EM structure combined with biochemical lipid remodeling experiments show that bacterial PspA is a bona fide member of an evolutionary conserved ESCRT-III family.

Section: Results

In order to structurally investigate the membrane-protective mechanism of PspA, we overexpressed PspA of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Expression of a fluorescent Synechocystis PspA variant in a Δ pspA E. coli strain resulted in the formation of multiple, large PspA assemblies in vivo , which were preferably localized at the cell poles ( Figure S1 A), supporting previous observations of large inner membrane-associated PspA oligomers ( Engl et al., 2009 17.

Changes in Psp protein binding partners, localization and behaviour upon activation of the Yersinia enterocolitica phage shock protein response Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 87 :656-671 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, we visualized purified PspA using cryo-EM. The acquired micrographs show elongated rod assemblies with around 20 nm width and varying lengths of up to several hundreds of nanometers ( Figure 1 A). Closer analysis of the 2D class average from a homogeneous subset ( Figures S1 B and S1C) revealed a basic Christmas-tree pattern with a longitudinal repeat every 30 Å indicative of a repeating pitch typical for helical assemblies ( Figure 1 B). The corresponding power spectrum showed a layer line pattern diffracting to approximately 7 Å resolution and revealed the helical organization with a helical rise and rotation of 2.9 Å and 35.3° per subunit ( Figures 1 C and S1 D). Using a total of 139,300 asymmetric units, we then determined the cryo-EM structure at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å ( Figure 1 D; Table S1 ), with resolution variation between 3.5 Å and 4.7 Å at 50 Å and 100 Å radial distance from the helical axis, respectively ( Figure 1 E). After density segmentation, we found that a single subunit has an elongated shape of 180 × 20 Å dimension, which is positioned perpendicularly to the rod axis ( Figure 1 F). When seen in top view, the subunit extends over one-third of the rod’s cross section. In side view, the subunits are arranged like overlapping bricks that constitute the wall of the helical rod ( Figure 1 G).
Using the segmented density, we built an atomic model of a PspA monomer, covering residues 22–217 arranged in five α helices connected by loops ( Figures 2 A–2C). At one end of the elongated subunit, we identified a density that corresponds to the long α-helical hairpin PspA fragment (PDB: 4WHE ) ( Osadnik et al., 2015 64. Osadnik, H. ∙ Schöpfel, M. ∙ Heidrich, E. ... PspF-binding domain PspA1-144 and the PspA·F complex: New insights into the coiled-coil-dependent regulation of AAA+ proteins Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 98 :743-759 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), independently confirming the chosen handedness of the cryo-EM map ( Figure 2 D). The best resolved density accommodates helices α1–α4 (25–185) ( Figures 2 E and 2F). We did not find density corresponding to a predicted N-terminal helix α0 (1–21) ( Figure S1 E), yet, we accommodated the amphipathic helix α5 (191–215) based on the weaker density attached to the outer wall of the helical rod ( Figures 2 G and S1 F). Together, helices α1–α4 constitute the elongated four-helix core of the PspA molecules that form the wall of the tubular rod structure via a brick-like stacking. A total of 10.19 subunits are wound in a right-handed manner to form a single 360° turn with a pitch of 30 Å ( Figure 2 H). The top view of the assembly reveals that the PspA core helices are arranged like the diaphragm of an iris aperture pointing to the outside of the rod ( Figure 2 I), whereas the amphipathic paddle helix α5 at the C terminus emanates from the wall to the outside of the helical rod ( Figure 2 J). Interestingly, at both ends of the PspA core, first at the tip of the hairpin between helix α1 and α2 (70–90) and second at the opposite end of helix α4 (167–180), we find highly conserved (>90% identity) residues among the PspA/IM30 family of proteins ( Figures 2 K, 2L, and S1 G) suggesting an evolutionary importance of these intersubunit stabilizing residues. Previously, mutation of these residues abolished formation of Syn IM30 rods, a closely related PspA homolog ( Hennig et al., 2015 35. Hennig, R. ∙ Heidrich, J. ∙ Saur, M. ... IM30 triggers membrane fusion in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7018 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saur et al., 2017 73. Saur, M. ∙ Hennig, R. ∙ Young, P. ... A Janus-Faced IM30 Ring Involved in Thylakoid Membrane Fusion Is Assembled from IM30 Tetramers Structure. 2017; 25 :1380-1390.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we mutated the hydrophobic residues A75 and A78 and analyzed the PspA_A75S/A78S preparations using negative staining EM. Although PspA_A75S/A78S is still able to form rod structures, our image data suggest that mutant rods are less stable, in particular after refolding in the presence of 75 mM NaSCN when the mutant does not form rods anymore ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Moreover, we computed the Coulomb potential of the atomic model PspA assembly and found that both ends show opposite charges with a basic and acidic surface, respectively ( Figure 2 M), resulting in a polar assembly that has very different binding surfaces at each end of the assembly.
Based on the determined cryo-EM structure of PspA, we found one particular structural feature (i.e., the helix α1/α2 hairpin packing against a perpendicular helix α5) reminiscent of previously resolved structures of eukaryotic membrane-remodeling ESCRT-III proteins. Therefore, we closely examined their apparent similarity by sequence alignment and compared cyanobacterial PspA and IM30 proteins with yeast Vps24 as well as human IST1 and CHMP1B ( Figure 3 ), for which high-resolution cryo-EM structures have been determined. Interestingly, there are several stretches that show high sequence similarities (quality score >4) ( Figure S2 C). Furthermore, structural superposition of the α1/α2 hairpin region yields Cα root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) with Eco PspA (PDB: 4WHE ) ( Osadnik et al., 2015 64. Osadnik, H. ∙ Schöpfel, M. ∙ Heidrich, E. ... PspF-binding domain PspA1-144 and the PspA·F complex: New insights into the coiled-coil-dependent regulation of AAA+ proteins Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 98 :743-759 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), IST1 (PDB: 6TZA ) ( Nguyen et al., 2020 63. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), CHMP1B (PDB: 6TZ9 ) ( Nguyen et al., 2020 63. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Vps24 (PDB: 6ZH3 ) ( Huber et al., 2020 36. Huber, S.T. ∙ Mostafavi, S. ∙ Mortensen, S.A. ... Structure and assembly of ESCRT-III helical Vps24 filaments Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 :eaba4897 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) reporting average RMSD values of 1.6 Å, 2.3 Å, 2.2 Å, and 1.8 Å, respectively ( Figure S2 D). CHMP1B, Vps24, and PspA adopt elongated conformations, whereas IST1’s structure was determined as a compact fold ( Figure 4 A). The corresponding resolved higher-order structures show that all of their assemblies remain unique ( Figure 4 B), whereas the fundamental organization of the α helices is conserved between all ESCRT-III proteins with helix-to-helix loops variations. Nevertheless, common to all structures is that the C-terminal helix α5 packs approx. perpendicularly against the α1/α2 hairpin motif ( Figure 4 C). Based on the identified structural similarities between the here-determined bacterial PspA cryo-EM structure and members of the eukaryotic ESCRT-III family, we conclude PspA may have shared evolutionary ancestry with ESCRT-III proteins.
Due to the observed structural homology of PspA with ESCRT-III proteins, we tested whether PspA has a membrane remodeling activity in analogy to the ESCRT proteins. Therefore, we incubated preformed PspA rods with small unilamellar (SUVs) vesicles prepared from E. coli polar lipid extract (EPL) and analyzed the mixture using cryo-EM. In the cryo-micrographs of the PspA/EPL mixtures, PspA rods in solution as well as a large fraction of vesicles with increased diameters of >2 μm were observed. The large vesicles often have round and elongated shapes, enclose smaller deformed vesicles, and can even have more complex internalized lipid structures ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S3 A). As expected, in the SUV control, we visualized a population of small vesicles with 20–200 nm diameters ( Figure 5 C). Vesicle dimension and perimeter measurements indicate a significant increase of membrane length upon addition of PspA rods ( Figures 5 D–5F), suggesting the fusion of several smaller vesicles into one large vesicle. In many cases, the lipid bilayer appears to be interrupted by fuzzy stretches that have PspA protein density as well as PspA rods associated with the membrane ( Figures 5 B and S3 B). Furthermore, when analyzing the membrane fine structure of large vesicles by 2D classification, the peak-to-peak separation of the bilayer increased from 3.0 to 5.4 nm on average when compared with the lipid samples alone ( Figures S3 C and S3D). Interestingly, the increased bilayer leaflet separation is only found in vesicles with perimeters larger than 175 nm, suggesting a post-fusion membrane structure induced by PspA. Additional micrographs of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) ( Figure S4 A) or the LUV/PspA mixture confirm the observation of an increased leaflet separation of 5.7 nm for fused vesicles ( Figures S4 B and S4C). In fact, when we analyzed the interaction of PspA with model membranes using fluorescence spectroscopy, we observed binding of PspA to negatively charged PG-containing membranes ( Figure 5 G), as well as net uncharged PC membranes ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Destabilized rods (PspA_A75S/A78S) also bound to model membranes, even with higher apparent affinity, supporting the observation that PspA membrane binding involves rod disassembly.
Next, we inspected a large dataset of 1,531 cryo-EM images of PspA rod structures in the presence of EPL SUVs in more detail ( Figure S5 C). Based on 2D classification, 65% of rods show a diameter of 275 Å, whereas only 35% share the narrower diameter at 220 Å observed in the PspA alone rod sample ( Figures S5 D and S5E). The wider rods (from here: PspA+EPL rods) show a different power spectrum as they form a two-start helix with 13.52 subunits per turn and a pitch of 59.9 Å ( Figure S5 F). Using these helical symmetry parameters, we determined a 7.2 Å cryo-EM density of PspA+EPL rods, which we could fit by the built atomic model of PspA ( Figures 5 H and S5 G–S5I). Notably, PspA+EPL rods enclose a density of lower but significant density forming a separate inner cylinder of ~40 Å thickness. Interestingly, the cryo-EM structure of PspA alone having a smaller diameter also has a pronounced inner density ( Figures S5 J and S5K), which we attribute to co-purified residual lipids. In addition, we observed a small tubular stalk that protrudes from helix α1 of strand B into the rod lumen ( Figure 5 I), which we interpreted as density for helix α0. Overall, the conformation of PspA determined from PspA+EPL and PspA rods share the same ESCRT-III fold ( Figures S5 L and S5M). The increased width of PspA+EPL rods is compatible with a lipid bilayer present in the inner lumen, which can also be observed in image slices of tomograms of PspA+EPL rods ( Figure S6 A). The experiments with preformed PspA rods and EPL show that the observed vesicle growth is consistent with a membrane remodeling activity, and wider rod structures can potentially accommodate a lipid bilayer in the lumen of the helical rod.
To study the effect of assembling PspA monomers on liposome membranes rather than preformed PspA rods, we designed a cleavage-inducible assembly variant of PspA (CIA-PspA) that is impaired in rod assembly due to the presence of a N-terminal NusA-tag ( Figure 6 A, left). When releasing the NusA-tag from PspA upon 3C protease cleavage, PspA monomers assemble into PspA rods. We found that CIA-PspA remodels liposomes into membrane tubules ( Figure 6 A, right) and observed μm-sized clusters of small and large deformed vesicles as well as PspA rods emanating from vesicles ( Figures 6 B, S6 B, and S6C). In analogy to the incubation with preformed PspA rods, we also observed a pronounced modification in bilayer leaflet separation up to 4.0 nm ( Figure S3 D, right). Cryo-tomographic slices ( Figure 6 C) of approximately 50% of CIA-PspA rods show clear tubular lipid bilayer density protruding from the vesicle into the lumen of the rods, whereas other smaller diameter CIA-PspA rods did not enclose tubular lipid bilayers ( Figure S6 D). Interestingly, the rods were always attached to small vesicles with a consistent polarity with respect to the vesicles. By superimposing the PspA+EPL rods with CIA-PspA rods in the tomographic slices, we infer that the rods attach to the vesicles with their negatively charged end ( Figures 6 C and S5 N). In conclusion, PspA rods can incorporate a lipid bilayer into the central lumen producing constricted positively curved membrane tubules.
However, mixtures of PspA and EPL SUVs have a broad distribution of vesicle sizes and membrane structures. In-depth analysis of a representative tomogram by continuous z slices reveals that multiple vesicles are often connected, thus forming an intricate system of membranous cisternae linked together by proteinaceous high-density zones (HDZ), where distinct lipid bilayer density is absent ( Figure 6 D; Video S1 ) giving rise to the observed fuzzy stretches in the 2D images described above. Nevertheless, HDZs can often be found close to areas of high lipid curvature at the cone-shaped and tubule-like ends of pear-shaped vesicles ( Figures 6 E and 6F). Close to HDZs, often internalized vesicles can be found connected to a larger vesicle suggesting an internal budding process ( Figure 6 G). Together with the observed structural ESCRT-III homology, co-reconstitution with lipids demonstrates that PspA is capable of mediating vesicle growth as well as membrane constriction and fission in dependence on the initial oligomeric state, and can, therefore, be considered a bona fide member of the ESCRT-III family of membrane remodeling proteins.

Section: Discussion

The propensity of PspA to form higher-order structures has been shown early on ( Hankamer et al., 2004 31. Hankamer, B.D. ∙ Elderkin, S.L. ∙ Buck, M. ... Organization of the AAA(+) adaptor protein PspA is an oligomeric ring J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :8862-8866 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kobayashi et al., 2007 44. Kobayashi, R. ∙ Suzuki, T. ∙ Yoshida, M. Escherichia coli phage-shock protein A (PspA) binds to membrane phospholipids and repairs proton leakage of the damaged membranes Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66 :100-109 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet how oligomerizations contributes to the basic physiological PspA function of maintaining membrane integrity remained uncertain. Here, we determined the 3.6 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of PspA rod assemblies and systematically studied the interaction of PspA with membranes. Due to similar structural and functional properties of PspA and eukaryotic ESCRT proteins, we identified PspA as a bacterial member of the evolutionary conserved ESCRT-III superfamily of membrane remodeling proteins.
Although EcoPspA forms rings rather than rods ( Hankamer et al., 2004 31. Hankamer, B.D. ∙ Elderkin, S.L. ∙ Buck, M. ... Organization of the AAA(+) adaptor protein PspA is an oligomeric ring J. Biol.

Escherichia coli phage-shock protein A (PspA) binds to membrane phospholipids and repairs proton leakage of the damaged membranes Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66 :100-109 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ), the physiological importance of ring versus rod structures remains an open question, because these structures have not been observed in their native context yet. Structurally, rods and rings are closely related, and conversion can be easily envisioned by accommodating small angular changes in subunit-subunit interactions. Using in vivo fluorescence microscopy, IM30 and PspA were shown to form dynamic localized puncta in Synechocystis and E. coli ( Engl et al., 2009 17. Engl, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Lloyd, L.J. ...

Microbiol. 2013; 87 :656-671 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is consistent with formation of rings, transient rod, or other higher-order structures associated with cellular membranes ( Junglas and Schneider, 2018 39. Junglas, B. ∙ Schneider, D. What is Vipp1 good for? Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 108 :1-5 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Siebenaller et al., 2019 74. Siebenaller, C. ∙ Junglas, B. ∙ Schneider, D. Functional Implications of Multiple IM30 Oligomeric States Front. Plant Sci. 2019; 10 :1500 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We and others ( Engl et al., 2009 17. Engl, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Lloyd, L.J. ... In vivo localizations of membrane stress controllers PspA and PspG in Escherichia coli Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73 :382-396 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) observed that such PspA assemblies were preferentially found at the cell poles, most likely to protect vulnerable cell membrane regions from dissipation of the proton motive force.
Due to revelation of PspA as a member of an ESCRT-III superfamily, we wondered whether there are more structural similarities beyond the identified homology and fold. Purified ESCRT-III proteins are known to assemble into a variety of large EM-observable structures, among them strings, rings, coils, sheets, filaments, and domes ( Bodon et al., 2011 7. Bodon, G. ∙ Chassefeyre, R. ∙ Pernet-Gallay, K. ... Charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B) of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) polymerizes into helical structures deforming the plasma membrane J. Biol.

Due to the large number of isoforms of eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins, the complexity of assembling hetero-complexes is significantly increased, and multiple combinations have been investigated ( Henne et al., 2011 34. Henne, W.M. ∙ Buchkovich, N.J. ∙ Emr, S.D. The ESCRT pathway Dev. Cell. 2011; 21 :77-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1118) PubMed Google Scholar ; Huber et al., 2020 36.

An ESCRT-III Polymerization Sequence Drives Membrane Deformation and Fission Cell. 2020; 182 :1140-1155.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). A structural motif of striking similarity found in PspA as well as in eukaryotic ESCRT structures is the perpendicular packing of helix α5 against the α1/α2 hairpin ( Figure 4 ). Additionally, helix α4 establishes important intersubunit contacts in the central core of the polymers, which is reflected in a stretch of residues with properties conserved between PspA/IM30 and ESCRT III proteins ( Figure 3 ). Although the AAA-ATPases PspF and Vps4 disassemble Eco PspA or eukaryotic ESCRTs, respectively, PspF is not encoded in Synechocystis , and other PspA-interacting ATPases have not been identified. Yet, a currently enigmatic ATPase may be involved in regulating the PspA activity in Synechocystis given the central importance of Vps4 in the ESCRT-III membrane remodeling pathway.
Despite the matching structural organization of PspA and ESCRT-III proteins, we further assessed whether PspA and ESCRT-III proteins have functional similarities. Consistent with the function of ESCRT-III being involved in membrane remodeling processes, PspA co-incubated with EPL revealed two noteworthy details: PspA binding to membrane surfaces induced a leaflet separation >5 nm and the appearance of remodeled liposomes. Observations include PspA-mediated vesicle growth as well as formation of membrane tubules and internalized membrane structures resulting from fusion, constriction, and fission events. The widening of the lipid bilayer likely is a consequence of PspA rod disassembly and the formation of a PspA carpet on the membrane surface, as recently described for IM30 ( Junglas et al., 2020 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Orru, R. ∙ Axt, A. ... IM30 IDPs form a membrane-protective carpet upon super-complex disassembly Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :595 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). As observed here, membrane adhesion and partial incorporation of PspA molecules into the membrane will lead to the thickening of the lipid bilayer. The observed bilayer structures could represent a protected form of the lipid bilayer minimizing, for instance, leakage of protons under imposed membrane stress conditions ( Junglas et al., 2020 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Orru, R. ∙ Axt, A. ... IM30 IDPs form a membrane-protective carpet upon super-complex disassembly Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :595 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kobayashi et al., 2007 44. Kobayashi, R. ∙ Suzuki, T. ∙ Yoshida, M. Escherichia coli phage-shock protein A (PspA) binds to membrane phospholipids and repairs proton leakage of the damaged membranes Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66 :100-109 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Electrostatic surface analysis of the PspA rod structure reveals an acidic and a basic end, which could provide a rationale for PspA’s observed preference of binding to negatively charged membrane surfaces ( Kobayashi et al., 2007 44. Kobayashi, R. ∙ Suzuki, T. ∙ Yoshida, M. Escherichia coli phage-shock protein A (PspA) binds to membrane phospholipids and repairs proton leakage of the damaged membranes Mol.

Membrane stored curvature elastic stress modulates recruitment of maintenance proteins pspa and vipp1 MBio. 2015; 6 :e01188-15 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 59. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Wallace, B.A. ... Structure and function of PspA and Vipp1 N-terminal peptides: Insights into the membrane stress sensing and mitigation Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, our membrane interaction studies show that PspA is also capable of binding to net uncharged membrane surfaces, and, therefore, membrane interaction of PspA appears to be less charge-dependent than observed for Syn IM30 ( Hennig et al., 2015 35. Hennig, R. ∙ Heidrich, J. ∙ Saur, M. ... IM30 triggers membrane fusion in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7018 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The imaged liposomes also show high-density zones devoid of any visible organized lipid bilayer structure, often with PspA rods attached to the vesicle surface. The corresponding regions contain a grainy texture suggestive of floating PspA molecules dissociated from the rod into smaller units. Because they make up the linkages of a continuous vesicular lipid network, they likely constitute lipid transfer zones (LTZs), enabling lipid movement between vesicles. In this role, LTZs may locally replace the bilayer structure while giving up the characteristic phospholipid barrier structure. In many aspects, the LTZs observed here and PspA’s membrane activity are reminiscent of the detergent-like membrane interaction of linear amphipathic antimicrobial peptides (for review, see Bechinger and Lohner, 2006 5. Bechinger, B. ∙ Lohner, K. Detergent-like actions of linear amphipathic cationic antimicrobial peptides Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758 :1529-1539 Crossref Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar ). In previous experiments, it has been observed that interaction of Syn IM30 with membranes disturbs the bilayer structure and allows small molecules to enter liposomes ( Hennig et al., 2015 35. Hennig, R. ∙ Heidrich, J. ∙ Saur, M. ... IM30 triggers membrane fusion in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7018 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), and an antimicrobial peptide-like activity has been discussed ( Thurotte and Schneider, 2019 81. Thurotte, A. ∙ Schneider, D. The fusion activity of IM30 rings involves controlled unmasking of the fusogenic core Front. Plant Sci. 2019; 10 :108 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, a detergent-like behavior of PspA does not exclude formation of stabilizing membrane carpets and formation of destabilizing pore-like structures within a membrane.
The cryo-EM structures of PspA and PspA+EPL rods determined here bear the most apparent similarity with the determined IST1/CHMP1B ESCRT-III assembly ( McCullough et al., 2015 57. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ... Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recently, IST1/CHMP1B could also be reconstituted with negatively charged lipids that were found in the lumen of the assembly ( Nguyen et al., 2020 63. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the presence of lipids, the diameter of the IST1/CHMP1B tubular assemblies increased from 240 to 280 Å leading to the hypothesis of high and low constriction states, respectively. In analogy to the IST1/CHMP1B as well as Chlamydomonas IM30/Vipp1 rods ( Theis et al., 2019 79. Theis, J. ∙ Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klingler, J. ... VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed that PspA rods can include lipid bilayers in the lumen, accompanied by changes in diameter from 220 to 275 Å, which therefore represent different constriction states. It is noteworthy that our preparations of PspA alone also revealed a significant variation of the diameters of the rods. This structural flexibility may be an important property of PspA to accommodate different bilayer intermediate configurations during the lipid interaction process. Furthermore, in the presence of lipids, we detected density for helix α0 in the PspA rod structure consistent with folding of N-terminal helix peptides of PspA and IM30 in the presence of lipid bilayers ( McDonald et al., 2015 58. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Ces, O. ... Membrane stored curvature elastic stress modulates recruitment of maintenance proteins pspa and vipp1 MBio. 2015; 6 :e01188-15 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 59. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Wallace, B.A. ... Structure and function of PspA and Vipp1 N-terminal peptides: Insights into the membrane stress sensing and mitigation Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, PspA rods are strong candidates for membrane remodeling proteins generating positive curvature, because IST1/CHMP1B and PspA assemblies share the same principal rod architecture, lipid topology, and changes in diameters.
In order to describe the biogenesis of the observed membrane fusion, constriction, and fission activities, we sorted the set of recorded membrane events to enable interpretation in a sequential manner. Initially, PspA assembles in rods free in solution or starting from a membrane anchored platform ( Figure 7 , top). The PspA+EPL intermediate resolution cryo-EM structure and cryo-tomograms show that these membrane-attached rods incorporate lipid bilayer tubules into the observed wider structures. The polar rods grow at the positively charged ends at the tip until they may encounter other free vesicles containing negatively charged lipids. In this contact area, ordered PspA rods start to disassemble at their positive end and initiate formation of LTZs, connecting two vesicular structures ( Figure 7 , center). After this docking event, the vesicular lobes form the structure resembling an hourglass linked by the PspA LTZ. This hourglass structure likely represents a critical switch structure that we propose can undergo two principal pathways: in the first case, lipid movement is allowed over the LTZ and the donor membrane of vesicle 1 is in close spatial proximity to the acceptor membrane of vesicle 2. Then, lipid transfer across a newly formed continuous lipid structure can take place thereby fusing the bilayers of vesicle 1 and 2. Upon relaxation of the lipid bilayer structure, larger vesicles consisting of the fused membranes of vesicle 1 and 2 have formed ( Figure 7 , bottom left). In the second case, lipid movement is allowed over the LTZ and the donor membrane of vesicle 1 is not in closest spatial proximity to the membrane of vesicle 2. Here, the membranes of vesicles 1 and 2 do not form a continuous bilayer, and as a result, the membrane of vesicle 1 buds into the lumen of vesicle 2, resulting in two separate membrane systems. In consequence, a cross-membrane transfer of vesicle 1 into the lumen of vesicle 2 and membrane fission is observed ( Figure 7 , bottom right), reminiscent of ESCRT-III inward vesicle budding events. We would like to point out that in our in vitro reconstituted samples, we classified these two principal cases, although we also observed multiple intermediate events and combinations of these two outlined pathways (e.g., including a symmetric cross-membrane vesicle transfer and multiple others) ( Figure S7 ). According to this fusion-fission switch model, the critical step that determines the fate of fusion or fission may be the spatial proximity of the donor and acceptor membrane that enables or disables the formation of a continuous lipid bilayer. In both of the described activities, PspA’s mode of action results from the ability to move lipids across the LTZ.
The fusion-fission switch model described here explains a multitude of the observed membrane activities of PspA. Upon occurrence of membrane leakage, PspA-induced vesicle growth can potentially patch disturbed membranes and restore full membrane integrity thereby protecting bacterial membranes, because it has been hypothesized previously for the bacterial dynamin-like protein DynA after treatment of membranes with pore-forming agents ( Guo and Bramkamp, 2019 27. Guo, L. ∙ Bramkamp, M. Bacterial dynamin-like protein DynA mediates lipid and content mixing FASEB J. 2019; 33 :11746-11757 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to this active repair mechanism, PspA likely is also capable of passive membrane protection by forming a protective carpet on membranes, as described above. Furthermore, PspA-induced cross-membrane vesicle transfer can result in the formation of intricate internalized membrane systems reminiscent of thylakoid membrane stacks that are known to be mediated by the PspA homolog IM30 ( Heidrich et al., 2017 32. Heidrich, J. ∙ Thurotte, A. ∙ Schneider, D. Specific interaction of IM30/Vipp1 with cyanobacterial and chloroplast membranes results in membrane remodeling and eventually in membrane fusion Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :537-549 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vothknecht et al., 2012 84. Vothknecht, U.C. ∙ Otters, S. ∙ Hennig, R. ... Vipp1: a very important protein in plastids?! J. Exp. Bot. 2012; 63 :1699-1712 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, inward vesicle budding, as it has been attributed to eukaryotic ESCRT-III action during multivesicular body biogenesis, could also be envisioned by the process of cross-membrane vesicle transfer. In case PspA’s mode of action was transferable to eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins, the determined structure of IST1/CHMP1B polymer would be directly compatible, because it has also been shown to bind lipids in the lumen of the assembly. In contrast to lipid reconstitutions mediated by several eukaryotic ESCRT proteins, the homo-oligomer of PspA alone induces large-scale changes to liposome morphology, including growth, constriction, and cross-membrane vesicle transfer. Thereby, it represents a minimal bacterial membrane remodeling system that is capable of triggering membrane fusion and fission in vitro .
This study establishes that PspA is a member of the membrane remodeling ESCRT-III protein family. In support, this membership has just now been confirmed for PspA-related bacterial IM30/Vipp1 proteins by two independent studies: first, derived from bioinformatic analysis and followed by single-particle cryo-EM of IM30/Vipp1 rings revealed a conserved ESCRT-III fold ( Liu et al., 2021 50. Liu, J. ∙ Tassinari, M. ∙ Souza, D.P. ... Bacterial Vipp1 and PspA are members of the ancient ESCRT-III membrane-remodeling superfamily Cell. 2021; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell ]). Second, the cryo-EM single-particle structure of IM30/Vipp1 rings as well as in situ cryo-EM studies revealed the presence of Vipp1 rods in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( Gupta et al., 2021 28. Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klumpe, S. ∙ Gries, K. ... Structural basis for VIPP1 oligomerization and maintenance of thylakoid membrane integrity Cell. 2021; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell ]). These studies also show the structural diversity, because IM30/Vipp1 forms rings in cyanobacteria, whereas cyanobacterial PspA and IM30/Vipp1 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii form rods. The physiological impact and consequences of rings versus rods are currently still open questions. Based on cryo-electron tomography analyses, using PspA reconstituted with membranes, we here propose a sequence of events leading to either membrane fusion or fission. However, this sequence was not directly determined by our cryo-EM experiment. Instead, the model was derived from images that were assembled in a sequence, showing the recorded structures as putative stages of a continuous membrane remodeling process. Short-lived intermediates, however, are notoriously difficult to capture by cryo-EM and, therefore, could be missing in our model. In addition, the PspA rod structures determined here do not allow the detailed description of the molecular mechanism of membrane remodeling. When lipid tubule density was present in the PspA EPL structure, helix α0 was detectable, yet the exact conformations of the lipid-interacting residues remain open at the given resolution. The prominent role of the helix α1/α2 hairpin (α2/α3 in IM30 nomenclature) in membrane fusion or fission, as identified analyzing the closely related Synechocystis IM30/Vipp1 ( Thurotte and Schneider, 2019 81. Thurotte, A. ∙ Schneider, D. The fusion activity of IM30 rings involves controlled unmasking of the fusogenic core Front. Plant Sci. 2019; 10 :108 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), could not be directly visualized or clarified here. Moreover, how PspA interaction gives rise to the increased bilayer thickness in the observed post-fusion membranes remains unclear. Better resolution of these intermediate structures could reveal the exact paths leading to fusion or fission and may even clarify how the PspA membrane remodeling machinery also accomplishes the different roles of membrane protection in vivo ( Kleerebezem et al., 1996 42. Kleerebezem, M. ∙ Crielaard, W. ∙ Tommassen, J.

Our study reveals many functional details on PspA’s membrane remodeling activities based on cryo-EM structures, while it also raises a series of new questions on the functional relationship between bacterial PspA/IM30/LiaH and the eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins: are the observed PspA’s remodeling activities fully transferable to the diversity of activities of eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins? Do even the prokaryotic IM30 or LiaH share the same mechanisms of membrane remodeling? Do, in analogy to eukaryotic ESCRT-III, regulators exist in vivo that direct PspA’s membrane remodeling activities to fulfill different functions in membrane organization, repair, and maintenance? To address these open questions, it will be important to conduct further mechanistic studies, including structural work, to develop a more general framework for the membrane remodeling activity of the ESCRT-III protein family as a whole.

The EMDB accession numbers for the 3.6 Å resolution cryo-EM map and PspA model are EMD: 11698 and PDB: 7ABK. The 7.2 Å map of PspA in the presence of E. coli polar lipids has the EMD:12733 ID.
E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and E. coli ΔpspA K-12 JW1297 strain ( Baba et al., 2006 4. Baba, T. ∙ Ara, T. ∙ Hasegawa, M. ... Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2 :2006.0008 Crossref Scopus (5912) PubMed Google Scholar ) via an inducible L-arabinose promotor were used in this study. For recombinant protein expression, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells carrying the respective expression plasmid (pRSET_SynPspA, pRSET_SynPspA_A75S/A78S or pET50b_SynPspA) were grown to an OD 600 of 0.6 - 0.8 at 37°C in TB or LB medium plus antibiotics. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 or 1 mM IPTG and overnight incubation at 30°C. E. coli ΔpspA K-12 JW1297 strain and E. coli ΔpspA K-12 JW1297 cells carrying the pBAD_SynPspA-YFP plasmid were grown overnight in LB medium at 37°C. The preculture was diluted 1:100 in fresh LB to an OD 600 of 0.45. SynPspA-YFP expression was induced by addition of 0.02% L-arabinose. 30 min after induction, samples were taken for fluorescence microscopy imaging.
PspA wt ( slr1188 ) of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and PspA_A75S/A78S were heterologously expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells in LB or TB medium using a pRSET6 plasmid.
For native extraction of PspA rods, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer I (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and lysed in a cell disruptor (TS Constant Cell disruption systems 1.1 KW; Constant Systems). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 g. The cleared lysate was incubated overnight at 4°C. Rods were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 1000 mM NaCl at pH 7.6. The resulting suspension was concentrated by ultracentrifugation (Vivaspin centrifugal filter units MWCO 10 kDa) and washed thoroughly with 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6. The crude rod extract was further purified by differential centrifugation: large particles and aggregates were sedimented by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 g; shorter rods by centrifugation for 60 min at 49,000 g. As a final polishing step, the rods were diluted and incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 overnight. Again, large particles and aggregates were removed by low-speed centrifugation for 60 min at 20,000 g; rods were pelleted and washed twice with 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6.
For purification of PspA and PspA_A75S/A78S under denaturing conditions, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 6 M urea (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, 1% CHAPS (w/w), 75 mM NaSCN, pH 7.6) supplemented with a protease inhibitor. Cells were lysed in a cell disruptor (TS Constant Cell disruption systems 1.1 KW; Constant Systems) or by tip-sonication (Branson sonifier). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 g. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads on an overhead shaker for 1 - 2 h at 4°C. The Ni-NTA matrix was washed with lysis buffer II, wash buffer I (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, 1% CHAPS (w/w), 75 mM NaSCN, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.6) and wash buffer II (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 75 mM NaSCN, 6 M urea, 60 mM imidazole, pH 7.6). The protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA beads with elution buffer I (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 75 mM NaSCN, 4 M urea, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.6). The fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 (100 kDa MWCO). When necessary, protein was concentrated by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 1 h followed by carefully resuspending the pellet in the desired volume of sodium phosphate buffer.
For the cleavage-induced assembly experiments, PspA was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells in TB medium using a pET50b plasmid. The pET50b plasmid contains an N-terminal NusA-tag connected to the insert via a 6x His-tag and a 3C cleavage site. For purification of the NusA-PspA fusion protein, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer I supplemented with a protease inhibitor. Cells were lysed in a cell disruptor (TS Constant Cell disruption systems 1.1 KW; Constant Systems). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 g. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads on an overhead shaker for 30 min at 4°C. The Ni-NTA matrix was washed with lysis buffer, wash buffer III (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.6) and wash buffer IV (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 60 mM imidazole, pH 7.6). The protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA beads with elution buffer II (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 1000 mM Imidazole, pH 7.6). The fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 (100 kDa MWCO). When necessary, protein was concentrated by ultracentrifugation (Vivaspin centrifugal filter units MWCO 30 kDa). After the purification procedure, proteins were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until use at −20°C.
Chloroform dissolved E. coli polar lipid (EPL) extract, DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), and DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1’-rac-glycerol)) were purchased from Avanti polar lipids. Lipid films were produced by evaporating the solvent under a gentle stream of nitrogen and vacuum desiccation overnight. The lipid films were rehydrated in 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 by shaking for 30 mins at 37°C. The resulting liposome solution was subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles, combined with sonication at 37°C in a bath sonicator. SUVs (small unilamellar vesicles) or LUVs (large unilamellar vesicles) were generated by extrusion of the liposome solution through a porous polycarbonate filter (50 nm or 400 nm pores). For cryo-EM analyses, PspA rods (0.8 mg/mL) were incubated with EPL vesicles (5 mg/mL) for at least 2 h at room temperature.
In order to analyze the membrane binding propensities of PspA, liposomes containing 100% DOPC or a mixture of 40 mol% DOPG and 60 mol% DOPC, each containing additionally 0.2 mol% of the fluorescent dye Laurdan (6-Dodecanoyl-N,N-dimethyl-2-naphthylamine, from Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany), were prepared from lipid films as described above. The fluorescent properties of Laurdan depend on the membrane structure, and changes in the membrane state, here caused by membrane binding of PspA, can be used to assess the membrane binding of proteins ( Heidrich et al., 2016 33. Heidrich, J. ∙ Wulf, V. ∙ Hennig, R. ... Organization into higher ordered ring structures counteracts membrane binding of IM30, a protein associated with inner membranes in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :14954-14962 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the five freeze-thaw cylces, PspA was added to the liposome solution with a final concentration of 100 μM lipid, and protein concentrations as indicated. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, corrected fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a Jasco FP8500 fluorescence spectrometer (Jasco, Pfungstadt, Germany), with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an increment of 1 nm. GP (generalized polarization) values ( Parasassi et al., 1990 65. Parasassi, T. ∙ De Stasio, G. ∙ d’Ubaldo, A. ... Phase fluctuation in phospholipid membranes revealed by Laurdan fluorescence Biophys. J. 1990; 57 :1179-1186 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (659) PubMed Google Scholar ) were calculated based on the mean intensities recorded in the wavelength interval 438-442 nm and 488-492 nm, yielding I 440 and I 490 , respectively, according to GP = (I 440 -I 490 )/(I 440 +I 490 ). A one-site binding model was used to determine the apparent affinity (K D ) of PspA to lipid membranes.
For the generation of CIA-PspA rods, NusA-PspA was cleaved by 3C protease to produce NusA and free PspA. The reaction was conducted in the presence of EPL vesicles: A mixture of NusA-PspA (1 mg/mL), EPL SUVs (5 mg/mL) and 3C protease (0.5 mg/mL) was incubated at 37°C with shaking for at least 2 h. Samples of the reaction mixture were analyzed by cryo-EM.
For fluorescence microscopy, PspA wt and mutant were genetically fused to a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP, Venus) ( Nagai et al., 2002 62. Nagai, T. ∙ Ibata, K. ∙ Park, E.S. ... A variant of yellow fluorescent protein with fast and efficient maturation for cell-biological applications Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20 :87-90 Crossref Scopus (2267) PubMed Google Scholar ) and expressed using a pBAD vector (Invitrogen) (pBAD_SynPspA-YFP). Proteins were expressed at a low level in an E. coli ΔpspA K-12 JW1297 strain ( Baba et al., 2006 4. Baba, T. ∙ Ara, T. ∙ Hasegawa, M. ... Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2 :2006.0008 Crossref Scopus (5912) PubMed Google Scholar ) via addition of 0.02% L-arabinose. 5 μL cell suspension with an OD 600 = 0.6 were added to 2% agarose pads on a microscope glass slide, and PspA-YFP localization was analyzed using an inverted phase contrast fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1). Fluorescence microscopy images shown in Figure S1 A are composites of bright field images and YFP-channel images (excitation filter 450 - 490 nm, emission filter 500 - 550 nm, 500 ms exposure time).
For negative staining electron microscopy, 3 μL sample was applied to glow-discharged (PELCO easiGlow Glow Discharger,Ted Pella Inc.) continuous carbon grids (CF-300 Cu, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The sample was incubated on the grid for 1 min. Then the grid was side-blotted using filter paper, washed with 3 μL water and stained with 3 μL 2% uranyl acetate for 30 s and air-dried. The grids were imaged with a 120 kV Talos L120C electron microscope (ThermoFischer Scientific/FEI) equipped with a CETA camera at a pixel size of 4.06 Å/pixel (36,000 x magnification) at an underfocus of 1.0 to 2.5 μm.
Samples for the full high-resolution dataset of PspA rods were prepared by applying 3 μL PspA rods (~7.9 mg/mL) to glow-discharged (PELCO easiGlow Glow Discharger, Ted Pella Inc.) Quantifoil grids (R1.2/1.3 Cu 200 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a ThermoFisher Scientific Vitrobot Mark IV set to 90% humidity at 10°C (blotting force −10, blotting time 3 s). A total of 8,342 micrographs were recorded on a 200 kV Talos Arctica G2 (ThermoFisher Scientific) electron microscope equipped with a Bioquantum K3 (Gatan) detector operated by SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 56. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Micrographs were collected as 50-frame movies in superresolution mode at 0.419 Å/pixel and a cumulative dose of 50 e − /Å 2 and a nominal underfocus of 0.2 to 2.3 μm. Samples of an initial cryo-electron microscopy dataset used for symmetry determination were prepared on Lacey Carbon grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and imaged using a Titan Krios (300 kV, FEG) cryo-electron microscope (FEI/Thermo Fischer Scientific), equipped with a Gatan Quantum K2 energy-filtered direct detector. A total of 936 micrographs with a pixel size of 1.35 Å were collected at an underfocus range from 0.8 to 2.6 μm. For cryo-EM of the PspA-liposome mixtures, 3.5 μL sample were applied to glow-discharged (PELCO easiGlow Glow Discharger, Ted Pella Inc.) lacey carbon Cu 200 mesh grids or R2/2 Cu 300 mesh grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Excess sample was manually blotted at the back side of the grid for 12 s using filter paper. Plunge-freezing in liquid ethane was performed using a ThermoFisher Scientific Vitrobot Mark IV, set at 100% humidity and 22°C temperature. Frozen grids were stored at liquid nitrogen temperature before usage. Grids were imaged on a 200 kV Talos Arctica G2 (ThermoFisher Scientific) electron microscope equipped with a Bioquantum K3 (Gatan) detector (or with a CETA camera at a pixel size of 2.53 Å/pixel for LUV imaging). For the SUVs (1525 micrographs), SUVs+PspA (1531 micrographs) and SUVs+CIA-PspA (1889 micrographs) datasets micrographs were collected as 50-frame movies in superresolution mode at 0.681 Å/pixel and a cumulative dose of 30 to 32 e − /Å 2 and a nominal underfocus of 2.0 to 3.0 μm.
Before plunge freezing, 5 nm BSA-Gold fiducials (OD 75, 1:50 (v/v)) were added to each incubation mixture directly. Samples were prepared by applying 3.5 μL sample solution to glow-discharged (PELCO easiGlow Glow Discharger, Ted Pella Inc.) lacey carbon Cu 200 mesh grids or R2/2 Cu 300 mesh grids ((Electron Microscopy Sciences). The excess of liquid was removed by manually back-side blotting for 12 s. Grids were immediately vitrified by plunge freezing in liquid ethane at 77 K using a ThermoFisher Scientific Vitrobot Mark IV operated at 100% humidity and 22°C temperature. Frozen grids were stored at liquid nitrogen temperature before usage. Electron microscopy was performed using a Talos Arctica G2 (ThermoFisher Scientific), equipped with a Bioquantum K3 (Gatan), at 200 kV. Tilt series were acquired using a dose symmetric scheme ( Hagen et al., 2017 30. Hagen, W.J.H. ∙ Wan, W. ∙ Briggs, J.A.G. Implementation of a cryo-electron tomography tilt-scheme optimized for high resolution subtomogram averaging J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :191-198 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ), starting at 0° and alternating tilts to ± 60° with an angular increment of 2° at a nominal underfocus of 3.0 μm, in superresolution mode and dose fractionation (up to 6 frames/image), with an object pixel size of 1.362 Å/pixel. The accumulated electron dose for each tilt series did not exceed 120 e - /Å 2 . SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 56. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for automated data acquisition.
The detailed helical reconstruction processing workflow is presented in Figures S1 B–S1D. In order to determine the symmetry parameters, a small dataset of 936 micrographs was utilized (Titan Krios/K2) and PspA rods were picked manually in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 93. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ) and segmented with a step size of 35 Å into 39,600 windows (Test Dataset A, Figure S1 D). The segments were subjected to two rounds of 2D classification. Only classes showing clear secondary structure features and consistent widths were selected. The helical symmetry was determined by analyzing layer lines in the power spectra of the best 2D class and several possible symmetry solutions were obtained using SEGCLASSRECONSTRUCT from the SPRING package ( Desfosses et al., 2014 14. Desfosses, A. ∙ Ciuffa, R. ∙ Gutsche, I. ... SPRING – An image processing package for single-particle based helical reconstruction from electron cryomicrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2014; 185 :15-26 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Those symmetry solutions were tested systematically in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 93. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the initial symmetry parameters of 30 Å pitch with 10.25 units per turn, the refinement yielded a map with secondary structure features at 7.3 Å resolution whereas other solutions did not. This initial model was further refined by two rounds of 3D classifications in RELION 3.0. This procedure resulted in an intermediate map of 6.1 Å resolution (FSC = 0.143) and refined helical symmetry parameters with a 30.1 Å pitch and 10.19 units per turn corresponding to 2.9 Å rise and 35.3° rotation.
Acquired frames of the full 8,342 micrograph dataset (Talos Arctica/K3) ( Figure S1 D) were preprocessed in WARP by binning to the physical pixel size of 0.839 Å/pixel, frame alignment and correcting for beam-induced motion and stage drift ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 77. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ). A subset of the resulting micrographs was subjected to manual filament tracing using E2HELIXBOXER ( Ludtke, 2016 52. Ludtke, S.J. Single-Particle Refinement and Variability Analysis in EMAN2.1 Meth. Enzymol. 2016; 579 :159-189 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Manually traced filaments were used for neural network training and subsequent automated tracing with crYOLO 1.5 ( Wagner et al., 2019, 2020 85. Wagner, T. ∙ Lusnig, L. ∙ Pospich, S. ... Two particle-picking procedures for filamentous proteins: SPHIRE-crYOLO filament mode and SPHIRE-STRIPER Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2020; 76 :613-620 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar 86. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ). This way, a total of 55,800 rods were detected. After contrast-transfer function (CTF) determination of the micrographs with CTFFIND 4.1 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 70. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ) and selection of micrographs based on ice quality and image drift (8,257 micrographs), 1.5 million segments (à 450 pixel dimension, at a step size of seven asymmetric units given the 3 Å rise) were extracted from these rods in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 93. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a first round of 2D classification, junk particles and classes showing segments with widths > 23 nm and < 19 nm were discarded and only classes showing clear secondary structure features and power spectra were chosen for further processing (Dataset B, 334,000 segments, Figure S1 D). A simulated helical cylinder was created from the symmetry parameters (2.9 Å rise and 35.2° rotation obtained from Test Dataset A) and used as a reference for 3D classification. This initial reference was further refined by several rounds of 3D classification and subsequent 3D refinement. Finally, one 3D class resulted in a map showing clear pitch in the α helices at 4.7 Å resolution (19,900 segments). The segments of this class were subjected to multiple rounds of per-particle CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing and 3D auto-refinement focusing on the central 30% of the cylinder using a mask. Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves were calculated within the mask containing the central 30% of the density and local resolutions were determined using RELION’s implementation and rendered in ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 26. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2591) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final map was determined to have a global resolution of 3.6 Å (FSC = 0.143) (helical symmetry: 2.9 Å rise and 35.3° twist).
For helical reconstruction of PspA in presence of EPL SUVs, a dataset of 1531 micrographs was analyzed using cryoSPARC v3.1 ( Punjani et al., 2017 69. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4029) PubMed Google Scholar ). Super-resolution movie frames were corrected for beam-induced motion and stage drift, aligned and binned to the physical pixel size of 1.362 Å/pixel. After CTF estimation (using patch-CTF estimation), 17 micrographs were used to manually pick rods and subsequently segmented. 2D averages from those segments were used as templates for automated filament tracing. 917,000 segments were extracted (à 350 pixel dimension, at a step size 30 Å). In a first round of 2D classification, junk particles and poorly aligned particles were discarded. The resulting 548,000 segments were subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classifications to sort them in two major rod classes ( Figures S5 C–S5E). Class A contained 155,000 segments and class B contained 291,000 segments. Initial 3D volumes for both rod classes were generated starting from a cylinder with 220 Å and 275 Å diameter, respectively. The initial 3D volumes were used for helical symmetry searches using cryoSPARC. The symmetry search outcome was used as starting point for helical refinement starting with the best reconstruction/symmetry parameters and subjecting it iteratively to another symmetry search/helical refinement. Class A yielded a minimum at 2.9 Å rise and 35.2° twist and was refined to 7.7 Å global resolution. At this resolution level, class A was indistinguishable from the reconstruction of PspA alone. Class B yielded a minimum at 4.4 Å rise and 26.6° twist. The helical symmetry was validated by comparing the power spectrum of 2D class averages with simulated layer lines of the identified helical symmetry using SPRING ( Figure S5 E). Class B was refined to 7.15 Å global resolution using dynamic masking with a z-clip fraction of 0.4.
The handedness of the final reconstruction of PspA alone was validated by rigid-body fitting the X-ray structure of the Eco PspA hairpin structure ( Osadnik et al., 2015 64. Osadnik, H. ∙ Schöpfel, M. ∙ Heidrich, E. ... PspF-binding domain PspA1-144 and the PspA·F complex: New insights into the coiled-coil-dependent regulation of AAA+ proteins Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 98 :743-759 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB: 4WHE) by Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 66. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera—A visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 3D reconstruction was B-factor sharpened (B = −98 Å 2 ) in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 93. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ), autosharpened in phenix.auto_sharpen ( Liebschner et al., 2019; Terwilliger et al., 2020 49. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3349) PubMed Google Scholar 78. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Ludtke, S.J. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Improvement of cryo-EM maps by density modification Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :923-927 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ) in Phenix 1.16-3549 and FDR-FSC filtered using SPOC ( Beckers and Sachse, 2020 6. Beckers, M. ∙ Sachse, C. Permutation testing of Fourier shell correlation for resolution estimation of cryo-EM maps J. Struct. Biol. 2020; 212 :107579 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting three maps were used for de novo model building in Coot 0.9 ( Emsley et al., 2010 18. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) for residues 22 - 217. Refinement was performed in phenix.real_space_refine ( Afonine et al., 2018a 2. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ) against the phenix.auto_sharpen map after symmetry neighbors were created with phenix.apply_ncs (Helical 35.3°; 2.9 Å) using default parameters. After two cycles of refinement and manual inspection, the final model was validated in phenix.validation_cryoem ( Afonine et al., 2018b 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Klaholz, B.P. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... New tools for the analysis and validation of cryo-EM maps and atomic models Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :814-840 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S1 ).
The handedness of the reconstruction of PspA+EPL (class B) was validated by rigid-body fitting the structure of PspA alone by Chimera. To adjust the structure of PspA alone to the new reconstruction α1+2, α3, α4 and α5 were treated as separate bodies and fitted to the density map and the loop regions were recreated using MODELER ( Šali and Blundell, 1993 72. Šali, A. ∙ Blundell, T.L. Comparative Protein Modelling by Satisfaction of Spatial Restraints J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234 :779-815 Crossref Scopus (11015) PubMed Google Scholar ). PspA+EPL (class B) was built as a two-start helix, with one strand showing density extending from helix α1 to the inner volume of the rod. An ideal α-helix was built representing helix α0 using Chimera and fitted to this density, followed by building the loop between α0 and α1 with MODELER. By this approach, we obtained a nearly full-length model of PspA including residues 1-217.
The Coulomb potential of a PspA 10-mer (PspA alone) and a PspA 14-mer (PspA+EPL class B) was calculated in Chimera using the built-in “Coulombic Surface Coloring” routine with standard settings. The resulting electrostatic potential grid was sampled on the surface of PspA maps in ChimeraX. Structure rendering was done in ChimeraX or Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2018; Pettersen et al., 2004 26. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2591) PubMed Google Scholar 66. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera—A visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ). Image processing, helical reconstruction and model building was completed using SBGrid-supported applications ( Morin et al., 2013 60. Morin, A. ∙ Eisenbraun, B. ∙ Key, J. ... Collaboration gets the most out of software eLife. 2013; 2 :e01456 Crossref Scopus (682) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Frame alignment and averaging was done in WARP ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 77. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 101 tilt series were analyzed (SUVs: 8, SUVs+PspA: 41, SUVs+CIA-PspA: 52). Tilt series were aligned using gold fiducial markers and down-sampled tomograms were reconstructed ((10.8 Å) 3 /voxel) by back projection using the IMOD package ( Kremer et al., 1996 46. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer Visualization of Three-Dimensional Image Data Using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (4018) PubMed Google Scholar ). Membranes and associated densities were semi-automatically segmented using a tensor voting algorithm TomoSegMemTV ( Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2014 55. Martinez-Sanchez, A. ∙ Garcia, I. ∙ Asano, S. ... Robust membrane detection based on tensor voting for electron tomography J. Struct. Biol. 2014; 186 :49-61 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Output labels were further segmented by visual inspection in combination with denoised tomograms (anisotropic diffusion filtering; diffusion stop threshold 0.3; number of iterations 3) using Amira 2020.2 (FEI SAS/ThermoFisher Scientific). Density profiles of PspA rods were measured using ImageJ ( Rueden et al., 2017 71. Rueden, C.T. ∙ Schindelin, J. ∙ Hiner, M.C. ... ImageJ2: ImageJ for the next generation of scientific image data BMC Bioinformatics. 2017; 18 :529 Crossref Scopus (4005) PubMed Google Scholar ). They were taken perpendicularly to the rod axis at the central position after averaging 5 slices in z direction and over 100 pixel of rod length.
To quantitatively assess the size and size changes of EPL vesicles upon addition of PspA, minimum and maximum widths of liposomes, as well as their perimeter, were measured using ImageJ ( Rueden et al., 2017 71. Rueden, C.T. ∙ Schindelin, J. ∙ Hiner, M.C. ... ImageJ2: ImageJ for the next generation of scientific image data BMC Bioinformatics. 2017; 18 :529 Crossref Scopus (4005) PubMed Google Scholar ). Statistical analyses of the vesicle perimeters were done by testing the null hypothesis (two sample t test) for each pair of the subsets (EPL, EPL+PspA, EPL+PspA (d > 5 nm)) as implemented in OriginPro 2020b. To determine the bilayer leaflet distance, micrographs of the vesicle containing samples ((EPL (1525 micrographs), EPL+PspA (1531 micrographs) and EPL+CIA-PspA (1889 micrographs)) were analyzed using cryoSPARC v3.1 ( Punjani et al., 2017 69. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4029) PubMed Google Scholar ). Super-resolution movie frames were corrected for beam-induced motion and stage drift, aligned and binned to the physical pixel size of 1.362 Å/pixel. After CTF estimation (using patch-CTF estimation), 12-36 micrographs were used to manually pick bilayers and subsequently segmented. 2D averages from those segments were used as templates for automated filament tracing. 139,000 (EPL), 832,000 (EPL+PspA) and 4.6 million (EPL+CIA-PspA) segments were extracted (à 200 pixel dimension, at a step size 10 Å). Multiple rounds of 2D classifications were used to remove junk particles and poorly aligned particles. The final subsets contained 99,000 (EPL), 451,000 (EPL+PspA) and 3.8 million (EPL+CIA-PspA) segments in 7-22 classes ( Figure S3 C).
For analysis of LUVs, the bilayer was traced manually in RELION 3.0 using the filament-picking option ( Zivanov et al., 2018 93. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). From these traces, segments were extracted every 20 Å with a box size of 100 px at 2.53 Å/pixel yielding 9,963 segments of vesicles only, 8,571 segments of small vesicles and PspA and 17,056 segments of large vesicles and PspA. Bilayer segments were CTF corrected based on micrograph CTF determination (CTFFIND 4.1) ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 70. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequently subjected to 2D classification in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 93. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S4 B and S4C).
Relative density profiles of the class averages were analyzed in OriginPro 2020b using the “Multiple Peak Fit” tool with a Gauss peak function. The leaflet distance d was measured as the distance between two peak centers in each class average. Leaflet distances of the classes were binned in 0.5 nm groups and plotted versus their relative frequency in each group ( Figures S3 C, S3D, and S4 B).
Data and statistical analysis were performed using OriginPro 2020b (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, USA). Detailed descriptions of quantifications and statistical analyses (exact values of n , dispersion and precision measures used and statistical tests used) can be found in the respective Figures, Figure legends and Methods section.
