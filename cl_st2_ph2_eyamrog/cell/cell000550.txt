Title: Mucosal fungi promote gut barrier function and social behavior via Type 17 immunity


Abstract: Summary

Fungal communities (the mycobiota) are an integral part of the gut microbiota, and the disruption of their integrity contributes to local and gut-distal pathologies. Yet, the mechanisms by which intestinal fungi promote homeostasis remain unclear. We characterized the mycobiota biogeography along the gastrointestinal tract and identified a subset of fungi associated with the intestinal mucosa of mice and humans. Mucosa-associated fungi (MAF) reinforced intestinal epithelial function and protected mice against intestinal injury and bacterial infection. Notably, intestinal colonization with a defined consortium of MAF promoted social behavior in mice. The gut-local effects on barrier function were dependent on IL-22 production by CD4 + T helper cells, whereas the effects on social behavior were mediated through IL-17R-dependent signaling in neurons. Thus, the spatial organization of the gut mycobiota is associated with host-protective immunity and epithelial barrier function and might be a driver of the neuroimmune modulation of mouse behavior through complementary Type 17 immune mechanisms.

Section: Introduction

A diverse community of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi coexist within the mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) tract ( Hall et al., 2017 39. Hall, A.B. ∙ Tolonen, A.C. ∙ Xavier, R.J. Human genetic variation and the gut microbiome in disease Nat. Rev. Genet. 2017; 18 :690-699 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ). The physiology of the intestine varies dramatically along its length, forming unique environmental niches and creating a distinct microbiota biogeography that shapes the dynamics of microbial interactions with the host ( Costello et al., 2019 23.

The distance from the intestinal mucosa adds another dimension, allowing further differentiation between luminal (LUM) and mucosa-associated microbiota (MAF). MAF have the ability to induce host-protective immunity through direct interaction with the underlying epithelium and mucosal immune cells ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7.

The spatial organization of the microbiota, including altered longitudinal distribution or translocation of LUM species into the mucosa, might represent an important factor contributing to several inflammatory, metabolic, and cognitive diseases ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7.

In addition to bacteria that can influence a wide range of physiological processes ranging from immune development to behavior, a growing body of research suggests an involvement of intestinal fungi in the modulation of immune homeostasis ( Doron et al., 2021a 29.

Here, we initially characterized the biogeography of the fungal communities along the GI tract and identified a subset of fungi associated with the intestinal mucosa in both laboratory mice and humans. In contrast to bacterial communities, mycobiota showed a stronger clustering based on the LUM versus mucosal sampling site rather than on the longitudinal location. A defined consortium of MAF, but not a luminal fungal consortium, exerted an immunoprotective effect on the gut by increasing the barrier function and transcription of epithelial genes involved in JAK/STAT signaling and DNA repair. Intestinal MAFwere potent inducers of CD4 + T helper cell-derived IL-22 and IL-17. Gut-local production of IL-22 promoted barrier function and protected mice from intestinal injury during both antibiotic treatment and bacterial infection. Consistent with the recent findings suggesting the existence of crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the brain ( Buffington et al., 2016 13. Buffington, S.A. ∙ Di Prisco, G.V. ∙ Auchtung, T.A. ...

Neuro-immune interactions at barrier surfaces Cell. 2016; 165 :801-811 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), intestinal colonization with MAF increased the responsiveness of mice to social stimuli, highlighting the ability of gut fungi to modulate host behavior. We found that mucosal fungi induced a systemic release of IL-17A and that the IL-17 sensing in neurons was necessary for the fungal modulation of mouse social behavior. Altogether, our findings suggest that MAF have the unique ability to drive protective mucosal immunity with effects on intestinal epithelial cells, gut barrier function, intestinal disease, and neuroimmune-mediated host behavior.

Specific bacterial communities are associated with different GI sites with strong compositional differences along the length of the digestive tract ( Hsiao et al., 2013 44.

The gut microbiome: Connecting spatial organization to function Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 21 :433-442 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fecal composition cannot fully grasp the complexity of the intestinal microbiota because feces solely provide a “representative picture” of the mycobiota throughout the entire GI tract. To explore the biogeography of the fungal microbiota along the GI tract, we collected LUM and mucosal samples from several GI regions, including the stomach, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon of C57BL/6 mice, and performed ITS sequencing of fungal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) ( Figure 1 A). Nonmetric dimensional scaling of fungal communities revealed a robust clustering based on the LUM versus mucosal sampling site rather than on the longitudinal location ( Figure 1 B). Further analysis revealed a high diversity of LUM mycobiota irrespective of the longitudinal sampling location; however, mucosa-associated fungal communities were significantly less diverse ( Figure 1 C). Because large intestine harbored the highest fungal loads ( Iliev et al., 2012 45. Iliev, I.D. ∙ Funari, V.A. ∙ Taylor, K.D. ... Interactions between commensal fungi and the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 influence colitis Science. 2012; 336 :1314-1317 Crossref Scopus (706) PubMed Google Scholar ), we focused our further analysis on this body site. Differential abundance analysis of samples from the large intestinal mucosa versus LUM content identified several fungal genera that appeared to be preferentially associated with either location ( Figure 1 D). The luminal-associated mycobiota included genera that were likely transient-environmental organisms such as Cladosporium and Aspergillus ( Hallen-Adams and Suhr, 2017 40. Hallen-Adams, H.E. ∙ Suhr, M.J. Fungi in the healthy human gastrointestinal tract Virulence. 2017; 8 :352-358 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the mucosa-enriched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonged to several “immunoreactive” fungal genera ( Bacher et al., 2019 9.

CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as Candida, Saccharomyces, and Saccharomycopsis ( Figure 1 D). A similar mycobiota composition was observed in human subjects where Candida spp. and Saccharomyces spp. were the dominant genera associated with the intestinal mucosa of surgical specimens ( Figures 1 E and 1F; Table S1 ). The presence of distinct communities, together with the reduced alpha diversity observed in the mucosal mycobiota, suggests that only a subset of specialized fungi can colonize the unique environment of the intestinal mucosa.
The close proximity of bacterial strains to the intestinal epithelium has been associated with their ability to induce specific immune responses. To assess whether LUM and MAF have immunoprotective potential, we used a model of antibiotics-induced ecological perturbation coupled with prolonged DSS-mediated injury previously used by others to study how specific microbiota constituents impact barrier function ( Kernbauer et al., 2014 51. Kernbauer, E. ∙ Ding, Y. ∙ Cadwell, K.

Disease tolerance mediated by microbiome E. coli involves inflammasome and IGF-1 signaling Science. 2015; 350 :558-563 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our analysis of LUM and mucosa-associated communities in mice and humans, we generated two defined model consortia consisting of three representative species from each niche: mucosa-associated (MUC) consisting of Candida albicans , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Saccharomycopsis fibuligera , and LUM consisting of Aspergillus amstellodamii , Cladosporium cladosporioides , and Wallemia sebi ( Figure 1 D). To assess whether our model consortia had a distinct effect on the disease progression, we colonized antibiotic-treated mice for three weeks with either LUM or MUC before DSS administration ( Figure 1 G). These experiments revealed that the colonization with the mucosal consortium provided protection against intestinal injury and reduced mortality in mice. By contrast, the colonization with the LUM consortium did not confer protection in this model ( Figures 1 G and 1H).
The intestinal epithelium forms the first cellular barrier between the microbiota and the mucosal immune system in the gut. We thus assessed the effect of the consortium of MAF on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). To minimize noise and confounding effects from the pre-existing intestinal mycobiota, we colonized fungi-free altered Schaedler’s flora (ASF) mice ( Li et al., 2018 59. Li, X. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Semon, A. ...

Med. 1965; 122 :77-82 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the mucosal fungal consortium and performed RNA-seq on colonic epithelial cells (IEC; Figures 2 A, 2B, and S1 A). Intestinal colonization with the MUC consortium induced a distinct transcriptional profile in IECs with the upregulation of genes involved in immune response and cell proliferation ( Figure 2 B). Specifically, the factors involved in oxidative phosphorylation, IFN responses, JAK/STAT signaling, and DNA repair were upregulated, whereas genes involved in TGFβ signaling, protein secretion, and G2M cell-cycle checkpoint were downregulated ( Figure 2 B). Given these data, we further evaluated the intestinal barrier function upon colonization with MUC and LUM consortia. The barrier permeability in SPF mice colonized with either consortium revealed a markedly reduced intestinal permeability upon MUC colonization compared with LUM colonization ( Figure 1 I), consistent with the finding that the latter did not confer protection in our intestinal injury model ( Figure 1 H).
The intestinal epithelium is in constant crosstalk with the immune cells of the underlying intestinal mucosa. Distinct populations of intestinal phagocytes ( Coombes and Powrie, 2008 22.

As fungi can induce strong immune responses, we hypothesized that the protective function of the MUC consortium could be mediated via the immune system. Immunophenotyping of mice colonized with either fungal consortium showed no differences in the composition of the myeloid, ILCs, FoxP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), T-bet + T helper (Th1) cells, and cytotoxic T cells ( Figures 2 C–2F, S1 B, S1C, S2 , and S3 ). By contrast, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of RORγt + Type 17-T helper cells (Th17) in the colonic lamina propria (cLP) and mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) of MUC mice ( Figures 2 F, 2G, 3 B, and S2 A). The Th cells in MUC-colonized mice produced high levels of the effector cytokines IL-22, IL-17A, and IL-17F ( Figures 2 G, 2H, 3 A–3D, S2 B–S2D, and S3 ). The colonization of ASF mice with MUC recapitulated the phenotype observed in antibiotics-treated mice, suggesting that MUC induces Type 17 responses independently from antibiotic-induced dysbiosis ( Figures S4 A–S4C). When assessed individually, two of the members of the MUC consortium— C. albicans and S. cerevisiae —induced an increase in the frequency of colonic Th17 cells. However, the compound effect of the MUC consortium appeared to be stronger ( Figure S3 A and S3B).

We induced intestinal injury in IL-17A ( Il17a −/− )- and IL-22 ( Il22 −/− )-deficient mice in the presence or absence of MUC colonization. As expected, Il17a −/− mice were more susceptible to intestinal injury ( Gaffen et al., 2014 36. Gaffen, S.L. ∙ Jain, R. ∙ Garg, A.V. ...

In these mice, MUC colonization led to a slightly increased survival ( Figures S4 D and S4E). By contrast, the absence of IL-22 abrogated the protective effect of MUC consortia on both survival and barrier function ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) are a major source of IL-22 in the colon ( Ahlfors et al., 2014 2. Ahlfors, H. ∙ Morrison, P.J. ∙ Duarte, J.H. ... IL-22 fate reporter reveals origin and control of IL-22 production in homeostasis and infection J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :4602-4613 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fung et al., 2016 35.

Lymphoid-tissue-resident commensal bacteria promote members of the IL-10 cytokine family to establish mutualism Immunity. 2016; 44 :634-646 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), but their frequency and production of IL-17 and IL-22 were not affected by MUC colonization ( Figures 2 E, 3 E, and S3 D–S3F). After determining that CD4 + T cells are the major source of MUC-induced IL-22, we next assessed whether IL-22-producing CD4 + T cells were sufficient for the protective effect of the MUC consortia. To specifically explore the role of IL-22 production by Th cells, T and B cell-deficient Rag1 −/− mice ( Fung et al., 2016 35. Fung, T.C. ∙ Bessman, N.J. ∙ Hepworth, M.R. ... Lymphoid-tissue-resident commensal bacteria promote members of the IL-10 cytokine family to establish mutualism Immunity. 2016; 44 :634-646 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ) were adoptively transferred with CD4 + T cells derived from either the Il22 +/− (able to produce IL-22) or Il22 −/− mice before the induction of intestinal injury ( Figure 3 H). Notably, the transfer of Il22 +/− CD4 + T cells significantly prolonged the survival of Rag1 −/− mice colonized with the MUC consortium compared with that of the mice adoptively transferred with IL-22-deficient CD4 + T cells ( Figures 3 H–3J), suggesting a key role for T cells as a source of IL-22 in response to MAF colonization.
We next assessed whether the MUC consortium would provide protection during infection with intestinally attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens ( Collins et al., 2014 21. Collins, J.W. ∙ Keeney, K.M. ∙ Crepin, V.F. ... Citrobacter rodentium: Infection, inflammation and the microbiota Nat. Rev.

Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli: Even more subversive elements Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 80 :1420-1438 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). The A/E bacterium Citrobacter rodentium adheres to colonic IEC causing mucosal hyperplasia and wasting disease ( Collins et al., 2014 21. Collins, J.W. ∙ Keeney, K.M. ∙ Crepin, V.F. ... Citrobacter rodentium: Infection, inflammation and the microbiota Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12 :612-623 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with its protective effect on the intestinal epithelium, the colonization with the MUC consortium reduced the severity of C. rodentium infection and pathogen burden in the intestines in antibiotics-treated mice ( Figures 4 A–4G). To determine whether the protective effect was mediated by IL-22, we next infected IL-22-deficient mice in the presence or the absence of MUC. Because Il22 −/− mice are highly susceptible to C. rodentium ( Ahlfors et al., 2014 2. Ahlfors, H. ∙ Morrison, P.J. ∙ Duarte, J.H. ...

Med. 2008; 14 :282-289 Crossref Scopus (1418) PubMed Google Scholar ), inoculation was performed in absence of antibiotic treatment ( Figure 4 H). The MUC consortia did not provide any benefit to Il22 −/− mice but rather aggravated disease severity ( Figures 4 I and 4J) and resulted in an increased C. rodentium colonization ( Figure 4 K). These data suggest that the protective effect of the MUC consortia in infectious colitis is IL-22 associated and not due to direct competition with C. rodentium .

Commensal Candida albicans positively calibrates systemic Th17 immunological responses Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :404-417.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) and examined social and repetitive behaviors in mice colonized with the MUC consortium and age- and sex-matched untreated controls ( Albelda and Joel, 2012 3. Albelda, N. ∙ Joel, D. Animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Exploring pharmacology and neural substrates Neurosci. Biobehav.

Microbiota is essential for social development in the mouse Mol. Psychiatry. 2014; 19 :146-148 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ). MUC colonization did not affect repetitive, anxiety, and compulsion-related behaviors ( Albelda and Joel, 2012 3. Albelda, N. ∙ Joel, D. Animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Exploring pharmacology and neural substrates Neurosci. Biobehav.

Removal of FKBP12 enhances mTOR-raptor interactions, LTP, memory, and perseverative/repetitive behavior Neuron. 2008; 60 :832-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S5 ). When subjected to the three-chamber sociability test, mice colonized with the MUC consortium demonstrated an increased social preference and spent significantly more time in the chamber with a social stimulus and less time in the empty chamber ( Figures 5 A–5E). Further, MUC-colonized mice spent more time interacting with the social stimulus, as indicated by the direct interaction index ( Figure 5 F). These results demonstrate that MAF can promote social behavior but not anxiety-related or repetitive behaviors. We next wondered whether the changes could be driven by a compensatory effect of gut fungi following the antibiotic-mediated depletion of the bacterial communities. Importantly, MUC colonization promoted social behavior in presence of a stable community of bacteria (the ASF bacterial consortium), suggesting that the observed effect can occur in absence of antibiotics-induced bacterial dysbiosis ( Figures 5 G–5J).
Growing evidence suggests that the interaction between the nervous and immune system plays a critical role in the development of social behavior ( Kopec et al., 2018 52. Kopec, A.M. ∙ Smith, C.J. ∙ Ayre, N.R. ... Microglial dopamine receptor elimination defines sex-specific nucleus accumbens development and social behavior in adolescent rats Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3769 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because various cytokines possess a direct neuromodulatory role in the central nervous system and peripheral neural system (CNS and PNS) ( Salvador et al., 2021 79. Salvador, A.F. ∙ de Lima, K.A. ∙ Kipnis, J. Neuromodulation by the immune system: A focus on cytokines Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21 :526-541 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reasoned that the MUC-induced production of IL-22 and or IL-17 observed in both antibiotics-treated and ASF mice could be an important driver of the observed behavioral changes. Despite the increase of Type 17 cytokines induced by MUC in the intestine, only IL-17A was systemically increased in the serum and spleens of MUC-colonized mice ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). Through the analysis of previously published single-cell RNA-seq data ( Zeisel et al., 2018 102. Zeisel, A. ∙ Hochgerner, H. ∙ Lönnerberg, P. ... Molecular architecture of the mouse nervous system Cell. 2018; 174 :999-1014.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (971) PubMed Google Scholar ), we confirmed that both enteric and CNS neurons express high levels of the IL-17 receptor gene Il17ra but not the IL-22 receptor genes Il22ra1 and Il22ra2 ( Figure 6 B; Table S3 ). As expected, Il22 deletion did not affect the ability of the MUC consortium to increase social behavior ( Figures 6 C–6E).
IL-17A has been shown to possess direct neuromodulatory properties and influence social behavior in mice ( Alves de Lima et al., 2020 5. Alves de Lima, K. ∙ Rustenhoven, J. ∙ Da Mesquita, S. ...

To assess whether the direct sensing of IL-17A by neurons contributes to the observed behavioral phenotype, we crossed pan-neuronal BAF53b-Cre mice ( Morarach et al., 2021 66. Morarach, K. ∙ Mikhailova, A. ∙ Knoflach, V. ... Diversification of molecularly defined myenteric neuron classes revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing Nat.

Generation of BAF53b-Cre transgenic mice with pan-neuronal Cre activities Genesis. 2015; 53 :440-448 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Il17ra fl/fl mice to specifically abrogate IL-17 signaling in neurons ( Baf53b ΔIl17ra ). Following antibiotics-induced dysbiosis, MUC-colonized Baf53b ΔIl17ra mice had no overt differences in terms of distance traveled, mobility, and anxiety-related behavior compared with nontreated Baf53b ΔIl17ra controls ( Figures S6 C and S6D). As expected, MUC colonization promoted social behavior in the IL-17R competent cre − / − littermates (Litt, Figures 6 F–6H). By contrast, the social behavior of Baf53b ΔIl17ra did not improve upon MUC colonization and was significantly reduced compared with MUC-colonized cre- littermates ( Figures 6 F–6H). Further, MUC colonization did not increase the direct interaction with the age- and sex-matched test mice in Baf53b ΔIl17ra mice ( Figures S6 E and S6F). Collectively, our results suggest that the fungal colonization of the intestinal mucosa promotes social behavior in mice through a direct action of IL-17A on neurons.

However, far less attention has been focused on the role of gut-native fungal communities in homeostasis despite data suggesting that fungi are important players in the diversification of the host immune repertoire and a key component for a balanced intestinal ecosystem ( Wheeler et al., 2017 96. Wheeler, M.L. ∙ Limon, J.J. ∙ Underhill, D.M. Immunity to commensal fungi: Detente and disease Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2017; 12 :359-385 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Akin to bacteria, the outcomes of fungal colonization with select fungi are likely to depend not only on the characteristic of the colonizing species but also on their site-specific ability to interact with the host ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ...

Interactions between the microbiota and the immune system Science. 2012; 336 :1268-1273 Crossref Scopus (2601) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using next-generation sequencing of the fungal rDNA ITS region, we characterized the biogeography of the intestinal mycobiota and revealed a site-specific clustering of the gut fungal communities. We identified a subset of fungal genera that are closely associated with the intestinal mucosa. In both humans and mice, these MAF include genera such as Candida and Saccharomyces , which have been previously shown to modulate host immunity ( Bacher et al., 2019 9. Bacher, P. ∙ Hohnstein, T. ∙ Beerbaum, E. ...

CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, many of the lumen-associated genera that we identified are unlikely to represent true colonizers and might rather be transient-environmental fungi lacking the ability to adhere to the mucosa or interact with the intestinal epithelium ( Hallen-Adams and Suhr, 2017 40. Hallen-Adams, H.E. ∙ Suhr, M.J. Fungi in the healthy human gastrointestinal tract Virulence. 2017; 8 :352-358 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ).
By establishing a defined consortium of fungi that can colonize the intestinal mucosa and comparing their immunomodulatory properties to a consortium of LUM fungi, we unearthed compelling evidence that these MAF promoted barrier function and protected mice from intestinal injury upon antibiotic treatment and during bacterial infection. In particular, we found that MAF drove a distinct immunological response that reduced intestinal permeability and increased mouse social behavior.
Th cells have been shown to play distinct roles during fungal infection and colonization ( Speakman et al., 2020 87. Speakman, E.A. ∙ Dambuza, I.M. ∙ Salazar, F. ...

We revealed that the potent induction of IL-22 and IL-17A production in CD4 + T cells differentially mediates the effect of intestinal mucosal fungi on the mammalian host.
Complex gene-environment interactions contribute to the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). While gut bacteria have been implicated in the development of neurological disorders and are known to influence mouse behavior ( Chu et al., 2019 19. Chu, C. ∙ Murdock, M.H. ∙ Jing, D. ... The microbiota regulate neuronal function and fear extinction learning Nature. 2019; 574 :543-548 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Desbonnet et al., 2014 25. Desbonnet, L. ∙ Clarke, G. ∙ Shanahan, F. ... Microbiota is essential for social development in the mouse Mol. Psychiatry. 2014; 19 :146-148 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ), key questions about the involvement of the mycobiota are just beginning to be investigated. We showed that MAF promote murine social behavior both in the presence and absence of bacterial communities, suggesting a direct effect of fungi along the gut-brain axis. Although previous work by multiple investigators and our study demonstrate that intestinal microbes can modulate host behavior in mice, the functional role of the gut microbiota in the etiology of ASD and other neurological manifestations remains controversial ( Yap et al., 2021 100. Yap, C.X. ∙ Henders, A.K. ∙ Alvares, G.A. ... Autism-related dietary preferences mediate autism-gut microbiome associations Cell. 2021; 184 :5916-5931.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Greater insight into the mechanism of microbial-mediated behavioral modulation might help shed light onto their role in the development of this and other conditions. Cytokine aberrations are common in ASD ( Zhao et al., 2021 104. Zhao, H. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Liu, S. ... Association of peripheral blood levels of cytokines With autism spectrum disorder: A meta-analysis Front. Psychiatry. 2021; 12 :670200 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) and might play role in modulating neural function. Cytokines have been shown to regulate the neuro-immune crosstalk via receptors expressed in both neural and immune cells ( Veiga-Fernandes and Mucida, 2016 94. Veiga-Fernandes, H. ∙ Mucida, D.

IL-17a promotes sociability in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders Nature. 2020; 577 :249-253 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we show that MAF induce unique local and systemic cytokine signatures. In particular, mucosal fungi increase the levels of IL-17A both enterically and in the systemic circulation. IL-17A possesses direct neuromodulatory properties ( Alves de Lima et al., 2020 5. Alves de Lima, K. ∙ Rustenhoven, J. ∙ Da Mesquita, S. ...

In mice, IL-17A has been shown to act on neurons of the somatosensory cortex and promote social behavior ( Reed et al., 2020 77. Reed, M.D. ∙ Yim, Y.S. ∙ Wimmer, R.D. ... IL-17a promotes sociability in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders Nature. 2020; 577 :249-253 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). By specifically abrogating IL-17RA on neurons, we have shown that IL-17 signaling is an important mediator of the effect of fungi along the gut-brain axis. Our work suggests that the direct neuromodulation by fungi-induced IL-17A mediates an increase in social behavior in mice.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that the spatial organization of the mycobiota within the intestinal niche is a key factor in driving protective mucosal immunity. This interaction has a profound local and systemic impact on the intestinal epithelium, neurons, barrier function, intestinal disease, and host behavior.
Although our study demonstrates that MAF can modulate both the host susceptibility to intestinal disease and its behavior, there are a few outstanding issues: • Recent studies have highlighted strong strain-specific differences in the immune-modulatory properties of gut fungi (X.V.L., I.L., and I.D.I., unpublished data). The experiments described in this study were performed with a limited number of fungal strains and can thus not be generalized to every member of each species. Further studies are needed to elucidate the functional effects of individual strains. • Neural circuits are subject to sensitive temporal windows of increased plasticity ( Lupien et al., 2009 63. Lupien, S.J. ∙ McEwen, B.S. ∙ Gunnar, M.R. ... Effects of stress throughout the lifespan on the brain, behaviour and cognition Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10 :434-445 Crossref Scopus (3747) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our behavioral experiments, mice were colonized with fungi immediately after weaning (3 weeks of age). Our study did not identify the critical temporal window for the effect of fungi on mouse behavior. • Our study suggests that IL-17RA on neurons is essential to mediate the effects of fungi along the gut-brain axis. However, we did not thoroughly delineate which neuron populations are involved. • Our work demonstrates that MAF can promote social behavior in mice. Whether this phenomenon can be translated to humans with the existence of a complex commensal microbial community remains to be determined.

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
C57BL/6J (Stock #: 000664), Rag1 -/- (B6.129S7- Rag1 tm1Mom /J, Jackson Stock# 002216), and Il17a -/- (Il17atm1.1(icre)Stck/J, #016879) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at WCMC for at least 3 generations. IL-22 reporter mice (C57BL/6-Tg (Il22-EGFP)1Gson/J, Jackson Stock# 035005) were generated in the laboratory of Dr. Sonnenberg ( Teng et al., 2019 92. Teng, F. ∙ Goc, J. ∙ Zhou, L. ... A circadian clock is essential for homeostasis of group 3 innate lymphoid cells in the gut Sci. Immunol. 2019; 4 :eaax1215 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). C57BL/6- Il22 tm1.1 (icre)Stck /J (Jackson Stock# 027524) x R26R-EYFP (Jackson Stock# 006148), the specific cross was annotated as Il22 cre/ + YFP mice allowing for tracking of Il22 expression and was provided by Dr. Gregory Sonnenberg. The Il22 cre/ cre YFP mice lack Il22 expression and are annotated throughout the study as Il22 -/- . BAF53b-Cre mice (Tg (Actl6b-Cre)4092Jiwu/J, #027826) and Il17ra fl/fl mice (B6.Cg- Il17ra tm2.1Koll /J, # 031000) were bred to obtain F1: Actl6b cre+/- Il17ra fl/+ mice. F1 was bred with Il17ra fl/fl mice. Actl6b cre+/- ( BAF53b ΔIL17ra ) or Actl6 cre -/- littermates (Litt) were used as control and co-house with cre+ mice (separated by sex) for the whole length of the experiment. For chemically induced and infectious colitis, littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Animals were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age unless otherwise specified. Males and females were used in approximately equal ratios or as noted in figure legend. All animals were housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions unless otherwise described at Weill Cornell Medicine. Experiments were performed after prior approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Cornell Medicine.
Human colonic mucosa of deidentified individuals according to the Institutional Review Board approved protocol from the Weill Cornell Medicine in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Luminal contents were removed by gentle washing with saline and mucosal associated tissues was collected by gentle scraping with a disposable sterile inoculation loop. Samples were snap frozen upon collection and stored at -80C. Upon collection of all specimens, samples were processed for ITS sequencing as described below.
Fungal cultures are started from stocks in 30% glycerol in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB; EMD Chemicals). Candida albicans (SC5314) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen (ATCC MYA-796™) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Saccharomycopsis fibuligera (Ili7) was previously isolated from the mouse gut ( Iliev et al., 2012 45. Iliev, I.D. ∙ Funari, V.A. ∙ Taylor, K.D. ... Interactions between commensal fungi and the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 influence colitis Science. 2012; 336 :1314-1317 Crossref Scopus (706) PubMed Google Scholar ). hMUC C. albicans and S. cerevisiae were previously isolated from a mucosal wash. C. albicans , S. cerevisiae and S. fibuligera were cultured overnight in aerobic conditions on SBD agar plates at 37 ° C. For mice inoculations, cultures were started from single colonies (agar-plates) in liquid SDB at 37 ° C. For mice inoculation, fungi were centrifuged 10 min at 500 rcf, washed once with sterile PBS and counted. Aspergillus amstelodami (ATCC 46362) was cultured on SDB at 30 ° C. Wallemia sebi (FRR 1471, ATCC 42964) and Cladosporium cladosporioides (ATCC 38810) were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar ( SDA ; EMD Chemicals) at room temperature (20-22 o C). For collection of W. sebi and C. cladosporioides plates were flooded with 7 ml 0.05% Tween 80 (in H 2 O) and carefully scraped with sterile inoculation loop. Liquid was filtered through a 40μm cell strainer, centrifuged 5 min at 450 rcf, washed once in sterile PBS and counted for mice inoculation.
Age matched groups of mice were randomly allocated to the experimental groups. To ensure reproducibility, each experiment was performed independently at least twice.
Cefoperazone (0.4 g/l; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was provided to mice ad libitum in drinking water for the whole length of the experiments. 3 days after starting the cefoperazone treatment, mice were fed with fungal consortia every 4 days. Mice were sacrificed at day 14 and sampled as described below. To assess colonization fecal pellets were collected 3 days after the first fungal gavage. For the assessment of intestinal mucosa colonization, after mouse euthanasia, intestines were removed at day 10 post colonization (or in one set of experiments at day 3 and day 7), rinsed thoroughly with ice cold PBS until removal of all luminal contents. The mucosa was then collected by gentle scraping with a disposable, sterile inoculation loop. Feces or mucosal scrapings were weighted and plated as serial dilutions in PBS on SD agar. Fungal load is quantified as colony forming units (cfu) per gram of feces or assessed by qPCR upon DNA isolated as described below.
Mice were orally supplemented with the mucosal fungal consortium every 3 days for 10 days prior to the DSS treatment. Control groups were orally gavaged with PBS at the same time points. Body weight and the presence of occult blood were assessed daily. Mice were administered with sterile 3% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in an antibiotic cocktail (ABX: ampicillin 0.4g/l, vancomycin 0.4g/l, metronidazole 0.3g/l, cefoperazone 0.4g/l, 10% sucrose) for 5 days followed by a recovery period of 7 days with ABX. At day 12 mice were administered DSS+ABX \until achievement of end point. For the adaptive transfer of CD4 + T cells in Rag1 -/- mice spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes of Il22 -/- or Il22 +/- donor mice were removed by dissection. Tissues were mashed into a nylon screen, and the cells obtained were pooled, washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Sigma-Aldrich), and resuspended at 10 8 cells/ml. CD4 + T cells were isolated by negative selection, using MagniSort™ Mouse CD4 + T cell Enrichment Kit (eBioscience), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated CD4 + T cells were transferred into recipient Rag1 -/- mice by retro-orbital injection 1 day prior to the administration of DSS.
C. rodentium was grown on a Luria-Bertani (LB) plate 2 days before infection. A liquid culture from a single colony was started in LB and incubated overnight (37°C at 200 rpm) and then re-grown on 50ml of LB for 3-4 hours until growth to 0.6 at OD600. Mice were orally inoculated with 10 9 bacteria per mouse (in 100 μl PBS). Body weights was assessed daily. Feces were collected, weighted, and plated in serial dilutions on MacConkey agar No 1 (Sigma) for C. rodentium quantification.
Altered Schaedler flora (ASF) mice were generated from germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice inoculated with ASF and bred for at least 5 generations to obtain fully immunocompetent progeny. ASF mice were maintained within sterile vinyl isolators at Weill Cornell Medical College Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility. For the generation of gnotobiotic mice colonized with the fungal mucosal consortium, ASF mice were colonized at 5 weeks of age and housed in isolated cages.
Intestinal lamina propria (LP) cells were isolated as previously described ( Leonardi et al., 2018 56. Leonardi, I. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Semon, A. ... CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. Briefly, colons and ceca were isolated, opened longitudinally, washed of fecal contents, and then cut into 1 cm pieces. Intestinal pieces were transferred into HBSS medium (Sigma), supplemented with 2 mM EDTA, and were shaken for 8 min at 37°C. The remaining tissue was washed, cut in small pieces, and subsequently incubated in digestion medium consisting of RPMI 1640, 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mg/ml collagenase type VIII (Sigma), 5 U/ml DNase (Roche Diagnostics), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 25 min at 37°C by gentle shaking. The cell suspensions were washed with PBS, filtered through a mesh, and used directly for immune-phenotyping of LP cells.
Cell suspensions were prepared as described above, blocked with CD16/CD32 (Mouse BD Fc Block™, 2.4G2, BD Biosciences) and stained with Fixable Viability Dye (eFluor® 506, eBioscience, 1:1000 concentration) and with surface antibodies at a 1:250 concentration in PBS 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumine (antibodies are listed in the Key Resource Table). For intracellular staining of transcription factors, cells were stained with surface markers, fixed permeabilized over night at 4°C with eBioscience™ Fixation/Permeabilization buffer. Cells were stained with anti-TF antibodies at a 1:200 concentration in eBioscience™ Permeabilization buffer. For intracellular cytokine detection, cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich), 500 ng/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 μg/ml Brefeldin A (BFA; Sigma-Aldrich) in complete RPMI media at 37° C for 6 h. After surface staining cells were fixed, permeabilized overnight at 4 °C with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™ buffer. Staining was performed using the relevant anti-cytokine antibodies for 1h 4 °C at a 1:100 concentration in BD Perm/Wash™ Buffer. Flow cytometry was performed using a LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). See Figure S2 for gating procedure.
Age and sex matched C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed at WCMC in temperature-controlled rooms with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Mice were tested during the light phase of the light cycle under dim light conditions (18-20 LUX); to control for time-of-day effects, cages of different groups were alternated. To minimize animal stress, cages were changed weekly by the investigator performing the behavioral testing; care was taken not to test animals within three days of cage changes. To further minimize confounding results due to stress, mice were handled for three consecutive days prior to the start of testing. Mice were permitted a minimum 60-minute habituation period to the testing room, and testing was performed at the same time of day. All comparisons were made between littermates. Behaviors were tested in the following order: social behavior, marble burying, elevated plus maze.
During a ten-minute habituation period, a test mouse was placed in the center chamber and given free access to the entire arena ( Figure 5 A). A clean pair of gloves was used to handle each mouse. The two lateral chambers contained an inverted empty metal cylinder. Immediately following the habituation phase, an unfamiliar, age and sex-matched C57BL/6J mouse was placed in one of the two cylinders for a total of 10 additional min. Between subjects, the placement of the social stimulus mouse was successively alternated between the two lateral chambers ( Moy et al., 2004 67. Moy, S.S. ∙ Nadler, J.J. ∙ Perez, A. ... Sociability and preference for social novelty in five inbred strains: an approach to assess autistic-like behavior in mice Genes Brain Behav. 2004; 3 :287-302 Crossref Scopus (930) PubMed Google Scholar ). The entire arena setting was cleaned with water and Clidox-S (Pharmacal, Naugatuck, CT) after each trial. EthoVision software (EthoVision, Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands) was linked via an overhead camera and tracked the movement of each subject in every compartment. The distance traveled (cm) and the duration of stay (s) in each compartment were measured automatically by EthoVision. Nose, center, and tail points were tracked. The direct interaction index for the social phase was calculated based on the time spent in the social (S) and non-social chamber (NS) as (S-NS)/ (S+NS).
The elevated plus maze consisted of two opposite open arms (25 × 5 cm, with 3-mm-high ledges) and two perpendicular closed arms (25 × 5 cm, with 15-cm-high walls) of the same size. The maze was made of opaque plastic plates and was elevated to a height of 50 cm. Each mouse was placed in the central square of the maze (5 × 5 cm), facing one of the open arms, and was recorded for 10 min. The distance traveled (cm) and the duration of stay (s) in each compartment were measured automatically by EthoVision.
Mice were placed in a cage bottom with floor area of 483 cm 2 filled with 4 cm of fresh, autoclaved wood chip bedding. Each cage contained 20 homogenously distributed glass marbles (4 × 5) on top of the bedding. Mice were returned to their cage after 10 min. The number of buried marbles (50% or more covered) was recorded. Bedding and cage were replaced for each mouse, marbles were washed with Clidox-S (Pharmacal, Naugatuck, CT), rinsed with water and dried between tests.
Mouse intestinal content or mucosal scrapings were collected. DNA for fungal sequencing and validation RT-qPCR was isolated from mouse intestinal content or mucosal scrapings, or from human colonic mucosa of deidentified individuals according to the Institutional Review Board approved protocol from the Weill Cornell Medicine, following lyticase treatment, bead beating with 0.1mm and 0.5 mm beads, and processing using QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) as in ( Tang et al., 2015 91.

Fungal ITS1-2 regions were amplified by PCR for analysis of mouse and human fungal microbiomes that were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platforms. The following PCR primers: ITS1F CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA; ITS2R GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC, were modified to include forward (5’ TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-[locus-specific sequence]) and reverse (5’ GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-[locus-specific sequence]) sequencing adaptors. ITS amplicons were generated with 35 cycles, using Invitrogen AccuPrime PCR reagents (Carlsbad, CA). Amplicons were then used in the second PCR reaction, using Illumina Nextera XT v2 (San Diego, CA) barcoded primers to uniquely index each sample and 2x300 paired end sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, CA). DNA was amplified using the following PCR protocol: Initial denaturation at 94 ° C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 ° C for 30 s, annealing at 55 ° C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 ° C for 2 min, followed by an elongation step at 72 ° C for 30 min. All libraries were subjected to quality control using qPCR, DNA 1000 Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and Qubit (Life Technologies) to validate and quantitate library construction prior to preparing a Paired End flow cell. The sequencing data are deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra , SUB6653651).
Raw FASTQ ITS1 sequencing data were filtered to enrich for high quality reads, removing the adapter sequence by cutadapt v1.4.1 or any reads that do not contain the proximal primer sequence ( Tang et al., 2015 91. Tang, J. ∙ Iliev, I.D. ∙ Brown, J. ... Mycobiome: Approaches to analysis of intestinal fungi J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 421 :112-121 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequence reads were then quality-trimmed by truncating reads not having an average quality score of 20 (Q20) over a 3 base pair sliding window and removing reads shorter than 100 bp (57). These high quality reads were then aligned to Targeted Host Fungi (THF) ITS1 database, using BLAST v2.2.22 and the pick_otus.py pipeline in the QIIME v1.6 wrapper with an identity percentage ≥97% for operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking ( Altschul et al., 1990 4. Altschul, S.F. ∙ Gish, W. ∙ Miller, W. ... Basic local alignment search tool J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215 :403-410 Crossref Scopus (69041) PubMed Google Scholar ). The alignment results were then tabulated across all reads, using the accession identifier of the ITS reference sequences as surrogate OTUs and using a Perl script ( Tang et al., 2015 91. Tang, J. ∙ Iliev, I.D. ∙ Brown, J. ... Mycobiome: Approaches to analysis of intestinal fungi J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 421 :112-121 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). For Illumina bacterial analysis, because of the abundance of Illumina reads and higher overall sequence quality of the reads, we used the QIIME package with minimal customization ( Edgar, 2010 31. Edgar, R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2460-2461 Crossref Scopus (13480) PubMed Google Scholar ). Shannon diversity index (H) was calculated at the OTUs levels as (1) 𝐻 𝐼 = − ∑ 𝑆 𝑖 = 1 𝑝 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑙 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑝 𝑖 ) (Equation 1) where p i is the proportional abundance of OTUs i .
Simpson Diversity Index (1-D) (60) was calculated as (2) 1 − 𝐷 = 1 − ∑ 𝑅 𝑖 = 1 𝑛 𝑖 ⁢ ( 𝑛 𝑖 − 1 ) 𝑁 ⁢ ( 𝑁 − 1 ) (Equation 2) Where N= total number of individuals of all species, n i = total number of individuals for each species i .
For RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), ASF mice were colonized with the mucosal consortium by oral gavage. A single litter of 9-week-old animals was used for the experiment. Two weeks after gavage of the mucosal consortium, mice were sacrificed, and the colons were removed and opened longitudinally. The colons were rinsed thoroughly with ice cold PBS until removal of all luminal contents. Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were collected by gentle scraping with a disposable, sterile inoculation loop. IEC were collected in Trizol and lysed by repeated passing through a 27G syringe needle. RNA was extracted by chloroform phase separation followed by RNA extraction with in-column DNase treatment using the Direct-zol RNA Kit (Zymo Research). Agilent Bioanalyzer Sample QC – Nanogel was used to determine the Total RNA concentration and quality ( Table S2 ).
Poly-A pull-down was performed to enrich mRNAs from total RNA samples, followed by library construction using Illumina TruSeq chemistry. Cluster generation and 50–base pair single-end 50 cycled sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq4000 system. Raw sequence reads were mapped to the mouse genome mm10/GRCm38 using the STAR aligner ( Dobin et al., 2013 27. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: Ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (17570) PubMed Google Scholar ) version 2.5.2b. Mapped reads were counted at the gene level using the Rsubread R package ( Liao et al., 2019 60. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. The R package Rsubread is easier, faster, cheaper and better for alignment and quantification of RNA sequencing reads Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :e47 Crossref Scopus (658) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lowly expressed genes were prefiltered, keeping only genes with 50 or more raw counts in at least 2 samples. Library size normalization and further analysis was performed using the R package DESeq2 version 1.22.2 ( Love et al., 2014 62. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (29293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed based on the 500 genes with highest variance after applying the DESeq2 variance stabilizing transformation. Differential expression was assessed using the Wald test as implemented in DESeq2, with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) threshold of 0.1 being used as a significance threshold. Gene set enrichment analysis vas performed using the R package fgsea version 1.8.0 ( Korotkevich et al., 2021 53. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Budin, N. ... Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2021; 060012 Crossref Google Scholar ) and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) H hallmark gene sets for mouse ( http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB ).
Statistical analysis was calculated by GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) and R. Statistical details of experiments can be found in the figures’ legend. Unless otherwise indicated individual dots represent each individual mouse and data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Significance is defined as: ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗ p < 0.001. Mann-Whitney Test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to data comparison as specified in the figures’ legend.
