Title: Endocytosis Inhibition in Humans to Improve Responses to ADCC-Mediating Antibodies


Abstract: Summary

A safe and controlled manipulation of endocytosis in vivo may have disruptive therapeutic potential. Here, we demonstrate that the anti-emetic/anti-psychotic prochlorperazine can be repurposed to reversibly inhibit the in vivo endocytosis of membrane proteins targeted by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, as directly demonstrated by our human tumor ex vivo assay. Temporary endocytosis inhibition results in enhanced target availability and improved efficiency of natural killer cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a mediator of clinical responses induced by IgG1 antibodies, demonstrated here for cetuximab, trastuzumab, and avelumab. Extensive analysis of downstream signaling pathways ruled out on-target toxicities. By overcoming the heterogeneity of drug target availability that frequently characterizes poorly responsive or resistant tumors, clinical application of reversible endocytosis inhibition may considerably improve the clinical benefit of ADCC-mediating therapeutic antibodies.

Section: Introduction

Temporary inhibition of endocytosis via molecules such as prochlorperazine (PCZ) has been proposed for numerous clinical applications including viral infection ( Carro et al., 2018; Hernaez and Alonso, 2010; Ho et al., 2017; Simanjuntak et al., 2015 10.

Biol. 2013; 5 :a016949 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). This concept has not been translated to clinic. We validated a reliable assay to measure endocytosis in human tumors and demonstrated that live ex vivo explants of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive human tumors can be classified into those where EGF was, or was not, able to be endocytosed. Patients in whom tumor EGFR escapes endocytosis responded better to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy ( Joseph et al., 2019; Mellman and Yarden, 2013 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest.

Biol. 2013; 5 :a016949 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). EGFR endocytosis in vivo in murine models is dynamin-dependent ( Pinilla-Macua et al., 2017 68. Pinilla-Macua, I. ∙ Grassart, A. ∙ Duvvuri, U. ... EGF receptor signaling, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and endocytosis in tumors in vivo eLife. 2017; 6 :e31993 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). We postulated that temporary endocytosis inhibition may increase target receptor availability for antibody binding, thereby increasing the efficacy of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via receptor clustering and retention at the cell surface, leading to improved clinical responses.
The anti-tumor actions of anti-EGFR mAbs involve multiple mechanisms, including those dependent on the immune system, such as ADCC, and this is a mechanism for clinical response ( Hara et al., 2008; Kawaguchi et al., 2007; Kimura et al., 2007; Kurai et al., 2007; Naramura et al., 1993; Pahl et al., 2012 28.

Inhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytotoxicity against tumor targets Nat. Med. 2000; 6 :443-446 Crossref Scopus (2425) PubMed Google Scholar ), playing a major role in its therapeutic ability and as an important driver of tumor clearance in vivo ( Clynes et al., 2000; Moretta et al., 2001 15.

Immunol. 2001; 19 :197-223 Crossref Scopus (1534) PubMed Google Scholar ). The humanized fragment, crystallizable region (Fc) region of therapeutic mAbs bound to their target on cancer cells can bind Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on NK cells, triggering ADCC ( Muntasell et al., 2017 57. Muntasell, A. ∙ Cabo, M. ∙ Servitja, S. ... Interplay between Natural Killer Cells and Anti-HER2 Antibodies: Perspectives for Breast Cancer Immunotherapy Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1544 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trastuzumab activity is severely attenuated in FcγR-deficient mice ( Clynes et al., 2000 15. Clynes, R.A. ∙ Towers, T.L. ∙ Presta, L.G. ... Inhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytotoxicity against tumor targets Nat. Med. 2000; 6 :443-446 Crossref Scopus (2425) PubMed Google Scholar ), and trastuzumab F(ab′) 2 fragments show little anti-tumor activity ( Spiridon et al., 2004 86. Spiridon, C.I. ∙ Guinn, S. ∙ Vitetta, E.S. A comparison of the in vitro and in vivo activities of IgG and F(ab’)2 fragments of a mixture of three monoclonal anti-Her-2 antibodies Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10 :3542-3551 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trastuzumab administration increases tumor infiltration of immune effector cells ( Gennari et al., 2004 25. Gennari, R. ∙ Menard, S. ∙ Fagnoni, F. ... Pilot study of the mechanism of action of preoperative trastuzumab in patients with primary operable breast tumors overexpressing HER2 Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10 :5650-5655 Crossref Scopus (441) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following engagement with antibody-coated target, NK cells rapidly release granzymes and perforin, resulting in tumor cell destruction ( Alderson and Sondel, 2011; Wang et al., 2015 1. Alderson, K.L. ∙ Sondel, P.M. Clinical cancer therapy by NK cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity J. Biomed.

Evidence suggests ADCC plays a crucial role in the response to clinical mAb-based therapy ( Alderson and Sondel, 2011; Clynes et al., 2000; Imai and Takaoka, 2006; Kohrt et al., 2019; Roghanian et al., 2015; Seidel et al., 2013; Sondel and Hank, 2001; Wang et al., 2015 1.

Anti-tumor responses to cetuximab (anti-EGFR IgG1 antibody) via ADCC are dependent on EGFR expression on the tumor cells and the binding affinity of cetuximab to EGFR ( Kimura et al., 2007; Seo et al., 2014 42. Kimura, H. ∙ Sakai, K. ∙ Arao, T. ...

Rep. 2014; 31 :2115-2122 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). A single point mutation in the FcγR receptor defines patient response as either IgG2 or IgG1 responders ( Bardelli and Jänne, 2012; Trivedi et al., 2016 5. Bardelli, A. ∙ Jänne, P.A.

Cancer Res. 2016; 22 :5229-5237 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). For ADCC to occur, the antigen-mAb complex should remain on the cell surface long enough to maximize interaction between the mAb Fc region and immune effector cells ( Scott et al., 2012 77. Scott, A.M. ∙ Wolchok, J.D. ∙ Old, L.J. Antibody therapy of cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 :278-287 Crossref Scopus (1747) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sensitivity to rituximab is affected by internalization of the CD20-rituximab complexes ( Roghanian et al., 2015 72. Roghanian, A. ∙ Teige, I. ∙ Mårtensson, L. ... Antagonistic human FcγRIIB (CD32B) antibodies have anti-tumor activity and overcome resistance to antibody therapy in vivo Cancer Cell. 2015; 27 :473-488 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ), highlighting the importance of prolonging surface target exposure to amplify the mAbs’ effect on ADCC activity.
Avelumab (IgG1) binds to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), inhibiting PD1-PD-L1 interaction, blocking checkpoint inhibition, and restoring T cell function and anti-tumor activity. Anti-PD-L1 mAb efficacy against PD-L1-negative tumors occurs via NK cells expressing PD-L1 as cytolytic effectors ( Dong et al., 2019 20. Dong, W. ∙ Wu, X. ∙ Ma, S. ... The Mechanism of Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Efficacy against PD-L1-Negative Tumors Identifies NK Cells Expressing PD-L1 as a Cytolytic Effector Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1422-1437 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). Avelumab also exhibits anti-tumor activity by stimulating ADCC and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis ( Imai and Takaoka, 2006 34. Imai, K. ∙ Takaoka, A. Comparing antibody and small-molecule therapies for cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6 :714-727 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ). Avelumab has a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumors ( Kelly et al., 2018 40. Kelly, K. ∙ Infante, J.R. ∙ Taylor, M.H. ... Safety profile of avelumab in patients with advanced solid tumors: A pooled analysis of data from the phase 1 JAVELIN solid tumor and phase 2 JAVELIN Merkel 200 clinical trials Cancer. 2018; 124 :2010-2017 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Merkel cell carcinoma ( Kaufman et al., 2018 38. Kaufman, H.L. ∙ Russell, J.S. ∙ Hamid, O. ... Updated efficacy of avelumab in patients with previously treated metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma after ≥1 year of follow-up: JAVELIN Merkel 200, a phase 2 clinical trial J. Immunother. Cancer. 2018; 6 :7 Crossref Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in FDA Review and Evaluation for Biologics License Application 761049 ( Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 2016 11. Center for Drug Evaluation and Research BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation: BLA 761049 Bavencio (Avelumab). reference no. 4073902 2016 Google Scholar ), the ADCC response to avelumab is decreased compared to that mediated by cetuximab, yet both have identical IgG1 chains. EGFR (cetuximab target) and HER2 (trastuzumab target) cluster on the plasma membrane via homo- and heterodimerization and the formation of protein rafts ( Iqbal and Iqbal, 2014; Wee and Wang, 2017 35. Iqbal, N. ∙ Iqbal, N. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) in Cancers: Overexpression and Therapeutic Implications Mol. Biol. Int. 2014; 2014 :852748 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 94. Wee, P. ∙ Wang, Z. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Cell Proliferation Signaling Pathways Cancers (Basel). 2017; 9 :52 Crossref Scopus (1184) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that the observed reduced avelumab-mediated ADCC may be due to reduced plasma membrane clustering or retention of PD-L1 compared to the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).
We evaluated the effects of dynamin inhibition, using small molecule inhibitors and dynamin K44A dominant-negative mutant, on cetuximab, trastuzumab, and avelumab-mediated ADCC and the impact endocytosis inhibition has on the immune system and on tumor growth in three murine cancer models. The effects on ADCC mediated by lumretuzumab (anti-ErbB3 IgG1) or dalotuzumab (anti-IGF1R IgG1), antibodies to targets whose internalization is not dynamin mediated, were also examined as negative isotype controls. The clinically available drug PCZ was used as an endocytosis inhibitor in combination with therapeutic antibodies in murine models of cancer. Through a pilot clinical study, we demonstrate that PCZ alters EGFR distribution in vivo in humans, replicating the “responder” pattern previously identified ( Joseph et al., 2019 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, this work demonstrates the potential for PCZ to be used as a non-selective dynamic and reversible inhibitor in clinic.

Section: Results

Analysis of patient-derived squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines indicate that ligand-induced EGFR trafficking alters when tumor cells are cultured and that these cells have extensive and heterogeneous signaling pathway alterations. However, our ex vivo analysis of live tumor sections demonstrated a positive 100% correlation between EGFR that had escaped endocytosis and clinical response to mAb therapy ( Joseph et al., 2019 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). In head and neck SCC, small molecule inhibitors of EGFR signaling (erlotinib) are not used due to low clinical efficacy, while anti-EGFR IgG1 antibody cetuximab is used clinically. We tested the effect of a reversible small molecular weight inhibitor of dynamin, Dyngo4a ( Harper et al., 2013 29. Harper, C.B. ∙ Popoff, M.R. ∙ McCluskey, A. ... Targeting membrane trafficking in infection prophylaxis: dynamin inhibitors Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23 :90-101 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), on localization and cetuximab-induced ADCC in A431 and KJD cells ( Figure 1 ). In cell-based assays, cetuximab requires the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for induction of tumor cell killing ( Figure S2 ). As per clinical observations of tumor growth, cetuximab in the absence of PBMCs halts proliferation but does not elicit tumor cell killing ( Figure S2 A). In SCC cell lines, EGFR expression and endocytosis rates were variable ( Figure S2 C) ( Joseph et al., 2019 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). A431 cells express high plasma membrane EGFR ( Figure 1 A) and are used as a model of cetuximab sensitivity ( Goldstein et al., 1995 26. Goldstein, N.I. ∙ Prewett, M. ∙ Zuklys, K. ... Biological efficacy of a chimeric antibody to the epidermal growth factor receptor in a human tumor xenograft model Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1 :1311-1318 PubMed Google Scholar ). The KJD cell line is insensitive to cetuximab, with low plasma membrane bound cetuximab ( Figure 1 B) and reduced EGFR expression compared to A431 cells ( Figure S2 D). In untreated A431 cells, cetuximab localized to the plasma membrane and internalized structures over the 4 h assay period ( Figure 1 A), which would allow ADCC to occur. Dyngo4a increased surface cetuximab binding to EGFR ( Figure 1 A), with ∼38% of A431 dying specifically as result of cetuximab-induced ADCC ( Figure 1 C). The percentage of maximal tumor cell death increased significantly (p = 0.0001) when comparing cetuximab with or without Dyngo4a ( Figure 1 C). This was a consistent finding with multiple donor PBMCs despite innate variation in donor immune cell ADCC efficiency ( Figures S2 E and S2F). We observed a significant (p = 0.0001) increase in specific tumor cell death across multiple protocols of Dyngo4a treatment, with addition of Dyngo4a during the last hour of the 4 h ADCC assay showing the highest efficacy ( Figure 1 C). Dyngo4a effect is both cetuximab and PBMC dependent, as tumor cell killing with Dyngo4a only occurs when both the PBMCs and antibody are present ( Figure 1 C). Total surface fluorescence does not correlate with ADCC as total levels do not measure retention time or NK engagement. Fluorescence in Figure 1 B cetuximab 4 h-plus-Dyn 2×2 h appears increased due to cell rounding in this condition. KJD cells, which express lower EGFR on the plasma membrane after a 4 h incubation with cetuximab ( Figure 1 B), display relatively low cetuximab-induced ADCC (∼10% cell killing; Figure 1 C). Incubation with Dyngo4a increased both plasma membrane expression of EGFR ( Figure 1 B) and cetuximab-induced ADCC to greater than 40% cell killing ( Figure 1 C). Dyngo4a alone did not exhibit toxicity. Small molecule dynamin inhibitors Dynasore and Dynole showed non-ADCC-dependent toxicity to both tumor cells and PBMCs ( Figure S2 G).
If plasma membrane EGFR expression alone determines ADCC response, then we would expect that any pharmacological blockade of EGFR internalization would enhance ADCC. Inhibitors of clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) internalization, such as Pitstop2, caused EGFR to be trapped on the plasma membrane but did not increase ADCC in cetuximab-sensitive (A431) or resistant (KJD) cell lines ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S1 ). We previously observed by confocal and three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) that EGF remains diffuse on the plasma membrane when Pitstop2 is used ( Daniel et al., 2015 18. Daniel, J.A. ∙ Chau, N. ∙ Abdel-Hamid, M.K. ... Phenothiazine-derived antipsychotic drugs inhibit dynamin and clathrin-mediated endocytosis Traffic. 2015; 16 :635-654 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet with dynamin inhibitors, we observed clustering and recruitment of EGF into CCVs that cannot detach from the plasma membrane. The differential ADCC improvement suggests that clustering of plasma membrane EGFR is required for enhanced ADCC and that enhanced ADCC is not solely due to increased plasma membrane expression ( Figures S1 A–S1E). This clustering has been measured using biophysical techniques and similar conclusions proposed ( Kim et al., 2017 41. Kim, D.H. ∙ Kim, D.K. ∙ Zhou, K. ... Single particle tracking-based reaction progress kinetic analysis reveals a series of molecular mechanisms of cetuximab-induced EGFR processes in a single living cell Chem. Sci. (Camb.). 2017; 8 :4823-4832 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Endocytosis of HER2 is mediated via both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways ( Austin et al., 2004; Klapper et al., 2000; Lundmark et al., 2008 2. Austin, C.D. ∙ De Mazière, A.M. ∙ Pisacane, P.I. ... Endocytosis and sorting of ErbB2 and the site of action of cancer therapeutics trastuzumab and geldanamycin Mol. Biol.

Biol. 2008; 18 :1802-1808 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ) and fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis (FEME) ( Baldassarre et al., 2017; Boucrot et al., 2015 3. Baldassarre, T. ∙ Truesdell, P. ∙ Craig, A.W. Endophilin A2 promotes HER2 internalization and sensitivity to trastuzumab-based therapy in HER2-positive breast cancers Breast Cancer Res. 2017; 19 :110 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar 7. Boucrot, E. ∙ Ferreira, A.P. ∙ Almeida-Souza, L. ... Endophilin marks and controls a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway Nature. 2015; 517 :460-465 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because our SCC cell lines express HER2 ( Figure S2 D), we tested the impact of dynamin inhibition on trastuzumab-induced ADCC in SCC ( Figures 2 C and 2D) and HER2-positive breast cancer cells ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Trastuzumab-mediated tumor cell killing was improved. ADCC improvement increased most with trastuzumab in high HER2-expressing cells ( Figures 2 C–2F) ( Boero et al., 2015 6. Boero, S. ∙ Morabito, A. ∙ Banelli, B. ... Analysis of in vitro ADCC and clinical response to trastuzumab: possible relevance of FcγRIIIA/FcγRIIA gene polymorphisms and HER-2 expression levels on breast cancer cell lines J. Transl. Med. 2015; 13 :324 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) and with cetuximab in high EGFR-expressing cells ( Figures S1 D and S1E); thus, the effect is not due to non-specific activity of dynamin inhibition but is dependent on therapeutic mAb binding to a specific target on tumor cells. This also provides evidence that endocytosis inhibition improving ADCC is via tumor cell change and not alteration of immune cells (whereby functional activation of immune cells occurred independently of endocytosis and would equally improve all combinations).
Despite low transfection rates in SCC cells, the dynamin K44A dominant-negative mutant ( Damke et al., 1994 17. Damke, H. ∙ Baba, T. ∙ Warnock, D.E. ... Induction of mutant dynamin specifically blocks endocytic coated vesicle formation J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127 :915-934 Crossref Scopus (1064) PubMed Google Scholar ) significantly (p < 0.01) increases cetuximab-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. Small molecule inhibitors of dynamin may have off-target effects, but this result demonstrates that (1) specific dynamin inhibition increases mAb-mediated ADCC and (2) effects are not via immune cell dynamin or dopamine receptor inhibition or other effects as only tumor cells were transfected with the mutant.
Dyngo4a is not approved for clinical use ( McCluskey et al., 2013 53. McCluskey, A. ∙ Daniel, J.A. ∙ Hadzic, G. ... Building a better dynasore: the dyngo compounds potently inhibit dynamin and endocytosis Traffic. 2013; 14 :1272-1289 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ). The phenothiazine series of anti-psychotic drugs are potent dynamin inhibitors for transferrin ( Daniel et al., 2015 18. Daniel, J.A. ∙ Chau, N. ∙ Abdel-Hamid, M.K. ... Phenothiazine-derived antipsychotic drugs inhibit dynamin and clathrin-mediated endocytosis Traffic. 2015; 16 :635-654 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ) and EGFR internalization ( Selinfreund et al., 1986 79. Selinfreund, R. ∙ Lin, P.H. ∙ Cooper, J.L. ... Effects of phenothiazines on binding and processing of epidermal growth factor in 3T3 cells Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251 :C904-C911 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested PCZ, the better clinical option for human use compared to haloperidol based on side effect profiles, in combination with cetuximab in ADCC assays. Addition of PCZ with cetuximab resulted in a significant (p < 0.0001) and consistent induction of ADCC ( Figures 2 H and 2I). KJD plasma membrane EGF increased from 15% of total EGF with a plasma membrane distribution to 95% plasma membrane distribution following PCZ treatment by immunofluorescence (p < 0.001) ( Figure S2 I), replicating responder patient patterns reported ( Joseph et al., 2019 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We analyzed whether dynamin inhibition improved ADCC mediated by either lumretuzumab or dalotuzumab ( Figure S1 ). While EGFR internalization was blocked by either Dyngo4a ( Figures 1 A and 1B) or PCZ ( Figures S2 H and S2I), lumretuzumab and dalotuzumab continued to be endocytosed ( Figure S1 F) via an alternative internalization mechanism(s). Surface expression of receptors targeted by these antibodies is high on the cell lines tested; these antibodies are used at similar concentrations to cetuximab and trastuzumab, and both are IgG1 humanized therapeutic antibodies. ADCC was not increased with the addition of Dyngo4a or PCZ ( Figures S1 G and S1H). Thus, (1) improvement in ADCC is dependent on endocytosis inhibition, and (2) the induction of ADCC is not due simply to non-specific antibody cross-linking mechanistic effects as lumretuzumab and dalotuzumab serve as IgG1 isotype controls. While we were unable to rescue the efficacy of these antibodies for clinical use, these data provide strong evidence that membrane retention and clustering of receptors is key. Mechanisms whereby PCZ was increasing tumor cell antigen presentation, altering tumor cells or immune cell activation, would all occur in these experiments in the same way as any effects for cetuximab and trastuzumab. Thus, in vitro improvement in ADCC is dependent on temporarily halting endocytosis. Anti-CD20 antibody anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo was also augmented when receptor internalization was blocked ( Roghanian et al., 2015 72. Roghanian, A. ∙ Teige, I. ∙ Mårtensson, L. ... Antagonistic human FcγRIIB (CD32B) antibodies have anti-tumor activity and overcome resistance to antibody therapy in vivo Cancer Cell. 2015; 27 :473-488 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Breast cancer cells lines expressing EGFR ( STAR Methods ) were subjected to an ADCC assay in the presence of cetuximab ( Figure S1 A). The level of EGF endocytosis ( Figure S1 B) and cell viability ( Figure S1 C) of each cell line was measured in the presence of Dyngo4a or Pitstop2. While breast cancer cell lines had similar levels of surface EGFR as measured by mean fluorescence intensity ( Figure S1 D), cetuximab-mediated ADCC was higher for MDA-MB-468 cells ( Figure S1 A). Addition of either Dyngo4a or Pitstop2 increased surface receptor levels in all three cells lines, again to similar levels ( Figure S1 D); however, increased ADCC was only observed with Dyngo4a in all cell lines ( Figure S1 E). In combination with published data ( Kim et al., 2017 41. Kim, D.H. ∙ Kim, D.K. ∙ Zhou, K. ... Single particle tracking-based reaction progress kinetic analysis reveals a series of molecular mechanisms of cetuximab-induced EGFR processes in a single living cell Chem. Sci. (Camb.). 2017; 8 :4823-4832 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), this supports the hypothesis that increased surface receptor clustering may increase therapeutic antibody clustering and concentrate the IgG domains, in turn increasing FcγR activation of immune cells.
We next investigated which dynamin-dependent pathways were inhibited by PCZ and imaged the tumor cell-immune cell interface by electron microscopy to analyze effects of PCZ on cetuximab and EGF endocytosis in A431 cells and on the cancer-immune cell interaction. Figures 3 A–3D illustrate ADCC assays in the presence of cetuximab-HRP and PBMC, without or with PCZ. In control conditions, the immune cell/tumor cell interfaces were rarer, the NK cell contacts with tumor cells were sparse, and cetuximab was internalized into endosomes at the 10 min time point. In the presence of PCZ, numerous immune cell/tumor cell interactions were present. NK cells formed multiple long synapses with the tumor cells, seen as a “zippering” effect of the membranes, and cetuximab-HRP was clearly observed on the tumor cell plasma membrane, being densest where NK cells zippered to the tumor cells, and in tubular structures.
In EGF-HRP-treated A431 cells with no PCZ, EGF-HRP localized to multivesicular endosomes ( Figure 3 E, left), characteristic of EGF ligand uptake ( Futter et al., 1996 23. Futter, C.E. ∙ Pearse, A. ∙ Hewlett, L.J. ... Multivesicular endosomes containing internalized EGF-EGF receptor complexes mature and then fuse directly with lysosomes J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132 :1011-1023 Crossref Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCZ treatment resulted in reduced transport of EGF to multivesicular endosomes ( Figure 3 E, right), demonstrating that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is slowed. This is observed clearly at the 30 min time point ( Figure 3 E). The EGF-triggered uptake of EGFR also occurs through the dynamin-dependent FEME pathway, defined as fast formation (seconds) of tubulo-vesicular carriers that are blocked by dynamin inhibitors ( Boucrot et al., 2015 7. Boucrot, E. ∙ Ferreira, A.P. ∙ Almeida-Souza, L. ... Endophilin marks and controls a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway Nature. 2015; 517 :460-465 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). Putative FEME tubules are visible in PCZ-treated and not in untreated A431 cells ( Figure 3 E), suggesting inhibition of the FEME pathway due to PCZ-mediated dynamin inhibition. This is in agreement with our ADCC studies, whereby dynamin inhibition by dynamin K44A dominant-negative mutation, by Dyngo4a, or with PCZ is more effective than inhibition of clathrin alone.
Dynamin inhibition has the potential to increase receptor signaling; thus, extensive signaling analysis was undertaken. In A431 cells, phospho-EGFR (p-EGFR), p-ERK, and p-Akt were detected on stimulation with EGF and when unstimulated, suggesting that both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K/Akt pathways are constitutively activated ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Cetuximab treatment inhibited both signaling pathways, while PCZ treatment diminished EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and slightly reduced p-ERK expression. Combination of cetuximab and PCZ resulted in the abrogation of phosphorylation of both ERK and Akt. In contrast to the effect of PCZ alone, Dyngo4a resulted in increased phosphorylation of both EGFR and Akt, even in the absence of EGF stimulation, in agreement with previous observations ( Garay et al., 2015 24. Garay, C. ∙ Judge, G. ∙ Lucarelli, S. ... Epidermal growth factor-stimulated Akt phosphorylation requires clathrin or ErbB2 but not receptor endocytosis Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26 :3504-3519 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). We investigated the mTOR pathway following drug treatment combinations ( Figure S3 ). In A431 cells ( Figures S3 A and S3B), p-mTOR at Ser2481, an indicator for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) ( Copp et al., 2009 16. Copp, J. ∙ Manning, G. ∙ Hunter, T. TORC-specific phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR): phospho-Ser2481 is a marker for intact mTOR signaling complex 2 Cancer Res. 2009; 69 :1821-1827 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), increased in all experimental conditions. Decrease in p-Akt did not affect p-mTOR at Ser2448, an indicator for activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) ( Chiang and Abraham, 2005 12. Chiang, G.G. ∙ Abraham, R.T. Phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) at Ser-2448 is mediated by p70S6 kinase J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :25485-25490 Crossref Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ), and p-PRAS40 at Ser183 remained unchanged. PRAS40 is a subunit of mTORC1, which suppresses mTORC1 activity when bound to the complex ( Nascimento and Ouwens, 2009 59. Nascimento, E.B. ∙ Ouwens, D.M. PRAS40: target or modulator of mTORC1 signalling and insulin action? Arch. Physiol. Biochem. 2009; 115 :163-175 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is phosphorylated at Ser183 by mTOR of mTORC1 and at Thr246 by Akt. In conditions eliciting a decrease in p-Akt (C, PCZ, PCZ+C; Figure 4 ), a decline in p-PRAS40 at Thr246 was observed ( Figures S3 A and S3B). The decline of p-PRAS40 at Thr246 is consistent with the observation that inhibited Akt could not phosphorylate PRAS40 at this residue. Dyngo4a alone and the combination of cetuximab and Dyngo4a increased p-Akt ( Figures 4 A and 4B), explaining the increase in p-PRAS40 at Thr246 observed in both experimental conditions ( Figures S3 A and S3B).
In cetuximab-resistant KJD cells, phosphorylation of EGFR increased upon EGF stimulation; however, p-Akt was detected in the absence of ligand stimulation. Thus, the PI3K/Akt pathway is constitutively activated ( Figures 4 C and 4D). When treated with cetuximab, phosphorylation of both ERK and EGFR decreased, whereas Akt phosphorylation remained unchanged. Thus, cetuximab is unable to effectively inhibit signaling in these resistant cells. PCZ treatment abolished phosphorylation of Akt. The combination of both cetuximab and PCZ elicited a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt, reinstating the signaling inhibition effect of cetuximab. Dyngo4a increased phosphorylation of both EGFR and Akt, whereas decreased p-ERK expression was observed. Cetuximab and PCZ in combination inhibit both p-ERK and p-Akt. In Figure 4 C, additional treatments whereby endocytosis was inhibited before mAb addition did not show differences. We found that p-mTOR at Ser2481 (mTORC2) remained consistent throughout experimental conditions. A slight decrease was observed in cells treated with cetuximab-plus-Dyngo4a ( Figures S3 C and S3D). PCZ alone and in combination with cetuximab caused a decrease in p-mTOR at Ser2448 (mTORC1), and a slight decrease was observed in cells treated with cetuximab-plus-Dyngo4a. Decreased mTORC1 phosphorylation did not affect mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Ser183 as it remained consistent in most of the experimental conditions but increased when cells were stimulated with EGF. Dyngo4a-treated cells exhibited increased p-PRAS40 at Ser183. This was not observed in combination with cetuximab. Treatments with both PCZ alone and in combination with cetuximab diminished p-Akt at Ser473 ( Figures 4 C and 4D), with a decrease in the phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Thr246 ( Figures S3 C and S3D).
PCZ treatment increased both p-HER2 and p-HER3 ( Figures S3 E and S3F) and in cells treated with combination therapy. Other RTKs reported conferring resistance in HNSCC ( Ongkeko et al., 2005 64. Ongkeko, W.M. ∙ Altuna, X. ∙ Weisman, R.A. ... Expression of protein tyrosine kinases in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2005; 124 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) were phosphorylated ( Figures S3 G and S3H). PCZ inhibited phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 ( Figure S3 I). Several downstream targets of Akt were affected by the decrease in p-Akt at Ser473 such as p-PRAS40 ( Figure S3 J). Decrease in p-PRAS40 was observed in cells that were treated with either PCZ or the combination therapy. A decrease in the activation of downstream targets of mTORC1 such as S6 ribosomal protein and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 was observed ( Figures S3 K and S3L). In summary, PCZ has no adverse effects on signaling pathways and is potentially able to inhibit Akt and PRAS40 phosphorylation, which is correlated with radiotherapy resistance ( Zhang et al., 2009 96. Zhang, F. ∙ Beharry, Z.M. ∙ Harris, T.E. ... PIM1 protein kinase regulates PRAS40 phosphorylation and mTOR activity in FDCP1 cells Cancer Biol. Ther. 2009; 8 :846-853 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We utilized murine models with KJD xenografts either left untreated or injected with indicated doses of PCZ. After 45 min post-injection, xenograft tumors were harvested and assayed for EGF binding availability on the cell surface as described ( Joseph et al., 2019 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cetuximab binds to the ligand-binding domain of the EGFR, so EGF-Alexa 488 staining was used as a surrogate marker for cetuximab binding sites. EGF cell surface staining increased, and therefore, the number of cetuximab binding sites on the cell surface increased when mice were treated with PCZ when compared to no drug treatment ( Figure 5 A). Six xenograft tumors were analyzed. Surface binding of EGF in KJD xenografts is virtually undetectable, while surface binding of EGF in mice treated to inhibit dynamin is significantly increased (p = 0.0159) ( Figure 5 A). Thus, PCZ treatment can be used to redistribute target receptors in vivo . Initial dose studies demonstrated that a minimum of 0.6 mg/kg was required to alter surface distribution.
Initial experiments were performed on non-obese diabetic (NOD)-scid gamma (NSG) mice with cetuximab-sensitive A431 xenografts treated with cetuximab F(ab′) 2 fragment (inhibits EGFR signaling only) or cetuximab (inhibits signaling and induces ADCC) in the presence of a partially reconstituted immune system (NK cells only) ( Figure 5 B). Tumor growth stabilization can occur via signaling inhibition, but without ADCC, the tumors’ growth rebounds ( Figure 5 B). Patient-derived xenograft models in SCC are unsuitable as tumors regress for weeks before re-establishing, differing genetically from the original patient tumor ( Facompre et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2013 21. Facompre, N.D. ∙ Sahu, V. ∙ Montone, K.T. ... Barriers to generating PDX models of HPV-related head and neck cancer Laryngoscope. 2017; 127 :2777-2783 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Peng, S. ∙ Creighton, C.J. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Tumor grafts derived from patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma authentically maintain the molecular and histologic characteristics of human cancers J. Transl. Med. 2013; 11 :198 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used NSG mice and NSG-A2 mice xenograft models of cetuximab-resistant KJD tumors to enable us to incorporate the role of PBMC in this model system ( Figures 5 C and 5D). For the cetuximab-resistant KJD xenografts we saw, as is observed in patient responses, the resistant tumors showed initial response to cetuximab, with some tumor regression and stabilization before tumor progression occurred ( Figure 5 C). However, with combination therapy, a complete reduction of tumor volume was observed ( Figure 5 C). Due to the rapid onset of graft versus host in this model, an NSG-A2 mouse model with matched human PBMCs was established to enable the duration of the experiment to be extended ( Figure 5 D). PCZ alone on this dosing schedule showed no anti-tumor effect as a monotherapy. The delivery of PCZ caused the mice to be drowsy for ∼30 min. No other side effects outwith tumor burden and cetuximab therapy were noted. No weight loss was observed in the mice except after therapy completion, just prior to onset of graft versus host syndrome. All xenograft models showed that therapeutic response is dependent on active PBMC being present ( Figures 5 B–5D). KJD tumors showed initial responses in all mice treated with cetuximab as a monotherapy or in the cetuximab-plus-PCZ combination. However, the KJD tumors in the cetuximab-plus-PCZ with PBMC combination arm continued to regress and were resolved in a number of animals, significantly (p = 0.0004) more efficacious than cetuximab monotherapy ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Tumors in the cetuximab/PCZ arm had significantly (p = 0.0042) lower final tumor volumes than with cetuximab alone ( Figures 5 C, 5D, S4 B, and S4C). Moreover, no metastases were found in the combination therapy animals in which tumor clearance had occurred, while all untreated animals had lung metastasis ( Figure 5 D, inset). The graphs of Figures S4 A–S4C represent individual tumor volume fold change of each animal in the experiments shown in Figures 5 B–5D, respectively. Figure S4 D shows the survival curve of the animals of the experiment represented in Figure 5 D. Figures S4 E–S4G demonstrates pathology of murine model after dissection. The cetuximab F(ab′) 2 fragments are functional in EGFR binding and signaling inhibition but show minimal effect on tumor growth when compared to intact cetuximab. Efficacy is thus dependent on the IgG1 Fc domain of the antibody ( Figure S4 A).
In an investigator-initiated study with Merck KGaA, we tested whether PCZ could also improve avelumab anti-tumor effects. BALB/c mice were challenged with mouse colon carcinoma (CT26.WT) cells ( Figure 6 ) or mouse renal adenocarcinoma (RENCA) cells ( Figure S5 ). These cell lines have been used previously to test immunotherapies in mice. Therapeutic arms are described in the STAR Methods . Figure 6 shows CT26.WT tumor growth curves for each mouse for different treatment conditions ( Figures 6 A–6F) and combined growth curves ( Figure 6 G). Survival curves are shown in Figure 6 H. The avelumab-plus-PCZ combination therapy showed a statistically significant improvement ( ∗∗ p < 0.01) in inhibition of primary tumor growth compared to control arms (PCZ only and untreated) and avelumab-only treatment, which showed no significance compared to controls. PCZ alone has no significant effect when compared to control. Mice in the F(ab′) 2 fragment arms, both with and without PCZ, developed autoimmune disorder leading to death (discussed below). Figures 6 J and 6K show a full analysis of the effect of avelumab and PCZ combination therapy versus monotherapy or control arms on CT26.WT tumor growth. Data are plotted as tumor volume (fold change) in Figure 6 J and as absolute tumor volume in Figure 6 K. Only the combination therapeutic arm showed statistical significance compared with both untreated and PCZ arm ( ∗∗ p < 0.01) at day 34 post first treatment dose (day 49 post tumor challenge). Figure S5 shows RENCA tumor growth curves for each mouse for different treatment conditions ( Figures S5 A–S5F) and combined growth curves ( Figure S5 G). Survival curves are shown in Figure S5 H. Surprisingly, no significant differences were observed between any therapeutic conditions for RENCA tumors.
CT26.WT and RENCA tumor-bearing mice in the avelumab F(ab′) 2 and the avelumab F(ab′) 2 -plus-PCZ arms did not show side effects upon the first three (CT26.WT; Figures 6 C and 6D) and two injections (RENCA; Figures S5 C and S5D). After the fourth injection, CT26.WT tumor-bearing animals became weak and lethargic. 4 out of 12 F(ab′) 2 -treated animals died, two animals from the F(ab′) 2 arm and two from the F(ab′) 2 -plus-PCZ arm ( Figures 6 C–6D, asterisk). Similarly, after the third injection, two out of four RENCA tumor-bearing animals in the F(ab′) 2 -plus-PCZ group died ( Figure S5 D, asterisk). Post-injection lethargy occurred in all mice in CT26.WT groups after the fifth injection of avelumab. Two animals from avelumab and one from avelumab-plus-PCZ groups died ( Figures 6 E–6F, asterisk). At this point, all F(ab′) 2 and avelumab injections were halted. Similar effects were reported by Mall and colleagues ( Mall et al., 2015 51. Mall, C. ∙ Sckisel, G.D. ∙ Proia, D.A. ... Repeated PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody administration induces fatal xenogeneic hypersensitivity reactions in a murine model of breast cancer OncoImmunology. 2015; 5 :e1075114 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autopsied animals were noted to have reddened bowel, pronounced liver vasculature, darkened spleens, and for one, bright red lungs. Analysis of the mice suggested segmental vasculitis or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Autopsies suggested that the mouse immune system was producing antibodies against the injected avelumab F(ab′) 2 fragments, causing symptoms similar to autoimmune disease. This correlates with our observations whereby administration of proteolytically degraded anti-PD-L1 antibody (BioXcell) to mice resulted in the death of 30 animals due to autoimmune effects triggered after the fourth injection. Conversely, animals (n = 20) treated with IgG1 isotype control showed no adverse effects, suggesting that F(ab′) 2 fragments released as a result of anti-PD-L1 antibody degradation induced autoimmune disease. This suggests that variant chain as opposed to intact IgG1 antibody is autoimmunogenic.
Mice that had either not developed tumors in response to RENCA tumor cell injection (CT26.WT naive mice [n = 2]) or that had demonstrated complete tumor clearance on the avelumab F(ab′) 2 fragments (n = 1), avelumab (n = 1), or avelumab-plus-PCZ (n = 3) arm therapies from the CT26.WT models were rechallenged with CT26.WT cells. All control (naive) mice developed tumors that grew until the ethical end point ( Figure 6 L). In contrast, no mice that were survivors from the previous CT26.WT experiments regrew tumors after the challenge ( Figure 6 L). These mice remained tumor free and healthy for over 300 days following rechallenge ( Figure 6 M). The difference between the naive mice (n = 2) group versus the prechallenged tumor-survivors clearance group (n = 5) was statistically significant ( ∗∗ p < 0.01).
As immune cells, specifically T cells, express PD-L1, increased avelumab-mediated ADCC may have the side effect of T cell ablation. T cell frequency in blood, inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs), and spleen and within the tumors of CT26.WT tumor-bearing animals ( Figures S6 A–S6C) and in the blood of RENCA tumor-bearing animals ( Figure S6 D) was analyzed at the indicated time points (n = 3/time point). For gating strategies, see Methods S1 . While only avelumab-plus-PCZ showed a lower T cell count in blood 7 days post-treatment compared to untreated control (day 0); no differences in T cell ratios were observed in less dynamic organs such as iLNs and spleen ( Figures S6 A and S6B) in the CT26.WT tumor group. Tumor-infiltrating T cells increased in all groups at day 7 ( Figure S6 B). While some decrease was noted at the end point, no statistical comparison could be made between groups due to tumor regression ( Figure S6 C). In RENCA tumor-bearing mice, we observed an initial drop in the blood T cell level after 1 week, with no further decrease, showing no statistical difference between avelumab versus avelumab-plus-PCZ groups ( Figure S6 D). Thus, from both tumor models we conclude that increasing anti-PD-L1-mediated ADCC efficacy does not adversely affect the T cell population. The differences observed between control and combination therapy in blood could be explained by the high dynamism of this tissue. Analysis of tumors at earlier stages of treatment would be desirable to determine the kinetics of T cell infiltration and activation, as on treatment completion, no tumor was left to analyze.
Therapy failed to inhibit RENCA cell growth in vivo , and yet RENCA cells demonstrate high surface PD-L1 levels in vitro ( O’Shaughnessy et al., 2018 62. O’Shaughnessy, M.J. ∙ Murray, K.S. ∙ La Rosa, S.P. ... Systemic Antitumor Immunity by PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibition Is Potentiated by Vascular-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy of Primary Tumors Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :592-599 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). We analyzed the frequency of CT26.WT and RENCA tumor cells expressing MHC-I and MHC-II surface molecules, CT26.WT tumors expressing PD-1, and RENCA tumors expressing PD-L1 ( Figures S6 E–S6L). This was not completed for the CT26.WT avelumab-plus-PCZ combination arm as no tumors remained following treatment. For the CT26.WT model, a reduction in the frequency of tumor cells expressing surface MHC-I/MHC-II during tumor growth was observed across all treatment groups ( Figures S6 E and S6F). In the CT26.WT tumor-bearing mice, which did not respond to any therapy, the frequency of tumor cells expressing surface PD-1 was also downregulated ( Figure S6 I, end point); however, this was not seen at 7 days for tumor or T cells ( Figures S6 G and S6H). PD-1 levels in responding mice were not investigated, as the mice were alive with no current tumor mass to be analyzed. At the RENCA model ethical end point, only 1% of tumor cells and less than 0.5% of tumor cells in control and treated animals, respectively, were still expressing MHC-I ( Figure S6 J). Frequency of tumor MHC-II + cells was slightly reduced, but not significant, across all treatment groups compared to control group ( Figure S6 K). PD-L1 expression was not detected on any of the analyzed RENCA tumors at the experimental end point. RENCA demonstrate high surface PD-L1 levels ( O’Shaughnessy et al., 2018 62. O’Shaughnessy, M.J. ∙ Murray, K.S. ∙ La Rosa, S.P. ... Systemic Antitumor Immunity by PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibition Is Potentiated by Vascular-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy of Primary Tumors Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :592-599 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the end point tumors showed none ( Figure S6 L). The downregulation of PD-L1 may explain lack of therapeutic response.
Both RENCA and CT26.WT cells showed endogenous surface PD-L1 expression ( O’Shaughnessy et al., 2018; Ohno et al., 2017 62. O’Shaughnessy, M.J. ∙ Murray, K.S. ∙ La Rosa, S.P. ...

Lack of interleukin-6 in the tumor microenvironment augments type-1 immunity and increases the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy Cancer Sci. 2017; 108 :1959-1966 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). The distribution of PD-L1 in CT26.WT control cells and after treatment with Dyngo4a is shown ( Figure S7 A). In the presence of Dyngo4a, surface levels of PD-L1 increased. The addition of PCZ also inhibited Akt phosphorylation in this cell model ( Figures S7 B and S7C). Figure S7 D demonstrates that ADCC is significantly (p < 0.01) increased in CT26.WT cells treated with anti-PD-L1 antibody and PCZ combination. Figure S7 E shows post-fixation labeling of CT26.WT murine tumors pre- and post-PCZ infusion, demonstrating the increased level of PD-L1 surface staining. This is similar to the change in distribution noted for EGF binding sites in mouse xenograft tumors ( Figure 5 A). Thus, as we have demonstrated for cetuximab, trastuzumab (see also Scaltriti et al. [2009] 73. Scaltriti, M. ∙ Verma, C. ∙ Guzman, M. ... Lapatinib, a HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, induces stabilization and accumulation of HER2 and potentiates trastuzumab-dependent cell cytotoxicity Oncogene. 2009; 28 :803-814 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ), and rituximab ( Roghanian et al., 2015 72. Roghanian, A. ∙ Teige, I. ∙ Mårtensson, L. ...

Having established that the use of PCZ enhances mAb therapy and reverses innate resistance with respect to both ADCC and signaling mechanisms, we tested whether PCZ could be safely used to redistribute target receptors of mAb therapies in patients. A pilot clinical study (HREC/15/QPAH/48) was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki with patients recruited with written informed consent (pilot clinical study registration ACTRN:12619001051134). All patient baseline assessments were undertaken within 2 weeks of commencing study treatment. Baseline assessment included full history, cancer staging, general physical examination, skin assessment, complete blood count, and serum biochemistry ( Figures S8 A–S8D).

Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined surface binding of EGF-Alexa 488 in multiple areas of tumor from 4 mm punch biopsies. Between the pre- and post-PCZ samples, a single intravenous delivery of 0.8 mg/kg PCZ was delivered. Of five recruited subjects, four had tumor samples that could be analyzed pre- and post-infusion. The other subject’s biopsy samples consisted of extracellular matrix with minimal cells. For the four satisfactory tumor biopsy samples, images of EGF-Alexa 488 taken across the entire biopsy sample showed variation in EGF binding. EGF binding was enhanced post-infusion ( Figures 7 and S8 E). Patients showed no clinically relevant changes in vital signs during and post-PCZ infusion ( Figures S8 B–S8D). While three fields of view for each patient biopsy are shown, all fields available across the whole biopsy were analyzed. Mean fluorescence intensity was measured for all fields for each patient biopsy (n = 4 to n = 18) ( Figure 7 B). All samples showed an increase in surface EGF-Alexa 488 binding, a surrogate marker for cetuximab binding sites, which was significant (patient 1, ∗∗ p = 0.004; patient 2, ∗ p = 0.028; patient 4, ∗∗ p = 0.0028; patient 5, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001 using Mann–Whitney, two-tailed). In tumor areas in which high heterogeneity of EGF binding was observed, EGF binding in tumors became more homogeneous post-infusion. Controls and further analysis were performed on the tumor samples ( Figures S8 E–S8H). At 0 min of EGF uptake, only background tissue fluorescence can be observed ( Figure S8 E). DAPI nuclear stain is membrane permeable; thus, cell nuclei can be visualized. In non-permeabilized samples, both post-fixation labeling of the EGFR and a 60 min internalization of anti-EGFR antibody (sc-120) detect no change between surface pre- and post-infusion labeling ( Figure S8 F). Steady-state (post-fixation) staining of the EGFR does not reflect the changes observed in the ex vivo pulse-chase EGF-Alexa 488 uptake assays. Neither total nor surface expression of EGFR predicts response to treatment with anti-EGFR drugs in SCC, and EGFR expression does not consistently correlate with disease progression ( Chung et al., 2009; Helman et al., 2010; Wheeler et al., 2010 14.

Oncol. 2010; 7 :493-507 Crossref Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, small numbers of EGFR on the plasma membrane are easily detected by current high-avidity, high-affinity anti-EGFR antibodies, whereas EGF-Alexa 488 is a directly conjugated fluorophore detected only when the EGFRs are clustered, as opposed to dispersed, on the plasma membrane ( Daniel et al., 2015 18. Daniel, J.A. ∙ Chau, N. ∙ Abdel-Hamid, M.K. ... Phenothiazine-derived antipsychotic drugs inhibit dynamin and clathrin-mediated endocytosis Traffic. 2015; 16 :635-654 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ) and reflects a kinetic change. Our data therefore suggest that infusion with PCZ clusters the EGFR on the plasma membrane of tumor cells in patients. Tumor samples that have been permeabilized ( Figure S8 G) demonstrate that EGFR is present in the pre-infusion samples but is mainly intracellular, while all tissue is competent for Dextran (10K) fluid phase uptake, and thus, the tissue is not necrotic ( Figure S8 H). All internalization experiments were started within 15 min of biopsy completion.

Section: Discussion

EGFR in patient tumors that had escaped endocytosis correlated 100% with tumor regression in the context of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy ( Joseph et al., 2019 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). This led to the concept that temporarily halting endocytosis of receptors that are the targets of mAb therapies may be used to improve clinical outcome. Here, we show that PCZ, used in laboratory studies as an endocytosis inhibitor and in clinic as an anti-emetic and anti-psychotic therapy for decades, can be used to inhibit endocytosis in humans reversibly and potentially safely (though additional trial data will be needed to fully assess safety). The heterogeneity of patient tumor cells is decreased and become homogeneous with regard to the drug target availability. This represents a potentially disruptive change in clinical approaches to improve therapeutic targeting as the opportunity of temporarily moving drug targets within patient cells becomes possible. In the context of ADCC, we show that antibody targeting and immune response can be improved for anti-PD-L1 (avelumab), anti-HER2 (trastuzumab), and anti-EGFR (cetuximab), where receptor endocytosis is dynamin dependent via either clathrin-mediated endocytosis or FEME. No improvement in ADCC is seen with anti-ErbB3 (lumretuzumab) or anti-IGF-1R (dalotuzumab) IgG1 antibodies whose endocytosis is not dynamin dependent, but the potential remains for other clinical compounds to slow differential internalization pathways in order to improve efficacy. Other therapies outside of the cancer context may also be improved via PCZ, such as the anti-HIV antibodies mediating an ADCC response ( Lee and Kent, 2018; Mayr et al., 2017; von Bredow et al., 2016 47. Lee, W.S. ∙ Kent, S.J. Anti-HIV-1 antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity: is there more to antibodies than neutralization? Curr. Opin.

Virol. 2016; 90 :6127-6139 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Regarding specificity, tumor cells expressing the dynamin dominant-negative mutation K44A undergo increased ADCC. Small molecule inhibition of dynamin via Dyngo4a or the phenothiazine series also enhances ADCC. PCZ is a dynamin inhibitor ( Daniel et al., 2015 18. Daniel, J.A. ∙ Chau, N. ∙ Abdel-Hamid, M.K. ... Phenothiazine-derived antipsychotic drugs inhibit dynamin and clathrin-mediated endocytosis Traffic. 2015; 16 :635-654 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ) that concentrates in cell membranes due to its hydrophobicity and can bind to multiple cellular targets. Our in vivo data show that increased ADCC efficacy is reliant on (1) a halt in endocytosis, (2) the IgG1 chain of the antibody, (3) the specific expression of target receptor on the tumor cells, and (4) the presence of immune cells. In both in vivo models, the receptor (EGFR or PD-L1) exposure is increased on the tumor cell surface. The data show that total surface levels do not correlate with response but rather that membrane retention time and receptor clustering are integral. This may be as simple as, in the context of antibody therapy, clustering and exposure of bound IgG1 chains of mAbs better activate immune cells via the FcR. Our combined data show that PCZ may bind multiple targets but that it is the inhibition of endocytosis in the presence of antibody therapy and immune response that underlies efficacy. If PCZ were acting via additional mechanisms (non-endocytosis dependent), then this effect would have been also observed with lumretuzumab or dalotuzumab and would not show antibody or receptor expression specificity.
For the therapeutic mAb-PCZ combination, the multiple cellular effects of PCZ are advantageous. Inhibition of dynamin or clathrin-mediated endocytosis and FEME leads to an increase in the expression of all RTKs on the membrane. However, as demonstrated herein, PCZ is additionally an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation. Akt phosphorylation is central to the RTK signaling cascade and PI3K/Akt activation pathways critical for metabolic, growth, proliferation, and survival pathways. Long-term chronic use of PCZ as an anti-psychotic demonstrates that, with correct pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, no significant detrimental effects of these signaling outcomes occurs. Over a lifetime of PCZ use, patients show increased incidence of metabolic syndrome and decreased tumor incidence ( Motohashi et al., 1991; Thonnard-Neumann, 1968 56. Motohashi, N. ∙ Sakagami, H. ∙ Kamata, K. ... Cytotoxicity and differentiation-inducing activity of phenothiazine and benzo[a]phenothiazine derivatives Anticancer Res. 1991; 11 :1933-1937 PubMed Google Scholar 88. Thonnard-Neumann, E. Phenothiazines and diabetes in hospitalized women Am. J. Psychiatry. 1968; 124 :978-982 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Advantageously in the context of mAb therapy, the proposed use of PCZ is short term, negating side effects of chronic use.
PCZ as monotherapy had no anti-tumor effects, perhaps as inhibition lasts for approximately 4 h and is reversible. However, Akt inhibition decreases the potential for deleterious effects and may increase the fragility of the tumor cells during mAb therapy. Downstream of Akt, PRAS40 phosphorylation is reduced. PRAS40 can regulate apoptosis in cancer cells, expression correlates with tumor progression, and decrease of p-PRAS40 expression promotes apoptosis and alters cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy ( Chong, 2016; Nascimento et al., 2006; Nascimento and Ouwens, 2009; Thedieck et al., 2007 13. Chong, Z.Z. Targeting PRAS40 for multiple diseases Drug Discov. Today. 2016; 21 :1222-1231 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar 59. Nascimento, E.B. ∙ Ouwens, D.M.

Phosphorylation of PRAS40 may play a role in radiation-induced resistance in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells ( Zhang et al., 2009 96. Zhang, F. ∙ Beharry, Z.M. ∙ Harris, T.E. ... PIM1 protein kinase regulates PRAS40 phosphorylation and mTOR activity in FDCP1 cells Cancer Biol. Ther. 2009; 8 :846-853 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). The phenothiazine series of anti-psychotic drugs (APDs) are currently used in patients with advanced cancer in the palliative setting to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety; thus, there is potential to decrease radiotherapy resistance.
The traditional on-target effect of phenothiazines is thought to be dopamine receptor inhibition. In our in vivo data, PCZ alone does not increase efficacy compared with mAb-plus-PCZ combination. Dopamine inhibition via domperidone does not increase mAb-mediated ADCC in our assays. However, dopamine receptor inhibition can increase anti-tumor immunity by cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( Figueroa et al., 2017 22. Figueroa, C. ∙ Gálvez-Cancino, F. ∙ Oyarce, C. ... Inhibition of dopamine receptor D3 signaling in dendritic cells increases antigen cross-presentation to CD8 + T-cells favoring anti-tumor immunity J. Neuroimmunol. 2017; 303 :99-107 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a role of peripheral dopamine in tumor immunity is established (reviewed in Zhang et al. [2017] 97. Zhang, X. ∙ Liu, Q. ∙ Liao, Q. ... Potential Roles of Peripheral Dopamine in Tumor Immunity J. Cancer. 2017; 8 :2966-2973 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, this may be an additional advantageous mechanism in patient therapy.
Clinical oncology has been revolutionized by the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. While with conventional therapies resistance routinely develops, a subset of patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors show long-lasting, durable immunological and clinical responses. However, a number of patients gets no initial or further response, and late relapses are evident with longer follow-up, demonstrating the emergence of acquired resistance. Clinical trial data identify three populations of patients: (1) those who respond initially and continue to respond (responders), (2) those who fail to ever respond, and (3) those who initially respond but eventually develop disease progression ( Jenkins et al., 2018; O’Donnell et al., 2017; Pitt et al., 2016; Restifo et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2017 36.

Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3423) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we demonstrate that addition of PCZ to avelumab as combination therapy markedly improves therapeutic response in mice with CT26.WT tumors. In contrast, no enhanced efficacy was induced in mice carrying RENCA tumors. This was due to the almost complete downregulation of PD-L1 by RENCA cells in vivo . Thus, altering PD-L1 localization to improve targeting is not possible in this model and may reflect possible cause for treatment failure in patients. These findings highlight the crucial role of availability and persistence of the molecule targeted by the mAb at the tumor cell surface. Our data suggest that enhanced therapeutic efficacy observed in the CT26.WT model is, at least in part, due to improvement in ADCC mediated by the IgG1 of avelumab. Our results showed no evidence of treatment stripping T cells in any of the evaluated tissues, which corroborates with studies showing that avelumab can induce lysis of tumor cells via ADCC in vitro but not against immune cell subsets in humans ( Boyerinas et al., 2015; Hamilton and Rath, 2017 8. Boyerinas, B. ∙ Jochems, C. ∙ Fantini, M. ... Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity Activity of a Novel Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Avelumab (MSB0010718C) on Human Tumor Cells Cancer Immunol. Res. 2015; 3 :1148-1157 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Hamilton, G. ∙ Rath, B. Avelumab: combining immune checkpoint inhibition and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2017; 17 :515-523 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). The F(ab′) 2 fragments of avelumab caused serious adverse events in animal models, and antibody stability prior to injection was crucial. This may have implications for therapeutic antibody development.
Mice that had cleared tumors showed no tumor growth when rechallenged, consistent with the induction of a potent memory immune response. Our results show that combination treatment significantly enhances antibody-mediated killing of tumor cells and tumor clearance, which may result in increased long-term anti-tumor adaptive and memory immunity responses with potential therapeutic relevance, although the immunologic determinants remain to be investigated in detail. Significantly, our data suggest that all mice in the PCZ-avelumab combination arm that responded initially with complete tumor regression were protected from tumor engraftment with a subsequent CT26.WT tumor cell re-challenge. This higher rate of clearance and subsequent protection suggests that the combination model may be used to analyze the mechanism underlying long-term efficacy of the treatment. Differential Fc-receptor engagement can drive an anti-tumor vaccine effect ( DiLillo and Ravetch, 2015 19. DiLillo, D.J. ∙ Ravetch, J.V. Differential Fc-Receptor Engagement Drives an Anti-tumor Vaccinal Effect Cell. 2015; 161 :1035-1045 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ) and could conceivably be induced by combination therapy of ADCC-mediating monoclonal antibodies and PCZ. Expansion of intratumoral memory T cells (CD8+) in response to PD-1 blockade has been demonstrated and is more pronounced in patients responding to therapy ( Ribas et al., 2016 71. Ribas, A. ∙ Shin, D.S. ∙ Zaretsky, J. ... PD-1 Blockade Expands Intratumoral Memory T Cells Cancer Immunol. Res. 2016; 4 :194-203 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a key role for CD8+ memory T cells in mediating anti-PD-1 activity and clinical efficacy ( O’Donnell et al., 2017 61. O’Donnell, J.S. ∙ Long, G.V. ∙ Scolyer, R.A. ... Resistance to PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibition Cancer Treat. Rev. 2017; 52 :71-81 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). Studies have identified distinct transcriptional programs associated with naive, acute effector, memory, and exhausted T cell states ( Pauken et al., 2016; Sen et al., 2016 66. Pauken, K.E. ∙ Sammons, M.A. ∙ Odorizzi, P.M. ... Epigenetic stability of exhausted T cells limits durability of reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade Science. 2016; 354 :1160-1165 Crossref Scopus (893) PubMed Google Scholar 80. Sen, D.R. ∙ Kaminski, J. ∙ Barnitz, R.A. ... The epigenetic landscape of T cell exhaustion Science. 2016; 354 :1165-1169 Crossref Scopus (644) PubMed Google Scholar ). The responses we observe with antibody and PCZ combination in the animals are initially NK cell dependent. The initial response of tumors to our combination therapies is also dependent on the presence of monoclonal antibodies with target specificities for the tumor cell and on the presence of functional IgG1 heavy chain, and thus, an anti-tumor vaccine mechanism would likely be a secondary response contributing to tumor eradication.
Immune selection promoted by the anti-PD-L1 treatment may be possible, resulting in the emergence of tumor subclones devoid of MHC-I and therefore able to escape immune recognition. It may be that the combination therapy also stops MHC-I downregulation, and elucidation of this issue requires further analysis of tumors during regression. In non-responding tumors, PD-1 and PD-L1 protein expression is also downregulated. The inhibition of endocytosis by PCZ increases ADCC, but data using dynamin K44A as an endocytosis inhibitor suggest that there are secondary immune effects probably related to enhanced tumor-antigen presentation, leading to increased immune response. This may include MHC-I and MHC-II localization changes, but due to complete tumor clearance, this could not be analyzed.
The murine dose of PCZ at which we observe translocation of receptors to the surface of tumor cells is similar to that used to inhibit endocytosis and entry of viruses such as Dengue and Ebola, causing a lower mortality rate following infection in murine models ( Madrid et al., 2015; Simanjuntak et al., 2015 50. Madrid, P.B. ∙ Panchal, R.G. ∙ Warren, T.K. ... Evaluation of Ebola Virus Inhibitors for Drug Repurposing ACS Infect. Dis. 2015; 1 :317-326 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar 83.

This raises the possibility of using PCZ as a “frontline” medicine to reduce infections by highly pathogenic viruses. While dynamin inhibition has been postulated to have potential clinical efficacy in multiple diseases, application has been delayed as the D. melanogaster shibire mutant causes coma at the permissive temperature of this mutant ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz, 1991 90. van der Bliek, A.M. ∙ Meyerowitz, E.M. Dynamin-like protein encoded by the Drosophila shibire gene associated with vesicular traffic Nature. 1991; 351 :411-414 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that endocytosis inhibitors with appropriate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may be trialed in epilepsy and chronic kidney disease as suggested by pre-clinical studies ( Li et al., 2015; Schiffer et al., 2015 48. Li, Y.Y. ∙ Chen, X.N. ∙ Fan, X.X. ... Upregulated dynamin 1 in an acute seizure model and in epileptic patients Synapse. 2015; 69 :67-77 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar 74.

Med. 2015; 21 :601-609 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we propose them as adjuvants for selected cancer therapies. Further clinical trials will define the therapeutic value of combining cytotoxic mAbs, with drugs stabilizing membrane receptor expression in cancer treatment more broadly.

KJD cells, derived from transformed human epidermal keratinocytes and A431 cells, derived from a vulval SCC have been used for this study. A431, HCC1569, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SCC25, SKBR3, T47D, RENCA and CT26.WT cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). COLO16 and transformed KJD cells ( Cameron et al., 2010 9. Cameron, S.R. ∙ Dahler, A.L. ∙ Endo-Munoz, L.B. ... Tumor-initiating activity and tumor morphology of HNSCC is modulated by interactions between clonal variants within the tumor Lab. Invest. 2010; 90 :1594-1603 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ) were obtained from N. Saunders. Cell line identities were verified by SNP analysis. A431, COLO-16, SCC25 and KJD cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM-F12) (Life Technologies, GIBCO). T47D, RENCA and CT26.WT cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Life Technologies, GIBCO). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, GIBCO). SKBR3 cells were maintained in McCoy’s5a medium (Life Technologies, GIBCO). All culture media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM of L-Glutamine (Life Technologies, GIBCO) and 10 mM of HEPES (Life Technologies, GIBCO). MCF7 culture medium was additionally supplemented with 0.01 mg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich). For basal conditions cells were grown for 3 h in complete media but without 10% FBS prior to experimental conditions. All cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 level and cultured until they reached ∼90% confluence, at which time they were passaged by trypsinizing with 1% Trypsin-EDTA (Life technologies, GIBCO). All cell lines were regularly tested for the lack of mycoplasma contamination.
All experimental mouse work was performed in accordance with the regulatory standards of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes (the Code). Animal procedures were approved by the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (approval number: UQDI/491/15/NHMRC/ARC). All mice were young adult females (6-8 weeks old). The gender does not influence the results and there are no gender related considerations. NSG (NSG; strain NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJl; Stock #005557; RRID:IMSR_JAX:005557) and NSG carrying the human HLA Class I-A2 variant (NOD.Cg- Mcph1 Tg(HLA-A2.1)1Enge Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ;Stock#009617; RRID:IMSR_JAX:009617) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. NSG mice were organized in three groups of 4 animals (NSG+A431 groups) and four groups of 3 animals (NSG+KJD groups). NSG-A2 mice were divided in six groups of 6 animals (NSG-A2+KJD). BALB/cArc albino ( A / A Tyrp1 b / Tyrp1 b Tyr c / Tyr c ), MHC haplotype ( H2K d ) and complement factor C5 normal (Cat #ARC:BC, RRID:IMSR_ARC:BC) were purchased from the Animal Resources Centre (ARC) in Western Australia. Ninety-six BALB/c mice were separated in six groups of 12 mice (CT26.WT groups) and six groups of 4 mice (RENCA groups). All mice were housed in the Translational Research Institute (TRI) animal facility and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Mice were housed in Tecniplast Greenline IVC caging on corn cob bedding. Nesting material and paper huts were provided for enrichment. Light cycle was 12 h. Temperature in facility ranges from 18-23°C and humidity 40%–60%. Mice had unlimited access to chlorinated water and ad lib feed. Health status was monitored daily.
An open label, uncontrolled, single center pilot clinical study (no therapeutic benefit) was conducted at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. This study was approved by both Metro South Health HREC (HREC/15/QPAH/48) on March 11, 2015, after which it was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and patients recruited with written informed consent. The pilot clinical study has been registered at ANZCTR and allocated the ACTRN:12619001051134. This pilot clinical study participants were both male and female.
The primary objective was to inhibit endocytosis and to begin to establish the safety of administering a single PCZ dose calculated to achieve a temporary endocytosis block without significant toxicity. Acute toxicity was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.0 and recording additional adverse events. Secondary objective was to determine efficacy of increased dose PCZ as a clinically usable endocytosis inhibitor as determined by receptor binding site and distribution studies in pre- and post-PCZ infusion biopsies.
Eligible patients had histopathological or cytopathological confirmation of SCC of head and neck mucosa and adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function. Other eligibility included being ≥ 18 years of age, and the presence of at least one target lesion which could be easily accessed and biopsied in the head and neck region without surgery. Patients could previously have received radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Patients must have provided informed consent and were able to commit to 4 h in the clinic and 24 h without driving and operating machinery.
Specific exclusions (See Protocol for full exclusion criteria, on request) : Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2, on drugs that cause long QTc, history of prolonged QTc interval or prolonged QTc interval on baseline ECG, systolic blood pressure less than 90mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure < 50 mmHg in two consecutive blood pressure readings within the 1 h prior to study drug administration, previous reaction to antipsychotic medications requiring medical intervention, pregnant, breast feeding or Parkinson’s disease.
Ethics approval (HREC/15/QPAH/48) enabled eligible patients to be enrolled within two weeks of signing informed consent. No premedication was required. PCZ was administered at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (Martin and Walpole, PK manuscript in preparation), delivered via intravenous infusion over 20 min. 4mm punch biopsies were taken 15 min prior to start of infusion and 2 h and 45 min post-PCZ infusion ‘start time’ OR 2 h and 15 min post-PCZ infusion ‘stop time’.
Antibodies used for immunofluorescence and western blot are cataloged in the antibodies section of the Key Resources Table.
For western blot analysis all primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 and all secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:4,000.
Humanized monoclonal antibodies against human EGFR (cetuximab; Merck KgA), human HER2 (trastuzumab; Roche Genentech), human PD-L1 (avelumab; Merck KGaA), human HER3 (lumretuzumab; Creative Biolabs, New York, USA) and human IGF-1R (dalotuzumab; Creative Biolabs, New York, USA) were used at a final concentration of 60 μg/mL. Secondary goat anti-human Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) was used to label humanized monoclonal antibodies. DAPI (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) was used at 50 mM.
ADCC assay: PCZ (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 15 μM. Dyngo4a (final, 30 μM), Pitstop2 (final signaling, 15 μM; final ADCC, 30 μM) and Pitstop2 Inactive (final, 30 μM) were provided by A. McCluskey and P. Robinson.
A431, KJD, T47D and MCF7 cells were seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates and incubated overnight to reach 80% confluence. Cells were incubated with 60 μg/mL cetuximab, lumretuzumab or dalotuzumab for 30mins or 4 h. 30 μM Dyngo4a or 15μM prochlorperazine was added at given time points as shown in figures. Cells were then washed three times in ice cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS for 20 min, followed by permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS (PBTX) for 10 min and blocking in 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS. Humanized monoclonal antibodies were labeled by incubation with a secondary antibody (goat anti-human IgG Alexa Fluor 647 , Life technologies) for one h, followed by blocking in 2% BSA/PBS (Sigma-Aldrich)/PBS and 30 min DAPI staining. The coverslips were mounted on slides using ProLong® Gold antifade mountant (Life Technologies). Images were acquired using a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal with a 63 × objective or confocal laser scanning Olympus FV3000 microscope (Olympus Life Science) with a 100x objective
Cells were seeded on coverslips and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min. Cells were washed with PBS three times and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100/PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with 20 mg/mL avelumab for 1 h at room temperature, then washed three times with 2% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 10 min. Cells were incubated with the secondary antibody, anti-human IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 555 (A-21422; Invitrogen) for 45 min. The coverslips were washed three times with 2% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 10 min and stained with DAPI for 5 min. They were washed again three times with PBS and quickly washed with water before mounting onto glass slides using ProLong® Gold antifade mountant (Life technologies, Invitrogen). Images were taken using the confocal laser scanning Olympus FV3000 microscope (Olympus Life Science) and analyzed using the open-source software Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 75. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40003) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For signaling analysis, cells were plated at a density of approximately 1 × 10 6 cells/ dish in a 10-cm tissue culture-treated dish. Cells were serum starved for three h before treatment with the following drugs: cetuximab (60 μg/mL), PCZ (15 μM), Dyngo4a (30 μM), Pitstop2 (15 μM). DMSO was used as a vehicle control. Cells were treated with drugs for 30 min prior to EGF stimulation with continuous drug treatment. EGFR was stimulated with 10 ng/mL of Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugated EGF (Life Technologies) for 5, 15 or 30 min. In the combination therapies, drugs were added sequentially; cells were treated with cetuximab for 5 min before adding endocytosis inhibitors. Cells were promptly washed with ice-cold PBS before snap-freezing with liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed with 1X cell lysis buffer (9803; Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with both proteases and phosphatases inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, Merck KGaA) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
For fluorescence analysis of EGF stimulation, A431 or KJD cells were seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates and incubated overnight to reach 80% confluent density before undergoing serum starvation for three h. Cells were then treated with PCZ (15 μM). DMSO was used as a vehicle control. For EGF stimulation, cells were incubated with 10 ng/mL of Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugated EGF (Life Technologies) with continuous drugs treatment for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were promptly washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 15 min. Three additional washes were performed before cells were counterstained with DAPI (50mM, Life Technologies, Invitrogen) for 10 min. The coverslips were mounted on slides in Prolong Gold (Life technologies). Images were acquired using a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal with a 63 × objective.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was conjugated to recombinant EGF (Life Technologies) or cetuximab using a Lightening-Link labeling kit (Expedeon) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Aliquots were stored at −20°C until use.
A431 cells were serum-starved for 3 h before treatment without (Control) or with PCZ (prochlorperazine, 15 μM) for 30min. Cells were then co-incubated with cetuximab-HRP (60 μg/mL) and 1x10 7 /mL PBMCs for 10mins at 37°C.
In the EGF-HRP uptake experiment cells were incubated with EGF-HRP (25 μg/mL) for 10 or 30 min at 37°C in the continued absence/presence of PCZ.
Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) in PBS for 30min at room temperature. They were then washed and incubated with 10 mg/mL 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.012% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 30min. Cells were contrasted with 1% osmium tetroxide (ProSciTech) for 2 min then serially dehydrated with increasing percentages of ethanol, embedded in LX-112 resin (Ladd Research) and polymerized overnight at 60°C. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica UC6 Ultramicrotome and were viewed without further staining to facilitate visualization of the DAB reaction product. Micrographs were acquired using a JEOL 1011 transmission electron microscope fitted with a Morada CCD camera (Olympus) under the control of iTEM software.
EGF uptake in mice tumor xenografts and patient biopsies was carried out as described in ( Joseph et al., 2019 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). For patient biopsies, a 4 mm punch biopsy was taken by a specialized surgical oncologist before (pre-infusion; Pre-PCZ) and 45 min after the end of PCZ infusion (post-infusion; Post-PCZ) from an accessible tumor. Live tumor uptake was carried out on mice or patient biopsy tumors as quickly as possible after excision (within 15 min) to ensure tumor cells were still metabolically active.
Single tumor fragments were subjected to various treatments; EGF uptake (2μg/mL of EGF-Alexa 488 (E-13345; Invitrogen) added to fresh DMEM) at 37°C for 30 min (EGF-30’); EGFR antibody uptake (sc120; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc; added to fresh DMEM) at 37°C for 60 min (EGFR uptake 60’) or DEAE-Dextran (10k)-Alexa Fluor 555 uptake (10 μg/mL DEAE-Dextran-Alexa555; Molecular Probes, ThermoFisher Scientific, Scoresby, Australia) at 37°C for 30 min (Dextran-30min) in rotating incubator. Multiple controls were performed as per Joseph et al. ( Joseph et al., 2019 37. Joseph, S.R. ∙ Gaffney, D.C. ∙ Barry, R. ... An Ex Vivo Human Tumor Assay Shows Distinct Patterns of EGFR Trafficking in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Correlating to Therapeutic Outcomes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tumor samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. The EGFR antibody uptake samples were incubated with goat anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody (A-11005; Invitrogen).
Some tumor samples underwent whole mount immunofluorescence (post-fixation labeling). For this purpose samples were incubated for 4 h in PBS containing 10% horse serum (blocking buffer; non-permeabilized) or PBTX (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 10% horse serum (blocking buffer; permeabilized) and then incubated with anti-EGFR antibody (sc120; 1:200), diluted in blocking buffer (with or without TX) overnight at 4°C. Following 5 × 20 min washes in PBS or PBTX, samples were incubated with goat anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody (A-11005; Invitrogen) or goat anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (A-11001, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then washed in PBS or PBTX.
All samples were stained with 50 mM DAPI (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and mounted using ProLong® Gold antifade mountant (Invitrogen) on concave microscope slides. Images acquired using a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope with a 63x objective and Zen 2008 software (Carl Zeiss, Germany).
1 × 10 6 cells were plated on a 10-cm dish and transfected with 10 μg of either pEGFPN1 (empty GFP vector) as mock control or pEGFPN1-human Dynamin 1aa K44A (K44A-GFP dynamin mutant plasmid). K44A dynamin mutant blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis as described in ( Damke et al., 1994 17. Damke, H. ∙ Baba, T. ∙ Warnock, D.E. ... Induction of mutant dynamin specifically blocks endocytic coated vesicle formation J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127 :915-934 Crossref Scopus (1064) PubMed Google Scholar ). pEGFPN1-human Dynamin 1aa K44A was a gift from Pietro De Camilli (Addgene plasmid #22197) ( Lee and De Camilli, 2002 46. Lee, E. ∙ De Camilli, P. Dynamin at actin tails Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :161-166 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transfection was done using Lipofectamine 2000 following manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were transfected overnight before using immediately the following day for ADCC as described before.
Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocol, and samples were then supplemented with 5x loading buffer. 10 μg of protein samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) electrophoretically. Membranes were blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. All primary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA in TBS-T at a dilution of 1:1,000. All membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C with shaking. Membranes were washed 3x in TBS-T before incubating with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. All secondary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA in TBS-T at a dilution of 1:4,000. Membranes were washed 3x 5 min with TBS-T before visualizing using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) on ChemiDoc XRS+ (Bio-Rad), The relative expression of specific protein was determined following quantification of scanned images by using ImageLab program (Bio-Rad), normalized to β-Tubulin/ GAPDH first before normalizing to DMSO 0 as control. The values were then normalized to highest value in order to obtain the same y axis range. All immunoblot images were processed in an identical way.
Protein concentration from whole-cell lysates were determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Arrays used were the PathScan RTK Signaling Antibody Array kit (#7982; Cell Signaling Technology) and PathScan Akt Signaling Antibody Array kit (#9474; Cell Signaling Technology). Samples were diluted to 1 mg/mL with diluent buffer that was provided by the manufacturer. HRP-linked streptavidin was used to detect bound proteins, which were then visualized using LumiGLO Reagent on ChemiDoc XRS+ (Bio-Rad). The relative expression of specific protein was determined following quantification of scanned images by using Fiji program.
The F(ab′) 2 fragments were made using the F(ab′) 2 Fragmentation Kit (G-Biosciences). Immobilized pepsin resin (0.5-0.6mL) was transferred to a spin column, washed with 0.5-2 mL of digestion buffer (20mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5) and centrifuged at 3,000xg for 1 min at 4°C for four times. Resin was resuspended in 2-6 mL of digestion buffer. SpinOUT column was equilibrated with 1 mL of digestion buffer and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 2 min at 4°C five times. In a new collection tube, 0.5 ml-1 mL of avelumab (20 mg/mL) was slowly applied to the SpinOUT resin. The column was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 2 min at 4°C to collect the IgG solution, which was then added to the immobilized pepsin and incubated at 37°C in continuous agitation for 6-8 h. Avelumab was digested by pepsin to preserve disulfide bonds and yield a divalent molecule containing two antibody binding sites. The light chains remain intact and attached to the heavy chain, whereas the Fc fragment is digested into small peptides. After that, the columns were centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 1 min to collect the digested antibody. Solution containing the digested antibody was dialyzed in 4-5 L of 1X PBS using the 3,500 MWCO SnakeSkin dialysis tubing (ThermoFisher Scientific) overnight in the cold room. A final concentration of 5-10 mg/mL of F(ab′) 2 fragments was obtained using Amicon Ultra15 30KDa and 50KDa cutoff filters (Merck Millipore) and measured at A280nm by Nanodrop (ND-1000 Spectrophotometer – ThermoFisher Scientific). F(ab′) 2 fragments were filtered and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel under reducing and non-reducing conditions ( Figure S7 F) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The binding activity of the generated F(ab′) 2 fragments was assessed by immunofluorescence for both cell lines. F(ab′) 2 preparations were stored at −80°C. Avelumab integrity was also analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE ( Figure S7 G). Avelumab stock (20 mg/mL) from a previously opened vial used on the experiments and stored under appropriate conditions, and from a new unopened vial were assessed. Working solution (avelumab 4 mg/mL diluted with 1X PBS) was prepared from both avelumab stock 20mg/mL (previously opened vial versus new unopened vial) and also assessed. Gels were analyzed using ODYSSEY CLx and Image Studio v5.2 software (Li-COR).
PBMCs were separated from fresh heparinized whole blood of healthy donors with their consent and ethics approval (UQ#2012000605; UQ#2019000122/HREC/2018/QMS/44046). Briefly whole blood was collected from healthy human donors and diluted by half with 2% FBS/PBS (Life Technologies, GIBCO). The blood was then layered onto 15 mL Lymphoprep (StemCell Technologies, Inc.) gradients. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 800xg for 20 min in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (StemCell Technologies, Inc.). The PBMC interface was isolated and washed in 40 mL of 2% FBS/PBS (Life Technologies, GIBCO) by centrifugation at 550xg for 15 min. The supernatants were discarded and PBMCs were resuspended into RPMI 1640 media (Life Technologies, GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM L-glutamine.
Flow cytometry was performed on triplicate tubes per treatment. 2.0x10 4 target cells (Target, T; A431, KJD, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF7, HCC1569 or T47D), were harvested and labeled with 0.5 μM CFSE (Life technologies) for 10 min, followed by washing to remove excess dye. The CFSE labeled target cells were then plated at a concentration of 20,000 cells per tube and incubated with 60 μg/mL cetuximab, dalotuzumab, lumretuzumab or avelumab and 1.0x10 6 fresh PBMCs (Effector: E) at an E/T = 50/1 for 4 h. Different dynamin inhibitors were added at given time points as shown in figures. After the incubation, 5 μl of aminoactinomycin-D (7-AAD; BD PharMingen) was added into each tube to label dead cells. For dalotuzumab and lumretuzumab experiments, Tag-it-violet (Biolegend) was used in place of CFSE and FVS700 (BDBiosciences) in place of 7-AAD. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto). The percentage of specific target cell death was calculated using the following formula: = % S ⁢ p ⁢ e ⁢ c ⁢ i ⁢ f ⁢ i ⁢ c C ⁢ e ⁢ l ⁢ l D ⁢ e ⁢ a ⁢ t ⁢ h ⁡ [ % 7 − A ⁢ A ⁢ D + ⁢ C ⁢ F ⁢ S ⁢ E + ⁡ ( d ⁢ e ⁢ a ⁢ d ) ⁢ t ⁢ a ⁢ r ⁢ g ⁢ e ⁢ t ⁢ s ] − [ % s ⁢ p ⁢ o ⁢ n ⁢ t ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ e ⁢ o ⁢ u ⁢ s 7 − A ⁢ A ⁢ D + ⁢ C ⁢ F ⁢ S ⁢ E + ⁡ ( d ⁢ e ⁢ a ⁢ d ) ⁢ t ⁢ a ⁢ r ⁢ g ⁢ e ⁢ t ⁢ s ] 𝟏 𝟎 𝟎 − [ % S ⁢ p ⁢ o ⁢ n ⁢ t ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ e ⁢ o ⁢ u ⁢ s ⁢ 7 − A ⁢ A ⁢ D + ⁢ C ⁢ F ⁢ S ⁢ E + ⁡ ( d ⁢ e ⁢ a ⁢ d ) ⁢ t ⁢ a ⁢ r ⁢ g ⁢ e ⁢ t ⁢ s ] × 𝟏 𝟎 𝟎 % Three control conditions were used for each experiment: 1) unstained control, 2) 7AAD (BD Biosciences, BD PharMingen; Franklin Lakes, USA) only control, 3) CFSE (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) only control, in addition to multiple experimental test conditions as described above, 4) CFSE stained target cells with/without drug and with/without PBMCs.
The effect of drugs on cell proliferation was measured using the CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Wisconsin, USA). A431/ KJD cells (1,000, 2,500 or 5,000 cells per well) or MDA-MB-468/ MDA-MB-231/ SKBR3 (5,000 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well flat bottom plates and allowed to settle down for 2 h. The target cells were then incubated with or without cetuximab (60 μg/mL) at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for different time points as shown in Figure S1 A. After specified time the incubation was stopped with the addition of 20 μl MTS reagent per well and incubated for a further 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . The optical density (OD value) was read at 490nm by a microplate spectrophotometer. The percentage of cell viability was indicated by comparison of cetuximab-treated versus untreated cells.
1x10 6 cells were added to each polyester FACS tube. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in 100 μL of respective media. Following this, Dyngo4a and Pitstop2 (30 μM) were added to specified conditions and incubated 37°C for 1 h. All cells were placed on ice before being washed thrice by centrifugation at 1000RPM for 5 min with ice cold FACS buffer, then resuspended into 100 μL of FACS Buffer. Anti-human Alexa Fluor 647 was then added at 2 μg/mL were added to appropriate tubes on ice for 30-min. Following this, cells were washed as previously described, again three times. Cell fixation was conducted using 4% PFA (Sigma-Aldridge) for 20 min at room temperature. PFA was removed and cells were resuspended into 1 mL of FACS Buffer. Analysis of cells occurred using Flow Cytometry BD LSRII. Measurements of geometric mean were used to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity of cell populations using FloJo 10.0.7 software.
The avidin/biotin assay was performed as described in ( Simpson et al., 1999 84. Simpson, F. ∙ Hussain, N.K. ∙ Qualmann, B. ... SH3-domain-containing proteins function at distinct steps in clathrin-coated vesicle formation Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1 :119-124 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ) for A431 and KJD cells.
Quantification of total human EGFR and HER2 levels in A431, KJD and MCF7 whole cell lysates was conducted using the Calbiochem Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) ELISA Kit (Merck, Millipore) and The Human HER2 (Total) ELISA Kit (Life Technologies, Invitrogen), respectively, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
This study arose from our observation that patient tumor samples in which EGFR endocytosis was defective showed 100% correlation with tumor regression in response to monoclonal antibody therapy. We therefore hypothesized that blocking endocytosis in some way enhanced patient responses to therapy. Our study was designed to assess parameters that may be mechanistically responsible for this observation. The constant improvement was found to be associated with the presence of active NK cells and the IgG1 Heavy chain of the antibody. We used ADCC assays and FACs analysis. All biochemical and cellular experiments were repeated with minimum of three biological replicates. Each biological replicate included technical replicates. Data was subjected to statistical analysis as described in Table S1 . Fresh human PBMC were collected with written donor consent with ethics approval from Metro South Health HREC and from The University of Queensland HREC. All experiments were conducted in adherence to the Singapore Statement on Research Integrity and the Declaration of Helsinki.
The in vivo models were chosen as NSG and NSG-A2 can be populated with human immune cells. Cetuximab does not bind to mouse EGFR. As our in vitro data suggested dynamin inhibition improves ADCC we required a functional immune system. The 7A7 anti-mouse EGFR IgG1 antibody which we purchased to test a syngeneic mouse model does not work and we have published our data on its defects ( He et al., 2018 30. He, X. ∙ Cruz, J.L. ∙ Joseph, S. ... Characterization of 7A7, an anti-mouse EGFR monoclonal antibody proposed to be the mouse equivalent of cetuximab Oncotarget. 2018; 9 :12250-12260 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Experiments were powered such that if tumor growth demonstrated a 20% change over control, assuming an alpha of 5% (95% Confidence Interval) then 6 mice per group give a statistical power of 90%. The 20% change was conservative given our results.
Severely immune deficient NSG and NSG-HLA-A2.1 mice were used as recipients of human immune cells (PBMCs or NK cells). 1x10 6 A431 or KJD SCC cells (200 μl, PBS) were subcutaneously injected in the back under anesthesia and aseptic conditions. Once A431 or KJD tumors reached a diameter of 0.5cm-0.8cm, mice were intravenously administered immune cells to the required group. PBMCs were purified as described above, while NK cells were isolated using a MoFlo Astrios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) as per manufacturers’ instructions. Interleukin-15/interleukin-15 receptor alpha complex (IL-15/IL-15Rα complex) was used for the NK cell expansion (expanded cell population confirmed by FACS as CD3 - CD56 + cells) and activation in vivo at a dose of 1.25 μg/mouse injected intraperitoneally. NSG mice received either 1x10 6 purified human Natural Killer (NKs) or 1x10 7 isolated human PBMCs intravenously (i.v.). Similarly, NSG.A2 mice received 1x10 7 of HLA.A2 matched isolated human PBMCs (i.v.). To specifically inhibit the intracellular signaling but not the ADCC response to cetuximab, Fc deficient cetuximab (F(ab′) 2 ) was prepared using the F(ab) 2 Fragmentation Kit (G-Biosciences) following the manufacturers’ instructions. This consists of a controlled enzymatic digestion of cetuximab that doesn’t lead to dissociation of the bivalent F(ab′) 2 into monovalent Fab moieties. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with either 500 μg/mouse of cetuximab (Cmab, Merck Serono) or 500 μg/mouse F(ab′) 2 twice a week for three consecutive weeks (i.v.). When indicated, animals were injected i.v. or i.p with 0.8-1 mg/kg body weight/mouse (as per figure legend) of the dynamin inhibitor prochlorperazine dimaleate (PCZ, Sigma Aldrich), 24 to 48 h after cetuximab injection. Cetuximab and PCZ were thereafter administered twice a week for 3 weeks when corresponding. Tumor growth was monitored twice a week by measuring its diameter with a caliper (Vernier, Silverline Digital) and animal health and body weight were recoded until the end of the experiment. All drugs were then administrated via intravenous and intraperitoneal routes with a total volume that did not exceed 150 μl.
Histologic processing of excised tumors, organs and other tissues were performed in the Histology Core Facility, Translational Research Institute. Excised tissues were fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich) and kept at 4°C for 48 to 72 h for proper fixation. Thereafter, tissues were transferred to PBS and sectioned for further hematoxylin and eosin staining. Sections were scanned and imaged using Olympus Slide scanner VS120, and results were analyzed using Olivia-software.
BALB/c mice were anesthetized under 4% isoflurane and injected subcutaneously with 100,000 cells (in 100 μL) using an insulin syringe. Seventy two animals separated in six groups of 12 mice were challenged with CT26.WT cells and twenty-four mice organized in six groups of 4 animals were injected with RENCA cells and treated as described in therapy schedule below. All mice were monitored until they fully recovered from the anesthesia. Mice were weighed and tumors measured three times weekly. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula below: T u m o r V o l u m e = ( 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ 𝑥 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ 2 ) 2
Treatments started when tumors were approximately 0.1 cm 3 (day 15 for CT26.WT groups and day 19 for RENCA groups). All treatments were delivered by tail vein injection on the specific days indicated by black and gray triangles on the Figure 6 (CT26.WT) and Figure S5 (RENCA).
PCZ therapy: PCZ (Sigma-Aldrich) was weighed and dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). Prior to injection, a stock solution of PCZ (1 mg/mL) was prepared using PBS in the biological safety cabinet. Mice in the PCZ, F(ab′) 2 + PCZ, and avelumab+PCZ groups received PCZ at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/Kg. Considering that the weight among the animals was variable ( Figure 6 I and Figure S5 I), two dilutions were made based on mice whose body weights were 17 g (0.136 mg/mL PCZ) and 21 g (0.168 mg/mL PCZ). Animals weighing below and above 19 g received 0.0136 mg (100 μL of 0.136 mg/mL PCZ) and 0.0168 mg (100 μL of 0.136 mg/mL PCZ) of PCZ, respectively. In the avelumab+PCZ and F(ab′) 2 +PCZ groups, PCZ was administered 1 h after the avelumab and F(ab′) 2 injections. PCZ only was administered to the CT26.WT-PCZ group on days 15, 17, 20, 23, 30, 34, and 37, and to the RENCA-PCZ group on days 19, 22, 26, 29, 33, 36, and 40.
F(ab′) 2 fragment therapy: 680 μg of F(ab′) 2 fragments were given to the CT26.WT-F(ab′) 2 and RENCA - F(ab′) 2 groups on days 15, 17, 20, 23, and 19, 22, 26, respectively. F(ab′) 2 fragments plus PCZ combination was given to the CT26.WT- F(ab′) 2 +PCZ group on days 15, 17, 20, and 23, and to the RENCA-F(ab′) 2 +PCZ group on days 19, 22, and 26.
Avelumab therapy: avelumab working solution (4 mg/mL) was prepared prior to injections in the biological safety cabinet by diluting 20 mg/m L avelumab stock in 1X PBS (Life Technologies, GIBCO). Mice in the avelumab and avelumab + PCZ groups received 100 μL of 4 mg/mL avelumab (400 μg). Avelumab only was administered to the CT26.WT-Avelumab group on days 15, 17, 20, 23, and 30, and to the RENCA-Avelumab group on days 19, 22, 26, and 29. In the CT26.WT-Avelumab+PCZ group, animals received avelumab plus PCZ on days 15, 17, 20, 23, and 30, followed by administration of PCZ only on days 34 and 37. In the RENCA - Avelumab+PCZ group, avelumab plus PCZ combination was administered on days 19, 22, 26, and 29, followed by PCZ only on days 33, 36, and 40. A summary of the therapy schedule is described below. Mice were monitored after the injections for any adverse events.

BALB/c mice that showed complete tumor regression in the groups treated with F(ab′) 2 fragments (n = 1), avelumab (n = 1), and avelumab+PCZ (n = 3) were reinjected subcutaneously with 100,000 CT26.WT cells. Two mice which had not developed tumors in response to RENCA tumor cell injection (CT26.WT naive mice) were used as the control and injected subcutaneously with 100,000 CT26.WT cells. Mice were weighed and tumors measured three times weekly. Tumor volume was calculated according to the formula above. Animals were euthanized when tumors were approximately 1.0 cm 3 .
Three CT26.WT tumor-bearing mice from each experimental group were euthanized 2 and 7 days after the first treatment. The remaining mice were euthanized at the end point, when tumors were ≥ 1.0cm 3 or showed ulceration. Samples of blood, spleen, lymph nodes and tumor were collected at every time point. Blood samples were collected from RENCA tumor-bearing mice every week after the first treatment. They were euthanized only at the end point and tissue was also collected. Blood baseline was taken from all mice in the experimental groups.
Erythrocytes were directly eliminated from blood with ACK lysis buffer (0.15M NH 4 Cl, 1mM KHCO 3 , 0.1mM EDTA). Tumors were harvested and weight of each tumor was recorded. Then tumors were finely chopped and incubated at 37°C for 60 min in digestion media (RPMI media, 2% FBS, 3 mg/mL collagenase D and 5 ug/mL DNase I). Single cell suspension from digested tumors, spleens and lymph nodes was obtained by passing the sample through a 70 μm nylon strainer (Corning) and erythrocytes from the spleen were eliminated with ACK Lysis buffer. Samples were washed and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS (GIBCO). Half of the spleen samples and a quarter of the tumor samples were used for the staining. Prior antibody staining of mouse FC receptors were blocked using TruStain FCX (BioLegend, San Diego, California) at 1:200 dilution in PBS (GIBCO) for 10 min. Staining of surface markers was performed using the combinations of fluorescently-labeled monoclonal antibodies described in the Key Resources Table diluted in PBS and incubating for 30 min to 1 h on ice in the dark. For Foxp3 intracellular staining “Foxp3 Staining Buffer set kit” (eBioscience) was used following the manufacturers’ recommendations. Before analysis, samples were washed twice with permeabilization buffer and once with PBS. All samples were resuspended in 200 μl PBS prior analysis and 10 μl Beckman Coulter count beads were added for absolute number quantification. Flow cytometry was performed using BD LSR Fortessa X20 (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA) and the results were analyzed using the BD FACSDivaTM and FlowJo software. The gating strategy for the immunological analysis can be visualized in Methods S1 .
For FACS experiments statistical analysis of relative percentage of cell death was conducted using PRISM software (version 7.0a). Relative expression values for control and treated samples were tested for statistical differences by conducting an ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with equal SD for analysis with more than two groups for multiple comparisons to a control group. An unpaired two-tailed t test with equal SD was performed for analysis with two groups.
For Figures 1 C, 1D, and 5 A each n value (n = 3 or n = 4) represents specific measurements of cell death per treatment condition per independent experiment. Bars indicate mean and error bars depict SEM. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
For NSG animal experiments, statistical analysis of tumor size (fold change) was conducted using PRISM software (version 7.0a). Relative tumor size for control and treated groups were tested for statistical differences by conducting an ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with equal SD for analysis with more than two groups for multiple comparisons to a control group. A non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was performed for analysis with two groups. For Figures 5 B–5D each n value (n = 3 to n = 6) represents individual tumor size fold related to day 0 of treatment, per treatment condition per independent experiment. Bars indicate mean and error bars depict standard deviation. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01.
For BALB/c mice experiment, different treatment arms ( Figures 6 A–6F and S5 A–S5F), absolute values of tumor volume were plotted (CT26.WT groups n = 6; RENCA groups n = 4). Combined graphs ( Figures 6 G and S5 G) show data as mean of all live animals ± SEM for each group.
Analysis of CT26.WT tumors (fold change) in response to avelumab versus avelumab + PCZ therapy was performed by one-way ANOVA analysis at Day 49 post-tumor challenge ( Figures 6 J and 6K). Analysis was based on the mean of 6 mice per group at Day 49 post tumor challenge ± SEM. Mean of each column was compared with the mean of every other column. P values were determined using one-way ANOVA analysis, followed by Fisher’s LSD test for multiple comparisons ( ∗∗ p < 0.01). Data shown is the result of a single experiment. Analysis of tumor rechallenge ( Figures 6 L and 6M) was performed with mice that showed tumor regression in the groups treated with F(ab′) 2 fragments (n = 1), avelumab (n = 1), and avelumab + PCZ (n = 3). Data were analyzed as control (naive mice, n = 2) versus rechallenged mice (n = 5). Significance was determined by Mantel-Cox test, followed by Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test ( ∗∗ p < 0.01). CT26.WT tumor-bearing mice sacrificed for immunological analysis were not included in the tumor growth, survival, and tumor regression analysis. Full statistics described in Table S1 .
