Title: A Global Map of G Protein Signaling Regulation by RGS Proteins


Abstract: Summary

The control over the extent and timing of G protein signaling is provided by the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins that deactivate G protein α subunits (Gα). Mammalian genomes encode 20 canonical RGS and 16 Gα genes with key roles in physiology and disease. To understand the principles governing the selectivity of Gα regulation by RGS, we examine the catalytic activity of all canonical human RGS proteins and their selectivity for a complete set of Gα substrates using real-time kinetic measurements in living cells. The data reveal rules governing RGS-Gα recognition, the structural basis of its selectivity, and provide principles for engineering RGS proteins with defined selectivity. The study also explores the evolution of RGS-Gα selectivity through ancestral reconstruction and demonstrates how naturally occurring non-synonymous variants in RGS alter signaling. These results provide a blueprint for decoding signaling selectivity and advance our understanding of molecular recognition principles.

Section: Introduction

Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce a vast variety of extracellular stimuli, including hormones, ions, organic molecules, and light into the regulation of intracellular “effectors” to generate cellular responses ( Neves et al., 2002 78. Neves, S.R. ∙ Ram, P.T. ∙ Iyengar, R. G protein pathways Science. 2002; 296 :1636-1639 Crossref Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, G protein systems play a role in nearly every physiological process and in numerous pathologies ( Heng et al., 2013 38. Heng, B.C. ∙ Aubel, D. ∙ Fussenegger, M.

G proteins are activated by the binding of GTP to the α subunits (Gα) that release them from inhibitory occlusion by the βγ dimer (Gβγ) ( Glukhova et al., 2018 31.

Regulation, Signaling, and Physiological Functions of G-Proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 :3850-3868 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mammalian genomes encode a conserved set of 16 Gα subunits, each possessing unique signaling properties and the ability to selectively engage a distinct set of effectors, including adenylate cyclases, phospholipase C isozymes, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and ion channels ( Hubbard and Hepler, 2006 46.

The key determinant of G protein action in cells is their lifetime in an active state. Thus, the activation and deactivation of G proteins is tightly controlled and ought to occur with selectivity for individual G proteins to ensure the selectivity of downstream signaling ( Siderovski and Willard, 2005 101.

Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 :1159-1204 Crossref Scopus (689) PubMed Google Scholar ). Deciphering molecular mechanisms of this selectivity is of paramount importance for understanding how the signals are routed in the cells. A number of G protein activators have been described and demonstrated to act as GEFs on the Gα subunits with clear subtype selectivity ( Cismowski et al., 1999 15.

Among them, the largest class is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family ( Fredriksson et al., 2003 26. Fredriksson, R. ∙ Lagerström, M.C. ∙ Lundin, L.G. ...

Mechanistic insights into GPCR-G protein interactions Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 41 :247-254 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). GPCRs exhibit clear preferences for activating particular Gα species, and there has been tremendous progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms in establishing this selectivity ( Flock et al., 2017 25.

The opposing process of G protein deactivation occurs when G proteins hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP), a process assisted by the action of the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The GAP action is essential for avoiding response saturation and for achieving temporal resolution dictated by individual physiological reactions ( Ross, 2008 92. Ross, E.M. Coordinating speed and amplitude in G-protein signaling Curr. Biol. 2008; 18 :R777-R783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most well-characterized GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins belong to the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family, consisting of 20 canonical members in mammals ( Dohlman and Thorner, 1997 18.

RGS proteins bind to active Gα proteins and facilitate their GTPase activity, thereby accelerating the termination of G protein signaling ( Berman et al., 1996b 11.

It is now well established that this action of RGS proteins is crucial for achieving the physiologically relevant timing and extent of GPCR signaling ( Hollinger and Hepler, 2002 42.

Although these studies provide insights into the selectivity of RGS action for isolated cases, a comprehensive understanding of the complete landscape of Gα preferences of RGS proteins is still lacking.
This study presents a map of Gα selectivity for all canonical RGS proteins. We monitored the temporal regulation of GPCR-mediated G protein signaling and quantitatively characterized the GAP activity of the RGS proteins, testing nearly all of the theoretically possible Gα-RGS pairings (300 combinations). Using the functional activity as a readout in the context of a physiologically relevant cellular environment allowed us ot document the preferences of RGS proteins for Gα substrates, revealing pairings and disallowed combinations. This information led to the identification of molecular determinants involved in the selectivity of Gα-RGS recognition. Applying computational algorithms, we also show how these determinants have evolved and can be used to create designer RGS proteins with novel selectivity profiles. Analysis of human genomic data further suggests that genetic variations in RGS selectivity determinants may contribute to non-disease traits, pathological dysregulation of GPCR signaling, and variable responsiveness to drug treatments.

Section: Results

To test their possible RGS-Gα coupling systematically, we used a cell-based system that provides a cellular environment to study the action of RGS in the context of GPCR signaling. This assay monitors RGS-induced acceleration of G protein deactivation by real-time bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) strategy tracking the kinetics of heterotrimer re-association upon antagonizing GPCR, a reaction catalyzed by RGS proteins physiologically ( Figure 1 A). The key features of the assay include a “bystander” approach that allows the use of unmodified Gα subunits ( Figure 1 B) and full-length RGS proteins ( Figure 1 C).
Using a set of GPCRs with varying Gα selectivity, we recorded the deactivation kinetics of 15 Gα subunits (omitting sensory Gα t1 , Gα t2 , and Gα gust , but including the two common splice variants of Gα s and Gα o ) in the absence of exogenous RGS proteins. A combination of intrinsic differences in Gα properties and the action of endogenous RGS proteins in HEK293T/17 cells yielded characteristic baseline deactivation rates ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Using a previously established approach ( Masuho et al., 2013 70. Masuho, I. ∙ Xie, K. ∙ Martemyanov, K.A. Macromolecular composition dictates receptor and G protein selectivity of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) 7 and 9-2 protein complexes in living cells J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :25129-25142 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), we ensured that the deactivation kinetics were rate limited by the Gα GTPase activity.

USA. 1997; 94 :12851-12856 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Srinivasa et al., 1998 107. Srinivasa, S.P. ∙ Watson, N. ∙ Overton, M.C. ...

Chem. 1998; 273 :1529-1533 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) substantially prolonged response recovery ( Figure S1 ). These mutations interfere with the conserved interaction of RGS proteins with the switch I region of the Gα subunits. Further controls demonstrated that (1) the exogenous expression of RGS proteins does not alter the expression of signaling molecules and sensors ( Figures S2 A and S2B), (2) the different expression levels of GPCRs or the different amounts of active G proteins do not change the G protein deactivation rates ( Figure S2 C), and (3) deactivation rates are directly proportional to the amount of RGS ( Figure S2 D). These results confirm that RGS action dictates the kinetics of G protein deactivation. Analysis of the deactivation traces for a representative Gα (Gα oA ) shows the varying impact of different exogenous RGS proteins on the kinetics of Gα termination ( Figures 1 F and 1G).
To quantify the activity of RGS proteins, the baseline deactivation rates (1/τ) of each Gα were subtracted from the deactivation rates in the presence of exogenous RGS proteins, yielding the k GAP parameter ( Figure 1 H), a widely used metric of RGS catalytic activity ( Ross, 2002 91. Ross, E.M. Quantitative assays for GTPase-activating proteins Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344 :601-617 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plotting k GAP values for each of the Gα substrates provides a profile of relative activity for a given RGS protein. Analysis of the representative members of the RGS subfamilies using this strategy revealed differences in Gα preferences in a fingerprint-like fashion ( Figure 1 I). These Gα selectivity fingerprints were not affected by differences in the RGS expression levels ( Figure S3 A–S3D).
This strategy was applied to measure the activity of all 20 canonical RGS proteins on the deactivation of each of 15 Gα subunits in a total of 300 possible combinations. We optimized RGS expression levels, ensuring at least 3-fold acceleration of the deactivation rate for the preferred Gα substrate to reliably assess even minor coupling. Ιn particularly difficult cases (e.g., RGS13, RGS18), proteasomal blockade and codon optimization strategies were applied to augment RGS expression ( Figures S3 E–S3K). Given the differences in the expression levels of various RGS proteins, we did not attempt to compare their absolute activities and instead focused on elucidating the relative differences in G protein preferences. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive Gα selectivity profile for the entire RGS family ( Figures 1 J and S4 ; Table S1 ).
Analysis of the RGS-Gα interaction network provided several key insights. We found that RGS proteins vary markedly in the breadth of their selectivity, with some members (e.g., RGS1) regulating all G i/o - and G q -type proteins, whereas others (e.g., RGS11) regulated only one Gα type, Gα o ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S5 A–S5C). The R4 and RZ subfamilies regulated the broadest range of Gα substrates ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S5 A–S5C). Collectively, R4 and RZ members regulated all Gα q and Gα i/o types with a spectrum of biases ( Figures 1 J, 2 A, and S4 ). For example, RGS3 and RGS4 preferred the Gα i/o over the Gα q , whereas RGS5 and RGS13 selected Gα q over Gα i/o . No RGS protein was shown to be specific for the Gα q subfamily. The narrowest selectivity was observed for the R7 subfamily, the members of which regulated Gα i/o proteins exclusively (but not Gα z ) with prominent selectivity for Gα o .
This analysis revealed that Gα subunits vary substantially in their sensitivity to RGS regulation ( Figures 2 C and S5 E). For example, we found Gα o to be the most indiscriminate Gα in that it was regulated by all of the canonical RGS proteins, whereas Gα z could be deactivated only by a limited number of RGS proteins ( Figures 2 C, S5 D, and S5F). We also noticed that a relatively slow rate (0.0021 ± 0.0003 s −1 ) of basal GTPase activity of Gα z possibly underestimated the selectivity of its regulation by RGS proteins when assessed by the k GAP parameter ( Figures S5 G–S5I). Accordingly, we calculated a discrimination index ( k dis ) defined by fold increase in the deactivation constant (1/τ) upon the addition of RGS ( Figure S5 J). Although considering that k dis did not change the overall picture of G protein selectivity for most RGS members, it was useful in showing the unique ability of RZ subfamily members to uniquely regulate Gα z ( Figures S5 K and S5L) amidst their significant activity on virtually all of the other Gα i/o and Gα q proteins based on the k GAP .
These data also revealed high selectivity in the regulation of the poorly studied Gα 15 . This G protein is activated by a wide range of GPCRs and thus likely contributes to a variety of cellular responses ( Offermanns and Simon, 1995 82. Offermanns, S. ∙ Simon, M.I. G alpha 15 and G alpha 16 couple a wide variety of receptors to phospholipase C J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 :15175-15180 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that it has a very slow intrinsic deactivation rate (0.0081 ± 0.0006 s −1 ), making RGS regulation paramount for the temporal control of its signaling. Interestingly, Gα 15 can be deactivated by only a few RGS proteins ( Figure S5 D), mostly Gα q -type-preferring R4 members and an RZ subfamily member, RGS17 ( Figures 2 C and S5 F).
These studies further revealed that no canonical RGS proteins could regulate the deactivation of Gα s , Gα olf , Gα 12 , or Gα 13 ( Figure 1 J). This outcome is perhaps not unexpected. Structural modeling shows that the switch I region of Gα 12/13 contains Lys-204 instead of a Thr present in all of the other Gα subfamilies in the corresponding position, rendering it incompatible with RGS binding ( Figures S5 M and S5N). Furthermore, the structure of the αB–C loop in the α-helical domain is also fundamentally different in Gα 12/13 , contributing to the steric occlusion of canonical RGS protein binding ( Sprang et al., 2007 105. Sprang, S.R. ∙ Chen, Z. ∙ Du, X. Structural basis of effector regulation and signal termination in heterotrimeric Galpha proteins Adv. Protein Chem. 2007; 74 :1-65 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the presence of Asp229 in Gα s , a position conserved as serine in all other Gα subfamilies, renders it incapable of RGS binding in Gα s family members ( Natochin and Artemyev, 1998 76. Natochin, M. ∙ Artemyev, N.O. A single mutation Asp229--> Ser confers upon Gs alpha the ability to interact with regulators of G protein signaling Biochemistry. 1998; 37 :13776-13780 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) due to collisions with the α5–α6 loop of RGS proteins ( Figures S5 O and S5P). The Gα s D229S mutation restores the ability of RGS4 and RGS16 to bind and the ability of RGS16 to accelerate GTP hydrolysis on Gα s ( Natochin and Artemyev, 1998 76. Natochin, M. ∙ Artemyev, N.O. A single mutation Asp229--> Ser confers upon Gs alpha the ability to interact with regulators of G protein signaling Biochemistry. 1998; 37 :13776-13780 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To study how global patterns of RGS-Gα selectivity affect the processing of GPCR signals endogenously, we used striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) as a model ( Figure 3 A). The MSNs were chosen because of their undisputed physiological importance and the critical role of several well-defined GPCRs in processing neuromodulatory inputs to these neurons ( Girault, 2012 29. Girault, J.A. Signaling in striatal neurons: the phosphoproteins of reward, addiction, and dyskinesia Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2012; 106 :33-62 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xie and Martemyanov, 2011 122. Xie, K. ∙ Martemyanov, K.A. Control of striatal signaling by g protein regulators Front. Neuroanat. 2011; 5 :49 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 B). More important, several RGS proteins in the MSNs have been implicated in controlling behavioral responses to GPCR stimulation. The best-documented examples of these are RGS4 ( Han et al., 2010 36. Han, M.H. ∙ Renthal, W. ∙ Ring, R.H. ... Brain region specific actions of regulator of G protein signaling 4 oppose morphine reward and dependence but promote analgesia Biol. Psychiatry. 2010; 67 :761-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Michaelides et al., 2020 73. Michaelides, M. ∙ Miller, M.L. ∙ Egervari, G. ... Striatal Rgs4 regulates feeding and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity Mol. Psychiatry. 2020; 25 :2058-2069 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), a member of the R4 subfamily, and RGS9 ( Traynor et al., 2009 113. Traynor, J.R. ∙ Terzi, D. ∙ Caldarone, B.J. ... RGS9-2: probing an intracellular modulator of behavior as a drug target Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 30 :105-111 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), a member of the R7 subfamily.
We surveyed the expression landscape of RGS and Gα proteins by curating the available quantitative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data ( Gokce et al., 2016 32. Gokce, O. ∙ Stanley, G.M. ∙ Treutlein, B. ... Cellular Taxonomy of the Mouse Striatum as Revealed by Single-Cell RNA-Seq Cell Rep. 2016; 16 :1126-1137 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). This analysis revealed a significant expression of 12 RGS genes, with RGS4 and RGS9 being the most abundant. Three members of the R4 subfamily (RGS4, RGS2, and RGS8) and 3 members of the R7 subfamilies (RGS9, RGS11, and RGS7) were estimated to be more highly expressed by at least an order of magnitude than other striatal RGS proteins ( Figure 3 C). Interestingly, our dataset indicates that these RGS subfamilies have distinct patterns of Gα selectivity; the R7 RGS proteins are narrowly tuned for G i/o , whereas the R4 RGS members are capable of regulating a broad spectrum of Gα, including both G i/o and G q members ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Accordingly, transcripts encoding the members (Gα o , Gα i1–3 , Gα z , Gα q , and Gα 11 ) of the Gα i/o and Gα q subfamilies were abundantly expressed by the MSNs ( Figure 3 C). Thus, we predicted that R4 RGS proteins would have a major influence on the processing of GPCR signals via both G i/o and G q pathways, whereas R7 RGS proteins would selectively affect only Gα i/o -mediated signals.
To test this prediction, we used biosensors to monitor the dynamics of second messenger pathway engagement downstream of both G i/o and G q while inactivating RGS proteins by CRISPR-Cas9 editing in the primary cultures of MSNs ( Figure 3 D). The G i/o activity was assessed by studying its inhibitory influence on cyclic AMP (cAMP) production in response to stimulation of the G i/o -coupled dopamine receptor D2 (D2R) by dopamine, whereas G q -type activity was monitored by Ca 2+ transients induced in response to the activation of the muscarinic M1/M3 receptors (M1/3R) by acetylcholine ( Figure 3 B). Considering the intra-class similarity of RGS-Gα pairing and abundant expression of several members from each RGS class, we chose to simultaneously eliminate all MSN-expressed RGS proteins belonging to the same subfamily by CRISPR-Cas9 editing. The elimination of either the R4 or the R7 subfamily resulted in a significantly enhanced cAMP response, consistent with the role of these RGS members in the deactivation of the G i/o pathway ( Figures 3 E and 3F). In contrast, the elimination of R4 members but not R7 proteins augmented the Ca 2+ response, which is in line with their observed Gα selectivity profiles ( Figures 3 G and 3H).
We next tested the effect of overexpressing individual RGS proteins. We chose to focus on RGS2, an abundantly expressed RGS protein, widely believed to be G q selective based on biochemical measurements but able to regulate G i/o proteins according to our data ( Figures 1 J and S4 ). The overexpression of RGS2 had an opposite effect from eliminating RGS proteins and dramatically suppressed the amplitudes of both cAMP and calcium responses ( Figures 3 I–3L). These observations indicate that the comprehensive RGS-Gα selectivity maps have predictive power in dissecting the logic of GPCR signal processing in an endogenous setting.
The analysis presented in this study revealed a wide range of Gα preferences across RGS proteins, which also feature considerable structural diversity ( Riddle et al., 2005 90. Riddle, E.L. ∙ Schwartzman, R.A. ∙ Bond, M. ... Multi-tasking RGS proteins in the heart: the next therapeutic target? Circ. Res. 2005; 96 :401-411 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This opens questions about the flexibility of recognition patterns across the family and the degree with which Gα selectivity is determined by the RGS domain shared by all RGS proteins. To address these questions in an unbiased way and gain insight into how the selectivity of mammalian RGS subfamilies may have evolved, we performed the reconstitution of ancestral RGS proteins ( Figure 4 A). We traced the RGS family tree to reconstitute common ancestral RGS domains at three branch points before the diversification into the current four subfamilies and generated a series of chimeric RGS proteins ( Figure 4 B).
Examination of the Gα selectivity of the primal ancestral RGS protein (AncR4/Z/12/7) revealed that it regulated all Gα subunits that RGS proteins can regulate, except Gα 15 ( Figures 4 C and 4D). We next reconstructed two ancestral RGS proteins at the roots of the subfamily divisions (AncR4/Z and AncR12/7). Interestingly, AncR4/Z showed equally strong GAP activity toward Gα i/o and Gα q subfamilies, but not toward Gα z ( Figure 4 D). Diversification of this precursor RGS subsequently generated various patterns of Gα i/o - and Gα q selectivity observed in current R4 and RZ subfamilies. The other ancestral RGS protein, AncR12/7, showed Gα i/o selectivity and was devoid of the ability to regulate the Gα q subfamily. This ancestral RGS gave rise to Gα i/o -selective R12 and R7 RGS proteins. These results suggest that Gα selectivity patterns of extant human RGS proteins resulted from a combination of specialization along the Gα i/o versus Gα q axis and de novo acquisition of Gα z and Gα 15 selectivity. This supports a predominantly evolutionary divergence model in which the primordial RGS precursor with balanced activity on different Gα substrates acquired various biases that followed different routes—for example, by suppressing the GAP activity toward the Gα q subfamily in R7 and R12 RGS or re-gaining the activity on Gα i/o subfamily by the R12 RGS. We thus conclude that the sequence composition of the RGS domain has considerable bearing on dictating the evolving Gα preferences of the RGS proteins, strongly suggesting that the major determinants of Gα selectivity are contained within the RGS domain.
Elucidation of a Gα-RGS coupling map and demonstration of the crucial role of the RGS domain in determining the pairings prompted the identification of molecular determinants that govern their differential preferences. We compared the sequences of all human RGS domains, aligning them with reference to 20 available high-resolution structures that show the same conserved fold and preservation of key elements, with 9 α-helices and 10 loops ( Figure S6 A; Data S1 ). RGS11, RGS13, RGS20, and RGS21 were not included in this analysis because their structures have not been reported. This analysis allowed us to develop a Common RGS Numbering (CRN) system for labeling amino acids relative to their structural position similar to what was previously done for Gα ( Flock et al., 2015 24. Flock, T. ∙ Ravarani, C.N.J. ∙ Sun, D. ... Universal allosteric mechanism for Gα activation by GPCRs Nature. 2015; 524 :173-179 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and GPCRs ( Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995 6. Ballesteros, J.A. ∙ Weinstein, H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models and computational probing of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25 :366-428 Crossref Scopus (2090) Google Scholar ; Isberg et al., 2015 50. Isberg, V. ∙ de Graaf, C. ∙ Bortolato, A. ... Generic GPCR residue numbers - aligning topology maps while minding the gaps Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2015; 36 :22-31 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S6 B and S6C). This system helps to identify the position of every residue with reference to the secondary structure. For instance, RGS4 Asn128, which directly binds to Gα i1 , is denoted as L6.10, indicating that this residue is the 10th amino acid located in loop 6 of the RGS domain ( Figure S6 B). It should be noted that this nomenclature cannot be applied to the H6 region in the R12 subfamily because it is structurally distinct from other RGS subfamilies.
We further analyzed eight currently available structures of RGS/Gα complexes and found that all RGS and Gα subunits interact in a very similar manner, with low root mean square deviation (RMSD) in the range of 0.46–1.42 Å. In the RGS domain, there are 11 residues directly contacting Gα that are almost 100% conserved in all structures ( Figure S6 B). In addition to these contacting positions, we found 20 residues on the RGS protein and 38 amino acids on Gα that contribute to the organization of binding interfaces based on their localization within the 5Å radius of any atom in the interface. On the RGS side, these residues are distributed across 3 structural elements, 2 loops (H3–H4 and L6–H6) and 1 helix (H7–L9) ( Figures 5 A and 5B). The surface on Gα is more distributed and involves both GTPase and α-helical domains.
To determine which elements most strongly contribute to the selectivity of Gα recognition, we analyzed these 31 RGS residues at the Gα-binding interface across all 20 human RGS paralogs in comparison with their orthologs from 21–65 animal species ( Figures 5 C and 5D; Data S2 ). This analysis revealed 14 highly conserved positions across orthologs and paralogs, suggesting that they likely serve as invariable architectural pillars that organize Gα binding and/or GAP activity. These residues included all of the direct Gα-contacting positions found in the RGS4/Gα i1 complex ( Figure S6 B). A minor fraction of the scattered residues was ortholog variable and neutrally evolving ( Figures 5 C and 5E). The remaining fraction of ortholog-specific residues comprised 17 amino acids. Mapping them on the RGS domain structure showed that they are distributed at the periphery of the Gα-binding surface, surrounding the central positions of the conserved amino acids ( Figure 5 D), suggesting that they may contribute to Gα selectivity by modulating the interaction. We subsequently refer to these peripheral amino acid residues that are variable among paralogs but conserved within their respective orthologs as Gα selectivity bar codes for RGS proteins.
To identify motifs in the RGS domain that contribute to establishing Gα selectivity, we reconstructed and analyzed the RGS-Gα interaction network at a single amino acid resolution ( Figures 5 F and 5G). This analysis confirmed that the vast majority of selectivity bar code residues are engaged in non-conserved contacts that vary between different structures of the RGS-Gα complexes ( Figure 5 H). In contrast, the contacts involving the conserved residues were also predominantly conserved across RGS-Gα structures ( Figure 5 H). The highest degree of conserved residue-residue contacts is observed for the H3–H4 region with G.H2 and switch I in Gα and for the L7–L9 region with switch I ( Figure 5 F), indicating its crucial role as a structural backbone for RGS/Gα binding. In contrast, the interaction of the H7–L9 region with the α-helical domain showed the highest number of non-conserved contacts ( Figure 5 G), suggesting that these domains could significantly contribute to the RGS/Gα selectivity.
To better characterize the organization of the Gα-binding surface, we analyzed properties of the amino acids that form the Gα selectivity bar codes across different RGS subfamilies. This investigation revealed distinct patterns in accordance with the experimentally determined Gα selectivity patterns ( Figure 5 I). For example, R4 and RZ subfamilies that are dually selective for the G i/o and G q proteins showed a similar distribution of hydrophobic and positively charged residues in the H7–L9 region; hydrophobic and positively and negatively charged residues in L6–H6; and a nucleophilic residue in H3–H4. In contrast, the G i/o -selective R12 family exhibited a different pattern featuring nucleophilic, aromatic, and amide residues in the H7–L9 region, and a unique positively charged patch in the L6–H6 lobe surrounded by the nucleophilic cluster. However, another pattern was observed in the narrowly tuned R7 proteins whose L6–H6 region is populated by small amino acids adjacent to the hydrophobic patch and a prominent positive charge in H7–L9. These findings reinforce the idea that the nature of amino acid properties at the selectivity bar code region on the Gα-binding interface of the RGS protein comprises major determinants of Gα recognition selectivity.
The identification of selectivity bar code residues in RGS proteins raises a question about their necessity and sufficiency in setting the selectivity of Gα recognition. This question was addressed experimentally, by transplanting the entire distributed pattern of selectivity residues ( Figure 6 A). For these experiments, we chose RGS13 and RGS18, which belong to the same R4 subfamily but differ in G protein selectivity ( Figure 6 C). RGS13 prefers G q members over the G i/o subfamily, whereas RGS18 equally regulates both G i/o and G q proteins. A comparison of their Gα selectivity bar codes indicates that they differ by 12 amino acid residues ( Figure S7 A). All of the amino acid residues of RGS13 were replaced with the ones from RGS18, resulting in RGS13/18-F chimera ( Figure 6 B). In agreement with the prediction based on our selectivity bar code model, RGS13/18-F protein exhibited RGS18-like Gα selectivity ( Figure 6 C).
These experiments were then extended to RGS8 and RGS14, a pair that belongs to different subfamilies and also have markedly different Gα selectivity and composition of Gα selectivity residues ( Figures 6 D and 6E). We identified 15 different amino acids within the Gα selectivity bar code different between these RGS proteins ( Figures 6 D and S7 B) and transplanted all of these from RGS14 into corresponding positions of RGS8, generating a “full” chimera (RGS8/14-F) ( Figure 6 D). The RGS8/14-F chimera completely recapitulated the Gα fingerprint of RGS14 without gaining activity on G proteins not regulated by RGS8 or RGS14 ( Figure 6 E). We further probed whether the change in selectivity could be achieved by mutating fewer bar code residues (i.e., by replacing only nine amino acid residues) ( Figures S7 B). The resulting “partial” RGS8/14 chimera (RGS8/14-P) had the same Gα q over Gα i/o preference as parental RGS8 ( Figure S7 C). It thus failed to switch the Gα-selectivity fingerprint from the RGS8 to the RGS14 pattern, indicating that all of the bar code amino acids are required for establishing exact selectivity patterns of Gα-RGS recognition. Curiously, the RGS8/14-P mutant unexpectedly gained activity on Gα z ( Figure S7 D), indicating that individual residues within the bar code can have an impact on the Gα selectivity of RGS proteins. Overall, these results indicate that identified selectivity bar codes are sufficient in dictating Gα substrate preferences.
To gain insight into how ongoing evolutionary diversification shapes Gα selectivity, we analyzed natural variation in RGS sequences. Prevalence analysis of missense variations (MVs) reported for 2,504 healthy individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project ( Auton et al., 2015 5. Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ∙ Durbin, R.M. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (5041) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed that, on average, an individual harbors 5 MVs within the canonical RGS proteins. Examination of the database ( Turner et al., 2017 115. Turner, T.N. ∙ Yi, Q. ∙ Krumm, N. ... denovo-db: a compendium of human de novo variants Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D804-D811 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicated that a de novo MV occurs at approximately every 260 newborns, suggesting that RGS proteins are undergoing active evolution. We further analyzed the data on MVs within all of the canonical RGS proteins in 141,456 individuals ( Data S3 ) from the gnomAD database ( Karczewski et al., 2020 52. Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Francioli, L.C. ∙ Tiao, G. ..., Genome Aggregation Database Consortium The mutational constraint spectrum quantified from variation in 141,456 humans Nature. 2020; 581 :434-443 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found 106,521 rare MVs (minor allele frequency < 2%), with 79,167 MVs on the outside of the RGS domain, 27,354 MVs in the RGS domain, 1,220 MVs in conserved residues, and 1,757 MVs in selectivity residues ( Figure 7 A). In this analysis, the same variant type is counted multiple times if it occurs in multiple people, illustrating the scale of ongoing evolution ( Figures 7 A–7D). On average, 13 MVs exist in each amino acid residue of RGS proteins ( Figure 7 A). This density of MVs (14.8) was the highest outside of the RGS domain. In contrast, functionally important regions exhibited lower densities. The conserved and selectivity residues in RGS11 were the most variable among all of the RGS proteins ( Figures 7 B and 7C). The ratio of the MV density between selectivity and conserved residues revealed the highest MV frequency in the selectivity residues over the conserved residues in RGS17 ( Figure 7 D), suggesting likely extensive natural variation of Gα selectivity in RGS17.
To understand the functional implications of the observed variations, we investigated the impact of randomly chosen seven mutations across various positions in the selectivity bar code region of six RGS proteins by testing their activity on the panel of six Gα subunits ( Figure 7 E). We found that all of the evaluated amino acid changes affected Gα selectivity. Notably, changes at L7.13 in RGS19 (R190W) increased the GAP activity toward Gα 15 , but decreased the activity on Gα o , Gα i1 , and Gα q without any influence on Gα z . Alterations in L6.8, H6.2, H7.6, and H7.9 selectively augmented the regulation of Gα i/o without diminishing the activity on other Gα. The balance between Gα i and Gα o regulation can also be affected by these mutations—for example, E98G (L6.8) in RGS13 preferentially increased activity toward Gα o over Gα i , while R351Q (H6.2) in RGS11 and N164S (H7.9) in RGS12 augmented Gα i regulation more than Gα o . Altering the H6.4 position in RGS9 M370K resulted in a net loss of activity across Gα regulated by this RGS.
Interestingly, variants in RGS proteins are also increasingly viewed as possibly contributing to pathological conditions due to generally disruptive effects ( DiGiacomo et al., 2020 17. DiGiacomo, V. ∙ Maziarz, M. ∙ Luebbers, A. ... Probing the mutational landscape of regulators of G protein signaling proteins in cancer Sci.

Rev. 2018; 70 :446-474 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the exact mechanisms of functional alterations and implications for Gα selectivity for a vast number of cases remain unexplored. For instance, RGS16 has been recently implicated in insomnia ( Hu et al., 2016 45. Hu, Y. ∙ Shmygelska, A. ∙ Tran, D. ...

Commun. 2016; 7 :10889 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and knockout of this gene in mice disrupts circadian regulation ( Doi et al., 2011 19. Doi, M. ∙ Ishida, A. ∙ Miyake, A. ... Circadian regulation of intracellular G-protein signalling mediates intercellular synchrony and rhythmicity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus Nat. Commun. 2011; 2 :327 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genetic variation (rs1144566) in human RGS16 reported in the genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog ( Buniello et al., 2019 12. Buniello, A. ∙ MacArthur, J.A.L. ∙ Cerezo, M. ... The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog of published genome-wide association studies, targeted arrays and summary statistics 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D1005-D1012 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ) affects selectivity bar code residue H6.4 ( Figures 7 F and 7G). We experimentally evaluated the functional implication of minor allele variations in H6.4 of RGS16 prevalently occupied by arginine. Our data showed that the R137P mutation nearly completely abrogated the GAP activity of RGS16 for both of its representative preferred substrates, Gα o and Gα q , indicating a strong loss of function ( Figure 7 H). Curiously, the R137L substitution selectively compromised the activity of RGS16 only on Gα q without significant effects on the regulation of Gα o . These results indicate that mutations in the selectivity bar code may lead to RGS dysfunction associated not only with the complete loss of function but also with a more subtle alteration in the Gα selectivity.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we present a nearly complete map of Gα recognition selectivity for all 20 canonical human RGS proteins. The wealth of accumulated evidence in the past 2 decades since their discovery revealed that members of the RGS family exert two distinct effects on the G protein signaling. First, they accelerate G protein deactivation and thus control the duration of signaling. The slow intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits rate limits the termination of the response and does not permit the rapid signaling cycles often demanded by the physiological processes (e.g., in neuronal communication and cardiac activity). By accelerating the Gα GTPase, RGS proteins speed up termination of the response and thereby increase the temporal fidelity of GPCR-initiated signaling. This function is best exemplified by studies on photoreceptors in which the loss of RGS protein in the visual cascade initiated by rhodopsin diminishes the temporal resolution of visual signals, preventing the detection of moving objects ( Chen et al., 2000 14. Chen, C.K. ∙ Burns, M.E. ∙ He, W. ... Slowed recovery of rod photoresponse in mice lacking the GTPase accelerating protein RGS9-1 Nature. 2000; 403 :557-560 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, by deactivating G proteins and/or competing with the effector molecules, RGS proteins interfere with signal propagation, thus taming the extent of signaling ( Hepler et al., 1997 39. Hepler, J.R. ∙ Berman, D.M. ∙ Gilman, A.G. ... RGS4 and GAIP are GTPase-activating proteins for Gq alpha and block activation of phospholipase C beta by gamma-thio-GTP-Gq alpha Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2010; 107 :7066-7071 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) and allowing adjustment of the signaling volume, depending on the physiological needs. The loss of this RGS function is well noted to sensitize responses causing cellular overreactivity ( Lamberts et al., 2013 60. Lamberts, J.T. ∙ Smith, C.E. ∙ Li, M.H. ...

Gβ5-RGS complexes are gatekeepers of hyperactivity involved in control of multiple neurotransmitter systems Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2012; 219 :823-834 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). From this perspective, RGS proteins could be considered endogenous genetically encoded antagonists of GPCR signaling.
The results of our systematic profiling of RGS substrate preferences prompt reconsideration of the mechanisms involved in cellular signaling diversification. Despite their large numbers, GPCRs can only signal through the same limited number of G proteins that they can activate. Previous studies indicated that signaling diversity is in part dictated by a combination of G proteins activated by individual GPCRs ( Inoue et al., 2019 49. Inoue, A. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Kadji, F.M.N. ... Illuminating G-Protein-Coupling Selectivity of GPCRs Cell. 2019; 177 :1933-1947.e25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Masuho et al., 2015b 72.

Signal. 2015; 8 :ra123 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). The negative regulation of individual Gα by RGS proteins, if sufficiently selective, would greatly contribute to signaling diversification to allow much more refined signaling characteristics with cellular specificity depending on the available RGS and G proteins. Whereas recent large-scale efforts have provided tremendous system-level insights into the selectivity of G protein activation by GPCRs ( Flock et al., 2015 24. Flock, T. ∙ Ravarani, C.N.J. ∙ Sun, D. ... Universal allosteric mechanism for Gα activation by GPCRs Nature. 2015; 524 :173-179 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Inoue et al., 2019 49.

Signal. 2015; 8 :ra123 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), the information about the selectivity of RGS has been missing. We fill this gap by establishing Gα selectivity profiles for the entire family of RGS proteins. Based on this information, we propose that RGSs and GPCRs work in synergy to generate diverse cell-type-specific signaling.
Although the experiments presented in this study demonstrate the importance of the bar code residues on the Gα-interacting interface of RGS proteins in dictating Gα preferences, the sufficiency of this residue-residue contact network in dictating precise selectivity patterns across the entire RGS family remains to be tested. It appears quite likely that the secondary network of residues that make contact with the Gα-binding residues on the surface can further adjust and/or reinforce the stringency of Gα recognition. In support of this possibility, members of the R4 subfamily show more diverse functional properties than sequence similarity, suggesting contributions of additional residues within the RGS domain outside of the Gα-interacting surface in shaping Gα selectivity. This is consistent with the results of our ancestral reconstitution experiments, that shuffling wider group of the amino acid residues in the entire RGS domain can also modulate Gα selectivity. Furthermore, elements outside of the RGS domains may further contribute to the Gα recognition preferences of RGS proteins. Such a possibility is suggested by studies on complex multi-modular members of the R7 family, in which interaction partners (Gβ 5 and R7BP) ( Levay et al., 1999 65.

Finally, several RGS proteins also interact with GPCRs, G protein effectors, and scaffold proteins ( Abramow-Newerly et al., 2006 1. Abramow-Newerly, M. ∙ Roy, A.A. ∙ Nunn, C. ... RGS proteins have a signalling complex: interactions between RGS proteins and GPCRs, effectors, and auxiliary proteins Cell.

Although these possibilities were not addressed in this study, our experiments with shuffling determinants, mutagenesis, and ancestral reconstitutions all within the RGS domain indicate that these additional mechanisms may contribute to establishing the Gα selectivity but are unlikely to completely overwrite it.
Previous biochemical studies used purified recombinant proteins to examine the preferences of RGS proteins on Gα substrates selected ad hoc yielding important information that has served as a reference for RGS-Gα pairing. For example, RGS4 was shown to regulate both Gα i/o and Gα q subfamilies, but not Gα s or Gα 12 ( Berman et al., 1996a 10. Berman, D.M. ∙ Kozasa, T. ∙ Gilman, A.G.

USA. 1997; 94 :428-432 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, RGS2 was found to have no appreciable GAP activity toward Gα i/o and to be selective for Gα q in both solution GTPase assays and pull-down experiments ( Heximer et al., 1997 40. Heximer, S.P. ∙ Watson, N. ∙ Linder, M.E. ... RGS2/G0S8 is a selective inhibitor of Gqalpha function Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 1998; 95 :13307-13312 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The selectivity of RGS7 for Gα o over Gα i was observed with the purified RGS domain ( Lan et al., 2000 62. Lan, K.L. ∙ Zhong, H. ∙ Nanamori, M. ... Rapid kinetics of regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS)-mediated Galphai and Galphao deactivation. Galpha specificity of RGS4 AND RGS7 J. Biol.

Gα z selectivity of RZ subfamily members RGS17 (RGSZ2), RGS19 (GAIP), and RGS20 (RGSZ1) was also observed ( Glick et al., 1998 30. Glick, J.L. ∙ Meigs, T.E. ∙ Miron, A. ...

Chem. 1998; 273 :26014-26025 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, an R12 RGS member, RGS10, has been shown to regulate Gα o , Gα i , and Gα z , but not Gα s ( Hunt et al., 1996 47. Hunt, T.W. ∙ Fields, T.A. ∙ Casey, P.J. ...

USA. 1997; 94 :7216-7220 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our investigation confirms many of the previously noted Gα preferences of RGS proteins, while additionally refining them to include G proteins not previously studied. However, in some cases, our results contradict previously documented coupling. One of the notable examples of this is Gα q selectivity of RGS2. Although our investigation shows that RGS2 can indeed regulate several members of the Gα q subfamily, we also find that it exhibits strong activity on the Gα i/o proteins comparable to that on Gα q . We think that the discrepancy is largely related to the choice of the assay system. Most of the previous studies used purified RGS and Gα proteins and measured GTP hydrolysis rates using biochemical assays conducted in solution. This approach has limited sensitivity and is devoid of the membrane environment where GPCRs, RGS, and G proteins normally operate under physiological context. In fact, the activity of RGS proteins has been shown to be significantly modulated by the membranes and lipid modification on Gα subunits ( Tu et al., 1997 114. Tu, Y. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Ross, E.M. Inhibition of brain Gz GAP and other RGS proteins by palmitoylation of G protein alpha subunits Science. 1997; 278 :1132-1135 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the proteoliposome-based assay was found to yield ∼100-fold higher sensitivity as compared to the solution-based assay ( Posner et al., 1999b 87. Posner, B.A. ∙ Mukhopadhyay, S. ∙ Tesmer, J.J. ... Modulation of the affinity and selectivity of RGS protein interaction with G alpha subunits by a conserved asparagine/serine residue Biochemistry. 1999; 38 :7773-7779 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). RGS2, in particular, was noted to act on Gα i/o in the presence of lipid bilayer ( Ingi et al., 1998 48. Ingi, T. ∙ Krumins, A.M. ∙ Chidiac, P. ... Dynamic regulation of RGS2 suggests a novel mechanism in G-protein signaling and neuronal plasticity J. Neurosci. 1998; 18 :7178-7188 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the cellular BRET assay strategy that we chose provides physiologically relevant information on RGS-Gα coupling as it exploits the endogenous environment and appropriate context of RGS action.
One of the key insights provided by this work is the delineation of the determinants involved in RGS-Gα recognition. Establishing principles involved in the selectivity of protein-protein interaction has been a major goal of many investigations ( Flock et al., 2017 25. Flock, T. ∙ Hauser, A.S. ∙ Lund, N. ... Selectivity determinants of GPCR-G-protein binding Nature. 2017; 545 :317-322 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nooren and Thornton, 2003 79. Nooren, I.M. ∙ Thornton, J.M. Structural characterisation and functional significance of transient protein-protein interactions J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325 :991-1018 Crossref Scopus (443) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interaction between RGS and Gα provides an excellent model for interrogation of the underlying principles with possible general implications. Both protein families are well represented by numerous members with clearly defined orthologs and paralogs, and conservation of the structural organization ( Baltoumas et al., 2013 7. Baltoumas, F.A. ∙ Theodoropoulou, M.C. ∙ Hamodrakas, S.J. Interactions of the α-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins with GPCRs, effectors and RGS proteins: a critical review and analysis of interacting surfaces, conformational shifts, structural diversity and electrostatic potentials J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 182 :209-218 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tesmer, 2009 112. Tesmer, J.J. Structure and function of regulator of G protein signaling homology domains Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2009; 86 :75-113 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the experimental definition of the Gα preferences of all of the RGS proteins naturally prompted dissection of the underlying selectivity determinants. This study was focused on examining the contribution of the Gα-binding surface of the RGS domain. A combination of gene orthology/paralogy analysis with structural mapping identified a set of 17 variable amino acids that surround the core critical for forming direct contacts with the Gα subunits. We found that mutations in these amino acids significantly change the Gα preferences of RGS proteins. Interestingly, transplanting sets of variable amino acids from one RGS protein to another completely overwrites the Gα selectivity of the recipient. These observations support the idea that the selectivity of Gα recognition is, at least in part, encoded by the property of the amino acids that form this bar code region on the surface.
Previous studies explored the role of electrostatic interactions in specifying the selectivity of Gα recognition by several RGS proteins across all of the subfamilies ( Asli et al., 2018 4. Asli, A. ∙ Sadiya, I. ∙ Avital-Shacham, M. ... “Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits Sci.

Biol. 2011; 18 :846-853 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Salem-Mansour et al., 2018 96. Salem-Mansour, D. ∙ Asli, A. ∙ Avital-Shacham, M. ... Structural motifs in the RGS RZ subfamily combine to attenuate interactions with Gα subunits Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2018; 503 :2736-2741 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, these studies reported 12 amino acid residues in RGS proteins that influence their ability to recognize Gα. Mutation of these residues either alone or in combination (up to 7 simultaneously) was shown to either increase or decrease the GAP activity of RGS proteins on the Gα substrates of choice. These studies examined one Gα substrate at a time, thus making it unclear whether the manipulations resulted in switching relative Gα preferences for a given RGS as opposed to overall gain or loss of substrate recognition. Nevertheless, these studies convincingly demonstrate that changes in electrostatic properties of amino acids at the RGS-Gα interface can alter the efficiency of the Gα recognition. Interestingly, all but two (H4.4 and H5.14) of these residues mapped on the Gα selectivity bar code region identified in this study, supporting the idea that electrostatic interactions play an important role in shaping the selectivity of RGS-Gα recognition. Similarly, mutations in RGS2 at the interface with the α-helical domain of Gα subunit diminished GAP activity on Gα q ( Nance et al., 2013 75. Nance, M.R. ∙ Kreutz, B. ∙ Tesmer, V.M. ... Structural and functional analysis of the regulator of G protein signaling 2-gαq complex Structure. 2013; 21 :438-448 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with a large number of contacts made by the α-helical domain with the RGS domain, our analysis shows that variants mapping to this domain in several RGS proteins (H7.6, H7.9, H8.3) affect their Gα selectivity. Taken together with our observations that even single amino acid substitutions within the selectivity bar code can change the Gα preferences of RGS proteins, these results point to critical determinants of RGS-Gα recognition. Curiously, we found that altering these determinants can generate RGS proteins with novel selectivity profiles not displayed by canonical members of the family (e.g., RGS8/14-P, AncR4/Z/12/7; see Figures 4 and 6 ). Thus, we believe that the Gα-selectivity determinants identified here may pave the way for the de novo creation of RGS proteins with rationally designed G protein selectivity.
Our findings also have implications for pharmacogenomics and understanding disease mechanisms associated with the disruption in RGS-mediated G protein control. We uncovered a significant variation affecting nearly all of the RGS proteins. More importantly, many of these variants occurred in selectivity bar code domains and were found experimentally to affect the Gα selectivity of RGS proteins. These genetic alterations are expected to change the profiles of signaling pathways engaged by the GPCRs, creating a situation that the same drug targeting the same receptor would produce varying effects due to RGS heterogeneity. Such a situation may be cryptic in the population if one only profiles variation within GPCRs ( Hauser et al., 2018 37. Hauser, A.S. ∙ Chavali, S. ∙ Masuho, I. ... Pharmacogenomics of GPCR Drug Targets Cell. 2018; 172 :41-54 e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ), but it may still lead to interindividual variability in drug response. Therefore, understanding the impact of RGS proteins and their genetic variability on GPCR signaling is expected to be important for individualizing drug prescriptions in the implementation of precision medicine.

All experimental work involving mice was approved by The Scripps Research Institute’s IACUC committee in accordance with NIH guidelines. Mice were housed under standard conditions in a pathogen-free facility on a 12:12 light:dark hour cycle with continuous access to food and water. Male and female CAMPER (Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm1(CAG-ECFP∗/Rapgef3/Venus∗)Kama and wild-type C57/Bl6 mice of both sexes aged from postnatal day 0 to postnatal day 3 were utilized in these studies and were not subjected to any prior experiments.
HEK293T/17 cells were obtained from ATTC (Manassas, VA) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, minimum Eagle’s medium non-essential amino acids, 1mM sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO 2 .
Primary striatal neurons were cultured similar to previous work ( Muntean et al., 2018 74. Muntean, B.S. ∙ Zucca, S. ∙ MacMullen, C.M. ...

The striatum from either wild-type or homozygous CAMPER pups were rapidly isolated at age P0 in ice-cold HBSS supplemented with 20% FBS, 4.2 mM NaHCO 3 , and 1 mM HEPES. Striatal tissue was washed in HBSS without FBS prior to digestion at 37°C for 15 minutes in a buffer (pH 7.2) containing 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 25 mM HEPES, and 0.3 mg/ml papain. Striatal tissue was washed three times with HBSS (20% FBS), three times with HBSS, and three times with growth media (Neurobasal-A containing 2 mM GlutaMAX, 2% B27 Supplement serum-free, and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin). Striatal tissue was then dissociated through pipetting ∼15 times with a standard P1000 pipette in the presence of DNase I (0.05 U/μL) and plated on poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Half of the growth media was replenished every three days. For Ca 2+ imaging, neuronal cultures from wild-type mice were incubated for 14-18 days with lentiviral-containing supernatant and AAV9-syn-FLEX-jGCaMP7s-WPRE. For cAMP imaging, neuronal cultures from CAMPER mice were incubated for 14-18 days with lentiviral-containing supernatant. Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transfect RGS2 along with control pSECC (1 μg each/coverslip) in wild-type or CAMPER neurons as indicated in the text for overexpression experiments.

For transfection, cells were seeded into 3.5-cm dishes at a density of 2 × 10 6 cells/dish. After 2 h, expression constructs (total 5 μg/dish) were transfected into the cells using PLUS (5 μl/dish) and Lipofectamine LTX (6 μl/dish) reagents. The GPCR (dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) (1) for Gi/o, M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R) (1) for Gq, dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) (1) for Gs, and bradykinin B2 receptor (BDKRB2) (1) for G12/13), Gα (Gα oA (2), Gα oB (1), Gα i1 (1), Gα i2 (2), Gα i3 (1.5), Gα z (1.5), Gα q (2), Gα 11 (2), Gα 14 (4), Gα 15 (2), Gα s short (6), Gα s long (4), Gα olf (6), Gα 12 (3), or Gα 13 (4)), Venus 156-239-Gβ 1 (1), Venus 1-155-Gγ 2 (1), masGRK3ct-Nluc-HA (1) were transfected with different amounts of RGS construct (the number in parentheses indicates the ratio of transfected DNA (ratio 1 = 0.21 μg)). RGS1 (12), RGS2 (12), RGS3-2 (6), RGS4 (12), RGS5 (12), RGS6/Gβ 5S (1), RGS7/Gβ 5S (2), RGS8 (6), RGS9-1/Gβ 5L (2), RGS10 (6), RG11/Gβ 5S (6), RGS12 (6), RGS13 (6), RGS14 (6), RGS16 (6), RGS17 (6), RGS18 (12), RGS19 (6), RGS20 (6), and RGS21 (12) were transfected to examine comprehensive G protein selectivity.

A construct carrying catalytic subunit of pertussis toxin PTX-S1 were transfected with Gα z , M3R, D1R, or BDKRB2 to inhibit the possible coupling of endogenous Gi/o to GPCRs. An empty vector (pcDNA3.1(+)) was used to normalize the amount of transfected DNA.
Cellular measurements of BRET between Venus-Gβ 1 γ 2 and masGRK3ct-Nluc-HA were performed to examine GAP activity of RGS protein in living cells (described in detail in Masuho et al., 2015a 71. Masuho, I. ∙ Martemyanov, K.A. ∙ Lambert, N.A. Monitoring G Protein Activation in Cells with BRET Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1335 :107-113 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015b 72. Masuho, I. ∙ Ostrovskaya, O. ∙ Kramer, G.M. ... Distinct profiles of functional discrimination among G proteins determine the actions of G protein-coupled receptors Sci. Signal. 2015; 8 :ra123 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sixteen to twenty-four hr post-transfection, HEK293T/17 cells were washed once with BRET buffer (Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) containing 0.5mM MgCl 2 and 0.1% glucose) and detached by gentle pipetting over the monolayer. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min and resuspended in BRET buffer. Approximately 50,000 to 100,000 cells per well were distributed in 96-well flatbottomed white microplates (Greiner Bio-One). The NanoLuc (Nluc) substrate, furimazine ( Hall et al., 2012 35. Hall, M.P. ∙ Unch, J. ∙ Binkowski, B.F. ... Engineered luciferase reporter from a deep sea shrimp utilizing a novel imidazopyrazinone substrate ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7 :1848-1857 Crossref Scopus (569) PubMed Google Scholar ), were purchased from Promega and used according to the manufacturer’s instruction. BRET measurements were made using a microplate reader (POLARstar Omega; BMG Labtech) equipped with two emission photomultiplier tubes, allowing us to detect two emissions simultaneously with the highest possible resolution of 20 ms per data point. All measurements were performed at room temperature. To activate and then deactivate, the final concentration of 100 μM ligands were used. Specifically, dopamine and haloperidol for D2R, dopamine and SCH39166 for D1R, acetylcholine and atropine for M3R, and bradykinin and B-9430 for BDKRB2 were applied on the transfected cells to control the activity of those GPCRs. The BRET signal is determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the Venus- Gβ 1 γ 2 (535 nm with a 30 nm band path width) over the light emitted by the masGRK3ct-Nluc-HA (475 nm with a 30 nm band path width). The average baseline value (basal BRET ratio) recorded prior to agonist stimulation was subtracted from the experimental BRET signal values and the resulting difference (ΔBRET ratio) was normalized against the maximal ΔBRET value recorded upon agonist stimulation. The rate constants (1/τ) of the deactivation phases were obtained by fitting a single exponential curve to the traces with Clampfit 10.3. k GAP rate constants were determined by subtracting the basal deactivation rate ( k app ) from the deactivation rate measured in the presence of exogenous RGS protein. Obtained k GAP rate constants were used to quantify GAP activity.
For each 3.5-cm dish, transfected cells were lysed in 1 mL of sample buffer (62.5 mM tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 M urea, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, bromophenol blue (0.08 mg/ml)). Western blotting analysis of proteins was performed after samples were resolved by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30min at room temperature, which was followed by 90 min incubation with specific antibodies diluted in PBST containing 1% skim milk (anti-D2R antibody (1:1,000), anti-M3R antibody (1,1,000), anti-Gα o antibody (1:1,000), anti-Gα q antibody (1:1,000), anti-GFP antibody (1:1,000), anti-HA antibody (1:1,000), anti-c- myc antibody (1:1,000), anti-RGS13 antibody (1:1,000), anti-RGS18 antibody (1:5,000), and anti-GAPDH antibody (1:10,000)). Blots were washed in PBST and incubated for 45 min with a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in PBST containing 1% skim milk. Western blotting was performed with BlotCycler automated western blot processor (Precision Biosystems). Proteins were visualized with Kwik Quant imager (Kindle Biosciences).

According to the design, oligo DNAs were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The oligo DNAs were treated by T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed in a thermal cycler. Finally, the oligo DNAs were ligated into the BsmBI site of the pSECC vector with T4 DNA Ligase. Three sgRNA constructs were made for each target gene. The plasmids were purified from Stbl3 E. coli . Lentiviruses were generated by Lipofectamine LTX-mediated transfection of HEK293T/17 cells with the packaging vectors, pSECC, pCMV-VSV-G, pMDLg/pRRE, and pRSV-Rev. The supernatant containing the lentiviral particles was collected at 48 hours post-transfection.
Primary neuronal cultures were imaged under a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope through a 25x objective lens. Changes in cAMP were recorded from CAMPER neurons, as previously described ( Doyle et al., 2019 20. Doyle, T.B. ∙ Muntean, B.S. ∙ Ejendal, K.F. ...

Briefly, excitation of mTurquoise FRET donor with a 442 nm diode laser was paired with simultaneous acquisition of XYZ image stacks at 10 s intervals collected through two HyD detectors tuned to 465-505 nm (mTurquoise FRET donor) and 525–600 nm (Venus FRET acceptor). Quantification of fluorescence intensity was performed on neuronal cell bodies using ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 98. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (23351) PubMed Google Scholar ) to calculate FRET from the donor/acceptor ratio. The FRET ratio was converted to the concentration of cAMP using a dose-response curve to cAMP standards in permeabilized neurons. Segregated dopamine receptor subtype expression in striatal neurons enabled the identification of D2R-expressing neurons according to the directionality of cAMP response to dopamine. Dopamine was added in phasic puffs during continuous perfusion (2 mL/minute) of a pH 7.2 buffer consisting of 1.3 mM CaCl 2 , 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.4 mM MgSO 4 , 0.4 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 4.2 mM NaHCO 3 , 138 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 5.6 mM D-Glucose, and 20 mM HEPES. Changes in intracellular calcium concentration were recorded from wild-type neurons expressing jGCaMP7s. Excitation was performed with a 488 nm laser, and the acquisition of XYZ image stacks at 1 s intervals was collected through a HyD detector tuned to 494–593 nm. Quantification of fluorescence intensity was performed on neuronal cell bodies using ImageJ. Acetylcholine was added in phasic puffs during continuous perfusion (2 mL/minute) of a pH 7.3 buffer consisting of 2.2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 138 mM NaCl, 11 mM D-Glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 50 μM picrotoxin, 300 nM CGP55845, and 10 μM DNQX.
Whole protein sequences of human RGS proteins were downloaded from the UniProt database ( https://www.uniprot.org/ ). The core RGS domain in each of these human RGS proteins was assigned based on HMMER searches conducted on pfam database domain profiles using human RGS proteins. Then the core RGS domains assigned in all of the human RGS paralogs were aligned using MSAProbs ( Liu et al., 2010 66. Liu, Y. ∙ Schmidt, B. ∙ Maskell, D.L. MSAProbs: multiple sequence alignment based on pair hidden Markov models and partition function posterior probabilities Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :1958-1964 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) and this alignment was termed as h uman R GS d omain a lignment (HRDA). Animal orthologs of RGS proteins were obtained from the OMA database ( https://omabrowser.org/oma/home/ ) ( Altenhoff et al., 2018 2. Altenhoff, A.M. ∙ Glover, N.M. ∙ Train, C.M. ... The OMA orthology database in 2018: retrieving evolutionary relationships among all domains of life through richer web and programmatic interfaces Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D477-D485 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ) and equivalent regions to the core RGS domain of human RGS were only considered for further investigations. We aligned the core RGS domain regions in the animal orthologs with human ones. For each human RGS, i.e., RGS1 to RGS21, we constructed multiple sequence alignments of the given RGS with its corresponding animal orthologs.
We developed a common RGS numbering scheme (CRN), by integrating consensus secondary structure information of available crystal structures of the RGS domain on to HRDA sequence alignment. This allowed us to uniquely assign an alignment position to a combination three types of information: 1) Secondary structural element i . e . “H” for helix, “S” for strand and “L” for loop, along with the index of the secondary structural element i . e . “H1” stands for helix number 1 and “L2” stands for loop number 2, etc. 2) Residue number of the alignment position within the index of the given structural element i . e . “H1.12” denotes 12th position in helix number 1 or helix H1 or L3.2 denotes 2nd position in loop number 3 or loop L3.
For any given alignment position n in the alignment, amino acid residues at this position for across organisms R i , where i = 1 to m, where m is the total number of sequences in the alignment.

To identify the ortholog specific conserved residues and commonly conserved residues between paralogs of human RGS in the core RGS domain. We developed a strategy, by comparing assigning the CRN to each of the RGS alignments and we then categorized the residue at a given CRN position is: (a) Ortholog-specifically conserved if the normalized BLOSUM score for this CRN is 1.5 times higher in a given RGS alignment than in the equivalent CRN of HRDA alignment position and the given CRN position also displays above average normalized BLOSUM score within the RGS alignment. (b) Paralog-specifically conserved if the normalized BLOSUM score for this CRN in the HRDA alignment is 1.5 times higher than in the equivalent CRN of RGS alignment and the given position displays above average normalized BLOSUM score within the HRDA alignment. (c) Conserved in both if CRN in RGS alignment and the HRDA display comparable normalized BLOSUM scores, i.e., within 1.5 times normalized BLOSUM score of either of them. The given position displays above average normalized BLOSUM score within the HRDA and RGS alignments. (d) Neutrally evolving if the above three conditions were not met. The alignment of RGS domain from orthologs is provided as Data S1 and S2 . In the datasets, the residue numbers following the accession OMA database ID and UniProt ID or Ensembl database ID are presented.
The reconstitution of ancestral RGS proteins based on the computational algorithm using FastML was performed ( Ashkenazy et al., 2012 3. Ashkenazy, H. ∙ Penn, O. ∙ Doron-Faigenboim, A. ... FastML: a web server for probabilistic reconstruction of ancestral sequences Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :W580-W584 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) on different groups of RGS alignments i . e ., for e . g ., R4, RZ, R12, and all RGS proteins. Ancestral reconstruction methods identify most likely sequences, including indels, in a specific ancestral node in a phylogenetic tree for given multiple sequence alignment.
Multiple t tests with correction for multiple comparison using the Holm–Sidak method was conducted to determine the effect of RGS on the deactivation rates of Gα subunits with GraphPad Prism Ver. 6. Only statistically significant values are plotted. Values represent means ± SEM from three independent experiments each performed with three replicates.
