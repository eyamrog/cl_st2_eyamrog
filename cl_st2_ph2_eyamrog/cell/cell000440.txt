Title: NNT mediates redox-dependent pigmentation via a UVB- and MITF-independent mechanism


Abstract: Summary

Ultraviolet (UV) light and incompletely understood genetic and epigenetic variations determine skin color. Here we describe an UV- and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-independent mechanism of skin pigmentation. Targeting the mitochondrial redox-regulating enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) resulted in cellular redox changes that affect tyrosinase degradation. These changes regulate melanosome maturation and, consequently, eumelanin levels and pigmentation. Topical application of small-molecule inhibitors yielded skin darkening in human skin, and mice with decreased NNT function displayed increased pigmentation. Additionally, genetic modification of NNT in zebrafish alters melanocytic pigmentation. Analysis of four diverse human cohorts revealed significant associations of skin color, tanning, and sun protection use with various single-nucleotide polymorphisms within NNT . NNT levels were independent of UVB irradiation and redox modulation. Individuals with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or lentigines displayed decreased skin NNT levels, suggesting an NNT-driven, redox-dependent pigmentation mechanism that can be targeted with NNT-modifying topical drugs for medical and cosmetic purposes.

Section: Introduction

Pigmentation of human skin, which confers protection against skin cancer, evolved over one million years ago in the setting of evolutionary loss of body hair ( Jablonski and Chaplin, 2017 32. Jablonski, N.G. ∙ Chaplin, G. The colours of humanity: the evolution of pigmentation in the human lineage Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 372 :20160349 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human skin color results from relative amounts of yellow-orange pheomelanin and black-brown eumelanin ( Del Bino et al., 2015 19. Del Bino, S. ∙ Ito, S. ∙ Sok, J. ... Chemical analysis of constitutive pigmentation of human epidermis reveals constant eumelanin to pheomelanin ratio Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2015; 28 :707-717 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Darker-pigmented individuals are more protected from oncogenic UV radiation by the light-scattering and antioxidant properties of eumelanin ( Jablonski and Chaplin, 2012 31. Jablonski, N.G. ∙ Chaplin, G. Human skin pigmentation, migration and disease susceptibility Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2012; 367 :785-792 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Pigment dictates how light is absorbed and disseminated in skin ( Pathak et al., 1962 55. Pathak, M.A. ∙ Riley, F.J. ∙ Fitzpatrick, T.B. ... Melanin formation in human skin induced by long-wave ultra-violet and visible light Nature. 1962; 193 :148-150 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). UV light can interact photochemically with DNA to form cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 photoproducts and causes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through multiple mechanisms, increasing the risk of skin cancer ( Premi et al., 2015 57. Premi, S. ∙ Wallisch, S. ∙ Mano, C.M. ... Photochemistry. Chemiexcitation of melanin derivatives induces DNA photoproducts long after UV exposure Science. 2015; 347 :842-847 Crossref Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although eumelanin has antioxidant activity, ROS-mediated oxidation of DNA bases and lipid peroxidation are elevated in mice that produce pheomelanin only ( Mitra et al., 2012 48. Mitra, D. ∙ Luo, X. ∙ Morgan, A. ... An ultraviolet-radiation-independent pathway to melanoma carcinogenesis in the red hair/fair skin background Nature. 2012; 491 :449-453 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Melanocytes produce melanin within subcellular organelles called melanosomes that mature from early, unpigmented (stages I–II) toward late, pigmented states (stages III–IV). Early-stage melanosomes are recognized by proteinaceous fibrils within the melanosomal lumen. In the late stages, melanin is deposited gradually on the fibrils ( Raposo and Marks, 2007 60. Raposo, G. ∙ Marks, M.S. Melanosomes--dark organelles enlighten endosomal membrane transport Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8 :786-797 Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ). These mature melanosomes are ultimately transferred to keratinocytes ( Park et al., 2009 53. Park, H.Y. ∙ Kosmadaki, M. ∙ Yaar, M. ... Cellular mechanisms regulating human melanogenesis Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66 :1493-1506 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ), where they coalesce in a supranuclear location on the sun-facing side. UV radiation triggers tanning through p53-mediated induction of POMC (proopiomelanocortin) peptides in keratinocytes, leading to MC1R activation on melanocytes and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated induction of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor ( MITF ), which induces expression of tyrosinase-related protein 1 and 2 ( TYRP1 and DCT ) ( Lo and Fisher, 2014 45. Lo, J.A. ∙ Fisher, D.E. The melanoma revolution: from UV carcinogenesis to a new era in therapeutics Science. 2014; 346 :945-949 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tyrosinase, which drive melanosome maturation ( Paterson et al., 2015 54. Paterson, E.K. ∙ Fielder, T.J. ∙ MacGregor, G.R. ... Tyrosinase Depletion Prevents the Maturation of Melanosomes in the Mouse Hair Follicle PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0143702 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) and increased production of eumelanin ( Iozumi et al., 1993 28. Iozumi, K. ∙ Hoganson, G.E. ∙ Pennella, R. ... Role of tyrosinase as the determinant of pigmentation in cultured human melanocytes J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100 :806-811 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It regulates mitochondrial redox levels by coupling hydride transfer between β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD(H) and β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2′-phosphate NADP (+) to proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane ( Earle and Fisher, 1980 20.

Even though The Human Protein Atlas ( http://www.proteinatlas.org ; Uhlén et al., 2015 75. Uhlén, M. ∙ Fagerberg, L. ∙ Hallström, B.M. ... Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome Science. 2015; 347 :1260419 Crossref Scopus (9485) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed expression of NNT in human melanocytes, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and other epidermal cells, so far NNT has not been described to be involved in mechanisms of direct regulation of skin pigment. Here we report a role of NNT in modulating melanosome maturation and pigmentation.

Section: Results

NNT was depleted using a pool of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; siNNT) in the human melanoma cell lines UACC257 and SK-MEL-30 and in primary human melanocytes. In all three cell models, knockdown of NNT led to a significant increase in melanin content ( Figures 1 A and S1 A–S1D). The increase in pigmentation following siNNT was blocked by simultaneous knockdown of tyrosinase, demonstrating the dependence of siNNT-mediated pigmentation on tyrosinase ( Figure S1 A).
NNT has been described to increase glutathione (GSH) in Nnt wild-type versus Nnt mutant C57BL/6J mice ( Ronchi et al., 2013 64. Ronchi, J.A. ∙ Figueira, T.R. ∙ Ravagnani, F.G. ... A spontaneous mutation in the nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase gene of C57BL/6J mice results in mitochondrial redox abnormalities Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2013; 63 :446-456 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as in human myocardium ( Sheeran et al., 2010 70. Sheeran, F.L. ∙ Rydström, J. ∙ Shakhparonov, M.I. ... Diminished NADPH transhydrogenase activity and mitochondrial redox regulation in human failing myocardium Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797 :1138-1148 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with this, silencing NNT caused a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio in UACC257 human melanoma cells ( Figure S1 E). Cysteine or reduced GSH is a required component for pheomelanin synthesis ( Ito and IFPCS, 2003 29. Ito, S., IFPCS The IFPCS presidential lecture: a chemist’s view of melanogenesis Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16 :230-236 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jara et al., 1988 34. Jara, J.R. ∙ Aroca, P. ∙ Solano, F. ... The role of sulfhydryl compounds in mammalian melanogenesis: the effect of cysteine and glutathione upon tyrosinase and the intermediates of the pathway Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967 :296-303 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 B, schematic), suggesting that NNT may modulate pigmentation via its role in regenerating GSH and thereby affect the pheomelanin-to-eumelanin ratio. To investigate this possibility, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was utilized and demonstrated significantly increased absolute levels of eumelanin, but not pheomelanin, upon NNT knockdown ( Figure 1 B, left graph). The eumelanin-to-pheomelanin ratio also showed a significant increase ( Figure 1 B, right graph). Tyrosinase silencing was used as a positive control, showing efficient and quick depigmentation 5 days after transfection ( Figure 1 A), resulting in decreased levels of eumelanin and pheomelanin and, as suspected, no significant change in the eumelanin-to-pheomelanin ratio ( Figure S1 F). These data suggest that NNT modulates melanin synthesis toward a eumelanin phenotype.
Because NNT’s essential role as an antioxidant enzyme against ROS by controlling the NADPH conversion, we hypothesized that the increase in pigmentation following silencing of NNT is driven by an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. As expected, knockdown of NNT caused a significant increase in the NADP/NADPH ratio ( Figure S1 E) and induced cytosolic ROS ( Figure S1 G) in UACC257 cells. Adding the thiol antioxidant N -acetylcysteine (NAC), the mitochondrion-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO, or NADPH to siNNT inhibited the siNNT-mediated increase in pigmentation ( Figures 1 C, S1 A, and S1H), demonstrating the dependence of siNNT-mediated pigmentation on oxidative stress.
To understand how cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress levels are connected, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), a source of cytosolic NADPH ( Zhao and McAlister-Henn, 1996 85. Zhao, W.N. ∙ McAlister-Henn, L. Assembly and function of a cytosolic form of NADH-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase in yeast J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :10347-10352 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), was depleted in UACC257 cells ( Figures 1 D, S1 I, and S1J). Interestingly, although siNNT alone increased pigmentation, siIDH1 alone had no significant effect on pigmentation ( Figure 1 D). However, double knockdown of NNT and IDH1 increased the intracellular melanin content further, exceeding the siNNT induction of pigmentation ( Figure 1 D). To exclude the possibility that siIDH1 or siIDH1-induced oxidative stress may increase NNT levels, NNT mRNA levels were measured ( Figures S1 I and S1J), which showed no changes. To understand whether cytosolic ROS may be the driver of the observed pigmentation change, cytosolic oxidative stress was measured upon silencing of siNNT and siIDH1 ( Figure S1 G), showing similar effects of the different siRNAs, emphasizing the crucial role of NNT in human pigmentation.
To clarify the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress, we investigated the participation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α). As shown previously, intramitochondrial concentrations of ROS were increased significantly in PGC1α-depleted melanoma cells, associated with decreased levels of reduced GSH, cystathionine, and 5-adenosylhomocysteine ( Vazquez et al., 2013 77. Vazquez, F. ∙ Lim, J.H. ∙ Chim, H. ... PGC1α expression defines a subset of human melanoma tumors with increased mitochondrial capacity and resistance to oxidative stress Cancer Cell. 2013; 23 :287-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (569) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, no change in pigmentation was detected in PGC1α-depleted human UACC257 melanoma cells ( Figures 1 E and S1 J), emphasizing the specific role of NNT and especially NNT-induced cytosolic oxidative stress in the pigmentation response. Finally, overexpression of NNT in UACC257 cells ( Figure S1 K) increased GSH/GSSG ratios and deceased NADP/NADPH ratios ( Figure S1 L). As opposed to the increase in pigmentation observed with silencing of NNT, overexpression of NNT induced a significant decrease in pigmentation ( Figure 1 F), confirming the relationship between NNT and pigmentation in both directions.
Our data suggest that NNT affects pigmentation via a redox-dependent mechanism.
To elucidate the mechanism underlying hyperpigmentation after NNT knockdown, we investigated its effects on key melanin biosynthesis factors in UACC257 cells ( Figure 2 A). NNT knockdown revealed a significant increase in the levels of the melanin biosynthesis enzymes tyrosinase, TYRP1, and TRP2/DCT ( Figure 2 A). In addition, tyrosinase activity was increased upon silencing of siNNT ( Figure S2 A). Because MITF is the main regulator of these enzymes and the master regulator of melanogenesis ( Figures S2 B–S2G), we measured MITF protein levels and its transcriptional activity. Upon silencing of NNT, neither MITF protein levels nor mRNA levels were changed significantly ( Figures S2 C and S2D). Furthermore, MITF promoter activity was decreased modestly following siNNT ( Figures S2 E and S2F), whereas no significant changes in the mRNA levels of TYRP1, TRP2/DCT, or tyrosinase were observed ( Figures S2 G). This suggests that NNT can affect tyrosinase, TRP2/DCT, and TYRP1 protein levels without affecting their mRNA levels. Because cAMP is a crucial messenger in UV light-induced skin pigmentation (the “classic cAMP-MITF-pigmentation pathway”; Figure S2 B), baseline cAMP levels in siControl- versus siNNT-transfected UACC257 cells were assayed and found to be unaffected by siNNT ( Figure S2 H). Treatment of primary human melanocytes with forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, which increases cAMP levels, did not affect NNT expression levels ( Figure S2 I), nor did UVB irradiation of human skin ( Figure S2 J). In addition, no increase in POMC ( Figure S2 G) or p53 ( Figure S2 K) was observed in UACC257 cells upon siNNT treatment. Modulating the general redox system by adding NAC, MitoTEMPO, or H 2 O 2 did not affect NNT protein levels ( Figure S2 L).
Finally, overexpression of NNT in UACC257 cells showed a significant decrease in tyrosinase protein levels ( Figure S2 M) but not its mRNA levels ( Figure S2 N).
These data suggest the existence of an NNT-dependent pigmentation mechanism independent of the previously established cAMP-MITF-dependent pigmentation pathway.
Because altering NNT was found to affect the protein levels of tyrosinase and related key melanogenic enzymes ( Figure 2 A) without affecting their mRNA levels ( Figure S2 G), we hypothesized that NNT can affect the stability of certain melanosomal proteins. The effect of NNT-mediated redox changes on tyrosinase protein stability was investigated by knockdown of NNT mRNA in the presence or absence of an antioxidant, followed by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) and measurements of the rate of decay of tyrosinase protein. Silencing of NNT significantly increased tyrosinase protein stability, and this effect was prevented by antioxidant treatment with NAC, NADPH, or MitoTEMPO ( Figures 2 B–2D).
The mechanism of tyrosinase degradation is not fully understood, although it has been shown that tyrosinase is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( Bellei et al., 2010 8. Bellei, B. ∙ Maresca, V. ∙ Flori, E. ... p38 regulates pigmentation via proteasomal degradation of tyrosinase J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 :7288-7299 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Addition of carbobenzoxy-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal (MG132), a cell-permeable, reversible proteasome inhibitor, prevented an NNT overexpression-induced decrease in Tyrosinase protein stability in UACC257 cells ( Figure 2 E), suggesting that NNT induces changes in melanin levels through proteasome-mediated degradation of Tyrosinase protein.
Because siNNT-induced increases in melanogenesis enzymes, NNT’s role in NADPH and GSH generation, and its location in the inner mitochondrial membrane, we hypothesized that NNT function might be connected to maturation of melanosomes. The effects of modulating NNT expression on the ultrastructure of melanosomes was assessed by electron microscopy in primary human melanocytes. Knockdown of NNT resulted in a striking increase in late-stage/pigmentated melanosomes (stages III and IV) ( Figures 2 F and S3 A), whereas overexpression of NNT resulted in a switch toward early-stage/unpigmented melanosomes (stages I and II) ( Figure 2 G), establishing a role for NNT in regulating melanosome maturation. In line with the pigmentation data ( Figure 1 C), cotreatment with NAC or MitoTEMPO prevented the siNNT-induced phenotype ( Figures 2 F and S3 A). The absolute number of melanosomes per cytosolic area was not affected by NNT knockdown or overexpression ( Figure S3 B), which is in line with the observation that the pre-melanosome protein Pmel17, a marker for early melanosome development, did not change upon depletion of NNT ( Figure 2 A). Our data suggest that inhibition of NNT drives pigmentation by stabilizing tyrosinase and possibly other tyrosinase-related proteins (TYRP1 and TRP2/DCT) associated with increased melanosome maturation.
Previously, it has been shown that mitochondria are connected with melanosomes via physical contact, requiring Mitofusin-2 (MFN2) ( Daniele et al., 2014 18. Daniele, T. ∙ Hurbain, I. ∙ Vago, R. ... Mitochondria and melanosomes establish physical contacts modulated by Mfn2 and involved in organelle biogenesis Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :393-403 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). The connection between these two organelles may enable localized interorganellar exchange ( Daniele et al., 2014 18. Daniele, T. ∙ Hurbain, I. ∙ Vago, R. ... Mitochondria and melanosomes establish physical contacts modulated by Mfn2 and involved in organelle biogenesis Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :393-403 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu and Hammer, 2014 82. Wu, X. ∙ Hammer, J.A. Melanosome transfer: it is best to give and receive Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 29 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). To understand whether siNNT-induced pigmentation may rely on an equivalent mechanism, we performed simultaneous knockdown of NNT and MFN2 in UACC257 cells ( Figure S3 G) and in human primary melanocytes ( Figure S3 H). Consistent with previous findings ( Daniele et al., 2014 18. Daniele, T. ∙ Hurbain, I. ∙ Vago, R. ... Mitochondria and melanosomes establish physical contacts modulated by Mfn2 and involved in organelle biogenesis Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :393-403 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ), evaluation of mitochondrion-melanosome proximities by electron microscopy confirmed that knockdown of MFN2 resulted in a strong decrease in close appositions (<20 nm) compared with the control ( Figure S3 C). By contrast, silencing of NNT alone lead to a relative increase of organelle contiguities, possibly related to the stimulation of melanogenesis ( Figure S3 C), and double knockdown prevented this increase ( Figure S3 C), whereas melanosome and mitochondrion numbers remained unchanged ( Figures S3 D and S3E). Similar to melanosome-mitochondrion proximity, silencing of NNT in UACC257 human melanoma cells significantly increased the intracellular melanin content, which was reversed by simultaneous knockdown of NNT and MFN2 ( Figure S3 F). Finally, overexpression of NNT resulted in a decrease in close appositions (<20 nm) compared with the control ( Figure S3 C), whereas no change was observed in melanosome and mitochondrion numbers ( Figures S3 B and S3E).
Although these findings suggest that MFN2 and melanosome-mitochondrion proximity may contribute to NNT regulation of pigmentation changes, the role of MFN2 in melanogenesis is complex. In addition to interorganellar connections, MFN2 regulates many functions in cells, including mitochondrial fusion, ATP production, and autophagy, that may affect pigmentation ( Filadi et al., 2018 21. Filadi, R. ∙ Pendin, D. ∙ Pizzo, P. Mitofusin 2: from functions to disease Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :330 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, MFN2 deficiency has been associated with impaired autophagic degradation and accumulation of autophagosomes ( Zhao et al., 2012 86. Zhao, T. ∙ Huang, X. ∙ Han, L. ... Central role of mitofusin 2 in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiomyocytes J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :23615-23625 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sebastián et al., 2016 69. Sebastián, D. ∙ Sorianello, E. ∙ Segalés, J. ... Mfn2 deficiency links age-related sarcopenia and impaired autophagy to activation of an adaptive mitophagy pathway EMBO J. 2016; 35 :1677-1693 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with those findings, knockdown of MFN2 in human primary melanocytes and UACC257 cells resulted in the presence of large autophagosome-like structures containing numerous and partly intact melanosomes ( Figure S3 I) as well as increased LCB3 type II ( Figure S3 J), which can be associated with enhanced autophagosome synthesis or reduced autophagosome degradation ( Barth et al., 2010 7. Barth, S. ∙ Glick, D. ∙ Macleod, K.F. Autophagy: assays and artifacts J. Pathol. 2010; 221 :117-124 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because defects in autophagosome formation and turnover interfere with melanosome biogenesis and are associated with pigmentary defects ( Ho and Ganesan, 2011 22. Ho, H. ∙ Ganesan, A.K. The pleiotropic roles of autophagy regulators in melanogenesis Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2011; 24 :595-604 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), we conclude that MFN2 can regulate pigmentation via distinct but incompletely understood pathways.
Currently, only a few topical drugs are capable of altering pigmentation in human skin ( Rendon and Gaviria, 2005 61. Rendon, M.I. ∙ Gaviria, J.I. Review of skin-lightening agents Dermatologic Surgery. 2005; 31 :886-889 discussion 889 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). No topical skin darkeners are available for clinical use. Systemic administration of peptides, such as α-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) analogs (e.g., melanotan), has been used to successfully increase skin pigmentation ( Ugwu et al., 1997 74. Ugwu, S.O. ∙ Blanchard, J. ∙ Dorr, R.T. ... Skin pigmentation and pharmacokinetics of melanotan-I in humans Biopharm. Drug Dispos. 1997; 18 :259-269 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three NNT inhibitors ( N,N’ -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide [DCC], 2,3-butanedione [2,3BD], and palmitoyl-coenzyme A [CoA]) have been described previously ( Figure S4 A; Rydström, 1972 65. Rydström, J. Site-specific inhibitors of mitochondrial nicotinamide-nucleotide transhydrogenase Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31 :496-504 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). DCC is commonly used as a peptide-coupling reagent, and 2,3BD is used as a flavoring agent ( Rigler and Longo, 2010 62. Rigler, M.W. ∙ Longo, W.E. Emission of diacetyl (2,3 butanedione) from natural butter, microwave popcorn butter flavor powder, paste, and liquid products Int. J. Occup. Environ. Health. 2010; 16 :291-302 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both are low-molecular-weight compounds (DCC, 206.33 g/mol; 2,3BD, 86.09 g/mol) potentially capable of penetrating the human epidermis. Palmitoyl-CoA, like 2,3BD, is a natural product but has a high molecular weight (1005.94 g/mol), making skin penetration challenging. The effects of all three compounds on pigmentation of intermediately pigmented murine Melan-A cells ( Figure 3 A) were assessed. 2,3BD and DCC significantly increased the melanin content in intermediately pigmented murine Melan-A cells ( Figure 3 A) and in human primary melanocytes ( Figure S4 D). In vitro toxicity was assessed in primary human melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and keratinocytes ( Figure S4 B and S4C), showing no significant toxicity in doses up to 10 μM, -. To verify the effects of the small-molecular-weight compounds on NNT function, the GSH/GSSG ratio, an indirect endpoint of NNT enzyme activity, was measured, revealing decreased GSH/GSSG ratios induced by DCC and 2,3BD in primary melanocytes ( Figures 3 B and 3C) and by DCC in UACC257 melanoma cells ( Figure S4 E) without significant toxicity ( Figures S4 C and S4E). Treatment of primary human melanocytes with siNNT or 2,3BD significantly increased the intracellular melanin content, but simultaneous treatment with siNNT and 2,3 BD did not further increase the melanin ( Figure S4 D), suggesting that enhancement of pigmentation by 2,3BD may be mediated by inhibition of NNT.
Next we tested the compounds on human skin explants from different skin types. As suggested above, palmitoyl-CoA did not penetrate the epidermis and had no effect on pigmentation (data not shown). In abdominal skin from individuals of fair skin (phototype 1–2), 2,3BD yielded strong induction of pigmentation at relatively high doses ( Figure 3 D). Histology with Fontana-Masson staining showed increased melanin in 2,3BD-treated skin ( Figures 3 Ei and S4 F) and no obvious cell damage or inflammation by H&E staining ( Figure 3 Eii), although the volatility of 2,3BD produces a strong butter-like aroma, potentially limiting its future clinical use. Importantly, keratinocytic supranuclear caps ( Figures 3 Eiii and S4 F) were present, suggesting formation of functional melanosome/melanin transfer to keratinocytes, which allows cells to protect their nuclei from UV radiation. Daily application of 50 mM 2,3BD or DCC on skin from intermediately pigmented (type 3–4) individuals yielded significantly increased pigmentation after 5 days ( Figure 3 F). Because of the activity of DCC as a coupling agent and its corresponding unclear toxicity risks, only 2,3BD was used in subsequent experiments.
UV radiation interacting with DNA can directly produce CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts, whereas ROS-mediated DNA modifications produce alternative nucleotide adducts, including 8,5-cyclo-2-deoxyadenosine, 8,5-cyclo-2-deoxyguanosine, and 8-oxo-deoxyguanine ( Jaruga and Dizdaroglu, 2008 35. Jaruga, P. ∙ Dizdaroglu, M. 8,5′-Cyclopurine-2′-deoxynucleosides in DNA: mechanisms of formation, measurement, repair and biological effects DNA Repair (Amst.). 2008; 7 :1413-1425 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang, 2008 80.

Although superficial epidermal cells containing modified proteins, lipids, and DNA are shed continuously through corneocyte desquamation, durable basal cells require active DNA repair machinery for their maintenance. Melanomas have been found to contain high frequencies of somatic mutations with characteristic UV-induced signatures of C-to-T and G-to-A transitions ( Berger et al., 2012 11. Berger, M.F. ∙ Hodis, E. ∙ Heffernan, T.P. ... Melanoma genome sequencing reveals frequent PREX2 mutations Nature. 2012; 485 :502-506 Crossref Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). Protecting human skin from these intermediates is a major goal of skin cancer prevention strategies. As shown in previous studies, increased pigmentation can help to protect against CPD formation ( D’Orazio et al., 2006 17. D’Orazio, J.A. ∙ Nobuhisa, T. ∙ Cui, R. ... Topical drug rescue strategy and skin protection based on the role of Mc1r in UV-induced tanning Nature. 2006; 443 :340-344 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mujahid et al., 2017 51.

A UV-Independent Topical Small-Molecule Approach for Melanin Production in Human Skin Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :2177-2184 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested whether 2,3BD-induced pigmentation can protect skin from UVB-induced CPD formation. After inducing a visible increase in pigmentation of human skin by application of 50 mM 2,3BD to skin type 2–3 for 5 days ( Figure 3 G), UVB was applied, and CPD formation was detected by immunofluorescence staining and normalized to the total number of cells. It was observed that 2,3BD treatment protected against formation of UVB-induced CPD ( Figure 3 G). We then measured γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA double-stranded breaks, to investigate potential 2,3BD-mediated toxicity as well as whether 2,3BD-mediated skin pigmentation could protect from UVB-induced γ-H2AX induction ( Figure 3 H). 2,3BD was observed to be non-toxic, and the pigmentation it produced could protect human skin from UVB-induced γ-H2AX induction.
C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ mice are substrains of the C57BL/6 mouse with known genetic differences. Although C57BL/6NJ mice are homozygous for the Nnt wild-type allele, C57BL/6J mice are homozygous for the NntC57BL/6J mutation. This mutant allele is missing a stretch of 17,814 bp between exons 6 and 12, resulting in a lack of mature protein in these mutants ( Toye et al., 2005 72. Toye, A.A. ∙ Lippiat, J.D. ∙ Proks, P. ... A genetic and physiological study of impaired glucose homeostasis control in C57BL/6J mice Diabetologia. 2005; 48 :675-686 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ; Huang et al., 2006 25. Huang, T.T. ∙ Naeemuddin, M. ∙ Elchuri, S. ... Genetic modifiers of the phenotype of mice deficient in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15 :1187-1194 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our experiments, C57BL/6J mice that are homozygous for the Nnt mutation ( Figure S5 A) showed increased fur pigmentation compared with C57BL6/NJ control (wild-type Nnt ) mice ( Figure 4 A, left panel). Quantification of pheomelanin and eumelanin levels in mouse hair by HPLC shows higher eumelanin, but not pheomelanin, in C57BL/6J mice compared with C57BL/6NJ mice ( Figure 4 A).
Next, a zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) model that selectively overexpresses NNT in melanocytes was engineered. Similar to humans and mice, zebrafish melanocytes originate from the neural crest, and the pathways leading to melanocyte differentiation and pigment production are conserved. Many human pigmentation genes and disorders have been modeled successfully in zebrafish, highlighting the striking similarity between zebrafish and human melanocytes. Unlike humans, zebrafish have xanthophore and iridophore pigmentation cells, but in this manuscript we restrict our studies to melanocytes ( van Rooijen et al., 2017 76. van Rooijen, E. ∙ Fazio, M. ∙ Zon, L.I. From fish bowl to bedside: The power of zebrafish to unravel melanoma pathogenesis and discover new therapeutics Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2017; 30 :402-412 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Five days after NNT overexpression, a decrease in intramelanocytic pigmentation was observed in NNT-overexpressing zebrafish compared with empty-plasmid zebrafish embryos ( Figure 4 B). This observation was confirmed by pixel-based brightness quantification analysis. Deletion of nnt using CRISPR-Cas9 ( Figure S5 B) resulted in darkened melanocytes ( Figure 4 C). Similar to genetic deletion of nnt , treatment of zebrafish embryos for 24 h with chemical NNT inhibitors (DCC and 2,3BD), resulted in significant darkening ( Figure 4 D). However, subsequent treatment of NNT-overexpressing fish with 2,3BD prevented the NNT overexpression [OE]-induced decrease in melanocytic pigmentation ( Figure S5 C). This finding is in line with previous publications confirming an inhibitory role 2,3BD and DCC on NNT enzyme activity ( Phelps and Hatefi, 1981 56. Phelps, D.C. ∙ Hatefi, Y. Inhibition of the mitochondrial nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and diethylpyrocarbonate J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256 :8217-8221 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moody and Reid, 1983 49. Moody, A.J. ∙ Reid, R.A. Inhibition of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase in rat liver submitochondrial particles by dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide and butanedione Biochem. J. 1983; 209 :889-892 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next we examined the status of NNT in human hyperpigmentation disorders, including postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and lentigo. Skin biopsies of nine Asian individuals were co-stained for NNT and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) immunofluorescence. NNT intensity was normalized to the sample’s DAPI intensity and cell count. Epidermal and upper dermal skin were investigated. In line with the Human Protein Atlas, NNT is expressed in different epidermal cells, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and melanocytes ( Uhlén et al., 2015 75. Uhlén, M. ∙ Fagerberg, L. ∙ Hallström, B.M. ... Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome Science. 2015; 347 :1260419 Crossref Scopus (9485) PubMed Google Scholar ), moderate levels of NNT expression (red) were detected throughout the epidermis and upper dermis ( Figure 4 E, left panels). Although non-inflammatory skin disorders, such as ABNOM (acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules, also known as Hori’s nevus), displayed NNT expression levels similar to those of healthy skin (data not shown), skin of individuals with inflammation-induced disorders displayed decreased NNT expression levels. Disorders where intrinsic inflammation was present, such as PIH, or where extrinsic inflammation was present, such as UV-induced lentigo, NNT expression was significantly lower compared with healthy skin ( Figure 4 E, center and right panels). Interestingly, this trend was enhanced in areas of hyperpigmentation ( Figure S5 D).
Thus, NNT levels appear to be associated with murine and zebrafish pigmentation as well as human disorders of hyperpigmentation.
To investigate whether NNT plays a role in normal skin pigmentation variation in humans, we examined associations between pigmentation and genetic variants within the ∼1.1-Mb NNT gene region. A meta-analysis was performed to combine p values from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted in 4 diverse population cohorts with a total of 462,885 individuals: two Western European cohorts (Rotterdam Study [ Jacobs et al., 2015 33. Jacobs, L.C. ∙ Hamer, M.A. ∙ Verkouteren, J.A. ... Perceived skin colour seems a swift, valid and reliable measurement Br. J. Dermatol. 2015; 173 :1084-1086 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ] and UK Biobank [ Hysi et al., 2018 26. Hysi, P.G. ∙ Valdes, A.M. ∙ Liu, F. ..., International Visible Trait Genetics Consortium Genome-wide association meta-analysis of individuals of European ancestry identifies new loci explaining a substantial fraction of hair color variation and heritability Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :652-656 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ; Loh et al., 2018 46. Loh, P.R. ∙ Kichaev, G. ∙ Gazal, S. ... Mixed-model association for biobank-scale datasets Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :906-908 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ]), a multi-ethnic Latin American cohort (CANDELA; Adhikari et al., 2019 3. Adhikari, K. ∙ Mendoza-Revilla, J. ∙ Sohail, A. ... A GWAS in Latin Americans highlights the convergent evolution of lighter skin pigmentation in Eurasia Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :358 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a multi-ethnic cohort from eastern and southern Africa ( Crawford et al., 2017 15. Crawford, N.G. ∙ Kelly, D.E. ∙ Hansen, M.E.B. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Loci associated with skin pigmentation identified in African populations Science. 2017; 358 :eaan8433 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). In these studies, skin pigmentation was measured quantitatively by reflectometry or by an ordinal system ( STAR Methods ). UK Biobank summary statistics were also available for ease of skin tanning (sunburn) and use of sun protection.
332 variants were available in the combined dataset; using a p value significance threshold of 1.01E−3 (adjusted for multiple testing; STAR Methods ), 11 variants were significantly associated with skin pigmentation in the meta-analysis ( Figure 5 A; Table S1 ). The variants were present in all worldwide populations, with the alternative alleles having the highest frequency in Africans ( Table S1 ; Figure 6 A) and being associated with darker skin color. The strongest association (p = 4.94E−05) was observed for an intronic variant, rs561686035.
It was also the strongest associated variant for sun protection use in the UK Biobank cohort (p = 4.15E−04; Figure 5 B), with the minor allele being associated with increased use. The UK Biobank cohort also showed a significant association with ease of skin tanning (sunburn), with the lowest p value being 1E−3 for the intronic SNP rs62367652 and the minor allele being associated with increased tanning ( Figures 5 B and S6 B).
All 11 variants that were significant in the meta-analysis of pigmentation are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r 2 > 0.7), and they span an 11-kb region at the beginning of the NNT gene overlapping its promoter (ENSR00000180214) ( Figure 5 A), which shows regulatory activity in melanocytes and keratinocytes (according to the Ensembl database; Table S1 ). Furthermore, several of these variants are highly significant eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) for the NNT gene in sun-exposed and unexposed skin tissue (according to the genotype-tissue expression project [GTEx] database; Table S1 ). For these variants, the alternative alleles correlated with darker skin color and had negative effect sizes as eQTLs for NNT expression ( Table S1 ), indicating lower levels of expression of the NNT transcript.
Subsequently, we sought to understand the direction of effect of the NNT genetic variants on these traits and on expression of NNT. We calculated the correlation between the GWAS effect sizes of the alternative allele of each genetic variant within the NNT region with their effect sizes as eQTLs on expression of the NNT transcript according to GTEx in the two skin tissues ( STAR Methods ). The results are consistent with the direction of association between NNT transcript expression and skin color as described earlier; expression levels of the NNT transcript in both tissues was negatively correlated ( Table S2 ) with darker skin color (especially in sun-unexposed skin tissue, where the effect of external factors such as sunlight is less prominent) and sun protection use (especially in sun-exposed skin tissue) as well as sunburn (especially in sun-exposed skin tissue).
Therefore, several intronic SNPs within the NNT genomic region were associated with skin pigmentation, tanning, and sun protection use in 4 diverse cohorts including 462,885 individuals. Using eQTL expression data for NNT , we observed that lower expression of the NNT transcript in skin tissues correlates with darker skin color and, consequently, less sunburn and less sun protection use.
Because MC1R is a major determinant of pigmentation, with known genetic variants associated with lighter skin color, red hair, and freckles in European populations ( Quillen et al., 2019 59. Quillen, E.E. ∙ Norton, H.L. ∙ Parra, E.J. ... Shades of complexity: New perspectives on the evolution and genetic architecture of human skin Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 2019; 168 :4-26 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), we checked whether MC1R can be a confounder in the observed association of NNT with skin pigmentation. In the Western European cohort of the Rotterdam Study, conditioning on the three known MC1R SNPs in the GWAS did not significantly alter the p values of the NNT variants ((p = 0.869; Figure 6 B). Conditioning on a larger set of known pigmentation variants ( STAR Methods ) in the GWAS does not significantly alter the p values of the NNT variants (p = 0.191; Figure 6 C) either.

Section: Discussion

This study addresses the question of how redox metabolism interplays with skin pigmentation. It identifies (1) the existence of a distinct redox-dependent, UV- and MITF-independent skin pigmentation mechanism; (2) a role of the mitochondrial redox-regulating enzyme NNT in altering pigmentation by regulating tyrosinase protein stability and melanosome maturation via a redox-dependent mechanism; and (3) a class of topical NNT inhibitors that yield skin darkening ( Martin et al., 2017 47. Martin, A.R. ∙ Lin, M. ∙ Granka, J.M. ... An Unexpectedly Complex Architecture for Skin Pigmentation in Africans Cell. 2017; 171 :1340-1353.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ).
SLC24A5 was the first gene to be identified as associated with light skin color in Europeans ( Lamason et al., 2005 41. Lamason, R.L. ∙ Mohideen, M.A. ∙ Mest, J.R. ... SLC24A5, a putative cation exchanger, affects pigmentation in zebrafish and humans Science. 2005; 310 :1782-1786 Crossref Scopus (851) PubMed Google Scholar ). GWAS in non-Europeans ( Arjinpathana and Asawanonda, 2012 5. Arjinpathana, N. ∙ Asawanonda, P. Glutathione as an oral whitening agent: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study J. Dermatolog. Treat. 2012; 23 :97-102 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ; Crawford et al., 2017 15.

An Unexpectedly Complex Architecture for Skin Pigmentation in Africans Cell. 2017; 171 :1340-1353.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) emphasized the complex nature of human skin pigmentation. In addition to certain key regulators such as TYR and MITF , many other genes may affect skin pigmentation and an individual’s skin color. It is thus plausible that factors involved in redox metabolism, such as NNT, may be responsive to environmental changes such as UV exposure or inflammation. Increasing eumelanin levels as a response to ROS-inducing events might have been beneficial during evolution by maintaining cutaneous redox equilibrium. An interplay between oxidative stress and skin pigmentation has been suspected ( Arjinpathana and Asawanonda, 2012 5. Arjinpathana, N. ∙ Asawanonda, P. Glutathione as an oral whitening agent: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study J. Dermatolog. Treat. 2012; 23 :97-102 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the exact mechanism and ways to potentially target this pathway are incompletely elucidated.
From a clinical perspective, our findings are relevant because of the prevalence of pigmentary disorders, which are among the most common reasons for dermatological consultations ( Cestari et al., 2014 13. Cestari, T.F. ∙ Dantas, L.P. ∙ Boza, J.C. Acquired hyperpigmentations An. Bras. Dermatol. 2014; 89 :11-25 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, lightly pigmented individuals have increased risk of melanoma, a life-threatening disease.
As shown previously ( D’Orazio et al., 2006 17. D’Orazio, J.A. ∙ Nobuhisa, T. ∙ Cui, R. ... Topical drug rescue strategy and skin protection based on the role of Mc1r in UV-induced tanning Nature. 2006; 443 :340-344 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mujahid et al., 2017 51. Mujahid, N. ∙ Liang, Y. ∙ Murakami, R. ... A UV-Independent Topical Small-Molecule Approach for Melanin Production in Human Skin Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :2177-2184 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), skin pigmentation, and especially high eumelanin levels, can protect human skin from UVB-induced CPD formation. Most probably, this effect relates to eumelanin-mediated absorbance of UV light and a buffering function of eumelanin toward oxidative stress radicals. Different approaches for increasing pigmentation have been tried so far, including topical use of the cAMP agonist forskolin ( D’Orazio et al., 2006 17. D’Orazio, J.A. ∙ Nobuhisa, T. ∙ Cui, R. ... Topical drug rescue strategy and skin protection based on the role of Mc1r in UV-induced tanning Nature. 2006; 443 :340-344 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ), which worked well in mice but does not sufficiently penetrate human skin. Afamelanotide, an α-MSH analog, has been used for treating erythropoietic protoporphyria by producing hyperpigmentation that is able to protect skin against UV light-induced photosensitivity ( Langendonk et al., 2015 42. Langendonk, J.G. ∙ Balwani, M. ∙ Anderson, K.E. ... Afamelanotide for Erythropoietic Protoporphyria N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373 :48-59 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). Topical administration of SIK inhibitors preclinically also induced pigmentation ( Horike et al., 2010 24. Horike, N. ∙ Kumagai, A. ∙ Shimono, Y. ... Downregulation of SIK2 expression promotes the melanogenic program in mice Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2010; 23 :809-819 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mujahid et al., 2017 51. Mujahid, N. ∙ Liang, Y. ∙ Murakami, R. ... A UV-Independent Topical Small-Molecule Approach for Melanin Production in Human Skin Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :2177-2184 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because MITF is a transcription factor involved in numerous melanocyte functions, transiently targeting pigmentation via NNT inhibition is a distinct and potentially complementary approach that might have applications in contexts such as pigmentation disorders and skin cancer prevention.
In this report, we present evidence of the existence of a redox-dependent skin pigmentation pathway. In contrast to the established classic UVB-cAMP-MITF-dependent tanning pathway, this mechanism is independent of UV irradiation, MITF, and MITF signaling effects. Instead, a distinct pigmentation mechanism dependent on ROS is described, demonstrating how oxidative stress affects pigmentation in cells of melanocytic origin by modifying GSH, NADPH, increasing tyrosinase protein stability, tyrosinase-related proteins, and melanosome maturation. Evaluating the interplay between other pigmentation mechanisms, such as immediate and persistent pigment darkening, as well as understanding the safety, penetration, and efficacy of topical NNT modifiers may be worthy of study in future clinical settings.
In this proof-of-principle study, the effect of NNT on pigmentation has been shown. However, there are several limitations: (1) Although this study used previously identified NNT-inhibiting compounds, further research is needed to identify more specific compounds for modulating NNT enzyme activity. We believe caution is warranted when modulating cutaneous redox biology and skin pigmentation, requiring careful attention before human application. (2) We used the NntC57BL/6J mouse model, which is homozygous for the NntC57BL/6J mutation and lack a stretch of 17,814 bp between exons 6 and 12, resulting in a lack of mature NNT protein. Because this mutation also affects the function of other proteins, use of this model alone cannot confirm NNT’s role in pigmentation. (3) The statistical association analyses identify a correlation between SNPs within NNT and human pigmentation variation. Although some of the associated SNPs are located within the promoter region of the NNT gene and are eQTLs for NNT expression, further biological experiments are needed to confirm causality. (4) Although zebrafish melanocyte function and melanin biosynthesis are similar to humans because many genes are shared, the contribution of other fish-specific cell types to melanocyte biology is incompletely understood. The MiniCoopR rescue system employed in this study overexpresses human NNT potentially at above physiological levels. This seems to cause slight toxicity to melanocytes, which resulted in lower melanocyte rescue. Additionally, because of technical variability in single-cell injection efficiency, variations in the number and location of melanocytes per fish were observed.

Mice studies and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital and were conducted strictly in accordance with the approved animal handling protocol. Zebrafish experiments performed in this study were in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal research protocol, including zebrafish maintenance and euthanasia was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Boston Children’s Hospital.
All mice were bred on a heterozygous MiWhite background ( Mitf white) ( Steingrímsson et al., 2004 71. Steingrímsson, E. ∙ Copeland, N.G. ∙ Jenkins, N.A. Melanocytes and the microphthalmia transcription factor network Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38 :365-411 Crossref Scopus (651) PubMed Google Scholar ). C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 000664) displaying a 5-exon deletion in the Nnt gene resulting in a homozygous loss were compared to Nnt wild-type C57BL/6NJ mice (Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 005304). All mice were matched by gender and age (female, 6 weeks old). Mice were genotyped according to the protocol obtained from Jackson Laboratory (protocol 26539: Standard PCR Assay - Nnt < C57BL/6J >, Version 2.2).
The human NNT gene was cloned into the MiniCoopR expression plasmid to allow melanocyte-specific overexpression of NNT ( Ceol et al., 2011 12. Ceol, C.J. ∙ Houvras, Y. ∙ Jane-Valbuena, J. ... The histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is recurrently amplified in melanoma and accelerates its onset Nature. 2011; 471 :513-517 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MiniCoopR plasmid contains an mitf mini-gene alongside mitfa driven NNT or an empty control. Casper zebrafish ( mitfa −/−; roy −/−) embryos ( Ablain et al., 2015 2. Ablain, J. ∙ Durand, E.M. ∙ Yang, S. ... A CRISPR/Cas9 vector system for tissue-specific gene disruption in zebrafish Dev. Cell. 2015; 32 :756-764 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ) were injected at the single cell stage with plasmid DNA, which gets incorporated into the genome though Tol2 transgenesis. This results in the rescue of melanocytes via the mitfa minigene and melanocyte-specific overexpression of NNT . Larvae were raised for 5 days and imaged using a Nikon SMZ18 Stereomicroscope.
SpCas9 guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to target the first two exons of the zebrafish nnt gene using on-target and off-target prediction software ( Table S3 ). gRNA expression plasmids were constructed by cloning oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) into BseRI-digested pMiniCoopR-U6:gRNA-mitfa:Cas9 (Addgene plasmid ID 118840) ( Ablain et al., 2015 2.

Cell. 2015; 32 :756-764 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). A control CRISPR MiniCoopR plasmid was generated by cloning a scrambled gRNA into the CRISPR MiniCoopR vector. The CRISPR MiniCoopR plasmid contains an mitf mini-gene alongside mitfa:Cas9 and U6:gRNA. Casper zebrafish ( mitfa −/−; roy −/−) embryos ( Ablain et al., 2015 2.

Cell. 2015; 32 :756-764 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ) were injected at the single cell stage with plasmid DNA, which gets incorporated into the genome though Tol2 transgenesis. This results in the rescue of melanocytes via the mitfa minigene and melanocyte-specific knockout of nnt . Larvae were raised for 4 days and imaged using a Nikon SMZ18 Stereomicroscope.
DNA was extracted from the embryos at 4 days post fertilization using the Hot Shot method ( Truett et al., 2000 73. Truett, G.E. ∙ Heeger, P. ∙ Mynatt, R.L. ... Preparation of PCR-quality mouse genomic DNA with hot sodium hydroxide and tris (HotSHOT) Biotechniques. 2000; 29 :52-54 Crossref Scopus (1223) PubMed Google Scholar ), for analysis of genome editing. The efficiency of genome modification by SpCas9 was determined by next-generation sequencing using a 2-step PCR-based Illumina library construction method, as previously described ( Walton et al., 2020 79. Walton, R.T. ∙ Christie, K.A. ∙ Whittaker, M.N. ... Unconstrained genome targeting with near-PAMless engineered CRISPR-Cas9 variants Science. 2020; 368 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (711) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, genomic loci were amplified from gDNA extracted from pooled samples of 8-10 zebrafish embryos using Q5 High-fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, # M0491S) with the primers listed in Table S3 . PCR products were purified using paramagnetic beads prepared as previously described ( Rohland and Reich, 2012 63. Rohland, N. ∙ Reich, D. Cost-effective, high-throughput DNA sequencing libraries for multiplexed target capture Genome Res. 2012; 22 :939-946 Crossref Scopus (738) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kleinstiver et al., 2019 39. Kleinstiver, B.P. ∙ Sousa, A.A. ∙ Walton, R.T. ... Engineered CRISPR-Cas12a variants with increased activities and improved targeting ranges for gene, epigenetic and base editing Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :276-282 Crossref Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ). Approximately 20 ng of purified PCR product was used as template for a second PCR to add Illumina barcodes and adaptor sequences using Q5 and the primers ( Table S3 ). PCR products were purified prior to quantification via capillary electrophoresis (QIAGEN QIAxcel), followed by normalization and pooling. Final libraries were quantified by qPCR using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche, #7960140001) and sequenced on a MiSeq sequencer using a 300-cycle v2 kit (Illumina, #MS-102-2002). Genome editing activities were determined from the sequencing data using CRISPResso2 ( Clement et al., 2019 14. Clement, K. ∙ Rees, H. ∙ Canver, M.C. ... CRISPResso2 provides accurate and rapid genome editing sequence analysis Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :224-226 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters.
Wild-type Tübingen zebrafish ( Figure 4 D) or mcr:NNT or mcr:Empty rescued Casper Zebrafish ( Figure S5 C) were placed in a 24 well plate at 72 hours post-fertilization, with 10 larvae per well for a total twenty larvae per condition. Larvae were treated for 24 hours with either 2,3BD (1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM; Sigma Aldrich, #B85307), DCC (1 μM, 10 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM; Sigma Aldrich, #D80002), or DMSO (1:500) in E3 embryo medium. At 4 days post fertilization, larvae were imaged using a Nikon SMZ18 Stereomicroscope. At least 57 melanocytes from 18 zebrafish embryos were analyzed using the FIJI software enabling pixel-based color quantification.
Pigmentation of free-standing melanocytes were identified at high magnification, making sure no overlapping signal was included into the analysis. The intra-melanocytic region was marked and the brightness was measured using the FIJI software. The measured output is the mean pixel intensity of the measured region ( = melanocyte), which was plotted as one dot in the graph displayed.
Skin samples considered surgical waste were obtained de-identified from healthy donors (IRB# 2013P000093) undergoing reconstructive surgery, according to institutional regulations. Full thickness human abdominal skin explants were cultured in Petri dishes with a solid phase and liquid phase phenol red free DMEM medium containing 20% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, 5% fungizone (GIBCO), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Explants were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 2,3BD (50 mM, 1 M, or 11 M;) or DCC (50 mM) as indicated in the figure legends. Compounds were applied strictly on top of the explants, making sure no drip occurred into the underlying media. For UV irradiation experiments, a UV lamp (UV Products) was used at 1000 mJ/cm 2 UVB.

FLAG-tagged human NNT cDNA (NNT-FLAG) was purchased from Origene (RC224002). The NNT-FLAG cassette was re-cloned into pLJM1-EGFP (Addgene #19319) following NheI and EcoRI digestion.
Lentivirus was generated in Lenti-X 293T cells (Clontech, #632180). The Lenti-X cells were transfected using 250 ng pMD2.G, 1250 ng psPAX2, and 1250 ng lentiviral expression vector in the presence of PEI (MW:25K). For infection with lentivirus, 0.1–1 mL of lentivirus-containing medium was used in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma, #TR-1003). Selection with puromycin (10 μg/ml) was performed the day after infection.
2,3-Butanedione 97% (2,3 BD) (Sigma Aldrich, #B85307) (1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM, 2 mM), N,N-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Sigma Aldrich, #D80002) (1 mM, 2 mM, 10 mM), and Palmitoyl coenzyme A lithium salt (Sigma Aldrich, #P9716) (10 μM, 2 mM) were reconstituted with DMSO (American Type Culture Collection, 4-X).
Whole-cell protein lysates were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, #R0278) supplemented with Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific, #PI78445). Protein concentrations were quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, #23225). Immunoblotting was performed by standard techniques using 4%–15% Criterion TGX Precast Midi Protein gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, #5671084) and transferring to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, #1620112). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk (Boston BioProducts, #P-1400) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 100 and incubated with one of the following primary antibodies at the indicated dilution (antibody sources are in the Key resources table ): 1:20 dilution of anti-MITF monoclonal antibody C5, 1:1,000 dilution of anti-Tyrosinase clone T311, 1:1,000 dilution of anti- Mitofusin-2 antibody [6A8], 1:500 dilution of TRP2/DCT antibody, 1:1,000 dilution of anti-NNT antibody [8B4BB10], 1:1,000 dilution of anti-IDH1 (D2H1) antibody, 1:1,000 dilution of p53 antibody [PAb 240], 1:1,000 dilution of TYRP1 antibody [EPR21960], 1:1,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody Pmel17 (E-7), or 1:1,000 dilution of LC3B (D11) rabbit monoclonal antibody. Incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody followed, either a 1:5,000 dilution of donkey anti-Rabbit IgG-HRP or a 1:3,000 dilution of Amersham ECL mouse IgG, HRP.
To verify equal loading of samples, membranes were re-probed with a 1:20,000 dilution of monoclonal anti-β-actin-peroxidase (Sigma Aldrich, #A3854). Protein bands were visualized using Western Lightning Plus ECL (PerkinElmer, #NEL105001EA) and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH).
Total RNA was isolated from cultured primary melanocytes or melanoma cells at the indicated time points, using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN, #74136). mRNA expression was determined using intron-spanning primers with SYBR FAST qPCR master mix (Kapa Biosystems, #KK4600).

72 h after siRNA transfection (siControl or siNNT), UACC257 melanoma cells were treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cyclohexamide (CHX, Sigma Aldrich #C7698, 50 μg/ml), for the indicated times and then immediately subjected to immunoblotting for tyrosinase protein expression. The expression of tyrosinase was quantified using ImageJ software based on band intensities and normalized to the intensities of the corresponding β-actin bands. The normalized tyrosinase expression was then defined as relative tyrosinase expression by setting the mean values at t = 0 in each experimental group to 1.0.
In the ROS rescue experiments, siRNA-containing medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC; Sigma Aldrich #A7250, 5 mM), β-nicontinamide adenine dinucleotide 2′-phosphate (NADPH; Sigma Aldrich #N7505, 0.1 mM), MitoTEMPO (ThermoFisher #501872447, 20 μM) or control vehicle (DMSO or TrisHCl respectively) 24h after siRNA transfection. The siRNA-transfected cells were cultured for an additional 48 h in the presence of these agents and then examined by the CHX chase assay as described above.
pLJM-1-EGFP or pLJM1-NNT/FLAG was introduced into UACC257 cells using Lipofectamine 3000. 48 after transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium containing DMSO or 10 μM MG132 (Sigma Aldrich #M8699) and pre-incubated for 6 h. Then, CHX was added to assess tyrosinase protein stability as described above.
Equal numbers of cells were plated in 6-well plates. The cells were then harvested 72 – 96 hours post siRNA or NNT inhibitors compounds, as indicated in the legends, pelleted, washed in PBS and counted. 10 6 cells were used for measurement of protein concentration with the Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23225) and 10 6 cells were resuspended in 60 μL of 1 N NaOH solution and incubated at 60°C for 2 h or until the melanin was completely dissolved. After cooling down to room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min and the supernatants were loaded onto a 96-well plate. The melanin content was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm on an Envision plate reader, compared with a melanin standard (0 to 50 μg/ml; Sigma Aldrich, #M8631). Melanin content was expressed as micrograms per milligram of protein.
Lyophilized cells (1 × 10 6 ) from human abdominal full thickness skin explants were ultrasonicated in 400 μL of water and fur samples were homogenized at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in water in a Ten-Broeck homogenizer. Aliquots of 100 μL were subjected to alkaline hydrogen peroxide oxidation to yield the eumelanin marker, pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) ( Ito et al., 2011 30. Ito, S. ∙ Nakanishi, Y. ∙ Valenzuela, R.K. ... Usefulness of alkaline hydrogen peroxide oxidation to analyze eumelanin and pheomelanin in various tissue samples: application to chemical analysis of human hair melanins Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2011; 24 :605-613 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), or to hydroiodic acid (HI) hydrolysis to yield the pheomelanin marker, 4-amino-3-hydroxyphenylalanine (4-AHP) ( Wakamatsu et al., 2002 78. Wakamatsu, K. ∙ Ito, S. ∙ Rees, J.L. The usefulness of 4-amino-3-hydroxyphenylalanine as a specific marker of pheomelanin Pigment Cell Res. 2002; 15 :225-232 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ), then the samples were analyzed by HPLC. Amounts of each marker are reported as ng of marker per 10 6 cells or mg fur. Pheomelanin and eumelanin contents were calculated by multiplying the 4-AHP and PTCA contents by factors of 7 and 25, respectively ( d’Ischia et al., 2013 16. d’Ischia, M. ∙ Wakamatsu, K. ∙ Napolitano, A. ... Melanins and melanogenesis: methods, standards, protocols Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2013; 26 :616-633 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Skin reflectance measurements were made using a CR-400 Colorimeter (Minolta Corporation, Japan). Before each measurement, the instrument was calibrated against the white standard background provided by the manufacturer. The degree of melanization (darkness) is defined as the colorimetric measurement on the ∗ L axis (luminance, ranging from completely white to completely black) of the Centre Internationale d’Eclairage (CIE) L ∗ a ∗ b ∗ color system ( Park et al., 1999 52. Park, S.B. ∙ Suh, D.H. ∙ Youn, J.I. A long-term time course of colorimetric evaluation of ultraviolet light-induced skin reactions Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 1999; 24 :315-320 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each data point is the mean of measurements performed in technical triplicate (three different locations within the same ear).
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was measured directly using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Enzo Life Sciences, #ADI-901-066). cAMP was quantified in 100,000 cells based on a standard curve.
Human melanoma cell lines and isolated primary cultured human melanocytes were propagated and tested in early passage (Passages 7 to 9). The effects of NNT inhibitors (2,3BD, DCC, and Palmitoyl coenzyme A lithium salt) on cell viability were evaluated by the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, #G7570) and measurement of luminescence was performed on an EnVision 2104 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). Human melanoma cell lines and primary melanocytes were plated on 96-well white plates (10,000 cells/well) and were treated with the NNT inhibitors at the indicated concentrations for 24 h.
Cell lysates were prepared from equal numbers of cells after 24 h of DCC or 2,3BD treatment, following the manufacturer’s protocols. Seventy-two h post siRNA treatment or overexpression of NNT and their corresponding controls, glutathione levels were determined using the GSH/GSSG-Glo assay (Promega, #V6611) and luminescence was measured using an EnVision 2104 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer).
Cell lysates were prepared from equal numbers of UACC257 human melanoma cells 72 h post siRNA treatment or overexpression of NNT and their corresponding controls. NADPH/NADP + ratios were determined using the NADP/NADPH-Glo Assay (Promega, #G9082) following the manufacturer’s protocol and luminescence was measured using an EnVision 2104 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer).
To measure MITF transcriptional activity, UACC257 melanoma cell lines were infected with the dual-reporter system (GeneCopoeia, #HPRM39435-LvPM02), which expresses secreted Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) under the TRPM1 promoter and SEAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase) as an internal control for signal normalization. The cells were grown in complete RPMI medium containing 10% Fetal Plex. Medium was collected 24, 48, and 72 h post siRNA transfection. GLuc and SEAP activities were measured by Secrete-Pair Gaussia Luciferase Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia, #LF062) and QUANTI-Blue Solution (Invivogen, #rep-qbs), respectively, according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
For histology, paraffin sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using the ihisto service ( https://www.ihisto.io/ ). For visualization of melanin, paraffin sections were stained using a Fontana-Masson Stain kit (abcam, #ab150669). Briefly, the samples were incubated in warmed Ammoniacal silver solution for 30 min, followed by a Nuclear Fast Red stain.
For immunofluorescence, paraffin sections were deparaffinized by xylene and rehydrated gradually with ethanol to distilled water. Sections were submerged in 0.01 M citrate buffer and boiled for 10 min for retrieval of antigen. The sections were washed with TBST (0.1% Tween 20) and blocked with protein blocking solution (Agilent, #X090930-2) for 1 h at room temperature before application of primary antibody [1:100 diluted in Antibody Diluent (DAKO, #S3022)] and incubation overnight at 4°C. The following day, sections were washed with TBST three times and incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG (G+L) (ThermoFisher Scientific, #A-21236), Alexa Fluor 594 F(ab)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (G+L) (ThermoFisher Scientific, #A-11072), or Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, #A-21428). After washing, the tissue sections were coverslipped with mounting medium (SlowFade® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI, ThermoFisher Scientific, #S36939). MaxBlock Autofluorescence Reducing Reagent Kit (MaxVision Biosciences, #MB-L) was used to quench skin tissue autofluorescence according to the reagent instructions.
The following primary antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions (antibody sources are in the Key Resources Table): anti-CPDs monoclonal antibody (1:1,500), rabbit anti-γ-H2AX (P-ser139) polyclonal antibody (1:5,000), rabbit anti-NNT (C-terminal) polyclonal antibody (1:100), rabbit anti-γ-H2AX [p Ser139] polyclonal antibody (1:100).
Primary human melanocytes (50,000 cells/well) were cultured on chamber slides (ThermoFisher Scientific, #125657). Seventy-two hours post siRNA transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (ThermoFisher Scientific, #50980487) for 20 min at room temperature, followed by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min and blocking with 10% goat serum (Sigma Aldrich, #G9023) containing 5% BSA in PBS for 60 min atroom temperature. Mouse anti-NNT monoclonal antibody [8B4BB10] was diluted with the blocking solution to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml and incubated with the cells overnight at 4°C. The following day, the slides were washed with TBST three times and incubated with donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (1:500). Sections were washed with TBST three times and mounted in mounting medium (VECTASHIELD® HardSet Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI, Vector Laboratories, #H-1500). Images were captured using confocal microscopy (Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Inverted Phase Contrast Fluorescence microscope).
The redox-sensitive fluorescent dye chloromethyl-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetates (CM-H2DCFDA, ThermoFisher Scientific, #C6827) was used to measure intracellular ROS accumulation. UACC257 melanoma cells were cultured on a glass bottom dish and treated with the indicated siRNAs. Forty-eight h post siRNA treatment, 2 μM CM-H2DCFDA in PBS/5% FBS was added and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min to assess overall ROS production. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 5 μM MitoSOX Red (ThermoFisher Scientific, #M36008) in PBS/5% FBS at 37°C for 10 min, washed with HBSS, and analyzed by immunofluorescence imaging (Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Inverted Phase Contrast Fluorescence microscope). The results were normalized to cell numbers, which were determined by nuclear staining with 1 drop per ml of NucBlue (ThermoFisher Scientific, #R37605) at 37°C for 15 min.
Cultured primary human melanocytes were grown in Medium 254 in 6-well transwell plates. Ninety-six h post siRNA or overexpression treatment, the cells were fixed with a modified Karnovsky’s fixative (2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) for at least 2 h on a gentle rotator, followed by rinsing several times with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Then, the cells were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide/0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h, rinsed thoroughly in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, scraped, and the cell suspensions were transferred into 15 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged (3,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4°C). Pelleted material was embedded in 2% agarose, dehydrated through an ethanol gradient (series of solutions from 30% to 100% ethanol), dehydrated briefly in 100% propylene oxide, then allowed to infiltrate overnight on a gentle rotator in a 1:1 mix of propylene oxide and Eponate resin (Ted Pella, Inc., kit with DMP30, #18010’). The following day, specimens were transferred into fresh 100% Eponate resin for 2-3 hours, then embedded in flat molds in 100% fresh Eponate resin, and embeddings were allowed to polymerize for 24-48 h at 60°C. Thin (70 nm) sections were cut using a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome, collected onto formvar-coated grids, stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate, and examined in a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Images were collected using an AMT digital imaging system with proprietary image capture software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA).
Measurements of distances between melanosomes and mitochondria were quantified in FIJI (ImageJ) ( Schindelin et al., 2012 68. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ) by applying a customized macro to TEM micrographs. Melanosomes (N = ∼50) were randomly selected for each condition within the whole image dataset. Thirty Euclidean distances from the melanosome surface to the closest mitochondria surface were measured in nm. From these 30 single measurements the mean was calculated to give a final single mean value per melanosome-mitochondria event. A total of ∼50 events (N) were quantified per condition. Data were plotted and statistically analyzed using Prism 8 (Version 8.4.3). Melanosome-mitochondria distances closer than 20 nm were considered melanosome-mitochondria close appositions or contacts, consistent with ( Daniele et al., 2014 18. Daniele, T. ∙ Hurbain, I. ∙ Vago, R. ... Mitochondria and melanosomes establish physical contacts modulated by Mfn2 and involved in organelle biogenesis Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :393-403 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cell area (μm 2 ), number of melanosome-mitochondria contacts, and number of mitochondria were quantified in FIJI (ImageJ) using polygon and multi-point selection tools.
Melanosome identification and quantification were performed with images at 40,000 x magnification or higher. Stages were estimated based on morphological features previously noted, namely multivesicular endosomes (Stage I), unpigmented fibrils (Stage II), pigmented fibrils (stage III), and darkly pigmented filled melanosomes (Stage IV). All identifiable melanosomes in 4 cells per condition were quantified and classified, and the proportions of each stage were normalized to cell cytosolic area (determined by ImageJ).
UACC257 human melanoma cells were treated with human NNT siRNA or non-targeting siRNA control pool for 4 days. Cell lysates were prepared by adding 1% Trion X100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Tyrosinase activity was measured as previously described ( Iozumi et al., 1993 28. Iozumi, K. ∙ Hoganson, G.E. ∙ Pennella, R. ... Role of tyrosinase as the determinant of pigmentation in cultured human melanocytes J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100 :806-811 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, freshly made 25 mM L-DOPA in PBS was heated and added to the cell lysates in a 96-well plate. L-DOPA levels were determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm with shaking for 30 cycles, compared with mushroom tyrosinase (Sigma-Aldrich #T3824, 0 to 50 μg/μl in PBS), using an Envision 2104 Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer).
For all cohorts, the GRCh37/hg19 human genome build was used. SNPs with minor allele frequency less than 1% were excluded from each cohort.
The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center and the review board of the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports have ratified the Rotterdam study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
As detailed in Crawford et al. (2017) 15. Crawford, N.G. ∙ Kelly, D.E. ∙ Hansen, M.E.B. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Loci associated with skin pigmentation identified in African populations Science. 2017; 358 :eaan8433 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar , individuals used in the study were sampled from Ethiopia, Tanzania and Botswana. IRB approval for this project was obtained from the University of Pennsylvania. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and research/ethics approval and permits were obtained from the following institutions prior to sample collection: the University of Addis Ababa and the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Ministry of Science and Technology National Health Research Ethics Review Committee; COSTECH, NIMR and Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; the University of Botswana and the Ministry of Health in Gaborone, Botswana.
The Rotterdam Study (RS) is a prospective population-based follow-up study of the determinants and prognosis of chronic diseases in middle age and elderly participants (aged 45 years and older) living in the Ommoord district (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) ( Ikram et al., 2017 27. Ikram, M.A. ∙ Brusselle, G.G.O. ∙ Murad, S.D. ... The Rotterdam Study: 2018 update on objectives, design and main results Eur. J. Epidemiol. 2017; 32 :807-850 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RS consists of 4,694 people of predominantly North European ancestry.
As part of the dermatological investigation within the RS, participants from three cohorts (RSI, RSII and RSIII) were screened to assess their skin color. In brief, trained physicians scored the skin color of the participants using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 for albino, 2 for white, 3 for white to olive color, 4 for light brown, 5 for brown, and 6 for dark brown to black. The reliability of the assessment has been validated before ( Jacobs et al., 2015 33. Jacobs, L.C. ∙ Hamer, M.A. ∙ Verkouteren, J.A. ... Perceived skin colour seems a swift, valid and reliable measurement Br. J. Dermatol. 2015; 173 :1084-1086 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individuals with dark skin were excluded since they were likely to have a different genetic background than Europeans.
The RS-I and RS-II cohorts were genotyped with the Infinium II HumanHap550K Genotyping BeadChip version 3 (Illumina, San Diego, California USA) and the RS-III cohort was genotyped using the Illumina Human 610 Quad BeadChip. The RS-I, RS-II and RS-III cohorts were imputed separately using 1000 Genomes phase 3 ( Abecasis et al., 2012 1. Abecasis, G.R. ∙ Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes Nature. 2012; 491 :56-65 Crossref Scopus (6008) PubMed Google Scholar ) as the reference dataset. Quality control on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been described before ( Hofman et al., 2015 23. Hofman, A. ∙ Brusselle, G.G. ∙ Darwish Murad, S. ... The Rotterdam Study: 2016 objectives and design update Eur. J. Epidemiol. 2015; 30 :661-708 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). SNPs were filtered out if they had a minor allele frequency of less than 1% or an imputation quality (R2) of less than 0.3. We used MACH software for the imputation with parameter defaults. Best-guess genotypes were called using the GCTA program ( Yang et al., 2011 83. Yang, J. ∙ Lee, S.H. ∙ Goddard, M.E. ... GCTA: a tool for genome-wide complex trait analysis Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011; 88 :76-82 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4825) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameter defaults.
We used a multivariate linear regression model to test for associations between SNPs within the NNT region and skin color in the RS using an additive model ( Purcell et al., 2007 58. Purcell, S. ∙ Neale, B. ∙ Todd-Brown, K. ... PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81 :559-575 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23059) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was adjusted for age, sex and four principal components (variables derived from principal component analysis that were added to correct for possible population stratification and hidden relatedness between participants). The PLINK program was used for conducting associations.
A GWAS study of skin color in the CANDELA cohort has been published ( Adhikari et al., 2019 3. Adhikari, K. ∙ Mendoza-Revilla, J. ∙ Sohail, A. ... A GWAS in Latin Americans highlights the convergent evolution of lighter skin pigmentation in Eurasia Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :358 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ) and summary statistics are available at https://www.gwascentral.org/study/HGVST3308 . Details of the cohort and analyses are in the published study, so only the cohort population and phenotyping are summarized here.
6,357 Latin American individuals were recruited in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Participants were mostly young, with an average age of 24.
A quantitative measure of constitutive skin pigmentation (the Melanin Index, MI) was obtained using a DermaSpectrometer DSMEII reflectometer (Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark). The MI was recorded from both inner arms and the mean of the two readings was used in the analyses.
P values for SNPs in the NNT region were obtained from the published CANDELA summary statistics.
The summary statistics were obtained from a previous study of pigmentation evolution in Africans ( Crawford et al., 2017 15. Crawford, N.G. ∙ Kelly, D.E. ∙ Hansen, M.E.B. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Loci associated with skin pigmentation identified in African populations Science. 2017; 358 :eaan8433 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). Details of the cohort and analyses are in the published study, so only the cohort population and phenotyping are summarized here.
A total of 1,570 ethnically and genetically diverse Africans living in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Botswana were sampled in this cohort.
A DSM II ColorMeter was used to quantify reflectance from the inner underarm. Reflectance values were converted to a standard melanin index score.
P values for SNPs in the NNT region were obtained from the published summary statistics.
There have been many published studies on pigmentation phenotypes in the UK Biobank ( Jiang et al., 2019 36. Jiang, L. ∙ Zheng, Z. ∙ Qi, T. ... A resource-efficient tool for mixed model association analysis of large-scale data Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1749-1755 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the summary statistics are publicly available at https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#DataResource . Details of the cohort and analyses are in the published study, so only the cohort population and phenotyping are summarized here.
The UK Biobank includes more than 500,000 individuals from across the UK, with predominantly White British ancestry.
Self-reported categorical questions were used to record data on skin color and ease of skin tanning.
For skin color, 6 categories were used: very fair, fair, light olive, dark olive, brown, and black ( https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=1717 ). 450,264 responses were available.
For ease of skin tanning ( https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=1727 ), participants were asked “What would happen to your skin if it was repeatedly exposed to bright sunlight without any protection”? Four categories were used: very, moderately, mildly, and never tanned. 446,744 responses were available.
For sun protection use ( https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=2267 ), participants were asked “Do you wear sun protection (e.g., sunscreen lotion, hat) when you spend time outdoors in the summer”? Four categories were used: never/rarely, sometimes, most of the time, and always. 452,925 responses were available.
P values for SNPs in the NNT region were obtained from the published UK Biobank summary statistics.
Considering the huge variation in sample size among the 4 cohorts, Fisher’s method ( Won et al., 2009 81. Won, S. ∙ Morris, N. ∙ Lu, Q. ... Choosing an optimal method to combine P-values Stat. Med. 2009; 28 :1537-1553 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ) of combining p values from independent studies was used, in which p values for one marker across different cohorts were combined to provide an aggregate p value for the meta-analysis of that marker.
Since we tested 332 independent associations, we corrected the significance threshold for multiple testing. We used the false discovery rate (FDR) method of controlling the multiple testing error rate, following the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure ( Benjamini and Cohen, 2017 9. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Cohen, R. Weighted false discovery rate controlling procedures for clinical trials Biostatistics. 2017; 18 :91-104 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Applying the FDR procedure on the set of p values to achieve an overall false positive level of 5%, the adjusted significance threshold was p = 1.01E-3. As there is substantial LD (linkage disequilibrium) between the SNPs, a Bonferroni correction would have been overly conservative.
MC1R is a major determinant of pigmentation, with known genetic variants associated with lighter skin color, red hair, and freckles in European populations ( Quillen et al., 2019 59. Quillen, E.E. ∙ Norton, H.L. ∙ Parra, E.J. ... Shades of complexity: New perspectives on the evolution and genetic architecture of human skin Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 2019; 168 :4-26 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the two European cohorts used in this study, individual-level data were only available for the Rotterdam Study, so the conditional GWAS analysis was conducted only in this cohort.
We retrieved the dose allele of major MC1R variants data from the Rotterdam studies and used them as covariates in the earlier used multiple linear regression model, in addition to the previously mentioned covariates. The association P value of the NNT variant is thus conditioned on the known pigmentation variants in this analysis. These conditioned P values were then compared to the original (unconditioned) P values with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess whether they have been significantly altered due to the conditioning on the known pigmentation variants.
Jacobs et al., 2015 examined three functional variants in MC1R for their relationship with pigmentation in the Rotterdam Study: rs1805007, rs1805008, rs1805009 ( Jacobs et al., 2015 33. Jacobs, L.C. ∙ Hamer, M.A. ∙ Verkouteren, J.A. ... Perceived skin colour seems a swift, valid and reliable measurement Br. J. Dermatol. 2015; 173 :1084-1086 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the first conditional analysis was performed using these three MC1R variants.
Subsequently, an additional set of well-established genetic variants in other pigmentation genes ( Adhikari et al., 2019 3. Adhikari, K. ∙ Mendoza-Revilla, J. ∙ Sohail, A. ... A GWAS in Latin Americans highlights the convergent evolution of lighter skin pigmentation in Eurasia Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :358 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ) were also used for conditioning: rs28777 ( SLC45A2 ), rs12203592 ( IRF4 ), rs1042602 ( TYR ), rs1800404 ( OCA2 ), rs12913832 ( HERC2 ), rs1426654 ( SLC24A5 ), and rs885479 ( MC1R ).
eQTL expression data corresponding to expression levels of the NNT transcript were downloaded from the GTEx database. For each genetic variant in the NNT region, we obtained the normalized effect size (NES) and P value for the alternative (non-reference) allele in each of the two skin tissues: “Skin - Not Sun Exposed (Suprapubic)” and “Skin - Sun Exposed (Lower leg).”
Correlation values were calculated between the regression coefficients for the alternative alleles of each variant from the UK Biobank for each of the three traits and the NES values corresponding to the same alleles (to ensure consistency of effect direction) in each of the two skin tissues.
ImageJ v1.8.0 ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ) was used to quantify the immunoblots. FIJI software enabling pixel-based color quantification was used for Zebrafish analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. In general. for comparisons of two groups, significance was determined by two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests, correcting for multiple t tests with the same two groups using the Holm-Šídák method. One-way and two-way ANOVA tests were used for comparisons of more than two groups involving effects of one or two factors, respectively, using the recommended post-tests for selected pairwise comparisons. The specific statistical tests used for experiments are described in the figure legends. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Levels of significance are indicated by ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001; ns, not significant.
