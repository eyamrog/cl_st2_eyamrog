Title: GPCR-mediated β-arrestin activation deconvoluted with single-molecule precision


Abstract: Summary

β-arrestins bind G protein-coupled receptors to terminate G protein signaling and to facilitate other downstream signaling pathways. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we show that β-arrestin is strongly autoinhibited in its basal state. Its engagement with a phosphopeptide mimicking phosphorylated receptor tail efficiently releases the β-arrestin tail from its N domain to assume distinct conformations. Unexpectedly, we find that β-arrestin binding to phosphorylated receptor, with a phosphorylation barcode identical to the isolated phosphopeptide, is highly inefficient and that agonist-promoted receptor activation is required for β-arrestin activation, consistent with the release of a sequestered receptor C tail. These findings, together with focused cellular investigations, reveal that agonism and receptor C-tail release are specific determinants of the rate and efficiency of β-arrestin activation by phosphorylated receptor. We infer that receptor phosphorylation patterns, in combination with receptor agonism, synergistically establish the strength and specificity with which diverse, downstream β-arrestin-mediated events are directed.

Section: Introduction

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of cell surface receptors, regulate a multitude of physiological processes and are the most common targets for marketed drugs ( Sriram and Insel, 2018 91. Sriram, K. ∙ Insel, P.A. G protein-coupled receptors as targets for approved drugs: how many targets and how many drugs? Mol. Pharmacol. 2018; 93 :251-258 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nonvisual arrestins, β-arrestin (βarr) 1 and 2 (also known as arrestin 2 and 3, respectively) ( Attramadal et al., 1992 4. Attramadal, H. ∙ Arriza, J.L. ∙ Aoki, C. ...

Lohse, M.J. ∙ Benovic, J.L. ∙ Codina, J. ... β-arrestin: a protein that regulates beta-adrenergic receptor function Science. 1990; 248 :1547-1550 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), are recruited by hundreds of different GPCRs ( Gurevich and Gurevich, 2019 27. Gurevich, V.V. ∙ Gurevich, E.V. GPCR signaling regulation: the role of grks and arrestins Front. Pharmacol. 2019; 10 :125 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ) to desensitize G protein signaling and to promote clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis ( Figure 1 A) ( Hilger et al., 2018 35. Hilger, D. ∙ Masureel, M. ∙ Kobilka, B.K. Structure and dynamics of GPCR signaling complexes Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :4-12 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). By scaffolding kinases and other molecules, receptor-activated β-arrestins can also directly facilitate diverse cellular signaling pathways distinct from those initiated by G proteins ( Jean-Charles et al., 2017 40. Jean-Charles, P.-Y. ∙ Kaur, S. ∙ Shenoy, S.K. G protein-coupled receptor signaling through β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2017; 70 :142-158 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smith et al., 2018 90. Smith, J.S. ∙ Lefkowitz, R.J. ∙ Rajagopal, S. Biased signalling: from simple switches to allosteric microprocessors Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2018; 17 :243-260 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is great interest in identifying therapeutics that preferentially promote or block βarr signaling to allow for more efficacious and specific targeting with the potential of reduced side effects. Structural and kinetic insights into the mechanism by which ligand-mediated GPCR activation enables βarr coupling and activation are required to achieve this goal.
Previous investigations have established that receptors interact with βarr at two distinct interfaces. The GPCR kinase (GRK)-phosphorylated receptor carboxy (C)-terminal tail (Rp tail), or phosphorylated intracellular loops in some receptors, binds a positively charged groove within the βarr amino (N)-terminal domain (N domain). For the Rp tail to engage the groove, β-arrestin’s C-terminal tail (βarr tail) must be displaced from this N-domain groove ( Figure 1 A). The receptor transmembrane (TM) helices and cytoplasmic loops (receptor core) can also interact with the central crest loops of βarr, including the finger loop ( Kahsai et al., 2018 44. Kahsai, A.W. ∙ Pani, B. ∙ Lefkowitz, R.J. GPCR signaling: conformational activation of arrestins Cell Res. 2018; 28 :783-784 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scheerer and Sommer, 2017 84. Scheerer, P. ∙ Sommer, M.E. Structural mechanism of arrestin activation Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2017; 45 :160-169 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shukla et al., 2014 89. Shukla, A.K. ∙ Westfield, G.H. ∙ Xiao, K. ... Visualization of arrestin recruitment by a G-protein-coupled receptor Nature. 2014; 512 :218-222 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Structural studies have shown that the receptor can engage βarr solely through its Rp tail (“tail-only” engagement) or through more extensive contacts involving both the receptor core and the Rp tail (“tight” engagement) ( Figure 1 A) ( Shukla et al., 2014 89. Shukla, A.K. ∙ Westfield, G.H. ∙ Xiao, K. ... Visualization of arrestin recruitment by a G-protein-coupled receptor Nature. 2014; 512 :218-222 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). These modes are thought to confer distinct biological functions ( Cahill et al., 2017 8. Cahill, T.J. ∙ Thomsen, A.R.B. ∙ Tarrasch, J.T. ... Distinct conformations of GPCR-β-arrestin complexes mediate desensitization, signaling, and endocytosis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :2562-2567 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Crystal and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of active βarr have revealed rearrangements in the central crest loops and rotation of the C-terminal domain (C domain) relative to the N domain ( Kang et al., 2015 46. Kang, Y. ∙ Zhou, X.E. ∙ Gao, X. ...

However, the conformational changes and dynamics of the βarr tail associated with its release from the N-domain groove, and how receptor engagement affects these events, have yet to be delineated.
In basal (inactive)-state βarr structures, only a short segment of the βarr tail anchored to the N domain is resolved ( Han et al., 2001 29. Han, M. ∙ Gurevich, V.V. ∙ Vishnivetskiy, S.A. ... Crystal structure of β-arrestin at 1.9 Å Structure. 2001; 9 :869-880 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Milano et al., 2002 64. Milano, S.K. ∙ Pace, H.C. ∙ Kim, Y.-M. ... Scaffolding functions of arrestin-2 revealed by crystal structure and mutagenesis Biochemistry. 2002; 41 :3321-3328 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). The position and conformation of the βarr tail in the active state are not known, as the entire βarr tail is either removed or unresolved in these structures ( Gurevich et al., 2018 28. Gurevich, V.V. ∙ Gurevich, E.V. ∙ Uversky, V.N. Arrestins: structural disorder creates rich functionality Protein Cell. 2018; 9 :986-1003 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). The βarr tail contains regions that bind clathrin and adaptin, and it may also be directly involved in, or expose N-domain regions important for, scaffolding signaling kinases, including a direct interaction with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 ( Gurevich and Gurevich, 2015 26. Gurevich, V.V. ∙ Gurevich, E.V. Arrestins: critical players in trafficking of many gpcrs Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2015; 132 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Perry-Hauser et al., 2022 76. Perry-Hauser, N.A. ∙ Hopkins, J.B. ∙ Zhuo, Y. ... The two non-visual arrestins engage ERK2 differently J. Mol. Biol. 2022; 434 :167465 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the timing and nature of βarr tail release, as it relates to receptor engagement and other structural rearrangements in βarr, are critical for understanding βarr-mediated signaling. In addition, a deeper understanding of βarr activation and how it may vary for different receptors and different ligands is necessary to provide insight into the mechanisms underlying biased agonism ( Xiao and Sun, 2018 101. Xiao, K. ∙ Sun, J. Elucidating structural and molecular mechanisms of β-arrestin-biased agonism at GPCRs via MS-based proteomics Cell. Signal. 2018; 41 :56-64 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we use total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-based single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging ( Juette et al., 2014 42. Juette, M.F. ∙ Terry, D.S. ∙ Wasserman, M.R. ... The bright future of single-molecule fluorescence imaging Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2014; 20 :103-111 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ) to investigate the β-arrestin1 (βarr1) activation mechanism by examining release of its C-terminal tail region (βarr1 tail) upon binding of phosphorylated receptor or known mimics of the Rp tail. These measurements enabled direct observation of stochastic, dynamic processes in the βarr1 tail—largely inaccessible to ensemble methods—associated with βarr1’s interaction with receptor and of how these processes are regulated by GPCR activation.
We leveraged our insights from smFRET imaging for targeted, hypothesis-driven studies in living cells to show that agonist-stimulated, full-length, wild-type β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) is unable to recruit β-arrestin2 (βarr2) in the absence of GRK expression, whereas truncation of the receptor’s distal C tail reveals measurable GRK-independent βarr2 recruitment. These findings provide evidence for receptor autoinhibition mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of agonist-induced βarr engagement, downstream signaling, and receptor internalization.

Section: Results

We first sought to investigate the structure and dynamics of the βarr1 tail in the inactive conformation of βarr1 using extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (see STAR Methods ) ( Table S1 ), where the βarr1 tail is defined as the segment from K357 to the C-terminal residue R418 ( Figure 1 B). This analysis revealed a stable interaction of the βarr1 tail segment consisting of residues D384–L396, which we define as the middle segment, with the N-domain groove ( Figures 1 B and 1C). We refer to the βarr1 tail segments before and after the middle segment as the proximal and distal βarr1 tail, respectively. These simulations suggested logical donor and acceptor fluorophore attachment points for smFRET imaging of βarr1 tail dynamics: K397, at the juncture of the middle and distal βarr1 tail segments; and E176, a relatively static and centrally located position in the inter-domain hinge region ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Cysteine substitutions were introduced at these positions into fully functional cysteine-less βarr1 ( Hanson et al., 2007 30. Hanson, S.M. ∙ Cleghorn, W.M. ∙ Francis, D.J. ... Arrestin mobilizes signaling proteins to the cytoskeleton and redirects their activity J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368 :375-387 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the protein was labeled with LD555p and LD655 (the donor and acceptor fluorophores, respectively) to yield what we refer to as the βarr1 tail sensor (see STAR Methods ) ( Figures 1 D and S1 A).
For TIRF imaging, the βarr1 tail sensor was tethered to the surface of a polyethylene glycol passivated and biotinylated quartz slide, using a NeutrAvidin bridge to biotinylated anti-mouse antibody, a mouse StrepMAB-Immo antibody and N-terminal Strep-tagged βarr1 tail sensors (see STAR Methods ) ( Figures 1 D and S1 B). In the basal state, individual smFRET trajectories of βarr1 tail sensor displayed a highly stable FRET efficiency centered at ∼0.72 (referred to as the high-FRET, inactive state) ( Figures 1 E and S1 C). Analogous results were also observed using confocal microscopy of individual, freely diffusing βarr1 tail sensor molecules (see STAR Methods ) ( Figure S1 D). Stable high-efficiency FRET is consistent with an inactive, autoinhibited βarr1 conformation in which the βarr1 tail middle segment (near position 397) remains tightly anchored within the N-domain groove, as observed throughout our MD simulations of the basal state (∼50 μs) ( Figure 1 B). Implicit solvent simulations of fluorophore dynamics ( Noel et al., 2016 70. Noel, J.K. ∙ Levi, M. ∙ Raghunathan, M. ... SMOG 2: a versatile software package for generating structure-based models PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12 :e1004794 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ) starting from a representative MD frame estimated a distance of ∼53 Å between the dyes at positions 176 and 397, consistent with ∼53 Å inter-dye distance estimated from smFRET (see STAR Methods for calculations and assumptions). Notably, rare excursions out of the basal state to a ∼0.89 FRET efficiency state ( Figure 1 E) were observed. This finding is consistent with MD simulations in which the distal βarr1 tail occasionally docked within the “extended groove” between the finger loop and the 160 loop of the N domain, bringing the mean dye positions closer together ( Figure 1 C).
Having validated the βarr1 tail sensor as a reliable reporter of the inactive conformation, we next examined the effects of activation in the presence of a synthetic phosphorylated peptide mimetic of the GRK2-phosphorylated C tail of the human V 2 vasopressin receptor (V 2 Rpp; Table 1 ). V 2 Rpp binds to, and functionally activates, βarr1 ( Shukla et al., 2013 88. Shukla, A.K. ∙ Manglik, A. ∙ Kruse, A.C. ... Structure of active β-arrestin-1 bound to a G-protein-coupled receptor phosphopeptide Nature. 2013; 497 :137-141 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiao et al., 2004 100. Xiao, K. ∙ Shenoy, S.K. ∙ Nobles, K. ... Activation-dependent conformational changes in β-arrestin 2 J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :55744-55753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thus serves as a model for the tail-only receptor engagement mode. When V 2 Rpp was injected into the microfluidic imaging chamber in which βarr1 tail sensor molecules were surface tethered, we observed reversible transitions to a distinct state, with a mean FRET efficiency value of ∼0.46 (mid-FRET, active state) ( Figures 2 A–2C). Occupancy of the mid-FRET, active state increased with higher V 2 Rpp concentrations, whereas that of the high-FRET, inactive states was depleted ( Figure 2 D). The EC 50 of this binding process was 2.6 ± 0.36 μM, in accordance with the binding affinity of V 2 Rpp for unlabeled wild-type βarr1 measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (see STAR Methods ) (2.4 ± 0.2 μM; Figure 2 E), indicating negligible effects of the cysteine substitutions, fluorophore attachment, or surface tethering of βarr1. Similar results were obtained from confocal smFRET measurements of the same binding reaction ( Figure S1 D). Measurement of smFRET dynamics by TIRF of a different βarr1 tail sensor variant labeled at positions 110 (at the end of the N-domain helix; Figure 1 B) and 397, in the presence of increasing V 2 Rpp concentrations, yielded similar outcomes from a distinct structural perspective ( Figure S2 ).
In line with the ability of V 2 Rpp to act as a phosphorylated receptor surrogate for activation of βarr1, the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide (V 2 Rnp; Table 1 ) had no effect on the FRET efficiency distribution, even at millimolar concentrations ( Figure 2 D). Thus, as expected, V 2 Rpp binding leads, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, to release of the βarr1 tail middle segment from the N domain. In addition, the observed changes in FRET efficiency suggest a movement of the middle and distal segments of the tail away from both positions 176 and 110.
To investigate the kinetics of V 2 Rpp binding and dissociation from βarr1, we calculated the transition rates between the high-FRET, inactive and mid-FRET, active states using hidden Markov modeling (HMM) and likelihood maximization (see STAR Methods ) ( Juette et al., 2016 41. Juette, M.F. ∙ Terry, D.S. ∙ Wasserman, M.R. ... Single-molecule imaging of non-equilibrium molecular ensembles on the millisecond timescale Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :341-344 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Increasing V 2 Rpp concentrations reduced the duration of high-FRET, inactive-state dwell times, while having no effect on mid-FRET, active-state dwell times ( Figure 2 F), consistent with concentration-dependent V 2 Rpp binding and concentration-independent unbinding processes, respectively. The apparent rate constant for V 2 Rpp binding was ∼0.10 μM −1 s −1 ( Figure 2 G), more than three orders of magnitude slower than expected for a diffusion-controlled bimolecular interaction between structured macromolecules (on the order of 100–1,000 μM −1 s −1 ) ( Schreiber et al., 2009 85. Schreiber, G. ∙ Haran, G. ∙ Zhou, H.X. Fundamental aspects of protein-protein association kinetics Chem. Rev. 2009; 109 :839-860 Crossref Scopus (522) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stopped-flow V 2 Rpp addition and washout studies revealed apparent binding and unbinding rates similar to those evidenced by HMM analysis of the equilibrium data (k on : ∼0.27 μM −1 s −1 ; k off : ∼0.21 s −1 ) ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Thus, V 2 Rpp-induced βarr1 tail release, although appreciably faster than would be expected by autoinhibited apo βarr1, is rate limited by one or more unresolved conformational events. We speculate that an initial interaction of V 2 Rpp with the βarr1 “extended groove” could facilitate βarr1 tail release through active mechanisms. However, we cannot rule out a mechanism involving spontaneous tail release that is either too rapid or small in scale to be detected by our smFRET analysis.
An antibody fragment (Fab30) against βarr1, developed for structural determination purposes, is known to stabilize a βarr1 conformation that preferentially binds activated GPCRs ( Shukla et al., 2013 88. Shukla, A.K. ∙ Manglik, A. ∙ Kruse, A.C. ... Structure of active β-arrestin-1 bound to a G-protein-coupled receptor phosphopeptide Nature. 2013; 497 :137-141 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fab30 induced a >200-fold increase in apparent V 2 Rpp binding affinity (12 nM versus 2.6 μM; Figure 2 D). Kinetic dissociation experiments confirmed that the βarr1 tail sensor remained bound to V 2 Rpp in the presence of Fab30 for T 1/2 ≈ 33 min ( Figures S3 A–S3D), suggesting that the increase in affinity imparted by Fab30 is due to a dramatic decrease of the V 2 Rpp dissociation rate.
Prior studies have suggested that heparin ( Figure 3 A), a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan that has been used to activate arrestins ( Xiao et al., 2004 100. Xiao, K. ∙ Shenoy, S.K. ∙ Nobles, K. ... Activation-dependent conformational changes in β-arrestin 2 J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :55744-55753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhuang et al., 2010 103. Zhuang, T. ∙ Vishnivetskiy, S.A. ∙ Gurevich, V.V. ... Elucidation of inositol hexaphosphate and heparin interaction sites and conformational changes in arrestin-1 by solution nuclear magnetic resonance Biochemistry. 2010; 49 :10473-10485 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), may stabilize βarr1 tail conformations distinct from those stabilized by V 2 Rpp ( Xiao et al., 2004 100. Xiao, K. ∙ Shenoy, S.K. ∙ Nobles, K. ... Activation-dependent conformational changes in β-arrestin 2 J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :55744-55753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). In striking contrast to V 2 Rpp, heparin induced βarr1 tail dynamics between high-FRET, inactive and mid-FRET, active states that were roughly two orders of magnitude more rapid ( Figure 3 B), as well as transitions between mid-FRET and a distinct low-FRET, active state with a mean FRET value of ∼0.16 ( Figure 3 C). Moreover, heparin exhibited an approximately 17 nM affinity for βarr1, roughly 150-fold higher than V 2 Rpp ( Figures 3 D and 3E). Given the observation that a similar low-FRET, active state was also observed, albeit rarely, with V 2 Rpp ( Figure 2 C), we speculate that heparin facilitates a βarr1 switch to an alternative active state that exhibits distinct C-tail positioning and dynamics. Consistent with this model, switching events between both activated modes were directly evidenced by smFRET, albeit rarely ( Figure 3 F). These data suggest that the βarr1 tail can adopt at least two distinct active-state conformations, where the “released” βarr1 tail may exhibit alternative residual structured elements or docking sites.
βarrs also bind phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) ( Gaidarov et al., 1999 22. Gaidarov, I. ∙ Krupnick, J.G. ∙ Falck, J.R. ... Arrestin function in G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis requires phosphoinositide binding EMBO J. 1999; 18 :871-881 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the soluble inositol hexaphosphate (IP 6 ) ( Chen et al., 2017 10.

PIP 2 has been implicated in membrane trafficking ( De Matteis and Godi, 2004 14. De Matteis, M.A. ∙ Godi, A. PI-loting membrane traffic Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6 :487-492 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roth, 2004 82. Roth, M.G. Phosphoinositides in constitutive membrane traffic Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84 :699-730 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ) and recruitment of various components of clathrin-coated structures ( Kadlecova et al., 2017 43. Kadlecova, Z. ∙ Spielman, S.J. ∙ Loerke, D. ... Regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by hierarchical allosteric activation of AP2 J.

Clathrin domains involved in recognition by assembly protein AP-2 J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 :7950-7956 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, IP 6 regulates several intracellular processes including agonist-induced receptor desensitization ( Sasakawa et al., 1994 83. Sasakawa, N. ∙ Ferguson, J.E. ∙ Sharif, M. ... Attenuation of agonist-induced desensitization of the rat substance P receptor by microinjection of inositol pentakis-and hexakisphosphates in Xenopus laevis oocytes Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46 :380-385 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to heparin and V 2 Rpp, IP 6 and the soluble PIP 2 derivative, diC8-PI(4,5)P 2 , failed to induce any detectible transitions out of the high-FRET, inactive state in the βarr1 tail sensor ( Figures 3 G and 3H). The binding affinity of βarr1 for V 2 Rpp was also unaffected by either IP 6 or PIP 2 over the range of physiological concentrations tested ( Figure 3 I). These findings are consistent with the effects of IP 6 being specific to βarr2, and not βarr1, activation ( Chen et al., 2017 10. Chen, Q. ∙ Perry, N.A. ∙ Vishnivetskiy, S.A. ...

An eight amino acid segment controls oligomerization and preferred conformation of the two non-visual arrestins J. Mol. Biol. 2021; 433 :166790 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PIP 2 requiring proximal membranes rather than being mediated solely by direct association with βarr1.
We next sought to investigate the molecular determinants that enforce βarr1 autoinhibition and to explore possible roles of allostery in βarr1 activation. Mutations in distinct structural domains of βarr have been described as constitutively activating due to their propensity to induce receptor desensitization and internalization, even in the absence of agonist-induced receptor activation ( Eichel et al., 2018 19. Eichel, K. ∙ Jullié, D. ∙ Barsi-Rhyne, B. ... Catalytic activation of β-arrestin by GPCRs Nature. 2018; 557 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ; Latorraca et al., 2018 54. Latorraca, N.R. ∙ Wang, J.K. ∙ Bauer, B. ... Molecular mechanism of GPCR-mediated arrestin activation Nature. 2018; 557 :452-456 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Constitutively activating mutations include those that disrupt the three-element interaction (3-EI) region that anchors the βarr tail middle segment to the N-domain groove in the inactive state ( Gurevich, 1998 25. Gurevich, V.V. The selectivity of visual arrestin for light-activated phosphorhodopsin is controlled by multiple nonredundant mechanisms J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :15501-15506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ostermaier et al., 2014 73. Ostermaier, M.K. ∙ Peterhans, C. ∙ Jaussi, R. ...

Scheerer, P. ∙ Sommer, M.E. Structural mechanism of arrestin activation Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2017; 45 :160-169 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A, left).
We hypothesized that such mutations should increase βarr1 tail disengagement in the absence of, and/or increase sensitivity to, V 2 Rpp. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that in the absence of V 2 Rpp, the βarr1 tail sensor bearing the 3-EI mutations, I386A, V387A, and F388A ( Celver et al., 2002 9. Celver, J. ∙ Vishnivetskiy, S.A. ∙ Chavkin, C. ... Conservation of the phosphate-sensitive elements in the arrestin family of proteins J. Biol.

MD simulations of basal βarr1 with the 3-EI mutations showed that disrupted hydrophobic interactions between the βarr1 tail middle segment and the N-domain helix propagated to allosterically perturb R393, which dissociated from the polar core. Consistent with the decreased FRET efficiency in the absence of V 2 Rpp in the 3EI-βarr1 tail sensor, these reconfigurations affected the position of residue 397, lengthening the distance between 176 and 397 ( Figures S4 B and S4C). Weaker βarr1 tail anchoring was also evidenced by an 86-fold increase in apparent V 2 Rpp binding affinity (EC 50 : V 2 Rpp with the 3EI mutant, 30 nM versus V 2 Rpp with the parent construct, 2.6 μM) ( Figure 4 C). In contrast to the parent sensor, the 3EI-βarr1 tail sensor displayed increased occupancy in the low-FRET, active state, which increased as a function of V 2 Rpp concentration ( Figures 4 C and S4 D).
Mutations proximal to the finger loop region of βarr, which is responsible for engaging the receptor core ( Eichel et al., 2018 19. Eichel, K. ∙ Jullié, D. ∙ Barsi-Rhyne, B. ...

Molecular mechanism of GPCR-mediated arrestin activation Nature. 2018; 557 :452-456 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A, right), were also shown to constitutively activate βarr, possibly by disrupting a salt bridge that stabilizes the inactive-state conformation with respect to inter-domain rotation ( Eichel et al., 2018 19. Eichel, K. ∙ Jullié, D. ∙ Barsi-Rhyne, B. ... Catalytic activation of β-arrestin by GPCRs Nature. 2018; 557 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to the 3EI-βarr1 tail sensor, we observed that a finger loop-proximal point mutation (E313K; 313K-βarr1 tail sensor) (see STAR Methods ) did not substantially perturb the anchored βarr1 tail under basal conditions. However, V 2 Rpp bound with a 4-fold higher apparent affinity (EC 50 of ∼0.63 μM for E313K versus 2.6 μM for the parent sensor) ( Figure 4 D), an effect arising predominantly from a faster apparent rate of V 2 Rpp binding ( Figures S4 E and S4F). Similar results were also observed for a distinct proximal finger loop mutant (R76A, K77A, D78A) ( Figure S4 G). These results suggest that mutations in both the finger loop-proximal and 3-EI regions can promote βarr1 tail disengagement from the βarr1 N-domain groove, implicating both regions in a bidirectional allosteric process important for regulating βarr1 activation.
Building on these observations, we set out to examine how GRK-phosphorylated receptor engages and activates βarr1. More specifically, we asked if the activation mechanism is identical in the context of the full receptor and to what extent βarr1 engagement with the core of an activated GPCR may alter this mechanism. To this end, we expressed and purified a β 2 AR chimera with its C terminus replaced by that of the V 2 vasopressin receptor (β 2 V 2 R) (see STAR Methods ). Such receptor-V 2 R C-terminal tail chimeras ( Cahill et al., 2017 8. Cahill, T.J. ∙ Thomsen, A.R.B. ∙ Tarrasch, J.T. ...

Importantly, β 2 V 2 R exhibits a normal β 2 AR pharmacological profile ( Oakley et al., 2000 72. Oakley, R.H. ∙ Laporte, S.A. ∙ Holt, J.A. ...

Notably, this approach also allowed us to deconvolute the roles of phosphorylation and agonist binding, two mechanistic steps that are conflated in cellular systems, where agonist binding promotes receptor phosphorylation.
We first imaged surface-tethered βarr1 tail sensor dynamics in the presence of increasing concentrations of GRK2-phosphorylated β 2 V 2 R (pβ 2 V 2 R) (see STAR Methods ) ( Figure 5 A). Surprisingly, in the presence of 1 μM pβ 2 V 2 R in the unliganded (apo) state or bound to the inverse agonist carazolol (cz), the βarr1 tail sensor stably occupied the high-FRET, inactive state, exhibiting only rare, transient excursions to the mid-FRET, active state ( Figures 5 B and 5C), which were not observed in the absence of receptor ( Figure 1 E). This result was unexpected, as similar concentrations of the free V 2 Rpp peptide were strongly activating ( Figure 2 D). Strikingly, the βarr1 tail sensor remained in a predominantly inactive conformation even in the presence of 5 μM pβ 2 V 2 R ( Figure 5 D). We infer from these observations that the phosphorylated V 2 R tail, when attached to β 2 AR, is relatively inaccessible to βarr1, indicating that context-specific effects sequester the Rp tail. Whereas the receptor context appeared to significantly reduce the frequency and duration of phosphorylated V 2 R tail binding events to βarr1, Fab30 nevertheless promoted receptor engagement and βarr1 tail release ( Figure S3 E), suggesting that rare and transient interactions of the inactive-state receptor tail with βarr1 can be stabilized by Fab30.
In contrast to apo and inverse agonist-bound receptor, in the presence of pβ 2 V 2 R with saturating concentrations of the full agonist epinephrine (epi), βarr1 displayed mid-FRET, active-state dwells that were more than 100 times longer than in the absence of agonist, resulting in substantial mid-FRET, active-state occupancy ( Figures 5 B–5G). The concentration dependence of epi-activated pβ 2 V 2 R binding to βarr1 tail sensor revealed an apparent affinity of ∼1 μM ( Figure 5 D). Thus, agonist binding to pβ 2 V 2 R promotes much stronger Rp tail engagement and βarr1 activation, resulting in apparent affinity comparable to that of free V 2 Rpp.
However, in contrast to V 2 Rpp, the epi-activated pβ 2 V 2 R induced multi-modal dynamics of the βarr1 tail, consisting of both transient (∼0.1 s) and long-lived (∼30–60 s, limited by photobleaching) engagement durations ( Figures 5 F and 5G). We speculate that the transient dwells correspond to configurations in which only the Rp tail is engaged (tail-only). Notably, however, as for the apo and inverse agonist-bound receptor, we found the mean dwell times of tail-only engagement to be shorter than those observed with V 2 Rpp ( Figure 5 H), suggesting a less optimal binding of the phosphorylated V 2 R tail in the context of the receptor, compared with that of the free peptide. In considering the basis for this impaired binding mode, we noted that the first two phosphorylated residues (P1 and P2) of the isolated V 2 Rpp peptide interact with residues near the finger loop region of βarr1 ( Shukla et al., 2013 88. Shukla, A.K. ∙ Manglik, A. ∙ Kruse, A.C. ... Structure of active β-arrestin-1 bound to a G-protein-coupled receptor phosphopeptide Nature. 2013; 497 :137-141 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S5 A) (see STAR Methods ). By contrast, in the cryo-EM structure of βarr1 showing tail-only engagement with the receptor ( Nguyen et al., 2019 67. Nguyen, A.H. ∙ Thomsen, A.R.B. ∙ Cahill, T.J. ... Structure of an endosomal signaling GPCR-G protein-β-arrestin megacomplex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :1123-1131 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), P1 and P2 are unresolved, but the residue before P3, which is resolved in the structure, points away from the extended groove in βarr1, unlike in the isolated V 2 Rpp-bound βarr1 structure ( Figure S5 B). Taken together, these structural comparisons suggest that, in the context of the receptor, P1 and P2 cannot optimally bind to βarr1 due to steric constraints imposed by the linkage of the phosphorylated V 2 R tail to helix 8 (H8) of the receptor. Cryo-EM structures of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 and β 1 -adrenergic receptor complexed with βarr1 ( Lee et al., 2020 56. Lee, Y. ∙ Warne, T. ∙ Nehmé, R. ... Molecular basis of β-arrestin coupling to formoterol-bound β1-adrenoceptor Nature. 2020; 583 :862-866 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Staus et al., 2020 93. Staus, D.P. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of the M2 muscarinic receptor-β-arrestin complex in a lipid nanodisc Nature. 2020; 579 :297-302 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ) also show P1 and P2 to be unresolved, suggesting these regions remain highly dynamic.
By contrast, the longer dwells suggest a substantially more stable complex of βarr1 with pβ 2 V 2 R than with V 2 Rpp. Consistent with a highly stable complex, the mid-FRET, active state persisted for several minutes after free receptor was washed from the imaging chamber ( Figures S6 A and S6B). We speculate that this stability is driven by “tight” receptor engagement inducing global conformational changes in βarr that further weaken its propensity for autoinhibition and contribute stabilizing contacts between βarr1 and receptor ( Lee et al., 2020 56. Lee, Y. ∙ Warne, T. ∙ Nehmé, R. ... Molecular basis of β-arrestin coupling to formoterol-bound β1-adrenoceptor Nature. 2020; 583 :862-866 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, despite incomplete engagement of the P1 and P2 positions in the Rp tail with βarr1, MD simulations of pβ 2 V 2 R revealed extensive and stable interactions of activated βarr1 with the receptor core ( Figure 5 I). We note in this context that since P2 makes an important contribution to V 2 Rpp binding affinity ( Latorraca et al., 2020 53. Latorraca, N.R. ∙ Masureel, M. ∙ Hollingsworth, S.A. ... How GPCR phosphorylation patterns orchestrate arrestin-mediated signaling Cell. 2020; 183 :1813-1825 e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), the stability of the long-lived complex observed in smFRET may also reflect more effective engagement enabled by conformational changes in the activated complex.
We next explored the impact of β 2 AR positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) on βarr1 tail release and βarr1 activation. Compound 6FA (Cmpd-6FA) exhibits positive cooperativity with epi and binds β 2 AR near intracellular loop 2 in a pocket between TMs 3 and 4 to promote βarr coupling ( Ahn et al., 2018 2. Ahn, S. ∙ Pani, B. ∙ Kahsai, A.W. ... Small-molecule positive allosteric modulators of the β2-adrenoceptor isolated from DNA-encoded libraries Mol. Pharmacol. 2018; 94 :850-861 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2019 58. Liu, X. ∙ Masoudi, A. ∙ Kahsai, A.W. ... Mechanism of β2AR regulation by an intracellular positive allosteric modulator Science. 2019; 364 :1283-1287 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with previous cellular investigations, Cmpd-6FA (see STAR Methods ) enhanced the potency of epi to promote long-lived mid-FRET, active-state dwells of βarr1 in the presence of 1 μM pβ 2 V 2 R ( Figures 5 B, 5C, 5E, and 5F). These observations are consistent with a model in which PAMs increase agonist binding affinity for the receptor, promoting long-lived activating interactions with βarr1.
To explore the contribution of receptor tail phosphorylation to βarr1 tail disengagement and βarr1 activation, we examined β 2 V 2 R prepared without agonist treatment and in the absence of GRK2 (see STAR Methods ). Under these conditions, β 2 V 2 R is basally phosphorylated at positions P1, P2, P7, and P8 but not the other four positions (P3–P6) ( Table 1 ) ( Nguyen et al., 2019 67. Nguyen, A.H. ∙ Thomsen, A.R.B. ∙ Cahill, T.J. ... Structure of an endosomal signaling GPCR-G protein-β-arrestin megacomplex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :1123-1131 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the presence of 10 μM Cmpd-6FA and saturating epi, we observed no substantial effect on βarr1 tail release with the basally phosphorylated receptor (bpβ 2 V 2 R) ( Figure S6 C), nor any evidence of stable receptor-βarr1 complex formation by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) of freely diffusing molecules ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Similarly, the corresponding basally phosphorylated peptide (V 2 Rbp; Table 1 ) showed no effect on βarr1 tail release or dynamics at concentrations as high as 1 mM ( Figure 2 D). The finger loop-proximal mutation E313K, which increases the affinity of V 2 Rpp engagement ( Figure 4 D), was unable to rescue βarr1 tail activation by bpβ 2 V 2 R ( Figure S6 F). These findings indicate the following: (1) receptor core engagement is transient in the absence of adequately phosphorylated Rp tail; (2) core engagement alone, if it occurs, is insufficient to induce appreciable βarr1 tail release; and (3) P3 to P6 are critical to the βarr1 activation mechanism.
To investigate whether it is possible to capture the tail-only mode of Rp tail-bound βarr1 without engaging the receptor core, we used nanobody Nb6B9, a G protein mimetic expected to compete with βarr1 for core engagement. In these experiments, epi was insufficient to induce βarr1 tail release, and Fab30 was required to capture βarr1 engaged with the Rp tail in the tail-only configuration ( Figure S3 E). These findings suggest that the tail-only mode is transient in the absence of Fab30 stabilization and that both core and Rp tail engagement are required to induce efficient βarr1 tail release in the context of the full receptor.
The experiments described above were conducted using purified receptor of defined phosphorylation state and purified βarr1, making it possible for us to deconvolute the effects of agonist binding from those of receptor phosphorylation. This cannot be achieved in the context of living cells, since agonist stimulation of receptor is required for efficient GRK phosphorylation. We therefore sought to examine the implications of our findings in a more physiological, cellular context. To do so, we used HEK293 cells in which GRK 2/3/5/6 were simultaneously knocked out (HEK GRK KO) via CRISPR-Cas9 methods ( Kawakami et al., 2022 47. Kawakami, K. ∙ Yanagawa, M. ∙ Hiratsuka, S. ... Heterotrimeric Gq proteins act as a switch for GRK5/6 selectivity underlying β-arrestin transducer bias Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :487 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ) to explore core-mediated βarr recruitment in the absence of GRK-mediated receptor tail phosphorylation. To generalize our findings to a more native scenario, we used wild-type β 2 AR with its native C tail ( Figure S7 A), as well as βarr2, which is more commonly associated with the physiological effects of β 2 AR activation in vivo . For these investigations, we used a bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay that detects recruitment of βarr to the plasma membrane upon activation of receptors ( Donthamsetti et al., 2015 15. Donthamsetti, P. ∙ Quejada, J.R. ∙ Javitch, J.A. ... Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70 :2.14.1-2.14.14 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Perry-Hauser et al., 2021 75. Perry-Hauser, N.A. ∙ Asher, W.B. ∙ Hauge Pedersen, M. ... Assays for detecting arrestin interaction with GPCRs Methods Cell Biol. 2021; 166 :43-65 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see STAR Methods ) ( Figure 6 A). The bystander BRET assay avoids receptor C-tail modifications that might perturb receptor function or interactions. Notably, we were unable to detect βarr2 surface recruitment by isoproterenol (ISO)-activated β 2 AR in the absence of GRK ( Figures 6 B and 6C), whereas robust βarr2 recruitment was rescued by expression of GRK2 ( Figures 6 D and 6E), which mediates Rp tail phosphorylation. These results are consistent with inferences from our smFRET and FCS data that core engagement of βarr is weak in the absence of Rp tail phosphorylation.
Given that the Rp tail of β 2 V 2 R does not efficiently activate βarr1 in the absence of agonist, pointing to receptor C-tail sequestration and resulting inhibition of βarr binding, we wondered whether the wild-type β 2 AR C tail in living cells might also inhibit βarr interaction with receptor even in the presence of agonist. If so, this autoinhibition might be relieved by removal of the receptor C tail. An extensive truncation of the β 2 AR C tail after palmitoylated C341 (β 2 AR-341tr) led to very limited surface expression, but another previously described β 2 AR construct truncated after residue 365 (β 2 AR-365tr) was expressed at levels only slightly lower than wild-type β 2 AR ( Figures S7 A and S7B). This construct preserves residues T360 and S364, which have been shown to be robustly phosphorylated by GRK2 ( Nobles et al., 2011 69. Nobles, K.N. ∙ Xiao, K. ∙ Ahn, S. ... Distinct phosphorylation sites on the β(2)-adrenergic receptor establish a barcode that encodes differential functions of β-arrestin Sci. Signal. 2011; 4 :ra51 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas a prior study suggested that β 2 AR-365tr does not interact with βarr ( Nuber et al., 2016 71. Nuber, S. ∙ Zabel, U. ∙ Lorenz, K. ... β-arrestin biosensors reveal a rapid, receptor-dependent activation/deactivation cycle Nature. 2016; 531 :661-664 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), a more recent study showed that β 2 AR-365tr can still mediate βarr activation ( Eichel et al., 2018 19. Eichel, K. ∙ Jullié, D. ∙ Barsi-Rhyne, B. ... Catalytic activation of β-arrestin by GPCRs Nature. 2018; 557 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, in our bystander BRET assay, unlike for wild-type β 2 AR, we observed significant βarr2 recruitment to the plasma membrane by ISO-activated β 2 AR-365tr in the HEK GRK KO cells, despite the absence of GRK-mediated Rp tail phosphorylation ( Figures 6 B and 6C). This finding suggests that removal of the distal β 2 AR C tail leads to more efficient core engagement. Moreover, β 2 AR-365tr also recruited βarr2 more efficiently than wild-type receptor upon co-expression of GRK2 ( Figures 6 D and 6E), suggesting the possibility that an autoinhibitory role of the receptor C tail might still be operative even with Rp tail phosphorylation. Notably, wild-type β 2 AR and β 2 AR-365tr both were capable of surface recruitment of a G protein surrogate in an analogous bystander assay ( Figure S7 C), suggesting that the receptor autoinhibition is somehow more selective for βarr recruitment and activation. This assay was further leveraged to show that the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), which natively terminates after H8 and thus has no Rp tail, is able to recruit βarr2 in the HEK GRK KO cells in a GRK-independent manner similar to β 2 AR-365tr; βarr2 recruitment was also dramatically enhanced by co-expression of GRK2 ( Figures S7 A and S7D), likely due to GRK phosphorylation of sites in the 3 rd cytoplasmic loop of D2R ( Clayton et al., 2014 13. Clayton, C.C. ∙ Donthamsetti, P. ∙ Lambert, N.A. ... Mutation of three residues in the third intracellular loop of the dopamine D2 receptor creates an internalization-defective receptor J. Biol.

Section: Discussion

Single-molecule imaging has previously provided unprecedented insight into receptor dynamics and the receptor-mediated G protein activation mechanism ( Asher et al., 2021 3.

Studying GPCR conformational dynamics by single molecule fluorescence Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2019; 493 :110469 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2017 102. Zhu, Y. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Zhang, X.C. ... Structural dynamics of Giα protein revealed by single molecule FRET Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2017; 491 :603-608 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, smFRET investigations of βarr1 activation reveal that βarr1 resides in a highly stable, autoinhibited basal state, in which the middle βarr1 tail segment is tightly bound to its N-domain groove, thereby occluding receptor C-tail engagement. An important functional consequence of this autoinhibition is that phosphorylated receptor tail binding releases βarr1’s tail at a rate 2–3 orders of magnitude slower than diffusion. Moreover, substantial βarr1 tail displacement with pβ 2 V 2 R was only observed when the receptor was activated by agonist. These findings suggest that the Rp tail may be inaccessible or sterically constrained in the absence of receptor activation. Thus, in addition to agonist activation promoting receptor phosphorylation, we infer that efficient βarr engagement likely arises from agonist-induced accessibility of the Rp tail, stabilizing contacts facilitated by core engagement, and conformational changes in this “tight” complex. Such a mechanism would limit βarr engagement only to agonist-bound receptor, decreasing the potential impact of bystander phosphorylation. The receptor autoinhibition mechanism, combined with the autoinhibition of βarr itself, is likely to enhance the fidelity of βarr-mediated downstream signaling. Since βarr recruitment is impaired while G protein engagement seems unaffected, receptor C-tail autoinhibition may also play a role in biased agonism.
Whereas agonist binding and receptor phosphorylation cannot be deconvoluted in living cells, our cell-based experiments are consistent with an autoinhibitory role of the wild-type β 2 AR C tail for βarr recruitment that was relieved, at least in part, by partial truncation of the receptor tail. Indeed, D2R, which natively terminates after H8, can measurably recruit βarr2 in the GRK KO cells in the absence of GRK phosphorylation. A recent report also suggest an inhibitory role of the metabotropic glutamate 2 receptor C tail in βarr2 recruitment ( Abreu et al., 2021 1. Abreu, N. ∙ Acosta-Ruiz, A. ∙ Xiang, G. ... Mechanisms of differential desensitization of metabotropic glutamate receptors Cell Rep. 2021; 35 :109050 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the C-terminal region beyond H8 is unresolved in nearly all reported GPCR structural models. However, select structures of rhodopsin ( Nakamichi et al., 2007 66. Nakamichi, H. ∙ Buss, V. ∙ Okada, T. Photoisomerization mechanism of rhodopsin and 9-cis-rhodopsin revealed by x-ray crystallography Biophys.

Teller, D.C. ∙ Okada, T. ∙ Behnke, C.A. ... Advances in determination of a high-resolution three-dimensional structure of rhodopsin, a model of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) Biochemistry. 2001; 40 :7761-7772 Crossref Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ) have resolved a portion of the C terminus bound to both helix 8 and the intracellular face of the receptor, a position occupied by GRK1 in a recent structure of a GRK1:rhodopsin complex ( Chen et al., 2021b 11. Chen, Q. ∙ Plasencia, M. ∙ Li, Z. ... Structures of rhodopsin in complex with G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 Nature. 2021; 595 :600-605 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding of the receptor C terminus to this location would also likely inhibit βarr binding to the receptor core. Thus, a receptor C tail-dependent autoinhibition of βarr recruitment may be a mechanism shared by multiple GPCRs.
Structural studies of Fab30-stabilized receptor:βarr1 complexes have revealed βarr1 in both tail-only and tail-plus-core conformations. We find that Fab30 enables epi-activated phosphorylated receptor-mediated βarr1 tail release even when the receptor core is occupied by Nb6B9. Such a tail-only configuration of the receptor:βarr1:Nb6B9 complex would be analogous to the “megaplex” in which receptor is bound simultaneously to Gs in its TM core and to βarr1 in a tail-only conformation ( Nguyen et al., 2019 67. Nguyen, A.H. ∙ Thomsen, A.R.B. ∙ Cahill, T.J. ... Structure of an endosomal signaling GPCR-G protein-β-arrestin megacomplex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :1123-1131 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggest that tail-only engagement between receptor and βarr1 is transient in the absence of Fab30. Interestingly, a finger loop deletion mutation in βarr2 with reduced propensity to engage the receptor core—and that, in the presence of Fab30, promotes the tail-only interaction—is still able to mediate receptor internalization and signaling ( Cahill et al., 2017 8. Cahill, T.J. ∙ Thomsen, A.R.B. ∙ Tarrasch, J.T. ... Distinct conformations of GPCR-β-arrestin complexes mediate desensitization, signaling, and endocytosis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :2562-2567 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, a receptor mutant reported to be incapable of core engagement can also mediate receptor internalization ( Kumari et al., 2017 50. Kumari, P. ∙ Srivastava, A. ∙ Ghosh, E. ... Core engagement with β-arrestin is dispensable for agonist-induced vasopressin receptor endocytosis and ERK activation Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 :1003-1010 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings in living cells suggest that other effectors such as adaptin, clathrin, and/or lipid ( Eichel et al., 2018 19. Eichel, K. ∙ Jullié, D. ∙ Barsi-Rhyne, B. ... Catalytic activation of β-arrestin by GPCRs Nature. 2018; 557 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ; Staus et al., 2020 93.

Structure of the M2 muscarinic receptor-β-arrestin complex in a lipid nanodisc Nature. 2020; 579 :297-302 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ) contribute to the βarr-receptor interaction.
As the agonist-bound bpβ 2 V 2 R containing only four phosphorylated C-tail residues does not trigger appreciable βarr1 activation, or promote stable complex formation, despite the expectation that the receptor core should be able to engage βarr1, we infer that efficient βarr1 coupling to activated receptor requires a critical extent and/or pattern of phosphorylation within the Rp tail. Moreover, our cellular studies of βarr2 recruitment by distal C-tail truncated receptor support the broader conclusion that receptor-βarr-core-only interactions are quite weak, even when autoinhibition is partially relieved.
Cellular investigations implicate the βarr C tail in internalization as well as signaling processes downstream of receptor engagement ( Gurevich and Gurevich, 2015 26. Gurevich, V.V. ∙ Gurevich, E.V. Arrestins: critical players in trafficking of many gpcrs Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2015; 132 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Perry-Hauser et al., 2022 76. Perry-Hauser, N.A. ∙ Hopkins, J.B. ∙ Zhuo, Y. ... The two non-visual arrestins engage ERK2 differently J. Mol. Biol. 2022; 434 :167465 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). When βarr is activated, its C tail may sample an ensemble of positions on a sub-millisecond timescale or adopt a more limited set of positions that are partially stabilized by residual contacts with the βarr N- and C-terminal domains. Both models are consistent with increased βarr1 tail and/or fluorophore mobility upon activation as inferred from ensemble fluorescence anisotropy measurements ( Table S2 ).
Previous double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy measurements of βarr1 bound to light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin also predicted that position 392 in the middle βarr1 tail segment adopts a specific position ( Zhuo et al., 2014 104. Zhuo, Y. ∙ Vishnivetskiy, S.A. ∙ Zhan, X. ... Identification of receptor binding-induced conformational changes in non-visual arrestins J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :20991-21002 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), in contrast to the C tail in visual arrestin, which was disordered and dynamic ( Hanson et al., 2006 31. Hanson, S.M. ∙ Francis, D.J. ∙ Vishnivetskiy, S.A. ... Differential interaction of spin-labeled arrestin with inactive and active phosphorhodopsin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :4900-4905 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). From our observed time-averaged FRET efficiencies, we can estimate distance constraints to show that the βarr1 tail labeling site (residue 397) in the mid-FRET, active state should reside somewhere along a ring enclosing the intersection of the N and C domains of βarr1 ( Figure S5 C). DEER measurements for 12/392 and 192/392 also predict a location on a ring enclosing this intersection ( Figure S5 C). Combining these distance constraints limit the positions of residues 392 and 397 to a region between the N and C domains on the side of βarr1 that interacts with the third intracellular loop (IL3) of the receptor. In this context, we note that the low-FRET, active state observed in the presence of heparin likely reflects an extended tail conformation that positions 397 even further from both 176 and 110. We speculate that a potential interaction between the βarr tail and IL3, which is highly divergent among receptors, could also play a role in fine-tuning βarr activation and signaling.
Alternative βarr1 tail conformations could be stabilized and/or differentially recognized by effectors such as clathrin, adaptin, and various kinases, providing an important step toward a mechanistic understanding of the barcode hypothesis ( Dwivedi-Agnihotri et al., 2020 17.

By extension, distinct extents and patterns of receptor phosphorylation could differentially impact βarr activity ( Mayer et al., 2019 62. Mayer, D. ∙ Damberger, F.F. ∙ Samarasimhareddy, M. ...

USA. 2016; 113 :E8178-E8186 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional studies may reveal how the barcode is interpreted by βarr at the level of both conformational states and dynamics.
Inferring structural constraints from FRET efficiencies involves many assumptions and approximations ( Hellenkamp et al., 2018 33. Hellenkamp, B. ∙ Schmid, S. ∙ Doroshenko, O. ... Precision and accuracy of single-molecule FRET measurements-a multi-laboratory benchmark study Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :669-676 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lerner et al., 2021 57.

FRET-based dynamic structural biology: challenges, perspectives and an appeal for open-science practices eLife. 2021; 10 :e60416 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, additional experiments and simulations of βarr1 bound to V 2 Rpp or receptor are necessary to further define the structure of the distinct βarr1 active states that we have identified here using smFRET—and of the observed autoinhibitory mechanisms. The receptor utilized in the smFRET experiments was solubilized in detergent to facilitate comparison with existing structures ( Huang et al., 2020 38. Huang, W. ∙ Masureel, M. ∙ Qu, Q. ...

Biol. 2019; 26 :1123-1131 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet yielded results highly consistent with our cell-based studies. Future in vitro receptor studies in reconstituted membrane environments will likely be needed to recapitulate cellular regulation mechanisms that require βarr:membrane interactions, such as those with PIP 2 ( Eichel et al., 2018 19. Eichel, K. ∙ Jullié, D. ∙ Barsi-Rhyne, B. ... Catalytic activation of β-arrestin by GPCRs Nature. 2018; 557 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). We focused here on GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor C tail. Future studies should also address a potential role for other kinases, as well as for phosphorylation of intracellular loops, and differential roles of phosphorylation of distinct sets of sites by different GRKs ( Nobles et al., 2011 69. Nobles, K.N. ∙ Xiao, K. ∙ Ahn, S. ... Distinct phosphorylation sites on the β(2)-adrenergic receptor establish a barcode that encodes differential functions of β-arrestin Sci.

βarr variants were expressed in BL21-Gold competent E. coli cells (Agilent Technologies) and subsequently purified and labeled with fluorophores for TIRF- and confocal-based smFRET experiments. The cells were transformed with 1 ng of expression plasmid per manufacturer’s protocol and 100 μg/mL ampicillin was used for selection. Next, 70 mL Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was inoculated with a single bacterial colony and grown at 37 °C at 250 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.1-0.2. 15 mL of starter growth was then transferred to 1 L of LB and grown at 30 °C overnight at 250 rpm, followed by induction with 35 μM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 6 hours.
The N-terminal FLAG-tagged human β 2 V 2 R was co-expressed with or without GRK2-CAAX in Sf9 insect cells at 27 °C using Baculovirus Expression System as described previously ( Kahsai et al., 2016 45. Kahsai, A.W. ∙ Wisler, J.W. ∙ Lee, J. ... Conformationally selective RNA aptamers allosterically modulate the β2-adrenoceptor Nat. Chem.

Visualization of arrestin recruitment by a G-protein-coupled receptor Nature. 2014; 512 :218-222 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sixty-six hours post-infection, cells without GRK2-CAAX were immediately harvested for preparation of bpβ 2 V 2 R, and cells with coexpressed GRK2-CAAX were stimulated with isoproterenol at 37 °C to generate pβ 2 V 2 R, and then subsequently harvested.
The HEK293A GRK2/3/5/6 Knockout cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; corning), 1 X MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1 X sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1 X penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . 2.5 million cells were seeded in 10 cm tissue culture dishes 24 hours prior to transfection. The cells are female in origin and were authenticated by the Inoue lab using restriction enzyme-based genotyping and sequencing of the targeted loci and western blot analysis.
LD555p-MAL and LD655-MAL (Lumidyne Technologies) were reconstituted in DMSO at ∼10 mM concentration and stored at -20° C. NeutrAvidin (Thermo Scientific) was resuspended to a final concentration of 80 μM in T50 buffer with 10% glycerol, 100 μM 25 nucleotide duplex DNA (IDT), and 100 μM bovine serum albumin (EMD). The biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (biotin-AB2) (ThermoFisher Scientific) was reconstituted in 50% glycerol to a final concentration of 10 μM and stored at -20° C, as recommended by the manufacturer. The mouse high-affinity anti-Strep tag IgG1 monoclonal antibody (StrepMAB-Immo, IBA GmbH) was reconstituted in PBS at 1 μM concentration, flash frozen, and stored at -80° C as single use aliquots. V 2 Rpp, biotin-V 2 Rpp, V 2 Rnp, and V 2 Rbp were synthesized by the Tufts University peptide synthesis core facility. The peptides were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl at 2 mM final concentration, adjusted with 1M NaOH to pH ∼7, flash frozen, and stored at -80° C. Heparin (Sigma) was resuspended in water to 50 mg/mL (∼2.8 mM), filtered at 0.22 micron, and stored at 4°C. IP6 (Sigma) was resuspended in water to 1 mM and stored at -80°C. PIP2 (Echelon Biosciences) was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl to 2 mM and stored at -80°C. Carazolol (Sigma) was prepared as 100 μM stocks in DMSO. Fab30, Nb6B9, and Cmpd-6FA were prepared as previously described ( Liu et al., 2019 58. Liu, X. ∙ Masoudi, A. ∙ Kahsai, A.W. ...

Structure of active β-arrestin-1 bound to a G-protein-coupled receptor phosphopeptide Nature. 2013; 497 :137-141 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Epinephrine (Sigma) was prepared immediately before use at 200 mM in water and stored at 4° C. Glucose oxidase (Sigma) and catalase (Sigma) were each resuspended in T50 buffer with 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol, purified via size exclusion chromatography, concentrated, and stored at -20°C with 50% glycerol. Isoproterenol hydrochloride (Tocris Biosciences) was dissolved immediately before use in DPBS at 10 mM final concentration. Dopamine hydrochloride was dissolved immediately before use in ultrapure water at 22.22 mM with 40 mg/L sodium bisulfite.
Plasmids were constructed using standard techniques in molecular biology and confirmed by DNA sequencing (Psomagen). Briefly, a DNA insert flanked by Nco I and Avr II sites and coding for the Strep-tag followed by a linker region and then by the N-terminal region (residues 2–24) of bovine βarr1 was prepared by PCR amplification from two overlapping single-stranded oligonucleotides synthesized by ThermoFisher Scientific. The insert was cloned into the Nco I and Avr II sites of a previously described pTrcHisB vector coding cysteine-less βarr1, yielding the plasmid containing the complete coding region for Strep-tagged cysteine-less βarr1. Cysteine point mutations introduced for fluorophore labeling and the E313K mutation were prepared in the plasmid described above using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent). The 3-EI mutations and the R76A, K77A, D78A proximal finger loop mutations were introduced using a modified two-stage PCR protocol for site-directed mutagenesis ( Wang and Malcolm, 1999 99. Wang, W. ∙ Malcolm, B.A. Two-stage PCR protocol allowing introduction of multiple mutations, deletions and insertions using QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis BioTechniques. 1999; 26 :680-682 Crossref Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the live cell assays, the coding region of full length human β 2 AR, β 2 AR-365tr, and β 2 AR-341tr were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) expression vector with a signal peptide and SNAPfast tag at the receptor N-terminus.
Bacterial cells containing overexpressed βarr1 variants were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C and resuspended in 15 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 2 mM benzamidine (BA), 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mg/mL protease cocktail inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich), 10 mg/mL lysozyme (EMD Millipore), incubated on ice for 40 min, and frozen at ˗80 °C until further use.
After thawing, the cell suspension was supplemented with the following (final concentrations): 24 U/mL DNAse I (Sigma), 32 U/mL DNAse II (Sigma), 0.16 mg/mL RNAse A (Sigma), and 7 mM MgCl 2 and incubated on ice for 60 min. The cells were then lysed for five minutes at 500-1000 psi at 4° C using an EmulsiFlex-C3 Homogenizer (Avastin) per manufacturer’s protocol. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 90 min and the lysate was collected, followed by the addition 0.32 g ammonium sulfate per mL of lysate. The precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 90 minutes and frozen at -80° C until further use. Protein pellets were thawed on ice, dissolved in 10 mL of resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM BA, and 2 mM DTT), and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 90 minutes at 4° C to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was syringe filtered (0.8 μm, MilliPore) immediately before affinity purification.
For affinity purification, the supernatant described above was added to 3 mL of Strep-Tactin Superflow High Capacity resin (IBA GmbH) equilibrated with resuspension buffer and purified by gravity flow following a modified version of the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after loading filtered supernatant, the resin was washed with 30 mL resuspension buffer followed by elution with 20 mL of the same buffer containing 5 mM D-desthiobiotin (IBA GmbH). Eluted and purified βarr1 variants were concentrated using Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore Sigma) to a final volume of 250 μL and quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio Rad). Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis using standard protocols. Before use, βarr1 aliquots were thawed on ice and centrifuged for 1 hr at 100,000 x g and the top ∼25% of volume was extracted for use.
0.25 mg of the purified βarr1 variants in a total volume of ∼350 μL (∼15 μM protein) were labeled with 15.2 μM LD555p-MAL and 17.6 μM LD655-MAL in 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 750 mM NaCl at 4° C for 3 hr in the dark, followed by addition of 1 μL of 1 M DTT. To remove free dye, the solution was then loaded onto a Zeba™ 2 mL 7K MWCO spin desalting column (ThermoFisher) equilibrated in the buffer described above, and the resulting flow-through was loaded onto a second desalting column equilibrated in PBS, pH 7.0. The flow through containing pure labeled samples was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hr at 4° C to remove insoluble aggregates. Labeled βarr1 variants were aliquoted and frozen at -80° C until further use. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were also conducted using single-cysteine βarr1 variants labeled with LD555 or LD655 to verify that the fluorophores are not conformationally restricted ( Table S2 ).
Insect cells containing overexpressed pβ 2 V 2 R or bpβ 2 V 2 R were lysed using a lysis buffer [10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, benzamidine (10 mg/mL), leupeptin (10 mg/mL)] and subsequently solubilized in an n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM; Anatrace) containing solubilization buffer [1.0% DDM, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, benzamidine (10 mg/mL), leupeptin (10 mg/mL), PMSF (200 μmol)]. Functional bpβ 2 V 2 R and pβ 2 V 2 R were obtained in 0.01% (w/v) maltose neopentyl glycol (MNG) containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl buffer using a three-step affinity-chromatographic procedure: involving a first M1 anti-FLAG-antibody affinity column, followed by alprenolol-ligand column and a second M1 anti-FLAG antibody-affinity column. Purified receptors samples were either used fresh in the experiments or flash-frozen in small aliquots after addition of 15% glycerol and stored at −80 °C until further use. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the eight phosphorylated residues in the V 2 tail of the pβ 2 V 2 R, and the four such positions in bpβ 2 V 2 R,to be robustly (≥84%) phosphorylated ( Nguyen et al., 2019 67. Nguyen, A.H. ∙ Thomsen, A.R.B. ∙ Cahill, T.J. ... Structure of an endosomal signaling GPCR-G protein-β-arrestin megacomplex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :1123-1131 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Microfluidic imaging chambers were prepared by passivating quartz glass slides and coverslips with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and biotin-PEG ( Blanchard et al., 2004 5. Blanchard, S.C. ∙ Gonzalez, R.L. ∙ Kim, H.D. ... tRNA selection and kinetic proofreading in translation Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11 :1008-1014 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). For direct immobilization of βarr1 variants, the imaging surface was first exposed to 0.8 μM NeutrAvidin, followed by 100 nM biotin-AB and then 10 nM StrepMAB-Immo in T50 buffer (10 mM Tris-Acetate, 50 mM KCl). The surface was then exchanged into imaging buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.8% (w/v) glucose). Strep-tagged βarr1 variants were incubated at 200 pM within the imaging chamber for 5 minutes in imaging buffer with 2 μM 25-nucleotide DNA duplex (IDT) and 2 μM BSA (EM-2930, VWR) as surface blocking agents. For experiments tethering βarr1 to the surface via V 2 Rpp interactions, a complex of biotin-V 2 Rpp and βarr1 was formed at a 1:2 molar ratio with 100 nM Fab30 for 10 min prior to injection into the imaging chamber treated with NeutrAvidin only. Imaging was performed in imaging buffer containing glucose oxidase (2.5 U/mL) and catalase (1.75 U/μL), which was incubated for 5 minutes in a glass syringe and 5 minutes in the microfluidic chamber, unless otherwise noted. Where specified, MNG-solubilized receptor was diluted to the final concentration in imaging buffer with any receptor ligands for 5 min to form a stable complex and this mixture was injected into the imaging chamber at the specified concentrations without additional detergent.
TIRF-based smFRET imaging experiments were performed at 25° C with a custom-built TIRF microscope ( Juette et al., 2016 41. Juette, M.F. ∙ Terry, D.S. ∙ Wasserman, M.R. ... Single-molecule imaging of non-equilibrium molecular ensembles on the millisecond timescale Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :341-344 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). LD555p fluorophores attached to βarr1 variants near the surface were illuminated with a 532 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (Opus, LaserQuantum). Fluorescence emission from LD555p and LD655 was collected by a 60X, 1.27 NA super resolution water immersion objective (Nikon), passed through a ET550lp filter (Chroma) to remove excitation light, spectrally split in a MultiCam Device (Cairn) with a 640lpxr dichroic filter (Chroma), passed through additional bandpass filters (ET585/65 and ET685/50, Chroma), and finally projected onto two synchronized ORCA-Fusion sCMOS cameras (C14440-20UP, Hamamatsu) with 2x2 pixel binning. Unless otherwise specified, recordings were made at a 10 s -1 frame rate (100 ms time resolution) in the “standard” readout mode. Instrument control was performed with in-house developed software written in LabVIEW.
Wide-field movies were analyzed with SPARTAN version 3.7 ( Juette et al., 2016 41. Juette, M.F. ∙ Terry, D.S. ∙ Wasserman, M.R. ... Single-molecule imaging of non-equilibrium molecular ensembles on the millisecond timescale Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :341-344 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, molecules were detected as local intensity maxima in an image composed of the sum of donor and acceptor channels (aligned using the iterative closest points algorithm) averaged over the first 10 frames and background subtracted. Molecules closer than 3.5 pixels were excluded from analysis. Traces were extracted from the selected intensity maxima by summing the 9 most intense pixels on each fluorescence channel. The arbitrary pixel intensity units were converted to approximate photon counts using the conversion factor provided by the manufacturer with each camera. Each trace was then baseline subtracted by using the intensity levels in each channel after donor photobleaching. Finally, traces were corrected for donor to acceptor channel crosstalk, unequal apparent brightness of donor and acceptor fluorophores, and acceptor direct excitation ( Hellenkamp et al., 2018 33. Hellenkamp, B. ∙ Schmid, S. ∙ Doroshenko, O. ... Precision and accuracy of single-molecule FRET measurements-a multi-laboratory benchmark study Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :669-676 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). Corrected FRET values (E) were then used for estimating inter-dye distances (R) using the following equation and an R 0 of 62 Å ( Girodat et al., 2020 23. Girodat, D. ∙ Pati, A.K. ∙ Terry, D.S. ... Quantitative comparison between sub-millisecond time resolution single-molecule FRET measurements and 10-second molecular simulations of a biosensor protein PLoS Comput. Biol. 2020; 16 :e1008293 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). 𝑅 = 𝑅 0 6 √ ( 1 − 𝐸 ) / 𝐸
Inherent in this calculation are many assumptions, including rapid isotropic tumbling of the fluorophores. As such, calculated inter-dye distance estimates are approximations to the true inter-dye distances. One important assumption is that the fluorophores are freely tumbling ( Lakowicz, 2006 51. Lakowicz, J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy Springer, 2006 Crossref Scopus (16884) Google Scholar ). Along these lines, we would like to point out that the LD555p and LD655 fluorophores have long (13 atoms) linkers to minimize any possible restrictions on fluorophore tumbling and a number of polar groups to minimize any possible hydrophobic interactions with the protein. Explicit solvent, full potential MD simulations with these fluorophores attached to a protein of similar size to βarr1 showed minimal protein-fluorophore interactions and estimated κ 2 to be near to the ideal value ( Girodat et al., 2020 23. Girodat, D. ∙ Pati, A.K. ∙ Terry, D.S. ... Quantitative comparison between sub-millisecond time resolution single-molecule FRET measurements and 10-second molecular simulations of a biosensor protein PLoS Comput. Biol. 2020; 16 :e1008293 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Traces were selected for further analysis if they met the following criteria for experiments recorded with 100 ms (10 ms) time resolution: SNR BG > 20 (15), FRET lifetime > 50 (20) frames (using a threshold of 0.08 FRET), donor acceptor correlation coefficient < 0.5, donor fluorophore blinking events < 4, single step photobleaching, and mean total intensity (donor + acceptor) over the first 10 frames within two standard deviations from the mean. State assignment from smFRET traces was accomplished using the segmental K-means algorithm ( Qin, 2004 77. Qin, F. Restoration of single-channel currents using the segmental k-means method based on hidden Markov modeling Biophys. J. 2004; 86 :1488-1501 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a 4-state linear model with the following mean (± S.D.) starting values: 0 (0.06), 0.16 (0.06), 0.46 (0.06), 0.72 (0.06) and rate constants set at 1 s -1 . For dwell-time histograms and maximum likelihood analysis of the dynamic sampling of mid- and high-FRET states, traces were selected if their mean FRET values were within 0.1 of the ensemble average and there were at least 100 frames (10 seconds) in the mid- and high-FRET states. Dwell-time histograms are normalized as the number of dwells within each duration bin divided by the total imaging time, giving units of dwells per second. This approach ensures that (1) the histogram does not over-emphasize spurious events in conditions for which conformational transitions are very rare, (2) that the y axis height is directly related to the frequency of each transition type, and (3) that the histogram is minimally sensitive to any variation in the number of molecules contributing to the experiment and the photobleaching rate.
Transition density plots and dwell-time histograms represent data from full length traces. Mean state occupancies and FRET histograms are obtained from the first 100 frames. Rate constants were estimated using the maximum interval likelihood algorithm ( Qin et al., 1997 78. Qin, F. ∙ Auerbach, A. ∙ Sachs, F. Maximum likelihood estimation of aggregated Markov processes Proceedings of the Royal Society B. 1997; 264 :375-383 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Confocal-based single-molecule FRET measurements were performed using a MicroTime 200 equipped with a HydraHarp 400 counting module (PicoQuant). The donor and acceptor dyes were alternatively excited with a pulsed interleaved excitation scheme ( Müller et al., 2005 65. Müller, B.K. ∙ Zaychikov, E. ∙ Bräuchle, C. ... Pulsed interleaved excitation Biophys. J. 2005; 89 :3508-3522 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ) with light from a 531 nm (LDH-P-FA-530L, PicoQuant) and a 639 nm (D-C-640, PicoQuant) diode laser, each operated at 20 MHz frequency, with an average power of 50 and 25μW at the sample, respectively. Emitted photons were collected by the microscope objective (Olympus UPlanSApo 60x/1.20 W), focused onto a 100-μm pinhole, and then separated into four channels with a polarizing beam splitter and two dichroic mirrors (T635lpxr, Chroma). Emission was additionally filtered by bandpass filters (ET585/65M and H690/70, Chroma) before being focused onto one of four single-photon avalanche detectors (Excelitas SPCM-AQRH-TR).
FRET efficiency histograms of doubly labelled and freely diffusing βarr1 were acquired at a concentration of 50-100 pM in the presence of 0.01% Tween 20 (Pierce) to minimize surface adhesion ( Schuler, 2007 86. Schuler, B. Application of single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer to protein folding Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 350 :115-138 PubMed Google Scholar ). The data were collected for 1-8 hrs. To ensure consistency with TIRF experiments, confocal FRET experiments were carried out in the same microfluidic channels used for wide-field TIRF measurements.
Fluorescence bursts were identified by combining successive photons separated by 100 μs or less ( Eggeling et al., 2001 18. Eggeling, C. ∙ Berger, S. ∙ Brand, L. ... Data registration and selective single-molecule analysis using multi-parameter fluorescence detection J. Biotechnol. 2001; 86 :163-180 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ), and events comprising 40 to 60 or more photons were kept for analysis. Average FRET efficiencies were obtained from 𝐸 = 𝑁 𝑑 𝐴 / ( 𝑁 𝑑 𝐷 + 𝑁 𝑑 𝐴 ) in which 𝑁 𝑑 𝐷 and 𝑁 𝑑 𝐴 are the numbers of donor ( D ) and acceptor ( A ) photons, respectively, in each burst after donor excitation ( d ), corrected for background, channel crosstalk 𝛼 and acceptor direct excitation 𝛿 , defined as 𝛼 = 𝐸 𝐷 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 / ( 1 − 𝐸 𝐷 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ) and 𝛿 = 𝑆 𝐴 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 / ( 1 − 𝑆 𝐴 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ) , where 𝐸 𝐷 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 is the average apparent FRET efficiency ( E ) of molecules containing only an active donor fluorophore, and 𝑆 𝐴 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 is the average apparent stoichiometry ratio ( S ) of molecules containing only an active acceptor fluorophore, with S defined as ( 𝑁 𝑑 𝐷 + 𝑁 𝑑 𝐴 ) / ( 𝑁 𝑑 𝐷 + 𝑁 𝑑 𝐴 + 𝑁 𝑎 𝐴 ) , in which 𝑁 𝑎 𝐴 represents the emission of acceptor photons after direct acceptor excitation ( a ) at 639 nm ( Lee et al., 2005 55. Lee, N.K. ∙ Kapanidis, A.N. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Accurate FRET measurements within single diffusing biomolecules using alternating-laser excitation Biophys. J. 2005; 88 :2939-2953 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cross-talk- and direct excitation-corrected average 𝐸 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 and 𝑆 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 need to be further corrected to account for the relative excitation efficiency of the two fluorophores, 𝛽 , and the relative quantum yields and detection efficiencies for donor and acceptor emission γ: with 𝛽 = 𝐼 𝑎 ⁢ 𝜀 𝐴 / 𝐼 𝑑 ⁢ 𝜀 𝐷 , where 𝐼 𝑎 , 𝑑 are the relative powers of the acceptor and donor excitation lasers, and 𝜀 𝐴 , 𝐷 are the extinction coefficients of the acceptor and donor fluorophores at their respective excitation wavelengths; and 𝛾 = 𝜑 𝐴 ⁢ 𝜂 𝐴 / 𝜑 𝐷 ⁢ 𝜂 𝐷 , where 𝜑 𝐴 , 𝐷 are the quantum yields of acceptor and donor, and 𝜂 𝐴 , 𝐷 are the detection efficiencies for acceptor and acceptor photons, respectively. The values of β and γ have been determined from the dependence of 𝑆 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 on 𝐸 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 using three subpopulations with different donor–acceptor distances, according to 𝑆 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 = ( 1 + 𝛾 ⁢ 𝛽 + 𝛽 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝛾 ) ⁢ 𝐸 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 ) − 1 ( Holmstrom et al., 2018 37. Holmstrom, E.D. ∙ Holla, A. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Accurate transfer efficiencies, distance distributions, and ensembles of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins From single-molecule FRET Methods Enzymol. 2018; 611 :287-325 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2005 55. Lee, N.K. ∙ Kapanidis, A.N. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Accurate FRET measurements within single diffusing biomolecules using alternating-laser excitation Biophys. J. 2005; 88 :2939-2953 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). These two correction factors were then used to calculate the average FRET efficiency 𝐸 and stoichiometry ratio 𝑆 as expressed above.
FCS data were acquired at a concentration of 0.5-2 nM of the freely diffusing labeled βarr1 and an excess of the partner to saturate binding. Donor and acceptor fluorescence emission after continuous-wave excitation at 532 nm was focused onto a 50-μm pinhole, recorded with two detectors each and summed before being cross-correlated between 1 μs and 1 s with logarithmically spaced time steps. The resulting fluorescence intensity cross-correlations, 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) , between donor and acceptor signal were fitted with a model including translational diffusion and triplet blinking to determine the diffusion time, 𝜏 𝐷 , through the confocal volume: 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) = 1 𝑁 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝜏 𝜏 𝐷 ) − 1 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑠 2 ⁢ 𝜏 𝜏 𝐷 ) − 1 / 2 ⁢ ( 1 + 𝑐 𝑇 ⁢ e x p ⁡ [ − 𝜏 𝜏 𝑇 ] ) , where N is the average number of labeled molecules in the confocal volume, s is the ratio of the lateral to the axial radii of the confocal volume, and 𝜏 𝑇 is the correlation time of triplet blinking.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed in a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern) at 25° C. The plasmid coding for wild type βarr1 and its purification were described previously ( Nobles et al., 2007 68. Nobles, K.N. ∙ Guan, Z. ∙ Xiao, K. ... The active conformation of beta-arrestin1: direct evidence for the phosphate sensor in the N-domain and conformational differences in the active states of β-arrestins1 and -2 J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :21370-21381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both wildtype βarr1 and V 2 Rpp were dialyzed in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 125 mM NaCl, TCEP (10 μM). βarr1 (25 μM) was loaded into the sample cell and V 2 Rpp (250 μM) into the injection syringe. Titrations were initiated by a 0.4 μL injection from syringe, followed by 19 injections of 2.0 μL at 150 s intervals. During the experiment, the reference power was set to 7 μcal·s -1 and the sample cell was stirred continuously at 750 rpm. Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression using the MicroCal PEAQ-ITC analysis software (Malvern).
A βarr1 model in the basal state matching the sequence of the bovine cysteine-less βarr1 construct used in the experimental studies was constructed by homology modeling with Modeller (v10.0) ( Eswar et al., 2006 20. Eswar, N. ∙ Webb, B. ∙ Marti-Renom, M.A. ... Comparative protein structure modeling using Modeller Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics Chapter. 2006; 5 Unit 5.6 PubMed Google Scholar ), using a selected set of crystal structures of βarr1 as templates. These structures include βarr1 (PDB 1JSY ) ( Milano et al., 2002 64. Milano, S.K. ∙ Pace, H.C. ∙ Kim, Y.-M. ... Scaffolding functions of arrestin-2 revealed by crystal structure and mutagenesis Biochemistry. 2002; 41 :3321-3328 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ) (the main template for residues up to 399), βarr1 (PDB 1ZSH ) ( Milano et al., 2006 63. Milano, S.K. ∙ Kim, Y.M. ∙ Stefano, F.P. ... Nonvisual arrestin oligomerization and cellular localization are regulated by inositol hexakisphosphate binding J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :9812-9823 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) (which includes the key interaction R7-E389 missing in 1JSY), βarr1 in complex with M2 muscarinic receptor PDB 6U1N ( Staus et al., 2020 93. Staus, D.P. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of the M2 muscarinic receptor-β-arrestin complex in a lipid nanodisc Nature. 2020; 579 :297-302 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ) (the template for loop residues 331 to 339 and 356 to 364), visual arrestin (PDB 1CF1 ) ( Hirsch et al., 1999 36. Hirsch, J.A. ∙ Schubert, C. ∙ Gurevich, V.V. ... A model for arrestin’s regulation: the 2.8 Å crystal structure of visual arrestin Cell. 1999; 97 :257-269 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) (the homologous template for residues 400 to 404). Parts without any template, i.e., residues 1 to 5, 365 to 382, and 405 to 418 were ab initio modeled with Modeller.
In modeling the β 2 V 2 R-βarr1 complex, we used the cryo-EM structure of β 1 V 2 R-βarr1 (PDB 6TKO ) ( Lee et al., 2020 56. Lee, Y. ∙ Warne, T. ∙ Nehmé, R. ... Molecular basis of β-arrestin coupling to formoterol-bound β1-adrenoceptor Nature. 2020; 583 :862-866 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ) as the main template instead of the available β 2 AR-G protein structures, considering the different orientations of TM5-IL3-TM6 in accommodating G protein versus arrestin and the high homology between β 2 AR and β 1 AR. Additional structures were also used for different parts of the model. The structure PDB 6U1N provided the template for the missing residues 331-340 in βarr1 of 6TKO. Two β 2 AR structures were also included: the structure PDB 4LDO ( Ring et al., 2013 81. Ring, A.M. ∙ Manglik, A. ∙ Kruse, A.C. ... Adrenaline-activated structure of β2-adrenoceptor stabilized by an engineered nanobody Nature. 2013; 502 :575-579 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used specifically as the template for TM1, which has noticeable divergence between β 2 AR and β 1 AR, while the structure 6TKO misses two extracellular turns in TM1; 4LDO also provided the epinephrine bound in the binding site; the structure PDB 3SN6 ( Rasmussen et al., 2011 80. Rasmussen, S.G.F. ∙ DeVree, B.T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex Nature. 2011; 477 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (2143) PubMed Google Scholar ) is five residues longer at the C-terminal end of TM5 than 6TKO. Similar to our βarr1 model in the basal state, we matched the sequence of the receptor and βarr1 in the complex to the β 2 V 2 R ( Shukla et al., 2014 89. Shukla, A.K. ∙ Westfield, G.H. ∙ Xiao, K. ... Visualization of arrestin recruitment by a G-protein-coupled receptor Nature. 2014; 512 :218-222 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the bovine cysteine-less βarr1 constructs used in the experimental studies. 200 models were generated with Modeller. These models include the complete IL3 that does not have a template for residues 240 to 262, and the complete V 2 Rpp that does not have a template for residues 342 to 354. The resulting model with the lowest DOPE score was selected for the following steps.
Based on the selected Modeller model, for the IL3 portion lacking any template and its nearby residues (residues 236 to 263) and the V 2 Rpp portion (residues 342 to 355) that has no template, we remodeled them with the next-generation kinematic closure (NGK) protocol implemented in ROSETTA (version 2019.47.61047) ( Stein and Kortemme, 2013 95. Stein, A. ∙ Kortemme, T. Improvements to robotics-inspired conformational sampling in rosetta PLoS One. 2013; 8 :e63090 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), which considers the context of conformational sampling of local regions, in this case, the nearby regions of receptor and the bound βarr1. We used the NGK protocol with default options to generate 20,000 models for each modelled loop and integrated the lowest-scoring models in the final complex model to build the simulation system.
The selected βarr1 model was processed by the Protein Preparation Wizard of Schrodinger Suite (version 2021-1). The first and last residues of this model are in positively and negatively charged states, respectively, without capping, as assumed in their natural condition. The prepared model was then immersed in a simulation water box using the System Builder of Schrodinger Suite (version 2021-1). Na + and Cl - ions were added to neutralize the system, and to make the salt concentration of the system 0.15 M. The total system size was ∼143,000 atoms.
The selected β 2 V 2 R-βarr1 complex model was processed by the Protein Preparation Wizard. The sidechains of D79 2.50 and D130 3.49 of the receptor were protonated to their neutral forms as assumed in the active state of aminergic GPCRs ( Dror et al., 2011 16. Dror, R.O. ∙ Arlow, D.H. ∙ Maragakis, P. ... Activation mechanism of the β2-adrenergic receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :18684-18689 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, E122 3.41 , a residue facing lipids, was also protonated to its neutral form. The resulting model was then placed into explicit 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid bilayer (POPC) using the orientation of the structure 4LDO from the Orientation of Proteins in Membranes database ( Borroto-Escuela and Fuxe, 2019 6. Borroto-Escuela, D.O. ∙ Fuxe, K. Oligomeric receptor complexes and their allosteric receptor-receptor interactions in the plasma membrane represent a new biological principle for integration of signals in the CNS Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2019; 12 :230 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lomize et al., 2006 60. Lomize, M.A. ∙ Lomize, A.L. ∙ Pogozheva, I.D. ... OPM: orientations of proteins in membranes database Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :623-625 Crossref Scopus (848) PubMed Google Scholar ). Simple point charge (SPC) water model was used to solvate the system, charges were neutralized, and 0.15M NaCl was added. The total system size was ∼179,000 atoms.
MD simulations were carried out using Desmond MD System (version 6.1; D.E. Shaw Research, New York, NY) ( Bowers et al., 2006 7. Bowers, K. ∙ Chow, E. ∙ Xu, H. ... Scalable algorithms for molecular dynamics simulations on commodity clusters ACM/IEEE SC 2006 Conference (SC’06) IEEE Publications, 2006; 43 Crossref Google Scholar ) with the OPLS4 force field ( Lu et al., 2021 61. Lu, C. ∙ Wu, C. ∙ Ghoreishi, D. ... OPLS4: improving force field accuracy on challenging regimes of chemical space J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021; 17 :4291-4300 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). The simulation systems were minimized and equilibrated with restraints on the ligand heavy atoms and the protein backbone. For both the equilibrations and the following production runs, the constant temperature 310 K was maintained by Langevin dynamics, 1 atm constant pressure was achieved with the Langevin piston method ( Feller et al., 1995 21. Feller, S.E. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Pastor, R.W. ... Constant pressure molecular dynamics simulation: the Langevin piston method J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103 :4613-4621 Crossref Google Scholar ). A cutoff distance of 9 Å was used for the nonbonded interactions, and the particle-mesh Ewald summation method was used for the electrostatics interactions. The integration timestep was set to 2.5 fs. For the βarr1 simulations in a water box, the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble was used in a periodic boundary condition. For the β 2 V 2 R-βarr1 simulations in a lipid bilayer, The NPγT ensemble (the pressure treatment on the z direction (membrane normal axis) is decoupled from those of the x and y directions) was used on an anisotropic flexible periodic cell with a constant ratio of the x-y plane. The production runs of βarr simulations are without any restraints, those of β 2 V 2 R-βarr1 complex are restrained in the C domain of arrestin (Cα atoms of residue 231-239) and near ligand binding site on the extracellular side of the receptor TM domain (Cα atoms of 30 residues), to retain the orientation between the receptor and βarr1 observed in the structure 6TKO, without any restraints near the receptor-arrestin interface.
The analysis and visualization were performed with VMD ( Humphrey et al., 1996 39. Humphrey, W. ∙ Dalke, A. ∙ Schulten, K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 :27 Google Scholar ) and PyMol (Schrodinger).
Representative frames from the above MD simulations corresponding to the two distinct basal state βarr1 conformations ( Figures 1 B and 1C) were selected for estimating inter-dye distances. Residues 176 and 397 of βarr1 were substituted for cysteine and LD555p and LD655 fluorophore models with 13-atom linkers were attached at these respective positions via the thiol-maleimide bond using PyMol version 1.4.1. Fluorophore models were constructed and geometries optimized with Avogadro version 1.2.0 ( Hanwell et al., 2012 32. Hanwell, M.D. ∙ Curtis, D.E. ∙ Lonie, D.C. ... Avogadro: an advanced semantic chemical editor, visualization, and analysis platform J. Cheminform. 2012; 4 :17 Crossref Scopus (3916) PubMed Google Scholar ). Coordinate and topology files for the structure-based models were constructed using SMOG version 2.2 ( Noel et al., 2016 70. Noel, J.K. ∙ Levi, M. ∙ Raghunathan, M. ... SMOG 2: a versatile software package for generating structure-based models PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12 :e1004794 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. Simulations were performed using GROMACS version 2019 ( Hess et al., 2008 34. Hess, B. ∙ Kutzner, C. ∙ van der Spoel, D. ... GROMACS 4: algorithms for highly efficient, load-balanced, and scalable molecular simulation J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2008; 4 :435-447 Crossref Scopus (11733) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following steepest-descent equilibration with 10 million timesteps, the simulation was run for 95 million timesteps of size 0.005 with frames saved every 1,000 timesteps. Frames were aligned using the protein portion and the inter-dye distances were measured between the center carbon of each fluorophore’s polymethine chain, and these distances were then averaged across all frames.
With this approach, the conformation of βarr1 is maintained by a harmonic potential on native contacts within the structure. By contrast, the fluorophores and linkers are not subject to these constraints, enabling them to explore all accessible volume. The resulting ensemble of fluorophore positions serves as an approximation to the experimental ensemble that gives rise to the observed FRET efficiencies. While these simplified, structure-based potential simulations do not capture all contributors to fluorophore positions and dynamics, they have been shown to provide good correspondence to smFRET experiments with a protein of similar size to βarr1 ( Girodat et al., 2020 23. Girodat, D. ∙ Pati, A.K. ∙ Terry, D.S. ... Quantitative comparison between sub-millisecond time resolution single-molecule FRET measurements and 10-second molecular simulations of a biosensor protein PLoS Comput. Biol. 2020; 16 :e1008293 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All live-cell assays were carried out in the HEK293A GRK2/3/5/6 knockout cells. For the bystander BRET assay, cells were measured 24 hours post transient transfection using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per manufacturer’s protocol. For this assay, plasmids coding for receptor (2 μg), Rluc8-βarr2 (0.25 μg), mem-citrine (13 μg), and either non-coding plasmid (pcDNA5 FRT, 5 μg) or GRK2 (5 μg) were transfected. The transfected cells were prepared in a 96-well microplate format and assayed as described previously using a Pherastar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech) ( Donthamsetti et al., 2015 15. Donthamsetti, P. ∙ Quejada, J.R. ∙ Javitch, J.A. ... Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70 :2.14.1-2.14.14 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). After incubation with coelenterazine H (5 μM, Dalton Pharma Services) for 8 minutes, ISO or dopamine was injected to stimulate the β2AR variants or D2R, respectively. BRET measurements were acquired 10 minutes post injection of agonists. Data analysis was carried out as described previously ( Donthamsetti et al., 2015 15. Donthamsetti, P. ∙ Quejada, J.R. ∙ Javitch, J.A. ... Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70 :2.14.1-2.14.14 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine receptor surface expression in the bystander BRET assay, live cells transfected as described above were incubated with 1 μM SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 647 in complete tissue culture media for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 to label the N-terminal SNAP tags of the β2AR variants. After labeling, the cells were washed three times with media, twice with DPBS, then harvested and resuspended in DPBS supplemented with 5 mM glucose. The number of cells in the resulting suspension was measured using the Countess II cell counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Using a Pherastar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech), the same cell suspension transferred to black bottom 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) excited with 640 nm light to detect fluorescence (680 nm) from labeled receptors. Surface expression was determined by calculating the ratio of fluorescence from Alexa Fluor 647-labeled receptors by the measured number of cells.
For the bystander mini-Gs assay, cells were propagated in plastic flasks and on 6-well plates 24 hr prior to transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids coding for NES-NanoLuc-mGs ( Wan et al., 2018 98. Wan, Q. ∙ Okashah, N. ∙ Inoue, A. ... Mini G protein probes for active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in live cells J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :7466-7473 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), venus-kras ( Lan et al., 2011 52. Lan, T.-H. ∙ Kuravi, S. ∙ Lambert, N.A. Internalization dissociates β2-adrenergic receptors PLoS One. 2011; 6 :e17361 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), β 2 AR receptors variants, and GRK2 (or pcDNA3.1(+) control) in a (1:20:4:10) ratio using linear polyethyleneimine MAX (Polysciences) and were used for experiments 24 hr later. To measure BRET signals, cells were washed with DPBS, harvested by trituration, and transferred to opaque black 96-well plates containing diluted drug solutions. Furimazine (Nano-Glo; 1:1000, Promega Corporation) was added to all wells immediately prior to making measurements. BRET measurements were made using a Mithras LB940 photon-counting plate reader (Berthold Technologies GmbH, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Raw BRET signals were calculated as the emission intensity at 520-545 nm divided by the emission intensity at 475-495 nm.
For TIRF smFRET experiments, each replicate (n) corresponds to a single movie recorded in a distinct microfluidic chamber, typically on distinct days using a distinct aliquot of each reagent. Data are displayed as the mean across replicates and error bars represent the standard deviation across replicates. Inclusion criteria for smFRET traces is described above in the section titled “Analysis of TIRF-based single-molecule recordings”. Plotting, distribution fitting and statistics for all TIRF smFRET data were carried out using OriginPro 2020b (OriginLab).
Confocal single-molecule FRET and FCS data were analyzed with Fretica, a custom WSTP software package for Mathematica (Wolfram Research).
Data from the BRET-based live cell assays were plotted and fit using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). To determine p values, an unpaired two-sided Mann-Whitney test was used, where comparison with p > 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical details of experiments can be found in the figure legends.
