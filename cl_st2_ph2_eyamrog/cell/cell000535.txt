Title: SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-B.1.1.529 leads to widespread escape from neutralizing antibody responses


Abstract: Summary

On 24 th November 2021, the sequence of a new SARS-CoV-2 viral isolate Omicron-B.1.1.529 was announced, containing far more mutations in Spike (S) than previously reported variants. Neutralization titers of Omicron by sera from vaccinees and convalescent subjects infected with early pandemic Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta are substantially reduced, or the sera failed to neutralize. Titers against Omicron are boosted by third vaccine doses and are high in both vaccinated individuals and those infected by Delta. Mutations in Omicron knock out or substantially reduce neutralization by most of the large panel of potent monoclonal antibodies and antibodies under commercial development. Omicron S has structural changes from earlier viruses and uses mutations that confer tight binding to ACE2 to unleash evolution driven by immune escape. This leads to a large number of mutations in the ACE2 binding site and rebalances receptor affinity to that of earlier pandemic viruses.

Section: Introduction

Since the end of 2020, a series of viral variants have been emerging in different regions, and some have caused large outbreaks. Alpha ( Supasa et al., 2021 52.

Public Health. 2021; 18 :4172 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), despite causing large outbreaks in Southern Africa and South America, did not become dominant in other parts of the world. Indeed, Beta was later displaced by Delta in South Africa.
The rapid emergence of Omicron ( https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern ) in the background of high Beta immunity implies that the virus may have evolved to escape neutralization by Beta-specific serum ( Liu et al., 2021b 33. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within Spike (S), Omicron has 30 substitutions plus a deletion of 6 and an insertion of 3 residues, whereas in all the other proteins there are a total of 16 substitutions and 7 residue deletions. Particular hotspots for the mutations are the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding domain (RBD) (15 amino acid substitutions) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) (3 deletions totaling 6 residues, 1 insertion, and 4 substitutions).
S mediates cellular interactions. It is a dynamic, trimeric structure ( Walls et al., 2017 55. Walls, A.C. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Snijder, J. ...

Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the Prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), which can be lipid bound ( Toelzer et al., 2020 53. Toelzer, C. ∙ Gupta, K. ∙ Yadav, S.K.N. ... Free fatty acid binding pocket in the locked structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Science. 2020; 370 :725-730 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tightly associated in a “closed” form or unfurled to expose one or more RBDs, allowing both receptor binding and increased access to neutralizing antibodies. Once bound to a cell, S undergoes cleavage and a drastic elongation, converting it to the post-fusion form.
Most potent neutralizing antibodies target the ACE2 footprint ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 14. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ...

A proportion of antibodies are able to cross-neutralize different variants ( Liu et al., 2021b 33. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a few of these bind to a motif surrounding the N-linked glycan at residue 343 ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 14. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ... The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain Cell. 2021; 184 :2183-2200.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2021b 33.

The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). These latter antibodies, exemplified by S309 ( Pinto et al., 2020 40. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ), can cross-react with SARS-CoV-1 but do not block ACE2 interaction, and destabilizing the S-trimer may be their mechanism of action. Neutralizing anti-NTD mAbs do not block ACE2 interaction and bind to a so-called supersite on the NTD ( Cerutti et al., 2021 9. Cerutti, G. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Zhou, T. ... Potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies directed against spike N-terminal domain target a single supersite Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 29 :819-833.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chi et al., 2020 10.

A neutralizing human antibody binds to the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :650-655 Crossref Scopus (951) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, they generally fail to provide a broad protection as the supersite is disrupted by a variety of NTD mutations present in the variants of concern (VOC). Moreover, some NTD-binding antibodies were shown to have an infectivity-enhancing effect by inducing the open form of S ( Liu et al., 2021c 34. Liu, Y. ∙ Soh, W.T. ∙ Kishikawa, J.I. ... An infectivity-enhancing site on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein targeted by antibodies Cell. 2021; 184 :3452-3466.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this report, we study the neutralization of Omicron by a large panel of sera collected from convalescents of early pandemic, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-infected individuals, together with vaccinees who had received three doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222) or the Pfizer BioNtech (BNT16b2) vaccines. There is a widespread reduction in the neutralization activity of sera from multiple sources, and we use these data to plot an antigenic map, where Omicron is seen to occupy the most distant position from early pandemic viruses, which form the basis for current vaccines.
We show that Omicron escapes neutralization by the majority of potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) arising after both early pandemic and infection with Beta variant. Utilizing a large bank of structures (n = 29) from panels of potent mAbs, which includes most of the mAbs developed for prophylactic or therapeutic use, we describe the mechanism of escape caused by the numerous mutations present in Omicron RBD ( Baum et al., 2020 4. Baum, A. ∙ Fulton, B.O. ∙ Wloga, E. ... Antibody cocktail to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prevents rapid mutational escape seen with individual antibodies Science. 2020; 369 :1014-1018 Crossref Scopus (877) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Analysis of the binding of ACE2 to RBD and structural analysis of the Omicron RBD indicate that changes at residues 498 and 501 of the RBD have locked ACE2 binding to the RBD in that region sufficiently strongly to enable the generation of a plethora of less favorable changes elsewhere, providing extensive immune escape and, in the process, resulting in a final net affinity for ACE2 similar to the early pandemic virus.

Section: Results

Omicron has changes throughout its proteome, but S changes dominate, with 30 amino acid substitutions plus 6 residues deleted and 3 inserted ( Figures 1 and 2 ). Ten of these were found previously in at least two lineages (D614G was mutated early on and maintained throughout). Of those ten, six have the same amino acid substitution in >75% of the sequences, and only one (E484A) has a unique substitution in Omicron (in Beta and Gamma it is a Lys). Figure S1 A shows the number of mutant sequences per residue at positions undergoing mutations in independent lineages. This can be interpreted in two ways: one is that the later mutations are epistatic to one another and thus are more difficult to reach, or that they do not contribute to virus fitness.
The Omicron RBD has 15 changes in total, as described in the next section. The NTD also has numerous changes, including 4 amino acid substitutions, 6 amino acids deleted, and 3 amino acids inserted, also described in the next section. Several mutations found in Omicron occur in residues conserved in SARS-CoV-1 and in many other Sarbecoviruses ( Figure 1 ). These observations agree with the Pango classification ( Rambaut et al., 2020 41. Rambaut, A. ∙ Holmes, E.C. ∙ O'Toole, Á. ... A dynamic nomenclature proposal for SARS-CoV-2 lineages to assist genomic epidemiology Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :1403-1407 Crossref Scopus (1576) PubMed Google Scholar ), which places Omicron at a substantial distance from all other variants.
The Alpha variant has a single change in the RBD at N501Y ( Figure 2 D; Supasa et al., 2021 52. Supasa, P. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant by convalescent and vaccine sera Cell. 2021; 184 :2201-2211.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ), which occupies the right shoulder and contributes to the ACE2 binding footprint. Beta has two further mutations in the RBD: K417N and E484K, at the back of the neck and left shoulder, respectively ( Figure 2 E), which are also part of the ACE2 footprint ( Figure 2 C; Zhou et al., 2021 65. Zhou, D. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Supasa, P. ... Evidence of escape of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 from natural and vaccine-induced sera Cell. 2021; 184 :2348-2361.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gamma mutations are similar: K417T, E484K, and N501Y ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b 15. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Supasa, P. ... Antibody evasion by the P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2021; 184 :2939-2954.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ). Delta mutations: L452R in front of the neck, and T478K on the far side of the left shoulder, fall just peripheral to the ACE2 binding footprint ( Figure 2 F; Liu et al., 2021a 32. Liu, C. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum Cell. 2021; 184 :4220-4236.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ). All of these variants have at least one RBD mutation in common with Omicron. Of the 15 Omicron changes in the RBD, nine map to the ACE2 binding footprint: K417N, G446S, S477N, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, with N440K and T478K just peripheral ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Additionally, mutations occur on the right flank: G339D, S371L, S373P, and S375F ( Figure 2 B), the last three of which are adjacent to a lipid-binding pocket ( Figure S1 B) ( Toelzer et al., 2020 53. Toelzer, C. ∙ Gupta, K. ∙ Yadav, S.K.N. ... Free fatty acid binding pocket in the locked structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Science. 2020; 370 :725-730 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ; Carrique et al., 2020 7. Carrique, L. ∙ Duyvesteyn, H.M.E. ∙ Malinauskas, T. ... The SARS-CoV-2 Spike harbours a lipid binding pocket which modulates stability of the prefusion trimer boiRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). This pocket has been seen occupied by a lipid similar to linoleic acid in an unusually rigid state of S, where all RBDs are found in a locked-down configuration stabilized by lipid-bridged quaternary interactions between adjacent RBDs. However, this lipid-bound form has been seen rarely; instead, the pocket is usually empty and collapsed, with the RBD alternating between looser down and up conformations. We presume that this is because the pocket readily empties of lipid during protein purification. Indeed, rapidly prepared virus particles tend to have RBDs closer to locked-down state ( Ke et al., 2020 26. Ke, Z. ∙ Oton, J. ∙ Qu, K. ... Structures and distributions of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins on intact virions Nature. 2020; 588 :498-502 Crossref Scopus (728) PubMed Google Scholar ). Loss of lipid promotes RBD presentation to the target cell.
Until now, the antigenic properties of variant viruses have been well described by assuming that each mutation produces only a local change in structure, and we used this assumption to rationalize the serological impact of the mutations in Omicron. We present structural data later to qualify this assumption.
The mutations seen in the NTD lie on exposed flexible loops, which differ from those in SARS-CoV-1 and are likely antigenic ( Figure 1 A). The pattern of deletions and insertions seen in Omicron consistently changes those loops that are most different from SARS-CoV-1 to be more SARS-CoV-1-like, at least in length. Of the N1, N3, and N5 loops, which comprise the antibody supersite, Omicron has a substitution at G142D and deletion of residues 143–145 in N3, which would mitigate against binding by a number of potent neutralizing antibodies, e.g., 4A8 and mAb 159 ( Chi et al., 2020 10. Chi, X. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, J. ... A neutralizing human antibody binds to the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :650-655 Crossref Scopus (951) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b 15. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Supasa, P. ... Antibody evasion by the P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2021; 184 :2939-2954.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ). The deletion of residues 69 and 70 in N2 has also occurred in the Alpha variant, whereas the deletion at residue 211, the substitution at 212, and the insertion at 214 are unique to Omicron. All these changes are on the outer surface and are likely antigenic.
We isolated Omicron virus from the throat swab of an infected case in the UK. Following culture in VeroE6 cells transfected with TMPRSS2, the S gene sequence was confirmed to be the Omicron consensus with the additional mutation A701V, which is present in a small number of Omicron sequences.
We have collected convalescent serum/plasma with the indicated median day of sampling, from individuals infected early in the pandemic (n = 32, median day 42) before the emergence of the VOC, along with cases infected with Alpha (n = 18, median day 18), Beta (n = 14, median day 61), Gamma (n = 16, median day 63), and Delta (n = 42, median day 38). Neutralization assays were performed against Omicron and compared with neutralization titers for Victoria (an early pandemic strain), Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.
In all cases, neutralization titers to Omicron were substantially reduced compared with either the ancestral strain Victoria or the homologous strain causing infection, and in a number of cases, the immune serum failed to neutralize Omicron at 1/20 dilution ( Figures 3 A–3E). Compared with Victoria, the neutralization titers of sera for Omicron were reduced for early pandemic 16.9-fold (p < 0.0001), Alpha 33.8-fold (p < 0.0001), Beta 11.8-fold (p = 0.0001), Gamma 3.1-fold (p = 0.001), and Delta 1.7-fold (p = 0.0182). Compared with the neutralization of homologous viruses, for example, Alpha virus by Alpha serum, Omicron neutralization was reduced for sera from Alpha 18.4-fold (p < 0.0001), Beta 22.5-fold (p < 0.0001), Gamma 12.3-fold (p < 0.0001), and Delta 25.9-fold (p < 0.0001).
In summary, Omicron causes widespread escape from neutralization by serum obtained following infection by a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants, meaning that previously infected individuals will have little protection from infection with Omicron, although it is hoped that they will still maintain protection from severe disease.
We have collected sera from Delta-infected cases and because Delta spread in the UK during the vaccination campaign, we obtained sera from three different groups—Delta infection only (n = 19) ( Figure 3 E), Delta infection following vaccination (n = 9), and vaccination following Delta infection (n = 8) ( Figure 3 F). Neutralization assays against early pandemic, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron viruses were performed. Compared with Delta-only infected individuals, sera from cases who had received the vaccine and been infected by Delta showed substantially higher neutralization to all viruses tested—early pandemic, with Delta-infected and vaccinated sera showing a 7.9-fold (p < 0.0001) increase in the neutralization of Omicron compared with Delta infection alone. To confirm the boosting effect of vaccination, we collected a paired blood sample from 6 Delta cases before and after vaccination, which clearly demonstrated the boosting effect of infection and vaccination ( Figure S2 ).
In a number of countries, booster programs have been launched to counter waning immunity and the increasing frequency of breakthrough infections with Delta. To examine the effect of booster vaccination, we tested neutralization of Victoria, Delta, and Omicron viruses using sera from individuals receiving 3 doses of ADZ1222 (n = 41) or BNT162b2 (n = 20). For ADZ1222, the serum was obtained 28 days following the second and third doses ( Figure 3 G). For BNT162b2, the serum was obtained 28 days, 6 months, immediately prior to the third dose, and 28 days following the third dose ( Figure 3 H).
At 28 days following the third dose, for ADZ1222, the neutralization titer to Omicron was reduced 12.7-fold (p < 0.0001) compared with Victoria and 3.6-fold (p < 0.0001) compared with Delta; for BNT162b2, the neutralization titer to Omicron was reduced 14.2-fold (p < 0.0001) compared with Victoria and 3.6-fold (p < 0.0001) compared with Delta. The neutralization titers for Omicron were boosted 2.7-fold (p < 0.0001) and 34.2-fold (p < 0.0001) following the third dose of ADZ1222 and BNT162b2, respectively, compared with 28 days following the second dose. Of concern, and as has been noted previously, neutralization titers fell substantially between 28 days and 6 months following the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, although we did not measure titers at 6 months following the second dose of AZD1222.
In summary, neutralization titers against Omicron are boosted following a third vaccine dose, meaning that the campaign to deploy booster vaccines should add considerable protection against Omicron infection.
We have previously reported a panel of 20 potent neutralizing antibodies (50% focus reduction in neutralization test [FRNT50] < 100 ng/mL) isolated from cases infected with early pandemic viruses (Wuhan) ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 14. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ... The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain Cell. 2021; 184 :2183-2200.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neutralization assays against Omicron were performed and compared with neutralization assays of early pandemic, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta viruses—17/20 mAbs failed to neutralize Omicron (FRNT50 > 10 μg/mL), while the titers for mAbs 58, 222, and 253 were reduced 3.4-, 12.6-, and 19.3-fold, respectively, compared with Victoria ( Figure 4 ; Table S1 ).
The binding sites of these antibodies were mapped together with other published structures to 5 epitopes (based on the position of the center of gravity of each antibody) either by direct structural studies or competition analyses ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 14. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ... The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain Cell. 2021; 184 :2183-2200.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). According to the torso analogy ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 14. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ... The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain Cell. 2021; 184 :2183-2200.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ), these were designated as follows: neck, left shoulder, right shoulder, right flank, and left flank ( Figure 2 B). In Figures 5 A–5D, we show the mapping of the density of centroids to the surface of the RBD with the Omicron mutations shown as spikes (the information is also mapped to the primary structure in Figure 1 A), and selected antibody binding is shown schematically in Figures 5 E–5G. As expected, there is a correlation between the positions of the mutations and the sites of antibody binding, although the antibody centroids are more broadly spread across the RBD surface. In particular, there are no mutations in the left flank epitope, where a significant number of antibodies bind ( Figure 5 A). These antibodies can neutralize in some assays and confer protection ( Barnes et al., 2020 3. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ...

Breadth and function of antibody response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 , e1009352 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ); therefore, this cryptic epitope might be an important target for therapeutic antibody applications and cross-protective vaccine antigen ( Pinto et al., 2020 40. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ). We demonstrate the continued binding of this class of antibodies later on.
Nineteen of the twenty most potent (FRNT50 < 100 ng/mL) neutralizing mAbs are mapped to the ACE2 binding site across the neck and shoulder epitopes of the RBD, and 5 of these are classified as public IGVH3-53 (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene family) antibodies ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 14.

Yuan, M. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Wu, N.C. ... Structural basis of a shared antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mapping these onto the RBD surface ( Figure 5 B) shows that the centroids are highly concentrated in the neck region. IGVH3-53 mAbs were especially common in early pandemic responses, and although their centroid is at the neck, they are orientated in such a way that their light chain CDRs interact with the right shoulder ( Figure S3 ). Most IGVH3-53 mAbs are sensitive to the N501Y mutation, although some, such as mAb 222 or Beta-27, can still neutralize 501Y-containing viruses ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b 15.

Omicron mutation Y505H has a direct interaction with the L1 and L3 CDRs of mAb 222 ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b 15. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Supasa, P. ...

MAbs 253, 55, and 165 are IGVH1-58 mAbs, which bind an epitope toward the left shoulder. H3 contacts S477N, and Q493R is likely disruptive of H2 interactions, leading to the 19.3-fold reduction in neutralization ( Figure S3 ).
The neutralizing activity of mAbs 88, 316, and 384 is knocked out for Omicron ( Figure 4 A; Table S1 ); all interact with E484 (mAb 316 via H1 and H2) within the left shoulder epitope, and the E484A mutation is unfavorable. For mAb 316, Q493R will also likely be deleterious due to contacts with H1 and H3. Broadly neutralizing mAb 58 binds at the front of the RBD, reaching toward the right flank in an area that is relatively clear of mutations and thus is unaffected ( Figure S3 ). MAb 278 binds more of the right shoulder, with L3 in contact with G446, and the G446S mutation in Omicron knocks out activity ( Figure S3 ).
MAb 170 will be affected by Q493R and Q498R, which directly interact with L1 and H3, respectively ( Figure S3 ). Q498R is between G496S and G446S ( Figure 2 B), and G446 is in proximity to H1; together, these mutations knock out the activity of mAb 170 ( Figure 4 A; Table S1 ). The binding sites of selected potent antibodies are shown in Figure 5 E. All of these, with the exception of mAb58, are affected by the mutations in Omicron. To understand the resilience of mAb58, we determined the structure of a ternary complex of an early pandemic RBD with Fabs for mAbs 58 and 158 ( Table S2 ), confirming that its epitope includes no residues mutated in Omicron ( Figure S3 ).
We derived a panel of 27 potent Beta antibodies (FRNT < 100 ng/mL) ( Liu et al., 2021b 33. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this revealed a surprisingly skewed response with 18/27 potent antibodies targeting the Beta mutations: E484K, K417N, and N501Y. This is seen in Figure 5 C, where the focus on residues in the shoulders has spread the centroid patch out toward several Omicron mutation sites. This information is mapped to the primary structure in Figure 1 A, and a schematic of the binding of the four potent cross-reactive antibodies is shown in Figure 5 F. While K417N and N501Y are conserved in Omicron, E484 is mutated to an alanine, which seems a likely escape mutation from either 484E (early pandemic/Alpha) or 484K (Beta).
Neutralization assays were performed against Omicron and they showed a complete loss of activity for 17/27 Beta mAbs ( Figure 4 B; Table S1 ). Substantial reductions in neutralization titers were observed for many of the rest of the Beta panel, with Beta-22, -29, -40, -47, -53, -54, -55, and -56 being able to neutralize Omicron with titers <400 ng/mL.
A large number of Beta mAbs target the 501Y mutation, including a public antibody response mediated through IGVH4-39 (n = 6) and the related IGVH4-30 (n = 1) ( Liu et al., 2021b 33. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many are likely to be sensitive to the numerous mutations in this region: N440K, G446S, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, and Y505H. In total, 11 antibodies contact 501Y; Beta -6 , - 10 , - 23 , - 24 , - 30 , -40, -54, -55, and -56, while Beta-22 and -29 bind epitopes dependent on 417N/T together with 501Y (antibodies in italic are VH4-39 or VH4-30 and the neutralization of Omicron for those in bold is completely knocked out). Beta mAbs targeting the back of the neck epitope (Beta-22, -29, and -30) will be affected, for example, in the case of Beta-29, H1 makes extensive interactions with residues Q493, G496, and Y505 ( Figure S4 ). Beta-44 binding to the left shoulder epitope has already been shown to be sensitive to T478K, while the combination of S477N and T478K in Omicron is likely to be more deleterious. Interestingly, several of the antibodies (Beta-40 , -54, -55, -56, and Beta-22 and -29 [501Y 417N/T]) retain some activity, and this is explained later on with reference also to the structure of the Omicron RBD/Fab 55 complex.
Four Beta mAbs potently cross-neutralize all Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants ( Liu et al., 2021b 33. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar , Figure 5 F). Of these, Beta-27 is a VH3-53 antibody that contacts Q493 and Y505 in a similar way to mAb222 and shows reduced neutralization of Omicron ( Figure 4 B; Table S1 ). Beta-47, a VH1-58 antibody, has contacts with S477 and Q493, likely leading to the observed reduction in neutralization of Omicron.
Beta-49 and -50, which belong to the IGVH1-69 gene family, bind similarly to the right flank and are knocked out by Omicron ( Figure 4 B; Table S1 ). They lie directly on RBD G339 and would clash with G339D. Beta-53 also binds to the right flank, with H1 contacting residue 339 and likely clashing with G339D. L1 likely contacts G446S, leading to the observed two-log reduction in Omicron neutralization compared with Beta ( Figure S4 ).
Various individual antibodies or cocktails of antibodies (usually recognizing different epitopes to reduce the risk of escape [ Sun et al., 2021 51. Sun, Y. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Feng, R. ... Structure-based development of three- and four-antibody cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms Cell Res. 2021; 31 :597-600 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ]) have been licensed for use, and the aggregate of their binding is shown in Figure 5 G. This illustrates the strong correlation of binding with sites of mutation (this is mapped to the primary structure in Figure 1 A) and neutralization of Omicron is markedly reduced in most ( Figure 4 C; Table S1 ). Specifically, they are as follows:
Regeneron 10933 and 10987 : Regeneron 10933 ( Weinreich et al., 2021 57. Weinreich, D.M. ∙ Sivapalasingam, S. ∙ Norton, T. ... REGN-COV2, a neutralizing antibody cocktail, in outpatients with Covid-19 N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384 :238-251 Crossref Scopus (1196) PubMed Google Scholar ) binds to the back of the left shoulder and 10987 to the right shoulder ( Figures 5 G and S5 ); activity of both is knocked out on Omicron ( Figure 4 C). REGN10933 is unable to effectively neutralize Beta, being sensitive to E484K ( Zhou et al., 2021 65. Zhou, D. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Supasa, P. ... Evidence of escape of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 from natural and vaccine-induced sera Cell. 2021; 184 :2348-2361.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar ), and H2 contacts Q493, so that neutralization of Omicron is almost completely lost. REGN10987 contacts N440 and G446 causing complete loss of neutralization ( Figure S5 ).

Emerging antibody-based therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 during the global pandemic Antib Ther. 2020; 3 :246-256 PubMed Google Scholar ) binds to the right flank, contacting G339 and N343 (glycan close to SLS371L, S373P, and S375F) ( Figures 5 G and S5 ). S309 neutralization of Omicron is only reduced 6.4-fold compared with Victoria, and binding, measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, is little affected ( Figure S6 A).
AZD8895 and AZD1061 : AZD8895, a VH1-58 antibody, binds to the back of the left shoulder and activity on Omicron is reduced 230-fold compared with Victoria due to contacts with S477 (H3) and Q493 (H2). AZD1061, binding the front of the right shoulder is reduced 268-fold ( Figures 5 G and S5 ) due to L2 and H3 contacts with the G446 loop. AZD7442 (a combination of AZD8895 and AZD1061) maintains neutralizing activity against Omicron, although reduced 30.3-fold compared with Victoria.
LY-CoV016 and 555 : The activity of both antibodies on Omicron is knocked out. LY-CoV016 is a VH3-53 antibody and extensive interactions with N501 and Y505 via L1 and L3 make it vulnerable to mutations at these residues ( Figures 5 G and S5 ). LY-CoV555 ( Sun and Ho, 2020 50. Sun, Y. ∙ Ho, M. Emerging antibody-based therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 during the global pandemic Antib Ther. 2020; 3 :246-256 PubMed Google Scholar ) is sensitive to the E484K mutation in Delta ( Liu et al., 2021a 32. Liu, C. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum Cell. 2021; 184 :4220-4236.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ) and also contacts Q493.
ADG 10, 20, 30 : All Adagio antibodies suffer considerable loss of activity against Omicron ( Figure 4 C). The activity of ADG10 and ADG30 were completely lost, while ADG20 activity was reduced 276-fold.
Fitness of a virus can stem from higher infectivity or evasion of the immune system. One way to identify mutations that increase binding affinity is by selection, using a randomly mutated RBD displayed on the yeast surface for ACE2 binding to obtain the highest affinity clone RBD-62. Mutations fixed for higher affinity binding included N501Y, E484K, S477N, and most prominently, Q498R ( Figure 6 A; Zahradník et al., 2021b 63. Zahradník, J. ∙ Marciano, S. ∙ Shemesh, M. ... SARS-CoV-2 variant prediction and antiviral drug design are enabled by RBD in vitro evolution Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1188-1198 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, Q498R was selected only at later stages. This is explained by the 2-fold reduction in affinity as a single mutation ( Figure 6 A). However, in combination with the N501Y mutation, the affinity is increased 26-fold, more than any other mutation analyzed. Adding to this, the S477N mutation, one obtains a 37-fold increase in binding ( Figure 6 B). These three mutations, selected through in vitro evolution, were found together for the first time in the Omicron variant.
We measured the affinity of Omicron RBD for ACE2 using SPR and yeast display titration. Perhaps surprisingly, the affinity was on par with that of the early virus, 8 and 7 nM, respectively, using SPR ( Figures 6 B and S6 A) and 2.9 and 1.9 nM using yeast display titration (SPR and yeast display titration data strongly correlate but with a constant shift in absolute values [ Zahradník et al., 2021b 63. Zahradník, J. ∙ Marciano, S. ∙ Shemesh, M. ... SARS-CoV-2 variant prediction and antiviral drug design are enabled by RBD in vitro evolution Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1188-1198 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ]). This implies that the increased affinity imparted by S477N, Q498R, and N501Y is being offset by other mutations in the ACE2 footprint. We measured the affinities of the other single mutations in the ACE2 binding footprint of Omicron (using yeast display titration), as shown in Figures 6 B and 6C, and they provide a rationale for this. T478K in the presence of N501Y decreased the positive effect of the latter by 2-fold. Y505H reduces the binding of Q498R, N501Y double mutant by 50%. G496S and the triple-mutation S371L, S373P, and S375F reduce binding by 2- and 2.2-fold, respectively. The effect of changing the triple-mutant (S371L, S373P, and S375F) back to the wild-type sequence was even more pronounced in the background of Omicron, in which the affinity increased from 2.9 to 0.4 nM (7-fold). Moreover, this back-to-wild-type triple-mutant increased the expression on the surface of yeast 10-fold relative to Omicron. This indicates a functional role in increasing the fitness of the virus for this triple-mutant, which requires the binding enhancement provided by the Q498R, N501Y double mutant. E484A (instead of the Lys found in other variants, Figure 6 A) was neutral. While K417N (found in the Beta variant) on its own decreases binding substantially, the effect on binding when combined with other mutations is smaller ( Figure 6 B). Two single mutations found specifically in Omicron, Q493R, and N440K did increase binding, probably due to increasing the electrostatic complementarity between ACE2 (negatively charged) and the RBD (positively charged) ( Figure 6 D).
Comparing the structure of the complex of the pM affinity RBD-62 with ACE2 ( Zahradnik et al., 2021b 63. Zahradník, J. ∙ Marciano, S. ∙ Shemesh, M. ... SARS-CoV-2 variant prediction and antiviral drug design are enabled by RBD in vitro evolution Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1188-1198 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ; PDB: 7BH9 ) to that of Omicron, RBD bound to Beta-55 antibody (described later on, see Table S2 ; Figure 6 C) shows high similarity with an RMSD of 0.55 Å over 139 residues. Importantly, the locations of the binding-enhancing mutations 477N, 498R, and 501Y are conserved between the two, despite the RBD-62 being bound to ACE2, while Omicron RBD is not. This shows that these residues are pre-arranged for tight binding, implying low entropic penalty of binding.
We used the matrix of neutralization data generated in Figure 3 to place Omicron on an antigenic map, with a method similar to that developed for analysis of the Delta variant ( Liu et al., 2021a 32. Liu, C. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum Cell. 2021; 184 :4220-4236.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ), where we model individual viruses independently and allow for serum-specific scaling of the responses ( STAR Methods ). This model works well; the measured and modeled responses are shown in Figures 7 A and 7B (with 1,600 observations and 215 parameters, the residual error is 9.1%). The results are well described in three dimensions (see Video S1 ) and are shown projected into two dimensions in Figures 7 C and 7D. It will be seen that the previous variants are placed in a planetary band around a central point, with Delta opposed to Beta and Gamma; however, Omicron is displaced a large distance out of this plane, almost on a line drawn from the central point perpendicular to the planetary band, illustrating vividly how Omicron dramatically expands our view of the antigenic landscape of SARS-CoV-2.

Antigenic map for major variants of SARS-CoV-2, related to Figure 7
We first used Alphafold2 ( Jumper et al., 2021 24. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (14556) PubMed Google Scholar ) to predict the Omicron RBD structure ( Figure S1 B). The top-ranked structure was very similar to the early pandemic RBD (RMSD for Cαs 0.71 Å, residues 334–528), with a significant difference in the region of the triple serine mutations 371–375, on the right flank ( Figure S1 B). We then determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the Omicron RBD domain in complex with two Fabs: Beta-55 and EY6A ( Figure S6 B and Table S2 ) ( Huang et al., 2021 22. Huang, K.A. ∙ Tan, T.K. ∙ Chen, T.H. ... Breadth and function of antibody response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 , e1009352 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2021b 33. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 66. Zhou, D. ∙ Duyvesteyn, H.M.E. ∙ Chen, C.P. ... Structural basis for the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an antibody from a convalescent patient Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :950-958 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RBD structure is indeed close to that of early pandemic viruses (RMSD 0.9 Å for 187 Cα) with the only significant change at the 371/373/375 triple serine mutations ( Figure 7 E). The rearrangement in this region is essentially an amplified version of that predicted by Alphafold2, suggesting that such algorithms have some value in predicting the effect of dense mutations as seen in Omicron RBD. The mutations S371L, S373P, and S375F are all changes from small, flexible polar serine residues to bulkier, less flexible hydrophobic residues. Interestingly, all the Omicron S mutations involve single codon changes apart from S371L, which requires two changes from TCC to CTC, indicative of underlying strong selection pressure and functional change. Although the rearrangement in Omicron is quite modest, it is exactly this region of the structure that undergoes a larger conformation change when lipid is bound into the pocket ( Figure S1 B). Changes in the serine-rich loop allow the attached helix to swing out, opening the pocket for lipid binding. It is possible that the increased rigidity and the entropic penalty of exposing hydrophobic residues may disfavor lipid binding to Omicron, which would alter the properties of the virus, explaining the selection of these changes.
The binding of EY6A to the left flank of the RBD is essentially unchanged from that observed previously ( Zhou et al., 2020 66. Zhou, D. ∙ Duyvesteyn, H.M.E. ∙ Chen, C.P. ... Structural basis for the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an antibody from a convalescent patient Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :950-958 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ) (dissociation constant [K D ] 7.8 and 6.8 nM for early pandemic and Omicron RBDs, respectively, by SPR) ( Figures 7 F and S6 A). This cryptic epitope, which is highly conserved for functional reasons, is a good target for broadly neutralizing therapeutic antibodies.
Beta-55, as predicted earlier ( Liu et al., 2021b 33. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), binds to the right shoulder, around residue 501. Interestingly, the epitope includes several residues mutated in Omicron from the early pandemic virus (including Q498R, N501Y, and Y505H) ( Figures 7 E, S6 B, and S6C). It is remarkable that despite these significant changes, neutralization is relatively little affected. The neutralization result was confirmed by measurements of the binding affinity, 177 pM and 204 pM for the early pandemic and Omicron RBDs, respectively ( Figure S6 A). To confirm the structural basis, we also determined the crystal structure of an analogous ternary complex formed with early pandemic RBD ( Table S2 ). As expected, the details of the interaction are essentially identical. If we extend the analysis of the 501Y targeting antibodies by comparing the structures of Beta-6, -24, -40, and -54, we find subtle explanations; thus, Beta-24 and some others are knocked out due to a clash with CDR-L1 created by the Q493R mutation ( Figure S6 D), whereas for antibodies Beta-40, -54, and -55, this mutation can be accommodated. In addition, the Q498R mutation may create a hydrogen bond in Beta-40 or a salt bridge in Beta-54 to CDR-H3, which may compensate for the loss of binding affinity due to changes around residue 501 ( Figure S6 E). Thus, the surprising resilience of several of the 501Y targeting antibodies may be because the mutated residues in this region are not “hotspots” of interaction, and mutations can sometimes be accommodated without significant impact on affinity. This may suggest that a major driver for evolution was the less 501-focused responses to early viruses.

Section: Discussion

The first 4 Omicron sequences were deposited on 24 th November 2021. Within days, distant international spread was seen, and has caused great concern due to its high transmissibility and ability to infect previously exposed or vaccinated individuals. Only 3 weeks after the virus was first detected in the UK, Omicron cases outnumbered Delta in London, with the number of daily new cases in the UK larger than that recorded during any other previous time in the pandemic. Over the next weeks, disease severity will become clearer.
The density of mutational changes (including deletions and insertions) found in Omicron S is extraordinary, being more than three times that observed in previous variants. Within S, as observed for other variants, the NTD, RBD, and the furin cleavage site region are hotspots for mutation ( Zahradník et al., 2021b 63. Zahradník, J. ∙ Marciano, S. ∙ Shemesh, M. ... SARS-CoV-2 variant prediction and antiviral drug design are enabled by RBD in vitro evolution Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1188-1198 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ), and within the RBD, mutations are concentrated on the ACE2 interacting surface and the right flank.
Most potent neutralizing antibodies bind on or in proximity to the ACE2 footprint (neck and shoulder epitopes) and block interaction of S with ACE2, thereby preventing viral attachment to the host cell. There are two other classes of potent neutralizing mAbs, first antibodies binding in close proximity to the N343 glycan (right flank epitope) exemplified by Vir S309 ( Pinto et al., 2020 40. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ), which includes the Beta-49, -50, and -53 antibodies ( Liu et al., 2021b 33. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) used in our analysis. These mAbs bind distant from the ACE2 binding site, do not block ACE2 interaction, and destabilize the S-trimer, which may be their mechanism of action. Finally, antibodies binding to the supersite on the NTD can also be potently neutralizing, although the mechanism of action of NTD antibodies remains obscure ( Cerutti et al., 2021 9. Cerutti, G. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Zhou, T. ...

The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain Cell. 2021; 184 :2183-2200.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple mutations at all three of these sites—the receptor-binding site, proximal to N343 glycan, and NTD—are found in Omicron and lead to substantial reduction in neutralization titers for naturally immune or vaccine sera, with many showing complete failure of neutralization. This, together with the widespread failure of potent mAb to neutralize Omicron, points to a driver of immune evasion for their evolution.
The left flank epitope, which is not mutated in Omicron, is used by antibodies that do not block ACE2 binding but are protective ( Barnes et al., 2020 3. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ...

Following repeated rounds of selection by yeast display for high ACE2 affinity, RBD-62 (I358F, V445K, N460K, I468T, T470M, S477N, E484K, Q498R, and N501Y) emerged as the highest affinity clone with a 1,000-fold increase in affinity for ACE2 from 17 nM for Wuhan RBD to 16 pM for RBD-62. It is striking that the key contributors for the high affinity of RBD-62 are present in Omicron. Interestingly, the combination of mutations K417M, E484K, Q493R, Q498R, and N501Y also emerged after 30 passages in mouse lungs ( Roy Wong et al., 2021 44. Roy Wong, L.Y. ∙ Zheng, J. ∙ Wilhelmsen, K. ... Eicosanoid signaling as a therapeutic target in middle-aged mice with severe COVID-19 bioRxiv. 2021; bioRxiv Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This mouse-adapted virus was highly virulent and caused more severe disease. The appearance of E484K, Q493H/R, Q498R, and N501Y in yeast display and mouse adaptation experiments are strong indications that the tighter binding to ACE2 also facilitates more efficient transmission.
However, in Omicron, overall affinity for ACE2 is not increased, suggesting a different strategy. Since mutations S477N, Q498R, and N501Y are likely to increase ACE2 affinity by 37-fold, we hypothesize that these changes, also found in RBD-62, serve to anchor the RBD to ACE2, leaving the rest of the receptor-binding motif more freedom to develop further mutations, including those that reduce ACE2 affinity, in a quest to evade the neutralizing antibody response. Indeed, K417N, T478K, G496S, Y505H, and the triple S371L, S373P, S375F reduce affinity to ACE2 while driving immune evasion. All this is achieved with very minimal structural changes in the isolated Omicron RBD ( Figure 7 E).
These observations provide a valuable lesson on the plasticity of protein-protein binding sites, maintaining nM binding affinity ( Cohen-Khait and Schreiber, 2016 12. Cohen-Khait, R. ∙ Schreiber, G. Low-stringency selection of TEM1 for BLIP shows interface plasticity and selection for faster binders Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :14982-14987 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the extreme concentration of potent neutralizing antibodies around the 25 amino acid receptor footprint of ACE2 suggests that this would be an Achilles heel for SARS-CoV-2, with ACE2 placing constraints on its variability (this is why receptor-binding sites are often hidden [ Rossmann et al., 1985 43. Rossmann, M.G. ∙ Arnold, E. ∙ Erickson, J.W. ... Structure of a human common cold virus and functional relationship to other picornaviruses Nature. 1985; 317 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (1091) PubMed Google Scholar ]). However, in practice, the extraordinary plasticity of this site, allowing it to absorb mutational change while retaining affinity for ACE2, is a potent weapon to evade the antibody response. Such camouflage of receptor-binding sites has been observed before (see, for example, Acharya et al., 1989 1. Acharya, R. ∙ Fry, E. ∙ Stuart, D. ... The three-dimensional structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus at 2.9 A resolution Nature. 1989; 337 :709-716 Crossref Scopus (719) PubMed Google Scholar ), but it seems that by acquiring a lock on the ACE2 receptor at one point, through 498 and associated mutations, many other less energetically favorable changes can be tolerated, fueling antigenic escape. Thus, by mutating the receptor-binding site, the virus can modulate ACE2 affinity and potentially transmissibility while evading the antibody response.
How Omicron evolved is under debate. The results presented here suggest that immune evasion is a primary driver in its evolution, sacrificing affinity-enhancing mutations to optimize immune-evading mutations. This could, for instance, occur in a single immunocompromised individual, with further evolution in rural, unmonitored populations ( Clark et al., 2021 11. Clark, S.A. ∙ Clark, L.E. ∙ Pan, J. ... SARS-CoV-2 evolution in an immunocompromised host reveals shared neutralization escape mechanisms Cell. 2021; 184 :2605-2617.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Virus evolution has been previously observed in chronically infected HIV+ individuals and other immunocompromised cases, leading to the expression of the N501Y, E484K, and K417T mutations ( Cele et al., 2021 8. Cele, S. ∙ Karim, F. ∙ Lustig, G. ... SARS-CoV-2 evolved during advanced HIV disease immunosuppression has Beta-like escape of vaccine and Delta infection elicited immunity medRxiv, medRxiv. 2021; 2021.09.14.21263564 Google Scholar ; Karim et al., 2021 25. Karim, F. ∙ Moosa, M.Y.S. ∙ Gosnell, B.I. ... Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and intra-host evolution in association with advanced HIV infection medRxiv. 2021; medRxiv:2021.06.03.21258228 Google Scholar ; Kemp et al., 2021 27. Kemp, S.A. ∙ Collier, D.A. ∙ Datir, R.P. ... SARS-CoV-2 evolution during treatment of chronic infection Nature. 2021; 592 :277-282 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ). What seems beyond doubt from the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (only one synonymous mutation in all of S) is that the evolution has been driven by strong selective pressure on S. It has been predicted that increasing immunity by natural infection or vaccination will increase the selective pressure to find a susceptible host, either by increased transmissibility or antibody evasion. It appears that Omicron has achieved both of these goals, although our data only speak directly to antibody evasion.
In addition to changes in the ACE2 footprint, Omicron RBD possesses a triplet of mutations from serines to more bulky, hydrophobic residues, a motif not found in any other Sarbecoviruses. This introduces structural changes and may lead to loss of the ability to form the lipid-binding pocket, which might normally aid release of the virus from infected cells. One of these mutations requires a double change in the codon, reinforcing its significance, and it is conceivable that there is synergy with the change at residue 498, perhaps explaining why this mutation has not established itself earlier.
For most mAbs, the changes in interaction are so severe that the activity is completely lost or greatly impaired. This also extends to the set of mAbs developed for clinical use—the activity of most is lost, AZD8895 and ADG20 activity is substantially reduced, whereas the activity of Vir S309 is more modestly reduced.
Omicron has now got a foothold in many countries. In the UK, it has an estimated doubling time of 2.5 days and 2 doses of vaccine appear to give low protection from infection, whereas 3 doses give better protection. There is considerable concern that Omicron will rapidly replace Delta and cause a large and sharp peak of infection in early 2022. It is likely that substantial increases in transmissibility and immune evasion are contributing to the explosive rise in Omicron infections. At present, the only option to control the spread of Omicron, barring social distancing and mask wearing, is to pursue vaccination with Wuhan-containing antigen to boost the response to sufficiently high titers to provide some protection. However, the antigenic distance of Omicron may mandate the development of vaccines against this strain. There will then be a question of how to use these vaccines; vaccination with Omicron will likely give good protection against Omicron but will not give good protection against other strains. Therefore, it seems possible that Omicron may cause a shift from the current monovalent vaccines containing Wuhan S to multivalent vaccines containing an antigen, such as Wuhan or Alpha, at the center of the antigenic map and Omicron or other S genes at the extreme peripheries of the map, similar to the polyvalent strategies used in influenza vaccines.
In summary, we have presented data showing that the huge number of mutational changes present in Omicron lead to a substantial knockdown of neutralizing capacity of immune serum and failure of mAb. This appears to lead to a fall in vaccine effectiveness, but it is unlikely that vaccines will completely fail and it is hoped that although vaccine breakthroughs will occur, protection from severe disease will be maintained, perhaps by T cells. It is likely that the vaccine-induced T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 will be less affected than the antibody response. Third-dose vaccine boosters substantially raise neutralization titers to Omicron and are the mainstay of the response to Omicron in countries, such as the UK. Widespread vaccine breakthroughs may mandate the production of a vaccine tailored to Omicron, and failure of mAbs may likewise lead to the generation of second-generation mAbs targeting Omicron.
A question asked after the appearance of each new variant is whether SARS-CoV-2 has reached its limit for evolution. Analyzing the mutations in Omicron shows that, except for S371L, all other mutations require only single-nucleotide changes. Two-nucleotide mutations and epistatic mutations are more difficult to reach, but they open up vast untapped potential for future variants. Global control measures are critical to avoid this.
The neutralization assays presented in this paper are performed in vitro and do not fully quantify the antibody response in vivo , where complement and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity may contribute to virus control. Evasion of the antibody response may allow reinfection with Omicron, but the role of the T cell response, which is not measured here, is likely to contribute to the control of infection and disease severity.

SARS-CoV-2/, S371L SARS-CoV-2/human/AUS/VIC01/2020 (Caly et al., 2020), Alpha and Beta were provided by Public Health England, Gamma cultured from a throat swab from Brazil, Delta was a gift from Wendy Barclay and Thushan de Silva, from the UK G2P genotype to phenotype consortium and Omicron was grown from a positive throat swab (IRAS Project ID: 269573, Ethics Ref: 19/NW/0730. Briefly, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (NIBSC) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high glucose supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 2mM Glutamax, 100 IU/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 2.5ug/ml amphotericin B, at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 before inoculation with 200ul of swab fluid. Cells were further maintained at 37°C with daily observations for cytopathic effect (CPE). Virus-containing supernatants were clarified at 80% CPE by centrifugation at 3,000 r.p.m. at 4 °C before being stored at -80 °C in single-use aliquots. Viral titres were determined by a focus-forming assay on Vero CCL-81 cells (ATCC). Sequencing of the Omicron isolate shows the expected consensus S gene changes (A67V, Δ69-70, T95I, G142D/Δ143-145, Δ211/L212I, ins214EPE, G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, T547K, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H, N764K, D796Y, N856K, Q954H, N969K, L981F), an intact furin cleavage site and a single additional mutation A701V. Cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus using an MOI of 0.0001.
Virus-containing supernatants were harvested at 80% CPE and spun at 3000 rpm at 4 °C before storage at -80 °C. Viral titres were determined by a focus-forming assay on Vero cells. Victoria passage 5, Alpha passage 2 and Beta passage 4 stocks Gamma passage 1, Delta passage 3 and Omicron passage 1 were sequenced to verify that they contained the expected spike protein sequence and no changes to the furin cleavage sites.
Vero, Vero (ATCC CCL-81) and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco, 35050061) and 100 U/ml of penicillin–streptomycin. Human mAbs were expressed in HEK293T cells cultured in UltraDOMA PF Protein-free Medium (Cat#12-727F, LONZA) at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . HEK293T (ATCCCRL -11268) cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 1 % 100X Mem Neaa (Gibco) and 1 %100X L-Glutamine (Gibco) at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . To express RBD, RBD variants and ACE2, HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose (Sigma) supplemented with 2 % FBS, 1 % 100X Mem Neaa and 1 % 100X L-Glutamine at 37 °C for transfection. Omicron RBD and human mAbs were also expressed in HEK293T (ATCCCRL-11268) cells cultured in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (ThermoFisher,12338018) at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . E .coli DH5α bacteria were used for transformation and large-scalepreparation of plasmids. A single colony was picked and cultured in LB broth at 37 °C at 200 rpm in a shaker overnight.
Participants from the first wave of SARS-CoV2 in the U.K. and those sequence confirmed with B.1.1.7 lineage in December 2020 and February 2021 were recruited through three studies: Sepsis Immunomics [Oxford REC C, reference:19/SC/0296]), ISARIC/WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections [Oxford REC C, reference 13/SC/0149] and the Gastro-intestinal illness in Oxford: COVID sub study [Sheffield REC, reference: 16/YH/0247]. Diagnosis was confirmed through reporting of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and a test positive for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from an upper respiratory tract (nose/throat) swab tested in accredited laboratories. A blood sample was taken following consent at least 14 days after symptom onset. Clinical information including severity of disease (mild, severe or critical infection according to recommendations from the World Health Organisation) and times between symptom onset and sampling and age of participant was captured for all individuals at the time of sampling. Following heat inactivation of plasma/serum samples they were aliquoted so that no more than 3 freeze thaw cycles were performed for data generation.
Beta and Delta samples from UK infected cases were collected under the “Innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare worker family and household members” protocol affiliated to the Gastro-intestinal illness in Oxford: COVID sub study discussed above and approved by the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee. All individuals had sequence confirmed Beta/Delta infection or PCR-confirmed symptomatic disease occurring whilst in isolation and in direct contact with Beta/Delta sequence-confirmed cases. Additional Beta infected serum (sequence confirmed) was obtained from South Africa. At the time of swab collection patients signed an informed consent to consent for the collection of data and serial blood samples. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand (reference number 200313) and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Gamma samples were provided by the International Reference Laboratory for Coronavirus at FIOCRUZ (WHO) as part of the national surveillance for coronavirus and had the approval of the FIOCRUZ ethical committee (CEP 4.128.241) to continuously receive and analyse samples of COVID-19 suspected cases for virological surveillance. Clinical samples were shared with Oxford University, UK under the MTA IOC FIOCRUZ 21-02.
Pfizer vaccine serum was obtained from volunteers who had received two and three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Vaccinees were Health Care Workers, based at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, not known to have prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 and were enrolled in the OPTIC Study as part of the Oxford Translational Gastrointestinal Unit GI Biobank Study 16/YH/0247 [research ethics committee (REC) at Yorkshire & The Humber – Sheffield] which has been amended for this purpose on 8 June 2020. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants enrolled in the study. Participants were sampled approximately 28 days (range 25-38), 180 days (range 178-221) and 270 days (range 243-273) after receiving two doses of Pfizer/BioNtech BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine, 30 micrograms, administered intramuscularly after dilution (0.3 mL each), 17-28 days apart, then approximately 28 days (range 25-56) after receiving a third "booster" dose of BNT162B2 vaccine. The mean age of vaccinees was 42 years (range 30-59), 10 male and 10 female.
Full details of the randomized controlled trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), were previously published (PMID: 33220855/PMID: 32702298). These studies were registered at ISRCTN (15281137 and 89951424) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04324606 and NCT04400838). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the trial is being done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The studies were sponsored by the University of Oxford (Oxford, UK) and approval obtained from a national ethics committee (South Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee, reference 20/SC/0145 and 20/SC/0179) and a regulatory agency in the United Kingdom (the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency). An independent DSMB reviewed all interim safety reports. A copy of the protocols was included in previous publications ( Folegatti et al., 2020 19. Folegatti, P.M. ∙ Ewer, K.J. ∙ Aley, P.K. ... Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial Lancet. 2020; 396 :467-478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1772) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Data from vaccinated volunteers who received three vaccinations are included in this paper. Vaccine doses were either 5 × 10 10 viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort n=21) or half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort n=4). The interval between first and second dose was in the range of 8-14 weeks. Blood samples were collected and serum separated on the day of vaccination and on pre-specified days after vaccination e.g. 14 and 28 days after boost.
The neutralization potential of Ab was measured using a Focus Reduction Neutralization Test (FRNT), where the reduction in the number of the infected foci is compared to a negative control well without antibody. Briefly, serially diluted Ab or plasma was mixed with SARS-CoV-2 strains for 1 hr at 37 °C. The mixtures were then transferred to 96 - well , cell culture-treated, flat-bottom microplates containing confluent Vero cell monolayers in duplicate and incubated for a further 2 hrs followed by the addition of 1.5% semi-solid carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) overlay medium to each well to limit virus diffusion. A focus forming assay was then performed by staining Vero cells with human anti-NP mAb (mAb206) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (A0170; Sigma). Finally, the foci (infected cells) approximately 100 per well in the absence of antibodies, were visualized by adding TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate. Virus-infected cell foci were counted on the classic AID EliSpot reader using AID ELISpot software. The percentage of focus reduction was calculated and IC 50 was determined using the probit program from the SPSS package.
Cloning was done by using a restriction-free approach ( Peleg and Unger, 2014 38. Peleg, Y. ∙ Unger, T. Application of the Restriction-Free (RF) cloning for multicomponents assembly Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1116 :73-87 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutagenic megaprimers were PCR amplified (KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, Roche, Switzerland, cat. KK3605), purified by using NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Nacherey-Nagel, Germany, REF 740609.50) and cloned into pJYDC1 (Adgene ID: 162458) ( Zahradnik et al., 2021a 62. Zahradník, J. ∙ Dey, D. ∙ Marciano, S. ... A protein-engineered, enhanced yeast display platform for rapid evolution of challenging targets ACS Synth. Biol. 2021; 10 :3445-3460 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Parental pJYDC1 molecules were cleaved by DpnI treatment (1 h, NEB, USA, cat. R0176) and the reaction mixture was electroporated into E.coli Cloni® 10G cells (Lucigen, USA). The correctness of mutagenesis was verified by sequencing.
Plasmids (pJYDC1) with mutations were transformed (1 ug of DNA) by LiAc method ( Gietz and Woods, 2006 20. Gietz, R.D. ∙ Woods, R.A. Yeast Transformation by the LiAc/SS Carrier DNA/PEG Method Methods in Molecular Biology. 2006; 313 :107-120 PubMed Google Scholar ) into the EBY100 Saccharomyces cerevisiae and selected by growth on SD-W plates ( Zahradnik et al., 2021a 62. Zahradník, J. ∙ Dey, D. ∙ Marciano, S. ... A protein-engineered, enhanced yeast display platform for rapid evolution of challenging targets ACS Synth. Biol. 2021; 10 :3445-3460 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 48-72 h at 30°C. Grown single colonies were transferred to 1.0 ml liquid SD-CAA media, grown 24 h or 48 (RBD-Omicron) at 30°C (220 rpm), and 50 ul of the starter culture was used as inoculum (5 %) for the expression culture in 1/9 media (1 ml) supplemented with 1 nM DMSO solubilized bilirubin (Merck/Sigma-Aldrich cat. B4126). The expression continued in a shaking incubator for 24 h at 20°C (220 rpm). Aliquots of yeast expressed cells (100 ul, 3000 g, 3 min) were washed in ice-cold PBSB buffer (PBS with 1 g/L BSA) and resuspended in PBSB with a dilution series CF640-ACE2 (1 pM – 80 nM). The volume and incubation times were adjusted to limit the ligand depletion effect and enable equilibrium ( Zahradnik et al., 2021b 63. Zahradník, J. ∙ Marciano, S. ∙ Shemesh, M. ... SARS-CoV-2 variant prediction and antiviral drug design are enabled by RBD in vitro evolution Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1188-1198 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). After incubation, cells were washed in ice-cold PBSB buffer (PBS with 1 g/L BSA) passed through cell strainer nylon membrane (40 μM, SPL Life Sciences, Korea), and analyzed. The yeast expressing Omicron-RBD were expression labelled by primary anti-c-Myc 9E10 antibody (Biolegend, Cat. 626872) and secondary Anti-Mouse IgG(Fc specific)-FITC (Merck/Sigma-Aldrich, cat. F4143) antibodies. The signals for expression (FL1, eUnaG2 fluorophore, Ex. 498 nm, Em. 527 nm or FITC) and for binding (FL3, CF®640R dye-labeled ACE2) were recorded by S3e Cell Sorter (BioRad, USA). The standard non-cooperative Hill equation was fitted by nonlinear least-squares regression with two additional parameters using Python 3.7 ( Starr et al., 2020 47. Starr, T.N. ∙ Greaney, A.J. ∙ Hilton, S.K. ...

Biol. 2021; 10 :3445-3460 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Antigenic mapping of Omicron was carried out through an extension of a previous algorithm ( Liu et al., 2021a 32. Liu, C. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum Cell. 2021; 184 :4220-4236.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, coronavirus variants were assigned three-dimensional coordinates whereby the distance between two points indicates the base drop in neutralization titre. Each serum was assigned a strength parameter which provided a scalar offset to the logarithm of the neutralization titre. These parameters were refined to match predicted neutralization titres to observed values by taking an average of superimposed positions from 30 separate runs. The three-dimensional positions of the variants of concern: Victoria, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron were plotted for display.
Models of Omicron RBD and NTD were derived using AlphaFold 2.0.01 ( Jumper et al., 2021 24. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (14556) PubMed Google Scholar ) downloaded and installed on 11 th August 2021 in batch mode. For RBD predictions, 204 residues (P327-N529) were used as an input sequence while the NTD sequence input was from residues V1-S253. The max_release_date parameter was set to 28-11-2021 when the simulations were run such that template information was used for structure modelling. For all targets, five models were generated and all presets were kept the same.
Expression plasmids of wild-type and Omicron spike and RBD were constructed encoding for human codon-optimized sequences from wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947) and Omicron (EPI_ISL_6640917). Wild-type Spike and RBD plasmids were constructed as described before ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 14. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ... The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain Cell. 2021; 184 :2183-2200.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spike and RBD fragments of Omicron were custom synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific GENEART) and cloned into pHLsec and pNEO vectors, respectively, as previously described ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 14. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ...

Biol. 2020; 27 :950-958 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, plasmids encoding proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) cells. The conditioned medium was concentrated using a QuixStand benchtop system. His-tagged Omicron RBD were purified with a 5 mL HisTrap nickel column (GE Healthcare) and further polished using a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Twin-strep tagged Omicron spike was purified with Strep-Tactin XT resin (IBA lifesciences).
∼4mg of ACE2 was mixed with homemade His-tagged 3C protease and DTT (final concentration 1mM). After incubation at 4 °C for one day, the sample was flowed through a 5 mL HisTrap nickel column (GE Healthcare). His-tagged proteins were removed by the nickel column and purified ACE2 was harvested and concentrated.
To purify full length IgG mAbs, supernatants of mAb expression were collected and filtered by a vacuum filter system and loaded on protein A/G beads over night at 4 °C. Beads were washed with PBS three times and 0.1 M glycine pH 2.7 was used to elute IgG. The eluate was neutralized with Tris-HCl pH 8 buffer to make the final pH=7. The IgG concentration was determined by spectrophotometry and buffer exchanged into PBS.
To express and purify Fabs 158 and EY6A, heavy chain and light chain expression plasmids of Fab were co-transfected into HEK293T cells by PEI. After culturing cells for 5 days at 37°C with 5% CO2, culture supernatant was harvested and filtered using a 0.22 mm polyethersulfone filter. Fab 158 was purified using Strep-Tactin XT resin (IBA lifesciences) and Fab EY6A was purified with Ni-NTA column (GE HealthCare) and a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare).
AstraZeneca and Regeneron antibodies were provided by AstraZeneca, Vir, Lilly and Adagio antibodies were provided by Adagio. For the antibodies heavy and light chains of the indicated antibodies were transiently transfected into 293Y cells and antibody purified from supernatant on protein A. Fab fragments of 58 and beta-55 were digested from purified IgGs with papain using a Pierce Fab Preparation Kit (Thermo Fisher), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare). All assays were performed with a running buffer of HBS-EP (Cytiva) at 25°C.
To determine the binding kinetics between the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and ACE2 / monoclonal antibody (mAb), a Protein A sensor chip (Cytiva) was used. ACE2-Fc or mAb was immobilised onto the sample flow cell of the sensor chip. The reference flow cell was left blank. RBD was injected over the two flow cells at a range of five concentrations prepared by serial twofold dilutions, at a flow rate of 30μl min −1 using a single-cycle kinetics programme. Running buffer was also injected using the same programme for background subtraction. All data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore T200 Evaluation Software 3.1.
Wuhan RBD was mixed with mAb-58 and mAb-158 Fabs, Wuhan or Omicron RBD was mixed with EY6A and beta-55 Fabs, in a 1:1:1 molar ratio, with a final concentration of 7, 7 and 3 mg ml −1 . These complexes were separately incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Initial screening of crystals was set up in Crystalquick 96-well X plates (Greiner Bio-One) with a Cartesian Robot using the nanoliter sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method, with 100 nL of protein plus 100 nL of reservoir in each drop for Wuhan RBD/mAb-58/mAb-158 and Wuhan RBD/EY6A/beta-55 complexes, and 200 nL of protein plus 100 nL of reservoir for Omicron RBD/EY6A/beta-55 complex, as previously described ( Walter et al., 2003 56. Walter, T.S. ∙ Diprose, J. ∙ Brown, J. ... A procedure for setting up high-throughput nanolitre crystallization experiments. I. Protocol design and validation J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36 :308-314 Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar ). Crystals of Wuhan RBD/mAb-58/mAb-158 were formed in Hampton Research PEGRx condition 2-28, containing 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic, pH 5.5 and 20% (w/v) PEG 4000. Crystals of Wuhan RBD/EY6A/beta-55 complex were obtained from Emerald Biostructures Wizard condition II-7, containing 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris, pH 6.7 and 30% (w/v) PEG 3000. Crystals of Omicron RBD/EY6A/beta-55 complex were formed in Hampton Research Index condition 80, containing 0.2 M (NH4)2COOH, 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5 and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350.
Crystals were mounted in loops and dipped in solution containing 25% glycerol and 75% mother liquor for a second before being frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline I03 of Diamond Light Source, UK. All data were collected as part of an automated queue system allowing unattended automated data collection ( https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I03/I03-Manual/Unattended-Data-Collections.html ). Diffraction images of 0.1° rotation were recorded on an Eiger2 XE 16M detector (exposure time from 0.02 to 0.03 s per image, beam size 80×20 μm or 50×20 μm, 10% to 30% beam transmission and wavelength of 0.9763 Å). Data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the automated data processing program Xia2-dials ( Winter, 2010; Winter et al., 2018 58.
