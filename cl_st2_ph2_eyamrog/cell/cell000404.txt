Title: DMA-tudor interaction modules control the specificity of in vivo condensates


Abstract: Summary

Biomolecular condensation is a widespread mechanism of cellular compartmentalization. Because the “survival of motor neuron protein” (SMN) is implicated in the formation of three different membraneless organelles (MLOs), we hypothesized that SMN promotes condensation. Unexpectedly, we found that SMN’s globular tudor domain was sufficient for dimerization-induced condensation in vivo , whereas its two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) were not. Binding to dimethylarginine (DMA) modified protein ligands was required for condensate formation by the tudor domains in SMN and at least seven other fly and human proteins. Remarkably, asymmetric versus symmetric DMA determined whether two distinct nuclear MLOs—gems and Cajal bodies—were separate or “docked” to one another. This substructure depended on the presence of either asymmetric or symmetric DMA as visualized with sub-diffraction microscopy. Thus, DMA-tudor interaction modules—combinations of tudor domains bound to their DMA ligand(s)—represent versatile yet specific regulators of MLO assembly, composition, and morphology.

Section: Introduction

In the past 10 years, molecular condensation of proteins and RNA has emerged as a prominent mode of subcellular organization ( Corbet and Parker, 2019 21. Corbet, G.A. ∙ Parker, R.

Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 Crossref Scopus (927) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our understanding of macromolecular structures formed by condensation has developed from descriptive characterization of organelles like P-granules and nucleoli to mechanistic models of how specific molecules promote phase transitions ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 8.

Although the mesoscale theoretical model of condensation has proven useful in many cases, an expansion of that conceptual framework has been called for to account for the specificity, selectivity, and function of membraneless organelles (MLOs) ( Alberti et al., 2019 1.

The necessity for a mechanistic understanding of these phenomena is particularly evident in the nucleus where MLOs—nucleoli, Cajal bodies, gems, histone locus bodies, speckles, and others—show considerable overlap in composition but nevertheless do not fuse into one body, instead maintaining their independence ( Machyna et al., 2013 56.

Those calls have been answered by significant steps forward in identifying key molecular features now known to promote the formation of condensates. Early in vitro work established that multivalent binding is a key attribute of condensate formation, and those results have led to a model of Arp2/3 actin regulatory condensates ( Case et al., 2019 14. Case, L.B. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Ditlev, J.A. ...

Li, P. ∙ Banjade, S. ∙ Cheng, H.C. ... Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins Nature. 2012; 483 :336-340 Crossref Scopus (935) PubMed Google Scholar ). Around the same time, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in RNA binding proteins were shown to promote condensate formation ( Kato et al., 2012 43. Kato, M. ∙ Han, T.W. ∙ Xie, S. ...

Phosphorylation-regulated binding of RNA polymerase II to fibrous polymers of low-complexity domains Cell. 2013; 155 :1049-1060 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations opened the floodgates for work seeking to explain how IDRs are encoded to produce condensates with the evident specificity and regulation seen for in vivo MLOs, resulting in a framework where IDRs consist of “sticker” interaction sites interspersed with flexible “spacers” ( Choi et al., 2020 20. Choi, J.M. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Pappu, R.V. Physical Principles Underlying the Complex Biology of Intracellular Phase Transitions Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2020; 49 :107-133 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). The capacity for amino acid residues to act as “stickers” provides a general explanation for why many IDRs readily phase separate in vitro ( Lin et al., 2015 50.

However, these studies have underscored the need to evaluate proteins suspected of promoting condensation on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, the IDRs of G3BP1 were recently reported to each contribute a unique effect on the condensation of stress granules ( Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020 34.

Equipped with a wealth of in vitro data and an emerging model for biomolecular condensation, the field is turning to address the mechanisms governing the specificity of condensate formation in the context of in vivo endogenous MLOs.
This study focuses on the “survival of motor neuron protein” (SMN), which is an essential component in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that are required for splicing ( Pellizzoni et al., 1998 67. Pellizzoni, L. ∙ Kataoka, N. ∙ Charroux, B. ...

SMN deficiency results in the fatal childhood disease, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA); yet, SMN’s snRNP biogenesis role does not adequately explain the disease phenotype because splicing is a required activity of every living cell ( Bühler et al., 1999 12. Bühler, D. ∙ Raker, V. ∙ Lührmann, R. ... Essential role for the tudor domain of SMN in spliceosomal U snRNP assembly: implications for spinal muscular atrophy Hum. Mol.

SMN depletion results in the loss of three membraneless compartments—gems, Cajal bodies, and U-bodies ( Girard et al., 2006 29. Girard, C. ∙ Neel, H. ∙ Bertrand, E. ...

Dynamic control of Cajal body number during zebrafish embryogenesis Nucleus. 2010; 1 :96-108 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Cytoplasmic SMN promotes the assembly of the Sm ring on snRNPs but its molecular function after import to the nucleus is less clear ( Bühler et al., 1999 12. Bühler, D. ∙ Raker, V. ∙ Lührmann, R. ...

Renvoisé, B. ∙ Khoobarry, K. ∙ Gendron, M.C. ... Distinct domains of the spinal muscular atrophy protein SMN are required for targeting to Cajal bodies in mammalian cells J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119 :680-692 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). How loss of cellular compartmentalization may contribute to SMA is currently unknown, but compromised Cajal body integrity has been reported in patient tissue ( Tapia et al., 2012 93. Tapia, O. ∙ Bengoechea, R. ∙ Palanca, A. ... Reorganization of Cajal bodies and nucleolar targeting of coilin in motor neurons of type I spinal muscular atrophy Histochem. Cell Biol. 2012; 137 :657-667 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore sought to understand how SMN supports the assembly of diverse MLOs.
Here, we examine the role of SMN in the formation of MLOs by isolating each region of the SMN protein to assess its condensation potential. To do so, we repurposed the “optodroplet” assay in which light is used to induce dimerization of protein domain candidates for condensation ( Shin et al., 2017 83. Shin, Y. ∙ Berry, J. ∙ Pannucci, N. ... Spatiotemporal Control of Intracellular Phase Transitions Using Light-Activated optoDroplets Cell. 2017; 168 :159-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unexpectedly, we found that the critical domain for condensation of SMN was its globular tudor domain, not its IDRs. We developed a new analysis of optodroplet data in order to make quantitative comparisons between condensations that account for the expression level of each protein. This allowed us to show that dimerization induced condensation of the SMN tudor domain depends on binding to the post-translational modification dimethyl arginine (DMA), and this property is shared among numerous additional tudor domains. Finally, using specific inhibitors of DMA synthesis, we found that it modulates the specific composition of two endogenous MLOs, Cajal bodies and gems. Our structure-function analysis of MLO formation reveals that the DMA-tudor module defines the specific composition of certain in vivo condensate MLOs.

Section: Results

SMN has three regions as distinguished by overall secondary structure ( Figure 1 A). N-terminal and C-terminal IDRs flank a single tudor domain that binds symmetric DMA on snRNP proteins and other ligands ( Friesen et al., 2001 26. Friesen, W.J. ∙ Massenet, S. ∙ Paushkin, S. ...

The N terminus contains a lysine-rich region, whereas the C terminus has a proline-rich tract and a tyrosine/glycine repeat motif; these IDRs are involved in SMN complex formation in the cytoplasm ( Grimm et al., 2013 32.

These features show high conservation among animal variants of SMN, and the IDRs resemble those that either form condensates or modulate the phase behavior of condensates once formed ( Berezin et al., 2004 5.

Although some IDRs can form droplets spontaneously in vitro , they often require multimerization to overcome nonspecific interactions and condense in vivo ( Protter et al., 2018 71. Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Rao, B.S. ∙ Van Treeck, B. ...

Spatiotemporal Control of Intracellular Phase Transitions Using Light-Activated optoDroplets Cell. 2017; 168 :159-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we fused each of the three SMN regions to the light-activated dimerization domain Cry2. This approach was previously exploited to form light-dependent “optodroplets” with IDRs expressed in NIH 3T3 cells ( Figure 1 B) ( Shin et al., 2017 83. Shin, Y. ∙ Berry, J. ∙ Pannucci, N. ... Spatiotemporal Control of Intracellular Phase Transitions Using Light-Activated optoDroplets Cell. 2017; 168 :159-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Providing negative and positive controls, respectively, mCherry-Cry2 did not form clusters upon light-induced dimerization, whereas FUS IDR and hnRNP-A1 IDR did ( Figure S1 A; Video S1 ). As expected, full-length SMN-Cry2 formed some clusters without light induction with additional clusters formed upon activation ( Figure S1 B; Video S2 ). We used this system to determine whether any portion of SMN directly promotes condensate formation in vivo .

Although we expected SMN’s IDRs to play a role in condensation, only its tudor domain (SMN Tud ) formed prominent clusters throughout the cell upon blue light activation ( Figures 1 C and S1 C; Video S3 ). These clusters were heterogenous and dynamic; when photobleached, they showed 42%–100% recovery with time constants of 30 ± 22 s (mean ± SD, n = 10) ( Figure S1 D). When Cry2 was allowed to deactivate after cluster formation, SMN Tud clusters dissipated within a few minutes ( Figure S1 E). Cluster fusion was infrequent but observable ( Figure S1 F). Together, these results show that SMN Tud clusters rapidly reorganize their internal molecular composition, consistent with liquid-like condensation rather than stable aggregates. We conclude that SMN Tud is sufficient for the formation of dynamic condensates upon light-induced multimerization.
Video (2.37 MB) Video S3. SMN Tud forms clusters in the optodroplet assay, related to Figure 1 NIH 3T3 cells expressing SMN Tud . At time 0.0, blue light is turned on to activate Cry2. Time resolution, 1.0 frame per second. Scale bar = 10 μm.
This finding was striking because tudor domains are small (60 amino acids), structured, and lack any obvious multivalency. We therefore asked whether condensate formation by SMN Tud depends on the presence of its ligands, which are DMA modified proteins. To do so, we developed an image analysis method to quantify condensate formation as a function of protein expression level, which is measured as each cell’s mean mCherry fluorescence. Our clustering metric is based on variance of intensity for each pixel throughout the movie recorded during Cry2 activation ( Figure S2 A). Correcting for the noise model of the camera and artifactual effects on variance, we obtained a clustering metric for each cell by averaging all pixels within segmented cell-by-cell masks and plotted it against expression level ( Figures S2 B and S2C; STAR Methods ). We determined a statistical threshold (Mann-Whitney U test) for the clustering metric of each cell relative to the mCherry-Cry2 negative control and found it to be at a clustering metric of ∼49.44 analog-digital units (ADU) ( Figure S2 C).
DMA modifications can either be asymmetric or symmetric (aDMA or sDMA) and each is produced by separate sets of methyltransferase enzymes ( Figure S2 D) ( Branscombe et al., 2001 10. Branscombe, T.L. ∙ Frankel, A. ∙ Lee, J.H. ... PRMT5 (Janus kinase-binding protein 1) catalyzes the formation of symmetric dimethylarginine residues in proteins J. Biol.

PRMT1 is the predominant type I protein arginine methyltransferase in mammalian cells J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :7723-7730 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). The SMN tudor domain has a higher affinity for sDMA but recognizes both sDMA and aDMA (K d = 0.476 mM and K d = 1.025 mM, respectively) ( Tripsianes et al., 2011 95. Tripsianes, K. ∙ Madl, T. ∙ Machyna, M. ... Structural basis for dimethylarginine recognition by the Tudor domains of human SMN and SPF30 proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1414-1420 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we chose two small-molecule inhibitors, MS-023 and EPZ015666, to deplete DMA modifications in NIH 3T3 cells ( Figure S2 E). MS-023 is a specific inhibitor of five type I methyltransferases that synthesize aDMA ( Eram et al., 2016 25. Eram, M.S. ∙ Shen, Y. ∙ Szewczyk, M. ... A Potent, Selective, and Cell-Active Inhibitor of Human Type I Protein Arginine Methyltransferases ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11 :772-781 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). EPZ015666 is a specific inhibitor of protein methyltransferase 5, which synthesizes most sDMA ( Chan-Penebre et al., 2015 15. Chan-Penebre, E. ∙ Kuplast, K.G. ∙ Majer, C.R. ... A selective inhibitor of PRMT5 with in vivo and in vitro potency in MCL models Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 :432-437 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that prolonged DMA inhibition substantially reduced the number of cells that form condensates above our significance threshold, despite the prevalence of residual DMA modified proteins after the 48-h treatment ( Figures 2 A–2C, S2 E, and S2F). From this, we conclude that condensation of SMN Tud depends on the availability of endogenous DMA ligands.
To verify that the loss of condensation is due to specific recognition of DMA by SMN Tud , we tested a series of mutants in the optodroplet assay. We chose three individually mutated amino acids in the aromatic cage that accepts DMA (W102L, Y109L, and Y130D), a disease-causing mutation associated with SMA (E134K) that also disrupts DMA binding, and an uninvolved phenylalanine as a control (F118L) ( Figure 2 A) ( Bühler et al., 1999 12. Bühler, D. ∙ Raker, V. ∙ Lührmann, R. ... Essential role for the tudor domain of SMN in spliceosomal U snRNP assembly: implications for spinal muscular atrophy Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8 :2351-2357 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Pellizzoni et al., 1999 68. Pellizzoni, L. ∙ Charroux, B. ∙ Dreyfuss, G.

USA. 1999; 96 :11167-11172 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tripsianes et al., 2011 95. Tripsianes, K. ∙ Madl, T. ∙ Machyna, M. ... Structural basis for dimethylarginine recognition by the Tudor domains of human SMN and SPF30 proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1414-1420 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). All four mutations that disrupt DMA-binding virtually eliminated condensation, but F118L did not ( Figures 2 D, 2E, and S3 ). From these combined data, we conclude that condensation of SMN Tud depends on binding to DMA ligands.
These findings prompted us to reexamine prior reports related to SMN’s role in MLOs and ask whether the same mutations prevent SMN from forming endogenous condensates. SMN depletion has been shown to disrupt nuclear MLOs and ectopic expression of SMN truncations and mutations can induce defects in tissue culture models ( Girard et al., 2006 29. Girard, C. ∙ Neel, H. ∙ Bertrand, E. ...

Dynamic control of Cajal body number during zebrafish embryogenesis Nucleus. 2010; 1 :96-108 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the role of the SMN tudor domain has not been studied in the context of a knockdown and rescue despite the association of the E134K mutation with SMA ( Pellizzoni et al., 1999 68. Pellizzoni, L. ∙ Charroux, B. ∙ Dreyfuss, G. SMN mutants of spinal muscular atrophy patients are defective in binding to snRNP proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :11167-11172 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). NIH 3T3 cells are a good model for optodroplet studies of SMN because they mostly lack MLOs that contain SMN, avoiding confounding effects of a preexisting assembly ( Figures S4 A and S4B). However, we wished to address the requirement for the tudor domain in the assembly activity of SMN. Instead of using NIH 3T3 cells, which lack SMN MLOs, we used HeLa cells, which normally display prominent SMN-rich MLOs known as gems; we then attempted to rescue the formation of gems in vivo by transfecting siRNA-resistant wild-type and mutant SMN constructs ( Figures 3 A and S4 C).
Expression of full-length, wild-type SMN in cells depleted of endogenous SMN restored nuclear puncta, which likely correspond to gems ( Figure 3 A) ( Young et al., 2001 104. Young, P.J. ∙ Le, T.T. ∙ Dunckley, M. ... Nuclear gems and Cajal (coiled) bodies in fetal tissues: nucleolar distribution of the spinal muscular atrophy protein, SMN Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265 :252-261 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, attempts to rescue the loss of wild-type puncta with SMN constructs bearing mutations to the tudor domain (E134K and Y109L) failed ( Figure 3 A). Quantification of these data demonstrate that the E134K mutation limited SMN to forming significantly smaller puncta that can be quite numerous, whereas Y109L nearly eliminated the punctate pattern in most nuclei ( Figures 3 B, 3C, and S4 H). These observations were independent of whether SMN localization was assayed by primary SMN antibodies or via a myc epitope tag included in the rescue construct ( Figure S4 D). Careful examination of our confocal data also indicate that SMN was still able to reach the nuclear compartment, ruling out localization alone as the cause of these effects ( Figures S4 E and S4F). We note that SMN mutants had partial effects on the formation of coilin-rich Cajal bodies, implying that the assembly of these proteins may not have a strict dependency on one another ( Figure S4 G). Thus, the ability of full-length SMN to form gems is strongly compromised by these two mutations that reduce the affinity of the SMN tudor domain for DMA.
Tudor domains, including the SMN tudor, are known to bind DMA on multiple target proteins ( Liu et al., 2012 53. Liu, K. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Liu, H. ... Crystal structure of TDRD3 and methyl-arginine binding characterization of TDRD3, SMN and SPF30 PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e30375 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tripsianes et al., 2011 95. Tripsianes, K. ∙ Madl, T. ∙ Machyna, M. ... Structural basis for dimethylarginine recognition by the Tudor domains of human SMN and SPF30 proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1414-1420 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we began testing known interactors of SMN for co-condensation with SMN Tud . DMA modified Sm proteins in snRNPs are canonical interactors of SMN, making them obvious first candidates ( Friesen et al., 2001 26. Friesen, W.J. ∙ Massenet, S. ∙ Paushkin, S. ... SMN, the product of the spinal muscular atrophy gene, binds preferentially to dimethylarginine-containing protein targets Mol. Cell. 2001; 7 :1111-1117 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, no snRNP marker colocalized with SMN Tud condensates, suggesting that Sm proteins do not participate in optodroplet formation by SMN Tud ( Figures S5 A–S5F). In contrast, endogenous coilin—the DMA-modified scaffolding protein of Cajal bodies—was detected in SMN Tud nuclear condensates ( Figure S5 G). These nuclear condensates recruit coilin from a soluble pool because the NIH 3T3 cells used do not have canonical (0.5–1.0 μm) Cajal bodies, although they do express coilin ( Figures S4 A and S4B). To determine if coilin association is essential for condensate formation by SMN Tud , Coil knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transduced with the Cry2 construct, and SMN Tud condensates still formed in response to blue light ( Figure S5 H). These observations confirm that SMN Tud can recruit coilin, a DMA-modified ligand, to condensates. We conclude that coilin is a non-essential ligand of SMN Tud in the context of this assay: it partitions into SMN Tud condensates but is not necessary for their formation.
To better understand the role of DMA ligands and to determine whether condensation of tudor domains is common, we turned to the eponymous protein of this domain family: D. melanogaster Tudor. The proteins Tudor, Aubergine, Vasa, and the oskar RNA make up the germ plasm condensate in flies ( Trcek and Lehmann, 2019 94. Trcek, T. ∙ Lehmann, R. Germ granules in Drosophila Traffic. 2019; 20 :650-660 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). DMA in the Aubergine N terminus is required for germ plasm localization, and the binding between this region and the eleventh tudor domain of Tudor has been studied by co-crystallization ( Liu et al., 2010 52. Liu, H. ∙ Wang, J.Y. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Structural basis for methylarginine-dependent recognition of Aubergine by Tudor Genes Dev. 2010; 24 :1876-1881 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated a Cry2 construct with this tudor domain plus flanking sequence known to increase specificity ( dm Tudor Tud ) and a construct with three repeats of the Aubergine N terminus fused to GFP (Aub 3 -GFP) ( Figures 4 A and S6 A). These constructs were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells. Dm Tudor Tud was able to form condensates in the nucleus of NIH 3T3 cells without the expression of Aubergine showing that endogenous mouse DMA ligands suffice ( Figure 4 B). Accordingly, treatment with the sDMA inhibitor EPZ015666 prevented condensation ( Figure 4 C). The requirement for sDMA was further confirmed by the presence of SYM10 and SYM11 epitopes in dm Tudor Tud condensates, two antibodies that recognize a constellation of sDMA modified sequences ( Figure 4 D). Co-expression with Aub 3 -GFP, predominantly modified by aDMA, blocked condensate formation ( Figures 4 E and 4F), suggesting that Aub 3 -GFP can compete with the endogenous proteins modified by sDMA. When lysine was substituted for arginine in Aub 3 -GFP, condensation was restored, confirming the necessity of the DMA-tudor interaction. Finally, the endogenous proteins that allow dm Tudor Tud to condense must be nuclear, because no condensation effect was seen in the cytoplasm. The recognition of a mouse protein by dm Tudor Tud likely reflects the previously characterized promiscuity of tudor domain recognition of DMA targets ( Liu et al., 2012 53. Liu, K. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Liu, H. ... Crystal structure of TDRD3 and methyl-arginine binding characterization of TDRD3, SMN and SPF30 PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e30375 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, it appears that the balance between sDMA and aDMA determines the degree of assembly mediated by the DMA- dm Tudor Tud module.
Given two examples of tudor domains that form condensates from two species, we asked if this property could be more broadly generalized. The human proteome has fifty-five annotated tudor domains from twenty-eight different proteins in the Uniprot database. Because each tudor domain binds a discrete set of DMA ligands due to amino acids surrounding the modified arginine, the condensation property observed for SMN Tud could be unique ( Liu et al., 2012 53. Liu, K. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Liu, H. ... Crystal structure of TDRD3 and methyl-arginine binding characterization of TDRD3, SMN and SPF30 PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e30375 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tripsianes et al., 2011 95. Tripsianes, K. ∙ Madl, T. ∙ Machyna, M. ... Structural basis for dimethylarginine recognition by the Tudor domains of human SMN and SPF30 proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1414-1420 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, the tendency to condense could be shared with other tudor domains. To test for generality, we selected a panel of twelve domains from nine different human proteins from diverse biochemical processes ( Figure 5 A). The twelve selected have the four aromatic amino acids required to form the binding pocket for DMA ( Figure S6 D). Of these domains, we provide evidence for six that formed condensates ( Figures 5 B and S6 E–S6G). As constructed, the assay is best suited to rule-in rather than rule-out domains, so we employed the clustering metric in live cells to assess whether expression level alone dictates whether a tudor domain makes condensates ( Figure S6 A). We compared SMN Tud and Spf30 Tud and found that Spf30 Tud did not condense across a range of concentrations even though SMN and Spf30 are closely related homologs ( Figure S6 C) ( Tripsianes et al., 2011 95. Tripsianes, K. ∙ Madl, T. ∙ Machyna, M. ... Structural basis for dimethylarginine recognition by the Tudor domains of human SMN and SPF30 proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1414-1420 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). To validate our findings for tudor domains that do form condensates, we repeated our experiment expressing tudor-Cry2 constructs with mutations in the consensus second tyrosine of the DMA binding motif ( Figure S6 D). All of these mutations profoundly reduced condensate formation ( Figure 5 C). Intriguingly, we found that SYM10 DMA epitopes reside in some, but not all, Tdrd8 Tud condensates, aDMA inhibitors eliminate Tdrd3 Tud cytoplasmic condensates but not nuclear condensates, and Snd1 Tud localization itself changes when it can no longer bind DMA ( Figures 5 C and S6 F–S6H). Taken together, these data suggest that the ability of any tudor domain to mediate condensation may depend on the localization, availability, expression level, and methylation status of suitable partner molecules.
To better understand how DMA-tudor interactions affect endogenous MLOs, we asked what specific effects arginine dimethylation has on the Cajal body. HeLa cells were treated with the specific inhibitors of DMA synthesis, MS-023 and EPZ015666, and monitored for effects on Cajal bodies. Typically, HeLa cell Cajal bodies contain partially overlapping coilin and SMN domains ( Figure 6 A). The direction of these shifts is random but consistently observed ruling out chromatic aberration as their source ( Figure S7 A). Inhibition by both inhibitors results in the disassembly of Cajal bodies where residual coilin puncta lack the trimethylguanosine snRNP marker, in agreement with previous findings using a non-specific methylation inhibitor ( Figures 6 B, S7 B, and S7C) ( Hebert et al., 2002 39. Hebert, M.D. ∙ Shpargel, K.B. ∙ Ospina, J.K. ... Coilin methylation regulates nuclear body formation Dev. Cell. 2002; 3 :329-337 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). We note that SMN-containing nuclear puncta remain, which are likely gems that can form through recognition of residual DMA modified proteins (see Figure S2 E) ( Young et al., 2001 104. Young, P.J. ∙ Le, T.T. ∙ Dunckley, M. ... Nuclear gems and Cajal (coiled) bodies in fetal tissues: nucleolar distribution of the spinal muscular atrophy protein, SMN Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265 :252-261 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the integrity of the Cajal body nuclear organelle depends on modification of arginine, presumably on coilin.
Treatment of cells with individual inhibitors revealed an important requirement for the organization of Cajal bodies, gems, and their specificity. Inhibition of aDMA synthesis merges coilin and SMN into one fully overlapping body ( Figure 6 C). In contrast, inhibition of sDMA synthesis induces the complete separation of the coilin and SMN domains into two distinct bodies ( Figure 6 D). Importantly, trimethylguanosine continues to colocalize with coilin in both conditions, indicating snRNPs are still present with coilin in Cajal bodies with both individual inhibitors ( Figures S7 B–S7E). Thus, the Cajal body is dependent on arginine methylation overall, and symmetrical dimethylarginine—the highest affinity SMN tudor domain ligand ( Tripsianes et al., 2011 95. Tripsianes, K. ∙ Madl, T. ∙ Machyna, M. ... Structural basis for dimethylarginine recognition by the Tudor domains of human SMN and SPF30 proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1414-1420 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar )—is required for the merging of Cajal bodies and gems into a single nuclear body.
To further understand the relationship between these two proteins and their spatial regulation by DMA, we turned to stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) to assess the arrangement of SMN and coilin below the diffraction limit. Using a STED modality with isotropic resolution of about 32 nm, we found that the coilin-containing structure in untreated HeLa cells often has a cleft within which SMN resides ( Figures 6 E and S7 F). Assessing twenty Cajal bodies from twenty different cells per condition using lateral depletion STED, we observe that the offset between SMN and coilin is substantially diminished by inhibiting aDMA synthesis, and that the coilin cleft is no longer apparent ( Figures 6 F, 6G, S7 G, and S7H). We suggest that normal levels of sDMA and aDMA appear to promote “docking” of the Cajal body to gems, where SMN and coilin adopt a ball-in-socket configuration. These two organelles can either share components or retain distinct identities based on the specific form of arginine methylation. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the DMA-tudor module controls the compositional specificity of these nuclear MLOs.

Section: Discussion

Two key concepts emerge from this study. First, globular tudor domains promote condensation in vivo , by binding specifically to ligands bearing the modified amino acid dimethylarginine or DMA. We have named this active unit the “DMA-tudor module” ( Figure 7 ). Second, the particular constellation of DMA-tudor modules comprising aDMA and sDMA ligands determines the integrity of endogenous membraneless organelles (MLOs) exemplified by Cajal bodies and gems. Specifically, Cajal bodies require aDMA and sDMA, and DMA determines whether Cajal bodies and gems associate with one another. It was previously assumed that these MLOs mix their contents ( Hebert and Matera, 2000 37. Hebert, M.D. ∙ Matera, A.G. Self-association of coilin reveals a common theme in nuclear body localization Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 :4159-4171 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and Cajal bodies form by biomolecular condensation; this study provides evidence for biomolecular condensation and mechanistic insights into the assembly and composition of this MLO ( Corbet and Parker, 2019 21. Corbet, G.A. ∙ Parker, R. RNP Granule Formation: Lessons from P-Bodies and Stress Granules Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2019; 84 :203-215 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hyman et al., 2014 41. Hyman, A.A. ∙ Weber, C.A. ∙ Jülicher, F. Liquid-liquid phase separation in biology Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30 :39-58 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 84. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 Crossref Scopus (927) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, STED microscopy indicates these MLOs remain distinct and instead “dock” with one another when aDMA and sDMA are both present ( Figure 7 ). Finally, the docking principle reveals rules governing the specificity of MLO composition controlled by post-translational modifications. We provide evidence that additional DMA-tudor modules involving tudor domain-containing proteins with vastly different functions have the capacity to mediate condensation in other contexts, such as chromatin and germ plasm.
The DMA-tudor module is set apart from other specific interactions in condensates because it is based on a post-translational modification. In this way, it attains switch-like properties akin to the module formed by SH2 domains and phospho-tyrosine in Nck actin signaling condensates ( Banjade et al., 2015 4. Banjade, S. ∙ Wu, Q. ∙ Mittal, A. ... Conserved interdomain linker promotes phase separation of the multivalent adaptor protein Nck Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E6426-E6435 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, DMA-tudor condensates are not nucleated on a two-dimensional lipid membrane and do not change the charge of the modified amino acid. Nuclear MLOs like nucleoli and Cajal bodies are dynamic, disassembling during mitosis or cellular stress and reassembling quickly thereafter ( Boulon et al., 2010 7. Boulon, S. ∙ Westman, B.J. ∙ Hutten, S. ... The nucleolus under stress Mol. Cell. 2010; 40 :216-227 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (628) PubMed Google Scholar ; Strzelecka et al., 2010a 90. Strzelecka, M. ∙ Oates, A.C. ∙ Neugebauer, K.M. Dynamic control of Cajal body number during zebrafish embryogenesis Nucleus. 2010; 1 :96-108 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). More broadly, remodeling of condensates in response to cell signaling has been proposed as a key mechanism of transcriptional regulation via the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain ( Guo et al., 2019 35. Guo, Y.E. ∙ Manteiga, J.C. ∙ Henninger, J.E. ... Pol II phosphorylation regulates a switch between transcriptional and splicing condensates Nature. 2019; 572 :543-548 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kwon et al., 2013 44.

Phosphorylation-regulated binding of RNA polymerase II to fibrous polymers of low-complexity domains Cell. 2013; 155 :1049-1060 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). The modification of arginine has already been proposed as a way by which cells may modulate condensation by IDRs in cis ( Nott et al., 2015 62. Nott, T.J. ∙ Petsalaki, E. ∙ Farber, P. ...

Cell. 2018; 69 :465-479 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ); this model explains condensate formation by the RGG regions of FUS, which is suppressed by aDMA ( Hofweber et al., 2018 40. Hofweber, M. ∙ Hutten, S. ∙ Bourgeois, B. ...

Our results demonstrate that in vivo the situation can become far more complex beyond changing the chemical properties of the modified residues. DMA recruits the interaction of tudor domain proteins in trans and may promote or antagonize condensation depending on the properties of the tudor domain protein. One demethylase for aDMA has been identified, making the modification reversible and potentially dynamic ( Chang et al., 2007 16. Chang, B. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Zhao, Y. ... JMJD6 is a histone arginine demethylase Science. 2007; 318 :444-447 Crossref Scopus (465) PubMed Google Scholar ). Much is still unknown about how methyltransferases either differentiate between—or compete for—substrates for aDMA or sDMA modification.
Although we focused on tudor domains most likely to bind DMA, the tudor superfamily contains a spectrum of domains that bind other ligands or could bind DMA in a non-canonical manner ( Chen et al., 2011 17. Chen, C. ∙ Nott, T.J. ∙ Jin, J. ... Deciphering arginine methylation: Tudor tells the tale Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :629-642 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). How DMA acts to regulate many condensates in vivo is unexplored. DMA modifications have been found on a vast and growing list of proteins including histones, RNA polymerase II, and G3BP1 ( Chitiprolu et al., 2018 18. Chitiprolu, M. ∙ Jagow, C. ∙ Tremblay, V. ...

SMN and symmetric arginine dimethylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain control termination Nature. 2016; 529 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). These proteins are associated with chromatin, transcription, and stress granules, respectively. Notably, all are systems reported to act as condensates in vivo , raising the possibility that tudor domain proteins and DMA play regulatory roles in their assembly and/or disassembly ( Gibson et al., 2019 28.

Phase separation by low complexity domains promotes stress granule assembly and drives pathological fibrillization Cell. 2015; 163 :123-133 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (997) PubMed Google Scholar ). The coactivator Tdrd3 uses its tudor domain to read aDMA modifications on core histone tails (H3R17me2a and H4R3me2a) and the CTD of RNA polymerase II at transcription start sites ( Yang et al., 2010 102. Yang, Y. ∙ Lu, Y. ∙ Espejo, A. ... TDRD3 is an effector molecule for arginine-methylated histone marks Mol.

Arginine methylation facilitates the recruitment of TOP3B to chromatin to prevent R loop accumulation Mol. Cell. 2014; 53 :484-497 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). During cellular stress, Tdrd3’s tudor domain targets the protein to stress granules ( Goulet et al., 2008 31. Goulet, I. ∙ Boisvenue, S. ∙ Mokas, S. ... TDRD3, a novel Tudor domain-containing protein, localizes to cytoplasmic stress granules Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17 :3055-3074 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, other tudor-domain regulators recognize DMA on histone tails ( Lu and Wang, 2013 54. Lu, R. ∙ Wang, G.G. Tudor: a versatile family of histone methylation ‘readers’ Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38 :546-555 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our findings, we speculate that these activities may involve condensation by tudor domains, which could also behave in a switch-like manner depending on the methylation state of the histone tails.
The Cry2 assay, combined here with analysis that relates condensation to protein expression level, reveals that a modest increase in valency through light-activated dimerization of tudor domains is enough to induce condensation ( Bugaj et al., 2013 11. Bugaj, L.J. ∙ Choksi, A.T. ∙ Mesuda, C.K. ... Optogenetic protein clustering and signaling activation in mammalian cells Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :249-252 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin et al., 2017 83. Shin, Y. ∙ Berry, J. ∙ Pannucci, N. ... Spatiotemporal Control of Intracellular Phase Transitions Using Light-Activated optoDroplets Cell. 2017; 168 :159-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore striking that tudor domain proteins can have eight or more tudor domains in addition to other interaction modules ( Gan et al., 2019 27. Gan, B. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Liu, H. ... Structure and function of eTudor domain containing TDRD proteins Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2019; 54 :119-132 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). The inherent multivalency of proteins like Tdrd4 and Tdrd6 implies a mechanism for germline condensate formation, supported by our study of the original “Tudor” protein from D. melanogaster . Modified proteins often have multiple modified residues, offering avidity as an explanation for how relatively low-affinity individual interactions allow for assembly ( Tripsianes et al., 2011 95. Tripsianes, K. ∙ Madl, T. ∙ Machyna, M. ... Structural basis for dimethylarginine recognition by the Tudor domains of human SMN and SPF30 proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1414-1420 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we show nuclear localization-specific condensation by dm Tudor Tud and a lack of DMA-containing snRNPs in SMN Tud condensates. Although there are many gaps in our knowledge about tudor domains and their ligands, each tudor domain exerts selectivity over the ligands bound, and not every methylated ligand is in every condensate. Because condensation is dependent on the concentration of the active unit required to separate from the bulk phase, the concentration of tudor domains and their available ligands likely determine when and whether condensates form ( Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015 24. Elbaum-Garfinkle, S. ∙ Kim, Y. ∙ Szczepaniak, K. ... The disordered P granule protein LAF-1 drives phase separation into droplets with tunable viscosity and dynamics Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :7189-7194 Crossref Scopus (474) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2012 48. Li, P. ∙ Banjade, S. ∙ Cheng, H.C. ... Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins Nature. 2012; 483 :336-340 Crossref Scopus (935) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pak et al., 2016 65.

Cell. 2016; 63 :72-85 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, our data should be viewed as ruling-in certain tudor domains for condensation at the concentrations expressed stably in NIH 3T3 cells. Others may form condensates at higher concentrations or in the presence of other ligands. Thus, we discovered a role for tudor domain ligands and their regulation. Taken together, the DMA-tudor module has the properties of a highly versatile mechanism for cellular condensation.
At a minimum, two developmentally important MLOs—the Cajal body and germ plasm—are controlled by the DMA modification ( Hebert et al., 2002 39. Hebert, M.D. ∙ Shpargel, K.B. ∙ Ospina, J.K. ...

Cell. 2015; 57 :936-947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings explain how DMA modification is able to control the composition of the Cajal body and its relationship to gems. Prior studies had observed that coilin methylation is required for its interaction with SMN, and inhibition of all cellular methylation disrupts Cajal body assembly ( Hebert et al., 2002 39. Hebert, M.D. ∙ Shpargel, K.B. ∙ Ospina, J.K. ... Coilin methylation regulates nuclear body formation Dev. Cell. 2002; 3 :329-337 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our work connects the current understanding of condensation to the past observation that coilin must bear a methylated arginine-glycine motif to form a Cajal body ( Hebert et al., 2001 38. Hebert, M.D. ∙ Szymczyk, P.W. ∙ Shpargel, K.B. ... Coilin forms the bridge between Cajal bodies and SMN, the spinal muscular atrophy protein Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :2720-2729 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). We additionally build on prior observations that depletion of SMN reduces the number of gems and Cajal bodies ( Girard et al., 2006 29. Girard, C. ∙ Neel, H. ∙ Bertrand, E. ... Depletion of SMN by RNA interference in HeLa cells induces defects in Cajal body formation Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 :2925-2932 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lemm et al., 2006 47.

Coilin-dependent snRNP assembly is essential for zebrafish embryogenesis Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 :403-409 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), showing that the tudor domain mutations placed in the context of the full-length SMN protein cannot restore the proper constellation of MLOs in cells. Partial complementation of Cajal body defects by expression of SMN tudor domain mutants may be possible because the SMN IDRs in the N and C termini support protein-protein interactions including SMN oligomerization ( Grimm et al., 2013 32.

STED microscopy revealed substructure within the Cajal body that relates DNA-tudor module interactions to the specific composition of the MLO. Specifically, a “ball-in-socket” arrangement of SMN (ball) and coilin (socket) resolves major domains of the compartment that have been hinted at previously ( Novotny et al., 2015 63. Novotny, I. ∙ Malinova, A. ∙ Stejskalova, E. ... SART3-Dependent Accumulation of Incomplete Spliceosomal snRNPs in Cajal Bodies Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :429-440 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unperturbed, Cajal bodies and gems are “docked” to one another in this configuration, which is disrupted by aDMA depletion. Conversely, sDMA promotes the fusion of SMN-rich gems with Cajal bodies, showing that the precise form of this post translational mark dictates the occupancy of the body. These observations imply that an equilibrium between aDMA and sDMA exists in HeLa cells and provokes speculation that the interface between SMN and coilin might be controlled by the proportion of each modification. Such docked arrangements may apply to other MLOs, such as Cajal bodies and nucleoli under stress conditions, the transcriptional machinery, cytoplasmic RNPs, and unfolded protein condensates ( Boulon et al., 2010 7.

The creation of interfaces between different protein condensation states may be critical to certain chemical events in cells, such as pre-mRNA splicing ( Gordon et al., 2021 30. Gordon, J.M. ∙ Phizicky, D.V. ∙ Neugebauer, K.M. Nuclear mechanisms of gene expression control: pre-mRNA splicing as a life or death decision Curr. Opin. Genet.

Splicing at the phase-separated nuclear speckle interface: a model Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :636-645 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our discovery of a mechanistic explanation for substructure in the Cajal body prompts future investigation of the molecules belonging to gems, Cajal bodies, nucleoli, and histone locus bodies—four distinct MLOs with known overlaps in composition ( Machyna et al., 2013 56. Machyna, M. ∙ Heyn, P. ∙ Neugebauer, K.M. Cajal bodies: where form meets function Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2013; 4 :17-34 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Considerable effort has gone into developing the most appropriate theoretical framework to understand condensates ( Banani et al., 2017 3. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Crossref Scopus (1352) PubMed Google Scholar ; Choi et al., 2020 20.

A framework for understanding the functions of biomolecular condensates across scales Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2021; 22 :215-235 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2018 99. Wang, J. ∙ Choi, J.M. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ... A Molecular Grammar Governing the Driving Forces for Phase Separation of Prion-like RNA Binding Proteins Cell. 2018; 174 :688-699 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of DMA-tudor, the “polyphasic linkage” framework is most applicable ( Wyman and Gill, 1980 101. Wyman, J. ∙ Gill, S.J. Ligand-linked phase changes in a biological system: applications to sickle cell hemoglobin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1980; 77 :5239-5242 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Taking either tudor domain proteins to be scaffolds and DMA-modified proteins to be ligands, the resulting condensates would have tunable properties based on the degree of post-translational modification ( Ruff et al., 2021 76. Ruff, K.M. ∙ Dar, F. ∙ Pappu, R.V. Ligand effects on phase separation of multivalent macromolecules Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2017184118 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study does not address the specific effects of DMA modification on the critical concentrations of either SMN or its ligands. Such an analysis on SMN or another tudor domain protein is an important future step toward understanding how evolution has selected for specific condensation conditions. Several motifs in SMN’s IDRs are conserved in animals, particularly among those species whose SMN can rescue SMA model mice ( Figure 1 A) ( Osman et al., 2019 64. Osman, E.Y. ∙ Bolding, M.R. ∙ Villalón, E. ... Functional characterization of SMN evolution in mouse models of SMA Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :9472 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taking the view that the SMN IDRs may act as spacers or modulators of tudor condensation activity, a detailed biophysical analysis of this protein is now possible.
The rules governing specificity and composition of condensates have been intensely sought after. Although IDRs contribute important interactions to the formation of condensates, it is becoming clear that specific interactions are also required to form endogenous organelles via phase separation ( Wang et al., 2018 99. Wang, J. ∙ Choi, J.M. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ... A Molecular Grammar Governing the Driving Forces for Phase Separation of Prion-like RNA Binding Proteins Cell. 2018; 174 :688-699 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ). The base pairing and secondary structure of RNA has recently been shown to play an important role ( Langdon et al., 2018 45. Langdon, E.M. ∙ Qiu, Y. ∙ Ghanbari Niaki, A. ... mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation Science. 2018; 360 :922-927 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ; Van Treeck et al., 2018 98. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). In vitro studies have shown that molecular recognition between folded domains can promote occupancy in a condensate ( Ditlev et al., 2018 23. Ditlev, J.A. ∙ Case, L.B. ∙ Rosen, M.K. Who’s In and Who’s Out-Compositional Control of Biomolecular Condensates J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4666-4684 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clearly, the prolific nature of both tudor domain-containing proteins and DMA-modified proteins leaves open many opportunities for this mechanism to play out throughout the cell. Our study reveals that DMA-tudor modules provide the requisite specificity for the formation of endogenous MLOs and enforce a distinct substructure. We speculate that biomolecular condensation in vivo can be driven by specific interactions of each tudor domain with its DMA ligands. Furthermore, the switch-like binding changes induced by the symmetry of the installed methyl groups introduces versatility and regulation, which can in turn define the identity and specific composition of MLOs formed through the activity of DMA-tudor modules.
This study reveals several important questions with answers lying beyond the scope of the experiments presented here. First, although we were able to leverage differences in tissue culture cells to maximize the impact of our conclusions, how these results generalize to other cell models and tissues remains to be tested. We speculate that the activity of the methyltransferases in specific cell types is a key variable that must be addressed to understand MLO formation. Related to this, our study does not address the identity or stoichiometry of DMA-modified ligands. We were limited to a relatively small selection of small-molecule inhibitors of DMA synthesis, and until more is known about how the methyltransferases work together to regulate assembly via the DMA-tudor module, we can only speculate on the underlying mechanism that allows for residual SMN condensation in our assays.

NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC (# CRL-1658), HeLa cells are from the Kyoto lineage (RRID: CVCL_1922), and coil −/− - Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF) were a gift from Greg Matera ( Tucker et al., 2001 97. Tucker, K.E. ∙ Berciano, M.T. ∙ Jacobs, E.Y. ... Residual Cajal bodies in coilin knockout mice fail to recruit Sm snRNPs and SMN, the spinal muscular atrophy gene product J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154 :293-307 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). 293FT cells were obtained from Thermo (#R70007) but were not used as a model and only for packaging lentivirus. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin (GIBCO). All cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were regularly screened for the presence of mycoplasma infection.
The plasmid system for lentiviral generation included pHR_SFFV (generated by Wendell Lim, Addgene #79121), pMD2.G (generated by Didier Trono, Addgene # 12259), and pCMVR 8.74 (generated by Didier Trono, Addgene # 22036). pHR_SFFV containing the IDRs of FUS and hnRNP-A1 were gifts from Cliff Brangwynne (Princeton University). Constructs in Table S1 below were generated with the InFusion HD kit (Takara) by replacing the sequence upstream of mCherry-Cry2 in pHR_SFFV-hnRNPA1-mCherry-Cry2. Aubergine peptide constructs were generated by inserting sequence upstream of GFP in pLV-EGFP (generated by Pantelis Tsoulfas, Addgene #36083, modified by David Phizicky) and expressed from the eIF4a promoter. Point mutations to SMN Tud were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.
Pools of cells stably expressing Cry2 constructs were generated by first transfecting either pHR_SFFV or pLV-EGFP with the desired insert, pMD2.G, and pCMV R8.74 into confluent 293FT. Transfection was performed with the Fugene HD reagent (Promega). After 48-72 h, viral supernatant was harvested, filtered, and applied to NIH 3T3 or coil −/− - MEF ( Tucker et al., 2001 97. Tucker, K.E. ∙ Berciano, M.T. ∙ Jacobs, E.Y. ... Residual Cajal bodies in coilin knockout mice fail to recruit Sm snRNPs and SMN, the spinal muscular atrophy gene product J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154 :293-307 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). For live cell imaging, NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in glass-bottomed 35 mm dishes (MatTek). Just before imaging, the media was replaced with Live Cell Imaging Solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mM glucose and 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen).
All live cell imaging was carried out on a Bruker Opterra II Swept Field instrument. The system allows for simultaneous imaging of mCherry fluorescence with the 561 nm laser and field of view activation of Cry2 with the 488 nm laser. The instrument is equipped with a Photometrics Evolve 512 Delta EMCCD camera. A standard protocol was used to make all Cry2 measurements. A PlanApo 60X 1.2 NA water immersion objective (Nikon) and a slit aperture of 70 μm was used to image at four frames per second. Four-frame averaging resulted in an overall frame rate of one frame per second. The 561 nm laser was set to 80% of full power and the 488 nm was set to 25% of full power. Both were passed through a 20% neutral density filter. We measured power output at the objective to be 80-90 μW for 561 nm and 20-25 μW for 488 nm with a Thorlabs PM100D power meter and a S170C sensor.
For each field of view, 10 s of inactive Cry2 were recorded, followed by turning on the 488 nm laser to capture 180 s of active Cry2. At the end of the series, a reference image of nuclear Hoechst staining was collected using the 405 nm laser. A stage-top incubator was employed to maintain cells at 37°C throughout imaging.
FRAP measurements were taken using identical imaging conditions as above with the following modifications. The objective was changed to a PlanApo 100X 1.4 NA oil immersion objective (Nikon). Frame averaging was replaced with a maximum projection of 7-11 z-steps at each time point, 0.25 s exposure per frame. After 180 s of activation, a single condensate was photobleached using a pulse of 405 nm laser light. The background was subtracted from a bleached region of interest containing a condensate using an unclustered region of the same cell. The intensity was then normalized to the maximum and minimum intensity values. Each recovery curve was fit using a one-phase exponential to estimate the mobile fraction and characteristic recovery time (1/ e recovery, tau).
DMA inhibition was achieved by either individual or simultaneous treatment with two drugs: MS-023 (Sigma) and EPZ015666 (Sigma) ( Chan-Penebre et al., 2015 15. Chan-Penebre, E. ∙ Kuplast, K.G. ∙ Majer, C.R. ... A selective inhibitor of PRMT5 with in vivo and in vitro potency in MCL models Nat. Chem.

A Potent, Selective, and Cell-Active Inhibitor of Human Type I Protein Arginine Methyltransferases ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11 :772-781 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stock solutions were prepared in DMSO at 50 mM and all subsequent dilutions were done in cell media as described above. MS-023 was added to media at a final concentration of 1.0 μM, and EPZ015666 was added at a final concentration of 5.0 μM. After 48 h of drug treatment, imaging was carried out as above, with drug added to the same concentration in the imaging media.
Cells were grown on No. 1.5 coverslips (Zeiss) in six-well plates and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), blocked in 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma) and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 (American Bioanalytical). If immunofluorescence was performed, staining was conducted in blocking buffer with the antibodies listed in Table S2 . For Cry2 activation prior to fixation, we built a custom illumination array designed for six-well plates. Six blue LEDs (470 nm, 3.2 V, Digi-Key 150080BS75000) were arrayed to illuminate each well in a six-well plate for 5 min ( Figure S6 B). Illumination was maintained during the 10 min fixation step. Inactive Cry2 samples were maintained in the dark for 10 min and fixed in the same manner. Imaging was done on a Leica Sp8 Laser Scanning Confocal.
SMN depletion was achieved by transfection of a pool of Silencer Select siRNAs (Thermo, cat# 4427037, siRNA codes s445227, s531465, s531467) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo). Rescue construct expression was achieved by transfecting degradation resistant constructs for SMN after 24 hr of knockdown depletion using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo). Cells were fixed as described above after 48 total hours of knockdown depletion. The expression of the SMN rescue construct was assessed immunofluorescence staining for SMN and for a C-terminal myc epitope tag. No difference in patterning was found between the two stains.
Western blots were carried out by preparing whole cell lysate in 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0). Lysates were denatured and reduced by adding NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Thermo) and heating for 10 min at 85°C. Samples were run out on a 4%–12% acrylamide Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). After blocking, membranes were stained with the antibodies listed in Table S2 .
Two modalities of STED microscopy were used in this study: lateral depletion profile STED and three dimensional isoSTED. Two-dimensional STED was carried out using a Leica Sp8 Laser Scanning Confocal enabled with a 775nm depletion laser. Atto 594 and Atto 647N secondary antibodies were used to facilitate two color STED. For isoSTED nanoscopy, The samples were mounted between two 25-mm-diameter, 170-μm-thick coverslips (CSHP-No1.5-25, Bioscience Tools). Mounting medium (Prolong Diamond, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to supply anti-fade protection and to reduce the refractive index difference between the sample and the objective’s immersion silicon oil. The samples were imaged with a custom-built isoSTED nanoscope as previously described ( Hao et al., 2020 36. Hao, X. ∙ Allgeyer, E.S. ∙ Antonello, J. ... 3D Adaptive Optical Nanoscopy for Thick Specimen Imaging at sub-50 nm Resolution bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Briefly, depletion laser beams interfere at the common focus of two opposing objectives (100 x/1.35NA, silicon oil immersion, Olympus) in a 4Pi geometry to create a three-dimensional isotropic zero-intensity minimum at the center of the focus ( Bewersdorf et al., 2006 6.

Spherical nanosized focal spot unravels the interior of cells Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :539-544 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ). The instrument was equipped with a pulsed excitation laser at a wavelength of 650 nm (LDH-P-C-650 m, PicoQuant) and an 80-MHz pulsed depletion laser with a pulse length of ∼600 ps and wavelength of 775 nm (Kantana HP, OneFive). A 16-kHz resonance mirror (SC-30, EOPC) scans the combined laser beams along the fast scanning axis, while two synchronized galvanometer scanning mirror (dynAXIS XS, SCANLAB) scan the beams along the slow scanning axis. Fluorescence was detected by a single-photon counting avalanche photodiode (APD, SPCM-ACRH-13-FC, Excelitas). All data were acquired with 500 line accumulations, ∼10 μW of the 650 nm laser, and ∼60 mW of the 775 nm laser (power measured at the back focal plane of each objective lens). Z stacks were acquired from 40 optical sections at 25-nm intervals in a field of view of 256 by 256 pixels and a pixel size of 19.5 nm.
Quantification of condensate formation on a per-cell basis requires accurate segmentation of cells within a field of view. A cell profiler pipeline was used to process movies into cell masks. Binary nuclear masks were generated by segmenting the Hoechst image associated with each sequence. Binary cellular masks were generated by performing an Otsu threshold and watershed transform seeded by the nuclear masks on the mCherry signal from inactive Cry2 cells. Masks defined by automated segmentation were manually checked for accuracy; cells with substantial movement from the mask were excluded from analysis.
We use a temporal variance metric to quantify clustering without imposing a model on the time-dependence or shape, in an expression-level independent manner. Fluorophores moving into or out of a pixel will increase the temporal variance, substantially for pixels seeing large fluxes of fluorophores. However, as photon-counting processes are subject to shot-noise, the temporal variance of a pixel will also increase with baseline intensity increases, which would confound comparison between cells of differing expression levels. This effect can be conveniently normalized using the temporal mean, since the variance and expectation value of a Poisson process are equal. Several effects which deviate our raw analog-digital counts from this model were therefore accounted for before calculating the clustering metric.
First, the per-pixel analog-digital offset of the camera was characterized and subtracted from all images. We often observe very bright spots appearing on single frames at random positions, which we interpret to be particles or cosmic rays impacting the EMCCD. Such large spikes in intensity can bias variance-based calculations, and because these spikes sometimes occur within cell masks, we filter them using a temporal sliding-window approach ( Figure S2 B). We iterate through time and calculate the median-absolute deviation (MAD) at each xy -pixel within a 10-frame window, where the MAD of a sequence k is simply 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( | 𝑘 − 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑘 ) | ) . Values within this window were identified as spikes if they were both larger than 15 times the MAD and were increases on the previous frame larger than 1500 ADU. Spikes were replaced with the median value of the window, then the window was advanced one frame, and the process was repeated until the last frame was included in the window. MAD was employed to determine the variability within a window as it is a robust variability measure and does not increase substantially due to the very spikes we are trying to filter, unlike the standard deviation or variance.
Finally, we performed a mean-normalization to remove effects of readout laser intensity fluctuation, bleaching, etc., by multiplying frame 𝑗 by a factor 𝛽 = ⟨ 𝐼 ⁡ ( 𝑡 = 0 ) ⟩ 𝑥 , 𝑦 / ⟨ 𝐼 ⁡ ( 𝑡 𝑗 ) ⟩ 𝑥 , 𝑦 where ⟨ 𝑘 ⟩ 𝑥 denotes an average of 𝑘 taken over 𝑥 .
We calculated the temporal variance and average for each pixel during Cry2-activation in live cells. In order to arrive at a metric which is theoretically independent of baseline signal magnitude, and therefore expression levels, we normalized the temporal variance by the mean. This is a convenient normalization for data influenced by shot noise because the variance of a Poisson process is equal to its mean. The clustering metric is given by 𝐶 ⁡ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 = ⟨ 𝑉 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑡 ⁡ [ 𝐶 𝑥 , 𝑦 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ] ⟨ 𝐶 𝑥 , 𝑦 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⟩ 𝑡 ⟩ 𝑥 , 𝑦 ∈ 𝑚 where 𝐶 𝑖 , 𝑗 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) is the corrected intensity at pixel x,y as a function of time, and m denotes the set of x,y pixels within a mask. An intermediary variance-over-mean image can be generated where individual clusters are visible. Using fluorescence intensity as a proxy for concentration, the clustering metric can be plotted against baseline intensity so that comparisons between constructs may be made ( Figures S2 A and S2C).
The clustering metric for a homogeneous Poisson process should be unity, however our camera data is not only subject to shot noise, but also read noise and noise due to the stochastic nature of electron multiplication ( Robbins and Hadwen, 2003 75. Robbins, M.S. ∙ Hadwen, B.J. The noise performance of electron multiplying charge-coupled devices IEEE Trans. Electron Dev. 2003; 50 :1227-1232 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). A more complete camera noise model may be necessary for comparison of results from different microscopes or camera settings.
While the clustering metric allows for comparison between the degree of clustering for individual cells, the expression efficiency and/or sampling varies between constructs, complicating statistical analysis between them. To remove the influence of data which did not experience significant clustering, we performed a Mann-Whitney U test between the clustering metric distribution of the negative control (mCherry-Cry2) and each individual clustering metric from other distributions, classifying cells which reject the null hypothesis with 𝛼 = 0 . 2 as cells which experience clustering. We then calculated the median clustering metric for a construct using only its cluster-positive cells and used that to compute differences in clustering magnitude.
STED and confocal image stacks of Coilin and SMN were segmented using a linear-bin Otsu threshold applied to the entire volume of each channel after smoothing by a Gaussian filter (sigma of 40 nm in x and y, 43.87 nm in z). The STED mask in both colors was taken to be the intersection of the smoothed and thresholded STED channels and their paired confocal channel masks. The original STED images were then analyzed using these masks. The intensity-weighted and masked center of mass was calculated in 3D for both Coilin and SMN, and the Euclidean distance separation calculated as the offset. To calculate the fractional intensity overlap, the intersection of Coilin and SMN masks were taken, and the intensity in this region was summed over both channels and divided by the combined sum of the intensity in each of the individual channels within their own mask.
Images were segmented to identify nuclei using Hoechst stain and condensates were identified from SMN immunofluorescence via otsu thresholding and object identification in CellProfiler. Nuclei masks were shrunken by three pixels in all directions to avoid confounding cytoplasmic signal and condensates were then matched to their corresponding nuclei. Cells were not filtered out by expression before performing analysis. Condensates were counted and analyzed for size by computing the mean radius of each. The expression level was assessed by expanding nuclear masks out to the cell periphery using a secondary Otsu threshold on SMN signal and then integrating signal over the whole-cell mask. To mitigate multiple comparison problems, SMN condensate number and size distributions were first analyzed for significant variation using the Kruskal-Wallace H test and then followed by pairwise post hoc analysis using Dunn’s test, where appropriate.
Tdrd3 Tud samples were scored for the percentage of cells with cytoplasmic condensates out of those with nuclear condensates. From Snd1 Tud samples, one nucleus with condensates was chosen at random from each image collected per condition and a line trace was drawn across the nuclear diameter. The fifth and ninety-fifth percentile of values in each scan were computed and a relative dynamic range was computed by normalizing the difference between these percentiles by the mean intensity of the scan. The Mann-Whitney U test was used as a non-parametric test of statistical significance between samples.
Images were prepared for figures and FRAP calculations were done using ImageJ (FIJI) version 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52p ( Schindelin et al., 2012 79. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ...

All images within a figure are contrast matched, and an intensity grayscale or color bar is given for reference where applicable. All live cell images are micrographs from single z-slice movies except where otherwise noted. Images and quantification comparisons are only made between samples taken with identical microscope calibrations. Confocal images of fixed samples are maximum intensity projections of z stacks. The two-dimensional rendering of isoSTED data was generated using Imspector and the three-dimensional renderings were generated with Imaris.
