Title: Neuronal Inactivity Co-opts LTP Machinery to Drive Potassium Channel Splicing and Homeostatic Spike Widening


Abstract: Summary

Homeostasis of neural firing properties is important in stabilizing neuronal circuitry, but how such plasticity might depend on alternative splicing is not known. Here we report that chronic inactivity homeostatically increases action potential duration by changing alternative splicing of BK channels; this requires nuclear export of the splicing factor Nova-2. Inactivity and Nova-2 relocation were connected by a novel synapto-nuclear signaling pathway that surprisingly invoked mechanisms akin to Hebbian plasticity: Ca 2+ -permeable AMPA receptor upregulation, L-type Ca 2+ channel activation, enhanced spine Ca 2+ transients, nuclear translocation of a CaM shuttle, and nuclear CaMKIV activation. These findings not only uncover commonalities between homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity but also connect homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. The signaling cascade provides a full-loop mechanism for a classic autoregulatory feedback loop proposed ‚àº25 years ago. Each element of the loop has been implicated previously in neuropsychiatric disease.

Section: Introduction

Neurons use multiple forms of plasticity to allow circuits to be flexible yet stable: Hebbian plasticity (positive feedback to strengthen already active circuit elements, as in long-term potentiation [LTP]) and homeostatic plasticity (negative feedback to boost neuronal elements deprived of activity or depress those undergoing hyperactivity). Homeostatic plasticity helps keep neuronal circuits away from extremes of silence or runaway excitation ( Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004 112. Turrigiano, G.G. ‚àô Nelson, S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5 :97-107 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and occurs at multiple levels of synapses, neurons, and circuits ( Desai et al., 1999; Kim and Tsien, 2008; O‚ÄôLeary et al., 2014; Turrigiano, 2008 15.

In contrast, alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNA has received little attention as a basis of neuronal homeostasis. This is surprising because AS is a critical intermediary between gene transcription and translation and engenders the enormous complexity of neuronal proteomes. By regulating exon inclusion, AS diversifies synaptic components, ion channels, and other key neuronal proteins ( Furlanis and Scheiffele, 2018; Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010; Vuong et al., 2016 24.

We asked whether AS supports homeostatic responses induced by long-term inactivity. Would this be converse to neuronal responses to hyperactivity ( Ding et al., 2017; Iijima et al., 2011; Li et al., 2007; Mauger et al., 2016; Xie and Black, 2001 16.

In turn, how does AS affect neuronal activity? Answering these questions would delineate a classic homeostatic feedback loop ùõ• F i r i n g ‚Üí ùõ• ‚Å¢ C a 2 + ‚Å¢ s i g n a l i n g ‚Üë ‚Üì ùõ• C e l l u l a r p r o t e i n s ‚Üê ùõ• G e n e e x p r e s s i o n proposed more than 25 year ago at Brandeis ( LeMasson et al., 1993; Marder et al., 1996; Siegel et al., 1994 55.

This scheme embodies the feedback principles of neuronal homeostasis but has never been worked out in a full loop for any aspect of neuronal function. We focused on action potential duration (APD), fundamental in tuning neurons, synapses, and circuits. Even small changes in APD greatly affect Ca 2+ influx ( Borst and Sakmann, 1998; Geiger and Jonas, 2000; Llin√°s et al., 1982 6. Borst, J.G. ‚àô Sakmann, B.

Neurosci. 1997; 17 :3425-3435 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). APD is generally prolonged by inactivity ( Kim and Tsien, 2008; Trasande and Ramirez, 2007 43. Kim, J. ‚àô Tsien, R.W.

Neurophysiol. 2007; 24 :154-164 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), an appropriate response to homeostatically restore Ca 2+ entry, but remarkably little is known about underlying mechanisms.
Here we report that inactivity-induced homeostatic regulation of APD in excitatory neurons is controlled by AS of the large-conductance Ca 2+ -activated potassium channel (BK channel). We deciphered the underlying signaling mechanism: a specific change in BK AS driven by a novel cascade involving Ca 2+ -permeable glutamate receptors, voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, calcium/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase kinase Œ≤ (Œ≤CaMKK), CaM kinase IV (CaMKIV), and the splicing factor Nova-2. We find that complete silencing of an excitatory neuron triggers signaling similar to that activated during direct depolarization. Strikingly, each signaling player is encoded by a gene implicated previously in neuropsychiatric disease.

Section: Results

Although homeostasis of action potential (AP) frequency is well studied ( Desai et al., 1999; Lee and Chung, 2014; Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008 15. Desai, N.S. ‚àô Rutherford, L.C. ‚àô Turrigiano, G.G. Plasticity in the intrinsic excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2 :515-520 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Lee, K.Y. ‚àô Chung, H.J. NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels mediate the expression of bidirectional homeostatic intrinsic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons Neuroscience. 2014; 277 :610-623 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Maffei, A. ‚àô Turrigiano, G.G. Multiple modes of network homeostasis in visual cortical layer 2/3 J. Neurosci. 2008; 28 :4377-4384 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ), how APD is regulated remains mysterious. This distinction is critical because spike width regulates neuronal excitability, Ca 2+ influx, and neurotransmission and is governed by its own set of ion channels operating in parallel with channels controlling spike frequency ( Kimm et al., 2015 45. Kimm, T. ‚àô Khaliq, Z.M. ‚àô Bean, B.P. Differential regulation of action potential shape and burst-frequency firing by BK and Kv2 channels in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :16404-16417 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To examine homeostasis of APD, we blocked spiking of cultured cortical neurons by chronic (24- or 48-h) sodium channel blockade with tetrodotoxin (TTX) and examined APD after TTX removal. Chronically silenced neurons had a significantly longer APD than mock-treated controls ( Figures 1 A and S1 ), and AP-induced Ca 2+ transients were elevated 1.5- to 2-fold in amplitude and duration ( Figure 1 B), as expected from APD-dependent prolongation of Ca 2+ channel activation ( Bischofberger et al., 2002 3. Bischofberger, J. ‚àô Geiger, J.R. ‚àô Jonas, P. Timing and efficacy of Ca 2+ channel activation in hippocampal mossy fiber boutons J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 :10593-10602 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, chronic inactivity drove compensatory increases in APD and Ca 2+ entry as negative feedback autoregulation.
The slowing of repolarization that drove APD prolongation was associated with blunted afterhyperpolarization (AHP) ( Figure 1 A). Both changes would ensue if potassium channel activity was reduced. We considered the BK channel because it regulates APD and AHP ( Hu et al., 2001; Lee and Cui, 2010; Sausbier et al., 2004; Shao et al., 1999 35. Hu, H. ‚àô Shao, L.R. ‚àô Chavoshy, S. ...

Shao, L.R. ‚àô Halvorsrud, R. ‚àô Borg-Graham, L. ... The role of BK-type Ca 2+ -dependent K + channels in spike broadening during repetitive firing in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells J. Physiol. 1999; 521 :135-146 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, inhibiting BK channels with a specific blocker, iberiotoxin (IbTx), lengthened AP half-width ( Figures 1 C and 1D). To test whether BK channels are involved in inactivity-induced APD widening, we applied IbTx to TTX-silenced cortical cultures (48 h) just before AP recording. Strikingly, IbTx did not further widen APs ( Figures 1 C and 1D); the effect of inactivity largely occluded IbTx‚Äôs effect on APD. Evidently, neuronal silencing and IbTx converge on a common pathway‚Äîinhibiting BK activity in widening the AP.
Chronic inactivity might inhibit BK channels via gene expression and membrane trafficking. However, decreases in transcription, mRNA translation, or protein trafficking were ruled out by measurements of BK mRNA, total protein, and surface membrane expression ( Figures S2 A‚ÄìS2D). BK channels also undergo AS, with profound effects on activity ( Fodor and Aldrich, 2009; Shelley et al., 2013; Shipston and Tian, 2016; Xie and McCobb, 1998; Zarei et al., 2001 23.

A novel MaxiK splice variant exhibits dominant-negative properties for surface expression J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :16232-16239 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assessed the expression of exons predicted to undergo splicing (X1‚ÄìX6; Figure 1 E) via RT-PCR ( Pietrzykowski et al., 2008 86. Pietrzykowski, A.Z. ‚àô Friesen, R.M. ‚àô Martin, G.E. ... Posttranscriptional regulation of BK channel splice variant stability by miR-9 underlies neuroadaptation to alcohol Neuron. 2008; 59 :274-287 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). In cultured cortical neurons, BK underwent AS in X3, X4, and X6 but not in X1, X2, and X5 ( Figures 1 F and S3 A). Notably, only X6 (called E29 hereafter) splicing decreased after chronic TTX treatment ( Figures 1 F); AS of other exons remained unchanged ( Figure S3 B), narrowing our search for the basis of BK modulation.
We also tested the effect of enhanced activity by depolarization with K + -rich culture media (20, 40, and 60 mM K + ; Figure S3 C). Surprisingly, chronic depolarization decreased E29 exon inclusion ( Figures 1 G and S3 D); the magnitude of shift in AS varied with strength and duration of depolarization ( Figure S3 D), but always in the same direction as chronic inactivity. We return later to resolve the paradox of how chronic silencing and depolarization produce similar changes in BK AS.
Depolarization- or seizure-induced changes in AS involve activation of CaM-dependent kinases ( Xie and Black, 2001 123. Xie, J. ‚àô Black, D.L. A CaMK IV responsive RNA element mediates depolarization-induced alternative splicing of ion channels Nature. 2001; 410 :936-939 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, little is known about AS induced by inactivity, leading us to focus on its functional effect and underlying mechanisms.
E29 encodes 27 amino acids strategically located within the regulator of K + conductance (RCK) domain, near the Ca 2+ bowl, one of the Ca 2+ binding sites promoting BK activation ( Figure 1 E). E29 inclusion affects BK responses to Ca 2+ ( Ha et al., 2000 28. Ha, T.S. ‚àô Jeong, S.Y. ‚àô Cho, S.W. ... Functional characteristics of two BK Ca channel variants differentially expressed in rat brain tissues Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267 :910-918 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) and to alcohol-induced microRNAs (miRNAs) ( Pietrzykowski et al., 2008 86. Pietrzykowski, A.Z. ‚àô Friesen, R.M. ‚àô Martin, G.E. ... Posttranscriptional regulation of BK channel splice variant stability by miR-9 underlies neuroadaptation to alcohol Neuron. 2008; 59 :274-287 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). We expressed BK channels in HEK293 cells to find out whether E29 inclusion influences BK currents. BK currents were smaller with ŒîE29 than with E29 ( Figures 1 H and 1I), whereas the membrane expression level was no different ( Figures S2 E‚ÄìS2G). Thus, the reduction of E29 inclusion after TTX treatment likely contributes to the dampening of BK outward current.
We returned to cultured cortical neurons to test directly whether a drop in E29 inclusion leads to APD prolongation. Upon overexpression of the ŒîE29 BK construct, APD was longer, in line with lower BK conductance, relative to that observed for its E29 counterpart. Furthermore, action potentials of E29-expressing neurons failed to broaden with chronic silencing. Likewise, the already widened AP of ŒîE29-expressing showed no further prolongation ( Figures 1 J and 1K). Thus, inclusion or exclusion of E29 in overexpressed channels overrides the regulation engaged by chronic inactivity, suggesting that such regulation involves E29 splicing. Clinching this calls for understanding how the splicing is controlled.
AS of BK channels has been intensely studied, but how E29 inclusion is controlled remains unknown. Generally, splicing regulatory factors favor exon inclusion when binding to downstream introns but inhibit it when binding to upstream introns or the exon itself ( Black, 2003; Ule et al., 2006 5. Black, D.L. Mechanisms of alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72 :291-336 Crossref Scopus (1837) PubMed Google Scholar 114. Ule, J. ‚àô Stefani, G. ‚àô Mele, A. ... An RNA map predicting Nova-dependent splicing regulation Nature. 2006; 444 :580-586 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our bioinformatics analysis of the intronic sequence past E29 revealed YCAY (Y=C/U) clusters ( Figure 2 A), consensus sequences for binding of Nova proteins, a well-studied class of neuron-specific RNA-binding proteins that regulate AS of neuronal proteins ( Buckanovich and Darnell, 1997; Ule et al., 2005 8. Buckanovich, R.J. ‚àô Darnell, R.B. The neuronal RNA binding protein Nova-1 recognizes specific RNA targets in vitro and in vivo Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17 :3194-3201 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar 113. Ule, J. ‚àô Ule, A. ‚àô Spencer, J. ... Nova regulates brain-specific splicing to shape the synapse Nat. Genet. 2005; 37 :844-852 Crossref Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice lacking Nova-2, the predominant isoform in the neocortex ( Yang et al., 1998 126. Yang, Y.Y. ‚àô Yin, G.L. ‚àô Darnell, R.B. The neuronal RNA-binding protein Nova-2 is implicated as the autoantigen targeted in POMA patients with dementia Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :13254-13259 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), are deficient in E29 inclusion ( Ule et al., 2005 113. Ule, J. ‚àô Ule, A. ‚àô Spencer, J. ... Nova regulates brain-specific splicing to shape the synapse Nat. Genet. 2005; 37 :844-852 Crossref Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To see whether E29 splicing is directly regulated by Nova-2, we tested whether Nova-2 binds to synthetic RNA oligonucleotides spanning the putative binding region in the downstream intron (probe A1; Figure 2 A). Pull-down assays showed that probe A1 binds efficiently to endogenous Nova-2 from mouse cortical lysates. In contrast, no binding to Nova-2 was detected with a probe with mutations in putative Nova-2-binding (YCAY) sites (probe A2) or a control probe spanning a 35-bp intronic stretch upstream of A1 without YCAY motifs (probe B; Figures 2 A and 2B). We asked whether Nova-2 also bound to the intron downstream of E29 in vivo , subjecting cortical lysates to RNA immunoprecipitation (IP) with Nova-2 antibodies and assaying with RT-PCR using primers flanking the YCAY sites. RT-PCR product was detected following IP with Nova-2 antibodies but not with control immunoglobulin G (IgG) ( Figure 2 C). No product from the Nova-2 immunoprecipitate was detected without reverse transcriptase, excluding an effect of genomic DNA contamination ( Figure 2 C). Thus, in vivo and in vitro experiments show that Nova-2 binds directly to the YCAY sites in the intron downstream of E29.
Testing the necessity of Nova-2 for E29 inclusion, we knocked down Nova-2 in cultured cortical neurons using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that targeted its coding sequence (CDS), or its untranslated region (UTR) ( Figure S4 A); the UTR-directed shRNA spared an exogenous Nova-2 construct lacking the UTR (Nova-2(R); Figure S4 B). E29 inclusion was sharply reduced by lentiviral delivery of UTR-targeting shRNA but not of scrambled shRNA and not of exogenous Nova-2(R) ( Figure 2 D). This match to the pattern of Nova-2 knockdown and rescue ( Figure S4 B) suggested that Nova-2 is necessary for the AS event.
Because Nova-2 acts outside of the nucleus ( Racca et al., 2010 88. Racca, C. ‚àô Gardiol, A. ‚àô Eom, T. ... The Neuronal Splicing Factor Nova Co-Localizes with Target RNAs in the Dendrite Front. Neural Circuits. 2010; 4 :5 PubMed Google Scholar ), not just within it, we assessed the effect of cellular locale by comparing the effects of Nova-2 lacking its nuclear localization signal (ŒîNLS) and with the NLS intact (wild type [WT]). Although WT Nova-2 was concentrated in the nucleus, ŒîNLS-Nova-2 was mainly cytoplasmic ( Figure 2 E). We verified that Nova-2 directly regulates E29 inclusion using a splice reporter ( Stoilov et al., 2008 106. Stoilov, P. ‚àô Lin, C.H. ‚àô Damoiseaux, R. ...

USA. 2008; 105 :11218-11223 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ) containing E29 and partial flanking intron sequences ( Figure 2 F) in HEK293 cells (largely lacking endogenous Nova-2). In controls, E29 inclusion was knocked down by Nova-2 shRNA and rescued by Nova2(R) ( Figure S4 C). Critically, ŒîNLS-Nova-2 largely failed to induce E29 inclusion ( Figures 2 F and S4 C), supporting the importance of nuclear localization.
To confirm in neurons that Nova-2 is critical for chronic inactivity-induced E29 reduction, we assayed the effects of chronic TTX after knockdown of Nova-2 ( Figure 2 G). Although scrambled lentiviral shRNA spared the reduction of E29 inclusion following 48-h TTX treatment, knockdown of Nova-2 mimicked and occluded the effect of chronic inactivity on E29 inclusion ( Figure 2 G). These experiments showed that Nova-2 binds directly to the intron downstream of E29 and is necessary and sufficient for regulation of E29 inclusion by inactivity.
This sets up the question of how Nova-2 effectiveness is linked to chronic inactivity. Because Nova-2 must be in the nucleus to control splicing, its cellular relocalization is a potential control point. We assessed Nova-2 localization in cultured cortical neurons after 48-h treatment with TTX. In TTX-treated neurons, Nova-2 nuclear intensity was lower than control cells, whereas cytosolic Nova-2 intensity increased ( Figure 3 A), yielding a relative 2-fold drop in the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio ( Figure 3 B, left). We verified these immunocytochemical findings by nuclear fractionation and immunoblot analysis ( Figure 3 C). After TTX exposure, nuclear Nova-2 levels fell, cytoplasmic Nova-2 rose, and total Nova-2 expression remained unchanged ( Figures 3 C and 3D), indicating that Nova-2 translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol upon silencing of cultured neurons. A similar shift in the nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio was seen upon chronic depolarization ( Figure 3 B, right); thus, the paradoxically similar regulation of E29 inclusion arises at or before Nova-2 relocation.
We next asked whether silencing neocortical neurons in vivo caused similar changes as in dissociated cultures. Tonic inputs from the thalamus to the neocortex, which excite ongoing activity of cortical neurons, were chronically eliminated in mice by expressing tetanus toxin light chain (TeTox) in Olig3-positive thalamic neurons ( Figure 3 E). Nova localization was assayed in cortical neurons innervated by thalamic inputs. Nova was largely nuclear in Olig3 Cre (control) mice but excluded from the nucleus in Olig3 Cre; TeToxf/+mice ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Chronic removal of thalamic input led to Nova translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol of cortical neurons.
Inactivity-induced Nova-2 translocation was also observed with a monocular deprivation (MD) paradigm ( Wiesel and Hubel, 1963 121. Wiesel, T.N. ‚àô Hubel, D.H. Effects of visual deprivation on morphology and physiology of cells in the cats lateral geniculate body J. Neurophysiol. 1963; 26 :978-993 Crossref Scopus (797) PubMed Google Scholar ). A lid suture was applied in juvenile mice for 5 days during the critical period of visual development (post-natal days 26‚Äì31) ( Figure 3 H), and subcellular localization of Nova-2 in monocular V1 was assayed by immunostaining. The nuclear intensity of Nova-2 in the deprived hemisphere (contralateral to the closed eye) was less than in the non-deprived hemisphere (ipsilateral); opposite differences were seen in cytoplasmic intensity ( Figures 3 I and 3J). Thus, MD-induced inactivity also induced in vivo Nova-2 translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol. Strikingly, MD also reduced E29 inclusion and increased APD in the vision-deprived hemisphere compared with its non-deprived counterpart ( Figures 3 K‚Äì3N). Thus, chronic inactivity in vivo leads to nucleus-to-cytosol Nova-2 redistribution, reduction of E29 inclusion, and increased APD.
While cellular control mechanisms of Nova-2 localization have not been reported, we considered scenarios including regulation by phosphorylation. CaMKIV was a likely candidate as a robust protein kinase, highly concentrated within the nucleus ( Bito et al., 1996; Nakamura et al., 1995 4. Bito, H. ‚àô Deisseroth, K. ‚àô Tsien, R.W.

An immunohistochemical study of Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV in the rat central nervous system: light and electron microscopic observations Neuroscience. 1995; 68 :181-194 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ); CaMKIV regulates other splicing factors, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L) ( Liu et al., 2012 63. Liu, G. ‚àô Razanau, A. ‚àô Hai, Y. ... A conserved serine of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L) mediates depolarization-regulated alternative splicing of potassium channels J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :22709-22716 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and supports homeostatic adjustments ( Ibata et al., 2008 36. Ibata, K. ‚àô Sun, Q. ‚àô Turrigiano, G.G. Rapid synaptic scaling induced by changes in postsynaptic firing Neuron. 2008; 57 :819-826 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test for involvement of CaMKIV, we looked at its status in the nucleus after chronic inactivity, monitoring phosphorylation on Thr196, its dominant activation site ( Selbert et al., 1995; Tokumitsu and Soderling, 1996 97. Selbert, M.A. ‚àô Anderson, K.A. ‚àô Huang, Q.H. ... Phosphorylation and activation of Ca( 2+ )-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV by Ca( 2+ )-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ia kinase.

Requirements for calcium and calmodulin in the calmodulin kinase activation cascade J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :5617-5622 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thr196 phosphorylation was higher in the nucleus of TTX-treated neurons relative to the control ( Figure 4 A), resulting in a 1.5-fold higher nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio ( Figure 4 B). Elevated activation of nuclear CaMKIV was also seen in vivo upon immunoblot analysis of samples from cortical V1, comparing lysates from monocularly deprived and non-deprived hemispheres ( Figure 4 C).
Is mimicking CaMKIV activation sufficient to induce Nova-2 translocation? To test this, we expressed constitutively activated CaMKIV (CA-CaMKIV) ( Cruzalegui and Means, 1993 12. Cruzalegui, F.H. ‚àô Means, A.R. Biochemical characterization of the multifunctional Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV expressed in insect cells J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 :26171-26178 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) and assayed Nova-2 localization. In vector control-transfected neurons, Nova-2 was predominantly located in the nucleus ( Figure 4 D, top row). In contrast, in CA-CaMKIV-transfected neurons, Nova-2 nuclear intensity was lower, and cytoplasmic intensity was higher ( Figure 4 D, second row), causing a significant drop in nuclear/cytoplasmic (nuc/cyt) ratio ( Figure 4 E). Evidently, activation of CaMKIV is sufficient to drive Nova-2 translocation. Continuous activation of CaMKIV requires its binding to Ca 2+ /CaM. Accordingly, we overexpressed a nucleus-localized Ca 2+ /CaM trap, CaMBP4(nuc) ( Cohen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 1995 11. Cohen, S.M. ‚àô Ma, H. ‚àô Kuchibhotla, K.V. ... Excitation-transcription coupling in parvalbumin-positive interneurons employs a novel CaM kinase-dependent pathway distinct from excitatory neurons Neuron. 2016; 90 :292-307 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar 116. Wang, J. ‚àô Campos, B. ‚àô Jamieson, Jr., G.A. ... Functional elimination of calmodulin within the nucleus by targeted expression of an inhibitor peptide J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 :30245-30248 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), before examining Nova-2 location. This intervention abolished the chronic inactivity-induced nuclear export of Nova-2 ( Figures 4 D, fourth row, and 4 E), supporting the idea that Nova-2 translocation is regulated by activated CaMKIV. These experiments indicate that CaMKIV activation is sufficient and necessary to induce Nova-2 translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol.
Both Nova-2 and CaMKIV are mostly located in the nucleus ( Figure 5 A), but whether they directly interact is unknown. To explore this, we co-expressed constructs encoding FLAG-tagged Nova-2 and GFP-tagged CaMKIV in HEK293 cells. CoIP and western blotting with anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibodies were performed on protein lysates to detect protein-protein interaction. FLAG-tagged Nova-2 was found with IP using anti-GFP antibody; GFP-tagged CaMKIV was seen upon IP with anti-FLAG antibody ( Figure 5 B). No reciprocal interaction was detected upon IP of lysates of mock-transfected cells or when they were expressed individually ( Figure 5 B).
The interaction was also evident even at endogenous levels of protein expression in neurons. Nova-2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-CaMKIV antibody; CaMKIV was brought down with anti-Nova-2 antibody, but no binding interactions were seen with IgG controls ( Figure 5 C). These results indicate that Nova-2 and CaMKIV engage in protein-protein interaction, studied as exogenous or endogenous proteins.
To find out whether CaMKIV phosphorylates Nova-2, we co-expressed CA-CaMKIV (or GFP as a control) with FLAG-tagged Nova-2 in HEK293 cells and probed Nova-2 phosphorylation with mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS]) ( Figures S5 A‚ÄìS5D and 5 D5G). Compared with the control, CA-CaMKIV drove Nova-2 phosphorylation at three sites: serine 25 (site 1), threonine 27 (site 2), and serine 194 (site 3). Sites 1 and 2 lie within or next to the NLS in Nova-2, predictive of influence on nuclear localization ( Harreman et al., 2004 30. Harreman, M.T. ‚àô Kline, T.M. ‚àô Milford, H.G. ... Regulation of nuclear import by phosphorylation adjacent to nuclear localization signals J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :20613-20621 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ); site 3 resides in the KH2 domain, one of the RNA binding domains ( Yang et al., 1998 126. Yang, Y.Y. ‚àô Yin, G.L. ‚àô Darnell, R.B. The neuronal RNA-binding protein Nova-2 is implicated as the autoantigen targeted in POMA patients with dementia Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :13254-13259 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether phosphorylation affects Nova-2 location in cultured neurons, we probed the distribution of FLAG-tagged Nova-2 constructs with the sites mutated to glutamic acid (E) to mimic the negative charge phosphorylation confers or to alanine (A) to prevent phosphorylation. In contrast to the mostly nuclear positioning of WT Nova-2, Nova-2 with phosphomimetic mutations at sites 1 and 2 (1E2E) was mostly cytoplasmic ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Single mutations (1E or 2E) reduced Nova-2 nuclear localization, even when the other site was mutated to alanine (1E2A or 1A2E) ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Conversely, Nova-2 with single or double mutations to alanine (2A and 1A2A) was predominantly nuclear, like the WT ( Figures 5 H and 5I). In contrast, glutamate mutations at site 3 had no effect on Nova-2 localization ( Figures 5 H and 5I) or on Nova-2 binding to RNA ( Figure S5 E). These results showed that active CaMKIV reduces Nova-2 nuclear localization by phosphorylating sites 1 and 2 (S25, T27).
To test whether CaMKIV phosphorylation of Nova-2 controlled its ability to regulate E29 splicing, we co-expressed the 1E2E double mutant Nova-2 with the E29 splicing reporter in HEK293 cells. Unlike WT Nova-2, the 1E2E variant was unable to induce E29 inclusion, like Nova-2 lacking its NLS (ŒîNLS; Figure 5 J). Evidently, CaMKIV binds to Nova-2 in the nucleus, primed to phosphorylate serine 25 and threonine 27 sites near the NLS of Nova-2; the resulting Nova-2 nuclear exit prevents its action in splicing, reducing exon 29 inclusion.
How does chronic elimination of AP firing lead to activation of CaMKIV and nuclear exit of Nova-2? Activity blockade with TTX abolishes evoked vesicle release but spares spontaneous, AP-independent vesicle release. We asked whether spontaneous synaptic transmission might be sufficient to activate signaling to CaMKIV activation and Nova-2 translocation.
To test this, we monitored the membrane potential in dendritic spines of cortical neurons using the genetically encoded voltage indicator ASAP1 ( St-Pierre et al., 2014 104. St-Pierre, F. ‚àô Marshall, J.D. ‚àô Yang, Y. ... High-fidelity optical reporting of neuronal electrical activity with an ultrafast fluorescent voltage sensor Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :884-889 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). ASAP1 fluorescence was seen in the plasma membrane of somata, dendritic shafts, and spines ( Figure 6 A). Decreases in ASAP1 fluorescence were linearly related to membrane depolarizations ( St-Pierre et al., 2014 104. St-Pierre, F. ‚àô Marshall, J.D. ‚àô Yang, Y. ... High-fidelity optical reporting of neuronal electrical activity with an ultrafast fluorescent voltage sensor Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :884-889 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ) imposed by K + -rich external solution ( Figure 6 B, gray symbols). In cortical cultures acutely exposed to TTX, dendritic spines exhibited dips in relative fluorescence intensity (ŒîF/F), reflecting spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) ( Figure 6 C, green exemplar trace, and 6 B, pooled data). After chronic TTX, spontaneous spine depolarizations grew by ‚àº10 mV ( Figure 6 C, red trace), exceeding depolarization attained with 20 mM K + ( Figure 6 B, pooled data), sufficient to recruit L-type Ca 2+ channel- and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated Ca 2+ influx ( Helton et al., 2005; Mayer et al., 1984; Nowak et al., 1984 32. Helton, T.D. ‚àô Xu, W. ‚àô Lipscombe, D. Neuronal L-type calcium channels open quickly and are inhibited slowly J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :10247-10251 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 74. Mayer, M.L. ‚àô Westbrook, G.L. ‚àô Guthrie, P.B. Voltage-dependent block by Mg 2+ of NMDA responses in spinal cord neurones Nature. 1984; 309 :261-263 Crossref Scopus (2120) PubMed Google Scholar 78. Nowak, L. ‚àô Bregestovski, P. ‚àô Ascher, P. ... Magnesium gates glutamate-activated channels in mouse central neurones Nature. 1984; 307 :462-465 Crossref Scopus (2993) PubMed Google Scholar ). For comparison, even larger ŒîF/F transients were observed in dendritic spines of control neurons during backpropagating dendritic APs (bAPs) or somatic action potentials recorded without TTX ( Figures 6 C, blue and violet exemplar traces, and 6 B, pooled data).
To study spontaneous Ca 2+ transients in dendritic spines, we expressed the fluorescent Ca 2+ indicator GCaMP6s ( Figures 6 D‚Äì6G). Although the soma of cortical neurons was totally silent in the presence of TTX ( Figures S6 A and S6B), dendritic spines remained active despite spike blockade ( Figures 6 D‚Äì6G and S6 C). More spines were active in neurons chronically treated with TTX than in controls ( Figure 6 H). Likewise, the Ca 2+ transients were taller, broader, and larger in area ( Figures 6 I‚Äì6K), whereas fluorescent punctum size and event frequency per punctum were no different ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Thus, chronic blockade of APs enhances spontaneous Ca 2+ transients in spines, in line with optical voltage recordings.
We characterized the elevated synaptic Ca 2+ transients, mindful of increases in Ca 2+ -permeable, GluA1-containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs) following activity blockade ( Kim and Ziff, 2014; Thiagarajan et al., 2005 44. Kim, S. ‚àô Ziff, E.B. Calcineurin mediates synaptic scaling via synaptic trafficking of Ca 2+ -permeable AMPA receptors PLoS Biol. 2014; 12 :e1001900 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar 108. Thiagarajan, T.C. ‚àô Lindskog, M. ‚àô Tsien, R.W. Adaptation to synaptic inactivity in hippocampal neurons Neuron. 2005; 47 :725-737 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). Live-labeled surface GluA1 increased in neurons that had undergone chronic inactivity ( Figures S6 F and S6G). Elevated surface GluA1 contributed to the enlarged Ca 2+ transient, indicated by a sharp drop in synaptic Ca 2+ transients upon acute exposure to the GluA1 antagonist philanthotoxin (PhTx) ( Figure 6 L). Importantly, PhTx completely blocked chronic inactivity-induced AP prolongation ( Figures 6 M and 6N), indicating that GluA1 activation was critical for homeostatic regulation of APD.
Following chronic inactivity, elevated Ca 2+ transients were also inhibited by blockade of NMDAR with ((2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; (2R)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) APV and depletion of internal Ca 2+ stores with thapsigargin ( Figure 6 L). This aligns with AMPAR activation recruiting Ca 2+ delivery via NMDAR and intracellular Ca 2+ stores ( Emptage et al., 1999 21. Emptage, N. ‚àô Bliss, T.V. ‚àô Fine, A. Single synaptic events evoke NMDA receptor-mediated release of calcium from internal stores in hippocampal dendritic spines Neuron. 1999; 22 :115-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ). Voltage-dependent L-type Ca 2+ channels (Ca V 1) also contributed to spine Ca 2+ transients during chronic inactivity, as judged by partial reduction with nimodipine ( Figure 6 L). A glutamate-gated cation current would create a voltage drop across the spine neck resistance ( Harnett et al., 2012; Palmer and Stuart, 2009 29. Harnett, M.T. ‚àô Makara, J.K. ‚àô Spruston, N. ... Synaptic amplification by dendritic spines enhances input cooperativity Nature. 2012; 491 :599-602 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Palmer, L.M. ‚àô Stuart, G.J. Membrane potential changes in dendritic spines during action potentials and synaptic input J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :6897-6903 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), giving rise to directly measured depolarizations and Ca V 1- and NMDA-mediated Ca 2+ influx ( Figure 6 L).
We verified inactivity-induced engagement of Ca 2+ signaling by testing for activation of CaMKII and CaMKI in dendritic spines, which, respectively, undergo autophosphorylation or CaM kinase kinase (CaMKK)-mediated phosphorylation in response to local Ca 2+ signals ( Wayman et al., 2008 118. Wayman, G.A. ‚àô Lee, Y.S. ‚àô Tokumitsu, H. ... Calmodulin-kinases: modulators of neuronal development and plasticity Neuron. 2008; 59 :914-931 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using site-specific anti-phospho-Thr antibodies, we showed CaMKII Thr286 autophosphorylation and CaMKI Thr177/178 phosphorylation, respectively ( Figures S6 H‚ÄìS6K). Chronic inactivity augmented the intensity of both markers relative to the control ( Figures S6 H‚ÄìS6K), providing independent biochemical evidence that local Ca 2+ signaling in spines is enhanced by chronic inactivity.
Intensified minis and spine Ca 2+ signaling could link inactivity to nuclear AS. To find out whether this involves a classical Ca V 1-CaMKK-CaMKIV cascade, like that engaged by depolarization ( West et al., 2002 119. West, A.E. ‚àô Griffith, E.C. ‚àô Greenberg, M.E. Regulation of transcription factors by neuronal activity Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3 :921-931 Crossref Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ), we monitored phosphorylation of CaMKIV as a pivotal step. Inactivity induced elevation of phosphorylated CaMKIV (pCaMKIV) but not in the presence of nimodipine (a Ca V 1 blocker), KN93 (a CaMK inhibitor), or STO-609 (a CaMKK blocker). This pattern was consistent in western blots of nuclear extracts ( Figures 7 A and 7B) and in nuc/cyto ratios obtained by immunocytochemistry ( Figures S7 A and S7B). Nova-2 localization showed a reciprocal pattern ( Figures 7 C, 7D, S7 C, and S7D) which was mirrored by TTX-induced reduction on E29 inclusion ( Figures 7 E and 7F). These results supported a chain of signaling events emanating from spontaneously active spines whereby a Ca V 1-CaMKK-CaMKIV pathway drives reductions in nuclear Nova-2 and in E29 inclusion.
Activation of a Ca V 1-CaMKK-CaMKIV pathway by chronic inactivity appears surprising because it seemingly recapitulates effects of hyperactivity ( Deisseroth et al., 2003; Ma et al., 2014 13. Deisseroth, K. ‚àô Mermelstein, P.G. ‚àô Xia, H. ... Signaling from synapse to nucleus: the logic behind the mechanisms Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13 :354-365 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Ma, H. ‚àô Groth, R.D. ‚àô Cohen, S.M. ... Œ≥CaMKII shuttles Ca 2+ /CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression Cell. 2014; 159 :281-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we found that directly imposed depolarization caused similar effects as chronic TTX on Nova-2 translocation and BK E29 exclusion ( Figures S7 E and S7F), with the latter effect completely prevented by nimodipine or KN93 ( Figures 7 G, 7H, and S7 F). Thus, activation of Ca V 1 channels and CaMKs drives Nova-2 relocation and E29 splicing, irrespective of how the pathway is engaged.
A remaining question is how, without spiking, Ca V 1 activation at dendritic sites causes activation of CaMKIV in the nucleus. In excitation-transcription coupling (E-T coupling) following acute depolarization, signaling to nuclear CaMKIV involves translocation of Ca 2+ /calmodulin via different shuttle proteins: Œ≥CaMKII in cortical, hippocampal, and sympathetic neurons ( Ma et al., 2014 67. Ma, H. ‚àô Groth, R.D. ‚àô Cohen, S.M. ... Œ≥CaMKII shuttles Ca 2+ /CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression Cell. 2014; 159 :281-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Œ≥CaMKI in parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons ( Cohen et al., 2016 11. Cohen, S.M. ‚àô Ma, H. ‚àô Kuchibhotla, K.V. ... Excitation-transcription coupling in parvalbumin-positive interneurons employs a novel CaM kinase-dependent pathway distinct from excitatory neurons Neuron. 2016; 90 :292-307 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). In seeking a translocator for excitation-AS coupling, we looked for an increase in nuclear level paired with a drop in cytoplasmic level during chronic inactivity. This pattern was not evident for Œ±CaMKI, Œ≤CaMKI, Œ≥CaMKI, Œ¥CaMKI, Œ≥CaMKII, Œ±CaMKK, and CaM itself ( Figures 7 J, S7 G, and S7H). In contrast, levels of Œ≤CaMKK rose in the nucleus and fell in the cytosol; its nuc/cyto ratio increased by more than 50% ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Œ≤CaMKK can phosphorylate CaMKIV and is thus a plausible mediator of cytosol-to-nucleus signaling and nuclear CaMKIV activation. We probed Œ≤CaMKK‚Äôs involvement by shRNA knockdown. This completely blocked inactivity-induced reduction of E29 inclusion, whereas concomitantly expressing shRNA-resistant Œ≤CaMKK fully rescued it ( Figure 7 K and 7L). Thus, Œ≤CaMKK translocates to the nucleus and is necessary for chronic inactivity-induced E29 splicing.

Section: Discussion

We found an unexpected mechanism by which excitatory neurons modify their APs in responding homeostatically to chronic inactivity ( Figure 7 M). The adaptation arises from a well-defined change in splicing and is mediated by a novel signaling cascade that mobilizes Hebbian-type signaling, even in the absence of spikes. Remarkably, each element of this signaling pathway has been genetically implicated in neuropsychiatric disease (see below).
We found that splicing of BK channels is necessary and sufficient for inactivity-induced lengthening of APD. Under typical circumstances, regulatory changes in one repolarizing current (e.g., BK) would be offset by compensatory changes in others (e.g., K V 2) ( Kimm et al., 2015 45. Kimm, T. ‚àô Khaliq, Z.M. ‚àô Bean, B.P. Differential regulation of action potential shape and burst-frequency firing by BK and Kv2 channels in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :16404-16417 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, however, the key findings are null effects ( Figures 1 C, 1D, 1J, 1K, 6M, and 6 N); without changes in spike waveform, altered recruitment of other voltage-gated channels is not expected. Kimm et al. (2015) 45. Kimm, T. ‚àô Khaliq, Z.M. ‚àô Bean, B.P. Differential regulation of action potential shape and burst-frequency firing by BK and Kv2 channels in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :16404-16417 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar have further shown that blockade of BK channels with IbTx spares the current-frequency relationship. Thus, mechanisms other than BK regulation are expected and seen for homeostatic adjustments of firing frequency ( Lee and Chung, 2014; Lee et al., 2015 49. Lee, K.Y. ‚àô Chung, H.J.

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors mediate activity-dependent down-regulation of potassium channel genes during the expression of homeostatic intrinsic plasticity Mol. Brain. 2015; 8 :4 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). For APD, we cannot exclude ancillary changes enabled by E29 inclusion, such as BK channel phosphorylation or modified auxiliary subunits. However, the brain-dominant BK auxiliary subunit Œ≤4 is not significantly altered by TTX treatment ( Lee et al., 2015 53. Lee, K.Y. ‚àô Royston, S.E. ‚àô Vest, M.O. ... N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors mediate activity-dependent down-regulation of potassium channel genes during the expression of homeostatic intrinsic plasticity Mol. Brain. 2015; 8 :4 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Elegant work shows how AS can be regulated by depolarization or activity elevation ( Ding et al., 2017; Iijima et al., 2011; Mauger et al., 2016; Xie and Black, 2001 16.

Xie, J. ‚àô Black, D.L. A CaMK IV responsive RNA element mediates depolarization-induced alternative splicing of ion channels Nature. 2001; 410 :936-939 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we show that AS is also controlled by chronic inactivity and dominates homeostatic regulation of AP shape. Strikingly, chronic inactivity-induced AS of BK, although homeostatic in outcome, relies on Ca V 1-CaMKK-CaMKIV signaling, like acute depolarization-induced splicing. Activation of Ca 2+ signaling by silencing neuronal spiking is counterintuitive; the expectation is that Ca 2+ entry would be dampened ( Bridi et al., 2018 7. Bridi, M.C.D. ‚àô de Pasquale, R. ‚àô Lantz, C.L. ... Two distinct mechanisms for experience-dependent homeostasis Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :843-850 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We resolved the paradox by optically tracking transient depolarizations in dendritic spines of ‚Äúinactive‚Äù neurons ( Figures 6 A‚Äì6C), which were strong enough to activate the Ca V 1 channels present in dendritic spines ( Stanika et al., 2016 105. Stanika, R. ‚àô Campiglio, M. ‚àô Pinggera, A. ... Splice variants of the Ca V 1.3 L-type calcium channel regulate dendritic spine morphology Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :34528 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). This demystified the recruitment of Ca V 1 signaling, already indicated pharmacologically.
A potent set of synaptic events combine to drive homeostatic readjustment of APD. Chronic spike blockade drives enhanced spontaneous presynaptic vesicle release ( Jakawich et al., 2010; Lindskog et al., 2010 39. Jakawich, S.K. ‚àô Nasser, H.B. ‚àô Strong, M.J. ...

USA. 2010; 107 :21806-21811 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) and incorporation of postsynaptic, high-conductance, PhTx-sensitive GluA1 receptors ( Kim and Ziff, 2014; Thiagarajan et al., 2005 44. Kim, S. ‚àô Ziff, E.B. Calcineurin mediates synaptic scaling via synaptic trafficking of Ca 2+ -permeable AMPA receptors PLoS Biol. 2014; 12 :e1001900 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar 108.

This increases glutamate-gated cation influx, drives greater spine depolarization, and recruits L-type Ca 2+ channels in spine heads ( Obermair et al., 2004; Yasuda et al., 2003 82. Obermair, G.J. ‚àô Szabo, Z. ‚àô Bourinet, E. ... Differential targeting of the L-type Ca 2+ channel Œ± 1C (Ca V 1.2) to synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments in hippocampal neurons Eur. J.

Neurosci. 2003; 6 :948-955 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ), Mg 2+ -unblocked NMDARs, and Ca 2+ release from internal stores ( Dittmer et al., 2017 17. Dittmer, P.J. ‚àô Wild, A.R. ‚àô Dell‚ÄôAcqua, M.L. ... STIM1 Ca 2+ Sensor Control of L-type Ca 2+ -Channel-Dependent Dendritic Spine Structural Plasticity and Nuclear Signaling Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :321-334 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our scenario ( Figure 7 M) accounts for L-type channel participation in responses triggered by chronic TTX; L-type channel involvement in responses to chronic depolarization is well known ( O‚ÄôLeary et al., 2010 80. O‚ÄôLeary, T. ‚àô van Rossum, M.C. ‚àô Wyllie, D.J. Homeostasis of intrinsic excitability in hippocampal neurones: dynamics and mechanism of the response to chronic depolarization J. Physiol. 2010; 588 :157-170 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ca 2+ channel-triggered signaling in response to chronic inactivity and depolarization runs counter to conventional expectations of diametrically opposing effector actions. Our data suggest that L-type-dependent signaling can be mobilized to achieve the appropriate response irrespective of the direction of the initial perturbation.
Strikingly, the Ca V 1 blocker nimodipine completely abolished TTX-induced CaMK activation, Nova-2 translocation, and E29 splicing but only partially inhibited the Ca 2+ transient in spines induced by chronic TTX. We suggest that other Ca 2+ influx pathways contribute to Ca 2+ flux ( Wheeler et al., 2012 120. Wheeler, D.G. ‚àô Groth, R.D. ‚àô Ma, H. ...

Li, B. ‚àô Tadross, M.R. ‚àô Tsien, R.W. Sequential ionic and conformational signaling by calcium channels drives neuronal gene expression Science. 2016; 351 :863-867 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) to help trap activated CaMKII ( Wang et al., 2017 117.

Chem. 2017; 292 :17324-17336 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Translocation of a CaMK is a recurrent theme in cytonuclear signaling in neurons, but the identity of the kinase varies ( Cohen et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2014 11. Cohen, S.M. ‚àô Ma, H. ‚àô Kuchibhotla, K.V. ...

Œ≥CaMKII shuttles Ca 2+ /CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression Cell. 2014; 159 :281-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the present case of chronic inactivity-induced signaling, sensitivity to the selective CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 indicated that a CaMKK was involved. These findings resembled studies in C. elegans where cytonuclear signaling relies on a monomeric CaMKK (CKK-1) that translocates across the nuclear membrane ( Kimura et al., 2002 46. Kimura, Y. ‚àô Corcoran, E.E. ‚àô Eto, K. ... A CaMK cascade activates CRE-mediated transcription in neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans EMBO Rep. 2002; 3 :962-966 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Precedent exists for regulated cytonuclear distribution of Œ≤CaMKK ( Cao et al., 2011; Karacosta et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2001 10. Cao, W. ‚àô Sohail, M. ‚àô Liu, G. ...

Immunohistochemical localization of Ca( 2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase Œ≤ in the rat central nervous system Neurosci. Res. 2001; 39 :175-188 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), but its molecular mechanism needs elucidation. Œ≤CaMKK lacks a classic NLS, but it might rely on regulation of its nuclear export signal (NES) ( Xu et al., 2012 125. Xu, D. ‚àô Farmer, A. ‚àô Collett, G. ... Sequence and structural analyses of nuclear export signals in the NESdb database Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23 :3677-3693 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ) through interaction with a resident nuclear protein.
CaMKIV was, as expected, the target of Œ≤CaMKK activation, as judged by elevation of pCaMKIV and its blockade by STO-609. Finding that CaMKIV was prebound to its substrate Nova-2 opens up the possibility of local signaling events. This would minimize the perturbation of nuclear Ca 2+ regulation overall, desirable for signaling extending over hours rather than seconds to minutes. To be activated by CaMKK, CaMKIV must be bound to Ca 2+ /CaM. In one scenario, Œ≤CaMKK could locally transfer Ca 2+ /CaM to CaMKIV while retaining most of its catalytic activity, a known feature of this enzyme ( Anderson et al., 1998; Edelman et al., 1996; Tokumitsu and Soderling, 1996 1. Anderson, K.A. ‚àô Means, R.L. ‚àô Huang, Q.H. ... Components of a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase cascade.

Requirements for calcium and calmodulin in the calmodulin kinase activation cascade J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :5617-5622 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with such an intranuclear handoff, buffering of nuclear free Ca 2+ /CaM by CaMBP4 nuc completely inhibited chronic inactivity-induced Nova-2 translocation ( Figures 4 D and 4E).
CaMKIV has been identified previously as a key player in homeostatic plasticity of excitatory neurons by Ibata et al. (2008) 36. Ibata, K. ‚àô Sun, Q. ‚àô Turrigiano, G.G. Rapid synaptic scaling induced by changes in postsynaptic firing Neuron. 2008; 57 :819-826 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar and Joseph and Turrigiano (2017) 41. Joseph, A. ‚àô Turrigiano, G.G. All for one but not one for all: excitatory synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability are coregulated by CaMKIV, whereas inhibitory synaptic scaling is under independent control J. Neurosci. 2017; 37 :6778-6785 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar , who found that the synaptic response to 4-h TTX treatment, a relatively brief period of inactivity, could be mimicked by CaMKIV inhibition using STO-609 or overexpression of a dominant-negative CaMKIV. Those findings might seem at odds with enhanced pCaMKIV in neurons undergoing chronic inactivity ( Figures 4 and 7 ). However, reconciliation may be possible based on the dynamics of the homeostatic response. During TTX treatment for 24‚Äì48 h, Kim and Ziff (2014) 44. Kim, S. ‚àô Ziff, E.B. Calcineurin mediates synaptic scaling via synaptic trafficking of Ca 2+ -permeable AMPA receptors PLoS Biol. 2014; 12 :e1001900 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar found initial inhibition of Ca 2+ signaling for at least 6 h, followed by late activation at 48 h, indicating that homeostatic modulation occurs in two phases. Perhaps early inhibition of CaMKIV, together with inhibition of calcineurin, contributes to up-scaling of AMPARs, critical for activation of synaptic NMDARs and Ca V 1; with further inactivity, enhanced synaptic events lead to recruitment of calcium signaling and enhanced nuclear pCaMKIV, vital for regulation of APD.
Regulation of AS by CaMKIV has been studied previously in the context of acute depolarization, acting at conserved CaMKIV-responsive RNA element (CaRRE) sequences in target precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) ( Iijima et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2012; Xie and Black, 2001 37. Iijima, T. ‚àô Wu, K. ‚àô Witte, H. ... SAM68 regulates neuronal activity-dependent alternative splicing of neurexin-1 Cell. 2011; 147 :1601-1614 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar 51.

Depolarization and CaM kinase IV modulate NMDA receptor splicing through two essential RNA elements PLoS Biol. 2007; 5 :e40 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar 63. Liu, G. ‚àô Razanau, A. ‚àô Hai, Y. ... A conserved serine of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L) mediates depolarization-regulated alternative splicing of potassium channels J. Biol.

A CaMK IV responsive RNA element mediates depolarization-induced alternative splicing of ion channels Nature. 2001; 410 :936-939 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). We looked for regulation of inclusion of stress-axis-regulated (STREX) exon (X4 in our study) and for CaRRE sequences flanking E29 but did not find either ( Figure S3 ). This is not surprising in light of evidence that multiple activity-dependent splicing factors (hnRNP L, SAM68, and related STAR [signal transduction and activation of RNA] family members) have specific effects on individual pre-mRNA targets ( Iijima et al., 2011 37. Iijima, T. ‚àô Wu, K. ‚àô Witte, H. ... SAM68 regulates neuronal activity-dependent alternative splicing of neurexin-1 Cell. 2011; 147 :1601-1614 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). For Nova-2 and other splicing factors, puzzles remain regarding how selective control could be exerted if the splicing events are controlled by the same regulator, CaMKIV. Possible differences in the dynamics and localization of specific splicing events need further study.
Similar to Rbfox1 ( Lee et al., 2009 52. Lee, J.A. ‚àô Tang, Z.Z. ‚àô Black, D.L. An inducible change in Fox-1/A2BP1 splicing modulates the alternative splicing of downstream neuronal target exons Genes Dev. 2009; 23 :2284-2293 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), Nova function is regulated by cytonuclear relocation ( Racca et al., 2010 88. Racca, C. ‚àô Gardiol, A. ‚àô Eom, T. ... The Neuronal Splicing Factor Nova Co-Localizes with Target RNAs in the Dendrite Front. Neural Circuits. 2010; 4 :5 PubMed Google Scholar ). Nova-2 positioning is a U-shaped function of activity level, with nuclear exit favored by hyperactivity (seizure induction [ Eom et al., 2013 22. Eom, T. ‚àô Zhang, C. ‚àô Wang, H. ... NOVA-dependent regulation of cryptic NMD exons controls synaptic protein levels after seizure eLife. 2013; 2 :e00178 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ] or sustained depolarization; Figure S7 E) or chronic inactivity. This echoes the U-shaped relationship of CaMKIV activation to activity. Although we focused on Nova-2 actions in the nucleus, Nova-2 has also been found in dendrites, co-localized with its target mRNAs ( Racca et al., 2010 88. Racca, C. ‚àô Gardiol, A. ‚àô Eom, T. ... The Neuronal Splicing Factor Nova Co-Localizes with Target RNAs in the Dendrite Front. Neural Circuits. 2010; 4 :5 PubMed Google Scholar ). Outside of the nucleus, splicing factors might facilitate translocation of their binding partners (e.g., CaMKIV) and regulate the stability and translation of their target mRNAs (see Lee et al., 2016 54. Lee, J.A. ‚àô Damianov, A. ‚àô Lin, C.H. ... Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 regulates the expression of synaptic and autism-related genes Neuron. 2016; 89 :113-128 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar , for such a role of Rbfox1).
In the specific feedback loop we circumnavigated ( Figures 7 M and 7N), each element is genetically implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, or other neuropsychiatric disorders. First, L-type Ca 2+ channels have been implicated repeatedly in ASD and schizophrenia ( Bhat et al., 2012; Purcell et al., 2014; Splawski et al., 2004, 2005 2.

Neurobiol. 2003; 13 :354-365 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, Œ≤CaMKK (gene name CAMKK2 ) exhibits sporadic mutations in individuals with schizophrenia with severe biochemical effects ( Luo et al., 2014; O‚ÄôBrien et al., 2017 65. Luo, X.J. ‚àô Li, M. ‚àô Huang, L. ..., MooDS SCZ Consortium Convergent lines of evidence support CAMKK2 as a schizophrenia susceptibility gene Mol.

Third, Nova-2 mediates splicing of hundreds of pre-mRNAs, encoding proteins prominent at synaptic sites ( Saito et al., 2016; Ule et al., 2005 92.

Finally, KCNMA1 , encoding the BK channel, is causally involved in certain sporadic forms of ASD ( Laumonnier et al., 2006 48. Laumonnier, F. ‚àô Roger, S. ‚àô Gu√©rin, P. ...

Zhang, L. ‚àô Li, X. ‚àô Zhou, R. ... Possible role of potassium channel, big K in etiology of schizophrenia Med. Hypotheses. 2006; 67 :41-43 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ); inclusion of BK exon E29 is significantly lower in ASD samples than in matched controls ( Parikshak et al., 2016 84. Parikshak, N.N. ‚àô Swarup, V. ‚àô Belgard, T.G. ... Genome-wide changes in lncRNA, splicing, and regional gene expression patterns in autism Nature. 2016; 540 :423-427 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these findings suggest that individual steps in the adaptive feedback pathway not only contribute to homeostatic regulation but might also go awry in neuropsychiatric disorders ( Mullins et al., 2016 75. Mullins, C. ‚àô Fishell, G. ‚àô Tsien, R.W. Unifying views of autism spectrum disorders: a consideration of autoregulatory feedback loops Neuron. 2016; 89 :1131-1156 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 N). In pinpointing players in E-AS coupling that seem to support pathogenesis, our results align with generally altered splicing in ASD ( Parikshak et al., 2016 84. Parikshak, N.N. ‚àô Swarup, V. ‚àô Belgard, T.G. ... Genome-wide changes in lncRNA, splicing, and regional gene expression patterns in autism Nature. 2016; 540 :423-427 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ), possibly arising from this kind of regulatory loop or side branches from it. Thus, correction of faulty E-AS coupling merits consideration as a therapeutic strategy ( H√©bert et al., 2014 31. H√©bert, B. ‚àô Pietropaolo, S. ‚àô M√™me, S. ... Rescue of fragile X syndrome phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice by a BK Ca channel opener molecule Orphanet J. Rare Dis. 2014; 9 :124 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).

HEK293 cell lines (human, female) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured in standard Dulbeco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 Œºg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine. All cells used were negative for mycoplasma. The cell lines were authenticated by the source repository.
Cortical neurons were cultured from postnatal day 0 (P0) male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups as previously described ( Li et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2014 59.

Œ≥CaMKII shuttles Ca 2+ /CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression Cell. 2014; 159 :281-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mixed cohorts of female and male pups were used for all experiments to minimize gender effects. The frontal cortex was isolated and washed twice in ice-cold modified HBSS (4.2 mM NaHCO 3 and 1 mM HEPES, pH 7.35, 300 mOsm) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT). Samples were washed and digested for 30 min in a papain solution (2.5 mL HBSS + 145 U papain + 40 ŒºL DNase) at 37¬∞C with gentle shaking every 5 min. Digestion was stopped by adding 5 mL of modified HBSS containing 20% fetal bovine serum. After additional washing, the tissue was dissociated using Pasteur pipettes of decreasing diameter. The cell suspension was pelleted twice, filtered with a 70 Œºm nylon strainer, and plated on 10 mm coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine. The cultures were maintained in NbActiv4 (BrainBits, Springfield, IL), at 37¬∞C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Half of the media was changed at 7 days, and once per week thereafter.
C57BL/6 male and female mice (postnatal day 26), purchased from the Charles River Laboratory, were used for monocular deprivation experiments. The Olig3 Cre mouse line was a gift from Y. Nakagawa, University of Minnesota. R26 floxstop-TeNT (tetoxf/f) mouse line was a gift from M. Goulding at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. These two mouse strains were maintained on a mixed background (Swiss Webster and C57/ B16). All mice were housed with a 12 hour light-dark cycle. Mixed cohorts of female and male mice were used for all experiments to minimize gender effects. Animal protocols were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at New York University and Sun Yat-sen University.
Nova-2 mutants were produced by Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). BK channel without E29 was first cloned from pcDNA3-BK-GFP ( Li et al., 2014 58. Li, B. ‚àô Jie, W. ‚àô Huang, L. ... Nuclear BK channels regulate gene expression via the control of nuclear calcium signaling Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :1055-1063 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) via PCR and inserted into pCKII-GFP construct with an Œ±CaMKII promoter to restrict expression to pyramidal cells ( Li et al., 2016 59. Li, B. ‚àô Tadross, M.R. ‚àô Tsien, R.W. Sequential ionic and conformational signaling by calcium channels drives neuronal gene expression Science. 2016; 351 :863-867 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). E29 sequence was synthesized and inserted by Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). The splice reporter containing E29 and partial flanking intron sequences were cloned by PCR from genomic DNA obtained from rat brain tissue and inserted into pFlare5 vector ( Stoilov et al., 2008 106. Stoilov, P. ‚àô Lin, C.H. ‚àô Damoiseaux, R. ... A high-throughput screening strategy identifies cardiotonic steroids as alternative splicing modulators Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :11218-11223 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other constructs, see Key Resources Table .
Neurons were transfected 7 to 9 days after plating using a high efficiency Ca 2+ - phosphate transfection method ( Jiang and Chen, 2006 40. Jiang, M. ‚àô Chen, G. High Ca 2+ -phosphate transfection efficiency in low-density neuronal cultures Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :695-700 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Experiments were performed 12-14 days after plating. For chronic spike blockade, neurons were treated with 1 ŒºM TTX on DIV12 for 48 hours to prevent action potential. Where indicated, additional antagonists (5 ŒºM nimodipine, 4 ŒºM KN93 or 3 ŒºM STO-609) were added with TTX. For chronic depolarization, neurons were treated with 20 mM K + (20K), 40K or 60K solution (to depolarize cells; Na + adjusted to maintain osmolarity) for 12 or 24 h. For action potential recording by patch clamp, coverslips with control or TTX-treated neurons were removed from the culture medium, washed and recorded in TTX-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). For imaging the action potential-independent Ca 2+ transients and voltage changes in the dendrites, control or TTX-treated neurons were transferred to a TTX-containing Tyrode‚Äôs solution consisting of (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4 with 1 ŒºM TTX. Where indicated, antagonists were added by manual pipetting to achieve a final concentration of 10 ŒºM PhTx, 10 ŒºM APV, 5 ŒºM nimodipine or 1 ŒºM thapsigargin in TTX-containing Tyrode‚Äôs solution.
The production of lentivirus was performed as previously described ( Ma et al., 2014 67. Ma, H. ‚àô Groth, R.D. ‚àô Cohen, S.M. ... Œ≥CaMKII shuttles Ca 2+ /CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression Cell. 2014; 159 :281-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ), pGFP-C-shLenti constructs encoding shRNAs against Nova-2 or Œ≤CaMKK (OriGene) were transfected into 293T cells along with the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelope plasmid pMD2.g. After 16 h, the medium was changed and the supernatant was collected 24 h later and cleared of cell debris by filtering through a 0.45 mm filter. The viral particles were concentrated by centrifuging the filtrate at 70,000 √ó g for 2 hr at 4¬∞C using a Beckman SW28 rotor. The viral pellet was then resuspended in sterile PBS, aliquoted, and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C. Lentivirus particles (0.5-1 ŒºL of viral stock diluted in 20 ŒºL of PBS per coverslip) were added to cortical cultures containing 500 ŒºL of medium on DIV7. The experiments with overexpressed proteins or shRNAs were performed on DIV14.
Cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer with 20 mM EGTA and 4% sucrose; permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100; blocked with 10% normal goat serum (or donkey serum); and incubated overnight at 4¬∞C in primary antibodies. For surface staining of GluR1 or BK channel, coverslips were fixed and blocked in 7.5% normal donkey serum for 30 minutes in the absence of Triton X-100. Surface staining with primary antibodies ( Key Resources Table ) was then performed for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-PSD-95 and anti-MAP2 ( Figure S6 ) overnight at 4¬∞C. The next day, cells were washed with PBS, incubated at RT for 60 min with Alexa secondary antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes), washed again and mounted with ProLong Gold + DAPI (Invitrogen).
Fixed cells were imaged with a 40X or 60X oil objective on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope. Intensity quantification was performed with custom scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks) or ImageJ (NIH). For all analyses, a region of interest lacking cells was selected in each field of view as an ‚Äòoff-cell‚Äô background, and the mean intensity was subtracted from all cellular regions of interest for each color channel. The following types of analyses were performed from at least three independent cultures in each case: (1) Analysis of Nova-2, pCaMKIV, Œ≤CaMKK and flag-tagged Nova-2 (e.g., Figures 3 and 4 ). Nuclear and cytosolic regions of interest were manually drawn while viewing only DAPI or MAP2 channels, but blinded to the Nova-2 color channel. Background-subtracted mean intensity was quantified and normalized to control conditions. (2) Analysis of pCaMKII, pCaMKI and surface GluR1 intensity (e.g., Figure S6 ) was restricted to MAP2-positive regions of interest containing a proximal dendrite (‚àº60 Œºm in length, ‚àº15 Œºm in width) at least 30 Œºm from cell soma. For GluR1, PSD-95 puncta were identified, and the average intensity of GluR1 signal intensity measured in the region of those puncta. For pCaMKII and pCaMKI, the regions of interests were manually drawn while viewing MAP2 channel but blinded to the pCaMKII color channel. The background was subtracted from pCaMKII intensity. Data represents mean ¬± SEM over 20 such dendrites, normalized to control conditions.
HEK293 cells were transfected via a high efficiency Ca 2+ - phosphate transfection method ( Jiang and Chen, 2006 40. Jiang, M. ‚àô Chen, G. High Ca 2+ -phosphate transfection efficiency in low-density neuronal cultures Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :695-700 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ), with constructs encoding CMV promoter-driven BK channel with (E29) or without (ŒîE29) E29, or with splicing reporter constructs co-expressed with or without WT or mutant Nova-2, or with CaMKIV-GFP and flag-Nova-2 constructs, or with CA-CaMKIV and flag-Nova-2 constructs. Experiments were done 2-3 days later. Whole-cell recordings were obtained at room temperature (Axopatch 200B, Molecular Devices). Electrodes were pulled borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, MTW 150-F4), with 5‚Äì8 MŒ© resistances, before 80% series resistance compensation.
DIV 10-14 cultured cortical neurons were used to measure homeostatic changes in action potential waveforms. Cultured cortical neuron coverslips were placed into a submerged recording chamber and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at 4 mL/min held at room temperature (20-25¬∞C) and bubbled with 95%/5% O 2 /CO 2 . All cells were measured in current clamp mode using borosilicate patch electrodes with tip resistance of 2-4 MŒ©. Recordings were not corrected for the liquid junction potential. Data were sampled at 10 kHz and low pass filtered at 2 kHz using a Bessel filter in pClamp 9 software. Recordings were not used if the access resistance was above 25 MŒ© or changed significantly throughout the recording (> 20%).
The ACSF contained (in mM): 3 KCl, 10 D-Glucose, 122 NaCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.3 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 26 NaHCO 3 . The internal pipette solution contained (in mM): 130 K Gluconate, 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 Tris-Phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP.
To minimize changes in action potential duration due to depolarizing current steps, all action potentials were evoked as a rebound spike (anodal break response) ( Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952 34. Hodgkin, A.L. ‚àô Huxley, A.F. A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve J. Physiol. 1952; 117 :500-544 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a 500 ms long pulse between ‚àí500 pA and ‚àí800 pA was injected into the neuron before it was allowed to rebound to resting potential. Upon return to resting potential a single action potential was usually evoked and sweeps where an action potential was successfully evoked were used for analysis. Using this method allows an action potential to be evoked from a membrane potential negative enough to maximize removal of inactivation and minimize the influence of variations in resting potential.
Action potential half width was measured using custom MATLAB scripts. Briefly, the action potential amplitude (baseline to action potential peak value) was measured and the time between the half peak amplitude on the rising and falling phases was taken to be the action potential half width.
For recordings in HEK cells a symmetrical solution (containing equal ionic concentrations in the internal pipette solution and external solution) was used containing (in mM): 10 K Gluconate, 2 KCl, 2 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 9.93 CaCl 2 , 10 EGTA, 10 Glucose. A current-voltage (I-V) relationship was measured in voltage clamp mode with 250 ms long voltage steps between ‚àí100 mV and 100 mV in 10 mV increments. Custom MATLAB scripts were used offline to take current measurements when the membrane current stabilized after voltage steps.
Neurons were transfected with GCaMP6s on DIV 7-9 and Ca 2+ transients were imaged on DIV13 to 15. Images were collected with a 40X oil objective on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope, 300 ms per frame. Intensity quantification was performed with custom scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks).
For imaging of Ca 2+ transients in soma, the 488 nm fluorescence changes were quantified using regions of interest in cell soma ( Figure 1 B). Ca 2+ transients were imaged in TTX-free Tyrode‚Äôs solution, consisting of (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4. The amplitude of single action-induced Ca 2+ transient was defined by the minimal amplitude of single Ca 2+ transient that could propagate to the entire cell (soma and dendritic tree). The Ca 2+ transients that arose locally in the soma but did not propagate to the dendrite was regarded as local under-threshold depolarization-induced Ca 2+ transients and was eliminated from the quantification. For imaging the action potential-independent Ca 2+ transients in the soma, control or TTX-treated neurons were imaged in a TTX-containing Tyrode‚Äôs solution.
For Ca 2+ transients in dendrite, a ‚àº200 Œºm long dendrite located at least 30 Œºm from cell soma was chosen. Ca 2+ transients were imaged in TTX-containing Tyrode‚Äôs solution. Where indicated, antagonists were added by manual pipetting to achieve a final concentration of 10 ŒºM PhTx, 10 ŒºM APV, 5 ŒºM nimodipine or 1 ŒºM thapsigargin in TTX-containing Tyrode‚Äôs solution.
In dendritic trees, sites of spontaneous Ca 2+ influx were identified as regions of interest (ROIs) which showed sparse peaks of GCaMP6s fluorescence through time, many of which spatially overlapped with spine-like protrusions in baseline GCaMP6s images highlighting dendritic trees structure ( Figures 6 D and 6F). ROI shape and number were obtained by automatically computing a series of operations. First, temporal stacks of fluorescence images were de-noised and the baseline GCaMP6s fluorescence was subtracted pixel-wise. Noise elimination was performed using a custom method that kept intact the non-random correlation between neighboring pixels showing coordinated activity in order to preserve localized signals from Ca 2+ influx. An overly large set of putative ROIs were then identified by using the separable non-negative matrix factorization (sNMF) algorithm. sNMF works by identifying strong but temporally sparse signals and preventing the temporal redundancy between extracted signals - a good model for spontaneous Ca 2+ signals in dendrites. The final ROI set was obtained by unbiasedly selecting only those with cumulated temporal fluorescence ( ‚àö ‚àë ùíï ùë≠ ‚Å¢ ( ùíï ) 2 ) greater than the average + 3 √ó the standard deviation of cumulated fluorescence values drawn outside candidate ROIs.
Cultured pyramidal neurons were transfected via a high efficiency Ca 2+ - phosphate method 7-9 days after plating ( Jiang and Chen, 2006 40. Jiang, M. ‚àô Chen, G. High Ca 2+ -phosphate transfection efficiency in low-density neuronal cultures Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :695-700 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ), with 1 Œºg pcDNA3.1/Puro-CAG-ASAP1 plasmid ( St-Pierre et al., 2014 104. St-Pierre, F. ‚àô Marshall, J.D. ‚àô Yang, Y. ... High-fidelity optical reporting of neuronal electrical activity with an ultrafast fluorescent voltage sensor Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :884-889 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Experiments were done 5-7 days later. In voltage imaging data in Figures 6 A‚Äì6C, the spontaneous AP in soma and bAP in dendritic spines were monitored by simultaneously measuring the ŒîF/F of voltage sensor ASAP1 in soma and dendritic spines. We reasoned that 1) only action potential, instead of subthreshold synaptic current, could backpropagate from soma to dendritic trees and elicit simultaneous voltage changes in soma, different dendritic branches and dendritic spines; 2) due to the high on and off kinetics of ASAP1 (‚àº2ms), high speed recording (2.87 ms / frame in our experiments) of the ŒîF/F changes could reliably detect single spontaneous action potential; ŒîF/F changes induced by single action potential were comparable in both amplitude and duration; ŒîF/F changes induced by burst of action potentials were much larger in amplitude and duration and were discarded in our analysis. Accordingly, we named the simultaneous ŒîF/F changes (voltage changes) in soma and spines as ‚ÄúAP in soma‚Äù and ‚ÄúbAP in spine,‚Äù respectively, and named the ŒîF/F changes (voltage changes) that took place only in spines as ‚ÄúVspine.‚Äù When measuring Vspine, TTX was acutely applied to eliminate action potentials. A narrow region of interest containing the plasma membrane of dendritic spines (30-80 Œºm from soma) and cell soma were chosen, and time lapse imaging with a speed of 2.87 ms per frame was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope, utilizing GFP filter sets. Background-subtracted fluorescence intensity were analyzed in ImageJ (NIH). ASAP1 waveforms were plotted as -ŒîF/F (to account for the negative change in ASAP1 fluorescence upon depolarization) and corrected for bleaching. The noise was filtered with LOWESS smoothing. Identical cell-selection, bleaching correction and noise-filtering parameters were used for all datasets in Figure 6 . Data is plotted as mean ¬± SEM of 14-15 cells for each condition.
To calculate the standard fluorescence-voltage (ŒîF/F-ŒîV) curve for ASAP1, neurons were perfused high K + Tyrode‚Äôs solutions with Na + adjusted to maintain osmolarity. The change of fluorescence intensity (-ŒîF/F) was plot against voltage according to 4 mM K+ (4K), ‚àí60 mV; 20K, ‚àí37 mV; 40K, ‚àí19 mV; 60K, ‚àí9 mV; 90K, 0 mV ( Wheeler et al., 2012 120. Wheeler, D.G. ‚àô Groth, R.D. ‚àô Ma, H. ... Ca( V) 1 and Ca( V) 2 channels engage distinct modes of Ca( 2+ ) signaling to control CREB-dependent gene expression Cell. 2012; 149 :1112-1124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). The membrane potentials in different conditions were then calculated according to the peak values of -ŒîF/F.
Immunoprecipitation was performed with Dynabeads Protein G Immunoprecipitation Kit (Life Technologies) following the kit protocol as described ( Li et al., 2016 59. Li, B. ‚àô Tadross, M.R. ‚àô Tsien, R.W. Sequential ionic and conformational signaling by calcium channels drives neuronal gene expression Science. 2016; 351 :863-867 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, for binding the antibody with the beads, 5 Œºg of antibody or control IgG was crosslinked and incubated at room temperature with 100 ŒºL Dynabeads. The supernatant was removed with the help of a magnet to retain the bead-antibody complex, which was then washed with Ab Binding & Washing Buffer. For lysate preparation, cultured cortical neurons or HEK293 were washed with PBS and lysed on ice with IP Lysis Buffer (Pierce) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4¬∞C to pellet the cell debris. The resulting supernatant was incubated with bead-antibody complex with rotation for 30 min at room temperature. The bead-antibody-antigen complex was then washed 3 times using washing buffer. The protein complex was eluted with Elution buffer and the eluent was mixed and heated with 2 √ó SDS sample buffer containing Œ≤-mercaptoethanol at 90¬∞C for 10 min.
Nuclear and cytosolic protein fraction was performed as described ( Li et al., 2014 58. Li, B. ‚àô Jie, W. ‚àô Huang, L. ... Nuclear BK channels regulate gene expression via the control of nuclear calcium signaling Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :1055-1063 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) . Briefly, nuclear and cytosolic protein was extracted using the Pierce Nuclear Protein Extraction Kit (Thermo), following the manual. Neurons were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 3 min at 4¬∞C and were resuspended in 200 ŒºL precooled CER I by 15 s of intense vortexing. The solution was then incubated on ice for 10 min. CER II (11 Œºl) was precooled and added to the solution. After 5 s of intense vortexing, the solution was incubated on ice for 1 min. After another 5 s of intense vortexing, the solution was then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min at 4¬∞C and the supernatant collected as cytosolic protein. NER (100 Œºl) was added to the precipitate and the sample vibrated intensively for 15 s. The solution was then incubated on ice for 10 min. The vibration and incubation were repeated four times, and then the precipitate was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4¬∞C. The supernatant represented purified nuclear protein.
Plasma membrane protein extraction was performed with Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit as described ( Li et al., 2014 58. Li, B. ‚àô Jie, W. ‚àô Huang, L. ... Nuclear BK channels regulate gene expression via the control of nuclear calcium signaling Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :1055-1063 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). For surface biotinylation, neurons were chilled on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then incubated with PBS dissolved sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin for 30 min at 4¬∞C. Unreacted biotin was quenched by washing cells with Quenching Solution. Cultures were harvested in Lysis Buffer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 2 min at 4¬∞C. The resulting supernatant was rotated 1 hr at room temperature with NeutrAvidin Agarose. The beads were washed with Wash Buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with each antibody.
Whole cell lysate was performed as previously described ( Li et al., 2016 59. Li, B. ‚àô Tadross, M.R. ‚àô Tsien, R.W. Sequential ionic and conformational signaling by calcium channels drives neuronal gene expression Science. 2016; 351 :863-867 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were lysed with CelLytic M Cell Lysis Reagent (Sigma). Protein concentration was measured by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo). The lysates were combined with 2 √ó SDS loading buffer, then boiled for 10 min.
Protein samples were loaded onto 4%‚Äì20% gradient precast or 10% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) for 1 h at 350 mA, and membranes were incubated in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4¬∞C with primary antibodies. The blots were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 15 min and then incubated with IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h in PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was detected by an Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor).
RNA pull-down was performed with Magnetic RNA-Protein Pull-Down Kit (Thermo) following the manual. Briefly, synthesized 5‚Ä≤-biotinylated 2‚Ä≤-OMe-RNA oligonucleotides (Eurofins) ( Key Resources Table ) were bound to streptavidin magnetic beads (Thermo) in RNA Capture Buffer at room temperature with agitation. Cleared brain lysates from 1-month old mouse cortex ( Figure 2 B) or transfected HEK cells ( Figure S5 E) prepared in IP Lysis Buffer (Pierce) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors mixed with Protein-RNA Binding Buffer, and then incubated with the packed beads at 4¬∞C for 1 hr. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer and the precipitate was subjected to immunoblot analysis. Signal intensities were quantified by an Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor).
RNA immunoprecipitation was performed with Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Sigma) following the manual. Briefly, 5 Œºg of anti-Nova-2 antibody or control IgG were incubated with magnetic beads in RIP wash buffer at room temperature for 30 mins. The antibody prebound beads were then washed 3 times with RIP wash buffer at room temperature. For lysate preparation, mouse cortical lysates were prepared with complete RIP Lysis Buffer. The lysates were mixed with prebound beads in RIP Immunoprecipitation Buffer containing RIP wash buffer, EDTA and RNase inhibitor, overnight with rotation at 4¬∞C. The magnetic beads antibody-RNA binding protein complex was washed with wash buffer and then re-suspended in proteinase K buffer at 55¬∞C for 30 minutes. Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and chloroform were used to separate the phase and the RNA was precipitated with Salt Solution I, Salt Solution II, Precipitate Enhancer and absolute ethanol at ‚àí80¬∞C overnight. The RNA precipitation was centrifugated and washed with 80% ethanol solution. The pellets were dried and resuspended in RNase-free water and used for further RT-PCR.
Total RNA was isolated from cortical neurons or HKE 293 cells with RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using oligo dT and Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with AmpliTaq Gold¬Æ 360 Master Mix with DY-682 labeled primers (for X6). The PCR products were either resolved on agarose gel (X1-X5) or denatured and resolved on 6% polyacrylamide/8 M urea denaturing gels (X6). The band density was analyzed by an Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor). qPCR was performed with SYBR-green PCR master mix (Fermentas) with primers ( Table S1 ) using the DNA engine Opticon 2 (Bio-Rad).
The Olig3 Cre mouse line was a gift from Y. Nakagawa, University of Minnesota. R26 floxstop-TeNT (tetoxf/f) was a gift from M. Goulding at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Neurotransmission is selectively blocked from the thalamic cells as expression of Cre removes a stop codon at the R26 locus (removing the flox sites) permitting the expression of the tetanus toxin light chain subunit (TeNT) only within thalamic Olig3 + neurons. Olig3 Cre mice were bred with animals that were homozygous for tetoxf/f. Pups from the subsequent litters were genotyped for Cre and presence of the TeNT allele in the R26 locus. Olig 3 Cre -only animals were used as controls and Olig3 Cre plus tetoxf/+ heterozygous animals as mutants. All mouse strains were maintained on a mixed background (Swiss Webster and C57/ B16).
Mice were perfused inter cardiac with 4% PFA after being anesthetized either on ice or using Sleepaway IP administration. Brains were post-fixed for 30 minutes and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose following the perfusion and brain harvest. 16Œºm coronal sections were obtained using Cryostat (Leica Biosystems) and collected on super-frost coated slides, then allowed to dry overnight and stored at ‚àí20¬∞C until use. For immunofluorescence, cryosections were thawed and allowed to dry for 5-10 min and rinsed twice in 1x PBS. They were incubated at room temperature in a blocking solution of PBST (PBS-0.1%Tx-100) and 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) for 60min, followed by incubation with primary antibodies in PBS-T and 1% NDS at 4¬∞C overnight. Samples were then washed 3 times with PBS-T and incubated with fluorescence conjugated secondary Alexa antibodies (Life Technologies) in PBS-T with 1% NDS at room temperature for 60-90min. Slides were then incubated for 30 s with DAPI, washed 3 times with PBS-T and once with PBS. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 Laser scanning microscope.
The monocular deprivation was performed following previous study ( Ma et al., 2013 66. Ma, W.P. ‚àô Li, Y.T. ‚àô Tao, H.W. Downregulation of cortical inhibition mediates ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 :11276-11280 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the mice (postnatal day 26) were anesthetized with the mixture of 100 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 10 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride intraperitoneally. Under microscope and illuminator, the eyelashes and the edge of eyelids were cut using the spring scissors. The eyelids of the right eye were sutured with three mattress sutures. A thin layer of xylocaine 2% Jelly and bacitracin zinc ointment was applied to the sutured eyelids. After 5 days monocular deprivation, mice brains were sliced for immunostaining or RNA isolation. Nova-2 localization or E29 splicing in the monocular region of primary cortex V1, both contralateral and ipsilateral to the visual deprived eye, was analyzed.
Protein sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis were perform as described ( Ma et al., 2014 67. Ma, H. ‚àô Groth, R.D. ‚àô Cohen, S.M. ... Œ≥CaMKII shuttles Ca 2+ /CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression Cell. 2014; 159 :281-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, flag-tagged Nova-2 were co-transfected with CA-CaMKIV or GFP into HEK293 cells. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with IP Lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The lysates were mixed with CaM kinase reaction buffer (Enzo Life Sciences) and incubated with anti-flag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and Protein A/G Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitated complex was separated by SDS-PAGE. Corresponding areas showing Nova-2 bands were cut out from the Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Gel pieces underwent in-gel digestion and the phosphopeptides were enriched by titanium dioxide (GL Sciences Inc., Japan) based on a previously published protocol ( Rappsilber et al., 2007 90. Rappsilber, J. ‚àô Mann, M. ‚àô Ishihama, Y. Protocol for micro-purification, enrichment, pre-fractionation and storage of peptides for proteomics using StageTips Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :1896-1906 Crossref Scopus (1979) PubMed Google Scholar ). Resulting peptides were subjected to Nano LC-MS/MS analysis using a Thermo Scientific EASY-nLC 1000 coupled to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A self-packed 75Œºm √ó 25 cm reversed phase column (Reprosil C18, 3Œºm, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) was used for peptide separation. Peptides were eluted by a gradient of 3%‚Äì30% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 60 min at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The Q Exactive was operated in the data-dependent mode with survey scans acquired at a resolution of 50,000 at m/z 400. Up to the top 10 most abundant precursors from the survey scan were selected with an isolation window of 1.6 Thomsons and fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation with normalized collision energies of 27. The maximum ion injection times for the survey scan and the MS/MS scans were 20 and 60 ms, respectively, and the ion target value for both scan modes were set to 1,000,000. Each sample was processed and analyzed in triplicate.
Phosphopeptide identification and quantitation was performed as described ( Ma et al., 2014 67. Ma, H. ‚àô Groth, R.D. ‚àô Cohen, S.M. ... Œ≥CaMKII shuttles Ca 2+ /CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression Cell. 2014; 159 :281-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the raw files were processed using the MaxQuant computational proteomics platform version 1.2.7.0 for peptide identification and quantitation. The fragmentation spectra were searched against the Uniprot protein database allowing up to two missed tryptic cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and phosphorylation of serine/threonine/tyrosine, oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation were used as variable modifications for database searching. The precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set to 7 and 20 ppm, respectively. Quantitation of the phosphopeptides was performed using the ion intensity values calculated by MaxQuant for the quintuply charged peptides. Normalization of phosphopeptide intensities to global peptide intensities had no effect on calculated ratios.
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software). Means of two groups were compared using Student‚Äôs t test. One-way ANOVA was used to compare group means between more than two groups, followed by either Dunnett‚Äôs multiple comparisons test when all other groups were compared to the control group, or Tukey‚Äôs multiple comparisons test when means of each pair of groups were compared. All comparisons are two-sided. Statistical significance was determined as follows: ‚àó p < 0.05, ‚àó‚àó p < 0.01. Data are shown as mean ¬± SEM. The statistical details of all experiments, including the number of samples and p values, can be found in figures and figure legends.
