Title: Cell surface fluctuations regulate early embryonic lineage sorting


Abstract: Summary

In development, lineage segregation is coordinated in time and space. An important example is the mammalian inner cell mass, in which the primitive endoderm (PrE, founder of the yolk sac) physically segregates from the epiblast (EPI, founder of the fetus). While the molecular requirements have been well studied, the physical mechanisms determining spatial segregation between EPI and PrE remain elusive. Here, we investigate the mechanical basis of EPI and PrE sorting. We find that rather than the differences in static cell surface mechanical parameters as in classical sorting models, it is the differences in surface fluctuations that robustly ensure physical lineage sorting. These differential surface fluctuations systematically correlate with differential cellular fluidity, which we propose together constitute a non-equilibrium sorting mechanism for EPI and PrE lineages. By combining experiments and modeling, we identify cell surface dynamics as a key factor orchestrating the correct spatial segregation of the founder embryonic lineages.

Section: Introduction

An essential event in the development of a mammal is the segregation of the epiblast (EPI), which will form the fetus, from the extraembryonic tissues that manage implantation, nutrition, and patterning of the fetus. The first step of this process is the formation of the blastocyst, which has been well described in mouse ( Nishioka et al., 2009 61. Nishioka, N. ∙ Inoue, K.-I. ∙ Adachi, K. ...

The blastocyst forms as the outside cells of the pre-implantation embryo differentiate into trophectoderm (the source of the placenta) and cavitation occurs ( Figure 1 A). At this point, the inside cells comprising the inner cell mass (ICM) are aggregated and firmly adhered to the trophectoderm on the proximal pole of the blastocyst ( Figure 1 A, E3.5). Subsequently, a subpopulation of ICM cells becomes sensitive to fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), heralding primitive endoderm (PrE) bias ( Guo et al., 2010 30. Guo, G. ∙ Huss, M. ∙ Tong, G.Q. ...

Within the uterus, and ex vivo , precursors of the EPI and PrE emerge in a spatially random manner ( Chazaud et al., 2006 14. Chazaud, C. ∙ Yamanaka, Y. ∙ Pawson, T. ...

Sci. 2003; 358 :1341-1348; discussion 1349 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Coincident with identity acquisition, the cells physically sort, resulting in PrE establishing a single layer of cells covering the cavity-facing surface of the ICM with the EPI enclosed between the PrE and polar trophectoderm ( Plusa et al., 2008 67. Plusa, B. ∙ Piliszek, A. ∙ Frankenberg, S. ... Distinct sequential cell behaviours direct primitive endoderm formation in the mouse blastocyst Development. 2008; 135 :3081-3091 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ). The chemical signaling requirements for fate specification are well understood: FGF4-dependent ERK activation is necessary and sufficient for PrE specification in the mouse ( Yamanaka et al., 2010 97. Yamanaka, Y. ∙ Lanner, F. ∙ Rossant, J. FGF signal-dependent segregation of primitive endoderm and epiblast in the mouse blastocyst Development. 2010; 137 :715-724 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). Much less is known about how proper positioning of PrE is achieved. It is known that once all PrE cells are on the cavity-facing surface of the ICM, they polarize ( Bassalert et al., 2018 7. Bassalert, C. ∙ Valverde-Estrella, L. ∙ Chazaud, C. Primitive endoderm differentiation: from specification to epithelialization Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2018; 128 :81-104 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) and undergo aPKC-dependent epithelization ( Saiz et al., 2013 76. Saiz, N. ∙ Grabarek, J.B. ∙ Sabherwal, N. ... Atypical protein kinase C couples cell sorting with primitive endoderm maturation in the mouse blastocyst Development. 2013; 140 :4311-4322 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the mechanical means by which PrE cells segregate from the EPI in the first place and then remain on the cavity side until the PrE epithelializes ( Figure 1 A) remains a mystery. This work seeks to investigate the mechanical mechanisms by which the PrE sorts and remains segregated in the ICM.
Several general mechanical mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed previously, including differential adhesion ( Foty and Steinberg, 2004 25. Foty, R.A. ∙ Steinberg, M.S. Cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and tissue segregation in relation to malignancy Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48 :397-409 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ), differential surface tension ( Lecuit and Lenne, 2007 46. Lecuit, T. ∙ Lenne, P.F. Cell surface mechanics and the control of cell shape, tissue patterns and morphogenesis Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8 :633-644 Crossref Scopus (937) PubMed Google Scholar ), and differential cell-cell affinity ( Amack and Manning, 2012 2. Amack, J.D. ∙ Manning, M.L. Knowing the boundaries: extending the differential adhesion hypothesis in embryonic cell sorting Science. 2012; 338 :212-215 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chan et al., 2017 12.

Asymmetric division of contractile domains couples cell positioning and fate specification Nature. 2016; 536 :344-348 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we examined all these possibilities in the context of sorting in the ICM and found that none of these mechanical mechanisms appeared sufficient to explain robust segregation of the PrE lineage from the EPI. Instead, through a combination of experiments and physical modeling, we uncovered that enhanced surface fluctuations in the PrE lineage are a key, intrinsically dynamic, mechanical factor in facilitating the segregation of these early embryonic lineages.

Section: Results

To determine the most relevant stage to investigate ICM sorting, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the gene expression of single ICM cells at E3.75 and combined it with previous analyses performed at E3.5 and E4.5 ( Mohammed et al., 2017 57. Mohammed, H. ∙ Hernando-Herraez, I. ∙ Savino, A. ... Single-cell landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity and cell fate decisions during mouse early gastrulation Cell Rep. 2017; 20 :1215-1228 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed stage-specific clusters, indicating that in the E3.75 ICM, progenitors with specific embryo lineages, pEPI and pPrE, are just beginning to become distinct ( Figures 1 B and S1 A–S1C).
To study the dynamics of segregation of pEPI and pPrE cells in E3.75 ICMs, we generated time-lapse movies of isolated ICMs from embryos expressing both a PrE lineage reporter, Pdgfra H2B-GFP ( Hamilton et al., 2003 32. Hamilton, T.G. ∙ Klinghoffer, R.A. ∙ Corrin, P.D. ... Evolutionary divergence of platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor signaling mechanisms Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23 :4013-4025 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a plasma membrane-localized reporter, mTmG ( Muzumdar et al., 2007 59. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Tasic, B. ∙ Miyamichi, K. ... A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse Genesis. 2007; 45 :593-605 Crossref Scopus (2581) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 C; Video S1 ). With this analysis, we observed that pPrE cells that were initially randomly distributed sorted to the surface of the ICM.

To identify a simplified system to study this lineage segregation, we first confirmed, as shown in Wigger et al. (2017) 95. Wigger, M. ∙ Kisielewska, K. ∙ Filimonow, K. ... Plasticity of the inner cell mass in mouse blastocyst is restricted by the activity of FGF/MAPK pathway Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :15136 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar , that pEPI and pPrE cells in ICMs isolated from E3.5 or E3.75 blastocysts can segregate and commit to EPI and PrE in culture without trophectoderm ( Figure S1 D). The majority of E3.5 ICM formed “miniblastocysts” ( Figure S1 E) containing cavities, with some external cells expressing the trophectoderm marker, CDX2 ( Figure S1 F). The later E3.75 ICMs formed embryoid body-like structures with no cavity or CDX2 expressing cells. After 1 day in culture, the PrE enveloped the EPI, confirmed using immunofluorescence ( Figures S1 G and S1H). Taken together, our data confirm proper fate segregation and maturation in isolated E3.75 ICMs in the absence of trophectoderm, and we conclude that E3.75 is the appropriate stage of the ICM to study what mechanical mechanisms drive sorting of the EPI and PrE.
To understand what drives ICM sorting, we first considered two mechanisms suggested in the literature: differences in cell-cell adhesion or in migration ( Bassalert et al., 2018 7. Bassalert, C. ∙ Valverde-Estrella, L. ∙ Chazaud, C. Primitive endoderm differentiation: from specification to epithelialization Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2018; 128 :81-104 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chazaud et al., 2006 14. Chazaud, C. ∙ Yamanaka, Y. ∙ Pawson, T. ... Early lineage segregation between epiblast and primitive endoderm in mouse blastocysts through the Grb2-MAPK pathway Dev. Cell. 2006; 10 :615-624 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (710) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, cell-cell adhesion forces are generally known to play only a small role in tissue sorting ( Amack and Manning, 2012 2. Amack, J.D. ∙ Manning, M.L. Knowing the boundaries: extending the differential adhesion hypothesis in embryonic cell sorting Science. 2012; 338 :212-215 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maître and Heisenberg, 2011 52. Maître, J.L. ∙ Heisenberg, C.P. The role of adhesion energy in controlling cell-cell contacts Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23 :508-514 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, E-cadherin, an important regulator of cell-cell adhesion in early development ( Halbleib and Nelson, 2006 31. Halbleib, J.M. ∙ Nelson, W.J. Cadherins in development: cell adhesion, sorting, and tissue morphogenesis Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :3199-3214 Crossref Scopus (845) PubMed Google Scholar ), has been shown not to be differentially distributed at the protein level and to be unnecessary for cell sorting in the blastocyst ( Filimonow et al., 2019 23. Filimonow, K. ∙ Saiz, N. ∙ Suwińska, A. ... No evidence of involvement of E-cadherin in cell fate specification or the segregation of Epi and PrE in mouse blastocysts PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0212109 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also found that E-cadherin is not differentially expressed between pEPI and pPrE at E3.75 ( Figure S2 A, showing that N- and P-cadherin (Cdh2 and Cdh3) are also not differentially expressed). Taken together, we conclude that differential cell-cell adhesion is unlikely to play more than a minor role in the sorting of the mouse ICM.
A contribution of directed migration to sorting is more difficult to rule out definitively. However, in images of ICM sorting ( Plusa et al., 2008 67. Plusa, B. ∙ Piliszek, A. ∙ Frankenberg, S. ... Distinct sequential cell behaviours direct primitive endoderm formation in the mouse blastocyst Development. 2008; 135 :3081-3091 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ), there are no indications that pPrE cells in the ICM display protrusions suggestive of mesenchymal migration. Nevertheless, it is possible that pPrE cells in the ICM are capable of amoeboid migration, a migration mode often displayed by cells in confinement ( Paluch et al., 2016 64. Paluch, E.K. ∙ Aspalter, I.M. ∙ Sixt, M. Focal adhesion-independent cell migration Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 32 :469-490 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could be difficult to detect from shape analysis alone. We thus assessed, using 3D confinement assays that facilitate migration of cells capable of amoeboid motility ( Aspalter et al., 2020 5. Aspalter, I.M. ∙ Pönisch, W. ∙ Chalut, K.J. ... Mouse embryonic stem cells switch migratory behaviour during early differentiation bioRxiv. 2020; bioRxiv:2020.12.07.415307 Google Scholar ), the ability of ICM cells to migrate. We found that there was almost no detectable migration of E3.75 ICM cells, regardless of the level of confinement ( Figures S2 B–S2E), even though other cells types can migrate efficiently in similar conditions ( Liu et al., 2015 48. Liu, Y.J. ∙ Le Berre, M. ∙ Lautenschlaeger, F. ... Confinement and low adhesion induce fast amoeboid migration of slow mesenchymal cells Cell. 2015; 160 :659-672 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (561) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that ICM cells do not have a high level of migration competence, making migration an unlikely candidate to drive robust cell sorting.
Given that lineage-specific differences in cell-cell adhesion and migration do not seem to be good candidates to propel robust cell sorting in the blastocyst, we turned to another candidate that has been suggested to drive cell sorting, cell surface mechanics ( Meilhac et al., 2009 55. Meilhac, S.M. ∙ Adams, R.J. ∙ Morris, S.A. ... Active cell movements coupled to positional induction are involved in lineage segregation in the mouse blastocyst Dev. Biol. 2009; 331 :210-221 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, we probed our transcriptomics data for changes in the actin cytoskeleton and its regulators. E3.75 ICM cells, compared with ICM cells at other blastocyst stages, showed the most highly modulated actin-cytoskeleton-related genes ( Figure 1 D; Table S1 ). PCA of each stage based on variable actin-cytoskeleton-related genes showed that their expression became distinct at E3.75 ( Figure 1 E), coinciding with pEPI and pPrE cells sorting, suggesting that there may indeed be mechanical asymmetries arising between pPrE and pEPI at E3.75.
One possible manifestation of mechanical asymmetries, which has been previously proposed to mediate cell sorting, is differential cell surface tension ( Lecuit and Lenne, 2007 46. Lecuit, T. ∙ Lenne, P.F. Cell surface mechanics and the control of cell shape, tissue patterns and morphogenesis Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8 :633-644 Crossref Scopus (937) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate cellular surface tension in the ICM, we first used an atomic force microscope ( Chugh et al., 2017 15. Chugh, P. ∙ Clark, A.G. ∙ Smith, M.B. ... Actin cortex architecture regulates cell surface tension Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19 :689-697 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). The surface tension of pEPI and pPrE isolated from E3.75 ICMs was highly variable, but no significant differences were detected ( Figure S2 F). Cell surface tension predominantly reflects the contractile tension of the actomyosin cortex ( Salbreux et al., 2012 78. Salbreux, G. ∙ Charras, G. ∙ Paluch, E. Actin cortex mechanics and cellular morphogenesis Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22 :536-545 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is primarily controlled by myosin II activity ( Chugh and Paluch, 2018 16. Chugh, P. ∙ Paluch, E.K. The actin cortex at a glance J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131 :jcs186254 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus assessed the levels of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (pMRLC), a key regulator of myosin activity ( Heissler and Sellers, 2016 33. Heissler, S.M. ∙ Sellers, J.R. Various themes of myosin regulation J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 :1927-1946 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon measuring pMRLC levels, we found no difference between pEPI and pPrE ( Figures S2 G and S2H). These results strongly suggest that there is no significant difference in cortical tension between pEPI and pPrE cells. To further test this, we used a complementary approach to assess cortical tension differences, by analyzing the shape of heterotypic cell doublets of pEPI and pPrE ( Figure S2 I). In such doublets, the force-balance equation at the cell-cell contact ( Figure S2 J) implies that the cell with higher cortex tension displays a smaller contact angle. Yet, we found no statistically significant difference in contact angles displayed by pEPI and pPrE cells in heterotypic doublets ( Figure S2 K), and if anything, the pPrE doublets have smaller contact angles than pEPI doublets. Taken together with our AFM data and pMRLC images, we conclude that cortex tension differences are not likely a major factor in driving pEPI/pPrE sorting.
Another suggested mechanical regulator of segregation in developing tissues is differential cell-cell affinity, which is determined by the force balance between cell-cell adhesion, cell surface tensions, and interfacial tension at cell contacts ( Amack and Manning, 2012 2. Amack, J.D. ∙ Manning, M.L. Knowing the boundaries: extending the differential adhesion hypothesis in embryonic cell sorting Science. 2012; 338 :212-215 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chan et al., 2017 12. Chan, E.H. ∙ Chavadimane Shivakumar, P.C. ∙ Clément, R. ... Patterned cortical tension mediated by N-cadherin controls cell geometric order in the Drosophila eye Elife. 2017; 6 :33420 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ; Maître et al., 2012 51. Maître, J.L. ∙ Berthoumieux, H. ∙ Krens, S.F.G. ... Adhesion functions in cell sorting by mechanically coupling the cortices of adhering cells Science. 2012; 338 :253-256 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 54. Maître, J.L. ∙ Turlier, H. ∙ Illukkumbura, R. ... Asymmetric division of contractile domains couples cell positioning and fate specification Nature. 2016; 536 :344-348 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Physical modeling suggests that in multicellular systems, differences in cell-cell affinity between two cell types can be sufficient to drive cell sorting ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). To analyze differential cell-cell affinity, two quantities describing the contact between two cells in a homotypic doublet of each cell type could be measured. The two quantities are differences in contact size (for simplicity we used contact length in max projection images) and differences in contact angle. Contact size is the most straightforward measure; however, for quantifying individual contributions to cell-cell affinity contact angles are useful since they can be used to compute forces more directly from the force-balance equations as they do not require additional geometrical assumptions ( Figures 2 B and S2 J). Ultimately, both contact area and contact angles should be highly correlated and are equally good estimates for cell-cell affinity, and both are used in this work. To test whether differential cell-cell affinity could control ICM sorting, we first measured the external contact angles between pEPI and pPrE doublets made by aggregating two E3.75 Pdgfra H2B-GFP ICM cells ( Figures 2 B and 2C). The external contact angles of homotypic pEPI cell doublets (pEPI::pEPI) were larger than those of both pPrE::pPrE and pEPI::pPrE ( Figure 2 D). An affinity parameter, β , between two cell types can be calculated based on these angles ( Figure 2 B; STAR Methods ). The affinity parameter reflected the cell-cell affinity differential between different types of doublets and was found to be 𝛽 = c o s ⁡ ( 𝜃 p E P I ∷ p E P I ) c o s ⁡ ( 𝜃 p P r E ∷ p P r E ) = 0 . 7 9 ± 0 . 0 4 . (Equation 1) where the reported error is standard deviation. β < 1 indicates that the affinity is greater in pEPI::pEPI than pPrE::pPrE, suggesting that pPrE would be biased to sort to the outside of an aggregate. On the other hand, we also measured contact size directly and found very little difference between the pEPI::pEPI doublets and pPrE::pPrE homotypic doublets ( Figure S2 K), so it is possible that β is closer to 1 than our estimate. Nevertheless, to push the analysis forward, we assume the β we measured from our contact angle measurements, recognizing this is likely a lower extreme of β in this system.
To test whether the measured cell-cell affinity parameter is sufficient to account for the segregation of pEPI and pPrE cells, we used a 3D computational model based on the subcellular element method, termed 3D force-based cell-sorting simulation (CS3D, described in Revell et al. (2019) 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar and also in STAR Methods ). Briefly, each individual cell is modeled as a group of infinitesimal elements, interacting via nearest-neighbor forces. CS3D also incorporates cell growth and division and enables a multiscale modeling of inter- and intracellular interactions in multicellular aggregates such as the ICM. To score sorting in the aggregates, we established a sorting index ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ; STAR Methods ). The sorting index has a range of −1 to 1, where −1 indicates pEPI cells on the outside, 0 indicates random cell positioning (no sorting), and 1 indicates pPrE cells on the outside. With CS3D, contact size is a more straightforward measure of cell-cell affinity than contact angles, and we showed in previous work that contact size differences between two cell types is a very good predictor of whether or not those two cell types will sort in an aggregate comprising those cell types (see Figure 4 in Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). Using CS3D, we simulated sorting in the ICM with the lowest extreme (i.e., highest affinity asymmetry, β = 0.75) of our experimentally observed value of β = 0.79 ± 0.04, with cells dividing from ∼10 to up to ∼50 cells. These numbers represent the approximate beginning and end number of cells in the ICM between E3.5 and E4.5, while the average ICM at mid-blastocyst stage possesses ∼30 cells ( Artus et al., 2013 4. Artus, J. ∙ Kang, M. ∙ Cohen-Tannoudji, M.C. ... PDGF signaling is required for primitive endoderm cell survival in the inner cell mass of the mouse blastocyst Stem Cells. 2013; 31 :1932-1941 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, even the most conservative estimate of differential cell-cell affinity we measured was insufficient to lead to pEPI and pPrE sorting in our simulations. A much stronger differential affinity ( β < ∼0.5) was required in our simulations to efficiently sort cells within the experimental time frame ( Figure 2 E). Our model thus implies that the experimentally measured difference in static mean cell-cell affinity is insufficient to support robust sorting of pEPI and pPrE. Taken together with all the other results, this suggested we were missing a key parameter.
Interestingly, consistent with early studies from the late blastocyst ( Gardner and Papaioannou, 1975 26. Gardner, R.L. ∙ Papaioannou, V.E. The Early Development of Mammals Cambridge Univeristy press, 1975 Google Scholar ), we noticed that pPrE cells displayed a less smooth morphology compared with pEPI cells ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). We thus asked whether these differences reflected increased dynamic cell surface fluctuations in pPrE, which could imply higher fluctuations in cell surface mechanics. To answer this, we isolated pEPI and pPrE cells from several stages of early ICM, including E3.75, and live imaged them for 5 min. We then quantified the amplitude of surface fluctuations displayed by the cells ( Figures 3 B and S3 B; STAR Methods ). Single pPrE cells exhibited significantly larger surface fluctuations than pEPI ( Figure 3 C). We then treated cells from the ICM with exogenous FGF, the primary instructive signal for PrE specification ( Yamanaka et al., 2010 97. Yamanaka, Y. ∙ Lanner, F. ∙ Rossant, J. FGF signal-dependent segregation of primitive endoderm and epiblast in the mouse blastocyst Development. 2010; 137 :715-724 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 C). Treatment with exogenous FGF also led to higher surface fluctuations in the ICM cells, and inhibition of ERK, the downstream effector of FGF signaling, reduced surface fluctuations in ICM cells ( Figure S3 C; Videos S2 and S3 ). Notably, our quantification does not distinguish between different types of cellular protrusions, but visual assessment revealed that the primary manifestation of the surface fluctuations was blebbing ( Videos S4 and S5 ; Figure S3 A).

To examine whether differences in surface fluctuations were observable in the multicellular context, we monitored cellular membrane dynamics in ICMs isolated from blastocysts. Surface fluctuations were clearly visible on the outer edge of cell aggregates. In order to ensure a sufficient number of cells located on the outside layer to perform a quantification of surface fluctuations, we aggregated three isolated ICMs from E3.75 mTmG +/ − Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ blastocysts ( Figure 3 D). We then performed a blinded quantification of surface fluctuations in the ICM aggregates and found that pPrE cells on the outer layer of the ICM aggregate exhibited significantly higher surface fluctuations than similarly located pEPI cells ( Figure 3 E; Video S6 ). In the bulk of the ICM, no blebs or protrusions were visually evident along cell-cell contacts. However, contacts with neighboring cells would likely preclude protrusion extension within the dense ICM. If there are dynamics changes in cell surface mechanical properties, we reasoned this should be visible by studying changes in cell shape within the bulk. To assess possible shape fluctuations within the bulk, we used our movies of aggregated ICMs to first assess cell shape for both pEPI and pPrE over time. To assess cell shape, we measured the cell shape index ( Bi et al., 2015 8. Bi, D. ∙ Lopez, J.H. ∙ Schwarz, J.M. ... A density-independent rigidity transition in biological tissues Nat. Phys. 2015; 11 :1074-1079 Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar ; Park et al., 2015 65. Park, J.A. ∙ Kim, J.H. ∙ Bi, D. ... Unjamming and cell shape in the asthmatic airway epithelium Nat. Mater. 2015; 14 :1040-1048 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is a measure of cell elongation, defined in 2D as cell perimeter divided by the square root of the area (for example, the cell shape index of a circle is ∼3.54). We then used the coefficient of variation of the shape index over time as a proxy for shape fluctuations within a multicellular aggregate. We found that the coefficient of variation of the cell shape index was higher for pPrE than for pEPI, suggesting that cell surface fluctuations are also significantly higher for pPrE compared with pEPI in the bulk of the ICM ( Figure 3 F). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the PrE lineage demonstrates significantly more dynamic cell surface mechanics than the EPI lineage, and they are likely a result of the intracellular signaling that initiates PrE lineage specification.

Surface fluctuations of E3.75 ICM aggregates, related to Figure 3 Time-lapse sequence of isolated E3.75 mTmG+/-PdgfraH2B-GFP/+ 1 ICM aggregates. This file was assembled at one Z-section of the aggregation of every 20 seconds over five minutes. Left: ICM aggregate 1. Right: ICM aggregate 2.
We then speculated that differences in surface fluctuations could contribute to segregating pEPI and pPrE cells. We assessed this hypothesis using physical modeling. To this aim, we extended the CS3D simulations to incorporate cell surface fluctuations by implementing random fluctuations in surface tension ( Figure S4 A). This fluctuation in surface tension simulates blebs in cells with a free surface and fluctuations in cell shape in the bulk of an aggregate ( Figures S4 A and S4B). We introduced a dimensionless parameter ε representing the ratio of surface fluctuations in pPrE to pEPI, and using the measured surface fluctuations of each cell type (from Figure 3 C), we estimated ε ≈ 0.35. We then used CS3D to simulate pEPI and pPrE cell sorting with β = 0.75 and ε = 0, corresponding to equal surface fluctuations in PrE and EPI cells, or the experimentally observed fluctuations differential ε = 0.35. No sorting was observed for ε = 0. However, we observed thorough and robust sorting for ε = 0.35 ( Figure 3 G). We then assembled a phase space of the sorting index for the range β = [0.5, 1.00] and ε = [0.0, 0.40] to cover a wide range of experimental parameters. It is clear from the phase space that, though we see moderate segregation without a fluctuation differential as β approaches sufficiently extreme values of ∼0.5, the cells are capable of sorting even if β = 1 provided the pPrE cells have significantly larger surface fluctuations ( Figure S4 C). Thus, our model suggests that a differential in surface fluctuations could control the robust sorting of pEPI and pPrE.
We then asked which cellular mechanisms led to enhanced surface fluctuations in pPrE cells. As the fluctuations manifested mostly as blebs, the most likely candidate mechanisms are cortical tension, which generates intracellular pressure that drives bleb expansion, or effective membrane tension, which resists any cellular deformation and thus acts against bleb formation ( Charras and Paluch, 2008 13. Charras, G. ∙ Paluch, E. Blebs lead the way: how to migrate without lamellipodia Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :730-736 Crossref Scopus (590) PubMed Google Scholar ). As the static mean cortical tension does not appear to be significantly different between EPI and PrE lineages ( Figures S2 G and S2H), overall differences in cortical tension are unlikely to play a prominent role. Thus, we turned to effective membrane tension, which depends on the in-plane tension of the lipid bilayer and membrane attachments to the underlying cortex ( Pontes et al., 2017 68. Pontes, B. ∙ Monzo, P. ∙ Gauthier, N.C. Membrane tension: a challenging but universal physical parameter in cell biology Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 71 :30-41 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). We measured effective membrane tension using optical tweezers ( De Belly et al., 2020 17. De Belly, H. ∙ Stubb, A. ∙ Yanagida, A. ... Membrane tension gates ERK-mediated regulation of pluripotent cell fate Stem Cells. 2020; 31 :166 Google Scholar ), and found, surprisingly, that it is higher in pPrE than in pEPI cells ( Figure S5 A). Effective membrane tension is primarily regulated by the level of membrane-to-cortex attachment, with the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) protein family ( Fehon et al., 2010 22. Fehon, R.G. ∙ McClatchey, A.I. ∙ Bretscher, A. Organizing the cell cortex: the role of ERM proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :276-287 Crossref Scopus (818) PubMed Google Scholar ) playing a key role. Correspondingly, we found that there were much higher overall levels of phosphorylated ERM (pERM), the active form of ERMs, in pPrE than pEPI cells ( Figure S5 B). These observations appeared counter-intuitive at first, as high membrane tension generally limits blebbing ( Charras and Paluch, 2008 13. Charras, G. ∙ Paluch, E. Blebs lead the way: how to migrate without lamellipodia Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :730-736 Crossref Scopus (590) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significantly, however, the optical tweezer measurement is a highly local measurement, and along with overall higher pERM levels, we observed that there was also a high degree of spatial variability in pERM levels along the cell boundary in pPrE cells ( Figure S5 B). Furthermore, we observed high pERM spatial heterogeneity in the outer layer of the ICM of the E3.75 blastocyst ( Figures S5 B and S5C). This was especially noticeable when the pERM signal was compared with the 8-cell or E4.5 embryos, or the trophectoderm of the E3.75 blastocyst, in which the pERM signal was fairly continuous along the cell surfaces ( Figure S5 D).
To further establish a link between pERM spatial heterogeneity and ERM activity levels, we used a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible constitutively active ezrin (EzrinT567D-IRES-mCherry, or CA-EZR for short) mouse ES cell line ( De Belly et al., 2020 17. De Belly, H. ∙ Stubb, A. ∙ Yanagida, A. ... Membrane tension gates ERK-mediated regulation of pluripotent cell fate Stem Cells. 2020; 31 :166 Google Scholar ). Using this line, we found that cellular mCherry levels anticorrelated with the variability of pERM in the membrane ( Figure S5 E), indicating that the higher the levels of CA-EZR, the less variable the pERM is at the membrane. We also found that upon Dox induction, mCherry expression anticorrelated to surface fluctuations across a broad range of mCherry values ( Figure 4 A), indicating that increasing the levels of active ezrin beyond endogenous levels in ES cells, and thus decreasing pERM heterogeneity, leads to a reduction in surface fluctuations.
We then sought further evidence that surface fluctuations reflect dynamics in cell surface mechanics. For this, we first measured the variability in effective membrane tension and also counted the number of observable blebs over time in several cells. We found that the temporal variability in membrane tension at the single-cell level highly correlates with the amount of blebbing in the cell ( Figures S5 F and S5G). Then, we used STORM microscopy to visualize the actin cortex in pEPI and pPrE and found a higher variation in the thickness of the actin cortex of pPrE cells versus pEPI cells ( Figures S5 H and S5I). Importantly, heterogeneities in ERM levels and in cortex organization can both promote blebbing ( Charras and Paluch, 2008 13. Charras, G. ∙ Paluch, E. Blebs lead the way: how to migrate without lamellipodia Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :730-736 Crossref Scopus (590) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taking these observations together with the spatial heterogeneity of pERM in the PrE lineage, we speculate that differences in the variability, rather than in static mean values of cell surface mechanical parameters, account for the higher cell surface fluctuations observed in pPrE cells compared with pEPI cells.
In order to experimentally test our hypothesis that surface fluctuations regulate sorting, we used our CA-EZR ES cell line to provide a cell system possessing a range of surface fluctuations ( Figure 4 A). We confirmed that the CA-EZR expression did not affect cortical tension or cell-cell affinity, which may have been confounding factors in our physical model ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Using the CA-EZR ES cells, we performed cell aggregation assays to directly assess how cell surface fluctuations affect sorting. As a control, we used an H2B-BFP ES cell line that displays slightly lower levels of cell surface fluctuations compared with the CA-EZR line ( Figure 4 A). We mixed the control ES cells with the CA-EZR ES cells at a 1:1 ratio and cultured these aggregates for 1 day with or without Dox ( Figures 4 D and 4E). We then quantified sorting by calculating the normalized average distance of the mCherry signal from the center of the aggregate, R ( Figure 4 F). Using this measure and thresholding to determine low-, mid-, and high-expressing CA-EZR cells, we found that low-expressing CA-EZR cells, which have enhanced surface fluctuations compared with controls, were preferentially found on the outside of the aggregate, while high-expressing CA-EZR cells, which have reduced surface fluctuations compared with controls, localized to the inside of the aggregate ( Figures 4 D and 4G).
To further test the role of cell surface fluctuations in cell sorting, we developed two different perturbations to increase cell surface fluctuations. The first was siRNA-mediated triple knockdown of ERM (siERM), as depleting ERM decreases effective membrane tension ( Fehon et al., 2010 22. Fehon, R.G. ∙ McClatchey, A.I. ∙ Bretscher, A. Organizing the cell cortex: the role of ERM proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :276-287 Crossref Scopus (818) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to enhanced blebbing, while having little effect on cortical tension ( Diz-Muñoz et al., 2010 20. Diz-Muñoz, A. ∙ Krieg, M. ∙ Bergert, M. ... Control of directed cell migration in vivo by membrane-to-cortex attachment PLoS Biol. 2010; 8 :e1000544 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). The second was siRNA-mediated knockdown of α-actinin-4 (ACTN4) (siACTN4), an actin cross-linker. Indeed, we observed that both siERM and siACTN4 caused individual ES cells to display considerably more blebbing ( Figure 5 A). We then formed cell aggregates comprising either siACNT4 or siERM ES cells with negative control siRNA (siNC)-treated ES cells. In both cases, knockdown cells in aggregates displayed an increased coefficient of variation in cell shape index, suggesting that surface fluctuations were also enhanced in the bulk of aggregates ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Furthermore, in both aggregates containing siACTN4 and siERM, the knockdown cells with higher surface fluctuations sorted toward the outside of the aggregate ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Taken together, our data show that the position of cells within an aggregate is highly influenced by their level of surface fluctuations, thus strongly supporting our hypothesis that differences in surface fluctuations lead to cell sorting in multicellular aggregates.
To test whether surface fluctuations also control sorting in the context of the ICM, we used an approach in which we injected ES cells and subsequently evaluated their chimeric contribution to the embryo. ES cells are a good model system, since they maintain pre-implantation EPI identity in vitro ( Boroviak et al., 2014 11. Boroviak, T. ∙ Loos, R. ∙ Bertone, P. ... The ability of inner-cell-mass cells to self-renew as embryonic stem cells is acquired following epiblast specification Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16 :516-528 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ), and they are highly amenable to genetic manipulation at scale. Moreover, ES cells injected into the embryo anytime before the early mid-blastocyst stage (∼E3.5) should almost exclusively localize to the EPI on the inside of the ICM by E4.0 ( Alexandrova et al., 2016 1. Alexandrova, S. ∙ Kalkan, T. ∙ Humphreys, P. ... Selection and dynamics of embryonic stem cell integration into early mouse embryos Development. 2016; 143 :24-34 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Posfai et al., 2021 69. Posfai, E. ∙ Schell, J.P. ∙ Janiszewski, A. ... Evaluating totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :49-60 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that if we performed perturbations on ES cells to increase their cell surface fluctuations and then injected them into the ICM prior to E3.5, instead of localizing on the inside of the ICM as usual, they would localize toward the blastocoel side of the ICM, which we refer to as outside the ICM. To test this hypothesis, we utilized two different experimental paradigms probing chimeric incorporation of ES cells into the ICM. First, to test whether ES cells with higher surface fluctuations would sort from the inside to the outside of the ICM, we injected ES cells into the 8-cell stage embryos (E2.5) ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Next, to test whether ES cells with higher surface fluctuations would be incorporated into the inside of the ICM with the EPI or be sequestered to the outside of the ICM, we injected ES cells into the cavity of the early blastocyst (E3.25–E3.5) ( Figures 6 A and 6C). For both injection scenarios, we injected siNC, siERM, or siACTN4 treated ES cells and then assessed the cultured blastocyst at ∼E4.0 ( Figures 6 B and 6C), by which time injected control ES cells should populate the EPI ( Alexandrova et al., 2016 1. Alexandrova, S. ∙ Kalkan, T. ∙ Humphreys, P. ... Selection and dynamics of embryonic stem cell integration into early mouse embryos Development. 2016; 143 :24-34 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we found that for both 8-cell embryo and blastocyst injection, siNC cells were primarily situated in the sorted EPI. In contrast, we found that a significant fraction of both siERM and siACTN4 cells, in both injection scenarios, were integrated in the ICM, but in the outer layer corresponding to PrE localization adjacent to the blastocoel ( Figures 6 B–6D; Table S2 ). Importantly, the ES cells localized on the outside were expressing EPI marker Oct4 but not the early PrE lineage marker Sox17, so these perturbations are affecting positioning but not fate ( Video S7 ). Thus, ES cells displaying enhanced surface fluctuations displayed disrupted sorting when injected into the mouse embryo, strongly supporting our hypothesis that surface fluctuations promote physical sorting of early embryonic lineages.

Our experiments and CS3D model suggest that cell sorting in the ICM does not follow a classical “thermodynamic” picture of phase segregation in which cells would segregate due to differences in static mean cell-cell affinity to lower the total free energy of the system. Instead, our data suggest that differences in cell surface dynamics, which manifest as differential cell surface fluctuations, play a key role. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how differential surface fluctuations might physically drive the sorting of cells. Notably, surface fluctuations are an intrinsically out-of-equilibrium process. Recently, another non-equilibrium process grounded not in classical parameters such as differential cell adhesion or cell-cell affinity, but instead on differences in cell shape, has been proposed to give rise to local demixing in multicellular aggregates. This proposal was based on vertex models, which simulate the dynamic behavior of cell aggregates ( Farhadifar et al., 2007 21. Farhadifar, R. ∙ Röper, J.C. ∙ Aigouy, B. ... The influence of cell mechanics, cell-cell interactions, and proliferation on epithelial packing Curr. Biol. 2007; 17 :2095-2104 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (882) PubMed Google Scholar ). A key input parameter in vertex models is the “preferred” perimeter each cell would strive to attain at equilibrium. It is not always possible for each cell to reach this preferred shape, which generates mechanical frustration and prevents the system from settling into a unique ordered equilibrium state. Interestingly, simulations of two cell populations with different preferred perimeters showed local demixing, driven by a non-equilibrium process ( Sahu et al., 2020 75. Sahu, P. ∙ Sussman, D.M. ∙ Rübsam, M. ... Small-scale demixing in confluent biological tissues Soft Matter. 2020; 16 :3325-3337 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, more “fluid” cells (which possess large perimeters, or shape indices) can squeeze and diffuse through the tissue much more easily than the less fluid cells. Moreover, the more fluid cells are kinetically disfavored to penetrate clusters of more “solid” cells (which possess smaller shape indices). The uneven energy barriers that exist between cells of different shape indices promote demixing of the two populations ( Sahu et al., 2020 75. Sahu, P. ∙ Sussman, D.M. ∙ Rübsam, M. ... Small-scale demixing in confluent biological tissues Soft Matter. 2020; 16 :3325-3337 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, another modeling study has suggested that fluctuations could be related to tissue-level fluidity ( Bi et al., 2016 9. Bi, D. ∙ Yang, X. ∙ Marchetti, M.C. ... Motility-driven glass and jamming transitions in biological tissues Phys. Rev. X. 2016; 6 :021011 PubMed Google Scholar ); we thus speculated there may be a link between cell fluidity and surface fluctuations.
Given that pPrE and siACTN4 and siERM cells all display higher surface fluctuations inside of aggregates when they are mixed with their less active counterparts, we systematically measured the cell shape index for the more “active” cells in their respective aggregates. Strikingly, we observed in isolated ICMs that, even though pPrE and pEPI cells did not display significant differences in size (see STAR Methods ), the mean shape index of the pPrE cells was significantly higher than in pEPI cells. This result indicates that pPrE cells are not only a more active but also a more fluid population of cells ( Figure 7 A). Furthermore, we also found that the shape index was higher in siACTN4 and siERM cells than in their less active counterparts ( Figure 7 B). We then found, using vertex model simulations, that inputting the measured differences in shape index in a simulated 3D tissue gave rise to demixing ( Figure 7 C). Although this mode of demixing arising from shape differences has been shown to be only local and partial ( Sahu et al., 2020 75. Sahu, P. ∙ Sussman, D.M. ∙ Rübsam, M. ... Small-scale demixing in confluent biological tissues Soft Matter. 2020; 16 :3325-3337 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), the sorting in our 3D simulations occurs at the experimentally relevant length scales of the ICM.

Non-monotonic fluidization generated by fluctuating edge tensions in confluent tissues arXiv. 2020; arXiv:2008.13007 Google Scholar ), we next wondered if the fluid subtype in our model of demixing aggregates shows large surface tension variability. We therefore assessed, using vertex modeling, the variability in surface tensions (also called edge tensions in vertex models) that arise in a mixed population of more fluid (large shape index) and more solid (small shape index) cells. We found that the fluid cells do indeed have more variable surface tensions than the solid cells ( Figure 7 D, right). Moreover, they can display negative edge tensions ( Figure 7 D, left), which can arise in vertex models if adhesion forces are larger than tensile forces, and would lead to junctions tending to elongate rather than contract. A negative edge tension would tend to lead to bulging in the cells at junctions and potentially at free surfaces. Together, more variable surface tensions and the occurrence of negative tensions suggest a greater capacity for blebbing and surface fluctuations in general in more fluid cells ( Figure 7 D). This greater capacity for surface fluctuations provides an intriguing theoretical link between our two key phenomenological observables, cell fluidity and surface fluctuations.
We then reasoned that if there is a physical connection between cell shape and fluctuations, there ought to be a strong correlation in our cell data. To quantify this first in the ICM, we compared the variations in shape index (as a readout of fluctuations) with the shape index itself and found a strong correlation between the two ( Figure 7 E). Furthermore, consolidating all our data in ES cells and ICM, we found that the more “fluid” cells (upper half of the shape index distribution) displayed significantly higher fluctuations in shape index than the more “solid” cells (lower half of the shape index distribution) ( Figure 7 E bottom). Taking these data together with our simulation, we propose that there is a deep connection between the surface fluctuations we observe and cell fluidity. In summary, our data suggest that higher cell surface fluctuations are associated with higher cell fluidity, and that higher fluidity and surface fluctuations together lead to pPrE cells demixing from the more solid pEPI cell population.

Section: Discussion

There has been a growing consensus that spatial segregation of embryonic cell lineages is typically driven by cell-cell affinity asymmetries at cellular interfaces ( Amack and Manning, 2012 2.

Knowing the boundaries: extending the differential adhesion hypothesis in embryonic cell sorting Science. 2012; 338 :212-215 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chan et al., 2017 12.

Asymmetric division of contractile domains couples cell positioning and fate specification Nature. 2016; 536 :344-348 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ), though a recent report found spatial segregation with no clear affinity asymmetries ( Krens et al., 2017 42. Krens, S.F.G. ∙ Veldhuis, J.H. ∙ Barone, V. ... Interstitial fluid osmolarity modulates the action of differential tissue surface tension in progenitor cell segregation during gastrulation Development. 2017; 144 :1798-1806 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, our simulations suggest that for cell sorting to occur within a time frame relevant to development, a high degree of affinity asymmetry is required, which is not necessarily achieved for all embryonic tissues, including EPI and PrE in the mouse blastocyst. For our analysis, we chose the most extreme possible value of the difference in cell-cell affinity from our measurements to run our simulations. Thus, though we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that the small differential cell-cell affinity we observed leads to an “outside bias” for the PrE lineage, none of our measurements support differential cell-cell affinity as a driving force of sorting. Therefore, we conclude that difference in cell-cell affinity alone do not explain why PrE cells sort to the outside.
Our simulations and experimental models strongly suggest that it is not only average levels of cell surface mechanical factors, but also their dynamics and concomitant cell surface fluctuations, that are important for sorting ( Figure 7 F), contrasting with classical models for the phase separation of binary cellular mixtures ( Graner and Glazier, 1992 29. Graner, F. ∙ Glazier, J.A. Simulation of biological cell sorting using a two-dimensional extended Potts model Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 69 :2013-2016 Crossref Scopus (991) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on minimization of an effective energy. These cell surface fluctuations manifest differently depending on whether cells have a free surface or if they are immersed in the bulk of a multicellular aggregate. With a free surface, fluctuations primarily appear as blebs, but within the bulk they appear as shape fluctuations. It is likely that the many of the same dynamical mechanical instabilities are responsible for both these manifestations of surface fluctuations.
Our work suggests at least two areas of future work. First, how are cell surface fluctuations molecularly regulated? Our data imply that ERM-regulated effective membrane tension, a key regulator of cell surface fluctuations, could be a pivotal and previously overlooked player in tissue sorting. Indeed, changing ERM levels resulted in fluctuations that directly affected sorting both in cell aggregates ( Figures 5 D and 5E) and embryos ( Figure 6 ). On the other hand, it is unlikely that surface fluctuations arise from the activity of a single mechanical regulator; indeed, it is likely that mechanical regulators such as ERM and ACTN4 are part of a larger network of mechanical regulators that control the level of surface fluctuations. Given that our data also suggest that the enhanced surface fluctuations in the PrE lineage are propelled by FGF signaling, it is plausible that the changes we see in mechanical factors are part of a larger network of changes in intracellular signaling connected to the emerging identity of the PrE lineage. Notably, ERMs are also involved in polarity establishment, and polarity has been shown to crucially contribute to PrE lineage specification and positioning ( Bassalert et al., 2018 7. Bassalert, C. ∙ Valverde-Estrella, L. ∙ Chazaud, C. Primitive endoderm differentiation: from specification to epithelialization Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2018; 128 :81-104 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gerbe et al., 2008 27. Gerbe, F. ∙ Cox, B. ∙ Rossant, J. ...

Atypical protein kinase C couples cell sorting with primitive endoderm maturation in the mouse blastocyst Development. 2013; 140 :4311-4322 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2002 89. Suzuki, A. ∙ Ishiyama, C. ∙ Hashiba, K. ... aPKC kinase activity is required for the asymmetric differentiation of the premature junctional complex during epithelial cell polarization J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 :3565-3573 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). At this point, how polarity is connected to a mechanical mechanism of sorting is unknown; nevertheless, there is extensive cross-talk between polarity signals and regulators of cell mechanics, such as Rho GTPases ( Iden and Collard, 2008 37. Iden, S. ∙ Collard, J.G. Crosstalk between small GTPases and polarity proteins in cell polarization Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :846-859 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2017 99. Zhu, Meng ∙ Leung, Chuen Yan ∙ Shahbazi, Marta N. ... Actomyosin polarisation through PLC-PKC triggers symmetry breaking of the mouse embryo Nat Commun. 2017; 8 :921 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the increased surface fluctuations we observe might be the mechanical signature of nascent polarity. Importantly, however, the mechanical mechanism of sorting we propose does not require polarity. Instead, our model and experiments point to an initial sorting mechanism purely driven by differences in surface fluctuations and cell fluidity. Future work will be needed to disentangle the how different molecular players, including polarity factors and actin cortex regulators, control heterogeneities in membrane tension and the degree of cell fluidity in the developing embryo.
The second open question concerns the relationship between cell surface fluctuations and preferred cell shape (a classical measure of local tissue fluidity; Bi et al., 2015 8. Bi, D. ∙ Lopez, J.H. ∙ Schwarz, J.M. ... A density-independent rigidity transition in biological tissues Nat. Phys. 2015; 11 :1074-1079 Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar ; Park et al., 2015 65. Park, J.A. ∙ Kim, J.H. ∙ Bi, D. ... Unjamming and cell shape in the asthmatic airway epithelium Nat. Mater. 2015; 14 :1040-1048 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ). Though it is not yet possible to establish if there is a hierarchy between cell surface fluctuations and cell shape and fluidity, our work suggests that that preferred shape and fluctuations are likely intrinsically coupled. Indeed, our vertex model simulations suggest that the subtype with higher cell fluidity also has higher variations in cell surface tensions and can display negative surface tensions, which could favor cell surface deformations such as blebbing. Future studies could explore the relationship between fluctuations and cell shape and will require new modeling frameworks. Indeed, at this point, vertex modeling does not implement boundary conditions such as fluid interfaces in small systems such as small cell aggregates or the ICM ( Sahu et al., 2020 75. Sahu, P. ∙ Sussman, D.M. ∙ Rübsam, M. ... Small-scale demixing in confluent biological tissues Soft Matter. 2020; 16 :3325-3337 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Sussman et al., 2018 88. Sussman, D.M. ∙ Schwarz, J.M. ∙ Marchetti, M.C. ... Soft yet Sharp interfaces in a vertex model of confluent tissue Phys. Rev. Lett. 2018; 120 :058001 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ); in contrast, such boundary conditions are readily implemented with particle-based models such as CS3D. Such an extension to vertex modeling could particularly help to understand how local demixing via differential cell shape/fluidity could result in a cell population specifically located at the boundary of an aggregate, with another more biased toward the aggregate core.
In summary, in this work, we propose a mechanism to explain spatial segregation in tissue based not on differences in static mechanical properties alone but relying instead on dynamical, non-equilibrium mechanisms. Such fluctuation-driven sorting could represent a broadly applicable sorting principle across species and tissues. Ultimately, our discovery that the differences in noise at cell surfaces and interfaces, or surface fluctuations, regulate the mechanical sorting of lineages in the mouse blastocyst provides insight into tissue self-organization in the early embryo. The fluctuation mechanism we propose here is likely linked to cell and tissue fluidization, which has been proposed to facilitate tissue morphogenesis. It will be interesting to investigate how cell surface dynamics influence other processes of self-organization across organisms, including tissue morphogenesis and tumorigenesis.
We have identified several limitations in our study. First, the link between cell fluidity and fluctuations is correlative and thus currently somewhat speculative. Developing a means to incorporate tensional fluctuations will help to clarify this link in the future. Second, we have not yet identified a molecular mechanism to explain how the differences in cell surface fluctuations between pPrE and pEPI cells arise. Likewise, we have not identified how FGF signaling leads to greater surface fluctuations. Finally, given that perturbing cell surface fluctuations directly in the embryo is likely to influence lineage choice, we used chimeras incorporating embryonic stem cells as an experimental model to show that cell surface fluctuations influence sorting in vivo . Even though embryonic stem cells will contribute to embryonic tissue after injection, we are not perturbing cells native to the embryo and are thus not precisely modeling the cell-sorting process in vivo . All of these limitations could be addressed with their own studies and point toward interesting future work that would extend our findings.

CD-1 embryos were used for the injection experiments. All embryos used in this study were obtained from natural mating. Embryo staging was based on the assumption that, on average, mating occurred at midnight so that at midday, the embryos were assigned E0.5. Embryos were flushed at the relevant stages from oviducts (eight-cell stage embryos) or uterine horns (blastocysts) using flushing and holding media (M2, Sigma). PrE cells can be visualised with Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ reporter which we used as additional criteria to classify embryo stages ( Grabarek et al., 2012 28. Grabarek, J.B. ∙ Żyżyńska, K. ∙ Saiz, N. ...

EPI and PrE have not segregated at E3.5 - E3.75 stages. EPI and PrE have segregated at E4.0 - E4.5. GFP positive PrE were clearly seen to form one layer faced with a blastocoel. The sex of embryos and the ages of mice using mating were not concerned in this study. The mice were maintained in a state-of-the-art biofacility with daily health checks carried out by dedicated trained staff. The mice were maintained on a lighting regime of 12:12 hours light:dark with food and water supplied ad libitum.

ES cell lines are listed in the key resources table . ES cells were routinely maintained on 0.1% gelatine (Sigma)-coated 6-well plates (Falcon) in 2i+LIF media ( Ying et al., 2008 98.

Cells were passaged every three days, using Accutase disassociation (PAA). N2B27 media were prepared as described ( Ying et al., 2008 98. Ying, Q.L. ∙ Wray, J. ∙ Nichols, J. ...

Briefly, 1:1 Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F-12; Sigma) and Neurobasal media (Gibco), N2 (in-house) and B27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) additives, 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) were supplemented. Cells were cultured without antibiotics and tested negative for mycoplasma by periodic PCR screening.
tdTomato ES cells were generated from the embryo crossed Gt(Rosa)26Sor tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze mice (JAX#007909 [ Madisen et al., 2010 50. Madisen, L. ∙ Zwingman, T.A. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ...

For H2B-BFP ES cells generation, 0.8 μg of pPB-CAG-H2B-BFP-IRES-Neo (kindly gifted by M Kinoshita) and 0.4 μg of pPy-CGA-PBase were transfected into E14Tg2A (E14) ES cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following the drug selection with 400 μg/ml G418 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), BFP-positive colonies were picked and expanded.

Niwa) using In-Fusion (Clontech) to generate pPB-Tet-CA-EZR. 0.8 μg of pPB-Tet- CA-EZR was transfected with 0.8 μg of pPB-CAG-rtTA-IRES-Neo (kindly gifted by A Smith [Addgene plasmid #60612] [ Takashima et al., 2014 90. Takashima, Y. ∙ Guo, G. ∙ Loos, R. ... Resetting transcription factor control circuitry toward ground-state pluripotency in human Cell. 2014; 158 :1254-1269 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (692) PubMed Google Scholar ]) and 0.4 μg of pPy-CGA-PBase using Lipofectamine 2000 into E14 ES cells. The cells were harvested from a 0.1% gelatine-coated 6-well plate in 2i+LIF. After 48 hours, 400 μg/ml G418 was added to ES cells and colonies were selected. After one week of G418 selection, clones were manually picked, dissociated, then split into a 96-well plate (Corning). ES cells were cultured with 2i+LIF in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml Dox (Sigma). Clones that with no mCherry signal in the absence of Dox and high mCherry signal in the presence of Dox were chosen by eyes.
Embryo and cell manipulations were carried out under a dissecting microscope (Leica Microsystems). The zona pellucida was removed using acid Tyrode’s solution (Sigma). Blastocysts from E3.5-E4.5 were subjected to immunosurgery as previously described ( Solter and Knowles, 1975 83. Solter, D. ∙ Knowles, B.B. Immunosurgery of mouse blastocyst Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72 :5099-5102 Crossref Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, blastocysts were incubated for 45-60 minutes in a 1:5 dilution of anti-mouse rabbit serum (Sigma) in N2B27, washed in N2B27 and further incubated for 30-60 minutes in a 1:5 dilution of rat serum (in-house) in N2B27 for the complement reaction. The ICM was subsequently cleaned from residual trophectoderm with a narrowly fitting glass pipette. Single-cell dissociation of ICMs was performed in a 1:1 mixture of Accutase and 0.025% trypsin (Invitrogen) plus 1% chick serum (Sigma). Cells were dissociated by repetitive using blunted microcapillaries (Global Scientific or Harvard apparatus) and washed in Blast (Origio) or N2B27.
Embryos and isolated ICMs were cultured in Blast, KSOM (Millipore) or N2B27 in an organ culture dish (Falcon) culture or in single-drop cultures under mineral oil (Sigma) in a humidified incubator at 37 ° C with 5% CO 2 . Embryo culture media were buffered in the incubation chamber for at least 30 minutes before embryos and ICM culture.
Isolated ICMs were transferred to an embryo immobilization chip (Dolomite Centre Ltd). The spinning disk microscope (Andor Revolution XD System [ANDOR] with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope [Nikon]) was used for taking images. 17 z-stacks per time step every 30 minutes were taken, with three channels (488 nm excitation for Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ reporter, 561 nm excitation for membrane [mTmG] and bright field). An Andor 85 camera recorded images with magnification through a CFI Plan Fluor ×40/1.3 oil objective (Nikon) with Cargille microscope immersion oil (Cargille Labs). Each experiment was set up using Andor IQ Software. Each image collected data in 502 × 501 (width × height) pixels. The microscope is equipped with an incubation chamber to keep the sample at 37°C and 7% CO 2 . Images were processed using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 80. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40013) PubMed Google Scholar ).
EPI and PrE cells’ sizes were measured using the images from the middle plane of the cells. For E3.5 cells, six EPI and six PrE cells were measured. For 3.75 cells, 21 pEPI and 22 pPrE cells were measured. For E4.5 cells, ten EPI and eight PrE cells were measured.
Embryos and isolated ICMs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Sigma) at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then, the samples were rinsed in PBS containing 3 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone (PBS/PVP; Sigma), permeabilised with PBS/PVP containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes. Blocking was performed with an embryo blocking buffer comprising PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma), 0.01% Tween20 (Sigma) and 2% donkey serum (Sigma) at 4 ° C for 2-3 hours. Primary antibodies were diluted in an embryo blocking buffer, and samples were incubated with the antibody solution at 4 ° C overnight. They were rinsed three times in an embryo blocking buffer for 15 minutes ∼ each. Secondary antibodies were diluted in an embryo blocking buffer with or without 500 ng/ml 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen), and samples were incubated in the appropriate antibody solution at room temperature for one hour in the dark. They were rinsed three times in an embryo blocking buffer for 15 minutes ∼ each, then transferred in small drops of blocking buffer on a poly-D-lysine (PDL, Millipore) coated glass-bottom dish under the mineral oil and taken images. For the coating, the dishes were coated with small drops of 50 μg/ml PDL for at least one hour at room temperature. The drops were washed three times with the media used for imaging and covered with mineral oil. Otherwise, the samples were incubated briefly in increasing concentrations of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) before mounting on glass slides in small drops of concentrated Vectashield. Subsequently, coverslips with Vaseline spacer were mounted and sealed with nail varnish. Whole staining process was performed on Pyrex 9 depression spot plate (Corning).
For pERM staining, pEPI and pPrE cells seeded on a PDL-coated 10-well slide glass (TF1006, MTSUNAMI) were fixed with 4% PFA in cytoskeletal stabilizing buffer (CSB; 10 mM MES pH6.1, 138 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA) containing 4.5% w/v sucrose (Sigma) and 0.2% Triton X-100 at 37 ° C for six minutes. Subsequently, the samples were fixed with 4% PFA in CSB containing 4.5% w/v sucrose at 37 ° C for 14 minutes. The fixation buffers were pre-warmed at 37 ° C before use. Then, the samples were rinsed in PBS for twice, permeabilised with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X at room temperature for ten minutes. Blocking was performed with a buffer comprising PBS containing 2% FBS, 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton-X at room temperature for 45 minutes. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer, and samples were rinsed with the appropriate antibody solution once and incubated with the antibody solution at 4 ° C overnight. They were rinsed five times using PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X for five minutes ∼ each. Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer, and samples were incubated in the appropriate antibody solution at room temperature for one hour in the dark. They were rinsed five times in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X for five minutes ∼ each. 10 μl of Vectashield was added to each well, and coverslips were mounted and sealed with nail varnish. For pMRLC staining, cells were fixed and stained in a similar manner to pERM staining. PBS containing 1% BSA and 10% donkey serum was utilised for blocking buffer. Primary and secondary antibodies were listed in key resources table .
For embryos, isolated ICMs, ICM cells, ES cells imaging, samples were transferred to the drops on PDL-coated glass-bottom dishes and taken images using a Leica TCS SP5, Leica Stellaris or ZEISS LSM980 confocal microscope. For live imaging of ICM aggregates, doublets of ICM cells and ES cells, SP5 was used with an incubation chamber to keep the sample at 37°C and 7% CO 2 . For the quantification of fluorescence in single cells, a set of experiment images were acquired using the same microscope with the same setting on the same day. Images were then segmented to isolate the signal and mean intensity was found using Fiji.
Three E3.75 Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ positive embryos obtained from intercrossing of Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ and F1 hybrids were used. We collected embryos, which had salt-and-pepper GFP positive cells distribution in ICM and proper GFP intensity. ICM cells were dissociated from isolated ICM by immunosurgery. Dissociated single cells were transferred immediately into Smart-Seq2 single-cell lysis buffer and immediately frozen on dry ice. Smart-Seq2 library was prepared as originally described ( Picelli et al., 2014 66. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, A.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (2542) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 8-well strips containing isolated single nuclei in lysis buffer were thawed, and reverse transcription using Superscript II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with olig-dT30-VN and TSO primers and PCR using KAPA Hifi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa) with ISPCR primer. Following RT-PCR, clean up with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) was carried out. The Nextera XT DNA library prep kit (Illumina) was used for subsequent sample preparation. The samples were subjected to a tagmentation reaction, indexing and PCR amplified. Libraries were then mixed and purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Ready DNA libraries were quality controlled using Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (150 base, paired end).

Toribio, A.L. ∙ Alako, B. ∙ Amid, C. ... European nucleotide archive in 2016 Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D32-D36 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mus musculus GRCm38.87 gene annotation was used together with mm10 genome version. Alignments to gene loci were quantified with htseq-count ( Anders et al., 2015 3. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq—a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (13514) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on annotation from Ensembl 87. Sequencing libraries with fewer than 500K mapped reads were excluded from subsequent analyses. Read distribution bias across gene bodies was computed as the ratio between the total read spanning the 50th to the 100th percentile of gene length, and those between the first and 49th. Samples with ratio >1.5 were not considered further. Stage-specific outliers were screened by principal component analysis.
Principal component and cluster analyses were performed based on log 2 fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments (log 2 FPKM) values computed with the Bioconductor packages DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 49. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48497) PubMed Google Scholar ), Sincell ( Juliá et al., 2015 38.

Sincell: an R/Bioconductor package for statistical assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell RNA-seq Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3380-3382 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) or FactoMineR in addition to custom scripts. Differential expression analysis was performed with scde ( Kharchenko et al., 2014 39. Kharchenko, P.V. ∙ Silberstein, L. ∙ Scadden, D.T. Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :740-742 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ), which fits individual error models for the assessment of differential expression between sample groups. Pseudotimes were computed using R monocle package ( Trapnell et al., 2014 94. Trapnell, C. ∙ Cacchiarelli, D. ∙ Grimsby, J. ... The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (3557) PubMed Google Scholar ). For global analyses, genes that registered zero counts in all single-cell samples in a given comparison were omitted. Euclidean distance and average agglomeration methods were used for cluster analyses. Expression data are available upon request. Ensembl 87 annotation was used to download specific actin cytoskeletal genes using biological process name as a keyword.
Gene exhibiting the greatest expression variability (and thus contributing substantial discriminatory power) were identified by fitting a non-linear regression curve between average log 2 FPKM and the square of the coefficient of variation. Thresholds were applied along the x -axis (average log 2 FPKM) and y -axis (log squared coefficient of variation [CV 2 ]) to identify the most variable genes. As actin-cytoskeleton-related genes, we selected 6899 genes ( Table S1 ). Amongst them, 152 genes were highly modulated in ICM cells through E3.5 to E4.5 blastocysts and use these genes for actin-cytoskeleton related genes principal component and cluster analyses ( Figure 1 E; Table S1 ).
E3.75 Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ positive embryos obtained from intercrossing of Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ and CD-1 or F1 hybrid were used. Isolated single ICM cells in Blast medium containing 1:10000 CellMask Orange (Life Technologies) were loaded into the BSA coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) confinement devices with a fixed roof height of 8 μm, 9 μm or 10 μm. Confinement devices were designed to restrict cells between two glass plates, trapping the cells in the z -direction but allowing free movement in x - and y -direction, as first demonstrated in ( Le Berre et al., 2014 44. Le Berre, M. ∙ Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz, E. ∙ Bonazzi, D. ... Methods for two-dimensional cell confinement Methods Cell Biol. 2014; 121 :213-229 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). To adapt the device for the use with very small cell numbers, we modified confinement channels as described in Heuzé et al. (2011) 35. Heuzé, M.L. ∙ Collin, O. ∙ Terriac, E. ... Cell migration in confinement: a micro-channel-based assay Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 769 :415-434 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar by replacing the channels with pillars to create a constant, well-defined roof height. Live imaging of the cells was performed with a 6x silicon objective (UPLSAPO60XS, Olympus) on an inverted microscope (Olympus FV1200) equipped with a humidified chamber at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The bright field, GFP, and CellMask images of the cells were taken every one, two or three minutes for up to ten hours.
E3.75 Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ embryos obtained from intercrossing of Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ and F1 hybrids were used. Isolated ICM cells were transferred to single-drop of N2B27 in a glass-bottom dish (FluoroDish, World Precision Instruments) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . 2 ml M2 in the presence of 0.01% CellMask Deep Red Plasma membrane Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the dish. The mean GFP intensity of Pdgfra H2B-GFP was used to classify ICM cells’ lineage and cell cycle stage. Mitotic cells and dead cells were excluded from the analysis. Samples were measured for no longer than two hours.
For ES cells, H2B-BFP or CA-EZR cells were seeded on 0.1% gelatine-coated 6-well plates in 2i+LIF at 2.0×10 4 cells, and the media was changed to 2i+LIF with or without 1μg Dox following day. The following day, cells were detached using Accutase and suspended in 2i+LIF. Suspended cells were centrifuged at 1400 rpm for three minutes, pelleted, re-suspended in 2i+LIF in the presence of 0.01% CellMask Green Plasma Membrane Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and added to a PDL-coated glass-bottom dish. The cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Mitotic cells and dead cells were excluded from the analysis. Samples were measured for no longer than 50 minutes.
pEPI and pPrE tension measurements were performed using a JPK CellHesion (JPK Instruments) mounted on an IX81 inverted confocal microscope (Olympus). Tipless silicon cantilevers (ARROW-TL1Au-50) were chosen with a nominal spring constant of 0.03 N/m. Sensitivity was calibrated by acquiring a force curve on a glass coverslip. Spring constant was calibrated by the thermal noise fluctuation method. Z -length parameter and setpoint force were set at 30 μm and 10 nN, respectively. Constant height mode was selected. The measurement was carried on by lowering the tipless cantilever onto an empty area next to a target cell. Once the cantilever retracted (by roughly 30 μm), it was positioned above the target cell and run a compression for 200 seconds. During the constant height compression, the force acting on the cantilever was recorded. After initial force relaxation, the resulting force value was used to extract surface tension. A confocal stack was acquired using an Olympus UPLANSAPO ×60/1.35 NA oil immersion objective (Olympus).
ES cells tension measurements were performed using a JPK CellHesion 200 (Bruker Corporation) and a DSD2 Differential Spinning Disk (Andor) both mounted on a DMi8 inverted microscope (Leica). Tipless silicon cantilevers (ARROW-TL1-50) were chosen with a nominal spring constant of 0.03 N/m. Sensitivity was calibrated by acquiring a force curve on glass. Spring constant was calibrated by the thermal noise fluctuation method. Z -length parameter and setpoint force were set at 80 μm and 4 nN, respectively. Constant height mode was selected. The measurement was carried on by lowering the tipless cantilever onto an empty area next to a target cell. Once the cantilever retracted (by roughly 80 μm), it was positioned above the target cell and a compression was run for 50 seconds. During the constant height compression, the force acting on the cantilever was recorded. After initial force relaxation, the resulting force value was used to extract surface tension. A confocal stack was acquired using a ×40/1.1 NA water immersion objective (Leica).
The calculation of cortex tension (T) is based on Fischer-Friedrich et al. (2014) 24. Fischer-Friedrich, E. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ∙ Jülicher, F. ... Quantification of surface tension and internal pressure generated by single mitotic cells Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :6213 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ( Equation 2 ). Briefly, neglecting the angle of the cantilever with respect to the dish (∼8°) for pPrE and pEPI tension measurements, to the dish (∼10°) for pPrE and pEPI tension measurements and assuming negligible adhesion between cell, dish and cantilever, the force balance at the contact point reads: T = F ⁢ ( 𝑟 2 m i d 𝑟 2 c − 1 ) 2 ⁢ π ⁢ 𝑟 m i d (Equation 2) where r mid is the radius of maximum cross-sectional area of the selected cell, r c is the radius of contact area between cell and cantilever and F is the resulting force exerted by the cell on the cantilever. To avoid errors due to direct measurement of r c , the contact radius was calculated using the following Equation 3 ( Stewart et al., 2012 85. Stewart, M.P. ∙ Toyoda, Y. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Tracking mechanics and volume of globular cells with atomic force microscopy using a constant-height clamp Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :143-154 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ): 𝐴 c = 𝐴 m i d − ( π 4 ) ⁢ h 2 c e l l (Equation 3) where A c is the contact area between cell and cantilever, A mid is the cell maximum cross-sectional area and h cell is the cell height. h cell was calculated as described ( Stewart et al., 2012 85. Stewart, M.P. ∙ Toyoda, Y. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Tracking mechanics and volume of globular cells with atomic force microscopy using a constant-height clamp Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :143-154 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) from the radius, force and cantilever height during compression. The cantilever height during compression was obtained by subtracting the cantilever height difference on glass and the cantilever height difference during cell compression. For pPrE and pEPI tension measurements, h cell values were confirmed by CellMask TM Deep Red membrane confocal stack reconstruction (corrected for optical aberration) ( Chugh et al., 2017 15. Chugh, P. ∙ Clark, A.G. ∙ Smith, M.B. ... Actin cortex architecture regulates cell surface tension Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19 :689-697 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ; Diaspro et al., 2002 19. Diaspro, A. ∙ Federici, F. ∙ Robello, M. Influence of refractive-index mismatch in high-resolution three-dimensional confocal microscopy Appl. Opt. 2002; 41 :685-690 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hell et al., 1993 34. Hell, S. ∙ Reiner, G. ∙ Cremer, C. ... Aberrations in confocal fluorescence microscopy induced by mismatches in refractive index J. Microsc. 1993; 169 :391-405 Crossref Scopus (573) Google Scholar ). For the ES cell analysis, some of the shapes were difficult to approximate leading to difficulties estimating the radius, leading in turn to abnormally high surface tension measurements. We performed a boxplot analysis with a whisker size of 1.5 to remove those outliers, which were scattered across all groups and represented less than 10% of the overall measurements.
E3.75 Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ positive embryos obtained from intercrossing of Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ and F1 hybrids were used. Two isolated single ICM cells were put together by gently blowing the surrounding medium through a microcapillary in the micro drop of Blast under the mineral oil and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . When two isolated ICM cells come into contact, the contact grows until equilibrium is attained. Doublets were transferred in Blast drop in the presence of 0.01% CellMask TM Deep Red Plasma membrane Stain to visualise membrane under the mineral oil in a glass-bottom dish (MatTek) coated with PDL (see Figure S2 I). Before transferring doublets to Blast drop, the drops under mineral oil were buffered in the incubation chamber for at least 30 minutes. Confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 (Leica Microsystems) confocal microscope. Optical section thickness was 0.99 μm. A HC PL APO 40×/1.30 Oil CS2 (Leica) with immersion oil (Leica) was used. Whole doublet images from bottom to top were taken with three channels (488 nm excitation for Pdgfra H2B-GFP reporter, 647 nm excitation for membrane [CellMask TM Deep Red Plasma membrane Stain] and bright field). The microscope is equipped with an incubation chamber to keep the sample at 37°C and 7% CO 2 .
CA-EZR-IRES-mCherry were seeded on 0.1% gelatine coated 6-well plates for 24 hours in N2B27+2i+LIF at a density of 2 × 10 4 cells/cm 2 before addition of 1μg/ml Dox in N2B27+2i+LIF to one well whilst leaving another well without Dox as control for further 24 hours. The following day, cells were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using Accutase and suspended in 500 μl each culture media with 0.01% CellMask TM Green Plasma membrane Stain and Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cell suspension was seeded on PDL-coated dishes and incubated at 37 ° C 5% CO 2 for 30 minutes to allow doublet formation before live imaging.
The external contact angles at the middle section of the doublets were measured by using the angle tool of Fiji. The average of both sides of the external contact angles was used as the external contact angle θ e . The contact size was measured by drawling a segment along the waist of the doublet and measuring the length of the segment using Fiji. The mean GFP intensity of Pdgfra H2B-GFP was quantified using Fiji and used to classify the lineage of each ICM cell. The top and bottom 40% of cells with strong GFP intensities (GFP high cells and GFP low cells) were considered as pPrE cells and pEPI cells, respectively, and used for this analysis. The doublets that were not horizontal to the dish, mitotic cells, dead cells and blebbing cells at the interface were excluded from the analysis.
Simulation results in this work were produced by the cell sorting in 3D (CS3D, http://github.com/chris-revell/SEM ) model. The full explanation and theoretical foundations of this model are contained in references ( Revell, 2018 71. Revell, C. Modelling Physical Mechanisms Driving Tissue Self-Organisation in the Early Mammalian Embryo University of Cambridge, 2018 Google Scholar ; Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, CS3D is an extension of the Subcellular Element Method ( Newman, 2007 60. Newman, T.J. Modeling multicellular structures using the subcellular element model Single-Cell-Based Models in Biology and Medicine Birkhäuser, 2007; 221-239 Crossref Google Scholar ), a force-based technique for modelling the development of multicellular tissues. It allows us to study the effects of complex inter- and intra-cell features on tissue-scale dynamics ( Sandersius and Newman, 2008 79. Sandersius, S.A. ∙ Newman, T.J. Modeling cell rheology with the subcellular element model Phys. Biol. 2008; 5 :015002 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each individual cell is modelled as a group of infinitesimal elements, interacting via nearest-neighbour forces ( Figure 1 of Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ) defined by Morse potentials ( Morse, 1929 58. Morse, P.M. Diatomic molecules according to the wave mechanics. II. Vibrational levels Phys. Rev. 1929; 34 :57-64 Crossref Scopus (3362) Google Scholar ). Nearest-neighbour elements of different cells interact by the same mechanism. This model produces a fine-grained representation of multicellular systems incorporating both inter- and intra-cellular mechanisms. We implemented a simple algorithm for identifying boundary elements in each cell ( Revell, 2018 71. Revell, C. Modelling Physical Mechanisms Driving Tissue Self-Organisation in the Early Mammalian Embryo University of Cambridge, 2018 Google Scholar ) and used a Delaunay triangulation ( Delaunay, 1934 18. Delaunay, B. Sur la sphere vide Izvestia Akademii Nauk SSSR (Otdelenie Matematicheskikh I Estestvennykh Nauk), 1934 793-800 Google Scholar ; Renka, 1997 70. Renka, R.J. Algorithm 772: STRIPACK: Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram on the surface of a sphere ACM Trans. Math. Software (TOMS). 1997; 23 :416-434 Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar ) over this set of elements to define a nearest neighbour network across the cell boundary. By applying a constant force between these neighbouring elements in the triangulation, we modelled cell cortical tension. The magnitude of tension forces defined within the Delaunay triangulation can vary locally across the cell surface at interfaces with surfaces of other cells. We define a cell-cell interface by identifying and labeling the cortex elements that share adhesive inter-cell interactions with cortex elements of another cell ( Figure 1 of Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ).
The theoretical foundations of CS3D are explained in reference ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ), particularly section A of the Supplement of that reference, and the parameters used in the simulation are listed in the Tables in section B of the Supplement for reference ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, parameters such as cell-cell adhesion, intefacial tension and cell stiffness are relative measurements, chosen with reference to ‘stiffness_factor’ listed in the table in Section B of reference ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). The ‘stiffness_factor’ was parameterized in the initial subcellular element method and was validated by comparison to the viscoelasticity of living cells ( Sandersius and Newman, 2008 79. Sandersius, S.A. ∙ Newman, T.J. Modeling cell rheology with the subcellular element model Phys. Biol. 2008; 5 :015002 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). We parameterized the surface mechanics in CS3D by ensuring that the contact area of a doublet scaled with cell-cell affinity in agreement with the linear force balance model demonstrated in reference ( Maître et al., 2012 51. Maître, J.L. ∙ Berthoumieux, H. ∙ Krens, S.F.G. ... Adhesion functions in cell sorting by mechanically coupling the cortices of adhering cells Science. 2012; 338 :253-256 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this way, for the modelling results of this paper, we chose a cortical tension of surface tensions ( γ cm ) = 1.4 (as in Figure 2 A) and an adhesion strength A M = 0.3 . The full explanation and justification for the variables and parameters we used in the model are in reference ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ), particularly Figure 2 . All other parameters tested for the purposes of the current work, including affinity parameter and surface fluctuations, are explicitly stated within the text and/or figures.
Importantly, in Figure 4 of Revell et al. (2019) 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar , reproduced at right, we show that analysis of doublet contact areas between cell types is a nearly perfect predictor of sorting in a multicellular aggregate, regardless of the underlying forces that gives rise to that contact area. Cell-cell affinity, as measured by contact area, is a result of a balance between cell-cell adhesion, cortical tension, and interfacial cortical tension. A number of experimental and theoretical studies ( Amack and Manning, 2012 2. Amack, J.D. ∙ Manning, M.L. Knowing the boundaries: extending the differential adhesion hypothesis in embryonic cell sorting Science. 2012; 338 :212-215 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chan et al., 2017 12. Chan, E.H. ∙ Chavadimane Shivakumar, P.C. ∙ Clément, R. ... Patterned cortical tension mediated by N-cadherin controls cell geometric order in the Drosophila eye Elife. 2017; 6 :33420 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ; Maître et al., 2012 51. Maître, J.L. ∙ Berthoumieux, H. ∙ Krens, S.F.G. ... Adhesion functions in cell sorting by mechanically coupling the cortices of adhering cells Science. 2012; 338 :253-256 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 53. Maître, J.L. ∙ Niwayama, R. ∙ Turlier, H. ... Pulsatile cell-autonomous contractility drives compaction in the mouse embryo Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :849-855 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ) have shown that cell-cell affinity, not adhesion, cortical tension, or interfacial tension, is the relevant mechanical parameter to consider when studying sorting. To produce the results at right, we used the same CS3D model utilised in the current manuscript to study the relationship between cell-cell affinity and sorting. We varied cell-cell adhesion, interfacial tension and cortical tension differently across two different types of cells. Then a virtual doublet was modelled for each type of cell, and the contact area was found. The x-axis at right represents the absolute value of the difference in contact area for each cell. Then a virtual aggregate of 10 cells was modelled with the two types of cells using the same set of mechanical parameters used for the virtual doublet, then evolved to 50 cells. The y-axis represents the sorting index given the chosen mechanical parameters. Each coloured dot in the plot at right represents a different combination of mechanical parameters for each cell, defined fully in Reference ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, we found a striking degree of correlation between the cell-cell affinity and sorting index, suggesting that regardless of the underlying forces, cell-cell affinity is a very good predictor of cell sorting.
Given the excellent correlation between cell-cell affinity and cell sorting regardless of the underlying forces, we made a simplifying assumption that both cell types have the same cortical tension and the same adhesion magnitude (approximated as 0.2 γ cm as inspired by references ( Chan et al., 2017 12. Chan, E.H. ∙ Chavadimane Shivakumar, P.C. ∙ Clément, R. ... Patterned cortical tension mediated by N-cadherin controls cell geometric order in the Drosophila eye Elife. 2017; 6 :33420 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ; Maître et al., 2012 51. Maître, J.L. ∙ Berthoumieux, H. ∙ Krens, S.F.G. ... Adhesion functions in cell sorting by mechanically coupling the cortices of adhering cells Science. 2012; 338 :253-256 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar ), where γ cm is the cortical tension), and the only parameter that was varied was interfacial tension. We further demonstrated in reference ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ) that the only value that played a role in sorting was the ratio between the interfacial tensions of EPI::EPI and PrE::PrE and not the absolute values. Thus, EPI::EPI interfacial tension was a variable, and the affinity parameter, β , was calculated accordingly using Equation 1 in the text. The median values of pEPI and pPrE cell’s external contact angle are used to estimate the dimensionless parameter β given by Equation 1 in the text.
We model surface fluctuations, ε , as a local change in the cortical tension resulting in a protrusion from the cell surface. To achieve this, we devised a simple algorithm demonstrated in ( Figure 1 of Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). Each cortex element on the surface of a cell is given a randomly allocated phase φ , which increases linearly with time. This phase is used to determine the strength of cortex forces experienced by the cortex element, which vary sinusoidally with a period of 𝜏 / 1 0 where τ is the cell cycle time. Thus, the force experienced by the element from any cortical tension interaction is modulated by a term, δ ∗ s i n ⁡ ( 1 0 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝜏 + 𝜙 ) . A dimensionless parameter ε can be formed from the ratios of δ in pPrE to pEPI. This oscillation in tension at a particular point in the surface causes the element to protrude from the cell surface before being pulled back in, modelling a fluctuation. The behaviour of the system can be controlled by varying the surface fluctuation amplitude. The relevant parameter is the ratio of surface fluctuations of PrE to EPI, ε , which we calculated from experiments as ≈ 0.35 ( δ EPI = 1.39 μm, δ PrE = 1.91 μm).
Throughout each simulation, the extent of sorting was probed using a numerical sorting index ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). The sorting index is the ratio of the proportion of this area occupied by PrE cells to the total external surface area of the cell aggregate ( Figure 3 of Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). To provide context to the values obtained from the surface sorting measure, we implemented a randomised system normalisation ( Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). This algorithm randomly reallocates the fates of all cells in the system after each measurement, retaining the spatial arrangement and the number of each cell type, and repeats the measurement for each arrangement 100,000 times to obtain the mean and standard deviation of the measure across all randomised systems ( Figure 3 of Revell et al., 2019 72. Revell, C. ∙ Blumenfeld, R. ∙ Chalut, K.J. Force-based three-dimensional model predicts mechanical drivers of cell sorting Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286 :20182495 PubMed Google Scholar ). The system is then reverted to the original simulation state. We can then present the results of the simulation as a sorting index defined as SI = ( 𝑋 𝑆 − 𝜇 / 4 ⁢ 𝜎 ) . Each parameterisation of the model was tested four times for all results in the paper, and the mean and standard deviation for each run is reported.
In the simulation, we set pEPI and pPrE cells size (radius) as the same based on the measurement (E3.5 pEPI/ICM: 7.22±0.69, pPrE: 7.23±1.22, E3.75 pEPI: 7.13±1.31, pPrE: 7.27±1.19, E4.0 pEPI/EPI: 6.88±0.66, pPrE/PrE: 6.26±0.83). EPI and PrE in both a half embryo and a double embryo can sort similar to a normal size embryo indicating that the total number of ICM cells, at least from 0.5 to 2 times difference, doesn’t affect EPI and PrE segregation ( Saiz et al., 2016 77. Saiz, N. ∙ Williams, K.M. ∙ Seshan, V.E. ... Asynchronous fate decisions by single cells collectively ensure consistent lineage composition in the mouse blastocyst Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13463 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). We simulated up to 50 cells noting that the number of E3.5 ICM and E4.5 ICM is roughly 10-20 cells and 40-50 cells respectively. We approximated the proportion of both pEPI and pPrE as 50%.
Simulations were performed on the University of Cambridge Darwin HPC facility, running one simulation per core independently, using the Intel FORTRAN compiler.
mTmG +/- Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ positive embryos obtained from intercrossing of Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ and mTmG +/+ were used. For single ICM cell membrane dynamics study, isolated single ICM cells were transferred in the Blast drops under mineral oil on a PDL-coated glass-bottomed dish. The cells were kept for 15 minutes in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 and subsequently kept for 15 minutes in an imaging chamber at 37°C and 7% CO 2 before imaging for purposes of equilibration. For the cytokine and inhibitor experiments, 25 ng/ml FGF2 (in-house), 1 μM PD03 or 0.01% DMSO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to Blast drops. For ICM aggregates membrane dynamics study, small depressions were indented on a 60-mm dish (Thermo Fisher Scientific) lid by a sterilised aggregation needle (BLS Ltd) and covered with Blast drops (one depression per one drop) overlaying with mineral oil. Three isolated E3.75 ICMs were disposed to make a triangle in a small depression and kept for one hour in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Aggregated ICMs were transferred in the Blast drops under mineral oil on a PDL-coated glass-bottomed dish. Before transferring ICM cells or aggregated ICMs to Blast drops, the drops under mineral oil were buffered in a humid incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for at least 30 minutes. Live images were acquired using Leica TCS Sp5 Confocal microscopy on the single middle z-slice through the cell every ten seconds for ten minutes with three channels (488 nm excitation for Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ reporter, 567 nm excitation for membrane [mTmG] and bright field). For ICM aggregates membrane dynamics study, live images were taken on the several z-slice through the aggregates every 20 seconds for ten minutes.
The mean intensity of Pdgfra H2B-GFP was measured by Fiji. ICM cell lineages were determined by their GFP signal. The E3.5 cells with GFP positive were classified as pPrE. The E3.5 cells with GFP negative were classified as ICM/pPrE cells. The E3.75 cells with the top 40% of GFP intensity were classified as pPrE, the E3.75 cells with the bottom 40% of GFP intensity were classified as pEPI. The E4.0 cells with GFP positive were classified as PrE. The E4.0 cells with GFP negative were classified as EPI. Mitotic cells judging by H2B-GFP morphologies were removed from the analysis.
Each cell’s live imaging data was cropped and registered with StackReg plugin ( Thévenaz et al., 1998 92. Thévenaz, P. ∙ Ruttimann, U.E. ∙ Unser, M. A pyramid approach to subpixel registration based on intensity IEEE Trans. Image Process. 1998; 7 :27-41 Crossref Scopus (2244) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Fiji. The centroid of the first images was used as the centre of the new coordinates system and linear interpolation (See Figures 3 B and S3 B). The position of the cell membrane (tdTomato signal of mTmG) was identified and converted from Cartesian coordinates into polar coordinates. The boundary coordinate plots of the radius versus the angular coordinate ( θ ) were detrended to set the average radial value is zero. This normalises for differences in the cell size and controls for small fluctuations of the focal plane in the z -axis. The variation in time ( V T ) was calculated using Equation 4 , ρ : distance from the centre of a cell. 𝑉 T = ̅ ( 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁡ ( { 𝜌 j ⁡ ( 𝑡 1 ) , 𝜌 j ⁡ ( 𝑡 2 ) , … , 𝜌 j ⁡ ( 𝑡 N ) } ) ) j = 1 : M (Equation 4)
Surface fluctuations on outside cells were scored from 1 to 5, with 1 being no observable fluctuations and 5 being significant observable fluctuations, using only mTmG time-lapse images so as not to identify each cell lineages. A high score indicates that the cell has a dynamic cell membrane movement. This analysis was done single-blind by AY and KC.
For CA-EZR-IRES-mCherry ES cells were plated for 24 hours in N2B27+2i+LIF at 2 × 10 4 cells/cm 2 , and the media were changed to N2B27+2i+LIF with or without 1 μg Dox. Then, cells were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using Accutase and suspended in 100 μl each culture media with 0.01% CellMask TM Green Plasma membrane Stain. The media were buffered in the incubation chamber for at least 30 minutes before suspension. The analysis was performed in the same manner as ICM cell surface fluctuation described above.
For calculation of shape index in the ICM, the analyst was blinded to the fluorescent channel identifying cell type. The perimeter and area of each cell was found using Fiji. The shape index was calculated as the perimeter divided by the square root of the area of the cell. All shape analyses were performed using z-stacks and the slice with the maximum area of the cell was used for the analysis. Coefficient of variation was calculated as the standard deviation of the shape index divided by the mean of the shape index of 15 frames over time (30 seconds between frames).
Recently, cell shape index in a vertex model has emerged as a faithful indicator of its fluidity ( Bi et al., 2015 8. Bi, D. ∙ Lopez, J.H. ∙ Schwarz, J.M. ... A density-independent rigidity transition in biological tissues Nat. Phys. 2015; 11 :1074-1079 Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar , 2016 9. Bi, D. ∙ Yang, X. ∙ Marchetti, M.C. ...

A geometrically controlled rigidity transition in a model for confluent 3D tissues New J. Phys. 2018; 20 :022002 Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar ; Staple et al., 2010 84. Staple, D.B. ∙ Farhadifar, R. ∙ Röper, J.C. ... Mechanics and remodelling of cell packings in epithelia Eur. Phys. J. E Soft Matter. 2010; 33 :117-127 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). In recent work by some of us, cells with difference shapes (and thereby fluidity) as high as in our experiments could produce robust small-scale patterning and demixing ( Sahu et al., 2020 75. Sahu, P. ∙ Sussman, D.M. ∙ Rübsam, M. ... Small-scale demixing in confluent biological tissues Soft Matter. 2020; 16 :3325-3337 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The origin of the small-scale demixing was attributed to differential neighbour exchange barriers at the heterotypic interface. Even though such barriers were not yet quantified systematically in the bulk of 3D tissues, the response to local perturbations along high-tension interfaces was found to be very similar for both dimensions ( Sahu et al., 2021 74. Sahu, P. ∙ Schwarz, J.M. ∙ Manning, M.L. Geometric signatures of tissue surface tension in a three-dimensional model of confluent tissue New J. Phys. 2021; 23 :093043 Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar ; Sussman et al., 2018 88. Sussman, D.M. ∙ Schwarz, J.M. ∙ Marchetti, M.C. ... Soft yet Sharp interfaces in a vertex model of confluent tissue Phys. Rev. Lett. 2018; 120 :058001 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, we studied the interface formation in a mixture composed of two different cell shapes and with no explicit tension, to probe if a similar small-scale demixing as reported in Sahu et al. (2020) 75. Sahu, P. ∙ Sussman, D.M. ∙ Rübsam, M. ... Small-scale demixing in confluent biological tissues Soft Matter. 2020; 16 :3325-3337 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar existed in 3D.
Here, we used the same formula of demixing parameter, in which a value of zero and unity correspond to the minimum and maximum segregation in the tissue. We simulated a mixture composed of 216 polyhedral cells with equally sized sub-components using a 3D self-propelled Voronoi model with periodic boundary conditions. The preferred cell shape index 𝑠 0 was a non-dimensionalised version of the preferred surface area 𝑆 0 and preferred volume 𝑆 0 = 𝑆 0 / 𝑉 2 / 3 0 𝑉 0 i.e. A tissue could transition from being solid-like to fluid-like by increasing the preferred shape index to a value higher than ∼5.41 in 3D ( Merkel and Manning, 2018 56. Merkel, M. ∙ Manning, M.L. A geometrically controlled rigidity transition in a model for confluent 3D tissues New J. Phys. 2018; 20 :022002 Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar ). Considering the average tissue fluidity to be a free parameter, we studied for increasingly fluid-like average shape values of 5.60, 5.75 and 5.90. We fixed the shape disparity to the experimentally obtained value. As shape quantification was easier for 2D cross-sectional images, we used the 2D values to infer the 3D estimate of shape difference as ∼0.8 using the work by Sharp et al. (2019) 82. Sharp, T.A. ∙ Merkel, M. ∙ Manning, M.L. ... Inferring statistical properties of 3D cell geometry from 2D slices PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0209892 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar . For such high differences in shape values, the volume incompressibility ( 𝐾 𝑉 ) needs to be high in order to prevent the size disparity from affecting the patterning. Therefore, we set the 𝐾 𝑉 to 10 while 𝑉 0 = 1 . From the 2D work, one should expect an increase in incompressibility to have a negligible effect on the cellular dynamics.
The natural timescale for our systems was given by ̃ 𝑡 = 1 / ( 𝐾 𝑉 . 𝑉 4 / 3 0 ) which was less than unity for our choice of parameters. Therefore the integration time stepsize was chosen as 𝛥 ⁢ 𝑡 = 0 . 0 1 ⁢ ̃ 𝑡 . For evolving the cellular positions, we used the self-propulsion dynamics where in, the magnitude of self-propulsion speed ( 𝑣 0 ) is set to 0.1 and rotational diffusion coefficient ( 𝐷 𝑟 ) to 1.0. For such high values of rotational diffusivity the transition to brownian regime happened rather quickly i.e 𝑡 / ̃ 𝑡 > 1 / 𝐷 𝑟 . The typical self-diffusivity timescale in our model for a fluid-like shape index of 5.5 was found to be 1 × 1 0 4 ⁢ ̃ 𝑡 . We run for a total of 6 × 1 0 4 ⁢ ̃ 𝑡 that is long enough for an average fluid-like cell to explore the box sidelength of 6 cells.
The initial and final snapshots of a randomly mixed initialization are shown in Figure 7 C. While the mixed initial frame has negligible de-mixing, the final snapshots do have a small-scale patterning. We then quantified the demixing for mixtures with increasing average fluidity, averaged over 250 different initializations each and observe the existence of a small but robust value of segregation that seems to have systemic increase with tissue fluidity. This confirmed that as in the 2D set up, 3D mixtures can also undergo small-scale demixing due to differences in their cell shapes.
To probe for a relationship between the shape index and surface tension fluctuations, we used an energy-minimized configuration of a solid and fluid mixture from Sahu et al. (2020) 75. Sahu, P. ∙ Sussman, D.M. ∙ Rübsam, M. ... Small-scale demixing in confluent biological tissues Soft Matter. 2020; 16 :3325-3337 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar that was produced by using the open source CellGPU code ( Sussman, 2017 87. Sussman, D.M. cellGPU: massively parallel simulations of dynamic vertex models Comput. Phys. Commun. 2017; 219 :400-406 Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar ). Looking closely at the fluid subtype, we found that it has a significant number of edges with negative tension (highlighted in blue) as opposed to the solid subtype where such edges were negligible in number ( Figure 7 D). This might be the crucial link between the more fluid-like subtype having more extensile edges and hence in a non-confluent environment manifests as a greater number of blebs.
For CA-EZR overexpressing experiments, cells were plated for 24 hours in 2i+LIF at 2 × 10 4 cells/cm 2 , and the media were changed to 2i+LIF in the presence of 1 μg Dox. For the imaging of pERM in single CA-EZR cells, cells were cultured in 2i+LIF in the presence of 1 μg Dox for 24 hours prior to being plated onto imaging dishes (μ-Dish 35 mm ibidi dish [81156]). After six hours, the cells were fixed using 4% PFA in CSB for 15 minutes and then permeabilised in with 0.1% Triton in CSB. Blocking was then performed using 2% FBS, 2% BSA in PBS with 0.1% Triton-X for 45 minutes. Cells were then incubated for 90 minutes with the primary antibody in the same buffer as used for blocking. Cells were then washed three times for five minutes with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X. Secondary antibodies were added together with Alexa Fluor™ 647 Phalloidin for one hour in the same buffer as used for blocking and primary antibody incubation. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X three times for five minutes before a final wash in PBS.
ES cells harvested on tissue culture plates were detached using Accutase. The cells were suspended in FBS (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) containing suspension media, and cell concentration was determined. Suspended cells were centrifuged at 1400 rpm for three minutes, pelleted and re-suspended in 2i+LIF in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml Dox. H2B-BFP and CA-EZR-IRES-mCherry ES cell lines were mixed well in a universal tube (Scientific Laboratory Supplies Ltd) at 1:1 ratio and then plated 200 μl per well in round-bottomed low-adhesion 96-well plates (CELLSTAR) with 300 cells per well. After 30 hours culture, aggregated ES cells were collected by mouth pipette, briefly rinsed in PBS, fixed with 4% PFA for 20 minutes at room temperature, rinsed in PBS/PVP, and then incubated briefly in increasing concentrations of Vectashield before mounting on glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in small drops of concentrated Vectashield. Subsequently, coverslips with Vaseline (Unilever) spacer were mounted and sealed with nail varnish. FBS containing suspension media was composed of Glasgow’s minimum essential medium (GMEM) with 10% batch-tested FBS, 1× MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Sigma), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), and 1 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. For calculation of the average radial distance from the centre, R , we assessed the distribution of mCherry levels in the cells. The bottom half of the distribution was assumed to be the control cells and was discarded. In the top 50% expressing cells, the distributions were split into a bottom 1/3, a middle 1/3, and a top 1/3. These were considered, respectively, as the low-, mid-, and high-expressing cells. These were then binarized and used in the formula shown in Figure 4 F to find R .
Rex1-GFPd2/Gap43-mCherry ES cells and R26-Confetti ES cells were used to form aggregates containing siERM ES cells or siACTN4 ES cells and negative control siRNA (NC) cells. siRNA was transfected 12-16 hours before aggregate formation. Aggregation was performed as above with a total seeding density of 40 cells or 80 cells in a 1:1 (siERM/siACTN4: siNC) ratio in N2B27+2i+LIF. For live imaging, aggregates were collected by mouth pipette after 7-8 hours and seeded on N2B27+2i+LIF on PDL-coated dishes.
1 x 10 4 cells tdTomato ES cells were seeded on 0.1% gelatine coated 24-well plates. Cells were transfected with 15 μM of either the targeting (5 μM each SMARTpool siGENOME Mouse Ezrin [M-046568-01-0005], Radixin [M-047230-01-0005], Moesin [M-044428-01-0005]; Dharmacon), actinin alpha4 (M-049970-00-0005, Dharmacon) or control siRNA (D-001210-02-05, Dharmacon) with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for overnight. The media were changed the next day. The transfected cells were utilised for cell shape imaging or chimaera assay. Knockdown efficiency was checked using RT-qPCR.
Total RNA was prepared with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and reverse transcribed using SuperScriptII (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan Fast Universal Master Mix and TaqMan Gene Expression assays (Applied Biosystems). Gapdh was used as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems). For siRNA experiments, the data were further normalised to control cell line. The TaqMan Gene Expression assays IDs were Mm00447761_m1; Ezrin , Mm00447889_m1; Moesin , Mm01177363_m1; Radixin , Mm00502489_m1 ; α-actinin4 .
ES cells (three-five cells per embryo) were injected into 8 cell morulae (E2.5) or early blastocysts (E3.5) via a laser-generated perforation in the zona pellucida using XYClone (Hamilton Thorne Biosciences). Injected embryos were cultured in Blast or N2B27 for 1.5 or 0.5 days, the reach the equivalent of E4.0 blastocysts at 37°C and 5% CO 2 .
E3.75 Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ positive embryos obtained from intercrossing of Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ and CD-1 were used. Isolated single ICM cells were transferred in the M2 drops on a PDL-coated μ-Dish 35 mm ibidi dish. The dishes were exposed to plasma surface treatment (Pico, diener). 50 μg/ml PDL drop was put at the centre of the dish. The coated dishes were incubated for 30 minutes ∼ one hour at room temperature. The PDL drop was washed with M2 medium for three times. The cells were kept for 15 minutes in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . M2 medium concanavalin-A coated (50 μg/ml) carboxyl latex beads (1.9 μm diameter, Thermo Fisher Scientific [C37278]) were added to the drop prior to measurement.
A tether pulling assay was then performed using a homemade built optical tweezer (4W1064nm Laser Quantum Ventus) on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) equipped with a motorised stage (PRIOR Proscan). During the measurements, the position of the bead was recorded at a 90 milliseconds interval rate in the bright field using a 100x oil immersion objective (CFI Plan Fluor DLL, Nikon). pEPI and pPrE cells were identified by their GFP signals. The trap force was later calculated based on a product of the bead displacement (estimated using a custom-made ImageJ plugin) and of the trap stiffness (which was extracted using the method described in Lieber et al., 2013 47. Lieber, A.D. ∙ Yehudai-Resheff, S. ∙ Barnhart, E.L. ... Membrane tension in rapidly moving cells is determined by cytoskeletal forces Curr. Biol. 2013; 23 :1409-1417 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the measurement of the variance of the trap force overtime, ∼10 6 ES cells were plated 16 hours prior to the measurement onto μ-Dish 35 mm ibidi dishes in N2B27. Membrane tension was then measured following the method described above. Of note, here membrane tension was continuously measured on the same cell using a single tether for approximatively five minutes. The number of blebs was then manually counted during the analysis, only blebs forming or retracting during the measurements were taken into account. Data in which the formation of blebs was physically interfering with the tether were excluded from the analysis.
E3.75 Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ positive embryos obtained from intercrossing of Pdgfra H2B-GFP/+ and CD-1 were used. Isolated pPrE and pEPI cells were cultured in a PDL-coated small drop of N2B27 with or without 25 ng/ml FGF2 on 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek; P35G-0.170-14-C) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for 45 minutes. The samples were fixed and stained in the same manner as pERM staining described in the STAR Methods . Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween). For the secondary antibody incubation, cells were first incubated with AlexaFluor donkey anti-goat 488 (Thermo Fisher, 1:1000) followed by incubation with Hoechst 33342 and AlexaFluor647 Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher, 1:200) diluted in PBST for another hour. Cells were then gently washed three times with PBST. The imaging dishes were then filled with STORM buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 10% glucose (w/v), 27 mM MEA, 40 μg/mL catalase, 5 U/mL pyranose oxidase and 2 mM cyclooctatetraene) and imaged immediately.
dSTORM imaging was performed on a commercial Zeiss Elyra 7 microscope. F-actin was imaged in the cellular mid-plane through a 63 x 1.46 NA alpha Plan-Apochromat oil-immersion objective lens and a 1x tube lens under 642 nm (100% laser power) and 405 nm (0-2% laser power) excitation. For each super-resolution image of F-actin, a Hoechst 33342 (405 nm excitation) and GFP (488 nm excitation) snapshot was also acquired. Fluorescence was captured on a sCMOS camera using 20 milliseconds integration time. A total of 15000 frames were typically acquired for super resolution image reconstruction. Reconstructions were generated using the in-built ZEN Black software (Zeiss). Briefly, single molecule localisation was estimated using a multiple object 2D Gaussian fitting routine, accounting for overlapping fluorophores. Data was post-processed to correct for mechanical drift during the acquisition by applying a model-based cross-correlation method and localisations with uncertainties >50 nm were then removed from the data-sets. Cortex thickness measurements were performed on the super-resolution images using a custom-written MATLAB script (described in Serres et al., 2020 81. Serres, M.P. ∙ Samwer, M. ∙ Quang, T.B.A. ... F-actin interactome reveals vimentin as a key regulator of actin organization and cell mechanics in mitosis Dev. Cell. 2020; 52 :210-222.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the cell cortex for each super-resolution data set was manually estimated using a custom MATLAB GUI. The cell cortex was then automatically detected by calculating the maximum intensity peak of the transverse intensity profile along the cell periphery at each pixel along with the user-supplied cortex co-ordinates. The cortex was then straightened using cubic spline fitting, and line scans of the intensity profiles across well-defined cortical regions were performed, from which full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values were used to estimate cortical thickness.
For all statistical analysis in the paper, unless otherwise indicated in corresponding figure legends, n-way ANOVA was used to calculate P-values to establish significant changes between any two means. Details of each ANOVA stated in figure legends: for example, variables used for the n-way ANOVA could be ‘replicate number’, ‘cell type’ (e.g. EPI and PrE) and when relevant ‘small molecule treatment’. There was frequently a significant interaction effect for ‘experiment number’ in the embryo experiments because of experimental variability due to uncertainty in mating times intrinsic to embryo work, so the p-value reporting the significance of this effect is not reported throughout the paper. When there was no significant interaction effect for experimental variability and no ‘treatment’, the p-value reflects a one-way ANOVA. The p-value reported is for ‘cell type’ or ‘small molecule treatment’ depending on the experiment, as indicated in the figure caption. The midline is mean of overall experiments, and error bars represent standard deviation over all experiments.
