Title: Long-Term Programming of CD8 T Cell Immunity by Perinatal Exposure to Glucocorticoids


Abstract: Summary

Early life environmental exposure, particularly during perinatal period, can have a life-long impact on organismal development and physiology. The biological rationale for this phenomenon is to promote physiological adaptations to the anticipated environment based on early life experience. However, perinatal exposure to adverse environments can also be associated with adult-onset disorders. Multiple environmental stressors induce glucocorticoids, which prompted us to investigate their role in developmental programming. Here, we report that perinatal glucocorticoid exposure had long-term consequences and resulted in diminished CD8 T cell response in adulthood and impaired control of tumor growth and bacterial infection. We found that perinatal glucocorticoid exposure resulted in persistent alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Consequently, the level of the hormone in adults was significantly reduced, resulting in decreased CD8 T cell function. Our study thus demonstrates that perinatal stress can have long-term consequences on CD8 T cell immunity by altering HPA axis activity.

Section: Introduction

Early-life exposure to specific environments can influence the development and function of multiple tissues and organ systems, including the central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and immune systems ( Gollwitzer and Marsland, 2015; Mueller et al., 2015; Ralevski and Horvath, 2015 20.

Moreover, early-life experience has been recognized as an important factor for adult-onset diseases. Epidemiological studies showed the association between early-life adversity and later-life development of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, infectious disease, asthma, and cancer in humans ( Barker, 2002; Gluckman and Hanson, 2004; Kelly-Irving et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2006 4.

Soc. 2006; 65 :311-318 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is thought that early-life experiences can affect life-long developmental programing to better adapt to anticipated environments, and disease may develop when the actual environment is mismatched with the anticipated one ( Bateson et al., 2004 5. Bateson, P. ∙ Barker, D. ∙ Clutton-Brock, T. ... Developmental plasticity and human health Nature. 2004; 430 :419-421 Crossref Scopus (1338) PubMed Google Scholar ). This type of long-term adaptive developmental programming, known as phenotypic plasticity, is documented in many invertebrate species and plants ( Bateson et al., 2004 5. Bateson, P. ∙ Barker, D. ∙ Clutton-Brock, T. ... Developmental plasticity and human health Nature. 2004; 430 :419-421 Crossref Scopus (1338) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mechanisms of developmental programming are largely unknown, particularly in mammals, where few examples of phenotypic plasticity are known.
Development of the immune system throughout perinatal period can be affected by several environmental factors, including microbial exposure and diet. A well-known example of this is the increased susceptibility to atopic diseases associated with reduced microbial exposure in early life, as originally suggested in the framework of the “hygiene hypothesis” ( Bach, 2002 2. Bach, J.F. The effect of infections on susceptibility to autoimmune and allergic diseases N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347 :911-920 Crossref Scopus (2169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Studies have revealed that perinatal psychological or nutritional stress, as well as perturbation of microbiota, has strong association with immunological disorders later in life ( Gollwitzer and Marsland, 2015 20. Gollwitzer, E.S. ∙ Marsland, B.J. Impact of Early-Life Exposures on Immune Maturation and Susceptibility to Disease Trends Immunol. 2015; 36 :684-696 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particularly, exposure to early-life stress has been linked with susceptibility to infectious diseases both in humans and rodents ( Beijers et al., 2010; Henriksen and Thuen, 2015; Kay et al., 1998; Nielsen et al., 2011 6.

Childhood adversity increases vulnerability for behavioral symptoms and immune dysregulation in women with breast cancer Brain Behav. Immun. 2013; 30 :S149-S162 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), and reduced adaptive immune response in humans ( O’Connor et al., 2013 44. O’Connor, T.G. ∙ Winter, M.A. ∙ Hunn, J. ... Prenatal maternal anxiety predicts reduced adaptive immunity in infants Brain Behav. Immun. 2013; 32 :21-28 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, how early-life stress is connected to the long-term alteration of immune functions remains unknown.
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the major stress response pathway that controls the production of the stress hormones, glucocorticoids (GCs), in response to various environmental stressors. GCs, acting through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), elicit metabolic and immune-suppressive effects ( Cain and Cidlowski, 2017 10. Cain, D.W. ∙ Cidlowski, J.A. Immune regulation by glucocorticoids Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :233-247 Crossref Scopus (1098) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to its central role in stress response, GCs have been speculated to link early-life adversity and disease development in adulthood ( Barbazanges et al., 1996; Braun et al., 2013 3. Barbazanges, A. ∙ Piazza, P.V. ∙ Le Moal, M. ... Maternal glucocorticoid secretion mediates long-term effects of prenatal stress J. Neurosci. 1996; 16 :3943-3949 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 8.

Rev. 2013; 34 :885-916 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, perinatal GC exposure has been associated with neuropsychiatric diseases and metabolic alterations ( Braun et al., 2013; Kapoor et al., 2008 8. Braun, T. ∙ Challis, J.R. ∙ Newnham, J.P. ...

Fetal programming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and behavior by synthetic glucocorticoids Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 57 :586-595 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). More importantly, HPA axis activity can be affected by perinatal GC treatment, although the duration of this change in HPA in humans is still debatable ( Alexander et al., 2012; Tegethoff et al., 2009 1. Alexander, N. ∙ Rosenlöcher, F. ∙ Stalder, T. ... Impact of antenatal synthetic glucocorticoid exposure on endocrine stress reactivity in term-born children J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 97 :3538-3544 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar 59. Tegethoff, M. ∙ Pryce, C. ∙ Meinlschmidt, G. Effects of intrauterine exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids on fetal, newborn, and infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in humans: a systematic review Endocr. Rev. 2009; 30 :753-789 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Studies with rodents have revealed that early-life adversity as well as GC exposure can lead to HPA axis programming, altering the systemic level of GCs during stress, as a strategy to adapt to a potential future environment ( van Bodegom et al., 2017 61. van Bodegom, M. ∙ Homberg, J.R. ∙ Henckens, M.J.A.G. Modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis by Early Life Stress Exposure Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :87 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, long-term consequences of HPA axis programming, if any, are still poorly understood. It is conceivable that early-life stress exposure may lead to altered immune responses if HPA axis is affected, considering the strong immune-modulating role of GCs.
Here, we report that perinatal GC exposure results in diminished CD8 T cell response in adult animals leading to deficient anti-tumor and antibacterial CD8 T cell responses. We found significantly reduced systemic levels of corticosterone (CORT) with the modification of HPA axis after perinatal GC exposure, leading to decreased GR signaling in CD8 T cells, which was sufficient to cause reduced CD8 T cell response in adults. Our study shows that perinatal stress may have long-term consequences on CD8 T cell immunity by altering HPA axis threshold, thereby increasing predisposition to cancer and infections.

Section: Results

To test the long-term effect of perinatal GC exposure on later-life immune function, we adopted an experimental model of dexamethasone (DEX) treatment in drinking water ( Di Meco et al., 2016 17. Di Meco, A. ∙ Joshi, Y.B. ∙ Lauretti, E. ... Maternal dexamethasone exposure ameliorates cognition and tau pathology in the offspring of triple transgenic AD mice Mol. Psychiatry. 2016; 21 :403-410 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). We treated DEX to the dams from mid-pregnancy to early-postnatal period (embryonic day [E] 7.5 to postnatal day [PND] 1), the period when important hematological and lymphoid organogenesis takes place. After this perinatal treatment, offspring mice were allowed to mature to adulthood (8 to 20 weeks of age), when all the analyses of immune function were conducted ( Figure 1 A). Perinatal DEX exposure increased total lymphocyte counts, CD4 T and CD8 T cells, and CD11b + myeloid cells ( Figures S1 A–S1C). We first tested the response of bone marrow-derived macrophages to lipopolysaccharide or interleukin (IL)-4 and found no significant effect of perinatal DEX exposure ( Figures S1 D and S1E). Next, we asked whether the T cell function in adult mice was altered with perinatal DEX treatment. No significant change in thymic selection was first observed ( Figure S1 F). Using the footpad immunization model ( Figure 1 B), we found antigen-specific interferon (IFN)-γ response was reduced following perinatal DEX exposure in C57BL/6 (B6) mice ( Figures 1 C and 1D). With flow cytometric analysis ( Figure S2 A), we observed that CD8 T cells were the main producers of IFN-γ ( Figure 1 E), and the effector CD8 T cell responses were significantly suppressed while no significant changes were identified in CD4 T cells ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Reduced CD8 T cell responses with perinatal DEX exposure were recapitulated in BALB/c mice ( Figures S2 B and S2C). There was no difference in myeloid cell population in the draining lymph nodes (LNs) ( Figure S2 D). The reduced CD8 T cell response was further confirmed using the T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic OT-I model ( Hogquist et al., 1994 25. Hogquist, K.A. ∙ Jameson, S.C. ∙ Heath, W.R. ... T cell receptor antagonist peptides induce positive selection Cell. 1994; 76 :17-27 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2401) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found reduced OT-I T cell response to ovalbumin (OVA) in mice with the perinatal DEX treatment ( Figure 1 G).
To determine whether these effects were dependent on antigen presenting cells, and to further investigate CD8 T cell function, we utilized ex vivo co-culture system. Naive OT-I CD8 T cells from mice with or without perinatal DEX exposure were sorted and co-cultured with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from control mice ( Figure 1 H). OT-I CD8 T cells were activated with SIINFEKL OVA peptide (OVAp), with or without IL-12, and analyzed by flow cytometry ( Figure S2 E). OT-I CD8 T cells from mice with perinatal DEX exposure showed decreased effector function, characterized by CD25 and IFN-γ expression ( Figure 1 I), as well as CD69, CD44, granzyme B, and T-bet expression ( Figure S2 F). Moreover, OT-I CD8 T cells taken from mice with perinatal DEX treatment showed reduced proliferation upon activation as well as decreased Ki67 expression ( Figures 1 J and S2 F). We also found that the differential responses were maintained up to 5 days after activation ( Figure S2 G). To determine whether the ex vivo changes with perinatal DEX exposure were specific to CD8 T cells, we repeated the experiment utilizing OT-II mice. Unlike in vivo immunization results, OT-II CD4 T cells from perinatally DEX-exposed mice showed a similar decrease in IFN-γ production upon ex vivo activation in Th1 promoting condition ( Figure S2 H).
A link between early-life stress and later-life risk of cancer and infectious disease has been previously reported ( Beijers et al., 2010; Henriksen and Thuen, 2015; Kelly-Irving et al., 2013; Nielsen et al., 2011; Spracklen et al., 2014 6.

Spracklen, C.N. ∙ Wallace, R.B. ∙ Sealy-Jefferson, S. ... Birth weight and subsequent risk of cancer Cancer Epidemiol. 2014; 38 :538-543 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because CD8 T cells play a critical role in controlling various tumors and pathogens, we asked whether altered CD8 T cell function due to perinatal GC exposure would lead to compromised anti-tumor immunity. We first utilized the immunogenic B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. Both B6 and BALB/c mice with perinatal DEX treatment showed accelerated tumor growth, which was more pronounced in allogenic condition ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Consistent with the earlier footpad immunization results, CD45 + cells and CD8 T cell population were significantly reduced inside the tumors as well as in tumor-draining LNs in perinatal DEX-treated mice, while no major difference in natural killer (NK) cell population was found ( Figures S3 A–S3D). At the early stage of tumor development when total tumor cell number was similar, we found that CD8 T cells were specifically affected among NK, CD4, and CD8 T cells and showed reduced IL-2 and granzyme B expression ( Figure 2 C). To further corroborate this finding, we adopted an immunogenic “Yale University mouse melanoma exposed to radiation 1.7” (YUMMER1.7) tumor model that was developed to carry three driver mutations ( Braf V600E, Pten −/− , and Cdkn2a −/− ) as well as neoantigens due to UV irradiation ( Wang et al., 2017 63. Wang, J. ∙ Perry, C.J. ∙ Meeth, K. ... UV-induced somatic mutations elicit a functional T cell response in the YUMMER1.7 mouse melanoma model Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2017; 30 :428-435 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to control mice, perinatally DEX-exposed mice showed higher YUMMER1.7 tumor burden ( Figure 2 D). To directly test the role of CD8 T cells in anti-tumor responses, we utilized OT-I mice and E.G7-OVA lymphoma that expresses OVA antigen. We first confirmed that there was no E.G7-OVA tumor growth in control OT-I mice, compared to B6 mice ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, OT-I mice with perinatal DEX exposure failed to control E.G7-OVA tumor growth ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Next, we sorted the OT-I CD8 T cells from mice with or without perinatal DEX exposure, and adoptively transferred them to wild-type mice implanted with E.G7-OVA. While mice that received OT-I cells from control animals effectively suppressed E.G7-OVA tumor growth, mice that received OT-I cells from perinatally DEX-exposed mice failed to control tumor growth ( Figure 2 G). These results showed that perinatal GC exposure made mice susceptible to tumor development due to cell-intrinsic defect in CD8 T cell function.
We next assessed the effect of perinatal GC exposure on CD8 T cells in a mouse infection model. We utilized Listeria monocytogenes expressing defined OVA antigen (LM-OVA) to analyze antigen-specific CD8 T cell response. We found that antigen-specific CD8 T cell response was significantly reduced, and Listeria burden increased in mice with perinatal DEX exposure ( Figures 3 A and 3B). We tested the antigen-specific killing activity of CD8 T cells in vivo and found that antigen-loaded cells were killed less efficiently in perinatally DEX-exposed mice in the context of LM-OVA infection ( Figures 3 C and S4 A). We also further analyzed the memory precursor effector cells (MPECs) and short-live effector cells (SLECs) among the antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells and found that perinatal DEX treatment did not change those populations ( Figure S4 B). Next, we tested the antibacterial function of CD8 T cells by utilizing the adoptive transfer model ( Figure S4 C). Mice that received OT-I CD8 T cells from perinatally DEX-exposed mice showed lower OT-I cell numbers and higher bacterial burden ( Figures 3 D and 3E). Adoptively transferred OT-I cells showed diminished IFN-γ and granzyme B expression in these mice ( Figure 3 F). These results demonstrate that mice with perinatal GC exposure have compromised CD8 T cell function in vivo in the context of bacterial infection.
Early-life stress models in rodents have been reported to result in either enhanced or decreased CORT level, depending on the type, timing, and duration of stressors ( van Bodegom et al., 2017 61. van Bodegom, M. ∙ Homberg, J.R. ∙ Henckens, M.J.A.G. Modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis by Early Life Stress Exposure Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :87 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore measured CORT in serum and found that perinatal DEX exposure resulted in decreased CORT level at steady state in adult B6 and BALB/c mice ( Figures 4 A, S5 A, and S5B). Moreover, adult mice with the perinatal DEX treatment had a reduced CORT induction under various stress conditions, including tumor implantation, infection, and immobilization ( Figure 4 B), known to induce CORT ( Kim et al., 2001; Valles et al., 2013 31. Kim, D. ∙ Reilly, A. ∙ Lawrence, D.A. Relationships between IFNgamma, IL-6, corticosterone, and Listeria monocytogenes pathogenesis in BALB/c mice Cell.

Stress hormones promote growth of B16-F10 melanoma metastases: an interleukin 6- and glutathione-dependent mechanism J. Transl. Med. 2013; 11 :72 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although glucocorticoids are primarily known for their immunosuppressive effects, previous studies suggested a more complex picture with both positive and negative effects on the immune system ( Wilckens and De Rijk, 1997 66. Wilckens, T. ∙ De Rijk, R. Glucocorticoids and immune function: unknown dimensions and new frontiers Immunol. Today. 1997; 18 :418-424 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies also found that the absence of GR signaling can decrease CD4 and CD8 T cell function ( Mittelstadt et al., 2012; Shimba et al., 2018 39. Mittelstadt, P.R. ∙ Monteiro, J.P. ∙ Ashwell, J.D. Thymocyte responsiveness to endogenous glucocorticoids is required for immunological fitness J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122 :2384-2394 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Shimba, A. ∙ Cui, G. ∙ Tani-Ichi, S. ... Glucocorticoids Drive Diurnal Oscillations in T Cell Distribution and Responses by Inducing Interleukin-7 Receptor and CXCR4 Immunity. 2018; 48 :286-298 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on these findings, we asked whether the reduction in basal CORT level was responsible for the reduced CD8 T cell function in the mice with perinatal DEX treatment. To test this, we first utilized RU486, a GR antagonist. In BMDC and OT-I co-culture system, the addition of RU486 significantly suppressed OT-I activation ex vivo ( Figure 4 C). Next, we used metyrapone (2-methyl-1,2-di-3-pyridyl-1-propanone [MTY]), a drug that blocks the synthesis of CORT. Treatment with MTY during footpad immunization in vivo inhibited the antigen-specific CD8 T cell response ( Figure 4 D). The level of reduction with MTY was comparable to that with perinatal DEX exposure ( Figure 4 D). Similarly, OT-I mice that received MTY also showed suppressed CD8 T cell response with footpad immunization ( Figure 4 E). To confirm these findings, we immunized adrenalectomized (ADX) mice and assessed the antigen-specific CD8 T cell response. Consistent with the results with MTY, ADX mice showed reduced CD8 T cell response ( Figure S5 C). Finally, we used a genetic model ( Cd4 -Cre; Nr3c1 -flox mice) to eliminate GR signaling specifically in T cells ( Figure S5 D). Deletion of GR in T cells significantly reduced antigen-specific CD8 T cell activation after immunization ( Figure 4 F). The decrease in CD8 T cell response due to GR deletion was comparable to the effect of perinatal DEX exposure, suggesting that the effect of perinatal DEX on CD8 T cell function is largely mediated by T cell intrinsic GR function.
Next, we asked whether the change in non-hematopoietic compartment also contributed to the changes in CD8 T cell responses. To test this, we conducted bone marrow transplantation experiments by transferring bone marrow cells from CD45.2 + OT-I mice to CD45.1 + B6 mice after irradiation. When OT-I bone marrow was transplanted to an irradiated wild-type hosts with perinatal DEX treatment ( Figure 4 G), activation of OT-I CD8 T cells was significantly decreased in vivo ( Figure 4 H) and ex vivo (BMDC and OT-I co-culture, Figures S5 E and S5F). Furthermore, when OT-I bone marrow from mice with perinatal DEX exposure was transplanted to irradiated wild-type control hosts, a significant reduction of OT-I CD8 T cell response was also observed, suggesting that hematopoietic stem cell compartment also contributes to the reduced CD8 T cell function with perinatal GC exposure ( Figure S5 G).
T cells devoid of GR signaling are defective in homing to lymphoid tissues and have impaired survival and activation ( Shimba et al., 2018 54. Shimba, A. ∙ Cui, G. ∙ Tani-Ichi, S. ... Glucocorticoids Drive Diurnal Oscillations in T Cell Distribution and Responses by Inducing Interleukin-7 Receptor and CXCR4 Immunity. 2018; 48 :286-298 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this report, GR-deficient CD8 T cells had reduced activation and survival following immunization in vivo with reduced expression of Bcl2 and CD69 ( Figures 4 F, 5 A, and 5B). When GR-deficient naive CD8 T cells were co-cultured with BMDC, activation was diminished upon CD3 stimulation ( Figure 5 C). Expression of CD25, IL-2, T-bet, Bcl2, and Ki67, as well as phosphorylated-STAT5, was all downregulated in GR-deficient CD8 T cells ( Figure 5 D). Moreover, mice with T cell-specific GR deficiency showed reduced anti-tumor response in YUMMER melanoma model ( Figure S6 A). CD8 T cells from ADX mice also showed reduced activation and expression of CD25, Bcl2, and IL-2 in this setting ( Figures S6 B and S6C). All of these GR-dependent changes were also recapitulated in OT-I CD8 T cells taken from the mice with perinatal DEX exposure, characterized by the reduction of CD25, Bcl2, and IL-2 when activated with OVAp on BMDC ( Figures 1 I, S2 F, and S6 D).
To expand on these findings, we sorted CD8 T cells after immunization from control and DEX-treated mice and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that the expression of genes involved in the CD28-mTOR-P70S6K pathways was significantly decreased, whereas the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway was increased with perinatal DEX exposure ( Figures 5 E, S6 E, and S6F). Consistently, the expression of key genes in those pathways ( Figure 5 F) and known GR target genes was significantly decreased ( Figure 5 G). We confirmed that OT-I CD8 T cells with perinatal DEX exposure showed increased OXPHOS function during activation ( Figures S6 G and S6H). To validate these changes, we conducted phospho-flow staining of OT-I CD8 T cells in the context of BMDC co-culture and OVAp activation. We found the phosphorylation of ZAP70 (Y319), mTOR (S2448), Akt (S473), and S6 (S236) was all significantly downregulated with perinatal DEX treatment ( Figure 5 H). Overall changes in these signaling pathways likely account for the decrease in activation and survival of CD8 T cells.
Next, we asked how perinatal DEX exposure resulted in a long-term programming in naive CD8 T cells. We performed RNA-seq analysis of naive OT-I CD8 T cells with or without perinatal DEX exposure. Among the genes that were differentially regulated, the expression of Tbx21 , Eomes , and Cxcr3 was significantly decreased in naive OT-I CD8 cells with perinatal DEX treatment ( Figure 6 A). We then performed an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to evaluate the genome-wide chromatin state of those OT-I CD8 T cells. With motif enrichment analysis from ATAC-seq peaks, we found T-bet binding sites were significantly depleted in the perinatal DEX-exposed group ( Figure 6 B). Consistent with this finding, chromatin accessibility of Ifng locus with T-bet binding site, which is known to be important for IFN-γ expression ( Karmaus et al., 2019 27. Karmaus, P.W.F. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Lim, S.A. ... Metabolic heterogeneity underlies reciprocal fates of T H 17 cell stemness and plasticity Nature. 2019; 565 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ), was reduced in naive OT-I T cells with perinatal DEX treatment ( Figure 6 C). Moreover, chromatin accessibility of Tbx21 locus itself was also decreased ( Figure 6 D). We identified consensus GR binding sites in the affected sites of Tbx21 locus ( Figure 6 D), suggesting that reduced GR signaling following perinatal DEX exposure led to low chromatin accessibility of Tbx21 locus. These findings suggest that perinatal DEX exposure results in long-term epigenetic reprogramming of naive CD8 T cells, leading to reduced effector function.
Our findings so far indicate that perinatal DEX exposure resulted in persistently decreased CD8 T cell function via reducing systemic level of CORT. Given that early-life stress and GC exposure can lead to HPA axis programming ( van Bodegom et al., 2017 61. van Bodegom, M. ∙ Homberg, J.R. ∙ Henckens, M.J.A.G. Modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis by Early Life Stress Exposure Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :87 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next asked how perinatal DEX exposure altered systemic CORT level in the adults in our model. We first analyzed the gene expression of corticosterone synthesis enzymes in adrenal glands of mice with or without perinatal DEX treatment, but found no obvious differences ( Figure S7 A). Next, we assessed the brain regions that are important for HPA axis regulation. CORT binds to two receptors in the brain: the type I corticosteroid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the type II corticosteroid receptor, GR. Expression of these receptors in hippocampus and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVH) is particularly important for HPA axis regulation ( De Kloet et al., 1998 16. De Kloet, E.R. ∙ Vreugdenhil, E. ∙ Oitzl, M.S. ... Brain corticosteroid receptor balance in health and disease Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19 :269-301 Crossref Scopus (2299) PubMed Google Scholar ). MR has higher affinity to CORT than GR and has been implicated as an important regulator of HPA axis in the lower range of circadian CORT regulation for proactive negative feedback ( De Kloet et al., 1998 16. De Kloet, E.R. ∙ Vreugdenhil, E. ∙ Oitzl, M.S. ... Brain corticosteroid receptor balance in health and disease Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19 :269-301 Crossref Scopus (2299) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particularly, GR- and MR-expressing neurons in dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA) 3, and CA1 innervate neurons in subiculum, which sends a negative signal for the CRH production in the neurons of PVH ( Han et al., 2005; Schoenfeld and Gould, 2012; Yoshiya et al., 2013 21. Han, F. ∙ Ozawa, H. ∙ Matsuda, K. ... Colocalization of mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus and hypothalamus Neurosci. Res. 2005; 51 :371-381 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Schoenfeld, T.J. ∙ Gould, E. Stress, stress hormones, and adult neurogenesis Exp. Neurol. 2012; 233 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Yoshiya, M. ∙ Komatsuzaki, Y. ∙ Hojo, Y. ... Corticosterone rapidly increases thorns of CA3 neurons via synaptic/extranuclear glucocorticoid receptor in rat hippocampus Front. Neural Circuits. 2013; 7 :191 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found significantly more MR expression in dentate gyrus and CA1, CA3 region of hippocampus as well as in PVH of GR-expressing neurons in perinatal DEX-treated mice ( Figures 7 A–7C). We observed that animals exposed to DEX presented increased non-nuclear MR as well ( Figure S7 B), which is known to influence glutamatergic signaling ( Karst et al., 2005 28. Karst, H. ∙ Berger, S. ∙ Turiault, M. ... Mineralocorticoid receptors are indispensable for nongenomic modulation of hippocampal glutamate transmission by corticosterone Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :19204-19207 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the hippocampal MR provides a negative feedback to the HPA axis ( De Kloet et al., 1998 16. De Kloet, E.R. ∙ Vreugdenhil, E. ∙ Oitzl, M.S. ... Brain corticosteroid receptor balance in health and disease Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19 :269-301 Crossref Scopus (2299) PubMed Google Scholar ), increased MR expression should result in reduced HPA steady-state activity and CORT level. Consistently, we found serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) level was decreased at steady-state ( Figure S7 C). Together, these data indicate that perinatal DEX exposure changed the set point of the HPA axis by raising the threshold for negative feedback signal.
Because various early-life stressors can affect the HPA axis, we asked whether different perinatal stressors can cause alteration in systemic CORT level. We found prenatal cold exposure (E14.5–PND0) led to the enhancement of basal CORT, while the longer duration of the same cold stress spanning perinatal periods (E13.5–PND7) can elicit the suppression of CORT level ( Figure 7 D). Moreover, a single injection of poly (I:C) on PND3 strongly inhibited CORT level in later life ( Figure 7 D). This result supports the idea that HPA axis can be programmed to be hyperactive or hypoactive depending on the type, duration, timing, and frequency of stressors ( van Bodegom et al., 2017 61. van Bodegom, M. ∙ Homberg, J.R. ∙ Henckens, M.J.A.G. Modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis by Early Life Stress Exposure Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :87 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, we tested the CORT level with different regimes of DEX treatment. We found DEX treatment during mid-pregnancy (E7.5–E14.5) did not change adult CORT level, while DEX treatment during late-pregnancy (E14.5–PND1) and maternal DEX treatment during postnatal 2 weeks (PND0–PND14) decreased the basal level of CORT ( Figure 7 E). Nevertheless, the mice with postnatal DEX exposure showed enhanced CORT level with restraint stress, suggesting the responsiveness to stress is differentially programmed with perinatal and postnatal DEX exposure ( Figures 4 B and S7 D). Based on this, we speculated that the sensitive developmental window for CORT programming would be around the time of birth. To test this idea, we directly injected DEX to pups on PND2, and found PND2 DEX injection was sufficient to reduce basal CORT level in the adults ( Figure 7 F). We also found that the single injection of DEX on PND2 was sufficient to decrease CD8 T cell function in vivo and ex vivo ( Figure 7 G). To test a possible influence of microbiota, we repeated the experiments in littermates that were born and housed together and found the consistent reduction of CD8 T cell function with PND2 DEX treatment (Figure S7E), suggesting the phenotype in this setting is microbiota-independent. Moreover, we found the increased expression of hippocampal MR with PND2 DEX exposure ( Figure S7 F). Of note, unlike perinatal DEX treatment, dentate gyrus nuclear MR was not affected by PND2 DEX, suggesting a differential mechanism of programming by distinctive hippocampal neuronal population. Finally, we further explored the developmental window with other DEX treatment regimens and confirmed the importance of periods around birth for the functional reduction of CD8 T cell ( Figure 7 H). The only exception to this trend was in mice exposed to DEX during the first 2 weeks of pregnancy (E1.5–E14.5), which also showed reduced CD8 T cell function ( Figure 7 H). Overall, these results suggest that various perinatal stressors can program HPA axis, and GC has a direct role in this programming.

Section: Discussion

Our study shows that perinatal stress hormone exposure has long-term consequences for CD8 T cell immunity due to alteration of the HPA axis activity. Specifically, we found that perinatal GC treatment resulted in impaired antigen-specific CD8 T cell response to bacterial infection and implanted tumors in adult mice. Perinatal GC exposure led to increased hippocampal MR expression thereby lowering the threshold for GC negative feedback and changing the HPA set point resulting in lower CORT level in circulation. We also found that suppression of GR signaling or depletion of CORT production by adrenalectomy was sufficient to decrease CD8 T cell activation and survival. Overall these results indicate developmental programming of immunity can occur due to early-life stress via the modification of HPA axis ( Figure 7 I).
Our study adds to the evidence that early life stress experience can program HPA axis activity to either the higher or lower level, depending on the type, duration, and timing of stressors ( van Bodegom et al., 2017 61. van Bodegom, M. ∙ Homberg, J.R. ∙ Henckens, M.J.A.G. Modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis by Early Life Stress Exposure Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :87 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is presumed that mild to moderate stress may lead to hyperactive HPA axis, whereas extreme stress may produce hypoactive HPA axis ( van Bodegom et al., 2017 61. van Bodegom, M. ∙ Homberg, J.R. ∙ Henckens, M.J.A.G. Modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis by Early Life Stress Exposure Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :87 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). The precise rules and mechanism behind these phenomena are yet to be fully understood. However, the alterations of HPA axis activity do not appear to be random, but rather may be designed to adapt to different environments after birth, as suggested before ( Braun et al., 2013; Schmidt, 2011 8. Braun, T. ∙ Challis, J.R. ∙ Newnham, J.P. ... Early-life glucocorticoid exposure: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, placental function, and long-term disease risk Endocr.

Animal models for depression and the mismatch hypothesis of disease Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2011; 36 :330-338 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the alteration of GC with early-life stress has been reported not only in mammals but also in birds and fish ( Henriksen et al., 2011; Reyes-Contreras et al., 2019 24. Henriksen, R. ∙ Rettenbacher, S. ∙ Groothuis, T.G. Prenatal stress in birds: pathways, effects, function and perspectives Neurosci. Biobehav.

Early-life manipulation of cortisol and its receptor alters stress axis programming and social competence Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2019; 374 :20180119 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting HPA axis programming may be an evolutionarily conserved adaptation strategy.
In our study, we found that long-term immunity is affected by perinatal stress. The association between early-life stress and decreased immune function in later-life has been recognized previously ( Beijers et al., 2010; Henriksen and Thuen, 2015; Kay et al., 1998; Nielsen et al., 2011 6.

Our study indicates that HPA axis programming could be one of the mechanisms that mediates the long-term immune alteration with early-life stress. Considering the role of hypothalamus as the central integrator of various environmental signals for optimal distribution of resources for survival and reproduction success ( Wang et al., 2019 64. Wang, A. ∙ Luan, H.H. ∙ Medzhitov, R. An evolutionary perspective on immunometabolism Science. 2019; 363 :eaar3932 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ), having compromised immunity could be the consequence of allocating resources to the appropriate maintenance program for successful adaptation, as suggested by the life history theory ( Okin and Medzhitov, 2012; Stearns, 1992 45. Okin, D. ∙ Medzhitov, R. Evolution of inflammatory diseases Curr. Biol. 2012; 22 :R733-R740 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Stearns, S.C. The Evolution of Life Histories Oxford University Press, 1992 Google Scholar ).
We also found GC plays an immune-enhancing role on CD8 T cells. This finding is consistent with recent report that showed that circadian rise of GC increases T cell survival, migration, and activation ( Shimba et al., 2018 54. Shimba, A. ∙ Cui, G. ∙ Tani-Ichi, S. ... Glucocorticoids Drive Diurnal Oscillations in T Cell Distribution and Responses by Inducing Interleukin-7 Receptor and CXCR4 Immunity. 2018; 48 :286-298 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the findings by Shimba et al. (2018) 54. Shimba, A. ∙ Cui, G. ∙ Tani-Ichi, S. ... Glucocorticoids Drive Diurnal Oscillations in T Cell Distribution and Responses by Inducing Interleukin-7 Receptor and CXCR4 Immunity. 2018; 48 :286-298 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar , we found that survival of CD8 T cell and expression of Bcl2 were decreased, and the expression of CD25 and IL-2, as well as phosphorylation of Stat5, were all downregulated in CD8 T cell without GR signaling. IL-2 signaling regulates multiple phosphorylation events for T cell activation and survival ( Ross et al., 2016 50. Ross, S.H. ∙ Rollings, C. ∙ Anderson, K.E. ... Phosphoproteomic Analyses of Interleukin 2 Signaling Reveal Integrated JAK Kinase-Dependent and -Independent Networks in CD8(+) T Cells Immunity. 2016; 45 :685-700 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ); therefore, the decline in survival and activation in GR-deficient or perinatally DEX-exposed CD8 T cells should have been affected by the reduction of CD25 and IL-2 signaling. We found that the expression of genes involved in OXPHOS was increased in CD8 T cells with perinatal DEX exposure. Considering the effect of IL-2 on glycolytic metabolism ( Macintyre et al., 2011 36. Macintyre, A.N. ∙ Finlay, D. ∙ Preston, G. ... Protein kinase B controls transcriptional programs that direct cytotoxic T cell fate but is dispensable for T cell metabolism Immunity. 2011; 34 :224-236 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ), it could be the consequence of decreased IL-2 signaling. Alternatively, increased OXPHOS in CD8 T cells could be upstream of decreased IL-2 production, given the report that utilizing of OXPHOS over glycolysis leads to decrease in IFN-γ and IL-2 production during T cell activation ( Chang et al., 2013 13. Chang, C.H. ∙ Curtis, J.D. ∙ Maggi, Jr., L.B. ... Posttranscriptional control of T cell effector function by aerobic glycolysis Cell. 2013; 153 :1239-1251 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, the effect we observed in vivo was mostly restricted to CD8 T cells. However, CD4 T cells from the mice with perinatal GC exposure also had decreased effector function in Th1 promoting condition with ex vivo activation. The reason for the difference between in vivo and ex vivo conditions for Th1 response is unclear.
In our study, naive CD8 T cells showed reduced priming with lower expression of T-bet and reduced chromatin accessibility of the Ifng locus. While the suppression of GR signaling during activation with GR antagonist, RU486, was sufficient to reduce CD8 T cell activation, ATAC-seq results suggest there is another layer of GC regulation of T cells. Because thymic selection can be altered by GR signaling ( Mittelstadt et al., 2012, 2018; Taves et al., 2019 39. Mittelstadt, P.R. ∙ Monteiro, J.P. ∙ Ashwell, J.D. Thymocyte responsiveness to endogenous glucocorticoids is required for immunological fitness J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122 :2384-2394 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Mittelstadt, P.R. ∙ Taves, M.D. ∙ Ashwell, J.D. Cutting Edge: De Novo Glucocorticoid Synthesis by Thymic Epithelial Cells Regulates Antigen-Specific Thymocyte Selection J. Immunol. 2018; 200 :1988-1994 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Taves, M.D. ∙ Mittelstadt, P.R. ∙ Presman, D.M. ... Single-Cell Resolution and Quantitation of Targeted Glucocorticoid Delivery in the Thymus Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :3629-3642 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), T cell repertoire and naive T cell maintenance can potentially be affected by perinatal GC exposure. However, we did not find significant changes in thymocyte population, and we observed the GC effect in a TCR “fixed” OT-I system. Moreover, we even found that stem cell compartment contributed the compromised CD8 T cell response. These results suggest that the phenotypic changes in naive CD8 T cells are potentially set up even before thymic selection. We found that the changes in CD8 T cells are maintained after the adoptive transfer of cells to new environments such as in new hosts or in cell culture media, indicating a stable “imprinting” of the gene expression programs in CD8 T cells by early life GC exposure. Given the loss of accessibility of GR binding sites of the Tbx21 locus following perinatal GC exposure, it is conceivable that systemic reduction of GC accounts for those changes.
We also observed that MR expression is increased in the hippocampus following perinatal DEX exposure. MR has higher affinity to CORT than GR and has been recognized as a main regulator of HPA axis under lower circadian range of CORT oscillation ( De Kloet et al., 1998 16. De Kloet, E.R. ∙ Vreugdenhil, E. ∙ Oitzl, M.S. ... Brain corticosteroid receptor balance in health and disease Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19 :269-301 Crossref Scopus (2299) PubMed Google Scholar ). As CORT level increases with stress, GR occupancy also increases, and both GR and MR work in concert for the negative feedback to bring HPA axis activity to homeostatic level ( Bradbury et al., 1994; De Kloet et al., 1998 7. Bradbury, M.J. ∙ Akana, S.F. ∙ Dallman, M.F. Roles of type I and II corticosteroid receptors in regulation of basal activity in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis during the diurnal trough and the peak: evidence for a nonadditive effect of combined receptor occupation Endocrinology. 1994; 134 :1286-1296 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 16. De Kloet, E.R. ∙ Vreugdenhil, E. ∙ Oitzl, M.S. ... Brain corticosteroid receptor balance in health and disease Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19 :269-301 Crossref Scopus (2299) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, increased expression of MR in hippocampus should lead to reduced CORT induction. Mechanism of long-term maintenance of higher MR expression is of particular interest for future studies. Given the epigenetic modification of GR in hippocampus of pups due to maternal behavior ( Weaver et al., 2004 65. Weaver, I.C. ∙ Cervoni, N. ∙ Champagne, F.A. ... Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7 :847-854 Crossref Scopus (4901) PubMed Google Scholar ), one can envision that MR expression is maintained in a similar manner by epigenetic mechanisms. Consistent with this possibility, changes in DNA methylation of GR and MR gene loci were found in children with the maternal prenatal depressive symptoms ( Stonawski et al., 2019 57. Stonawski, V. ∙ Frey, S. ∙ Golub, Y. ... Associations of prenatal depressive symptoms with DNA methylation of HPA axis-related genes and diurnal cortisol profiles in primary school-aged children Dev. Psychopathol. 2019; 31 :419-431 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further assessment is required to address the precise mechanism for the induction of MR with perinatal GC exposure.
In this study, we found an important role of perinatal GC in the programming of HPA axis. GC induced by physiological stress during pregnancy may potentially be transferred to the pups during prenatal and perinatal period. During prenatal period, fetus is influenced by maternal GC: despite of high expression of placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-2 (HSD11B2) that degrades active CORT, maternal GC can access fetal circulation at the peak of circadian rise and under stress ( Barbazanges et al., 1996; Venihaki et al., 2000 3. Barbazanges, A. ∙ Piazza, P.V. ∙ Le Moal, M. ... Maternal glucocorticoid secretion mediates long-term effects of prenatal stress J. Neurosci. 1996; 16 :3943-3949 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 62.

USA. 2000; 97 :7336-7341 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). The expression HSD11B2 is also decreased under chronic stress, allowing maternal CORT to affect fetal system ( Mairesse et al., 2007 37. Mairesse, J. ∙ Lesage, J. ∙ Breton, C. ... Maternal stress alters endocrine function of the feto-placental unit in rats Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292 :E1526-E1533 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). After birth, mice and rats have a stress hypo-responsive period, and during this period, the pups become insensitive to various environmental stressors for GC induction ( Levine, 1994; Sapolsky and Meaney, 1986 34. Levine, S. The ontogeny of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The influence of maternal factors Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1994; 746 :275-288, discussion 289–293 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Sapolsky, R.M. ∙ Meaney, M.J. Maturation of the adrenocortical stress response: neuroendocrine control mechanisms and the stress hyporesponsive period Brain Res. 1986; 396 :64-76 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, maternal care during this period has a strong influence on HPA axis development and long-term behavioral changes ( Weaver et al., 2004 65. Weaver, I.C. ∙ Cervoni, N. ∙ Champagne, F.A. ... Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7 :847-854 Crossref Scopus (4901) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is uncertain whether maternal GC via breast milk has a direct effect on HPA axis programming. While the treatment of CORT to nursing dams in drinking water has a long-term effect on offspring’s behavior and HPA axis activity ( Catalani et al., 1993, 2011 11. Catalani, A. ∙ Marinelli, M. ∙ Scaccianoce, S. ... Progeny of mothers drinking corticosterone during lactation has lower stress-induced corticosterone secretion and better cognitive performance Brain Res. 1993; 624 :209-215 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar 12.

Rev. 2011; 35 :1502-1517 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), it can also affect maternal behavior. Our study adds evidence for the direct programming by GC, independent of maternal behavior, because we did not observe obvious changes of maternal behavior with perinatal GC treatment and, more importantly, direct injection of DEX to pups was sufficient to program HPA axis.

Male and female C57BL/6J (stock #000664), B6-CD45.1 (stock #002014), Balb/cJ (stock #000651), OT-I (stock #003831), OT-II (stock #004194), Nr3c1 fl/fl (stock #021021), and CD4-Cre (stock #017336) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. For the adrenalectomized (ADX) study, we ordered ADX mice and sham operated C57BL/6J (stock #000664 with operation) mice from Jackson Laboratory. Mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility and all animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional regulations after protocol review and approval by Yale University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
For DEX treatment, 8-16 week old female mice were treated with DEX (1.3 μg/ml; diluted in 0.002% DMSO and balanced with 0.02% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as vehicle (Sigma)) in drinking water after conception with different timing of fetal and neonatal development. Considering water volume uptake (3-5 ml/day) and body weight change during pregnancy (20-30 g), mice received approximately 0.2 mg/kg of DEX per day. The dosage and timing of treatment were adopted and modified based on the study that treated pregnant mice with DEX ( Di Meco et al., 2016 17. Di Meco, A. ∙ Joshi, Y.B. ∙ Lauretti, E. ... Maternal dexamethasone exposure ameliorates cognition and tau pathology in the offspring of triple transgenic AD mice Mol. Psychiatry. 2016; 21 :403-410 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). We chose to treat DEX in drinking water to minimize unnecessary stress that may be caused by handling and injection. For direct injection of DEX to pups, DEX (0.5 mg/kg) was delivered intraperitoneally on different day after birth. All the mice with perinatal DEX exposure remained undisturbed until they become mature (8-20 week old) when the phenotype was assessed.
For footpad immunization assay, mice were immunized both feet subcutaneously in rear footpads with 50 μL of PBS contains 50 μg OVA, with or without 5 μg LPS (Sigma) and 50% incomplete freuds’s adjuvant (IFA). Cells in popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were collected after 5 days post immunization, counted and seeded (0.5-1 million cells per well) in 96 well plate in RPMI1640 media supplemented 10% FBS (GIBCO or BenchMark) with 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO) with 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). For the experiments with ADX mice, only one foot was immunized to prevent morbidity and mortality related to hyper-inflammation, and charcoal-stripped FBS was utilized for ex vivo culture (GIBCO). Cells were re-stimulated with 9 – 90 μg of OVA for 16 hours to 72 hours. Supernatant was collected for cytokine measurement, and cells were analyzed with flow cytometry after 4 hours of Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetat (PMA, 50 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), ionomycin (1 μM, Cell signaling techology), Golgi plug (1x, BD Biosciences) stimulation. Some mice were treated with Metyrapone (Cayman), corticosterone synthesis inhibitor, at 0.8 mg/ml in drinking water from 7 days before footpad immunization until the day of LN collection ( Chen et al., 2010 14. Chen, Y. ∙ Qiao, S. ∙ Tuckermann, J. ... Thymus-derived glucocorticoids mediate androgen effects on thymocyte homeostasis FASEB J. 2010; 24 :5043-5051 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For tumor study, tumor cell lines were cultured, counted and implanted (B16-F10: 10 5 cells/100 μl; YUMMER: 10 5 cells/100 μl; E.G7-OVA: 0.5 × 10 5 - 1 × 10 6 cells/100 μl) subcutaneously in the flank of mice, and tumor growth was measured with digital caliper. Mice with moribund or carrying tumor exceeding 1000 mm 3 in volume were euthanized as the end point of the experiment. For the assessment of tumor positive mice were made when the tumor size exceeded 15 mm 2 . For immune cell analysis, tumor and tumor draining lymph nodes were harvested, and digested with 100 U/ml collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical Co.) at 37°C for 30 minutes, stimulated with PMA, ionomycin and Golgi Plug for 4 hours, and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and analyzed with flow cytometry. For the study for E.G7-OVA killing with adoptively transferred OT-I, mice were first implanted with 1 million E.G7-OVA subcutaneously. On day 5, OT-I CD8 T cells taken from OT-I mice with or without perinatal DEX treatment were sorted with Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and 0.1 million cells were adoptively transferred intra-orbitally. On day 6, OT-I cells were activated with 100 μg poly (I:C) + 100 μg OVA injected intra-orbitally, and tumor size was assessed.
For infection of mice, OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes strain (LM-OVA) was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Leo Lefrancois ( Pope et al., 2001 46. Pope, C. ∙ Kim, S.K. ∙ Marzo, A. ... Organ-specific regulation of the CD8 T cell response to Listeria monocytogenes infection J. Immunol. 2001; 166 :3402-3409 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ). LM-OVA was grown to log phase in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (BD), washed once with PBS, and resuspended in fresh BHI. Mice were injected retro-orbitally with 1 × 10 5 colony forming units (CFU) of LM-OVA diluted in PBS. For adoptive transfer, CD8 T cells isolated from OT-I mice with or without perinatal DEX exposure were sorted with MACS, labeled with Cell Trace Violet (Invitrogen), injected to host mice. For immune cell analysis, cells were isolated from blood or spleen, processed for single cell suspension, stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and analyzed with flow cytometry. Bacterial burden was quantified at the day 3 or day 7 post infection in the livers.
For the measurement of serum hormones, mice were bled retro-orbitally at the designated time of day (ZT = 0 (7 am), ZT = 12 (7 pm)).
To prepare bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC), C57BL/6J mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and femurs and tibias were isolated. The bones were cleansed with ethanol then washed with RPMI 1640 (Corning 10-040-CV), and pulverized in a mortar. Resulting contents were filtered through a 70 μm nylon cell strainer. After ACK lysing buffer (Lonza) for 5 min, contents were centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in BMDC growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO or BenchMark), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO), 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), 0.01 M HEPES (AmericanBio), 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 2% granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-conditioned media from GM-CSF producing cell lines (J558L) ( Gao et al., 2013 18. Gao, Y. ∙ Nish, S.A. ∙ Jiang, R. ... Control of T helper 2 responses by transcription factor IRF4-dependent dendritic cells Immunity. 2013; 39 :722-732 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (355) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, cells were seeded at 1 × 10 6 cells/ml concentration, and cultured for 6 days in 24 well cell culture plates. Half of media was replaced on 2 and 4 days. On day 5, cells were loaded with OVA or SIINFEKL peptide (OVAp, Anaspec). On day 6, BMDCs were sorted and co-cultured with naive CD8 T cells isolated and sorted from OT-I mice or C57BL/6 mice in RPMI 1640 media supplemented 7.5% FBS with 2 mM L-glutamine with 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Naive CD8 T cells were either sorted with MACS (EasySep Mouse Naive CD8+ T Isolation Kit, Stemcell technologies), following the manufacturer’s protocol, or sorted with FACS (FACS Aria II) after presorting with MACS (Pan T cell Isolation Kit II, Miltenyi Biotech). For the experiments with CD8 T cells taken from ADX mice, charcoal-stripped FBS was utilized (GIBCO). Naive CD8 T cells from OT-I mice were co-cultured with BMDC loaded with OVA or OVAp in the presence or absence of IL-12 (10-20 ng/ml). Naive CD8 T cells from B6 mice were co-cultured with BMDC and activated with anti-CD3ε (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of IL-12 (10-20 ng/ml). For ex vivo CD4 T cell assessment, naive CD4 T cells from OT-II mice with or without perinatal DEX treatment were sorted with FACS and co-cultured with BMDC loaded with OVA in the presence or absence of IL-12 (20 ng/ml) and anti-IL-4 antibody (5 μg/ml). In some circumstance, RU486 (Sigma), GR antagonist, at 1 μg/ml was treated during BMDC and OT-I co-culture. For the cell proliferation assay, OT-I CD8 T cells were labeled with Cell Trace Violet (ThermoFisher Scientific), and then co-cultured with BMDC with or without SIINFEKL loading. Proliferation of OT-I cells were assessed by the dilution of Violet signal.
Antibodies used for flow cytometry are cataloged in the antibodies section of the Key Resources Table . Cells were stained in round-bottom 96 well plates following manufacturer’s suggested protocol (BD Bioscience). Cell viability was determined using Zombie Yellow viability kit (Biolegend), and samples were Fc-blocked with mouse anti-CD16/32 (93) antibody (Thermofisher scientific). For all the intracellular cytokine staining in this study, cells were stimulated with PMA, Ionomycin and Golgi plug (PIG) for 4 hours, otherwise stated differently. For intracellular and phospho-flow staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with Foxp3 staining kit (Thermofisher scientific). All samples were acquired on an LSR II Flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star technology). In some cases, 123 count beads (Thermofisher scientific) was added to count the total cell number. For the staining for GR, permeabilized cells were either incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-GR antibody conjugated with FITC (G-5, Santa Cruz) or with Rabbit anti-GR antibody (D6H2L, Cell signaling) and anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab’)2 Fragment conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488 (#4412, Cell signaling).
Naive CD8 T cells from B6 mice or OT-I mice were sorted from spleens and/or LNs with FACS or MACS. BMDCs from 6 day culture were sorted with FACS or MACS. For FACS, single cell suspension was prepared by mincing the tissues on 70 μm filtered and lysed with ACK lysis buffer. Cells were then stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. Naive CD8 T cells (CD45+, CD8α+, CD62L+, CD44-) or BMDCs (CD45+ CD11c high ) were sorted with BD FACS Aria (BD Bioscience). In some cases, T cells were enriched before FACS by utilizing Pan T cell MACS kit (Miltenyi Biotec). For direct sorting of naive CD8 T cells with MACS, EasySep Naive CD8 T cell kit (Stemcell) was utilized, and for BMDC sorting with MACS, CD11c nanobead (Biolgend) was used following the manufacturer’s protocol.
For the detection of IFN-γ with ELISA, 96 well plate was first coated with anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody (XMG1.2) in coating buffer (Thermofisher Scientific). Then, standard recombinant IFN-γ and samples (R&D systems) were added to plates after blocking with 1% BSA blocking buffer. Plate was washed with 0.05% Tween-20-containing PBS, and biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-γ secondary antibody (R4-6A2-bi) was added. Streptavidin-HRP was then added after plate wash, and developed with TMB substrate. After the development, reaction was quenched with 2N H 2 SO 4 and quantified with 450 nm absorbance by the SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). For the detection of total CORT in serum with ELISA, Corticosterone EIA kit (Arbor assay) was utilized following the manufacturer’s protocol. For the detetection of ACTH in serum, RayBio ACTH hormone Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (RayBiotech) was utilized following manufacturer’s protocol.
Whole blood was harvested from mice by retro-orbital bleeding. For serum separation, blood was clotted for 15-30 minutes at room temperature or for overnight at 4°C, and serum was separated with the centrifugation with 5000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. Serum was analyzed immediately or stored in −80°C until the assessment. For the hematological assessment of blood, EDTA was added to blood, and immediately analyzed with a Hemavet 950FS (Drew Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
B16-F10 melanoma cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM and E.G7-OVA cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI1640, both were supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO), 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), and 0.01 M HEPES (AmericanBio). YUMMER1.7 cells were provided by Dr. Marcus W. Bosenberg. YUMMER1.7 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 Media with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO), 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), and 0.01 M HEPES (AmericanBio). For the in vivo injection, cells were diluted in OPTI-MEM (GIBCO) with the proper concentration of injection.
In vivo killing assay was performed as described previously with modification ( Kim et al., 2014 32. Kim, M.V. ∙ Ouyang, W. ∙ Liao, W. ... Murine in vivo CD8(+) T Cell Killing Assay Bio. Protoc. 2014; 4 :e1172 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). 18 week old CD45.2+ B6 mice were infected with LM-OVA. On day 7 after infection, splenocytes from 8 week old CD45.1+ B6 mice were loaded and labeled with Cell Trace Violet (Violet) (PBS (5 μM Violet) or SIINFEKL peptide (0.5 μM Violet)) and injected to the LM-OVA-infected mice retro-orbitally. Spleens of LM-OVA-infected mice were harvested after 4 hours of CD45.1+ splenocytes, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Killing activity was determined by the ratio between SIINFEKL peptide-loaded versus unloaded cell proportion.
OT-I (stock #003831) mice with or without perinatal DEX exposure were utilized as BM donors, and wild-type B6-CD45.1 (stock #002014) mice with or without perinatal DEX treatment were used as recipients. 6-week-old Recipient mice were irradiated with 10 Gy and 10 million donor BM cells were transplanted by intravenous injection. Mice were recovered for 6-10 weeks after transplantation and then utilized for further experiments.
LM-OVA CFU titers were determined by plating titrated amounts of liver homogenate on BHI plates. Briefly, liver was harvested at indicated times post-infection and weighed. Tissue homogenates were generated by mincing the tissues on a 70 μm cell strainer using the plunger of a 5 mL syringe. Titrated dilutions of tissue homogenate were generated in 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), plated on BHI plates, and grown overnight at 37°C.
Analysis of the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was performed with a Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer instrument in the context BMDC and OT-I co-culture as a measure of lactate production (a surrogate for the glycolytic rate) and OXPHOS respectively. In brief, BMDC (0.2 × 10 5 cells per well) and naive OT-I CD8 T cells (1 × 10 5 cells per well) were co-cultured in the presence or absence of SIINFEKL peptide overnight on a pretreated poly-Dlysine-coated 96-well polystyrene Seahorse plate in RPMI 1640 media supplemented 7.5% FBS with 2 mM L-glutamine with 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Prior to starting the assay, cells were washed and incubated in Seahorse Assay Medium supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 2mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate in 37°C incubator without CO 2 for 45 min. Oligomycin (ATPase inhibitor, 1 μM), FCCP (0.2 μM) and rotenone (0.5 μM) were injected where indicated and the ECAR (mpH/min) OCR (pMoles O 2 /min) was measured in real time.
For the induction of perinatal restraint stress, pregnant mice were placed into ventilated 50 mL conical tube for 3 hours/day during E12.5-E17.5. For perinatal cold exposure, pregnant mice or nursing mice with pups were placed 5°C in cold chamber (HPP750Life, Memmert) 6-12 hours/day with 12 hours light/dark condition. Control mice for cold exposure were placed in room temperature with 12 hours light/dark condition. For poly (I:C) injection, we injected either saline or poly (I:C) (20 μg in 10 μl; High Molecular weight, Invivogen) intraperitoneally on PND3 directly to pups.
Naive OT-I T cells or activated CD8 T cells were sorted from spleen and/or LNs as indicated in the specific experiments. RNA was purified from T cells using QIAGEN RNeasy columns (74106) with on-column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq libraries were constructed following Illumina Tru-seq stranded mRNA protocol (20020594). Paired-end sequencing was performed with Nextseq 500 with 38 bp reads from each end. Reads were mapped to the mouse transcriptome (GRCm38 ensembl release 89; cDNA and ncRNA) and quantified by Kallisto (v0.45.0) with a k-mer index 25 and 60 bootstrapping ( Bray et al., 2016 9. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (5202) PubMed Google Scholar ). The expression of each transcript is calculated in TPM (transcript per million). When multiple transcripts match to the same gene, the expression of the gene is calculated by summing the TPM of all matched transcripts. We also aligned the reads to the mm10 genome by STAR using Partek® Genomics Suite® software, version 7.0 (2018) and analyzed the result with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN).
Naive CD8 T cells from spleens and LNs were sorted with FACS. ATAC-seq libraries were constructed with 50K cells from each condition following Omni-ATAC protocol (Illumina FC-121-1031) ( Corces et al., 2017 15. Corces, M.R. ∙ Trevino, A.E. ∙ Hamilton, E.G. ... An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :959-962 Crossref Scopus (1214) PubMed Google Scholar ). The libraries were sequenced on Illumina Nextseq 500 (paired-end run, 38 bp). Sequenced reads were trimmed with adaptor sequences (cutadapt v1.9.1) ( Martin, 2011 38. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet.journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) and mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38, emsembl release 93) by Bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 33. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mitochondrial and duplicated reads were removed by SAMtools (v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 35. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38834) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Picard (v2.9.0, https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ), respectively. Peaks were found by MACS2 (v.2.1.1) ( Zhang et al., 2008 69. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (10883) PubMed Google Scholar ) and visualized by deepTools (v3.1.1) ( Ramírez et al., 2014 48. Ramírez, F. ∙ Dündar, F. ∙ Diehl, S. ... deepTools: a flexible platform for exploring deep-sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W187-W191 Crossref Scopus (1828) PubMed Google Scholar ; NAR). Motif enrichment analysis of ATAC-seq peaks was done by HOMER (v4.10) ( Heinz et al., 2010 22. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8020) PubMed Google Scholar ). P-values for motif enrichment were calculated using cumulative binomial distribution.
For GR and MR analysis, mice were perfused (transcardially with 4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4). Brains were kept in fixation solution overnight at 4 °C, then transferred to 30% sucrose solution for 24 h, sectioned (50 μm thickness) on a cryostat and stained while free-floating. Antibodies were as follows: 1:100 NR3C2 monoclonal antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA1-620), 1:200 rabbit anti-GR (ThermoFisher Scientific, PA1-511A). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A-21202), 647 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A-31573). dorsal DG, dorsal CA3, and dorsal CA1 were analyzed at −1.43 to −1.79 mm from bregma. PVH was analyzed at −0.59 to −0.95 mm from bregma. 3-5 sections per mouse were acquired and analyzed and the data per mouse was the average of the sections. All the samples were acquired using the same settings (laser power, 20% for MR, 10% for GR, optical slice, 1 μm) on an Leica SP8 on HC PL APO 40x/1.30 oil-immersion. Images were quantified using spot detection software (Imaris 9.2, Bitplane AG, expected radius 1 μm).
For tissue RNA extraction, tissues were harvested into RNA Bee RNA isolation reagent (Tel Test) and disrupted by bead homogenization in Lysing Matrix D tubes using a FastPrep-24 5G homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN). For RNA extraction from cultured cells, RNA was harvested using phenol-chloroform extraction according to manufacturer’s protocol (Tel Test). cDNA synthesis was performed using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Clontech) with oligo(dT) primers. qRT-PCR reactions were performed on either a CFX96 Real-Time System or CFX384 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) using PerfeCTa SYBR Green SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences) and transcript levels were normalized to Rpl13a. Primers used for qRT-PCR are cataloged in Table S1 .
Statistical information including n, mean, and statistical significance values are indicated in the text or the figure legends. Results were statistically analyzed using Student’s t test, Mann Whitney U-test, or an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with multiple comparisons where appropriate using Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc). Kaplan Meier survival curves were compared using log-rank Mantel-Cox test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
The accession number for the RNA-seq and ATAC-seq reported in this paper is GEO: GSE136980
