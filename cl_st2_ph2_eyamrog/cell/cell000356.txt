Title: The genomic history of the Aegean palatial civilizations


Abstract: Summary

The Cycladic, the Minoan, and the Helladic (Mycenaean) cultures define the Bronze Age (BA) of Greece. Urbanism, complex social structures, craft and agricultural specialization, and the earliest forms of writing characterize this iconic period. We sequenced six Early to Middle BA whole genomes, along with 11 mitochondrial genomes, sampled from the three BA cultures of the Aegean Sea. The Early BA (EBA) genomes are homogeneous and derive most of their ancestry from Neolithic Aegeans, contrary to earlier hypotheses that the Neolithic-EBA cultural transition was due to massive population turnover. EBA Aegeans were shaped by relatively small-scale migration from East of the Aegean, as evidenced by the Caucasus-related ancestry also detected in Anatolians. In contrast, Middle BA (MBA) individuals of northern Greece differ from EBA populations in showing ∼50% Pontic-Caspian Steppe-related ancestry, dated at ca. 2,600-2,000 BCE. Such gene flow events during the MBA contributed toward shaping present-day Greek genomes.

Section: Introduction

The Bronze Age (BA) period in Eurasia was marked by pivotal changes on the social, political, and economic levels, visible in the appearance of the first large urban centers and monumental palaces ( Harding, 2000 127. Harding, A.F. European Societies in the Bronze Age Cambridge University Press, 2000 Crossref Google Scholar ). The Aegean Sea—an embayment of the Mediterranean surrounded by mainland Greece, western Anatolia, and Crete ( Figure 1 A)—has played an important role in the formation of these innovations, particularly because some of the first monumental urban centers were formed around its shores ( Renfrew, 2011 270. Renfrew, C. The Emergence of Civilisation: the Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC Oxbow Books, 2011 Google Scholar ).
The BA civilizations in the Aegean, often termed Aegean Cultures , include the Minoan civilization in Crete (3,200/3,000–1,100 BCE) ( Wilson, 2008 344. Wilson, D. Early Prepalatial Crete Shelmerdine, C.W. (Editor) The Cambridge Companion to the Aegean Bronze Age Cambridge University Press, 2008; 77-104 Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar ), the Helladic civilization in mainland Greece (3,200/3,000–1,100 BCE) ( Wright, 2008 348. Wright, J.C. Early Mycenaean Greece Shelmerdine, C.W. (Editor) The Cambridge Companion to the Aegean Bronze Age Cambridge University Press, 2008; 230-257 Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar ) including the Mycenaean (i.e., the last phase of Helladic [1,600–1,100 BCE]), the Cycladic civilization in the Cycladic islands in the middle of the Aegean Sea (3,200/3,000–1,100 BCE) ( Broodbank, 2008 31. Broodbank, C. The Early Bronze Age in the Cyclades Shelmerdine, C.W. (Editor) The Cambridge Companion to the Aegean Bronze Age Cambridge University Press, 2008; 47-76 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ), and the western Anatolian cultures (3,000–1,200 BCE) ( Şahoğlu, 2008 280.

These cultures exhibit distinct characteristics in pottery style, burial customs, architecture, and art ( Cline, 2012 55. Cline, E.H.

The Cambridge Companion to the Aegean Bronze Age Cambridge University Press, 2008 Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar ). However, they share common innovations related to craft and agricultural (e.g., wine and oil) specializations, the creation of large storage facilities and redistribution systems as well as palaces, intensive trade, and the extensive use of metals. The increasing economic and cultural exchange that developed in the BA Aegean laid the groundwork for modern economic systems—including capitalism, long-distance political treaties, and a world trade economy ( Kristiansen, 2016 166.

(Editors) Human Mobility and Technological Transfer in the Prehistoric Mediterranean Cambridge University Press, 2016; 154-180 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ). In late BA (LBA), the earliest forms of writing appear—Linear A Minoan and Linear B Mycenaean scripts. Although Linear A has yet to be deciphered, Linear B (1,450 BCE) is the earliest attested form of Greek ( Ventris and Chadwick, 1953a 326. Ventris, M. ∙ Chadwick, J. Documents in Mycenaean Greek,Three Hundred Selected Tablets from Knossos, Pylos and Mycenae with Commentary and Vocabulary Cambridge University Press, 1953 Google Scholar , 1953b 327.

Stud. 1953; 73 :84-103 Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar )—one of the living languages with the longest documented history within the Indo-European family. These novelties define the early forms of urbanization, traditionally described as the urban revolution and the emergence of civilization ( Childe, 1942 51. Childe, V.G. 59.

The Emergence of Civilisation: the Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC Oxbow Books, 2011 Google Scholar ).
Based on extensive archaeological data, several hypotheses on the origin and development of these cultures have been proposed, including: (1) local innovation, where changes were based on genetic and cultural continuity of local Neolithic groups ( Dickinson, 2016 68.

In central, northern, and western Europe, most BA genomes are a mixture of local farmers, themselves descendants of Aegean Neolithic populations ( Hofmanová et al., 2016 134.

These components may be attributed to a migration wave of Pontic-Caspian Steppe populations during the late Neolithic and EBA (∼2,800 BCE) ( Allentoft et al., 2015 4.

Recently, Steppe-related ancestry was reported during the BA in the northern Balkans in Bulgaria ( Mathieson et al., 2015 200. Mathieson, I. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Rohland, N. ... Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians Nature. 2015; 528 :499-503 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ), on the Balearic Islands, and in Sicily ( Fernandes et al., 2020 90.

Genetic history from the Middle Neolithic to present on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :939 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it remains unclear how much further this ancestry extends either temporally or geographically into southeastern Europe.
Despite their importance for understanding the rise of western civilization and the spread of Indo-European languages, no BA whole genomes from the Aegean have been sequenced to date. Hence, the genetic origins of the peoples behind the Neolithic-BA transition and their contribution to the present-day Greek population remain controversial ( Coleman, 2000 56. Coleman, J.

Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neolithic whole genomes from present-day Greece and western Anatolia are almost indistinguishable, supporting a common Aegean Neolithic population spreading across the Aegean Sea ( Hofmanová et al., 2016 134. Hofmanová, Z. ∙ Kreutzer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ... Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :6886-6891 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Caucasus HG-related ancestry is present in some of the late Neolithic Aegean individuals, Chalcolithic Anatolians ( Kılınç et al., 2017 153. Kılınç, G.M. ∙ Koptekin, D. ∙ Atakuman, Ç. ...

Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising the possibility of gene flow from the East. LBA Mycenaeans also show evidence for an ancestry attributable to gene flow from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, or from Armenia ( Lazaridis et al., 2017 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, present-day Greeks were found to be quite genetically distinct from these previously reported Minoans and Mycenaeans, although the source of this difference was not investigated.
The dearth of genomic data from the Neolithic to the BA transition period in the Aegean has left key questions partially unanswered for understanding particular aspects of the BA demographic process in Europe, which we address: (1) Were the Aegeans who triggered the BA transition related to Neolithic groups from the same area? (2) What was the genetic affinity among the Helladic, Cycladic and Minoan EBA civilizations (i.e., did their cultural differences entail population structure, and how did they relate to LBA populations such as the Mycenaeans)? (3) Did the Eastern (Caucasus or Iran) ancestry observed in some Neolithic and Chalcolithic Anatolians persist until the EBA in the Aegean? What was the timing of such gene flow? (4) Did the massive migration from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe into central Europe have an influence on the Aegean BA populations? If so, what was the timing and magnitude of this gene flow? (5) How are Aegean individuals across the BA related to present-day Greeks who inhabit the same area?
To answer these questions and to characterize the populations who were behind the sophisticated palaces and urban centers of the Aegean BA, we generated whole genomes from BA Aegeans, including four from the EBA and two representing the Cycladic culture ( Figure 1 ). We used existing tools for phenotypic prediction on nuclear capture data and applied standard population genomic methods to characterize the relationship among ancient and present-day populations. To infer the demography of the Aegean from the Neolithic to the present-day, we capitalized on whole genome data and utilized approximate Bayesian computation ( Tavaré et al., 1997 300. Tavaré, S. ∙ Balding, D.J. ∙ Griffiths, R.C. ... Inferring coalescence times from DNA sequence data Genetics. 1997; 145 :505-518 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) coupled with deep learning (ABC-DL) ( Mondal et al., 2019 212. Mondal, M. ∙ Bertranpetit, J. ∙ Lao, O. Approximate Bayesian computation with deep learning supports a third archaic introgression in Asia and Oceania Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :246 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), which we have extended to account for the typical low depth of coverage, damage, and modern human contamination characterizing ancient genomes.

Section: Results and discussion

We screened 70 individual samples for the presence of human DNA. Six individual samples with a human DNA content higher than 1% were selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS) ( Table S1 ; STAR Methods ). For three of those, nuclear capture data was also generated. For these six individuals, we used sample material from the petrous bone for both radiocarbon dating and DNA sequencing ( Figure 1 ; Table 2 ; STAR Methods ): one EBA Helladic individual from the site of Manika on the island of Euboea ( Mik15 ), one EBA Minoan from the site of Kephala Petras (the burial rock shelter) on the island of Crete ( Pta08 ), two EBA Cycladic individuals from the island of Koufonisi ( Kou01 and Kou03 ), and two MBA individuals from the site of Elati-Logkas in northern Greece ( Log02 and Log04 ) ( Figures 1 A and S1 ). To improve clarity and to emphasize the archaeological site, culture, and time period of the sequenced individuals, we will refer to these individuals as: Helladic-Manika-EBA ( Mik15 ), Minoan-Petras-EBA ( Pta08 ), Cycladic-Koufonisi-EBA ( Kou01 and Kou03 ), and Helladic-Logkas-MBA ( Log02 and Log04 ). Moreover, four individuals ( Mik15 , Pta08 , Kou01 , and Kou03 ) will be jointly referred to as EBA Aegeans, distinguishing them from the more recent (by ∼1,000 years) individuals, Log02 and Log04 , who will be referred to as MBA Aegeans. Similar labels are utilized to group published genomic data from reference individuals ( Table 1 ). Moreover, to assist reproducibility, the labels of previously published populations are italicized throughout the text. In addition to generating data for the abovementioned six individuals, we captured the mtDNA genome for 11 individual samples ( Figure 1 ; Table S1 ; STAR Methods ).
The resulting depth of coverage for the Aegean BA genomes ranged between 2.6× and 4.9× (average: 3.7×) ( Tables 2 and S1 ; and STAR Methods ). The number of SNPs covered by at least one read is considerably higher for the six Aegean BA genomes than for the Aegean BA SNP capture data from Lazaridis et al. (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar when considering the “1240K” SNP capture set ( Mathieson et al., 2015 200. Mathieson, I. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Rohland, N. ... Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians Nature. 2015; 528 :499-503 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also across an “intergenic region” SNP set defined in this study ( Figure S2 A). The latter includes ∼5,270,000 SNP sites located at least 20 kb away from annotated genes and CpG islands ( STAR Methods ). Note that whole genomes from the populations studied hereafter have more low frequency variants in the intergenic regions than were detected in the 1240K SNP set for the same regions ( Figure S2 B). This likely owes to the SNP ascertainment scheme in the latter ( Clark et al., 2005 54. Clark, A.G. ∙ Hubisz, M.J. ∙ Bustamante, C.D. ... Ascertainment bias in studies of human genome-wide polymorphism Genome Res. 2005; 15 :1496-1502 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We observed typical ancient DNA damage patterns at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the DNA fragments, as well as short sequence reads (average length between 49.9 and 74.3 bases across genomes, after adaptor removal and mapping), attesting to the authenticity of the ancient data ( Figure S3 ; STAR Methods ). Across individuals, contamination rate estimates ranged between 0.6% and 1.1%, and between 0.01% and 1.49% when estimated using the X chromosome and mtDNA, respectively ( Table 2 ).
The overall genome-wide genetic relationship of the Aegean BA individuals was studied in the context of ancient and present-day Eurasian populations ( STAR Methods ). Despite their distinct cultures, the EBA Helladic, Cycladic, and Minoan genomes resemble one another in all analyses. Outgroup f 3 -statistics of the form f 3 (Yoruba;Y,X) , where X is one of the present-day populations included in Dataset I ( STAR Methods ) and Y the ancient individuals from this study, show that the Helladic-Manika-EBA, Minoan-Petras-EBA, and Cycladic-Koufonisi-EBA have a similar profile, which contrasts with the Helladic-Logkas MBA. EBA Aegeans have higher genetic similarity with present-day southern Europeans, particularly present-day Sardinians ( Figure S4 ). In the classical multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) analysis, the projected genetic dissimilarities between pairs of individuals estimated by an identity-by-state distance matrix in two dimensions ( STAR Methods ) show that the four EBA individuals ( Mik15 , Pta08 , Kou01 , Kou03 ) and the two MBA individuals ( Log02 and Log04 ) form two groups ( Figure 2 ) in agreement with the f 3 profiles. In line with the results above, ancestry proportions estimated by ADMIXTURE for K > 2 using Dataset II ( Table S2 ; STAR Methods ) suggest that the EBA Aegeans are genetically similar to one another and distinct from the MBA Aegeans ( Figures 3 and S5 ).
Compared to other ancient Eurasian populations, the EBA Aegeans are similar to other Aegean BA and Anatolian populations, but are quite distinct from all Balkan populations. For instance, in the MDS analysis, they fall within or near Minoan-Lasithi-MBA, Mycenaean-Peloponnese-LBA, and Anatolian populations such as Anatolia_Tepecik_Ciftlik ( Figure 2 ). Similarly, in the ADMIXTURE analysis, the EBA Aegeans show similar ancestry proportions to other Aegean populations, such as the Minoan-EMBA and Anatolia_Kumtepe , as well as Anatolian populations spanning the Chalcolithic and the EMBA (e.g., Anatolia_ChL , Anatolia_BA ) ( Figure 3 ).
The genomic EBA homogeneity across cultures in the Aegean and parts of Anatolia may indicate that Aegean populations used the sea as a route to interact not only culturally but also genetically. This could have been the result of an intense network of communication in the Aegean, which has been well documented on the archaeological level and has been dubbed the “International Spirit of the Aegean” ( Renfrew, 1972 266. Renfrew, C. The Emergence of Civilisation: the Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC Oxbow Books, 1972 Google Scholar ). Moreover, given the high similarity between Minoan-Petras-EBA and the Cycladic-Koufonisi-EBA, the genomic data also informs debates related to the formation of colonies from the Cycladic islands to Crete ( Doumas, 2010 71. Doumas, C. Crete and the Cyclades in the Early Bronze Age: A view from the North Krzsyzkowska, O.

Beyond cultures and ethnicity: a new look at material culture distribution and inter-regional interaction in the Early Bronze Age Southern Aegean Antoniadou, S. ∙ Pace, A. (Editors) Mediterranean Crossroads Pierides Foundation, 2007; 419-451 Google Scholar ).
ADMIXTURE results indicate that the EBA Aegean population consists mostly of an ancestry component shared with Neolithic Aegeans (accounting for >65%), whereas most of the remaining ancestry can be assigned to Iran Neolithic/Caucasus HG-related populations (17%–27%) ( Figure 3 ). These results were replicated with qpWave/qpAdm ( STAR Methods ) using Dataset I ( Tables 3 and S3 ). When considering early Neolithic populations and HG populations as potential sources, EBA individuals were in general found to be consistent with the majority of their ancestry deriving from populations related to Anatolia_N (∼69%–84%) ( Table 3 ). This suggests that the people behind the Neolithic to BA transition largely had ancestors from the preceding Aegean farmers, in line with archaeological theories for the EBA transformation ( Dickinson, 2016 68. Dickinson, O. ‘The Coming of the Greeks’ and All That Bintliff, J. ∙ Rutter, N.K. (Editors) The Archaeology of Greece and Rome: Studies In Honour of Anthony Snodgrass Edinburgh University Press, 2016; 3-21 Crossref Google Scholar ; Renfrew, 1972 266. Renfrew, C.

The Mycenaean age: a study of the monuments and culture of pre-Homeric Greece Houghton Mifflin, 1897 Google Scholar ) ( Document S1 ). The second component in qpWave/qpAdm could be assigned to Iran_N / CHG -related populations (∼16%–31%) ( Table 3 ). In line with this result, in the MDS analysis ( Figure 2 ), the Aegean EBA individuals are on an axis connecting Neolithic Aegeans to the Iran Neolithic/Caucasus HG (“Caucasus-axis”).
To further test for gene flow events from outside of the Aegean, D-statistics were computed. In particular, we tested whether an H3 population (e.g., Iran_N or CHG —the blue component in ADMIXTURE ) ( Figure 3 ) shares more alleles with H1 = Anatolia_N ( D > 0) or with Aegean/Anatolian populations from different time periods (H2 = Greece_N , BA Aegeans/Anatolians, present-day Greeks and Cypriots) ( D < 0), using the ancient Ethiopian Mota ( Gallego Llorente et al., 2015 184. Gallego Llorente, M. ∙ Jones, E.R. ∙ Eriksson, A. ... Ancient Ethiopian genome reveals extensive Eurasian admixture in Eastern Africa Science. 2015; 350 :820-822 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ) as an outgroup D ( Anatolia_N , H2 ; H3 , Mota ) ( Figure S6 ). The EBA Aegean genomes were found to be similar to one another. Although EBA Aegeans carry the “Iran Neolithic/Caucasus HG-like” component in other analyses (e.g., Figure 3 ), no statistically significant evidence for gene flow from Iran_N or CHG was detected. However, a visible trend suggests that Aegeans dating to ∼4,000 BCE onward (from Anatolia_ChL to Mycenaean ) share more alleles with Iran_N/CHG than with Anatolia_N ( Figure S6 ). This trend is replicated in the ADMIXTURE results ( Figure 3 ), where small proportions of CHG -like components were observed from the Neolithic onward in individuals on both sides of the Aegean and in Anatolia but not in the Balkans. This CHG- like component increases in frequency during the early Neolithic in Anatolia (e.g., Boncuklu, Tepecik-Ciftlik) ( Kılınç et al., 2016 152. Kılınç, G.M. ∙ Omrak, A. ∙ Özer, F. ...

Biol. 2016; 26 :2659-2666 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), the late Neolithic in the Aegean (e.g., Greece_N ) ( Hofmanová et al., 2016 134. Hofmanová, Z. ∙ Kreutzer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ... Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :6886-6891 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Omrak et al., 2016 224. Omrak, A. ∙ Günther, T. ∙ Valdiosera, C. ... Genomic evidence establishes Anatolia as the source of the European Neolithic gene pool Curr. Biol. 2016; 26 :270-275 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), and during the BA in Anatolia ( Anatolia_BA ) ( Lazaridis et al., 2017 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is not seen in the Balkans, where the transition from Neolithic to BA is mostly associated with an increase in “European HG-like” ancestry ( Figure 3 ).
To compare competing scenarios, and to infer the mode and tempo of potential gene flow events into the Aegean while accounting jointly for the population history of Neolithic, BA, and present-day populations from Greece, we performed ABC-DL ( Mondal et al., 2019 212. Mondal, M. ∙ Bertranpetit, J. ∙ Lao, O. Approximate Bayesian computation with deep learning supports a third archaic introgression in Asia and Oceania Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :246 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Document S1 ; STAR Methods ). To determine the relationship between HG and Aegean Neolithic, we first contrasted 3-leaf models ( Figure 4 A; Table S4 ) of the three ancestral populations: CHG, EHG, and Aegean Neolithic. In this analysis, the 3-leaf model (EHG, CHG, and Aegean Neolithic) had the greatest posterior probability (P(M|D) = 0.999). This result is in agreement with Jones et al. (2015) 144. Jones, E.R. ∙ Gonzalez-Fortes, G. ∙ Connell, S. ... Upper Palaeolithic genomes reveal deep roots of modern Eurasians Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8912 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar , who found a closer relationship between CHG and “Early Farmer” from Stuttgart, than with WHG . We used this tree for the more complex 7-leaf models ( Figure 4 B; Table S4 ). In line with all of the above results, 7-leaf models without a CHG- like pulse of gene flow (models B1, B2, and B3) ( Figure 4 B) were associated with lower posterior probabilities (0.000–0.014). In contrast, a model including such gene flow, estimated at 16% (0.2%–29%, 95% highest posterior density interval) ( Table S4 ) at ∼5,700 BCE (8,299–2,881 BCE, 95% highest posterior density interval) ( Table S4 ) was assigned much higher support (posterior probability of 0.98 for model B4) ( Document S1 ; STAR Methods ). Taken together, these results suggest that a population related to the Caucasus HG had either directly influenced the Aegean through migration, or a CHG- like component was indirectly introduced through exchanges with Neolithic Anatolian populations.
In central, western, and northern BA Europe, the CHG component is generally accompanied by an EHG component ( Allentoft et al., 2015 4. Allentoft, M.E. ∙ Sikora, M. ∙ Sjögren, K.G. ... Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia Nature. 2015; 522 :167-172 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ; Haak et al., 2015 125. Haak, W. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe Nature. 2015; 522 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jones et al., 2015 144. Jones, E.R. ∙ Gonzalez-Fortes, G. ∙ Connell, S. ... Upper Palaeolithic genomes reveal deep roots of modern Eurasians Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8912 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ) – which would be expected to appear in similar proportions if transmitted through Steppe-related populations ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018 61. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ... The first horse herders and the impact of early Bronze Age steppe expansions into Asia Science. 2018; 360 :eaar7711 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, EBA Aegeans carry little to no EHG ancestry. Based on the D-statistics analysis, we cannot reject that most EBA Aegean genomes and Anatolia_N are equally close to EHG ( Figure S6 ). Moreover, when considering three potential sources in qpWave/qpAdm , EBA individuals carry only ∼1%–8% EHG versus 24%–25% CHG ancestry (i.e., substantially less EHG ancestry) ( Table 3 ). This is further supported by ADMIXTURE results ( Figure 3 ), indicating that changes from Neolithic to EBA were mostly associated with increases in IranN / CHG -like ancestry in the Aegean and Anatolia, whereas the Balkans and the rest of Europe were mostly associated with increases in EHG -like ancestry ( Figure 3 ). Finally, all ABC-DL models including an EHG pulse into the ancestor of EBA Aegeans (models B5 and B6) ( Figure 4 ) have negligible posterior probability support (0.000–0.002). Taken together, these results suggest little influence of populations related to EHG during the EBA in the Aegean, further implying that the Caucasus component arrived in the Aegean independently.
Considerably more population structure is observed in the Aegean during the MBA compared to the EBA. MBA individuals from northern Greece are quite distinct from the EBA Aegeans, as can be seen across all analyses. For example, in the f 3 analysis, unlike the EBA Aegeans, they are equally distant to a much larger set of populations across Europe ( Figure S4 ). In MDS ( Figure 2 ) and ADMIXTURE ( Figure 3 ) analyses, they form a separate group distinct from the EBA Aegeans, sharing the same components as the present-day Greeks. In contrast, the Minoan-Lasithi-MBA are very similar to the EBA Aegean populations ( Figures 2 and 3 ).
The primary feature distinguishing the Helladic-Logkas-MBA from the contemporary Minoan-Lasithi-MBA, as well as from the EBA populations, is the higher proportion of “European HG-like” ancestry. For instance, in ADMIXTURE , the “European HG-like” component accounts for 26%–34% of the overall Logkas ancestry, more than four times greater than the 2%–6% found in the Aegean EBA individuals ( Figure 3 ). Similarly, in qpWave/qpAdm , a Helladic-Logkas-MBA individual ( Log04 ) was consistent with a 3-way admixture model, deriving ∼58% of her ancestry from Aegean Neolithic populations; the remaining ancestry can be attributed to CHG -like and EHG -like sources (accounting for ∼16% and ∼27%, respectively)—that is, having a much greater contribution from EHG as compared to the EBA Aegeans ( Table 3 ). Because EHG and CHG are the major components of Steppe-related populations (e.g., Steppe_EMBA with 66% EHG -like and 34% IranN / CHG -like0 ( Figure 3 ), consistent with previous results ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018 61. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ... The first horse herders and the impact of early Bronze Age steppe expansions into Asia Science. 2018; 360 :eaar7711 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), this supports the hypothesis that populations from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe contributed to the ancestry of the Helladic-Logkas-MBA individuals. This combined ancestry has been observed in central, western, and northern BA Europeans and interpreted as the result of a “massive” Steppe migration ( Allentoft et al., 2015 4. Allentoft, M.E. ∙ Sikora, M. ∙ Sjögren, K.G. ... Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia Nature. 2015; 522 :167-172 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ; Haak et al., 2015 125.

The genomic history of the Iberian Peninsula over the past 8000 years Science. 2019; 363 :1230-1234 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our ADMIXTURE estimates are consistent with an increase of EHG components in the Late Neolithic and EBA in most regions of Europe, including in the Balkans ( Figure 3 ; Document S1 ). Yet, in Anatolia, such an increase in EHG -like ancestry is residual, and in the Aegean, it is only seen later in the MBA (Helladic-Logkas-MBA) and LBA (Mycenaean) individuals, suggesting a later arrival of Steppe-related ancestry in the Aegean.
Evidence for such a Steppe contribution is provided, for example, in MDS ( Figure 2 ), where the Helladic-Logkas-MBA fell on a “Steppe-axis” connecting Neolithic Aegeans with Steppe populations. In ADMIXTURE ( Figure 3 ), the Helladic-Logkas-MBA carries similar relative amounts of the “Iran Neolithic/Caucasus HG-like” (∼1/3) and “European HG-like” (∼2/3) components as Steppe_EMBA . Moreover, unlike the Neolithic and the EBA Aegeans and Anatolians, as well as the Minoan-Lasithi-MBA, the Helladic-Logkas-MBA share significantly more alleles with CHG, EHG and Steppe_EMBA compared to Anatolia_N ( Figure S6 ). In addition, the Helladic-Logkas-MBA Log04 individual could also be directly modeled as 2-way admixture (proximate sources) of Anatolia_N (∼53%) and Steppe_EMBA (∼47%), or Anatolia_N (∼38%), and Steppe_MLBA (∼62%), consistent with a strong genetic contribution from the Steppe ( Table 3 ). Furthermore, demographic modeling suggests that gene flow (8%–45%, 95% highest posterior density interval) ( Table S4 ) from a ghost population related to Steppe_EMBA , prior to the MBA split, considerably improves the fit of the model to the data (model B4 versus model B1) ( Figure 4 B). The timing of such gene flow into the ancestors of the Helladic-Logkas-MBA ought to have occurred by ∼1,900 BCE, based on the radiocarbon dates of the Logkas individuals, and was estimated at ∼2,300 BCE (2,616–2,003 BCE 95% highest posterior density interval) ( Table S4 ) in the ABC-DL analysis. This suggests that a Steppe-like migration wave may have reached the Aegean by the MBA. Because Steppe-related ancestry is essentially absent in Sardinia ( Fernandes et al., 2020 90. Fernandes, D.M. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Olalde, I. ... The spread of steppe and Iranian-related ancestry in the islands of the western Mediterranean Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2020; 4 :334-345 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Marcus et al., 2020 199. Marcus, J.H. ∙ Posth, C. ∙ Ringbauer, H. ... Genetic history from the Middle Neolithic to present on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :939 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), and because we have no evidence of Steppe-like or EHG-like ancestry among Minoans, this may suggest that Steppe-related populations did not cross the sea during the BA. Supporting this hypothesis, the archaeological record does not indicate that BA populations from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe were sea-faring people ( Anthony, 2010 9. Anthony, D.W. The horse, the wheel, and language: How Bronze-Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world Princeton University Press, 2010 Crossref Google Scholar ).
Note, however, that the Steppe-like ancestry observed in the Logkas individuals may have been brought directly by migrating populations originally from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe or indirectly by populations with substantial Steppe-like gene flow (e.g., Balkans_LBA or Europe_LNBA ) ( Table 3 ). Alternatively, the Steppe-like component may have been brought by an unsampled, genetically similar, population (e.g., MBA Balkans). The indirect contribution is supported by ADMIXTURE estimates that suggest an earlier influence of Steppe-related ancestry in the Balkans than in the Aegean ( Figure 3 ), and by qpWave/qpAdm modeling of the MBA Log04 individual as 2-way admixture involving Balkan LBA ( Table 3 ). This finding is consistent with the suggestion of intermittent genetic contact between the Balkans and the Steppe populations during the BA ( Mathieson et al., 2018 201. Mathieson, I. ∙ Alpaslan-Roodenberg, S. ∙ Posth, C. ... The genomic history of southeastern Europe Nature. 2018; 555 :197-203 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is in line with archaeological evidence of cultural contacts between southeastern Europe and the Pontic-Caspian Steppe around 2,500 BCE ( Anthony, 2010 9. Anthony, D.W. The horse, the wheel, and language: How Bronze-Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world Princeton University Press, 2010 Crossref Google Scholar ). This may further be related to previous hypotheses based on both archaeological and linguistic evidence that populations with Steppe-like ancestry contributed to the formation of the Helladic culture ( Coleman, 2000 56. Coleman, J. An Archaeological Scenario for the “Coming of the Greeks” ca. 3200 B.C J. Indo-European Stud. 2000; 28 :101-153 Google Scholar ) ( Document S1 ).
To assess sex-biased gene flow among the BA Aegeans, mtDNA, Y-, and X-chromosomes were analyzed. The 17 inferred mtDNA ( Tables 2 and S2 ) and the two Y-chromosome haplogroups ( Table 2 ) are common among European Neolithic individuals and do not show any clear evidence of sex-biased gene flow from outside of the Aegean ( Document S1 ). To further investigate sex-biased gene flow, we compared the ancestry on the X chromosome versus the autosomes with a supervised ADMIXTURE following Goldberg et al. (2017) 115. Goldberg, A. ∙ Günther, T. ∙ Rosenberg, N.A. ... Ancient X chromosomes reveal contrasting sex bias in Neolithic and Bronze Age Eurasian migrations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :2657-2662 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar . We found no evidence for sex-biased gene flow in EBA Aegeans, with point estimates of Iran_N/CHG -like ancestry on the X chromosome overlapping with those of autosomes ( Figure 5 A). In contrast, among MBA Aegeans, although Log04 has similar amounts of Steppe-like ancestry on the X chromosome and the autosomes, Log02 is inferred to harbor no Steppe-like ancestry on the X chromosome versus 25%–52% Steppe - like ancestry on the autosomes ( Figure 5 B). Moreover, in the mtDNA, we found no significant ( STAR Methods ) population structure (AMOVA p value = 0.293) between EBA and MBA Aegeans from the North of Greece (Pella, Paliambela, Xeropigado Koiladas, and Elati-Logkas) ( Figure 1 ; Document S1 ). Together, these patterns on the X chromosome and mtDNA could be explained by male-biased gene flow from Steppe-like ancestry into the Aegean. Similarly, Goldberg et al. (2017) 115. Goldberg, A. ∙ Günther, T. ∙ Rosenberg, N.A. ... Ancient X chromosomes reveal contrasting sex bias in Neolithic and Bronze Age Eurasian migrations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :2657-2662 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar and Olalde et al. (2019) 222. Olalde, I. ∙ Mallick, S. ∙ Patterson, N. ... The genomic history of the Iberian Peninsula over the past 8000 years Science. 2019; 363 :1230-1234 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar suggested that the immigration of Pontic-Caspian Steppe populations during the Late Neolithic/EBA in Europe may have involved a much larger number of males than females.
To gain further genetic clues about marital practices during the EBA and the MBA, we inferred contiguous genomic regions in homozygous states—also called runs of homozygosity (ROH)—in four present-day Greek and the six BA Aegean whole genomes ( Figure S7 ). Log04 had more (twenty-nine versus seven at most) and longer ROH (two ROH above 5 Mb) ( Document S1 ) than other ancient individuals. Different evolutionary/demographic processes ( Ceballos et al., 2018 43. Ceballos, F.C. ∙ Joshi, P.K. ∙ Clark, D.W. ... Runs of homozygosity: windows into population history and trait architecture Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19 :220-234 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pemberton et al., 2012 241. Pemberton, T.J. ∙ Absher, D. ∙ Feldman, M.W. ... Genomic patterns of homozygosity in worldwide human populations Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 91 :275-292 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ), including recent inbreeding ( Yengo et al., 2019 352. Yengo, L. ∙ Wray, N.R. ∙ Visscher, P.M. Extreme inbreeding in a European ancestry sample from the contemporary UK population Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3719 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), could explain the Log04 data; in any case, Log02 does not harbor similarly long ROH, suggesting that the underlying cause may not generally characterize the Helladic-Logkas-MBA ( Document S1 ).
The last phase of the BA is associated with a Late Helladic culture termed Mycenaean. Around 1,200 BCE, the Mycenaean civilization began to decline, the palaces were destroyed, the system of writing (Linear B) was abandoned, and their arts and crafts ceased. The causes of their decline are disputed (e.g., climatic change, invasions) ( Middleton, 2020 208. Middleton, G.D. Collapse and Transformation: The Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age in the Aegean Oxbow Books, 2020 Google Scholar ). Lazaridis et al. (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar showed that Mycenaeans were quite distinct from present-day populations, but it remained unclear how they relate to EBA populations.
Despite cultural similarity with the Helladic-Logkas-MBA individuals, analyses suggest that the Mycenaean-Peloponnese-LBA were quite distinct genetically, occupying a position in-between the Logkas and the EBA Aegean and the Minoan-Lasithi-MBA in MDS ( Figure 2 ). Unlike the Logkas individuals, they carry a lower European-HG-like component in ADMIXTURE ( Figure 3 ) and do not share significantly more alleles with Iran_N/CHG or EHG compared to Anatolia_N in the D -statistics ( Figure S6 ). However, like the Helladic-Logkas-MBA, they share more alleles with Steppe_EMBA . Mycenaean-Peloponnese-LBA had previously been shown to be consistent with a qpWave/qpAdm model that either involved BA Steppe- or Armenian-related populations ( Lazaridis et al., 2017 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recapitulated this result and we additionaly found that Mycenaean-Peloponnese-LBA data are also consisent with a model involving an EBA Aegean and Anatolia_N as source populations ( Table 3 ). In contrast, the Helladic-Logkas-MBA require a Steppe-like source and cannot be explained with a simple model involving an Armenian-like source ( Tables 3 , S3 , and S5 ).
There are further alternative explanations consistent with the data. First, the Mycenaean-Peloponnese-LBA could be the descendants of populations closely related to the MBA Logkas population and to an EBA Aegean population—a 2-way admixture between populations related to Helladic-Logkas-MBA (∼21%–36%) and the Minoan_Odigitria_EMBA and Minoan_Lasithi_MBA (∼64%–79%). Similarly, a 2-way admixture between the Helladic-Logkas-MBA Log04 individual (∼34%–36%) and EBA Aegeans (∼64%–66%) could not be rejected ( Table S3 ). Second, populations related to Armenia BA may have contributed to the Aegeans in a geographically localized fashion during the LBA or earlier ( Table S5 ). This scenario was proposed in the archaeological literature ( Drews, 1988 72. Drews, R. The Coming of the Greeks: Indo-European Conquests in the Aegean and the Near East Princeton University Press, 1988 Crossref Google Scholar ) and would imply that the Mycenaeans would not have left much trace in individuals from later generations.
Lazaridis et al., (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar found present-day Greek populations to be quite distinct from later phases of the BA in the Aegean. In contrast, our results reveal that present-day individuals from Greece (northern Greece—Thessaloniki—and Crete) are closely related to the Helladic-Logkas-MBA individuals of northern Greece, falling near present-day Greeks in MDS analysis ( Figure 2 ), sharing the same ancestry components in ADMIXTURE ( Figure 3 ), and having very similar D-statistics ( Figure S6 ). Moreover, in qpWave/qpAdm analyses ( Table 3 ), the Thessaloniki individuals could be successfully modeled with ∼93%–96% MBA Logkas-related ancestry, and a small fraction (4%–11%) of a second component (either EHG or Eurasian Upper Paleolithic populations such as Kostenki14 [ Fu et al., 2016 100. Fu, Q. ∙ Posth, C. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... The genetic history of Ice Age Europe Nature. 2016; 534 :200-205 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ] or MA1 [ Raghavan et al., 2014 259. Raghavan, M. ∙ DeGiorgio, M. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ... The genetic prehistory of the New World Arctic Science. 2014; 345 :1255832 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ]). The latter are basal populations that constitute a distant outgroup to the Aegean genomes and appear to be interchangeable in this analysis across tests. This suggests that modern populations from northern Greece and Crete could be descendants of Aegean EBA populations, with subsequent admixture with populations related to the Pontic-Caspian Steppe EMBA. Interestingly, modern Cypriots carry no evidence for Steppe-like gene flow across analyses ( Figures 2 , 3 , and S6 ; Table 3 ).
Using genotype data, we predicted that Pta08 , Kou01 , and Log02 most likely had brown eyes, dark brown to black hair, and dark skin ( Table S1 ; STAR Methods ). These predictions match the visual representations of male individuals from BA wall paintings of Minoan Crete for hair and eye color. The eye and hair color predictions were similar to those from later periods of the Aegean BA ( Lazaridis et al., 2017 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the overall prediction for all three individuals was of dark skin, they also all carried alleles strongly associated with lighter skin color (rs1426654 in the gene SLC24A5, and rs16891982 in SLC45A2 ) ( Mathieson et al., 2015 200.

The latter is in line with observations that skin depigmentation has been segregating since the Neolithic in southern Europe ( Hofmanová et al., 2016 134. Hofmanová, Z. ∙ Kreutzer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ... Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

All three individuals carried the ancestral state in homozygous form (including the MBA Logkas) both at −13910T and at −22018A.

During the EBA, the Aegean saw key innovations in trade, craft specialization, social structure, and urbanization. These changes—that mark the end of the Neolithic Period—left indelible marks on Europe and signaled the start of the urban revolution. At the beginning of this cultural transformation, the Aegean world was mostly split between three iconic palatial civilizations, the Helladic, the Cycladic, and the Minoan, each distinguishable by their artwork, pottery style, burial customs, and architecture ( Cline, 2012 55. Cline, E.H. The Oxford Handbook of the Bronze Age Aegean Oxford University Press, 2012 Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar ; Shelmerdine, 2008 293. Shelmerdine, C.W. The Cambridge Companion to the Aegean Bronze Age Cambridge University Press, 2008 Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar ).
To better understand the origin of the people behind this transformation, we sequenced four EBA individuals covering all three Aegean BA cultures (Helladic, Cycladic, and Minoan), two MBA individuals from northern Greece, as well as 11 mtDNA genomes from EBA Aegeans. The increased number of variants covered by the whole genomes from this study compared to previous SNP capture data from later periods in the BA Aegean ( Figure S2 A), as well as the inherent random variant selection characterizing whole genomes ( Figure S2 B), allowed us to perform demographic inference and statistically contrast population histories. Moreover, the whole genomes generated here can be easily combined with any genomic data (whole genomes, capture data—1240K or otherwise) with a limited loss of variants in future studies of human population history. Note that future work will be required to determine how representative the analyzed genomes of the Aegeans are of the BA Cycladic, Minoan, and Helladic cultures as a whole.
In summary, these genomes from the Cycladic, Minoan, and Helladic (Mycenaean) BA civilizations suggest that these culturally different populations were genetically homogeneous across the Aegean and western Anatolia at the beginning of the BA. The EBA genomes drew their ancestry mainly from local Aegean farmers and from populations related to the CHG. These findings are consistent with long-standing archaeological theories regarding the Neolithic-Bronze Age transformation, namely the immigration of new peoples from Anatolia and the Caucasus ( Blegen and Haley, 1928 22. Blegen, C.W. ∙ Haley, J. The coming of the Greeks: II. The geographical distribution of prehistoric remains in Greece Am. J. Archaeol. 1928; 32 :146-154 Crossref Google Scholar ; Caskey, 1971 41. Caskey, J.L. Greece, Crete and the Aegean islands in the Early Bronze Age Edwards, I.E.S. ∙ Gadd, C.J. ∙ Hammond, N.G.L.

(Editors) Documents in Mycenaean Greek Cambridge University Press, 1957; xvii Google Scholar ). However, because the contribution of the local Neolithic populations was significant ( Dickinson, 2016 68. Dickinson, O. ‘The Coming of the Greeks’ and All That Bintliff, J. ∙ Rutter, N.K. (Editors) The Archaeology of Greece and Rome: Studies In Honour of Anthony Snodgrass Edinburgh University Press, 2016; 3-21 Crossref Google Scholar ; Renfrew, 1972 266. Renfrew, C.

The Mycenaean age: a study of the monuments and culture of pre-Homeric Greece Houghton Mifflin, 1897 Google Scholar ), both local and incoming elements appear to have contributed to the EBA innovations.
In contrast, the MBA Aegean population was considerably more structured. One likely reason for such structure is additional Pontic-Caspian Steppe-related gene flow into the Aegean, for which evidence was seen in the newly sequenced MBA Logkas genomes. Present-day Greeks—who also carry Steppe-related ancestry—share ∼90% of their ancestry with MBA northern Aegeans, suggesting continuity between the two time periods. In contrast, LBA Aegeans (Mycenaeans) may carry either diluted Steppe- or Armenian-related ancestry ( Lazaridis et al., 2017 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). This relative discontinuity could be explained by the general decline of the Mycenaean civilization as previously proposed in the archaeological literature ( Middleton, 2019 207. Middleton, G.D. Collapse of the Bronze Age Aegean Oxford Classical Dictionary Oxford University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ). Finally, the inferred migration waves all predate the appearance of Linear B script (1,450 BCE) ( Chadwick, 2014 44. Chadwick, J.L. The Decipherment of Linear B Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Google Scholar ). As a result, the genomic data could support both dominant linguistic theories explaining the emergence of Proto-Greek and the evolution of Indo-European languages ( Gray et al., 2011 119. Gray, R.D. ∙ Atkinson, Q.D. ∙ Greenhill, S.J. Language evolution and human history: what a difference a date makes Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2011; 366 :1090-1100 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Namely, that these languages either originated in Anatolia ( Renfrew, 1972 266. Renfrew, C. The Emergence of Civilisation: the Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC Oxbow Books, 1972 Google Scholar , 1989 268. Renfrew, C. The Origins of Indo-European Languages Sci. Am. 1989; 261 :106-115 Crossref Google Scholar , 2000 269. Renfrew, C. At the Edge of Knowability: Towards a Prehistory of Languages Camb. Archaeol. J. 2000; 10 :7-34 Crossref Google Scholar ) (correlating with the Anatolian and Caucasus-like genetic ancestries) or they originated in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe region ( Anthony, 2010 9. Anthony, D.W. The horse, the wheel, and language: How Bronze-Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world Princeton University Press, 2010 Crossref Google Scholar ) (correlating with the Steppe-like ancestry). Future Mesolithic to BA genomes from Armenia and the Caucasus regions in general could help to further pinpoint the origins and the mode of gene flow into the Aegean and to better integrate the genomic data with the existing archaeological and linguistic evidence.

Skeletal material from ten archaeological sites representing the Bronze Age civilizations were chosen ( Cline, 2012 55. Cline, E.H.

For a detailed chronology, terminology and archaeological background on Aegean cultures see Document S1 .
We produced whole genomes from four archaeological sites (Petras, Manika, Koufonisi, Elati-Logkas) and mtDNA genomes from six archaeological sites (Agios Kosmas, Koufonisi, Manika, Paliambela-Kolindrou, Pella, Xeropigado Koiladas, see Figure 1 ). The individual samples from two archaeological sites (Koumasa and Tsikniades) yielded no DNA. Information for the archaeological sites and individual samples is available at Document S1 .
We were given permission by the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports to sample and extract DNA as well as to radiocarbon date all human remains mentioned in this study according to Greek law for destructive sampling of archaeological material (Ν.3028/02).
Radiocarbon dates of the petrous bone samples used for WGS, newly reported in this study are summarized in Table S1 . We report the uncalibrated 14 C age, the calibrated ranges (1 and 2 sigma) using OxCal v4.3.2. ( Ramsey, 2017 261. Ramsey, C.B. Methods for Summarizing Radiocarbon Datasets Radiocarbon. 2017; 59 :1809-1833 Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar ) and INTCAL13 ( Reimer et al., 2013 264. Reimer, P.J. ∙ Bard, E. ∙ Bayliss, A. ... IntCal13 and Marine13 Radiocarbon Age Calibration Curves 0–50,000 Years cal BP Radiocarbon. 2013; 55 :1869-1887 Crossref Scopus (8492) Google Scholar ), and the C/N ratio and the % carbon as additionally quality criteria for showing collagen preservation ( Table S1 ).
Extraction of collagen from the samples Mik15, Kou03, Log04 and Pta08 was performed in the BioArch facility of the University of York before being sent to the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum-Mannheim for 14 C dating. Collagen was extracted from four human petrous bones using a modified Longin (1971) 185. Longin, R. New method of collagen extraction for radiocarbon dating Nature. 1971; 230 :241-242 Crossref Scopus (1094) PubMed Google Scholar method as in Kontopoulos et al. (2019) 156. Kontopoulos, I. ∙ Penkman, K. ∙ Liritzis, I. ... Bone diagenesis in a Mycenaean secondary burial (Kastrouli, Greece) Archaeol. Anthropol. Sci. 2019; 11 :5213-5230 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar . The exterior surfaces of the bone samples were mechanically cleaned using a scalpel. Bone chunks of 300-500 mg were demineralized in 8 mL 0.6 M HCl at 4°C. Samples were agitated twice daily and the acid solution was changed every two days. After demineralization, the supernatant was drained off and samples were rinsed (x3) with distilled water. Gelatinization was carried out by adding 8 mL pH3 HCl, and samples were placed in hot blocks at 80°C for 48h. The supernatant was filtered using Ezee™ filters and was freeze-dried for two days in pre-weighed plastic tubes. Collagen yields (weight in % of dry bone), which are commonly used to distinguish well-preserved from poorly-preserved collagen were estimated using the formula: bone mass (mg)/collagen mass (mg) x 100, where bone mass is the weight of bone chunks after cleaning the exterior surfaces, and collagen mass is the extracted material that remains following demineralization, gelatinization and filtering.
Samples Kou01 and Log02 were sent as a piece of petrous bone to the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Mannheim for 14 C dating. Collagen was extracted following standard protocols of the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Mannheim.
All pre-PCR sample preparation steps were carried out in the clean room facilities of the Palaeogenetics Group at the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, which is physically separated from any post PCR laboratories as previously described ( Scheu et al., 2015 286. Scheu, A. ∙ Powell, A. ∙ Bollongino, R. ... The genetic prehistory of domesticated cattle from their origin to the spread across Europe BMC Genet. 2015; 16 :54 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ancient DNA was extracted using two different extraction methods:
Protocol A: We used 0.5g bone powder as input for DNA extraction and followed a previously published protocol ( Hofmanová et al., 2016 134. Hofmanová, Z. ∙ Kreutzer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ... Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :6886-6891 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Scheu et al., 2015 286. Scheu, A. ∙ Powell, A. ∙ Bollongino, R. ... The genetic prehistory of domesticated cattle from their origin to the spread across Europe BMC Genet. 2015; 16 :54 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. For lysis 6mL EDTA (0.5M, pH8), 250μL N-Laurylsarcosine (5%) and 30μL Proteinase K (14-22mg/mL) were added to the powder and left under constant shaking for 48h at 37°C. After a subsequent phenol/chloroform (phenol/chloroform/ isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1) extraction the aqueous phase was transferred to a 50kD Amicon filter unit (Merck Millipore) for clean-up and concentration up to a final volume of 200μL DNA extract. Optionally, an additional pre-lysis step was performed: prior to lysis, the powder was washed for 45min at 37°C using 1mL EDTA, 250μL N-Laurylsarcosine and 30μL 20 Proteinase K, the powder was then pelleted and the supernatant discarded. Extractions I and II of Kou01 , Log02 and Pta08 followed Protocol A. Extraction Kou01 _II followed Protocol A with an additional pre-lysis step. DNA extractions for the mtDNA capture experiments followed extraction protocol A.
Protocol B: DNA extraction was performed using 0.15 g bone powder. Pre-lysis was performed by adding 1mL EDTA (0.5M, pH8) to the bone powder and incubating the suspension at 37°C for 30min under constant shaking ( Kou03 _IV, Log04 _III, Mik15 _I and Pta08 _III) or for 10min without shaking ( Log02 _III). Afterward, each sample was incubated with 1mL lysis buffer consisting of 950μL EDTA (0.5M, pH8), 20μL Tris-HCl (1M, pH8), 17μL N-Laurylsarcosine (5%) and 13μL Proteinase K (14-22mg/ml) at 37°C for 24h under constant shaking, followed by a concentration and washing step using 1x Tris EDTA on 30kD Amicon filter units (Merck Millipore). The extracts were then purified using silica columns (MinElute PCR Purification Kit). For extract Log02 _III the lysis step was repeated after 24h by removing the supernatant, adding 1 mL additional lysis buffer to the bone powder pellet and incubating for another 24h, followed by merging both extracts prior to the Amicon filter wash.
DNA extracts were converted into double-indexed sequencing libraries according to Kircher et al. (2012) 154. Kircher, M. ∙ Sawyer, S. ∙ Meyer, M. Double indexing overcomes inaccuracies in multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :e3 Crossref Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar with modifications. For WGS blunt-end repair was performed using the NEBNext End Repair Module: 20 μL of DNA extract are mixed with NEBNext End Repair Reaction Buffer (10X, 7μL), NEBNext End Repair Enzyme Mix (3.5μL) and nuclease-free water (39.5μL; for a final reaction volume of 70 μL) and incubated for 15 min at 25°C followed by 5 min at 12°C. Hybridized adapters P5 and P7 were used at a concentration of 0.75 μM. The WGS libraries were amplified in 12 PCR parallels each with an individual index combination using AccuPrimeTM Pfx SuperMix and 3 μL fill-in product per parallel (final reaction volume: 25 μL; final primer concentration: 200 nM each). The PCR was performed in 10-11 cycles and the temperature profile followed the manufacturer’s recommendations but using an annealing temperature of 60°C, extending for 30 s during each cycle and performing a final elongation step for 5min. The DNA extract of Log02 was treated with USER™ enzyme prior to library preparation for WGS drastically reducing the effects of DNA deamination ( Briggs et al., 2010 29. Briggs, A.W. ∙ Stenzel, U. ∙ Meyer, M. ... Removal of deaminated cytosines and detection of in vivo methylation in ancient DNA Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :e87 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 ): 16,25μl of DNA extract were mixed with 5μl USER™ Enzyme and incubated for 3 h at 37°C ( Verdugo et al., 2019 329. Verdugo, M.P. ∙ Mullin, V.E. ∙ Scheu, A. ... Ancient cattle genomics, origins, and rapid turnover in the Fertile Crescent Science. 2019; 365 :173-176 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). The blunt-end repair step followed immediately. After adaptor fill-in and before library amplification, a sample was taken for qPCR, to infer the number of DNA molecules successfully transferred into sequencing libraries ( Hofmanová et al., 2016 134. Hofmanová, Z. ∙ Kreutzer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ... Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :6886-6891 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
We processed a total of 70 individual bone samples; 15 samples contained no DNA that could be transferred into libraries for sequencing. The remaining 55 genomic libraries (pooled equimolar) were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq™ platform (50 bp, SE) at StarSEQ GmbH (Mainz, Germany) to measure the human DNA content. Demultiplexing was performed by the sequencing facility. Based on the screening results, we selected six individual samples with high endogenous DNA content (ranging from 12.6% to 55.9%; Table S1 ) for whole genome shotgun sequencing ( Kou01 , Kou03 , Log02 , Log04 , Mik15 , and Pta08 ; all from petrous bone samples). DNA sequencing for whole genome sequence data were performed using Illumina’s HiSeq2500 at the Lausanne Genomics Technologies Facility (GTF) at the University of Lausanne ( Mik15 , Pta08 , Kou01 , Kou03, Log04 ) as well as an Illumina HiSeq3000 at the Next Generation Sequencing Platform (Institute of Genetics) at the University of Bern ( Log02 ).
For three individual samples ( Pta08 , Kou01 and Log02 ), a capture experiment was conducted targeting 5,329 putative neutral, autosomal regions, as well as 388 autosomal SNPs associated with phenotypes of interest ( i.e ., 5,717 regions in total). These were enriched by in-solution hybridization capture as described in Veeramah et al. (2018) 325. Veeramah, K.R. ∙ Rott, A. ∙ Groß, M. ... Population genomic analysis of elongated skulls reveals extensive female-biased immigration in Early Medieval Bavaria Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :3494-3499 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar . The targeted regions span around 4.9Mb of the nuclear genome, each region ranges from 80 to 1,001 bp, with 79% of them spanning 1,001 bp each. For these captured libraries, a 100 bp single-end rapid run was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer at the Institute for molecular genetics, genetic engineering research and consulting (IMSB) (now Molecular Genetics and Genome Analysis Group) at the University Mainz, Germany.
In addition to nuclear data, the mitochondrial genome was captured for 11 samples using Agilent’s SureSelect™ in-solution target enrichment kit (custom design) ( Gnirke et al., 2009 114. Gnirke, A. ∙ Melnikov, A. ∙ Maguire, J. ... Solution hybrid selection with ultra-long oligonucleotides for massively parallel targeted sequencing Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27 :182-189 Crossref Scopus (962) PubMed Google Scholar ) as detailed in Hofmanová et al. (2016) 134. Hofmanová, Z. ∙ Kreutzer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ... Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :6886-6891 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar . Prior to enrichment 2-4 libraries originating from 2-3 independent extractions ( Table S1 ) were prepared for each sample according to Kircher et al., (2012) 154. Kircher, M. ∙ Sawyer, S. ∙ Meyer, M. Double indexing overcomes inaccuracies in multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :e3 Crossref Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar as described in Hofmanová et al. (2016) 134. Hofmanová, Z. ∙ Kreutzer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ... Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :6886-6891 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and pooled equimolarly. Sequencing and demultiplexing of the mtDNA capture samples were performed on an Illumina MiSeq™ platform (50 bp, SE) at StarSEQ GmbH (Mainz, Germany).
Sequencing reads from screening, WGS, nuclear and mtDNA capture experiments, as well as those from eight published genomes ( Table S1 ), were mapped with an in-house mapping pipeline implemented in the workflow manager snakemake ( Mölder et al., 2021 211. Mölder, F. ∙ Jablonski, K.P. ∙ Letcher, B. ... Sustainable data analysis with Snakemake F1000Res. 2021; 10 :33 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and consisting of the following steps. First, sequence reads were checked for quality before and after removal of adapters using fastqc version 0.11 ( Andrews, 2010 7. Andrews, S. Fastqc. A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data 2010 https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ Google Scholar ). Illumina adapters were removed with AdapterRemoval version 2.1.7 ( Schubert et al., 2016 290. Schubert, M. ∙ Lindgreen, S. ∙ Orlando, L. AdapterRemoval v2: rapid adapter trimming, identification, and read merging BMC Res. Notes. 2016; 9 :88 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ) filtering out ambiguous bases (N, –trimns), bases of low quality (phred score ≤ 2) from both ends of the reads (—trimqualities), and reads shorter than 30 base pairs (bp, –minlength 30). Reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh37 for the screening, WGS and nuclear capture data; and to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS, NC_012920.1) for the mtDNA capture data) using BWA ALN version 0.7.15 ( Li and Durbin, 2010 179. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate long-read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :589-595 Crossref Scopus (5580) PubMed Google Scholar ) with disabled seeding (-l 1024) to reduce the effect of post-mortem damage-related error ( Schubert et al., 2012 289. Schubert, M. ∙ Ginolhac, A. ∙ Lindgreen, S. ... Improving ancient DNA read mapping against modern reference genomes BMC Genomics. 2012; 13 :178 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignments with a quality score below 30 were discarded with samtools version 1.4 ( Li et al., 2009 181. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (24116) PubMed Google Scholar ), PCR duplicates were removed at the library level using ‘Picard tools’ MarkDuplicates version 2.9.0 ( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard ) and local realignment around indels was performed using GATK version 3.7 ( DePristo et al., 2011 65. DePristo, M.A. ∙ Banks, E. ∙ Poplin, R. ... A framework for variation discovery and genotyping using next-generation DNA sequencing data Nat. Genet. 2011; 43 :491-498 Crossref Scopus (6026) PubMed Google Scholar ). The md flag of the alignments was recomputed using calmd from samtools version 1.4 ( Li et al., 2009 181. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (24116) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the WGS data, reads were also trimmed at both ends by 5 bp after adapted removal and prior to mapping in order to reduce the impact of post-mortem damage-related error. In this case, reads shorter than 30 bp after 5 bp-trimming were discarded using fastx_trimmer version 0.0.13.2 ( http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit ). Statistics for the screening, WGS, nuclear and mtDNA capture experiments (including the performance of the nuclear capture experiment) can be found in Table S1 .
We used the software package ANGSD v. 0.921 ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 157. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar ) to assess the overall and type-specific error rates of the WGS and nuclear capture data. This method uses an outgroup species to estimate the expected number of derived alleles in the human genome. Any excess of derived alleles in the sample is then interpreted as the result of errors. We obtained the expected number of derived alleles in the human genome by using a modern individual (SS6004480) from Prüfer et al. (2014) 254. Prüfer, K. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Patterson, N. ... The complete genome sequence of a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains Nature. 2014; 505 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar and the chimp genome (mapped to GRCh37) as outgroup species. As expected for aDNA ( Orlando et al., 2015 225. Orlando, L. ∙ Gilbert, M.T.P. ∙ Willerslev, E. Reconstructing ancient genomes and epigenomes Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16 :395-408 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), underlying the effects of post-mortem damage, C to T and G to A substitutions accounted for most of the observed errors in the individual samples ( Figure S3 ). For the untrimmed WGS data, we estimated overall error rates from 0.6% to 0.91% ( Figure S3 ). Note that the Log02 extract was USER™ -treated, which drastically decreased the error rate (0.11%). After trimming 5 bp from each end of the reads, the overall error rates were reduced from 0.35% to 0.11% (excl. Log02 , Figure S3 ). The trimmed dataset was used for downstream WGS population genetic analyses. For the untrimmed nuclear capture data, the overall error rates were generally higher and ranged from 0.87% to 1.18% ( Figure S3 ), which might reflect the fact that the nuclear capture data were sequenced on an older platform (Illumina HiSeq2500) than the one used for the WGS data (Illumina HiSeq3000).
The data were inspected for characteristics of ancient DNA (e.g., being fragmented and damaged) using the bamdamage software package ( Malaspinas et al., 2014 188. Malaspinas, A.-S. ∙ Tange, O. ∙ Moreno-Mayar, J.V. ... bammds: a tool for assessing the ancestry of low-depth whole-genome data using multidimensional scaling (MDS) Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2962-2964 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 ; Table S1 ). These features can also be informative about the authenticity of the DNA. The distribution of read lengths was unimodal for each sequencing lane and the reads were shorter than the number of cycles used for sequencing, as expected for ancient DNA ( Figure S3 ; Table S1 ). Furthermore, the damage patterns across the reads showed increased C to T and G to A substitutions at the read termini, consistent with the degradation pattern for ancient DNA (e.g., Briggs et al., 2010 29. Briggs, A.W. ∙ Stenzel, U. ∙ Meyer, M. ... Removal of deaminated cytosines and detection of in vivo methylation in ancient DNA Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :e87 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the results from the ANGSD error analysis, the damage pattern for the USER™-treated Log02 individual was one order of magnitude lower compared to the other individuals.
The software package ContamMix v. 1.0-10 ( Fu et al., 2013 99. Fu, Q. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Johnson, P.L.F. ... A revised timescale for human evolution based on ancient mitochondrial genomes Curr. Biol. 2013; 23 :553-559 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to quantify the level of contamination using the mtDNA chromosome for the WGS and mtDNA capture data. This method assumes that the coverage is high enough to call the true endogenous mtDNA consensus sequence and that the data contains less than 50% contamination. A set of 311 worldwide modern mitochondrial genomes ( Green et al., 2008 120. Green, R.E. ∙ Malaspinas, A.-S. ∙ Krause, J. ... A complete Neandertal mitochondrial genome sequence determined by high-throughput sequencing Cell. 2008; 134 :416-426 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ) serves as source of potential contamination. Sequence reads are therefore modeled as a mixture of any of these 311 genomes and the endogenous consensus sequence of unknown proportions. For this analysis, the data were mapped to the whole genome for both the WGS and the mtDNA capture data to reduce the effect of nuclear DNA of mitochondrial origin (NUMT). The data were either trimmed prior to mapping (WGS) or using Contamix (mtDNA capture). The inferred fractions of exogenous mitochondrial sequences correspond to the amount of contamination. We first built a mtDNA consensus sequence using ANGSD v. 0.921 (-doFasta 2), which was then aligned to the panel of 311 mtDNA sequences via mafft v. 7.310 ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 151. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (15340) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both the alignment and the mapped reads were then used in a MCMC framework to estimate the level of contamination. The Markov chain was run for 10,000 (for the estimates based on trimmed data, see below) to 100,000 (when restricting the analyses to transversions only, see below) iterations (after burn-in) using the default value 0.1 for the hyperparameter alpha of the Dirichlet prior distribution. For the WGS individual samples, we estimated the contamination with modern mtDNA within the 95% credibility interval to be below 1.5% ( Table S1 ). These findings are in line with estimates from earlier reported ancient samples (e.g., Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018 213. Moreno-Mayar, J.V. ∙ Vinner, L. ∙ de Barros Damgaard, P. ... Early human dispersals within the Americas Science. 2018; 362 :eaav2621 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) and suggest that population genetic analyses of the WGS data may not be substantially affected. As damage was high (up to 50% at the end of the reads) for the mtDNA capture data ( Table S1 ), we report three estimates: trimming 5 bp (as for the WGS data) or 10 bp at the read termini and finally only considering transversions. Point estimates for contamination for the mtDNA capture data are below ∼5% in most cases ( Table S1 ). The exceptions are three mitochondrial genomes with relatively low coverage: AGI02 (4%–15% contamination after 5 bp trimming), PAL04 (4%–8% contamination after 5 bp trimming), and XER01 (2%–13% contamination after 5 bp trimming) ( Table S1 ). However, in all three cases the point estimates are lower after 10 bp trimming and even lower when considering only transversions, suggesting that damage might not be accounted for properly for those estimates or that the DoC is too low to call the true consensus. In any case, the data for these three samples should be interpreted with care.
For this analysis we used contaminationX, an X chromosome-based method described in Moreno-Mayar et al. (2020) 214. Moreno-Mayar, J.V. ∙ Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Dalal, J. ... A likelihood method for estimating present-day human contamination in ancient male samples using low-depth X-chromosome data Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :828-841 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ( https://github.com/sapfo/contaminationX ) to estimate contamination for the two males ( Kou01 and Pta08 ). As described in Moreno-Mayar et al. (2020) 214. Moreno-Mayar, J.V. ∙ Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Dalal, J. ... A likelihood method for estimating present-day human contamination in ancient male samples using low-depth X-chromosome data Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :828-841 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar , the HapMap data ( International HapMap 3 Consortium et al., 2010 140. International HapMap 3 Consortium ∙ Altshuler, D.M. ∙ Gibbs, R.A. ... Integrating common and rare genetic variation in diverse human populations Nature. 2010; 467 :52-58 Crossref Scopus (1818) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used as a reference panel. In brief, this method leverages the fact that the X chromosome (excluding the pseudoautosomal regions) is hemizygous in males. Thus, the occurrence of multiple alleles at a given site on the X chromosome can be attributed to either error or contamination. Base counts are modeled as a function of an error rate estimated from the data, the allele frequencies in the contaminant population, and the contamination fraction, which is estimated with a maximum likelihood optimization. Since estimates obtained through this method have been shown to vary slightly with the assumed ancestry of the contaminant ( Moreno-Mayar et al., 2020 214. Moreno-Mayar, J.V. ∙ Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Dalal, J. ... A likelihood method for estimating present-day human contamination in ancient male samples using low-depth X-chromosome data Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :828-841 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), we considered the allele frequencies of three HapMap populations: YRI, CHB and CEU. We ran the ‘two-consensus’ method, considered sites with a depth of coverage ≥ 3X and ≤ 20X, and obtained a 95% confidence interval through 1,000 block-jackknife replicates following Moreno-Mayar et al., (2020) 214. Moreno-Mayar, J.V. ∙ Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Dalal, J. ... A likelihood method for estimating present-day human contamination in ancient male samples using low-depth X-chromosome data Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :828-841 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar . Results are summarized in Tables 1 and S2 . For both individuals, contamination estimates had little variation across panels and were below 1.1%. Given the magnitude of these estimates, we assumed that contamination had little impact on subsequent analyses.
Consensus sequences for the mtDNA were called from the bam files using ANGSD v. 0.921 ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 157. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar ), with parameters “-doFasta 2” and “-doCounts 1.” We used HaploGrep v2.1.19 ( Weissensteiner et al., 2016 340. Weissensteiner, H. ∙ Pacher, D. ∙ Kloss-Brandstätter, A. ... HaploGrep 2: mitochondrial haplogroup classification in the era of high-throughput sequencing Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 W58–63 Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar ) to infer the mtDNA haplogroups of the samples ( Document S1 ). In order to determine the Y chromosome haplogroups bcftools v. 1.4 ( Li et al., 2009 181. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (24116) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to perform haploid calls (i.e., specifying–ploidy 1) on the Y chromosome of the two males ( Pta08 and Kou01 ). The sequenced data were compared to approximately 60,000 Y chromosome variants reported for the phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes project ( Poznik et al., 2016 251. Poznik, G.D. ∙ Xue, Y. ∙ Mendez, F.L. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium Punctuated bursts in human male demography inferred from 1,244 worldwide Y-chromosome sequences Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :593-599 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). To call haplogroups for Kou01 and Pta08 , the analysis was restricted to sites with a minimum depth of 5 reads and minimum base quality scores of 20. Moreover, analysis was restricted to sites with at least 80% of the reads supporting one of the two alleles at a 1000 Genomes project SNP variant. We then performed a binary tree search as in Schroeder et al. (2015) 288. Schroeder, H. ∙ Ávila-Arcos, M.C. ∙ Malaspinas, A.-S. ... Genome-wide ancestry of 17th-century enslaved Africans from the Caribbean Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :3669-3673 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar against the 1000 Genomes Y-phylogeny ( Poznik et al., 2016 251. Poznik, G.D. ∙ Xue, Y. ∙ Mendez, F.L. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium Punctuated bursts in human male demography inferred from 1,244 worldwide Y-chromosome sequences Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :593-599 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ) to determine the Y chromosome haplogroups of the two individuals. Further information about mtDNA and Y chromosome haplogroups can be found in Document S1 and Table S1 .
To understand the structure among the mtDNA sequences, we first built a phylogenetic tree and then conducted an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA, Excoffier et al., 1992 85. Excoffier, L. ∙ Smouse, P.E. ∙ Quattro, J.M. Analysis of molecular variance inferred from metric distances among DNA haplotypes: application to human mitochondrial DNA restriction data Genetics. 1992; 131 :479-491 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The phylogenetic tree ( Document S1 ) was built for the 17 mtDNA sequences in Table S1 (six and eleven from the WGS and mtDNA capture data, respectively) using an additional two San mitochondrial genomes (AY195783 and AY195789) ( Mishmar et al., 2003 210. Mishmar, D. ∙ Ruiz-Pesini, E. ∙ Golik, P. ... Natural selection shaped regional mtDNA variation in humans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :171-176 Crossref Scopus (734) PubMed Google Scholar ) as outgroups. The sequences were first aligned using SeaView v5.0.4 ( Gouy et al., 2010 117. Gouy, M. ∙ Guindon, S. ∙ Gascuel, O. SeaView version 4: A multiplatform graphical user interface for sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree building Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27 :221-224 Crossref Scopus (3672) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then converted to phylip format using the R package ape v5.3 ( Paradis and Schliep, 2019 236. Paradis, E. ∙ Schliep, K. ape 5.0: an environment for modern phylogenetics and evolutionary analyses in R Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :526-528 Crossref Scopus (1246) PubMed Google Scholar ). PhyML v3.1 ( Guindon et al., 2010 121. Guindon, S. ∙ Dufayard, J.-F. ∙ Lefort, V. ... New algorithms and methods to estimate maximum-likelihood phylogenies: assessing the performance of PhyML 3.0 Syst. Biol. 2010; 59 :307-321 Crossref Scopus (9746) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the R package phangorn 2100 v2.5.5 ( Schliep, 2011 287. Schliep, K.P. phangorn: phylogenetic analysis in R Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :592-593 Crossref Scopus (1280) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to determine the best mutational model for our data. In our case, F84 + I + Γ was the best model. The sequences were loaded on PhyML v3.1 and the tree was generated using this model with a BioNJ starting tree, SPR moves, and 10,000 bootstrap replicates. The resulting tree (with all nodes with bootstrap support below 50% collapsed) can be found in Document S1 . The resulting tree topology is also mostly coherent with publicly available data ( Eupedia, 2018 80. Eupedia Distribution of European mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups by region in percentage 2018 https://www.eupedia.com/europe/european_mtdna_haplogroups_frequency.shtml Google Scholar ) and haplotypes cluster together. However, samples from the same archeological site do not strictly form clades.
For the AMOVA, the individual samples were pooled into two groups according to their geographic location, culture and time period: EBA Helladic North (3 Pella, 2 Paliambela, 4 Xeropigado Koiladas); and MBA Helladic North (2 Elati-Logkas). See map on Figure 1 in the main text for grouping and locations. Using the mtDNA sequences aligned with SeaView v5.0.4 ( Gouy et al., 2010 117. Gouy, M. ∙ Guindon, S. ∙ Gascuel, O. SeaView version 4: A multiplatform graphical user interface for sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree building Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27 :221-224 Crossref Scopus (3672) PubMed Google Scholar ), we carried an AMOVA with Arlequin v.3.5.2.2 ( Excoffier and Lischer, 2010 84. Excoffier, L. ∙ Lischer, H.E.L. Arlequin suite ver 3.5: a new series of programs to perform population genetics analyses under Linux and Windows Mol. Ecol. Resour. 2010; 10 :564-567 Crossref Scopus (10191) PubMed Google Scholar ), using 10,000 permutations of individual mtDNA sequences between groups to assess significance. Pairwise F ST between pairs of groups was estimated based on pairwise distances of mtDNA sequences, using 10,000 permutations to assess significance. The data type was set to DNA in haplotypic format, with a total of 16,479 variable sites. The results indicate limited differentiation between EBA and MBA in northern Greece, with an explained variance among groups of 2.96% corresponding to an estimated F ST of 0.0296 (p = 0.293).
The six WGS ancient individuals were studied in the context of previously published modern and ancient data of two kinds: i) genotypes/variants (mostly from SNP array capture data), and ii) whole genome sequence data. To serve the purpose of different analyses, different datasets were assembled: Dataset 0: Three reference panels made available by David Reich’s laboratory were combined. These data include 2,068 modern individuals (621,799 SNPs) genotyped on the Human Origins SNP array ( https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/NearEastPublic.tar.gz ; Lazaridis et al., (2016) 176. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Nadel, D. ∙ Rollefson, G. ... Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East Nature. 2016; 536 :419-424 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , 351 ancient individuals (1,150,639 SNPs) whose data derive from the ‘1240K’ SNP capture assay ( https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/MinMyc.tar.gz ; Lazaridis et al., (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar as well as 225 ancient individuals (1,233,013 SNPs) from Mathieson et al., (2018) 201. Mathieson, I. ∙ Alpaslan-Roodenberg, S. ∙ Posth, C. ... The genomic history of southeastern Europe Nature. 2018; 555 :197-203 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ( https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/Genomic_Hist_SE_Europe_Mathieson.tar.gz ). The data were downloaded in the PACKEDANCESTRYMAP format and we used EIGENSOFT package 7.2.1 ( Patterson et al., 2006 238. Patterson, N. ∙ Price, A.L. ∙ Reich, D. Population structure and eigenanalysis PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e190 Crossref Scopus (2552) PubMed Google Scholar ; Price et al., 2006 252. Price, A.L. ∙ Patterson, N.J. ∙ Plenge, R.M. ... Principal components analysis corrects for stratification in genome-wide association studies Nat. Genet. 2006; 38 :904-909 Crossref Scopus (6133) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameter settings to merge these datasets and to convert them into the Plink format. This merged dataset contained 621,272 SNPs in total, with 616,427 SNPs being autosomal. Note that the 19 ancient individuals published in Lazaridis et al. (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB20914 ) as well as four additional individuals B_Crete-1 ( SAMEA3302765 ) and B_Crete-2 ( SAMEA3302625 ) ( Mallick et al., 2016 189. Mallick, S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Lipson, M. ... The Simons Genome Diversity Project: 300 genomes from 142 diverse populations Nature. 2016; 538 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB9586 ); YamnayaKaragash_EBA and Sidelkino ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018 61. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ... The first horse herders and the impact of early Bronze Age steppe expansions into Asia Science. 2018; 360 :eaar7711 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), together with the BA Aegean six samples ( Kou01 , Kou03 , Mik15 , Pta08 , Log02 , Log04 ) were joined from the BAM files after applying the following post-processing steps for these samples. Given the relative low depth of coverage for most of these individuals ( Figure S2 ), rather than calling genotypes, one read at random for each SNP position was sampled, following the steps described below. First, we filtered the BAM files to keep only the aligned bases (minimum base quality of 20) mapping to the position of the SNPs in the reference panel using samtools 1.10 ( Li et al., 2009 181. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (24116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, we randomly sampled one allele at each position per individual and coded it as homozygote reference (“0/0”) or homozygote alternative (“1/1”), if it matched the reference or alternative allele in the filtered reference panel, respectively, or as missing data (“./.”) otherwise. Third, we merged the resulting table of genotypes with the reference panel. Fourth, given that the modern reference panel contained called genotypes, including heterozygotes, we simulated the sampling of just one read per individual (as done for the sub-set of ancient individuals mentioned above). This was done by randomly converting heterozygous sites into 0/0 or 1/1 with 50% probability. These data (Dataset 0) were further processed in two ways to fit the purpose of different analyses. Dataset I: For the f/D -statistics, we tried to maximize the number of SNPs used in each analysis. Following Lazaridis et al. (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar , this dataset used the following additional filters on Dataset 0: for analyses involving both present-day and ancient data, the so-called “HO” set of 591,642 SNPs was used; for analyses involving ancient individuals only, the so-called “HOIll” set of 1,054,671 SNPs was used (see Lazaridis et al. [2017] 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar for details on the SNP sets) of which 1,054,637 SNPs were retained for this merged dataset. Dataset II: For this dataset, to discard rare alleles that were likely due to sequencing/mapping errors and to reduce linkage, both minor allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium filters (MAF of 0.05 and r 2 > = 0.4) were applied on Dataset 0 using PLINK v1.90 ( Purcell et al., 2007 257. Purcell, S. ∙ Neale, B. ∙ Todd-Brown, K. ... PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81 :559-575 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16638) PubMed Google Scholar ) (–maf 0.05–indep-pairwise 200 25 0.4). To avoid biases due to the increased damage patterns for ancient DNA, these filters were only applied to the 2,068 present-day individuals from the Human Origins panel, retaining 165,447 SNPs. These data were then rejoined to the ancient individuals. Moreover, individuals marked as related and outliers were removed and we kept only present-day individuals of primarily Eurasian individuals as determined by an ADMIXTURE run with K = 3. We selected the present-day individuals with more than 90% Eurasian ancestry component, thus excluding individuals that did not cluster with those from the same continent ( Table S2 ). A panel restricted to this set of individuals was then created by including 1346 individuals (564 ancient and 782 present-day) from Dataset 0. Finally, to allow for a more balanced sample size per population, a maximum of 20 individuals per population were retained removing the individuals with the most missing data. The resulting dataset of 969 individuals (331 ancient and 638 present-day) was used for ADMIXTURE. For MDS , we further applied a filter to exclude individuals with a proportion of missing haploid genotype calls greater than 0.95 using PLINK v1.90, removing 47 ancient low-quality samples from the panel ( Table S2 , “Excluded mind 0.95” tab) and removed populations of less relevance for this analysis. In Table S2 , all individuals from Dataset 0 that were used in ADMIXTURE and MDS are listed. Dataset III: This set included four ancient and four modern publicly available full-genomes that were remapped with the same procedure as the six genomes from this study ( Table S1 , “Additional genomes” tab): YamnayaKaragash_EBA (3,018-2,887 BCE) ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018 61. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ... The first horse herders and the impact of early Bronze Age steppe expansions into Asia Science. 2018; 360 :eaar7711 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), KK1 ( CHG ; 7,745-7,579 BCE) ( Jones et al., 2015 144.

Commun. 2015; 6 :8912 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ), Bar8 (Neolithic Barçın; 6,122-6,030 BCE) ( Hofmanová et al., 2016 134. Hofmanová, Z. ∙ Kreutzer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ... Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :6886-6891 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), Sidelkino ( EHG ; 9,386-9,231 BCE) ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018 61. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ... The first horse herders and the impact of early Bronze Age steppe expansions into Asia Science. 2018; 360 :eaar7711 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), S_Greek-1 and S_Greek-2 ( SAMEA3302732 and SAMEA3302763; present-day Greeks from Thessaloniki) ( Mallick et al., 2016 189. Mallick, S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Lipson, M. ... The Simons Genome Diversity Project: 300 genomes from 142 diverse populations Nature. 2016; 538 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ), B_Crete-1 and B_Crete-2 ( SAMEA3302765I and SAMEA3302625; modern Cretans) ( Mallick et al., 2016 189. Mallick, S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Lipson, M. ... The Simons Genome Diversity Project: 300 genomes from 142 diverse populations Nature. 2016; 538 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ). The modern genomes from this dataset were used for the ROH analysis. The ancient genomes selected had similar or higher mean depth of coverage than the whole genomes sequenced in this study and were therefore more suitable for demographic history reconstruction. Dataset IV: This dataset (used for ABC-DL) consisted of the four ancient genomes described above and the present-day Greek ( S_Greek-1 ) from Dataset III as well as two genomes reported in this study, Mik15 (to represent Aegean EBA) and Log04 (to represent Aegean MBA).
After remapping (see above), we followed the gv cf methods ( Poplin et al., 2017 250. Poplin, R. ∙ Ruano-Rubio, V. ∙ DePristo, M.A. ... Scaling accurate genetic variant discovery to tens of thousands of samples BioRxiv. 2017; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) for variant calling in each of the BAM files. First, every BAM file was called for variants using HaplotypeCaller ( Poplin et al., 2017 250. Poplin, R. ∙ Ruano-Rubio, V. ∙ DePristo, M.A. ... Scaling accurate genetic variant discovery to tens of thousands of samples BioRxiv. 2017; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), which produced a gVCF file for a single individual. We then merged all the gVCF files using GenotypeGVCFs ( Poplin et al., 2017 250. Poplin, R. ∙ Ruano-Rubio, V. ∙ DePristo, M.A. ... Scaling accurate genetic variant discovery to tens of thousands of samples BioRxiv. 2017; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) with default parameters.
The final VCF file was re-calibrated following Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) recommendations ( DePristo et al., 2011 65. DePristo, M.A. ∙ Banks, E. ∙ Poplin, R. ... A framework for variation discovery and genotyping using next-generation DNA sequencing data Nat. Genet. 2011; 43 :491-498 Crossref Scopus (6026) PubMed Google Scholar ). We converted the VCF files to PLINK format with PLINK v1.90 and added the ancestral information from the chimpanzee reference genome (panTro4) as described in Mondal et al., (2019) 212. Mondal, M. ∙ Bertranpetit, J. ∙ Lao, O. Approximate Bayesian computation with deep learning supports a third archaic introgression in Asia and Oceania Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :246 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar . We marked the reference allele as Ancestral and all the alternative alleles as Derived.
An “intergenic region SNP set” was used for this analysis, in an effort to reduce the impact of background selection on demographic inference ( Ewing and Jensen, 2016 82. Ewing, G.B. ∙ Jensen, J.D. The consequences of not accounting for background selection in demographic inference Mol. Ecol. 2016; 25 :135-141 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ; Johri et al., 2020 143. Johri, P. ∙ Charlesworth, B. ∙ Jensen, J.D. Toward an evolutionarily appropriate null model: Jointly inferring demography and purifying selection Genetics. 2020; 215 :173-192 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). All genomic regions containing CpG islands defined in Bock et al. (2007) 23. Bock, C. ∙ Walter, J. ∙ Paulsen, M. ... CpG island mapping by epigenome prediction PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3 :e110 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar were excluded, as well as Ensemble genes and their 20 kb upstream and downstream regions. Genomic regions of at least 10kb and separated by at least 100kb were kept. Within each genomic region we concatenate genomic fragments that were at ≤ 5kb from each other and that were neither in genes nor in CpG islands. Finally, only SNPs covered by at least 10 reads were included in this dataset, resulting in 7,314 regions (comprising 713 Mb) and 5,268,391 SNPs after filtering. This dataset was converted into PED format with PLINK v1.90.
The data were divided into two subsets (“training” and “replication”) using –thin 0.5 and –exclude functions in PLINK v1.90. Each subset accounted for 50% of SNPs from each individual. The “training” subset was used for noise injection in the simulation and training processes, and another “replication” subset represented the observed data in the ABC-DL framework ( Document S1 ).
Classical MDS, also called Principal Coordinate Analysis ( Cox and Cox, 2008 58. Cox, M.A.A. ∙ Cox, T.F. Multidimensional Scaling Handbook of Data Visualization Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2008; 315-347 Crossref Google Scholar ), was used to summarize in two dimensions the relationships among our six ancient samples in the context of 259 previously published ancient, and 638 primarily Eurasian genomes selected from Dataset II ( Table S2 ). For each individual and site, the identity-by-state distances for each pair of individuals were calculated, using a minimum base quality filter of 20. These distances were then used to compute the MDS projection via the cmdscale R function with a custom script ( Document S1 )and to quantify how much variance is explained by each dimension ( Figure 2 ; Document S1 ).
We used the software ADMIXTURE v1.31 ( Alexander et al., 2009 3. Alexander, D.H. ∙ Novembre, J. ∙ Lange, K. Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1655-1664 Crossref Scopus (2882) PubMed Google Scholar ) to infer population structure and sex-biased gene-flow.
To infer population structure, we estimated the average genomic ancestry proportions for a total of 638 modern and 331 ancient Eurasian individuals in Dataset II ( Table S2 ) considering an unsupervised ADMIXTURE model with K ranging from 2 to 6 ( Figure S5 ; Document S1 ). For the unsupervised ADMIXTURE analyses, ten independent replicates were run and the one with the lowest cross-validation (CV) error was selected. The “haploid” option was used as the data included pseudo-haploid data, generated by randomly sampling a single read for each locus. The R package popHelper ( Francis, 2017 97. Francis, R.M. pophelper: an R package and web app to analyse and visualize population structure Mol. Ecol. Resour. 2017; 17 :27-32 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to visualize the estimated admixture proportions for each individual.
To assess sex-biased gene flow, ADMIXTURE was run considering a supervised model with two known sources ( K = 2) for each studied period. When analyzing the EBA Aegeans, we considered Anatolia_N (n = 26) as proxy for the Anatolian Neolithic-like ancestry and merged Iran_N (n = 6) with CHG (n = 2) to represent the Iran_N/CHG -like ancestry. For the MBA Aegeans, Anatolia_N (n = 26) and Steppe_EMBA (n = 27) were used as proxies for the Anatolian Neolithic-like and Steppe-like ancestry respectively. For this analysis, we considered all of the SNPs on the autosomes from Dataset II (165,402 SNPs) and retrieved pseudo-haploid data for 8,133 SNPs on the X chromosome, following the same filtering criteria. As the X chromosome has fewer SNPs (8,133), 100 replicates of ancestry proportion estimates for the autosomes considering 8,133 autosomal SNPs at random were generated. The results are presented in a violin plot corresponding to the distribution (across the 100 replicates) of the autosomal ancestries for each individual ( Figure 5 ). For this analysis, we also used the “haploid” option in ADMIXTURE and pseudo-haploid data as input.
Outgroup f 3 -statistics ( Patterson et al., 2012 240. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (830) PubMed Google Scholar ) were computed to explore the broad genetic affinities between individuals of interest and present-day populations in Dataset I. Specifically, f 3 - statistics of the form f 3 (Yoruba; Y, X) – where X represents one of the present-day populations included in Dataset I and Y represents an ancient or present-day individual of interest – were computed ( Figure S4 ). In this case Y ∈ { Anatolia_N , Greece_N , Mik15 , Pta08 , Kou03 , Anatolia_BA , Kou01 , Minoan_Odigitria , Log04 , Log02 , Minoan_Lasithi , Mycenaean , Greek , Crete, Cypriot }. In Figure S4 , the geographic distribution of the f 3 -statistics computed for each population X is shown.
D -statistics of the form D(Anatolia_N, X; Y, Mota) were computed using Dataset I ( Figure S6 ). Mota is an ancient Ethiopian ( Gallego Llorente et al., 2015 184. Gallego Llorente, M. ∙ Jones, E.R. ∙ Eriksson, A. ... Ancient Ethiopian genome reveals extensive Eurasian admixture in Eastern Africa Science. 2015; 350 :820-822 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For both statistics, standard errors were estimated through a weighted block jackknife approach over approximately 5-Mb blocks. For D -statistics, absolute Z-scores greater than 3.3 (corresponding to a p-value < 0.001) were regarded as statistically significant.
The qpWave/qpAdm ( Haak et al., 2015 125. Haak, W. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe Nature. 2015; 522 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lazaridis et al., 2017 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) framework was used to test for the number of migration waves of ancestry and to estimate the admixture proportion of a Test population based on Dataset I ( Tables 3 , S3 , and S5 ; Document S1 ). Here a set of “Left” populations ( Test population and potential source populations) together with a set of “Right” populations (diverse outgroups) allowed for the testing of the number of waves of ancestry from “Right” to “Left” populations, and for estimation of the admixture proportions of the Test population. Following Lazaridis et al., (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar , two sets of outgroups were used, one using early Neolithic sources and HG (16 populations, ultimate sources). Note that the African individual Mota was used as fixed outgroup.

Likewise, we also defined a second set (proximate sources) by adding younger populations down to the Bronze Age into the “All” set of populations. This may allow for the identification of simpler models underlying the likely complex admixed populations.
All+: All (see above) ∪ Anatolia_ChL, Armenia_ChL, Armenia_EBA, Armenia_MLBA, Europe_LNBA, Europe_MNChL, Iberia_BA, Iran_ChL, Levant_BA, Steppe_EMBA, Steppe_MLBA.
The Left set is chosen to include the Test population (for which the admixture proportions are being modeled) and N populations from the All (or All+) set. The Right set is then All \Left, testing against the maximal set of Right outgroups. To evaluate the relatedness of the BA Greek individuals, we also added our individual samples, as well as the Minoans and Mycenaeans from Lazaridis et al. (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar , and BA Balkan individual samples ( Mathieson et al., 2018 201. Mathieson, I. ∙ Alpaslan-Roodenberg, S. ∙ Posth, C. ... The genomic history of southeastern Europe Nature. 2018; 555 :197-203 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ) as potential sources to the Left set. We further split the BA Balkan samples into EBA and LBA since the amount of reported Steppe admixture is increased in individuals from LBA ( Mathieson et al., 2018 201. Mathieson, I. ∙ Alpaslan-Roodenberg, S. ∙ Posth, C. ... The genomic history of southeastern Europe Nature. 2018; 555 :197-203 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). We infer the rank = N-1 using qpWave and estimate the admixture proportion for the test populations using qpAdm . We show only feasible admixture proportions (in the interval [0,1]) and use a significance threshold of α = 0.05 to reject models.
To make our results comparable to Lazaridis et al. (2017) 177. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans Nature. 2017; 548 :214-218 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar , we used the HO set of 591,642 SNPs for joined analyses of modern and ancient data and the HOIll set of 1,054,671 SNPs (1,054,637 SNPs retained after merging datasets) for analyses considering only ancient individuals (Dataset I).
ROH were computed for the four present-day Greek genomes described in Dataset III, alongside the six BA Aegean genomes ( Kou01 , Kou03 , Log02 , Log04 , Mik15 , Pta08 ). The data were first imputed by extracting all bi-allelic SNPs from 1000 Genomes phase 3 (positions and alleles) ( International HapMap 3 Consortium et al., 2010 140. International HapMap 3 Consortium ∙ Altshuler, D.M. ∙ Gibbs, R.A. ... Integrating common and rare genetic variation in diverse human populations Nature. 2010; 467 :52-58 Crossref Scopus (1818) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, we called genotypes in the form of genotypes likelihoods at all these variant sites in the ten genomes (four present-day Greek genomes and six BA Aegean genomes). For this step, we used bcftools v1.8 constraining the calling model to the positions and alleles extracted at the first step. Third, we imputed genotypes and estimated haplotypes using GLIMPSE v1.0.1 ( Rubinacci et al., 2021 274. Rubinacci, S. ∙ Ribeiro, D.M. ∙ Hofmeister, R. ... Efficient phasing and imputation of low-coverage sequencing data using large reference panels Nature Genetics. 2021; 53 :120-126 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) using 1000 Genomes phase 3 as reference panel within overlapping chunks of ∼2Mb. The imputation outcome takes the form of haplotype calls, which are essentially a phased version of the most likely genotypes. The imputed dataset contained 43,258,118 SNPs.
Runs of homozygosity were called on the imputed haplotype data of the 10 individuals, either using all the imputed variants (total: 43,285,118 SNPs) or a subset of the variants excluding transitions (total: 13,542,104 SNPs). ROH were identified using PLINK 1.9 ( Purcell et al., 2007 257. Purcell, S. ∙ Neale, B. ∙ Todd-Brown, K. ... PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81 :559-575 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16638) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the option—homozyg printing all identified ROH of at least 500 kb (—homozyg-kb 500). The following arguments were kept with default parameters as specified in PLINK 1.9: a minimum of 100 SNPs per ROH (—homozyg-snp 100), a minimum density of one SNP per 50 kb (—homozyg-density 50), merging consecutive ROH with gaps shorter than 1 Mb (—homozyg-gap 1000), scanning window spanning 50 SNPs (—homozyg-window-snp 50), including at most one heterozygous call per window (—homozyg-window-het 1), and at most five missing calls per window (—homozyg-window-het 5). Results are shown in Figure S7 .
ABC is a Bayesian statistical framework that comprises a family of algorithms ( Beaumont et al., 2002 13. Beaumont, M.A. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Balding, D.J. Approximate Bayesian computation in population genetics Genetics. 2002; 162 :2025-2035 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Bertorelle et al., 2010 20. Bertorelle, G. ∙ Benazzo, A. ∙ Mona, S. ABC as a flexible framework to estimate demography over space and time: some cons, many pros Mol. Ecol. 2010; 19 :2609-2625 Crossref Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pritchard et al., 1999 253. Pritchard, J.K. ∙ Seielstad, M.T. ∙ Perez-Lezaun, A. ... Population growth of human Y chromosomes: a study of Y chromosome microsatellites Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16 :1791-1798 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Tavaré et al., 1997 300. Tavaré, S. ∙ Balding, D.J. ∙ Griffiths, R.C. ... Inferring coalescence times from DNA sequence data Genetics. 1997; 145 :505-518 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform model comparison and parameter estimation using simulated data. ABC has a long tradition in population genomics as - especially for complex models - it is generally straightforward to generate data but often difficult to estimate the likelihood analytically ( Hoban et al., 2012 133. Hoban, S. ∙ Bertorelle, G. ∙ Gaggiotti, O.E. Computer simulations: tools for population and evolutionary genetics Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13 :110-122 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, ABC-based demographic inference is conducted by generating simulated data under the prior probabilities of the parameters/demographic models considered in the study; each simulated dataset is then compared with the observed data by means of a set of summary statistics that capture relevant information in the data; the parameters/models used to generate the simulations are accepted as sampled from their posterior distributions if the summary statistics are similar to the ones estimated in the observed data.
For any given dataset, several summary statistics can be defined. Nevertheless, identifying summary statistics that capture all of the information present in the data pertaining to the parameter or model of interest is usually not straightforward. For a given set of summary statistics, several computational methods - such as machine learning ( Beaumont, 2019 12. Beaumont, M.A. Approximate Bayesian Computation Annu. Rev. Stat. Appl. 2019; 6 :379-403 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ) - have been proposed to automatize the choice of informative summary statistics. ABC-DL relies on DL to define the informative summary statistics to be used in ABC ( Wong et al., 2018 347. Wong, W. ∙ Jiang, B. ∙ Wu, T. ... Learning Summary Statistic for Approximate Bayesian Computation via Deep Neural Network Stat. Sin. 2018; 27 :1595-1618 Google Scholar ). The joint site frequency spectrum ( jSFS ) has been previously used as input to the DL for comparing complex demographic models ( Lorente-Galdos et al., 2019 186. Lorente-Galdos, B. ∙ Lao, O. ∙ Serra-Vidal, G. ... Whole-genome sequence analysis of a Pan African set of samples reveals archaic gene flow from an extinct basal population of modern humans into sub-Saharan populations Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :77 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mondal et al., 2019 212. Mondal, M. ∙ Bertranpetit, J. ∙ Lao, O. Approximate Bayesian computation with deep learning supports a third archaic introgression in Asia and Oceania Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :246 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this work, we have extended the ABC-DL framework to account for aDNA specificities by augmenting the simulator to include features typical of aDNA such as high error rates and low coverage prior to calling genotypes.
We used the coalescence-based simulator fastSimcoal2 to generate ∼713 Mbp of sequenced data assuming neutrality, considering a recombination rate over the genome of 1.0e-8 ( Li and Jakobsson, 2012 180. Li, S. ∙ Jakobsson, M. Estimating demographic parameters from large-scale population genomic data using Approximate Bayesian Computation BMC Genet. 2012; 13 :22 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a mutation rate sampled from a Normal distribution with mean 1.61e-8 and standard deviation of 0.13e-8 ( Lipson et al., 2015 183. Lipson, M. ∙ Loh, P.-R. ∙ Sankararaman, S. ... Calibrating the human mutation rate via ancestral recombination density in diploid genomes PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1005550 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since fastSimcoal2 requires times to be specified in generations, each date was initially scaled by the average human generation time (29 years) estimated by Fenner (2005) 88. Fenner, J.N. Cross-cultural estimation of the human generation interval for use in genetics-based population divergence studies Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 2005; 128 :415-423 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar . After this step, the simulated data were first re-sampled to match the observed depth of coverage, genotypes were then recalled on the resulting alleles, noise was introduced to mimic the increased error rate in aDNA, and contamination was simulated assuming that it originated from present-day Greeks ( Document S1 ).
We applied a two-step model comparison approach to define the topology of the underlying demographic model. First, we tested four three-leaf models to establish the topology of the three ancestral populations CHG , EHG and Aegean Neolithic ( Figure 4 A) based on the prior distributions of demographic parameters listed in Table S4 . The tree with highest support was then used as a backbone for more complex 7-leaf models ( Figure 4 B). We compared six 7-leaf plausible models compatible with previous results for Europe_LNBA and with results from this study ( Figure 4 B), based on the prior distributions of demographic parameters listed in Table S4 .
For model comparison, each network was trained with 20,000 simulations per model, setting as output for each simulation the probability of assignment to one of the models. Next, we generated an additional set of 100,000 simulations per model, and used each DL network to predict the probability of assignment to each demographic model. A combined DL prediction was obtained by averaging over the 100 DL predictions. This combined prediction was used as the summary statistic for the ABC analysis. For defining the best summary statistic of a parameter from a demographic model, we trained 10 independent DL networks with 10,000 simulations as the training dataset, and generated a combined DL prediction to be used in the ABC step by averaging over the 10 DL. We used the prediction as a summary statistic in the ABC analysis to generate the posterior distribution of the parameter.
The accuracy of ABC-DL for distinguishing between the proposed models was quantified using simulated genomic data from the different models as observed data, and by inferring the posterior probability of each model with ABC-DL. The contingency table between the model that produced the simulation and the model with the largest posterior probability defines the confusion matrix ( Csilléry et al., 2010 59. Csilléry, K. ∙ Blum, M.G.B. ∙ Gaggiotti, O.E. ... Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) in practice Trends Ecol. Evol. 2010; 25 :410-418 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (622) PubMed Google Scholar ). The diagonal of the confusion matrix quantifies how well the ABC-DL approach properly identifies the model used to generate the data. The confusion matrix for the four three-leaf models suggests that ABC-DL can distinguish the different models, as the P(Real Model|Inferred Model) ranged between 0.66 to 0.96 ( Table S4 ). For the 7-leaf models, the confusion matrix suggests that ABC-DL can distinguish the models as the P(Real Model|Inferred Model) ranged between 0.69 to 0.95 ( Table S4 ).
For each parameter, Spearman’s rank correlation between the values used to simulate the data and the DL prediction was computed to quantify the amount of information that the DL prediction provided. Furthermore, we estimated how well the mean of the posterior recapitulates the true value of each parameter by means of the factor 1.25 statistic, the fraction of times that the estimated mean of the posterior was within the range of 80% to 125% of the simulated value of a parameter (see Table S4 , Document S1 , and Excoffier et al., [2005] 86. Excoffier, L. ∙ Estoup, A. ∙ Cornuet, J.-M. Bayesian analysis of an admixture model with mutations and arbitrarily linked markers Genetics. 2005; 169 :1727-1738 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar for details). When ABC-DL was applied to the observed data, divergence between the shape of the prior and posterior distribution was estimated by means of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) ( Kullback and Leibler, 1951 169. Kullback, S. ∙ Leibler, R.A. On information and sufficiency Ann. Math. Stat. 1951; 22 :79-86 Crossref Google Scholar ). Reduction in the amount of uncertainty of the posterior with regards to the prior was judged by means of the ratio of highest density interval (HDI). For the three-leaf model A1, all of the validation analyses discussed above suggest that it is possible to obtain reliable posterior distributions for the parameters ( Table S4 ; Document S1 ). For the 7-leaf model B4, we observed a high variability in the performance of ABC-DL for estimating the posterior distributions of the parameters ( Table S4 ; Document S1 ), which can be expected given the complexity of the model. Nevertheless, for the estimated time and amounts of CHG -related and Steppe_EMBA -related gene flow reported in the text, we have (i) a Spearman's rank correlation ≥ 0.5 between the DL prediction and the value used in the simulation, (ii) high (≥1.5) ratio factor 1.25 posterior mean/random prior, (iii) large (> 0.5) KL-divergence between posterior and prior, and (iv) strong reduction in HDI (> 2), that is, in the uncertainty of the posterior distribution compared to the prior distribution. These results suggest that the estimations obtained by ABC-DL for these four parameters substantially reduce the amount of our prior uncertainty.
The genotype likelihoods from the mapped reads of our nuclear capture data were calculated using ANGSD v. 0.921 ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 157. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar ). For this, we specified the SAMtools model (-GL 1) and inferred major/minor alleles from the genotype likelihood (-doMajorMinor 1 -doMaf 1). We used a minimum read depth of 20 (-genoMinDepth 20) and trimmed 10 bases of the reads from both ends (-trim 10). Furthermore, we assumed a uniform prior for the genotypes (-doPost 2) and only considered called genotypes with posterior probabilities > 0.95 (-postCutoff 0.95) and base (-minQ 30) and mapping (-minMapQ 30) qualities of 30 in Phred score. Using these data, we extracted genotypes for Kou01 , Log02 and Pta08 for two SNPs on chromosome 2 – rs4988235 and rs182549 – in which the alleles T −13,910 and A −22,018 respectively are informative of lactase persistence. Furthermore, we used the capture data to infer eye-, hair- and skin color for the individuals Kou01 , Log02 and Pta08 using the HIrisPLex-S DNA Phenotyping Webtool ( https://hirisplex.erasmusmc.nl/ ). We compared our dataset with the 41 SNPs published as HIrisPlex-S ( Chaitanya et al., 2018 46. Chaitanya, L. ∙ Breslin, K. ∙ Zuñiga, S. ... The HIrisPlex-S system for eye, hair and skin colour prediction from DNA: Introduction and forensic developmental validation Forensic Sci. Int.

Genet. 2017; 136 :847-863 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found an overlap of 30 SNPs ( Table S1 , “Nuclear capture” tab). Note that HIrisPLex-S is an extension of the previously published HIrisPLex, which contains 24 SNPs for eye and hair color determination ( Walsh et al., 2014 336. Walsh, S. ∙ Chaitanya, L. ∙ Clarisse, L. ... Developmental validation of the HIrisPlex system: DNA-based eye and hair colour prediction for forensic and anthropological usage Forensic Sci. Int. Genet. 2014; 9 :150-161 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that our data cover 23 of those 24 SNPs. The HIrisPLex-S webtool calculates individual prediction probabilities and associated values for the loss of prediction accuracy (AUC loss) depending on the available set of SNPs. The results for Kou01 , Log02 and Pta08 are given in Table S1 . The most supported eye, hair and skin color is the one with the highest prediction probability ( Table S1 ). A discussion about lactose intolerance can be found in Document S1 .
