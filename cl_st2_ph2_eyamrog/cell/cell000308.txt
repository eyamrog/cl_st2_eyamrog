Title: Latent developmental potential to form limb-like skeletal structures in zebrafish


Abstract: Summary

Changes in appendage structure underlie key transitions in vertebrate evolution. Addition of skeletal elements along the proximal-distal axis facilitated critical transformations, including the fin-to-limb transition that permitted generation of diverse modes of locomotion. Here, we identify zebrafish mutants that form supernumerary long bones in their pectoral fins. These new bones integrate into musculature, form joints, and articulate with neighboring elements. This phenotype is caused by activating mutations in previously unrecognized regulators of appendage patterning, vav2 and waslb , that function in a common pathway. This pathway is required for appendage development across vertebrates, and loss of Wasl in mice causes defects similar to those seen in murine Hox mutants. Concordantly, formation of supernumerary bones requires Hox11 function, and mutations in the vav2/wasl pathway drive enhanced expression of hoxa11b , indicating developmental homology with the forearm. Our findings reveal a latent, limb-like pattern ability in fins that is activated by simple genetic perturbation.

Section: Introduction

Vertebrates have evolved diverse appendages that exhibit a wide variety of forms and functions. Tetrapod limbs permit mobility via articulation of multiple endochondral long bones facilitated by specialized synovial joints. Based on this framework, limbs have evolved divergent structures through digit reduction, phalangeal addition, transformation of wrist and ankle bones, alteration in element proportion, and outright limb-loss ( Owen, 1849 60. Owen, R. On the Nature of Limbs: A Discourse Delivered on Friday, February 9, at an Evening Meeting of the Royal Institution of Great Britain J. Van Voorst, 1849 Crossref Google Scholar ). In contrast, the skeletal pattern of the teleost pectoral appendage is almost invariant, showing a consistent arrangement across diverse lineages within this group of ∼30,000 species. Teleost pectoral fins are composed of dermal fin rays supported at their base by a diminutive endoskeleton ( Figure 1 A). This endoskeleton typically consists of four long bones, called proximal radials, arranged side by side along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, followed distally by small nodular distal radials ( Jessen, 1972 36.

(Editors) Mesozoic Fishes 2 – Systematics and Fossil Record Verlag, 1999; 265-334 Google Scholar ). No known teleost species exhibits more than a single long bone along the proximal-distal (PD) axis ( Starks, 1930 77. Starks, E.C. The Primary Shoulder Girdle of the Bony Fishes Stanford University Press, 1930 Google Scholar ). The divergent architectures of teleost fins and tetrapod limbs have been maintained within each clade for over 250 million ( Near et al., 2012 57. Near, T.J. ∙ Eytan, R.I. ∙ Dornburg, A. ...

Hidden morphological diversity among early tetrapods Nature. 2017; 546 :642-645 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ) years, respectively.
Evidence from fossils suggests that, similar to extant ray-finned fishes, the common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods had a series of long bones arranged side by side along the AP axis of the pectoral appendage ( Zhu and Yu, 2009 92. Zhu, M. ∙ Yu, X. Stem sarcopterygians have primitive polybasal fin articulation Biol. Lett. 2009; 5 :372-375 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). The posterior-most element of this series was segmented along the PD axis, creating end-on-end articulation ( Figure 1 A). This structure, called the metapterygium, is not retained in teleost fishes, and is hypothesized to have been elaborated to form limbs through the progressive acquisition and regionalization of elements along the PD axis of the appendicular skeleton in stem and crown group lobe-finned fishes ( Gegenbaur, 1865 24. Gegenbaur, C. Untersuchungen zur vergleichenden Anatomie der Wirbeltiere Wilheim Engelmann, 1865 Google Scholar ; Coates, 1994 12. Coates, M.I. The origin of vertebrate limbs Dev.

Shubin, N. ∙ Tabin, C. ∙ Carroll, S. Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty Nature. 2009; 457 :818-823 Crossref Scopus (601) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 A and S1 ).
Due to their divergent skeletal patterns, identifying homologous structures between fins and limbs with one-to-one correspondence is difficult. However, despite the morphological disparity between fins and limbs, comparative approaches in developmental genetics have revealed shared pathways required for the normal patterning of these appendages. Hox genes in particular are key players that specify and reinforce regional identity in appendages ( Zakany and Duboule, 2007 91. Zakany, J. ∙ Duboule, D. The role of Hox genes during vertebrate limb development Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17 :359-366 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overexpression of hoxd13a in embryonic zebrafish causes increased, but unpatterned, chondrogenic tissue formation in the larval pectoral fin ( Freitas et al., 2012 21. Freitas, R. ∙ Gómez-Marín, C. ∙ Wilson, J.M. ... Hoxd13 contribution to the evolution of vertebrate appendages Dev. Cell. 2012; 23 :1219-1229 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, deletions of posterior group 13 HoxA and HoxD genes result in the loss of distal skeletal elements in mouse limbs (wrist/ankle and hand/foot) and zebrafish fins (dermal fin rays), suggesting that these genes provide a regional address for distal elements in the different appendages ( Nakamura et al., 2016 56. Nakamura, T. ∙ Gehrke, A.R. ∙ Lemberg, J. ... Digits and fin rays share common developmental histories Nature. 2016; 537 :225-228 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). While Hox genes that pattern more proximal limb components have been identified in tetrapods, it is unclear if similar mechanisms instruct the patterning of non-distal components of the fin.
Here, through unbiased forward genetic screens in the zebrafish focusing on adult morphology ( Haffter et al., 1996 29. Haffter, P. ∙ Odenthal, J. ∙ Mullins, M.C. ... Mutations affecting pigmentation and shape of the adult zebrafish Dev. Genes Evol. 1996; 206 :260-276 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ; Henke et al., 2017 33. Henke, K. ∙ Daane, J.M. ∙ Hawkins, M.B. ... Genetic Screen for Postembryonic Development in the Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ): Dominant Mutations Affecting Adult Form Genetics. 2017; 207 :609-623 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identify mutants that break the long-standing teleost fin pattern by developing new skeletal elements along the PD axis of the pectoral fin in a limb-like manner. These novel structures are fully differentiated long bones that integrate into the fin musculature and articulate with the fin skeleton. Similar to limb long bones, these elements arise from the segmentation of a common precursor and form joints at the site of segmentation. Mapping of the underlying mutations reveals modulation of vav2 and waslb signaling as causing the aberrant phenotypes. We show through epistasis analysis that these genes function together in a common pathway not previously associated with limb development or embryonic patterning. Conditional knockout of Wasl in the mouse demonstrates that this pathway is required for normal appendage patterning in tetrapods, and its absence results in a range of skeletal phenotypes that resemble those seen in Hox and Gdf mouse mutants. We also find that wasl genes affect the formation of F-actin puncta that co-localize with Hox13-positive migratory cells in the developing fin. Through generation of triple loss-of-function hox11 zebrafish mutants by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we demonstrate that waslb requires hox11 function to form supernumerary elements, and more broadly interacts with hox genes to pattern the PD fin axis. We further show that vav2 and waslb gain-of-function mutations cause increased expression of hoxa11b expression in the developing fin. Our results demonstrate that zebrafish retain the capacity to form structures with an intermediate regional address specified by hox11 paralogs, similar to the limb zeugopod. This latent capacity is activated by simple genetic changes, revealing a novel appendage-patterning pathway that may have played unrecognized roles in the fin-to-limb transition and skeletal development at large.

Section: Results

Wild-type zebrafish pectoral fins are representative of the ancestral teleost configuration, with four proximal radials arranged side-by-side followed by small nodular distal radials ( Figure 1 B). All four proximal radials are in direct contact with the shoulder early in development, but the two posterior radials shift distally in adulthood ( Grandel and Schulte-Merker, 1998 27. Grandel, H. ∙ Schulte-Merker, S. The development of the paired fins in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) Mech. Dev. 1998; 79 :99-120 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify genes affecting the form and pattern of the adult skeleton in zebrafish, we conducted a forward mutagenesis screen focused on dominant mutations ( Henke et al., 2017 33. Henke, K. ∙ Daane, J.M. ∙ Hawkins, M.B. ... Genetic Screen for Postembryonic Development in the Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ): Dominant Mutations Affecting Adult Form Genetics. 2017; 207 :609-623 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our screen, we isolated a mutant that breaks from the teleost ground plan by forming supernumerary long bones along the PD axis of the pectoral fin endoskeleton ( Figure 1 C). We call these new bones ‘intermediate radials.’ They are found between the posterior proximal radials and distal radials, and they do not articulate directly with the shoulder. The overall pattern and size of the fin rays are not dramatically altered. We named this mutant rephaim ( reph ). The mutant phenotype exhibits varied expressivity and dose sensitivity, as homozygous fish are highly dysmorphic ( Figure S2 ). Due to the severity of the homozygous condition, we have focused our analysis on heterozygous reph mutants ( reph /+).
Using whole-exome sequencing, we mapped the reph mutation to chromosome 4 ( Figure S3 ) ( Bowen et al., 2012 8. Bowen, M.E. ∙ Henke, K. ∙ Siegfried, K.R. ... Efficient mapping and cloning of mutations in zebrafish by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing Genetics. 2012; 190 :1017-1024 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of sequence data from the linked interval identified a missense mutation in the gene wiskott-aldrich syndrome-like b ( waslb ), changing a serine to a proline at amino acid position 265 ( Figure 1 D). Waslb is a member of the WAS protein family of actin cytoskeleton signaling regulators, which interact with Cdc42 and Arp2/3 to nucleate filamentous actin (F-actin) formation, and have roles in cell migration, cell signaling, and cell polarity ( Snapper and Rosen, 1999 73. Snapper, S.B. ∙ Rosen, F.S. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP): roles in signaling and cytoskeletal organization Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17 :905-929 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, nuclear-localized Wasl is required for the transcription of select genes through its interaction with nuclear actin, transcription factors, and RNA polymerase ( Wu et al., 2006 88. Wu, X. ∙ Yoo, Y. ∙ Okuhama, N.N. ... Regulation of RNA-polymerase-II-dependent transcription by N-WASP and its nuclear-binding partners Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 :756-763 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ferrai et al., 2009 20. Ferrai, C. ∙ Naum-Onganía, G. ∙ Longobardi, E. ... Induction of HoxB transcription by retinoic acid requires actin polymerization Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20 :3543-3551 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
To verify that the waslb mutation causes the reph phenotype, as well as to determine the genetic nature of the dominant reph allele, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate targeted frameshift mutations in wild-type waslb as well as in cis to the candidate reph S265P mutation, and assessed their effect on fin skeleton patterning ( Figures 1 D and S3 ). Loss-of-function of wild-type waslb does not have any obvious effect on fin patterning ( Figures S3 and S4) . However, frameshift mutations generated upstream in cis to the reph missense mutation lead to reversion of the mutant phenotype, restoring the wild-type radial pattern. Small, in-frame deletions in cis to the mutation failed to rescue the wild-type phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate that the identified S265P mutation in waslb causes the reph phenotype, likely through a gain-of-function effect. The altered residue in reph is conserved across vertebrates and is positioned in a hinge region that is thought to regulate auto-inhibition and localization of the protein ( Figure S3 ) ( Suetsugu and Takenawa, 2003 78. Suetsugu, S. ∙ Takenawa, T. Translocation of N-WASP by nuclear localization and export signals into the nucleus modulates expression of HSP90 J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :42515-42523 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this, introduction of the reph mutation into fluorescently tagged Wasl protein led to a marked reduction in nuclear localization of the fusion protein in cell culture ( Figure S3 ). Similar shifts in cellular localization have been observed in Wasl constructs bearing phosphomimetic substitutions at a tyrosine residue adjacent to the residue mutated in reph ( Suetsugu and Takenawa, 2003 78. Suetsugu, S. ∙ Takenawa, T. Translocation of N-WASP by nuclear localization and export signals into the nucleus modulates expression of HSP90 J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :42515-42523 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). This reduction in nuclear localization points toward a possible increase in cytoplasmic waslb function in the reph mutant.
As waslb is a novel factor in appendage development, we sought to identify additional loci that affect fin endoskeletal patterning in a similar manner. Although large dominant screens are not common in zebrafish, mutants having viable dominant phenotypes have been identified as a by-product of recessive genetic screens. We searched published screens and identified a mutant called wanda ( wan ) with an outward phenotype similar to reph ( Figure S2 ) ( Haffter et al., 1996 29. Haffter, P. ∙ Odenthal, J. ∙ Mullins, M.C. ... Mutations affecting pigmentation and shape of the adult zebrafish Dev. Genes Evol. 1996; 206 :260-276 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ; van Eeden et al., 1996 85. van Eeden, F.J. ∙ Granato, M. ∙ Schach, U. ... Genetic analysis of fin formation in the zebrafish, Danio rerio Development. 1996; 123 :255-262 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We obtained the wan mutant and found that it exhibited intermediate radials in a pattern similar to reph ( Figure 1 E), a phenotype that had not been previously reported. Similar to reph , wan shows variable phenotypic expressivity and dose sensitivity ( Figure S2 ).
Unexpectedly, test crosses revealed wan not to be allelic with reph but a mutation in an unlinked locus. We mapped wan and identified a missense mutation in a conserved residue of the vav2 gene on chromosome 21 (S67A; Figures 1 D and S3 ). The Vav family of protooncogenes consists of proteins that function as guanosine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases, and have roles in signal transduction, cytoskeletal regulation, cell motility, and receptor endocytosis ( Bustelo, 2001 9. Bustelo, X.R. Vav proteins, adaptors and cell signaling Oncogene. 2001; 20 :6372-6381 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar , 2014 10. Bustelo, X.R. Vav family exchange factors: an integrated regulatory and functional view Small GTPases. 2014; 5 :9 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hornstein et al., 2004 35. Hornstein, I. ∙ Alcover, A. ∙ Katzav, S. Vav proteins, masters of the world of cytoskeleton organization Cell. Signal. 2004; 16 :1-11 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). We created vav2 loss-of-function mutations using CRISPR-Cas9 and found that vav2 homozygous null zebrafish are viable and have no skeletal phenotypes ( Figures S3 and S4 ), consistent with the phenotype reported for the Vav2 knockout mouse ( Fujikawa et al., 2003 23. Fujikawa, K. ∙ Miletic, A.V. ∙ Alt, F.W. ... Vav1/2/3-null mice define an essential role for Vav family proteins in lymphocyte development and activation but a differential requirement in MAPK signaling in T and B cells J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198 :1595-1608 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, truncating mutations made in cis upstream of the S67A wan mutation cause reversion of the wan skeletal phenotype ( Figures 1 D and S3 ). Thus, similar to reph , wan causes fin patterning changes through a gain-of-function mutation.
Vav2 activates the small G-protein Cdc42 ( Abe et al., 2000 1. Abe, K. ∙ Rossman, K.L. ∙ Liu, B. ... Vav2 is an activator of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :10141-10149 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Cdc42 in turn regulates the activity of Wasl ( Carlier et al., 1999 11. Carlier, M.F. ∙ Ducruix, A. ∙ Pantaloni, D. Signalling to actin: the Cdc42-N-WASP-Arp2/3 connection Chem. Biol. 1999; 6 :R235-R240 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, it is likely that the similar phenotypes observed in reph and wan mutants are due to their effect on a common signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we crossed waslb loss-of-function alleles to the wan/vav2 mutant and found that waslb function is required for the expression of the wan phenotype ( Figures 1 E and S4 ). Thus, waslb is epistatic to vav2 , and these genes act together in a common pathway to pattern the fin endoskeleton ( Figure 1 F). Loss of the other zebrafish wasl paralog, wasla , does not affect the fin skeleton or impact the reph and wan phenotypes, indicating that waslb is the critical paralog in fin patterning ( Figure S4 ). Whole mount in situ hybridization reveals that both genes are expressed in fins during early patterning stages ( Figure 1 G), suggesting that these genes might act in the developing fin mesenchyme. Interestingly, neither waslb nor vav2 have previously been associated with fin or limb development, skeletogenesis, or embryonic patterning at large.
In the fin-to-limb transition, there was a reduction of the dermal fin rays concomitant with the elaboration of the endoskeleton, until fin rays were ultimately lost in crown tetrapods ( Coates, 1994 12. Coates, M.I. The origin of vertebrate limbs Dev. Suppl. 1994; 169-180 PubMed Google Scholar ; Shubin et al., 2006 69. Shubin, N.H. ∙ Daeschler, E.B. ∙ Jenkins, Jr., F.A. The pectoral fin of Tiktaalik roseae and the origin of the tetrapod limb Nature. 2006; 440 :764-771 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shubin et al., 2009 70. Shubin, N. ∙ Tabin, C. ∙ Carroll, S. Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty Nature. 2009; 457 :818-823 Crossref Scopus (601) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fin rays arise from the larval fin fold ( Grandel and Schulte-Merker, 1998 27. Grandel, H. ∙ Schulte-Merker, S. The development of the paired fins in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) Mech. Dev. 1998; 79 :99-120 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mechanistic hypotheses regarding the fin-to-limb transition posit a developmental trade-off between the fin endoskeleton and the fin fold, such that early formation of the fin fold in teleosts results in their diminutive endoskeleton ( Thorogood, 1991 81. Thorogood, P. The Development of the Teleost Fin and Implications for Our Understanding of Tetrapod Limb Hinchliffe, J.R. ∙ Summerbell, D. (Editors) Developmental Patterning of the Vertebrate Limb, H.J.M Springer, 1991 Crossref Google Scholar ). Previous studies have tested if reduction of the fin fold can result in limb-like characteristics in developing zebrafish fins. Experimental extirpation of the fin fold during early development leads to an enlargement of the endoskeletal disc in larval zebrafish, suggesting that the fin fold represses disc growth ( Yano et al., 2012 89. Yano, T. ∙ Abe, G. ∙ Yokoyama, H. ... Mechanism of pectoral fin outgrowth in zebrafish development Development. 2012; 139 :2916-2925 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, similar to the effect of reducing hox13 paralog function ( Nakamura et al., 2016 56. Nakamura, T. ∙ Gehrke, A.R. ∙ Lemberg, J. ... Digits and fin rays share common developmental histories Nature. 2016; 537 :225-228 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), subsequent elaboration of the adult fin endoskeleton is generally negligible, or has not been assessed, in the different manipulations. To determine if changes in fin fold dynamics underlie intermediate radial development, we examined fin fold formation in reph/+ mutants. Immunolabeling with an anti-collagen antibody that detects actinotrichia ( Lalonde and Akimenko, 2018 45. Lalonde, R.L. ∙ Akimenko, M.A. Effects of fin fold mesenchyme ablation on fin development in zebrafish PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0192500 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ), the fibers that support the larval fin fold, revealed no qualitative differences between wild-type and reph /+ pectoral fins at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) ( Figure 2 A). We also find no difference in endoskeletal disc size or fin fold size at 7 dpf ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The absence of changes in the endoskeletal disc and fin fold is consistent with a lack of patterning defects in 3-week-old mutant fins ( Figure 2 C). Thus, contrary to previous hypotheses, trade-offs between fin fold and endoskeletal disc development are not required for PD elaboration of the endoskeleton in reph /+ mutants.
In teleost fishes, the fin endoskeleton first forms as a continuous endoskeletal disc of cartilage that is subsequently subdivided into the four proximal radial anlagen by localized involution and trans-differentiation, followed by perichondral ossification ( Figure 2 C) ( Grandel and Schulte-Merker, 1998 27. Grandel, H. ∙ Schulte-Merker, S. The development of the paired fins in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) Mech. Dev. 1998; 79 :99-120 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dewit et al., 2011 17. Dewit, J. ∙ Witten, P.E. ∙ Huysseune, A. The mechanism of cartilage subdivision in the reorganization of the zebrafish pectoral fin endoskeleton J. Exp. Zoolog. B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2011; 316 :584-597 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). This process occurs normally in reph /+ mutants ( Figure 2 C). It is only after initial patterning and differentiation that differences are seen between wild-type and mutant fish endoskeletons, when reph /+ mutants show an elongation of the more posterior cartilage condensations compared to wild-type fish ( Figures 2 C–2E). The extended condensations in reph /+ mutants form multiple sites of mineralization, with the nascent intermediate radial forming a distinct bone collar, while wild-type siblings have a single continuous zone of mineralization beginning proximally and growing distally ( Figures 2 C and 2D). The elongated condensation in mutants is subsequently segmented, resolving into two distinct bones separated by a joint space. This mode of ossification and cartilage segmentation in reph /+ mutants has not been reported in the pectoral fins of any other teleost, and is similar to tetrapod limb development, where an initially continuous condensation is segmented along the PD axis to produce independent elements separated by a joint ( Hall, 2015 31. Hall, B. Bones and cartilage: Developmental and evolutionary skeletal biology Elsevier, 2015 Google Scholar ).
To investigate the mechanisms underlying segmentation and joint formation in reph /+ mutants, we examined pre-segmentation radials using confocal optical sections. We found that chondrocytes within each condensation vary in size in different regions of the element. Both wild-type and reph /+ condensations possess a distal growth zone consisting of small, flat chondrocytes, subtended by large hypertrophic chondrocytes ( Figure 2 D). We do not detect differences in average cell size in the hypertrophic regions of mutant and wild-type radials ( Figure 2 F). However, reph /+ mutants have a distinct region of condensed cells that intercedes the hypertrophic chondrocytes. These regions are found between the bone collars and mark the point where segmentation will occur. We have termed this the interzone region, as it resembles the limb region of the same name that also specifies nascent joints ( Khan et al., 2007 38. Khan, I.M. ∙ Redman, S.N. ∙ Williams, R. ... The development of synovial joints Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2007; 79 :1-36 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next asked how these interzones are positioned along the length of mutant radial elements and measured wild-type 4 th proximal radials (PR4) and reph /+ pre-segmentation 4 th radials at 4 weeks post fertilization. As expected, reph /+ elements are significantly longer on average than wild type elements ( Figure 2 E). However, the length of the nascent PR4 in reph /+ animals is significantly shorter than the element in wild-type, by as much as 50%. By plotting interzone position along the radial as a proportion of overall length, we find that interzones occur at various relative positions ( Figure 2 G). In two cases, radial elements in reph /+ had additional interzones distal to the first; however, these elements were not the longest in our sampling. Altogether, these results suggest that the decision to segment is not a simple response to total element size, and the interzone is not placed at a specific position along the radial.
Histological analysis of adult fins reveals that, while proximal radials possess epiphyses only at their distal ends, reph intermediate radials form both proximal and distal epiphyses ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Both distal and proximal epiphyses exhibit normal differentiation of the cartilage in reph /+ mutants. Like the epiphyses of wild-type proximal radials and the long bones of tetrapod limbs, the newly formed epiphyses of intermediate radials express bone patterning genes such as indian hedgehog a ( ihha ; Figure 3 C) ( Kronenberg, 2003 41. Kronenberg, H.M. Developmental regulation of the growth plate Nature. 2003; 423 :332-336 Crossref Scopus (2315) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intermediate radials also show evidence of vascular invasion ( Figure 3 D), suggesting the activation of endochondral ossification programs in reph /+ mutants similar to those found in tetrapod long bones and the bones of larger fishes ( Haines, 1942 30. Haines, R.W. The evolution of epiphyses and of endochondral bone Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1942; 17 :267-292 Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar ). In limbs, synovial joints are formed between long bone elements ( Hall, 2015 31. Hall, B. Bones and cartilage: Developmental and evolutionary skeletal biology Elsevier, 2015 Google Scholar ). Similarly, in reph /+ mutants, proximal and intermediate radials form a distinct joint pocket between them with specialized differentiation of mesenchyme shaping the interface ( Figure 3 E). We find that the terminal joint marker prg4b ( Rhee et al., 2005 66. Rhee, D.K. ∙ Marcelino, J. ∙ Baker, M. ... The secreted glycoprotein lubricin protects cartilage surfaces and inhibits synovial cell overgrowth J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115 :622-631 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ; Askary et al., 2016 4. Askary, A. ∙ Smeeton, J. ∙ Paul, S. ... Ancient origin of lubricated joints in bony vertebrates eLife. 2016; 5 :e16415 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) is expressed in the superficial chondrocytes of epiphyses, as well as in cells lining the joint space ( Figure 3 F). These findings suggest that the joint differentiation programs found in limbs are also activated in the reph intermediate radials.
In limbs, muscles originate from the shoulder as well as the limb bones and insert on more distal positions along the appendage ( Figure 3 H). Zebrafish, in contrast, have seven muscles that originate on elements of the shoulder girdle and insert directly on the dermal fin rays, bypassing the fin long bones entirely ( Diogo et al., 2018 18. Diogo, R. ∙ Ziermann, J. ∙ Molnar, J. ... Muscles of Chordates: Development, Homologies, and Evolution CRC Press, 2018 Crossref Google Scholar ). This configuration of the pectoral fin musculature is representative of most teleost fishes, and only in certain derived lineages does a muscle insert on pectoral fin radial bones ( Winterbottom, 1973 86. Winterbottom, R. Descriptive synonymy of the striated muscles of the Teleostei Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1973; 125 :225-317 Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, reph /+ intermediate radials have insertion points from muscles originating from the shoulder ( Figure 3 B). We also find muscle fibers that originate on the intermediate radial and insert on the distal dermal fin rays ( Figure 3 G). Thus, not only does the reph mutation reveal a capacity to make new, fully differentiated and patterned long bones, but these elements are morphologically integrated to form limb-like joints and muscle connections not seen in the fins of other teleosts.
Neither wasl nor vav2 have been previously implicated in the regulation of developmental patterning. Germline deletions of Wasl in mice are embryonically lethal ( Lommel et al., 2001 48. Lommel, S. ∙ Benesch, S. ∙ Rottner, K. ... Actin pedestal formation by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and intracellular motility of Shigella flexneri are abolished in N-WASP-defective cells EMBO Rep. 2001; 2 :850-857 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ; Snapper et al., 2001 74. Snapper, S.B. ∙ Takeshima, F. ∙ Antón, I. ... N-WASP deficiency reveals distinct pathways for cell surface projections and microbial actin-based motility Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3 :897-904 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, zebrafish wasla ; waslb double knockouts are lethal, with none surviving past 7 dpf. These compound zebrafish mutants show a reduced pectoral fin fold and, notably, fail to form actinotrichia ( Figure S4 ). To assess if the patterning roles of vav2 / waslb signaling are zebrafish specific, or if they are conserved across bony fishes, we asked if Wasl is required for normal tetrapod limb development. We generated mice with conditional loss of Wasl function in developing limb progenitors by crossing driver lines that express Cre in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) of the limb into a floxed Wasl L2L background ( Cotta-de-Almeida et al., 2007 13. Cotta-de-Almeida, V. ∙ Westerberg, L. ∙ Maillard, M.H. ... Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and N-WASP are critical for T cell development Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :15424-15429 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Wasl L2L/+ and Wasl L2L/L2L animals lacking Cre drivers are phenotypically wild type, as are Wasl L2L/+ heterozygotes carrying Cre in each line. However, Wasl L2L/L2L mice carrying either the Hoxb6-Cre ( Hoxb6 cKO; Lowe et al., 2000 49. Lowe, L.A. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Kuehn, M.R. HoxB6-Cre transgenic mice express Cre recombinase in extra-embryonic mesoderm, in lateral plate and limb mesoderm and at the midbrain/hindbrain junction Genesis. 2000; 26 :118-120 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) or the Prrx1-Cre ( Prrx1 cKO; Logan et al., 2002 47. Logan, M. ∙ Martin, J.F. ∙ Nagy, A. ... Expression of Cre Recombinase in the developing mouse limb bud driven by a Prxl enhancer Genesis. 2002; 33 :77-80 Crossref Scopus (773) PubMed Google Scholar ) driver exhibit dramatic defects in skeletal patterning. Due to differences between the Cre drivers, the Hoxb6-Cre driver resulted in similar but more mild fore limb phenotypes compared to Prrx1 cKO mice, but more severe hindlimb defects. Long bones in Prrx1 and Hoxb6 cKO mouse limbs are shorter and wider than those of wild-type siblings ( Figures 4 A and 4E). The wrist bones and anklebones of cKO animals exhibit various patterns of fusions between elements ( Figure 4 B and 4F). Intriguingly, the fifth digit of the hand is often missing a phalanx in cKO mice ( Figure 4 C), indicating a conserved role for Wasl in joint formation and appendage patterning in fins and limbs. The pubis and ischium exhibit ectopic fusion, and the tibia and fibula fail to fuse in cKO animals ( Table S1 ). In addition to the appendages, Prrx1 cKO and Hoxb6 cKO mice also have sternum defects where adjacent sternebrae fail to form joints and instead, fuse together ( Figure 4 D). The phenotypes observed in Prrx1 and Hoxb6 cKO mice are reminiscent of those seen in mouse lines with mutations in other patterning genes. For example, HoxA11 mutants fail to fuse the tibia and fibula ( Small and Potter, 1993 71. Small, K.M. ∙ Potter, S.S. Homeotic transformations and limb defects in Hox A11 mutant mice Genes Dev. 1993; 7 :2318-2328 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ), HoxD11 mutants exhibit fusions of the anklebones and reduction of the digit V intermediate phalanx ( Davis and Capecchi, 1994 14. Davis, A.P. ∙ Capecchi, M.R. Axial homeosis and appendicular skeleton defects in mice with a targeted disruption of hoxd-11 Development. 1994; 120 :2187-2198 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and carpal fusions occur in either mutant. Wasl cKO and Gdf6 mutant mice exhibit similar patterns of wrist and ankle fusions ( Settle et al., 2003 68. Settle, Jr., S.H. ∙ Rountree, R.B. ∙ Sinha, A. ... Multiple joint and skeletal patterning defects caused by single and double mutations in the mouse Gdf6 and Gdf5 genes Dev. Biol. 2003; 254 :116-130 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ), while Gdf5 dominant-negative mutants have a similar loss of intermediate phalanges ( Masuya et al., 2007 53. Masuya, H. ∙ Nishida, K. ∙ Furuichi, T. ... A novel dominant-negative mutation in Gdf5 generated by ENU mutagenesis impairs joint formation and causes osteoarthritis in mice Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16 :2366-2375 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, sternebrae fusions are seen in split HoxD cluster inversion mutants ( Tschopp et al., 2009 82. Tschopp, P. ∙ Tarchini, B. ∙ Spitz, F. ... Uncoupling time and space in the collinear regulation of Hox genes PLoS Genet. 2009; 5 :e1000398 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). These similarities suggest that the effects of wasl / vav2 signaling on skeletal development might be mediated through known limb patterning pathways such as the Hox and Gdf genes.
Given the known role of Wasl in F-actin nucleation, we asked if F-actin formation in zebrafish wasl mutants is modified in ways that could affect skeletal pattern. Using fluorescent phalloidin conjugates, we found that F-actin polymers form discrete puncta throughout the early pectoral fin fold ( Figure 5 ). These puncta first appear around 56 hpf and persist until at least 14 dpf. At 3 dpf, F-actin puncta are found throughout the fin fold of wild-type pectoral fins. While heterozygous reph animals showed no obvious differences in F-actin distribution at this age, homozygous mutants exhibit large F-actin aggregates in a dysmorphic fin fold ( Figure 5 A). In contrast, wasla ; waslb double mutants show reduction of F-actin puncta formation ( Figure 5 A). Thus, wasl function is positively correlated with F-actin puncta formation in the fin.
F-actin puncta are associated with the formation of cellular contacts with extracellular matrix and/or adjacent cells ( Panza et al., 2015 61. Panza, P. ∙ Maier, J. ∙ Schmees, C. ... Live imaging of endogenous protein dynamics in zebrafish using chromobodies Development. 2015; 142 :1879-1884 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). The distribution of fin puncta was suggestive of an association between F-actin and the Hox13-positive migratory fin fold cells (MFFCs). MFFCs express hox13 genes and are thought to arise from the distal endoskeletal disc region to pattern the distal fin rays ( Nakamura et al., 2016 56. Nakamura, T. ∙ Gehrke, A.R. ∙ Lemberg, J. ... Digits and fin rays share common developmental histories Nature. 2016; 537 :225-228 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lalonde and Akimenko, 2018 45. Lalonde, R.L. ∙ Akimenko, M.A. Effects of fin fold mesenchyme ablation on fin development in zebrafish PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0192500 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Tg(2PΔepi:eGFP) and Tg(mInta-11-β-globin:mCherry) transgenes provide a readout for hoxa13a and hoxd13a expression and label MFFCs ( Lalonde et al., 2016 46. Lalonde, R.L. ∙ Moses, D. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Differential actinodin1 regulation in zebrafish and mouse appendages Dev. Biol. 2016; 417 :91-103 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed phalloidin labeling in the Tg(mInta-11-β-globin:mCherry) line and found that F-actin puncta colocalize with the extensions and processes of Hox13-positive MFFCs ( Figures 5 B and 5C). These processes project from the cell body toward the distal fin fold in arcs that are similar to those of the actinotrichia ( Figure 5 D). Using immunolabeling of collagen to visualize actinotrichia fibers ( Lalonde and Akimenko, 2018 45. Lalonde, R.L. ∙ Akimenko, M.A. Effects of fin fold mesenchyme ablation on fin development in zebrafish PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0192500 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ) along with phalloidin labeling in the Tg(2PΔepi:eGFP) line, we find that these F-actin puncta colocalize at areas in which actinotrichia and extensions of the Hox13-positive MFFCs overlap ( Figure 5 E). Recent work by Kuroda et al. (2020) 42. Kuroda, J. ∙ Itabashi, T. ∙ Iwane, A.H. ... The Physical Role of Mesenchymal Cells Driven by the Actin Cytoskeleton Is Essential for the Orientation of Collagen Fibrils in Zebrafish Fins Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2020; 8 :580520 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar detail the necessity of actin-rich pseudopodial contacts of caudal fin mesenchymal cells in orienting and stabilizing the actinotrichia. Nakamura et al. (2016) report that impaired migration in hox13 null mutants results in the reduction of the fin fold and expansion of the distal radial progenitors. Taken together, the association between Wasl-dependent F-actin puncta, the actinotrichia, and MFFCs suggest that reph may mediate the migratory behavior of Hox-positive cells in the fin.
Limbs have a tripartite bauplan that has been canalized through their evolutionary history ( Figure 1 A), consisting of one long bone (humerus) in the upper arm (the stylopod), two side-by-side long bones (radius and ulna) in the forearm (the zeugopod), and many nodular and long bones in the wrist and hand (the autopod). These regions express different combinations of Hox genes that are required for growth and patterning of the skeleton ( Haack and Gruss, 1993 28. Haack, H. ∙ Gruss, P.

Zakany, J. ∙ Duboule, D. The role of Hox genes during vertebrate limb development Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17 :359-366 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, loss of the A and D members of Hox paralogy group 13 results in the failure to form an autopod ( Fromental-Ramain et al., 1996 22. Fromental-Ramain, C. ∙ Warot, X. ∙ Messadecq, N. ... Hoxa-13 and Hoxd-13 play a crucial role in the patterning of the limb autopod Development. 1996; 122 :2997-3011 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), while removal of the A and D members of group 11 causes dramatic reduction of the radius and ulna as these elements fail to develop as long bones ( Davis et al., 1995 15. Davis, A.P. ∙ Witte, D.P. ∙ Hsieh-Li, H.M. ...

Multiple roles of Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 in the formation of the mammalian forelimb zeugopod Development. 2004; 131 :299-309 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, it was discovered that the A and D members of Hox cognate group 13 are also required for the formation of the bony rays of zebrafish fins, indicating deep homology between the distal regions of both fins and limbs and the conservation of Hox code function across bony fishes ( Nakamura et al., 2016 56. Nakamura, T. ∙ Gehrke, A.R. ∙ Lemberg, J. ... Digits and fin rays share common developmental histories Nature. 2016; 537 :225-228 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We asked if the intermediate radials seen in reph mutants have a specific regional identity delineated by hox gene regulation. Based on the position of intermediate radials along the PD axis, we hypothesized that hox11 paralogs may potentiate the reph phenotype as these genes act to modulate zeugopodial elements in limbs. We created null alleles of the hoxa11a , hoxa11b, and hoxd11a genes and examined how loss of these factors affects the expression of the reph phenotype. Homozygous null mutants for all three hox11 paralogs are viable and fertile, singularly and in combination, and do not show obvious phenotypes in the formation of the fin skeleton ( Figures 6 C and S5 D). However, deletion of these hox11 paralogs in reph /+ mutants resulted in the loss of intermediate radials, reverting the reph /+ pectoral skeleton to the wild-type pattern ( Figures 6 D and S7 A).
To further understand how waslb influences hoxa11 function, we generated a reporter line that expresses tdTomato under the endogenous regulation of the hoxa11b locus ( hoxa11b Tg(hsp70:tdTomato) ( hoxa11b:tdTom ) ( Figure S6 ). Expression of tdTomato in this line recapitulates previously published hoxa11b expression patterns known from whole mount in situ hybridization both in the fins and primary body axis ( Sordino et al., 1996 76. Sordino, P. ∙ Duboule, D. ∙ Kondo, T. Zebrafish Hoxa and Evx-2 genes: cloning, developmental expression and implications for the functional evolution of posterior Hox genes Mech.

Nakamura, T. ∙ Gehrke, A.R. ∙ Lemberg, J. ... Digits and fin rays share common developmental histories Nature. 2016; 537 :225-228 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirm that hoxa11b is co-expressed in the same fin fold cell population labeled by hox13 reporters ( Figure S6 ), and is also expressed in the endoskeletal disc. At 3 dpf, we observed no obvious difference in expression domains or intensity between wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous reph mutant siblings ( Figure 6 G). However, at 6 dpf we observed elevated expression of the hoxa11b reporter in the endoskeletal disc as well as the MFFCs in the reph mutants ( Figure 6 H). This trend continues through at least 9 dpf, where elevated levels of hoxa11b reporter expression are observed in the distal endoskeletal disc and fin fold cells of mutant fins. The same pattern of elevated expression was also observed in wan mutants ( Figure S7 C). These results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations in waslb and vav2 increase hoxa11b expression levels in developing fins, which correlates with the formation of supernumerary radials, and that function of hoxa11 is necessary for the formation of these novel structures. Our finding that reph and wan drive increased hoxa11b expression in the early fin suggests that these mutations cause differences in patterning that are carried through to form the adult phenotype. However, as Hoxa11 has been shown to be required for growth and homeostasis of the zeugopod across ontogeny ( Swinehart et al., 2013 79. Swinehart, I.T. ∙ Schlientz, A.J. ∙ Quintanilla, C.A. ...

Commun. 2019; 10 :3168 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), reph and wan may also regulate late development of the fin radials to affect aspects of the phenotype.
Next, we asked if hox gene interactions characteristic of limb development are also present in the forming fin. In addition to regional specificity, Hox genes exhibit characteristic genetic interactions in the developing appendages. The Hox13 group genes can repress the activity of more proximal Hox genes in a process termed posterior prevalence ( Duboule, 1991 19. Duboule, D. Patterning in the vertebrate limb Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1 :211-216 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). In limbs, Hoxa13 suppresses Hoxa11 activity, and these genes form mutually exclusive expression domains at the zeugopod/autopod boundary ( Kherdjemil et al., 2016 39. Kherdjemil, Y. ∙ Lalonde, R.L. ∙ Sheth, R. ... Evolution of Hoxa11 regulation in vertebrates is linked to the pentadactyl state Nature. 2016; 539 :89-92 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the pectoral fins of teleosts and other ray-finned fishes do not exhibit comparable regionalized hox expression patterns, as hoxa11 and hoxa13 paralogs are expressed in overlapping domains throughout the disc and fin fold ( Sordino et al., 1995 75. Sordino, P. ∙ van der Hoeven, F. ∙ Duboule, D. Hox gene expression in teleost fins and the origin of vertebrate digits Nature. 1995; 375 :678-681 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ; Metscher et al., 2005 54.

Fin-fold development in paddlefish and catshark and implications for the evolution of the autopod Proc. Biol. Sci. 2017; 284 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the nature of the interaction between these paralogs is unknown. Shockingly, we found that deletion of the three hox13 paralogs of the A and D clusters enhances the reph/+ phenotype and causes the development of even more additional supernumerary long bones along the proximal-distal axis ( Figures 6 F and S7 A). Given that reph and wan increase hoxa11b expression, we interpret these results as a consequence of de-repression of hoxa11 paralogs and suggest that, similar to limbs, hoxa13 paralogs negatively regulate hoxa11b in the fin. This negative regulation is likely reciprocal, as we find that removal of hoxa11 paralogs results in an increase in hox13 positive cells in the fin fold ( Figure S7 B).
The necessity of hoxa11 paralogs for the expression of the reph /+ intermediate radial phenotype reveals the presence of a functional Hox code and regulatory network ( Woltering et al., 2014 87. Woltering, J.M. ∙ Noordermeer, D. ∙ Leleu, M. ... Conservation and divergence of regulatory strategies at Hox Loci and the origin of tetrapod digits PLoS Biol. 2014; 12 :e1001773 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ) within developing teleost pectoral fins capable of specifying intermediate domains similar to that found in limbs. This suggests that the intermediate radials have a hox11 dependence and identity, and share developmental homology with the zeugopodial structures of the tetrapod limb ( Figure 7 ). However, the manifestation of this positional code is not normally expressed in teleost fishes but is revealed by the action of the reph and wan mutations.

Section: Discussion

The integration and differentiation of the novel long bones formed in reph and wan pectoral fins is unique among teleost fishes and harkens to the development and anatomy of long bones in the limbs of tetrapods. The common ancestor of all bony fishes, including humans, had a pectoral fin skeleton that consisted of multiple long bones arranged side by side, each articulating with the shoulder ( Figure S1 ) ( Gegenbaur, 1865 24. Gegenbaur, C. Untersuchungen zur vergleichenden Anatomie der Wirbeltiere Wilheim Engelmann, 1865 Google Scholar ; Zhu and Yu, 2009 92. Zhu, M. ∙ Yu, X. Stem sarcopterygians have primitive polybasal fin articulation Biol. Lett. 2009; 5 :372-375 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ‘polybasal’ condition of the endoskeleton consisted of unsegmented elements in the middle and anterior portions of the appendage, and the posterior metapterygium, which branched and was segmented along the PD axis ( Figure 1 A). It is hypothesized that the tetrapod limb skeleton evolved via loss of the anterior components and elaboration of the metapterygium. Teleosts, on the other hand, are thought to have maintained the polybasal condition and lost the metapterygium ( Gegenbaur, 1878 25. Gegenbaur, C. Elements of Comparative Anatomy Macmllan & Co, 1878 Google Scholar ; Grandel, 2003 26. Grandel, H. Approaches to a comparison of fin and limb structure and development Theory Biosci. 2003; 122 :288-301 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ; Tulenko et al., 2016 83. Tulenko, F.J. ∙ Augustus, G.J. ∙ Massey, J.L. ... HoxD expression in the fin-fold compartment of basal gnathostomes and implications for paired appendage evolution Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :22720 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the skeletal elaboration seen in reph and wan is restricted to the posterior region of the pectoral skeleton, resembling the morphology of basal actinopterygian and lobe-finned fishes ( Jessen, 1972 36. Jessen, H.L. Shulterguertel and Pectoralflosse bei Actinopterygiern Martinsson, A. (Editor) Fossils and Strata Universitetsforlaget, 1972; 1-101 Google Scholar ; Coates, 1994 12. Coates, M.I. The origin of vertebrate limbs Dev. Suppl. 1994; 169-180 PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu and Yu, 2009 92. Zhu, M. ∙ Yu, X. Stem sarcopterygians have primitive polybasal fin articulation Biol. Lett. 2009; 5 :372-375 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, our data suggest that teleosts retain a cryptic ancestral axis of growth, corresponding to the metapterygial axis, whose potential for elaboration is revealed by these mutants. The early stages of fin growth in non-teleost actinopterygians, such as Amia or Polyodon that retain a posteriorly articulated metapterygium, segment the endoskeleton after initial pattering of the paddle commences ( Heronimus, 1911 34. Heronimus, C. Die Entwicklung des Brustflossenskelettes bei Amia calva Anat. Anz. 1911; 34 :193-203 Google Scholar ; Davis et al., 2004 16. Davis, M.C. ∙ Shubin, N.H. ∙ Force, A. Pectoral fin and girdle development in the basal actinopterygians Polyodon spathula and Acipenser transmontanus J. Morphol. 2004; 262 :608-628 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). None of these lineages show progressive outgrowth and joint morphogenesis as seen in rephaim . Thus, the overall timing of endoskeletal elaboration mirrors that observed in development of tetrapod limbs more so than basal actinopterygians. Due to the morphological disparity and differential retention of ancestral components of the appendage skeleton in teleosts in contrast to tetrapods ( Figure 1 A), we cannot assign a homology relationship between intermediate radials and any specific element of the limb. Rather, we propose a “deep homology” ( Shubin et al., 2009 70. Shubin, N. ∙ Tabin, C. ∙ Carroll, S. Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty Nature. 2009; 457 :818-823 Crossref Scopus (601) PubMed Google Scholar ) between middle elements of these appendages, whereby Hox11 genes establish an intermediate regionality in which long bones can develop ( Figure 7 ). This highlights the flexibility of developmental programs to traverse morphological boundaries and the potential to blur the distinction between them.
The exact mutations we identify in wasl and vav2 are not observed in tetrapods. However, these mutations reveal a previously unexplored pathway that has unappreciated roles in appendage patterning, and the evolution of which may have played a part in historical changes to appendage structure. It is unlikely that the mutations identified in this study are specifically instructive of limb-ness, but are instead permissive of endogenous limb-like developmental programs latent in fishes. A component of these mutation-activated programs is a functional Hox code, retained in teleost fishes, with specific intermediate ( hoxa11 ) and distal ( hoxa13 ) patterning cues. Here, we have demonstrated genetic interaction between Hox genes and Wasl. Further, we extend these findings to show that Hox responsive cells in the developing pectoral fin are sensitive to changes in Wasl function. These cells exhibit increased expression of hoxa11b during development of the fin, and thus the reph and wan mutants foster conditions that enable the creation of novel skeletal morphologies of the adult fin. Our results reveal latent or emergent properties of development within vertebrate appendages to form elaborate, articulated skeletal structures. That these patterning processes are maintained in both teleosts and tetrapods suggests they were present in the bony fish ancestor and potentially refined in the evolution of lobe-finned fishes during the transition to land.

Homozygous Wasl L2L/L2L mice were crossed to the Cre driver lines. All resulting progeny were phenotypically wild type, and those carrying the driver transgene were both in-crossed to one another and crossed to Wasl L2L/L2L homozygotes. Using the Prrx1-Cre and Hoxb6-Cre drivers, offspring genotypes were observed in the expected ratios and were adult viable. However, no Wasl L2L/L2L ; T-cre pups were ever born. Analysis of pregnant females revealed that Wasl L2L/L2L ; T-cre embryos are not viable past E12.5. For skeletal analysis animals were euthanized at P0 and P30. No sex bias was observed in the severity of skeletal phenotypes or their frequency.
Protein localization assays were carried out in HeLa cells (RRID:CVCL_0058). HeLa cells were seeded on 6-well plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies) and 1000 U penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies).
Whole-exome sequencing was used to map the loci and mutations causing the reph and wan phenotypes through homogeneity-by-descent methods ( Bowen et al., 2012 8. Bowen, M.E. ∙ Henke, K. ∙ Siegfried, K.R. ... Efficient mapping and cloning of mutations in zebrafish by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing Genetics. 2012; 190 :1017-1024 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). As both mutants exhibit dose-dependent phenotypes, homozygotes could be isolated and used for mapping. For each mutant, genomic DNA from 25 F 2 homozygous mutants stemming from a WIK outcross was extracted from whole larvae using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit. 3 μg of pooled DNA was sheared to an average fragment size of 200 bp using a Covaris E220 Focused Ultrasonicator. Barcoded sequencing libraries were prepared from fragmented DNA using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. We used Agilent SureSelect DNA target enrichment baits designed using the Zv9 genome assembly to enrich for coding regions of the zebrafish genome ( Kettleborough et al., 2013 37. Kettleborough, R.N. ∙ Busch-Nentwich, E.M. ∙ Harvey, S.A. ... A systematic genome-wide analysis of zebrafish protein-coding gene function Nature. 2013; 496 :494-497 Crossref Scopus (493) PubMed Google Scholar ). 50 bp single-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq machine, resulting in average exome coverage of 7x for rephaim and 13x for wanda . Fine mapping of linked intervals was performed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis of recombinants using unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLP). Mapping PCR primers are provided in Table S2 .
CRISPR-Cas9 site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate null alleles for each target gene. Suitable target sites located early in the first exon of each gene were selected using CHOPCHOP ( http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/ ) ( Montague et al., 2014 55. Montague, T.G. ∙ Cruz, J.M. ∙ Gagnon, J.A. ...

Guides were synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) for use with their Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 system. Gene-specific guides were multiplexed and injected at a concentration of 6.25 μM each crRNA guide and 500 ng/μL Cas9 mRNA (SBI System Biosciences, CAS500A-1) into single-cell zebrafish embryos. Progeny of injected fish were screened for the presence of inherited lesions resulting in frameshifts and truncations, and these progeny were used as founders of stable mutant lines. Guide sequences and genotyping primers are listed in Table S2 . Amino acid sequence alterations caused by each lesion are reported in Table S3 .
To generate a hoxa11b reporter line ( mh208; hoxa11b Tg(hsp70:tdTomato) ) we used a CRISPSR/Cas9-mediated knock-in strategy ( Auer et al., 2014 5. Auer, T.O. ∙ Duroure, K. ∙ De Cian, A. ... Highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in in zebrafish by homology-independent DNA repair Genome Res. 2014; 24 :142-153 Crossref Scopus (502) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kimura et al., 2014 40. Kimura, Y. ∙ Hisano, Y. ∙ Kawahara, A. ... Efficient generation of knock-in transgenic zebrafish carrying reporter/driver genes by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :6545 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). The hoxa11b_2 guide, located just downstream of the ATG, was injected at a concentration of 15 μM together with the Gbait guide (15 μM), Cas9 mRNA (300 ng/μl, SBI System Biosciences, CAS500A-1) and Gbait:hsp70l:tdTomato plasmid (9ng/μl; gift from Bagnat lab). The plasmid is a modified Gbait:hsp70l:Gal4 plasmid described in Kimura et al., 2014 where the Gal4 coding sequence was replaced by tdTomato .
Injected fish were sorted for tdTomato expression and raised to adulthood. Transgenic founders were identified by out crossing injected fish to wild-type fish and isolating tdTomato positive F 1 fish. To sequence the insertion site and to identify orientation of the insertion, genomic primers (hoxa11b_KI_F and hoxa11b_KI_R) were each paired with plasmid-specific primers (hsp70_R or LacZ_F) in genotyping PCRs. The Gbait:hsp70l:tdTomato plasmid is integrated in the reverse orientation in the hoxa11b locus in the isolated hoxa11b Tg(hsp70:tdTomato) line. CRISPR guide and genotyping primer sequences are given in Table S2 .
Zebrafish Staining: Adult fish were fixed overnight at room temperature with agitation in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. After fixation, fish were rinsed briefly with PBS and stepped through one-h ethanol/distilled water washes, with 30%, 50%, 70%, 95%, and finally 100% ethanol. Cartilage was then stained overnight at room temperature with 0.015% Alcian Blue 8GX in 30% acetic acid in ethanol. One-h ethanol/distilled water washes were then used to move the animals through 100%, 70%, 50%, 30% ethanol, and then washed twice in tap water. Fish were then macerated using 0.15% trypsin in 65% saturated sodium borax solution at 37°C. Typically fish were digested for 1 to 3 h, stopping the process once the caudal peduncle and anal fin radials were visible when held up to light. Mineralized tissues were then stained with 0.25% Alizarin Red S in 0.5% KOH (potassium hydroxide) overnight. If one night of staining was inadequate, a second overnight wash was performed with fresh staining solution. For storage and imaging, stained fish were then moved through a glycerol/0.5% KOH series using overnight washes of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% glycerol in 0.5% KOH, and finally 100% glycerol. Larval and juvenile fish were stained with the same protocol, with the exception that larval fish were left in the cartilage stain for only 4 h. All wash volumes are 20 mL and all steps were performed in glass scintillation vials.
Mouse Staining: Carcasses were skinned and fixed overnight in 95% ethanol. Specimens were then stained overnight in Alcian Blue staining solution (8 parts 95% ethanol to 2 parts Glacial acetic acid, with 0.15 mg Alcian Blue 8GX added per milliliter). After Alcian Blue staining, specimens were washed in 95% ethanol for several h. Specimens were then cleared for one to several days using 2% KOH. Once specimens were cleared, there were stained overnight in Alizarin Red staining solution (1% KOH, 15 mg Alizarin Red per milliliter). If staining is inadequate after one night, fresh Alizarin Red stain was added for a second night. After Alizarin Red staining, specimens are moved through a series of overnight washes of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% glycerol in 0.5% KOH, and finally 100% glycerol. All fixation and staining steps were carried out at room temperature with gentle rocking agitation. P0 mice were stained using 20 mL wash volumes, and adult mice were stained using 50 mL wash volumes.
Wild-type and reph /+ 7 dpf larvae were stained with Alcian Blue as described above. After staining, pectoral fins were removed and imaged and the endoskeletal disc and fin fold were measured using integrated measurement tools in the Nikon Imaging Software and ImageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2015 67. Schindelin, J. ∙ Rueden, C.T. ∙ Hiner, M.C. ... The ImageJ ecosystem: An open platform for biomedical image analysis Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2015; 82 :518-529 Crossref Scopus (1884) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each fin, each area was measured in triplicate and the average of these three measures taken to be used in statistical analysis. Statistical comparison of average disc size was performed by Welch’s Two Sample t test in the R statistical module ( R Core Team, 2014 65. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2014 Google Scholar ).
Wild-type and reph /+ siblings at 5 wpf were stained with Alcian Blue and Alizarin Red as described above. After moving stained specimens into glycerol, the cartilages fluoresce using EGFP filter settings (Ex488/Em507). Cartilage fluorescence following Alcian Blue staining has also been reported in lamprey ( Martin et al., 2009 51. Martin, W.M. ∙ Bumm, L.A. ∙ McCauley, D.W. Development of the viscerocranial skeleton during embryogenesis of the sea lamprey, Petromyzon Marinus Dev. Dyn. 2009; 238 :3126-3138 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stained radials were scanned using a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope and 1.5 μm optical sections were taken. Cell area measurements for wild-type 4 th proximal radials (n = 7), reph /+ 4 th proximal radials (n = 7), and reph /+ 4 th intermediate radials (n = 7) were made in ImageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2015 67. Schindelin, J. ∙ Rueden, C.T. ∙ Hiner, M.C. ... The ImageJ ecosystem: An open platform for biomedical image analysis Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2015; 82 :518-529 Crossref Scopus (1884) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each element, all cells with clear boundaries in the section were measured, and the average cell area for each individual element was calculated from these values. The distribution of average cell areas from each element was then compared with a one way ANOVA test in the R statistical module ( R Core Team, 2014 65. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2014 Google Scholar ).
Whole-mount immunolabeling of actinotrichia collagen filaments was performed as previously described ( Masselink et al., 2016 52. Masselink, W. ∙ Cole, N.J. ∙ Fenyes, F. ... A somitic contribution to the apical ectodermal ridge is essential for fin formation Nature. 2016; 535 :542-546 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lalonde and Akimenko, 2018 45. Lalonde, R.L. ∙ Akimenko, M.A. Effects of fin fold mesenchyme ablation on fin development in zebrafish PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0192500 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Wash steps were performed following Hammond-Weinberger and ZeRuth (2020) 32. Hammond-Weinberger, D.R. ∙ ZeRuth, G.T. Whole Mount Immunohistochemistry in Zebrafish Embryos and Larvae J. Vis. Exp. 2020; 155 Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar with the exception that the specimens were not subjected to methanol, and the proteinase-K and re-fix steps were omitted. All wash steps were carried out with rocking agitation. Specimens were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at 4°C in light-blocking containers. Following fixation, specimens were rinsed 3 times for 5 min each with phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 (PBSX). Specimens were then blocked for two h at room temperature in PBSX with 10% Goat Serum. After blocking, specimens were incubated overnight at 4°C in the primary mouse anti-Collagen II antibody (II-II6B3-c) from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at a dilution of 1:100 in PBSX with 1% Goat Serum. The next day specimens were rinsed 5 times for 10 min each in PBSX. After rinsing, specimens were incubated overnight at 4°C in the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody conjugated to AlexaFlour 488 (Invitrogen Catalog #A-11001) at a 1:500 dilution in PBSX with 1% Goat Serum. To label F-actin, fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin from Biotium (CF405M, Catalog no. 00034-T) was added along with the secondary antibody at a final concentration of 5U/mL. The following day specimens were rinsed 3 times for 10 min each and subsequently imaged.
Heterozygous reph/+ mutants were crossed to reph /+ animals carrying one copy of the hoxa11b Tg(hsp70:tdTomato) endogenous reporter, and their reporter-positive progeny were collected at 3, 6, and 9 dpf. Collected progeny were fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C in 5 mL glass vials inside of light-blocking containers. After fixation, specimens were rinsed twice for 10 min each in PBST, and stored in at 4°C in fresh PBST. Specimens were then imaged on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope. Laser and filter settings were kept constant across siblings of the same age that were to be compared, but higher laser settings needed to be used for the 6 and 9 dpf specimens. Four to five individuals of each genotype (+/+, reph /+, and reph / reph ) were scanned for each stage. Full projections from each fin were exported to ImageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2015 67. Schindelin, J. ∙ Rueden, C.T. ∙ Hiner, M.C. ... The ImageJ ecosystem: An open platform for biomedical image analysis Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2015; 82 :518-529 Crossref Scopus (1884) PubMed Google Scholar ), and intensity was measured in a 300 μm x 300 μm square centered on the distal edge of the disc, such that half the square included the distal endoskeletal disc and half included the proximal fin fold. This region of interest could be reliably specified across samples. Average intensity for this region was measured for each individual, and for each time point, the average wild-type intensity was used to normalize intensity values such that average wild-type intensity for each stage was equal to 1. Average relative intensities for each genotype were then compared using Welch’s t test in R ( R Core Team, 2014 65. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2014 Google Scholar ). This same crossing scheme and experimental design was also repeated in wan mutants.
Fish were fixed overnight in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. After fixation, the pectoral girdle was removed and decalcified in 10% EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) for several days, with daily solution changes. Following decalcification, fins were embedded in paraffin using standard practices. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining was performed using standard protocols.
Fixation: Specimens for in situ hybridization (ISH) were fixed overnight in 4% PFA in PBS pH 7.4 at 4°C with gentile rocking agitation. Following fixation, specimens were rinsed twice for 10 min each with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20 (PBST), rinsed once for 10 min in 100% methanol, then stored at −20°C in fresh 100% methanol. Specimens were stored at −20°C for at least 2 weeks prior to ISH.
Whole-mount ISH: Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed following Lufkin (2007) 50. Lufkin, T. In situ hybridization of whole-mount mouse embryos with RNA probes: hybridization, washes, and histochemistry CSH Protocols. 2007; Crossref Google Scholar with minor modifications. Following storage, specimens were rehydrated through a series of 10-min methanol/PBST washes, moving from 75% methanol in PBST, to 50% methanol in PBST, to 25% methanol in PBST, followed by 2 PBST washes. Specimens were then treated with 2.5 μg/mL Proteinase K for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a brief rinse in PBST with added 2 mg/mL glycine and then a 10 min wash in PBST. Following this, specimens were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature, then rinsed twice for 10 min each with PBST. Specimens were then rinsed in 1:1 PBST: Hybridization Mix, (50 mL Hybridization Mix: 25 mL deionized formamide, 3.25 mL 20x SSC pH 5.0, 0.5 mL 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0, 250 μL 10 mg/mL yeast RNA, 1 mL 10% Tween 20, 2.5 mL CHAPS, 100 μL 50 mg/mL heparin, 17.4 mL RNase-free water), followed by a 5 min rinse in Hybridization Mix. Specimens were then prehybridized in a fresh Hybridization Mix wash at 60°C for 1 h. After prehybridization, fresh Hybridization Mix containing 100 ng RNA probe per 100 μL was added and specimens were hybridized overnight 60°C. The next day, specimens were rinsed twice in prewarmed Hybridization Mix, and then moved through four 1 h washes with Hybridization Mix at 60°C. Specimens were then washed for 10 min at 60°C in 1:1 Hybridization Mix: maleic acid buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (MABT), followed by two rinses with MABT and then a 10 min MABT wash. This was followed by a 1 h blocking wash at room temperature in MABT with added 2% Blocking Reagent (Roche Cat. No. 11096176001). After the first block, a second 1 h blocking wash was conducted in MABT with 2% Blocking Reagent and 20% heat-inactivated sheep serum. Specimens were then immunolabeled in a fresh volume of MABT with 2% Blocking Reagent and 20% heat-inactivated sheep serum with AP-anti-DIG antibody (Roche Cat. No. 11093274910) added at a 1:2000 dilution overnight at 4°C. The following day, specimens were rinsed three times in MABT for 5 min each, then washed five times in MABT for one h each, and then washed overnight at 4°C in fresh MABT. Next, specimens were rinsed three times for 10 min each in NTMT (30 mL NTMT: 0.75 mL 4M NaCl, 3 mL 1M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 1.5 mL 1M MgCl 2 , 0.33 g Tween 20, 24.5 mL water). Specimens were then moved to 12-well plates and incubated in BM-Purple (Roche Cat. No. 11442074001) in the dark at room temperature. Once specimens developed signal, they were rinsed twice in PBST and then fixed for 2 h in 4% PFA in PBS at room temperature. After fixation, specimens were rinsed twice with PBST and then stored in a fresh volume of PBST at 4°C until they were photographed. All washes were carried out at a volume of 1 mL with gentle rocking agitation.
Section ISH: in situ hybridization on sections was performed following Smith et al. (2008) 72. Smith, A. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Guay, D. ... Gene expression analysis on sections of zebrafish regenerating fins reveals limitations in the whole-mount in situ hybridization method Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237 :417-425 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar . Following storage, specimens were rehydrated through a series of 10-min methanol/PBST washes, moving from 75% methanol in PBST, to 50% methanol in PBST, to 25% methanol in PBST, followed by 2 PBST washes. Adult fins were then decalcified overnight in 10% EDTA pH 7.6 at room temperature. Fins were then soaked in 15% sucrose in PBST for 1 h at room temperature, followed by an overnight wash in 30% sucrose at 4°C. The next day, specimens were moved into 1:1 30% sucrose: OCT (Optimal Cutting Temperature, Sakura) for 1 h. Specimens were then transferred into OCT blocks and frozen using an ethanol/dry ice bath, and stored at −80°C. Blocks were sectioned on a Leica CM 3050 S cryostat at a thickness of 10 μm, and sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Thermo Scientific, Cat. No. 4951PLUS4). Sections were stored at −80°C until used for ISH.
Slides were thawed and dried at room temperature. Edges of the slide were lined with a hydrophobic pen. 100 ng of probe was diluted at 1:200 in Hybridization Buffer (50 mL Hybridization Buffer: 25 mL deionized formamide, 250 μL 10 mg/mL yeast RNA, 5 mL dextran sulfate, 1 mL 50x Denhardt’s Solution, 10 mL 5x Salt Solution (50 mL 5x Salt Solution: 12.5 mL 4M NaCl, 2.5 mL 1M Tris-HCl, 1.25 mL 1M NaH2PO4, 1.25 mL Na2HPO4, 0.25 mL 1M Tris-Base, 5 mL 0.25M EDTA, 27.25 mL water)). Probe in Hybridization Buffer was denatured at 70°C for 10 min and then placed on ice. Each slide had 300 μL of denatured probe applied and was coverslipped, placed in a humidity chamber, and hybridized overnight at 65°C. The next day, slides were washed in Coplin Jars with 45 mL wash volumes. First, slides were washed for 15 min at 65°C in Solution A preheated to 65°C (300 mL Solution A: 150 mL deionized formamide, 15 mL 20x SSC pH 7, 3 mL 10% Tween 20, 132 mL water). Slides were then washed for 30 min in prewarmed Solution A at 65°C, followed by two 30 min washes at room temperature in MABT. Slides were then blocked with a 1 h wash in MABT with added 20% heat inactivated sheep serum. After blocking, slides were inoculated overnight at 4°C with 300 μL AP-anti-DIG antibody diluted 1:2000 in MABT with 20% heat inactivated sheep serum, and coverslipped in a humidity chamber. The following day, slides were wash again in Coplin Jars. Slides were washed four times for 20 min each in MABT, and then washed two times for 10 min each in NTMT. Slides were then covered with 500 μL BM-purple and left to develop in the dark at room temperature in a humidity chamber. After signal developed, slides were rinsed twice with 500 μL PBST and then fixed overnight with 500 μL 4% PFA in PBS at 4°C in a humidity chamber. The next day, slides were washed for 5 min in water and allowed to briefly air dry. While slides were still slightly moist, they were mounted with CC/Mount (Sigma-Aldrich Cat. No. C9368). Mounted slides were stored in the dark at room temperature until they were photographed.
The gene fusion construct mEmerald-N-Wasp-C-18, consisting of an N-terminal GFP fused to the Mus musculus Wasl coding region driven by the CMV promoter, was a gift from Michael Davidson (Addgene plasmid #54199). Site-directed mutagenesis via the QuikChange II XL kit (Agilent) was used to introduce the S249P mutation with the primers Wasl_S249P_A and Wasl_S249P_B (sequence listed in Table S2 ). HeLa cells were seeded on 6-well plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies) and 1000 U penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were transfected using FuGENE transfection reagent (Promega) with either 1 μg wild-type plasmid or S249P construct plasmid. Two days after transfection, cells were given fresh media, stained with NucBlue Live Cell Stain (Molecular Probes), and photographed using a Zeiss EVOS imaging system.
Statistical details of experiments can be found in the legends of the figures in which the relevant results are presented. All statistical analysis was performed in the R module ( R Core Team, 2014 65. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2014 Google Scholar ). Welch’s Two Sample t test was used to compare fin fold area and endoskeletal disc area ( Figure 2 B), reporter expression intensity ( Figures 6 and S7 ), and number of hox13-positive cells ( Figure S7 ). One Way ANOVA was used to compare average cell size in condenstations ( Figure 2 F). In analysis of fin fold and endoskeletal disc area, reporter expression intensity, and hox13-positive cells, n is the number of individual fins that were measured. In analysis of average cell size, n is the number of individual radial elements that were measured. For analyses using Welch’s Two Sample t test, significance was considered to be a value of p < 0.05. For the analysis using One Way ANOVA, significance was considered to be a value of p < 0.05. Since significance threshold was not reached in the ANOVA, post hoc testing was not performed. To the extent possible, measurements were performed prior to genotyping of the specimens. However, the reph /+ radial segmentation phenotype is readily apparent and blinding is not possible in this case. In the data represented in boxplots, the heavy bar indicates the median, the box includes the 2 nd and 3 rd quartiles, and the whiskers denote the 1 st and 4 th quartiles.
