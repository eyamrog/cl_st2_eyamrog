Title: Origin and Function of Stress-Induced IL-6 in Murine Models


Abstract: Summary

Acute psychological stress has long been known to decrease host fitness to inflammation in a wide variety of diseases, but how this occurs is incompletely understood. Using mouse models, we show that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the dominant cytokine inducible upon acute stress alone. Stress-inducible IL-6 is produced from brown adipocytes in a beta-3-adrenergic-receptor-dependent fashion. During stress, endocrine IL-6 is the required instructive signal for mediating hyperglycemia through hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is necessary for anticipating and fueling “fight or flight” responses. This adaptation comes at the cost of enhancing mortality to a subsequent inflammatory challenge. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the ontogeny and adaptive purpose of IL-6 as a bona fide stress hormone coordinating systemic immunometabolic reprogramming. This brain-brown fat-liver axis might provide new insights into brown adipose tissue as a stress-responsive endocrine organ and mechanistic insight into targeting this axis in the treatment of inflammatory and neuropsychiatric diseases.

Section: Introduction

Acute life stressors have been observed to decompensate a wide range of inflammatory diseases since antiquity ( Hippocrates, 1849 32. Hippocrates The genuine works of Hippocrates/translated from the Greek, with a preliminary discourse and annotations by Francis Adams, in two volumes The Sydenham Society, 1849 Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2017 48. Liu, Y.Z. ∙ Wang, Y.X. ∙ Jiang, C.L. Inflammation: The Common Pathway of Stress-Related Diseases Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :316 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most chronic sterile inflammatory diseases are known to “flare” after acute stress, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality. Indeed, psychosocial stress worsens most inflammatory diseases, including allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancers ( Batty et al., 2017 6. Batty, G.D. ∙ Russ, T.C. ∙ Stamatakis, E. ...

In human studies, stress induces measurable changes in biology, such as in the magnitude of inflammatory cytokines and in functional changes within relevant end-organs, such as in pulmonary function in the case of allergic inflammation ( Liu et al., 2002 47. Liu, L.Y. ∙ Coe, C.L. ∙ Swenson, C.A. ... School examinations enhance airway inflammation to antigen challenge Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165 :1062-1067 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). Concordantly, several randomized controlled trials targeting stress management have largely lead to improvement in the morbidity of inflammatory diseases ( Black and Slavich, 2016 9. Black, D.S. ∙ Slavich, G.M. Mindfulness meditation and the immune system: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials Ann. N Y Acad.

Simpson, R. ∙ Booth, J. ∙ Lawrence, M. ... Mindfulness based interventions in multiple sclerosis--a systematic review BMC Neurol. 2014; 14 :15 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the well-studied mediators of stress physiology, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines, are primarily thought to be immunosuppressive ( Russell and Lightman, 2019 81. Russell, G. ∙ Lightman, S. The human stress response Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2019; 15 :525-534 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ) and used therapeutically for this purpose, creating a paradox that many have tried to resolve for over 30 years ( Frank et al., 2013 28. Frank, M.G. ∙ Watkins, L.R. ∙ Maier, S.F. Stress-induced glucocorticoids as a neuroendocrine alarm signal of danger Brain Behav. Immun. 2013; 33 :1-6 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ; Munck et al., 1984 58. Munck, A. ∙ Guyre, P.M. ∙ Holbrook, N.J. Physiological functions of glucocorticoids in stress and their relation to pharmacological actions Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5 :25-44 Crossref Scopus (2544) PubMed Google Scholar ). How does psychological stress, which leads to the production of immunosuppressive mediators such as cortisol and catecholamines, decrease host fitness to inflammation?
Studies dating back to 1990 have shown that psychological stress increases circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in humans and laboratory animals ( Cheng et al., 2015 16. Cheng, Y. ∙ Jope, R.S. ∙ Beurel, E. A pre-conditioning stress accelerates increases in mouse plasma inflammatory cytokines induced by stress BMC Neurosci. 2015; 16 :31 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; LeMay et al., 1990 46. LeMay, L.G. ∙ Vander, A.J. ∙ Kluger, M.J. The effects of psychological stress on plasma interleukin-6 activity in rats Physiol. Behav. 1990; 47 :957-961 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maes et al., 1998 51. Maes, M. ∙ Song, C. ∙ Lin, A. ... The effects of psychological stress on humans: increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a Th1-like response in stress-induced anxiety Cytokine. 1998; 10 :313-318 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). The role that IL-6 plays in the acute stress response, also referred to as the “fight or flight” response, is unclear. The idea that stress itself induces endocrine mediators like IL-6, which is traditionally associated with inflammation, has since been supported by the detection of increased circulating cytokines in depression and anxiety ( Felger and Lotrich, 2013 25. Felger, J.C. ∙ Lotrich, F.E. Inflammatory cytokines in depression: neurobiological mechanisms and therapeutic implications Neuroscience. 2013; 246 :199-229 Crossref Scopus (815) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khandaker et al., 2014 39. Khandaker, G.M. ∙ Pearson, R.M. ∙ Zammit, S. ... Association of serum interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein in childhood with depression and psychosis in young adult life: a population-based longitudinal study JAMA Psychiatry. 2014; 71 :1121-1128 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by the association of IL-6 polymorphisms in individuals with depression ( Zhang et al., 2016 101. Zhang, C. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Zhao, G. ... Identification of IL6 as a susceptibility gene for major depressive disorder Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :31264 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, there is a robust relationship between depression and anxiety and poor outcomes in inflammatory diseases ( Eisner et al., 2005 22. Eisner, M.D. ∙ Katz, P.P. ∙ Lactao, G. ... Impact of depressive symptoms on adult asthma outcomes Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2005; 94 :566-574 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Satin et al., 2009 82. Satin, J.R. ∙ Linden, W. ∙ Phillips, M.J. Depression as a predictor of disease progression and mortality in cancer patients: a meta-analysis Cancer. 2009; 115 :5349-5361 Crossref Scopus (757) PubMed Google Scholar ). This body of research has led to clinical trials assessing the efficacy of an antagonizing monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6 receptor subunit alpha (IL-6Ra), tocilizumab—used in rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis—in depression ( Kappelmann et al., 2018 35. Kappelmann, N. ∙ Lewis, G. ∙ Dantzer, R. ... Antidepressant activity of anti-cytokine treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials of chronic inflammatory conditions Mol. Psychiatry. 2018; 23 :335-343 Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ), despite little understanding of how and why stress induces IL-6. The possibility that stress-inducible cytokines, as opposed to glucocorticoids or catecholamines, underlie how stress leads to poorer outcomes in inflammatory diseases has not been explored in depth.
Here, we report that commonly utilized models of acute stress in mice induce endocrine IL-6. Stress-induced IL-6 requires consciousness and beta-3-adrenergic-receptor signaling in brown adipocytes. IL-6 is required for stress hyperglycemia, a metabolic adaptation that enables the “fight or flight” response, via hepatic gluconeogenesis. The cost of stress-induced IL-6 is that it decreases host fitness to a subsequent inflammatory challenge. Our studies therefore mechanistically uncover the origin and adaptive function of IL-6 in acute stress and its cost in the setting of inflammation in mice.

Section: Results

We found that standard laboratory models of acute stress—including tube restraint, cage switching, and social isolation—induced high levels of circulating IL-6 ( Figure 1 A), consistent with previous studies demonstrating that stress alone induced IL-6 ( Cheng et al., 2015 16. Cheng, Y. ∙ Jope, R.S. ∙ Beurel, E.

The effects of psychological stress on humans: increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a Th1-like response in stress-induced anxiety Cytokine. 1998; 10 :313-318 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unexpectedly, we found that a single, conscious, retro-orbital bleed induced IL-6 ( Figure 1 A). To more comprehensively survey other stress-inducible immune mediators, we screened 32 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the circulation of stressed mice and identified a set of cytokines inducible by stress alone; IL-6 was the most greatly induced cytokine and common to two different stress models ( Figure 1 B). We did not detect corresponding increases in the soluble IL-6 receptor ( Figure S1 A) ( Khokha et al., 2013 40. Khokha, R. ∙ Murthy, A. ∙ Weiss, A. Metalloproteinases and their natural inhibitors in inflammation and immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :649-665 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). The absolute level of IL-6 we detected fell in the middle range of reported levels (50 pg/mL to 200 ng/mL) in inflammatory contexts and above reported ranges post-exercise and in diet-induced obesity (30–100 pg/mL) ( Chowdhury et al., 2020 17.

The Dynamics of Treg/Th17 and the Imbalance of Treg/Th17 in Clonorchis sinensis-Infected Mice PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0143217 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also confirmed that acute, stress-increased IL-6 was independent of handlers (as indicated Figure 1 A–C).
To exclude circadian oscillations leading to fluctuations in IL-6, we measured circulating IL-6 over time by retro-orbital bleeding and observed that repeated bleeding of the same animals sustained high IL-6 levels. When individual cages of unmanipulated, entrained animals were bled at the corresponding Zeitgeber times (five mice per ZT time, bled only once at that ZT time), no such sustained increase in IL-6 was noted, demonstrating that conscious bleeding itself increased circulating IL-6 and that repeated bleeding sustained high IL-6 levels ( Figure 1 C). Thus, in order to gain insight into the kinetics of IL-6 after an acute stress, we subjected several groups of mice to a single retro-orbital bleed, and then sampled individual groups at different time points after the bleed. Circulatory cortisol and noradrenaline were increased within 15 min, peaked at 2 h after acute stress, and returned to baseline by 4 h; however, IL-6, which was significantly increased in blood by 2 h, peaked at 4 h, and was even detectable above baseline 18 h after acute stress ( Figure 1 D). The unique kinetics of stress-induced endocrine IL-6 suggested that it may be mediating more sustained aspects of stress physiology.
Because the adrenal gland is thought to be the major mediator of the acute stress response, and previous reports have described adrenally derived IL-6 ( Päth et al., 2000 66. Päth, G. ∙ Scherbaum, W.A. ∙ Bornstein, S.R. The role of interleukin-6 in the human adrenal gland Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 30 :91-95 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), we asked if the adrenal gland was required for stress-induced IL-6. We found that adrenalectomized mice had significantly higher levels of IL-6 after stress, suggesting that the adrenal gland negatively regulated IL-6 ( Figure S1 B). To address previous reports of cross-talk between IL-6 and adrenal hormones ( Bethin et al., 2000 8. Bethin, K.E. ∙ Vogt, S.K. ∙ Muglia, L.J. Interleukin-6 is an essential, corticotropin-releasing hormone-independent stimulator of the adrenal axis during immune system activation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :9317-9322 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ; Päth et al., 2000 66. Päth, G. ∙ Scherbaum, W.A. ∙ Bornstein, S.R. The role of interleukin-6 in the human adrenal gland Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 30 :91-95 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), we utilized an antagonistic anti-IL-6Ra antibody and found that inhibition of IL-6 signaling did not change circulating levels of corticosterone or noradrenaline after acute stress ( Figures S1 C and S1D). This model avoids the confounding developmental defects observed in constitutive IL-6 knockout animals ( Wallenius et al., 2002 92. Wallenius, V. ∙ Wallenius, K. ∙ Ahrén, B. ... Interleukin-6-deficient mice develop mature-onset obesity Nat. Med. 2002; 8 :75-79 Crossref Scopus (1066) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We then validated previous observations that circulating IL-6 levels were increased in stressed humans ( Felger and Lotrich, 2013 25. Felger, J.C. ∙ Lotrich, F.E. Inflammatory cytokines in depression: neurobiological mechanisms and therapeutic implications Neuroscience. 2013; 246 :199-229 Crossref Scopus (815) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khandaker et al., 2014 39. Khandaker, G.M. ∙ Pearson, R.M. ∙ Zammit, S. ... Association of serum interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein in childhood with depression and psychosis in young adult life: a population-based longitudinal study JAMA Psychiatry. 2014; 71 :1121-1128 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ). We acquired a community sample of individuals that were carefully assessed for high and low stress by using a structured cumulative stress and adversity interview that assessed recent and past life events (Cumulative Adversity Interview) ( Ansell et al., 2012 3. Ansell, E.B. ∙ Rando, K. ∙ Tuit, K. ... Cumulative adversity and smaller gray matter volume in medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and insula regions Biol. Psychiatry. 2012; 72 :57-64 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ; Seo et al., 2014 84. Seo, D. ∙ Tsou, K.A. ∙ Ansell, E.B. ... Cumulative adversity sensitizes neural response to acute stress: association with health symptoms Neuropsychopharmacology. 2014; 39 :670-680 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Turner and Lloyd, 1995 89. Turner, R.J. ∙ Lloyd, D.A. Lifetime traumas and mental health: the significance of cumulative adversity J. Health Soc. Behav. 1995; 36 :360-376 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ). The high and low groups were group matched by age, gender, education, and body mass index ( Figure S1 E). We found significant overall increased IL-6 levels in the high (74 pg/mL, SE: 35) versus low (3.9 pg/mL, SE: 2.78) stress groups (t = 2.15, p < 0.05) ( Figure S1 E). The absolute circulating level of stress-associated IL-6 in humans was a hundred times lower in mice, reflecting inter-species variation and/or acuity, heterogeneity, and magnitude of stressors. Taken together, these data indicate that IL-6 is an endocrine hormone inducible by acute stress alone, with different kinetics than the canonical stress hormones, corticosterone and noradrenaline.
To understand the ontogeny of stress-induced IL-6, we first ensured that IL-6 was not induced by retro-orbital bleeding as a result of bacterial translocation from the skin or gastrointestinal tract ( Kelly et al., 2015 38. Kelly, J.R. ∙ Kennedy, P.J. ∙ Cryan, J.F. ... Breaking down the barriers: the gut microbiome, intestinal permeability and stress-related psychiatric disorders Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2015; 9 :392 Crossref Scopus (792) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with our observations that other acute-phase cytokines were not induced after stress, stress-induced IL-6 was present in both gnotobiotic animals and animals deficient in key signaling pathways necessary for detecting bacteria ( Figure 2 A). Previous reports had suggested that hyperglycemia itself, a characteristic feature of the acute stress response ( Esposito et al., 2002 23. Esposito, K. ∙ Nappo, F. ∙ Marfella, R. ... Inflammatory cytokine concentrations are acutely increased by hyperglycemia in humans: role of oxidative stress Circulation. 2002; 106 :2067-2072 Crossref Scopus (1655) PubMed Google Scholar ), was sufficient to induce IL-6. To test this, we performed an oral glucose tolerance test 4 h post retro-orbital bleeding and found that both glucose and water induced IL-6, suggesting that the acute stress of gavaging and bleeding, but not hyperglycemia, was responsible for IL-6 induction ( Figures S1 F and S1G). We also wanted to exclude the possibility that local damage to the retro-orbital plexus was inducing regional endothelial or immune release of IL-6, and so we sampled the contralateral orbital plexus and did not observe differences between traumatized and untraumatized eyes, suggesting that the contribution of systemic IL-6 was not significantly affected by local damage ( Figure S1 H).
IL-6 is produced by many cell types, including hematopoietic cells, myocytes, endothelial cells, and adipocytes ( Hunter and Jones, 2015 34. Hunter, C.A. ∙ Jones, S.A. IL-6 as a keystone cytokine in health and disease Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16 :448-457 Crossref Scopus (1769) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify the origin of IL-6, we first performed mixed bone marrow chimera studies by using IL-6-deficient animals and found that stress-induced IL-6 was not produced by radiosensitive cells ( Figure 2 B). Given the kinetics of plasma IL-6 after acute stress, we reasoned that IL-6 would be transcriptionally regulated. Thus, we screened multiple tissues for Il6 induction using both the bleeding and tube restraint models. We found that Il6 was robustly induced in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) ( Figure 2 C) and confirmed protein expression by immunohistochemistry ( Figure 2 D). We did not detect increased muscle Il6 , which was consistent with the observation that mice did not significantly increase physical activity after an acute stressor ( Figure S2 B). To test if BAT was the sole source of stress-induced IL-6, we surgically excised the BAT, which ablated the IL-6 response to bleeding stress ( Figure 2 E).
Because BAT is a complex collection of cells including radioresistant immune cells ( Wolf et al., 2017 97. Wolf, Y. ∙ Boura-Halfon, S. ∙ Cortese, N. ... Brown-adipose-tissue macrophages control tissue innervation and homeostatic energy expenditure Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :665-674 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ), we first asked if stress-induced Il6 would be present in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which includes all cells except adipocytes. The purity of our SVF isolation was verified by the absence of Ucp1 and beta-3 adrenergic receptor ( Adrb3 ) expression ( Figures S1 I and S1J). Il6 transcriptional induction was not observed in the SVF fraction from either bled or restrained animals, implying that stress-induced IL-6 was derived from brown adipocytes ( Figure 2 F). Thus, we generated an animal in which Il6 could be inducibly deleted in brown adipocytes by using Ucp1 promoter-driven Cre under the control of estrogen receptor ( Il6 f/f ΔUCP1 ) and detected a significant attenuation of IL-6 after acute stress in these animals ( Figure 2 G). Collectively, our data demonstrate that brown adipocytes are the source of stress-induced IL-6.
Because BAT is critical for non-shivering thermogenesis in cold and psychological stress ( Kataoka et al., 2014 36. Kataoka, N. ∙ Hioki, H. ∙ Kaneko, T. ... Psychological stress activates a dorsomedial hypothalamus-medullary raphe circuit driving brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and hyperthermia Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :346-358 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), we assessed the effect of ambient temperature on stress-induced IL-6. We subjected animals placed in standard cold acclimation (4°C), standard (22°C), and thermoneutral (32°C) conditions to bleeding stress, and did not note any effect on IL-6 induction ( Figure S1 K). To test whether the key mediator of non-shivering thermogenesis, UCP1, was required for IL-6, we tested the IL-6 response in Ucp1 -deficient animals. Consistent with a function independent from thermoregulation, we did not note differences in either endocrine IL-6 levels or BAT transcriptional upregulation of Il6 ( Figures 3 A and 3B). We also did not note any temperature differences after bleeding stress in the presence of IL-6Ra-blocking antibody compared with the isotype control ( Figure S1 L). Transcriptional analyses of BAT after acute stress did not demonstrate induction of Ucp1 or other classic cold-responsive genes ( Figure S1 M). Interestingly, mRNA transcript for Il5 , which was detected as a stress-induced cytokine after bleeding ( Figure 1 B), was also produced in the BAT. This finding is reminiscent of the reported role of IL-5 in BAT adaptation to prolonged cold exposure ( Lee et al., 2015 44. Lee, M.W. ∙ Odegaard, J.I. ∙ Mukundan, L. ... Activated type 2 innate lymphoid cells regulate beige fat biogenesis Cell. 2015; 160 :74-87 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qiu et al., 2014 75. Qiu, Y. ∙ Nguyen, K.D. ∙ Odegaard, J.I. ... Eosinophils and type 2 cytokine signaling in macrophages orchestrate development of functional beige fat Cell. 2014; 157 :1292-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We reasoned that consciousness would be required for IL-6 response to acute stress. Thus, we anesthetized animals with either ketamine/xylazine or isoflurane, after which we subjected them to tube restraint or retro-orbital bleeding and found that anesthesia abrogated stress-induced IL-6 ( Figure 3 C). Because sympathetic outflow to BAT is well-described in settings of acute exposure to cold ( Kawate et al., 1994 37. Kawate, R. ∙ Talan, M.I. ∙ Engel, B.T. Sympathetic nervous activity to brown adipose tissue increases in cold-tolerant mice Physiol. Behav. 1994; 55 :921-925 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nguyen et al., 2017 62. Nguyen, N.L. ∙ Barr, C.L. ∙ Ryu, V. ... Separate and shared sympathetic outflow to white and brown fat coordinately regulates thermoregulation and beige adipocyte recruitment Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2017; 312 :R132-R145 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) and psychological stress ( Kataoka et al., 2014 36. Kataoka, N. ∙ Hioki, H. ∙ Kaneko, T. ... Psychological stress activates a dorsomedial hypothalamus-medullary raphe circuit driving brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and hyperthermia Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :346-358 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), where projections originate from the rostral medullary raphe region and dorsomedial hypothalamus, we hypothesized that IL-6 was induced via beta-adrenergic signaling. To test if sympathetic neurons were required for stress-induced IL-6, we utilized 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) at doses that achieve significant BAT sympathectomy without significant effects on the CNS ( Depocas et al., 1984 21. Depocas, F. ∙ Foster, D.O. ∙ Zaror-Behrens, G. ... Recovery of function in sympathetic nerves of interscapular brown adipose tissue of rats treated with 6-hydroxydopamine Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1984; 62 :1327-1332 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 6-OHDA treatment, we found that stress-inducible IL-6 was significantly attenuated, confirming that sympathetic outflow was required ( Figure 3 D). Because all three beta-adrenergic receptors are present in BAT ( Figures S1 J, S1N, and S1O), we asked which of these played a role in mediating stress-induced IL-6. We thus challenged animals with ADRB agonists and found that the ADRB3 agonist CL316,243, but not the ADRB1/2 agonist isoproterenol, was sufficient to induce IL-6 ( Figures 3 E and 3F), consistent with previous reports ( Kosteli et al., 2010 42. Kosteli, A. ∙ Sugaru, E. ∙ Haemmerle, G. ... Weight loss and lipolysis promote a dynamic immune response in murine adipose tissue J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120 :3466-3479 Crossref Scopus (552) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2014 100. Zhang, W. ∙ Mottillo, E.P. ∙ Zhao, J. ... Adipocyte lipolysis-stimulated interleukin-6 production requires sphingosine kinase 1 activity J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :32178-32185 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Concordantly, pre-treatment with the pharmacologic inhibitor of ADRB3, but not ADRB1/2 ( Figures 3 G and S1 P) or genetic deletion of Adrb3 ( Figure 3 H), abrogated stress-induced IL-6. These experiments demonstrate that A DRB3 is necessary and sufficient for acute-stress-induced IL-6. Because many cell types express Adrb3 , we generated animals in which Adrb3 could be inducibly deleted from brown adipocytes ( Adrb3 f/f ΔUCP1 ) and verified that tamoxifen induction efficiently deleted Adrb3 ( Figure S1 Q). As expected, and consistent with Il6 f/f ΔUCP1 animals ( Figure 2 G), stress-inducible IL-6 was significantly attenuated in Adrb3 f/f ΔUCP1 mice ( Figure 3 I). These data are consistent with a UCP1-independent ADRB3-dependent endocrine function of brown adipocytes and suggest that BAT may function as an endocrine organ sensitive to adrenergic outflow triggered by acute stress.
Given the large induction of IL-6 by stress alone, we hypothesized that IL-6 was coordinating stress physiology. Classical “fight or flight” physiology includes autonomic outflow and metabolic reprogramming toward catabolic metabolism, which is thought to fuel the increased energy demand anticipated in threatening situations ( Russell and Lightman, 2019 81. Russell, G. ∙ Lightman, S. The human stress response Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2019; 15 :525-534 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not detect significant changes in the quantity of canonical stress hormones ( Figures S1 C and S1D) or stress-induced heart rate or hypertension ( Figure S2 A) after acute stress in the absence of IL-6 function, suggesting that autonomic output was not significantly impacted by IL-6. In contrast, using indirect calorimetry, we did detect significant differences in the overall energy expenditure of stressed animals in which IL-6 signaling was antagonized ( Figure 4 A) despite no significant changes in total activity of animals in either group ( Figure S2 B). We thus hypothesized that organismal metabolic re-programming was likely a key function of stress-induced IL-6, consistent with the numerous studies that have reported a role for IL-6 in affecting organismal metabolism in various contexts ( Covarrubias and Horng, 2014 19.

We thus examined metabolic changes induced by acute stress at the peak of endocrine IL-6 levels. We found that stress-induced hyperglycemia was durable at 4 h after acute stress in an IL-6Ra-dependent fashion ( Figure 4 B). A single bolus of stress-dosed IL-6 was also sufficient to recapitulate the effects of acute stress ( Figure S2 C), indicating that IL-6 was both necessary and sufficient to induce stress-hyperglycemia at this time point. Hyperglycemia is caused by impaired clearance (insulin resistance) and/or excess glucose production from glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. To determine which of these processes was causing hyperglycemia, we tested organismal insulin resistance with a glucose tolerance test (GTT) and did not detect significant differences between stressed and unstressed animals ( Figure S2 D). Likewise, we did not detect differences in GTT in mice challenged with a single bolus of stress-dosed IL-6 ( Figure S2 E) nor did we detect changes in plasma insulin at peak glycemia after IL-6 challenge ( Figure S2 F), suggesting the absence of an effect of IL-6 on insulin-dependent glucose uptake. However, when we performed insulin tolerance tests (ITT), we observed that acute stress alleviated insulin-induced hypoglycemia at later time points ( Figure S2 G), suggesting that stress-induced IL-6 might potentiate endogenous glucose production. Consistent with this idea, a single dose of recombinant IL-6 was also sufficient to recapitulate the effects of acute stress on maintaining higher levels of glucose at late time points during ITT ( Figure S2 H), and IL-6Ra blockade in stressed animals attenuated the ability of mice to maintain normoglycemia after insulin challenge ( Figure S2 I). We tested the contribution of glycogenolysis to stress hyperglycemia by examining glycogen content in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle after stress but did not detect significant differences ( Figure S2 J). We thus hypothesized that IL-6 was inducing gluconeogenesis during stress.
Gluconeogenesis is typically engaged in hypoglycemic or net negative energy balance states, with the exception of forced intensive exercise, where muscle-derived IL-6 has been shown to induce gluconeogenesis ( Banzet et al., 2009 5. Banzet, S. ∙ Koulmann, N. ∙ Simler, N. ... Control of gluconeogenic genes during intense/prolonged exercise: hormone-independent effect of muscle-derived IL-6 on hepatic tissue and PEPCK mRNA J. Appl. Physiol. (1985). 2009; 107 :1830-1839 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Febbraio et al., 2004 24. Febbraio, M.A. ∙ Hiscock, N. ∙ Sacchetti, M. ... Interleukin-6 is a novel factor mediating glucose homeostasis during skeletal muscle contraction Diabetes. 2004; 53 :1643-1648 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test if gluconeogenesis was impaired in an IL-6-dependent fashion, we measured endogenous glucose production after acute stress and found that it was significantly decreased in the absence of IL-6 signaling ( Figure 4 C). This finding was supported by pyruvate tolerance tests (PTT) in stressed animals, where pyruvate conversion to glucose was impaired in the absence of IL-6Ra signaling ( Figure 4 D). Consistent with our previous findings, we found that the effects of IL-6Ra antagonism could be fully recapitulated by using Il6 f/f ΔUCP1 and Adrb3 f/f ΔUCP1 animals, which lack stress-inducible IL-6 ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Gluconeogenic capacity is mediated by key rate-limiting enzymes, many of which have been shown to be sensitive to IL-6 signaling via STAT3 regulatory elements ( Banzet et al., 2009 5. Banzet, S. ∙ Koulmann, N. ∙ Simler, N. ... Control of gluconeogenic genes during intense/prolonged exercise: hormone-independent effect of muscle-derived IL-6 on hepatic tissue and PEPCK mRNA J. Appl. Physiol. (1985). 2009; 107 :1830-1839 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus assessed the hepatic transcriptional induction of Pck1 , G6pc , and other gluconeogenic genes and found that Pck1 and G6pc were significantly increased after acute stress ( Figure 4 G).
Given the close crosstalk between glucose and lipid metabolism ( Weickert and Pfeiffer, 2006 95. Weickert, M.O. ∙ Pfeiffer, A.F. Signalling mechanisms linking hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism Diabetologia. 2006; 49 :1732-1741 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), observations of hyperlipidemia in patients receiving anti-IL-6Ra antibodies, as well as the role of free fatty acids on hepatic glucose production ( Boden et al., 1994 10. Boden, G. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Ruiz, J. ... Mechanisms of fatty acid-induced inhibition of glucose uptake J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93 :2438-2446 Crossref Scopus (877) PubMed Google Scholar ), we studied lipid metabolism in response to acute stress. The circulating level of free fatty acids and glycerol were not significantly altered in response to retro-orbital bleeding ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Acute stress decreased circulating triglyceride (TG) levels ( Figure S3 C), which was likely a result of both enhanced TG clearance ( Figure S3 D) and suppressed hepatic TG production ( Figure S3 E). Consistent with clinical observations from patients treated with tocilizumab, anti-IL-6Ra did increase TG in the non-stressed condition ( Figure S3 F). However, manipulation of IL-6 signaling did not significantly impact triglyceride metabolism in response to acute stress, although stress-induced hypertriglyceridemia did trend lower in IL-6Ra antagonized animals ( Figure S3 F). We did not detect differences in TG, free fatty acids, glycerol, or β-hydroxybutyrate after intravenous injection of IL-6 ( Figures S3 H–S3K) or IL-6Ra blockade ( Figure S3 G), nor did we detect changes in lipolytic capacity in mice with conditional Il6ra deletion in adipose tissue ( Figure S3 L). Finally, we were unable to detect differences in in vivo fatty acid turnover after anti-IL-6Ra treatment ( Figure S3 M). Thus, we found that the dominant effect of IL-6 during acute stress is in inducing gluconeogenesis in the absence of a negative energy state to support stress-induced hyperglycemia.
Because the liver and kidney are the major glucose-producing organs ( Stumvoll et al., 1998 87. Stumvoll, M. ∙ Meyer, C. ∙ Perriello, G. ... Human kidney and liver gluconeogenesis: evidence for organ substrate selectivity Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274 :E817-E826 PubMed Google Scholar ), we surveyed the transcriptional induction of gluconeogenic genes in both organs and found that they were induced by bleeding stress only in the liver ( Figures 5 A and S4 A). We observed that Il6ra was significantly induced in liver but not in kidney ( Figure 5 B), suggesting that the liver might be the primary target for IL-6 signaling in response to acute stress. Concordantly, we found that the IL-6/STAT3 target genes, Saa3 and Socs3 , were also induced in the liver in response to acute stress ( Figures S4 B and S4C). To directly assess gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney, we developed a method to assess the contribution of pyruvate to gluconeogenesis in a tissue-specific manner during stress and found that IL-6Ra antibody suppressed gluconeogenesis from pyruvate in liver but not in kidney ( Figures 5 C and 5D). We did not detect differences in circulating gluconeogenic amino acids ( Figure S4 D). Finally, to directly assess the role of hepatocyte IL-6Ra, we generated mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Il6ra ( Figure S4 E) and performed PTT after acute stress. We found that hepatocyte-specific deletion was sufficient to recapitulate the inhibitory effects of systemic IL-6Ra blockade on gluconeogenesis after bleeding ( Figure 5 E) and restraint stress ( Figure 5 F). These data indicate that stress-inducible IL-6 acts on the liver to induce hepatic gluconeogenesis.
We reasoned that the purpose of activating gluconeogenesis during acute stress, when animals are neither hypoglycemic nor in net-negative energy balance states, is anticipatory of impending increased demand (“fight or flight” response). Consequently, impairment of hepatic gluconeogenesis should be sufficient to affect adaptive behavioral responses to acute stress. To test this, we utilized the light-dark box paradigm. The light-dark box paradigm is a common tool for studying stress response behaviors where animals are placed into a novel environment in which part of the apparatus is exposed under bright light and connected to another enclosed and opaque space by a small opening ( Bourin and Hascoët, 2003 12. Bourin, M. ∙ Hascoët, M. The mouse light/dark box test Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 463 :55-65 Crossref Scopus (1017) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this paradigm, animals must balance the need to explore the novel space with the fear of avoiding possible predation in the exposed area. A normal adaptive response is to spend more time in the dark enclosure. We thus established baseline responses of animals with conditional hepatic deletion of Il6ra and then compared the responses at the peak of endocrine IL-6 after a single, conscious, retro-orbital bleed. We found that hepatic IL-6Ra was required for the normal behavioral response ( Figures 5 G and S4 F). Taken in aggregate, we demonstrate that stress-induced IL-6 mediates stress-hyperglycemia through hepatic IL-6Ra signaling in positive energy balance states, and hepatic IL-6Ra is necessary for a normal behavioral response to acute stress.
Given the many reported roles of IL-6 in affecting inflammatory responses, we reasoned that stress-induced IL-6 might change the outcome of inflammation. We decided to use the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of inflammation, because in this model, mortality is due solely to the inflammatory response without any confounding contribution by pathogens. Animals were subjected to various stress models that induce IL-6 followed by a subsequent LPS challenge. We found that priming animals with stress robustly enhanced mortality to LPS ( Figure 6 A). For the LPS studies, we opted to use the tube-restraint model to avoid confounders associated with the hemodynamic consequences of bleeding. Because we found that ADRB3 activation was sufficient and required for stress-induced IL-6, we pre-treated animals with ADRB agonists and found that pre-treatment with ADRB3 agonist alone was sufficient to enhance LPS mortality ( Figure 6 B). Concordantly, a single injection of stress-dosed IL-6 was sufficient to potentiate LPS-induced mortality ( Figure 6 C). Because stress-induced IL-6 required consciousness, we tested whether or not animals anesthetized prior to tube restraint were still more susceptible to LPS-induced mortality and found that consciousness was required for the stress-priming effect, an effect that could be bypassed with endogenous administration of IL-6 ( Figure 6 D). To test if ADRB3-dependent IL-6 was necessary, ADRB3 antagonist was applied alongside the restraint challenge, which negated the effects of stress-priming ( Figure 6 E). Finally, we asked if Il6 f/f ΔUCP1 animals, which lack stress-inducible IL-6, would be resistant to stress-priming ( Figure 6 F). Consistent with our hypotheses, Il6 f/f ΔUCP1 , which did not display altered susceptibility to LPS in the absence of stress-priming ( Figure S5 A), was resistant to the potentiating effects of tube-restraint on LPS mortality. We also tested the effects of stress-priming by using our Il6ra f/f ΔAlb model. Here, regardless of stress-priming, animals lacking hepatic IL-6 signaling were significantly more sensitive to endotoxemia, suggesting that the hepatic acute phase response was a required adaptation to endotoxemia ( Figure S5 B), consistent with previous reports ( Castell et al., 1989 15. Castell, J.V. ∙ Gómez-Lechón, M.J. ∙ David, M. ... Interleukin-6 is the major regulator of acute phase protein synthesis in adult human hepatocytes FEBS Lett. 1989; 242 :237-239 Crossref Scopus (789) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wunderlich et al., 2010 98. Wunderlich, F.T. ∙ Ströhle, P. ∙ Könner, A.C. ... Interleukin-6 signaling in liver-parenchymal cells suppresses hepatic inflammation and improves systemic insulin action Cell Metab. 2010; 12 :237-249 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also tested if hyperglycemia induced by IL-6 during stress was itself sufficient to prime LPS responses, and thus challenged animals to exogenous glucose to achieve stress hyperglycemia or an isocaloric isovolumetric dose of lipid, and found that glucose, but not lipid, was sufficient to prime the LPS response ( Figure S5 C).
To determine how stress-priming enhanced inflammation-mediated mortality, we first measured cytokine levels and tissue inflammatory gene induction. We did not detect significant changes in circulating or tissue inflammatory cytokines post-LPS in a variety of experimental settings, nor did we detect any changes in tissue inflammatory transcripts or body temperature ( Figures S5 D–S5R and S6 D). Thus, we hypothesized that stress-induced IL-6 might be affecting host tolerance ( Ferreira et al., 2011 26. Ferreira, A. ∙ Marguti, I. ∙ Bechmann, I. ... Sickle hemoglobin confers tolerance to Plasmodium infection Cell. 2011; 145 :398-409 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2016 93.

Because our previous work isolated key brainstem functions (like maintaining heart and respiratory rate) as a target of host tolerance, we also assessed these parameters using our stress paradigm, but did not find significant differences ( Figures S6 A–S6F). We also did not find large differences in maintaining glycemia, fatty acid, or ketone body levels ( Figures S6 I–S6K), which we had previously shown to be important in host tolerance to LPS ( Wang et al., 2016 93. Wang, A. ∙ Huen, S.C. ∙ Luan, H.H. ... Opposing Effects of Fasting Metabolism on Tissue Tolerance in Bacterial and Viral Inflammation Cell. 2016; 166 :1512-1525 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because end-organ dysfunction is a hallmark of inflammatory damage, we assessed biomarkers of vital organ function in stress-primed versus control animals and found that stress-primed animals displayed significantly more renal and a trend toward more cardiac damage, whereas hepatic damage appeared to be equivalent across conditions ( Figures 6 G, S6 G, and S6H). These markers of end-organ damage were absent in stress-primed Il6 f/f ΔUCP1 animals ( Figure 6 H), demonstrating that BAT-derived IL-6 from stress was required for decreasing tolerance to inflammatory damage. Together, these findings suggest that stress decreaseshost tolerance to inflammation in a BAT-derived IL-6-dependent fashion. The precise mechanism by which stress decreases host fitness to inflammation remains to be understood. Altogether, our studies suggest that stress-induced IL-6, although adaptive for supporting fight-or-flight physiology, comes at the cost of decreasing host fitness to endotoxemia-induced inflammation.

Section: Discussion

Psychological stress has been known to induce endocrine IL-6 for nearly 30 years and has been shown in multiple species, including rats, mice, and humans ( Cheng et al., 2015 16. Cheng, Y. ∙ Jope, R.S. ∙ Beurel, E. A pre-conditioning stress accelerates increases in mouse plasma inflammatory cytokines induced by stress BMC Neurosci. 2015; 16 :31 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; LeMay et al., 1990 46. LeMay, L.G. ∙ Vander, A.J. ∙ Kluger, M.J. The effects of psychological stress on plasma interleukin-6 activity in rats Physiol. Behav. 1990; 47 :957-961 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maes et al., 1998 51. Maes, M. ∙ Song, C. ∙ Lin, A. ... The effects of psychological stress on humans: increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a Th1-like response in stress-induced anxiety Cytokine. 1998; 10 :313-318 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mechanistic understanding for this phenomenon has not been addressed. The evolutionary basis for IL-6 induction during acute stress was unknown, and how this might connect to the long-observed connection between stress, metabolism, and inflammation was also unclear. Our study demonstrates that stress-induced IL-6 is produced from brown adipocytes in an ADRB3-dependent fashion in mice. Thermogenic programs were not engaged in this context, and this response was independent of ambient temperature. One key role of stress-induced endocrine IL-6 is in reprogramming organismal metabolism by instructing hepatic gluconeogenesis in the absence of a net negative energy balance or hypoglycemic state, likely in anticipation of increased glucose demand. Hepatic IL-6 signaling was also necessary for mediating normal behavioral responses in the light-dark box paradigm suggesting that hepatic organismal reprogramming is required for an adaptive “fight or flight” response. Finally, we found that stress-induced BAT-derived endocrine IL-6 was necessary and sufficient for decreasing host tolerance to a subsequent inflammatory response by using the endotoxemia model.
Gluconeogenesis is normally not engaged in positive energy balance states, with the exception of forced exercise ( Banzet et al., 2009 5. Banzet, S. ∙ Koulmann, N. ∙ Simler, N. ... Control of gluconeogenic genes during intense/prolonged exercise: hormone-independent effect of muscle-derived IL-6 on hepatic tissue and PEPCK mRNA J. Appl. Physiol. (1985). 2009; 107 :1830-1839 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this setting, IL-6 is derived from myocytes and induces hepatic gluconeogenesis. In our study, we did not observe any IL-6 induction in muscle, nor did we observe increased activity after stress, and instead found that brown adipocytes were indispensable in the setting of acute stress. It is interesting to speculate why IL-6, which can be derived from many different cell types, is produced by brown adipocytes in this context. The BAT has a number of features that make it an ideal endocrine organ responsive to acute psychologic stress. It is highly innervated, and thus capable of immediate responsiveness after detection of stress, a feature that has been clearly demonstrated in acute cold exposure for the purpose of defending body temperature. In addition, blood flow through BAT can be quickly increased (hyperemia) ( Abreu-Vieira et al., 2015 1. Abreu-Vieira, G. ∙ Hagberg, C.E. ∙ Spalding, K.L. ... Adrenergically stimulated blood flow in brown adipose tissue is not dependent on thermogenesis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 308 :E822-E829 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, in the setting of acute cold exposure, is optimal for quickly circulating warmed blood, or, in this case, a stress hormone. Interestingly, BAT hyperemia and thermogenesis can be decoupled, suggesting that there could be scenarios where uncoupled respiration is not necessary for hyperemia ( Abreu-Vieira et al., 2015 1. Abreu-Vieira, G. ∙ Hagberg, C.E. ∙ Spalding, K.L. ... Adrenergically stimulated blood flow in brown adipose tissue is not dependent on thermogenesis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 308 :E822-E829 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, we did not find that ambient temperature played a role in stress-inducible IL-6, observe transcriptional induction of the thermogenic program, find differences in body temperature as a function of IL-6 signaling, or demonstrate a requirement for UCP1. We speculate that perhaps through other contextual inputs, such as the cold-sensor TRPM8 ( Ma et al., 2012 50. Ma, S. ∙ Yu, H. ∙ Zhao, Z. ... Activation of the cold-sensing TRPM8 channel triggers UCP1-dependent thermogenesis and prevents obesity J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 4 :88-96 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moraes et al., 2017 57. Moraes, M.N. ∙ de Assis, L.V.M. ∙ Henriques, F.D.S. ... Cold-sensing TRPM8 channel participates in circadian control of the brown adipose tissue Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2017; 1864 :2415-2427 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), might be required to activate the full thermogenic program. From this perspective, BAT can thus be considered a stress-responsive endocrine organ that might have several responses depending on other contextual inputs. Finally, BAT is highly enriched in ADRB3. Unlike ADRB1 or ADRB2, ADRB3 has been shown to be less easily desensitized ( Rouget et al., 2004 79. Rouget, C. ∙ Breuiller-Fouché, M. ∙ Mercier, F.J. ... The human near-term myometrial beta 3-adrenoceptor but not the beta 2-adrenoceptor is resistant to desensitisation after sustained agonist stimulation Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141 :831-841 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus providing more durable responsiveness to adrenergic outflow. Consistent with this idea, we found that repeated stress-exposure over the course of 24 h maintained elevated plasma IL-6 levels. The role of BAT in adult humans is controversial because its detection is dependent upon the approach employed ( Leitner et al., 2017 45. Leitner, B.P. ∙ Huang, S. ∙ Brychta, R.J. ...

Cold-activated brown adipose tissue in healthy men N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360 :1500-1508 Crossref Scopus (2822) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is principally confined to clavicular and para-aortic areas, which might be why less stress-associated IL-6 is recovered in humans than in mice if it is even made in human BAT at all ( Maes et al., 1998 51. Maes, M. ∙ Song, C. ∙ Lin, A. ... The effects of psychological stress on humans: increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a Th1-like response in stress-induced anxiety Cytokine. 1998; 10 :313-318 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, recent work suggests that BAT of “humanized” mice is notably similar to human BAT ( de Jong et al., 2019 20. de Jong, J.M.A. ∙ Sun, W. ∙ Pires, N.D. ... Human brown adipose tissue is phenocopied by classical brown adipose tissue in physiologically humanized mice Nat. Metab. 2019; 1 :830-843 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains unclear how the mechanistic insights from our studies in rodents will translate to humans.
Our work further highlights the complexity of adrenergic signaling in physiology. Although signaling on ADRB2 in immune cells has largely been shown to be anti-inflammatory ( Ağaç et al., 2018 2. Ağaç, D. ∙ Estrada, L.D. ∙ Maples, R. ... The β2-adrenergic receptor controls inflammation by driving rapid IL-10 secretion Brain Behav. Immun. 2018; 74 :176-185 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nance and Sanders, 2007 59. Nance, D.M. ∙ Sanders, V.M. Autonomic innervation and regulation of the immune system (1987-2007) Brain Behav. Immun. 2007; 21 :736-745 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ), our study suggests that ADRB3 activation after acute stress exposure might be detrimental for adaptation to a subsequent inflammatory challenge. The clinical observation that sympathetic mimetics enhance survival in septic shock might be resultant from the effects of supraphysiological dosing on supporting blood pressure that might be the dominant mechanism of protection regardless of its other effects.
Like adrenergic biology, the role of IL-6 in inflammation and metabolism is similarly complex. IL-6 is generally considered a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is supported by the efficacy of IL-6 blockade in inflammatory diseases ( Kotch et al., 2019 43. Kotch, C. ∙ Barrett, D. ∙ Teachey, D.T. Tocilizumab for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome Expert Rev. Clin. Immunol. 2019; 15 :813-822 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, several studies demonstrate an anti-inflammatory role for IL-6 ( Mauer et al., 2014 54. Mauer, J. ∙ Chaurasia, B. ∙ Goldau, J. ... Signaling by IL-6 promotes alternative activation of macrophages to limit endotoxemia and obesity-associated resistance to insulin Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :423-430 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nandi et al., 2010 60. Nandi, D. ∙ Mishra, M.K. ∙ Basu, A. ... Protective effects of interleukin-6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced experimental endotoxemia are linked to alteration in hepatic anti-oxidant enzymes and endogenous cytokines Immunobiology. 2010; 215 :443-451 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, we demonstrate that BAT-derived IL-6 is required for stress to enhance end-organ damage and mortality caused by the LPS model. Likewise, we found that pre-exposure to peak plasma levels of stress-induced IL-6 was sufficient to increase end-organ damage and potentiate mortality. In the LPS model, which might not be generalizable to other models of inflammation, we found that although stress did not meaningfully increase inflammatory magnitude, hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary parameters, or gross metabolic parameters, it nonetheless led to measurable worsening of end-organ function and death. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear, but likely is a result of stress-induced IL-6-dependent metabolic re-programming similar to that which has been previously published by our group and others ( Ganeshan et al., 2019 29.

Whether other types of inflammatory challenges would also be affected by the models of acute stress used here, and, more generally, how different types, degrees, and durations of stress affect tissue tolerance in different inflammatory settings is an open question, as is the precise mechanism for how IL-6 primes LPS-mediated mortality. Moreover, it remains unclear if the elevated levels of circulating IL-6 seen in aging and obesity or after exercise would also drive differences in host tolerance to inflammation. Similarly, from a metabolic perspective, IL-6 has been shown to be both insulin sensitizing and insulin desensitizing depending on the context. In contexts of chronically increased IL-6 such as obesity or rheumatoid arthritis, IL-6 has been shown to induce insulin resistance ( Castañeda et al., 2019 14. Castañeda, S. ∙ Remuzgo-Martínez, S. ∙ López-Mejías, R. ...

On the other hand, in these same contexts, others have shown that IL-6 induces insulin sensitivity ( Carey et al., 2006 13. Carey, A.L. ∙ Steinberg, G.R. ∙ Macaulay, S.L. ...

IL-6 Improves Energy and Glucose Homeostasis in Obesity via Enhanced Central IL-6 trans-Signaling Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :267-280 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas IL-6 has been shown to be insulin sensitizing in exercise ( Benrick et al., 2012 7. Benrick, A. ∙ Wallenius, V. ∙ Asterholm, I.W. Interleukin-6 mediates exercise-induced increase in insulin sensitivity in mice Exp. Physiol. 2012; 97 :1224-1235 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study did not find that IL-6 was playing a role in insulin sensitivity after stress. Our animals were all lean, chow-fed animals, and thus in a net energy positive state. One main finding of our study is that IL-6 is a distinct inductive signal to instruct hepatic gluconeogenesis during net energy positive states. Unlike during fasting, ketogenic diets, or other hypoglycemic states where gluconeogenesis programs are mediated primarily by CREB/FoxO1 programs ( Oh et al., 2013 64. Oh, K.J. ∙ Han, H.S. ∙ Kim, M.J. ... CREB and FoxO1: two transcription factors for the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis BMB Rep. 2013; 46 :567-574 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ), which are responsive to low energy states, stress induces gluconeogenesis even in net positive energy balance states. Our data suggest that IL-6 signaling in hepatocytes is required for gluconeogenesis in non-net negative energy balance states. Although IL-6 does not appear to increase gluconeogenesis at rest ( Steensberg et al., 2003 86. Steensberg, A. ∙ Fischer, C.P. ∙ Sacchetti, M. ... Acute interleukin-6 administration does not impair muscle glucose uptake or whole-body glucose disposal in healthy humans J. Physiol. 2003; 548 :631-638 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), our studies resonate well with other studies demonstrating STAT3 regulation of the same gluconeogenic genes such as Pck1 and G6pc and with studies demonstrating a role for IL-6 in exercise-mediated hepatic gluconeogenesis ( Banzet et al., 2009 5. Banzet, S. ∙ Koulmann, N. ∙ Simler, N. ... Control of gluconeogenic genes during intense/prolonged exercise: hormone-independent effect of muscle-derived IL-6 on hepatic tissue and PEPCK mRNA J. Appl. Physiol. (1985). 2009; 107 :1830-1839 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, it is interesting to consider the similarities between psychological stress and forced exercise. Thus, we propose a model wherein IL-6 is a necessary signal that instructs gluconeogenesis in net energy positive states as an anticipatory, (impending increase in glucose demand), as opposed to responsive adaptation ( Figure 7 ).
We found that hepatic IL-6 signaling was required for a normal behavioral adaptation to stress. Numerous studies have reported that intracranial IL-6 and IL-6 signaling by using non-canonical trans -signaling modalities impact behavior ( Rothaug et al., 2016 78. Rothaug, M. ∙ Becker-Pauly, C. ∙ Rose-John, S. The role of interleukin-6 signaling in nervous tissue Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 :1218-1227 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings that hepatocyte expression of Il6ra is required for normal behavioral response to acute stress are in line with recent studies using chronic models of stress ( Hodes et al., 2014 33. Hodes, G.E. ∙ Pfau, M.L. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ... Individual differences in the peripheral immune system promote resilience versus susceptibility to social stress Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :16136-16141 Crossref Scopus (518) PubMed Google Scholar ; Niraula et al., 2019 63. Niraula, A. ∙ Witcher, K.G. ∙ Sheridan, J.F. ... Interleukin-6 Induced by Social Stress Promotes a Unique Transcriptional Signature in the Monocytes That Facilitate Anxiety Biol. Psychiatry. 2019; 85 :679-689 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 102. Zhang, J.C. ∙ Yao, W. ∙ Dong, C. ... Blockade of interleukin-6 receptor in the periphery promotes rapid and sustained antidepressant actions: a possible role of gut-microbiota-brain axis Transl. Psychiatry. 2017; 7 :e1138 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ), where the use of blocking antibodies to IL-6Ra, which do not cross the blood brain barrier ( Nellan et al., 2018 61. Nellan, A. ∙ McCully, C.M.L. ∙ Cruz Garcia, R. ... Improved CNS exposure to tocilizumab after cerebrospinal fluid compared to intravenous administration in rhesus macaques Blood. 2018; 132 :662-666 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ), promoted resilience to social stress. These studies suggest a necessary peripheral role for IL-6 in mediating behavioral changes, consistent with our findings. It is possible that hepatocyte IL-6Ra would be required in these models of chronic stress as well. Indeed, the light-dark box paradigm we utilized in this study is commonly used in depression and anxiety studies, and IL-6 has been implicated in depression for many years ( Kappelmann et al., 2018 35. Kappelmann, N. ∙ Lewis, G. ∙ Dantzer, R. ... Antidepressant activity of anti-cytokine treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials of chronic inflammatory conditions Mol. Psychiatry. 2018; 23 :335-343 Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, aerobic exercise, which also induces IL-6 ( Benrick et al., 2012 7. Benrick, A. ∙ Wallenius, V. ∙ Asterholm, I.W. Interleukin-6 mediates exercise-induced increase in insulin sensitivity in mice Exp. Physiol. 2012; 97 :1224-1235 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pedersen and Febbraio, 2008 69. Pedersen, B.K. ∙ Febbraio, M.A. Muscle as an endocrine organ: focus on muscle-derived interleukin-6 Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88 :1379-1406 Crossref Scopus (1630) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reza et al., 2017 77. Reza, M.M. ∙ Subramaniyam, N. ∙ Sim, C.M. ... Irisin is a pro-myogenic factor that induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy and rescues denervation-induced atrophy Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1104 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ), is highly associated with improved outcomes in depression and anxiety. Thus, it remains to be seen in on-going clinical trials (i.e., NCT02660528) if elevated IL-6 observed in depressed patients is pathogenic.
Our studies suggest that the degree of stress experienced by an animal at the time of inflammatory challenge might be one important factor for determining its disease trajectory. Understanding which environmental factors—such as timing to the last meal bolus or other determinants that are proxies for the “stressfulness” of the environment—might contribute to the stochasticity observed in genetically identical organisms subjected to identical challenges, which is an area of active study that might shed insight into mechanistic determinants of disease trajectories.
In summary, this study identifies a brain-BAT-liver axis in mice whereby IL-6 modulates glucose metabolism under conditions of acute stress and suggests that there is an adaptive purpose for inducing IL-6 in acute stress. We speculate that maladaptive states might arise in chronic stress where IL-6 becomes persistently elevated. Whether or not ADRB3 or IL-6Ra receptor biology changes as a function of chronic IL-6 states, as has been shown for the glucocorticoid and insulin receptors ( Boucher et al., 2014 11. Boucher, J. ∙ Kleinridders, A. ∙ Kahn, C.R. Insulin receptor signaling in normal and insulin-resistant states Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2014; 6 :a009191 Crossref Scopus (1021) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cohen et al., 2012 18. Cohen, S. ∙ Janicki-Deverts, D. ∙ Doyle, W.J. ... Chronic stress, glucocorticoid receptor resistance, inflammation, and disease risk Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :5995-5999 Crossref Scopus (893) PubMed Google Scholar ), remains to be seen. Should this brain-BAT-liver axis also be relevant in humans, our findings have implications for the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases such as seasonal affective disorder, where depression occurs primarily as a function of cold and dark seasons, and also implicate ADRB3 and IL-6 as potential therapeutic targets for preventing disease flares in conditions of pathologic inflammation.
These experiments were performed on mice in a single facility and largely on the C57BL/6J genetic background. The impact of the microbiota, genetic background, and facility-specific factors are unknown, and the unnatural settings in animal facilities likely affect the results and interpretation of physiology studies, including this one. It is likely that stress-induced IL-6 plays additional roles besides those described in our studies. There are a number of open questions raised by our study. Does psychological stress affect all types of inflammation the same? How do different stressors and degrees of stress affect inflammation? Are our observations informative for placebo and nocebo biology? Finally, the translatability of this study to humans is to be determined.

Male mice with 6-8 weeks of age were used. C57BL/6J, Adrb1/b2 KO, Ucp1 KO, Il6ra f/f, Alb Cre, Adipo Cre mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred at Yale University. Adrb3 KO mice were a kind gift from Dr. Natasa Petrovic (Stockholm University), Adrb3 f/f mice were a kind gift from Dr. Jean-Luc Balligand (UC Louvain), the Ucp1 CreER animal was a kind gift from Dr. Christian Wolfrum (ETH Zurich), the Il6 f/f mice were a kind gift from Dr. Juan Hidalgo (Universitat Autonoma Barecelona) and the Tlr2/4 KO, and Myd88/Trif KO animals were kindly provided by Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov. Adrenalectomy and sham surgery mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. All animal experiments were performed according to institutional regulations upon review and approval of Yale University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
For stress models, all experiments were done during the light period. Acute restraint stress was initiated by retaining a mouse in a ventilated 50ml Falcon tube for four hours. Social isolation was induced by individually housing mouse for three days. Retro-orbital bleeding (50 μL of blood drawn via a glass cuvette VWR #53432-921) was performed four hours before experiments, then blood was collected from the other eye for analysis. In the cage switch model, mice were removed from their home cage and placed in new cage of the same size with dirty bedding of other non-littermate males. Non-disturbed socially-housed littermates were applied as the controls. For anesthesia studies, ketamine/xylazine was injected intraperitoneally or animals were placed in isoflurane chambers. Verification of anesthesia was confirmed by lack of activity after toe pinching. Chemically sympathectomized with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, sigma) was applied through intraperitoneal injection 24 hours before acute stress at a dosage of 10 mg/kg. For manipulation of ambient temperature, mice were either housed at thermoneutral (32°C) cabinets for two weeks, or placed in the cold (4°C) for three hours, or housed at standard housing (22°C).
For flux and metabolite measurements, mice underwent surgery under isoflurane anesthesia to place a catheter in the left jugular vein. Animals were individually housed with unrestricted access to food and water and were treated again with IL-6Ra antibody or isotype control the night before a 120 min tracer infusion, performed after two hours of acclimation to a 1.25 inch diameter plastic restrainer (IBI Scientific) in which the mouse’s tail was drawn through the restraint and tethered with tape, while an adjustable nose cone permitted the mouse several centimeters of forward movement. At the conclusion of the tracer infusion, mice were euthanized via IV pentobarbital and liver and kidney were obtained and freeze-clamped in liquid N 2 within 30 s of euthanasia.
For LPS endotoxemia, mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS derived from Escherichia coli 055:B5 (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS. Dosing varies dramatically from lot to lot. New lots are tested for LD50. In these studies, lethal doses are between 15 and 20 mg/kg. For experiments with antibody blockade, anti-IL-6Ra or the isotype antibody (BE0047 and BE0090 respectively, Bio X Cell, 8 mg/kg) diluted in PBS was injected intravenously one night before experiment through retro-orbital injection. For experiments utilizing recombinant IL-6, recombinant mouse IL-6 (406-ML-025/CF, R&D) or PBS control was intravenously injected one hour before experiment at a dose of 5ng/100 μl/mouse through the retro-orbital plexus. For experiments utilizing adrenergic agonists, ADRB1/2 agonist (Isoproterenol, 1351005, Sigma-Aldrich, 1mg/kg), ADRB3 agonist (CL316243, Sigma-Aldrich, 1mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally two hours prior to blood and tissue harvesting. For adrenergic antagonists, propranolol (5 mg/kg, P0884, Sigma-Aldrich) and ADRB3 antagonist (SR59203A, 21407, Cayman Chemical, 5mg/kg) were applied once every two hours during four-hour-exposure of acute stresses, blood were collected at indicated time point, and lethal dose of LPS was administered two hours after last injection of ADRB3 antagonist.
Vital signs, including blood oxygen saturation, breath rate, and heart rate post LPS injection were monitored via pulse oximetry using the MouseOx Plus (Starr Life Sciences Corp.). Core body temperature was measured by rectal probe thermometry (Physitemp TH-5 Thermalert).
A community sample of individuals signed written informed consent for research approved by the Yale Institutional Review Board and was carefully assessed for high and low stress using a structured cumulative stress and adversity interview that assessed recent and past life events (Cumulative Adversity Interview (CAI)) ( Ansell et al., 2012 3. Ansell, E.B. ∙ Rando, K. ∙ Tuit, K. ... Cumulative adversity and smaller gray matter volume in medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and insula regions Biol.

Turner, R.J. ∙ Lloyd, D.A. Lifetime traumas and mental health: the significance of cumulative adversity J. Health Soc. Behav. 1995; 36 :360-376 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ). The high and low groups were group matched on age, gender, education and body mass index (BMI). All subjects participated in two standardized experiment sessions on consecutive days conducted between 2:00 and 4:00 pm in the afternoon. Baseline blood draws were drawn at 2 pm after a one-hour habituation period and two additional draws were conducted within 15 minutes. Change from baseline values were computed to assess baseline adjusted values and reduce variability across subjects.
Undiluted plasma from stressed mice were screened by Eve Technologies using mouse cytokine arrays, the raw data including standard results were presented in Figure S7 A. Except for the results in Figures 1 B and S1 E from samples analyzed by Eve Technologies, other analyses were conducted in our laboratory. Plasma concentrations of IL-6 were assayed by sandwich ELISA ( Luan et al., 2019 49. Luan, H.H. ∙ Wang, A. ∙ Hilliard, B.K. ...

Opposing Effects of Fasting Metabolism on Tissue Tolerance in Bacterial and Viral Inflammation Cell. 2016; 166 :1512-1525 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ). Anti-mouse IL-6 capture antibody (14-7061-85, eBioscience) was diluted (1:1000) in coating buffer (NaHPO4 PH 9) then incubated in enhanced protein-binding ELISA-grade plate (490012-252, VWR) overnight at 4°C. On the next day plates were blocked using PBS buffer with 10% FBS for one hour at room temperature. Afterward, the standards and plasma from stressed mice were incubated in the plate overnight at 4°C. The highest concentration of recombinant IL-6 standard (406-ML, R&D) was 10ng/ml followed by serial two-fold dilutions to create a standard curve, and plasma were diluted 1:5 (20ul plasma in 80ul blocking buffer per well). On the third day, biotin-conjugated anti-IL-6 detection antibodies (554402, BD PharMingen) was diluted (1:500) and incubated in the plate for one hour at room temperature, followed with another incubation of diluted (1:1000) HRP-conjugated streptavidin (554066, BD Biosciences) for half an hour at room temperature. Then plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature with TMB substrate reagent (555214, BD Biosciences) and the color was checked every five minutes. Then plates were read at 450nm instantly after stop solution (3M H 2 SO 4 ) was added. Between each step, five to seven times of washing were normally applied. The raw data, results of standard curve and representative plate with color developed with TMB were displayed in Figures S7 B–S7E. Plasma concentrations of TNFα and IL-1β were assayed by the same sandwich ELISA method. Recombinant TNFα (410-MY, R&D) and IL-1β (401-ML-010, R&D) were utilized as standards with the highest concentration at 10ng/ml and 1ng/ml respectively. Capture antibodies were anti-TNFα (14-7423-85, eBioscience) and anti-IL-1β (14-7012-81, Invitrogen). Detection antibodies conjugated with biotin were anti-mouse TNFα (13-7349-81, Invitrogen) and anti-mouse IL-1β (13-7112-85, eBioscience). HRP-conjugated streptavidin, TMB substrate reagent, and stop solution were the same with those in ELISA assay for IL-6 measurement.
Glycemia was measured by whole blood collection via the retro-orbital plexus and assessed using a glucometer (OneTouch), or, during the flux studies in IL-6Ra treated mice, in blood collected from the tail vein using the YSI Glucose Analyzer. Plasma was separated using lithium heparin-coated microcentrifuge tubes (BD Diagnostics). Plasma L-type triglycerides (TG) and nonesterified fatty acids were measured using the kits according to manufacturer’s instructions (Wako Diagnostics). Plasma Glycerol and β-hydroxybutyrate were measured using the kits per manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma Aldrich and Cayman Chemical, respectively). Plasma amino acid concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described previously ( Perry et al., 2018 73. Perry, R.J. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Cline, G.W. ... Leptin Mediates a Glucose-Fatty Acid Cycle to Maintain Glucose Homeostasis in Starvation Cell. 2018; 172 :234-248 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plasma levels of corticosterone (Enzo Life Sciences), insulin (Crystal Chem), and noradrenaline (Eagle Biosciences) were measured using kits according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Cardiac Troponin-I (CTNI) concentration and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) activity in the blood were measured by kits per manufacturers’ instructions (Life Diagnostics and Cayman Chemical, respectively). Plasma creatinine were assayed using HPLC by the George M. O’Brien Kidney Center at Yale.
Surgical removal of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was applied to seven weeks old male mice. A 1.5 cm incision was made to expose the intrascapular fat pads following intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine. Two lobes of darkly colored BAT were completely removed with little bleeding. Sham-operated mice were anesthetized and incisions were made into the muscles without tissue excision. Heat mats were applied to keep all animals warm during and after surgery until consciousness was fully recovered. Then mice were kept in room temperature, and IL-6 secretion post retro-orbital bleeding was analyzed in these mice two days after surgery.
For oral GTT, D-Glucose (G8270, Sigma-Aldrich) or water gavage was performed; blood was collected afterward through retro-orbital plexus at indicated time point for glucose and IL-6 analysis. For intraperitoneal GTT, D-glucose was given through intraperitoneal injection at the dose of 2g/kg. CBG was analyzed using a glucometer (OneTouch) at indicated time points. For insulin tolerance tests, insulin (Novolin R) was administrated at 2 IU/kg through intraperitoneal injection. For pyruvate tolerance tests, pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied at 2g/kg by intraperitoneal injection. CBG was analyzed at indicated time points. For lipid tolerance tests, intralipid 20% (1141, Sigma-Aldrich) was intraperitoneally injected at a volume of 200 μL per mouse. Plasma level of TG was analyzed at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after intralipid administration. For hepatic triglyceride production, poloxamer 407 (16758, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in PBS and then intraperitoneally injected at 1g/kg. Plasma level of TG was analyzed at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after poloxamer injection. Mice were fasted overnight before the hepatic TG production assay and assessment of glucose and palmitate turnover; for all other tolerance tests, stressed or unstressed mice were fasted for four hours before testing. Capillary blood glucose (CBG) was analyzed using a glucometer (OneTouch) at indicated time points.
After anti-IL-6Ra treatment, endogenous glucose production and palmitate turnover from C57BL/6J mice were measured as precious described ( Perry et al., 2017a 71. Perry, R.J. ∙ Peng, L. ∙ Abulizi, A. ... Mechanism for leptin’s acute insulin-independent effect to reverse diabetic ketoacidosis J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 :657-669 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017b 72. Perry, R.J. ∙ Peng, L. ∙ Cline, G.W. ... Non-invasive assessment of hepatic mitochondrial metabolism by positional isotopomer NMR tracer analysis (PINTA) Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :798 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, IL-6Ra inhibitor or vehicle control was injected through orbital venous plexus respectively before catheter placement and tracer infusions. Mice were infused with [3- 3 H] glucose (10 μCi/min, PerkinElmer), [U- 13 C 16 ] potassium palmitate (2.5 μmol/kg/min, Cambridge Isotopes), and [3- 13 C] sodium lactate (40 μmol/kg/min, Sigma) continuously for a total of two hours following a 5 min 3X prime. Palmitate turnover was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) ( Perry et al., 2017a 71. Perry, R.J. ∙ Peng, L. ∙ Abulizi, A. ... Mechanism for leptin’s acute insulin-independent effect to reverse diabetic ketoacidosis J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 :657-669 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plasma specific activity was measured using a scintillation counter and compared to tracer specific activity to measure whole-body endogenous glucose production, which can be attributed entirely to gluconeogenesis in a 16 hr fasted, glycogen-depleted mouse. Based on equations previously described ( Perry et al., 2017b 72. Perry, R.J. ∙ Peng, L. ∙ Cline, G.W. ... Non-invasive assessment of hepatic mitochondrial metabolism by positional isotopomer NMR tracer analysis (PINTA) Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :798 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), and after verifying minimal (atom percent enrichment < 1%, as compared to glucose 15%–20%) renal and hepatic bicarbonate enrichment, we measured the whole-body ratio of pyruvate carboxylase flux (i.e., gluconeogenesis from pyruvate) to total gluconeogenesis by mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA): 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 = [ 𝐶 2 ⁢ 1 3 ] ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑋 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐸 2 (1) where XFE represents the fractional triose enrichment and is calculated as 𝑋 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐸 = 1 1 + [ 𝐶 1 ⁢ 1 3 ] ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 2 ∗ [ 𝐶 2 ⁢ 1 3 ] ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 . (2) In these calculations, we corrected for any [ 13 C 2 ] glucose synthesized from [ 13 C 2 ] trioses – as opposed to the condensation of two [ 13 C 1 ] trioses – by GC-MS measurement of the enrichment in the glucose C4C5C6 fragment, according to the equation 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁡ [ 𝐶 2 ⁢ 1 3 ] ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 = 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁡ [ 𝐶 2 ⁢ 1 3 ] ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 − 2 ∗ [ 𝐶 ⁢ 4 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 5 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 6 − 𝐶 2 ⁢ 1 3 ] ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 (3) This ratio was measured in plasma (representing whole-body gluconeogenesis from pyruvate), liver, and renal cortex. By comparing the whole-body gluconeogenesis from pyruvate (GNG from pyruvate T ) to that measured in liver (GNG from pyruvate L ) and kidney (GNG from pyruvate K ), we were able to measure the fractional contribution of the kidney to whole-body gluconeogenesis ( 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 𝐾 / 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 ) : ( 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 𝐾 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 ) = 1 − 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑇 − 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 𝐾 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 𝐿 − 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 𝐾 (4) Absolute rates of gluconeogenesis from kidney could then be calculated by multiplying the measured endogenous glucose production by ( 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 𝐾 / 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐺 ) ( Equation 4 ), and gluconeogenesis from liver was calculated as the difference between total endogenous glucose production and gluconeogenesis from kidney. The rate of gluconeogenesis from liver and kidney was then multiplied by the fractional contribution of pyruvate to gluconeogenesis in those tissues to calculate the contribution of pyruvate to gluconeogenesis in each tissue.
Tissues were homogenized in 1ml RNA-Bee (Tel-Test, Inc) using a FastPrep-24 5G homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). RNA was purified using QIAGEN RNeasy columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated with reverse transcriptase (Clontech) using oligo-dT6 primers (Sigma-Aldrich). qRT-PCR was performed on a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) using PerfeCTa SYBR Green SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences). Relative expression units were calculated as transcript levels of target genes relative to Rpl13a . Primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S1 .
Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) were isolated by density separation as previously reported ( Aune et al., 2013 4. Aune, U.L. ∙ Ruiz, L. ∙ Kajimura, S. Isolation and differentiation of stromal vascular cells to beige/brite cells J. Vis. Exp. 2013; 50191 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, interscapular BAT depots were minced and digested in collagenase at 37°C for 1 hour with constant agitation. Then after filtering through 70 μM cell strainer, the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. The pellet was the SVF fraction.
Energy expenditure after acute stress was measured by indirect calorimetry using metabolic cages (Promethion, Sable Systems International). A 2-day period of acclimation was followed by 2 days of steady-state recording prior to experimentation. Afterward, C57BL/6J mice were given IL-6Ra antibody or isotype control through intravenous injection; the next morning, both groups were subjected to retro-orbital bleeding stress.
A blood pressure transducer (TA11-PA-C10, commercially available through Data Sciences International) was surgically implanted under isoflurane anesthesia (1%–3% in oxygen) into the carotid artery of mice using sterile surgical technique. Meloxicam was provided for 48 hours for post-operative analgesia and the skin was closed with surgical staples. Mice were allowed to recover for 7 days. Afterward, surgical staples were removed, and the mice were transferred to a fresh cage and singly housed for data collection. There they were allowed to acclimate for several days prior to initiation of study. A 10 s segment was collected every minute for the duration of the experiment. Every dot in the figure reflects the averaged value over one hour reading period.
The spontaneous exploratory behavior of mice following acute stress was analyzed three hours post retro-orbital bleeding using the light-dark paradigm. All experiments were performed between 11AM and 12 noon in male mice 6-8 weeks of age. Non-stressed mice were habituated to the environment three hours prior to being placed in the light/dark box; three days later, the same mice were transferred to the testing room one night before the experiment for acclimatization, then retro-orbital bleeding or tube restraint was performed three hours before light/dark box test. The light/dark box consisted of two of the same-sized chambers (18x10x13 cm), a dark chamber and an equal size light chamber connected by a small central aperture (3.8x3.8x3.8cm). Urine and feces were removed and the box was cleaned after each trial. Mice were initially placed in the corner of the light chamber facing away from the opening and monitored for 6 minutes after the first entry into the dark section. The latency time for the first passage from the light section to the dark one, transitions between the two compartments, and the amount of time spent in the dark were recorded ( Mineur et al., 2007 55. Mineur, Y.S. ∙ Somenzi, O. ∙ Picciotto, M.R. Cytisine, a partial agonist of high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has antidepressant-like properties in male C57BL/6J mice Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52 :1256-1262 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mice were euthanized and perfused with PBS or fixative. Brown adipose tissues were immersion-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Then tissues were trimmed, processed, embedded, and sectioned and stained for IL-6.
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). For parameters obtained from metabolic cage, the area under a curve was calculated followed by Student’s t test. Student’s t test was used for two groups comparison. More than two groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey test. Samples at different time points from multiple groups were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test. The log-rank Mantel-Cox test was used to compare Kaplan Meier curves. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001
