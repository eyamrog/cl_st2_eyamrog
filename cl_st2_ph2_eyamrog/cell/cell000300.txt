Title: Infection trains the host for microbiota-enhanced resistance to pathogens


Abstract: Summary

The microbiota shields the host against infections in a process known as colonization resistance. How infections themselves shape this fundamental process remains largely unknown. Here, we show that gut microbiota from previously infected hosts display enhanced resistance to infection. This long-term functional remodeling is associated with altered bile acid metabolism leading to the expansion of taxa that utilize the sulfonic acid taurine. Notably, supplying exogenous taurine alone is sufficient to induce this alteration in microbiota function and enhance resistance. Mechanistically, taurine potentiates the microbiota’s production of sulfide, an inhibitor of cellular respiration, which is key to host invasion by numerous pathogens. As such, pharmaceutical sequestration of sulfide perturbs the microbiota’s composition and promotes pathogen invasion. Together, this work reveals a process by which the host, triggered by infection, can deploy taurine as a nutrient to nourish and train the microbiota, promoting its resistance to subsequent infection.

Section: Introduction

The microbiota of host metaorganisms presents a formidable barrier to invasion by pathogens. Highlighting this, collateral damage to the microbiota by antibiotic therapy is often followed by the expansion of highly intractable antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Globally, antibiotic-resistant pathogens kill over 700,000 people per year, and over the next several decades, are expected to continue to represent a major cause of worldwide mortality ( United Nations Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, 2019 65. United Nations Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance No Time to Wait: Securing the future from drug-resistant infections 2019 https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/final-report/en/ Google Scholar ). For this reason, it is imperative to develop strategies to sustain or improve host antimicrobial defenses. One such arm of metaorganism immunity is colonization resistance, or the ability of the microbiota to resist pathogen colonization. Colonization resistance comprises via numerous inhibitory mechanisms that can be either direct or indirect/host mediated ( Kim et al., 2017 30. Kim, S. ∙ Covington, A. ∙ Pamer, E.G. The intestinal microbiota: Antibiotics, colonization resistance, and enteric pathogens Immunol. Rev. 2017; 279 :90-105 Crossref Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar ). The factors controlling colonization resistance, as well as the multiple mechanisms associated with this fundamental function, still remain to be fully explored.
A defining feature underlying the evolutionary success of the immune system is its ability to develop both innate and adaptive memory against pathogens, promoting more rapid and robust host responses to subsequent infections. Though memory was once exclusively attributed to the adaptive immune system, it is now appreciated that the innate immune system can also be trained to fully mature and attain enhanced function ( Netea et al., 2020 45. Netea, M.G. ∙ Domínguez-Andrés, J. ∙ Barreiro, L.B. ... Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :375-388 Crossref Scopus (1360) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, maturation of the adaptive and innate immune systems results not only through infections but, beginning in infancy, also through numerous other exposures such as diet and the microbiota ( Macpherson et al., 2017 38. Macpherson, A.J. ∙ de Agüero, M.G. ∙ Ganal-Vonarburg, S.C. How nutrition and the maternal microbiota shape the neonatal immune system Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :508-517 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether host memory of previous encounters reciprocally shapes the microbiota remains unclear.
The microbiota like the immune system is highly dynamic. Notably, age-associated shifts in the microbiota strongly influence the microbiota’s functional capacity and host fitness ( Stewart et al., 2018 63. Stewart, C.J. ∙ Ajami, N.J. ∙ O’Brien, J.L. ... Temporal development of the gut microbiome in early childhood from the TEDDY study Nature. 2018; 562 :583-588 Crossref Scopus (1138) PubMed Google Scholar ). A key example is that the immature microbiota of neonates is highly susceptible to pathogen invasion ( Singer et al., 2019 60. Singer, J.R. ∙ Blosser, E.G. ∙ Zindl, C.L. ... Preventing dysbiosis of the neonatal mouse intestinal microbiome protects against late-onset sepsis Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1772-1782 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Factors that modulate the development and maintenance of the microbiota include cross-talk with the immune system ( McLoughlin et al., 2016 42. McLoughlin, K. ∙ Schluter, J. ∙ Rakoff-Nahoum, S. ... Host Selection of Microbiota via Differential Adhesion Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :550-559 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ), antibiotic exposure ( Roubaud-Baudron et al., 2019 57. Roubaud-Baudron, C. ∙ Ruiz, V.E. ∙ Swan, Jr., A.M. ... Long-term effects of early-life antibiotic exposure on resistance to subsequent bacterial infection MBio. 2019; 10 :e02820 e19 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), and defined dietary components ( Wotzka et al., 2019 69. Wotzka, S.Y. ∙ Kreuzer, M. ∙ Maier, L. ... Escherichia coli limits Salmonella Typhimurium infections after diet shifts and fat-mediated microbiota perturbation in mice Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2164-2174 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Increasingly appreciated is also the role of pathogens in remodeling the microbiota ( Kamdar et al., 2016 29. Kamdar, K. ∙ Khakpour, S. ∙ Chen, J. ...

Intraluminal containment of commensal outgrowth in the gut during infection-induced dysbiosis Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14 :318-328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). For instance, by eliciting an overly exuberant immune response, pathogens can gain access to inflammatory byproducts, such as elevated oxygen in normally anaerobic niches, that enable utilization of non-fermentable, strictly respiratory substrates for growth ( Lopez et al., 2016 36. Lopez, C.A. ∙ Miller, B.M. ∙ Rivera-Chávez, F. ... Virulence factors enhance Citrobacter rodentium expansion through aerobic respiration Science. 2016; 353 :1249-1253 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Due to the prevalence of infections throughout evolution, we hypothesize that host metaorganisms have adapted strategies to harness infection-elicited microbiota for their own benefit and greater defense against subsequent infection. A corollary of this hypothesis is that regular exposure to pathogens may be beneficial for the microbiota to develop optimal antimicrobial function. In industrialized societies, however, improved hygiene and sanitation is thought to have reduced exposure to certain classes of pathogens, contributing to a recent precipitous decline in microbiota diversity and beneficial functions ( Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2019 61.

Helminth infection promotes colonization resistance via type 2 immunity Science. 2016; 352 :608-612 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aligning with this, studies with the microbiota of wild and pet-shop mice ( Beura et al., 2016 4. Beura, L.K. ∙ Hamilton, S.E. ∙ Bi, K. ...

Laboratory mice born to wild mice have natural microbiota and model human immune responses Science. 2019; 365 :eaaw4361 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ), which inevitably encounter more infections than their laboratory counterparts, have demonstrated that mice with a history of infection exhibit altered immunity ( Reese et al., 2016 52.

Here, we examined the possibility that prior infections could enhance metaorganism colonization resistance and that dissecting the underlying molecular mechanism would lead to the identification of novel microbiota-directed therapeutics. Our results uncover that the host, triggered by transient infection, deploys the sulfonic acid taurine as a nutrient to promote long-term resistance of the microbiota to subsequent infection.

Section: Results

To assess the impact of infection on the ability of the microbiota to promote colonization resistance, we first sought a model pathogen whose colonization of the host is dictated primarily by the microbiota. We therefore chose the hospital-associated pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae ( Kpn ) ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019 11. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 2019 Crossref Google Scholar ), specifically a derivative of a carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate ( Ramage et al., 2017 49. Ramage, B. ∙ Erolin, R. ∙ Held, K. ... Comprehensive arrayed transposon mutant library of Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak strain KPNIH1 J. Bacteriol. 2017; 199 :e00352 e17 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Though extraintestinal infections with Kpn can be life threatening, otherwise healthy individuals can harbor Kpn at low levels in their gut microbiota, and hospitalized patients colonized with Kpn are at much greater risk for subsequent systemic infection ( Conlan et al., 2016 13. Conlan, S. ∙ Park, M. ∙ Deming, C. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Plasmid dynamics in KPC-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae during long-term patient colonization MBio. 2016; 7 :e00742 e16 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gorrie et al., 2017 22. Gorrie, C.L. ∙ Mirčeta, M. ∙ Wick, R.R. ... Gastrointestinal carriage is a major reservoir of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in intensive care patients Clin. Infect. Dis. 2017; 65 :208-215 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mice, following oral infection with a high dose, Kpn can be transiently detected in the lumen of the large intestine before it is no longer detectable in the stool by 2 days post-infection ( Figures 1 A and 1B). In contrast, mice orally pre-treated with streptomycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, sustain a high fecal burden of Kpn ( Figure 1 B). These results support the idea that the microbiota plays a dominant role in controlling Kpn colonization, making this pathogen suitable for our studies of microbiota-dependent colonization resistance.
To examine how prior infection impacts resistance to Kpn , we employed 2 separate mouse models: (1) the offspring of a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mouse colony whose germ-free (GF) founders received the microbiota of wild mice (wildR model) ( Rosshart et al., 2017 55. Rosshart, S.P. ∙ Vassallo, B.G. ∙ Angeletti, D. ... Wild Mouse Gut Microbiota Promotes Host Fitness and Improves Disease Resistance Cell. 2017; 171 :1015-1028.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ) and (2) SPF mice previously infected with an attenuated strain ( ΔyopM ) of the food-borne pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (post- ΔyopM model) ( Han et al., 2017 24. Han, S.J. ∙ Glatman Zaretsky, A. ∙ Andrade-Oliveira, V. ... White adipose tissue is a reservoir for memory T cells and promotes protective memory responses to infection Immunity. 2017; 47 :1154-1168.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 C). The first model is particularly appropriate for addressing our question since, in their natural environment, wild mice are exposed to far more infections than standard laboratory mice. We acknowledge, however, that many factors besides prior infection could also contribute to the altered microbiota of wild mice. Hence, we also turned to the more defined post- ΔyopM model. A key advantage of this model is that ΔyopM locally expands and induces gut inflammation but, unlike the Y. pseudotuberculosis ( Yptb ) wild-type, is completely cleared within a few days post-infection ( Han et al., 2017 24. Han, S.J. ∙ Glatman Zaretsky, A. ∙ Andrade-Oliveira, V. ... White adipose tissue is a reservoir for memory T cells and promotes protective memory responses to infection Immunity. 2017; 47 :1154-1168.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, this model allowed us to assess the impact of a transient infectious process on colonization resistance, independently of pathogen persistence.
Following oral infection, wildR mice displayed enhanced resistance to Kpn as compared to control SPF mice ( Figure 1 D). Because wildR mice were generated by transferring the microbiota of wild mice into GF mice ( Figure 1 C), these results support the idea that the enhanced resistance of wildR mice was primarily mediated by the microbiota. Furthermore, we also observed enhanced resistance to Kpn in mice previously infected with ΔyopM ( Figure 1 E). A time course of resistance to Kpn following ΔyopM infection showed that enhanced resistance is detectable only after 4 weeks post- ΔyopM infection and persists to at least 15 weeks post- ΔyopM infection ( Figures 1 E and S1 A).
To distinguish the role of the microbiota versus host responses in ΔyopM -enhanced resistance, we first considered the possibility that prior infection may accelerate intestinal expulsion. However, intestinal transit time was not impacted following ΔyopM infection ( Figure S1 B). Next, we broadly surveyed both innate and adaptive immune responses in the lamina propria of the large intestines ( Figures S2 A–S2C), the primary site of Kpn colonization ( Figure 1 A). The most significant immune alteration that we identified was that, in mice at 4 weeks post- ΔyopM infection, CD8 + T cells exhibit a heightened potential to produce the cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ ( Figures S2 C and S2D). Thus, ΔyopM -enhanced resistance could result from altered mucosal immune responses and/or changes to the microbiota. While both phenomena could play a role, we decided to focus our exploration on the microbiota.
To this end, we conventionalized GF mice with fecal microbiota from post- ΔyopM mice or control naive mice ( Figure 1 C). As previously reported ( Han et al., 2017 24. Han, S.J. ∙ Glatman Zaretsky, A. ∙ Andrade-Oliveira, V. ... White adipose tissue is a reservoir for memory T cells and promotes protective memory responses to infection Immunity. 2017; 47 :1154-1168.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ), we could not detect ΔyopM in the transferred microbiota ( Figure S1 C). Using this approach, we found that the microbiota from post- ΔyopM mice was sufficient to confer enhanced resistance to Kpn ( Figure 1 F). Notably, resistance resulting from microbiota transfer occurred in the absence of enhanced CD8 + T cell responses ( Figure S2 E). These findings illustrate that a single mild infection is sufficient to remodel the microbiota in a way that enhances resistance to Kpn .
We next analyzed the community compositions of the post- ΔyopM and wildR microbiota, with the goal of identifying commonly enriched taxa that may enhance colonization resistance. Thus, we examined the 16S rRNA gene profiles of the wildR microbiota (F2 generation from a previously published study [ Rosshart et al., 2017 55. Rosshart, S.P. ∙ Vassallo, B.G. ∙ Angeletti, D. ... Wild Mouse Gut Microbiota Promotes Host Fitness and Improves Disease Resistance Cell. 2017; 171 :1015-1028.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ]) and the post- ΔyopM microbiota. Unlike the post- ΔyopM microbiota (which was compared to naive SPF microbiota as a control), the wildR microbiota exhibited higher alpha diversity compared to its control (microbiota of F2 labR mice, or mice whose GF founders received the microbiota of laboratory mice [ Rosshart et al., 2017 55. Rosshart, S.P. ∙ Vassallo, B.G. ∙ Angeletti, D. ... Wild Mouse Gut Microbiota Promotes Host Fitness and Improves Disease Resistance Cell. 2017; 171 :1015-1028.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ]) ( Figure S1 D). On the other hand, both wildR and post- ΔyopM microbiota profiles clustered separately from their controls according to beta diversity analyses ( Figures 1 G and 1H), and this separation persisted to the F10 (contemporary) generation of wildR mice and was maintained after transfer of the post- ΔyopM microbiota into GF mice ( Figures S1 E and S1F).
While we did not discern consistent major shifts in highly abundant phyla ( Figures S1 G an S1H), a normally minor phylum, Proteobacteria , was the only phylum to be enriched in both the post- ΔyopM and wildR microbiota (both F2 and F10 generations) ( Figure S1 H; Table S1 ), expanding about 100-fold from 0.01% to 1% following infection with ΔyopM and in wildR mice compared to control mice ( Figure 1 I). Several members of the Proteobacteria phylum, especially those within the class Gammaproteobacteria , are known to expand in the context of infection and inflammation ( Molloy et al., 2013 43. Molloy, M.J. ∙ Grainger, J.R. ∙ Bouladoux, N. ... Intraluminal containment of commensal outgrowth in the gut during infection-induced dysbiosis Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14 :318-328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in our settings, the only Proteobacteria classes to be significantly increased in both the post- ΔyopM and wildR microbiota (F2 and F10), as compared to their control microbiota, were the Deltaproteobacteria and the Betaproteobacteria ( Figures 1 J and S1 I). Furthermore, following transfer of the post- ΔyopM microbiota into GF mice, the only Proteobacteria species to remain enriched was a deltaproteobacterium ( Figure S1 J; Table S1 ). Thus, microbiota profiles associated with enhanced resistance to Kpn are enriched for Deltaproteobacteria , supporting the idea that these bacteria may promote colonization resistance.
Due to the enrichment of Proteobacteria in both the post- ΔyopM and wildR microbiota, we hypothesized that they may harbor common community functions. To probe this possibility, we examined the shotgun metagenomes of the wildR (F2 generation) and post- ΔyopM microbiota. Relative to its control metagenome, the post- ΔyopM metagenome was enriched for 46 functions, while the wildR metagenome was enriched for 379 functions (Enzyme Commission numbers [ McDonald et al., 2009 41. McDonald, A.G. ∙ Boyce, S. ∙ Tipton, K.F. ExplorEnz: the primary source of the IUBMB enzyme list Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :D593-D597 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ]) ( Figure 2 A; Table S2 ). Of these enriched functions, 18 were shared ( Figure 2 B), and 6 of these 18 could be assigned to 2 metabolic pathways: sulfur metabolism and menaquinone biosynthesis ( Figures 2 C and 2D).
In agreement with the expansion of Deltaproteobacteria in the post- ΔyopM and wildR microbiota ( Figure 1 J), the primary source of the sulfur metabolism pathway was a deltaproteobacterium ( Desulfovibrio genus) in the post- ΔyopM metagenome (blue wedges, Figure 2 D) and a mixture of Deltaproteobacteria in the wildR metagenome (blue wedges, Figure S3 A). A prevalent characteristic of Deltaproteobacteria is the ability to gain energy from anaerobic respiration with sulfur-containing compounds such as taurine or sulfate ( Peck et al., 2019 48. Peck, S.C. ∙ Denger, K. ∙ Burrichter, A. ... A glycyl radical enzyme enables hydrogen sulfide production by the human intestinal bacterium Bilophila wadsworthia Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :3171-3176 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 E). Specifically, these bacteria first convert taurine or sulfate to sulfite via taurine-pyruvate aminotransferase (encoded by tpa ) or sulfate adenylyltransferase ( sat ), respectively. Then, they reduce sulfite to sulfide via dissimilatory sulfite reductase ( dsr ) using electrons donated by menaquinone electron shuttles ( Barton et al., 2017 3. Barton, L.L. ∙ Ritz, N.L. ∙ Fauque, G.D. ... Sulfur cycling and the intestinal microbiome Dig. Dis. Sci. 2017; 62 :2241-2257 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 E). To distinguish whether taurine and/or sulfate drives the Deltaproteobacteria expansion in the post- ΔyopM and wildR microbiota, we assessed the abundance of tpa and sat in their metagenomes. While tpa was significantly higher in both metagenomes, sat showed a modest increase in only the wildR metagenome, suggesting that taurine rather than sulfate contributes to the expansion of Deltaproteobacteria ( Figure 2 C).
Because metagenomics can only give insight into the microbiota’s functional potential, we next set out to more directly determine whether taurine is indeed elevated in the gut following infection. To this end, we profiled the abundance of 186 defined metabolites using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and in total identified 13 metabolites that were more abundant in the cecal contents of post- ΔyopM mice than those of control mice ( Figures 2 F and S3 B; Table S3 ). Five of these 13 metabolites were the substrate, precursors, or byproducts of xanthine oxidase (metabolites in bold in Figure S3 B), a host antimicrobial effector known to be induced by enteric pathogens ( Martin et al., 2004 40. Martin, H.M. ∙ Hancock, J.T. ∙ Salisbury, V. ... Role of xanthine oxidoreductase as an antimicrobial agent Infect. Immun. 2004; 72 :4933-4939 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably and confirming our metagenomics-based prediction, taurine was the most significantly increased metabolite in post- ΔyopM mice ( Figures 2 F and S3 B).
In the gut, a dominant source of taurine is bile acids ( Wahlström et al., 2016 67. Wahlström, A. ∙ Sayin, S.I. ∙ Marschall, H.U. ... Intestinal Crosstalk between Bile Acids and Microbiota and Its Impact on Host Metabolism Cell Metab. 2016; 24 :41-50 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1756) PubMed Google Scholar ). These host detergents are synthesized and conjugated to taurine in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and released into the gut to aid fat/oil digestion ( Figure 2 G). Once in the gut, bile acids are chemically transformed by specific members of the microbiota. These transformations include deconjugation, which releases taurine from primary (host-synthesized) bile acids, making taurine bioavailable to the entire microbiota, and dehydroxylation into secondary (microbiota-derived) bile acids ( Wahlström et al., 2016 67. Wahlström, A. ∙ Sayin, S.I. ∙ Marschall, H.U. ... Intestinal Crosstalk between Bile Acids and Microbiota and Its Impact on Host Metabolism Cell Metab. 2016; 24 :41-50 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1756) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 G). The latter activity is encoded by the bai operon, and a gene within this operon ( baiE ) was jointly enriched in the post- ΔyopM and wildR metagenomes, suggesting heightened bile-acid-directed activity in the gut microbiota of these mice ( Figure 2 C).
Because bile acids are synthesized in the liver, we assessed this organ for broad changes post-infection. Post- ΔyopM mice, however, did not exhibit gross signs of liver damage based on histology ( Figures S3 D and S3E). On the other hand, whole-tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of post- ΔyopM livers revealed differential expression of 894 genes. The 792 upregulated genes were functionally enriched for pathways (Gene Ontology terms [ Ashburner et al., 2000 1. Ashburner, M. ∙ Ball, C.A. ∙ Blake, J.A. ..., The Gene Ontology Consortium Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :25-29 Crossref Scopus (30809) PubMed Google Scholar ]) related to inflammation, cytokine production, and leukocyte activity ( Figure S3 F; Table S4 ). In line with this, post- ΔyopM liver-derived γδ, CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells exhibited heightened production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines ( Figure S3 G). Although these cytokines, in particular interleukin-17 (IL-17), are associated with bile-acid-induced inflammation ( Li et al., 2017 34. Li, M. ∙ Cai, S.-Y. ∙ Boyer, J.L. Mechanisms of bile acid mediated inflammation in the liver Mol. Aspects Med. 2017; 56 :45-53 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ), only 3 genes ( Vdr , Slc10a6 , Slco1a1 ) mediating bile acid signaling/transport were differentially expressed in post- ΔyopM livers, suggesting that most ΔyopM -induced changes to bile acid metabolism may occur post-transcriptionally or outside the liver. Supporting this, post- ΔyopM mice sustained enlarged gallbladders ( Figure S3 H) and higher intestinal levels of total bile acids ( Figure S3 I). Thus, a transient infection can induce long-term heightened immunity within the liver, the organ responsible for synthesizing bile acids, along with alterations to the gallbladder, the organ responsible for storing bile acids. Of interest, wildR mice also sustained higher intestinal levels of total bile acids ( Figure S3 J) but lower levels of taurine, a potential result of enhanced consumption by the microbiota ( Figure S3 C).
Because bile acids are highly heterogeneous, we next profiled the abundance of 23 defined bile acids using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total taurine-conjugated bile acids as well as individual primary and secondary bile acids were elevated in the cecal contents of post- ΔyopM mice ( Figures 2 H and S3 K; Table S3 ). Collectively, these results propose that even a transient infectious encounter can have long-term consequences on host bile acid metabolism, resulting in a sustained increase in intestinal taurine, a phenomenon that may lead to the expansion of taurine-utilizing Deltaproteobacteria ( Figure 2 K).
To assess whether taurine-utilizing Deltaproteobacteria contribute to colonization resistance, we chose the deltaproteobacterium Bilophila wadsworthia ATCC 49260 as a model. As predicted for the Deltaproteobacteria in the post- ΔyopM and wildR metagenomes ( Figure 2 C), this strain flourishes on taurine, but not sulfate ( Figure 2 I), in a menaquinone-dependent manner ( Figure S3 L). To preferentially enrich the gut microbiota with B. wadsworthia , we colonized GF mice with mono-cultures of B. wadsworthia prior to conventionalizing these mice with complex SPF microbiota. This procedure resulted in a nearly 8-fold increase in B. wadsworthia ( Figure S3 M; Table S1 ) and was sufficient to enhance resistance to Kpn ( Figure 2 J). Together, these results support the idea that the expansion of taurine-utilizing Deltaproteobacteria can directly contribute to colonization resistance ( Figure 2 K).
Our results thus far support the idea that elevated taurine may by itself promote colonization resistance. To test this, we placed mice onto taurine-supplemented drinking water for 2–3 weeks prior to infection with Kpn ( Figure 3 A). Fecal measurements showed that this procedure was able to slightly increase the available taurine in the distal colon without altering total bile acids ( Figure 3 B). Notably, even a slight increase in colonic taurine levels was sufficient to increase resistance to Kpn ( Figure 3 C). Suggesting a role for the gut microbiota, taurine supplementation did not enhance intestinal expulsion or resistance to Kpn airway infection ( Figures S4 A–S4C).
Besides serving as a microbial nutrient, taurine has been shown to stimulate host antimicrobial defenses ( Levy et al., 2015 32. Levy, M. ∙ Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Zeevi, D. ... Microbiota-Modulated Metabolites Shape the Intestinal Microenvironment by Regulating NLRP6 Inflammasome Signaling Cell. 2015; 163 :1428-1443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). To distinguish whether the microbiota or host primarily mediates taurine-enhanced resistance, we first assessed immune cell composition in the large intestinal lamina propria and epithelium via flow cytometry and RNA-seq, respectively. These approaches revealed that taurine alone elicits neither innate nor adaptive immune responses in the lamina propria and only modestly alters gene expression in purified epithelial cells (all log 2 fold changes <0.5, Figures S4 D–S4F; Table S4 ). Interestingly, nearly half (10/21) of the upregulated genes encoded ribosomal proteins, suggesting that taurine primarily stimulates epithelial cell growth and translation rather than antimicrobial defense. Next, we assessed whether taurine can enhance resistance to Kpn in mice devoid of microbiota ( Figure S4 G). However, taurine treatment of GF mice did not alter protection ( Figure S4 H). While less powered than our SPF experiments ( Figure 3 C), our GF experiments nevertheless suggest that, under certain settings, the microbiota may be required for taurine-enhanced resistance. To confirm this, we transferred the fecal microbiota of taurine or vehicle-treated mice into GF mice. Further supporting a role for the microbiota, the taurine-trained microbiota promoted greater resistance to Kpn ( Figure 3 D).
To determine whether taurine can enhance resistance to other pathogens, we utilized Citrobacter rodentium , a murine model for pathogenic E. coli ( Figure S4 I). C. rodentium primarily colonizes the colon, where one of its virulence strategies is to induce the hyperplasia of colonic crypts. Because epithelial colonocytes represent a major source of oxygen in the colon lumen, crypt hyperplasia promotes C. rodentium aerobic respiration and luminal proliferation ( Lopez et al., 2016 36. Lopez, C.A. ∙ Miller, B.M. ∙ Rivera-Chávez, F. ... Virulence factors enhance Citrobacter rodentium expansion through aerobic respiration Science. 2016; 353 :1249-1253 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Beginning at day 3 post-infection, taurine induced a 1 to 3 log decrease in C. rodentium fecal burden ( Figures 3 E and S4 J) and was also able to mitigate crypt hyperplasia ( Figures S4 K and S4L). Thus, these results further demonstrate taurine’s ability to enhance colonization resistance.
We next assessed the impact of taurine on gut microbial ecology. Because pathways for metabolizing taurine are taxonomically widespread ( Cook and Denger, 2006 14. Cook, A.M. ∙ Denger, K. Metabolism of taurine in microorganisms: A primer in molecular biodiversity? Oja, S.S. ∙ Saransaari, P. (Editors) Taurine 6, Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology Springer, Boston, MA, Volume 583. 2006; 3-13 Google Scholar ), we predicted that diverse taxa would have the potential to benefit and expand in response to taurine. In line with this, 16S profiling revealed that taurine remodeling of the gut microbiota is highly variable at the taxonomic level ( Figure 3 F; Table S1 ). This remodeling, however, was conserved at the functional level, as revealed by shotgun metagenomics, where one of the largest increases was in the gene encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase ( dsr ) ( Figure 3 G; Table S2 ). The dsr gene product catalyzes the final step in taurine metabolism ( Figure 2 E), and, consistent with taurine shaping the post- ΔyopM and wildR microbiota, both of their metagenomes were also enriched for dsr ( Figure 2 C). In the taurine-trained metagenome, the primary sources of dsr were Clostridiales ( Figure 3 H), and accordingly, many Clostridiales also expanded following taurine treatment ( Figure 3 F). Of note, these taxa were distinct from the primary source of dsr ( Deltaproteobacteria ) in the post- ΔyopM and wildR microbiota ( Figures 2 D and S3 A). Thus, both taurine supplementation and prior infection enrich for members of the microbiota that functionally share the capacity for metabolizing taurine via dsr .
A major byproduct of taurine metabolism, resulting directly from dsr activity, is the poisonous gas hydrogen sulfide ( Barton et al., 2017 3. Barton, L.L. ∙ Ritz, N.L. ∙ Fauque, G.D. ... Sulfur cycling and the intestinal microbiome Dig. Dis. Sci. 2017; 62 :2241-2257 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our metagenomics data ( Figure 3 G), we predicted that the taurine-trained microbiota would produce more sulfide than vehicle-treated microbiota. To test this, we utilized an ex vivo culture-based approach, allowing us to modulate the microbiota’s growth environment. Confirming our metagenomics-based prediction, the microbiota of taurine-treated mice was highly responsive to taurine addition ex vivo , producing significantly more sulfide than the microbiota of vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 3 I). Together, these data support the idea that training of the microbiota with taurine, a bile-acid-derived metabolite that is elevated by pathogenic exposures, potentiates the microbiota’s ability to produce sulfide ( Figure 3 J).
At high concentrations, hydrogen sulfide can inhibit the activity of cytochrome oxidases, the terminal enzymes in aerobic electron transport chains ( Forte et al., 2016 19. Forte, E. ∙ Borisov, V.B. ∙ Falabella, M. ... The terminal oxidase cytochrome bd promotes sulfide-resistant bacterial respiration and growth Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :23788 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because aerobic respiration is exploited by pathogens to access non-fermentable growth substrates ( Lopez et al., 2016 36. Lopez, C.A. ∙ Miller, B.M. ∙ Rivera-Chávez, F. ... Virulence factors enhance Citrobacter rodentium expansion through aerobic respiration Science. 2016; 353 :1249-1253 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ) and because taurine potentiates sulfide production by the microbiota ( Figure 3 I), we proposed the following model for taurine-enhanced colonization resistance: at low levels of taurine, oxygen enables pathogens to access non-fermentable substrates, whereas at high levels of taurine (such as in post- ΔyopM or taurine-supplemented mice), taurine-derived sulfide restricts pathogens from these substrates ( Figure 4 A).
To test our model, we initially employed a high-throughput approach, transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) ( Chao et al., 2016 12. Chao, M.C. ∙ Abel, S. ∙ Davis, B.M. ... The design and analysis of transposon insertion sequencing experiments Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :119-128 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ), to screen Kpn Tn mutants with altered fitness in vivo . To perform Tn-seq, we passaged an input pool of 12,000 Kpn Tn mutants through control and post- ΔyopM mice ( Ramage et al., 2017 49. Ramage, B. ∙ Erolin, R. ∙ Held, K. ... Comprehensive arrayed transposon mutant library of Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak strain KPNIH1 J. Bacteriol. 2017; 199 :e00352 e17 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). With this experimental design, if a particular gene preferentially promoted fitness in 1 of the 2 mouse groups, mutants in that gene would be preferentially depleted from that group’s output pool ( Figure S5 A). To identify such mutants, we amplified and deep-sequenced Kpn genomic DNA adjacent to Tn insertions, allowing us to determine both their genomic location and abundance in the output pools. In total, we identified 125 and 79 genes that differentially promote Kpn fitness in control and post- ΔyopM mice, respectively ( Table S5 ).
Based on our model ( Figure 4 A), we first queried our Tn-seq results for Kpn genes that mediate anaerobic respiration. In bacteria, respiration can be performed not only with oxygen but also anaerobic electron acceptors, such as nitrate. While defined enteric pathogens have been demonstrated to exploit anaerobic respiration to colonize the gut ( Faber et al., 2017 17. Faber, F. ∙ Thiennimitr, P. ∙ Spiga, L. ... Respiration of microbiota-derived 1,2-propanediol drives Salmonella expansion during colitis PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006129 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ), our model proposes that taurine-derived sulfide specifically inhibits aerobic respiration. Accordingly, Tn-seq confirmed the inability of genes that mediate anaerobic respiration to differentially contribute to Kpn fitness in either control or post- ΔyopM mice ( Figure S5 B).
We next queried our Tn-seq results for Kpn genes that mediate growth on non-fermentable substrates. Based on our model, we focused on substrates, such as formate ( Lopez et al., 2016 36. Lopez, C.A. ∙ Miller, B.M. ∙ Rivera-Chávez, F. ... Virulence factors enhance Citrobacter rodentium expansion through aerobic respiration Science. 2016; 353 :1249-1253 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ), that gut pathogens have been reported to exploit in vivo via aerobic respiration ( Figure S5 B). Among the genes that we examined, most striking was that 4 of the 21 genes in the 1,2-propanediol utilization ( pdu ) locus promoted Kpn fitness in control rather than post- ΔyopM mice (enrichment p = 0.003, hypergeometric test) ( Figures 4 B and S5 B). 1,2-propanediol is a byproduct of fermentation by the microbiota, but, being strictly respiratory, it itself can only be utilized in the presence of an electron acceptor ( Faber et al., 2017 17. Faber, F. ∙ Thiennimitr, P. ∙ Spiga, L. ... Respiration of microbiota-derived 1,2-propanediol drives Salmonella expansion during colitis PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006129 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). While anaerobic electron acceptors could fuel Kpn growth on 1,2-propanediol, we found that Kpn grew maximally on 1,2-propanediol with oxygen ( Figure 4 C).
Based on this finding, we next queried our Tn-seq results for terminal oxidases that potentially support Kpn growth on 1,2-propanediol in vivo . Indeed, Tn-seq identified a putative oxidase that, like the pdu locus, contributed to Kpn fitness in control mice ( Figure S5 B). The gene encoding this oxidase was homologous (>68% identical in amino acid sequence) to the cyxB -encoded subunit of the Salmonella cytochrome oxidase bd -II ( Rivera-Chávez et al., 2016 53. Rivera-Chávez, F. ∙ Zhang, L.F. ∙ Faber, F. ... Depletion of Butyrate-Producing Clostridia from the Gut Microbiota Drives an Aerobic Luminal Expansion of Salmonella Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :443-454 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ). To confirm that Kpn cyxB promotes 1,2-propanediol utilization, we competed the wild-type (WT) against a cyxB − mutant in minimal media with 1,2-propanediol as the sole carbon source. At the level of oxygen in air (21%), the cyxB − mutant exhibited fitness comparable to the WT ( Figure 4 D). On the other hand, at levels of oxygen comparable to those found in the gut (<1%) ( Rivera-Chávez et al., 2016 53. Rivera-Chávez, F. ∙ Zhang, L.F. ∙ Faber, F. ... Depletion of Butyrate-Producing Clostridia from the Gut Microbiota Drives an Aerobic Luminal Expansion of Salmonella Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :443-454 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ), the Kpn WT robustly outcompeted the mutant ( Figure 4 D). Collectively, these data support the idea that Kpn utilizes 1,2-propanediol in vivo by scavenging oxygen via cytochrome oxidase bd -II.
As a further test of our model ( Figure 4 A), we next assessed whether sulfide could directly block 1,2-propanediol utilization. Indeed, >250 μM sulfide potently inhibited the ability of Kpn to grow on 1,2-propanediol with oxygen ( Figure 4 E). In contrast, precursors to sulfide, the taurine-conjugated bile acid taurocholate and taurine, were not inhibitory, suggesting that conversion of these precursors to sulfide is necessary for inhibition ( Figure 4 E). Another prediction of our model is that under low-taurine/sulfide conditions, when respiration is possible, Kpn should experience a growth advantage and thus be able to outcompete a Kpn respiration mutant. In contrast, under high-taurine/sulfide conditions, when respiration is limited, Kpn should not experience a growth advantage and thus be more equal in fitness to a Kpn respiration mutant ( Figure 4 A). To test these predictions, we competed the Kpn WT and cyxB − respiration mutant in mice treated with the vehicle or taurine. As we predicted, in vehicle-treated mice, the WT outcompeted the respiration mutant, whereas in taurine-treated mice, the WT and mutant exhibited comparable fitness ( Figures 4 F and S5 E). Similarly, in vehicle-treated mice, the WT outcompeted a 1,2-propanediol utilization mutant ( pduQ − ), whereas in taurine-treated mice, the WT and mutant again exhibited comparable fitness ( Figures 4 F, S5 C, and S5E). Further supporting our model, a Kpn mutant ( acrE − ) capable of respiring with 1,2-propanediol could not be outcompeted by the WT in either vehicle or taurine-treated mice ( Figures S5 C–S5E).
We next tested our model in the context of C. rodentium infection since, like Kpn , C. rodentium exploits aerobic respiration to colonize the gut ( Lopez et al., 2016 36. Lopez, C.A. ∙ Miller, B.M. ∙ Rivera-Chávez, F. ... Virulence factors enhance Citrobacter rodentium expansion through aerobic respiration Science. 2016; 353 :1249-1253 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, C. rodentium leverages the cytochrome oxidase bd -I, encoded by cydAB , to access non-fermentable substrates such as formate ( Lopez et al., 2016 36. Lopez, C.A. ∙ Miller, B.M. ∙ Rivera-Chávez, F. ... Virulence factors enhance Citrobacter rodentium expansion through aerobic respiration Science. 2016; 353 :1249-1253 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S5 F). As predicted, >500 μM sulfide blocks the ability of C. rodentium to grow on formate with oxygen ( Figure S5 G). Furthermore, in vehicle-treated mice, the C. rodentium WT ultimately outcompeted a cydAB − respiration mutant, whereas similar to our observations for Kpn , the competitive advantage of the WT was impeded in taurine-treated mice ( Figure S5 H). Together, these findings support an overarching model where taurine-driven sulfide production enhances colonization resistance, specifically by inhibiting the ability of pathogens to aerobically respire and thus access strictly respiratory substrates ( Figure 4 G).
Because the microbiota produces a baseline level of sulfide ( Figure 3 I), we next wondered whether homeostatic sulfide itself shapes gut microbial ecology and colonization resistance. To test this, we placed mice onto drinking water containing the sulfide sequestrant bismuth subsalicylate, a compound commonly consumed in over-the-counter remedies for upset stomach ( Bierer, 1990 5. Bierer, D.W. Bismuth subsalicylate: history, chemistry, and safety Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12 :S3-S8 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 A). Bismuth sequesters sulfide by forming an insoluble precipitate ( Bierer, 1990 5. Bierer, D.W. Bismuth subsalicylate: history, chemistry, and safety Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12 :S3-S8 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ), and indeed, we observed that the gut microbiota releases significantly less sulfide after bismuth treatment ( Figure 5 B).
This observation led us to test the following model: in the absence of bismuth, homeostatic sulfide restricts respirers from accessing oxygen, whereas in the presence of bismuth, sulfide sequestration increases oxygen availability, promoting invasion by respirers such as Kpn ( Figure 5 C). Furthermore, since respirers are endogenous to the microbiota, we predicted that sulfide sequestration would promote their expansion as well. Confirming our prediction, bismuth rapidly altered the microbiota by inducing a pronounced expansion of a Bacilli taxon ( Figures 5 D and 5E; Table S1 ). Isolation of this taxon revealed it to be Enterococcus faecalis , a frequent cause of hospital-associated infections ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019 11. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 2019 Crossref Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 F). Unlike many other Enterococcus species, E. faecalis can gain energy from aerobic respiration ( Ramsey et al., 2014 51. Ramsey, M. ∙ Hartke, A. ∙ Huycke, M. The Physiology and Metabolism of Enterococci Gilmore, M.S. (Editor) Enterococci: From Commensals to Leading Causes of Drug Resistant Infection Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA, 2014 Google Scholar ). In line with this, whole-genome sequencing confirmed the presence of a cytochrome oxidase ( bd -I) in bismuth-induced E. faecalis ( Table S5 ). Besides E. faecalis , the potentially pathogenic gammaproteobacterium Escherichia coli also expanded after sulfide sequestration ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Because E. coli is capable of respiring with oxygen, its co-expansion with E. faecalis supports our model that homeostatic sulfide shapes gut ecology by subduing low-abundance, potentially pathogenic respirers.
According to our proposed model, sulfide should restrict not only endogenous but also invading oxygen respirers ( Figure 5 C). To test this, we assessed the impact of sulfide sequestration on colonization resistance. As predicted by our model, we found that bismuth rendered mice highly susceptible to colonization by Kpn , allowing for a nearly 5 log increase in Kpn fecal burden ( Figure 5 G). Thus, our results support the idea that, by sequestering sulfide, bismuth may promote aerobic respiration by potentially pathogenic, resident members of the microbiota, and invading pathogens. A confounding factor to consider when interpreting these studies is that, in addition to sequestering sulfide, bismuth has antimicrobial properties ( Bierer, 1990 5. Bierer, D.W. Bismuth subsalicylate: history, chemistry, and safety Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12 :S3-S8 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, these results complement our overarching model that, by increasing the microbiota’s production of sulfide, taurine restricts pathogen respiration and thus enhances colonization resistance ( Figure 5 H).

Section: Discussion

We are entering a post-antibiotics “dark age” where once curable maladies could become life threatening due to the spread of antibiotic resistance ( United Nations Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, 2019 65. United Nations Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance No Time to Wait: Securing the future from drug-resistant infections 2019 https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/final-report/en/ Google Scholar ). Moving forward, one possible path is to leverage the microbiota, as exemplified by fecal microbiota transplantation ( Pamer, 2014 47. Pamer, E.G. Fecal microbiota transplantation: effectiveness, complexities, and lingering concerns Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7 :210-214 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, an obstacle to microbiota-based therapies is the microbiota’s vast inter-individual heterogeneity ( Suez and Elinav, 2017 64. Suez, J. ∙ Elinav, E. The path towards microbiome-based metabolite treatment Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17075 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). As the majority of beneficial host-microbe interactions are mediated by widely conserved metabolites, therapeutically co-opting metabolites, rather than their microbial targets/producers, may result in wider success ( Suez and Elinav, 2017 64. Suez, J. ∙ Elinav, E. The path towards microbiome-based metabolite treatment Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17075 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In the present work, we discovered that transient infection establishes long-term “metaorganism memory.” Unlike traditional immunological memory, metaorganism memory hinges upon interdependent host and microbiota functions. Following infection, the host amplifies its production/transport of bile acids, and, in turn, the microbiota converts a bile-acid-derived metabolite, taurine, to the antimicrobial sulfide. Thus, only together do these functions bolster metaorganism resistance to subsequent infection. Because the microbiota function, the metabolism of taurine, is widely distributed ( Cook and Denger, 2006 14. Cook, A.M. ∙ Denger, K. Metabolism of taurine in microorganisms: A primer in molecular biodiversity? Oja, S.S. ∙ Saransaari, P. (Editors) Taurine 6, Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology Springer, Boston, MA, Volume 583. 2006; 3-13 Google Scholar ), it overcomes the obstacle of inter-individual heterogeneity in microbiota composition. Furthermore, the target of sulfide, aerobic respiration, is a widely (though not universally [ Neumann-Schaal et al., 2019 46. Neumann-Schaal, M. ∙ Jahn, D. ∙ Schmidt-Hohagen, K. Metabolism the difficile way: The key to the success of the pathogen Clostridioides difficile Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10 :219 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ]) distributed virulence factor.
While our work focused on how infection-elicited taurine functionally remodels the microbiota, our findings do not fully exclude a role for the immune system. Indeed, the cellular transport of taurine is critical for the establishment of immunological memory ( Kaesler et al., 2012 28. Kaesler, S. ∙ Sobiesiak, M. ∙ Kneilling, M. ... Effective T-cell recall responses require the taurine transporter Taut Eur. J. Immunol. 2012; 42 :831-841 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), and, besides taurine, our data suggest gut infection also elicits the innate immune effector xanthine oxidase ( Martin et al., 2004 40. Martin, H.M. ∙ Hancock, J.T. ∙ Salisbury, V. ... Role of xanthine oxidoreductase as an antimicrobial agent Infect. Immun. 2004; 72 :4933-4939 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the microbial metabolite menaquinone, a precursor of which induces antimicrobial peptides ( Fukumoto et al., 2014 20. Fukumoto, S. ∙ Toshimitsu, T. ∙ Matsuoka, S. ... Identification of a probiotic bacteria-derived activator of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor that inhibits colitis Immunol. Cell Biol. 2014; 92 :460-465 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the immune system may work in concert with the microbiota to promote colonization resistance following infection.
Our work suggests that bile-acid-derived taurine is beneficial for colonization resistance, but, if truly the case, it raises the question of why bile acids are not always maintained at high levels. The most likely answer is that excessive bile acids are associated with various inflammatory disorders and cancers ( Jia et al., 2018 27. Jia, W. ∙ Xie, G. ∙ Jia, W. Bile acid-microbiota crosstalk in gastrointestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 15 :111-128 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite this, bile acids are upregulated by enteric infections, most likely because they are antimicrobial and aid pathogen clearance ( Uribe et al., 2016 66. Uribe, J.H. ∙ Collado-Romero, M. ∙ Zaldívar-López, S. ... Transcriptional analysis of porcine intestinal mucosa infected with Salmonella Typhimurium revealed a massive inflammatory response and disruption of bile acid absorption in ileum Vet. Res. (Faisalabad). 2016; 47 :11 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). An outstanding question is what infection-induced signaling events lead to host upregulation of bile acids. While this question is made particularly challenging by the numerous receptors and pathways that control bile acid metabolism ( Jia et al., 2018 27. Jia, W. ∙ Xie, G. ∙ Jia, W. Bile acid-microbiota crosstalk in gastrointestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 15 :111-128 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ), potential candidates are the farnesoid X receptor and the hormone fibroblast growth factor 15 ( Romain et al., 2013 54. Romain, G. ∙ Tremblay, S. ∙ Arena, E.T. ... Enterohepatic bacterial infections dysregulate the FGF15-FGFR4 endocrine axis BMC Microbiol. 2013; 13 :238 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Uribe et al., 2016 66. Uribe, J.H. ∙ Collado-Romero, M. ∙ Zaldívar-López, S. ... Transcriptional analysis of porcine intestinal mucosa infected with Salmonella Typhimurium revealed a massive inflammatory response and disruption of bile acid absorption in ileum Vet. Res. (Faisalabad). 2016; 47 :11 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Together, our work highlights the key contribution of taurine and sulfide to the trainable resistance of the gut microbiota to infection. By probing the consequence of pathogenic exposures on colonization resistance, we discovered that host metaorganisms adapt to infections by nourishing their gut microbiota with taurine, a strategy that serves to boost the microbiota’s production of sulfide and ensure its heightened resistance against future pathogen invasions.

Conventional SPF C57BL/6 and congenic CD45.1 mice (used interchangeably) were acquired from Taconic Biosciences (only barriers positive for segmented filamentous bacteria) and maintained at NIAID or NIDDK animal facilities. WildR SPF C57BL/6 mice were created, bred, and maintained at an NIDDK animal facility ( Rosshart et al., 2017 55. Rosshart, S.P. ∙ Vassallo, B.G. ∙ Angeletti, D. ... Wild Mouse Gut Microbiota Promotes Host Fitness and Improves Disease Resistance Cell. 2017; 171 :1015-1028.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ), then transferred entirely to Taconic Biosciences. The F10 wildR mice in this study were analyzed after wildR mice had been re-imported from Taconic Biosciences to NIDDK. GF C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained at the NIAID Microbiome Program Gnotobiotic Animal Facility. All facilities were accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International, and all animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals under animal study proposals approved by the NIAID or NIDDK Animal Care and Use Committees. Sex- and age-matched mice between 6-20 weeks of age were used for all experiments. Female and male mice were used for experiments with wildR and GF mice, while only female mice were used for experiments involving only conventional mice.
The Y. pseudotuberculosis , Kpn , C. rodentium , and B. wadsworthia WT strains were 32777, MKP103 (a KPNIH1 derivative with the KPC-3 carbapenemase-encoding gene deleted ( Ramage et al., 2017 49. Ramage, B. ∙ Erolin, R. ∙ Held, K. ... Comprehensive arrayed transposon mutant library of Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak strain KPNIH1 J. Bacteriol. 2017; 199 :e00352 e17 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar )), ICC169 (an ICC168 derivative resistant to nalidixic acid), and ATCC 49260. The Kpn cyxB - , pduQ - , and acrE - Tn mutants were purified from the MKP103 Tn mutant library ( Ramage et al., 2017 49. Ramage, B. ∙ Erolin, R. ∙ Held, K. ... Comprehensive arrayed transposon mutant library of Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak strain KPNIH1 J. Bacteriol. 2017; 199 :e00352 e17 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) and confirmed via PCR. Y. pseudotuberculosis ΔyopM ( Han et al., 2017 24. Han, S.J. ∙ Glatman Zaretsky, A. ∙ Andrade-Oliveira, V. ... White adipose tissue is a reservoir for memory T cells and promotes protective memory responses to infection Immunity. 2017; 47 :1154-1168.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) was routinely revived on LB agar and cultured in 2x YT broth at 25°C with shaking at 200-250 rpm. Kpn and C. rodentium WT and mutant strains were routinely revived on LB agar and cultured in LB broth (10 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, 8 g/l NaCl) at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. B. wadsworthia was routinely revived on Wilkins-Chalgren agar + 50 mM taurine and cultured in Wilkins-Chalgren broth + 50 mM taurine at 37°C without shaking in an anaerobic chamber (Whitley Workstation A85).
Overnight (12-14 hour) Y. pseudotuberculosis ΔyopM cultures were resuspended in PBS, adjusted to an absorbance at 600 nm (A 600 ) of 0.1 in PBS, and gavaged into mice fasted overnight for 13-15 hours (∼2 × 10 7 CFU in 200 μl/mouse). Overnight Kpn cultures were resuspended in LB, adjusted to an A 600 of 1 in LB, and gavaged into overnight-fasted mice (∼2 × 10 8 CFU in 200 μl/mouse). Overnight C. rodentium cultures were resuspended in PBS, adjusted to an A 600 of 5 or 25, and gavaged into non-fasted mice (∼1 or 5 × 10 9 CFU in 200 μl/mouse). For C. rodentium experiments, mouse cages were not changed from 3-5 days before infection until 5 days after infection. For in vivo competition experiments, the same procedures as described above were followed, except that the WT and mutant were mixed together at a 1:1 ratio prior to gavage. When pelleting cultures, all bacteria were centrifuged at 3-4,000 x g for 2-5 minutes at room temperature. All absorbances were measured with a spectrophotometer (Biochrom).
To treat mice with taurine, mice were placed onto non-acidified tap water + 200 mM taurine for 2-3 weeks prior to infection, during which fresh water was provided every 3-5 days. At the same as when mice were first placed onto taurine water, mice were exchanged between paired control and treatment cages, the intent being to reduce microbiota variability between cages (generally, 2 mice in a control cage of 5 mice were exchanged with 2 mice in a treatment cage of 5 mice). Starting the evening (12-14 hours) prior to Kpn infection, mice were placed onto non-acidified tap water lacking taurine, to avoid stimulation of Kpn growth by taurine. To treat mice with bismuth, starting the evening prior to infection, mice were placed onto non-acidified tap water + 20 mM bismuth subsalicylate and maintained on bismuth water throughout the course of infection. To treat mice with streptomycin, mice were gavaged with 20 mg streptomycin (200 μl of a freshly prepared 100 mg/ml solution) 1 day prior to infection.
Fecal pellets (colon lumen samples) were collected directly from mice or by placing mice into paper cups. Cecum lumen samples were collected by squeezing out the contents of extracted ceca using forceps. Mucosal samples were collected by cutting extracted tissues (colons, ceca, or ilea) open longitudinally, thoroughly rinsing tissues in Petri dishes with PBS, scraping the interior surface of rinsed tissues using closed forceps, and collecting the scrapings (mucosa). The PBS used to rinse ileal tissues was transferred to 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm (2,880 x g) for 5 minutes at room temperature to collect the pellets (ileum lumen samples). All gut samples were transferred or collected directly into pre-weighed 1.5 mL tubes, weighed after collection, homogenized in 500 μl PBS using a pipette tip, and vortexed for 5 s. After allowing large particles to settle, top fractions were collected to determine CFU.
CFU were determined for both gut samples and in vitro growth assays as described using a multichannel pipette ( Hung et al., 2009 26. Hung, C.-S. ∙ Dodson, K.W. ∙ Hultgren, S.J. A murine model of urinary tract infection Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :1230-1243 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, samples were serially diluted in 96-well plates with PBS, and 10 μl of each dilution was spotted 5 times onto LB agar (1 plate per sample, 50 μl per dilution). For in vitro growth assays, LB without antibiotics was used to determine total CFU; LB + 175 μg/ml chloramphenicol, Kpn Tn mutant CFU; LB + 100 μg/ml kanamycin, C. rodentium cydAB - CFU. For gut samples, LB + 50 μg/ml ampicillin + 100 μg/ml neomycin + 100 μg/ml vancomycin was used to determine total Kpn CFU; the same media + 175 μg/ml chloramphenicol, Kpn Tn mutant CFU; LB + 50 μg/ml nalidixic acid, total C. rodentium CFU (only large colonies); the same media + 100 μg/ml kanamycin, C. rodentium cydAB - CFU. In competition assays, samples with fewer than 10 total CFU were excluded from final results.
No carbon E (NCE) minimal medium ( Faber et al., 2017 17. Faber, F. ∙ Thiennimitr, P. ∙ Spiga, L. ... Respiration of microbiota-derived 1,2-propanediol drives Salmonella expansion during colitis PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006129 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ) for in vitro growth assays (below) was prepared from stock solutions in diH 2 O: 1) 10x salts (at 1x, 29 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 28.3 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 16.7 mM NaNH 4 HPO 4 ), 2) 1000x MgSO 4 (at 1x, 1 mM), and 3) 1000x trace metals (at 1x, 0.3 μM CaCl 2 , 3 μM CoCl 2 , 0.1 μM CuSO 4 , 2 μM MnSO 4 , 0.2 μM Na 2 MoO 4 , 0.2 μM Na 2 SeO 3 , 0.1 μM NiSO 4 , 0.1 μM ZnSO 4 ).
All overnight cultures for growth assays were grown without shaking in an anaerobic chamber, diluted 1:250 into test media that was pre-reduced overnight in the anaerobic chamber, and further grown for 23-25 hours in either the anaerobic chamber, a hypoxic chamber (Baker Ruskinn PhO 2 x Box) with 0.8% oxygen, an anaerobic jar with a microaerophilic sachet (6%–12% oxygen), or in air (21% oxygen) prior to determining CFU. To assess electron acceptor usage, overnight cultures in LB were diluted into NCE + 5 mM 1,2-propanediol + 50 mM electron acceptor or vehicle (water). For in vitro competition experiments, WT and mutant overnight cultures in NCE + 0.2% yeast extract + 50 mM carbon source (1,2-propanediol or formate) were mixed together at a 1:1 ratio and diluted into NCE + 5 mM carbon source. For inhibition assays, overnight cultures in NCE + 0.2% yeast extract + 50 mM carbon source (1,2-propanediol or formate) were diluted into NCE + 5 mM carbon source + 5 mM taurocholate, 5 mM taurine, sodium hydrosulfide (0.125-1 mM for Kpn or 1-5 mM for C. rodentium ), or vehicle (water). Sodium hydrosulfide was freshly prepared for all experiments.
To assess sulfur source usage, B. wadsworthia was grown overnight in pre-reduced Wilkins-Chalgren broth + 50 mM taurine without shaking in an anaerobic chamber, diluted 1:500 into pre-reduced Wilkins-Chalgren broth + 50 mM sulfur source (taurine or magnesium sulfate) or vehicle (water), and further grown overnight in the anaerobic chamber prior to measuring A 600 . To assess growth stimulation by DHNA, overnight cultures in NCE (with 1 mM MgCl 2 rather than MgSO 4 ) + 50 mM taurine + 50 mM formate were diluted 1:500 into the same medium + 276 μg/ml ferrous ammonium sulfate + 200 μg/ml DHNA or vehicle (ethanol) and further grown in the anaerobic chamber.
To delete cydAB from C. rodentium ICC169, pCAL60, a plasmid previously constructed to delete cydAB from C. rodentium DBS100, was used ( Lopez et al., 2016 36. Lopez, C.A. ∙ Miller, B.M. ∙ Rivera-Chávez, F. ... Virulence factors enhance Citrobacter rodentium expansion through aerobic respiration Science. 2016; 353 :1249-1253 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). This plasmid contains 1) a kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by the regions up and downstream of cydAB , 2) a chloramphenicol resistance cassette on the backbone, and 3) to allow for blue/white screening, the Salmonella Typhimurium phoN gene on the backbone. To conjugate pCAL60 from E. coli S17-1 λ-pir (donor) into C. rodentium ICC169 (recipient), overnight cultures of the recipient (diluted 1:10 into fresh LB) and donor (not diluted) were resuspended in fresh LB, mixed 1:1, and spotted onto polycarbonate membranes (100 μl/membrane) placed onto LB agar. After 4-6 hours, conjugations were resuspended in 1 mL LB and struck onto LB agar with 50 μg/ml nalidixic acid (to select against E. coli S17-1 λ-pir), 100 μg/ml kanamycin (to select for single crossover events), and 40 μg/ml X-phos (to screen for double crossover events). White colonies were screened for sensitivity to 15 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and sensitive colonies were confirmed for cydAB deletion via PCR.
For lung infections, Kpn ATCC 43816 was used since this strain is highly virulent in lung infection models ( Broberg et al., 2014 8. Broberg, C.A. ∙ Wu, W. ∙ Cavalcoli, J.D. ... Complete Genome Sequence of Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain ATCC 43816 KPPR1, a Rifampin-Resistant Mutant Commonly Used in Animal, Genetic, and Molecular Biology Studies Genome Announc. 2014; 2 :e00924 e14 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Kpn was inoculated directly from a freezer stock into 50 mL Nutrient broth and cultured for 7 hours at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Mice anesthetized with isoflurane were intratracheally inoculated with 3 × 10 3 CFU in 80 μl. After 36 hours, lungs were harvested into pre-weighed tubes with PBS (1 ml/lung) and 1.5 mm zirconium beads, weighed after collection, homogenized at 5,000 rpm for 2 20 s cycles using a Precellys 24 (Bertin Instruments), and plated onto MacConkey agar to determine CFU.
Fecal samples from post- ΔyopM mice were frozen at −80°C prior to being processed, while samples from taurine-treated mice were processed shortly after being collected. Samples were transferred into an anaerobic chamber, homogenized in pre-reduced PBS (∼20 μl/mg feces) using a pipette tip, and vortexed for 5 s. After allowing large particles to settle, top fractions were diluted 1:5 into pre-reduced PBS, mixed 1:1 with pre-reduced 20% glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Prior to gavage into GF mice, aliquots were thawed in the anaerobic chamber and mixed 1:1 with pre-reduced PBS.
GF mice were transferred using aseptic technique into sterile cages with acidified drinking water, immediately gavaged with 200 μl microbiota (revived in 5% glycerol, as described in the previous section), housed under SPF conditions, and gavaged twice more with microbiota on consecutive days. To pre-engraft GF mice with B. wadsworthia , mice were 1) aseptically transferred to SPF cages, 2) immediately gavaged with 200 μl of concentrated B. wadsworthia (an overnight 25 mL culture resuspended in 1-2 mL Wilkins-Chalgren broth), 3) gavaged the following day again with B. wadsworthia , 4) hours after the second B. wadsworthia gavage, gavaged with 200 μl SPF microbiota (freshly prepared by homogenizing fecal pellets in pre-reduced PBS in an anaerobic chamber), 5) gavaged the following day again with freshly prepared SPF microbiota. After conventionalization, mice were rested for 1.5-2 weeks prior to infection, during which cages were only changed if necessary (e.g., if water bottles leaked). Starting the evening before infection, mice were placed onto non-acidified tap water.
DNA was extracted from fecal pellets using phenol:chloroform ( Goodman et al., 2011 21. Goodman, A.L. ∙ Wu, M. ∙ Gordon, J.I. Identifying microbial fitness determinants by insertion sequencing using genome-wide transposon mutant libraries Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6 :1969-1980 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ) or the MagAttract PowerMicrobiome DNA/RNA Kit. 16S V4 rDNA libraries were prepared using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with primers 515F and 806R ( Caporaso et al., 2012 10. Caporaso, J.G. ∙ Lauber, C.L. ∙ Walters, W.A. ... Ultra-high-throughput microbial community analysis on the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms ISME J. 2012; 6 :1621-1624 Crossref Scopus (6375) PubMed Google Scholar ), and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument by the NIAID Microbiome Program core facility, with the exception of fecal pellets from F10 wildR mice, which were processed and sequenced by the NCI Cancer and Inflammation Program Microbiome and Genetics Core.
16S data were analyzed using QIIME 2 ( Bolyen et al., 2019 7. Bolyen, E. ∙ Rideout, J.R. ∙ Dillon, M.R. ... Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2 Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :852-857 Crossref Scopus (11052) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, reads were denoised using the q2-dada2 plugin (exact parameters were forward reads truncated to 180 bases with 20 bases trimmed from the 5′ end, reverse reads truncated to 150 bases with 20 bases trimmed from the 5′ end, and bases truncated with quality score below 10). Using the q2-feature-table plugin, samples within an experiment were rarefied to the depth of the sample with the fewest reads (> 19,000 reads for all experiments), and sequence variants were filtered if within an experiment they did not occur in at least 3 samples. Rooted phylogenetic trees were generated using the align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree method in the q2-phylogeny plugin. Alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using the core-metrics-phylogenetic method in the q2-diveristy plugin, with a sampling depth of 5,000 reads. Taxonomy was assigned to sequence variants using the q2-feature-classifier plugin and a naive Bayes classifier pre-trained on the SILVA 132 515F/806R 99% OTUs ( Yilmaz et al., 2014 70. Yilmaz, P. ∙ Parfrey, L.W. ∙ Yarza, P. ... The SILVA and “All-species Living Tree Project (LTP)” taxonomic frameworks Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :D643-D648 Crossref Scopus (2218) PubMed Google Scholar ) provided as a QIIME 2 data resource. A pseudocount was applied prior to calculating differences in the relative abundance of taxonomic groups. In parallel, the same workflow was used to re-analyze published 16S data for fecal pellets from post- Yptb WT mice ( Fonseca et al., 2015 18. Fonseca, D.M. ∙ Hand, T.W. ∙ Han, S.J. ... Microbiota-dependent sequelae of acute infection compromise tissue-specific immunity Cell. 2015; 163 :354-366 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ) and published 16S data for ileocecal material from F2 labR and F2 wildR mice ( Rosshart et al., 2017 55. Rosshart, S.P. ∙ Vassallo, B.G. ∙ Angeletti, D. ... Wild Mouse Gut Microbiota Promotes Host Fitness and Improves Disease Resistance Cell. 2017; 171 :1015-1028.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Metagenomics libraries were generated using the Illumina DNA Prep kit, with 500 ng purified DNA as template, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument (average depth per sample, 3.6 Gb; range, 2.7-4.5 Gb) by the NIAID Microbiome Program core facility.
Data were analyzed using an in-house package ( https://github.com/johnmcculloch/JAMS_BW ) as described ( Rosshart et al., 2019 56. Rosshart, S.P. ∙ Herz, J. ∙ Vassallo, B.G. ... Laboratory mice born to wild mice have natural microbiota and model human immune responses Science. 2019; 365 :eaaw4361 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). In parallel, the same package was used to re-analyze published metagenomics data for ileocecal material from F2 labR and F2 wildR mice ( Rosshart et al., 2017 55. Rosshart, S.P. ∙ Vassallo, B.G. ∙ Angeletti, D. ... Wild Mouse Gut Microbiota Promotes Host Fitness and Improves Disease Resistance Cell. 2017; 171 :1015-1028.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, sequencing reads were processed using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 6. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (38307) PubMed Google Scholar ); host-derived reads were filtered using Bowtie 2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 31. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ); microbiota-derived reads were assembled into contigs using Megahit ( Li et al., 2015 33. Li, D. ∙ Liu, C.M. ∙ Luo, R. ... MEGAHIT: an ultra-fast single-node solution for large and complex metagenomics assembly via succinct de Bruijn graph Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :1674-1676 Crossref Scopus (4174) PubMed Google Scholar ); genes within contigs were predicted and annotated with EC numbers using Prokka ( Seemann, 2014 59. Seemann, T. Prokka: rapid prokaryotic genome annotation Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2068-2069 Crossref Scopus (10433) PubMed Google Scholar ); the relative abundance of EC numbers was determined by aligning microbiota-derived reads back to contigs using Bowtie 2; contigs and unassembled reads were taxonomically classified by k-mer analysis using Kraken 2 ( Wood et al., 2019 68. Wood, D.E. ∙ Lu, J. ∙ Langmead, B. Improved metagenomic analysis with Kraken 2 Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :257 Crossref Scopus (2660) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, as reference, a custom-built database of all genome sequences in GenBank. The relative contribution of taxa to individual EC numbers was determined by tallying the read coverage of each single gene with a particular EC number and obtaining the taxonomic information for that single gene from the Kraken 2 identification of the exact contig in which the gene was predicted ab initio .
Of note, for many of the functions in Figure 2 , more than one species of Desulfovibrio was often identified as contributing to each function. However, based on 16S analysis, all post- ΔyopM samples were determined to contain only a single species of Desulfovibrio . Thus, the metagenomic identification of multiple species of Desulfovibrio was deemed an artifact due to the relatively low depth of Desulfovibrio -derived sequencing reads. Because of this, the multiple species of Desulfovibrio identified as contributing to each function in Figure 2 were aggregated into a single unidentified Desulfovibrio species.
Cecal contents collected onto dry ice were submitted to the West Coast Metabolomics Center at the University of California, Davis. The relative abundance of 449 metabolites (186 defined, 263 undefined) was quantified using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). The absolute abundance of 23 bile acids was quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
Fecal taurine and total bile acids were measured using colorimetric assay kits (Cell Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that 1) all reagent volumes were halved, and 2a) fecal samples were collected into pre-weighed tubes with PBS (10 μl/mg feces) and 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads, 2b) homogenized at 5,000 rpm for 3 20 s cycles using a Precellys 24 (Bertin Instruments), and 2c) centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 2 minutes to collect supernatants. Fecal pellets for measuring taurine and total bile acids were collected in the morning.
Sulfide production by ex vivo microbiota cultures was measured using the OxiSelect Free Hydrogen Sulfide Assay Kit. Briefly, freshly collected fecal samples were transferred into an anaerobic chamber, homogenized in pre-reduced PBS (∼20 μl/mg feces) using a pipette tip, and vortexed for 5 s. To establish ex vivo cultures, the top fraction of fecal homogenates was diluted 1:1 with pre-reduced PBS, and 225 μl was transferred into non-adjacent wells of a 96-well plate containing 25 μl vehicle (0.5 M NaCl) or 25 μl 0.5 M taurine and 0.5 M sodium formate. The areas of the 96-well plate lid directly above sample wells were each coated with 20-25 μl of the Lid Coating Mix, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and after placing the lid over the cultures, it was removed at 15-20 minute intervals from the anaerobic chamber to measure absorbance at 405 nm on a plate reader (BioTek Synergy HTX). Standard curves were generated using freshly prepared sodium hydrosulfide and measured in the same plates as ex vivo cultures.
The Kpn MKP103 Tn mutant library ( Ramage et al., 2017 49. Ramage, B. ∙ Erolin, R. ∙ Held, K. ... Comprehensive arrayed transposon mutant library of Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak strain KPNIH1 J. Bacteriol. 2017; 199 :e00352 e17 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) arrayed into 96-well plates was revived overnight in LB at 37°C without shaking, combined into a single pool, mixed 1:1 with 50% glycerol, and stored as aliquots at −80°C. Thawed aliquots were grown overnight (12-14 hours) and prepared for gavage as described above for routine Kpn infections. DNA extracted from fecal samples collected at 8 hours post-infection was used as template in the 2-PCR method for generating Tn-seq sequencing libraries, according to a published protocol ( Stacy et al., 2016 62. Stacy, A. ∙ Fleming, D. ∙ Lamont, R.J. ... A commensal bacterium promotes virulence of an opportunistic pathogen via cross-respiration MBio. 2016; 7 :e00782 e16 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), except with primers designed for the Kpn Tn mutant library. Briefly, DNA was C-tailed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, PCR-amplified with a biotinylated primer targeting the Tn sequence and a primer targeting the C-tail (PCR-1), purified with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, further PCR-amplified to append forward and reverse Illumina adaptor sequences (PCR-2), and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument by the NCI Cancer and Inflammation Program Microbiome and Genetics Core.
Tn-seq data were analyzed largely as described ( Stacy et al., 2016 62. Stacy, A. ∙ Fleming, D. ∙ Lamont, R.J. ... A commensal bacterium promotes virulence of an opportunistic pathogen via cross-respiration MBio. 2016; 7 :e00782 e16 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). 1) Reads were processed as follows using Cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 39. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. J. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ): a) the exact Tn sequence ATGTGTATAAGAGACAG was trimmed from 5′ ends (this quality-control sequence should be amplified by the second Tn-specific forward primer immediately prior to Kpn DNA), b) C-tails and low-quality bases (Q < 20) were trimmed from 3′ ends, and c) reads were trimmed to 20-25 bases in length. 2) Processed reads were mapped to the KPNIH1 genome using Bowtie 2 (default end-to-end alignment) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 31. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ). 3) In Unix, a) low-quality alignments (Q < 39) were filtered, b) the number of unique Tn per sample was tallied (in doing so, the 9 base duplication of the Tn5 target sequence ( Goryshin et al., 1998 23. Goryshin, I.Y. ∙ Miller, J.A. ∙ Kil, Y.V. ... Tn5/IS50 target recognition Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :10716-10721 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ) was trimmed from alignments mapping to the negative strand), c) to achieve a uniform density of 5,000-6,000 Tn per sample, samples with < 5,000 Tn were concatenated, and samples with > 6,000 Tn were rarefied (alignments were discarded), and d) the relative abundance per unique Tn was tallied for each sample. 4) The relative Tn abundance per gene was tallied for each sample using Rsubread ( Liao et al., 2019 35. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. The R package Rsubread is easier, faster, cheaper and better for alignment and quantification of RNA sequencing reads Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :e47 Crossref Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5) Samples were normalized for differences in sequencing depth using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 37. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ), and differential Tn abundance per gene was assessed using the DESeq2 Wald test. The KPNIH1 genome was annotated with K numbers using the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server ( Moriya et al., 2007 44. Moriya, Y. ∙ Itoh, M. ∙ Okuda, S. ... KAAS: an automatic genome annotation and pathway reconstruction server Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :W182-5 Crossref Scopus (3111) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To isolate cells from large intestinal lamina propria, large intestines (LI, colons with ceca) were extracted with minimal attached fat into complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol) + 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS) on ice. LI were cut open longitudinally, thoroughly rinsed in PBS to remove feces, cut into 1-2 cm pieces, and incubated in 10 mL complete medium + 3% FBS + 5 mM EDTA + 1 mM DTT for 20 minutes at 37°C with stirring. To remove epithelial cells, LI were next vigorously shaken in 10-15 mL complete medium + 2 mM EDTA in 50 mL conical tubes for 15-20 s and strained. After performing this procedure 3 times (each time with fresh media), LI were minced into fine pieces with scissors and digested in 10 mL complete medium + 0.1 mg/ml Liberase TL + 0.5 mg/ml DNase I for 25-30 minutes at 37°C with stirring. Digestions were stopped with 10 mL ice-cold complete medium + 3% FBS, passed through 70-μm filters, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes, resuspended in 4 mL 37.5% Percoll, centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 5 minutes, and resuspended in 300 μl complete medium + 3% FBS.
To isolate cells from livers, livers were disassociated through 70-μm filters with 4-6 mL complete medium, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes, resuspended in 10 mL 37.5% Percoll, centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 5 minutes, and resuspended in 300 μl complete medium + 3% FBS.
To assess myeloid cells, 100 μl of 300 μl single-cell suspensions were stained on ice for 15 minutes in PBS with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (against CD45 diluted 1:300; TCRβ, 1:400; TCRγδ, 1:400; B220, 1:400; NK1.1, 1:400; CD11b, 1:200; Ly-6G, 1:500; Siglec-F, 1:300; CD11c, 1:200; CD64, 1:200; MHC-II, 1:1000; CD103, 1:200; CD24, 1:500; Ly-6C, 1:400; CCR2, 1:100), fixable live/dead stain, Fc Block, and counting beads (to quantify cell numbers) and fixed on ice for at least 1 hour using the Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit.
To assess T cells, 200 μl of 300 μl single-cell suspensions were restimulated in vitro in complete medium + 10% FBS + 50 ng/ml PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) + 1 mM ionomycin + 1 μl/ml GolgiPlug for 2.5 hours at 37°C, stained on ice for 15 minutes in PBS with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against surface targets (CD45 diluted 1:500; CD90.2, 1:400; TCRβ, 1:200; CD4, 1:200; CD8β, 1:400), fixable live/dead stain, Fc Block, and counting beads (to quantify cell numbers), fixed on ice for at least 1 hour using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set, and stained at room temperature for at least 30 minutes with antibodies against intracellular targets (Foxp3 diluted 1:100; IFN-γ, 1:100; IL-17A, 1:100; IL-22, 1:100; TCRβ, 1:200; CD4, 1:200). Cells were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa running FACSDiva software, and data were analyzed using FlowJo.
Extracted large intestines (LI, colons with ceca) were cut open longitudinally, thoroughly rinsed in gut wash buffer (HBSS supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 1 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin) + 2% FBS to remove feces, and cut into 1-2 cm pieces. Subsequently, LI were incubated in 10 mL gut wash buffer + 1 mM DTT for 7-8 minutes in a 37°C water bath, vigorously shaken, and strained to discard DTT-containing fractions. After performing this procedure 2 times, LI were incubated in 10 mL gut wash buffer + 5 mM EDTA for 7-8 minutes in a 37°C water bath, vigorously shaken, and strained to collect EDTA-containing fractions. After performing this procedure 2 times, the pooled EDTA-containing fractions were passed through 100-μm filters, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes, washed with DMEM, and digested in 10 mL DMEM + 0.1 U/ml Dispase II + 0.1 mg/ml DNase I for 8 minutes in a 37°C water bath. Digestions were stopped with DMEM + 2.5% FBS, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and washed with gut wash buffer. Cells were stained on ice for 30 minutes in gut wash buffer + 5% FBS with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (against EpCAM diluted 1:500; CD45, 1:1000; CD31, 1:200) and DAPI, and epithelial cells were sorted directly into Buffer RLT using a Sony MA900 (sorting chip size, 100 μm).
Per liver, small pieces (0.5-1 cm in width) from the edge of each lobe were collected together into 1 mL RNAlater, incubated overnight at room temperature, and stored at −20°C. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the exceptions that 1a) samples were transferred to tubes with 1 mL Buffer RLT and 1.5 mm zirconium beads and 1b) homogenized at 5,000 rpm for 3 20 s cycles using a Precellys 24 (Bertin Instruments), and 2) only 50 μl of the homogenate was mixed with 250 μl fresh Buffer RLT + β-mercaptoethanol (14.3 M) and used to extract RNA. For sorted gut epithelial cells, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit. The integrity of extracted RNA was assessed using an Agilent TapeStation. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Universal Plus mRNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (for liver RNA) or the Ovation SoLo RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (for epithelial cell RNA) and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument by the NIH Center for Human Immunology core facility.
RNA-seq data were mapped to the mm10 mouse genome using STAR (default parameters) ( Dobin et al., 2013 16. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples with clonality greater than 2.5 as assessed by HOMER ( Heinz et al., 2010 25. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8020) PubMed Google Scholar ) were excluded. Gene expression was assessed using HOMER’s analyzeRepeats.pl with the options rna, mm10, -count exons, -condenseGenes, and differential gene expression was assessed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 37. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). The enrichment of GO terms was assessed using Metascape ( Zhou et al., 2019 71. Zhou, Y. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Pache, L. ... Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1523 Crossref Scopus (7462) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ribosomal protein and antimicrobial peptide annotations were obtained from the Gene Ontology Browser of the Mouse Genome Informatics website ( Bult et al., 2019 9. Bult, C.J. ∙ Blake, J.A. ∙ Smith, C.L. ..., Mouse Genome Database Group Mouse Genome Database (MGD) 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D801-D806 Crossref Scopus (481) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Gallbladders were carefully extracted into PBS, and any attached fat was removed in a Petri dish using forceps and a scalpel. Prior to being weighed, gallbladders were blotted onto absorbent wipes to remove PBS. Gallbladders that leaked either during extraction or fat removal were excluded from final results.
Liver samples (part of the largest lobe) and colon samples (distal 0.5-1 cm without feces) were fixed in 1 mL 10% neutral buffered formalin and submitted to Histoserv, Inc. for paraffin sectioning and H&E staining. Sections were imaged on a Leica SCN400 slide scanner and analyzed in a blinded manner, liver sections by a trained pathologist and colon sections using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 58. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). The crypt length per mouse was assessed by averaging the length of 20 crypts per colon section.
As previously described ( Dey et al., 2015 15. Dey, N. ∙ Wagner, V.E. ∙ Blanton, L.V. ... Regulators of gut motility revealed by a gnotobiotic model of diet-microbiome interactions related to travel Cell. 2015; 163 :95-107 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ), non-fasted mice were gavaged with 200 μl carmine solution (6% (w/v) carmine in a 0.5% (w/v) methyl cellulose solution), and feces was collected every 30 minutes to assess for the presence of carmine, by streaking the collected feces onto a white paper towel. The time from gavage to the initial appearance of carmine in feces was recorded as the intestinal transit time.
The feces of 2 non-co-housed bismuth-treated mice was homogenized in PBS and struck onto bile esculin azide agar. Four colonies (2 colonies per mouse) were re-struck onto the same media and submitted to the NIAID Research Technologies Branch for species-level identification using a Bruker MALDI Biotyper. All 4 colonies were identified as E. faecalis . Whole-genome sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep kit and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Data were analyzed using the same in-house package as for metagenomics data, with SPAdes as the genome assembler ( Bankevich et al., 2012 2. Bankevich, A. ∙ Nurk, S. ∙ Antipov, D. ... SPAdes: a new genome assembly algorithm and its applications to single-cell sequencing J. Comput. Biol. 2012; 19 :455-477 Crossref Scopus (17085) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Analyzed 16S sequencing data, related to Figures 1, 3, 5, S1, and S3 Relative abundance (%) of taxa (phyla, order, or species, as indicated in tab titles) in the gut microbiota of individual post- Yptb ( ΔyopM or WT) mice (tabs: Yptb phyla and Yptb species), GF mice conventionalized with post- ΔyopM microbiota (tab: GF_yopM species), wildR F2 mice (tabs: wildR_F2 phyla and wildR_F2 species), wildR F10 mice (tabs: wildR_F10 phyla and wildR_F10 species), conventionalized GF mice pre-engrafted with Bilophila wadsworthia (tab: GF_Bilophila species), taurine-treated mice (tab: taurine species), bismuth-treated mice (tabs: bismuth order and bismuth species), and respective control mice. Colors: yellow, p < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney test, adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg method, except for taurine mice); green and red, fold change in median abundance (log2) > 1 and < −1, respectively. Unique feature IDs were generated by QIIME 2. Spreadsheet (1.13 MB) Table S2. Analyzed shotgun metagenomics data, related to Figures 2, 3, and S3 Relative abundance (ppm with a pseudocount) of EC numbers in the gut metagenomes of individual post- ΔyopM (tab: yopM), F2 wildR (tab: wildR), taurine-treated (tab: taurine), and respective control mice, and relative contribution in ppm of individual last known taxa (LKT) to EC numbers in the gut metagenomes of post- ΔyopM (tab: yopM pie), F2 wildR (tab: wildR pie), taurine-treated (tab: taurine pie), and respective control mice. Colors: yellow, p < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney test); green and red, fold change in median abundance (log2) > 0.5 and < −0.5, respectively. Spreadsheet (156.32 KB) Table S3. Analyzed mass spectrometry data, related to Figures 2 and S3 Abundance of primary metabolites (in arbitrary units, tab: primary metabolites) and bile acids (in pg/mg, tab: bile acids) in the cecal contents of individual control and post- ΔyopM mice. Colors: yellow, p < 0.1 (Mann-Whitney test); green and red, fold change in median abundance (log2) > 0.5 and < −0.5, for primary metabolites, or > 0 and < 0, for bile acids. C numbers are KEGG compound database identifiers. In Figure S3, the experiment C value for β-muricholic acid was excluded due to being an outlier. Spreadsheet (8.15 MB) Table S4. Analyzed RNA-seq data, related to Figures S3 and S4 Normalized gene expression (transcripts per million) in the livers of individual control and post- ΔyopM mice (tab: liver) and in the large intestinal epithelial cells of individual vehicle and taurine-treated mice (tab: gut). Colors: yellow, p < 0.1 (Wald test, adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg method); green and red, fold change (log2) > 0.5 and < −0.5, for livers, or > 0 and < 0, for gut epithelial cells. Spreadsheet (1.25 MB) Table S5. Analyzed Tn-seq and whole-genome sequencing data, related to Figures 4 and S5 Normalized Kpn Tn counts per gene in the output pools of individual control and post- ΔyopM mice infected with the Kpn Tn mutant pool (tab: Tn-seq), and genome annotations of E. faecalis strains isolated from bismuth-treated mice (tabs: A1, A2, B1). Colors: yellow, p < 0.05 (Wald test); green and red, fold change (log2) > 1 and < −1, respectively. The following samples were pooled in silico due to bottlenecking (< 5,000 unique Tn insertions): control 4 and 5 (from experiment A); control 6, 7, 8, and 10 (from experiment B); post- ΔyopM 6, 7, 8, and 10 (from experiment B). NA values are DESeq2-filtered outliers. K numbers are KEGG Orthology database identifiers. Genes plotted in Figure S5 are indicated by the last column.
