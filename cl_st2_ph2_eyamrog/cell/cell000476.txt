Title: Microbiota triggers STING-type I IFN-dependent monocyte reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment


Abstract: Summary

The tumor microenvironment (TME) influences cancer progression and therapy response. Therefore, understanding what regulates the TME immune compartment is vital. Here we show that microbiota signals program mononuclear phagocytes in the TME toward immunostimulatory monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that absence of microbiota skews the TME toward pro-tumorigenic macrophages. Mechanistically, we show that microbiota-derived stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists induce type I interferon (IFN-I) production by intratumoral monocytes to regulate macrophage polarization and natural killer (NK) cell-DC crosstalk. Microbiota modulation with a high-fiber diet triggered the intratumoral IFN-I-NK cell-DC axis and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We validated our findings in individuals with melanoma treated with ICB and showed that the predicted intratumoral IFN-I and immune compositional differences between responder and non-responder individuals can be transferred by fecal microbiota transplantation. Our study uncovers a mechanistic link between the microbiota and the innate TME that can be harnessed to improve cancer therapies.

Section: Introduction

Tumors develop alongside a highly complex and dynamic microenvironment, and the interplay among all of its components influences disease progression and response to therapy ( Binnewies et al., 2018 8. Binnewies, M. ∙ Roberts, E.W. ∙ Kersten, K. ... Understanding the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for effective therapy Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :541-550 Crossref Scopus (1372) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immune cells are key players of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and studies have shown that classifying tumors based on their immune composition may have predictive value for clinical outcome ( Bruni et al., 2020 13. Bruni, D. ∙ Angell, H.K. ∙ Galon, J. The immune contexture and Immunoscore in cancer prognosis and therapeutic efficacy Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2020; 20 :662-680 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this regard, much of the field’s focus has been on the adaptive immune compartment, and approaches aiming to awaken T cells, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), have yielded unprecedented results. Unfortunately, however, only a small subset of individuals fully benefit from this approach, and the determinants of resistance are still unclear ( Chen and Mellman, 2017 20. Chen, D.S. ∙ Mellman, I.

Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1834) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the contributing factors to therapy resistance, the immunosuppressive nature of the TME is one of the most challenging. This underscores the need to dissect the signals that regulate the TME.
Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) (i.e., monocytes [Mo], macrophages [Macs], and dendritic cells [DCs]) are innate immune cells that play instrumental roles in host defense, tissue homeostasis, and repair ( Haniffa et al., 2015 42. Haniffa, M. ∙ Bigley, V. ∙ Collin, M. Human mononuclear phagocyte system reunited Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 41 :59-69 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). MPs are also key components of the TME, where they play opposing dual roles: they can induce antitumor responses, but they can also promote tumor immunosuppression and disease progression ( Cotechini et al., 2015 22. Cotechini, T. ∙ Medler, T.R. ∙ Coussens, L.M. Myeloid Cells as Targets for Therapy in Solid Tumors Cancer J. 2015; 21 :343-350 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nakamura and Smyth, 2020 67. Nakamura, K. ∙ Smyth, M.J. Myeloid immunosuppression and immune checkpoints in the tumor microenvironment Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2020; 17 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, MPs can be powerful targets to skew the outcome of anticancer immunity. However, the precise nature of the MP network, which cues regulate its composition and functional state, and how this affects antitumor immunity is not well understood, making their therapeutic targeting difficult. With the advent of single-cell technologies, we have begun to appreciate the heterogenous nature of MPs in the TME and have seen that they are in a state of flux with high plasticity ( Gubin et al., 2018 41.

Mo can be divided into two main subsets: classical and non-classical ( Geissmann et al., 2003 35. Geissmann, F. ∙ Jung, S. ∙ Littman, D.R.

They may also affect tumor progression by differentiating into Mo-derived Macs or Mo-derived DCs in the TME. However, the signals that influence the fate of Mo in the TME have yet to be deciphered. Tumor-associated Macs are generally assumed to be tumor promoting ( Mantovani et al., 2017 62. Mantovani, A. ∙ Marchesi, F. ∙ Malesci, A. ... Tumour-associated macrophages as treatment targets in oncology Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2017; 14 :399-416 Crossref Scopus (1419) PubMed Google Scholar ). DCs, on the other hand, because of their exceptional antigen presentation capabilities, are thought to be beneficial for the antitumor response ( Binnewies et al., 2019 9.

It is now well appreciated that the gut microbiota affects anticancer immunity, controlling spontaneous tumor growth ( Arthur et al., 2012 4. Arthur, J.C. ∙ Perez-Chanona, E. ∙ Mühlbauer, M. ...

Recent studies have demonstrated associations between microbiota composition and response to ICB in individuals with cancer, and evidence suggests that use of antibiotics near the start of treatment can alter therapy efficacy ( Chalabi et al., 2020 18.

Gut microbiome influences efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy against epithelial tumors Science. 2018; 359 :91-97 Crossref Scopus (1904) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of microbiota action remain ill defined. In fact, most studies have looked at changes in T cell populations, and little is known about the effect of the microbiota on the intratumoral innate immune compartment. In particular, MPs, potent regulators of T cell responses, can be modulated by the microbiota at sites distant from the gut ( Gorjifard and Goldszmid, 2016 38. Gorjifard, S. ∙ Goldszmid, R.S. Microbiota-myeloid cell crosstalk beyond the gut J. Leukoc. Biol. 2016; 100 :865-879 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether the microbiota regulates the functional state of MPs in the TME and the signaling pathways involved are unknown.
In this study, we addressed this fundamental question using a combination of single-cell analysis, microbiota perturbation, and functional cell characterization in several preclinical cancer models. We reveal that microbiota-derived signals are needed to program MPs in the TME toward immunostimulatory Mo and DCs; absence of these signals shifts the MP repertoire toward tumor-promoting Macs. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that microbiota-derived stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists such as c-di-AMP induce type I interferon (IFN-I) production by intratumoral Mo, which regulates their skewing and natural killer (NK) cell-DC crosstalk. This mechanism can be triggered by microbiota manipulation with a high-fiber diet (FD) to improve the antitumor response. We show that Akkermansia muciniphila , enriched by FD, produces c-di-AMP and can mediate the FD phenotype. Importantly, we validated the translational relevance of our findings in individuals with melanoma treated with ICB. We show that transplantation of fecal microbiota from responder but not from non-responder individuals is sufficient to trigger IFN-I and remodel the innate immune TME. Our study uncovers a mechanism by which the microbiota regulates complex interactions among innate immune cells that can be harnessed to overcome the immunosuppressive TME.

Section: Results

To interrogate whether microbiota shapes MPs in the TME, we first took a reductionist approach, comparing EL4 lymphoma tumors implanted into normobiotic mice (specific pathogen free [SPF]) or animals raised germ free (GF). We sorted tumor MP populations as Lin neg CD11c hi MHCII hi , Lin neg Ly6C hi F4/80 low-neg , and Lin neg Ly6C int-low F4/80 pos and analyzed their transcriptional profile by NanoString ( Figure S1 A). We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of cells obtained from SPF tumors and corroborated that the predominant cell signatures in these clusters were DCs for the CD11c hi MHCII hi population, Mo for Ly6C hi F4/80 low-neg , and Mo-derived Macs for Ly6C int-low F4/80 pos ( Figure S1 B). When we compared the transcriptional profile of MPs from SPF and GF tumors, principal-component analysis (PCA) showed clear segregation among them, with CD11c hi MHCII hi cells being the farthest apart along PC1, which explains the most variance in the data ( Figures 1 A and S1 C).
Further characterization of the CD11c hi MHCII hi population by differential gene expression analysis confirmed the enrichment in DC signature genes (e.g., Flt3 , Cd209b , Zbtb46 , and Batf3 ) in cells from SPF tumors. In marked contrast, the same population obtained from GF display a strong pro-tumorigenic Mac signature (e.g., Mertk , Arg2 , C1qa , Apoe , Cd68 , Csf1r , Msr1 , and Trem2 ) ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). This skewing was also evidenced by the genes separating SPF and GF in the PCA of CD11c hi MHCII hi cells alone ( Figure S1 D) and the comparison of differentially expressed gene (DEG) clusters between SPF and GF with datasets from the Immunological Genome (ImmGen) Project ( Figures 1 B and S1 E). We also observed skewing toward protumor Macs in the Ly6C int-low F4/80 pos population from GF compared with SPF ( Table S1 ).
Prompted by the striking differences in bulk gene expression analysis between SPF and GF tumor-infiltrating MPs, we next performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of TME myeloid cells ( Figure S1 F; Table S2 ). Unsupervised clustering identified eight distinct MP clusters: three subsets of DCs (conventional DC1s and DC2s as well as a third population of DCs [Ccr7 hi DCs] that display high levels of Ccr7 , Cd40 , Cd86 , and Cd274 [PD-L1]), two clusters of classical Mo (Mo1 and Mo2), and three Mac clusters (Mac1, Mac2, and Mac3) ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 F–S1H). Trajectory analysis showed that along component 1, GF had a skewed cell distribution toward Macs, whereas SPF tumors were enriched in Mo and DCs ( Figures 1 E and 1F). We confirmed enrichment of the DC marker Flt3 in SPF tumor lysates via qRT-PCR ( Figure S1 I). In agreement with our NanoString data, further scRNA-seq analysis, including trajectories of Mo and Mac clusters only, showed an altered cell state in GF tumors that results in prevalence of Macs expressing canonical protumor genes such as Arg1 , Mrc1 (CD206), Trem2 , Retnla , C1qa , and Egr2 (Mac2/Mac3). Conversely, Macs in SPF (Mac1) tend to have an antitumor phenotype with higher levels of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) genes Il1b , Cd86 , Tlr2 , and Nos2 ( Figures 1 B, 1D, 1G, 1H, and S1 H).
Differential gene expression analysis between SPF and GF within each cell cluster revealed that common DEGs are regulated in a similar direction across different cell types within each group ( Figure 1 I). GSEA showed IFN alpha response among the top pathways enriched in Mac and DC populations from SPF compared with GF tumors ( Figure S2 A), and we confirmed that most MP populations from SPF contained a higher number of DEGs associated with IFN-I regulation than those from GF ( Figure S2 B). Additional pathway analysis showed that Mo and Mac clusters from SPF were enriched in pro-inflammatory pathways, whereas the same clusters from GF had elevated anti-inflammatory pathways ( Table S3 ). Likewise, when we analyzed DC2, the predominant DC cluster, cells from SPF were enriched in pathways associated with antitumor response, such as DC maturation and the Th1 pathway ( Figure 1 J). Contrarily, the DC2 cluster from GF tumors was enriched in pathways associated with immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory functions, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and PD-1/PD-L1 ( Figure 1 J). Our transcriptomics analysis showed that absence of microbiota results in impaired intratumoral IFN-I signaling and skewing of MPs toward suppressive Macs at the expense of stimulatory Mo and DCs.
The skewing revealed by our transcriptomics analysis was also observed by flow cytometry. We found a significant reduction in the frequency and absolute numbers of Mo (Lin neg Ly6C hi F4/80 low-neg ) and DCs (Lin neg CD11c + MHCII + CD64 neg CD24 +/++ FLT3 + ) infiltrating GF compared with SPF tumors ( Figures 2 A and S2 C). Importantly, this is not a GF-specific defect because using broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) to deplete the microbiota in SPF mice results in a similar phenotype ( Figure 2 B). Consistent with our scRNA-seq data, we found stark differences in Mac subset proportions between SPF and GF mice ( Figure 2 C). The Mac compartment in tumors from animals devoid of a microbiota was skewed toward a pro-tumorigenic phenotype with high CD206 and negative or low expression of MHCII ( Figures 2 C and 2D). We did not observe differences in DC proportions in the spleen or tumor-draining or inguinal lymph nodes from SPF and GF mice that were naive or tumor bearing ( Figures S2 D and S2E), agreeing with previous reports ( Ganal et al., 2012 34. Ganal, S.C. ∙ Sanos, S.L. ∙ Kallfass, C. ...

Cell Biol. 2008; 86 :200-205 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). This indicates a TME-specific rather than a generalized DC poiesis impairment in mice lacking microbiota.
Because the compositional complexity of the TME varies among tumor types, we extended our findings to three additional tumor models with clearly distinct TME immune composition: MC38 colon carcinoma and BP ( BRAF V600E / PTEN −/− ) melanoma in C57BL/6 mice and orthotopic TUBO mammary carcinoma in BALB/c mice ( Figure S2 F). Despite starting with a different TME immune repertoire, each of these tumors had significantly lower frequencies of Mo and DCs in the absence of microbiota ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Additionally, we found reduced expression of CD86 and MHCII on DCs from MC38 and TUBO tumors from GF or ABX mice, suggesting a less activated phenotype ( Figures S2 G and S2H). In line with the skewing observed in EL4, we found an increased pro/anti-tumorigenic Mac ratio in MC38 and BP and a similar trend in TUBO tumors from GF or ABX mice, indicative of a tumor-permissive environment ( Figure 2 G). These results help explain the inability of microbiota-devoid mice to respond to therapy ( Iida et al., 2013 47. Iida, N. ∙ Dzutsev, A. ∙ Stewart, C.A. ...

The intestinal microbiota modulates the anticancer immune effects of cyclophosphamide Science. 2013; 342 :971-976 Crossref Scopus (1012) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the consistency of our findings in several preclinical models, we conclude that the microbiota shapes the MP compartment in the TME.
We did not observe obvious differences in the tumor burden of SPF, GF, or ABX mice at the time of immunological analysis ( Figures S2 I and S2J). This agrees with previous findings from us and others showing that the growth of untreated tumors in mice with or without microbiota is comparable ( Iida et al., 2013 47.

Therefore, although physiological levels of microbiota-derived signals may not suffice to control spontaneous tumor growth, they are critical to program MPs for optimal response to cancer therapy.
To understand how the microbiota regulates MPs in the TME, we measured intratumoral cytokines and chemokines that might affect their function. EL4 tumor lysates from GF mice showed a marked reduction in proteins related to recruitment, maintenance, and function of Mo and DCs, such as CCL2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CXCL10, CCL5, interleukin-15 (IL-15)/IL-15R, IL-18, and IL-27 ( Figure 3 A). In line with our transcriptomics analysis ( Figures S2 A and S2B), type I IFNs were also decreased in tumors from GF mice at the protein (IFNα) and mRNA ( Ifnb1 ) levels ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). IFN-Is are important for antitumor response ( Diamond et al., 2011 27. Diamond, M.S. ∙ Kinder, M. ∙ Matsushita, H. ...

Immunol. 2015; 15 :405-414 Crossref Scopus (551) PubMed Google Scholar ), and previous studies have suggested that MPs require microbiota signals to produce IFN-I following viral infection ( Abt et al., 2012 1.

Priming of natural killer cells by nonmucosal mononuclear phagocytes requires instructive signals from commensal microbiota Immunity. 2012; 37 :171-186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we surmise that the microbiota can regulate IFN-I production in the TME, generating a pro-inflammatory environment that favors antitumor immunity.
If IFN-I signaling is a critical step in the microbiota’s effect on TME immune status, then we would predict that absence of IFN-I should result in a similar remodeling of the TME as the absence of microbiota. We therefore characterized the immune protein and cellular infiltration profiles of EL4 tumors from wild-type (WT) or IFN-I receptor-deficient animals ( Ifnar1 −/− ) and compared them with GF. We found that the intratumoral cytokine/chemokine profile of Ifnar1 −/− mice resembles that of GF ( Figures 3 B and S3 B). Moreover, Ifnar1 −/− mice displayed an altered TME MP repertoire with reduced Mo and DCs coupled with a skewing toward protumor Macs, as observed in GF ( Figures 3 C and S3 C). Characterization of DC subsets in the TME showed that cDC1s, which have an essential role in antitumor immunity ( Barry et al., 2018 6. Barry, K.C. ∙ Hsu, J. ∙ Broz, M.L. ...

Immunol. 2020; 20 :7-24 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ), were decreased in Ifnar1 −/− compared with WT tumors ( Figure 3 C). Similarly, mice without microbiota harboring EL4, MC38, or TUBO tumors had reduced cDC1s compared with SPF ( Figures S3 D and S3E). The reduced levels of IFNs and IFN-regulated genes in GF tumors, together with the remarkable similarities in cytokine/chemokine profiles and the MP repertoire between Ifnar1 −/− and microbiota-deficient mice, support our hypothesis that IFN-I is an important host factor mediating the microbiota’s effect on the TME.
An important consequence of the remodeled TME in the absence of microbiota is loss of therapy efficacy. To study whether the same TME remodeling that resulted from absence of IFN-I signaling also affects response to therapy, we used oxaliplatin (oxa), a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the clinic that has been shown to require microbiota signals and myeloid cells for its efficacy ( He et al., 2021 44. He, Y. ∙ Fu, L. ∙ Li, Y. ...

Commensal bacteria control cancer response to therapy by modulating the tumor microenvironment Science. 2013; 342 :967-970 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that Ifnar1 −/− mice display an impaired response to oxa ( Figure 3 D) akin to that of ABX ( Figure S3 F) or GF ( Iida et al., 2013 47. Iida, N. ∙ Dzutsev, A. ∙ Stewart, C.A. ... Commensal bacteria control cancer response to therapy by modulating the tumor microenvironment Science. 2013; 342 :967-970 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, WT mice given an anti-IFNAR1 neutralizing antibody also showed a blunted response to oxa ( Figure S3 G), confirming that, similarly to microbial signals, IFN-I signaling is required for an optimal response. STING, a major regulator of IFN-I production, has been shown to play an important role in the response to immuno- and radiotherapy ( Deng et al., 2014 25. Deng, L. ∙ Liang, H. ∙ Xu, M. ...

STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing mediates innate immune recognition of immunogenic tumors Immunity. 2014; 41 :830-842 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (780) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore wanted to find out whether STING, which can be activated by microbial ligands, is also required for chemotherapy efficacy. Indeed, STING deficiency ( Tmem173 −/− ) resulted in a comparably impaired response to oxa as the absence of Ifnar1 or microbiota signaling ( Figure 3 E). These results suggest that the microbiota effect on therapy efficacy occurs at least in part via IFN-I induction.
We next sought to determine the cellular circuits downstream of the microbiota-induced IFN-I pathway involved in remodeling of the TME. Our protein data analysis showed that GF and Ifnar1 −/− tumors had significantly lower amounts of IFN-inducible proteins critical for NK cell recruitment and activation, such as CXCL10, CCL5, IL-15/IL-15R, and IL-18 ( Figures 3 A and S3 B). Thus, we hypothesized that, without microbiota, deficient IFN-I signaling in the TME results in reduced content and impaired function of NK cells. Accordingly, we found a marked reduction in NK cell frequency in the TME of Ifnar1 −/− as well as microbiota-devoid mice ( Figures 3 F and 3G). NK cells have been identified as regulators of cDC1 abundance in the TME ( Barry et al., 2018 6. Barry, K.C. ∙ Hsu, J. ∙ Broz, M.L. ... A natural killer-dendritic cell axis defines checkpoint therapy-responsive tumor microenvironments Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1178-1191 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ; Böttcher et al., 2018 11. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Bonavita, E. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... NK Cells Stimulate Recruitment of cDC1 into the Tumor Microenvironment Promoting Cancer Immune Control Cell. 2018; 172 :1022-1037.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ), in part via production of DC chemoattractants. Hence, NK cell impairment would explain the hampered DC recruitment in the absence of microbial signals. To confirm this, we performed additional scRNA-seq of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes ( Figure S3 H; Table S4 ) and found that NK cells are the main producers of the DC-recruiting chemokines Xcl1 and Ccl5 as well as the DC differentiation and survival factor Csf2 (GM-CSF) in EL4 tumors ( Figure S3 I). Flow cytometry confirmed that NK cells are the primary source of Ccl5 in these tumors ( Figure S3 J). We also observed a significant positive correlation between NK cells and DCs in EL4, MC38, and TUBO tumors ( Figure S3 K). Supporting our hypothesis, we found that the Xcl1 transcript as well as CCL5 and GM-CSF proteins were diminished in GF tumor lysates ( Figures 3 A and 3H) and that NK cells from GF tumors produce less Xcl1 compared with SPF ( Figure 3 I).
We compared the transcriptional profile of NK cells from SPF and GF tumors and found that NK cells from SPF have an activated phenotype with higher expression of genes encoding effector proteins ( Gzmb , Serpinb9b , Ifng , Cxcl10 , and Xcl1 ) and transcription factors known to regulate NK cell function and homeostasis ( Ikzf2 and Klf2 ). In contrast, NK cells from GF expressed higher levels of the gene encoding for transforming growth factor β-induced protein ( Tgfbi ), compatible with a pro-tumorigenic environment ( Cantelli et al., 2017 17. Cantelli, G. ∙ Crosas-Molist, E. ∙ Georgouli, M. ... TGFΒ-induced transcription in cancer Semin. Cancer Biol. 2017; 42 :60-69 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 J). IFNγ was also reduced significantly in tumor lysates from GF mice ( Figure 3 A). Validating the scRNA-seq and protein data, we observed that NK cells from GF tumors were impaired in their ability to produce IFNγ ( Figure S3 L). From these observations, we conclude that microbiota-induced IFN-I signaling in the TME results in effective recruitment and activation of NK cells, which, via production of CCL5 and XCL1, recruit DCs. In response to IFN-I, these DCs produce Il15 / Il15ra ( Figures 3 A and S3 I), which support and activate NK cells ( Burkett et al., 2004 14. Burkett, P.R. ∙ Koka, R. ∙ Chien, M. ...

Med. 2008; 205 :1213-1225 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ), triggering a positive feedback loop to promote antitumor immunity.
Our data show that the microbiota regulates the IFN-I-NK cell-DC axis in the TME and that, like microbial signals, IFN-I and STING signaling are required for optimal response to therapy ( Figures 3 D, 3E, S3 F, and S3G). Additionally, previous studies have shown that STING-mediated IFN-I signaling can potentiate antitumoral effects of NK cells ( Marcus et al., 2018 63. Marcus, A. ∙ Mao, A.J. ∙ Lensink-Vasan, M. ... Tumor-Derived cGAMP Triggers a STING-Mediated Interferon Response in Non-tumor Cells to Activate the NK Cell Response Immunity. 2018; 49 :754-763.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nicolai et al., 2020 70. Nicolai, C.J. ∙ Wolf, N. ∙ Chang, I.C. ... NK cells mediate clearance of CD8 + T cell-resistant tumors in response to STING agonists Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 :eaaz2738 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, we reasoned that microbiota-derived STING agonists such as cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) would be able to regulate the IFN-I-NK cell-DC axis in the TME. To test this, we stimulated total tumor-infiltrating cells ex vivo with the bacterial CDN cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP [cdAMP]) and measured the Ifnb1 transcript by flow cytometry. We identified classical Mo as the main source of IFN-I in the TME in response to cdAMP ( Figure 3 K). Moreover, cdAMP-induced IFN-I production resulted in increased Xcl1 and Ccl5 expression by intratumoral NK cells ( Figure 3 L). Mo were also among the major producers of the IFN-inducible chemokines Ccl2 and Cxcl10 (important for their own recruitment and that of other leukocytes) as well as of the NK cell-activating cytokine Il18 ( Figure S3 I). Interestingly, NanoString analysis of MPs sorted from SPF or GF tumors showed that cells from GF express higher levels of Atf3 ( Table S1 ), a transcriptional repressor of IFNβ production and known negative regulator of inflammatory responses ( Labzin et al., 2015 51. Labzin, L.I. ∙ Schmidt, S.V. ∙ Masters, S.L. ... ATF3 Is a Key Regulator of Macrophage IFN Responses J. Immunol. 2015; 195 :4446-4455 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed the impaired ability of Mo from GF tumors to produce Ifnb1 ( Figure 3 M), which explains the reduced IFN-I protein, dysfunctional NK cells, decreased DCs, and blunted antitumor response observed in these animals.
To rescue the IFN-I signaling deficiency in the TME of GF mice and to validate our findings with cdAMP in vivo , we used a gain-of-function approach mimicking the potential systemic effect of this microbiota-derived product ( Figure 3 N). Administration of cdAMP to GF animals resulted in increased intratumoral levels of IFN-I genes and a trend toward higher Xcl1 ( Figure S4 A). More importantly, it restored Mo and DC infiltration ( Figure 3 O). Additionally, PCA of Mac populations showed that Macs in the TME of cdAMP-treated GF resemble those from SPF mice ( Figure S4 B). Conversely, cdAMP injection into SPF mice had no effect on Mo or DC infiltration, indicating that the effect observed in GF is likely due to restoration of a microbiota-mediated mechanism ( Figure S4 C). Our results demonstrate that systemic microbiota-derived products, such as the STING agonist cdAMP, regulate innate immune cell interactions in the TME and antitumor responses via IFN-I.
Different gut microbiota compositions have been associated with response to cancer therapy ( Sepich-Poore et al., 2021 81. Sepich-Poore, G.D. ∙ Zitvogel, L. ∙ Straussman, R. ... The microbiome and human cancer Science. 2021; 371 :eabc4552 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we next moved to a more translational and actionable approach to manipulate, but not ablate, gut microbes using dietary intervention or single ABX. SPF mice were fed different diets or received single ABX in drinking water starting before tumor implantation ( Figure S4 D). We found that EL4 tumors from animals fed a high-fiber diet (FD), which has been associated with lower cancer risk ( Trock et al., 1990 92. Trock, B. ∙ Lanza, E. ∙ Greenwald, P. Dietary fiber, vegetables, and colon cancer: critical review and meta-analyses of the epidemiologic evidence J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82 :650-661 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), had an increased frequency and absolute numbers of total DCs and cDC1s compared with mice fed a control diet ( Figures 4 A, S4 E, and S4F). Furthermore, the FD resulted in better spontaneous tumor growth control ( Figures 4 B and 4C), in line with a recent study ( Li et al., 2020a 55. Li, Y. ∙ Elmen, L. ∙ Segota, I. ... Prebiotic-Induced Anti-tumor Immunity Attenuates Tumor Growth Cell Rep. 2020; 30 :1753-1766.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). A Western diet (WD), high in fats and sugars, has been associated with increased cancer risk ( Fabiani et al., 2016 30. Fabiani, R. ∙ Minelli, L. ∙ Bertarelli, G. ... A Western Dietary Pattern Increases Prostate Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Nutrients. 2016; 8 :626 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiao et al., 2019 99. Xiao, Y. ∙ Xia, J. ∙ Li, L. ... Associations between dietary patterns and the risk of breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies Breast Cancer Res. 2019; 21 :16 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrary to the FD, mice fed the WD had reduced tumor-infiltrating DC (tiDC) numbers and increased tumor size compared with the control diet ( Figures S4 G and S4H). Additionally, we found that perturbing the microbiota with a narrow-ranged antibiotic (vancomycin) can result in reduced tiDCs and cDC1s ( Figures S4 I).
We confirmed the ability of the FD to remodel intratumoral MPs using the MC38 model. MC38 tumors from FD mice had increased DCs and Mo as well as reduced Macs, which also resulted in an improved spontaneous antitumor response ( Figures 4 D–4H). More importantly, the FD significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatments ( Figures 4 I and 4J). Our results show that microbiota manipulation can alter the innate landscape of the TME, particularly DC content, and, in turn, modulate antitumor immunity.
We then focused on the FD for its potential clinical applications. We performed fecal matter transplantation (FMT) from control or FD-fed mice into GF animals and confirmed that the beneficial anticancer effect of the FD was indeed mediated by the microbiota ( Figure S5 A). We next interrogated the involvement of the IFN-I-NK cell axis in FD-induced remodeling of the TME. We found higher levels of IFN-I genes, a higher proportion of Ifnb1 -producing Mo, and increased Xcl1 expression by NK cells in tumors from FD-fed mice compared with control diet-fed mice ( Figures 5 A and S5 B). Additionally, Mo from FD tumors produced more Ifnb1 in response to cdAMP ( Figure S5 C). These results provide an explanation for the augmented DC content and enhanced antitumor response in FD-fed mice, further supporting our hypothesis that the microbiota regulates the TME innate immune profile via IFN-I.
To evaluate changes in microbiota composition induced by the FD, we performed fecal 16S rRNA sequencing using mice obtained from the same vendor but bred in two different facilities (Maryland [MD] or New York [NY]). Feeding the FD was sufficient to overcome the initial facility differences and resulted in similar microbiota compositions ( Figure 5 B). Mice fed the FD had reduced alpha diversity, increased relative abundance of the phyla Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria, and reduced Firmicutes compared with control diet-fed mice ( Figures 5 C, S5 D, and S5E). Additionally, FD-fed animals were enriched in order-level taxa such as Enterobacteriales, Verrucomicrobiales, and Betaproteobacteriales and reduced in Clostridiales and Lactobacillales ( Figure S5 F). Among 333 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), we found 17 differentially abundant microbes (DAMs) higher in FD-fed animals and 64 DAMs higher in control diet-fed animals, consistent across three independent experiments ( Figures S5 G and S5H; Table S5 ). Next we employed transkingdom network analysis ( Rodrigues et al., 2018 77. Rodrigues, R.R. ∙ Shulzhenko, N. ∙ Morgun, A. Transkingdom Networks: A Systems Biology Approach to Identify Causal Members of Host-Microbiota Interactions Methods Mol. Biol. 2018; 1849 :227-242 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) to construct a correlation network using DAMs altered by the FD prior to tumor implantation to predict DC infiltration and tumor burden. We created a transkingdom network whose largest connected component consisted of 13 microbial nodes and 4 phenotypic nodes ( Figure 5 D). ASVs from the genera Akkermansia , Escherichia-Shigella , and Enterococcus positively correlated with cDC1 and cDC2 infiltration, whereas Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with the same cell populations. Moreover, Akkermansia negatively correlated with tumor burden ( Figure 5 D), which is in agreement with studies associating the presence of Akkermansia with better tumor control ( Li et al., 2020a 55. Li, Y. ∙ Elmen, L. ∙ Segota, I. ... Prebiotic-Induced Anti-tumor Immunity Attenuates Tumor Growth Cell Rep. 2020; 30 :1753-1766.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Routy et al., 2018 78. Routy, B. ∙ Le Chatelier, E. ∙ Derosa, L. ... Gut microbiome influences efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy against epithelial tumors Science. 2018; 359 :91-97 Crossref Scopus (1904) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We then wanted to find out whether specific microbes were sufficient to induce the immune changes in the TME. To identify causal microbes of the FD phenotype, we used bipartite betweenness centrality (BiBC) analysis ( Dong et al., 2015 28. Dong, X. ∙ Yambartsev, A. ∙ Ramsey, S.A. ... Reverse enGENEering of Regulatory Networks from Big Data: A Roadmap for Biologists Bioinform. Biol. Insights. 2015; 9 :61-74 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). This analysis is a way of measuring the influence of an individual node (e.g., microbe) in the network, allowing us to identify microbial regulators of tumor immune phenotypes independent of their relative abundance. We found that Akkermansia had the highest BiBC score ( Figure 5 E), which places it as the top microbial candidate to mediate the DC and tumor growth phenotypes regulated by the FD. To test the predicted modulatory effects of Akkermansia in this system, we monocolonized GF mice with Akkermansia muciniphila ( Akk ) before tumor implantation (GF+ Akk ). We found a significant increase in tiDCs, a clear trend toward higher cDC1s, and a significant reduction in the pro/antitumor Mac ratio in GF+ Akk compared with GF mice ( Figure 5 F). In addition, Akk improved tumor growth control, as observed in SPF animals fed the FD ( Figures 5 G). Compared with Akk , monocolonization of GF animals with Lactobacillus reuteri led to lower intratumoral cDC1 content, a higher pro/antitumor Mac ratio, and worsening of tumor growth control ( Figure S5 I), supporting our predictions from the transkingdom network analysis.
The data above shows that Akk favorably remodels the TME. Our model would predict that this occurs via the STING-IFN-I pathway. To test this, we first evaluated the ability of Akk to produce CDNs. To do so, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure bacterially derived CDNs (cdAMP, c-di-guanosine monophosphate [cdGMP], and c-GAMP). We found that Akk produced all three CDNs in culture, but cdAMP was the dominant molecular entity ( Figure 5 H). We next analyzed mouse cecum content from SPF, GF, or GF+ Akk . As expected, the three CDNs were present in samples from SPF mice, whereas none could be detected in GF mice ( Figure 5 I). Notably, monocolonization of GF mice with Akk rescued cdAMP levels close to those found in SPF mice with little to no change in cdGMP and c-GAMP ( Figure 5 I), confirming that Akk predominantly produces cdAMP in vivo as well.
To test the biological activity of Akk -derived cdAMP and its potential to induce IFN-I, we co-cultured Akk or its spent medium with STING-IRF3 reporter cells in the presence or absence of a selective STING inhibitor. Heat-killed Akk and the spent supernatant induced STING-mediated IRF3 activation ( Figure 5 J). We then investigated whether, as in the case of the FD, Akk also modulates the IFN-I-NK cell axis in the TME in vivo . We found that GF+ Akk had higher frequency of Ifnb1 -producing Mo and increased Xcl1 expression by NK cells in the TME. Moreover, Akk monocolonization improved the impaired response of GF mice to oxa, which, as we showed, depends on IFN-I and STING signaling ( Figures 5 K and S5 J). These results provide a direct link between the presence of Akk and activation of the IFN-I-NK cell-DC axis in the TME to promote antitumor responses.
Recent studies have indicated that the microbiota affects the response to ICB in individuals with cancer ( Sepich-Poore et al., 2021 81. Sepich-Poore, G.D. ∙ Zitvogel, L. ∙ Straussman, R. ... The microbiome and human cancer Science. 2021; 371 :eabc4552 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), but how this happens has not been shown. Therefore, to determine the translational relevance of our findings, we analyzed the innate immune signatures predicted from our preclinical studies in whole-tumor RNA-seq data from a discovery cohort of individuals with melanoma treated with ICB ( Helmink et al., 2020 45. Helmink, B.A. ∙ Reddy, S.M. ∙ Gao, J. ... B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures promote immunotherapy response Nature. 2020; 577 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with our data, we found a highly significant positive correlation between IFN-I gene signature and the signatures for classical Mo, NK cells, and DCs ( Figure 6 A). In addition, we observed a significant positive correlation between the signatures for NK cells and DCs ( Figure 6 A). Also, the gene signature for NK cells and the DC-recruiting chemokines ( XCL1 , XCL2, and CCL5 ) positively correlated with each other and with the signature for cDC1s ( Figure S6 A), which agrees with previous reports ( Barry et al., 2018 6. Barry, K.C. ∙ Hsu, J. ∙ Broz, M.L. ... A natural killer-dendritic cell axis defines checkpoint therapy-responsive tumor microenvironments Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1178-1191 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ; Böttcher et al., 2018 11. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Bonavita, E. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... NK Cells Stimulate Recruitment of cDC1 into the Tumor Microenvironment Promoting Cancer Immune Control Cell. 2018; 172 :1022-1037.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next interrogated how these correlations related to response to therapy. Remarkably, the gene signatures for the cell types and cytokines/chemokines we found to be decreased significantly in mice lacking microbiota were reduced similarly in non-responder (NR) as compared to responder (R) tumors: classical Mo, IFN-I, NK cells, chemokines ( XCL1 , XCL2 , and CCL5 ), DCs, cDC1s, IL-15/IL-15RA , IL-18 , and IFNG ( Figures 6 B and S6 B). In addition, we found that NR individuals had a reduced CD8 T cell signature compared with R individuals and that intratumoral cDC1 and CD8 T cell signatures positively correlated with each other ( Figures S6 A and S6C). CIBERSORT analysis to infer immune cell proportions showed enrichment in Macs in the TME from NR individuals ( Figure S6 D).
We observed similar results in a larger validation cohort of individuals with advanced melanoma treated with ICB ( Liu et al., 2019 57. Liu, D. ∙ Schilling, B. ∙ Liu, D. ... Integrative molecular and clinical modeling of clinical outcomes to PD1 blockade in patients with metastatic melanoma Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1916-1927 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 6 C, S6 E, and S6F). Moreover, we found that high expression of the following gene signatures was associated significantly with improved overall survival after treatment: classical Mo, IFN-I, chemokines, DCs, cDC1s, and IL15RA ( Figures 6 D and S6 G). Although higher expression of the NK cell signature was not associated significantly with better survival, we observed association with the chemokines produced by them, emphasizing the importance of NK cell function ( Figures 6 D and S6 G). The qualitative differences we observed in the TME of R and NR individuals are recapitulated fully in our preclinical models, supporting the notion that the microbiota influences an individual’s response to ICB by reprogramming the innate immune TME.
To establish a causal relationship between the TME immune compositional differences of R and NR individuals and the microbiota, we performed FMT, giving feces from individuals with melanoma treated with ICB to GF mice. Samples from three R and three NR donors were transferred individually into different GF cohorts before implantation with BP melanoma ( Figure 7 A). Mo in the TME of animals receiving R FMT acquired a stimulatory phenotype and differentiated into inflammatory Macs, characterized by high levels of MHCII and intermediate F4/80 and CD68 expression (Mo2 and Mac1), resembling those observed in SPF. Conversely, mice receiving NR FMT showed skewing of MPs toward Macs expressing low MHCII and high levels of F4/80, CD68, and PDL1 (Mo3 and Mac2) ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S7 A), similar to GF ( Figures 1 C–1H and 2 C–2G). NR FMT mice also had significantly reduced intratumoral DCs and Mo, an increased pro/antitumor Mac ratio, and a trend toward decreased NK cells ( Figures 7 D, 7E, and S7 B), as we observed in GF and Ifnar1 −/− animals. Furthermore, NR FMT tumors had reduced Ifnb1 expression ( Figure 7 E). This TME remodeling ultimately resulted in poor tumor growth control in NR FMT compared with R FMT mice ( Figure 7 F). These results support a cause-effect relationship between the microbiota, intratumoral IFN-I, and response to ICB.
To further corroborate this causal relationship, we analyzed RNA-seq data from a phase I clinical trial in which individuals with anti-PD-1-refractory metastatic melanoma received FMT from individuals who had achieved complete response followed by re-induction of anti-PD-1 ( Baruch et al., 2021 7. Baruch, E.N. ∙ Youngster, I. ∙ Ben-Betzalel, G. ... Fecal microbiota transplant promotes response in immunotherapy-refractory melanoma patients Science. 2021; 371 :602-609 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). We compared tumors from individuals who responded to this treatment (trial-R) to those that did not respond (trial-NR) and examined the differences induced by microbiota transplantation (before and after FMT). In line with our preclinical data, GSEA showed IFN alpha response as one of the top pathways upregulated after FMT in trial-R individuals ( Figures 7 G and S7 C). Moreover, the gene signatures for Mo, IFN-I, NK cells, chemokines, DCs, cDC1s, IL-15/IL-15RA , and CD8 T cells were higher in trial-R after but not before FMT ( Figures 7 H and S7 D). Relative to baseline levels (before FMT), these signatures increased after FMT in trial-R tumors but remained unchanged in trial-NR ( Figure 7 I). In contrast to tumors, we found no differences before and after FMT or between trial-R and trial-NR individuals when we looked at the same signatures in gut samples from these individuals ( Figures S7 E and S7F), confirming the tumor-specific microbiota effect. Interestingly, Akk , which mediated the IFN-I and immune phenotype in mice, showed a trend toward increased abundance in post-FMT fecal samples from trial-R compared with trial-NR individuals ( Figure S7 G). This concurs with another clinical trial with a similar FMT-ICB design in which Akk was also associated with response to ICB after FMT ( Davar et al., 2021 23. Davar, D. ∙ Dzutsev, A.K. ∙ McCulloch, J.A. ... Fecal microbiota transplant overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients Science. 2021; 371 :595-602 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings provide a strong causal link between the microbiota, the intratumoral IFN-I-NK cell-DC axis, and response to ICB in individuals with cancer.

Section: Discussion

There is abundant evidence that the microbiota affects the immune response to cancer ( Sepich-Poore et al., 2021 81. Sepich-Poore, G.D. ∙ Zitvogel, L. ∙ Straussman, R. ... The microbiome and human cancer Science. 2021; 371 :eabc4552 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our mechanistic understanding is incomplete, particularly because studies often explore other tissues, such as lymph nodes, the spleen, or the gut, which may not necessarily reflect intratumoral occurrences. This lack of knowledge has hampered the development of microbiota-targeted therapies. Here we uncovered a mechanism by which the microbiota shapes the TME innate immune landscape to regulate antitumor immunity. We demonstrate the following: (1) microbiota-derived STING agonists (e.g., cdAMP) induce IFN-I production by intratumoral Mo, which triggers antitumor skewing of the TME; (2) these Mo regulate recruitment and activation of NK cells and subsequent NK cell-DC crosstalk; (3) when the microbiota is disrupted unfavorably, the Mo-IFN-I-NK cell-DC cascade is halted, and Mo differentiate into protumor Macs; (4) microbiota modulation with FD, monocolonization with cdAMP-producing A. muciniphila , or systemic administration of cdAMP are sufficient to trigger this IFN-I pathway and improve the antitumor response; and (5) transplantation of microbiota from ICB R individuals induces intratumoral IFN-I, remodels the TME, and favors response to ICB.
We found that Mo, via IFN-I production, are key regulators of innate immune cell dynamics in the TME, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets to improve anticancer immunity. Interestingly, in non-cancer studies, IFN-I has also emerged as an important host factor mediating microbiota-immune interactions. However, unlike our observations in tumors, some reports in other physiological contexts identified plasmacytoid DCs as microbiota-sensing and IFN-I-producing cells via different signaling pathways ( Antunes et al., 2019 2.

Although it remains unexplored, it is possible that other commensal-derived products may also play a role in regulating IFN-I in cancer. Our results and these studies highlight the plasticity of MPs that can respond to different microbiota-derived components activating a variety of signaling pathways.
Our findings from preclinical models as well as RNA-seq analysis of the FMT clinical trial show that microbiota-induced changes observed in the TME are not reflected in other tissues. Also, we show that systemic administration of a microbiota-derived STING agonist can specifically elicit changes in the TME. Nevertheless, the location where microbial sensing occurs remains unknown. Several non-mutually exclusive scenarios are possible: sensing in the bone marrow at the precursor level, in the periphery (gut, circulation), or in the tumor itself. It has become increasingly apparent that tumors distant from the gut harbor their own microbiota ( Nejman et al., 2020 68. Nejman, D. ∙ Livyatan, I. ∙ Fuks, G. ... The human tumor microbiome is composed of tumor type-specific intracellular bacteria Science. 2020; 368 :973-980 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with this, it has been shown that Bifidobacterium colonizes subcutaneous mouse tumors and promotes IFN-I production in response to anti-CD47 treatment ( Shi et al., 2020b 84. Shi, Y. ∙ Zheng, W. ∙ Yang, K. ... Intratumoral accumulation of gut microbiota facilitates CD47-based immunotherapy via STING signaling J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20192282 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a different report, intratumoral administration of CDNs resulted in IFN-I-induced NK cell activation ( Nicolai et al., 2020 70. Nicolai, C.J. ∙ Wolf, N. ∙ Chang, I.C. ... NK cells mediate clearance of CD8 + T cell-resistant tumors in response to STING agonists Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 :eaaz2738 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). These two studies suggest that intratumoral sensing of the microbiota may occur. Although each of these scenarios could be acting independently, they may also work in conjunction, where systemic sensing initially programs target cells and local signaling amplifies the effects.
Specific antitumor effects of the microbiota have been associated with changes in T cell activation and/or recruitment into the tumor or tumor-draining lymph nodes ( Matson et al., 2018 64. Matson, V. ∙ Fessler, J. ∙ Bao, R. ...

Some studies have shown direct effects of microbiota-derived metabolites on T cells ( He et al., 2021 44. He, Y. ∙ Fu, L. ∙ Li, Y. ... Gut microbial metabolites facilitate anticancer therapy efficacy by modulating cytotoxic CD8 + T cell immunity Cell Metab. 2021; 33 :988-1000.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mager et al., 2020 60. Mager, L.F. ∙ Burkhard, R. ∙ Pett, N. ... Microbiome-derived inosine modulates response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy Science. 2020; 369 :1481-1489 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, these effects were still reliant on MPs (e.g., costimulation, antigen presentation, cytokines) for improved therapy efficacy. This observation underscores the importance of MPs even if microbial products can directly enhance antitumor T cell function. However, what regulates MP function in the TME has remained unclear. Thus, our findings regarding how the microbiota regulates intratumoral MPs fill a crucial knowledge gap not only in our understanding of the role of the microbiota in antitumor immunity but also the cues that control MPs.
Microbial taxa associated with response to ICB in individuals with cancer differ among different reports ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018 37. Gopalakrishnan, V. ∙ Spencer, C.N. ∙ Nezi, L. ... Gut microbiome modulates response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients Science. 2018; 359 :97-103 Crossref Scopus (1626) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matson et al., 2018 64. Matson, V. ∙ Fessler, J. ∙ Bao, R. ... The commensal microbiome is associated with anti-PD-1 efficacy in metastatic melanoma patients Science. 2018; 359 :104-108 Crossref Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ; Routy et al., 2018 78.

Gut microbiome influences efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy against epithelial tumors Science. 2018; 359 :91-97 Crossref Scopus (1904) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is likely that the microbiota effect is not dependent on single species and that diverse microbiota compositions as well as several microbially derived products may result in the same downstream immunomodulatory effect. We demonstrate here that dietary manipulation of the microbiota offers a clinically actionable approach to reprogram the TME. Feeding mice a diet enriched in the fiber pectin increased IFN-I production and altered intratumoral MPs to improve tumor growth control and ICB efficacy. In agreement with our observations, two recent abstracts suggested that fiber-rich diets were associated with better post-therapy clinical outcomes in individuals with cancer (C.N. Spencer et al., 2019, AACR, abstract; C. Richard et al., 2020, SITC, abstract). Notably, several bacterial taxa that have been linked to better ICB response in affected individuals (e.g., Faecalibacterium , Enterococcus hirae , and Bacteroides fragilis ) are known to hydrolyze pectin ( Tan and Nie, 2020 89. Tan, H. ∙ Nie, S. Deciphering diet-gut microbiota-host interplay: Investigations of pectin Trends Food Sci. Technol. 2020; 106 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ). Pectin has been shown to stimulate secretion of mucin in the gut ( Popov et al., 2006 73. Popov, S.V. ∙ Ovodova, R.G. ∙ Markov, P.A. ... Protective effect of comaruman, a pectin of cinquefoil Comarum palustre L., on acetic acid-induced colitis in mice Dig. Dis. Sci. 2006; 51 :1532-1537 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), and feeding mucin to mice can reduce the tumor burden ( Li et al., 2020a 55. Li, Y. ∙ Elmen, L. ∙ Segota, I. ... Prebiotic-Induced Anti-tumor Immunity Attenuates Tumor Growth Cell Rep. 2020; 30 :1753-1766.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with those findings, we found that mucin-degrading Akkermansia , predicted by our network analysis and associated previously with ICB response in affected individuals, produces cdAMP and can recapitulate the FD phenotype. Although studies have described local (i.e., gut) and systemic effects of dietary fiber ( Tan and Nie, 2020 89. Tan, H. ∙ Nie, S. Deciphering diet-gut microbiota-host interplay: Investigations of pectin Trends Food Sci. Technol. 2020; 106 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ), these mechanisms remain to be explored in depth in cancer. Nevertheless, evidence suggests synergism between fiber and predicted bacterial regulators of response to treatment, which can be leveraged as pre- or probiotics to enhance therapy efficacy.
We found that the microbiota tailored the TME MP network in several tumor models with distinct immune contextures, pointing to a general mechanism of microbiota immune regulation in cancer. More importantly, we extended our findings to individuals with melanoma and showed not only that the same innate immune signatures are associated with ICB response but also that FMT from affected individuals into mice is sufficient to induce IFN-I and recapitulate the immune compositional differences between R and NR individuals. Analysis of clinical samples from the FMT-ICB trial confirmed that IFN-I induction and the compositional differences transferred by the microbiota influence therapy efficacy in affected individuals. These observations provide strong evidence supporting a causal link between the microbiota, IFN-I, and response to ICB.
The consistency of our findings across several models as well as tumors from affected individuals suggests that IFN-I and Mo skewing lie at the root of the immune dysregulation that occurs in tumors and reveals a key role of the microbiota in orchestrating this process. One of the most daunting obstacles to effecting a response to cancer therapy is overcoming the immunosuppressive TME. Our study provides important insights into the mechanism by which the microbiota programs the antitumor TME and will improve our ability to leverage the microbiota in the design of cancer therapies.
An important question that remains unanswered in our study is where MPs receive microbiota-derived signals. We were unable to detect measurable levels of CDNs in tumors. This could be due to levels being below the detection limit of our method, rapid uptake by host cells, or absence in the tumor. Although we focused on MPs, future studies should evaluate the relative contribution of myeloid versus lymphoid cells in microbiota-mediated antitumor effects. While we demonstrate here that the microbiota regulates the IFN-I-NK cell-DC axis in the TME, the limited availability of paired gut microbiome and tumor RNA-seq datasets made it difficult to establish strong associations between specific microbes and IFN-I phenotype in affected individuals. It will be important to extend our findings to larger cohorts across tumor types. Despite these limitations, our study significantly expands our knowledge of microbiota regulation of antitumor immunity and ties together elements associated with anticancer response into a holistic microbiota-orchestrated mechanism that can be harnessed to improve therapy efficacy.

C57BL/6NTac germ-free (GF) mice were bred and maintained in the Gnotobiotics Facility of the Laboratory Animal Sciences Program of the Frederick National Laboratory. C57BL/6NTac specific-pathogen-free (SPF) controls were obtained from Taconic Farms Inc. BALB/cAnNCrl and B6-Ly5.1/Cr mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (CRL). B6-Ifnar1 (Ifnar1 KO) and C57BL/6J-Tmem173/J (STING KO) mice and their respective wild-type controls were bred and maintained in a specific pathogen free environment in the Cancer and Inflammation Program Core at the NCI Frederick. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Cancer Institute and were conducted in accordance with the IACUC guidelines and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 8 to 10-weeks-old mice from both genders were randomly distributed into the experimental groups for this study. Chow and drinking water were provided to mice ab libitum. When not specified and for control of modified diets, mice were fed NIH-31 Open Formula Autoclavable diet. For the patient fecal matter transplant (FMT) experiment performed at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. B6 germ-free mice were purchased from and transported by the gnotobiotic facility of Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). Mice were housed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center gnotobiotic mouse facility.
For patient fecal sample collection, six stage IV M1a-d melanoma patients seen at the University of Texas MD Anderson gave informed consent during their clinic visit. IRB protocol PA15-0232 was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board IRB1 Office of Protocol Research at the University of Texas MD Anderson in accordance with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) Policy for Continuing Review of Research and the federal regulations governing human subjects research [45 CFR 46.109(e) and 21 CFR 56.109(f)]. All patients received immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment. Response was defined as achieving complete response or partial response by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Three responder (R) and three non-responder (NR) patients were used as donors for fecal matter transplant in this study. Mean age 60.6 years (49-76). Gender: female/male 3/3 (50/50%). Mean BMI 28.16 kg/m 2 (22-41). Stage: IV M1a 1 (16.66%), IV M1b 3 (50%), IV M1d 2 (33.33%).
Akkermansia muciniphila (ATCC BAA-83) was inoculated into BD Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth (Millipore, 53286) supplemented with 0.4% mucin (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, LS002976) and Remel vitamin K/Hemin solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat: R450951) and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 24 h. Lactobacillus reuteri , kindly provided by Dr Giorgio Trinchieri (CCR-NCI-NIH), was inoculated into a BD Difco Lactobacilli MRS broth (BD, Cat: 288130) supplemented with Remel vitamin K/Hemin solution (Thermo Fisher scientific, cat: R450951) and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 24 h. Cell density was estimated using OD600 of 1 = 8 × 10 8 cells/ml before freezing in PBS +25% glycerol at 10 9 cells/0.2mL to use directly in experiments. All handling of bacteria was performed in a Whitley A35 Anaerobic Workstation and all reagents were vented in an anaerobic atmosphere for at least 24 hours prior to use to limit contact of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen.
C57BL/6-derived EL4 lymphoma and MC38 colon carcinoma (female) were grown in 10% FBS RPMI medium supplemented with 1mM pyruvate, 2mM L-glutamine and 0.1mM non-essential amino acids at 37 °C 5% CO 2 in air atmosphere. C57BL/6-syngeneic BP (BRAF V600E /PTEN −/− ) melanoma cells were grown in 10% FBS DMEM medium supplemented with L-glutamine 37 °C 5% CO 2 in air atmosphere. TUBO breast carcinoma cells (female) established from a BALB/c-neuT spontaneous lobular carcinoma, kindly provided by Drs. Elda Tagliabue and Mario Colombo (Fondazione IRCCS “Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori,” Milan, Italy), were grown in 10% FBS RPMI medium supplemented with L-glutamine 37 °C 5% CO 2 in air atmosphere. All cell lines used for in vivo tumor models were tested for specific mouse pathogens (MTBM test) but were not authenticated. THP1-Dual KI-mSTING Cells (cat thpd-mstg, InvivoGen) were cultured following manufacturer instructions and used for in vitro assays only.
B6 mice were shaved and injected in the right flank subcutaneously with 5x10 5 EL4 lymphoma, 2x10 5 MC38 colon carcinoma, or 8x10 5 BP melanoma cells. BALB/c mice were injected into the right mammary fat pad with 5x10 5 TUBO breast carcinoma cells. For tumor growth kinetic and therapy studies, tumor sizes were measured three times/week and animals were euthanized at endpoint. Tumor volume (mm 3 ) was calculated using the following formula: 𝑉 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 = ( 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ) ∗ ( 𝑠 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ) 2 2
For anti-PD-1 efficacy studies, MC38 tumors were treated with anti-PD-1 (BioXCell, BE0146) or isotype control (BioXcell, BE0089) when tumors reach approximately 50mm 3 . Antibodies were administered intraperitoneally (IP) at a dose of 200μg per mouse every three days for a total of 3 doses. For anti-PD-L1 efficacy studies, MC38 tumors were treated with anti-PD-L1 (kindly provided by Genentech, 6E11.mlgG1.WT) or isotype control (BioXcell, BE0154) when tumors reach approximately 100mm 3 . Antibodies were administered intraperitoneally (IP) at a dose of 200μg per mouse every three days for a total of 3 doses. For response to chemotherapy, EL4 tumor bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally once with 10mg/kg oxaliplatin when tumors reach 100-200mm 3 size, around a week after tumor implantation.
For IFNAR-1 blockade experiments, EL4 tumor bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5mg of IgG1 isotype control (BioXCell, MOPC-21) or anti-IFNAR-1 antibody (BioXCell, MAR1-5A3) every three days starting at day four post tumor implantation for a total of four injections. For in vivo administration of c-di-AMP (InvivoGen), mice were injected IP with 25μg diluted in PBS 72 hours and 3 hours prior to euthanasia and tissue harvesting.
For modified diets, 30% pectin fiber diet (Envigo, TD.170555) and 45%kcal fat Western diet (Envigo, TD.08811) were given starting 2-3 weeks prior to tumor implantation and continuing throughout the study. For fiber diet, we used mice obtained from the same vendor and with the same genetic background but bred in two different facilities (MD or NY), which allowed us to study the effect of dietary intervention on animals with different initial microbiota compositions. For depletion of microbiota in SPF mice, a cocktail containing 0.5g/L Primaxin, 0.5g/L Vancomycin, and 0.7g/L Neomycin was provided in autoclaved drinking water (changed every other day) starting 3 weeks before tumor implantation and continuing throughout the study. For single antibiotic experiments, 0.5g/L Vancomycin was provided in drinking water (changed weekly) following the same regimen. When indicated, fecal matter transplants were performed using cecum from mice fed 30% fiber diet or standard chow as control, to mice raised under GF conditions. For this, cecum contents of donor mice were collected in anaerobic conditions, filter through a 100μm cell strainer and stored at −80°C in 25% glycerol PBS until use. Mice received 200μl of fecal slurry via oral gavage three times in one week and rested one week before tumor implantation.
Tumors were harvested from mice 7-9 days post-implantation or when they reached the 200-400 mm 3 depending on the model. To obtain single cell suspensions, tumors were mechanically disrupted prior to enzymatic digestion with 0.5% FCS RPMI containing 1mg/ml DNase (Roche, 10104159001) and 200U collagenase IV (GIBCO, 17104-019) for 1 hour at 37°C. The digested tissue was then passed through a 40μm filter followed by 5min of red blood cell lysis with ACK. Spleens and lymph nodes were injected with 1mL and 0.5mL, respectively, of the same digestion media and incubated for 25 min at 37°C before passing through a 40μm filter and performing of red blood cell lysis with ACK. Single cell suspensions were resuspended in PBS and stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen) followed by the staining with the corresponding antibody cocktail prepared in Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences, 563794). Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibody (2.4G2, BioXcell) and the following anti-mouse antibodies were used: CD4 (GK1.5), CD11b (M1/70), CD24 (M1/69), CD45 (30-F11), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD49b (DX5), CD64 (X54-5/7.1), CD135 (A2F10.1), CD274/PDL1 (MIH5), Ly6C (AL-21), Ly6G (1A8), MHCII (M5/114.15.2), NK1.1 (PK-136), SiglecF (E50-2440), SiglecH (440C), TCR-β (H57-597), Ter119 (TER-119), all purchased from BD Biosciences; CCR7 (4B12), CD8a (53-6.7), CD11b (M1/70), CD19 (6D5), CD86 (GL1), CD103 (2E7), CD206 (C068C2), F4/80 (BM8), Ly6C (HK1.4), Ly6G (1A8), NKp46 (29A1.4), NK1.1 (PK136), SiglecH (551), XCR1 (ZET), CD68 (FA-11), all purchased from BioLegend; CCR7 (4B12), CD8a (53-6.7), CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), CD19 (eBio1D3), CD49b (DX5), CD103 (2E7), CD209a (MMD3), CD135 (A2F10), MHC-II (M5/114.15.2), NK1.1 (PK136), TCRγδ (eBioGL3), TCRβ (H57-597), Ter119 (TER-119), CD3 (145-2C11), all purchased from Thermo Fisher. When biotinylated antibodies were used, cells were subsequently incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin. For intracellular markers, cells were fixed and permeabilized using FOXP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions after surface staining and incubated with the corresponding antibodies.
Samples were acquired in a FACS Symphony A5 running under BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed with FlowJo software (v.10.6.0). Further analysis was performed with the R package Cytofkit2 2.0.1 ( Chen et al., 2016 21. Chen, H. ∙ Lau, M.C. ∙ Wong, M.T. ... Cytofkit: A Bioconductor Package for an Integrated Mass Cytometry Data Analysis Pipeline PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12 :e1005112 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ) as described ( Araya and Goldszmid, 2020 3. Araya, R.E. ∙ Goldszmid, R.S. Characterization of the tumor immune infiltrate by multiparametric flow cytometry and unbiased high-dimensional data analysis Methods Enzymol. 2020; 632 :309-337 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). The preliminary gating strategy for all analysis is: (1) FSC-A versus SSC-A for debris exclusion; (2) FSC-H versus FSC-A for doublet exclusion; (3) SSC-A versus Live/Dead for dead cell exclusion; (4) SSC-A versus CD45 for positive cells (tumor infiltrating leukocytes). t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm was run with a concatenation of all samples per group simultaneously. For cluster analysis, Rphenograph was selected in the same package ( k = 30) and the clusters were annotated based on expression levels of the markers of interest. Clusters representing the populations of interest were selected and quantified using FlowJo. Cell populations were defined as indicated in Table S6. Frequencies from total leukocytes (Live CD45 + cells) were determined and absolute numbers per mg of tumor were calculated.
Detection of mRNA was done by PrimeFlow RNA Assay (ThermoFisher) using probes type 1 for Xcl1 AF647 (ThermoFisher, VB1-19578-PF), type 6 for Ccl5 AF750 (ThermoFisher, VB6-14424-PF) or type 10 for Ifnb1 AF568 (ThermoFisher, VB10-3282108-PF) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For ex vivo stimulation with c-di-AMP, single cell suspensions of total tumor infiltrating cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , for 3 hours with or without 100μg/ml c-di-AMP (InvivoGen) in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 50μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1mM non-essential amino acids, and 2mM L-glutamine.
Single cell suspensions of EL4 tumors from SPF and GF mice were sorted as LiveCD45 + CD3 neg CD19 neg NK1.1 neg Ly6G neg with additional markers for each population of interest: dendritic cells (DCs; CD11c hi MHCII hi ), monocytes (Mo; Ly6C hi F4/80 low-neg ), monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-derived Mac; Ly6C int-low F4/80 pos ). Sorted populations were resuspended in RLT buffer and analyzed using nCounter analysis system (NanoString Technologies) with a custom panel of 530 genes related to myeloid cells and inflammation according to manufacturer’s instructions ( Goldszmid et al., 2012 36. Goldszmid, R.S. ∙ Caspar, P. ∙ Rivollier, A. ... NK cell-derived interferon-γ orchestrates cellular dynamics and the differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells at the site of infection Immunity. 2012; 36 :1047-1059 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). For analysis of expression, each sample was normalized to technical controls and housekeeping genes: Asb7 , Eif4h , Gsk3a , Nol6 , Oaz1 , Pex1 , Poldip3 , Rnf214 , Sap130 , Sdha . The data was then log2 transformed and batch-effect removal was performed between two independent experiments using Partek Genomics Suite. To verify cell identity, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA_4.0.3) was used to associate gene expression patterns with ImmGen gene sets. One-way ANOVA was used to compare groups and p values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (FDR). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in R using the singular value decomposition approach and visualized with the package scatterplot3d_0.3-41. Heatmaps were created in R using ComplexHeatmaps 1.20.0 ( Gu et al., 2016 40. Gu, Z. ∙ Eils, R. ∙ Schlesner, M. Complex heatmaps reveal patterns and correlations in multidimensional genomic data Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :2847-2849 Crossref Scopus (1658) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hierarchical clustering was used to extract gene clusters which were subsequently assessed in Mac and DCs ImmGen populations (GSE122108) using mean expression of all genes in that cluster within the population of interest.
Single cell suspension of EL4 tumors from SPF or GF mice were obtained as described above. Cell hashing with barcoded CD45 antibodies were used to pool biological replicates. Samples were then sorted as either LiveCD45 + CD3 neg for tumor infiltrating leukocytes or LiveCD45 + CD3 neg CD19 neg NK1.1 neg TCRb neg TCRgd neg Ter119 neg for TME myeloid cell compartment followed by library preparation and scRNA sequencing using the 10X Genomics protocol by the NCI CCR Single Cell Analysis Facility.
All analyses were carried out on NIH biowulf2 high performance computing environment. We used the following R packages for the analyses: Seurat_3.1.4, monocle_2.14.0, DESeq2_1.30.1, fgsea_1.16.0, and msigdbr_7.2.1. The Seurat package ( Butler et al., 2018 15. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (2766) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for clustering and UMAP analysis. The low-quality cells were removed using the following criteria: 1) percent of mitochondrial genes above 15%; 2) doublet cells or negative cells with multiple hashing antibodies or no hashing antibody, respectively. For integrating SPF and GF data, we used the functions of FindIntegrationAnchors (anchor.features = 5000) and IntegrateData. Clustering analysis was performed with FindClusters (resolution = 0.5; Tables S2 and S4 ). Differential gene expression between SPF and GF was performed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 58. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (22550) PubMed Google Scholar ). We aggregated cells based on hashing antibodies, which were used as biological replicates for DESeq2 analysis. Trajectory analysis was performed with Monocle 2 ( Qiu et al., 2017 75. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (796) PubMed Google Scholar ). For analysis of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), cluster gene expression from LiveCD45 + CD3 neg CD19 neg NK1.1 neg TCRb neg TCRgd neg Ter119 neg samples were mapped to previously published mouse immune cell type signatures ( Zilionis et al., 2019 104. Zilionis, R. ∙ Engblom, C. ∙ Pfirschke, C. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Human and Mouse Lung Cancers Reveals Conserved Myeloid Populations across Individuals and Species Immunity. 2019; 50 :1317-1334.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clusters mapping to monocytes (Mo), macrophages (Mac), or dendritic cells (DCs, excluding plasmacytoid dendritic cells) were extracted for downstream analysis. Mean expression of cluster specific genes (FDR < 0.1, |log2(fold change)| > 0.5) were mapped to ImmGen populations (GSE122108) to identify cell types further. Dot plots created using node color as average expression across cells within cluster (hierarchical clustering parameter) and node size as percentage of cells within clusters expressing the specific gene. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for further analysis. Common DEGs were visualized using Circos. The statistics from the DESeq2 analysis as rank list was used to perform GSEA analysis (FDR < 0.01) with FGSEA ( Korotkevich et al., 2021 50. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sergushichev, A. ∙ Sukhov, V. ... Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Google Scholar ) using the Hallmark gene sets from MSigDB ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp ). GSEA plots were generated with plotEnrichment function. To assess the possible gene regulation by different Interferons (IFNs), DEGs between SPF and GF MPs were contrasted with the Interferome data base ( Rusinova et al., 2013 79. Rusinova, I. ∙ Forster, S. ∙ Yu, S. ... Interferome v2.0: an updated database of annotated interferon-regulated genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D1040-D1046 Crossref Scopus (467) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of genes regulated by type I, type II and type I/II IFNs were obtained and plotted for each population.
Tumor pieces were mechanically disrupted in Buffer RLT Plus (QIAGEN) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol followed by homogenization with QIAshredder (QIAGEN) and total RNA extraction with the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RNA concentration and purity were assessed using DS-11 Series Spectrophotometer (DeNovix). Reverse transcription was performed using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad). Subsequent cDNA was used for qPCR with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in duplicate wells on QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycle conditions: activation 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60°C for 60 s; melting curve for assessment of amplicons. Primer pairs (Table S7) were used at a final concentration of 500 nM.
EL4 tumors were homogenized using 500μl Cell Lysis Buffer (Invitrogen, EPX-99999-000) for every 100mg of tissue with a rotor-stator homogenizer. Supernatant was extracted and total protein concentration was measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23227). Samples were diluted to 10mg protein/mL with PBS and analyzed with the Cytokine & Chemokine Convenience 36-Plex Mouse ProcartaPlex Panel 1A (Invitrogen, EPXR360-26092-901) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Analyte concentrations were normalized to mean value of control group (fold change) within each independent experiment before combining for downstream analysis.
Fresh fecal pellets collected from individual mice were stored at −80°C until analysis. One pellet per sample was loaded individually into wells of a 96-well plate for DNA extraction followed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing at the National Cancer Institute Microbiome and Genetics Core Facility using their standard workflow previously described ( Bae et al., 2020 5. Bae, H.R. ∙ Leung, P.S.C. ∙ Hodge, D.L. ...

Attenuation of immune-mediated bone marrow damage in conventionally housed mice Mol. Carcinog. 2020; 59 :237-245 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, extracted DNA underwent a two-step PCR protocol to amplify and barcode the 16S V4 region (515F-806R). Samples were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Paired-end fastq reads were subsequently analyzed using DADA2 ( Callahan et al., 2016 16. Callahan, B.J. ∙ McMurdie, P.J. ∙ Rosen, M.J. ... DADA2: High-resolution sample inference from Illumina amplicon data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :581-583 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and QIIME 2 2019.4 ( Bolyen et al., 2019 10. Bolyen, E. ∙ Rideout, J.R. ∙ Dillon, M.R. ... Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2 Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :852-857 Crossref Scopus (2959) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Three independent experiments were used consisting of B6-Ly5.1/Cr mice from CRL obtained from one of two different facilities (MD or NY). The bacterial abundance table for each of the three independent experiments were relativized and quantile normalized. Mann-Whitney tests were calculated per experiments for the 333 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that were common in the three experiments. ASVs were considered to be differentially abundant microbes (DAMs) if they had the same direction of (Control versus Fiber) fold-change in all three experiments, with Fisher-pvalue and FDR of < 10%. Visualization of ASVs and DAMs was performed using iTOL ( Letunic and Bork, 2019 54. Letunic, I. ∙ Bork, P. Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v4: recent updates and new developments Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W256-W259 Crossref Scopus (2133) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used transkingdom network analysis ( Lam et al., 2018 52. Lam, K.C. ∙ Vyshenska, D. ∙ Hu, J. ...

Food Res. 2020; 64 :e1900789 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) to associate fecal DAMs prior to tumor implantation as a predictor for tumor phenotypes 1 week post implantation. Two independent experiments were used for which bacterial abundances and mouse tumor phenotype data (e.g., tumor weight, dendritic cells/mg tumor) were available. First, Spearman’s rank correlations were calculated between all pairs of microbes and phenotypes by pooling the fiber samples from both experiments. Correlations were retained if they had p values < 15% and satisfied principles of causality (i.e., satisfied fold change relationship between the two partners in fiber versus control) ( Yambartsev et al., 2016 100. Yambartsev, A. ∙ Perlin, M.A. ∙ Kovchegov, Y. ... Unexpected links reflect the noise in networks Biol. Direct. 2016; 11 :52 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thereafter, correlations were calculated per experiment in fiber samples. Finally, edges obtained from pooling were retained if they had the same sign of correlation coefficient as those calculated per experiment and false positive edges due to pooling experiments were removed to make the transkingdom network. Bipartite betweenness centrality analysis ( Dong et al., 2015 28. Dong, X. ∙ Yambartsev, A. ∙ Ramsey, S.A. ... Reverse enGENEering of Regulatory Networks from Big Data: A Roadmap for Biologists Bioinform. Biol. Insights. 2015; 9 :61-74 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to identify “bottleneck” microbes connecting the microbial network to phenotypes. Microbes with high betweenness centrality and strongly connected to host phenotypes are more likely key regulators of host outcomes (e.g., changes in tumor weight).
For GF monocolonization experiments, mice received an oral gavage of 0.2mL (10 9 cells) of A. muciniphila or L. reuteri twice in one week followed by one week of break before tumor implantation. Prior to each dose, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.3mg Famotidine (Fresenius Kabi USA, NDC 63323-738-09) and 0.02mg Sincalide (GoldBio, W-190-2).
For all liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) methods, LCMS grade solvents were used. Tributylamine was purchased from Millipore Sigma. LCMS grade water, methanol, isopropanol, and acetic acid were purchased through Fisher Scientific. All standards were purchased from InvivoGen. Spectral information for each CDN standard was acquired via direct injection in negative mode and collision energy was ramped. The top four most abundant signals for each CDN species were selected and instrument conditions were optimized to maximize signal. Signals were validated to avoid background noise by spiking standard into sample and the top two multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) pairs were selected for each analyte. Declustering potential (DP), Entrance Potential (EP), Collision Energy (CE), Collision Cell Exit Potential (CXP) were set as follows: Molecule MRM pair DP EP CE CXP c-di-AMP 657.0/328.0 ∗ −70 −10 −40 −15 c-di-AMP 657.0/134.0 −70 −10 −50 −15 c-di-GMP 689.0/344.1 ∗ −70 −10 −50 −15 c-di-GMP 689.0/150.0 −70 −10 −50 −15 c-GAMP 673/79 ∗ −70 −10 −120 −15 c-GAMP 673/134 −70 −10 −70 −15 Open table in a new tab
All source and collision parameters are in units of volts and ∗ denotes those used for quantification. Samples were extracted by addition of 1:1 methanol and water on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 16k xg for 20 minutes at 4°C to remove macromolecules. Volume was reduced as necessary using an SPD130 Savant SpeedVac. All molecular analysis was performed using a series of targeted MRM methods. All samples were separated using a Sciex ExionLC AC system and analyzed using a Sciex 5500 QTRAP® mass spectrometer. All samples were separated across a Waters Atlantis T3 column (100Å, 3 μm, 3 mm X 100 mm) with a binary gradient from 5 mM tributylamine, 5 mM acetic acid in 2% isopropanol, 5% methanol, 93% water (v/v) to 100% isopropanol over seven minutes. Concentration was calculated using an 8 point standard curve. Putative unique fragment peaks were selected from 2′3′ and 3′3’ -c-GAMP however these signals were unable to distinguish between these isomers and a single set of MRMs was developed for c-GAMP species. However, c-GAMP was not detected in cecum from GF mice while it was present in that from SPF animals, indicating that the c-GAMP measured corresponds to the bacterial related 3′3’-c-GAMP and not the mammalian host associated 2′3′-c-GAMP.
STING pathway functional assessment was performed using THP1-Dual KI-mSTING Cells (thpd-mstg, InvivoGen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 90,000 cells were incubated in a 96-well plate with or without the STING-inhibitor H-151 (inh-h151, InvivoGen) at 400 ng/ml for 2 hours at 37°C 5% CO 2 . Heat-killed A. muciniphila was prepared in PBS heating at 95°C for 30min. Heat-killed A. muciniphila at MOI 100 or 20μl of spent supernatant was added and incubated for 20-24 hours. When indicated, 3μg/ml of c-di-AMP was added to the culture as a positive control. IRF3 activation was quantified using QUANTI-Luc (rep-qlc1, InvivoGen) bioluminescent assay in a plate reader using a 100ms integration time. Measurements were normalized to their respective vehicle controls before analysis.
FPKM normalized tumor RNAseq data was obtained from 10 R and 12 NR patients treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) alone or in combination with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) ( Helmink et al., 2020 45. Helmink, B.A. ∙ Reddy, S.M. ∙ Gao, J. ... B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures promote immunotherapy response Nature. 2020; 577 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples from multiple time points (baseline, on-treatment, surgery) were used collectively for downstream analysis. FPKM normalized tumor RNAseq data was additionally obtained from an independent validation cohort of advanced melanoma patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) ( Liu et al., 2019 57. Liu, D. ∙ Schilling, B. ∙ Liu, D. ... Integrative molecular and clinical modeling of clinical outcomes to PD1 blockade in patients with metastatic melanoma Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1916-1927 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only samples obtained from skin biopsies were retained to eliminate any potential inter-tissue variation (n = 84). R patients were defined using best radiographic response (RECIST 1.1) criteria as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) without progression for at least 180 days. NR patients were defined using RECIST 1.1 criteria as progressive disease (PD) or stable disease with progression within 180 days. Mixed response patients (n = 1) were excluded from R/NR comparisons.
TMM normalized tumor and gut RNAseq data was obtained from 3 R and 6 NR refractory metastatic melanoma patients treated with fecal matter transplant (FMT) along with a reinduction of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) ( Baruch et al., 2021 7. Baruch, E.N. ∙ Youngster, I. ∙ Ben-Betzalel, G. ... Fecal microbiota transplant promotes response in immunotherapy-refractory melanoma patients Science. 2021; 371 :602-609 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential gene expression between R and NR tumor samples at each time point (pre- or post-FMT) was performed using DESeq2. The statistics from the DESeq2 analysis as rank list was used to perform GSEA analysis (FDR < 0.01) using the Hallmark gene sets from MSigDB ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp ). GSEA plots were generated with plotEnrichment function.
Each cohort was analyzed separately but followed the same procedure for the quantification of immune signatures. Briefly, expression values were log2-transformed, and z-scores were calculated across all samples based on the mean expression value of signature genes. Genes missing from datasets were excluded. The following gene signatures were used as previously described ( Böttcher et al., 2018 11. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Bonavita, E. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... NK Cells Stimulate Recruitment of cDC1 into the Tumor Microenvironment Promoting Cancer Immune Control Cell. 2018; 172 :1022-1037.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ): chemokines ( XCL1 , XCL2 , CCL5 ), NK cells ( NCR1 , NCR3 , KLRB1 , CD160 , PRF1 ), cDC1 ( CLEC9A , XCR1 , CLNK , BATF3 ), and CD8 T cells ( CD8A , CD8B , CD3E ). We additionally used the following signatures: classical monocytes ( LYZ , ITGAL , VCAN , CSF1R , CD14 , FCGR3A , CCR2 , S100A9 ), dendritic cells ( CD1C , CD1A , LY75 , LTB , CD86 , FLT3 , CD80 , CD40 , SIRPA ), and type I IFN ( CXCL10 , IFI16 , IFI27 , IFI30 , IFI6 , IFIH1 , IFIT1 , IFIT2 , IFIT3 , IFITM1 , IFITM2 , IFITM3 , IFNA1 , IFNA2 , IFNA4 , IFNAR1 , IFNAR2 , IFNB1 , IFNE , IFNW1 , IRF1 , IRF2 , IRF3 , IRF5 , IRF7 , IRF9 , ISG15 , ISG20 , JAK1 , JAK2 , OAS1 , OAS2 , SOCS1 , STAT1 , STAT2 , STAT3 , TMEM173 , TYK2 ). For assessment of macrophage infiltration, CIBERSORT ( Newman et al., 2015 69. Newman, A.M. ∙ Liu, C.L. ∙ Green, M.R. ... Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :453-457 Crossref Scopus (2909) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to estimate cell fractions across samples.
Fecal sample collection and FMT from R and NR metastatic melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade therapy at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center were performed as previously described ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018 37. Gopalakrishnan, V. ∙ Spencer, C.N. ∙ Nezi, L. ... Gut microbiome modulates response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients Science. 2018; 359 :97-103 Crossref Scopus (1626) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fecal samples from three responder (R) or three non-responder (NR) human donors were individually transferred into independent cohorts of 5-8 GF mice per donor. 200 μL cleared supernatant from 0.1 g/μl human fecal suspension was obtained using a 100 μm strainer and gavaged into mice for 3 doses over 1 week, followed by a 1-week break to allow for the establishment of the microbiota. Mice were then injected in the right flank subcutaneously with 8x10 5 BRAF V600E /PTEN −/− (BP) cells. Tumor growth and survival were assessed, and tumors were harvested and processed as described above for analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software or R. Data were analyzed for normal distribution prior to comparisons. Outliers were detected using Grubbs’ test and excluded from the analysis. Values are presented as the mean ± SEM; individual values are presented as scatterplots with column bar graphs or truncated violin plots. Data in pie charts represent mean of samples in group. Statistical significance between two groups was determined using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney (non-parametric). For the comparison of multiple groups, statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test (parametric) or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s test (non-parametric). For tumor outcome experiments, the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used for long-term survival analyses and mixed-effects analysis or two-way ANOVA were used for tumor growth measurements. For long-term survival analyses, mice were censored when they exit the study for reasons not related with the study endpoint. For the comparison of protein expression profiles, positive or negative mean differences were categorized and assessed using the Kappa statistic ( Landis and Koch, 1977 53. Landis, J.R. ∙ Koch, G.G. The measurement of observer agreement for categorical data Biometrics. 1977; 33 :159-174 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (FDR) was used to adjust p values for multiple testing. All measurements shown are distinct biological replicates unless otherwise noted. For animal studies, sample size was defined based on past experience with the models. The minimum number of animals necessary to achieve the scientific objectives was used for ethical reasons. Animals were allocated randomly to each treatment group and different groups were processed identically.
