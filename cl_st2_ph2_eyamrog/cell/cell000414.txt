Title: Sneezing reflex is mediated by a peptidergic pathway from nose to brainstem


Abstract: Summary

Sneezing is a vital respiratory reflex frequently associated with allergic rhinitis and viral respiratory infections. However, its neural circuit remains largely unknown. A sneeze-evoking region was discovered in both cat and human brainstems, corresponding anatomically to the central recipient zone of nasal sensory neurons. Therefore, we hypothesized that a neuronal population postsynaptic to nasal sensory neurons mediates sneezing in this region. By screening major presynaptic neurotransmitters/neuropeptides released by nasal sensory neurons, we found that neuromedin B (NMB) peptide is essential for signaling sneezing. Ablation of NMB-sensitive postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region or deficiency in NMB receptor abolished the sneezing reflex. Remarkably, NMB-sensitive neurons further project to the caudal ventral respiratory group (cVRG). Chemical activation of NMB-sensitive neurons elicits action potentials in cVRG neurons and leads to sneezing behavior. Our study delineates a peptidergic pathway mediating sneezing, providing molecular insights into the sneezing reflex arc.

Section: Introduction

Sneezing is a basic reflex that expels irritants and pathogens from the airway. Although designed to be a defense mechanism, sneezing is associated with many viral respiratory infections (e.g., common cold and flu) and allergic rhinitis (a.k.a., hay fever) and severely impacts our quality of life and productivity ( Songu and Cingi, 2009 46. Songu, M. ∙ Cingi, C. Sneeze reflex: facts and fiction Ther. Adv. Respir. Dis. 2009; 3 :131-141 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, sneezing represents the most forceful and common mechanism to spread infectious droplets during viral respiratory infections. Studies indicate that a single sneeze can create 40,000 virus-containing droplets that reach a radius of 7 to 8 m and suspend in the air for up to 10 min ( Bourouiba, 2016 3. Bourouiba, L.

In contrast, a cough produces 3,000 droplets at most, which is about the same number as talking continuously for 5 min ( Cole and Cook, 1998 10. Cole, E.C. ∙ Cook, C.E.

From the perspective of either basic science or clinical medicine, it is of paramount importance to understand the mechanisms underlying sneezing.
A sneeze-evoking region was discovered in the ventromedial spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) of both cats and humans ( Hersch, 2000 20. Hersch, M. Loss of ability to sneeze in lateral medullary syndrome Neurology. 2000; 54 :520-521 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Nonaka et al., 1990 38. Nonaka, S. ∙ Unno, T. ∙ Ohta, Y. ...

Psychiatry. 2006; 77 :559-561 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Electrical stimulations of this region evoke sneeze-like responses in cats ( Nonaka et al., 1990 38. Nonaka, S. ∙ Unno, T. ∙ Ohta, Y. ... Sneeze-evoking region within the brainstem Brain Res. 1990; 511 :265-270 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stroke-induced lesions on this region lead to paroxysmal sneezing or loss of ability to sneeze in humans ( Hersch, 2000 20. Hersch, M. Loss of ability to sneeze in lateral medullary syndrome Neurology. 2000; 54 :520-521 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Seijo-Martínez et al., 2006 43. Seijo-Martínez, M. ∙ Varela-Freijanes, A. ∙ Grandes, J. ... Sneeze related area in the medulla: localisation of the human sneezing centre? J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2006; 77 :559-561 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the lack of information on the molecular identities of the neurons mediating sneezing in this region and related synaptic pathway impedes further investigation.
The sneeze-evoking region corresponds anatomically to the central recipient zone of the ethmoidal nerve that provides sensory branches to the nasal mucosa ( Hersch, 2000 20. Hersch, M. Loss of ability to sneeze in lateral medullary syndrome Neurology. 2000; 54 :520-521 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Lucier and Egizii, 1986 32. Lucier, G.E. ∙ Egizii, R.

Psychiatry. 2006; 77 :559-561 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the region comprises the postsynaptic neurons of nasal sensory neurons. We therefore hypothesize that a specific population of postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region mediates the sneezing reflex. Previous studies have shown that stimulation of nasal sensory fibers or ethmoidal nerve triggers sneezing in both cats and humans ( Batsel and Lines, 1978 1. Batsel, H.L. ∙ Lines, A.J.

Role of respiratory and non-respiratory neurones in the region of the NTS in the elaboration of the sneeze reflex in cat Brain Res. 1997; 768 :71-85 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it remains unclear which population of nasal sensory neurons initiates the sneezing reflex and which neurotransmitters/neuropeptides in nasal sensory neurons are required for transmitting sneeze signals. Lacking this information greatly impedes the study of the postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region and hinders testing our hypothesis.
Sneezing is a reflex generated by central respiratory neurons. Nevertheless, the sneeze-evoking region is located within the ventromedial SpV and does not overlap with any reported respiratory centers in the brainstem ( Feldman et al., 2013 15. Feldman, J.L. ∙ Del Negro, C.A. ∙ Gray, P.A. Understanding the rhythm of breathing: so near, yet so far Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2013; 75 :423-452 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the sneeze-evoking region further projects to central respiratory groups. Studies have characterized sneeze-related electrical activities in different groups of central respiratory neurons in cats ( Batsel and Lines, 1978 1. Batsel, H.L. ∙ Lines, A.J. Discharge of respiratory neurons in sneezes resulting from ethmoidal nerve stimulation Exp. Neurol. 1978; 58 :410-424 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jakus et al., 1985 23.

Wallois, F. ∙ Bodineau, L. ∙ Macron, J.M. ... Role of respiratory and non-respiratory neurones in the region of the NTS in the elaboration of the sneeze reflex in cat Brain Res. 1997; 768 :71-85 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). As sneezes interrupt the normal pattern of respiration, whether these electrical activities are the “drivers” or “passengers” of sneezing and whether they are induced by inputs from the sneeze-evoking region remain unknown.
In this study, we reveal the molecular identities of the neurons mediating sneezing in the sneeze-evoking region and delineate their anatomical and functional connections with central respiratory neurons. We developed a two-step reverse screening strategy to identify the neuronal population essential for sneezing in the sneeze-evoking region. First, we screened all major presynaptic neurotransmitters/neuropeptides released by nasal sensory neurons for sneeze signaling and identified the neuropeptide that is critically required for transmitting sneeze signals. Second, we targeted the corresponding postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region, and studied their role in mediating sneezing. This strategy successfully helped us identify a highly restricted neuronal population that is key for the sneezing reflex in the sneeze-evoking region. To further determine which populations of respiratory neurons are the projection target(s) of the sneeze-evoking region, we conducted neuronal tracing, electrophysiology recording, and behavioral studies. These studies reveal that the caudal ventral respiratory group (cVRG) is a direct projection target of the sneeze-evoking region and drives the generation of sneezes. Collectively, we delineate the peptidergic pathway from nasal sensory neurons to central respiratory neurons that mediates the sneezing reflex. This newly defined pathway greatly advances our understanding of the neural mechanism underlying the sneezing reflex and has important implications in the development of therapeutic strategies for pathological sneezing.

Section: Results

Sneezing is characterized by convulsive expulsion of air and the sound “achoo” in humans. However, most previous studies used anesthetized or decerebrate cats that could not make real sneezes and monitored fictive sneezing represented by diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle activities and related nerve activity ( Batsel and Lines, 1978 1.

Role of respiratory and non-respiratory neurones in the region of the NTS in the elaboration of the sneeze reflex in cat Brain Res. 1997; 768 :71-85 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). To study the neural mechanism underlying the sneezing reflex, we established a behavioral model in freely moving mice. Studies have shown that capsaicin (a pungent compound from chili pepper) and histamine elicit sneezes in humans ( Doyle et al., 1990 13. Doyle, W.J. ∙ Boehm, S. ∙ Skoner, D.P. Physiologic responses to intranasal dose-response challenges with histamine, methacholine, bradykinin, and prostaglandin in adult volunteers with and without nasal allergy J. Allergy Clin.

Pharmacol. 1988; 93 :509-514 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tønnesen and Mygind, 1985 49. Tønnesen, P. ∙ Mygind, N. Nasal challenge with serotonin and histamine in normal persons Allergy. 1985; 40 :350-353 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). By delivering aerosolized droplets containing capsaicin or histamine via a nebulizer to the mouse test chambers, we found that both compounds triggered sneeze-like responses in mice ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Specifically, the audio recording revealed sneeze-like episodes characterized by audio peaks, which comprise both sonic and ultrasonic components and are distinct from nociception-associated vocalization ( Figures 1 A and S1 ; Video S1 ). Whole-body plethysmography (WBP) showed repetitive sneeze-like respiratory patterns characterized by forceful and convulsive expiration ( Figure 1 A). The respiratory patterns and audio peaks correlate well, as revealed by simultaneous WBP and audio recordings ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ; Video S2 ). To confirm that the audio and respiratory responses are sneezes and not other respiratory reflexes, we examined whether these responses are mediated by sensory fibers innervating the nasal mucosa rather than those in the trachea, lung, or other sites. The anterior ethmoidal nerve (AEN) provides sensory branches to the nasal mucosa and plays an essential role in triggering sneezes ( Batsel and Lines, 1978 1. Batsel, H.L. ∙ Lines, A.J.

Role of respiratory and non-respiratory neurones in the region of the NTS in the elaboration of the sneeze reflex in cat Brain Res. 1997; 768 :71-85 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). After transecting AEN, we found that the audio- and respiratory responses to both capsaicin and histamine were significantly reduced compared with the sham surgery group ( Figure 1 B), confirming that these responses are sneezes mediated by nasal sensory fibers.

Video recording showing the simultaneous WBP and audio recordings of mouse sneezing responses to capsaicin, related to Figure 1
Convulsive expulsion of air and associated sound are generated by sudden and involuntary muscular movements during sneezing. By conducting electromyography (EMG) recording of the diaphragm and external oblique abdominus of lightly anesthetized mice, we observed sudden and involuntary muscular movements upon nasal challenge of capsaicin ( Figure 1 C), consistent with sneezing-related muscular movement in cats ( Nonaka et al., 1990 38. Nonaka, S. ∙ Unno, T. ∙ Ohta, Y. ... Sneeze-evoking region within the brainstem Brain Res. 1990; 511 :265-270 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Satoh et al., 1998 41. Satoh, I. ∙ Shiba, K. ∙ Kobayashi, N. ... Upper airway motor outputs during sneezing and coughing in decerebrate cats Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). To confirm that the recorded muscular movements faithfully reflect sneezing in mice, we ablated nasal sensory fibers that express Trpv1, a capsaicin-sensitive cation channel. This ablation abolished capsaicin-induced muscular movements, as revealed by EMG ( Figure 1 D). These results confirm that the recorded muscular movements are triggered by nasal sensory fibers and faithfully reflect sneezing, but not other respiratory responses (e.g., coughing mediated by sensory fibers in the lower airway), in mice. In addition to muscular movement, nasal secretion is also significantly increased after capsaicin-induced sneezing ( Figure 1 E). Together, our studies firmly establish the mouse sneezing model.
Sensory neurons are highly heterogeneous and can be grossly classified into two groups, myelinated large-diameter neurons that detect innocuous stimuli (e.g., light touch) and thinly myelinated or unmyelinated small-diameter neurons that detect noxious stimuli. To screen the presynaptic neurotransmitters/neuropeptides essential for sneeze signaling in an efficient and precise manner, we first sought to determine which group of sensory neurons mediates sneezing. As sneezes can be readily elicited by capsaicin and histamine in humans and mice (see Figure 1 ) ( Doyle et al., 1990 13. Doyle, W.J. ∙ Boehm, S. ∙ Skoner, D.P. Physiologic responses to intranasal dose-response challenges with histamine, methacholine, bradykinin, and prostaglandin in adult volunteers with and without nasal allergy J. Allergy Clin.

Nasal challenge with serotonin and histamine in normal persons Allergy. 1985; 40 :350-353 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined the nasal innervation of sensory neurons that express Trpv1, the capsaicin-sensitive cation channel that also serves as the downstream transduction channel of histamine H1r receptor ( Caterina et al., 1997 8. Caterina, M.J. ∙ Schumacher, M.A. ∙ Tominaga, M. ...

Neurosci. 2007; 27 :2331-2337 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trpv1 is expressed by many thinly myelinated or unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Utilizing Trpv1 PLAP/+ reporter line ( Cavanaugh et al., 2011 9. Cavanaugh, D.J. ∙ Chesler, A.T. ∙ Jackson, A.C. ... Trpv1 reporter mice reveal highly restricted brain distribution and functional expression in arteriolar smooth muscle cells J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :5067-5077 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that Trpv1 + sensory fibers richly innervate the nasal mucosa and comprise a major population of nasal sensory fibers ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
To study the role of Trpv1 + small-diameter neurons in triggering sneezes, we instilled a small volume (2 μL) of resiniferatoxin (RTX) solution into the mouse nasal cavity to ablate Trpv1 + nasal sensory fibers ( Figure 2 C) ( Karai et al., 2004 24. Karai, L. ∙ Brown, D.C. ∙ Mannes, A.J. ... Deletion of vanilloid receptor 1-expressing primary afferent neurons for pain control J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113 :1344-1352 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ). After RTX treatment, audio and respiratory recordings revealed a significant reduction in the sneezing responses to capsaicin and histamine ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Furthermore, allergy-associated sneezing was also significantly reduced by desensitization of Trpv1 + nasal afferent fibers ( Figure 2 F). These results reveal the central role of Trpv1 + small-diameter neurons in mediating sneezing induced by both chemical irritants and allergens.
The identification of Trpv1 + nasal small-diameter sensory neurons in eliciting sneezing allows for targeted screening of neurotransmitters/neuropeptides essential for signaling sneezing. First, we investigated which neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are expressed in Trpv1 + nasal small-diameter neurons. Among all major neurotransmitters/neuropeptides identified in primary sensory neurons, Trpv1 + nasal sensory neurons selectively express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 ( Vglut2 ), neuropeptides substance P ( Tac1 ), CGRP ( Calca ), and neuromedin B (NMB; Nmb ) as revealed by single-cell RT-PCR ( Figure 3 A). Second, we studied which neurotransmitters/neuropeptides are required for transmitting sneeze signals by examining the sneezing responses of mice deficient in each neurotransmitter or neuropeptide. Trpv1 Cre/+ ; Vglut2 F/F conditional knockout mice failed to show a significant reduction in their sneezing responses to capsaicin compared with control littermates ( Figure 3 B), indicating that Vglut2-dependent glutamate signaling is dispensable for signaling sneezing. Furthermore, deficiency in the neuropeptide substance P or CGRP did not affect the sneezing responses either ( Figures 3 C and 3D).
Interestingly, deficiency in the neuropeptide NMB significantly reduced the sneezing responses to capsaicin ( Figure 3 E), without altering other respiratory parameters examined ( Figure S2 ). NMB deficiency also resulted in an abolishment of sneezing responses to histamine ( Figure 3 E), one of principal mast cell mediators in allergic rhinitis ( Uzzaman and Story, 2012 50. Uzzaman, A. ∙ Story, R. Chapter 5: Allergic rhinitis Allergy Asthma Proc. 2012; 33 :15-18 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to histamine, mast cells release many other mediators, including serotonin and various neuropeptides ( Kushnir-Sukhov et al., 2007 26. Kushnir-Sukhov, N.M. ∙ Brown, J.M. ∙ Wu, Y. ... Human mast cells are capable of serotonin synthesis and release J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2007; 119 :498-499 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2008 27.

Immunol. 2008; 180 :2251-2255 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the role of histamine-independent pathways in mediating sneezing remains poorly defined. We found that serotonin induces significant sneezing in mice ( Figure 3 F), correlating well with studies showing that serotonin induces sneezing in humans ( Tønnesen and Mygind, 1985 49. Tønnesen, P. ∙ Mygind, N. Nasal challenge with serotonin and histamine in normal persons Allergy. 1985; 40 :350-353 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, this sneezing response was abolished in Nmb -deficient mice ( Figure 3 F). Besides serotonin, neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is released from mast cells upon degranulation as shown by our previous study ( Lee et al., 2008 27. Lee, M.G. ∙ Dong, X. ∙ Liu, Q. ... Agonists of the MAS-related gene (Mrgs) orphan receptors as novel mediators of mast cell-sensory nerve interactions J. Immunol. 2008; 180 :2251-2255 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although NPFF has never been implicated in allergic sneezing, we found that NPFF induces significant sneezing responses in wild-type (WT) mice, but not Nmb −/− mice ( Figure 3 G). These results reveal the essential role of NMB peptide in signaling both histamine-dependent and independent sneezing responses and suggest its involvement in allergic sneezing. Further study indeed showed that NMB deficiency resulted in an abolishment of sneezing responses to mast-cell-dependent allergy ( Figures 3 H and 3I). Together, these results demonstrate that NMB is critically required for signaling sneezing.
As nasal challenge of capsaicin evokes sneezes and burning pain in humans ( Geppetti et al., 1988 16. Geppetti, P. ∙ Fusco, B.M. ∙ Marabini, S. ... Secretion, pain and sneezing induced by the application of capsaicin to the nasal mucosa in man Br. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 93 :509-514 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next investigated whether there is any dose-dependent effect of capsaicin in inducing sneezes and pain and whether NMB is required for signaling pain. Interestingly, we found an inverse dose-response relationship between capsaicin doses and sneezing responses in WT mice. High-dose capsaicin induced fewer sneezes than low-dose capsaicin ( Figure 3 J). In contrast, pain-related behavior is evoked by capsaicin in a positive dose-dependent manner. While high-dose capsaicin induced fewer sneezes, it evoked more nose wiping (stereotypic behavior indicative of pain; Figure 3 K) and more apnea episodes to reduce capsaicin inhalation (avoidance behavior; Figure 3 L), revealing an antagonism between pain and sneezing. Interestingly, NMB deficiency abolished sneezing responses to capsaicin at both low and high doses tested ( Figure 3 J) but did not reduce pain-related nose wiping behavior or apnea induced by capsaicin ( Figures 3 K and 3L). These results indicate that NMB selectively signals sneezing, but not nasal pain-related behavior.
Although NMB is highly expressed in trigeminal ganglia (TG), it is also detected in several brain regions, including the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) ( Li et al., 2016 29. Li, P. ∙ Janczewski, W.A. ∙ Yackle, K. ... The peptidergic control circuit for sighing Nature. 2016; 530 :293-297 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wada et al., 1990 51. Wada, E. ∙ Way, J. ∙ Lebacq-Verheyden, A.M. ... Neuromedin B and gastrin-releasing peptide mRNAs are differentially distributed in the rat nervous system J. Neurosci. 1990; 10 :2917-2930 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether NMB is released from primary sensory neurons to mediate sneezing, we first stimulated TG neurons with the sneeze-inducing chemicals histamine and capsaicin and found that both compounds elicited significant NMB release from TG neurons ( Figures 4 A and 4B). We then performed microinjection of NMB-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the V1 division of TG, where most nasal sensory neurons are located ( Figure 4 C). The knockdown of Nmb in TG significantly reduced sneezing responses compared with pre-treatments and scrambled siRNA controls ( Figures 4 D and S3 ), indicating that NMB in sensory neurons is required for transmitting sneeze signals. In contrast, siRNA knockdown of Nmb in RTN did not affect sneezing responses ( Figure 4 E), suggesting that NMB plays distinct roles in the nasal sensory neurons and central RTN. To confirm the site of NMB action in signaling sneezing, we also generated Trpv1 Cre/+ ; Nmb flox/flox mice in which Nmb was conditionally knocked out in Trpv1-lineage sensory neurons ( Figure 4 F). Trpv1 Cre/+ ; Nmb flox/flox mice displayed significant reductions in their sneezing responses to capsaicin, histamine, and allergens ( Figure 4 G). These results demonstrate that NMB is released from sensory neurons to signal sneezing.
The essential role of NMB in signaling sneezing suggests the involvement of NMB-sensitive postsynaptic neurons within the sneeze-evoking region (i.e., the central recipient zone of nasal sensory neurons; see the diagram in Figure 5 A). Indeed, capsaicin-induced sneezes led to a significantly increased expression of c-Fos within the sneeze-evoking region of WT mice, but not Nmb -deficient mice ( Figures 5 B and 5C), suggesting NMB-dependent transmission to the sneeze-evoking region. We further examined the role of NMB-sensitive postsynaptic neurons in signaling sneezing. Studies have shown that NMB-saporin efficiently ablates NMB-sensitive neurons ( Mishra et al., 2012 35. Mishra, S.K. ∙ Holzman, S. ∙ Hoon, M.A. A nociceptive signaling role for neuromedin B J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :8686-8695 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wan et al., 2017 55. Wan, L. ∙ Jin, H. ∙ Liu, X.Y. ... Distinct roles of NMB and GRP in itch transmission Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :15466 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microinjection of NMB-saporin into the sneeze-evoking region abolished the sneezing responses to capsaicin and histamine ( Figure 5 D), suggesting that NMB-sensitive postsynaptic neurons mediate sneezing.
NMB acts by binding to its high-affinity cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptor, NMB receptor (NMBR) ( Wada et al., 1991 52. Wada, E. ∙ Way, J. ∙ Shapira, H. ... cDNA cloning, characterization, and brain region-specific expression of a neuromedin-B-preferring bombesin receptor Neuron. 1991; 6 :421-430 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further tested whether NMBR is required for signaling sneeze. NMBR-deficient mice displayed significantly reduced sneezing responses to chemical and allergen stimuli ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Importantly, after sneeze-evoking stimulations, the c-Fos signal was barely detectable in the sneeze-evoking region of Nmbr −/− mice ( Figures 5 G and 5H), confirming the indispensable role of NMB-NMBR interaction in transmitting the sneeze-related signal.
Sneezing is a reflex generated by central respiratory neurons. However, the sneeze-evoking region does not overlap with any reported respiratory regions in the brainstem. Hence, we hypothesize that NMBR + neurons further project to the central respiratory groups. To identify the projection targets of NMBR + neurons, we conducted axonal tracing of NMBR + neurons utilizing Nmbr eGFP reporter line ( Wan et al., 2017 55. Wan, L. ∙ Jin, H. ∙ Liu, X.Y. ... Distinct roles of NMB and GRP in itch transmission Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :15466 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). NMBR + neurons account for 9.1% ± 0.92% of total neurons in the sneeze-evoking region and comprise a highly restricted population ( Figure 6 A). Strikingly, we found that NMBR-GFP + axons richly innervate the cVRG, but not other respiratory regions, including the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG), pre-Bötzinger complex, and Bötzinger complex ( Figures 6 B and S4 ). Immunostaining for the presynaptic markers synaptophysin-1 indicates that NMBR + axons synapse with neurons in cVRG ( Figure 6 C). To confirm that NMBR-GFP + axons in cVRG originate from NMBR + neurons in the sneeze-evoking region, but not other brain regions, we microinjected Alexa-Fluor-555-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB; neuronal tracer) into cVRG of Nmbr eGFP mice for retrograde axonal tracing. The CTB-labeled NMBR-GFP + neurons are localized within the sneeze-evoking region and absent from other brain regions, including the pre-Bötzinger complex and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) ( Figures 6 D and 6E). These anatomical studies reveal that NMBR + neurons in the sneeze-evoking region project directly to cVRG and synapse with neurons within cVRG.
cVRG contains mostly expiratory neurons that transmit excitatory drive to spinal motor neurons that control internal intercostal and abdominal expiratory muscles ( Ezure et al., 2003 14. Ezure, K. ∙ Tanaka, I. ∙ Saito, Y. Brainstem and spinal projections of augmenting expiratory neurons in the rat Neurosci. Res. 2003; 45 :41-51 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Iscoe, 1998 22. Iscoe, S. Control of abdominal muscles Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 56 :433-506 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shiba et al., 2007 44. Shiba, K. ∙ Nakazawa, K. ∙ Ono, K. ... Multifunctional laryngeal premotor neurons: their activities during breathing, coughing, sneezing, and swallowing J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :5156-5162 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). To confirm the functional connections between NMBR + neurons and cVRG neurons, we tested whether cVRG neurons receive the synaptic input from NMBR + neurons by conducting electrophysiological recording of brainstem slices. Pharmacological activation of NMBR + neurons using NMB peptide evoked robust action potential (AP) firing in 30% of cVRG neurons (6 out of 20 neurons recorded; Figures 7 A–7C). As a negative control, cVRG neurons in the brainstem slices from Nmbr −/− mice displayed no response to the same NMB treatment (0 out of 14 neurons recorded; Figures 7 A and 7B). Our electrophysiological recordings confirm the functional connections between NMBR + neurons and cVRG neurons.
Since NMBR + neurons receive the sensory inputs from nasal sensory neurons, we further tested whether cVRG neurons are excited by sneeze-inducing stimuli. We activated sensory neurons using capsaicin and found that it elicited robust AP firing in 31.8% of cVRG neurons from WT mice (7 out of 22 neurons recorded; Figures 7 D–7F) but weak or no AP firing from Nmb −/− mice (1 neuron with weak AP firing out of 13 neurons recorded; Figures 7 D and 7E).
To determine the behavioral consequence of activating cVRG neurons via NMBR + axons, we microinjected NMB peptide directly into the cVRG region. In vivo activation of NMBR + axons innervating cVRG induces significant sneezing responses compared with the vehicle control ( Figure 7 G). Importantly, this sneeze-inducing effect was not observed in Nmbr −/− mice ( Figure 7 G), confirming the specificity of NMB for NMBR and NMBR + axons in vivo .

Section: Discussion

The sneezing reflex is beneficial to our health by rapidly removing noxious environmental irritants and pathogens from our airway. However, in the context of diseases, it can be annoying (e.g., hay fever) and even life-threatening in patients who are at high risk for lung herniation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or aneurysm rupture ( Baydin et al., 2005 2. Baydin, A. ∙ Nural, M.S. ∙ Güven, H. ... Acute aortic dissection provoked by sneeze: a case report Emerg. Med. J. 2005; 22 :756-757 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bradley et al., 1982 6. Bradley, Jr., W.G. ∙ Bank, W.O. ∙ Fischbeck, K.H.

Nomani, A.Z. ∙ Rajput, H.M. ∙ Iqbal, M. ... Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to forceful sneeze Case Rep. Neurol. Med. 2015; 2015 :896732 PubMed Google Scholar ). Sneezing also represents an important mechanism of disease transmission by generating and spreading huge numbers of infectious droplets. Despite its importance in medicine and public health, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying sneezing have remained elusive.
Our study identifies the peptidergic neurotransmission pathway mediating the sneezing reflex ( Figure 7 H). Although the anatomical location of the sneeze-evoking region has been defined in the brainstems of both cats and humans ( Hersch, 2000 20. Hersch, M. Loss of ability to sneeze in lateral medullary syndrome Neurology. 2000; 54 :520-521 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Nonaka et al., 1990 38. Nonaka, S. ∙ Unno, T. ∙ Ohta, Y. ...

Seijo-Martínez, M. ∙ Varela-Freijanes, A. ∙ Grandes, J. ... Sneeze related area in the medulla: localisation of the human sneezing centre? J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2006; 77 :559-561 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), it was unknown which neuronal population in this region signals sneezing. Using a reverse screening strategy, we reveal that NMBR + neurons are required for mediating sneezing induced by chemical irritants and allergens. This finding not only helps fill the gap in our knowledge of how the activation of nasal sensory fibers triggers the sneezing reflex but also provides a non-respiratory neuronal target for suppressing intractable pathological sneezing, without affecting normal respiration ( Baydin et al., 2005 2. Baydin, A. ∙ Nural, M.S. ∙ Güven, H. ... Acute aortic dissection provoked by sneeze: a case report Emerg. Med. J. 2005; 22 :756-757 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bradley et al., 1982 6. Bradley, Jr., W.G. ∙ Bank, W.O. ∙ Fischbeck, K.H.

Nomani, A.Z. ∙ Rajput, H.M. ∙ Iqbal, M. ... Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to forceful sneeze Case Rep. Neurol. Med. 2015; 2015 :896732 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although studies have shown the electrical activities of various respiratory neurons during fictive sneezing of cats ( Batsel and Lines, 1978 1. Batsel, H.L. ∙ Lines, A.J. Discharge of respiratory neurons in sneezes resulting from ethmoidal nerve stimulation Exp. Neurol. 1978; 58 :410-424 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jakus et al., 1985 23. Jakus, J. ∙ Tomori, Z. ∙ Stránsky, A. Activity of bulbar respiratory neurones during cough and other respiratory tract reflexes in cats Physiol. Bohemoslov. 1985; 34 :127-136 PubMed Google Scholar ; Orem and Brooks, 1986 39. Orem, J. ∙ Brooks, E.G. The activity of retrofacial expiratory cells during behavioral respiratory responses and active expiration Brain Res. 1986; 374 :409-412 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wallois et al., 1997 54. Wallois, F. ∙ Bodineau, L. ∙ Macron, J.M. ... Role of respiratory and non-respiratory neurones in the region of the NTS in the elaboration of the sneeze reflex in cat Brain Res. 1997; 768 :71-85 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), which respiratory population receives inputs from the sneeze-evoking region and drives sneezing remained unclear. Our neuronal tracing and electrophysiological recordings reveal that NMBR + neurons synapse with cVRG expiratory neurons. Remarkably, in vivo activation of cVRG neurons via NMBR + axons induces significant sneezing responses. These results demonstrate that cVRG expiratory neurons are the direct projection target of NMBR + neurons in the sneeze-evoking region and are critically required for driving sneezing. However, the sneezing reflex involves both inspiratory and expiratory components. A future priority will be the integration of this peptidergic pathway with other respiratory neurons that influence sneezing. An interesting possibility is that NMBR + neurons may synapse with as-yet-unidentified interneurons that further regulate the activity of respiratory neurons controlling inspiration.
The newly defined sneezing pathway opens a door for future studies as to whether and how pathogens utilize our sneezing reflex to promote their propagation. We have shown that this peptidergic pathway mediates the sneezing responses to mast-cell-dependent allergy (see Figures 3 H and 3I). By exploring published transcriptome data of human mast cells ( Motakis et al., 2014 36. Motakis, E. ∙ Guhl, S. ∙ Ishizu, Y. ..., FANTOM consortium Redefinition of the human mast cell transcriptome by deep-CAGE sequencing Blood. 2014; 123 :e58-e67 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that mast cells express multiple receptors for respiratory virus, including ICAM-1 (the receptor for the majority of human rhinovirus), CD13/aminopeptidase N for several coronaviruses (e.g., prevalent human coronavirus-229E that causes common cold), and dipeptidyl peptidase IV for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ( Dijkman and van der Hoek, 2009 12. Dijkman, R. ∙ van der Hoek, L. Human coronaviruses 229E and NL63: close yet still so far J. Formos. Med. Assoc. 2009; 108 :270-279 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Greve et al., 1989 17. Greve, J.M. ∙ Davis, G. ∙ Meyer, A.M. ... The major human rhinovirus receptor is ICAM-1 Cell. 1989; 56 :839-847 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (971) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li, 2015 28. Li, F. Receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses: a decade of structural studies J. Virol. 2015; 89 :1954-1964 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ). It would be interesting to test whether these receptors mediate mast cell degranulation upon viral binding and result in the release of histamine or other mediators to trigger the sneezing reflex via this neural pathway.
In summary, our findings delineate the peptidergic pathway for chemically and allergy-induced sneezing (NMB + nasal sensory neurons → NMBR + neurons in the sneeze-evoking region → cVRG neurons) and have a direct and immediate impact on treating pathological sneezing and important implications in the fight against infectious respiratory diseases.
Our study reveals the neural pathway that mediates the sneezing reflex. A couple of limitations require further investigation. First, although we have shown that Trpv1 + /NMB + nasal sensory neurons initiate both chemically and allergy-induced sneezing, TrpV1 and NMB are expressed in several transcriptionally and functionally defined subtypes of primary sensory neurons. It is unclear which subset of Trpv1 + /NMB + nasal sensory neurons specifically encode sneezing. We recently identified a subset of Trpv1 + /NMB + nasal sensory neurons that detect mast cell mediators in allergic rhinitis and trigger the sneezing reflex. We are currently testing whether they are the long-sought neuronal population mediating sneezing. Second, as a defense mechanism, the sneezing reflex is not only induced by irritative chemicals and allergens as shown in this study but also triggered by mechanical stimuli, strong light, cold air, and viral infection. We are establishing mouse models for these types of sneezing so that we can investigate whether the identified peptidergic pathway mediates other types of sneezing. Findings from these studies will help determine whether different types of sneezing are mediated by a common neural pathway.

All experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Washington University in Saint Louis, School of Medicine. All animals used in this study were housed on a 12:12 hour light cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Three- to eight-week-old animals used for tissue collection, histology, and electrophysiological recordings. For behavioral experiments and electromyogram recording, all animals were between 8-12 weeks old at the time of testing. C57BL/6J wild-type mice were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups. Transgenic and control mice were assigned to groups based on their genotype. Researchers were blinded to treatment and mouse genotypes throughout testing and data analysis. Both male and female mice were used for electromyogram recording, tissue collection, histology, and electrophysiological recordings. No significant sex related differences were observed or noted.
Sneezing responses in mice were recorded using Buxco Small Animal Whole Body Plethysmography System (DSI, 601-1400-001 Rev11) and analyzed using the FinePointe Software (DSI, 007898-001 Rev03). Test animals were placed in the recording chamber for 10 minutes for acclimation and baseline testing. For chemical-induced sneezing, 0.3 mL of test solution were delivered using an ultrasonic nebulizer (DSI, 08271-001) over 2 min. Reagents used include histamine (Sigma, H7250), capsaicin (Sigma, M2028), and serotonin (Sigma, H9523). NPFF (BACHEM, H-5655.0001, 20 nmol in 2 μl saline) was instilled into each nostril of test mice. Sneezing behavior was recorded for 5 to 10 min. Sneezes, characterized by forceful expirations, were identified from the respiratory trace generated by the FinePointe Software of the WBP system. Apnea was defined as an end-expiratory pause of ≥ 2 average breath durations as in previous studies ( Han et al., 2002 18. Han, F. ∙ Subramanian, S. ∙ Price, E.R. ... Periodic breathing in the mouse J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92 :1133-1140 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamauchi et al., 2008a 57. Yamauchi, M. ∙ Dostal, J. ∙ Kimura, H. ... Effects of buspirone on posthypoxic ventilatory behavior in the C57BL/6J and A/J mouse strains J. Appl. Physiol. 2008; 105 :518-526 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar , 2008b 58. Yamauchi, M. ∙ Ocak, H. ∙ Dostal, J. ... Post-sigh breathing behavior and spontaneous pauses in the C57BL/6J (B6) mouse Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2008; 162 :117-125 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). For video and audio recordings, a video camera (Canon, VIXIA HFG10) was placed on the top of the recording chamber. For simultaneous WBP and audio recordings, a mini audio recorder (aTTo digital, 16 kHz) was placed into the WBP recording chamber. Audio component was extracted from video files and analyzed using the software Audacity.
Ultrasonic recordings were conducted inside an audiometric booth. For mouse sneeze recordings, Microphone (Bruel & Kjaer, type 4134) was adjusted near the snout of the test mouse. For tail snip induced vocalization, mice were gently restrained close to the microphone ( Williams et al., 2008 56. Williams, W.O. ∙ Riskin, D.K. ∙ Mott, A.K. Ultrasonic sound as an indicator of acute pain in laboratory mice J. Am. Assoc. Lab. Anim. Sci. 2008; 47 :8-10 PubMed Google Scholar ). All sound recordings were collected using the BNC-2110 recorder (National Instruments), which is sensitive to frequencies up to 100 kHz, and were written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) consisted of I/O ports of data acquisition cards (PCI-6731 and PCI-4052e, National Instruments) and peripheral circuits. Sound signals were analyzed using MATLAB.
Mast cell-dependent allergy in mice was adapted from our previous study ( Han et al., 2013 19. Han, L. ∙ Ma, C. ∙ Liu, Q. ... A subpopulation of nociceptors specifically linked to itch Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :174-182 Crossref Scopus (435) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 0.02% ovalbumin (OVA, Sigma, A5503) in sterile PBS (w/vol) was emulsified with an equal volume of Imject Alum (Thermo Scientific, 77161). Mice received i.p. injection of 200 μL OVA/Imject Alum mixture on the 1 st and 11 th day. For acute allergic model, sneezing responses were recorded for 10 min after nasal challenge with OVA (2 μL, 10%) on day 14. For chronic allergic model, sensitized animals were challenged daily with intranasal instillation of OVA (2 μL, 10%) under isoflurane anesthesia for five days (from day 14 to 18). Sneezing responses were tested immediately after nasal challenge with OVA on day 19.
Rhizotomy of mouse AEN was performed using an intra-orbital approach as previously described ( Panneton et al., 2006 40. Panneton, W.M. ∙ Gan, Q. ∙ Juric, R. Brainstem projections from recipient zones of the anterior ethmoidal nerve in the medullary dorsal horn Neuroscience. 2006; 141 :889-906 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, anesthetized adult mice were secured in a custom-made stereotaxic apparatus to immobilize the head during the procedure. A dorsal incision was made in the skin from bregma to the anterior of the nose to expose both sides of the medialis orbits. The AEN was seen entering the anterior ethmoidal foramen medially after retracting the eyeball laterally. Rhizotomy was accomplished after careful isolation of the AEN nerve. In the sham group, AEN was isolated without rhizotomy. After the surgery, mice were provided buprenorphine-SR (0.5 mg/kg s.c, once) and carprofen (5 mg/kg i.p, every eight hours for one day) for pain relief. Sneezing reflexes were tested two weeks after surgery.
Electromyogram (EMG) recording of sneeze-related muscle movement was conducted according to the protocol adapted from a previous study ( Satoh et al., 1998 41. Satoh, I. ∙ Shiba, K. ∙ Kobayashi, N. ... Upper airway motor outputs during sneezing and coughing in decerebrate cats Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using IX-BIO8 biopotential recorder and LabScribe software (iWorx Systems Inc., Sn#R27196), EMGs were recorded in anesthetized adult mice via bipolar stainless steel wire electrodes implanted into the diaphragm and external oblique abdominus, respectively. Anesthesia depth was set at a level where animals were fully restrained but still produced sneezing-related muscle movements in response to nasal mechanical stimulation. Muscle movements were recorded for three minutes after saline or capsaicin (12 μM) challenges. To measure muscle activity, EMG signals sampled at 1000 Hz were digitally rectified and integrated. Muscular contractions that significantly increase over regular respiratory movement and interrupt the respiratory rhythm were counted as sneezing-related responses as described in previous study ( Satoh et al., 1998 41. Satoh, I. ∙ Shiba, K. ∙ Kobayashi, N. ... Upper airway motor outputs during sneezing and coughing in decerebrate cats Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To degenerate or desensitize Trpv1 + fibers from the nose, resiniferatoxin (Sigma, R8756, 50 ng in 2 μL saline) or capsaicin (Sigma, M2028, 60 ng in 2 μL saline) was instilled into each nostril of ketamine/xylazine anesthetized mice. Sneezing behavior was tested five days after resiniferatoxin treatments and two days after capsaicin treatments.
Nasal secretions of adult mice were tested using phenol red thread (PRT) tests. Three minutes after saline or capsaicin (12 μM) challenge, Diagnostic threads (Zone-Quick, Menicon Co., Ltd) were placed inside the nostril for 15 s. The absorption of nasal mucus fluid by the thread was measured by the length of the color change (due to pH change) as indicated by the manual.
Adult mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine cocktail and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (w/vol). The nose was dissected by trimming away the lower jaw and surrounding tissues, then post-fixed in 4% PFA on ice for 2 hours. The nasal tissue was incubated in a decalcification buffer (250 mM EDTA in 30% sucrose/PBS) for two days at 4°C, with buffer changes every 12 hours. After decalcification, the nose was immersed in OCT (Sakura, 4583) and placed in a vacuum chamber for 2 hours to allow OCT to fill the nasal cavity. Afterward, embedded nose tissues were frozen for sectioning. For PGP9.5 staining, nose sections were blocked in 10% goat serum (vol/vol) for 1 hour and incubated with the primary antibody rabbit anti-PGP9.5 (Abcam, ab10404; 1:1000 in 0.2% PBST) solution overnight at 4°C. After rinse, the sections were incubated with the secondary antibody anti-Rabbit IgG - Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, A11008, Lot# 1797971; 1:500 in 0.2% PBST) for 2 hours at room temperature.
Trpv1-PLAP staining was adapted from our previous study ( Liu et al., 2007 31. Liu, Q. ∙ Vrontou, S. ∙ Rice, F.L. ... Molecular genetic visualization of a rare subset of unmyelinated sensory neurons that may detect gentle touch Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10 :946-948 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, nose sections were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min on ice and rinsed with HBSS before PLAP staining. Endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity was blocked by incubation at 65°C in HBSS for 2 hours. After incubation, slides were washed in sequence with HBSS, B1 buffer (0.1 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl), and freshly prepared B3 buffer (0.1 M Tris pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl 2 ). PLAP activity was then visualized by incubation with 37.5 μg/mL nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (Sigma, N6876), 175 μg/mL 5–bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate disodium salt (Sigma, B6149) in B3 buffer at room temperature until signals appeared. PLAP reaction was stopped by rinsing the sections in HBSS and fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C for 4 hours.
Adult mice were anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine cocktail and were placed under a stereoscopic microscope. Intranasal instillation of WGA-Alexa Fluor 488 (10 μg in 2 μL PBS, Molecular Probes, W11261) was performed using a fine glass capillary. Trigeminal ganglia were dissected and dissociated two days after instillation. Neurons were purified using a 15% BSA density gradient column as previously described ( Li et al., 2019 30. Li, F. ∙ Yang, W. ∙ Jiang, H. ... TRPV1 activity and substance P release are required for corneal cold nociception Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5678 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). WGA labeled cells were isolated manually using a custom made cell-picking setup comprising of a Leica DMi6000 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Buffalo Grove, IL) and a Narishige MMO-202ND micromanipulator (Amityville, NY). WGA labeled cells were identified visually under the microscope, captured, ejected into PCR tubes containing 10 μL of lysis buffer and RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen, 18080200), and flash frozen and stored at −80°C until cDNA synthesis.
cDNA was generated using Invitrogen SuperScript III CellsDirect cDNA Synthesiss Kit (Invitrogen, 18080200) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. DNase digestion was performed for all samples. RT-PCR was performed using 2 μL of cDNA and QIAGEN HotStarTaq Polymerase (QIAGEN, 203203). Genomic DNA, obtained from single neuron, was used as the negative control. cDNA from whole trigeminal ganglion lysate was used as the positive control. Gene specific primers and annealing temperatures are listed in the Table S2 .
Mice were acclimated in the recording chamber for 30 min before treatment. Capsaicin solution (0.5 nmol in 2 μL saline) was instilled into each nostril. Wiping behavior was videotaped for 5 min immediately after instillation.
To detect NMB release from sensory neurons, TG neurons were dissociated and seeded at high density on the 7 mm glass window of a glass-bottomed culture dish (MatTek Corporation). Neurons were cultured at 37°C for 24 hours and were gently rinsed twice with warm Ca 2+ - and Mg 2+ -free HBSS before test. To activate the neurons, 50 μL of CIB containing vehicle or stimulants were gently added onto the neurons and incubated at 37°C for 5 min before the supernatant was collected. NMB concentration in the supernatant was then measured by ELISA (LifeSpan Biosciences, Cat#:LS-F4262) using the manufacturer’s supplied standards and their recommended protocol.
siRNA knockdown efficiency was evaluated using HEK293 cells transfected with Nmb plasmid (OriGene Technologies, MR200598). 200ng of plasmid with either Nmb -siRNA (15 pmol in 250 μL, M-046334-01-0005, Dharmacon) or scramble-siRNA (15 pmol in 250 μL, D-001206-14-05, Dharmacon) were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. 24 hours after transfection, Nmb mRNA expression was quantified by RT-qPCR.
In vivo knockdown of Nmb was accomplished using siRNA microinjections. All injections were performed in ketamine/xylazine anesthetized mice using a Digital Stereotaxic apparatus (Leica, Model# 39477001). 5 μL of 0.4 μg/μL siRNA targeting Nmb (Dharmacon, M-046334-01-0005) or nontargeting scrambled controls (Dharmacon, D-001206-14-05) in nuclease free water were mixed with 5 μL of 1.45 μg/μL RVG-9R (Bachem, H-7502.0500) ( Kumar et al., 2007 25. Kumar, P. ∙ Wu, H. ∙ McBride, J.L. ... Transvascular delivery of small interfering RNA to the central nervous system Nature. 2007; 448 :39-43 Crossref Scopus (1106) PubMed Google Scholar ) in 10% glucose and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After incubation, the siRNA/RVG mixture (200 nL) was injected into the V1 division of trigeminal ganglion or retrotrapezoid nucleus region via a custom-made 32 gauge, 500 nL neuros-syringe (Hamilton Co.) controlled by a SMARTouch controller (World Precision Instruments, Model 40220); and repeated on the contralateral side. Coordinates for V1 division were: 0.7 mm anterior to bregma, 6.0 mm ventral from surface, ± 1.5 mm from midline. Coordinates for retrotrapezoid nucleus region were: 6.4 mm posterior to bregma, 4.75 mm ventral from surface, ± 1.3 mm from midline. Sneezing responses were tested 4 days after siRNA injection.
Brainstems of mice were collected after 4% PFA perfusion and post-fixed for 4 hours on ice. After cryoprotected in 30% (w/v) sucrose for two nights at 4°C, brainstem was immerged into OCT and sectioned at 50 μm using the cryostat for free-floating section staining. Sectioned tissues were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 hour and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After washing with PBST, secondary antibodies were applied for 2 hours at room temperature. Fluorescence images were taken using Nikon C2 confocal system. Primary antibodies including: rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, A11122, Lot# 1925070; 1:1000), rabbit anti-c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-52, Lot# B0112; 1:1000), mouse anti-NeuN (MilliporeSigma, MAB377, Lot# 3205920; 1:1000), goat anti-WGA (Vector Laboratories, AS-2024, Lot# T1112; 1:1000), guinea pig anti-Synaptophysin 1 (Synaptic System, 101 004; 1:200). Secondary antibodies including: goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor-488 (Invitrogen, A11008, Lot# 1797971; 1:500), goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor-555 (Invitrogen, A21429, Lot# 1683674; 1:500), Goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor-Cyanine5 (Invitrogen, A10524, 1:500), Cy3 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705165147, Lot# 148575; 1:500), goat anti-guinea pig IgG-Alexa Fluor-555 (Invitrogen, A21435; 1:500).
WT mice were anesthetized by ketamine / xylazine and secured in the stereotaxic apparatus (Leica, Model# 39477001). NMB-saporin (Advanced Targeting Systems, Cat. #IT-70; 50 ng in 50 nL) or blank-saporin (Advanced Targeting Systems, Cat. #IT-21; 50 ng in 50 nL) was injected into the spinal trigeminal nucleus region via the coordinates (−7.60 mm posterior to bregma, −6.70 mm ventral from surface, ± 1.50 mm from midline).
Alexa 555 conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB-555, Invitrogen, C34776, Lot# 2086750; 100 ng in 50 nL) was injected into the cVRG of Nmbr eGFP/+ mice. The coordinates were: −5.60 mm posterior to lambda, −1.30 mm ventral from the brainstem surface, ± 1.30 mm from midline. Five to seven days after injection, brainstems were collected for sectioning and immunofluorescence staining.
Male mice (14-21 days old) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated at the cervical spinal level. The brainstem was removed and placed in ice cold solution containing (in mM): Sucrose 209, KCl 2, NaH 2 PO 4 1.25, MgCl 2 5, CaCl 2 0.5, NaHCO 3 26 and glucose 10, saturated with 95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 . Brainstem was vertically embedded in agar and transverse sliced (350 μm per slice) from caudal to rostral using a Vibratome (Vibratome Series 3000 Plus Tissue Sectioning System). Slices were allowed to recover at 34°C for 30 min in holding artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): NaCl 92, KCl 2.5, NaH 2 PO 4 1.25, NaHCO 3 30, MgCl 2 2, CaCl 2 2, glucose 25 and HEPES 20, saturated with 95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 . Slices were placed at room temperature for one hour prior to recording. After incubation, slices were placed in a recording chamber continuously superfused with oxygenated recording ACSF containing (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 2.5, NaH 2 PO 4 1.25, NaHCO 3 24, MgCl 2 1, CaCl 2 2, glucose 12.5 and HEPES 5. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were performed on cVRG region of brainstem slices using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier and pCLAMP 10.5 software (Molecular Devices). The internal solution contained the following (in mM): K + -gluconate 130, NaCl 10, MgCl 2 1, EGTA 0.2, HEPES10, Mg-ATP 1, Na-GTP 5 with an osmolarity of 290–300 mOsm and a pH that was adjusted to 7.25 using KOH.
WT and Nmbr −/− mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and secured in the stereotaxic apparatus (Leica, Model# 39477001). NMB peptide (TOCRIS, 1908; 1 pmol in 100 nL) was injected into the cVRG region. The coordinates were: −5.60 mm posterior to lambda, −1.30 mm ventral from the brainstem surface, ± 1.30 mm from midline. Sneezing test was performed 10 min after injection, which allowed recovery from isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were euthanized after test and injection sites were checked to exclude the off-target injections.
All data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Sample sizes were chosen based on the “Sample size determination” ( Dell et al., 2002 11. Dell, R.B. ∙ Holleran, S. ∙ Ramakrishnan, R. Sample size determination ILAR J. 2002; 43 :207-213 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ), analysis of relevant prior studies and our pilot studies, and considerations including technical restrains, resource availability, and ethical use. No datapoint or result from a successful experiment was excluded from analysis. Unless otherwise defined n numbers in figure legends represent biological replicates (the number of mice). Statistical significance for the two groups was determined using a two-tailed Student’s t test. For three or more groups, statistical significances were tested using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests. Difference between groups were considered statistically significant if p ≤ 0.05. All statistical testing were performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).
