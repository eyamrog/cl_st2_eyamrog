Title: Generation of a Broadly Useful Model for COVID-19 Pathogenesis, Vaccination, and Treatment


Abstract: Summary

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a virulent pneumonia, with >4,000,000 confirmed cases worldwide and >290,000 deaths as of May 15, 2020. It is critical that vaccines and therapeutics be developed very rapidly. Mice, the ideal animal for assessing such interventions, are resistant to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we overcome this difficulty by exogenous delivery of human ACE2 with a replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5-hACE2). Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice developed pneumonia characterized by weight loss, severe pulmonary pathology, and high-titer virus replication in lungs. Type I interferon, T cells, and, most importantly, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) are critical for virus clearance and disease resolution in these mice. Ad5-hACE2-transduced mice enabled rapid assessments of a vaccine candidate, of human convalescent plasma, and of two antiviral therapies (poly I:C and remdesivir). In summary, we describe a murine model of broad and immediate utility to investigate COVID-19 pathogenesis and to evaluate new therapies and vaccines.

Section: Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus, emerged in China as the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe pneumonia with systemic manifestations. COVID-19 has been classified as a pandemic by the WHO. COVID-19 has the transmissibility of coronaviruses (CoV) that cause the common cold and the virulence of two previously described zoonotic human highly pathogenic respiratory CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome)-CoV. These characteristics help explain the pathogenicity of COVID-19 and highlight the urgent need to develop broadly useful experimental animal models for additional studies. Although SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses ACE2 to enter cells, mouse ACE2 (mACE2) does not sensitize cells for infection ( Zhou et al., 2020 44. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.L. ∙ Wang, X.G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14578) PubMed Google Scholar ).
As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the need to understand mechanisms of cell and tissue injury, and to apply this knowledge to therapeutics, increases. Animal models of infection play important roles in such discoveries, with mice being the most widely used animal. Mice offer the convenience of small size and wide availability. Previous studies in laboratory mice facilitated our understanding of SARS and MERS. Mice infected with human SARS-CoV developed mild disease, but because SARS-CoV, unlike SARS-CoV-2, could infect mice, it was possible to develop a mouse-adapted virus that caused severe disease. Rodent-adapted SARS-CoV were isolated by several laboratories and used in a wide variety of studies ( Nagata et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2007 28. Nagata, N. ∙ Iwata, N. ∙ Hasegawa, H. ...

MERS-CoV, like SARS-CoV-2 does not naturally infect mice. However, we and others showed that by providing the human receptor (DPP4) by transduction with a replication-deficient adenovirus, or by transgenic or “knocked-in” human DPP4 expression, mice were sensitized for MERS-CoV infection ( Cockrell et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016, 2017; Pascal et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2014 8.

Further mouse adaptations resulted in isolation of highly pathogenic viruses that recapitulated the disease seen in human CoV infections ( Cockrell et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017 8. Cockrell, A.S. ∙ Yount, B.L. ∙ Scobey, T. ... A mouse model for MERS coronavirus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome Nat.

Mouse-adapted MERS coronavirus causes lethal lung disease in human DPP4 knockin mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E3119-E3128 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Prior to the isolation of rodent-adapted SARS-CoV, several transgenic mouse lines were developed for studies of SARS ( McCray et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2007; Yoshikawa et al., 2009 25. McCray, Jr., P.B. ∙ Pewe, L. ∙ Wohlford-Lenane, C. ... Lethal infection of K18-hACE2 mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus J. Virol. 2007; 81 :813-821 Crossref Scopus (716) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Yang, X.H. ∙ Deng, W. ∙ Tong, Z. ... Mice transgenic for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 provide a model for SARS coronavirus infection Comp. Med. 2007; 57 :450-459 PubMed Google Scholar 38.

Differential virological and immunological outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in susceptible and resistant transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 J. Virol. 2009; 83 :5451-5465 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because SARS-CoV-2 also binds to the hACE2 receptor, these mice may have immediate applications. Indeed, Bao and colleagues recently re-purposed their hACE-2 transgenic mice for studies of SARS-CoV-2 ( Bao et al., 2020 3. Bao, L. ∙ Deng, W. ∙ Huang, B. ... The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice Nature. 2020; 2020 :7 Google Scholar ). Although these mice are potentially useful, SARS-CoV-2 replication in these mice was suboptimal (less than 10 3 Log 10 TCID 50 per 100 μL of mouse lungs), and weight loss and lung pathological changes were minimal ( Bao et al., 2020 3. Bao, L. ∙ Deng, W. ∙ Huang, B. ... The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice Nature. 2020; 2020 :7 Google Scholar ). Most importantly, many studies would also benefit from using genetically modified mice, which would require time-consuming backcrossing to meet the demand. Development of a murine infection system in which all mice were easily and rapidly sensitized to SARS-CoV-2 infection would circumvent this problem and would be very useful for these and other studies. Here, we show that providing hACE2 by adenovirus transduction sensitizes a broad range of immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice for SARS-CoV-2 infection, expediting studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the development of multiple interventions.

Section: Results

The adenoviral vector expressing hACE2 under the control of the CMV promoter was generated as previously described ( Jia et al., 2005; McCray et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2014 17. Jia, H.P. ∙ Look, D.C. ∙ Shi, L. ... ACE2 receptor expression and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection depend on differentiation of human airway epithelia J. Virol. 2005; 79 :14614-14621 Crossref Scopus (662) PubMed Google Scholar 25. McCray, Jr., P.B. ∙ Pewe, L. ∙ Wohlford-Lenane, C. ... Lethal infection of K18-hACE2 mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus J. Virol. 2007; 81 :813-821 Crossref Scopus (716) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Zhao, J. ∙ Li, K. ∙ Wohlford-Lenane, C. ... Rapid generation of a mouse model for Middle East respiratory syndrome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :4970-4975 Crossref Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ). When we transduced mouse 17CL-1 cells with Ad5-hACE2, but not Ad5-empty (an adenoviral vector with no expression cassette) (MOI = 100), hACE2 expression was detected by immunoblot and flow cytometry ( Figures 1 A and 1B). High titers of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the supernatants of 17CL-1 cells transduced with Ad5-hACE2, but not Ad5-empty ( Figure 1 C), after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ad5 can transduce a large percentage of pulmonary epithelial cells and robustly express the encoded protein of interest ( Crystal et al., 1994; Nabel, 2004 9. Crystal, R.G. ∙ McElvaney, N.G. ∙ Rosenfeld, M.A. ... Administration of an adenovirus containing the human CFTR cDNA to the respiratory tract of individuals with cystic fibrosis Nat. Genet. 1994; 8 :42-51 Crossref Scopus (811) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Nabel, G.J. Genetic, cellular and immune approaches to disease therapy: past and future Nat. Med. 2004; 10 :135-141 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, we modified a previously described approach, to provide hACE2, by transducing mice with Ad5-hACE2 ( Zhao et al., 2014b 42. Zhao, J. ∙ Li, K. ∙ Wohlford-Lenane, C. ... Rapid generation of a mouse model for Middle East respiratory syndrome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :4970-4975 Crossref Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ). When we transduced 6-to-8-week-old BALB/c mice intranasally with 2.5 × 10 8 PFU Ad5-hACE2, we observed hACE2 expression predominantly in the alveolar epithelium with occasional positive cells in the airway epithelium ( Figure 1 D). Five days later, mice received 1 × 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 and were monitored over a 10-day time course. Control mice received the Ad5-empty vector. Ad5-hACE2 transduced BALB/c mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed ruffled fur, hunching, and difficulty breathing beginning 2 days post infection (d.p.i.). The mice lost up to ∼20% of their body weight in the first 4–6 days of infection, and virus grew to high titers in lung tissue and gradually declined over the course of the infection ( Figure 1 E), similar to SARS-CoV infection of BALB/c mice ( Roberts et al., 2007 32. Roberts, A. ∙ Deming, D. ∙ Paddock, C.D. ... A mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus causes disease and mortality in BALB/c mice PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3 :e5 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly treated C57BL/6 mice followed an almost identical course, with 10%–15% weight loss and highest virus titers at 1–2 d.p.i. ( Figure 1 F). As expected, robust viral antigen was detected in the lungs of mice transduced with Ad5-hACE2 but not Ad5-empty control ( Figure 1 G). Examination of lung tissues from both strains of mice demonstrated a variety of lesions including perivascular to interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates, necrotic cell debris, and alveolar edema ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Consistent with the histological findings, examination of gross lung specimens from infected Ad5-hACE2-transduced mice revealed increased vascular congestion and hemorrhage, with the most severe changes observed at 5 d.p.i. ( Figure 1 J).
To investigate the possible contributions of interferon (IFN)-I signaling to COVID-19 lung disease, we transduced wild-type and IFNAR −/− C57BL/6 mice with Ad5-hACE2, then infected them with SARS-CoV-2. As shown in Figure 2 , IFNAR −/− C57BL/6 mice had delayed virus clearance and diminished inflammation, although this did not translate into a significant difference in weight loss, suggesting that IFN signaling might have a variety of roles in virus clearance, cellular infiltration, and clinical disease, as was recently postulated for STAT2 in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Boudewijns et al., 2020 5. Boudewijns, R. ∙ Thibaut, H.J. ∙ Kaptein, S.J.F. ... STAT2 signaling as double-edged sword restricting viral dissemination but driving severe pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 A–2C). In comparison, the absence of type II IFN (IFN-γ) signaling had no effect on clinical disease, virus clearance, or pathological changes ( Figures 2 A–2C). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-infected, Ad5-hACE2 transduced STAT1 −/− C57BL/6 mice exhibited greater weight loss, enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration into the lungs, and delayed virus clearance ( Figures 2 A–2C). A key role for STAT1 in protection against SARS-CoV was also previously reported ( Frieman et al., 2010 12. Frieman, M.B. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Morrison, T.E. ... SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but a type I, II and III interferon receptor independent mechanism PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6 :e1000849 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although further studies are warranted, the disparity in phenotypes between IFNAR −/− and STAT1 −/− C57BL/6 could reflect the protective effects of IFN-λ, an additional antiviral and immunomodulatory cytokine that signals through STAT1 ( Lazear et al., 2019; Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2020 20. Lazear, H.M. ∙ Schoggins, J.W. ∙ Diamond, M.S. Shared and Distinct Functions of Type I and Type III Interferons Immunity. 2019; 50 :907-923 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (634) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Prokunina-Olsson, L. ∙ Alphonse, N. ∙ Dickenson, R.E. ... COVID-19 and emerging viral infections: The case for interferon lambda J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200653 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further examine the role of IFN-I in protection against SARS-CoV-2, we treated mice intranasally with poly I:C, a potent inducer of IFN-I, 6 h prior to infection. Poly I:C treatment resulted in significantly diminished clinical disease and induced more rapid kinetics of initial virus clearance ( Figure 2 D). Together, our results suggest that IFNs have antiviral and immunomodulatory activity that affects SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome.
To further investigate the innate immune and host defense responses of mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using RNA extracted from lungs of Ad5-Empty and Ad5-ACE2 transduced BALB/c mice at 2 d.p.i. Abundant SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected solely in Ad5-ACE2 transduced mice indicating robust viral replication in their lungs ( Figure 3 A). In total, 3,056 genes were differentially expressed, with 2,142 genes upregulated and 914 genes downregulated in Ad5-ACE2-transduced mice compared with Ad5-Empty-transduced mice ( Figure 3 B). Most upregulated genes were associated with inflammation pathways and innate and adaptive immune response pathways, including ISGs, immune cell activation, and migration ( Figure 3 C). In particular, CD4 and CD8 transcript abundance were significantly upregulated, indicating T cell migration from periphery to the site of infection ( Figure 3 D). B cell and macrophage abundance as determined by CD79b and CD68 expression showed a trend toward increased migration. It is possible that since RNA-seq was performed at 2 d.p.i., B cell and macrophage infiltration could occur at later time points p.i. ( Figure 3 D). Several cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-15, IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL10 were upregulated, consistent with observations in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 3 D) ( Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020 7. Chen, G. ∙ Wu, D. ∙ Guo, W. ... Clinical and immunological features of severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019 J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :2620-2629 Crossref Scopus (3387) PubMed Google Scholar 15. Huang, C. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, X. ... Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China Lancet. 2020; 395 :497-506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33242) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we found that expression of platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFb) was upregulated in Ad5-ACE2 transduced mice. PDGFb is secreted by platelets during coagulation, and also by activated macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells during tissue damage and regeneration ( Figure 3 D) ( Bennett and Schultz, 1993; Deuel et al., 1988; Wahl et al., 1989 4. Bennett, N.T. ∙ Schultz, G.S. Growth factors and wound healing: Part II. Role in normal and chronic wound healing Am. J. Surg. 1993; 166 :74-81 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar 11. Deuel, T.F. ∙ Silverman, N.J. ∙ Kawahara, R.S.

Role of growth factors in inflammation and repair J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40 :193-199 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). In summary, these results demonstrate that Ad5-ACE2-transduced mice reproduced some key manifestations observed in COVID-19 patients.
Virus-specific T cells are critical for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV clearance ( Zhao et al., 2016, 2010 41. Zhao, J. ∙ Zhao, J. ∙ Perlman, S. T cell responses are required for protection from clinical disease and for virus clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected mice J. Virol. 2010; 84 :9318-9325 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Zhao, J. ∙ Zhao, J. ∙ Mangalam, A.K. ... Airway Memory CD4(+) T Cells Mediate Protective Immunity against Emerging Respiratory Coronaviruses Immunity. 2016; 44 :1379-1391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine the role of T cell responses in COVID-19, we depleted CD4 + and CD8 + T cells individually and together from Ad5-hACE2-sensitized BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results indicate that optimal virus clearance required both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice ( Figure 4 A). To further characterize the T cell response in infected mice, peptide pools encompassing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and the accessory protein ORFs (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 10) were synthesized and used to stimulate cells harvested from infected mouse lungs. We found that CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes were predominantly located in the N protein and the S1 region of the S protein, respectively, in BALB/c mice ( Figure 4 B). The virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses peaked at 8 d.p.i. in BALB/c mice, as expected ( Figures 4 C and 4D). In addition, Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice also produced neutralizing antibodies in sera after infection as determined by a plaque reduction neutralizing test (PRNT 50 ) ( Figure 4 E). To evaluate the utility of Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice in vaccine evaluation, we developed Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particles (VRPs) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (VRP-S), transmembrane (VRP-M), nucleocapsid (VRP-N), and envelope (VRP-E) proteins as previously described ( Deming et al., 2006 10. Deming, D. ∙ Sheahan, T. ∙ Heise, M. ... Vaccine efficacy in senescent mice challenged with recombinant SARS-CoV bearing epidemic and zoonotic spike variants PLoS Med. 2006; 3 :e525 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunization with VRP-S reduced SARS-CoV-2 titers by greater than 3 logs in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice by 1 d.p.i. ( Figure 4 F). This protection was largely mediated by anti-S antibodies, which blocked virus attachment, as passive transfer of sera from VRP-S-immunized mice also accelerated the kinetics of virus clearance in naive mice ( Figure 4 G). In contrast, sera from mice immunized with VRP-M, VRP-N, or VRP-E failed to enhance the kinetics of virus clearance.
Several therapies have been proposed to treat COVID-19, including transfer of plasma from patients who have recovered from the infection. We obtained pooled plasma from 3 patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (FRNT 50 titer = 1:1,000) as well as plasma from a healthy donor, 3 SARS survivors (PRNT 50 titer against SARS-CoV = 1:140), and 2 MERS convalescent patients (FRNT 50 titer against MERS-CoV = 1:2,183). Administration of 150 μL of plasma one day prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection prevented weight loss and lung tissue histological changes and accelerated the rate of virus clearance ( Figures 5 A and 5B). More rapid clearance was not observed after treatment with pooled plasma from SARS survivors or MERS survivors.
Remdesivir, an adenosine nucleotide triphosphate analog, was granted Emergency Use Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, based on recently published results ( Grein et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2020 13.

Structural basis for inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from SARS-CoV-2 by remdesivir Science. 2020; eabc1560 Published online May 1, 2020 Crossref Scopus (858) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment with remdesivir one day prior to infection and continued dosing of 25 mg/kg twice daily resulted in decreased weight loss, significantly accelerated virus clearance, and diminished cellular infiltration of lung tissue in infected Ad5-hACE2-transduced mice ( Figures 5 C and 5D).

Section: Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic, with associated high levels of morbidity and mortality and enormous economic losses, has made the discovery of vaccines and anti-viral treatments imperative. Here, we show that Ad5-hACE2-transduced mice develop pneumonia after infection with SARS-CoV-2, thus overcoming the natural resistance of mice to the infection. We show that the infection of transduced mice protocol is very reproducible. SARS-CoV-2 infection of these mice resulted in high levels of viral replication in the lungs. While the infection is non-lethal, Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice are useful for evaluation of vaccines and anti-viral therapies. We used these mice to show critical roles for IFN-I and STAT1 signaling and virus-specific antibodies and T cells in the host response to SARS-CoV-2. We also illustrate the utility of the system by demonstrating the efficacy of patient-derived convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and poly I:C as therapeutic interventions and its use in vaccine evaluation.
While other animals including Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and rhesus monkeys can support virus replication ( Chan et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020 6.

Age-related rhesus macaque models of COVID-19 Animal Model Exp Med. 2020; 3 :93-97 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ), laboratory mice offer practical advantages including costs, multiple strains, and ease of genetic manipulation. Mice that are genetically modified to express hACE2 may be also useful. However, transgenic expression of hACE2 may not sensitize infection only in the correct organ, as shown in SARS and MERS transgenic mouse models ( Agrawal et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; McCray et al., 2007 1.

Virol. 2007; 81 :813-821 Crossref Scopus (716) PubMed Google Scholar ). Development of adenovirus vectors to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor in the mouse lungs was efficient and rapid, resulting in the generation of an easily reproducible murine model for SARS-CoV-2 within 2–3 weeks. This compares favorably with the much longer time (several months to years) required to develop and breed sufficient numbers of hACE2-transgenic or hACE2-knockin mice for studies. Even longer time periods are required to cross or genetically modify these mice to study COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our strategy allows sensitization of all mouse strains and all genetically modified mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This facile and widely available approach helps address the current urgent need for small animal models for COVID-19.
Mice transduced with Ad5-hACE2 do not develop severe disease. They also do not develop extrapulmonary manifestations of disease. Studies of pathogenesis, especially of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) will require development of infection models that include mild and severe COVID-19. This will likely involve development of mice “knocked in” for hACE2 expression and probably mouse adaptation of the virus by serial passage through mouse lungs.

Written informed consent was obtained from all recovered COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients and approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and the King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Jeddah, the two sites of patient enrollment. We also obtained Institutional Review Board approval from the Health Commission of Guangdong Province to use the anonymized healthy blood donor samples described in this study.
Specific pathogen-free 6-10 week old male and female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and 5-6 month old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co. (Hunan, China) or Charles River Laboratories and maintained in the Animal Care Facilities at the Guangzhou Medical University and University of Iowa. IFN-γ −/− , STAT1 −/− and IFNAR −/− mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine). All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Guangzhou Medical University and of the University of Iowa. The SARS-CoV-2 strains used in this research were isolated from COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou and in Washington state (Accession numbers: MT123290, MN985325.1), and passaged on Vero E6 and Calu-3 2B4 cells. African Green monkey kidney-derived Vero E6 cells and 17CL-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Calu-3 2B4 cells were grown in MEM (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 20% FBS. The human serotype 5 adenoviral vector expressing human ACE2 under the control of the CMV promoter was previously described ( Anderson et al., 2000; Jia et al., 2005 2. Anderson, R.D. ∙ Haskell, R.E. ∙ Xia, H. ... A simple method for the rapid generation of recombinant adenovirus vectors Gene Ther. 2000; 7 :1034-1038 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar 17. Jia, H.P. ∙ Look, D.C. ∙ Shi, L. ... ACE2 receptor expression and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection depend on differentiation of human airway epithelia J. Virol. 2005; 79 :14614-14621 Crossref Scopus (662) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Remdesivir (Cat. No. HY-104077) was purchased from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ). Poly I:C was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). A set of 20-mer peptides encompassing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural [S1, S2, N, and ME encompassing the N- and C-terminal portions of the spike (S) glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and the transmembrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins], and 6 accessory proteins [ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10] and overlapping by 10 amino acids was synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and used for stimulation of T cells.
Recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2) with or without a C9 tag were prepared and used as previously described ( Anderson et al., 2000; Jia et al., 2005 2. Anderson, R.D. ∙ Haskell, R.E. ∙ Xia, H. ... A simple method for the rapid generation of recombinant adenovirus vectors Gene Ther. 2000; 7 :1034-1038 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar 17. Jia, H.P. ∙ Look, D.C. ∙ Shi, L. ... ACE2 receptor expression and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection depend on differentiation of human airway epithelia J. Virol. 2005; 79 :14614-14621 Crossref Scopus (662) PubMed Google Scholar ). 17Cl-1 cells were transduced with Ad5-hACE2 or Ad5-Empty at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 100 for 4 h at 37°C. Extracts were prepared 48 h post transduction. Identical amounts of protein were separated on an 8% SDS/PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were stained with a mouse anti-human hACE2 antibody (clone OTI2G7, Origene, Rockville, MD), a mouse anti-C9 antibody (clone Rho 1D4, EMD Millipore, Temecula, CA), or a mouse anti–β-actin (Cat: A01546, Genscript, Nanjing). Proteins were detected using a SuperSignal West Pico Trial Kit (Thermo Scientific). For infection, 17Cl-1 cells were transduced with Ad5-hACE2 or Ad5-Empty for 48 h at MOI = 100. The transduced cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI = 0.5. Culture supernatants and cells were collected at the indicated time points and analyzed for infectious virus by a focus forming assay (see below). The Ad5-hACE2 or Ad5-Empty vectors are available from the University of Iowa Viral Vector Core ( https://medicine.uiowa.edu/vectorcore/ ).
Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and transduced intranasally with 2.5 × 10 8 FFU of Ad5-ACE2 or Ad5-Empty in 75 μL DMEM. Five days post transduction, mice were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 (1 × 10 5 PFU) in a total volume of 50 μL DMEM. Mice were monitored weighted daily. All work with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in the Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) Laboratories of Guangzhou Customs District Technology Center or the University of Iowa.
Virus or lung homogenate supernatants were serially diluted in DMEM. Vero E6 cells in 12 well plates were inoculated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 1 h with gentle rocking every 15 min. After removing the inocula, plates were overlaid with 1.2% agarose containing 4% FBS. After further incubation for 2 days, overlays were removed, and plaques were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Viral titers were calculated as PFU per gram tissue.
In some experiments, virus was titered using an FFA since it is high throughput as compared to the traditional plaque assay. Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates one day before infection. Virus cultures or lung homogenate were serially diluted and used to inoculate Vero E6 cells at 37°C for 1 h. Inocula were then removed before adding 125 μL 1.6% carboxymethylcellulose warmed to 37°C per well. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with a rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody (Cat. No.: 40143-T62, Sino Biological, Inc. Beijing), followed by an HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cat. No.: 109-035-088, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. West Grove, PA). The foci were visualized by TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and counted with an ELISPOT reader (Cellular Technology Ltd. Cleveland, OH). Viral titers were calculated as FFU per ml or per gram tissue.
Serum samples were serially diluted in DMEM and mixed with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 containing 80-100 PFU. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, aliquots were added to Vero E6 cells in 12-well plates and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 1 h. After removing the inocula, plates were overlaid with 1.2% agarose containing 4% FBS. After further incubation for 2 days, overlays were removed, and plaques were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. The procedure of foci reduction neutralization test (FRNT 50 ) is similar to PRNT, except that the plates were stained according to FFA above.
VRPs expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) or GFP were constructed as previously described ( Deming et al., 2006 10. Deming, D. ∙ Sheahan, T. ∙ Heise, M. ... Vaccine efficacy in senescent mice challenged with recombinant SARS-CoV bearing epidemic and zoonotic spike variants PLoS Med. 2006; 3 :e525 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were primed and boosted (3 weeks after priming) with 1x10 5 Infectious Units (IU) of VRP-S, VRP-N, VRP-M, VRP-E, or VRP-GFP in the left footpad in 50 μL PBS or intranasally (i.n.) in 50 μL DMEM after light anesthesia with isoflurane. Sera were collected 1-2 weeks after booster. Mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 three weeks post VRP vaccination.
For depletion of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.5 mg anti-CD4 antibody (clone GK1.5, Cat. No.: BE003-1, Bio X Cell, Lebanon, NH) or 0.5 mg anti-CD8 antibody (clone 2.43, Cat. No.: BE0061, Bio X Cell, Lebanon, NH), respectively at days −2 and 0 p.i. Poly I:C (80 μg in 50 μL of PBS, Cat. No. 31852-29-6, Invivogen, San Diego, CA) was administered intranasally to Ad5-hACE2 sensitized mice 6 h prior to infection.
Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points. BALF was acquired by inflating lungs with 1 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium via cannulation of the trachea followed by lavaging four times. Cells in the BALF were collected by centrifugation.
The following monoclonal antibodies were used: rat anti-mouse CD8α-Alexa 488 (clone 53-6.7, Cat. No.: 100723, Biolegend, San Diego, CA), anti-mouse CD16/32-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone 93, Cat. No.: 45-0161-82, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), anti-mouse CD4-eFluor 450 (cloneRM4-5, Cat. No.: 48-0042-82 eBioscience, San Diego, CA), anti-mouse TNF-PE (cloneMP6-XT22, Cat. No.: 12-7321-82Bioscience, San Diego, CA), anti-mouse IFN-γ-APC (cloneXMG1.2, Cat. No.: 17-7311-82, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and mouse anti-C9 antibody (clone Rho 1D4, Cat. No.: MAB5356, EMD Millipore). For intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), lymphocytes were cultured in 96-well dishes at 37°C for 5-6 h in the presence of 2 μM peptide pool and brefeldin A (BD Biosciences). Cells were then labeled for cell-surface markers, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD Biosciences), and labeled with anti-IFN-γ and anti-TNF antibody. All flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD FACSVerse and were analyzed using FlowJo software.
Animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by zinc formalin. Lungs were fixed in zinc formalin. For routine histology, tissue sections (∼4 μm each) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To detect virus antigen, sections were incubated with blocking reagent (Rodent Block-M, Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA) incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody to hACE2 (1:100 dilution, mouse anti-hACE2, MAB933,R&D Systems), then incubated with a secondary (polymer-based) kit (Mouse Envision, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), followed by incubation with DAB+ (Dako) or with an antibody to SARS-CoV-2 N protein (1:500 dilution, a monoclonal antibody to the SARS-N protein which also identifies the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 provided by Professor John Nicholls, The University of Hong Kong), then incubated with Rabbit Envision (Dako) and diaminobenzidine (Dako). Tissues were examined and scored in a post-examination method of masking by a boarded experimental pathologist ( Meyerholz and Beck, 2018 26. Meyerholz, D.K. ∙ Beck, A.P. Principles and approaches for reproducible scoring of tissue stains in research Lab. Invest. 2018; 98 :844-855 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ordinal scores for lesion parameters were assigned using the following tiers: 0 = within expected limits; 1 - uncommon, < 5%; 2 - detectable in 5%–33%; 3 - detectable in 34%–66% and 4 - detectable in > 66% of lung fields (200x objective magnification).
Plasma samples were collected from 3 patients 1 month following recovery from COVID-19 (FRNT 50 = 1000). Plasma was collected from 3 patients who were 15 years post recovery from SARS-CoV infection (PRNT 50 = 140). Plasma was collected from 2 patients who were 1-2 months post recovery from MERS (FRNT 50 = 2183).
Total RNA was extracted from infected lungs using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and ribosomal RNA removed using QIAseq FastSelect-rRNA HMR Kits (QIAGEN, Germany). Fragmented RNA (average length approximately 200 bp) was subjected to first strand and second strand cDNA synthesis followed by adaptor ligation and enrichment with a low-cycle according to the instructions of NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA). The purified library products were evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and Qubit®2.0(Life Technologies, USA). The libraries were paired-end sequenced (PE150, Sequencing reads were 150 bp) at Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China) using Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform.
Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome mm10 with bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 19. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (32362) PubMed Google Scholar ), and RSEM ( Li and Dewey, 2011 21. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13399) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to quantify the reads mapped to each gene. Gene expression was normalized by EDASEQ ( Risso et al., 2011 31. Risso, D. ∙ Schwartz, K. ∙ Sherlock, G. ... GC-content normalization for RNA-Seq data BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :480 Crossref Scopus (522) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differentially expressed genes were obtained using DESeq2 (version 1.10.1) ( Love et al., 2014 24. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45395) PubMed Google Scholar ), a cutoff of Q-value < 0.05 and log2 (fold-change) > 1 was used for identify differentially expressed genes. All differentially expressed mRNAs were selected for GO analyses clusterProfiler ( Yu et al., 2012 39. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.-G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (17345) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other analysis was performed using glbase ( Hutchins et al., 2014 16. Hutchins, A.P. ∙ Jauch, R. ∙ Dyla, M. ... glbase: a framework for combining, analyzing and displaying heterogeneous genomic and high-throughput sequencing data Cell Regen. (Lond.). 2014; 3 :1 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ).

ANOVA and Student’s t tests were used to analyze differences in mean values between groups using GraphPad Prism 7. All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and were corrected for multiple comparisons. P value s of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
