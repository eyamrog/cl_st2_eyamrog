Title: Recombination of repeat elements generates somatic complexity in human genomes


Abstract: Summary

Non-allelic recombination between homologous repetitive elements contributes to evolution and human genetic disorders. Here, we combine short- and long-DNA read sequencing of repeat elements with a new bioinformatics pipeline to show that somatic recombination of Alu and L1 elements is widespread in the human genome. Our analysis uncovers tissue-specific non-allelic homologous recombination hallmarks; moreover, we find that centromeres and cancer-associated genes are enriched for retroelements that may act as recombination hotspots. We compare recombination profiles in human-induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiated neurons and find that the neuron-specific recombination of repeat elements accompanies chromatin changes during cell-fate determination. Finally, we report that somatic recombination profiles are altered in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a link between retroelement recombination and genomic instability in neurodegeneration. This work highlights a significant contribution of the somatic recombination of repeat elements to genomic diversity in health and disease.

Section: Introduction

Repeat elements accounting for more than half of the human genome can alter its sequence by retrotransposition and recombination, two processes considered to be a driving force in human evolution and disease ( Bourque et al., 2018 9.

Genet. 2006; 79 :41-53 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is an important trigger for the recombination of repeat elements. The regions flanking the DSBs are at first converted to single strands by end resection, and the local assembly of the DNA repair complex is then followed by a search for sequences homologous to the exposed strands to be used as a template ( Piazza and Heyer, 2019a 52. Piazza, A. ∙ Heyer, W.-D. Homologous recombination and the formation of complex genomic rearrangements Trends Cell Biol. 2019; 29 :135-149 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). If equal loci on sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes are available and are selected as a donor, the resolution of the DNA break can be neutral; conversely, if homologous sequences of non-allelic loci are selected as donors, the repair leads to non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) with potentially catastrophic consequences on genome integrity ( Chen et al., 2007 12.

Savocco, J. ∙ Piazza, A. Recombination-mediated genome rearrangements Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2021; 71 :63-71 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alu and L1 elements in particular, together occupying ∼30% of the human genome, have often been found at the breakpoints of NAHR events associated with cancer and other genetic disorders ( Beck et al., 2011 6. Beck, C.R. ∙ Garcia-Perez, J.L. ∙ Badge, R.M. ... LINE-1 elements in structural variation and disease Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

Considering the millions of homologous Alu and L1 copies interspersed throughout the genome of each cell, there are two long-standing questions in the field: how much genomic variation is generated by NAHR, and what is the contribution of different repeat element families to rearrangements caused by NAHR. Although several studies have focused on NAHR and its contribution to diseases ( Elliott et al., 2005 15. Elliott, B. ∙ Richardson, C. ∙ Jasin, M.

Predicting human genes susceptible to genomic instability associated with Alu/Alu-mediated rearrangements Genome Res. 2018; 28 :1228-1242 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), a comprehensive investigation of the somatic recombination of repeat elements in different cells and tissues is unavailable. Here, we examined somatic NAHR of repeats by pairing deep short- and long-read DNA sequencing with a new bioinformatic pipeline. We explored somatic NAHR in a panel of tissues from neurotypical donors and donors affected by neurodegeneration, and we profiled NAHR in a model of neuronal differentiation. Our work reveals that the recombinogenic activity of Alu and L1 elements is an important contributor to somatic structural variants (SVs) in normal and pathological conditions.

Section: Results

To maximize the discovery of Alu- and L1-associated somatic SVs, we optimized an RNA-based capture assay that enriches genomic retroelement sequences prior to sequencing (“capture-seq”; Methods S1 ; adapted from Fisher et al., 2011 21. Fisher, S. ∙ Barry, A. ∙ Abreu, J. ...

Solution hybrid selection with ultra-long oligonucleotides for massively parallel targeted sequencing Nat Biotech. 2009; 27 :182-189 Crossref Scopus (1094) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since young repeats with higher similarity may recombine more than older elements, we designed the capture probes to cover the full sequence of young AluY elements ( Hubley et al., 2016 32. Hubley, R. ∙ Finn, R.D. ∙ Clements, J. ... The Dfam database of repetitive DNA families Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D81-D89 Crossref Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ∼250 bp of the 5′ and 3′ regions of the youngest L1 element consensus sequence (L1HS) ( Baillie et al., 2011 5. Baillie, J.K. ∙ Barnett, M.W. ∙ Upton, K.R. ... Somatic retrotransposition alters the genetic landscape of the human brain Nature. 2011; 479 :534-537 Crossref Scopus (549) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Methods S1 ). The hybridization time of target and probes was reduced from several days in previous capture-seq protocols iterations to 5 min ( Carreira et al., 2016 11. Carreira, P.E. ∙ Ewing, A.D. ∙ Li, G. ...

Endogenous retrotransposition activates oncogenic pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma Cell. 2013; 153 :101-111 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). This allowed a 1-day library production time while retaining a low number of post-enrichment polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycles (n = 12) and optimal enrichment efficiency ( Data S1 ). We performed capture-seq on a panel of post-mortem tissues from 10 neurotypical donors ( Table S1 ). For each donor, we selected available tissues derived from the 3 developmental germ layers: the kidney (mesoderm), the liver (endoderm), and 3 cortical brain regions (the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and parietal cortex; ectoderm). Nuclear preparations from the brain samples were labeled with the neuron-specific antibody NeuN and underwent fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) to separate the neuronal and non-neuronal fractions ( Iwamoto et al., 2011 33. Iwamoto, K. ∙ Bundo, M. ∙ Ueda, J. ... Neurons show distinctive DNA methylation profile and higher interindividual variations compared with non-neurons Genome Res. 2011; 21 :688-696 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matevossian and Akbarian, 2008 48. Matevossian, A. ∙ Akbarian, S. Neuronal nuclei isolation from human postmortem brain tissue J. Vis. Exp. 2008; 914 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A; Data S1 ; Methods S1 ). The paired-end sequencing of capture-seq libraries yielded ∼960 million raw reads ( Table S2 ), and the quality control performed on uniquely mapping reads confirmed the consistent and efficient enrichment of a panel of reference L1HS sequences used as a benchmark in previous studies ( Carreira et al., 2016 11. Carreira, P.E. ∙ Ewing, A.D. ∙ Li, G. ... Evidence for L1-associated DNA rearrangements and negligible L1 retrotransposition in glioblastoma multiforme Mob. DNA. 2016; 7 :21 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Evrony et al., 2012 17. Evrony, G.D. ∙ Cai, X. ∙ Lee, E. ... Single-neuron sequencing analysis of L1 retrotransposition and somatic mutation in the human brain Cell. 2012; 151 :483-496 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Data S1 ). In protocols for the enrichment of repeat elements based on capture probes, the repeated nature of the genomic targets overpowers the specificity of the probes. For instance, in our dataset, we also detected the comprehensive and highly reproducible enrichment of L1 and Alu elements that were not originally targeted by experimental design. We took advantage of this complexity by extending downstream analyses to all Alu (n = 1,126,901; Deininger, 2011) and primate-specific L1 subfamilies (n = 122,626; Khan et al., 2006) 35. Khan, H. ∙ Smit, A. ∙ Boissinot, S. Molecular evolution and tempo of amplification of human LINE-1 retrotransposons since the origin of primates Genome Res. 2006; 16 :78-87 https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.4001406 Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ( Table S3 ). The median capture rate was 75% ± 3% for Alu and 64% ± 2% for L1 ( Figures1 B and 1C); therefore, capture-seq enriched evenly in all libraries a majority of Alu and primate-specific L1 sequences.
To find NAHR events in Alu and L1 capture-seq libraries, we developed TE-reX, a new bioinformatics pipeline based on LAST ( Kiełbasa et al., 2011 36. Kiełbasa, S.M. ∙ Wan, R. ∙ Sato, K. ... Adaptive seeds tame genomic sequence comparison Genome Res. 2011; 21 :487-493 Crossref Scopus (859) PubMed Google Scholar ), and designed to identify recombination events from split-aligned reads that join non-allelic repeats at homologous positions ( Figure 1 F). To maximize the stringency of our analyses, we relied solely on NAHR events with low mismapping probability (p ≤ 1e−5) ( Frith and Kawaguchi, 2015 22. Frith, M.C. ∙ Kawaguchi, R. Split-alignment of genomes finds orthologies more accurately Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :106 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). TE-reX identified 2,131,372 Alu and 251,380 L1 NAHR events in capture-seq libraries ( Table S4 ). We flagged as putative somatic the events identified in single capture-seq libraries (Alu = 2,127,834; L1 = 250,127); conversely, the NAHR events found in multiple libraries and joining the same two repeat elements at the same base position with respect to Dfam repeat models ( Hubley et al., 2016 32. Hubley, R. ∙ Finn, R.D. ∙ Clements, J. ... The Dfam database of repetitive DNA families Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D81-D89 Crossref Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ) were flagged as putative polymorphic (Alu = 3,539; L1 = 1,255). The number of events per chromosome was highly correlated with the number of repeats annotated per chromosome ( Figures 1 D and 1E). The relative abundance of Alu NAHR per library exceeded that of L1 NAHR by several folds as expected from the ratio of Alu:L1 elements included in the analysis (∼9:1, Figure 1 G). An estimated count of somatic NAHR events per cell based on the amount of DNA used per library and normalized by sequencing depth showed that the number of NAHR events per sample was higher in the kidney and liver compared with the brain, whereas we did not detect any difference between the neuronal and non-neuronal fractions ( Figures 1 H and 1I).
We validated a subset of NAHR events by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. To avoid the cross-amplification of homologous repeat sequences, we required all targets to have 5′ and 3′ ends non-repeat sequences flanking the recombined repeats in the mapped contigs ( Figure 1 J). Since only 2% of all NAHR events satisfied this requirement, at this stage we were not able to include any putative polymorphic NAHR event in the validation. We designed primers flanking 112 putative somatic NAHR events (79 inter-chromosomal and 33 intra-chromosomal). Of these, 101 were supported by a single contig, 10 by 2 contigs, and 1 by 4 contigs ( Table S5 ). PCR reactions from the respective capture-seq libraries produced amplicons of the expected length for 103/112 targets (92%; Figure 1 J; Data S1 ), and Sanger sequencing confirmed the target identity of 93/103 targets (90%; Figures 1 K and 1L; Table S5 ; Document S2 ). Due to their scarcity, most somatic SVs are not expected to validate in standard PCR from bulk genomic DNA. For 72 putative somatic NAHR, we had sufficient material to attempt direct PCR amplification from the respective bulk DNA. There were 67/72 targets that were not confirmed by PCR in bulk DNA, and 5/72 were amplified and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the panel of 8 DNA samples available for each donor and were therefore flagged as polymorphic ( Data S1 ). This indicated a theoretical 7% false-positive rate across the somatic NAHR dataset. A comparison of genomic location and theoretical genomic size of rearrangements caused by putative somatic NAHR events with polymorphic SVs aggregated in the database of genomic variants (DGVs) ( MacDonald et al., 2014 45. MacDonald, J.R. ∙ Ziman, R. ∙ Yuen, R.K.C. ... The Database of Genomic Variants: a curated collection of structural variation in the human genome Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :D986-D992 Crossref Scopus (891) PubMed Google Scholar ) returned an overlap of 3.4%, a theoretical false-positive rate comparable with the estimate by PCR. As expected, putative polymorphic NAHR events had a higher overlap with SVs in the DGV (12%).
Somatic NAHR events in brain samples were distinguished by a higher rate of intra-chromosomal events compared with kidney and liver samples. Among the 3 tested cortical brain regions, the temporal cortex samples had the highest rate of intra-chromosomal recombination ( Figure 2 A). A comparison of the intra-chromosomal recombination rate of each sample with random Alu and L1 pairs generated in silico confirmed that intra-chromosomal NAHR events were enriched in all chromosomes: the enrichment was higher in brain samples versus kidney and liver samples, and higher in the temporal cortex compared with frontal and parietal cortex ( Figure 2 B). Similarly to what has been reported for meiotic recombination ( Farré et al., 2013 19. Farré, M. ∙ Micheletti, D. ∙ Ruiz-Herrera, A. Recombination rates and genomic shuffling in human and chimpanzee—a new twist in the chromosomal speciation theory Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :853-864 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jensen-Seaman et al., 2004 34. Jensen-Seaman, M.I. ∙ Furey, T.S. ∙ Payseur, B.A. ... Comparative recombination rates in the rat, mouse, and human genomes Genome Res. 2004; 14 :528-538 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li and Freudenberg, 2009 40. Li, W. ∙ Freudenberg, J. Two-parameter characterization of chromosome-scale recombination rate Genome Res. 2009; 19 :2300-2307 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), in all the brain samples the normalized intra-chromosomal recombination rates were negatively correlated with chromosome’s length, with shorter chromosomes having higher rates of recombination than longer chromosomes ( Data S1 ). The relative abundance of somatic NAHR involving young AluY and L1HS elements was overall higher in brain samples ( Figure 2 C). However, separating NAHR involving young repeat elements in its intra-chromosomal and inter-chromosomal components revealed that only the inter-chromosomal NAHR events exhibited tissue-specific differences, whereas the intra-chromosomal NAHR rates of young elements were similar in all samples ( Figure 2 D). Next, we explored the landscape of intra-chromosomal NAHR by calculating the original genomic distance between members of each pair of Alu and L1 elements that we found recombined in the dataset, based on their RepeatMasker annotation. The distance profiles for the kidney and liver samples were overall similar, with ∼95% of the intra-chromosomal recombination involving repeats distanced more than 100 kilobases (kb). By contrast, somatic NAHR in the brain samples showed a significantly higher abundance of proximal intra-chromosomal recombination and this was additionally more pronounced in the temporal cortex than the frontal or parietal cortex ( Figure 2 E). We observed subtle differences between Alu and L1 distance profiles that may be attributed to the different average genomic sizes of the two repeat families ( Data S1 ). The human genome is depleted of inverted proximal Alu pairs, an evolutionary consequence of the genomic instability of close Alu elements in this configuration ( Lobachev et al., 2000 43. Lobachev, K.S. ∙ Stenger, J.E. ∙ Kozyreva, O.G. ... Inverted Alu repeats unstable in yeast are excluded from the human genome EMBO J. 2000; 19 :3822-3830 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stenger et al., 2001 67. Stenger, J.E. ∙ Lobachev, K.S. ∙ Gordenin, D. ... Biased distribution of inverted and direct Alus in the human genome: implications for insertion, exclusion, and genome stability Genome Res. 2001; 11 :12-27 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). The somatic NAHR of inverted proximal repeat elements in our data was more frequent than that of repeats in the direct configuration in all the brain samples, whereas the liver samples showed a mild, opposite bias ( Figure 2 F). Moreover, the bias was dependent on the distance of recombined elements and was undetected in recombined repeat pairs distanced more than 100 kb ( Figure 2 G). These observations confirm at the somatic level that close inverted repeats are a source of genomic instability and that their activity is characterized by tissue specificity. The NAHR of intra-chromosomal direct repeat pairs generates deletions and duplications, with a 2:1 theoretical ratio (e.g., Sasaki et al., 2010 58. Sasaki, M. ∙ Lange, J. ∙ Keeney, S. Genome destabilization by homologous recombination in the germ line Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :182-195 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the NAHR of proximal direct repeats was consistently biased toward deletions: across all samples, the cumulative mean for the deletion:duplication ratio was 2.1, approximating the expected ratio. By contrast, the NAHR of distal direct repeat pairs displayed no bias ( Figure 2 H). A possible interpretation of this finding is that the main homology-based DNA repair mechanisms making use of direct repeats recombination to repair DSBs (single-strand annealing, SSA, and break-induced replication, BIR) become progressively inefficient with increasing distance between the repeats and the DSB ( Bhargava et al., 2016 7.

In agreement with previous reports ( Morales et al., 2015 50. Morales, M.E. ∙ White, T.B. ∙ Streva, V.A. ... The contribution of alu elements to mutagenic DNA double-strand break repair PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1005016 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sen et al., 2006 60.

Genet. 2006; 79 :41-53 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2018 65. Song, X. ∙ Beck, C.R. ∙ Du, R. ... Predicting human genes susceptible to genomic instability associated with Alu/Alu-mediated rearrangements Genome Res. 2018; 28 :1228-1242 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), we detected an enrichment of breakpoints frequency in the 5′ region of recombined inverted Alu elements distanced <100 kb ( Figure 2 I). The enrichment was however absent in the proximal direct Alu pairs ( Figure 2 J) and in the breakpoint profiles of Alu pairs distanced >100 kb, irrespective of their configuration ( Data S1 ). The somatic NAHR of Alu and L1 is therefore characterized by complex tissue-specific and repeat-specific profiles suggestive of differential regulatory mechanisms.
We next investigated the enrichment and depletion of Alu and L1 NAHR events in gene and regulatory regions by comparing the real dataset (“O,” observed) to datasets comprising random permutations of the genomic coordinates of NAHR breakpoints (“E,” expected) ( Data S3 ). We did not observe any enrichment or depletion within the gene body, except for a mild depletion of L1 NAHR events in 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). L1 events were significantly enriched in the transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. A similar trend of enrichment was observed in promoters (annotations from Kundaje et al., 2015 56. Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium ∙ Kundaje, A. ∙ Meuleman, W. ... Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes Nature. 2015; 518 :317-330 Crossref Scopus (4232) PubMed Google Scholar ), in particular across the brain tissues (log 2 O/E ratio 1.5–2.9). By contrast, we observed a depletion of Alu and L1 NAHR within enhancers ( Kundaje et al., 2015 56. Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium ∙ Kundaje, A. ∙ Meuleman, W. ... Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes Nature. 2015; 518 :317-330 Crossref Scopus (4232) PubMed Google Scholar ) across all samples (log 2 O/E ratio −0.4 to −1.2, p < 0.05, two-tailed Student’s t test). Intriguingly, separating the regulatory regions according to their cell type and tissue activity (defined in Kundaje et al., 2015 56. Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium ∙ Kundaje, A. ∙ Meuleman, W. ... Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes Nature. 2015; 518 :317-330 Crossref Scopus (4232) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Data S3 ) showed that the enrichment of L1 NAHR in promoters was prominently attributed to the promoter active in stem cells, independent of the tissues in which the NAHR events were observed. We did not observe consistent enrichment or depletion of somatic NAHR in regulatory regions active in the respectively matched tissues.
To find genomic regions with high recombination activity, we pooled the NAHR events found in all libraries and after binning the genome in non-overlapping bins of 0.1 Mb we normalized the sum of NAHR events in each bin by the number of annotated Alu and L1. The bins with the highest normalized NAHR count were often proximal to centromeres as in the case of chr21, where a cluster of repeat elements, each causing several NAHR events, localized in a genomic region involved in translocations underlying Down syndrome ( Shaw et al., 2008 61. Shaw, S.-W. ∙ Chen, C.-P. ∙ Cheng, P.-J. ... Gene dosage change of TPTE and BAGE2 and breakpoint analysis in Robertsonian Down syndrome J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 53 :136-143 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A, green shaded area).
The top 100 bins with the highest normalized NAHR activity were highly enriched in centromeric regions (69/100, 69% versus 1.3% in all other bins, 386/28,785; p< 2.2e−16, Mann-Whitney U test) ( Figures 3 B and 3C). In the 69 top centromeric bins with the highest normalized NAHR count, chr12, chr19, and chr21 were each represented in 7 genomic bins, followed by chr5 and chr11 (6 bins each). These 5 chromosomes represented ∼50% of the 69 bins ( Table S6 ). The observed frequency of NAHR events with both recombined repeats mapped within or in the proximity of centromeres (centromeres ±1 Mb, “C-C” in Figure 3 D) was higher than expected in all samples and higher for brain samples compared with non-brain samples. By contrast, observed and expected rates for recombination events with only one of two recombined repeats within or in the proximity of centromeres (“C-NC” in Figure 3 D) were similar for all samples. Additionally, in both brain and non-brain samples recombined “C-C” repeat pairs were distinguished by a higher intra-chromosomal recombination rate in comparison with repeat pairs having only one of two recombined repeats within or in the proximity of centromeres (“C-NC,” Figure 3 E). Brain samples had the highest enrichment as expected also from previous observations (e.g., Figure 2 A). In summary, somatic intra-chromosomal NAHR is enriched at human centromeres. Alu and L1 are responsible for recurrent mutations in several cancer types ( Hastings et al., 2009 29. Hastings, P.J. ∙ Lupski, J.R. ∙ Rosenberg, S.M. ...

BRCA1 intronic Alu elements drive gene rearrangements and PARP inhibitor resistance Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5661 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify repeat elements acting as recombination hotspots in the human genome, we used a permutation strategy that estimates whether the observed number of breakpoints within each repeat element is higher than its expected distribution. This approach allowed us also to correct for repeats size. For each repeat, we calculated a Z score by comparing its observed number of breakpoints to its expected distribution from permutations (i.e., null distribution). This Z score can thus be interpreted as a measure of recombination frequency, relative to the null distribution and normalized by the size of an individual element and the number of elements within a subfamily ( Table S7 ). An element with Z score ≥ 2 was interpreted as significantly more frequently recombined (p < 0.05, one-tailed) than the background and was defined as a “hot” element ( Data S1 ). On average, 13% ± 2.6% of all Alu elements and 16% ± 4.9% of all L1 elements included in the analyses of capture-seq data ( Table S3 ) were flagged as recombination hotspots ( Table S7 ). Hot Alu elements were enriched in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes of the COSMIC database ( Sondka et al., 2018 64. Sondka, Z. ∙ Bamford, S. ∙ Cole, C.G. ... The COSMIC Cancer Gene Census: describing genetic dysfunction across all human cancers Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18 :696-705 Crossref Scopus (875) PubMed Google Scholar ) compared with a random dataset generated from other protein-coding genes. The enrichment showed a similar trend in the aggregated data for the 8 samples available for each donor and was highly significant when merging the data for all donors ( Figures 3 F and 3G). By contrast, hot L1 elements were not enriched in COSMIC genes, and the merged L1 NAHR dataset showed depletion from these genes ( Figures 3 H and 3I).
To gain insights into the origins of tissue-specific recombination profiles observed in post-mortem tissues, we exploited an in vitro model of neuronal differentiation ( Liu et al., 2013 42. Liu, Y. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Sauvey, C. ... Directed differentiation of forebrain GABA interneurons from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1670-1679 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ). This protocol allows for the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-progenitor cells within 26 days after which the specific induction toward GABAergic interneurons is started and prolonged for an additional 24 days ( Data S2 ). We performed capture-seq on 3 biological replicas of iPSCs and induced neurons (iNEUs) and sequenced the libraries on the Illumina Miseq platform ( Table S2 ). Although several features of Alu and L1 NAHR did not differ between iPSCs and iNEUs ( Data S2 ), the intra-chromosomal NAHR of repeats distanced <100 kb showed a modest but significant increase in iNEUs compared with iPSCs ( Figure 4 A). The differentiation of iPSCs in iNEUs caused also a sharp change in the correlation between chromosome length and normalized intra-chromosomal recombination rates, with iNEU samples showing a stronger inverse correlation compared with iPSCs ( Figures 4 B and 4C). These results suggested that NAHR of Alu and L1 may accompany chromatin restructuring during cell-fate commitment. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed NAHR in active (“A”) and inactive (“B”) chromatin compartments ( Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009 41. Lieberman-Aiden, E. ∙ van Berkum, N.L. ∙ Williams, L. ... Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome Science. 2009; 326 :289-293 Crossref Scopus (5831) PubMed Google Scholar ) during the iPSC-to-iNEU transition. Using the genomic coordinates of A and B compartments computed from high-resolution chromatin maps of iPSCs and iNEUs ( Lu et al., 2020 44. Lu, L. ∙ Liu, X. ∙ Huang, W.K. ... Robust Hi-C maps of enhancer-promoter interactions reveal the function of non-coding genome in neural development and diseases Mol. Cell. 2020; 79 :521-534.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed a decreased NAHR of Alu and L1 in A compartments mirrored by an increase of NAHR in B compartments in iNEUs compared with iPSCs ( Figures 4 D and 4E). The NAHR of Alu-Alu pairs, with the two Alu respectively located in A-A and A-B, were decreased in iNEUs, whereas NAHR of pairs in B-B was increased compared with iPSCs ( Figure 4 F). The results for L1-L1 NAHR had a similar trend ( Figure 4 G). These findings show that 3D chromatin restructuring during cell-fate commitment is accompanied by changes in NAHR profiles of Alu and L1 elements.
The observation that somatic NAHR is pervasive in normal physiological conditions provokes questions about how this tissue-specific, complex network of recombinations is affected in disease. We extended our investigation of NAHR to sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD) and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We obtained post-mortem tissue samples with equal composition to the main dataset from an equal number of PD and AD donors ( Table S1 ). Sequencing of 159 PD and AD capture-seq libraries yielded ∼960 and ∼990 million raw reads, respectively. The quality control of PD and AD libraries showed capture efficiency and enrichment of Alu and L1 elements comparable with that of control donor libraries ( Data S1 ). Genome-wide annotation and profiling of somatic NAHR events in PD and AD datasets recapitulated the main findings of the control dataset ( Data S2 ). The estimate of the normalized number of NAHR events per cell highlighted some relevant differences among the three groups, the most interesting being a significantly higher count of recombination events in the temporal cortex of AD donors ( Figure 5 A). Recombination hotspots (defined as repeat elements with Z score ≥ 1.7 for the subsampled dataset) were depleted in PD samples compared with control samples. By contrast, the kidney, liver, and parietal cortex NeuN+ of AD samples had more NAHR hotspots than control samples, and PD samples were consistently depleted of NAHR hotspots compared with AD samples. In all groups, non-brain samples showed a depletion of NAHR hotspots compared with brain samples ( Figure 5 B).
Moreover, intra-chromosomal NAHR was increased in the frontal cortex and the NeuN+ fraction of the parietal cortex in PD samples compared with controls. A similar result was observed also for the NeuN+ fractions of frontal and parietal cortex in AD samples ( Figures 5 C and 5D).
We next investigated the enrichment of breakpoints of somatic NAHR events causing duplications, deletions, or inversions in PD- and AD-associated genes. We found that NAHR causing small deletions (<100 kb) were specifically enriched in the PD genes set in the temporal cortex, NeuN- fraction of PD donors ( Figure 5 E; full comparisons set in Data S2 ). NAHR causing intra-chromosomal rearrangements in AD-associated genes were overall enriched in the frontal cortex of AD donors ( Figure 5 F; full comparisons set in Data S2 ). Differential analysis of NAHR breakpoints frequencies in the same PD- and AD-associated genes sets revealed the brain-specific enrichment of NAHR breakpoints in the gene encoding for Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) in AD donors, although the raw count of NAHR events in PSEN1 across all samples was overall low and the p value for the enrichment test did not pass the correction for multiple testing ( Figures 5 G–5H; cumulative fold-change AD versus control in brain samples: 4.1; uncorrected p = 0.0009; FDR-corrected p = 0.07). Collectively, these findings indicate that genome-wide NAHR profiles are altered in a cell- and tissue-specific fashion in neurodegeneration and underline key differences in the genomic distribution of somatic recombination events in PD and AD genomes.
For an independent confirmation that somatic NAHR detected in capture-seq data is not a technical artefact generated by PCR or by any other step of the capture-seq workflow, we performed long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 36 DNA samples from 30 donors on the PromethION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The samples included 30 temporal cortex samples (NeuN + fraction, 10 control donors, 10 PD donors, and 10 AD donors), 3 kidney, and 3 liver samples (all from control donors). This approach allowed us to investigate NAHR events in PCR-free and capture-free conditions, in the same genomic DNA samples used to generate the respective capture-seq libraries. The PromethION platform generated ∼397 million high-quality reads with an average length of 8.1 kb and average genome coverage of 33-folds ( Table S2 ). Since the preparation of these WGS libraries did not include the enrichment of any repeat sequence, we expanded the search for NAHR to all repeat elements annotated in GRCh38. Overall, TE-reX identified 544,916 NAHR events across all 36 libraries, and the count of events per library was positively correlated with the number of reads per library ( Data S2 ). A normalized count of NAHR events per million reads showed that among the control libraries, the liver samples had the highest count of NAHR, whereas a comparison of the temporal cortex NeuN+ libraries showed that the highest NAHR count belonged to PD samples ( Figure 6 A). The vast majority of the NAHR events was from Alu and L1 (respective averages of 84% and 14%), indicating a minor contribution of other repeats to NAHR in the human genome (∼2%). We detected small but statistically significant differences in the relative proportion of recombined elements in the temporal cortex compared with the liver for control samples, and in PD samples compared with control and AD samples ( Figure 6 B). WGS libraries with a higher NAHR count had a higher proportion of events found in single libraries; conversely, libraries with low NAHR count had higher rates of recombination events found in the same configuration in two or more libraries ( Data S2 ). The mean supporting reads count for events found in two or more libraries was n = 5.5, whereas for unique events it was n = 1. A comparison of all NAHR events found in WGS and in capture-seq libraries returned 1,511 events found in the same configuration in both datasets, all of which flagged as putative polymorphic: this number represented the 0.3% and the 0.02% of the entire WGS and capture-seq NAHR datasets, respectively ( Figure 6 C). The mean supporting reads count for these shared events was 9.2. We did not find any putative somatic NAHR event detected in both respective WGS and capture-seq libraries, suggesting that the bulk of NAHR of repeat elements in the human genome is represented by rare somatic events with a low copy number.
Out of the 1,511 shared NAHR events, 1,449 were intra-chromosomal, and for 526/1,449 (36%), we found comparably sized SVs annotated in the DGV. By comparison, we found matching SVs for 3,409 out of 123,742 intra-chromosomal NAHR events detected in single WGS libraries (2.8%), a theoretical false-positive rate close to that calculated for putative somatic NAHR events in the capture-seq dataset (3.4%). Although capture-seq data did not provide sufficient sequence information to design PCR primers for putative polymorphic NAHR, taking advantage of the long DNA reads in the WGS dataset, we designed primers for 20 putative polymorphic NAHR events identified by both approaches. PCR from representative bulk DNA samples produced clean amplicons for 17/20 targets (85%, Data S2 ), and capillary sequencing confirmed the sequence identity of 16/17 amplicons (94%, Table S5 ; Document S2 ). For 13 of these verified targets, we performed additional PCR from the panel of 8 DNA samples available for a single representative donor per target, and the amplification of equal PCR products in all 8 samples confirmed the polymorphic status of these targets ( Data S2 ).
WGS and capture-seq libraries are distinguished by significant technical differences including the capture of repeat elements, PCR, reads length, sequencing depth, and sequencing platform. Nevertheless, the genome-wide profiling of NAHR events annotated in WGS libraries remarkably confirmed some of the properties of somatic NAHR observed in capture-seq data. The comparison of intra- and inter-chromosomal NAHR rates for control samples revealed a significant enrichment of intra-chromosomal NAHR in the temporal cortex NeuN+ compared with kidney and liver samples, and the temporal cortex NeuN+ PD samples had lower intra-chromosomal rates compared with the control and AD samples ( Figure 6 D). Normalized intra-chromosomal NAHR rates were higher than the background distribution in all samples, with small but statistically significant differences ( Figure 6 E). As described also for brain samples in capture-seq data, the normalized recombination rates of individual chromosomes were negatively correlated with the respective chromosome’s length, but in WGS data, this was true also for non-brain samples ( Data S2 ). Temporal cortex NeuN+ samples of AD donors had higher normalized intra-chromosomal NAHR rates compared with the control and PD samples ( Data S2 ). The NAHR of intra-chromosomal proximal repeats was prominent in all samples, including non-brain tissues, in contrast to capture-seq data ( Data S2 ). The NAHR of intra-chromosomal proximal repeat pairs in WGS data was biased for repeats in an inverted configuration, with a few differences across different samples. The temporal cortex NeuN+ of PD donors, in particular, displayed a lower bias compared with the control and AD donors. The bias was absent in distal intra-chromosomal recombined repeat pairs for all but two individual libraries ( Figure 6 F).
Additionally, we observed a cumulative deletion:duplication ratio of ∼2.4 for NAHR of intra-chromosomal proximal direct repeats and the bias absent in recombined direct repeats with d > 100 kb, validating the same result in the capture-seq dataset and adhering to the theoretical prediction ( Figure 6 G). In this analysis, we also detected a higher rate of deletions caused by the NAHR of proximal repeats in the temporal cortex NeuN+ samples of the PD donors compared with respective samples in the control and AD donors. The analysis of NAHR at centromeres confirmed that NAHR involving repeats both located within centromeric genomic bins (centromeres ±1 Mb) were observed more frequently than expected, compared with NAHR with a single repeat in a centromeric region ( Figure 6 H). The genome-wide analysis of normalized NAHR activity in individual genomic bins confirmed that the top 100 bins with the highest NAHR events count were enriched in centromeric regions compared with all other bins (67/100 versus 391/28,792, p = 2.2e−16, Mann-Whitney U test) ( Figures 6 I and 6J). In conclusion, the annotation of NAHR of Alu and L1 in somatic tissues by long DNA reads corroborated the discovery of NAHR events by TE-reX in capture-seq data. These data demonstrate that somatic NAHR of repeat elements can be effectively investigated in long-read WGS data and set a reference for future studies of somatic NAHR in health and disease.

Section: Discussion

Here, we show that somatic mosaicism caused by recombination of Alu and L1 in the human genome is extensive and complex, adding a new page to the developing story of how a myriad of genomic variants coexist in the same individual. In the capture-seq data of neurotypical donors, we estimate ∼4 and ∼1.4 NAHR somatic events per cell in non-brain and brain tissues, respectively. These figures are coherent with estimates of somatic retrotransposition in the brain ( Erwin et al., 2016 16. Erwin, J.A. ∙ Paquola, A.C.M. ∙ Singer, T. ... L1-associated genomic regions are deleted in somatic cells of the healthy human brain Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19 :1583-1591 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ; Evrony et al., 2016 18. Evrony, G.D. ∙ Lee, E. ∙ Park, P.J. ... Resolving rates of mutation in the brain using single-neuron genomics eLife. 2016; 5 :e12966 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ) and suggest an important contribution of somatic NAHR of Alu and L1 to genome diversity; however, dedicated and more sensitive technical approaches will be required to confirm these figures at the single-cell level. The tissue-specific differences in somatic NAHR profiles described in this work could stem from several factors, including the preferential usage of different DNA repair pathways, chromatin architecture, epigenetic modifications, and developmental differences. NAHR differences in iPSCs and differentiated neurons suggest that the specific recombination profiles observed in post-mortem samples may be generated in progenitor cells during early developmental stages. This notion is supported by the homogeneity of intra-sample profiles and in the lack of fundamental differences in the NeuN− and NeuN+ fractions in the control donor samples. It is nevertheless an open question whether tissue-specific recombination profiles are a cause or consequence of cell-fate determination. Since the differentiation of stem cells into a given progenitor cell type triggers specific changes in chromatin conformation ( Bonev et al., 2017 8. Bonev, B. ∙ Mendelson Cohen, N. ∙ Szabo, Q. ...

Dixon, J.R. ∙ Jung, I. ∙ Selvaraj, S. ... Chromatin architecture reorganization during stem cell differentiation Nature. 2015; 518 :331-336 Crossref Scopus (1104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2020 44. Lu, L. ∙ Liu, X. ∙ Huang, W.K. ... Robust Hi-C maps of enhancer-promoter interactions reveal the function of non-coding genome in neural development and diseases Mol. Cell. 2020; 79 :521-534.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is possible to imagine that the DNA damage occurring throughout this process may engage the recombination of repeat elements and result in discrete patterns of recombination. Several lines of evidence have illustrated the existence of a complex relationship between DNA damage and neuronal development ( Alt and Schwer, 2018 1. Alt, F.W. ∙ Schwer, B. DNA double-strand breaks as drivers of neural genomic change, function, and disease DNA Repair. 2018; 71 :158-163 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). The repair of DNA double-strand breaks is instrumental for normal neurogenesis ( Gao et al., 1998 23. Gao, Y. ∙ Sun, Y. ∙ Frank, K.M. ... A critical role for DNA end-joining proteins in both lymphogenesis and neurogenesis Cell. 1998; 95 :891-902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ), and post-mitotic neurons retain the ability to express components of both the non-homologous ends joining (NHEJ) and the homologous recombination pathway upon induction of DNA damage ( Merlo et al., 2005 49. Merlo, D. ∙ Di Stasi, A.M.M. ∙ Bonini, P. ... DNA repair in post-mitotic neurons: a gene-trapping strategy Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12 :307-309 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), although at present it is unknown whether NAHR of repeats may participate in the repair of DNA DSBs generated by the activation of developmental programs or by normal brain physiology ( Stott et al., 2021 68. Stott, R.T. ∙ Kritsky, O. ∙ Tsai, L.-H. Profiling DNA break sites and transcriptional changes in response to contextual fear learning PLoS One. 2021; 16 :e0249691 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the profiles of intra-chromosomal NAHR and the enrichment of specific rearrangements caused by NAHR in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s brains may be consequential to disease- and cell-type-specific alterations of both DNA damage and DNA repair.
The extent of the repeats-driven recombination detected in short- and long-reads data poses the problem of compatibility of the observed rearrangements with genome fitness. Somatic NAHR events are responsible for a vast array of deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. Inter- and intra-genic regulatory elements are likely to be affected by these somatic NAHR events, with potential cell-specific effects on close and distant chromatin architecture and gene expression ( Rigau et al., 2019 55. Rigau, M. ∙ Juan, D. ∙ Valencia, A. ... Intronic CNVs and gene expression variation in human populations PLOS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1007902 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spatial genome organization at the single-cell level is characterized by high variability ( Finn et al., 2019 20. Finn, E.H. ∙ Pegoraro, G. ∙ Brandão, H.B. ... Extensive heterogeneity and intrinsic variation in spatial genome organization Cell. 2019; 176 :1502-1515.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), and on the basis of its pervasiveness, we speculate that somatic NAHR may contribute to this heterogeneity.
Seminal works on NAHR mediated by transposons in yeast postulated that this class of rearrangements may be associated with evolution and disease in the human genome ( Argueso et al., 2008 3. Argueso, J.L. ∙ Westmoreland, J. ∙ Mieczkowski, P.A. ... Double-strand breaks associated with repetitive DNA can reshape the genome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :11845-11850 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hoang et al., 2010 30. Hoang, M.L. ∙ Tan, F.J. ∙ Lai, D.C. ... Competitive repair by naturally dispersed repetitive DNA during non-allelic homologous recombination PLoS Genet. 2010; 6 :e1001228 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Building on this hypothesis, we propose that stochastic somatic recombination of Alu and L1 may occasionally prime the genome of individual cells at vulnerable sites and drive the transition from healthy to pathological states. This scenario becomes even more plausible when considering possible complex interplay between different types of somatic mutation events. For example, a somatic retrotransposition event may be accompanied by a local genomic destabilization and consequent recombination if the newly inserted retroelement finds itself flanked by inverted homologous repeats ( Gilbert et al., 2002 24. Gilbert, N. ∙ Lutz-Prigge, S. ∙ Moran, J.V. Genomic deletions created upon LINE-1 retrotransposition Cell. 2002; 110 :315-325 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is of particular interest also for estimates of the rate of retrotransposition in the human genome because the insertion of a young retroelement followed by recombination may create complex rearrangements masking the structural hallmarks of canonical retrotransposition events, namely target site duplications and a poly(A) tail, possibly resulting in underestimation of germ-line and somatic retrotransposition rates.
The evolutionary reason why genomes carry so many repeat element sequences is still a matter of debate ( Brunet and Doolittle, 2015 10. Brunet, T.D.P. ∙ Doolittle, W.F. Multilevel selection theory and the evolutionary functions of transposable elements Genome Biol. Evol. 2015; 7 :2445-2457 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results support the possibility that the repertoire of repeat elements may increase organismal fitness ( Brunet and Doolittle, 2015 10. Brunet, T.D.P. ∙ Doolittle, W.F. Multilevel selection theory and the evolutionary functions of transposable elements Genome Biol. Evol. 2015; 7 :2445-2457 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) by increasing somatic diversity. It is conceivable that the diversified metabolism of liver or neural cells, for example, is beneficial, much as the genetic diversity of a microbial population can enhance its resilience ( Giraud et al., 2001 25. Giraud, A. ∙ Radman, M. ∙ Matic, I. ... The rise and fall of mutator bacteria Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4 :582-585 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The characterization of the somatic recombination of Alu and L1 elements in this study paves the way for future experiments that will explore the dynamics of somatic NAHR events and their impact on the structure and function of our genomes.
The detection of somatic NAHR in bulk tissues, although allowing to assay a larger number of genomes at once, can only average the rates of somatic NAHR in single cells. Differences in transcriptional activity and chromatin architecture from one cell type to another may correlate with different recombination activity, as suggested by our results in iPSCs and iNEUs. This drawback extends also to the disease context: several neurodegenerative disorders like PD and AD are characterized by cell-specific vulnerabilities, and our data showing disease-specific NAHR profiles in PD and AD samples will require a finer dissection of this complexity to understand whether somatic recombination in neurodegeneration is restricted to specific brain cell types. Furthermore, this study does not provide evidence for a causative role of somatic NAHR in AD or PD, and functional experiments are necessary to understand the meaning of disease-specific NAHR profiles. The comparison of tissue-specific NAHR profiles in capture-seq and long-reads WGS datasets has revealed a few disagreements between the two approaches and, although this may be due to technical differences between the two technologies, future experiments will be required to elucidate these discrepancies.

All materials used in this study are commercially available. This study did not generate new unique reagents.
The use of human samples in this study was approved by Riken Research Ethics Committee with permission number H23-16. All information related to the donors are listed in Table S1 .
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of male origins were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (HUBi001-A).
All post-mortem human samples were obtained from the Brain Bank for Ageing Research, part of Tokyo Metropolitan Hospital. Upon reception samples were stored at -80C until usage. For genomic DNA extraction from liver and kidney samples ∼200mg of frozen tissue were reduced to fine powder in a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and transferred to 10ml lysis buffer ( Laird et al., 1991 39. Laird, P.W. ∙ Zijderveld, A. ∙ Linders, K. ... Simplified mammalian DNA isolation procedure Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 :4293 Crossref Scopus (1346) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genomic DNA extraction was performed as described previously with minor modifications ( Maniatis et al., 1982 47. Maniatis, T. ∙ Fritsch, E.F. ∙ Sambrook, J. Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y, 1982 Google Scholar ). DNA pellets were resuspended in DNA rehydration solution (Promega) and after quantitation with Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) quality control of each sample was performed by loading 300ng of resuspended DNA on 1% agarose gel. Due to scarcity of available starting material 3 DNA samples were exhausted during processing and could not be replaced (kidney sample for control donor 4, kidney sample for Parkinson’s disease donor 6).
After sorting each nuclei pellet was added with 900ul of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10mM EDTA 0.5M pH 8, 50mM Tris HCl pH 8, 150mM NaCl) and thoroughly resuspended by pipetting until no clumps were visible. Samples were incubated at 65C for 20 minutes, after which RNAse A (Sigma, 10ug/ml) was added and the digestion was carried on for 1 hour. After adjusting the temperature to 55C Proteinase K (NEB, 100ug/ml) was added to each sample and digestion was continued for 3 hours. Samples were then let cool down at RT. An equal volume of Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 v/v, Sigma) was added to the tubes and after 20 seconds vortexing the samples were centrifuged at 13000g for 7 minutes. The supernatant was carefully transferred to a fresh tube and the DNA was precipitated by adding NaAc 0.3M (Sigma) and 2.5 volumes of EtOH (Wako). After overnight incubation the samples were centrifuged at 13000g, 4C for 30 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were washed 2x with EtOH 75%. After removal of residual EtOH droplets the pellets were air dried for 10 minutes and resuspended in DNA rehydration solution (Promega). After quantitation with Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) 300ng of DNA from each sample were loaded on 1% agarose gel for quality control. Due to scarcity of starting material one sample was exhausted during testing and processing and could not be replaced (Control donor 2, Parietal cortex NeuN+).
Differentiation of iPSC into human cortical interneurons was adapted from Liu et al ( Liu et al., 2013 42. Liu, Y. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Sauvey, C. ... Directed differentiation of forebrain GABA interneurons from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1670-1679 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ). On day 0, iPSCs (HUBi001-A, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using Accutase (Life Technologies) and seeded into ultra-low attachment 96-well plates at 9 x 103 cells per well in StemFit containing 10 μM Y-27632 (STEMCELL Technologies). Neuroepithelial induction of self-assembled embryoid bodies (EB) was initiated on day 7 by transferring single EBs into low-attachment 24-well plates containing 500 μl of neuronal induction medium (NIM) consisting of DMEM/F12 (Wako), 1X N2-supplement (GIBCO), 1X non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 20 μg/mL heparin (Sigma). On day 11, EBs were attached to mouse laminin (15 μg/mL, Sigma)-coated 6-well plates at approximately 30 EBs per well and maintained in NIM until day 14 when neuronal rosettes appeared. Patterning of neuroepithelial cells into medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) progenitors was initiated on day 14 by replacing old medium with NIM containing 1.5 μM Purmorphamine (Stemgent). On day 16, neuronal rosettes, formed by multiple layers of columnar epithelia, were dissociated by gently blowing off the colonies using a 1 ml pipette tip, transferred into T25 flasks and maintained in NIM containing 1X B-27 supplement w/o vitamin A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) until day 26. Differentiation into GABAergic cortical interneurons was initiated on day 26 by dissociation of MGE progenitors using 1X TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and plating MGE progenitors into Poly-L-ornithine (PLO, Sigma) and laminin (Sigma)-coated 12-well plates at 4.5 x 10 4 cells per well containing neuronal differentiation medium consisting of DMEM/F12 (Wako), 1X N2-supplement (GIBCO), 1X non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X B-27 supplement with vitamin A (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 ng/ml BDNF (GIBCO), 10 ng/ml GDNF (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 ng/ml IGF (PeproTech) and 1 μM cAMP (Sigma). Proliferation of cells was inhibited by supplementing the medium for the first 3 days with 0.2 μM Compound E (EMD Biosciences). Half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium every third day until day 50. Undifferentiated human iPSC used for comparison in capture-seq were maintained in StemFit (Ajinomoto Co., Inc) on iMatrix-511 (Funakoshi)-coated 6-well plates. At the time of collection iPSC and differentiated neurons pellets were washed with PBS and stored at -80C.
Construction and quality control of capture-seq libraries are described in Methods S1 All capture-seq libraries from post-mortem tissues were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq4000 platform by BGI Genomics and demultiplexed according to respective indexes.
For capture-seq libraries from iPSC and differentiated neurons, cell pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer (100mM Tris Hcl pH 8.5, 50mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 100mM NaCl) and genomic DNA was purified with Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). Samples were quantified with Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher) and capture-seq libraries were constructed as described in Methods S1 with no modifications. Libraries were sequenced at 600 cycles on Illumina Miseq using Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina).
PromethION libraries were prepared from a total of 1 microgram of intact genomic using the Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) following the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was done on the PromethION sequencer for 72 hours with the MinKNOW software, and the base calling of the FAST5 data from PromethION was performed with Guppy v4.0.11 and subsequently converted into FASTQ files.
For capture-seq libraries, overlapping paired reads (median across libraries ∼98%) were merged in longer contigs using FLASH ( Magoč and Salzberg, 2011 46. Magoč, T. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. FLASH: fast length adjustment of short reads to improve genome assemblies Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :2957-2963 Crossref Scopus (10552) PubMed Google Scholar ); non-overlapping reads were merged with respective FLASH-extended contigs to generate single FASTQ files. FASTQ files from PromethION were aligned directly. Alignment on GRCh38 was performed with LAST ( Kiełbasa et al., 2011 36. Kiełbasa, S.M. ∙ Wan, R. ∙ Sato, K. ... Adaptive seeds tame genomic sequence comparison Genome Res. 2011; 21 :487-493 Crossref Scopus (859) PubMed Google Scholar ) using standard parameters.
For all capture-seq libraries we calculated the enrichment efficiency for young Alu and L1 as a routine quality control prior sequencing. We diluted to 50pg/ul aliquots of the adapter-ligated, capture-ready libraries (“pond”) and the respective PCR-amplified libraries after capture. We run triplicate qPCR reactions (TB Green Premix Ex Taq II, Takara Inc.) using 100pg per reaction as input and we measure the Ct of each sample using primers specific for young Alu and young L1 (Alu-Forward: TCCTGCCTCAGCCTCCCAAG; Alu-Reverse: GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCC; L1HS-Forward: CGGTGATTTCTGCATTTCCATC; L1HS-Reverse: TTCCCAGGTGAGGCAATGCCT). For each sample, the enrichment efficiency is then is calculated as 2 ΔCt(Post-Pre) , where “Post” is the Ct value for the enriched capture libraries and “Pre” is the Ct of the respective pond. The differences between the capture efficiencies for L1HS and Alu can be explained by the respective genomic abundance of these two repeat element families. The human genome contains ∼1.2 million Alu copies, but only a few hundred full-length L1HS sequences; therefore, the probability that any genomic fragment in the pre-capture libraries may carry a sequence recognized by the qPCR primers is higher for Alu than for L1HS. This means that the ΔCt between the pre- and post-capture libraries is invariably lower for Alu than for L1HS, resulting in higher enrichment efficiency for L1HS.
To calculate the capture efficiency for all Alu and L1 subfamilies in the mapped capture-seq libraries, we extracted from all mapped capture-seq libraries reads with a low mismap score (P < 10e-4), converted the reads to BED format, intersected the genomic coordinates of the reads with the genomic coordinates of subfamilies Alu and L1 elements annotated in RepeatMasker ( Table S3 ) and finally calculated the relative proportion of captured elements for each capture-seq library.
Finding DNA sequence rearrangements involving repeat elements, especially homologous recombination, by comparing DNA reads to a reference genome requires accurate probability-based reads-to-genome alignment. We first determined the rates (probabilities) of substitutions, deletions, and insertions between reads and genome using last-train ( Hamada et al., 2017 28. Hamada, M. ∙ Ono, Y. ∙ Asai, K. ... Training alignment parameters for arbitrary sequencers with LAST-TRAIN Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :926-928 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to find genome sequence rearrangements involving repeats, TE-reX needs three input files: 1) Alignments of DNA reads to the genome; 2) Alignments of the genome to repeat consensus sequences; 3) Alignments between pairs of repeat consensus sequences. The read-to-genome alignments are made with last-split ( Frith and Kawaguchi, 2015 22. Frith, M.C. ∙ Kawaguchi, R. Split-alignment of genomes finds orthologies more accurately Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :106 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), so each read base is aligned to at most one genome base. Each read has one or more alignments, e.g. the read in Data S3 vB has two alignments (shown in red). The genome-to-repeat alignments are made with last-split as well, so each genome base-pair is aligned to at most one base-pair in the repeat database. The repeat-to-repeat alignments retain at most one highest-scoring alignment between any pair of repeats. To identify the rearrangements, for each read we checked whether any pair of alignments that occur consecutively in the read indicate homologous recombination following these steps: • Require at least one alignment of the pair to have error probability (mismap score) P < 10e-4. • Require <= ∗ slop ∗ unaligned read bases between the two alignments. ∗ slop ∗ is a parameter with default value 4, however for maximum stringency all TE-reX datasets in this work have been produced with slop set to 0. • Call the end of the 1st alignment endX, and the beginning of the 2nd alignment begY. • Require endX to lie within a genomic segment that is aligned to a repeat (call it repeatX); likewise require begY to lie within some repeatY. • Require that repeatX and repeatY are of types that have an alignment in the repeat-to-repeat alignments. • Based on the repeat-to-repeat alignments, find endXh = the homologous coordinate in repeatY of endX, and begYh = the homologous coordinate in repeatX of begY. Require that at least one of (endXh, begY) and (endX, begYh) differ by <= ∗ slop ∗ . • If repeatX and repeatY are of the same type (same repeat consensus sequence), check whether the alignments could be explained by reference-specific deletion. For example: if the read comes from repeatX only, and part of repeatX is deleted in the reference genome (but not in the read), that part of the read may get wrongly aligned to a paralog, in a way that looks just like homologous recombination. Reference-specific deletion is considered possible if the remaining genomic length of repeatX after endX is less than the genomic length of repeatY that is aligned to the read (or likewise with X and Y swapped).
TE-reX output files are in.maf format and in order to annotate and analyze recombination events genome-wide we first processed the.maf files using custom scripts to perform the following operations: a) convert 4-lined.maf files in 1-lined BED-like format; b) collapse PCR duplicates into single entries; c) generate a unique identifier for each recombination event, by joining the modified RepeatMasker annotations of each pair of recombined repeats and the breakpoint junction information from TE-reX; d) select for recombination events having both split reads with mismap score = P < 10e-4; e) calculate the genomic distance of the recombined repeat pairs (<100 kb, >100 kb, inter-chromosomal); f) annotate the type of rearrangement: inter-chromosomal, intra-chromosomal inversion (the two recombined elements are on opposite strands), intra-chromosomal duplication and intra-chromosomal deletion for direct repeat pairs. For the last two rearrangement types, the classification was obtained by comparing the order of the recombined repeat elements in each sequenced read with the original genomic order. If the recombined repeats generated a deletion, the order of the two repeats in a sequenced recombination event is unchanged compared to the order in the genome (5’-repeatA-repeatB-3’). If the order of the sequenced repeats is inverted compared to the genomic annotation (5’-repeatA-repeatB-3’ in GRCh38, 5’-repeatB-repeatA-3’ in the sequenced reads), this indicates a NAHR causing a genomic duplication.
In order to perform inter-library and inter-dataset comparisons of NAHR events counts in capture-seq datasets we subsampled the FASTQ files of all capture-seq libraries according to the library with the lowest FASTQ reads count (∼8.3 million FASTQ reads, Table S2 ), re-aligned the subsampled files and run again TE-reX on the subsampled mapped libraries.
To estimate the number of NAHR events per cell in each library, we first calculated the theoretical number of cells used to construct each library based on the amount of input processed DNA. The pre-capture input DNA for each library consisted of fragmented genomic DNA (∼220bp), adapters and sequencing linkers (119bp). Hence, each pre-capture library construct contained ∼65% of genomic DNA sequence and ∼35% of accessory DNA sequences. For Alu and L1 capture libraries we used respectively 100ng and 300ng of input processed DNA, we calculated a total amount of genomic DNA used as a pool for capture of 65ng and 195ng for Alu and L1 libraries, respectively. Considering that a single diploid nucleus contains ∼6pg of genomic DNA, the amount of genomic DNA used as input for Alu and L1 capture in each library corresponded to a theoretical individual cells number of respectively ∼10833 and ∼32500. The values plotted in Figures 1 H, 1I, and 5 A and in Data S2 were obtained by normalizing the count of putative somatic NAHR in the subsampled capture-seq libraries by the theoretical estimate of individual cells used per library.
Putative somatic and putative polymorphic/germline NAHR datasets were isolated by merging NAHR events annotated in all capture-seq libraries, and by collapsing the unique identifiers. Recombination events with unique identifiers found only in a single library were flagged as putative somatic. For the definition of putative polymorphic/germline NAHR events, we considered unlikely for a somatic recombination event to involve the same 2 repeat elements using the same breakpoint junction. However, we cannot completely exclude that this may happen in some instances, given that the junctions of putative somatic NAHR events present some positional bias (e.g. Figure 2 I). By definition, polymorphic/germline NAHR events should be detected in all 8 libraries available for each donor (kidney, liver, frontal cortex NeuN-, frontal cortex NeuN+, temporal cortex NeuN-, temporal cortex NeuN+, parietal cortex NeuN-, parietal cortex NeuN+). However, accounting for potential detection/sensitivity bias due to the short reads we decided to relax this criterion and we preventively flagged as putative polymorphic all the NAHR events with the same unique identifier found in 2+ capture-seq libraries.
The analysis of overlap of genomic location and theoretical genomic size of putative somatic and polymorphic NAHR events with SVs in the DGV has a few caveats, namely: 1) SVs featured in the DGV derive from studies using different sequencing technologies, hence the breakpoints of the SVs may lack consistency and to compensate for this issue we allowed a ±10% genomic size discrepancy between capture-seq NAHRs and DGV SVs; 2) there is no explicit indication of NAHR events in the DGV metadata, although at least one included study discriminates between insertions and deletions caused by repeat elements ( Audano et al., 2019 4. Audano, P.A. ∙ Sulovari, A. ∙ Graves-Lindsay, T.A. ... Characterizing the major structural variant alleles of the human genome Cell. 2019; 176 :663.e19 675.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) Google Scholar ); 3) the comparison can be performed only for intra-chromosomal NAHR events, since the database does not include inter-chromosomal SVs.
For the PCR validation we selected recombination events for which we could identify non-repeat flanking genomic regions at both 5’- and 3-ends of each contig encompassing one single recombination event. The primers were manually designed using Primer3 ( Untergasser et al., 2012 69. Untergasser, A. ∙ Cutcutache, I. ∙ Koressaar, T. ... Primer3—new capabilities and interfaces Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :e115 Crossref Scopus (6752) PubMed Google Scholar ); all sequences annealed on unique genomic regions, thus suppressing cross-amplification of non-specific sequences. PCR reactions were performed with Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB) in 25ul using 25ng of input (capture-seq library or genomic DNA) and 10uM of forward/reverse primers. Amplification was carried out with initial 10 cycles of touchdown PCR (1x initial denaturation 98C for 30s, 10x 98C for 10s, primers-specific Tm +10C for 30s decreasing by 1C each cycle, 72C for 7s) followed by 30 cycles of standard PCR (98C for 10s, primers-specific Tm for 30s, 72C for 7s, final elongation 72C for 120s). PCR products were cleaned with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified with Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA assay (Thermo Fisher). 20ng of each PCR products were transferred in 96-wells plates, mixed with 5uM forward primers and submitted for Sanger sequencing (Genewiz). Where needed, nested PCR was performed with LongAmp Hot Start Taq 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) following manufacturer’s protocol. The first PCR was carried out in 25ul volume using 20ng input DNA; amplification included initial 10 cycles of touchdown PCR (1x initial denaturation 94C for 30s, 10x 94C for 30s, primers-specific Tm +10C for 30s decreasing by 1C each cycle, 65C for 20s) followed by 10 cycles of standard PCR (94C for 10s, primers-specific Tm for 30s, 65C for 20s, final extension 65C for 10 minutes). The nested PCR used 2ul of input from the first PCR and was performed for additional 35 cycles (94C for 10s, primers-specific Tm for 30s, 65C for 20s, final extension 65C for 10 minutes).
Enrichment, or depletion, of Alu and L1 NAHR events in gene and regulatory regions (i.e. genomic features) were assessed by random permutation of their breakpoints. These genomic features include 1) the exonic coding sequence (CDS), 3’ untranslated region (UTR), 5’UTR, intron and transcription start sites of coding transcripts from GENCODE v34, and 2) regulatory regions (i.e. enhancer and promoter) from Roadmap Epigenomics consortium (38), either from individual samples (n=111) or all samples pooled ( Data S3 ). A set of control regions, generated by randomly sampling of 1 kb windows (n=1,000,000) from the masked genome, was used to normalize potential bias in the permutation procedure (described below). The masked genome is referred to as chromosome 1 to 22 and X in GRCh38, subtracted with gap regions defined in UCSC genome browser. Breakpoints (n=2 per NAHR event) of the same tissue fraction from multiple donors of the same disease/control group were pooled and permuted (i.e. shuffled, using BEDTools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 54. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15098) PubMed Google Scholar ) shuffle ) into their corresponding TE elements (i.e. AluY/S/J and L1HS/PAx) in the masked genome for 100 times. Only the TE elements with at least 1 observed breakpoint in all datasets were included in the shuffling scope. The number of observed and expected (i.e. permuted) breakpoints within each set of genomic features, and the control regions, was counted. The observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio of each set of genomic features, is defined as the ratio of the observed to expected breakpoints within the genomic feature, normalized by that of the control region. The permutation procedure was repeated with each set of the genomic feature regions (i.e. actual regions, solid dots in Data S3i–iv ) randomly shuffled within the whole genome (i.e. random regions, hollow circles in Data S3i–iv ). A Student’s t-test was used to compare the O/E ratio of the actual region to the random region. We consider the NAHR events are significantly enriched, or depleted, in a set of genomic features when P < 0.05 and O/E ratio is >1.1 or <1/(1.1).
Lists of AD- (MONDO_0004975) and PD- (MONDO_0005180) associated genes and their association scores were obtained from Open Targets Platform ( https://platform.opentargets.org/ ). Genes with symbols that do not match to that in GENCODEv38 were removed and the top 300 genes with highest association scores were taken as genes associated with each disease. Then, we intersected the NAHR event breakpoints with the gene body of these disease-associated genes (based on GENCODEv38) and defined disease-associated breakpoints. To test for the enrichment of AD-/PD-associated breakpoints in breakpoints observed in certain samples, we performed Fisher’s exact test on 2x2 contingency tables with breakpoint frequency counts on two variables: disease (associated with the disease or not) and sample (observed in the sample or not), with the breakpoints observed in all samples in this study as the scope. The tests were performed for individual sample or pooled samples within the same tissue of the same disease group. These tests were performed separately for each type of NAHR events, i.e. inter-chromosomal, intra-chromosomal inversion, deletion and duplication events. Intra-chromosomal events were further partitioned by distance between breakpoints, i.e. large (>100 kb) or otherwise small events. For the tests for pooled samples in each NAHR event type, the threshold of significance was set at p-value < 0.002 (Bonferroni's adjustment for multiple tests, 0.05/(3 disease groups × 8 tissues) = 0.002). For comparing the differences between individual samples from different disease groups, Student’s t-tests were performed on the –log(p-value) from the Fisher’s exact tests of the individual samples.
To investigate the differences of NAHR event breakpoints in AD-/PD-associated genes between control and disease donors, we counted the NAHR event breakpoints within the gene body of all genes in GENCODEv38 for each donor, with different combinations of NAHR event classes (i.e. intra-, inter-chromosomal and all events) and tissues (i.e. kidney, liver, all fractions of frontal, temporal and parietal cortex) as the scopes. Within each scope, genes will total breakpoint counts less than 10 were removed. Within each scope, the breakpoint count for each gene were normalized as number of breakpoints per million breakpoints observed in all genes (bpm) within each donor. A value of 1 bpm was added to all genes to avoid zeros. Only AD-/PD-associated genes (n=300 for each disease) were retained for downstream analyses. The fold-change of bpm between AD- or PD-donors and control donors were calculated (as ratio of mean in each group) and only the genes with positive fold-change (i.e. higher bpm in the disease group) were retained. Student’s t-tests were performed to test for the significance of the difference of bpm for each gene between the disease and control group. P-values within each scope were corrected as false discovery rate.
All analyses were performed using a combination of BEDtools and custom bash scripts. For the analysis of intra-chromosomal recombination rates the real data was compared against the genomic distribution of 100 random dataset generated in silico by shuffling RepeatMasker annotations of Alu and L1 elements included in the analysis and sized to match the real data. For the comparison of intra-chromosomal recombination rates in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) datasets vs the control dataset in Figures 5 C and 5D, we first divided the rate of intra-chromosomal recombination of each chromosome for each tissue in PD and AD datasets (average of 10 donors) by the respective values in the control dataset, then we calculated and plotted the Log 2 of the ratios.
To identification recombination hotspots we used a permutation strategy to assess whether the observed number of breakpoint within a TE is higher than its expected distribution. The permutation were performed separately for each sample group (i.e. Healthy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's samples) and each TE subfamily (i.e. 3 Alu and 17 L1 subfamilies). Briefly, the observed breakpoints from all tissues within a sample group and a TE subfamily were pooled and redundant breakpoints were merged. These non-redundant breakpoints were randomly redistributed (i.e. permutation, n=100 rounds) within the elements of the corresponding TE subfamily using BEDTools shuffle [20110278]. For each TE, a z-score was calculated by comparing its observed number of breakpoints to its expected distribution from permutations (i.e. null distribution). This z-score can thus be interpreted as a measure of recombination frequency, relative to the null distribution and normalized by the size of an individual element and the number of elements within a subfamily. An element with z-score >1.645 was interpreted as significantly more frequently recombined (p<0.05, one-tailed) than the background and was defined as an "hot" element.
To identify genomic loci with high recombination activity, we first divided the genome in 100 kb bins using BEDTools makewindows . For each bin we calculated the total number of Alu and L1 annotated in the Repeatmasker and the total number of NAHR events in TE-reX datasets. We then divided the number of repeats annotated in a given bin the total count of NAHR per bin. The normalized NAHR values per bin for chr21 were used for the plot in Figure 3 A, using the R package chromoMap ( Anand and Rodriguez Lopez, 2022 2. Anand, L. ∙ Rodriguez Lopez, C.M. ChromoMap: an R package for interactive visualization of multi-omics data and annotation of chromosomes BMC Bioinformatics. 2022; 23 :33 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). The same normalized NAHR values for each respective dataset were ranked and plotted to obtain the plots in Figures 3 B, 3C, 6 I, and 6J and in Data S2 .
Coordinates for human centromeres were obtained from the UCSC Table Browser, they were extended by ±1Mb with BEDTools slop to include peri-centromeric regions and then the extended coordinates were intersected using BEDTools intersect with GRCh38 100 kb genomic bins in order to annotate the bins proximal to centromeres. Next, for each capture-seq library we counted using BEDTools intersect the number of NAHR events in which both repeats, only one repeat or no repeats were contained within a centromeric genomic bin (“observed”). The expected values were calculated by generating 1000 datasets of randomly paired repeat elements to simulate random NAHR events, and similarly counting simulated events having both repeats, only one repeat or no repeats contained within a centromeric genomic bin (“expected”). Finally, for each sample we calculated and plotted the ratio between “observed” and “expected”.
For the analysis of enrichment of recombination hotspots in COSMIC cancer genes we first obtained the COSMIC Cancer Genes Census from the COSMIC website ( https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download ) and modified it in BED-like format. We then intersected with BEDTools intersect the RepeatMasker database with the COSMIC genes coordinates in order to obtain a list of all Alu and L1HS/PA annotated within COSMIC cancer genes (for Alu: n=36354; for L1HS/PA: n=2134). Next we aggregated the list of 8 capture-seq libraries for each single donor and obtained the list of Alu and L1 elements with z-score≥2 in each aggregated donor dataset. For each donor we then calculated the percentage of hot repeat elements mapped within COSMIC genes using BEDTools intersect . To understand how these values compared to non-cancer genes, the percentages of hot elements in COSMIC genes for each donor were compared with 100 random datasets obtained in the following way. We first compiled a list of Alu and L1HS/PA in non-cancer genes by subtracting the COSMIC cancer genes set from all Refseq genes using BEDTools subtract and subsequently intersecting this non-cancer genes list with the RepeatMasker Alu and L1HS/PA annotations, again with BEDTools intersect . From this list we then generated 100 random datasets, sized as the number of Alu and L1 in COSMIC genes listed above (n=36354 and n=2134). For each tissue of each donor we next calculated the percentage of hot Alu and L1 elements int each random dataset with BEDTools intersect and these values were used for the plots in Figures 3 F–3I and in Data S2 .
For the analysis of recombination in A and B compartments in human iPSC and differentiated neurons, we first obtained the genomic coordinates of A and B compartments from Lu et al.( Lu et al., 2020 44. Lu, L. ∙ Liu, X. ∙ Huang, W.K. ... Robust Hi-C maps of enhancer-promoter interactions reveal the function of non-coding genome in neural development and diseases Mol. Cell. 2020; 79 :521-534.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) and converted them from GRCh37 to GRCh38 using UCSC LiftOver program ( https://genome-store.ucsc.edu/ ). We next intersected with BEDTools intersect the compartments coordinates in human iPSC and neurons from Lu et al., in order to obtain a set of compartments that stay constant during the differentiation process as to avoid potential confounding effect from different proportions of A and B compartments in the two cell types. Next, using BEDTools intersect we intersected the genomic coordinates of NAHR events in capture-seq datasets of iPSC and differentiated neurons with the modified set of A/B compartments described above and calculated all combinations the relative abundance of NAHR events in each compartment.
All details about the statistical analyses used in this study are described in the methods and in the Figure legends. Mann–Whitney U test was performed in R. Student’s T-test (in all analyses: unpaired, two-tailed) and One-Way ANOVA test were performed in Excel or R. Significance of each figure panel is detailed in the respective figure legends. Randomized datasets were generated from the real datasets with varying number of iterations tailored for each specific testing and always comparably sized according to real dataset to avoid any potential bias.
