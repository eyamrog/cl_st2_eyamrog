Title: FAMIN Is a Multifunctional Purine Enzyme Enabling the Purine Nucleotide Cycle


Abstract: Summary

Mutations in FAMIN cause arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease in early childhood, and a common genetic variant increases the risk for Crohn's disease and leprosy. We developed an unbiased liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry screen for enzymatic activity of this orphan protein. We report that FAMIN phosphorolytically cleaves adenosine into adenine and ribose-1-phosphate. Such activity was considered absent from eukaryotic metabolism. FAMIN and its prokaryotic orthologs additionally have adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and S -methyl-5′-thioadenosine phosphorylase activity, hence, combine activities of the namesake enzymes of central purine metabolism. FAMIN enables in macrophages a purine nucleotide cycle (PNC) between adenosine and inosine monophosphate and adenylosuccinate, which consumes aspartate and releases fumarate in a manner involving fatty acid oxidation and ATP-citrate lyase activity. This macrophage PNC synchronizes mitochondrial activity with glycolysis by balancing electron transfer to mitochondria, thereby supporting glycolytic activity and promoting oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial H + and phosphate recycling.

Section: Introduction

FAMIN (Fatty Acid Metabolism-Immunity Nexus; LACC1 , C13orf31) is strongly linked to human disease ( Table S1 ). Highly penetrant mutations, such as C284R, cause juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Still's disease (a fever with rash followed by arthritis), or early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A common coding polymorphism (I254V) increases risk for Crohn's disease (CD; an IBD) and leprosy, an infection with Mycobacterium leprae .
Mice with germline deletion ( Famin –/– ) or engineered to express human non-risk, risk, and monogenic disease FAMIN variants ( Famin p.254I , Famin p.254V , and Famin p.284R , respectively) revealed that reduced or absent FAMIN activity increases the severity of experimental sepsis and arthritis ( Cader et al., 2016; Skon-Hegg et al., 2019 12.

Mitochondrial and NOX2-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, bacterial killing, NOD2- and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent signaling, inflammasome activation, and cytokine secretion are compromised with impaired FAMIN and linked to perturbed mitochondrial function ( Cader et al., 2016; Lahiri et al., 2017 12.

Commun. 2017; 8 :15614 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis are compromised and total cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reduced in Famin mutant macrophages. Impaired FAMIN compromises both classically activated “M1” macrophages and alternatively activated “M2” macrophages ( Cader et al., 2016; O’Neill and Pearce, 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar 53. O’Neill, L.A. ∙ Pearce, E.J. Immunometabolism governs dendritic cell and macrophage function J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :15-23 Crossref Scopus (1119) PubMed Google Scholar ). FAMIN tethers to the cytosolic surface of peroxisomes in a complex with fatty acid synthase (FASN) ( Assadi et al., 2016; Cader et al., 2016; Hillebrand et al., 2012 7.

Chem. 2012; 287 :210-221 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). The flux of glucose carbon into fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is curtailed in Famin mutant macrophages ( Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). How FAMIN, which shares homology with bacterial orthologs (Pfam motif Domain of Unknown Function [DUF] 152), exerts such profound immunometabolic control had remained enigmatic.
Here, we report an unbiased metabolomic screen for enzyme activity that unearthed FAMIN as a conserved multi-functional purine nucleoside metabolizing enzyme with activities that challenge fundamental principles of purine metabolism.

Section: Results

Identifying biochemical functions of orphan proteins is a formidable challenge ( Prosser et al., 2014 59. Prosser, G.A. ∙ Larrouy-Maumus, G. ∙ de Carvalho, L.P. Metabolomic strategies for the identification of new enzyme functions and metabolic pathways EMBO Rep. 2014; 15 :657-669 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). We devised an unbiased screen for enzyme activity against an extensive library of metabolites without a priori assumptions on putative function. From transiently transfected HEK293T cells, we purified chromatographically monomeric recombinant human FAMIN (referred to as “FAMIN 254I ” for the fully active variant), which exhibited stable properties in solution consistent with correct folding and lack of aggregation ( Figures S1 A–S1C). We generated a metabolite library from the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 transfected with FAMIN small interfering RNA (siRNA), which proliferated less and exhibited reduced glycolysis and OXPHOS ( Figures S1 D and S1E). Hence, FAMIN performed a non-redundant role, letting us expect that extracts would contain all cofactors and substrates required for its activity.
We adopted quantitative, high-sensitivity and high-resolution orthogonal liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to resolve a wide range of highly diverse metabolites. We identified >25,000 unique quantifiable LC-MS features in freeze-dried aqueous extracts of FAMIN -silenced HepG2 cells across chromatography modalities and ionization modes ( Figure 1 A). We incubated 10 μg recombinant human FAMIN 254I or an equivalent volume of protein buffer, with the metabolite library resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37°C. Samples were then re-extracted and analyzed. Within this vast library, 3 LC-MS features significantly decreased and 4 increased in abundance in the FAMIN 254I compared to the mock reaction ( Figures 1 B and 1C).
The m/z values of the 3 LC-MS features with reduced abundance (a–c in Figures 1 B and 1C) matched exactly those of purine nucleosides. Molecular formula determination, using accurate mass and supported by isotopic mass distribution, also indicated compounds a–c were purine nucleosides. Molecular formula and m/z could not unambiguously discriminate their identity. Comparing chromatography characteristics of a–c against authentic standards demonstrated that the retention times exactly matched adenosine, inosine, and guanosine ( Figures 1 D, 1E, S1 F, and S1G), suggesting FAMIN catabolizes the major cellular purine nucleosides. Consistent with this, the m/z values of LC-MS features d–f ( Figures 1 B and 1C), whose levels increased in the presence of FAMIN 254I , matched hypoxanthine, guanine, and a pentose-phosphate, respectively ( Figures 1 E and S1 G). LC-MS feature g corresponded to xanthine, although levels were extremely low. Modified chromatography unambiguously separated isomeric pentose-phosphates and identified feature f as ribose-1-phosphate (R1P; Figure S1 H). Recombinant FAMIN 254I did not affect any other nucleosides or nucleotides also present in our library ( Figure S1 I). Adenosine, inosine, and guanosine consumption increased with the amount of recombinant FAMIN 254I in the reaction ( Figures 1 F and S1 I). This suggested FAMIN may be an enzyme acting on purine nucleosides to generate nucleobases and R1P.
To unambiguously validate results from the library screen, we examined enzyme activity in a fully reductionist system using pure substrate. FAMIN 254I consumed adenosine and generated inosine, hypoxanthine, and R1P, which was confirmed by authentic standards ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S1 J). No spontaneous degradation of adenosine or formation of products occurred in the absence of FAMIN 254I or adenosine ( Figures 2 A and 2B), nor with an unrelated enzyme, cholesterol oxidase ( Figure S2 A). Because our LC methods did not resolve adenosine and adenine well and because adenosine can undergo source fragmentation to adenine, we applied further chromatography methods to separate them. This demonstrated that FAMIN 254I converted adenosine to adenine ( Figure 2 C), whereby ∼85% of consumed adenosine yielded adenine and ∼15% inosine ( Figure 2 D). FAMIN-catalyzed activities were further confirmed by tracing [ 15 N 5 13 C 10 ] adenosine-derived stable isotopes into reaction products ( Table S2 ). Incubating FAMIN 254I with adenine and R1P yielded adenosine, demonstrating the reverse reaction ( Figure 2 E) and corroborating identities of the products of the forward reaction. No other adenosine products were detected, and heat-denaturing inactivated FAMIN 254I ( Figure S2 B). Consistent with orthophosphate (P i ) required for phosphorolysis, the reaction progressed only to inosine when performed in non-phosphate buffer ( Figure S2 B). Hence, FAMIN exhibited activities as adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and reactions proceeded independently from each other ( Figure 2 F).
FAMIN 254I also metabolized pure inosine and guanosine into R1P and their respective nucleobases hypoxanthine and guanine ( Figures 2 G, 2H, S2 C, and S2D), whereas no activity toward cytidine was detected ( Figure 2 G). FAMIN 254I also metabolized 2′-deoxy-adenosine, producing adenine, 2′-deoxy-inosine, hypoxanthine, and 2′-deoxy-R1P ( Figures 2 G and S2 E–S2I). 5′-Deoxy-adenosine, a by-product of radical S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes ( Landgraf et al., 2016 40. Landgraf, B.J. ∙ McCarthy, E.L. ∙ Booker, S.J. Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes in Human Health and Disease Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2016; 85 :485-514 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ), was also a substrate of FAMIN 254I ( Figure S2 J and S2K). FAMIN 254I further metabolized S- methyl-5′-thioadenosine (MTA) into adenine and S -methyl-5′-thioribose-1-phosphate ( Figures 2 H and 2I), while not affecting SAM ( Figure 2 G). Revisiting the library screen, we noticed a 50% reduction of MTA with 100 μg FAMIN 254I ( Figure S2 L). This added a third activity of FAMIN as a MTA phosphorylase ( Figure 2 J).
Orthologs containing the C-terminal portion of FAMIN are widely distributed across prokaryotes but are confined to metazoans in eukaryotes ( Figure S2 M). An Escherichia coli -expressed, maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein of truncated FAMIN containing the DUF152 homology domain only (FAMIN Δ176 ) exhibited all three enzymatic activities, similar to MBP-tagged full-length FAMIN ( Figure S2 N). Consistent with DUF152 containing all enzymatic activity, recombinantly expressed DUF152 bacterial proteins YlmD and YfiH metabolized adenosine to inosine and adenine, MTA to adenine, and inosine to hypoxanthine ( Figure 3 A). Crystal structures of several bacterial DUF152 proteins have been determined and revealed a monomeric α/β/α fold ( Kim et al., 2006 35. Kim, Y. ∙ Maltseva, N. ∙ Dementieva, I. ... Crystal structure of hypothetical protein YfiH from Shigella flexneri at 2 A resolution Proteins. 2006; 63 :1097-1101 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify the binding pocket, we soaked YlmD crystals with inosine. Inosine-soaked crystals diffracted to 1.2-Å resolution and contained additional electron density not present in native YlmD crystals, unambiguously identifying the purine ring of a bound inosine molecule ( Figure 3 B; Table S3 ). The structure contained weaker additional density of a partially hydrolyzed or disordered ribose moiety ( Figures 3 C–3E). The hypoxanthine moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg 59 . The ribose moiety is coordinated by the side chains of Cys 125 , His 80 , and His 142 , a triad conserved in YfiH and previously predicted as active site ( Kim et al., 2006 35. Kim, Y. ∙ Maltseva, N. ∙ Dementieva, I. ... Crystal structure of hypothetical protein YfiH from Shigella flexneri at 2 A resolution Proteins. 2006; 63 :1097-1101 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to inosine-bound YlmD, in an apo-YlmD crystal that diffracted to 1.2 Å, the His 47 side chain was found inserted into the purine-binding pocket ( Figure 3 C), consistent with a previously deposited apo structure (protein data bank [PDB]: 1T8H). The His 47 side chain may act as a gatekeeper of the active site that rotates outward when the substrate binds. FAMIN has several aromatic residues in the corresponding loop that could function analogously to His 47 . Atypical laccase activity has been ascribed to some bacterial DUF152 proteins based on a spectrophotometric method that monitors the oxidation of proxy substrates ( Beloqui et al., 2006 8. Beloqui, A. ∙ Pita, M. ∙ Polaina, J. ... Novel polyphenol oxidase mined from a metagenome expression library of bovine rumen: biochemical properties, structural analysis, and phylogenetic relationships J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :22933-22942 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this method, YlmD, YfiH, and FAMIN 254I , in contrast to a conventional laccase, elicited only minuscule signals ( Figure S3 A). In a sensitive LC-MS method ( Perna et al., 2018 58. Perna, V. ∙ Agger, J.W. ∙ Holck, J. ... Multiple Reaction Monitoring for quantitative laccase kinetics by LC-MS Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :8114 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), laccase end-products were only detected with a conventional laccase but not with YlmD, YfiH, or FAMIN 254I ( Figure 3 F). We conclude that FAMIN is a prototype of a new, evolutionarily conserved family of multifunctional purine-nucleoside-metabolizing enzymes.
Eukaryotic cells have been considered devoid of an enzyme that phosphorolytically converts adenosine to adenine ( Friedkin and Kalckar, 1961; Maynes et al., 1999; Zimmerman et al., 1971 25.

FAMIN adds such adenosine phosphorylase activity to mammalian metabolism and combines within one single enzyme three essential, non-redundant activities that supply purine nucleotide salvage. These latter activities had been thought to be due to single, ubiquitously expressed genes: adenosine deaminase ( ADA ; secreted ADA2 is expressed from a separate gene), purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ), and S -methyl-5′-thioadenosine phosphorylase ( MTAP ) ( Ashihara et al., 2018; Murray, 1971 6.

The biological significance of purine salvage Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1971; 40 :811-826 Crossref Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ). Loss of ADA or PNP activity causes severe combined immunodeficiency ( Giblett et al., 1972, 1975 26. Giblett, E.R. ∙ Anderson, J.E. ∙ Cohen, F. ... Adenosine-deaminase deficiency in two patients with severely impaired cellular immunity Lancet. 1972; 2 :1067-1069 Abstract Scopus (1198) PubMed Google Scholar 27.

Nucleoside-phosphorylase deficiency in a child with severely defective T-cell immunity and normal B-cell immunity Lancet. 1975; 1 :1010-1013 Abstract Scopus (639) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas MTAP is frequently deleted in cancers ( Kryukov et al., 2016 38. Kryukov, G.V. ∙ Wilson, F.H. ∙ Ruth, J.R. ... MTAP deletion confers enhanced dependency on the PRMT5 arginine methyltransferase in cancer cells Science. 2016; 351 :1214-1218 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). ADA, PNP, and MTAP activities are critically important because adenosine, inosine, and guanosine and their nucleobases adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine are neither precursors nor intermediates of de novo purine synthesis but are generated by the reactions that supply purine nucleotide salvage; salvage then proceeds by hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) ( Camici et al., 2018 13. Camici, M. ∙ Allegrini, S. ∙ Tozzi, M.G. Interplay between adenylate metabolizing enzymes and AMP-activated protein kinase FEBS J. 2018; 285 :3337-3352 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ).
FAMIN’s apparent K m s for its main substrates were similar to those reported for ADA, PNP, and MTAP ( Figure 3 G; Table S4 ; Bzowska et al., 2000; Della Ragione et al., 1996; Lindley and Pisoni, 1993 11. Bzowska, A. ∙ Kulikowska, E. ∙ Shugar, D. Purine nucleoside phosphorylases: properties, functions, and clinical aspects Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 88 :349-425 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar 19. Della Ragione, F. ∙ Takabayashi, K. ∙ Mastropietro, S. ... Purification and characterization of recombinant human 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase: definite identification of coding cDNA Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223 :514-519 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Lindley, E.R. ∙ Pisoni, R.L. Demonstration of adenosine deaminase activity in human fibroblast lysosomes Biochem. J. 1993; 290 :457-462 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the corresponding V max s were low ( Table S4 ). We next addressed how I254V affected activity. Adenosine consumption was approximately halved with FAMIN 254V compared to FAMIN 254I ( Figure 3 H), with conversion to adenine and R1P 10-fold lower ( Figure 3 I), mirrored in the reverse reaction ( Figure S3 B). In contrast, the production of inosine and hypoxanthine by FAMIN 254V was slightly higher and similar, respectively, compared to FAMIN 254I ( Figures 3 I and S3 C). Thus, FAMIN 254V converted only ∼20%, rather than FAMIN 254I ’s 85%, of consumed adenosine to adenine, instead diverting it to inosine and thence hypoxanthine ( Figure 3 J). Phosphorolysis activities toward inosine and MTA were also lower in FAMIN 254V than in FAMIN 254I ( Figures S3 D and S3E). Hence, FAMIN 254I and FAMIN 254V activities differed quantitatively and qualitatively, favoring adenosine phosphorolysis and adenosine deamination, respectively.
To address whether FAMIN affected cellular purine levels, we transiently transfected FAMIN expression vectors into HEK293T cells. FAMIN 254I and FAMIN 254V proteins express equally high, and FAMIN 284R expression is negligible ( Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hypoxanthine, guanine, and inosine monophosphate (IMP) levels were higher 24 h after transfecting FAMIN 254I than in controls ( Figure 3 K). The doubling in levels of IMP, the obligatory intermediate of purine salvage and de novo synthesis ( Camici et al., 2018 13. Camici, M. ∙ Allegrini, S. ∙ Tozzi, M.G. Interplay between adenylate metabolizing enzymes and AMP-activated protein kinase FEBS J. 2018; 285 :3337-3352 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), extended to FAMIN 254V transfectants, whereas the increase in hypoxanthine was moderate compared to FAMIN 254I ( Figure 3 K). Other purine nucleosides were not affected ( Table S5 ). Conversely, IMP levels halved in HepG2 cells 24 h after transfecting FAMIN siRNA ( Figure 4 A), which, compared to control siRNA, boosted inosine, guanosine, and MTA and reduced hypoxanthine levels ( Figures 4 B and S3 F). Hence, FAMIN impacted on the levels of central purines despite preserved ADA, PNP, and MTAP expression ( Figure S3 G), prompting us to compare proliferation and energy metabolism upon their knockdown. Although MTAP siRNA reduced proliferation ( Figure S3 H) and basal respiration similar to FAMIN siRNA, MTAP -silenced cells did not exhibit the steep decline in respiration of FAMIN -silenced HepG2 cells after eliciting spare respiratory capacity (SRC) ( Figure S3 I). Changes in cell shape were distinct between MTAP and FAMIN siRNA transfection ( Figure S3 J), whereas ADA and PNP siRNA affected proliferation and respiration overall differently from FAMIN siRNA ( Figures S3 H and S3I). Hence, FAMIN and the monofunctional enzymes did not cross-compensate for their individual absence.
We next turned to murine bone marrow (BM)-derived M1 macrophages, in which disease-linked Famin variants cause immunometabolic compromise ( Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to HepG2 cells, macrophages only use purine nucleotide salvage and hardly any de novo synthesis ( Figures S3 K–S3O). ADA, PNP, and MTAP expression is not affected by Famin genotype ( Figure S3 P). Cellular levels of adenine, adenosine, and ATP were lowest in Famin p.284R , intermediate in Famin p.254V , and highest in Famin p.254I macrophages ( Figures 4 C and 4D). MTA followed a similar pattern ( Figure S4 A). Hence, FAMIN increased the availability of adenyl groups, from nucleobase to nucleotide triphosphate. After a 3-h pulse with [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ] adenosine, 14% of cellular adenosine was of the [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ] isotopomer, irrespective of Famin genotype ( Figure 4 E). An even larger fraction of adenine, AMP, SAM cycle, and purine salvage metabolites had label incorporated ( Figure 4 E). They featured adenyl groups that had undergone deamination (i.e., 15 N 5 → 15 N 4 ) and/or phosphorolysis (i.e., 13 C 10 → 13 C 5 ) ( Figure 4 E). Fractional incorporation of 13 C and 15 N into inosine, adenine, and hypoxanthine exhibited significant, although modest, differences across Famin genotypes ( Figure S4 B; Table S6 ). By tracing a 3-h [ 15 N 5 ] adenine pulse, we found that less than 6% of cellular adenine remained unlabeled ( Figure S4 C) and 12% of adenosine was of the [ 15 N 5 ] isotopomer, exhibiting genotype-specific differences ( Figures S4 C–S4E; and Table S6 ). After pulsing with either adenosine or adenine, one-fourth to one-third of AMP and ATP had label incorporated ( Figures 4 E and S4 C). This high adenyl turnover extended to cofactors, i.e., coenzyme A (CoA), SAM, NAD + , NADP, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) ( Figures S4 F and S5 A), again with Famin genotype-specific differences ( Table S6 ). Adenyl metabolism is highly interconnected including fast substrate cycles ( Boison, 2013 10. Boison, D. Adenosine kinase: exploitation for therapeutic gain Pharmacol. Rev. 2013; 65 :906-943 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Exogenous adenosine or adenine would not directly contact FAMIN without prior metabolization, potentially obscuring the extent of FAMIN’s contribution. We, therefore, traced [ 13 C 1 15 N 2 ] guanosine, which has fewer metabolic fates. After a 3-h pulse, fractional incorporation of [ 13 C 1 15 N 2 ] increased from 19.5% ± 1.6% in Famin p.284R to 31.9% ± 1.3% in Famin p.254I macrophages ( Figure 4 F), driven by unlabeled guanosine accumulating in Famin p.284R cells ( Figure S5 B; Table S6 ). Similarly, the fraction of [ 13 C 1 15 N 2 ]-labeled guanine increased from 30.9% ± 3% in Famin p.284R to 46.8% ± 2.6% in Famin p.254I macrophages ( Figure 4 G), whereas total levels of guanine remained constant across genotypes ( Figure S5 B). Fractional labeling of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) was also higher in Famin p.254I than in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R macrophages ( Figure 4 H). Hence, FAMIN activity accounted for >50% higher fractional guanosine and guanine and >30% higher GTP labeling compared to cells without FAMIN activity. This demonstrated that FAMIN profoundly affected purine metabolism.
How does purine metabolism by FAMIN control glycolysis and OXPHOS? Unbiased high-resolution LC-MS of M1 macrophage aqueous extracts revealed 67 LC-MS features of differential abundance between Famin p.254I and Famin p.284R and 157 between Famin p.254I and Famin p.254V cells after false discovery rate (FDR) correction ( Figures 4 I and S5 C). Reassuringly, top dysregulated metabolites were adenine, inosine, hypoxanthine, ADP, AMP, and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) ( Figures 4 I and S5 C). Key metabolites of glycolysis, FAO, amino acid and polyamine metabolism, and the urea cycle were among non-purines dysregulated by FAMIN variants ( Figures 4 I and S5 C). The energetic compromise ( Figure 4 D; Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ) did not lead to increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key energy sensor ( Lin and Hardie, 2018 42. Lin, S.C. ∙ Hardie, D.G. AMPK: Sensing Glucose as well as Cellular Energy Status Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :299-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ), in Famin p.284R compared to Famin p.254I macrophages ( Figure 4 J), consistent with AMP being reduced in parallel with ATP ( Figure 4 I). Massively parallel RNA sequencing of M0, M1, and M2 macrophages revealed only Slc9a9 , Mid1 , and Rap1gap as differentially expressed in Famin p.254V compared to Famin p.254I , and only a further 32 transcripts as different between Famin p.284R and Famin p.254I ( Figure 5 A; Table S7 ). The near-absence of a transcriptional response to the cells’ immunometabolic compromise pointed to a bona fide biochemical mechanism. Slc9a9 , which encodes the Na + -H + transporter 9 (NHE9) ( Slepkov et al., 2007 66. Slepkov, E.R. ∙ Rainey, J.K. ∙ Sykes, B.D. ... Structural and functional analysis of the Na+/H+ exchanger Biochem. J. 2007; 401 :623-633 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ), provided an important clue. Na + -H + transporters dynamically protect against cytoplasmic acidification stemming from the generation of protons (H + ) by metabolic reactions, primarily the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP, P i , and H + ( Casey et al., 2010; Ipata and Pesi, 2018; Robergs et al., 2004 14.

Physiol. 2004; 287 :R502-R516 Crossref Scopus (923) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Gene Ontology set “pH regulation” was duly enriched in Famin p.284R compared to Famin p.254I macrophages ( Figure 5 B). Measuring cytoplasmic pH (pH c ) revealed a more acidic cytoplasm in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R than in Famin p.254I M0 and M1 macrophages ( Figures 5 C and S5 D). Acidification was confirmed by a dual-excitation ratiometric pH c indicator that internally controls for probe uptake ( Figure S5 E) and extended to FAMIN- compared to control-silenced HepG2 cells ( Figure S5 F).
Cytoplasmic acidosis in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R compared to Famin p.254I M1 macrophages was accompanied by elevated levels of cellular P i ( Figure 5 D). Famin –/– macrophages are also depleted of phosphocreatine ( Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), a phosphoryl group carrier for near-immediate ADP rephosphorylation. Cytoplasmic acidosis, P i accumulation, dwindling ATP levels, and depletion of phosphocreatine are hallmarks of exhaustive muscle exercise ( Ipata and Pesi, 2018; Robergs et al., 2004 31. Ipata, P.L. ∙ Pesi, R. Metabolic interaction between purine nucleotide cycle and oxypurine cycle during skeletal muscle contraction of different intensities: a biochemical reappraisal Metabolomics. 2018; 14 :42 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar 61.

Physiol. 2004; 287 :R502-R516 Crossref Scopus (923) PubMed Google Scholar ). They occur when the rate of ATP hydrolysis is higher than fast-paced ADP rephosphorylation by glycolysis and phosphocreatine, hence, when the capacity to recycle H + by creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and (slow) mitochondrial uptake is exceeded. When immediate rephosphorylation is impossible, the myokinase reaction (adenylate kinase, AK1) converts two molecules of ADP into one ATP and one AMP ( Figure 5 E; Ipata et al., 2011 32. Ipata, P.L. ∙ Camici, M. ∙ Micheli, V. ... Metabolic network of nucleosides in the brain Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2011; 11 :909-922 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). In muscle cells, AMP enters the cytoplasmic purine nucleotide cycle (PNC) consisting of AMP deaminase (AMPD), adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS), and adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) ( Ipata and Pesi, 2018; Lowenstein and Tornheim, 1971; Lowenstein, 1990 31. Ipata, P.L. ∙ Pesi, R.

Ammonia production in muscle: the purine nucleotide cycle Science. 1971; 171 :397-400 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). AMPD releases NH 4 + and generates IMP; ADSS synthesizes succinyl-AMP from IMP and aspartate at the expense of GTP; and ADSL regenerates AMP by releasing fumarate, which after conversion to malate enters mitochondria ( Figure 5 E). A reduction of IMP and an increase in aspartate were among few early (24 h; Figure S5 G) changes and a decrease in fumarate and malate among later (48 h; Figure S6 A) changes after FAMIN siRNA transfection into HepG2 cells. Murine primary macrophages express Ampd2 , Ampd3 , Adss , and Adsl ( Figure S6 B). Knockdown of Adss or Adsl in Famin p.254I M0 macrophages reduced baseline oxygen consumption rate (OCR) compared to controls ( Figure 5 F). Uncoupling respiration from mitochondrial ATP synthesis by carbonyl cyanide-4-phenylhydrazone (FCCP; i.e., eliciting SRC) revealed an even larger difference in OCR between Adss and Adsl compared to controls ( Figure 5 F). L -Alanosine is a potent inhibitor of ADSS, the rate limiting step of the PNC ( Tyagi and Cooney, 1980, 1984 71. Tyagi, A.K. ∙ Cooney, D.A. Identification of the antimetabolite of L-alanosine, L-alanosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxylic acid ribonucleotide, in tumors and assessment of its inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase Cancer Res. 1980; 40 :4390-4397 PubMed Google Scholar 72. Tyagi, A.K. ∙ Cooney, D.A. Biochemical pharmacology, metabolism, and mechanism of action of L-alanosine, a novel, natural antitumor agent Adv. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1984; 20 :69-121 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). It dose-dependently reduced baseline OCR and SRC in Famin p.254I M0 macrophages ( Figure 5 G), without affecting non-mitochondrial respiration after antimycin A and rotenone inhibition of the electron transport chain (ETC) ( Figure 5 G). L -Alanosine also reduced baseline and oligomycin-elicited extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in M0 macrophages ( Figure 5 G). Such reduction was also observed upon silencing Adss , Adsl , or the Ampd s ( Figure S6 C). L -Alanosine dose-dependently reduced OCR, SRC, and ECAR in HepG2 cells as well ( Figure S6 D). This coordinated reduction in OCR and ECAR demonstrated that the PNC was active in macrophages and HepG2 cells and controlled OXPHOS and glycolytic activity.
During exhaustive muscle contraction, a fraction of IMP generated in the PNC may enter an “oxypurine” cycle through dephosphorylation to inosine ( Figures 5 E and 6 A; Ipata and Pesi, 2018 31. Ipata, P.L. ∙ Pesi, R. Metabolic interaction between purine nucleotide cycle and oxypurine cycle during skeletal muscle contraction of different intensities: a biochemical reappraisal Metabolomics. 2018; 14 :42 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). By the oxypurine cycle, the purine ring may re-enter the PNC after salvage by PNP and HPRT, which is thought to retain the purine ring pool as nucleosides and nucleobases could efflux. FAMIN could support such a substrate cycle for inosine and additionally provide an entry point for AMP-derived adenosine with salvage routes by HPRT or directly by APRT ( Figures 5 E and 6 A) and, thereby, promote flux through the PNC. As reported ( Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), baseline OCR, SRC, and ECAR were highest in Famin p.254I , intermediate in Famin p.254V , and lowest in Famin p.284R M0 macrophages ( Figure 6 B). L -Alanosine reduced levels of OCR, SRC, and ECAR in Famin p.254I and Famin p.254V M0 macrophages to levels in Famin p.284R cells, while not further reducing them in the latter ( Figure 6 B). L -Alanosine also curtailed ECAR in M1 macrophages, again only in those with active FAMIN ( Figure 6 C). Despite reducing glycolysis, L -alanosine acidified the cytoplasm in Famin p.254I and Famin p.254V M1 macrophages to the level of Famin p.284R cells, where L -alanosine did not further lower the pH c ( Figure 6 D). Hence, FAMIN activity was essential for a PNC to ensue, which, in turn, controlled rates of OXPHOS and glycolysis and set the pH c .
We next studied the aspartate supplying the PNC ( Figure 6 A). Uptake of [ 15 N 2 ] aspartate into M1 macrophages was negligible (data not shown), consistent with most cultured cells’ reliance on de novo synthesis ( Birsoy et al., 2015 9. Birsoy, K. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Chen, W.W. ... An Essential Role of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain in Cell Proliferation Is to Enable Aspartate Synthesis Cell. 2015; 162 :540-551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aspartate derives its carbons from oxaloacetate and its nitrogen from glutamate. Oxaloacetate can be generated from (1) malate by cytosolic or mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, (2) pyruvate by mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase, and (3) citrate by cytosolic ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) ( Birsoy et al., 2015 9. Birsoy, K. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Chen, W.W. ... An Essential Role of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain in Cell Proliferation Is to Enable Aspartate Synthesis Cell. 2015; 162 :540-551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ). A portion of cellular ACLY and FASN, with which FAMIN interacts ( Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), tethers to peroxisomes ( Hillebrand et al., 2012 30. Hillebrand, M. ∙ Gersting, S.W. ∙ Lotz-Havla, A.S. ... Identification of a new fatty acid synthesis-transport machinery at the peroxisomal membrane J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :210-221 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Higher OXPHOS and glycolytic activity in Famin +/+ than Famin –/– macrophages required FAO and fatty acid synthesis ( Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). FAO-derived acetyl-CoA provides two carbons that combine with oxaloacetate to mitochondrial citrate, while ACLY cleaves citrate exported to the cytoplasm into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA that supplies fatty acid synthesis ( Figure 6 A). After a 3-h [ 13 C 16 ] palmitate pulse, 20%–30% of citrate was of the [ 13 C 2 ] isotopomer in M0 and M1 macrophages ( Figure S7 A), confirming both oxidise fatty acids. [ 13 C 16 ] Palmitate-pulsed M0 cells also exhibited isotopomers with >2 carbons labeled ( Figure S7 B), i.e., citrate that had undergone at least one full oxidation cycle. This allowed tracing the oxaloacetate carbons ( Figure 6 A). Fractional incorporation into aspartate after the [ 13 C 16 ] palmitate pulse was substantial (∼30%) and higher in Famin p.254I and Famin p.254V than in Famin p.284R M0 macrophages ( Figure 6 E; Table S6 ). It was also higher into fumarate in Famin p.254I than in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R M0 macrophages ( Figure 6 F; Table S6 ), with the fumarate:aspartate fractional labeling ratio highest in Famin p.254I cells ( Figure S7 C). SB-204990, a selective ACLY inhibitor ( Granchi, 2018 29. Granchi, C. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibitors: An anti-cancer strategy at the crossroads of glucose and lipid metabolism Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2018; 157 :1276-1291 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ), indeed lowered OCR and ECAR most markedly in Famin p.254I and Famin p.254V M0 macrophages ( Figure 6 G). No citrate isotopomers beyond [ 13 C 2 ] were observed in M1 macrophages ( Figure S7 D), consistent with a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle break after citrate ( Jha et al., 2015 33. Jha, A.K. ∙ Huang, S.C. ∙ Sergushichev, A. ... Network integration of parallel metabolic and transcriptional data reveals metabolic modules that regulate macrophage polarization Immunity. 2015; 42 :419-430 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1359) PubMed Google Scholar ), and accordingly, no [ 13 C] incorporation into aspartate and fumarate was detected ( Figure S7 D). Total citrate levels, however, were ∼2-fold higher in Famin p.254I than in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R M1 macrophages ( Figure S7 E). Altogether, these findings suggested that a seemingly futile cycle of FAO and fatty acid synthesis, also observed in other contexts ( Yao et al., 2016 77. Yao, C.H. ∙ Fowle-Grider, R. ∙ Mahieu, N.G. ... Exogenous Fatty Acids Are the Preferred Source of Membrane Lipids in Proliferating Fibroblasts Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23 :483-493 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), was involved in pulling TCA cycle oxaloacetate via ACLY into aspartate and through the PNC into fumarate.
Glucose was not a major carbon source for aspartate in M1 macrophages, with 1-h and 3-h [ 13 C 6 ] glucose pulses resulting in ∼1.5% [ 13 C 3 ] aspartate ( Figure S7 F; Table S6 ). Glutamine, by glutamate ( Birsoy et al., 2015; Sullivan et al., 2015 9. Birsoy, K. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Chen, W.W. ... An Essential Role of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain in Cell Proliferation Is to Enable Aspartate Synthesis Cell. 2015; 162 :540-551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Sullivan, L.B. ∙ Gui, D.Y. ∙ Hosios, A.M. ... Supporting Aspartate Biosynthesis Is an Essential Function of Respiration in Proliferating Cells Cell. 2015; 162 :552-563 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (774) PubMed Google Scholar ), was an important source of de novo aspartate carbon, but with [ 13 C] aspartate after a 3-h [ 13 C 5 15 N 2 ] glutamine pulse trending lower in Famin p.254I than Famin p.284R cells ( Figure S7 G; Table S6 ), it was unlikely to supply the PNC.
We finally asked whether the metabolic compromise due to impaired FAMIN can be rescued. Fumarate and malate, which can be taken up by plasma membrane transporters ( Pajor, 2014 55. Pajor, A.M. Sodium-coupled dicarboxylate and citrate transporters from the SLC13 family Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466 :119-130 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), increased baseline OCR and SRC in HepG2 cells with L -alanosine-blocked PNC ( Figure 7 A). Fumarate and malate partially rescued baseline OCR and SRC in FAMIN - but not control-silenced HepG2 cells ( Figure 7 B). Exogenous fumarate partially rescued OCR and SRC in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R M0 macrophages but did not augment respiration in Famin p.254I cells ( Figure 7 C). OXPHOS requires H + and P i import into the mitochondrial matrix. Fumarate and malate completely rescued cytoplasmic acidification in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R M0 macrophages; they attained a pH c equivalent to untreated Famin p.254I cells, in which fumarate and malate did not affect pH c ( Figures 7 D and S7 H). Fumarate and malate similarly rescued the acidic pH c in L -alanosine-treated HepG2 cells ( Figure S7 I) and, remarkably, also in Famin p.284R M1 macrophages ( Figure 7 E), which are thought not to pursue OXPHOS ( Mills et al., 2016 49. Mills, E.L. ∙ Kelly, B. ∙ Logan, A. ... Succinate Dehydrogenase Supports Metabolic Repurposing of Mitochondria to Drive Inflammatory Macrophages Cell. 2016; 167 :457-470.e413 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1391) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) defect in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R compared to Famin p.254I M1 macrophages, present despite unaltered mitochondrial biomass and membrane potential (ΔΨ m ) ( Figures S7 J and S7K), was also fully rescued by exogenous fumarate, whereas fumarate did not augment mtROS production in Famin p.254I cells ( Figure 7 F). Importantly, fumarate also rescued the glycolysis defect of Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R M0 macrophages, as revealed by increased baseline and oligomycin-elicited ECAR but did not augment ECAR in Famin p.254I cells ( Figure 7 C). Altogether, this was consistent with a FAMIN-dependent PNC sparking OXPHOS, increasing H + uptake into mitochondria, and promoting glycolysis.
A 3-h [ 13 C 2 ] fumarate pulse, at the concentration that rescued the metabolic compromise, labeled ∼60% and ∼30% of cellular fumarate in M0 and M1 cells, respectively, resulting in ∼15% and ∼30% of cellular malate labeled ( Figures S7 L and S7M). Notably, [ 13 C] did not incorporate into citrate in M0 and only labeled ∼2% of citrate in M1 macrophages ( Figure 7 G), excluding direct anaplerosis. We detected, however, [ 13 C 2 ] succinate in M1 and, surprisingly, also in M0 cells ( Figures 7 H and S7 N) and [ 13 C 2 ] aspartate also in both macrophage types ( Figures 7 I and S7 O). We confirmed the generation of [ 13 C 4 ] succinate from fully labeled [ 13 C 4 ] fumarate in both M1 and M0 macrophages after a 24-h pulse ( Figures 7 J and 7K). This implied fumarate accepted electrons from coenzyme Q (CoQH 2 ) by a reverse succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; complex II) reaction, while conceivably increasing the capacity of the malate/aspartate shuttle (MAS). Reducing equivalents from glycolysis are imported into mitochondria by the MAS and the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (G3PS), thereby regenerating NAD + required for the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) reaction ( Figure 6 A; Robergs et al., 2004 61. Robergs, R.A. ∙ Ghiasvand, F. ∙ Parker, D. Biochemistry of exercise-induced metabolic acidosis Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287 :R502-R516 Crossref Scopus (923) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MAS transfers electrons to mitochondrial NAD + before they enter the ETC, whereas the G3PS transfers them directly to CoQ ( Mráček et al., 2013 50. Mráček, T. ∙ Drahota, Z. ∙ Houštěk, J. The function and the role of the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in mammalian tissues Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827 :401-410 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). The total cellular NAD + /NADH ratio was gradually diminished from Famin p.254I by Famin p.254V to Famin p.284R M1 macrophages ( Figure 7 L). A 1-h [ 13 C 6 ] glucose pulse resulted in ∼90% of hexose-6-phosphate present as the [ 13 C 6 ] isotopomer in Famin p.254I M1 macrophages, and this fraction was lower in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R cells ( Figure S7 P), consistent with reduced glycolytic flux. At the same time, however, 55% of sn -glycerol-3-phosphate ( sn G3P) exhibited [ 13 C 3 ] labeling in Famin p.254I cells, and this was strikingly ∼10%–15% higher in Famin p.254V and Famin p.284R M1 macrophages ( Figure 7 M), which is indicative of a stalled GAPDH. sn G3P is the reduced form of the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) ( Figure 6 A), with which it forms the redox pair of the G3PS. sn G3P was among the top dysregulated metabolites in the unbiased survey ( Figure 4 I), with cellular levels higher in Famin p.284R cells than the genotypes with active FAMIN ( Figure S7 Q). Altogether, this demonstrated that the FAMIN-enabled PNC balances the redox interface between glycolysis and the mitochondrial ETC by the fumarate it generates.

Section: Discussion

Here, we report FAMIN as a prototype of a new family of multifunctional purine enzymes conserved from bacteria to man. FAMIN combines adenosine phosphorylase activity, previously thought to be absent from eukaryotic metabolism, with activities analogous to ADA, PNP, and MTAP. The latter three enzymes had been considered the sole routes supplying purine nucleotide salvage, ADA and adenosine kinase (ADK) the only routes of adenosine conversion, and MTAP the sole route of adenine generation ( Albers, 2009; Boison, 2013; Camici et al., 2018; Kamatani and Carson, 1981 2.

Dependence of adenine production upon polyamine synthesis in cultured human lymphoblasts Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 675 :344-350 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). FAMIN enables a PNC that controls pH c and redox state and sets the pace of mitochondrial and glycolytic activity.
Adenine and ribose are considered primordial metabolites from which life emerged from prebiotic chemistry ( Ralser, 2018 60. Ralser, M. An appeal to magic? The discovery of a non-enzymatic metabolism and its role in the origins of life Biochem. J. 2018; 475 :2577-2592 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). The combination of key activities of adenyl metabolism in one single enzyme is intriguing. FAMIN’s low catalytic rates appear disproportionate to its huge impact on cellular metabolism, possibly hinting to cofactors not present in our assays. Our YlmD structure identifies a single nucleoside-binding site, with the Cys 125 -His 80 -His 142 triad, which is conserved across DUF152 proteins and FAMIN (residues Cys 284 , His 250 , and His 301 ), coordinating the ribose moiety of inosine. The structures of DUF152 proteins suggest one single active site ( Kim et al., 2006 35. Kim, Y. ∙ Maltseva, N. ∙ Dementieva, I. ... Crystal structure of hypothetical protein YfiH from Shigella flexneri at 2 A resolution Proteins. 2006; 63 :1097-1101 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fold and active site architecture of YlmD and DUF152 are unrelated to those of purine and pyrimidine amidohydrolases, such as ADA, and of phosphorolytic enzymes ( Appleby et al., 1999; Ealick et al., 1990; Kim et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 1991 3.

Atomic structure of adenosine deaminase complexed with a transition-state analog: understanding catalysis and immunodeficiency mutations Science. 1991; 252 :1278-1284 Crossref Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ). A select few examples of enzymes have been described that catalyze at a single active site chemically distinct, physiologically utilized reactions. They were mostly discovered in bacteria with reduced genomes and may be reminiscent of long-extinct early cellular life that was likely much simpler, with few low activity enzymes performing multiple functions ( Ferla et al., 2017; Say and Fuchs, 2010; Seelig, 2017 23.

Multifunctional enzymes from reduced genomes - model proteins for simple primordial metabolism? Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 105 :505-507 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is tempting to speculate that FAMIN and its antecedents may offer a glimpse into the ancient past, with its control over metabolic pace by redox state and pH. The pattern of FAMIN orthologs across species may suggest horizontal gene transfer. Orthologs are restricted to chordates within eukaryotes and to prokaryotic phyla typically present in the intestinal microbiota, an ecological niche of minuscule oxygen tension. The I254V variation is also an important difference between human and mouse, with C57BL/6 mice expressing Famin p.254V .
A PNC has not previously been reported in cells of the immune system. Lowenstein and colleagues first demonstrated a PNC, geared to stabilize an exercising muscle cell’s “energy charge” and releasing ammonia proportionate to work ( Embden and Wassermeyer, 1928; Lowenstein and Tornheim, 1971; Lowenstein, 1972, 1990; van Waarde, 1988 21.

By funneling their amino nitrogen into the PNC, e.g., branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) become accessible to oxidation and carboxylation and, thereby, contribute to muscle anaplerosis ( Arinze, 2005; Lowenstein, 1972, 1990 5.

Sports Med. 1990; 11 :S37-S46 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). The promotion of glycolysis has also been linked to the muscle PNC, albeit the mechanism remained unclear ( Lowenstein, 1972; Sugden and Newsholme, 1975; van Waarde, 1988 44. Lowenstein, J.M.

Soc. 1988; 63 :259-298 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). A PNC in macrophages ensues only when FAMIN is active, as ADSS inhibition reduced OXPHOS, glycolysis, and pH c to levels identical to those in FAMIN-deficient cells and no further in them. Interestingly, fumarate (and malate) rescued the acidic pH c and the depressed mtROS production of FAMIN-deficient cells completely but the compromised OXPHOS and glycolysis only partially. No augmentation by exogenous fumarate occurred in cells with fully active FAMIN. Exogenous fumarate might not rescue processes feeding into aspartate entering the PNC, as exemplified by BCAA contributing to anaplerosis in muscle. The fumarate rescue itself entails substantial complexity, with mitochondrial import after hydration to malate by electroneutral transporters that exchange malate for α-ketoglutarate (part of the MAS), citrate (supplying ACLY), or phosphate ( Palmieri, 2004, 2013 56. Palmieri, F. The mitochondrial transporter family (SLC25): physiological and pathological implications Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447 :689-709 Crossref Scopus (648) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Palmieri, F. The mitochondrial transporter family SLC25: identification, properties and physiopathology Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34 :465-484 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ) and electrogenic exchange of aspartate – for glutamate – + H + (as part of the MAS). Mitochondrial H + import occurs by the MAS and the G3PS, P i /H + symport and cation exchange mechanisms ( Robergs et al., 2004 61. Robergs, R.A. ∙ Ghiasvand, F. ∙ Parker, D. Biochemistry of exercise-induced metabolic acidosis Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287 :R502-R516 Crossref Scopus (923) PubMed Google Scholar ), hence, rectifying an imbalance in mitochondrial electron import by exogenous fumarate may directly rescue cytoplasmic acidosis.
Our data indeed suggest that PNC-supplied fumarate synchronizes mitochondrial activity with glycolysis by balancing electron transfer into mitochondria between the G3PS and MAS. Although both shuttles are likely affected, we favor a model where the primary redox perturbation in FAMIN-impaired macrophages arises from the G3PS. Specifically, glycolysis-derived electrons transferred by the G3PS to CoQ may be accepted by PNC-derived fumarate to form succinate ( Figure 6 A). In the absence of fumarate as (terminal) electron acceptor, mitochondrial superoxide production collapses, sn G3P accumulates, NADH is not recycled to NAD + , and GAPDH stalls. GPD2, the ETC sn G3P dehydrogenase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme of the G3PS, can generate high levels of mtROS ( Mráček et al., 2013, 2014 50. Mráček, T. ∙ Drahota, Z. ∙ Houštěk, J.

Observing [ 13 C 4 ] succinate in [ 13 C 4 ] fumarate-pulsed M0 macrophages was surprising and controversially points toward a (small) fraction of SDH/complex II operating in reverse in parallel with its forward reaction in the TCA and ETC. Supporting fumarate respiration, present in many microaerophiles and anaerobes ( Cook et al., 2014; Kröger et al., 1992 18. Cook, G.M. ∙ Greening, C. ∙ Hards, K. ...

Bacterial fumarate respiration Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158 :311-314 Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar ), might be the evolutionary context of DUF152 proteins. It will be interesting to explore whether such parallel reverse SDH activity exists in mammalian cells and what the spatial basis is.
In summary, FAMIN and its orthologs rewrite core purine metabolism by revealing a surprising new layer of adenyl turnover. Even prior to this discovery, adenyl metabolism had been considered the most highly interconnected and exquisitely tuned metabolic circuitry in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

6- to 10-week-old mice were used for all experiments and were age- and gender-matched for individual experiments. C57BL/6N Famin p.254I , Famin p.254V , Famin p.284R , Famin +/+ and Famin –/– mice have previously been described ( Cader et al., 2016 12. Cader, M.Z. ∙ Boroviak, K. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... C13orf31 (FAMIN) is a central regulator of immunometabolic function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1046-1056 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were heterozygously bred and for all experiments littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Central Biomedical Services facility, University of Cambridge. All procedures performed had local ethics and UK Home Office approval.
HepG2 (RRID: CVCL_0027), an adherent cell line isolated from liver lesions of a male Caucasian patient (ATCC HB-8065), and HEK293T (RRID: CVCL_0063) a cell line derived from human fetal kidney (ATCC CRL-3216) were maintained in DMEM medium and kept in a 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) incubator at 37°C. Unless otherwise stated, all culture media were supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (1%) and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10%). All cell lines used in this study were authenticated and purchased from ATCC and are not included within the register of misidentified cell lines curated by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee registry (ICLAC).
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were prepared by flushing mouse femurs and tibias with PBS. Cells were filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and re-suspended in complete RPMI-1640 medium (containing 100 U/mL of penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mM HEPES buffer and 10% FBS). To generate BMDMs, cells were cultured for 6 days in complete medium containing 100 ng/mL of M-CSF with media exchanged after 3 days. Macrophages were harvested, seeded and polarized for 24 h toward M1 macrophages with IFN-γ (50 ng/mL) plus LPS (20 ng/mL), or toward M2 macrophages with IL-4 (20 ng/mL), or left unstimulated and used as M0 macrophages. For adenosine, guanosine, adenine, fumarate and palmitate tracing experiments, M0 macrophages and/or M1 macrophages were pulsed for 3 h or as indicated with 50 μM [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ] adenosine, [ 15 N 5 ] adenine, [ 13 C 1 15 N 2 ] guanosine or 100 μM [ 13 C 16 ] palmitate (6:1 conjugation with BSA) or 300 μM [ 13 C 2 ] fumarate, [ 13 C 4 ] fumarate prior to direct extraction with 4:1 methanol/H 2 O. For glucose tracing experiments, M1 macrophages were cultured for 1 h or as indicated in RPMI glucose-free medium supplemented with 2 g/L of [ 13 C 6 ] glucose prior to direct methanol extraction. For glutamine tracing experiments, M1 macrophages were cultured with RPMI-glutamine free medium supplemented with 2 mM of [ 13 C 5 15 N 2 ] glutamine or [ 15 N 2 ] glutamine for 24 h prior to direct methanol extraction.
Complementary DNA encoding human FAMIN 254I ( NP_001121775 , NM_001128303 ) was cloned into a pESG-IBA105 vector (IBA Life Sciences) that contains an N-terminal Twin-Strep-tag and TEV cleavage motif. The FAMIN 254V construct was generated via site-directed mutagenesis using a Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England BioLabs), following manufacturer’s instructions. Sequences for YfiH (Uniprot P33644 , PDB 1Z9T ; from Escherichia coli strain K12, phylum Proteobacteria ) and YlmD (Uniprot P84138 , PDB 1T8H ; from Geobacillus stearothermophilus , phylum Firmicutes ) were synthesized by Origene and cloned into a pPSG-IBA105 vector (IBA Life Sciences). For FAMIN and FAMIN Δ176 (amino acids 176-430 of FAMIN) MBP fusion proteins, FAMIN cDNA sequences were synthesized by GenScript and codon-optimized for prokaryotic expression, and cloned into a pMAL-C5x (New England BioLabs) vector downstream of a MBP tag that is linked to Factor Xa and TEV protease cleavage motifs.
HEK293T cells were transfected with PEI-DNA complex containing the Strep-tagged FAMIN expression plasmids. After 48-72 h, transfected cells were harvested in PBS and centrifuged twice at 800 × g for 3 min and the pellet resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM TCEP and 10% glycerol pH 7.6) supplemented with Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) plus PMSF at 1 mM. Following sonication and clearance by centrifugation at 50,000 × g, the lysates were then loaded onto a Streptactin XT Superflow column (IBA Life Sciences) pre-equilibrated with at least 4 column volumes of lysis buffer. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES, 1 mM TCEP and 10% glycerol pH 7.6) and the Strep-tagged protein was eluted from the column with 6 column volumes of 50 mM biotin. The purified recombinant protein was then incubated with His-tagged TEV protease (Sigma) at a ratio of 10:1 as determined by A280 quantification using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C. TEV protease was then removed by passing the mixture through a pre-equilibrated 1 mL Ni-NTA Superflow column (IBA Life Sciences). The flow-through constituting tag-free recombinant protein was collected. This was then concentrated with a 10 kDa column filter (Amicon) and further purified by size exclusion using an AKTA Superdex 200 increase (10/300) column (GE Life Sciences) column, followed by copious washing. Eluted fractions corresponding to positive peaks on the chromatogram were confirmed on Coomassie SDS-PAGE. Streptactin-purified FAMIN with retained tag exhibited activity indistinguishable from protein prepared, as described above, and was used in select experiments as indicated in the legend.
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with MBP-full length FAMIN or MBP-FAMIN Δ176 expression plasmids and grown at 30°C in ampicillin supplemented LB media. Expression was induced at an OD600 of 0.5 – 0.7 with 0.3 mM IPTG for 4 h. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets washed twice with PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer containing 20mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0, 1× cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The cells were lysed by sonication on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 35,000× g for 30 minutes. The soluble fraction was treated with 5 μg / mL of DNase I (Sigma) and 10 μg / mL of RNase A (Sigma) for 15 minutes on ice. The protein-containing supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 µm filter, diluted in 10× volume of lysis buffer, and then loaded onto a pre-equilibrated dextrin sepharose MBPTrap High Performance column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of modified lysis buffer containing 750 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted with 10 column volumes of a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM maltose, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0. The eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated for use in further assays.
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the YlmD or YfiH expression plasmid were grown at 37°C in LB media containing 100 mg l −1 ampicillin. Expression was induced at an OD600 of 0.6 with 0.1 mM IPTG for 18 h at 18°C. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 1:10,000 (v/v) benzonase solution (Sigma), 1 × cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The cells were lysed by sonication on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30 min, 35,000 × g ). The protein-containing supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and loaded onto a 5 mL StrepTrap column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT. The protein was eluted using 4 column volumes of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 2.5 mM D-desthiobiotin. The elution fractions were pooled and further purified using on a Superdex 200 increase (10/300) size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP.
YlmD was concentrated to 5.6 mg ml -1 and crystal hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments were set up at 22°C in EasyXtal 15-well DG-tool plates (QIAGEN). Hanging drops were set up by mixing 1.5 μl of protein and 1.5 μl of reservoir solution, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 25% PEG 6000. For data collection without inosine, crystals were harvested and soaked for 5-10 min in cryoprotectant containing 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 25% PEG 6000 and 20% glycerol. For data collection in the presence of inosine, crystals were soaked for 45-60 min in cryoprotectant containing 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 25% PEG 6000, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 mM zinc sulfate and 18.7 mM inosine. Overnight soaks with inosine and co-crystallization with inosine resulted in lower-resolution diffraction without improving electron density for bound inosine. The crystals were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at Diamond Light Source beamlines I03 and I04 and processed with autoPROC ( Vonrhein et al., 2011 75. Vonrhein, C. ∙ Flensburg, C. ∙ Keller, P. ... Data processing and analysis with the autoPROC toolbox Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :293-302 Crossref Scopus (1202) PubMed Google Scholar ) and STARANISO ( Tickle et al., 2018 70. Tickle, I.J. ∙ Flensburg, C. ∙ Keller, P. ... STARANISO Global Phasing Ltd, 2018 Google Scholar ).
The structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser using the available structure of YlmD (PDB 1T8H ) as the search model ( McCoy et al., 2007 48. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (16093) PubMed Google Scholar ). Models were iteratively refined in Fourier space using data up to 1.2 Å resolution with REFMAC ( Chen et al., 2010; Otwinowski and Minor, 1997 15. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, III, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ...

Cells were harvested as indicated using either direct extraction with 4:1 methanol:water or trypsin-EDTA (0.25%). Unless otherwise indicated, for direct methanol extraction, cells were washed twice with PBS followed by addition of pre-chilled 4:1 methanol:water. Cells were scraped and the resulting methanol mixture transferred to 2 mL-flat-bottomed screw cap tubes. Samples were then vortexed, sonicated and lastly centrifuged at 21,000 g for 10 minutes to pellet any debris. The supernatant was transferred to new 2 mL tubes for drying as described below. Measurement of cellular P i levels necessitated phosphate-free buffer wash steps, with PBS replaced by a buffer consisting of 162mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.4). All solvents used were HPLC grade or higher and obtained from Honeywell (Fisher Scientific).
Cell pellets harvested using trypsinization were washed with PBS and then subjected to extraction using the methanol:chloroform method described by Folch et al. (1957) 24. Folch, J. ∙ Lees, M. ∙ Sloane Stanley, G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226 :497-509 Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, a stainless steel ball (QIAGEN) was added to each washed cell pellet on dry ice along with 1 mL of ice cold 2:1 chloroform:methanol inside a 2 mL-flat-bottomed screw cap tube (Starlab). The samples were homogenized using a Tissue Lyser (QIAGEN) for 10 min at 25 Hz to ensure optimum extraction and ascertaining to freeze the tissue lyser plates prior to homogenization in order to keep samples cold during extraction. 400 μL of ice cold water was added and the samples thoroughly vortexed and sonicated for 5 minutes before centrifugation at 21,000 g for 5 min. After centrifugation the aqueous (top layer) and organic (bottom layer) fractions were separated and aliquoted into separate screw-cap tubes both kept on dry ice. A further 1 mL of 2:1 chloroform:methanol was added to the original tube containing the protein pellet and the extraction repeated as described above. The resulting layers were combined, dried (as described below) and stored at −20°C prior to further preparation and analysis.
Aqueous extracts of cells or protein reaction mixtures were lyophilised using a centrifugal evaporator (Savant, Thermo Scientific) and reconstituted in 100 μL (for cell extracts) and 200 μL (for protein reaction mixtures) of 7:3 acetonitrile: 0.1 M aqueous ammonium carbonate containing 2 μM [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ] adenosine monophosphate, [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ] adenosine triphosphate, 10 μM [ 13 C 4 ] succinic acid and 10 μM [ 13 C 5 15 N 5 ] glutamic acid (all from Sigma Aldrich except the glutamic acid from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as internal standards, although it should be noted that for experiments using labeled substrates, internal standards were omitted to avoid contamination of metabolites. The resulting solution was vortexed then sonicated for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 21,000 g to pellet any remaining undissolved material. Samples not run in HILIC mode were reconstituted directly with 50 μL of aqueous 10 mM ammonium acetate containing 2 μM [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ] adenosine monophosphate, adenosine triphosphate [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ], 10 μM [ 13 C 4 ] succinic acid and a 2 in 100000 dilution of a cell free amino acid mixture containing all the proteinogenic amino acids U[ 13 C 15 N] labeled. Samples were thoroughly vortexed and sonicated as above. After centrifugation the supernatants were transferred with an automatic pipette into a 300 μL vial (Fisher Scientific) and capped ready for analysis. Ammonium carbonate and ammonium acetate were Optima grade obtained from Fisher Scientific.
For untargeted analysis, a Velos Pro Elite orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a U3000 chromatography system or a Q Exactive Plus orbitrap coupled to a Vanquish Horizon ultra high performance liquid chromatography system was used. For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed using a Quantiva triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to a Vanquish Horizon (all analytical instrument combinations supplied by Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Samples were then analyzed using a bridged ethylene hybrid (BEH) amide hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) approach for the highly polar aqueous metabolites. For this analysis the strong mobile phase (A) was 100 mM ammonium carbonate, the weak mobile phase was acetonitrile (B) with 1:1 water:acetonitrile being used for the needle wash. The LC column used was the BEH amide column (150 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters). The following linear gradient was used: 20% A in acetonitrile for 1.5 min followed by an increase to 60% A over 2.5 min with a further 1 min at 60% A after which the column was re-equilibrated for 1.9 min. After each chromatographic run the column was washed with 30 column volumes of 6:4 water:acetonitrile followed by a further 10 column volumes of 95:5 acetonitrile:water for storage. The total run time was 7 min, the flow rate was 0.6 mL/min and the injection volume was 5 μL. In order to resolve pentose phosphates for identification of ribose-1-phosphate a shallower gradient was employed: 30% A in acetonitrile for 2.0 minutes followed by an increase to 50% A over 3.0 minutes with re-equilibration for 1.9 minutes. After HILIC analysis samples were dried and reconstituted in the same volume of 10 mM ammonium acetate (for samples not run in HILIC mode this drying step was omitted) prior to orthogonal mixed mode analysis using an ACE Excel C18-PFP column (150 × 2.1 mm, 2.0 μm, Hichrom). Mobile phase A consisted of water with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. For gradient elution mobile phase B was held at 0% for 1.6 min followed by a linear gradient to 30% B over 4.0 minutes, a further increase to 90% over 1 min and a hold at 90% B for 1 min with re-equilibration for 1.5 minutes giving a total run time of 6.5 minutes. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and the injection volume was 2 μL. The needle wash used was 1:1 water:acetonitrile. Both chromatography modes were used for both targeted and untargeted analysis.
For basic pH reversed phase LC-MS analysis of analytes such as nucleoside phosphates and inorganic phosphate (P i ; 96.9696 in negative ESI) in samples reconstituted in aqueous ammonium acetate, a base stable Phenomenex Gemini NX-C18 (150 × 2 mm, 3 μm) (Phenomenex Ltd., Macclesfield, UK) column was employed using the following chromatography method with a weak mobile phase (A) of 10 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% ammonia and a strong mobile phase (B) of acetonitrile. Mobile phase B was held at 0% for 1.6 min, followed by a linear gradient to 30% B over 4.0 minutes, a further increase to 90% over 1 min, and a hold at 90% B for 1 min, with re-equilibration for 1.5 minutes giving a total run time of 6.5 minutes. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and the injection volume was 2 μL. The needle wash used was 1:1 water:acetonitrile.
For enzyme kinetic assays requiring quantitation of ribose-1-phosphate a further chromatographic approach was used to allow for analysis of all substrates and products using a single assay. A Waters BEH C8 column was used (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) with a weak mobile phase (A) of aqueous 10 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% ammonia and a strong mobile phase (B) of acetonitrile. For gradient elution mobile phase B was held at 0% for 1.6 min, followed by a linear gradient to 30% B over 4.0 minutes, a further increase to 90% over 1 min, and a hold at 90% B for 1 min, with re-equilibration for 1.5 minutes giving a total run time of 6.5 minutes. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and the injection volume was 2 μL. The needle wash used was 1:1 water:acetonitrile. For those assays requiring only nucleotide and nucleoside quantitation the acidic C18-PFP approach described above was used. The ammonium formate was Optima grade supplied by Fisher Scientific.
Untargeted analysis on the Elite used a high resolution FTMS full scan of 60-1500 m/z with a resolution of 60,000 ppm, where due to positive mode negative mode equilibration times each mode was run independently. Source parameters used for the orbitrap were a vaporizer temperature of 400°C, an ion transfer tube temperature of 300°C, an ion spray voltage of 3.5 kV (2.5 kV for negative ion mode) and a sheath gas, auxiliary gas and sweep gas of 55, 15 and 3 arbitrary units respectively with an S-lens RF (radio frequency) of 60%. For untargeted analysis using the Q Exactive Plus a full scan of 60-900 m/z was used at a resolution of 70,000 ppm where positive and negative ion mode assays were run separately in order to maximize data points across a peak at the chosen resolution. The source parameters were the same as those used for the Elite. For analysis of CoA species and reducing equivalents using the Q Exactive Plus orbitrap unique mass spectrometry methodology was employed where the full scan mass range was reduced to 500-1000 m/z , the capillary temperature was increased to 350°C and the S-lens RF to 100%.
Targeted analysis on the Quantiva utilized selected reaction monitoring (SRM) employing fast polarity switching with mass transitions and compound dependent parameters (collision energy voltage and RF lens voltage) determined on infusion of 1 μM standards at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in 4:1 acetonitrile:water with 0.1% acetic acid. Source parameters used were a vaporizer temperature of 440°C and ion transfer tube temperature of 362°C, an ion spray voltage of 3.5 kV (2.5 kV for negative ion mode) and a sheath gas, auxiliary gas and sweep gas of 54, 17 and 2 arbitrary units respectively. All fragmentation experiments were carried out using high energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 25eV.
For quantitation of enzyme reaction products in order to determine V max and K m values a unique sample preparation was employed. Dried enzyme assay samples were reconstituted in 200 μL of 10 mM ammonium acetate containing 1 μM [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ] adenosine, [ 15 N 5 ] adenine, [ 15 N 4 ] inosine (all obtained through Cambridge Isotope laboratories) and [ 13 C 5 15 N 2 ] hypoxanthine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Ltd., Dallas, TX, USA), thoroughly vortexed, sonicated and transferred to 300 μL glass vials and capped for analysis. Enzyme assay samples using substrate concentrations above 10 μM were further diluted to an effective concentration of 10 μM in the same reconstitution buffer to avoid concentrations above the linear analytical range of the instrumentation. Samples were run using the C18-PFP method described above on the Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap (using established instrumental parameters) with an injection volume of 2 μL. Blank injections were placed in between each test sample to eliminate carry-over effects.
Data were acquired, processed and integrated using Xcalibur (Version 3.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Compound Discoverer (Version 2.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For targeted analysis, metabolites of interest were identified using high resolution m/z values as specified in the METLIN database (Scripps Research Institute) corresponding to their [M+H] + or [M-H] – ion adducts in positive or negative ionisation modes, respectively. Compound retention time and fragmentation pattern were validated against known external standards. Peak areas corresponding to metabolite levels were manually quantified and normalized to internal standard or total ion content (as appropriate). NAD + /NADH ratios were quantified as relative levels and hence relative ratios have been provided.
For untargeted multivariate analysis performed as part of the screen for enzymatic activity and macrophage metabolomics, data were processed using Compound Discoverer (Version 2.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to determine unique LC-MS features with differential abundance between sample groups. For each differential MS feature, chromatogram peaks were manually verified using Xcalibur (Version 3.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Accurate m/z values of putative compounds were compared against the METLIN database (Scripps Research Institute) including [M+H] + , [M+Na] + , [M+NH 4 ] + for positive mode and [M-H] – , [M+Cl] – for negative mode ion adducts with a mass tolerance of 2ppm. A combination of MS/MS fragmentation profile, molecular formulae calculation based on isotope pattern and expected chromatographic chemical behavior was then used to attribute metabolite identity. In case of ambiguity, and for all proposed FAMIN products and substrates, external standards were used to confirm metabolite identification. Data from positive and negative ionisation modes were combined and duplicate metabolite identities removed. Data was normalized to total ion content and fold change graphically depicted as volcano plots. Metabolite levels between groups were compared using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test. For macrophage metabolomics Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing was applied.
For tracing experiments with [ 13 C 10 15 N 5 ] adenosine, [ 15 N 5 ] adenine, [ 13 C 1 15 N 2 ] guanosine, [ 13 C 16 ] palmitate, [ 13 C 6 ] glucose, [ 13 C 5 15 N 2 ] glutamine, [ 15 N 2 ] glutamine, [ 13 C 4 ] fumarate and [ 13 C 2 ] fumarate, 13 C and/or 15 N incorporation into compounds were identified using accurate mass shift of +1.0034 and +0.9970, respectively. [ 13 C 2 ] fumarate contained 13 C atoms at position 2 and 3. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were also control-pulsed with unlabelled reagent to determine effects of natural 13 C abundance (1.1%) and 15 N abundance (0.4%), with levels subtracted from quantified stable isotope incorporation as required. Mass isotopomer (MI) fraction was defined as the peak area of the MI divided by the total peak areas for all MIs expressed as a percentage.
Putative enzymatic function of recombinant human FAMIN (FAMIN 254I ) was investigated against an aqueous HepG2 metabolite library or nucleoside substrates at indicated concentrations and detected using UHPLC-MS as described above. The library consisted of the dried, Folch extracted aqueous phase from 5 × 10 6 cells HepG2 cells 48h after transfection with FAMIN siRNA. Unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends, HEK293T cell-expressed protein was used for all assays. The reaction mixture (final volume 100 μL) consisted of 10 μg of recombinant protein and 10 μM nucleoside substrate in Dulbecco’s PBS (Thermo Fisher), pH 7.4 unless otherwise indicated. For the reverse reaction enzyme assay, 50 μM of adenine and ribose-1-phosphate were used. Protein elution buffer as described above was used as a control. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 h and then quenched with × 5 volume of ice-cold methanol. Samples were centrifuged at 21,000 g for 5 min transferred to fresh tubes and then dried down prior to analysis as described above.
Laccase (benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.2) enzymatic activities of recombinant FAMIN 254I , YfiH and YlmD were tested against the non-phenolic synthetic substrate ABTS [2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as described ( Gorshkov et al., 2017 28. Gorshkov, V. ∙ Tarasova, N. ∙ Gogoleva, N. ... Polyphenol oxidase from Pectobacterium atrosepticum : identification and cloning of gene and characteristics of the enzyme J. Basic Microbiol. 2017; 57 :998-1009 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). 10 μg/mL of laccase from Trametes versicolor (positive control) or an equivalent quantity of purified FAMIN 254I , YfiH or YlmD was used in all assays. The reaction mixture (final volume 100 μL) consisted of 1 mM ABTS, 0.1 mM CuSO 4 and purified protein in Dulbecco’s PBS (Thermo Fisher), pH 7.4. The samples were incubated at 37°C and activity determined by measuring absorbance change at 405 nM. For LC-MS based laccase assays, the reaction mixture (final volume 100 μL) consisted of 10 μg of recombinant protein and 10 μM laccase substrate, sinapic acid or ferulic acid, in Dulbecco’s PBS (Thermo Fisher), pH 7.4 unless otherwise indicated. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 h and then quenched with × 5 volume of ice-cold methanol. Samples were centrifuged at 21,000 g for 5 min, transferred to fresh tubes and then dried down prior to analysis as described above.
Intracellular pH (pH c ) was determined using the fluorogenic cytoplasmic pH indicator probe pHrodo Red AM (Thermo Fisher). M0, M1-polarized BMDMs, and HepG2 cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 20mM HEPES and with pHrodo diluted at 5 μM final concentration. Cells were then washed with HEPES-HBSS and fluorescence measured using a microplate reader (Tecan infinite M1000) with an excitation/emission at 560/585nm. To assess the effects of exogenously supplied fumarate and malate on pH c, M0 and M1-polarized BMDMs were incubated 24 h prior to pHrodo assay with medium supplied with 300 μM fumarate, 300 μM malate or vehicle control. To evaluate the effects of L -alanosine treatment on pH c , HepG2 cells and M1 macrophages were treated 24 h prior to pHrodo assay with 100uM L -alanosine or at the concentration indicated in figure legends in the presence or absence of 300 μM fumarate, 300 μM malate or vehicle control. pH c was alternatively assessed in M1-polarized macrophages using a dual-excitation ratiometric pH indicator, BCECF AM probe (Thermo Fisher). In brief, cells were loaded with 5 μM of BCECF diluted in HBSS and incubated in a non-CO 2 incubator at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with HBSS and signals measured using a microplate reader (Tecan infinite M1000) with dual excitation set at 490 nm and 440 nm and fixed emission at 535 nm.
HepG2 cells were directly plated (7 × 10 3 cells/well) and transfected with specific targeting siRNAs (Dharmacon) for 48 h in XF-96 cell culture plates. BMDMs (7 × 10 4 cells/well) were plated in XF-96 plates and differentiated as described above toward M1 macrophages or left unpolarized and assayed as M0 macrophages. For both BMDMs and HepG2, cells were then washed and incubated for 1 h in XF assay medium (unbuffered DMEM pH 7.4 with 10 mM glucose and 2 mM L-glutamine) in a non-CO 2 incubator at 37°C as per manufacturer’s instructions (Seahorse Agilent). Real time measurements of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were performed using an XF-96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent). Three or more consecutive measurements were obtained under basal conditions and after the sequential addition of 1 μM oligomycin, to inhibit mitochondrial ATP synthase; 1.5 μM FCCP (fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone), a protonophore that uncouples ATP synthesis from oxygen consumption by the electron-transport chain; and 100 nM rotenone plus 1 μM antimycin A, which inhibits the electron transport chain. To assess glycolysis, three or more consecutive ECAR measurements were obtained under basal conditions and after the sequential addition of 1 μM oligomycin, to elicit maximal glycolytic capacity and 100 mM 2-DG (2-deoxyglucose) to inhibit glycolysis. To assess the effects of L -alanosine treatment on OCR and ECAR, cells were exposed to 60 μM (HepG2 cells) or 100 μM (BMDMs) of L -alanosine for 24 h or as indicated in the figure legends prior to Seahorse assay. To assess the effects of SB204990 on OCR and ECAR, M0 macrophages were treated with 5 μM of SB204990 for 3 h followed by Seahorse assay. To evaluate the effects of exogenously supplied fumarate or malate on OCR and ECAR, cells were treated 24 h with 250 μM fumarate or malate (HepG2 cells) or 8 h with 300 μM (M0 macrophages) prior to Seahorse assay. OCR was also assessed via Seahorse assay in Famin p.254I M0 macrophages silenced for Adss , Adsl or for Ampd s (Ampd1, Ampd2 and Ampd3). Gene silencing in those cells was achieved using an electroporation-based transfection method (Amaxa Nucleofection), according to manufacturer’s protocol (Lonza). siRNA of interest was purchased from Dharmacon (Horizon Discovery) and used for nucleofection at final concentration of 300nM.
Gene silencing in HepG2 cells was achieved through lipofection using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher) coupled to an optimized “reverse transfection” protocol for that cell line as per RNAiMAX manufacturer’s protocol ( https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/references/protocols/cell-culture/transfection-protocol/rnaimax-reverse-transfections-lipofectamine.html ). For all experiments using siRNA transfection into HepG2 cells, the targeting siRNA of interest was purchased from Dharmacon (Horizon Discovery) and used at final concentration of 25nM.
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104) with on-column DNase digestion, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, and RNA quantified with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation system. For all samples RNA integrity number was 9.7 or above. Library preparation was performed using the TruSeq stranded mRNA library prep kit (Illumina, 20020594), with 400ng total RNA per sample in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Eleven libraries were sequenced at a time in one lane on an Illumina HiSeq3000 (1x50 base pairs). FastQ files were quality-checked (FastQC; http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ) and any residual adaptor sequences were removed (TrimGalore; http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ ). Reads were then aligned to the reference genome (mm10, UCSC) using HISAT2 ( Kim et al., 2015 36. Kim, D. ∙ Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. HISAT: a fast spliced aligner with low memory requirements Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :357-360 Crossref Scopus (13770) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential gene expression analysis was performed on read count files using the limma package in R with the Voom transformation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed using log counts-per-million (CPM) following batch correction (sva package in R).
The protein sequences were concatenated and aligned with MAFFT v. 7.20 (RRID: SCR_011811 ) and maximum-likelihood trees were constructed using RAxML v. 8.2.8 (RRID: SCR_006086 ) with the standard LG model and 100 rapid bootstrap replicates. Trees were visualized using FastTree followed by iTOL.
Immunoblot analysis was performed as per standard procedures. In brief, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentration was measured using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit and equal amounts of proteins loaded onto SDS polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (5% skimmed milk), followed by incubation overnight with primary antibody. Antibodies were detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using 20 × LumiGLO Reagent (Cell Signaling).
For mitochondrial ROS measurements, macrophages were seeded at 4.5 × 10 4 cells per well in a 96-well half area microplate (Greiner) and polarized as described above. Macrophages were then washed with warm phenol red-free Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS), with CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 . Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 5 μM of the mitochondrial superoxide indicator probe, MitoSox (Invitrogen), diluted in the same wash medium. Fluorescence intensity was measured after washing using a plate reader (TECAN Infinite M1000) with excitation/emission at 510/580nm. To evaluate the effects of exogenously supplied fumarate on mitochondrial ROS, M1 macrophages were treated with 300 μM fumarate for 24 h prior to the assay.
Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the TMRE probe (abcam). Macrophages were seeded at 4.5 × 10 4 cells per well in a 96-well half area microplate (Greiner) and polarized toward M1 as described above. Cells were incubated for 30 min with TMRE at 100 nM diluted in warm culture medium (RPMI). Cells were then washed twice with warm PBS / 0.2% BSA and fluorescence intensity detected using a plate reader with excitation/emission at 549/575 nm. As indicated, cells were incubated with 5 μM FCCP for 15min prior to adding TMRE. For determination of mitochondrial biomass, M1-polarized microphages were incubated for 30 min with 100 nM of MitoTracker Green (Thermo Fisher) diluted in warm phenol-free, serum-free RPMI medium. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a plate reader (TECAN Infinite M1000) with excitation/emission at 490/516 nm.
Proliferation rate of HepG2 cells was determined using the CyQUANT Proliferation Assay (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, cells were transfected and cultured in black polystyrene microplates with a flat clear bottom (Greiner CELLSTAR). At the indicated time points, fluorescence intensity was measured using a plate reader (Infinite M1000 Pro Multi Detection, TECAN) with appropriate wavelength.
Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 7 and 8 or Compound Discoverer (Thermo Scientific) as described in LC-MS analysis methods. Statistical parameters including the statistical test used, exact value of n , what n represents, and measures of distribution and deviation are reported in the figure legends. Unless otherwise stated, statistical significance was calculated as appropriate using unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA with a P value of < 0.05 considered significant and applicable post hoc testing.
