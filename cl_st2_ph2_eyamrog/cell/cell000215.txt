Title: Lactate Elicits ER-Mitochondrial Mg 2+ Dynamics to Integrate Cellular Metabolism


Abstract: Summary

Mg 2+ is the most abundant divalent cation in metazoans and an essential cofactor for ATP, nucleic acids, and countless metabolic enzymes. To understand how the spatio-temporal dynamics of intracellular Mg 2+ ( i Mg 2+ ) are integrated into cellular signaling, we implemented a comprehensive screen to discover regulators of i Mg 2+ dynamics. Lactate emerged as an activator of rapid release of Mg 2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, which facilitates mitochondrial Mg 2+ ( m Mg 2+ ) uptake in multiple cell types. We demonstrate that this process is remarkably temperature sensitive and mediated through intracellular but not extracellular signals. The ER-mitochondrial Mg 2+ dynamics is selectively stimulated by L-lactate. Further, we show that lactate-mediated m Mg 2+ entry is facilitated by Mrs2, and point mutations in the intermembrane space loop limits m Mg 2+ uptake. Intriguingly, suppression of m Mg 2+ surge alleviates inflammation-induced multi-organ failure. Together, these findings reveal that lactate mobilizes i Mg 2+ and links the m Mg 2+ transport machinery with major metabolic feedback circuits and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

Section: Introduction

Mg 2+ is the most abundant and an essential divalent cation among eukaryotes. In metazoan cells, 95% of the intracellular Mg 2+ concentration ([Mg 2+ ] i ; 10–30 mM) is bound with ATP and other molecules ( de Baaij et al., 2015 8. de Baaij, J.H. ∙ Hoenderop, J.G. ∙ Bindels, R.J.

Biophys. 2011; 512 :1-23 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ). The remaining unbound free [Mg 2+ ] i (0.5–1.2 mM) is tightly regulated, yet its effects on biomolecular functions are unknown. Remarkably, this free [Mg 2+ ] i concentration is 100-fold below the electrochemical potential, which theoretically indicates regulated Mg 2+ entry. Similar to Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ is compartmentalized and contributes as a cofactor for enzymes in protein synthesis, ATP production, and chromatin/nucleotide stability. Regulation of [Mg 2+ ] i occurs via numerous Mg 2+ transporting proteins on the plasma membrane, including the ubiquitous TRPM7, MagT1, MMGT1, SLC41A1, and tissue-specific TRPM6, as well as cyclin M2 and cyclin M4 ( Chaigne-Delalande et al., 2013 5.

USA. 2009; 106 :15750-15755 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). While our understanding of cellular Mg 2+ flux has improved over the years, there have been a lack of specific agonists identified for i Mg 2+ dynamics, preventing further assessment of Mg 2+ signaling within and between specific cellular compartments, like the ER and mitochondria. Activation of receptors by a variety of agonists can rapidly generate inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP 3 ), resulting in a steep intracellular Ca 2+ increase ( Berridge et al., 2003 1. Berridge, M.J. ∙ Bootman, M.D. ∙ Roderick, H.L. Calcium signalling: dynamics, homeostasis and remodelling Nat. Rev. Mol.

Calcium signaling Cell. 2007; 131 :1047-1058 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3361) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, metabolic and hormonal stimulation of cells leads to an alteration in [Mg 2+ ] i in a much slower fashion ( Romani and Scarpa, 1990 40. Romani, A. ∙ Scarpa, A. Hormonal control of Mg2+ transport in the heart Nature. 1990; 346 :841-844 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rubin, 1975 41. Rubin, H. Central role for magnesium in coordinate control of metabolism and growth in animal cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72 :3551-3555 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). While it has been suggested that metabolic stimulation promotes Mg 2+ mobilization, it remains unclear whether the elevation in [Mg 2+ ] i originates from intracellular stores or from plasma membrane entry mechanisms. Further, despite its crucial functions, how the spatiotemporal dynamics of i Mg 2+ control signaling systems remains a mystery.
Studies characterizing gain-of-function SNPs in Parkinson disease and nephronophthisis-like phenotypes have revealed members of the solute carrier family of proteins, SLC41A1, SLC41A2, and SLC41A3, to be associated with Mg 2+ transport ( de Baaij et al., 2015 8. de Baaij, J.H. ∙ Hoenderop, J.G. ∙ Bindels, R.J.

Further, mutations in the MagT1 Mg 2+ channel are associated with immunodeficiency syndromes, suggesting an essential role for Mg 2+ flux in T lymphocyte development and activation ( Chaigne-Delalande et al., 2013 5. Chaigne-Delalande, B. ∙ Li, F.Y. ∙ O’Connor, G.M. ...

While these findings have enhanced the knowledge of plasma membrane Mg 2+ influx mechanisms, the i Mg 2+ transport systems are still not fully characterized. Originally, mitochondrial RNA splicing 2 (Mrs2) was considered to be the primary Mg 2+ transporter in yeast mitochondria ( Bui et al., 1999 3. Bui, D.M. ∙ Gregan, J. ∙ Jarosch, E. ...

A mutation in the gene encoding mitochondrial Mg 2 + channel MRS2 results in demyelination in the rat PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 :e1001262 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the physiologic relevance of this observation in higher-order systems remains to be determined. Identification of small ligand-like activator molecules would aid in our understanding of i Mg 2+ dynamics and the cause-effect relationships that exist between i Mg 2+ flux and cellular processes.
Here, we conducted a targeted screen of cellular metabolites to identify modulators of i Mg 2+ dynamics. We discovered the glycolytic end-product lactate as a ligand for ER Mg 2+ release and subsequent m Mg 2+ uptake. Lactate-mediated m Mg 2+ uptake is both dose-dependent and temperature-sensitive and mediated through intracellular rather than extracellular signals. We show that lactate mediated m Mg 2+ entry is facilitated by Mrs2 in a ΔΨ m -dependent fashion. These findings together reveal that lactate acts as a ligand that activates i Mg 2+ dynamics and establishes a link between Mrs2 with major metabolic feedback circuits and bioenergetics.

Section: Results

The significance of Mg 2+ to physiology was first appreciated ∼100 years ago when this cation was identified in blood plasma by W.G. Denis. Mg 2+ was demonstrated to be necessary for mouse viability by J. Leroy, and a Mg 2+ deficiency in humans was reported by A. Hirschfelder and V. Haury ( de Baaij et al., 2015 8. de Baaij, J.H. ∙ Hoenderop, J.G. ∙ Bindels, R.J. Magnesium in man: implications for health and disease Physiol. Rev. 2015; 95 :1-46 Crossref Scopus (1087) PubMed Google Scholar ). Today, Mg 2+ has been implicated and targeted in several clinical conditions, including migraines, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and preeclampsia ( de Baaij et al., 2015 8. de Baaij, J.H. ∙ Hoenderop, J.G. ∙ Bindels, R.J. Magnesium in man: implications for health and disease Physiol. Rev. 2015; 95 :1-46 Crossref Scopus (1087) PubMed Google Scholar ), for example. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms underlying i Mg 2+ dynamics have largely remained a mystery due to the absence of strong intercompartmental concentration gradients, lack of sensitive Mg 2+ probes, and, most critically, the nonidentification of ligand(s) mobilizing i Mg 2+ ( Murphy, 2000 34. Murphy, E. Mysteries of magnesium homeostasis Circ. Res. 2000; 86 :245-248 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since Mg 2+ modulates the metabolic state of the cell through regulation of glycolytic enzymes, mitochondrial dehydrogenases, and ATP synthase, yet the metabolic state of the cell regulates the concentration of cytosolic and m Mg 2+ , we here screened several endogenous metabolites involved in cellular energy production as potential ligands that mobilize i Mg 2+ .
To identify a ligand/activator of i Mg 2+ dynamics, we utilized the cell permeant [Mg 2+ ] i indicator, Mag Green-AM, in a live cell confocal fluorescence screen. First, we tested whether GPCR agonist-induced second messengers promoted i Mg 2+ dynamics. To discriminate between intracellular Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ dynamics, HeLa cells were loaded with the cell permeant Ca 2+ indicator, Fluo-4-AM or Mag Green-AM, followed by stimulation with the GPCR agonist, histamine (100 μM). As expected, histamine rapidly elicited cytosolic Ca 2+ ( c Ca 2+ ) mobilization, while i Mg 2+ dynamics were absent ( Figures S1 A–S1D). These data indicate that GPCR-derived IP 3 is not an activator of i Mg 2+ dynamics.
Suppression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and increased glycolysis have been linked to intense exercise, sepsis, ischemia, neoplasia, and mitochondrial diseases. To continue the search for i Mg 2+ modulators, we next assessed glycolytic and OXPHOS metabolites, metabolic substrates, and nucleotides. Primary murine hepatocytes were loaded with Mag Green-AM and stimulated with major cellular metabolites to monitor i Mg 2+ dynamics. Intriguingly, only the aerobic/anerobic glycolytic end-product lactate consistently exhibited a rapid and robust depletion of ER Mag-Green signal followed by a subsequent elevation in the mitochondria ( Figures 1 A and 1B). To exclude the possibility that acidification of the medium by lactate could alter membrane polarization, we normalized the pH and achieved similar results, indicating that the lactate anion is the likely ligand/activator of i Mg 2+ flux. Similarly, stimulation of hepatocytes with acetic acid or butyric acid did not induce ER Mg 2+ release or m Mg 2+ uptake ( Figures 1 A and 1B), reinforcing a pH-independent effect. Simultaneously loading hepatocytes with the mitochondrial marker Mito-tracker Red and Mag-Green-AM confirmed that Mag-Green signals were measured from the mitochondria ( Figures 1 A–1C). Both sodium L-lactate and L-lactic acid (5 mM) triggered a rapid depletion of ER Mg 2+ with concomitant nuclear accumulation, followed by mitochondrial elevation of Mag Green signal with a lag time of ∼25 s ( Figures 1 D). The Mg 2+ changes observed in the ER and mitochondria upon stimulation with L-lactic acid were clearly reciprocal ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and 1D). We also observed lactate-specific robust uptake of Mg 2+ into mitochondria following ER depletion in three additional cell types tested (HepG2, MEFs, and COS-7) ( Figures S1 E–S1H).
Notably, pyruvate, glucose, palmitate, nucleotides, and other TCA intermediates did not induce m Mg 2+ uptake ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Low (5 mM) or high (25 mM) glucose did not induce i Mg 2+ dynamics ( Figures 1 A–1C, Figures S1 E–S1H and Table S1 ). Addition of citrate (5 mM), a known chelator of free Mg 2+ , quenched both the mitochondrial and ER Mg 2+ signals ( Figures 1 B and 1E), as expected. Since lactate/pyruvate ratio alters NADH levels and alanine can behave similar to lactate, we tested whether alanine (5 mM) and NADH (120 μM) induce i Mg 2+ dynamics. These two metabolites did not stimulate i Mg 2+ dynamics ( Figure S1 I). Next, we tested whether clamping the redox state would alter lactate-induced i Mg 2+ dynamics. Hepatocytes were bathed in 7 mM pyruvate before L-lactate stimulation. The pyruvate supplementation did not affect lactate-induced i Mg 2+ dynamics, suggesting that lactate exerts an allosteric effect ( Figure S1 J).
We also tested whether lactate stimulates intracellular Ca 2+ ( i Ca 2+ ) release. Cells were loaded with the c Ca 2+ indicator, (Fluo-4), and stimulated with either glucose or lactate. Cells stimulated with glucose, but not lactate, elicited c Ca 2+ elevation, suggesting that lactate exclusively induces i Mg 2+ dynamics ( Figure S1 K). Taken together, these data indicate that lactate rapidly mobilizes ER Mg 2+ stores, resulting in m Mg 2+ uptake in multiple cell types.
Although mammalian cells predominantly produce L-lactate, D-lactate is the major product generated by bacteria ( Brooks, 2018 2. Brooks, G.A. The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :757-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, the ER depletion and m Mg 2+ uptake was observed only with L-lactate stimulation and not D-lactate in primary hepatocytes ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Additionally, we assessed other lactate analogs such as methyl L/D-lactate enantiomers and 3-phenyllactic acid using our hepatocyte system ( Figure 2 A). The i Mg 2+ mobilization was not observed with the methyl-lactate analogs, regardless of stereochemistry; however, a partial ER depletion followed by nominal m Mg 2+ uptake was induced by 3-phenyllactic acid ( Figure 2 B). Rather than a non-selective cell permeability, plasma membrane monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) facilitate cellular entry of lactate. To assess the cellular entry of lactate and analogs, murine hepatocytes were loaded with an intracellular pH indicator (ratiometric BCECF-AM), and cytosolic pH changes were monitored. Both D-lactate and L-lactate rapidly changed the intracellular pH ( Figure S2 G). We also noticed that methyl L-lactate and 3-phenyllactic acid affected the intracellular pH ( Figure S2 G). Thus, L-lactate and the associated analogs are readily taken up by hepatocytes.
Since the observed i Mg 2+ dynamics are highly specific to L-lactate, we next assessed whether lactate functions as an upstream messenger or a ligand for ER Mg 2+ release using a permeabilized cell system, which dissociates plasma membrane signaling from the ER. This permeabilized cell system also separates the ER from mitochondria. Following addition of 5 mM L-lactate but not D-lactate, the ER Mag-Green signal rapidly decreased, indicative of direct L-lactate-induced ER Mg 2+ release ( Figure 2 C). Thus, the natural L-form of lactate found in mammals is likely a bona fide and direct activator of i Mg 2+ dynamics.
Given the large physiologic and pathophysiologic range of lactate accumulation in the extracellular fluid (i.e., ∼0.5–30 mM) ( Brooks, 2018 2. Brooks, G.A. The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :757-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ; Haas et al., 2016 14.

Sci. 2016; 41 :460-471 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pavlova and Thompson, 2016 36. Pavlova, N.N. ∙ Thompson, C.B. The Emerging Hallmarks of Cancer Metabolism Cell Metab. 2016; 23 :27-47 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3821) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next evaluated the lactate concentration required to trigger ER Mg 2+ depletion and uptake by the mitochondria. Lactate concentrations > 2 mM induced ER depletion and partial uptake of Mg 2+ into the mitochondria at 37 ο C ( Figures 2 D and 2E). However, a consistent, maximal response was observed with 5 mM lactate ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Serendipitously, we noticed that lactate-induced depletion of ER Mag-Green signal occurred at both 37 ο C and room temperature (25 ο C) ( Figure 2 F). In contrast, the mitochondrial Mag-Green signal was undetectable at 25 ο C, indicating that the m Mg 2+ entry machinery was temperature sensitive ( Figure 2 G). Consequently, we repeated the experiment at a range of temperatures (i.e., 25°C–40°C) with 5 mM lactate. Similar lactate-mediated ER Mag-Green signal depletion was seen at all temperatures ( Figure 2 H). Remarkably, lactate-induced m Mg 2+ uptake was found to occur maximally at 37°C with less uptake at 34°C and 40°C. ( Figure 2 I), confirming that the m Mg 2+ uptake machinery has temperature-sensitive properties.
We next asked whether temperature sensitivity is a distinctive property of the m Mg 2+ uptake machinery by measuring MCU-mediated Ca 2+ uptake at 25°C and 37°C. HepG2 cells transduced with mitochondrial Ca 2+ sensor (GCaMP6s-mt) were stimulated with 2.5 μM ionomycin, and MCU-mediated Ca 2+ uptake was measured. m Ca 2+ uptake was comparable at both temperatures ( Figure S2 A). We further demonstrated that MCU has negligible temperature sensitivity at 25°C and 37°C using a permeabilized cell system ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Collectively, these findings suggest that the activity of the m Mg 2+ uptake machinery but not MCU is sensitive to near physiological temperature changes.
We next assessed whether m Mg 2+ uptake is dependent upon the highly electronegative membrane potential (ΔΨ m ) of the mitochondria. After a baseline recording, the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (10 μM) was applied to hepatocytes simultaneously loaded with Mag Green and the ΔΨ m indicator TMRE. As expected, FCCP dissipated the ΔΨ m as evidenced by loss of the TMRE signal, though the ER and mitochondrial Mag-Green signal intensities remained unchanged ( Figures S2 D and S2E). Subsequent stimulation with a 5 mM bolus of L-lactate resulted in the characteristic depletion of ER Mg 2+ ( Figure S2 F); however, loss of the ΔΨ m abrogated m Mg 2+ elevation( Figure S2 E). Thus, the machinery involved in lactate mediated m Mg 2+ uptake is both temperature and ΔΨ m dependent.
Most mammalian cells utilize monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1-4) for plasma membrane lactate entry ( Brooks, 2018 2. Brooks, G.A. The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :757-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether MCTs play a role in the i Mg 2+ dynamics, hepatocytes were pretreated with MCT1 (SR13800; 1 μM) or MCT1/2 (AR-C155858; 2 μM) inhibitors for 60 min before stimulation. Remarkably, both inhibitors suppressed lactate-induced Mg 2+ depletion from the ER and m Mg 2+ uptake ( Figures 3 A and 3B, left panels). The MCT1 inhibitor only partially reduced ER Mag-Green signal, but blockade of both MCT1 and 2 transporters robustly suppressed the lactate effect ( Figure 3 A, and 3B, left panels). Lactate stimulation in Mg 2+ -free buffer still elicited a decrease in the ER Mag-Green signal, but the response was slightly reduced ( Figure 3 A, right panel). Importantly, a significant m Mg 2+ uptake was observed after stimulation in Mg 2+ -free buffer, indicating lactate-mediated mobilization from i Mg 2+ stores rather than extracellular Mg 2+ influx ( Figure 3 B, right panel).
Consistent with our pharmacological approach, siRNA-mediated knockdown of MCT1 significantly reduced both ER and m Mg 2+ dynamics, underscoring that lactate transport-induced depletion of ER Mg 2+ is the principal source for m Mg 2+ uptake ( Figures 3 C–3E). Further, we found that exogenous lactate elicited a rapid ER Mg 2+ depletion and m Mg 2+ uptake even in the presence of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor GSK2837808A ( Figure S6 K), reinforcing the direct effect of lactate rather any derivative.
Having established that lactate-induced ER Mg 2+ store depletion is the source for m Mg 2+ uptake, we used permeabilized cells to probe for direct lactate effects on m Mg 2+ uptake. Digitonin permeabilized cells (∼2.5 × 10 6 ) were challenged with 5 mM lactate, 1 mM Mg 2+ , or a combination of both. Cells treated with lactate alone exhibited a nominal rise of Mg 2+ in the extramitochondrial medium as measured by changes in Mag-Green signal ( Figure 3 F). Cells exposed to 1 mM Mg 2+ alone rapidly cleared the extramitochondrial Mg 2+ , indicating robust m Mg 2+ uptake in the absence of lactate. The combination of lactate and Mg 2+ did not further enhance m Mg 2+ uptake rates ( Figure 3 F). We also examined the optimal extramitochondrial [Mg 2+ ] required for m Mg 2+ uptake by delivering 0.25–2.0 mM pulses of Mg 2+ . We observed maximal uptake rates at 1 mM Mg 2+ and reduced rates at 2 mM Mg 2+ , indicating a m Mg 2+ uptake feedback inhibition ( Figure 3 G).
Human Mrs2 is a homolog to yeast Mrs2p, which is a selective m Mg 2+ channel. To gain mechanistic insight into the basis for the feedback inhibition, we cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli , and purified the human Mrs2 N-terminal matrix domain (residues 58–333), comprising ∼70% of the molecule and a key regulatory domain ( Figure 3 H, inset) ( Pfoh et al., 2012 38. Pfoh, R. ∙ Li, A. ∙ Chakrabarti, N. ... Structural asymmetry in the magnesium channel CorA points to sequential allosteric regulation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :18809-18814 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the domain exhibited two distinct minima at ∼208 and 222 nm, indicative of high levels of α-helix and consistent with yeast Mrs2p and bacterial CorA (lower ortholog) crystal structures ( Figure 3 H) ( Eshaghi et al., 2006 10. Eshaghi, S. ∙ Niegowski, D. ∙ Kohl, A. ...

Crystal structure of the CorA Mg2+ transporter Nature. 2006; 440 :833-837 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CD spectrum was not significantly different in the presence of 5 mM Mg 2+ . We also evaluated the thermal stability by monitoring the change in CD ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature. The protein exhibited a high cooperativity of unfolding and midpoint of temperature denaturation (T m ) of ∼53.8°C, consistent with a folded tertiary conformation. Addition of 5 mM Mg 2+ increased the T m by ∼3.4°C, suggesting stabilizing interactions with Mg 2+ ( Figure 3 I). Mg 2+ binding to the N-terminal domain of CorA maintains a closed state by promoting inter-N-terminal domain interactions ( Pfoh et al., 2012 38. Pfoh, R. ∙ Li, A. ∙ Chakrabarti, N. ... Structural asymmetry in the magnesium channel CorA points to sequential allosteric regulation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :18809-18814 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data indicate that human Mrs2 also harbors a Mg 2+ -sensitive N-terminal domain, which could underlie feedback inhibition by binding matrix Mg 2+ , like CorA.
Having established that lactate elicits m Mg 2+ uptake secondary to rapid and robust ER Mg 2+ depletion, we next tested whether Mrs2 is the bona fide channel responsible for m Mg 2+ uptake in our system. We generated a global Mrs2 knockout mouse model via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to introduce a premature stop codon and BamH1 cut site. Founder mice were examined for ssODN incorporation by PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestion ( Figure 4 A). After verifying germline transmission and breeding to heterozygosity, DNA was isolated and sequenced to confirm the in-frame point mutations ( Figure 4 B). After 10 generations of breeding, Mrs2 deletion was confirmed by RT-qPCR ( Figure 4 C). We did not obtain the expected Mendelian ratios of Mrs2 +/+ , Mrs2 +/− , and Mrs2 −/− pups after splitting and fostering litters born to Mrs2 +/− intercrosses ( Table S2 ). After generation and validation of the global murine Mrs2 KO, murine WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes were loaded with Mag-Green and stimulated with lactate. Lactate stimulated significant depletion of ER Mg 2+ in both the WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes; moreover, the dose-dependent effects of lactate were not different in the WT compared to Mrs2 KO ( Figure S3 A). Conversely, lactate-induced m Mg 2+ uptake was ablated in Mrs2 KO but remained intact in WT hepatocytes ( Figure S3 B).
Although compartmentalized Mag-Green displays robust dynamic changes in the ER and mitochondria upon lactate stimulation, Mg 2+ flux was also monitored using a genetically encoded Mg 2+ sensor, Mag-FRET ( Lindenburg et al., 2013 26. Lindenburg, L.H. ∙ Vinkenborg, J.L. ∙ Oortwijn, J. ... MagFRET: the first genetically encoded fluorescent Mg2+ sensor PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e82009 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). We designed and generated two separate Mag-FRET constructs fused with either the ER retention sequence (KDEL) or the mitochondria targeting sequence from pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-1 ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Primary murine hepatocytes were transduced with Adenoviral (AdV5a) versions of these Mag-FRET sensors. 36 h post-transduction, we measured the Mag-FRET signals after stimulation with 5 mM lactate ( Figure 4 F; Figures S3 C and S3D). The mitochondrial Mag-FRET signal rapidly increased following stimulation in the WT but was almost completely absent in Mrs2 KO hepatocytes ( Figure 4 F). As controls, we confirmed proper mitochondrial ΔΨ m and localization of the ER Mag-FRET sensor in hepatocytes ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Although m Mg 2+ uptake was absent in Mrs2 KO, the ER Mag-FRET signal was significantly depleted following stimulation with lactate in both hepatocytes ( Figures 4 I and 4J). These data suggest that Mrs2 is, indeed, the molecular entity responsible for the m Mg 2+ conductance after lactate-induced ER Mg 2+ depletion.
Primary structure alignment of Mrs2 channels from yeast to higher eukaryotes highlights conservation of two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2), negatively charged amino acids in the intermembrane space loop linking TM1 and TM2 and a F/Y-G-M-N motif ( Figure 5 A). Single amino acid substitutions in the G-M-N motif are sufficient to abolish the selectivity of Mg 2+ transport ( Eshaghi et al., 2006 10. Eshaghi, S. ∙ Niegowski, D. ∙ Kohl, A. ...

Mrs2p forms a high conductance Mg2+ selective channel in mitochondria Biophys. J. 2007; 93 :3872-3883 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we next sought to determine whether conserved residues within the putative intermembrane space loop of Mrs2 are required for lactate-mediated m Mg 2+ uptake. We generated Adenoviral (AdV5A) Mrs2 WT and mutant constructs ([GMNLESSLEED] to [IKLLKSSLKKK]) tagged with mRFP/Flag to analyze the protein expression, localization, and impact on m Mg 2+ uptake ( Figure 5 B). Ectopic protein expression of WT and mutant Mrs2 in transduced primary murine hepatocytes was confirmed by western blot ( Figure 5 C). Additionally, confocal microscopy revealed that WT and mutant Mrs2 proteins were properly localized to the mitochondria ( Figure 5 D). Next, we co-transduced WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes with the Mag-FRET sensors and WT or mutant Mrs2 constructs. WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes exhibited comparable ER Mag-FRET SE signal depletion upon lactate stimulation when expressing either WT or mutant Mrs2 ( Figure 5 E). Additionally, WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes expressing the WT Mrs2 construct showed significant increases in mitochondrial Mag-FRET SE signals following lactate stimulation, though the increase in signal from Mrs2 KO was lower than WT mitochondria. Strikingly, the mitochondrial Mag-FRET SE signal was largely abolished in both cell types expressing the Mrs2 mutant construct. ( Figure 5 F). We also confirmed the ability of Mrs2 to enhance m Mg 2+ uptake by overexpressing the WT Mrs2 viral construct in WT primary hepatocytes and monitoring Mag Green signals after lactate stimulation. Indeed, Mrs2 overexpression potentiated m Mg 2+ uptake without altering lactate-induced ER depletion ( Figures S4 A–S4C). Collectively, these results indicate that Mrs2 is the major route for m Mg 2+ uptake after lactate stimulation.
We next sought to determine whether the m Mg 2+ uptake functional defect in Mrs2 KO cells impacts MCU. WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes permeabilized with digitonin were given a bolus of Ca 2+ (10 μM) at 400 s followed by FCCP exposure at 700 s. The ΔΨ m built similarly in WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes, and the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake rates were comparable ( Figure S5 A). We also transduced WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes with GCaMP6s-mt, a m Ca 2+ sensor. Mrs2 deletion did not alter ionomycin or high glucose-induced m Ca 2+ uptake, indicating that Mrs2 is impermeable to Ca 2+ ( Figures S5 B and S5C). Reciprocally, we also tested whether deletion of MCU could alter m Mg 2+ uptake. MCU fl/fl and MCU KO hepatocytes (ΔHep) were imaged for m Mg 2+ uptake using Mag-Green. Lactate-induced ER depletion and m Mg 2+ uptake were not affected by MCU deletion ( Figures S5 D and S5E). These results reinforce that lactate is a specific activator of Mrs2-mediated m Mg 2+ , which functions independent of MCU activity.
Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ions exert major regulatory effects on cellular metabolism. For example, the activity of the PDH complex is controlled by divalent cations through ion-dependent modulation of its phosphorylation status ( Glancy and Balaban, 2012 13. Glancy, B. ∙ Balaban, R.S. Role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in the regulation of cellular energetics Biochemistry. 2012; 51 :2959-2973 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ; Midgley et al., 1987 31. Midgley, P.J. ∙ Rutter, G.A. ∙ Thomas, A.P. ... Effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase within toluene-permeabilized mitochondria Biochem. J. 1987; 241 :371-377 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, the inactive form of PDH complex (phosphorylated) is enhanced by Mg 2+ . To assess the effects of Mrs2 deletion on cellular metabolism, we first measured basal mitochondrial matrix [Mg 2+ ]. Permeabilized cells were exposed to FCCP, and the released m Mg 2+ was taken as resting matrix [Mg 2+ ]. Strikingly, the m [Mg 2+ ] was significantly reduced in Mrs2 KO hepatocytes, strongly corroborating Mrs2 as the major route for m Mg 2+ uptake ( Figures 6 A and 6B).
We next assessed whether mitochondrial changes could be visualized that indicate altered metabolism. Hepatocytes were isolated from WT and Mrs2 KO mice and stained with the fluorescent lipid neutral dye BODIPY 488 as well as the ΔΨ m indicator TMRE. As compared to WT, a similar number of lipid droplets were present after 24 h for Mrs2 KO. No change was observed in ΔΨ m , as assessed by TMRE staining. After 48 h, however, Mrs2 KO cells had significantly more lipid droplets that were smaller in size, indicating that these cells may be more metabolically active than WT ( Figures S6 A and S6B). We also found that Mrs2 KO hepatocytes had significantly lower mitochondrial ROS signal than WT hepatocytes ( Figures S6 C and S6D). To gain a better understanding of the mitochondrial phenotypic differences that exist between the WT and Mrs2 KO cells, ultrastructural imaging was conducted by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mrs2 KO hepatocytes contained significantly longer, more filamentous mitochondria than WT ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Additionally, Mrs2 KO hepatocytes were observed to have significantly increased numbers of mitochondria ( Figures 6 C and 6E).
To further evaluate bioenergetics, we next measured the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in Mrs2 KO and WT hepatocytes. Mrs2 KO hepatocytes exhibited heightened states of basal and maximal OCR compared to WT ( Figure 6 G). The OXPHOS complex protein abundance were relatively unchanged between WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes ( Figure 6 F), ruling out OXPHOS protein abundancy as an underlying factor. Given that increased m Mg 2+ flux induced by lactate might alter OCR, we next delivered lactate to both WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes before the sequential additions of respiratory chain inhibitors. Challenging WT hepatocytes with lactate led to a significant reduction of basal and maximal OCR ( Figure S6 E). In contrast, Mrs2 KO hepatocytes exhibited a marked rise in maximal OCR. These findings suggest that lactate enhances m Mg 2+ uptake and modulates mitochondrial respiration in WT hepatocytes ( Figure 6 H).
Given that ∼95% of cellular Mg 2+ is bound or sequestered by proteins and metabolites such as ATP or citrate, we asked whether depletion of cellular ATP enhances m Mg 2+ uptake ( Corkey et al., 1986 7. Corkey, B.E. ∙ Duszynski, J. ∙ Rich, T.L. ... Regulation of free and bound magnesium in rat hepatocytes and isolated mitochondria J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261 :2567-2574 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mag-Green and mito-Tracker Red loaded hepatocytes were challenged with a combination of oligomycin (20 μM) and 2-deoxy D-glucose (2 mM) to inhibit mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production, respectively. The combination treatment (oligo+2DG) induced non-synchronous mito-Tracker Red oscillations, which were absent in control hepatocytes ( Figures S6 G and S6H, top traces). Concomitantly, we found that the m Mg 2+ rapidly increased ( Figures S6 G and S6H, bottom traces, and Figure S6 I), indicative of ATP depletion and cytosolic Mg 2+ elevation. This data indicates that the elevation of free Mg 2+ dampens bioenergetics, likely through m Mg 2+ -dependent inhibition of OXPHOS.
Intracellular elevation of lactate has been associated with several clinical conditions such as sepsis, ischemia, mitochondrial diseases, and malignancy ( Brooks, 2018 2. Brooks, G.A.

Pavlova, N.N. ∙ Thompson, C.B. The Emerging Hallmarks of Cancer Metabolism Cell Metab. 2016; 23 :27-47 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3821) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that lactate stimulation suppresses OCR, we hypothesized that modulation of mitochondrial Mg 2+ by lactate would affect pyruvate oxidation. Thus, we examined mitochondrial OCR in HepG2 cells after treatment with various doses of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as 5 mM lactate for 8 h. Similar to the lactate effect, cells exposed to LPS had significantly suppressed OCRs ( Figure 6 I and Figure S6 E). We next tested whether the inhibition of OCR by LPS is due to lactate-mediated ER Mg 2+ release and m Mg 2+ uptake. Hepatocytes were pretreated with LDH inhibitors (GSK; 100 nM or Oxamate; 20 mM) prior to LPS challenge. These inhibitors significantly restored both basal as well as maximal OCR, reinforcing the lactate-mediated m Mg 2+ uptake and suppression of OCR ( Figure 6 I and see Figures 7 D and 7E).
To further evaluate how i Mg 2+ impacts OCR, hepatocytes were challenged with various concentrations of exogenous MgCl 2 (1, 2, or 6 mM). Hepatocytes exposed to 2 or 6 mM MgCl 2 exhibited reduced basal and maximal OCR, indicating that the entry mechanism is operative at supraphysiological concentrations of extracellular Mg 2+ ( Figure S6 F). However, exogenous lactate-mediated suppression of OCR was found to be Mrs2 dependent using Mrs2 KO cells ( Figures 6 G and 6H), indicating that lactate mediated ER Mg 2+ release followed by m Mg 2+ uptake is the primary route for the marked suppression of OCR.
Given that the PDH complex is the major link between the glycolytic pathway and the TCA cycle, we also examined whether LPS-induced intracellular lactate production modulates the phosphorylation status of PDH in hepatocytes. WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes were treated with three different doses of LPS for 24 h, and p PDH levels were determined by western blot analysis. When WT hepatocytes were treated with LPS at 10 and 100 μg/mL, a significant amount of phosphorylated S293 PDH was detected ( Figure 6 J, top panel). Remarkably, the LPS-mediated phosphorylation of PDH in Mrs2 KO hepatocytes was almost completely absent ( Figure 6 J, bottom panel). Since multiple phosphorylation sites contribute to PDH complex activity, we also assessed the status of S232 and S300. The S232 and S300 were unaffected upon LPS stimulation in WT hepatocytes, indicating that the LPS-mediated cascade targets uniquely S293 ( Figure S7 A, top panel, and Figure 6 J). In contrast, LPS-mediated phosphorylation was completely blunted, and rather hyper dephosphorylation was observed at the S232 and S300 sites of PDH in the Mrs2 KO hepatocytes, suggesting that lowering m Mg 2+ enhances PDH dephosphorylation upon LPS challenge ( Figure S7 A, bottom panel).
We next tested whether phosphorylation of PDH by LPS is contributed through an HIF1α-dependent mechanism. We found HIF1α stabilization in both WT as well as Mrs2 KO hepatocytes after LPS challenge, and the HIF1α protein abundance was higher in Mrs2 KO hepatocytes ( Figure S7 B). Collectively, these results reveal that lowering mitochondrial matrix [Mg 2+ ] promotes PDH dephosphorylation, which likely enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics (i.e., OCR) ( Figures 6 G and 6H).
To investigate whether lactate-mediated m Mg 2+ flux alters organ function, we chose an LPS-induced acute inflammation model. Both WT and Mrs2 KO hepatocytes exposed to LPS showed higher lactate accumulation ( Figure 7 A). We next examined the m Mg 2+ levels under control and LPS-treated conditions and found increased Mag-Green signals within the mitochondria upon LPS treatment ( Figure 7 B). Although LPS-induced lactate production was comparable between WT and Mrs2 KO, m Mg 2+ was significantly elevated in WT but not in Mrs2 KO ( Figure 7 B). We next asked whether targeting lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) would reduce m Mg 2+ uptake in response to LPS treatment. To test our hypothesis, we pretreated hepatocytes with oxamate (20 mM) overnight before LPS stimulation ( Gandhirajan et al., 2013 12. Gandhirajan, R.K. ∙ Meng, S. ∙ Chandramoorthy, H.C. ... Blockade of NOX2 and STIM1 signaling limits lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular inflammation J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :887-902 PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2019b 50. Zhang, W. ∙ Wang, G. ∙ Xu, Z.G. ... Lactate Is a Natural Suppressor of RLR Signaling by Targeting MAVS Cell. 2019; 178 :176-189.e115 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oxamate pretreatment markedly reduced lactate accumulation and m Mg 2+ uptake, suggesting that lactate is the elicitor of i Mg 2+ dynamics ( Figures 7 C and 7D and Figure S7 H). We next asked whether inhibition of lactate efflux by MCT inhibitors potentiates ER Mg 2+ depletion, indeed finding that lactate accumulation promotes ER Mg 2+ depletion ( Figure S6 J). Lactate effect on i Mg 2+ dynamics was further confirmed using a selective LDH inhibitor, GSK283378080A (100 nM) ( Figure 7 E). Conversely, LDH inhibition by GSK283378080A did not affect exogenous lactate-induced ER Mg 2+ depletion ( Figure S6 K).
Since lactate elicits i Mg 2+ dynamics, we measured basal plasma glucose and lactate levels in Mrs2 KO mice and found that Mrs2 KO mice have lower lactate levels ( Figures 7 F and 7G). One of the major changes that occur during multi-organ-failure (MOF) in severe sepsis is mitochondrial dysfunction. To establish the role of m Mg 2+ flux in LPS-mediated mitochondrial reprogramming and MOF, mice were challenged with LPS (5 mg/kg) for 24 h, and leukocyte infiltration was assessed. Lung sections were stained with neutrophil marker Lys6B, and quantification showed that neutrophil infiltration was significantly suppressed in Mrs2 KO mice challenged with LPS as compared WT mice ( Figures 7 H and 7I). Reciprocally, the assessment of alveolar space diameter revealed a pulmonary edema-like phenotype in WT but was markedly reduced in Mrs2 KO mice ( Figure 7 J). Additionally, we found that Mrs2 KO mice challenged with LPS maintained their body temperature, as compared to WT, in which body temperature dropped ( Figure 7 K). As expected, WT mice challenged with LPS showed higher plasma lactate levels when compared to control ( Figure 7 L), while Mrs2 KO exhibited lower lactate levels ( Figure 7 L).
Consistent with these outcomes, proinflammatory cytokine profiles were attenuated in Mrs2 KO mice challenged with LPS ( Figure 7 M). Having observed a reduced cytokine expression profiles in Mrs2 KO mice following LPS challenge, we asked whether the immune response is altered under basal conditions. Splenocytes were isolated from WT and Mrs2 KO mice for CD3/CD28 co-stimulation to assess c Ca 2+ dynamics. We found that both cell types showed similar c Ca 2+ dynamics ( Figures S7 C–S7E), indicating similar T cell receptor (TCR) crosslinking and exhibiting similar NFAT nuclear translocation ( Figures S7 F and S7G). Since sepsis-related acute inflammation can result in acute kidney injury (AKI), we next assessed whether lowering m Mg 2+ may provide protection against AKI in an LPS-induced model of septic shock. Mrs2 KO mice exhibited lower creatinine and BUN, likely linked to Mg 2+ -dependent control of kidney function ( Figures 7 N and 7O). Collectively, these data suggest that lactate accumulation controls i Mg 2+ dynamics that coordinate mitochondrial metabolism and organ preservation during acute inflammation ( Figure 7 P).

Section: Discussion

In this work, we have taken on the challenge of identifying a highly specific ligand-based driver of i Mg 2+ dynamics that results in rapid and robust Mg 2+ accumulation within mitochondria. We showed that the glycolytic end-product lactate was directly responsible for rapid depletion of ER Mg 2+ stores, followed by robust m Mg 2+ uptake. Our findings reveal that L-lactate-induced i Mg 2+ dynamics are also dependent on a steep ΔΨ m for m Mg 2+ uptake. This phenomenon demonstrated enantiomeric specificity and was not dependent upon pH. Our identification of lactate as a ligand for i Mg 2+ dynamics is remarkably analogous to the IP 3 -mediated depletion of ER Ca 2+ . Therefore, we conclude that the L-lactate anion acts as a signaling molecule that drives i Mg 2+ flux in a highly conserved phenomenon among mammalian cells.
The roles of lactic acid, lactate anions, and hydrogen ions on physiology in settings of muscle fatigue, lactic acidosis, lactatemia, and anaerobiosis have been debated for over a century ( Brooks, 2018 2. Brooks, G.A. The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :757-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ). For instance, it remains uncertain whether glycolysis produces lactate or lactic acid. Nevertheless, it is certain that acidosis occurs in exercise and other conditions ( Brooks, 2018 2. Brooks, G.A. The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :757-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we tested both L-lactic acid and sodium L-lactate in our targeted screen and found both induced m Mg 2+ elevation, demonstrating a powerful ligand effect on ER Mg 2+ release ( Figures 1 A, 2 A, and 2B). Because of the elevation of extracellular lactate noted in intermediary metabolism and exercise performance ( Brooks, 2018 2. Brooks, G.A. The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :757-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ), we questioned whether lactate could function as a ligand for plasma membrane receptors like GPR81 ( Cai et al., 2008 4. Cai, T.Q. ∙ Ren, N. ∙ Jin, L. ... Role of GPR81 in lactate-mediated reduction of adipose lipolysis Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377 :987-991 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2001 23. Lee, D.K. ∙ Nguyen, T. ∙ Lynch, K.R. ... Discovery and mapping of ten novel G protein-coupled receptor genes Gene. 2001; 275 :83-91 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, we blocked lactate influx pharmacologically as well as by RNAi-mediated silencing, revealing that lactate serves as a ligand for ER Mg 2+ release rather than cell surface Mg 2+ entry ( Figure 3 ). Thus, another important fundamental feature of lactate is its activity as an intracellular ligand.
Although over 95% of i Mg 2+ is bound to ATP, polyphosphates, and metabolic enzymes, it was unclear whether dissociation of bound cytosolic Mg 2+ in turn triggers m Mg 2+ uptake. Our fluorescent dye and protein FRET based assays show that ATP hydrolysis does not cause this effect, but rather, m Mg 2+ uptake upon lactate stimulation is from ER Mg 2+ release ( Figures 1 and 4 ). Thus, the ER may contain a primary intracellular pool of free Mg 2+ that is rapidly released in response to a stimulus like lactate ( Figures 1 and 4 ). This phenomenon is analogous to IP 3 -induced ER Ca 2+ release and subsequent MCU-mediated m Ca 2+ uptake ( Berridge et al., 2003 1. Berridge, M.J. ∙ Bootman, M.D. ∙ Roderick, H.L. Calcium signalling: dynamics, homeostasis and remodelling Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4 :517-529 Crossref Scopus (4510) PubMed Google Scholar ; Clapham, 2007 6. Clapham, D.E. Calcium signaling Cell. 2007; 131 :1047-1058 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3361) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, future studies are warranted to identify the lactate-sensitive ER Mg 2+ release machinery.
Mechanistically, suppression of OXPHOS and increased glycolysis have been linked to intensive physical activity, sepsis, ischemia, neoplasia, and mitochondrial diseases ( Brooks, 2018 2. Brooks, G.A. The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :757-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ; Haas et al., 2016 14. Haas, R. ∙ Cucchi, D. ∙ Smith, J. ... Intermediates of Metabolism: From Bystanders to Signalling Molecules Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41 :460-471 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wallace, 2012 47. Wallace, D.C. Mitochondria and cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 :685-698 Crossref Scopus (1744) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the effect of the dramatic elevation of cellular lactate on i Mg 2+ homeostasis under these conditions remains unknown. Our identification of lactate as a ligand for ER release leading to subsequent m Mg 2+ uptake will be an invaluable research tool for probing the role of i Mg 2+ in these and countless other scenarios.
Our experiments show a lag time of about ∼25 s from lactate stimulation to m Mg 2+ accumulation, which is likely due to the ER depletion-dependent establishment of a concentration threshold (set-point) ( Figure 1 ). Our in vitro calibration data show that free Mg 2+ above ∼2.0 mM (1.0 mM pulse + 1.0 mM buffer) promotes Mrs2-mediated Mg 2+ uptake. Previous electrophysiological characterization of Mrs2P revealed a negative feedback mechanism when m Mg 2+ concentrations rose above 2 mM ( Schindl et al., 2007 42. Schindl, R. ∙ Weghuber, J. ∙ Romanin, C. ... Mrs2p forms a high conductance Mg2+ selective channel in mitochondria Biophys. J. 2007; 93 :3872-3883 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). In support of these findings, our characterization of Mrs2 activity showed a very similar inhibition phenomenon, suggesting a highly conserved regulatory property of the Mg 2+ transport machinery from yeast to mammals ( Figures 3 , 4 , and 5 ).
Unlike Ca 2+ channels, Mg 2+ channels are distributed widely across prokaryotic and eukaryotic life. In eukaryotes, plasma membrane Mg 2+ flux components are controlled by multiple machineries, while mitochondrial transport is mediated primarily by Mrs2P (yeast) and mammalian Mrs2 ( Bui et al., 1999 3. Bui, D.M. ∙ Gregan, J. ∙ Jarosch, E. ... The bacterial magnesium transporter CorA can functionally substitute for its putative homologue Mrs2p in the yeast inner mitochondrial membrane J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :20438-20443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kolisek et al., 2003 19. Kolisek, M. ∙ Zsurka, G. ∙ Samaj, J. ... Mrs2p is an essential component of the major electrophoretic Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria EMBO J. 2003; 22 :1235-1244 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Mrs2 channel family uniquely carry a conserved F/Y-GMN motif between TM1 and TM2, which is essential for Mg 2+ selectivity. We relied on Uniprot protein annotations, which are based on multiple algorithms, to assign human and murine Mrs2 topology. Based on this curated data, a large N-terminal domain is localized in the matrix due to a 49-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence ( Figures 3 and 5 ). Although electrophysiologic and structural studies would provide unequivocal evidence for whether Mrs2 forms a channel, our mutagenesis analysis strongly suggest that mammalian Mrs2 forms a selective pore for lactate-mediated m Mg 2+ uptake ( Figure 5 ).
The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of ion channels has well-known thermo-sensing abilities ( Julius, 2013 17. Julius, D. TRP channels and pain Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 29 :355-384 Crossref Scopus (873) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moqrich et al., 2005 32. Moqrich, A. ∙ Hwang, S.W. ∙ Earley, T.J. ...

TRP channels and thermosensation Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 223 :729-741 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2002 48. Xu, H. ∙ Ramsey, I.S. ∙ Kotecha, S.A. ... TRPV3 is a calcium-permeable temperature-sensitive cation channel Nature. 2002; 418 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, we showed that Mrs2-mediated m Mg 2+ influx is thermosensitive at near-physiological temperatures, in contrast to MCU, revealing another thermosensitive ion channel. We found that the human Mrs2 N-terminal domain is thermally stabilized by Mg 2+ ( Figures 3 H and 3I); thus, it is conceivable that temperature may regulate Mrs2 by affecting Mg 2+ binding to this regulatory region. The CorA ortholog is inhibited by Mg 2+ -mediated N-terminal domain interactions between protomers ( Pfoh et al., 2012 38. Pfoh, R. ∙ Li, A. ∙ Chakrabarti, N. ... Structural asymmetry in the magnesium channel CorA points to sequential allosteric regulation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :18809-18814 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this mechanism is consistent with the matrix Mg 2+ -dependent inhibition we observed ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Nevertheless, future studies are needed to precisely identify the motif/location and structural basis for the temperature sensing properties of Mrs2.
It was alluded that the concentration of intracellular free Mg 2+ is relatively high (∼0.5–1.2 mM), and thus, Mg 2+ is unlikely to act as a second messenger, like Ca 2+ , by rapidly changing compartmentalized concentrations. However, i Mg 2+ changes have profound effects on cellular metabolism, structure, and bioenergetics ( Romani and Scarpa, 1990 40. Romani, A. ∙ Scarpa, A. Hormonal control of Mg2+ transport in the heart Nature. 1990; 346 :841-844 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since i Ca 2+ and i Mg 2+ antagonistically control cellular metabolism, lowering m Mg 2+ threshold in Mrs2 KO hepatocytes was indeed found to modulate PDH activity. However, the precise link between m Mg 2+ and OXPHOS pathways warrants future studies. Here, our findings reveal that i Mg 2+ is indeed a second messenger that controls numerous cellular metabolic circuits ( Figures 6 and 7 ).
In conclusion, the identification of lactate as an agonist for i Mg 2+ dynamics represents a long-sought discovery that will rejuvenate the Mg 2+ signaling field as well as prompt further studies into the downstream physiological outcomes of i Mg 2+ flux between cellular compartments. Furthermore, lactate production and its possible consequences have been scrutinized in cells undergoing aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). A common feature of cells undergoing aerobic glycolysis, such as within the tumor microenvironment or immune cell proliferation in sepsis, is the production of copious amounts of lactate. A recent report ( Zhang et al., 2019a 49. Zhang, D. ∙ Tang, Z. ∙ Huang, H. ... Metabolic regulation of gene expression by histone lactylation Nature. 2019; 574 :575-580 Crossref Scopus (1406) PubMed Google Scholar ) highlights how lactate leads to epigenetic modifications that exert profound downstream transcriptional changes. Another study ( Zhang et al., 2019b 50. Zhang, W. ∙ Wang, G. ∙ Xu, Z.G. ... Lactate Is a Natural Suppressor of RLR Signaling by Targeting MAVS Cell. 2019; 178 :176-189.e115 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ) identified that MAVS acts as a direct sensor of lactate controlling RLR signaling and innate immunity. Our identification of lactate as a ligand establishes a new frame of reference to ascertain how perturbation of i Mg 2+ ion homeostasis may contribute to the etiology of multiple disorders.

Wild-type and Mrs2 KO C57BL/6 mice were housed and maintained in our animal breeding facility with prior approval and accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). For LPS studies, wild-type and Mrs2 KO mice were administered LPS ( E. coli O111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich; 5 mg/kg) or vehicle (sterile DPBS) via intraperitoneal injection. Body temperature was measured using a rectal thermometer (Kent Scientific Corp). After 24 h, blood was collected for serum preparation, animals were euthanized, and tissues collected for analysis ( Gandhirajan et al., 2013 12. Gandhirajan, R.K. ∙ Meng, S. ∙ Chandramoorthy, H.C. ... Blockade of NOX2 and STIM1 signaling limits lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular inflammation J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :887-902 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Primary adult mouse hepatocytes were isolated from 8 to 12-week-old male and female animals using a two-step collagenase perfusion technique ( Li et al., 2010 24. Li, W.C. ∙ Ralphs, K.L. ∙ Tosh, D. Isolation and culture of adult mouse hepatocytes Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 633 :185-196 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ), with slight modifications. After cannulation of the portal vein, the liver was perfused. First, with perfusion medium-I (Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ free HBSS; GIBCO, #14174), supplemented with 35 mM HEPES and 0.75 mM EGTA. This was followed by perfusion with perfusion medium-II (DMEM, Cat#12320, GIBCO) supplemented with collagenase D (380 μg/mL, Worthington). Liver lobes were dissected, dissociated, and the crude hepatocyte preparation passed through a 100 μM cell strainer. The crude hepatocyte preparation was centrifuged (50 × g for 5 min, 4°C) to pellet parenchymal hepatocytes. The hepatocytes were washed three times with DMEM (Cat#11885, GIBCO) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Fetal bovine serum, characterized, heat-inactivated; Hyclone, Cat# SH30396.03, GE Life Sciences, UT, USA). Centrifugation during washing steps was done at 50 × g for 5 min (4°C). After the third wash, cells were re-suspended in hepatocyte culture media (Williams E medium (Sigma, #W4128), supplemented with 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution (GIBCO, #15240), 2.0 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO, #25030), 1% (v/v) MEM non-essential amino acids (GIBCO, #11140), and 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells were plated collagen-coated plates in hepatocyte culture media. Two to four h later, the media was replaced.
All cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 , unless otherwise indicated. Hepatocytes were cultured in hepatocyte culture media (see above). HepG2 (ATCC® HB-8065) cells were cultured in DMEM (Cat#11885, GIBCO) supplemented with 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution and 10% (v/v) FBS. HeLa (ATCC® CCL-2) and COS-7 (ATCC® CRL-1651) cells were cultured in high glucose (4.5g/L) DMEM (Hyclone, #SH30022) supplemented with 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, 10% (v/v) FBS, and 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution. MEFs (ATTC ®, SCRC-1040) were cultured in high glucose (4.5g/L) DMEM (Hyclone, #SH30022) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Trypsin (0.25% for all cells except MEF cells, 0.05%; GIBCO) was used to detach cells from culture plates when necessary.
A CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing strategy was adopted to produce Mrs2 knock out (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Briefly, candidate sgRNAs were selected based on a CRISPR/Cas9 nickase design platform, which substantially reduces off-target effects by ∼50-1500 fold. The selected paired gRNAs targeting exon 8 of Mrs2 (the Cas9 nickase mRNA and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN)) for HDR-mediated gene KO were transfected into MEFs. Knockout was confirmed by genotyping by PCR followed by restriction fragment analysis with Bam H1 ( Figure 4 B). The Mrs2 targeted allele was cleaved yielding two fragments (388 and 368 bp), whereas the wild type (WT) allele was not. After validation of sgRNAs and ssODN in vitro , gRNA1, gRNA2, ssODN containing the BamHI site along with Cas9 protein was microinjected into single-celled embryo and transferred to surrogate mother. Details of the oligo’s sequence used for the Mrs2 KO are provided in Figure 4 B. The chimeras were bred with C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, USA) mice over 10 generations, and both sexes were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. Hepatocyte-specific Mcu knockouts ( MCU Δhep ) were generated by crossing MCU fl/fl mice ( Tomar et al., 2019 45. Tomar, D. ∙ Jana, F. ∙ Dong, Z. ... Blockade of MCU-Mediated Ca(2+) Uptake Perturbs Lipid Metabolism via PP4-Dependent AMPK Dephosphorylation Cell reports. 2019; 26 :3709-3725.e3707 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) with hepatocyte-specific Cre recombinase transgenic mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J, The Jackson Laboratory, USA).
All adenoviral constructs were generated by Vector Biolabs (PA, USA) using Adenoviral - Human Type 5 (dE1/E3) as the backbone wherein the gene of interest is expressed under a CMV promoter. Ad-Mrs2.mRFP.FLAG was generated using the cDNA from mouse Mrs2 ORF clone (Origene; #MR217956). The Ad-Mrs2(mut).mRFP.FLAG was generated by mutating the ORF to encode the following mutant protein sequence at aa#396-406: “IKLLKSSLKKK.” Ad-ER-MagFRET-1 and Ad-Mito-MagFRET-1 were generated using pCMVMagFRET-1 (Addgene, #50742) with modifications ( Lindenburg et al., 2013 26. Lindenburg, L.H. ∙ Vinkenborg, J.L. ∙ Oortwijn, J. ... MagFRET: the first genetically encoded fluorescent Mg2+ sensor PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e82009 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the Ad-ER-MagFRET-1 virus, the ER targeting (MLLPVLLLGLLGAAAD) and retention sequences (KDEL) were added. For the Ad-Mito-MagFRET-1 virus, the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MRKMLAAVSRVLSGASQKPASRVLVASRNFANMLHFC-SRRYRGPGIHR) was added. Cells were infected with adenoviruses at MOI’s of 20 for MagFRET constructs and 50 for Mrs2 constructs.
Primary murine hepatocytes, HepG2, HeLa, MEFs or COS7 cells were grown on 25-mm collagen-coated glass coverslips overnight and loaded with 2.5 μM of the magnesium indicator Magnesium Green-AM (ex/em 488/510 nm) and 1.0 μM of the mitochondrial indicator MitoTracker Deep Red FM (ex/em 644/665 nm) in growth media for 30 min at 37°C (5% CO 2 ). Cells were washed and imaged within a temperature-controlled environmental chamber (set at 37°C, unless otherwise indicated) using a Leica TCS SP8 live cell imaging system. After 30 s of baseline recording, various concentrations of metabolites were added ( Table S1 ), and after 375 s, a control bolus of 10 mM MgCl 2 was given. To confirm the role of lactate in mitochondrial Mg 2+ dynamics, cells were treated with MCT inhibitors, SR13800 (1 μM) or AR-C155858 (2 μM), for 2 h before measuring Mg 2+ dynamics as above. Images were obtained every 3 s using a 100 × oil objective and quantified using Leica Application Suite X.
Primary murine hepatocytes were grown on 25-mm collagen-coated glass coverslips overnight and loaded with 2.5 μM of the magnesium indicator Magnesium Green-AM (ex/em 488/510 nm). After dye loading cells were permeabilized with 40 μg/mL digitonin in 1.5 mL of intracellular medium (ICM) composed of 120 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 20 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.2 for 3 min at 37°C (5% CO 2 ). Permeabilized cells were bathed in digitonin free ICM buffer. After one minute of baseline recording, Lactate derivatives (5 mM) were added and images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 live cell imaging system. Images were obtained every 3 s using a 100 × oil objective and quantified using Leica Application Suite X.
Primary murine hepatocytes, HepG2, HeLa, MEFs or COS7 cells were grown on 25-mm collagen-coated glass coverslips overnight and loaded with 5 μM Fluo-4 AM (488nm/515nm) in Williams E medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution (GIBCO), 1% (v/v) 200 mM L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids and 10% FBS for 30 min at 37° and cells were imaged using Leica TCS SP8 live cell imaging system. Cells were transiently transfected with GCaMP6s-mt and cells mounted on a confocal chamber and imaged at Ex:488nm/Em:515nm using a Leica TCS SP8 live cell imaging system. After 30 s of baseline recording, various concentrations of metabolites were added ( Table S1 below), and after 375 s, a 10mM MgCl 2 pulse was given. Images were obtained every 3 s using at 100x oil objective and quantified using Leica Application Suite X ( Mallilankaraman et al., 2012b 29. Mallilankaraman, K. ∙ Doonan, P. ∙ Cárdenas, C. ...

Primary murine hepatocytes were washed in Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ free HBSS, pH 7.4. An equal amount of cells (∼2.5 × 10 6 cells) were resuspended and permeabilized with 40 μg/mL digitonin in 1.5 mL of intracellular medium (ICM) composed of 120 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 20 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.2 and 2 μM thapsigargin to block the SERCA pump. All the measurements were performed in the presence of 1.5 μM K + /ATP or 1.5 μM Mg 2+ /ATP (magnesium and calcium measurements, respectively), along with 5 mM succinate. The measurement of extramitochondrial Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ clearance ([Mg 2+ ] out , [Ca 2+ ] out ) was used as an indicator of [Mg 2+ ] m or [Ca 2+ ] m uptake; this done by loading the permeabilized cells with Mag-Green (1 μM; excitation 505 nm and emissions 535 and 595 nm), or Fura2-FF (0.5 μM; excitations 340 and 380 nm and emission 510 nm), respectively. Simultaneous measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by loading the permeabilized cells with JC-1 (800nM). Fluorescence was measured in a multi-wavelength excitation dual-wavelength emission spectrofluorometer (Delta RAM, PTI). [Ca 2+ ] out is represented as the excitation ratio (340 nm excitation /380 nm emission) of Fura2-FF/FA fluorescence and ΔΨ m as the ratio of the fluorescence of J-aggregate (ex/em 570/595 nm) and monomer (ex/em 490/535 nm) forms of JC-1. Similarly, [Mg 2+ ] out is represented as f.a.u. (ex/em 505/595). A single Ca 2+ (20 μM) or Mg 2+ bolus (0.25-2.00 mM) and the mitochondrial uncoupler, FCCP (10 μM), were added at the indicated time points. All the experiments were performed at either 25°C or 37°C with constant stirring ( Dong et al., 2017 9. Dong, Z. ∙ Shanmughapriya, S. ∙ Tomar, D. ...

Hepatocytes were loaded with the intracellular ratiometric pH indicator (BCECF-AM; 4 μM) for 30 min. Relative changes in fluorescence intensity of BCECF was monitored using fluorescence spectroscope (Ex 440nm and Ex 490nm; and Em 538nM). L-lactate, D-lactate, methyl L-lactate, and 3-Phenyl lactate (5 mM) were added at the indicated time points. The change intracellular pH level was determined from the ratio of BCECF (Ex;490/440) ( Halestrap, 2013 15. Halestrap, A.P. Monocarboxylic acid transport Compr. Physiol. 2013; 3 :1611-1643 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Primary murine hepatocytes or HepG2 cells were plated on 96 well Agilent Seahorse XF Cell Culture Microplates. For all primary hepatocyte experiments, the microplates were coated with collagen prior to cell addition. Primary hepatocytes were plated at a density of 4 × 10 5 cells per well, while HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 10 5 cells per well. Cells were plated in their normal growth media overnight. Media was changed to Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (Agilent) assay media supplemented with glucose, glutamine, pyruvate concentrations equivalent to that of the growth media 1 h before the experiment start time. After media change, per manufacturer instructions, cells were placed in a CO 2 -free incubator for 1 h. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured at 37°C in an XF96 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Agilent), which had been previously calibrated using Seahorse XF Calibrant solution (Seahorse Bioscience, Agilent) in a CO 2 -free incubator overnight. Respiratory chain inhibitors were then loaded into the XF96 flux analyzer, and during the run, added sequentially to cells at indicated time points. Primary cells received oligomycin, FCCP, and a mixture of antimycin A and rotenone at concentrations of 2 μM, 5 μM, and 1 μM, respectively, while HepG2 cells were treated with concentrations of inhibitors at 1 μM, 2 μM, and 0.5 μM, respectively. For treatment conditions with LPS ( E. coli O111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich) or lactate, primary hepatocytes were treated with 0.5 mM lactate acid via syringe during the experiment at the indicated time point. HepG2 cells were pre-treated with 0.5 mM lactic acid and varying concentrations of LPS (1, 10, and 100 μg/mL) for 8 h before the experiment start time. Data was collected using Agilent Seahorse Wave 2.6.1 Desktop software and exported to GraphPad Prism version 7 for analysis ( Irrinki et al., 2011 16.

Human Mrs2 (residues 58-333; NCBI accession number NP_065713.1 ) was cloned into a pET-28a expression vector (Novagen) using the NdeI and XhoI restrictions sites. Successful in-frame insertion was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. After transforming the pET-28a-Mrs2 58-333 into BL21 DE3 codon+ Escherichia coli , a single colony was grown in liquid Luria-Bertani medium containing kanamycin (60 μg mL -1 ) at 37°C to an optical density (600 nm) of ∼0.6-0.8. Protein expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Expression was allowed to proceed overnight (∼14-16 h) at 21°C. After harvesting cells by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min) and one freeze-thaw cycle (−80°C), the protein was natively purified according to the Ni-nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) manufacturer guidelines (QIAGEN), with the use of a probe sonicator for cell disruption, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 350 mM imidazole for elution. After the hexahistidine tag was bovine thrombin cleaved (∼1 U mg -1 protein) (EMD Millipore), a final size exclusion chromatography (SEC) purification step was performed through an S200 10/300 Increase GL column (GE Healthcare). The final SEC and experimental buffer was 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0. Protein concentration was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 0.8084 (mg mL) -1 cm -1 .
Protein solubilized in SEC buffer (see above) was diluted to 0.5 mg mL -1 and placed into a quartz 0.1 cm pathlength cuvette. Data was acquired between 240 – 200 nm, at a speed of 20 nm min -1 , data pitch of 1 nm and response time of 8 s on an Jasco J-810 Spectrapolarimeter with a Peltier temperature control unit (Jasco). Each spectrum is an average of 3 scans acquired using these settings and is corrected for buffer contributions. Thermal melts were acquired at the same protein concentration and using the same instrument and cuvette by monitoring the change in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of changing temperature between 20 and 90°C. The scan rate was 1°C min -1 , and the data was acquired with an 8 s response time and 1°C data pitch. We note that the Mg 2+ spectra were acquired after “addback” to the no divalent cation samples to minimize errors associated with differences in protein concentration.
Blood glucose was measure using Contour next EZ (Ascensia Diabetes Care). Serum from untreated and LPS treated mice were used for cytokine profiling (MILLIPLEX MAP Mouse Cytokine Magnetic Bead Panel, Millipore Sigma; #MCYTMAG-70K-PX32), BUN (QuantiChrom Urea Assay Kit, BioAssay Systems; #DIUR-100), Creatinine (Diazyme Creatinine Assay, Diazyme, Cat#DZ072B-K).
Lung sections were deparaffinized by 2 changes of xylene for 10 min each; slides were then rehydrated in 2 changes of 100% ethanol for 3 min, followed by 95% and 70% ethanol for 3 min, and rinsed in distilled water. Sections were boiled in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0) for 20 min. Slides were allowed to cool and incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide. Samples were blocked with avidin (15 min), biotin (15 min) and 10% normal goat serum (1 h). Slides were then incubated with primary alloantigen antibody anti-Ly-6B.2 (1:250 dilution; Biorad #MCA771GA) for 2 h. Slides were washed 3 times with PBS/Tween 20, followed by incubation with diluted secondary antibodies (biotinylated goat anti-rat-antibody 1:500 dilution; Pierce, 31830) for 1 h. Slides were incubated with ABC-HRP reagent for 30 min. and stained with DAB (Vectastain ABC-HRP kit, Vector Laboratories, PK-6101). Slides were imaged using a × 40/1.5 NA oil objective in an LSM510 META confocal imaging system. LysM6-B + leukocyte count was quantified from histologic slide images using ImageJ software.
For quantification of mRNA, RNA was extracted from 0.2–5.0 × 10 6 splenocytes or »20mg frozen lung, kidney, brain, liver, heart, muscle, or small intestine using RNeasy Plus Universal Kits (QIAGEN). cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA with the SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) with the following protocol: 25°C for 10 min, 42°C for 60 min, 85°C for 5 min. Transcript expression was measured with the appropriate primers using a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan OpenArray Real-Time PCR Master Mix as per the manufacturer’s instructions with the following protocol: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 2 min, 95°C for 1 s and 60°C for 20 s for 40 cycles. The ΔΔCt method was used for data analysis of RT-qPCR experiments.
80-200 μL of blood was collected via tail vein of C57BL/6 WT and Mrs2 KO mice and placed into K 2 EDTA-coated tubes. Following collection, blood was spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and plasma was removed from the top layer. Using a 1:3 dilution with DNase/RNase-free distilled water, glucose and lactate measurements were taken using a YSI 2900 Series Biochemistry Analyzer per the manufacturer’s instructions and reported as mg/dL.
To measure extracellular lactate, hepatocytes from WT and Mrs2 KO mice were plated in collagen-coated 6-well plates (BioCoat, Corning) at a density of 1.2 × 10 6 cells per dish in hepatocyte culture media. Cells were then treated with 100 μg/mL LPS and 20 mM sodium oxamate (Sigma-Aldrich), alone or in combination. 150 μL of media from the cells was collected at the following time points: 0 h (2 h post-plating), 8 h, and 24 h after the addition of compounds. Extracellular lactate production was then measured by subjecting collected media samples to analysis using a YSI 2900 Series Biochemistry Analyzer per the manufacturer’s instructions and results reported as mg/dL.
Primary murine hepatocytes isolated from WT and Mrs2 KO mice were grown on 25-mm collagen-coated glass coverslips overnight and loaded with lipid indicator BODIPY® (ex/em 493/503 nm, 1μg/mL) and mitochondrial membrane potential indicator tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE, ex/em 556/610 nm, 100 nM) in serum-free conditions for 30 min (37°C, 5% CO 2 ) ( Tomar et al., 2019 45. Tomar, D. ∙ Jana, F. ∙ Dong, Z. ... Blockade of MCU-Mediated Ca(2+) Uptake Perturbs Lipid Metabolism via PP4-Dependent AMPK Dephosphorylation Cell reports. 2019; 26 :3709-3725.e3707 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). The stained cells were washed and imaged at 24 h and 48 h using a Leica SP8 Confocal microscope (Manheim, Germany) coupled with a temperature-controlled environmental chamber. The acquired images were quantified using the Leica Application Suite X.
To visualize the ectopic expression of WT Mrs2 and mutant constructs, primary murine hepatocytes were infected with +Ad-Mrs2 WT and +Ad-Mrs2 mutant mRFP (ex/em 584/607 nm). Mitochondrial localization was determined by staining with dihydrorhodamine 123 (2.5 μM) (ex/em 505/524 nm) for 30 min (37°C, 5% CO 2 . Cells were washed and imaged using Leica SP8 Confocal microscope (Manheim, Germany) coupled with a temperature-controlled environmental chamber. The images were acquired using the Leica Application Suite X software and quantified.
Primary murine hepatocytes isolated from WT and Mrs2 KO mice were grown on 25-mm collagen-coated glass coverslips overnight and loaded with the mitochondrial superoxide sensitive fluorophore MitoSOX red (ex/em 556/610 nm, 5 μM) for 30 min at 37°C. The stained cells were washed and imaged using a Leica SP8 Confocal microscope (Manheim, Germany) equipped with a temperature-controlled environment chamber. The images were acquired and analyzed using the Leica Application Suite X software ( Mukhopadhyay et al., 2007 33. Mukhopadhyay, P. ∙ Rajesh, M. ∙ Haskó, G. ... Simultaneous detection of apoptosis and mitochondrial superoxide production in live cells by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :2295-2301 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Primary murine hepatocytes isolated from WT and Mrs2 KO mice were grown on 25-mm collagen-coated glass coverslips were infected with Mito-MagFRET and ER-MagFRET adenoviruses for 48 h. The sub-cellular localization of the mitochondria and ER were visualized by targeted, genetically-encoded MagFRET-1 sensors using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Manheim, Germany) in FRET mode. The cells were excited using the 405 nm laser line, and the emission was collected using the hybrid detector HyD. The Cerulean channel, 460-490 nm, and Citrine channel, 510-550 nm, served to detect the emissions from the fluorescence energy transfer ( Lindenburg et al., 2013 26. Lindenburg, L.H. ∙ Vinkenborg, J.L. ∙ Oortwijn, J. ... MagFRET: the first genetically encoded fluorescent Mg2+ sensor PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e82009 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). FRET sensitized emissions were acquired following donor and acceptor sequences. Selected Region of interests (ROIs) were drawn, and the acquired sequences were background corrected for acceptor cross excitation cross-talk, acceptor cross excitation, and FRET cross-talk (α = A/C; γ = B/C; δ = A/B). Time-lapse imaging was performed following evaluation in acquisition mode, and the corresponding FRET efficiencies were calculated. The mitochondrial and ER targeting of the MagFRET sensors were determined with selective region of interests and the corresponding FRET sensitized emissions (Relative FRET SE) were captured. To determine ΔΨ m , cells were stained with TMRE (100 nM; ex/em 556/610 nm) for 20 min and imaged in a Leica SP8 Confocal microscope.
Whole spleen was removed from WT and Mrs2KO mice and immediately placed in 37°C RPMI media (supplemented with 10% v/v FBS). Splenocytes were isolated using a two-step lysis process. Briefly, spleens were pressed through a 100 μm cell strainer with 25 mL warm RPMI (without FBS). The cell suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at 80 x g for 5 min. Cell pellet was resuspended in ACK lysis buffer and incubated at 25°C temperature for 3 min. Lysis reaction was quenched by adding 25 mL warm RPMI supplemented with 10% v/v FBS. Suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 80 x g . Cells were resuspended in RPMI (10% v/v FBS) before seeding.The splenocytes were plated on a CELL-TAK-coated glass bottom dishes for 60 min and cells loaded with cytosolic Ca 2+ indicator, Fluo-4-AM for 20 min. The splenocytes were stimulated with α-mouse-CD3/α-mouse-CD28 antibodies (2.5 μg/mL) and Ca 2+ dynamics were monitored using Leica SP8 Confocal microscope (Ex at 488nm and Em at 510nm).
To assess the NFATc3-GFP translocation, Ad-NFAT-GFP was added to the splenocyte culture at 10 MOI ( Gandhirajan et al., 2013 12. Gandhirajan, R.K. ∙ Meng, S. ∙ Chandramoorthy, H.C. ... Blockade of NOX2 and STIM1 signaling limits lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular inflammation J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :887-902 PubMed Google Scholar ). 24 h later, cells were gently swirled and placed on glass-bottom 35 mm dishes. Cells were allowed to settle for 30 min before addition of nuclear marker Hoechst (5μL/mL media) and cells were stimulated with α-mouse-CD3/α-mouse-CD28 antibodies (2.5 μg/mL) (Biolegend) or media control were added. Cells were imaged 20 min after treatment. NFAT3-GFP redistribution was imaged and quantified using Leica SP8 Confocal microscope (Hoechst: Ex at 355nm and Em at 460nm and NFAT-GFP Ex at 488nm and Em at 510nm)and expressed as cytosolic/nuclear intensity.
Cell extracts were prepared using RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific)). Equal amounts of protein were separated on 4%–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific), transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with corresponding antibodies as specified.
All data are expressed as mean ± SEM unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was evaluated using a Student’s unpaired t test for one or multiple samples, and one-way ANOVA, with p < 0.5 considered to be statistically significant. All experiments were conducted at least three times unless specified otherwise. Data from cells was obtained using built-in Leica software or ImageJ software and were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism version 8 or Sigma Plot 11.0 software. All other data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2013, GraphPad Prism version 8, or Sigma Plot 11.0 software. Charts and figures were created using GraphPad Prism version 8 software, Microsoft Office 365 Word, Microsoft Office 365 Excel, and Canvas 11 software. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001
