Title: A circuit logic for sexually shared and dimorphic aggressive behaviors in Drosophila


Abstract: Summary

Aggression involves both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions. How the brain implements these two types of actions is poorly understood. We have identified three cell types that regulate aggression in Drosophila : one type is sexually shared, and the other two are sex specific. Shared common aggression-promoting (CAP) neurons mediate aggressive approach in both sexes, whereas functionally downstream dimorphic but homologous cell types, called male-specific aggression-promoting (MAP) neurons in males and fpC1 in females, control dimorphic attack. These symmetric circuits underlie the divergence of male and female aggressive behaviors, from their monomorphic appetitive/motivational to their dimorphic consummatory phases. The strength of the monomorphic → dimorphic functional connection is increased by social isolation in both sexes, suggesting that it may be a locus for isolation-dependent enhancement of aggression. Together, these findings reveal a circuit logic for the neural control of behaviors that include both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions, which may generalize to other organisms.

Section: Introduction

Males and females of a given species often show sex-specific differences in behavior (for review, see Dulac and Kimchi, 2007 21. Dulac, C. ∙ Kimchi, T. Neural mechanisms underlying sex-specific behaviors in vertebrates Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17 :675-683 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Manoli et al., 2013 51. Manoli, D.S. ∙ Fan, P. ∙ Fraser, E.J. ... Neural control of sexually dimorphic behaviors Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2013; 23 :330-338 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). These dimorphic behaviors can be roughly divided into two categories: “pure” dimorphic behaviors, in which males and females exhibit non-overlapping motor patterns to achieve a similar goal, and “mixed” monomorphic-dimorphic behaviors, in which certain actions are common to both sexes, while other actions are dimorphic. Extensive research in multiple species has shown that “pure” sexually dimorphic behaviors (e.g., mating) are controlled by sexually dimorphic brain circuits (for review, see Asahina, 2018 4.

However, much less is known about the configuration of circuits that control and coordinate “mixed” behaviors.
Aggressive behavior in Drosophila exhibits a mixed pattern: a monomorphic appetitive and a dimorphic consummatory phase ( Chan and Kravitz, 2007 10. Chan, Y.-B. ∙ Kravitz, E.A.

Both sexes approach the opponent during the appetitive phase and then initiate the consummatory attack: males lunge and tussle whereas females headbutt ( Chan and Kravitz, 2007 10.

A great deal has been learned about neural circuit nodes that control aggression in Drosophila males (for review, see Hoopfer, 2016 32. Hoopfer, E.D. Neural control of aggression in Drosophila Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 38 :109-118 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kravitz and Fernández, 2015 45. Kravitz, E.A. ∙ Fernández, M.P. Aggression in Drosophila Behav. Neurosci. 2015; 129 :549-563 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Less work has been done on female aggression ( Deutsch et al., 2020 19.

Cell types and neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in Drosophila eLife. 2020; 9 :e58942 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) and even less on the control of the monomorphic versus dimorphic aspects of this behavior.
Two extreme models could explain the control of this mixed mono-/dimorphic behavior by the brain. In one model, all phases of male and female aggression are controlled by sex-specific circuit nodes. In support of this, most identified neurons controlling male and female aggression in flies are sex-specific, for example, Tk FruM , aSP2, and P1a cells in males, as well as aIPg and pC1d neurons in females ( Asahina et al., 2014 5.

Furthermore, manipulation of sex-determination genes like fruitless or transformer switches the pattern of sex-specific fighting ( Chan and Kravitz, 2007 10. Chan, Y.-B. ∙ Kravitz, E.A. Specific subgroups of FruM neurons control sexually dimorphic patterns of aggression in Drosophila melanogaster Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :19577-19582 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vrontou et al., 2006 73. Vrontou, E. ∙ Nilsen, S.P. ∙ Demir, E. ... fruitless regulates aggression and dominance in Drosophila Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9 :1469-1471 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an alternative model, the mono- and dimorphic phases of aggression could be controlled by mono- and dimorphic circuit nodes, respectively. The fact that male and female aggression can be induced by common external or internal triggers ( Lim et al., 2014 47. Lim, R.S. ∙ Eyjólfsdóttir, E. ∙ Shin, E. ... How food controls aggression in Drosophila PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e105626 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002 71. Ueda, A. ∙ Kidokoro, Y. Aggressive behaviours of female Drosophila melanogaster are influenced by their social experience and food resources Physiol. Entomol. 2002; 27 :21-28 Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2008 74. Wang, L. ∙ Dankert, H. ∙ Perona, P. ... A common genetic target for environmental and heritable influences on aggressiveness in Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :5657-5663 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ) is consistent with such a model. However, sexually shared neurons that control monomorphic features of aggression have not yet been identified.
Here, we identify a pair of sexually shared neurons whose activation increases aggressive approach toward same-sex targets in both males and females. We also identify homologous, male- and female-specific interneurons that promote male- or female-specific attack behavior, respectively. We show that the dimorphic neurons are functionally downstream of the common neurons in both sexes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the functional connectivity of this circuit motif is strengthened in isolated males and females, which are more aggressive than group-housed (GH) flies ( Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002 71. Ueda, A. ∙ Kidokoro, Y. Aggressive behaviours of female Drosophila melanogaster are influenced by their social experience and food resources Physiol. Entomol. 2002; 27 :21-28 Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2008 74. Wang, L. ∙ Dankert, H. ∙ Perona, P. ... A common genetic target for environmental and heritable influences on aggressiveness in Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :5657-5663 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these data suggest a circuit logic for the neural control of a “mixed” monomorphic-dimorphic social behavior and identify a potential locus for experience-dependent modulation of this behavior.

Section: Results

We first characterized aggression in wild-type flies of both sexes and developed automated classifiers for quantifying the appetitive (approach) and the consummatory (attack) phases of aggression ( Figure 1 ) ( Craig, 1917 16. Craig, W. Appetites and aversions as constituents of instincts Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1917; 3 :685-688 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Tinbergen, 1951 69. Tinbergen, N. The Study of Instinct Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1951 Google Scholar ). An approach bout occurs similarly in both sexes and typically involves three motor elements: orientation from a distance, advance, and contact ( Figures 1 A and S1 A; Video S1 ). In contrast, attack is sexually dimorphic: in males it includes lunging, in which the behaving fly raises its upper body with its front legs up, and slams down onto its target ( Chen et al., 2002 12. Chen, S. ∙ Lee, A.Y. ∙ Bowens, N.M. ... Fighting fruit flies: a model system for the study of aggression Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :5664-5668 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hoyer et al., 2008 34. Hoyer, S.C. ∙ Eckart, A. ∙ Herrel, A. ... Octopamine in male aggression of Drosophila Curr. Biol. 2008; 18 :159-167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ); in females it includes headbutting that comprises a quick horizontal thrust in the direction of the target fly, resulting in contact ( Figure 1 A; Video S2 ) ( Nilsen et al., 2004 55. Nilsen, S.P. ∙ Chan, Y.-B. ∙ Huber, R. ... Gender-selective patterns of aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :12342-12347 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). These monomorphic (approach) and dimorphic (lunge/headbutt) aggressive behaviors could be reliably detected by our behavioral classifiers ( Figure S1 D; Table S2 ).

Aggression can be promoted by social isolation or by food in both males and females ( Lim et al., 2014 47. Lim, R.S. ∙ Eyjólfsdóttir, E. ∙ Shin, E. ... How food controls aggression in Drosophila PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e105626 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002 71. Ueda, A. ∙ Kidokoro, Y. Aggressive behaviours of female Drosophila melanogaster are influenced by their social experience and food resources Physiol. Entomol. 2002; 27 :21-28 Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2008 74. Wang, L. ∙ Dankert, H. ∙ Perona, P. ... A common genetic target for environmental and heritable influences on aggressiveness in Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :5657-5663 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, direct, quantitative comparisons of these effects on the two sexes have not been performed. We therefore investigated how males and females respond to food or social isolation (SI), during or prior to aggressive encounters, respectively. Both SI and food increased aggression in both sexes, albeit to different extents ( Figures 1 B and 1C). However, the GH females showed a higher level of baseline aggression than their male counterparts ( Figures 1 Bi and 1Ci, GH). Thus, male and female aggressiveness can be increased by similar environmental influences, despite their dimorphic attack behavior. These influences may act in parallel on sexually dimorphic circuits ( Figure 1 D, model 1), or via a module common to both sexes ( Figure 1 D, model 2). To distinguish between these models, we next investigated the relationship between neural circuits controlling aggression in males versus females.
A distinguishing feature of model 2 is an aggression-promoting node common to both sexes ( Figure 1 D, model 2, “C”). We therefore searched for such neurons, by re-screening in females Gal4 drivers identified previously in a large-scale screen for aggression-promoting neurons in males ( Hoopfer et al., 2015 33. Hoopfer, E.D. ∙ Jung, Y. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ... P1 interneurons promote a persistent internal state that enhances inter-male aggression in Drosophila eLife. 2015; 4 :e11346 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). This screen yielded a promising candidate, line R60G08-Gal4 (R60G08 neurons, henceforth), optogenetic activation of which strongly promoted both approach, and dimorphic attack, in both sexes ( Figure S2 A).
R60G08-Gal4 drives expression in roughly 80 neurons in males and 64 neurons in females ( Figure S2 B). This sex difference could reflect quantitative or qualitative differences in aggression neurons. We first confirmed that aggression is promoted by the R60G08 neurons in the brain but not in the ventral nerve cord of both sexes ( Figure S2 C). To narrow down the subset of neurons that control aggression, we used an “enhancer bashing” strategy to further fractionate the R60G08 population ( Figure 2 A) ( Hobert and Kratsios, 2019 30. Hobert, O. ∙ Kratsios, P. Neuronal identity control by terminal selectors in worms, flies, and chordates Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2019; 56 :97-105 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ; Luo et al., 2008 50. Luo, L. ∙ Callaway, E.M. ∙ Svoboda, K. Genetic dissection of neural circuits Neuron. 2008; 57 :634-660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (619) PubMed Google Scholar ). To this end, we divided the 1.5-kb R60G08 cis- regulatory module (CRM) sequence ( Jenett et al., 2012 37. Jenett, A. ∙ Rubin, G.M. ∙ Ngo, T.-T.B. ... A GAL4-driver line resource for Drosophila neurobiology Cell Rep. 2012; 2 :991-1001 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (947) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pfeiffer et al., 2008 58. Pfeiffer, B.D. ∙ Jenett, A. ∙ Hammonds, A.S. ... Tools for neuroanatomy and neurogenetics in Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :9715-9720 Crossref Scopus (701) PubMed Google Scholar ) into five 0.5-kb partially overlapping fragments and generated corresponding Gal4 drivers inserted into the same genomic locus (Enhancer bashing [Eb] 1-5 Gal4s).
This approach yielded new Gal4 drivers with sparse labeling of R60G08 neuron subsets in the two sexes ( Figures 2 B and S3 A). Among these, optogenetic activation of Eb5-Gal4 neurons (Eb5 neurons, henceforth) triggered robust male and female aggression ( Figure 2 C), suggesting that these cells may account for R60G08 neuron-induced aggression. To test this hypothesis, we activated R60G08 neurons in the parental Gal4 driver line, while “subtracting” Eb5 neurons using Gal80 (R60G08 + /Eb5 − ). Such activation yielded little or no detectable increase in male or female aggression ( Figure S3 B). These data indicate that Eb5 neurons are required for R60G08 neuron-induced aggression.
Eb5-Gal4 labeled a pair of neurons in each male hemi-brain and a single neuron in each female hemi-brain ( Figure 2 B). A subset of these neurons expressed dsx-Gal4 , but none expressed FruM ( Figure S3 C). To further subdivide the two Eb5 neurons identified in males, we visualized their morphology using photo-activatable GFP (PA-GFP) ( Datta et al., 2008 18. Datta, S.R. ∙ Vasconcelos, M.L. ∙ Ruta, V. ... The Drosophila pheromone cVA activates a sexually dimorphic neural circuit Nature. 2008; 452 :473-477 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ruta et al., 2010 63. Ruta, V. ∙ Datta, S.R. ∙ Vasconcelos, M.L. ... A dimorphic pheromone circuit in Drosophila from sensory input to descending output Nature. 2010; 468 :686-690 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ). This revealed two morphologically distinct cell types. One of the cell types resembled the Eb5 neuron labeled in females, whereas the other was dissimilar and appeared only in males ( Figures 2 Di, 2Dii, and 2Ei). We then generated intersectional drivers that separately labeled these two classes of Eb5 neurons in males, using R22F05 CRM ( Figures 2 Diii–2Dv, 2Eiii, S3 D, S3E, and S4Ai ) ( Hoopfer et al., 2015 33. Hoopfer, E.D. ∙ Jung, Y. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ... P1 interneurons promote a persistent internal state that enhances inter-male aggression in Drosophila eLife. 2015; 4 :e11346 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). We refer to these cells as common aggression-promoting (CAP) neurons and male-specific aggression-promoting (MAP) neurons, respectively. Both the CAP and MAP drivers labeled neurons exclusively in the brain ( Figure S4 B).
We first investigated the function of the shared CAP neurons in males and females. We optogenetically activated CAP neurons and examined the effect on interactions between pairs of freely moving GH flies of both sexes. When the CAP neurons were activated, both males and females initiated significantly more approach bouts during the stimulation period ( Figure 3 Ai). We next asked whether CAP neurons evoke generic approach toward any object, and whether approach was biased toward same- or opposite-sex flies. To this end, we developed an approach preference assay, in which we provided pairs of different “target objects” in the chamber, and asked whether the GH tester fly preferentially approached one of the targets during CAP activation. Initially, we gave each tester fly a choice between a same-sex dead fly or a fly-sized object (magnet; Figure 3 Bi). Both sexes of tester flies exhibited a higher percentage of approach bouts directed toward the fly target ( Figure 3 Bi). This result suggests that stimulation of CAP neurons preferentially promotes approach to conspecifics, relative to an inanimate object.
We then investigated whether the approach promoted by CAP neurons was biased toward same- or opposite-sex conspecifics. Drosophila males normally do not attack females (even if aggression-promoting neurons are activated) ( Figure S5 A), and female flies of other species most frequently attack females, in competition for oviposition sites ( Fernández et al., 2010 25. Fernández, M.P. ∙ Chan, Y.B. ∙ Yew, J.Y. ... Pheromonal and behavioral cues trigger male-to-female aggression in Drosophila PLoS Biol. 2010; 8 :e1000541 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shelly, 1999 67. Shelly, T.E. Defense of oviposition sites by female oriental fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) Fla. Entomol. 1999; 82 :339-346 Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar ). Consistent with this, during CAP stimulation, male testers preferred male over female targets, whereas female testers showed the opposite tendency ( Figure 3 Bii; Video S3 ). The tester’s target preference was not affected by the duration of its interaction with the targets prior to CAP stimulation ( Figure S5 B). More importantly, if both targets were female, no difference in target preference was observed between CAP-stimulated male versus female testers ( Figure 3 Biii). Furthermore, wing extension, a male courtship behavior ( Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1967 7. Bennet-Clark, H.C. ∙ Ewing, A.W. Stimuli provided by courtship of male Drosophila melanogaster Nature. 1967; 215 :669-671 Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar ; von Philipsborn et al., 2011 72. von Philipsborn, A.C. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Yu, J.Y. ... Neuronal control of Drosophila courtship song Neuron. 2011; 69 :509-522 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) that was induced naturally by the presence of a female (alive or dead), was not promoted by CAP activation ( Figure 3 Aiii). These data therefore indicate that CAP neurons promote approach toward sex-appropriate targets of aggressive behavior.

Last, we examined how aggression was affected in the two sexes when the CAP neurons were silenced. To do this, we enhanced natural aggressiveness using social isolation and silenced the CAP neurons using the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 ( Baines et al., 2001 6. Baines, R.A. ∙ Uhler, J.P. ∙ Thompson, A. ... Altered electrical properties in Drosophila neurons developing without synaptic transmission J. Neurosci. 2001; 21 :1523-1531 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Silencing the CAP neurons greatly decreased overall aggressiveness in both sexes, as indicated by a significant reduction in the number of both approach and attack bouts ( Figure 3 C). The locomotor activity of CAP > Kir2.1 flies was comparable to that of CAP > GFP controls ( Figure S5 C), suggesting that the effect to inhibit aggression is not due to a general reduction in vigor. Conditional silencing with the optogenetic inhibitor, GtACR ( Mohammad et al., 2017 54. Mohammad, F. ∙ Stewart, J.C. ∙ Ott, S. ... Optogenetic inhibition of behavior with anion channelrhodopsins Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :271-274 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) or the temperature-dependent inhibitory effector, Shibire ts , was not feasible due to adverse effects of green light or the non-permissive temperature on aggression in control flies. Together, these data indicate that although activation of CAP neurons only promotes approach, the activity of these cells is required for both the approach and attack phases of male and female aggression. This further supports the idea that CAP neurons promote aggressive rather than generic approach.
As part of our optogenetic protocol, we performed a stimulation titration experiment, in which we activated the CAP neurons in males and females with five different LED intensities titrated from 0.1 to 0.62 μW/mm 2 ( Figure 4 A). Unexpectedly, this experiment revealed sex differences in the threshold for CAP stimulation-induced aggression. In GH females, approach was elicited at low photostimulation intensities (0.1 μW/mm 2 ), whereas headbutting was elicited at higher intensities (0.43 μW/mm 2 ) ( Figures 4 Ai ➀ and 4Aiii ③). By contrast, in GH males, lunging behavior was not evoked, even at the highest light stimulation intensity tested ( Figure 4 Aiv). Furthermore, in females the threshold intensity for eliciting approach (0.1 μW/mm 2 ) ( Figure 4 Ai ➀) was substantially (4-fold) lower than in males (0.43 μW/mm 2 ) ( Figure 4 Aii ③).
We asked what neural mechanism(s) might underlie the sex differences in the effects of CAP stimulation. We hypothesized that in females, CAP neurons might be intrinsically more excitable than in males. To test this idea, we performed an in vivo all-optical stimulation and imaging experiment to quantify the responses of CAP neurons to optogenetic activation in each sex ( Figure 4 Bi). When activated using photostimulation at the same frequency and intensity, female CAP neurons showed a slightly higher GCaMP fluorescence increase than did male CAP neurons ( Figure 4 Bi; p = 0.034, but non-significant after the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Importantly, the fluorescence intensities of both Chrimson::tdTomato and GCaMP in the CAP neurons were statistically indistinguishable between sexes ( Figure 4 Bii). Although this sex difference in the excitability is consistent with the observed difference in the threshold for CAP-evoked aggression, other mechanisms are likely involved.
Together, our titration experiments indicated that in GH females, CAP neurons can evoke approach and attack (headbutting), in a scalable manner. In contrast, CAP neurons only evoked approach behavior in GH males. One explanation for this difference is that in males, CAP neurons do not connect with neurons that control attack. Alternatively, they may make such a connection, but one that is weaker than in females. To distinguish these alternatives, we next sought to identify attack-promoting neurons in males and to determine their functional interaction with CAP neurons.
First, we asked whether MAP neurons might control the attack phase of aggression in males. Indeed, in GH males, optogenetic activation of MAP neurons strongly promoted lunging, while activation of CAP neurons was insufficient to do so ( Figure 5 A). Furthermore, in contrast to CAP neurons, activating MAP neurons did not increase the number of approach bouts initiated during photostimulation, relative to baseline or to genetic controls ( Figures 3 Aii and S4Aii ). Consequently, MAP-induced lunging typically occurred during serendipitous close encounters between flies ( Video S1 ). Consistent with these observations, the frequency of lunge bouts, but not that of approach bouts, was significantly diminished when MAP neurons were silenced using Kir2.1 ( Figures 5 B and S5 C). To further confirm these results, we activated both CAP and MAP neurons simultaneously using Chrimson, while specifically inhibiting MAP neurons with Kir2.1 ( Figure 5 C). Both approach and lunging behaviors were strongly increased when CAP and MAP neurons were co-activated ( Figures 2 Ci and 2Cii). The number of lunge bouts and the fraction of approaches leading to lunges were suppressed by MAP inhibition but not the number of approaches initiated (compare Figure 5 C with Figure 3 C). Taken together, these results suggest that the sexually shared CAP neurons are required for the initiation of approach in both males and females, while the male-specific MAP neurons are required for male-specific attack (lunging) ( Figure 5 E); both populations may contribute to the transition from approach to attack.
Anatomical analysis indicated that CAP and MAP neurites lie in close proximity ( Figures 2 Bi and 2Bii), suggesting that MAP neurons might be a downstream target of CAP neurons in males. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vivo calcium imaging in MAP neurons while optogenetically stimulating CAP neurons. Indeed, GCaMP fluorescence signals in MAP neurons were significantly elevated during CAP photostimulation, suggesting that the former lie functionally downstream of the latter ( Figure 6 Aii). However, these experiments do not distinguish whether this functional connection is direct (monosynaptic) or indirect.
The foregoing results indicated that in GH males, CAP activation promotes approach, and MAP activation, in turn, promotes attack. Paradoxically, in GH females, strong CAP activation could evoke both approach and attack ( Figures 4 Aiii and 5 D), but no MAP neurons were labeled by the Eb5 or MAP drivers. One explanation for this paradox is that CAP neurons in females directly control both approach and attack. Alternatively, females may contain a sex-specific homolog of MAP neurons, which was not labeled by our Gal4 drivers, and that controls headbutting (attack). We therefore searched for MAP-like neurons in females, using anatomical methods.
The morphology of the MAP cells resembles that of pC1 neurons, a cluster of cells labeled by the intersection of NP2631-Gal4 and dsx -Flp ( Figure 2 E). Thermogenetic activation of the pC1 NP2631;dsxFlp cluster was reported to promote aggression in both males and females ( Ishii et al., 2020 36. Ishii, K. ∙ Wohl, M. ∙ DeSouza, A. ...

However, MAP neurons were not labeled by NP2631-Gal4 ( Figure S4 D), suggesting they might be a distinct pC1 subtype. The numbers of pC1 neurons differ in the two sexes (53–65 and 5–10 neurons per hemisphere in males and females, respectively) (for review, see Asahina, 2018 4. Asahina, K. Sex differences in Drosophila behavior: qualitative and quantitative dimorphism Curr. Opin. Physiol. 2018; 6 :35-45 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), and these neurons can be further divided into morphologically distinct subtypes ( Costa et al., 2016 15.

Wang, F. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Forknall, N. ... Neural circuitry linking mating and egg laying in Drosophila females Nature. 2020; 579 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raised the possibility that a functional homolog of MAP neurons might exist among pC1 neurons in females.
Recently, a group of female-specific neurons intersectionally labeled by R26E01-Gal4 and dsx -Flp were shown to trigger intense female aggression when thermogenetically activated ( Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019 56. Palavicino-Maggio, C.B. ∙ Chan, Y.B. ∙ McKellar, C. ... A small number of cholinergic neurons mediate hyperaggression in female Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :17029-17038 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). These cells were identified as a female-specific subtype of pC1 neurons. We therefore labeled similar cells using a different intersectional strategy, in which R26E01-AD and dsx-DBD hemi-drivers were used to generate a split-Gal4 ( Figure 6 Bi). Cells labeled by this split-Gal4 driver in females exhibited a main projection pattern similar to that of MAP neurons, but additionally extended a short, lateral branch and a long, ventral branch (compare Figure 6 Ai versus 6 Bi). No neurons were labeled in the male brain ( Figure S4 Ei). The overall morphology of these cells resembles that of pC1d neurons, a subtype of pC1 neurons that recently has been shown to promote female aggression ( Deutsch et al., 2020 19. Deutsch, D. ∙ Pacheco, D.A. ∙ Encarnacion-rivera, L. ... The neural basis for a persistent internal state in Drosophila females eLife. 2020; Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar ; Schretter et al., 2020 65. Schretter, C.E. ∙ Aso, Y. ∙ Robie, A.A. ... Cell types and neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in Drosophila eLife. 2020; 9 :e58942 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 75. Wang, F. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Forknall, N. ... Neural circuitry linking mating and egg laying in Drosophila females Nature. 2020; 579 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore refer to these neurons as “fpC1” cells. Unfortunately, it was not possible to establish definitively correspondence between fpC1 and pC1d neurons, due to driver incompatibility. Because of their anatomic similarity to MAP neurons in males, these data raised the possibility that fpC1 neurons might be female analogs or homologs of MAP neurons.
Because previous studies of R26E01-Gal4;dsx-FLP neurons used thermogenetic activation, and did not include analysis of approach behavior ( Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019 56. Palavicino-Maggio, C.B. ∙ Chan, Y.B. ∙ McKellar, C. ... A small number of cholinergic neurons mediate hyperaggression in female Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :17029-17038 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), we first activated these neurons optogenetically ( Figure 6 C). Such activation promoted female attack (headbutting; Figure 6 Cii), but not approach behavior ( Figure 6 Ci). We confirmed that this phenotype is due to activation of fpC1 neurons in the brain, but not of those in the ventral nerve cord ( Figure S4 Eii). Finally, we silenced fpC1 neurons using Kir2.1. This manipulation strongly suppressed headbutting, but did not affect approach ( Figures 6 D and S5 C). Thus, the behavioral phenotype of activating and silencing fpC1 neurons in females was analogous to that of activating and silencing MAP neurons in males ( Figures 3 Aii, 5 Aii, and 5B).
Because MAP neurons receive excitatory input from CAP neurons in males, we hypothesized that fpC1 neurons may likewise receive excitatory input from CAP neurons in females. Indeed, fpC1 neurons responded strongly to CAP activation ( Figure 6 Bii), suggesting that they are indeed direct or indirect synaptic targets of the latter cells. Next, we performed a behavioral epistasis experiment, in which CAP neurons were strongly activated while silencing fpC1 neurons with Kir2.1 ( Figure 6 E). In this compound genotype, CAP-induced female aggression was suppressed. Together, these data suggest that fpC1 neurons are functionally, as well as physiologically, downstream of CAP cells in females. If so, it would suggest an analogous circuit motif controlling aggression in the two sexes, in which the sexually shared CAP neurons target MAP neurons in males, and fpC1 neurons in females ( Figure 6 F).
We observed that CAP stimulation caused a relatively greater increase in ΔF/F in fpC1 than in MAP neurons ( Figures 6 Aii versus 6 Bii, Stim). This difference was not due to sex differences in Chrimson expression in CAP neurons ( Figure 4 Bii), or in baseline GCaMP expression in MAP versus fpC1 neurons ( Figure S4 F). One possibility is that the CAP → fpC1 functional connection in females is stronger than the CAP → MAP connection in males. This would be consistent with our observation that strong CAP activation in GH females evoked both approach and attack, whereas in GH males it evoked only approach. Alternatively, fpC1 neurons may be intrinsically more excitable than MAP neurons.
The effect of social isolation to increase aggression has been observed in many species ( Chiara et al., 2019 14. Chiara, V. ∙ Ramon Portugal, F. ∙ Jeanson, R. Social intolerance is a consequence, not a cause, of dispersal in spiders PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000319 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tóth et al., 2008 70.

The neuropeptide Tac2 controls a distributed brain state induced by chronic social isolation stress Cell. 2018; 173 :1265-1279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus wondered how social isolation can boost aggressiveness in both males and females, despite their differences in aggression circuitry and behavior. Social isolation may act to increase the excitability of CAP neuron in both sexes, the excitability of both MAP and fpC1 neurons, or the strength of the connection between CAP → MAP/fpC1 neurons. To address this, we investigated the excitability and functional connectivity of these neurons in GH versus single-housed (SH) flies.
We first compared the excitability of each of the three neuron types in GH versus SH flies by co-expressing Chrimson and GCaMP in each cell and optogenetically activating and imaging them. In both sexes, the response amplitude of each of these neurons to direct activation was comparable in SH versus GH flies ( Figure S6 ). We next imaged MAP or fpC1 neurons while optogenetically stimulating CAP neurons. In both sexes, the response of MAP/fpC1 neurons to CAP activation was significantly greater in SH than in GH flies ( Figure 7 A). These results suggest that the CAP → MAP functional connection in males and the CAP → fpC1 functional connection in females may be strengthened by social isolation.
To examine the behavioral consequences of this enhanced functional connectivity, we optogenetically activated CAP neurons in SH flies of both sexes ( Figures 7 B and 7C), at the lowest photostimulation intensity used for GH flies in our titration experiment ( Figure 4 A). SH flies exhibited increased approach behavior in both sexes, in comparison to GH flies ( Figures 7 Bi and 7Ci, GH → SH, “ChR”). More importantly, in both sexes, weak activation of CAP neurons in SH flies triggered both approach and sex-specific attack behaviors ( Figures 7 Bii and 7Cii, GH → SH, “ChR”), a phenotype not observed in GH flies of either sex at this stimulation intensity ( Figures 7 Bii and 7Cii, GH → GH, “ChR”). Thus, in SH males, weak activation of CAP neurons promoted both approach and lunging, a response not observed in GH males even at the highest photostimulation intensity tested ( Figure 4 Aiv). Taken together, our in vivo imaging analyses and behavioral experiments support the conclusion that social isolation elevates aggressiveness in both sexes, at least in part, by strengthening the functional connectivity between CAP neurons and their downstream MAP/fpC1 targets.

Section: Discussion

How behaviors that exhibit sexually monomorphic, as well as dimorphic, action components are implemented in the brain is poorly understood. Here, we have identified three cell types that regulate aggression in Drosophila : one type is sexually shared and the other two are sex-specific. The shared cell type, called CAP neurons, mediates aggressive approach in both sexes, and in turn activates the dimorphic cell types, called MAP in males and fpC1 in females, which control dimorphic attack ( Figure 7 D). These mirrored circuit motifs therefore underlie the divergence of male and female aggressive behaviors, from their monomorphic appetitive/motivational to their dimorphic consummatory phases. This circuit logic may generalize to other behaviors and organisms.
The results presented here suggest that in both sexes the approach versus attack phases of aggression are controlled by different neuron types. Importantly, the approach behavior controlled by CAP neurons is directed preferentially toward same-sex conspecifics and is required for natural attack, arguing that it expresses aggressive motivation, and not simply generic social investigation. However, this conclusion presents a seeming paradox: if approach behavior is required for attack during natural aggression, how can experimental MAP stimulation cause attack without promoting approach behavior as well?
Close examination of fighting patterns during MAP stimulation suggests an explanation for this paradox. Tester males lunged during MAP stimulation only when the target fly was in close proximity. Such proximity resulted from both directed approaches and through serendipitous close encounters, such as when a climbing target fly fell off the chamber wall next to the tester ( Video S1 ). The relatively small arenas (16 mm in diameter) used in our experiments increased the frequency of the latter type of events. Indeed, the majority (75%) of lunge bouts promoted by MAP stimulation occurred following such serendipitous close encounters. Moreover, once an initial MAP-evoked lunge occurred, tester males could perform lunges continuously toward the target as long as it remained in proximity ( Figure S5 D). In this way, MAP stimulation can promote lunging without also promoting approach.
We find that approach and attack are triggered at progressively higher stimulation intensities. Other studies have shown that a single pair of descending neurons controls sequential male courtship actions in a ramp-to-threshold manner ( McKellar et al., 2019 53. McKellar, C.E. ∙ Lillvis, J.L. ∙ Bath, D.E. ... Threshold-based ordering of sequential actions during Drosophila courtship Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :426-434.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our observations are consistent with such a mechanism operating to control the transition from approach to attack, but further studies will be required to validate this hypothesis ( Figure 7 E). Similarly, in mammals, optogenetic stimulation of estrogen receptor 1-positive (Esr1 + ) neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) has been shown to promote sniffing/mounting and attack at low versus high thresholds, respectively ( Lee et al., 2014 46. Lee, H. ∙ Kim, D.W. ∙ Remedios, R. ... Scalable control of mounting and attack by Esr1+ neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus Nature. 2014; 509 :627-632 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, calcium imaging has revealed substantial overlap between attack- versus sniff-tuned VMHvl Esr1+ neurons ( Remedios et al., 2017 60. Remedios, R. ∙ Kennedy, A. ∙ Zelikowsky, M. ... Social behaviour shapes hypothalamic neural ensemble representations of conspecific sex Nature. 2017; 550 :388-392 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, distinct populations of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) have been shown to be active during the appetitive versus consummatory phases of feeding behavior ( Jennings et al., 2015 38. Jennings, J.H. ∙ Ung, R.L. ∙ Resendez, S.L. ... Visualizing hypothalamic network dynamics for appetitive and consummatory behaviors Cell. 2015; 160 :516-527 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether these distinct populations are functionally interconnected, and whether they control their respective behaviors at different thresholds, is not yet clear.
Despite the overall similarity in circuit logic between males and females, the light-intensity threshold for optogenetically induced CAP-mediated approach is lower in females. Our data indicate that this difference may reflect, at least in part, a higher intrinsic excitability of CAP cells in GH females than in males. This difference may also explain why wild-type GH females are more aggressive than wild-type GH males ( Figures 1 Bi and 1Ci, GH), although further studies are required to confirm this.
In addition, the intensity threshold for attack stimulated by optogenetic activation of CAP cells is lower in females than in males, particularly in GH flies where stimulation of CAP neurons in males does not promote attack at all ( Figure 4 A). In SH flies, however, attack, as well as approach, could be evoked by CAP stimulation in both sexes ( Figures 7 B and 7C). One explanation for this sex difference is that in GH males, the threshold for MAP activation by CAP cells is higher than the threshold for fpC1 activation in females. In SH males, however, because the excitability of the CAP → MAP connection is enhanced, this threshold can be reached and therefore lunging can be evoked by CAP stimulation ( Figures 7 Ai and 7Bii). The synaptic basis for this physiological dimorphism remains to be investigated.
The symmetry between the CAP → MAP circuit in males and the CAP → fpC1 circuit in females raises the question of whether MAP and fpC1 neurons are sex-specific, analogous cell types. pC1 neurons, a large (∼50-cell) cluster of doublesex -expressing cells labeled by NP2631-Gal4 ( Koganezawa et al., 2016 44. Koganezawa, M. ∙ Kimura, K. ∙ Yamamoto, D. The neural circuitry that functions as a switch for courtship versus aggression in Drosophila males Curr. Biol. 2016; 26 :1395-1403 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), promote both male and female aggression ( Ishii et al., 2020 36. Ishii, K. ∙ Wohl, M. ∙ DeSouza, A. ... Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and target preference via sexually dimorphic neurons eLife. 2020; 9 :e52701 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koganezawa et al., 2016 44.

Biol. 2016; 26 :1395-1403 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recent studies have suggested that a sex-specific subpopulation of pC1 neurons, called pC1d, controls aggression in females ( Deutsch et al., 2020 19. Deutsch, D. ∙ Pacheco, D.A. ∙ Encarnacion-rivera, L. ...

USA. 2019; 116 :17029-17038 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schretter et al., 2020 65. Schretter, C.E. ∙ Aso, Y. ∙ Robie, A.A. ...

Wang, F. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Forknall, N. ... Neural circuitry linking mating and egg laying in Drosophila females Nature. 2020; 579 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). These cells resemble fpC1 cells ( Figure 6 Bi); although establishing correspondence between these pC1 subtypes is currently challenging due to Gal4 driver incompatibility and the multiplicity of morphologically similar cell types within a cluster.
Our data suggest that MAP neurons may represent a male-specific subclass of pC1 neurons. Although MAP neurons are not labeled by NP2631-Gal4 ( Figure S4 D), the cell body location and the morphology of these cells appear similar to that of some pC1 neurons ( Figure 2 Eiv), an observation supported by NBlast analysis ( Figure S4 C). MAP and fpC1 neurons share their main projection patterns, but the latter have two extra branches projecting laterally and ventrally ( Figures 6 Ai and 6Bi). This suggests that these two cell types are indeed functional homologs. This point should be further clarified once an EM-level connectome of the male fly brain is available.
Although our data provide an overall logic for the functional organization of male versus female aggression circuits, they leave out the details of its implementation. For example, it is not yet clear whether CAP → MAP/fpC1 connections are direct or indirect and exclusively feed-forward or are also recurrent. Our initial examination of the female EM connectome identified several candidate CAP-like neurons, some of which make direct monosynaptic connections with fpC1-like pC1d neurons. pC1d neurons, in turn, connect to aIP-g neurons, which also promote female aggression; however, there is extensive recurrence between pC1d and aIP-g cells ( Deutsch et al., 2020 19. Deutsch, D. ∙ Pacheco, D.A. ∙ Encarnacion-rivera, L. ... The neural basis for a persistent internal state in Drosophila females eLife. 2020; Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar , Schretter et al., 2020 65. Schretter, C.E. ∙ Aso, Y. ∙ Robie, A.A. ... Cell types and neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in Drosophila eLife. 2020; 9 :e58942 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although a male EM connectome is not yet available, several other groups of male-specific neurons, such as the FruM + tachykinin(Tk)-expressing neurons, have been previously shown to play important roles in male aggression ( Asahina et al., 2014 5. Asahina, K. ∙ Watanabe, K. ∙ Duistermars, B.J. ... Tachykinin-expressing neurons control male-specific aggressive arousal in Drosophila Cell. 2014; 156 :221-235 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hoopfer, 2016 32. Hoopfer, E.D. Neural control of aggression in Drosophila Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 38 :109-118 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kravitz and Fernández, 2015 45. Kravitz, E.A. ∙ Fernández, M.P. Aggression in Drosophila Behav. Neurosci. 2015; 129 :549-563 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether and how these male-specific neurons interact with CAP and MAP neurons to regulate male aggression remains largely unexplored. Initial epistasis experiments suggest that Tk neurons act downstream of the Eb5 (CAP+MAP) neurons to regulate aggression ( Figure S7 ). In the future, it will be interesting to clarify the implementation of connectivity between CAP, MAP, and Tk neurons once a male connectome becomes available. Nevertheless, the functional pathways defined by CAP and MAP/fpC1 neurons establish a conceptual framework for understanding how monomorphic and dimorphic aggressive behaviors are regulated in the two sexes.
A fundamental question that emerges from the sexual dimorphism in fly aggressive behavior ( Nilsen et al., 2004 55. Nilsen, S.P. ∙ Chan, Y.-B. ∙ Huber, R. ... Gender-selective patterns of aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :12342-12347 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vrontou et al., 2006 73. Vrontou, E. ∙ Nilsen, S.P. ∙ Demir, E. ... fruitless regulates aggression and dominance in Drosophila Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9 :1469-1471 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) is whether the central motive state of aggressiveness is encoded similarly or differently in the two sexes. Our data suggest that CAP neurons might be candidates for controlling an internal state of aggressiveness that is common to both sexes. Two lines of evidence support this idea. First, CAP stimulation promotes the appetitive phase of aggression ( Figure 3 B). In other systems, the appetitive phase of goal-directed behaviors has been shown to reflect an internal state of motivation or drive ( Gentry et al., 2019 27. Gentry, R.N. ∙ Schuweiler, D.R. ∙ Roesch, M.R.

Salamone, J.D. ∙ Correa, M. The mysterious motivational functions of mesolimbic dopamine Neuron. 2012; 76 :470-485 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (973) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, in SH flies, CAP neurons are able to evoke not only approach, but also attack, in both sexes. The ability of CAP neurons to control different phases of aggression, in a scalable manner ( Figure 7 E), is reminiscent of the function of VMHvl Esr1+ neurons in mice ( Falkner et al., 2014 23. Falkner, A.L. ∙ Dollar, P. ∙ Perona, P. ... Decoding ventromedial hypothalamic neural activity during male mouse aggression J.

Hashikawa, K. ∙ Hashikawa, Y. ∙ Falkner, A. ... The neural circuits of mating and fighting in male mice Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 38 :27-37 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, our findings raise the question of whether sexually dimorphic attack neurons, analogous to MAN and fpC1, are present in other species. In rodents, males and females attack different body parts of a same-sex intruder ( Blanchard et al., 1975 8. Blanchard, R.J. ∙ Fukunaga, K. ∙ Blanchard, D.C. ... Conspecific aggression in the laboratory rat J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1975; 89 :1204-1209 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sgoifo et al., 1992 66. Sgoifo, A. ∙ Stilli, D. ∙ Musso, E. ... Offensive and defensive bite-target topographies in attacks by lactating rats Aggress. Behav. 1992; 21 :79-89 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ). This topographic difference in biting may reflect sexual dimorphisms in other aspects of rodent aggression that have not yet been fully characterized. Whether this behavioral dimorphism reflects underlying sex differences in the neural control of attack is also unclear. In mice, Esr1/progesterone receptor-expressing (Esr1 + /PR + neurons) glutamatergic neurons in VMHvl have been shown to control both male and maternal aggression ( Hashikawa et al., 2017 29. Hashikawa, K. ∙ Hashikawa, Y. ∙ Tremblay, R. ... Esr1 + cells in the ventromedial hypothalamus control female aggression Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :1580-1590 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2014 46. Lee, H. ∙ Kim, D.W. ∙ Remedios, R. ...

Sexually dimorphic neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus govern mating in both sexes and aggression in males Cell. 2013; 153 :896-909 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, recent single-cell RNA sequencing data have revealed at least 7 distinct transcriptomic cell types among VMHvl Esr1+/PR+ neurons, some of which are male- or female-specific ( Kim et al., 2019 41. Kim, D.W. ∙ Yao, Z. ∙ Graybuck, L.T. ... Multimodal analysis of cell types in a hypothalamic node controlling social behavior Cell. 2019; 179 :713-728.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several of these cells types are specifically activated during aggression, including one that is male-specific. Which transcriptomic cell type(s) is activated during maternal aggression is not yet clear. Thus, whether the same or different cell types regulate male versus female aggression in vertebrates, as well as how different phases of aggressive behavior are regulated in each sex, remains to be determined.

NP2631; dsx-Flp was kindly shared by the Daisuke Yamamoto laboratory (Tohoku University, JP). R26E01-Gal4(attp2)(RRID:BDSC_60510), R26E01-p65AD(attp40)(RRID:BDSC_75740), 20xUAS-IVS-CsChrimson-mVenus(attp2) (RRID:BDSC_55136), 20xUAS-IVS-jGCaMP7b(vk5) (RRID:BDSC_80907), 13xLexAop-IVS-jGCaMP7b(vk5) (RRID: BDSC_80915) were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center (Indiana University).
Stocks and crosses were reared at 25°C and 50% humidity and maintained on a 12hr:12hr light:dark cycle. To keep the fly density consistent across experiments, each cross was set up with 10-12 virgin females and 5-6 males, and was flipped every two days. Experimental flies were collected mostly as virgins on the same day of eclosion and reared in isolation (single-housed (SH) condition; one fly per vial), or in groups (group-housed (GH) condition; ∼20 single-sex flies per vial). For optogenetic experiments, flies were transferred to vials containing retinal food (regular fly food mixed with all-trans-retinal to a final concentration of 0.2 mM) after collection and reared in the dark for 5-6 days. Flies were flipped to fresh retinal food vials one day before a behavioral test.
Several strains were generated for this study: Eb2-Eb5-Gal4s, Eb5-p65AD, Eb5-Gal80, R22F05-Gal80, R22F05-LexADBD, and Eb5-iLexA ( i mproved LexA). Enhancer-bashing fragments, Eb2-Eb5, were PCR-amplified from R60G08 sequence ( Jenett et al., 2012 37. Jenett, A. ∙ Rubin, G.M. ∙ Ngo, T.-T.B. ...

USA. 2008; 105 :9715-9720 Crossref Scopus (701) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cloned into pBPGUw (Addgene #17575) via Gateway and the LR reaction. A detailed description of the cloning strategy can be found in Pfeiffer et al., 2008. Sequences of the primers used for PCR amplification are listed in the key resources table. The Eb5 fragment was subcloned into pBPp65ADZpUw (Addgene #26234) and pBPGAL80Uw-6 (Addgene# 26236) to generate Eb5-p65AD and Eb5-Gal80, respectively. To make the construct R22F05-Gal80, the R22F05 fragment was first amplified from the genomic DNA of the reference strain ( Adams et al., 2000 1. Adams, M.D. ∙ Celniker, S.E. ∙ Holt, R.A. ... The genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster Science. 2000; 287 :2185-2195 Crossref Scopus (5005) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the primers listed in the ‘Janelia_info’ excel sheet ( Jenett et al., 2012 37. Jenett, A. ∙ Rubin, G.M. ∙ Ngo, T.-T.B. ... A GAL4-driver line resource for Drosophila neurobiology Cell Rep. 2012; 2 :991-1001 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (947) PubMed Google Scholar ; downloaded from Bloomington Stock Center webpage: https://bdsc.indiana.edu/stocks/gal4/gal4_janelia.html ) and then cloned into pBPGAL80Uw-6 via Gateway and the LR reaction. To improve the strength of LexA, we fused the activating domain of Gal4, GAD, to the C terminus of nlsLexA::p65 (Addgene #26230) to make pBPnlsLexA::p65::GADUw. The GAD sequence was amplified from the pBPGUw. It has been shown that the expression of a targeted gene can be enhanced by adding additional activating domains to its transcription activator ( Chavez et al., 2016 11. Chavez, A. ∙ Tuttle, M. ∙ Pruitt, B.W. ... Comparison of Cas9 activators in multiple species Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :563-567 Crossref Scopus (359) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Eb5 fragment was then cloned into pBPnlsLexA::p65::GADUw via Gateway and LR reaction to create Eb5-iLexA. All constructs were verified by sequencing. To make the construct R22F05-LexADBD, we first generated the pBPZpnlsLexADBD construct. A nlsLexADBD fragment was PCR-amplified from pattB-nsyb-MKII::nlsLexADBDo (Addgene #64725) and cloned into pBPZpGal4DBD (Addgene #26233) plasmid using KpnI and HindIII sites. The R22F05 enhancer fragment was then cloned into pBPZpnlsLexADBD via Gateway and LR reaction.
Brains or ventral nerve cords of 6-8 day old flies were dissected in cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour at 4°C. After fixation, samples were washed twice with 0.05% PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100) for 15 minutes at room temperature (RT), and incubated in 2% PBST (PBS containing 2% Triton X-100) at RT for 30 minutes. Samples were then blocked in 5% normal goat serum (NGS) solution for 2 hours or overnight at 4°C. After blocking, samples were incubated with the primary antibody solution for two days at 4°C. The dilution ratios for the primary antibodies used in this study were 1:1000 for anti-GFP or anti-RFP and 1:20 for nc82 or anti-NCad. To obtain even labeling of the neuropils, which is critical for subsequent brain registration, samples were transferred to freshly diluted primary antibody solution on the second day of incubation. Afterward, the samples were washed with 0.05% PBST for 30 minutes at 4°C three times and then incubated with the secondary antibody solution for two days at 4°C. All secondary anti-bodies used in this study were diluted 1:1000. Finally, the samples were washed three times with 0.05% PBST for 30 minutes at 4°C and incubated overnight in the mounting media Vectashield (Vectorlabs, Inc.) at 4°C.
Image stacks were obtained using confocal microscopy (Olympus Fluoview FV1000 or FV3000). Representative images illustrating the expression patterns of each driver were chosen from among 6-10 dissected samples. Brain images were first registered to JFRCtemplate2010 ( Jenett et al., 2012 37. Jenett, A. ∙ Rubin, G.M. ∙ Ngo, T.-T.B. ... A GAL4-driver line resource for Drosophila neurobiology Cell Rep. 2012; 2 :991-1001 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (947) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the CMTK registration GUI ( Masse et al., 2012 52. Masse, N.Y. ∙ Cachero, S. ∙ Ostrovsky, A.D. ... A mutual information approach to automate identification of neuronal clusters in Drosophila brain images Front. Neuroinform. 2012; 6 :21 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) and z-projected with maximum intensity under Fiji. To create overlays of two registered brain images, images were pseudocolored and layered in Photoshop.
Details for each of the five different assays performed in this paper are listed below. In general, all experiments were performed in a room maintained at 25°C and 50% humidity. The behavioral chamber is a 12mm-high 16mm-diameter acrylic cylinder with a clear top and floor. The wall and the lid of the chambers were coated with Insect-A-Slip and silicon fluid, respectively. The floor was covered with freshly prepared apple juice agar (2.5% (w/v) sucrose and 2.25% (w/v) agarose in apple juice) and illuminated with an 850nm backlight (SOBL-200x150-850, SmartVision Lights, Muskegon, MI). Flies were tested on the 6 th or 7 th day after eclosion. Flies were introduced into the chambers by gentle mouth pipetting and allowed to settle for at least two minutes before the tests began. Behaviors were recorded at 30fps from the top using a Point Grey Flea3 camera with a long pass IR filter (780 nm, Midwest Optical Systems).
Canton-S males and females were collected on the day of eclosion and reared in the single-housed (one per vial; SH) or group-housed (twenty single-sex flies per vial; GH) condition. In each behavior chamber, we paired same-sex flies from different vials to avoid the influence of prior life history, e.g., a GH male from the first vial 1 was paired with a GH male from the second vial. Interactions were recorded for 10 minutes.
Canton-S males and females were collected on the day of eclosion and reared in group-housed condition until the test day (the 6 th day after eclosion). Same-sex flies were paired in the chambers with or without a freshly prepared banana chunk (∼2mm 3 ) in the center as the food resource, where indicated.
Experimental flies were group-housed and raised on retinal food in the dark until the test day. Flies were transferred to fresh vials one day before the experiment. A detailed description of the photostimulation setup can be found in Inagaki et al. (2014) 35. Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Jung, Y. ∙ Hoopfer, E.D. ... Optogenetic control of Drosophila using a red-shifted channelrhodopsin reveals experience-dependent influences on courtship Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :325-332 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, a high-powered 655nm LED was mounted ∼8cm above the chamber at a 24° angle to provide photostimulation at various intensities and frequencies. With the exception of the stimulation titration experiments shown in Figure 4 , 10 Hz and 5Hz pulsed light with a maximum intensity = 0.62 μW/mm 2 were used to activate neurons in males and females, respectively. The stimulation protocol included a 30 s baseline activity recording, two 30 s stimulation blocks separated by a 30 s interstimulation interval, and a 30 s post-stimulation period. Behaviors observed during experiments were present as the average from two stimulation blocks. For the stimulation titration experiment shown in Figure 4 A, the same set of experimental flies were tested with 5 different intensities of photostimulation (0.1-0.62 μW/mm 2 ) using the same stimulation paradigm. The order of the intensity was randomly applied and each experiment was followed by a 5min interval to allow the experimental flies to recover to their baseline activity. Data were collected from two independent sets of experimental flies.
The chamber used was a 12mm-high cylinder with a 16mm diameter. The two targets were mounted at the opposite sides of the floor, ∼10mm apart using a UV glue tool kit (Bondic). For Figure 3 Bi, the left and the right targets were a fly (same-sex as the tester) and a fly-size magnet (K&J Magnetics, Pipersville, PA; Cylinder 1/16”x1/16,” D11-N52), respectively. The fly targets were 5-6-day old Canton-S virgin males or females frozen at −80°C for 20 minutes immediately before the experiment. For Figure 3 Bii, the male and the female fly targets were mounted at the left and the right sides of the chamber, respectively. For Figure 3 Biii, the left and right targets were both females. Testers were introduced into the chamber from the top and were allowed to freely explore the arena and the targets for two minutes before the standard optogenetic stimulation (30 s pre-stimulation period followed by 30 s 655nm photostimulation) was applied. The preference index was calculated as follows, p r e f e r e n c e i n d e x = 𝑛 l e f t − 𝑛 r i g h t 𝑛 l e f t + 𝑛 r i g h t , where n left is the number of approach bouts toward the left target and n right is the number of approach bouts toward the right target.
The inwardly-rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 was expressed in CAP ( Figure 3 C), MAP ( Figures 5 B and 5C), fpC1 ( Figures 6 D and 6E), Tk ( Figure S7 A), and Eb5 ( Figure S7 B) neurons to test how silencing these neurons affects naturally- or artificially-induced aggression. Experimental flies were single-housed for six days under a normal 12hr-light: 12hr-dark cycle to naturally enhance aggressiveness ( Figures 3 C, 5 B, and 6 D). For behavioral epistasis experiments where fighting was optogenetically induced experimental flies were group-housed and reared in dark ( Figures 5 C, 6 E, and S7 ).
GH > GH flies and GH > SH testers were collected on the same day. Both fly groups were reared in the GH condition for the first three days. On the fourth day, the control (GH > GH) flies were transferred to a new vial and maintained in groups whereas the testers (GH > SH) were isolated individually; both groups were maintained for an additional 3 days. The optogenetic stimulation experiments were done on the morning of the 7 th day. Here we purposely shortened the length of social isolation from six days (our standard procedure) ( Wang et al., 2008 74. Wang, L. ∙ Dankert, H. ∙ Perona, P. ... A common genetic target for environmental and heritable influences on aggressiveness in Drosophila Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :5657-5663 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ) to three days, in order to avoid a ceiling effect on aggression.
Six-day old experimental flies were briefly anesthetized on ice and head-fixed on a customized holder with the UV glue in their normal standing posture. The top of the fly head was immersed in fly saline (103mM NaCl, 3mM KCl, 5mM N-Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid, 8mM trehalose, 10mM glucose, 26mM NaHCO 3 , 1mM NaH2PO 4 , 4mM MgCl2, 1.5mM CaCl2; pH7.25; 270-275mOsm) ( Hong and Wilson, 2015 31. Hong, E.J. ∙ Wilson, R.I. Simultaneous encoding of odors by channels with diverse sensitivity to inhibition Neuron. 2015; 85 :573-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). A piece of cuticle (∼350 μm by 350 μm) was removed from the posterior side of the head capsule to create an imaging window. After surgery, the experimental fly was placed under a 0.8 numerical aperture (NA) 40x objective (LUMPLFLN40XW, Olympus) and habituated for at least 5 minutes. The optical setup for two-photon imaging with optogenetic activation was as described in Inagaki et al. (2014) 35. Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Jung, Y. ∙ Hoopfer, E.D. ... Optogenetic control of Drosophila using a red-shifted channelrhodopsin reveals experience-dependent influences on courtship Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :325-332 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, imaging was performed using a custom-modified Ultima two-photon laser scanning microscope (Bruker). 920nm ultrafast light pulses for exciting GCaMP was provided by a Chameleon Ultra II Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent) and the GCaMP signals were detected by photomultiplier-tubes (Hamamatsu). Images were acquired at 256x256 pixel resolution and 2 frames per second. Chrimson activation was provided by a fiber-coupled 660nm LED (M660F1, Thorlabs), powered by a 1-channel LED driver with pulse modulation (DC2100, Thorlabs) and delivered through an optical fiber (200μm in diameter, 0.39NA, M75L01, Thorlabs) placed above the imaging window at a ∼45° angle and ∼500μm in distance. The stimulation paradigm included a 20 s baseline, 5 s photo-stimulation at the designated frequency (5-50Hz) and intensity (0-34.6 μW), and a 35 s post-stimulation period.
To trace the morphologies of different Eb5 cell classes, photoactivatable-GFP (PA-GFP) ( Datta et al., 2008 18. Datta, S.R. ∙ Vasconcelos, M.L. ∙ Ruta, V. ... The Drosophila pheromone cVA activates a sexually dimorphic neural circuit Nature. 2008; 452 :473-477 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ruta et al., 2010 63. Ruta, V. ∙ Datta, S.R. ∙ Vasconcelos, M.L. ... A dimorphic pheromone circuit in Drosophila from sensory input to descending output Nature. 2010; 468 :686-690 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) was expressed by Eb5-Gal4 (attp2) in both sexes. The experimental preparation was similar to functional imaging experiments except that the photoactivation was provided by 710 nm ultrafast light pulses using the two-photon microscope. The photoactivation was first localized to the cell body of the targeted neuron and, after the diffusion of the activated PA-GFP, applied subsequently to the terminus of the labeled segments to extend the labeling. Photoactivation cycles were separated by 10min intervals to allow the spread of activated PA-GFP and the entire experiment typically lasted 1.5-2 hours for each cell. Image stacks were taken at 1024x1024 pixel resolution. For the purpose of clarity, the labeled neuron was traced with Simple Neurite Tracer plugins using Fiji to mask the background fluorescence. The morphology of each cell class was confirmed with at least two biological replicates.
Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB. All behavioral data were compared using nonparametric tests. The n number for each experiment is indicated in the figures and listed in Table S3 , along with the statistical method used for each comparison, the p-value , and the test scores. Briefly, Mann-Whitney U-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for between and within-group comparisons, respectively. The cutoff for significance was set as an α < 0.05. The central mark of each boxplot indicates the median and the bottom and top are the 25 th and the 75 th percentiles, respectively.
Behavioral videos were tracked with Caltech FlyTracker to determine the positions, the velocities, and the postures of the experimental flies in 30 fps recordings ( Eyjolfsdottir et al., 2014 22. Eyjolfsdottir, E. ∙ Branson, S. ∙ Burgos-Artizzu, X.P. ... Detecting social actions of fruit flies Computer Vision-ECCV 2014. Lecture Notes in Computer Science Springer, Fleet, D. ∙ Pajdla, T. ∙ Schiele, B. ... (Editors) 8690. 2014; 772-787 Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar ). These tracking data were used by behavioral classifiers developed with the Janelia Automatic Animal Behavior Annotator (JAABA) ( Kabra et al., 2013 40. Kabra, M. ∙ Robie, A.A. ∙ Rivera-Alba, M. ... JAABA: interactive machine learning for automatic annotation of animal behavior Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :64-67 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ) to determine the behavioral bouts. Naturally occurring fighting between single-housed male-male or female-female wild-type pairs were used to train the classifiers. We used the following criteria to train the classifiers for approach, lunge, and headbutt, separately: An approach bout starts when the two flies are at a distance (at least one fly-body length(∼3mm) apart). The behaving fly first orients toward the target fly, moves forward with acceleration, and finally makes contact with the target (e.g., their legs are crossing or their bodies touching). We used the same approach classifier for detecting male and female approach bouts, and classifier performance was comparable between the two sexes ( Figure S1 D). We considered lunging and headbutting as short-distance behaviors. The behaving fly only lunges or headbutts when the target fly is in close proximity. Also, lunging and headbutting are very brief actions whereas the duration of approach may vary depending on the distance and the velocity of the behaving fly. A lunge bout begins when the behaving fly raises its front legs and its upper body and “slams down” onto the target fly. We consider lunging as a male-specific behavior because it was only observed during male fights in our experiments; application of the automated lunge classifier to videos of female fights yielded only false positives. A headbutt bout was scored when the behaving fly lashed out in a thrust with its head, toward the target. The classifier performance is listed in Table S2 . Behavioral bouts annotated by the classifiers were manually curated to eliminate false-positives and false-negatives in all experiments.
Same-size region of interests (ROIs) were manually drawn over the cell bodies of targeted neurons and the GCaMP fluorescence in the ROIs was measured using the ROI manager in Fiji software. The mean of the fluorescence intensity during the first 20 s of image acquisition was used as the baseline fluorescence (F) to calculate the ΔF/F. The ΔF/F was then normalized to the maximum peak value of fluorescence detected within the full dataset that combined data from all genotypes involved, and is presented as ΔF/F (%). The mean of ΔF/F during the indicated periods (5 s before, during, and after photo-stimulation) was calculated and compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank (WSR) test and Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test in MATLAB. Specifically, MWU was used for between-genotype comparison whereas WSR was used for within-genotype pre-stimulation (Pre-stim) versus during stimulation (Stim) comparisons. The cutoff for significance was set as α < 0.05. Each data point represents one cell per fly. For each genotype, the testing flies were collected from two independent crosses to avoid sampling bias.
