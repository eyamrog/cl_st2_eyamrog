Title: Strain-level fitness in the gut microbiome is an emergent property of glycans and a single metabolite


Abstract: Summary

The human gut microbiota resides within a diverse chemical environment challenging our ability to understand the forces shaping this ecosystem. Here, we reveal that fitness of the Bacteroidales, the dominant order of bacteria in the human gut, is an emergent property of glycans and one specific metabolite, butyrate. Distinct sugars serve as strain-variable fitness switches activating context-dependent inhibitory functions of butyrate. Differential fitness effects of butyrate within the Bacteroides are mediated by species-level variation in Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity and nucleotide polymorphisms regulating an Acyl-CoA transferase. Using in vivo multi-omic profiles, we demonstrate Bacteroides fitness in the human gut is associated together, but not independently, with Acyl-CoA transferase expression and butyrate. Our data reveal that each strain of the Bacteroides exists within a unique fitness landscape based on the interaction of chemical components unpredictable by the effect of each part alone mediated by flexibility in the core genome.

Section: Introduction

The gut microbiome is composed of an enormous magnitude and diversity of microorganisms residing in a chemically and molecularly complex ecosystem. Increasing evidence has highlighted the critical role of individual species’ and strains’ roles of the microbiome in human health, such as in protection from infection ( Leshem et al., 2020 37.

Given the widespread impact of the microbiome on human health, there is an imperative to understand the forces that shape the microbiome, in particular at the community and strain level ( Ferreiro et al., 2018 15.

Carbohydrates are a major factor shaping the composition of the gut microbiome and mediate many of the effects of the microbiome on human health ( Koropatkin et al., 2012 34.

Sugars such as dietary glycans are critical determinants of the fitness of the Bacteroidales, the predominant order of bacteria in the gut ( Arumugam et al., 2011 1.

The Bacteroidales are central to host health and disease, with specific Bacteroidales species and strains playing protective and pathogenic roles in human physiology and disease ( Mazmanian et al., 2008 46.

Survival of the Bacteroidales in the mammalian gut is dependent on the ability of each individual member to utilize and compete for the diverse array of glycans in the intestine ( Patnode et al., 2019 52.

In addition to the wide range of carbohydrates, the gut ecosystem is rich in chemical and metabolic diversity ( Donia and Fischbach, 2015 11. Donia, M.S. ∙ Fischbach, M.A. HUMAN MICROBIOTA. Small molecules from the human microbiota Science. 2015; 349 :1254766 Crossref Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ; Integrative HMP (iHMP) Research Network Consortium, 2019 24. Integrative HMP (iHMP) Research Network Consortium The Integrative Human Microbiome Project Nature. 2019; 569 :641-648 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ). The chemical and metabolic composition of the gut, derived from components of diet as well as microbial and host metabolism, has important roles in human health ( Sonnenburg and Bäckhed, 2016 67. Sonnenburg, J.L. ∙ Bäckhed, F. Diet-microbiota interactions as moderators of human metabolism Nature. 2016; 535 :56-64 Crossref Scopus (1526) PubMed Google Scholar ). One class of small molecules, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), primary metabolites of host and microbial metabolism, is both abundant and dynamic across health and disease. SCFAs are critical to host activities from colonic epithelial metabolism and homeostasis, immunoregulation, cancer, and the gut-brain axis ( Koh et al., 2016 30. Koh, A. ∙ De Vadder, F. ∙ Kovatcheva-Datchary, P. ... From Dietary Fiber to Host Physiology: Short-Chain Fatty Acids as Key Bacterial Metabolites Cell. 2016; 165 :1332-1345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4025) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rooks and Garrett, 2016 57. Rooks, M.G. ∙ Garrett, W.S. Gut microbiota, metabolites and host immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16 :341-352 Crossref Scopus (2193) PubMed Google Scholar ). The impact of the chemical and metabolite diversity of the intestinal ecosystem on the gut microbiome is largely unknown.
Here, we reveal that a microbial-derived small molecule, butyrate, is a context-dependent inhibitor of the human gut Bacteroidales. We find that fitness of Bacteroidales is a function of sugars and butyrate, whereby butyrate acts as a fitness-switch dependent on which specific sugar is utilized. Individual strains have idiosyncratic butyrate fitness switches across diverse sugars. The mechanism of species- and sugar-dependent inhibitory effects of butyrate is genetic variation in the function and regulation of Acyl-CoA metabolism within the Bacteroides . Our work demonstrates that strain-level fitness of the dominant order of bacteria in the human gut is an emergent property of specific dietary glycans and one microbial-derived small molecule butyrate, mediated by enzymatic and transcriptional regulatory variation in the core genome.

Section: Results

As abundant gut ecological commodities, we asked if the primary metabolite SCFAs affected the fitness of the Bacteroidales ( Figure 1 ). We assayed a panel of SCFAs prevalent in the human gut ( Koh et al., 2016 30. Koh, A. ∙ De Vadder, F. ∙ Kovatcheva-Datchary, P. ... From Dietary Fiber to Host Physiology: Short-Chain Fatty Acids as Key Bacterial Metabolites Cell. 2016; 165 :1332-1345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4025) PubMed Google Scholar ) composed of a range of length (1–4 carbons), isomerization, and number of carboxylic acids groups (1 or 2) at physiological concentrations for effects on growth of a panel of 7 species of the Bacteroidales. Most SCFAs had either no or minimal effects on the Bacteroidales. However, the C4-monocarboxylated SCFA butyrate, exclusively produced by microbes ( Lavelle and Sokol, 2020 36. Lavelle, A. ∙ Sokol, H. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites as key actors in inflammatory bowel disease Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2020; 17 :223-237 Crossref Scopus (1009) PubMed Google Scholar ), was found to be highly growth inhibitory to five of the seven Bacteroidales species tested ( B. eggerthi , Be ; B. ovatus , Bo ; B. uniformis , Bu ; B. vulgatus , Bv ; Parabacteroides merdae , Pm ), without notable effects on two ( B. fragilis , Bf ; B. thetaiotaomicron , Bt ). Growth inhibition was specific to butyrate as compared to minimal fitness effects of the C3-monocarboxylated SCFA, propionate, or the C4-dicarboxylated SCFA, succinate.
We next examined the fitness effects of butyrate on an expanded collection of 53 human gut Bacteroidales isolates, encompassing multiple strains within a species ( Figure 2 A). Within the species Bo and Bv , for example, Bo CL03 and Bv CL09 strains were resistant to butyrate, while Bo ATCC 8483 and Bv ATCC 8482 strains were sensitive ( Figure 2 A). Together, these results identified the specific microbial metabolite butyrate as inhibitory to the Bacteroidales at the species and strain level.
The Bacteroidales use a diverse range of monosaccharides for energy to compete within the mammalian intestine ( Koropatkin et al., 2012 34. Koropatkin, N.M. ∙ Cameron, E.A. ∙ Martens, E.C. How glycan metabolism shapes the human gut microbiota Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10 :323-335 Crossref Scopus (1026) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next assayed whether Bacteroidales susceptibility to butyrate was robust to a range of monosaccharides. These experiments yielded the striking finding that the inhibitory activity of butyrate was conditional on the monosaccharide utilized ( Figure 2 ). For example, strains highly resistant to butyrate when grown in glucose (Glc) as the sole carbon source were rendered severely sensitive when utilizing N -Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ( Figures 2 A and 2B). This inhibitory property was specific to butyrate, as growth in GalNAc did not render Bacteroidales strains sensitive to other SCFAs ( Figure S1 A). The differential inhibitory effects of butyrate across strains and sugars were not associated with growth rate ( Figure S1 B). Inhibition by butyrate was observed at concentrations as low as 2 mM ( Figure S1 C) within the physiological range of butyrate in the mammalian gut ( Cummings et al., 1987 9. Cummings, J.H. ∙ Pomare, E.W. ∙ Branch, W.J. ... Short chain fatty acids in human large intestine, portal, hepatic and venous blood Gut. 1987; 28 :1221-1227 Crossref Scopus (2327) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koh et al., 2016 30. Koh, A. ∙ De Vadder, F. ∙ Kovatcheva-Datchary, P. ... From Dietary Fiber to Host Physiology: Short-Chain Fatty Acids as Key Bacterial Metabolites Cell. 2016; 165 :1332-1345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4025) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reveal a hierarchy of strength of monosaccharides to tune fitness effects of butyrate: Glc, fructose (Fru) and mannose (Man) render most Bacteroidales resistant to butyrate, N -Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose (Gal) and xylose (Xyl) mediate intermediate sensitivity, and rhamnose, ribose, and GalNAc render strains highly sensitive to butyrate (e.g., Bt VPI-5482) ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Importantly, we observed variation in the hierarchical strength of individual monosaccharides to tune butyrate-mediated Bacteroides fitness. For example, B. fragilis 9343 is highly resistant to butyrate in GlcNAc but highly sensitive in Xyl, whereas B. ovatus CL03 is substantially more resistant to butyrate in Xyl than in GlcNAc ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Together, these data reveal that butyrate interacts with individual monosaccharides on the fitness of the Bacteroidales. These interactions occur as a function of context, whereby the strength of distinct sugars differentially tunes butyrate-mediated fitness (sugar-strength), and as a function of intrinsic properties of the microbe in the same sugar, whereby specific strains are differentially resistant to butyrate (strain-strength).
While monosaccharides are the monomeric terminal products entering central metabolism, dietary oligomeric and polymeric glycans (which arrive undigested to the colon as microbiota-accessible carbohydrates; MACs) ( Sonnenburg and Bäckhed, 2016 67. Sonnenburg, J.L. ∙ Bäckhed, F. Diet-microbiota interactions as moderators of human metabolism Nature. 2016; 535 :56-64 Crossref Scopus (1526) PubMed Google Scholar ) are critical forms of glycan utilized by the Bacteroides and are major drivers of Bacteroides composition ( Patnode et al., 2019 52. Patnode, M.L. ∙ Beller, Z.W. ∙ Han, N.D. ... Interspecies Competition Impacts Targeted Manipulation of Human Gut Bacteria by Fiber-Derived Glycans Cell. 2019; 179 :59-73.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sonnenburg et al., 2010 68. Sonnenburg, E.D. ∙ Zheng, H. ∙ Joglekar, P. ... Specificity of polysaccharide use in intestinal bacteroides species determines diet-induced microbiota alterations Cell. 2010; 141 :1241-1252 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ). Across a panel of 7 distinct dietary glycans there was a range of strain-level variation in susceptibility to butyrate ( Figure S1 D). Among B. fragilis species, utilizers of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) critical for colonizing the infant gut ( Charbonneau et al., 2016 7. Charbonneau, M.R. ∙ Blanton, L.V. ∙ DiGiulio, D.B. ... A microbial perspective of human developmental biology Nature. 2016; 535 :48-55 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ; Marcobal et al., 2011 44. Marcobal, A. ∙ Barboza, M. ∙ Sonnenburg, E.D. ... Bacteroides in the infant gut consume milk oligosaccharides via mucus-utilization pathways Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 10 :507-514 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed a within-species, strain-level hierarchical strength of HMOs to tune butyrate-mediated fitness with strength increasing from 3-SL to LnNT to 2-FL ( Figure 2 C). As exemplified by Bo CL03, distinct plant- and animal-derived glycans can control the fitness effects of butyrate depending on which MAC is being utilized ( Figure 2 D). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that depending on which MAC among the glycan diversity of the human diet composed of milk, plant, and animal glycans a given Bacteroides strain utilizes, there is a dynamic strain-specific range of fitness effects of butyrate.
Comparing the fitness effects of Bacteroides strains for monosaccharides and MACs revealed a striking discordance of the inhibitory effects of butyrate for specific polymers and the monomers of which the glycan is composed (cognate polymer-monomer pairs). For some MACs, there was concordance between cognate polymer-monomer pairs, such as Bacteroides members resistant to butyrate in the glucan pullulan and the fructan levan, which also demonstrated resistance to butyrate in Glc or Fru monomers ( Figures 2 A, 2B, 2D, and S1 B). However, for certain polymers, we observed phenotypic discordance in the effects of butyrate for polymer-monomer pairs. For example, Bo CL03 was highly resistant to butyrate in the monomers arabinose, Gal, Glc, and Man but highly sensitive to butyrate in cognate heteropolymers, arabinogalactan, or glucomannan ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and 2D). Sensitivity to butyrate in these polymers was not a property of the individual monomers of these heteropolymers in combination ( Figure S1 E).
We next analyzed the inhibitory function of butyrate for Bacteroides species in cognate pairs of monomer and homo- and hetero-dimers. Bo CL03, resistant to butyrate in Glc and Fru, was also resistant in the Glc homodimer maltose (α1,4) and the Glc-Fru heterodimer sucrose (α1,β2) ( Figure 2 E). However, this strain was highly sensitive to butyrate in the Glc homodimers cellobiose (β1,4) and the Glc-Fru heterodimer palatinose (α1,6) ( Figure 2 E). Furthermore, we find species-level variation in discordance of butyrate-mediated fitness between monomers and dimers. B. xylanisolvens ( Bx ) CL03 was resistant to butyrate in Glc but sensitive in all Glc homodimers including cellobiose ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, Bu CL03 was resistant to butyrate in maltose and cellobiose ( Figure 2 E). Together, these results demonstrate species-level properties of glycan components independent of their overall combination in mediating the fitness effects of butyrate on the Bacteroides .
The composition of Bacteroides communities is driven by competition based on utilization of dietary glycans ( Patnode et al., 2019 52. Patnode, M.L. ∙ Beller, Z.W. ∙ Han, N.D. ... Interspecies Competition Impacts Targeted Manipulation of Human Gut Bacteria by Fiber-Derived Glycans Cell. 2019; 179 :59-73.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sonnenburg et al., 2010 68. Sonnenburg, E.D. ∙ Zheng, H. ∙ Joglekar, P. ... Specificity of polysaccharide use in intestinal bacteroides species determines diet-induced microbiota alterations Cell. 2010; 141 :1241-1252 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings suggested that the composition of Bacteroides communities could be a property of species- and glycan-specific fitness as a function of both the specific glycan and butyrate. To determine if butyrate impacts the relative abundance of Bacteroides species in vivo , we colonized germ-free mice that were fed diets with either one or both of two prebiotic and health-relevant MACs, inulin and pectin ( Koh et al., 2016 30. Koh, A. ∙ De Vadder, F. ∙ Kovatcheva-Datchary, P. ... From Dietary Fiber to Host Physiology: Short-Chain Fatty Acids as Key Bacterial Metabolites Cell. 2016; 165 :1332-1345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4025) PubMed Google Scholar ), as the sole dietary glycan with a community of four Bacteroides species demonstrating distinct fitness effects of butyrate as a function of inulin and pectin in vitro ( Figure 2 F). Administration of butyrate led to significant impact on the fitness of each of the four species of Bacteroides in mice fed both dietary glycans ( Figure 2 G). With the exception of Bc , the fitness effects of butyrate on each Bacteroides species were glycan specific, with significant differences of the impact of butyrate on each Bacteroides species fitness depending on the specific dietary glycan ( Figure 2 G) correlating with the glycan-specific fitness effects of butyrate on each species in vitro . Together, these experiments demonstrate both that butyrate can impact the relative fitness of Bacteroides in vivo and impact species-level fitness in a glycan-dependent manner.
We next sought to determine the mechanistic basis of the interaction between butyrate and sugars on Bacteroides species-level fitness. To begin, we investigated the global transcriptional responses via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the butyrate-resistant B. thetaiotaomicron VPI 5482 (herein Bt ) and the butyrate-sensitive B. vulgatus ATCC 8482 (herein Bv ) in Glc after a short pulse with different SCFAs ( Table S2 ). Few genes were specifically regulated by butyrate in either strain, with the notable exception of upregulation in Bt of genes involved in biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) ( ilv and leu operons) ( Figures 3 A and S2 A). In both species, all SCFAs downregulated NADH-dehydrogenase genes ( Figure 3 A), which have been shown to be upregulated in response to intracellular acidification in bacteria ( Kannan et al., 2008 28. Kannan, G. ∙ Wilks, J.C. ∙ Fitzgerald, D.M. ... Rapid acid treatment of Escherichia coli: transcriptomic response and recovery BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8 :37 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that species-specific resistance was not a result of differential intracellular acidification by butyrate. Exposure to SCFAs did not result in intracellular acidification in the butyrate-sensitive Bv , nor did we observe differences in intracellular pH between inhibitory (butyrate) or non-inhibitory SCFAs (acetate or succinate) ( Figure S2 B). To determine the transcriptional response to butyrate as a function of sugar strength, we compared transcriptional responses of Bv to butyrate when grown in Glc, GlcNAc, Gal, or Xyl, which have increasing tuning of butyrate sensitivity ( Table S2 ). Across sugars there was greater induction of stress-response genes such as Hsp family members and GroES with increasing sugar strength ( Figure 3 B). This suggests that butyrate caused a different degree of cellular stress depending on which sugar was being utilized. Indeed, we found differential cell membrane damage by butyrate dependent on sugar, with minimal membrane damage and bacteriostatic effect of butyrate in Glc in Bv , but not Bt other SCFAs, and severe membrane damage and subsequent cell death after treatment with butyrate in Gal ( Figures 3 C, 3D, and S2 C). Together, these results demonstrate that butyrate induces species-specific cellular stress responses, membrane damage, and cell death in the Bacteroides and that the strength of cellular stress and bacteriostatic versus bactericidal function is sugar dependent.
To dissect the mechanism by which butyrate is differentially inhibitory to the Bacteroides , we constructed a genome-wide transposon (Tn) mutagenesis library of Bt to identify the genetic determinants of butyrate resistance in Bt which demonstrates high level resistance to butyrate. Tn insertion in the BT_3942 gene conferred the greatest fitness disadvantage in butyrate among 14 genes with significant loss of fitness ( Figure 4 A). BT_3942 is an Acyl-coenzyme A (Acyl-CoA) thioesterase, predicted to hydrolyze Acyl-CoAs into free fatty acyl groups and coenzyme A (CoA) ( Figure 4 B). Targeted non-polar deletion of BT_3942 demonstrated sensitivity to butyrate at concentrations as low as 2 mM ( Figure S3 A) and in complex media with variable sugar concentration ( Figure S3 B). Complementation of Bt Δ3942 confirmed that this Acyl-CoA thioesterase gene confers resistance to butyrate ( Figure 4 C). Resistance was specific to butyrate as Bt Δ3942 did not become sensitive to other SCFAs ( Figure S3 C). Together, these data demonstrate that resistance to butyrate in Bt is mediated by an Acyl-CoA thioesterase.
To identify the genetic determinants that confer butyrate sensitivity in Bv , which demonstrates high sensitivity to butyrate, we performed transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) in Bv ( Table S3 ). Tn insertion in the genes BVU_1163 and BVU_1164, which compose an operon, generated the greatest gain of resistance to butyrate among 91 genes with significant gain of resistance phenotype ( Figures 4 D and 4E). BVU_1163 is annotated as a putative Acyl-CoA transferase predicted to reversibly transfer CoAs from Acyl-CoAs to acetate ( Figure 4 E). Enzymatic assays with recombinant protein BVU_1163 revealed transferase activity for propionyl, butyryl, and succinyl-CoA substrates, but not the medium-chain hexanoyl-CoA ( Figure S3 D). Deletion of BVU_1163 ( Bv Δ1163) rendered Bv partially resistant to butyrate in Glc, which was phenotypically complemented by expression of BVU_1163 ( Figure 4 F). These findings demonstrate that sensitivity to butyrate in Bv is mediated by an Acyl-CoA transferase. Expression of Acyl-CoA thioesterase BT_3942 conferred resistance to the naturally sensitive Bv , while expression of the Acyl-CoA transferase BVU_1163 conferred sensitivity in the naturally resistant Bt , demonstrating a common, opposing pathway of Acyl-CoA metabolism susceptibility in these two strains ( Figure 4 F). Together, our data demonstrate that Acyl-CoA metabolism acts in metabolic defense to the inhibitory effects of butyrate in the Bacteroides .
To determine if extracellular butyrate is taken up and converted metabolically by the Bacteroides , we pulsed naturally resistant Bt and naturally sensitive Bv with 13 C butyrate and measured 13 C labeling of intracellular Acyl-CoA metabolites in bacterial lysates after 30 min. 13 C labels were present in the forms of butyryl-CoA and to a lesser extent, acetyl-CoA, but not propionyl CoA in both Bt and Bv with notably a greater extent of 13 C-incorporation into butyryl-CoA in Bv ( Figures 4 G and S3 E).
We next measured Acyl-CoA and free CoA pools after butyrate pulse yet before growth inhibition ( Figure S3 F) in Bt wild type (WT) and the butyrate-sensitive isogenic mutant Bt Δ 3942 as well as in Bv WT and the partially butyrate-resistant isogenic mutant Bv Δ1163. In Bt WT, there was no significant change after butyrate pulse in acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, or free CoA but moderate yet significant accumulation of butyryl-CoA (2-fold) ( Figures 4 H and S3 G). In Bv WT, butyrate pulse led to a greater increase in butyryl-CoA levels compared to Bt and depletion of acetyl-CoA, propionyl CoA, and free CoA ( Figures 4 H and S3 E). There was significant accumulation of butyryl-CoA in the butyrate-sensitive Bt Δ 3942 compared to Bt WT and depletion of acetyl-CoA and CoA, but not of propionyl-CoA ( Figures 4 H and S3 G). Accumulation of butyryl-CoA as a result of BT_3942 deletion was confirmed by 13 C butyrate tracing ( Figure 4 G). Propionyl-CoA levels were unchanged between Bv WT and Bv Δ 1163 ( Figure 4 H). Bv Δ1163, despite being partially sensitive to butyrate, had higher levels of acetyl-CoA after butyrate pulse then that of healthy Bv WT in the absence of butyrate ( Figure 4 H). Bv Δ1163 demonstrated significantly less accumulation of butyryl-CoA after butyrate pulse compared to Bv WT ( Figures 4 H and S3 G). Decreased accumulation of butyryl-CoA as a result of BVU_1163 deletion was confirmed by 13 C butyrate tracing ( Figure 4 G). Together, these data demonstrate that extracellular butyrate is taken up by Bacteroides and metabolized predominantly into butyryl-CoA, differentially impacts Acyl-CoA pools among Bacteroides species and as a function of Acyl-CoA thioesterase and Acyl-CoA transferase activity, and that butyryl-CoA accumulation correlates with the toxic effects of butyrate.
In the absence of the Acyl-CoA transferase, Bv Δ1163 is partially resistant to butyrate in Glc but remains sensitive in Gal ( Figure S4 A), suggesting the existence of mechanisms in addition to the Acyl-CoA transferase BVU_1163 that mediate sugar-specific sensitivity to butyrate. To gain insight into the mechanism by which different sugars tune Bacteroides fitness to butyrate, we performed a synthetic fitness Tn-seq in Bv Δ1163 in Gal ( Table S3 ). Four of the top five genes in which insertions leading to the greatest gain of fitness to butyrate in Gal occurred in two operons, BVU_2720/2719 and BVU_0575/0574 ( Figure 5 A). Remarkably, both BVU_0574 and BVU_2719 are predicted Acyl-CoA synthetases ( Figure 5 B). Notably, BVU_2719 (and the Bt homolog, BT_2782) was induced to a greater extent in Gal compared to Glc in both Bv and Bt and is repressed by butyrate in Bv in Gal ( Figure S4 B). Deletion of the BVU_0574 or BVU_2719 resulted in full resistance to butyrate in Glc and Gal in the Bv Δ1163 background but not in Bv WT background ( Figure 5 C). The Acyl-CoA synthetases did not have the same synergistic strength, as Bv Δ1163 Δ2719 showed greater resistance to butyrate in Gal compared with B v Δ1163 Δ0574 ( Figure 5 C). Importantly, butyrate pulse in the B v Δ1163 Δ0574 strain did not result in accumulation of butyryl-CoA, consistent with full resistance to butyrate ( Figure S4 C).
To address genetic mechanisms mediating the fitness effects of butyrate at the strain-level, we performed Tn-seq in Bv CL09 which is resistant to butyrate in Glc but sensitive in Gal and Xyl ( Figures 2 A and 2B) after selection in Gal in the presence of butyrate ( Table S3 ; Figure S4 D). This revealed gain-of-resistance insertions in AGXZ_01713 (Acyl-CoA transferase BVU_1163) and AGXZ_02243 and AGXZ_00341 (each of the Acyl-CoA synthetases, BVU_0574 and BVU_2719), each of which is 100% identical by amino acid (AA) between Bv ATCC and Bv CL09 ( Table S3 ; Figure S4 D). In Bv CL09, deletion of BVU_1163 or BVU_2719 conferred resistance to butyrate in Gal but not Xyl ( Figure S4 E). Deletion of both BVU_1163 and BVU_2719 resulted in resistance to butyrate in Xyl ( Figure S4 E). Together, these data demonstrate that synergy in Acyl-CoA metabolic genes mediates the hierarchical strength of sugars on fitness effects of butyrate in the Bacteroides at the species and strain level.
Tn-seq in butyrate-resistant Bt revealed that 7 of the 14 genes with significant loss of resistance to butyrate belonged to the ilv (4 of 5 genes) and leu (3 of 5 genes) operon ( Figures 4 A and S4 F), many of which were upregulated in Glc compared to Gal ( Table S4 ). We reasoned that the BCAAs, end products of biosynthesis mediated by ilv and leu operons, might control resistance to butyrate in Bt . Remarkably, isoleucine (Ile), but not leucine (Leu) or valine (Val), conferred resistance to butyrate in Bt Δ3942 and Bv in Glc ( Figure 5 D) but not in Gal ( Figure 5 E). However, in Bv Δ1163, Ile conferred resistance to butyrate in Gal ( Figure 5 E). In Bv Δ1163 Δ0574, but not Bv Δ1163, Leu conferred resistance to butyrate in Gal ( Figure 5 E). Unexpectedly, in Bv Δ1163 Δ2719, which is resistant to butyrate in Glc and Gal, we observed that the addition of Val resulted in reversal of resistance, rendering this mutant sensitive to butyrate via a pathway counteracted by Ile ( Figure 5 E). We found examples of sugar-specific BCAA tuning in natural strains ( Figure 5 F) analogous to each Bv mutant of Acyl-CoA metabolism ( Figure 5 E). For example, Ile, but not Leu, conferred resistance in Gal in Be DSM (analogous to Bv Δ1163 in Gal), while Leu, but not Val, was able to confer resistance to butyrate in Glc (analogous to Bv Δ1163 Δ0574 in Gal). Addition of Val resulted in reversal of resistance in B. dorei 9-1-6 (analogous to Bv Δ1163 Δ2719) but not in Bx 1-1-30 ( Figure 5 F). These results suggest that Bacteroides species have a spectrum of Acyl-CoA metabolic states tunable by specific sugars and distinct BCAAs.
We next sought to determine the mechanism of species-level variation of the fitness effects of butyrate among the Bacteroides . Comparison of AA sequences revealed that the predicted Acyl-CoA thioesterase BT_3942 was poorly conserved among the Bacteroides ( Figure S5 A), sharing only 51% AA identity with a homolog BVU_0767 from butyrate-sensitive Bv ( Figures 6 A and S5 B). Expression of BT_3942, but not BVU_0767, conferred resistance to both Bt Δ3942 and Bv WT ( Figure 6 B). Recombinant protein BT_3942 and BVU_0767 demonstrated different substrate specificity for hydrolysis of short chain lengths of Acyl-CoAs and propionyl- and butyryl-CoA but not medium or long chain Acyl-CoAs, with BT_3942 demonstrating substrate preference for butyryl-CoA ( Figures 6 C and S5 C). Together, these results demonstrate that within Bacteroides , differences in the gene function of an Acyl-CoA thioesterase can mediate the variable fitness effects of butyrate.
As opposed to poor conservation of the Acyl-CoA thioesterase between Bt and Bv , the Acyl-CoA transferase BVU_1163 was highly conserved among the Bacteroides ( Figure S5 D), showing 83% AA identity with BT_3193 ( Figures 6 D and S5 E). BT_3193 rendered both Bv Δ1163 and Bt sensitive to butyrate, comparable to that of BVU_1163 ( Figure 6 E). This suggests that the difference in butyrate sensitivity of Bt and Bv may be due to differential regulation of BT_3193 versus BVU_1163. Remarkably, BT_3193 was downregulated in Bt , while BVU_1163 was upregulated in Bv ( Figure 6 F) with corresponding differences in protein levels between these two species ( Figure S5 F). At the strain level, similar to the species level, there was greater expression of BVU_1163 in Bv ATCC (sensitive to butyrate in Glc) compared to Bv CL09 (resistant to butyrate in Glc) ( Figure S5 G). Thus, we observe an association between gene expression of this conserved Acyl-CoA metabolic gene and species- and strain- level variation in the fitness effect of butyrate.
To determine if differential expression of the Acyl-CoA transferase genes in Bt versus Bv is due to intrinsic properties of a specific promoter among Bacteroides , we cloned the promoter regions of BT_3193 (p Bt ) and BVU_1163 (p Bv ) upstream of either the BT_3193 or BVU_1163 operon, respectively, generating a panel of species-specific promoter-gene hybrid constructs ( Figures 6 G). The Bv promoter drove significantly greater expression of either gene compared to the Bt promoter, suggesting that differential gene regulation is due to species-specific intrinsic promoter strength ( Figure 6 G, left). To determine if high or low gene expression driven by the Bv or Bt specific promoters was sufficient to confer sensitivity to butyrate, the engineered strains harboring plasmids expressing each of the six hybrid pairs (no promoter, p Bv , or p Bt with BT_3193 or BVU_1163) were grown with or without butyrate. Remarkably, the strong, high-expression Bv promoter, but not the weak, low-expression Bt promoter ( Figure 6 G, middle), was sufficient to confer butyrate sensitivity to Bv Δ1163 ( Figure 6 G, right) and across a panel of naturally resistant Bacteroides species ( Figure S5 F) and strains ( Figure S5 I). Controlled inducible expression of BVU_1163 induced dose-dependent sensitivity in Bv as a function of sugar strength and Bv Δ1163 and Bv Δ1163 Δ0574 background ( Figure S5 J). Together, these data demonstrate that species-specific expression of a conserved Acyl-CoA transferase gene is regulated by species-specific promoter region to confer Bacteroides differential sensitivity to butyrate.
Species-level variation in butyrate sensitivity was encoded within 200 base pairs of the strain-specific promoter region of the Acyl-CoA transferase BVU_1163/BT_3193 ( Figure 6 G). Transcription initiation occurs by binding of the bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex to specific sequences of the promoter. Comparison of the Bacteroides −7 and −33 regions ( Bayley et al., 2000 4. Bayley, D.P. ∙ Rocha, E.R. ∙ Smith, C.J.

We observed a double nucleotide polymorphism (TTAG for p Bt and TTTA for p Bv ) and a four-nucleotide difference in location of the −33 region between the Bt and Bv Acyl-CoA transferase promoters ( Figure 6 H). To determine the role of these species-specific promoter sequence variations in regulation of Acyl-CoA transferase gene expression, we made a series of constructs in −33 region nucleotide and location polymorphisms on the Bv high expression endogenous promoter backbone and the Bt low expression endogenous promoter backbone ( Figure 6 I, left). Remarkably, replacement of the Bv −33 region with the Bt −33 region nucleotide polymorphism (TTTA to TTAG) at its own or the Bt −33 region location (four-nucleotide spacer deletion) converted the Bv promoter into a low-expression promoter ( Figure 6 I, middle) and conferred resistance to butyrate ( Figure 6 I, right). Conversely, replacement of the Bt −33 region with the Bv −33 region nucleotide polymorphism (TTAG to TTTA) at its own or the Bv −33 region location (4 nucleotide spacer addition) converted the Bt promoter into a high-expression promoter ( Figure 6 I, middle) and conferred sensitivity to butyrate ( Figure 6 I, right). Together these results demonstrate that species-specific nucleotide and location polymorphisms encoded in cis at the −33 promoter region of a conserved Acyl-CoA transferase gene mediate variation in sensitivity of the Bacteroides to butyrate.
Lower expression of BVU_1163 in Bv CL09, compared to Bv ATCC, correlated with strain-level differences in sensitivity to butyrate ( Figure S5 G). However, the promoter sequences of BVU_1163 are 100% identical within species between Bv ATCC and Bv CL09 ( Figure S5 K), suggesting that while −33 promoter cis -acting factors are responsible for regulation of Acyl-CoA transferase, cis -independent factors may be responsible for differential mRNA levels of Acyl-CoA transferase at the strain level. To identify candidate strain-specific regulators of Acyl-CoA transferase expression, we performed RNA-seq in Bv CL09 after pulse of butyrate in Glc ( Table S2 ) and compared global transcriptional responses to butyrate between Bv CL09 and Bv ATCC. We identified 87 genes demonstrating strain-specific regulation in response to butyrate ( Table S2 ; Figure S5 L). Of these, 74 were induced by butyrate specifically in Bv CL09, including 7 transcriptional regulators, two of which were anti-sigma factors AGXZ_01245 and AGXZ_00606 ( Table S2 ) serving as candidates of trans -acting factors mediating cis -independent regulation of Acyl-CoA transferase gene expression at the strain level.
Our in vitro approach revealed that Bacteroides fitness is conditional on both butyrate and the expression level of the Acyl-CoA transferase, BT_3193/BVU_1163, whereby butyrate is inhibitory if the Bacteroides member expresses high levels of BT_3193/BVU_1163 ( Figure 7 A). We next sought evidence of whether Bacteroides fitness in the human gut is a function of butyrate and expression level of this conserved Acyl-CoA transferase. This required a multi-omics in vivo dataset simultaneously capturing metagenomes (MGX; BT_3193/BVU_1163 DNA abundance as a proxy for Bacteroides fitness), metatranscriptomes (MTX; relative expression of BT_3193/BVU_1163 RNA), and metabolomes (MBX; concentration of SCFAs, including butyrate), all from the same human fecal sample. Using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi’omics Database ( Lloyd-Price et al., 2019 41. Lloyd-Price, J. ∙ Arze, C. ∙ Ananthakrishnan, A.N. ..., IBDMDB Investigators Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases Nature. 2019; 569 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (1556) PubMed Google Scholar ), we selected 88 longitudinal samples from 26 healthy subjects with matched MGX, MTX, and MBX data. We tested for associations between Bacteroides abundance and expression level of BT_3193/BVU_1163 under different gut metabolite levels. This analysis, independent of choice of metabolomics normalization method, revealed a significant negative correlation between Bacteroides abundance and the relative expression of BT_3193/BVU_1163 in high butyrate, and no correlation in either low butyrate or high succinate ( Figures 7 B and S6 A) or between butyrate and BCAA ( Figure S7 B). Together, these data suggest that Bacteroides fitness in vivo is a function of both butyrate and expression of a conserved Acyl-CoA transferase in the human gut.

Section: Discussion

For the Bacteroides , the predominant Gram-negative bacteria of the human intestine, survival in the gut is dependent on the ability of each strain to utilize dietary and host sugars. We have revealed a context-dependent inhibitory function of the specific metabolite butyrate where one microbe-derived small molecule acts as a fitness switch depending on the specific sugar utilized and in which individual strains have distinct switches across sugars ( Figure 7 C, left). Our work demonstrates strain-level fitness of members of the gut microbiome as an emergent property ( West-Eberhard, 2019 73. West-Eberhard, M.J. Modularity as a universal emergent property of biological traits J. Exp. Zoolog. B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2019; 332 :356-364 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the interaction of components across molecular class unpredictable by the effect of each part alone. Furthermore, our findings uncover that each strain of the Bacteroides has a unique norm of reaction ( Woltereck, 1909 75. Woltereck, R. Weitere experimentelle Unter-suchungen uber Artveranderung, speziell uber das Wesen quantitativer Artunterschiede bei Daphniden Verh Tsch Zool Ges. 1909; 110-172 Google Scholar ) for each sugar it can utilize. The mechanism of these non-linear reaction norms is within Bacteroides genetic variation in Coenzyme A metabolism which integrates these environmental chemical factors into dynamic fitness phenotypes. Elucidation of the emergent properties of the fitness of members of the gut is instrumental to our understanding of the context-dependent rules that govern the structure of the gut microbiome, its hierarchical organization, and attempts to engineer this ecosystem in health and disease.
Our study reveals a role of the specific SCFA butyrate in gut microbiota ecology. SCFAs play important roles in mammalian health. In microbe-microbe interactions in the gut, these primary metabolites have long been appreciated to be important in positive fitness interactions in microbial ecosystems based on syntrophy, in which bacteria utilize these substrates as energy sources via assimilation or as electron acceptors ( Fischbach and Sonnenburg, 2011 16. Fischbach, M.A. ∙ Sonnenburg, J.L. Eating for two: how metabolism establishes interspecies interactions in the gut Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 10 :336-347 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent work has shown that SCFAs can inhibit Enterobacteriaciae, such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Salmonella enterica , through acidification of the intracellular compartment ( Jacobson et al., 2018 25. Jacobson, A. ∙ Lam, L. ∙ Rajendram, M. ... A Gut Commensal-Produced Metabolite Mediates Colonization Resistance to Salmonella Infection Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :296-307.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sorbara et al., 2019 69. Sorbara, M.T. ∙ Dubin, K. ∙ Littmann, E.R. ... Inhibiting antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae by microbiota-mediated intracellular acidification J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :84-98 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of the SCFAs, butyrate is distinctive in a numbers of ways: (1) it is uniquely made by specific bacteria, notably the Lachnospiraceae (as opposed to other SCFAs that may be made by a wide range of microbes and also the host) ( Lavelle and Sokol, 2020 36. Lavelle, A. ∙ Sokol, H. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites as key actors in inflammatory bowel disease Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2020; 17 :223-237 Crossref Scopus (1009) PubMed Google Scholar ), (2) with rare exceptions ( Ziels et al., 2019 79. Ziels, R.M. ∙ Nobu, M.K. ∙ Sousa, D.Z. Elucidating Syntrophic Butyrate-Degrading Populations in Anaerobic Digesters Using Stable-Isotope-Informed Genome-Resolved Metagenomics mSystems. 2019; 4 e00159–18 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is not used as an energy source by bacteria, and (3) it plays unique roles in host biology and fitness from roles in gut epithelial homeostasis and immunoregulation as an energy source, signaling molecule, and epigenetic modifier ( Koh et al., 2016 30. Koh, A. ∙ De Vadder, F. ∙ Kovatcheva-Datchary, P. ... From Dietary Fiber to Host Physiology: Short-Chain Fatty Acids as Key Bacterial Metabolites Cell. 2016; 165 :1332-1345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4025) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the emergent properties of distinct sugars and butyrate reflects eco-evolutionary interactions playing out between butyrate-producing organisms and individual Bacteroides strains across glycan niches balanced over evolutionary time by host fitness.
We found that butyrate, but not other SCFAs, caused rapid cellular stress, membrane damage, and cell death, conditional on which sugar is being utilized and varying among the Bacteroides . Species- and sugar-dependent inhibitory function of butyrate is due to variation within the Bacteroides in both the function and regulation of Acyl-Coenzyme A metabolism. By identifying a specific inhibitory function of butyrate and elucidating a species-specific and sugar-dependent Coenzyme A-based metabolic defense system, our work presents a connection between growth inhibition and metabolism distinct from known links with growth rate, nutrient limitation, the stringent response, and oxidative stress ( Stokes et al., 2019 70. Stokes, J.M. ∙ Lopatkin, A.J. ∙ Lobritz, M.A. ... Bacterial Metabolism and Antibiotic Efficacy Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :251-259 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). It will be of interest to determine whether these Acyl-CoA metabolic enzymes evolved primarily in defense to butyrate or as a secondary function and whether the role of these enzymes is a general feature of bacteria across environments or specific to the metabolic versatility of Bacteroides and the gut ecosystem.
Our work suggests that several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms may mediate species- and sugar-level variation in the Bacteroides butyrate fitness switch. We discovered that the mechanism governing resistance to butyrate was variation in short Acyl-CoA thioesterase and transferase activity among the Bacteroides . 13 C tracing experiments and metabolite analysis suggest the conversion and accumulation of butyryl-CoA as a mechanism mediating the toxic effects of butyrate on the Bacteroides ( Figure 7 C, right) as an antimetabolite and/or metabolic poison. We found that specific BCAAs tuned the strain- and sugar-dependent toxicity of butyrate. This may occur through modulating specific Acyl-CoA and/or free acyl intracellular metabolites, such as acetyl-CoA, by Ile and Leu or propionyl-CoA by Val via BCAA catabolism by the BCKDH enzyme complex. Alternatively, our demonstration of a mechanistic role of a putative medium/long chain Acyl-CoA synthetase suggests that the protective (Ile, Leu) and detrimental (Val) role of specific BCAAs may be due to their role as precursors in the synthesis of functionally distinct and strain- and sugar-variable odd- (Ile, Leu) or even- (Val) length outer-membrane branched lipids ( Kaiser and Heinrichs, 2018 27. Kaiser, J.C. ∙ Heinrichs, D.E. Branching Out: Alterations in Bacterial Physiology and Virulence Due to Branched-Chain Amino Acid Deprivation MBio. 2018; 9 e01188–18 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found phenotypic discordance between monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric sugars, suggesting that sensing of specific sugars, such as through two components systems ( Schwalm et al., 2017 61. Schwalm, 3rd, N.D. ∙ Townsend, 2nd, G.E. ∙ Groisman, E.A. Prioritization of polysaccharide utilization and control of regulator activation in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 104 :32-45 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), may play a regulatory role in modulating the effects of butyrate in the Bacteroides .
We found that variation in the enzymatic function of an Acyl-CoA thioesterase and regulation of an Acyl-CoA transferase by nucleotide polymorphisms in the RNA polymerase binding site at the −33 promoter region mediated differential resistance to butyrate among the Bacteroides . Strain-level variation in accessory genomes ( Greenblum et al., 2015 19. Greenblum, S. ∙ Carr, R. ∙ Borenstein, E.

Zeevi, D. ∙ Korem, T. ∙ Godneva, A. ... Structural variation in the gut microbiome associates with host health Nature. 2019; 568 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ) is well appreciated in adaptive functions in microbe-microbe, environmental, and host interactions both among the Bacteroides and in the gut microbiota at large, such as by encoding type-VI secretion systems, biosynthetic gene clusters, and polysaccharide utilization. By demonstrating a role for variation in Acyl-CoA metabolic genes, our work suggests that in addition to the accessory genome, the core genome may be under selection in members of the gut microbiota with strain-specific trade-offs between the role of central metabolism in bacterial physiology and ecological roles in diet- and microbe-microbe metabolic defense. Altogether, our work demonstrates a proof-of-principle of the power of “bottom-up” approaches to reveal the forces determining the fitness of each member of the microbiome as a function of the interaction of parts unpredictable by studying each part alone nor reducible from the sum.
There are certain limitations of our work that will be the focus of future research. The first focus will be to understand the significance of glycan-specific impacts on the strain-level fitness of butyrate on the Bacteroides within a complex community ecological context such in competition for glycans with butyrate producing bacteria in vivo . Secondly, while we find a negative correlation between Bacteroides fitness, Acyl-CoA gene expression, and butyrate levels in vivo , we do not know the glycan components of the diet or mucosa for each person and how the presence of specific glycans impacts butyrate-associated fitness effects in human cohorts. Relatedly, while we present accumulation of butyryl-CoA as a candidate factor mediating the inhibitory effects of butyrate on the Bacteroides , whether and how butyryl-CoA is directly toxic and the molecular mechanisms of butyrate inhibitory functions by sugar and across strains remain to be determined.

Bacterial strains used in this study were listed in Key Resource Table. Bacteroidales strains were grown on brain-heart-infusion supplemented with hemin (50 mg/L) and vitamin K 1 (0.25 mg/L) (BHIS) agar plates, in basal medium (BS; proteose peptone (20 g/L), yeast extract (5 g/L), NaCl (5 g/L), glucose (5 g/L), potassium phosphate dibasic (5 g/L), cysteine (0.5 g/L), hemin (50 mg/L) and vitamin K 1 (0.25 mg/L)) ( Pantosti et al., 1991 50. Pantosti, A. ∙ Tzianabos, A.O. ∙ Onderdonk, A.B. ... Immunochemical characterization of two surface polysaccharides of Bacteroides fragilis Infect. Immun. 1991; 59 :2075-2082 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), or in minimal media (MM; ammonium sulfate (1 g/L), sodium carbonate (1 g/L), potassium phosphate monobasic (0.9 g/L), sodium chloride (0.9 g/L), calcium chloride dihydrate (26.5 mg/L), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (2 mg/L), manganese(II) chloride tetrahydrate (1 mg/L), cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (1 mg/L), hemin (50 mg/L), vitamin K 1 (0.25 mg/L), ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (4 mg/L), vitamin B 12 (5 mg/L)) with 0.25% glucose, or the indicated sugar as carbon source ( Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2014 55. Rakoff-Nahoum, S. ∙ Coyne, M.J. ∙ Comstock, L.E. An ecological network of polysaccharide utilization among human intestinal symbionts Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :40-49 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cultures were grown at 37°C in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory) with 80% nitrogen, 10% CO 2 , and 10% hydrogen. Escherichia coli was grown in Luria-Burtani (LB) medium, or on LB agar plate. As necessary, antibiotics were added as the following concentrations: ampicillin 100 μg/mL, kanamycin 50 μg/mL, and gentamycin 200 μg/mL for E. coli , and erythromycin 5 μg/mL for Bacteroides strains. For the inducible promoter, anhydrotetracycline (aTc) was dissolved in 100% ethanol at 2 mg/mL and used at the indicated concentrations (0-25 ng/mL). Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to culture medium at the final 1 mM, or 0.4 mM concentration.
Six week old female germ-free C57BL/6 mice were used for gnotobiotic mouse experiments. Brigham and Women’s Hospital Massachusetts Host-Microbiome Center approved under protocol 2020N000054. Mice were housed in Class Biological Isolator in a temperature-controlled (∼21°C) facility on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Mice were fed a standard chow (Laboratory Rodent Diet 5025, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise indicated.
For growth assays on solid agar plates, three to five colonies from bacteria grown on BHIS plates were suspended in 100 μL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and adjusted to OD 600 ∼0.1 using a Microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek, Synergy HTX multi-mode reader). Three μl of bacterial suspension was dotted on the MM agar containing 0.25% sugar and grown at 37°C anaerobically for the indicated days. Sugars used to supplement MM as carbon source include monosaccharides (glucose (Glc), fructose (Fru), mannose (Man), N -Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose (Gal), arabinose (Ara), xylose (Xyl), fucose (Fuc), Rhamnose (Rha), ribose (Rib), and N -Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)), disaccharides (maltose (Mal), cellobiose (Cel), sucrose (Suc), and palatinose (Pal)), oligosaccharides (3-sialyllactose (3-SL), lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), 2-fucosyllactose (2-FL)), and polysaccharides (pullulan, levan, xylan, xyloglucan, arabinan, arabinogalactan, chondroitin sulfate, inulin, pectin, mannan, and glucomannan). All final concentration of sugars was 0.25%, except levan (0.125%). The sodium form of short chain acids formate, acetate, D- and L-lactate, propionate, malonate, succinate, and butyrate were used at 50 mM concentration. In other experiments the concentration of butyrate was titrated 50 mM down to 0.5 mM. For complex media experiments, a modified version of YCFA ( Browne et al., 2016 6. Browne, H.P. ∙ Forster, S.C. ∙ Anonye, B.O. ... Culturing of ‘unculturable’ human microbiota reveals novel taxa and extensive sporulation Nature. 2016; 533 :543-546 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used: Casitone (5 g/L), yeast extract (1.25 g/L), NaHCO 3 (4 g/L), cysteine (1 g/L), K 2 HPO 4 (0.45 g/L), KH 2 PO 4 (0.45 g/L), NaCl (0.9 g/L), MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O (0.09 g/L), CaCl 2 (0.09 g/L), hemin (10 mg/L), vitamin K 1 (0.25 mg/L), ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (4 mg/L), Vitamin Supplement (10 mL/L; ATCC) and Trace Mineral Supplement (ATCC: 10 mL/L). For growth experiments with branched chain amino acids, 1 mM of isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), valine (Val), or the mixture of Ile and Val were added to 0.25% Glc or Gal MM agar. Stock solutions of 100 mM were pH neutralized to ∼7.0 with NaOH. The recombinant strains harboring plasmids expressing Acyl-CoA metabolic genes were grown in 0.25% Glc MM agar with erythromycin (5 μg/mL). For all figures except kinetics in Figure 2 , day 2 images are shown. Images of bacterial growth were taken using Gel doc system (Bio-Rad) each day.
For growth in liquid MM, bacteria were cultured overnight in BS, diluted 1:10 in fresh BS, grown to mid-log (OD 600 ∼0.5), then inoculated into 0.25% sugar MM with 1:50 ratio. MM was pre-reduced in the anaerobic chamber overnight. For growth kinetics, 200 μl of bacterial culture were grown in 96-well flat bottom plates using a microplate spectrophotometer, and OD 600 was measured at every 30 min for 36 h. To calculate growth rate (k), absorbance readings corresponding to exponential phase (OD 600 : 0.2-0.6) were fit to a log exponential growth equation (Prism 9). For growth of the recombinant strains harboring plasmids expressing Acyl-CoA transferase genes, bacteria were cultured in BS with erythromycin (5 μg/mL) overnight and inoculated to 0.25% Glc MM containing the same antibiotic with 1: 50 ratio.
Quantification of bacterial strains in community cultivation (referred to as “Culture-Seq”) was performed on community cultivation with strains as indicated. Each strain was lifted from BHIS plates, adjusted to OD 600 ∼0.2 in sterile PBS, mixed equally, after which 3 μl of the bacterial suspension was dotted on 0.25% sugar MM agar with and without 50 mM butyrate and grown for 2 days. Co-culture samples were prepared in biological and technical duplicates.
To lyse bacteria, the dotted patches were cut from the co-culture plates, suspended in 300 μl of PBS by vertexing (3 min), followed by alkalization in 20 mM KOH at 90°C for 10 min and 70°C for 20 min, and neutralization in 20 mM HCl, 90 mM Tris-HCl and 30 mM KCl. The conserved rpsC gene was amplified with the cell lysates as template and the barcoded rpsC primers (Table S1) under PCR cycles (98°C 10 s, 60°C 10 s, 72°C 1 min with 25 cycles) using Platinum SuperFi PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For Illumina sequencing, the PCR fragments were amplified with index primers I5/I7 (Table S1) under PCR cycles (98°C 10 s, 55°C 10 s, 72°C 30 s with 10 cycles), followed by purification using Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator Kits (Zymo Research). Libraries were pooled, normalized by qPCR using NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs), and subjected to Illumina NextSeq 500 platform generating 150-nt single-end reads (Illumina Inc). Primers are listed in Table S1.
Six week old female germ-free C57BL/6 mice were reared in gnotobiotic isolators. Four days prior to colonization, diets were switched from standard chow to custom glycan-free chow (Bioserv S10004) and drinking water containing either 1% inulin (Beneo) (filter sterilized) or 1% citrus pectin (Sigma) (autoclaved). Animals (n = 5/group) were then gavaged with a 4-member Bacteroides community of B. nordii CL02T12C05 ( Bn CL02), B. ovatus ATCC 8483 ( Bo ATCC), B. salyersiae DSM 18765 ( Bs DSM), and B. caccae ATCC 43185 ( Bc ATCC), each at 1x10 9 CFU in sterile PBS. Four days post colonization, mice were transitioned to the same dietary glycan drinking water (inulin or pectin) supplemented with 150 mM Na butyrate ( Smith et al., 2013 66. Smith, P.M. ∙ Howitt, M.R. ∙ Panikov, N. ... The microbial metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, regulate colonic Treg cell homeostasis Science. 2013; 341 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (3857) PubMed Google Scholar ). Feces was collected daily before and after butyrate supplementation. To determine the impact of butyrate on the relative abundance in vivo of each Bacteroides member, genomic DNA was extracted from feces using ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research), and amplicon sequencing of the rpsC gene was performed as described above. Significant differences were determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test.
B. thetaiotaomicron VPI 5482 (Bt VPI,) B. vulgatus ATCC 8482 ( Bv ATCC), and B. vulgatus CL09 ( Bv CL09) were cultured overnight in BS and sub-cultured in 2 mL of MM plus the indicated sugar as described above. At early-log phase (OD 600 ∼0.25), bacteria were pulsed with acetate, succinate, butyrate (at final concentration of 50 mM), or water control for 1 h, and harvested (13,000 g, 3 min) for total RNA extraction. Following treatment with 200 μL of TRI reagent (Zymo Research) for 5 min at 50°C, bacteria were frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80°C until use. RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with on-column DNase I treatment and quantified by the NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using a modified version of the RNAtag-seq protocol ( Shishkin et al., 2015 63. Shishkin, A.A. ∙ Giannoukos, G. ∙ Kucukural, A. ... Simultaneous generation of many RNA-seq libraries in a single reaction Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :323-325 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ) by Microbial ‘Omics Core at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Briefly, 0.5 μg of total RNA was fragmented, depleted of genomic DNA, dephosphorylated, and barcoded. rRNA was depleted by using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Epicenter). After depletion of rRNA, pools of barcoded RNAs were converted to Illumina cDNA libraries ( Zhu et al., 2001 78. Zhu, Y.Y. ∙ Machleder, E.M. ∙ Chenchik, A. ... Reverse transcriptase template switching: a SMART approach for full-length cDNA library construction Biotechniques. 2001; 30 :892-897 Crossref Scopus (611) PubMed Google Scholar ). cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq2500 platform to generate approximately 5 million paired-end reads per sample by Genomics Platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
Bt VPI and Bv ATCC cultured in BS were grown in 0.25% Glc MM as described above, then at early log-phase (OD 600 ∼0.2) were pulsed with 50 mM SCFAs and water as control, and incubated for 1 h. The pH indicator BCECF-AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was loaded to the cultures to final 1 μM concentration for 20 min to activate in the cytoplasm. One ml of culture was pelleted (13,000 x g, 3 min), washed and resuspended in 1ml of PBS, and then fluorescence intensity of cells was measured at two excitations, 485 nm and 440 nm with fixed emission at 530 nm using a fluorimeter (Tecan). Intracellular pH was determined by the ratio (485 nm/440 nm) of emission intensities. To generate the standard curve of BCECF-AM, each bacterium grown under the Glc conditions was harvested, washed, and incubated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer ranging pH 4.5 to pH 9.0 with each 10 μM ionophore nigericin and valinomycin at room temperature for 5 min (Bio-protocol). The standard curve, plotted with pH and the emission ratio, was fitted with nonlinear regression (Sigmoidal, 4PL) using Prism 9 (GraphPad). Each experiment was performed 3 replicates per condition. Significant differences were determined by paired two-tailed t test.
For PI staining experiments, Bt VPI and Bv ATCC were grown in 0.25% Glc or Gal MM as described above, then at early log-phase were pulsed with SCFAs and water as control and incubated for 1 h. Bacteria were pelleted (13,000 x g, 3 min), washed, and then incubated in PBS with 10 μg/mL PI (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 15 min. Following washing with PBS two times, cells were fixed in 1ml of 2% paraformaldehyde (Affymetrix) for flow cytometry.
Flow cytometric measurement was performed on a MoFlo XDP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Miami, FL, USA) equipped with a 488 nm (excitation wavelength of PI) argon laser. 50,000 cells were acquired for the analysis. Three parameters were recorded: forward scatter (FSC), related to cell size, side scatter (SSC), related to cell structure, and red fluorescence (PI), related to cell membrane integrity. FSC, SSC, and fluorescence were collected in a logarithmic scale. For gating strategy, each bacterium was grown to mid exponential phase under in Glc to prepare live cells. To prepare killed bacteria, live cells were heated at 55°C for 5 min. In addition to gating on negative controls without PI staining, the mixture of live and the heat-treated bacteria was used to create PI negative, low and high PI bacterial populations. The results of biological triplicate were shown as percentages of PI-positive subpopulation over total events. Significant differences were determined by paired two-tailed t test.
To measure the effect of butyrate on cell viability, Bv ATCC and Bt VPI were grown in 0.25% sugar MM as described for PI staining experiments. At early log-phase (OD600: ∼0.25), bacteria were pulsed with 20 (Figure S3F) or 50 ( Figure 3 D) mM butyrate or water as control. Bacteria were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, and 5 h, diluted with PBS, and plated on BHIS agars to determine colony forming unit (CFU)/mL. Each experiment was performed with 3 replicates per condition. Significant differences were determined by paired two-tailed t test.
For 13 C butyrate tracing experiments, Bt VPI, Bv ATCC and their isogenic strains were grown in 0.25% Glc as described above. At early log-phase (OD600: ∼0.25) cultures were pulsed with 10 mM 13 C4 butyrate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) or water as control and incubated for 30 min. To determine abundance of Acyl-CoAs at steady state, bacteria were pulsed with 20 mM butyrate or water and incubated for 30 min. Five ml cultures of bacteria were harvested (4,000 rpm, 10 min) at 4°C, washed with PBS two times, and pellets stored at −80°C until further use.
For LC/MS analysis, the bacterial pellet was dissolved into 300 μL of 80% MeOH and treated with Sonifier® Cell Disruptor for 1 min. The homogenized solution was centrifuged at 4,350 rpm for 10 min, and the upper clear supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter vial. Q Exactive mass spectrometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a UHPLC system (Ultimate 3000) equipped with a 150 mm C18 column (Kinetex® 2.6 μm C18 100 Å LC Column 150 × 3 mm) was used to analyze the samples. The LC/MS method used for detecting Acyl-CoAs was adopted from previous literature ( Liu et al., 2015 40. Liu, X. ∙ Sadhukhan, S. ∙ Sun, S. ... High-Resolution Metabolomics with Acyl-CoA Profiling Reveals Widespread Remodeling in Response to Diet Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14 :1489-1500 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following LC program was used: Buffer A: water with 5 mM ammonium acetate; Buffer B: methanol. 0 min: 2% B, 1.5 min: 2% B, 3 min: 15% B, 5.5 min: 95% B, 14.5 min: 95% B, 15 min: 2% B, 20 min: 2% B. Flow speed was 0.5 mL/min. Injection volume was 2 μl. Column temperature was set at 25°C. Mass spec acquisition windows were set to 0-10 min at full MS positive mode. The following parameters were used for data collection: Resolution: 70,000, AGC target: 3e6, Maximum IT: 250 ms, scan range: 700 to 1100 m/z. The data analysis was completed using Thermo Freestyle (Version 1.6) and Qual Browser software (Version 4.3). In the run using various Acyl-CoA standards, all the Acyl-CoAs were detected as [M+H] + formula. Therefore, we searched Acyl-CoA peaks in samples using [M+H] + formula for each Acyl-CoA at 5 decimal and 5 ppm resolution. The peak area quantification was done using Genesis method at Freestyle software. The peak area for each sample was then normalized by cell density at OD 600 .
To measure total transcript levels of CoA transferase gene, Bt VPI and Bv ATCC cultivated BS were subcultured in 0.25% sugar MM as described above, collected at early-log (OD 600 ∼0.2), mid-log (OD 600 ∼0.4), and late-log phases (OD 600 ∼0.6). For RNA extraction of the recombinant strains harboring plasmids expressing CoA transferase genes, bacteria were grown in 0.25% sugar MM with erythromycin late exponential phase ( Figures 6 G and 6I). After pelleting (13,000 x g, 3 min), bacteria were treatment with Trizol for 5 min, then, total RNA was extracted according to Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research) protocol.
cDNA of 200 ng RNA was synthesized using SuperScript VI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification of transcripts was performed by real-time PCR (QuantStudio 3) using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). mRNA levels of target genes were normalized to 200-fold dilution of 16S rRNA rrs gene abundance. The relative amount of each PCR product was calculated from standard curves obtained from PCRs with the same primers and serially diluted genomic DNA as templates. The BVU_1163, BT_3193, and rrs genes were detected using primer pairs 114/115, 126/127, and 110/111, respectively. The list of primers used for qRT-PCR is presented in Table S1.
The transposon plasmid pSAM_BcellWH2 ( Wu et al., 2015 76. Wu, M. ∙ McNulty, N.P. ∙ Rodionov, D.A. ... Genetic determinants of in vivo fitness and diet responsiveness in multiple human gut Bacteroides Science. 2015; 350 :aac5992 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ) was modified by adding back the rrnB terminator sequences to the downstream region of ermG within the transposon to reduce the potential polar effect derived by the strong promoter of the ermG gene, named as pWH2-Term6. For conjugation, Bacteroides strains were grown in 20 mL of BS media to early-lag phase culture (OD 600 < 0.1). The E. coli S17-1 λ pir ( Simon et al., 1983 64. Simon, R. ∙ Priefer, U. ∙ Pühler, A. A Broad Host Range Mobilization System for In Vivo Genetic Engineering: Transposon Mutagenesis in Gram Negative Bacteria Nature Biotechnology. 1983; 1 :784-791 Crossref Scopus (5846) Google Scholar ) donor harboring pWH2-Term6 was grown in 1 mL of LB media to log phase. Harvested bacteria were mixed, spotted on BHIS agar plate, and incubated at 37°C less than 18 h aerobically. After pooling the conjugation reaction, Tn mutants were selected on BHIS agar supplemented with gentamicin (200 μg/mL) and erythromycin (5 μg/mL) anaerobically at 37°C for 48 h. Approximately, 100,000 colonies were pooled in LB supplemented with 25% glycerol, and stored at −80°C.
An aliquot of the transposon mutant bank was thawed, recovered overnight in BS (starting OD 600 ∼0.1), back diluted 1:10 to fresh BS, and grown to mid-log phase (OD 600 ∼0.5) in duplicate. This culture (an aliquot was saved as input control) was then diluted 50-fold in 2 mL of MM containing 0.25% defined sugar with and without 50 mM butyrate and grown to mid-log phase at 37°C under anaerobic conditions.
To construct Tn-seq libraries for sequencing, the collected samples were first subjected to DNA extraction using Invitrogen PureLink Genomic DNA mini kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An aliquot of 5 μg of DNA was sheared in 100 μL water to 300∼500 bp using a M220 focused ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc). The sheared DNA was subjected to end repair, A-tailing, and ligated with prepared adapters (generated by annealing two oligos: 5¢-TACCACGACCA-NH2-3¢ and 5¢-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGGTCGTGGTAT-3¢) using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs). Next, transposon junction fragments containing the insertion sites were enriched by two PCR steps using Platinum SuperFi PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In the first PCR, the fragments were amplified (98°C 10 s, 60°C 10 s, 72°C 30 s with 25 cycles) with universal primers matching the transposon and adaptor sequence (Table S1). In the second PCR, the PCR products were amplified (98°C 10 s, 60°C 10 s, 72°C 30 s with 18 cycles) with Truseq-compatible indexed primers containing specific annealing sequences (Table S1). The PCR fragments corresponding to 200∼600 bp were selected using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc). These libraries were normalized using NEBNext Library Quant kit (New England Biolabs) and subjected to NextSeq500 High Output sequencing (Illumina Inc).
To delete target loci by allelic replacement, first, we modified the suicide vector pKNOCK- bla - erm Gb ( Koropatkin et al., 2008 33. Koropatkin, N.M. ∙ Martens, E.C. ∙ Gordon, J.I. ... Starch catabolism by a prominent human gut symbiont is directed by the recognition of amylose helices Structure. 2008; 16 :1105-1115 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a counter-selection system mediated by a variant phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheS A303G ), lethal in the presence of 4-chloro-phenylalanine ( Kino et al., 2016 29. Kino, Y. ∙ Nakayama-Imaohji, H. ∙ Fujita, M. ... Counterselection employing mutated pheS for markerless genetic deletion in Bacteroides species Anaerobe. 2016; 42 :81-88 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the pheS gene, along with its native promoter, was PCR amplified with genomic DNA of Bacteroides fragilis as template and two primer sets (Table S1) generating the mutated pheS gene ( phe S ∗ ). The PCR fragments were cloned into the MfeI site of pKNOCK- bla - erm Gb using GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly Enzyme Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), resulting in a counterselection plasmid pKNOCK- bla-erm Gb_ phe S ∗ .
For deletion of BT_3942 in Bt VPI, BVU_1163, BVU_0574, or BVU_2719 in Bv ATCC, and the homolog genes of BVU_1163, or BVU_2719 in Bv CL09, approximately, 1 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the deletion locus were PCR-amplified, cloned into pKNOCK- bla-erm Gb_ phe S ∗ digested BamHI with ClaI using GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly Enzyme Kit, and transformed into E. coli DH5a λ pir ( Pal et al., 2005 48. Pal, D. ∙ Venkova-Canova, T. ∙ Srivastava, P. ... Multipartite regulation of rctB , the replication initiator gene of Vibrio cholerae chromosome II J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187 :7167-7175 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). The plasmid DNA was transferred into Bacteroides strains by triparental mating using E. coli carrying the helper plasmid RK231 at 37°C aerobically, and merodiploid Bacteroides cells were selected on BHIS plates with gentamicin (200 μg/mL) and erythromycin (5 μg/mL) anaerobically at 37°C. Resistant colonies were restreaked on BHIS plates with erythromycin and grown anaerobically at 37°C for 2 days. For counterselection, the isolated strains were streaked on 0.25% glucose MM containing 4-chloro-phenylalanine (2 mg/mL) and incubated anaerobically for 3-4 days. The deletion of target genes was confirmed with primers corresponding to upstream and downstream flanking regions. Deletion strains and primers for the deletion constructs were listed in Key Resources Table and Table S1.
For inducible promoter-derived expression of the BVU_1163 gene, Bv ATCC isogenic strains were constructed as follows: open reading frame of BVU_1163 was amplified with primers 259/147 and genomic DNA of Bv ATCC as template and cloned into the Bacteroides species integrative plasmid pNBU2- erm _TetR-p1T_DP-GH023 containing the engineered inducible promoter( Lim et al., 2017 39. Lim, B. ∙ Zimmermann, M. ∙ Barry, N.A. ... Engineered Regulatory Systems Modulate Gene Expression of Human Commensals in the Gut Cell. 2017; 169 :547-558.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) digested with NcoI and ClaI. Then, Bv Δ1163 and Bv Δ1163Δ0574 strains were conjugated by E. coli carrying the integration plasmid and selected on BHIS plates with gentamicin (200 μg/mL) and erythromycin (5 μg/mL).
Plasmid pBT_3942 and pBVU_0767 were constructed as follows: Open reading frames (ORF), including ∼50 bp of upstream of the gene to capture native ribosomal binding site (RBS) of BT_3942 and BVU_0767, were amplified with primers 190/191 and genomic DNA of Bt VPI as template, and primers 192/193 and genomic DNA of Bv ATCC as template, respectively, using Platinum SuperFi PCR Master Mix. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and KpnI and cloned into the Bacteroides expression plasmid pFD340 harboring constitutive promoter digested with the same restriction sites ( Smith et al., 1992 65. Smith, C.J. ∙ Rogers, M.B. ∙ McKee, M.L. Heterologous gene expression in Bacteroides fragilis Plasmid. 1992; 27 :141-154 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The CoA transferase genes BVU_1163 and BT_3193 appeared to form an operon with the upstream genes BVU_1164 and BT_3193a, respectively (Figure S5C). Consistent with this, putative RNA polymerase binding sites were found upstream regions of the BVU_1164 and BT_3193a genes ( Figure 6 H). For promoter swapping of the CoA transferase genes, 220 bp and 200 bp upstream of the start codons of the BVU_1164 and BT_3193a genes were used for the promoter regions p Bv and p Bt , respectively. The ORF regions of the BVU_1163 and BT_3193 genes were designed to include their own native RBS (∼50 bp upstream of the gene).
For plasmids p Bv _1163 and p Bt _1163, the promoter regions p Bv and p Bt were generated with primers 208/71 and genomic DNA of Bv ATCC as template, and primers 132/136 and genomic DNA of Bt VPI as template, respectively. ORFs of BVU_1163 were generated with primer sets 70/72 for the p Bv promoter, and 135/72 for the p Bt promoter and genomic DNA of Bv ATCC, respectively. The two fragments corresponding to the promoter and ORF regions were assembled into promoterless-pFD340, of which IS 4351 promoter was removed by digestion with SphI and KpnI, using GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly Enzyme Kit.
For plasmids p Bv _3193 and p Bt _3193, the promoter regions p Bv and p Bt were generated with primers 208/75 and genomic DNA of Bv ATCC, and primers 132/131 and genomic DNA of Bt VPI, respectively, and ORFs of BT_3193 were generated with primer sets 74/77 for the p Bv promoter, and 130/77 for the p Bt promoter and Bt VPI genomic DNA, respectively. The two fragments corresponding to the promoter and ORF regions were assembled into promoterless-pFD340 as described above.
For control vectors, pN_1163 and pN_3193, ORFs of BVU_1163 and BT_3193 were generated with primers 142/57 and genomic DNA of Bv ATCC, and primers 143/77 and genomic DNA of Bt VPI, respectively, and cloned into promoterless pFD340 digested with SphI and KpnI.
To examine expression level of CoA transferase proteins, plasmids p Bv _1163-HA and p Bt _3193-HA were constructed as follows: Plasmid p Bv _1163 and p Bt _3193 as template was amplified with primers 208/477 and 132/478, respectively, then the PCR fragments inserting HA tag were cloned into promoterless pFD340 digested with SphI and KpnI.
Derivatives of plasmid p Bv _1163 with nucleotide substitutions in −33 region (TTTA) of the BVU_1163 promoter were constructed with plasmid p Bv _1163 as template and the following primer pairs: primers 208/214 and 213/72 for p Bv _TTAG-1163 (promoter polymorphism); primers 208/212 and 211/72 for p Bv _TTAG_down-1163 (polymorphism location: deletion of TAGA in the downstream region of TTTA). The PCR fragments were assembled with promoterless pFD340 digested with restriction enzymes SphI and KpnI using GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly Enzyme Kit.
Derivatives of plasmid p Bt _1163 with nucleotide substitutions in −33 region (TTAG) of the BT_3193 promoter were constructed with plasmid p Bt _1163 as template and the following primer pairs: primers 132/216 and 215/72 for p Bt _TTTA-1163 (promoter polymorphism); primers 132/324 and 323/72 for p Bt _TTTA_up-1163 (polymorphism location: insertion of TTTA in the upstream region of TTAG, and replacement of TTAG with AATC). The PCR fragments were assembled with promoterless pFD340 digested with restriction enzymes SphI and KpnI using GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly Enzyme Kit.
Sequence analysis confirmed that the plasmids had the expected nucleotide sequences. The list of primers used in this study is presented in Table S1.
Acyl-CoA thioesterase BT_3942 and BVU_0767 genes, and Acyl-CoA transferase BVU_1163 gene were amplified with primers (Table S1) and genomic DNA of Bt VPI and Bv ATCC 8482 as template, respectively, and cloned into the pET-28a (Novagen) digested with NcoI and AvaI using GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly Enzyme Kit. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) strains, grown to OD 600 ∼0.5 in LB plus kanamycin at 37°C and induced by 1 mM of IPTG at 15°C for 4 h (BT_3942), or by 0.4 mM of IPTG at 15°C overnight (BVU_0767, BVU_1163). After harvesting (6000 g, 10 min, 4°C), cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM Imidazole) with protease inhibitor (Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and lysed by sonication. The cell extracts were spun down, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, mixed with 2 mL of pre-washed Ni-NTA resin (HisPur Ni-NTA Resin, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and incubated on a rotator at 4°C for 1 h. The resin was loaded onto a column and washed with lysis buffer containing 25 mM Imidazole. The recombinant proteins were eluted using lysis buffer containing 250 mM Imidazole for BT_3942, or 300 mM Imidazole for BVU_0767 and BVU_1163. After concentration in a spin concentrator pre-dialysis, fractions of each protein were dialyzed overnight at 4°C in 1 L of storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) in three times. The size and purity of the recombinant proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE gel (NuPAGE 4 to 12%, Bis-Tris Mini Protein Gel, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the concentration of each protein was measured by absorbance at 280 nm using Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of the recombinant proteins was determined spectrophotometrically at 412 nm with 5,5¢-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) as previously reported with minor modification ( Jawed et al., 2016 26. Jawed, K. ∙ Mattam, A.J. ∙ Fatma, Z. ... Engineered Production of Short Chain Fatty Acid in Escherichia coli Using Fatty Acid Synthesis Pathway PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0160035 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). All reactions were carried out 200 μl of 60 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 μM DTNB, 5 μM bovine serum albumin, and 100 μM of different chain length of acyl-CoAs (acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA) in 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 μl of the recombinant enzyme at final concentration 25 nM into the mixture at 37°C. The liberation of free CoA was monitored at 412 nm for 25 min using a microplate spectrophotometer. Enzymatic assays were performed with duplicates per condition. Significant differences were determined by unpaired two-tailed t test.
Acyl-CoA transferase activity of the recombinant protein was measured by determining the concentrations of acetyl-CoA with citrate synthase assay as previously reported with minor modifications ( Sato et al., 2016 58. Sato, M. ∙ Yoshida, Y. ∙ Nagano, K. ... Three CoA Transferases Involved in the Production of Short Chain Fatty Acids in Porphyromonas gingivalis Front. Microbiol. 2016; 07 Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar ). Briefly, the reaction mixture (40 μl) consisted of 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 100 mM sodium acetate, and 0.5 mM of different chain lengths of acyl-CoAs (propionyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and hexanoyl-CoA). The purified enzyme was added to the reaction mixture at final concentration 1.5 μM and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4.5% trichloroacetic acid and neutralized by adding 25 μL of 400 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). To determine acetyl-CoA, assay mixture (25 μl) containing 4 mM oxaloacetate, 4 mM DTNB, and 36.8 μg/mL citrate synthase was added to the reaction mixture, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The free CoA of the reaction mixture was measured at 412 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer. Enzymatic assays were performed with duplicates per condition.
To examine expression of Acyl-CoA transferase in protein level, Bt and Bv strains harboring plasmids p Bt _3193-HA and p Bv _1163-HA were grown in 0.25% Glc as described above, and harvested (12,000 rpm x 5 min) at early and late log phase. Bacteria were suspended in PBS with protease inhibitor and lysed by sonication. Cell extracts (30 μg-150 μg protein) were loaded on 4 to 12% NuPAGE gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 3% skim milk solution at room temperature for 30 min. Primary antibody, mouse anti-HA (Santa Cruz) and mouse anti- E. coli RpoA (Biolegend), which cross-reacts with Bacteroides RpoA ( Hecht et al., 2017 21. Hecht, A.L. ∙ Casterline, B.W. ∙ Choi, V.M. ... A Two-Component System Regulates Bacteroides fragilis Toxin to Maintain Intestinal Homeostasis and Prevent Lethal Disease Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 22 :443-448.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), were used at 1:4000 dilution in PBST (PBS/0.05% Tween 20) with 1% skim milk. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antisera (Santa Cruz) was used at 1:5,000 dilution. Blots were developed with SuperSignalWest Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The phylogenic tree of Bacteroidales strains was generated ( Figure 2 A), based on the core genes (526 for Bacteroides and 1114 for Parabacteroides) which have 80% identity in amino acid sequence levels, using the concatenated alignment for a neighbor-joining tree in MEGA ( https://www.megasoftware.net/ ).
53 Bacteroidales strains were grown on MM agar plates under 11 monosaccharides conditions in the presence and absence of butyrate for 4 days. To calculate butyrate susceptibility across strains and sugars ( Figure 2 A), the images of bacterial growth over time were analyzed using a custom built MATLAB (MatWorks) script. First, the location of the focal colony was automatically detected (with manual checking and adjustment if necessary) using the CircularHough_Grd function, and the average pixel density across the colony was used as a quantitative growth measurement, normalized by the maximum pixel density in control conditions. For ease of interpretation, we then discretely binned these normalized values so that growth on a given day can vary between 0 (no growth) or 5 (pixel density equal to or above maximum value in control conditions). This process yielded two 1 × 4 vectors of discrete values that describe the growth over time of the focal strain, in the focal sugar, either with or without butyrate. Inhibition level on each day was calculated by subtracting the butyrate growth vector from the control vector (note, we set any negative values to zero, these correspond to instances where the focal strain grew more with butyrate than without). The inhibition score was defined as the sum of this inhibition vector across strains and sugars, creating a matrix that describes the level of inhibition across all conditions.
Illumina raw reads were first demultiplexed using skewer v0.2.2 ( Lim et al., 2017 39. Lim, B. ∙ Zimmermann, M. ∙ Barry, N.A. ... Engineered Regulatory Systems Modulate Gene Expression of Human Commensals in the Gut Cell. 2017; 169 :547-558.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) allowing no mismatch with both primers, next quality trimmed using vsearch v2.7.1 ( Rognes et al., 2016 56. Rognes, T. ∙ Flouri, T. ∙ Nichols, B. ... VSEARCH: a versatile open source tool for metagenomics PeerJ. 2016; 4 :e2584 Crossref Scopus (6121) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the setting “–fastq_filter–fastq_truncee 1,” and further trimmed to the uniform length 110 nt. The trimmed reads were dereplicated and finally used to map against a custom database of Bacteroides rpsC sequences using vsearch with the “–usearch_global” setting. Chimeras were removed using usearch v10.0.240 ( Edgar, 2010 13. Edgar, R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2460-2461 Crossref Scopus (15878) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Sequencing reads from each sample in a pool were demultiplexed based on their associated barcode sequence using custom scripts. Reads were aligned to the B. thetaiotaomicron VPI 5482, B. vulgatus ATCC 8482, and B. vulgatus CL09 reference genomes using BWA ( Li and Durbin, 2009 38. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32766) PubMed Google Scholar ) and read counts were assigned to genes and other genomic features using custom scripts. Differential expression analysis was conducted with DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 42. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48468) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Pairwise comparisons were performed with log2-transformed normalized RNA-seq reads between SCFAs and water control in different sugars with biological duplicates per condition. To identify genes expression that correlated with the strength of butyrate fitness effects, expression of statistically significant genes (|log2(fold change)| > 1, padj < 0.05) with 1.5 fold difference across sugars were grouped as follows: 1) Glc < GlcNAc < Gal or Xyl, 2) Glc > GlcNAc > Gal or Xyl, 3) Glc > GlcNAc = Gal = Xyl, or 4) Glc < GlcNAc = Gal = Xyl, and no gradient across 4 sugars (Glc = GlcNAc = Gal = Xyl). RNA-Seq data were listed in Table S2.
Functional annotation term and/or clustering of butyrate-responding genes was analyzed by using DAVID 6.8 (NIAID/NIH), and statistically significant functional groups were highlighted in color (p val < 0.001).
To analyze the fitness of transposon mutants in the library, Illumina raw reads were subjected to the following bioinformatics pipeline. The demultiplexed reads were first trimmed using cutadapt v1.17 ( Martin, 2011 45. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. Journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) to remove transposon and adaptor sequences (“-g GACTTATCATCCAACCTGT -O 17 -e 0.2” and “-a ATACCACGAC -O 5 -e 0.1 -m 15”). These trimmed reads were then mapped to the corresponding Bacteroides reference genome using Bowtie v1.2.2 ( Langmead et al., 2009 35. Langmead, B. ∙ Trapnell, C. ∙ Pop, M. ... Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome Genome Biol. 2009; 10 :R25 Crossref Scopus (16508) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the setting “-n 3 -l 28 -e 120–best.” The derived insertion tallies were subjected to comparative analysis between each pair of control and butyrate samples using Transit v2.1.0 ( DeJesus et al., 2015 10. DeJesus, M.A. ∙ Ambadipudi, C. ∙ Baker, R. ... TRANSIT--A Software Tool for Himar1 TnSeq Analysis PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004401 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) under the “resampling” mode with the setting “-n TTR -iN 0.05 -iC 0.05.” As each experiment was performed in biological duplicates, to combine fold change (butyrate /control) and p -values from two replicates, we used the smaller absolute value fold change and the higher p -value for each gene, which is more conservative than other methods such as Fisher’s method. As the Transit resampling method had a default p -value detection limit of 10e-4, for more significant hits that were marked as p -value = 0, we randomly assigned p -values < 10e-4 for the sake of volcano plots. Statistically significant genes were highlighted in red (|log2(fold change)|> 1, p adj < 0.05) in volcano plots.
Tn-Seq data were listed in Table S3.
Functional profiles for metagenomes (MGX), metatranscriptomes (MTX) and metabolomes (MBX) were downloaded from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi’omics Databases ( https://www.ibdmdb.org/ ) ( Lloyd-Price et al., 2019 41. Lloyd-Price, J. ∙ Arze, C. ∙ Ananthakrishnan, A.N. ..., IBDMDB Investigators Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases Nature. 2019; 569 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (1556) PubMed Google Scholar ) on April 2019. These included 1,638 MGX, 818 MTX and 546 MBX samples, respectively, in total comprising 132 subjects (with multiple time points for each). The abundance profiles of gene families (UniRef90s) ( Suzek et al., 2007 71. Suzek, B.E. ∙ Huang, H. ∙ McGarvey, P. ... UniRef: comprehensive and non-redundant UniProt reference clusters Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :1282-1288 Crossref Scopus (951) PubMed Google Scholar ) for MGX and MTX were generated by HUMAnN 2.11.0, which we previously optimized to identify and quantify genes from individual microbial species present at > 1x fold-coverage in a community sequencing sample ( Franzosa et al., 2018 18. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Rahnavard, G. ... Species-level functional profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :962-968 Crossref Scopus (952) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene expression profiles were analyzed as the ratios between each gene family’s MTX versus MGX abundance per sample, where undefined values (zero divided by zero) and non-finite values (non-zero divided by zero) were removed (treated as NA). Metabolomic profiles were measured using a combination of four LC-MS method ( Lloyd-Price et al., 2019 41. Lloyd-Price, J. ∙ Arze, C. ∙ Ananthakrishnan, A.N. ..., IBDMDB Investigators Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases Nature. 2019; 569 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (1556) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sum-normalized metabolite data (sum-normalized to 1 per sample per LC-MS method) and median-normalized metabolite counts (which is used to reduce technical sample to sample variation) were taken from the associated publication’s supporting information ( Lloyd-Price et al., 2019 41. Lloyd-Price, J. ∙ Arze, C. ∙ Ananthakrishnan, A.N. ..., IBDMDB Investigators Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases Nature. 2019; 569 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (1556) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both types of metabolite data were analyzed, with roughly equivalent results (Figure S6A). MGX, MTX and MBX samples were strictly matched for multi-omic association if they derived from the same subject and sampling time point (yielding 88 samples from 26 nonIBD participants: 52 samples from 14 adult participants and 36 samples from 12 child participants). Since multiple samples from the same subject were often present, we considered only the last matched MGX:MTX:MBX samples from each subject for the following correlation analysis (yielding 26 samples from 26 individuals) (Table S5). For Figure 7 B, the relative abundance range for low butyrate level (minimum to median value) is 3.56 × 10 −5 to 2.15 × 10 −3 ; for high-butyrate (median to maximum value) is 2.15 × 10-3 to 9.67 × 10 −3 .
To explore putative associations between microbial features and metabolites in Bacteroides CoA metabolism pathway genes, we identified CoA transferase (BVU_1163) homologs in Bacteroides using a UniRef-based protein sequence catalog ( Suzek et al., 2015 72. Suzek, B.E. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Huang, H. ..., UniProt Consortium UniRef clusters: a comprehensive and scalable alternative for improving sequence similarity searches Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :926-932 Crossref Scopus (968) PubMed Google Scholar ) (UniRef release 2014_07). We first: i) identified the gene family UniRef90_R7P442 (UniRef90 cluster: > 90% amino acid identity and > 80% coverage) of BVU_1163, then ii) linked this to its corresponding UniRef50 cluster UniRef50_P52043 (requiring > 50% identity and > 80% coverage), iii) summed the gene abundances of all UniRef90s in this UniRef50 cluster per sample, and finally iv) further summed the abundances of all such UniRef50 clusters (members of UniRef50_P52043) from Bacteroides species per sample. Two butyrate levels (low-butyrate and high-butyrate) were defined as being above or below the median metabolomic abundance of butyrate (across all included samples, Table S5). Within each of these two butyrate levels, we calculated the Spearman correlation between the gene abundance and gene expression contributed by BVU_1163 Bacteroides UniRef50 families. The same approach was then applied to succinate metabolite abundances as well.
Amino acid sequence alignment of Acyl-CoA thioesterase BT_3942 from Bt VPI as reference and Acyl-CoA transferase BVU_1163 from Bv ATCC as reference was performed using NCBI BLAST service against 42 Bacteroides strains (Figure S5).
Images of bacterial growth are one representative of at least biological duplicates or triplicates. Graphpad Prism version 9 was used for all statistical analyses. For pairwise and two independent group comparison Student’s t test was used, while for multiple group comparison Two-way ANOVA were performed. Statistical significance is indicated as follows: ns > 0.05, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. For correlation analysis of MGX:MTX:MBX samples, correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed using a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) approach with a conservative FDR q -value < 0.05 required as a threshold for statistical significance.
