Title: Structural Basis for Potent Neutralization of Betacoronaviruses by Single-Domain Camelid Antibodies


Abstract: Summary

Coronaviruses make use of a large envelope protein called spike (S) to engage host cell receptors and catalyze membrane fusion. Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutics. Here, we describe the isolation of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spikes. These VHHs neutralize MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses, respectively. Crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs interfere with receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion. These data provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.

Section: Introduction

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that are divided into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ) and infect a wide variety of host organisms ( Woo et al., 2009 60. Woo, P.C. ∙ Lau, S.K. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Coronavirus diversity, phylogeny and interspecies jumping Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2009; 234 :1117-1127 Crossref Scopus (517) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are at least seven coronaviruses that can cause disease in humans, and four of these viruses (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E) circulate seasonally throughout the global population, causing mild respiratory disease in most patients ( Gaunt et al., 2010 15.

Microbiol. 2010; 48 :2940-2947 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ). The three remaining viruses, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are zoonotic pathogens that have caused epidemics or pandemics with severe and often fatal symptoms after emerging into the human population ( Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2020; Zaki et al., 2012 6.

Med. 2012; 367 :1814-1820 Crossref Scopus (4218) PubMed Google Scholar ). For these highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses, prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are needed.
The surfaces of coronaviruses are decorated with a spike (S) glycoprotein, a large class I fusion protein ( Bosch et al., 2003 5. Bosch, B.J. ∙ van der Zee, R. ∙ de Haan, C.A. ... The coronavirus spike protein is a class I virus fusion protein: structural and functional characterization of the fusion core complex J. Virol. 2003; 77 :8801-8811 Crossref Scopus (1099) PubMed Google Scholar ). The S protein forms a trimeric complex that can be functionally categorized into two distinct subunits, S1 and S2, that are separated by a protease cleavage site. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which interacts with a host-cell receptor protein to trigger membrane fusion. The S2 subunit contains the membrane fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and the α-helical heptad repeats. The functional host cell receptors for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively ( Li et al., 2003; Raj et al., 2013 32.

The interactions between these receptors and their respective RBDs have been thoroughly characterized, both structurally and biophysically ( Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2013 33.

Recently, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 S also makes use of ACE2 as a functional host-cell receptor, and several structures of this complex have already been reported ( Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020 21.

Recent advances in cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) have allowed researchers to determine high-resolution structures of the trimeric S protein ectodomains and understand how S functions as a macromolecular machine ( Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Li et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013 25.

Structure of MERS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain complexed with human receptor DPP4 Cell Res. 2013; 23 :986-993 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initial cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-1 spike revealed that the RBDs adopted at least two distinct conformations. In the “up” conformation, the RBDs jut out away from the rest of S, such that they can easily engage ACE2 without steric clash. In the “down” conformation, the RBDs are tightly packed against the top of the S2 subunit, preventing binding by ACE2 ( Gui et al., 2017 19. Gui, M. ∙ Song, W. ∙ Zhou, H. ... Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein reveal a prerequisite conformational state for receptor binding Cell Res. 2017; 27 :119-129 Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequent experiments have corroborated this phenomenon and similar dynamics have been observed in MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and in alphacoronavirus S proteins ( Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp and McLellan, 2019; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2017 26.

Commun. 2017; 8 :15092 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of the relatively low abundance of particles that can be observed by cryo-EM with three RBDs in the up conformation, it is thought that this conformation may correspond to an energetically unstable state ( Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017 26. Kirchdoerfer, R.N. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Pallesen, J. ... Stabilized coronavirus spikes are resistant to conformational changes induced by receptor recognition or proteolysis Sci.

Immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike antigen Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7348-E7357 Crossref Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations have led to the hypothesis that the CoV RBDs might act as a molecular ratchet: a receptor-binding event would trap the RBD in the less stable up conformation, leading to gradual destabilization of S1 until S2 is finally triggered to initiate membrane fusion. Recent experiments characterizing RBD-directed anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies that trap the SARS-CoV-1 RBD in the up conformation and lead to destabilization of the prefusion S have lent support to this hypothesis ( Walls et al., 2019 53. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.J. ... Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039.15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Numerous anti-SARS-CoV-1 RBD and anti-MERS-CoV RBD antibodies have been reported, and their mechanisms of neutralization can be attributed to the occlusion of the receptor-binding site and to trapping the RBD in the unstable up conformation, effectively acting as a receptor mimic that triggers a premature transition from the prefusion-to-postfusion conformation ( Hwang et al., 2006; Walls et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015 23.

Virol. 2018; 92 :e02002-e02017 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids also produce heavy-chain-only antibodies (HCAbs), which contain a single variable domain (VHH) instead of two variable domains (VH and VL) that make up the equivalent antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of conventional immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies ( Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993 20. Hamers-Casterman, C. ∙ Atarhouch, T. ∙ Muyldermans, S. ... Naturally occurring antibodies devoid of light chains Nature. 1993; 363 :446-448 Crossref Scopus (2424) PubMed Google Scholar ). This single variable domain, in the absence of an effector domain, is referred to as a single-domain antibody, VHH, or Nanobody and typically can acquire affinities and specificities for antigens comparable to conventional antibodies. VHHs can easily be constructed into multivalent formats and they have higher thermal stability and chemostability than most antibodies ( De Vlieger et al., 2018; Dumoulin et al., 2002; Govaert et al., 2012; Laursen et al., 2018; Rotman et al., 2015; van der Linden et al., 1999 9.

Comparison of physical chemical properties of llama VHH antibody fragments and mouse monoclonal antibodies Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431 :37-46 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ). VHHs are also known to be less susceptible to steric hindrances that might prevent the binding of larger conventional antibodies ( Forsman et al., 2008 14. Forsman, A. ∙ Beirnaert, E. ∙ Aasa-Chapman, M.M. ...

Virol. 2008; 82 :12069-12081 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Their advantageous biophysical properties have led to the evaluation of several VHHs as therapeutics against common respiratory pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ( Detalle et al., 2015; Rossey et al., 2017 10. Detalle, L. ∙ Stohr, T. ∙ Palomo, C. ... Generation and Characterization of ALX-0171, a Potent Novel Therapeutic Nanobody for the Treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Antimicrob.

Potent single-domain antibodies that arrest respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein in its prefusion state Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14158 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The use of VHHs as biologics in the context of a respiratory infection is a particularly attractive application, because the highly stable VHHs can be nebulized and administered via an inhaler directly to the site of infection ( Respaud et al., 2015 45. Respaud, R. ∙ Vecellio, L. ∙ Diot, P. ... Nebulization as a delivery method for mAbs in respiratory diseases Expert Opin. Drug Deliv. 2015; 12 :1027-1039 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, because of their stability after prolonged storage, VHHs could be stockpiled as therapeutic treatment options in case of an epidemic. Although therapeutics against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are sorely needed, the feasibility of using VHHs for this purpose has not yet been adequately explored. Several MERS-CoV S-directed VHHs have been reported as a result of camelid immunization, but their epitopes remain largely undefined, other than being classified as RBD-directed ( Stalin Raj et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018 49.

Here, we report the isolation of two potently neutralizing VHHs directed against the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV RBDs, respectively. These VHHs were elicited in response to immunization of a llama with prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV S proteins. We solved the crystal structures of these two VHHs in complex with their respective viral epitopes, which suggested likely mechanisms of neutralization were occlusion of the receptor-binding interface and trapping of the RBDs in the up conformation. We also show that the SARS-CoV-1 RBD-directed VHH cross-reacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and can block the receptor-binding interface. After engineering this VHH into a bivalent Fc-fusion, we show that this cross-reactive VHH can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses. We further demonstrate that the VHH-Fc fusion can be produced at high yields in an industry-standard CHO cell system, suggesting that it merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Section: Results

Our initial aim was to isolate VHHs that could potently neutralize MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. Therefore, we sequentially immunized a llama subcutaneously twice with SARS-CoV-1 S protein, twice with MERS-CoV S protein, once again with SARS-CoV-1 S, and finally with both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV S protein ( Figure S1 A). To obtain VHHs directed against these S proteins, two consecutive rounds of panning were performed by phage display using either SARS-CoV-1 S or MERS-CoV S proteins. Positive clones were sequenced, and multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method revealed that seven unique MERS-CoV S and five unique SARS-CoV-1 S VHHs were isolated ( Figure S1 B). These VHHs and an irrelevant control (RSV F-VHH, directed against the F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus) were subsequently expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified from the yeast medium ( Rossey et al., 2017 46. Rossey, I. ∙ Gilman, M.S. ∙ Kabeche, S.C. ... Potent single-domain antibodies that arrest respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein in its prefusion state Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14158 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The binding of the purified VHHs to prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-1 S was confirmed by ELISA ( Figure S1 C). As expected, the irrelevant control had no detectable binding to MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-1 S. Four clones (MERS VHH-55, -12, -34, and -40), obtained after panning on MERS-CoV S protein, bound with high affinity to prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S, whereas the affinities of VHH-2, -20 and -15 were 100- to 1000-fold weaker. Of the five clones isolated after panning on SARS-CoV-1 S protein, three VHH clones (SARS VHH-72, -1, and -6) interacted strongly with prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We observed no cross-reactivity of MERS VHHs with SARS-CoV-1 S and vice versa (data not shown).
To assess the antiviral activity of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S-directed VHHs, we performed in vitro neutralization assays using MERS-CoV England1 S and SARS-CoV-1 Urbani S pseudotyped lentiviruses. The high-affinity MERS VHH-55, -12, -34, and -40 neutralized MERS-CoV S pseudotyped virus with IC 50 values ranging from 0.014 to 2.9 μg/mL (0.9 nM to 193.3 nM), whereas the lower affinity MERS-CoV- or SARS-CoV-1-specific VHHs had no measurable inhibitory effect ( Table S1 ). SARS VHH-6 and -44 neutralized lentiviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-1 S with IC 50 values of 0.14 (9 nM) and 5.5 μg/mL (355 nM), respectively. No binding was observed for SARS VHH-44 to prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-1 S protein in the ELISA assay. Sequence analysis revealed that the neutralizing MERS-CoV-specific VHHs -12, -40, and -55 have highly similar complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), indicating that they likely belong to the same clonal family and may bind to the same epitope ( Figure S2 ). In contrast, the CDRs from the SARS-CoV S-specific VHHs -44 and -72 are very different.
To map the epitopes targeted by the VHHs, we tested binding to recombinant MERS-CoV S1, RBD, and N-terminal domain (NTD) and SARS-CoV-1 RBD and NTD by ELISA ( Figure 1 A; Figure S3 ).The MERS-CoV S-specific VHHs strongly bound to MERS-CoV S1 and RBD in a concentration-dependent manner and failed to bind to the MERS-CoV NTD. Similarly, strong binding of SARS VHH-72 and VHH-6 to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD protein but not the SARS-CoV-1 NTD protein was observed. No binding of SARS VHH-44 to either the SARS-CoV-1 S or NTD protein was detected, leaving the domain that this VHH recognizes undetermined. These data demonstrate that SARS VHH-72, SARS VHH-6, and MERS VHH-55 target the RBDs. We measured the affinities of SARS VHH-72 and MERS VHH-55 by immobilizing recombinantly expressed VHH to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensorchip and determined the binding kinetics for their respective RBDs. We found that both of these VHHs bound to their targets with high affinity. SARS VHH-72 bound to its target with an affinity of 1.2 nM and MERS VHH-55 bound to its target with an affinity of 79.2 pM, in part due to a very slow off-rate constant ( k d = 8.2 x10 −5 s −1 ) ( Figure 1 B).
To investigate the molecular determinants that mediate potent neutralization and high-affinity binding by MERS VHH-55, we solved the crystal structure of MERS VHH-55 bound to the MERS-CoV RBD. Crystals grew in space group C 222 1 and diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 3.4 Å. After determining a molecular replacement solution and iterative building and refinement, our structure reached an R work /R free of 24.7%/27.8% ( Table S2 ). The asymmetric unit of this crystal contained eight copies of the MERS VHH-55 + MERS-CoV RBD complex and had a solvent content of ~58%. The electron density allowed unambiguous definition of the interface between the RBD and VHH, with the three CDRs forming extensive binding contacts with the RBD, burying 716 Å 2 of surface area by pinching the RBD between the CDR2 and CDR3. The CDR3 of MERS VHH-55 is looped over the DPP4-binding interface, occluding DPP4 from productively engaging the MERS-CoV RBD ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
There are numerous contacts between the CDRs of MERS VHH-55 and the MERS-CoV RBD; most are confined to CDRs 2 and 3. A network of interactions from all three CDRs ( Figures 2 C and 2D) suggests that RBD residue Arg542 has a critical role in MERS VHH-55 binding. This arginine has previously been identified as one of the 12 conserved residues that are crucial for high-affinity DPP4 engagement ( Figure S4 A) ( Wang et al., 2013; 2014 56. Wang, N. ∙ Shi, X. ∙ Jiang, L. ... Structure of MERS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain complexed with human receptor DPP4 Cell Res. 2013; 23 :986-993 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar 57.

Bat origins of MERS-CoV supported by bat coronavirus HKU4 usage of human receptor CD26 Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16 :328-337 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to forming a salt bridge with Glu513 from the MERS-CoV RBD, Trp99 of the MERS VHH-55 CDR3 is positioned near a hydrophobic patch formed by Phe506 ( Figure S4 B). This residue exhibits natural sequence variation in several MERS-CoV strains, such that a Leu is occasionally observed at this position. To evaluate the extent to which this substitution impacts MERS VHH-55 binding, we generated a F506L substitution and measured binding by SPR ( Figure S4 C). This substitution resulted in a ~200-fold reduction in MERS VHH-55 binding affinity. Despite this substantial reduction, the affinity of MERS VHH-55 to MERS-CoV RBD F506L remained high, with a K D = 16.5 nM. Other than the variability that is observed at position 506 of the MERS-CoV RBD, the rest of the MERS VHH-55 epitope is highly conserved across the 863 strains that are curated in the MERS-CoV Virus Variation database ( Figure S4 A). Despite this predicted broad recognition of MERS-CoV strains, the average sequence identity of 24% between the MERS-CoV RBD and the RBDs from the seasonal coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 makes it unlikely that MERS VHH-55 would cross-react with any of these more distantly related S proteins.
We also sought to discover the molecular determinants of binding between SARS VHH-72 and the SARS-CoV-1 RBD by determining the crystal structure of this complex. Crystals grew in space group P 3 1 21 and diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 2.2 Å. We obtained a molecular replacement solution and refined the structure to an R work /R free of 20.3%/23.6% through iterative building and refinement ( Table S2 ). Our structure reveals that CDRs 2 and 3 contribute to most of the 834 Å 2 of buried surface area at the binding interface ( Figure 3 A). This epitope does not, however, overlap with the ACE2 footprint on the SARS-CoV-1 RBD. Rather, ACE2 would clash with the CDR-distal framework of SARS VHH-72, as opposed to classical receptor blocking in which the CDRs would occupy the ACE2 binding interface ( Figure 3 B). ACE2 also carries an N -glycan modification at position Asn322 ( Yan et al., 2020 63. Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Structural basis for the recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; 367 :1444-1448 Crossref Scopus (3567) PubMed Google Scholar ). When bound to the RBD, this N -glycan points into the space that is occupied by SARS VHH-72, forming an even larger clash ( Figure 3 C). SARS VHH-72 binds to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD through a hydrogen-bond network involving CDRs 2 and 3, in which backbone groups participate extensively ( Figures 3 D and 3E). This network probably accounts for the high-affinity binding that we observed for these two molecules.
Analysis of 10 available SARS-CoV-1 sequences revealed a high degree of conservation in the residues that make up the SARS VHH-72 epitope, prompting us to explore the breadth of SARS VHH-72 binding ( Figure S5 A). WIV1-CoV is a betacoronavirus found in bats that is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and also utilizes ACE2 as a host-cell receptor ( Ge et al., 2013 16. Ge, X.Y. ∙ Li, J.L. ∙ Yang, X.L. ... Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor Nature. 2013; 503 :535-538 Crossref Scopus (1260) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of the relatively high degree of sequence conservation between SARS-CoV-1 and WIV1-CoV, we expressed the WIV1-CoV RBD and measured binding to SARS VHH-72 by SPR ( Figure S5 B). SARS VHH-72 exhibited high-affinity binding to the WIV1-CoV RBD (7.4 nM), demonstrating that it cross-reacts with these two closely related coronaviruses ( Figure S5 C).
Based on the high degree of structural homology that has been reported between SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S ( Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020 54. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5950) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also tested SARS VHH-72 for cross-reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and subdomain 1 (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1) by SPR ( Figure 4 ). The equilibrium dissociation constant of SARS VHH-72 for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 was ~39 nM, substantially higher than for the SARS-CoV-1 RBD. The weaker binding can primarily be attributed to an increase in the dissociation rate constant ( Figure 4 A). The only variant residue on the SARS-CoV-1 RBD that makes direct contact with SARS VHH-72 is Arg426, which is Asn439 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure 3 C). This mutation prevents the formation of a salt bridge with Asp61 from SARS VHH-72, which likely contributes to the increased dissociation rate constant. Because of an average sequence identity of only 25% between the SARS-CoV-1 RBD and the RBDs of the seasonal coronaviruses, we predict that SARS VHH-72 cross-reactivity is likely confined to the RBD from SARS-CoV-2 and closely related betacoronaviruses such as WIV1-CoV.
The RBDs of MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-1 S, and SARS-CoV-2 S undergo dynamic conformational rearrangements that alternately mask and present their receptor-binding interfaces and potential neutralizing epitopes to host molecules. By aligning the crystal structures of the MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72 complexes to the cryo-EM structures of the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, we can begin to understand how these molecules might function in the context of these dynamic rearrangements. When the MERS-CoV RBDs are all in the down conformation or all in the up conformation, MERS VHH-55 would be able to bind all three of the protomers making up the functional spike trimer without forming any clashes. However, if a down protomer was bound by MERS VHH-55 and the neighboring protomer sampled the up conformation, this RBD would then be trapped in this state by the presence of the neighboring MERS VHH-55 molecule ( Figure 5 A). This conformational trapping would be even more pronounced upon SARS VHH-72 binding to the SARS-CoV-1 S protein or the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Because of the binding angle of SARS VHH-72, when a bound SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD samples the down conformation, it would clash with the S2 fusion subunit, regardless of the conformations of the neighboring RBDs ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Therefore, once a single SARS VHH-72 binding event took place, the bound protomer would be trapped in the up conformation until either SARS VHH-72 was released or until the S protein was triggered to undergo the prefusion-to-postfusion transition. Based on the binding angles of MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72, we can conclude that these molecules would likely disrupt the RBD dynamics in the context of a trimeric S protein by trapping the up conformation. Because this up conformation is unstable and leads to S protein triggering, it is possible that this conformational trapping may at least partially contribute to the neutralization mechanisms of these VHHs.
To investigate the receptor-blocking ability of the VHHs, we performed a biolayer interferometry (BLI)-based assay in which the SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV RBDs were immobilized to biosensor tips, dipped into VHHs, and then dipped into wells containing the recombinant, soluble host cell receptors. We found that when tips coated with the MERS-CoV RBD were dipped into MERS VHH55 before being dipped into DPP4, there was no increase in response that could be attributed to receptor binding. When tips coated with the MERS-CoV RBD were dipped into SARS VHH-72 and then DPP4, a robust response signal was observed, as expected. Similar results were observed when the analogous experiments were performed using the SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, SARS VHH-72, and ACE2 ( Figure 5 D). These results are consistent with conclusions from our structural analysis that these VHHs can neutralize their respective viral targets by directly interfering with host cell receptor binding.
Despite the relatively high affinity determined by SPR of SARS VHH-72 for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we could only weakly detect the interaction by ELISA. Moreover, SARS VHH-72 weakly neutralized SARS-CoV-2 S vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviruses, possibly because of the high dissociation rate constant, although it readily neutralized SARS-CoV-1 VSV pseudotyped reporter viruses ( Figures 6 A–6D). In an attempt to compensate for this rapid dissociation, we engineered two bivalent variants of SARS VHH-72. These included a tail-to-head fusion of two SARS VHH-72 molecules connected by a (GGGGS) 3 linker (VHH-72-VHH-72) and a genetic fusion of SARS VHH-72 to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (VHH-72-Fc) ( Figures S6 A–S6C). These bivalent SARS VHH-72 constructs bound to both prefusion SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 as demonstrated by ELISA and by a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 to the ACE2 receptor on Vero E6 cells ( Figures 6 C–6D; Figures S6 B and S6C). We also detected binding of both of these constructs to full-length SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S expressed on the surface of mammalian cells ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Supernatants of HEK293S cells transiently transfected with VHH-72-Fc exhibited neutralizing activity against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S VSV pseudoviruses in the same assay that showed weak cross-reactive neutralization by monovalent SARS VHH-72 ( Figures 6 E and 6F). A BLI experiment measuring binding of VHH-72-Fc to immobilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 further confirmed that bivalency was able to compensate for the high dissociation constant of the monomer ( Figure 7 A). Furthermore, the cross-neutralizing VHH-72-Fc construct reached expression levels of ~300 mg/L in ExpiCHO cells ( Figure 7 B). Using VHH-72-Fc purified from ExpiCHO cells and a SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped VSV with a luciferase reporter, we evaluated the neutralization capacity of VHH-72-Fc and found that it neutralized pseudovirus with an IC 50 of approximately 0.2 μg/mL ( Figure 7 C).

Section: Discussion

Here, we report the isolation and characterization of two potently neutralizing single-domain antibodies from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 spikes. These VHHs bind to the spike RBDs with high affinity and are capable of neutralizing S pseudotyped viruses in vitro . To our knowledge, the isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHHs have not been described before. Several MERS-CoV S-specific VHHs have been described, all of which have been directed against the RBD. Several of these VHHs have also been reported to block DPP4 binding, much like MERS VHH-55 ( Stalin Raj et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018 49. Stalin Raj, V. ∙ Okba, N.M.A. ∙ Gutierrez-Alvarez, J. ...

By solving the crystal structures of these newly isolated VHHs in complex with their respective viral targets, we provide detailed insights into epitope binding and their mechanisms of neutralization.
A number of RBD-directed conventional antibodies that are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV have been described. The epitope of MERS VHH-55 overlaps with the epitopes of several of these MERS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies including C2, MCA1, m336, JC57-14, D12, 4C2, and MERS-27 ( Chen et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; 2018; Ying et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015 7.

Structural basis for the neutralization of MERS-CoV by a human monoclonal antibody MERS-27 Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :13133 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 A). The epitope of SARS VHH-72 does not significantly overlap with the epitopes of any previously described antibodies other than that of the recently described CR3022, which can also bind to the RBDs of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S ( Hwang et al., 2006; Pak et al., 2009; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2020 23.

However, unlike SARS VHH-72, CR3022 does not prevent the binding of ACE2 and it lacks neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 ( Tian et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020 50. Tian, X. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Huang, A. ... Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody Emerg.

A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Science. 2020; Crossref Scopus (1030) Google Scholar ). This discrepancy in function, despite the partially overlapping epitope, is likely due to the different angles of approach that these two antibodies adopt ( Figure S7 C). Because SARS VHH-72 binds with a nanomolar K D to a portion of the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD that exhibits low sequence variation, as demonstrated by its cross-reactivity with the WIV1-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, it may broadly bind S proteins from other SARS-CoV-like viruses. We show that by engineering a bivalent VHH-72-Fc construct, we can compensate for the relatively high off-rate constant of the monovalent SARS VHH-72. This bivalent molecule expresses well in transiently transfected ExpiCHO cells (~300 mg/L) and can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses in vitro . Future panning efforts using existing libraries and SARS-CoV-2 S may yield even more potent neutralizers.
Because of the inherent thermostability and chemostability of VHHs, they have been investigated as potential therapeutics against several diseases. HIV- and influenza-directed VHHs have been reported previously, and there are multiple RSV-directed VHHs that have been evaluated ( Detalle et al., 2015; Ibañez et al., 2011; Koch et al., 2017; Rossey et al., 2017 10.

Potent single-domain antibodies that arrest respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein in its prefusion state Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14158 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The possibility of administering these molecules via a nebulized spray is particularly attractive in the case of respiratory pathogens because the VHHs could theoretically be inhaled directly to the site of infection in an effort to maximize bioavailability and function ( Larios Mora et al., 2018 30. Larios Mora, A. ∙ Detalle, L. ∙ Gallup, J.M. ... Delivery of ALX-0171 by inhalation greatly reduces respiratory syncytial virus disease in newborn lambs MAbs. 2018; 10 :778-795 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of the current lack of treatments for MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 and the devastating effects associated with pandemic coronavirus outbreaks, both prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are sorely needed. It is our hope that because of their favorable biophysical properties and their potent neutralization capacity, MERS VHH-55, SARS VHH-72, and VHH-72-Fc may serve as both useful reagents for researchers and as potential therapeutic candidates.

FreeStyle293F cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) and HEK293-S cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) were cultured in FreeStyle293 expression media (Life Technologies), cultured at 37°C with 8% CO 2 while shaking at 130 rpm. HEK293-T cells (ATCC) and Vero E6 cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine, non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Huh7.5 cells (provided by Dr. Deborah R. Taylor) were cultured at 37°C with 8% CO 2 in flasks with DMEM + 10% FBS. ExpiCHO-S cells (GIBCO) were cultured at 37°C with 8% CO 2 while shaking at 130 rpm in ExpiCHO expression media (GIBCO). Cells lines were not tested for mycoplasma contamination nor authenticated.
Llama immunizations and subsequent VHH library generation were performed by VIB Nanobody Core as follows. A llama, negative for antibodies against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 S glycoprotein, was subcutaneously immunized with approximately 150 μg recombinant SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein on days 0, 7, 28 and 150 μg recombinant MERS-CoV S-2P protein on days 14 and 21 and 150 μg of both MERS-CoV S-2P and SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein on day 35 ( Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017 26. Kirchdoerfer, R.N. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Pallesen, J. ... Stabilized coronavirus spikes are resistant to conformational changes induced by receptor recognition or proteolysis Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :15701 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Pallesen, J. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike antigen Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7348-E7357 Crossref Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ). The adjuvant used was Gerbu LQ#3000. Immunizations and handling of the llama were performed according to directive 2010/63/EU of the European parliament for the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (permit No. 13-601-1). Blood was collected 5 days after the last immunization for the preparation of lymphocytes. Total RNA from the peripheral blood lymphocytes was extracted and used as template for the first strand cDNA synthesis with oligo dT primer. Using this cDNA, the VHH encoding sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned between the PstI and NotI sites of the phagemid vector pMECS. In the pMECS vector, the VHH encoding sequence is followed by a linker, HA and His 6 tag (AAAYPYDVPDYGSHHHHHH). Electro-competent E.coli TG1 cells were transformed with the recombinant pMECS vector resulting in a VHH library of about 3 × 10 8 independent transformants. The resulting TG1 library stock was then infected with VCS M13 helper phages to obtain a library of VHH-presenting phages.
Phages displaying MERS-CoV-specific VHHs were enriched after 2 rounds of biopanning on 20 μg of immobilized MERS-CoV S-2P protein in one well of a microtiter plate (type II, F96 Maxisorp, Nuc). For each panning round an uncoated well was used as a negative control. The wells were then washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.05% Tween 20 and blocked with SEA BLOCK blocking buffer (Thermo Scientific) in the first panning round and 5% milk powder in PBS in the second panning round. About 10 11 phages were added to the coated well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Non-specifically bound phages were removed by washing with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (10 times in the first panning round and 15 times in the second panning round). The retained phages were eluted with TEA-solution (14% trimethylamine (Sigma) pH 10) and subsequently neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8. The collected phages were amplified in exponentially growing E.coli TG1 cells, infected with VCS M13 helper phages and subsequently purified using PEG 8,000/NaCl precipitation for the next round of selection. Enrichment after each panning round was determined by infecting TG1 cells with 10-fold serial dilutions of the collected phages after which the bacteria were plated on LB agar plates with 100 μg/mL − ampicillin and 1% glucose.
Phages displaying SARS-CoV-1 directed VHHs were enriched after 2 rounds of biopanning on 20 μg of SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein captured with an anti-foldon antibody (generously provided by Dr. Vicente Mas) in one well of a microtiter plate (type II, F96 Maxisorp, Nuc). Before panning phages were first added to DS-Cav1 protein ( McLellan et al., 2013 38. McLellan, J.S. ∙ Chen, M. ∙ Joyce, M.G. ... Structure-based design of a fusion glycoprotein vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus Science. 2013; 342 :592-598 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ) containing a C-terminal foldon domain, to deplete foldon specific phages. The unbound phages were next added to the coated well. Panning was performed as described above.
After panning, 45 individual colonies of phage infected bacteria isolated after the first panning round on MERS-CoV S-2P or SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein and 45 individual colonies isolated after the second panning round on MERS-CoV S-2P or SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein were randomly selected for further analysis by ELISA for the presence of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 specific VHHs, respectively. The individual colonies were inoculated in 2 mL of terrific broth (TB) medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin in 24-well deep well plates. After growing individual colonies for 5 h at 37°C, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mM) was added to induce VHH expression during overnight incubation at 37°C. To prepare periplasmic extract, the bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in 250 μL TES buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sucrose) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently 350 μL water was added to induce an osmotic shock. After 1 h incubation at 4 °C followed by centrifugation, the periplasmic extract was collected.
VHH-containing periplasmic extracts were then tested for binding to either MERS-CoV S-2P or SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein. Briefly, in the PE-ELISA screen after panning on MERS-CoV S-2P protein, wells of microtiter plates (type II, F96 Maxisorp, Nuc) were coated overnight at 37°C with 100 ng MERS-CoV S-2P (without foldon), MERS-CoV S-2P protein (with foldon) or as negative controls coated with SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein (with foldon), HCoV-HKU1 S-2P (without foldon), DS-Cav1 (with foldon) or bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich). In the PE-ELISA screen after panning on SARS-CoV-1 S protein wells of microtiter plates (type II, F96 Maxisorp, Nuc) were coated with 100 ng SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein (with foldon), SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein captured with an anti-foldon antibody (with foldon) or as negative controls coated with MERS-CoV S-2P (without foldon), HCoV-HKU1 S-2P (without foldon), DS-Cav1 (with foldon) or bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich). The coated plates were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS and 50 μL of the periplasmic extract was added to the wells. Bound VHHs were detected with anti-HA (1/2,000, MMS-101P Biolegend) mAb followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-mouse IgG (1/2,000, NXA931, GE Healthcare). Periplasmic fractions, for which the OD 450 value of the antigen coated wells were at least two times higher than the OD 450 value of the BSA coated wells, were considered to be specific for the coated antigen and selected for sequencing. The selected clones were grown in 3 mL of LB medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The DNA of the selected colonies was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced using the MP057 primer (5′-TTATGCTTCCGGCTCGTATG-3′).
In order to express the MERS- and SARS-CoV VHHs in Pichia pastoris , the VHH encoding sequences were cloned in the pKai61 expression vector (described by Schoonooghe et al., 2009 48. Schoonooghe, S. ∙ Kaigorodov, V. ∙ Zawisza, M. ... Efficient production of human bivalent and trivalent anti-MUC1 Fab-scFv antibodies in Pichia pastoris BMC Biotechnol. 2009; 9 :70 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the vector, the VHH sequences contain a C-terminal 6x His-tag, are under the control of the methanol inducible AOX1 promotor and in frame with a modified version of the S.cerevisae α-mating factor prepro signal sequence. The vector contains a Zeocine resistance marker for selection in bacteria as well as in yeast cells. The VHH encoding sequences were amplified by PCR using the following forward and reverse primer (5′-GGCGGGTATCTCTCGAGAAAAGGCAGGTGCAGCTGCAGGAGTCTGGG-3′) and (5′- CTAACTAGTCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTGGCTGGAGACGGTGACCTGG-3′) and cloned between the Xho I and Spe I sites in the pKai61 vector. The vectors were linearized by PmeI and transformed in the Pichia pastoris strain GS115 by electroporation at 1500 V using a Gene Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad) ( Lin-Cereghino et al., 2005 35. Lin-Cereghino, J. ∙ Wong, W.W. ∙ Xiong, S. ... Condensed protocol for competent cell preparation and transformation of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris Biotechniques. 2005; 38 44, 46, 48 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ) . After transformation, the yeast cells were plated on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose and 2% (w/v) agar) supplemented with zeocin (100 μg/mL) for selection.
To generate bivalent tandem tail-to-head VHH constructs, the VHH sequence was amplified by PCR using the following forward (5′- GGGGTATCTCTCGAGAAAAGGCAGGTGCAGCTGGTGGAGTCTGGG-3′) and reverse (5′- AGACTCCTGCAGCTGCACCTGACTACCGCCGCCTCCAGATCCACCTCCGCCACTACCGCCTCCGCCGCTGGAGACGGTGACCTGGG-3′) primers, thereby removing a PstI site from the beginning of the VHH coding sequence and adding a (GGGGS) 3 linker and the start of the VHH coding sequence with a PstI site at the end of the sequence. After PCR, the fragment was cloned between the XhoI and SpeI sites in a SARS VHH-72 containing pKai61 vector, thereby generating a homo-bivalent construct. The vector containing this bivalent VHH was linearized and transformed in GS155 Pichia pastoris cells as outlined above.
The transformed Pichia pastoris clones were first expressed in 2 mL cultures. On day 1, 4 clones of each construct were inoculated in 2 mL of YPNG medium (2% pepton, 1% Bacto yeast extract, 1.34% YNB, 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 6, 0.00004% biotin, 1% glycerol) with 100 μg/mL Zeocin (Life Technologies) and incubated while shaking at 28 °C for 24 h. The next day, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and the medium was replaced by YPNM medium (2% pepton, 1% Bacto yeast extract, 1.34% YNB, 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 1% methanol) to induce VHH expression. Cultures were incubated at 28°C and 50 μL of 50% methanol was added at 16, 24 and 40 h. After 48 h, the yeast cells were pelleted and the supernatant was collected. The presence of soluble VHHs in the supernatants was verified using SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining. VHH-containing supernatants of the different clones for each construct were pooled and the VHHs were purified using HisPur™ Ni-NTA Spin Plates (88230, Thermo Scientific). Next, purified VHHs were concentrated on AcroPrep™ Advance 96-well filter plates for ultrafiltration 3 kDa cutoff (8033,Pall) and the imidazole-containing elution buffer was exchanged with PBS.
Production was scaled up (50 mL) for the VHHs with neutralizing capacity. Growth and methanol induction conditions and harvesting of medium were similar as mentioned above for the 2 mL cultures. The secreted VHHs in the medium were precipitated by ammonium sulfate (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 precipitation (80% saturation) for 4 h at 4°C. The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 g and resuspended in 10 mL binding buffer (20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.5, 0.5M NaCl and 20 mM imidazole pH 7.4). The VHHs were purified from the solution using a 1 mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). To elute the bound VHHs a linear imidazole gradient starting from 20 mM and ending at 500 mM imidazole in binding buffer over a total volume of 20 mL was used. VHH containing fractions were pooled and concentrated and the elution buffer was exchanged with PBS with a Vivaspin column (5 kDa cutoff, GE Healthcare).
Wells of microtiter plates (type II, F96 Maxisorp, Nuc) were coated overnight at 4°C, respectively, with 100 ng recombinant MERS-CoV S-2P protein (with foldon), SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein (with foldon), MERS-CoV RBD, MERS-CoV NTD, MERS-CoV S1, SARS-CoV-1 RBD, SARS-CoV-1 NTD or Fc-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1. The coated plates were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS. Dilution series of the VHHs were added to the wells. Binding was detected by incubating the plates sequentially with either mouse anti-Histidine Tag antibody (MCA1396, Abd Serotec) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-mouse IgG (1/2000, NXA931, GE Healthcare) or Streptavidin-HRP (554066, BD Biosciences) or by an HRP-linked rabbit anti-camelid VHH monoclonal antibody (A01861-200, GenScript). After washing 50 μL of TMB substrate (Tetramethylbenzidine, BD OptETA) was added to the plates and the reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μL of 1 M H 2 SO4. The absorbance at 450 nM was measured with an iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio Rad). Curve fitting was performed using nonlinear regression (Graphpad 7.0).
Pseudovirus neutralization assay methods have been previously described ( Pallesen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015 42. Pallesen, J. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike antigen Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7348-E7357 Crossref Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Wang, L. ∙ Shi, W. ∙ Joyce, M.G. ... Evaluation of candidate vaccine approaches for MERS-CoV Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7712 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, pseudoviruses expressing spike genes for MERS-CoV England1 (GenBank ID: AFY13307) and SARS-CoV-1 Urbani (GenBank ID: AAP13441.1) were produced by co-transfection of plasmids encoding a luciferase reporter, lentivirus backbone, and spike genes in 293T cells ( Wang et al., 2015 58. Wang, L. ∙ Shi, W. ∙ Joyce, M.G. ... Evaluation of candidate vaccine approaches for MERS-CoV Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7712 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Serial dilutions of VHHs were mixed with pseudoviruses, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then added to previously-plated Huh7.5 cells. 72 h later, cells were lysed, and relative luciferase activity was measured. Percent neutralization was calculated considering uninfected cells as 100% neutralization and cells transduced with only pseudovirus as 0% neutralization. IC 50 titers were determined based on sigmoidal nonlinear regression.
To generate replication-deficient VSV pseudotyped viruses, HEK293T cells, transfected with MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-1 S or SARS-CoV-2 S were inoculated with a replication deficient VSV vector containing eGFP and firefly luciferase expression cassettes. After a 1 h incubation at 37°C, inoculum was removed, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in media supplemented with an anti-VSV G mAb (ATCC) for 16 h. Pseudotyped particles were then harvested and clarified by centrifugation ( Berger Rentsch and Zimmer, 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2020 4. Berger Rentsch, M. ∙ Zimmer, G. A vesicular stomatitis virus replicon-based bioassay for the rapid and sensitive determination of multi-species type I interferon PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e25858 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar 21. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Krüger, N. ... The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor ACE2 and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for entry into target cells bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). For the VSV pseudotype neutralization experiments, the pseudoviruses were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with different dilutions of purified VHHs or with dilution series of culture supernatant of 293S cells that had been transfected with plasmids coding for SARS VHH-72 fused to human IgG1 Fc (VHH-72-Fc) or with GFP-binding protein (GBP: a VHH specific for GFP). The incubated pseudoviruses were subsequently added to confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells. Sixteen h later, the transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring the firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates using the firefly luciferase substrate of the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Glowmax plate luminometer (Promega).
Mammalian expression plasmids encoding SARS VHH72, MERS VHH55, residues 367-589 of MERS-CoV S (England1 strain), residues 320-502 of SARS-CoV-1 S (Tor2 strain), residues 307-510 of WIV1-CoV S, residues 319-591 of SARS-CoV-2 S, residues 1-281 of SARS-CoV-1 S (Tor2 strain), residues 1-351 of MERS-CoV S (England1 strain), residues 1-751 of MERS-CoV S (England1 strain), residues 1-1190 of SARS-CoV-1 S (Tor2 strain) with K968P and V969P substitutions (SARS-CoV-1 S-2P), residues 1-1291 of MERS-CoV S (England1 strain) with V1060P and L1061P substitutions (MERS S-2P), residues 1-1208 of SARS-CoV-2 S with K986P and V987P substitutions (SARS-CoV-2 S-2P), residues 1-615 of ACE2 and residues 40-766 of DPP4 were transfected into FreeStyle293 cells using polyethylenimine (PEI). All of these plasmids contained N-terminal signal sequences to ensure secretion into the cell supernatant. Supernatants were harvested and constructs containing C-terminal HRV3C cleavage sites, 8x His-Tags and Twin-Strep-Tags (SARS VHH72, MERS VHH55, MERS-CoV S1, SARS-CoV-1 S-2P, MERS-CoV S-2P, SARS-CoV-2 S-2P, ACE2 and DPP4) were purified using Strep-Tactin resin (IBA). Constructs containing C-terminal HRV3C cleavage sites and Fc-tags (SARS-CoV-1 RBD, MERS-CoV RBD, WIV1-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1, SARS-CoV-1 NTD, MERS-CoV NTD) were purified using Protein A resin (Pierce). The SARS-CoV-1 RBD, MERS-CoV RBD, WIV1-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1, SARS VHH-72, MERS VHH-55, MERS-CoV NTD and SARS-CoV-1 NTD were then further purified using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN 3 . MERS-CoV S1, SARS-CoV-1 S-2P, MERS-CoV S-2P, ACE2 and DPP4 were further purified using a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN 3 .
HEK293S cells were transfected with VHH-72-Fc or VHH-72-Fc (S) encoding plasmids using PEI. Briefly, suspension-adapted and serum-free HEK293S cells were seeded at 3 × 10 6 cells/mL in Freestyle-293 medium (ThermoFisher Scientific). Next, 4.5 μg of pcDNA3.3-VHH72-Fc plasmid DNA was added to the cells and incubated on a shaking platform at 37°C and 8% CO 2 , for 5 min. Next, 9 μg of PEI was added to the cultures, and cells were further incubated for 5 h, after which an equal culture volume of Ex-Cell-293 (Sigma) was added to the cells. Transfections were incubated for 4 days, after which cells were pelleted (10’, 300 g) and supernatants were filtered before further use.
VHH-72-Fc was expressed in ExpiCHO cells (ThermoFisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, a 25 mL culture of 6 x10 6 cells/mL, grown at 37°C and 8% CO 2 was transfected with 20 μg of pcDNA3.3-VHH-72-Fc plasmid DNA using ExpiFectamine CHO reagent. One day after transfection, 150 μL of ExpiCHO enhancer and 4 mL of ExpiCHO feed was added to the cells, and cultures were further incubated at 32°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells were fed a second time 5 days post-transfection. Cultures were harvested as soon as cell viability dropped below 75%. For purification of the VHH-72-Fc, supernatants were loaded on a 5 mL MabSelect SuRe column (GE Healthcare). Unbound proteins were washed away with McIlvaine buffer pH 7.2, and bound proteins were eluted using McIlvaine buffer pH 3. Immediately after elution, protein-containing fractions were neutralized using a saturated Na 3 PO 4 buffer. These neutralized fractions were then pooled, and loaded onto a HiPrep Desalting column for buffer exchange into storage buffer (25 mM L-Histidine, 125 mM NaCl).
His-tagged SARS VHH-72 or MERS VHH-55 was immobilized to a single flow cell of an NTA sensorchip at a level of ~400 response units (RUs) per cycle using a Biacore X100 (GE Healthcare). The chip was doubly regenerated using 0.35 M EDTA and 0.1 M NaOH followed by 0.5 mM NiCl 2 . Three samples containing only running buffer, composed of 10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.005% Tween 20, were injected over both ligand and reference flow cells, followed by either SARS-CoV-1 RBD, WIV1-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 or MERS-CoV RBD serially diluted from 50-1.56 nM, with a replicate of the 3.1 nM concentration. The resulting data were double-reference subtracted and fit to a 1:1 binding model using the Biacore X100 Evaluation software.
Plasmids encoding for MERS VHH-55 and residues 367-589 of MERS-CoV S with a C-terminal HRV3C cleavage site and a monomeric human Fc tag were co-transfected into kifunensin-treated FreeStyle 293F cells, as described above. After purifying the cell supernatant with Protein A resin, the immobilized complex was treated with HRV3C protease and Endoglycosidase H to remove both tags and glycans. The complex was then purified using a Superdex 75 column in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN 3 . The purified complex was then concentrated to 5.0 mg/mL and used to prepare hanging-drop crystallization trays. Crystals grown in 1.0 M Na/K phosphate pH 7.5 were soaked in mother liquor supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 3.40 Å at the SBC beamline 19-ID (APS, Argonne National Laboratory)
Plasmids encoding for SARS VHH-72 and residues 320-502 of SARS-CoV-1 S with a C-terminal HRV3C cleavage site and a monomeric human Fc tag were co-transfected into kifunensin-treated FreeStyle 293F cells, as described above. After purifying the cell supernatant with Protein A resin, the immobilized complex was treated with HRV3C protease and Endoglycosidase H to remove both tags and glycans. The processed complex was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN 3 . The purified complex was then concentrated to 10.0 mg/mL and used to prepare hanging-drop crystallization trays. Crystals grown in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 0.2 M LiSO 4 , 0.1 M LiCl and 8% PEG 8000 were soaked in mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.20 Å at the SBC beamline 19-ID (APS, Argonne National Laboratory)
Diffraction data for both complexes were indexed and integrated using iMOSFLM before being scaled in AIMLESS ( Battye et al., 2011; Evans and Murshudov, 2013 3.

Crystallogr. 2013; 69 :1204-1214 Crossref Scopus (3199) PubMed Google Scholar ). The SARS-CoV-1 RBD+SARS VHH-72 dataset was phased by molecular replacement in PhaserMR using coordinates from PDBs 2AJF and 5F1O as search ensembles ( McCoy, 2007 37. McCoy, A.J. Solving structures of protein complexes by molecular replacement with Phaser Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63 :32-41 Crossref Scopus (1314) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MERS-CoV RBD+MERS VHH-55 dataset was also phased by molecular replacement in PhaserMR using coordinates from PDBs 4L72 and 5F1O as search ensembles. The resulting molecular replacement solutions were iteratively rebuilt and refined using Coot, ISOLDE and Phenix ( Adams et al., 2002; Croll, 2018; Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 1.

Anti-human capture (AHC) tips (FortéBio) were soaked in running buffer composed of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20 and 1 mg/mL BSA for 20 min before being used to capture either Fc-tagged SARS-CoV-1 RBD, Fc-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 or Fc-tagged MERS-CoV RBD to a level of 0.8 nm in an Octet RED96 (FortéBio). Tips were then dipped into either 100 nM MERS VHH-55 or 100 nM SARS VHH-72. Tips were next dipped into wells containing either 1 μM ACE2 or 100 nM DPP4 supplemented with the nanobody that the tip had already been dipped into to ensure continued saturation. Data were reference-subtracted and aligned to each other in Octet Data Analysis software v11.1 (FortéBio) based on a baseline measurement that was taken before being dipped into the final set of wells that contained either ACE2 or DPP4.
BLI measurements were also performed with VHH-72-Fc fusion produced in HEK293S cells. SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a mouse IgG1 Fc tag (Sino Biological) was immobilized to an anti-mouse IgG Fc capture (AMC) tip (FortéBio) to a response level of 0.5 nm. Supernatant of non-transfected and VHH-72-Fc transfected HEK293-S cells was applied in a three-fold dilution series in kinetics buffer. Binding was measured at 30°C, with baseline and dissociation measured in equal dilution of non-transformed HEK293S supernatant in kinetics buffer. Between analyses, biosensors were regenerated by three times 20 s exposure to regeneration buffer (10 mM glycine pH 1.7).
Binding of VHH-72-Fc, VHH-72-Fc (S) and monomeric and bivalent SARS VHH-72 to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S was analyzed by flow cytometry using cells transfected with a GFP expression plasmid combined with an expression plasmid for either SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-Cov-2 S. HEK293S culture media (1/20 diluted in PBS + 0.5%BSA) of VHH-72-Fc and VHH-72-Fc (S) transformants were incubated with transfected cells. Binding of the VHH-72-Fc and VHH-72-Fc (S) to cells was detected with an AF633 conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody, whereas binding of monomeric and bivalent VHHs to SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 S was detected with a mouse anti-HisTag antibody and an AF647 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody. Binding was calculated as the mean AF633 fluorescence intensity (MFI) of GFP expressing cells (GFP + ) divided by the MFI of GFP negative cells (GFP - ).
SARS-CoV-2 RBD fused to murine IgG Fc (Sino Biological) at a final concentration of 0.4 μg/mL was incubated with a dilution series of tail-to-head bivalent VHHs or VHH-Fc fusions and incubated at room temperature for 20 min before an additional 10 min incubation on ice. Vero E6 cells grown at sub-confluency were detached by cell dissociation buffer (Sigma) and trypsin treatment. After washing once with PBS the cells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS on ice. All remaining steps were also performed on ice. The mixtures containing RBD and tail-to-head bivalent VHHs or VHH-Fc fusions were added to the cells and incubated for one h. Subsequently, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and stained with an AF647 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Following additional 3 washes with PBS containing 0.5% BSA, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using an BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Binding and neutralization assays were conducted with at least duplicate measurements and presented as the mean ± SEM of the indicated number of replicates. Details can be found in figure legends.
