Title: Polyamine metabolism is a central determinant of helper T cell lineage fidelity


Abstract: Summary

Polyamine synthesis represents one of the most profound metabolic changes during T cell activation, but the biological implications of this are scarcely known. Here, we show that polyamine metabolism is a fundamental process governing the ability of CD4 + helper T cells (T H ) to polarize into different functional fates. Deficiency in ornithine decarboxylase, a crucial enzyme for polyamine synthesis, results in a severe failure of CD4 + T cells to adopt correct subset specification, underscored by ectopic expression of multiple cytokines and lineage-defining transcription factors across T H cell subsets. Polyamines control T H differentiation by providing substrates for deoxyhypusine synthase, which synthesizes the amino acid hypusine, and mice in which T cells are deficient for hypusine develop severe intestinal inflammatory disease. Polyamine-hypusine deficiency caused widespread epigenetic remodeling driven by alterations in histone acetylation and a re-wired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Thus, polyamine metabolism is critical for maintaining the epigenome to focus T H cell subset fidelity.

Section: Introduction

Upon activation, T cells proliferate to form effector cells that mediate immunity. For CD4 + helper T (T H ) cells, this clonal expansion is linked to their differentiation into distinct subsets with specialized functions, which are critical for controlling pathogens and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Three major subsets of effector CD4 + T H cells are T H 1, T H 2, and T H 17 cells. These cells differentiate from naive T cells in response to signals from antigen presenting cells during activation and local microenvironmental cues. The functional specialization of T H cells is conferred by the expression of T cell subset-specific transcription factors (TFs) that coordinate genetic programs to direct production of signature cytokines and surface molecules mediating interactions with other cells ( Murphy and Stockinger, 2010 42. Murphy, K.M. ∙ Stockinger, B. Effector T cell plasticity: flexibility in the face of changing circumstances Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11 :674-680 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a simplified overview, T H 1 cells express the TF T-bet and the cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ and mediate responses to intracellular pathogens. T H 2 cells express GATA3 and interleukin (IL)-4 and control helminth infections. T H 17 cells synthesize RORγt and IL-17 and limit extracellular bacteria and fungi, particularly at mucosal surfaces ( Kanno et al., 2012 32. Kanno, Y. ∙ Vahedi, G. ∙ Hirahara, K. ... Transcriptional and epigenetic control of T helper cell specification: molecular mechanisms underlying commitment and plasticity Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :707-731 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). A fourth subset of T H cell, regulatory T cells (T regs ), modulates immunity by dampening effector T cell activation and proliferation and expresses the TF Foxp3 ( Fontenot et al., 2003 19. Fontenot, J.D. ∙ Gavin, M.A. ∙ Rudensky, A.Y. Foxp3 programs the development and function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4 :330-336 Crossref Scopus (6435) PubMed Google Scholar ). This partitioning of the CD4 + T cell response, such that pathogens drive distinct T H effector programs, necessitates that faithful T H differentiation is essential to mount an optimal immune response to any given threat.
Metabolic reprograming is critical for T cell activation and differentiation ( Buck et al., 2015 7. Buck, M.D. ∙ O’Sullivan, D. ∙ Pearce, E.L. T cell metabolism drives immunity J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212 :1345-1360 Crossref Scopus (854) PubMed Google Scholar ). Older reports have shown that polyamine synthesis is a hallmark of T cell activation and proliferation ( Bowlin et al., 1987 6. Bowlin, T.L. ∙ McKown, B.J. ∙ Babcock, G.F. ... Intracellular polyamine biosynthesis is required for interleukin 2 responsiveness during lymphocyte mitogenesis Cell.

Trans. 1985; 13 :934-935 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ) but its functional implications have not been widely investigated. In mammalian cells, the pool of polyamines comprises putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. During polyamine synthesis, the amino acid ornithine is converted to putrescine by the rate limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Putrescine can then be metabolized to spermidine and eventually spermine.
In this study, we investigate the role of polyamine metabolism in CD4 + T cell differentiation and function. We show that loss of polyamine synthesis leads to profound changes in the ability of CD4 + T cells to dependably differentiate into functionally distinct subsets. Our data suggest the importance of polyamine metabolism in directing T H subset specification lies in the role of spermidine acting as a substrate for the synthesis of the amino acid hypusine. Deletion of ODC, or the enzymes responsible for hypusine synthesis, results in dramatic epigenomic changes, driven by enhanced histone acetylation. These data place the polyamine-hypusine axis in a position of central importance in CD4 + T cell differentiation.

Section: Results

Polyamine metabolism requires ODC ( Figure 1 A). ODC expression and intracellular polyamines increased after CD4 + T cell activation ( Figures 1 B and 1C). We also questioned if polyamine synthesis was active in differentiated T H subsets. We isolated naive CD4 + T cells from C57BL/6 mice and polarized them into T H 1, T H 2, T H 17, and T reg cell subsets ( Zhu et al., 2010 73. Zhu, J. ∙ Yamane, H. ∙ Paul, W.E. Differentiation of effector CD4 T cell populations ( ∗ ) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28 :445-489 Crossref Scopus (2584) PubMed Google Scholar ), then assessed ODC, spermidine synthase (SRM), and spermine synthase (SMS) expression. All three enzymes were expressed across T H subsets, although levels were reduced in T H 17 and T regs relative to T H 1 and T H 2 cells ( Figures 1 D, 1E, and S1 A). Arginine is a major substrate for polyamine synthesis, and we exposed cells to 13 C arginine to assess its movement through polyamines in T H subsets. Although 13 C arginine accumulated in polyamines in T H 1 and T H 2 cells, this accumulation was significantly lower in T regs and virtually absent in T H 17 cells ( Figures 1 F and S1 B). However, we observed similar polyamine abundance across T H subsets, except in T H 17 cells, which had lower putrescine and spermine ( Figure 1 G). These data imply that polyamine synthesis is active in T H cells, but some subsets, particularly T H 17 cells and T regs , may use substrates other than arginine for polyamines.
Glutamine, arginine, and proline are also substrates for polyamine synthesis, whereas methionine acts as a substrate for spermidine and spermine ( Figure S1 C). We polarized naive CD4 + T cells into T H 1, T H 2, T H 17, and T regs and exposed them to 13 C-glucose, 13 C-glutamine, 13 C-arginine, 13 C-proline, or 15 N-methionine for 24 h. Putrescine was synthesized equally from arginine and glutamine in T H 1 and T H 2 cells, whereas glutamine was the dominant substrate in T regs . T H 17 cells did not utilize any of these substrates ( Figure 1 H). For spermidine, methionine, arginine, and glutamine were the dominant substrates compared to just methionine and glutamine in T regs . Only a fraction of these substrates contributed to spermidine in T H 17 cells ( Figure 1 H). Methionine was the main metabolite utilized for spermine synthesis across T H subsets. Glucose and proline were not significant substrates for polyamine synthesis in CD4 + T H cells ( Figure 1 H). These data suggest that T H 17, and to a lesser extent T regs , may exhibit diminished flux through the polyamine pathway relative to T H 1 and T H 2 cells.
Because the polyamine pool remained relatively consistent across T H subsets ( Figure 1 G), despite disparities in metabolic flux and substrate choice ( Figure 1 H), we questioned if exogenous uptake of polyamines contributes to intracellular polyamine levels. We assessed the fraction of intracellular putrescine and spermidine derived from exogenous 13 C putrescine in T H cells. When cells were exposed to 500 μM 13 C putrescine, ∼90% and 40% of the putrescine and spermidine pool, respectively, derived from exogenous putrescine ( Figure 1 I). Even at a 10-fold lower concentration, exogenous putrescine contributed ∼50% and 30% to the putrescine and spermidine pool, respectively. All T H subsets had an equal ability to acquire putrescine ( Figure 1 I). Therefore, polyamine influx from the microenvironment may contribute significantly to intracellular polyamine levels. This could be particularly important for T H 17 cells and T regs , which may have lower polyamine synthesis.
To test if cytokines control polyamine metabolism, we cultured CD4 + T cells with 13 C arginine and combinations of cytokines and blocking antibodies ( Figure S1 D). Using CD4 + T cells activated only with anti-CD3/CD28 and treated with IFN-γ and IL-4 blocking antibodies as a baseline, we found that IL-2, IL-12, or IL-4 enhanced arginine flux into putrescine and spermidine, while this was diminished in cells treated with IL-6, or transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), or both ( Figure 1 J). The negative impact of IL-6 on polyamine metabolism was reversed when cells were additionally treated with IL-23 and IL-1β ( Figure 1 J), conditions associated with pathogenic T H 17 cell development, suggesting that polyamine metabolism may influence the balance between pathogenic and non-pathogenic T H 17 states. These data confirm that immune factors in the local milieu regulate CD4 + T H cell polyamine metabolism and suggest a role for polyamine synthesis in their differentiation.
To examine polyamine metabolism in CD4 + T H differentiation, we bred mice with loxP flanked exons 9–11 of Odc with mice expressing CD4 cre , to generate mice with Odc specifically deleted in T cells ( Odc -ΔT mice). Control mice were absent for cre recombinase. ODC was deleted in T cells from Odc -ΔT mice ( Figure 2 A). Odc -ΔT mice displayed comparable CD4 + and CD8 + T cell frequencies and numbers in spleen, and naive and memory cells within the CD4 + T cell compartment, relative to wild-type (WT) littermates ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Importantly, Odc − / − CD4 + T cells had reduced intracellular polyamine levels after activation in vitro ( Figure 2 B). We sorted naive CD4 + T cells from Odc -ΔT mice and polarized them into T H subsets in vitro . After 4 days, we restimulated cells and measured intracellular cytokines. Irrespective of polarizing condition, Odc −/− T cells displayed elevated levels of the hallmark T H 1 cytokine IFN-γ and an increased frequency of cells producing both IFN-γ and IL-17A, the canonical T H 17 cytokine ( Figures 2 C and S1 G). Odc −/− T H 1 and T H 2 cells had an increased frequency of cells co-producing the T H 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 ( Figure 2 D), and remarkably, an increase in cells co-producing IFN-γ and IL-13 across all Odc −/− T H subsets ( Figure 2 D). Although IL-17A expression increased in T H 1, T H 2, and T reg cultures, it decreased under T H 17 conditions ( Figure 2 C). Thus, in the absence of Odc , T H cells express non-canonical cytokines in a highly dysregulated manner, even when activated in polarizing conditions that normally faithfully direct T H cell subset specification.
Next, we measured lineage-specific TFs in WT and Odc − /− CD4 + T cells under different polarizing conditions. T-bet, the T H 1 TF ( Szabo et al., 2000 63. Szabo, S.J. ∙ Kim, S.T. ∙ Costa, G.L. ... A novel transcription factor, T-bet, directs Th1 lineage commitment Cell. 2000; 100 :655-669 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2924) PubMed Google Scholar ), was aberrantly expressed in Odc −/− T H 2, T H 17, and T reg cells, whereas GATA3, the T H 2 TF, was increased in T H 1 and T H 17 cells ( Figure 2 E). Odc deletion also induced the abnormal expression of Foxp3, the T reg cell TF, under T H 17 conditions ( Figure 2 E). Odc −/− CD4 + T cells not exposed to polarizing cytokines, i.e., activated solely with anti-CD3/CD28 plus IL-2, or with the addition of IFN-γ and IL-4 blocking antibodies (T H 0), also displayed significantly increased IFN-γ, T-bet, and Foxp3 ( Figure S1 H). The simultaneous expression of multiple lineage-defining TFs and cytokines in polyamine-deficient T H cells implies that polyamine metabolism is central to correct lineage commitment.
To determine if Odc −/− CD4 + T cell failure to correctly identify a T H lineage was exacerbated by dysregulated cytokines feeding back in an autocrine manner, we exposed T H 17 cells to increasing concentrations of cytokine blocking antibodies. Simultaneously blocking IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 enhanced IL-17A production in WT T H 17 cells, but did not restore IL-17A in Odc −/− T H 17 cells ( Figure S1 I). Cytokine blocking did not correct aberrant Odc −/− T H 17 cell GATA expression, but reduced T-bet and Foxp3, although not to WT levels ( Figure S1 I). Loss of polyamine synthesis compromises T cell proliferation ( Wang et al., 2011 65. Wang, R. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ∙ Shi, L.Z. ... The transcription factor Myc controls metabolic reprogramming upon T lymphocyte activation Immunity. 2011; 35 :871-882 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1564) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fewer Odc −/− T cells were present at the end of in vitro culture relative to WT cells across T H subsets ( Figure S1 J), although Odc deletion delayed rather than prevented proliferation ( Figure S1 K). IFN-γ and T-bet were dysregulated in all Odc −/− T H subsets regardless of cell division ( Figures S1 L and S2 A). Subset specification defects were exacerbated with increasing cell division ( Figures S1 L and S2 A), suggesting that defective proliferation in polyamine-deficient T cells does not underlie their inability to successfully identify a T H fate.
To confirm that defective putrescine synthesis underlies the phenotype of Odc −/− T cells, we treated cells with exogenous putrescine. Putrescine addition restored the ectopic expression of cytokines and TFs of Odc −/− T H 17 cells to WT levels ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S2 B).
Odc -ΔT mice appeared normal in terms of health and peripheral T cell numbers in steady state ( Figure S1 E), but in vitro -activated Odc −/− T cells displayed profound dysregulation ( Figures 2 C–2E). To explore this in vivo , we used a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease where transfer of naive CD4 + T cells into RAG1-deficient mice, which lack their own lymphocytes, drives colitis ( Powrie et al., 1993 50. Powrie, F. ∙ Leach, M.W. ∙ Mauze, S. ... Phenotypically distinct subsets of CD4+ T cells induce or protect from chronic intestinal inflammation in C. B-17 scid mice Int. Immunol. 1993; 5 :1461-1471 Crossref Scopus (949) PubMed Google Scholar ). We transferred 4 × 10 5 naive CD4 + T cells from WT and Odc -ΔT mice into Rag1 −/− recipient mice. After 3 weeks, Rag1 −/− mice that received Odc −/− T cells began losing weight and declined until 36 days post T cell transfer when the experiment was terminated due to weight loss and diarrhea ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Although colon length was comparable between mice that received either WT (WT → Rag1 −/− ) or Odc −/− T cells ( Odc −/− → Rag1 −/− ) ( Figure 3 C), only mice containing Odc −/− T cells showed macroscopic signs of inflammation, characterized by colonic wall thickening ( Figure 3 D).
We found increased number and frequency of T cells expressing IFN-γ and reduced number and frequency of IL-17A-, IL-17F,- and IL-17A/IL-17F-expressing cells in the colon and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of Odc −/− → Rag1 −/− recipient mice relative to WT → Rag1 −/− controls ( Figure 3 E and S2 C). A higher frequency of T cells expressed T-bet in the colon of Odc −/− → Rag1 −/− mice, whereas the frequency of T cells expressing RORγt was reduced ( Figure 3 F). The frequency and number of T cells expressing Foxp3 and CD25, T reg cell markers, in the colon and MLN was comparable between WT → Rag1 −/− and Odc −/− → Rag1 −/− mice ( Figures S2 E and S2F). These data confirmed a critical role for ODC in ensuring correct T H lineage fidelity both in vitro and in vivo .
We further tested the role of polyamine synthesis with an in vivo model of T H 17 induction in the small intestine. Anti-CD3 antibody treatment drives activation induced cell death in T cells and subsequent engulfment of apoptotic T cells by macrophages leads to IL-6 and TGF-β production, cytokines important for T H 17 cell development ( Esplugues et al., 2011 17. Esplugues, E. ∙ Huber, S. ∙ Gagliani, N. ... Control of TH17 cells occurs in the small intestine Nature. 2011; 475 :514-518 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). These conditions lead to small intestine inflammation and robust T H 17 cell formation ( Esplugues et al., 2011 17. Esplugues, E. ∙ Huber, S. ∙ Gagliani, N. ... Control of TH17 cells occurs in the small intestine Nature. 2011; 475 :514-518 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). Anti-CD3 treatment of WT mice increased small intestine CD4 + T cells expressing IL-17A, IL-17F, and co-expressing these cytokines ( Figures 3 G and S2 G). However, both the frequency and number of CD4 + T cells expressing IL-17A and IL-17A/IL-17F was significantly lower in Odc -ΔT mice following anti-CD3 treatment ( Figures 3 G and S2 G). Following anti-CD3 treatment, more than 70% of small intestine CD4 + T cells in WT mice expressed RORγt, but the number and frequency was lower in Odc -ΔT mice ( Figures 3 H and S2 H). These data suggest a crucial role for polyamine metabolism in T H 17 cell formation in vivo .
Polyamines have pleiotropic roles ( Igarashi and Kashiwagi, 2000 31. Igarashi, K. ∙ Kashiwagi, K. Polyamines: mysterious modulators of cellular functions Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271 :559-564 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ), but a key function of this pathway is synthesis of the amino acid hypusine ( Chattopadhyay et al., 2008 13. Chattopadhyay, M.K. ∙ Park, M.H. ∙ Tabor, H. Hypusine modification for growth is the major function of spermidine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae polyamine auxotrophs grown in limiting spermidine Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :6554-6559 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hypusine is present in just one protein—the translation elongation factor eIF5A ( Park et al., 1981 47. Park, M.H. ∙ Cooper, H.L. ∙ Folk, J.E. Identification of hypusine, an unusual amino acid, in a protein from human lymphocytes and of spermidine as its biosynthetic precursor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78 :2869-2873 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ), and hypusination is critical to eIF5A’s translation factor function. eIF5A is hypusinated when a conserved lysine (K50) is converted to hypusine by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) in a process requiring spermidine ( Figure 4 A) ( Abbruzzese et al., 1986 1. Abbruzzese, A. ∙ Park, M.H. ∙ Folk, J.E. Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase from rat testis. Partial purification and characterization J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261 :3085-3089 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Park et al., 1981 47. Park, M.H. ∙ Cooper, H.L. ∙ Folk, J.E. Identification of hypusine, an unusual amino acid, in a protein from human lymphocytes and of spermidine as its biosynthetic precursor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78 :2869-2873 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wolff et al., 1995 69. Wolff, E.C. ∙ Lee, Y.B. ∙ Chung, S.I. ... Deoxyhypusine synthase from rat testis: purification and characterization J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 :8660-8666 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, spermidine is a substrate for DHPS, which mediates the first, rate limiting step in hypusine synthesis. We questioned whether the mechanism through which polyamines control T H cell subset fidelity is via spermidine production and eIF5A hypusination. Both eIF5A and its hypusinated form (eIF5A H ) increased after CD4 + T cell activation ( Figure 4 B). eIF5A H , but not total eIF5A, was decreased in Odc −/− CD4 + T cells ( Figure 4 C), highlighting the relationship between polyamines and eIF5A H .
We reasoned that if hypusine was important for T H differentiation, putrescine add-back would no longer rescue the Odc −/− T cell phenotype if DHPS was absent. We generated WT and Odc −/− T H 17 cells in which some cells were also deleted for Dhps using CRISPR-Cas9. Guides targeting Dhps (g Dhps ) ablated DHPS in WT and Odc −/− T H 17 cells compared to cells with control guides (gCTRL) ( Figure 4 D). Dhps deletion in WT T H 17 cells reduced eIF5A H , but not total eIF5A levels ( Figure 4 D). As observed in Figure 4 C, Odc −/− T cells had reduced eIF5A H with or without DHPS ( Figure 4 D). Importantly, putrescine restored eIF5A H in Odc −/− T cells with gCTRL, but not in Odc −/− T cells lacking Dhps ( Figure 4 D).
Dhps deletion in WT T H 17 cells increased IFN-γ ( Figure 4 E), phenocopying Odc knockout. As in Figure 2 F, putrescine restored IFN-γ expression back to WT levels in Odc −/− T H 17 cells, but not in Dhps -deleted Odc −/− T H 17 cells ( Figure 4 E). Moreover, Dhps deletion in WT T H 17 cells abolished IL-17A, again phenocopying Odc −/− T H 17 cells. Exposing Odc −/− T H 17 cells to putrescine restored IL-17A synthesis, an effect lost when Dhps was absent ( Figure 4 E). These data demonstrate that hypusine synthesis, via DHPS, is central to how polyamine metabolism enforces T H lineage fidelity.
If hypusine synthesis was important, deletion of the hypusine synthesis enzyme DOHH should phenocopy Odc and Dhps loss with aberrant T H differentiation. We crossed mice containing loxP flanked exons 2–4 of Dohh ( Sievert et al., 2014 62. Sievert, H. ∙ Pällmann, N. ∙ Miller, K.K. ... A novel mouse model for inhibition of DOHH-mediated hypusine modification reveals a crucial function in embryonic development, proliferation and oncogenic transformation Dis. Model. Mech. 2014; 7 :963-976 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) with mice expressing CD4 cre , to generate mice with Dohh deleted in T cells ( Dohh -ΔT mice). Control mice were absent for cre recombinase. DOHH deletion in T cells decreased eIF5A H , but not total eIF5A ( Figure S2 I). Dohh -ΔT mice exhibited a ∼50% reduction in T cell frequency and number in spleen relative to WT littermates ( Figure S2 J), although naive and memory CD4 + T cell frequencies were comparable ( Figure S2 K).
We sorted naive CD4 + T cells from Dohh -ΔT mice and activated and polarized them in vitro into T H 1, T H 2, T H 17, and T reg cells. IFN-γ was remarkably elevated in Dohh −/− T H 2, T H 17, and T reg cells ( Figure 5 A). There was also an increased frequency of cells that co-produced IFN-γ and IL-17A in all T H cell subsets ( Figure 5 A) and enhanced secretion of IFN-γ and IL-17A together with other cytokines (TNF, IL-22, and IL-6) in Dohh −/− T cells ( Figures S2 L and S2M). We also observed an increased frequency of cells expressing IL-5 and/or IL-13 in Dohh −/− T cells under T H 2 conditions ( Figures 5 B and S3 A), including a population of cells co-producing IFN-γ and IL-13 in T H 2 and T H 17 conditions ( Figure 5 B). Similar to Odc −/− T cells ( Figure 2 C), IL-17A expression was ablated in Dohh −/− T H 17 cells ( Figure 5 A).
To test if Dohh −/− T H cells had dysregulated cytokine expression without restimulation, we crossed Dohh -ΔT to Great mice containing an IRES-enhanced YFP construct after the IFN-γ stop codon ( Reinhardt et al., 2009 55. Reinhardt, R.L. ∙ Liang, H.-E. ∙ Locksley, R.M. Cytokine-secreting follicular T cells shape the antibody repertoire Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10 :385-393 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). This allows expression of both IFN-γ and eYFP from the same mRNA and analysis of IFN-γ-expressing cells without restimulation. We polarized naive CD4 + T cells from Dohh -ΔT-Great mice into various T H cells and assessed eYFP expression after 4 days. Naive CD4 + T cells from littermates that expressed Great alleles, but lacked cre recombinase, were controls. All T H subsets displayed enhanced IFN-γ in the absence of DOHH ( Figure S3 B), suggesting that the dysregulated cytokine response in Dohh −/− T H cells is apparent prior to, and in the absence of, restimulation.
We also found increased T-bet in Dohh −/− T cells under all polarizing conditions and an increased frequency of GATA3 expressing cells in T H 1 and T H 17 conditions ( Figure 5 C). There was dysregulated Foxp3 in all T H subsets and a reduced frequency of RORγt-expressing cells under T H 17 conditions ( Figure 5 C). Cytokine and TF expression was also aberrant when cells were activated solely with anti-CD3/CD28 and IL-2 or also exposed to IFN-γ and IL-4 blocking antibodies (T H 0) ( Figure S3 C). Even under increasing concentrations of blocking antibodies targeting numerous cytokines, many lineage-specific TFs were still perturbed in Dohh −/− T H 17 cells and IL-17A expression could not be restored to WT levels ( Figure S3 D). Like Odc −/− T H cells, Dohh loss delayed T cell expansion ( Figures S3 E and S3F), and IFN-γ and T-bet levels were altered across all Dohh −/− T H cells subsets regardless of cell division ( Figures S4 A and S4B).
The robust phenotypic overlap between Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells strongly supports that the requirement for polyamine metabolism in enforcing T H cell lineage fidelity is due to spermidine acting as a substrate for hypusine synthesis.
Remarkably, Dohh -ΔT mice died at ∼10–17 weeks of age ( Figure 5 D). IFN-γ and other cytokines were significantly increased in the serum of Dohh -ΔT mice ( Figures S4 C and S4D), correlating with disease. Colon length was decreased in Dohh -ΔT mice ( Figure 5 E), accompanied by increased immune infiltrates, altered villi structure ( Figure 5 F), and cecal thickening ( Figure 5 G), indicative of colitis, a T cell-driven pathology ( Powrie et al., 1994 51.

Inhibition of Th1 responses prevents inflammatory bowel disease in scid mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi CD4+ T cells Immunity. 1994; 1 :553-562 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1028) PubMed Google Scholar ). T cells isolated from various organs of Dohh -ΔT mice displayed increased frequencies of CD4 + T cells producing IFN-γ, and IFN-γ and/or IL-17 ( Figures 5 H and S4 E), directly correlating intestinal inflammation with increased cytokine-producing T cells in vivo ( Harbour et al., 2015 25.

Pathogen-induced human TH17 cells produce IFN-γ or IL-10 and are regulated by IL-1β Nature. 2012; 484 :514-518 Crossref Scopus (770) PubMed Google Scholar ). T cells isolated from colon and lung of Dohh -ΔT-Great mice had enhanced IFN-γ relative to WT controls even without restimulation ( Figure S4 F). Notably, Dohh -ΔT mice had an increased frequency of CD4 + T cells expressing T-bet and/or RORγt in the colon or spleen ( Figure S4 G), without any difference in the frequency of Foxp3-expressing T cells ( Figure S4 H).
The similar Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cell phenotypes indicated that polyamine synthesis in T H cell subset specification was mechanistically linked to hypusine synthesis. We reasoned that we should therefore observe a similar phenotype to Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells in a third genetic model - Dhps deficiency ( Figure 4 A). We crossed mice containing loxP flanked exons 2-7 of the Dhps gene ( Pällmann et al., 2015 46. Pällmann, N. ∙ Braig, M. ∙ Sievert, H. ... Biological Relevance and Therapeutic Potential of the Hypusine Modification System J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :18343-18360 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) with mice expressing CD4 cre , to generate mice deleted for Dhps in T cells ( Dhps -ΔT mice). Control mice were absent for cre recombinase. Deletion of DHPS in T cells decreased eIF5A H but not total eIF5A ( Figure S5 A). Like Dohh -ΔT mice, Dhps -ΔT mice had reduced T cell frequency and numbers in spleen ( Figure S5 B), although had they enhanced effector memory CD4 + T cell frequency ( Figure S5 C). Like Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells, in vitro activated Dhps -ΔT CD4 + T cells exhibited markedly elevated IFN-γ, with increased frequencies of cells producing both IFN-γ and IL-17A while IL-17A synthesis was defective in the T H 17 lineage ( Figure S5 D). Lineage-defining TF expression was dysregulated across all T H subsets ( Figure S5 E). As with Dohh -ΔT mice, two independently generated Dhps -ΔT mouse lines in distinct animal facilities developed fatal disease at around 10–20 weeks of age ( Figure S5 F) with intestinal inflammation as measured by decreased colon length ( Figure S5 G). Dhps -ΔT mice also displayed increased frequencies of IFN-γ, and IFN-γ and/or IL-17 producing CD4 + T cells in the lung, colon, and spleen ( Figure S5 H), with increased T-bet and/or RORγt expression in multiple tissues ( Figures S5 I and S5J), correlating with their inflammatory phenotype ( Harbour et al., 2015 25. Harbour, S.N. ∙ Maynard, C.L. ∙ Zindl, C.L. ... Th17 cells give rise to Th1 cells that are required for the pathogenesis of colitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Invest. 2006; 116 :1310-1316 Crossref Scopus (1321) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet no change in Foxp3-expressing cells ( Figure S5 K).
To test if failed suppression of aberrant T cell activity by T regs contributed to the fatal inflammation in Dohh -ΔT and Dhps -ΔT mice, we transferred naive WT CD45.1 + CD4 + T cells into Rag1 −/− recipients to initiate colitis, together with T regs sorted from WT and Dohh -ΔT mice. In this model, co-transfer of T regs protects against disease ( Mottet et al., 2003 41. Mottet, C. ∙ Uhlig, H.H. ∙ Powrie, F. Cutting edge: cure of colitis by CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells J. Immunol. 2003; 170 :3939-3943 Crossref Scopus (822) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transfer of naive CD4 + T cells alone efficiently induced colitis in recipient mice, limiting survival ( Figure 5 I). Co-transfer of WT T regs shielded recipient mice from disease ( Figure 5 I), but Dohh − /− T reg transfer had no such effect, and recipient mice died at the same rate as mice that received no T regs ( Figure 5 I). We found similar numbers of WT and Dohh −/− T regs in surviving recipient mice 113 days post-transfer ( Figure 5 J), suggesting lost suppressive function in Dohh −/− T regs rather than impaired proliferation or survival of these cells. This was highlighted by the ability of WT, but not Dohh −/− , T regs to suppress naive CD45.1 + T cell expansion in recipient mice ( Figure 5 K). Therefore, the T cell-driven pathology in Dohh -ΔT and Dhps -ΔT mice likely reflects a cell-intrinsic failure of CD4 + T cells to faithfully regulate effector differentiation, coupled to a loss of T reg tolerogenic competence. Collectively, these data suggest that hypusine synthesis is a critical factor controlling T H differentiation and function both in vitro and in vivo where loss of this factor drives aberrant T cell responses and systemic inflammation.
In addition to selective TF and cytokine expression, a key feature of T H cell differentiation is the ability of one program to silence other T H effector fates (e.g., T H 1 cells not only produce IFN-γ but repress IL-4 and IL-17 synthesis). Various transcriptomic and epigenomic mechanisms underlie this lineage commitment fidelity ( Kanno et al., 2012 32. Kanno, Y. ∙ Vahedi, G. ∙ Hirahara, K. ... Transcriptional and epigenetic control of T helper cell specification: molecular mechanisms underlying commitment and plasticity Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :707-731 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because Odc- , Dohh- , and Dhps -deficient T cells displayed attributes of multiple T H lineages simultaneously, we reasoned these cells likely had wide-scale transcriptomic/epigenomic changes. We examined gene transcription by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), finding a dramatically altered transcriptional profile in both Odc −/− and Dohh −/− cells relative to WT cells across all T H cell subsets ( Figure 6 A) with many genes commonly differentially regulated in both genotypes ( Figure 6 B) including essential differentiation and effector function genes ( Figure S6 A). Epigenetic status is an important regulator of gene expression and cellular differentiation ( Allis and Jenuwein, 2016 3. Allis, C.D. ∙ Jenuwein, T. The molecular hallmarks of epigenetic control Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :487-500 Crossref Scopus (1732) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate if chromatin changes drove transcriptional perturbations in Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H cells, we performed ATAC-seq across genotypes and T H cell subsets. Chromatin accessibility, which influences the access of T H cell subset-specific TFs driving expression of lineage-specific genes ( Hirahara et al., 2011 28. Hirahara, K. ∙ Vahedi, G. ∙ Ghoreschi, K. ... Helper T-cell differentiation and plasticity: insights from epigenetics Immunology. 2011; 134 :235-245 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), was highly disparate between all Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H cell subsets compared to WT cells ( Figure 6 C). Across T H cell subsets, many differentially regulated chromatin regions were shared between Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H cells ( Figure 6 D), including loci critical for T H cell differentiation and lineage identity, such as Tbx21 (T-Bet), Gata3 , Rorc , Ifng , and Il17 ( Figure S6 B). These data show that Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells exhibit substantially remodeled chromatin and indicate a prominent role for the polyamine-hypusine axis in governing the T cell epigenome.
To examine what initiated altered chromatin accessibility, we measured epigenetic marks on histone proteins, including activating modifications such as H3k4me 3 , H3k9Ac, H3k27Ac, and H3k36me 3 , and the repressive mark H3k9me 3 ( Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011 4. Bannister, A.J. ∙ Kouzarides, T. Regulation of chromatin by histone modifications Cell Res. 2011; 21 :381-395 Crossref Scopus (4154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lawrence et al., 2016 36. Lawrence, M. ∙ Daujat, S. ∙ Schneider, R. Lateral Thinking: How Histone Modifications Regulate Gene Expression Trends Genet. 2016; 32 :42-56 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (593) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many histone marks were dysregulated in all Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H cell subsets, compared to WT cells ( Figures 6 E and S6 C).
Next, we sought to address if this altered chromatin was apparent in naive T cells or was coupled to T cell activation. ATAC-seq of splenic naive T cells of Dohh -ΔT mice and their WT littermates revealed a level of chromatin remodeling already present in naive Dohh −/− T cells, although we did not observe changes in chromatin accessibility in any T H lineage commitment-relevant loci, with the exception of Il6 ( Figure 6 F). Remodeling in naive Dohh −/− T cells (2,388 differentially regulated regions) was comparatively minor compared to that of differentiated Dohh −/− T H subsets (9,745–14,978 differentially regulated regions). To confirm that expression of factors associated with T H differentiation was not already differentially regulated in naive Dohh −/− T cells, we used Dohh -ΔT-Great mice to assess IFN-γ in naive and effector CD4 + T cells. IFN-γ-YFP expression was restricted solely to CD44-expressing effector CD4 + T cells in the colon, spleen, and lungs of both Dohh -ΔT-great mice and WT littermate controls ( Figure 6 G). These data suggest that although chromatin dynamics are altered in Dohh −/− naive T cells, the major remodeling during perturbed T H differentiation is coupled to T cell activation.
T-bet can regulate T H 1 differentiation by recruiting chromatin modifying enzymes promoting permissive chromatin marks at loci required for the T H 1 program ( Lazarevic et al., 2013 37. Lazarevic, V. ∙ Glimcher, L.H. ∙ Lord, G.M. T-bet: a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :777-789 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H cells have increased T-bet, which could promote chromatin modifying enzyme recruitment. We polarized Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells under T H 17 conditions and used CRISPR-Cas9 to ablate Tbx21 (encoding T-bet). Although Tbx21 -deletion was efficient ( Figure S6 D) and reduced IFN-γ expression to WT levels ( Figure S6 E), T-bet-deficient Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells still lacked T H 17 lineage commitment, highlighted by increased GATA3 and Foxp3 ( Figure S6 F). Moreover, maintaining IL-17 synthesis requires inhibition of T-bet expression ( Kanno et al., 2012 32. Kanno, Y. ∙ Vahedi, G. ∙ Hirahara, K. ... Transcriptional and epigenetic control of T helper cell specification: molecular mechanisms underlying commitment and plasticity Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :707-731 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lazarevic et al., 2013 37. Lazarevic, V. ∙ Glimcher, L.H. ∙ Lord, G.M. T-bet: a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :777-789 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ), but reducing aberrant T-bet levels in Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H 17 cells failed to restore IL-17A ( Figure S7 A).
We also assessed T H 1 differentiation in Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells lacking T-bet ( Figure S7 B). Tbx21 deletion abrogated IFN-γ expression in WT T H 1 cells, but had remarkably little impact on IFN-γ synthesis in Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H 1 cells ( Figures 6 H and 6I), a phenomenon also seen when we deleted Tbx21 in naive T cells isolated from Dohh -ΔT-Great mice and polarized under T H 1 conditions. Although Tbx21 -deletion nullified IFN-γ-YFP expression in WT T H 1 cells, T-bet-deficient Dohh −/− T H 1 cells still expressed significant IFN-γ-YFP, even without restimulation ( Figure S7 C). These data suggest that in some contexts, T-bet is not an absolute requirement for CD4 + T cell IFN-γ production. The capacity of Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H 1 cells to synthesize IFN-γ in the absence of T-bet likely reflects remodeling at the Ifng locus such that T-bet binding is no longer mandatory for IFN-γ transcription, supporting the notion that polyamine metabolism, via hypusine synthesis, is a central regulator of the T cell epigenome. This observation also suggests that the dramatic dysregulation of T-bet expression in polyamine- and hypusine-deficient T H cells does not explain aberrant T H differentiation.
We reasoned that if chromatin dysregulation in Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells was driven by observed changes in histone marks ( Figure 6 E), reducing histone acetylation should restore canonical expression of cytokines and TFs. We exposed Dohh −/− T cells to C646, an inhibitor of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) P300 that mediates H3k27 acetylation, a dysregulated mark in Dohh −/− T cells. Treating Dohh −/− T cells with C646 restored IFN-γ and T-bet levels across T H subsets to WT levels ( Figure S7 D) and reduced H3k27 acetylation ( Figure S7 E). We then examined if ablating P300 could also restore correct T H differentiation in T cells deficient for polyamine or hypusine synthesis. T cells with guides specific for P300 ( gP300 ) displayed reduced P300 protein compared to T cells with gCTRL ( Figure 7 A). P300 deletion reduced IFN-γ and T-bet in both Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H 17 cells ( Figure 7 B) but did not restore IL-17A ( Figure S7 F). Notably, reducing P300 diminished H3k27 acetylation in WT and Odc −/− T H 17 cells ( Figures 7 C and S7 G).
H3k9 acetylation was also dysregulated in Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H cells ( Figure 6 E). To probe if reducing H3k9 acetylation could restore normal T H lineage commitment, we inhibited the HAT KAT2A, which mediates H3k9 acetylation in T cells ( Castillo et al., 2019 11. Castillo, J. ∙ Wu, E. ∙ Lowe, C. ...

The KAT2A inhibitor CPTH2 reduced IFN-γ in Odc −/− T cells in all subsets ( Figure S7 H). KAT2A deletion in WT and Odc −/− T H 17 cells ( Figure 7 D) reduced H3k9 acetylation ( Figure 7 E) and abolished dysregulated IFN-γ and T-bet expression in Odc −/− T H 17 cells ( Figure 7 F), but did not recover IL-17A or RORγt ( Figure S7 I). These data imply a key role for aberrant histone acetylation, driven by HATs, in the chromatin remodeling that occurs in the absence of polyamine metabolism and/or hypusine synthesis.
Our data suggested that aberrant histone acetylation drove the chromatin alterations precluding Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells from competent T H lineage commitment. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a central metabolic hub that generates acetyl-CoA, a HAT substrate for histone acetylation. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) converts the TCA cycle metabolite citrate to acetyl-CoA. We traced carbons from 13 C glucose into TCA cycle metabolites in WT and Odc −/− T H cells. Although glucose was metabolized with largely equal efficiency to pyruvate and citrate in WT and Odc −/− T H cells, there was a significant reduction in glucose carbons found in α-ketoglutarate, 2-HG, and succinate—metabolites synthesized after citrate in the TCA cycle ( Figure 7 G). Glucose-derived carbons in TCA metabolites post-citrate were also decreased in activated Dohh −/− CD4 + T cells ( Figure 7 H).
We reasoned that if the TCA cycle of Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T cells was perturbed at citrate, we might see anaplerotic replenishment of the cycle through glutamine catabolism to α-ketoglutarate, a step immediately after citrate. The contribution of carbons from 13 C glutamine to TCA metabolites was increased in Odc −/− T H subsets ( Figure S7 J), and activated Dohh −/− T cells ( Figures S7 K). These data suggest loss of the polyamine-hypusine axis remodels the TCA cycle, with decreased glucose oxidation post-citrate and enhanced fueling of the cycle by glutamine.
Next, we questioned if this altered TCA cycle, was due to preferential citrate metabolism to acetyl-CoA, rather than the next step in the TCA cycle. As acetyl-CoA is a HAT substrate, we pondered if increased citrate flux to acetyl-CoA accounted for the defective T H lineage commitment in polyamine-deficient T cells that our data suggested was due to excessive histone acetylation. We exposed WT and Odc −/− T H 17 cells to the ACLY inhibitor BMS303141. ACLY inhibition restored the aberrant IFN-γ observed in Odc −/− T H 17 cells back to WT levels ( Figure 7 I). Genetically deleting Acly in WT and Odc −/− T H 17 cells with Acly guides (g Acly ) reduced ACLY protein compared to gCTRL cells ( Figure 7 J), and Odc −/− T H 17 cells lacking ACLY displayed reduced IFN-γ and T-bet, indicative of corrected lineage commitment ( Figure 7 K). These observations intimate that loss of polyamine metabolism, and with it hypusine synthesis, rewires the TCA cycle, likely increasing citrate flux to acetyl-CoA, helping to drive increased histone acetylation by HATs. The ultimate consequence of this is substantial transformation of the chromatin landscape that precludes T H cells from accurate lineage selection during differentiation.

Section: Discussion

We show here that polyamine metabolism is fundamental for faithful T H lineage commitment and this operates through spermidine acting as a substrate for eIF5A hypusination. This work agrees with recent reports that implicate polyamines in supporting CD4 + T cell effector programs ( Carriche et al., 2021 10. Carriche, G.M. ∙ Almeida, L. ∙ Stüve, P. ...

Adv. 2020; 6 :eabc4275 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that the polyamine-hypusine axis directs T H lineage commitment by ensuring the correct chromatin configuration is in place for T cell specification. T cells employ multiple epigenetic mechanisms to maintain accurate T H lineage commitment ( Kanno et al., 2012 32. Kanno, Y. ∙ Vahedi, G. ∙ Hirahara, K. ... Transcriptional and epigenetic control of T helper cell specification: molecular mechanisms underlying commitment and plasticity Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :707-731 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilson et al., 2009 68. Wilson, C.B. ∙ Rowell, E. ∙ Sekimata, M. Epigenetic control of T-helper-cell differentiation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9 :91-105 Crossref Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our study places polyamine metabolism as a critical regulator of the T cell epigenome. Similarly, Odc deletion in macrophages also results in increased inflammation due to altered histone modification ( Hardbower et al., 2017 26. Hardbower, D.M. ∙ Asim, M. ∙ Luis, P.B. ... Ornithine decarboxylase regulates M1 macrophage activation and mucosal inflammation via histone modifications Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E751-E760 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We report that histone acetylation is key to how polyamine metabolism controls the epigenome. Increased histone acetylation occurs at the IFN-γ and IL-4 loci during T H 1 and T H 2 differentiation, respectively. TCR signaling leads to initial remodeling and locus opening in a cytokine-independent fashion. Subsequently, cytokine signaling reinforces polarization by expanding and maintaining accessibility at relevant cytokine loci ( Fields et al., 2002 18. Fields, P.E. ∙ Kim, S.T. ∙ Flavell, R.A. Cutting edge: changes in histone acetylation at the IL-4 and IFN-gamma loci accompany Th1/Th2 differentiation J. Immunol. 2002; 169 :647-650 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our ATAC-seq experiments investigating chromatin accessibility suggest that polyamine metabolism governs this initial antigen-driven remodeling. In Odc −/− and Dohh −/− CD4 + T H cells this TCR-driven refashioning of the epigenome becomes flawed due to dysregulated histone acetylation. This is highlighted in Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H 0 cells in which lineage-specific TFs and cytokines are expressed merely in response to antigen stimulation. Although pharmacological or genetic ablation of specific HATs rescued many facets of T H differentiation in the absence of polyamine metabolism, it was impossible to restore IL-17 expression in T H 17 cells by modulating histone acetylation. This suggests that although the polyamine-hypusine axis controls the expression of numerous immune loci via the epigenome, its influence on IL-17 synthesis is through a different mechanism. eIF5A is a translation elongation factor assisting the translation of specific transcripts ( Gutierrez et al., 2013 24. Gutierrez, E. ∙ Shin, B.-S. ∙ Woolstenhulme, C.J. ... eIF5A promotes translation of polyproline motifs Mol. Cell. 2013; 51 :35-45 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pelechano and Alepuz, 2017 49.

Schuller, A.P. ∙ Wu, C.C.-C. ∙ Dever, T.E. ... eIF5A Functions Globally in Translation Elongation and Termination Mol. Cell. 2017; 66 :194-205.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). eIF5A may be involved directly in IL-17 transcript translation, possibly explaining why reducing histone acetylation in polyamine- or hypusine-deficient T H 17 cells is insufficient to restore IL-17 expression.
Dysregulated expression of non-canonical cytokines in all Odc −/− and Dohh −/− T H subsets suggests that the cross-inhibitory mechanisms that govern T H lineage fidelity are obsolete when polyamines are limiting. We believe this adds further support to a core role for polyamine metabolism in regulating the T cell epigenetic landscape. In vivo , CD4 + T cells can adopt features of multiple T H lineages simultaneously (e.g., T H 1 cytokine expression was observed in T H 17 cells and T regs in disease) ( Dominguez-Villar et al., 2011 15. Dominguez-Villar, M. ∙ Baecher-Allan, C.M. ∙ Hafler, D.A. Identification of T helper type 1-like, Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in human autoimmune disease Nat.

Fate mapping of IL-17-producing T cells in inflammatory responses Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :255-263 Crossref Scopus (928) PubMed Google Scholar ), and conversion of T regs into pathogenic T H 17 cells has been described in patients with autoimmune arthritis ( Komatsu et al., 2014 34. Komatsu, N. ∙ Okamoto, K. ∙ Sawa, S. ... Pathogenic conversion of Foxp3+ T cells into TH17 cells in autoimmune arthritis Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :62-68 Crossref Scopus (891) PubMed Google Scholar ). T-bet + Gata-3 + CD4 + T cells can occur in parasite infection ( Hegazy et al., 2010 27. Hegazy, A.N. ∙ Peine, M. ∙ Helmstetter, C. ... Interferons direct Th2 cell reprogramming to generate a stable GATA-3(+)T-bet(+) cell subset with combined Th2 and Th1 cell functions Immunity. 2010; 32 :116-128 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), and T-bet/RORγt double-positive cells have been seen in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models ( Ghoreschi et al., 2010 21. Ghoreschi, K. ∙ Laurence, A. ∙ Yang, X.-P. ... Generation of pathogenic T(H)17 cells in the absence of TGF-β signalling Nature. 2010; 467 :967-971 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nistala et al., 2010 45. Nistala, K. ∙ Adams, S. ∙ Cambrook, H. ... Th17 plasticity in human autoimmune arthritis is driven by the inflammatory environment Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :14751-14756 Crossref Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because we show here that polyamine metabolism limits ectopic expression of lineage-defining TFs and cytokines, restraints on polyamine synthesis or bioavailability in disease settings may promote these hybrid T cell populations that are often associated with pathogenesis. Indeed, this lack of T H lineage focus in Dohh- and Dhps -deficient T cells is sufficient to cause fatal inflammation in Dohh -ΔT and Dhps -ΔT mice. Because CD4-cre deletes in all cells expressing Cd4 during development, CD8 + T cells were also deficient in the polyamine-hypusine axis in our studies, and in initial analyses, these cells also exhibited dysregulated gene expression (data not shown). The contribution of these cells to the disease states described here remains to be determined. However, the colitis observed here in Dohh -ΔT and Dhps -ΔT mice is believed to be primarily CD4 + T cell-mediated ( Shale et al., 2013 61. Shale, M. ∙ Schiering, C. ∙ Powrie, F. CD4(+) T-cell subsets in intestinal inflammation Immunol. Rev. 2013; 252 :164-182 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ), and in the Odc −/− T cell transfer model purified CD4 + T cells alone accelerated colitis. Colitis manifested strongly in the hypusine-deficient mice, but was only conferred by T cell transfer in the ODC-deficient setting. T cells in Odc -ΔT mice may still acquire polyamines from the environment for hypusine synthesis, whereas Dohh - and Dhps -deficient T cells cannot make hypusine, even if polyamine substrates are present.
We propose that control of T H lineage fidelity by polyamine metabolism via the epigenome is ultimately driven by TCA cycle regulation. TCA cycle metabolites can impact the epigenome and T cell differentiation ( Tyrakis et al., 2016 64. Tyrakis, P.A. ∙ Palazon, A. ∙ Macias, D. ... S-2-hydroxyglutarate regulates CD8 + T-lymphocyte fate Nature. 2016; 540 :236-241 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously found the polyamine-hypusine pathway to be critical for TCA cycle integrity by maintaining mitochondrial and TCA cycle enzyme expression. Specifically, certain transcripts contained mitochondrial-targeting sequences that were hyper-dependent on eIF5A H for efficient translation. We identified perturbed TCA cycle flux after acute polyamine depletion or DHPS inhibition ( Puleston et al., 2019 52. Puleston, D.J. ∙ Buck, M.D. ∙ Klein Geltink, R.I. ... Polyamines and eIF5A Hypusination Modulate Mitochondrial Respiration and Macrophage Activation Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :352-363.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our current study, using models of chronic gene deletion of Odc , Dohh , and Dhps in T cells, we observed similarly perturbed TCA cycle metabolism. Overall, a picture emerges that polyamines and hypusine have specific effects on mitochondria, but determining how this regulation occurs requires further study. Functionally, eIF5A is a translation factor that when hypusinated preferentially regulates the translation of transcripts with specific sequence properties ( Gutierrez et al., 2013 24. Gutierrez, E. ∙ Shin, B.-S. ∙ Woolstenhulme, C.J. ... eIF5A promotes translation of polyproline motifs Mol. Cell. 2013; 51 :35-45 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pelechano and Alepuz, 2017 49.

Cell. 2017; 66 :194-205.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). The specific transcripts regulated by eIF5A in differentiating CD4 + T cells, and how their translation might impact the chromatin and transcriptional states of these cells, is a target of future research.
Given the established role of polyamines in controlling cell cycle ( Wang et al., 2011 65. Wang, R. ∙ Dillon, C.P. ∙ Shi, L.Z. ... The transcription factor Myc controls metabolic reprogramming upon T lymphocyte activation Immunity. 2011; 35 :871-882 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1564) PubMed Google Scholar ), we place this pathway as a central process coupling T cell proliferation and differentiation. Due to the ubiquity of polyamines, these ideas may extend beyond T cells—where polyamine metabolism could be crucial for supporting lineage selection across many cell types and may be of particular importance in stem cells where cell division and differentiation are robustly linked.
Our study demonstrates a role for the polyamine-hypusine axis in supporting CD4 + T H differentiation through epigenome regulation. We suggest this may arise through TCA cycle perturbations. However, how eIF5A H ultimately maintains an intact TCA cycle in T cells remains to be determined. It is also unclear if increased acetyl-coA drives the enhanced histone acetylation that we believe leads to chromatin remodeling or whether altered HAT expression and/or activity also contribute. Our understanding of which specific transcripts are eIF5A-dependent in T cells remains unclear.

Wild-type C57BL/6, Great, Rag1 −/− , CD45.1 SJL, and mice expressing Cre recombinase (CD4Cre) under the control of the CD4 promoter, were all purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Dohh flox/flox and Dhps flox/flox were a gift from Stefan Balabanov, Zurich. Odc flox/flox mice were purchased from KOMP repository. All mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen free conditions under protocols approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany, and The St. Jude Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Memphis, USA, in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. Mice used for all experiments were littermates and matched for age and sex (both male and female mice were used). Mice for all strains were typically 6-10 weeks of age. Survival curves in Freiburg and Memphis were plotted using the time post-birth that mice were found with rectal prolapse, at which point mice would be sacrificed.
For in vitro culture, naive CD4 + T cells were isolated by negative selection using a Stem Cell kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stem Cell, Cat: 19765). Unless otherwise stated, naive CD4 + T cells were isolated from spleen and lymph nodes. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 55 μM β-mercaptoethanol in 48 well plates at a seeding concentration of 5x10 5 cells per well. All activations were done with 5 ug/mL anti-CD3, 2 ug/mL anti-CD28, and 100 U/mL IL-2. T H polarizations were performed as follows: T H 0 – 10 ng/mL IL-2, 10 μg/mL anti-IFN-γ, 10 μg/mL anti-IL-4. T H 1 – 4 μg/mL anti-IL-4, 10 ng/mL IL-12, 10 ng/mL IL-2. T H 2 – 4 μg/mL anti-IFN-γ, 10 ng/mL IL-4, 10 ng/mL IL-2. T H 17 – 10 μg/mL anti-IFN-γ, 10 μg/mL anti-IL-4, 5 ng/mL IL-6, 5 ng/mL TGF-β, 10 μg/mL IL-1β. T reg – 4 μg/ mL anti-IFN-γ, 4 μg/mL anti-IL-4, 10 ng/mL TGF-β, 10 ng/mL IL-2. Cells were analyzed on day 4 of polarization. Other blocking antibodies used were anti-IL-2, anti-IL-5 (both BioXcell) and anti-IL-13 (Invivogen). For the 13 C arginine tracing under different cytokine conditions in Figures 1 J and S1 C, cytokines and blocking antibodies were used at the following concentrations IL-2 (10 ng/mL), IL-4 (10 ng/mL), IL-12 (10 ng/mL), IL-6 (10 ng/mL), TGF-β (5 ng/mL), IL-1β (10 μg/mL), IL-23 (20 ng/mL, Biolegend), anti-IL-4 (10 μg/mL), and anti-IFN-γ (10 μg/mL). For the cytokine blocking experiments in( Figures S1 I and S3 D, antibodies were used at the following concentrations: anti-IL-2, anti-IL-4, anti-IL-5, anti-IFN-γ (low = 10 μg/mL, medium = 20 μg/mL, high = 50 μg/mL) and anti-IL-13 (low = 1 μg/mL, medium = 2 μg/mL, high = 5 μg/mL). All cytokines were from Peprotech and all blocking antibodies were from BioXcell, unless otherwise stated. The following drug treatments were used 20 μM C646, 250 μM putrescine hydrochloride (all Sigma), 20 μM CPTH2 (Cayman), 30 μM BMS303141 (Tocris).
For western blot analysis, cells were washed with ice cold PBS and lysed in 1 x Cell Signaling lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na 2 EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM β- glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 μg/mL leupeptin (Cell Signaling Technologies), supplemented with 1 mM PMSF. Samples were frozen and thawed 3 times followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Cleared protein lysate was denatured with LDS loading buffer for 10 min at 70°C, and loaded on precast 4% to 12% bis-tris protein gels (Life Technologies). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBLOT 2 system (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Membranes were blocked with 5% w/v milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS and incubated with the appropriate antibodies in 5% w/v BSA in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 overnight at 4°C. All primary antibody incubations were followed by incubation with secondary HRP-conjugated antibody (Pierce) in 5% milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS and visualized using SuperSignal West Pico or femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) on Biomax MR film (Kodak). Antibodies used: anti-ODC, anti-DHPS, anti-DOHH, anti-β-Actin, anti-KAT3B (P300), α-tubulin (Abcam), anti-GAPDH, anti-KAT2A (GCN5), anti-ACLY (Cell Signaling), ant-EIF5A (BD Bioscience), anti-hypusine (Millipore).
With the exception of 13 C putrescine tracing, in which cells were treated with 13 C putrescine for the final 48 hours of culture, tracing of all heavy-labeled substrates was performed by placing cells into fresh culture media containing heavy labeled substrate with fresh cytokines and blocking antibodies for the final 24 hours of culture. All tracing culture media was also supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, with the exception of 13 C putrescine tracing. 13 C-Argining tracing was performed by culturing cells in SILAC media supplemented with 0.2 mM L-lysine and 1.1 mM 13 C-Arginine (Cambridge Isotope Lab.). 13 C glutamine tracing was carried out by culturing cells in glutamine-free RPMI supplemented with 4 mM 13 C glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Lab.). 13 C glucose tracing was carried out in glucose-free RPMI with 11 mM 13 C glucose (Cambridge Isotope Lab.). For 13 C proline tracing, cells were cultured in DMEM (that lacks L-proline) with 0.2 mM 13 C proline (Cambridge Isotope Lab.). 15 N Methionine tracing was performed in methionine-free RPMI supplemented with 0.1 mM 15 N methionine (Sigma). 13 C putrescine (Cambridge Isotope Lab.) tracing took place in RPMI.
For harvest, cells were rinsed with cold PBS and metabolites extracted using a mix of cold methanol, acetonitrile and water (50:30:20) kept on dry ice. For polyamine detection, metabolites were extracted in this same mix but with 1.5% hydrochloric acid. Following mixing and centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and dried via centrifugal evaporation. Dried metabolite extracts were resuspended in pyridine and derivatized with methoxyamine (sc-263468 Santa Cruz Bio) for 60 minutes at 37°C and subsequently with N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamid, with 1% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (375934 Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 80°C. Isotopomer distributions were measured using a DB5-MS GC column in a 7890 GC system (Agilent Technologies) combined with a 5977 MS system (Agilent Technologies). Correction for natural isotope abundance and calculation of fractional contribution was performed as described elsewhere ( Buescher et al., 2015 9. Buescher, J.M. ∙ Antoniewicz, M.R. ∙ Boros, L.G. ... A roadmap for interpreting (13)C metabolite labeling patterns from cells Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2015; 34 :189-201 Crossref Scopus (455) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Metabolites were quantified by LC-MS using HILIC Chromatography on an Acquity UPLC BEH Amide column 1.7 μm, 2.1x100 mm on a 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies) combined with targeted detection in a 6495 MS system (Agilent Technologies). Peak areas were normalized to 13 C labeled internal standard (ISOtopic Solutions). Polyamines were extracted from CD4 + T cells using a mix of cold methanol, acetonitrile and water (50:30:20) containing 1.5% hydrochloric acid.
For tracing of heavy-labeled substrates into polyamines, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and metabolites were extracted using extraction buffer comprising 50:30:20 methanol:acetonitrile:water (plus 2% acid for polyamine extraction) cooled on dry ice for 30 minutes beforehand. Samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 minutes to remove protein debris and supernatants were dried using a Genevac EZ2 speed vac and then stored at −80 until acquisition. Metabolite analysis was carried out using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC in line with a Bruker Impact II QTOF (resolution > 50,000 FSR). Details of LC-MS methods are described by Edwards-Hicks et al. (2020) 16. Edwards-Hicks, J. ∙ Mitterer, M. ∙ Pearce, E.L. ... Metabolic Dynamics of In Vitro CD8+ T Cell Activation Metabolites. 2020; 11 :12 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar . In brief, chromatographic separation of metabolites was performed using a Phenomenex Luna NH2 column (50 × 2 mm, 3 μm particles) using a solvent gradient of 100% buffer B (5 mM ammonium carbonate in 90% acetonitrile) to 90% buffer A (10 mM NH4 in water). The mass spectrometer was operated in negative mode. Chromatographic separation of polyamines was performed using a Waters CSH C18 column (100 × 2 mm, 1.7 μm particles) using a solvent gradient of 100% buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 97% buffer B (50:50 acetonitrile:methanol). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive mode. Data analysis was performed using AssayR software ( Wills et al., 2017 67. Wills, J. ∙ Edwards-Hicks, J. ∙ Finch, A.J. AssayR: A Simple Mass Spectrometry Software Tool for Targeted Metabolic and Stable Isotope Tracer Analyses Anal. Chem. 2017; 89 :9616-9619 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Metabolites were identified by matching accurate mass and retention time to known standards.
Flow cytometric staining was performed as previously described ( Chang et al., 2015 12. Chang, C.H. ∙ Qiu, J. ∙ O’Sullivan, D. ... Metabolic Competition in the Tumor Microenvironment Is a Driver of Cancer Progression Cell. 2015; 162 :1229-1241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2166) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess cytokine staining in vitro and ex vivo , cells were re-stimulated with 50 ng/mL PMA and 1 μg/mL ionomycin in the presence of brefeldin A (Biolegend) for 5 hours. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed using BD CytoFix/CytoPerm kit (BD Biosciences) and nuclear staining of transcription factors using the FoxP3 Permeabilisation kit (eBioscience). Cells were stained with Live/Dead viability dye (Thermo) prior to antibody staining. Cells were collected on LSR II and Fortessa flow cytometers (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar) software. The following antibodies were used: anti-CD4, anti-TCRβ, anti-CD45, anti-IL17A, anti-IL-17B, anti-IFN-γ, anti-T-bet, anti-GATA-3, anti-FoxP3 (all Biolegend), anti-RORγt (BD Bioscience), anti-ODC, anti-spermine synthase (both Abcam). For analysis of chromatin marks, cells were gated on Ki-67 + cells and diploid cells with ‘single’ DNA content based on FxCycle (dapi, Thermo) staining in the live cell gate. Primary antibodies were stained for 90 minutes in permeabilization buffer at room temperature, followed by staining with the relevant secondary antibody for 30 minutes. The following antibodies were used: anti-H3k4Me 3 , anti-H3k9Ac, anti-H3k27Ac, anti-H3k9Me 3 (all Cell Signaling), and anti-H3k36Me 3 (Abcam).
4x10 5 naive CD4 + T cells (CD45Rb hi CD25 - CD44 lo CD62L + ) from WT or Odc -ΔT mice were adoptively transferred into 12 week old Rag1 −/− recipient mice (Jackson) by intravenous injection. For experiments involving the co-transfer of naive CD4 + T cells with or without T regs , we transferred 4x10 5 naive CD4 + T cells (CD45Rb hi CD25 - CD44 lo CD62L + ) from CD45.1 SJL mice with or without 1.5x10 5 T regs (CD4 + CD25 + sorted by FACS post-CD4 + T cell enrichment) from either Dohh -ΔT mice or their WT littermate controls. Disease score was calculated at the experimental endpoint using the following criteria: Score Weight loss Stool Consistency Blood in stool 0 None Normal Negative 1 1-5% Soft but still formed Negative 2 6-10% Soft Blood traces in stool visible 3 11-18% Very soft; wet Blood traces in stool visible 4 > 18% Watery diarrhea Gross rectal bleeding Open table in a new tab
Mice were injected intraperitoneally with CD3-specific antibody (clone 2C11, BioXcell, 50 μg/mouse) three times with 48 hours between each injection. Mice were sacrificed for analysis 4 hours after the third injection.
Serum and supernatent cytokine were measured by cytokine bead array using the LEGENDPlex Th cytokine panel according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Biolegend) on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
For lung, mice were perfused with PBS through the left ventricle. Organs were cut up into 1-3 mm 3 pieces and digested in 1 ug/mL Collagenase A (Sigma) and 0.5 mg/mL Dnase I (Roche) in RPMI at 37°C for 30 minutes on a shaker. Digested organs were then mechanically disrupted through a cell strainer prior to flow cytometry staining. Cell suspensions from the colonic lamina propria were prepared as follows: briefly, colons were isolated, cleaned, cut into small pieces and placed in RPMI/5% FCS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA. Tubes were then placed in 37°C in a shaking incubator to remove intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). This washing process was repeated twice, followed by one incubation with RPMI/5% FCS containing 15 mM HEPES. Digestion of the colon tissue was performed in RPMI/0.5% FCS containing 1 mg/ml type VIII collagenase (Sigma Aldrich) and 40 μg/ml DNase I (Roche) at 37°C for 60 minutes on a shaker. Supernatants were then filtered and a three-layered discontinuous Percoll gradient was used to obtain an enriched leukocyte fraction.
For the isolation of cells from the small intestine lamina propria – small intestines were isolated, cleaned and cut into 2cm pieces. Tissue was then incubated for 25 minutes in RPMI/3% FCS supplemented with 5mM EDTA and 0.15 mg/ml DTT at 37°C with shaking. After, small intestines were washed 3 times with RPMI containing 2mM EDTA. Tissue was then digested for 30 minutes in RPMI containing 0.1mg/ml Liberase TL (Roche) and 50ug/ml DNase I (Roche) at 37°C with shaking. After that a three-layered discontinuous Percoll gradient was used to enriched for the leukocyte fraction.
Samples of the colon and caecum were collected and fixed in buffered 10% of 36% formalin solution for 24 hours and then stored in 70% ethanol prior to processing. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on 4–5 mm paraffin-embedded sections.
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer instructions and quantified using Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq stranded mRNA kit (Illumina) and sequenced in a HISeq 3000 (Illumina) by the Deep-sequencing Facility at the Max-Planck-Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics. Sequenced libraries were processed with deepTools ( Ramírez et al., 2016 54.

Raw mapped reads were processed in R (Lucent Technologies) with DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 40. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate normalized read counts to visualize as heatmaps using Morpheus (Broad Institute) and determine differentially expressed genes with greater than 2 fold change and lower than 0.05 adjusted p value. Gene ontology analysis was performed used the free online platform DAVID ( Huang et al., 2009 30. Huang, W. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Lempicki, R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :44-57 Crossref Scopus (27965) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Ingenuity® pathway Analysis (QIAGEN). Supervised clustering of gene expression was performed with pheatmap (version2012) using Ward’s minimum variance method ( Murtagh and Legendre, 2014 43. Murtagh, F. ∙ Legendre, P.

Briefly, 5x10 4 T cells treated as described were washed in PBS and then lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 and 0.1% Igepal CA-630 (all Sigma). Nuclei were then spun down and then resuspend in 25 μL TD (2x reaction buffer), 2.5 μL TDE1 (Nextera Tn5 Transposase) and 22.5 μL nuclease-free water, incubated for 30 min at 37°C. DNA was purified with the QIAGEN MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR amplification was performed with the NEBNext High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (New England Labs) using custom Nextera PCR Primers containing barcodes. Adaptors were removed with AMPure XP beads according to manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were quantified with the Qubit and submitted for sequencing with a HISeq 3000 (Illumina) by the staff at the Deep-sequencing Facility at the Max-Planck-Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics. Sequenced samples were trimmed with Trimmomatic 9 and mapped using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 35. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ). Open chromatin was detected with MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 72. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (10883) PubMed Google Scholar ), while differences between treatments was determined using DiffBind ( Ross-Innes et al., 2012 57. Ross-Innes, C.S. ∙ Stark, R. ∙ Teschendorff, A.E. ... Differential oestrogen receptor binding is associated with clinical outcome in breast cancer Nature. 2012; 481 :389-393 Crossref Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ) with at least 2 fold change in accessibility and a false discovery rate lower than 0.05. For visualization only, replicate mapped files were merged with SAM tools 13 and coverage files were generated with deepTools and visualized alongside coverage files on IGV ( Robinson et al., 2011 56. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Winckler, W. ... Integrative genomics viewer Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :24-26 Crossref Scopus (9419) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bed files were analyzed with Bedtools 15 .
All guide RNAs were purchased from IDT. Duplexes of two separate guides per target gene were prepared by annealing (5 min; 98°C) equimolar concentrations of CRISPR gRNA and trRNA, then incubation (20 min; RT) with Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (IDT). For the delivery of RNP complexes, naive CD4 + T cells were washed in PBS, mixed with the RNP complexes and Electroporation Enhancer in P4 Primary Cell buffer (Lonza) immediately prior to electroporation (4D-Nucleofector; Lonza – Program DS137). Per electroporation, 60 pmol of Cas9 Nuclease and 180 pmol of annealed gRNAs were used. Electroporated cells were recovered in T cell medium for 2 hours prior to activation with αCD3/CD28 and pertinent polarizing cytokines. The following guides were used: Mm.Cas9.Tbx21.1AC and Mm.Cas9.Tbx21.1AD (T-Bet); Mm.Cas9.EP300.1AC and Mm.Cas9.EP300.1AE (P300); Mm.Cas9.KAT2A.1AA and Mm.Cas9.KAT2A.1AD (KAT2A); Mm.Cas9.ACLY.1AE and Mm.Cas9.ACLY.1AF (ACLY); Mm.Cas9.GCGAGGTATTCGGCTCCGCG (Non-specific control guide).
p values were determined using unpaired Student’s t test unless otherwise stated. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05 ( ∗ < p0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001). Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6 software.
