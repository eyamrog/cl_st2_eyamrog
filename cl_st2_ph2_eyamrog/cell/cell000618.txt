Title: Protective prototype-Beta and Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer vaccines against SARS-CoV-2


Abstract: Summary

Breakthrough infections by SARS-CoV-2 variants become the global challenge for pandemic control. Previously, we developed the protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 based on the dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of prototype SARS-CoV-2. Here, we developed a chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine approach to adapt SARS-CoV-2 variants. A prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer was first designed to adapt the resistant Beta variant. Compared with its homotypic forms, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of variants and conferred better protection in mice. The protection of the chimeric vaccine was further verified in macaques. This approach was generalized to develop Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer to adapt the currently prevalent variants. Again, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants and conferred better protection against challenge by either Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The chimeric approach is applicable for rapid updating of immunogens, and our data supported the use of variant-adapted multivalent vaccine against circulating and emerging variants.

Section: Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants are continually emerging, and they become the circulating strains in the world ( www.who.int ). Several highly transmissible variants of concern (VOCs) showed altered pathogenicity and transmission ( Karim and Karim, 2021 19. Karim, S.S.A. ∙ Karim, Q.A.

The immune escape of the variants to the current approved vaccines and, concomitantly, the breakthrough infections have become the global challenge to end the pandemic ( Liu et al., 2021a 26.

Currently, all approved vaccines are based on prototype SARS-CoV-2. Given the circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 are fast changing, it is debated yet in the field that what our vaccine strategy is going forward? Should it be the prototype boosting, or using variant-specific vaccine, or using multivalent vaccine with broader coverage of both circulating and emerging variants?

ZF2001 is rolling out in the vaccination campaign with more than 250 million doses administrated globally.

The recent occurring Omicron variant showed more severe immune escape than the Beta variant ( Cameroni et al., 2022 1. Abdool Karim, S.S. ∙ de Oliveira, T.

Med. 2022; 28 :490-495 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ), and accordingly, the neutralizing activities of ZF2001-elicited human sera were 3.1- to 10.6-fold lower against recently circulating Omicron variant than prototype ( Zhao et al., 2022 61. Zhao, X. ∙ Li, D. ∙ Ruan, W. ... Effects of a prolonged booster interval on neutralization of Omicron variant N. Engl. J. Med. 2022; 386 :894-896 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the positive correlation between neutralizing titer and protection efficacy ( Khoury et al., 2021 20. Khoury, D.S. ∙ Cromer, D. ∙ Reynaldi, A. ... Neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of immune protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1205-1211 Crossref Scopus (2459) PubMed Google Scholar ), the sera neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants is believed to impact vaccine effectiveness.
When the Beta emerged as the most resistant VOC in early 2021, we first generated prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimers to cover both prototype and Beta linages. The antigenic characterization and structural analysis of RBD-dimer immunogens were performed to validate the major epitopes displayed. The neutralizing activities of vaccine-elicited mice sera against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants were further tested. The protection efficacy was evaluated in mice. Given the outperformance of the prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer in comparison with its homotypic counterparts, we produced the prototype-Beta chimeric antigen in pilot scale for preclinical efficacy study in rhesus macaques. Vaccine-elicited humoral and cellular immune responses were tested, and subsequently, the protective efficacies against challenge from prototype, Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2, were further evaluated. Over the next few months, Delta and Omicron became the major circulating variants one after another. Vaccines inducing broader immune responses, with particularly high activity against both Delta and Omicron variants, are urgently needed. Therefore, using the chimeric approach, we rapidly developed the Delta-Omicron RBD-dimer vaccine. The antigenic integrity and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure were determined; the immunogenicity and protective efficacy were further evaluated, demonstrating the advantage and generalizability of the chimeric vaccine approach in countermeasure of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This is a proof of concept for rapid updating of immunogens based on the chimeric approach, and our data supported the WHO’s advice to develop multivalent and variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines ensuring the breadth of the immune response against circulating and emerging variants ( WHO, 2022 53.

Section: Results

The chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine design strategy was first tested in the surge of Beta variant in early 2021. The RBD of Beta variant has three mutations: K417N, E484K, and N501Y ( Figure S1 A). To adapt Beta variant, we designed two immunogens based on the original prototype RBD-dimer: (1) two copies of Beta RBD and (2) the C-terminal prototype RBD linked N-terminal Beta RBD as a prototype-Beta chimera ( Figure 1 A). These immunogens were expressed in Expi293F cells and purified as single dimer-sized proteins (molecular weight ∼60 kDa) as verified by analytical gel filtration and gel electrophoresis ( Figures S1 B–S1D). Next, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay was performed to verify the exposure of both receptor-binding motif (RBM) and major antigenic sites, using receptor protein of human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) ( Wang et al., 2020 50. Wang, Q. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Wu, L. ... Structural and functional basis of SARS-CoV-2 entry by using human ACE2 Cell. 2020; 181 :894-904.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2068) PubMed Google Scholar ) and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs as probes. Representative mAbs target five major antigenic sites with available structures ( Figure 1 B; Barnes et al., 2020 5. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ...

A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Science. 2020; 368 :630-633 Crossref Scopus (1030) PubMed Google Scholar ). Monomeric prototype and Beta RBD proteins were tested for comparison. As expected, all these immunogens showed similar binding affinities to hACE2 (apparent K D ranging from 1.13 to 2.66 nM) ( Figures 1 D and S2 A). Compared with the prototype RBD, both monomeric and dimeric forms of Beta RBD showed dramatically decreased binding affinities to mAb CB6 (no detectable binding), CV07-270 (>100-fold reduction), and C110 (>100-fold reduction), respectively, demonstrating the antigenic changes. By contrast, both prototype and prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer preserved the binding activities to almost all tested mAbs ( Figures 1 D and S2 A). This is because in the prototype-Beta chimeric design, the prototype domain can bind well with all these mAbs, including CB6.
For further structural characterization, we determined the cryo-EM structures of fragment antigen binding (Fab) of CB6 in complex with either prototype or prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer. Since the two copies of RBD tethered by the flexibly N and C termini, both the homotypic and chimeric RBD-dimers showed a variety of conformations, precluding the structure analysis at high resolution ( Figures S3 A–S3F). After image reconstruction by two-dimensional (2D) classification and 3D refinement, the prototype and prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimers bound to CB6 Fabs were determined to 11.5- and 11.6-Å resolution of mass density maps, respectively, into which the previously published atomic models of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RBD/CB6 complex were fitted and rebuilt ( Figures S3 A–S3F). The rebuilt models showed their overall conformations. Like MERS-CoV RBD-dimer structure as we reported earlier (PDB: 7C02) ( Dai et al., 2020 13. Dai, L. ∙ Zheng, T. ∙ Xu, K. ... A universal design of Betacoronavirus vaccines against COVID-19, MERS, and SARS Cell. 2020; 182 :722-733.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ), both prototype and prototype-Beta chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD-dimers arranged as “bilateral lung”-like structures with axial symmetry ( Figures 1 E, 1F, S4 D, and S4E). Two RBD subunits stack together via core domains of each other with their external domains exposed. As expected, prototype RBD-dimer is in complexed with dual CB6 Fabs at both arms ( Figure 1 E). By contrast, prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer only engages one CB6 Fab at one arm, which is consistent with the fact that Beta RBD with K417N mutation is resistant to CB6 binding ( Figure 1 F; Starr et al., 2021 43.

In summary, the antigenic characterization and structural analysis demonstrated that the recombinant RBD-dimers correctly presented RBM and major neutralizing epitopes.
To assess the vaccine immunogenicity, groups of BALB/c mice (two batches pooled together) were administrated with two doses of 0.5 μg prototype, Beta or prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer, adjuvanted with AddaVax (a squalene-based adjuvant), 21 days apart. PBS plus adjuvant was given as sham control. Mouse serum samples were collected 14 days after the second dose. We used a panel of pseudotyped viruses (vesicular stomatitis virus backbone) displaying SARS-CoV-2 spikes to test the sera neutralizing activities against variants, including the prototype (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain), all five VOCs (Alpha [B.1.1.7], Beta [B.1.351], Gamma [P.1], Delta [B.1.617.2], Delta plus [B.1.617.2 with an additional K417N substitution in spike], and Omicron [B.1.1.529]) and two variants of interest (VOIs) (Kappa [B.1.617.1] and Lambda [C.37]) ( Figure S1 A). Two doses of prototype vaccine elicited high levels of NAbs against pseudovirus displaying prototype spike, with geometric mean titer (GMT) of 50% pseudovirus neutralization titer (pVNT 50 ) up to 1,779 ( Figures 2 A and S5 A). The pVNT 50 GMT exhibited varying reductions against pseudovirus displaying variant spikes ( Figures 2 A and S5 A). Antisera showed slight decline in neutralization of pseudovirus displaying Alpha spike (GMT, 1,479) but exhibited more pronounced reductions in neutralization of pseudoviruses displaying Beta (GMT, 487), Gamma (GMT, 699), Delta (GMT, 1,100), Delta plus (GMT, 1,119), Kappa (GMT, 1,205), Lambda (GMT, 807), and Omicron (GMT, 122) spikes ( Figure 2 A). Omicron variant contains the most mutations in RBD (15 sites) ( Figure S1 A) and is the most resistant to sera neutralization (14.6-fold reduction). Beta and Gamma variants, containing similar three mutations at RBD (K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y) ( Figure S1 A), were the other two with large (2.5- to 3.7-fold) reductions. On the contrary, Beta RBD-dimer vaccine induced enhanced neutralizing responses against pseudotyped viruses displaying Beta and Gamma spikes (GMT 809 and 1,650, respectively) ( Figure 2 A) but largely reduced responses against prototype and other variant pseudoviruses (GMTs ranging from 104 to 385) ( Figure 2 A). Encouragingly, prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine elicited balanced antibody responses to neutralize Omicron (GMT 434) and all other pseudotyped viruses tested (GMTs ranging from 1,140 to 2,964). It outperformed prototype vaccine to elicit neutralizing responses against Beta, Gamma, and Omicron pseudotyped viruses ( Figure 2 A) and was also superior to the Beta vaccine to elicit antisera in neutralization of pseudotyped virus displaying prototype, Alpha, Delta, Delta plus, Kappa, Lambda, or Omicron spikes ( Figure 2 A). More intuitionally, the radar plot showed that prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine induced the broadest and most balanced neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, compared with homotypic RBD-dimer vaccines ( Figure 2 B).
To further explore the protective efficacy of these RBD-dimers, the first batch of eight mice in each group were evaluated for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. BALB/c mouse is not sensitive to prototypic SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the low binding affinity between mouse ACE2 and S protein but becomes sensitive to Beta variant due to the promoted affinity by N501Y mutation at S protein ( Niu et al., 2021 32. Niu, Z. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Gao, X. ... N501Y mutation imparts cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to mice by enhancing receptor binding Signal Transduct. Target Ther. 2021; 6 :284 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, four mice in each group were transduced via intranasal (i.n.) route with adenovirus (Ad5) expressing hACE2 and, 5 days later, challenged intranasally with prototypic SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/China/CAS-B001/2020 strain). The other four mice in each group were challenged directly with Beta SARS-CoV-2 variant (GDPCC-nCoV84 strain) ( Meng et al., 2021 31. Meng, J. ∙ Mei, S. ∙ Chen, L. ... A case of new variant COVID-19 first emerging in South Africa detected in a security guard at the isolation point—Shenzhen, China, January 23, 2021 China CDC Wkly. 2021; 3 :218-220 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) via i.n. route. Mice were euthanized and necropsied at 5 days postinfection (DPI) to quantify viral genomic (g)RNA and subgenomic (sg)RNA, an indicator of viral replication ( Wölfel et al., 2020 31. Meng, J. ∙ Mei, S. ∙ Chen, L. ... A case of new variant COVID-19 first emerging in South Africa detected in a security guard at the isolation point—Shenzhen, China, January 23, 2021 China CDC Wkly. 2021; 3 :218-220 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ), in lung. For mice challenged with prototype SARS-CoV-2, high levels of both viral gRNA (average: 1.72 × 10 9 copies/g) and sgRNA (average: 1.9 × 10 8 copies/g) were detected in sham-immunized mice ( Figures 2 C and 2D). By contrast, significantly reduced viral loads (p < 0.0001) were detected in vaccine-immunized mice. Averages of pulmonary viral gRNA were 4.61 × 10 5 , 2.58 × 10 6 , and 2.66 × 10 5 copies/g in prototype, Beta and prototype-Beta chimeric vaccine groups, respectively, with 2–4-log 10 reduction compared with the sham group ( Figure 2 C). In line with the trends in neutralization, both prototype and prototype-Beta chimeric vaccine groups showed significantly lower viral gRNA compared with the Beta vaccine group (p = 0.016 and 0.0045, respectively) ( Figure 2 C). All vaccine groups showed undetectable pulmonary viral sgRNA, indicating the complete control of viral replication ( Figure 2 D). Analysis of immune correlates of protection following vaccination showed that NAb titers correlated strongly with the reduction of pulmonary prototypic SARS-CoV-2 gRNA based on a linear model (r = −0.8967, p < 0.0001) ( Figure 2 E).
For mice challenged with SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant, high levels of pulmonary viral gRNA (average: 4.01 × 10 8 copies/g) and sgRNA (average: 3.03 × 10 7 copies/g) were detected in sham-vaccinated mice ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Less than 2-log 10 viral reductions were observed in the prototype vaccine group (average gRNA: 6.34 × 10 6 copies/g; average sgRNA: 4.51 × 10 5 copies/g) ( Figures 2 F and 2G). In contrast, more significant reduction (2–4-log 10 ) of pulmonary viral gRNA was detected in mice vaccinated with Beta (average: 5.46 × 10 5 copies/g; p = 0.0079 compared with the prototype vaccine group) or prototype-Beta chimeric vaccine (average: 9.81 × 10 4 copies/g; p = 0.0001 compared with the prototype vaccine group) ( Figure 2 F). No sgRNA can be detected in both groups, suggesting the completely control of viral replication ( Figure 2 G). In the context of Beta SARS-CoV-2 challenge, NAb titers and pulmonary viral gRNA were also inversely correlated with one another according to a linear model (r = −0.8039, p = 0.0002) ( Figure 2 H).
To provide a further assessment of protection following vaccination, mice in each group were assessed for virus-related pathology in lung at 5 DPI. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to examine histopathology. Sham recipients challenged with either prototype virus or Beta variant showed moderate-to-severe histopathological changes in lung, including vanishment of alveolar cavities, pulmonary vascular congestion, and diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration ( Figure S6 A). In contrast, mice vaccinated with prototype, Beta or prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine exhibited relieved lung injury ( Figure S6 A). Moreover, histopathology showed that both Beta and prototype-Beta chimeric vaccines provided better protection compared with prototype vaccine when mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant ( Figure S6 A). The histopathology result was consistent with the tendency of pulmonary viral gRNA shown above and demonstrated the more balanced protection conferred by prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine.
We next selected the prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer immunogen for further preclinical study. Pilot scale immunogen protein was produced in clinical-grade CHO cell line and formulated with alum-based adjuvant as vaccine. Alum-only buffer was produced as the sham control.
Twenty-four healthy young rhesus macaques ( Table S1 ) were immunized intramuscularly with three jabs of 25 μg vaccine (n = 12), a dose used in human ( Yang et al., 2021 58. Yang, S. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Dai, L. ...

Dis. 2021; 21 :1107-1119 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ), or sham (n = 12), 21 days apart. Serum samples were collected before (day 0) and after (days 14, 35, and 52) priming ( Figure S5 B). The average endpoint titers of RBD-binding antibody raised from 512 after one dose to 46,341 after two doses and further up to 73,562 after three doses in the vaccine group ( Figure 3 A). The sera after three doses were tested for neutralization of pseudotyped viruses expressing four VOCs ( Figures 3 B and S5 C). Sera from vaccinated animals showed robust and balanced neutralizing activities against prototype, Alpha, Beta, and Delta pseudoviruses (GMT ranging between 2,607 and 3,200). All vaccine-elicited sera neutralized Omicron pseudovirus (GMT 496), with a 6.5-fold reduction of titer compared with prototype neutralization ( Figure 3 B). All vaccine-elicited sera neutralized authentic prototype SARS-CoV-2 (GMT 837), variant Alpha (GMT 583), Beta (GMT 393), and Delta (GMT 295) ( Figure 3 C). As the authentic Omicron variant (BA.1 subvariant, National Pathogen Resource Center of China (NPRC): 2.192100005 strain) was available in Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) currently, macaque sera were tested for neutralization of Omicron and showed 1.6-fold reduction of activity against Omicron than against prototype SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3 D). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at day 6 after the third dose were tested for cytokine production using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. In consistent with trends of prototype RBD-dimer vaccine ZF2001 in rhesus macaque and human ( An et al., 2022 3. An, Y. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Jin, X. ...

The 12 rhesus macaques receiving prototype-Beta chimeric vaccine were challenged (n = 4) with prototype SARS-CoV-2 (GDPCC-nCoV27 strain), Beta variant (GDPCC-nCoV84 strain), and Delta (CCPM-B-V-049-2105-8), respectively, via both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The other 12 sham-immunized animals were also challenged in parallel as controls (n = 4) ( Figure S5 B). Body weight and temperature were monitored daily until euthanasia at 7 DPI ( Figure S5 D). Swabs were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 DPI from nose, throat, and anus for viral gRNA quantification. At 7 DPI, lung tissues were collected from 7 lopes for histopathology examination. Lung tissues from each lope (a sample mixture of six sites) were quantified for viral gRNA.
Viral loads (gRNA) were detected in many lung lopes of control animals, with the average 1.66-log 10 copies per gram in prototype challenge group, 2.93-log 10 in Beta challenge group, and 6.95-log 10 in Delta challenge group ( Figures 4 A, 4D, and 4G). In contrast, significantly lower viral loads were detected in vaccinated animals, with only 1 and 3 lopes having detectable viral gRNA in prototype and Beta challenge group, respectively ( Figures 4 A and 4D). In comparison to sham-immunized macaques, lower viral loads were also detected in both upper respiratory tract (nasal and throat swabs) and anus (anal swab) of the vaccinated animals in all days after infections with prototype or Beta SARS-CoV-2 ( Figures 4 J–4L). However, the vaccine protection against Delta viral gRNA in upper airway is less pronounced ( Figures 4 J and 4K).
At 7 days post inoculation of prototype, Beta or Delta SARS-CoV-2, all sham-immunized macaques developed moderate-to-severe pneumonia, with thickened alveolar septa, vanishment of pulmonary alveolar, congestion, and massive inflammatory cell infiltration in alveoli ( Figures 4 B, 4C, 4E, 4F, 4H, and 4I). In contrast, none of vaccinated animals developed severe pneumonia, with the pathological scores significantly lower than that of the sham group ( Figures 4 B, 4C, 4E, 4F, 4H, and 4I). Histopathology examination demonstrated that prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine can dramatically relieve the lung injury by either infection of prototype, Beta or Delta SARS-CoV-2.
In the late 2021, Omicron variant were circulating globally and gradually substituted its predecessor Delta ( Karim and Karim, 2021 19. Karim, S.S.A. ∙ Karim, Q.A. Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant: a new chapter in the COVID-19 pandemic Lancet. 2021; 398 :2126-2128 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mutations in the spike protein of Omicron variant lead to the resistance for humoral immune responses induced by early SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination (Cameroni et al., 2022; Dejnirattisai et al., 2022 14. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Huo, J. ∙ Zhou, D. ...

The Omicron variant is highly resistant against antibody-mediated neutralization: implications for control of the COVID-19 pandemic Cell. 2022; 185 :447-456.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the context of cocirculation of Delta and Omicron variants, we developed the Delta-Omicron vaccine with our chimeric RBD-dimer approach ( Figure 1 A).
The Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer protein was expressed and purified with high yield and purity, indicating the capacity for large-scale production ( Figure S1 E). Next, the exposure of RBM and major antigenic sites of RBD-dimer vaccine were verified through SPR assay using hACE2 protein and major classes of RBD-specific mAbs as probes ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Monomeric RBD proteins from prototype, Delta, and Omicron variants were used for comparison. Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer showed similar binding affinity (8.44 nM) to hACE2 in comparison with the affinities of monomeric prototype (6.53 nM), Delta (5.09 nM), and Omicron RBD (6.59 nM) ( Figures 1 D and S2 B). For the mAb binding, the Delta RBD did not bind to mAb C110 and exhibited decreased binding affinity to mAb CV07-270; the Omicron RBD did not bind to mAb CB6 and displayed reduced binding affinities to mAbs CV07-270 and C110 ( Figures 1 D and S2 B). In contrast, Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer bound all the tested representative mAbs, but like a combination of Delta and Omicron RBD with the decreased affinities to mAbs CV07-270 and C110, respectively ( Figures 1 D and S2 B).
The cryo-EM structure of Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer in complexed with CB6 Fab was determined at resolution of 12.8 Å. It reassembles the structure of prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer in complexed with CB6 Fab as the “bilateral lung”-like structure engaging one CB6 Fab at the Delta arm ( Figures 1 G, S4 A–S4C, and S4F). In summary, the antigenic characterization and structural analysis indicated that the Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer protein was correctly folded, presenting the RBM and major antigenic epitopes.
To evaluate the immunogenicity of Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine, BALB/c mice were immunized with two doses of AddaVax adjuvanted Delta-Omicron chimeric protein or homotypic prototype RBD-dimer protein, 21 days apart. Delta-Omicron vaccine elicited high titers of serological NAbs against pseudotyped virus displaying Delta, Omicron (BA.1), and Omicron (BA.2) spike proteins, respectively, with 18.6, 19.2, and 19.1 times of those induced by homotypic prototype RBD-dimer vaccine ( Figure 5 A). Meanwhile, the GMTs of neutralizing activities against prototype, Alpha, and Beta SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus were all higher in the Delta-Omicron vaccine group in comparison with the homotypic prototype vaccine group, demonstrating the outperformance of Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine to induce broader immune responses ( Figures 5 A and 5B).
To evaluate the protection efficacy of Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine, the immunized BALB/c mice (n = 10) were randomly divided into two batches (n = 5) and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 Delta (CCPM-B-V-049-2105-8 strain) and Omicron (BA.1 subvariant, CCPM-B-V-049-2112-18 strain) variants, respectively. Since wild-type BALB/c mice were sensitive to Omicron variant but not Delta variant, the mice for Delta variant challenge were transduced with Ad5 expressing hACE2 5 days before virus inoculation. At 3 DPI, all mice were euthanized and necropsied, and lung samples were collected for virus titration.
For mice challenged with Delta variant, the averages of pulmonary viral gRNA were 1.09 × 10 10 in the sham group but reduced to 1.43 × 10 8 copies/g in the prototype vaccine group, and additionally reduced (474-fold) to 2.37 × 10 7 copies/g in the Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine group ( Figure 5 C). In line with this, the pulmonary viral sgRNA were detected in all mice in the sham group with high levels (average: 1.70 × 10 8 copies/g), but only detectable in three mice receiving prototype vaccine with the average titer of 1.07 × 10 6 copies/g and undetectable in the all mice receiving Delta-Omicron vaccine, suggesting the complete control of Delta viral replication ( Figure 5 D).
For mice challenged with Omicron variant, the sham group of mice developed high levels of pulmonary viral gRNA (average: 1.04 × 10 9 copies/g) and sgRNA (average: 1.73 × 10 7 copies/g) ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Mice immunized prototype vaccine showed decreased pulmonary viral gRNA (average: 3.68 × 10 7 copies/g) and sgRNA (2.41 × 10 4 copies/g) ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Encouragingly, the protection efficacy of Delta-Omicron vaccine was better than prototype vaccine, with no pulmonary virus replication detected in all mice ( Figure 5 H). NAb titers inversely correlated with the reduction of pulmonary gRNA of both Delta variant (r = −0.8889, p < 0.0001) and Omicron variant (r = −0.7362, p < 0.0017) based on a linear model ( Figures 5 E and 5I).
The histopathological analysis showed that at 3 days post either Delta or Omicron variant infection, sham-immunized mice developed pulmonary damage, including inflammatory cell infiltration, congestion, and vanishment of alveolar cavities ( Figure S6 B). As a comparison, both prototype and Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine-immunized mice showed alleviative lung injury, with the pathological scores significantly lower than those of the sham group ( Figures 5 F and 5J). Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine showed lower pathological scores in comparison with the homotypic prototype form, indicating a better protection ( Figures 5 G, 5H, and 5J).

Section: Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 variants have caused waves of new infections worldwide, including the recent Omicron outbreak. To fight against the SARS-CoV-2 variants, we developed a chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine approach, which induced broader immune responses than homotypic RBD-dimer vaccines. Based on this approach, we firstly designed the prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine and then the Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine.
In the first half of 2021, Beta variant was highly concerned because of its greatly decreased sensitivity to vaccine-elicited sera and its reduction of vaccine efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in the real world ( Abu-Raddad et al., 2021 2.

Therefore, we present a chimeric vaccine design using RBD-dimer to cover both prototype and Beta variants. The prototype-Beta vaccine induced broader NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 variants than its antigenically homotypic counterparts, especially, with higher activities to cross-neutralize the recently circulating Omicron variant pseudotyped virus ( Figure 2 A). Accordingly, prototype-Beta chimeric version showed better protection against SARS-CoV-2, compared with both homotypic prototype and Beta vaccines. The nonhuman primates study showed that high viral loads of Delta SARS-CoV-2 were detected in both upper respiratory tract and lung of all macaques. Our data supported the finding that Delta variant caused frequent breakthrough infections in the real world ( Levine-Tiefenbrun et al., 2021 24. Levine-Tiefenbrun, M. ∙ Yelin, I. ∙ Alapi, H. ...

Dis. 2022; 22 :183-195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although Delta variant was more difficult to be cleared in the upper airway, prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine significantly decreased viral loads of 3.4-log 10 in lung and prevented virus-induced lung lesion ( Figures 4 G–4I).
In the second half of 2021, Delta and Omicron VOCs emerged one after another and became the circulating variants successively. The Omicron variant carries mutations at as many as 32 positions in the S protein, including 15 positions in the RBD, and has showed strongly reduced sensitivity to the approved vaccine-elicited sera ( Cameroni et al., 2022 6.

Med. 2022; 28 :490-495 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the present study, we also observed that pseudotyped virus displaying Omicron spike was the most resistant to prototype vaccine-elicited antisera (14.6-fold reduction in neutralization) ( Figure 2 A). However, the sera elicited by prototype-Beta vaccine showed 3.6-fold higher than that induced by homotypic prototype vaccine ( Figure 2 A). Recently, in the context of the global cocirculation of Delta and Omicron variants, we rapidly developed the Delta-Omicron vaccine with our chimeric RBD-dimer approach. The Delta-Omicron vaccine outcompeted the homotypic prototype vaccine to prevent infections by either Delta or Omicron variants in mice and was also balanced to counter prototype and the other VOCs. Interestingly, recent studies showed the Omicron-specific mRNA vaccine induced mice sera that potently neutralized Omicron variant but showed limited neutralization of historical D614G or other SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as Beta and Delta variants ( Lee et al., 2022 23.

Boosting with Omicron-matched or historical mRNA vaccines increases neutralizing antibody responses and protection against B.1.1.529 infection in mice Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Consistently, WHO advised to develop multivalent vaccines as next generation of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for induction of broader immune responses against both circulating and emerging variants ( WHO, 2022 53. WHO Interim Statement on COVID-19 vaccines in the context of the circulation of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Variant from the WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) https://www.who.int/news/item/11-01-2022-interim-statement-on-covid-2019-vaccines-in-the-context-of-the-circulation-of-the-omicron-sars-cov-2022-variant-from-the-who-technical-advisory-group-on-covid-2019-vaccine-composition Date: 2022 Google Scholar ). Our result supported the variant-adapted multivalent vaccines are superior to homotypic prototype or variant-specific vaccine in the context of the fast-changing variant circulation.
Previous studies described the use of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 RBD scaffolded immunogens to induce robust NAbs against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and, concomitantly, enhance the broadly reactive NAbs against VOCs in monkeys; however, the neutralizing titers elicited against VOCs declined when compared with that against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 4.

Saunders, K.O. ∙ Lee, E. ∙ Parks, R. ... Neutralizing antibody vaccine for pandemic and pre-emergent coronaviruses Nature. 2021; 594 :553-559 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, we used an alternative approach, heterotypic RBD-dimer connected in tandem, to induce broad and balanced neutralizing responses against both ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variants. In view of the approval of homotypic RBD-dimer-based vaccine ZF2001 and the high efficacy of this vaccine in Phase 3 clinical trials ( Dai et al., 2022 12. Dai, L. ∙ Gao, L. ∙ Tao, L. ... Efficacy and Safety of the RBD-Dimer-Based Covid-19 Vaccine ZF2001 in Adults N. Engl. J. Med. 2022; Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar ), heterotypic RBD-dimer chimera designs would be a feasible approach to rapidly adapt SARS-CoV-2 variants or even other coronaviruses in future.
In the structural analysis of RBD-dimer antigens, both prototype-Beta and Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimers are observed to be arranged as similar “bilateral lung”-like structures, exposing five major antigenic sites. This supports the versatility of the tandem RBD-dimer as the module to adapt different coronaviruses for the induction of broader immune responses. The present study was timely and encouraging for our fight against COVID-19 pandemic, especially for the Omicron rampage. The Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine is under development by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. This design can also be applied in other vaccine platforms, such as mRNA, DNA, and viral vectors.
First, the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of Delta-Omicron chimeric vaccine was not evaluated in the nonhuman primate model because of the limited animal supply at this moment. We are trying to arrange it. Second, the current vaccines used in humans are based on the ancestral prototype strain, and new variant-specific vaccines should be considered for their role as boosters as well as first-time immunizations. Our data demonstrated the variant-adapted multivalent vaccines were superior to the monovalent prototype- or variant-matched vaccine as first-time immunizations. However, it would be important to further explore whether these vaccines also outperform the others as boosters, given more than 10 billion doses of prototype-based COVID-19 vaccines have been administrated globally.

Monomeric prototype SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: YP_009724390), Beta variant (GISAID: EPI_ISL_736940) and Delta variant (GenBank: OK091006.1) RBD contained S protein 319-541. Prototype SARS-CoV-2 RBD-dimer was two RBD (GenBank: YP_009724390, S protein residues 319–537) connected as tandem repeat. Beta SARS-CoV-2 RBD-dimer was two RBD (GISAID: EPI_ISL_736940, S protein residues 319–537) connected as tandem repeat. Prototype-Beta chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD-dimer was one prototype RBD (S protein residues 319–537) and one Beta RBD (S protein residues 319–537) connected as tandem repeat. Delta-Omicron chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD-dimer was one Delta RBD (S protein residues 319–537) and one Omicron BA.1 RBD (S protein residues 316–534) connected as tandem repeat.
For each construct, signal peptide sequence of MERS-CoV S protein (S protein residues 1-17) was added to the protein N terminus for protein secretion, and a hexa-His tag was added to the C terminus to facilitate further purification processes. These constructs were codon-optimized for mammalian cell expression and synthesized by GENEWIZ, China. These constructs were cloned into the pCAGGS vector, respectively, and transiently transfected into Expi293F™ cells. After 5 days, the supernatant was collected and soluble protein was purified by Ni affinity chromatography using a HisTrap™ HP 5 mL column (GE Healthcare). The samples were further purified via gel filtration chromatography with HiLoad™ 16/600 Superdex™ 200 pg (GE Healthcare) or Superdex™ 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in a buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl. The eluted peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for protein size and purity.
To explore the preclinical and clinical trials, GMP grade of prototype-Beta chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD-dimer protein was produced in CHO-K1 (SAFC) cell lines and purified by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co.Ltd, China. The prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer was one prototype RBD (S protein residues R319-K537) and one Beta RBD (S protein residues V320-K537) connected as tandem repeat. The R319 was deleted in the RBD-dimer protein to avoid the potential protease cleavage. Signal peptide sequence was added to the N terminus for protein secretion. No tag sequence was added at C terminus.
The human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CV07-270, C110, S309 and CR3022 were transiently expressed in Expi293F™ cells. The cells were transfected with pCAGGS plasmids containing coding sequences for immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain, and collected at days 5. The supernatant was mixed with one volume of buffer PBS, and filtered with a 0.22-μm filter. The mixture was passed through the HiTrap™ Protein A HP column (Cytiva). The bound protein was detached from the column by 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0. The elution was adjusted to neutral pH by adding 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 and further purified by gel filtration. The antibody was finally buffered with PBS, concentrated and stored at −80 °C. To generated the fragment of antibody-binding (Fab), purified CV07-270, C110, S309 and CR3022 antibodies were digested with immobilized papain (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fab fractions were purified by HiTrap™ Protein A HP column (Cytiva). To obtain mAb CB6 Fab, Expi293F™ cells were transfected with pCAGGS plasmids coding CB6 Fab, which was purified from the culture supernatant with HisTrap™ HP 5 mL column and HiLoad™ 16/600 Superdex™ 200 pg column in PBS buffer.
The monomeric Omicron (BA.1) variant RBD (S protein 316–534, GISAID: EPI_ISL_6795848) was purchased from ACROBiosystems, which was expressed from HEK293 cells.
The hACE2 protein (residues 1-740, Genbank: NP_068576) was purchased from Sino Biological Inc., China, which was expressed from HEK293T cells.
SPR binding experiments were carried out using a BIAcore 8000 device (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. The buffers for all proteins used for kinetic analyses were exchanged to PBST (10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ; 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4; 137 mM NaCl; 2.7 mM KCl; 0.005% Tween 20). Purified RBD-dimer and -monomer proteins were immobilized on a CM5 chip with the standard EDC/NHS coupling method at about 1,000 response units (RU). Serial dilutions of Fabs were prepared and used to flow over the chip surface. Data were collected over time. After each cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated via a short treatment using 10 mM NaOH. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (apparent binding affinity, K D ) for each antibody were calculated using BIAcore 8000 analysis software (BIAevaluation v3.0). Each set of equilibrium binding responses was fitted to the 1:1 binding model.
For samples of prototype RBD-dimer bound to CB6 Fab and prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer bound to CB6 Fab, an aliquot of 3.5 μl solution (0.4 mg/ml) was applied to glow-discharged Quantifiol R 1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids and blotted for 1.5 s with a humidity of 95% before being plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher). The frozen grides were loaded onto a Titan Krios cryo-transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) that is equipped with a BioQuantum energy filter (Gatan), operated at 300 kV for data collection. Automatic data collection was performed using Serial-EM software. Movies were recorded with a Gatan K2 direct electron in a super-resolution counting mode at pixel size of 0.68 Å. The exposure was performed with a dose rate of 15 e - /pixel/s and an accumulative dose of ∼60 e - /Å 2 for each movie which was fractionated into 32 sub-frames. The final defocus range of the datasets was approximately-(1.2-3.0) μm.
The drift correction of all stacks were performed with MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 63. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate 2 × binned images. Initial contrast transfer function (CTF) values for each micrograph were calculated with CTFFIND4.1 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 37. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2721) PubMed Google Scholar ). Micrographs with an estimated resolution limit worse than 6.0 Å were discarded in the initial screening. The subsequent image processing and reconstruction were performed using Relion-3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 64. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2803) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 36. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3664) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer/CB6 Fab dataset, 302,365 particles were picked from 2036 micrographs. Then the picked particles were extracted and subjected to two rounds of reference-free 2D classification in Relion. A clean dataset with 162,269 particles from good 2D classes were selected and the initial model was generated by cryoSPARC ab initio. Then the model was used as reference in Relion 3D classification. After the third round of 3D classification without applying symmetry, the predominant class containing a subset of 31,507 good particles. These particles were subjected to 3D refinement, which yielded a reconstruction at 11.6 Å resolution as determined by the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.5 cut-off value.
The prototype RBD-dimer/CB6 Fab dataset was processed similarly. Briefly, a total of 289,269 automatically picked particles were extracted in Relion for the following 2D and 3D classification. Three rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed to remove the heterogeneous particles. A clean dataset with 214,464 particles from good 2D classes was selected and subjected to three rounds of 3D classification without applying symmetry. A single dominant class (26,842 particles) was identified and used to calculate the density map at 11.5 Å resolution by applying a 3D refinement with C2 symmetry.
The Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer/CB6 Fab dataset was processed similarly to those described above. The specific images processing and reconstruction were shown in Figures S4 A–S4C.
Due to the fierce flexibility between two RBDs, we could only obtain low resolution maps as described above. However, we fitted the crystal structure of RBD/CB6 complex (PDB: 7C01 ) or its RBD part into the two density maps using CHIMERA ( Pettersen et al., 2004 33. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera—a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32501) PubMed Google Scholar ), which showed a high degree of matching.
The pseudotyped viruses displaying SARS-CoV-2 spikes express GFP in infected cells. They were prepared as previously described ( Zhao et al., 2021 62. Zhao, X. ∙ Zheng, A. ∙ Li, D. ... Neutralisation of ZF2001-elicited antisera to SARS-CoV-2 variants Lancet Microbe. 2021; 2 :e494 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice sera were 2-fold serially diluted and incubated with pseudotyped virus at 37°C for 1 h. Then the mixture was transferred to pre-plated Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates. After incubation for 15 h, the transducing unit numbers were calculated on a CQ1 confocal image cytometer (Yokogawa). Fifty percent pseudovirus neutralization titer (pVNT 50 ) was determined by fitting nonlinear regression curves using GraphPad Prism and calculating the reciprocal of the serum dilution required for 50% neutralization of infection. pVNT 50 below the limit of detection was determined as half the limit of detection.
Neutralizing antibody activities induced by vaccines in rhesus macaques against prototype, Alpha, Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2 were titrated on basis of inhibition of cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in IMBCAMS. Briefly, equal volume of serially diluted serum and 100 TCID 50 SARS-CoV-2 was mixed and incubated for one hour at 37°C. The mixture of serum and virus was added to Vero E6 cells, followed by incubation at 37°C for 3 days. CPE was recorded for determination of antibody neutralizing titer. Prototype SARS-CoV-2 (GDPCC-nCoV27), Alpha (NPRC: 2.062100002), Beta (GDPCC-nCoV84, NPRC: 2.062100001) and Delta (CCPM-B-V-049-2105-8) variants were used in this study.
Neutralizing antibody activities induced by vaccines in rhesus macaques against Omicron variant were titrated on basis of CPE in China CDC. Titers of serological neutralizing antibodies against prototype and Beta SARS-CoV-2 were also measured for comparison. Briefly, equal volume of serially diluted serum and 100 TCID 50 SARS-CoV-2 was mixed and incubated for one hour at 37°C. The mixture of serum and virus was added to Vero cells, followed by incubation at 37°C for 4 days. CPE was recorded for determination of antibody neutralizing titer. Prototype SARS-CoV-2 (IVDC-QD-11-2P2), Beta (GDPCC-nCoV84, NPRC: 2.062100001) and Omicron (BA.1, NPRC: 2.192100005) variants were used in this study.
Binding properties of sera to SARS-CoV-2 prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer protein were determined by ELISA. 96-well plates (3590; Corning, USA) were coated over-night with 3 μg/ml of prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer protein in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and blocked in 5% skim milk in PBS. Serum samples from macaques were serially diluted and added to each well. The plates were incubated for 2 hours and then washed. The plates were incubated with goat anti-monkey IgG-HRP antibody (Abcam, ab112767), incubated for 1.5 hours and then washed. The plates subsequently developed with 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. Reactions were stopped with 2 M hydrochloric acid, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer, USA). The endpoint titers were defined as the highest reciprocal dilution of serum to give an absorbance greater than 2.5-fold of the background values. Antibody titer below the limit of detection was determined as half the limit of detection.
To evaluate the protection efficacy of vaccine candidates against prototype SARS-CoV-2, BALB/c mice model transduced intranasally with a recombinant adenovirus recombinant adenovirus 5 expressing human ACE2 (Ad5-hACE2) was used. Immunized BALB/c mice were i.n infected with 8 × 10 9 vp of Ad5-hACE2. Five days later, the transduced mice were challenged with 5 × 10 5 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/China/CAS-B001/2020 strain) via the i.n. route. For Beta SARS-CoV-2 challenge experiments, the BALB/c mice were directly infected with 1 × 10 6 TCID 50 of Beta SARS-CoV-2 (GDPCC-nCoV84 strain) through the i.n. route. Five days post challenge, all mice were euthanized and necropsied. Lung tissues were collected and split into two parts for virus titration and pathological examination. All mice experiments with SARS-CoV-2 challenge were conducted under ABSL3 facilities.
Mice lung tissues were weighed and homogenized. SARS-CoV-2-specific quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were performed using a FastKing One Step Probe RT-qPCR kit (Tiangen Biotech, China) on a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Two sets of primers and probes were used to detect a region of the N gene of viral genome ( Chandrashekar et al., 2020 9. Chandrashekar, A. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Martinot, A.J. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against rechallenge in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :812-817 Crossref Scopus (630) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a region of E gene of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) of SARS-CoV-2 ( Wölfel et al., 2020 55. Wölfel, R. ∙ Corman, V.M. ∙ Guggemos, W. ... Virological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019 Nature. 2020; 581 :465-469 Crossref Scopus (4732) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively, with sequences as follows: gRNA-F, GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT; gRNA-R, TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG; gRNA-probe, ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC; sgRNA-F, CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC; sgRNA-R, ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA; sgRNA-probe, ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG.
To perform the histopathology analysis, mice lung tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and then sectioned. Tissue sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for pathological examination, including peribronchiolitis (inflammatory cells, primarily lymphocytes, surrounding a bronchiole), perivasculitis (inflammatory cells, primarily lymphocytes, surrounding a blood vessel), interstitial pneumonitis (increased thickness of alveolar walls associated with inflammatory cells, primarily neutrophils), and alveolitis (inflammatory cells, primarily neutrophils and macrophages, within alveolar spaces).
To evaluate the protection efficacy of vaccine candidates against Delta and Omicron variants, the immunized mice were challenged with 6 × 10 5 TCID 50 of Delta variant (CCPM-B-V-049-2105-8) or Omicron variant (BA.1, CCPM-B-V-049-2112-18) via the i.n. route. For Delta variant challenge experiments, the BALB/c mice were transduced intranasally with 8 × 10 9 vp of Ad5-hACE five days before the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three days post challenge, all mice were euthanized and necropsied, and lung tissues were collected for virus titration and pathological examination. The mice experiments with Delta and Omicron variants challenge were conducted under ABSL3 facilities in IMBCAMS. SARS-CoV-2-specific qRT-PCR assays were performed using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The sequences of primers and probes used in the qRT-PCR assays were same as the above description, except for detecting Omicron variant gRNA with the probe sequence of ACTCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC. Mice lung tissues were stained with H&E for pathological examination.
Twenty-four rhesus monkeys (n = 12) were immunized with clinical-grade prototype-Beta chimeric vaccine (25 μg antigen + Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) and placebo (Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant), respectively. Three doses were administrated at days 0, 21 and 42. These monkeys were bled for humoral immunogenicity evaluation before immunization and 14, 35 and 52 days after receiving the first dose.
To evaluate the cellular immune responses elicited by prototype-Beta chimeric vaccine, PBMCs were collected at day 48 and stimulated with peptide pool consisting of 15–18-mers (overlapping by 11 amino acids) and spanning the RBD of prototype SARS-CoV-2. INF-γ, IL-2 and IL-4 ELISpot assays were performed with ELISpot kits according to the manufacturer’s protocols (MabTech, cat#3421M-4APW-10, cat#3445M-4APW-10 and cat#3410-2APW-10).
At the day 56, 57 and 58, animals of prototype-Beta chimeric vaccine group (2 female and 2 male) and sham group (2 female and 2 male) were intranasally and intratracheally challenged with total 1×10 6 TCID 50 prototype SARS-CoV-2 (GDPCC-nCoV27), Beta variant (GDPCC-nCoV84) or Delta variant (CCPM-B-V-049-2105-8). Animals were anesthetized for monitoring body weight and temperature before and post SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Body temperature was measured via electronic scale. Anal temperature was measured via electronic thermometer.
Before challenge and at the days 1, 3, 5, 7 post infection, nasal, throat, and anal swabs were collected from anesthetized animals into clean tube and lysed with Trizol. RNA was eluted with RNase/DNase-free distill water and stored at -80°C.
At 7 DPI, animals were euthanized and dissected for pathological examination of lung. Tissue samples were collected from the left lung (upper lobe, middle lobe and inferior lobe) and the right lung (upper lobe, middle lobe, inferior lobe and accessory lobe) for viral load and histopathology. Examination was performed with emphasis on the histopathology of lung. For evaluation of viral load, tissue samples were collected from 6 sites of each lung lope. Total about 100 mg of mixed tissue samples was minced Trizol. RNase/DNase-free distilled water was used to elute RNA, which was stored at -80°C.
One-step qRT-PCR was performed to measure viral genomic RNA (gRNA) with primers and probe paired with viral N gene that is recommended by WHO and China CDC. The sequences of primers and probe were same as those used in the prototype SARS-CoV-2 gRNA titration experiments described above. The reaction conditions and preparation of the standard for N gene were performed according to SOP or the manufacture’s protocols.
Lung tissue samples of macaques were collected from seven lobes as described above and fixed in neutral formalin. Sections were stained via H&E for histological examination Double-blind evaluation was made on the basis of the histopathological profile of all collected lobe tissues. The histopathological changes of lung, such as inflammation, structure change and hemorrhage, were graded according to the following scoring system.
Score 0 indicates clear structure of alveolar without inflammatory infiltration. Score 1 indicates mild inflammation, slightly widened alveolar septum and sparse mononuclear cells (monocytes and lymphocyte infiltration). Score 2 indicates severe inflammation, thickening of alveolar wall and increased inflammatory infiltration of interstitial monocytes. Score 3-4 indicates alveolar septum widened significantly, increased infiltration of inflammatory cells. Score 5 indicates extensive exudation and widened septum, smaller alveolar cavity, septal bleeding, and infiltration of alveolar cells. Score >5 indicates a large number of cells infiltrated into the alveolar cavity; the alveolar cavity disappeared; the septum fused, and a transparent membrane was formed on the alveolar wall.
At least 5 fields of each section were randomly chosen for evaluation of histopathological changes according to the scoring system above. Histopathological changes of each lobe of lung from every macaque were graded based on thickening or consolidation of pulmonary septum, bleeding of pulmonary septum, infiltration of inflammatory cells, vascular thrombosis and distribution area of dust cells. The total score of each index is the final score of histopathological changes for each lobe of lung. The average of scores from all lobes is referred to the histopathological score for the whole lung of each animal.
K D values for SPR assays were calculated by the software BIAevaluation Version 3.0 (GE Healthcare) using 1:1 binding model.
Pseudovirus neutralization titer (pVNT 50 ) was determined by fitting nonlinear regression curves using GraphPad Prism and calculating the reciprocal of the serum dilution required for 50% neutralization of infection. The values shown are GMT ± 95% CI. The endpoint titer of antigen-binding IgG and 50% neutralization titer of authentic SARS-CoV-2 were shown as GMT ± 95% CI. Details can be found in figures legends.
The NAb titers and pulmonary viral gRNA were analyzed with a linear model using GraphPad Prism. Details can be found in figures legends.
Pooled analyses of pathological scores for lung tissues were shown as means ± SEM. P -values were analyzed with two-tailed Mann Whitney test. Details can be found in figures legends.
P -values were analyzed with two-tailed Mann Whitney test or two-tailed unpaired t test (ns, p > 0.05; ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p <0.001; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001). Details can be found in figures legends.
