Title: Single-cell landscape of the ecosystem in early-relapse hepatocellular carcinoma


Abstract: Summary

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high relapse and low 5-year survival rates. Single-cell profiling in relapsed HCC may aid in the design of effective anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies. We profiled the transcriptomes of ∼17,000 cells from 18 primary or early-relapse HCC cases. Early-relapse tumors have reduced levels of regulatory T cells, increased dendritic cells (DCs), and increased infiltrated CD8 + T cells, compared with primary tumors, in two independent cohorts. Remarkably, CD8 + T cells in recurrent tumors overexpressed KLRB1 (CD161) and displayed an innate-like low cytotoxic state, with low clonal expansion, unlike the classical exhausted state observed in primary HCC. The enrichment of these cells was associated with a worse prognosis. Differential gene expression and interaction analyses revealed potential immune evasion mechanisms in recurrent tumor cells that dampen DC antigen presentation and recruit innate-like CD8 + T cells. Our comprehensive picture of the HCC ecosystem provides deeper insights into immune evasion mechanisms associated with tumor relapse.

Section: Introduction

Liver cancer is the fourth-highest cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide ( Bray et al., 2018 6. Bray, F. ∙ Ferlay, J. ∙ Soerjomataram, I. ... Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries CA Cancer J. Clin. 2018; 68 :394-424 Crossref Scopus (61553) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the predominant form of liver cancer, accounting for 75%–85% of cases ( Singal et al., 2020 63. Singal, A.G. ∙ Lampertico, P. ∙ Nahon, P. Epidemiology and surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma: New trends J. Hepatol. 2020; 72 :250-261 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (615) PubMed Google Scholar ), for which surgical resection represents the most effective treatment, with curative potential ( Zhou et al., 2020 89. Zhou, J. ∙ Sun, H.C. ∙ Wang, Z. ... Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment Hepatocellular Carcinoma (2019 Edition) Liver Cancer. 2020; 9 :682-720 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the high incidence of tumor relapse (50%–70% 5 years after surgery) has hindered improved survival ( European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2018 22. European Association for the Study of the Liver EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Management of hepatocellular carcinoma J. Hepatol. 2018; 69 :182-236 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5769) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, early recurrence within 2 years after surgery accounts for 70% of relapsed HCC cases, is rarely treatable, and has been associated with poor survival ( Zheng et al., 2017b 88. Zheng, J. ∙ Kuk, D. ∙ Gönen, M. ... Actual 10-Year Survivors After Resection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Ann. Surg. Oncol. 2017; 24 :1358-1366 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). The molecular mechanisms associated with rapid postoperative recurrence remain poorly understood. A thorough exploration of tumor relapse could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms associated with tumor development and progression and help discover more effective therapeutic strategies for HCC.
Tumors are complex ecosystems, defined by spatiotemporal interactions among heterogeneous cell types, including malignant, immune, and stromal cells ( Wagner et al., 2019 74. Wagner, J. ∙ Rapsomaniki, M.A. ∙ Chevrier, S. ... A Single-Cell Atlas of the Tumor and Immune Ecosystem of Human Breast Cancer Cell. 2019; 177 :1330-1345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). Understanding the interplay of cell types is essential to understand tumor development, prognosis, and treatment. Recently, immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) have shown clinical benefits in several types of cancer, although the response rates in HCC were unsatisfactory ( El-Khoueiry et al., 2017 20. El-Khoueiry, A.B. ∙ Sangro, B. ∙ Yau, T. ...

Hepatol. 2019; 71 :543-552 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). The immune microenvironment might affect the treatment efficacy of ICBs ( House et al., 2020 28. House, I.G. ∙ Savas, P. ∙ Lai, J. ... Macrophage-Derived CXCL9 and CXCL10 Are Required for Antitumor Immune Responses Following Immune Checkpoint Blockade Clin. Cancer Res. 2020; 26 :487-504 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, dissecting the tumor ecosystem in HCC could provide insights into immune evasion mechanisms which might be helpful to design more effective immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC, especially for patients with relapsed tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for the investigation of the cellular components and their interactions in the tumor microenvironment ( Azizi et al., 2018 4.

ScRNA-seq has also been used to elucidate the association between some tumor microenvironmental patterns and clinical outcomes in several cancer types ( Guo et al., 2018 25. Guo, X. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Global characterization of T cells in non-small-cell lung cancer by single-cell sequencing Nat.

Furthermore, several studies have profiled the single-cell landscape of immune cells and tumor cells’ heterogeneity in primary HCC ( Lim et al., 2019 40. Lim, C.J. ∙ Lee, Y.H. ∙ Pan, L. ...

Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing Cell. 2017; 169 :1342-1356 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a comprehensive depiction of the ecosystem and immune phenotypes in early-relapse HCC at the single-cell resolution level remains lacking.
Here, we dissected the tumor immune microenvironment by examining 16,498 full-length single-cell transcriptomes from 18 primary or early-relapse HCC patients. We observed reduced levels of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and increased fractions of dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8 + T cells in the immune component of early-relapse tumors (RT), compared with those in primary tumors (PT). Interestingly, CD8 + T cells in RT, characterized by overexpression of KLRB1 (CD161), primarily presented an innate-like, low-cytotoxic, and low-clonal-expansion state, with the low expression of co-stimulatory and checkpoint molecules. Patients with more CD161 + CD8 + T cells showed a worse prognosis. We validated these findings in two additional cohorts of paired PT and RT samples, using scRNA-seq or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Our analysis showed that malignant cells in RT have higher immune evasion characteristics, which potentially inhibit the capacity of DCs to activate CD8 + T cells. Our data shed light on the unique aspects of the altered immune response associated with HCC relapse, which might guide the development of rational immunotherapies to benefit a wide range of patients.

Section: Results

To resolve the tumor ecosystem in early-relapse HCC, we collected surgical tumor specimens and paired adjacent non-tumor tissues from 12 treatment-naive primary and 6 early-relapse HCC patients (discovery cohort) for scRNA-seq ( Figure 1 A). Tumors and paired adjacent non-tumor tissues from primary HCC are referred to as PT and primary non-tumor (PNT), respectively, whereas tumors and paired, adjacent, non-tumor tissues from early-relapse HCC are referred to as RT and relapsed non-tumor (RNT). Detailed clinical and pathological information, including tumor stage, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, and tumor size, are provided in Table S1 . Moreover, we recruited four additional patients, with paired PT and early RT samples for scRNA-seq (validation cohort 1), and additional 47 patients, with paired PT and early RT samples to perform IHC and bulk RNA-sequencing validation (validation cohort 2). Validation cohorts were used to confirm differences found in the discovery cohort ( Figure 1 B).
In the discovery cohort, we performed bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES) of cell populations from primary HCC (P08-P19) and early-relapse HCC (P01-P05, P07) tissues and paired PT (P01-P05, P07) samples ( Figure 1 A; STAR methods ). We confirmed that early-relapse HCCs that were investigated here represent recurrent, rather than de novo tumors. They shared more mutations (1,349–3,299; 27%–49% of total mutations in RT) with their paired PT samples than that shared by tumors of different origins from the same patients (0–12 mutations shared, 0%–0.28% of total mutations) ( Yates et al., 2017 82. Yates, L.R. ∙ Knappskog, S. ∙ Wedge, D. ... Genomic Evolution of Breast Cancer Metastasis and Relapse Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :169-184 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (459) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phylogenetic analysis ( Leshchiner et al., 2018 38. Leshchiner, I. ∙ Livitz, D. ∙ Gainor, J.F. ... Comprehensive analysis of tumour initiation, spatial and temporal progression under multiple lines of treatment bioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), based on shared somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions-deletions (INDELs), also show that the RT and paired PT samples are clonally related ( Figure S1 A).
Due to differences in patients’ immune infiltration levels, we applied fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate CD45 + and CD45 – cells ( Figure S1 B). To obtain sufficient cell numbers to investigate the immune components in tumors, we sorted CD45 + and CD45 – cells, at a ratio of 3:1 (1,500 versus 500 cells), from each patient, and generated scRNA-seq libraries, using the microwell full-length mRNA amplification and library construction system (MIRALCS) ( Wu et al., 2015 78. Wu, L. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Zhao, Z. ... Full-length single-cell RNA-seq applied to a viral human cancer: applications to HPV expression and splicing analysis in HeLa S3 cells Gigascience. 2015; 4 :51 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 16,498 cells passing the quality control stage were used for further analysis (119–1,617 cells; median: 926 cells / patient), which generated ∼12 million total mapped reads and 3,490 (transcripts per million [TPM] >1) detected genes, on average ( Figure S1 C; Table S2 ).
To construct a global tumor niche atlas, we performed cell classification and marker gene identification using Seurat ( STAR methods ). We identified and visualized 24 clusters using the T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method ( Figure 1 C; STAR methods ). All cells (both immune and non-immune fractions) expressed high levels of housekeeping genes, such as ACTB , B2M , and GAPDH ( Figure S1 D), whereas immune cells were PTPRC + , as expected ( Figure S1 E), indicating the accuracy of our data.
Non-immune cells primarily consisted of endothelial cells (ECs; PECAM1 and CDH5 ), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs; ACTA2 and PDGFRB ), apparently normal epithelial cells ( EPCAM and KRT19 ), and HCC malignant cells ( Figures 1 D and S1 E). Low proportions of ECs and HSCs (<5% of total non-immune cells) were observed in most patients ( Figures 1 E and 1F). We observed the enrichment of THY1 , a hepatic cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ( Yamashita et al., 2013 81. Yamashita, T. ∙ Honda, M. ∙ Nakamoto, Y. ... Discrete nature of EpCAM+ and CD90+ cancer stem cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hepatology. 2013; 57 :1484-1497 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ), in HSCs ( Figure S1 F), suggesting that this gene may not be an accurate CSC marker. Our data also indicated that most non-immune cells in tumors were malignant cells, expressing hepatocyte-like genes ( ALB , TTR , and APOA2 ) ( Figures 1 D and S1 E). The tumor origins were confirmed by the detection of copy number variants (CNVs), inferred by scRNA-seq data ( Figure S1 G; STAR methods ). Similarly, we noticed that cluster 12 (only observed in patient P16) showed low expression of hepatic genes and AFP ( Figure S1 E), consistent with the IHC results ( Figure S1 H). These cells were also defined as HCC malignant cells by inferred CNVs and covering SNVs detected at the bulk level ( Figures S1 G and S1I). In agreement with previous reports ( Puram et al., 2017 55. Puram, S.V. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Parikh, A.S. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Primary and Metastatic Tumor Ecosystems in Head and Neck Cancer Cell. 2017; 171 :1611-1624 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1400) PubMed Google Scholar ), malignant cells were separated by patients ( Figures 1 C and 1E). We did not observe clusters of normal hepatocytes, likely due to the well-known technical limitations associated with obtaining these cells from non-tumor liver tissues.
The identified immune cells included myeloid-derived cells ( LYZ and C1QB ), T cells ( CD3D/G ), B cells ( MS4A1 and CD79A ), plasma cells ( IGLL1 and MZB1 ), and natural killer (NK) cells ( KLRF1 and KLRD1 ) ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 E). All these cell subtypes were shared among patients and between PT and RT samples, albeit at different proportions ( Figures 1 E and 1F). The infiltration levels of B cells, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and plasma cells were relatively low in all patients. Other immune cell clusters varied among patients, revealing substantial heterogeneity of immune cell compositions among HCC tumors ( Figure 1 F). In summary, despite this variability, RT and PT samples shared the same major immune cell subtypes and similar proportions of lymphoid- and myeloid-derived cells ( Figure S1 J).
We next performed unsupervised clustering of myeloid cells and T cells/NKs. A total of 11 clusters emerged within the myeloid lineage, including five clusters for macrophages (Macro1–Macro5), two for monocytes (Mono1 and Mono2), three for DCs (DC1–DC3), and one for actively cycling cells ( Figures 2 A–2C).
Macrophages were identified by high expression levels of CD163 and CD68 . The clusters Macro2–Macro5 showed patient bias, consistent with previous reports ( Kumar et al., 2018 34. Kumar, M.P. ∙ Du, J. ∙ Lagoudas, G. ... Analysis of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Identifies Cell-Cell Communication Associated with Tumor Characteristics Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :1458-1468 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the distinct microenvironment of each tumor contributes to the heterogeneity of this population ( Figures 2 B and S2 A). Macrophages were significantly enriched in tumors compared with paired adjacent non-tumor tissues and displayed similar proportions in the immune fractions of RT and PT samples ( Figures S2 B and S2D). We could not clearly distinguish M1 and M2 macrophages using known marker genes such as FCGR3A (M1) and CD163 (M2), as they were both expressed in those cells ( Figure S2 A), consistent with a previous report ( Azizi et al., 2018 4. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1121) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, by calculating M1 and M2 polarization and pro- and anti-inflammatory scores using related gene sets ( Table S3 ; STAR methods ), we observed a dominant M2-like phenotype ( Figure S2 C). Mono1 cells displayed high expression levels of FCN1 , APOBEC3A , and THBS1 ( Figures 2 C and S2 A), like the M-c1-THBS1 cells ( Zhang et al., 2019 86. Zhang, Q. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Luo, N. ... Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell. 2019; 179 :829-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (776) PubMed Google Scholar ) that were recently reported in HCCs. The Mono2 cluster was characterized by PRF1 , GNLY , and KLRC4-KLRK1 expression ( Figure S2 A), showing similar characteristics with reported Mono4 cells ( Villani et al., 2017 73. Villani, A.C. ∙ Satija, R. ∙ Reynolds, G. ... Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors Science. 2017; 356 :eaah4573 Crossref Scopus (1494) PubMed Google Scholar ). None of these subtypes was associated with liver-resident Kupffer cells ( MARCO + ) ( MacParland et al., 2018 43. MacParland, S.A. ∙ Liu, J.C. ∙ Ma, X.Z. ... Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic macrophage populations Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4383 Crossref Scopus (792) PubMed Google Scholar ) or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs, CD33 + ) ( Eruslanov et al., 2012 21. Eruslanov, E. ∙ Neuberger, M. ∙ Daurkin, I. ... Circulating and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell subsets in patients with bladder cancer Int. J. Cancer. 2012; 130 :1109-1119 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ; Poschke and Kiessling, 2012 54. Poschke, I. ∙ Kiessling, R. On the armament and appearances of human myeloid-derived suppressor cells Clin. Immunol. 2012; 144 :250-268 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 A).
Total DCs showed variation among patients, ranging from 0.1%–20% of the total immune fraction. This proportion was higher in RT than in PT samples and higher in RNT than in PNT samples ( Figures 2 D and S2 D). Dual-color IHC staining verified the increased abundance of DCs (IDO + CD45 + or CD1c + CD45 + ) in RT versus PT from the validation cohort 2 ( Figures 2 E and 2F). HCC infiltrated DCs (HCC DCs) had unique transcriptional profiles compared with the reported datasets ( Villani et al., 2017 73. Villani, A.C. ∙ Satija, R. ∙ Reynolds, G. ... Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors Science. 2017; 356 :eaah4573 Crossref Scopus (1494) PubMed Google Scholar ) for DCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). HCC DCs exhibited increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II molecules ( HLA-DQB2 and HLA-DPB1 ) and BIRC3 and downregulation of MHC-I genes ( HLA-A and HLA-C ) compared with PBMC DCs ( Figure S2 E), indicating that MHC-II antigen-presentation was dominant in tumors. In contrast with PBMC DCs, only a portion of HCC DC1 cells ( CLEC9A ) expressed the classical DC1 marker gene THBD (CD141) ( Figure S2 F). DC2 cells ( CD1C and CLEC10A ), like previously reported CD1C + DCs ( Villani et al., 2017 73. Villani, A.C. ∙ Satija, R. ∙ Reynolds, G. ... Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors Science. 2017; 356 :eaah4573 Crossref Scopus (1494) PubMed Google Scholar ), also had unique signatures ( Figure S2 E). HCC DC2 cells showed a high expression of CD1E while lacking CD14 , VCAN , S100A9 , SELL , and S100A8 , compared with PBMC DC2 cells ( Figure S2 F). We noticed that AXL was extremely enriched in HCC DC2 cells ( Figure S2 F), suggesting their migratory features. DC3 cells ( CCL19 , LAMP3 , and CCR7 ) could represent a tumor-specific DC subpopulation, because they were also detected in our reanalysis of melanoma ( Tirosh et al., 2016 69. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Crossref Scopus (2623) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 G) and head and neck head cancer ( Puram et al., 2017 55. Puram, S.V. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Parikh, A.S. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Primary and Metastatic Tumor Ecosystems in Head and Neck Cancer Cell. 2017; 171 :1611-1624 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1400) PubMed Google Scholar ) datasets ( Figure S2 H), but were not found in PBMCs. According to published studies ( Saban, 2014 60. Saban, D.R. The chemokine receptor CCR7 expressed by dendritic cells: a key player in corneal and ocular surface inflammation Ocul. Surf. 2014; 12 :87-99 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Worbs et al., 2017 77. Worbs, T. ∙ Hammerschmidt, S.I. ∙ Förster, R. Dendritic cell migration in health and disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :30-48 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2019 86. Zhang, Q. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Luo, N. ... Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell. 2019; 179 :829-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (776) PubMed Google Scholar ), DC3 cells have the potential to migrate to lymph nodes. Among the three DC subsets, only DC2, which presents specific antigens to CD4 + but not CD8 + T cells, resided in RT samples ( Figure 2 D).
The re-clustering of T cells/NKs revealed 17 populations, including two NK subtypes (NK CD16 and CD160), four subtypes of CD4 + T cells (CD4 CCR7, CD4 IL2, Treg FOXP3, and Treg LAYN), and seven clusters of CD8 + T cells (CD8 CCR6, CD8 NR4A1, CD8 GZMK, CD8 XCL1, CD8 CTLA4, and CD8 LAG3) ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). All these subtypes were shared across patients and between PT and RT samples ( Figure 3 B). NK CD160 ( CD160 ) cells were enriched in adjacent non-tumor tissues (PNT and RNT) and showed high expression levels of CD69 , NR4A1 , CD160 , and C XCR6 and low level of FCGR3A , suggesting that they represent tissue-resident memory NK cells ( Figure S3 B). NK CD16 ( FCGR3A ) cells overexpressed cytotoxic genes, including GNLY , GZMB , and PRF1 , the inhibitory-related gene HAVCR2 ( Al Omar et al., 2011 1. Al Omar, S.Y. ∙ Marshall, E. ∙ Middleton, D. ... Increased killer immunoglobulin-like receptor expression and functional defects in natural killer cells in lung cancer Immunology. 2011; 133 :94-104 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 C), and inhibitory KIRs ( KIR2DL - 1 and KIR2DL - 3 ) ( Figure S3 B). The high expression of FCGR3A suggested that these cells may be recruited from the peripheral blood ( MacParland et al., 2018 43. MacParland, S.A. ∙ Liu, J.C. ∙ Ma, X.Z. ... Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic macrophage populations Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4383 Crossref Scopus (792) PubMed Google Scholar ). NK CD16 cells were the primary NKs found in tumors, demonstrating that peripheral NKs are the primary source of tumor-infiltrating NKs ( Figure S3 D).
A higher diversity of T cells was observed in tumors than in adjacent non-tumor tissues ( Figure S3 E). Tregs (Treg FOXP3 and Treg LAYN) highly expressed IL2RA , FOXP3 , and CTLA4 ( Figures 2 I and S3 A). Treg FOXP3 cells were enriched in tumors, particularly in PT samples ( Figures 3 D and S3 C), and displayed increased expression of CD27 , FOXP3 , and LAIR2 ( Figure S3 A). Conversely, Treg LAYN cells showed increased expression of LAYN , TNFRSF9 , and ICOS ( Figure 3 C), like the previously reported immunosuppressive TNFRSF9 + Tregs ( Guo et al., 2018 25. Guo, X. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Global characterization of T cells in non-small-cell lung cancer by single-cell sequencing Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :978-985 Crossref Scopus (914) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to the increased abundance of Treg FOXP3 in tumors, Treg LAYN cells were detected in a few patients and in small proportions ( Figure 3 D). A cluster of T cells was designated as cycling cells due to overexpressing cell cycle-related genes ( HMGN2 , RRM2 , and MKI67 ) ( Figure S3 A). These cells were composed of Tregs and CD8 + T cells, with either high cytotoxic ( GZMA , NKG7 , and GZMK ) or exhausted signals ( CTLA - 4 , TIGIT , and PDCD1 ) ( Figures S3 F and S3G), implying that both cytotoxic and suppressive cells had enhanced proliferative capacities. A smaller fraction of cycling cells was observed in RT than PT samples, reflecting the relatively quiescent immune response of RT ( Figure 3 D). A cluster of CD8 + T cells (CD8 CCR6 cells) was characterized by specifically expressing CCR6 and was partially composed (22%) of mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT). MAIT cells are defined by uniquely rearranged T cell receptors (TCR; TRAV1-2, TRAJ33, TRAJ20, or TRAJ12) ( Treiner et al., 2003 70. Treiner, E. ∙ Duban, L. ∙ Bahram, S. ... Selection of evolutionarily conserved mucosal-associated invariant T cells by MR1 Nature. 2003; 422 :164-169 Crossref Scopus (856) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 H). As previously reported ( Zheng et al., 2017a 87. Zheng, C. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Yoo, J.K. ... Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing Cell. 2017; 169 :1342-1356 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ), CD8 GZMK cells displayed the high expression of the cytotoxic genes GZMK , GZMA , and NKG7 and the low expression of all checkpoint genes, suggesting that these cells are precursors of cytotoxic T cells ( Figure 3 C). These cells represented a large proportion of CD8 + T cells in adjacent non-tumor tissues ( Figure S3 C). We also observed that the transcriptional profile of CD8 GZMH cells was like the reported CD8 CXCR3 cells ( Zheng et al., 2017a 87. Zheng, C. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Yoo, J.K. ... Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing Cell. 2017; 169 :1342-1356 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because CD8 NR4A1 cells showed the highest expression of activator protein 1 (AP-1; JUN and FOSB ), NR4A1 , CD69 , and RUNX3 , we designated them as liver-tissue-resident, memory-like T cells ( Figures 3 C and S3 A). CD8 XCL1 cells highly expressed genes associated with cytotoxicity ( GZMA , GZMB , and GZMK ) and moderately expressed exhaustion-related markers ( TIGHT , CTLA4 , and LAG3 ) ( Figure 3 I and S3 A). CD8 CTLA4 and CD8 LAG3 cells showed elevated expression of T cell exhaustion markers ( PDCD1 , HAVCR2 , CTLA4 , TIGIT , and LAG3 ) ( Figures 3 C and S3 A). CD8 CCR6 and CD8 NR4A1 cells had a rising trend of proportions in RT than PT samples, whereas CD8 XCL1 cells were enriched in PT ( Figure 3 D). Although none of the CD8 + T cell subtypes showed significant differences between RT and PT samples ( Figure 3 D), the total fraction of CD8 + T subtypes were more abundant in RT versus PT (79.7% versus 39.9% of total T cells, p < 0.001; Figure 3 E). In contrast, the proportions of CD4 + T cells displayed the opposite trend ( Figure 3 E).
In summary, relapsed HCC presents a unique immune ecosystem, with increased proportions of DCs, reduced Tregs, reduced T cell proliferation, and a higher abundance of CD8 + T cells compared with the primary HCC microenvironment ( Figures 2 D, 3 C, and 3E). These observations were validated by performing scRNA-seq in the 4 PT and RT pairs from validation cohort 1 ( Figure S3 I) and by performing IHC in the 47 paired PT and RT samples from validation cohort 2 ( Figures 2 F, 3 F, and S3 J).
We next explored the dynamic immune states and cell transitions in HCC-infiltrated CD8 + T cells by inferring the state trajectories using Monocle ( Figure 4 A; STAR methods ). In pseudotime analysis, we removed MAIT cells, due to their differing TCR characteristics, and CD8 LAG3 cells, due to low expression of CD3D/G/E . This analysis showed that the CD8 CCR6 cells were at the beginning of the trajectory path, whereas the CD8 CLTA4 cells and most CD8 XCL1 cells at a terminal state ( Figure 4 A). By integrating TCR clonality ( Figure S4 A; STAR methods ) and trajectory information, this transition was determined to initiate with CD8 CCR6 and CD8 NR4A1 cells, through an intermediate cytotoxic state characterized by CD8 GZMH and CD8 GZMK cells, and finally reach an exhausted state, characterized by CD8 CLTA4 and CD8 XCL1 cells. Based on the TCR clonal expansion observed among various cell types, we observed that CD8 XCL1 cells shared more TCR clones with cytotoxic subtypes (CD8 GZMH and CD8 GZMK cells) than with CD8 CLTA4 cells ( Figure S4 A). Additionally, CD8 XCL1 cells expressed lower exhausted scores than CD8 CLTA4 cells ( Figure S4 B), revealing that these cells represent an earlier exhausted state. We confirmed that the exhausted signature was upregulated, whereas the cytotoxic signature, despite an initial increase, was downregulated during these transitions ( Figure 4 B; STAR methods ).
To further delineate the transition states associated with CD8 + T cells in RT samples, we analyzed the trajectories of CD8 + T cells in PT and RT samples separately. Surprisingly, early-stage CD8 + T cells were predominantly distributed in RT samples, with few cells identified at the end of the cell state transition path, whereas CD8 + T cells in PT samples were primarily at the terminal ends of the cytotoxic and exhausted states ( Figure 4 C). We next investigated the transcriptional changes associated with transitional states and observed that the CD8 + T cell clusters could be categorized into 4 phases ( Figure 4 D). CD8 CCR6 and CD8 NR4A1 cells were predominantly phase 1 cells, characterized by upregulated expression of CCR6 , CCR7 , NCR3 , and KLRB1 and low expression of GZMA , GZMB , and GZMH , suggesting that these cells had the lowest cytotoxic capacities ( Figures 4 D and S4 C). Pathway analysis indicated that signaling pathways involved in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor signaling, were enriched in phase 1 ( Figure 4 D). The analysis of energy metabolism pathways showed that phase 1 cells exhibited the highest expression scores for lipogenesis, glycolysis, and glutamine metabolism and equivalent scores for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and lipolysis ( Figures 4 E and S4 D; STAR methods ). Metabolic analysis suggested that the functions of phase 1 cells rely on fatty acid oxidation and aerobic glycolysis, rather than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHO). This finding indicated that phase 1 cells were different from classical naive cells ( Zhang and Romero, 2018 84. Zhang, L. ∙ Romero, P. Metabolic Control of CD8 + T Cell Fate Decisions and Antitumor Immunity Trends Mol. Med. 2018; 24 :30-48 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ) and were more closely related to a memory phenotype ( O’Sullivan et al., 2014 46. O’Sullivan, D. ∙ van der Windt, G.J. ∙ Huang, S.C. ... Memory CD8(+) T cells use cell-intrinsic lipolysis to support the metabolic programming necessary for development Immunity. 2014; 41 :75-88 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (572) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternative splicing analysis of CD45 demonstrated that these cells prefer CD45RO rather than CD45RA, indicating that they have been previously activated rather than being naive. The analysis of transcription factors (TFs) expressed in these cells revealed significant upregulation of FOXP1 , KLF10 , DNAJC2 , BCL11B , ELK3 , and NFKB1 ( Figures 4 F and S4 E). FOXP1 inhibits both cell proliferation and GZMB expression in CD8 + T cells ( Wei et al., 2016 76. Wei, H. ∙ Geng, J. ∙ Shi, B. ... Cutting Edge: Foxp1 Controls Naive CD8+ T Cell Quiescence by Simultaneously Repressing Key Pathways in Cellular Metabolism and Cell Cycle Progression J. Immunol. 2016; 196 :3537-3541 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), appearing as a hallmark of unresponsiveness, dampening CD8 + T cells antitumor effector functions. FOXP1 also mediated TGF-β-induced c-JUN transcriptional repression, showing unique functions for survival maintenance in memory T cells ( Stephen et al., 2014 64. Stephen, T.L. ∙ Rutkowski, M.R. ∙ Allegrezza, M.J. ... Transforming growth factor β-mediated suppression of antitumor T cells requires FoxP1 transcription factor expression Immunity. 2014; 41 :427-439 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). KLF10 plays a role in suppressing CD8 + T cell activation, as Klf10 -deficient mice display more effector CD8 + T cells ( Papadakis et al., 2015 49. Papadakis, K.A. ∙ Krempski, J. ∙ Reiter, J. ... Krüppel-like factor KLF10 regulates transforming growth factor receptor II expression and TGF-β signaling in CD8+ T lymphocytes Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 308 :C362-C371 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells in phase 2 demonstrated the highest expression levels of JUN , FOS , NR4A1 , and NR4A3 , matching the phenotypes of liver resident memory cells ( Figures 4 D, 4F, and S4 E). Phase 3 was characterized by increased expression levels of classical cytotoxic genes ( GZMH , GZMB , GZMA , and GNLY ) and low expression of T cell exhaustion markers ( PDCD1 , CTLA4 , and HAVCR2 ) ( Figures 4 D, 4G, S4 C, and S4E). Pathway analysis suggested that cells in phase 3 were dependent on fatty acid metabolism, consistent with effector phenotypes and fatty acids representing a primary energy resource for effector T cells. Phase 4 was characterized by high levels of T cell exhaustion-related TFs, including EOMES , TOX , TOX2 , HOPX ARNT , ETV1 , and IRF8 , and genes involved in programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and mitotic pathways, further confirming the exhausted state of these cells ( Figures 4 D–4F and S4 E).
Interestingly, the checkpoint molecules PDCD1 and LAYN were only modestly upregulated during the transition between the cytotoxic (phase 3) and exhausted states (phase 4), whereas CTLA4 and HAVCR2 expression increased by as much as 10-fold ( Figures 4 G and S4 E). The elevated expression of BTLA was only observed in PT, whereas LAG3 and TIGIT expression gradually increased from the inactivated to exhausted states ( Figure 4 G). These results demonstrated that the expression of immune checkpoints is heterogeneous during the CD8 + T cell state transition process ( Figures 4 G and S4 E). Specific targeting strategies may be beneficial for the application of ICB therapeutic regimens to HCC patients. CD8 + T cells from RT samples were primarily characterized as phases 1 and 2, with only a few representing the exhausted phase 4, indicating a resident-memory phenotype. In contrast, CD8 + T cells in PT were predominantly characterized as phases 3 and 4, representing the transition process from cytotoxic to exhausted states ( Figure 4 H). Despite RT and PT samples displaying comparable fractions of phase 3 cells, they fell into different cytotoxic cell clusters, with RT samples associated with CD8 GZMH cells and PT samples associated with CD8 GZMK cells ( Figure 4 H).
We conclude that CD8 + T cells in PT and RT samples showed the same transition trajectories but displayed considerably different immune and transcriptional states, suggesting that different immune therapy strategies should be considered for the treatment of primary and recurrent HCC.
To further investigate the unique transcriptional states of CD8 + T cells in RT samples, we determined the expression scores of tissue-resident, cytotoxic, co-stimulatory, and exhausted T cell phenotypes ( STAR methods ). CD8 + T cells in RT samples showed reduced expression of exhausted signatures and a decreased fraction of cells expressing checkpoint genes, compared with CD8 + T cells in PT samples ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Tissue-resident genes, such as RUNX3 , NR4A1 , and CD69 , increased, whereas co-stimulatory and exhausted molecules, such as TNFRFS9 , CD28 , ICOS , TIGIT , CTLA4 , and HAVCR2 were reduced ( Figure 5 A). Sc/single nucleus (sn)RNA-seq data for the four additional PT and RT paired samples in the validation cohort 1 also demonstrated increased tissue-resident gene levels and decreased inhibitory/cytotoxic signals in CD8 + T cells from RT samples ( Figure S5 C).
Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis indicated that the top downregulated genes in CD8 + T cells in RT included CD27 , TIGIT , CTLA4 , and BTLA , suggesting low inhibitory signals ( Figure 5 B; Table S4 ). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed that CD8 + T cells in RT were characterized by downregulated OX40 and exhausted T cell signaling pathways, indicating that these cells are in a less activated but not exhausted state ( Figure 5 C). IPA also identified PDGF - BB as the top upstream factor that mediated this phenotype. Because PDGF - BB can inhibit T cell proliferation ( Chen et al., 2014 10. Chen, C.F. ∙ Feng, X. ∙ Liao, H.Y. ... Regulation of T cell proliferation by JMJD6 and PDGF-BB during chronic hepatitis B infection Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :6359 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), we speculated that this might be a primary driver of the non-activated CD8 + T cell state in relapse HCC. Compared with cells in PT samples, CD8 + T cells in RT samples showed an enhanced response to oxidative stress, as indicated by the increased expression of SOD1 , SOD2 , GADD45B , FOS , JUNB , and NFKB1 ( Figures 5 B and 5C; Table S4 ). However, those cells displayed downregulated DUSP4 expression, suggesting an uncontrolled oxidative stress response process ( Dougherty et al., 2017 19. Dougherty, J.A. ∙ Kilbane Myers, J. ∙ Khan, M. ... Dual-Specificity Phosphatase 4 Overexpression in Cells Prevents Hypoxia/Reoxygenation-Induced Apoptosis via the Upregulation of eNOS Front. Cardiovasc. Med. 2017; 4 :22 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, these cells also strongly downregulated the genes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, suggesting possible mitochondrial dysfunction. Metabolic disorders might also contribute to CD8 + T cell dysfunction in RT.
DEG analysis also showed that CD8 + T cells in RT upregulated KLRB1 (CD161) and IL7R , demonstrating an innate-like and memory T cell phenotype ( Ruiz et al., 2014 59. Ruiz, A.L. ∙ Soudja, S.M. ∙ Deceneux, C. ... NK1.1+ CD8+ T cells escape TGF-β control and contribute to early microbial pathogen response Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5150 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 B). The increased expression of KLRG1 , NCR3 , and RORA was also indicative of a type-2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2)-like phenotype ( Chiossone et al., 2018 17. Chiossone, L. ∙ Dumas, P.Y. ∙ Vienne, M. ... Natural killer cells and other innate lymphoid cells in cancer Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :671-688 Crossref Scopus (669) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 B; Table S4 ). By performing dual-color IHC staining assay in the validation cohort 2, we verified the enrichment of CD8 + CD161 + T cells in RT samples (median: 33.3% versus 16.7%, Figures 5 D and 5E). To further assess the effector functions of these cells, we isolated tumor-infiltrated CD8 + CD161 + and CD8 + CD161 – T cells and examined granzyme B (GZMB) expression levels by flow cytometry. CD8 + CD161 + T cells displayed lower GZMB abundance than CD8 + CD161 – T cells, consistent with weaker cytotoxicity ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Furthermore, we found that the enrichment of CD161 + CD8 + T cells in RT was significantly associated with a higher second recurrence rate ( Figure 5 H; n = 47, p < 0.05). Moreover, the comparison of transcriptional profiles between KLRB1 high CD8 T cells and KLRB1 low CD8 T cells identified 255 significant DEGs ( Table S5 ). In KLRB1 high CD8 T cells, we identified significantly increased expression of IL23A and decreased expression of several T cell chemokines ( CCL4 , CCL5 , and CXCL13 ), which might dampen the infiltration of conventional effector CD8 + T cells and NK cells into recurrent tumors ( Harlin et al., 2009 27. Harlin, H. ∙ Meng, Y. ∙ Peterson, A.C. ... Chemokine expression in melanoma metastases associated with CD8+ T-cell recruitment Cancer Res. 2009; 69 :3077-3085 Crossref Scopus (870) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kortlever et al., 2017 32.

Voluntary Running Suppresses Tumor Growth through Epinephrine- and IL-6-Dependent NK Cell Mobilization and Redistribution Cell Metab. 2016; 23 :554-562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, we determined the cellular signatures, normalized against the top 50 upregulated genes associated with KLRB1 high CD8 + T cells ( STAR methods ), to stratify 39 early recurrent patients from validation cohort 2 into high or low groups based on bulk RNA-seq. The high group correlated with significantly poorer clinical prognosis ( Figure S5 D). Analyses of primary HCC cohorts from TCGA ( The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 68. The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive and Integrative Genomic Characterization of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell. 2017; 169 :1327-1341 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1442) PubMed Google Scholar ) also supported a KLRB1 high CD8 T cell signature as a significant indicator of adverse clinical outcomes in HCC patients ( Figure S5 E).
In conclusion, CD8 + T cells in RT samples, characterized by overexpression of KLRB1 , demonstrated an innate-like dysfunctional state, with low cytotoxicity and immunosuppressive phenotypes, which differed from the exhaustion state observed in PT samples. Notably, the enrichment of the gene expression signature associated with KLRB1 high CD8 T cells correlated with poor prognosis and tumor progression in both relapse and primary HCC.
Next, we examined the clonal expansion capacity of CD8 + T cells. T cells that shared the same TCR clones with more than one T cell in the same patient were defined as clonal T cells, and their increase was indicative of clonal expansion. We observed that RT and PT samples had similar abundances of clonal CD8 + T cells (mean: 0.42 versus 0.39; Figure S6 A). However, when we analyzed the proliferative capacities of those cells, we observed that few CD8 + T cells in RT samples were in a cycling state ( Figure 6 A). A higher fraction of CD8 + T cell clones were shared between RT and RNT samples than those shared between PT and PNT samples ( Figure S6 B), revealing that adjacent non-tumor tissues serve as reservoirs that can provide more CD8 + T cells for infiltration into tumor sites in RT. However, the proportion of clonal CD8 + T cells did not change between RT and RNT samples, whereas a significant increase in PT was observed compared with PNT ( Figure 6 B). We further confirmed that the top ten abundant T cell clones represented by complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) in tumors were increased in PT compared with PNT samples, but no difference was observed between RT and RNT samples, based on bulk T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-seq) ( Figure 6 C; STAR methods ). In conclusion, CD8 + T cells did not show clonal expansion in RT samples.
In the paired samples from patient P34, 67% of clonal CD8 + T cells in the RT shared the same TCRs with CD8 + T cells in the PT sample ( Figure 6 D). Among these, most CD8 + T cells in the RT recognized the same antigens as CD8 + T cells in the PT sample. The fractions of cells from shared T cell clones between PT and RT of total CD8 T cells were similar between RT and PT samples (48% versus 48%), revealing that these T cell clones did not show any apparent expansion from PT to RT. Additional gene expression profile comparisons among CD8 + T cells belonging to the same clones in RT and PT samples demonstrated that the dysfunctional, non-activated CD8 + T cell state in RT samples derive from clones that arising in the PT samples, indicating that those cells may represent central memory cells ( Amsen et al., 2018 2. Amsen, D. ∙ van Gisbergen, K.P.J.M. ∙ Hombrink, P. ... Tissue-resident memory T cells at the center of immunity to solid tumors Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :538-546 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 E). Moreover, we observed that malignant cells in RT originated from a minor clone of PT cells by single-cell DNA-seq ( Figure S6 C; STAR methods ), which revealed the loss of the major clone of malignant cells during recurrence. Besides, we also found that at least one major clonal mutation (cancer cell fraction [CCF] >0.8) from the primary tumor was nearly lost (CCF <0.05) in the paired clonal related relapsed tumor in 22 of 24 HCC patients from an independent cohort ( Ding et al., 2019 18. Ding, X. ∙ He, M. ∙ Chan, A.W.H. ... Genomic and Epigenomic Features of Primary and Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinomas Gastroenterology. 2019; 157 :1630-1645 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating the loss of major neoantigens is a common phenomenon in early-relapse HCC. Taken together, this non-activated phenotype of CD8 + T cells in RT samples might be due to the loss of matching neoantigens ( Reading et al., 2018 58. Reading, J.L. ∙ Gálvez-Cancino, F. ∙ Swanton, C. ... The function and dysfunction of memory CD8 + T cells in tumor immunity Immunol. Rev. 2018; 283 :194-212 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ) in recurrent tumor cells.
Our data suggest a model in which CD8 + T cell clones reside in a low proliferative and unresponsive state in RT due in part to tumor selection, suggesting that those cells are unable to recognize and eliminate recurrent tumor cells displaying sub-clonal neoantigens.
Our analyses demonstrated that relapsed HCC was associated with reduced proportions of Tregs and no increase in macrophages or other immune-suppressive T cell subtypes. This led us to hypothesize that the substantial differences in the tumor ecosystem between PT and RT could be caused by differences in malignant cells. To resolve these differences, we performed a DEG analysis between PT and RT malignant cells from the discovery cohort. We observed an enrichment of genes involved in cell-cycle-related pathways (e.g., MYC_targets_V1 and G2M_checkpoint pathways) in PT, whereas the genes upregulated in RT primarily belonged to immune response pathways (e.g., INF_gamma signaling and TNFA_signaling_via_NFKB) ( Figure 7 A; Table S6 ). We also observed that PT samples had higher proliferative and lower hepatic function signals, whereas RT samples presented higher immune surveillance and escape signatures, which were confirmed in validation cohort 1 ( Figures 7 B and S7 A; Table S3 ; STAR methods ). Among the genes related to immune escape, we observed increased CD47 expression in malignant cells from RT, suggesting the potential inhibition of DC maturation and antigen-presentation ( Xu et al., 2017 80. Xu, M.M. ∙ Pu, Y. ∙ Han, D. ... Dendritic Cells but Not Macrophages Sense Tumor Mitochondrial DNA for Cross-priming through Signal Regulatory Protein alpha Signaling Immunity. 2017; 47 :363-373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as resistance against macrophage targeting ( Okazawa et al., 2005 48. Okazawa, H. ∙ Motegi, S. ∙ Ohyama, N. ... Negative regulation of phagocytosis in macrophages by the CD47-SHPS-1 system J. Immunol. 2005; 174 :2004-2011 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tsai and Discher, 2008 71. Tsai, R.K. ∙ Discher, D.E. Inhibition of “self” engulfment through deactivation of myosin-II at the phagocytic synapse between human cells J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180 :989-1003 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a concomitant reduction in neoantigen release. Similarly, we observed increased expression levels of HLA / B / C in RT, indicating an increased resistance to NK-mediated cell death ( Figure 7 C). Patient P07 carried an HLA - B missense mutation in the RT sample that was not found in the corresponding PT sample, potentially resulting in decreased neoantigen peptide presentation in malignant cells. Our data demonstrate that RT possesses low proliferation rates and a high capacity to evade immune-mediated cell death.
We also examined the expression of immune checkpoint ligands and receptors, observing that many genes, such as LGALS9 (ligand for TIM-3), TNFRSF14 (ligand for BTLA), PDCD1LG2 (ligand for PD-1), and VTCN1 (ligand for B7-H1) displayed low expression levels in both primary and relapsed malignant cells ( Figure S7 B). In contrast, FGL1 , which encodes a ligand for LAG3, was abundant in both PT and RT ( Figure S7 B). Moreover, malignant cells from RT showed significantly upregulated CD274 (PD-L1) expression and a slightly higher expression of CTLA4 , compared with PT ( Figure 7 D). Similarly, a higher proportion of CD274 + malignant cells was observed in RT, whereas RT and PT had similar fractions of CTLA4 + malignant cells ( Figures 7 E and S7 C). However, CD8 + T cells in RT harbored reduced exhaustion states compared with those from PT ( Figures S5 A–S5C). We postulated that recurrent malignant cells that overexpressed CD274 or CTLA4 might induce compromised anti-tumor immunity via an alternative method other than classic inhibitory signals. Ligand-receptor (L-R) analysis suggested crosstalk between malignant cells and DC2/DC3 cells, via CD274/CD80 and CTLA4/CD80 interactions in RT but not PT ( Figure 7 F). Due to the higher affinity of CD80 for PD-L1 and CTLA4 than for CD28 ( Butte et al., 2007 7. Butte, M.J. ∙ Keir, M.E. ∙ Phamduy, T.B. ... Programmed death-1 ligand 1 interacts specifically with the B7-1 costimulatory molecule to inhibit T cell responses Immunity. 2007; 27 :111-122 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1385) PubMed Google Scholar ), PD-L1 + or CTLA4 + malignant cells may reduce the efficiency of antigen-presentation and the activation of T cells ( Chen et al., 2017 11. Chen, X. ∙ Shao, Q. ∙ Hao, S. ... CTLA-4 positive breast cancer cells suppress dendritic cells maturation and function Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :13703-13715 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kowalczyk et al., 2014 33. Kowalczyk, A. ∙ D’Souza, C.A. ∙ Zhang, L. Cell-extrinsic CTLA4-mediated regulation of dendritic cell maturation depends on STAT3 Eur. J. Immunol. 2014; 44 :1143-1155 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), which usually occurs through CD80-CD28 interactions between DCs and T cells, during tumor recurrence. We also performed multiplexed immunofluorescent staining to provide evidence that CD80 + CD1C + DCs reside near PD-L1 + relapsed malignant cells, supporting their crosstalk ( Figure 7 G). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that tumor cells released exosomal PD-L1 to compromise antitumor immunity ( Chen et al., 2018a 12. Chen, G. ∙ Huang, A.C. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Exosomal PD-L1 contributes to immunosuppression and is associated with anti-PD-1 response Nature. 2018; 560 :382-386 Crossref Scopus (1765) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further investigate the interactions that occur in the ecosystem, we utilized significant L-R pairs to calculate the strengths of the interactions. Malignant cells showed close interactions with endothelial, CD4 CCR7, and pDC clusters in PT; however, they showed strong regulatory relationships with CD8 NR4A1, CD8 CCR6, and DC1 subtypes in RT ( Figure S7 D). We found that recurrent malignant cells showed the strongest chemokine interactions with CD8 NR4A1 and CD8 CCR6 clusters, via the CCL20-CCR6 axis, suggesting that malignant cells attracted innate-like CD161 + CD8 + T cells ( Jeffery et al., 2017 29. Jeffery, H.C. ∙ McDowell, P. ∙ Lutz, P. ... Human intrahepatic ILC2 are IL-13positive amphiregulinpositive and their frequency correlates with model of end stage liver disease score PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0188649 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), via CCL20 in RT ( Figure S7 E).
In summary, our data demonstrated that malignant cells in the RT exhibited enhanced immune evasion capacities and reduced cellular proliferation. Recurrent malignant cells could compromise antigen presentation in DC cells, via the PD-L1-CD80 and CTLA4-CD80 axes, and to recruit innate-like CD161 + CD8 + T cells via the CCL20-CCR6 axis, which may shape dysfunctional anti-tumor immunity in early-relapse HCC.

Section: Discussion

Despite the progresses in surveillance and treatment strategies, which have improved overall survival rates, the clinical outcomes of HCC remain dismal due to the high incidence of early recurrence, even after surgical resection ( Bosch et al., 2004 5. Bosch, F.X. ∙ Ribes, J. ∙ Díaz, M. ... Primary liver cancer: worldwide incidence and trends Gastroenterology. 2004; 127 :S5-S16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rahbari et al., 2011 57. Rahbari, N.N. ∙ Mehrabi, A. ∙ Mollberg, N.M. ... Hepatocellular carcinoma: current management and perspectives for the future Ann. Surg. 2011; 253 :453-469 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recurrent tumors are often treated based on the molecular and pathological features of the primary tumor, although whether they share similar microenvironment characteristics has not been evaluated. A recent study indicated that primary and early-relapse HCC have similar genomic alterations ( Ding et al., 2019 18. Ding, X. ∙ He, M. ∙ Chan, A.W.H. ... Genomic and Epigenomic Features of Primary and Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinomas Gastroenterology. 2019; 157 :1630-1645 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, differences in the cellular ecosystems between primary and recurrent HCC remain to be deciphered. Here, we provide a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas to characterize tumor ecosystems in primary and early-relapse HCC. Our analysis reveals a distinct immune ecosystem in early-relapse HCC, characterized by reduced fractions of classic immunosuppressive cells Tregs and the increased fractions of DCs and innate-like CD161 + CD8 + T cells, with dysfunctional cytotoxicity and low expansion ( Figure 7 H). Transcriptomic profiling, augmented by L-R based cell-cell interaction analysis, illustrates recurrent malignant cell crosstalk with DCs and T cells, which may compromise antitumor immunity ( Figure 7 H). Our study represents an essential step toward understanding how the immune environment shapes tumor recurrence and reveals the existence of active crosstalk between recurrent malignant cells and immune cells in HCC, facilitating the escape of tumor cells from anti-tumor immunity.
In primary HCC, the landscape of infiltrating T cells is characterized by Tregs enrichment, leading to an immunosuppressive microenvironment ( Zheng et al., 2017a 87. Zheng, C. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Yoo, J.K. ... Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing Cell. 2017; 169 :1342-1356 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we reveal a distinct T cell composition in early-recurrent HCC, characterized by the exclusion of Tregs and enrichment of CD8 + T cells. Compared with CD8 + T cells from PT, CD8 + T cells in RT possessed remarkably different transcriptional characteristics, with significantly decreased expression of exhaustion, proliferation, and cytotoxicity signatures and elevated expression of tissue-residence genes. Moreover, DEG analysis suggested that CD8 + T cells derived from RT were characterized by the overexpression of KLRB1 (CD161), KLRG1 , NCR3 , RORA , and IL7R , suggesting an innate-like and memory phenotype ( Chiossone et al., 2018 17.

Immunol. 2018; 18 :671-688 Crossref Scopus (669) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fergusson et al., 2014 23. Fergusson, J.R. ∙ Smith, K.E. ∙ Fleming, V.M. ...

Inflammation directs memory precursor and short-lived effector CD8(+) T cell fates via the graded expression of T-bet transcription factor Immunity. 2007; 27 :281-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1402) PubMed Google Scholar ). In microbial infection settings, KLRB1 high CD8 T cells comprise a pool of resting memory cells, expressing both KLRG1 and IL7R , which contribute to the early control of microbial recall infections caused by the same pathogen, in both antigen-dependent and -independent manners ( Obar et al., 2011 47. Obar, J.J. ∙ Jellison, E.R. ∙ Sheridan, B.S. ... Pathogen-induced inflammatory environment controls effector and memory CD8+ T cell differentiation J.

NK1.1+ CD8+ T cells escape TGF-β control and contribute to early microbial pathogen response Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5150 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). The adaptive immune response of memory CD8 + T cells is considered a central component of the immune response to the disseminated disease ( Amsen et al., 2018 2. Amsen, D. ∙ van Gisbergen, K.P.J.M. ∙ Hombrink, P. ... Tissue-resident memory T cells at the center of immunity to solid tumors Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :538-546 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, early recurrence developed, regardless of the significant elevation of CD161 + CD8 + T cell infiltration, suggesting that these T cells are unable to prevent the intrahepatic dissemination of HCC. We also demonstrate a significantly lower production of granzyme B by CD161 + CD8 + T cells than CD161 − CD8 + T cells, supporting their poor anti-tumor function. TCR analysis indicated that CD8 + T cells in RT show limited clonal expansion and share most of TCR clone types with their counterparts in PT. This finding implies that CD161 + CD8 + T cells in RT could mount an efficient immune response, targeting clonal neoantigens in primary tumors but not effectively activated in RT. Further analysis of sequencing data from paired primary and recurrent tumor cells revealed that the origin of early-relapse tumor cells was subclonal. Therefore, minor subclones, rather than major clones, fuel early recurrence, and become the dominant clones in recurrent tumors ( Angelova et al., 2018 3. Angelova, M. ∙ Mlecnik, B. ∙ Vasaturo, A. ... Evolution of Metastases in Space and Time under Immune Selection Cell. 2018; 175 :751-765 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). The loss of major clonal mutations of the primary tumor in the corresponding clonal-related relapsed tumor is in agreement with recent data ( Ding et al., 2019 18. Ding, X. ∙ He, M. ∙ Chan, A.W.H. ... Genomic and Epigenomic Features of Primary and Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinomas Gastroenterology. 2019; 157 :1630-1645 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). This loss of major clonal neoantigens during recurrence may explain why CD161 + CD8 + T cells with memory phenotypes cannot prevent recurrence, because they are unable to recognize minor subclonal neoantigens in RT. Moreover, KLRB1 high CD8 T cells downregulated T cell recruitment chemokines ( CCL4 , CCL5 , and CXCL13 ) and upregulated the exclusion chemokine ( IL23A ), dampening the infiltration of functional effector CD8 + T cells into recurrent tumors ( Harlin et al., 2009 27. Harlin, H. ∙ Meng, Y. ∙ Peterson, A.C. ...

DCs excel at antigen presentation and play a vital role in priming anti-tumor T cell immunity. In our study, the increased infiltration of DCs was not associated with boosted effector functions of CD8 + T cells in RT, implicating a compromised antigen presentation function in RT. Co-signaling pathways in the B7-CD28 family provide critical signals that regulate T cell activation and inhibition ( Chen, 2004 9. Chen, L. Co-inhibitory molecules of the B7-CD28 family in the control of T-cell immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4 :336-347 Crossref Scopus (1098) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that relapsed HCC exhibited a higher proportion of CD274 + (PD-L1) malignant cells than primary tumors. Due to the increased affinity of CD80 for PD-L1 compared with CD28 ( Butte et al., 2007 7. Butte, M.J. ∙ Keir, M.E. ∙ Phamduy, T.B. ... Programmed death-1 ligand 1 interacts specifically with the B7-1 costimulatory molecule to inhibit T cell responses Immunity. 2007; 27 :111-122 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1385) PubMed Google Scholar ), CD80 on a DC might preferentially bind to PD-L1 on recurrent tumor cells rather than CD28 on a resting T cell. The multicolor immunofluorescence staining of early-relapse HCC confirmed the physical juxtaposition of PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and CD80-expressing DCs. Therefore, one potential immune evasion mechanism of early-recurrent HCC could involve PD-L1 + tumor cells, reducing CD80-CD28 interactions through the competitive binding of PD-L1 to CD80, which, in turn, prevents T cell activation from killing tumor cells. Concerning the inability of CD161 + CD8 + T cells to perform a recurrent tumor-specific cytolytic attack, induction of neoantigen release from relapsed tumors by chemotherapy or targeted therapy might activate naive CD8 + T cells and lead to clonal expansion of recurrent tumor-specific CD8 + T cells ( Peng et al., 2019 52. Peng, M. ∙ Mo, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Neoantigen vaccine: an emerging tumor immunotherapy Mol. Cancer. 2019; 18 :128 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, PD-L1 blockade could replenish the co-stimulatory signaling pathways between DC and CD8 T cells, which is compromised by PD-L1 expression on recurrent tumor cells. Together with emerging clinical trial data, our results suggested that tumor immunotherapy, combined with targeted therapies or chemotherapy, might be a more rational treatment approach than an ICB as a single agent for patients with recurrent HCC.
The different efficacies of ICB therapies among patients and cancer types suggest the need to identify which patients are likely to benefit from ICBs and establish optimal immunotherapeutic strategies, based on a better understanding of the heterogeneity of the immune checkpoint expression in the primary and recurrent/metastatic HCC microenvironment. ICB therapy resulted in only 16%–20% objective response rates among advanced HCC patients ( Cheng et al., 2020 15. Cheng, A.L. ∙ Hsu, C. ∙ Chan, S.L. ... Challenges of combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma J. Hepatol. 2020; 72 :307-319 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data revealed that PDCD1 (PD-1) was expressed in a small proportion of T cells, and HAVCR2 and CTLA4 displayed higher expression, indicating that TIM-3 or CTLA-4 blockades might be of more significant benefit for HCC treatment. These findings may explain, at least in part, the better response rates observed in clinical trials that use a combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors (CheckMate-040 trial; 31% patients responding to treatment) ( Yau et al., 2019 83. Yau, T. ∙ Hsu, C. ∙ Kim, T.Y. ... Nivolumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: Sorafenib-experienced Asian cohort analysis J. Hepatol. 2019; 71 :543-552 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ), compared with those using PD-1 inhibitors alone (KEYNOTE-224 trial; 17.3% of patients responding to treatment) ( Zhu et al., 2018 90. Zhu, A.X. ∙ Finn, R.S. ∙ Edeline, J. ..., KEYNOTE-224 investigators Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with sorafenib (KEYNOTE-224): a non-randomised, open-label phase 2 trial Lancet Oncol. 2018; 19 :940-952 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1773) PubMed Google Scholar ). More importantly, we found the reduced expression of immune checkpoint genes CTLA4 , HAVCR2 , and TIGIT in T cells from relapsed tumors, suggesting that checkpoint blockade approaches that target these markers might be effective for primary HCC, but not in recurrent patients. Recurrent tumor cells presented the increased expression of CD47 , an antiphagocytic “don’t eat me” signal. A CD47 blockade inhibits tumor growth in mouse models of HCC ( Lo et al., 2016 41. Lo, J. ∙ Lau, E.Y.T. ∙ So, F.T.Y. ... Anti-CD47 antibody suppresses tumour growth and augments the effect of chemotherapy treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma Liver Int. 2016; 36 :737-745 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiao et al., 2015 79. Xiao, Z. ∙ Chung, H. ∙ Banan, B. ... Antibody mediated therapy targeting CD47 inhibits tumor progression of hepatocellular carcinoma Cancer Lett. 2015; 360 :302-309 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results suggest that different therapeutic approaches are required to treat primary or relapsed HCC, and anti-CD47-based therapies might represent a feasible prophylactic option for the early recurrence of HCC, whereas the combination of multiple ICBs could be beneficial for a larger HCC population.
In conclusion, this study provides evidence of the tumor ecosystem heterogeneity between primary and early-relapse HCC, in terms of immune and tumor phenotypes, T cell developmental trajectories, TCR clonality, and unique signatures, in addition to the crosstalk between tumor and immune cells. Our data can be a valuable resource, facilitating a deeper understanding of the mechanisms associated with early recurrence and assisting in developing more effective therapeutic targets and biomarkers for immunotherapies in HCC patients.

A total of 69 patients were pathologically diagnosed with HCC at Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University and were enrolled in this study. Paired, fresh tumor (2 × 2 × 1 cm) and adjacent normal tissue samples (at least 2 cm from matched tumor tissues) were collected as the Discovery cohort, from 18 treated naive primary or early-relapse HCC patients, detailed clinical and pathological information including age, gender, tumor size, prognosis et al. shown in Table S1 . Frozen tumor tissues or fresh cell suspensions from pairwise primary and relapsed tumor samples were collected from 4 patients as Validation cohort 1. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks of pairwise primary and early relapsed tumors were collected from 47 patients as Validation cohort 2. The available clinical features of Validation cohorts are summarized in Table S7 . All patients gave informed consent for collection of clinical information, tissue collection, research testing under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocols (B2017-159R and B2019-060R) at Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University.
Fresh tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples were surgically removed from patients and immersed in a complete medium containing 90% Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM; Cat# 11054001, GIBCO) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cat# 16140071, GIBCO), and transported to the lab in a refrigerated container. Suitable small tissue blocks (no necrotic foci / no hemorrhagic foci / less fibrous connective tissue) were cut into pieces (diameter 1-3 mm). The pieces were transferred to the gentle MACS C Tubes (Cat# 130-096-334, Miltenyi Biotec), with 5 mL of digestive enzyme included in Tumor Dissociation Kit (Cat# 130-095-929, MiltenyiBiotec). Then the tissues were made into single-cell suspension using the gentleMACS Dissociator (Cat# 130-093-235, MiltenyiBiotec) following these steps: milled; incubated at 37°C for 30 min on a shaker; milled; incubated at 37°C for 30 min; milled; filtered through a 70 μm filter, plus 2% FBS. Finally, the single-cell suspension was centrifugated at 400 g for 7 mins, resuspended in CELLSAVING (Cat# C40050, NCM biotech), cryopreserved in Cryotubes (Cat# 430488, Corning) and then stored at −80°C.
For the paired Validation Cohort 1, single-cell or single-nucleus (sn) were used for scRNA-seq or snRNA-seq. The preparation of single-cell suspension was the same as described in last paragraph. Single-nucleus were prepared as following: frozen tumor tissue pieces were placed in 1 mL Homogenization Buffer (pre-chilled) containing 10mM Tris pH 8.0 (Cat# AM9856, Ambion), 250 mM sucrose (Cat# V900116-500G, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 mM KCl (Cat# AM9640G, Ambion), 5 mM MgCl 2 (Cat# AM9530G, Ambion), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Cat# C102301, Sangon Biotech), 0.1% NP-40 (Cat# 11754599001, Roche), 0.2U/ul RNasin Plus (Cat# N2611, Promega), 1 × protease inhibitor (Cat# G6521, Promega), and 0.1mM DTT (Cat# 707265ML, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 2 mL dounce homogenizer (Cat# D8938, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes. The tissue was then homogenized by 10 strokes of the loose pestle and 10 strokes of the tight pestle. The Dounce homogenizer was submerged in ice during the grinding step. 1ml Homogenization Buffer was added to the Dounce homogenizer then the homogenate was passed through 40 μm cell strainer (Cat# 43-10040-70, Miltenyi Biotec) into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuged at 300 g × for 5 mins. Sediment was resuspended in 1.5 mL Blocking Buffer containing 1 × phosphate buffer saline (PBS; Cat# 10010049, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% filtered sterilized BSA, and 0.2U/μl Rnasin Plus by pipetting up and down gently on ice and centrifuged at 300 g × for 5 mins. The previous step was repeated once. Nuclei were resuspended in 0.04% BSA of PBS then stained by 4′-6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Cat# D9542, Sigma-Aldrich) for counting and diluted in an appropriate concentration.
The cryopreserved single-cell suspension was incubated in a 37°C water bath for rapid recovery and washed twice with 1 × PBS. Then the single-cell suspension was stained with antibodies against CD45 (Cat# 555485, BD) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA; Cat# F1303, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for FACS sorting. Single living immune cells (CD45 + , FDA + ) and non-immune cells (CD45 - , FDA + ) were obtained after FACS ( Figure S1 B). Then full-length single-cell RNA preparation in microwell was performed using MIRALCS ( Wu et al., 2015 78. Wu, L. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Zhao, Z. ... Full-length single-cell RNA-seq applied to a viral human cancer: applications to HPV expression and splicing analysis in HeLa S3 cells Gigascience. 2015; 4 :51 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), a modified microwell-based SMART-seq2 ( Picelli et al., 2014 53. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, Å.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (2437) PubMed Google Scholar ) method. Brifely, using the following steps to prepare cDNA products: dispensing lysis buffer and single-cell into 5,184 microwell chip, cell lysis, reverse transcription, cDNA amplification and identify single-cell wells based on qPCR results, product extraction, fragmentation and PCR, and then cyclized into ssDNA libraries. Each single-cell library was labeled with a barcode in the PCR step, and then was sequenced on a BGISEQ500 sequencer with 100-bp single-end reads.
For Validation cohort 1, single-cell or single-nucleus transcriptome amplifications,cDNA libraries and TCR VDJ libraries were prepared using 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5′ Library Construction Kit (Cat# 1000020, 10x Genomics) and Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cell (Cat# 1000005, 10x Genomics) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, these steps include cDNA amplification reaction, enrichment of the TCR VDJ fragment twice from the cDNA product and the library construction of cDNA or TCR VDJ. Finally, the libraries were cyclized into ssDNA libraries by MGIEasy Circularization Kit (Cat# 1000005259, MGI). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the BGISEQ500 sequencer with 8+26+100-bp pair-end reads and the TCR VDJ libraries were sequenced on the BGISEQ500 sequencer with 8+150+150-bp pair-end reads.
Genomic DNA and RNA of tissue samples were extracted using the QIAamp AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 80204, QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s specifications including the steps of DNA/RNA adsorption, purification, and collection in columns. The concentrations of DNA were quantified using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Cat# Q32850, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the quality of the DNA was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The exome libraries were constructed using the MGIEasy Exome Universal Library Prep Set (Cat# 1000009657, MGI) according to the instructions. In brief, DNA is fragmented, followed by the steps of adaptor ligation at both ends and PCR amplification. Samples were sequenced on a BGISEQ500 sequencer with 100-bp paired-end reads. In addition, multiplex PCR was designed to amplify CDR3 regions of the rearranged TCR β chain (TRB) from genomic DNA. The assay utilized a suite of 32 TRB-V primers that were each specific for a functional VB segment and 13 TRB-J primers for the JB segment ( Zhang et al., 2015 85. Zhang, W. ∙ Du, Y. ∙ Su, Z. ... IMonitor: A Robust Pipeline for TCR and BCR Repertoire Analysis Genetics. 2015; 201 :459-472 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). The enriched TRB products were cyclized into ssDNA libraries by MGIeasy Circularization Kit, and then were sequenced on the BGISEQ500 sequencer with 100+10-bp single-end reads.
For Validation Cohort 2, genomic DNA and total RNA were simultaneously extracted from FFPE slides by means of the Allprep DNA/RNA FFPE extraction kit (Cat# 80234, QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including the steps of DNA/RNA adsorption, purification, and collection in columns. After purification, DNA and RNA were eluted in 30 μL of nuclease-free water, and yield was determined by the Qubit RNA HS Assay (Cat# Q32855, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A predefined yield of 100 ng of RNA was used as acceptance criteria to ensure adequate library preparation. RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kit (Cat# RS-301-2001, Illumina) per manufacturer’s recommendations. After library quality and quantity assessment, barcoded libraries were pooled and sequenced by an Illumina Hiseq X Ten instrument (pair-end 150 cycle reactions).
FFPE tissue blocks from 47 patients (Validation cohort 2) who had undergone resection for recurrent HCC were used for IHC staining. Paired primary and relapsed samples were used for double staining of CD1C (Cat# TA505384, Origene) and IDO (Cat# 86630, CST) antibodies, staining of CD45 (Cat# 13917, CST) antibody, and double staining of CD8 (Cat# ab17147, Abcam) and CD161 (Cat# ab197979, Abcam) antibodies. All the staining process was carried out on the IHC/ISH System (BenchMark GX, Roche) following the manufacturer’s instruction.
Single stained cells were counted using a computerized image analysis system (Image-pro plus 6.0, Media Cybernetics Inc.) on the basis of pictures taken under the microscopic fields of 200 × magnification. Double staining samples were evaluated manually under microscopic fields of 1000 × magnification (oil immersion lens). To ensure representativeness and homogeneity, the whole dots were observed in tissue microarray, and 5 fields of immune cell highly infiltrated tumor area were selected in the FFPE block slide. All the evaluation was performed by the same pathologist blinded to patient characteristics.
Single-cell suspension were obtained from the fresh resection tumor tissue of HCC patient using the protocol described in single-cell isolation section above. Half of the fresh single-cell suspension was processed by Tumor Cell Isolation Kit (Cat# 130-108-339, Miltenyi Biotec) to separate untouched tumor cells, following manufacturer’s protocol. The rest of single-cell suspension was used for sorting CD8 + T cell by CD8 Microbeads (Cat# 130-045-201, Miltenyi Biotec). RPMI 1640 (Cat# 22400089, GIBCO) was used for cell culture. For each patient, both homogenized HCC cells and infiltrating CD8 + T cells were seeded at the concentration of 2 × 10 5 cells/mL in the round bottom 96-well plates in triplicate. Then 2 μL/mL of CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator (Cat# 10971, STEMCELLL) was added immediately after seeding. After coculturing for 18 h at 37°C, cells were stimulated with Golgi plug (Cat# 555029, BD Biosciences) protein transport inhibitors for another 6 h in the cell incubator. The 96-well plates were centrifugated at 250 g for 5 mins and the supernatant was discarded. Cells were then resuspended with staining media containing PE-CD8a (Cat# 300908, BioLegend) and APC/Cy7-CD161 (Cat# 339928, BioLegend) antibodies and incubated for 30 mins at room temperature. Cells were washed by staining buffer and pelleted by centrifugation. After using Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (Cat# 554714, BD Biosciences), the thoroughly fixed/permeabilized cells were stained by FITC-Granzyme B (Cat# 372206, BioLegend) antibody in perm/wash buffer at 4°C for 30 mins. Cells were washed and responded in the staining buffer before flow cytometric analysis. Multiparameter FACS data were acquired on the BD FACSAria II instrument (BD Biosciences). After gating of lymphocytes according to FSC and SSC, CD161 + CD8 + T cell (APC/Cy7 + PE + ) and CD161 - CD8 + T cells (APC/Cy7 - PE + ) were identified ( Figure 5 F). The proportions of Granzyme B positive (FITC + ) cells were further calculated. The presented data of each sample was the average of three replicates.
Multiplex staining of FFPE tissue was performed using PANO 7-plex IHC kit (Cat# 0004100100, Panovue) according to manufacturer’s instruction. IDO (Cat# 86630, CST), CD45 (Cat# BX00087, Biolynx), PD-L1 (Cat# 13684, CST), CD80 (Cat# MAB140, R&D Systems) and CD1C (Cat# TA505384, Origene) antibodies were sequentially applied, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubation and tyramide signal amplification. The slides were microwave heat-treated after each tyramide signal amplification operation. Nuclei were stained with DAPI after all the antigens above had been labeled. The stained slides were scanned to obtain multispectral images using the Mantra System (PerkinElmer), which captures the fluorescent spectra at 20-nm wavelength intervals from 420 to 720 nm with identical exposure time. For each slide, 5 fields of immune cell enriched tumoral area were selected for image capture. The selected field were scanned to obtain multispectral images using the Mantra System, which captures the fluorescent spectra at 20-nm wavelength intervals from 420 to 720 nm with identical exposure time.
For full-length data (Discovery cohort), the fastq data of scRNA-seq was produced using the BGISEQ500 with SE100 mode. First, the reads with the adaptor or poly-A sequences were removed from the raw fastq data before alignment using SOAPnuke (v1.5.6) ( Chen et al., 2018c 14. Chen, Y. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Shi, C. ... SOAPnuke: a MapReduce acceleration-supported software for integrated quality control and preprocessing of high-throughput sequencing data Gigascience. 2018; 7 :1-6 Crossref Scopus (626) Google Scholar ). The low-quality reads with “N” bases rate > 0.05 and low-quality (quality < 5) base rate accounting for 50% of the read length were also removed. Second, clean reads were aligned to the Ensembl GRCh38 using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 36. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (32371) PubMed Google Scholar ) with setting parameters “-q -phred33 -sensitive -dpad 0 -gbar 99999999 -mp 1,1 -np 1 -score-min L,0,-0.1.” We used RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization) ( Li and Dewey, 2011 39. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13406) PubMed Google Scholar ) to count the number of uniquely mapped read pairs for each gene and then gene expression was quantified by calculating the TPM (transcripts per million) value. Bulk RNA-seq data was processed using the same pipeline as scRNA-seq data.
We defined genes with TPM > 1 as detected genes. To filter out low-quality cells we set the following criterion: 1). Mapping reads ≥ 1 M; 2). Mapping rate ≥ 30%; 3). 1,500 ≤ detected genes number ≤ 10,000. In total, 16,498 cells were selected for further analysis.
For the Validation cohort 1 of 4 pairs PT and RT patients, single-cell data were generated by 10x Genomics by applying Cell Ranger (version 3.0.1, 10x Genomics) that processes Chromium single-cell RNA-seq outputs to align reads and generate the feature-barcode unique molecular identifier (UMI) matrices based on the human reference genome GRCh38.
Low-quality sequencing reads were removed from bulk exome sequencing data using fastp ( Chen et al., 2018b 13. Chen, S. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Chen, Y. ... fastp: an ultra-fast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :i884-i890 Crossref Scopus (9505) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. The remained high-quality reads were aligned to the human genome build 19 (hg19) by MegaBOLT (V1.5.3.11) ( Sun et al., 2020 67. Sun, Y. ∙ Liu, F. ∙ Fan, C. ... Characterizing sensitivity and coverage of clinical WGS as a diagnostic test for genetic disorders bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ) with parameters “-type allnoindex -interval_padding 0 -stand_call_conf 30 -knownSites $cosmic_v86.hg19.vcf.gz -vcf $dbsnp_151.hg19.vcf.gz. This step performed alignment, sorting sequences, making duplicates, base quality score recalibration (BQSR) and SNP detection.-Genome Analysis Toolkits (GATK, V3.8.1) ( McKenna et al., 2010 44. McKenna, A. ∙ Hanna, M. ∙ Banks, E. ... The Genome Analysis Toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data Genome Res. 2010; 20 :1297-1303 Crossref Scopus (17476) PubMed Google Scholar ) VariantFiltration was used to apply filtering criteria to the remaining variants with parameters “–filterExpression ‘QD < 2.0 || MQ < 40.0 || ReadPosRankSum < −8.0 || FS > 60.0’” for germline variants calling. a Quality of depth (QD) of 2 and Fisher strand score (FS) of 60 for SNV calling, 200 for INDEL calling. The generated Variant Call Forma (VCF) files were filtered by the target region of the xGen Exome Research Panel and annotated by ANNOVAR (version Feb 2016) ( Wang et al., 2010 75. Wang, K. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Hakonarson, H. ANNOVAR: functional annotation of genetic variants from high-throughput sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :e164 Crossref Scopus (9401) PubMed Google Scholar ) to predict the functional consequences of the discovered variants, as well as for obtaining allele frequencies from dbSNP 151 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ) and the 1000 Genomes project ( https://www.internationalgenome.org/ ).
Somatic mutations were detected by comparison of each tumor to the corresponding germline DNA represented by adjacent tissue. Somatic SNVs were detected by Mutect2 (imbedded in GATK) with default parameters.
For single-cell SNPs calling, sorted BAM files were used to perform reads group (RG) tagging and duplicate reads marking using Picard. Then, variants were called by using GATK according to the suggested best practice following Split’N’Trim, base recalibration, variant calling, and variant filtering.
To identify malignant cells with clonal large-scale chromosomal copy number variations, we used the inferCNV R package ( Patel et al., 2014 50. Patel, A.P. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Trombetta, J.J. ... Single-cell RNA-seq highlights intratumoral heterogeneity in primary glioblastoma Science. 2014; 344 :1396-1401 Crossref Scopus (3029) PubMed Google Scholar ) to infer the genetic profiles of each cell based on the average expression of large genes sets (101 genes) in each chromosomal region of the tumor genome compared to normal cells. All hepatic-like cells were input as interrogation group and other cells from each patient were sampled randomly as control. Other parameters were set as default.
The CCF of individual somatic variants were estimated using R package ABSOLUTE (v1.0.6) ( Carter et al., 2012 8. Carter, S.L. ∙ Cibulskis, K. ∙ Helman, E. ... Absolute quantification of somatic DNA alterations in human cancer Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :413-421 Crossref Scopus (1406) PubMed Google Scholar ), which also estimates the sample purity, ploidy, and absolute allelic copy number of each mutation. Phylogenetic analysis between primary and relapsed tumor samples from the same patient, subclonal reconstruction and tree building were performed with the PhylogicNDT package using patterns of shared mutations and CCFs with parameters “Cluster -i Patient_s -sif $somatic_variant.sif_input.sif -ni 100–order_by_time point -rb” ( Leshchiner et al., 2018 38. Leshchiner, I. ∙ Livitz, D. ∙ Gainor, J.F. ... Comprehensive analysis of tumour initiation, spatial and temporal progression under multiple lines of treatment bioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
We used the Seurat R package (v2.4.3) ( Satija et al., 2015 61. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (3012) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform unsupervised clustering of the single cells using the reads count matrix as input. First, the read counts for each cell were divided by the total counts for that cell and multiplied by the scale factor (10,000), and then natural-log transformed. To avoid unexpected noise, we only kept protein-coding genes and genes detected in less than 10 cells were excluded for downstream analysis. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the normalized expression matrix using highly variable genes identified by “FindVariableGenes” function. Following the results of PCA, the appropriate principal components (PCs) were selected for clustering with the specific resolution parameters (see below). Finally, to detect cluster-specific expressed genes, the clusters were compared pairwise using the Seurat “FindAllMarkers” function to test genes with > 0.25-fold difference (log-scale) on average between the two groups of cells and detectable expression in more than 50% of cells in either of the two populations.
For the clustering of all cells, the top 20 PCs were selected with a resolution parameter equal to 0.8. For the clustering of T lymphocytes, the top 12 PCs were selected with a resolution parameter equal to 0.8. For the clustering of myeloid cells, the top 16 PCs were selected with a resolution parameter equal to 0.6.
To define feature genes in CD8 T cells from RT, differential expression analysis between CD8 + T cells from PT and RT was carried out using “FindMarkers” function, implemented in the Seurat package, with log-scaled fold change ≥ 0.25 and P value < 0.05 (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Differentially expressed genes passing the criteria were show in Table S4 .
We used the TraCeR ( Stubbington et al., 2016 65. Stubbington, M.J.T. ∙ Lönnberg, T. ∙ Proserpio, V. ... T cell fate and clonality inference from single-cell transcriptomes Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :329-332 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ) method to assemble the TCR sequences for each single cell. TraCeR can identify the rearranged TCR chains and uses kallisto to calculate their TPM values. For every single cell, we rearranged its productive TCR chains by their TPM values. For example, if two TCRα chains were assembled in one single cell and they were both productive, the chain with the higher TPM was defined as TCRα1 while the chain with the lower TPM as TCR α2. Non-productive TCR chains were excluded. The same rearrangement analysis was deployed on TCRβ. We kept cells with at least one productive TCR α or TCR β chain for subsequent analysis. For cells with only one TCR α and one β chain, cells with identical TCR α or β chains were defined as a T cell clone. Meanwhile, for cells with paired TCR α and β chains, cells shared at least one pair of identical TCR α and β chains were defined as one clone, while identical paired TCR α and β chains which were shared by three or more cells were defined as an expanded clone.
The droplet-based TCR-seq data of P34 was processed using Cell Ranger (version 3.0.1, 10x Genomics) against the human GRCh38 vdj reference provided by 10x Genomics. We identified T cell clonotype shared by both PT and RT CD8 + T cells with the same TCR α and β CDR3 sequences.
The bulk TCR sequencing data were analyzed using TCR and BCR repertoire analyzing pipeline iMonitor ( Zhang et al., 2015 85. Zhang, W. ∙ Du, Y. ∙ Su, Z. ... IMonitor: A Robust Pipeline for TCR and BCR Repertoire Analysis Genetics. 2015; 201 :459-472 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, basic quality control is performed to discard low-quality reads and clean paired-end reads were merged by their overlapping nucleotides. Second, the merge reads were assigned to VDJ germline segments and alleles from IMGT ( http://www.imgt.org/ ) database by BLAST alignment and further re-alignment. Third, sequencing error was corrected. Then we compared clonotypes between adjacent normal tissue and tumor by calculating the top 10 abundant clonotypes sharing the same CDR3 of normal or tumor tissues.
The cell lineage trajectory of CD8 + T was inferred by using Monocle2 ( Qiu et al., 2017 56. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (1958) PubMed Google Scholar ). We excluded MAIT cells according to their TCR identity due to their distinct TCRs and development processes relative to other CD8 + cells. We first used the “relative2abs” function in Monocle2 to convert TPM into normalized mRNA counts and created an object with parameter “expressionFamily = negbinomial.size” following the Monocle2 tutorial. We used the “differentialGeneTest” function to derive DEG from each cluster and genes with a q-value < 1e-5 were used to order the cells in pseudotime analysis. After the cell trajectories were constructed, differentially expressed genes along the pseudotime were detected using the “differentialGeneTest” function.
We used the average expression (measured by log2 (TPM + 1) of 5 resident markers ( RUNX3 , NR4A1 , CD69 , CXCR6 , and NR4A3 ), 7 cytotoxicity associated genes ( PRF1 , IFNG , GNLY , NKG7 , GZMB , GZMA , CST7 , and TNFSF10 ), 5 exhausted markers ( CTLA4 , HAVCR2 , LAG3 , PDCD1 , and TIGIT ) and 6 costimulatory molecular genes ( ICOS , CD226 , TNFRSF14 , TNFRSF25 , TNFRSF9 , and CD28 ) to define the resident, cytotoxic, exhausted, and costimulatory score for CD8 T cells.
To assign M1/M2 polarization and pro-/anti-inflammatory ability estimates to macrophage cells, we applied Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) ( Hänzelmann et al., 2013 26. Hänzelmann, S. ∙ Castelo, R. ∙ Guinney, J. GSVA: gene set variation analysis for microarray and RNA-seq data BMC Bioinformatics. 2013; 14 :7 Crossref Scopus (6848) PubMed Google Scholar ) using standard settings, as implemented in the GSVA package. The gene sets associated with the above functions were described by Azizi et al. (2018) 4. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1121) PubMed Google Scholar ( Table S3 ).
To define metabolism phenotypes in CD8 + T cells in PT and RT, the metabolism signature determined as the mean expression of gene signatures involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle, lipolysis, lipogenesis, and glutamine metabolism obtained from PathCards ( https://pathcards.genecards.org/ ).
The features of malignant cells were defined with the mean log2 (TPM + 1) normalized expression of hepatic, proliferation, immune surveillance, or immune escape genes ( Table S3 ).
To investigate biological states or function differences of cells from primary/relapsed tumor, the DEGs between primary/relapsed malignant cells were used to investigate Hallmark gene sets by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 66. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (32335) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mootha et al., 2003 45. Mootha, V.K. ∙ Lindgren, C.M. ∙ Eriksson, K.F. ... PGC-1α-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes Nat. Genet. 2003; 34 :267-273 Crossref Scopus (7012) PubMed Google Scholar ). The phase gene sets of CD8 T cell trajectory were enriched with the Hallmark gene sets and Reactome pathway by GSEA. Pathway enrichment analysis for DEG between CD8 cells from PT and RT, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed to characterize the biological functions of cells. The differentially expressed genes between different cell types were uploaded into the IPA software for the core analysis, and identified the canonical pathways, diseases and functions, upstream regulators, and gene networks.
For IHC samples, we analyzed the association of CD8 + CD161 + T cell number and second relapse in RT cohort. The samples were grouped into high and low groups based on the optimal cutpoint determined by R function surv_cutpoint. Kaplan–Meier survival curves with the cumulative number of events table and the cumulative number of censored subjects table were plotted by survminer package.
In the bulk Validation cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Liver Cancer (LIHC) data, the RT KLBR1 hi T cell signature was defined as the mean log 2 (TPM + 1) normalized expression of feature genes and divided by the expression of CD8A . The KLBR1 hi CD8 T cell feature genes included KLRB1, CCL20, CCR6, IFNGR1, IL7R, EGR1, SATB1, SLC4A10, NFKBIA, GPR183, LDHA, VIM, RORA, CREM, NINJ1, NCR3, TWISTNB, REL, TTC39C, CA2, G3BP2, NFKB1, EIF4A3, FTH1, GPR65, SKIL, THBS1, CD83, SQSTM1, TRMO, GNG2, JCHAIN, ADAM19, ATP1B3, PDCD4, ANXA1, BEST1, FOS, STAT4, IL4I1, ODF2L, FKBP11, TC2N, TNFAIP3, KDM6B, INSIG1, SPOCK2, GLIPR1, BIRC3 and YPEL5. For the bulk validation cohort 2, the survival analysis was performed using survminer package. The TCGA LIHC gene expression and survival data were downloaded from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena ( http://xena.ucsc.edu/ ). The samples were grouped into high and low expression groups by the median value. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted to show differences in survival time, and log-rank p values reported by the Cox regression models implemented in the R package survival were used to determine the statistical significance.
To analyze cell-cell interactions between different cell types, we used CellPhoneDB ( Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 72. Vento-Tormo, R. ∙ Efremova, M. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal-fetal interface in humans Nature. 2018; 563 :347-353 Crossref Scopus (1234) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify significant ligand-receptor pairs within primary and relapsed HCC samples. For both primary and relapsed HCC, the cell type-specific receptor-ligand interactions between cell types were identified based on the specific expression of a receptor by one cell type and a ligand by another cell type. The interaction score refers to the total mean of the individual ligand-receptor partner average expression values in the corresponding interacting pairs of cell types. The expression of any complexes output by CellPhoneDB was calculated as the sum of the expression of the component genes.
Cell distribution comparisons between two groups were performed using unpaired two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Comparisons of gene expression or gene signature between two groups of cells were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. Comparisons of cell distribution of paired RT and PT as well as tumor and ANT were performed using paired two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. All statistical analyses and presentation were performed using R. Statistical tests used in figures were shown in figure legends and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Exact value of n was shown in the figures and figure legends and what n represents was shown in the figure legends.
