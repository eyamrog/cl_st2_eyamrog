Title: Enhanced safety and efficacy of protease-regulated CAR-T cell receptors


Abstract: Summary

Regulatable CAR platforms could circumvent toxicities associated with CAR-T therapy, but existing systems have shortcomings including leakiness and attenuated activity. Here, we present SNIP CARs, a protease-based platform for regulating CAR activity using an FDA-approved small molecule. Design iterations yielded CAR-T cells that manifest full functional capacity with drug and no leaky activity in the absence of drug. In numerous models, SNIP CAR-T cells were more potent than constitutive CAR-T cells and showed diminished T cell exhaustion and greater stemness. In a ROR1-based CAR lethality model, drug cessation following toxicity onset reversed toxicity, thereby credentialing the platform as a safety switch. In the same model, reduced drug dosing opened a therapeutic window that resulted in tumor eradication in the absence of toxicity. SNIP CARs enable remote tuning of CAR activity, which provides solutions to safety and efficacy barriers that are currently limiting progress in using CAR-T cells to treat solid tumors.

Moreover, CAR-T cell therapy in solid tumors has yielded only limited success. This relates in part to challenges posed by a lack of tumor-specific cell surface antigens and shared expression of candidate solid tumor targets on vital normal tissues, which heightens the risk of on-target off-tumor toxicity ( Gross and Eshhar, 2016 29.

Although these strategies may prove useful in amplifying the antitumor response, they may also increase risk of toxicity, highlighting the need for next-generation CAR systems with built-in safety features. Suicide switches may diminish risk but abrogate the potential for antitumor effects, and in some settings, they are inefficient ( Diaconu et al., 2017 17. Diaconu, I. ∙ Ballard, B. ∙ Zhang, M. ...

CAR-T cells are self-amplifying and demonstrate high patient-to-patient variability in expansion and activity ( Milone and Bhoj, 2018 64. Milone, M.C. ∙ Bhoj, V.G.

Tisagenlecleucel model-based cellular kinetic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor–T cells CPT Pharmacometrics Syst. Pharmacol. 2019; 8 :285-295 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, constitutive CAR-T cell platforms provide limited opportunity to control dosing and activity of these potent immune effectors following the onset of toxicity. Traditional drugs such as small molecules have well-defined pharmacokinetics (PKs), and dosing can be individually tuned to provide a therapeutic window (TW). Drug-regulatable CAR platforms, whereby the activity of CAR-T cells is conditional and can be controlled remotely by an administered drug, provide a potentially attractive safety feature for controlling CAR-T functionality without permanently ablating the cells. Such platforms could also potentially allow tuning of the activity of the CAR-T cells to avoid toxicity. However, previously reported drug-regulatable systems have been limited by poor dynamic range, residual “leaky” activity in the OFF state, reduced expression of CAR on the cell surface, the use of immunosuppressive drugs for CAR control, and/or diminished potency compared with constitutive CARs ( Giordano-Attianese et al., 2020 27.

Here, we report the engineering and development of a high-performance drug-regulatable system termed signal neutralization by an inhibitable protease (SNIP) that is regulated by an FDA-approved small molecule with favorable PK in humans. The platform has no leaky activity and outperforms constitutive CARs in multiple orthotopic solid tumor models. We show that SNIP CAR-T cells provide a reliable safety switch since lethal toxicity can be prevented by stopping drug following the onset of toxicity. SNIP CAR-T cells also demonstrate enhanced efficacy in numerous models associated with more functional, less exhausted, and higher levels of memory CAR-T cells than those treated with constitutive CAR-T cells. Further, in an on-target off-tumor toxicity mouse model, reduced drug dosing tunes SNIP CAR-T cells to fall within a TW that clears tumor cells expressing high levels of antigen while sparing healthy tissue expressing lower levels of the antigen.

Section: Results

We sought to develop a high-performance CAR platform regulated by an FDA-approved small molecule. Building on promising results using hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease (NS3p) and protease inhibitors to regulate diverse proteins ( Chung et al., 2015 12. Chung, H.K. ∙ Jacobs, C.L. ∙ Huo, Y. ...

Chemogenetic control of gene expression and cell signaling with antiviral drugs Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :519-522 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), we sought to coexpress NS3p and an NS3p cleavage site (CS) between CAR functional domains and thereby cleave CARs at baseline rendering them inactive (OFF state). Exposure to grazoprevir (GPV), an NS3p inhibitor, would prevent cleavage and retain the functional CAR (ON state). We first integrated the CS and protease between the CD8α transmembrane (Tm) and intracellular signaling domains (4-1BB.CD3ζ) in a B7H3-targeting CAR ( Figure 1 A [left]; cis SNIP BBz) ( Majzner et al., 2019 60. Majzner, R.G. ∙ Theruvath, J.L. ∙ Nellan, A. ... CAR T cells targeting B7-H3, a pan-cancer antigen, demonstrate potent preclinical activity against pediatric solid tumors and brain tumors Clin. Cancer Res. 2019; 25 :2560-2574 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ), which endowed robust GPV-regulated control of CAR cleavage in primary human T cells, but no detectable antitumor activity and reduced surface expression in the ON state ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). Next, the CS and NS3p were integrated between the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and the CD8α Tm domain ( Figure 1 B [left]; cis SNIP scFv), yielding proteolytic control of the CAR with a wide dynamic range ( Figures 1 B [middle] and S1 B) but diminished antitumor activity in the ON state, potentially due to perturbation of the optimal spacer length between CAR-antigen interactions in the immunological synapse ( Figure 1 B [right]; Guest et al., 2005 30. Guest, R.D. ∙ Hawkins, R.E. ∙ Kirillova, N. ... The role of extracellular spacer regions in the optimal design of chimeric immune receptors: evaluation of four different scFvs and antigens J.

Receptor affinity and extracellular domain modifications affect tumor recognition by ROR1-specific chimeric antigen receptor T cells Clin. Cancer Res. 2013; 19 :3153-3164 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In the third design, we minimized modification to the CAR by incorporating only a CS between the Tm and signaling domains and delivering a membrane-bound NS3p in trans with a CD28 Tm ( Figure 1 C [left]; trans SNIP BBz). T cells expressing the trans SNIP B7H3 CAR manifested high cytotoxic activity in the ON state, similar to a constitutive B7H3.BBz CAR ( Figure 1 C [right]). However, significant leaky activity was observed in the OFF state, likely due to incomplete CAR cleavage at baseline. We next constructed trans SNIP systems with various combinations of CD8α or CD28 Tm domains ( Figure 1 D [left]) and found that matched CD8α or CD28 Tm domains (i.e., 8/8 and 28/28, CAR Tm/protease Tm) yielded more complete SNIP CAR cleavage compared with mismatched Tm configurations ( Figure S1 C). Further, a matched Tm design reduced residual leaky activity in the OFF state ( Figures 1 D [middle] and S1 C), likely due to homodimerization enhancing proximity of the protease to the cut site ( Fujiwara et al., 2020 26. Fujiwara, K. ∙ Tsunei, A. ∙ Kusabuka, H. ...

Chem. 1993; 268 :26607-26612 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression of membrane-bound protease in the SNIP system did not compromise CAR expression ( Figure S1 D). The 8/8 Tm version had a wide dynamic range of control ( Figure 1 E) and an unperturbed surface expression ( Figures S1 D and S1E) and mediated more potent antitumor activity than the 28/28 TM in the ON state ( Figure 1 D [right]). We used the trans SNIP architecture to generate SNIP CARs for other tumor antigens by swapping out the scFv domain. For the remainder of this report, all 4-1BB costimulated SNIP CARs are in the 8/8 configuration, and all CD28 costimulated SNIP CARs are in the 28/28 configuration.
We stimulated SNIP B7H3 CAR-T cells with 143B osteosarcoma cells and various GPV concentrations and observed a dose-responsive relationship between GPV and IFNγ and IL-2 secretion ( Figure 1 F), with a GPV EC50 for IFNγ of 4.3 ± 1.4 nM and for IL-2 of 6.8 ± 1.3 nM, below the 24 h postdose concentration (C 24 ) achieved with 100 mg GPV dosing regimens in humans ( Caro et al., 2017 8.

Agents Chemother. 2017; 61 :e00813 e00817 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cytokine secretion by SNIP B7H3 CAR-T cells displayed rapid ON and OFF kinetics ( Figures 1 G and S1 F), and strikingly, SNIP B7H3 CAR-T cells secreted more IL-2 than B7H3.BBz CAR-T cells when preincubated with GPV for short periods (<24 h) ( Figure 1 G); however, prolonged exposure to GPV led to a progressive drop off in IL-2 secretion reaching similar levels as constitutive B7H3.BBz CARs by 39 h, likely from tonic CAR signaling in the ON state that limits effector capacity ( Long et al., 2015 52.

Transient “rest” induces functional reinvigoration and epigenetic remodeling in exhausted CAR-T cells Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We previously found that IL-2 secretion serves as a good discriminator of CAR-T efficacy ( Spiegel et al., 2021 98. Spiegel, J.Y. ∙ Patel, S. ∙ Muffly, L. ... CAR T cells with dual targeting of CD19 and CD22 in adult patients with recurrent or refractory B cell malignancies: a phase 1 trial Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1419-1431 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). SNIP B7H3 cytotoxicity could also be controlled in vivo , as bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of Nalm6-B7H3 leukemia cells revealed clearance of tumor in the GPV-treated SNIP ON group, but not in the SNIP OFF group ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
To assess activity of SNIP B7H3 CAR-T cells in vivo against a solid tumor, we engrafted MED8A medulloblastoma cells subcutaneously in the flank and the cerebellum of NSG (NOD–SCID Il2rg-null) mice simultaneously, then administered 5 × 10 6 SNIP or mock T cells. The SNIP ON group cleared the tumor, but we observed antitumor activity in the SNIP OFF group ( Figures 2 C and 2D), consistent with leakiness in the system, as previously reported with regulatable systems ( Juillerat et al., 2019 43.

Engineering AvidCARs for combinatorial antigen recognition and reversible control of CAR function Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4166 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Leakiness increased with higher antigen density ( Figures S2 A and S2B), and we hypothesized that it reflected incomplete CAR cleavage in the OFF state, which could potentially be ameliorated by enhancing formation of the protease-CS complex and catalytic turnover. Thus, we designed SNIP variants incorporating CSs with greater catalytic efficiency (cut site 2 and cut site 3) and compared them with the standard CS (cut site 1). Tumor coculture experiments confirmed that receptors incorporating catalytically enhanced SNIP cut site 3 showed no leaky activity, even against tumor lines expressing very high levels of B7H3 ( Figures 2 E and S2 A; >370,000 molecules/cell) and equivalent cytotoxic activity in the ON state ( Figure S2 C). Temporal responsiveness and wide dynamic range of the SNIP system is illustrated by undetectable full-length CAR in the absence of drug with the two efficient CSs (CS2 and CS3) and full expression of CAR in the ON state compared with a dead protease control (dNS3), even following as little as 24 h exposure to GPV ( Figure S2 D). We compared performance of the SNIP platform with a B7H3.BBz CAR regulated using destabilization domain (DD) technology, incorporating a drug-dependent dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) degron fused to the C terminus of the CAR ( Iwamoto et al., 2010 38. Iwamoto, M. ∙ Björklund, T. ∙ Lundberg, C. ... A general chemical method to regulate protein stability in the mammalian central nervous system Chem. Biol. 2010; 17 :981-988 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weber et al., 2021 115. Weber, E.W. ∙ Parker, K.R. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... Transient rest restores functionality in exhausted CAR-T cells through epigenetic remodeling Science. 2021; 372 :eaba1786 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). The B7H3.BBz DD displayed leaky residual expression in the OFF state and diminished CAR expression in the ON state (1 μM trimethoprim [TMP]), leading to a narrower dynamic range of expression compared with SNIP. Finally, we confirmed reduced leakiness in the catalytically enhanced variants, with SNIP cut site 3 displaying no detectable leaky activity in the OFF state in the MED8A in vivo model ( Figures 2 F and 2G).
We next compared efficacy of optimized SNIP CARs with constitutive CARs in orthotopic solid tumor models. NSG mice were inoculated with 1 × 10 6 CHLA255 neuroblastoma cells by renal capsule injection and were then treated with 10 × 10 6 SNIP or constitutive GD2.BBz CAR-T cells 7 days later ( Figure 3 A). The SNIP GD2 CAR-T cells rapidly cured the mice of CHLA255 tumor in the ON state, whereas constitutive GD2.BBz CAR-T cells exerted only modest antitumor activity ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Similarly, in an orthotopic MG63.3 osteosarcoma model, we observed enhanced antitumor efficacy and more rapid tumor clearance with SNIP HER2 versus constitutive HER2.BBz CAR-T cells ( Figures S3 A–S3C), results that were confirmed in the more aggressive 143B osteosarcoma model ( Figures 3 D and 3E).
To test if SNIP CAR-T cells are functional in the central nervous system (CNS) tumors, we implanted MED8A medulloblastoma in the cerebellum of NSG mice and were then treated with 3 × 10 6 SNIP or constitutive B7H3.BBz CAR-T cells ( Figure 3 F). Remarkably, SNIP B7H3.BBz CAR-T cells outperformed constitutive B7H3.BBz CAR-T cells in this difficult-to-treat CNS tumor model ( Figures 3 G, 3H, and S3 D–S3F), suggesting that adequate GPV levels may be achieved in the setting of brain tumors and/or that the kinetics of T cell trafficking between the CNS and the periphery enables sufficient SNIP ON activity, even if local GPV levels are limiting. To assess the mechanism responsible for enhanced SNIP CAR efficacy in this model, we undertook T cell imaging using an Antares bioluminescence reporter ( Chu et al., 2016 11. Chu, J. ∙ Oh, Y. ∙ Sens, A. ... A bright cyan-excitable orange fluorescent protein facilitates dual-emission microscopy and enhances bioluminescence imaging in vivo Nat.

Novel NanoLuc substrates enable bright two-population bioluminescence imaging in animals Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :852-860 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), which revealed greater persistence of SNIP ON CAR-T cells in the CNS and the periphery ( Figures S3 G–S3I) compared with the constitutive CARs. We also observed persistence of SNIP OFF CAR-T cells that could be due to homeostatic T cell expansion ( Mackall et al., 1997 55. Mackall, C.L. ∙ Hakim, F.T. ∙ Gress, R.E.

Med. 2018; 24 :572-579 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ex vivo stimulation with plate bound B7H3-Fc of CAR-T cells harvested from brains and spleens 10 days after T cell infusion demonstrated greater activation of brain infiltrating SNIP CAR-T cells, whereas constitutive B7H3 CAR-T cells had increased basal levels of activation, limited response to antigen stimulation, and increased levels of the exhaustion marker CD39 ( Figure 3 I). We also observed enhanced functionality and increased stem cell memory subsets (CD62L + CD45RA + ) of splenic SNIP versus constitutive CAR-T cells ( Figure 3 J). SNIP CD19.BBz CAR-T cells also showed equivalent antitumor efficacy against a Nalm6 leukemia model ( Figures S3 J–S3L).
To better understand the basis for the superior potency of SNIP versus constitutive CARs, we conducted mass cytometry of HER2, GD2, and B7H3.BBz SNIP versus constitutive CAR-T cells after the 10-day CAR-T cell transduction and expansion process. Constitutive CAR-T cells manifested increased levels of effector-/exhaustion-associated proteins, whereas SNIP CAR-T cells cultured in the absence of GPV (SNIP OFF)-expressed markers associated with stemness, similar to mock untransduced controls ( Figures 4 A and S4 A). Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), differential expression ( Figure S4 B), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that constitutive CARs showed a significant enrichment of genes upregulated in effector versus memory T cells ( Wherry et al., 2007 116. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Ha, S.J. ∙ Kaech, S.M. ... Molecular signature of CD8+ T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection Immunity. 2007; 27 :670-684 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1302) PubMed Google Scholar ) and associated with T cell exhaustion ( Good et al., 2021 28. Good, C.R. ∙ Aznar, M.A. ∙ Kuramitsu, S. ... An NK-like CAR T cell transition in CAR T cell dysfunction Cell. 2021; 184 :6081-6100.e26 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas SNIP CAR-T cells demonstrated increased levels of genes upregulated in nonexhausted CD19.BBz CAR-T cells ( Lynn et al., 2019 54. Lynn, R.C. ∙ Weber, E.W. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... C-Jun overexpression in CAR T cells induces exhaustion resistance Nature. 2019; 576 :293-300 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 C).
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and splenic T cells from mice engrafted with 143B osteosarcomas and treated with SNIP ON versus constitutive HER2.BBz CAR-T cells ( Figure 4 B) were compared. Splenic SNIP CAR-T cells were present at a higher frequency ( Figure 4 C), contained a larger fraction of stem cell memory subsets ( Figures 4 D and S4 D), maintained a normal CD4 + to CD8 + ratio ( Figure S4 E), and were more responsive than constitutive CAR-T cells upon antigen stimulation ex vivo ( Figures 4 E and S4 F). Similarly, TILs from SNIP CAR-T-treated mice expressed lower levels of the exhaustion marker CD39 than those treated with constitutive CAR-T cells ( Figure 4 F).
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering on TILs harvested from 143B engrafted mice ( Figures 5 A–5C) confirmed more TILs in SNIP compared with constitutive HER2.BBz-treated mice with several clusters nearly exclusively comprising SNIP CAR-T cells. Within these unique clusters were CD4 + cells that expressed genes associated with memory markers (TCF7 and IL7R) and CD8 + cells that expressed high levels of cytotoxic genes (GZMB, GNLY, and NKG7) ( Figures 5 D, 5E, and S5 A). A similar number of SNIP and constitutive CAR-T cells were in G2M and S phase; however, SNIP cells also formed a large pool in G1 phase, which was substantially lower in the constitutive group ( Figures S5 B and S5C). Together, these data demonstrate that SNIP CAR-T cells manifest diminished exhaustion features prior to adoptive transfer, undergo greater expansion following adoptive transfer, and simultaneously generate stem-like populations as well as effector subsets in vivo that mediate significantly enhanced potency against solid tumors.
To investigate whether enhanced functionality of SNIP CARs is due to a “resting” effect when cultured in the OFF state or due to specific attributes of the molecular architecture, we created a dead protease SNIP (dNS3) control by mutating the active site serine of NS3p to an alanine, which abolishes proteolytic activity ( Lai et al., 2000 48. Lai, V.C.H. ∙ Zhong, W. ∙ Skelton, A. ... Generation and characterization of a hepatitis C virus NS3 protease-dependent bovine viral diarrhea virus J. Virol. 2000; 74 :6339-6347 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). T cell phenotype and function, downstream phosphorylation, and tonic signaling of constitutive B7H3.BBz CAR, SNIP CARs exposed to GPV for short (SNIP ON 24 h) and long (SNIP ON 144 h) periods, and relevant controls were measured. SNIP B7H3 CAR-T cells grown in the absence of GPV until 24 h prior to tumor coculture (SNIP CS2 ON 24 h) displayed the fastest tumor killing kinetics ( Figure S5 D). We derived a tumor-killing kinetic parameter, T Kill50 , that is the time point at which the tumor GFP level reaches less than 50% of the initial value. On average, the rested SNIP CAR-T cells (ON 24 h) killed tumor cells ∼40% faster than conventional, dNS3, or SNIP ON 144 h CAR-T cells. These findings demonstrate enhanced functionality of SNIP cells manufactured in the OFF state and is consistent with previous work demonstrating that transient “rest” of CAR-T cells enhances their functionality through epigenetic remodeling ( Weber et al., 2021 115. Weber, E.W. ∙ Parker, K.R. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... Transient rest restores functionality in exhausted CAR-T cells through epigenetic remodeling Science. 2021; 372 :eaba1786 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) and another study demonstrating reduced tonic signaling and greater potency when the CAR was targeted to the T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) locus ( Eyquem et al., 2017 19. Eyquem, J. ∙ Mansilla-Soto, J. ∙ Giavridis, T. ... Targeting a CAR to the TRAC locus with CRISPR/Cas9 enhances tumour rejection Nature. 2017; 543 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phenotypic analysis of D10 in vitro CAR-T cells confirmed reduced exhaustion markers on SNIP OFF and mock T cells relative to controls ( Figure S5 E). We also observed a small but significant increase of CD62L + CD45RA + subsets in SNIP dNS3 and SNIP ON 144 h, compared with conventional B7H3.BBz CAR-T cells. However, the most dramatic increase was seen in the SNIP OFF and mock T cells.
Stimulation with B7H3-Fc induced similar levels of phosphorylated CAR-CD3ζ signal (pCD3ζ) for SNIP ON and constitutive groups; however, rested SNIP (ON 24 h) CAR-T cells expressed higher levels of early activation markers and phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules than nonrested and constitutive controls in response to stimulation ( Figure S5 F). Expression of activation markers and phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules induced by tonic signaling was similar across SNIP ON and constitutive controls ( Figure S5 G). GPV had no direct effect on T cell function or tumor cell proliferation ( Figure S5 H). Taken together, the phenotypic, signaling, and functional data provide evidence that cleavage of the signaling domains in the SNIP system ablates CAR tonic signaling, leading to reduced levels of exhaustion and greater stemness in the OFF state. When rested SNIP CAR-T cells are turned ON with GPV for limited periods, they have a greater capacity to transduce CAR proximal signaling into downstream pathways and faster tumor-killing kinetics than conventional, dNS3, and always ON SNIP CAR-T cells, although this effect is ablated when SNIP CARs are exposed to full dose drug for 144 h.
We next sought to test if the SNIP system could provide a safety switch in the event of CAR-mediated on-target toxicity. Previous work has shown that ROR1(R11).BBz-CAR-T cells induce lethal on-target off-tumor toxicity in NSG mice preconditioned with radiation ( Srivastava et al., 2019 99. Srivastava, S. ∙ Salter, A.I. ∙ Liggitt, D. ... Logic-gated ROR1 chimeric antigen receptor expression rescues T cell-mediated toxicity to normal tissues and enables selective tumor targeting Cancer Cell. 2019; 35 :489-503.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). To avoid potential confounding factors associated with irradiation, we constructed ROR1 CARs based on the clone F antibody (ROR1(F)) with CD28 or 4-1BB signaling domains ( Figure S6 A [top]; Nathwani et al., 2019 69. Nathwani, A. ∙ Satyen, G. ∙ Della Peruta, M. WO 2019/008378 Al - ROR1 CAR T-cells WIPO, 2019 https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2019008378 Google Scholar ). Staining of ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells with ROR1-Fc confirmed cross-reactivity to human and mouse ROR1 ( Figure S6 B). Nontumor-bearing mice treated with ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells developed severe toxicity without radiation, as indicated by rapid weight loss and death within 11 days after CAR treatment ( Figure S6 A [middle and bottom]), consistent with the strong signal strength of CD28-costimulated CARs ( Majzner et al., 2020 59. Majzner, R.G. ∙ Rietberg, S.P. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... Tuning the antigen density requirement for car T-cell activity Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :702-723 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Salter et al., 2018 86. Salter, A.I. ∙ Ivey, R.G. ∙ Kennedy, J.J. ... Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function Sci. Signal. 2018; 11 :eaat6753 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify sites of on-target off-tumor activity associated with ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cell toxicity, we constructed a T cell activation reporter by placing the highly sensitive luciferase, Antares, downstream of NF-κB response elements ( Figure 6 A; Chu et al., 2016 11. Chu, J. ∙ Oh, Y. ∙ Sens, A. ... A bright cyan-excitable orange fluorescent protein facilitates dual-emission microscopy and enhances bioluminescence imaging in vivo Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :760-767 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ; Su et al., 2020 102. Su, Y. ∙ Walker, J.R. ∙ Park, Y. ... Novel NanoLuc substrates enable bright two-population bioluminescence imaging in animals Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :852-860 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). BLI of ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells co-transduced with a constitutive firefly luciferase and the NF-κB-Antares reporter, which enabled simultaneous tracking of total and activated T cells, revealed similar total T cell signal from ROR1(F).28z and control CD19.28z CAR-T cell-treated mice ( Figure 6 B [right panel]), but activated T cells were only detected in ROR1(F).28z-treated mice ( Figure 6 B [left panel]). Ex vivo Antares BLI of organs harvested 48 h after T cell administration identified the lungs, spleen, and kidney as predominant sites of activated ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells ( Figure 6 C). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining confirmed infiltration of ROR1(F).28z T cells in the lungs, around vessels and bronchioles with accompanying perivascular edema ( Figure 6 D), and human and mouse scRNA-seq data identified the lungs as the most prominent site of ROR1 expression ( Figures S6 C and S6D), including alveolar type I cells, alveolar type II cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and mesothelial stromal cells ( Figure S6 C). Together, these data credential the ROR1(F).28z-CAR as inducing lethal on-target toxicity targeting the mouse lung and suggest that NF-κB-based reporters can potentially distinguish cognate antigen driven activation from homeostatic proliferation in vivo .
To test whether cessation of drug dosing could reverse SNIP CAR toxicity, we treated nontumor-bearing mice with 10 × 10 6 SNIP ROR1(F).28z, constitutive ROR1(F).28z, or mock T cells. SNIP groups were treated for 2 days with either 50 mg/kg GPV and 25 mg/kg ritonavir (RTV) 3× per day (SNIP ON rescue) or vehicle control (SNIP OFF) and monitored for weight loss ( Figure 6 E). Mice treated with constitutive CAR-T cells developed rapid toxicity that was lethal within 4 days after treatment ( Figure 6 F). Mice treated with SNIP and continuous high GPV dosing also developed rapid lethal toxicity ( Figure S7 A); however, cessation of GPV at day 2 reversed the toxicity, as evidenced by a rebound in weight ( Figure 6 F).
We hypothesized that bioactivity of SNIP ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells could be tuned by modulating GPV dosing to enable targeting of tumor cells expressing high levels of antigen while sparing healthy tissue with lower antigen expression. To model the impact of SNIP CAR-T tuning on antigen density thresholds in vitro , we cultured single-cell clones of Nalm6-ROR1 leukemia stably expressing various levels of surface ROR1 ( Figure S7 B) with SNIP ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells at varying GPV concentrations. We observed some antigen densities, wherein the highest dose of GPV induced plateaued cytokine production, but at lower GPV doses, we observed antigen density induced gradations in cytokine production ( Figure 7 A), consistent with GPV mediated analog tuning of antigen density thresholds that could open TWs for shared antigens ( Figure S7 C). To test this hypothesis in vivo , we inoculated mice with Nalm6-ROR1 tumor cells and then administered a reduced dosing strategy of 25 mg/kg GPV and 2.5 mg/kg RTV, given only once per day as a TW regimen (SNIP ON TW ). SNIP ROR1(F).28z mice treated with the SNIP ON TW regimen did not develop weight loss and maintained robust antitumor activity that led to complete cures and significant survival advantage ( Figures 7 B–7D). Mice treated with constitutive ROR1(F).28z had tumor regression but died shortly after T cell administration due to on-target off-tumor toxicity in the lungs and liver, which was noticeably milder in animals treated with SNIP ROR1(F).28z ON TW CAR-T cells ( Figures 7 E and S7 Di–S7Dviii).
We tested the ability of dasatinib, an inhibitor of TCR and CAR signaling, to achieve safety control in the ROR1 toxicity model ( Weber et al., 2019 114. Weber, E.W. ∙ Lynn, R.C. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... Pharmacologic control of CAR-T cell function using dasatinib Blood Adv. 2019; 3 :711-717 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 115. Weber, E.W. ∙ Parker, K.R. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... Transient rest restores functionality in exhausted CAR-T cells through epigenetic remodeling Science. 2021; 372 :eaba1786 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice treated with conventional ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells experienced 100% lethality within 8 days and treatment with 50 mg/kg dasatinib twice per day delayed toxicity and provided small but significant survival benefit; however, mice ultimately succumbed to the toxicity of the ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells. In contrast, mice treated with SNIP CAR-T cells and TW drug dosing (25 mg/kg GPV and 2.5 mg/kg RTV once per day) demonstrated antitumor activity and survival benefit, with greater antitumor activity against ROR1 Med than ROR1 Low tumor cells ( Figures S7 E and S7F). We also compared SNIP performance with the CARs incorporating a DD in this aggressive toxicity model. Immunoblotting of CD3ζ revealed a leaky expression of the DD-regulated CAR in the OFF state and diminished expression in the ON state compared with a conventional CAR control, leading to a narrower dynamic range compared with SNIP regulated CARs ( Figure S2 D). In vivo , animals receiving ROR1(F).28z DD CAR OFF experienced toxicity similar to constitutive ROR1(F).28z CAR, whereas SNIP OFF and mock-treated mice showed no signs of toxicity ( Figures S7 G and S7H). ROR1 DD-treated mice were thin, weak, hunched, scruffy, and hyperventilating, whereas the SNIP ROR1-treated mice appeared healthy ( Videos S1 and S2 ). The NF-κB-Antares reporter confirmed Antares induction in ROR1 DD OFF but not SNIP OFF CAR-T cells stimulated with ROR1+ tumor cells in vitro ( Figure S7 I) and due to on-target, off-tumor toxicity in vivo ( Figure S7 J).

SNIP ROR1 CAR-T-treated mice do not exhibit any clinical signs of toxicity in the OFF state, related to Figure 7
We utilized the HER2 143B model to mechanistically compare in vivo functionality of SNIP to two other drug-regulated systems. We rested cells using (1) a DD HER2.BBz CAR manufactured in the absence of TMP, (2) a SNIP HER2.BBz CAR manufactured in the absence of GPV, and (3) the constitutive HER2.BBz CAR manufactured with dasatinib ( Weber et al., 2021 115. Weber, E.W. ∙ Parker, K.R. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... Transient rest restores functionality in exhausted CAR-T cells through epigenetic remodeling Science. 2021; 372 :eaba1786 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Constitutive, dasatinib-rested constitutive, and dNS3-treated mice had no benefit relative to the mock control. In contrast, both SNIP- and DD HER2-treated mice dosed with GPV or TMP, respectively, had dramatically enhanced in vivo benefit ( Figures S7 K and S7L). Flow cytometry of preinfusion T cells showed an incomplete recovery of memory subsets in dasatinib-treated HER2.BBz, whereas SNIP OFF and DD OFF cells displayed a memory phenotype similar to mock T cells ( Figure S7 M), consistent with incomplete cessation of CAR signaling with dasatinib compared with the other systems. Another possible factor contributing to the differential in vivo response between the dasatinib-rested versus the SNIP/DD groups is that the latter could experience oscillatory CAR signaling arising from variability in GPV or TMP levels associated with normal PK, thereby delaying exhaustion and promoting long-term functionality.

Section: Discussion

Remarkable antitumor effects of CAR-T therapies in B cell malignancies have been offset by high rates of CRS and neurotoxicity, which can be fatal. Moreover, as the field strives to improve the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells against solid tumors, particularly with untested target antigens and with CAR-T cells engineered for enhanced potency, the risks of on-target toxicity pose a major barrier to progress. Synthetic biology could provide solutions to these challenges, but current drug-regulated platforms have limitations including leaky activity, which risks toxicity even in the OFF state, and diminished potency in the ON state, and some employ immunosuppressive drugs as regulators ( Giordano-Attianese et al., 2020 27.

Redirecting gene-modified T cells toward various cancer types using tagged antibodies Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18 :6436-6445 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, these platforms have not yet been demonstrated clinically to mitigate toxicity or enhance efficacy. Further, the majority of these platforms utilize protein-based adapters, which require significant expense and time to develop, credential, and produce for clinical use and may have limited penetration into tumor tissue and the CNS. Here, we developed SNIP, an optimized, protease-based, drug-regulated platform for remote control of CAR-T cell effector activity that demonstrates enhanced potency compared with constitutive CARs and has been engineered to be completely devoid of leaky activity.
T cell exhaustion is a major factor limiting clinical efficacy of CAR-T cells. Many CARs manifest tonic signaling during in vitro manufacturing, leading to early exhaustion that limits potency ( Eyquem et al., 2017 19. Eyquem, J. ∙ Mansilla-Soto, J. ∙ Giavridis, T. ... Targeting a CAR to the TRAC locus with CRISPR/Cas9 enhances tumour rejection Nature. 2017; 543 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ; Long et al., 2015 52.

C-Jun overexpression in CAR T cells induces exhaustion resistance Nature. 2019; 576 :293-300 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), and exposure to high tumor burdens also induces exhaustion in the absence of tonic signaling ( Long et al., 2015 52. Long, A.H. ∙ Haso, W.M. ∙ Shern, J.F. ... 4-1BB costimulation ameliorates T cell exhaustion induced by tonic signaling of chimeric antigen receptors Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :581-590 Crossref Scopus (824) PubMed Google Scholar ). We have previously demonstrated that transient cessation of CAR signaling can enhance functionality by preventing and reversing hallmark phenotypic, functional, transcriptomic, and epigenetic feature of exhaustion ( Weber et al., 2021 115. Weber, E.W. ∙ Parker, K.R. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... Transient rest restores functionality in exhausted CAR-T cells through epigenetic remodeling Science. 2021; 372 :eaba1786 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Eyquem et al. previously demonstrated that targeting a CAR to the TRAC locus resulted in optimal expression kinetics, reduced tonic signaling, and greater antitumor efficacy ( Eyquem et al., 2017 19. Eyquem, J. ∙ Mansilla-Soto, J. ∙ Giavridis, T. ... Targeting a CAR to the TRAC locus with CRISPR/Cas9 enhances tumour rejection Nature. 2017; 543 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this paradigm, SNIP CAR-T cells grown in the absence of drug (OFF) manifest transcriptional and proteomic profiles distinct from constitutive CARs, associated with greater stemness, diminished exhaustion, and increased responsiveness to ex vivo antigen stimulation ( Figures 3 I, 3J, and 4 ). These results provide clear evidence that SNIP CARs are biologically distinct and more potent than constitutive CARs, which we posit results from variability in GPV levels associated with normal PK that oscillate CAR signaling, thereby preventing exhaustion and improving CAR-T cell function ( Weber et al., 2020 113. Weber, E.W. ∙ Lynn, R.C. ∙ Parker, K.R. ... Transient “rest” induces functional reinvigoration and epigenetic remodeling in exhausted CAR-T cells Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). In this study, we demonstrate that the SNIP platform enhances CAR-T functionality through a resting effect, and we have focused on 4-1BB costimulated CARs that are lead clinical candidates. However, tonic signaling CARs bearing CD28 endodomains often manifest higher degrees of exhaustion than 4-1BB CARs and would likely receive even greater benefit from rest. We demonstrated that SNIP serves as a bona fide safety switch in a ROR1 on-target off-tumor toxicity model ( Figures 6 E and 6F) and that the activity of SNIP ROR1 CARs can be tuned to fall within a TW by modulating the dose and frequency of GPV leading to 100% survival ( Figures 7 B–7E).
In a real-world setting, predicting the dose necessary to deliver a TW for individual patients could prove challenging due to interpatient variability in tumor burden, antigen expression, drug PK, and T cell potency. A detailed trial design for first-in-human testing of SNIP CARs is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but we envision a cautious cell and small molecule dose escalation strategy with careful toxicity monitoring and the option for individualized modulation of small molecule dosing based upon clinical endpoints. Using Bayesian adaptive study designs that are commonly employed in early phase trials and an experienced clinical team, we are confident that the approach would be feasible ( Chow, 2014 10. Chow, S.C. Adaptive clinical trial design Annu. Rev. Med. 2014; 65 :405-415 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fan et al., 2020 20. Fan, S. ∙ Lee, B.L. ∙ Lu, Y. A curve free Bayesian decision-theoretic design for phase Ia/Ib trials considering both safety and efficacy outcomes Stat. Biosci. 2020; 12 :146-166 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tunability of SNIP CAR-T cell functionality demonstrated here could create a new paradigm for CAR-T therapy, whereby higher T cell doses could be safely administered, which could ultimately improve patient responses, but activity could be titrated by drug dosing to avoid toxicity associated with rapid immune responses and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly in patients with high tumor burden. Clinical studies will be needed to establish the degree of tunability achievable in humans, particularly considering the longer half-life of GPV in humans compared with mice.
GPV has several features that make it a promising candidate for clinical use. It is (1) an FDA-approved drug, (2) a cell-permeable molecule that should penetrate well into tumor tissue, and (3) can be maintained at sufficiently high plasma concentrations with well-tolerated chronic-dosing regimens ( Caro et al., 2017 8. Caro, L. ∙ Wenning, L. ∙ Guo, Z. ... Effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Grazoprevir, a hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2017; 61 :e00813 e00817 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rockstroh et al., 2015 83. Rockstroh, J.K. ∙ Nelson, M. ∙ Katlama, C. ...

GPV has been reported to have poor blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability ( FDA, 2016 21. FDA Zepatier: pharmacology review(s) U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2016 https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2016/208261Orig1s000PharmR.pdf Google Scholar ). However, SNIP B7H3 CAR-T cells demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity in CNS tumor models compared with constitutive B7H3 CAR-T cells ( Figures 3 F–3H). Further studies are required to determine if SNIP CAR-T cells serve as vehicles that transport GPV into the CNS or if the kinetics of CAR-T cell trafficking between the CNS and the periphery allow for sufficient SNIP ON activity even if local GPV levels are limiting. It is also possible that GPV is able to cross due to increased BBB permeability in CNS tumor models.
Immunogenicity of the HCV-derived NS3p is a theoretical limitation of the SNIP system. However, it remains unclear if immunogenicity is a significant obstacle to CAR-T therapy in lymphodepleted patients, as the six highly-active FDA-approved CAR constructs to date utilize potentially immunogenic nonhuman scFvs. Furthermore, NS3p, which comprises the N-terminal domain (186 amino acids) of HCV NS3, is minimally immunogenic for T cell epitopes ( Erickson et al., 2001 18.

Comprehensive mapping of antigen specific T cell responses in hepatitis C virus infected patients with or without spontaneous viral clearance PLoS One. 2017; 12 :e0171217 PubMed Google Scholar ). If immune responses were induced, computational approach could be used to engineer NS3p variants to further reduce the potential for MHC-loaded peptides ( Desai and Kulkarni-Kale, 2014 15.

Immunol. 2020; 38 :123-145 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). The high degree of mutational plasticity of NS3p suggests that it would be amenable to such an approach ( López-Labrador et al., 2008 53. López-Labrador, F.X. ∙ Moya, A. ∙ Gonzàlez-Candelas, F.

In summary, we have introduced SNIP, a high-performance drug-regulated CAR platform that utilizes an FDA-approved small molecule to enable remote control and a generalizable molecular architecture that does not perturb CAR function. We demonstrated efficacy and safety of SNIP in ten different mouse models including four orthotopic solid tumor models targeting three different antigens and enhanced potency and safety of SNIP CARs compared with constitutive CARs. These studies provide foundational work poised for clinical translation to improve the safety, efficacy, and broader dissemination of CAR-T therapy.
Although we have demonstrated enhanced efficacy of SNIP CAR-T cells in NSG mice, immunogenicity of the virally derived NS3p could lead to limited T cell persistence and diminished activity. In addition, long-term functionality of SNIP CAR-T cells could not be assessed due to limitations of xenograft models for adoptively transferred T cell experiments (i.e., development of GVHD). Clinical studies are needed to assess the long-term functionality and immunogenicity of SNIP CAR-T cells. Moreover, GPV dosing strategies may not translate clinically owing to differences in PK of GPV between mice and humans and will need to be determined in clinical trials.

The Nalm6 B-ALL cell line was provided by David Barrett (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia) and retrovirally transduced to express GFP and firefly luciferase (N6-GL). Nalm6-GL was transduced with cDNA encoding human B7-H3 (Nalm6-B7H3) or human ROR1 (Nalm6-ROR1), and single cell clones were isolated from the transduced populations. 143B osteosarcoma cells (ATCC) were retrovirally transduced with GFP and luciferase (143B-GL). CHLA-255 neuroblastoma line was provided by Robert Seeger (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) and retrovirally transduced with GFP and firefly luciferase (CHLA-255). MG63.3 was provided by Chand Khanna (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health) and retrovirally transduced with GFP and firefly luciferase (MG63.3-GL). MED8A-GL was provided by S. Chesier (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). The 293GP retroviral packaging line was provided by the Surgery Branch (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health). Nalm6, 143B, MG63.3, and CHLA-255 were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco). MED8A and 293GP were cultured in DMEM (Gibco). Cell line culture media was supplemented with 10% FBS, 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), with the exception of MED8A which was cultured in an additional 10% FBS (completed DMEM at 20% FBS). STR DNA profiling of all cell lines was conducted once per year (Genetica Cell Line testing). All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma. Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 environment.
NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rgt m1Wjl /SzJ) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and bred in house under Stanford University APLAC-approved protocols. Healthy male and female mice were used for in vivo experiments between 6 and 10 weeks old at tumor engraftment and were drug naïve, and not involved in previous procedures. Mice were house in sterile cages in a barrier facility at Stanford University with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Veterinary Services Center (VSC) staff at Stanford University monitored the mice daily and were euthanized when mice manifested persistent hunched posture, persistent scruffy coat, paralysis, impaired mobility, greater than 20% weight loss, if tumors significantly interfered with normal bodily functions, or if they exceeded limits designated in APLAC-approved protocols. Per recommendation by VSC staff, mice with morbidities were supported with 500μL subcutaneous saline, diet gel (DietGel® 76A, ClearH2O), and wet chow.
Buffy coats from healthy donors were purchased from the Stanford Blood Center under an IRB-exempt-protocol. Primary human T cells were purified by negative selection using the RosetteSep Human T cell Enrichment kit (Stem Cell Technologies) and SepMate-50 tubes. T cells were cryopreserved at 1-2x10 7 cells per mL in CryoStor CS10 cryopreservation media (Stem Cell Technologies) until use.
All retroviral constructs were cloned into the MSGV1 retroviral vector ( Hughes et al., 2005 36. Hughes, M.S. ∙ Yu, Y.Y.L. ∙ Dudley, M.E. ... Transfer of a TCR gene derived from a patient with a marked antitumor response conveys highly active T-cell effector functions Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16 :457-472 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). B7H3.BBz was generated by fusing, from N to C terminus, a human GM-CSF leader sequence, scFv derived from MGA271 in the VH-VL orientation and (GGGS) 3 linker sequence, CD8α hinge and transmembrane sequence, and human 4-1BB and CD3ζ intracellular signaling domains. Cis SNIP scFv was generated by inserting a cis protease control module comprised of an HA-tag, 4A-4B cleavage site (DEMEECSQH), NS4a cofactor domain, and NS3(ai) protease into the B7H3.BBz vector between the scFv and CD8α hinge domain ( Jacobs et al., 2018 39. Jacobs, C.L. ∙ Badiee, R.K. ∙ Lin, M.Z. StaPLs: versatile genetically encoded modules for engineering drug-inducible proteins Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :523-526 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cis SNIP BBz was generated by inserting the cis protease control module into the B7H3.BBz vector between the CD8α transmembrane domain and the 4-1BB signaling domain. Trans SNIP BBz was expressed in bicistronic format using B7H3.BBz as the base vector. Briefly, a linker sequence containing 4A-4B cleavage site was integrated between the CD8α transmembrane domain and the 4-1BB signaling domain. The stop codon in the CD3ζ was replaced with a sequence containing a porcine teschovirus-1 2A (P2A) ribosomal skipping sequence, TCR- β leader sequence, RQR8 detection module containing epitopes for Qbend10 and rituximab antibodies, CD8α hinge, CD8α transmembrane domain, CD8α intracellular anchor domain, linker sequence (GSSSGNSSGGS), NS4A cofactor domain and NS3(ai) protease ( Philip et al., 2014 77. Philip, B. ∙ Kokalaki, E. ∙ Mekkaoui, L. ... A highly compact epitope-based marker/suicide gene for easier and safer T-cell therapy Blood. 2014; 124 :1277-1287 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). SNIP cut site 1 refers to the Trans SNIP BBz with the 4a-4b sequence. SNIP cut site 2 and 3 were generated by replacing the 4A-4B site in Trans SNIP BBz with a 5A-5B (EDVVPCSMGS) and 4B-5A site (ECTTPCSGSWL), respectively. For transmembrane matching experiments, the CD8 TM refers to the CD8α hinge and transmembrane, whereas the CD28 TM refers to the CD28 hinge and transmembrane domain, which were cloned into the Trans SNIP BBz vector. GD2.BBz, HER2.BBz, and CD19.BBz were generated by cloning scFvs derived from 14G2A, 4D5, and FMC63 antibodies, respectively into the B7H3.BBz vector. CD19.28z was generated by replacing the 4-1BB domain in CD19.BBz with the intracellular signaling domain of human CD28. ROR1(R11).IgG4.BBz was generated as previously described ( Srivastava et al., 2019 99. Srivastava, S. ∙ Salter, A.I. ∙ Liggitt, D. ...

ROR1(F).28z and ROR1(F).BBz were generated by replacing the FMC63 scFv with the clone F scFv in the CD19.28z and CD19.BBz vectors, respectively ( Nathwani et al., 2019 69. Nathwani, A. ∙ Satyen, G. ∙ Della Peruta, M. WO 2019/008378 Al - ROR1 CAR T-cells WIPO, 2019 https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2019008378 Google Scholar ).

Retroviral supernatant was packaged using 293GP cells and the RD114 envelope plasmid. In brief, 11μg RD114 and 22μg of the corresponding MSGV1 transfer plasmid were delivered to 293GP cells grown on 150mm poly-D-lysine dishes (Corning) to 80% confluency by transient transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher). Media was replenished every 24 hours. Virus production was performed side-by-side for comparable CAR constructs. Retroviral supernatant was harvested 48 and 72-hour post transfection. Supernatant from replicate dishes were pooled, centrifuged to deplete cell debris, and stored at -80C until use. Third-generation, self-inactivating lentiviral supernatant was similarly produced with 293T cells using 7μg pMD2.G (VSVg) envelope, 18μg pMDLg/pRRE (Gag/Pol), 18μg pRSV-Rev, and 20μg the corresponding transfer plasmids.
At Day 0, primary human T cells were thawed and activated with anti-CD3/CD28 Human T-Expander Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) at a 3:1 bead to cell ratio. On Day 2 virus coated culture plates were prepared on non TC-treated 12-well plates that had been pre-coated with RetroNectin (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, by incubating with 1mL of retroviral supernatant (2x10 7 -5x10 7 TU/mL) and centrifugation at 3200 RPM, 32 °C for two hours. The supernatant was subsequently aspirated off of the wells and 0.5x10 6 T cells were added in 1mL of T cell media comprised of: AIM V (Thermo Fisher), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin (Gibco), 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), and 100 U/mL rhIL-2 (Peprotech). After addition of the T cells, the plates were gently spun down at 1200 RPM for 2 min then incubated for 24hrs at 37°C 5% CO 2 . This transduction process was repeated at Day 3. Dynabeads were removed on Day 4 by magnetic separation. Cells were maintained between 0.4 - 2x10 6 cells/mL and expanded until Day 10.
For in vitro experiments, grazoprevir (Acme Bioscience, custom synthesis) was reconstituted in DMSO to 1000x stock solution and frozen at -80°C. For in vivo experiments, grazoprevir potassium salt (Acme Bioscience, custom synthesis) was reconstituted to 60mg/mL in 100% PEG 300 (Rigaku) by incubation in a 37°C water bath and vortexing. Ritonavir (ACROS Organic), which was used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer due to the short plasma half-life of GPV in mice ( FDA, 2016 21. FDA Zepatier: pharmacology review(s) U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2016 https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2016/208261Orig1s000PharmR.pdf Google Scholar ; Feng et al., 2019 22.

Osmotic pumps (Alzet, model 2002) with a 0.5μL/hr release rate were filled with the indicated concentration of grazoprevir/ritonavir according to the manufacturer’s instructions and primed in DPBS at 37°C 24 hours prior to implantation. Pumps were subcutaneously implanted in the right flank of mice 24hr prior to T cell administration. Oral formulations were prepared at the indicated concentration in gavage diluent (70% (v/v) PEG 300, 5% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma), and 5% (v/v) DPBS (Gibco)), aliquoted, and stored at -80°C. Drug was delivered to mice by oral gavage in a total volume of 100μL using 20 gauge 30mm feeding tubes (Instech). For in vivo studies, pumps were implanted 24hr prior to T cell administration. Mice were dosed with 50mg/kg GPV+25mg/kg RTV 2-3 times per day unless otherwise indicated such as the modified drug dosing scheme in the ROR1 toxicity models, where no pumps were implanted and drug was dosed at 25 mg/kg GPV + 2.5mg/kg RTV by oral gavage once per day.
5x10 4 GFP or RFP-labeled tumor cells were cocultured with 5x10 4 GFP CAR-T cells in 200μL RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100μg/mL streptomycin. Triplicate wells were plated in 96-well flat-bottom plates for each condition. Tumor fluorescence was monitored every 2-3 hours with a 10x objective using the Incucyte Zoom system (Essen Bioscience), housed in a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 , set to take 4 images per well at each time point. Total integrated GFP or RFP intensity was quantified using the Zoom software (Essen Bioscience). Data were normalized to the first timepoint and plotted as fold change in tumor fluorescence over time. For cytokine secretion analysis, cocultures were setup as above except in 96-well round bottom plates. After approximately 24 hours, plates were spun down to pellet cells and 100uL of supernatant was harvested and stored at -80°C until analysis. IFNγ and IL-2 levels in coculture supernatants were quantified by ELISA (Human ELISA MAX Deluxe, Biolegend) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Negative cytokine values were set to 0. Coculture experiments were setup using day 10 T cells, with the exception of On/Off kinetics experiments in Figures 1 G and S1 F, which were setup on Day 14.
Whole-cell protein lysates were obtained in non-denaturing buffer as previously described ( Lynn et al., 2019 54. Lynn, R.C. ∙ Weber, E.W. ∙ Sotillo, E. ... C-Jun overexpression in CAR T cells induces exhaustion resistance Nature. 2019; 576 :293-300 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Protein concentrations were estimated by Bio-Rad colorimetric assay. Immunoblotting was performed by loading 10 μg of protein onto 7.5% PAGE gels followed by transfer to PVF membranes. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) or with the Odyssey imaging system. The CD3-zeta (4A12-F6) primary antibody was purchased from Abcam. Total ERK1/2 (#9102) and GAPDH (#97166) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling and used as loading control. Images were cropped to exclude non-relevant gel lanes.
Clone F anti-ROR1 antibodies were expressed in full length human IgG1 format. Heavy chain and light chain sequences were ordered as gblock gene fragments (IDT) and individually cloned into the cytomegalovirus-driven adenoviral shuttle vector pAdd2 using standard Gibson assembly. Cloned expression vectors were transfected into Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher, A14526) in a 1:1 weight ratio of heavy chain to light chain and expressed according to manufacturer’s protocol. Antibody was purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography (Protein A Sepharose, Thermo Fisher, 101041). The purified antibody was fluorescently labeled with the DyLight 650 Microscale Antibody Labeling Kit (Thermo Fisher).
Human ROR1 (UniProt ID Q01973 ) was cloned into the MSGV1 vector and used to transduce N6-GL cells. Briefly, dilutions of hROR1 retroviral supernatant were prepared from 1 to 1:100 and used to coat RetroNectin plates as described above. 5x10 5 N6-GL cells were transduced per well for 48 hours. Cells were expanded for seven days, stained for ROR1 expression using 3μg/mL clone F antibody conjugated with DyLight 650, then FACS-sorted into bins according to expression levels using a FACSAria II SORP. N6-ROR1 cells were expanded for seven more days before single-cell cloning by limiting dilution into 96-well plates. Wells that contained cells were grown to dense cultures prior to analysis of ROR1 expression levels and further expansion.
Recombinant B7H3-, HER2-, and human ROR1-Fc (R&D systems) were used to detection B7H3, HER2, and ROR1 surface CAR, respectively. Likewise, anti-FMC63 and anti-14g2a idiotype antibodies were used to detect CD19 and GD2 CAR, respectively. CAR detection reagents were fluorescently labeled with the DyLight 650 Microscale Antibody Labeling Kit (Thermo Fisher). Surface CAR was stained by incubation with 3 μg/mL CAR detection reagents for 30min at 4C. Quantification of B7H3 surface molecules on cancer lines was performed using the Quantum™ Simply Cellular® anti-Human IgG kit (Bangs Laboratories, Inc.). All antibodies and detection reagents used in this study are listed in the key resources table . Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Fortessa instrument.
Mice were administered either 200μL of 15 μg/mL D-luciferin or a 1:40 dilution of Nano-Glo substrate (Promega, diluted in DPBS) by intraperitoneal injection for firefly luciferase and Antares imaging, respectively. Images were acquired on an IVIS imaging system 5 min after injection using 30 sec exposures and medium binning. If saturated pixels were detected in the image, an additional image was acquired using the auto-expose setting. Total flux was measured using Living Image software with a region of interest around the body of each mouse. Only non-saturated images were used for quantification of BLI. Mice were randomized prior to T cell administration to ensure uniform distribution of tumor burden between groups. At the end of the experiment, all images were collected into a single sequence on Living Image and set to the same luminescence scale.
Six to ten-week old NSG male or female mice were implanted with 1x10 6 N6-B7H3, N6-GL, or N6-ROR1 cells by tail vein injection.

Mice were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane (Minrad International) in an induction chamber and maintained during surgery on the stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments) delivered through a nose adaptor. 0.12x10 6 MED8A-GL medulloblastoma cells were injected at coordinates 2 mm posterior to lambda on midline and 2 mm deep into 6- to 10-week-old NSG mice using a blunt-ended needle (75N, 26s/2″/2, 5 μL; Hamilton Co.). Using a microinjection pump (UMP-3; World Precision Instruments), MED8A-GL cells were injected in a volume of 3 μL at 30 nL/s. After leaving the needle in place for 1-2 minutes, it was retracted at 3 mm/min. Fourteen days after tumor implantation and after confirmation of tumor formation by bioluminescence, mice were randomized and treated with 3x10 6 SNIP or constitutive B7H3.BBz CAR-T cells or an equivalent number of Mock T cells intravenously by tail vein injection. One group of mice that received SNIP B7H3 CAR-T cells were implanted with osmotic pumps containing 54 mg/mL GPV and 6 mg/mL RTV on Day 13 post-tumor implantation and administered 50 mg/kg GPV and 25mg/kg RTV by oral gavage 1-2 times per day (SNIP ON) or given no drug (SNIP OFF).

Spleens and tumors were harvested at Day 15 post tumor implantation. Tumors were mechanically dissociated using a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi). Single-cell suspensions were made by passing tumors and spleens through a 70μm cell strainer, depleting red blood cells by ACK lysis (Quality Biological Inc.), and further filtration through flow cytometry filter tubes with 35μm cell strainer caps (Falcon). T cells were purified by magnetic separation using the REAlease® CD4/CD8 (TIL) MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunophenotyping of splenic T cells and TILs was performed with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. Intracellular staining was performed after fixation and permeabilization of T cells (Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set Kit, eBioscience). Before intracellular cytokine staining, 0.1x10 6 T cells were activated with plate-bounded HER2 Fc (coated at 5μg/ml) in the presence of monensin (eBioscience) for 12hrs at 37°C. Cells were analyzed with BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed with FlowJo Mac version 10.7.1 (Tree Star).
T cells were labeled with 5μM CTV (CellTrace Violet Cell Proliferation Kit, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 5 min followed by addition of ice-cold PBS 2% FBS to quench the reaction. Next, cells were washed and resuspended in complete RPMI 1640. 2x10 4 cells were plated onto HER2 Fc-coated plate (coated at 5μg/ml). After 96hrs, CTV dilution was assessed by flow cytometry.
TILs from the 143B osteosarcoma model described above were purified from tumors 10 days after T cell administration using the REAlease® CD4/CD8 (TIL) MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sent to the Stanford Functional Genomics facility for single-cell RNAseq library preparation using the Chromium Single Cell 3' Solution v3 platform (10x GENOMICS). Libraries were sent to Novogene for sequencing on a NovoSeq S4 lane (PE150) with >53,000 reads per cell. Reads were aligned and quantified with Cell Ranger (10x GENOMICS) using the standard workflow, with the exception that the reference transcriptome (GRCh38-and-mm10) was modified to include the 3’ UTR and LTR of the MSGV1 vector, which allowed for gating on CAR + T cells. The Cell Ranger output was imported into R using the Seurat package. The following filters were applied using the subset function to select for live human single CAR-T cells: nFeature_RNA > 1500 & nFeature_RNA < 4200; percent mitochondrial reads < 12.5% & > 3.5%; percent mouse reads < 1.5%; percent CD3D > 0.01%; percent heat shock proteins < 0.75%, percent CAR reads > 0.005%, and percent mouse mitochondrial reads < 0.04%. The data matrix was scaled and transformed with the SCTransform pipeline ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 32. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential expression analysis, clustering, UMAP dimensionality reduction and cell-cycle analysis were performed on the resulting data matrix using the Seurat package ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 32. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used the standard cell cycle scoring workflow based on genes from Tirosh et al. to categorize each cell based on a G2M and S gene expression score. Cells that do not express G2M or S genes are assumed non-cycling and were assigned to the G1 category ( Tirosh et al., 2016 108. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Crossref Scopus (1694) PubMed Google Scholar ).
1-2 x10 6 cells were harvested from cell culture, washed 2x in PBS (10x stock, Rockland), and stained for viability with 250nM cisplatin (FLUIDIGM). The cisplatin reaction was quenched after a 3 minute incubation at room temperature with cell staining media (CSM, 1x PBS with.02% sodium azide and 0.05% BSA). Cells were centrifuged then resuspended in fixation solution containing 1.6% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 150μL CryoStor, flash frozen, then stored at -80°C. For analysis, cells were thawed, washed in 5mL CSM, then barcoded and pooled with the Cell-ID™ 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit (FLUIDIGM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CyTOF antibodies (see key resources table ) were added to the barcoded sample, incubated on ice for 1 hr. Washed 3X with CSM, then resuspended in Ir-Intercalator ( 500μm iridium intercalator +1% PFA+ 1X PBS). Before acquisition cells were washed 1X with CSM and 3 times with ddH2O. After 2 water washes, cells were resuspended with 1x EQ™ Four Element Calibration Beads (FLUIDIGM) and acquired on a Helios mass cytometer (FLUIDIGM). After acquisition, data was normalized using MATLAB-based algorithm ( Finck et al., 2013 23. Finck, R. ∙ Simonds, E.F. ∙ Jager, A. ... Normalization of mass cytometry data with bead standards Cytometry A. 2013; 83 :483-494 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ) and debarcoded using the MATLAB Single Cell Debarcoder tool.
Data collected in.fcs file format were analyzed on OMIQ platform ( www.omiq.ai ). To avoid debris and doublets, our gating scheme excluded calibration beads, aggregates using DNA signal and event length ( Mei et al., 2015 62. Mei, H.E. ∙ Leipold, M.D. ∙ Schulz, A.R. ... Barcoding of live human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for multiplexed mass cytometry J. Immunol. 2015; 194 :2022-2031 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). We applied opt-SNE ( Belkina et al., 2019 4. Belkina, A.C. ∙ Ciccolella, C.O. ∙ Anno, R. ... Automated optimized parameters for T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding improve visualization and analysis of large datasets Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5415 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ) to each sample cohort, using 22 markers and the default settings for number iterations, perplexity and theta. We used equal subsampling of 6,500 events of total CAR+CD4+ or CD8+ T cells per sample. The following differentially expressed markers were used for opt-SNE: CD25, CD27, CD69, CD622L, CD45RO, OX-40, CD38, TIM3, TIGIT, Tbet, CTLA4, Foxp3, CD272, CD39, Lag3, CCR7, CD127, CD45RA, CD122, 41BB, and PD1.
Constitutive or SNIP HER2.BBz, B7H3.BBz, and GD2.BBz CAR-T cell were manufactured from healthy donor T cells as described above. SNIP CAR-T cells were cultured in the absence of drug (SNIP OFF). RNA was extracted from Day 10 in vitro T cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and send to NovoGene for library preparation, PE150 sequencing with a minimum of 6G raw output per sample, and demultiplexing. Reads were pseudo-aligned using Salmon ( Patro et al., 2017 75. Patro, R. ∙ Duggal, G. ∙ Love, M.I. ... Salmon provides fast and bias-aware quantification of transcript expression Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :417-419 Crossref Scopus (2743) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential gene expression analysis was performed with the R package DESeq2. All three CARs (HER2, B7H3, and GD2) were grouped for the analysis.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the GSEA software (Broad Institute) as described ( Mootha et al., 2003 65. Mootha, V.K. ∙ Lindgren, C.M. ∙ Eriksson, K.F. ... PGC-1alpha-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes Nat. Genet. 2003; 34 :267-273 Crossref Scopus (5550) PubMed Google Scholar ; Subramanian et al., 2005 103. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ...

USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (23054) PubMed Google Scholar ) using publicly available data sets GSE9650 and Good et al. (2021) 28. Good, C.R. ∙ Aznar, M.A. ∙ Kuramitsu, S. ... An NK-like CAR T cell transition in CAR T cell dysfunction Cell. 2021; 184 :6081-6100.e26 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar , GSEA analysis of HA GD2 exhausted CAR T cell signature was performed as previously described ( Good et al., 2021 28. Good, C.R. ∙ Aznar, M.A. ∙ Kuramitsu, S. ... An NK-like CAR T cell transition in CAR T cell dysfunction Cell. 2021; 184 :6081-6100.e26 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861191/ ) with slight modifications. We merged CD4 and CD8 populations and generated a signature of n=99 genes upregulated in HA-GD2 and a signature of n=101 genes upregulated in CD19 CAR expressing cells.

Mouse liver, kidney, and spleen smart-seq datasets were accessed from the Tabula Muris cell atlas ( Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018 104. Tabula Muris Consortium, Overall Coordination, Logistical Coordination, Organ Collection and Processing, Library Preparation and Sequencing, Computational Data Analysis, Cell Type Annotation, Writing Group, Supplemental Text Writing Group, Principal investigators Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris Nature. 2018; 562 :367-372 Crossref Scopus (778) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the mouse lung data was accessed from the Raredon et al. dataset ( Raredon et al., 2019 79. Raredon, M.S.B. ∙ Adams, T.S. ∙ Suhail, Y. ... Single-cell connectomic analysis of adult mammalian lungs Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaaw3851 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cell by gene counts tables were processed using Scanpy v.1.4.3. Low quality cells were first excluded based on the following criteria: excluding cells with fewer than 250 genes, or 500 counts, or more than 25% mitochondrial reads. The remaining cells were depth-normalized to a total of 10,000 reads per cell. The depth-normalized gene expression values were then log-transformed with a pseudocount of 1. sc.pp.high_variable_genes was used to identify the top 2000 variable genes, and effects associated with the number of genes per cell were regressed out. Data was scaled with a max value of 10, and PCA was performed with default settings. Leiden clustering was performed to identify clusters of related cells. Gene expression values were visualized as log-transformed counts, using markers for known cell types identified from the literature. Violin plots were generated by sampling 500 cells from each dataset and plotting ROR1 expression for all cells and the cluster with the highest mean expression of ROR1.
ROR1 CAR vectors were made as described in the viral vector construction section. Six to ten-week old NSG male or female mice were treated with the ROR1 CAR-T or mock T cells at the dose indicated in the figure legends by tail vein injection. To examine if radiation was required to induce toxicity, one group of mice that received ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells was preconditioned with 2.2 Gy using a Kimtron IC-225 irradiator 5 hours prior to T cell administration. Mice in ROR1(F).28z and SNIP ROR1(F).28z ON (High GPV) groups experienced rapid onset of toxicity (within 24-48 hours) observed clinically as hunched posture,scruffy coat, slow movement, dehydration, and weight loss. Treatment-related toxicity was monitored by weight change, which was measured prior to T cell administration and 1-2x per week thereafter. %weight change was calculated according to % 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑡 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 = ( ( 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑡 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑥 ) / ( 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑡 ) − 1 ) ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 1 0 0 . Mice died from toxicity or were euthanized if they reached 20% weight loss or showed clinical signs of severe toxicity, as described in the Animal Models section. Mice treated with SNIP ROR1(F).28z CAR-T cells were administered GPV/RTV as indicated in the figure legends. For tumor-bearing ROR1 toxicity models, 1x10 6 Nalm6-ROR1 leukemia cells were engrafted in NSG mice by tail vein injection 24 hours prior to T cell administration. The specific single cell clones used for in vivo experiments are C5 in Figures 7 B–7D, and C1 and C3 for ROR1Low and ROR1Med, respectively, in Figures S7 E and S7F. Tumor progression was monitored by firefly luciferase BLI.
Lungs and livers of CAR-T-treated mice were harvested, fixed by immersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin, routinely processed, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Paraffin tissue blocks were sent to MD Biosciences (Oakdale, Minnesota) for CD3 immunohistochemistry. The assay was run on the Ventana Discovery Ultra. Slides were deparaffinized and then underwent retrieval at 95°C with CC1. Then Inhibitor CM was first applied followed by prediluted anti-CD3 antibody (clone 2GV6) for 24 minutes at 37°C. Chromogenic staining was generated via OmniMap anti-Rb HRP secondary application and Diaminobenzidine (DAB) reagents. Hematoxylin II and Bluing reagents were used for counterstaining. Slides were cover slipped with Leica Micromount Media.
For in vivo tumor-growth curves, significance was computed at the indicated timepoint on the plot by unpaired two-tailed t test comparing the constitutive group with the SNIP ON group. Significance for survival data was calculated using the log-rank Mantel–Cox test. Statistical analysis on flow cytometry quantification was computed by unpaired two-tailed t test comparing the indicated groups, unless otherwise indicated. All statistical tests were performed on GraphPad Prism 8. Asterisks denoting statistical significance are in Graphpad Prism style with one, two, three, or four asterisks representing P values less than 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001, respectively.
