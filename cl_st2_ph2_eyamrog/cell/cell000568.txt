Title: Emerging enterococcus pore-forming toxins with MHC/HLA-I as receptors


Abstract: Summary

Enterococci are a part of human microbiota and a leading cause of multidrug resistant infections. Here, we identify a family of Enterococcus pore-forming toxins (Epxs) in E. faecalis , E. faecium , and E. hirae strains isolated across the globe. Structural studies reveal that Epxs form a branch of β-barrel pore-forming toxins with a β-barrel protrusion (designated the top domain) sitting atop the cap domain. Through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identify human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) complex as a receptor for two members (Epx2 and Epx3), which preferentially recognize human HLA-I and homologous MHC-I of equine, bovine, and porcine, but not murine, origin. Interferon exposure, which stimulates MHC-I expression, sensitizes human cells and intestinal organoids to Epx2 and Epx3 toxicity. Co-culture with Epx2-harboring E. faecium damages human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal organoids, and this toxicity is neutralized by an Epx2 antibody, demonstrating the toxin-mediated virulence of Epx-carrying Enterococcus .

Section: Introduction

Conversion of harmless bacteria into pathogens by mobile elements has been described since the landmark 1950s finding that diphtheria toxin was conveyed by a temperate phage ( Freeman, 1951 18. Freeman, V.J. Studies on the virulence of bacteriophage-infected strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae J. Bacteriol. 1951; 61 :675-688 Google Scholar ). Enterococci are a part of gut commensal bacteria of land-based animals ( Lebreton et al., 2017 30. Lebreton, F. ∙ Manson, A.L. ∙ Saavedra, J.T. ... Tracing the Enterococci from Paleozoic Origins to the Hospital Cell. 2017; 169 :849-861.e13 Google Scholar ). Since the 1970s, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium have emerged as leading causes of multidrug resistant (MDR) infections ( Arias and Murray, 2012 4. Arias, C.A. ∙ Murray, B.E. The rise of the Enterococcus: beyond vancomycin resistance Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10 :266-278 Google Scholar ; Fiore et al., 2019 16. Fiore, E. ∙ Van Tyne, D. ∙ Gilmore, M.S.

Van Tyne, D. ∙ Gilmore, M.S. Friend turned foe: evolution of enterococcal virulence and antibiotic resistance Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 68 :337-356 Google Scholar ). Recent studies have also reported a role of E. faecalis in alcoholic liver disease ( Duan et al., 2019 12. Duan, Y. ∙ Llorente, C. ∙ Lang, S. ... Bacteriophage targeting of gut bacterium attenuates alcoholic liver disease Nature. 2019; 575 :505-511 Google Scholar ) and a role of E. hirae, the third most abundant Enterococcus species in human microbiota, in regulating immune responses to tumor antigens ( Fluckiger et al., 2020 17. Fluckiger, A. ∙ Daillère, R. ∙ Sassi, M. ... Cross-reactivity between tumor MHC class I-restricted antigens and an enterococcal bacteriophage Science. 2020; 369 :936-942 Google Scholar ). Enterococci are well known for their intrinsic and recently acquired resistance to antibiotics ( Van Tyne and Gilmore, 2014 64. Van Tyne, D. ∙ Gilmore, M.S. Friend turned foe: evolution of enterococcal virulence and antibiotic resistance Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 68 :337-356 Google Scholar ), leading to high mortality in infections difficult to eradicate. Some isolates of E. faecalis express a post-translationally modified anti-microbial peptide bacteriocin known as cytolysin, which can lyse both bacteria and eukaryotic cells and contribute to pathogenesis ( Coburn et al., 2004 8. Coburn, P.S. ∙ Pillar, C.M. ∙ Jett, B.D. ... Enterococcus faecalis senses target cells and in response expresses cytolysin Science. 2004; 306 :2270-2272 Google Scholar ; Van Tyne et al., 2013 65. Van Tyne, D. ∙ Martin, M.J. ∙ Gilmore, M.S. Structure, function, and biology of the Enterococcus faecalis cytolysin Toxins (Basel). 2013; 5 :895-911 Google Scholar ). However, the genus Enterococcus is not known to express any potent protein toxin family with an established specificity targeting human and animal cells.
Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are the most common class of bacterial toxins ( Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016 9. Dal Peraro, M. ∙ van der Goot, F.G. Pore-forming toxins: ancient, but never really out of fashion Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :77-92 Google Scholar ; Los et al., 2013 32. Los, F.C. ∙ Randis, T.M. ∙ Aroian, R.V. ... Role of pore-forming toxins in bacterial infectious diseases Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2013; 77 :173-207 Google Scholar ). They are produced as soluble monomers that oligomerize and form transmembrane pores on cell surfaces. A variety of PFTs have evolved to disrupt epithelial barriers, disable immune cells, and damage tissues. PFTs can be divided into α-PFTs with transmembrane pores composed of α helices and β-PFTs with pores composed of β barrels. β-PFTs further include two classes of small β-barrel PFTs—the haemolysin and aerolysin families—as well as the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family that forms large pores ( Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016 9. Dal Peraro, M. ∙ van der Goot, F.G. Pore-forming toxins: ancient, but never really out of fashion Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :77-92 Google Scholar ).
The well-studied Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin (Hla, also known as αHL or α-toxin) is the archetype for the haemolysin family ( Berube and Bubeck Wardenburg, 2013 5. Berube, B.J. ∙ Bubeck Wardenburg, J. Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin: nearly a century of intrigue Toxins (Basel). 2013; 5 :1140-1166 Google Scholar ). It is produced as a 292-residue monomer and assembles into a mushroom-shaped heptameric pore ( Song et al., 1996 52. Song, L. ∙ Hobaugh, M.R. ∙ Shustak, C. ... Structure of staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin, a heptameric transmembrane pore Science. 1996; 274 :1859-1866 Google Scholar ). Other haemolysin family members include S. aureus leukocidin toxins, necrotic enteritis B-like toxin (NetB), beta toxin and delta toxin from C. perfringens , and Vibrio cholerae cytolysin toxin ( Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016 9. Dal Peraro, M. ∙ van der Goot, F.G. Pore-forming toxins: ancient, but never really out of fashion Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :77-92 Google Scholar ). Crystal structures of these toxins show highly conserved conformations in their monomeric states and assembled pores, with a variation consisting of bi-component leukocidin toxins forming hetero-octameric pores composed of four units of each component in alternating order ( De and Olson, 2011 10. De, S. ∙ Olson, R. Crystal structure of the Vibrio cholerae cytolysin heptamer reveals common features among disparate pore-forming toxins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The archetypical aerolysin forms heptameric β-barrel transmembrane pores as well but differs from Hla in the overall domain arrangement ( Degiacomi et al., 2013 11.

Although small β-barrel PFTs can form pores non-specifically at high concentrations in vitro , specific host protein receptors have been identified, establishing the key role of receptors in determining toxin host species and cell type selectivity ( Alonzo et al., 2013 3.

For instance, S. aureus leukocidin toxins Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), γ-haemolysin CB (HlgCB), and leukocidin A/B (LukAB) recognize the human orthologs of their respective receptors, but not the murine orthologs ( DuMont et al., 2013 13.

As part of ongoing surveillance studies of enterococci genomes collected from animals and the environment, we identified two uncharacterized small β-barrel PFTs homologous to haemolysin family members. Searching public databases revealed a family of β-barrel PFTs in E. faecalis , E. faecium , and E. hirae . Structural studies revealed that these toxins form a sub-class of the haemolysin family. Through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) complex as a receptor for two of these toxins, which recognize human HLA-I and homologous major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) of equine, bovine, and porcine, but not murine, origin. We further showed that a toxin-harboring E. faecium strain induces death of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and damages intestinal organoids in a toxin-dependent manner during co-culture, demonstrating toxin-mediated virulence.

Section: Results

To understand how the natural reservoir of Enterococcus traits predisposes them to emerge as MDR hospital pathogens, we have collected and sequenced enterococcal strains since 2011. In 2018, we observed a potential small β-barrel PFT gene in an E. faecalis strain from chicken meat from North Carolina and another in an E. faecium strain from horse feces collected in Montana, which we termed Enterococcus pore-forming toxins 1 and 2 (Epx1 and Epx2), respectively. The closest homolog is C. perfringens delta toxin (42% and 43% identity to Epx1 and Epx2, respectively). Searching public databases revealed two more toxins (Epx3 and Epx4) at the beginning of our study, and our most recent search identified four additional homologs (Epxs5–8) ( Goncharov et al., 2016 20.

Surveillance of Enterococcus spp. reveals distinct species and antimicrobial resistance diversity across a One-Health continuum Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :3937 Google Scholar ). These Epxs are 40%–89% identical to each other and form a separate branch from other PFTs ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ).
Epxs have been identified in three Enterococcus species: Epxs1 and 3 in E. faecalis , Epxs2 and 7 in E. faecium , and Epxs4, 5, 6, and 8 in E. hirae ( Figure 1 B; Table S2 ). These strains were collected across five continents and from diverse sources such as chicken meat, turkey, dairy cows, horse feces, mouse colon, 40,000-year-old mammoth intestine, and wastewater, as well as human samples (stool, bodily fluid, a gluteal abscess in the United States, and a liver abscess in France) ( Figure 1 C; Table S2 ).
Comparing the genomes of these isolates with available reference genomes (WGS RefSeq) of E. faecalis (n = 1743; Figure 1 D), E. faecium (n = 2197; Figure 1 E), and E. hirae (n = 190; Figure 1 F) reveals that Epx-carrying isolates are not monophyletic, indicating multiple acquisition events. Notably, an Epx1-carrying E. faecalis isolate, belonging to a highly persistent ST-108 lineage of poultry and human isolates, carries the vancomycin-resistance gene ( Figure 1 D; Table S2 ). Furthermore, Epx2-carrying E. faecium strains are closely related to known lineages of hospital-adapted MDR isolates of E. faecium clade A ( Figure 1 E) ( Lebreton et al., 2013 29. Lebreton, F. ∙ van Schaik, W. ∙ McGuire, A.M. ... Emergence of epidemic multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium from animal and commensal strains MBio. 2013; 4 e00534–e00513 Google Scholar ).
Further analysis of the DNA surrounding the epx genes revealed no overall conservation between different Epx types, except for Epxs4 and 5 within E. hirae ( Figure S1 ). However, within each Epx type, the genetic organization was conserved. No common auxiliary regulatory or secretion systems were found ( Figure S1 ). Analysis of isolates with complete genomes (n = 6) suggested that epx1 , 2 , and 6 are conveyed by large conjugative plasmids in three strains of E. faecalis , E. faecium , and E. hirae , respectively, whereas epx4 , 5 , and 8 are localized within the chromosomes of E. hirae strains ( Figure S1 ).
Long-read sequencing of the Epx2-harboring E. faecium strain DIV0147 (isolated in the United States) confirmed that epx2 is in a repUS15 family plasmid (named p0147_Epx2; Figure 1 G). An identical Epx2 gene was found in another E. faecium isolate, 58M, from Siberia ( Goncharov et al., 2016 20. Goncharov, A. ∙ Grigorjev, S. ∙ Karaseva, A. ... Draft Genome Sequence of Enterococcus faecium Strain 58m, Isolated from Intestinal Tract Content of a Woolly Mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius Genome Announc. 2016; 4 :e01706-e01715 Google Scholar ) that shared 98.9% nucleotide identity with DIV0147. The Epx2-carrying plasmids in 58M and DIV0147 are nearly identical (>97% nucleotide identity), suggesting that both strains vertically inherited the Epx2-plasmid. The plasmid backbone includes genes encoding a type IV secretion system and pilus assembly likely associated with its conjugative ability. These plasmids showed lower GC content (∼30%) than the average Enterococcus chromosome (37%–38%).
To validate the function of Epxs, we produced Epxs1–4 in E. coli ( Figures S2, S3 A, and S3B). All four Epxs at a concentration of 100 μg/mL induced death of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells ( Figure S3 C). We then assessed the susceptibility of a range of human cell lines (HEK293, HeLa, A549, Huh7, U2OS, and 5637; Figures 1 H and S3 D) and cell lines from other species (green monkey Vero cells, an immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cell line, dog MDCK cells, and Drosophila S2 cells; Figure S3 E) by exposing cells to dilutions of toxins and measuring cell viability with the MTT assay.
Epx2 is one of the most potent PFTs known for HeLa cells, with the dose resulting in loss of viability of 50% cells (IC 50 ) at ∼11–14 ng/mL, which is ∼100-fold more toxic than Epx3 and ∼3,000-fold more toxic than Epx1 and Epx4 ( Figure 1 H). Epx1 and Epx4 showed IC 50 >25 μg/mL on all cell lines ( Figure S3 D), whereas Epx2 and Epx3 showed variable toxicity for different cell lines ( Figure S3 D). Vero cells are highly sensitive to Epx2 and Epx3, whereas the toxicities on BMDM, MDCK, and S2 cells are low for all four Epxs ( Figure S3 E).
All four Epxs are capable of inducing lysis of artificial liposomes in vitro ( Figures 1 I and S3 F). The presence of liposomes promoted formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant oligomers similar to other PFTs ( Figure S3 G), and we directly observed Epx2 pores on liposomes by negative-staining electron microscopy (EM; Figure 1 J).
We next carried out crystallization screens and obtained the crystals of Epx4, which diffracted to 3.0 Å resolution ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Table S3 ). The structure unexpectedly revealed an assembled octameric pore instead of a monomer ( Figure 2 A). This is likely due to the presence of 40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) in the crystallization buffer, which has been shown to induce pore formation of Hla, γ-hemolysin, and leukocidin toxins during crystallization ( Tanaka et al., 2011 58. Tanaka, Y. ∙ Hirano, N. ∙ Kaneko, J. ... 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol induces spontaneous assembly of staphylococcal α-hemolysin into heptameric pore structure Protein Sci. 2011; 20 :448-456 Google Scholar ; Yamashita et al., 2011 71. Yamashita, K. ∙ Kawai, Y. ∙ Tanaka, Y. ... Crystal structure of the octameric pore of staphylococcal γ-hemolysin reveals the β-barrel pore formation mechanism by two components Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :17314-17319 Google Scholar , 2014 72. Yamashita, D. ∙ Sugawara, T. ∙ Takeshita, M. ... Molecular basis of transmembrane beta-barrel formation of staphylococcal pore-forming toxins Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4897 Google Scholar ). The overall architecture of the Epx4 pore resembles that of Hla, comprised of a cap domain formed by the core β-sandwich region ( Figures 2 A and 2B), a rim domain with patches of aromatic residues that likely contact cell membranes ( Figure 2 C), and a stem domain forming a transmembrane β-barrel pore, with an estimated diameter of ∼18 Å ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The cap, rim, and stem domains of the Epx4 protomer are structurally similar to the protomers of Hla (PDB: 7AHL ) ( Song et al., 1996 52. Song, L. ∙ Hobaugh, M.R. ∙ Shustak, C. ... Structure of staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin, a heptameric transmembrane pore Science. 1996; 274 :1859-1866 Google Scholar ), with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) at 1.415 Å ( Figures 2 D and 2E). However, the octameric configuration of Epx4 pore has not been reported for a single component β-barrel PFT.
An unexpected feature of the Epx4 pore is the formation of a second β barrel that sits on top of the cap region ( Figures 2 A–2E). We termed it the “top domain,” which is formed by a β hairpin located at the N terminus of each protomer (residues 34–61; Figures 2 D and S2 ). The diameter of this top domain is similar to that of the transmembrane β-barrel pore. The top domain, the cap region, and the stem β-barrel pore form a continuous channel, with the top domain extending the channel by 28 Å ( Figures 2 E and 2F).
Among Epxs, we observed that Epx1 spontaneously formed SDS-resistant oligomers in solution ( Figure S3 G). We took advantage of this feature and conducted single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of soluble Epx1 oligomers ( Figures 3 A and S4 ), which revealed assembled octameric pores, allowing us to determine a 2.9 Å structure, as well as intermediate assemblies ( Figures 3 A and S4 C; Table S4 ). The overall architecture is similar to that of the Epx4 pore ( Figures 3 B, 3C, S5 A, and S5B), with an RMSD of 0.83 Å ( Figure 3 D), except that the bottom third of the β-barrel pore of Epx1 was not visible in cryo-EM maps (residues 176–184; Figures 3 B and 3C). This is reminiscent to the pre-pore state for γ-hemolysin and leukocidin toxins in solution ( Yamashita et al., 2014 72. Yamashita, D. ∙ Sugawara, T. ∙ Takeshita, M. ... Molecular basis of transmembrane beta-barrel formation of staphylococcal pore-forming toxins Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4897 Google Scholar ), in which a pore-like configuration is assembled but the last third of the β barrel remains disordered ( Figure S5 C).
To further confirm that Epx1 forms functional pores, we analyzed the conductance properties of Epx1 on planar lipid bilayers through single-channel electrophysiological recordings. Multiple stepwise pore-forming events were observed ( Figures S3 H–S3J). The conductance of the pore varied linearly with the applied potential and did not show rectification ( Figure S3 K). The conductance (290 ± 20 pS) in combination with the estimated length of the pore based on our structure suggests a pore diameter of ∼2.1 ± 0.1 nm.
The structures of Epx1 and Epx4 revealed extensive inter-protomer interactions mediated by charged residues within their top domains ( Figure 3 E). Mutations at two charged residues (K50E and K50E/K54E in Epx1 and K51E and K51E/K57E in Epx4) in the top domain, which does not alter the overall conformation of Epx proteins measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy ( Figure S5 D), reduced the efficacy of forming SDS-resistant oligomers ( Figure S5 E) and toxicity on HeLa cells ( Figure 3 F). Similarly, mutating analogous residues (K50E and K50E/K56E) in Epx2 disrupted formation of SDS-resistant oligomers ( Figures S5 D and S5E) and abolished toxicity on HeLa cells ( Figure 3 F).
Structure-based sequence alignments suggest that the top domain of Epxs corresponds to the N-terminal latch domain ( Figure S2 ), which has been suggested to play a role in inter-protomer interactions ( Huyet et al., 2013 23. Huyet, J. ∙ Naylor, C.E. ∙ Savva, C.G. ... Structural Insights into Clostridium perfringens Delta Toxin Pore Formation PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e66673 Google Scholar ; Sugawara et al., 2015 57. Sugawara, T. ∙ Yamashita, D. ∙ Kato, K. ... Structural basis for pore-forming mechanism of staphylococcal α-hemolysin Toxicon. 2015; 108 :226-231 Google Scholar ), in other Hla family members. Epx members share a conserved overall length and number of charged residues within this region, whereas Hla has a large gap within this region, missing 14 of the 30 residues ( Figure S2 ).
We next focused on identification of cellular receptors for Epx2 using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens, as this toxin showed different toxicity levels across a range of cell lines ( Figure S3 D). A genome-wide single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library (GeCKO-v2) was transduced in HeLa cells that stably express Cas9 ( Figure S6 A) ( Sanjana et al., 2014 48. Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Shalem, O. ∙ Zhang, F.

Genome-wide CRISPR screens for Shiga toxins and ricin reveal Golgi proteins critical for glycosylation PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 :e2006951 Google Scholar ). Cells were selected with increasing concentrations of Epx2 ( Figure 4 A). The top hit is β-2-microglobulin ( B2M ) ( Figures 4 B and S6 B). Other hits included sorting nexin-17 ( SNX17 ) and G antigen 1 ( GAGE1 ) ( Figure 4 B).
B2M is a small protein (119 residues) that serves as the β chain of MHC-I ( Bjorkman et al., 1987 6. Bjorkman, P.J. ∙ Saper, M.A. ∙ Samraoui, B. ... Structure of the human class I histocompatibility antigen, HLA-A2 Nature. 1987; 329 :506-512 Google Scholar ; Neefjes et al., 2011 35. Neefjes, J. ∙ Jongsma, M.L. ∙ Paul, P. ... Towards a systems understanding of MHC class I and MHC class II antigen presentation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 :823-836 Google Scholar ; Pamer and Cresswell, 1998 38. Pamer, E. ∙ Cresswell, P. Mechanisms of MHC class I--restricted antigen processing Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16 :323-358 Google Scholar ; Wieczorek et al., 2017 69. Wieczorek, M. ∙ Abualrous, E.T. ∙ Sticht, J. ... Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I and MHC Class II Proteins: Conformational Plasticity in Antigen Presentation Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :292 Google Scholar ). B2M binds to a polymorphic α-chain protein to form MHC/HLA-I complexes ( Figure 4 C). There are three major α-chain genes ( HLA-A , -B , and -C ) and three minor α-chain genes ( HLA-E , -F , and -G ) in humans ( Neefjes et al., 2011 35. Neefjes, J. ∙ Jongsma, M.L. ∙ Paul, P. ... Towards a systems understanding of MHC class I and MHC class II antigen presentation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 :823-836 Google Scholar ; Wieczorek et al., 2017 69. Wieczorek, M. ∙ Abualrous, E.T. ∙ Sticht, J. ... Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I and MHC Class II Proteins: Conformational Plasticity in Antigen Presentation Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :292 Google Scholar ). HLA-A was also identified in our screen ( Figure 4 B). All of these α chains, which are composed of a single transmembrane domain with an extracellular region divided into three domains (α1–3), need to form a heterodimer with B2M ( Figure 4 C). Binding of B2M is critical for proper trafficking of MHC/HLA-I onto cell surfaces; thus, a lack of B2M would block cell surface expression of all MHC/HLA-I complexes.
To validate the top hits, we generated stable knockout (KO) HeLa cells lacking B2M, HLA-A, SNX17, or GAGE1. B2M KO cells showed over 13,000-fold reduction in sensitivity to Epx2 compared with wild-type (WT) HeLa cells ( Figures 4 D and 4E). HLA-A KO cells showed ∼14-fold reduced sensitivity to Epx2 ( Figure 4 E). SNX17 and GAGE1 showed slight reduction in sensitivity but did not reach statistical significance ( Figure S6 C). In addition, B2M KO cells also became resistant to Epx3, whereas their sensitivity to Epxs1 and 4 was not changed ( Figures 4 F and S6 D–S6F).
We also tested three human cancer cell lines, with two (U2OS and Daudi cells) that did not express detectable levels of B2M and one (U937 cells) that has B2M levels higher than HeLa cells ( Figure 4 G). U937 showed an IC 50 value of 0.2 ng/mL for Epx2 and 6 ng/mL for Epx3, ∼70- to 200-fold more sensitive than HeLa cells, whereas U2OS and Daudi cells had IC 50 values of over 13 μg/mL with Epxs2, 3, and 4 ( Figures 4 H, 4I, and S6 K).
We generated Epxs2 and 3 proteins fused with a glutathione S -transferase (GST) tag at their N-termini. By detecting the GST tag, we found that GST-Epx2 and -Epx3 did not bind to B2M KO cells ( Figures 4 J and S6 L). Furthermore, endogenous B2M and HLA-A in HeLa cell lysates could be pulled down by GST-Epx2 and -Epx3, while GST-Epx4 showed no binding ( Figure 4 K).
To determine whether toxins recognize B2M alone, HLA alone, or the heterodimer complex, we expressed B2M, B2M fused with an antigen peptide, HLA-A, B2M fused with HLA-A, and B2M plus a peptide fused with HLA-A in HEK293 cells ( Figure 5 A). GST-Epx2 and -Epx3 pulled down HLA complexes, with or without the fused peptide, but not B2M alone or HLA-A alone from cell lysates ( Figure 5 B). GST-Epx2 and -Epx3 pulled down B2M-HLA-B and B2M-HLA-C complexes as well, but not HLA-B or HLA-C alone ( Figure 5 C). Consistent with these results, GST-Epx2 did not interact with purified B2M in pull-down assays ( Figure S7 A).
We next assayed for direct binding of GST-Epx2 to biotinylated HLA-I complex using biolayer interferometry ( Figure 5 D). GST-Epx2 did not bind to biotinylated neonatal Fc receptor complex (FcRn), despite FcRn containing B2M as a subunit ( Figure 5 D) ( Simister and Mostov, 1989 51. Simister, N.E. ∙ Mostov, K.E. An Fc receptor structurally related to MHC class I antigens Nature. 1989; 337 :184-187 Google Scholar ). The binding affinity between GST-Epx2 and HLA-I complex is weak, with a K D (dissociation constant) in the micromolar range ( Figures S7 B and S7C). It is possible that a proper membrane environment and multi-valent interactions are required for high-affinity binding of Epx2 on cell surfaces.
Epx2 had low activity on murine cells ( Figure S3 E). Human and murine B2M and α-subunit share ∼86% and ∼65% sequence identity, respectively. To assess the potential species selectivity, human, murine, equine, bovine, and porcine versions of MHC-I α-subunit fused with their own B2M were expressed in HEK293 cells ( Figure 5 E). GST-tagged Epx2 and Epx3 pulled down human, equine, bovine, and porcine MHC-I, but not murine MHC-I ( Figure 5 E).
To further map the toxin binding site, we swapped domains between mouse MHC-I and HLA-I. The α1 and α2 domains of the HLA α-subunit form the peptide presentation site, and the α3 domain is next to the transmembrane domain ( Figure 5 F). We switched α1-α2, α3, and B2M between human and mouse versions ( Figure 5 F). Pull-down assays indicated that B2M does not contain the toxin binding site. Instead, the binding site for Epx2 is located on the α1-α2 region of the HLA/MHC-I α-subunit ( Figure 5 G).
Expression of HLA/MHC-I is known to be greatly elevated by interferons (primarily IFN-γ, but also by IFN-α and -β) as part of the immune response to viral and bacterial pathogens ( Fellous et al., 1982 15. Fellous, M. ∙ Nir, U. ∙ Wallach, D. ... Interferon-dependent induction of mRNA for the major histocompatibility antigens in human fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79 :3082-3086 Google Scholar ; Gough et al., 2012 21. Gough, D.J. ∙ Messina, N.L. ∙ Clarke, C.J. ... Constitutive type I interferon modulates homeostatic balance through tonic signaling Immunity. 2012; 36 :166-174 Google Scholar ). We thus compared the sensitivity of three human cell lines (HeLa, Huh7, and U2OS) and three murine cell lines (BMDM, CT26, and Raw) to Epxs with and without pre-treatment of IFN-γ. As expected, HLA/MHC-I levels were elevated after exposure to IFN-γ ( Figure 6 A). This increase rendered Huh7 cells ∼70-fold and U2OS cells >2700-fold more sensitive to Epx2 and Huh7 cells 61-fold and U2OS cells ∼118-fold more sensitive to Epx3 ( Figures 6 B, 6D, S7 D, and S7E). The sensitivity of HeLa cells was also increased to Epx2 and Epx3 after exposure to IFN-γ ( Figures 6 B and 6D). The sensitivities of these cells to Epx4 remain unchanged ( Figures 6 D, S7 F, and S7G). Three murine cell lines showed no changes in their sensitivity to Epx2 and Epx4 but had increased sensitivity to Epx3 after IFN-γ treatment ( Figures 6 C, 6D, S7 E, and S7G). Consistent with these results, GST-Epx2 was able to pull down B2M from HeLa cells, but not from BMDM ( Figure 6 E), whereas Epx3 was still able to weakly pull down murine MHC-I ( Figure 6 E).
To characterize the toxicity of Epx2 and Epx3 on primary cells, we first tested primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mouse lung endothelial cells (mECs). IFN-γ treatment increased B2M levels in HUVECs and mECs ( Figure 6 F). After IFN-γ treatment, the IC 50 value of Epx2 with HUVECs decreased from 3.2 μg/mL to 4.2 ng/mL (819 fold), and the IC 50 value of Epx3 with HUVECs decreased from 268 μg/mL to 75 ng/mL (>3,500 fold) ( Figures 6 G, 6H, and S7 H). Epx2 showed no change in toxicity on mECs after IFN-γ treatment ( Figures 6 G and 6H). mECs showed an increase in sensitivity to Epx3 after IFN-γ treatment, although the overall level of sensitivity remained low ( Figure S7 H). The sensitivities of HUVECs and mECs to Epx4 were not changed after IFN-γ treatment ( Figures 6 H and S7 I).
We next examined human intestinal organoids ( Figure 6 I). Intestinal organoids were sensitive to Epx2 and Epx3 even without IFN-γ treatment (IC 50 of 277 ng/mL for Epx2 and 323 ng/mL for Epx3; Figures 6 J–6M), and exposure to IFN-γ further enhanced their sensitivity (6 ng/mL for Epx2 and 21 ng/mL for Epx3) ( Figure 6 M). Human organoids were not sensitive to Epx4 (IC 50 at 104 μg/mL) with or without IFN-γ treatment ( Figures 6 M and S7 J).
To investigate whether Epx toxins produced by Enterococcus contribute to virulence for human cells, we focused on the Epx2-carrying E. faecium strain DIV0147 as a representative. A closely related strain, DIV0391, which shares ∼98.9% DNA sequence identity with DIV0147 but does not have an epx2 gene, was utilized as a control. Furthermore, we produced a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Epx2, which can neutralize Epx2 toxicity on HeLa cells ( Figure 7 A). It did not cross react with Epxs1, 3, or 4 and had no effect on Epx3 toxicity on HeLa cells ( Figures S7 K and S7L).
Mass spectrometry analysis detected Epx2 directly in the supernatant of DIV0147 ( Figure S7 M). The concentrated supernatant of DIV0147 induced death of HeLa cells, whereas the supernatant of the control DIV0391 strain showed no toxicity. The toxicity of DIV0147 supernatant was neutralized by the Epx2 antibody ( Figure 7 B). We note that we had to concentrate the supernatant in order to detect toxins, indicating that toxin production is suppressed under lab culture conditions.
We then investigated co-culture of E. faecium bacteria with human cell lines (HeLa and U937 cells). Co-culture with DIV0147 for 6 h resulted in death of all cells, whereas cell viability was not affected by co-culture with the control strain ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Adding the Epx2 antibody into the medium eliminated toxicity ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Furthermore, DIV0147 showed no toxicity when co-cultured with B2M KO HeLa cells ( Figure 7 E). These results demonstrate that Epx2 is solely responsible for the toxicity exhibited by DIV0147 on human cell lines.
Immune suppression is a major function of many PFTs. Indeed, co-culture with DIV0147 damaged freshly isolated human PBMCs as measured by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, whereas the control strain showed no toxicity ( Figure 7 F). Adding a polyclonal Epx2 antibody neutralized the toxicity of DIV0147.
Disruption of epithelial barriers is another common function of PFTs. We cultured human intestinal organoids as monolayers in trans -wells ( Figure 7 G). We then carried out co-culture experiments by adding E. faecium into the upper compartment of the trans -well. Co-culture with DIV0147 for 8 h damaged intestinal organoid monolayers as measured by LDH release assays and disrupted cell-cell junctions as detected by increased leakage of a dextran-conjugated dye from the upper compartment into the lower compartment of the trans -well ( Figure 7 G). The control strain had no toxicity, and adding Epx2 antibody eliminated DIV0147 toxicity completely ( Figure 7 G).

Section: Discussion

Traits that exacerbate human infection often evolve and emerge from natural reservoirs outside of humans and historically were often not recognized until they spread into human populations. The genomic era now provides us with a powerful way to identify new potential threats to human health. With their highly malleable genomes ( Paulsen et al., 2003 40. Paulsen, I.T. ∙ Banerjei, L. ∙ Myers, G.S. ... Role of mobile DNA in the evolution of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis Science. 2003; 299 :2071-2074 Google Scholar ), enterococci can serve as a hub for inter-species gene transfer, such as the transmission of vancomycin resistance to methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus ( Weigel et al., 2003 68. Weigel, L.M. ∙ Clewell, D.B. ∙ Gill, S.R. ... Genetic analysis of a high-level vancomycin-resistant isolate of Staphylococcus aureus Science. 2003; 302 :1569-1571 Google Scholar ). Unlike many other Gram-positive pathogens in the genera Streptococcus , Staphylococcus , and Clostridium , toxins targeting human and animal cells are rare in enterococci. We previously identified a botulinum neurotoxin-like toxin in a single E. faecium strain, but the targeted host species remains unknown for this toxin ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, S. ∙ Lebreton, F. ∙ Mansfield, M.J. ... Identification of a Botulinum Neurotoxin-like Toxin in a Commensal Strain of Enterococcus faecium Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :169-176.e6 Google Scholar ). Here, we identified and characterized a family of β-barrel PFTs in enterococci, with members highly toxic to human cells. The widespread geographical distribution, the diversity of hosts, and the clear evidence for multiple independent introductions into distinct species all suggest that acquisition of this family of toxins is not a rare event and likely confers competitive advantages.
Our functional characterizations reveal the pathogenic potential of toxin-harboring E. faecium and suggest a key role of Epx2 in immune suppression and epithelial barrier disruption during pathogenesis. Besides humans, Epx2 and Epx3 can also recognize the MHC-I of major agricultural animals including horses, cattle, and pigs, which may serve as natural reservoirs for enterococci harboring these potent toxins. Considering that MDR hospital-adapted E. faecium strains co-evolved with animal populations as they spread into humans ( Lebreton et al., 2013 29. Lebreton, F. ∙ van Schaik, W. ∙ McGuire, A.M. ... Emergence of epidemic multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium from animal and commensal strains MBio. 2013; 4 e00534–e00513 Google Scholar ), expansion of Epxs into strains of hospital-adapted lineages has the potential to be a devastating development.
By switching domains between human HLA-I and murine MHC-I, we were able to map the binding site for Epx2 to α1-α2 domains of MHC-I, which are the polymorphic domains containing the peptide binding site for antigen presentation and the region engaging the T cell receptor. Binding appears to be mediated by conserved regions on α1-α2, since Epx2 can bind to all three HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C forms. Interestingly, superantigens, another class of bacterial toxins such as S. aureus toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 recognize the polymorphic α1 domain of MHC-II ( Jardetzky et al., 1994 24. Jardetzky, T.S. ∙ Brown, J.H. ∙ Gorga, J.C. ... Three-dimensional structure of a human class II histocompatibility molecule complexed with superantigen Nature. 1994; 368 :711-718 Google Scholar ; Karp et al., 1990 25. Karp, D.R. ∙ Teletski, C.L. ∙ Scholl, P. ... The alpha 1 domain of the HLA-DR molecule is essential for high-affinity binding of the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 Nature. 1990; 346 :474-476 Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 1994 27. Kim, J. ∙ Urban, R.G. ∙ Strominger, J.L. ... Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 complexed with a class II major histocompatibility molecule HLA-DR1 Science. 1994; 266 :1870-1874 Google Scholar ), which is also the domain containing the peptide binding site and engaging the T cell receptor. Determining the structure of an Epx2-MHC-I complex will be required to elucidate the mechanism of toxin-receptor recognition.
MHC-I is expressed on all nucleated cells, but not on red blood cells. It presents peptide antigens derived from cytosolic proteins degraded by proteasomes. Recognition of foreign or mutated peptide antigens by CD8 + T cells then induces cell death to eliminate infected or cancerous cells ( Neefjes et al., 2011 35. Neefjes, J. ∙ Jongsma, M.L. ∙ Paul, P. ... Towards a systems understanding of MHC class I and MHC class II antigen presentation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 :823-836 Google Scholar ; Wieczorek et al., 2017 69. Wieczorek, M. ∙ Abualrous, E.T. ∙ Sticht, J. ... Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I and MHC Class II Proteins: Conformational Plasticity in Antigen Presentation Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :292 Google Scholar ). The level of MHC-I is greatly increased by interferons under inflammatory conditions. IFN-γ plays a critical role in regulating both innate and adaptive host responses to not only viral infections but also to a variety of bacterial pathogens such as S. aureus , Salmonella typhimurium , Listeria monocytogenes , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Shtrichman and Samuel, 2001 50. Shtrichman, R. ∙ Samuel, C.E. The role of gamma interferon in antimicrobial immunity Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4 :251-259 Google Scholar ). Interestingly, commensal microbes such as Bacteroidetes induce and maintain a low level of IFN-β production from colonic dendritic cells ( Abt et al., 2012 1. Abt, M.C. ∙ Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ... Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity Immunity. 2012; 37 :158-170 Google Scholar ; Stefan et al., 2020 55. Stefan, K.L. ∙ Kim, M.V. ∙ Iwasaki, A. ... Commensal Microbiota Modulation of Natural Resistance to Virus Infection Cell. 2020; 183 :1312-1324.e10 Google Scholar ), which primes intestinal tissues in a vigilant state against potential viral infections. Finally, Epx2 and Epx3 are potential tools to induce death of virally infected cells and cancerous cells in humans in an IFN-dependent manner.
The pathogenic potential of Epx-harboring bacteria and the role of Epxs remain to be investigated and validated in vivo in animal infection models. A major technical limitation is that mice and rats are not suitable models, as Epx2 does not recognize murine MHC-I. Whether Epxs and the bacteria that produce them cause, or will cause, any human or animal diseases remains a major question to be investigated. Epx1 and Epx4 did not show high levels of toxicity on cell lines we have tested. This is likely because these cells do not have their receptors. We cannot exclude the possibility that Epxs assembled as active pores on cell membranes could differ from the structures of Epx1 and Epx4 we obtained in solution in this study, and future studies resolving the pore structure in lipid membranes will be important.

Strain E. faecalis 257EA1 is derived from commercial chicken meat as reported ( Manson et al., 2019 33. Manson, A.L. ∙ Van Tyne, D. ∙ Straub, T.J. ... Chicken Meat-Associated Enterococci: Influence of Agricultural Antibiotic Use and Connection to the Clinic Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2019; 85 e01559–e01519 Google Scholar ). E. faecium DIV0147 was recovered from presumptive horse feces on a remote trail in Montana, USA. Culture of enterococci and purification, short read sequencing, assembly, and annotation of genomic DNA were performed essentially as described ( Manson et al., 2019 33. Manson, A.L. ∙ Van Tyne, D. ∙ Straub, T.J. ... Chicken Meat-Associated Enterococci: Influence of Agricultural Antibiotic Use and Connection to the Clinic Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2019; 85 e01559–e01519 Google Scholar ). E. faecium DIV0391 was isolated from crow feces in Berlin, Germany (GenBank: GCA_002141075.1)
The enterococcal diversity project is an ongoing collaboration between M.S.G. (Harvard Medical School) and A.M.E. (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard), with the goal of surveying the global diversity of Enterococcus to understand the biological basis for host association and antibiotic resistance transmission through comparative genomics.
Long read sequencing was performed using an Oxford Nanopore MinION MkI (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Hybrid assembly of these reads with quality-trimmed 2 × 150bp NextSeq Illumina reads was then performed using SPAdes 3.8.0 with default options, except for–nanopore–only-assembler–k 25,35,45,55,65,75. Scaffolds < 1000 bp were removed from the assembly. Epx1 and Epx2 were first discovered using a systematic analysis of enterococcal proteins of unknown function using the protein modeling and prediction tool (default parameter) Phyre2 ( Kelley et al., 2015 26. Kelley, L.A. ∙ Mezulis, S. ∙ Yates, C.M. ... The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :845-858 Google Scholar ), which revealed structural homology to S. aureus leukocidin and beta and delta toxins from C. perfringens . Epx3 to 8 were discovered using blastp with Epx 1 and 3 as query sequences against the nr database with default parameters (BLOSUM62, gap existence = 11, gap extension = 1, with conditional compositional score matrix adjustment). Epx sequences representing all major types (1-8) were aligned in a multiple alignment using ClustalO (v1.2.1), then pairwise identity between all toxins was calculated in a 50-amino-acid sliding window across the length of the multiple alignment with a step of 1.
The 16S rRNA based phylogeny for the Enterococcus genus was extracted from the All-Species Living Tree project and edited using iTOL ( Letunic and Bork, 2016 31. Letunic, I. ∙ Bork, P. Interactive tree of life (iTOL) v3: an online tool for the display and annotation of phylogenetic and other trees Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 W242–245 Google Scholar ). The core genome, SNP-based phylogenetic tree of E. faecalis , E. faecium , and E. hirae , was constructed using RAxML and a concatenated alignment of 1513, 1144 and 1891 single-copy core orthogroups, respectively. The 1000 bootstrap iterations were calculated using the rapid bootstrapping algorithm of RAxML. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes and plasmid predictions were determined using available online tools (PlasmidFinder and Resfinder https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services ). Plasmid sequences were compared and visualized as a circular alignment using CGView ( Stothard et al., 2019 56. Stothard, P. ∙ Grant, J.R. ∙ Van Domselaar, G. Visualizing and comparing circular genomes using the CGView family of tools Brief. Bioinform. 2019; 20 :1576-1582 Google Scholar ).

The Huh7 cell line was provided by Y. Matsuura. The BMDM cell line was provided by Susan Carpenter. The S2 cell line was originally obtained from DGRC (RRID:CVCL_Z831). HUVECs were from pooled donors and purchased from Lonza. Anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (M2) and anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (AC-15) were purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody against GST (8-326) was purchased from Thermo Fisher. Mouse monoclonal antibody against HLA Class 1 ABC (ab70328) and rabbit monoclonal antibody against B2M (ab75853) were purchased from Abcam.
The full-length genes of Epxs were synthesized by Genewiz. The constructs for expressing Epxs and GST-Epxs were generated by sub-cloning Epx1 (residues 24-345), Epx2 (residues 30-334), Epx3 (residues 24-329), and Epx4 (residues 32-335) into the pET22b (Addgene, 69744-3) vector with a C-terminal His6 tag or the pGEX4T1 (Addgene, 27458001) vector with a N-terminal GST tag. Mutant Epxs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. The cDNAs of HLA-I were originally obtained from GE Dharmacon: B2M (MHS6278-202758740); HLA-A (MHS6278-202757462); HLA-B (MHS6278-202804742) and HLA-C (MHS1010-202726224). The full-length genes of murine, equine, bovine, and porcine B2M and MHC-I α-subunit genes were synthesized by Twist Bioscience. The full-length B2M, full-length HLA, and B2M-HLA fusion constructs (full length B2M with linker (GGGGS) x 3 fused with HLA-A (residues 25-365), HLA-B (residues 25-362), or HLA-C (residues 25-366), with an additional human Fc tag or a triple-FLAG tag at their C-termini (with EFGSGSGS linker)) were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, V800-20) via Gibson Assembly (NEB, E2621). The representative antigen peptide (HER2 residues 63-71, TYLPTNASL) and the linker (GGGGS) x 3 were synthesized and inserted into the B2M-HLA fusion constructs via Gibson Assembly. The human and mouse HLA/MHC chimeric proteins were constructed as follows: mhhh (mB2M - (GGGGS) × 3 – hHLA no signal (25-365)), hhhm (hB2M - (GGGGS) × 3 - hHLA-A α1+α2 (25-206) - mH2K α3+TM (205-369)), mhhm (mB2M - (GGGGS) × 3 - hHLA-A α1+α2 (25-206) - mH2K α3+TM (205-369)), mmmh (mB2M - (GGGGS) × 3 - mH2K α1+α2 (22-203) - hHLA-A α3+TM (207-365)), hmmh (hB2M - (GGGGS) × 3 - mH2K α1+α2 (22-203) - hHLA-A α3+TM (207-365)), hmmm (hB2M - (GGGGS) × 3 - mH2K no signal (22-369)), with an EFGSGSGS linker and a triple-FLAG tag at their C-termini. These constructs were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector via Gibson Assembly.
Epxs were expressed recombinantly with either a C-terminal His6 tag in the pET22b vector or N-terminal GST tag in pGEX4T1 vector in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) at 20°C for 16 h using autoinduction medium (ForMedium AIMLB0210). Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in protein purification buffer (PP buffer) containing 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and then lysed by sonication and centrifugation. For GST-tagged proteins, bacterial lysates were applied to GSTrap columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PP buffer. After washing with PP buffer, bound proteins were eluted using PP buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 7.5. For His6 tagged proteins, bacterial lysates were applied to HisTrap (GE Healthcare) nickel columns equilibrated with PP buffer, and columns were washed with PP buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted using PP buffer with a linear imidazole gradient from 20 mM to 500 mM. The proteins were further purified through HiTrap Q ion-exchange and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration columns using the buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5. Proteins were concentrated using Vivaspin protein concentrator column (GE Healthcare) to ∼10 mg/mL.
Cells were plated in 96-well microplates overnight to ∼70% confluence and then exposed to 2-fold serial dilutions of toxins in medium for 4 h at 37°C. MTT (0.5 mg/mL, Research Products International M92050) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. A total of 100 μL solubilization solution (10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl) was then added to each well, incubated overnight at room temperature, and the absorbance of formazan was then measured at 580 nm using a microplate reader (BMG Labtech, FLUOstar Omega). A vehicle control without toxins was analyzed in parallel. The cell viability curves were analyzed and fitted using Origin software (version 8.5). The toxin concentration that induced 50% of cells to lose viability is defined as the IC 50 value. Data were represented as mean ± SD from three independent biological replicates. Data were considered significant when p -value < 0.01 (Student’s t test, double-tail). Statistical analysis was performed using Excel.
Liposomes were produced using POPC: PE: cholesterol at a molar ratio of 4:3:3 (Avanti polar lipids). Briefly, these lipids were dried and then rehydrated in PBS buffer together with 10 mM sulforhodamine B, incubated for 30 min at 37°C, followed by vigorous vertexing. The suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by thawing at 37°C for 5 rounds. The lipid suspension was then extruded through a 100 nm pore filter 21 times to produce liposomes, which then went through G25 desalting column to remove free dyes. The dye leakage assay was carried out by mixing toxins with 80 μL liposomes and incubating at 37°C. Sulforhodamine B release was measured every 20 s with excitation/emission wavelengths at 545/590 nm. The detergent Triton X-100 (4%, v/v) was utilized to break all liposomes to quantify the maximal signal of sulforhodamine B, which is set as 100% leakage.
Liposome-bound Epx2 samples were prepared by mixing liposome containing POPC: PE: cholesterol at a molar ratio of 4:3:3 with 2 μM Epx2 at 37°C for 30 min. We placed formvar-carbon coated grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with carbon side up in the Glow Discharge System at 30 mA for 30 s. 10 μL of liposome-bound Epx2 was then applied to freshly glow-discharged grid, incubated for 30 s, washed twice with H 2 O and blotted by touching filter paper. The samples were then negatively stained with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 min and air-dried. The grids were then imaged using a Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN electron microscope and recorded with an AMT 2k CCD camera (Harvard Medical School Electron Microscopy Facility).
20 μL of Epxs (25 μM) proteins were mixed with 80 μL of liposomes containing POPC: PE: cholesterol at a molar ratio of 4:3:3. The mixtures were then incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Liposome-bound Epxs were solubilized using 20 μL of protein loading buffer (375 mM Tris-HCl, 9% SDS 50% glycerol, and 0.03% bromophenol blue). Samples were analyzed by 4%–20% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining to detect SDS-resistant oligomerization bands.
Planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology experiments were carried out using MECA chips (50 μm) on an Orbit Mini apparatus (Nanion). The lipid bilayer was painted with 50% DPhPc, 30% DOPE, and 20% DOPS at 5 mg/mL in n-octane. Purified Epx1 was added at 1 μg/mL. Once pore-formation events were detected, excess Epx1 was slowly removed by buffer exchange using a perfusion system (Eastern Scientific LLC). Experiments were carried out in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 100 mM NaCl and recorded at 1.25 kHz, filtered at 625 Hz and analyzed in Clampfit 10. Average channel currents were derived from three independent measurements.
Pore size was calculated using the equation: 1 γ = ( l + 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑟 2 ) ⁢ 𝜌 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑟 2 ,
where γ is the pore conductance, r is the radius, l is the length of the pore (10 nm), and ρ is the resistivity of the buffer (100 Ω·cm).
Purified wild-type Epxs and mutants were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL in PBS. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 20°C using an Applied Photo-physics Chirascan plus spectropolarimeter (Jasco J-815) with a 1 mm path-length cell and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Spectra were scanned from 190 to 260 nm with a step-size of 1 nm and were repeated five times. Each reported circular dichroism curve was the average of five scans. Protein concentrations were determined with their 280 nm absorbance.
Crystallization was performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 4°C by mixing equal volumes (0.2–1.0 μL) of Epx4 with the reservoir solution. Crystals were grown in 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8,000, 40% (v/v) MPD, 0.1 M Sodium Cacodylate, pH 6.5. Crystals were briefly soaked in cryoprotectant solution containing reservoir solution supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection at the Advanced Photon Source using Northeastern Collaborative Access Team (NE-CAT) beamlines 24-ID-C and 24-ID-E.
All diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and merged using HKL2000 ( Otwinowski and Minor, 1997 37. Otwinowski, Z. ∙ Minor, W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 :307-326 Google Scholar ). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP ( Vagin and Teplyakov, 2010 63. Vagin, A. ∙ Teplyakov, A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :22-25 Google Scholar ) with the delta toxin structure (PDB ID: 2YGT ) ( Huyet et al., 2013 23. Huyet, J. ∙ Naylor, C.E. ∙ Savva, C.G. ... Structural Insights into Clostridium perfringens Delta Toxin Pore Formation PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e66673 Google Scholar ) as the search model. Structural refinement was carried out using PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Google Scholar ), and iterative model building was performed in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 14. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Google Scholar ). Structural figures were generated using the PyMOL ( https://www.pymol.org:443/ ) program. Detailed data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table S3 .
A 4 μL drop of Epx1 protein at 1 mg/mL was applied to a glow-discharged Quantifoil grid (R 1.2/1.3 400 mesh, copper, Electron Microscopy Sciences) and blotted once for 6 s after a wait time of 15 s in 100% humidity at 4°C and plunged into liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Cryo-EM datasets were collected at 300 kV on a Titan Krios microscope (FEI) at the Harvard Cryo-Electron Microscopy Center for Structural Biology. Movies (50 frames, each 0.04 s, total dose 53.54 e/Å 2 ) were recorded using a K3 detector (Gatan) with a defocus range of −1.5 to −2.5 μm. Automated single-particle data acquisition was performed with SerialEM, with a nominal magnification of 105,000 × in counting mode, which yielded a calibrated pixel size of 0.825 Å.
Raw movies were motion-corrected using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 77. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Google Scholar ) and combined into micrographs, yielding 4,920 Epx1 micrographs used for image processing. The defocus value for each micrograph was determined using Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 75. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Google Scholar ). 1,963,299 particles were boxed using crYOLO ( Wagner et al., 2019 66. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Google Scholar ). Chosen particles were extracted from micrographs and binned two times (pixel size 1.65 Å) in RELION 3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 78. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Google Scholar ). 2D classification was performed to discard bad particles. Good class averages were selected for the reconstruction of an initial model in RELION 3.1. 1,680,746 particles were selected for 3D classification. C1 symmetry was used for the first round of 3D classification. 800,275 particles likely representing assembly intermediates (including heptamers) and 150,842 octamer particles were selected for further processing. A round of 3D classification with C8 symmetry was performed to discard bad particles. 119,503 particles were selected for the final reconstruction. With C8 symmetry, the resolution of the Epx1 octamer map is 3.14 Å using the “gold” standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion. After CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, the resolution of the final map improved to 2.87 Å. DeepEMhancer was applied to improve the map’s resolution at the top domain ( Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2021 47. Sanchez-Garcia, R. ∙ Gomez-Blanco, J. ∙ Cuervo, A. ... DeepEMhancer: a deep learning solution for cryo-EM volume post-processing Commun. Biol. 2021; 4 :874 Google Scholar ). The local resolution distribution of the map was determined by ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 28. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Google Scholar ).
To generate an initial model, we docked the Epx4 X-ray crystal structure into the map as a rigid body using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 43. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Google Scholar ). This was followed by iterative model building in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 14. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Google Scholar ). PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Google Scholar ) was used to refine the model by iterative positional and B-factor refinement in real space. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table S4 .
HeLa cells that stably express Cas9 (HeLa-Cas9) were generated using lentivirus (LentiCas9-Blast, Addgene, #52962) and selected using 10 μg/mL blasticidin S (RPI, B12150.01). The GeCKO-V2 sgRNA library was obtained from Addgene (#1000000049). The sub-library A and B were independently packed into lentivirus. HeLa-Cas9 Cells were transduced with sgRNA lentiviral libraries at a MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 0.3. Infected cells were selected with 5 μg/mL puromycin (Thermo Scientific, A1113830) for one week. 3.3 × 10 7 cells for sub-library A or 2.9 × 10 7 cells for sub-library B were plated onto 15-cm culture dishes to ensure enough sgRNA coverage, with each sgRNA being represented 500 times. These cells were either saved as initial library control or exposed to 0.25 μg/mL Epx for 24 h. The surviving cells were washed and re-seeded within toxin-free medium until ∼70% confluence, followed by the next round of selection with 0.5 μg/mL Epx for 24 h. The genomic DNA of surviving cells was extracted using a commercial kit (QIAGEN, 13323). The DNA fragments containing the sgRNA sequences were amplified by PCR using primers lentiGP-1_F (AATGGACTATCATATGCTTACCGTAACTTGAAAGTATTTCG) and lentiGP-3_R (ATGAATACTGCCATTTGTCTCAAGATCTAGTTACGC). Next-generation sequencing was performed by a commercial vendor (Genewiz, Illumina HiSeq). The selected sgRNA sequences (B2M: CAGTAAGTCAACTTCAATGT; HLA-A: TCCCTCCTTACCCCATCTCA; GAGE1: GGGTCCATCTCCTGCCCATC; SNX17: CTTTCAACAGTTTCCTGCGT) were cloned into The LentiGuide-Puro vector (Addgene, #52963). The KO cells were generated via lentiviral transduction of sgRNAs into HeLa-Cas9 cells. Mixed populations of transduced cells were selected with puromycin (5 μg/mL).
Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (Hampton, HR3-239) and exposed to GST-Epx2 or GST-Epx3 (50 μg/mL) on ice for 60 min. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA,w/v) for 20 min, blocked with 10% goat serum for 40 min, followed by incubation with primary antibodies against GST (1:500 dilution) for 1 h and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. Slides were sealed within DAPI-containing mounting medium (SouthernBiotech, 0100-20). Fluorescence images were captured with an Olympus DSU-IX81 spinning disk confocal system. Images were pseudo-colored and analyzed using ImageJ (Version 1.52o).
Cell lysates were harvested in 1 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, plus a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mL per 10-cm dish) and incubated with 20 μg GST-tagged Epx proteins for 4 h at 4°C. Pull-down experiments were carried out using 15 μL glutathione agarose beads, washed, pelleted, and boiled. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, 10600002). The membrane was blocked (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% skim milk) for 40 min, followed by incubation with primary antibodies for 1 h and secondary antibodies for another 1 h, and then analyzed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34080). Blot images were taken using a Fuji LAS3000 imaging system. Images were analyzed using ImageJ (Version 1.52o).
The binding between Epx2 and HLA-I complex was measured using the BLI assay with the BLItz system (ForteBio). Briefly, 10 μg/mL biotin-labeled HLA-I complex (Eagle Biosciences, #1001) or FcRn complex (BPS Bio, #71283) were immobilized onto capture biosensors (Streptavidin (SA) Biosensors, ForteBio) and washed with DPBS containing 0.5% BSA (w/v). Empty biosensors served as a control. These biosensors were then exposed to variable concentrations of GST-Epx2 in solution (GST-Epx2 binding), followed by washing (dissociation) in DPBS (0.5% (w/v) BSA). Binding affinities ( K D ) were estimated using the BLItz software (ForteBio). The experiments were repeated three times.
Human and mouse IFN-γ (StemCell Technologies, Inc., #78141, #78021) powders were dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, and aliquoted and frozen at −20°C. Human and mouse cells were seeded into plates (96-well plates for cell viability assay and 6-well plates for immunoblots) and grew to ∼70% confluence. Human and mouse organoids were seeded in 24-well plates. IFN-γ stock was diluted 10,000-folds into culture medium at a final concentration of 10 ng/mL and cells were incubated with medium containing IFN-γ for 20 h at 37°C. For cell viability assays, Epxs were added directly to IFN-γ-treated cells without changing medium.
HUVECs were purchased from Lonza and cultured in the 0.2% gelatin-coated plates with complete endothelial cell growth media: 40% F-12K medium (Corning), 40% DMEM medium (Corning), 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% home-made bovine brain food, 0.2% Heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, 50mg/mL), 1% penicillin streptomycin (GIBCO), and 0.1% ciprofloxacin (Corning, 12.5 mg/mL). Primary mECs were isolated from the lungs of 8∼10-week-old C57BL/6J mice. Briefly, finely minced lung was digested with enzyme solution (2 mg/mL collagenase I, 5 mg/mL dispase, Roche) at 37°C for 45 min and filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer. The suspended cells were then centrifuged at 1200 rpm at 4°C for 8 min. The cell pellet was resuspended and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. Anti-mouse CD31 MicroBeads (10 μL, Miltenyi Biotec) were added into 10 7 cells in 90 μL of buffer (PBS, pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA, and 2 mM EDTA). The cells were then mixed and incubated for 15 min at 4°C. After incubation, the cells were washed with the buffer described above. Mouse CD31 + endothelial cells were isolated using an MS column and separator (Miltenyi Biotec), and then immediately seeded into pre-coated cell culture plates. Both HUVECs and mECs were used between passages 2 and 5.
Cultured human intestinal organoids were provided as de-identified materials from the organoid core facility at Harvard Digestive Disease Center. These organoids are originally from de-identified endoscopic biopsy samples from pediatric patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy at Boston Children’s Hospital. All methods were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Boston Children’s Hospital (Protocol number IRB-P00000529). To isolate crypts, biopsies were digested in 2 mg/mL of Collagenase Type I (Life Technologies, 17018029) reconstituted in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution for 40 min at 37°C. Samples were then agitated by pipetting followed by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C. The crypts were resuspended in 200-300 μL of Matrigel (Corning, 356231) with 50 μL plated onto 4-6 wells of a 24-well plate and polymerized at 37°C.
Isolated crypts were grown in Matrigel with organoid growth medium, which contains (v/v): L-WRN conditioned media (50%), DMEM/F12 (45%), Glutamax (1%), N-2 supplement (1%), B-27 supplement (1%), HEPES (10 mM), primocin (100 μg/mL), normocin (100 μg/mL), A83-01 (500 nM), N-acetyl-cysteine (500 μM), recombinant murine EGF (50 ng/mL), human [Leu15]-Gastrin I (10 nM), nicotinamide (10 mM), and SB202190 (10 μM). The medium was changed every two days. After 6-8 days of culture, the medium was removed and Cell Recovery Solution (Corning, 354253) was added. The plate was incubated at 4°C for 1 h. The Matrigel was mechanically resuspended and centrifuged at 500 g at 4°C for 5 min. The pelleted organoids were resuspended in fresh Matrigel and mechanically disrupted by pipetting up-and-down. The suspension was seeded into a fresh 24-well plate at 50 μL per well. After incubation at 37°C for 10 min, 500 μL of pre-warmed organoid growth media was added. After 2 days in culture, the organoids were changed to fresh media with IFN-γ and cultured overnight. Then, serial dilutions of toxins were added to the organoids for 4 h treatment. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay.
A mutant inactive form of Epx2 (K50E/K56E, 5 mg) was purified in E. coli and utilized to immunize rabbits following a standard 3-month immunization protocol by a commercial vendor (Boston Molecules Inc., Boston, MA). Final bleeds were collected, and polyclonal antibodies were purified using a protein G column. ELISA assays were carried out to confirm the antibody titer against Epx2 (K50E/K56E). Antibodies purified with a protein G column from naive rabbits were used as the control IgG.
E. faecium DIV0147 and DIV0391 were recovered from glycerol stock and grown overnight in 2 mL BHI medium (Thermo Scientific, CM1135B) 37°C in a shaker, followed by sub-culture (1:200 dilution) in 5 mL BHI medium for 48 h until the O.D. reached ∼2.5. Culture supernatant was collected and concentrated ∼75-fold using a protein concentrator (MilliporeSigma, UFC801008). HeLa cells were cultured in 96-well plates to ∼70% confluence. Concentrated supernatant (20 μl per well) was then added to cell culture medium (100 μl per well) and incubated for 30 min. Cells were then imaged using an Olympus microscope. For antibody neutralization assays, Epx2 antibody or control IgG (1 μg, 1:50 dilution) was added to each well immediately before adding the concentrated supernatant.
E. faecium DIV0147 and DIV0391 were cultured in 5 mL BHI medium for 48 h until the O.D. reached ∼2.5. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates (∼75,000 cells per well) in standard DMEM cell culture medium (Cytiva, #SH30022) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) without antibiotics. A standard curve between O.D. and bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) was generated by serial dilution and plating. Bacterial numbers were then quantified based on this O.D.-CFU standard curve. Bacteria were added to cell culture medium with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) at 800 and cultured together with cells for 6 h at 37°C. Cells were washed with PBS three times and subjected to MTT assays. For antibody neutralization assays, Epx2 antibody or control IgG (2 μg, 1:25 dilution) were added to each well immediately before adding the bacteria.
Fresh human blood was purchased from a commercial vendor (Stemcell Technology, Cambridge, MA, #70508.2). PBMCs were isolated using a kit following supplier’s instructions (Stemcell Technology, Cambridge, MA, #19654). PBMCs were seeded into a 96-well plate (∼150,000 per well) and cultured using RPMI 1640 medium (Cytiva, #SH30027) plus 2% FBS without antibiotics. IFN-γ (StemCell Technologies, Inc., #78141, 10 ng/mL) was added to the medium. Bacteria were added to cell culture medium with a MOI at 800 and cultured together with cells for 4 h at 37°C. Cell culture supernatants were collected and subjected to LDH release assays using a commercial kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Scientific, #C20301). LDH release from 2% Triton X-100 treatment served as a positive control and was used as 100% to normalize other measurements. For antibody neutralization assays, Epx2 antibody or control IgG (2 μg, 1:25 dilution) was added to each well immediately before adding the bacteria.
Human intestinal organoids were obtained and cultured as described above. Trans-wells (Corning, 3470) were pre-coated with 200 μL of 10% Collagen (rat tail collagen type I, 3.90 mg/mL, Corning, 354236) in PBS for 2 h at 37°C followed by rinsing with PBS. To seed a single trans-well, organoids from 2-4 wells of a 24-well plate were recovered from Matrigel by incubation in cell recovery solution (Corning, 354253) for 20 min on ice and pooled. Following centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C, the pellet was resuspended in 1X TriplE Express (GIBCO, #12605-010) for 10 min at 37°C. At the midpoint of this incubation, a bent P1000 tip was used to mechanically disrupt the pellet followed by pipetting up and down 50 times at the conclusion of the incubation. Chilled medium was then added to dilute the TriplE Express followed by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in organoid growth medium at a concentration of ∼1.5-3.0 × 10 5 cells per 200 μL, seeded in pre-coated trans-wells and cultured at 37°C for ∼7 days. Once confluent, monolayers were switched to antibiotic-free media containing 5% FBS, which contains (v/v): L-WRN conditioned media (25%), DMEM/F12 (70%), Glutamax (1%), N-2 supplement (1%), B-27 supplement (1%), HEPES (10 mM), A83-01 (500 nM), N-acetyl-cysteine (500 μM), recombinant murine EGF (50 ng/mL), human [Leu15]-Gastrin I (10 nM), nicotinamide (10 mM), and SB202190 (10 μM).
Cells were then stimulated with IFN-γ (10 ng/mL) for 16 h. Bacterium was added to cell culture medium with MOI at 800 and co-cultured with the cells for 6 h at 37°C. Cell culture supernatant was collected and subjected to LDH release assay. Cells were washed with PBS 3 times and subjected to permeability measurements using Rhodamine-dextran 70 kDa (Sigma, R9379). Briefly, Rhodamine-dextran was dissolved in P buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM glucose, 3 mM CaCl 2 , 145 mM NaCl) or P/EGTA buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM glucose, 145 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA).
To measure the paracellular flux, the upper, and lower cell culture media were replaced with P buffer containing Rhodamine-dextran (1 mg/mL) and P buffer alone, respectively. P/EGTA buffer containing Rhodamine-dextran (1 mg/mL) and P/EGTA buffer were used as positive controls. After incubation for 4 h, the amounts of Rhodamine-dextran in the basolateral media were measured with a fluorometer (excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm). Data are expressed as fluorescent intensity. For antibody neutralization assays, Epx2 antibody or control IgG (2 μg, 1:25 dilution) was added to each well before adding the bacterium.
The concentrated bacterial culture supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. The area around the size of Epx2 was cut into small pieces (about 1mm x 1mm x 1mm). These gel pieces were de-stained with de-staining buffer (25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , 50% ACN), rinsed twice with acetonitrile, dried using speed-vac, then reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Gel pieces were digested with trypsin at 37°C overnight. Digestion was terminated by adding 1 μL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid solution, and peptides were extracted twice with extraction buffer (50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Extracted supernatants were concentrated using speed-vac and desalted with home-made C18 stage-tips. Elution from stage-tips was dried using speed-vac and reconstituted with sample buffer (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Samples were then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.
All quantitative data were analyzed and graphed using OriginPro 9.1 software. All data are represented as mean ± SD calculated using the OriginPro 9.1 software, unless indicated otherwise. Statistical details of the experiments are provided in the respective figure legends and in each methods section pertaining to the specific technique applied.
