Title: Comprehensive In Vivo Interrogation Reveals Phenotypic Impact of Human Enhancer Variants


Abstract: Summary

Establishing causal links between non-coding variants and human phenotypes is an increasing challenge. Here, we introduce a high-throughput mouse reporter assay for assessing the pathogenic potential of human enhancer variants in vivo and examine nearly a thousand variants in an enhancer repeatedly linked to polydactyly. We show that 71% of all rare non-coding variants previously proposed as causal lead to reporter gene expression in a pattern consistent with their pathogenic role. Variants observed to alter enhancer activity were further confirmed to cause polydactyly in knockin mice. We also used combinatorial and single-nucleotide mutagenesis to evaluate the in vivo impact of mutations affecting all positions of the enhancer and identified additional functional substitutions, including potentially pathogenic variants hitherto not observed in humans. Our results uncover the functional consequences of hundreds of mutations in a phenotype-associated enhancer and establish a widely applicable strategy for systematic in vivo evaluation of human enhancer variants.

Section: Introduction

Genome-wide association and whole-genome sequencing studies generate rapidly expanding lists of non-coding variants potentially causing or contributing to human diseases. However, there is a major gap in establishing conclusive links between individual variants and specific phenotypes observed in human patients. Many non-coding variants are hypothesized to affect distant-acting transcriptional enhancers, a predominant class of DNA regulatory sequences that activate the expression of target genes in a cell-type-specific manner ( Furlong and Levine, 2018; Long et al., 2016; Shlyueva et al., 2014; Visel et al., 2009b 15.

Genet. 2019; 51 :1160-1169 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ), but a conclusive demonstration of the pathogenic potential of variants and a mechanistic understanding of their effects generally require the functional assessment of enhancer variants through in vivo experiments. Mouse transgenesis is a powerful system for this purpose, but traditional transgenic approaches have limited throughput and high cost, and so-called “position effects” can complicate the interpretation of results ( Inoue and Ahituv, 2015; Kvon, 2015 22.

In the present study, we developed a highly scalable mouse enhancer-reporter assay named enSERT (enhancer insertion) that relies on site-specific integration of a transgene into the mouse genome and avoids position effects ( Figure 1 A). To demonstrate the utility of enSERT, we systematically interrogated all nucleotides in one of the best-studied human enhancers, the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence (ZRS, also known as MFCS1) ( Lettice et al., 2003 33. Lettice, L.A. ∙ Heaney, S.J.H. ∙ Purdie, L.A. ... A long-range Shh enhancer regulates expression in the developing limb and fin and is associated with preaxial polydactyly Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12 :1725-1735 Crossref Scopus (895) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ZRS is a limb-specific enhancer of the Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) gene and is located at the extreme distance of nearly one million base pairs from its target promoter. The enhancer is active in the posterior margins of developing fore- and hindlimb buds ( Figure 1 B) and is critically required for normal limb development in mice ( Sagai et al., 2005 48. Sagai, T. ∙ Hosoya, M. ∙ Mizushina, Y. ... Elimination of a long-range cis-regulatory module causes complete loss of limb-specific Shh expression and truncation of the mouse limb Development. 2005; 132 :797-803 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). Changes in the ZRS enhancer have been implicated in the evolution of vertebrate appendages ( Kvon et al., 2016; Leal and Cohn, 2016; Letelier et al., 2018 29.

Genet. 2018; 50 :504-509 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). In humans, as well as in several other tetrapods, single nucleotide mutations within the ZRS enhancer cause limb malformations, most commonly preaxial polydactyly ( Table S1 ) ( Hill and Lettice, 2013; Lettice et al., 2003; VanderMeer and Ahituv, 2011 21. Hill, R.E. ∙ Lettice, L.A. Alterations to the remote control of Shh gene expression cause congenital abnormalities Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Dyn. 2011; 240 :920-930 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). ZRS mutations implicated in polydactyly cause ectopic activation of Shh expression in the anterior margin of limb bud mesenchyme in addition to the normal activity domain in the posterior margin of the limb bud ( Lettice et al., 2014; Masuya et al., 2007 35. Lettice, L.A. ∙ Williamson, I. ∙ Devenney, P.S. ... Development of five digits is controlled by a bipartite long-range cis-regulator Development. 2014; 141 :1715-1725 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar 39.

A series of ENU-induced single-base substitutions in a long-range cis-element altering Sonic hedgehog expression in the developing mouse limb bud Genomics. 2007; 89 :207-214 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Misexpression of Shh in the anterior domain results in erroneous digit outgrowth and polydactyly. To date, 21 different human mutations in this enhancer have been identified in patients with polydactyly and reported in the literature ( Table S1 ). Each mutation is individually rare, with most described in a single case or family, and none are present in current public genetic variant databases (gnomAD r.2.0.1 or dbSNP Build 150). Despite the extensive body of work on this enhancer, the majority (86%) of these rare variants have never been validated in vivo for their effect on gene expression, and only one has been experimentally demonstrated to cause abnormal limb development when introduced into the mouse genome ( Lettice et al., 2014 35. Lettice, L.A. ∙ Williamson, I. ∙ Devenney, P.S. ... Development of five digits is controlled by a bipartite long-range cis-regulator Development. 2014; 141 :1715-1725 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given this remarkable concentration of mutations implicated in both human limb malformations and vertebrate evolution, the ZRS enhancer provides a rich testbed for the systematic assessment of the effects of sequence variation on enhancer activity.
In this study, we used enSERT to systematically mutagenize all nucleotides of the human ZRS enhancer (789 bp) either individually (80 variants) or in combination with other positions (67 compound constructs containing 16–40 mutations each). We first describe the functional assessment of all reported human ZRS enhancer mutations implicated in polydactyly, showing that 71% (15/21) drive abnormal reporter gene expression in the limb, which supports their pathogenicity. In contrast, 29% (6/21) of the published variants had no apparent impact on gene expression, raising the possibility that these are rare but potentially benign variants coincidentally present in polydactyly patients. We confirmed these findings using knockin mice carrying point mutations corresponding to the human variants, in which only mutations altering reporter gene expression as determined by enSERT result in abnormal limb development. We next explored this approach as a prospective functional screening tool after resequencing the ZRS in 61 cases of polydactyly of unknown genetic etiology. Of eight newly discovered rare variants in these individuals, we could functionally implicate three as likely pathogenic for polydactyly. Finally, we performed systematic mutagenesis of the ZRS enhancer and demonstrate that many nucleotides, spread across the entire length of the enhancer, are critical for its normal function. Notably, random mutagenesis uncovered novel gain-of-function mutations that have not yet been reported in human patients with polydactyly. We propose that preemptive in vivo systematic mutagenesis screens of disease-associated enhancers to establish supportive functional data will facilitate the interpretation of future human genetics findings.

Although this method has been a gold standard for assessing the effects of human sequence variants on in vivo enhancer activity (e.g., Fakhouri et al., 2014; Lettice et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2017 13.

Genomic Patterns of De Novo Mutation in Simplex Autism Cell. 2017; 171 :710-722.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ), it suffers from low efficiency of transgene integration and position effects that complicate the interpretation of experimental data. Thus, it requires generating a large number of transgenic animals and makes large-scale variant assessment prohibitively expensive. To overcome these limitations, we developed enSERT, a transgenic approach based on Cas9-mediated integration ( Figure 1 A). We identified a safe harbor integration site in the mouse genome that resulted in high CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (the H11 locus) ( Tasic et al., 2011 52. Tasic, B. ∙ Hippenmeyer, S. ∙ Wang, C. ... Site-specific integrase-mediated transgenesis in mice via pronuclear injection Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :7902-7907 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as a minimal transgene promoter (from the Shh gene) with no background expression in this genomic location ( Figures 1 A and S1 ; STAR Methods ). With enSERT, we achieved an average transgenic rate of 50% for transgenes as large as 11 kb (based on >1,200 transgenic mice resulting from the injection of >150 independent transgenic constructs), compared to a 12% transgenic rate observed in conventional random transgenesis (based on >3,000 independent transgenic constructs) ( Figures 1 A and S1 ; STAR Methods ) ( Pennacchio et al., 2006; Visel et al., 2007 45. Pennacchio, L.A. ∙ Ahituv, N. ∙ Moses, A.M. ... In vivo enhancer analysis of human conserved non-coding sequences Nature. 2006; 444 :499-502 Crossref Scopus (926) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Visel, A. ∙ Minovitsky, S. ∙ Dubchak, I. ... VISTA Enhancer Browser--a database of tissue-specific human enhancers Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :D88-D92 Crossref Scopus (776) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, because of the site-specific integration, enSERT results in more reproducible enhancer activity detection and is compatible with expression in all major mouse embryonic tissues ( Figures 1 A and S2 A). In comparison with previous site-directed methods ( Tasic et al., 2011 52. Tasic, B. ∙ Hippenmeyer, S. ∙ Wang, C. ... Site-specific integrase-mediated transgenesis in mice via pronuclear injection Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :7902-7907 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ), enSERT does not require maintaining a mouse strain with a “landing pad” and, therefore, can be applied to any mouse strain of interest. The enSERT method overcomes the limitations of conventional enhancer-reporter transgenesis and enables a more than 4-fold increase in throughput of enhancer assessment in vivo .
We first demonstrated the ability of enSERT to robustly detect the effects of single variants on enhancer activity by testing a previously characterized pathogenic human ZRS allele ( Figure 1 C) (referred to as the “Cuban” variant in Lettice et al., 2003 33. Lettice, L.A. ∙ Heaney, S.J.H. ∙ Purdie, L.A. ... A long-range Shh enhancer regulates expression in the developing limb and fin and is associated with preaxial polydactyly Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12 :1725-1735 Crossref Scopus (895) PubMed Google Scholar ). Toward this goal, we developed an enhancer variant scoring system that classifies the limb enhancer activity patterns from LacZ staining into five different categories: (1) complete loss of activity, (2) reduced activity, (3) normal activity, (4) a gain of activity in the anterior limb bud, and (5) strong gain of activity in the anterior limb bud. Scoring was done by multiple annotators blinded to genotype (see STAR Methods ). As a control, we tested the reference human ZRS enhancer allele (789 bp) in parallel. For this reference allele, all examined embryos with site-specific integration of the transgene displayed normal activity at the region of the posterior margins of fore- and hindlimb buds (ZPA) where the Shh target gene is normally expressed, and none (0/17) displayed staining in the anterior margins of the limb buds ( Figures 1 C and S3 A) ( Lettice et al., 2003 33. Lettice, L.A. ∙ Heaney, S.J.H. ∙ Purdie, L.A. ... A long-range Shh enhancer regulates expression in the developing limb and fin and is associated with preaxial polydactyly Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12 :1725-1735 Crossref Scopus (895) PubMed Google Scholar ). For comparison, a conventional transgenic approach that relies on random transgene integration resulted in ZPA-specific activity in only 1/5 embryos, likely because of position effects ( Figure S3 B). We next introduced the Cuban variant into the human ZRS enhancer allele, and in all embryos examined by enSERT (5/5) we detected strong gain of enhancer activity in the anterior limb bud, consistent with a previously shown pathogenic role for this variant ( Figures 1 C and S3 A) ( Lettice et al., 2008 34. Lettice, L.A. ∙ Hill, A.E. ∙ Devenney, P.S. ... Point mutations in a distant sonic hedgehog cis-regulator generate a variable regulatory output responsible for preaxial polydactyly Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17 :978-985 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results indicate that enSERT robustly and reproducibly assesses the impact of non-coding variants on enhancer activity in vivo .
To functionally assess and classify rare non-coding, putatively pathogenic variation within the ZRS enhancer, we compiled all published ZRS variants that have been implicated in polydactyly in humans and other species ( Figure S2 B; Table S1 ). In total, this represents a panel of 29 variants (21 from human and 9 from other species, with 1 in common between human and mouse) ( Figure S2 B; Table S1 ). We introduced each of these variants into the human ZRS enhancer and individually assessed their impact on limb enhancer activity using enSERT in mice. The majority of these enhancer variants (15/21, 71% of human variants; 5/9, 56% of orthologous variants from other species) showed reproducible gain of enhancer activity in the anterior limb bud in hind- or forelimbs ( Figure 2 ; Table S2 ), consistent with a pathogenic role in polydactyly. In contrast, 29% (6/21) of the human variants previously proposed to be causal displayed normal enhancer activity in both hind- and forelimbs that was indistinguishable from the reference ZRS sequence, suggesting that they may be benign (see Figure 2 , Table S2 , and STAR Methods for more details on orthologous variants from other species).
To assess the utility of this functional screen for interpreting clinically obtained genetic data, we resequenced the ZRS in patients with preaxial polydactyly, including a total of 61 unrelated individual probands or families. We identified 10 rare variants in the ZRS enhancer in these cases, 8 of which were not previously reported ( Figure 2 ; Table S1 ). To assess these novel variants, we individually introduced each of them into the reference human ZRS sequence. Using enSERT, we observed that three of the eight variants (38%; 401A>C, 401A>G, and 407T>A) caused a gain of enhancer activity in the anterior limb bud that is consistent with a causal role in preaxial polydactyly. In contrast, the remaining five rare variants produced normal enhancer activity, suggesting that they are potentially benign ( Figure 2 ). Upon further genetic analysis, we observed that three of these five putatively benign variants are found in public variant databases (dbSNP), albeit at rare frequencies (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≤ 0.02%), providing additional evidence against their role in human polydactyly. These data support the use of functional interrogation of rare human enhancer variants in mice to reveal their impact on gene expression, and the translational application of this data to aid in the interpretation of clinically generated genetic information.
To assess the extent to which the observed changes in enhancer activity affect limb morphology in vivo , we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a series of 11 knockin mice where we introduced a human variant into the endogenous mouse ZRS enhancer ( Figure 3 A). We first individually introduced four of the variants (295T>C, 305A>T, 329T>C, and 297G>A) that did not cause misexpression of the reporter gene in the enSERT assay, and we observed that each resulted in normal limbs, further supporting that these variants may be benign ( Figure 3 B). In contrast, following the introduction of seven variants that caused misexpression of the reporter gene in the anterior portion of the limb bud (396C>T, 401A>G [newly reported in this study], 404G>A, 417A>G, 463T>G, 621C>G, and 739A>G), we observed five (396C>T, 401A>G, 404G>A, 417A>G, and 739A>G) that resulted in the formation of extra digits, reproducing phenotypes found in humans with polydactyly and confirming that these variants are indeed pathogenic ( Figures 3 and S4 ). In the two cases that did not result in polydactyly, the variants were in an area of increased sequence divergence between the human and mouse ZRS enhancers (621C>G) ( Figures S2 B and S4 ) or displayed weaker and more variable reporter gene misexpression (463T>G) ( Figure S4 ; Table S2 ). Taken together, these data support the power of enSERT for the scalable in vivo assessment of enhancer variants observed in patients.
To identify novel gain-of-function mutations in the human ZRS enhancer and to explore its functional robustness to sequence perturbation, we used enSERT to assess the general consequences of mutagenesis on ZRS activity in vivo . We systematically introduced point mutations in batches, in which we changed either ~5% or ~2% of bases within the enhancer. We first designed 17 non-overlapping 5% mutation constructs (40 base pair substitutions per construct) that in combination cover all nucleotides of the ZRS enhancer, except for base pairs that overlap or are immediately adjacent to variants implicated in polydactyly, which we tested separately (see below). In 82% of constructs (14/17), 5% mutagenesis completely abolished enhancer activity ( Figure 4 ). To reduce the mutational load, we next designed 43 non-overlapping 2% mutation constructs (16 base pair substitutions per construct) covering the same set of base pairs. In 70% of cases, 2% mutagenesis either completely abolished enhancer activity (26%, 11/43) or weakened the enhancer activity (44%, 19/43), further supporting the fragile nature of this enhancer. In contrast, in 23% of cases (10/43), 2% mutagenesis did not cause any observable changes in ZRS enhancer activity, suggesting that these nucleotides are not essential for enhancer function. Finally, in 7% of mutant constructs (3/43), we observed a gain of lacZ reporter expression in the anterior limb buds, suggesting the presence of additional, yet-to-be-identified, mutations that could cause polydactyly in humans ( Figure 4 ).
To identify the exact mutation(s) causing the gain of function observed within the 2% mutagenized constructs, we selected one construct (hs2496.69) for further dissection. We individually introduced each of 16 variants from this allele into the human ZRS enhancer and tested them using enSERT ( Figure 5 A). We observed that 14/16 individually tested variants did not result in gain of enhancer activity (constructs hs2496.111–123 and hs2496.126) ( Figure 5 A; Table S2 ). However, we found that each of the two remaining variants (763T>G [construct Hs2496.124] and 767T>C [Hs2496.125]) ( Figure 5 A; Table S2 ) was individually sufficient to cause anterior misexpression of the ZRS, consistent with the pattern seen for the composite 2% mutagenesis (hs2496.69) construct ( Figure 5 A). Notably, both variants are located within seven base pairs of each other and reside near a previously characterized polydactyly mutation (769T>C, M101116 Mouse). All three mutations appear to affect the same predicted SOX transcription factor binding site, which matches best to SOX5/SOX6/SOX9, all of which are crucial for limb development ( Figure 5 A) ( Akiyama et al., 2002 2. Akiyama, H. ∙ Chaboissier, M.C. ∙ Martin, J.F. ... The transcription factor Sox9 has essential roles in successive steps of the chondrocyte differentiation pathway and is required for expression of Sox5 and Sox6 Genes Dev. 2002; 16 :2813-2828 Crossref Scopus (1461) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observed clustering of gain-of-function mutations raised the question of whether this is a general phenomenon. Indeed, when we generated compound mutant constructs in which 30 base pairs immediately adjacent to gain-of-function variants were mutated, we observed a strong gain of ZRS activity in the anterior limb ( Figure S5 B; Table S2 ). These data support that additional pathogenic variants are likely to be uncovered in polydactyly cases as resequencing is applied to increasing numbers of patients.

Section: Discussion

Recent human genomics studies have revealed that most disease- and phenotype-associated variants discovered from genome-wide association studies do not affect protein-coding sequences but rather lie in the non-coding genome. Additionally, whole-genome sequencing of individuals is identifying a growing list of non-coding variants within the human population that could have a potential role in human biology ( Albert and Kruglyak, 2015; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2010 1. 1000 Genomes Project Consortium ∙ Abecasis, G.R. ∙ Altshuler, D. ... A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing Nature. 2010; 467 :1061-1073 Crossref Scopus (6275) PubMed Google Scholar 4. Albert, F.W. ∙ Kruglyak, L. The role of regulatory variation in complex traits and disease Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16 :197-212 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, reliably differentiating non-coding variants with and without phenotypic consequences represents a growing challenge. In the present study, we developed enSERT, with a focus on the robust and efficient in vivo assessment of human variants in distant-acting transcriptional enhancers. We used enSERT to systematically interrogate all published, as well as newly discovered unpublished, rare variants in the human ZRS enhancer found in patients with preaxial polydactyly. Our functional data show that 71% of published rare variants that were previously assumed to be causal result in ectopic in vivo enhancer activity. A majority of these gain-of-function variants that were knocked into the endogenous mouse enhancer result in polydactyly, thus further supporting their pathogenicity. In contrast, 29% of published rare variants fail to cause reporter misexpression in transgenic mice, or limb phenotypes in variant knockin mice, suggesting that these variants may be benign incidental observations in cases whose preaxial polydactyly is caused by other environmental and/or genetic factors. Indeed, for the majority of novel cases of preaxial polydactyly that we examined in this study (80%, 51/61 families) no rare base pair variants in the ZRS enhancer were identified.
The human population exhibits an excess of extremely rare variants, leading to the recommendation that low variant frequency alone must be taken with caution as evidence for pathogenicity ( 1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2010; Keinan and Clark, 2012; Li et al., 2017 1. 1000 Genomes Project Consortium ∙ Abecasis, G.R. ∙ Altshuler, D. ...

Notably, variants demonstrated to be pathogenic in our functional assay displayed higher levels of nucleotide conservation than apparently benign variants, suggesting that potentially pathogenic nucleotide positions are subject to purifying selection (p value < 0.01 by Mann-Whitney test) ( Figure S5 C). However, there is a substantial overlap in the ranges of conservation scores between the two variant classes, highlighting the difficulty of using conservation alone to distinguish between pathogenic and potentially benign variants ( Figure S5 C). Additionally, neither transcription factor motif analysis ( Figure S5 D) nor reported human genetics data ( Figure S5 E; Table S1 ) could explain the observed difference between those alleles experimentally classified as pathogenic or potentially benign in this study. These data emphasize the importance of functional assays to aid in distinguishing rare non-coding variants that are likely pathogenic from those potentially benign.
The extensive number of variants reported for the ZRS enhancer suggests that it is a hotspot for gain-of-function pathogenic mutations and that it could potentially harbor many more polydactyly-causing variants that have not yet been identified in human patients ( Hill and Lettice, 2013; Lettice et al., 2008; Sagai et al., 2004 21.

Our random mutagenesis data indicate that there are, indeed, a number of novel gain-of-function mutations yet to be discovered through patient sequencing. Based on our results, we expect that there are approximately 38 total base pairs that cause an ectopic gain of enhancer activity in the entire human ZRS enhancer (see STAR Methods ). However, these gain-of-function mutations account only for a small fraction (7%) of all ZRS base pairs that are deeply conserved between human and fish ( Figure S2 B), suggesting that gain-of-function mutations in enhancers may be rare and that, in isolation, most point mutations in enhancers will likely have a subtle effect on enhancer function ( Figure 5 B).
In summary, our work illustrates the power of large-scale transgenesis to comprehensively interrogate how non-coding variants affect human biology and raises the intriguing possibility of performing preemptive in vivo saturation mutagenesis screens for disease-associated enhancers to interpret new human genetics findings.

All animal work was reviewed and approved by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Animal Welfare and Research Committee. All mice used in this study were housed at the Animal Care Facility (ACF) of LBNL. Mice were monitored daily for food and water intake, and animals were inspected weekly by the Chair of the Animal Welfare and Research Committee and the head of the animal facility in consultation with the veterinary staff. The LBNL ACF is accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). Transgenic mouse assays and enhancer knock-ins were performed in Mus musculus FVB strain mice. The following developmental ages were used in this study: embryonic day E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E14.5 and E18.5 mice. Animals of both sexes were used in the analysis. See method details for sample size selection and randomization strategies.
For detailed clinical phenotypes of unrelated cases with ZRS variants see Table S1 . The human subjects committee at Washington University in St Louis approved this study (for data on human subjects that was collected in the USA). The analyses have been performed in a diagnostic basis (not research), in accordance with the bioethics rules of French law (for data on human subjects that was collected in France). All patients or, in the case of minors their parents, gave written consent for the study.
All transgenic and variant knock-in mice in this study were generated using a CRISPR/Cas9 microinjection protocol, as previously described ( Kvon et al., 2016 29. Kvon, E.Z. ∙ Kamneva, O.K. ∙ Melo, U.S. ... Progressive Loss of Function in a Limb Enhancer during Snake Evolution Cell. 2016; 167 :633-642.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a mix of Cas9 protein (final concentration of 20 ng/ul; IDT Cat. No. 1074181), sgRNA (50 ng/ul) and donor plasmid (25 ng/ul) in injection buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 0.1 mM EDTA) was injected into the pronucleus of FVB embryos. Female mice (CD-1 strain) were used as surrogate mothers. Super-ovulated female FVB mice (7–8 weeks old) were mated to FVB stud males, and fertilized embryos were collected from oviducts. The injected zygotes were cultured in M16 with amino acids at 37°C under 5% CO 2 for approximately 2 h. After that, zygotes were transferred into the uterus of pseudopregnant CD-1 females. F 0 embryos were collected at E11.5 (for LacZ staining) or E18.5 (for skeletal preparations). LacZ staining and skeletal preparations were performed as previously described ( Kvon et al., 2016 29. Kvon, E.Z. ∙ Kamneva, O.K. ∙ Melo, U.S. ... Progressive Loss of Function in a Limb Enhancer during Snake Evolution Cell. 2016; 167 :633-642.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). The procedures for generating transgenic and engineered mice were reviewed and approved by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Animal Welfare and Research Committee.
Transgenic mice carrying site-specific integration of the enhancer-reporter transgene were created using a modified CRISPR/Cas9 protocol. gRNAs targeting each of the integration sites (5qB1: 5′- gaaaagcatttagcag-3′; 14qE1: 5′-agacagccagcacgcttgtg-3′; H11: 5′-gctgatggaacaggtaacaa-3′) were designed using CHOPCHOP ( Montague et al., 2014 41. Montague, T.G. ∙ Cruz, J.M. ∙ Gagnon, J.A. ... CHOPCHOP: a CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN web tool for genome editing Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W401-W407 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ) and synthesized as previously described ( Kvon et al., 2016 29. Kvon, E.Z. ∙ Kamneva, O.K. ∙ Melo, U.S. ... Progressive Loss of Function in a Limb Enhancer during Snake Evolution Cell. 2016; 167 :633-642.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ) or ordered from IDT. To create a targeting vector containing the enhancer-reporter transgene, we first ordered chemically synthesized enhancer sequences flanked by homologous arms for Gibson cloning (for all ZRS enhancer variants; IDT) or PCR amplified enhancer sequences using primers with homology arm overhangs (for all other enhancers). All enhancer sequences and primers are available on the VISTA Enhancer Browser ( https://enhancer.lbl.gov/ ). We then cloned each individual enhancer into the Hsp68 :: lacZ (hs200 enhancer only) ( Pennacchio et al., 2006 45. Pennacchio, L.A. ∙ Ahituv, N. ∙ Moses, A.M. ... In vivo enhancer analysis of human conserved non-coding sequences Nature. 2006; 444 :499-502 Crossref Scopus (926) PubMed Google Scholar ) or Shh :: lacZ reporter vector (all other enhancers) flanked by homology arms to each of the three integration regions and incorporated it into the pCR4-TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) backbone using Gibson (New England Biolabs [NEB]) cloning ( Gibson et al., 2009 17. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.-Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (6581) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A). The map and the sequence of the PCR4- Shh :: lacZ -H11 vector (with Shh promoter) is available at Addgene (Addgene plasmid #139098). After pronuclear microinjections (see above), the F 0 embryos were harvested at embryonic days E11.5, E12.5, E13.5 or E14.5 and processed for LacZ staining. The embryos were genotyped by PCR and Sanger sequencing using primers 5′F and 5′R (for 5′ homology arm) and 3′F and 3′R (for 3′ homology arm).
To develop enSERT, we first selected three landing sites in the mouse genome that contained previously integrated transgenes with no ectopic expression in mouse embryos (5qB1, 14qE1, and H11) ( Ruf et al., 2011; Tasic et al., 2011 46. Ruf, S. ∙ Symmons, O. ∙ Uslu, V.V. ... Large-scale analysis of the regulatory architecture of the mouse genome with a transposon-associated sensor Nat. Genet. 2011; 43 :379-386 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Tasic, B. ∙ Hippenmeyer, S. ∙ Wang, C. ... Site-specific integrase-mediated transgenesis in mice via pronuclear injection Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :7902-7907 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). We designed sgRNAs targeting each of the three loci ( Figure S1 A). We first tested a sensor targeting vector containing the human hs200 forebrain enhancer ( Pennacchio et al., 2006 45. Pennacchio, L.A. ∙ Ahituv, N. ∙ Moses, A.M. ... In vivo enhancer analysis of human conserved non-coding sequences Nature. 2006; 444 :499-502 Crossref Scopus (926) PubMed Google Scholar ), along with the Hsp68 promoter and lacZ reporter gene, at each of these integration sites. We chose the H11 locus for downstream studies because it had a high (65%) knock-in efficiency with 93% (28/30) of knock-in embryos showing LacZ staining in the forebrain ( Figures S1 B and S1D).
In an initial test using a known forebrain enhancer (hs200) linked to the Hsp68 promoter and lacZ gene, we observed the expected forebrain staining. However, we also observed unexpected but consistent background expression outside of the forebrain, including in the neural tube, heart, dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal and midbrain ( Figure S1 E). 25 out of 28 embryos (89%) that harbored hs200- Hsp68::lacZ inserted at the H11 locus displayed this unexpected ectopic activity. Because previous transgene insertions at the H11 locus did not display similar activity in E11.5 embryos ( Tasic et al., 2011 52. Tasic, B. ∙ Hippenmeyer, S. ∙ Wang, C. ... Site-specific integrase-mediated transgenesis in mice via pronuclear injection Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :7902-7907 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ) we hypothesized that it was more likely to be caused by the hs200 enhancer or the Hsp68 promoter than gene regulatory elements in the vicinity of the H11 integration site. To determine if this staining was due to the enhancer or the Hsp68 promoter, we generated transgenic embryos harboring only the Hsp68::lacZ inserted at the H11 locus (same vector as before except with no enhancer). The ectopic expression persisted in these embryos, indicating that the background expression was not caused by the hs200 enhancer but by the Hsp68 promoter ( Figure S1 F). Small amounts of background expression (in neural tube) were already known for the Hsp68 promoter when it was used for random transgenesis, and this background activity was more pronounced and widespread in the H11 system ( Figure S1 F), necessitating the search for a new promoter. We, therefore, replaced the Hsp68 promoter with a promoter of the Shh gene (mm10: chr5:28,466,764-28,467,284). Shh is a developmental gene tightly regulated by multiple tissue-specific enhancers that are active in various embryonic tissues and is, therefore in principle, expected to be suitable for enhancer analysis. Indeed, all embryos that contained Shh :: lacZ (with no enhancer) inserted at H11 locus did not display any lacZ activity ( Figures S1 G and S1F), while insertion of hs200- Shh :: lacZ (with hs200 enhancer) at the H11 locus resulted in only the expected forebrain-specific expression ( Figure S1 G).
To test if a combination of a Shh promoter and H11 integration site will support specific expression in various mouse tissues and for a majority of enhancers, we used enSERT to test a panel of human and mouse enhancers collectively active across all major embryonic tissues of the mid-gestation mouse embryo. This set included enhancers active in the heart (hs1760), dorsal root ganglion (hs215), neural tube (hs1043), tail (hs1472), face (mm1917), branchial arch (hs2580), limb (ZRS and hs1473), trigeminal (hs215), forebrain (hs200), midbrain (hs2594), hindbrain (hs2597), and eye (hs1473) (see VISTA Enhancer Browser for details, https://enhancer.lbl.gov ). All enhancers were active in the respective tissues, confirming that enSERT is compatible with expression analysis across different mouse tissues ( Figure S2 A).
In ~50% of transgenic embryos, we observed integration of multiple copies of the enhancer- lacZ transgene at the H11 locus, which resulted in more robust lacZ reporter expression than the single-copy integrations. Multicopy integration did not result in an increase in the background activity ( Figure S1 F) and most likely resulted from the tandem insertion of the entire donor plasmid at the H11 locus, with both 5′ and 3′ homology arms integrated correctly ( Figure S1 C). To detect tandem integration at the H11 locus, we used the 3′F and 3′R H11 primers, along with the Tandem-F and Tandem-R primers that amplified part of the donor plasmid backbone (PCR4-TOPO). Embryos that were positive by PCR-based genotyping for the correctly targeted plasmid integration into H11 but negative for the donor plasmid backbone were presumed to harbor a single-copy transgene insertion at H11 locus ( Figure S1 A), while those positive for both the correctly targeted insertion AND the backbone sequence were assumed to be tandem integrations. For most enhancers that we tested at the H11 locus, single copy transgene integration was sufficient to drive robust lacZ activity in E11.5 mouse embryos ( Figure S2 A). However, a single copy of a transgene containing the ZRS enhancer drove weak lacZ activity that did not allow comparisons between different ZRS enhancer mutants. We therefore only compared ZRS enhancer activity between transgenic embryos with multiple copies of the transgene.
To assess the specificity of enSERT in detecting limb enhancer misexpression, we individually introduced 12 point mutations into the human ZRS enhancer that were outside of the known variants. All 12 mutations produced normal enhancer activity patterns that were indistinguishable from a reference allele, and none of the 12 mutations caused a gain of enhancer activity (constructs Hs2496.14, Hs2496.19, Hs2496.20, Hs2496.23-27, Hs2496.30, Hs2496.35, Hs2496.36, Hs2496.43; Figure S5 A; Table S2 ). When we mutated base pairs that were immediately adjacent to potentially benign variants (from Figure 2 ), this resulted in normal enhancer activity, as well (constructs Hs2496.146 and Hs2496.147; Figure S5 B; Table S2 ). These data support the specificity of enSERT in detecting ZRS enhancer misexpression in the anterior portion of the limb buds.
When we assessed human ZRS variants using enSERT in mice ( Figure 2 ), we used the 789 bp human ZRS allele with the introduced variant to avoid potential effects caused by enhancer sequence divergence between human and mouse. To assess ZRS variants from other species and to test how ZRS sequence divergence affects variant assessment, we first introduced four previously characterized mouse mutations of spontaneous (Hemimelic extra-toes [Hx] mouse) ( Knudsen and Kochhar, 1981 26. Knudsen, T.B. ∙ Kochhar, D.M. The role of morphogenetic cell death during abnormal limb-bud outgrowth in mice heterozygous for the dominant mutation Hemimelia-extra toe (Hmx) J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1981; 65 :289-307 PubMed Google Scholar ) or mutagen-induced (M101116, M100081, and DZ mouse strains) ( Masuya et al., 2007; Sagai et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2009 39. Masuya, H. ∙ Sezutsu, H. ∙ Sakuraba, Y. ... A series of ENU-induced single-base substitutions in a long-range cis-element altering Sonic hedgehog expression in the developing mouse limb bud Genomics. 2007; 89 :207-214 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar 47.

Genet. 2009; 18 :3090-3097 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) origin; Figure S2 B; Table S1 ) into the human ZRS enhancer sequence. All four orthologous mutations resulted in anterior lacZ reporter misexpression ( Figure 2 ) when introduced into a human enhancer background, suggesting that humans harboring the orthologous mutations will likely have polydactyly. Indeed, patients who have heterozygous DZ (407T>A) and M100081 (406A>G) variants display severe polydactyly ( Table S1 ) ( Norbnop et al., 2014 42. Norbnop, P. ∙ Srichomthong, C. ∙ Suphapeetiporn, K. ... ZRS 406A>G mutation in patients with tibial hypoplasia, polydactyly and triphalangeal first fingers J. Hum. Genet. 2014; 59 :467-470 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then introduced putative polydactyly mutations from cats (UK1, UK2, and Hemingway) and chicken (Silkie1 and Silkie2) into the human ZRS enhancer ( Figure S2 B; Table S1 ). Of these five alleles, only the Silkie2 mutation caused anterior lacZ reporter misexpression, while variant human ZRS enhancers with orthologous Silkie1 or any of the orthologous cat mutations did not cause anterior lacZ reporter misexpression and displayed enhancer activity patterns that were indistinguishable from the reference allele ( Figure 2 ). All three cat mutations are located in regions of significant sequence divergence between human, mouse, and cat, which could potentially explain why the cat variants do not cause reporter gene expression in the anterior limb bud when embedded into the sequence context of the human enhancer.
To estimate a total number of pathogenic gain-of-function nucleotide positions in the 789 bp ZRS enhancer, we first started with 18 nucleotide positions that overlapped pathogenic variants from our initial screen ( Figure 2 ). We next added nucleotides that were immediately adjacent to pathogenic nucleotides. Since we tested them combined in two different batches, the number of additional pathogenic nucleotides from these mutation-adjacent positions is somewhere between two (lower estimate) and 30 (higher estimate) ( Figure S5 B). Finally, we estimated 14 more gain-of-function positions in the remaining 741 nucleotides based on the 7% frequency of gain-of-function 2% mutants in our systematic mutagenesis and considering positions that were potentially masked by loss-of-function 2% mutants ( Figure 5 A). This resulted in a total estimate of approximately 38 pathogenic nucleotides.
To determine the sequence basis of the loss-of-function mutations, we selected a 2% mutant (hs2496.77) that resulted in complete abolishment of enhancer activity and individually introduced each of the variants into the human ZRS enhancer ( Figure 4 ). We could not identify critical base pairs because all 16/16 mutants with individual variants displayed normal enhancer activity (constructs Hs2496.127-142; Figure 5 B; Table S2 ). These results suggest potential redundancy between ZRS base pairs or a cumulative effect of small undetectable changes, with individual point mutations having little to no effect on enhancer activity, but multiple combined mutations having deleterious effects. This intra-enhancer robustness is similar to the redundancy observed between multiple individual highly conserved enhancers ( Osterwalder et al., 2018 43. Osterwalder, M. ∙ Barozzi, I. ∙ Tissières, V. ... Enhancer redundancy provides phenotypic robustness in mammalian development Nature. 2018; 554 :239-243 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mouse strains carrying a human variant knocked into the ZRS enhancer were created using a CRISPR/Cas9 protocol (see Figure S4 A for details). The sgRNA targeting the ZRS enhancer region was designed using CHOPCHOP ( Montague et al., 2014 41. Montague, T.G. ∙ Cruz, J.M. ∙ Gagnon, J.A. ... CHOPCHOP: a CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN web tool for genome editing Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W401-W407 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ) to position the guide target sequence outside the conserved ZRS core near its 5′ border (sgRNA recognition sequence was 5′- gaatgcatgcaggaactcagGGG −3′, where GGG is the PAM). To create a donor plasmid, a mouse ZRS enhancer with the corresponding human single nucleotide variant and mutagenized sgRNA recognition site ( Figure S4 A) was chemically synthesized (IDT), flanked by homology arms and incorporated into the pCR4-TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) backbone using Gibson cloning as previously described ( Kvon et al., 2016 29. Kvon, E.Z. ∙ Kamneva, O.K. ∙ Melo, U.S. ... Progressive Loss of Function in a Limb Enhancer during Snake Evolution Cell. 2016; 167 :633-642.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). After pronuclear microinjections, F 0 mice were collected at embryonic day E18.5 and genotyped by PCR and Sanger sequencing using primers LF, LR, RF, and RR (see Figure S4 A; Key Resources Table ).
Skeletal preparations were performed as previously described ( Kvon et al., 2016 29. Kvon, E.Z. ∙ Kamneva, O.K. ∙ Melo, U.S. ... Progressive Loss of Function in a Limb Enhancer during Snake Evolution Cell. 2016; 167 :633-642.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ) according to a standard Alcian blue/Alizarin red protocol ( Ovchinnikov, 2009 44. Ovchinnikov, D. Alcian blue/alizarin red staining of cartilage and bone in mouse Cold Spring Harb Protoc. 2009; 2009 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). The stained embryos were dissected in 80% glycerol, and limbs were imaged at 1x using a Leica MZ16 microscope and a Leica DFC420 digital camera.
The stained transgenic embryos were imaged from both sides using a Leica MZ16 microscope and Leica DFC420 digital camera. We only considered transgenic embryos that contained tandem integration of the transgene at the H11 locus, as single integration of the ZRS- lacZ transgene did not produce sufficiently robust staining in the limb buds (see above for details). A total of 1243 embryo images for all tested alleles of the human ZRS enhancer were shuffled and their labels removed for scoring. Annotation was performed by five independent reviewers blinded to the ZRS allele genotype. The reviewers classified each image to one of the following enhancer activity patterns in the limb buds: 1) lost, 2) reduced, 3) normal (i.e., indistinguishable from the reference allele), 4) gain (i.e., staining was present in the most anterior portion of the hind- or forelimb buds), and 5) strong gain (i.e., strong staining was present in the most anterior portion of the hind- or forelimb buds) ( Figure S3 C). Both sides of the embryo were annotated for most embryos. Final annotations for each transgenic embryo were determined by the staining type with the most reviewer votes and by vote consistency between the left and the right limb buds. An allele was classified as altering ZRS activity if it resulted in a statistically significant increase in transgenic embryos with activity patterns that deviated from normal (i.e., activity loss or gain) compared to the reference human ZRS enhancer allele (Fisher’s exact test p value < 0.05, Figures S3 C and S3D; Table S2 ).
Sample sizes for transgenic assays were selected empirically based on our previous experience of performing transgenic mouse assays for > 4,000 total putative enhancers ( Attanasio et al., 2013; Blow et al., 2010; May et al., 2011; Pennacchio et al., 2006; Visel et al., 2007; 2009a 6.

Mouse embryos were excluded from further analysis if they did not carry the reporter transgene at the H11 locus, contained only a single copy of the reporter or contained ectopic staining outside the limb (suggesting random integration). All transgenic mice were treated with identical experimental conditions. Randomization and experimenter blinding were performed during the scoring of embryo images (see above).
