Title: Oxidative Metabolism Drives Immortalization of Neural Stem Cells during Tumorigenesis


Abstract: Summary

Metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of many cancers, but how and when it contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming induced by mitochondrial fusion can be rate-limiting for immortalization of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and trigger their irreversible dedication to tumorigenesis. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we find that Drosophila brain tumors contain a rapidly dividing stem cell population defined by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We combine targeted metabolomics and in vivo genetic screening to demonstrate that OxPhos is required for tumor cell immortalization but dispensable in neural stem cells (NSCs) giving rise to tumors. Employing an in vivo NADH/NAD + sensor, we show that NSCs precisely increase OxPhos during immortalization. Blocking OxPhos or mitochondrial fusion stalls TICs in quiescence and prevents tumorigenesis through impaired NAD + regeneration. Our work establishes a unique connection between cellular metabolism and immortalization of tumor-initiating cells.

Section: Introduction

Tumor cells are immortalized and display a number of characteristic features that distinguish them from normal cells. Among those, reprogramming of metabolic pathways is indisputable but only partially understood. Since Otto Warburg demonstrated that tumor cells preferentially ferment glucose into lactate in lieu of oxygen-enabled mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (the Warburg effect) ( Warburg, 1956 73. Warburg, O. On respiratory impairment in cancer cells Science. 1956; 124 :269-270 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Warburg et al., 1927 74. Warburg, O. ∙ Wind, F. ∙ Negelein, E. THE METABOLISM OF TUMORS IN THE BODY J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3069) PubMed Google Scholar ), energy metabolism in tumor cells has been under growing scrutiny. Although widely accepted for multiple tumor types and animal models ( Flaveny et al., 2015 26. Flaveny, C.A. ∙ Griffett, K. ∙ El-Gendy, Bel.-D. ...

Cancer stem cells from epithelial ovarian cancer patients privilege oxidative phosphorylation, and resist glucose deprivation Oncotarget. 2014; 5 :4305-4319 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ) rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) for retaining stemness of their cancerous cells. The complexity of metabolic reprogramming is illustrated by a recent report using isotope tracing to demonstrate defects in the tricarboxyic acid (TCA) cycle and increased glycolytic metabolism in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) ( Courtney et al., 2018 15. Courtney, K.D. ∙ Bezwada, D. ∙ Mashimo, T. ... Isotope Tracing of Human Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinomas Demonstrates Suppressed Glucose Oxidation In Vivo Cell Metab. 2018; 28 :793-800.e2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the same study also confirmed that, unlike ccRCC, brain- and lung-derived tumors retain fully functional and efficient glucose oxidation ( Courtney et al., 2018 15. Courtney, K.D. ∙ Bezwada, D. ∙ Mashimo, T. ... Isotope Tracing of Human Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinomas Demonstrates Suppressed Glucose Oxidation In Vivo Cell Metab. 2018; 28 :793-800.e2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that mitochondrion-dependent bioenergetics can also be a key contributor of tumorigenesis. It is now also well established that oxidative metabolism can contribute to tumor cell proliferation by promoting biosynthesis of aspartate and subsequent metabolism of nucleotides ( Birsoy et al., 2015 5. Birsoy, K. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Chen, W.W. ... An Essential Role of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain in Cell Proliferation Is to Enable Aspartate Synthesis Cell. 2015; 162 :540-551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sullivan et al., 2015 63.

Supporting Aspartate Biosynthesis Is an Essential Function of Respiration in Proliferating Cells Cell. 2015; 162 :552-563 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (774) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, when these metabolic changes are required during tumorigenesis and how they can contribute to the immortalization process is unknown.
Because the complex microenvironment and heterogeneity of mammalian tumors make it difficult to address the precise timing and function of metabolic changes during the tumorigenesis process, we used a genetically defined Drosophila neural stem cell (NSC)-derived tumor model to overcome these caveats. Drosophila NSCs and neuroblasts (NBs) have proven to be an important model for understanding key developmental processes like asymmetric cell division and temporal patterning ( Homem and Knoblich, 2012 32. Homem, C.C.F. ∙ Knoblich, J.A. Drosophila neuroblasts: a model for stem cell biology Development. 2012; 139 :4297-4310 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the larval stages of development, NBs form neurons and glia cells following highly reproducible lineages. NBs and their progeny do not migrate and are surrounded by a glial sheath, so they can be easily recognized and tracked in clonal analysis. Multiple cellular markers allow unambiguous tracking of maturation in progenitors and differentiation in the daughter cells so NBs are particularly suitable for studying aberrant cell behavior such as tumorigenesis ( Jiang and Reichert, 2014 39. Jiang, Y. ∙ Reichert, H. Drosophila neural stem cells in brain development and tumor formation J. Neurogenet. 2014; 28 :181-189 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Changes in metabolism profoundly influence NB behavior ( Homem et al., 2014 33. Homem, C.C.F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Burkard, T.R. ... Ecdysone and mediator change energy metabolism to terminate proliferation in Drosophila neural stem cells Cell. 2014; 158 :874-888 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that bioenergetics and cell fate are tightly connected.
Based on their lineages, NBs are subdivided into type 0, type I, and type II. Type 0 NBs divide asymmetrically into one NB and one post-mitotic neuron ( Karcavich and Doe, 2005 40. Karcavich, R. ∙ Doe, C.Q. Drosophila neuroblast 7-3 cell lineage: a model system for studying programmed cell death, Notch/Numb signaling, and sequential specification of ganglion mother cell identity J. Comp.

Control of neuronal cell fate and number by integration of distinct daughter cell proliferation modes with temporal progression Development. 2012; 139 :678-689 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Type I NBs (NBIs) produce a ganglion mother cell (GMC) that again divides into two post-mitotic neurons or glia cells ( Buescher et al., 1998 11. Buescher, M. ∙ Yeo, S.L. ∙ Udolph, G. ... Binary sibling neuronal cell fate decisions in the Drosophila embryonic central nervous system are nonstochastic and require inscuteable-mediated asymmetry of ganglion mother cells Genes Dev. 1998; 12 :1858-1870 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Type II NBs (NBIIs) generate transit-amplifying intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) ( Bello et al., 2008 2. Bello, B.C. ∙ Izergina, N. ∙ Caussinus, E. ... Amplification of neural stem cell proliferation by intermediate progenitor cells in Drosophila brain development Neural Dev. 2008; 3 :5 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ; Boone and Doe, 2008 6.

The tumor suppressors Brat and Numb regulate transit-amplifying neuroblast lineages in Drosophila Dev. Cell. 2008; 14 :535-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ) that divide asymmetrically 5–6 times, each time generating a GMC that ultimately gives rise to two neurons or glia cells. NBIIs can be uniquely identified based on their expression of the Ets transcription factor Pointed (PntP1) ( Zhu et al., 2011 83. Zhu, S. ∙ Barshow, S. ∙ Wildonger, J. ... Ets transcription factor Pointed promotes the generation of intermediate neural progenitors in Drosophila larval brains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :20615-20620 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by the absence of Asense (Ase), a neural precursor marker present in all other NB subtypes ( Brand et al., 1993 8. Brand, M. ∙ Jarman, A.P. ∙ Jan, L.Y. ... asense is a Drosophila neural precursor gene and is capable of initiating sense organ formation Development. 1993; 119 :1-17 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Jarman et al., 1993 38. Jarman, A.P. ∙ Brand, M. ∙ Jan, L.Y. ... The regulation and function of the helix-loop-helix gene, asense, in Drosophila neural precursors Development. 1993; 119 :19-29 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Right after division, each INP undergoes a stereotypical maturation process that can be tracked by sequential expression of unique markers. In newly born INPs, the asymmetrically segregating RNA binding protein Brain tumor (Brat) post-transcriptionally inhibits the general NB marker Deadpan (Dpn) ( Reichardt et al., 2018 58. Reichardt, I. ∙ Bonnay, F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ... The tumor suppressor Brat controls neuronal stem cell lineages by inhibiting Deadpan and Zelda EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :102-117 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a stereotypical fashion, the INP then turns on Ase, followed by re-expressing Dpn, before it re-enters the cell cycle. The presence of a transit-amplifying population greatly increases the number of neurons generated by each NBII, and this might explain why NBIIs are particularly susceptible to tumorigenesis when the asymmetric cell division machinery or differentiation programs are altered ( Kelsom and Lu, 2012 41.

Knoblich, J.A. Asymmetric cell division: recent developments and their implications for tumour biology Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :849-860 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ).
NBs mutant for brat give rise to abnormal INPs that constitutively express the Brat targets dpn and zelda ( Reichardt et al., 2018 58. Reichardt, I. ∙ Bonnay, F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ... The tumor suppressor Brat controls neuronal stem cell lineages by inhibiting Deadpan and Zelda EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :102-117 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead of initiating Ase expression and re-entering mitosis, tumor-initiating cells enter a long transient cell cycle arrest ( Bowman et al., 2008 7. Bowman, S.K. ∙ Rolland, V. ∙ Betschinger, J. ... The tumor suppressors Brat and Numb regulate transit-amplifying neuroblast lineages in Drosophila Dev. Cell. 2008; 14 :535-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only after 24–48 h do they undergo mitosis and irrevocably convert into immortal tumor NBs (tNBs) ( Caussinus and Gonzalez, 2005 14. Caussinus, E. ∙ Gonzalez, C. Induction of tumor growth by altered stem-cell asymmetric division in Drosophila melanogaster Nat. Genet. 2005; 37 :1125-1129 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ) that will form huge lethal and transplantable brain tumors. Although all brain NBs become quiescent and differentiate or die during pupariation, tNBs can sustain proliferation until adulthood ( Betschinger et al., 2006 4. Betschinger, J. ∙ Mechtler, K. ∙ Knoblich, J.A. Asymmetric segregation of the tumor suppressor brat regulates self-renewal in Drosophila neural stem cells Cell. 2006; 124 :1241-1253 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ; Landskron et al., 2018 44. Landskron, L. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Bonnay, F. ... The asymmetrically segregating lncRNA cherub is required for transforming stem cells into malignant cells eLife. 2018; 7 :R106 Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar ), indicating that they lack major proliferation control mechanisms. How these tumor cells become immortal and why they resist metamorphosis-induced differentiation remains a mystery.
Because our previous results indicated a strong connection between metabolism and growth control in the Drosophila brain ( Homem et al., 2014 33. Homem, C.C.F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Burkard, T.R. ... Ecdysone and mediator change energy metabolism to terminate proliferation in Drosophila neural stem cells Cell. 2014; 158 :874-888 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), we used the NBII lineage to investigate metabolic reprogramming during tumorigenesis. Our results reveal that brat NSC-derived tumors exhibit increased TCA intermediates and higher oxygen consumption, whereas lactate production and acidity rates, hallmarks of the Warburg effect, are only minimally changed. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of brat tumors, we identified a distinct subpopulation of tumor cells with higher expression of respiratory enzymes. Our genetic data suggest that the oxidative population drives tumor formation, whereas the glycolytic population is secondary. We generated an in vivo metabolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) sensor to demonstrate that uncoupling of transcriptional and metabolic changes in the brat mutant type II NB population is rate limiting for their irreversible commitment to tumorigenesis. Finally, we show that uncontrolled mitochondrial fusion causes the rate-limiting metabolic changes observed in the tumor population. Our data reveal an unexpected connection between mitochondrial metabolism and cellular immortalization and show that precise coordination between cell fate and metabolic changes is essential to avoid tumorigenesis.

Section: Results

Metabolic regulation is critical for the onset and termination of proliferation in Drosophila NSCs ( Homem et al., 2014 33. Homem, C.C.F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Burkard, T.R. ... Ecdysone and mediator change energy metabolism to terminate proliferation in Drosophila neural stem cells Cell. 2014; 158 :874-888 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ; Otsuki and Brand, 2018 52. Otsuki, L. ∙ Brand, A.H. Cell cycle heterogeneity directs the timing of neural stem cell activation from quiescence Science. 2018; 360 :99-102 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether immortalization of Drosophila NSCs is associated with alterations of metabolic pathways, we re-analyzed the transcriptome of NBIIs and their tumorigenic brat RNAi counterparts (tNBs) ( Landskron et al., 2018 44. Landskron, L. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Bonnay, F. ... The asymmetrically segregating lncRNA cherub is required for transforming stem cells into malignant cells eLife. 2018; 7 :R106 Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar ). We determined mRNA expression changes between tNBs and NBIIs for a wide range of enzymes catalyzing the reactions of gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, fermentation, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the TCA cycle, OxPhos, and nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis ( Figure S1 A). Interestingly, four glycolytic enzymes ( Hex-A , Pfk , Ald , and Pgm ) and the two fermentation-promoting enzymes lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ( PDK ) were increased more than 4-fold in tNBs. In contrast, most OxPhos-related enzymes were unchanged or downregulated. These gene expression data could be interpreted to mean that brat RNAi brain tumors show enhanced glycolytic activity at the expense of OxPhos, as already suggested for epithelial tumors in imaginal discs ( Eichenlaub et al., 2018 21.

Wang, C.-W. ∙ Purkayastha, A. ∙ Jones, K.T. ... In vivo genetic dissection of tumor growth and the Warburg effect eLife. 2016; 5 :11 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ).
We challenged our observations by directly measuring metabolic changes in brain tumors ( Figure 1 A). We measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of brat RNAi and control brain cells ( Figures 1 B–1D; Figures S1 C and S1D). Although the OCR and ECAR were increased in brain tumor cells, surprisingly, the OCR/ECAR ratio was also strongly increased, which is indicative of increased oxidative metabolism ( Figure 1 D). To confirm these initial results, we performed a targeted metabolomics analysis by mass spectrometry. Among 22 measured intermediates of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and PPP or amino acids ( Figure 1 E), we found six significantly increased metabolites in brat tumors. Three were intermediates of the TCA cycle (citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and malate), whereas none of the eight glycolytic intermediates were increased significantly. Lactate was increased slightly, but pyruvate, the pivotal final glycolytic product, was the most upregulated metabolite we observed. Although brat RNAi tumors mostly consist of tNBs, whereas control brains contain a majority of neurons, the observed metabolic changes are most likely due to alterations in the NB population. In mammals and Drosophila ( Hall et al., 2012 29. Hall, C.N. ∙ Klein-Flügge, M.C. ∙ Howarth, C. ... Oxidative phosphorylation, not glycolysis, powers presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying brain information processing J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :8940-8951 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ; Volkenhoff et al., 2015 71. Volkenhoff, A. ∙ Weiler, A. ∙ Letzel, M. ... Glial Glycolysis Is Essential for Neuronal Survival in Drosophila Cell Metab. 2015; 22 :437-447 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ), neurons predominantly rely on OxPhos; therefore, observing higher TCA cycle intermediates and oxygen consumption in stem-cell-enriched tumor brains is particularly intriguing.
We next investigated the origin of TCA cycle intermediates in brat tumors. Normally, glucose is metabolized into TCA cycle intermediates via glycolysis and subsequent import of pyruvate into mitochondria and its transformation into acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Tumor cells, however, can use other carbon sources, such as glutamine ( DeBerardinis et al., 2007 19. DeBerardinis, R.J. ∙ Mancuso, A. ∙ Daikhin, E. ... Beyond aerobic glycolysis: transformed cells can engage in glutamine metabolism that exceeds the requirement for protein and nucleotide synthesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :19345-19350 Crossref Scopus (2037) PubMed Google Scholar ) or acetate ( Mashimo et al., 2014 47. Mashimo, T. ∙ Pichumani, K. ∙ Vemireddy, V. ... Acetate is a bioenergetic substrate for human glioblastoma and brain metastases Cell. 2014; 159 :1603-1614 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (546) PubMed Google Scholar ), via generation of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetyl-CoA, respectively.
We independently performed [U- 13 C]glucose, [U- 13 C]L-Gln, and [U- 13 C]acetate labeling in control and tumor brains and analyzed the subsequent integration of 13 C into glycolysis, fermentation, and TCA cycle metabolites ( Figures 1 F–1I; Figures S1 E and S1F). Interestingly, incorporation of glucose into the TCA cycle (citrate [M2]) was lower in tumor brains than in control brains, whereas incorporation of glucose into lactate was higher ( Figures 1 F and 1G). This is consistent with the higher LDH and PDK levels found in tNBs in bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data ( Figure S1 A). Acetate was incorporated into the TCA cycle only to a minor extent in control and brat tumor brains (citrate [M2]) and therefore does not seem to be a main contributor to OxPhos in Drosophila brains ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Strikingly however, Gln was predominantly incorporated into the TCA cycle in control and tumor brains (malate [M4]) ( Figures 1 H and 1I). In control brains, 13 C from Gln was rapidly diluted during a second TCA cycle (citrate [M4] = 25%, citrate [M2] = 4%), indicating that these TCA intermediates were diverted toward other metabolic paths. In brat tumors, however, labeled TCA intermediates originating from 13 C-Gln were recycled to a higher degree (citrate [M4] = 46%, citrate [M2] = 10%), suggesting that, in brains tumors, Gln-derived TCA cycle intermediates play a more active role in OxPhos.
Altogether, these results indicate that brat tumors rely on Gln rather than glucose to fuel OxPhos and that Gln-generated TCA cycle intermediates are better recycled in the TCA cycle in brat tumors than in control brains, further suggesting their preferential use of OxPhos.
To determine bioenergetics in brat tNBs at cellular resolution, we generated transgenic flies expressing the sensor for the coenzymes NAD + and NADH (reduced form of NAD + ), sensor of NAD(H) redox (SoNar) ( Zhao et al., 2016 81. Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, A. ∙ Zou, Y. ... In vivo monitoring of cellular energy metabolism using SoNar, a highly responsive sensor for NAD(+)/NADH redox state Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1345-1359 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). SoNar can bind to either NAD + or NADH with specific conformations and excitatory wavelengths, allowing us to follow the NAD + /NADH ratio by live imaging. Because NADH consumption and NAD + production are not specific for fermentation or OxPhos, we first determined their relative contribution to the SoNar readout. We used oxamate to inhibit LDH, koningic acid to inhibit glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and rotenone and antimycin A to inhibit ETC complex I and III on dissociated tNBs from brat RNAi SoNar-expressing tNBs ( Videos S1 , S2 , and S3 ; Figures 1 J–1O). Although OxPhos inhibitors induced a clear drop in NAD + /NADH ratio, oxamate and koningic acid had no visible effect ( Figures 1 J–1M, 1O). Interestingly, however, not all tNBs decreased their NAD + /NADH ratio upon rotenone or antimycin A treatment ( Figure 1 J, white arrow; Videos S2 and S3 ), indicating metabolic heterogeneity among tumor cells. Our measurements were confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of SoNar activity after treating cells with LDH and OxPhos inhibitors ( Figure S1 B; Figures 1 K, 1L, and 1O). Finally, we used oxamate, koningic acid, and rotenone on SoNar-expressing NBIs to measure the tumor specificity of these responses ( Figures 1 N and 1O); as expected, normal NBs decreased their NAD + /NADH ratio upon oxamate but not rotenone treatment. Altogether, these results indicate that most brat tNBs shift to OxPhos and, unlike their non-tumorigenic counterparts, do not rely on fermentation for their bioenergetic needs.

Mammalian tumors are known to be dynamic and increase their heterogeneity with growth ( Lawson et al., 2018 45. Lawson, D.A. ∙ Kessenbrock, K. ∙ Davis, R.T. ... Tumour heterogeneity and metastasis at single-cell resolution Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :1349-1360 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, bioenergetic heterogeneity is considered to be essential for tumor progression and adaptability ( Nakajima and Van Houten, 2013 50. Nakajima, E.C. ∙ Van Houten, B. Metabolic symbiosis in cancer: refocusing the Warburg lens Mol. Carcinog. 2013; 52 :329-337 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the heterogeneity of brat tumors, we performed single-cell Switch Mechanism At the 5’ end of RNA Templates 2 (Smart-Seq2) RNA-seq on 157 brat RNAi tumor and 93 control central brain NBs sorted by FACS ( STAR Methods ; Figure S2 A). Although the sorting gate of control NBs was stringent enough to only collect NBIs and NBIIs (the largest and brightest cells), the sorting gate for tNBs was enlarged to account for the range of tNB cell sizes within the tumor ( Figure S2 B). Subsequently, 29 non-tumorigenic cells originating from NBI lineages were sequenced but excluded from tumor samples based on NBI/GMC markers ( ase high ) or absence of the proliferative marker ( dpn low ) ( Figure S2 A).
Initially, tNBs were analyzed separately using the Pseudotime analytical tool (Monocle R package) and separated by unsupervised clustering into three clusters of 14 (cluster 1 [c1]), 49 (c2), and 94 (c3) cells ( Figure 2 A). Interestingly, c1 was distinguished from all other tNBs by its proliferative signature: the G2 > M cell cycle inducer string ( stg ) was among the top 10 clustering genes. Furthermore, c1 tNBs also expressed higher levels of several key OxPhos components ( CG5214 [ α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase E2 ], Mdh2 , and the mitochondrial phosphate carrier [ Mpcp ]) and two enzymes catalyzing formation of α-ketoglutarate ( Figure 2 B; Figure S2 C) from lysine ( Sccpdh1 ) and glutamate ( Gdh ). This analysis suggests that c1 tNBs are the most proliferative and associated with higher levels of enzymes involved in OxPhos ( Figures 2 D, 2E, and 2G). Additionally, the inducers of G1 > S transition cyclin-E and E2f1 were less differentially expressed between the three clusters ( Figures 2 G–2I), suggesting that increased OxPhos is specifically correlated with the G2 > M phase transition in tNBs.
c3, the cluster most transcriptionally distinct from c1, was separated from other tNBs by its higher expression of glutathione-producing enzymes ( GstD9 and GstE1 ) and unfolded protein response chaperones ( Hsp26 and Hsp22 ) ( Figure 2 B), suggesting higher stress levels in these cells. Furthermore, LDH was higher in c3 compared with c1 and c2, probably indicating a distinct bioenergetic profile ( Figure 2 F). Finally, c2 expressed intermediate levels of stg and α-KGDH-E2 , indicating an intermediate or transient state between c1 and c3 ( Figures 2 D, 2E, and 2G). Overall, these results reveal a striking heterogeneity among brat RNAi tumor cells and identify a minor population of highly proliferative cells with higher OxPhos among a majority of cells that appear to be less proliferative and high in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/mitochondrial stress.
To compare the three tNB clusters with untransformed control NBs, we analyzed tNBs together with normal control NBs using Monocle ( Figure 2 C). Intriguingly, cells in c1, which express high levels of cell cycle regulators and OxPhos enzymes, were transcriptionally closest to the majority of the control NBs, whereas c3 was furthest away. A small minority of control NBs did not follow this general trend and clustered in close proximity to c3 tNBs ( Figure 2 C). This subpopulation is not identified when NBs are clustered without tNBs and shows significant expression differences in only three genes ( bru3 , troll , and Hr4 ), suggesting that this is a clustering artifact generated by the presence of residual non-tNBs in the brat RNAi population.
Taken together, our data indicate that proliferative and oxidative tNBs in c1 are generated first during tumorigenesis, whereas the glycolytic cells in c2 and c3 represent later cells that have already undergone changes to adapt to the hypoxic tumor environment.
To understand how OxPhos was maintained in c1 cells, we analyzed the expression pattern of all genes annotated as “transcription factors” (TFs) or “DNA_binding” in pseudotime across all tNBs and displayed candidates with cluster-specific expression changes ( Figure S2 D). We tested the role of 26 candidate TFs with a clear association with c1 in brat RNAi tumorigenesis ( Figure S2 E) and found that RNAi of the TFs E2F transcription factor 1 ( E2f1 ) and PAR-domain protein 1 ( pdp1 ) led to partial rescue of the tumor, as monitored by the tumor-specific RFP signal in adult flies. Although E2f1 is a known cell cycle inducer ( Duronio et al., 1995 20. Duronio, R.J. ∙ O’Farrell, P.H. ∙ Xie, J.E. ... The transcription factor E2F is required for S phase during Drosophila embryogenesis Genes Dev. 1995; 9 :1445-1455 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ), pdp1 is mostly known to regulate transcriptional activity in muscle and circadian clock neurons ( Cyran et al., 2003 16. Cyran, S.A. ∙ Buchsbaum, A.M. ∙ Reddy, K.L. ... vrille, Pdp1, and dClock form a second feedback loop in the Drosophila circadian clock Cell. 2003; 112 :329-341 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ), and its RNAi did not affect normal NBII proliferation ( Figure S2 F). These data suggest that pdp1 acts as a tumor-specific transcriptional regulator of the most oxidative and proliferative subpopulation of brat tumors.
To test whether the observed metabolic changes are biologically relevant for tumor growth, we designed a genetic screen for genes that are essential for tumor-induced adult lethality ( Figure 3 A). Compared with control flies, brat RNAi tumor-bearing flies have a dramatically shorter lifespan (15 days after hatching). Depleting genes essential for NSC proliferation, such as dpn , within the brat RNAi tumor restores the lifespan almost completely to that of control flies. Therefore, we used the time when 50% of the flies had died (LT50) as a readout for the degree of tumor rescue that can be achieved by depletion of individual metabolic enzymes ( Figure 3 B).
Using this assay, we performed an F2 genetic screen ( Figure S3 A) to test RNAi constructs targeting nearly all known enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, fermentation, the TCA cycle, ETC, and PPP ( Figures 3 C, 3D, and 3F; Figure S3 B) for their ability to rescue brat tumor-induced lethality. Strikingly, no RNAi construct targeting gluconeogenic, glycolytic, or fermenting enzymes led to significant lifespan rescue. In stark contrast, depletion of 10 TCA enzymes ( Idh , Pdhb , Acon , αKGDH-E1 , E2 , E3 , Mdh2 , Scs -α, Scs -β, and Fum1 ) and four of the five electron transport chain (ETC) complexes (complex I, III, IV, and V) ( Figures S4 C–S4H) each led to significant rescue of the tumor-induced lethality.
To further show that a rescued lifespan was indeed correlated with tumor prevention, we assessed the tumor burden by visualizing the tumor-specific RFP signal of adult flies. As expected, tumors depleted of glycolytic and fermentation enzymes had largely similar or even increased tumor burdens compared with control tumors (with the notable exception of Aldolase RNAi tumors, which showed partial rescue) ( Figure 3 E; Figures S4 A and S4B). In contrast, dpn - and OxPhos-deficient tumors showed no or very low tumor-specific signal, similar to control conditions, where no tumorigenesis was induced ( Figures 3 E and 3G; Figures S4 A and S4B).
These results could be explained if OxPhos enzymes were generally required for all NBII fitness and/or proliferation and, therefore, depleting them from the tumor would prevent its growth. To rule out this possibility, we tested the same RNAi constructs for their effect on normal, non-transformed NBII lineages ( Figures S3 C and S3D). As expected ( Zacharioudaki et al., 2012 80. Zacharioudaki, E. ∙ Magadi, S.S. ∙ Delidakis, C. bHLH-O proteins are crucial for Drosophila neuroblast self-renewal and mediate Notch-induced overproliferation Development. 2012; 139 :1258-1269 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), dpn RNAi strongly reduced NBII progeny numbers. Interestingly, Aldolase RNAi led to the same phenotype, indicating that glycolysis is required for normal NBII lineage proliferation and explaining its partial rescue of tumor formation. In striking contrast, RNAi of the three TCA cycle enzymes αKGDH-E2 , Scs-α , and Fum1 led to a non-significant slight increase in NBII progeny, and RNAi of the ETC complex I, III, and IV top tumor-rescuing enzymes led to stable NBII progeny numbers, indicating that OxPhos is specifically required for tNB but not normal NBII proliferation. These results are in line with our previous work showing that OxPhos is not required for non-tumorigenic NB proliferation ( Homem et al., 2014 33. Homem, C.C.F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Burkard, T.R. ... Ecdysone and mediator change energy metabolism to terminate proliferation in Drosophila neural stem cells Cell. 2014; 158 :874-888 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Altogether, these results indicate that tNBs, unlike healthy NBs, rely on oxygen-dependent bioenergetics to proliferate .
To further demonstrate that brat tumors rely on oxygen to proliferate, we raised brat RNAi tumor-forming larvae under hypoxic conditions (5% O 2 ) for 24, 48, or 72 h after 3 days of development. Strikingly, hypoxic incubation for 2 and 3 days led to ∼54% and ∼70% reduced tumor brain volume, respectively ( Figures 3 H and 3I). This oxygen dependence was tumor specific because control NBIIs grown under the same conditions did not alter their progeny numbers. Thus, reduced oxygen levels do not impair NBII proliferation but can significantly impair brain tumor growth ( Figures 3 J and 3K).
OxPhos can contribute to tumor cell proliferation by promoting biosynthesis of aspartate and subsequent metabolism of nucleotides ( Birsoy et al., 2015 5. Birsoy, K. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Chen, W.W. ... An Essential Role of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain in Cell Proliferation Is to Enable Aspartate Synthesis Cell. 2015; 162 :540-551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sullivan et al., 2015 63. Sullivan, L.B. ∙ Gui, D.Y. ∙ Hosios, A.M. ... Supporting Aspartate Biosynthesis Is an Essential Function of Respiration in Proliferating Cells Cell. 2015; 162 :552-563 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (774) PubMed Google Scholar ) by the enzymes glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 and 2 (Got1 and Got2). RNAi of both enzymes, however, did not rescue brat tumor formation ( Figure S3 E), suggesting that brat tumor OxPhos is not required for this purpose.
Our data indicate a metabolic shift from glycolysis to OxPhos when NBs become tumorigenic. Because the transcript levels of key TCA cycle and ETC enzymes were unchanged or even downregulated in tNBs ( Figure S1 A), we again analyzed our transcriptome data for other causes of metabolic reprogramming ( Landskron et al., 2018 44. Landskron, L. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Bonnay, F. ... The asymmetrically segregating lncRNA cherub is required for transforming stem cells into malignant cells eLife. 2018; 7 :R106 Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar ) and focused on markers of key mitochondrial functions ( Figure 4 A). Strikingly, the only mitochondrial markers upregulated in tNBs were the Dynamin-like GTPases marf and opa1 . Marf and Opa1 are required for mitochondrial fusion and regulate fusion of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively ( Westermann, 2010 75. Westermann, B. Mitochondrial fusion and fission in cell life and death Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :872-884 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because mitochondrial fusion is well known to increase OxPhos ( Mishra and Chan, 2016 49. Mishra, P. ∙ Chan, D.C. Metabolic regulation of mitochondrial dynamics J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :379-387 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ) and causes cells to rely more heavily on OxPhos for energy production ( Rossignol et al., 2004 59. Rossignol, R. ∙ Gilkerson, R. ∙ Aggeler, R. ... Energy substrate modulates mitochondrial structure and oxidative capacity in cancer cells Cancer Res. 2004; 64 :985-993 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wanted to find out whether deregulation of these enzymes could explain the observed metabolic transformations.
We investigated mitochondrial morphology in control NBIIs and tNBs at the L3 stage using a mitochondrial GFP reporter ( GFP COX8A ) ( Figure 4 B). Mitochondria appeared to be numerous, small, and round in control NBIIs and their immediate progeny, indicative of fragmented mitochondria. However, in most tNBs, mitochondria were thicker and more elongated, indicating sustained mitochondrial fusion events. A few tNBs, however, also showed fragmented mitochondria, even within the tumor tissue. It is well known that mitochondria are fragmented during mitosis ( Yamano and Youle, 2011 77. Yamano, K. ∙ Youle, R.J. Coupling mitochondrial and cell division Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13 :1026-1027 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), and because those cells often occur in pairs, they seem to be early post-mitotic cells. To confirm the presence of fused mitochondria in tNBs, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on dorsal sections of control and brat RNAi central brains ( Figure 4 C). brat RNAi tNBs contained longer mitochondria (∼2.3-fold in length and ∼2.8-fold in area) compared with NBIIs ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Interestingly, fused mitochondria were also observed in numb RNAi larval brain tumors ( Figure 4 B, rightmost panels). Like brat RNAi , numb RNAi results in formation of large, lethal, transplantable brain tumors ( Bowman et al., 2008 7. Bowman, S.K. ∙ Rolland, V. ∙ Betschinger, J. ... The tumor suppressors Brat and Numb regulate transit-amplifying neuroblast lineages in Drosophila Dev. Cell. 2008; 14 :535-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ; Caussinus and Gonzalez, 2005 14. Caussinus, E. ∙ Gonzalez, C. Induction of tumor growth by altered stem-cell asymmetric division in Drosophila melanogaster Nat. Genet. 2005; 37 :1125-1129 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, unlike brat tumors, numb tumors arise because of unrestricted, enhanced Notch pathway activation ( Bowman et al., 2008 7. Bowman, S.K. ∙ Rolland, V. ∙ Betschinger, J. ... The tumor suppressors Brat and Numb regulate transit-amplifying neuroblast lineages in Drosophila Dev. Cell. 2008; 14 :535-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, formation of enlarged, elongated mitochondria is a general feature of Drosophila NSC-derived tumors that is independent of the tumor-inducing signaling pathway.
Next, to determine whether brat RNAi tNBs mitochondrial fusion resulted in increased OxPhos, we labeled dissociated control and tNBs with tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM), whose fluorescence intensity correlates with mitochondrial membrane potential ( Figures S6 D–S6F). Expectedly, TMRM staining showed that tNBs have significantly increased mitochondrial potential compared with control NBs, indicating that brat RNAi tNB-fused mitochondria display increased ETC activity.
To analyze the role of marf , opa1 , and other mitochondrial regulators in tumorigenesis, we analyzed their effect on brat tumor lethality ( Figures 4 F and 4G) and tumor burden ( Figures 4 H and 4I; Figures S5 D and S5E). Strikingly, marf RNAi was sufficient to fragment tNB mitochondria ( Figure S5 A), completely abrogate the tumor, and rescue tumor-induced lethality, whereas overexpressing marf slightly increased the tumor burden. Depleting opa1 abrogated the tumor but did not rescue tumor-induced lethality. Because adult escapers did not harbor a detectable tumor, this early lethality is likely due to effects of opa1 RNAi outside of the NBII lineage. In contrast, depleting drp1 , a regulator of mitochondrial fission, did not affect tumor growth, indicating that mitochondrial fragmentation is not essential for the tumorigenesis process. Interestingly, we also found that ses-B , an ATP:ADP antiporter, and tko , a component of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit are essential for tumor growth ( Figures 4 F and 4G; Figures S5 D and S5E).
We also analyzed the role of marf , opa1 , and ses-B in normal NBIIs ( Figures S5 B and S5C). RNAi of any of these genes led to a similar or higher number of INPs compared with control NBII lineages. Altogether, these results indicate that mitochondrial fusion is an essential component of tumorigenesis in the Drosophila brain and the key mechanism underlying metabolic reprograming in tNBs.
To determine the precise role of metabolic reprogramming during tumor cell immortalization, we used SoNar to determine the metabolic state of each cell in the NBII lineage during tumorigenesis. For this, we first determined the point of no return for tumor formation using temperature-sensitive brat RNAi. We used the Temporal And Regional Gene Expression Targeting (TARGET) system ( McGuire et al., 2003 48. McGuire, S.E. ∙ Le, P.T. ∙ Osborn, A.J. ... Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila Science. 2003; 302 :1765-1768 Crossref Scopus (1024) PubMed Google Scholar ), where expression of the upstream activating sequence (UAS)/Gal4 system is prevented by a thermosensitive Gal80 (Gal80 TS ) inhibitor. This allowed us to induce brat RNAi by a temperature shift and then re-express the Brat protein by shifting back to the permissive temperature.
After 24 h of brat RNAi (induced by inactivating Gal80 TS at 29°C), NBIIs had generated several abnormal immature INPs (imINPs) that continued to express Dpn because dpn translation is not repressed by Brat ( Figure 5 A). However, at this stage, these dysfunctional imINPs are cell cycle arrested in G2 ( Bowman et al., 2008 7. Bowman, S.K. ∙ Rolland, V. ∙ Betschinger, J. ... The tumor suppressors Brat and Numb regulate transit-amplifying neuroblast lineages in Drosophila Dev. Cell. 2008; 14 :535-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ) and will not form a tumor when brat expression is restored (by restoring Gal80 TS by shifting the larvae back to 18°C) ( Figures S5 F and S5G). However, 48 h and 72 h after brat depletion, imINPs already began to regrow and reinitiate cell division ( Bowman et al., 2008 7. Bowman, S.K. ∙ Rolland, V. ∙ Betschinger, J. ... The tumor suppressors Brat and Numb regulate transit-amplifying neuroblast lineages in Drosophila Dev. Cell. 2008; 14 :535-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ). At this point, restoring brat expression can no longer prevent tumor formation, indicating that cell cycle re-entry irreversibly commits the abnormal INPs to tumorigenesis.
To correlate metabolic changes with tumor commitment, we reversibly depleted Brat by RNAi for 24 h in flies also expressing SoNar ( Figure 5 A). For this, we first used the detection wavelength for SoNar-NAD + because the SoNar-NADH signal was very sensitive to photobleaching and harder to detect ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and 5D, left panels). However, SoNar-NAD + levels were robustly detected (second left panels) and allowed us to distinguish two cell populations with a remarkably sharp boundary in between. Although NBs, imINPs (white arrowheads), and the first mature INPs (mINPs; yellow arrowheads) show relatively low NAD + levels, later mINPs and all more differentiated progeny have higher NAD + levels ( Figure 5 A, top panels). Interestingly, 24 h brat RNAi NBII lineages showed the exact same profile, with a sharp boundary between young and older tumor-initiating cells, despite the fact that all of them mis-expressed dpn (red arrowheads). However, after 48 h and 72 h of brat RNAi , a strong increase in NAD + levels occurred in the oldest tumor-initiating cells (TICs) furthest away from the NB ( Figures 5 B, bottom panels, blue arrowheads, and 5 D, 5E, and 5G, blue arrowheads). Importantly, NAD + and NADH levels increased in 48 h and 72 h brat RNAi TICs, as revealed by careful scanning of both SoNar excitation lengths ( Figure 5 C). Furthermore, these bioenergetically abnormal (NAD + very high ) cells contained higher levels of marf compared with the other TICs ( Figure 5 F; Figure S6 A) and were the first TICs harboring fused mitochondria ( Figure 5 G, blue arrowheads). Importantly, marf RNAi almost completely abrogated formation of these bioenergetically abnormal TICs ( Figure S6 B), suggesting that mitochondrial fusion generated this metabolic state. Finally, pdp1 was also significantly enriched in NAD + very high cells ( Figure S6 C), indicating that this TF may already be required for increasing OxPhos during tumor initiation. Altogether, these results suggest that mitochondrial fusion and a bioenergetic switch precisely coincide with tumor cell immortalization in brat -deficient TICs.
To test whether the shift to OxPhos and the underlying fusion of mitochondria are indeed required for TIC immortalization, we measured how α-KGDH-E2 , UQCR-Q , and marf RNAi affected the different stages of tumor initiation. After 24 h of brat RNAi , α-KGDH-E2 RNAi , UQCR-Q RNAi , and marf RNAi , TICs behaved similarly as control TICs and failed to repress dpn ( Figure 6 A). After 48 h of brat RNAi , control TICs immortalized and started proliferating ( Figure 6 B, second column, yellow arrowheads). In sharp contrast, at the same time point, OxPhos- and marf -deficient TICs stacked but failed to start proliferation as efficiently ( Figures 6 B–6D). After 72 h of brat RNAi , control tumor cells were largely proliferative and had expanded beyond their original lineage in the brain ( Figure 6 C). At the same time point, α-KGDH-E2 -, UQCR-Q -, and marf -deficient TICs kept stacking and mostly failed to re-initiate cell division ( Figures 6 C and 6D).
Finally, unrestrained brat RNAi -mediated tumorigenesis led to highly proliferative (PH3 + ) gigantic brain expansion ( Figure 6 E). In contrast, α-KGDH-E2 -, UQCR-Q -, marf -, and sesB -deficient brat RNAi NBII lineages kept producing intermediate progenitors that mostly failed to re-initiate cell division (PH3 − ) and did not affect overall brain size. Unlike healthy NBII lineages, however, these NBII lineages failed to generate fully differentiated (Miranda-negative) smaller-sized progeny. Instead, nonproliferative TICs kept stacking in these NBII lineages that were no longer clearly separated.
Finally, to understand how increased OxPhos promotes tumor cell immortalization, we tested the possibility that release of ROS generated by OxPhos could be required to initiate tumorigenesis. Indeed, brat tumors exhibit significantly more ROS than normal NBIIs ( Figures S7 A and S7B). Importantly however, depleting ROS by treating larvae initiating brat tumors with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine for 72 h did not alter or promote tumor initiation ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Furthermore, overexpressing the Superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 similarly did not affect brat RNAi tumor formation ( Figures S7 E and S7F). To further decipher OxPhos function during tumorigenesis, we investigated whether OxPhos-dependent NAD + metabolism was sufficient to sustain tumorigenesis independent of ATP synthesis. Strikingly, overexpressing the proton-pump-independent yeast mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1 ( Sanz et al., 2010 60. Sanz, A. ∙ Soikkeli, M. ∙ Portero-Otín, M. ... Expression of the yeast NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1 in Drosophila confers increased lifespan independently of dietary restriction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :9105-9110 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ) in ATP synthase-reduced brat tumors was sufficient to fully restore tumorigenesis ( Figures 7 A–7D). These results suggest that NAD + metabolism, rather than ATP or ROS production from this increased oxidative metabolism, is primarily required by brat RNAi TICs to immortalize. Altogether, these results indicate that a metabolic switch to OxPhos and higher NAD + metabolism induced by uncontrolled mitochondrial fusion is the rate-limiting step for irreversible immortalization of NSCs during tumor formation ( Figure 7 E).

Section: Discussion

The potential to divide indefinitely and to ignore organismal proliferation control signals is a key hallmark of tumor cells. Several cellular processes have been shown to play a crucial role in the transition: telomere stabilization by telomerase ( Shay and Wright, 2011 62. Shay, J.W. ∙ Wright, W.E. Role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer Semin. Cancer Biol. 2011; 21 :349-353 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ), sustained and deregulated proliferation control signaling pathways ( Feitelson et al., 2015 24.

Evading apoptosis in cancer Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23 :620-633 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (437) PubMed Google Scholar ). Metabolic reprogramming has been widely considered an adaptation to the environment when the tumor has been formed or during metastasis but has not been described as a primary feature of tumor cell immortalization ( DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016 18. DeBerardinis, R.J. ∙ Chandel, N.S. Fundamentals of cancer metabolism Sci. Adv. 2016; 2 :e1600200 Crossref Scopus (1949) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results indicate that a metabolic switch toward OxPhos and increased NAD + biogenesis driven by glutamine incorporation is rate limiting for the immortalization of stem cells during tumor initiation in Drosophila brain tumors. Moreover, extensive fusion of mitochondria induces a change in OxPhos in TICs to trigger transition into tumor cells. Our data support the idea that, like other changes of fate ( Tatapudy et al., 2017 64. Tatapudy, S. ∙ Aloisio, F. ∙ Barber, D. ... Cell fate decisions: emerging roles for metabolic signals and cell morphology EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 :2105-2118 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), immortalization is a dramatic and irreversible event in a cell that requires abrupt metabolic changes.
Unlike other described Drosophila tumor models, brat NSC-derived tumors originate from a glycolytic lineage and adapt into oxidative cells strictly relying on oxygen and mitochondrial NAD + production. There is strong evidence supporting a key role of OxPhos in various mammalian tumor types ( Franco et al., 2016 28. Franco, J. ∙ Balaji, U. ∙ Freinkman, E. ...

Imp2 controls oxidative phosphorylation and is crucial for preserving glioblastoma cancer stem cells Genes Dev. 2012; 26 :1926-1944 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that this tumorigenic feature is evolutionarily conserved from arthropods to humans. The key role of OxPhos in tumor cell proliferation in Drosophila NSC-derived tumors is also supported by a recent report ( van den Ameele and Brand, 2019 69. van den Ameele, J. ∙ Brand, A.H. Neural stem cell temporal patterning and brain tumour growth rely on oxidative phosphorylation eLife. 2019; 8 :859 Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar ). Although this work did not specifically address the role of metabolic reprogramming during tumor cell immortalization, together our conclusions indicate a fundamental role of OxPhos in deregulation of cell proliferation programs.
Intriguingly, a molecularly distinct switch to oxidative metabolism has been described in Drosophila NSCs but in a very different context: when NSCs exit proliferation ( Homem et al., 2014 33. Homem, C.C.F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Burkard, T.R. ... Ecdysone and mediator change energy metabolism to terminate proliferation in Drosophila neural stem cells Cell. 2014; 158 :874-888 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been described previously that NSCs transcriptionally upregulate TCA and ETC enzymes during pupal stages and that this is required for timely exit from the cell cycle. Although superficially similar, the metabolic switch during pupal stages is not accompanied by altered mitochondrial morphology and is instead triggered by increased levels of TCA or ETC enzymes. Furthermore, it has requirements for metabolic pathways that are different from the one we describe here; although complex II and flavoproteins fueling the ETC with reduced forms of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH) are key to prevent NB regrowth and to end proliferation in normal NBs, they are fully dispensable for tNB proliferation. Overall, these combined observations suggest that two distinct pathways can increase OxPhos in NSCs and that their relative role is context dependent. When NSCs exit proliferation, they do so by increasing the levels of respiratory enzymes and utilizing the complete ETC to increase ATP production. When immature TICs are immortalized, however, they do so by enhancing mitochondrial membrane fusion and shortcutting ETC complex II to critically increase mitochondrial NAD + synthesis. Interestingly, complex II has already been described to be non-essential for respirasome formation in other contexts ( Jang and Javadov, 2018 36. Jang, S. ∙ Javadov, S. Elucidating the contribution of ETC complexes I and II to the respirasome formation in cardiac mitochondria Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :17732 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our discovery that mitochondrial fusion and increased mitochondrial NAD + production are key for triggering tumor cell immortalization and inducing mitosis is fundamentally unexpected and surprising. In fact, multiple previous reports have suggested the opposite ( Lee et al., 2013 46. Lee, K.S. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Song, Y. ... Roles of PINK1, mTORC2, and mitochondria in preserving brain tumor-forming stem cells in a noncanonical Notch signaling pathway Genes Dev. 2013; 27 :2642-2647 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peiris-Pagès et al., 2018 55. Peiris-Pagès, M. ∙ Bonuccelli, G. ∙ Sotgia, F. ... Mitochondrial fission as a driver of stemness in tumor cells: mDIVI1 inhibits mitochondrial function, cell migration and cancer stem cell (CSC) signalling Oncotarget. 2018; 9 :13254-13275 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ; Senft and Ronai, 2016 61. Senft, D. ∙ Ronai, Z.A. Regulators of mitochondrial dynamics in cancer Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 39 :43-52 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mitochondrial dynamics (fragmentation and fusion) have already been shown in a very different system to be instructive and critical for cell fate decision between effector (fragmented mitochondria) and memory (fused mitochondria) T cells ( Buck et al., 2016 10. Buck, M.D. ∙ O’Sullivan, D. ∙ Klein Geltink, R.I. ... Mitochondrial Dynamics Controls T Cell Fate through Metabolic Programming Cell. 2016; 166 :63-76 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (967) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this case, however, in memory T cells as well as in other biological contexts, such as in neurons ( Beckervordersandforth, 2017 1. Beckervordersandforth, R. Mitochondrial Metabolism-Mediated Regulation of Adult Neurogenesis Brain Plast. 2017; 3 :73-87 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) or oxidative muscle fibers ( Mishra and Chan, 2016 49. Mishra, P. ∙ Chan, D.C. Metabolic regulation of mitochondrial dynamics J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :379-387 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ), the combination of mitochondrial fusion and increased OxPhos has been associated with longer-lived and non-dividing cells. Only a recent report in fibroblasts ( Yao et al., 2019 78. Yao, C.-H. ∙ Wang, R. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Mitochondrial fusion supports increased oxidative phosphorylation during cell proliferation eLife. 2019; 8 :279 Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar ) associated mitochondrial fusion and increased OxPhos with actively dividing cells, which, in this case, provides enhanced aspartate production. Therefore, our study provides the first strong evidence showing that OxPhos and mitochondrial fusion can be potent proliferative mechanisms in multiple cellular contexts.
How could this increased oxidative and NAD + metabolism contribute to tumor cell immortalization? First, our results indicate that Got1 and Got2 are not required for tumorigenesis. This argues against a key role of TICs’ increased OxPhos and NAD + pool to promote biosynthesis of aspartate and subsequent anabolism of nucleotides. More generally, it seems unlikely that the main role of increased OxPhos in TICs is to promote anabolism because brat tumor cells divide at a similar or even slower pace than normal type II NBs ( Homem et al., 2014 33. Homem, C.C.F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ∙ Burkard, T.R. ... Ecdysone and mediator change energy metabolism to terminate proliferation in Drosophila neural stem cells Cell. 2014; 158 :874-888 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Instead, it is tempting to speculate that the increased NAD + pool observed in TICs is required for signaling during the long quiescent period enabling TIC immortalization. Indeed, NAD + is a well-described co-factor regulating poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-mediated poly-ADP ribosylation and Sirtuin-mediated deacetylation, which are known to influence chromatin plasticity, genome stability, and cell fate ( Hottiger, 2015 34. Hottiger, M.O. Nuclear ADP-Ribosylation and Its Role in Chromatin Plasticity, Cell Differentiation, and Epigenetics Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84 :227-263 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). It will therefore be of utmost interest to investigate the potential role of NAD + in these pathways specifically during tumor cell immortalization.
Importantly, our data based on RNAi cannot completely exclude a role of glycolysis and fermentation in the tumor process. However, the higher tumor burden observed upon GAPDH , PGK , or LDH depletion argues that they would be detrimental to tumor development despite LDH being one of the most transcriptionally upregulated genes in tNBs and their preferential use of pyruvate for fermentation. Interestingly, the dispensability of high LDH levels in tumors has also been observed recently in squamous cell carcinoma ( Flores et al., 2019 27. Flores, A. ∙ Sandoval-Gonzalez, S. ∙ Takahashi, R. ... Increased lactate dehydrogenase activity is dispensable in squamous carcinoma cells of origin Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :91 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the question of why such high levels of tumor-expressed glycolytic and fermenting enzymes ( HexA and LDH ) transcript levels do not result in lactate accumulation or increased acidity. One possibility suggested by other tumor models ( Brisson et al., 2016 9. Brisson, L. ∙ Bański, P. ∙ Sboarina, M. ... Lactate Dehydrogenase B Controls Lysosome Activity and Autophagy in Cancer Cancer Cell. 2016; 30 :418-431 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ; Faubert et al., 2017 23. Faubert, B. ∙ Li, K.Y. ∙ Cai, L. ... Lactate Metabolism in Human Lung Tumors Cell. 2017; 171 :358-371.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (851) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hui et al., 2017 35. Hui, S. ∙ Ghergurovich, J.M. ∙ Morscher, R.J. ... Glucose feeds the TCA cycle via circulating lactate Nature. 2017; 551 :115-118 Crossref Scopus (1068) PubMed Google Scholar ) is that a fraction of the tNB LDH levels would catalyze the opposite reaction to create pyruvate out of lactate and fuel the TCA cycle. Furthermore, the elevated levels of the PPP intermediates D-erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate observed in brat tumors could reveal an enhanced nucleotide biosynthesis strategy to which high levels of glycolytic enzymes and PDK may also contribute.
Our results shed light on uncharacterized events during the long transition of a TIC converting into an ectopic tNB. Other NB factors have been implicated in the earliest stages that initiate the tumorigenesis process (such as dpn and zld in a brat context; Reichardt et al., 2018 58. Reichardt, I. ∙ Bonnay, F. ∙ Steinmann, V. ... The tumor suppressor Brat controls neuronal stem cell lineages by inhibiting Deadpan and Zelda EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :102-117 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these factors can undoubtedly affect tumorigenesis, they also have important functions in normal NSC proliferation and development and, therefore, cannot fully and unambiguously explain the tumorigenic process. In contrast, our results show a strictly tumor-specific process that is independent of the tumor-triggering mutation and that regulates the later step of tumor initiation. OxPhos is not required for dpn mis-expression in brat -deficient TICs; therefore, inhibiting OxPhos did not rescue the accumulation of TICs. Instead, TICs switched to OxPhos only later, when it was required for their immortalization and conversion into tNBs.
Is OxPhos only required during tumor initiation or can it also play a broader role during tumorigenesis? Our results indicate that established tumors are oxidative even at later stages and that reducing oxygen concentration can prevent the growth of already established tumors. Furthermore, scRNA-seq clearly associated the most proliferative cell population with higher transcriptional levels of OxPhos-associated genes. This strongly argues that this bioenergetic switch has to be maintained long after tumor initiation to sustain growth of the tumor.
Finally, what are the molecular mechanisms driving mitochondrial fusion and the oxidative metabolic switch of the immortalizing tumor cells? It seems unlikely that Brat or Notch pathway direct transcriptional targets are responsible for these changes; most of them are widely expressed and required in NBs, which undertake very distinct metabolic routes. Instead, it seems more likely that TICs develop their own transcriptional program during their long quiescent phase of cellular transformation to induce this metabolic change. Identifying these regulatory mechanisms and analyzing their significance for mammalian tumor cell immortalization will be of utmost interest.

Finally, two stocks were generated in this study: UAS-SoNar (integrated into the attP40 landing site on chromosome II, see Cloning section below) and UAS-marf (DGRC vector UFO07767 ( UAS-marf-Flag-HA fusion) integrated into the attP40 landing site on chromosome II).
Fly culture and crosses were performed according to standard procedures. Flies were raised on a standard molasse cornmeal medium (494 g agar, 1646 g unhopped malt extract, 3294 g malt extract, 1430 g molasses, 4940 g cornmeal, 618 g soy flour, 1112 g dry yeast, 525 mL propionic acid 99.5%, 31 mL phosphoric acid 85% in 57.8 L of water).
All fly crosses were maintained at 25°C in 60% humidity and the resulting progeny was then transferred to 29°C in 60% humidity to boost UAS-Gal4-dependent overexpression, unless stated otherwise. Due to the crossing scheme and in order to analyze the right genotype for these analyses, only female flies were used in Figures 1 J–1M, 3 A–3G, 4 F–4I, 5 ( brat RNAi conditions only), and 7 and Figures S1 B, S2E, S3A, S4, S5A, S5D, and S5E. In all other cases, no sex selection was applied, and a mix of males and females were used for analysis. All larval brain dissections were performed on third instar wandering larvae (typically 5-6 days after egg laying at 29°C). Adult brain dissections, tumor burden and lifespan survival experiments were performed on 0-3 days old adults.
To generate UAS-SoNar (attP40), SoNar cDNA sequence was inserted into a pWALIUM10-moe ( https://plasmid.med.harvard.edu/PLASMID/GetVectorDetail.do?vectorid=498 ) (Harvard Medical School) and subsequently integrated into the attP40 landing site on chromosome II.
For each technical replicate, ∼15 control or ∼5 tumor whole brains were dissected from 6-days old 3 rd instar larvae, enzymatically dissociated (Rinaldini’s 1x solution (80mg/L NaCl, 2mg/L KCl, 0,5mg/L NaH2PO4, 10mg/L NaHCO3, D-Glucose 1g/L) supplemented with 1mg/mL Collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1mg/mL Papaïn (Sigma-Aldrich)), resuspended in 100uL Primary Schneider’s Medium (PSM) and filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer cap tube (Falcon). PSM was prepared by complementing Schneider’s Drosophila Medium (Thermo Fischer Scientific) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 20mM L-glutamine, 5 μg/ml glutathione, 20 μg/ml human recombinant insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) and penicillin/streptomycin. Cell suspension was counted on a Neubauer chamber and each 100,000 cells replicate was plated in a well of a XF24 culture microplate (Agilent Technologies, 100867-100) coated with the surfactant Cell-Tak (Thermo Fischer Scientific 10317081). Cells were allowed to settle down for 30min and 400 μL PSM was added to each well. ExtraCellular Acidification Rate (ECAR) and Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) were measured live following kit’s instructions on a Seahorse XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). For all conditions, OCR and ECAR were measured in three independent experiments, each averaging three technical replicates.
For each technical replicate, ∼100 control or ∼30 tumor whole brains were dissected from 6-days old 3 rd instar larvae, washed two times in PBS 1x to remove potential hemolymph contaminants and snap frozen in dry ice after total removal of PBS. For [U- 13 C] glucose, [U- 13 C] L-glutamine and [U- 13 C] acetate tracing, dissected brains were incubated in a modified Rinaldini’s solution (80mg/L NaCl, 2mg/L KCl, 0,5mg/L NaH2PO4, 10mg/L NaHCO3) containing 1g/L glucose, 23.5mM L-gln and 0.5mM acetate for 2h. Each isotope solution contained the same concentration of glucose, L-gln and acetate but each time with a distinct [U- 13 C] isotope. We used L-gln concentration (23.5mM) found in larval hemolymph ( Piyankarage et al., 2008 56. Piyankarage, S.C. ∙ Augustin, H. ∙ Grosjean, Y. ... Hemolymph amino acid analysis of individual Drosophila larvae Anal. Chem. 2008; 80 :1201-1207 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), glucose concentration (1g/L) commonly used in Rinaldini’s solution and corresponding to ∼10x higher concentration found in larval hemolymph ( Ugrankar et al., 2018 67. Ugrankar, R. ∙ Theodoropoulos, P. ∙ Akdemir, F. ... Circulating glucose levels inversely correlate with Drosophila larval feeding through insulin signaling and SLC5A11 Commun. Biol. 2018; 1 :110-115 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ) and sodium acetate concentration (0.5mM) commonly used for acetate metabolic tracing in cell culture ( Tumanov et al., 2016 66. Tumanov, S. ∙ Bulusu, V. ∙ Gottlieb, E. ... A rapid method for quantifying free and bound acetate based on alkylation and GC-MS analysis Cancer Metab. 2016; 4 :17 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
For each sample, 200 μL of ice-cold MeOH:ACN:H2O (2:2:1, v/v) solvent mixture was added to the brains. Brains were mechanically homogenized with a plastic pestle. Samples were vortexed for 30 s, incubated in liquid nitrogen for 1min, thawed at room temperature and sonicated for 10min three times. Samples were then incubated at −20°C for 1h and centrifuged at max speed for 10min at 4°C. Resulting supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Dry extracts were then reconstituted in 100 μL ACN:H2O (1:1, v/v), sonicated for 10min and centrifuged 15min at 13,000xg, 4°C, to remove insoluble debris. Supernatant were then transferred to HPLC vials and stored at −80°C prior to LC/MS analysis.
Each sample (5 μL) was injected onto a ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column operated with an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min and directly coupled to a TSQ Quantiva mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 15 minutes gradient (A: 95% acetonitrile 5% 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate; B: 50% acetonitrile 50% 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate) has been used for separation. Isobaric compounds have been distinguished using their retention times.
The following transitions have been used for quantitation in the negative ion mode (2.8 kV): glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P & Fru-6-P) 259 m/ z → 97 m/z , glucoseamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) 258 m/z → 97 m/z , dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (DHAP & G3P) 169 m/z → 97 m/z , 3-phosphoglycerate 185 m/z → 79 m/z , 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 167 m/z → 79 m/z , lactate 89 m/z → 43 m/z , pyruvate 87 m/z → 43 m/z , citrate 191 m/z → 111 m/z , alpha-ketoglutarate 145 m/z → 101 m/z , succinate 117 m/z → 73 m/z , fumarate 115 m/z → 27 m/z , malate 133 m/z → 115 m/z , D-erythrose-4-phosphate 199 m/z → 79 m/z , D-ribose-5-phosphate 229 m/z → 97 m/z , D-sedoheptulose-7-phosphate 289 m/z → 97 m/z , 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5′-monophosphate (AICAR) 337 m/z → 97 m/z , phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) 389 m/z → 291 m/z , serine 104 m/z →74 m/z , glutamine 145 m/z → 127 m/z , glutamate 146 m/z → 102 m/z .
For all metabolites, retention times and optimal collision energies have been measured using pure standards. Chromatograms have been interpreted using trace finder (Thermo Fisher Scientific), validating experimental retention times with the respective quality controls.
In isotopic tracing experiments and using again the above ZIC-pHILIC HPLC-MS approach, the following transitions have been used in addition to their unlabeled counterparts: pyruvate (+3 13 C) 90 m/z → 45 m/z, lactate (+3 13 C) 92 m/z → 45 m/z, malate (+2 13 C) 135 m/z → 117 m/z and (+4 13 C) 137 m/z → 119 m/z, citrate (+2 13 C) 193 m/z → 112 &113 m/z and (+4 13 C) 195 m/z → 115 & 114 m/z, 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (+3 13 C) 170 m/z → 79 m/z , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (DHAP & G3P) (+3 13 C) 172 m/z → 97 m/z and hexose-6-phosphate (+6 13 C) 265 m/ z → 97 m/z.
3 tumor or 10 control whole brains were dissected and enzymatically dissociated (see Seahorse metabolic analysis ) into 200 μL of PSM and were allowed to settle down for 30min on a 35mm micro-dish (Ibidi 81158) coated with Cell-Tak (Fisher Scientific 10317081). 1.8mL of PSM was further added to fill the dish. SoNar (SoNar-NADH excitation 405nm, emission 525nm; SoNar-NAD + excitation 488nm, emission 525nm) and nuclear RFP were imaged every 10 s using the Spinning Disk Confocal UltraView Vox Axio Observer (inverted). Vehicle (miliQ water), oxamate (10mM or 100mM final concentration), koningic acid (10 μM final concentration) or rotenone (5 μM final concentration) were added drop-by-drop directly into the dish while imaging. For FACS analysis, an identical preparation of tumor cells suspension was made. Cells were then treated with vehicle (miliW water), oxamate (10mM final concentration), rotenone (5 μM final concentration) or antimycin-A (10 μM final concentration) for 5min at RT to maximize drug efficiency and then analyzed.
Central brains (CB) from 6-7 days old wandering third instar larvae were dissected (ventral nerve cord was manually removed during the dissection procedure) and enzymatically dissociated (see Seehorse metabolic analysis) into 200 μL of PSM, filtered through. Five control ( UAS-Dcr2/+; inscGal4, UAS-CD8::GFP/+; sh-mCherry/+ ) and three tumor CBs ( UAS-Dcr2/+; inscGal4, UAS-CD8::GFP/+; sh-brat/+ ) were respectively dissected for this experiment. Cells were filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer cap tube (Falcon) and single cells were immediately FACS-sorted into 4 μL of lysis buffer [0.2% Triton X-100 complemented with 1:20 (v/v) Recombinant RNase Inhibitor (RRI, Clontech)] in 96 wells plates. Following the enzymatic dissociation (30°C), cells were always maintained at 4°C and immediately frozen at −80°C once in their recipient lysis buffer.
1 μL oligo dT primer (10 μM) and 1 μL of dNTPs mix (10mM) were added to each well. Samples were incubated at 72°C for 3min and put immediately on ice. 5.7 μL of the following reverse-transcription master mix was added: 0.5 μL SuperScript II (Invitrogen 18064-4-014), 0.25 μL RNase inhibitor (Clonetech 2313A), 2 μL SuperScript II 1 st Buffer (5x) (Invitrogen 18064-4-014), 0.5 μL DTT (Invitrogen 18064-4-014), 2 μL Betaine (5M) (Sigma 61962-50G), 0.06 μL MgCl 2 (1M) (Sigma M8266-100G), 0.2 μL Template Switching Oligos (TSO) (100 μM) (IDT) and 0.29 μL H 2 O
Samples were mixed, spin down and incubated as following: 42°C, 90min; 10x [50°C, 2min; 42°C, 2min]; 70°C, 15min. 15 μL of the following PCR master mix was added to each well: 12.5 μL Kapa Hifi Hotstart ready mix (KK2601), 0.025 μL IS Primers (IDT) and 2.475 μL H 2 O.
Samples were mixed, spin down and incubated as following: 98°C, 3min; 18x [98°C, 20 s; 67°C, 15 s; 72°C, 6min]; 72°C, 4min. 25 μL of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were added to each reaction. 8min incubation at room temperature (RT), 5min on the magnet. Supernatant was discarded. Beads were washed 2x with 100 μL of 80%–85% Ethanol. Beads were dried for 5min. 19 μL of H 2 O was added to elute the cDNA. 3min incubation at RT, 2min on the magnet. The 17 μL were transferred into a new plate. 19 μL of Tn5 Tagmentation were added into each well of a new 96w plate: 14 μL H 2 O; 4 μL 5x TAPS buffer (T5130-250G); 1 μL Tn5 ready to use (in house made). 1 μL of cDNA was then transferred to the mastermix. Incubate 7min at 55°C. Add 2 μL of 1% SDS to each well. Incubate 10min at 70°C. 22 μL of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were added to each reaction. 8min incubation at room temperature (RT), 5min on the magnet. Supernatant was discarded. Beads were washed 2x with 100 μL of 80%–85% Ethanol. Beads were dried for 5min. 12 μL of H 2 O was added to elute the cDNA. 3min incubation at RT, 2min on the magnet. 10 μL were transferred into a new plate.
Nextera primers (Sigma) (2.5 μL 7xx primer; 2.5 μL 5xx primer per well) and 15 μL Kapa Hifi Hotstart ready mix were added to each well of the plate and incubated as followed: 98°C, 10 s; 18x [98°C, 10 s; 65°C, 30 s; 72°C, 30 s]; 72°C, 5min. 30 μL of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were added to each reaction. 8min incubation at room temperature (RT), 5min on the magnet. Supernatant was discarded. Beads were washed 2x with 100 μL of 80%–85% Ethanol. Beads were dried for 5min. 19 μL of H 2 O was added to elute the cDNA. 3min incubation at RT, 2min on the magnet. 17 μL were transferred into a new plate.
Libraries were quality controlled on the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent), pooled and sequenced (50bp single-read, HiSeq 2500 Illumina Sequencing).
Raw sequencing data was processed using the PIGx RNaseq pipeline. Gene count matrices were further processed using Seurat (v 2.3) ( Butler et al., 2018 13. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6224) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wurmus et al., 2018 76. Wurmus, R. ∙ Uyar, B. ∙ Osberg, B. ... PiGx: reproducible genomics analysis pipelines with GNU Guix Gigascience. 2018; 7 :1226 Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar ). All cells with less than 200 genes were removed. PCA was performed and the top 10 principal components were used for TSNE dimensionality reduction. Potential contaminating cell types were investigated from control samples: optic lobe NBs (l(1)sc and Vsx1) and GMCs ( dpn -negative and ase -positive); however and expectedly from the FACS-sorting gate used, none was found. In the tumor samples, ase -positive (NBIs, GMCs) and dpn -negative (GMCs, neurons, glia) cells were removed (29 cells in total).
To explore tumor progression and/or heterogeneity Monocle (v2) ( Trapnell et al., 2014 65. Trapnell, C. ∙ Cacchiarelli, D. ∙ Grimsby, J. ... The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (3557) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used. Analysis was performed using standard parameters for unsupervised clustering/ordering. Cells were clustered based on global expression profile after PCA and TSNE were performed. For the observation of the control and tumor cells in the same TSNE space ( Figure 2 C) the control NBs (type I and II) were added to the CellDataSet object.
The top differential genes between the clusters were used to order the cells in pseudotime. The dimensionality reduction used to plot the cell trajectory was DDrTree. The Monocle function plot_genes_in_pseudotime was used to interrogate how specific genes behave along pseudotime. The top differentially expressed genes per cluster were determined by contrasting each cluster with all other cells in the sample.
The transcription factor list was generated by extraction based on gene ontology terms: ‘’A compendium of Drosophila transcription factors was assembled by mining genome-wide gene annotations for proteins associated with molecular function and biological process GO terms including “DNA binding” and “transcription factor.” The differentially expressed TFs across pseudotime were determine using Monocle’s function ‘differentialGeneTest’ with the ‘fullModelFormula = ∼sm.ns(Psedotime)’, then the ones with a qvalue < 0.05 were plotted using ‘plot_pseudotime_heatmap’.
RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted cells by using TRIzol LS reagent (Ambion). Ethanol-precipitated RNA samples were then used as template for cDNA synthesis (iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit, Bio-Rad). qPCR samples were prepared with Bio-Rad IQ SYBR Green Supermix and run on a Bio-Rad CFX96 cycler. Primers used are listed below: actin5C_qpcrF: GAGGCTTGCGGCATCCACGAGACCAC actin5C_qpcrR: GACAGAGTACTTGCGCTCTGGCG marf_qpcrF: AGTGCCAGGAATCGGTTAAG marf_ qpcrR: CCTGGCGGAAACGAAGAATA string_ qpcrF: GATAGGCGTTGGTATTCCTCTC string_ qpcrR: ACACAAGCGCAACATCATTATC aKGDH-E2_ qpcrF: GTCAAGGGAGAGGTCAAGATAC aKGDH-E2_ qpcrR: TCTCTACGGCAGCCTTTATTT LDH _ qpcrF: ACACCGACATCCTCAAGAAC LDH_ qpcrR: CACGGGATTGGACACCATAA pdp1_ qpcrF: CAATCCAGCCACACCAAATG pdp1_ qpcrR: CAGGCTGTTGACCAAACTATTC
For lifespan analysis, flies were collected 0-3 days after the first hatching, reared at 29°C and counted every two-three days until death.
For tumor burden analysis, bright-field, GFP and RFP pictures of living flies were taken on a Lumar fluorescence stereomicroscope / color SPOT camera. GFP autofluorescence signal was subtracted from tumor-specific RFP signal and displayed in false colors red-green-blue-cyan-magenta-yellow-white from least to most intense as merged with the bright-field signal. Alternatively, the RFP-specific signal was quantified on ImageJ from the raw intensity displayed in Measure tool on the delineated area of the fly head.
For all conditions, 0-24h old embryos were incubated for three days in normoxia (∼21% O 2 ) at 29°C in 60% humidity to initiate tumorigenesis or normal type II NB development. In the normoxic condition (“0h”), these larvae were further incubated in normoxia at 29°C in 60% humidity for three more days (six days in total) prior to brain dissection. In all hypoxic condition, these larvae were shifted instead to a hypoxic incubator (5% O 2 ) at 29°C in 60% humidity for 24, 48 or 72h. 24 and 48h hypoxia-incubated larvae were further incubated in normoxic condition for 2 and 1 more day(s) respectively prior to brain dissection. 72h hypoxia-incubated larvae were further immediately dissected. In all conditions, brains were dissected from wandering third-instar larvae.
Second-instar larvae were transferred into 10mg/mL N-acetylcysteine (NAC) containing apple-juice agar plate supplemented with 10mg/mL NAC-containing yeast paste and incubated for 72h at 29°C prior to dissection. NAC-containing plate and yeast paste was renewed every 12h.
All larval brains were dissected in PBS 1x from 6-7 days-old wandering third instar larvae grown at 29°C in 60% humidity to boost UAS-Gal4-dependent overexpression. Dissected brains were fixed in 4% PFA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS 1x, 20min at RT, washed in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS 1x (PBS-T), blocked in 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS 1x, 1h at RT or over-night at 4°C, and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution over-night at 4°C. Brains were washed five times in PBS-T, incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking solution 1h at RT or over-night at 4°C, washed five times in PBS-T and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Miranda (guinea-pig, home-made [ Eroglu et al., 2014 22. Eroglu, E. ∙ Burkard, T.R. ∙ Jiang, Y. ... SWI/SNF complex prevents lineage reversion and induces temporal patterning in neural stem cells Cell. 2014; 156 :1259-1273 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ], 1:250), anti-phosphohistone 3 Ser10 (rabbit, Millipore 06-570, 1:500), anti-Deadpan (guinea-pig, home-made [ Eroglu et al., 2014 22. Eroglu, E. ∙ Burkard, T.R. ∙ Jiang, Y. ... SWI/SNF complex prevents lineage reversion and induces temporal patterning in neural stem cells Cell. 2014; 156 :1259-1273 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ], 1:250), anti-ATP5A (mouse, abcam ab14748, 1:200) and GFP-booster (camel, Chromotek gba488-100, 1:200). Secondary antibodies used were all from the Alexa Fluor series (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Conjugated fluorophores used were Alexa-405, Alexa 488, Alexa-568 and Alexa-647. All immunofluorescence pictures were acquired with an LSM780 or an LSM880 (Zeiss) confocal microscope.
Dissected larval brains were incubated in PSM containing 5uM of Cell-ROX Green reagent (ThermoFisher C10444) for 30min at 29°C, washed 3x with PBS1x, fixed for 15min in 4% PFA, immuno-stained as previously described (Immunofluorescence). Due to Cell-ROX Green fluorescent stability and according to manufacturer’s instructions, staining and imaging must be performed within 24h.
3 tumor or 10 control whole brains were dissected and enzymatically dissociated (see Seehorse metabolic analysis) into 200 μL of PSM and were allowed to settle down for 30min on a 35mm micro-dish (Ibidi 81158) coated with Cell-Tak (Fisher Scientific 10317081). PSM was removed and replaced by 2mL of 100nM tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM) solution (ref: abcam ab228569; 1:200 in Schneider’s uncomplemented medium) for 30min. TMRM solution was removed and replaced by 2mL of 1x Live Cell Imaging Buffer (ref: abcam ab228569). TMRM signal (excitation 548nm, emission 573) was then imaged using LSM880 (Zeiss) confocal microscope (inverted). Control and tumor NBs’ TMRM signal (absolute frequency / intensity) was analyzed using the Zen software (Zeiss).
6 days AEL wandering third instar larval brains were dissected, washed in PBS1x and fixed using 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2 for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently the samples were rinsed with the same buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and embedded in Agar 100 resin. 70 nm sections (nominal thickness) were cut, post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate and examined with a FEI Morgagni 268D (FEI, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) operated at 80 kV. Images were acquired using an 11 megapixel Morada CCD camera (Olympus-SIS).
For quantifications of fluorescence intensity by microscopy ( Figures 1 Q, 4 I, 5 D, and 7 B; Figures S4 A, S4B, S5 D, S5E, S6 D–S6F, S7 B, and S7F), pictures were taken with the same confocal or epifluorescence settings and intensity was measured with NIH ImageJ. Tumor lobe volumes (V) ( Figure 3 I) were extrapolated based on the diameter of each brain lobe (d) analyzed with NIH ImageJ, and on the assumption that brain lobes are spheres, with the formula: V = (4/3) ∗ π ∗ (d/2) 3 . Mitochondrial lengths and surfaces ( Figures 4 D and 4E) were calculated by measuring the length or the area of each mitochondria with NIH ImageJ.
All p values correspond to unpaired (two-tailed) t test performed on Prism v7 (Graphpad). No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. Sample sizes for experiments were estimated based on previous experience with a similar setup that showed significance. Experiments were not randomized, and investigator was not blinded. Data are always represented as mean ± SD unless stated otherwise.
