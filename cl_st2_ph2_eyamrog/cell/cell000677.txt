Title: Structure and mechanism of human cystine exporter cystinosin


Abstract: Summary

Lysosomal amino acid efflux by proton-driven transporters is essential for lysosomal homeostasis, amino acid recycling, mTOR signaling, and maintaining lysosomal pH. To unravel the mechanisms of these transporters, we focus on cystinosin, a prototypical lysosomal amino acid transporter that exports cystine to the cytosol, where its reduction to cysteine supplies this limiting amino acid for diverse fundamental processes and controlling nutrient adaptation. Cystinosin mutations cause cystinosis, a devastating lysosomal storage disease. Here, we present structures of human cystinosin in lumen-open, cytosol-open, and cystine-bound states, which uncover the cystine recognition mechanism and capture the key conformational states of the transport cycle. Our structures, along with functional studies and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopic investigations, reveal the molecular basis for the transporter’s conformational transitions and protonation switch, show conformation-dependent Ragulator-Rag complex engagement, and demonstrate an unexpected activation mechanism. These findings provide molecular insights into lysosomal amino acid efflux and a potential therapeutic strategy.

Section: Introduction

Forty years ago, pioneering studies demonstrated carrier-mediated lysosomal cystine transport and its connection to the defect that causes cystinosis ( Gahl et al., 1982 23.

Since then, other lysosomal membrane transport systems (and linked lysosomal storage diseases) have been discovered, revealing the rich and dynamic roles membrane transport proteins play in lysosomal biology.
Lysosomal efflux transporters export (into the cytosol) the metabolites resulting from lysosomal degradation of macromolecules. These transporters usually are driven by the proton gradient across the lysosomal membrane, and their transport activities are thus tightly coupled to V-ATPase activity, which sets the acidic pH of the lysosomal lumen ( Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017 1.

Accumulating evidence suggests lysosomal amino acid transporters play critical roles maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating signaling hubs ( Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017 1.

However, despite decades of biochemical, functional, genetic, and physiological studies, the transport mechanisms of proton-coupled lysosomal amino acid efflux transporters remain unclear.
In proliferating cells, lysosomal concentrations of amino acids are generally lower than whole cells, with one remarkable exception: cystine, the oxidized dimeric form of cysteine. Cystine is ∼30-fold more concentrated in lysosomes compared with the cytosol ( Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017 1. Abu-Remaileh, M. ∙ Wyant, G.A. ∙ Kim, C. ... Lysosomal metabolomics reveals V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent regulation of amino acid efflux from lysosomes Science. 2017; 358 :807-813 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ), where it is quickly reduced into cysteine. Lysosomal cystine serves as the predominant reservoir for intracellular cysteine, the least abundant and often limiting amino acid. Cystine efflux is governed by the proton-coupled transporter cystinosin, which regulates the cytosolic level of cysteine for diverse fundamental processes, such as antioxidant glutathione synthesis and transfer RNA thiolation. During fasting, lysosomal cystine efflux mediated by cystinosin controls the cellular response to nutrient restriction through limiting TORC1 activity ( Jouandin et al., 2022 30. Jouandin, P. ∙ Marelja, Z. ∙ Shih, Y.H. ... Lysosomal cystine mobilization shapes the response of TORC1 and tissue growth to fasting Science. 2022; 375 :eabc4203 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, cystinosin is crucial both for maintaining cystine and cysteine availability and for regulating the response of signaling pathways to nutrient status ( Andrzejewska et al., 2016 4.

Cystinosin dysfunction leads to the accumulation of cystine inside lysosomes and causes cystinosis ( Gahl et al., 1982 23. Gahl, W.A. ∙ Bashan, N. ∙ Tietze, F. ...

Cystinosin is the founding member of the PQ-loop transporter family, whose members are characterized by a pair of highly conserved proline-glutamine motifs. These transporters share limited sequence similarity with transporters of known structure ( Feng and Frommer, 2016 21. Feng, L. ∙ Frommer, W.B.

They shuttle amino acids across the lysosomal membrane, playing essential roles in supporting lysosome functions, maintaining amino acid homeostasis, and transducing nutrient signaling ( Amick et al., 2020 3.

Chem. 2017; 292 :10328-10346 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cystinosin is well conserved across species ( Figure S1 ) and unique for its strict substrate selectivity for cystine ( Ruivo et al., 2012 54. Ruivo, R. ∙ Bellenchi, G.C. ∙ Chen, X. ... Mechanism of proton/substrate coupling in the heptahelical lysosomal transporter cystinosin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E210-E217 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other known lysosomal amino acid transporters, including other PQ-loop transporters, generally recognize a range of amino acids with overlapping properties ( Bröer and Bröer, 2017 7. Bröer, S. ∙ Bröer, A. Amino acid homeostasis and signalling in mammalian cells and organisms Biochem. J. 2017; 474 :1935-1963 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, PQLC2 mediates lysosomal efflux of cationic amino acids such as arginine, lysine, histidine, and ornithine ( Jézégou et al., 2012 28. Jézégou, A. ∙ Llinares, E. ∙ Anne, C. ...

Receptor-like role for PQLC2 amino acid transporter in the lysosomal sensing of cationic amino acids Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2014941118 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the molecular determinants that underlie substrate selectivity and the transport cycle of cystinosin—or any other PQ-loop transporters—have remained obscure.
Another key feature of cystinosin is transport coupling. PQ-loop transporters belong to the MtN3 clan (superfamily), which encompasses a diverse array of membrane proteins, such as SWEET sugar transporters and KDEL receptors (KDELR) ( Bräuer et al., 2019 6. Bräuer, P. ∙ Parker, J.L. ∙ Gerondopoulos, A. ...

Cystinosin, MPDU1, SWEETs and KDELR belong to a well-defined protein family with putative function of cargo receptors involved in vesicle trafficking PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e30876 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tao et al., 2015 59. Tao, Y. ∙ Cheung, L.S. ∙ Li, S. ... Structure of a eukaryotic SWEET transporter in a homotrimeric complex Nature. 2015; 527 :259-263 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, although SWEETs mediate passive transport of sugar through facilitated diffusion ( Chen et al., 2010a 10. Chen, L.Q. ∙ Hou, B.H. ∙ Lalonde, S. ... Sugar transporters for intercellular exchange and nutrition of pathogens Nature. 2010; 468 :527-532 Crossref Scopus (1126) PubMed Google Scholar ), cystinosin is a symporter that couples the transport of cystine with proton at a 1:1 ratio ( Ruivo et al., 2012 54. Ruivo, R. ∙ Bellenchi, G.C. ∙ Chen, X. ... Mechanism of proton/substrate coupling in the heptahelical lysosomal transporter cystinosin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E210-E217 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). How a proton is coupled to cystine transport is not well understood. More broadly, the fundamental question of how the transport rate of a transporter is regulated remains poorly understood. Answering this question is crucial for understanding transport mechanisms and for manipulating transport activity in translational applications. In particular, many medical and biotechnological applications would benefit from enhancing transport activity, but our limited understanding of the rate-limiting step(s) in a transport cycle has constrained our ability to devise applicable modifying strategies.
Here, we report structures of human cystinosin in lumen-open, cytosol-open, and cystine-bound states by crystallography and cryo-EM. These structures, together with functional characterizations and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) analyses, define the architecture of the PQ-loop family, provide insights into the mechanism of cystine transport, reveal an unexpected activation mechanism, and advance our knowledge on the pathogenesis of cystinosis and mTOR signaling.

Section: Results

Given purified human cystinosin is refractory to crystallization, we conducted systematic alanine scanning mutagenesis on every residue in the transmembrane (TM) domain (TMD) to identify thermostabilizing mutations. Introducing one such mutation, N301A, together with a nanobody P10 as a crystallization chaperone, yielded crystals in lipidic cubic phase that diffracted X-rays to 3.4 Å resolution ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). Overall, cystinosin resembles a Sarracenia-like structure with the luminal N-terminal domain (NTD) protruding from the TMD ( Figure 1 A). Cystinosin’s NTD adopts a β sandwich fold, resembling an immunoglobulin domain. The TMD contains seven TM helices. The N-terminal TMs 1–3 and C-terminal TMs 5–7 form two similar triple helix bundles (THBs) that are connected by an inversion linker helix, TM4 ( Figure 1 B). A large solvent-accessible cavity opens on the luminal side and extends deep into the transporter, indicating a lumen-open conformation.
In parallel, we pursued cryo-EM studies to investigate cystinosin’s main conformational states. Cystinosin-binding antibody 3H5 fragments (Fab 3H5 ) were generated to provide a fiducial mark to facilitate particle alignment. This allowed us to determine structures of wild-type (WT) human cystinosin in two conformational states ( Figure S3 ; Table S2 ). Cystinosin-Fab 3H5 purified at pH 7.5 yielded a lumen-open conformation structure at 3.4 Å resolution, which superimposes well onto the crystal structure ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Our structures, derived with two distinct techniques, cross-validate each other. In contrast, cystinosin-Fab 3H5 purified at pH 5.0 yielded a 3.2 Å resolution cytosol-open structure with pronounced conformational changes in the TMD that result in a large central cavity accessible from the cytosol ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
Structural comparisons with other transporters revealed that cystinosin’s NTD shares a similar fold to that of Niemann-Pick protein C2 (NPC2) ( Li et al., 2016 39. Li, X. ∙ Saha, P. ∙ Li, J. ... Clues to the mechanism of cholesterol transfer from the structure of NPC1 middle lumenal domain bound to NPC2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :10079-10084 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 A). Cystinosin’s TMD adopts a similar fold to eukaryotic SWEET sugar transporters and KDEL receptors, despite their low sequence similarity (∼19% and ∼23% identity to SWEET [PDB: 5CTG] and KDELR [PDB: 6I6B], respectively) and divergent functions ( Bräuer et al., 2019 6. Bräuer, P. ∙ Parker, J.L. ∙ Gerondopoulos, A. ... Structural basis for pH-dependent retrieval of ER proteins from the Golgi by the KDEL receptor Science. 2019; 363 :1103-1107 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Han et al., 2017 26. Han, L. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ Liu, M. ... Molecular mechanism of substrate recognition and transport by the AtSWEET13 sugar transporter Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10089-10094 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tao et al., 2015 59. Tao, Y. ∙ Cheung, L.S. ∙ Li, S. ... Structure of a eukaryotic SWEET transporter in a homotrimeric complex Nature. 2015; 527 :259-263 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S4 C and S4D). This supports previous predictions that they can be grouped in the same membrane protein superfamily ( Saudek, 2012 55. Saudek, V. Cystinosin, MPDU1, SWEETs and KDELR belong to a well-defined protein family with putative function of cargo receptors involved in vesicle trafficking PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e30876 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). The AlphaFold model (AF-O60931-F1) aligns well with the cytosol-open conformation (root mean square deviation, r.m.s.d. = 0.8 Å), whereas alignment with the lumen-open conformation shows significant differences (r.m.s.d. = 2.9Å) ( Figure S4 E). The above comparison illustrates both the promise and limitation of this prediction algorithm.
The NTD is unique to cystinosin among PQ-loop transporters. Removing the NTD reduced cystine transport activity by ∼70% in a cell-based uptake assay ( Figure 2 C) and severely impaired the expression and stability of cystinosin ( Figures S4 H and S4J), suggesting an important structural role. This is consistent with early discoveries that an internal deletion in the NTD is linked to cystinosis and causes protein misfolding ( Kalatzis et al., 2004 33. Kalatzis, V. ∙ Nevo, N. ∙ Cherqui, S. ... Molecular pathogenesis of cystinosis: effect of CTNS mutations on the transport activity and subcellular localization of cystinosin Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13 :1361-1371 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nevo et al., 2017 46. Nevo, N. ∙ Thomas, L. ∙ Chhuon, C. ... Impact of cystinosin glycosylation on protein stability by differential dynamic stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2017; 16 :457-468 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). The NTD makes direct but loose contact with the TMD through two interfaces ( Figure 2 D). At one interface, Q96 on NTD interacts with residues on the loop connecting TM6 and TM7 (L6–7), helping anchor the NTD in place. At the other interface, NTD residues contact the luminal loop between TM2 and TM3 (L2–3). The specific residues at this interface differ in the lumen-open and cytosol-open conformations as L2–3 undergoes an inward movement relative to L6–7 between these two conformations. Thus, it is conceivable that the NTD might affect the conformational switch of the TMD and regulate transport activity. Indeed, the NTD-TMD interface is enriched with conserved residues of the NTD ( Figure S4 B). Mutating NTD residues on the NTD-TMD interface impacted the transport activity: substitution Q96A severely impaired cystine uptake ( Figure 2 C), and several others—S64A, K65A, G95A, and T98A—reduced transport activity to varying degrees ( Figure S4 G). Among these residues, G95 is adjacent to Q96, perhaps supporting its proper configuration. T98 helps to reposition L2–3 upon the luminal gate’s opening. K65 forms electrostatic interaction with L6–7, and its neighboring residue S64 helps to position K65. Several other mutations had only modest effects on transport activity ( Figures 2 C and S4 G). Together, our structural observations and functional analyses suggest NTD-TMD communication is important for cystinosin function.
The central cavities of the lumen- and cytosol-open structures overlap in a region of the transporter closer to the cytosolic side. This area of overlap may indicate a potential substrate binding site that is alternately exposed to either side of the membrane during the transport cycle. Numerous disease-causing mutations have been identified in cystinosin ( David et al., 2019 15. David, D. ∙ Princiero Berlingerio, S. ∙ Elmonem, M.A. ... Molecular basis of cystinosis: geographic distribution, functional consequences of mutations in the CTNS gene, and potential for repair Nephron. 2019; 141 :133-146 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), and they are enriched in these central cavity-lining residues ( Figure 3 D), consistent with their important functional roles ( Kalatzis et al., 2004 33. Kalatzis, V. ∙ Nevo, N. ∙ Cherqui, S. ... Molecular pathogenesis of cystinosis: effect of CTNS mutations on the transport activity and subcellular localization of cystinosin Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13 :1361-1371 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 G).
To gain insights into how cystinosin specifically recognizes cystine, we determined the cryo-EM structure of cystine-bound cystinosin at 3.4 Å resolution ( Figures S3 G–S3J; Table S2 ). An elongated extra density was found at the bottom part of the central cavity. This density was absent in the apo structures (determined without cystine), and the shape matches cystine ( Figure 3 A). Thus, we attribute this density to cystine. This structure superimposes well onto that of the apo lumen-open state ( Figure 3 B), representing a substrate-bound, lumen-open state.
Multiple cavity-lining residues interact with the amino acid moieties on both ends of cystine ( Figure 3 C). One-amino-acid moiety occupies a central region of the binding pocket and interacts with K273, K280, Y281, and D305; the other inserts into the bottom of the binding pocket and interacts with N166 and N301. W138 forms a hydrogen bond with D305, which stabilizes its conformation to interact with cystine, and is in close range to cystine. F142 and F170 are also in range to form hydrophobic interactions with cystine around its disulfide bridge, in a similar fashion as that of other soluble cystine-binding proteins ( Bulut et al., 2012 8. Bulut, H. ∙ Moniot, S. ∙ Licht, A. ... Crystal structures of two solute receptors for L-cystine and L-cysteine, respectively, of the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae J. Mol.

Structural and biochemical analyses of Microcystis aeruginosa O-acetylserine sulfhydrylases reveal a negative feedback regulation of cysteine biosynthesis Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1844 :308-315 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutating K273, K280, D305, W138, N166, and F142 abolished cystine transport, whereas mutating Y281, N301, and F170 substantially reduced transport activity ( Figure 2 C), corroborating our structural observations. Notably, K280 and D305 are clinically relevant as mutation of either residue causes cystinosis ( Kalatzis et al., 2004 33. Kalatzis, V. ∙ Nevo, N. ∙ Cherqui, S. ... Molecular pathogenesis of cystinosis: effect of CTNS mutations on the transport activity and subcellular localization of cystinosin Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13 :1361-1371 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Unlike many other amino acid transporters that can transport multiple amino acids with similar properties, cystinosin has a tight substrate selectivity for cystine over all canonical amino acids ( Ruivo et al., 2012 54. Ruivo, R. ∙ Bellenchi, G.C. ∙ Chen, X. ... Mechanism of proton/substrate coupling in the heptahelical lysosomal transporter cystinosin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E210-E217 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structures reveal a narrow and elongated cavity that fits well with the shape of cystine ( Figure 3 A). Importantly, cystinosin makes specific interactions with the amino and carboxyl groups on both ends of cystine, providing a “molecular ruler” that dictates the selectivity for the dimeric cystine over the monomeric canonical amino acids.
During the transport cycle, the luminal and cytosolic gates control the access of the substrate binding pocket to either side of the membrane and thus play central roles in the alternating transport mechanism. Comparing cystinosin structures in lumen-open versus cytosol-open conformations reveals key elements of the luminal and cytosolic gates. In the cytosol-open conformation, the central substrate translocation pathway is sealed from the lysosomal lumen by a luminal gate formed by a network of interacting residues, Y134, D205, and K335 ( Figure 4 A). D205 on TM3 forms a salt bridge with K335 on TM7, which brings the luminal side of N-THB and C-THB in close proximity. In addition, Y134 interacts via hydrogen bonding with D205, which helps to stabilize its interaction with K335. These interactions are specific to the cytosol-open conformation and are absent in the lumen-open conformation ( Figure 4 B). The formation of the luminal gate is associated with the repositioning of L2–3. In association with the inward tilting of TM2 and TM3 at the luminal side, L2–3 runs across the center of the mouth of the translocation pathway and shields the vestibule from the lysosomal lumen. In this conformation, L2–3 interacts with R114 on NTD and Q319 on TM6 from C-THB, which may help stabilize the closed luminal gate ( Figures 2 D and 4 A).
Substituting Y134, D205, and K335 with alanine abolished or severely impaired cystine transport activity ( Figure 4 C), as did the more conservative substitutions D205N or Y134F. This suggests the importance of the interaction network of the luminal gate. In addition, the Q319A mutation substantially reduced cystine uptake, pointing to an important role of residues that facilitate closing of the luminal gate.
In the lumen-open conformation, the cytosolic gate seals the translocation pathway from the cytosol. The glutamine residues of the signature PQ motifs on both THBs are key in closing the cytosolic gate ( Figure 4 B). Q145 of the first PQ motif forms a hydrogen bond with backbone amides on the cytosolic loop that connects TM5 and TM6 (L5–6). The bulky sidechain of W297 on L5–6 interacts with Q284 of the second PQ motif through amide-π stacking ( Figure 4 B). Q284 is also in range to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen on the cytosolic loop L1–2. Thus, the interaction network mediated by Q145 and Q284 brings L1–2 on N-THB and L5–6 on C-THB in close proximity at the entrance of the central cavity, shielding the cavity from the cytosolic solvent. In addition, W297 on L5–6 inserts its indole ring into the central cavity, which helps occlude the translocation pathway.
To probe the roles of the key residues that form the cytosolic gate, we assayed the effect of Q145A and Q284A. Both variants showed clearly enhanced cystine uptake activity with a reduction in the Michaelis constant ( K m ) and an increase in the maximum velocity ( V max ) ( Figure 4 D). These gain-of-function mutations reveal the important functional impact of weakening cytosolic gate formation by breaking the interactions mediated by Q145 or Q284. Intriguingly, this has the opposite effect to weakening the luminal gate formation ( Figure 4 C).
Notably, besides mediating cytosolic gate formation, the PQ motifs also facilitate conformational transitions. In transition from the lumen-open to cytosol-open conformation, the cytosolic portion of TM5 undergoes a large outward movement around the kink at P283 of the second PQ motif. Concomitantly, the cytosolic portion of TM1 also moves outward around a kink near P144 ( Figure S4 F). These conformational changes lead to a pronounced outward movement of L1–2 and L5–6 to unblock the translocation pathway and significantly enlarge the cytosolic entrance. Thus, the PQ motifs are central to linking the conformational switch to cytosolic gate formation, revealing the functional significance of the signature PQ motif that defines this family of transporters.
Transporters typically oscillate between outward (lumen)-facing and inward (cytosol)-facing conformations to achieve alternating access transport. To gain insights into cystinosin’s conformations and the role of gates in shaping conformational states, we carried out DEER spectroscopic studies, which measure the distance distribution of spin-labeled cysteine pairs that were introduced into a cysteine-free background of cystinosin. Two pairs of reporter positions were chosen to monitor cystinosin’s conformational states: the cytosolic pair at the cytosolic end of TM3 and TM7 and the luminal pair at the luminal end of TM3 and TM6 ( Figure 5 A). Both pairs are expected to undergo significant distance changes between lumen- and cytosol-open conformations based on our structures. For WT cystinosin, both pairs show distance distributions that include features of the simulated distance distributions based on both lumen-open and cytosol-open structures ( Figures 5 B and S5 A–S5C), indicating that both cytosol-open and lumen-open conformations are populated in cystinosin in solution.
Substitutions of key luminal gate residues—D205N, K335A, and Y134A—shifted the distance distribution of the cytosolic pair toward the shorter distance, indicating a predominantly closed conformation at the cytosolic side ( Figures 5 C and S5 A–S5C). For the luminal pair, all these mutations led to a predominantly long-distance distribution, indicating mostly an open conformation at the luminal side. A closed conformation on the cytosolic side, in conjunction with an open conformation on the luminal side, matches well with a transporter in a lumen-open conformation. Therefore, the luminal gate mutations of cystinosin favor the lumen-open conformation. In contrast, cytosolic gate mutations, Q145A or Q284A, shifted the distance distribution of the cytosolic pair toward the longer distance and the luminal pair toward the shorter distance ( Figures 5 D and S5 A–S5C), consistent with structural features of cystinosin in a cytosol-open conformation. Thus, cytosolic gate mutations favor a cytosol-open conformation. These results suggest interactions at either the luminal gate or the cytosolic gate can maintain or drive closure of the respective gate and play critical roles in conformational switch of cystinosin.
Cystinosin is a proton-coupled symporter that harnesses the lysosomal proton gradient to facilitate cystine efflux ( Kalatzis et al., 2001 32. Kalatzis, V. ∙ Cherqui, S. ∙ Antignac, C. ... Cystinosin, the protein defective in cystinosis, is a H(+)-driven lysosomal cystine transporter EMBO J. 2001; 20 :5940-5949 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ruivo et al., 2012 54. Ruivo, R. ∙ Bellenchi, G.C. ∙ Chen, X. ... Mechanism of proton/substrate coupling in the heptahelical lysosomal transporter cystinosin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E210-E217 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a cell-based uptake assay where cystinosin was redirected to plasma membrane, the uptake activity increases with a decrease of extracellular pH ( Kalatzis et al., 2001 32. Kalatzis, V. ∙ Cherqui, S. ∙ Antignac, C. ... Cystinosin, the protein defective in cystinosis, is a H(+)-driven lysosomal cystine transporter EMBO J. 2001; 20 :5940-5949 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate how a proton is coupled to the conformational switch of cystinosin, we monitored distance distributions across ten titration steps between pH 5.0 and 9.5 ( Figures 6 A, 6B, and S5 D–S5F). At a high pH, the long-distance distribution of the luminal pair and the short-distance distribution of the cytosolic pair indicates cystinosin is predominantly in a lumen-open conformation. As the pH decreased, the distance distribution of the cytosolic pair shifted toward the long distance, whereas that of the luminal pair shifted toward the short distance, suggesting that protonation of cystinosin favors cytosol-open conformations. At a low pH, cystinosin is predominantly in a cytosol-open conformation. During the titration, the distance distributions of the luminal and cytosolic pairs showed an overall inverse correlation. This is consistent with the negatively coupled luminal and cytosolic gates, which is important to achieve alternating access transport.
To pinpoint the molecular determinant responsible for the proton-induced conformational switch, we examined all acidic residues along the translocation pathway, including D205, D305, and D346. Each aspartate was mutated to asparagine to mimic the protonated state, and their distance distributions were measured at pH 5.2 (to favor protonation) and pH 7.4 (to favor deprotonation) ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S5 A–S5C). D205N substitution caused opening of the luminal side and closing of the cytosolic side in a pH-independent manner, which are opposite to proton-induced changes observed in WT. Given the critical role of D205 in the luminal gate formation, D205N should impair the luminal gate formation and favor the lumen-open conformation.
Asparagine substitution of D305, a previously proposed proton-binding site, showed a pH-dependent conformational switch similar to WT. In both cases, lowering the pH shifted the population toward the cytosol-open conformation, although D305N was biased toward a lumen-open conformation at pH 7.4. Thus, D305 does not seem to mediate the pH-dependent conformational switch directly, despite its importance for proton transport ( Ruivo et al., 2012 54. Ruivo, R. ∙ Bellenchi, G.C. ∙ Chen, X. ... Mechanism of proton/substrate coupling in the heptahelical lysosomal transporter cystinosin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E210-E217 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neutralizing D346 abolished the pH-dependent conformational switch, as shown by nearly identical distance distributions at both pH values. Importantly, distance distributions of D346N at pH 7.4 predominantly show the long distance on the cytosolic side and short distance on the luminal side, which recapitulates the distance distributions of WT at pH 5.2. Hence, we postulate that D346 is a key protonation site for the proton-dependent conformational transition of cystinosin.
To probe cystinosin’s conformation under a condition that better mimics the lysosomal environment, we aimed to carry out DEER studies on cystinosin reconstituted into liposomes with asymmetric pH across the membrane. Given that cystinosin reconstituted into liposomes yielded a mixed orientation ( Figure S6 D), we developed a strategy to release spin labels on the liposome exterior with the mild and membrane-impermeable reducing reagent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) ( Cline et al., 2004 14. Cline, D.J. ∙ Redding, S.E. ∙ Brohawn, S.G. ... New water-soluble phosphines as reductants of peptide and protein disulfide bonds: reactivity and membrane permeability Biochemistry. 2004; 43 :15195-15203 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Deutschmann et al., 2022 16. Deutschmann, S. ∙ Rimle, L. ∙ von Ballmoos, C. Rapid estimation of membrane protein orientation in liposomes ChemBioChem. 2022; 23 :e202100543 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), which breaks the spin label disulfide attachment. As a result, subsequent to background correction, only proteins with spin labels on the liposome interior are EPR DEER detectable ( Figure S6 F). Under our experimental conditions, the reconstituted liposomes showed a proton gradient across the membrane ( Figures S6 B and S6C) with negligible TCEP permeability ( Figure S6 E). Continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) kinetic studies showed a bi-exponential release of free spin labels by TCEP ( Figures S6 G and S6H), indicating that TCEP preferentially removed spin labels outside liposomes.
We measured the distance distributions of the luminal spin label pair inside liposomes under a lysosome-like environment (pH 5.2 “inside” and pH 7.4 “outside”). For WT cystinosin, we observed distance distributions representative for both lumen-open and lumen-closed states, indicating the co-existence of more than one major conformational state under physiological conditions ( Figure S6 I). In a control experiment, WT cystinosin with symmetrical pH inside and outside of liposomes undergoes pH-induced conformational transitions and favors the cytosol-open state at a low pH ( Figure S6 A), recapitulating observations on samples in micelles. Compared with the symmetric pH 7.4 condition, the lower luminal pH experienced by WT cystinosin resulted in a decrease in the long-distance distribution and an increase in the short-distance distribution of the luminal reporter pair, suggesting the lower luminal pH favors a closed conformation at the luminal side. The direction of the shift of distance distribution matches with that derived from lowering pH symmetrically, whereas the degree of the shift is less. We also examined the luminal distance distributions of three key D-to-N mutants under the same pH gradient ( Figure S6 I). D305N shows a mixed population of long- and short- distance distributions. In contrast, D346N and D205N show predominantly short- and long-distance distributions, respectively, the same as what we observed in micelles with a uniform pH. These results are consistent with observations on samples in micelles, corroborating these residues’ proposed roles in shaping conformational transitions.
Cystinosin regulates the mTOR pathway through its cystine transport activity and binding to the Ragulator-Rag complex ( Andrzejewska et al., 2016 4. Andrzejewska, Z. ∙ Nevo, N. ∙ Thomas, L. ... Cystinosin is a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase-Ragulator-rag complex controlling mammalian target of rapamycin Complex 1 signaling J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27 :1678-1688 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jouandin et al., 2022 30. Jouandin, P. ∙ Marelja, Z. ∙ Shih, Y.H. ... Lysosomal cystine mobilization shapes the response of TORC1 and tissue growth to fasting Science. 2022; 375 :eabc4203 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the molecular basis for the engagement between cystinosin and the Ragulator-Rag complex is unclear. An intriguing observation was that the N288K substitution suppresses cystinosin’s interaction with the Ragulator-Rag complex ( Andrzejewska et al., 2016 4. Andrzejewska, Z. ∙ Nevo, N. ∙ Thomas, L. ... Cystinosin is a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase-Ragulator-rag complex controlling mammalian target of rapamycin Complex 1 signaling J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27 :1678-1688 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) (also see Figure 7 A). Based on our structures, N288 is located near the cytosolic end of TM5 and is not on the exterior surface of the protein. Conceivably, N288K may induce structural/conformational changes in cystinosin and impact its interaction with the Ragulator-Rag complex. We thus determined the cryo-EM structures of N288K at pH 5.0 and pH 7.5 (3.0- and 3.1-Å resolution, respectively) ( Figures 7 B and S7 ). It turns out that N288K adopts a cytosol-open conformation at both pH values, which matches very closely to the cytosol-open structure of WT at pH 5.0 ( Figure 7 B). Notably, the residue N288K forms a π-cation interaction with F349 to confine the cytosolic gate to an open state ( Figure 7 B). These results suggest that N288K favors the cytosol-open conformation. Corroborating this, our DEER studies reveal that N288K predominantly shows a long distance for the cytosolic reporter pair and a short distance for the luminal reporter pair at both pH values ( Figures 6 E and 6F).
We noted that although N288K abolished cystine transport ( Figure S4 G), other variants that favor cytosol-open conformation, such as D346N, caused gain of function with enhanced activity ( Figure 4 C). This raises the question whether the N288K variant is trapped in a cytosol-open conformation. We thus carried out cysteine accessibility studies on reporter cysteine residues that were introduced at locations accessible in either lumen- or cytosol-open conformations ( Figure 7 C). For N288K, the cytosolic reporter cysteine (Y281C) was fully accessible, but the luminal reporter (S312C) only showed around background-level accessibility ( Figure 7 D). This suggests the N288K variant is trapped in a cytosol-open conformation and its ability to go through the transport cycle is crippled, which explains its loss of function. In contrast, for D346N (gain of function, favors cytosol-open), D205N (loss of function, favors lumen-open), and D305N (loss of function, pH-dependent conformations), both cytosolic and luminal cysteine reporters were accessible ( Figure 7 D). Our co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) results confirmed that N288K disrupts cystionosin’s interaction with V-ATPase, RagA/C, and p18 (a component of Ragulator) ( Andrzejewska et al., 2016 4. Andrzejewska, Z. ∙ Nevo, N. ∙ Thomas, L. ... Cystinosin is a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase-Ragulator-rag complex controlling mammalian target of rapamycin Complex 1 signaling J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27 :1678-1688 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ); in contrast, D205N, D305N, and D346N showed much less pronounced effects on the interaction ( Figure 7 A). These results suggest that cystinosin trapped in a cytosol-open conformation does not interact with the Ragulator-Rag complex and conformational state(s) other than cytosol-open is likely required for recruitment of the Ragulator-Rag complex to regulate mTOR signaling. Elucidating the exact nature of this interaction awaits further work.

Section: Discussion

Our structural and biophysical studies provide a molecular blueprint for mechanistic interpretation of disease-causing mutations in cystinosis. Many mutations line the substrate translocation pathway, and mutations that affect state transitions or protonation also underlie cystinosis. We also found two variants (G337R and L338P) that may cause protein-folding problems ( Figure S4 J), as they replace a glycine or introduce a proline.
Between the two configurations (3 and 7 TM) of the MtN3 clan, the 3-TM transporters are better characterized structurally ( Feng and Frommer, 2016 21. Feng, L. ∙ Frommer, W.B.

Previously, only the inward-open structures were captured for the 7-TM transporters ( Han et al., 2017 26. Han, L. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ Liu, M. ...

Our work reveals the first outward (lumen)-open structure for 7-TM transporters and delivers significant insights into their transport cycle. Our cystinosin structures also represent the first for the PQ-loop family. As their name implies, the PQ-loop transporters possess a pair of highly conserved proline-glutamine repeats that were thought to be in loop regions. Our structures, however, reveal that the PQ motifs settle in the TM helices TM1 and TM5 and play key roles in conformational transitions. This presents an interesting parallel to SemiSWEET, which is a symmetrical THB homodimer. In SemiSWEET, a PQ motif on each THB controls the conformational transition in an identical fashion ( Feng and Frommer, 2015 20. Feng, L. ∙ Frommer, W.B.

Structures of bacterial homologues of SWEET transporters in two distinct conformations Nature. 2014; 515 :448-452 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, cystinosin’s two PQ motifs operate asymmetrically but cooperatively, which might allow more sophisticated regulation of the conformational switch. Eukaryotic SWEET contains conserved prolines at comparable positions ( Tao et al., 2015 59. Tao, Y. ∙ Cheung, L.S. ∙ Li, S. ... Structure of a eukaryotic SWEET transporter in a homotrimeric complex Nature. 2015; 527 :259-263 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ) but lacks glutamine residues, suggesting a distinct gating mechanism. Interestingly, KDELR, the receptor that mediates ER protein retrieval, adopts a similar architecture to cystinosin except that it retains only one PQ motif ( Figure S4 C). This difference might conceivably contribute to its inability to undergo the full conformational switch required for transport, thus facilitating its function as a receptor to retrieve ER proteins ( Bräuer et al., 2019 6. Bräuer, P. ∙ Parker, J.L. ∙ Gerondopoulos, A. ... Structural basis for pH-dependent retrieval of ER proteins from the Golgi by the KDEL receptor Science. 2019; 363 :1103-1107 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). These structural comparisons reveal shared features and distinctions among PQ-loop, SWEET, SemiSWEET, and KDELR ( Saudek, 2012 55. Saudek, V. Cystinosin, MPDU1, SWEETs and KDELR belong to a well-defined protein family with putative function of cargo receptors involved in vesicle trafficking PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e30876 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), and they provide valuable information for understanding how varied THB construction supports diverse functions with distinct mechanisms.
Oscillating between outward- and inward-open conformations is fundamental for transporters to fulfill their transport functions. Besides revealing cystinosin’s distinct states, our studies identified molecular determinants for transitions between lumen- and cytosol-open conformations. The luminal gate and the cytosolic gate both fulfill two critical functions: shielding the central substrate binding pocket from solution when they are closed and driving conformational state transitions. Disrupting gate interactions favors opening of the respective gate. Unexpectedly, we found that disrupting luminal and cytosolic gates produced opposite functional consequences: luminal gate mutations abolished or substantially reduced transport activity while cytosolic gate mutations enhanced transport activity. This implies the relative strength of the interactions at the outer and inner gates dictates transport kinetics. Moreover, these observations suggest that a facile transition to the cytosol-open conformation or an increased dwelling time in this conformation helps increase the transport activity, pointing to the rate-limiting step(s) of the transport cycle. Altogether, changes in the relative strength of luminal and cytosolic gate interactions can facilitate or hinder the transition to the cytosol-open conformation, thus dictating transport kinetics. Consistent with this, the D346N substitution, which presumably mimics a protonated cystinosin, also favors the cytosol-open conformation and increases the transport activity ( Figure 4 C), further supporting the correlation between increased cytosol-open population and enhanced transport activity. These results suggest an important role for protonation in the transport of cystine, which raises the question whether other lysosomal transporters engage protons through a similar mechanism, given their typical proton dependence. Interestingly, gate mutations in Ec SemiSWEET can increase or decrease transport activity, but in an opposite manner to cystinosin: extracellular gate mutations (equivalent to the luminal gate of cystinosin) result in increased activity ( Lee et al., 2015 36. Lee, Y. ∙ Nishizawa, T. ∙ Yamashita, K. ... Structural basis for the facilitative diffusion mechanism by SemiSWEET transporter Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6112 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is probably due to different relative energy levels of conformational states and/or mechanisms of rate-limiting steps. These results suggest that modifying the relative stability of specific conformational states through gate mutations might be a more generally applicable mechanism to regulate transport activity.
Finally, our findings on a mechanism for substantially increasing transport activity suggest that it may be possible to enhance cystinosin’s transport activity by developing conformation-selective small molecules or biologics that favor a cytosol-open conformation. This points to a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate the crippled cystine transport that underlies cystinosis. Similarly, targeting the conformational state of a rate-limiting step in a variety of other transporters may offer an applicable strategy to enhance their transport activity for important mechanistic and translational applications.
Our studies show that pH induces conformational changes in cystinosin and revealed that protonation of specific aspartate residues may shift the equilibrium to facilitate transport. Nonetheless, the proton translocation pathway awaits elucidation, and the exact mechanism of how a proton is coupled to cystine translocation represents another exciting future direction. Although we have captured the lumen-open and cytosol-open conformations, other conformational states, e.g., occluded structures, are needed to reach a comprehensive understanding of the transport cycle. Furthermore, although we have gained interesting insights into the interaction between cystinosin and the Ragulator-Rag complex, we still need to identify the nature of interaction and how it is integrated into mTOR signaling to better understand the cross-talk between amino acid efflux and cellular signal transduction.

Unique reagents generated in this study are available with a completed materials transfer agreement.
Sf9 insect cells were grown at 27 °C, with shaking at 120 rpm in ESF 921 medium (Expression Systems no. 96-001). HEK293S cells were maintained at 37 °C under 8% CO 2 , with shaking at 130 rpm in FreeStyle™ 293 expression medium (Gibco no. 12338018) supplemented with 2% FBS. HEK293T cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FCS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. The NIH/3T3 cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin at 37 °C under 8.8% CO 2 . For antibody production, hybridomas were initially cultured in plates at 37 °C under 8% CO 2 in HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine) medium. After subcloning, 3H5 producing hybridomas were cultured in HT (hypoxanthine-thymidine) medium in roller bottles at 37 °C under ambient CO 2 at a speed of 2.5 rpm. E.coli BL21 (DE3) was cultured and induced at 37 °C using isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when OD 600 reached 0.6.
For crystallization studies, the sequence encoding residues 24-362 of human cystinosin (GenBank: AAF43102.1) was cloned into a modified pEG-BacMam vector with a haemagglutinin (HA) signal sequence followed by a maltose binding protein (MBP) tag at the N terminus and a GFP-8xHis tag at the C-terminus. The optimized variant contained a thermostabilizing mutation N301A, and mutation of glycosylation sites (N36A, N41A, N51A, N66A, N84A, N104A and N107A) in the NTD. Recombinant protein was expressed using baculovirus-mediated transduction of HEK293S cells ( Goehring et al., 2014 25. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, baculoviruses were generated using Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells (Expression Systems no. 94-001S). HEK-293S GnTI - cells (ATCC no. CRL-3022) were infected with baculoviruses at a density of 3.0 × 10 6 cells per ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 hours, the culture was supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate, and transferred to 30 °C for another 48 hours before collection. Pelleted cells were washed with a hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with a cocktail of protease inhibitors and DNase I). The crude membrane was homogenized by brief sonication in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, a cocktail of protease inhibitors and DNase I), then solubilized by adding 1% (w/v) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) (Anatrace) and 0.1% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) (Anatrace). Following centrifugation, recombinant cystinosin was isolated from the supernatant by HisPur cobalt resin (ThermoScientific). The N-terminal MBP and C-terminal GFP-8xHis tag were removed by 3C protease digestion. Protein samples were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 increase column (Cytiva) in SEC buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.002% LMNG, and 0.0002% CHS.
For cryo-EM studies, full-length human cystinosin-LKG (GenBank: AAH32850.1) was cloned into pEG-BacMam with a C-terminal Flag tag. The N288K mutant was generated using two-step PCR. The protein was expressed using baculovirus-mediated transduction of mammalian HEK-293S GnTI - cells (ATCC no. CRL-3022) grown at 37 °C for 48 hours post transduction. Cells were disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF and 5 μg/mL leupeptin). After low-speed centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 1% (w/v) n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) at 4 °C for 1 hour. The lysate was clarified by another centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a Flag-M2 affinity column (Sigma-Aldrich). The resin was washed twice with wash buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% DDM. The protein was eluted by wash buffer with 100 μg/mL 3×Flag peptide. The eluate was then concentrated and purified by SEC on a Superdex 200 Increase column (Cytiva). SEC buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.06% (w/v) Digitonin (ACROS Organics) was used to obtain the apo lumen-open conformation and the N288K mutant at pH 7.5, while SEC buffer containing 20 mM sodium acetate pH5.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.06% (w/v) Digitonin was used to obtain the apo cytosol-open conformation and the N288K mutant at pH 5.0. To prepare cystine-bound cystinosin, protein samples were purified similarly with minor changes. 100 mM cystine stock was made in 1 M HCl due to its low solubility in neutral pH conditions. Buffers were supplemented with 1mM cystine immediately prior to use, yielding a final pH of ∼7.0. Cells were sonicated in lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH8.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM cystine (Alfa Asar). The SEC buffer contained 20 mM HEPES pH8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Cystine, and 0.06% Digitonin. To assemble cystinosin-Fab 3H5 complex, purified cystinosin was incubated with Fab 3H5 at a 1:1.5 molar ratio at 4 °C for 30 minutes. The mixture was then purified by SEC using the aforementioned buffers ( Figure S3 G). Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml for grid preparation.
IgG-3H5, a mouse monoclonal anti-human cystinosin antibody, was prepared by fusion of SP2-mIL6 mouse myeloma cells (ATCC no. CRL-2016) with splenic B lymphocytes obtained from BALB/c mice (n = 2) at UT Southwestern with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee #2017-102391 as previously described ( Sun et al., 2021 57. Sun, Y. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Long, T. ... Molecular basis of cholesterol efflux via ABCG subfamily transporters Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2110483118 Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were immunized with one primary and eight boosts of purified recombinant human cystinosin reconstituted in amphipols (50 μg) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) combined with Sigma Adjuvant System. Hybridomas were initially grown in HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine) medium (DMEM high glucose supplemented with 20% FBS, 10% NCTC 109, and 1% each of HAT, ITS, NEAA, NaPyr, GlutaMAX, and Pen/strep). Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened by ELISA and counter-screened by western blot to select ELISA positive, western blot negative clones. One such hybridoma, designated IgG-3H5 (subclass IgG1), was subcloned by serial dilution three times and grown up in roller bottles in HT medium (DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% NCTC 109, and 1% each of HT, ITS, NEAA, NaPyr, GlutaMAX, and Pen/strep). IgG-3H5 was then purified from the hybridoma culture supernatant by gravity-flow affinity chromatography on protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow columns (Cytiva). The Fab fragment was generated by Papain cleavage in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM cysteamine hydrochloride, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM EDTA. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 hours, the reaction was stopped by adding iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 23 mM and then incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The protein mixture was dialyzed overnight in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH7.5 and 10 mM NaCl. Fab 3H5 was further purified by a Hitrap Q column (Cytiva) and used for cryo-EM studies.
Nanobody against human cystinosin was obtained through phage display following published protocols ( McMahon et al., 2018 45. McMahon, C. ∙ Baier, A.S. ∙ Pascolutti, R. ... Yeast surface display platform for rapid discovery of conformationally selective nanobodies Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :289-296 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pardon et al., 2014 48. Pardon, E. ∙ Laeremans, T. ∙ Triest, S. ... A general protocol for the generation of Nanobodies for structural biology Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :674-693 Crossref Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ). Purified recombinant cystinosin with mutation of glycosylation sites (N36A, N41A, N51A, N66A, N84A, N104A and N107A) in the NTD was used to screen specific binders. After four rounds of selection, nanobody clones that bound to cystinosin were isolated and sequenced. Individual nanobody was expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by HisPur cobalt resin (ThermoScientific) according to the standard protocol ( Pardon et al., 2014 48. Pardon, E. ∙ Laeremans, T. ∙ Triest, S. ... A general protocol for the generation of Nanobodies for structural biology Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :674-693 Crossref Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ). Purified nanobodies were assessed by their ability of cystinosin binding through both pull-down assay and analytical SEC. Selenomethionine (Se-Met) labeled nanobody was expressed according to a standard protocol ( Doublié, 1997 17. Doublié, S. Preparation of selenomethionyl proteins for phase determination Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 :523-530 Crossref Scopus (805) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nanobody P10 and Se-Met labeled P10 were purified similarly and used for co-crystallization with cystinosin.
Cystinosin and nanobody P10 were incubated at a 1:1.5 molar ratio for 30 min and purified by SEC. Peak fractions containing cystinosin-P10 complex were concentrated to a final concentration of 60 mg/ml. Cystinosin-P10 complex was reconstituted into lipidic cubic phase (LCP) by mixing protein with monoolein (Sigma) at a 2:3 ratio (w/w) ( Caffrey and Cherezov, 2009 9. Caffrey, M. ∙ Cherezov, V. Crystallizing membrane proteins using lipidic mesophases Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :706-731 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). Crystals were grown in 12% PEG400, 80 mM Li 2 SO 4 , and 50 mM MES pH 6.0 at 20 °C. Diffraction data were collected from multiple crystals, processed with HKL2000 ( Otwinowski and Minor, 1997 47. Otwinowski, Z. ∙ Minor, W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 :307-326 Crossref Scopus (39107) PubMed Google Scholar ), and merged using XDS ( Kabsch, 2010 31. Kabsch, W. XDS Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12932) PubMed Google Scholar ). The initial molecular replacement was carried out using truncated and modified nanobody Nb80 ( Rasmussen et al., 2011 52. Rasmussen, S.G. ∙ Choi, H.J. ∙ Fung, J.J. ... Structure of a nanobody-stabilized active state of the β(2) adrenoceptor Nature. 2011; 469 :175-180 Crossref Scopus (1395) PubMed Google Scholar ) and truncated and modified portions of EcSemiSWEET ( Lee et al., 2015 36. Lee, Y. ∙ Nishizawa, T. ∙ Yamashita, K. ... Structural basis for the facilitative diffusion mechanism by SemiSWEET transporter Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6112 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) as the search models in Phaser ( McCoy et al., 2007 44. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (16083) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the complex with Se-Met nanobody, selenium atoms of Se-Met nanobody were located by MR-SAD in Phaser. Model building and refinement cycles were carried out in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 18. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural figures were prepared using PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC).
The purified cystinosin-Fab 3H5 complex samples (∼5 mg/ml) were applied to Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 400 mesh Au holey carbon grids (Quantifoil). The grids were then blotted and plunged into liquid ethane for flash freezing using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). The grids were imaged in a 300 kV Titan Krios (FEI) with a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan). Data were collected using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 43. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 0.842, 0.844, 0.83 Å/pixel. Images were recorded for 5 second exposures in 50 subframes with a total dose of ∼60 electrons per Å 2 .
The images were collected in five sessions corresponding to the sample conditions and corresponding conformations of cystinosin: apo lumen-open conformation (5258 movies from 400 mesh grids, Figures S3 A–S3C); apo cytosol-open conformation (7133 movies from 400 mesh grids, Figures S3 D–S3F); cystine-bound lumen-open conformation (4991 movies from 400 mesh grids, Figures S3 H–S3J); N288K at pH 5.0 (6642 movies from 400 mesh grids, Figures S7 A–S7C); N288K at pH 7.5 (3970 movies from 400 mesh grids, Figures S7 D–S7F). Dark subtracted images were first normalized by gain reference. Motion correction was performed using the program MotionCor2 ( Li et al., 2013 38. Li, X. ∙ Mooney, P. ∙ Zheng, S. ... Electron counting and beam-induced motion correction enable near-atomic-resolution single-particle cryo-EM Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :584-590 Crossref Scopus (1430) PubMed Google Scholar ). The contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated using CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 53. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autopicking was performed with crYOLO v1.7.6 using a general model ( Wagner et al., 2019 62. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a particle threshold of 0.2. About 0.7 – 1.5 million particles were extracted for each dataset. Subsequent 2D classification, multi-class Ab-Initio modeling, heterogenous 3D refinement, and non-uniform refinement of the best class were performed for all datasets in cryoSPARC v3.1.0 ( Figures S3 and S7 ). For the two apo conformations, further 3D classification, refinements with and without masks and Baysian polishing were performed in RELION-3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 67. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final maps for the apo conformations were then obtained with a final non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC using the polished particles from RELION-3.1.
The initial model was built de novo and then manually adjusted using COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 18. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ). Large aromatic/hydrophobic residues were assigned to facilitate the register of the transmembrane helices. In the cryo-EM structures, the densities of residues 1-24 of human cystinosin were neither resolved nor built. Residues 358-400 were also not built due to limited local resolution. The model was refined in real space using PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). For cross-validations, the final model was refined against one of the half maps generated by 3D auto-refine and the model vs. map Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curves were generated in the Comprehensive Validation module in PHENIX. PHENIX and MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010b 11. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11087) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to validate the final model. Local resolutions were estimated using cyroSPARC local resolution estimation ( Punjani et al., 2017 51. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structure Figures were generated using PyMOL ( http://www.pymol.org ) and Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 49.

Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The cystine transport activity was measured by an established cell-based uptake assay with modifications ( Cherqui et al., 2001 13. Cherqui, S. ∙ Kalatzis, V. ∙ Trugnan, G. ... The targeting of cystinosin to the lysosomal membrane requires a tyrosine-based signal and a novel sorting motif J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :13314-13321 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kalatzis et al., 2001 32. Kalatzis, V. ∙ Cherqui, S. ∙ Antignac, C. ... Cystinosin, the protein defective in cystinosis, is a H(+)-driven lysosomal cystine transporter EMBO J. 2001; 20 :5940-5949 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). WT and mutants (residues 22-362) were cloned into a pEGFP-N1 vector with an N-terminal HA signal peptide followed by a Flag epitope. Plasmids were transfected into HEK-293S cells in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). After 24 hours, cells were washed twice with 500 μl buffer A (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 5 mM Glucose). Cystine uptake was performed at room temperature for 10 min, by incubating cells with 15 μM cold cystine and 0.5 μM [ 14 C]-cystine (200 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer) in 200 μl buffer B (20 mM MES pH 5.2, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 5 mM Glucose). The reaction was stopped by two washes with ice-cold buffer A. Cells were lysed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and subjected to scintillation counting. The concentration-dependent cystine uptake was carried out by a similar procedure, with different concentrations of cold cystine supplemented in buffer B. The uptake activities of cystinosin mutants were normalized to the level of protein expressed on the plasma membrane (except G337R and L338P, which cause protein destabilization/misfolding and show no detectable surface expression). Cell-surface expression of cystinosin mutants was assessed by anti-FLAG M1 antibody staining. At 24 hours post transfection, cells were washed twice with staining buffer (buffer A supplemented with 2mM CaCl 2 ), then incubated with anti-FLAG M1 antibody labeled with Alexa647 (Alexa Fluor647 NHS Ester, Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 °C. To saturate cystinosin molecules on cell surface, 2.0 × 10 5 cells were stained with M1-647 antibody at a final concentration of 1 μM. After another two washes with ice-cold staining buffer, cells were analyzed by BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer. Experiments were repeated three times and surface-expression levels of cystinosin variants were quantified by the mean fluorescence of Alexa647 ( Figure S4 H). To assess the biochemical behavior of cystinosin mutants, cells were solubilized for 1 hour at 4 °C in solution containing 20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% DDM and 0.1% CHS. The clarified lysate was analyzed by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) and cystinosin-EGFP was monitored using excitation wavelength of 487 nm and emission wavelength of 507 nm ( Figure S4 J).
Stable cell lines were generated using lentiviruses following a previously established protocol ( Andrzejewska et al., 2016 4. Andrzejewska, Z. ∙ Nevo, N. ∙ Thomas, L. ... Cystinosin is a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase-Ragulator-rag complex controlling mammalian target of rapamycin Complex 1 signaling J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27 :1678-1688 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, human cystinosin-GFP and its related mutants including N288K, D205N, D305N, D346N were cloned into a lentiviral vector pLVX-EF1a-IRES-Puro. 5 μg of cystinosin plasmid was co-transfected with 2 μg pMD2G and 3 μg pSPAX2 (packaging plasmids) into HEK293T cells using X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent. After 24 hours, cell medium was changed from high glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FCS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin to high glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 30% FCS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . The supernatant was collected at 48 hours and 72 hours, and filtered through 0.45-μm pore size filters, yielding 7X lentiviral particles that were ready for use. NIH/3T3 cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin at 37 °C with 8.8% CO 2 . To establish NIH/3T3 stable cell lines, cells were infected with 1X lentiviral supernatant in the presence of polybrene (final concentration of 8 μg/ml). At 48 hours post-infection, cells were selected by adding puromycin to a final concentration of 1μg/ml for 2 weeks before the Co-IP assay.
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed as described previously ( Andrzejewska et al., 2016 4. Andrzejewska, Z. ∙ Nevo, N. ∙ Thomas, L. ... Cystinosin is a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase-Ragulator-rag complex controlling mammalian target of rapamycin Complex 1 signaling J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27 :1678-1688 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). NIH/3T3 cells with stably expressed cystinosin WT and mutants were collected using a cell scraper, rinsed by PBS and lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche), pH 7.5) for 30 mins. After centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min, the supernatants were quantified by a bicinchoninic acid assay. Commercial μMACS GFP Microbeads Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) was used to perform the co-IP assay. According to the manufacturer’s recommendation, 50 μl μMACS Anti-GFP microbeads were mixed with 2 mg of the input proteins for 1 hour on ice. The mixture was then applied to the μMACS separation columns equilibrated with lysis buffer, washed and eluted with the kit buffers. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against RagA (Cell Signaling Technology, 4357S), RagC (Cell Signaling Technology, 3360S), p18 (Cell Signaling Technology, 8975S), ATP6V1A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-293336), and GFP (Invitrogen, MA5-15256-HRP). Experiments were repeated three times. Similar results were obtained.
DEER sample preparation utilized a cysteine-free version of human cystinosin (22-362) with mutations C223A, C224A, C268A, and C355A. Sites of interest were mutated to cysteine for site-specific spin labeling: S203C and Y321C were selected to probe the luminal ends, and two endogenous cysteine residues C224 and C355 were employed as the cytosolic label positions. DEER constructs were expressed and purified as described in the protein expression and purification section. 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to protein eluate from the cobalt column and removed by SEC right before spin labeling. Purified protein was incubated with a 40-fold molar excess of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl-methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL, Enzo LifeScience). The labeling reaction was performed at 4 °C overnight, followed by SEC to remove unreacted MTSSL. Labeled samples were buffer exchanged into desired pH values by diafiltration using a 50 kDa concentrator. Samples were concentrated to 100-150 μM and were measured by continuous wave EPR to verify a labelling efficiency of 60% or higher. The samples were then prepared at 20 μM with 30% deuterated glycerol for DEER experiments.
Lipids consisting of 1:1:1 DOPC: DOPG: DOPE were dried under argon gas and washed twice in pentane to remove chloroform. To make preformed liposomes, lipids were resuspended at 20 mg/ml in Buffer 7.4 (10mM HEPES and 150mM NaCl at pH 7.4) or Buffer 5.2 (10mM MES and 150mM NaCl at pH 5.2), and frozen and thawed ten times in liquid nitrogen. For reconstitution, liposomes were extruded through 0.4 μm membrane filters and incubated with 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (β-OG; Anatrace) for 1 hour at 4°C. Spin-labeled cystinosin was added into liposome/β-OG mixture at a protein: lipid ratio of 1: 33 (w/w) and incubated for 2 hours at 4°C. β-OG was removed by adding 250mg/ml biobeads (BioRad) in four batches over 18 hours. The proteoliposomes were homogenized by another ten freeze-and-thaw cycles and extrusion through 0.4 μm membrane filters, and then harvested by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 g for 1 hour. To prepare samples with a proton gradient ( Figure S6 F), proteoliposomes carrying spin labeled cystinosin at S203C/Y321C were prepared in Buffer 5.2 and treated with TCEP at a cystinosin:TCEP molar ratio of 1:50. 100 mM TCEP stock solution was made in Buffer 5.2. The removal of exterior spin labels was monitored by EPR ( Figures S6 G and S6H). After 6 hours, the exterior buffer of proteoliposomes was adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1M HEPES pH7.4. Samples were flash frozen at a protein concentration of 40 μM with 10% deuterated glycerol for DEER experiments.
Cystinosin is heavily glycosylated in the NTD. To determine the orientation of reconstituted cystinosin, 10-20 μg protein in liposomes were incubated with 50 units Endo D (NEB) at 37 °C for 3 hours. The reaction was stop by 4 x SDS-loading buffer and protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel ( Figure S6 D).
The assay was adapted from fluorescence-based ion flux assay ( Feng et al., 2012 19. Feng, L. ∙ Campbell, E.B. ∙ MacKinnon, R. Molecular mechanism of proton transport in CLC Cl-/H+ exchange transporters Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :11699-11704 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S6 B and S6C). In brief, 2 μl of 100 μM cystinosin in pH 5.2 liposomes was added into 150 μl Buffer 7.4 in the presence of 2 μM 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methox-yacridine (ACMA). The fluorescence (excitation:410nm; emission: 490nm) was monitored every second. Once the fluorescence signal stabilized, 1μM proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was added. The proton gradient was collapsed with the addition of 2 μM monensin. Proteoliposomes that have been treated with TCEP were washed twice before applying to ACMA assay. Experiments were repeated three times.
20 mg/ml liposomes were loaded with 500 μM 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) by ten freeze-and-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. DTNB-loaded liposomes were extruded through 0.4 μm membrane filters and washed twice with Buffer 7.4 to remove exterior DTNB. The reduction of DTNB resulted in an increase of absorbance at 412 nm. To assess the membrane permeability of TCEP, 2 mg/ml DTNB-loaded liposomes were monitored at 412 nm every 30 seconds for 6 hours in the presence of 1 mM TCEP. β-OG solubilized liposomes were recorded to measure maximum signal of reduced DTNB ( Figure S6 E). Experiments were repeated three times.
Two cysteine reporters, Y281C and S312C, were introduced into the cysteine-free version of human cystinosin (residues 22-362) separately. WT-like cystinosin and its mutants including N288K, D205N, D305N, D346N were cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector with an N-terminal HA signal peptide and a C-terminal GFP-His tag. Plasmids were transfected into HEK-293S cells in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). After 48 hours, cells were washed twice with 1 ml Buffer A (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 5 mM Glucose) and incubated with the membrane permeable thiol-reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at a concentration of 1 mM at 37 °C for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mM cysteine. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then solubilized for 1 hour at 4 °C in solution containing 20 mM HEPES pH7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% DDM and 0.1% CHS. The clarified lysate was affinity purified by HisPur cobalt resin. Cystinosin-GFP eluate was treated with 1 mM 5K-PEG maleimide at 37 °C for 1 hour in the presence of 0.2% SDS, and 10 mM DTT was added to stop the reaction. Modified cystinosin-GFP was detected by SDS-PAGE using in-gel fluorescence. Experiments were repeated three times. Band intensities ( I ) were quantified by ImageJ. The modification efficiency of NEM was determined by I lower-band / [ I lower-band + I upper-band ].
4-pulse DEER data was collected on a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 AWG spectrometer at Q Band equipped with a QT2 resonator. The pump pulse was fixed to the center peak in the field swept nitroxide spectrum and the probe frequency was chosen 100 MHz away from this frequency. π/2 and π pulses were all 44-54 ns gaussian pulses ( Teucher and Bordignon, 2018 60. Teucher, M. ∙ Bordignon, E. Improved signal fidelity in 4-pulse DEER with Gaussian pulses J. Magn. Reson. 2018; 296 :103-111 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) depending on the available power at time of measurement. The delay between the first and second probe pulses was 400 ns and dipolar evolution data was collected out to 2.5-3.5 μs. Experiments were run at 50 K and were signal averaged for 4-16 hrs. The raw data was background corrected and analyzed by Tikhonov regularization using DEERAnalysis2019 ( Jeschke et al., 2006 27. Jeschke, G. ∙ Chechik, V. ∙ Ionita, P. ... DeerAnalysis2006—a comprehensive software package for analyzing pulsed ELDOR data Appl. Magn. Reson. 2006; 30 :473-498 Crossref Scopus (857) Google Scholar ). CW-EPR spectra of the DEER samples were recorded at room temperature with a Bruker E500 CW-EPR spectrometer operating at the X-band frequency (∼9.4 GHz) using an ER 4122SHQE resonator (Bruker).
Simulations of the DEER data were performed with MMM 2018 (2018 version available at https://epr.ethz.ch/software/older-versions/old_mmm.html ) ( Polyhach et al., 2011 50. Polyhach, Y. ∙ Bordignon, E. ∙ Jeschke, G. Rotamer libraries of spin labelled cysteines for protein studies Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2011; 13 :2356-2366 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pre-calculated spin label rotamers were modeled into the labeling site on the static protein. High energy states resulting from steric clashes with the protein backbone or side chains are excluded. Consequently, only low energy states compatible with the spin label attached to the static protein structure in the lumen-open or cytosol-open are retained. The collections of these static states represent the theoretical distribution of side chain conformers resolvable by EPR DEER measurements.
Statistical analyses of cystine uptake were performed using Prism6 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Transport data in Figure 4 D were fit into a Michaelis-Menten model. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM calculated in at least three independent experiments. Surface expression of cystinosin was quantified by mean fluorescence of Alexa647 of live single cell events via standard SSC/FSC gating using BD Accuri C6 Plus software.
