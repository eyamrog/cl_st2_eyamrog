Title: RNA-Mediated Feedback Control of Transcriptional Condensates


Abstract: Summary

Regulation of biological processes typically incorporates mechanisms that initiate and terminate the process and, where understood, these mechanisms often involve feedback control. Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular process where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied extensively, but those involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. Modeling of the potential roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a non-equilibrium feedback control mechanism where low levels of RNA promote condensates formed by electrostatic interactions whereas relatively high levels promote dissolution of these condensates. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo experiments support a model where RNAs produced during early steps in transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation, whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We propose that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback mechanism whereby transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest the process.

Section: Introduction

Diverse biological processes have evolved feedback mechanisms to enable positive and negative regulation. Examples of biological processes that are known to incorporate feedback regulation include signal transduction ( Brandman and Meyer, 2008 13. Brandman, O. ∙ Meyer, T. Feedback loops shape cellular signals in space and time Science. 2008; 322 :390-395 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ), production of RNA splicing factors ( Jangi and Sharp, 2014 50.

Dunlap, J.C. Molecular bases for circadian clocks Cell. 1999; 96 :271-290 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2322) PubMed Google Scholar ), red blood cell production ( Ebert and Bunn, 1999 34. Ebert, B.L. ∙ Bunn, H.F. Regulation of the erythropoietin gene Blood. 1999; 94 :1864-1877 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and response to DNA damage ( Lahav et al., 2004 57.

In transcription, some factors that regulate amino acid biosynthetic pathway genes can be regulated allosterically by intermediates produced by those pathways ( Bergot et al., 1992 9. Bergot, M.O. ∙ Diaz-Guerra, M.J. ∙ Puzenat, N. ...

Evidence that feedback control is often mediated by the product of the process ( Brandman and Meyer, 2008 13. Brandman, O. ∙ Meyer, T.

Transcription factors and coactivators recruit RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) to enhancer and promoter elements, where short (20–400 bp) RNAs are bidirectionally transcribed before RNA Pol II pauses ( Adelman and Lis, 2012 1.

RNA Pol II pause release leads to processive elongation, which occurs in periodic bursts (∼1–10 min in duration), where multiple molecules of RNA Pol II can be released from promoters within a short time frame and produce multiple molecules of mRNA (∼1–100 molecules per burst) ( Cisse et al., 2013 24.

How and whether the diverse RNA species produced during transcription—which differ in length, half-life, and number—affect or regulate transcription is currently unclear.
Recent studies have shown that transcriptional condensates can compartmentalize and concentrate large numbers of transcription factors, cofactors, and RNA Pol II at super-enhancers, clusters of enhancers that regulate genes with prominent roles in cell identity ( Boija et al., 2018 12.

Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall’Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The component enhancer elements of such genes promote transcriptional condensate formation by crowding transcription factors and Mediator at densities above sharply defined thresholds for condensate formation ( Shrinivas et al., 2019 104. Shrinivas, K. ∙ Sabari, B.R. ∙ Coffey, E.L. ... Enhancer Features that Drive Formation of Transcriptional Condensates Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :549-561.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcriptional condensates are highly dynamic and can be observed in live cells to form and dissolve at timescales ranging from seconds to minutes ( Cho et al., 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ). The periodic formation and dissolution of dynamic transcriptional condensates, coupled with evidence that different species and levels of RNAs are produced at different stages of transcription, led us to wonder whether transcriptional condensates are regulated by a non-equilibrium feedback mechanism mediated by its RNA product.
RNA molecules are components of and play regulatory roles in diverse biomolecular condensates. These include the nucleolus, nuclear speckles, paraspeckles, and stress granules ( Fay and Anderson, 2018 37. Fay, M.M. ∙ Anderson, P.J. The role of RNA in biological phase separations J. Mol.

RNA has a high negative charge density because of its phosphate backbone, and the effective charge of a given RNA molecule is directly proportional to its length ( Boeynaems et al., 2019 11. Boeynaems, S. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Weinhardt, V. ... Spontaneous driving forces give rise to protein-RNA condensates with coexisting phases and complex material properties Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :7889-7898 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Condensates are thought to be formed by an ensemble of low-affinity molecular interactions, including electrostatic interactions, and RNA can be a powerful regulator of condensates that are formed and maintained by electrostatic forces ( Banani et al., 2017 7.

Indeed, RNA has been shown to enter and modify the properties of simple condensates formed by polyelectrolyte-rich molecules ( Drobot et al., 2018 32.

Formation of Multiphase Complex Coacervates and Partitioning of Biomolecules within them Biomacromolecules. 2020; 21 :630-640 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a phenomenon called complex coacervation, a type of liquid-liquid phase separation mediated by electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, low levels of RNA can enhance condensate formation, whereas high levels can cause their dissolution ( Lin et al., 2019 70. Lin, Y. ∙ McCarty, J. ∙ Rauch, J.N. ...

Phys. 2016; 161 :499-544 Google Scholar ). Condensate formation and subsequent dissolution with increasing RNA concentration is an example of reentrant phase behavior, which is driven by favorable opposite-charge interactions at low RNA concentrations (formation) and repulsive like-charge interactions at high RNA concentrations (dissolution) ( Banerjee et al., 2017 8. Banerjee, P.R. ∙ Milin, A.N. ∙ Moosa, M.M. ... Reentrant Phase Transition Drives Dynamic Substructure Formation in Ribonucleoprotein Droplets Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Reentrant Phase Transitions and Non-Equilibrium Dynamics in Membraneless Organelles Biochemistry. 2018; 57 :2470-2477 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). We wondered whether such a reentrant equilibrium phase behavior coupled to the non-equilibrium processes that occur during transcription could regulate transcriptional output.
By combining physics-based modeling and experimental analysis, we propose and test a model where the products of transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation and those of a burst of elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We provide experimental evidence that physiological RNA levels can enhance or dissolve transcriptional condensates. These results show a mechanism by which the products of transcription regulate condensate behaviors and, thus, transcription and suggest that this non-equilibrium process provides negative feedback to dissolve the transcriptional condensates that support initiation and thereby arrest transcription.

Section: Results

To explore the potential role of RNA in regulating transcriptional condensates, we sought to estimate the number and effective charge of RNA and protein molecules in a typical transcriptional condensate at different stages of transcription. In early stages of transcription, low levels of small noncoding RNAs are produced by RNA Pol II at enhancers and promoter-proximal regions ( Figure S1 A; Adelman and Lis, 2012 1.

During pause release, RNA Pol II produces longer genic RNAs during bursts of transcription elongation ( Figure S1 A; Adelman and Lis, 2012 1. Adelman, K. ∙ Lis, J.T. Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13 :720-731 Crossref Scopus (743) PubMed Google Scholar ; Core and Adelman, 2019 25.

These protein- and RNA-rich states can be thought of as mixtures of poly-electrolytes that may undergo complex coacervation ( Figure 1 A; Lin et al., 2019 70. Lin, Y. ∙ McCarty, J. ∙ Rauch, J.N. ...

Phys. 2016; 161 :499-544 Google Scholar ). We reasoned that this phenomenon is likely to be relevant to transcriptional condensates because electrostatic interactions contribute to formation of these condensates, even in the absence of RNA ( Boija et al., 2018 12. Boija, A. ∙ Klein, I.A. ∙ Sabari, B.R. ...

Complex coacervate formation through phase separation is promoted when poly-electrolytes are present at concentrations where their net charges are approximately balanced. When the concentration of a poly-electrolyte, such as RNA, becomes sufficiently high, domination of repulsive like-charge interactions can suppress phase separation ( Banerjee et al., 2017 8.

Thus, at constant protein concentration, titrating RNA levels results in reentrant phase behavior, whereby low RNA levels promote and high RNA levels suppress condensate formation ( Figure 1 A; Banerjee et al., 2017 8.

We wondered whether the reentrant phase behavior might apply to regulation of transcriptional condensates during transcription. Because the quantities of the diverse RNA species and proteins present in transcriptional condensates in populations of cells can be estimated ( Figure S1 ; STAR Methods ), it is possible to conduct experimental tests to determine whether reentrant phase behavior occurs under physiologically relevant conditions of these molecules.
As an initial test of whether low levels of RNA stimulate transcriptional condensate formation while high levels of RNA favor condensate dissolution, we used an in vitro droplet assay ( Figure 1 B). Using components at physiologically relevant conditions, we investigated whether an enhancer RNA transcribed from the Trim28 super-enhancer, which has been shown previously to form a transcriptional condensate in living cells ( Boija et al., 2018 12. Boija, A. ∙ Klein, I.A. ∙ Sabari, B.R. ...

Pol II phosphorylation regulates a switch between transcriptional and splicing condensates Nature. 2019; 572 :543-548 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ), influences condensate formation by purified Mediator complex. Measurement of enhancer RNA levels in cells indicated that ∼0.2 molecules of this enhancer RNA exist at steady state in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) ( Figure S1 F). Given that multiple loci in a super-enhancer are transcribed into enhancer RNAs, this roughly corresponds to ∼100–1,000 nM of RNA in a typical Mediator condensate in cells ( STAR Methods ). These condensates typically contain Mediator at a concentration of around 1–20 μM ( STAR Methods ). The results showed that addition of 6–400 nM Trim28 enhancer RNA to 200 nM purified Mediator complex had a dose-dependent effect on the size of Mediator/RNA droplets ( Figures 1 C–1E). Droplet sizes peaked at 100 nM RNA ( Figure 1 D), and the relative enrichment of RNA in the droplets, as measured by the ratio of average intensity inside versus outside the droplet (partition ratio), followed a similar trend ( Figure 1 E). Similar results were obtained using an enhancer RNA transcribed from the Pou5f1 super-enhancer ( Figures 1 F–1H). Thus, within the range of physiological levels observed in cells, low levels of RNA can enhance condensate formation, and high levels of RNA can reduce condensate formation by Mediator in vitro .
We next sought to determine whether the reentrant phase behavior of mixtures of RNA and transcriptional proteins is predominantly regulated by charge balance considerations, with other types of RNA-protein interactions playing a less significant role. We performed in vitro droplet assays ( Figure 2 A) using the MED1 C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (MED1-IDR), which has proven to be a useful surrogate for the multisubunit Mediator complex because it is not possible to purify sufficient amounts of this complex to test all parameters of interest ( Boija et al., 2018 12.

Fusion of GFP to MED1-IDR allows quantification by fluorescence of a single species whose effective charge can be calculated to determine the charge ratio between protein and RNA. Addition of increasing levels of RNA to a constant protein concentration should have predictable effects on partitioning of either component according to its charge ratio ( Figure 2 B). Noncoding and coding RNAs produced from three different super-enhancer loci and their associated genes ( Trim28 , Pou5f1 , and Nanog ; Figure S1 ) were selected for this analysis based on prior studies of nascent RNA sequencing data in mESCs ( Boija et al., 2018 12.

Addition of 6–400 nM of each of these RNAs to 1,000 nM MED1-IDR (protein:RNA ratios = 167:2.5) stimulated formation of MED1-IDR condensates at low RNA concentrations and dissolved MED1-IDR condensates at higher RNA concentrations ( Figures 2 C, 2D, S2 A, and S2B). BRD4 is another key component of transcriptional condensates, and BRD4-IDR protein exhibits condensate behaviors very similar to those of MED1-IDR ( Sabari et al., 2018 96. Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall’Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ); the effects of increasing RNA levels on formation and dissolution of BRD4-IDR condensates were very similar to those observed for MED1-IDR ( Figures S2 C and S2D). RNA did not stimulate formation of droplets with GFP alone or OCT4-GFP, both of which have a net negative charge ( Figure S2 E). Condensates exhibited internal dynamic reorganization ( Figure S2 F) with apparent diffusion coefficients 3–5 ± 0.8 × 10 −2 μm 2 /s ( STAR Methods ), consistent with liquid-like behavior ( Nott et al., 2015 82.

Taylor, N.O. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ∙ Stone, H.A. ... Quantifying Dynamics in Phase-Separated Condensates Using Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching Biophys. J. 2019; 117 :1285-1300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results show that diverse RNAs are capable of stimulating MED1-IDR condensate formation when present at relatively low levels and dissolving MED1-IDR condensates at high levels.
We sought to further test whether charge balance is the predominant phenomenon underlying the RNA-mediated effects on MED1-IDR condensates ( STAR Methods ). If so, then MED1-IDR/RNA condensate formation should be enhanced when the protein and RNA polymers are balanced in charge, and they should be sensitive to disruption of this balance. We quantified the relative charge of RNA and MED1-IDR and computed the correlation with the partition ratio of MED1-IDR ( STAR Methods ). RNA-mediated effects on MED1-IDR condensates correlated with their charge balance, as observed by the concordance of higher partition ratios near charge balance and lower partition ratios away from this balance ( Figure 2 D). We would expect an RNA length-dependent shift in the RNA level required for peak MED1-IDR partitioning when RNAs of different length are introduced into the droplet assay in equal numbers. This expectation, that a higher concentration of shorter RNAs is needed to disrupt condensate formation, was observed ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Another prediction from charge balance considerations is that these interactions should be largely independent of RNA sequence, so antisense versions of any one of the RNA species should exhibit the same quantitative effects as the sense strand, and this was also observed ( Figures S3 B and S3C). Consistent with charge balance considerations, MED1-IDR condensates formed with RNA were sensitive to increasing monovalent salt, which screens charged interactions ( Figure S3 D). The expectations from charge balance considerations also held when MED1-IDR and RNA concentrations were varied ( Figures S4 A–S4D) and when alternative polyanions (heparin and single-stranded DNA [ssDNA]) were employed ( Figures S4 E and S4F). RNA did not stimulate condensate formation by a MED1-IDR mutant lacking positively charged residues (MED1-IDR R/H/K > A) ( Figures S4 G and S4H). Although the experiments described above show a strong correlation between charge balance and partition ratios, the lack of complete correlation suggests that other features of RNA and MED1-IDR, such as RNA secondary structure ( Roden and Gladfelter, 2020 93. Roden, C. ∙ Gladfelter, A.S. RNA contributions to the form and function of biomolecular condensates Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; Published online July 6, 2020 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ) or non-electrostatic interactions ( Sabari et al., 2018 96. Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall’Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), may influence the observed phase behavior. Nonetheless, these results further support the concept that RNA-mediated effects on equilibrium behavior of MED1-IDR condensates are predominantly regulated by electrostatic effects.
We sought to investigate the functional consequence of the RNA-mediated reentrant phase behavior on transcription. RNA Pol II-dependent transcription can be reconstituted in vitro with purified components ( Roeder, 2019 95. Roeder, R.G. 50+ years of eukaryotic transcription: an expanding universe of factors and mechanisms Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :783-791 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), so we investigated whether droplets containing transcriptional components are formed in these assays and whether conditions that alter droplet levels similarly alter transcriptional output. We used a classic reconstituted mammalian transcription system with purified components, including RNA Pol II, general transcription factors, Mediator, and a transcriptional activator (Gal4), where addition of nucleotides permits transcription of a linear DNA template ( Figure 3 A). We observed that component mixtures and buffer conditions that are optimal for transcriptional output ( Carey et al., 2009 16. Carey, M.F. ∙ Peterson, C.L. ∙ Smale, S.T.

FACT, a factor that facilitates transcript elongation through nucleosomes Cell. 1998; 92 :105-116 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ) produced droplets containing the DNA template ( Figure 3 B). Quantification of the newly synthesized RNA in this system showed that 3.5 (±0.5) pM RNA was produced in the transcription reaction ( STAR Methods ). We were unable to demonstrate that RNA synthesis actually occurs in the droplets because we cannot eliminate the possibility that synthesis occurs in the bulk phase and the product subsequently partitions into the droplet, but the observation that protein and template DNA concentrate in droplets under conditions optimal for transcription ( Figure 3 B) and evidence that diverse condensate-altering treatments have similar effects on transcription, described below, are consistent with the notion that transcription occurs within condensates in this reconstituted system.
We reasoned that if transcription and droplet formation are mutually dependent in the reconstituted system, then treatments that alter transcription should similarly affect condensate formation and vice versa. Addition to the reaction of various chemicals that are known to inhibit transcription (elevated concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), NaCl, or heparin; Carey et al., 2009 16. Carey, M.F. ∙ Peterson, C.L. ∙ Smale, S.T.

Factors involved in specific transcription by mammalian RNA polymerase II. Transcription factor IIS stimulates elongation of RNA chains J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262 :3331-3337 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) caused reductions in droplet area, DNA partitioning, and transcription ( Figure S5 ). Spermine, a positively charged polyamine, enhances droplet formation when it contributes to charge balance in coacervate models ( Aumiller et al., 2016 5. Aumiller, Jr., W.M. ∙ Pir Cakmak, F. ∙ Davis, B.W. ... RNA-Based Coacervates as a Model for Membraneless Organelles: Formation, Properties, and Interfacial Liposome Assembly Langmuir. 2016; 32 :10042-10053 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Addition of spermine at concentrations predicted to balance charge in the in vitro reactions simultaneously increased droplet area, partitioning of template DNA, and levels of RNA synthesis ( Figures 3 C–3F; Table S2 ; Blair, 1985 10. Blair, D.G.R. Activation of mammalian RNA polymerases by polyamines Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17 :23-30 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moruzzi et al., 1975 77. Moruzzi, G. ∙ Barbiroli, B. ∙ Moruzzi, M.S. ... The effect of spermine on transcription of mammalian chromatin by mammalian deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase Biochem. J. 1975; 146 :697-703 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). These correlations suggest that optimal droplet formation and transcription are co-dependent.
An expectation of the RNA feedback model is that droplets in the reconstituted system might ultimately produce enough RNA to cause a reduction in droplet size and transcriptional output. However, the low concentrations of RNA produced in these systems (3.5 ± 0.5 pM; STAR Methods ) are insufficient to dissolve the droplets. For this reason, we tested whether purified RNA, added to the reaction, would similarly affect droplets and transcription. Indeed, addition of exogenous RNA reduced the number and size of the droplets ( Figures 3 G and 3H) and reduced template-derived RNA synthesis, as measured by qRT-PCR ( Figure 3 I). Although these results do not rule out additional ways in which RNA may affect transcription ( Pai et al., 2014 85. Pai, D.A. ∙ Kaplan, C.D. ∙ Kweon, H.K. ... RNAs nonspecifically inhibit RNA polymerase II by preventing binding to the DNA template RNA. 2014; 20 :644-655 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), they are consistent with the expected behavior of transcriptional condensates if RNA contributes to negative feedback control.
The in vitro experiments, which provide evidence that key transcriptional proteins and RNA exhibit electrostatics-driven, RNA-protein ratio-dependent reentrant phase transition, were performed under equilibrium conditions ( Figures 1 and 2 ). However, in vivo , RNA is synthesized and degraded at specific genomic loci by dynamic, ATP-dependent, non-equilibrium processes ( Azofeifa et al., 2018 6.

RNA exosome-regulated long non-coding RNA transcription controls super-enhancer activity Cell. 2015; 161 :774-789 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate how non-equilibrium processes underlying transcription may regulate transcriptional condensates, we built a physics-based model. The model consists of two inter-linked parts: (1) a free-energy function ( Figure 4 A) that depends on the concentrations of transcriptional proteins and RNA and recapitulates the equilibrium reentrant phase behavior of RNA-protein mixtures ( Figures 1 and 2 ), and (2) a mathematical framework to study spatiotemporal evolution of condensates subject to non-equilibrium dynamical processes of RNA synthesis, degradation, and diffusion ( Figure 4 B).
The goal of the model described below is to explore non-equilibrium regulation of transcription by RNA output and obtain insights into the pertinent mechanistic principles. Quantitative descriptions of RNA-protein phase behavior even in vitro ( Adhikari et al., 2018 2. Adhikari, S. ∙ Leaf, M.A. ∙ Muthukumar, M. Polyelectrolyte complex coacervation by electrostatic dipolar interactions J. Chem. Phys. 2018; 149 :163308 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Delaney and Fredrickson, 2017 28. Delaney, K.T. ∙ Fredrickson, G.H. Theory of polyelectrolyte complexation-Complex coacervates are self-coacervates J. Chem. Phys. 2017; 146 :224902 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) and direct measurements of the dynamic parameters underlying transcription are largely unavailable ( Rodriguez and Larson, 2020 94. Rodriguez, J. ∙ Larson, D.R. Transcription in Living Cells: Molecular Mechanisms of Bursting Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2020; 89 :189-212 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we sought to develop a phenomenological model of non-equilibrium regulation of transcription by RNA output and use it to predict the qualitative effects of perturbing model parameters. Our experimental approaches allow such perturbations to be realized and can test whether the predicted effects are accurate. By coupling the predictions of effects of perturbing model parameters with experimental tests, we aimed to obtain mechanistic insights into how RNA synthesis may dynamically regulate transcription itself.
We first developed a free-energy function to recapitulate the experimentally observed reentrant phase behavior of RNA-protein mixtures ( Figure 4 A). The free-energy function depends on the concentrations of transcriptional proteins and RNA ( 𝜑 𝑝 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) and ( 𝜑 𝑟 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) , which vary in space and time. For simplicity, all transcriptional proteins are combined into one pseudo-species. As noted above, our goal is not quantitative recapitulation of known experimental data but to obtain mechanistic insights into RNA-mediated non-equilibrium regulation of transcription that could be tested experimentally. Therefore, we first sought to develop a free-energy function that qualitatively recapitulates the observed reentrant phase behavior of RNA/protein mixtures. Following a long tradition in the physics of phase transitions, we employed a general Landau approach ( Kardar, 2007 52. Kardar, M. Statistical physics of fields Cambridge Univ. Press, 2007 Crossref Google Scholar ; Landau, 1937 59. Landau, L.D. ON THE THEORY OF PHASE TRANSITIONS Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 1937; 11 :19 Google Scholar ) and expanded the free energy as a function of RNA and protein concentrations. We include terms to describe repulsive RNA-RNA interactions, favorable interactions among the transcriptional proteins that drive condensate formation of transcriptional proteins in the absence of RNA ( Figure 4 C, equation 1, green) as well as a surface tension term important for describing condensate formation ( Figure 4 C, equation 1, blue; STAR Methods ). The free-energy function also includes protein-RNA interactions that are described by a concentration-dependent interaction term, which is expanded in the standard Landau fashion ( Figure 4 C, equation 1, red; Kardar, 2007 52. Kardar, M. Statistical physics of fields Cambridge Univ. Press, 2007 Crossref Google Scholar ). Magnitudes of the coefficients of the various terms in the expansion ( 𝜒 ,a,b,c) account for the effective strength of RNA-protein interactions ( STAR Methods ), which implicitly include solvent effects. Although symmetry arguments do not preclude any specific terms in this expansion, analysis of the pertinent Jacobian matrix shows that the choice of ( 𝜒 > 0 , 𝑐 > 0 , 𝑎 , 𝑏 ≪ 1 ) ensures a reentrant phase transition (schematic in Figures 4 B and S6 A; STAR Methods ) with a minimal number of higher-order terms. Results using the Landau model ( Figure 4 C, equation 1) are recapitulated using a different method for obtaining the free energy (Flory-Huggins) to highlight the generality of our Landau approach ( Figures S6 A and S6B; STAR Methods ). Given the universality of its application, easily characterizable phase behavior, and numerical ease of investigation (e.g., ∼50 times faster than the Flory-Huggins to study coupled dynamics), we employed the Landau free energy in the rest of this work to study how the dynamics of transcriptional condensates are regulated by transcription.
We next developed a mathematical framework to study the temporal evolution of transcriptional condensates as transcription ensues. Most transcriptional proteins turn over with a half-life of several hours ( Cambridge et al., 2011 15. Cambridge, S.B. ∙ Gnad, F. ∙ Nguyen, C. ... Systems-wide proteomic analysis in mammalian cells reveals conserved, functional protein turnover J. Proteome Res. 2011; 10 :5275-5284 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2016 19. Chen, W. ∙ Smeekens, J.M. ∙ Wu, R. Systematic study of the dynamics and half-lives of newly synthesized proteins in human cells Chem. Sci. (Camb.). 2016; 7 :1393-1400 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which is longer than timescales of transcription-associated events, which range from seconds to minutes ( Chen and Larson, 2016 18. Chen, H. ∙ Larson, D.R. What have single-molecule studies taught us about gene expression? Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :1796-1810 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fukaya et al., 2016 41.

Rodriguez, J. ∙ Larson, D.R. Transcription in Living Cells: Molecular Mechanisms of Bursting Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2020; 89 :189-212 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, the overall amount of protein is conserved in the timescales of interest. Thus, the dynamics of the protein concentration ( 𝜑 𝑝 ) are represented by standard model B dynamics ( Figure 4 C, equation 2; Hohenberg and Halperin, 1977 49. Hohenberg, P.C. ∙ Halperin, B.I. Theory of dynamic critical phenomena Rev. Mod. Phys. 1977; 49 :435-479 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Under model B dynamics, gradients in the protein chemical potential, which depend on the spatial distribution of protein and RNA concentrations, drive diffusive protein fluxes, which, in turn, drive the spatio-temporal evolution of 𝜑 𝑝 . Because RNA concentrations vary over transcription-associated timescales, the dynamics of 𝜑 𝑟 are explicitly governed by a reaction-diffusion equation. The key features (schematic in Figure 4 B) are that RNA diffuses with mobility 𝑀 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑎 and is synthesized and degraded with specific reaction rates: 𝑘 𝑝 and 𝑘 𝑑 , respectively. Because the RNA dynamics are far from equilibrium and the free-energy function noted above depends on protein and RNA concentrations, the coupled temporal evolution of transcriptional proteins and RNA ( Figure 4 C, equations 1 and 2) cannot be obtained from near-equilibrium considerations of simply going downhill in free energy with time. We employ this mathematical framework to study non-equilibrium regulation of transcriptional condensates.
We first sought to determine whether this model is consistent with previous studies ( Cho et al., 2016 21. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Jayanth, N. ∙ English, B.P. ... RNA Polymerase II cluster dynamics predict mRNA output in living cells eLife. 2016; 5 :e13617 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies have shown that transcriptional condensates at different genomic loci recruit a varying number of transcriptional proteins, which, in turn, correlates with condensate lifetimes. To explore this phenomenon, we numerically simulated equation 2 ( Figure 4 C) on 2D and 3D grids ( STAR Methods ). Locus-dependent recruitment of the transcriptional machinery can be mimicked in our model by varying the total transcriptional protein amount ( ⟨ 𝑃 0 ⟩ ) with all other parameters fixed because our simulation volume represents a local micro-environment ( Figure 4 A). Our simulations predict that loci that can recruit more transcriptional proteins (higher ⟨ 𝑃 0 ⟩ ) form relatively stable condensates, whereas condensates that recruit fewer proteins dissolve after a characteristic lifetime ( Figure 4 D). The model predictions for transcriptional condensate dynamics are qualitatively consistent with published data ( Cho et al., 2016 21. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Jayanth, N. ∙ English, B.P. ... RNA Polymerase II cluster dynamics predict mRNA output in living cells eLife. 2016; 5 :e13617 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ) and suggest that features encoded at genomic loci contribute to transcriptional condensate dynamics.
We next investigated how the sizes and lifetimes of transcriptional condensates change as a function of the effective rate of RNA synthesis ( 𝑘 𝑝 ) while keeping all other parameters fixed. In these simulations, the size of condensates initially increases and subsequently decreases with increasing effective rates of RNA synthesis ( Figure 4 E). Above a threshold rate of RNA synthesis, condensates dissolve ( Figure 4 E). The underlying reason for this result is the reentrant phase behavior of mixtures of transcriptional molecules and RNA ( Figures 1 and 2 ). We also find that condensates with higher transcriptional activity dissolve faster, as measured by condensate lifetimes ( Figure 4 F). Condensate lifetimes do not vary over a range of RNA transcription rates that reflect RNA-transcriptional protein ratios that roughly correspond to the charge balance conditions ( Figure 4 F). The same qualitative results are recapitulated in 3D simulations ( Figure S6 C) as well as simulations employing the Flory-Huggins free energy ( Figure S6 D) and further reinforced by partition ratios computed from simulations ( Figure S6 E). Further, we carried out simulations that accounted for phase-dependent changes in diffusion of RNA; i.e., RNA diffusion was hindered in the dense phase because of crowding ( Figure S6 F). Predictions of the condensate size and lifetimes exhibited qualitative trends similar to simulations without this phase-dependent diffusion ( Figure S6 F; Figures 4 E and 4F). Overall, our results suggest a model where low effective rates of RNA synthesis (or low transcription activity) stabilize transcriptional condensates, whereas higher rates promote condensate dissolution.
We then investigated the extent to which non-equilibrium effects underlying transcription regulate transcriptional condensate dynamics. RNA synthesis, degradation, and diffusion influence the spatial distribution of RNA, which, in turn, may feed back on transcriptional condensates. To explore this, we varied the diffusivity of RNA and the effective rates of RNA synthesis and degradation while holding the ratio of synthesis and degradation rates constant. The latter constraint ensures that the overall RNA concentration is constant in the condensate as other parameters are varied; thus, any effect on condensate dynamics arises from purely non-equilibrium effects. Varying the parameters that control RNA synthesis/degradation rates and diffusion changes the relative timescales of these processes ( 𝑡 𝑟 and 𝑡 𝑑 , respectively) ( STAR Methods ), which in turn, influences the spatial distribution of RNA in the condensate. If diffusion is slower than synthesis/degradation ( 𝑡 𝑟 < 𝑡 𝑑 ), then RNA will accumulate near transcription sites, leading to a higher local RNA concentration in the condensate. Conversely, if diffusion is faster than synthesis/degradation ( 𝑡 𝑟 > 𝑡 𝑑 ), then RNA will diffuse away from transcription sites, leading to a lower uniform RNA concentration in the condensate. The spatial distribution of RNA will affect condensates according to local charge balance. To study how varying spatial distributions of RNA affect transcriptional condensates, we simulated conditions where the overall RNA concentration was fixed close to the charge balance condition, promoting condensate formation at equilibrium. In these simulations, condensates that are stable when synthesis/degradation is slower than diffusion ( 𝑡 𝑟 > 𝑡 𝑑 ) dissolve when RNA synthesis/degradation is faster than diffusion ( 𝑡 𝑟 < 𝑡 𝑑 ) ( Figure 4 G). When ( 𝑡 𝑟 > 𝑡 𝑑 ) , RNA concentration is relatively uniform and low throughout the condensate, equilibrium effects dominate. Conversely, when ( 𝑡 𝑟 < 𝑡 𝑑 ) , RNA is distributed non-uniformly with high local concentrations in the condensate, non-equilibrium effects dominate to result in condensate dissolution ( Figure 4 G). In the latter case, the localized high RNA concentrations exceed the charge balance condition because of non-equilibrium effects. Approximate estimates for the rates of RNA synthesis, degradation, and diffusion under physiological conditions ( 𝑡 𝑑 𝑡 𝑟 ≈ 2 − 1 0 0 , STAR Methods ) suggest that transcriptional condensate dynamics are likely driven off equilibrium.
We sought to synthesize our results so far to explore the effect of non-equilibrium dynamics on regulating transcriptional condensates across transcription initiation and productive elongation. Simulations were started at a relatively low effective rate of RNA synthesis, mimicking initiation, followed by an increase to a relatively high effective rate of RNA synthesis, mimicking productive elongation. The simulations predict that low effective rates of RNA synthesis enhance condensate formation, and these condensates subsequently dissolve upon ensuing higher effective rates of RNA synthesis ( Figure 4 H). Consistent with these simulations, Mediator condensates tend to be depleted in areas of high, RNA Pol II-driven nascent transcription ( Figure S7 A–S7C). These results suggest that non-equilibrium processes underlying RNA synthesis can potentially regulate formation and dissolution of transcriptional condensates.
Transcriptional condensates in cells are highly dynamic, forming and dissolving at timescales ranging from seconds to minutes ( Cho et al., 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously showed that condensate formation is associated with transcription activation and initiation ( Cho et al., 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ). When transcriptional condensates are formed, the RNA-mediated condensate dissolution model predicts that inhibition of elongation should increase the size and lifetime of transcriptional condensates ( Figure 5 A). We used the physics-based model ( Figure 4 ) to simulate the effects of elongation inhibition on transcriptional condensates and performed experiments to test the predictions from these simulations in cells ( Figures 5 B–5I). To account for the locus-dependent ability to recruit the transcriptional machinery and RNA Pol II, we performed these simulations at a range of total protein concentrations (as in Figures 4 D and 4E) but for conditions where the effective rate of RNA synthesis (k p ) was high (corresponding to elongation) and low (corresponding to inhibited elongation). The results of the simulations predict that a reduced effective rate of RNA synthesis should increase the size and lifetime of transcriptional condensates across a range of total protein concentrations ( Figure 5 B and 5F).
To experimentally test these predictions from the simulations, mESCs engineered with an endogenous, GFP-tagged subunit of Mediator (Med1-GFP) ( Sabari et al., 2018 96. Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall’Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) were treated for 30 min with Actinomycin-D (ActD) or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) ( Figure 5 C), which disrupt transcription elongation through DNA intercalation and inhibition of CDK9-mediated RNA Pol II pause release, respectively ( Singh and Padgett, 2009 107. Singh, J. ∙ Padgett, R.A. Rates of in situ transcription and splicing in large human genes Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 :1128-1133 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sobell, 1985 109. Sobell, H.M. Actinomycin and DNA transcription Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82 :5328-5331 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Steurer et al., 2018 111. Steurer, B. ∙ Janssens, R.C. ∙ Geverts, B. ... Live-cell analysis of endogenous GFP-RPB1 uncovers rapid turnover of initiating and promoter-paused RNA Polymerase II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E4368-E4376 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the model predictions, after inhibition of elongation, Med1-GFP condensates increased in volume by ∼2-fold as measured by 3D super-resolution microscopy ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Condensate lifetime could not be assessed in these cells because of the long duration of image acquisition and consequent photobleaching, so we turned to time-correlated photo-activation localization microscopy (tcPALM) super-resolution microscopy in mESCs with an endogenous Med19-Halo tag ( Cho et al., 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cisse et al., 2013 24. Cisse, I.I. ∙ Izeddin, I. ∙ Causse, S.Z. ... Real-time dynamics of RNA polymerase II clustering in live human cells Science. 2013; 341 :664-667 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ) to investigate the effects of elongation inhibition on condensate lifetime ( Figure 5 G). Cells were treated for 30 min with DRB to disrupt transcription elongation, and the lifetime of Med19 condensates was quantified. When transcription elongation was inhibited by DRB treatment, Med19 condensates exhibited significantly longer lifetimes than mock-treated cells ( Figures 5 H and 5I), and when DRB-treated cells were washed with fresh medium, the lifetimes of the Med19 condensates recovered to those of the mock-treated condition ( Figures 5 H and 5I). The in silico and experimental results show that suppression of elongation in cells leads to increased condensate size and lifetime, consistent with a model where a burst of RNA synthesis can promote dissolution of transcriptional condensates in cells.
The RNA-mediated feedback model suggests that modifying the concentration or size of RNA molecules should have a predictable effect on transcriptional output. We developed complementary experimental and simulation approaches ( Figure 6 ) where the levels of putative “feedback RNAs” could be increased artificially. We first used the physics-based model ( Figure 4 ) to simulate the effect of increasing effective rates of RNA synthesis as well as varying lengths for the synthesized RNA on condensates ( STAR Methods ). The simulations predicted that increases in the production rate of shorter RNAs initially enhance and subsequently suppress transcriptional condensate size, whereas increases in the production rate of longer RNAs lead to reduced condensate size with increasing synthesis rates ( Figure 6 E).
To test this prediction, we investigated the effect of artificially increasing the levels of feedback RNAs on transcription of an adjacent luciferase reporter gene in cells ( Figures 6 A and 6B; Kirk et al., 2018 55. Kirk, J.M. ∙ Kim, S.O. ∙ Inoue, K. ... Functional classification of long non-coding RNAs by k-mer content Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :1474-1482 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA molecules specifying RNAs of a range of sizes were cloned into this system to allow doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression of these RNAs, and mESC lines were generated with clones of integrated constructs. Feedback RNAs were observed at loci of Mediator puncta under low-Dox stimulation, suggesting that these actively transcribed genes are associated with transcriptional condensates ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Elevated expression of feedback RNAs under higher-Dox stimulation reduced their colocalization with Mediator puncta, consistent with the model of RNA-mediated feedback on condensates ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S7 D). To study the effect of local RNA levels on transcription, additional cell lines harboring diverse feedback RNAs were then treated with increasing doses of Dox to induce feedback RNA expression ( Figure 6 F), and reporter expression was measured by luminescence ( Figure 6 G). The results were consistent with model predictions ( Figure 6 E); increases in the levels of short feedback RNAs initially enhanced reporter expression and then suppressed this, whereas progressive increases in the levels of the longer feedback RNAs reduced reporter expression more strongly ( Figure 6 G). We confirmed that changes in reporter expression arise from cis RNA-mediated effects by modifying the constructs, controlling for the global effects of Dox, and perturbing local RNA concentration ( Figures S7 E–S7K). These results support a role for RNA-mediated feedback in the control of transcriptional condensates.

Section: Discussion

The results described here indicate that transcription is a non-equilibrium process that provides dynamic feedback through its RNA product. The results support a model where RNA provides positive and negative feedback on transcription via regulation of electrostatic interactions in transcriptional condensates. Transcriptional condensates, whose formation involves crowding of transcription factors by enhancer DNA ( Shrinivas et al., 2019 104. Shrinivas, K. ∙ Sabari, B.R. ∙ Coffey, E.L. ... Enhancer Features that Drive Formation of Transcriptional Condensates Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :549-561.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ) and electrostatic and other interactions between the IDRs of transcription factors and coactivators ( Boija et al., 2018 12. Boija, A. ∙ Klein, I.A. ∙ Sabari, B.R. ...

Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall’Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), engage RNA to both promote and dissolve the condensates. In this RNA feedback model, low levels of short RNAs produced during transcription initiation promote formation of transcriptional condensates, whereas high levels of the longer RNAs produced during elongation can cause condensate dissolution ( Figure 7 ).
An RNA-mediated feedback model for transcriptional regulation provides a potential explanation for the roles of enhancer and promoter-associated RNAs, which are evolutionarily conserved features of eukaryotes. These low-abundance short RNAs, transcribed bidirectionally from enhancers and promoters, have been reported to affect transcription from their associated genes through diverse postulated mechanisms. The diversity of sequences present in these short RNA species has made it difficult to postulate a common molecular mechanism for their effects on transcription. In this context, a model for RNA-mediated feedback regulation of condensates is attractive for several reasons. RNA molecules are known components of other biomolecular condensates, including the nucleolus, nuclear speckles, paraspeckles, and stress granules, where they are known to play regulatory roles ( Fay and Anderson, 2018 37. Fay, M.M. ∙ Anderson, P.J. The role of RNA in biological phase separations J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4685-4701 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roden and Gladfelter, 2020 93. Roden, C. ∙ Gladfelter, A.S. RNA contributions to the form and function of biomolecular condensates Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; Published online July 6, 2020 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). RNA is a powerful regulator of condensates that are formed by electrostatic forces because it has a high negative charge density due to its phosphate backbone ( Drobot et al., 2018 32. Drobot, B. ∙ Iglesias-Artola, J.M. ∙ Le Vay, K. ... Compartmentalised RNA catalysis in membrane-free coacervate protocells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3643 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Frankel et al., 2016 40. Frankel, E.A. ∙ Bevilacqua, P.C. ∙ Keating, C.D. Polyamine/Nucleotide Coacervates Provide Strong Compartmentalization of Mg 2+ , Nucleotides, and RNA Langmuir. 2016; 32 :2041-2049 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), explaining why the effects of diverse RNAs on transcriptional condensates are sequence independent. The functions of most noncoding RNAs remain a mystery, and this model suggests a mechanism by which some of these might participate in tuning local gene expression.
Recent studies indicate that transcription occurs in periodic bursts (∼1–10 min in duration), where multiple molecules of RNA Pol II can be released from promoters within a short time frame and produce multiple molecules of mRNA (∼1–100 molecules per burst). Multiple models explain such periodic bursts through stochastic gene activation events ( Chen and Larson, 2016 18. Chen, H. ∙ Larson, D.R.

Trends Genet. 2020; 36 :288-297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) but are often agnostic to the underlying mechanism or attribute these to rate-limiting transcription factor binding events. We suggest that a rapid and spatially localized change in charge balance, due to increased RNA synthesis at pause release of active RNA Pol II, may contribute to dissolution of transcriptional condensates and thus dynamic loss of the pool of transcriptional apparatus in those condensates. This would provide negative feedback to arrest transcription and a mechanism to account for the dynamic bursty behavior observed for transcription.

ES cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator on 0.2% gelatinized (Sigma, G1890) tissue-culture plates in 2i medium with LIF, which was made according to the following recipe: 960 mL DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, 11320082), 5 mL N2 supplement (Life Technologies, 17502048; stock 100X), 10 mL B27 supplement (Life Technologies, 17504044; stock 50X), 5 mL additional L-glutamine (GIBCO 25030-081; stock 200 mM), 10 mL MEM nonessential amino acids (GIBCO 11140076; stock 100X), 10 mL penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, 15140163; stock 10ˆ4 U/mL), 333 μL BSA fraction V (GIBCO 15260037; stock 7.50%), 7 μL β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma M6250; stock 14.3 M), 100 μL LIF (Chemico, ESG1107; stock 10ˆ7 U/mL), 100 μL PD0325901 (Stemgent, 04-0006-10; stock 10 mM), and 300 μL CHIR99021 (Stemgent, 04-0004-10; stock 10 mM). For confocal and PALM imaging, cells were grown on glass coverslips (Carolina Biological Supply, 633029) that had been coated with the following: 5 μg/mL of poly-L-ornithine (Sigma P4957) at 37°C for at least 30 minutes followed by 5 μg/mL of laminin (Corning, 354232) at 37°C for at least 2 hours. Cells were passaged by washing once with 1X PBS (Life Technologies, AM9625) and incubating with TrypLE (Life Technologies, 12604021) for 3-5 minutes, then quenched with serum-containing media made by the following recipe: 500 mL DMEM KO (GIBCO 10829-018), MEM nonessential amino acids (GIBCO 11140076; stock 100X), penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, 15140163; stock 10ˆ4 U/mL), 5 mL L-glutamine (GIBCO 25030-081; stock 100X), 4 μL β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma M6250; stock 14.3 M), 50 μL LIF (Chemico, ESG1107; stock 10ˆ7 U/mL), and 75 mL of fetal bovine serum (Sigma, F4135). Cells were passaged every 2 days.
As described in Sabari et al., 2018, ChIP-seq browser tracks for MED1, Pol II, BRD4, and OCT4 were generated by aligning reads to NCBI37/mm9 using Bowtie with the following settings: “-p 4–best -k 1 -m 1–sam -l 40.” WIG files represent counts (in reads per million, floored at 0.1) of aligned reads within 50 bp bins. Each read was extended by 200nt in the direction of the alignment.

For generation of the GRO-seq browser tracks, GRO-seq reads were processed as described in Sigova et al. (2015) 105. Sigova, A.A. ∙ Abraham, B.J. ∙ Ji, X. ... Transcription factor trapping by RNA in gene regulatory elements Science. 2015; 350 :978-981 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar . The GRO-seq .sra file corresponding to GEO accession number GEO: GSM1665566 ( Sigova et al., 2015 105. Sigova, A.A. ∙ Abraham, B.J. ∙ Ji, X. ...

Reads were aligned to the mouse genome (NCBI37/mm9) using Bowtie v1.2.2 ( Langmead et al., 2009 61. Langmead, B. ∙ Trapnell, C. ∙ Pop, M. ... Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome Genome Biol. 2009; 10 :R25 Crossref Scopus (14576) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following settings “-e 70 -k 1 -m 10 -n 2–best.” The reads corresponding to each one of the features (super-enhancers, typical enhancers, proximal promoter regions, genes) were counted using featureCounts v1.6.2 ( Liao et al., 2014 69. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (7875) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default settings. The coordinates for typical enhancers and super-enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were acquired from Whyte et al. (2013) 119. Whyte, W.A. ∙ Orlando, D.A. ∙ Hnisz, D. ...

The coordinates for genes (transcription start and end sites) were acquired using the UCSC Table Browser ( Karolchik et al., 2004 53. Karolchik, D. ∙ Hinrichs, A.S. ∙ Furey, T.S. ... The UCSC Table Browser data retrieval tool Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :D493-D496 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The upstream antisense promoter regions were defined as genomic areas containing 1 kb upstream of each TSS. Their coordinates were retrieved by using BEDTools v.2.26.0 ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 88. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M.

Reads were normalized with the size of the corresponding feature they aligned to.

Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :276-278 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default settings and NCBI37/mm9 as reference genome. Nextflow v20.01.0 was used as a workflow tool on an LSF High-Performance Computing environment ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017 29. Di Tommaso, P. ∙ Chatzou, M. ∙ Floden, E.W. ... Nextflow enables reproducible computational workflows Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :316-319 Crossref Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ). STAR v2.6.1d ( Dobin et al., 2013 31. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (17374) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for the alignment of reads. Aligned reads were assigned to the aforementioned intervals (typical enhancers, super-enhancers, proximal promoter regions and genes) by using featureCounts v1.6.4, with the default settings.
Known concentrations of in vitro transcribed enhancer RNAs and pre-mRNAs from Trim28 and Pou5f1 loci are used as standards to approximate the number of molecules in cells. These RNAs are converted to cDNAs by reverse-transcription and mixed at equal concentrations. For each RNA species, a standard curve of qRT-PCR Ct value to RNA amount was generated using serial dilutions, with two different primer sets in technical duplicates. Next, qRT-PCR reactions using the same primer sets were performed for biological duplicates of mESCs. Actb-normalized Ct values were then used to determine the amount of RNA species in the reaction based on the standard curves above. To calculate the number of RNA molecules per cell, the amount of RNA (g) was divided by the molar weight of each species (∼350 (g mol –1 nt –1 ) × length of in vitro transcribed RNA (nt)), multiplied by Avogadro’s number (6.022 × 10 23 mol –1 ), and divided by the approximate number of cells used in each reaction (10,000 cells). Melting curves were analyzed to confirm primers specificity. Non-reverse-transcribed (–RT) controls were included to rule out the amplification of genomic DNA. Primer sequences are indicated in Table S1 .
Recombinant GFP fusion proteins were concentrated to a desired protein concentration using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (30K MWCO, Millipore). Droplet reactions with the recombinant proteins were performed in 10 ul volumes in PCR tubes under the following buffer condition: 30 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2% Glycerol and 1 mM DTT. The same buffer containing 55 mM NaCl was used for BRD4-IDR-GFP. Droplet reactions with the Mediator complex were performed under the following buffer condition: 30 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 65 mM NaCl, 2% Glycerol and 1 mM DTT. For all droplet reactions, protein and buffer were mixed first and RNA or ssDNA or heparin (Sigma, H3393) was added later. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr without any shaking or rotating. The reactions were then individually transferred into 384 well-plate (Cellvis P384-1.5H-N) by using a micropipette (2-20 μL) 5 minutes prior to imaging by confocal microscopy at 150X magnification or prior to turbidity measurements on a plate reader (Tecan) at 350 nm absorbance at room temperature ( Banerjee et al., 2017 8. Banerjee, P.R. ∙ Milin, A.N. ∙ Moosa, M.M. ... Reentrant Phase Transition Drives Dynamic Substructure Formation in Ribonucleoprotein Droplets Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2017; 56 :11354-11359 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). The concentration of proteins and RNAs in the droplet reactions are indicated in the figure legends. For brightfield Mediator experiments ( Figure 1 ), representative images were subtracted by a median filtered image (px = 15) using ImageJ to remove camera artifacts discovered by taking images of blank wells.
FRAP was performed on an Andor Revolution Spinning Disk Confocal microscope with 488-nm laser. Droplets were bleached using 30% laser power with 20 μs dwell time for 5 pulses, and images were collected every second for 60 s. Fluorescence intensity at the bleached spot and a control unbleached spot was measured using ImageJ. Values are normalized to the unbleached spot to control for photobleaching during image acquisition and then normalized to the first time point intensity.
MATLAB scripts were written to process the intensity data, and post bleach FRAP recovery data was normalized to pre-bleach intensity (FRAP(t)) and fit to: F R A P ⁡ ( t ) = M ( 1 − e x p ⁡ ( − t / τ ) ) Where, M (mobile fraction) and τ (half-life of recovery) are inferred from fitting the data using in-built MATLAB functions. These values are inferred for each replicate and averaged to provide a range for the apparent diffusion coefficients, which is computed as: D a p p = ( B l e a c h r a d i u s ) 2 / τ
To analyze in vitro droplet experiments, we used a previously reported pipeline ( Guo et al., 2019 45. Guo, Y.E. ∙ Manteiga, J.C. ∙ Henninger, J.E. ... Pol II phosphorylation regulates a switch between transcriptional and splicing condensates Nature. 2019; 572 :543-548 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). The code for this analysis is available at the Github link in the Data/Code Availability section. All droplets were segmented from average images of captured channels on various criteria: (1) an intensity threshold that was three s.d. above the mean of the image; (2) size thresholds (20 pixel minimum droplet size); and (3) a minimum circularity (circularity = 4π⋅(area)/(perimeter 2 )) of 0.8 (1 being a perfect circle). After segmentation, mean intensity for each droplet was calculated while excluding pixels near the phase interface. Hundreds of droplets identified in (typically) ten independent fields of view were quantified. The mean intensity within the droplets (C-in) and in the bulk (C-out) were calculated for each channel. The partition ratio was computed as (C-in)/(C-out).
Droplet size, partition ratio, and condensed fraction measure distinct properties of droplet formation, and these three metrics show similar trends upon RNA-mediated reentrant phase transitions. When a protein or RNA is fluorescently-labeled in our experiments, we favor measuring the partition ratio. This is because the partition ratio can be measured on a per-droplet basis, and unlike condensed fraction, which varies depending on the number of droplets per field, the partition ratio is more independent of the field that is imaged.
For the size analysis of droplets formed in the reconstituted transcription assays ( Figure 3 ), brightfield images were subtracted by a median-filtered image (px = 21), and droplets were manually segmented and their areas measured using ImageJ.
Enhancer and promoter sequences for RNAs were obtained from super-enhancer-regulated genes Pou5f1 , Nanog , and Trim28 . For promoter sequences, the first 475-490bp from the first exon were selected from mm10. For enhancer sequences, GROseq reads ( Sigova et al., 2015 105. Sigova, A.A. ∙ Abraham, B.J. ∙ Ji, X. ... Transcription factor trapping by RNA in gene regulatory elements Science. 2015; 350 :978-981 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ) from both + and - strands aligned to mm9 were overlapped with called super-enhancers ( Whyte et al., 2013 119. Whyte, W.A. ∙ Orlando, D.A. ∙ Hnisz, D. ... Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes Cell. 2013; 153 :307-319 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2192) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contiguous regions of read density above background were manually selected ( Figure S1 ). Primers were designed to amplify the selected promoter and enhancer sequences from genomic DNA isolated from V6.5 mESCs ( Table S1 ). The following sequences were added to the forward and reverse primers to add the bacterial polymerase promoters: T7 (add to 5′ of sense or forward primer): 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ SP6 (add to 5′ of antisense or reverse primer): 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAA-3′
Phusion polymerase (NEB) is used to amplify the products with the bacterial promoters, and products are run on a 1% agarose gel, gel-purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN), and eluted in 40 μL H2O. Templates were sequenced to verify their identity. A volume of 8 μL of each template (10-40 ng/μL) was transcribed using the MEGAscript T7 (Invitrogen; sense) or MEGAscript SP6 (Invitrogen; antisense) kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For visualization of the RNA by microscopy, reactions included a Cy5-labeled UTP (Enzo LifeSciences ENZ-42506) at a ratio of 1:10 labeled UTP:unlabeled UTP. The in vitro transcription was incubated overnight at 37°C, then 1 μL TURBO DNase (supplied in kit) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C. The MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit (Invitrogen) was used to purify the RNA following the manufacturer’s instructions and eluting in 40 μL H2O. RNA was diluted to 2 μM and aliquoted to limit freeze/thaw cycles, and RNA was run on 1% agarose gels in TBE buffer to verify a single band of correct size.

Cheeseman Lab). Expression of proteins was induced by addition of 1mM IPTG either at 16°C for 18 hours or at 37°C for 5 hours. Extracts were prepared as previously described ( Boija et al., 2018 12.

Cell pellets were resuspended in 15 mL of denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 8M Urea) with protease inhibitors (Roche,11873580001). After complete resuspension, the lysates were sonicated for ten cycles (15 s on and 60 s off) and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was transferred into fresh tube and the lysates were incubated with 1 mL of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA agarose beads (Invitrogen, R901-15) with denaturing buffer at 4°C for 1.5 hours. After washing the beads with 15 volumes of the denaturing buffer, proteins were eluted with 50mM Tris pH 7.4, 500mM NaCl, 250mM imidazole buffer containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche,11873580001). Proteins were dialyzed against 50mM Tris pH 7.4, 125 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 1mM DTT at 4°C for BRD4-IDR-GFP, OCT4-GFP and GFP alone and the same buffer containing 500 mM NaCl for MED1-IDR-GFP.
HeLa nuclear protein extract (4g) was prepared as described in Dignam et al. (1983) 30. Dignam, J.D. ∙ Lebovitz, R.M. ∙ Roeder, R.G. Accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract from isolated mammalian nuclei Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11 :1475-1489 Crossref Scopus (9140) PubMed Google Scholar . Nuclear extract was dialyzed against BC100: BC buffer, pH 7.5 + 100mM KCl (20 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM β-Mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v) and 100 mM KCl). The extract was fractionated on a phosphocellulose column (P11) with BC buffer containing 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1M KCl. The Mediator complex eluted in the 0.5M KCL (BC500) fraction. This fraction was dialyzed against BC100 and loaded on a DEAE Cellulose column and sequentially fractionated with BC buffer containing 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5M KCl. The Mediator did not bind the DEAE Cellulose resin and was collected in the flow through fraction 0.1M KCl (BC100). This fraction was then directly loaded onto a DEAE-5PW column (TSK) and eluted with a linear KCl gradient from 0.1 to 1M KCl in BC buffer. The Mediator complex eluted between 0.4 and 0.6M KCl. The fractions containing Mediator were pooled and dialyzed against BD700: BD buffer, (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mM β-Mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 700 mM (NH4)2SO4). This fraction was then loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) column and eluted with a linear reverse gradient from 0.7 to 0.025M (NH4)2SO4 in BD buffer. The Mediator complex eluted between 0.3 and 0.1M (NH4)2SO4. The Mediator-containing fractions were again pooled and dialyzed against BA100: BA buffer, pH 7.5 + 100 mM NaCl (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM β-Mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 100 mM NaCl) and loaded onto a Heparin Agarose column. The column was washed with BA100 and step-eluted with BA buffer containing 0.25, 0.5, 1M and 1M NaCl. The Mediator complex eluted in the 0.5M NaCl (BA500) fraction. A portion of this fraction was then loaded on a Superose-6 (gel filtration column) that was equilibrated and run in BC100. The Mediator complex eluted from the gel filtration column with a mass range between 1-2MDa.
The reconstituted in vitro transcription by RNA polymerase II was performed as previously described ( Flores et al., 1992 38. Flores, O. ∙ Lu, H. ∙ Reinberg, D.

A 1000 bp template DNA (unlabeled or Cy-3 labeled at 3′ end) containing adenovirus major late promoter, five Gal4 binding sites, TATA-box sequence and 561 bp from eGFP sequence was used. First, pre-initiation complex was assembled at RT for 15 min by mixing the following components: 50 nM RNA polymerase II enriched for hypophosphorylated CTD, 50 nM general transcription factors (TFIIA-B-D-E-F-H), and 5.75 nM template DNA, in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 65 mM NaCl, 6.25 mM MgCl2, and 6.25 mM Sodium butyrate. Next, 10 nM Mediator complex and 10 nM GAL4 (Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to activation domain of VP16) were added to the reaction. Last, nucleotide mix containing 0.375 mM ATP, CTP, UTP, GTP (Invitrogen), 0.01 U RNase Inhibitor (Invitrogen), 1.25% PEG-8000 were added together with one of the following: a) various amounts of purified exogenous Pou5f1 RNA (0-500 nM) b) spermine (Sigma, S4264) c) extra NTPs (Invitrogen) d) extra NaCl e) heparin (Sigma, H3393). The reaction was incubated at 30°C for 2 hr. RNA isolation was performed using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) by including a spike-in RNA control and an RNA carrier. Purified RNAs were treated with ezDNase (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C to eliminate the template DNA. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript IV (Invitrogen) and qPCR was performed with SYBR Green Real Time PCR master mix (Invitrogen) to quantify the template derived transcriptional output. The Ct values of the reactions were normalized to the spike-in RNA control. The concentration of template derived transcriptional output was calculated by using a standard curve of qRT-PCR Ct values generated by known amounts of serially diluted GFP RNA. The sequence of primers used for qRT-PCR are indicated in Table S1 .
To visualize the droplets formed in the reconstituted transcription assay, using a micropipette (2-20 μL), 5 μL of the reactions were loaded onto a homemade chamber, which was prepared by attaching coverslips to a glass slide by parallel strips of double-sided tape ( Sabari et al., 2018 96. Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall’Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). After the droplets were settled on the glass coverslip, the images were collected by using RPI Spinning Disk confocal microscope with a 100x objective. To account for camera artifacts in the images, brightfield Images of droplets from reconstituted assays were subjected to a white tophat filter with a disk element radius of 21 using the MorphoLib plugin in ImageJ, then a Gaussian filter (sigma = 1) was applied.
Our goal in this section is to develop a simplified and coarse-grained model that captures the qualitative physics of RNA-protein mixtures. Based on phenomenological observations of transcriptional proteins and RNA ( Figure 2 ), such a model must recapitulate the following key features: • Transcriptional proteins phase separate in the absence of RNA through other types of interactions, albeit at higher concentrations. • At fixed protein concentrations, addition of RNA initially promotes de-mixing and at higher levels drive a re-entry into the mixed phase.
Motivated by the evidence that transcriptional condensates recruit diverse coactivators, transcription factors, and other proteins of the transcriptional apparatus ( Boija et al., 2018 12.

Similarly, while different species of RNA are likely present within these condensates, we define an effective RNA species (R).
First, we approach this problem by constructing a phenomenological free-energy with 2 order-parameters that represent scaled concentrations of protein ( 𝜑 𝑝 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) and RNA ( 𝜑 𝑟 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) . We define the free-energy (normalized to 𝑘 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑇 = 1 ) as: 𝑓 ⁡ [ 𝜑 𝑝 , 𝜑 𝑟 ] = ∫ 𝑉 𝑑 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑉 ⁢ ( 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁡ ( 𝜑 𝑝 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) + 𝜌 𝑟 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑟 + 𝜒 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁡ 𝑓 ⁡ ( 𝜑 𝑝 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) , 𝜑 𝑟 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) + 𝜅 2 ⁢ ( ∇ 𝜑 𝑝 ) 2 ) Here, 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁡ ( 𝜑 𝑝 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) = 𝜌 𝑠 ⁢ ( 𝜑 𝑝 − 𝛼 ) 2 ⁢ ( 𝜑 𝑝 − 𝛽 ) 2 is a standard double-well potential that ensures protein components phase separate without RNA with co-existence concentrations specified by 𝛼 , 𝛽 . Choice of 𝜅 > 0 ensures that there is finite surface tension for the protein condensate. The second-order term for RNA ( 𝜌 𝑟 > 0 ) states that within this model-framework, RNA cannot phase-separate in the absence of protein. Given that electrostatic interactions at physiological salt conditions are fairly short-ranged (Debye length ∼1nm), we capture the non-linear nature of RNA-protein interactions in an effective interaction term 𝜒 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 . We define this interaction term in the spirit of the Landau-Ginzburg approach as an expansion in powers of the order parameters: 𝜒 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁡ ( 𝜑 𝑝 , 𝜑 𝑟 ) = − 𝜒 ⁡ 𝜑 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑟 + 𝑎 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑟 + 𝑏 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑟 + 𝑐 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑟 + … + 𝐻 . 𝑂 . 𝑇 While symmetry arguments often dictate or exclude certain types of terms (odd powers in Ising models for example) in such an expansion, there are no obvious symmetry constraints for this system. Hence, our modeling approach is to minimize the number of higher-order terms that need to be included to recapitulate the experimentally observed reentrant phase transition. Our experimental results suggest that low concentrations of RNA promote phase separation, and thus the lowest order term ( − 𝜒 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑟 , 𝜒 > 0 ) lowers the free-energy. However, higher-order terms must counter this and below we outline how we determine which terms to include. In general, the stability of a mixture described by such a free-energy can be ascertained from the Jacobian matrix 𝐽 . For our model, the elements of this 2 × 2 matrix are: 𝐽 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 = ∂ 2 𝑓 ∂ 𝜑 2 𝑝 = 2 ⁢ 𝜌 𝑠 ⁢ ( 6 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑝 − 6 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 ⁢ ( 𝛽 + 𝛼 ) + ( 𝛼 − 𝛽 ) 2 ) + 2 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑟 + 2 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑟 ⁢ 𝐽 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 = ∂ 2 𝑓 ∂ 𝜑 𝑝 ∂ 𝜑 𝑟 = − 𝜒 + 2 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑟 + 2 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 + 4 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑟 𝐽 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑟 = ∂ 2 𝑓 ∂ 𝜑 2 𝑟 = 2 ⁢ 𝜌 𝑟 + 2 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 + 2 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑝 The mixed phase is no longer stable to perturbations when at least one eigen value of 𝐽 becomes negative (spinodal instability). In the absence of RNA, the spinodal satisfies 𝐽 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 = 0 . If only the pairwise interaction terms were considered ( − 𝜒 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑟 ) , the spinodal region broadens i.e., phase separation is promoted at lower protein concentrations when RNA is present. We next characterized the effect of an additional higher-order term (only one of 𝑎 , 𝑏 or 𝑐 is non-zero) on the Jacobian matrix. We ascertained that: • 𝑎 > 0 : While the free-energy is dominated by repulsive interactions at higher RNA concentrations, the Jacobian matrix predicts a continuous underlying instability. Instead of suppressing phase separation at higher RNA concentrations and promoting re-entry to dilute phase, this term would instead change the composition of the demixed phases. • 𝑏 > 0 : While this term promotes a reentrant behavior, the resulting regions of instability demix RNA away from protein for most values of b. • 𝑐 > 0 : For values of 𝑐 that are not too large (i.e., 𝑐 < ≈ 𝜌 𝑟 ), the resulting phase diagram mirrors a reentrant shape with RNA enrichment in the protein condensate. If 𝑐 is larger, then a second de-mixing transition (similar to case 2 i.e., b > 0) is observed at high values of 𝜑 𝑝 , 𝜑 𝑟 . Since we are interested in the limit of relatively low protein/RNA concentrations, and the values of 𝜑 𝑝 , 𝜑 𝑟 represent qualitative proxies of protein/RNA concentrations, we choose to explore our model in this parameter regime.
While cubic and higher-order terms are required to recapitulate complete phase-behavior, we explored our model with 𝑐 > 0 , assuming the coefficients 𝑎 , 𝑏 are small. In the simulations reported in Figures 4 , 5 , and 6 , the free-energy parameters are 𝛼 = 0 . 1 , 𝛽 = 0 . 7 , 𝜒 = 1 . 0 , 𝑐 = 1 0 . 0 , 𝜅 = 0 . 5 , 𝜌 𝑠 = 1 . 0 , 𝜌 𝑟 = 1 0 . 0 , 𝑎 = 𝑏 = 0 . All free-energy calculations were performed with Python and code is available at:
https://github.com/krishna-shrinivas/2020_Henninger_Oksuz_Shrinivas_RNA_feedback .
In this approach, rather than employ a phenomenological model, we parametrize a microscopic model motivated by Flory-Huggins polymer-solution theory ( Flory, 1942 39. Flory, P.J. Thermodynamics of High Polymer Solutions J. Chem. Phys. 1942; 10 :51-61 Crossref Google Scholar ). The simplified F-H model contains 3 components - protein, RNA, and the solvent (s), whose volume fractions are defined as 𝜑 𝑝 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) , 𝜑 𝑟 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) , 1 − 𝜑 𝑝 ⁡ ( ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) − 𝜑 𝑟 ⁡ ( → 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) respectively. The free-energy (normalized as before) is defined as: 𝑓 = ∑ 𝑖 𝜑 𝑖 𝑟 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝜑 𝑖 ) + ∑ 𝑖 , 𝑗 > 𝑖 𝜒 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑖 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑗
Here, 𝑟 𝑖 are the solvent-equivalent polymerization lengths of the RNA & protein (assumed to be equal for simplicity) and 𝜒 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 are the various pairwise interaction terms. As before, we assume these interactions to be short-ranged at physiological salt levels. Choice of ( − 𝜒 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ) > 𝜒 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑠 > 0 and 𝜒 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 < 0 recapitulate the attractive contributions of protein-protein/protein-RNA interactions and repulsive RNA-RNA interactions. With these choices of constraints, the resulting free-energy looks similar to the phase diagram from the Landau approach with 𝑐 > 0 ( Figures S6 A and S6B) where the key F-H parameters are ( − 𝜒 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ) = 1.1, 𝜒 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑠 = 0.75, 𝜒 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 = − 0 . 6 , 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑟 𝑝 = 𝑟 𝑟 = 3 0 .
Numerical investigations of the coupled-equations outlined in Figure 4 C were performed with the FiPy package ( Guyer et al., 2009 46. Guyer, J.E. ∙ Wheeler, D. ∙ Warren, J.A. FiPy: Partial Differential Equations with Python Comput. Sci. Eng. 2009; 11 :6-15 Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar ). Simulations were performed on a 2-D/3-D square lattice ( 𝐿 𝑥 = 𝐿 𝑦 = 2 0 0 , 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑥 = 0 . 3 ; 𝐿 𝑥 = 𝐿 𝑦 = 𝐿 𝑧 = 4 0 , 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑥 = 1 . 0 ) and with adaptive time-stepping ( 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 = 1 ⁢ 𝑒 − 8 , 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 = 5 ⁢ 𝑒 − 1 ) until steady state is reached (which typically requires ∼10000 simulation steps).
The chemical potential for the protein components is calculated as: 𝜇 𝑝 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 = 2 ⁢ 𝜌 𝑠 ⁢ ( 𝜑 𝑝 − 𝛼 ) ⁢ ( 𝜑 𝑝 − 𝛽 ) ⁢ ( 2 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 − 𝛼 − 𝛽 ) − 𝜅 ∇ 2 𝜑 𝑝 − 𝜒 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑟 + 2 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝜑 2 𝑟 ⁢ 𝜑 𝑝 The radius of condensates was inferred from the volume of mesh regions where 𝜑 𝑝 ≥ ( 𝛼 + 𝛽 / 2 ) . The mobility of RNA and protein were chosen to be 1.0 unless mentioned elsewhere. The raw data for all figures from simulation data are provided along with the manuscript.
We designed simulations ( Figure 6 E) to study the effect of RNA features and rates of effective synthesis on condensate size. The rates of synthesis were changed by increasing k p by multiplicative factors (see x axis in Figure 6 E). Since RNA length is not explicitly incorporated in the model framework, we defined the effective local synthesis rates of longer RNA as a product of k p and an additional multiplicative factor (1,2, and 4x for short, medium, and long RNA respectively) to mimic increased local concentrations of RNA.
In estimating the number and charge of transcriptional proteins (Figure S1), we use previous estimates ( Cho et al., 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ) that suggest key transcriptional proteins such as Mediator are present at 10-100 molecules in transcriptional condensates. Further, molecules such as MED1 or BRD4 contain large disordered domains with net positive charge of +5 to to+40. This provides a highly approximate estimate of 25-500 as the effective positive charge. Since there are many more transcriptional proteins and most proteins tend to contain net positive charges, it is likely that this estimate represents lower bounds on the range. Steady-state levels of nascent eRNA ( Figure S1 ) suggest a range of 0.2-10 molecules, and since super-enhancers typically contain clusters of such active enhancers, we approximate the typical range of eRNA molecules at a transcriptional condensate between 1-10. Since RNA carries a charge of around −1 per nt ( Banerjee et al., 2017 8. Banerjee, P.R. ∙ Milin, A.N. ∙ Moosa, M.M. ... Reentrant Phase Transition Drives Dynamic Substructure Formation in Ribonucleoprotein Droplets Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2017; 56 :11354-11359 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ) and eRNAs are short (< 1 kb, ∼100 nt), we estimate the effective negative charge during initiation to be in the range 100-1000. During productive elongation, mRNAs are produced in bursts ranging from few to tens (1-50) and are typically longer (> 1kb, ∼10,000 nt), suggesting a conservative estimate of the effective charge to range from (10,000-1,000,000). It is important to stress that our approximations are performed with the aim of obtaining order-of-magnitude estimates and do not account for factors such as local composition of different proteins or extent to which nascent mRNAs may be coated by RNA-binding proteins. With the above numbers, we estimate concentrations based on a typical transcriptional condensate of size r = 0.25 μm ( Cho et al., 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ) that suggests that eRNA concentrations range about 10-200 nM and transcriptional proteins range 1-20 μM within the condensate.
As defined in the model ( Figure 4 B), the key rates of synthesis/degradation reactions are kp/kd, which have units of s -1 , and thus the relevant time-scales are 𝑡 𝑟 = 𝑘 − 1 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑘 − 1 𝑑 ) . Timescales of RNA transport depend on both the diffusivity as well as the size of the condensate (L) and is defined as 𝑡 𝑑 = 𝐿 2 / 𝑀 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑎 . We approximated the range of diffusivity of the nascent transcript at the lower end by the diffusivity of of chromatin, which ranges from 1 0 − 3 . 5 − 1 0 − 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑚 2 / 𝑠 ( Gu et al., 2018 44. Gu, B. ∙ Swigut, T. ∙ Spencley, A. ... Transcription-coupled changes in nuclear mobility of mammalian cis-regulatory elements Science. 2018; 359 :1050-1055 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ) and on the higher end by those of freely diffusing mRNPs, which can be upto 5 × 1 0 − 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑚 2 / 𝑠 ( Niewidok et al., 2018 81. Niewidok, B. ∙ Igaev, M. ∙ Pereira da Graca, A. ... Single-molecule imaging reveals dynamic biphasic partition of RNA-binding proteins in stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :1303-1318 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). By assuming a typical eRNA of size 100nt and Pol II transcription rates as ∼ 2 0 − 7 0 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 / 𝑠 ( Maiuri et al., 2011 73. Maiuri, P. ∙ Knezevich, A. ∙ De Marco, A. ... Fast transcription rates of RNA polymerase II in human cells EMBO Rep. 2011; 12 :1280-1285 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) we inferred typical synthesis rates of ∼ 0 . 5 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐴 s -1 Pol II -1 . In our previous work ( Cho et al., 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ), we have seen that clusters that contain multiple polymerases (> 5), are typically around 𝑟 ≈ 2 0 0 − 4 0 0 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑚 . Since super-enhancers typically contain clusters of enhancers with multiple sites of eRNA synthesis (∼5), this gives an effective synthesis rate of 𝑘 𝑝 ≈ 2 . 5 s -1 Pol II -1 . This allows us to approximately obtain the ratio of diffusive and reactive time-scales as 𝑡 𝑑 / 𝑡 𝑟 = 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑟 2 / 𝑀 ≈ 2 − 1 0 0 0 over the range of parameters including diffusivity and radii of cluster.
Charge-balance calculations were performed ( Figures 2 and S2–S4 ) employing the following method. Net protein charge per molecule was calculated as 𝐶 𝑝 = # ( 𝑅 , 𝐾 ) − # ( 𝐷 , 𝐸 ) for the relevant sequence including the GFP tag. RNA charge per molecule was calculated as 𝐶 𝑟 = − ( # 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑝 ) , assuming an approximate charge of −1 per nucleotide ( Lin et al., 2019 70. Lin, Y. ∙ McCarty, J. ∙ Rauch, J.N. ... Narrow equilibrium window for complex coacervation of tau and RNA under cellular conditions eLife. 2019; 8 :e42571 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, the charge balance ratio was computed at a particular RNA and protein concentration as: 𝐶 ⁡ ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 = 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝐶 𝑝 ⁡ [ 𝑃 ] , 𝐶 𝑟 ⁡ [ 𝑅 ] ) 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁡ ( 𝐶 𝑝 ⁡ [ 𝑃 ] , 𝐶 𝑟 ⁡ [ 𝑅 ] ) The effective concentration of MED1-IDR in our assays was 1 0 0 0 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑀 . Our results were not quantitatively affected by inclusion/exclusion of the partial charge on Histidine residues, partly due to their low frequency on the protein sequences. For Heparin, a charge of roughly −3 per monomer was employed ( Lin et al., 2020 71. Lin, Y. ∙ Fichou, Y. ∙ Zeng, Z. ... Electrostatically Driven Complex Coacervation and Amyloid Aggregation of Tau Are Independent Processes with Overlapping Conditions ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2020; 11 :615-627 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) and for single-stranded DNA, a charge of −1 per nt was employed. A comprehensive listing of charges of various species employed in this study are provided in Table S2 . The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between the median droplet partition value at different concentrations and the relevant charge-balance ratios and reported in Figures 2 and S2–S4 . A higher correlation implies that experimental data follow a similar qualitative trend as the estimated charge-balance curves. The code for performing these calculations are available at:
https://github.com/krishna-shrinivas/2020_Henninger_Oksuz_Shrinivas_RNA_feedback .
For small molecule inhibition experiments, cells were treated with 100 μM DRB (Sigma), or 1 μM Actinomycin-D (Sigma) in 2i media (detailed above) for 30 minutes, then imaged. For wash-out experiments, media was replaced with fresh 2i media and cells were allowed to recover for 1 hour, then the cells were imaged.
Cells with endogenously-tagged Med1-GFP ( Sabari et al., 2018 96. Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall’Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) were plated on glass-bottom dishes (Mattek) coated with poly-L-ornithine (Sigma) and laminin (ThermoFisher). Mock (DMSO) and treated cells were imaged on a LSM 880 Confocal Microscope with Airyscan to obtain super-resolution z stacks for at least 8 different fields containing multiple cells. For quantification, a manual threshold was applied equally across all conditions to remove background, and the size of Med1-GFP puncta was quantified in 3D using the 3D object counter plugin (Fiji/ImageJ).
HaloTag was endogenously knocked into 5′ end of Med19 via homology-directed repair (HDR) in mouse embryonic stem cells (R1 mESCs). Three single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting ± 100 bps from the start codons of Med19 gene were designed using the web-based CRISPR Design tool ( https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources ) and integrated into a Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 vector (Addgene #62988) for standard CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Single positive colonies were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and validated under the microscope.
Cells were cultured in serum-free 2i medium on poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and Laminin-coated flasks for more than two days and then were transferred onto coated imaging dishes for another day. Before imaging, cells were stained with (PA)-JF549-HaloTAG dye (a gift from Luke Lavis Lab, Janelia Research Campus) of 100nM concentration for 2 hours followed by a 60-minute wash in fresh 2i medium. Lastly, dishes were filled in with 2ml Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium (no phenol red, Thermo Fisher) and brought to the microscope for imaging.
Photo-activation localization microscopy (PALM) imaging was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a 100x oil immersion objective (NA 1.40) (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). A 405nm beam of 100mW power (attenuated with 25% AOTF) and a 561nm beam of 500mW power were columnated and superposed to perform simultaneous activation and excitation. The combined beam was expanded and re-collimated with an achromatic beam expander (AC254-040-A and AC508-300-A, THORLABS) to improve the uniformity of illumination across the whole region of interest (ROI 256ˆ2 pixels). Images were acquired with an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD camera (gain 1000, exposure time 50ms) interfaced through Micro Manager 1.4. 2400 frames were acquired for each imaging cycle. The cells were maintained at 37°C in a temperature-controlled platform (InVivo Scientific, St. Louis, MO) on the microscope stage during image acquisition. Med19-Halo cluster lifetimes were calculated as previously described using the qSR software (dark time tolerance = 20 frames, min cluster size = 50) ( Andrews et al., 2018 4. Andrews, J.O. ∙ Conway, W. ∙ Cho, W.-K. ... qSR: a quantitative super-resolution analysis tool reveals the cell-cycle dependent organization of RNA Polymerase I in live human cells Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :7424 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a cumulative distribution was generated using Prism software (GraphPad).
For the nascent RNA experiments in Figure S7A-7C, 1.25x10 5 wild-type mESCs were plated on coverslips coated with poly-L-ornithine (Sigma) and Laminin (ThermoFisher). After overnight plating, nascent RNA labeling with 2.5 mM EU was done with the Click-iT RNA Alexa Fluor 594 Imaging Kit (Thermofisher) according to manufacturer instructions for 10 minutes. After incubation, cells were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, washed 3X with PBS, then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 minutes. After the Click-iT reaction, coverslips were blocked with 4% RNase-free BSA in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies (1:500; rabbit Abcam ab64965 for MED1 and rat Millipore Sigma 04-1571 for Pol II-S2) in 4%BSA/PBS at room temperature overnight. The next day, coverslips were washed 3X with PBS, then incubated in secondary antibody (1:500; goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-488 Thermofisher A11008, goat anti-rat AlexaFluor-647 Invitrogen A21247) for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing 3X with PBS, coverslips were stained with 1:1000 Hoechst 33342 in PBS, incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed 3X with PBS, and mounted on imaging slides with Vectashield Mounting Media. Images were collected on the RPI Spinning Disk confocal. Representative images in Figure S7 A are single z-planes of median-subtracted (px = 10) and Gaussian smoothed (sigma = 1) channels to correct for uneven illumination and background.
For analysis of these images, nuclei were segmented using the Cellpose algorithm ( Stringer et al., 2020 112. Stringer, C. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Michaelos, M. ... Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) on the 405 Hoechst channel images. For average image analysis in Figure S7 B, all channel images were maximally projected, subtracted by median filter (px = 10), and Gaussian smoothed (sigma = 1). The center of MED1 and Pol II-S2 puncta were segmented as follows. The Laplace of Gaussian transformation (sigma = 3) was applied to the images using the scikit-image package in python, and puncta were identified above a threshold intensity 3 standard deviations above the mean of the image. All spots were confirmed to be in nuclei. A 1μm by 1μm box was centered on the spots, and the box subimage was collected for that region in both the processed MED1 and Pol II-S2 channel images. These subimages from > 10 imaged fields were stacked and averaged, which was the input for the contour plots in Figure S7 B. Radial intensity plots in Figure S7 C show the distribution of these averaged signals as a function of the distance from the center of the spot, along with their correlation to EU RNA signal.
Vectors used in the reporter assay are modified from pTETRIS-cargo vector, gift from J. M. Calabrese ( Kirk et al., 2018 55. Kirk, J.M. ∙ Kim, S.O. ∙ Inoue, K. ... Functional classification of long non-coding RNAs by k-mer content Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :1474-1482 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). 6X STOP codon sequence was cloned into NotI digested pTETRIS-cargo vector using Gibson cloning strategy by following the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB). This vector is called pTETRIS-cargo-STOP. The feedback gene and the reporter gene have their own polyA termination signal (200-300 bp) to terminate transcription. There is 51 bp between these two polyA signals that are facing each other. The reporter gene is regulated by a phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. Various versions of the pTETRIS-cargo-STOP using Gibson cloning strategy (NEB): i) the relative orientations of the feedback RNA and luciferase reporter were altered (tandem or divergent orientations) ii) feedback RNAs and luciferase reporter were cloned into separate vectors. Using Gibson cloning strategy (NEB), various RNA sequences were cloned downstream of the 6X STOP sequence to prevent translation of these RNAs. Stable cell lines for individual RNAs were generated by transfecting Med1-GFP mESCs with the following vectors: 1.0 μg pTETRIS-cargo-STOP containing individual RNAs, 1.0 μg rTTA-cargo, gift from J. M. Calabrese ( Kirk et al., 2018 55. Kirk, J.M. ∙ Kim, S.O. ∙ Inoue, K. ... Functional classification of long non-coding RNAs by k-mer content Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :1474-1482 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 1 μg piggyBAC transposase (Systems Biosciences). Cells were selected on puromycin (2 μg/ml) and G418 (200 μg/ml) for 1 week for successful integrations. For luciferase assays, 1x10 5 cells of each genotype were plated in triplicate on 0.2%-gelatin-coated 24-well plates and allowed to settle overnight. Cells were treated with doxycycline (Sigma) and harvested after 24 h to measure either luciferase activity or to purify RNA. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to manufacturer instructions. Luciferase signal was normalized to total protein content, measured by BCA protein assay kit (Invitrogen, #23227), and then normalized to a control not treated with doxycycline. To measure RNA expression, RNA was purified using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer instructions, cDNA was generated by Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer instructions, and 10 ng of cDNA was used in a qRT-PCR SYBR-green reaction (Life Technologies) with primers specific to a common sequence shared across the vectors (qPCR_Tetris; Table S1 ). Ct values were normalized to a housekeeping gene (qPCR_mActb; Table S1 ) and a control condition with no doxycycline treatment.
For the washout experiments in Figure S7 J, reporter cells were plated as described above. After 24 hours of dox treatment, media was replaced with fresh media, whereas control cell media was replaced with dox-containing media. After an additional 24 hours, luciferase levels were measured as described above. For the antisense oligo experiments of Figure S7 J, antisense oligos (LNA gapmers, QIAGEN) were designed using the QIAGEN GeneGlobe tool against the feedback RNA. A negative scrambled control was also included. Reporter cells were plated as described above in triplicate, and cells were transfected with 25 nM ASO with Lipofectamine-3000 (and no P3000 enhancer agent). After overnight transfection, cell media was replaced with dox-containing or fresh 2i media as a control. After 24 hour dox treatment, RNA and luciferase levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and luminescence, respectively, as described above. For the analysis of luciferase rescue, luminescence values of the dox conditions were first normalized to the no dox condition for that ASO, and then normalized to the dox condition of the negative scrambled control.
For imaging experiments in Figures 6 C and 6D, the reporter construct was modified using Gibson cloning to include a 24X-MS2 hairpin ( Cho et al., 2018 22. Cho, W.-K. ∙ Spille, J.-H. ∙ Hecht, M. ... Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates Science. 2018; 361 :412-415 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ) at the 5′ end of the RNA sequence (2,456 nt total). Cell lines with this construct and double MS2 capsid protein fused to an mCherry tag (2xMCP-mCherry) were generated as detailed above in a mESC background with endogenously-tagged Med1-GFP ( Sabari et al., 2018 96. Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall’Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). 1x10 6 reporter cells were plated on glass-bottom dishes (Mattek) coated with poly-L-ornithine (Sigma) and Laminin (ThermoFisher) After overnight plating, cells were treated with 10, 100, or 1000 ng/mL doxycycline for 24 hours. Cells were imaged on an RPI Spinning Disk Confocal with the following laser powers and exposure times: 488 70% 500 ms, 561 40% 300 ms. Images were maximum projected, median subtracted (px = 10), and Gaussian filtered (sigma = 1) to correct for uneven illumination and background subtraction. For analysis of these images in Figure 6 D, nuclei were segmented using the Cellpose algorithm ( Stringer et al., 2020 112. Stringer, C. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Michaelos, M. ... Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) on images from the 561 channel that had been subjected to a maximum and median filter (px = 10). For average image analysis, both the RNA and MED1-GFP channel images were maximally projected, subtracted by median filter (px = 10), and Gaussian smoothed (sigma = 1). The centers of RNA spots in a maximum projection of the 561 channel were manually marked using ImageJ. All spots were confirmed to be in nuclei. A 1μm by 1μm box was centered on the RNA spot, and the box subimage was collected for that region in both the processed RNA and MED1-GFP channel images. These subimages from > 10 imaged fields were stacked and averaged, which was the input for the contour plots in Figure 6 D. Radial intensity plots in Figure S7 D show the distribution of these averaged signals as a function of the distance from the center of the spot. To control for global Dox effects, we quantified the size, number, and partition ratio of MED1-GFP condensates in all conditions by using a threshold of 3 standard deviations above the mean intensity of the image to segment condensates. Partition ratio for each condensate was calculated as the average intensity inside the condensate divided by the average intensity of the nucleoplasm.
The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between the median droplet partition value at different concentrations and the relevant charge-balance ratios (see Calculation of charge balance under Method Details . The computed values are reported in Figures 2 and S2–S4 . In Figure S2 A, the correlation coefficient was computed between the median droplet turbidity at different conditions and the relevant charge-balance ratios. A higher correlation implies that experimental data follow a similar qualitative trend as the estimated charge-balance curves. The code for performing these calculations are available at:

The Student’s t test was used to determined whether the addition of spermine to the in vitro transcription assays led to statistically different outcomes in the mean of droplet size, partition ratio, and normalized transcription and the corresponding p values are reported in the figure legends ( Figures 3 D–3F). In the normalized transcription assay ( Figure 3 F), The values are normalized to the mean of the no spermine condition. The one-way ANOVA test is used to determine whether addition of exogenous RNA or absence of all NTPs leads to statistically different outcomes in droplet area or normalized transcription and the corresponding pairwise p values (compared to control conditions i.e., no addition of exogeneous RNA) are reported in the figure legends ( Figures 3 H and 3I). These tests were performed using PRISM.
PRISM was used to compute a one-way ANOVA comparison to test whether the mean of the condensate volumes (see Method Details ) was statistically different upon inhibition by DRB or ACT-D versus control (DMSO) and the corresponding p value is reported in the Figure legend ( Figure 5 E). Similarly, a one-way ANOVA comparison was used to test whether the mean of the condensate lifetimes (see Method Details ) were statistically different from control conditions (DMSO) and the corresponding p values are reported in the Figure Legend ( Figure 5 I).
A 2-way Kolmongorov-Smirnoff test was used to determine whether the cumulative distribution functions of the average MED1 intensity centered at RNA (see Method Details ) arising from replicates (values of n are represented in Figure 6 D) at different Dox concentrations were the same distribution. The p values are reported in the Figure legend ( Figure 6 D). Markers show the mean of at least 3 replicates and error bars depict the SD in Figures 6 F, 6G, and S7 . The Pearson correlation coefficient between the radial intensity distributions, computed from the averaged signal analysis (see Figure S7 B; Method Details ) was computed and this value is reported in Figure S7 C.
No methods were used to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach.
