Title: Translocated microbiome composition determines immunological outcome in treated HIV infection


Abstract: Summary

The impact of the microbiome on HIV disease is widely acknowledged although the mechanisms downstream of fluctuations in microbial composition remain speculative. We detected rapid, dynamic changes in translocated microbial constituents during two years after cART initiation. An unbiased systems biology approach revealed two distinct pathways driven by changes in the abundance ratio of Serratia to other bacterial genera. Increased CD4 T cell numbers over the first year were associated with high Serratia abundance, pro-inflammatory innate cytokines, and metabolites that drive Th17 gene expression signatures and restoration of mucosal integrity. Subsequently, decreased Serratia abundance and downregulation of innate cytokines allowed re-establishment of systemic T cell homeostasis promoting restoration of Th1 and Th2 gene expression signatures. Analyses of three other geographically distinct cohorts of treated HIV infection established a more generalized principle that changes in diversity and composition of translocated microbial species influence systemic inflammation and consequently CD4 T cell recovery.

Section: Introduction

Despite dramatic advances in the treatment of HIV infection with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), non-AIDS morbidity and mortality remain higher in treated HIV-infected compared to uninfected people ( Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort, 2008 2.

Heightened systemic T cell activation is associated with poor CD4 T cell reconstitution, which in turn predicts poor long-term clinical outcome ( Hileman and Funderburg, 2017 20. Hileman, C.O. ∙ Funderburg, N.T. Inflammation, Immune Activation, and Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV Curr. HIV/AIDS Rep. 2017; 14 :93-100 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, raised circulating markers of inflammation, particularly interleukin (IL)-6 and D-dimers, are highly significant predictors of long-term morbidity and mortality during cART independently of plasma virus load and CD4 T cell count ( Hunt, 2012 22. Hunt, P.W. HIV and inflammation: mechanisms and consequences Curr. HIV/AIDS Rep. 2012; 9 :139-147 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hunt et al., 2014 23.

Dis. 2014; 210 :1248-1259 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ). The term immune activation is often used to refer to activation of the adaptive immune system, while the term inflammation is generally reserved for innate immune activation. This distinction is somewhat artificial, however, as these arms of the immune system are clearly interdependent; for example, the paradigmatic innate cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 are required for T helper (Th) 17 cell differentiation ( Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007 1. Acosta-Rodriguez, E.V. ∙ Napolitani, G. ∙ Lanzavecchia, A. ... Interleukins 1beta and 6 but not transforming growth factor-beta are essential for the differentiation of interleukin 17-producing human T helper cells Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8 :942-949 Crossref Scopus (1582) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we henceforth simply use the term “inflammation” to refer to activation of the immune system. Importantly, while inflammation and CD4 T cell reconstitution are clearly associated, they may be considered independent predictors of clinical outcome ( Hunt et al., 2016 24. Hunt, P.W. ∙ Lee, S.A. ∙ Siedner, M.J. Immunologic Biomarkers, Morbidity, and Mortality in Treated HIV Infection J. Infect. Dis. 2016; 214 :S44-S50 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hunt et al., 2014 23. Hunt, P.W. ∙ Sinclair, E. ∙ Rodriguez, B. ...

Dis. 2014; 210 :1248-1259 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ). A paradox emerges, however, when considering the tempo of immune recovery upon cART initiation. The short term—that is, the rapid restoration of immunity particularly at mucosal surfaces which is characterized in part by robust Th17 immunity—is by definition a manifestation of inflammation and is beneficial to the host ( Antonelli et al., 2010 3. Antonelli, L.R. ∙ Mahnke, Y. ∙ Hodge, J.N. ... Elevated frequencies of highly activated CD4+ T cells in HIV+ patients developing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome Blood. 2010; 116 :3818-3827 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in the long term, the association between inflammation and CD4 T cell reconstitution is clearly a negative one.
An integrated assessment of host immunity—both soluble and cellular—microbiome, and metabolic factors is essential for understanding the role of inflammation in reconstituting the immune system after the initiation of cART. Among the many proposed causes of inflammation in treated and untreated HIV infection is microbial translocation. Early in HIV infection, massive depletion of gastrointestinal CD4 T cells, particularly Th17 cells, and the concomitant structural damage to the epithelium result in dramatically increased intestinal permeability and the translocation of microbial products across this compromised mucosal barrier into the systemic circulation ( Hunt, 2010 21. Hunt, P.W. Th17, gut, and HIV: therapeutic implications Curr. Opin. HIV AIDS. 2010; 5 :189-193 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Klatt and Brenchley, 2010 28. Klatt, N.R. ∙ Brenchley, J.M. Th17 cell dynamics in HIV infection Curr. Opin. HIV AIDS. 2010; 5 :135-140 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ; Marchetti et al., 2013 33. Marchetti, G. ∙ Tincati, C. ∙ Silvestri, G. Microbial translocation in the pathogenesis of HIV infection and AIDS Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2013; 26 :2-18 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting persistent inflammation is ultimately associated with HIV clinical progression and the onset of non-AIDS comorbidities ( Marchetti et al., 2013 33. Marchetti, G. ∙ Tincati, C. ∙ Silvestri, G. Microbial translocation in the pathogenesis of HIV infection and AIDS Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2013; 26 :2-18 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, while some studies have shown there to be a concomitant gut microbiome dysbiosis ( Dillon et al., 2014 10. Dillon, S.M. ∙ Lee, E.J. ∙ Kotter, C.V. ... An altered intestinal mucosal microbiome in HIV-1 infection is associated with mucosal and systemic immune activation and endotoxemia Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7 :983-994 Crossref Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ), others suggest that while bacterial richness is reduced, dysbiosis occurs only when CD4 T cell counts are very low ( Guillén et al., 2019 17. Guillén, Y. ∙ Noguera-Julian, M. ∙ Rivera, J. ... Low nadir CD4+ T-cell counts predict gut dysbiosis in HIV-1 infection Mucosal Immunol. 2019; 12 :232-246 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Noguera-Julian et al., 2016 39. Noguera-Julian, M. ∙ Rocafort, M. ∙ Guillén, Y. ... Gut Microbiota Linked to Sexual Preference and HIV Infection EBioMedicine. 2016; 5 :135-146 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). In ART-treated HIV infection, the composition of the gut microbiome remains altered compared to that in uninfected persons ( Dubourg et al., 2017 12. Dubourg, G. ∙ Surenaud, M. ∙ Lévy, Y. ... Microbiome of HIV-infected people Microb. Pathog. 2017; 106 :85-93 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, while some studies report associations between dysbiosis and HIV disease progression ( Hensley-McBain et al., 2019 19. Hensley-McBain, T. ∙ Wu, M.C. ∙ Manuzak, J.A. ... Increased mucosal neutrophil survival is associated with altered microbiota in HIV infection PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1007672 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2013 56. Vujkovic-Cvijin, I. ∙ Dunham, R.M. ∙ Iwai, S. ... Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with HIV disease progression and tryptophan catabolism Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5 :193ra91 Crossref Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ), others suggest that the deleterious effects of microbial translocation do not depend on dysbiosis per se ( Ortiz et al., 2018 40. Ortiz, A.M. ∙ Flynn, J.K. ∙ DiNapoli, S.R. ... Experimental microbial dysbiosis does not promote disease progression in SIV-infected macaques Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1313-1316 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, it therefore seems likely that, aside from the actual constituents of the gut microbiome, control of that microbiome at the mucosal barrier is of paramount importance in mitigating the translocation of distinct bacterial species and their consequential effects on systemic inflammation.
To overcome the complexity of the different factors that can impact immune reconstitution, we employed a systems biology approach to reveal remarkably rapid and dynamic patterns of change in constituents of the microbiome and their interaction with innate and adaptive components of the immune system for a period of two years after cART initiation. Integration of these multiple components defined how these interactions determine the overall inflammatory status of an individual, drive the differentiation and metabolic profiles of innate and adaptive immune cells, and set the trajectory of CD4 T cell recovery.

Section: Results

Eleven treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals were recruited at the Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC) in Kampala, Uganda for a study assessing the impact of antiretroviral treatment over two years, as fully described in the STAR Methods section ( Rothenberger et al., 2019 46. Rothenberger, M. ∙ Nganou-Makamdop, K. ∙ Kityo, C. ... Impact of Integrase Inhibition Compared With Nonnucleoside Inhibition on HIV Reservoirs in Lymphoid Tissues J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2019; 81 :355-360 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following cART initiation, HIV plasma load decreased an average 100-fold by day 7 (p = 0.001; Figure S1 A). Complete virus suppression was achieved after 3–4 months on cART in all but one participant who had poor adherence until month 6. There was a significant increase in the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio at months 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 compared to baseline (p < 0.0001; Figure S1 B), with an initial recovery by month 4 (median 1.8-fold increase) that further increased by month 24 (median 4-fold increase).
We first measured multiple plasma cytokines and chemokines to gauge the level of systemic inflammation before cART initiation in our cohort. All participants had markedly elevated levels of Th1, Th2, Th17, and innate markers compared to HIV-uninfected Ugandans (0.03 < p < 0.0001; Figure S1 C), reflecting a dysregulated pattern of inflammation. With full virus suppression at month 3 and initial CD4 T cell recovery observed at month 4, we expected a rapid normalization of cytokine and chemokine levels (henceforth collectively referred to as “cytokines”). However, longitudinal measurement of plasma cytokine levels revealed that they were in fact highly dynamic, with marked increases and decreases of different cytokines at different time points over the course of 24 months on cART. Principal-component analysis (PCA) indicated a distinction between specific time points after cART initiation and was characterized by two different sets of cytokines. Elevated plasma levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, MIP-1β, IL-17A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) characterized months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Elevated plasma levels of interferon (IFN) γ, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, IL-10, and MCP-1 characterized months 4 and 24 ( Figure 1 A). Using the gap-statistic method, five distinct cytokine clusters were identified ( Figure S1 D). Cluster 1 cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1β, increased following cART initiation, transiently declined at month 4 before further increasing up to month 12, and finally declining by month 24 ( Figure 1 B). These cytokines are known to trigger pro-inflammatory pathways and are produced by myeloid lineage innate immune cells; henceforth, these will be termed “pro-inflammatory” cytokines. Cluster 2 cytokines, TNF and IL-17, both steadily increased between baseline and month 12 and declined by month 24 ( Figure 1 C); these will be termed Th17 cytokines. Cluster 3 cytokines, IFNγ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, G-CSF, and MCP-1, were lower during the first year on cART, with a transient increase at month 4 and at month 24; these will be termed Th1/Th2 cytokines ( Figure 1 D). IP-10 and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) did not change significantly over time and were assigned to two independent clusters (clusters 4 and 5, respectively; Figures S1 E and S1F). The summarized trends of clusters 1–3 showed that cluster 1 had the greatest fold change in plasma concentrations with up to 2.5-fold increase or decrease in the early months on cART (months 3 to 9; Figure 1 E). In addition, we observed a positive correlation between clusters 1 and 2 (p < 0.0001, ρ = 0.8) and an inverse correlation between these clusters and cluster 3 (clusters 1 and 3: p < 0.0001, ρ = −0.5; clusters 2 and 3: p = 0.04, ρ = −0.4), denoting a possible counterbalance between responses driving the production of these cytokines ( Figure S1 G). Importantly, CD4 T cell reconstitution, a critical measure of clinical outcome (reflected by the CD4 to CD8 T cell ratio) positively correlated with increased cluster 1 and 2 cytokines at month 12 but with decreased cluster 1 and 2 cytokines and increased cluster 3 cytokines at month 24 ( Figure 1 F). Fluctuations in plasma cytokine levels in these aviremic study participants with cART-suppressed HIV prompted us to explore microbial translocation, a major driver of inflammation in cART-treated HIV infection.
To obtain a broad qualitative and quantitative overview of the components of the host microbiome which might be recognized by systemic immune cells, we performed shotgun deep sequencing of cell-free DNA and RNA fragments in plasma at months 0, 3, 4, 9, 12, and 24 after cART initiation. The approach we used ( Morou et al., 2019 35. Morou, A. ∙ Brunet-Ratnasingham, E. ∙ Dubé, M. ... Altered differentiation is central to HIV-specific CD4 + T cell dysfunction in progressive disease Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :1059-1070 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) is sequence agnostic and provides a measure of the viral, bacterial, fungal, and other microbial abundances that can access an individual’s circulation. This method does not differentiate between nucleic acids derived from whole organisms, microbial debris, or exosomes but provides a surrogate of all microbial products that translocate into the circulation from various tissues, most notably the gut ( Castillo et al., 2019 6. Castillo, D.J. ∙ Rifkin, R.F. ∙ Cowan, D.A. ... The Healthy Human Blood Microbiome: Fact or Fiction? Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2019; 9 :148 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thursby and Juge, 2017 52. Thursby, E. ∙ Juge, N. Introduction to the human gut microbiota Biochem. J. 2017; 474 :1823-1836 Crossref Scopus (2019) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, our approach represents a very recent history of the non-human genetic burden as circulating nucleic acids are typically short lived ( Diehl et al., 2008 9. Diehl, F. ∙ Schmidt, K. ∙ Choti, M.A. ... Circulating mutant DNA to assess tumor dynamics Nat. Med. 2008; 14 :985-990 Crossref Scopus (2153) PubMed Google Scholar ; To et al., 2003 54. To, E.W. ∙ Chan, K.C. ∙ Leung, S.F. ... Rapid clearance of plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA after surgical treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9 :3254-3259 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Assessment of beta diversity followed by hierarchical clustering revealed dissimilarities in the composition of microbial nucleic acids between time points—months 3, 9, and 12—and were close to baseline while showing a high degree of dissimilarity compared to months 4 and 24 ( Figure 2 A). Moreover, clustering of these microbial nucleic acids coincided with the clustering of plasma cytokines: the microbial composition specific to months 3, 9, and 12 correlated with increased pro-inflammatory and Th17 cytokines (clusters 1 and 2), while the microbial composition at months 4 and 24 was associated with increased Th1/Th2 cytokines (cluster 3). Further assessment showed low alpha diversity at months 3, 9, and 12 but high alpha diversity at months 4 and 24 ( Figure 2 B). Overall, measures of microbial beta diversity, alpha diversity, and plasma cytokine profiles at months 3, 9, and 12 differed from those at months 4 and 24 ( Figure S2 A). Initial analysis of microbial sequences at the phylum level (for bacteria and eukaryotes) and family level (for viruses) ( Figure S2 B) revealed a dominance of bacteria, specifically Proteobacteria, over other organisms ( Figure 2 C). Within the kingdom Bacteria, the next most prevalent phyla were Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, which all correlated positively with one another but inversely with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria ( Figure 2 D). Of note, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was high at months 0, 3, 9, and 12 but significantly lower at months 4 and 24, while the abundance of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were higher at months 4 and 24 ( Figure S2 C). These data suggest that the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes are largely responsible for the beta diversity and alpha diversity changes measured at the specific time points noted above. Furthermore, these data raise the possibility of a causal relationship between the relative abundances of distinct bacteria within these phyla and the fluctuations we observed in plasma cytokine profiles across time after cART initiation.
To further identify bacteria driving the fluctuations in systemic inflammation after cART initiation, we analyzed our microbial dataset at lower taxonomic levels with a focus on Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Because multiple closely related species were identified within each of the dominant genera, we opted for further data analysis at the genus level. The genus Serratia , in the family Enterobacteriaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria, was the most abundant with 9-fold-higher levels compared to any other genus within the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, or Firmicutes ( Figure 3 A). The second most abundant genus was Pseudomonas , in the family Pseudomonaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria, with a 4-fold-lower abundance compared to Serratia and 6-fold-higher abundance compared to all other genera. The abundance of Serratia was at its highest at the time points with lower abundances of all other genera, including Pseudomonas ( Figure S2 D). To explore the relationship between the abundance of these genera and fluctuations in plasma cytokine levels, we integrated these two datasets over time using a projection-based modeling approach (see STAR Methods ). Increased Serratia abundance correlated with an increase in mostly pro-inflammatory and Th17 cytokines but was associated with a decrease in Th1/Th2 cytokines ( Figure 3 B). In contrast, we found that the abundance of Pseudomonas and several genera belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory and Th17 cytokine levels and positively correlated with Th1/Th2 cytokine levels. The observation that two genera ( Serratia and Pseudomonas ) from the same phylum (Proteobacteria) are associated with opposite cytokine profiles in plasma should not be surprising in light of reports showing that LPS originating from different bacteria may elicit different immune responses ( Pulendran et al., 2001 41. Pulendran, B. ∙ Kumar, P. ∙ Cutler, C.W. ... Lipopolysaccharides from distinct pathogens induce different classes of immune responses in vivo J. Immunol. 2001; 167 :5067-5076 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ) that and bacteria from the same phylum can induce different innate immune responses due to distinct lipid A structures ( Munford, 2008 36. Munford, R.S. Sensing gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides: a human disease determinant? Infect. Immun. 2008; 76 :454-465 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, the ratio of Serratia to all other bacteria genera among Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (henceforth termed the Serratia ratio) was associated with increased pro-inflammatory and Th17 cytokine levels but decreased Th1/Th2 cytokine levels, whereas a low ratio was associated with decreased pro-inflammatory and Th17 cytokine levels but increased Th1/Th2 cytokine levels ( Figure 3 C). This suggests that changes in the microbial balance favoring Serratia over other genera contributed to disruption of immune homeostasis.
To explore the possibility of a causal link between abundance of different bacterial genera and plasma cytokine profile suggested by our data, we measured cytokine production after in vitro stimulation of PBMC from healthy donors with Serratia marcescens (phylum Proteobacteria), Corynebacterium ihumii (phylum Actinobacteria), Bacteroides fragilis (phylum Bacteroidetes), Lactobacillus plantarum (phylum Firmicutes), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (phylum Proteobacteria). The short 18 h stimulation of this experiment was optimal for measuring cytokine output from stimulated myeloid cells. PCA showed a clear distinction in cytokine profiles under the different stimulation conditions, with the first dimension attributed to the type of bacterial strain (gram-positive L. Plantarum versus gram-negative others) and the second dimension driven by Serratia marcescens -specific responses ( Figure 3 D). Complementing our ex vivo findings, stimulation with Serratia marcescens resulted in a significantly different cytokine profile from that induced by all other species tested, with high production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF and low production of MCP-1, whereas the other species induced low production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF and high MCP-1 ( Figure 3 E). Interestingly, high concentrations of IL-1β and IL-6 (features of cluster 1 cytokines), required for Th17 differentiation ( Bettelli et al., 2006 4. Bettelli, E. ∙ Carrier, Y. ∙ Gao, W. ... Reciprocal developmental pathways for the generation of pathogenic effector TH17 and regulatory T cells Nature. 2006; 441 :235-238 Crossref Scopus (5881) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mailer et al., 2015 32. Mailer, R.K. ∙ Joly, A.L. ∙ Liu, S. ... IL-1β promotes Th17 differentiation by inducing alternative splicing of FOXP3 Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :14674 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), were induced by stimulation with Serratia . Our in vitro culture experiments confirm that the innate cytokine profile after stimulation with Serratia is consistent with the ex vivo measured pro-inflammatory (cluster 1) and Th17 cytokines (cluster 2).
Having established a potential causal relationship between the abundance of different bacterial genera relative to each other and the fluctuations in plasma cytokine levels after cART initiation, we next sought to explore whether changes in immune cell differentiation programs act as the mechanistic bridge between bacterial stimulation and cytokine production. Thus, we performed transcriptomic analysis of sorted monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), and T cells from our study participants at baseline and months 3, 12, and 24 on cART. Unsupervised analysis of transcriptome data showed that cell subset was a major driver of cluster segregation followed by time point after cART initiation within each subset ( Figures S3 A–S3D). At baseline, monocytes and mDCs showed higher expression of several cytokines and chemokines known to drive pro-inflammatory responses (including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1β), while expression of IL-12 and IFNγ was specific to T cells. In addition, several pro-inflammatory response pathways (including genes of the type I and type II IFN response, IL-6, and TNF signaling pathways) were highly expressed by the monocytes and mDCs, indicative of innate immune cell inflammatory pathway activation before cART ( Figure S3 E).
Following cART initiation, we observed increased expression of genes involved in several inflammatory pathways in monocytes including type I and type II IFN, IL-6 signaling, and TNF signaling at months 3 and 12 followed by downregulation at month 24. The increase in type I/II IFN signaling was characterized by induction of transcription factors including STAT1, STAT4, IRF7, and IRF9. Consequently, upregulation of IFN-inducible genes (e.g., IFIs, ISGs, IFITs, GBPs, and OASs) and innate anti-viral genes (e.g., MX1 and MX2) was observed. Similarly, upregulation of innate pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma (e.g., IL-6 and TNF) was seen in conjunction with increased gene expression of chemokines and cytokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL5, CXCL11, and IL-6) and their upstream master transcription factors (e.g., STAT3, NFKB1/2, RELA, and JUNB) ( Figure 4 A; Table S1 ). These peak inflammatory responses correlated with a higher Serratia ratio and higher cluster 1 and cluster 2 plasma cytokine levels ( Figure 4 A). In silico deconvolution showed equal frequencies of classical (CD14 + CD16 lo ) and inflammatory non-classical (CD16 + CD14 lo ) monocytes ( Yang et al., 2014 58. Yang, J. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, C. ... Monocyte and macrophage differentiation: circulation inflammatory monocyte as biomarker for inflammatory diseases Biomark. Res. 2014; 2 :1 Crossref Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar ) at baseline, higher frequencies of non-classical monocytes at months 3 and 12; and a higher frequency of classical monocytes at month 24 ( Figure S4 A). Alterations in the transcriptomic profiles of mDCs were similar to monocytes, showing higher inflammatory response pathways ( Figure S4 B). Together, the in vitro PBMC cytokine responses to Serratia stimulation and the differentiation states of monocytes at months 3 and 12 when the Serratia ratio was high indicate that conditions favoring Th17 differentiation would exist during this early phase of T cell recovery. Indeed, we found that previously validated Th17 specific gene signatures (see STAR Methods ) were elevated in T cells at months 3 and 12 ( Figure 4 B; Table S1 ). Here, increased expression of master transcription factors such as RORA, a master regulator of Th17 differentiation, and STAT3, a conductor of IL-6-driven Th17 responses, was observed. Higher expression of Th17-cell-subset-specific surface markers such as CCR6 and TGFBR2 was also seen. These responses synergized with an increase in plasma IL-17 at months 3 and 12 ( Figure 1 C). In these T cells, upregulation of the expression of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10, which recruit monocytes and dendritic cells to sites of inflammation ( Jardine et al., 2019 25. Jardine, L. ∙ Wiscombe, S. ∙ Reynolds, G. ... Lipopolysaccharide inhalation recruits monocytes and dendritic cell subsets to the alveolar airspace Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1999 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), was concurrent with the increase in inflammatory signatures in monocytes and mDCs at months 3 and 12. At month 24, however, a complete reversal of this pro-inflammatory state was observed, which, as discussed above, coincided with reduced Serratia ratio and a downregulation of monocyte inflammatory pathways. Here, a reduction in plasma IL-17 and an increase in IFNγ and IL-4, suggestive of relatively greater Th1 and Th2 differentiation, was observed (differentially expressed Th1 and Th2 genes listed in Table S2 ). In line with these data, a significant enrichment in targets of GATA3 (a key regulator of Th2 differentiation), which included ZBTB7A (a member of the ThPOK-LRF complex implicated in Th2 differentiation) and JUNB was also observed at month 24. Finally, an increase in plasma IL-10, which was suggestive of a return to anti-inflammatory T cell responses, and IL-7, a driver of homeostatic T cell expansion, was observed with an increase in targets of TCF7 (e.g., WNTs and DNMT3A [ Zarkou et al., 2018 60. Zarkou, V. ∙ Galaras, A. ∙ Giakountis, A. ... Crosstalk mechanisms between the WNT signaling pathway and long non-coding RNAs Noncoding RNA Res. 2018; 3 :42-53 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ]) ( Figure 4 B). Overall, our observations suggest that increased T cell homeostasis and reduced pro-inflammatory responses promote higher CD4:CD8 T cell ratios 2 years after cART.
The host microbiome may regulate metabolic functions of immune cells and affect the balance between homeostasis and inflammation ( Van Welden et al., 2017 55. Van Welden, S. ∙ Selfridge, A.C. ∙ Hindryckx, P. Intestinal hypoxia and hypoxia-induced signalling as therapeutic targets for IBD Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2017; 14 :596-611 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized that in our study participants, changes in host cell metabolic functions may be a mechanism by which changes in proportions of translocating bacteria influence cellular differentiation and immune recovery under cART. Analysis of our transcriptome data from sorted monocytes revealed an upregulation of glycolysis- (e.g., ENO1/2, GAPDH, and HK2) and hypoxia-associated (e.g., ATF3, HIF1A, and LDHA) genes concomitant with a downregulation of several pathways that define mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation (e.g., NDUFs, ATPases, COXs, and cytochrome genes), fatty acid oxidation (e.g., CPT1B, CPT1C, ALDH, and ADH) and transfer of acetyl groups or carnitine synthesis, all of which correlated with a higher Serratia ratio at months 3 and 12 ( Figure 4 C; Table S3 ). Decreased Serratia ratio at month 24 was accompanied by reduced expression of glycolysis- and hypoxia-associated genes as well as an increase of genes involved in mitochondrial function. Similar changes in metabolic pathways were observed in T cells with downregulation of mitochondrial pathway genes at months 3 and 12, when the Serratia ratio was high ( Figure S4 C), followed by upregulation at month 24 when the Serratia ratio was low.
To confirm our observation of increased expression of hypoxia- and glycolysis-associated genes and reduced metabolic function of the host cells at months 3 and 12, we quantified plasma metabolites by mass spectroscopy and performed an integrated analysis with the transcriptome and Serratia ratio. A higher Serratia ratio correlated with high concentrations of plasma lactate and pyruvate which in turn correlated with the upregulation of glycolytic and hypoxia-associated gene pathways ( Figure 4 D). Previous studies have shown that cells under inflammatory conditions are hypoxic and harvest energy via glycolysis as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation ( Zheng, 2012 61. Zheng, J. Energy metabolism of cancer: Glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (Review) Oncol. Lett. 2012; 4 :1151-1157 Crossref Scopus (676) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study participants, increased plasma concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, most likely of host origin, correlated with several plasma long-chain acylcarnitines. Moreover, plasma levels of acylcarnitines were indirectly associated with higher Serratia ratio and increased Th17 gene expression signatures, in line with prior observations that an environment rich in long-chain acylcarnitines induces immune cells with compromised mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to produce Th17 cytokines that define inflammation ( Nicholas et al., 2019 38. Nicholas, D.A. ∙ Proctor, E.A. ∙ Agrawal, M. ... Fatty Acid Metabolites Combine with Reduced beta Oxidation to Activate Th17 Inflammation in Human Type 2 Diabetes Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :447-461.e445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ultimately, higher acylcarnitines correlated with higher CD4:CD8 T cell ratio at month 12, whereas lower lactate and pyruvate levels were associated with an increase in CD4 T cell reconstitution at month 24 on cART.
In order to identify the key drivers of CD4 T cell reconstitution after cART initiation, we generated a multi-omic network that highlights significant univariate correlations between plasma cytokines, metabolites, gene expression profiles, and plasma microbial nucleotides in cART-treated HIV infection ( Figure 5 ). Our model indicates that a higher Serratia ratio during the first year on cART is associated with higher plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including those that are Th17 differentiating (IL-6, IL-1β) and phenotypic (IL-17), which are directly correlated with an increased CD4:CD8 T cell ratio during year 1. In contrast, a reduced Serratia ratio contributed to greater CD4 T cell reconstitution during the second year on cART ( Figure S5 ). Here, increases in the levels of anti-inflammatory (e.g., IL-10) and homeostatic (e.g., IL-7) plasma cytokines were observed along with the transcription factors TCF7 and β-catenin that drive homeostatic expansion, reduced levels of glycolytic metabolites, and higher expression of genes implicated in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, increased Th1 and Th2 differentiation states together with increased plasma levels of IFNγ and IL-4 was observed. Together these data suggest that a reduced Serratia ratio, restored T cell homeostasis, and resolution of Th17 responses promote higher CD4:CD8 T cell ratios during the second year on cART.
To validate our principal findings, we assessed CD4 T cell counts, CD4:CD8 T cell ratios, plasma microbial nucleic acids, and plasma cytokine levels in three additional independent cohorts comprising 98 participants in total. These diverse cohorts included participants from Uganda, Cleveland, and Montreal and were thus expected to show differences in the composition of the translocated microbiome due to ethnic and geographical disparities ( Yatsunenko et al., 2012 59. Yatsunenko, T. ∙ Rey, F.E. ∙ Manary, M.J. ... Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography Nature. 2012; 486 :222-227 Crossref Scopus (5629) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, we assessed whether the overriding principle that the diversity and composition of translocated bacterial nucleic acids are associated with plasma cytokines and that clinical outcome could be generalized irrespective of the time on cART, disease status, host genetics, or environment. These independent cohorts included 11 paired pre- and post-cART time points. The second Uganda cohort consisted of 20 participants: 7 HIV-uninfected, 10 HIV-infected on cART, and 3 paired HIV-infected pre-cART. The Montreal cohort consisted of 34 participants: 6 HIV-uninfected and 28 HIV-infected, of which 5 were elite controllers, 3 viremic progressors of which 1 had a paired post-cART time point, and 12 chronic progressors pre-cART of which 8 had a paired post-cART time point. The Cleveland cohort consisted of HIV-infected participants on cART, of which 11 had robust immune recovery (immune responders, IR) and 44 had poor immune recovery (immune non-responders, INR). Detailed characteristics of these cohorts are presented in the STAR Methods section and Table S4 . Median pre-cART CD4 T cells counts were lower than post-cART in participants of both the Montreal (310 versus 640 CD4 T cells/mm 3 blood; p = 0.0098) and Uganda (377 versus 656 CD4 T cells/mm 3 blood; p = 0.2168) cohorts, although this was not statistically significant in the Uganda cohort due to limited sample size ( Figure S6 A). Concurrently, although lower median CD4:CD8 T cell ratios were observed in pre-cART versus post-cART individuals from Montreal (0.31:1.00 versus 0.61:1.00; p = 0.0831) and Uganda (0.44:1.00 versus 1.11:1.00; p = 0.2168), these differences were not significant ( Figure 6 A). CD4 T cell counts and CD4:CD8 T cell ratio were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in the INR versus the IR in the Cleveland cohort ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). Finally, no significant differences were observed in either CD4 T cell count or CD4:CD8 T cell ratio between individuals from the two controller groups (Montreal cohort) or between HIV-uninfected people in Uganda and Montreal cohorts ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). In line with the poor outcomes observed in individuals from pre-cART and INR groups, the median diversity of bacterial nucleic acids in plasma (defined by the Shannon diversity index) in these groups was also lower (Montreal cohort: p = 0.0358; Cleveland cohort: p = 0.062; Uganda cohort: p = 0.16) ( Figure 6 B). In contrast, no significant alterations in diversity were observed between individuals from the two controller groups (Montreal cohort) or among HIV-uninfected people from Uganda and Montreal cohorts ( Figure 6 B). Most importantly, an aggregated evaluation of the association of microbial diversity with CD4 T cell counts or CD4:CD8 T cell ratio, across all participants, revealed a strong positive correlation of Shannon diversity index with both CD4 T cell count (ρ = 0.37, p < 0.0001; Figure S6 B) and CD4:CD8 T cell ratio (ρ = 0.24, p < 0.017; Figure S6 C).
Upon assessment of the relationship between microbial diversity and composition of the bacterial nucleic acids in plasma, we observed that the Shannon diversity index in each cohort consistently negatively correlated with the abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria in IR and INR of the Cleveland cohort (ρ = −0.50; p < 0.0001) as well as in pre- and post-cART participants of the Montreal (ρ = −0.48; p = 0.0388) and Uganda cohorts (ρ = −0.49; p = 0.0858). Furthermore, Proteobacteria abundance in IR and INR of the Cleveland cohort also negatively correlated with CD4:CD8 T cell ratio (ρ = −0.32; p = 0.0318; Figure 6 C). In contrast, CD4:CD8 T cell ratios among pre- and post-cART participants of the Uganda cohort were positively associated with abundances of the Bacteroidetes (ρ = 0.63; p = 0.0205) and Firmicutes (ρ = 0.54; p = 0.0576) phyla. However, a direct negative correlation between the abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria and other major bacterial phyla was not observed ( Figure S6 D). These observations support the hypothesis proposed by our initial findings that the diversity and composition of the translocated microbiome dictates clinical outcome in HIV infection as determined by CD4 T cell count and CD4:CD8 T cell ratio.
To conduct a more detailed evaluation of the composition of the translocated microbiome in our independent cohorts, we further analyzed all bacterial genera that were detected in >50% of study participants in at least one of the 10 subgroups of individuals (elite and viremic controllers, pre- and post-cART, IR and INR, and HIV-uninfected individuals; see Table S5 for the list of selected genera and detailed bioinformatic approach in the STAR Methods ). We observed that 20 genera, the majority of which were from the class Betaproteobacteria, were significantly different in HIV-uninfected people from the Uganda compared to the Montreal cohort, confirming cohort-related difference in microbiome composition ( Figure S6 E; Table S5 ). Similar analyses assessing changes in microbial composition pre- versus post-cART in the Uganda and Montreal cohorts revealed that genera from the phylum Firmicute, including Lactobacillus and Streptococcus , and the phylum Actinobacteria, including Dermacoccus and Corynebacterium , were significantly enriched post-cART, whereas more robust long-term CD4 T cell reconstitution post-cART in the Cleveland cohort was associated with a decline in several Proteobacterial genera, including Serratia and genera from the class Betaproteobacteria ( Figure 6 D; Table S6 ).
We further explored in each HIV-infected cohort the association between specific microbial abundance, plasma cytokine profile, and CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. Univariate correlates of CD4:CD8 T cell ratio in the Cleveland cohort predominantly included genera from the phylum Proteobacteria and higher plasma cytokine levels of IL-7, IL-8, IL-29, IP-10, and TGF-β ( Figure 6 E). In the Montreal cohort, lower CD4:CD8 T cell ratio was associated with Pseudomonas abundance and higher plasma concentrations of GM-CSF, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-18, IP-10, MIP-1α, SDF-1α, TNF, and TGF-β ( Figure 6 E). In the Uganda cohort, higher CD4:CD8 T cell ratio was associated with higher abundances of the Actinobacteria genus Gardnerella and Firmicute genus Streptococcus in cART-treated persons and higher plasma levels of IL-33 ( Figure 6 E). We also applied LASSO feature selection with leave-one-out cross-validation to identify a microbial or cytokine signature that best predicted the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio in each cohort. Microbial communities dominated by Proteobacterial genera in both Montreal and Uganda pre- and post-cART cohorts were drivers of low CD4:CD8 T cell ratio and associated with a cohort-specific inflammatory milieu ( Figure S6 F). In contrast to the pre- and post-cART cohorts, the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio in the Cleveland cohort was most accurately predicted by equal representation from both Proteobacteria and the other major phyla (i.e., Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes) and a cytokine milieu that reflected both pro- and anti-inflammatory (such as IL-8 and TGF-β1, respectively) properties. Thus, while the precise relationships between plasma cytokines and the translocated microbiome differed among these different cohorts, these findings nevertheless confirm the principle established at the phylum level in the initial longitudinal Uganda cohort that the translocation of particular microbial species—their diversity and composition—influences systemic inflammation and consequently CD4 T cell recovery in treated HIV infection.

Section: Discussion

We sought to explore the driving forces that underlie the resolution of inflammation and the recovery of CD4 T cell immunity under cART and to integrate them into a coherent model with a particular emphasis on the role of the microbiome. We used an unbiased systems biology approach in a cohort of HIV-infected Ugandans over a two-year period after the initiation of cART. We assessed plasma microbial nucleic acid fragments as a surrogate for components of the microbiome that translocate to the systemic circulation, as well as plasma cytokines, transcriptomes of immune cell subsets, and plasma metabolites.
Our initial principal finding was that increased levels of canonical pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 ( Kany et al., 2019 26. Kany, S. ∙ Vollrath, J.T. ∙ Relja, B. Cytokines in Inflammatory Disease Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20 :6008 Crossref Scopus (1122) PubMed Google Scholar ) correlated with greater CD4 T cell recovery at month 12 but with reduced CD4 T cell recovery at month 24. While this finding appears to challenge the generally accepted view that inflammation is uniformly detrimental for immune recovery in treated HIV disease, it suggests instead that a pro-inflammatory innate profile appears to be beneficial for immune recovery in the short term but undermines immune recovery in the long term. The surge in innate cytokines that we observed early after cART initiation was surprising. However, a precedent exists: immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an extreme manifestation of inflammation—characterized by high levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF elaborated in response to various microorganisms within the host—which occurs within weeks after cART initiation and points to mechanisms that might underlie the dramatic swings in cytokine levels we observed ( Sereti, 2020 50. Sereti, I. Immune reconstruction inflammatory syndrome in HIV infection: beyond what meets the eye Top. Antivir. Med. 2020; 27 :106-111 PubMed Google Scholar ). We emphasize that specific microbial nucleic acids detected in plasma likely reflect the ability of the immune system to control microbial translocation at mucosal surfaces, the largest of which being the gut. In the early post-cART phase, the initial increase in inflammation can be explained by transient changes in microbial diversity, with short bursts of innate immune responses giving way to counterbalancing regulatory responses, such as the increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, during the week 2 to month 4 period, which would contribute to a short-lived restoration of mucosal integrity and thus microbial diversity measured in plasma. At the same time, the increase in γ-chain cytokine responses (plasma IL-2 and IL-7 levels) from week 2 to month 4 that drive T cell proliferation would support the expected increase in CD4 T cell numbers at mucosal barriers. Putting all these changing factors together, an increase in mucosal CD4 T cells and an IL-10 response would both contribute to an improvement in microbial diversity which would peak at month 4.
This initial wave of responses, however, is not sufficient to adequately restore gut integrity, and a complex pattern of innate and adaptive immune responses ensues that ultimately (from month 9 onward) drives increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A, critical for maintenance of gut integrity. We observed that this increase in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cluster 1), IL-17, and Th17 gene signatures was associated with T cell reconstitution, reflected by higher CD4:CD8 T cell ratio, at 12 months. The high plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 observed after cART initiation, a likely consequence of an immune response to Serratia as suggested by our in vitro experiments ( Figure 3 E), are consistent with an increase in inflammatory hypoxic innate immune responses as suggested by upregulation of the HIF-1α pathway. We propose that high levels of IL-6 and IL-1β, a glycolytic microenvironment resulting from on-going hypoxic innate immune responses, accumulation of acylcarnitine long-chain fatty acids, and reduced mitochondrial function—all of which we measured when Serratia abundance was high—promote Th17 differentiation ( Dang et al., 2011 8. Dang, E.V. ∙ Barbi, J. ∙ Yang, H.Y. ... Control of T(H)17/T(reg) balance by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 Cell. 2011; 146 :772-784 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1243) PubMed Google Scholar ; ). Taken together, the presence of this Th17 response would ensure improved gut barrier integrity and regulate the microbiota and would be associated with the higher CD4:CD8 T cell ratio observed 12 months after treatment initiation.
At times when Serratia abundance was low, we observed that another Proteobacteria genus, Pseudomonas , as well as the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were abundant and associated with a Th1/Th2 cytokine profile. This particular pattern of microbial abundances and plasma cytokines, the opposite of that observed at 12 months, was associated with improved CD4 T cell recovery at the final 24-month time point. Integration of all our datasets shows that it is the relative abundances of different bacterial genera and phyla, specifically the ratio of Serratia to the others, which elicit concerted changes in cytokine profiles, innate and adaptive cellular differentiation, and metabolic states. These in turn affect the qualitative and quantitative features of immune reconstitution at different time points after cART initiation ( Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017 16. Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Kua, L. ... Mining the Human Gut Microbiota for Immunomodulatory Organisms Cell. 2017; 168 :928-943.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ).
These results led us to propose a model in which the initial pro-inflammatory immune response to Serratia results in robust Th17 differentiation as a result of IL-1β and IL-6 production and repair of the mucosal surfaces over the first year (see graphical abstract). Securing the integrity of the mucosal barrier through innate and Th17 immunity is of primary importance to the host in the short term. Once such restored immunity exerts control over the different microbial communities, their relative abundances shift to one that elicits a systemic cytokine and metabolic milieu that promotes Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation programs. Indeed, the downregulation of innate responses, which would be detrimental to the host if sustained, sets the stage for the next 12 months whereby restoration of systemic T cell homeostasis promotes further CD4 T cell reconstitution. Our data indicate that at 24 months, improved CD4 T cell reconstitution is associated with improved T cell survival and homeostasis, as evidenced by increased plasma IL-7 and TCF7 target gene expression. It makes biological sense that CD4 T cell regeneration after cART initiation is inflammation-driven, with eventual replacement by non-inflammatory homeostatic mechanisms as viral pathogenesis wanes with suppression of virus replication. Our findings highlight in detail how the overall composition of distinct genera or species of bacteria dictates the profile and kinetics of these inflammatory responses that in turn modulate CD4 T cell regeneration.
In conclusion, our study reveals the interactions between translocating microbial products and the host after the initiation of cART in HIV-infected people. These interactions govern the nature and tempo of T cell reconstitution, as well as the inflammatory status of the host, and therefore determine long-term clinical outcome. It is important to stress that an integrated and unbiased approach was required to deconvolute the complexities of the interplay between microbial components, innate and adaptive signals, and cellular metabolic and transcriptional profiles. Our findings highlight that perturbations in pro-inflammatory cytokines which have been previously identified as highly predictive of clinical outcome ( Hunt et al., 2016 24. Hunt, P.W. ∙ Lee, S.A. ∙ Siedner, M.J. Immunologic Biomarkers, Morbidity, and Mortality in Treated HIV Infection J. Infect. Dis. 2016; 214 :S44-S50 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hunt et al., 2014 23. Hunt, P.W. ∙ Sinclair, E. ∙ Rodriguez, B. ... Gut epithelial barrier dysfunction and innate immune activation predict mortality in treated HIV infection J. Infect. Dis. 2014; 210 :1228-1238 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tenorio et al., 2014 51. Tenorio, A.R. ∙ Zheng, Y. ∙ Bosch, R.J. ... Soluble markers of inflammation and coagulation but not T-cell activation predict non-AIDS-defining morbid events during suppressive antiretroviral treatment J. Infect. Dis. 2014; 210 :1248-1259 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ) are but one component of the systemic perturbations initiated by the fluctuating abundance of components derived from the microbiome, as we outline in Figures 5 and S5 . Furthermore, the longitudinal cohort also enabled us to identify the remarkably dynamic nature of these interactions over time. We believe the exact nature of these relationships will vary depending on multiple diverse factors such as environment, host genetics, nutrition, and the constituents of the microbiome. However, the principle of an intimate relationship between the translocated microbiome—its diversity and composition, systemic inflammation, and clinical outcome—can be generalized across different cohorts of HIV-infected people. Thus, our findings establish a rational framework for therapeutic intervention, targeting distinct components of the microbiome at different stages during cART to alter inflammatory profiles and cellular differentiation. Such an approach has the potential to change clinical practice during the short- and long-term treatment of the disease and thus mitigate morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected people.
Further in vitro experiments are needed to provide additional mechanistic insight into the effects of bacteria on immune cell function; however, such a system must recapitulate the complexity of the in vivo situation. While we defined bacteria by taxonomy and nomenclature, analysis based on functional genomics might yield a more coherent model and explain apparent inter-cohort differences in the relationship between detected microbial products and inflammatory profiles.

A total of 11 treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals were recruited at the Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC) in Kampala Uganda for a study assessing the impact of Integrase inhibition compared to non-nucleoside inhibition on HIV virus reservoirs in lymphoid tissues ( Rothenberger et al., 2019 46. Rothenberger, M. ∙ Nganou-Makamdop, K. ∙ Kityo, C. ... Impact of Integrase Inhibition Compared With Nonnucleoside Inhibition on HIV Reservoirs in Lymphoid Tissues J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2019; 81 :355-360 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). The institutional review boards of both the JCRC, the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) and the University of Minnesota approved all procedures. All participants had detectable plasma HIV viremia and no prior antiretroviral therapy (ART). Baseline characteristics of these individuals are detailed in Table 1 . Individuals were randomized to receive either EFV (600 mg/day) or RAL (400 mg/ twice daily) along with FTC (200 mg/day) plus TDF (300 mg/day). The different drug regimens showed no difference in viral decay between the RAL and EFV arms ( Rothenberger et al., 2019 46. Rothenberger, M. ∙ Nganou-Makamdop, K. ∙ Kityo, C. ... Impact of Integrase Inhibition Compared With Nonnucleoside Inhibition on HIV Reservoirs in Lymphoid Tissues J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2019; 81 :355-360 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 3 months of the assigned treatment, all subjects were switched to an open-label regimen according to the national protocol standard for Uganda at the time of the study (EFV plus either FTC + TDF or lamivudine (3TC) plus TDF) and they were followed up to 24 months after cART start. Combination ART was started at baseline with blood samples collected longitudinally. Treatment was well-tolerated and clinical record indicated that no subject was obviously unwell or showing any sign of infection at the time of blood collection. As per local custom, all participants received ampicillin and cloxacillin (250mg capsules) after sample collection at baseline and month 4 as surgical prophylaxis for lymph node biopsies collected for our previous study ( Rothenberger et al., 2019 46. Rothenberger, M. ∙ Nganou-Makamdop, K. ∙ Kityo, C. ... Impact of Integrase Inhibition Compared With Nonnucleoside Inhibition on HIV Reservoirs in Lymphoid Tissues J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2019; 81 :355-360 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Blood samples from healthy US donors were obtained on NIH IRB-approved protocol 99-CC-0168 and were de-identified prior to distribution. All study participants gave written informed consent.
Whole blood freshly collected in EDTA or ACD vacutainers tube (BD) was immediately processed by centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min for separation of plasma used directly for virus load measurement or frozen at −80°C for subsequent assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from ACD blood were isolated by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) and Leukosep Centrifuge Tubes (Grenier Bio-One) prior to cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. Plasma and cells were sampled at baseline and again at several time points after initiating cART (days 7 and 14, months 3, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 24).
HIV viral load was measured in plasma using the COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS TaqMan 96 (Roche) with a linearity range of 20-10,000,000 copies/mL or Abbott m2000 system platform with a linearity range of 40-10,000,000 copies/mL (respective lower limits of quantitation 20 and 40 copies/mL). The Abbott platform was used in the first 12 months of the study and the Roche for subsequent measures. Both platforms were registered on an external quality assurance program provided by the American Pathologists and Virology Quality Assurance from RUSH University Medical Center. Blood CD4 and CD8 T cells counts were measured by flow cytometry using FACSCount (Becton Dickinson).
For the longitudinal cohort, the LEGEND MAX ELISA kit was used to measure plasma levels of total TFGβ (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasma concentrations of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, G-CSF, IFNγ, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1β and TNF were measured by Bio-plex magnetic bead-based multiplex assays according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Plasma samples diluted 1:4 and standards were incubated with pre-mixed beads coated with capture antibodies for 30min on a plate shaker. After three wash steps, beads were then incubated with a capture antibody for 30min on a plate shaker. After three wash steps, beads were incubated with streptavidin-PE for 30min on a plate shaker. Lastly, beads were washed three times and resuspended in assay buffer and ran immediately on a MAGPIX instrument (Luminex corp.). Cytokine concentrations were inferred from the standards by the acquisition software. Plasma samples were run in two experiments with bridging samples between the experiments. A batch effect from separate experiments was excluded given similar results obtained from testing bridging and repeat samples between experiments. Plasma from HIV uninfected Ugandans collected in a prior study ( Kityo et al., 2018 27. Kityo, C. ∙ Makamdop, K.N. ∙ Rothenberger, M. ... Lymphoid tissue fibrosis is associated with impaired vaccine responses J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :2763-2773 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) was assayed in parallel.
Measurement of the concentration and composition of plasma metabolites was performed by Metabolon (Metabolon, Research Triangle Park). Samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR system from Hamilton Company in the presence of internal standards and proteins removed by methanol precipitation. The resulting extract was analyzed by reverse-phase Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) via both positive and negative mode electrospray as well as a HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI. The extracts where run on a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer.
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and washed in R10 media (RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine and 100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin) by centrifugation for 10min at 420 g . PBMC were labeled with stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Thermofisher) and the following antibodies: CD28Cy5PE, CD14-PE, CD3-Cy7APC, CD11c-APC, CD4-BV605 (BD); HLADR-Cy55PE (Invitrogen); CD45RO-ECD (Beckman Coulter); CD8-BV650, CD20-BV570 (Biolegend). Stained cells were washed in PBS by centrifugation for 10min at 420 g and subsequently sorted in R10 on an BD FACS Aria II into memory T cells, monocytes and mDC. Next, sorted cell subsets were pelleted by centrifugation for 10min at 420 g, 4°C. The cell pellets were then resuspended in RNAzol RT (MRC) and stored at −80°C for subsequent RNA extractions.
RNA was extracted from sorted cells lysed in RNAzol RT (MRC, OH, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 0.4 volume of sterile water was added to each lysate to allow aqueous and organic phase separation. Total RNA was then extracted from the aqueous phase by isopropanol precipitation. RNA pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in sterile water. Extracted RNA was stored at −80°C until preparation of mRNA libraries. RNA yield and integrity were verified by microelectrophoresis using the High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent) on the 2200 TapeStation system (Agilent). Next, mRNA libraries were constructed as described previously ( Sandler et al., 2014 49. Sandler, N.G. ∙ Bosinger, S.E. ∙ Estes, J.D. ... Type I interferon responses in rhesus macaques prevent SIV infection and slow disease progression Nature. 2014; 511 :601-605 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the NEBNext Ultra RNA library preparation kit. Polyadenylated transcripts were purified with oligo-dT magnetic beads, fragmented, reverse transcribed using random hexamers and incorporated into barcoded cDNA libraries based on the Illumina TruSeq platform. Libraries were validated by microelectrophoresis on a 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent), quantified with Kapa Library Quantification Kits (Roche), pooled and clustered on Illumina TruSeq v2 flow cells. Clustered flow cells were sequenced in 2x75 base paired-end runs on Illumina HiSeq 2000 and HiSeq 4000. Samples were processed in three independent cell sort and sequencing experiments (batches), and bridge samples were included between batches.
Circulating total RNA and DNA were isolated from frozen plasma using RNAzolBD (MRC) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After RNA fragmentation and reverse transcription using random hexamers, the obtained transcripts, as well as the isolated plasma DNA, were individually incorporated into barcoded cDNA libraries on the basis of the Illumina TruSeq platform. Libraries were validated by microelectrophoresis on a 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent), quantified using Kapa Library Quantification Kits (Roche), pooled and clustered on Illumina patterned flow cells. Clustered flow cells were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 in 75-base paired reads. To control for contamination, four water samples were processed along with plasma samples from nucleic acids extraction through sequencing.
Bacteroides fragilis (ATCC 25285) grown under anaerobic conditions in Difco Reinforced Clostridial Medium (BD biosciences) and Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 14917) grown aerobically in Difco Lactobacilli MRS Broth (BD biosciences) were counted using CountBright Absolute Counting Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Syto 9 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an LSR II instrument. Corynebacterium ihumii isolated from SIV-infected macaques was cultured in Brucella broth (Anaerobe Systems) and counted based on OD600 to CFU conversion. All cultured bacteria were stored as pellets at - 80°C. Pellets of Serratia marcescens (ATCC 14756) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442) were purchased from ATCC. All bacteria pellets were heat-killed by incubation for 45 min at 70°C prior to reconstitution in PBS for use in stimulation assays. For stimulation of PBMC from HIV-uninfected Ugandan and US donors, bacteria were added at a ratio of 2.5 bacteria per PBMC to 1 million PBMC and cells were cultured for 18 h at 37°C 5% CO2 in R10 media (RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine and 100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin). LPS from E. coli was taken along as stimulation control (Sigma O111:B4). Following stimulation, the supernatant was collected and immediately frozen at - 20°C for subsequent cytokine measurement. Supernatant concentrations of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IFNγ, MCP-1, MIP1β and TNF were measured by MesoScale Discovery electrochemiluminescence assay according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The plates were read on an MSD Sector Imager 2400 instrument. Of note, in vitro stimulation of cells from HIV uninfected Ugandans resulted in cytokine production barely above background; therefore, only responses from US donor PBMC were reported.
Plasma samples from three independent HIV cohorts with a total of 109 participant time points with known T cell counts were assessed in our study, of which 11 were paired pre- and post-cART. The second Ugandan cohort consisted of 7 HIV uninfected, 10 HIV-infected on cART and 3 paired HIV-infected off cART. The Montreal cohort ( Morou et al., 2019 35. Morou, A. ∙ Brunet-Ratnasingham, E. ∙ Dubé, M. ... Altered differentiation is central to HIV-specific CD4 + T cell dysfunction in progressive disease Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :1059-1070 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) consisted of 6 HIV uninfected and 28 HIV-infected, of which 5 were elite controllers, 3 viremic progressors of which 1 with a paired post-cART time point, 12 chronic progressors pre-cART of which 8 with paired post-cART time point. The Cleveland cohort ( Lederman et al., 2011 30. Lederman, M.M. ∙ Calabrese, L. ∙ Funderburg, N.T. ... Immunologic failure despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy is related to activation and turnover of memory CD4 cells J. Infect. Dis. 2011; 204 :1217-1226 Crossref Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar ) consisted of HIV-infected persons on cART, with 11 immune responders and 44 immune non-responders. Across cohorts, cART participant time points were 1-3 years post treatment initiation. Demographics of the validation cohorts are presented in Table S4 . Plasma cytokines concentrations were measured by MesoScale Discovery electrochemiluminescence assay according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The plates were read on Mesoscale Discovery’s MESO QuickPlex SQ 120.
The gap-statistic approach was used for the identification of cytokine clusters based on similarities in expression over time and defined as the between-clusters variance divided by the intra-cluster variance ( Tibshirani and Hastie, 2001 53. Tibshirani, R.W.G. ∙ Hastie, T. Estimating the number of clusters in a data set via the gap statistic J. R. Statist. Soc. 2001; 63 :411-423 Crossref Scopus (4079) Google Scholar ). The optimal number of clusters was defined as the smallest number of clusters (k) such that Gap(k) 3 Gap(k+1) – sd(k+1) and the greatest gap-statistic corresponding to the best fit. Peaks and valleys in the time series data were determined objectively using the ‘quantmod’ R-Bioconductor package. For each cytokine within a cluster, statistical significance of changes between time points was determined via the pairwise Wilcoxon test. The summarized trends of clusters with significant changes was calculated by the mean fold change relative to time points across markers in the same cluster.
An automated pipeline developed in-house that integrates online open-source tools for processing and analyzing RNA-Seq data was used to perform processing of the sequencing data, followed by downstream analysis using R-Bioconductor packages. Raw sequencing reads were trimmed off adaptor sequence contaminants using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 5. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (38307) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mapped onto the Refseq Grch38 of the human genome using the STAR RNA-Seq aligner ( Dobin et al., 2013 11. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene abundance was then estimated by counting using HTSeq. The obtained transcript counts were then normalized by TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values by correcting for the library size. Normalized data was then batch-corrected using the empirical Bayes framework implemented by ‘ComBat’ from the sva R-Bioconductor package. The corrected gene expression was used to determine differences in transcriptomic profiles between time points. This was determined by fitting a linear model to each gene, implemented in LIMMA ( Ritchie et al., 2015 43. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21698) PubMed Google Scholar ). The differences in transcriptomic profiles between the groups to be compared were determined by fitting a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for each gene, with the gene expression as a dependent variable and the duration on cART as an independent variable followed by a likelihood ratio test for the coefficients in the linear model, to test if fold changes are different from zero. These tests were conducted using the R-Bioconductor package edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 44. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26704) PubMed Google Scholar ). The P -values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin and Hochberg (BH) method. Pathway enrichment among the genes differentially expressed between time points at an adjusted p < 0.05, was performed using the Fisher’s exact test using the Hallmark gene sets, C7 gene sets that included the Th1, Th2 and Th17 signatures from the Molecular Signatures DataBase version 6.2 (MSigDB - ( Liberzon et al., 2015 31. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6393) PubMed Google Scholar )), Th17 signature genes extracted from peer-reviewed sources ( Ciofani et al., 2012 7. Ciofani, M. ∙ Madar, A. ∙ Galan, C. ... A validated regulatory network for Th17 cell specification Cell. 2012; 151 :289-303 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (901) PubMed Google Scholar ), monocyte subset signatures ( Wong et al., 2011 57. Wong, K.L. ∙ Tai, J.J. ∙ Wong, W.C. ... Gene expression profiling reveals the defining features of the classical, intermediate, and nonclassical human monocyte subsets Blood. 2011; 118 :e16-e31 Crossref Scopus (789) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the Small Molecular Pathways DataBase (SMPDB) for metabolic pathways ( Frolkis et al., 2010 15. Frolkis, A. ∙ Knox, C. ∙ Lim, E. ... SMPDB: The Small Molecule Pathway Database Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :D480-D487 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). The P -values of the enriched pathways were corrected for multiple comparisons using the BH method and pathways or gene sets enriched at p < 0.05 were reported. For every gene set/pathway significantly enriched, the z-score of the gene set/pathway per sample was calculated using Sample Level Enrichment Analysis (SLEA -( Gundem and Lopez-Bigas, 2012 18. Gundem, G. ∙ Lopez-Bigas, N. Sample-level enrichment analysis unravels shared stress phenotypes among multiple cancer types Genome Med. 2012; 4 :28 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar )), where the mean expression value of genes of the enriched gene set was compared to the mean expression of 1000 random gene sets of the same size as the selected gene set for every sample. The difference between the observed and expected mean expression values for each gene set was calculated. The SLEA z-score of the gene sets was correlated (spearman’s test) with the cytokine cluster expression, Serratia ratio and the plasma metabolites in order to assess the significance (at P -value < 5%) of association between transcriptional signatures and the outcomes.
The frequencies of classical, non-classical and intermediate monocyte frequencies were obtained through in-silico deconvolution of the sorted monocyte transcriptomic data using the CIBERSORT approach ( Newman et al., 2015 37. Newman, A.M. ∙ Liu, C.L. ∙ Green, M.R. ... Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :453-457 Crossref Scopus (7546) PubMed Google Scholar ). A reference dataset of well-defined classical, non-classical, and intermediate gene signatures ( Wong et al., 2011 57. Wong, K.L. ∙ Tai, J.J. ∙ Wong, W.C. ... Gene expression profiling reveals the defining features of the classical, intermediate, and nonclassical human monocyte subsets Blood. 2011; 118 :e16-e31 Crossref Scopus (789) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for the deconvolution.
A projection-based approach using the mixOmics approach ( Rohart et al., 2017 45. Rohart, F. ∙ Gautier, B. ∙ Singh, A. ... mixOmics: An R package for 'omics feature selection and multiple data integration PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13 :e1005752 Crossref Scopus (1969) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to assess the correlation between the abundance of the circulating microbial nucleic acids and the plasma cytokines. In order to minimize the technical effect specific to each data type, a sparse-least square regression was used to generate a unique scale for each data type and to project all data types on the same scale allowing to assess correlation. The Pearson correlation between the features of the two data types and a P -value based on the distribution of the correlation coefficients were calculated. Pearson correlations below a P -value cutoff of 0.05 were considered significant. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was applied via the lars package in R, to select best set of plasma microbial and cytokine predictors. The models were optimized using leave-one-out cross validation and the model with the least cross-validated mean square error (MSE) was selected.
Our deep sequencing approach circumvents the issue that circulating nucleic acids in plasma are subject to fragmentation ( El-Hefnawy et al., 2004 13. El-Hefnawy, T. ∙ Raja, S. ∙ Kelly, L. ... Characterization of amplifiable, circulating RNA in plasma and its potential as a tool for cancer diagnostics Clin. Chem. 2004; 50 :564-573 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), which renders approaches such as PCR that rely on specific contiguous sequences unreliable to capture the full extent of microbial burden. The frequency of non-human sequencing reads compared to total reads is usually about 8%–10% and allows identification of microbial sequences. To this end, raw, paired-end Illumina reads were first trimmed for low-quality bases and adaptor contamination with Trimmomatic. As a first pass to remove host-derived sequences, trimmed reads were first aligned against the HG38 genome with Bowtie 2 and then aligned to HG38 transcriptome with the splice aware aligner, STAR. On average, 92% of the reads aligned to the HG38 reference genome and transcriptome with the remaining reads being of potential non-human origin. Unaligned paired-end reads were then assembled into contigs using Trinity. Trinity contigs were then aligned against HG38 again to further remove host-derived sequences with BLAST+. In addition, Trinity contigs that aligned to non-reference human sequences in the NCBI nucleotide database were also removed. Remaining contigs were then aligned against the NCBI nucleotide database and quantified with Salmon. Taxonomic information was assigned for each contig and transcripts per million (TPM) values were collapsed at the species level for each sample. TPM are normalized for sequencing read depth and length for each sample, allowing for a more accurate comparisons between proportion of reads mapping to the same gene in various samples. In our analysis, TPMs (reflect normalized abundances refereed on figures as “abundances”) are further used to calculate proportions within a sample (referred on figures as “relative abundance”). Sequencing of RNA and DNA fractions along with water controls resulted in identification of 1235 and 1476 species respectively, with 75%–80% identified in plasma samples but not in water controls ( Figure S7 A). For species identified in both plasma samples and water controls, the abundance (TPM) was in average 3.5-fold (for DNA) and 8-fold (for RNA) higher in plasma samples compared to water controls ( Figure S7 B), a pattern consistently seen for the four most abundant bacterial phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria ( Figure S7 C). Moreover, water TPM values represented 7.5% (for RNA) and 13.5% (for DNA) of the maximum TPM among the plasma samples for species identified in plasma samples. For each sample, TPM values from water controls were subtracted from the samples for each species. Following subtraction of water controls, combined RNA and DNA TPM values were then used to estimate relative abundance at phylum and genus level. The samples were processed in three independent experiments (batches), and a few bridge samples were included between batches. Batch correction was performed on TPM values using the empirical Bayes framework implemented by ‘ComBat’ from the ‘sva’ R-Bioconductor package. NCBI taxonomy database was applied via the ‘phyloT v2: a phylogenetic tree generator’ web-interface ( https://phylot.biobyte.de/ ) to generate newick taxonomy tree files. These tree files were visualized and annotated with genera abundance statistics using the interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) ( https://itol.embl.de/ ) web-interface. For the analysis of the composition of microbial nucleic acids measured, alpha diversity and beta diversity were calculated. The alpha diversity, which reflects species diversity, was calculated by the Shannon diversity index and statistical significance of changes in Shannon diversity overtime was assessed using a paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Bray-Curtis distance was used to assess similarity of beta diversity following hierarchical clustering between time points.
Plasma microbial nucleic acids were measured as stated above. To conduct a more detailed evaluation of the composition of the translocated microbiome in our independent cohorts, we further analyzed all bacterial genera that were detected in > 50% of study participants in at least one of the 10 subgroups of individuals (elite and viremic controllers, pre- and post-cART, IR and INR and HIV-uninfected individuals; see Table S5 for the list of selected genera. NCBI taxonomy of 71 genera that resulted from this filtering was mapped using phyloT web interface ( https://phylot.biobyte.de/ ) and visualized using the iToL ( https://itol.embl.de/ ). 15 genera were detectable (median abundance > 0 TPM) between geographically distinct groups of HIV-uninfected individuals from Uganda and Montreal. Six of the 15 genera were from the Firmicute and Actinobacteria phyla and included the common genera Staphylococcus , Streptococcus and Micrococcus ( Table S5 ). The remaining nine genera from the phylum Proteobacteria included genera (such as Acinetobacter , Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas ) that were identified in the longitudinal Ugandan cohort ( Figure 3 A) and were detected in individuals across several geographically distinct HIV-infected subgroups ( Table S5 ).
