Title: Structure of a Hallucinogen-Activated Gq-Coupled 5-HT 2A Serotonin Receptor


Abstract: Summary

Hallucinogens like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and substituted N -benzyl phenylalkylamines are widely used recreationally with psilocybin being considered as a therapeutic for many neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. How psychedelics mediate their actions—both therapeutic and hallucinogenic—are not understood, although activation of the 5-HT 2A serotonin receptor (HTR2A) is key. To gain molecular insights into psychedelic actions, we determined the active-state structure of HTR2A bound to 25-CN-NBOH—a prototypical hallucinogen—in complex with an engineered Gαq heterotrimer by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We also obtained the X-ray crystal structures of HTR2A complexed with the arrestin-biased ligand LSD or the inverse agonist methiothepin. Comparisons of these structures reveal determinants responsible for HTR2A-Gαq protein interactions as well as the conformational rearrangements involved in active-state transitions. Given the potential therapeutic actions of hallucinogens, these findings could accelerate the discovery of more selective drugs for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Section: Introduction

Naturally occurring psychedelics from plants as diverse as the mescaline-containing cactus Lophophora williamsii , the psilocybin-containing mushrooms Psilocybe sp ., and the lysergamide-containing seeds from “Morning Glories” ( Ipomoea sp .) have been reportedly used for millennia for religious purposes and shamanism ( Nichols, 2016 52. Nichols, D.E. Psychedelics Pharmacol. Rev. 2016; 68 :264-355 Crossref Scopus (980) PubMed Google Scholar ). Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, semi-synthetic hallucinogens like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and synthetic hallucinogens related to mescaline, including substituted amphetamines such as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine ( Snyder et al., 1968 70. Snyder, S.H. ∙ Faillace, L.A. ∙ Weingartner, H. DOM (STP), a new hallucinogenic drug, and DOET: effects in normal subjects Am. J. Psychiatry. 1968; 125 :113-120 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), were available and used recreationally. More recently so-called “designer hallucinogens” with a scaffold related to N -benzyl-2,5-dimethoxy-phenethylamine (NBOMe) ( Figure 1 A) have become popular ( Poulie et al., 2019 58. Poulie, C.B.M. ∙ Jensen, A.A. ∙ Halberstadt, A.L. ... DARK Classics in Chemical Neuroscience: NBOMes. ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2019; Published online November 12, 2019 Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar ) albeit with scattered reports of toxicity ( Halberstadt, 2017 24. Halberstadt, A.L. Pharmacology and Toxicology of N-Benzylphenethylamine (“NBOMe”) Hallucinogens Curr. Top. Behav. Neurosci. 2017; 32 :283-311 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of the NBOMe series, 25CN-NBOH is reported to be among the most potent and selective in vitro and in vivo ( Fantegrossi et al., 2015 17. Fantegrossi, W.E. ∙ Gray, B.W. ∙ Bailey, J.M. ...

Neurosci. 2014; 5 :243-249 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Hallucinogens like psilocybin and LSD have been described to have potential therapeutic actions for many neuropsychiatric diseases ( Nutt et al., 2020 53. Nutt, D. ∙ Erritzoe, D. ∙ Carhart-Harris, R. Psychedelic Psychiatry’s Brave New World Cell. 2020; 181 :24-28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Psilocybin, for instance, has shown efficacy in two phase II clinical trials of depression and anxiety ( Carhart-Harris et al., 2018 9. Carhart-Harris, R.L. ∙ Bolstridge, M. ∙ Day, C.M.J. ... Psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression: six-month follow-up Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2018; 235 :399-408 Crossref Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ross et al., 2016 62.

(Oxford). 2016; 30 :1165-1180 Crossref Scopus (947) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, psilocybin’s effects appear to be both rapid and enduring ( Carhart-Harris et al., 2018 9. Carhart-Harris, R.L. ∙ Bolstridge, M. ∙ Day, C.M.J. ...

(Oxford). 2016; 30 :1181-1197 Crossref Scopus (1163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, LSD has been reported in pilot studies to have efficacy in cluster headaches ( Sewell et al., 2006 66. Sewell, R.A. ∙ Halpern, J.H. ∙ Pope, Jr., H.G. Response of cluster headache to psilocybin and LSD Neurology. 2006; 66 :1920-1922 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), to alleviate anxiety in terminal illness ( Gasser et al., 2015 21. Gasser, P. ∙ Kirchner, K. ∙ Passie, T. LSD-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associated with a life-threatening disease: a qualitative study of acute and sustained subjective effects J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2015; 29 :57-68 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a number of uncontrolled and anecdotal reports have suggested its therapeutic actions in other neuropsychiatric disorders ( Dos Santos et al., 2018 13.

Psychedelic Psychiatry’s Brave New World Cell. 2020; 181 :24-28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although the precise mechanisms of action of hallucinogens remain largely unclear, 5-HT 2A serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor agonism is essential for their psychedelic effects in humans ( Barrett et al., 2018 4. Barrett, F.S. ∙ Preller, K.H. ∙ Herdener, M. ... Serotonin 2A Receptor Signaling Underlies LSD-induced Alteration of the Neural Response to Dynamic Changes in Music Cereb.

Changes in global and thalamic brain connectivity in LSD-induced altered states of consciousness are attributable to the 5-HT2A receptor eLife. 2018; 7 :e35082 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nutt et al., 2020 53. Nutt, D. ∙ Erritzoe, D. ∙ Carhart-Harris, R. Psychedelic Psychiatry’s Brave New World Cell. 2020; 181 :24-28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). The key to an understanding of psychedelic actions, then, is an appreciation of how they interact with and activate 5-HT 2A serotonin receptors (HTR2A). To elucidate hallucinogen actions at the molecular level, we report here the active-state structure of 5-HT 2A bound to 25CN-NBOH in complex with a mini-Gαq-βγ heterotrimer stabilized by a single-chain variable fragment (scFv16) obtained by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). For comparison, we also report X-ray structures of HTR2A complexed with the prototypical hallucinogen LSD and the inverse agonist methiothepin. Collectively, these results provide insights into how a model hallucinogen stabilizes a specific HTR2A transducer-coupled state. These findings should accelerate structure-guided efforts for discovering more selective HTR2A agonists with potential therapeutic activity for many neuropsychiatric diseases.

Section: Results

For structural studies with a transducer-coupled HTR2A, we initially evaluated the HTR2A non-selective hallucinogen LSD ( Kroeze et al., 2015 38. Kroeze, W.K. ∙ Sassano, M.F. ∙ Huang, X.P. ... PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :362-369 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the HTR2A-selective agonist 25CN-NBOH ( Fantegrossi et al., 2015 17. Fantegrossi, W.E. ∙ Gray, B.W. ∙ Bailey, J.M. ... Hallucinogen-like effects of 2-([2-(4-cyano-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl) ethylamino]methyl)phenol (25CN-NBOH), a novel N-benzylphenethylamine with 100-fold selectivity for 5-HT 2 A receptors, in mice Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2015; 232 :1039-1047 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hansen et al., 2014 26. Hansen, M. ∙ Phonekeo, K. ∙ Paine, J.S. ... Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of N-benzyl phenethylamines as 5-HT2A/2C agonists ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2014; 5 :243-249 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). In preliminary experiments, we found that 25CN-NBOH provided more effective stabilization of the final complex than LSD (not shown). We used an engineered Gαq that was previously demonstrated to faithfully recapitulate wild-type Gαq-coupled G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation for several GPCRs, including HTR2A ( Nehmé et al., 2017 51. Nehmé, R. ∙ Carpenter, B. ∙ Singhal, A. ... Mini-G proteins: Novel tools for studying GPCRs in their active conformation PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0175642 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wan et al., 2018 79. Wan, Q. ∙ Okashah, N. ∙ Inoue, A. ... Mini G protein probes for active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in live cells J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :7466-7473 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, 35 amino acids at the N terminus of engineered mini-Gαq were replaced by the corresponding sequence in Gαi2 to facilitate binding of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv16) ( Maeda et al., 2018 41. Maeda, S. ∙ Koehl, A. ∙ Matile, H. ... Development of an antibody fragment that stabilizes GPCR/G-protein complexes Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3712 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), thereby further stabilizing the HTR2A-Gαq protein complex for structural studies ( Figure S1 ). An analogous approach was recently used to obtain a structure of the M1-muscarinic receptor complexed with Gα11 ( Maeda et al., 2019 42. Maeda, S. ∙ Qu, Q. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes Science. 2019; 364 :552-557 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). To verify the functionality of the complex we performed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET 1 and 2) (see Olsen et al., 2020 54. Olsen, R.H.J. ∙ DiBerto, J.F. ∙ English, J.G. ... TRUPATH, an open-source biosensor platform for interrogating the GPCR transducerome Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16 :841-849 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar for details) ( Figure 1 D) studies similar to those previously reported ( Wan et al., 2018 79. Wan, Q. ∙ Okashah, N. ∙ Inoue, A. ... Mini G protein probes for active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in live cells J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :7466-7473 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ), which revealed that the functional activity of this engineered mini-Gαq construct is comparable to the wild-type Gαq ( Figure 1 E; Table S4 ). The studies also showed that 25CN-NBOH was the most efficacious agonist tested in our Gαq BRET recruitment assays ( Figure 1 F; Table S4 ).
To improve the expression of HTR2A, parts of the N- and C-terminal of HTR2A were truncated and then cloned into a pFASTBac 1 vector ( Figure S1 A). To obtain a stable complex of HTR2A-Gαq, the sequences of the engineered Gαq iN , Gβ1, and Gγ2 were integrated into a pFast dual expression vector to afford simultaneous expression of all three components and pre-formation of the Gαq iN -Gβ1-Gγ2 heterotrimer ( Figure S1 B). We expressed HTR2A and G protein complex (Gαq iN -Gβ1-Gγ2) in sf9 insect cells and purified them individually. The full complex of HTR2A-Gαq iN -Gβ1-Gγ2 was then assembled in the presence of the agonist 25CN-NBOH and further stabilized by the single-chain antibody scFv16 ( Figures S1 C and S1D). The structure of G protein-coupled HTR2A complexed with 25CN-NBOH was determined by single-particle cryo-EM at a global nominal resolution of 3.27 Å, enabling near-atomic resolution modeling of the complex ( Figures 1 A and S1 ; Table S1 ). The 25CN-NBOH pose was further confirmed and validated through the GemSpot pipeline ( Robertson et al., 2020 61. Robertson, M.J. ∙ van Zundert, G.C.P. ∙ Borrelli, K. ... GemSpot: A Pipeline for Robust Modeling of Ligands into Cryo-EM Maps Structure. 2020; 28 :707-716 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) and was virtually identical to the pose predicted by independent molecular docking studies ( Figures S6 E and S6F). The overall structure of 25CN-NBOH-stabilized HTR2A-Gαq/β1/γ2 structure is consistent with the fully active-state receptor conformation that has been observed in several other GPCRs bound to a G-protein ternary complex ( Weis and Kobilka, 2018 81. Weis, W.I. ∙ Kobilka, B.K. The Molecular Basis of G Protein-Coupled Receptor Activation Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :897-919 Crossref Scopus (683) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that scFv16 binds to the crevice between the αN helix of mini-Gαq iN and the β-propeller of Gβ1 similar to that observed in the MOR-Gαi complex ( Koehl et al., 2018 34. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the µ-opioid receptor-G i protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ), thereby providing additional stabilization of the complex ( Figure S1 E).
To obtain a more thorough understanding of how hallucinogens might interact with HTR2A, we determined crystal structures of two HTR2A-ligand complexes. LSD is the prototypical hallucinogen that exerts effects its psychedelic primarily via HTR2A ( Nichols, 2016 52. Nichols, D.E. Psychedelics Pharmacol. Rev. 2016; 68 :264-355 Crossref Scopus (980) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we previously reported the structure of the 5-HT2B (HTR2B) receptor complexed with LSD ( Wacker et al., 2017b 78. Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ McCorvy, J.D. ... Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor Cell. 2017; 168 :377-389 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ) and related ergolines ( McCorvy et al., 2018 44. McCorvy, J.D. ∙ Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ... Structural determinants of 5-HT 2B receptor activation and biased agonism Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :787-796 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). These structures provided important insights into mechanisms of biased agonism at HTR2B ( McCorvy et al., 2018 44. McCorvy, J.D. ∙ Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ... Structural determinants of 5-HT 2B receptor activation and biased agonism Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :787-796 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roth, 2019 63. Roth, B.L. Molecular pharmacology of metabotropic receptors targeted by neuropsychiatric drugs Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :535-544 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) and hints regarding how LSD might interact with HTR2A ( Wacker et al., 2017b 78. Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ McCorvy, J.D. ... Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor Cell. 2017; 168 :377-389 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). To obtain a better understanding of the actions of LSD on HTR2A, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of HTR2A complexed with LSD ( Figure 1 B), and, for comparison, the potent inverse agonist methiothepin ( Figure 1 C; Table S2 ). Both structures were obtained at 3.4 Å resolution using an identical HTR2A construct with apocytochrome b562RIL (BRIL) fused to the third intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) of the receptor and two thermostabilizing HTR2A mutations (L247A 5.51 and L371A 7.44 ) ( Figures S2 A–S2D). Binding assays showed that this engineered construct maintained WT ligand-binding affinities ( Figure S2 E). The asymmetric unit (ASU) contains three molecules, and crystal contacts are mediated by TM1, TM4, and H8 ( Figure S2 F). The superposition of these three molecules shows that the orientation of the receptors is nearly identical, although slight differences are observed in the BRIL fusion protein. We focused on HTR2A molecule “chain A” for subsequent analysis ( Figure S2 G).
The electron density maps for LSD and methiothepin were well resolved ( Figure S2 H). The overall differences between LSD bound to HTR2A and the previous LSD-HTR2B structure are relatively subtle, as predicted ( Wacker et al., 2017b 78. Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ McCorvy, J.D. ... Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor Cell. 2017; 168 :377-389 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the HTR2B/LSD structure, ECL2 forms a “lid” over LSD, prolonging LSD’s residence time ( Wacker et al., 2017b 78. Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ McCorvy, J.D. ... Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor Cell. 2017; 168 :377-389 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). In confirmation of our prior mutagenesis, kinetic, and molecular modeling studies ( Wacker et al., 2017b 78. Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ McCorvy, J.D. ... Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor Cell. 2017; 168 :377-389 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ), we find that ECL2 in the LSD-HTR2A complex is located in a similar position, occluding LSD ( Figure 2 A). Using a previously described constitutively active HTR2A mutant ( Shapiro et al., 2002 67. Shapiro, D.A. ∙ Kristiansen, K. ∙ Weiner, D.M. ... Evidence for a model of agonist-induced activation of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors which involves the disruption of a strong ionic interaction between helices 3 and 6 J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :11441-11449 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that methiothepin (a non-selective serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptor antagonist) was a potent and efficacious HTR2A inverse agonist ( Figure S2 I). Methiothepin’s binding pose in HTR2A displays unique features that are detailed below.
With these available structures in hand, we first assessed the overall conformational rearrangements between the inactive and active state structures. A surface view from the extracellular side also shows that the Gαq-coupled state is considerably more open than the LSD-bound state ( Figures 2 A–2C). We calculated the size of the ligand-binding pockets for all three structures using the CASTp 3.0 server ( Tian et al., 2018 75. Tian, W. ∙ Chen, C. ∙ Lei, X. ... CASTp 3.0: computed atlas of surface topography of proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W363-W367 Crossref Scopus (1369) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that the solvent-accessible volumes of the ligand-binding pockets were 188.1 A 3 for methiothepin, 153.1 A 3 for LSD, and 287.0 A 3 for 25CN-NBOH ( Figure 2 D; Table S3 ). Typically, based on analysis of other class A active-state GPCR/G protein complex structures (e.g., β2-adrenergic/Gαs [ Rasmussen et al., 2011 60. Rasmussen, S.G. ∙ DeVree, B.T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex Nature. 2011; 477 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (2475) PubMed Google Scholar ], M1-muscarininc/Gα11 and M2-muscarinic/Go [ Maeda et al., 2019 42.

Che, T. ∙ Majumdar, S. ∙ Zaidi, S.A. ... Structure of the Nanobody-Stabilized Active State of the Kappa Opioid Receptor Cell. 2018; 172 :55-67 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ]), receptor activation leads to a contraction of the extracellular binding pocket and expansion of the intracellular end, thereby providing space for the engagement of transducers (e.g., G proteins or arrestins). Conceivably, the observed expansion of the ligand-binding pocket in the 25CN-NBOH-bound complex is ligand-specific, coinciding with its unique binding pose compared to LSD and methiothepin, although additional Gαq-coupled structures will be needed to test this hypothesis.
In the cryo-EM map, the density of the ligand 25CN-NBOH, the transmembrane domains, and the G protein binding interface are all well resolved, thus allowing us to examine conformational changes upon agonist binding and transducer coupling ( Figures S3 A–S3D). Consistent with previous G protein- and arrestin-complexed GPCR structures ( Lee et al., 2020 39. Lee, Y. ∙ Warne, T. ∙ Nehme, R. ...

Structure of the M2 muscarinic receptor-β-arrestin complex in a lipid nanodisc Nature. 2020; 579 :297-302 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ), the intracellular ends of TM5 and TM6 in HTR2A-Gαq complex undergo the largest displacement and are tilted outward by 4.3 Å (Cα of A265 5.69 ) and 7.1 Å (Cα of I315 6.27 ), respectively, while TM7 in the HTR2A-Gαq complex is shifted inward by 2.0 Å (Cα of F383 7.56 ) ( Figure S4 A). It is noteworthy that the structure of the muscarinic receptor M1 bound to Gα11, which is also a Gαq family subtype, shows an outward movement of TM6 by 8 Å ( Maeda et al., 2019 42. Maeda, S. ∙ Qu, Q. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes Science. 2019; 364 :552-557 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ) that displays a slightly different tilt of the α5 helix of G11.
Because of the stabilization provided by Gαq coupling, the overall structure of HTR2A resides in a rigid conformation, and ICL2 now displays helical turns reminiscent of that predicted by computational studies ( Perez-Aguilar et al., 2014 56. Perez-Aguilar, J.M. ∙ Shan, J. ∙ LeVine, M.V. ... A functional selectivity mechanism at the serotonin-2A GPCR involves ligand-dependent conformations of intracellular loop 2 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136 :16044-16054 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) that are not resolved in the inactive structures ( Figure S4 B). Other features related to receptor activation were observed in conserved motifs including (1) an inward shift of residues in NPXXY motif, (2) breaking of the ionic lock between R173 3.50 and E318 6.30 ( Shapiro et al., 2002 67. Shapiro, D.A. ∙ Kristiansen, K. ∙ Weiner, D.M. ... Evidence for a model of agonist-induced activation of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors which involves the disruption of a strong ionic interaction between helices 3 and 6 J. Biol.

Although these residues or motifs have been implicated in playing important roles in receptor activation and signaling transduction, the initiation and sequence of these events are still understudied.
We next examined the ligand-binding pocket of the three structures as they represent unique subfamilies (25CN-NBOH as an N -benzyl phenethylamine full-agonist, LSD is an ergoline arrestin-biased partial agonist, and methiothepin is an inverse agonist). Conserved interactions observed in all three structures reveal a shared mechanism for HTR2A binding ( Figures 3 A–3C). A salt bridge is observed between D155 3.32 and a positively charged nitrogen in each ligand, which is a critical interaction for ligand binding in serotonin and other monoamine receptors ( Kristiansen et al., 2000 37. Kristiansen, K. ∙ Kroeze, W.K. ∙ Willins, D.L. ... A highly conserved aspartic acid (Asp-155) anchors the terminal amine moiety of tryptamines and is involved in membrane targeting of the 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptor but does not participate in activation via a “salt-bridge disruption” mechanism J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293 :735-746 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Not surprisingly, mutation of D155 3.32 leads to the loss of function for almost all HTR2A ligands ( Figure 3 D). Other hydrophobic interactions have also been observed in all three liganded structures, such as V156 3.33 , V235 5.39 , and, as predicted previously ( Roth et al., 1997 64. Roth, B.L. ∙ Shoham, M. ∙ Choudhary, M.S. ... Identification of conserved aromatic residues essential for agonist binding and second messenger production at 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptors Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52 :259-266 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ), W336 6.48 , F339 6.51 , and F340 6.52 ( Figures 3 A–3C). Mutagenesis and functional experiments suggested that many of these residues are essential for ligand binding and subsequent receptor activation ( Figures 3 D, S5 A, and SB; Table S5 and Table S6 ).
Quite recently, inactive-state structures of HTR2A bound to risperidone or zotepine were reported ( Kimura et al., 2019 33. Kimura, K.T. ∙ Asada, H. ∙ Inoue, A. ... Structures of the 5-HT 2A receptor in complex with the antipsychotics risperidone and zotepine Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :121-128 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, a total of five ligand-HTR2A complexes were examined (risperidone and zotepine [ Kimura et al., 2019 33. Kimura, K.T. ∙ Asada, H. ∙ Inoue, A. ... Structures of the 5-HT 2A receptor in complex with the antipsychotics risperidone and zotepine Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :121-128 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ], LSD, 25CN-NBOH, and methiothepin here), thereby providing the opportunity to examine ligand-specific features related to binding. Alignment of all five ligand-complexed HTR2A structures shows that the HTR2A-selective agonist 25CN-NBOH displays a unique binding pose compared with the non-selective partial agonist LSD and the non-selective inverse agonists methiothepin, risperidone, and zotepine ( Figure 4 A). We note that these following comparisons represent a single active state with four mainly inactive state structures. It will be important going forward to obtain more active-state HTR2A structures to determine if the binding pose of 25CN-NBOH is unique. The 2-hydroxyphenyl moiety of 25CN-NBOH dives deep down into a previously undescribed pocket between TM3 and TM6, forming hydrophobic interactions with the indole ring of W336 6.48 ( Figure 4 B). For many years, this highly conserved W 6.48 in class A GPCRs has been proposed as a “toggle-switch” to control GPCRs transitioning between “on” and “off” states during signaling transduction ( Shi et al., 2002 69. Shi, L. ∙ Liapakis, G. ∙ Xu, R. ... Beta2 adrenergic receptor activation. Modulation of the proline kink in transmembrane 6 by a rotamer toggle switch J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :40989-40996 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ). The close interaction between 25CN-NBOH and W336 6.48 coincides with a large displacement of the side chain of W336 6.48 , acting as a pivot for the outward movement of TM6 ( Figure 4 C). This displacement of W336 6.48 is accompanied by a movement of F332 6.44 that is part of the conserved P 5.50 -I 3.40 -F 6.44 motif ( Figure 4 D) ( Wacker et al., 2017a 77. Wacker, D. ∙ Stevens, R.C. ∙ Roth, B.L. How Ligands Illuminate GPCR Molecular Pharmacology Cell. 2017; 170 :414-427 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (398) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both W 6.48 and the P 5.50 -I 3.40 -F 6.44 motif have been shown to undergo conformational changes upon receptor activation ( Wacker et al., 2013 76. Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Katritch, V. ... Structural features for functional selectivity at serotonin receptors Science. 2013; 340 :615-619 Crossref Scopus (582) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, the dynamic coupling between W 6.48 and the P 5.50 -I 3.40 -F 6.44 motif may partially explain how allosteric changes are transmitted in the active state similar to what was observed in the cryo-EM structure of the CB1 cannabinoid-Gi in complex with fubinaca ( Krishna Kumar et al., 2019 36. Krishna Kumar, K. ∙ Shalev-Benami, M. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of a Signaling Cannabinoid Receptor 1-G Protein Complex Cell. 2019; 176 :448-458 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). A comparison of all available serotonin-receptor structures, including active and inactive, reveals that the displacement of W336 6.48 of HTR2A is also greater than those observed in other structures ( Figure S5 C) ( García-Nafría et al., 2018 20. García-Nafría, J. ∙ Nehmé, R. ∙ Edwards, P.C. ...

Yin, W. ∙ Zhou, X.E. ∙ Yang, D. ... Crystal structure of the human 5-HT 1B serotonin receptor bound to an inverse agonist Cell Discov. 2018; 4 :12 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to an edge-to-face π–π interaction with W336 6.48 , the 2-OH of 25-CN-NBOH is the only observed ligand to form a hydrogen bond with S159 3.36 , and this results in a 2.9 Å side-chain movement. As anticipated, the S159A 3.36 mutation dramatically attenuated 25CN-NBOH’s agonist potency ( Figure S5 B). The 2-hydroxyphenyl moiety is also accommodated by the conserved G369 7.42 which moves “in” upon agonist binding to form hydrophobic interactions. Slightly increasing the size of the side chain through mutation G369A 7.42 dramatically attenuated 25CN-NBOH’s agonist potency ( Figure S5 B; Table S5 and Table S6 ). However, the binding affinity of G369A 7.42 does not significantly change compared to the wild-type Figure S5 A and Table S6 ), indicating that this residue may play a role in signal transduction in HTR2A. These interactions, as will be shown below, are not observed in either the LSD- or methiothepin-bound structures.
Given that LSD and methiothepin are non-selective HTR ligands, the observed binding pose between 25CN-NBOH and HTR2A could contribute to the selectivity of 25CN-NBOH at 5HTR2A over many other biogenic amine receptors ( Figures S5 D and S6 ). As reported ( Halberstadt et al., 2016 25. Halberstadt, A.L. ∙ Sindhunata, I.S. ∙ Scheffers, K. ... Effect of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors on temporal discrimination by mice Neuropharmacology. 2016; 107 :364-375 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) and summarized ( Figure S6 A), 25CN-NBOH has negligible affinity for all other human biogenic amine receptors while preferring HTR2A over HTR2C and HTR2B ( Figure S5 A). An alignment of binding site residues among biogenic amine receptors discloses that G238 5.42 is replaced by Ser 5.42 or Thr 5.42 in most other biogenic amine receptors ( Figure S6 A). As predicted from this alignment, a G238 5.42 S mutation diminished 25CN-NBOH’s agonist potency ( Figure S6 B), and this likely represents one of the structural determinants essential for 25CN-NBOH’s selective pharmacology.
Although the phenethylamine group of 25CN-NBOH is located in the orthosteric pocket similar to LSD and other antagonists, 25CN-NBOH does not, like LSD, have substantial interactions with the conserved serines S239 5.43 and S242 5.46 . In particular, S242 5.46 is unique to HTR2A among the serotonin family ( Figure 4 E). A comparison of LSD-bound HTR2A with HTR2B structures shows that the overall orientation of LSD is similar ( Figure 4 G). However, the steric extrusion of L229 ECL2 in HTR2A and the H-bond interaction of S242 5.46 together may cause a slight rotation and leftward shift of the ergoline ring. ( Figure 4 G). In the LSD-HTR2A structure, LSD forms a hydrogen bond between the indole-NH and side chain of S242 5.46 , and we next preformed additional experiments to gain insight into this interaction. We found that mutation of S242 5.46 to an alanine does not significantly change the binding affinity of LSD, although this mutation accelerates its dissociation rate, implying that this unique residue may contribute to LSD’s unusually long binding kinetics ( Figure 4 F). As expected, because the S242 5.46 does not directly interact with 25CN-NBOH, the S242A 5.46 mutation has no effect on 25CN-NBOH’s potency or efficacy in BRET ( Figure S6 B; Table S5 ).
Guided by this structure, we also evaluated potential binding modes of the endogenous agonist 5-HT using molecular docking ( Coleman et al., 2013 12. Coleman, R.G. ∙ Carchia, M. ∙ Sterling, T. ... Ligand pose and orientational sampling in molecular docking PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e75992 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the docked conformation ( Figure S6 D), the positively charged primary amine of serotonin forms a salt-bridge with the anionic D155 3.32 (distance 2.8 Å) as predicted by mutagenesis studies ( Kristiansen et al., 2000 37. Kristiansen, K. ∙ Kroeze, W.K. ∙ Willins, D.L. ... A highly conserved aspartic acid (Asp-155) anchors the terminal amine moiety of tryptamines and is involved in membrane targeting of the 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptor but does not participate in activation via a “salt-bridge disruption” mechanism J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293 :735-746 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In further agreement with many prior mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies ( Kristiansen et al., 2000 37. Kristiansen, K. ∙ Kroeze, W.K. ∙ Willins, D.L. ... A highly conserved aspartic acid (Asp-155) anchors the terminal amine moiety of tryptamines and is involved in membrane targeting of the 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptor but does not participate in activation via a “salt-bridge disruption” mechanism J.

Assessment of the roles of serines 5.43(239) and 5.46(242) for binding and potency of agonist ligands at the human serotonin 5-HT2A receptor Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72 :1200-1209 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) 5-HT is also predicted to be stabilized by aromatic interactions with F340 6.52 and F339 6.51 and hydrogen bonds with N343 6.55 and S242 5.46 . N343 6.55 was previously implicated from molecular modeling studies ( Kristiansen et al., 2000 37. Kristiansen, K. ∙ Kroeze, W.K. ∙ Willins, D.L. ... A highly conserved aspartic acid (Asp-155) anchors the terminal amine moiety of tryptamines and is involved in membrane targeting of the 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptor but does not participate in activation via a “salt-bridge disruption” mechanism J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293 :735-746 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and was here found to be essential for 5-HT’s agonist potency ( Figure S5 B; Table S5 ). As predicted from the HTR2A-LSD structure, the N343 6.55 A mutation did not affect LSD’s agonist potency, efficacy, or binding affinity ( Figures S5 A and S5B).
A major interface between HTR2A and the Gαq subunit is mediated by the C-terminal helix (α5 helix) of Gαq as suggested by G protein-bound structures ( Kato et al., 2019 32.

In detail, HTR2A residues N107 2.37 , D172 3.49 , N317 6.29 , and N384 8.47 form H-bonds with Gαq residues E242 H5.22 , Y243 H5.23 , Q237 H5.17 , and N244 H5.24 , respectively (superscription is CGN numbering system) ( Flock et al., 2015 18. Flock, T. ∙ Ravarani, C.N.J. ∙ Sun, D. ... Universal allosteric mechanism for Gα activation by GPCRs Nature. 2015; 524 :173-179 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, the residues A321 6.33 , L261 5.65 , I177 3.54 , L325 6.37 , and V324 6.36 of HTR2A form a hydrophobic core with L236 H5.16 , L240 H5.20 , and L245 H5.25 of Gαq ( Figure 5 A). Considering these residues form the major interactions between HTR2A and Gαq, alanine mutagenesis studies were conducted, and BRET2 assays were performed to determine which might be key for Gαq recognition. Measurement of receptor expression levels showed that these mutants, for both receptors and Gαq proteins, generally maintain robust whole cell ( Figure S5 E) and receptor cell surface ( Figure S5 F) expression, although some mutations slightly decreased receptor expression levels compared to wild-type ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Among the HTR2A mutations, N384A 8.47 and L325A 6.37 dramatically reduced receptor-Gαq coupling compared to wild-type, whereas R185A ICL2 and N107A 2.37 decreased the efficacy of 25CN-NBOH by 50%, indicating that these residues probably play a crucial role in G protein signaling ( Figure 5 B). Among the Gαq mutations, the agonist activity of 25CN-NBOH was completely abolished by Q237A H5.17 ( Figure 5 C). Q237 H5.17 is a highly conserved residue in the Gαq family (Lys in Gαi/o family and Arg in Gαs family), indicating that this residue may be involved in Gαq specificity ( Figure S7 D). N244 H5.24 is also a conserved residue existing only in the Gαq family (Gly in Gαi/o, Met in G12/13, and Glu in Gαs family), and expectedly, the N244A H5.24 mutant significantly decreases both the potency and efficacy of 25CN-NBOH ( Figures 5 A and 5C), indicating that it may also contribute to receptor-Gαq coupling.
An unexpected interaction was exemplified by R185 ICL2 that undergoes a dramatic10.5 Å rearrangement from being displaced upward toward the helical core to a close engagement via backbone interactions with R32 near the bottom of the α5 helix ( Figures 5 B and 7 H). The essential nature of this interaction was demonstrated by the R185A ICL2 mutation that significantly attenuated agonist potency ( Figure 5 C; Table S7 ). In a similar manner, N384 8,47 transitions toward the α5 helix with an ∼3 Å movement where it engages N244 H5.24 near the tip of the α5 helix ( Figure 7 G).
We next compared the Gq interface with the recent M1-muscarinic G11 interface to explore features responsible for Gαq subunit specificity. We found that the terminal hydroxyl of Y243, which is comparable to Y356 on the extreme terminus of the α5 helix and that has been implicated in receptor-G protein selectivity, was shifted 2.9 Å to create additional interactions with HTR2A that are not present in the M1 muscarinic receptor ( Figure 6 A). Additionally the terminal N-L-V motif, which is conserved among all Gq-like Gα subunits, was displaced downward to achieve a previously unreported interacting surface with the terminus of TM7 of M1 ( Figure 6 A). By contrast, in the Gq-HTR2A structure, the terminal V246 (that corresponds to V359 in M1-G11) is shifted upward 4.8 Å to avoid a potential clash with TM7 ( Figure 6 A). Overall, this illustrates a striking rearrangement of the key terminal residues in HTR2A-Gq versus M1- G11 to afford productive interactions with the core of the respective Gq/11-coupled GPCRs ( Figure 6 A). These results indicate that although the motifs used by different Gq-family subunits to afford receptor selectivity might be conserved, the interactions to mediate this selectivity are apparently distinct.
Recent studies performed with chimeric G proteins have indicated that GPCRs may interact with a much larger diversity of Gα subunits than previously anticipated ( Inoue et al., 2019 29. Inoue, A. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Kadji, F.M.N. ... Illuminating G-Protein-Coupling Selectivity of GPCRs Cell. 2019; 177 :1933-1947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). These authors ( Inoue et al., 2019 29. Inoue, A. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Kadji, F.M.N. ... Illuminating G-Protein-Coupling Selectivity of GPCRs Cell. 2019; 177 :1933-1947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ) provided data indicating that HTR2A can activate not only Gq-family Ga subunits but also several members of the Gi (Gαi1, Gαi3, GαO, and Gαz) and, minimally, Gαs family members (albeit with low relative intrinsic activity). Because these results are surprising, given the specific and non-conserved interactions we visualized in our 5-HT2A-Gq structure, we compared the structures of another 5-HT receptor in complex with a Gi-family member—5-HT1B-Gαo ( García-Nafría et al., 2018 20. García-Nafría, J. ∙ Nehmé, R. ∙ Edwards, P.C. ... Cryo-EM structure of the serotonin 5-HT 1B receptor coupled to heterotrimeric G o Nature. 2018; 558 :620-623 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). A comparison of the two structures revealed that the terminal Y354 of Gαo is displaced 10 Å down from the terminal V246 of Gαq where it cannot interact with any known residues of 5-HT2A ( Figure 6 B). As well, the interaction surface formed by the final 5 residues of the α5 helix of Gαo are not expected to form productive interactions with any of the closest residues in either TM7 or TM6 ( Figure 6 B) in HTR2A.
These results suggested to us that it was unlikely, based on an examination of these two structures, that HTR2A would productively interact with Gαo or related Gαi proteins. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the ability of HTR2A to productively interact with 14 distinct Gα subunits using our recently described BRET-based technology ( Olsen et al., 2020 54. Olsen, R.H.J. ∙ DiBerto, J.F. ∙ English, J.G. ... TRUPATH, an open-source biosensor platform for interrogating the GPCR transducerome Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16 :841-849 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). As shown in Figures 6 C and 6D, HTR2A coupled robustly to Gq-family members and minimally to conventional Gi- or Gs-family members. A diminished but reproducible response was seen for the pertussis-toxin-insensitive Gz. We verified the Gz interactions by showing a lack of response to the agonists in the presence of the HTR2A-selective antagonist M100907 (10 μM) and a lack of response in cells not transfected with HTR2A plasmid ( Figure 6 D).
Residue I181(ICL2) 34.51 is highly conserved among the GPCR family and has been reported to play a crucial role in Gαs or Gαq coupling, but not Gαi/o ( Moro et al., 1993 48. Moro, O. ∙ Lameh, J. ∙ Sadée, W. Serine- and threonine-rich domain regulates internalization of muscarinic cholinergic receptors J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 :6862-6865 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the HTR2A/Gαq structure, I181 34.51 interacts with L34 S1.02 , V79 S3.01 , F228 H5.08 , and I235 H5.15 of Gαq via hydrophobic interactions ( Figure 5 B). We found that the I181A 34.51 and I181E 34.51 mutations completely abolished the Gαq activation by 25CN-NBOH, while potentiating its activity in arrestin recruitment ( Figures 7 A and 7D). As shown in Figures 7 B and 7C, the I181A 34.51 and I181E 34.51 mutations similarly either attenuated ( Figure 7 B) or abolished ( Figure 7 C) the ability of LSD and 5-HT respectively, to activate Gαq (see Table S5 for fitted parameters).
Finally, we observed that when most Family A active state structures are superimposed, the phenolic hydroxyl group of Y 5.58 is located in the inner core of TM6. It has been reported that Y 5.58 forms a water mediated-hydrogen bond network with R 3.50 (the middle part of the E/DRY motif) and Y 7.53 (the latter part of the NPXXY motif) as previously suggested ( Weis and Kobilka, 2018 81. Weis, W.I. ∙ Kobilka, B.K. The Molecular Basis of G Protein-Coupled Receptor Activation Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :897-919 Crossref Scopus (683) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, in the case of HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, the phenolic hydroxyl of Y 5.58 is displaced outward from TM6 ( Figure S7 A). Y 5.58 apparently interacts with F 6.41 by π-stacking interactions ( Figure S7 B). The sequence alignment of all aminergic receptors shows that F 6.41 in the HTR2s is highly conserved ( Figure S7 C), and this represents one of the possible reasons for the observed outward orientation of Y 5.58 in TM6.

Section: Discussion

In this paper, we determined the agonist-activated structure of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor coupled to its canonical transducer Gαq, compared it with inactive state structures stabilized by both the partial agonist LSD and the inverse agonist methiothepin, and identified key determinants essential for agonist actions and receptor-Gq coupling. Because the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of classical psychedelics including LSD, psilocin, mescaline, and various N-BOH analogs, these studies provide structural insights into the actions of psychedelics at their molecular target. Importantly, we also discovered that the specific interactions the 5-HT2A receptor achieves with Gq residues are essential for the apparently selective engagement of this receptor with Gq-family proteins in vitro .
Some of these findings contrast with predictions from a recent study utilizing chimeric Gα subunits that indicated that HTR2A interact efficiently with all of the 11 tested Gα subunits, albeit with low efficacy at Gαs ( Inoue et al., 2019 29. Inoue, A. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Kadji, F.M.N. ... Illuminating G-Protein-Coupling Selectivity of GPCRs Cell. 2019; 177 :1933-1947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the Gα subtypes in that study ( Inoue et al., 2019 29. Inoue, A. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Kadji, F.M.N. ... Illuminating G-Protein-Coupling Selectivity of GPCRs Cell. 2019; 177 :1933-1947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ) were created by replacing the terminal seven amino acids of Gq with the corresponding sequences from several other Gα subunits using the motif LXXXLX (where X = subtype selective sequences) ( Inoue et al., 2019 29. Inoue, A. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Kadji, F.M.N. ... Illuminating G-Protein-Coupling Selectivity of GPCRs Cell. 2019; 177 :1933-1947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pertinent to this, we note that immediately prior to L353 is Q352 that is conserved among all of the chimeric G proteins employed in the study by Inoue et al. (2019) 29. Inoue, A. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Kadji, F.M.N. ... Illuminating G-Protein-Coupling Selectivity of GPCRs Cell. 2019; 177 :1933-1947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar . Here, we discovered that the Q352 cognate residue directly interacts with HTR2A TM6 residue N317 6.29 , and mutation of this residue abolishes the ability of HTR2A to activate Gq. We also point out that in the only other Gq-GPCR structure available, the same Q352 interacts directly with the TM5 residue R 5.46 ( Maeda et al., 2019 42. Maeda, S. ∙ Qu, Q. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes Science. 2019; 364 :552-557 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, using assays in which full-length heterotrimeric G proteins were used, we find that HTR2A productively couples weakly with only one Gi-family member, Gαz.
Relevant to these findings, we also found important interactions outside the α5 helix that are essential for HTR2A-Gq interactions. Thus, R132 ICL2 interacts via an extended backbone interaction with N32 of the α-helical domain, and we further demonstrated via mutagenesis and functional assays that this interaction is essential for agonist-induced activation of Gq. This GPCR-Gq interaction is not seen in the M1-G11 structure, although R134 ICL2 in M1 could weakly interact with the backbone carbonyl of R32 in Gq based on an examination of that prior structure. These results underscore suggestions made decades ago that the selectivity determinants for Gα subunits may not be entirely specified by reside in their terminal 5–7 amino acids ( Wess, 1997 82. Wess, J. G-protein-coupled receptors: molecular mechanisms involved in receptor activation and selectivity of G-protein recognition FASEB J. 1997; 11 :346-354 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also discovered that a key hydrophobic residue essential for G protein coupling among various GPCRs—I181 ICL2 —when mutated, abolishes Gαq coupling while potentiating arrestin binding at HTR2A. This result was unexpected because there was no prior data with sufficiently high resolution of GPCR-arrestin complexes that could illuminate how the mutation of a single amino acid at the GPCR-Gα interface would switch the coupling of HTR2A from an unbiased to an arrestin-exclusive state. While this paper was in revision, however, a 3.3 Å resolution structure of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor complexed with human β-arrestin1 was reported ( Lee et al., 2020 39. Lee, Y. ∙ Warne, T. ∙ Nehme, R. ... Molecular basis of β-arrestin coupling to formoterol-bound β1-adrenoceptor Nature. 2020; 583 :862-866 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). A comparison of this structure with the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor ( Rasmussen et al., 2011 60. Rasmussen, S.G. ∙ DeVree, B.T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex Nature. 2011; 477 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (2475) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our HTR2A-Gq structure reveals that the cognate hydrophobic residue F139 ICL2 in β2-AR interacts with the Gs α5-helix in a manner similar to HTR2A-Gq. In the β1 adrenergic receptor-Arrestin structure, by contrast, F147 ICL2 is displaced upward where it would potentially clash with residues in the α5 helix of Gs ( Figure 7 I) and where it is engaged in no productive interactions. A similar relative lack of extensive engagement of this cognate residue with arrestins can be seen in the lower resolution muscarinic- and neurotensin-receptor arrestin complexes ( Huang et al., 2020 28. Huang, W. ∙ Masureel, M. ∙ Qu, Q. ... Structure of the neurotensin receptor 1 in complex with beta-arrestin 1 Nature. 2020; 579 :303-308 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Staus et al., 2020 72. Staus, D.P. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of the M2 muscarinic receptor-β-arrestin complex in a lipid nanodisc Nature. 2020; 579 :297-302 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 J) This analysis provides a potential structural explanation for how loss of this hydrophobic interaction impairs Gq subunit coupling while preserving arrestin interaction—at least for HTR2A.
In addition to these fundamental insights into GPCR-Gq interactions, our findings have relevance for neuropsychiatric drug discovery. Psilocybin and LSD have emerged as potential therapeutics for a number of neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and cluster headaches ( Carhart-Harris et al., 2016 8. Carhart-Harris, R.L. ∙ Bolstridge, M. ∙ Rucker, J. ...

Psychedelic Psychiatry’s Brave New World Cell. 2020; 181 :24-28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of psilocybin in humans ( Kometer et al., 2013 35. Kometer, M. ∙ Schmidt, A. ∙ Jäncke, L. ... Activation of serotonin 2A receptors underlies the psilocybin-induced effects on α oscillations, N170 visual-evoked potentials, and visual hallucinations J.

Psychedelic Psychiatry’s Brave New World Cell. 2020; 181 :24-28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ), insights into the molecular details of both HTR2A ligand recognition and HTR2A-effector coupling are key to arriving at a molecular understanding of hallucinogen actions. Additionally, these studies will provide a framework for a structure-guided search to identify more selective and efficacious HTR2A agonists as potential innovative neuropsychiatric therapeutics as recently exemplified by us for other GPCRs ( Lyu et al., 2019 40.

The following structure files are available from the Protein Databank: 6WHA, 6WGT and 6WH4.
The following eukaryotic cell lines were used: Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and HEK293T cells. The HEK293T cells were obtained directly from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-11268) and have been validated by analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profiles and these profiles showed 100% match at the STR database from ATCC. The Sf9 cells were obtained as Sf-900 II SFM cells from Invitrogen and were not validated further.
HEKT cells were grown in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO 2 using media supplemented with 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Cat#15140-122). The human cell lines HEK293T were maintained in DMEM (VWR, #45000) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, VWR, #89510-186). At 24-48 hr prior to studies, HEKT cells were cultured in the above media containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, #FB-03) instead of 10% fetal bovine serum to remove serotonin. For expression studies, Sf9 cells were grown at 27 C at a cell density of 2 X 10 6 cells/ml in ESF921 medium (Expression systems) with P1 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3.
For crystallization, the modified thermostabilized apocytochrome b562RIL (BRIL) as a fusion partner was inserted into the receptor’s third intracellular loop (ICL3) at A265 and T311 of the human 5-HT2A gene. The construct was further optimized by truncation of N-terminal residues 1-65 and C-terminal residues 405-471. The ΔN65-5HT2A-BRIL-ΔC405 DNA was subcloned into a modified pFASTBac1 vector for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. All constructs also contained a hemagglutinin (HA) signal sequence followed by a FLAG tag at the N terminus and a PresCission protease site followed by a 10X histidine tag (His tag) at the C terminus to enable purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. To increase the thermostability and homogeneity of the 5-HT2A, two point mutations, Leu247Ala and Leu371Ala, were introduced in by standard Quick Change PCR ( Figure S2 A). For the cryoEM study, wild-type human HTR2A was truncated in N-terminal residues 1-65 and C-terminal residues 405-471 to enhance expression levels, and a haemagglutinin (HA) signal sequence followed by FLAG-, His10-tag, TEV protease site, BRIL, HRV3C and linker “GSGSG” at the N terminus were indroduced ( Figure S1 A). This construct also was subcloned into a modified pFASTBac1 vector.
The Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) was used to generate high-titer recombinant baculovirus (> 10 9 viral particles per ml). Recombinant baculovirus was obtained by transfecting ∼5 μg of recombinant bacmid into 5X10 5 per well settled Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) in a 12-well plate (Corning) using 3 μL of Cellfectin II reagent (Invitrogen). After 5-12h, medium was exchanged for 1 mL of Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen), and the plates were incubated for 4-6d at 27°C. P0 viral stock was harvested as the supernatant and used to generate high-titer baculovirus stock by infection of 40 mL of 3X10 6 Sf9 cells/ml and incubation for 3d. Viral titers were determined by flow cytometry analysis of cells that were immobilized with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated gp64 antibody (Expression Systems) ( Hanson et al., 2007 27. Hanson, M.A. ∙ Brooun, A. ∙ Baker, K.A. ... Profiling of membrane protein variants in a baculovirus system by coupling cell-surface detection with small-scale parallel expression Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 56 :85-92 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression of 5-HT2A was carried out by infection of sf9 cells at a cell density of 2 X 10 6 cells/ml in ESF921 medium (Expression systems) with P1 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 48 h after infection, washed in TN buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM NaCl, pH7.5) and stored at −80°C until use.
Thawed insect cell membranes were disrupted in a hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 20 mM KCl and protease inhibitors containing 500 μM AEBSF, 1 μM E-64, 1 μM Leupeptin and 0.15 μM Aprotinin. Subsequently, soluble and membrane associated proteins were removed in a high osmotic buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH7.5), 1,000 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 20 mM KCl. Purified membranes were incubated in the presence of desired ligands (50 μM 25CNNBOH, LSD or methiothepin) and protease inhibitor cocktail at 4°C for 2 h. The membranes were incubated with 2.0 mg/ml iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 30 min and were solubilized in the buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace), 0.2% (w/v) cholesterol hemisuccnate (CHS, Sigma) and 150 mM NaCl, at 4°C for 2h. The solubilized HTR2A proteins in the supernatants were isolated by ultra-centrifugation in 40,000 rpm at 4°C for 50 min, and then incubated at 4°C overnight with TALON IMAC resin (Clontech), 800 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole as the final buffer concentration. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of washing buffer I containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1% (w/v) DDM, 0.02% (w/v) CHS, 800 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM imidazole and 50 uM of desired ligands (25CN-NBOH, LSD or methiothepin) and 10 column volumes of washing buffer II 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.05% (w/v) DDM, 0.01% (w/v) CHS, 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 μM of desired ligands (50 μM 25CN-NBOH, LSD or methiothepin) without imidazole. The protein was eluted using 3 column volumes of elution buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.05% (w/v) DDM, 0.01% (w/v) CHS), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 250 mM imidazole and 50 μM of desired ligands (25CN-NBOH, LSD or methiothepin) and concentrated in a Vivaspin 20 concentrator with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kDa (Satorius Stedim) to 500 μl. The followed methods differed with crystal and CryoEM construct purifications. For the crystal construct purification, the 500 μL of 5HT2A protein sample was applied to PD MiniTrap G-25 columns (GE Healthcare) to remove imidazole. The C-terminal 10 X His tag was removed by addition of His-tagged PreScission protease (GeneScript) and incubation overnight at 4°C. Protease, cleaved His tag and uncleaved protein were trapped by equilibrated TALON IMAC resin (Clontech) and collecting the flow-through. 5-HT2A/LSD or methiothepin complexes were then concentrated to ∼30 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 500 centrifuge concentrator with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kDa (Sartorius Stedim). Protein purity and monodispersity were tested by analytical size-exclusion chromatography column, SRT-300 (Sepax scientific) and Ultimate 3000 UHPLC systems (Thermo Scientific). For the CryoEM construct purification, the 500 μL of 5HT2A protein sample was applied to PD MiniTrap G-25 columns (GE Healthcare) to remove imidazole with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) LMNG, 0.05% (w/v) CHS, 0.00025% (w/v) GDN, 100 uM TCEP, and 50 μM 25CN-NBOH. The N-terminal BRIL was removed by addition of His-tagged PreScission protease (GeneScript) and incubation overnight at 4°C. Protease, cleaved BRIL and uncleaved protein were trapped by equilibrated TALON IMAC resin (Clontech) and the flow-through was collected. The BRIL removed HTR2A was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 10/300 gel filtration column (GE) with SEC buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.001% (w/v) LMNG, 0.0001% (w/v) CHS, 0.00025% (w/v) GDN, 100 uM TCEP, 1 mM MgCl2 and 10 uM GDP, and collected until use.
The mini-Gαq iN chimeric construct was designed for the binding of scFv16 and sub-cloned into a designed vector that help form heterotrimeric G complex in situ ( Figure S1 ). For the expression, Sf9 insect cells were infected with one virus, encoding three subunits including the mini-Gαq iN subunit and Gβ1/γ2 subunits with histidine tag inserted at the amino terminus of the β subunit. Cells expressing the heterotrimeric G-protein were harvested 72 hours post infection. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM GDP, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 % (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, and the soluble fraction was isolated by ultra-centrifugation at 40,000 rpm at 4°C for 50 min. The heterotrimer containing soluble fraction was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography. Human Rhinovirus 3C protease (HRV3C protease) was added and the histidine tag was cleaved at 4°C for overnight. The histidine tag removed heterotrimeric G protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 gel filtration column (GE) with SEC buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.001% (w/v) LMNG, 0.0001% (w/v) CHS, 0.00025% (w/v) GDN, 100 uM TCEP, 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 uM GDP, and collected and concentrated to ∼25 mg/ml, and stored at −80°C until use.
ScF16 was expressed from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells as a secreted protein using baculovirus infection system and the purification process exactly as previously reported ( Maeda et al., 2018 41. Maeda, S. ∙ Koehl, A. ∙ Matile, H. ... Development of an antibody fragment that stabilizes GPCR/G-protein complexes Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3712 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Media expressing scFv16 from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) was pH balanced to pH 8.0 by addition of Tris powder. Chelating agents were quenched by addition of 1 mM nickel and 5 mM calcium chloride and incubation with stirring for 1 hour at 25°C. The precipitants were removed by centrifugation at 16,263 g for 30 min and supernatant was incubated with His60 Ni Superflow Resin (Takara) for 5 hours. The resin was loaded over Poly-Prep Chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and washed with the washing buffer (20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Imidazole). The protein was eluted with the elution buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 300 mM Imidazole) and treated the HRC-3C protease to cleave the carboxy-terminal octa-histidine tag. Cleaved protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE healthcare). Monomeric fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C freezer until use. Purified scFv16 was concentrated, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen until further use. Purified HTR2A/25CN-NBOH was mixed with a 1.2 molar excess of mini-Gαq iN heterotrimer. The coupling reaction was allowed to proceed at 24°C for 1 hr and was followed by addition of 0.2 U/ml (final concentration) of apyrase to catalyze hydrolysis of unbound GDP. After one hour, a 1.5 molar excess of scFv16 was added to the HTR2A /mini-Gαq mixture and incubated overnight at 4°C. HTR2A/mini-Gαq iN heterotrimer/scFv16 complex was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 column in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.001% (w/v) LMNG, 0.0001% (w/v) CHS, 0.00025% (w/v) GDN, 100 uM TCEP, 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 μM GDP. Peak fractions were concentrated to ∼17 mg/ml for electron microscopy studies.
The sample (3.5 μL) was applied at a concentration of 17 mg/mL to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3) and vitrified using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) at 22°C and 100% humidity, and plunged frozen into liquid ethane. CryoEM imaging was performed on a Titan Krios (ThermoFisher) electron microscope operated at 300 kV with a K3 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) at a magnification of 57,050x in counting mode. 2368 movies of 50 frames each (4 s exposure) were obtained at a total dose of 82 electrons/Å 2 and defocus ranging from −0.8 to −2.1 μm. Dose-fractionated image stacks were subjected to beam-induced motion correction and dose-weighting using MotionCor2. Contrast transfer function parameters for corrected micrographs were determined by Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 84. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 2.7 million particles were extracted from 2368 micrographs using semi-automated particle selection. 2D and 3D classification rounds were performed on a binned dataset (pixel size 1.704Å) using Relion 3.0 ( Scheres, 2012 65. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ). A subset of 168,570 particles were selected for the final map. The unbinned (with pixel size of 0.8421Å) particle set was subjected to Ctf Refinement and two rounds of Bayesian Polishing before the final refinement and sharpening was applied.
The final map was postprocessed in Relion with a temperature factor of −90 Å 2 . The resolution of the final map at the 0.143 FSC threshold was estimated to be 3.27 Å by Relion and 3.23 Å using Mtriage in PHENIX ( Table S1 ).
Homology models of active-state HTR2A were built by SWISS-MODEL ( Guex and Peitsch, 1997 23. Guex, N. ∙ Peitsch, M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling Electrophoresis. 1997; 18 :2714-2723 Crossref Scopus (9995) PubMed Google Scholar ) using HTR2C (PDB code 6BQG ) ( Peng et al., 2018 55. Peng, Y. ∙ McCorvy, J.D. ∙ Harpsoe, K. ... 5-HT2C Receptor Structures Reveal the Structural Basis of GPCR Polypharmacology Cell. 2018; 172 :719-730 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the receptor and M1R/G11 (PDB code 6OIJ ) ( Maeda et al., 2019 42.

Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes Science. 2019; 364 :552-557 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the G-protein as template models, respectively. All models were docked into the EM density map using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 57. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33470) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by iterative manual adjustment in COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 15. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25424) PubMed Google Scholar ) and phenix.real_space_refine in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18497) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model statistics was validated using Molprobity ( Chen et al., 2010 11. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11099) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural figures were prepared by Chimera or Pymol ( https://pymol.org/2 ). The final refinement statistics were provided in Table S1 .
The purified 5-HT2A protein in complex with LSD and methiothepin was screened for crystallization in lipidic cubic phase (LCP) with mixed molten lipid (90% (w/v) monoolein and 10% (w/v) cholesterol) at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:1.5 (v/v) using a mechanical syringe mixer ( Caffrey and Cherezov, 2009 7. Caffrey, M. ∙ Cherezov, V. Crystallizing membrane proteins using lipidic mesophases Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :706-731 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). Crystallization was done on 96-well glass sandwich plates (Marienfeld) in 50 nL LCP drops that were dispersed from a 10 μL gas-tight pipette (Hamilton) using a handheld dispenser (Art Robbins Instruments) and overlaid with 1 μL of precipitant solution. After optimization, crystals were obtained in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 380-430 mM potassium phosphate monobasic, 27%–32% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400), 100 mM guanidine hydrochloride and 300 mM NDSB-195. Crystals grew to a maximum size of ∼30 μm X 20 μm X 20 μm within 2 weeks and were harvested directly from the LCP plates using MiTeGen micromounts and storage in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data of 5-HT2A/LSD and methiothepin crystals were collected at beam line 23ID-B (GM/CA CAT) of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL, USA) using a 10-μm minibeam at a wavelength of 1.0330 Å and an Eiger-16 m detector (Dectris) and beam line 17ID-2 (FMX) of the NSLS-II (Brookhaven, NY, USA). The data collection strategy was set up as an exposing the crystals for 0.2 s to an unattenuated beam using 0.2° oscillation. Diffraction images were indexed, integrated and scaled, and merged using XDS ( Kabsch, 2010a 30. Kabsch, W. Integration, scaling, space-group assignment and post-refinement Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :133-144 Crossref Scopus (1934) PubMed Google Scholar , 2010b 31. Kabsch, W. Xds Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12939) PubMed Google Scholar ) and further scaled using AIMLESS ( Evans, 2006 16. Evans, P. Scaling and assessment of data quality Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :72-82 Crossref Scopus (4016) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initial phase was obtained by molecular replacement (MR) method with Phaser ( McCoy, 2007 45. McCoy, A.J. Solving structures of protein complexes by molecular replacement with Phaser Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63 :32-41 Crossref Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar ; McCoy et al., 2007 46. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (16091) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the receptor and BRIL portion of 5-HT2B/LSD (PDB: 5TVN ) as independent search models ( Wacker et al., 2017b 78. Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ McCorvy, J.D. ... Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor Cell. 2017; 168 :377-389 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). Refinement was carried out with Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18497) PubMed Google Scholar ) and REFMAC ( Murshudov et al., 1997 49. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Vagin, A.A. ∙ Dodson, E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53 :240-255 Crossref Scopus (14214) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by manual examination and adjustments of the refined structures in the program COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 15. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25424) PubMed Google Scholar ) with both 2|Fo|-|Fc| and |Fo|-|Fc| maps. After refinement, we did not observe any Ramachandran outliers in any of the structure: 95.98% and 4.02% for LSD, and 93.73% and 6.27% for methiothepin of favored and allowed regions, respectively, as defined by Ramachandran statistics. We further observed Molprobity scores of 2.04 for LSD, and 2.1 for methiothepin ( Table S2 ).
Competitive binding assays were performed using membrane preparations from HEK293 T cells transiently expressing HTR2A wt or mutants. Binding assays were set up in 96-well plates in the standard binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% BSA, 0.01% ascorbic acid, pH 7.40). Saturation binding assays with 0.1–20 nM [ 3 H]-LSD in standard binding buffer were performed to determine equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and Bmax, whereas 10 μM final concentration of LSD was used to define nonspecific binding. For the competition binding, 50 μL each of 3 H-LSD (final 0.6 nM), drug solution (3X) and homogeneous HTR2A membrane solution was incubated in 96-well plates in the standard binding buffer. Reactions (either saturation or competition binding) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark and terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto chilled 0.3% PEI-soaked GF/A filters followed by three quick washes with cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.40) and read. Results were analyzed using the equation ‘one-site fit Ki’ in GraphPad Prism 8.0.
The agonist 5-HT was docked into the active HTR2A structure bound to 25-CN-NBOH (chain A, current work) using DOCK3.7 ( Coleman et al., 2013 12. Coleman, R.G. ∙ Carchia, M. ∙ Sterling, T. ... Ligand pose and orientational sampling in molecular docking PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e75992 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the docking, 30280 complexes were sampled at the orthosteric binding site. Each pose was scored against three pre-calculated enegy grids which represent AMBER van der Waals potential ( Meng et al., 1992 47. Meng, E.C. ∙ Shoichet, B. ∙ Kuntz, I.D. Automated docking with grid-based energy evaluation J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13 :505-524 Crossref Scopus (903) Google Scholar ), Poisson–Boltzmann electrostatic potential by QNIFFTT ( Sharp et al., 1995 68. Sharp, K.A. ∙ Friedman, R.A. ∙ Misra, V. ... Salt effects on polyelectrolyte-ligand binding: comparison of Poisson-Boltzmann, and limiting law/counterion binding models Biopolymers. 1995; 36 :245-262 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Gallagher and Sharp, 1998 19. Gallagher, K. ∙ Sharp, K. Electrostatic contributions to heat capacity changes of DNA-ligand binding Biophys. J. 1998; 75 :769-776 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ligand desolvation ( Mysinger and Shoichet, 2010 50. Mysinger, M.M. ∙ Shoichet, B.K. Rapid context-dependent ligand desolvation in molecular docking J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2010; 50 :1561-1573 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. The best scoring 5-HT conformation received a docking score of −37.5 kcal/mol. The 3D dockable db2 file of 5-HT was downloaded from ZINC15 ( http://zinc15.docking.org/substances/ZINC000000057058/ ).
The 3D dockable db2 file of 25-CN-NBOH was generated using our standard protocol ( http://wiki.docking.org/index.php/Ligand_preparation_-_2017-04 ). The protonation states at pH 7.4 (Jchem version 15.11.23.0, ChemAxon, 2015; https://chemaxon.com ), 3D structures (Corina 4.2 https://www.mn-am.com/products/corina ), conformer ensembles (omega v.2.5.1.4, https://www.eyesopen.com/omega ), partial charges and desolvation energies (AMSOL version 7.1 https://comp.chem.umn.edu/amsol/ ) were calculated as previously described ( Sterling and Irwin, 2015 74. Sterling, T. ∙ Irwin, J.J. ZINC 15--Ligand Discovery for Everyone J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015; 55 :2324-2337 Crossref Scopus (2198) PubMed Google Scholar ) . The docking grids used were identical to those used for the 5-HT docking as follows. All steps in the standard protocol are identical to the steps in the ZINC15 pipeline ( Sterling and Irwin, 2015 74. Sterling, T. ∙ Irwin, J.J. ZINC 15--Ligand Discovery for Everyone J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015; 55 :2324-2337 Crossref Scopus (2198) PubMed Google Scholar ): Jchem (version 15.11.23.0, ChemAxon, 2015; https://chemaxon.com ) is used to enumerate the protonation states at pH 7.4 from an input SMILES. Each protonated SMILES is used to produce an initial 3D structure by Corina (version 4.2 https://www.mn-am.com/products/corina ). Based on the 3D conformer, AMSOL (version 7.1 https://comp.chem.umn.edu/amsol/ ) is used to compute partial charges and desolvation energies. OMEGA (version 2.5.1.4, https://www.eyesopen.com/omega ) is used to generate conformer ensembles. At the final step, mol2db2 compresses all the information calculated above into a dockable db2 file. Over 7,500 orientations were explored in the orthosteric site, resulting 2,723,040 complexes sampled during the docking (orientations x conformations). The best scoring pose received a favorable docking score of −44.2 kcal/mol. The ligand symmetry accounted r.m.s.d (0.16Å) between the docked pose and the cryo-EM pose is calculated by the Hungarian algorithm in DOCK6 ( Allen and Rizzo, 2014 2. Allen, W.J. ∙ Rizzo, R.C. Implementation of the Hungarian algorithm to account for ligand symmetry and similarity in structure-based design J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2014; 54 :518-529 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ) .
Radioligand dissociation assays were performed in parallel with the competitive binding assays utilizing the same concentrations of radioligand, membrane preparations, and binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 0.01% ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). All assays utilized at least two concentrations of radioligand ([ 3 H]-LSD = 0.4 and 1.2 nM) (PerkinElmer). For dissociation assays, membranes were incubated with radioligand for at least two hours at room temperature before the addition of 10 μL of 10 μM excess cold ligand LSD to the 200 μL membrane suspension at designated time points. Time points spanned 2 minutes to 7 hours. Immediately at time = 0 min, plates were harvested by vacuum filtration onto 0.3% polyethyleneimine pre-soaked 96-well filter mats (Perkin Elmer) using a 96-well Filtermate harvester, followed by three washes of cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4). Scintillation (Meltilex) cocktail (Perkin Elmer) was melted onto dried filters and radioactivity was counted using a Wallac Trilux MicroBeta counter (PerkinElmer). Data were analyzed using “Dissociation – One phase exponential decay” in Graphpad Prism 8.0.
To measure HTR2A-mediated β-arrestin2 recruitment, HEK293T cells were co-transfected in a 1:5 ratio with human 5-HT 2A R containing C-terminal Renilla luciferase ( R Luc8), and Venus-tagged N-terminal β-arrestin2. After at least 16 hours, transfected cells were plated in poly-lysine coated 96-well white clear bottom cell culture plates in plating media (DMEM + 1% dialyzed FBS) at a density of 25-50,000 cells in 200 μl per well and incubated overnight. The next day, media was decanted and cells were washed twice with 60 μL of drug buffer (1 × HBSS, 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 0.01% ascorbic acid, pH 7.4), then 60 μL of drug buffer was added per well. For kinetic experiments, plates were incubated at 37°C at least 20 minutes prior to receiving drug stimulation. Afterward, 30 μL of drug (3X) was added per well and incubated for designated time points. Before reading, 10 μL of the R Luc substrate, coelenterazine h (Promega, 5 μM final concentration) was added per well, incubated an additional 5 minutes to allow for substrate diffusion, and plates were immediately read for both luminescence at 485 nm and fluorescent eYFP emission at 530 nm for 1 s per well using a Mithras LB940 multimode microplate reader. The ratio of eYFP/ R Luc was calculated per well and the net BRET ratio was calculated by subtracting the eYFP/ R Luc per well from the eYFP/ R Luc ratio in wells without Venus-β-Arrestin present. The net BRET ratio was plotted as a function of drug concentration using Graphpad Prism 5 (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Data were normalized to % 5-HT stimulation and analyzed using nonlinear regression “log(agonist) vs. response” in GraphPad Prism 8.0. For measurement of arrestin translocation at other GPCRs an identical approach was used.
For HTR2A-mediated G protein activation, HEK293T cells were plated either in six-well dishes containing 700-800,000 cells per well, or 10-cm dishes at approximately 7-8 million cells/dish. Cells were transfected 2-4 hours later, using a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the receptor:GαrLuc8:Gβ:Gγ GFP DNA ( Olsen et al., 2020 54. Olsen, R.H.J. ∙ DiBerto, J.F. ∙ English, J.G. ... TRUPATH, an open-source biosensor platform for interrogating the GPCR transducerome Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16 :841-849 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transit 2020 (Mirus biosciences) was used to complex the DNA at a ratio of 3 μL Transit/μg DNA, in OptiMEM (GIBCO) at a concentration of 10 ng DNA/μL OptiMEM. The next day, cells were harvested from the plate using Versene (0.1M PBS + 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), and plated in poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well white assay plates (Greiner) at a density of 25-50,000 cells per well.
One day after plating in 96-well assay plates, white backings (Perkin Elmer) were applied to the clear bottoms of the plate, and media was carefully aspirated and replaced with 50 μM coelenterazine 400a (nanolight technology) in 60 μL of drug buffer (1 × HBSS, 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 0.01% ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). After a five-minute equilibration period, cells were treated with 30 μL of the drug for an additional 5 minutes. Plates were then read in an LB940 Mithras plate reader (Berthold Technologies) with a 395 nm (RLuc8-coelenterazine 400a) and 510 nm (GFP2) emission filters, at 1 s integration times. Plates were read six times, and measurements from the sixth read were used in all analyses. BRET ratio was computed as the ratio of the GFP2 emission to rLuc8 emission. Data were normalized to % 5-HT stimulation and analyzed using nonlinear regression “log(agonist) vs. response” in GraphPad Prism 8.0. For measurement of G protein activation with reference ligands the approach above was used identically as described except that neurotensin was used as a control for NTSR1- neurotensin.
To confirm cell surface expression of HTR2A and its mutants, after 48hr transfected, immunocytochemistry was done using cells plated on 384-white plates at 10,000 cells/well. Cells were fixed with 20 μl/well of 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher, #AAJ19943K2) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed twice with 40 μl/well of PBS. Blocking was performed with 20 μl/well of 5% BSA (Akron, #AK8909) in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. After blocking, 20 μl/well of monoclonal ANTI-FLAG M2-Peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, A8592) diluted 1/10,000 in PBS was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. This was followed by two washes with 80 μl/well of PBS. Then, 20 μl/well of SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher, #37070) was added, and luminescence was counted using a PHERAstar FSX (BMG Labtech). Data were plotted as relative luminescent units (RLU) in GraphPad Prism 8.0.
For radioligand binding assays data were analyzed using “Dissociation – One phase exponential decay” in Graphpad Prism 8.0 for the kinetic studies and the the equation ‘one-site fit Ki’ in GraphPad Prism 8.0 for the inhibition studies. For the BRET studies, the net BRET ratio was plotted as a function of drug concentration using Graphpad Prism 8 (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) and data were normalized to % 5-HT or the reference agonist stimulation and analyzed using nonlinear regression “log(agonist) vs. response” in GraphPad Prism 8.0. For the cell surface expression studies Data were plotted as relative luminescent units (RLU) in GraphPad Prism 8.0. For the analysis of all fitted curves the goodness-of-fit was calculated by GraphPad Prism 8.0 and the data analyzed for parameter estimates was not evaluated for hetereskedasticity.
Data in figures and tables are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) with the number of biological and technical replicates indicated in the figure and table legends where “n” represents the number of biological replicates performed. EC 50 and Emax were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), and then a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test using comparing each mutant to the wild-type receptor. The family wise-significance and confidence level was set at 0.05. For the depiction of the heatmap of agonist efficacies, the on-line program MORPHEUS ( https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/ ) was used with the map paramters listed in the figure.
