Title: Dual Functions of a Rubisco Activase in Metabolic Repair and Recruitment to Carboxysomes


Abstract: Summary

Rubisco, the key enzyme of CO 2 fixation in photosynthesis, is prone to inactivation by inhibitory sugar phosphates. Inhibited Rubisco undergoes conformational repair by the hexameric AAA+ chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca) in a process that is not well understood. Here, we performed a structural and mechanistic analysis of cyanobacterial Rca, a close homolog of plant Rca. In the Rca:Rubisco complex, Rca is positioned over the Rubisco catalytic site under repair and pulls the N-terminal tail of the large Rubisco subunit (RbcL) into the hexamer pore. Simultaneous displacement of the C terminus of the adjacent RbcL opens the catalytic site for inhibitor release. An alternative interaction of Rca with Rubisco is mediated by C-terminal domains that resemble the small Rubisco subunit. These domains, together with the N-terminal AAA+ hexamer, ensure that Rca is packaged with Rubisco into carboxysomes. The cyanobacterial Rca is a dual-purpose protein with functions in Rubisco repair and carboxysome organization.

Section: Introduction

The AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca) serves as a paradigm of conformational enzyme repair ( Bhat et al., 2017b 11. Bhat, J.Y. ∙ Thieulin-Pardo, G. ∙ Hartl, F.U. ... Rubisco Activases: AAA+ Chaperones Adapted to Enzyme Repair Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 :20 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Mueller-Cajar, 2017 57. Mueller-Cajar, O. The diverse AAA+ machines that repair inhibited Rubisco active sites Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 :31 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). The exclusive client of Rca is the photosynthetic key enzyme Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), which is directly or indirectly responsible for all biomass production ( Bar-On and Milo, 2019 8. Bar-On, Y.M. ∙ Milo, R. The global mass and average rate of rubisco Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :4738-4743 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since Rca is required for optimal Rubisco function, understanding its mechanism is important in efforts to enhance photosynthesis with the goal of increasing crop yields ( Andralojc et al., 2018 3.

Rubisco catalyzes the carboxylation of the 5-carbon sugar ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle of photosynthesis. This multistep catalytic reaction produces two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate as fuel for the synthesis of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids. The most prevalent form of Rubisco (form I) in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria is a hexadecamer of eight large (RbcL; ∼50–55 kDa) and eight small (RbcS, ∼12–18 kDa) subunits. The RbcL subunits form a cube-shaped core, consisting of four antiparallel dimers, capped by four RbcS subunits at the top and bottom. Two catalytic sites per RbcL dimer unit are located at the interface between the N-terminal domain of one RbcL and the C-terminal domain of the other subunit. In order to become functionally competent, the RuBP binding site must be activated by carboxylation of the active-site lysine, which results in formation of a carbamate, and is followed by the binding of a Mg 2+ ion. This process is commonly referred to as carbamylation ( Hartman et al., 1987 36. Hartman, F.C. ∙ Soper, T.S. ∙ Niyogi, S.K. ...

Chem. 1987; 262 :3496-3501 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miziorko and Lorimer, 1983 56. Miziorko, H.M. ∙ Lorimer, G.H. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52 :507-535 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon binding of RuBP, the active site is sealed by the so-called “60s loop” from the N-terminal domain of one RbcL subunit and “loop 6” of the C-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit. The N-terminal sequence pins down the 60s loop and the C terminus stretches over loop 6. This arrangement generates the physical environment required for electrophilic attack of RuBP by CO 2 .
The requirement of Rca arises from the fact that the complex catalytic reaction of Rubisco is error prone, leading to the generation of tight-binding sugar phosphates that inactivate the enzyme. These “misfire” products include xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate (XuBP) and 2,3-pentodiulose-1,5-bisphosphate (PDBP) ( Parry et al., 2008 65. Parry, M.A.J. ∙ Keys, A.J. ∙ Madgwick, P.J. ... Rubisco regulation: a role for inhibitors J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59 :1569-1580 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, some plants under low light produce the inhibitory 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol-1-phosphate (CA1P) (referred to as “night-time” inhibitor). Binding of RuBP to non-carbamylated Rubisco can also lead to inactive enzyme ( Bracher et al., 2017 16. Bracher, A. ∙ Whitney, S.M. ∙ Hartl, F.U. ...

In all these conditions, the release of the inhibitory sugar is mediated by Rca, which couples ATP hydrolysis to structural remodeling of the Rubisco catalytic site. Rca proteins have evolved independently in photosynthetic organisms and are associated with the red and green lineages of Rubisco ( Bhat et al., 2017b 11.

While divergent in sequence, they all share the canonical AAA+ core consisting of an N-terminal α/β-nucleotide binding subdomain and a C-terminal α-helical subdomain ( Figure 1 A) and function as six-membered ring complexes. The AAA+ chaperones are typically substrate promiscuous and act by threading flexible terminal sequences or loop segments of their target proteins into the hexamer pore ( Olivares et al., 2016 61.

Threading is mediated by pore-loops ( Figure 1 A) that face the central pore and engage the substrate peptide, exerting a pulling force ( Avellaneda et al., 2020 4.

A low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Rca from the proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides ( Rs ) in complex with red-type Rubisco (form 1C) showed that the Rs Rca hexamer docks onto Rubisco over one catalytic site at a time ( Bhat et al., 2017a 10. Bhat, J.Y. ∙ Miličić, G. ∙ Thieulin-Pardo, G. ... Mechanism of enzyme repair by the AAA+ chaperone Rubisco activase Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :744-756.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rs Rca is positioned so as to allow threading of the extended C-terminal sequence of Rs RbcL into the central pore, facilitating opening of the catalytic site and release of the inhibitory sugar ( Bhat et al., 2017a 10. Bhat, J.Y. ∙ Miličić, G. ∙ Thieulin-Pardo, G. ... Mechanism of enzyme repair by the AAA+ chaperone Rubisco activase Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :744-756.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mueller-Cajar et al., 2011 58. Mueller-Cajar, O. ∙ Stotz, M. ∙ Wendler, P. ... Structure and function of the AAA+ protein CbbX, a red-type Rubisco activase Nature. 2011; 479 :194-199 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the mechanism of Rca in plants and green algae containing form IB Rubisco ( Tabita et al., 2008 92. Tabita, F.R. ∙ Satagopan, S. ∙ Hanson, T.E. ... Distinct form I, II, III, and IV Rubisco proteins from the three kingdoms of life provide clues about Rubisco evolution and structure/function relationships J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59 :1515-1524 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ) remains enigmatic, because form IB RbcL lacks the extended C-terminal sequence of red-type RbcL. Moreover, Rca of plants and green algae have a domain N-terminal to the AAA+ core that is required for Rubisco recognition ( Figure 1 A), and the so-called specificity helix H9 in the α-helical subdomain confers specificity for Rubisco proteins from solanaceous (nightshade) and non-solanaceous species ( Li et al., 2005 50. Li, C. ∙ Salvucci, M.E. ∙ Portis, Jr., A.R. Two residues of rubisco activase involved in recognition of the Rubisco substrate J. Biol.

Res. 2013; 117 :557-566 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mechanistic analysis of plant Rca has proven difficult, since the N-domain appears to be flexible and the protein, though active as a hexamer, tends to populate a range of dynamic oligomeric states in vitro ( Blayney et al., 2011 13. Blayney, M.J. ∙ Whitney, S.M. ∙ Beck, J.L. NanoESI mass spectrometry of Rubisco and Rubisco activase structures and their interactions with nucleotides and sugar phosphates J. Am. Soc.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1366-1370 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The closest sequence homolog to plant Rca is the “Rca-like” protein of several cyanobacteria with form IB Rubisco. Rca-like lacks the flexible N-terminal domain, but its AAA+ core is highly homologous to eukaryotic Rca, with ∼38% sequence identity and ∼70% similarity ( Data S1 ). Consistent with Rca function, the Rca-like protein of Anabaena sp. strain CA was shown to be required for elevated Rubisco activity and growth under high light conditions ( Li et al., 1999 49. Li, L.A. ∙ Zianni, M.R. ∙ Tabita, F.R. Inactivation of the monocistronic rca gene in Anabaena variabilis suggests a physiological ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase-like function in heterocystous cyanobacteria Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40 :467-478 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a recent study could not detect Rca activity for the Rca-like protein from Fremyella diplosiphon ( Lechno-Yossef et al., 2020 48. Lechno-Yossef, S. ∙ Rohnke, B.A. ∙ Belza, A.C.O. ... Cyanobacterial carboxysomes contain an unique rubisco-activase-like protein New Phytol. 2020; 225 :793-806 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). A distinguishing feature of Rca-like is the presence of a Rubisco small subunit-like (SSUL) domain, connected to the C terminus of the AAA+ core via a flexible linker ( Figure 1 A). The homologous SSUL modules of the scaffolding protein CcmM have been shown to bind to Rubisco, inducing condensate formation for packaging into carboxysomes ( Ryan et al., 2019 79.

Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), protein-bounded compartments in which high concentrations of CO 2 are generated for carbon fixation ( Badger and Price, 2003 5. Badger, M.R. ∙ Price, G.D. CO 2 concentrating mechanisms in cyanobacteria: molecular components, their diversity and evolution J. Exp.

Lett. 2017; 364 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the Rca-like protein of F. diplosiphon interacts with Rubisco via its SSUL domains, and its deletion resulted in impaired regulation of carboxysome biogenesis ( Lechno-Yossef et al., 2020 48. Lechno-Yossef, S. ∙ Rohnke, B.A. ∙ Belza, A.C.O. ... Cyanobacterial carboxysomes contain an unique rubisco-activase-like protein New Phytol. 2020; 225 :793-806 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To obtain insight into the basic mechanism of plant Rca, here we analyzed the structure and function of the Rca-like protein of the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 ( Nos Rca). We find that Nos Rca functions as a bona fide Rubisco activase, independent of the SSUL domain ( Nos RcaΔC). We solved the crystal structure of the Nos RcaΔC hexamer and obtained its high-resolution cryo-EM structure in complex with inhibited Rubisco. A key finding is the well-resolved N-terminal amino acid sequence of RbcL inserted into the central pore of the Rca hexamer. Mutational analysis confirmed that plant Rca also engages the N-terminal RbcL sequence of its cognate Rubisco, establishing binding of the N terminus rather than the C terminus as the basic mechanism for activation of form IB Rubisco. We further show that the SSUL domains cooperate with the AAA+ core to ensure that Rca is packaged with Rubisco into carboxysomes. The cyanobacterial Rca thus combines functions in Rubisco remodeling and carboxysome organization.

Section: Results

The purified recombinant Nos Rca protein, with and without nucleotide, behaved as a ∼260 kDa complex by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), consistent with a hexamer ( Figures S1 A and S1B; Table S1 ). Nos Rca had a constitutive ATPase activity of ∼6.5 min −1 per protomer ( Figure 1 B), which is lower than the ATPase rates reported for plant Rca (∼17–45 min −1 ) ( Hazra et al., 2015 38. Hazra, S. ∙ Henderson, J.N. ∙ Liles, K. ... Regulation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) activase: product inhibition, cooperativity, and magnesium activation J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :24222-24236 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next tested whether Nos Rca functions as a Rubisco activase, considering that the AAA+ modules of Nos Rca and the Rca proteins of Nicotiana tabacum ( Nt Rca) and Arabidopsis thaliana ( At Rca) share ∼ 59% sequence identity ( Data S2 ). Because activases are adapted to their cognate Rubisco ( Bhat et al., 2017b 11. Bhat, J.Y. ∙ Thieulin-Pardo, G. ∙ Hartl, F.U. ... Rubisco Activases: AAA+ Chaperones Adapted to Enzyme Repair Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 :20 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Mueller-Cajar, 2017 57. Mueller-Cajar, O. The diverse AAA+ machines that repair inhibited Rubisco active sites Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 :31 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), we recombinantly expressed and purified the Rubisco from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 ( Nos Rubisco) ( Figure S1 A) using coexpression of Nostoc chaperonin ( Nos GroES/EL; see STAR Methods ). The purified Nos Rubisco, activated with CO 2 and Mg 2+ (ECM), catalyzed the carboxylation of RuBP at a rate of ∼4 molecules of CO 2 per active site s −1 ( Figures 1 C and 1D). However, as shown previously ( Li et al., 1999 49. Li, L.A. ∙ Zianni, M.R. ∙ Tabita, F.R. Inactivation of the monocistronic rca gene in Anabaena variabilis suggests a physiological ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase-like function in heterocystous cyanobacteria Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40 :467-478 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), binding of RuBP to the non-activated enzyme did not result in inhibition ( Figure S1 C), in contrast to plant Rubisco ( Parry et al., 2008 65. Parry, M.A.J. ∙ Keys, A.J. ∙ Madgwick, P.J. ... Rubisco regulation: a role for inhibitors J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59 :1569-1580 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stotz et al., 2011 90.

Biol. 2011; 18 :1366-1370 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang and Portis, 1992 99. Wang, Z.Y. ∙ Portis, A.R. Dissociation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate bound to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and its enhancement by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase-mediated hydrolysis of ATP Plant Physiol. 1992; 99 :1348-1353 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore tested the effect of the misfire sugar phosphate XuBP as a competitive inhibitor ( Bracher et al., 2015 15. Bracher, A. ∙ Sharma, A. ∙ Starling-Windhof, A. ... Degradation of potent Rubisco inhibitor by selective sugar phosphatase Nat. Plants. 2015; 1 :14002 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). A ∼60%–80% inhibition of the carboxylation rate was observed at 50 to 150 µM XuBP in the presence of low RuBP (400 µM) ( Figure 1 C). Note that Nos Rubisco has a lower affinity for XuBP than plant Rubisco ( Bracher et al., 2015 15. Bracher, A. ∙ Sharma, A. ∙ Starling-Windhof, A. ... Degradation of potent Rubisco inhibitor by selective sugar phosphatase Nat. Plants. 2015; 1 :14002 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pearce, 2006 66. Pearce, F.G. Catalytic by-product formation and ligand binding by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylases from different phylogenies Biochem. J. 2006; 399 :525-534 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Addition of Nos Rca partially relieved the inhibition in an ATP-dependent manner ( Figure 1 C), suggesting that Nos Rca facilitated the release of XuBP from the Rubisco catalytic sites. The effect was only partial because the XuBP remained in the reaction as a competitive inhibitor. However, XuBP is unlikely to be a physiological inhibitor of Nos Rubisco, consistent with the absence in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 of XuBP phosphatase, which serves to hydrolyze the XuBP upon release ( Bracher et al., 2015 15. Bracher, A. ∙ Sharma, A. ∙ Starling-Windhof, A. ... Degradation of potent Rubisco inhibitor by selective sugar phosphatase Nat. Plants. 2015; 1 :14002 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Complete and highly efficient inhibition of Rubisco was obtained with 2-carboxyarabinitol-1,5-diphosphate (CABP), a mimic of the carboxyketone intermediate of the carboxylation reaction, at a concentration equivalent to Rubisco active sites (0.25 µM) ( Figure 1 D). Strikingly, Nos Rca efficiently reactivated the inhibited Rubisco in the presence of ATP ( Figures 1 D). Thus, Nos Rca is a bona fide Rubisco activase, although the endogenous inhibitory sugar phosphate(s) of Nos Rubisco remains to be identified. Deletion of the C-terminal 123 residues (linker and the SSUL domain) in Nos Rca ( Nos RcaΔC), resulted in a faster ATPase rate (∼9.5 min −1 ) and slightly more efficient Rubisco reactivation ( Figures 1 B and 1D), indicating that the SSUL domain is not required for activase function. The rate of reactivation was dependent on the concentration of Nos Rca ( Figure S1 D). Similar ATPase rates were measured in the presence of activated or inhibited Rubisco ( Figure 1 B), a property similar to plant Rca ( Robinson and Portis, 1989 77. Robinson, S.P. ∙ Portis, Jr., A.R. Adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by purified rubisco activase Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268 :93-99 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
To allow a structural comparison of Nos Rca with plant Rca, we solved the crystal structure of Nos RcaΔC (residues 2–291) at ∼2.7 Å by Gd-multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (Gd-MAD) ( Figure S1 A; Table S2 ). The resolution of the isomorphic native structure was 2.45 Å ( Table S2 ). The asymmetric unit contained two subunits of Nos RcaΔC, with chain A (residues 2–275) having no nucleotide bound and chain B (residues 2–278) having ADP bound ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S2 A). Note that the nucleotide bound during recombinant expression.
Nos RcaΔC shows the typical AAA+ fold topology, consisting of the N-terminal Rossmann-fold α/β subdomain and a smaller C-terminal α-helical subdomain ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The two Nos RcaΔC subunits had nearly identical subdomain conformations but differed in the inter-domain angle between the α/β and the α-helical subdomains by ∼11° ( Figure S2 B). Chain A superimposes well with the subunit structures of Nt Rca (rmsd 1.46 Å for 206 matching Cα positions) and At Rca (rmsd 1.96 Å for 219 matching Cα positions) ( Figures 2 C and S2 C). The α/β subdomains separately match almost perfectly (rmsd 0.53 Å and 0.52 Å, respectively). The structural conservation between Nos Rca and plant Rca includes the so-called specificity helix H9 (α9) in the α-helical subdomain ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Data S1 and S2 ). As in the Nt Rca and At Rca crystal lattices ( Hasse et al., 2015 37. Hasse, D. ∙ Larsson, A.M. ∙ Andersson, I. Structure of Arabidopsis thaliana Rubisco activase Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Structure of green-type Rubisco activase from tobacco Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1366-1370 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), the α/β subdomain and helix H9 of the adjacent subunit form a rigid module ( Figure S2 D). The orientation of helix H9 to the four-helix bundle of the α-helical subdomain is variable ( Figure S2 E). In the rhombohedral crystal lattice the Nos RcaΔC subunits form a hexamer with alternating ADP-bound and nucleotide-free subunits ( Figure 2 D). Note that Nos RcaΔC is a hexamer in solution ( Table S1 ). We define the surface at which helix H9 is located as cis and the opposite surface, from which the linkers to the SSUL domains would emanate, as trans ( Figure 2 D).
The interface between the α/β subdomain and α-helical subdomain of adjacent subunits contains the nucleotide binding site ( Figures 2 D and S2 A). In contrast to the pore-loops in the helical crystal structures of Nt Rca and At Rca ( Hasse et al., 2015 37. Hasse, D. ∙ Larsson, A.M. ∙ Andersson, I. Structure of Arabidopsis thaliana Rubisco activase Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2015; 71 :800-808 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stotz et al., 2011 90.

Biol. 2011; 18 :1366-1370 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), the pore-loops of Nos RcaΔC are ordered (PL1, residues 67–72; PL2, residues 105–119; PL3, residues 160–165), with the exception of the B chains where PL2 is disordered ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and 2D). The hexamer pore would be wide enough for a sphere of ∼12 Å diameter to pass. In summary, the high degree of structural similarity of Nos Rca to plant Rca supports the identification of Nos Rca as a Rubisco activase. Thus, Nos Rca serves as a model to understand the mechanism of plant Rca.
To understand the mechanism of Nos Rca, we sought to capture Nos Rca in the process of remodeling the inhibited Rubisco by cryo-EM. We incubated CABP-inhibited Nos Rubisco (ECM.CABP) with excess Nos RcaΔC in the presence of ATP, followed after 10 s by addition of the slowly hydrolyzing ATP analog, ATPγS, a nucleotide replacement strategy ( Dong et al., 2019 24. Dong, Y. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Wu, Z. ... Cryo-EM structures and dynamics of substrate-engaged human 26S proteasome Nature. 2019; 565 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A; STAR Methods ). Cryo-EM analysis and single-particle reconstruction yielded one predominant conformation of the Nos RcaΔC:Rubisco complex ( Figures S3 A–S3C). We obtained an EM density map with an overall resolution of ∼2.86 Å ( Figures S3 C and S3D; Table S3 ), and an overall resolution of the Rubisco-subtracted Nos RcaΔC of ∼3.29 Å ( Figures S3 C and S3E). Nos RcaΔC docks onto one corner of the cube-shaped Rubisco ( Figure 3 B; Video S1 ). The cis surface of the hexamer ( Figure 2 D) faces Rubisco, with the N-terminal α/β subdomains and the central pore positioned approximately over one substrate binding pocket of an antiparallel RbcL dimer (RbcL-A and RbcL-B; Figure 3 B). The engaged catalytic site is in an open conformation with no discernable density for the inhibitor CABP, while the bound CABP was well resolved in all other binding pockets ( Figure S4 A). Thus, the interaction captured in the cryo-EM structure represents the end point of Nos Rca remodeling before dissociation from Rubisco.

Nos Rca:Rubisco Complex, Related to Figures 3, 5, S3, S4, and S5
A key feature of the complex was the presence of well-defined density in the Nos RcaΔC hexamer pore, fitting to a 13-residue peptide in an extended conformation ( Figure 3 C; Video S1 ). This finding suggested a mechanism similar to that of red-type proteobacterial Rca, which engages the flexible C terminus of RbcL ( Bhat et al., 2017a 10. Bhat, J.Y. ∙ Miličić, G. ∙ Thieulin-Pardo, G. ... Mechanism of enzyme repair by the AAA+ chaperone Rubisco activase Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :744-756.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mueller-Cajar et al., 2011 58. Mueller-Cajar, O. ∙ Stotz, M. ∙ Wendler, P. ... Structure and function of the AAA+ protein CbbX, a red-type Rubisco activase Nature. 2011; 479 :194-199 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the C-terminal sequence of RbcL-B was resolved up to residue Glu471 in the Rubisco structure, with only six residues (residues 472–477) missing in the EM density ( Figures S4 B and S4C), thus excluding engagement of the C terminus by the Nos Rca central pore. Strikingly, we found that the N-terminal sequence of subunit RbcL-A residues Ser2 to Tyr14 fit into the peptide density spanning the pore ( Figure 3 C). The next resolved N-terminal residue on RbcL-A was Thr24, with residues 15–23 connecting to the peptide in the pore being disordered ( Figures S4 B and S4D). In all other RbcL subunits, the first ordered N-terminal residue is Gly13. We noted that the N-terminal sequence of Nos RbcL consists of alternating small and bulky side chains ( Figure 3 C). Interestingly, this pattern is conserved at the N terminus of green-type form IB RbcL ( Tabita et al., 2008 92. Tabita, F.R. ∙ Satagopan, S. ∙ Hanson, T.E. ... Distinct form I, II, III, and IV Rubisco proteins from the three kingdoms of life provide clues about Rubisco evolution and structure/function relationships J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59 :1515-1524 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ) of plants, green algae, and other cyanobacteria ( Figure S4 E).
To test the functional importance of the RbcL N terminus for reactivation, we generated a truncated Nos Rubisco mutant lacking the first 12 residues ( Nos L 8 S 8 ΔN) ( Figure S1 A). Nos L 8 S 8 ΔN exhibited wild-type carboxylation activity but could no longer be reactivated by Nos Rca upon inhibition with CABP ( Figure 3 D). To determine whether this mechanism is conserved in plants, we produced the analogous N-terminal RbcL truncation in Rubisco of N. tabacum ( Nt L 8 S 8 ΔN) by recombinant expression in the presence of chloroplast chaperonins and assembly factors ( Aigner et al., 2017 2. Aigner, H. ∙ Wilson, R.H. ∙ Bracher, A. ... Plant RuBisCo assembly in E. coli with five chloroplast chaperones including BSD2 Science. 2017; 358 :1272-1278 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2019 51. Lin, M.T. ∙ Stone, W.D. ∙ Chaudhari, V. ... Enzyme kinetics of tobacco Rubisco expressed in Escherichia coli varies depending on the small subunit composition bioRxiv. 2019; Google Scholar ; Wilson et al., 2019 104. Wilson, R.H. ∙ Thieulin-Pardo, G. ∙ Hartl, F.U. ... Improved recombinant expression and purification of functional plant Rubisco FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 :611-621 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A; STAR Methods ). Nt L 8 S 8 ΔN was carboxylation active but the RuBP-inhibited enzyme (E.RuBP) could not be reactivated by Nt Rca in contrast to wild-type Rubisco ( Figures 3 E and S1 A; STAR Methods ). Thus, consistent with their high structural homology, engagement of the N-terminal RbcL sequence is important for remodeling by both Nos Rca and plant Rca.
The Rubisco-bound Nos RcaΔC hexamer adopted a right-handed helical “split-washer” conformation, with subunit 1 (Rca1; yellow) located at the bottom and Rca6 (blue) at the top of the spiral ( Figure 4 A). Nucleotide density was present in all six nucleotide binding pockets of Nos Rca, ADP at the Rca1-Rca2 interface, and ATP (or ATPgγS) in the other sites ( Figure S5 A). The ATP/ATPγS was positioned close to the well-resolved side chains of the arginine residues Arg169 and/or Arg172 from the subsequent subunit ( Figure S5 A). These arginines have been implicated in ATP-hydrolysis in other AAA+ proteins, functioning as the so-called “arginine fingers” ( Puchades et al., 2020 72. Puchades, C. ∙ Sandate, C.R. ∙ Lander, G.C. The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :43-58 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). The EM density of both arginines is less well defined at the Rca6-Rca1 interface, the split ends of the Nos Rca spiral ( Figure S5 A), perhaps reflecting mixed conformations due to ongoing ATP hydrolysis.
The three pore-loops, PL1 (residues 67–72), PL2 (residues 105–119), and PL3 (residues 160–165) ( Data S2 ) were resolved in all Nos Rca subunits ( Figures S5 B–S5D), adopting a staircase arrangement. Close examination of the bound peptide revealed that the small side chains of RbcL-A residues Ala4, Thr6, Thr8, and Thr10 point into successive binding pockets in the central pore formed between PL1 and PL2 of adjacent subunits Rca2 to Rca6 ( Figures 4 B, S5 B, and S5C). The ADP-bound Rca1 is the only subunit not in contact with the peptide. The bulkier side chains of Gln5, Lys7, Gln9, and Lys11 point into the pore solvent channel ( Figure 4 B). Note that Ser2 and Tyr3, protruding from the trans side of the pore, also conform to this pattern of alternating small and bulky side chains, while the pattern does not continue beyond residue 12 ( Figure S4 E).
The bound peptide buries a substantial surface area of 1,018 Å 2 on Nos Rca. The contacts are mediated by van der Waals interactions from both PL1 and PL2 ( Figure 4 C). In addition, the peptide backbone is in hydrogen bond distance to the carbonyl group of Pro69 of PL1 in Rca3 to Rca6 ( Figures 4 C and S5 E). Interestingly, the highly conserved aromatic residue Tyr116 in PL2, which is essential in plant Rca (Tyr188 in Nt Rca) ( Stotz et al., 2011 90. Stotz, M. ∙ Mueller-Cajar, O. ∙ Ciniawsky, S. ... Structure of green-type Rubisco activase from tobacco Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1366-1370 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Data S2 ), does not contact the peptide ( Figure S5 F). In the ATP-bound subunits Rca2 to Rca6, the hydroxyl group of Tyr116 is in hydrogen bond distance to the amide of Phe110 in the same subunit, and to Gln121 in the subsequent subunit, resulting in a network of interactions that rigidify the central pore ( Figure S5 G). In contrast, the position of Tyr116 is ill-defined in the ADP-bound Rca1 ( Figure S5 F). PL3, which does not contact the bound peptide ( Figure S5 D), is positioned between the nucleotide binding site and PL2, suggesting that it may be involved in allosteric regulation via the spatially adjacent Arg169 and Arg172.
Beyond engaging the RbcL N-terminal sequence, Nos Rca contacts Rubisco at three regions covering a total of 1,445 Å 2 ( Figures 5 A–5E; Video S1 ). Interface I (419 Å 2 ) is formed between Rca5/Rca6 and RbcL-A and has high surface shape complementarity ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Rca5 residues Leu244 and Asn248 of the specificity helix H9, as well as Leu250 and Rca6 residues Val91 and Gly93 make van der Waals contacts with Glu52, Ile88, Pro90, Pro92, and Asp95 of RbcL-A ( Figure 5 B). Arg92 in helix α3 of Rca6 forms a salt bridge with Glu52 of RbcL-A, and an intramolecular van der Waals interaction with Glu57 ( Figure 5 B). Interfaces II and III involve the α4-β4 loop of Rca1 and Rca2, respectively ( Figures 5 C–5E). In interface II (600 Å 2 ), subunit Rca1 inserts between the RbcL-A and RbcL-B antiparallel dimer ( Figure 5 C). The conformation of the protruding α4-β4 loop is rigidified by an intramolecular salt bridge between Arg83 and Asp144, with Pro140 having a further stabilizing effect on the loop. The α4-β4 loop contacts Trp67, which is part of the substrate binding pocket and is located in the 60s loop (residues 60–69) of RbcL-A. In addition, Tyr143 of Rca1 makes van der Waals contacts with Gln46, Lys129, and Ala130 of RbcL-A ( Figure 5 C). Note that there is also a steric interaction between Val91 of Rca1 and the C-terminal residues Ile466 and Lys467 of RbcL-B, which may contribute to keep the substrate pocket open for unhindered inhibitor release ( Figure 5 C). In interface III (426 Å 2 ) the α4-β4 loop of Rca2 contacts the RbcS subunits J and P ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Specifically, Tyr143 of Rca2 engages in van der Waals interactions with the β1-α2 loop (K57–F61) of RbcS-J and Met1 of RbcS-P ( Figure 5 E). Residues Arg92, Gly93, and Asn248 of interface I, as well as Pro140 and Tyr143 of interface II/III, are conserved in plant Rca ( Data S1 ), providing additional support for a conserved mechanism of remodeling of green-type form IB Rubisco.
Next, we performed a mutational analysis of Nos RcaΔC to test the functional significance of these interactions. The mutant proteins preserved the hexameric state ( Table S1 ). The interface I mutants V91E/R92G/G93N (breaking the Arg92-Glu52 salt bridge and the van der Waals interactions with Ile88 and Pro90) and L244D/N248A/L250A (disrupting the interaction with Asp95 and Pro92) preserved wild-type ATPase activity but failed to reactivate the CABP-inhibited Rubisco ( Figures 5 F and S1 A). The interface II/III mutant P140G/Y143A/D144A (disrupting the interaction of the α4-β4 loop with Rubisco and destabilizing the loop) also abolished reactivation but additionally showed a ∼70% reduced ATPase activity ( Figures 5 F and S1 A). Note that the mutated residues are distant from the ATPase site, suggesting an indirect effect. Mutational analyses of plant Rca have also implicated residues in helix α3, helix α9 (H9), and the α4-β4 loop in the interaction with Rubisco ( Li et al., 2005 50.

USA. 2019; 116 :24041-24048 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), supporting the functional significance of the structurally defined interface regions in the Nos RcaΔC:Rubisco complex.
How does Nos Rca remodel Rubisco? The Nos RcaΔC:Rubisco complex represents a post-remodeling state, as the Rubisco substrate binding pocket that is engaged by Rca is in an open conformation with no inhibitor bound ( Figure S4 A). Super-position of the open and closed conformations of the substrate binding pockets revealed the structural changes effected by Nos Rca ( Figure 5 G): (1) the N-terminal residues 15–23 of RbcL-A are disordered but are well resolved in all other subunits, suggesting that binding the N-terminal sequence (residues 2–14) in the Rca pore destabilizes this region; (2) as a consequence, the 60s loop of RbcL-A, which contributes to stabilizing the substrate binding pocket, is displaced ( Figure 5 G); (3) in addition, the Rca hexamer—with the bulk of Rca1 α4-β4 loop acting as a wedge—displaces the C-terminal peptide of the adjacent RbcL subunit from its closed position over the substrate pocket (RbcL-B) ( Video S2 ), thereby disrupting its interaction with loop 6. As a result, loop 6 is retracted from its closed position over the substrate pocket ( Figure 5 G). The combined displacement of the 60s loop and loop 6, both of which point to the solvent in the post-remodeling state, results in the complete opening of the substrate binding site, facilitating inhibitor release.

Remodeling of Inhibited Rubisco by Nos Rca, Related to Figure 5, S4, and S5
A distinguishing feature of the Nos Rca subunit is the presence of the C-terminal SSUL domain ( Figure 1 A), which is connected to the AAA+ core (residues 2–291) by a ∼35 residue flexible linker. The last common structured residue in the EM density map of all Nos RcaΔC subunits is Asp281. The SSUL domain shares 54%–64% sequence identity with the three SSUL modules of the CcmM protein ( Nos M58) and its shorter variant M35 ( Nos M35) ( Long et al., 2010 52. Long, B.M. ∙ Tucker, L. ∙ Badger, M.R. ... Functional cyanobacterial beta-carboxysomes have an absolute requirement for both long and short forms of the CcmM protein Plant Physiol. 2010; 153 :285-293 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). The SSUL modules of CcmM function to concentrate Rubisco into a dense condensate prior to encapsulation into the β-carboxysome ( Ryan et al., 2019 79. Ryan, P. ∙ Forrester, T.J.B. ∙ Wroblewski, C. ... The small RbcS-like domains of the β-carboxysome structural protein CcmM bind RubisCO at a site distinct from that binding the RbcS subunit J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :2593-2603 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it seemed plausible that the SSUL domains recruit Nos Rca into the Rubisco condensate ( Lechno-Yossef et al., 2020 48. Lechno-Yossef, S. ∙ Rohnke, B.A. ∙ Belza, A.C.O. ... Cyanobacterial carboxysomes contain an unique rubisco-activase-like protein New Phytol. 2020; 225 :793-806 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, while in M58 and M35 three to five SSUL modules are linked to provide the multi-valency for Rubisco network formation, in Nos Rca each subunit of the hexamer carries its own SSUL, presumably generating high avidity for Rubisco.
The crystal structure of Nos Rca - SSUL ( Nos SSUL, residues 325–414; Figure 6 A), solved by MAD at 1.4 Å resolution ( Figures 6 B, S6 B, and S6C; Table S2 ), confirmed the high degree of similarity to the structure of the SSUL1 module in CcmM of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 ( Se SSUL) (rmsd 1.02–1.04 Å for matching Cα positions) ( Figure S6 D). Like Se SSUL, Nos SSUL contains a disulfide bond (Cys363 to Cys380) in the crystal ( Figure 6 B). The redox state of Se SSUL has been shown to regulate the affinity for Rubisco in condensate formation, with higher affinity in the reducing cytosol and lower affinity in the oxidizing carboxysome interior ( Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To investigate whether Nos Rca interacts with Rubisco in a manner similar to Se CcmM, we used a turbidity assay to monitor Rubisco network formation ( Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). We incubated Rubisco (0.25 µM hexadecamer) with increasing concentrations of reduced Nos Rca (re Nos Rca; 0.125 to 1.0 µM hexamer) ( Figures 6 C and S6 E). Turbidity at 340 nm developed within minutes dependent on Nos Rca concentration ( Figure 6 C), consistent with a recent report for the Rca-like protein from Fremyella diplosiphon ( Lechno-Yossef et al., 2020 48. Lechno-Yossef, S. ∙ Rohnke, B.A. ∙ Belza, A.C.O. ... Cyanobacterial carboxysomes contain an unique rubisco-activase-like protein New Phytol. 2020; 225 :793-806 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). No turbidity was observed with Nos RcaΔC ( Figure 6 C), indicating that the interaction with Rubisco is mediated by the SSUL domains. re Nos Rca displayed an apparent affinity ( 𝐾 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 𝐷 ) for Rubisco of ∼0.4 μM, similar to the previously analyzed interaction of reduced CcmM ( Se M35) with Rubisco (∼0.2 μM) ( Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, incubation of oxidized Nos Rca (ox Nos Rca) with Rubisco resulted in only low turbidity ( Figure 6 C), precluding estimation of apparent binding affinity ( Figure 6 D). Note that ox Nos Rca also formed ring complexes and was functionally active ( Figures S6 F and S6G). Cryo-EM analysis resolved the interaction of re Nos Rca with Rubisco mediated by Nos SSUL at 8.2 Å resolution ( Figures S7 A–S7D). Docking of the Nos SSUL crystal structure and the Nos Rubisco model into the low-resolution EM density map revealed that the SSUL module binds close to the equatorial region of the hexadecamer in a groove between RbcL dimers ( Figure S7 E), as previously shown for the Se M35-Rubisco complex ( Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, addition of ATPγS to re Nos Rca resulted in enhanced turbidity with Rubisco ( Figure 6 E). However, this effect was still completely SSUL-dependent ( Figure 6 E), suggesting that the AAA+ core modulates the interaction by contributing additional valency. Consistent with such an enhancing effect, addition of ATPγS also resulted in observable binding of 0.5 µM ox Nos Rca to Rubisco ( Figure 6 E).
To determine whether Nos Rca and Rubisco can undergo demixing into phase separated droplets, we N-terminally labeled Rubisco with Alexa Fluor 532 (Rubisco-A532) and Nos Rca (re Nos Rca, ox Nos Rca, or Nos RcaΔC) with Alexa Fluor 405 (see STAR Methods ). Upon incubation of re Nos Rca with Rubisco (labeled:unlabeled 1:10) in the presence of ATPγS, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) into fluorescent droplets was readily observed ( Figure 6 F). Consistent with the turbidity measurements, only very small droplets were observed with ox Nos Rca ( Figure 6 G). No droplet formation occurred with Nos RcaΔC and Rubisco ( Figure 6 H). The phenomenon of LLPS observed in vitro indicates that Nos Rca engages in multivalent interactions with Rubisco.
To assess whether the AAA+ core of NosRca contributes directly to LLPS, we generated a mutant of Nos Rca with disrupted interface I (mutations V91E/R92G/G93N and L244D/N248A/L250A combined) ( Nos Rca-IF mut ). re Nos Rca-IF mut was a stable hexamer in solution ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ). The ability of re Nos Rca-IF mut to induce Rubisco condensate formation was strongly reduced ( Figure 6 I), and only very small droplets were observed, despite the presence of the SSUL domains ( Figure 6 J). Thus, both the SSUL domains and the AAA+ core contribute critical valency to ensure packaging of Nos Rca into carboxysomes together with Rubisco.

Section: Discussion

Our structural and functional analysis of cyanobacterial Nos Rca, a close homolog of plant Rca, revealed a mechanism of metabolic repair for form 1B Rubisco that differs from the previously described mechanism of the proteobacterial red-type Rs Rca ( Bhat et al., 2017b 11.

Structure and function of the AAA+ protein CbbX, a red-type Rubisco activase Nature. 2011; 479 :194-199 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nos Rca, like Rs Rca, docks onto inhibitor-bound Rubisco with its hexamer pore positioned over one of the eight catalytic sites. In contrast to Rs Rca, which engages the extended RbcL C terminus ( Bhat et al., 2017a 10. Bhat, J.Y. ∙ Miličić, G. ∙ Thieulin-Pardo, G. ... Mechanism of enzyme repair by the AAA+ chaperone Rubisco activase Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :744-756.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), Nos Rca is rotated clockwise by ∼50 degrees and binds the RbcL N terminus (residues 2–14) in its central pore ( Figure 7 A). The cryo-EM structure of the complex apparently represents an end state of the remodeling cycle. Presumably, ATP-dependent peptide threading comes to a halt when this stably locked position is reached, with the staggered pore-loops PL1 and PL2 of adjacent Rca subunits providing binding pockets for sequence-specific peptide capture. As suggested for other AAA+ proteins, peptide threading may be mediated by sequential ATP hydrolysis around the hexamer ring ( de la Peña et al., 2018 23. de la Peña, A.H. ∙ Goodall, E.A. ∙ Gates, S.N. ...

Insertion of the RbcL N terminus into the Rca central pore is likely of general relevance in organisms with green-type form 1B Rubisco (cyanobacteria, green algae, and plants). Note that in plant Rca the mechanism of reactivation may be modulated by a flexible N-terminal domain of ∼60 residues, not present in Nos Rca ( Esau et al., 1996 27. Esau, B.D. ∙ Snyder, G.W. ∙ Portis, Jr., A.R. Differential effects of N- and C-terminal deletions on the two activities of rubisco activase Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326 :100-105 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stotz et al., 2011 90. Stotz, M. ∙ Mueller-Cajar, O. ∙ Ciniawsky, S. ... Structure of green-type Rubisco activase from tobacco Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1366-1370 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Why have distinct Rca mechanisms of reactivation, employing N- or C-terminal interaction, evolved for green- and red-type Rubisco proteins, considering that the catalytic site is essentially conserved? Upon binding of RuBP, the Rubisco active site is closed by both the 60s loop from the N-terminal domain of one RbcL subunit and loop 6 of the C-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit. The N-terminal sequence pins down the 60s loop and the C terminus stretches over loop 6, generating the solvent-sealed environment required for catalysis. Nos RbcL and Nt RbcL lack the extended C terminus of red-type RbcL (∼12 residues) and have only 2 and 4 residues, respectively, beyond the conserved Asp (D474 in Nos RbcL) that forms a critical attachment point to stably close the catalytic site ( Duff et al., 2000 25. Duff, A.P. ∙ Andrews, T.J. ∙ Curmi, P.M. The transition between the open and closed states of rubisco is triggered by the inter-phosphate distance of the bound bisphosphate J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298 :903-916 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, pulling on the flexible N terminus has evolved as an alternative means for Rca to open the catalytic pocket of inhibitor-bound form IB Rubisco.
The complex of Nos RcaΔC with inhibitor-bound Rubisco, stabilized by a nucleotide substitution strategy, represents a post-remodeling state in which the substrate binding site under repair is open and the inhibitor released. In addition to insertion of the N terminus of one RbcL (RbcL-A) into the Rca hexamer pore, destabilization of the binding pocket involves extensive interactions with Rubisco via three interface regions ( Figure 7 B). Underscoring the sequence homology to plant Rca, critical residues of these interfaces are conserved ( Data S1 ). Interface I formed by Rca5/Rca6 with RbcL-A includes the specificity helix H9 on Rca5 and the βC-βD loop on RbcL ( Figure 7 C). In plants, helix H9 functions in distinguishing Rubisco proteins from solanaceae and non-solanaceae ( Portis et al., 2008 69. Portis, Jr., A.R. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Wang, D. ... Regulation of Rubisco activase and its interaction with Rubisco J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59 :1597-1604 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wachter et al., 2013 98. Wachter, R.M. ∙ Salvucci, M.E. ∙ Carmo-Silva, A.E. ... Activation of interspecies-hybrid Rubisco enzymes to assess different models for the Rubisco-Rubisco activase interaction Photosynth. Res. 2013; 117 :557-566 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the RbcL residues Pro89 and Asp94, which mediate Rca specificity in non-solanaceous plants (e.g., A. thaliana and Spinacia oleracea ), are conserved in Nos RbcL (Pro90 and Asp95) ( Li et al., 2005 50. Li, C. ∙ Salvucci, M.E. ∙ Portis, Jr., A.R. Two residues of rubisco activase involved in recognition of the Rubisco substrate J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :24864-24869 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ott et al., 2000 62. Ott, C.M. ∙ Smith, B.D. ∙ Portis, Jr., A.R. ... Activase region on chloroplast ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Nonconservative substitution in the large subunit alters species specificity of protein interaction J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :26241-26244 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 C). Pro90 contacts the Nos Rca backbone at Val91 and Gly93 in the α3-β3 loop of Rca6. This loop is one residue shorter in plant Rca ( Data S1 and S2 ). Asp95 in Nos RbcL makes van der Waals contacts to Leu244 in helix H9 of Nos Rca5 ( Figure 7 C). Modeling of the At Rca:Rubisco complex based on the Nos Rca:Rubisco structure suggests that Asp94 in At RbcL is in electrostatic interaction with Lys313 in At Rca (the residue equivalent to Leu244 in Nos Rca) ( Figure 7 C). This interaction mediates the Rca-Rubisco specificity of non-solanaceous plants, consistent with previous mutational analyses ( Li et al., 2005 50. Li, C. ∙ Salvucci, M.E. ∙ Portis, Jr., A.R.

Regulation of Rubisco activase and its interaction with Rubisco J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59 :1597-1604 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). In tobacco, a solanaceous plant, this electrostatic interaction is reversed, with Lys94 on Nt RbcL interacting with Asp316 in Nt Rca ( Figure 7 C), and the charge reversal switching the specificity from non-solanaceous to solanaceous ( Portis et al., 2008 69. Portis, Jr., A.R. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Wang, D. ... Regulation of Rubisco activase and its interaction with Rubisco J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59 :1597-1604 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another conserved interaction in interface I is the salt bridge Arg92 in Nos Rca6 with Glu52 in RbcL, which is equivalent to the salt bridges of Lys161 to Glu51 and Lys164 to Glu51 in A. thaliana and tobacco, respectively ( Figure 7 C).
Interfaces II and III involve the α4-β4 loop of Rca1 and Rca2. In interface II, the α4-β4 loop of Rca1 inserts between the RbcL-A and RbcL-B subunits of the antiparallel dimer containing the catalytic site under repair. In interface III, the α4-β4 loop of Rca2 makes contact with RbcS subunits J and P. As a result of these combined interactions, the catalytic site is converted to a completely open state. Specifically, the N-terminal tail and the 60s loop of RbcL-A and the C-terminal tail and loop 6 of the adjacent RbcL-B subunit are displaced ( Figure 7 D). The interaction of Nos Rca with RbcS is intriguing. RbcS contributes indirectly to stabilizing the sugar substrate in the catalytic site pocket ( Bracher et al., 2011 14. Bracher, A. ∙ Starling-Windhof, A. ∙ Hartl, F.U. ... Crystal structure of a chaperone-bound assembly intermediate of form I Rubisco Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :875-880 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thus the interaction with Nos Rca, in addition to providing an anchoring point, may also prevent dissociation of RbcS while the catalytic site is being destabilized.
Another important feature of Nos Rca is the presence of a Rubisco SSUL domain flexibly attached to the C terminus of the AAA+ core in each Rca subunit. As shown for the Rca-like protein of Fremyella diplosiphon ( Lechno-Yossef et al., 2020 48. Lechno-Yossef, S. ∙ Rohnke, B.A. ∙ Belza, A.C.O. ... Cyanobacterial carboxysomes contain an unique rubisco-activase-like protein New Phytol. 2020; 225 :793-806 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), these SSUL domains mediate an alternative mode of interaction with Rubisco to ensure that Nos Rca becomes encapsulated with Rubisco during carboxysome biogenesis. They bind into a groove close to the equatorial region of Rubisco between the RbcL dimer units, as shown for the SSUL domains of the carboxysomal scaffolding protein CcmM ( Ryan et al., 2019 79. Ryan, P. ∙ Forrester, T.J.B. ∙ Wroblewski, C. ... The small RbcS-like domains of the β-carboxysome structural protein CcmM bind RubisCO at a site distinct from that binding the RbcS subunit J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :2593-2603 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nos SSUL also contains the cysteine pair previously described for the SSUL module in CcmM ( Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), and thus its interaction with Rubisco is redox regulated, resulting in reduced affinity under oxidizing conditions.
In contrast to CcmM, which contains three to five SSUL modules as a linear fusion, Nos Rca contains six separate SSUL modules, one on each subunit, providing multi-valency for Rubisco binding ( Figure 7 E). Interestingly, we found that the AAA+ core of Nos Rca contributes critical additional valency. Thus, the seemingly unrelated interactions of Nos Rca in Rubisco repair and binding to Rubisco via the SSUL domains are linked and must cooperate to ensure Rca packing into carboxysomes ( Figure 7 E). Upon transfer into the oxidizing environment of the carboxysome, the SSUL-mediated association would then be released in favor of the functional interaction for Rubisco repair via the AAA+ core. It will be interesting to understand the interplay of Nos Rca and CcmM during carboxysome biogenesis.
The acquisition of the SSUL domain by the NosRca AAA+ core probably occurred in the context of the appearance of carboxysomes about 350 million years ago, long after the primary endosymbiotic event leading to the evolution of chloroplasts ( Rae et al., 2013 73. Rae, B.D. ∙ Long, B.M. ∙ Badger, M.R. ...

E. coli DH5α (ThermoFisher) were used for the amplification of plasmid DNA. Positive clones were selected and cultivated in LB medium at 37°C for 12 h. Both E. coli BL21 STAR and BL21 (DE3) (ThermoFisher) were used for recombinant protein production. Culture conditions for protein expression are provided in ‘Method Details’.
The cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (Culture Collection of Algae) was used to obtain genomic DNA for the cloning of Nostoc genes encoding groES-EL , rbcL-X-S and rca . Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 was cultured in BG-11 medium at 30°C and 50 rpm in continuous light.
The oligos used for amplification and generation of plasmid are listed in Table S4 .
Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 cells cultured to high density (1 ml) were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 x g for 10 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mL buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0/50 mM NaCl) and cells lysed by 5 cycles of heating (3 min at 95°C) and snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. The lysate was centrifuged (20,000 x g for 10 min) and 1 µL of supernatant was used as template in PCR reactions. The groES-EL operon was amplified using oligos 25/26, the rbcL-X-S operon using oligos 33/34 and the rca gene using oligos 49/50 ( Table S4 ). The final plasmids were assembled by PCR and Gibson assembly as described below.
pET11a- Nos GroSEL was generated by amplifying the groES-groEL operon by PCR from genomic DNA of Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 ( Nos GroSEL) and cloning into the pET11a vector via Gibson assembly. The Rubisco genes from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 ( NosrbcL and NosrbcS ) were also amplified from genomic DNA by PCR and inserted into the pET28b vector. The His 6 -ubiquitin tag (H 6 ubi) was amplified from the pHUE plasmid ( Baker et al., 2005 7. Baker, R.T. ∙ Catanzariti, A.M. ∙ Karunasekara, Y. ... Using deubiquitylating enzymes as research tools Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398 :540-554 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Catanzariti et al., 2004 17.

An efficient system for high-level expression and easy purification of authentic recombinant proteins Protein Sci. 2004; 13 :1331-1339 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inserted as a N-terminal fusion to NosrbcLS to obtain pET28b-H 6 ubi- Nos LS. Finally, H 6 ubi- Nos LS was inserted C-terminally into pET11a- Nos GroSEL to obtain pET11a- Nos GroSEL-H 6 ubi- Nos LS. The N-terminal deletion mutant pET11a- Nos GroSEL-H 6 ubi- Nos LΔN12-S was generated by deleting the first 12 residues (MSYAQTKTQTKS) at the N terminus of Nos RbcL by PCR. The plasmid pET11a- At Cpn60αβ- At Cpn20- Nt RbcL, a kind gift from the group of M.R. Hanson ( Lin et al., 2019 51. Lin, M.T. ∙ Stone, W.D. ∙ Chaudhari, V. ... Enzyme kinetics of tobacco Rubisco expressed in Escherichia coli varies depending on the small subunit composition bioRxiv. 2019; Google Scholar ), was modified to generate pET11a- At Cpn60αβ- At Cpn20-H 6 ubi- Nt RbcLΔN9 by deletion of the first nine N-terminal residues (PQTETKASV) of Nt RbcL ( Nt RbcLΔN9), and subsequently introducing the His 6 -ubiquitin tag (H 6 ubi) from the pHUE plasmid as a N-terminal fusion to Nt RbcLΔN9 (H 6 ubi- Nt RbcLΔN9).
pHUE- Nos Rca was generated by amplification of the rca gene from genomic DNA (Nostoc sp. PCC 7120) and subsequent cloning of residues 2-414 into the pHUE vector by using the SacII and EcoRI restriction sites. To generate pHUE- Nos RcaΔC, residues 292 and 293 in pHUE- Nos Rca were changed to two consecutive stop codons by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutations in pHUE- Nos Rca and pHUE- Nos RcaΔC were introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent) resulting in the following constructs: pHUE- Nos Rca mutant (V91E/R92G/G93N/L244D/N248A/L250A); pHUE - Nos RcaΔC (V91E/R92G/G93N); pHUE - Nos RcaΔC (P140G/Y143A/D144A); pHUE - Nos RcaΔC (L244D/N248A/L250A).
pHUE- Nos Rca-SSUL was generated by cloning residues 325-414 (SSUL domain) of Nos Rca into the pHUE plasmid by PCR, and subsequent Gibson assembly (NEB).
Nt Rubisco from Nicotiana tabacum leaves and Nt Rca(R294V) recombinantly expressed in E. coli , were purified as previously described ( Servaites, 1985 82. Servaites, J.C. Crystalline ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of high integrity and catalytic activity from Nicotiana tabacum Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238 :154-160 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Stotz et al., 2011 90. Stotz, M. ∙ Mueller-Cajar, O. ∙ Ciniawsky, S. ...

Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm.
E. coli BL21, harboring arabinose-inducible pBAD33- Ec GroSEL and pHUE- Nos Rca plasmids, was used for the expression and purification of Nos RcaΔC (residues 2-291) as a H 6 -ubiquitin (H 6 Ubi) fusion protein. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37°C/180 rpm until OD 600 0.3-0.4. The chaperonin GroES/EL was induced by addition of 1% (w/v) L-arabinose. Two h after induction, the temperature was reduced to 18°C and expression of H 6 Ubi- Nos RcaΔC was induced by addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 20 h. Cells were resuspended in ethanolamine (ETA) lysis buffer (50 mM ETA pH 8.0/300 mM NaCl/10 mM imidazole/5% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 1 g L -1 lysozyme and 5 U mL -1 benzonase, and lysed by sonication (15 × 15 s bursts with 75 s intermissions on ice). The supernatant obtained after high speed centrifugation (20 000 x g for 30 min at 4°C) was loaded on a gravity-flow nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal affinity column (QIAGEN), washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of ETA lysis buffer pH 9.2 containing 25 mM imidazole, and the protein eluted with ETA lysis buffer pH 9.2/200 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and the H 6 Ubi moiety was cleaved by Usp2 ( Baker et al., 2005 7. Baker, R.T. ∙ Catanzariti, A.M. ∙ Karunasekara, Y. ... Using deubiquitylating enzymes as research tools Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398 :540-554 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Catanzariti et al., 2004 17.

An efficient system for high-level expression and easy purification of authentic recombinant proteins Protein Sci. 2004; 13 :1331-1339 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 4°C overnight. After dialysis against 50 mM ETA pH 9.2/10 mM NaCl, Nos RcaΔC was loaded on a Mono Q HR 16/10 column (GE). The protein was eluted with a 10 CV gradient (0.01 – 0.5 M NaCl), concentrated and applied to a size-exclusion chromatography column (Superdex 200 10/300 GL; GE) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0/50 mM NaCl/5 mM MgCl 2 . Fractions containing the Nos RcaΔC were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin MWCO 10000 (GE) and glycerol added to 5% final prior to aliquoting and flash freezing in liquid N 2 . For all other studies the purification strategy was modified as stated below.
Nos SSUL (residues 325-414) was recombinantly expressed in E. coli from the pHUE- Nos Rca - SSUL plasmid as a H 6 Ubi fusion protein. Cells were grown in LB media at 30°C/180 rpm until OD 600 0.3-0.4, and then Nos SSUL expression induced by addition of 0.2 mM IPTG and the cells shifted to 22°C/120 rpm for 18 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in ETA lysis buffer (50 mM ETA pH 9.2/300 mM NaCl/10 mM imidazole/5% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 1 g L -1 lysozyme and 5 U mL -1 benzonase, and lysed by sonication (15 × 15 s bursts with 75 s intermissions on ice). Purification of Nos SSUL was carried out essentially as above for Nos RcaΔC. Subsequent to dialysis after the first Ni-NTA column, Nos SSUL was applied to a second Ni-NTA resin to remove Usp2, H 6 Ubi and any uncleaved protein. The flow through was concentrated and applied to a size-exclusion chromatography column (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75; GE) equilibrated in 50 mM ETA pH 9.2/300 mM NaCl/1 mM DTT/5% glycerol. Fractions containing the Nos SSUL were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin MWCO 3000 (GE), aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid N 2 .
Nos Rca, Nos RcaΔC and mutants were expressed and purified from E. coli BL21 STAR cells harboring arabinose-inducible pBAD33- Ec GroSEL and the respective pHUE plasmid. Briefly, cells were grown in 2xYT media containing 10 mM KCl ( Larimer and Soper, 1993 47. Larimer, F.W. ∙ Soper, T.S. Overproduction of Anabaena 7120 ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase in Escherichia coli Gene. 1993; 126 :85-92 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 37°C/180 rpm until OD 600 0.3-0.4. GroSEL was induced by addition of 0.4% (w/v) L-arabinose. One h after chaperonin induction, the temperature was reduced to 18°C. When the cells had equilibrated to 18°C (∼1 h), induction of protein was started by addition of 0.2 mM IPTG and allowed to proceed for 18 h/120 rpm. Cells were harvested and incubated in buffer A (50 mM MMT pH 8.0/300 mM KCl/10 mM MgCl 2 /5% glycerol) containing 1 g L -1 lysozyme/2.5 U mL -1 / Sm DNase//complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for 1 h prior to lysis using EmulsiFlex C5 (Avestin, Inc). Note MMT is a composite buffer consisting of DL-malic acid, MES monohydrate and Tris base in the molar ratio 1:2:2. After high speed centrifugation (40 000 x g/40 min/4°C) the supernatant was loaded on to a gravity TALON metal affinity column (Takara), equilibrated and washed with 10 CV buffer A/20 mM imidazole. The bound protein was eluted with buffer A pH 8.4/200 mM imidazole, and diluted 3-fold in buffer A containing 5 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS)/10% glycerol/5 mM 2-ME to a final protein concentration < 0.5 g L -1 . The H 6 Ubi moiety was cleaved by Usp2 overnight at 10°C. The cleaved protein was buffer exchanged on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE) to 50 mM MMT pH 8.4/10 mM KCl/5% glycerol, and subsequently loaded on a MonoQ column (GE). The protein was eluted with a 10 CV gradient (0.01 – 0.5 M KCl), concentrated to ∼5 mL and applied onto a size-exclusion chromatography column (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200; GE) equilibrated in buffer B (50 mM MMT pH 8.4/100 mM KCl/10 mM MgCl 2 /5% glycerol). The protein containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin MWCO 3000 (GE), aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid N 2 . To generate reduced Nos Rca (re Nos Rca), 5 mM DTT was added to all buffers after Usp2 cleavage. The oxidized Nos Rca (ox Nos Rca) purified in the absence of DTT was allowed to further air oxidize on ice for 48 h after the final column prior to concentrating, aliquoting and flash freezing.
Nos Rubisco was expressed in E. coli BL21 STAR cells harboring the IPTG-inducible Nostoc chaperonin on pET11a- Nos GroSEL-H 6 ubi- Nos LS plasmid, in which the cleavable H 6 Ubi motif is attached at the N terminus of Nos RbcL. Cells were grown in 2 x YT/10 mM KCl media ( Larimer and Soper, 1993 47. Larimer, F.W. ∙ Soper, T.S. Overproduction of Anabaena 7120 ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase in Escherichia coli Gene. 1993; 126 :85-92 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 37°C/180 rpm until OD 600 0.6 – 0.8. Nos GroES/EL and H 6 ubi- Nos RbcLS were induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG and cells shifted to 22°C at 120 rpm for 22 h. Cells were lysed, cell debris removed and the supernatant loaded onto a TALON resin column as described above. After 10 CV washes in buffer A/20 mM imidazole the H 6 Ubi-tagged Rubisco complex was eluted with buffer A pH 8.4/200 mM imidazole. Usp2-mediated digestion was performed overnight in presence of 5 mM 2-ME at 10°C. After removal of imidazole on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE) equilibrated in buffer A, the buffer-exchanged protein eluate was applied to a TALON resin column for removal of Usp2, the cleaved H 6 Ubi moiety and any uncleaved protein. The flow through was concentrated to ∼5 mL and applied onto a size-exclusion chromatography column as above, equilibrated in buffer B containing 30 mM NaHCO 3 . The Nos Rubisco containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin MWCO 30000 (GE), aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid N 2 .
Nt RubiscoΔN, with 9 residues deleted at the N terminus of the RbcL subunit, was expressed in E. coli BL21 STAR cells harboring the IPTG-inducible plasmids pET11a- At Cpn60αβ- At Cpn20-H 6 ubi-ΔN9 Nt RbcL and pCDF- Nt XSR 1 R 2 B 2 (kind gift from MR Hanson). Cells were grown in 0.1 L ZYP-5052 auto-induction media ( Lin et al., 2019 51. Lin, M.T. ∙ Stone, W.D. ∙ Chaudhari, V. ... Enzyme kinetics of tobacco Rubisco expressed in Escherichia coli varies depending on the small subunit composition bioRxiv. 2019; Google Scholar ; Studier, 2005 91. Studier, F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41 :207-234 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) at 37°C/160 rpm for 6 h and then transferred to 23°C/120 rpm for 22 h. Harvested cells were re-suspended and incubated in buffer A containing 1 g L -1 lysozyme, 2.5 U mL -1 Sm DNase, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for 1 h prior to lysis by sonication. After high speed centrifugation (40 000 x g/40 min/4°C) the supernatant was loaded on a HiTrap (GE) TALON Crude (Takara) metal affinity column, washed with 10 CV of buffer A prior to elution by a 10 CV linear imidazole gradient 0 to 200 mM for separation of H 6 Ubi-tagged Rubisco from At Cpn60αβ. Fractions containing only H 6 Ubi-tagged ΔN9 Nt Rubisco were selected by immunoblotting against Nt RbcL and At Cpn60αβ. The pooled fractions were subjected to digestion by Usp2 (8 h/10°C) in the presence of 5 mM 2-ME. The reaction was then buffer exchanged to 50 mM MMT pH 8.4/100 mM KCl/5% glycerol on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE), and applied to a gravity TALON (Takara) metal affinity column for removal of Usp2, the cleaved H 6 Ubi moiety and any uncleaved protein. The flow through was concentrated by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin MWCO 30000 (GE), aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid N 2 .
2-Carboxyarabinitol-1,5-diposphate (CABP) was synthesized according to ( Pierce et al., 1980 68. Pierce, J. ∙ Tolbert, N.E. ∙ Barker, R. Interaction of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase with transition-state analogues Biochemistry. 1980; 19 :934-942 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 100 µmol RuBP was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of KCN in 5 mL 0.1 M Tris-acetate pH 8.3 for 48 h at 25°C. The racemic mixture of 2-carboxyribitol-1,5-diphosphate (CRBP) and CABP was treated with the cation exchange resin AG50W-X8 (H + ), filtered and freeze-dried. To separate the enantiomers, the lactonized products were dissolved in 3 mM HCl and applied to a 120 mL AG1X8 (Cl - ) column equilibrated in 3 mM HCL, eluted over a 4 L gradient from 0 – 0.4 M LiCl, and then the 50 mL fractions were assayed for total phosphate ( Chifflet et al., 1988 19. Chifflet, S. ∙ Torriglia, A. ∙ Chiesa, R. ... A method for the determination of inorganic phosphate in the presence of labile organic phosphate and high concentrations of protein: application to lens ATPases Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168 :1-4 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ). CABP containing fractions were pooled and reduced to a volume of 50 mL in a rotary evaporator at 30°C. Addition of 3-fold molar excess of barium acetate precipitated the CABP as barium salt (1 h at −20°C). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (5000 x g for 20 min at 4°C) and redissolved by addition of acid-washed AG50W-X8 resin. After filtration, the purified CABP was freeze-dried and redissolved in 50 mM Bicine-NaOH pH 9.3. Complete saponification was ensured by incubation on ice for 24 h, before aliquoting and flash freezing in liquid N 2 .
All assays were performed at 25°C.
CO 2 fixation by Rubisco and Rubisco activase activity were measured as previously described ( Barta et al., 2011 9. Barta, C. ∙ Carmo-Silva, A.E. ∙ Salvucci, M.E.

The carbamylated Rubisco (ECM) was obtained by preincubating Rubisco in 100 mM MMT pH 8.4/60 mM NaHCO 3 /20 mM MgCl 2 for 10 min. The uncarbamylated Rubisco (E) was obtained by buffer exchange of the purified Rubisco into 100 mM MMT pH 8.4/50 mM KCl/4 mM EDTA. The inhibited Nos Rubisco (E.XuBP, E.RuBP and ECM.CABP) and inhibited Nt Rubisco (E.RuBP) were formed by addition of the respective inhibitory sugars and incubation for 30-60 min. Time course experiments were initiated by addition of ECM, ECM.CABP, E, E.RuBP or E.XuBP (0.25 µM active sites) to the reaction assay including RuBP (0.4 mM unless otherwise indicated), Rca and ATP (3 mM) as indicated. The data were fitted in SigmaPlot using the equation Sigmoid, 4 Parameter f = y0+a/(1+exp(-(x-x0)/b)).
Dose dependent reactivation of Nos Rubisco (ECM.CABP) was measured in presence of ATP (3 mM) and at the indicated Nos RcaΔC concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25 µM hexamer). The single time-point experiments for the amount of CO 2 fixed was analyzed at 8 min after initiation of the reaction and conducted in the presence of 1 mM RuBP to ensure steady state kinetics for the ECM control.
To estimate specific activity and account for background counts, corresponding samples were measured in 5 or 6 replicates per assay.
ATP hydrolysis was enzymatically coupled to NADH oxidation and measured spectrophotometrically at 25°C ( Barta et al., 2011 9. Barta, C. ∙ Carmo-Silva, A.E. ∙ Salvucci, M.E.

The assay was started by addition of Nos Rca, Nos RcaΔC, or mutants ( Nos Rca V91E/R92G/G93N/ L244D/N248A/L250A, Nos RcaΔC P140G/Y143A/D144A, Nos RcaΔC V91E/R92G/G93N, Nos RcaΔC L244D/N248A/L250A) at 0.5 µM (hexamer) in assay buffer (100 mM MMT pH 8.4/20 mM KCl/10 mM MgCl 2 /5 mM DTT/2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate/0.3 mM NADH/2 mM ATP/∼30 U mL -1 pyruvate kinase/45 U mL -1 lactic dehydrogenase). ECM and ECM.CABP (0.25 µM hexadecamer) were prepared as described above and added as indicated. To suppress turbidity due to condensate formation of activated or inhibited Rubisco (ECM or ECM.CABP, respectively) in the presence of Nos Rca, the salt concentration was increased to 200 mM KCl in the assay buffer.
Measurements were performed at 25°C in buffer C (50 mM MMT pH 8.4/50 mM KCl/10 mM MgCl 2 ) for ox Nos Rca and in the presence of additional 5 mM DTT for re Nos Rca / Nos RcaΔC /re Nos Rca-IF mut . Reactions (100 µL) containing Rubisco (0.25 mM) and different concentrations of Nos Rca (re Nos Rca or ox Nos Rca) or Nos RcaΔC (0.5 µM) or re Nos Rca-IF mut (0.5 µM) in the absence or presence of 2 mM ATPγS as indicated in the figure legends were mixed rapidly by vortexing, and absorbance at 340 nm was monitored as a function of time on a Jasco V-560 spectrophotometer.
For analysis of LLPS, Rubisco holoenzyme was labeled at the N terminus with the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 532 NHS ester (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturer’s instructions (∼2 dye molecules bound per Rubisco holoenzyme). re Nos Rca, ox Nos Rca, Nos RcaΔC and Nos Rca-IF mut was labeled at the N terminus with the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 405 NHS ester (ThermoFisher) (∼2.2, 2.4, 1.7 and 3 dye molecules bound per Rca hexamer, respectively). Labeled protein was mixed with unlabeled protein, at a ratio of 1:10. Reactions (20 µL) in buffer C containing 5 mM DTT in the presence or absence of 2 mM ATPγS with re Nos Rca, ox Nos Rca, Nos RcaΔC or Nos Rca-IF mut (0.5 µM) and Rubisco (0.25 µM) were incubated for 5 min at 25°C and then transferred to an uncoated chambered coverslip (µ-Slide angiogenesis; Ibidi) for another 5 min before analysis. Images were illuminated with a Lumencor SPECTRA X Light Engine at 398 nm and 558 nm for fluorescence imaging. Images were recorded by focusing on the bottom of the plate using a Leica Thunder Widefield 2 microscope with Leica DFC9000 GTC camera and a HC PL APO 63x/1.47 oil objective.
Purified proteins at 2 mg mL -1 was analyzed using static and dynamic light scattering by auto-injection of the sample onto a SEC column (5 mm, 4.6x300 mm column, Wyatt Technology, product # WTC-030N5) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min -1 in buffer 50 mM MMT pH 8.4/100 mM KCl/10 mM MgCl 2 at 25°C in the presence or absence of nucleotide (1 mM). The column was in line with the following detectors: a variable UV absorbance detector set at 280 nm (Agilent 1100 series), the DAWN EOS MALS detector (Wyatt Technology, 690 nm laser) and the Optilab rEX™ refractive index detector (Wyatt Technology, 690 nm laser) ( Wyatt, 1993 105. Wyatt, P.J. Light scattering and the absolute characterization of macromolecules Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272 :1-40 Crossref Scopus (1202) Google Scholar ). Molecular masses were calculated using the ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology) with the dn/dc value set to 0.185 mL g -1 . Bovine serum albumin (Thermo) was used as the calibration standard.
All cryo-grids were prepared with a Vitrobot Mark 4 (FEI). A volume of 3 µL of the sample was applied to a glow-discharged grid (Quantifoil R2/1 300 mesh) at 25°C and 90% humidity, then semi-automatically blotted and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane.
To capture the interaction between Nos RcaΔC and CABP-inhibited Rubisco ( Nos RcaΔC:Rubisco), Nos Rubisco (1 µM) was first carbamylated by incubation in buffer C containing 10 mM NaHCO 3 for 10 min at 25°C, then inhibited with 8 µM CABP at 25°C for 1 h. The Nos RcaΔC:Rubisco ( Nos RcaΔC:ECM.CABP) complex was formed following a published nucleotide-substitution strategy ( Dong et al., 2019 24. Dong, Y. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Wu, Z. ... Cryo-EM structures and dynamics of substrate-engaged human 26S proteasome Nature. 2019; 565 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, ECM.CABP (0.5 µM) was incubated with Nos RcaΔC (10 µM) at 25°C in the presence of ATP (2 mM) for 10 s, followed by the addition ATPγS (2 mM), and incubated at 25°C for another 10 min before preparing the cryo-grids as stated above. The cryo-grids were initially screened on a Talos Arctica (FEI) transmission electron microscope (TEM). Selected grids were transferred to a Titan Krios 300 kV TEM (FEI) equipped with GIF Quantum Energy Filters (Gatan), and a K3 direct detector (Gatan). 9,042 movies were automatically collected by SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 54. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (1509) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a pixel size of 0.8512 Å. The total exposure time of 2.8 s was divided into 31 frames with an accumulated dose of 60 electrons per Å 2 and a defocus range of −0.7 µm to −2.5 µm.
For Preparing the Nos Rca:Rubisco complex, Nos Rubisco (1.25 µM) was mixed with Nos Rca (15 µM) in buffer C containing 5 mM DTT and cryo-grids prepared as above. The cryo-grids were screened on a Glacios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Scientific), equipped with K2 summit direct electron detector (Gatan), operated at 200 keV. Selected grid on stage was used for data collection directly with K2 summit. Exposure times of 12 s were divided into 40 frames with an accumulated dose of 47 electrons per Å 2 . 1,570 movies were automatically collected by SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 54. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (1509) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a pixel size of 1.885 Å and a defocus range of −1 µm to −4.5 µm.
For the Nos RcaΔC:Rubisco ( Nos RcaΔC:ECM·CABP) dataset, on-the-fly processing during data collection was performed with MotionCorr2 and CTFFIND-4.1, as implemented in the Focus software ( Biyani et al., 2017 12. Biyani, N. ∙ Righetto, R.D. ∙ McLeod, R. ... Focus: The interface between data collection and data processing in cryo-EM J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 198 :124-133 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only micrographs with good particle quality, with an estimated maximum resolution below 5 Å, were kept for further data processing with RELION 3.0. A total of 519,151 particles were auto-picked by Gautomatch ( https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/Gautomatch ) and extracted at a pixel size of 3.4048 Å (four-fold binned). The first round of 2D-classification was used to exclude ice contaminations and classes with no structural features. The selected particles were next refined according to a Rubisco reference converted from the dataset of PDB: 1RBL ( Newman et al., 1993 60. Newman, J. ∙ Branden, C.I. ∙ Jones, T.A. Structure determination and refinement of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Synechococcus PCC6301 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49 :548-560 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), re-centered, and then subjected to a second round of 2D-classification. Free Nos RcaΔC classes were excluded, which resulted in the selection of 106,831 particles ( Figure S3 ). 3D-classification with the Rubisco reference showed only one class of the Nos RcaΔC hexamer in complex with Rubisco, containing 30,607 particles, with a resolution of 8.28 Å. These particles were re-extracted at full resolution (0.8512 Å pixel size) and subjected to “polishing” with RELION to generate “shiny” particles. To deal with multiple Nos RcaΔC hexamers bound per Rubisco, we followed a previously published symmetry-expansion procedure ( Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). In detail, particles were first aligned with D4 symmetry. Then D4 symmetry was released and yielded 8-fold particles by the symmetry-expanding command, relion_particle_symmetry_expand. A focused 3D-classification in Nos RcaΔC with symmetry-released particles revealed one class with Nos RcaΔC hexamer occupancy, comprising of 21,149 particles ( Figure S3 ). These particles generated the final map of the Nos RcaΔC:ECM·CABP complex at 2.86 Å resolution, determined by gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) with a cutoff at 0.143. Particle subtraction of the Rubisco signal improved the alignment accuracy of the Nos RcaΔC hexamer, and generated a local Nos RcaΔC map at 3.29 Å resolution.
The raw movies of the Nos Rca:Rubisco dataset were first processed with MotionCorr2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 106. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (1512) PubMed Google Scholar ) with dose-weighting. CTFFIND-4.1( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 78. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (1029) PubMed Google Scholar ) estimated the CTF parameters for each micrograph. 298,336 Particles were picked by Gautomatch ( https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/Gautomatch ). Two rounds of 2D-classification excluded ice contaminations and classes with no structural features, and resulted in 45,859 clean particles ( Figure S7 ). These particles were used to generate a reference for 3D-classification in RELION 3.0. ( Scheres, 2012 80. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (2056) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the 3D initial model module. 3D-classification revealed one class with detailed Rubisco features with a resolution of 8.28 Å (27,527 particles). To deal with multiple SSUL domains bound per Rubisco, we followed the same symmetry-expansion procedure previously reported ( Wang et al., 2019 100. Wang, H. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Aigner, H. ... Rubisco condensate formation by CcmM in β-carboxysome biogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were first aligned with D4 symmetry. Each asymmetric unit L 2 S 2 SSUL was processed as an individual particle, which is achieved by the symmetry-expanding command, relion_particle_symmetry_expand, and particle subtraction. A focused classification with a SSUL mask resulted in one class of particles with detailed SSUL feature. 32,128 particles from this class were selected and subjected to final local refinement. Post-processing improved the map resolution to 8.2 Å.
Nos RcaΔC:ECM·CABP – Nos RcaΔC model building was initiated by rigid-body fitting the Nos RcaΔC subdomains from the crystal structure into the cryo-EM density, followed by manual editing using Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 26. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (20237) PubMed Google Scholar ). This model was refined in reciprocal space with REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 59. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (4809) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ECM.CABP model was generated with SWISS-MODEL ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 102. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (1867) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the coordinates of Rubisco from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (PDB: 1UZH ) ( Karkehabadi et al., 2005 42. Karkehabadi, S. ∙ Peddi, S.R. ∙ Anwaruzzaman, M. ... Chimeric small subunits influence catalysis without causing global conformational changes in the crystal structure of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase Biochemistry. 2005; 44 :9851-9861 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). This model was placed into the cryo-EM density using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 67. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (19985) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by manual editing using Coot. Residues with disordered side-chains were truncated at C-β. This model was refined in reciprocal space with REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 59. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (4809) PubMed Google Scholar ), using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints.
Nos Rca:Rubisco – First, the crystal structure of thiol-reduced Nos SSUL and the Nos Rubisco model (solved from the Nos RcaΔC:ECM-CABP complex) were placed into the density using Chimera, followed by manual editing using Coot. The resulting model was refined in reciprocal space with REFMAC5, using jelly-body restraints. The used structure factors were calculated from a masked map.
The models and the electron density maps for Nos RcaΔC:Rubisco and Nos Rca:Rubisco have been deposited to the wwPDB database under PDB/EMDB accession codes 6Z1F/EMD-11028 and 6Z1G/EMD-11029, respectively. The local electron density map for Nos RcaΔC in the Nos RcaΔC:Rubisco complex has been deposited under EMDB accession code EMD-11575.
Reduced or oxidized Nos Rca (0.125 µM), in buffer C with or without 5 mM DTT, respectively, was incubated on a glow-discharged grid (Quantifoil Carbon support films 200 mesh) at 25°C for 1 min, then stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Images were recorded on Titan Halo (FEI) equipped with Falcon 3EC Direct Electron Detector (ThermoFisher) with a pixel size of 1.85 Å by SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 54. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (1509) PubMed Google Scholar ). A targeted defocus of −2 µm was obtained by the auto-focus function in SerialEM.
The Nos RcaΔC construct used for crystallization includes residues 2–291. The Nos SSUL construct used for crystallization includes residues 325–414.
Nos RcaΔC – Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 4°C. Drops containing 2 µL of a 1:1 mixture of 4.9 mg mL -1 Nos RcaΔC in buffer 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0/50 mM NaCl/5 mM MgCl 2 and precipitant were equilibrated against 500 µL precipitant. The precipitant contained 2.2 or 2.3 M Na-acetate pH 7.0.
Nos SSUL – Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 4°C. Drops containing 3 µL of a 1:1 mixture of 5.2 mg mL -1 Nos SSUL in buffer 50 mM ETA pH 9.2/300 mM NaCl/1 mM DTT/5% glycerol and precipitant were equilibrated against 500 µL precipitant. The precipitant contained 26% PEG-3350 and 50 mM MES-NaOH pH 6.0.
For cryo-mounting, the crystals were transferred into a cryo-solution that was precipitant containing 15% glycerol in addition and subsequently cryo-cooled by dipping into liquid nitrogen.
Nos RcaΔC – The diffraction data of the crystals of Nos RcaΔC were collected by the oscillation method at beamline X06DA at the Swiss Synchrotron Light Source (SLS) in Villigen, Switzerland. The diffraction data from Nos RcaΔC crystals were integrated with XDS and further processed with POINTLESS ( Evans, 2006 30. Evans, P. Scaling and assessment of data quality Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :72-82 Crossref Scopus (3316) PubMed Google Scholar ), SCALA ( Evans, 1997 29. Evans, P.R. Scala. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter 33 1997 22-24 Google Scholar ) and CTRUNCATE ( French and Wilson, 1978 33. French, G. ∙ Wilson, K. On the treatment of negative intensity observations Acta Crystallogr. A. 1978; 34 :517-525 Crossref Google Scholar ). The structure was solved at 3.4 Å from a Gadolinium (GdCl 3 ) derivative by Gd-multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) using ShelxC/D/E ( Sheldrick, 2010 84. Sheldrick, G.M. Experimental phasing with SHELXC/D/E: combining chain tracing with density modification Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :479-485 Crossref Scopus (836) PubMed Google Scholar ) as implemented in the Hkl2map GUI ( Pape and Schneider, 2004 64. Pape, T. ∙ Schneider, T.R. HKL2MAP: a graphical user interface for phasing with SHELX programs J. Appl. Cryst. 2004; 37 :843-844 Crossref Google Scholar ). The seven Gd sites were refined and phases calculated with SHARP ( de La Fortelle and Bricogne, 1997 22. de La Fortelle, E. ∙ Bricogne, G. [27] Maximum-likelihood heavy-atom parameter refinement for multiple isomorphous replacement and multiwavelength anomalous diffraction methods Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 :472-494 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The map, calculated after density modification with RESOLVE ( Terwilliger, 2000 93. Terwilliger, T.C. Maximum-likelihood density modification Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56 :965-972 Crossref Scopus (1606) PubMed Google Scholar ), assuming a solvent content of 55%, revealed features of secondary structure elements. A preliminary model was auto-built with Buccaneer ( Cowtan, 2006 21. Cowtan, K. The Buccaneer software for automated model building. 1. Tracing protein chains Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :1002-1011 Crossref Scopus (1269) PubMed Google Scholar ), and missing portions added manually using COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 26. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (20237) PubMed Google Scholar ). REFMAC5 was used for initial model refinement ( Murshudov et al., 2011 59. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (4809) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final refinement was performed with phenix.refine ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (13401) PubMed Google Scholar ) using translation-libration-screw (TLS) parametrization of B-factors. The native structure was solved by molecular replacement. The final models contain two copies of Nos RcaΔC per asymmetric unit. One chain (chain B) has ADP bound. Residues 276–291 were disordered in chain A. In chain B, residues 105–115, 248–254 and 279–291 are missing. Residues facing solvent channels with disordered side-chains were modeled as alanine. The model of the native structure contains 14 ordered water molecules and exhibits reasonable stereochemistry with 96.6% of the residues in the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot according to the criteria of MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 18. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (7959) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Nos SSUL – The native diffraction data of the crystals of Nos SSUL were collected at the automated beamline ID30A-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. MAD data for a presumed Pt-derivative were collected at beamline BM30A at ESRF. The diffraction data from Nos SSUL crystals were integrated with XDS and further processed with POINTLESS ( Evans, 2006 30. Evans, P. Scaling and assessment of data quality Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :72-82 Crossref Scopus (3316) PubMed Google Scholar ), AIMLESS ( Evans and Murshudov, 2013 31. Evans, P.R. ∙ Murshudov, G.N. How good are my data and what is the resolution? Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2013; 69 :1204-1214 Crossref Scopus (1873) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CTRUNCATE ( French and Wilson, 1978 33. French, G. ∙ Wilson, K. On the treatment of negative intensity observations Acta Crystallogr. A. 1978; 34 :517-525 Crossref Google Scholar ) as implemented in the CCP4i graphical user interface ( Potterton et al., 2003 70. Potterton, E. ∙ Briggs, P. ∙ Turkenburg, M. ... A graphical user interface to the CCP4 program suite Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59 :1131-1137 Crossref Scopus (965) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of Nos SSUL was solved by MAD using the Auto-Rickshaw platform ( Panjikar et al., 2005 63.

Crystallogr. 2005; 61 :449-457 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). The anomalous scatterers were a bound Ni 2+ atom from protein purification and presumably ordered Cl - ions. The chemical environment of the sites was not compatible with PtCl 4 2- . The asymmetric unit contained two copies of the SSUL domain. The model was edited manually using Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 26. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (20237) PubMed Google Scholar ). REFMAC5 was used for model refinement ( Murshudov et al., 2011 59. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (4809) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model contains 203 ordered water molecules and exhibits reasonable stereochemistry with 99.5% of the residues in the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot according to the criteria of MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 18. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (7959) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The quality of the structural models was analyzed with the program Molprobity ( Chen et al., 2010 18. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (7959) PubMed Google Scholar ). Coordinates were aligned with Lsqkab and Lsqman ( Kleywegt and Jones, 1994 45. Kleywegt, G.T. ∙ Jones, T.A. A super position CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newslett. Protein Crystallog. 1994; 31 :9-14 Google Scholar ). Molecular interfaces were analyzed with PISA ( Krissinel and Henrick, 2007 46. Krissinel, E. ∙ Henrick, K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state J. Mol.

The oligomeric state of proteins in solution was analyzed using the program Astra version 4.90.08 (Wyatt Technology). Data in Figures 1 B–1D, 3 E, 5 F, and S6 E represent the standard deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments (n = 3). Data in Figures 6 C, 6D, and 6G are representative curves of three independent experiments.
