Title: Discovery of a Regulatory Subunit of the Yeast Fatty Acid Synthase


Abstract: Summary

Fatty acid synthases (FASs) are central to metabolism but are also of biotechnological interest for the production of fine chemicals and biofuels from renewable resources. During fatty acid synthesis, the growing fatty acid chain is thought to be shuttled by the dynamic acyl carrier protein domain to several enzyme active sites. Here, we report the discovery of a γ subunit of the 2.6 megadalton α 6 -β 6 S. cerevisiae FAS, which is shown by high-resolution structures to stabilize a rotated FAS conformation and rearrange ACP domains from equatorial to axial positions. The γ subunit spans the length of the FAS inner cavity, impeding reductase activities of FAS, regulating NADPH turnover by kinetic hysteresis at the ketoreductase, and suppressing off-pathway reactions at the enoylreductase. The γ subunit delineates the functional compartment within FAS. As a scaffold, it may be exploited to incorporate natural and designed enzymatic activities that are not present in natural FAS.

Section: Introduction

Fatty acids and their biosynthesis are essential for the survival of all organisms, representing building blocks of biological membranes, but also energy reserves of a cell and precursors to second messenger molecules ( Graber et al., 1994 18. Graber, R. ∙ Sumida, C. ∙ Nunez, E.A. Fatty acids and cell signal transduction J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9 :91-116 PubMed Google Scholar ). In bacteria, yeasts, and plants, the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids is essential for survival ( Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004; White et al., 2005 48. Schweizer, E. ∙ Hofmann, J.

Biochem. 2005; 74 :791-831 Crossref Scopus (667) PubMed Google Scholar ), while metazoans rely on additional dietary uptake ( Burr and Brown, 1933 3. Burr, G.O. ∙ Brown, W.R. On the Fatty Acids Essential in Nutrition Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1933; 30 :1349-1352 Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar ). Subtle changes in fatty acid synthesis impact numerous vital cellular functions and are thus linked to ailments like cancer and obesity ( López et al., 2007; Ronnett et al., 2006; Wang and Dubois, 2012 30.

In light of the central metabolic role of fatty acid synthesis, a common biosynthetic route is employed by all organisms ( Figure 1 A), necessitating four central metabolites—acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, NAD(P)H, and ATP. Despite conservation of the biosynthetic reaction mechanisms, the architecture of fatty acid synthase (FAS) differs across the kingdoms of life. Plants, bacteria, and mitochondria harbor the required activities on individual polypeptides (type II FAS) ( White et al., 2005 56. White, S.W. ∙ Zheng, J. ∙ Zhang, Y.-M. ... The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74 :791-831 Crossref Scopus (667) PubMed Google Scholar ). Type I FAS systems, where the synthetic activities are combined within a single macromolecular complex, are found in yeasts, Corynebacteria/Mycobacteria/Nocardia (CMN) group bacteria, as well as in higher eukaryotes ( Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004 48. Schweizer, E. ∙ Hofmann, J. Microbial type I fatty acid synthases (FAS): major players in a network of cellular FAS systems Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68 :501-517 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). In higher eukaryotes, FAS is formed by a cross-shaped homodimer ( Maier et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2003 33.

Structural studies by multiple labs have established that the type I fungal FAS is a D3 symmetric 2.6 MDa multi-enzyme complex that forms a barrel-shaped particle with a length of 270 Å and a width of 250 Å ( Gipson et al., 2010; Jenni et al., 2007; Leibundgut et al., 2007; Lomakin et al., 2007; Stoops and Wakil, 1978; Wieland et al., 1978 16.

USA. 1978; 75 :5792-5796 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies indicate that the S. cerevisiae FAS is composed of six α subunit copies, which form an equatorial central wheel, and six β subunit copies, which form the two domes of the particle ( Figure 1 B). All enzymatic activities required for the synthesis of saturated C 16 -C 18 fatty acid chains reside within α- and β-subunits ( Figure 1 C) ( Lynen, 1980; Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004 32. Lynen, F.

Microbial type I fatty acid synthases (FAS): major players in a network of cellular FAS systems Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68 :501-517 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). The α-subunit contains ketoreductase (KR), ketosynthase (KS), and phosphopantetheine transferase (PPT) domains, while the β subunit harbors acetyltransferase (AT), enoylreductase (ER), and dehydratase (DH) domains. The malonyl/palmitoyl transferase (MPT) domain is mostly formed by the C-terminal part of the β subunit and completed by the N terminus of the α subunit ( Jenni et al., 2007; Leibundgut et al., 2007 23.

The acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain is tethered flexibly onto the α subunit ( Gipson et al., 2010; Leibundgut et al., 2007; Lomakin et al., 2007 16. Gipson, P. ∙ Mills, D.J. ∙ Wouts, R. ...

ACP-bound intermediates are thought to be iteratively shuttled to all active sites in a stochastic manner ( Anselmi et al., 2010; Leibundgut et al., 2007 1.

In addition to academic interest in fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acids have emerged as platform compounds for the biotechnological production of fine chemicals and biofuels ( Biermann et al., 2011; Marella et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014 2.

Biotechnol. 2014; 2 :32 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, fungal FAS has been engineered to generate e.g., short chain fatty acids and related polyketides ( Gajewski et al., 2017b, 2017a 12. Gajewski, J. ∙ Pavlovic, R. ∙ Fischer, M. ...

Despite academic and biotechnological interest in FAS, several mechanistic and regulatory aspects have remained elusive. The metabolic load exerted upon a cell for the biosynthesis of a single palmitic acid amounts to the energetic equivalent of 122 ATP molecules ( Nelson and Cox, 2012 37. Nelson, D.L. ∙ Cox, M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry W. H. Freeman and Company, 2012 Google Scholar ). The energy consumption and central metabolic importance of FAS requires a tight control of its activity, which is ascribed to transcriptional control ( Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004 48. Schweizer, E. ∙ Hofmann, J. Microbial type I fatty acid synthases (FAS): major players in a network of cellular FAS systems Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68 :501-517 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ), through multiple layers of ACC regulation ( Wakil et al., 1983 54. Wakil, S.J. ∙ Stoops, J.K. ∙ Joshi, V.C. Fatty acid synthesis and its regulation Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52 :537-579 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and feedback inhibition by palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoA ( Lust and Lynen, 1968 31. Lust, G. ∙ Lynen, F. The inhibition of the fatty acid synthetase multienzyme complex of yeast by long-chain acyl coenzyme A compounds Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 7 :68-72 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). No protein that directly regulates FAS activity has been described to date. Equally, it is not known if stochastic ACP movement is coincident with conformational changes of fungal FAS domes, or if accessory factors are required, because FAS structures with ACPs in defined functional intermediate states remain elusive. Additionally, a functional unit within FAS is defined by spatial proximity of catalytic domains residing on α- and β-subunits in accordance with fungal FAS architecture ( Anselmi et al., 2010; Leibundgut et al., 2007 1. Anselmi, C. ∙ Grininger, M. ∙ Gipson, P. ... Mechanism of substrate shuttling by the acyl-carrier protein within the fatty acid mega-synthase J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 :12357-12364 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Leibundgut, M. ∙ Jenni, S. ∙ Frick, C. ... Structural basis for substrate delivery by acyl carrier protein in the yeast fatty acid synthase Science. 2007; 316 :288-290 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), but other possibilities cannot be excluded.
Here, we describe the discovery of a regulatory subunit of yeast FAS, which we propose to term the FAS γ subunit. A maximum of six γ subunit copies bind to a single α 6 β 6 FAS molecule occupying all six reaction chambers, with each γ subunit simultaneously contacting a single α subunit and two adjacent β subunits. γ subunit binding stabilizes a rotated FAS conformation, which is accompanied by ACP domains rearranging from KS domain positions to AT domain positions. The γ subunit regulates FAS enzymatic activity in response to the abundance of its co-substrate NADPH, induces hysteretic behavior of FAS turnover, and suppresses futile ER catalytic cycles. The γ subunit thus directly interacts with FAS, regulates its activity, and influences its structure, including the ACP shuttle system.

Section: Results

To mechanistically interrogate structural determinants governing iterative shuttling, we set out to establish a purification procedure that would yield highly active, biochemically, and structurally homogeneous FAS from the yeast S. cerevisiae . We adapted a chromatography-free purification procedure to the FAS that had previously yielded preparations of higher specific activity for 20S and 26S proteasomes ( Haselbach et al., 2017; Schrader et al., 2016 20. Haselbach, D. ∙ Schrader, J. ∙ Lambrecht, F. ... Long-range allosteric regulation of the human 26S proteasome by 20S proteasome-targeting cancer drugs Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15578 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 46. Schrader, J. ∙ Henneberg, F. ∙ Mata, R.A. ... The inhibition mechanism of human 20S proteasomes enables next-generation inhibitor design Science. 2016; 353 :594-598 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). This approach relies on fractionated PEG precipitation and density gradient centrifugation as orthogonal purification steps ( Figure 1 D) and allows for gentle, yet stringent, purification at constant (low-) ionic strength ( Figures 1 D–1F). During the entire purification process, FAS concentrations never drop below 0.4 μM and we discovered a 20 kDa protein that reproducibly co-purifies with FAS ( Figure 1 E). Tandem-MS of tryptic digests identified this protein as Tma17p ( Table S1 ). We cross-validated that Tma17p represents the co-purified 20 kDa protein by generating a Δtma17 knockout yeast strain and purifying FAS. As shown in Figure 1 F, when purified from the Δtma17 strain, the 20 kDa band is absent from purified FAS fractions, corroborating the tandem-MS results. Thus, Tma17p co-purifies with the FAS and appears to represent a putative hitherto unknown subunit of yeast FAS.
An additional protein subunit of yeast FAS has not been described in close to five decades of biochemical investigation. Tma17p has previously been described to be associated with the translational machinery or involved in proteasome assembly ( Fleischer et al., 2006; Hanssum et al., 2014 11. Fleischer, T.C. ∙ Weaver, C.M. ∙ McAfee, K.J. ... Systematic identification and functional screens of uncharacterized proteins associated with eukaryotic ribosomal complexes Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :1294-1307 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar 19.

However, SDS-PAGE and tandem-mass spectrometry (MS) analyses indicate that neither the ribosome nor the proteasome are present in stoichiometric amounts in our FAS preparations, whereas Tma17p definitively is ( Figure 1 E). Tma17p is widely conserved in yeasts ( Figure S1 A; Data S1 ) and has been described to be upregulated under conditions of cellular stress and function in the context of proteasome assembly ( Hanssum et al., 2014; Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2016 19. Hanssum, A. ∙ Zhong, Z. ∙ Rousseau, A. ... An inducible chaperone adapts proteasome assembly to stress Mol. Cell. 2014; 55 :566-577 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Rousseau, A. ∙ Bertolotti, A. An evolutionarily conserved pathway controls proteasome homeostasis Nature. 2016; 536 :184-189 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we were unable to reproduce formerly described viability defects of Δtma17 yeast strains in response to stressors in several genetic backgrounds ( Figure S1 B). On the other hand, co-purification and co-sedimentation of Tma17p with FAS in the 40S region of gradients suggests a direct biochemical interaction, and Tma17p abundance in purified FAS fractions indicates that earlier copy number estimates are incorrect ( https://www.yeastgenome.org ) ( Cherry et al., 2012 5.

Saccharomyces Genome Database: the genomics resource of budding yeast Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :D700-D705 Crossref Scopus (1295) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Based on our results and widely contrasting earlier findings ( Fleischer et al., 2006; Hanssum et al., 2014; Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2016 11. Fleischer, T.C. ∙ Weaver, C.M. ∙ McAfee, K.J. ... Systematic identification and functional screens of uncharacterized proteins associated with eukaryotic ribosomal complexes Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :1294-1307 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar 19.

Rousseau, A. ∙ Bertolotti, A. An evolutionarily conserved pathway controls proteasome homeostasis Nature. 2016; 536 :184-189 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ), we chose to perform a series of control experiments to establish that Tma17p indeed is a bona fide subunit of yeast FAS. First, we investigated the stability of the Tma17p-FAS interaction in dependence of ionic strength. Purified FAS was loaded onto density gradients containing either 50 mM KCl, 150 mM KCl, or 250 mM KCl ( Figure 2 A). Co-purified, endogenous Tma17p quantitatively dissociates from FAS at 250 mM KCl, which results in the sedimentation of Tma17p in top fractions of density gradients, akin to recombinant Tma17p (rTma17p) ( Figure S1 C). At 150 mM KCl, roughly half of co-purified Tma17p dissociates, whereas at 50 mM KCl, the co-purified Tma17p remains firmly associated to FAS and co-sediments in the 40S region. Second, we asked if ΔTma17p-FAS could be reconstituted with rTma17p and if the stability of the reconstituted complex resembled that of the endogenous complex. While the reconstituted complex is stable at 50 mM KCl, rTma17p dissociates quantitatively at 150 mM KCl ( Figure 2 B). We attribute this difference to the lack of post-translational modification upon expression in E. coli ( Table S1 ). Third, we set out to quantify the thermodynamics of Tma17p-binding to FAS. ΔTma17p-FAS was incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant, fluorescently labeled Tma17p, and complex formation was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis, followed by quantification of the FAS-bound Tma17p fluorescence. Binding of Tma17p to FAS results in the shift of its mobility to a position, where it co-migrates with FAS. When the experiment is performed at 1 μM FAS, full saturation occurs at a 6-fold molar excess of fluorescent Tma17p, indicating that 6 copies of Tma17p can simultaneously bind to one FAS molecule. When the binding data were fit with a sigmoidal binding model using the Hill equation, this experiment revealed a positive cooperativity of Tma17p binding to FAS (Hill coefficient of n H = 1.6 ± 0.1) and a dissociation constant of K 0.5 = 3.1 ± 0.1 μM ( Figure 2 C). When the data were alternatively fit with a quadratic equation, a K D = 0.35 ± 0.07 μM was obtained ( Figure S1 D). Fourth, fluorescently labeled trypsin inhibitor, which is both similar in size and charge, was unable to bind FAS under the same conditions ( Figure S1 E), negating unspecific binding of Tma17p to FAS. We asked if the entire Tma17p polypeptide segment is essential for its association with FAS. Guided by secondary structure predictions ( Figure S1 F), we either singly removed the N-terminal segment (1–24) or the C-terminal segment (117–150). Both deletions were individually sufficient to abolish binding of Tma17p to FAS ( Figure 2 D).
Taken together, these experiments indicate that Tma17p is a weakly associated, salt-labile, integral subunit of the yeast FAS. It appears to have escaped identification as a FAS subunit due to the relatively high salt conditions previously employed to purify FAS and spontaneous dissociation of Tma17p based on its weak affinity ( Leibundgut et al., 2007; Lomakin et al., 2007 28. Leibundgut, M. ∙ Jenni, S. ∙ Frick, C. ... Structural basis for substrate delivery by acyl carrier protein in the yeast fatty acid synthase Science. 2007; 316 :288-290 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Lomakin, I.B. ∙ Xiong, Y. ∙ Steitz, T.A. The crystal structure of yeast fatty acid synthase, a cellular machine with eight active sites working together Cell. 2007; 129 :319-332 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). The observed cooperativity of binding and the synergistic requirement of both N as well as C termini exclude non-specific association of Tma17p with FAS. Henceforth, we will refer to Tma17p as the FAS γ subunit, to FAS devoid of the γ subunit as Δγ-FAS.
To gather insights into the function of the γ subunit, we analyzed FAS steady-state kinetics both in its presence and absence and measured the rates of FAS substrate turnover with respect to varying concentrations of the substrates acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH. This analysis revealed substrate-excess inhibition for both acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, and a moderate modulation of the maximum rate (V max ), substrate affinity (K 0.5 app ), cooperativity of substrate binding (Hill coefficient n H ), and substrate inhibition (K i ) by the γ subunit ( Figures 3 A and 3B). In contrast, the analysis of steady-state kinetics at different NADPH concentrations revealed a direct impact of the γ subunit on NADPH binding and processing by FAS ( Figures 3 C–3F). With Δγ-FAS, steady-state conditions are established at once such that the measured initial and steady-state rates are equal. In contrast, FAS substrate turnover progress curves exhibit a pronounced hysteretic behavior in the presence of the γ subunit. FAS displays a smaller activity ( v 0 > 0) and undergoes a mono-exponential activation phase to establish steady state with a multi-fold enhanced activity ( v ss > v 0 ) before substrate depletion sets in ( Figures 3 C, 3D, and S2 ). The apparent Michaelis constant (K 0.5 app ) for NADPH is lower in the case of Δγ-FAS and increased 3-fold in the presence of the γ subunit both for initial and steady-state rates ( Figure 3 E). This effect elicited by the γ subunit is more pronounced at low NADPH concentrations and almost absent at higher concentrations, where the initial rate nearly equals the steady-state rate ( Figures 3 C, 3D, and S2 ). Steady-state conditions are established after ∼20 s, implying that a slow, large-scale conformational change coincides with activation. Even the addition of high molar excesses of trypsin inhibitor as a control ( Figure 3 F) exerted no such effect, highlighting γ subunit specificity. At high NADPH concentrations (≥100 μM), the γ subunit enhances the activity of FAS in comparison to Δγ-FAS by ∼25%, whereas at lower NADPH concentrations, it slows the turnover rate of FAS almost 2-fold.
We also observed NADPH to be consumed by FAS in the ER domain even in the absence of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA ( Figure 3 G), where a possible deleterious side reaction can occur: the NADPH-dependent oxidation of oxygen by the FMN cofactor to form reactive oxygen species including H 2 O 2 ( Chaiyen et al., 2012 4. Chaiyen, P. ∙ Fraaije, M.W. ∙ Mattevi, A. The enigmatic reaction of flavins with oxygen Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37 :373-380 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recognized that the γ subunit retards NADPH turnover in the absence of the substrates acetyl- and malonyl-CoA ( Figure 3 G). Therefore, the γ subunit additionally enhances the productivity of FAS by suppressing ER domain futile cycles.
Together, the kinetic data show that the γ subunit impacts FAS enzymatic activity, in particular the reductase activities, such that the NADPH-dependence dynamic range is broadened to accommodate differences in cellular metabolism. The estimated K 0.5 app of Δγ-FAS for NADPH (17.7 μM) is significantly lower than reported cellular concentrations of NADPH (50–150 μM) ( Gancedo and Gancedo, 1973; Polakis and Bartley, 1966 14. Gancedo, J.M. ∙ Gancedo, C. Concentrations of intermediary metabolites in yeast Biochimie. 1973; 55 :205-211 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Polakis, E.S. ∙ Bartley, W. Changes in the intracellular concentrations of adenosine phosphates and nicotinamide nucleotides during the aerobic growth cycle of yeast on different carbon sources Biochem. J. 1966; 99 :521-533 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), implying that FAS activity, if left unregulated, would rapidly deplete NADPH, jeopardizing cellular survival. The γ subunit allows cells to regulate FAS activity over an enhanced concentration regime of NADPH, well within the physiological range.
Having established that Tma17p constitutes an authentic, regulatory γ subunit of FAS, we asked whether its binding impacts the overall structure of FAS. We set out to solve the structure of FAS co-purified with the γ subunit by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We recognized that two predominant FAS conformations are imaged, either with a non-rotated or with a rotated dome structure ( Figure 4 A). Both conformations are related to each other by an ∼15° twist with respect to the central 3-fold symmetry axis at the top of the dome. This results in an inward shift of the AT domain and an outward shift of the MPT domain. 40% single particles adopted the non-rotated conformation, while 60% single particles resided in the rotated one ( Figure 4 B). Could the existence of one or both of these conformations correlate with the γ subunit? Considering the relatively weak affinity of the γ subunit to FAS, and the fact that cryo-EM grids were prepared at a concentration of 0.2 μM FAS, we surmised that partial γ subunit dissociation might have occurred, eliciting conformational heterogeneity. By reconstituting Δγ-FAS with increasing amounts of the γ subunit and counting particles in either the non-rotated or rotated conformation on cryo-EM grids ( Figure 4 C), we found that the abundance of particles in the rotated state correlates with the amount of γ subunit added.
With this information, we proceeded to determine high-resolution structures of FAS in both conformations. For the non-rotated conformation, we initially grew crystals of Δγ-FAS, which belong to the primitive monoclinic space group P2 1 with unit cell constants of a = 217.6 Å, b = 347.6 Å, c = 265.3 Å, and β = 107.9° and contain a single Δγ-FAS in the asymmetric unit and diffracted X-rays to 2.9 Å ( Table S2 ). The structure revealed excellent electron density throughout the molecule ( Figures 4 D and S3 A; Table S2 ). Analysis of the diffraction data with the STARANISO server indicated mild anisotropy of 0.1–0.2 Å along the various unit cell directions. Anisotropic truncation of the data improved refinement of the model, resulting in lower average B-factors and R work /R free of 19.2%/21.1% ( Figures S3 B–S3D; Table S2 ). This crystal structure in the non-rotated conformation, where all functional domains of FAS are clearly resolved, is the basis for all models of FAS described in this article. This is exemplified by the ability to clearly resolve the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group attached to Ser180 of the ACP domain, as well as the entire PPT domain ( Figure 4 D). We were also able to obtain a Δγ-FAS structure in the non-rotated conformation by cryo-EM at global resolutions, estimated using the 0.143 Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion of 2.9 Å with applied D3 symmetry, 3.0 Å with applied C3 symmetry, and 3.3 Å in asymmetric reconstructions ( Figure S4 ; Table S2 ). This cryo-EM dataset contained 92% single particles in the non-rotated state and 8% in the rotated conformation, suggesting that there is a dynamic equilibrium between non-rotated and rotated conformations and the latter is stabilized by the γ subunit.
We then proceeded to determine the structure of the reconstituted FAS/γ subunit complex. This dataset was essentially devoid of particles in the non-rotated conformation, corroborating that the γ subunit stabilizes the rotated FAS conformation. We were able to reconstruct a cryo-EM structure in the rotated conformation at a global resolution, estimated using the 0.143 FSC criterion of 2.8 Å with applied D3 symmetry, 2.9 Å with applied C3 symmetry, and 3.2 Å in asymmetric reconstructions ( Figure S5 ; Table S2 ). The quality of the cryo-EM map allowed the reliable modeling of the rotated FAS conformation ( Figure 4 E). To ensure that the rotated conformation was not spuriously stabilized by the dissociation of the γ subunit at the protein concentrations employed for cryo-EM grid preparation, we also grew crystals of the reconstituted FAS/γ subunit complex at higher protein concentrations. We obtained crystals of the FAS/γ subunit complex, which belong to the primitive monoclinic space group P2 1 with unit cell constants of a = 234.9Å, b = 430.3Å, c = 422.6Å, and β = 97°, that contain two FAS molecules in the asymmetric unit and diffracted X-rays to 4.6 Å resolution ( Table S2 ). The FAS/γ subunit crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement using the Δγ-FAS crystal structure described above, which allowed for the reliable modeling of a Cα-trace and confirmed that the rotated conformation is indeed attained in the presence of the γ subunit ( Figure S6 ). The similarity among models derived from cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography for both dome conformations enables a conclusive interpretation of the structural impact of γ subunit binding ( Table S2 ). Notably, these findings are not flawed by different crystal contacts or imposed symmetry in calculation of the cryo-EM structures and allow for cross-validation of the structural data. In summary, the high-resolution structures of FAS in non-rotated and rotated conformations suggest that the two states are linked in a spontaneous thermodynamically controlled manner, and binding of the γ subunit to the FAS stabilizes the rotated conformation.
The large-scale rearrangements to attain the rotated conformation of the FAS dome ( Figure 4 A) appear to be predominantly driven by rigid-body motions rather than conformational changes within the enzymatic domains ( Table S2 ). Structures of both conformations at high-resolution allow us to address the questions: (1) do conformational changes in the FAS dome impact the ACP domain, and (2) does the γ subunit architecture when bound to FAS, explain how it modulates FAS activity.
In the non-rotated Δγ-FAS structure, all ACP domains are found in close proximity to the KS site ( Figure 5 A, left panel), as previously reported ( Johansson et al., 2008; Leibundgut et al., 2007; Lomakin et al., 2007 24. Johansson, P. ∙ Wiltschi, B. ∙ Kumari, P. ... Inhibition of the fungal fatty acid synthase type I multienzyme complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :12803-12808 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Leibundgut, M. ∙ Jenni, S. ∙ Frick, C. ... Structural basis for substrate delivery by acyl carrier protein in the yeast fatty acid synthase Science. 2007; 316 :288-290 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Lomakin, I.B. ∙ Xiong, Y. ∙ Steitz, T.A. The crystal structure of yeast fatty acid synthase, a cellular machine with eight active sites working together Cell. 2007; 129 :319-332 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, all ACP domains are found in proximity to the AT domain in the rotated, γ subunit bound FAS structure ( Figures 5 A and S6 ). This ACP domain position is unambiguously evidenced by positive difference density- and omit-maps of the rotated FAS crystal structure ( Figure S6 ), as well as in the cryo-EM density ( Figure 5 A). Thus, the γ subunit stabilized rotated dome structure appears to coincide with ACP domain relocation to AT domains. This rotated to non-rotated conformational transition of the dome most likely is the basis for the hysteretic behavior of FAS ( Figures 3 C–3F and S2 ). Is the rotated conformation a consequence of the γ subunit directly stabilizing this ACP domain position? Favoring this hypothesis, we found 12 additional cryo-EM density elements within rotated FAS domes ( Figure 5 B) that were cross-validated in difference density- and omit-maps of the rotated FAS crystal structure ( Figure S6 ), and cannot be explained by FAS α- or β-subunits. The densities displayed sufficient detail that allowed for modeling the γ subunit sequence in a visible coiled-coil segment ( Figures 5 C and S6 ). The density element juxtaposed to the ER domain could be modeled by the N-terminal portion of the γ subunit, whereas its C-terminal 18 residues could be modeled into density contacting the KR active site ( Figure 5 C). This structural model of the γ subunit was independently validated by crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) ( Figures 5 D and S7 ) using three cross-linkers: BS3, SDA, and EDC-NHS (with spacer arms lengths of 11.4 Å, 3.9 Å, and 0 Å, respectively). In addition, XL-MS revealed a spatial proximity of the central part of the γ subunit (residues 60–75) to the MPT domain and an association of residues 110–130 of the γ subunit with the KR domain. These segments of the γ subunit are flexible and poorly resolved in the cryo-EM density. Moreover, the cryo-EM γ subunit model fits the difference density of the rotated FAS crystal structure and strongly resembles ab initio models generated by Robetta ( Kim et al., 2004 26. Kim, D.E. ∙ Chivian, D. ∙ Baker, D. Protein structure prediction and analysis using the Robetta server Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 W526-31 Crossref Scopus (1548) Google Scholar ) (data not shown).
Closer inspection of the FAS-bound γ subunit architecture revealed that the N-terminal part occludes the ER active site, whereas the C-terminal 18 residues of the γ subunit occupy the KR domain active site ( Figure 5 E). This (1) rationalizes why NADPH binding and processing is modulated by the γ subunit ( Figures 3 E and 3F), (2) provides a structural basis for the observed hysteretic behavior ( Figures 3 C–3F and S2 ), and (3) addresses how the formation of off-pathway reactive oxygen species is suppressed at the ER domain ( Figure 3 G). ACP binding to the AT domain upon dome rotation is not restrained in the rotated conformation, where it is additionally stabilized by γ subunit interactions with the ER and MPT domains and additional electrostatic γ subunit/ACP interaction ( Figure S6 ). Whereas in the non-rotated state, two helices of the ER domain—encompassing β-subunit residues 687–698 and 709–723, respectively—constrict the space required for the ACP to bind the AT domain ( Figure 5 F). Rearrangement of these helices, both in the presence and absence of the γ subunit, facilitates ACP binding to the AT domain. Together, the γ subunit spans a distance of ∼120 Å inside the cavity of the FAS dome, structurally modulates access of NADPH to the processing reductase domains, and drives a wedge (the coiled-coil segment) into the AT-ER interface to stabilize the rotated conformation and ACP domain binding to AT domains.
The structural findings described in Figures 4 and 5 indicate that γ subunit binding impacts the FAS conformational landscape. Non-rotated and rotated states appear to co-exist in a thermodynamic, interchanging equilibrium with the γ subunit stabilizing the rotated conformation, which is the basis of the observed kinetic hysteresis ( Figure 3 ). To further characterize and interrogate the thermodynamics of these functionally important γ subunit-induced conformational changes, we applied our method of 3D classification combined with energy landscape calculation ( Haselbach et al., 2017, 2018 20. Haselbach, D. ∙ Schrader, J. ∙ Lambrecht, F. ... Long-range allosteric regulation of the human 26S proteasome by 20S proteasome-targeting cancer drugs Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15578 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 21. Haselbach, D. ∙ Komarov, I. ∙ Agafonov, D.E. ... Structure and Conformational Dynamics of the Human Spliceosomal B act Complex Cell. 2018; 172 :454-464 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). We collected individual cryo-EM datasets of Δγ-FAS, reconstituted with increasing concentrations of the γ subunit, and refined 3D structures of each individual dataset with a mask corresponding to the central wheel. To assess the conformational space occupied by the dome in each individual dataset, we then performed a 3D-classification without alignment in batches of 6,500 particles each, relying exclusively on the previously obtained alignment parameters of the central wheel. The individual 3D classes were refined to ensure their validity and subsequently subjected to 3D principal component analysis (PCA). The first eigenvector of this 3D PCA describes the compaction of the dome, whereas the second eigenvector signifies the notable rotation of the dome ( Video S1 ). The number of particles in each 3D class was then used to map an energy landscape by performing a Boltzmann interpolation in a coordinate system that is defined by the first and second eigenvectors of the PCA. The energy landscapes, shown in Figure 6 , for each individual dataset recapitulate the observation that binding of the γ subunit and ensuing formation of the FAS/γ subunit complex results in the adoption of the rotated conformation. Moreover, the energy landscapes indicate that γ subunit binding generates an energy barrier at 4°C (where the experiments were performed), restricting kinetic access to the non-rotated conformation. The energy difference between the two FAS conformations was found to be in the range of ∼2 k B T, which suggests that thermal energy is sufficient to drive conformational changes in FAS. The stabilization of the rotated conformation by the energy barrier formed by the γ subunit most likely serves to open a kinetic window for the regulation of the enzymatic activity of FAS.

Section: Discussion

In this article, we report the discovery of a weakly associated, regulatory γ subunit of the yeast FAS, which has escaped detection in over 50 years of research on this essential multi-enzyme complex. We have applied a series of biochemical and enzymological approaches and further determined high-resolution structures, by both X-ray crystallography and single particle cryo-EM, to elucidate the function of the regulatory γ subunit within the context of FAS. The γ subunit, a 17-kDa protein, co-sediments with FAS in the 40S region and reproducibly co-purifies. Further, six molecules of the γ subunit can bind per FAS molecule in a cooperative manner with an affinity in the low μM range. At this time, however, whether in vivo FAS is always saturated by six molecules of the γ subunit, or FAS species exist, where sub-saturating amounts of γ subunit are bound, remains to be seen.
Functionally, the γ subunit modulates NADPH binding and processing indicated by kinetic hysteresis ( Figures 3 C–3F). At low NADPH concentrations, the initial rate of substrate turnover by FAS is reduced by the γ subunit by a factor of two. A slow exponential activation phase follows to establish true steady-state turnover conditions, which most likely depend on large-scale conformational rearrangements. At high NADPH concentrations, the γ subunit increases substrate turnover by 25% ( Figures 3 D–F), simultaneously, it suppresses futile cycling of NADPH at the ER domain caused by the NADPH-dependent formation of off-pathway reactive oxygen species ( Figure 3 G). This is achieved by the γ subunit N-terminal 24 residues occluding and kinetically retarding NADPH binding and reduction by the FMN cofactor at the ER domain active site ( Figure 5 E, panel i). Considering the K 0.5 app of Δγ-FAS, which lies well below reported cellular concentration ranges of NADPH ( Gancedo and Gancedo, 1973; Polakis and Bartley, 1966 14. Gancedo, J.M. ∙ Gancedo, C. Concentrations of intermediary metabolites in yeast Biochimie. 1973; 55 :205-211 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Polakis, E.S. ∙ Bartley, W. Changes in the intracellular concentrations of adenosine phosphates and nicotinamide nucleotides during the aerobic growth cycle of yeast on different carbon sources Biochem. J. 1966; 99 :521-533 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), the control exerted by the γ subunit serves to keep a potential over-consumption of NADPH by FAS in check ( Figure 7 B). While the γ subunit-induced modulation of NADPH binding and processing by kinetic hysteresis is most apparent ( Figures 3 C–3F and S2 ), we note that the γ subunit also exerts changes in the K 0.5 app of both acetyl- and malonyl-CoA ( Figure 3 A and 3B), which may also minimize the risk of FAS depleting cellular pools of these two co-substrates ( Shpilka et al., 2015 49. Shpilka, T. ∙ Welter, E. ∙ Borovsky, N. ... Fatty acid synthase is preferentially degraded by autophagy upon nitrogen starvation in yeast Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :1434-1439 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Structurally, Δγ-FAS was found to mainly adopt a non-rotated conformation, where the ACP domain is located at the KS domain ( Figure 7 A). However, in the presence of the γ subunit, the FAS predominantly adopts the rotated conformation, where the FAS β-subunits swivel around the 3-fold symmetry axis, and the ACP domains are localized to the AT domain. The γ subunit thus directly regulates FAS activity by forming a complex and modulating its conformational landscape.
In this study, we adapted a non-chromatographic strategy to the yeast FAS, which allows for the high-yield purification of large macromolecular assemblies at a constant ionic strength and pH ( Haselbach et al., 2017; Schrader et al., 2016 20. Haselbach, D. ∙ Schrader, J. ∙ Lambrecht, F. ... Long-range allosteric regulation of the human 26S proteasome by 20S proteasome-targeting cancer drugs Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15578 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 46. Schrader, J. ∙ Henneberg, F. ∙ Mata, R.A. ... The inhibition mechanism of human 20S proteasomes enables next-generation inhibitor design Science. 2016; 353 :594-598 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). FAS purified by this method was quantitatively saturated by the γ subunit ( Figure 1 E). This protein has been shown to be associated with the translational machinery ( Fleischer et al., 2006 11. Fleischer, T.C. ∙ Weaver, C.M. ∙ McAfee, K.J. ... Systematic identification and functional screens of uncharacterized proteins associated with eukaryotic ribosomal complexes Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :1294-1307 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ), to act as an assembly chaperone for the regulatory particle of the proteasome during stress ( Hanssum et al., 2014 19. Hanssum, A. ∙ Zhong, Z. ∙ Rousseau, A. ... An inducible chaperone adapts proteasome assembly to stress Mol. Cell. 2014; 55 :566-577 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), and in our own experiments, to be a regulator of FAS activity. How are these seemingly unrelated functions exerted by the same protein? The association of the γ subunit with the translation machinery seems to be a mischaracterization. In their original paper, Fleischer et al. (2006) 11. Fleischer, T.C. ∙ Weaver, C.M. ∙ McAfee, K.J. ... Systematic identification and functional screens of uncharacterized proteins associated with eukaryotic ribosomal complexes Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :1294-1307 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar clearly show that FAS co-sediments with the γ subunit, and the purification of TAP-tagged γ subunit most strongly enriches FAS α- and β-subunits but is devoid of any translational machinery component. The proposed function as an assembly chaperone for the proteasome regulatory particle ( Hanssum et al., 2014 19. Hanssum, A. ∙ Zhong, Z. ∙ Rousseau, A. ... An inducible chaperone adapts proteasome assembly to stress Mol. Cell. 2014; 55 :566-577 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) is fully contradictory to the sedimentation of this protein in the 40S range and is further questioned by the lack of a direct demonstration of biochemical interaction in yeast cells or extracts. However, we note that stimulation of γ subunit and proteasome assembly machinery expression levels genetically interact ( Costanzo et al., 2010 6. Costanzo, M. ∙ Baryshnikova, A. ∙ Bellay, J. ... The genetic landscape of a cell Science. 2010; 327 :425-431 Crossref Scopus (1703) PubMed Google Scholar ) and are controlled by similar signaling pathways ( Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2016 43. Rousseau, A. ∙ Bertolotti, A. An evolutionarily conserved pathway controls proteasome homeostasis Nature. 2016; 536 :184-189 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In contrast to the incongruent functions attributed to this protein by earlier studies, our results have revealed that the γ subunit is a bona fide regulator of FAS, based on the following evidence: (1) the sedimentation of the γ subunit in the 40S range and reproducible co-purification with FAS from cell extracts ( Figures 1 E and 2 A); (2) the saturation of a single FAS molecule by maximally six γ subunit molecules ( Figure 2 C); (3) the sigmoidal association behavior and positive cooperativity of γ subunit binding to FAS ( Figures 2 C and S1 D); (4) both N and C termini of the γ subunit are indispensable for its association with FAS ( Figure 2 D); (5) during purification, FAS is incubated with malonyl-CoA and NADPH to chase intermediates to products ( STAR Methods ), arguing that the γ subunit does not dissociate under turnover conditions ( Figure 1 E); (6) the modulation of NADPH turnover by the γ subunit ( Figures 3 D–3F) and the suppression of futile cycling of NADPH at the ER domain ( Figure 3 G); (7) trypsin inhibitor, a protein with a similar molecular weight and charge, is neither able to bind ( Figure S1 E) nor modulate FAS activity ( Figure 3 F); (8) six specific spatial sites corresponding to the γ subunit were resolved within the FAS dome ( Figure 5 B); (9) three different crosslinkers used for XL-MS validate the specific interaction of the γ subunit ( Figure 5 D); and (10) the γ subunit influences the conformational energy landscape of the FAS dome ( Figures 4 B, 4C, and 6 ) and the ACP domain position ( Figure 5 A).
The overwhelming experimental evidence gathered in this study rules out the possibility of a non-specific interaction between the α 6 β 6 FAS and the γ subunit. It is likely that the γ subunit has escaped detection due to the relatively high-salt conditions commonly employed to purify FAS; the immobilization on solid supports and spontaneous dissociation if FAS concentrations in the μM range are not maintained throughout purification. We infer that the application of chromatography-free purification as described herein for FAS, previously for proteasomes ( Haselbach et al., 2017; Schrader et al., 2016 20. Haselbach, D. ∙ Schrader, J. ∙ Lambrecht, F. ... Long-range allosteric regulation of the human 26S proteasome by 20S proteasome-targeting cancer drugs Nat.

The inhibition mechanism of human 20S proteasomes enables next-generation inhibitor design Science. 2016; 353 :594-598 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( Prajapati et al., 2019 41.

The structure of yeast FAS was described in the late 2000s by multiple groups ( Gipson et al., 2010; Johansson et al., 2008; Leibundgut et al., 2007; Lomakin et al., 2007 16.

Structural basis for substrate delivery by acyl carrier protein in the yeast fatty acid synthase Science. 2007; 316 :288-290 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Lomakin, I.B. ∙ Xiong, Y. ∙ Steitz, T.A. The crystal structure of yeast fatty acid synthase, a cellular machine with eight active sites working together Cell. 2007; 129 :319-332 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on domain organization and proximity of all fatty acid synthetic domains, three functional compartments within the FAS dome were defined ( Jenni et al., 2007 23. Jenni, S. ∙ Leibundgut, M. ∙ Boehringer, D. ... Structure of fungal fatty acid synthase and implications for iterative substrate shuttling Science. 2007; 316 :254-261 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). ACP domains within each compartment were suggested to shuttle growing fatty acid chains in a stochastic manner between different active sites in a clockwise circular trajectory ( Figure 7 C) ( Jenni et al., 2007 23. Jenni, S. ∙ Leibundgut, M. ∙ Boehringer, D. ... Structure of fungal fatty acid synthase and implications for iterative substrate shuttling Science. 2007; 316 :254-261 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). This view was supported by MD simulations: although each ACP domain can reach all active sites within the FAS dome, they mainly remain within their functional compartment, governed by spatial proximity of active sites along with volume exclusion effects of neighboring ACP domains and their linker segments ( Anselmi et al., 2010 1. Anselmi, C. ∙ Grininger, M. ∙ Gipson, P. ... Mechanism of substrate shuttling by the acyl-carrier protein within the fatty acid mega-synthase J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 :12357-12364 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this ACP shuttling mechanism assumed that the FAS dome remains static, undergoes no structural transitions, and is derived without knowledge about the γ subunit. The findings described herein suggest that existing ACP-domain-mediated substrate shuttling models need to be revisited.
The FAS dome can adopt at least two distinct conformational states. The non-rotated conformation, where the ACP domain is located at the KS active site, would functionally represent either acetyl group transfer to the KS active site or the condensation of the malonyl group with the KS-bound acetyl group. The second, rotated conformation, attained by the movement of AT away from ER domains accommodates the ACP domain at the AT active site and represents the acetyl group transfer step from AT to ACP. An immediate consequence of these two conformations corresponding to different catalytic states is to postulate that every FAS functional state is associated with a distinctive, yet unforeseen, conformation. This hypothesis awaits structural studies of stalled intermediates for validation.
One can infer γ subunit function from its binding mode to FAS, where it spans the inner cavity of the FAS dome, contacts three active sites (ER, MPT, and KR) and shuts down every catalytic step except the initial acetylation. The multiple domains contacted by the γ subunit could represent a functional unit within each FAS dome. If one considers all γ subunit contacts, every fatty acid synthetic active site is present but in a different spatial organization than previously suggested. In the functional compartment delineated by the γ subunit, a counter-clockwise movement of the ACP domain among processing active sites would be predicted ( Figure 7 C). Does this new functional spatial arrangement offer any advantage? In the functional compartment outlined by the γ subunit, most ACP-shuttle paths are similar, the distance between the ER-DH domains, however, is notably shortened by 25 Å. Additionally, the γ subunit occupies a volume corresponding to 33% of the FAS dome, eliciting molecular crowding, which has been reported to drive ACP-shuttling ( Anselmi et al., 2010 1. Anselmi, C. ∙ Grininger, M. ∙ Gipson, P. ... Mechanism of substrate shuttling by the acyl-carrier protein within the fatty acid mega-synthase J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 :12357-12364 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, γ subunit binding should yield a different, yet partially more efficient functional cycle, which agrees well with the observed higher activity ( Figures 3 D–3F).
Aside from the mechanistic implications arising from the discovery of a FAS γ subunit, some clear biotechnological implications arise. First, the natural γ subunit structural scaffold can be exploited to introduce known natural and designed enzymatic modules into domes, such as desaturases, absent in wild-type FAS. The replacement of the flexible γ subunit linker segment between the C terminus of the coiled-coil and the KR-binding part appears predestined for this. Similar strategies have been pursued ( Gajewski et al., 2017b, 2017a; Xu et al., 2016 12. Gajewski, J. ∙ Pavlovic, R. ∙ Fischer, M. ... Engineering fungal de novo fatty acid synthesis for short chain fatty acid production Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14650 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Gajewski, J. ∙ Buelens, F. ∙ Serdjukow, S. ... Engineering fatty acid synthases for directed polyketide production Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 :363-365 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar 59.

USA. 2016; 113 :10848-10853 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the strategy proposed here might be advantageous, because the γ subunit is engineered and might reduce adverse viability effects arising from direct FAS engineering. Second, mutation, segmentation, and affinity maturation may allow the manipulation and exploitation of the γ subunit MPT-, ER-, and KR-binding segments as isolated peptides into generalized fatty acid synthase inhibitors ( Figure S7 ). Such compounds will be beneficial for the treatment of i.e., tuberculosis, obesity, and cancer, where FAS is already a validated target.

All yeast manipulations were performed as per standard protocols ( Gietz, 2014 15. Gietz, R.D. Yeast transformation by the LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG method Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1163 :33-44 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains BJ2168 (MATa prc1-407 prb1-1122 pep4-3 leu2 trp1 ura3-52 gal2) and tma17Δ BJ2168 (MATa prc1-407 prb1-1122 pep4-3 leu2 trp1 ura3-52 gal2 tma17::kanMX) were used in this study. tma17Δ (Δγ) BJ2168 cells were generated with the help of plasmid pTF267, pTF267 (pFA6a-TEV-6xGly-12xHis-KanMX) was a gift from Tim Formosa (Addgene plasmid # 44093; http://addgene.org/44093 ; RRID:Addgene_44093). Cells were grown in YPD medium in an Infors 250 l fermenter and harvested in late log phase at an OD 600 of 9-10. Subsequently, cells were washed with cold ddH 2 O and then resuspended in 2X purification buffer (0.05 M BisTris pH 6.5, 0.05 M potassium acetate, 0.01 M magnesium acetate) containing 20% (w/v) sucrose such that 2 mL of buffer was added per gram of cells. Cells were then flash frozen as beads in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further use.
The γ subunit was cloned as a synthetic gene into a pET151/D-TOPO® plasmid (Geneart, Regensburg) and expressed with an N-terminal His 6 -TEV-tag in BL21 Star (DE3) competent cells. The transformed cells were grown at 37°C with 180 rpm shaking until an OD 600 of 0.5 was reached, the temperature was then decreased to 18°C and expression of the γ subunit was induced 1 h after reduction of the temperature by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. γ subunit was expressed for 16 h at 18°C and 180 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 x g, 15 minutes, 4°C), washed with cold ddH 2 O and stored at −80°C.
The purification strategy was adapted from protocols developed earlier for the purification of human 20S and 26S proteasomes ( Haselbach et al., 2017; Schrader et al., 2016 20. Haselbach, D. ∙ Schrader, J. ∙ Lambrecht, F. ... Long-range allosteric regulation of the human 26S proteasome by 20S proteasome-targeting cancer drugs Nat.

The inhibition mechanism of human 20S proteasomes enables next-generation inhibitor design Science. 2016; 353 :594-598 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). We started with 700 g of frozen cell beads (corresponding to 233 g wet cell weight of yeast), which were ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder using a Retsch ZM200 mill. The ground powder was thawed in a water bath at 37°C, supplemented with purification buffer (0.05 M BisTris pH 6.5, 0.05 M potassium acetate, 0.01 M magnesium acetate) to 0.33x concentration from a 10x stock, followed by the addition of sucrose powder to 20% (w/v), benzamidine chloride to 10 mM and PMSF to 1 mM (from a 100 mM stock solution in propanol). The extract was incubated at 25°C on a magnetic stirrer for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through 3 layers each of cheese cloth and miracloth to obtain a S30 yeast cell extract. To this, Octyl Glucose Neopentyl Glycol (OGNG) (from a 10% (w/v) stock) was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v) and the extract was incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 4°C. The supernatant was again filtered through 3 layers each of cheese cloth and miracloth. The thus clarified S100 extract was subjected to differential precipitation with PolyEthyleneGlycol400 (PEG; number signifies the mean molecular weight of the PEG polymer). PEG400 was added to a concentration of 20% (v/v) to the yeast S100 extract while stirring at 18°C and incubated for 30 minutes. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then precipitated by raising the concentration of PEG400 to 30% (v/v) as described above. The precipitate of this step, which contains FAS, was recovered by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C and resuspended in purification buffer containing 2% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mM DTT and 0.01% (w/v) Lauryl Maltose Neopentyl Glycol (LMNG) in an orbital shaker at 18°C. The resuspended material was loaded on 10%–45% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients in purification buffer containing 10 mM DTT, which were centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 16 h at 4°C. Gradients were harvested in 1 mL fractions. SDS-PAGE was utilized to identify fractions containing FAS. Selected fractions were pooled and precipitated by the addition of 40% (v/v) PEG400. After centrifugation (30,000 x g, 30 minutes), the supernatant was removed and the precipitate was resuspended in purification buffer containing 2% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mM DTT and 0.01% (w/v) LMNG. The resuspended material was loaded on linear 10%–45% (w/v) sucrose gradients in purification buffer containing 10 mM DTT, and centrifuged at 79,000 x g for 16 h at 4°C. Fractions containing FAS were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled and cycled in the presence of 50 μM Malonyl CoA and 100 μM of NADPH for 30 min at 18°C. The protein was precipitated and concentrated by the addition of 40% (v/v) PEG400 and resuspended in purification buffer containing 2% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mM DTT and 0.01% (w/v) LMNG. Another round of linear 10%–45% (w/v) sucrose gradients in purification buffer containing 10 mM DTT, centrifuged at 60,000 x g for 16 h at 4°C and subsequent re-precipitation of FAS fractions with 40% (v/v) PEG400 was required to yield a final purified protein preparation at ∼15 mg/ml in purification buffer containing 10% sucrose (w/v), 10 mM DTT and 0.01% (w/v) LMNG. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (BioRad, Munich, Germany) using a BSA standard. This procedure reproducibly resulted in a yield of 15-20 mg purified yeast FAS.
For γ subunit purification, 7 g of cells were resuspended in 42 mL of resuspension buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10 mM benzamidine). After addition of 2 U/ml DNase and 0.33 mg/ml lysozyme, the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were lysed by passing twice through an Avestin Emulsiflex C3 fluidizer (Avestin, Mannheim, Germany) at 15,000 PSI. The obtained lysate was centrifuged (30 min, 50,000 g, 4°C) and filtered through Minisart NML Plus cellulose-acetate syringe filters with a 0.45 μm pore size (Sartorius). The cleared lysate was loaded onto a Ni-NTA gravity column (5 mL bed volume) pre-equilibrated with 20 column volumes (CV) of resuspension buffer. The column was washed with 20 CV resuspension buffer, followed by 20 CV of washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10 mM benzamidine). For elution of the bound γ subunit, 5 CV of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10 mM benzamidine) were applied and collected in 2 mL fractions. The elution fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, the γ subunit containing fractions pooled, and the protein concentration photometrically determined (MW = 17.4 kDa, ε 280 = 5960). To cleave the N-terminal His 6 -TEV-tag, TEV-protease was added to the protein in an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:50 followed by dialysis overnight in 5 l dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM β-ME, 100 mM NaCl) at 4°C. The digested γ subunit was applied to a Ni-NTA column, which was pre-equlilibrated with 20 CV dialysis buffer. The flow-through was collected in 2 mL fractions and single fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing pure γ subunit were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml using a 10 kDa MWCO Amicon Ultra 15 centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). The final protein was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
For further kinetic and structural investigations, purified γ subunit was thawed and dialysed into the kinetic assay buffer (0.05 M BisTris pH 6.5, 0.05 M potassium acetate, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate) at 4°C using 6-8 kDa MWCO Dialyzer Mini D-Tubes (Millipore).
FAS/γ subunit complex (0.52 mg) was loaded on linear 10%–45% (w/v) sucrose gradients in purification buffer (0.05 M BisTris pH 6.5, 0.05 M potassium acetate, 0.01 M magnesium acetate) containing 10mM DTT supplemented with either 0, 100, or 200 mM KCl. The gradients were centrifuged at 120,000 x g for 16h at 4°C and were harvested in 200 μl fractions. All fractions of the gradients at the three salt concentrations were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
To determine the binding affinity of the γ subunit to the FAS, γ subunit was fluorescently labeled with NHS-Rhodamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by passage through a desalting column to remove excess unreacted dye. Different concentrations of NHS-Rhodamine labeled γ subunit were added to 40 pmol Δγ-FAS in assay buffer (0.05 M BisTris pH 6.5, 0.05 M potassium acetate, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate) in a total reaction volume of 40 μl. The mix was incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes. 10 μl of each reaction mix were then loaded onto a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel (in 0.5X TBE, 2 mM MgCl 2 ) and run at 75 mA for 2 hours at 4°C. The fluorescence signal from the FAS/γ subunit complex was imaged using an Amersham imager 600 (GE Healthcare) and quantified using the ImageJ software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 45. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each data point was measured in triplicate and the mean and SD were calculated. The dissociation constant of the γ subunit was calculated using the Hill Equation 1 , or, alternatively, using a quadratic Equation 2 described below.

Steady-state kinetics of FAS-catalyzed substrate turnover in the presence or absence of the γ subunit were analyzed spectrophotometrically (V-750 UV-Visible spectrophotometer, Jasco Instruments) in a continuous assay monitoring NADPH consumption at 340 nm and 30°C. Substrate concentration dependence was studied for all three native FAS substrates: acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. Prior to use, commercially purchased acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA substrates were further purified by Reversed-Phase (RP)-HPLC (ÄKTA BASIC 900, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using a preparative column (Machery-Nagel Nucleodur® 100-5-C18, 250 mm x 21 mm, 5 μm, flow rate: 10 ml/min). UV-absorption was simultaneously detected at 215 nm, 260 nm and 280 nm, and elution was performed using a linear gradient from 100% A (water + 0.1% (v/v) TFA) to 100% B (79.9% acetonitrile (v/v) + 20% ddH2O + 0.1% (v/v) TFA). The peak fractions of the corresponding substrates were collected, lyophilized and stored at −80°C until use. Substrate concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the known molar extinction coefficients (NADPH: ε 340 = 6220 M -1 cm -1 ; acetyl-CoA: ε 260 = 15400 M -1 cm -1 ; malonyl-CoA: ε 260 = 15400 M -1 cm -1 ).
In order to analyze the concentration dependence for the substrate acetyl-CoA, the concentrations of malonyl-CoA (120 μM), and NADPH (320 μM) were kept constant and saturating, and acetyl-CoA concentrations were varied between 0-300 μM. In the case of malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA (180 μM) and NADPH (320 μM) were kept constant and saturating, and malonyl-CoA concentrations were varied between 0-240 μM. For the analysis of the concentration dependence of NADPH, acetyl-CoA (180 μM) and malonyl-CoA (120 μM) were kept constant and saturating, and NADPH concentrations were varied between 0-320 μM. All kinetic measurements were performed after pre-incubation of 0.254 μM FAS either with or without 127 μM of the γ subunit for a total of 30 min at 30°C. The final assay mixture contained 12.7 nM FAS in complex with or without 6.35 μM γ subunit, either 0.2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor for non-crowding conditions or 20 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor as crowding conditions, kinetic assay buffer (0.05 M BisTris pH 6.5, 0.05 M potassium acetate, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate), the substrate concentrations indicated above, and 10% ( w / v ) sucrose. The reaction mix was incubated for 1 min at 30°C and the enzymatic reaction was then started by the addition of the substrate malonyl-CoA. Each data point was measured in triplicate and the mean and SD were calculated. In case of substrates acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, we estimated the initial rates by linear regression of the absorbance changes at 340 nm between 0 and 5 s. In the case of co-substrate NADPH, we used Equation 3 that accounts for a time-dependent transition from a less active to a more active species: 𝐴 3 4 0 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐴 0 − Δ ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 ⋅ 𝑡 + Δ ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 − Δ 0 𝑘 o b s ⋅ [ 1 − e x p ( − 𝑘 o b s ⋅ 𝑡 ) ] (3) Here, A 0 denotes the starting absorbance, Δ ss the absorbance change at steady-state (steady-state rate), Δ 0 the absorbance change at t = 0 (initial rate), and k obs the first-order rate constant of activation. In order to reliably define the period of FAS activation, we routinely calculated the 1 st derivative for all progress curves allowing us to differentiate FAS activation from the onset of substrate depletion (see Figure S3 ).
Thus obtained initial and steady-state rates were analyzed using either the Hill equation (NADPH, Equation 4 ), or modified Hill equations taking into account substrate-excess inhibition as observed for acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA ( Equations 5 and 6 ) ( Müller et al., 2015 35.

In Equation 5 , α is assumed to be zero, while it is non-zero in Equation 6 .
For reconstitution of the FAS/γ subunit complex, a 100-fold excess of the γ subunit was added to 4 μM Δγ-FAS and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The protein was then loaded on 10%–45% (w/v) sucrose gradients in purification buffer containing 10 mM DTT, and then centrifuged at 64,000 x g for 16 h at 4°C to remove unbound excess γ subunit. Gradients were harvested in 400 μl fractions. We then used SDS-PAGE to identify fractions containing FAS/γ subunit complex. Selected fractions were pooled and precipitated by the addition of 40% (v/v) PEG400. After centrifugation (30,000 x g, 30 minutes), the supernatant was removed and the precipitate was resuspended in purification buffer containing 10% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mM DTT and 0.01% (w/v) LMNG to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml.
EM grids were prepared using both Δγ-FAS and FAS/γ subunit complexes at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The particles were adsorbed to a continuous carbon film attached to a Quantifoil (3,5/1) (Quantifoil, Jena, Germany) grid for 2 min at 4°C. The grid was then transferred to a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermofisher, Germany) plunge-freezer, where it was vitrified after blotting for 8 s at 4°C and 100% humidity.
For γ subunit titration experiments, 1.5 mg/ml Δγ-FAS solution was used and recombinant, purified γ subunit was titrated in 0-, 2-, 6-, 24-, and 96-fold excess. The protein mix was incubated at 30°C for 30 min and then kept at 4°C. 4 μl of each sample was applied to freshly glow-discharged Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools, Jena, Germany) followed by plunge freezing as described above.
Data were acquired on a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 kV using either a Falcon 3 (integrated mode) camera or a K2 summit (counting mode) camera (Gatan, Inc.). Data collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table S2 . The acquired movies were motion corrected and dose weighted using Motioncor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 63. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) with all the frames split into 5X5 patches. The aligned frames were used to perform per micrograph CTF estimation using GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 62. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle selection was done using Gautomatch (from Dr. K. Zhang). All subsequent image processing steps were performed with Relion 3.0 ( Scheres, 2012; Zivanov et al., 2018 44. Scheres, S.H.W. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ), unless otherwise specified ( Figures S5 and S6 ). The extracted particles were subjected to 3 rounds of reference free 2D classification to remove bad/empty images. The remaining particles were refined with a mask around the central wheel using D3 symmetry. EMDB-1623 ( Gipson et al., 2010 16. Gipson, P. ∙ Mills, D.J. ∙ Wouts, R. ... Direct structural insight into the substrate-shuttling mechanism of yeast fatty acid synthase by electron cryomicroscopy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :9164-9169 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) was low pass filtered to 30 Å and used as reference for all 3D refinement and 3D classification procedures. The refined particles were then classified without alignment, with a mask around the two domes. The conformation of the dome was consistent among the different classes obtained, however, it was well resolved only in one class which consisted of ∼50%–60% of the particles used for classification. The particles from the 3D class displaying the best resolution were selected and used for one more round of 3D refinement and classification as performed before. The data further classified into 3 main classes. The particles belonging to their respective classes were refined resulting in structures with resolutions of 3.5 Å or below. Even though all the 3 classes were at comparable resolutions, their local resolutions, especially in the dome region of the molecule were very different. Only one class displayed high resolution details throughout the whole molecule. Finally, the particles belonging to this class were selected and used to perform CTF refinement (and particle polishing for the FAS/γ subunit complex dataset) followed by 3D refinement. The final refinement step was performed by applying different symmetries (C1-, C3- or D3 symmetry) to check for any structural artifacts that might be introduced due to the applied symmetry.
The data were processed as described above until the first classification step. For this analysis, batches of ∼100,000 particles were classified into 15 classes. The particles belonging to each class were selected and refined again without applying any masks. The refined 3D volumes from each dataset (a total of 165) were then used for the conformational landscape analysis as previously described ( Haselbach et al., 2017, 2018 20. Haselbach, D. ∙ Schrader, J. ∙ Lambrecht, F. ... Long-range allosteric regulation of the human 26S proteasome by 20S proteasome-targeting cancer drugs Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15578 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 21. Haselbach, D. ∙ Komarov, I. ∙ Agafonov, D.E. ... Structure and Conformational Dynamics of the Human Spliceosomal B act Complex Cell. 2018; 172 :454-464 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 3D volumes were first aligned in USCF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 39. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the central wheel of the molecule as the reference point. Further steps were performed in the COW software suite ( https://www.cow-em.de ). The 3D volumes were normalized and filtered to 20 Å. We then performed 3D Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The eigenvectors of the PCA hierarchically describe the major variance within the dataset and can be interpreted as the major modes of motion within the FAS molecules. The resultant eigenvectors representing the variance in the data were then used to describe each 3D volume using the following equation: 𝑋 𝑖 = ̅ 𝑋 + 𝛴 𝑛 𝑗 = 1 ⁢ 𝑎 𝑖 , 𝑗 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑖 (7) , where every volume 𝑋 𝑖 is described as a linear combination of the average volume ̅ 𝑋 and the eigenvectors 𝑒 𝑖 multiplied with the linear factor 𝑎 𝑖 , 𝑗 . The first ( 𝑒 1 ) and second ( 𝑒 2 ) eigenvectors, which depict motions of compaction and rotation of the FAS dome, respectively, were selected for calculating conformational landscapes. The particle number belonging to each class was used to calculate their free energies as multiples of the Boltzmann factor ( 𝑘 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑇 ) : Δ ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝐺 = 𝑘 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ l n ⁡ ( 𝑝 𝑖 𝑝 0 ) , (8) where 𝑇 is the absolute temperature, 𝑘 𝐵 the Boltzmann constant, 𝑝 𝑖 is the number of particles in state 𝑖 and 𝑝 0 is the number of particles in the most populated state. The linear factors of 𝑒 1 and 𝑒 2 calculated as per Equation 7 contributing to the input 3D volumes represent the x and y coordinates of the landscapes whereas the z axis represents the free energies of each class.
Δγ-FAS in purification buffer containing 10% sucrose (w/v), 10 mM DTT and 0.01% (w/v) LMNG was crystallized at 7 mg/ml by mixing 1 μl protein + 1 μl crystallization buffer A (0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0, 0.3 M sodium-malonate pH 7.0, 11.5%–13% (w/v) PEG3350) in Crystalgen hanging drop diffusion plates (Jena Bioscience, Germany) over a 750 μl reservoir of crystallization buffer A. For the FAS/γ subunit complex, a 7-fold molar excess of γ subunit (in the buffer used for Δγ-FAS) was added to a 7 mg/ml protein solution of Δγ-FAS and incubated for 30 minutes at 30°C. The reconstituted complex was then crystallized by mixing 1 μl protein + 1 μl crystallization buffer B (0.1 M MES pH 6.2, 0.15-0.3 M ammonium sulfate, 7%–8% (w/v) PEG 8000) in Chryschem sitting drop vapor diffusion plates (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, USA) over a 500 μl reservoir of crystallization buffer B. The crystals took 3-7 days to grow at 18°C and were usually around 150 × 200 × 200 μm in size.
The crystals obtained were transferred to 4°C by gradually decreasing the temperature in a linear manner over 48 h using a Rumed® E100 incubator (Rubarth Apparate GmbH, Germany). Stabilization and dehydration procedures were performed as following: 1) The drop was unsealed and 2 μl of the reservoir solution was added to the drop. Then 2 μl of crystal stabilization buffer A (0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0, 0.3 M sodium malonate pH 7.0, 15% (w/v) PEG3350) for Δγ-FAS and stabilization buffer B (0.1 M MES pH 6.2, 0.3 M ammonium sulfate, 12% (w/v) PEG 8000) for the FAS/γ subunit complex was added. 2) 2 μl of the respective crystal stabilization buffer containing 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol was added followed by removal of 2 μl of solution from the drop. Then 2 μl of the respective crystal stabilization buffer containing 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol was again added to the drop. This procedure was repeated with the respective crystal stabilization buffer containing 10% and then 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol. 3) The reservoir solution was exchanged for the respective crystal stabilization buffer containing 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and the drop was resealed. The crystals were then allowed to equilibrate by vapor diffusion in excess of 16 h.
The crystals were harvested in Spine Litholoops (Molecular Dimensions, Suffolk, UK or Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany) mounted on magnetic pins, and vitrified by plunge-cooling in liquid nitrogen. The data were collected on EMBL beamline P14 at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) using a MD3 vertical-spindle diffractometer (EMBL and Arinax, Moirans, France) and an EIGER 16M detector (Dectris, Baden, Switzerland). A white beam refractive lens transfocator and slits were used to obtain homogeneous X-ray beams which matched the crystal dimensions ( Schrader et al., 2016 46. Schrader, J. ∙ Henneberg, F. ∙ Mata, R.A. ... The inhibition mechanism of human 20S proteasomes enables next-generation inhibitor design Science. 2016; 353 :594-598 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Diffraction data were scaled and integrated with the XDS program package ( Kabsch, 2010 25. Kabsch, W. XDS Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12932) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Initial phases for Δγ-FAS were determined by molecular replacement performed with MOLREP ( Vagin and Teplyakov, 2010 53. Vagin, A. ∙ Teplyakov, A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :22-25 Crossref Scopus (3010) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS structure (PDB ID: 2UV8 ) ( Leibundgut et al., 2007 28. Leibundgut, M. ∙ Jenni, S. ∙ Frick, C. ... Structural basis for substrate delivery by acyl carrier protein in the yeast fatty acid synthase Science. 2007; 316 :288-290 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was built and optimized by several rounds of interactive manual model building in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 10. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot : model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refinement in Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 36. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (6737) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, TLS refinement was performed, where each TLS domain was defined by individual enzymatic domains. The obtained structure displays excellent stereochemistry with 19.7 % / 21.8% (R work /R free ) ( Table S2 ). Analysis of the diffraction data with the STARANISO server indicated mild anisotropy. This suggested anisotropic scaling and truncation of the data should allow for better refinement of the model. This was indeed the case and resulted in a final model with lower average B-factors and 19.2 % / 21.1 % (R work /R free ; Table S2 ).
The refined Δγ-FAS crystal structure was used to determine the initial phases by molecular replacement with MOLREP ( Vagin and Teplyakov, 2010 53. Vagin, A. ∙ Teplyakov, A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :22-25 Crossref Scopus (3010) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the FAS/γ subunit complex diffraction data. The obtained density map was found to correlate better with the FAS/γ subunit complex model (as determined by cryo-EM) rather than the Δγ-FAS structure. Therefore, we used the model of α and β subunits from the FAS/γ subunit complex cryo-EM model in initial refinement of the X-ray data. Notably, the ACP domain and the γ subunit were removed from the structure prior to refinement to avoid introducing a phase bias. After several rounds of rigid body refinement in Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 36. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (6737) PubMed Google Scholar ), difference densities corresponding to the ACP domain and γ subunit next to the AT and ER domain, respectively could be easily identified. The missing domains were then placed into their respective densities followed by additional rounds of refinement using Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 10. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot : model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 36. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (6737) PubMed Google Scholar ). Owing to the resolution of the FAS/γ subunit complex structure, we have chosen to deposit the structure as a poly-Ala trace only.
The crystallographic Δγ-FAS model was used as the initial model for both the Δγ-FAS and FAS/γ subunit complex structures determined by cryo-EM. It was docked into the EM densities as a rigid body using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 39. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ). An additional round of rigid body refinement was then performed in Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 36. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (6737) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model then underwent several rounds of manual modeling in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 10. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot : model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refinement in Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 36. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (6737) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Models for the γ subunit were generated by interactive modeling based on side-chain densities in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 10. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot : model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cross-validated models generated based on sequence homology using the Robetta prediction server ( Kim et al., 2004 26. Kim, D.E. ∙ Chivian, D. ∙ Baker, D. Protein structure prediction and analysis using the Robetta server Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 W526-31 Crossref Scopus (1548) Google Scholar ). The model was additionally cross-validated using the cross-linking data. There were two unstructured regions (60-76, 114-132) of this protein that could not be confidently modeled.
For the final refinement and validation of the models, we used the maps reconstructed using D3 symmetry as they had the best resolution. Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between the refined model and the map was calculated (FSC sum ). The model was also refined using the first unfiltered half-map. This model was then compared to the first half map (FSC work ) as well as to the second half-map (FSC free ) to check for signs of overfitting. All figures were made using Pymol ( Schrödinger, 2015 47. Schrödinger, L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schrödinger, LLC, 2015 Google Scholar ), Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 39. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 17. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2591) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Phosphorylated peptides were enriched following the EasyPhos ( Humphrey et al., 2015 22. Humphrey, S.J. ∙ Azimifar, S.B. ∙ Mann, M. High-throughput phosphoproteomics reveals in vivo insulin signaling dynamics Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :990-995 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ) method with changes. In brief, peptides were resuspended in 1050 μL of 228 mM KCl, 3.9 mM KH2PO4, 38% ACN (v/v) and 4.5% TFA (v/v). For phosphopeptide enrichment, peptides were incubated with TiO2 beads for 20 min at 40°C at a beads-to-protein ratio of 10:1. Beads were washed three times with 60% ACN/1% TFA. Elution was performed twice with 40% ACN/3.75% NH4OH (v/v) on empty spin columns (Harvard Apparatus). Subsequently, the pH of the eluate was adjusted to 2 by adding TFA, dried and desalted by using C18 spin columns (Harvard apparatus).
Phosphorylated peptides were measured on a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS1 resolution was set to 120,000, AGC target to 1 × 10 6 , maximum IT to 50 ms. The 30 most abundant precursor ions were fragmented using HCD with an NCE of 30%. MS2 scans were acquired with a resolution of 30,000, an AGC target of 5 × 10 5 and a maximum IT of 128 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 45 s. The liquid chromatography gradient was similar to the one used for the cross-linked peptides but adapted to a 90 min method, starting with 10% B.
Raw files were analyzed by MaxQuant (v. 1.6.0.1) ( Cox and Mann, 2008 7. Cox, J. ∙ Mann, M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26 :1367-1372 Crossref Scopus (10772) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default settings and phosphorylation as variable modification on serines, threonines and tyrosines. Protein sequences of the FAS γ subunit were taken from UniProt and used as database. All phosphorylation sites that were identified for the γ subunit had a localization probability higher than 0.94.
We analyzed the purified FAS/γ subunit complex by crosslinking mass spectrometry. The protein complex was incubated with 1 mM of BS3 crosslinker (from a 100mM stock in DMSO) for 30 min at 30°C. The reaction was quenched with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (from a 1 M stock). Proteins were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM dithiothreitol and 40 mM iodoacetamide, respectively. In the presence of 1 M urea, proteins were digested by trypsin in an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:50 at 37°C overnight. Peptides were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) added to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v), desalted on MicroSpin Colums (Harvard Apparatus) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and vacuum dried. Peptides were resuspended in 50 μL of 30% acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) TFA before enriching of cross-linked species by peptide size exclusion (SuperdexPeptide 3.2/300 column, GE Healthcare). Fractions of 50 μL were collected and those that eluted first and contain the cross-linked peptide pairs were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
Cross-linked peptides of the first replicate were measured in technical duplicates on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an in-house-packed C 18 column (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm pore size, 75 μm inner diameter, 30 cm length, Dr. Maisch GmbH). Samples were separated by applying the following gradient: mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid (v/v), mobile phase B of 80% acetonitrile/0.08% formic acid (v/v). The gradient started at 5% B, increasing to 12, 15 or 20% B within 3 min (according to fraction), followed by a continuous increase to 48% B within 45 min, then keeping B constant at 90% for 8 min. After each run the column was again equilibrated to 5% B for 2 min. The flow rate was set to 300 nL/min. MS1 survey scans were acquired in the orbitrap (OT) with a resolution of 120,000, an injection time (IT) of 60 ms and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 5 × 10 5 . Dynamic exclusion (DE) was set to 10 s and only charge states between 3 and 8 were considered for fragmentation. MS2 spectra were acquired in the OT of the 20 most abundant precursor ions, resolution 30,000, IT 120 ms and AGC target 5 × 10 4 . Fragmentation was enforced by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at 30% normalized collision energy (NCE). The second replicate was treated with the following changes: we used a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), at MS1 the IT was set to 50 ms and the AGC target to 1 × 10 6 . At MS2, the IT was set to 128 ms and the AGC target to 1 × 10 5 . DE covered 30 ms. Here, the 30 most abundant precursor ions were considered for fragmentation.
ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for converting.raw files into .mgf format (signal-to-noise ratio 1.5, 1000–10000 Da precursor mass). The generated .mgf files were subjected to pLink v. 1.23 ( Yang et al., 2012 60. Yang, B. ∙ Wu, Y.J. ∙ Zhu, M. ... Identification of cross-linked peptides from complex samples Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :904-906 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify cross-linked peptides. Here, default settings were applied with carbamidomethylation of cysteines as a fixed and oxidation of methionines as a variable modification, the FDR was set to 0.01. Spectra of inter-cross-links between FAS and the γ subunit within the first replicate were evaluated manually. For the second replicate, a score cut-off of 3 (-log 10 transformation of the original pLink score) was applied and only cross-links supported by more than one cross-linked peptide spectrum match (CSMs) were considered.
Each data point to determine the binding affinity of the γ subunit and for the enzyme kinetics measurements in this paper were measured in triplicate. For binding affinity measurements, the fluorescence of FAS-bound γ subunit measured in agarose gels using an Amersham imager 600 and quantified using the ImageJ software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 45. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). No data points were omitted. The mean and SD for n = 3 measurements per data point were calculated. In the case of enzyme kinetics triplicate measurements were individually used to determine the initial rates by linear regression of the absorbance changes using Sigmaplot (Systat Software Inc.), the mean and SD for n = 3 initial rates obtained in this manner at each data point were then calculated. No data points were omitted. The actual triplicate measurements to determine enzyme hysteresis are shown for one datapoint in Figure S2 .
The COW software is currently in an open beta test phase and can be downloaded from https://www.cow-em.de upon registration.
The coordinates for the determined structures are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB accession codes 6QL5, 6QL6, 6QL7 and 6QL9). EM structures are deposited with the EMDB (accession codes 4577, 4578).
