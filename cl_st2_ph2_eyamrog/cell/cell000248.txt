Title: Multi-Omics Resolves a Sharp Disease-State Shift between Mild and Moderate COVID-19


Abstract: Summary

We present an integrated analysis of the clinical measurements, immune cells, and plasma multi-omics of 139 COVID-19 patients representing all levels of disease severity, from serial blood draws collected during the first week of infection following diagnosis. We identify a major shift between mild and moderate disease, at which point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied by the loss of specific classes of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within this stressed plasma environment at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune cell phenotypes emerge and amplify with increasing disease severity. We condensed over 120,000 immune features into a single axis to capture how different immune cell classes coordinate in response to SARS-CoV-2. This immune-response axis independently aligns with the major plasma composition changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that moderate disease may provide the most effective setting for therapeutic intervention.

Section: Introduction

The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has rapidly spread to become a global health challenge, with over 38 million cases and over 1 million associated fatalities as reported through mid-October 2020. 20%–31% of symptomatic patients require hospitalization, with intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates ranging from 4.9%–11.5%, and fatality rates ranging from 2%–10% ( Iype and Gulati, 2020 36. Iype, E. ∙ Gulati, S. Understanding the asymmetric spread and case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 among countries medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Patients with more severe COVID-19 infections are distinguished by significant immune dysregulation, the nature of which is incompletely understood.
Most reports on immune dysfunction in COVID-19 patients have focused on severe disease. In particular, studies on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using single-cell analytics, have revealed phenomena that tracked with disease severity, including robust HLA class II downregulation on monocytes ( Wilk et al., 2020 97. Wilk, A.J. ∙ Rustagi, A. ∙ Zhao, N.Q. ... A single-cell atlas of the peripheral immune response in patients with severe COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1070-1076 Crossref Scopus (712) PubMed Google Scholar ), lymphopenia ( Cao, 2020 17. Cao, X. COVID-19: immunopathology and its implications for therapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :269-270 Crossref Scopus (963) PubMed Google Scholar ), immune cell exhaustion ( Zheng et al., 2020 105. Zheng, M. ∙ Gao, Y. ∙ Wang, G. ... Functional exhaustion of antiviral lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2020; 17 :533-535 Crossref Scopus (1071) PubMed Google Scholar ), and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines ( Del Valle et al., 2020 20. Del Valle, D.M. ∙ Kim-Schulze, S. ∙ Huang, H.-H. ... An inflammatory cytokine signature predicts COVID-19 severity and survival Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1636-1643 Crossref Scopus (1046) PubMed Google Scholar ). Larger patient population studies have revealed abnormal myeloid cell subsets in severe COVID-19 ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 71. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ...

Arunachalam, P.S. ∙ Wimmers, F. ∙ Mok, C.K.P. ... Systems biological assessment of immunity to mild versus severe COVID-19 infection in humans Science. 2020; 369 :1210-1220 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Mathew et al. (2020) 57.

Lucas, C. ∙ Wong, P. ∙ Klein, J. ..., Yale IMPACT Team Longitudinal analyses reveal immunological misfiring in severe COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 584 :463-469 Crossref Scopus (991) PubMed Google Scholar reported on maladapted cytokine profiles associated with severe COVID-19, including immune dysregulation arising from impaired type I interferon (IFN) response associated with elevated interleukin (IL)-6 ( Hadjadj et al., 2020 26. Hadjadj, J. ∙ Yatim, N. ∙ Barnabei, L. ... Impaired type I interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients Science. 2020; 369 :718-724 Crossref Scopus (1446) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dysregulated plasma metabolites have been reported for serious infection ( Shen et al., 2020 72. Shen, B. ∙ Yi, X. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Proteomic and Metabolomic Characterization of COVID-19 Patient Sera Cell. 2020; 182 :59-72 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of course, inflammation and immune activation are expected to accompany a viral infection, but understanding the coupling between elevated inflammation signals, plasma metabolite composition, and immune cell dysfunction requires a full characterization of both plasma and PBMCs in large cohorts of COVID-19 patients representing the spectrum of infection severities.
We characterized the circulating immune cell classes and the plasma multi-omic profiles from a cohort of 139 COVID-19 patients (265 samples from 2 longitudinal blood draws per patient) and 258 healthy donors. We interpret that data through the patients’ clinical features extracted from their electronic health records (EHR) ( Figure 1 A). One blood draw was collected shortly after the initial clinical diagnosis (time = T1), and the second was collected a few days later (T2) ( Figure S1 A). For each draw, the plasma levels of around 500 proteins and 1,000 metabolites were quantified along with single-cell multi-omic analyses of PBMCs in which whole transcriptome, 192 surface proteins, 32 secreted proteins, and T cell and B cell receptor gene sequences were measured ( Figure 1 A).

Section: Results

The participating COVID-19 patients exhibited a range of clinical phenotypes, including many that exhibited statistically significant correlations with disease severity (quantified by the World Health Organization [WHO] ordinal scale [WOS]) ( World Health Organization, 2020 101. World Health Organization COVID-19 Therapeutic Trial Synopsis World Health Organization, 2020 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B). Some correlations, including C-reactive protein (CRP) ( Li et al., 2020 48. Li, Q. ∙ Ding, X. ∙ Xia, G. ... Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study EClinicalMedicine. 2020; 23 :100375 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), immature granulocyte count ( Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020 42. Kuri-Cervantes, L. ∙ Pampena, M.B. ∙ Meng, W. ... Comprehensive mapping of immune perturbations associated with severe COVID-19 Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 :eabd7114 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ), D-dimer ( Mathew et al., 2020 57. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ... Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 :eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and segmented neutrophils ( Huang et al., 2020 33. Huang, C. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, X. ... Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China Lancet. 2020; 395 :497-506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27221) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been previously reported ( Figures 1 B and S1 B). Clinical metadata for these COVID-19 patients and healthy donors are presented in Tables S1.1–S1.2 .
Analyzed plasma proteins and metabolites are listed in Tables S1.3–S1.4 . Measurements of the same metabolites from Metabolon and clinical labs (EHR data) were highly correlated ( Figure S1 C). Principal component analysis (PCA) of both datasets, using both principal component (PC) 1 and PC2, resolved shifts in these plasma profiles in stepwise comparisons (healthy donors [WOS = 0] versus mild [WOS = 1–2]; mild versus moderate [WOS = 3–4], and moderate versus severe [WOS = 5–7]) ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S1 D, and S1E). Proteomic PC1, which separated healthy donors and COVID-19 patients ( Figure S1 D), contains pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., CXCL6) and proteins associated with immune cell activation (e.g., CD244 and CD40) as high contributing factors ( Table S1.5 ), implying immune activation in even mild COVID-19 cases. Proteomic PC2 distinguished mild from moderate patients ( Figure S1 D), which are differentiated by whether hospitalization is required ( World Health Organization, 2020 101. World Health Organization COVID-19 Therapeutic Trial Synopsis World Health Organization, 2020 Google Scholar ). The alterations in protein profiles can be appreciated by comparing the numbers of proteins significantly changed for each step in disease severity ( Figure 1 C, right panel). The highest number of significant protein changes were observed in the transition from healthy donors to mild infections (n = 307 proteins with only 27 downregulated, Table S1.6 ). A comparison of mild to moderate revealed relatively fewer changes (n = 132 total with 91 downregulated, Table S1.6 ), while few proteins changed from moderate to severe disease (n = 5, all upregulated, Table S1.6 ). Consistent with previous literature ( Lucas et al., 2020 52. Lucas, C. ∙ Wong, P. ∙ Klein, J. ..., Yale IMPACT Team Longitudinal analyses reveal immunological misfiring in severe COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 584 :463-469 Crossref Scopus (991) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified the upregulation of CCL7, IL-10, and IL-6 (that barely misses significance between moderate and severe disease with p = 0.056) ( Figures 1 C, right panel, and S1 F; Table S1.6 ). Keratin-19 (KRT19), which is involved in the organization of muscle fibers ( Stone et al., 2007 77. Stone, M.R. ∙ O’Neill, A. ∙ Lovering, R.M. ... Absence of keratin 19 in mice causes skeletal myopathy with mitochondrial and sarcolemmal reorganization J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120 :3999-4008 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), is upregulated in all comparisons ( Figures 1 C, right panel, and S1 F; Table S1.6 ) and may be a marker of tissue damage. This analysis suggests a striking similarity between moderate and severe COVID-19 cases.
Metabolomic PC1 resolved mild from moderate cases, while PC2 distinguished healthy and COVID-19 patients ( Figure S1 E). These changes were evaluated by the metabolic-change scores, which consider the sum of the fold changes observed in classes of metabolites ( Figure 1 D, right panel). From healthy to mild COVID-19, upregulated metabolites included molecules associated with amino acid (up = 58 versus down = 8), nucleotide (up = 14 versus down = 2), and carbohydrate (up = 11 versus down = 0) metabolism ( Table S1.6 ), with lipids slightly more downregulated (up = 61 versus down = 79). Interestingly, for mild to moderate and moderate to severe transitions, there is a clear preference toward downregulation of lipids, which agrees with previous reports ( Shen et al., 2020 72. Shen, B. ∙ Yi, X. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Proteomic and Metabolomic Characterization of COVID-19 Patient Sera Cell. 2020; 182 :59-72 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ), and amino acid metabolites, which recalls reports of amino acid catabolism for severe COVID-19 ( Thomas et al., 2020 85. Thomas, T. ∙ Stefanoni, D. ∙ Reisz, J.A. ... COVID-19 infection alters kynurenine and fatty acid metabolism, correlating with IL-6 levels and renal status JCI Insight. 2020; 5 :e140327 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 D, right panel, and S1 G; Table S1.6 ). Disruption of xenobiotic metabolism appears mostly associated with severe disease; the upstream xenobiotic benzoate is elevated while downstream products, such as catechol sulfate and 3-hydroxyhippurate, are repressed ( Figure S1 G; Table S1.6 ). Benzoate level may point to hepatic injury, because liver is the principal site for such metabolism ( Alqahtani and Schattenberg, 2020 6. Alqahtani, S.A. ∙ Schattenberg, J.M. Liver injury in COVID-19: The current evidence United European Gastroenterol. J. 2020; 8 :509-519 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the global metabolic profile alterations point to a major shift between mild and moderate cases with a disproportionate loss of several classes of circulating metabolites.
We explore the relationships between plasma analytes, clinical measures, and disease severity (WOS) in the circos interaction plot of Figure 1 E. Linkages shown are analyte-analyte associations with significant (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.001) interaction effects with WOS (see STAR Methods ). A representative severity-dependent linkage (IL-6 versus a lysoplasmalogen) is shown in Figure 1 F. These interactions reveal many new insights. For example, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (in hospitalized patients) has many connections with amino acid metabolism ( Figures 1 E and S1 H, left panels), suggesting amino acid catabolism in advanced COVID-19 ( Thomas et al., 2020 85. Thomas, T. ∙ Stefanoni, D. ∙ Reisz, J.A. ... COVID-19 infection alters kynurenine and fatty acid metabolism, correlating with IL-6 levels and renal status JCI Insight. 2020; 5 :e140327 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Several inflammation-associated proteins, including CCL7 and IL-6, are anti-correlated with many plasma lipids ( Figures 1 E and S1 H, middle and right panels). For healthy donors or mildly infected patients, these lipid levels exhibit a range of values ( Figure S1 I). However, between mild and moderate infection, the lipid levels drop precipitously ( Figure S1 I). This general severity-dependent trend is seen for many interactions ( Table S1.7 ). For example, out of the 32 significant connections of IL-6 in the circos plot, 29 are with lipids, and all negatively correlate with WOS ( Table S1.7 ). The circos plot suggests that increased inflammatory signals are accompanied by a loss of metabolic resources and a drop in xenobiotic metabolism, seemingly reflecting a stressed environment that may influence the immune response in COVID-19 patients.
We further explored how COVID-19 severity is reflected in circulating immune cells. The PBMC single-cell transcriptome data were visualized as a two-dimensional (2D) projection via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) ( Becht et al., 2018 11. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37 :38-44 Crossref Scopus (1558) Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 K, left panel). No major batch effects were revealed ( Figures S1 J and S1K, right panel).
Relative percentages of different cell types were assessed relative to increasing WOS ( Figures 1 G and S1 L). Consistent with previous reports ( Mathew et al., 2020 57. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ... Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 :eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2020 76. Song, J.-W. ∙ Zhang, C. ∙ Fan, X. ... Immunological and inflammatory profiles in mild and severe cases of COVID-19 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3410 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed a drop in the relative percentage of lymphocytes, including CD4 + T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and especially CD8 + T cells ( Figures 1 G and S1 L). By contrast, monocyte percentages were elevated ( Figure 1 G). B cell percentages did not significantly vary with WOS ( Figure S1 L), consistent with previous reports ( Zhang et al., 2020 104. Zhang, J.-Y. ∙ Wang, X.-M. ∙ Xing, X. ... Single-cell landscape of immunological responses in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1107-1118 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). Healthy and mild participants exhibit similar immune cell compositions ( Figure S1 L), although mild and moderate disease exhibited the most significant changes ( Figure 1 G, p < 0.0001 for both). This observation aligns with the major shift we observed in plasma multi-omics between mild and moderate disease and prompted us to further investigate major immune cell types.
We projected the CD8 + T cell single-cell transcriptomic data onto a 2D UMAP and resolved nine subpopulations characterized by both protein and transcriptional signatures ( Figures 2 A, 2B, S2 A, and S2B). We identified naive, memory, effector, exhausted-like, and proliferative phenotypes. For instance, the naive-related mRNA and protein markers LEF1 , TCF7 , and CD197 were all upregulated in the red-colored cluster 3, while effector markers, such as GZMB and PRF1 , were elevated in clusters 0, 1, and 2 ( Figures 2 A, 2C, S2 A, and S2B). The protein levels yielded a consistent picture. For example, the naive-like cluster 1 displayed a high CD45RA/CD45RO ratio and effector-like clusters 0, 1, and 2 displayed intermediate levels ( Figure 2 B). Exhausted CD8 + T cells have been documented in COVID-19 patients ( Diao et al., 2020 21. Diao, B. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Tan, Y. ... Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :827 Crossref Scopus (1284) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, indeed, exhaustion markers LAG3 and TIGIT were upregulated in both effector clusters (0 and 2) ( Figures 2 A, 2C, and S2 A). Such inhibitory markers are also increased after T cell activation ( Wherry, 2011 95. Wherry, E.J. T cell exhaustion Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :492-499 Crossref Scopus (2404) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wherry and Kurachi, 2015 96. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Kurachi, M. Molecular and cellular insights into T cell exhaustion Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :486-499 Crossref Scopus (2212) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may not indicate dysfunction.
Certain CD8 + subpopulations correlated with disease severity. As expected, naive-like markers and cell cluster 3 exhibited the highest density in healthy donors and decreased in COVID-19 patients ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S2 F). Effector-like cells (clusters 0, 1, and 2) were enriched in COVID-19 samples ( Figures 2 F and S2 E), also as expected ( Mathew et al., 2020 57. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ... Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 :eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, CD8 + T cells in patients who improved (defined as a decrease of WOS from T1 to T2) displayed higher levels of effector-associated transcripts such as GZMH , KLRD1 , SLC9A3R1 , etc. ( Figure S2 G; Table S2.1 ). Interestingly, the severe patients showed an increase of naive clusters and a decrease in activated effector T cells ( Figures 2 F and S2 E) relative to moderate disease. Such non-monotonic change of T cell activation status with disease severity may resolve conflicting reports of both positive and negative correlations of T cell activation with disease severity ( Lucas et al., 2020 52. Lucas, C. ∙ Wong, P. ∙ Klein, J. ..., Yale IMPACT Team Longitudinal analyses reveal immunological misfiring in severe COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 584 :463-469 Crossref Scopus (991) PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2020 76. Song, J.-W. ∙ Zhang, C. ∙ Fan, X. ... Immunological and inflammatory profiles in mild and severe cases of COVID-19 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3410 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ) and underscores the importance of analyzing large patient cohorts in distinct disease stages to accurately sample the heterogeneity of COVID-19 disease manifestation.
Cluster 8 displayed intermediate levels of effector markers, upregulated exhaustion markers ( LAG3 , TIGIT , and CD279), and, counterintuitively, exclusively expresses proliferation markers ( MKI67 and TYMS ) ( Figures 2 A, 2C, S2 A, and S2B). In fact, transcript levels of exhaustion marker PDCD1 showed a positive correlation with MKI67 for cluster 8 cells ( Figure 2 H). Cluster 8 also displays high cytotoxic signatures and has not fully lost its naive signature ( Figure 2 G). This subpopulation emerges at the stage of moderate disease ( Figure 2 E). The relative percentages of this hybrid proliferative-exhausted phenotype were confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure S2 H). This may reflect the proliferative hierarchy that maintains the exhausted T cells, which has been observed in chronic infections and cancer ( Bengsch et al., 2018 12. Bengsch, B. ∙ Ohtani, T. ∙ Khan, O. ...

Progenitor and terminal subsets of CD8+ T cells cooperate to contain chronic viral infection Science. 2012; 338 :1220-1225 Crossref Scopus (570) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Pathway analysis of cluster 8 cells revealed that genes regulated by the MYC and the regulation of RUNX3 activity were both enriched ( Figure S2 I; Table S2.2 ). This may imply that cluster 8 is comprised of early-stage activated T cells, because MYC is rapidly but transiently induced during the early stage of activation ( Nie et al., 2012 63. Nie, Z. ∙ Hu, G. ∙ Wei, G. ... c-Myc is a universal amplifier of expressed genes in lymphocytes and embryonic stem cells Cell. 2012; 151 :68-79 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (763) PubMed Google Scholar ).
CD8 + T cell clonal expansion was enhanced in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients relative to healthy donors ( Figures 2 D and 2I). The effector-like clusters 0 and 2 showed the most clonal expansion, while T cells with a clonal expansion index of 1 were mainly within the naive-like cluster 3 ( Figures S2 C and S2D), suggesting the activated effector CD8 + T cells detected in the peripheral blood are clonally expanding, likely due to virus-antigen encounters.
Integrating the TCR and single-cell transcriptome datasets using hierarchical clustering revealed one set of TCRs (group 1) within the cytotoxic effector phenotype and a group 2 within the memory-like phenotype ( Figure 2 J). Group1 TCRs are mainly from patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 and the group2 TCRs are mostly from mild patients ( Figure 2 J). Thus, the expansion of CD8 + clones emphasizes the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease.
Polyfunctional T cells produce multiple different cytokines, can release a substantially higher amount of cytokines relative to other T cells, and can dominate an immune response ( Abel et al., 2010 1. Abel, B. ∙ Tameris, M. ∙ Mansoor, N. ... The novel tuberculosis vaccine, AERAS-402, induces robust and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in adults Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2010; 181 :1407-1417 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2015 51. Lu, Y. ∙ Xue, Q. ∙ Eisele, M.R. ...

USA. 2015; 112 :E607-E615 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2013 53. Ma, C. ∙ Cheung, A.F. ∙ Chodon, T. ... Multifunctional T-cell analyses to study response and progression in adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy Cancer Discov. 2013; 3 :418-429 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2017 106. Zhou, J. ∙ Kaiser, A. ∙ Ng, C. ... CD8+ T-cell mediated anti-malaria protection induced by malaria vaccines; assessment of hepatic CD8+ T cells by SCBC assay Hum. Vaccin. Immunother. 2017; 13 :1625-1629 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). We measured 32 secreted cytokines from individual live CD8 + T cells. Polyfunctionality, as quantified by the polyfunctional strength index (PSI = the numbers of different proteins secreted × copy numbers secreted), is similar for healthy and mild cases, but upregulated at moderate severity ( Figure 2 K), with increased frequency of cells secreting granzyme B and perforin ( Figure S2 J). Polyfunctionality is reduced in severe patients ( Figure 2 K), consistent with the peak in CD8 + effector cluster percentage for moderate cases ( Figure S2 E). Thus, peripheral CD8 + T cells in COVID-19 patients with moderate illness reflect the highest polyfunctionality and the highest percentages of effector phenotypes.
UMAP representations of single CD4 + T cell transcriptomic data are provided in Figures 3 A, 3B, S3 A, and S3B. Projecting data for COVID-19 patients grouped by disease severity revealed how CD4 + T cell phenotype is influenced by infection ( Figure 3 E). For example, naive-like cells (clusters 1 [blue] and 2 [green]), which are characterized by elevated naive-related transcripts TCF7 , CCR7 , and CD197 surface protein, were reduced in COVID-19 patients ( Figures 3 E, S3 E, and S3F), implying increased activation of CD4 + T cells with COVID-19 infection, as reported ( Mathew et al., 2020 57. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ... Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 :eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
We identified two unusual CD4 + T cell subpopulations (clusters 5 and 8) that varied with WOS. Cluster 5 cells exhibited elevated cytotoxic transcripts PRF1 and GNLY ( Figures 3 A, 3C, and S3 A) and increased in patients with moderate infections ( Figure S3 E), possibly suggesting repeated antigen exposure ( Juno et al., 2017 37. Juno, J.A. ∙ van Bockel, D. ∙ Kent, S.J. ... Cytotoxic CD4 T Cells-Friend or Foe during Viral Infection? Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :19 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, more than 95% of the highly expanded CD4 + T cell clones (defined by n ≥ 5) were in cluster 5 ( Figures 3 D, S3 C, S3D, and S3G), suggesting viral specificity for these cells. Cluster 8 expressed exhaustion markers, an elevated Th1 signature, the most elevated proliferation signature, but little clonal expansion ( Figures S3 D, S3G, and S3H). The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-derived relative percentages of the hybrid and cytotoxic CD4 + T cell clusters were both quantitatively confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figures S3 I and S3J).
Both clusters 5 and 8 exhibited unique groups of enriched genes ( Figures S3 K and S3L; Tables S3.1 and S3.2). Cytotoxic cluster 5 cells showed elevated effector memory, antigen presentation signatures, and enrichment of the complement gene set ( Figure S3 K). Hybrid cluster 8 cells showed enrichment of antigen cross presentation and cell cycle G2M transition-related gene signatures ( Figure S3 L). Interestingly, cluster 8 CD4 + T cells were highly enriched for MYC targets, similar to the hybrid CD8 + T cell cluster, suggesting a transient intermediate cell-state during early-stage activation, potentially due to rapid activation.
The functional differences of all CD4 + T cell clusters were compared by projecting single cells onto a scatterplot where the x and y axes represent the Th1 and cytotoxic signature scores, respectively ( Figure 3 F). Cells with high naive scores reside at the bottom-left ( Figure 3 F). The two unique clusters extend out toward opposite corners of the map, while other clusters align along either of the branches ( Figure 3 F). For example, cluster 6 (pink) aligns along the upper branch with cluster 5, and cluster 0 (orange) aligns with cluster 8. No significant overlap is observed between the two branches ( Figure 3 F), implying that the branches may comprise two distinct cell state destinations for a given naive CD4 + T cell. These two clusters exhibit differences in other functional signatures. Cluster 8 displays uniquely upregulated proliferation and exhaustion signatures, intermediate levels of the naive markers, and low levels of the cytotoxic signature ( Figure S3 H). In contrast, cytotoxic cluster 5 shows opposite trends for these functional signatures. Importantly, these two clusters exhibit notable differences in their TCR sharing patterns ( Figure 3 G). Cells with group 1 TCRs were uniquely enriched in cytotoxic cluster 5 ( Figure 3 G). Thus, these two unique clusters may represent distinct cell state destinations for CD4 + T cells during infection.
Polyfunctionality of single, viable CD4 + T cells revealed that CD4 + T cells from COVID-19 patients exhibit polyfunctionality relative to those from healthy donors, peaking at patients with moderate illness ( Figure 3 H). Notably, the frequencies of CD4 + T cells that can secrete the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ, Th17 cytokines IL17-A, IL17-F, Th2 cytokine IL-4, and cytotoxic molecule granzyme B are increased in COVID-19 patient samples, again peaking for moderate patients ( Figure S3 M). This recalls trends seen in CD8 + T cells, but whether this is related to T cell exhaustion in the most severe patients is unclear.
We observed significant activation in naive B cells (downregulation of FCER2 and upregulation of SLAMF7 ) and expansion of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in moderate and severe samples compared to healthy and mild samples ( Figures 4 A–4C). A distinct memory B cell population that has high expression in ITGAX and FCRL5 ( Figure 4 A), resembling a tissue-like memory B cell phenotype ( Li et al., 2016 47. Li, H. ∙ Borrego, F. ∙ Nagata, S. ... Fc Receptor-like 5 Expression Distinguishes Two Distinct Subsets of Human Circulating Tissue-like Memory B Cells J. Immunol. 2016; 196 :4064-4074 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), was found to be high in mild samples compared to healthy samples ( Figure 4 B). We found prominent downregulation of several HLA class II genes in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients ( Figure 4 C), suggesting dysregulation of immune cell crosstalk between the adaptive immune cell classes. Besides the loss of chemokine receptor CXCR5 in moderate and severe samples of COVID-19 patients ( Figure 4 D) that has been reported previously ( Mathew et al., 2020 57. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ... Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 :eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we also discovered a significant loss of chemokine receptor CCR6 in moderate and severe samples ( Figure 4 D). This could impair germinal center reactions ( Reimer et al., 2017 68. Reimer, D. ∙ Lee, A.Y.S. ∙ Bannan, J. ... Early CCR6 expression on B cells modulates germinal centre kinetics and efficient antibody responses Immunol. Cell Biol. 2017; 95 :33-41 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ultimately lead to the dysregulated humoral immunity responses found in early infection of COVID-19 ( Kaneko et al., 2020 38. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.-H. ∙ Boucau, J. ...

UMAP visualization of all monocytes shows a clear separation of non-classical monocytes (CD14 low CD16 high cluster 6), characterized by the upregulated transcripts FCGR3A , CX3CR1 , and surface protein CD16 ( Figures 5 A–5D, S4 A, and S4B). The non-classical monocyte fraction decreases in moderate and severe infections ( Figures 5 E and S4 C), compared to a reported drop in severe patients ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 71. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ...

Med. 2020; 26 :1070-1076 Crossref Scopus (712) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the classical monocyte clusters (CD14 high CD16 low ), the cluster 5 (brown) monocyte percentage increases for moderate and severe cases ( Figures 5 E and S4 C). Cluster 5 exhibits expression of inflammation-related transcripts such as S100A4 , S100A9 , S100A12 , and decreased HLA-DR surface protein level ( Figures 5 A–5D, S4 A, and S4B). Interestingly, monocytes in patients who improved (defined as a decrease of WOS from T1 to T2) displayed higher levels of HLA-DRB5 , S100A8 , etc. ( Figure S4 D; Table S4.1 ). The increase of S100 high HLA-DR low cluster 5 subset with downregulated HLA class II is reminiscent of monocyte “immunoparalysis” in sepsis ( Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020 24. Giamarellos-Bourboulis, E.J. ∙ Netea, M.G. ∙ Rovina, N. ... Complex Immune Dysregulation in COVID-19 Patients with Severe Respiratory Failure Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :992-1000 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1205) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is further supported by the decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) transcripts ( Figure S4 E). Expression of HLA class II genes in monocytes were negatively correlated with IL-6 plasma level ( Figure S4 F), suggesting an influence of the hyper-inflammatory plasma environment on monocyte dysfunction, prompting us to more deeply explore this connection.
We hypothesized that monocyte responses to COVID-19 may correlate with the metabolic and proteomic plasma compositions that vary with WOS ( Figure 1 E). We first identified plasma proteins that correlated with cluster 5 monocyte percentages. Pathway analysis of the top50 proteins ( Figure 5 G; Table S4.2 ) suggests an association with cytokine signaling, inflammation response, monocyte chemotaxis, IFN-γ, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling ( Figure 5 G; Table S4.4 ). These plasma protein signatures, most of which are reflected in the cross-omic interaction network of Figure 1 E, can be compared against monocyte gene expression signatures that increased with severity ( Figure 5 F). These include leukocyte chemotaxis, IFN-γ, and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling ( Figure 5 F). Metabolites that correlate with cluster 5 percentage are mainly within lipid and amino acid metabolisms ( Figure 5 H right panel), reminiscent of the many WOS-dependent cross-omic interaction connecting lipid and amino acid metabolites ( Figure 1 E). The top five positively correlated metabolites are N1-methyladenosine, two lipids, mannose, and kynurenine ( Figure 5 H; Table S4.3 ), of which kynurenine has been previously associated with COVID-19 severity ( Shen et al., 2020 72. Shen, B. ∙ Yi, X. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Proteomic and Metabolomic Characterization of COVID-19 Patient Sera Cell. 2020; 182 :59-72 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ). The associations between the cluster 5 subpopulation and the plasma analytes suggests that cluster 5 monocytes may play a potential role in the coordinated immune response for severe COVID-19 infections, and highly correlated plasma proteins, such as IL-6 and CCL23, could serve as potential biomarkers for rapidly assessing the dysfunctional state of monocytes in clinic.
We also characterized the polyfunctional strength index (PSI) of monocytes from COVID-19 patients. Unlike the case of CD8 + and CD4 + T cells ( Figures 2 K and 3 H), the PSI monotonically increases with disease severity ( Figure 5 I), suggesting that monocytes contribute to the pro-inflammatory condition of moderate or severe COVID-19. One can speculate that the increased S100 high HLA-DR low monocyte percentage may be influenced by and contribute to the inflammatory proteomic and altered metabolomic plasma profile.
Unsupervised clustering and UMAP visualization of NK cell transcriptomes resolved two well-known NK cell subsets: CD56 bright (cluster 4) and CD56 dim CD16 bright (clusters 0–3 and 5) ( Figures 6 A–6C) ( Miller and Lanier, 2019 61. Miller, J.S. ∙ Lanier, L.L. Natural Killer Cells in Cancer Immunotherapy Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2019; 3 :77-103 Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar ). The CD16 bright subpopulations display high levels of cytotoxic transcripts ( PRF1 and GZMB ) and elevated levels of the terminal-differentiation marker CD57 and the exhaustion marker LAG3 . The CD56 bright subpopulation (cluster 4) expresses markers associated with less-differentiation, including IL7R , CD27 , and CD62L ( Figures 6 A–6C, S5 A, and S5B). Cluster 4 is significantly repressed in moderate and severe patients ( Figures 6 D and S5 C), which may reflect the differentiation of NK cells toward more cytotoxic phenotypes and, again, points to the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease. This is consistent with the observed decrease of CD56 and CD127, and IL7R as well as the increase of PRF1 , GZMB , and CD69 in moderate and severe patients ( Figure S5 E). The NK cell activation in COVID-19 PBMCs has been seen using flow cytometry ( Maucourant et al., 2020 58. Maucourant, C. ∙ Filipovic, I. ∙ Ponzetta, A. ... Natural killer cell immunotypes related to COVID-19 disease severity Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 :eabd6832 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, among CD56 dim CD16 bright NK cells, one subpopulation (cluster 5) shows intermediate levels of CD16, CD57, and LAG3 , and the highest level of the proliferation marker MKI67 ( Figures 6 A–6C, S5 A, and S5B). The cluster 5 fraction increases from mild to moderate samples ( Figures 6 D and S5 C). We further investigated cluster 5 by visualizing a few functional signature scores for each NK cell across different clusters ( Figure S5 F). As expected, CD56 high cluster 4 cells reside mainly at the top-left region indicating a low level of exhaustion, while terminally differentiated cells with a high level of KIR transcripts are at the bottom-right branch ( Figure S5 F). Interestingly, the hybrid proliferative cluster 5 NK cells are at the intersection of these branches ( Figure S5 F), indicating that these cells may represent an intermediate transitional state during NK cell activation in response to virus. These cells also display upregulated signatures associated with fatty acid transport ( Figure S5 G; Table S5.1 ), potentially required to fulfill the proliferative capacity of this unique cluster.
We examined how NK cell transcriptomic signatures varied with disease trajectory and found an association between expression of the cytotoxic NK cell marker PRF1 and DNA repair marker DDIT4 and patient improvement (decrease of WOS between T1 and T2). For patients who did not improve, the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-inhibiting protein, COMMD6 , increased ( Figure S5 D; Table S5.2 ). Thus, increased levels of cytotoxicity, DNA replication, and decreased inhibition of NF κ B signaling in NK cells are associated with COVID-19 patient recovery.
The successful control of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires immune system coordination. We explored for such coordination by analyzing how the transcriptomes of all cell types covary across patients with different levels of disease severity. The goal is to provide a unified view of the immune response in COVID-19 patients that can potentially provide important insights for patient treatment. For this purpose, we utilized surprisal analysis ( Remacle et al., 2010 69. Remacle, F. ∙ Kravchenko-Balasha, N. ∙ Levitzki, A. ... Information-theoretic analysis of phenotype changes in early stages of carcinogenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :10324-10329 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), which has been applied to consolidate high-dimensional bulk and single-cell multi-omic data ( Su et al., 2019b 80. Su, Y. ∙ Lu, X. ∙ Li, G. ... Kinetic Inference Resolves Epigenetic Mechanism of Drug Resistance in Melanoma bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar , 2019a 79. Su, Y. ∙ Bintz, M. ∙ Yang, Y. ... Phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution of melanoma cells associated with targeted therapy resistance PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15 :e1007034 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020 81. Su, Y. ∙ Ko, M.E. ∙ Cheng, H. ... Multi-omic single-cell snapshots reveal multiple independent trajectories to drug tolerance in a melanoma cell line Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2345 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). The basic hypothesis is that many genes co-vary across samples and thus can be viewed as functional gene modules. In this way, changes of thousands of correlated transcripts from different cell types are condensed into just one major gene module. In this view, each sample is reduced into a single dot along that gene module axis ( Figure 7 A). The module may then be mined to identify biological processes that co-vary across different cell types or correlate with clinical features and changes in plasma composition.
The calculated most dominant module, module1 (M1), positively correlated (r = 0.95, p < 0.001, Figure S6 A) with sequencing-depth-related information, reflecting technical details rather than biological information. The second most dominant gene module (M2), did not correlate with these technical parameters ( Figure S6 B), but correlated with many genes with biological functions ( Figures 7 C and S6 B; Tables S6.1–S6.35 ), and so we selected M2 for further analysis.
Although M2 was computed without considering clinical information, it clearly separates healthy and mild from moderate and severe patients ( Figure 7 B). This recalls the distinct shift from mild to moderate cases revealed in many analyses discussed above. Potentially because of this separation, the M2 score also correlates with disease severity ( Figure S7 A, Spearman correlation = 0.62, p < 0.001), as well as with several clinical observations including CRP, blood clotting metrics (APTT, INR, and prothrombin time), and negative correlations with eosinophils and platelets ( Figures 7 D and S6 C).
We examined how properties of circulating immune cells tracked with increasing M2. Interestingly, the unusual phenotypes identified for each immune cell class (such as the hybrid CD8 + T cells or the cytotoxic CD4 + T cells, etc.) all exhibited significant positive correlations with M2 ( Figures S6 F and S7 C; Table S6.38 ). This suggests a level of orchestration across these unique COVID-19 specific subpopulations that is not apparent by analyzing those phenotypes in isolation. Naive cell types were consistently anti-correlated with M2 ( Figure S7 C). In other words, for motion along the M2 axis, the adaptive immune cells become increasingly activated and differentiated, and various unique immune cell phenotypes emerge ( Figure 7 F).
Innate immune cells also orchestrated transcriptional alterations along the M2 axis. This includes an increasing IFN-α response for all cell classes, suggesting a role of type I IFN response to infection ( Hadjadj et al., 2020 26. Hadjadj, J. ∙ Yatim, N. ∙ Barnabei, L. ... Impaired type I interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients Science. 2020; 369 :718-724 Crossref Scopus (1446) PubMed Google Scholar ). Different from the increased antigen presentation in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, monocytes showed decreased antigen presentation along M2 ( Figure 7 C). The unique S100 high HLA-DR low monocyte and the proliferative NK cell cluster also both correlate with M2 and emerge at the transition from mild to moderate disease ( Figure 7 C).
The M2 score also significantly correlated with the plasma proteomic principal component (PC) 2 and metabolomics PC1, both of which distinguish moderate and severe from mild disease ( Figures S1 D, S1E, S6 D, and S7 C). Many pro-inflammatory and chemo-attractive cytokines, including CCL7 and CXCL10, positively correlate with M2 while CLEC4A, a regulatory receptor for dendritic cells that impairs inflammation and T cell immunity ( Uto et al., 2016 88. Uto, T. ∙ Fukaya, T. ∙ Takagi, H. ... Clec4A4 is a regulatory receptor for dendritic cells that impairs inflammation and T-cell immunity Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11273 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), is negatively correlated ( Figures 7 E and S6 E; Table S6.36 ). Metabolites that positively correlate with M2 include the endothelial relaxing factor kynurenine ( Wang et al., 2010 94. Wang, Y. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ McKenzie, G. ... Kynurenine is an endothelium-derived relaxing factor produced during inflammation Nat. Med. 2010; 16 :279-285 Crossref Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ) that may be associated with hypotension seen in severe COVID-19 cases ( Hanidziar and Bittner, 2020 27. Hanidziar, D. ∙ Bittner, E.A. Hypotension, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, and COVID-19: A Clinical Conundrum Anesth. Analg. 2020; 131 :e175-e176 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). A number of lipids negatively correlate with M2 ( Figures 7 E and S6 E; Table S6.37 ), recalling the disproportionate loss of lipids in moderate and severe infections ( Figure 1 D, right panel). These results indicate that immune cell coordination, reflected in M2, is correlated with pro-inflammatory signals, loss of circulating lipids, and other biological processes associated with COVID-19.
In summary, we integrated the immune response, defined as whole transcriptomic changes, from all major cell types (with more than 120,000 variables) and condensed all of them into a single gene module ( Figure 7 A). This module M2 provides a detailed view for how different immune cell types coordinate across a highly heterogeneous cohort of COVID-19 patients ( Figures 7 F and S7 D), and again suggests major physiological changes that distinguish mild from moderate and severe COVID-19 infections.

Section: Discussion

A comprehensive understanding of immune responses in COVID-19 patients is fundamental to defining the effectiveness of treatments, predicting disease prognosis, and for understanding the reported heterogeneity of disease severities. We utilized computational methods to integrate clinical observations, single-cell characterizations, and plasma analytics, to develop a comprehensive and integrated view of COVID-19 during the week following initial diagnosis.
For a large cohort of patients representing the full spectrum of disease severities, we constructed a cross-omic interaction network ( Figure 1 E) that revealed, for example, COVID-19 severity-dependent connections between specific elevated cytokines and the downregulation of certain classes of metabolites and metabolic processes, suggesting an orchestration between increasing disease severity, elevated inflammation, and loss of key circulating nutrients. Further, the plasma multi-omic profiles captured a surprising similarity between moderate and severe COVID-19 and a sharp difference between mild and moderate infections. This major shift is marked by the preferential loss of lipids, amino acids, and xenobiotic metabolism ( Figure 1 D) and significant elevation of inflammatory cytokines ( Figure 1 C). The net implication is that of a stressed pro-inflammatory environment accompanied by decreased metabolic resources and signatures of possible hepatic dysfunction ( Alqahtani and Schattenberg, 2020 6. Alqahtani, S.A. ∙ Schattenberg, J.M. Liver injury in COVID-19: The current evidence United European Gastroenterol. J. 2020; 8 :509-519 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Similarly, a sharp difference between mild and moderate cases is observed in peripheral immune cells. This is characterized by the significant elevation of activated adaptive immune cells, and the emergence of unusual phenotypes. An interesting example is that of CD4 + T cells, which exhibit both a proliferative exhausted phenotype and a clonally expanded CD4 + cytotoxic phenotype. In fact, these two CD4 + phenotypes exhibit distinct functional signatures, distinct TCR sharing patterns, and may represent two divergent destinations for naive CD4 + T cells. Whether these phenotypes are harmful or protective remains unclear, but their relative abundances increase with infection severity, starting at the transition between mild and moderate disease.
Similar to a previous report ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 71. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ... Severe COVID-19 Is Marked by a Dysregulated Myeloid Cell Compartment Cell. 2020; 182 :1419-1440 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (634) PubMed Google Scholar ), we find a relative decrease in non-classical monocytes and the emergence of S100 high HLA-DR low monocytes at the stage of moderate disease. We also find that this subset highly correlated with global changes within the plasma proteome and metabolome. In general, unusual or dysfunctional adaptive or innate immune cell phenotypes that are unique to severe cases are not seen. Rather such phenotypes are seen in moderately ill patients and are only relatively increased in severe patients, further emphasizing the similarity between severe and moderate disease and the sharp difference between mild and moderate cases.
Gene module M2 ( Figure 7 ) further reflects the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease and yields a coordinated view of the immune response to infection. M2, which was calculated using the immune cell transcriptomic data, readily distinguishes healthy donors and mild patients from moderate and severe cases, positively correlates with all observed unique immune cell phenotypes, with pro-inflammatory signals in the plasma, with the loss of specific metabolite classes, and with multiple clinical metrics (e.g., CRP). These correlative findings suggest that routine clinical measures may provide surrogate biomarkers for the immune dysfunction that emerges post the stage of mild disease and may yield markers that can anticipate disease course or provide surrogate endpoints for COVID-19 trials. The recognition of a non-monotonic change occurring between mild and moderate COVID-19 is potentially of high value, because therapeutic interventions at the stage of moderate disease are likely to be most effective. The resources provided from this work could prove valuable in developing such interventions, such as anti-inflammatory therapies that preserve the IFN-α antiviral response, and target coagulation defects or metabolic resource starvation. This broad systems immunology approach should also be applicable toward understanding immune responses in a plethora of other infectious diseases.

A large percentage of patients presented with chronic hypertension (42%), and among other comorbidities, obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ; 37%; BMI ranged from 13.9 to 56.0 with Mean = 29.7, SD = 7.8), type 2 diabetes mellitus (19%), coronary artery disease (5%), and pulmonary disease (i.e., asthma or COPD; 24 or 19%) were the most prevalent. Patients in this study received a number of medications, including tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor inhibitor), remdesivir (an antiviral), hydroxychloroquine, and antibiotics. 38% of draws were collected from the patient’s home (mobile phlebotomy), 38% of draws were collected from non-ICU hospitalized patients, 21% of draws were from patients in the ICU, and 3% from the clinic. All participants in this study provided written informed consent, in accordance with 45 CFR 46. De-identified proteomic and metabolomic data from matched healthy controls were previously collected from individuals enrolled in a wellness program at baseline (Arivale, Seattle, WA) ( Manor et al., 2018 56. Manor, O. ∙ Zubair, N. ∙ Conomos, M.P. ... A Multi-omic Association Study of Trimethylamine N-Oxide Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :935-946 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ), and processed using the same proteomic and metabolomic protocol. Healthy control samples for single-cell analyses were obtained from Bloodworks Northwest (Seattle, WA). All healthy control participants provided informed consent and authorization and permission for their de-identified data to be used for scientific research. Control samples for proteomics and metabolomics were matched on age and sex with enrolled patients. Information on age, sex, medication, and co-morbidities is listed in Table S1 . This study was designed to characterize the immunological responses in COVID-19 patients without the intention of the development of new treatments or new diagnostics, and therefore sample size estimation was not included in the original study design. Procedures for the current study were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Providence St. Joseph Health with IRB Study Number [STUDY2020000175] and the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB) with IRB Study Number 20170658.
WOS for time of blood draw were determined by manual expert review. WOS for Figure S1 A were automatically generated from data extracted from the electronic health record for hospitalized patients, and plotted for 6-hour time intervals based on end-interval grade. Automated results were compared against manual expert review for 15% of study subjects.
The following data were collected from the subject’s electronic health record (EHR): complete blood count (CBC) with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, APTT, D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, thrombin time,and troponin I. Lab data were extracted from the nearest time point to each blood draw, if available within a window ± two days. First blood draw (n = 76), second blood draw (n = 54). Blood draws were classified as WOS = 3-4 (n = 83) and WOS = 5-7 (n = 47). We used an unpaired Wilcoxon-test to determine the statistical difference between WOS = 3-4 and WOS = 5-7, and P values were FDR adjusted. Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated using R package ‘corrplot v0.84’ to observe the associations between EHR labs and WOS disease severity, and the correlation significance was reported as FDR adjusted P values.
Plasma and PBMC isolation were conducted with standard protocols from Bloodworks Northwest (Seattle, WA). Patient blood was collected in BD Vacutainer (EDTA) tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Plasma fractions were collected after centrifuged at 800 x g at 4°C for 10 min, aliquoted, and stored until use at −80°C. The rest of the blood was diluted with PBS (pH7.2) to 2X of the original volume and layered over 15 mL Ficoll (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) in SepMate-50 tubes (StemCell, Vancouver, BC). After centrifuged at 800 x g for 15 min at room temperature, the PBMC layer (did not include granulocytes (such as neutrophils)) was poured into a 50 mL conical tube. The cells were washed twice with autoMACS Rinsing Solution (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and centrifuge at 250 x g for 10 min, at RT. PBMC pellets were gently resuspended in 5 mL Rinsing Solution and a 5 μL aliquot was diluted 1:10 v/v for cell counting. Cells in 18 μL of diluted samples were first mixed with 2 μL of Acridine Orange / Propidium Iodide Stain (Logos Biosystems, Annandale, VA), 10 μL was then loaded to a PhotonSlide (Logos Biosystems) and counted in a LUNA FL Dual Fluorescence cell counter (Logos Biosystems). Cryopreservation freeze media CryoStor CS-10 (Biolife Solutions, Bothell, WA) was slowly added to make a concentration of 2.5 million PBMC/ml. Cells were aliquoted in 2.0 mL Cryotube vials (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and frozen in CoolCell LX Cell Freezing Container (Corning, Corning, NY) at −80°C for at least 2 hours before stored in liquid nitrogen until use.
Plasma concentrations of proteins were measured using the ProSeek Cardiovascular II, Inflammation, Metabolism, Immune Response, and Organ Damage panels (Olink Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Health control plasma samples were processed at Olink facilities in Boston, MA. Plasma samples from COVID-19 participants were assayed at the Institute for Systems Biology. Proteins from patient plasma were measured using proximity extension assay (PEA) (Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden) which allows for the simultaneous analysis of 92 protein biomarkers on each panel. Five panels including Inflammation, Cardiovascular II, Organ Damage, Immune Response, and Metabolism were run using 328 patient plasma samples as well as 8 replicates of a pooled healthy control. One microliter of plasma was incubated overnight and allowed to bind with oligonucleotide-labeled antibody pairs to form specific DNA duplexes. This template was then extended and pre-amplified, and the individual protein markers were measured using high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA). The resulting Ct values were normalized against an extension control, an inter-plate control, and adjusted with a correction factor according to the manufacturer’s instructions to calculate a normalized protein expression value (NPX) in log2 scale. Samples were processed in batches with pooled quality control samples included in each batch. Specifically, 8 technical replicates from a pooled blood sample served as overlapping reference samples in each plate. Raw expression values are then batch corrected by normalizing to the overlapping reference samples within each plate.
Metabolon (Morrisville, NC, USA) conducted the metabolomics assays for all participant plasma samples used in this study. Data were generated with the Global Metabolomics platform via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem accurate mass spectrometry. 100 μl of plasma was aliquoted and transported on dry ice to Metabolon Inc. for analysis. Sample handling and quality control were performed by Metabolon in their CLIA-certified laboratory. Mass spectrometry was performed using Metabolon’s ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) Global Platform, which consisting of four independent UPLC–MS/MS instruments, each with a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer at 35,000 mass resolution. Data extraction, along with biochemical identification, data curation, quantification, and data normalizations were performed by Metabolon’s hardware and software. Samples were processed in batches with pooled quality control samples included in each batch; pooled quality control samples were consistent across batches. Potential batch effects for each metabolite were adjusted by dividing by the corresponding average value identified in the pooled quality control samples from the same batch. For analysis, the raw metabolomics data were median scaled within each batch such that the median value for each metabolite was one.
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and incubated in the RPMI 1640 for overnight recovery at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Recovered cell viability was measured at > 95% for all samples. After overnight recovery, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations and monocytes were magnetically isolated using the CD4 + , CD8 + Microbeads and Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) sequentially.
The enriched CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (100,000 cells/well in a 96 well-plate) were stimulated for 6 hours with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibodies (pre-coated at 10 μg/mL overnight at 4°C) and soluble anti-CD28 antibodies (5 μg/mL) in complete RPMI-1640 at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . The enriched monocytes at 1 × 10 5 /ml were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 12 hours.
After stimulation, the activated cells were collected, washed, and stained with membrane stain (included in the IsoPlexis kit). The stained cells were then loaded onto the chip consisting of the 12,000 chambers pre-coated with an array of 32 cytokine capture antibodies. The chip was inserted into the fully automated IsoLight for further incubation for 16 hours and the cytokines were detected by a cocktail of detection antibodies followed by the fluorescent labeling. The scanned fluorescent signal was analyzed by IsoSpeak software to calculate the numbers of cytokine-secreting cells, the intensity level of cytokines, and polyfunctional strength index (PSI).
See the below for the measured cytokines in each panel.
Single-Cell Adaptive Immune cytokine panel including the following subsets of cytokines. Effector: Granzyme B, IFN-γ, MIP-1α, Perforin, TNF-α, TNF-β; Stimulatory: GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-5, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21; Chemoattractive: CCL11, IP-10, MIP-1β, RANTES; Regulatory: IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IL-22, TGFβ1, sCD137, sCD40L; Inflammatory: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, MCP-1, MCP-4.
Single-Cell Innate Immune cytokine panel including the following subsets of cytokines. Effector: IFN-γ, MIP-1α, TNF-α, TNF-β; Stimulatory: GM-CSF, IL-8, IL-9, IL-15, IL-18, TGF-α, IL-5; Chemoattractive: CCL11, IP-10, MIP-1β, RANTES, BCA-1; Regulatory: IL-10, IL-13, IL-22, sCD40L; Inflammatory: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12-p40, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-17F, MCP-1, MCP-4, MIF; Growth Factors: EGF, PDGF-BB, VEGF.
For surface marker and intracellular cytokine staining, PBMCs were surface stained for 30 minutes at 4°C and washed twice. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 minutes and washed twice with 1x permeabilization solution. Intracellular cytokines were stained using an antibody cocktail and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. The washed cells were analyzed with Attune NxT and the data was analyzed with FlowJo software. Antibodies against human CD4, CD8, PD-1, Ki-67, and Granzyme B were purchased from Biolegend.
Chromium Single Cell Kits (10x Genomics) were utilized to analyze the transcriptomic, surface protein levels and, TCR sequences simultaneously from the same cell. Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and 1X red blood cell lysis solution (BioLegend) was used to lyse any remaining red blood cells in the PBMC samples. Cells were stained with a panel of TotalSeq-C human antibodies that includes hashtag multiplexing antibodies (BioLegend) detailed in Table S1.8 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Stained cells were then loaded onto a Chromium Next GEM chip G. Cells were lysed for reverse transcription and complementary DNA (cDNA) amplification in the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics). The polyadenylated transcripts were reverse-transcribed inside each gel bead-in-emulsion afterward. Full-length cDNA along with cell barcode identifiers were PCR-amplified and sequencing libraries were prepared and normalized. The constructed library was sequenced on the Novaseq platform (Illumina).
Severity of COVID-19 was clinical status assessed throughout a patient’s encounter in accordance to the 9-point the World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale (WOS) for clinical improvement consisting of the following categories: 0) uninfected - no evidence of infection; 1) ambulatory - no limitation of activities; 2) ambulatory - limitation of activities; 3) hospitalized, mild - no oxygen therapy; 4) hospitalized, mild - oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5) hospitalized, severe - non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen; 6) hospitalized, severe - intubation and mechanical ventilation; 7) hospitalized, severe - ventilation + additional organ support; and 8) dead – death ( World Health Organization, 2020 101. World Health Organization COVID-19 Therapeutic Trial Synopsis World Health Organization, 2020 Google Scholar ). For Figure S1 A, WOS was calculated in 6-hour intervals, and the score was used that corresponded to the window in which the blood was drawn.
We conducted Spearman correlation analysis to evaluate the association between gene module2 (M2), obtained from surprisal analysis of sc-RNA-seq data, and disease severity (WOS) with clinical labs as well as CBCs. The correlation significance was reported as FDR adjusted P values.
For quality control analysis, a threshold of less than 20% missing values was set for each protein and metabolite. Missing values for proteins were imputed to be the limits of detection while missing values for metabolites were imputed to the lowest measured value. A total of 463 proteins and 877 metabolites were included in further statistical analyses.
For association with COVID-19 status and severity, we assessed the differential abundance of protein and metabolite levels between healthy and COVID-19 samples. Specifically, we compared samples from uninfected participants with samples from mild (WHO Ordinal Scale 1-2), moderate (WHO Ordinal Scale (3-4), and severe (WHO Ordinal Scale 5-7) patients. For all analyses, only samples from the first blood draw were considered.
Prior to association analysis, levels of proteins and metabolites were first adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and race/ethnicity. We then performed Welch’s t tests between uninfected and mild; mild and moderate; and moderate and severe samples. Analyses were performed for proteins and metabolites separately. Multiple testing correction was subsequently applied to each comparison using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure with false discovery rate (FDR) at 5%. Age, sex, BMI, and race/ethnicity adjusted protein and metabolite levels were tested separately and multiple testing correction was performed using BH FDR < 5%.
Further metabolites that significantly changed (FDR < 0.05) in the aforementioned stepwise comparisons were first grouped by their superpathway (e.g., lipid, xenobiotic, etc.). Then the fold changes of each metabolite within a superpathway group was summed and utilized for the stacked bar plots shown in Figure 1 D, right panel. Similarly, proteins that significantly changed (FDR < 0.05) in the aforementioned stepwise comparisons were utilized for the plot shown in Figure 1 C, right panel.
For association with gene module2 score of single-cell data, pearson correlation was also performed to test the association of adjusted metabolite and protein levels with the M2 score derived from surprisal analysis of single-cell data. Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients and associated P values were subsequently used.
PCA was performed separately for metabolomic and proteomic data using metabolites and proteins that passed quality control, respectively. Values were centered and scaled from 0 to 1 prior to dimensional reduction. In the case of proteins, all proteins that could not be determined for any patient were removed from the dataset, and PCA was run on the remaining 352 proteins per patient using scikit-learn in python ( Pedregosa et al., 2011 66. Pedregosa, F. ∙ Varoquaux, G. ∙ Gramfort, A. ... Scikit-Learn: Machine Learning in Python J. Mach. Learn. Res. 2011; 12 :2825-2830 Google Scholar ). In the case of metabolites, several more values could not be determined and so deterministic PCA was not feasible. Instead, all metabolites that could not be determined for > 20% of patients were removed. This left 766 of 1053 metabolites remaining, and only 4.98% of the filtered dataset undetermined. Then, the dimensional reduction was applied to the filtered data via probabilistic PCA in MATLAB ( Tipping and Bishop, 1999 86. Tipping, M.E. ∙ Bishop, C.M. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. Stat. Methodol. 1999; 61 :611-622 Crossref Scopus (2307) Google Scholar ). PCA plots were colored by the severity of the patient based on the WOS at the time of the blood draw.
Metabolite data (N = 123 patients and k = 243 observations) and protein data (N = 127 patients and k = 249 observations) collected from plasma were combined with clinical test data extracted from patent medical records (N = 79 patients and k = 137 observations) as well as patient baseline demographics. Clinical test data collected within two days of blood draws were used for this analysis. Multiple observations were available for most patients. Proteins and metabolites with greater than 50% missingness were dropped from the dataset.
First, we identified a set of significant pairwise Spearman correlations between inter-omic analytes, adjusting for potential confounding variables. This initial step was performed to lower the computational burden for downstream model fitting. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were fit for each of N = 1,591 analytes using the model analyte ∼age_at_baseline + C(sex) + C(race) + C(ethnicity) + BMI . For skewed analytes ( | 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑤 | > 1 . 5 ), a Gamma distribution with a log link function was used; otherwise a Gaussian distribution with an identity link function was used. The Exchangeable dependence structure was used to account for the non-independence of multiple observations within each patient. Residuals from each GEE were used to compute Spearman correlations between each pair of inter-omic analytes (e.g., metabolite-protein, metabolite-clinical, or clinical-protein). P values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) 13. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Hochberg, Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol. 1995; 57 :289-300 Crossref Google Scholar .
Disease severity at each patient blood draw was calculated using the WHO ordinal scale. For each of 27,386 highly significant (FDR < 0.001) pairwise inter-omic Spearman correlations calculated in the previous step, we fit a GEE using the model analyte1 ∼age_at_baseline + C(sex) + C(race) + C(ethnicity) + BMI + who_ordinal_scale ∗ analyte2 on the original (non-residualized) data. For skewed analytes ( | 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑤 | > 1 . 5 ), a Gamma distribution with a log link function was used; otherwise a Gaussian distribution with an identity link function was used. The Exchangeable dependence structure was used to account for the non-independence of multiple observations within each patient. Interaction p values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses.
Droplet-based sequencing data were aligned and quantified using the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (version 3.0.0, 10x Genomics) against the GRCh38 human reference genome. Cells from each demultiplexed sample were first filtered for cells that expressed a minimum of 200 genes, then they were filtered based on three metrics: 1) the total number of unique molecular identifiers (UMI) counts per cell (library size) must be less than 10000; 2) the number of detected genes per cell must be less than 2500; and 3) the proportion of mitochondrial gene counts (UMIs from mitochondrial genes / total UMIs) must be less than 10%. Doublets were either simultaneously identified in sample demultiplexing or identified using scrublet ( Wolock et al., 2019 100. Wolock, S.L. ∙ Lopez, R. ∙ Klein, A.M. Scrublet: Computational Identification of Cell Doublets in Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :281-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar ) and were removed prior to the aforementioned filtering. After QC metric filtering, a total of 559,583 cells were retained for downstream analysis. Scanpy ( Wolf et al., 2018 99. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (1433) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to normalize cells via CPM normalization (UMI total count of each cell was set to 10 6 ) and log1p transformation (natural log of CPM plus one).
PCA was performed on the normalized, ln(CPM+1), gene expression matrix of all cells passing the previously mentioned QC metrics, “arpack” was set as the SVD solver. A neighborhood graph was built with n-neighbors set to 15 and all 50 calculated PCs as inputs. This neighborhood graph was utilized to calculate a UMAP ( McInnes et al., 2018 59. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1802.03426 https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426 Google Scholar ) and clusters were determined via the Leiden algorithm ( Traag et al., 2018 87. Traag, V. ∙ Waltman, L. ∙ van Eck, N.J. From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1810.08473 https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08473 Google Scholar ). Clusters identified in this first round of clustering were annotated based on the expression of canonical marker genes. Clusters that were not uniform in their expression of well-known marker genes were extracted and a second round of dimension reduction and clustering was performed on these subsets (recalculation of UMAP and Leiden, this was mainly utilized to separate T cells and NK cells, and rare cell type populations). Clusters that simultaneously expressed canonical markers from two or more major cell types were identified as potential doublets or low-quality cells and were removed from downstream analysis. 10,433 low-quality cells were removed resulting in 549,210 total cells for further analyses.
Identified T cells from the first and second round of clustering were extracted for CD4 + and CD8 + T cell identification. A CD4 + T cell score was obtained by taking the sum of the scaled values (scale the ln(CPM + 1) values to be from 0 to 1) of the CD4 transcript and CD4 surface protein. A CD8 + T cell score was obtained by taking the sum of the scaled values of the CD8A and CD8B transcripts, and the CD8 surface protein. Both scores were subsequently scaled to be from 0 to 1 and utilized as inputs for a scatterplot for manual gating of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells. Other T cells were then defined as T cells that did not confidently categorize as CD4 + or CD8 + .
All 50 computed PCs from the PCA performed on the normalized gene expression data were used as inputs to calculate a bbKNN graph ( Polański et al., 2020 67. Polański, K. ∙ Young, M.D. ∙ Miao, Z. ... BBKNN: fast batch alignment of single cell transcriptomes Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :964-965 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ) which was set to correct across batch-specific patient samples (this treats patient samples which were obtained from different sequencing batches/reactions as different). This bbKNN graph was then utilized to calculate batch corrected UMAP coordinates, which are projected in Figure S1 K (left panel). Batch correction (based on bbKNN) was only used for UMAP visualization purposes in Figure S1 K (left panel). No major batch effects were found as examined through heatmap visualization of batch-specific cell-types with cell-type markers in Figure S1 J and hierarchical clustering of batch-specific cell-types in Figure S1 K (right panel). Downstream statistical analysis was performed on the uncorrected data as recommended in ( Amezquita et al., 2020 7. Amezquita, R.A. ∙ Lun, A.T.L. ∙ Becht, E. ... Orchestrating single-cell analysis with Bioconductor Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :137-145 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Major immune cell types CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, monocytes, B cells, and NK cells were further analyzed via a construction of their single-cell regulatory networks by inputting their normalized gene expression matrices into pySCENIC ( Van de Sande et al., 2020 90. Van de Sande, B. ∙ Flerin, C. ∙ Davie, K. ... A scalable SCENIC workflow for single-cell gene regulatory network analysis Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15 :2247-2276 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Patient 4 B cells were removed from the B cell transcriptomic dataset inputted into pySCENIC as they had chronic lymphocytic leukemia and a resultant cancerous population of B cells. Due to the large number of identified monocytes (n = 175,635), it was not computationally feasible to perform single-cell regulatory network calculation on the entire monocyte dataset and thus monocytes were subsetted by taking one-third of the monocytes from each sample resulting in 58,542 monocytes being utilized to calculate transcription factor modules. The resultant single-cell transcription factor modules from each cell type were subject to PCA. Batch-specific PC dimensions, determined via plotting of sequencing batches and canonical subpopulation markers onto reduced dimensional space (PC or UMAP), were removed. This entailed the removal of PC7 from CD8 + T cells, PC9 from CD4 + T cells, and PC4 from NK cells. Further dimensional reduction was calculated via a neighborhood graph (n-neighbors was set to 15 and all PCs (49 if a PC was removed, 50 if no PCs were removed) were utilized) and subsequently a UMAP with the neighborhood graph as input. Clustering was calculated via the Leiden algorithm with resolution set to 0.8 for CD8 + T cells, 1.0 for CD4 + T cells, 0.95 for B cells, 0.95 for monocytes, and 0.7 for NK cells. All reduced dimensions (PCA, neighborhood graph, UMAP) and clusters (Leiden) for all of the aforementioned single cell RNA-seq data were calculated via Scanpy ( Wolf et al., 2018 99. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (1433) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Signatures scores were calculated for CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, and NK cells for further characterization of cell type specific subpopulations. For all of the aforementioned cell types for which signature scores were computed, the single cell transcriptomic matrix was first subject to MAGIC imputation ( van Dijk et al., 2018 91. van Dijk, D. ∙ Sharma, R. ∙ Nainys, J. ... Recovering Gene Interactions from Single-Cell Data Using Data Diffusion Cell. 2018; 174 :716-729 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ). Imputed gene expression values were then utilized to calculate the signature scores, unless otherwise specified the signature scores consist of the sum of the scaled values (genes were scaled to be from 0 to 1) of a gene set. For CD8 + T cells naive ( TCF7 , LEF1 , SELL , CCR7 ), cytotoxic ( NKG7 , CCL4 , CST7 , PRF1 , GZMA , GZMB , IFNG , CCL3 ), exhaustion ( PDCD1 , TIGIT , LAG3 , HAVCR2 , CTLA4 ), and proliferation ( MKI67 , TYMS ) signature scores were calculated. For CD4 + T cells naive ( TCF7 , LEF1 , SELL , CCR7 ), cytotoxic ( GZMB , PRF1 , GNLY ), exhaustion ( PDCD1 , TIGIT , LAG3 , HAVCR2 , CTLA4 ), and proliferation ( MKI67 , TYMS ) signature scores were calculated. The CD4 + T cell Th1 signature score was calculated via the average of a HLA class II signature score ( HLA-DRA , HLA-DRB1 , HLA-DRB5 , HLA-DQA1 , HLA-DQA2 , HLA-DQB1 , HLA-DMA , HLA-DMB , HLA-DPA1 , HLA-DPB1 ) and the imputed expression of the IFNG transcript. Genes utilized in the HLA class II signature score were selected via filtering for transcripts with non-sparse expression as determined via plotting all HLA class II transcripts onto the single cell transcription factor module determined UMAP for CD4 + T cells. For NK cells undifferentiated ( SELL , NCAM1 ), exhaustion ( PDCD1 , TIGIT , LAG3 , HAVCR2 , CTLA4 ), cytotoxic ( NKG7 , CCL4 , CST7 , PRF1 , GZMA , GZMB , IFNG , CCL3 ), proliferation ( MKI67 , TYMS ), and KIR ( KIR2DL1 , KIR2DL3 , KIR3DL1 , KIR3DL2 ) signature scores were calculated.
To quantify the pathway enrichment score across samples or cells, GSVA was performed using the R package GSVA (v.3.11) ( Hänzelmann et al., 2013 28. Hänzelmann, S. ∙ Castelo, R. ∙ Guinney, J. GSVA: gene set variation analysis for microarray and RNA-seq data BMC Bioinformatics. 2013; 14 :7 Crossref Scopus (3929) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify the most changed pathways between samples/cells with the averaged log 2 (CPM+1) data as input.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 82. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: A knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (26146) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed using GSEA v4.1.0 software with “weighted” enrichment statistics. Transcriptomic pseudo-bulk of Leiden clusters (per cell type) and transcriptomic pseudo-bulk of samples (patient blood draws and healthy donor samples, also per cell type) were subject to this analysis. Pseudo-bulk of Leiden clusters were calculated by taking the mean normalized (ln(CPM + 1)) gene expression values of each Leiden cluster, and pseudo-bulk of samples were similarly calculated by taking the mean normalized (ln(CPM + 1)) gene expression values of each sample. Each pseudo-bulk was then separately (only one pseudo-bulk was used at a time) used as the input with “diff_of_classes” methods used as the metric for ranking genes. Normalized enrichment score (NES) was assessed across the curated Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) Hallmark, C2 curated gene sets, C5 Gene ontology, and C7 Immunological signature.

For monocytes, the selection of transcripts for Figure 5 D are based on the combined list of the top5 most differentially expressed genes (determined via the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test) for each monocyte cluster, only one copy of duplicate genes were kept in the final gene list and genes were hierarchically clustered via the “complete” linkage method (also known as the Farthest Point algorithm).

Full lists of the top genes, proteins, and pathways and their associated statistics are provided in Table S4 and the gene ontology analysis of the top300 genes are also provided in the Table S4 . P values for all correlations plotted are all less than 0.05.
The gene module score was calculated based on surprisal analysis, an information-theoretical analysis technique that integrates and applies principles of thermodynamics and maximal entropy ( Agmon et al., 1979 4. Agmon, N. ∙ Alhassid, Y. ∙ Levine, R.D. An algorithm for finding the distribution of maximal entropy J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 30 :250-258 Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar ; Levine, 2005 44. Levine, R.D. Molecular Reaction Dynamics Cambridge University Press, 2005 Crossref Scopus (758) Google Scholar ). It has already been well-used in a spectrum of disciplines including engineering, physics, chemistry, and biomedical engineering ( Levine, 1978 43. Levine, R.D. Information Theory Approach to Molecular Reaction Dynamics Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1978; 29 :59-92 Crossref Google Scholar , 2005 44. Levine, R.D. Molecular Reaction Dynamics Cambridge University Press, 2005 Crossref Scopus (758) Google Scholar ; Levine and Bernstein, 1974 45. Levine, R.D. ∙ Bernstein, R.B. Energy disposal and energy consumption in elementary chemical reactions. Information theoretic approach Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7 :393-400 Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar ). Recently, it has been extended to characterize the state of living cells, specifically monitoring and characterizing biological processes using transcriptional data ( Remacle et al., 2010 69. Remacle, F. ∙ Kravchenko-Balasha, N. ∙ Levitzki, A. ... Information-theoretic analysis of phenotype changes in early stages of carcinogenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :10324-10329 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zadran et al., 2014 103. Zadran, S. ∙ Arumugam, R. ∙ Herschman, H. ... Surprisal analysis characterizes the free energy time course of cancer cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :13235-13240 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ).
When applying surprisal analysis to our particular scenario, we have a dataset characterized by a cohort of patient samples with different immune profiles (defined by gene expression from all five cell types), Equation 1 from surprisal analysis can de-convolute the changes of thousands of genes into one unchanged gene expression baseline, l n X 0 𝑛 ⁢ ( 𝑘 ) , and a series of gene expression modules, 𝜆 𝑗 ⁡ ( 𝑘 ) ⋅ 𝐺 𝑛 𝑗 . Each module contains a group of genes that are coordinately changing together across patient samples. In the equation, 𝐺 𝑛 𝑗 value represent the contribution of each gene from each cell type (with n going from 1 to (#cell types) x (#genes)), onto module j, and 𝜆 𝑗 ⁡ ( 𝑘 ) values represent the overall score of this gene module j across patient sample k .
The mathematical derivation and computational implementation details have been well documented in the previous publication ( Remacle et al., 2010 69. Remacle, F. ∙ Kravchenko-Balasha, N. ∙ Levitzki, A. ... Information-theoretic analysis of phenotype changes in early stages of carcinogenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :10324-10329 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we are fitting the sum of terms, ∑ 𝑗 𝜆 𝑗 ⁡ ( 𝑘 ) ⋅ 𝐺 𝑛 𝑗 as shown on the right-hand side of Equation 1 to the logarithm of the measured expression level of cell-type transcript n (with n going from 1 to (#cell types) x (#genes)) at the given patient sample k . This is repeated for every sample in the pseudo-bulk which contains (#cell types) x (#genes) rows and (#patient samples) columns of the normalized (ln(CPM+1)) gene expression values. A suitable general method has been published ( Agmon et al., 1979 4. Agmon, N. ∙ Alhassid, Y. ∙ Levine, R.D. An algorithm for finding the distribution of maximal entropy J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 30 :250-258 Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar ) and extensively applied mRNA microarrays monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes at a time. As the analysis of the data needs to be handled by numerical procedures that are compatible with such a large dataset, we have adapted singular value decomposition to handle the optimization problem as detailed in ( Remacle et al., 2010 69. Remacle, F. ∙ Kravchenko-Balasha, N. ∙ Levitzki, A. ... Information-theoretic analysis of phenotype changes in early stages of carcinogenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :10324-10329 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). l n X 𝑛 ⁢ ( 𝑘 ) = l n X 0 𝑛 ⁢ ( 𝑘 ) − ∑ 𝑗 𝜆 𝑗 ⁡ ( 𝑘 ) ⋅ 𝐺 𝑛 𝑗 Equation 1 In this study, the most dominant constraint, λ1 was reflecting sequencing technical variations ( Figure S6 A), thus the 2 nd most dominant constraint, λ2 , which is associated with many biological processes ( Figure 7 C) was further investigated as the immune response module M2, scores for analyzed blood draw samples are in Table S6.39 .
The dataset collected here can be analyzed, at a high level, in two different ways. First, each blood draw corresponds to a time point at which that patient was characterized by a level of disease severity (WOS) ( Table S1.1 ). Grouping each blood draw according to WOS, a contemporary measure of disease severity, can provide insight into how various immune cell populations, regulatory networks, and other biomarkers vary with disease severity level by sample. A second view is to consider each patient separately, so that the two blood draws are used to capture an individual patient’s disease trajectory. Here, patients that improve between T1 and T2 can be differentiated from patients advancing to more severe infection. We utilize both types of analyses here. Disease trajectories the time of the T1 and T2 blood draws, and WOS measures of disease severity, are provided in Figure S1 A. These trajectories start at the self-reported day of symptom onset and give WOS during the time of hospital admission.
Differential expression analysis was performed using the R package MAST ( Finak et al., 2015 22. Finak, G. ∙ McDavid, A. ∙ Yajima, M. ... MAST: a flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing data Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :278 Crossref Scopus (940) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each cell type (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, monocytes, B cells, and NK cells), we investigated the WHO-score delta by comparing patients getting better (having a WHO score that decreases (T2-T1)) to patients staying stable (having a WHO score that does not decrease/increase (T2-T1)). The normalized (but not batch corrected) gene-cell barcode was used as input, and we adjusted for all factors in our model as recommended in Amezquita et al. (2020) 7. Amezquita, R.A. ∙ Lun, A.T.L. ∙ Becht, E. ... Orchestrating single-cell analysis with Bioconductor Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :137-145 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar . Our MAST models included as covariates the batch and patient ID, as well as the cellular detection rate (CDR) to correct for biological and technical nuisance factors. Multiple hypothesis testing correction was performed by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Genes were declared significantly differentially expressed at a FDR of 5% and a fold-change > 1.5.
Droplet-based sequencing data for T cell receptor sequences were aligned and quantified using the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (version 3.1.0, 10x Genomics) against the GRCh38 human VDJ reference genome.
Filtered annotated contigs for T cell receptor sequences were analyzed via scirpy ( Sturm et al., 2020 78. Sturm, G. ∙ Szabo, T. ∙ Fotakis, G. ... Scirpy: A Scanpy extension for analyzing single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing data bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The aforementioned contig files were read in as TCRs, filtered for either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells (as identified via single cell RNA-seq analysis) and then subject to clonotype definition and clonal expansion analysis utilizing nucleotide sequences. Samples were then concatenated together and merged with gene expression data for simultaneous single cell TCR and RNA data visualization.
Both the integrated CD4 + and CD8 + T cell datasets were subject to filtering for cells with complete TCR sequences, defined as a detectable TRA and TRB. This filtering resulted in 107,397 of the 169,019 CD4 + T cells, and 55,994 of the 91,810 CD8 + T cells for downstream TCR analysis. Each integrated T cell subset was grouped by Leiden clusters resulting in a TCR matrix consisting of Leiden clusters as rows and unique TCRs as columns with the number of cells with a given TCR in a certain Leiden cluster as values. The TCR matrix was then filtered for shared TCRs (TCR sequence is present in at least two clusters) and then transformed via log1p transformation (formula = ln(value + 1)) and values were clipped at 2 (any value greater than 2 was set to 2). Both TCRs and Leiden clusters were subject to hierarchal clustering (scanpy.tl.dendrogram) with the method set to “ward.” TCR clusters were determined utilizing the fcluster function from scipy ( Virtanen et al., 2020 92. Virtanen, P. ∙ Gommers, R. ∙ Oliphant, T.E. ..., SciPy 1.0 Contributors SciPy 1.0: fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :261-272 Crossref Scopus (8834) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the criterion set to “distance” and the distance set to 800 for CD8 + T cells and 175 for CD4 + T cells.
All data has been integrated for further visualization and analysis in ISB COVID-19 data explorer at https://atlas.fredhutch.org/isb/covid/ .
