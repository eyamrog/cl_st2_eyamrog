Title: Ca 2+ sensor-mediated ROS scavenging suppresses rice immunity and is exploited by a fungal effector


Abstract: Summary

Plant immunity is activated upon pathogen perception and often affects growth and yield when it is constitutively active. How plants fine-tune immune homeostasis in their natural habitats remains elusive. Here, we discover a conserved immune suppression network in cereals that orchestrates immune homeostasis, centering on a Ca 2+ -sensor, RESISTANCE OF RICE TO DISEASES1 (ROD1). ROD1 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by stimulating catalase activity, and its protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination. ROD1 disruption confers resistance to multiple pathogens, whereas a natural ROD1 allele prevalent in indica rice with agroecology-specific distribution enhances resistance without yield penalty. The fungal effector AvrPiz-t structurally mimics ROD1 and activates the same ROS-scavenging cascade to suppress host immunity and promote virulence. We thus reveal a molecular framework adopted by both host and pathogen that integrates Ca 2+ sensing and ROS homeostasis to suppress plant immunity, suggesting a principle for breeding disease-resistant, high-yield crops.

Section: Introduction

In the absence of specialized immune cells, plants have developed an elaborate immune machinery, composed of microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/PAMPs)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI), to defend against pathogens ( Jones and Dangl, 2006 29.

Activation of plant immunity leads to apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cytosolic Ca 2+ elevation, kinase cascade activation, and localized cell death known as the hypersensitive response (HR) ( Boller and Felix, 2009 4.

Immune activation confers resistance against invading pathogens, but constitutive immune responses are costly and impede growth and environmental fitness ( Bomblies et al., 2007 5.

Natural allelic variation underlying a major fitness trade-off in Arabidopsis thaliana Nature. 2010; 465 :632-636 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plant immunity therefore requires precise control to allow rapid responses upon pathogen infection while minimizing growth penalties under normal conditions. This is particularly important for field crops, which are constantly challenged by diverse pathogens ( Brown, 2002 7. Brown, J.K. Yield penalties of disease resistance in crops Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5 :339-344 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ning et al., 2017 44. Ning, Y. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Wang, G.L.

An energy-efficient and flexible immune system is advantageous for plant survival and crop production ( Barabaschi et al., 2020 2. Barabaschi, D. ∙ Tondelli, A. ∙ Valè, G. ...

Opin. Plant Biol. 2019; 50 :58-66 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Understanding how plants fine-tune immune homeostasis in diverse environments is critical for promoting secure crop production.
Various mechanisms have been deployed by plants to reduce the potential cost of excessive immune responses. For instance, expression of plant defense genes exhibits a rhythmic pattern under normal conditions, which enables anticipation of potential pathogen threat ( Goodspeed et al., 2012 23. Goodspeed, D. ∙ Chehab, E.W. ∙ Min-Venditti, A. ... Arabidopsis synchronizes jasmonate-mediated defense with insect circadian behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Plants can also be primed to a sensitized state after initial infection. This low level of basal immunity allows rapid activation upon subsequent pathogen attack ( Conrath et al., 2015 11. Conrath, U. ∙ Beckers, G.J. ∙ Langenbach, C.J. ... Priming for enhanced defense Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2015; 53 :97-119 Crossref Scopus (682) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, plants have evolved a number of factors that act to attenuate immune responses, such as the immune suppressors EDR1 ( Frye et al., 2001 21. Frye, C.A. ∙ Tang, D. ∙ Innes, R.W. Negative regulation of defense responses in plants by a conserved MAPKK kinase Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To facilitate infection, pathogens, in turn, have evolved mechanisms that hijack host cellular processes or immune modules through ETS pathways ( van Schie and Takken, 2014 57. van Schie, C.C. ∙ Takken, F.L.

Recently, it was reported that the bacterial effector HopBF1 mimics a host HSP90 client to facilitate pathogenicity ( Lopez et al., 2019 38. Lopez, V.A. ∙ Park, B.C. ∙ Nowak, D. ... A bacterial effector mimics a host HSP90 client to undermine immunity Cell. 2019; 179 :205-218.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), and virus proteins have co-opted two subcellular targeting systems to impair salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense ( Medina-Puche et al., 2020 42.

Like SA, ROS plays a central role in plant defense ( Boller and Felix, 2009 4. Boller, T. ∙ Felix, G.

ROS homeostasis must be tightly controlled to prevent plant cell damage ( Waszczak et al., 2018 62. Waszczak, C. ∙ Carmody, M. ∙ Kangasjärvi, J. Reactive oxygen species in plant signaling Annu. Rev.

The Ustilago maydis effector Pep1 suppresses plant immunity by inhibition of host peroxidase activity PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002684 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether plants and pathogens have adopted the same ROS-scavenging mechanism to fine-tune or suppress host immunity is unknown.
Here, we have conducted a long-term study to track the rice susceptibility-like gene RESISTANCE OF RICE TO DISEASES1 ( ROD1 ). ROD1 encodes a C2 domain Ca 2+ sensor that acts as a global regulator of immunity. We show that ROD1 promotes H 2 O 2 degradation by activating a catalase, CatB. ROD1 stability is fine-tuned by a pair of E3 ubiquitin ligases RIP1 and APIP6. ROD1 loss-of-function leads to robust and broad-spectrum resistance to multiple bacterial and fungal pathogens. ROD1 has a six-strand antiparallel β sheet structure, which is also found in a fungal blast effector, AvrPiz-t ( de Guillen et al., 2015 12. de Guillen, K. ∙ Ortiz-Vallejo, D. ∙ Gracy, J. ... Structure analysis uncovers a highly diverse but structurally conserved effector family in phytopathogenic fungi PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 :e1005228 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). ROD1 and AvrPiz-t share the same protein degradation and ROS-elimination cascade, supporting a model where a fungal effector has exploited the host protein-mediated immune regulation. We identify a naturally occurring, locally adaptive ROD1 allele that confers higher basal resistance without loss of crop yield, underlining the importance of this factor in balancing immunity and growth. Our study thus reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism where plant and pathogen factors suppress plant immune responses through the same cascade.

Section: Results

Rice productivity is threatened by three major diseases: rice blast caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae ( M. oryzae ), bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ), and sheath blight caused by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia solani ( R. solani ). Through a large-scale screen of rice germplasms and breeder’s collections, we identified a natural recessive broad-spectrum disease resistance variant, resistance of rice to diseases1 (rod1 ), from a TP309 ( japonica rice) breeding population. The rod1 variant exhibits strong resistance to rice blast, sheath blight, and bacterial blight ( Figures 1 A–1C).
Compared to TP309, rod1 accumulated much higher levels of SA and jasmonic acid (JA) ( Figure 1 D), indicating constitutive defense activation. In support of this, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that genes involved in ROS homeostasis and cell wall reinforcement were highly enriched, whereas genes related to Ca 2+ -binding were downregulated in rod1 ( Figures 1 E and 1F; Table S1 ). These data suggest a link between ROS metabolism and Ca 2+ -signaling in ROD1 -mediated immune regulation. Constitutively activated immunity in rod1 mutants compromised plant growth, leading to reduced grain yield. However, in a natural blast nursey trial, rod1 showed better growth and produced more seeds than TP309 ( Figures 1 G and 1H). This indicates superiority of the rod1 allele under disease stress.
We identified the ROD1 gene by map-based cloning. Using a large mapping population derived from a cross between rod1 and an indica accession Taichung Native1 (TN1), ROD1 was mapped to a 53-kb region near the telomere of chromosome 6 ( Figure S1 A). Comparison of TP309, Nipponbare ( japonica , the reference genome), and rod1 DNA sequences revealed a single nucleotide deletion in the exon of LOC_Os06 g03810 , that causes a frameshift in rod1 ( Figure S1 B). The identity of the ROD1 gene was confirmed using genetic complementation with a fragment containing the LOC_Os06 g03810 genomic sequence and 3,000-bp promoter region ( Figure S1 C). ROD1 protein is predicted to be 225 amino acids (aa) long and contains a C2 domain ( Figure 2 A). To further assess the role of ROD1 in disease resistance, we overexpressed ROD1 in TP309 using the maize Ubiquitin ( Ubi ) promoter ( Figures S1 D and S1E). The Ubi::ROD1 transgenic plants displayed increased susceptibility ( Figures S1 F–S1H), demonstrating that ROD1 is likely a suppressor of rice immunity.
In situ hybridization revealed that ROD1 is predominantly expressed in leaves, a common site of pathogen infection ( Figure 2 B). The expression of ROD1 could be induced by pathogen infection ( Figure 2 C). ROD1 is also highly expressed in the inflorescence meristem (IM) and young panicles ( Figure S1 I), implying a potential role in reproductive growth. Indeed, IM development was largely delayed in rod1 plants, leading to reduced seed production ( Figures S1 J–S1L). Conversely, overexpression of ROD1 using its endogenous promoter ( pROD1::ROD1 ) promoted panicle growth and increased grain yield ( Figures S1 K and S1L). Therefore, ROD1 plays distinct roles in rice disease resistance and growth fitness.
ROD1 orthologs are found across the flowering plants (angiosperms) but not in lower plant lineages (e.g., chlorophytes, mosses, and Marchantia) or early vascular plants such as fern ( Figures S2 A and S2B), suggesting that this class of C2 domain proteins emerged during a relatively late stage in plant evolution. ROD1-like proteins have high sequence similarity in monocot crops, but have diverged in Brassicaceae such as Arabidopsis thaliana ( Figure S2 B). We therefore tested whether ROD1-like proteins play a conserved role in immunity in cereals. Maize mutant of GRMZM2G069335 (here referred to as ZmROD1 ) was generated using CRISPR/Cas technology ( Figure S2 C). Compared to wild-type (WT), the ZmROD1 mutant ( CR-zmrod1 ) showed enhanced PR gene expression ( Figure S2 D) and increased resistance to R. solani ( Figure S2 E), suggesting that ROD1 and its orthologs constitute a specific type of susceptibility genes that play a conserved role across cereal plants.
C2 domains typically act as Ca 2+ sensors that bind to phosphoinositide lipids in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner, thereby targeting proteins to specific membrane regions ( Clapham, 2007 10. Clapham, D.E. Calcium signaling Cell. 2007; 131 :1047-1058 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3360) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rizo and Südhof, 1998 50. Rizo, J. ∙ Südhof, T.C. C2-domains, structure and function of a universal Ca 2+ -binding domain J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :15879-15882 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (729) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay with purified recombinant ROD1 proteins produced in E. coli , we confirmed that ROD1 binds to Ca 2+ with high affinity ( Figure 2 D). The aspartic acid residues (D) of C2 domains are responsible for Ca 2+ binding. We identified four D sites in ROD1 (D72, D85, D132, and D135). When these sites were substituted with asparagine (N), the Ca 2+ binding activity of the mutated proteins, ROD1 D132N and ROD1 D-quad , was greatly reduced ( Figure 2 D). Ca 2+ changes the electrostatic properties of C2 domains, enabling them to bind to negatively charged phosphoinositide lipids ( Murray and Honig, 2002 43. Murray, D. ∙ Honig, B. Electrostatic control of the membrane targeting of C2 domains Mol. Cell. 2002; 9 :145-154 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess the lipid binding capacity and specificity of ROD1, we incubated GST-ROD1 fusion protein with various lipids. ROD1 strongly associated with PI(4)P, PI(5)P, PI(3,5)P2, and had weaker affinity to PI(4,5)P2 and PA ( Figure S3 A). Lipid binding by ROD1 was abolished in the presence of EGTA, a specific Ca 2+ chelator. ROD1 D-quad also failed to bind to lipids ( Figure S3 A), indicating that Ca 2+ binding is a prerequisite for ROD1-lipid interaction.
Protein localization analysis showed that ROD1 is predominantly distributed at the cell periphery associated with the plasma membrane (PM), forming dispersed punctate structures ( Figure S3 B). Mutation of aspartic acid residues in the ROD1 C2 domain severely disrupted subcellular localization: the resulting YFP-ROD1 D132N , YFP-ROD1 D-doub , YFP-ROD1 D-trip , and YFP-ROD1 D-quad proteins aggregated into large cytoplasmic patches ( Figures 2 F, S3 C, and S3D). Interestingly, treatment with the PAMP elicitor (flg22) enhanced the PM accumulation of ROD1 ( Figures S3 E and S3F), implying that immune activation promotes localization of ROD1 to the PM.
We next used a genetic approach to investigate the role of Ca 2+ -sensing in ROD1-mediated immune suppression. ROD1 Ca 2+ -binding variants were expressed in rod1 under the control of the endogenous ROD1 promoter. ROD1 D132N and ROD1 D-quad , which are defective in Ca 2+ -binding and PM localization, failed to rescue the growth phenotypes of rod1 , and the transgenic plants still exhibited high resistance to different rice pathogens ( Figures 2 F–2I). These results collectively indicate that Ca 2+ -binding enables ROD1 association with phospholipids and PM localization. These molecular and cellular events are crucial for ROD1 function in immunity and plant growth regulation.
The functions of single C2 domain proteins have not been well documented in plants. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ROD1-mediated suppression of immunity, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen to identify ROD1 interacting proteins. Using ROD1 as a bait, we screened a cDNA library generated from M. oryzae -infected rice leaves ( Zhai et al., 2019 72. Zhai, K. ∙ Deng, Y. ∙ Liang, D. ... RRM transcription factors interact with NLRs and regulate broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :996-1009.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) and uncovered two RING E3 ubiquitin ligases, ROD1 interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and AvrPiz-t interacting protein 6 (APIP6) ( Park et al., 2012 48. Park, C.H. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Shirsekar, G. ... The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :4748-4762 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S4 A–S4D). Both RIP1 and APIP6 mRNAs are expressed in leaves ( Figure S4 E), and are induced by pathogen infection ( Figure S4 F). Similar to APIP6 ( Park et al., 2012 48. Park, C.H. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Shirsekar, G. ... The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :4748-4762 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ), RIP1 also possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity ( Figure S4 G). When the TF-ROD1 fusion protein was incubated with either RIP1 or APIP6, high molecular weight bands were detected ( Figures 3 A and S4 H). These bands were lost in the RIP1 H74Y or APIP6 H58Y mutants that lack ubiquitin ligase activity, suggesting that ROD1 is ubiquitinated by RIP1 and APIP6.
To determine the effect of ubiquitin modification on ROD1 protein stability, we generated RIP1 and APIP6 knockout mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 ( CR-rip1 and CR-apip6 ) ( Figure 3 B). We also generated plants overexpressing these factors using the maize Ubi1 promoter. ROD1 protein levels in the Ubi::RIP1 and Ubi::APIP6 plants, as detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ROD1 antibody, were reduced. Conversely, ROD1 was stabilized in the CR-rip1 and CR-apip6 mutants ( Figure 3 C). Together, these in vitro and in planta assays indicate that RIP1 and APIP6 target ROD1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
To investigate the immune output of RIP1- and APIP6-mediated ROD1 destruction, we analyzed disease resistance of the RIP1 and APIP6 transgenic plants. Both CR-rip1 and CR-apip6 plants showed compromised resistance to M. oryzae , R. solani , or Xoo . In contrast, RIP1 and APIP6 overexpression resulted in enhanced resistance to these pathogens ( Figures 3 D and 3E), indicating that RIP1 and APIP6-mediated turnover of ROD1 levels regulates immune activation.
Our Y2H screen also recovered a catalase, CatB, as a candidate ROD1 binding factor ( Figures S5 A and S5B). The interaction between ROD1 and CatB was validated by split luciferase complementation (SLC) and co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) assays ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Catalase is a ROS scavenging enzyme that catalyzes H 2 O 2 turnover, which has been shown to inhibit immunity in Arabidopsis ( Yuan et al., 2017a 70. Yuan, H.M. ∙ Liu, W.C. ∙ Lu, Y.T. CATALASE2 coordinates SA-mediated repression of both auxin accumulation and JA biosynthesis in plant defenses Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 21 :143-155 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the rice CR-catb mutant generated by CRISPR/Cas9 showed higher PR gene expression and enhanced disease resistance, indicating a negative role for CatB in rice immune responses ( Figures S5 A–S5D).
To determine the biological significance of the ROD1-CatB interaction, we first investigated the effect of ROD1 on the biochemical activity of CatB. We found that CatB-mediated H 2 O 2 degradation was accelerated by ROD1 but not the Ca 2+ -binding mutants ROD1 D132N or ROD1 D-quad ( Figures 4 C and 4D), suggesting that ROD1 stimulates CatB activity in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. We ectopically expressed CatB-FLAG in TP309 and rod1 plants, and purified the fusion proteins through immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody. We found that the H 2 O 2 degradation activity of CatB-FLAG isolated from the rod1 background was lower than CatB-FLAG from TP309 ( Figure 4 E), indicating that ROD1 indeed contributes to CatB activity in planta . Further supporting this conclusion, H 2 O 2 scavenging activity in total protein extracts from rod1 leaves was 65% of that from TP309 control. ROD1 overexpression increased catalase activity by ∼30% ( Figure 4 F). Consequently, rod1 plants accumulated higher levels of H 2 O 2 than WT ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Moreover, elicitor (flg22)-induced H 2 O 2 production was enhanced in rod1 , but compromised in ROD1 overexpression plants ( Figure 4 I), suggesting a role for ROD1 in immune suppression through promoting ROS scavenging.
GFP-CatB protein was mainly localized in the peroxisomes, whereas we also detected weak fluorescence signals at the PM ( Figure 4 J), consistent with previous findings ( Zhang et al., 2016 75. Zhang, Z. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Xie, Z. ... Association-dissociation of glycolate oxidase with catalase in rice: a potential switch to modulate intracellular H 2 O 2 levels Mol. Plant. 2016; 9 :737-748 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peroxisomal CatB protein levels were reduced when co-expressed with mCherry-ROD1, and the majority of GFP-CatB signal was instead found at the PM ( Figure 4 J). This is reminiscent of STRK1- and CPK8-mediated PM re-localization of catalases in rice and Arabidopsis , respectively ( Zhou et al., 2018 77. Zhou, Y.B. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Tang, D.Y. ... The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase STRK1 phosphorylates and activates CatC, thereby regulating H 2 O 2 homeostasis and improving salt tolerance in rice Plant Cell. 2018; 30 :1100-1118 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zou et al., 2015 79. Zou, J.J. ∙ Li, X.D. ∙ Ratnasekera, D. ... Arabidopsis CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE8 and CATALASE3 function in abscisic acid-mediated signaling and H 2 O 2 homeostasis in stomatal guard cells under drought stress Plant Cell. 2015; 27 :1445-1460 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data indicate that ROD1 promotes localization of CatB to the PM. This was further verified in the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, showing that the interaction between ROD1 and CatB occurs mainly at the PM region ( Figure 4 K).
Finally, we evaluated the effect of the ROD1-CatB interaction on plant immune responses. Using the cell death assay in N. benthamiana , we found that the MLA10-induced hypersensitive response (HR) ( Bai et al., 2012 1. Bai, S. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Chang, C. ... Structure-function analysis of barley NLR immune receptor MLA10 reveals its cell compartment specific activity in cell death and disease resistance PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002752 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ) was partially suppressed by CatB, and almost completely abolished by ROD1 and CatB co-expression ( Figures 4 L and 4M). These results collectively suggest that ROD1 plays dual roles in CatB enzyme activity and subcellular localization: it recruits CatB to the PM and stimulates CatB-mediated ROS scavenging, which ensure spatiotemporal precision of ROS metabolism thus contribute to immune suppression.
Given the crucial roles of ROD1 in immune regulation, we next investigated its variation in rice germplasm. Comparison of ROD1 sequences in different accessions revealed low nucleotide diversity (π = 4.17e−07) ( Figure 5 A), suggesting a selective sweep at this locus. Among the 12 subgroups of ∼3,000 rice collections ( Wang et al., 2018 60. Wang, W. ∙ Mauleon, R. ∙ Hu, Z. ... Genomic variation in 3,010 diverse accessions of Asian cultivated rice Nature. 2018; 557 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ), negative Tajima’s D values were observed mainly in the indica but not the japonica subgroups ( Figure 5 B), implying that ROD1 underwent differential selection during indica rice adaptation. From the 262 Asian cultivated rice accessions, we identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the ROD1 coding region, SNP1 A/C , a non-synonymous nucleotide polymorphism with an amino acid change from proline to threonine, and SNP2 G/C , a synonymous nucleotide polymorphism ( Figures 5 C and S6 A; Table S2 ). Based on these two SNPs, the rice cultivars can be grouped into three haplotypes: AG (type I), CG (type II), and AC (type III) ( Figure S6 A). We randomly selected 178 accessions from these three haplotypes and assayed their basal resistance to R. solani in the paddy field. This analysis exploits the fact that no major resistance genes are present against this necrotrophic pathogen in rice ( Deng et al., 2020 15. Deng, Y. ∙ Ning, Y. ∙ Yang, D.L. ... Molecular basis of disease resistance and perspectives on breeding strategies for resistance improvement in crops Mol. Plant. 2020; 13 :1402-1419 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), which would otherwise interfere with the evaluation. We found that the lesion length of type I and type III (both SNP1 A ) plants was significantly shorter than that of type II (SNP1 C ) plants ( Figure 5 D), indicating that SNP1 A/C is associated with altered field disease resistance. We next introduced ROD1 containing either SNP1 A or SNP1 C into rod1 and found that both genes could rescue the growth phenotypes of rod1 ( Figure 5 E). Although ROD1 (SNP1 C ) could fully suppress disease resistance in rod1 mutants, the effect of ROD1 (SNP1 A ) was less robust ( Figure 5 F), confirming that SNP1 A/C indeed impacts basal defense.
To further determine the differential functions of SNP1 A and SNP1 C , we generated chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) in a high-yield elite rice variety Huajingxian74 (HJX74). The chromosomal region around ROD1 in HJX74, which contains SNP1 A , was substituted with DNA fragments from Katy and Basmati (both harboring SNP1 C ), giving rise to CSSL-1 and CSSL-2, respectively ( Figure S6 B). A pathogen inoculation assay showed that, compared to Huajingxian74, the two CSSLs developed larger lesions ( Figure 5 G), confirming that ROD1 (SNP1 A ) is a more resistant allele than ROD1 (SNP1 C ). However, no change in grain production was observed for the CSSL lines ( Figures S6 C and S6D), despite their higher resistance. Our results suggest that the SNP1 A/C does not affect growth fitness.
Because ROD1 mRNA and protein levels were comparable between HJX74, CSSL-1, and CSSL-2 ( Figures S6 E and S6F), we speculate that this A/C variant might interfere with the activation of CatB by ROD1. To address this possibility, we examined the impact of ROD1 (SNP1 A /SNP1 C ) on CatB-mediated ROS scavenging. We found that CatB was less active in the presence of ROD1 (SNP1 A ) than ROD1 (SNP1 C ) ( Figure S6 G). Consistently, the proteins extracted from ROD1 (SNP1 A )/ rod1 complemented plants showed a 10% reduction in H 2 O 2 hydrolysis activity compared to those from the ROD1 (SNP1 C )/ rod1 plants ( Figure S6 H). Differential activities of ROD1(SNP1 A ) and ROD1(SNP1 C ) were further verified by the tobacco cell death assay, showing that ROD1(SNP1 A ) only partially enhanced CatB-mediated suppression of MLA10-triggered cell death ( Figure S6 I). These data together suggest that natural variation of ROD1 modifies its effect on catalase activation and thereby immune regulation.
Analysis of ROD1 allele frequency in different rice varieties revealed subspecies-specific distribution ( Figure S6 J). Of the 803 japonica varieties analyzed, only 5.6% (45/803) carry the SNP1 A allele; in contrast, this allele is present in 57.2% of 1,531 (876/1531) indica varieties ( Figure 5 C). To track the evolutionary origin of SNP1, we compared ROD1 sequences in 44 wild rice accessions and identified only 4 accessions with SNP1 A , whereas the other 40 accessions all contain SNP1 C . Therefore, SNP1 A is mainly retained in indica , whereas SNP1 C is predominant in both wild rice and japonica . The striking difference in SNP1 A and SNP1 C distribution between the two rice subspecies prompted us to investigate their geographic distribution. We found that the accessions containing SNP1 A are mainly enriched in tropical and subtropical (low-latitude) regions, whereas accessions containing SNP1 C tend to be enriched in temperate zones ( Figure 5 H). Together, these results demonstrate that allelic variation of ROD1 fine-tunes ROS homeostasis thus contributing to subspecies-specific disease resistance.
Thus far, our data indicate that ROD1, together with the E3 ubiquitinin ligases RIP1, APIP6, and the catalase CatB, comprise a molecular circuitry that regulates rice ROS homeostasis and immunity ( Figure 6 A). APIP6 was previously reported to interact with and mediate the degradation of AvrPiz-t, an effector secreted by the fungal pathogen M. oryzae ( Park et al., 2012 48. Park, C.H. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Shirsekar, G. ... The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :4748-4762 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the high similarity between RIP1 and APIP6, we tested whether RIP1 also targets AvrPiz-t, and observed that RIP1 interacted with AvrPiz-t ( Figure S7 A). Hence, both the host susceptibility protein ROD1 and the pathogen virulence protein AvrPiz-t are recognized and destabilized by a common pair of E3 ligases.
AvrPiz-t interferes with host immunity in rice ( Park et al., 2012 48. Park, C.H. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Shirsekar, G. ... The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :4748-4762 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Because AvrPiz-t and ROD1 are targeted by the same E3 ligases and both suppress plant immunity, we next asked whether AvrPiz-t regulates the same immune regulatory circuitry as ROD1. To address this possibility, we performed Y2H and coIP assays, and found that AvrPiz-t strongly interacts with CatB ( Figures S7 B and S7C). Next, we assessed the influence of AvrPiz-t on CatB activity. AvrPiz-t greatly enhanced the efficiency of CatB-mediated H 2 O 2 scavenging ( Figure S7 D). Moreover, expression of AvrPiz-t in rice led to increased catalase activity ( Figure S7 E), reduced H 2 O 2 content ( Figure S7 F), and increased disease susceptibility ( Figures S7 G and S7H). Therefore, AvrPiz-t and ROD1 feed into the same ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation pathway and promote catalase-mediated ROS scavenging as an immune suppression strategy in host cells.
To further investigate the functional relevance of the similarity between AvrPiz-t and ROD1, we performed mutual genetic complementation assays in rice and in the pathogen. AvrPiz-t was expressed in rod1 plants under the control of the ROD1 promoter. The pROD1::AvrPiz-t chimera largely suppressed the disease resistance phenotypes seen in rod1 ( Figures 6 B and 6C). As a control, another rice blast fungal effector, AvrPik, which does not interact with APIP6, RIP1, or CatB, was tested. AvrPik expression had no effect on rod1 disease resistance ( Figures S7 I and S7J), suggesting that AvrPiz-t specifically acts on the ROD1-mediated immune suppression circuit. We next explored whether ROD1 can substitute for AvrPiz-t function in pathogen virulence. TH12 is a M. oryzae strain with a loss-of-function allele of AvrPiz-t , which thus becomes virulent in the variety ZH11 carrying the cognate NLR gene Piz-t / Pizh-1 ( Xie et al., 2019 64. Xie, Z. ∙ Yan, B. ∙ Shou, J. ... A nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat receptor pair confers broad-spectrum disease resistance through physical association in rice Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2019; 374 :20180308 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that ectopic expression of SP AvrPiz-t -ROD1 (a chimeric protein composed of AvrPiz-t signal peptide and ROD1) in TH12 (TH12 ROD1 ) partially restored the avirulence in comparison with TH12 AvrPiz-t , leading to smaller and restricted lesions in ZH11 ( Figure 6 D). In contrast, the virulence of TH12 in TP309, a rice variety that lacks Piz-t , was not changed by ROD1expression ( Figure 6 D). These results suggest that pathogen-produced SP AvrPiz-t -ROD1 converts TH12 into a partially avirulent strain and activates immunity in the presence of host Piz-t.
The above results demonstrate that ROD1 and AvrPiz-t share a common signaling module in host cells. In addition, although its' Ca 2+ binding activity was very weak ( Figure S7 K), AvrPiz-t was also found to associate with phosphoinositide lipids such as PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2, similar to ROD1 ( Figure S7 L). The interplay between ROD1 and AvrPiz-t is reminiscent of the functional or structural mimicry between mammalian and bacterial proteins ( Elde and Malik, 2009 20. Elde, N.C. ∙ Malik, H.S. The evolutionary conundrum of pathogen mimicry Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7 :787-797 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). AvrPiz-t belongs to the MAX effector family, members of which have a conserved six β strand sandwich structure; however, little is known about the virulence mechanisms and targets of MAX effectors in plant hosts ( de Guillen et al., 2015 12. de Guillen, K. ∙ Ortiz-Vallejo, D. ∙ Gracy, J. ... Structure analysis uncovers a highly diverse but structurally conserved effector family in phytopathogenic fungi PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 :e1005228 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maqbool et al., 2015 41.

Nyarko, A. ∙ Singarapu, K.K. ∙ Figueroa, M. ... Solution NMR structures of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis ToxB and its inactive homolog reveal potential determinants of toxin activity J. Biol.

Solution structure of the Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence protein AvrPiz-t J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 55 :219-223 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). This anti-parallel β sandwich structure also exists in C2 domains from diverse organisms (SMART: SM00239). Using homology modeling, we found that, similarly to AvrPiz-t, the ROD1 C2 domain consists of six β strands that are organized into an anti-parallel β sandwich ( Figure 6 E). Given that protein function is largely determined by 3D conformation, the structural mimicry between ROD1 and AvrPiz-t may contribute to their functional convergence on the same immune suppression machinery.

Section: Discussion

Plants are challenged by numerous pathogens in their natural habitats thus must maintain an efficient, dynamic, and hierarchical immune system ( Jones and Dangl, 2006 29. Jones, J.D. ∙ Dangl, J.L. The plant immune system Nature. 2006; 444 :323-329 Crossref Scopus (9642) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because immune activation imposes trade-offs on plant growth, a delicate balance between warding off potential pathogens and avoiding negative impacts on growth fitness must be maintained. This is particularly important for cereal crops, which have been subjected to extensive domesticated selection of traits including high grain yield and reliable diseases resistance ( Huang et al., 2010 26. Huang, X. ∙ Wei, X. ∙ Sang, T. ... Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces Nat. Genet. 2010; 42 :961-967 Crossref Scopus (1631) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2019 9. Chen, E. ∙ Huang, X. ∙ Tian, Z. ... The genomics of Oryza species provides insights into rice domestication and heterosis Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2019; 70 :639-665 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it remains unclear how the balance between immunity and growth is coordinated in crops. Here, we have shown that the Ca 2+ -binding protein ROD1 defines a specific immune circuit that integrates Ca 2+ -sensing, ROS metabolism, and ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation to fine-tune immune responses and balance the conflict between defense and growth. By regulating ROS-scavenging-mediated immune suppression, ROD1 equilibrates immunity and growth fitness under normal conditions. Upon pathogen infection, ROD1-CatB is activated to buffer the immunity-triggered ROS burst. Pathogen infection also induces two E3 ligases, RIP1 and APIP6, which promote ROD1 degradation to sustain ROS production, thus ensuring reliable immune activation in the face of disease ( Figure 7 ).
Functional mimicry has been observed in different pathogens. For example, a wild species of wheat has adopted a fungal glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene through horizontal gene transfer to deploy resistance against Fusarium head blight ( Wang et al., 2020 61. Wang, H. ∙ Sun, S. ∙ Ge, W. ... Horizontal gene transfer of Fhb7 from fungus underlies Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat Science. 2020; 368 :eaba5435 Crossref Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that the pathogen effector AvrPiz-t structurally mimics ROD1 and both AvrPiz-t and ROD1 can stimulate CatB activity to degrade H 2 O 2 . Therefore, our study provides an example of cross-kingdom convergence on the regulation of ROS homeostasis, an additional arena in the arms race between plants and pathogens. Further investigations will reveal whether similar structural mimicry is deployed in other pathosystems.
Ca 2+ is a prominent second messenger that mediates plant responses to abiotic and biotic stimuli ( Dodd et al., 2010 17. Dodd, A.N. ∙ Kudla, J. ∙ Sanders, D. The language of calcium signaling Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61 :593-620 Crossref Scopus (1022) PubMed Google Scholar ). During plant immune responses, elevated cytosolic Ca 2+ signals are perceived and decoded by Ca 2+ sensor proteins such as calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs or CPKs), which, together with the PRR-associated kinase BIK1, phosphorylate the NADPH oxidase RBOHD to stimulate ROS production ( Dubiella et al., 2013 19. Dubiella, U. ∙ Seybold, H. ∙ Durian, G. ... Calcium-dependent protein kinase/NADPH oxidase activation circuit is required for rapid defense signal propagation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :8744-8749 Crossref Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kadota et al., 2014 30. Kadota, Y. ∙ Sklenar, J. ∙ Derbyshire, P. ... Direct regulation of the NADPH oxidase RBOHD by the PRR-associated kinase BIK1 during plant immunity Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :43-55 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2014 35. Li, L. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Yu, L. ... The FLS2-associated kinase BIK1 directly phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RbohD to control plant immunity Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 15 :329-338 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (573) PubMed Google Scholar ). Belonging to another class of Ca 2+ sensors, ROD1 directly interacts with catalase and enhances its H 2 O 2 scavenging activity. The Ca 2+ -ROD1-CatB cascade may antagonize a Ca 2+ -elicited ROS burst thus maintaining immune homeostasis ( Yuan et al., 2017b 71. Yuan, P. ∙ Jauregui, E. ∙ Du, L. ... Calcium signatures and signaling events orchestrate plant-microbe interactions Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2017; 38 :173-183 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunity-triggered ROS accumulates mainly in the apoplastic space and has been proposed to be inhibited by pathogens ( Guo et al., 2019 24. Guo, Y. ∙ Yao, S. ∙ Yuan, T. ... The spatiotemporal control of KatG2 catalase-peroxidase contributes to the invasiveness of Fusarium graminearum in host plants Mol. Plant Pathol. 2019; 20 :685-700 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hemetsberger et al., 2012 25. Hemetsberger, C. ∙ Herrberger, C. ∙ Zechmann, B. ... The Ustilago maydis effector Pep1 suppresses plant immunity by inhibition of host peroxidase activity PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002684 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qi et al., 2017 49. Qi, J. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Gong, Z. ... Apoplastic ROS signaling in plant immunity Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2017; 38 :92-100 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ). The punctate pattern of ROD1 in the PM, and the recruitment of CatB to the PM, would constitutes a shortcut that enables spatiotemporal precision in ROS degradation. Structural analysis may resolve the molecular basis of the ROD1-CatB complex functioning as an immune suppression hub.
Disease resistance and grain yield are the two major targets of rice breeding ( Huang et al., 2010 26. Huang, X. ∙ Wei, X. ∙ Sang, T. ... Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces Nat. Genet. 2010; 42 :961-967 Crossref Scopus (1631) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2019 9. Chen, E. ∙ Huang, X. ∙ Tian, Z. ... The genomics of Oryza species provides insights into rice domestication and heterosis Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2019; 70 :639-665 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Increased seed production of rod1 in the blast nursey, as compared to the parent variety, suggests that pathogen resistance conferred by the rod1 mutation outweighs the negative effect on growth during a disease outbreak. Intriguingly, we have identified a natural variant of ROD1 that increases field disease resistance without influencing other agronomic traits. This resistant allele, ROD1 (SNP1 A ), attenuates the activation of CatB-mediated ROS scavenging. ROD1 (SNP1 A ) is mainly distributed in low-latitude areas and enriched in indica rice varieties. This correlates with the wide cultivation of indica rice in tropical and subtropical regions ( Huang et al., 2012 27. Huang, X. ∙ Kurata, N. ∙ Wei, X. ... A map of rice genome variation reveals the origin of cultivated rice Nature. 2012; 490 :497-501 Crossref Scopus (1217) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating differential defense strategies adopted in rice subspecies ( Liao et al., 2016 36. Liao, J. ∙ Huang, H. ∙ Meusnier, I. ... Pathogen effectors and plant immunity determine specialization of the blast fungus to rice subspecies eLife. 2016; 5 :e19377 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Vergne et al., 2010 58. Vergne, E. ∙ Grand, X. ∙ Ballini, E. ... Preformed expression of defense is a hallmark of partial resistance to rice blast fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae BMC Plant Biol. 2010; 10 :206 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that pathogenic microbes have shaped plant defense and diversity ( Delaux and Schornack, 2021 13. Delaux, P.M. ∙ Schornack, S. Plant evolution driven by interactions with symbiotic and pathogenic microbes Science. 2021; 371 :eaba6605 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), and that high temperature and humidity tends to benefit pathogen spreading ( Beattie, 2011 3. Beattie, G.A. Water relations in the interaction of foliar bacterial pathogens with plants Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2011; 49 :533-555 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xin et al., 2016 65. Xin, X.F. ∙ Nomura, K. ∙ Aung, K. ... Bacteria establish an aqueous living space in plants crucial for virulence Nature. 2016; 539 :524-529 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ), the latitude-dependent distribution of ROD1 (SNP1 A ) likely reflects an adaptation to high pathogen pressure, for example by R. solani , caused by local climate and agroecological conditions. Our data therefore argue that the selection of immune alleles through local adaptation is likely associated with specific agroecology. As elite rice varieties containing ROD1 (SNP1 A ) exhibit higher field resistance without an obvious penalty in yield, ROD1 may represent an elite target in crop breeding for high yield and broad-spectrum disease resistance.
We show that the host protein ROD1 and the fungal pathogen effector AvrPiz-t converge on ROS scavenging-mediated immune suppression. However, it is unclear how ROD1 and AvrPiz-t promote catalase activity biochemically. The future challenge will be to determine the structural and biochemical features of the ROD1- and AvrPiz-t-CatB complexes. Another limitation of the study is with ROD1-mediated calcium signaling. Although it is clear that ROD1 binds and senses calcium, whether ROD1 regulates calcium signaling that is involved in immune responses will require future studies.

Rice varieties, including TP309 and rod1 mutant ( japonica ), Taichung Native 1 (TN1, indica ), and Zhonghua 11 (ZH11, japonica ), were used in this study. All rice wild-type and transgenic plants were grown in protected paddy fields at the Shanghai or Hainan Island experimental stations. For experiments with seedlings, plants were grown in a growth chamber under the conditions of 12-h day, 28°C, 80% RH followed by 12-h night, 26°C, 60% RH.
Maize ( Zea mays , accession C01) plants were grown in the greenhouse with temperature between 25°C and 32°C. Tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) plants were grown at 22°C under long-day conditions (16-h day/8-h night) and 3∼4 weeks old leaves were used for transient expression experiments.
The hemibiotrophic rice blast fungus Magnarpothe oryzae isolate TH12, the transformants TH12 AvrPiz-T and TH12 ROD1 , the hemibiotrophic bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ) Philippine strain P6 (PXO99A), and the necrotrophic sheath blight fungus Rhizoctonia solani ( R. solani ) AG1-IA (isolate RH-9) were used in this study.
The rod1 allele was initially isolated from a TP309 ( japonica ) breeding population, which was crossed with TP309 to purify the background. The rod1 mutant was crossed with TN1 ( indica ) to generate an F2 mapping population. ROD1 was roughly delimited to an interval between two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers RM587 and RM597 near the telomere of Chromosome 6. Due to a low recombination ratio in this region, a large mapping population was generated and ∼10,000 F 2 individuals were used for fine mapping. With newly developed InDel and CAPS markers, the ROD1 locus was narrowed down to a 53-kb DNA region. There are seven open reading frames (ORFs) in this region. Genomic DNA fragments of this region were amplified from rod1 and TP309 plants, sequenced, and compared using MegAlign (DNASTAR).
For complementation, genomic DNA containing the ROD1 promoter as well its coding region was amplified and inserted into pCambia1300. The resulting construct 1300-pROD1::ROD1 was transformed into rod1 calli via Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated transformation. More than 20 independent transgenic lines were produced that could successfully rescue the rod1 mutant phenotypes.
1300-pROD1::ROD1 was also transformed into TP309 background, resulting in ROD1 overexpression plants driven its native promoter. For ROD1 overexpression driven by the maize UBIQUTIN1 promoter, ROD1 genomic region was inserted into the vector pUN1301. The resulting pUN1301-ROD1 construct was transformed into TP309 plants to produce more than 20 independent overexpression lines.
APIP6 and RIP1 overexpression was driven by the maize UBIQUTIN1 promoter, APIP6 and RIP1 cDNAs were inserted into the vector pUN1301. The resulting pUN1301-APIP6 and pUN1301-RIP1 constructs were transformed into TP309 and rod1 plants to produce more than 15 independent overexpression lines.
For CatB overexpression driven by the maize UBIQUTIN1 promoter, CatB cDNA fused with FLAG was inserted into the vector pUN1301. The resulting pUN1301-CatB-FLAG construct was transformed into TP309 and rod1 plants to produce more than 15 independent overexpression lines.
ROD1 A was amplified from TN1 ( indica ) and inserted into the plasmid 1300-pROD1::ROD1 which was digested by BamHI and Sac I to generate 1300-pROD1::ROD1 A . The resulting construct 1300-pROD1::ROD1 A was transformed into the rod1 background, to produce more than 20 independent transgenic lines. 1300-pROD1::AvrPiz-t and 1300-pROD1::AvrPik were transformed into the rod1 background to produce more than 15 independent overexpression lines
For CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout mutation, two 20-bp gene-specific guide RNA sequences targeting APIP6 or RIP1 were synthesized, annealed, and ligated into pOs-sgRNA, which was subcloned into the vector pYLCRISPR/Cas9-MH ( Ma et al., 2015 39. Ma, X. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Zhu, Q. ... A robust CRISPR/Cas9 system for convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in monocot and dicot plants Mol. Plant. 2015; 8 :1274-1284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1617) PubMed Google Scholar ). The constructs were transformed into TP309 Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated transformation. More than 15 independent lines were generated for each transformation. PCR-based sequencing was performed to verify the mutation sites of the target genes.
For CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout mutation in maize, two guide RNA sequences from the ZmROD1 coding region were cloned into pYLCRISPR/Cas9-MH (Bar+) vector to generate the ZmROD1 CRISPR/Cas9 construct. The resulting CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids were introduced into the maize accession C01 using Agrobacterium tumefaciens . Mutant lines were confirmed by PCR followed by sequencing.
Blast fungal inoculation was conducted as previously described ( Deng et al., 2017 14. Deng, Y. ∙ Zhai, K. ∙ Xie, Z. ... Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance Science. 2017; 355 :962-965 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhai et al., 2019 72. Zhai, K. ∙ Deng, Y. ∙ Liang, D. ... RRM transcription factors interact with NLRs and regulate broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :996-1009.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, M. oryzae (isolate TH12) was cultured on complete agar medium at 25°C for 10 days to produce spores. Leaves at tillering stage were punch-inoculated with spores diluted in distilled H 2 O at a concentration of 1 × 10 5 spores/mL. For blast inoculation in seedlings, two-week-old plants were sprayed with blast spore suspensions. Inoculated seedlings were kept in a dew growth chamber at 26°C for 24 h in darkness, and then grown at 26°C with 12 h/12 h (day/night) and 90% relative humidity for 7 days. Lesion lengths were measured and fungal growth was determined using quantitative PCR ( Kawano et al., 2010 31. Kawano, Y. ∙ Akamatsu, A. ∙ Hayashi, K. ... Activation of a Rac GTPase by the NLR family disease resistance protein Pit plays a critical role in rice innate immunity Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7 :362-375 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ) to measure the amount of Pot2 transposon DNA, which was normalized to the rice ubiquitin gene ( LOC_Os03 g13170 ). PCR primers are listed in Table S3 .
Sheath blight inoculation was carried out at tillering stages in the paddy field as previously reported with slight modification ( Yin et al., 2018 68. Yin, X. ∙ Zou, B. ∙ Hong, X. ... Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance Plant Biotechnol. J. 2018; 16 :1476-1487 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA (isolate RH-9) was cultured on PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) plates for 2 d at 28°C. Short (0.8-1.0 cm) wooden toothpicks were sterilized and co-incubated with fungal plugs for 3 d at 28°C. The fungi growing toothpicks were then inserted into the third leaf sheath. Sheath blight symptom was recorded at 7 dpi with more than 20 sheaths each genotype (2 sheaths per plant) analyzed.
For the Xoo infection assay, bacterial strain PXO99A was grown on a peptone sucrose agar (PSA) medium at 28°C for 3 days. The bacteria were collected and then suspended in sterilized water at a concentration of OD600 = 1.0, which were used to infect two-month-old plants (tillering stage) by the leaf-clipping method ( Gao et al., 2017 22. Gao, M. ∙ Yin, X. ∙ Yang, W. ... GDSL lipases modulate immunity through lipid homeostasis in rice PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006724 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lesion length was measured at 14 dpi. All fungal and bacterial infections were repeated independently at least three times.
Field evaluation of rice blast resistance was performed as previously described ( Deng et al., 2017 14. Deng, Y. ∙ Zhai, K. ∙ Xie, Z. ... Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance Science. 2017; 355 :962-965 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, ∼100 rice plants of each genotype were grown in the Donghui blast nursery (Zhejiang, China). Blast disease was recorded at tillering stage, and grain production was measured at mature stage. Plants grown in a neighbor non-diseased paddy field in the same mountain area were assayed as a control for grain production.
To generate ROD1 Ca 2+ binding site mutants, the mutation sites were introduced using primers. The plasmid SK-ROD1 containing ROD1 coding sequence was used as a template for PCR-based mutagenesis. The PCR products were self-ligated. The SK-ROD1-D-doub was used as template to generate ROD1-D-trip by PCR. ROD-D-quad was generated by PCR using SK-ROD1-D-doub as template. All constructs were validated by sequencing. The resulting mutation constructs 1300-pROD1::ROD D72N , 1300-pROD1::ROD D132N , and 1300-pROD1::ROD D-quad were transformed into rod1 calli. More than 15 independent transgenic lines were used for phenotypic analysis.
For expression of ROD1 in M. oryzae TH12 strain, ROD1 coding sequence (using primers ROD1-CDS-PstI-F and ROD1-CDS-HindIII-R, Table S3 ) was fused with the signal peptide of AvrPiz-t (using primers Apt-1192-NotI-F and Apt-SP-PstI-R, Table S3 ). The coding sequences of AvrPiz-t was cloned into vector pBC1532 by PCR using primers ( Table S3 ). M. oryzae transformation was performed as described previously ( Talbot et al., 1993 53. Talbot, N.J. ∙ Ebbole, D.J. ∙ Hamer, J.E. Identification and characterization of MPG1, a gene involved in pathogenicity from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea Plant Cell. 1993; 5 :1575-1590 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ) with slight modifications. In details, a 3 cm 2 square of mycelium was macerated in 200-300 mL liquid media and incubated at 28°C for 48 h on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. The mycelium was suspended in 2 mL of cell wall digestion solution [15 mg/ml Lysing Enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum (Sigma L1412), 25 mg/mL Driselase from Basidiomycetes sp. (Sigma D9515), 0.4 mg/mL chitinase from Streptomyces griseus (Sigma C6137), in 0.7M NaCl buffer (pH5.8)] at room temperature on a rotary shaker at 60 rpm for 3 h. The fungal protoplasts were filtered through 3 layers of Miracloth and harvested by centrifuge at 4,100 g for 10 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 10 mL of STC buffer (1.2 M sorbitol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM CaCl 2 ). 150 μL protoplasts (1 × 10 8 cells/ml) were mixed with 2 μg DNA and incubated at room temperature for 25 min. After adding 1 mL PTC buffer (60% polyethylene glycol 4000, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM CaCl 2 ), the mixture was incubated for another 25 min. Next, 5 mL of TB3 [0.3% Yeast Extract, 0.3% Casamina acids (sigma C7290), 20% Sucrose] was added, and the protoplasts were cultured for 12-18 h at 28°C. The protoplasts were poured onto 150-mm plates. A selective overlay of 0.75% TB3 agar containing 100 μg /mL HygB was added. After incubation at 30°C in the dark for 6 days, transformants were picked to CM plates and allowed to sporulate. Single conidia were then isolated from each transformant and confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Y2H screening was carried out to identify ROD1 interacting proteins used a rice cDNA library developed from mRNAs prepared from rice seedling infected by rice blast as previously described ( Zhai et al., 2019 72. Zhai, K. ∙ Deng, Y. ∙ Liang, D. ... RRM transcription factors interact with NLRs and regulate broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :996-1009.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, ROD1 was amplified with primers F: CACCATGTCGGAGGCGATGTT and R: CGGGTTAGTCAACGTCTCG to generate target coding sequence, then a BP recombination reaction was performed to generate pENTR-ROD1 entry vector, and ROD1 protein was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain in vector pDEST32 using a LR recombination reaction (Invitrogen). The resulting construct was used as a bait to screen a cDNA library. For the Y2H assay, the coding sequences of ROD1 , APIP6 , RIP1 , CatB , AvrPiz-t and AvrPik were amplified with gene specific primers ( Table S3 ) and cloned into the yeast expression vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT7. The resulting constructs were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109. The yeast transformants were grown on nutrient-restricted mediums to assess interactions between various protein combinations.
To verify the protein interactions in planta , we carried out Co-IP assays. The ROD1 coding sequence was amplified and cloned into the vector pCAMBIA1300-35S-eGFP(C)-rbcsE9. APIP6 (Δ) and RIP1(Δ) coding sequences were cloned into the vector pCAMBIA1300-35S-4Myc(C) to generate expression vectors. The AvrPiz-t (without signal peptide) coding sequence was fused into vector pCAMBIA1300-35S-Myc(C)-rbcsE9, the CatB coding sequence was amplified and fused into vector pCAMBIA1300-35S-Flag(C)-rbcsE9 to generate CatB-Flag. All plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium (GV3101) and expressed in N. benthamiana leaves by co-infiltration. Infiltrated leaves were ground into powder in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail). Supernatants were incubated with anti-GFP/MYC/FLAG beads for 4 h at 4°C and washed 5 times with the extraction buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS loading buffer for 10 min. MYC-IP experiments were performed with the Pierce MYC Tag IP/Co-IP Kit (Thermo, #88842) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The coding sequences of ROD1 and CatB were inserted into pCAMBIA-35S-nLuc and pCAMBIA-35S-cLuc, respectively. The resulting plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101. After culture in LB media overnight at 28°C, the bacteria were collected and resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MES,150 μM acetosyringone, pH 5.6), and incubated for 2∼3 hours at 30°C. The suspensions were infiltrated into leaves of three-week-old N. benthamiana . Luciferase activity was measured with Luciferase Assay Systems (Promega) after 2 days of transformation.
To assess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RIP1 and APIP6, and the ubiquitination of ROD1 by RIP1 and APIP6, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays as previously described ( Park et al., 2012 48. Park, C.H. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Shirsekar, G. ... The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :4748-4762 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ; You et al., 2016 69. You, Q. ∙ Zhai, K. ∙ Yang, D. ... An E3 ubiquitin ligase-BAG protein module controls plant innate immunity and broad-spectrum disease resistance Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :758-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ROD1 coding sequence was inserted into vector pCold™ TF (TaKaRa). APIP6, RIP1 and their mutated forms APIP6 (H58Y) and RIP1(H74Y) were cloned into pMAL-c5X. The fusion constructs were introduced into E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) and grown in LB medium at 37°C to OD600 = 0.5. The recombinant proteins were induced with 0.3 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 20 h at 18°C. Bacterial cells were collected and affinity-purified with Ni-NTA agrose (QIAGEN, for pColdTM TF constructed plasmids) and Amylose Resin (New England Biolabs, for pMAL-c5X constructed plasmids), following manufacturer’s instructions.
For in vitro ubiquitination reactions, 1 μg of MBP-RIP1, MBP-APIP6, MBP-RIP1 H74Y or MBP-APIP6 (H58Y) were incubated with wheat E1 (50 ng), Arabidopsis E2 (UBC10, 200 ng), 1 μg of ubiquitin, and 1.5 μL of 20 × reaction buffer (1 M Tris HCl pH 7.5, 40 mM ATP, 100 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM DTT, 600 mM creatine phosphate, and 1 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase). After incubation at 30°C for 1.5 h, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS loading buffer and heating at 100°C for 5 min. Samples were then separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Ubiquitination signals were detected by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin, anti-MBP, and anti-ROD1 antibodies, respectively.
Rice leaf samples were ground into fine powders in liquid nitrogen. 1 g of each sample was suspended in 2 mL extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at 12, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (CWBIO). The supernatant was used for catalase activity analysis with the Catalase Assay Kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The activity of purified CatB was measured as the absorbance decrease at 240 nm in 50 mM KH 2 PO4 and 20 mM H 2 O 2 and was shown as units/mg ( Weydert and Cullen, 2010 63. Weydert, C.J. ∙ Cullen, J.J. Measurement of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in cultured cells and tissue Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5 :51-66 Crossref Scopus (1042) PubMed Google Scholar ). One unit represents the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of 1 μM H 2 O 2 per minute at 25°C. To assess the effect of ROD1 and AvrPiz-t on CatB activity, various concentrations of purified ROD1 or AvrPiz-t proteins were mixed with CatB for 1 h at 4°C, and catalase activity was then determined.
MST was used to quantify the Ca 2+ binding affinities of ROD1, ROD1 D132N , ROD1 D-quad , and AvrPiz-t as previously reported ( Yang et al., 2019 67. Yang, Z. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Xue, Y. ... Calcium-activated 14-3-3 proteins as a molecular switch in salt stress tolerance Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1199 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, recombinant proteins ROD1-TF, ROD1 D132N -TF, ROD1 D-quad -TF and AvrPiz-t-TF ( ROD1 , ROD1 D132N , ROD1 D-quad and AvrPiz-t were amplified and inserted into the vector pCold™ TF) with His6-tag were purified from E. coli DE3 as described above. A volume of 100 μL (10 μM) purified ROD1, ROD1 D132N , ROD1 D-quad and AvrPiz-t proteins were exchanged into a labeling buffer and labeled by the dye NT-647-NHS (Nano Temper Technologies GMBH, MuÈnchen) at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The labeled protein was displaced by MST buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% (V/V) Tween-20. 16 small micro reaction tubes were labeled from 1 through 16. 20 μL of the highest concentration CaCl 2 (60 μM for ROD1, and 100 mM for ROD1 D132N , ROD1 D-quad and AvrPiz-t) in MST buffer was filled into the first micro reaction tube 1, and 10 μL of MST buffer was filled into the micro reaction tubes 2 to 16. 10 μL of tube 1 was transferred to tube 2 and mix well by pipetting up and down several times. A serial dilution was obtained by repeating 15 times and remove 10 μL from tube number 16 after mixing. A range of concentrations of calcium ion (CaCl 2 ) were diluted serially from 60 μM to 1.831 nM for ROD1 and 100 mM to 3.05 μM for ROD1 D132N , ROD1 D-quad and AvrPiz-t in MST buffer. 10 μL of labeled proteins were mixed with 10 μL of calcium ion (CaCl 2 ) at double the concentration determined before in MST buffer. The samples in tubes 1 to 16 were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, and then loaded into silica capillaries (Polymicro Technologies). Binding reactions were measured using a microscale thermophoresis instrument (Nano Temper Technologies GMBH) at 25°C, 40% MST power and 20% LED power. The KD Fit function of the Nano Temper Analysis Software MO Affinity Analysis (V2.3) was used to fit the curve and calculate the value of the dissociation constant ( K d ).
To test the lipid binding affinities of ROD1 and AvrPiz-t, we performed in vitro lipid-protein binding assay ( Okazaki et al., 2015 47. Okazaki, K. ∙ Miyagishima, S.Y. ∙ Wada, H. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate negatively regulates chloroplast division in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2015; 27 :663-674 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). The coding sequences of ROD1 , ROD1 Ca 2+ binding mutants, and AvrPiz-t were amplified with primers. The fragments were cloned into vector pGEX-4T-3 vector (GE Healthcare), and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Isopropylthio-β-galactoside (0.2 mM) was added to induce the expression of the recombinant proteins. Cells were harvested at 6 hours after induction and suspended in PBS buffer. After sonication, the recombinant ROD1 and AvrPiz-t proteins were purified with GST-tag beads (GE Healthcare).
For lipid-protein binding assay, the lipid strips (P-6001; Echelon Biosciences) were first blocked in PBS-T containing 0.1% v/v Tween-20 and 3% BSA for one hour at room temperature (RT). Purified ROD1-GST, ROD1 D-trip -GST, and AvrPiz-t proteins (1.0 μg/mL) were incubated with the lipid strip membranes for two hours at room temperature with gentle agitation. After washing in PBST for five times, the membranes were then incubated with an anti-GST antibody for two hours at room temperature. The hybridization signals were detected using the ECL systems and images were captured using the Tanon-5200 Chemiluminescent imaging system (Tanon).
We used the N. benthamiana cell death assay to determine the functions of ROD1 and catalase in suppressing the hypersensitive response induced by MLA10 ( Bai et al., 2012 1. Bai, S. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Chang, C. ... Structure-function analysis of barley NLR immune receptor MLA10 reveals its cell compartment specific activity in cell death and disease resistance PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002752 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). The coding sequences of ROD1, CatB, and MLA10 were amplified using gene specific primers, and cloned into the vectors pCAMBIA1300-35S-eGFP(C)-rbcsE9, pCAMBIA1305-Flag and pCAMBIA1300-35S-HA(C)-rbcsE9, respectively. The resulting constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. After culture in LB medium overnight at 28°C, the concentrations of GV3101 carrying various constructs were adjusted to OD600 = 1.0, and mixed with a GV3101 strain that expresses p19. The Agrobacteria suspensions were kept at RT for three hours without shaking, and then infiltrated into the leaves of three-week-old N. benthamiana plants. Infiltrated leaves were collected at 36 hpi after transformation, and the expression of each protein was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP, anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibody, respectively. ROS accumulation was detected at 36 hpi by DAB staining. Cell death on infiltrated leaves was photographed at 48 hpi, and quantified by measuring the relative gray area.
Accumulation of H 2 O 2 was detected by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining as described previously ( Yin et al., 2018 68. Yin, X. ∙ Zou, B. ∙ Hong, X. ... Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance Plant Biotechnol. J. 2018; 16 :1476-1487 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Leaf tissues were cut into small pieces (∼1cm in length) and vacuum-infiltrated in DAB solution [1mg/mL DAB, 10 mM MES, pH 3.8 with 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20] for 5 min. After further incubation at 25°C for 8 h, samples were cleared by boiling in 96% ethanol for 10 min. The cleared samples were mounted in 50% glycerol for imaging.
We used in situ hybridization to examine gene expression patterns in rice tissues. cDNA fragments from each gene were amplified and ligated into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega). The insertion orientation of each fragment was verified by sequencing. The constructs were used as templates for PCR with T7 and SP6 primers. The PCR products were purified and used for in vitro transcription with the DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche). Shoot apices and leaves of rice wild-type TP309 plants were fixed in FAA (3.7% formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid, 50% ethanol), embedded in wax and cut into 8-μm sections. The slices were treated, as described previously ( Yang et al., 2017 66. Yang, W. ∙ Wightman, R. ∙ Meyerowitz, E.M. Cell cycle control by nuclear sequestration of CDC20 and CDH1 mRNA in plant stem cells Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :1108-1119.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), in Histoclear II (National Diagnostics, HS-202) for 2 times with each treatment 10 min, and were further treated in EtOH for 2 times with 2 min each. The tissue sections were then treated in the following buffers: 95% EtOH, 1 min; 90% EtOH, 1 min; 80% EtOH, 1 min; 60% EtOH/0.75% NaCl, 1 min; 30% EtOH/0.75% NaCl, 1 min; 0.75% NaCl, 2 min; PBS, 2 min; Proteinase K (19.2 mg/ml), 37°C, 30 min; glycine (2mg/ml in PBS), 2 min; FAA, 5 min; PBS, 2 times, 5 min each. For dehydration, the samples were treated in the following buffers: 0.75% NaCl, 2 min; 30% EtOH/0.75% NaCl, 30 s; 60% EtOH/0.75% NaCl, 30 s; 80% EtOH, 30 s; 90% EtOH, 30 s; 95% EtOH, 30 s; 100% EtOH, 1 min; 100% EtOH fresh, 1 min. The sections were then hybridized with gene-specific probes at 55°C overnight, and incubated with an anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche) for two hours at RT. The hybridization signals were detected by the color reaction using NBT/BCIP (Roche).
For quantification of gene expression, total RNAs were extracted from different tissues using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). 2 μg RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo (dT) primer and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were used as templates for PCR with gene-specific primers ( Table S3 ). Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and gene-specific primers ( Table S3 ). All experiments were repeated three times independently.
RNA-seq was performed by BGI (Shenzhen, China). Raw data (raw reads) were processed by NGS QC Toolkit_v2.3.340 and mapped to the Nipponbare reference genome. The read counts of each gene were obtained by htseq-count-0.7.243. DESeq functions were used to identify the differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 1.5). Three biological replicates of different plants were used for RNA seq analysis. The whole sequencing data were deposited in a public data source.
Rice plants grown in the paddy field were used for SA and JA measurement as previously described ( You et al., 2016 69. You, Q. ∙ Zhai, K. ∙ Yang, D. ... An E3 ubiquitin ligase-BAG protein module controls plant innate immunity and broad-spectrum disease resistance Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :758-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total JA and SA were extracted from the second leaves of 45-day-old plants. SA was analyzed using an HP1100 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with o -anisic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) as the internal standard. JA was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with the labeled D3-JA as an internal standard. All experiments were performed with three biological repeats.
Quantification of H 2 O 2 was performed using an Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit (Molecular Probes), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into fine powders. 100 mg of each sample was fully suspended in 1 mL H 2 O 2 extraction buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5). The extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was used for the quantitative assay. The concentration of H 2 O 2 was shown as μM/g fresh weight.
ROS measurement with luminol-based approach was performed as previously described ( Park et al., 2012 48. Park, C.H. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Shirsekar, G. ... The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :4748-4762 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. Briefly, leaf sheaths from 10-day-old rice plants cultivated on 1/2 MS medium were collected (approximately 3 mm strips) and floated on sterilized water overnight for recovery. The leaf sheaths were then treated with 1 μM flg22 or water in reaction buffer containing 20 μM of luminol (Wako) and 10 μg/mL of horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Luminescence was monitored immediately after the treatment, and continuously measured at 1-min intervals for 100 minutes with Varioskan Flash multireader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The subcellular localization of ROD1, ROD1 mutants, was analyzed in rice protoplasts prepared from leaf sheaths of 10-day-old TP309 seedlings. The coding regions of ROD1 and the mutated forms were amplified using primers pA7-ROD1-F and pA7-ROD1-R ( Table S3 ). All fragments were inserted into pA7-YFP, and transformed into rice protoplasts. Expression of fusion proteins was examined under confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510 and Leica TCS SP8).
The structures of AvrPiz-t and the C2B domain of vesicle exocytosis protein Munc13 were retrieved from the reported Protein Data Bank database under the PDB numbers 2LW6 and 6NYT, respectively. 6NYT was used as a template for modeling the topologies of ROD1 and its core C2 domain. Homology modeling was performed using the Swiss model online service program ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive#structure ). All PDB data were visualized and processed in the PyMol Molecular Graphics System (version 2.0; Schrödinger).
Protein sequences of ROD1-like C2 domain proteins were retrieved from Phytozome ( https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html ). The amino acid sequence of ROD1 was used as a query to search the proteome database of 64 plant species listed in Phytozome 12.1 using the BLASTP program with an Expect (E) threshold of ‘-1’. Multiple sequence alignments of protein were done in Clustal X (1.83). A phylogenetic tree of aligned sequence was constructed in MEGA7 using the Maximum Likelihood method.
The complete list of high-quality SNPs (produced by the 3K Rice Genomes Project ( Wang et al., 2018 60. Wang, W. ∙ Mauleon, R. ∙ Hu, Z. ... Genomic variation in 3,010 diverse accessions of Asian cultivated rice Nature. 2018; 557 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ) within the ROD1 gene ( Os06 g0128800 ) and its surrounding regions (with 50 Kb flanking sequence on both sides) was retrieved from the Rice SNP-Seek Database ( https://snp-seek.irri.org ). The retrieved list of SNPs was further compared with the rice reference genome gene table from RPAN ( https://cgm.sjtu.edu.cn/3kricedb/gene-table.php ) to obtain the gene-specific SNP list for each enclosed genes and converted it into the VCF format. In the case of overlapping genes, we selected the leftmost one to represent the corresponding locus. For each gene locus, the nucleotide diversity (Pi) and Tajima’s D statistics were calculated using VCFtools v.0.1.17 for both the overall rice population (denoted as “all”) and each rice subpopulations (defined by the 3K Rice Genomes Project, Wang et al., 2018 60. Wang, W. ∙ Mauleon, R. ∙ Hu, Z. ... Genomic variation in 3,010 diverse accessions of Asian cultivated rice Nature. 2018; 557 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Quantification analysis on lesion areas, pathogen growth, CatB activity, H 2 O 2 accumulation, grain production and other measurements were conducted in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and PASW Statistics 18 software. All values are presented with mean ± SD. Exact values of n are indicated in the figures or the legends. Significance of difference was examined by Student’s t test and Duncan’s new multiple range test. Detailed descriptions of quantifications and statistical analyses can be found in the figures, figure legends, or methods section. No methods were used for sample randomization or sample size estimation and no data were excluded from analyses.
