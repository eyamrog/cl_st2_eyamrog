Title: Bacteriophages benefit from mobilizing pathogenicity islands encoding immune systems against competitors


Abstract: Summary

Bacteria encode sophisticated anti-phage systems that are diverse and versatile and display high genetic mobility. How this variability and mobility occurs remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a widespread family of pathogenicity islands, the phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs), carry an impressive arsenal of defense mechanisms, which can be disseminated intra- and inter-generically by helper phages. These defense systems provide broad immunity, blocking not only phage reproduction, but also plasmid and non-cognate PICI transfer. Our results demonstrate that phages can mobilize PICI-encoded immunity systems to use them against other mobile genetic elements, which compete with the phages for the same bacterial hosts. Therefore, despite the cost, mobilization of PICIs may be beneficial for phages, PICIs, and bacteria in nature. Our results suggest that PICIs are important players controlling horizontal gene transfer and that PICIs and phages establish mutualistic interactions that drive bacterial ecology and evolution.

Section: Introduction

The arms race between bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages or phages) is a major driving force of evolution ( Forterre and Prangishvili, 2009 21. Forterre, P. ∙ Prangishvili, D.

Sci. 2009; 1178 :65-77 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because phage attack usually leads to the lysis of the infected bacteria, bacterial genomes encode immune systems, which block phage reproduction upon infection ( Bernheim and Sorek, 2020 6.

Bacteria frequently gain these defense systems through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as they provide a selective advantage ( Houte et al., 2016 26. van Houte, S. ∙ Buckling, A. ∙ Westra, E.R.

Defense islands in bacterial and archaeal genomes and prediction of novel defense systems J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193 :6039-6056 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, they also impose a significant fitness cost upon the host, ultimately limiting the number stably carried by a single bacterium ( Houte et al., 2016 26. van Houte, S. ∙ Buckling, A. ∙ Westra, E.R.

Evolutionary entanglement of mobile genetic elements and host defence systems: guns for hire Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 21 :119-131 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). The concept of the “pan-immune system”, a diverse community reservoir of immune systems that mitigates the protection versus cost trade-off by enabling individual microorganisms to carry few defense mechanisms, has recently been proposed ( Bernheim and Sorek, 2020 6. Bernheim, A. ∙ Sorek, R. The pan-immune system of bacteria: antiviral defence as a community resource Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18 :113-119 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ), though the mechanisms driving immune system exchange remain elusive ( Hussain et al., 2021 29. Hussain, F.A. ∙ Dubert, J. ∙ Elsherbini, J. ...

Interestingly, phages can theoretically mobilize defense mechanisms encoded by phage satellites ( O’Hara et al., 2017 52. O’Hara, B.J. ∙ Barth, Z.K. ∙ McKitterick, A.C. ... A highly specific phage defense system is a conserved feature of the Vibrio cholerae mobilome PLoS Genet. 2017; 13 :e1006838 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rousset et al., 2022 61.

A phage parasite deploys a nicking nuclease effector to inhibit viral host replication Nucleic Acids Res. 2022; gkac002 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ), in plasmids ( Humphrey et al., 2021a 27. Humphrey, S. ∙ Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Quiles-Puchalt, N. ... Bacterial chromosomal mobility via lateral transduction exceeds that of classical mobile genetic elements Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :6509 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), or carried in the chromosome ( Chen et al., 2018 14. Chen, J. ∙ Quiles-Puchalt, N. ∙ Chiang, Y.N. ... Genome hypermobility by lateral transduction Science. 2018; 362 :207-212 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fillol-Salom et al., 2021 20.

Commun. 2021; 12 :6510 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, why have phages evolved to mobilize MGE-encoded defense mechanisms that could subsequently block phage reproduction? We propose that phages could benefit by promoting the dissemination of MGE-encoded defense systems in nature, essentially a pre-emptive strike against unrelated phages and other MGEs with their own anti-phage systems.
The phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs) are attractive candidates for mediating this strategy, because they are small (10–15 kb), highly mobile, and widespread in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria ( Fillol-Salom et al., 2018 17. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Martínez-Rubio, R. ∙ Abdulrahman, R.F. ... Phage-inducible chromosomal islands are ubiquitous within the bacterial universe ISME J. 2018; 12 :2114-2128 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martínez-Rubio et al., 2017 46.

In the absence of a helper phage, PICIs reside passively in the bacterial chromosome owing to the expression of a global repressor that represses most of the PICI genes ( Ubeda et al., 2008 69. Ubeda, C. ∙ Maiques, E. ∙ Barry, P. ... SaPI mutations affecting replication and transfer and enabling autonomous replication in the absence of helper phage Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67 :493-503 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following infection by, or induction of, a helper prophage, a specific phage-encoded protein binds to the PICI repressor, activating the PICI cycle ( Bowring et al., 2017 10.

Cell. 2013; 49 :947-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). This results in PICI excision, replication, and packaging into phage-like particles composed of phage virion proteins ( Tormo et al., 2008 64. Tormo, M.A. ∙ Ferrer, M.D. ∙ Maiques, E. ... Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity island DNA is packaged in particles composed of phage proteins J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190 :2434-2440 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ), which leads to very high frequencies of intra- as well as inter-generic PICI transfer ( Chen et al., 2015 13.

A regulatory cascade controls Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity island activation Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1300-1308 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Because PICIs hijack the phage machinery for their transfer, they interfere with helper phage reproduction by expressing Ppi (phage packaging interference) ( Ram et al., 2012 57. Ram, G. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Kumar, K. ... Staphylococcal pathogenicity island interference with helper phage reproduction is a paradigm of molecular parasitism Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Precisely modulated pathogenicity island interference with late phage gene transcription Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :14536-14541 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ) and/or the genes present in operon I ( Ubeda et al., 2007 68. Ubeda, C. ∙ Maiques, E. ∙ Tormo, M.A. ... SaPI operon I is required for SaPI packaging and is controlled by LexA Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65 :41-50 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, PICIs are rarely discussed as classical bacterial immune systems ( Fillol-Salom et al., 2020 19. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Miguel-Romero, L. ∙ Marina, A. ... Beyond the CRISPR-Cas safeguard: PICI-encoded innate immune systems protect bacteria from bacteriophage predation Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2020; 56 :52-58 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ibarra-Chávez et al., 2022 30. Ibarra-Chávez, R. ∙ Brady, A. ∙ Chen, J. ... Phage-inducible chromosomal islands promote genetic variability by blocking phage reproduction and protecting transductants from phage lysis PLoS Genet. 2022; 18 :e1010146 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), largely because their primary role is assumed to be promoting bacterial adaptability and pathogenicity by carrying and disseminating superantigen and antimicrobial resistance genes ( Novick et al., 2010 51. Novick, R.P. ∙ Christie, G.E. ∙ Penadés, J.R. The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :541-551 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ; Penadés and Christie, 2015 55. Penadés, J.R. ∙ Christie, G.E. The phage-inducible chromosomal islands: a family of highly evolved molecular parasites Annu. Rev. Virol. 2015; 2 :181-201 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, when chromosomally integrated, in the absence of a helper phage, PICIs are thought to not provide any protection to the cells, because the genes responsible for the phage interference ( ppi and operon I) are not expressed. In short, PICIs interfere with helper phages that induce the PICI cycle, presumably to promote PICI transfer at the expense of helper phage reproduction.
Here, we identify known and novel bona fide immune systems in PICIs that are constitutively expressed, conferring protection to the PICI-positive cells independent of the activation of the PICI life cycle by a helper phage. We also demonstrate that helper phages can mobilize these PICI-encoded immune systems against other niche competitors (other MGEs). These results change our understanding of how phages and PICIs interact, moving from a strictly parasitic relationship to one that can also prove mutually beneficial, and also provide direct mechanistic evidence of how bacteria can exchange immune systems (intra- and inter-generically) at high frequencies, explaining in part the high turnover observed in defense systems in natural populations ( Hussain et al., 2021 29. Hussain, F.A. ∙ Dubert, J. ∙ Elsherbini, J. ...

Section: Results

Staphylococcus aureus features the best-characterized members of the PICI family, the S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) ( Lindsay et al., 1998 41. Lindsay, J.A. ∙ Ruzin, A. ∙ Ross, H.F. ... The gene for toxic shock toxin is carried by a family of mobile pathogenicity islands in Staphylococcus aureus Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29 :527-543 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). While analyzing the biology of one SaPI, SaPIpT1028 ( Kwan et al., 2005 37. Kwan, T. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ DuBow, M. ... The complete genomes and proteomes of 27 Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophages Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :5174-5179 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A), we observed that this PICI could block S. aureus infection by multiple phages ( Figure 1 B). Although most of these phages encode Sri, the SaPIpT1028 inducer ( Tormo-Más et al., 2010 65. Tormo-Más, M.A. ∙ Mir, I. ∙ Shrestha, A. ... Moonlighting bacteriophage proteins derepress staphylococcal pathogenicity islands Nature. 2010; 465 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ), phages φ2339 and φ96 do not, suggesting that the observed interference against these phages occurred independently of SaPIpT1028 cycle activation. To test this, we constructed plasmid pJP2384, which carries the SaPIpT1028 regulatory region containing the intergenic region between the two regulatory genes, stl and str, plus xis (which is adjacent to str) , fused to a β-lactamase reporter gene ( Figure S1 A). In the absence of a helper phage, β-lactamase expression is blocked by the master SaPI repressor Stl; after infection with a helper phage, binding of the phage-encoded SaPI inducer to Stl derepresses the system, activating β-lactamase expression ( Tormo-Más et al., 2010 65. Tormo-Más, M.A. ∙ Mir, I. ∙ Shrestha, A. ... Moonlighting bacteriophage proteins derepress staphylococcal pathogenicity islands Nature. 2010; 465 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, although all the phages encoding sri increased expression of the reporter, φ2339 and φ96 did not, confirming that these phages do not induce SaPIpT1028 ( Figure S1 B).
Next, we identified the SaPIpT1028 gene(s) responsible for this interference. In SaPIs, the accessory genes (mainly toxins), whose expression are not required for the SaPI reproductive cycle, are located either at the 5′ or 3′ ends of the islands ( Novick et al., 2010 51. Novick, R.P. ∙ Christie, G.E. ∙ Penadés, J.R. The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :541-551 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). SaPIpT1028 ORF5 seemed an appropriate candidate because it is present at the 5′ end of the island ( Figure 1 A) and encodes a protein harboring a MazF domain that is normally present in type II toxin-antitoxin ribonucleases, implicated in various cellular processes, including phage defense ( Alawneh et al., 2016 2. Alawneh, A.M. ∙ Qi, D. ∙ Yonesaki, T. ... An ADP-ribosyltransferase Alt of bacteriophage T4 negatively regulates the Escherichia coli MazF toxin of a toxin–antitoxin module Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 99 :188-198 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aligning the protein sequence of ORF5 with several MazF genes from MazEF systems, we identified two residues (H75, S97) corresponding to established MazF catalytic residues ( Figure S1 C). We cloned ORF5 into the expression plasmid pCN51, introduced the plasmid into the non-lysogenic S. aureus strain RN4220, and tested the ability of phage φ2339 to infect this strain. As shown in Figure 1 C, SaPIpT1028 ORF5 expression blocked phage reproduction. Conversely, expression of the ORF5 H75A or ORF5 S97A mutants from derivative plasmids did not disrupt phage reproduction ( Figure S1 D), showing that ORF5 is necessary and sufficient to block φ2339 reproduction, and suggesting that SaPIpT1028 ORF5 is a ribonuclease similar to MazF. Our results represent the discovery of a new anti-phage system that we have named SMA (single-protein MazF-like antiphage system), whose expression is not linked to the induction of the SaPI cycle.
SaPIpT1028 can block multiple phages ( Figure 1 B). However, because SaPIpT1028 also encodes classical SaPI-mediated interference mechanisms, whose expression requires activation of the SaPI cycle ( ppi and operon I; Figure 1 A), we wanted to know whether the observed interference was mediated by SMA and/or by the canonical SaPI hijacking mechanisms. Accordingly, we generated two strains, one carrying the catalytic Sma S97A mutation ( Figure S1 D), and the other carrying a SaPIpT1028 “mini-island” (mini-SaPIpT1028) in which all the SaPI genes except stl , int , and sma were deleted ( Figure 1 A). This mini island maintains the genetic structure for sma in SaPIpT1028, allowing us to measure only Sma activity in its natural context without the interference of the other systems. Next, our phage collection was used to infect the strains carrying either SaPIpT1028, mini-SaPIpT1028, or SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A . As expected, phages φ2339 and φ96 were blocked by those islands that expressed Sma (SaPIpT1028 and mini-island), but not by SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A , confirming that SMA is solely responsible for blocking these phages ( Figure 1 B).
Excepting the only lytic phage, φSA2, none of the tested phages were completely insensitive to SaPIpT1028 ( Figure 1 B). Whereas most of the interference observed in the phages that induced the island was dependent on SaPI activation (as evidenced using SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A ), Sma expression (mini-SaPIpT1028) was also able to interfere (to a lesser extent) with the reproduction of these phages ( Figures 1 B, S2 , and S3 ). Interestingly, one phage, ROSA, induces the island (strongly affected in the presence of the SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A island) but was also severely blocked by the expression of the SaPIpT1028 Sma ( Figure 1 and S2 ). Comparison of the growth curves of the strains carrying the different versions of SaPIpT1028, as well as the non-lysogenic RN4220 strain, showed that Sma expression did not affect cell growth ( Figure S1 E), confirming that the broad activity of Sma is not caused by general cellular toxicity.
Our results confirm that SaPIpT1028 encodes an ancillary anti-phage system able to interfere with many different phages. Unlike MazEF systems, however, Sma has no nearby antitoxin and is sufficient to provide protection when expressed from a plasmid.
Because almost all S. aureus strains are lysogenic ( Humphrey et al., 2021b 28. Humphrey, S. ∙ San Millán, Á. ∙ Toll-Riera, M. ... Staphylococcal phages and pathogenicity islands drive plasmid evolution Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :5845 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is likely that the SaPIpT1028-positive strains also carry one or more prophages. We tested whether SaPIpT1028 Sma would also block the formation of infective particles upon prophage induction. First, we lysogenized the strains carrying either the wild-type (wt) SaPIpT1028 or the SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A mutant island with phages φ2339 or φ96. Next, we induced these prophages with mitomycin C (MC) and quantified the phage particles generated. SaPIpT1028 dramatically reduced the amount of phage particles produced after prophage induction, an effect that was abrogated with the mutant SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A variant ( Figure 2 A).
Manual searches for the presence of additional anti-phage systems on known SaPIs (localized either in the 5′ or 3′ regions of the islands) yielded several candidates, including: Sma homologs ( Figure S4 ), usually at the 5′ end of the island; the abortive infection system AbiF ( Garvey et al., 1995 22. Garvey, P. ∙ Fitzgerald, G.F. ∙ Hill, C. Cloning and DNA sequence analysis of two abortive infection phage resistance determinants from the lactococcal plasmid pNP40 Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61 :4321-4328 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ) in SaPI4 and SaPI5; and a RexAB-like system, typically found in prophages ( Parma et al., 1992 54. Parma, D.H. ∙ Snyder, M. ∙ Sobolevski, S. ... The Rex system of bacteriophage lambda: tolerance and altruistic cell death Genes Dev. 1992; 6 :497-510 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), present in a SaPI from ST121 strain C ( Figure S4 ). Interestingly, SaPI5 encodes both virulence genes (toxins) and defense systems, which represents the discovery of hybrid resistance and pathogenicity islands.
Many SaPI accessory genes are of unknown function ( Novick et al., 2010 51. Novick, R.P. ∙ Christie, G.E. ∙ Penadés, J.R. The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :541-551 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ; Penadés and Christie, 2015 55. Penadés, J.R. ∙ Christie, G.E. The phage-inducible chromosomal islands: a family of highly evolved molecular parasites Annu. Rev. Virol. 2015; 2 :181-201 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it is tempting to speculate that some of these might represent novel anti-phage defense systems. To test this, we identified a putative system at the 3′ end of an island present in Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain SS413 that contains two uncharacterized genes, one with a Cthe_2314 HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain ( Anantharaman et al., 2013 3. Anantharaman, V. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Burroughs, A.M. ... Comprehensive analysis of the HEPN superfamily: identification of novel roles in intra-genomic conflicts, defense, pathogenesis and RNA processing Biol. Direct. 2013; 8 :15 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ) and one hypothetical gene containing a single predicted transmembrane domain (referred to as HEPN-TM) ( Figure 1 A). These genes were expressed on a plasmid in S. aureus and assayed for anti-phage activity. Indeed, they provided protection against three of the phages tested ( Figure 1 D), making HEPN-TM a prototypical member of a new anti-phage system.
We hypothesized that gram-negative PICIs may also act as reservoirs for immune systems, and so we manually scrutinized PICIs from different species for the presence of immune systems in their flanking regions. Our preliminary analysis identified 19 putative immune systems in K. pneumoniae, E. fergusonii , and E. coli PICIs ( Figure S4 and Table S1 ). Interestingly, K. pneumoniae strain FDAARGOS_1313 simultaneously harbored two different PICIs, each encoding different immune systems ( Figure S5 A). We classified these systems as (1) known defense systems, which encode proteins with established roles in phage interference, or (2) uncharacterized systems. Immune systems previously characterized include retrons, proteins carrying Sirtuin (SIR2) domains, DNA-processing chain A proteins (DprA), and Abi systems ( Bernheim and Sorek, 2020 6. Bernheim, A. ∙ Sorek, R. The pan-immune system of bacteria: antiviral defence as a community resource Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18 :113-119 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rousset et al., 2022 61. Rousset, F. ∙ Depardieu, F. ∙ Miele, S. ... Phages and their satellites encode hotspots of antiviral systems Cell Host Microbe. 2022; 30 :740-753.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the putative novel systems, chosen based on their 3′ localization ( Figure S4 ), we identified hypothetical proteins containing domains not previously involved in phage interference, such as SDH_sah (serine dehydrogenase proteinase), DUF3307, and GIY-YIG nuclease.
To test their activity, we cloned 12 putative immune systems from PICIs present in different species, including 5 uncharacterized systems, under the control of their native promoters, and tested their anti-phage activity using a collection of E. coli , S. enterica , and K. pneumoniae phages ( Table S2 ). In support of the idea that PICIs carry an arsenal of immune systems located in specific hotspots on the PICI genomes, 11 out of the 12 identified systems provided resistance against at least one phage. Importantly, most of these systems offered protection against unrelated phages, from different families, that infect different bacterial species ( Figure 3 ). In addition to the broad defense spectrum seen in some systems, several PICIs carry more than one anti-phage system ( Figure S5 B), broadening their interference spectrum.
Most of the PICI-encoded anti-phage systems were able to block infection by unrelated phages, so we investigated how this is achieved. We evolved two unrelated phages (T7 and HK578) against the two retron systems. Different evolved phages, insensitive to these systems, were obtained and sequenced. Although the retrons were different in sequence ( Figure S6 A) and belonged to different families ( Millman et al., 2020 49. Millman, A. ∙ Bernheim, A. ∙ Stokar-Avihail, A. ... Bacterial retrons function in anti-phage defense Cell. 2020; 183 :1551-1561.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ), they selected for evolved phages carrying mutations in the single-strand DNA-binding ( ssb ) gene ( Figure S6 ). Because T7 and HK578 Ssb proteins show low sequence similarity (20.3% amino acid identity), these results suggest that the PICI-encoded immune systems have the ability to interact with or sense proteins, present in different phages, that perform the same function in the phage life cycle. Whether this interaction blocks the function of the targeted proteins or is just used to activate anti-phage system activity remains to be determined. In any case, this strategy allows PICIs to block unrelated phages because these phages encode these essential proteins for their reproduction ( Lee et al., 1998 38.

To test whether the gram-negative PICI-encoded systems also block the formation of infective particles after prophage induction, we introduced plasmids expressing PICI-encoded defense mechanisms that blocked phage infection into lysogenic host strains carrying the λ, HK97 ( E. coli ), or P22 ( S. enterica ) prophages. The prophages were MC induced and the phages present in the lysates quantified after lysis. For most of the phages, the systems that blocked phage infection also blocked the formation of phage particles after MC induction ( Figures 2 B–2D). The exception was AVAST (antiviral ATPases/NTPases of the STAND [signal transduction ATPases with numerous associated domains] superfamily) type 5-like (SIR2 + STAND) system with the E. coli phages that provides resistance against phage infection, but not prophage induction. Our results report the discovery of an arsenal of PICI-encoded anti-phage systems that can block both life cycle stages of temperate phages.
We next tested whether PICIs could also block the transfer of other PICIs. First, we obtained lysates containing only the E. coli PICIs EcCICFT073 or EcCIEDL933, then used these lysates to infect different E. coli strains expressing different PICI-encoded immune systems and analyzed PICI transfer. Importantly, 4 of the 12 systems tested significantly blocked PICI transfer ( Figures 4 A and S7 A). Because no defense systems against PICIs have previously been described, our results reveal a new layer of ecological competition between PICIs.
It was recently reported in Vibrio cholerae that some ICEs encode immune systems that block phage infection and transfer of phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements (PLEs) ( LeGault et al., 2021 39. LeGault, K.N. ∙ Hays, S.G. ∙ Angermeyer, A. ... Temporal shifts in antibiotic resistance elements govern phage-pathogen conflicts Science. 2021; 373 :eabg2166 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, one of the conjugative plasmids used here (pED208) encodes an uncharacterized anti-phage system ( Figure S7 B). Although PLEs and PICIs are unrelated in sequence and structure, both exploit their cognate helper phages for induction and dissemination ( McKitterick et al., 2019 48. McKitterick, A.C. ∙ Hays, S.G. ∙ Johura, F.-T. ... Viral satellites exploit phage proteins to escape degradation of the bacterial host chromosome Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 26 :504-514.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; McKitterick and Seed, 2018 47. McKitterick, A.C. ∙ Seed, K.D. Anti-phage islands force their target phage to directly mediate island excision and spread Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2348 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Penadés and Christie, 2015 55. Penadés, J.R. ∙ Christie, G.E. The phage-inducible chromosomal islands: a family of highly evolved molecular parasites Annu. Rev. Virol. 2015; 2 :181-201 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we hypothesized that both phages and PICIs could benefit from the mobility of the PICIs if these elements blocked conjugation of plasmids carrying anti-phage or anti-PICI systems. To test this, we analyzed the transfer of the conjugative plasmids pOX38 and pED208 into the E. coli strains expressing the immune systems that also blocked PICI transfer. These immune systems were selected because they already showed activity against different MGEs, suggesting they might have broad activity.
We found that two of the systems (abortive infection C-terminus [Abi_C]-like and HsdR-like) that affected PICI transfer also significantly blocked conjugation ( Figures 4 B and S7 C). Although the Abi_C-like system present in KpCIFDAARGOS_1313 targeted both plasmids, the HsdR-like system present in KpCIC51 only targeted plasmid pOX38. Our results confirm that the PICI-encoded immune systems have a broad spectrum of activity, likely targeting conserved pathways employed by different MGEs (phages, PICIs, and conjugative plasmids). Therefore, our results highlight a new role for the PICIs in bacterial evolution by limiting HGT in nature.
Having shown that PICI-encoded immune systems block the transfer of other MGEs, we tested their ability to block the transfer of chromosomal genes via generalized transduction (GT) ( Zinder and Lederberg, 1952 73. Zinder, N.D. ∙ Lederberg, J. Genetic exchange in Salmonella J. Bacteriol. 1952; 64 :679-699 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ) or lateral transduction (LT) ( Chen et al., 2018 14. Chen, J. ∙ Quiles-Puchalt, N. ∙ Chiang, Y.N. ... Genome hypermobility by lateral transduction Science. 2018; 362 :207-212 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fillol-Salom et al., 2021 20. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Bacigalupe, R. ∙ Humphrey, S. ... Lateral transduction is inherent to the life cycle of the archetypical Salmonella phage P22 Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :6510 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, we analyzed whether the presence of the different systems impacted the generation of transducing particles after induction of S. enterica P22 (by LT) or S. aureus φ2339 (by GT or LT) prophages. Consistent with the inhibition of phage particle generation by the respective anti-phage systems ( Figures 2 A and 2C), the production of transducing particles (generated either by GT or LT) was severely reduced by the presence of the immune systems in the donor cells ( Figure 4 C and S8 A–S8C).
To analyze the outcomes of defense systems being mobilized by PICIs, we first confirmed that the PICIs carrying immune systems are indeed mobile. To this end, we started with SaPIpT1028 or SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A positive strains also containing phages 80α or φNM2, which induce SaPIpT1028. These strains were MC induced, and the transfer of the islands analyzed. Both phages were able to promote the high transfer of the islands, at the expense of reducing their titers ( Figures 5 A and 5B and S8 D–S8E). We then tested that SaPIpT1028 is still functional after mobilization. Importantly, though the recipient RN4220 alone was sensitive to phage infection, the RN4220 derivative strains that had acquired either wt Sma or the Sma S97A mutant (via SaPIpT1028) showed a profile of phage resistance ( Figure 5 C) identical to that represented in Figure 1 B, confirming that SaPIpT1028 can be mobilized to provide phage resistance in naive strains.
Next, we investigated if the mobilization of SaPIpT1028 by a helper phage can subsequently benefit the helper phage. We infected RN4220 cells with lysates containing either only 80α, 80α with SaPIpT1028, or 80α with SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A at a phage multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 ( Figure 5 D). The recovering cells all contained the 80α prophage, owing to the survival of these cells from 80α lysogenization and superinfection exclusion ( Figure S9 B), and approximately half the cells also contained SaPIpT1028 or SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A , where relevant ( Figure S9 A). This demonstrates that the helper phage can co-localize with its cognate SaPI in recipient cells after infection with a lysate containing both types of infective particles.
We then assessed whether the co-transfer of 80α and SaPIpT1028 results in protection of the concomitant 80α lysogen, as outlined in Figure 5 D. We first picked colonies after the infection that were either 80α lysogens alone or 80α lysogens with either SaPIpT1028 or SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A . We challenged these with φ2339 E , a φ2339 variant that is able to infect 80α lysogens. Whereas the 80α lysogens were sensitive to φ2339 E infection, 80α lysogens with SaPIpT1028 were protected in an Sma-dependent manner ( Figure 5 E). Next, we sought to test the immunity of the bulk populations resulting from the initial infections. In contrast to the populations resulting from 80α infection alone, or the populations from the 80α+SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A infection, the populations resulting from 80α+SaPIpT1028 infection were protected from φ2339 E infection in a liquid growth assay ( Figure 5 F). This was despite only about half the 80α lysogens also containing SaPIpT1028 ( Figure S9 A). Overall, these results demonstrate that although initial 80α titers are lower in the presence of SaPIpT1028, SaPIpT1028 “travels” with 80α and can provide anti-phage immunity against phages infecting 80α lysogens, protecting both the 80α prophage and the bacterial host from phage predation.
SaPIpT1028 was originally isolated from S. aureus strain NY940 ( Kwan et al., 2005 37. Kwan, T. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ DuBow, M. ... The complete genomes and proteomes of 27 Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophages Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :5174-5179 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). We sequenced this strain and identified one prophage, which we named Sushi. In the presence of SaPIpT1028, the Sushi phage titer is reduced upon MC induction, but the resulting lysates contain about 10-fold more SaPIpT1028 particles than Sushi particles ( Figures S8 F–S8G), showing that Sushi is naturally highly efficient at mobilizing SaPIpT1028. To investigate whether the aforementioned scenario with 80α+SaPIpT1028 transfer could also occur for Sushi, we infected RN4220 with lysates containing Sushi, Sushi+SaPIpT1028, or Sushi+SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A , at a phage MOI of 1, and analyzed the resultant lysogen populations. As with 80α, practically all the recipient cells harbored the Sushi prophage ( Figure S9 D), while the proportion of cells containing SaPIpT1028 was nearly 100% ( Figure S9 C). These results show that in its natural context, SaPIpT1028 is efficiently mobilized by its cognate helper phage, and resulting lysogens are likely to contain Sushi as well as the protecting SaPIpT1028.
We wanted to test a similar ecological scenario with the HEPN-TM system present in S. saprophyticus , which protects cells against infection by the lytic phage φSA2 ( Figure 1 D). As above with 80α and Sushi, when SaPIs are mobilized, it is likely that the SaPI-positive surviving recipient cells also become lysogenic for the helper phage. We used lysogenic cells containing phage 80α as recipients, carrying the PICI-encoded HEPN-TM system on a plasmid (because we do not have access to the S. saprophyticus PICI). These lysogenic cells were then infected with the lytic phage φSA2 at different MOIs (0.01 or 5) with an empty plasmid as a control, and the survival of the population was measured over time. After phage infection, in the absence of the defense system, the lysogenic cells lysed (pCN57), while the titers of the lytic phage significantly increased ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Therefore, in the absence of HEPN-TM system, the lysogen population harboring prophage 80α was eliminated. By contrast, the presence of the defense system promoted the survival of the 80α prophage by blocking φSA2 reproduction ( Figure 6 ), demonstrating that a PICI-encoded system can protect prophages in the same cell from lytic phage predation.
Next, we extended the strategy to investigate gram-negative PICIs encoding immune systems and their helper phages. Because we do not have the PICI encoding the GIY-YIG endonuclease protein, we engineered our prototypical E. coli PICI, EcCICFT073, which is mobilized by phage 80 ( Fillol-Salom et al., 2019 18. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Bacarizo, J. ∙ Alqasmi, M. ... Hijacking the hijackers: Escherichia coli pathogenicity islands redirect helper phage packaging for their own benefit Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :1020-1030.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), and inserted this gene at the 3′ end of the PICI. We then confirmed that phage 80 mobilized this chimeric PICI ( Figure S9 E). As with S. aureus , we infected E. coli recipient cells with either a lysate containing phage 80 or containing phage 80 plus the chimeric PICI. Next, we tested the viability of the different populations after infection with the E. coli phage HK97, which is insensitive to phage 80. Our results, summarized in Figure 6 C, confirm that the mobilization of the chimeric EcCICFT073 protects phage 80 against the lytic attack of phage HK97.
The use of the E. coli systems allowed us to analyze an additional scenario: instead of being mobilized to a non-lysogenic strain, helper phages and PICIs could integrate into a strain already carrying a prophage. After induction, the presence of the PICI-encoded immune systems would target the original prophage but not the helper phage ( Figure 6 D). To test this, we used the 80 or the 80/chimeric PICI lysates to infect the lysogenic strain carrying HK97. Next, we MC induced the lysogenic strains for phage 80 and HK97, with or without the chimeric EcCICFT073, and the phages present in the different lysates were quantified. In absence of the PICI, the phage HK97 progeny is slightly higher than phage 80. However, in presence of the PICI, the HK97 titer is reduced 10 3 -fold while helper phage 80 is unaffected ( Figure 6 E).
Taken together, our results represent the discovery of a new interaction between phages and their satellites; namely, that some phages can benefit from the mobilization of PICIs containing anti-phage systems that target rival phages, protecting both the phage and the bacterial host.
PICIs can be mobilized intra- and inter-generically ( Chen and Novick, 2009 12. Chen, J. ∙ Novick, R.P. Phage-mediated intergeneric transfer of toxin genes Science. 2009; 323 :139-141 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2015 13. Chen, J. ∙ Carpena, N. ∙ Quiles-Puchalt, N. ... Intra- and inter-generic transfer of pathogenicity island-encoded virulence genes by cos phages ISME J. 2015; 9 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maiques et al., 2007 42. Maiques, E. ∙ Ubeda, C. ∙ Tormo, M.A. ... Role of staphylococcal phage and SaPI integrase in intra- and interspecies SaPI transfer J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :5608-5616 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we tested whether SaPIpT1028 can be mobilized to other species. Indeed, we observed SaPIpT1028 mobilization into S. xylosus C2a and two L. monocytogenes strains ( Figures S9 F–S9G), confirming that PICIs can shuttle anti-phage genes across inter-species and inter-generic barriers.
Importantly, the fact that many of the gram-negative anti-phage systems tested conferred protection against phages infecting several species ( Figure 3 ) opened the possibility that PICIs could spread these anti-MGE defense systems to new bacterial species, where their carriage would protect the new PICI-positive strains against phage predation. In support of this idea, we identified a PICI that was present in both E. coli and K. pneumoniae ( Figure S5 C) and another PICI that was present in E. fergusonii , K. pneumoniae , and Enterobacter hormaechei ( Figure S5 D), corroborating that these elements can jump between different species and genera. The latter PICI (EfCIRHB19-C05) carried two of the immune systems that were previously characterized, the AVAST type 5-like (SIR2 + STAND) system and HP (hypothetical). Although the HP system only blocked infection by phages HK578 ( E. coli ), and P22 and ES18 ( Salmonella ), the AVAST type 5-like was able to block most of the phages tested in different species ( Figure 3 ), confirming that the expression of this gene in a new species will protect the cells carrying this island from phage attack.

Section: Discussion

HGT is a primary driver of bacterial evolution. Although it is often viewed as a beneficial process that allows bacterial adaptation to changing environments, HGT can often impose fitness costs because of the transfer of incompatible genes, genes with no function, or MGEs that are selfishly replicating, including phages that can kill the recipient cell. To mitigate these detrimental effects, bacteria have evolved multiple defense mechanisms that limit phage infection and/or gene transfer. Recent studies have dramatically expanded the number and diversity of known bacterial immune systems ( Doron et al., 2018 16. Doron, S. ∙ Melamed, S. ∙ Ofir, G. ...

Vassallo, C. ∙ Doering, C. ∙ Littlehale, M.L. ... Mapping the landscape of anti-phage defense mechanisms in the E. coli pangenome Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). However, the number of systems that a single bacterium can possess is limited because their carriage is costly to the host bacterium. This poses a challenge to bacteria facing a wide diversity of phages and other MGEs. To circumvent this, even closely related bacteria often carry different defense systems, allowing the overall population to harbor a high diversity of immune systems to be shared with the community. Furthermore, bacterial defense systems are easily gained or lost from the bacterial chromosome and are predicted to have high mobility. However, how this mobility is achieved remains unclear.
Addressing these questions, we show that bacterial immune systems can be located in “hotspots” within PICIs, which are highly mobile genomic islands present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We identify both previously characterized and novel anti-MGE systems that can target phages, conjugative plasmids, and PICIs and can inhibit generalized and lateral transduction. The systems are located in the 5′ and 3′ flanks of PICIs, where other ancillary genes like virulence factors and antibiotic resistance have previously been identified ( Novick et al., 2010 51. Novick, R.P. ∙ Christie, G.E. ∙ Penadés, J.R. The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :541-551 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing protection independently of PICI life cycle activation. We also demonstrate that because of their high mobility, PICIs can transfer bacterial defense systems and provide immunity to naive strains. PICIs are a highly suitable vector for the mobility of defense systems owing to (1) their carriage of an impressive arsenal of accessory genes that promote bacterial persistence in different niches and hosts ( Viana et al., 2010 71. Viana, D. ∙ Blanco, J. ∙ Tormo-Más, M.A. ... Adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus to ruminant and equine hosts involves SaPI-carried variants of von Willebrand factor-binding protein Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77 :1583-1594 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ), (2) extraordinary intra- and inter-generic transfer ( Chen and Novick, 2009 12. Chen, J. ∙ Novick, R.P.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :5608-5616 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ), and (3) multiple integration sites in the bacterial chromosomes ( Fillol-Salom et al., 2018 17. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Martínez-Rubio, R. ∙ Abdulrahman, R.F. ... Phage-inducible chromosomal islands are ubiquitous within the bacterial universe ISME J. 2018; 12 :2114-2128 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martínez-Rubio et al., 2017 46.

Phage-inducible islands in the Gram-positive cocci ISME J. 2017; 11 :1029-1042 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), allowing the simultaneous acquisition of different PICIs encoding defense systems ( Figure S5 A). Moreover, PICI acquisition is reversible, and PICIs can be readily lost in the absence of selection ( Ubeda et al., 2003 67. Ubeda, C. ∙ Tormo, M.A. ∙ Cucarella, C. ... Sip, an integrase protein with excision, circularization and integration activities, defines a new family of mobile Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49 :193-210 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), conforming to the high turnover observed for defense systems in bacteria.
Furthermore, our studies reveal a more nuanced relationship between PICIs and the phages they parasitize. Traditionally, PICIs have been viewed as strict phage parasites, hijacking the helper phage life cycle for their own benefit. Surprisingly, however, this PICI-mediated phage interference was never complete, ranging from no interference to 10 3 -fold reduction in the phage titers ( Quiles-Puchalt et al., 2014 56. Quiles-Puchalt, N. ∙ Carpena, N. ∙ Alonso, J.C. ... Staphylococcal pathogenicity island DNA packaging system involving cos-site packaging and phage-encoded HNH endonucleases Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6016-6021 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show that despite the inhibition and reduced initial titer of the helper phage in the presence of a PICI, the helper phage can benefit from the defense systems carried by the PICI. The helper phage and PICI can “travel” together to a naive host, and the PICI protects the helper phage lysogen from phage predation ( Figures 5 D–5F and S9 A–S9D). Similarly, both elements can travel to a lysogenic strain (containing a non-helper phage), and upon induction, the PICI-carried immune system can specifically target the non-helper phage, giving the helper phage a relative advantage in its niche ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Contrary to being antagonistic, PICIs and phages can establish mutually beneficial interactions allowing them to persist in nature, representing an elegant mechanism where phages are both a target of the PICI-carried system and also vital for PICI mobility. This creates a complex web of cooperation and antagonism, where the PICI, the helper phage, and the bacterium can all benefit from the inhibition of competing MGEs.
Importantly, we also show that PICIs play unexpected roles in controlling the flux of genes in bacterial populations (HGT) through the expression of immune systems that block phage reproduction, PICI transfer, conjugation, and transduction. Though PICIs were classically seen as elements that promote genetic variability by encoding important virulence genes, our results indicate that the presence of these elements may limit the acquisition of new traits, therefore slowing down the emergence of new bacterial clones. Although we do not know how this dual behavior will impact the evolution of natural communities, our results clearly highlight a new role for the PICIs in controlling and/or promoting the emergence of novel bacterial clones.

Although our preliminary analysis suggests that some of the PICI-encoded systems in this study seem to be exclusively found on PICIs, other systems could also be localized in other MGEs. Regardless of whether the PICI encoded immune systems are exclusively present within these elements, their localization in the highly mobile PICIs endow them with unique features compared to those encoded in other MGEs or on the chromosome. The presence of so many bacterial systems within MGEs raises important questions: how are the systems evolutionarily related? Can MGEs exchange immune systems? Can immune systems shuttle between PICIs and bacterial chromosomes (e.g., to chromosomal defense islands)? Why are some systems present in specific MGEs, whereas others seem to be more widespread? The answers to these questions remain elusive ( Rocha and Bikard, 2021 59. Rocha, E.P.C. ∙ Bikard, D. Microbial defenses against mobile genetic elements and viruses: Who defends whom from what? PLoS Biol. 2021; 20 :e3001514 Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar ), but our results have clearly demonstrated that the dynamics and interactions between MGEs are more nuanced than previously appreciated. Moreover, prophages, PICIs, plasmids, and defense islands (which can coexist in a cell) carrying complementary defense systems can work together against the acquisition of additional MGEs ( LeGault et al., 2021 39. LeGault, K.N. ∙ Hays, S.G. ∙ Angermeyer, A. ... Temporal shifts in antibiotic resistance elements govern phage-pathogen conflicts Science. 2021; 373 :eabg2166 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jaskólska et al., 2022 31.

Two defence systems eliminate plasmids from seventh pandemic Vibrio cholerae Nature. 2022; 604 :323-329 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rousset et al., 2022 61.

Phages and their satellites encode hotspots of antiviral systems Cell Host Microbe. 2022; 30 :740-753.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, MGEs can encode both immune systems and virulence or antibiotic resistance genes ( Figure S4 ). Thus, it is of vital importance to comprehend how these MGEs interact to understand the emergence of novel virulent and antibiotic resistant clones. In support of this idea, it has been recently demonstrated that some V. cholerae phages can counteract the interference caused by the presence in the cells of an ICE expressing anti-phage systems, and as a consequence of the productive infection, the phage stimulates high-frequency transfer of the ICE by conjugation, leading to the concurrent dissemination of phage and antibiotic resistances ( LeGault et al., 2021 39. LeGault, K.N. ∙ Hays, S.G. ∙ Angermeyer, A. ... Temporal shifts in antibiotic resistance elements govern phage-pathogen conflicts Science. 2021; 373 :eabg2166 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Once again, their modus operandi demonstrates that PICIs are very sophisticated MGEs with unexpected roles in bacterial pathogenesis and evolution. Their multiple roles and functions, linked to an extraordinary ability to be mobilized intra- and inter-generically, explain why these elements are widespread in nature. Future research will continue to shed light on established and unexpected roles that PICIs play in the microbial world.
Although PICIs are widespread in nature, our study focused on PICIs from S. aureus , E. coli , and K. pneumoniae . This analysis was not exhaustive but demonstrated the presence of different immune systems on PICIs that are active independently of the PICI life cycle. This study underlines that we need to better understand how different MGEs carrying immune systems interact and to further elucidate how these interactions drive bacterial evolution. It is also important that future studies reveal how the immune systems are captured by PICIs, how these immune systems relate to other systems present in other MGEs or in defense islands, and what type of interactions occur among immune systems present in different MGEs. Finally, although our studies show that mutualistic interactions between phages and PICIs can occur, work in more native environments must be performed before we can conclusively state that this type of behavior is common in nature.

Phages and bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Tables S2 and S3 , respectively. S. aureus strains were grown at 37°C or 30°C on Tryptic soy agar (TSA) or in Tryptic soy broth (TSB) with shaking (120 r.p.m.) supplemented with erythromycin (10 μg mL −1 , Sigma-Aldrich), chloramphenicol (10 μg mL −1 , Sigma-Aldrich), or 0.1 mM CdCl 2 as needed. E. coli , Salmonella and K. pneumoniae, strains were grown at 37°C or 30°C on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or in LB broth with shaking (120 r.p.m.). Kanamycin (30 μg mL −1 ), Tetracycline (20 μg mL −1 ), or Chloramphenicol (20 μg mL −1 ) were added when appropriate.
Initially, we performed a search for PICIs present in S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumonia strains from the lab. PICIs were identified based on common features, as previously published ( Fillol-Salom et al., 2018 17. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Martínez-Rubio, R. ∙ Abdulrahman, R.F. ... Phage-inducible chromosomal islands are ubiquitous within the bacterial universe ISME J. 2018; 12 :2114-2128 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martínez-Rubio et al., 2017 46. Martínez-Rubio, R. ∙ Quiles-Puchalt, N. ∙ Martí, M. ... Phage-inducible islands in the Gram-positive cocci ISME J. 2017; 11 :1029-1042 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we searched for PICIs with: (i) conserved gene organization, including an integrase, a replication module, and a regulation module (for gram-positive a repressor and for gram-negative an activator); (ii) size around 10–15 kb; (iii) exclusive attachment ( att ) sites; and (iv) absence of lytic genes. Then, we inspected for known defense systems present on those identified PICIs. In this way, we identified some PICIs that encode known defense systems (such as Abi systems). To identify hotspots, we performed a BLASTN using the whole PICI versus the NCBI database (with standard parameters, E value <0.05). For those positive hits that have a variable region, the identified immune systems were manually analyzed and HHpred was used to identify protein domains involved in interference ( Zimmermann et al., 2018 72. Zimmermann, L. ∙ Stephens, A. ∙ Nam, S.-Z. ... A completely reimplemented MPI bioinformatics toolkit with a new HHpred server at its core J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :2237-2243 Crossref Scopus (1451) PubMed Google Scholar ). For identifying the HEPN-TM system, we performed PSI-BLAST (with standard parameters, E value <0.05) on the integrase of SaPIpT1028 to identify similar SaPIs, and genes at the end of the SaPI were manually analyzed using HHpred (with standard parameters, against the PDB, Pfam, COG, and CD databases).
To compare two proteins, the EMBOSS Needle Pairwise Sequence Alignment was used, using the standard parameters (Matrix: EBLOSUM62, Gap penalty: 10.0 and Extend penalty: 0.5).
To align ORF5 (Sma) with various MazFs from toxin-antitoxin systems, Clustal Omega Multiple Sequence Alignment tool was used, with default parameters. MazF family members that had experimentally validated catalytic residues were included.
Plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Tables S4 and S5 , respectively. The plasmid pBAD18- km R was initially constructed by Gibson assembly method ( Gibson et al., 2009 23. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.-Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (6392) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the oligonucleotides listed in Table S5 . Synthetic genes were purchased from ThermoFisher scientific (GeneArt Gene Synthesis). The plasmids generated in this study ( Table S4 ) were constructed by cloning PCR products, amplified with the oligonucleotides listed in Table S5 from the different synthetic plasmids, into the pBAD18- km R vector using ligation. All generated plasmids that contain immune systems encode their native promoters. The plasmid containing the HEPN-TM system was generated by Gibson assembly, and expression was under the constitutive pCN57 promoter. Plasmids containing sma ( orf005 ) were constructed by PCR amplification from SaPIpT1028 and assembled by Gibson assembly or restriction-ligation. Plasmids were verified by Sanger sequencing in Eurofins Genomics.
For S. aureus , gene deletions were performed as previously described ( Tormo-Más et al., 2013 66. Tormo-Más, M.Á. ∙ Donderis, J. ∙ García-Caballer, M. ... Phage dUTPases control transfer of virulence genes by a proto-oncogenic G protein-like mechanism Mol. Cell. 2013; 49 :947-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the allelic-exchange vector, pBT2-βgal, was used to obtain mutants using the primers as shown in Table S5 . To generate the SaPIpT1028 with erm C (JP19047), plasmid pBT2-Bgal-ermC was used. To generate the mini-island or the SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A mutant, plasmids pAO045 or pJR3 were respectively electroporated into RN4220 carrying SaPIpT1028:: erm C (JP19047). Transformants were plated on TSA plates supplemented with chloramphenicol and erythromycin for the selection of the plasmid and the SaPIpT1028 respectively and incubated at 32°C for selection of the temperature-sensitive plasmid. Through homologous recombination, the plasmids were forced to integrate into the bacterial chromosome at the non-permissive temperature (42°C). Light blue colonies, indicative of plasmid integration, were grown in 7 mL of TSB at 32°C for 24 h. Ten-fold serial dilution of the overnight cultures in sterile TSB was plated on TSA plates containing X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro- 3-indolyl-B-D-galactopyranoside) (80 μg mL −1 ) and incubated at 42°C for 24 h. White colonies indicate the plasmid loss, which was confirmed by screening for chloramphenicol sensitivity. The different mutants obtained were verified by PCR and DNA sequencing.
For E. coli , gene insertions or deletions were performed as previously described ( Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 15. Datsenko, K.A. ∙ Wanner, B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :6640-6645 Crossref Scopus (11855) PubMed Google Scholar ). The chloramphenicol ( cat ) or kanamycin resistance ( km R) makers were amplified by PCR, with primers listed in Table S5 , from plasmid pKD3 or pKD4 and inserted into the PICI or phage genome using λ Red recombinase-mediated recombination. Briefly, the PCR product was transformed into the recipient strain harboring plasmid pRWG99, which expresses the λ Red recombinase, and the markers were inserted into the PICI or phage genome. To remove the chromosomal marker from the phage genome, plasmid pCP20 was transformed into the corresponding strain. The strains harboring the plasmid pCP20 were grown overnight at 30°C, then, a 1:50 dilution (into fresh LB) was prepared and grown for 4 h at 42°C to encourage plasmid loss, while permitting FLP recombination. Strains were plated out on LB-plates and incubated at 37°C. Single colonies were streaked out and PCR was used to corroborate that the chromosomal marker was removed. The different mutants obtained were subsequently verified by PCR and DNA sequencing.
To construct the EcCICFT073 chimera, site-directed scarless mutagenesis was performed as described previously ( Fillol-Salom et al., 2019 18. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Bacarizo, J. ∙ Alqasmi, M. ... Hijacking the hijackers: Escherichia coli pathogenicity islands redirect helper phage packaging for their own benefit Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :1020-1030.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the km R marker together with an I- Sce I recognition restriction site was amplified by PCR, using primers listed in Table S5 , and inserted into the recipient strain harboring plasmid pRWG99, which expresses the λ Red recombinase protein. The km R marker + I- Sce I insertion was verified by PCR, and then a PCR product containing the GIY-YIG endonuclease system was electroporated into the mutant strain expressing the λ Red recombinase-mediated system. Successful recombinants were selected by expression of I- Sce I endonuclease. The different mutants obtained were subsequently verified by PCR and DNA sequencing.
To identify Sushi, NY940 was sent for whole-genome sequencing (MicrobesNG, Birmingham, UK), and the resulting contigs were assembled with MeDuSa ( Bosi et al., 2015 8. Bosi, E. ∙ Donati, B. ∙ Galardini, M. ... MeDuSa: a multi-draft based scaffolder Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :2443-2451 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ) using NCTC8325-4 as a reference genome. This resulted in a 2.7 mb contig (1), as well as eight small contigs of 128–468 bp. PHASTER ( Arndt et al., 2019 4. Arndt, D. ∙ Marcu, A. ∙ Liang, Y. ... PHAST, PHASTER and PHASTEST: Tools for finding prophage in bacterial genomes Brief. Bioinform. 2019; 20 :1560-1567 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to identify putative phages in contig 1, revealing, in addition to SaPIpT1028, a 49.7 kb region containing an unknown phage. In this region, the att sites of S. aureus phage integrase group 5 were identified, resulting in a 43.7 kb phage renamed Sushi. Phage Sushi was deposited in the NCBI database under the accession number ON571632.
For E. coli, Salmonella or Klebsiella pneumoniae , strains carrying either the empty pBAD18- km R plasmid, or pBAD18- km R encoding the different immune systems were grown overnight, then subcultured using a 1:50 dilution (into fresh LB broth) and grown to an OD 600 = 0.34. Bacterial lawns were prepared by mixing 300 μL of cells with phage top agar (PTA) and pouring onto square plates. The same protocol was used for S. aureus , but 1 μM mL −1 of CdCl 2 as added into the plate to induce transcription from the pCN51 promoter. Serial dilutions of phages were prepared in phage buffer (50mM Tris pH 8, 1mM MgSO 4 , 4mM CaCl 2 and 100mM NaCl) and spotted onto the recipient bacterial lawn plates, which were then incubated at 37°C for 24h. The fold change in protection against phage was measured by quantifying the number of plaques on the strain carrying the empty plasmid divided by the number of plaques on the strain carrying the immune system. SP means small plaques.
For E. coli and Salmonella , lysogenic strains carrying the corresponding PICI or plasmid were grown in LB broth to OD 600 = 0.2 and mitomycin C (2 μg mL −1 ) was added for induction of the prophage. The induced cultures were grown at 32°C with slow shaking (80 r.p.m.). For EcCICFT073 and EcCIEDL933, the lysates obtained after induction of these strains only contain PICI particles, since the helper phages used in these experiments are mutants incapable of packaging the phage dsDNA (80 Δ cos N for EcCICFT073 and HK106 Δ ter S for EcCIEDL933). At 6 h post-induction, the induced samples were filtered using sterile 0.2 μm filters (Minisart® single use syringe filter unit, hydrophilic and non-pryogenic, Sartonium Stedim Biotech). The number of phage or PICI particles in the resultant lysate was quantified. A similar protocol was followed for S. aureus prophage inductions, but cultures were left overnight (∼16 h) to account for possible late lysis (due to Sma immunity).
To isolate phage Sushi, NY940 was induced with MC, and serial 10-fold dilutions of lysate were prepared and plated onto a top agar lawn of RN4220. A single plaque was picked, the phage was amplified by infection of RN4220, and the resultant lysate was serially diluted again. Another single plaque was picked, and this was used to produce an RN4220 Sushi lysogen. To confirm that the isolated phage was the same phage observed from the NY940 sequencing, a 1kb region of Sushi was amplified from the lysogen by PCR, and Sanger sequenced.
A 1:50 dilution (in fresh broth medium: LB for E. coli, and TSB for S. aureus ) of an overnight recipient strain carrying the empty plasmid or plasmids with the immune systems was grown to OD 0.34 (OD 600 for E. coli , OD 540 for S. aureus ). Then, 50 μL of recipient cells were mixed with 100 μL of phage lysate diluted in phage buffer, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The infection mixture was plated out on phage base agar plates (PBA; 25 g of Nutrient Broth No. 2, Oxoid; 7g agar) supplemented with CaCl 2 to a final concentration of 5 mM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24h. The number of plaques formed (indicative of phage particles present in the lysate) were counted and represented as plaque forming units (PFU/mL). For titering E. coli mixed phage lysates containing both phage 80 and HK97, phages were titered on 594 harboring either the phage 80 or HK97, which express their own repressors, respectively, and block phage superinfection.
A 1:50 dilution (in fresh broth medium: LB for E. coli , and TSB for S. aureus , S. xylosus, and L. monocytogenes ) of an overnight recipient strain carrying the empty plasmid or with immune systems was grown until an OD 600 = 1.4 was reached. Then, 1 mL of cells supplemented with CaCl 2 to a final concentration of 4.4 mM were infected with the addition of 100 μL of PICI lysate serial dilutions prepared with phage buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Mixtures of culture-PICI were plated out on LBA plates for E. coli, TSA plates for S. aureus , containing the appropriate antibiotic and 17 mM NaCitrate to prevent phage infection on the plate for S. aureus . LBA and TSA plates were incubated at 37°C for 24h. Number of colonies formed (transduction particles present in the lysate) were counted and represented as the colony forming units (CFU/mL).
GT and LT transductions were performed as described previously ( Chen et al., 2018 14. Chen, J. ∙ Quiles-Puchalt, N. ∙ Chiang, Y.N. ... Genome hypermobility by lateral transduction Science. 2018; 362 :207-212 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fillol-Salom et al., 2021 20. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Bacigalupe, R. ∙ Humphrey, S. ... Lateral transduction is inherent to the life cycle of the archetypical Salmonella phage P22 Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :6510 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). For S. aureus , a cadmium (Cd) marker that is located to the left of the φ2339 att site (not in the direction of phage packaging) was selected to test GT, while to test LT, a cadmium marker that is located to the right of the φ2339 att site, in the second headful of packaging (to avoid interference with specialized transduction), was selected. After transfer of the lysates, colonies that could grow on 0.1 mM CdCl 2 were enumerated.
For Salmonella , to test LT production, a P22 lysogen carrying a tet A marker located in the second headful was selected. The plasmids expressing the different immune systems were introduced into this strain, and the prophage induced with MC. Then, the number of phages and transducing particles was quantified, as previously reported ( Fillol-Salom et al., 2021 20. Fillol-Salom, A. ∙ Bacigalupe, R. ∙ Humphrey, S. ... Lateral transduction is inherent to the life cycle of the archetypical Salmonella phage P22 Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :6510 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For conjugation, a 1:50 dilution (in fresh LB broth) of an overnight strain carrying either the conjugative plasmid, or the empty pBAD18- km R plasmid or pBAD18- km R encoding different immune systems was grown until an OD 600 = 0.5 was reached. Then, 900 μL of recipient strain (pBAD18- km R empty or encoding immune systems) were mixed with 100 μL of donor strain (conjugative plasmid) for 30 min at 37°C without shaking. Serial dilutions from the mixture were prepared and plated out on LBA plates containing either kanamycin (30 μg mL −1 ), or kanamycin (30 μg mL −1 ) and chloramphenicol (20 μg mL −1 ). Conjugation efficiency was measured as the number of colonies obtained on the dual kanamycin and chloramphenicol selection divided by the number of colonies present with kanamycin selection alone.
Phages were evolved to overcome the PICI immune system-mediated interference. The phage plaques obtained following infection of a recipient strain carrying an immune system were collected in a tube containing 3 mL of phage buffer. Tubes were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered using a sterile 0.2 μm filter (Minisart® single use syringe filter unit) and the resultant lysate was used in a new round of phage infection. Consecutive rounds were performed until the phage overcame the PICI immune system-mediated interference, determined by increasing phage titer on the immune system-expressing recipient strain background. Then, single plaques of phage mutants were selected and amplified, which were sequenced by whole genome sequencing by MicrobesNG.
For S. aureus high resolution growth curves, bacterial strains were grown overnight, diluted 1:50, grown until early exponential phase, and normalized to an OD 600 = 0.1. Cells were then seeded into a 96 well plate, and phage was added when appropriate. The plate was then incubated in a FLUOstar Omega (BMG LABTECH) plate reader at 500 rpm, 37°C, with the OD 600 measured every ten minutes. When appropriate, the culture at the end of the experiment was extracted from the well, and phage was titered as described above.
To co-infect cells with phage (80α or Sushi) and SaPIpT1028, S. aureus RN4220 cells were infected overnight with lysates from induction experiments containing either only phage, phage with SaPIpT1028, or phage with SaPI pT1028 Sma S97A , at OD 0.01 and MOI 1 (normalizing for the phage) in TSB supplemented with 5 mM CaCl 2 . The resulting cultures were streaked out on TSA plates. To test for prophage presence, PCR was performed to amplify either the 80α repressor or the Sushi integrase. To test for SaPIpT1028, 20 colonies were streaked onto TSA plates supplemented with 10 μg mL −1 erythromycin (which selects for the erm R cassette inserted into SaPIpT1028). In the phage only condition, no resistant colonies were recovered.
For the spot assay of cells resulting from co-infection, three colonies were picked from the 80α plate, and three each were selected form the erythromycin TSA plates (for the SaPIpT1028 and SaPIpT1028 Sma S97A conditions). These were infected in a spot assay as previously described, and representative images are shown. For the bulk population protection, the cells after the initial overnight infection were regrown overnight, and the growth curve assay was performed as previously described. Since 80α lysogens naturally block infection by φ2339, an evolved φ2339 version (φ2339 E ) was generated by infecting an 80α ΔSri lysogen with φ2339, and picking a resulting plaque (which is insensitive to 80α inhibition).
For the β-Lactamase assays, RN4220 carrying pJP2834 was grown until an OD 540 = 0.2 was reached. This recipient culture was divided into aliquots and each culture was infected with 100 μL of lysate from one of the test phages. At 90 min post-infection, one-milliliter samples of each culture were collected. The culture was supplemented with 10 mM sodium azide (final concentration) immediately to stop bacterial growth and snap-frozen on dry ice. The OD 540 was measured for all samples as a reference for bacterial cell density. Then, β-Lactamase assays were performed, using nitrocefin as a substrate, in an ELx808 microplate reader (BioTek). Briefly, 50 μL of each culture was defrosted on wet ice and then diluted 1:2 (v/v) in 50 mM KPO 4 buffer (pH 5.9). Measurement of absorbance at OD 490 was started immediately following the addition of 50 μL nitrocefin working stock (6 μL of nitrocefin stock [23.8 mg/mL anhydrous nitrocefin in DMSO] diluted in 10 mL 50 mM KPO 4 buffer, pH 5.9). Plates were read every 20 s for 30 min. Relative β-lactamase activity (units/ml) was defined as (slope)[1/(A540)(d)(V)], where the slope is the Δabsorbance/hour, A 540 is the absorbance of the sample at OD 540 , d is the dilution factor, and V is the sample volume.
Experiments were repeated at least three or four times (except for Figure 5 F that was performed two times), with sample sizes indicated in the figure legends. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism v.9. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was performed to compare three or more groups. An unpaired t-test was applied to compare two groups. Adjusted p values as: ns > 0.05; ∗ p ≤ 0.05; ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.0001.
