Title: Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Engineered Human Tissues Using Clinical-Grade Soluble Human ACE2


Abstract: Summary

We have previously provided the first genetic evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ACE2 protects the lung from injury, providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to SARS-CoV infections. ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000–5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2. These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Section: Introduction

Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases continue to challenge human health. The reported incidence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic disease is increasing in many parts of the world. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) first emerged 17 years ago ( Drosten et al., 2003 10. Drosten, C. ∙ Günther, S. ∙ Preiser, W. ... Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348 :1967-1976 Crossref Scopus (3694) PubMed Google Scholar ). In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) crossed species barriers to infect humans ( Gorbalenya et al., 2020 13. Gorbalenya, A.E. ∙ Baker, S.C. ∙ Baric, R.S. ..., Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2 Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :536-544 Crossref Scopus (5056) PubMed Google Scholar ) and was effectively transmitted from person to person, leading to a pneumonia outbreak first reported in Wuhan, China ( Guan et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b 15. Guan, W.J. ∙ Ni, Z.Y. ∙ Hu, Y. ..., China Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19 Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China N. Engl. J.

A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14579) PubMed Google Scholar ). This virus causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with influenza-like symptoms ranging from mild disease to severe lung injury and multi-organ failure, eventually leading to death, especially in older patients with other co-morbidities. The WHO has declared that COVID-19 is a public health emergency of pandemic proportions ( https://www.who.int/ ). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is not only an enormous burden to public health but has already markedly affected civil societies and the global economy.
SARS-CoV-2 shares multiple similarities with SARS-CoV ( Andersen et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020 1. Andersen, K.G. ∙ Rambaut, A. ∙ Lipkin, W.I. ...

Med. 2020; 382 :727-733 Crossref Scopus (18838) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that this virus belongs to lineage B of the betacoronavirus genus ( Chan et al., 2020; Letko et al., 2020 4. Chan, J.F. ∙ Kok, K.H. ∙ Zhu, Z. ...

Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :562-569 Crossref Scopus (2078) PubMed Google Scholar ). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV RBD, suggesting a possible common host cell receptor. ACE2 was identified as the functional SARS-CoV receptor in vitro and, by our group, in vivo ( Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005 22. Imai, Y. ∙ Kuba, K. ∙ Rao, S. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from severe acute lung failure Nature. 2005; 436 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (2023) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Kuba, K. ∙ Imai, Y. ∙ Rao, S. ... A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus-induced lung injury Nat. Med. 2005; 11 :875-879 Crossref Scopus (2678) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overexpression of human ACE2 enhanced disease severity in mice infected with SARS-CoV, demonstrating that ACE2-dependent viral entry into cells is a critical step ( Yang et al., 2007 47. Yang, X.H. ∙ Deng, W. ∙ Tong, Z. ... Mice transgenic for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 provide a model for SARS coronavirus infection Comp. Med. 2007; 57 :450-459 PubMed Google Scholar ). We reported that injecting SARS-CoV spike into mice decreased ACE2 expression levels, thereby worsening lung injury ( Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005 22. Imai, Y. ∙ Kuba, K. ∙ Rao, S. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from severe acute lung failure Nature. 2005; 436 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (2023) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Kuba, K. ∙ Imai, Y. ∙ Rao, S. ... A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus-induced lung injury Nat. Med. 2005; 11 :875-879 Crossref Scopus (2678) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, ACE2 serves both as the entry receptor of SARS-CoV and to protect the lung from injury ( Zhang et al., 2020b 52. Zhang, H. ∙ Penninger, J.M. ∙ Li, Y. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target Intensive Care Med. 2020; 46 :586-590 Crossref Scopus (1871) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Three recent cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly binds to ACE2, and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein recognizes human ACE2 with even higher binding affinity than Spike from SARS-CoV ( Walls et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020 39.

Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, it has been demonstrated in cell culture that soluble ACE2 fused to Ig ( Wrapp et al., 2020 43. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ...

High doses (100 μg/mL) of camostat mesylate were also shown to partially reduce SARS-CoV-2 growth, as expected from previous studies with other viruses ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 20. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ...

In a normal adult human lung, ACE2 is expressed primarily in alveolar epithelial type II cells, which can serve as a viral reservoir ( Zhao et al., 2020 53. Zhao, Y. ∙ Zhao, Z. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCov bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ). These cells produce surfactant that reduces surface tension, thus preventing alveoli from collapsing, and hence are critical to the gas exchange function of the lung ( Dobbs, 1989 9. Dobbs, L.G. Pulmonary surfactant Annu. Rev. Med. 1989; 40 :431-446 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Injury to these cells could explain the severe lung injury observed in COVID-19 patients. We and others have also shown that ACE2 is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues including heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and intestine ( Crackower et al., 2002; Danilczyk and Penninger, 2006; Ding et al., 2004; Gu et al., 2005; Hamming et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2020b 6.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target Intensive Care Med. 2020; 46 :586-590 Crossref Scopus (1871) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ACE2 tissue distribution in these organs may explain the multi-organ dysfunction observed in patients ( Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020 15. Guan, W.J. ∙ Ni, Z.Y. ∙ Hu, Y. ..., China Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19 Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China N. Engl. J.

Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China Lancet. 2020; 395 :497-506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33243) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we report that clinical-grade human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2), which has already been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials ( Haschke et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2017 18. Haschke, M. ∙ Schuster, M. ∙ Poglitsch, M. ... Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in healthy human subjects Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2013; 52 :783-792 Crossref Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar 25. Khan, A. ∙ Benthin, C. ∙ Zeno, B. ... A pilot clinical trial of recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in acute respiratory distress syndrome Crit. Care. 2017; 21 :234 Crossref Scopus (480) PubMed Google Scholar ), can reduce viral growth in Vero E6 cells by a factor of 1,000–5,000. Moreover, we show that human blood vessel organoids and kidney organoids can be readily infected, which can be significantly inhibited by hrsACE2 at the early stage of infection.

Section: Results

To study potential therapeutic interventions for COVID-19, in early February 2020 we isolated the SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal sample of a patient in Sweden with confirmed COVID-19. After successful culture on Vero E6 cells, the isolated virus was sequenced by next-generation sequencing (GenBank: MT093571). Electron microscopy showed the prototypic coronal shape of viral particles of our SARS-CoV-2 isolate ( Figure 1 A). Phylogenetic analysis showed the virus belongs to the clad A3 ( Figure 1 B).
hrsACE2 has already undergone clinical phase 1 and phase 2 testing ( Khan et al., 2017 25. Khan, A. ∙ Benthin, C. ∙ Zeno, B. ... A pilot clinical trial of recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in acute respiratory distress syndrome Crit. Care. 2017; 21 :234 Crossref Scopus (480) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is being considered for treatment of COVID-19 ( Zhang et al., 2020b 52. Zhang, H. ∙ Penninger, J.M. ∙ Li, Y. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target Intensive Care Med. 2020; 46 :586-590 Crossref Scopus (1871) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, we wanted to provide direct evidence that clinical-grade hrsACE2 can indeed interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infections. To this end, we infected Vero-E6 cells (cells used for SARS-CoV-2 isolation) with different numbers of SARS-CoV-2: 10 3 plaque-forming units (PFUs; MOI 0.02), 10 5 PFUs (MOI 2), and 10 6 PFUs (MOI 20). Viral RNA as a marker for replication was purified from cells and assayed by qRT-PCR ( Figure 2 A). Infection of cells in the presence of hrsACE2 during 1 h, followed by washing and incubation without hrsACE2 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infections of Vero-E6 15 h post-infection ( Figure 2 A).
These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 inhibits the attachment of the virus to the cells. Importantly, as expected from a neutralizing agent, this inhibition was dependent on the initial quantity of the virus in the inoculum and the dose of hrsACE2 ( Figure 2 A), establishing dose-dependency. In contrast to hsrACE-2, the equivalent mouse recombinant soluble ACE2 (mrsACE2), produced in the same way as hrsACE2, did not inhibit the infection ( Figure 2 B). Finally, we performed experiments where cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of hrsACE2 or mrsACE2 for 15 h, to capture any newly produced virus particles during the 15 h that could infect neighboring cells. Again, we observed significantly reduced virus infections in the presence of hrsACE2 ( Figure 2 C), but not mrsACE2 ( Figure 2 D). Of note, addition of human or mouse rsACE2 was not toxic to the Vero-E6 cells, monitored for 15 h (data not shown). These data show that hrsACE2 significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infections in vitro .
A primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be the lung, which may be a source for viral spread to other tissues such as the kidney and intestine, where virus has been found (stool [ Wang et al., 2020; Young et al., 2020 41. Wang, W. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Gao, R. ... Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Different Types of Clinical Specimens JAMA. 2020; Published online March, 11, 2020 Crossref Scopus (3812) Google Scholar 50. Young, B.E. ∙ Ong, S.W.X. ∙ Kalimuddin, S. ..., Singapore 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak Research Team Epidemiologic Features and Clinical Course of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore JAMA. 2020; Published online March 3, 2020 Crossref Scopus (1469) PubMed Google Scholar ] and urine [ Ling et al., 2020 31. Ling, Y. ∙ Xu, S.B. ∙ Lin, Y.X. ... Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients Chin. Med. J. (Engl). 2020; Published online February 28, 2020 Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar ]). Moreover, viremia is established during the course of the disease, although viral RNA in blood is only infrequently observed ( Wang et al., 2020 41. Wang, W. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Gao, R. ... Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Different Types of Clinical Specimens JAMA. 2020; Published online March, 11, 2020 Crossref Scopus (3812) Google Scholar ). However, the virus has a size of 80–100 nm indicating that viremic SARS-CoV-2 must first infect blood vessels prior to local tissue infections. To test this hypothesis, we established human capillary organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) ( Figure 3 A) and infected them with our SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Of note, these organoids closely resemble human capillaries with a lumen, CD31 + endothelial lining, PDGFR + pericyte coverage, as well as formation of a basal membrane ( Wimmer et al., 2019 42. Wimmer, R.A. ∙ Leopoldi, A. ∙ Aichinger, M. ... Human blood vessel organoids as a model of diabetic vasculopathy Nature. 2019; 565 :505-510 Crossref Scopus (448) PubMed Google Scholar ). The capillary organoids were analyzed by qRT-PCR for the presence of viral RNA at day 3 and 6 after primary SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Importantly, following infection, we could detect viral RNA in the blood vessel organoids with viral RNA increasing from day 3 to day 6 post-infection ( Figure 3 B), indicating active replication of SARS-CoV-2.
Supernatant of infected organoids collected at day 6 post-infection could efficiently infect Vero E6 cells ( Figure 3 C), showing that the infected capillary organoids produced progeny virus. Importantly, addition of hrsACE2 markedly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections of the engineered human blood vessels ( Figure 3 D). Of note, addition of human or mouse rsACE2 was not toxic to human blood vessels, monitored for 3 days (data not shown). These data show that human capillary organoids can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this infection can be significantly inhibited by hrsACE2.
We and others have previously shown that ACE2 is strongly expressed in kidney tubules ( Danilczyk and Penninger, 2006 7. Danilczyk, U. ∙ Penninger, J.M. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II in the heart and the kidney Circ. Res. 2006; 98 :463-471 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the urine ( Ling et al., 2020 31. Ling, Y. ∙ Xu, S.B. ∙ Lin, Y.X. ... Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients Chin. Med. J. (Engl). 2020; Published online February 28, 2020 Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar ). To test whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human tubular kidney cells, we generated kidney organoids from human embryonic stem cells into 3D suspension culture, adapting our own protocol ( Garreta et al., 2019 12. Garreta, E. ∙ Prado, P. ∙ Tarantino, C. ... Fine tuning the extracellular environment accelerates the derivation of kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Mater. 2019; 18 :397-405 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, kidney differentiation organoids demonstrated prominent tubular-like structures as detected by Lotus tetraglobus lectin (LTL) as a marker of proximal tubular epithelial cells ( Figure 4 A). Tubular-like cells also expressed the solute carrier SCL3A1 ( Figure S1 A) together with SCL27A2 and SCL5A12. Furthermore, LTL-positive (LTL + ) cell fractions from organoids expressed markers of proximal tubular identity ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Single-cell profiling of kidney organoids showed the presence of cells expressing ACE2 in the proximal tubule and podocyte II cell clusters that express key marker genes of proximal tubular cells (SLC3A1 and SLC27A2) and podocytes (PODXL, NPHS1, and NPHS2), respectively ( Figure S2 ). Thus, kidney organoids contain cell clusters that express ACE2 in a similar fashion to that observed in the native tissue ( Lin et al., 2020 30. Lin, W., Hu, L., Zhang, Y., Ooi, J.D., Meng, T., Jin, P., Ding, X., Peng, L., Song, L., Xiao, Z., Ao, X., Xiao, X., Zhou, Q., Xiao, P., Fan, J., Zhong, Y., et al., 2020. Single-cell Analysis of ACE2 Expression in Human Kidneys and Bladders Reveals a Potential Route of 2019-nCoV Infection. bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.939892 . https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/18/2020.02.08.939892.full.pdf 2020. (Accessed 18 February 2020). Google Scholar ).
Infections of kidney organoids were monitored 6 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection and assayed for the presence of viral RNA using qRT-PCR. Progeny virus was determined as above using re-infections of Vero E6 cells. As expected from cells and tissues that express ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 replicated in kidney organoids ( Figure 4 B). Supernatant of infected kidney organoids collected at day 6 post-infection could efficiently infect Vero E6 cells ( Figure 4 C), showing that the engineered kidney organoids produced infectious progeny virus. Importantly, addition of hrsACE2 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections of the human kidney organoids in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4 D). Of note, addition of human or mouse rsACE2 was not toxic to the kidney, monitored for 3 days (data not shown). These data indicate that besides blood vessels, engineered human kidney organoids can also be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this infection can be inhibited by hrsACE2.

Section: Discussion

ACE2 took center stage in the COVID-19 outbreak as the key receptor for the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated in multiple structural and biochemical interaction studies ( Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b 43. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.L. ∙ Wang, X.G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14579) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, multiple drug development projects, including development of vaccines are focusing on the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 Spike interactions. We initially identified mammalian ACE2 when we realized that flies carry two orthologs of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Our first ace2 mutant mice then demonstrated that ACE2 is a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and genetically controls cardiovascular function and damage of multiple organs such as the lung, liver, and kidney ( Clarke and Turner, 2012; Crackower et al., 2002 5. Clarke, N.E. ∙ Turner, A.J. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: the first decade Int. J. Hypertens. 2012; 2012 :307315 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar 6. Crackower, M.A. ∙ Sarao, R. ∙ Oudit, G.Y. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an essential regulator of heart function Nature. 2002; 417 :822-828 Crossref Scopus (1501) PubMed Google Scholar ). ACE2 catalytically removes the last amino acid of angiotensin II, thereby counterbalancing ACE and Ang II actions and generating “beneficial” downstream peptides such as Ang1-7. ACE2 also catalytically acts on other peptides such as in the Apelin/APJ system ( Clarke and Turner, 2012 5. Clarke, N.E. ∙ Turner, A.J. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: the first decade Int. J. Hypertens. 2012; 2012 :307315 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Importantly, we reported that ACE2 protects from lung injury, based on its catalytic domain, and ACE2 is the critical in vivo SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein receptor ( Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005 22. Imai, Y. ∙ Kuba, K. ∙ Rao, S. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from severe acute lung failure Nature. 2005; 436 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (2023) PubMed Google Scholar 26.

Med. 2005; 11 :875-879 Crossref Scopus (2678) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initially two receptors had been identified for SARS-CoV in cell lines, namely ACE2 ( Li et al., 2003 28. Li, W. ∙ Moore, M.J. ∙ Vasilieva, N. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus Nature. 2003; 426 :450-454 Crossref Scopus (4574) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the lectin L-SIGN ( Jeffers et al., 2004 23. Jeffers, S.A. ∙ Tusell, S.M. ∙ Gillim-Ross, L. ... CD209L (L-SIGN) is a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :15748-15753 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ). The severity of SARS could be partially explained by SARS-CoV Spike protein binding to ACE2 at a molecular interaction site that does not interfere with its catalytic activity ( Li et al., 2005 29. Li, F. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Farzan, M. ... Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor Science. 2005; 309 :1864-1868 Crossref Scopus (1524) PubMed Google Scholar ), which then leads to endocytosis of the virus and loss of ACE2 ( Kuba et al., 2005 26. Kuba, K. ∙ Imai, Y. ∙ Rao, S. ... A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus-induced lung injury Nat. Med. 2005; 11 :875-879 Crossref Scopus (2678) PubMed Google Scholar ), establishing a vicious circle of viral infection and local loss of lung injury protection. This led to the initiation of a drug development program—the development of soluble recombinant human ACE2, a drug that has undergone phase 1 testing in healthy volunteers and phase 2 testing in some patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ( Haschke et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2017; Treml et al., 2010 18.

Our data now show that this clinical-grade human ACE2 molecule—but not mouse soluble ACE2—can significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections and reduce viral load by a factor of 1,000–5,000. However, as observed in antibody neutralizing experiments of many viruses, the inhibition is not complete, although clearly dose-dependent. This may be due to the fact that there might be other co-receptors/auxiliary proteins or even other mechanisms by which viruses can enter cells, as had been initially proposed for SARS ( Jeffers et al., 2004; Qi et al., 2020 23. Jeffers, S.A. ∙ Tusell, S.M. ∙ Gillim-Ross, L. ... CD209L (L-SIGN) is a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; Published online March 18, 2020 Crossref Scopus (638) Google Scholar ). Such a second receptor has been also suggested based on clinical data: SARS transmissibility was very low possibly due to the low level expression of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract ( Bertram et al., 2012; Hamming et al., 2004 3. Bertram, S. ∙ Heurich, A. ∙ Lavender, H. ... Influenza and SARS-coronavirus activating proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT are expressed at multiple sites in human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e35876 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar 17.

Pathol. 2004; 203 :631-637 Crossref Scopus (4236) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is much greater than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might use a co-receptor and/or other factors that allow infection of ACE2-expressing cells in the upper respiratory tract ( Lukassen et al., 2020 33. Lukassen, S. ∙ Chua, R.L. ∙ Trefzer, T. ... SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type in subsegmental bronchial branches bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Most importantly, our results demonstrate that hrsACE2 significantly blocks SARS-CoV-2 infections, providing a rationale that soluble ACE2 might not only protect from lung injury but also block the SARS-CoV-2 from entering target cells.
Pathology due to SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19 is not limited to the lung; damage can occur in multiple organs ( Gu et al., 2005; Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Yeung et al., 2016 14.

ACE2 is expressed in various tissues including the heart, kidney tubules, the luminal surface of the small intestine, and blood vessels ( Crackower et al., 2002; Danilczyk and Penninger, 2006; Ding et al., 2004; Gu et al., 2005; Hamming et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2020b 6.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target Intensive Care Med. 2020; 46 :586-590 Crossref Scopus (1871) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could also infect these tissues. We now show that blood vessels as well as kidney organoids can be readily infected by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 must enter the blood stream to infect other tissues. However, the size of the infectious viral particles is ∼80–100 nm ( Wrapp et al., 2020 43. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, unless there is already tissue damage, the virus must enter vascular endothelial cells to migrate into the organs. Our data in engineered human capillary organoids now suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect blood vessel cells. Infected blood vessel organoids also shed progeny viruses. Importantly, hrsACE2 markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infections of the vascular organoids.
ACE2 is strongly expressed in kidney tubules, controlling a local RAS circuit ( Clarke and Turner, 2012; Hashimoto et al., 2012 5. Clarke, N.E. ∙ Turner, A.J. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: the first decade Int. J. Hypertens. 2012; 2012 :307315 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar 19. Hashimoto, T. ∙ Perlot, T. ∙ Rehman, A. ... ACE2 links amino acid malnutrition to microbial ecology and intestinal inflammation Nature. 2012; 487 :477-481 Crossref Scopus (980) PubMed Google Scholar ). As an infection model, we therefore engineered human kidneys organoids from stem cells differentiated to contain tubular networks ( Garreta et al., 2019 12. Garreta, E. ∙ Prado, P. ∙ Tarantino, C. ... Fine tuning the extracellular environment accelerates the derivation of kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Mater. 2019; 18 :397-405 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). We now show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect such human kidney organoids, resulting in infectious viral progeny, inhibited by hrsACE2. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the urine ( Ling et al., 2020 31. Ling, Y. ∙ Xu, S.B. ∙ Lin, Y.X. ... Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients Chin. Med. J. (Engl). 2020; Published online February 28, 2020 Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar ), and many patients with COVID-19 present with cardiovascular and renal dysfunctions ( Huang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020a 21. Huang, C. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, X. ...

Whether direct viral infection of the vasculature and kidneys directly contributes to the observed multi-organ damage in COVID-19 patients needs to be established. Given the fact that cardiac cells express high levels of ACE2, and heart alterations were the first phenotype observed in our ace2 mutant mice ( Crackower et al., 2002 6. Crackower, M.A. ∙ Sarao, R. ∙ Oudit, G.Y. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an essential regulator of heart function Nature. 2002; 417 :822-828 Crossref Scopus (1501) PubMed Google Scholar ), it will be important to expand on our studies to heart and in particular lung organoids to better understand the multi-organ dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
The design of our studies focused on the early stages of infection, demonstrating that hrsACE2 can block early entry of SARS-CoV-2 infections in host cells. As such, we cannot make any predictions with respect to the effect of hrsACE2 in later stages of the disease process. Second, we did not study lung organoids, and the lung is the major target organ for COVID-19. Finally, the RAS system represents a complex network of pathways that are influenced by external processes that are not simulated in our model systems. To address these issues, further studies are needed to illuminate the effect of hrsACE2 at later stages of infection in vitro and in vivo .

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated on Vero-E6 cells, from a nasopharyngeal sample of a patient in Sweden. Virus was titered using a plaque assay as previously described ( Becker et al., 2008 2. Becker, M.M. ∙ Graham, R.L. ∙ Donaldson, E.F. ... Synthetic recombinant bat SARS-like coronavirus is infectious in cultured cells and in mice Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U S A. 2008; 105 :19944-19949 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ) with fixation of cells 72 hours post infection. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate was sequenced by Next-Generation Sequencing (GenBank accession number MT093571). For electron microscopy, viral stocks were inactivated using 35% Glutaraldehyde.
Vero-E6 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Thermofisher) supplemented with 1% Non-Essential Amino-Acid (Thermofisher), 10mM HEPES (Thermofisher) and 10% FBS at 37°C, 5% CO2. Blood vessels organoids were engineered from human iPS cells and immunostained as previously described ( Wimmer et al., 2019 42. Wimmer, R.A. ∙ Leopoldi, A. ∙ Aichinger, M. ... Human blood vessel organoids as a model of diabetic vasculopathy Nature. 2019; 565 :505-510 Crossref Scopus (448) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Clinical-grade soluble recombinant human ACE2 (amino acids 1-740) was produced by Polymun Scientific (contract manufacturer) from CHO cells according to Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines and formulated as a physiologic aqueous solution. The equivalent domain of murine ACE2 was similarly overexpressed in CHO cells under serum free conditions and purified by sequentially performing a capture step on DEAE-Sepharose, ammonium sulfate precipitation, purification via a HIC-Phenyl Sepharose column, followed by purification via a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. The purity of the murine protein was determined via HPLC, concentrations were determined with 280nm photometric measurements.
Human embryonic stem cells were grown on vitronectin coated plates (1001-015, Life Technologies) and incubated with 0.5mM EDTA (Merck) at 37 o C for 3 minutes for disaggregation. 100,000 cells/well were plated on a 24 multi-well plate coated with 5 μl/ml vitronectin and further incubated with supplemented Essential 8 Basal medium at 37 o C overnight. The day after (day 0), cells were treated for 3 subsequent days in Advanced RPMI 1640 basal medium (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 8 μM CHIR (Merck) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1% of GlutaMAX TM (ThermoFisher). The medium was changed every day. From day 3 to 4, media were changed to Advanced RPMI supplemented with 200ng/ml FGF9 (Peprotech), 1 μg/ml heparin (Merck) and 10ng/ml activin A (Vitro). On day 4, cultures were rinsed twice with PBS, and resuspended in Advanced RPMI supplemented with 5 μM CHIR, 200ng/ml FGF9 and 1 μg/ml Heparin. Cellular suspensions were seeded in V-shape 96 multi-well plate at a final concentration of 100,000 cells/well and centrifugated at 2000 rpm for 3 minutes. The resulting spheroids were incubated during 1h at 37°C. Culture media was replaced by Advanced RPMI supplemented with 200ng/ml FGF9 and 1 μg/ml Heparin for 7 additional days, the media was changed every second day. From day 11 to 16, developing organoids were incubated only in the presence of Advanced RPMI, the media was every second day.
To generate a phylogenetic tree, we created a genomic epidemiology map of different SARS-CoV-2 isolates using NextStrain tools ( https://nextstrain.org/ ) ( Hadfield et al., 2018 16. Hadfield, James ∙ Megill, Colin ∙ Bell, Sidney M. ... Nextstrain: real-time tracking of pathogen evolution Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4121-4123 Crossref Scopus (1781) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sequences of the different isolates were obtained from GISAID ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ) ( Elbe and Buckland-Merret, 2017 11. Elbe, S. ∙ Buckland-Merret, G. Data, disease and diplomacy: GISAID’s innovative contribution to global health Glob Chall. 2017; 1 :33-46 Crossref Scopus (1137) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Vero E6 cells were seeded in 48-well plates (5.10 4 cells per well) (Sarstedt) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. 24 hours post-seeding, hrsACE2 or mrsACE2 were mixed with different concentration of virus (1:1) in a final volume of 100μl per well in DMEM (0% FBS) at 37°C. After 30 minutes, Vero-E6 were infected either with mixes containing hrsACE2/SARS-CoV-2 and mrsACE2/SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour followed by washing or for 15 hours without washing, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and 500μl of new complete medium supplemented with hrsACE2 or mrsACE2 were added. 15 hours post-infection, supernatants were removed, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and then lysed using Trizol (Thermofisher) before analysis by qRT-PCR for viral RNA detection.
Kidney organoids were infected with 10 3 or 10 5 SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles in advanced RPMI medium (Thermofisher). Blood vessels organoids were infected with 10 2 , 10 4 , or 10 6 SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles in StemPro complete media containing 15% FBS (GIBCO cat.10500064), 100ng/ml of VEGF-A (Peprotech cat. no. 100-20) and 100ng/ml of FGF-2 (Milteny Biotech cat. no. 130-093-841) as previously described ( Wimmer et al., 2019 42. Wimmer, R.A. ∙ Leopoldi, A. ∙ Aichinger, M. ... Human blood vessel organoids as a model of diabetic vasculopathy Nature. 2019; 565 :505-510 Crossref Scopus (448) PubMed Google Scholar ) in a volume of 50μl per well of a 96-well ultra-low attachment plate for 1 hour. One hour post-infection, organoids were washed 3 times with PBS and kept in 100μl of corresponding medium for 3 to 6 days. On day 3 post-infection, organoids were washed 3 times with PBS before being lysed with Trizol (Thermofisher). At day 6 post-infection, supernatants were recovered and organoids washed 3 times with PBS before to lysis with Trizol (Thermofisher). Samples were then analyzed for the presence of viral RNA by qRT-PCR. 100μl of each supernatant were used to infect Vero E6 in 48-well plate plates. Cells were recovered 48 hours post-infection, pooled (5 blood vessels organoids/ condition, 3 kidney organoids/condition), and the level of infection was determined by viral RNA detection using qRT-PCR.
Different concentrations of hrsACE2 were mixed with 10 6 particles of SARS-CoV-2 for 30min at 37°C in a final volume of 50μl per well in STemPro 34 complete medium (blood vessels) or advanced RPMI medium (Kidneys) as described above. Organoids were then infected with the mixes for 1 hour at 37°C, washed 3 times with PBS and 100μl per well of new medium was added. To detect intracellular viral RNA, organoids were washed 3 times with PBS, pooled (5 organoids/condition for blood vessels; 3 organoids/condition for kidneys) and lysed using Trizol (Thermofisher) before analysis by qRT-PCR for viral RNA detection.
To determine whether human or mouse rsACE2 are toxic to cells, 10 4 Vero E6 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well plate. 24h post-seeding, 25μl of different concentrations (25 – 200 μg/ml of rsACE2 were added in triplicate and incubated for 15h. 15h post-treatment, cytotoxicity was determined using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) following the following the manufacturer’s protocol using 50μl of CellTiter-Glo® Reagent per well.
Samples were extracted using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). qRT-PCR was performed using E-gene SARS-CoV-2 primers/probe following guidelines by the World Health Organization ( https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/wuhan-virus-assay-v1991527e5122341d99287a1b17c111902.pdf ) Forward primer: 5′-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3′ Reverse primer: 5′-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3′ Probe: FAM-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-QSY RNase P was used as an endogenous gene control to normalize the levels of intracellular viral RNA.

Kidney organoids were homogenized using 21G and 26 1/2G syringes and further dissociated using Accumax (07921, Stem Cell Technologies9 for 15 min at 37°C followed by Trypsin-EDTA 0,25% (wt/vol) trypsin (25300-054, Life Technologies) for additional 15 min at 37°C. The reaction was deactivated by adding 10% FBS. The solution was then passed through a 40 μm cell strainer and frozen in Advanced RPMI 1640 basal medium (ThermoFisher) in the presence of DMSO 10%. Cells were thawed and centrifuged at 1,500 RPM for 5 minutes, stained with sytox blue (Thermofisher) and sorted by FACS to remove the nonviable cells, generating a single cell suspension with greater than 90% viability analyzed using the cellometer K2 (Nexcelom Biocience). Libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ GEM, v3, (PN-1000075, 10X genomics) following the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced with a NEXTseq500 (R1:28, R2: 55, i7:8) up to 30.000 reads per cell.
Kidneys organoid and LTL+ cells were washed with PBS. Next samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (153799, Aname) for 20 min at room temperature. Specimens were washed twice with PBS and further blocked using Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 6% donkey serum (S30, Millipore) and 1% Triton X-100 (T8787, Sigma) for 1h at room temperature. After three rinses with antibody dilution buffer, samples were treated for 4h at room temperature with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor (A) Cy3- or A647-; 1:200). A previous blocking step with a streptavidin/biotin blocking kit (SP-2002, Vector Labs) was performed for biotinylated LTL (B-1325, Vector Labs) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (SA5488, VectorLabs) to detect LTL+ cells. Antibodies to NEPHRIN (R&D SYSTEMS 4269; 1:100) and LAMININ (Sigma L9393; 1:50), SGLT2 (Abcam AB37296; 1:100), NaKATPase (Abcam; AB209299; 1:200) and SLC3A1 (Sigma HPA038360; 1:50) were used overnight at 4°C diluted in antibody dilution buffer consisting of TBS with 6% donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100. Nuclei were detected using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:5000, D1306, Life Technologies) for 30min. For mounting, samples were immersed in Fluoromount-G (0100-01, Southern Biotech). Sample confocal images were acquired with an SP5 Leica microscope and LTL + were analyzed using ImageJ.
For the isolation of LTL+ cells kidney organoids were stained with fluorescein-conjugated LTL (FL-1321, Vector Laboratories). Then specimens were dissociated to single cells using Accumax (07921, Stem Cell Technologies) for 15min followed by 0.25% (wt/vol) trypsin (25300–054, Life Technologies) for 15min at 37 °C. For LTL+ cells isolation FACSDiva software version 8.0.1 (BD Biosciences) was used in the FACS Aria Fusion instrument (BD Biosciences).
Libraries were pre-processed using Cell Ranger (3.0.1) from 10X Genomics. The computational analysis was performed using Seurat (3.0.2) ( Stuart et al., 2019 37. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6794) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initial quality control parameters were defined based on the distributions of the number of detected genes per cell, the number of UMIs per cell and the % of UMIs assigned to mitochondrial genes. The selected thresholds were: 668 < UMIs per cell < 23101, 489 < Genes per cell < 5651 and % UMIs assigned to mitochondrial genes < 50. The dataset was subjected to normalization, identification of highly variable features and scaling using the SCTransform function of the Seurat package. Principal component analysis was performed, and 20 components were kept for further analysis. Clustering was performed by setting the resolution parameter to 0.4. Dimensional reduction was done using the RunUMAP function of the Seurat R package. Cell markers were identified by using a Wilcoxon test. Genes with adjusted p.value < 0.5 were retained. Clusters were labeled by comparing the expression of the identified markers with publicly available databases ( Wu et al., 2018b 46. Wu, H. ∙ Uchimura, K. ∙ Donnelly, E.L. ... Comparative Analysis and Refinement of Human PSC-Derived Kidney Organoid Differentiation with Single-Cell Transcriptomics Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 23 :869-881 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (359) PubMed Google Scholar ) located in KIT (Kidney Interactive Transcriptomics webpage ( http://humphreyslab.com/SingleCell/ ).
Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad) and significance was determined by Student’s t test.
