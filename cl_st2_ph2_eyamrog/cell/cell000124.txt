Title: A Dual-Mechanism Antibiotic Kills Gram-Negative Bacteria and Avoids Drug Resistance


Abstract: Summary

The rise of antibiotic resistance and declining discovery of new antibiotics has created a global health crisis. Of particular concern, no new antibiotic classes have been approved for treating Gram-negative pathogens in decades. Here, we characterize a compound, SCH-79797, that kills both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria through a unique dual-targeting mechanism of action (MoA) with undetectably low resistance frequencies. To characterize its MoA, we combined quantitative imaging, proteomic, genetic, metabolomic, and cell-based assays. This pipeline demonstrates that SCH-79797 has two independent cellular targets, folate metabolism and bacterial membrane integrity, and outperforms combination treatments in killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) persisters. Building on the molecular core of SCH-79797, we developed a derivative, Irresistin-16, with increased potency and showed its efficacy against Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a mouse vaginal infection model. This promising antibiotic lead suggests that combining multiple MoAs onto a single chemical scaffold may be an underappreciated approach to targeting challenging bacterial pathogens.

Section: Introduction

More than twenty unique classes of antibiotics were characterized in the 30 years following the discovery of penicillin in 1929 ( Coates et al., 2011; Davies, 2006 13. Coates, A.R. ∙ Halls, G. ∙ Hu, Y. Novel classes of antibiotics or more of the same? Br. J. Pharmacol. 2011; 163 :184-194 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar 15. Davies, J. Where have All the Antibiotics Gone? Can. J. Infect. Dis. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 17 :287-290 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a combination of scientific and economic factors have slowed the discovery and development of these life-saving molecules to the extent that only six new classes of antibiotics have been approved in the past 20 years, none of which are active against Gram-negative bacteria ( Butler et al., 2017 7. Butler, M.S. ∙ Blaskovich, M.A. ∙ Cooper, M.A. Antibiotics in the clinical pipeline at the end of 2015 J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2017; 70 :3-24 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). This decline in the discovery of new antibiotic classes, coupled with the evolution of multi-drug resistant bacteria and horizontal transfer of resistance mechanisms, has created a public health crisis that is predicted to only escalate in the coming years ( Culyba et al., 2015; Hofer, 2019; O’Neill, 2014 14. Culyba, M.J. ∙ Mo, C.Y. ∙ Kohli, R.M. Targets for Combating the Evolution of Acquired Antibiotic Resistance Biochemistry. 2015; 54 :3573-3582 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Hofer, U.

AMR Review Paper–Tackling a Crisis for the Health and Wealth of Nations AMR Review Paper, 2014 Google Scholar ).
Recent efforts have begun to reinvigorate antibiotics research, but most of this work has resulted in compounds that function via similar mechanisms to those of traditional antibiotics. For example, finafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that was recently approved to treat ear infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , is more effective than other fluoroquinolones because it maintains its potency in acidic environments ( McKeage, 2015 33. McKeage, K. Finafloxacin: first global approval Drugs. 2015; 75 :687-693 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, finafloxacin is still susceptible to the same resistance mechanisms that affect other fluoroquinolones ( Randall et al., 2016 41. Randall, L.B. ∙ Georgi, E. ∙ Genzel, G.H. ... Finafloxacin overcomes Burkholderia pseudomallei efflux-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2016; 72 :1258-1260 Google Scholar ). The recent discovery of the natural product teixobactin suggests that it is possible to find compounds that selectively kill bacteria without being prone to resistance ( Ling et al., 2015 30. Ling, L.L. ∙ Schneider, T. ∙ Peoples, A.J. ... A new antibiotic kills pathogens without detectable resistance Nature. 2015; 517 :455-459 Crossref Scopus (1813) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, teixobactin is only functional against Gram-positive bacteria. Another natural product, darobactin, was recently found to specifically target Gram-negative bacteria, but resistance to darobactin was relatively easy to achieve through mutations in bamA ( Imai et al., 2019 23. Imai, Y. ∙ Meyer, K.J. ∙ Iinishi, A. ... A new antibiotic selectively kills Gram-negative pathogens Nature. 2019; 576 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, there is still a strong need for characterizing new classes of antibiotics with distinct mechanisms of action (MoA), especially those that target Gram-negatives with low resistance frequency.
An ideal antibiotic would be hard to develop resistance against, able to kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and easy to access. It is important to note that while antibiotics that are not prone to resistance are attractive clinically, selecting for resistant mutants is the most common method for characterizing MoA, making the characterization of new antibiotic MoAs without resistance mutants a significant challenge. Phenotypic methods, such as macromolecular synthesis assays, have been previously used in such cases, as was done for teixobactin ( Ling et al., 2015 30. Ling, L.L. ∙ Schneider, T. ∙ Peoples, A.J. ... A new antibiotic kills pathogens without detectable resistance Nature. 2015; 517 :455-459 Crossref Scopus (1813) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these assays only allow the classification of molecules with previously described MoAs ( King and Wu, 2009 27. King, A.C. ∙ Wu, L. Macromolecular synthesis and membrane perturbation assays for mechanisms of action studies of antimicrobial agents Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2009; Chapter 13 Unit 13A.17 PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, there is also a need for resistance-independent approaches for the de novo characterization of antibiotic MoA.
Here, we describe a compound, SCH-79797, which is bactericidal toward both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including clinically significant bacterial pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , and Acinetobacter baumannii , with no signs of resistance. In an animal host model, SCH-79797 blocked infection by A. baumannii with low toxicity to the host at the dose required for effective antibiotic activity. To rapidly and efficiently classify the MoA of SCH-79797, we used a variant of a recently described quantitative imaging-based approach known as bacterial cytological profiling (BCP) ( Nonejuie et al., 2013 34. Nonejuie, P. ∙ Burkart, M. ∙ Pogliano, K. ... Bacterial cytological profiling rapidly identifies the cellular pathways targeted by antibacterial molecules Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :16169-16174 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). This effort showed that SCH-79797 functions through a mechanism distinct from that of most known classes of antibiotics. In the absence of being able to evolve resistant mutants, we used thermal proteome profiling ( Savitski et al., 2014 43. Savitski, M.M. ∙ Reinhard, F.B.M. ∙ Franken, H. ... Tracking cancer drugs in living cells by thermal profiling of the proteome Science. 2014; 346 :1255784 Crossref Scopus (746) PubMed Google Scholar ), CRISPRi genetic sensitivity ( Peters et al., 2016 39. Peters, J.M. ∙ Colavin, A. ∙ Shi, H. ... A Comprehensive, CRISPR-based Functional Analysis of Essential Genes in Bacteria Cell. 2016; 165 :1493-1506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ), and metabolomic profiling ( Kwon et al., 2008; Kwon et al., 2010 28. Kwon, Y.K. ∙ Lu, W. ∙ Melamud, E. ... A domino effect in antifolate drug action in Escherichia coli Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4 :602-608 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Kwon, Y.K. ∙ Higgins, M.B. ∙ Rabinowitz, J.D. Antifolate-induced depletion of intracellular glycine and purines inhibits thymineless death in E. coli ACS Chem. Biol. 2010; 5 :787-795 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ) to characterize the MoA of SCH-79797. Using this multi-dimensional, systems-level approach, we identified the candidate targets of SCH-79797 as dihydrofolate reductase and the bacterial membrane. Classical enzymology and membrane permeability and polarization assays confirmed the targets identified by our high-throughput approaches. By analyzing derivatives of the SCH-79797 structure, we demonstrated that the two pharmacophores of this compound can be distinguished. Finally, we describe a derivative of SCH-79797, Irresistin-16 (IRS-16), with improved potency that demonstrates efficacy in a mouse vaginal Neisseria gonorrhoeae model. Thus, our findings identify and characterize a promising antibiotic candidate and provide a potential roadmap for future antibiotic discovery efforts.

Section: Results

With the aim of finding antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action (MoA), we began with an unbiased, whole-cell screening approach. To include antibiotics that target both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, we screened for compounds that inhibited the growth of E. coli lptD4213 , which has a compromised outer membrane that makes it partially permeable to antibiotics that would otherwise have difficulty penetrating the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide ( Ruiz et al., 2006 42. Ruiz, N. ∙ Kahne, D. ∙ Silhavy, T.J. Advances in understanding bacterial outer-membrane biogenesis Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4 :57-66 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). We screened a small molecule library of ∼33,000 unique compounds and one of our most potent hits was SCH-79797, a compound that had been previously reported as a human PAR-1 antagonist ( Ahn et al., 2000 1. Ahn, H.S. ∙ Foster, C. ∙ Boykow, G. ... Inhibition of cellular action of thrombin by N3-cyclopropyl-7-[[4-(1-methylethyl)phenyl]methyl]-7H-pyrrolo[3, 2-f]quinazoline-1,3-diamine (SCH 79797), a nonpeptide thrombin receptor antagonist Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60 :1425-1434 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). This finding was surprising because there are no PAR-1 homologs in bacteria. A recent report suggested that SCH-79797 increases the ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria, perhaps by directly functioning as an antibiotic ( Gupta et al., 2018 19. Gupta, N. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Shin, S. ... SCH79797 improves outcomes in experimental bacterial pneumonia by boosting neutrophil killing and direct antibiotic activity J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2018; 73 :1586-1594 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that studies focusing on characterizing its anticoagulant activities suggested that at least 5 mg/kg SCH-79797 can be safely tolerated in animals ( Gobbetti et al., 2012; Strande et al., 2007 18. Gobbetti, T. ∙ Cenac, N. ∙ Motta, J.-P. ... Serine protease inhibition reduces post-ischemic granulocyte recruitment in mouse intestine Am. J. Pathol. 2012; 180 :141-152 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar 46. Strande, J.L. ∙ Hsu, A. ∙ Su, J. ... SCH 79797, a selective PAR1 antagonist, limits myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat hearts Basic Res. Cardiol. 2007; 102 :350-358 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) and its emergence as a potential antimicrobial with no known bacterial target ( Gupta et al., 2018 19. Gupta, N. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Shin, S. ... SCH79797 improves outcomes in experimental bacterial pneumonia by boosting neutrophil killing and direct antibiotic activity J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2018; 73 :1586-1594 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), we decided to further characterize SCH-79797 as a candidate antibiotic.
To assess the spectrum of bacterial species susceptible to SCH-79797, we measured the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of SCH-79797 against several clinically relevant pathogens, including the ESKAPE pathogens ( Boucher et al., 2009 5. Boucher, H.W. ∙ Talbot, G.H. ∙ Bradley, J.S. ... Bad bugs, no drugs: no ESKAPE! An update from the Infectious Diseases Society of America Clin. Infect. Dis. 2009; 48 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (4050) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we define MIC as the concentration of drug that results in no visible bacterial growth after 14 h of growth at 37°C. We found that SCH-79797 significantly hindered the growth of multiple Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, two clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii , Enterococcus faecalis , and Staphylococcus aureus ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ). SCH-79797 also exhibited potent activity against several antibiotic-resistant pathogen strains including multi-drug-resistant WHO-L N. gonorrhoeae and MRSA S. aureus. Using the E. coli lptD4213 strain from our original screen, SCH-79797 exhibited potent and rapid bactericidal activity ( Figures 1 B and 1C). SCH-79797 also exhibited similar bactericidal activity against a clinical isolate of S. aureus MRSA USA300 ( Tenover and Goering, 2009 49. Tenover, F.C. ∙ Goering, R.V. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain USA300: origin and epidemiology J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2009; 64 :441-446 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggesting that its bactericidal activity is not species-specific ( Figure S1 A).
Given SCH-79797’s promising ability to kill bacteria, we sought to determine if it can function as an effective antibiotic in vivo . To test its antibiotic activity in the context of an animal host infection, we focused on A. baumannii as it has emerged as an important Gram-negative pathogen that is targeted by relatively few available antibiotics, and has a well-established host animal model in the wax worm, Galleria mellonella ( Gebhardt et al., 2015; Peleg et al., 2009 16. Gebhardt, M.J. ∙ Gallagher, L.A. ∙ Jacobson, R.K. ... Joint Transcriptional Control of Virulence and Resistance to Antibiotic and Environmental Stress in Acinetobacter baumannii MBio. 2015; 6 :e01660-15 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Peleg, A.Y. ∙ Jara, S. ∙ Monga, D. ... Galleria mellonella as a model system to study Acinetobacter baumannii pathogenesis and therapeutics Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53 :2605-2609 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first established that injecting G. mellonella with SCH-79797 at concentrations four times higher than the MIC of SCH-79797 toward A. baumannii did not result in higher host toxicity than the solvent-only control ( Figures S1 E and S1F; Table S2 ). We next tested the ability of SCH-79797 to treat infection of G. mellonella with a lethal dose of A. baumannii AB17978. Treatment with SCH-79797 significantly prolonged the survival of A. baumannii -infected G. mellonella (p < 0.001) ( Figures 1 D, S1 G, and S1H). The survival rate of G. mellonella treated with SCH-79797 was similar to the control antibiotics meropenem, rifampicin, and gentamicin ( Figures 1 D, S1 G, and S1H) ( Karlowsky et al., 2003; Viehman et al., 2014 25. Karlowsky, J.A. ∙ Draghi, D.C. ∙ Jones, M.E. ... Surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility among clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii from hospitalized patients in the United States, 1998 to 2001 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47 :1681-1688 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Viehman, J.A. ∙ Nguyen, M.H. ∙ Doi, Y. Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections Drugs. 2014; 74 :1315-1333 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further characterize its promise as an antibiotic, we attempted to determine the frequency with which bacteria develop resistance toward SCH-79797. Because spontaneous suppressors can restore E. coli lptD4213’ s membrane barrier functionality, we focused our resistance studies on S. aureus MRSA USA300 ( Tenover and Goering, 2009 49. Tenover, F.C. ∙ Goering, R.V. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain USA300: origin and epidemiology J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2009; 64 :441-446 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). We were unable to isolate stable SCH-79797-resistant mutants upon plating ∼10 8 CFU of MRSA USA300 onto agar containing 25 μg/mL SCH-79797 (4X MIC). We were also unable to isolate SCH-79797-resistant mutants upon plating ∼10 8 colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. subtilis , suggesting that the difficulty in developing resistant mutants is not species-specific. To address resistance rates more quantitatively, we serial-passaged 2 biologically independent cultures of S. aureus MRSA USA300 in sub-lethal concentrations of SCH-79797, as well as three control antibiotics: novobiocin, trimethoprim, and nisin. Over the course of 25 days, we successfully isolated mutants resistant to all the control antibiotics while no SCH-79797-resistant mutants emerged ( Figures 1 E and S1 B). For novobiocin, trimethoprim, and nisin, resistance gradually increased throughout the experiment, while the resistance level remained constant for SCH-79797 ( Figures 1 E and S1 B), indicating that these bacteria did not even acquire partial resistance to SCH-79797. In addition, the mutants that evolved increased resistance to antibiotics like trimethoprim and nisin did not demonstrate cross-resistance to SCH-79797 ( Figure S1 D). To extend these findings to a Gram-negative species, we repeated our serial passaging study with 2 biologically independent cultures of A. baumannii AB17978 ( Figure S1 C). A. baumannii resistance remained constant for SCH-79797 but increased for all other antibiotics, including gentamycin, supporting the conclusion that the lack of resistance to SCH-79797 is not species-specific.
The inability to isolate SCH-79797-resistant mutants makes SCH-79797 an appealing candidate antibiotic but poses a challenge for determining its MoA. As a result, we used a quantitative imaging-based approach to determine if the MoA of SCH-79797 is similar to that of any previously characterized antibiotics. Specifically, we modified a single-cell, high-content imaging methodology, known as BCP ( Nonejuie et al., 2013 34. Nonejuie, P. ∙ Burkart, M. ∙ Pogliano, K. ... Bacterial cytological profiling rapidly identifies the cellular pathways targeted by antibacterial molecules Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :16169-16174 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). The logic of BCP is that antibiotics with similar MoA result in similar death phenotypes such that by quantifying how bacteria appear upon death, we can gain insight into the cause of death (much like a bacterial autopsy). Here, we applied our BCP analysis to a training set of 37 distinct antibiotics with known MoA as well as to SCH-79797. For each compound, we treated E. coli lptD4213 with 5X MIC of an antibiotic for 2 h, stained with three dyes that report on nucleoid morphology (DAPI), membrane morphology (FM4-64), and membrane integrity (SYTOX Green), and imaged the cells at high resolution ( Figure 2 A). For each condition we imaged ∼100 cells and quantified 14 parameters reflecting various morphological and fluorescence features ( Table S3 ).
Because we had gold standards of the BCP results of SCH-79797 and of several antibiotics representing different classes and sub-groups within classes, we applied a machine learning approach to classify the BCP data. Using a one-way MANOVA, we performed dimensionality reduction to remove the influence of naturally covarying metrics, such as cell length and cell perimeter. We then used single-linkage clustering to cluster treatment groups by their neighborhood representation vectors, such that samples whose neighborhoods were similar would be clustered together. This analysis indicated that SCH-79797 resulted in a phenotypic death-state that was different from the other antibiotics tested ( Figure 2 B). We also tested an additional method to assess whether this result was robust to multiple statistical methods. Using UMAP for dimensionality reduction on Z score normalized data ( McInnes et al., 2018 32. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1802.03426 Google Scholar ), we found that SCH-79797-treated cells formed a distinct peak separated from other treatments ( Figure S2 ). This result supports our conclusion that SCH-79797 is dissimilar from most antibiotics tested and therefore likely possesses a MoA distinct from that of any of the antibiotics in our training set.
In the absence of resistant mutants or similarity to antibiotics with known MoA by BCP, we turned to a high-throughput proteomics-based approach for de novo identification of candidate SCH-79797 targets. Specifically, we used thermal proteome profiling, an assay that uses mass spectrometry to compare the thermal stability of the entire proteome with and without drug treatment (schematized in Figure 3 A) ( Mateus et al., 2018; Savitski et al., 2014 31. Mateus, A. ∙ Bobonis, J. ∙ Kurzawa, N. ... Thermal proteome profiling in bacteria: probing protein state in vivo Mol. Syst. Biol. 2018; 14 :e8242 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Savitski, M.M. ∙ Reinhard, F.B.M. ∙ Franken, H. ... Tracking cancer drugs in living cells by thermal profiling of the proteome Science. 2014; 346 :1255784 Crossref Scopus (746) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, intact cells or cell lysate samples treated with a range of compound concentrations are heated to a series of increasing temperatures and the soluble proteins at each temperature are collected ( Becher et al., 2016 3. Becher, I. ∙ Werner, T. ∙ Doce, C. ... Thermal profiling reveals phenylalanine hydroxylase as an off-target of panobinostat Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12 :908-910 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Proteins that bind to the drug are thermally stabilized, which leads to a shift in the temperature at which those proteins precipitate ( Figure 3 A). Using E. coli lptD4213 , we treated intact cells and cell lysates with SCH-79797 and found that it significantly shifted the thermal stability of dihydrofolate reductase (the DHFR homolog in E. coli is known as FolA) ( Figures 3 B and S3 A). The fact that the same result was observed with both intact cells and cell lysates ( Figures 3 B and S3 A) suggests that SCH-79797 enters E. coli cells and directly binds to FolA. As a positive control, we used a well-characterized antibiotic that targets DHFR, trimethoprim, and found that it also thermally stabilizes its known target, the E. coli DHFR, FolA ( Figures 3 C and S3 B) ( Gleckman et al., 1981 17. Gleckman, R. ∙ Blagg, N. ∙ Joubert, D.W. Trimethoprim: mechanisms of action, antimicrobial activity, bacterial resistance, pharmacokinetics, adverse reactions, and therapeutic indications Pharmacotherapy. 1981; 1 :14-20 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To test both the physiological significance and species-specificity of the suggestion that SCH-79797 binds to DHFR, we took advantage of a collection of B. subtilis essential gene CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) knockdown mutants ( Peters et al., 2016 39. Peters, J.M. ∙ Colavin, A. ∙ Shi, H. ... A Comprehensive, CRISPR-based Functional Analysis of Essential Genes in Bacteria Cell. 2016; 165 :1493-1506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ). In each of these mutants, an essential gene is targeted by CRISPRi to reduce its expression ∼3-fold. A strain with reduced levels of the SCH-79797 target should be sensitized to sub-lethal doses of SCH-79797. Given the thermal profiling result, we focused on mutants in the folate biosynthesis pathway (schematized in Figure 4 A). As a negative control, we confirmed that CRISPRi knockdowns of genes unrelated to folate metabolism are not sensitized to SCH-79797 ( Figure S4 ). As a positive control for our assay, we again utilized trimethoprim. We confirmed that dihydrofolate reductase ( dfrA in B. subtilis ) and dihydrofolate synthase ( folC , an enzyme that acts upstream of DfrA) knockdowns are hypersensitive to trimethoprim, while knockdowns of enzymes that function downstream of DHFR, folD and glyA , are not ( Figure 4 B). SCH-79797 exhibited the same genetic sensitivity pattern as trimethoprim in that both dfrA and folC , but not folD and glyA knockdowns, were sensitized to SCH-79797 ( Figure 4 B).
To determine how SCH-79797 affects folate metabolism in living cells, we used mass spectrometry to measure the relative abundance of folate metabolite pools in E. coli NCM3722 treated with SCH-79797. E. coli NCM3722 was used because these bacteria lack mutations that disrupt primary metabolism in other lab strains of E. coli ( Soupene et al., 2003 45. Soupene, E. ∙ van Heeswijk, W.C. ∙ Plumbridge, J. ... Physiological studies of Escherichia coli strain MG1655: growth defects and apparent cross-regulation of gene expression J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185 :5611-5626 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). E. coli NCM3722 cells were grown in Gutnick Minimal Media and treated with 13.9 μg/mL SCH-79797 (1× MIC) for 15 min ( Kwon et al., 2008, 2010 28. Kwon, Y.K. ∙ Lu, W. ∙ Melamud, E. ... A domino effect in antifolate drug action in Escherichia coli Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4 :602-608 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Kwon, Y.K. ∙ Higgins, M.B. ∙ Rabinowitz, J.D. Antifolate-induced depletion of intracellular glycine and purines inhibits thymineless death in E. coli ACS Chem. Biol. 2010; 5 :787-795 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). In response to SCH-79797 treatment, the levels of the DHFR substrate, 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF), rose ∼10-fold compared to untreated cells, while the levels of folate metabolites downstream of DHF dropped significantly ( Figure 4 C). This metabolic response is characteristic of dihydrofolate reductase (FolA in E. coli ) inhibition as we observed a similar pattern upon treatment with trimethoprim, a known inhibitor of DHFR ( Figure 4 C) ( Gleckman et al., 1981 17. Gleckman, R. ∙ Blagg, N. ∙ Joubert, D.W. Trimethoprim: mechanisms of action, antimicrobial activity, bacterial resistance, pharmacokinetics, adverse reactions, and therapeutic indications Pharmacotherapy. 1981; 1 :14-20 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine whether SCH-79797 inhibits DHFR directly, we obtained purified E. coli FolA protein and measured its enzymatic activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of SCH-79797. We found that SCH-79797 has an IC 50 of 8.6 ± 3 μM against FolA ( Figure 4 D). We also measured the initial velocity of FolA activity at various DHF substrate concentrations to establish if SCH-79797 acts competitively or non-competitively. A Michaelis-Menten fit to the data demonstrated that 8.6 μM SCH-79797 (the IC 50 ) increases the K m from 32 ± 25 μM to 100 ± 80 μM. These results indicate that SCH-79797 functions at least partially as a competitive inhibitor of FolA’s activity on its DHF substrate ( Figure 4 E). Likewise, the Michaelis-Menten fits for the established FolA inhibitor trimethoprim show a very similar effect IC 50 = 15 ± 4 nM ( Figure 4 D), consistent with previous measurements of the tight binding between trimethoprim and E. coli FolA ( Cammarata et al., 2017 8. Cammarata, M. ∙ Thyer, R. ∙ Lombardo, M. ... Characterization of trimethoprim resistant E. coli dihydrofolate reductase mutants by mass spectrometry and inhibition by propargyl-linked antifolates Chem. Sci. (Camb.). 2017; 8 :4062-4072 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
The similarities between SCH-79797 and trimethoprim with respect to FolA inhibition helped confirm DHFR as a target of SCH-79797 but were also surprising because these two compounds did not generate similar profiles in our BCP analysis ( Figure 2 B). One potential explanation is that SCH-79797 has additional targets that are not shared with trimethoprim. If this was the case, we would expect that cells resistant to trimethoprim would still be susceptible to SCH-79797. Previous studies demonstrated that resistance to trimethoprim can be achieved by deleting thyA and supplementing the media with thymine ( Amyes and Smith, 1975 2. Amyes, S.G. ∙ Smith, J.T. Thymineless mutants and their resistance to trimethoprim J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1975; 1 :85-89 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed that deleting thyA from E. coli lptD4213 in the presence of excess thymine led to trimethoprim resistance ( Figure 5 A). We also found that thymine supplementation decreased the sensitivity of E. coli lptD4213 to SCH-79797 (comparing “WT” of Figure 5 A to Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). The findings that reducing cellular dependence on DHFR activity (by thymine supplementation) makes cells less sensitive to SCH-79797 treatment, while increasing reliance on DHFR activity (by dfrA CRISPRi) makes cells more sensitive to SCH-79797, together indicate that DHFR inhibition is a physiologically important target of SCH-79797. Nevertheless, comparing cells with and without thyA in the presence of thymine showed no change in sensitivity to SCH-79797 ( Figure 5 A), suggesting that SCH-79797 is likely to have a second, folate-independent MoA.
To obtain clues about the potential additional MoA of SCH-79797, we revisited our fluorescent BCP images of E. coli lptD4213 cells treated with SCH-79797. We observed SYTOX Green staining in some of the bacteria ( Figure 2 A), suggesting that SCH-79797 compromises the integrity of the bacterial membrane. To directly quantify the effect of SCH-79797 on bacterial membrane integrity, we used flow cytometry to measure the membrane potential and permeability of E. coli lptD4213 in the presence of the fluorescent dyes, DiOC 2 (3) and TO-PRO-3. DiOC 2 (3) is a cationic dye that accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells with an active membrane potential and shifts its fluorescence from red to green in these cells, providing a measure of membrane potential ( Figure 5 B) ( Novo et al., 1999 35. Novo, D. ∙ Perlmutter, N.G. ∙ Hunt, R.H. ... Accurate flow cytometric membrane potential measurement in bacteria using diethyloxacarbocyanine and a ratiometric technique Cytometry. 1999; 35 :55-63 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). TO-PRO-3 is a nucleic acid stain that only accumulates in cells with compromised membranes, providing an independent measure of membrane permeability ( Figure 5 B) ( Novo et al., 2000 36. Novo, D.J. ∙ Perlmutter, N.G. ∙ Hunt, R.H. ...

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44 :827-834 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). As positive controls, we observed the expected shifts in both DiOC 2 (3) and TO-PRO-3 staining using CCCP, a membrane-decoupler that affects membrane potential but not permeability ( Novo et al., 2000 36. Novo, D.J. ∙ Perlmutter, N.G. ∙ Hunt, R.H. ...

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44 :827-834 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ), and two compounds that disrupt both membrane potential and permeability: nisin, a pore-forming antibacterial peptide ( Prince et al., 2016; Wiedemann et al., 2001 40. Prince, A. ∙ Sandhu, P. ∙ Ror, P. ... Lipid-II Independent Antimicrobial Mechanism of Nisin Depends On Its Crowding And Degree Of Oligomerization Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :37908 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Wiedemann, I. ∙ Breukink, E. ∙ van Kraaij, C. ...

Chem. 2001; 276 :1772-1779 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (645) PubMed Google Scholar ), and polymyxin B, a small lipopeptide membrane destabilizer ( Warren et al., 1957 53. Warren, G.H. ∙ Gray, J. ∙ Yurchenco, J.A. Effect of polymyxin on the lysis of Neisseria catarrhalis by lysozyme J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74 :788-793 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 C). As negative controls, we confirmed that antibiotics that do not target the membrane, including ampicillin, rifampicin, and novobiocin, do not shift DiOC 2 (3) or TO-PRO-3 staining ( Figures S5 A–S5D). After 15 min of treatment with SCH-79797, subsequent DiOC 2 (3) and TO-PRO-3 staining revealed significant defects in both membrane polarization and permeability ( Figure 5 C). These effects on the membrane are not secondary consequences of DHFR inhibition, as trimethoprim-treated E. coli showed no significant changes in DiOC 2 (3) and TO-PRO-3 staining ( Figure 5 C). The membrane-targeting effect of SCH-79797 is also not species-specific, as similar results were seen with SCH-79797-treated B. subtilis 168 ( Figures S5 E–S5G). These findings indicate that independent of its ability to inhibit DHFR activity, SCH-79797 disrupts both membrane potential and permeability barrier.
Having established that SCH-79797 disrupts both folate metabolism and membrane integrity, we sought to determine if these two targets can together explain how SCH-79797 kills bacteria. To address this question, we used BCP analysis to compare the cell morphology of bacteria treated with SCH-79797 to that of bacteria treated with a combination of two different antibiotics, one of which targets DHFR and one of which targets membrane integrity. Qualitative inspection suggested that SCH-79797-treated E. coli appeared similar to E. coli lptD4213 cells treated with a combination of trimethoprim and nisin ( Figure 6 A). Quantification of the images confirmed that SCH-79797 clusters with the co-treatment of trimethoprim and nisin ( Figure 6 A). Co-treatment with polymyxin B and trimethoprim similarly clustered with SCH-79797, suggesting that this effect is due to membrane perturbation and not specific to the complex MoA of nisin ( Hasper et al., 2006; Prince et al., 2016; Wiedemann et al., 2001 21. Hasper, H.E. ∙ Kramer, N.E. ∙ Smith, J.L. ... An alternative bactericidal mechanism of action for lantibiotic peptides that target lipid II Science. 2006; 313 :1636-1637 Crossref Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Prince, A. ∙ Sandhu, P. ∙ Ror, P. ... Lipid-II Independent Antimicrobial Mechanism of Nisin Depends On Its Crowding And Degree Of Oligomerization Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :37908 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Wiedemann, I. ∙ Breukink, E. ∙ van Kraaij, C. ...

Chem. 2001; 276 :1772-1779 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (645) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 ). The fact that SCH-79797 clusters more closely to the co-treatments than to the individual treatments with trimethoprim or nisin/polymyxin B reinforces the conclusion that SCH-79797 kills bacteria by targeting both DHFR and the membrane. There are no other antibiotics that have been shown to target both folate metabolism and membrane integrity, indicating that SCH-79797 represents an antibiotic with a unique MoA. This result also explains why SCH-79797 failed to cluster with any of the known antibiotics in our BCP analysis ( Figure 2 B).
Combination antibiotic therapy has been suggested as a potential means of circumventing the rise of antibiotic resistance ( Tamma et al., 2012; Tyers and Wright, 2019 47. Tamma, P.D. ∙ Cosgrove, S.E. ∙ Maragakis, L.L. Combination therapy for treatment of infections with gram-negative bacteria Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2012; 25 :450-470 Crossref Scopus (587) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Tyers, M. ∙ Wright, G.D. Drug combinations: a strategy to extend the life of antibiotics in the 21st century Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :141-155 Crossref Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ) but it has remained unclear whether it is better to combine multiple activities on the same molecule. To probe this issue, we measured the synergy of co-treatment with one antibiotic targeting dihydrofolate reductase and another targeting the membrane and compared their combined effectiveness to that of SCH-79797. Interestingly, when E. coli lptD4213 cells were co-treated with trimethoprim and nisin, or co-treated with trimethoprim and polymixin B, the two antibiotics antagonized one another’s activity, resulting in a greater number of viable cells remaining after 2 h of co-treatment ( Figure 6 B). MRSA USA300 persister cells ( Kim et al., 2018 26. Kim, W. ∙ Zhu, W. ∙ Hendricks, G.L. ... A new class of synthetic retinoid antibiotics effective against bacterial persisters Nature. 2018; 556 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ) are resistant to treatment with the membrane-disrupting daptomycin ( Chen et al., 2014; Taylor and Palmer, 2016 11. Chen, Y.F. ∙ Sun, T.L. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Interaction of daptomycin with lipid bilayers: a lipid extracting effect Biochemistry. 2014; 53 :5384-5392 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Taylor, S.D. ∙ Palmer, M. The action mechanism of daptomycin Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2016; 24 :6253-6268 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treating MRSA USA300 persister cells with 63 μg/mL daptomycin (1× MIC) for 2 h did not reduce the number of CFUs remaining in the culture ( Figure 6 C). However, SCH-79797 treatment of MRSA robustly killed these persister cells while the combination of trimethoprim with either nisin or daptomycin could not ( Figure 6 C). These results suggest that the combination of two different antibacterial activities on the same molecular scaffold can, at least in the case of SCH-79797, produce a more potent antibacterial effect than co-treating with two antibiotics with the two separate targeting activities.
SCH-79797 consists of a pyrroloquinazolinediamine core that is substituted with an isopropylphenyl group on one side and a cyclopropyl moiety on the other. In order to test the function of the pyrroloquinazolinediamine core on the antibiotic activity of SCH-79797, we synthesized a derivative of SCH-79797 (Irresistin-10 or IRS-10) that lacks both side groups ( Figure 7 A). When compared to the parent molecule SCH-79797, removing the isopropylphenyl and cyclopropyl groups increased the potency against E. coli lptD4213 but decreased the potency against B. subtilis 168, MRSA USA300, and A. baumannii AB17978 ( Figure 7 B; Table S1 ). To determine whether the pyrroloquinazolinediamine core of SCH-79797 is specifically involved in targeting folate metabolism or membrane integrity, we assessed the activity of IRS-10 using the dfrA and folC CRISPRi hypersensitivity assay and the quantitative flow cytometry membrane integrity assay. The CRISPRi hypersensitivity assay indicated that IRS-10 maintains the ability to inhibit folate metabolism, suggesting that the pyrroloquinazolinediamine core is sufficient to target DHFR ( Figure 7 C). However, unlike SCH-79797, DiOC 2 (3) and TO-PRO-3 staining showed that IRS-10 does not disrupt membrane polarity or permeability ( Figure 7 D). We also confirmed that IRS-10 directly inhibits the enzymatic activity of purified E. coli FolA ( Figures 4 D and 4E). IRS-10 proved to be a more potent inhibitor of FolA than SCH-79797 (IRS-10 IC 50 = 65 ± 19 nM) ( Figure 4 D), suggesting that its increased efficacy against E. coli in cell culture can be explained by increased activity toward DHFR. Together, these findings suggest that the pyrroloquinazolinediamine core of SCH-79797 targets DHFR.
We next sought to determine if the isopropylbenzene side group is responsible for the membrane-targeting properties of SCH-79797. We thus obtained isopropylbenzene alone (also known as cumene) ( Figure S7 A) and determined its effects on membrane integrity and folate biosynthesis. DiOC 2 (3) and TO-PRO-3 staining showed that ispropylbenzene disrupts both membrane polarity and permeability ( Figure S7 B). Meanwhile, reduction of dfrA or folC levels by CRISPRi had no effect on the sensitivity of bacteria to isopropylbenzene ( Figure S7 C). These results support the conclusion that SCH-79797 is a dual-targeting compound where the pyrroloquinazolinediamine core specifically targets folate metabolism while the isopropylbenzene group specifically targets membrane integrity.
As a further test of whether the hydrophobic isopropylbenzene chain functions to target the membrane, we generated another small molecule, Irresistin-16 (IRS-16), in which we decorated the pyrroloquinazolinediamine core with a biphenyl group that is even more hydrophobic than isopropylbenzene ( Figure 7 A). As predicted from the inclusion of both folate-targeting and membrane-targeting moieties, dfrA and folC CRISPRi mutants proved hypersensitive to IRS-16 and IRS-16 disrupted membrane permeability and polarity by DiOC 2 (3) and TO-PRO-3 staining ( Figures 7 C and 7D). IRS-16 also had more potent antibiotic activity than IRS-10 against most bacteria tested ( Figure 7 B; Table S1 ), suggesting that targeting both membrane integrity and folate biosynthesis is more powerful than targeting folate metabolism alone.
An effective antibiotic needs to be able to target pathogenic bacteria without killing mammalian hosts. To determine the concentrations required to inhibit the growth of mammalian cells, we treated several mammalian cell lines with both SCH-79797 and IRS-16, the derivative with the most potent antibiotic activity. SCH-79797 showed promising results with PBMC cells, as they required more than 10-fold higher doses for growth inhibition than those required for killing E. coli lptD4213 ( Figure 7 E). However, SCH-79797 inhibited the growth of other mammalian cell lines, including HK-2, HEK293, and HLF, at doses comparable to the doses needed to kill bacteria. In contrast, IRS-16 killed bacteria at ∼100–1,000-fold lower doses than those required to affect mammalian cells in all cell lines tested ( Figure 7 E). In light of this larger therapeutic window, we focused our further in vivo analysis efforts on IRS-16.
Because IRS-16 preferentially killed bacteria in culture models, we proceeded to characterize its in vivo effects on mice. We determined the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of IRS-16 to be 15 mg/kg when administered intravenously. A pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that at this MTD, the plasma concentration of IRS-16 peaked at 1.4 μg/mL with a half-life of 15.8 h ( Figures S7 D and S7E). Consistent with this robust in vivo stability, a mouse liver microsome study showed that IRS-16 is extremely stable as compared to a control drug, verapamil ( Figure 7 F).
Finally, we determined whether IRS-16 has antibiotic activity in a mouse bacterial infection model. For this purpose, we focused on N. gonorrhoeae as it is a Gram-negative pathogen for which there is an acute need for new antibiotics due to widespread resistance toward existing drugs ( CDC, 2019 9. CDC Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019 Google Scholar ). There is also a well-validated mouse vaginal infection model for N. gonorrhoeae ( Jerse et al., 2002; Song et al., 2008 24. Jerse, A.E. ∙ Crow, E.T. ∙ Bordner, A.N. ... Growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the female mouse genital tract does not require the gonococcal transferrin or hemoglobin receptors and may be enhanced by commensal lactobacilli Infect. Immun. 2002; 70 :2549-2558 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar 44. Song, W. ∙ Condron, S. ∙ Mocca, B.T. ... Local and humoral immune responses against primary and repeat Neisseria gonorrhoeae genital tract infections of 17beta-estradiol-treated mice Vaccine. 2008; 26 :5741-5751 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). In bacterial culture, IRS-16 showed robust activity toward N. gonorrhoeae , with an MIC of 0.03 μg/mL ( Table S1 ). Our pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that IRS-16 should persist in mice at concentrations above this MIC for nearly 48 h ( Figures S7 D and S7E). To test its in vivo efficacy, we inoculated the vaginal tracts of BALB/c mice with 1.85 × 10 6 CFU/mouse of N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 700825, treated with intravenous (i.v.) doses of either 10 mg/kg IRS-16 or vehicle control at 2 and 14 h post-infection, and assayed vaginal N. gonorrhoeae CFUs at 26 h post-infection. IRS-16 significantly reduced the vaginal load of N. gonorrhoeae (p < 0.05) as compared to the vehicle control ( Figure 7 G). Consistent with its favorable therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic profile, this result confirms that IRS-16 can function as an effective antibiotic in an in vivo mouse gonorrhea infection model.

Section: Discussion

Due to the rise in resistance to known antibiotics, there is an acute need for new antibiotics with the key features of having unique MoAs, potency toward Gram-negatives, and reduced susceptibility to resistance. Here, we describe a promising compound, SCH-79797, and its derivative, IRS-16, that are effective in animals and address these key criteria with a unique dual-targeting MoA, the ability to kill both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, and an undetectably low frequency of resistance. We also describe a systems-level pipeline that combines independent orthogonal approaches to characterize the MoA of SCH-79797 in the absence of resistant mutants. Specifically, we used BCP classification to categorize the MoA of SCH-79797 as distinct from those of 37 known antibiotics ( Figure 2 B). We then used thermal proteome profiling to identify DHFR as a candidate binding partner of SCH-79797 and confirmed that SCH-79797 inhibits folate metabolism through metabolomic analysis and CRISPRi genetic hypersensitivity ( Figures 3 B, 4 B, and 4C). We confirmed that SCH-79797 directly inhibits DHFR activity by acting competitively toward its DHF substrate ( Figures 4 D and 4E). The BCP images also alerted us to a second potential target for SCH-79797, the bacterial membrane. Quantitative flow cytometry with dyes that report on membrane permeability and polarity confirmed that SCH-79797 has a folate-independent effect on bacterial membrane integrity ( Figure 5 C). Together, these assays constitute a pipeline that can be used in the future to rapidly characterize antibiotic MoAs de novo . Such a pipeline is especially important for compounds such as SCH-79797 that are not prone to resistance and do not mimic known MoAs. BCP, thermal proteome profiling, metabolomics, CRISPRi sensitivity, and flow cytometry are all assays that can be performed in small volumes, such that they can be readily scaled without the need for synthesizing large amounts of the compound in question. The orthogonal nature of the assays enables the independent identification of multiple MoAs, which may help in the discovery of unique antibiotic classes.
Both of the targets of SCH-79797 are relevant for its function as an antibiotic. The CRISPRi and metabolomic studies demonstrate that SCH-79797 actively disrupts folate metabolism in multiple bacterial species in a manner that is rate-limiting for growth ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Meanwhile, the flow cytometry assay demonstrates that SCH-79797 simultaneously disrupts membrane integrity even though folate inhibition itself has no effect on the membrane ( Figure 5 C). The ability of SCH-79797 to disrupt membrane integrity is particularly interesting given that membrane-disruptors are often selective for either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria ( Ling et al., 2015; Taylor and Palmer, 2016; Warren et al., 1957 30. Ling, L.L. ∙ Schneider, T. ∙ Peoples, A.J. ... A new antibiotic kills pathogens without detectable resistance Nature. 2015; 517 :455-459 Crossref Scopus (1813) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Taylor, S.D. ∙ Palmer, M. The action mechanism of daptomycin Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2016; 24 :6253-6268 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Warren, G.H. ∙ Gray, J. ∙ Yurchenco, J.A. Effect of polymyxin on the lysis of Neisseria catarrhalis by lysozyme J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74 :788-793 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), while SCH-79797 proved potent against both Gram-positive pathogens like S. aureus and E. faecalis as well as Gram-negative pathogens like A. baumannii , N. gonorrhoeae , and pathogenic E. coli ( Figure 1 A). Host toxicity is often a concern for membrane-targeting antibiotics, and while SCH-79797 was well tolerated by some animal cells like G. mellonella wax worms and PBMC cells, it killed other mammalian cell lines at doses similar to those at which it functions as an antibiotic. Meanwhile, IRS-16, a derivative of SCH-79797, increased antibiotic activity without increasing mammalian toxicity, thereby increasing its therapeutic window >100-fold. The ability of IRS-16 to selectively target bacteria is consistent with a recent study of retinoid derivatives that provided proof-of-principle that small molecules can preferentially target bacterial membranes ( Kim et al., 2018 26. Kim, W. ∙ Zhu, W. ∙ Hendricks, G.L. ... A new class of synthetic retinoid antibiotics effective against bacterial persisters Nature. 2018; 556 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future biophysical characterization and medicinal chemistry will help to further increase potency and reduce toxicity.
The undetectably low frequency of resistance to SCH-79797 could result from its two distinct targets. Specifically, we were successful in isolating resistance mutants for mimics of each of its two individual targets, trimethoprim and nisin, but not for SCH-79797 ( Figure 1 E). The average mutation rate in E. coli is 2.1 × 10 −7 per gene per generation ( Chen and Zhang, 2013 10. Chen, X. ∙ Zhang, J. No gene-specific optimization of mutation rate in Escherichia coli Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :1559-1562 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). If E. coli required 2 mutations to acquire resistance to SCH-79797, the number of bacteria that would be necessary to find a resistant mutant would be in the range of 10 14 . Even if that represents an overestimate, humans are estimated to carry roughly 4 × 10 13 bacteria in total, so such low frequencies of resistance would be unlikely to result in resistant mutants in a clinical context.
Our studies suggest that SCH-79797 is more potent than combination treatment with antibiotics that mimic its two activities, the DHFR-inhibitor trimethoprim and the membrane-disruptor nisin. Similarly, co-treatment with trimethoprim and polymyxin B showed antagonistic interactions ( Figure 6 B), while MRSA persister cells were killed by SCH-79797 but not by combined treatment with trimethoprim and daptomycin ( Figure 6 C). A potential explanation for the potency of SCH-79797 is that recruiting a DHFR inhibitor to the membrane could increase its effective concentration or potentiate its inactivation of DHFR by sequestering it. Permeabilizing the membrane could also enhance the access of SCH-79797 to its cytoplasmic DHFR target. The difference between SCH-79797 and the combination treatments could also be based on non-primary target effects such as differences in localized synergistic drug concentrations, drug uptake or efflux. Membrane-targeting molecules can act either synergistically or antagonistically with antibiotics with different MoAs ( Brochado et al., 2018 6. Brochado, A.R. ∙ Telzerow, A. ∙ Bobonis, J. ... Species-specific activity of antibacterial drug combinations Nature. 2018; 559 :259-263 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because trimethoprim and various membrane disruptors antagonize each other separately, but DHFR inhibition and membrane disruption synergize in the context of SCH-79797, combining antibiotic activities onto the same molecule could present a solution for bypassing this antagonistic effect. In any event, our results suggest that despite the promise of combination antibiotic therapies ( Brochado et al., 2018; Tyers and Wright, 2019 6. Brochado, A.R. ∙ Telzerow, A. ∙ Bobonis, J. ... Species-specific activity of antibacterial drug combinations Nature. 2018; 559 :259-263 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Tyers, M. ∙ Wright, G.D. Drug combinations: a strategy to extend the life of antibiotics in the 21st century Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :141-155 Crossref Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ), an even more powerful approach could be to combine different targeting moieties onto the same chemical scaffold.
Discovering the MoA of SCH-79797 also enabled us to design derivatives that improve its efficacy. Our most promising derivative currently is IRS-16, in which we replaced the isopropylphenyl group with a biphenyl group (with the idea to increase the membrane-targeting activity) and removed the cyclopropyl side chain (to enhance the DHFR inhibition). IRS-16 showed improved ability to kill bacteria, with significantly lower MICs than SCH-79797. More importantly, IRS-16 did not similarly enhance the growth inhibition of mammalian cells. Thus, IRS-16 exhibited a promising therapeutic index, as reducing the concentration necessary to kill bacteria without affecting the concentration necessary to kill mammalian cells resulted in a compound that is >100-fold more potent toward bacteria than hosts. IRS-16 was also stable in mice and tolerated at doses significantly above the MIC for several hours. Finally, we confirmed that IRS-16 significantly reduced the burden of N. gonorrhoeae in a mouse vaginal infection model. N. gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative pathogen with some of the highest rates of drug resistance for any pathogen. The acute need for new antibiotics to treat N. gonorrhoeae makes IRS-16 a particularly promising small molecule candidate for future development.

Detailed cell line information is provided in Table S1 . Mammalian cell line toxicity assays were performed by Pharmaron, Inc. (Beijing, ROC).
Care and handling of male CD-1 mice approximately 6-8 weeks old conformed to institutional animal care and use policies as carried out at Pharmaron, Inc. (Beijing, ROC).
Care and handling of 5-week old ovariectomized BALB/c mice conformed to institutional animal care and use policies as carried out at Pharmacology Discovery Services Taiwan, Ltd. (New Taipei City, TW).
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each antibiotic was defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic that resulted in no visible growth. MICs were measured by diluting overnight cultures 1:150 and then adding 2-fold dilutions of each antibiotic in 96-well plates and grown with shaking at 37°C. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the OD 600 . Assays performed by Pharmacology Discovery Services (New Taipei City, TW) and Pharmaron Inc. (Beijing, ROC) are indicated in Table S1 . For MIC measurements done in-house, OD 600 readings were measured by either a BioTek Synergy HT (Winooski, VT) or Tecan InfiniteM200 Pro (Männedorf, CH) microplate reader. In locations where drug concentrations are listed, they are included both as a relative fold change compared to the MIC for that bacterial strain and drug combination (1X MIC, 2X MIC, etc) as well as an absolute concentration (1 μg/mL, 2 μg/mL, etc).
Compounds were sourced from commercial vendors: MicrosourceDiversity, Aldrich, Selleckchem, Chiromics, and Chembridge. Each compound dissolved in DMSO at 50 μM and then was screened for antibiotic activity against E. coli lptD4213 growing in Terrific Broth. After normalizing for plate-to-plate variation, an OD 600 of half the median plate OD 600 was used as a cutoff, below which any compound was assumed to have inhibited the growth of E. coli lptD4213 and above which compounds were assumed to be ineffective. Compounds that either had not been previously identified as antibiotics or had unknown or ambiguous mechanisms of action were chosen for further investigation and their MIC’s were measured using the microdilution method described above.
All Galleria mellonella larvae were obtained from Vita-Bugs©, distributed through PetCo© (2336624, San Diego, CA), and kept in a 20°C chamber. All injections were administered using a sterile 1 mL syringe with a 27G x 0.5 in needle (BD 305109) attached to a syringe pump (KD Scientific, 78-8210) delivered at a rate of 250 μL/min into the fourth leg of the worm. Prior to injection, the site was sterilized with ethanol. A. baumannii AB17978 (10 5 CFU/larva) and drug dissolved in DMSO (SCH-79797 at 66.6 μg/larva, gentamicin at 66.6 μg/larva, merapenem at 66.6 μg/larva) were pre-mixed prior to injection. The viability of each injected larva was determined by prodding each larva with a dowel and observing whether there was subsequent movement.
Overnight E. coli lptD4213 or S. aureus MRSA USA300 cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh media and grown to mid exponential phase (OD 600 = 0.4-0.6). Each culture was then diluted 1:10 into fresh media and then treated with the indicated concentration of each antibiotic. Each time point was taken by removing 150 μL and performing 10-fold serial dilutions. Six dilutions of each condition were then plated in the absence of antibiotic and grown at 37°C overnight. Colony forming units (CFU’s) were measured by counting the resulting number of colonies the next day.
Stationary phase S. aureus cells have the same antibiotic tolerant properties of persister cells ( Kim et al., 2018 26. Kim, W. ∙ Zhu, W. ∙ Hendricks, G.L. ... A new class of synthetic retinoid antibiotics effective against bacterial persisters Nature. 2018; 556 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, overnight MRSA USA300 cultures were used to measure the effectiveness of SCH-79797 against persister cells. An overnight S. aureus MRSA USA300 culture was diluted 1:100 in PBS and then then treated with the indicated concentration of each antibiotic. After a 2 hour incubation with shaking at 37°C, 150 μL from each treatment condition was taken and 10-fold serial dilutions were performed. Six dilutions of each condition were then plated in the absence of antibiotic and grown at 37°C overnight. CFU’s were measured by counting the resulting number of colonies the next day.
MICs of two biological replicates of S. aureus MRSA USA300 or A. baumannii AB17978 were obtained against the indicated antibiotics. Cells that grew in 0.5X MIC of the indicated antibiotics were subsequently cultured in the absence of antibiotics, and the MIC was then remeasured. This is a single passage and was repeated for 5-30 passages. Cells from each passage were stored as a frozen stock. Resistance was confirmed by comparing the MICs of resistant mutants against S. aureus MRSA USA300 or A. baumannii AB17978 that had not been previously exposed to the indicated antibiotics.
Following the protocol of Nonejuie et al. (2013) 34. Nonejuie, P. ∙ Burkart, M. ∙ Pogliano, K. ... Bacterial cytological profiling rapidly identifies the cellular pathways targeted by antibacterial molecules Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :16169-16174 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar , overnight E. coli lptD4213 cultures were diluted 1:100 in LB and grown at 30°C for 90 minutes on a roller drum. Each culture was then treated with 5X the MIC and incubated at 30°C with slight agitation. Following antibiotic treatment, cells were stained with 0.5 μM SYTOX Green, 1 μg/mL FM4-64, and 2 μg/mL DAPI for incubated for 10 minutes. Each stained culture was then centrifuged at 3220 r cf. for 40 s and resuspended in 1/10 volume of LB. Cells spotted onto a 1.2% agarose pad in 20% LB medium for imaging. Images were collected on a Nikon 90i upright microscope equipped with a 100X 1.4 N.A. objective (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) and a RoleraXR (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) camera. Microscope control and image acquisition were performed in NIS Elements.
In dual-treatment experiments ( Figures 6 A and S6 ), overnight E. coli lptD4213 cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown to early-mid exponential phase (OD 600 = 0.4-0.6). Each culture was then diluted 1:10 into fresh LB and treated with the desired concentration of antibiotic for 10 minutes. Following antibiotic treatment, cells were stained with 0.5 μM SYTOX Green, 1 μg/mL FM4-64, and 2 μg/mL DAPI. Each stained culture was then spotted onto a 1.5% agar pad supplemented with casamino acids and glucose in M63 (15 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 100 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1.7 μM FeSO 4 , 0.5% glucose, 0.2% casamino acids, 1 mM MgSO 4 ). Images were collected on either Nikon 90i upright microscope equipped with a 100X 1.4 N.A. objective (Nikon) or a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a 100X 1.4 NA objective. Both microscopes utilize an Orca Flash4 camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). Microscope control and image acquisition were performed in NIS Elements (Nikon).
Following imaging, the E. coli cells were segmented ( Ursell et al., 2017 51. Ursell, T. ∙ Lee, T.K. ∙ Shiomi, D. ... Rapid, precise quantification of bacterial cellular dimensions across a genomic-scale knockout library BMC Biol. 2017; 15 :17 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) and single-cell features were extracted using custom MATLAB code (Mathworks, Natwick, MA). Clustering was performed using the single-linkage method with MANOVA ( Figure 2 , MATLAB functions manova1, manovacluster). Before applying the UMAP dimensionality reduction technique ( McInnes et al., 2018 32. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1802.03426 Google Scholar ), each of the 14 cytological features was normalized into a z-score by subtracting off the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of that feature ( Figure S2 ). Principal component analysis was performed using the prcomp function in R and clustering was performed using the single-linkage method ( Figure 6 ).
Thermal proteome profiling experiments were performed following Mateus et al. (2018) 31. Mateus, A. ∙ Bobonis, J. ∙ Kurzawa, N. ... Thermal proteome profiling in bacteria: probing protein state in vivo Mol. Syst. Biol. 2018; 14 :e8242 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar . Whole cell samples were treated with 0.6, 1.1, 2.2, 4.4 μg/mL SCH-79797 or 0.1, 0.5, 2.3, 11.6 μg/mL trimethoprim. Cell lysate samples were treated with 0.4, 1.8, 8.9, 44.4 μg/mL SCH-79797 or 0.1, 0.5, 2.3, 11.6 μg/mL trimethoprim. After heat treatment, the soluble fraction was collected, digested with trypsin and peptides were labeled with tandem mass tags ( Werner et al., 2014 54. Werner, T. ∙ Sweetman, G. ∙ Savitski, M.F. ... Ion coalescence of neutron encoded TMT 10-plex reporter ions Anal. Chem. 2014; 86 :3594-3601 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples were subjected to two-dimensional liquid chromatography and analyzed on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). While the data collected is proteome wide, three different cutoffs were used to define three classes of potential targets. The color of the point indicates the signal maximal effect size across all temperatures and the largest change in abundance across all concentrations was selected for continued analysis (Dots, Figure 3 .) A mild effect indicates at least one temperature had a change in abundance of at least 25% in both whole cell and cell lysate treatments (Triangles, Figure 3 ) Proteins that had a change in abundance of at least 25% at three or more temperatures (Squares, Figure 3 ). To be considered a consistent effect, the change in abundance of the protein had to show the same sign at least 90% of the time and have an effect size of at least 1 (2-fold) in either whole cells or cell lysates.
Overnight E. coli NCM3722 cultures were grown and diluted 1:100 in Gutnick Minimal Media and grown to early-mid exponential phase (OD 600 = 0.4-0.6). Cultures were treated with either 13.9 μg/mL SCH-79797 (1X MIC) or 0.15 μg/mL trimethoprim (1X MIC) for 15 minutes. Folates were extracted by vacuum filtering 15 mL of treated cells using 0.45 μm HNWP Millipore nylon membranes and immediately placing filters into an ice-cold quenching solution containing 40:40:20 Methanol:acetonitrile:25 mM NH 4 OAc + 0.1% sodium Ascorbic in HPLC grade water. The resulting solution was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1.5 min at 4°C and the supernatant saved for mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed as described in Chen et al. (2017) 12. Chen, L. ∙ Ducker, G.S. ∙ Lu, W. ... An LC-MS chemical derivatization method for the measurement of five different one-carbon states of cellular tetrahydrofolate Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2017; 409 :5955-5964 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar .
E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (FolA) was purified by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ). The enzymatic activity of FolA was measured using a colorimetric dihydrofolate reductase assay kit (Sigma CS0340) using a QuantaMaster 40 Spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International Inc., Edison, NJ). The kit measures FolA activity by monitoring the change in sample absorbance at 340 nm due to FolA-dependent NADPH consumption. For each condition, 1 μL purified enzyme in storage buffer (1X PBS, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) was thawed on ice and added to 1000 μL 1X assay buffer immediately before assaying. After mixing the reaction components together, the 100 μL reaction volume was pipetted into a 1 mM pathlength quartz cuvette and the transmitted light intensity at 340 nm was measured for 100 s at 1 kHz sampling. These high frequency readings were downsampled by averaging to 1 Hz and the activity of each sample was calculated from the slope (β) a linear regression of the log transformed intensity measurements using MATLAB. Because the enzyme was only moderately stable in assay buffer (half-time ∼20 minutes), all enzymatic measurements were normalized to a standard condition (60 μM NADPH and 100 μM DHF) that was measured immediately before the sample of interest. The relative activity was calculated from (β sample – β noEnzyme )/(β standard – β noEnzyme ).
Overnight E. coli lptD4213 and B. subtilis 168 cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown to early-mid exponential phase (OD 600 = 0.4-0.6) at 37°C. Each culture was then diluted 1:10 into PBS and treated with the desired concentration of antibiotic for 15 minutes. Cells were then stained with the BacLight Bacterial Membrane Potential kit (ThermoFisher B34950). This kit uses DiOC2(3) to measure a cell’s membrane potential as a ratio of green (488 nm ex, 525/50 nm em) to red (488 nm ex, 610/20 nm em) ( Novo et al., 1999 35. Novo, D. ∙ Perlmutter, N.G. ∙ Hunt, R.H. ... Accurate flow cytometric membrane potential measurement in bacteria using diethyloxacarbocyanine and a ratiometric technique Cytometry. 1999; 35 :55-63 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Membrane integrity was measured by staining cells with TO-PRO-3, a dye that is excluded from cells with an intact membrane (640 nm ex, 670/30 nm em). The LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) at the Flow Cytometry Resource Facility, Princeton University, was used to measure the fluorescent intensities of both dyes in response to antibiotic treatment. 100,000 events were recorded for each data file. Data was analyzed using FlowJo v10 software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR).
In a white, opaque, 384-well plate, either HEK293 (500 cells/well), HK-2 (500 cells/well), HLF cells (500 cells/well) or PBMC (3000 cells/well) cells were seeded overnight. After 24 hours, DMSO or compounds were added in 3-fold dilutions and incubated for 72 hours. CyQUANT Detection Reagent was added in equal volume and incubated for 1 hour. Fluorescence was read from the bottom of plate with standard green filter set (508/527 nm ex). Cell toxicity was evaluated by Pharmaron, Inc. (Beijing, ROC).
The metabolic stability of IRS-16 was tested in mouse liver microsomes with NADPH and UDPGA over a period of 1 hour. IRS-16 (2 μM) and Verapamil (2 μM, positive control) were added to 0.5 mg/mL microsomes. Aliquots of 50 μL were taken from the reaction solution at 0.5, 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 volumes of cold acetonitrile with IS (100 nM alprazolam, 200 nM caffeine, and 100 nM tolbutamide). Samples were centrifuged at 3,220xg for 40 minutes. Aliquots of 100 μL of the supernatant were mixed with 100 μL of ultra-pure H 2 O and then used for LC-MS/MS analysis. Mouse liver microsomal stability was evaluated by Pharmaron, Inc. (Beijing, ROC).
6-8 week old male CD-1 mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of IRS-16 at 15 mg/kg in 5% DMSO + 95% (20% HP-β-CD in water, W/V) and showed no adverse effects. Plasma measurements were averaged from 2 mice at the indicated time points following administration. Concentration was determined by LC/MS. Pharmacokinetic assay was performed by Pharmaron, Inc. (Beijing, ROC).
Groups of 5 ovariectomized BALB/c mice 5 weeks of age were used. Animals were subcutaneously injected with a water soluble form of estradiol at 0.23 mg/mouse on day −2, 0, 2, 4 and 6.Starting from day −2, and following inoculation to the study end, mice were dosed twice daily with streptomycin (1.2 mg/mouse) and vancomycin (0.6 mg/mouse) by IP injection to minimize the vaginal flora. Trimethoprim sulfate (0.04 g/100 mL) was administered in drinking water. At day 0, mice were anesthetized by ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) through IP injection, and then inoculated intravaginally with 1.0-2.0 × 10 6 CFU of N. gonorrhoeae (FA1090, ATCC 700825). Before inoculation, the mouse vagina was first rinsed with 30 μL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) followed by inoculation with 20 μL gonococci suspension in PBS containing 0.5 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 . IRS-16 or vehicle were administered 2 h and 12 h after inoculation. Mice are euthanized with CO 2 asphyxiation after 2 h and 24 h. Lavage was performed with 400 μL GC broth containing 0.05% saponin to recover vaginal bacteria. The bacterial suspensions were plated onto chocolate agar to determine the N. gonorrhoeae counts. N. gonorrhoeae vaginal infection model was performed by Pharmacology Discovery Services (New Taipei City, TW).
For all assays except the Neisseria gonorrhea vaginal infection model, we use the arithmetic mean and standard deviation across multiple biological replicates as our measures of center and spread. The particular numbers of replicates for each experiment type are included in the respective figure legends. For the Neisseria gonorrhea vaginal infection model, we display median, Q1, Q3, and the values for each of the five individual mice in each sample cohort are ( Figure 7 G).
Statistical significance for Galleria mellonella killing assays were determined from Mantel-Cox test using Prism 8.1.2 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Each of three independent cohorts started with twelve animals. p values can be found in Table S2 . For the Neisseria gonorrhea vaginal infection model, significance (p < 0.05) was determined from a one-factor ANOVA.
Hierarchical-clustering of the cytological features was performed using the single-linkage method with MANOVA ( Figure 2 , MATLAB functions manova1, manovacluster). Before applying the UMAP dimensionality reduction technique ( McInnes et al., 2018 32. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1802.03426 Google Scholar ), each of the 14 cytological features was normalized into a z-score by subtracting off the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of that feature ( Figure S2 ). Principal component analysis was performed using the prcomp function in R and clustering was performed using the single-linkage method ( Figure 6 ). Details of the dimensionality reduction technique and hierarchical clustering method are included in the respective figure legends.
While the data collected is proteome wide, three different cutoffs were used to define three classes of potential targets. The color of the point indicates the signal maximal effect size across all temperatures (nTemp = 10) and the largest change in abundance across all concentrations (nConc = 4) was selected for continued analysis (Dots, Figure 3 .) A mild effect indicates at least one temperature had a change in abundance of at least 25% in both whole cell and cell lysate treatments (Triangles, Figure 3 ) Proteins that had a change in abundance of at least 25% at three or more temperatures (Squares, Figure 3 ). To be considered a consistent effect, the change in abundance of the protein had to show the same sign at least 90% of the time and have an effect size of at least 1 (2-fold) in either whole cells or cell lysates. The details for these symbols and cutoffs are included in the respective figure legend.
100,000 events were recorded for each flow cytometry sample and analyzed using FloJo v10. Gates used to quantify the fraction of events with depolarized or permeabilized membranes were determined from control samples treated with CCCP or nisin respectively. These details are included in the respective figure legends ( Figures 5 C, 7 D, S5 , and S7 B).
Plasma measurements were averaged from 2 mice at the indicated time points following administration. After the rapid initial approach to pseudoequilibrium, filled data symbols were used as the input for terminal half-life determination ( Figure S7 D). Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated of a non-compartmental model of IRS-16 serum levels ( Figure S7 D). These details are included in the respective figure legends.
