Title: Structural Mechanism for GSDMD Targeting by Autoprocessed Caspases in Pyroptosis


Abstract: Summary

The pyroptosis execution protein GSDMD is cleaved by inflammasome-activated caspase-1 and LPS-activated caspase-11/4/5. The cleavage unmasks the pore-forming domain from GSDMD-C-terminal domain. How the caspases recognize GSDMD and its connection with caspase activation are unknown. Here, we show site-specific caspase-4/11 autoprocessing, generating a p10 product, is required and sufficient for cleaving GSDMD and inducing pyroptosis. The p10-form autoprocessed caspase-4/11 binds the GSDMD-C domain with a high affinity. Structural comparison of autoprocessed and unprocessed capase-11 identifies a β sheet induced by the autoprocessing. In caspase-4/11-GSDMD-C complex crystal structures, the β sheet organizes a hydrophobic GSDMD-binding interface that is only possible for p10-form caspase-4/11. The binding promotes dimerization-mediated caspase activation, rendering a cleavage independently of the cleavage-site tetrapeptide sequence. Crystal structure of caspase-1-GSDMD-C complex shows a similar GSDMD-recognition mode. Our study reveals an unprecedented substrate-targeting mechanism for caspases. The hydrophobic interface suggests an additional space for developing inhibitors specific for pyroptotic caspases.

Section: Introduction

Pyroptosis is a lytic cell death induced by pathogen infection or endogenous challenge ( Broz and Dixit, 2016; Jorgensen and Miao, 2015; Rathinam et al., 2019 6. Broz, P. ∙ Dixit, V.M.

Innate immunity to intracellular LPS Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :527-533 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pyroptosis triggers strong inflammation by releasing inflammatory cytokines and danger molecules. Excessive pyroptosis causes various inflammatory diseases like sepsis ( Man et al., 2017; Manthiram et al., 2017; Swanson et al., 2019 37. Man, S.M. ∙ Karki, R. ∙ Kanneganti, T.D.

Cookson, B.T. ∙ Brennan, M.A. Pro-inflammatory programmed cell death Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9 :113-114 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Caspase-1 is activated by inflammasomes, a cytosolic immune surveillance device. Murine caspase-11 and human caspase-4/5 also induce pyroptosis upon activation by intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which occurs prevalently in non-monocytes ( Hagar et al., 2013; Kayagaki et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2014 21.

Inflammatory caspases are innate immune receptors for intracellular LPS Nature. 2014; 514 :187-192 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Caspase-1/4/5/11 cleave gasdermin D (GSDMD) at the 272 FLTD 275 site ( 273 LLSD 276 for mouse GSDMD) to induce pyroptosis ( Kayagaki et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015 28.

The cleavage removes the inhibitory GSDMD-C domain and unleashes the pore-forming GSDMD-N domain to cause membrane lysis ( Aglietti et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Sborgi et al., 2016 2.

GSDMD belongs to a gasdermin family that also includes GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDME, and DFNB59 ( Broz et al., 2019 8. Broz, P. ∙ Pelegrín, P. ∙ Shao, F. The gasdermins, a protein family executing cell death and inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; Published online November 5, 2019 Crossref Scopus (938) PubMed Google Scholar ). All gasdermins except DFNB59 have the similar two-domain structure with their N domains capable of inducing pyroptosis ( Ding et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2015 15. Ding, J. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Liu, W. ...

Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases determines pyroptotic cell death Nature. 2015; 526 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (4209) PubMed Google Scholar ). GSDME, silenced in most cancers, is cleaved by caspase-3 also in the inter-domain linker ( Rogers et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017 48. Rogers, C. ∙ Fernandes-Alnemri, T. ∙ Mayes, L. ...

Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin Nature. 2017; 547 :99-103 Crossref Scopus (1939) PubMed Google Scholar ); the resulting pyroptosis underlies the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs ( Wang et al., 2017 63. Wang, Y. ∙ Gao, W. ∙ Shi, X. ... Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin Nature. 2017; 547 :99-103 Crossref Scopus (1939) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the death execution activity of the gasdermin family, pyroptosis is redefined as gasdermin-mediated programmed necrosis ( Galluzzi et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017 19. Galluzzi, L. ∙ Vitale, I. ∙ Aaronson, S.A. ...

Caspase-1 is the first caspase identified, owing to its activity of cleaving pro-interleukin (IL)-1β into mature IL-1β ( Cerretti et al., 1992; Thornberry et al., 1992 10. Cerretti, D.P. ∙ Kozlosky, C.J. ∙ Mosley, B. ... Molecular cloning of the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme Science. 1992; 256 :97-100 Crossref Scopus (1063) PubMed Google Scholar 60.

A novel heterodimeric cysteine protease is required for interleukin-1 beta processing in monocytes Nature. 1992; 356 :768-774 Crossref Scopus (2352) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the cloning of a caspase in apoptosis ( Yuan et al., 1993 68. Yuan, J. ∙ Shaham, S. ∙ Ledoux, S. ... The C. elegans cell death gene ced-3 encodes a protein similar to mammalian interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme Cell. 1993; 75 :641-652 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2327) PubMed Google Scholar ), caspases have been analyzed extensively, but mainly in apoptosis researches. All caspases have a conserved protease domain divided into a p20 and a p10 subunit; initiator caspases like caspase-1/8/9 bear additional caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) or other death-fold domain(s). Caspases are synthesized as zymogens and their activation requires cleavage between the p20 and the p10. Initiator caspases are activated by autocleavage upon upstream signal-induced dimerization ( Salvesen and Dixit, 1999 52. Salvesen, G.S. ∙ Dixit, V.M. Caspase activation: the induced-proximity model Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :10964-10967 Crossref Scopus (796) PubMed Google Scholar ). The downstream caspase-3/6/7 are intrinsic dimers but their activation also requires cleavage between the p20 and the p10 to adopt an active conformation ( Boatright and Salvesen, 2003; Riedl and Shi, 2004 3. Boatright, K.M. ∙ Salvesen, G.S. Mechanisms of caspase activation Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15 :725-731 Crossref Scopus (1140) PubMed Google Scholar 47. Riedl, S.J. ∙ Shi, Y. Molecular mechanisms of caspase regulation during apoptosis Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5 :897-907 Crossref Scopus (1647) PubMed Google Scholar ). Caspases generally recognize a tetrapeptide motif (XXXD) in the substrate and cleave after the aspartate ( Crawford and Wells, 2011; Poreba et al., 2013 13. Crawford, E.D. ∙ Wells, J.A. Caspase substrates and cellular remodeling Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80 :1055-1087 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Poreba, M. ∙ Strózyk, A. ∙ Salvesen, G.S. ... Caspase substrates and inhibitors Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a008680 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peptide substrate profiling has established the tetrapeptide sequence preferred by each caspase. Caspase-1/4/11 prefer an aromatic residue at the P4 position ( Crawford and Wells, 2011; Poreba et al., 2013; Timmer and Salvesen, 2007 13. Crawford, E.D. ∙ Wells, J.A. Caspase substrates and cellular remodeling Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80 :1055-1087 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Poreba, M. ∙ Strózyk, A. ∙ Salvesen, G.S. ... Caspase substrates and inhibitors Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a008680 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Timmer, J.C. ∙ Salvesen, G.S. Caspase substrates Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14 :66-72 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ), and WEHD-AFC is their most favorite peptidyl substrate ( Ramirez et al., 2018 43. Ramirez, M.L.G. ∙ Poreba, M. ∙ Snipas, S.J. ... Extensive peptide and natural protein substrate screens reveal that mouse caspase-11 has much narrower substrate specificity than caspase-1 J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :7058-7067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we found that autocleavage specifically at Asp289/Asp285 in caspase-4/11, generating a p10, is critical for cleaving GSDMD and inducing pyroptosis. The p10-form active caspase-4/11 binds the GSDMD-C domain to execute a tetrapeptide sequence-independent cleavage. Crystal structures of caspase-11 alone or in complex with GSDMD reveal an exosite in the autoprocessed caspase-11 that mediates high-affinity binding to GSDMD. Structures of caspase-4-GSDMD and caspase-1-GSDMD complexes highlight the conservation of this unprecedented substrate-targeting mechanism for caspases.

Section: Results

To confirm site-specific cleavage of GSDMD by caspase-1/4/11 and facilitate detection of pyroptosis, we developed cleavage-specific anti-GSDMD antibodies. For mGSDMD, we obtained a monoclone using a peptide antigen corresponding to the N terminus of the mGSDMD-C product from caspase-1/11 cleavage. As expected, this anti-cleaved mGSDMD-C antibody specifically recognized the mGSDMD-C fragment in the in vitro cleavage reaction by caspase-1, -4, or -11 ( Figure S1 A). In LPS-transfected mouse bone-derived marrow macrophages (BMDMs), or the NAIP2-NLRC4 inflammasome agonist BsaK-stimulated BMDMs, or LPS-transfected mouse AML-12 hepatocytes, the antibody also selectively reacted with mGSDMD-C but not full-length mGSDMD and mGSDMD-N ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Notably, mGSDMD-C could be detected in the supernatants, indicating its release from pyroptotic cells. The antibody did not recognize caspase-3-cleaved mGSDME in actinomycin D (ActD)-treated mouse CT26 colon cancer cells ( Wang et al., 2017 63. Wang, Y. ∙ Gao, W. ∙ Shi, X. ... Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin Nature. 2017; 547 :99-103 Crossref Scopus (1939) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B). This anti-cleaved mGSDMD-C antibody also gave a strong immunocytochemistry signal in the LPS-transfected AML-12 cells ( Figure 1 C).
For human GSDMD, we obtained a monoclone recognizing the FLTD motif at the C terminus of the GSDMD-N product. This anti-cleaved GSDMD-N (anti-cGSDMD-N) antibody selectively blotted GSDMD-N in the in vitro cleavage reaction ( Figure S1 A). Similarly, only GSDMD-N, but not full-length GSDMD and GSDMD-C, was detected by anti-cGSDMD-N immunoblotting in LPS-transfected or the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome agonist PrgI-stimulated THP1 cells ( Figure 1 D). The antibody was also inert in recognizing caspase-3-cleaved GSDME ( Figure 1 D). Unlike GSDMD-C that was released from the pyroptotic cells, GSDMD-N was barely detected in the supernatants but only in cell lysates ( Figure 1 D). Anti-cGSDMD-N immunofluorescence confirmed aggregation of GSDMD-N on the plasma membrane of PrgI-stimulated THP1 cells ( Figure 1 E). The antibody gave a specific immunocytochemistry signal in U937 cells or human GSDMD-complemented Gsdmd −/− immortalized BMDM (iBMDM) stimulated by cytoplasmic LPS or BsaK, respectively ( Figures S1 B and S1C). The staining signal in iBMDMs disappeared when FLTD in GSDMD was replaced with AAAD ( Figure S1 C). GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis plays a critical role in alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( Khanova et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018 29. Khanova, E. ∙ Wu, R. ∙ Wang, W. ... Pyroptosis by caspase11/4-gasdermin-D pathway in alcoholic hepatitis in mice and patients Hepatology. 2018; 67 :1737-1753 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Xu, B. ∙ Jiang, M. ∙ Chu, Y. ... Gasdermin D plays a key role as a pyroptosis executor of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in humans and mice J. Hepatol. 2018; 68 :773-782 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). A robust anti-cGSDMD-N immunohistochemistry signal was detected in liver samples derived from cirrhosis or liver failure patients ( Figure 1 F). These cleavage-specific anti-GSDMD antibodies are valuable tools for probing caspase-1, -4, and -11-induced pyroptosis both in vitro and in vivo .
Inflammasome activation is routinely assayed by immunoblotting of caspase-1 autoprocessing. For caspase-11, its autoprocessing was inconsistently observed in initial studies ( Casson et al., 2015; Hagar et al., 2013; Kajiwara et al., 2014; Kayagaki et al., 2011, 2013; Shi et al., 2014 9.

Inflammatory caspases are innate immune receptors for intracellular LPS Nature. 2014; 514 :187-192 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although two recent reports suggest that caspase-11 is autoprocessed at Asp285 to cleave GSDMD and induce pyroptosis ( Lee et al., 2018b; Ross et al., 2018 32. Lee, B.L. ∙ Stowe, I.B. ∙ Gupta, A. ... Caspase-11 auto-proteolysis is crucial for noncanonical inflammasome activation J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :2279-2288 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Ross, C. ∙ Chan, A.H. ∙ Von Pein, J. ... Dimerization and auto-processing induce caspase-11 protease activation within the non-canonical inflammasome Life Sci Alliance. 2018; 1 :e201800237 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is not known whether there are other important autoprocessing sites, and the situation for caspase-4 is unclear. We found that caspase-4 purified from insect cells ( Shi et al., 2014 56. Shi, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Inflammatory caspases are innate immune receptors for intracellular LPS Nature. 2014; 514 :187-192 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) was processed into p31, p24, p12, and p10 upon activation by LPS ( Figure 2 A). The four fragments arose from three cleavages at Asp59, Asp270, and Asp289, revealed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry ( Figure 2 B). Asp289 and Asp59 are conserved in caspase-11 (numbered Asp285 and Asp59, respectively), and Asp270 is substituted with a glutamate. Cleavage at Asp59, also reported in the recent study ( Lee et al., 2018b 32. Lee, B.L. ∙ Stowe, I.B. ∙ Gupta, A. ... Caspase-11 auto-proteolysis is crucial for noncanonical inflammasome activation J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :2279-2288 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), was dispensable for both caspase-4 and -11 to cleave GSDMD and induce pyroptosis ( Figure 2 C and 2D). Using an antibody recognizing an N-terminal region in the CARD of caspase-4, we only detected the Asp270-processed p31 in LPS-transfected HeLa, THP1, HL60, or HT29 cells, which presented in the supernatants but not cell lysates ( Figure 2 E). The same observation was recorded in Salmonella typhimurium-infected human A431 epidermoid cells ( Figure 2 F). Notably, caspase-4 D270A was fully functional in mediating LPS transfection or S. typhimurium-induced GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis in HeLa cells ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Under this condition, the p31 fragment disappeared, but the Asp289-cleaved p33 appeared ( Figure 2 G). Purified caspase-4 D270A, when activated by LPS, was also processed at Asp289 into p33 and p10 (p33 was further cleaved at Asp59 to form p26) ( Figure 2 I). Unlike caspase-4 D270A, the D289A mutant, which was still cleaved at Asp270, failed to mediate LPS or S. typhimurium-induced GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Our analyses, together with the recent studies ( Lee et al., 2018b; Ross et al., 2018 32. Lee, B.L. ∙ Stowe, I.B. ∙ Gupta, A. ... Caspase-11 auto-proteolysis is crucial for noncanonical inflammasome activation J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :2279-2288 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Ross, C. ∙ Chan, A.H. ∙ Von Pein, J. ... Dimerization and auto-processing induce caspase-11 protease activation within the non-canonical inflammasome Life Sci Alliance. 2018; 1 :e201800237 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), establish that Asp289/285 in caspase-4/11 is the only autoprocessing site critical for its activation to induce pyroptosis.
We then researched the connection between autoproteolysis-dependent caspase-4/11 activation and their targeting of GSDMD. In 293T cells, the Asp289-processed p33/p10-form but not full-length caspase-4 (C258A) was readily co-immunoprecipitated with GSDMD, but not GSDMA ( Figure 3 A). Similar results were obtained with mGSDMD and caspase-11, for which the p33/10 form was generated from an engineered caspase-11 bearing a TEV protease cleavage site preceding Asp285 (because p10 alone could not be expressed) ( Figure S2 A). Purified caspase-4 p33/p10 (C258A) eluted as a stable complex with GSDMD from the gel-filtration column, which was not observed with full-length caspase-4 (p43) ( Figure S2 B). Upon LPS binding, caspase-4 p33/p10 became a high-order oligomer ( Shi et al., 2014 56. Shi, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Inflammatory caspases are innate immune receptors for intracellular LPS Nature. 2014; 514 :187-192 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), which still co-eluted with GSDMD. Thus, autoprocessing at Asp289/285 allows caspase-4/11 to bind tightly to GSDMD.
The dogma is that all caspases recognize the cleavage-site tetrapeptide in the substrate ( Crawford and Wells, 2011; Poreba et al., 2013 13. Crawford, E.D. ∙ Wells, J.A. Caspase substrates and cellular remodeling Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80 :1055-1087 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Poreba, M. ∙ Strózyk, A. ∙ Salvesen, G.S. ... Caspase substrates and inhibitors Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a008680 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent study shows that the p20/p10 form of caspase-11 C254A can bind mGSDMD as well as the derived tetrapeptide LLSD, and it was thus assumed that the tetrapeptide mediates GSDMD recognition by caspase-11 ( Yang et al., 2018 67. Yang, J. ∙ Liu, Z. ∙ Wang, C. ... Mechanism of gasdermin D recognition by inflammatory caspases and their inhibition by a gasdermin D-derived peptide inhibitor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :6792-6797 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, mutation of 272 FLTD 275 in GSDMD into AAAD or FLTA (D275A) did not affect the co-immunoprecipitation with caspase-4 p33/p10 ( Figure 3 B). Unlike the D275A mutant, GSDMD-AAAD fully restored LPS-induced pyroptosis in GSDMD −/− HeLa cells and showed intact cleavage by endogenous caspase-4 ( Figure 3 C). The cleavage product of GSDMD-AAAD resisted detection by the anti-cGSDMD-N antibody due to loss of the antibody epitope. Identical results were obtained with the equivalent AAAD mutant of mGSDMD ( Figure 3 D). Recombinant GSDMD-AAAD was readily cleaved by LPS-activated caspase-4 or -11 in vitro , and the efficiency was indistinguishable from that of wild-type (WT) GSDMD ( Figures 3 E, 3F, S2 C, and S2D). Thus, the tetrapeptide in GSDMD contributes little to its recognition by caspase-4/11.
To reveal the mechanism by which GSDMD is recognized by autoprocessed caspase-1/11, a series of chimeric proteins between GSDMD and GSDME or an unrelated protein ( Figure S3 A) were assayed. Replacing the N-terminal domain of GSDMD with that of GSDME did not affect the co-immunoprecipitation by caspase-4 p33/p10 C258A ( Figure 4 A). This chimera-1 or chimera-1 ∗ (for the similarly engineered mGSDMD) protein was cleaved identically as WT GSDMD by LPS-activated caspase-4/11 in HeLa or iBMDM cells ( Figures 4 B and S3 B). Assaying of these cleavages was facilitated by the cleavage-specific anti-GSDMD antibodies ( Figure 4 B and S3 B). Replacing the GSDMD-C, but not the GSDMD-N, domain with mCherry (chimera-2 and -3, respectively) blocked caspase-4 cleavage in LPS-transfected HeLa cells ( Figure S3 C). In the in vitro assay, chimera-4, in which the GSDMD-N domain was substituted with the GST protein, was cleaved as efficiently as WT GSDMD by active caspase-4 or -11 ( Figures 4 C and S3 D). On the GSDME background, replacing its cleavage site-bearing linker with that of GSDMD (chimera-5) did not cause cleavage by caspase-4 in HeLa cells, but substitution of the GSDME-C domain with GSDMD-C (chimera-6) was sufficient to gain cleavage ( Figure 4 D). The fact that chimera-6 retains the GSDME linker confirms that caspase-4/11 do not require a specific tetrapeptide sequence at the cleavage site.
GSDMD-C alone was sufficient to precipitate caspase-4 or caspase-11 p33/p10 from 293T cells with an efficiency comparable to that of full-length GSDMD ( Figures 4 A and S2 A). Purified GSDMD-C long (residues 265–484) co-eluted with caspase-4 p33/p10 (but not the intact full-length caspase-4) from the gel-filtration column ( Figure S3 E). Consistent with the fact that the CARD is not involved in substrate recognition, the CARD-minus p22/p10 form of caspase-4 or -11 formed a stable complex with GSDMD-C long or GSDMD-C ( Figures 4 E and S3 F). The binding affinity between GSDMD-C and p22/p10 was ∼1.6 μM for caspase-4 and 0.57 μM for caspase-11 ( Figure 4 F). The intact protease domains of caspase-4/11 (the p32 form) showed no binding to GSDMD-C ( Figures 4 E, 4F, and S3 F). Thus, the GSDMD-C domain mediates high-affinity binding to autoprocessed caspase-4/11, allowing cleavage in the inter-domain linker.
We have shown that autoprocessing at Asp270 in caspase-4 is neither sufficient nor required for inducing pyroptosis. Accordingly, the corresponding p31/p12 form of caspase-4, like unprocessed full-length caspase-4, resisted co-immunoprecipitation by GSDMD in 293T cells ( Figure 3 A) and failed to form a complex with GSDMD or GSDMD-C in vitro ( Figures S2 B and S3 E). Further, neither the p31/p12 nor the full-length form of caspase-4, obtained by incubating purified caspase-4 D289A or D270A/D289A mutant with LPS, respectively, could cleave GSDMD, whereas caspase-4 p33/p10, generated from LPS incubation with the D270A mutant, readily cleaved GSDMD ( Figure 5 A). The CARD-minus p12 forms of caspase-4 or -11 also resembled their unprocessed counterparts (p32) and were defective in binding and cleaving GSDMD ( Figures 4 E, 4F, 5 B, and S3 F). In contrast, the corresponding p10 versions of the two caspases (either p20/p10 or p22/p10) were fully active ( Figure 5 B). Thus, the p12 form of Asp270-processed caspase-4, in contrast to the Asp289/285-processed p10 form of caspase-4/11, is inactive and even can not bind GSDMD.
To understand why caspase-4/11 have to be processed at the specific site, we determined crystal structures of caspase-11 (C254A) protease domain in the three different forms, unprocessed p32, p22/p10, and p20/p12 (separated between Glu266 and Ser267), at the resolutions of 2.6 Å, 2.1 Å, and 1.9 Å, respectively ( Figures 5 C–5E; Table S1 ). As expected, all the three forms of caspase-11 adopt a dimeric structure, and the monomers share a central six-stranded β sheet flanked by five helices ( Figures 5 C–5E). A short β-hairpin (βI/βII) and the N-terminal α1 are situated at the top and the bottom of the β sheet, respectively. Two monomers are arranged antiparallel with their β sheets combined into an extended twelve-stranded β sheet ( Figures 5 C–5E). The three structures differ mainly in three loops (L2, L3, and L4). The long flexible L2, largely missing in the p32 structure, is separated into L2 at the C terminus of p20 and L2′ at the N terminus of p10 in both p22/p10 and p20/p12 structures. The N- and the C-terminal regions of L2 in the p22/p10 structure, linked by a disordered region, are folded into βIII and βIV, respectively, the latter of which is missing in the p20/p12 structure ( Figure 5 D and 5E). L2′ bears a β strand (βIII′), and in the p20/p12 structure its extra N terminus is a loop extending from the missing βIV. The L3 in the p32 structure is reorganized into βV and βVI in both p22/p10 and p20/p12 structures. L4, which is not modeled in p32, has a fixed conformation in the two processed caspase-11 structures.
In the p22/p10 structure, the catalytic pocket assumes an active state, resembling that of active caspase-1 ( Wilson et al., 1994 64. Wilson, K.P. ∙ Black, J.A. ∙ Thomson, J.A. ... Structure and mechanism of interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme Nature. 1994; 370 :270-275 Crossref Scopus (782) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 F). This results from movement of the N terminus of L2 (bearing the catalytic Cys254) and reorganization of L3, the latter of which is responsible for binding the tetrapeptide ( Figure 5 F). Notably, the C-terminal part of L2, ending with the 282 MEAD 285 autoprocessing site, folds back toward the catalytic pocket. In addition, βIII extends outward and forms an antiparallel β sheet with βIII′ from the dimer partner. This βIII/βIII′ sheet, supported by the nearby L4, lies at the dimer interface to strengthen the dimer assembly ( Figure 5 D). The p20/p12 structure is highly similar to that of p22/p10 with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.338 Å. The only difference is that the much shorter L2 now ends with βIII, and the rest of sequences including 282 MEAD 285 could not be modeled, but shall be integrated to the N terminus of L2′ in p12. This difference underlies the incompetency of the p12 forms of caspase-4/11 for GSDMD binding (see below).
Consistent with structures of the catalytic pocket described above, caspase-4 p20/p12, p20/p10, and p22/p10, but not p32, showed evident and comparable activity toward the most suitable peptidyl substrate WEHD-AFC ( Ramirez et al., 2018; Roschitzki-Voser et al., 2012 43. Ramirez, M.L.G. ∙ Poreba, M. ∙ Snipas, S.J. ... Extensive peptide and natural protein substrate screens reveal that mouse caspase-11 has much narrower substrate specificity than caspase-1 J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :7058-7067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Roschitzki-Voser, H. ∙ Schroeder, T. ∙ Lenherr, E.D. ... Human caspases in vitro: expression, purification and kinetic characterization Protein Expr. Purif. 2012; 84 :236-246 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 G). Surprisingly, the three forms of caspase-4 all showed little activity toward the GSDMD-derived substrate NFLTD-AFC ( Figure 5 H). This explains why the tetrapeptide in GSDMD is unable to render productive recognition by the caspases.
We further solved crystal structure of caspase-11 (C254A) p22/p10 in complex with mGSDMD-C long (starting from residue 266) at 3.35-Å resolution ( Table S1 ). In the structure, a caspase dimer binds two mGSDMD-C long molecules ( Figure 6 A), and eight such 2:2 complexes form one asymmetric unit. Structure of caspase-11 p22/p10 in the GSDMD complex is identical to that of the apo-form ( Figure S4 A). The core structure of mGSDMD-C in the caspase-11 complex, starting from the first helix (begin with Asp288), is also not different from mGSDMD-C alone structures ( Kuang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018 30. Kuang, S. ∙ Zheng, J. ∙ Yang, H. ... Structure insight of GSDMD reveals the basis of GSDMD autoinhibition in cell pyroptosis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10642-10647 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Liu, Z. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Rathkey, J.K. ... Structures of the Gasdermin D C-Terminal Domains Reveal Mechanisms of Autoinhibition Structure. 2018; 26 :778-784 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 B). Like in apo-mGSDMD-C structures ( Liu et al., 2018 34. Liu, Z. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Rathkey, J.K. ... Structures of the Gasdermin D C-Terminal Domains Reveal Mechanisms of Autoinhibition Structure. 2018; 26 :778-784 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), residues preceding Asp288 in caspase-11-bound mGSDMD-C are largely missing ( Figure S4 B). The two mGSDMD-C long molecules, nearly symmetrically located at two sides of the caspase-11 dimer interface, bind the caspase identically ( Figure 6 A). The binding is mainly mediated by the βIII/βIII′ sheet of capase-11 dimer. Close inspection of the binding interface reveals two crucial residues, Trp263 in βIII and Val287 in βIII′, that bundle together with their side chains inserted into a hydrophobic groove formed by Leu306, Leu310, Val367, and Leu370 of mGSDMD-C ( Figure 6 B, upper). The hydrophobic interaction is strengthened by two nearby hydrogen bonds, one between Arg265 in βIII of p22 and Glu309 in mGSDMD-C and the other between Arg243 from the partner p22 and Glu307 from mGSDMD-C.
We also determined 3.6-Å crystal structure of caspase-4 (C258A) p22/p10 in complex with GSDMD-C (residues 282–480) ( Table S1 ), which reveals a similar architecture as that of caspase-11 p22/p10-mGSDMD-C complex ( Figure S4 C). Notably, only one GSDMD-C molecule could be modeled. However, protein composition in the complex crystal was comparable to that in the solution state that was determined to contain 2 molecules of caspase-4 p22/p10 and GSDMD-C each ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Indeed, there are electron densities corresponding to the missing GSDMD-C but the quality is too low for model building. This indicates some flexibility in enzyme-substrate binding. Each asymmetric unit contains two of the 2:2 complexes. Structure of caspase-4 p22/p10 dimer resembles that of caspase-11 p22/p10 in the mGSDMD-C complex with their βIII/βIII′ sheet binding to GSDMD-C ( Figures 6 A and S4 C). The binding interface is also analogous to that of the caspase-11 p22/p10-mGSDMD-C complex. Trp267 and Val291 of caspase-4, corresponding to Trp263 and Val287 in caspase-11, and Leu304, Leu308, Val364, and Leu367 of GSDMD-C, equivalent to Leu306, Leu310, Val367, and Leu370 of mGSDMD-C, form the hydrophobic interaction ( Figure S4 F). One of the two auxiliary hydrogen bonds also exists in the caspase-4 p22/p10-GSDMD-C complex, which is mediated by Arg269 of caspase-4 and Glu307 of GSDMD-C ( Figure S4 F). Thus, recognition of GSDMD by caspase-4/11 employs a structural mechanism conserved in humans and mice.
Mutagenesis was then performed to probe functional importance of the hydrophobic substrate-binding interface. A point mutation of Trp267 (W267N or W267L) or Val291 (V291N) in the βIII/βIII′ sheet disrupted in vitro binding of caspase-4 p22/p10 to GSDMD-C ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Caspase-4 p33/p10 W267N and V291N resisted co-immunoprecipitation by GSDMD or GSDMD-C from 293T cells ( Figure 6 C). In LPS-transfected HeLa cells, the two mutants underwent intact autoprocessing but were inactive or impaired in cleaving GSDMD and inducing pyroptosis ( Figure 6 D). Purified caspase-4 p20/p10 W267L and V291N proteins did not cleave GSDMD although they could still cleave the peptide substrate WEHD-AFC ( Figure 6 E and 6F). The peptidase activity of W267N was attenuated due to the close distance of Trp267 to the catalytic cysteine. Similar results were obtained with the corresponding caspase-11 mutants ( Figures S5 B–S5E). On the GSDMD side, double mutations of Val364 and Leu367 (dubbed GSDMD-VL) or triple mutations of Leu304, Leu308 (or Val364), and Leu367 into alanine (dubbed GSDMD-LLL or GSDMD-LVL, respectively) disrupted the binding to caspase-4 p22/p10 ( Figures S5 A and S5B). These mutants resisted or partially resisted co-immunoprecipitation by caspase-4 p33/p10 ( Figure 6 G). In LPS-transfected cells, GSDMD-LLL and GSDMD-LVL were not cleaved and GSDMD-VL was only slightly cleaved, which correlated with the inhibition of pyroptosis ( Figure 6 H). Among the four hydrophobic residues, Val364 and Leu367 are not conserved in other gasdermins. When the Val364 and Leu367-bearing loop in GSDMD (residues 338–367) was replaced with the corresponding loop of GSDMB or GSDMA3, the resulting mutants also resisted caspase-4 cleavage in LPS-transfected cells ( Figure S5 F).
Caspases feature dimerization and proximity-induced activation ( Boatright and Salvesen, 2003; Riedl and Shi, 2004; Ross et al., 2018; Shi, 2004 3. Boatright, K.M. ∙ Salvesen, G.S.

Shi, Y. Caspase activation: revisiting the induced proximity model Cell. 2004; 117 :855-858 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GSDMD-bound caspase-4/11 p20/p10 are dimers in solution according to gel-filtration chromatography and analytic ultracentrifugation analyses. However, caspase-4/11 alone, whether processed or unprocessed, were monomers. Thus, GSDMD binding induces dimerization of the CARD-minus forms of caspase-4/11 likely through stabilizing the βIII/βIII′ sheet. Notably, incubation of caspase-4 p22/10 or p20/p10 with GSDMD-C rendered the caspase capable of cleaving the NFLTD-AFC peptide, and this effect was not seen with GSDMD binding-deficient forms of caspase-4 ( Figure 5 H). GSDMD-binding stimulation of the peptidase activity also occurred on caspase-4 p31/p10 and p33/p10 even when they were already in the LPS-bound oligomeric state ( Figure 5 H). Thus, the hydrophobic interface-mediated substrate binding can enhance the peptidase activity of caspase-4/11.
In the caspase-11 p20/p10-mGSDMD-C long structure ( Figure 6 A), the tetrapeptide-bearing linker is missing and substrate binding is only mediated by the βIII/βIII′ exosite. We overlaid full-length GSDMD structure modeled from the GSDMA3 structure ( Ding et al., 2016 15. Ding, J. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Liu, W. ... Pore-forming activity and structural autoinhibition of the gasdermin family Nature. 2016; 535 :111-116 Crossref Scopus (1825) PubMed Google Scholar ) with that of GSDMD-C in the caspase-4 complex. The overlay revealed that the FLTD motif is adjacent to the C-terminal part of L2 (bearing the autoprocessing site) in caspase-4, proximal to the catalytic pocket ( Figure S4 G). Thus, the enzyme-substrate binding mode, revealed in the caspase-4/11 and GSDMD-C complex structures, is amenable for inserting the tetrapeptide into the catalytic pocket. The insertion is probably driven by the exosite-mediated priming interaction. This explains why caspase-4/11 do not require a specific tetrapeptide sequence to cleave GSDMD. The model also predicts that the length of the linker between the tetrapeptide and the first helix in GSDMD-C shall be an important factor. Confirming the prediction, omitting as few as four residues within the linker blocked GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis in caspase-4-activated HeLa cells ( Figure S4 H).
The complex structures also explain why the caspases must be specifically processed to generate p10 and why the Asp270-processed p12 form of caspase-4 is not active. In the complex, the N terminus of p10, preceding the βIII′, extends toward and is close to another hydrophobic patch near the binding interface on GSDMD-C ( Figures 6 B and S4 F). When caspase-4 is processed at Asp270, the 19-residue extension from the N terminus of p10 inevitably contacts the hydrophobic patch. This will cause steric collision and also electrostatic clashes due to the long and charged side chains ( 286 LEED 289 in caspase-4 and 282 MEAD 285 in caspase-11) of the extension ( Figure 6 B, lower). Thus, the p12 forms of caspase-4 and -11 did not even bind GSDMD ( Figures 3 A, 4 E, 4F, S2 B, S3 E, and S3F), and failed to cleave GSDMD and induce pyroptosis ( Figures 2 G, 2H, 5 A, and 5B).
Early studies have established that caspase-1 is autoprocessed at two inter-domain linkers to form an active p20/p10 complex ( Cerretti et al., 1992; Thornberry et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1994; Wilson et al., 1994 10.

Wilson, K.P. ∙ Black, J.A. ∙ Thomson, J.A. ... Structure and mechanism of interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme Nature. 1994; 370 :270-275 Crossref Scopus (782) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, recent reports suggest that the p20/p10 complex is not necessary for caspase-1 to induce cell death although it is required for cleaving pro-IL-1β ( Broz et al., 2010; Guey et al., 2014 7. Broz, P. ∙ von Moltke, J. ∙ Jones, J.W. ...

USA. 2014; 111 :17254-17259 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another study indicates that the dominant active caspase-1 species in cells is the full-length or the p33/p10 form ( Boucher et al., 2018 4. Boucher, D. ∙ Monteleone, M. ∙ Coll, R.C. ... Caspase-1 self-cleavage is an intrinsic mechanism to terminate inflammasome activity J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :827-840 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Caspase-1 may recognize GSDMD in a different manner from caspase-11 due to its broader peptidyl substrate spectrum ( Ramirez et al., 2018 43. Ramirez, M.L.G. ∙ Poreba, M. ∙ Snipas, S.J. ... Extensive peptide and natural protein substrate screens reveal that mouse caspase-11 has much narrower substrate specificity than caspase-1 J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :7058-7067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the strict requirement of Asp289/Asp285 autoprocessing for caspase-4/11 activation, we further examined the substrate recognition mechanism of caspase-1. We first noted that simultaneous mutations of all seven aspartate and glutamate residues within the linker between the CARD and the p20 in mouse caspase-1 completely blocked the autoprocessing between the CARD and the p20, and the previously used the quadra mutant (E102A/D103A/E121A/D122A) ( Boucher et al., 2018 4. Boucher, D. ∙ Monteleone, M. ∙ Coll, R.C. ... Caspase-1 self-cleavage is an intrinsic mechanism to terminate inflammasome activity J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :827-840 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ) was insufficient ( Figure S6 A). Importantly, both the quadra and septa mutants showed intact p10 production in BsaK-stimulated iBMDMs, and accordingly did not affect GSDMD cleavage and the pyroptosis ( Figures S6 A and S6B). These data validate the p20/p10 form as the active species of caspase-1.
Cleavage of GSDMD by caspase-1 in THP1 cells and mouse macrophages as well as under in vitro condition was also independent of the cleavage-site tetrapeptide sequence in GSDMD ( Figures 7 A, S6 C, and S6D). Caspase-1 p20/p10 was readily co-immunoprecipitated by GSDMD or GSDMD-C in 293T cells ( Figure S6 E). We also assayed caspase-1 cleavage of the six chimeric GSDMD proteins ( Figure S3 A) either in vitro or in inflammasome-activated macrophages. Results from these experiments ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S6 F–S6H) were similar to those obtained with caspase-4/11 and establish that caspase-1 also critically recognizes the GSDMD-C domain. Furthermore, similar to the situation in caspase-4/11, only caspase-1 p20/p10, but not its p32 and p20/p12 forms, was co-immunoprecipitated by GSDMD ( Figure S6 E) and capable of forming a high-affinity binding complex with GSDMD-C ( Figures 7 D and 7E). Thus, site-specific processing of caspase-1 into the p10 form is also required for its targeting of GSDMD.
We further determined a 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of caspase-1 p20/p10 in complex with GSDMD-C (residues 282–480) ( Figure 7 F; Table S1 ). The complex has the same 2:2 stoichiometry and is assembled in a highly similar manner as caspase-11/4-GSDMD-C complexes ( Figure 7 F). The protruding βIII/βIII′ sheet at the caspase-1 dimer interface interacts strongly with the same hydrophobic groove of GSDMD-C, in which Trp294 and Ile318 of caspase-1 function equivalently to Trp267 and Val291 of caspase-4 ( Figure 7 G). Mutation analyses of Trp294 and Ile318 or the cognate four hydrophobic residues in GSDMD confirmed the importance of the hydrophobic interaction for caspase-1 recognition of GSDMD ( Figures 7 E and S7 A–S7C). Caspase-1 I318N and the equivalent mouse caspase-1 I316N mutant, while undergoing normal autoprocessing, were defective in mediating GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis in inflammasome-activated macrophages ( Figures 7 H and S7 D). Reciprocally, the GSDMD-LLL, -LVL, and -VL mutants resisted or partially resisted cleavage by endogenous caspase-1 in PrgI-stimulated THP1 cells, which correlated with the pyroptosis defects ( Figure 7 I). Thus, caspase-1 recognition of GSDMD employs a similar structural mechanism as caspase-4/11, featuring the conserved hydrophobic interface and the independence of tetrapeptide sequence.

Section: Discussion

We have shown that the exosite interaction, mediated by the βIII/βIII′ sheet of autoprocessed caspase-1/4/11, critically recognize GSDMD. The interaction renders a tetrapeptide sequence-independent cleavage. This explains the narrow substrate spectra of caspase-1/4/11 and their high selectivity for GSDMD. Caspase-8 may also cleave GSDMD at the FLTD site ( Orning et al., 2018; Sarhan et al., 2018 41. Orning, P. ∙ Weng, D. ∙ Starheim, K. ...

Rogers, C. ∙ Fernandes-Alnemri, T. ∙ Mayes, L. ... Cleavage of DFNA5 by caspase-3 during apoptosis mediates progression to secondary necrotic/pyroptotic cell death Nat.

Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin Nature. 2017; 547 :99-103 Crossref Scopus (1939) PubMed Google Scholar ). How the two “apoptotic” caspases recognize their gasdermin substrates is an open question. For caspase-3 cleavage of GSDME, the tetrapeptide does play a critical role ( Wang et al., 2017 63. Wang, Y. ∙ Gao, W. ∙ Shi, X. ... Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin Nature. 2017; 547 :99-103 Crossref Scopus (1939) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a diversity in caspase targeting of gasdermins. Caspases are potential drug targets, but targeting the catalytic pocket has been difficult due to the similarity among all caspases ( Poreba et al., 2013 42. Poreba, M. ∙ Strózyk, A. ∙ Salvesen, G.S. ... Caspase substrates and inhibitors Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a008680 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GSDMD-binding pocket in caspase-1/4/11 suggests a way of combating pyroptosis-related diseases like sepsis.
The βIII/βIII′ sheet-mediated substrate recognition is not known for other caspases. However, a L2/L2′ bundle has been noted at the dimer interface of other caspases ( Fuentes-Prior and Salvesen, 2004; Shi, 2004 18. Fuentes-Prior, P. ∙ Salvesen, G.S. The protein structures that shape caspase activity, specificity, activation and inhibition Biochem. J. 2004; 384 :201-232 Crossref Scopus (725) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Shi, Y. Caspase activation: revisiting the induced proximity model Cell. 2004; 117 :855-858 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, other caspases may use a similar exosite to recognize a particular substrate. The possibility is higher for caspase-8/9/10 as they are structurally more analogous to caspase-1/4/11 and cleave a narrow range of substrates. In caspase-1/4/11, formation and functioning of the βIII/βIII′ exosite requires site-specific autoprocessing between the p20 and the p10, which also induces caspase dimerization and activation of the catalytic pocket. However, other studies suggest that autoprocessing of caspase-1 is not required for inducing cell death ( Broz et al., 2010; Guey et al., 2014 7. Broz, P. ∙ von Moltke, J. ∙ Jones, J.W. ... Differential requirement for Caspase-1 autoproteolysis in pathogen-induced cell death and cytokine processing Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8 :471-483 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar 20. Guey, B. ∙ Bodnar, M. ∙ Manié, S.N. ... Caspase-1 autoproteolysis is differentially required for NLRP1b and NLRP3 inflammasome function Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :17254-17259 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). A possible explanation is that the cell death observed in those studies may not be mediated by GSDMD because active inflammasomes can trigger alternative cell death in the absence of caspase-1 or GSDMD ( Lee et al., 2018a; Mascarenhas et al., 2017; Rauch et al., 2017 31. Lee, B.L. ∙ Mirrashidi, K.M. ∙ Stowe, I.B. ... ASC- and caspase-8-dependent apoptotic pathway diverges from the NLRC4 inflammasome in macrophages Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :3788 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Mascarenhas, D.P.A. ∙ Cerqueira, D.M. ∙ Pereira, M.S.F. ... Inhibition of caspase-1 or gasdermin-D enable caspase-8 activation in the Naip5/NLRC4/ASC inflammasome PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006502 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar 46.

We further showed that GSDMD binding allosterically enhances the catalytic activity of caspase-4 that is already in the dimer state. This activation likely results from stabilization of the dimer, and this phenomenon is different from the peptide substrate-induced activation observed in caspase-1 ( Datta et al., 2013 14. Datta, D. ∙ McClendon, C.L. ∙ Jacobson, M.P. ... Substrate and inhibitor-induced dimerization and cooperativity in caspase-1 but not caspase-3 J. Biol.

Seven patients with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis or liver failure and four brain-death donors who provided normal livers for liver transplantation were enrolled in the study from January 2016 to July 2019 in the Organ Transplant Department of the first affiliated hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis or liver failure was based on established criteria, and liver tissue samples were obtained from all the participants accordingly ( Macdonald et al., 2018 36. Macdonald, S. ∙ Andreola, F. ∙ Bachtiger, P. ... Cell death markers in patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation Hepatology. 2018; 67 :989-1002 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Institutional Committee for Human Research of the first affiliated hospital, Sun Yat-sen University approved the study protocol. Written informed consents were obtained from each subject before liver tissue sampling.
Transient transfection was performed using the JetPRIME kit (Polyplus Transfection) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For stable expression, lentiviral plasmids harboring the desired gene were first transfected into 293T cells together with the packing plasmids pSPAX2 and pMD2G at a ratio of 5:3:2. The supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and used to infect indicated cells for another 48 h in the presence of polybrene. Stable expression cells were sorted by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences FACSAria II).
Generation of knockout cells by the CRISPR/Cas9 method ( Ran et al., 2013 44. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Lin, C.Y. ... Double nicking by RNA-guided CRISPR Cas9 for enhanced genome editing specificity Cell. 2013; 154 :1380-1389 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2632) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed as described in our recent publication ( Shi et al., 2015 57. Shi, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, K. ... Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases determines pyroptotic cell death Nature. 2015; 526 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (4209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequences of the gRNAs are: 5′-GGTGTTTTGGATAACTTGG-3′ & 5′-GTGAGGAAATCTTTGCCCA-3′ for CASP4 , and 5′-TTCCACTTCTACGATGCCA-3′ for GSDMD in HeLa cells; 5′-CATTCTTCAGTGTGGACCC-3′ for Casp11 , 5′-AGCATCCTGGCATTCCGAG-3′ for Gsdmd , 5′-ATTATGCATATGCCCATTTC-3′ for Casp3 , and 5′-ACTTGCAAACATTACTGCTA-3′ & 5′-GGAATTCTGGAGCTTCAATC-3′ for Casp1 in iBMDM cells; 5′- CAAGAGAAGCAACGTATGGC-3′ & 5′-TCCCTAAGGTTGTGGAATTC-3′ for CASP4 in A431 cells; 5′-CTTGCTTTAGACGTGCAGCG-3′ & 5′-CGATGTGTGGACGTTCGTGC-3′ for GSDMD , and 5′-AAGCTGTTTATCCGTTCCAT-3′ & 5′-GCTCCCTAGAAGAAGCTCAA-3′ for CASP1 in THP1 cells.
For co-immunoprecipitation, 1.5 × 10 6 HEK293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid at a confluency of 70%. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min on ice. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatants were subjected to anti-Flag M2 immunoprecipitation following the manufacturer’s instruction. After 2-h incubation at 4°C, the beads were washed for five times with the lysis buffer, and then boiled with the SDS loading buffer for 10 min. The immunoprecipitates were applied to standard immunoblotting analyses. All immunoprecipitation assays were performed for at least three times and the representative results are shown in the figures.
To stimulate caspase-4/11 activation, LPS was electroporated into indicated cells using the Neon Transfection System (Life Technologies). Activation of the canonical caspase-1 inflammasome was performed as previously described ( Yang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2011 66. Yang, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Shi, J. ... Human NAIP and mouse NAIP1 recognize bacterial type III secretion needle protein for inflammasome activation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :14408-14413 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Zhao, Y. ∙ Yang, J. ∙ Shi, J. ... The NLRC4 inflammasome receptors for bacterial flagellin and type III secretion apparatus Nature. 2011; 477 :596-600 Crossref Scopus (977) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, THP1 cells were differentiated to macrophages by 36-h incubation with 50 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). LFn-tagged PrgI or BsaK together with PA proteins were added to THP1 or iBMDM cells, respectively, at the final concentration of 1 μg/mL. For caspase-4 activation induced by bacterial infection, WT S. Typhimurium was cultured overnight at 37°C in LB broth with vigorous shaking. Bacterial cultures were then diluted by 1:100 with fresh LB broth and grown until OD 600 reached 1.0. The bacteria were diluted in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and used to infect A431 cells at MOI of 50. After 45-min incubation at 37°C, the infected cells were washed with PBS for three times to remove extracellular bacteria and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 100 μg/mL gentamycin until indicated time points. Culture supernatants of treated cells collected 2 h post-infection were subjected to TCA precipitation. Both the supernatants and cell lysate samples were applied to standard immunoblotting analyses.
For immunofluorescence, differentiated THP1 cells were treated with LFn-tagged PrgI and PA for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS for three times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature (RT). The fixed cells were washed with PBS again and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The permeabilized cells were then blocked with FBS for 30 min followed by staining with the indicated primary and secondary antibody for 1 h at RT. Fluorescence images were acquired on the Nikon A1 Confocal Laser Microscope System.
For immunohistochemistry, 5-μm formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded liver sections were deparaffinized in xylenes and rehydrated through a series of graded alcohol. The sections were initially treated by the hydrated autoclave method in an antigen retrieval buffer (0.1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). The slides were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to block the activity of endogenous peroxidase. Afterward, the sections were blocked with the blocking reagent in goat serum for 1 h at RT and then incubated with primary antibodies over night at 4°C. Immunostaining was achieved by a two-step IHC detection reagent (PV-6001, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) and DAB kit (ZLI-9017, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China). The sections were counterstained with Myer’s Hematoxylin.
For immunocytochemistry, stimulated cells were pelleted at 500 g for 20 min and washed with PBS for three times. The cell pellets were re-suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and washed with PBS again. The pellets were carefully re-suspended in 70% (v/v) alcohol and then dehydrated through a series of graded alcohol: 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100% (v/v) (40 min each). The dehydrated pellets were cleared in xylene and embedded in the paraffin for 3 h. 5-μm sections were prepared and applied to standard IHC protocols as described above.
Cell viability and cytotoxicity assays were performed as previous described ( Shi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017 57. Shi, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, K. ... Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases determines pyroptotic cell death Nature. 2015; 526 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (4209) PubMed Google Scholar 63. Wang, Y. ∙ Gao, W. ∙ Shi, X. ... Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin Nature. 2017; 547 :99-103 Crossref Scopus (1939) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, cell viability was determined by measuring ATP levels (G7570, Promega). Cell cytotoxicity was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the culture supernatants (G1780, Promega). Results were represented as the mean ± SD from three technical repeats.
For recombinant expression of caspase-4 in E. coli , cDNAs encoding the enzymatically inactive C/A mutant version of full-length (FL) caspase-4 or its p32 protease domain alone were cloned into a modified pET vector with an N-terminal 6 × His-SUMO tag (pSUMO). For recombinant expression of different forms of non-covalent complex of caspase-4 C/A, cDNAs of the large subunit (p33, p22, or p20 fragment), and those of the small subunit (p12 and p10) were cloned into the pSUMO and pET21a vector, respectively. A plasmid combination of a large and a small subunit were co-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The bacteria were cultured in LB medium with appropriate antibiotics. Protein expression was induced overnight at 20°C with 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) after OD 600 reached 0.8. Cells were lysed in buffer A containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole. Fusion proteins with 6 × His-SUMO tag were affinity-purified by Ni-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). To purify LPS-free caspase-4 FL or p33/p10 complex (C/A version), the fusion proteins captured on the Ni-Sepharose beads were subjected to additional wash with 0.5% Triton X-100- supplemented buffer A to remove the LPS contamination. The 6 × His-SUMO tag was removed by overnight digestion with homemade ULP1 protease at 4°C. The untagged proteins were further purified by HiTrap Q ion-exchange and Superdex G75 gel-filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). To obtain LPS-free caspase-4 p31/p12 complex, a TEV-protease cleavage site was inserted between D270 and S271 of full-length caspase-4 (C/A) and the protein was expressed and purified as described above. The purified protein was digested overnight with homemade His-tagged TEV protease to obtain the p31/p12 complex. The TEV protease was then depleted by Ni-Sepharose beads, and untagged p31/p12 complex was finally purified by another round of Superdex G75 gel-filtration chromatography. Recombinant caspase-11, caspase-1, and GSDMD proteins were expressed and purified similarly above described for caspase-4. HiTrap SP cation exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was used for purifying the caspase-1 protein.
Recombinant expression of full-length catalytically active caspase-4 and −11 using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Life technologies) has been described in our previous publication ( Shi et al., 2014 56. Shi, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Inflammatory caspases are innate immune receptors for intracellular LPS Nature. 2014; 514 :187-192 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Purification of the caspases followed the same procedure as above described for the catalytically inactive C/A mutant except that 1 mM Zn 2+ was supplemented into buffer A to prevent background autoproteolysis.
To express the p20/p10 complex of catalytically active caspase-4, cDNAs encoding the p20 and p10 fragments were cloned into a single pACYCDuet vector with the p20 subunit fused with an N-terminal 6 × His tag. The p20/p10 complex was purified by Ni-Sepharose beads in buffer B containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and eluted with buffer B containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluted proteins were further purified by HiTrap Q anion exchange and Superdex G75 gel-filtration chromatography. For obtain the p22/p10 complex, p20/p12 complex, and the p32 fragment of catalytically active caspase-4, cDNAs encoding the p32 fragment with D270A, D289A, and D270/289A mutation, respectively, were cloned into the pACYCDuet vector. The expressed p32 protease domain underwent autoproteolysis to generate the desired non-covalent complex or remained intact, and were purified in the same way as that described for the p20/p10 complex. For recombinant expression of the p22/p10 complex and the intact p32 fragment of catalytically active caspase-11, cDNAs of the p32 fragment with or without D285A mutation were also cloned into the pACYCDuet vector. In the absence of D285 mutation, the expressed p32 fragment underwent autoproteolysis to generate the desired non-covalent p22/p10 complex. In the case of D285A mutation, the expressed caspase-11 protein showed artificial autoproteolysis at D277. To circumvent the non-specific autoproteolysis, D277A/D285A double mutation was introduced to obtain high-quality stable p32 fragment of caspase-11. Purification of these caspase-11 proteins were the same as that of caspase-4.
Expression and purification of the p20/p10 complex of catalytically active caspase-1 were performed by using the previously reported refolding method ( Roschitzki-Voser et al., 2012 49. Roschitzki-Voser, H. ∙ Schroeder, T. ∙ Lenherr, E.D. ... Human caspases in vitro: expression, purification and kinetic characterization Protein Expr. Purif. 2012; 84 :236-246 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, non-tagged p20 and p10 subunits were both cloned into the pET-21a vector and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 37°C. Bacterial pellets containing the inclusion body were collected, washed twice with buffer C containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, and 1 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnCl), and then solubilized in buffer D containing 6.5 M GdnCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, and 100 mM DTT. Equal molar amounts of each subunit were mixed to a total volume of 5 mL and quickly diluted into 250 mL of refolding buffer containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium malonate, 20% sucrose, 0.5 M NDSB-201, and 10 mM DTT. The refolded proteins were concentrated and dialyzed overnight over buffer E containing 30 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.9), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and then exchanged into buffer F containing 72 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.9), 400 mM sodium malonate, and 10% (v/v) glycerol.
All purified proteins were stored in buffer G containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT.
Purified caspase proteins were incubated with indicated GSDMD proteins at a molar ratio of 1:1 on ice for 2 h. The mixtures were then loaded onto a Superdex G200 10/300 column and eluted with the buffer G. Caspase or GSDMD-C protein alone was analyzed on the same column as controls. The eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. To obtain caspase-4-GSDMD-C complex, purified p22/p10 complex of caspase-4 (C/A) was incubated with human GSDMD-C at a molar ratio of 1:1.2 on ice for 2 h. The complex was purified by Superdex G75 gel-filtration chromatography and concentrated to 40 mg/mL for crystallization. As for caspase-11/1-GSDMD-C complex, purified p22/p10 complex of caspase-11 (C/A) or p20/p10 of caspase-1 (C/A) was mixed with mouse GSDMD-C long or human GSDMD-C, respectively, at a molar ratio of 1:1 on ice for at least 2 h before crystallization.
The crystallization experiments were carried out at 20°C using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method with 2 μL drops containing 1 μL of protein solution and 1 μL of reservoir solution equilibrated over 100 μL of reservoir solution. Qualified crystals of caspase-11 p22/p10 were obtained in the reservoir buffer containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, and 4% formaldehyde. Crystals of caspase-11 p20/p12 were obtained in the reservoir buffer containing 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.7) and 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. Caspase-11 p32 crystals were grown in the reservoir buffer containing100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, and 180 mM lithium acetate. Crystals of caspase-4 p22/p10-GSDMD-C complex were obtained in the reservoir buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM sodium tartrate, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 4% (v/v) 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. Crystals of caspase-11 p22/p10-mGSDMD-C long complex were grown in the reservoir buffer containing 200 mM sodium malonate (pH 6.5), 18% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 10 mM TCEP. Crystals of caspase-1 p20/p10-GSDMD-C complex were obtained in the reservoir buffer containing 150 mM potassium bromide and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol mono-methyester 2000. All the caspase-GSDMD-C complex crystals were crosslinked in 25% glutaraldehyde for 20-60 min ( Heras and Martin, 2005 22. Heras, B. ∙ Martin, J.L. Post-crystallization treatments for improving diffraction quality of protein crystals Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61 :1173-1180 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ) before soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing the reservoir buffer supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol or 20% (v/v) DMSO. The crystals were subjected to flash-freezing with liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Shanghai, China) beamline BL19U1 and BL17U, and processed with XDS package ( Kabsch, 2010 24. Kabsch, W. Xds Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12932) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phase of these structures was determined by molecular replacement method and automatic model building was performed in the PHENIX suite ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rest of the model was manually built with Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 17. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). All the structures were refined with PHENIX, and manual modeling was performed between refinement cycles. Statistics of data collection and refinement were summarized in Table S1 . Quality of the final models was validated by MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 11. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11087) PubMed Google Scholar ). All the structural figures were prepared in PyMOL.
Hydrolysis of fluorogenic peptidyl substrates by recombinant WT caspases were performed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% (v/v) CHAPS, and 10 mM DTT. Unless otherwise mentioned, the final concentration of fluorogenic peptidyl substrates and caspase proteins were 100 μM and 0.5 μM, respectively. Substrate cleavage was monitored by measuring the emission signal at 505-nm wavelength by a 400-nm fluorescence excitation on a fluorescent multi-well reader (TECAN).
To examine cleavage of GSDMD, 20 μM substrate proteins were incubated with 0.1 or 0.5 μM caspases at 37°C for indicated time. SDS loading buffer was then added to the reaction mixture followed by boiling at 95°C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining.
The caspase-4 p22/p10-GSDMD-C complex were exchanged to a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl. Sedimentation velocity analysis was carried out with an XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with an An-50 Ti rotor at 10°C. Data were collected at the speed of 40,000 rpm for 8 h. Absorbance scans were taken at 280 nm at 6-min intervals in a radial direction. Data were analyzed by using the software SEDFIT ( Brown and Schuck, 2006 5. Brown, P.H. ∙ Schuck, P. Macromolecular size-and-shape distributions by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation Biophys. J. 2006; 90 :4651-4661 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (464) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Caspase and GSDMD-C binding kinetics were measured at 25°C on a Biacore 8K SPR instrument (GE Healthcare). A running buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20 was prepared, filtered and degassed before use. Flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip were activated for 7 min with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.1 M N-ethyl-N’-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The p22/p10 complex of caspase-4 (C/A) and p20/p10 complex of caspase-1 (C/A) were diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5 for caspase-4 and pH 5.5 for caspase-1) to a concentration of 20 μg/mL, and immobilized on the CM5 chip to a response signal of 7,084 (for caspase-4) or 10,578 (for caspase-1). The remaining binding sites on the chip were blocked by 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5) at a flow rate of 10 μL/min for 2 min. Indicated GSDMD-C proteins at a series of concentrations were injected into the flow cell to pass over the immobilized target. The binding signal was measured by a multiple-cycle method with 60 s association and 120 s dissociation at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. To measure the binding affinity between caspase-11 and mGSDMD-C, the p22/p10 complex of caspase-11 (C/A) was immobilized on the CM5 chip to a response signal of 10,002 and the binding signal was measured by a single-cycle method. The titrating protein concentrations are 0.25 μM, 0.74 μM, 2.22 μM, 6.67 μM, and 20 μM for WT GSDMD-C, and 1.2 μM, 3.7 μM, 11.1 μM, 33.3 μM and 100 μM for GSDMD-C mutants. Each SPR measurement was repeated for three times to obtain the Kd (mean values ± s.d.).
ATP-based cell viability assays ( Figures 2 C, 2D, 3 C, 3D, 6 D, 6H, S4 H, and S5 E), LDH release-based cell death assays ( Figures 2 H, 7 A, 7H, 7I, S6 B, S6C, and S7 D), SPR measurements of binding constants ( Figures 4 F, 7 E, and S5 B), and fluorescent-peptide cleavage assays of caspase activation ( Figure 5 H) are reported as means ± SD from three independent replicates. No statistical analyses were performed but all assays were repeated for a minimum of 3 times with similar results obtained.
The atomic coordinates and structure factors generated in this study have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession codes 6KMT, 6KMU, and 6KN1 for caspase-11 C/A p32, p22/p10, and p20/p12, respectively, and 6KMZ, 6KMV, and 6KN0 for caspase-4-p22/p10-GSDMD-C complex, caspase-11-p22/p10-GSDMD-C complex, and caspase-1-p20/p10-GSDMD-C complex, respectively.
