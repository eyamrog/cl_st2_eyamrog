Title: Cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist genistein attenuates marijuana-induced vascular inflammation


Abstract: Summary

Epidemiological studies reveal that marijuana increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, little is known about the mechanism. Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC), the psychoactive component of marijuana, binds to cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1/CNR1) in the vasculature and is implicated in CVD. A UK Biobank analysis found that cannabis was an risk factor for CVD. We found that marijuana smoking activated inflammatory cytokines implicated in CVD. In silico virtual screening identified genistein, a soybean isoflavone, as a putative CB1 antagonist. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells were used to model Δ 9 -THC-induced inflammation and oxidative stress via NF-κB signaling. Knockdown of the CB1 receptor with siRNA, CRISPR interference, and genistein attenuated the effects of Δ 9 -THC. In mice, genistein blocked Δ 9 -THC-induced endothelial dysfunction in wire myograph, reduced atherosclerotic plaque, and had minimal penetration of the central nervous system. Genistein is a CB1 antagonist that attenuates Δ 9 -THC-induced atherosclerosis.

Section: Introduction

Marijuana is one of the most widely used illicit drugs worldwide ( Thomas et al., 2014 78. Thomas, G. ∙ Kloner, R.A. ∙ Rezkalla, S. Adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular effects of marijuana inhalation: what cardiologists need to know Am. J. Cardiol. 2014; 113 :187-190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). The growing legalization of marijuana is expected to increase the use of marijuana, highlighting the need to learn about its adverse effects, particularly those affecting the cardiovascular systems. Retrospective studies indicate that marijuana increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including myocardial infarction (MI), angina, and arrhythmias ( DeFilippis et al., 2018 21. Defilippis, E.M. ∙ Singh, A. ∙ Divakaran, S. ... Cocaine and marijuana use among young adults with myocardial infarction J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2018; 71 :2540-2551 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thomas et al., 2014 78. Thomas, G. ∙ Kloner, R.A. ∙ Rezkalla, S. Adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular effects of marijuana inhalation: what cardiologists need to know Am. J. Cardiol. 2014; 113 :187-190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Marijuana exposure is known to induce endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and metabolic dysfunction in animal models ( Wang et al., 2016 79. Wang, X. ∙ Derakhshandeh, R. ∙ Liu, J. ... One minute of marijuana second hand smoke exposure substantially impairs vascular endothelial function J. Am. Heart Assoc. 2016; 5 Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar ; Pacher et al., 2018 61. Pacher, P. ∙ Steffens, S. ∙ Haskó, G. ... Cardiovascular effects of marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids: the good, the bad, and the ugly Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2018; 15 :151-166 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two synthetic cannabinoids for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and HIV-associated anorexia: dronabinol and nabilone ( Whiting et al., 2015 81. Whiting, P.F. ∙ Wolff, R.F. ∙ Deshpande, S. ... Cannabinoids for medical use: a systematic review and meta-analysis JAMA. 2015; 313 :2456-2473 Crossref Scopus (1655) PubMed Google Scholar ). Synthetic cannabinoids are also associated with adverse cardiovascular effects ( Pacher et al., 2018 61. Pacher, P. ∙ Steffens, S. ∙ Haskó, G. ... Cardiovascular effects of marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids: the good, the bad, and the ugly Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2018; 15 :151-166 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, there is a need to understand the link between marijuana and CVD.
Two cannabinoid receptors mediate the effects of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC), cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1/CNR1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2/CNR2), which belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily ( Atakan, 2012 3. Atakan, Z. Cannabis, a complex plant: different compounds and different effects on individuals Ther. Adv. Psychopharmacol. 2012; 2 :241-254 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hoffman and Lupica, 2013 35. Hoffman, A.F. ∙ Lupica, C.R. Synaptic targets of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the central nervous system Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2013; 3 :a012237 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). The most abundant GPCR in the mammalian brain, CB1, regulates the psychoactive effects of marijuana. The CB1 receptor is also expressed in other peripheral tissues such as the heart, vasculature, and smooth muscle. The CB2 receptor is not only expressed in immune cells, particularly in macrophages, but also in endothelial cells ( Pacher and Mechoulam, 2011 60. Pacher, P. ∙ Mechoulam, R. Is lipid signaling through cannabinoid 2 receptors part of a protective system? Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50 :193-211 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cannabinoid receptors have endogenous ligands known as endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoid signaling is important for metabolic regulation, memory, mood, pain, and immune function ( Mackie, 2006 48. Mackie, K. Cannabinoid receptors as therapeutic targets Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46 :101-122 Crossref Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar ). The endocannabinoid anandamide is made on-demand, unlike classical neurotransmitters ( Di Marzo et al., 1994 23. DiMarzo, V. ∙ Fontana, A. ∙ Cadas, H. ... Formation and inactivation of endogenous cannabinoid anandamide in central neurons Nature. 1994; 372 :686-691 Crossref Scopus (1395) PubMed Google Scholar ), and causes vasodilation, bradycardia, and hypotension ( Movahed et al., 2005 55. Movahed, P. ∙ Evilevitch, V. ∙ Andersson, T.L. ... Vascular effects of anandamide and N-acylvanillylamines in the human forearm and skin microcirculation Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146 :171-179 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous studies found that CB1 activation is proatherogenic by promoting inflammation and oxidative stress that cause endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, whereas CB2 activation is anti-atherogenic ( Pacher et al., 2018 61. Pacher, P. ∙ Steffens, S. ∙ Haskó, G. ... Cardiovascular effects of marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids: the good, the bad, and the ugly Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2018; 15 :151-166 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ibsen et al., 2017 37. Ibsen, M.S. ∙ Connor, M. ∙ Glass, M. Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor signaling and bias Cannabis Cannabinoid Res. 2017; 2 :48-60 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). CB2 agonists are in development for vascular disorder ( Pacher and Mechoulam, 2011 60. Pacher, P. ∙ Mechoulam, R. Is lipid signaling through cannabinoid 2 receptors part of a protective system? Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50 :193-211 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ), and CB1 antagonists are anti-atherogenic ( Pacher et al., 2018 61. Pacher, P. ∙ Steffens, S. ∙ Haskó, G. ... Cardiovascular effects of marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids: the good, the bad, and the ugly Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2018; 15 :151-166 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ).
CB1 signaling is also involved in various pathophysiological processes, including obesity, smoking cessation, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and cancer ( Sugamura et al., 2009 75. Sugamura, K. ∙ Sugiyama, S. ∙ Nozaki, T. ... Activated endocannabinoid system in coronary artery disease and antiinflammatory effects of cannabinoid 1 receptor blockade on macrophages Circulation. 2009; 119 :28-36 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). In 2006, rimonabant became the first CB1 antagonist approved for treating obesity ( Després et al., 2005 22. Després, J.P. ∙ Golay, A. ∙ Sjöström, L., Rimonabant in Obesity-Lipids Study Group Effects of rimonabant on metabolic risk factors in overweight patients with dyslipidemia N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353 :2121-2134 Crossref Scopus (1346) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, rimonabant was withdrawn in 2008 due to psychiatric side effects ( Onakpoya et al., 2016 59. Onakpoya, I.J. ∙ Heneghan, C.J. ∙ Aronson, J.K. Worldwide withdrawal of medicinal products because of adverse drug reactions: a systematic review and analysis Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2016; 46 :477-489 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moreira et al., 2009 53. Moreira, F.A. ∙ Grieb, M. ∙ Lutz, B. Central side-effects of therapies based on CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists: focus on anxiety and depression Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 23 :133-144 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an effort to reduce the psychiatric side effects, pharmaceutical companies developed peripherally restricted CB1 antagonists, which may soon enter clinical development ( Cinar et al., 2020 18. Cinar, R. ∙ Iyer, M.R. ∙ Kunos, G. The therapeutic potential of second and third generation CB1R antagonists Pharmacol. Ther. 2020; 208 :107477 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). The development of CB1 antagonists that lack psychiatric side effects would be clinically significant for treating obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and CVD.
The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) based on somatic cell reprogramming has transformed the field of stem cell biology ( Shi et al., 2017 74. Shi, Y. ∙ Inoue, H. ∙ Wu, J.C. ... Induced pluripotent stem cell technology: a decade of progress Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017; 16 :115-130 Crossref Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human iPSCs (hiPSCs) avoid the ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Patient-specific hiPSC-derived cell lineages (i.e., neurons, cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and smooth muscle cells) hold great promise in regenerative medicine and drug discovery for their ability to generate a limitless supply of differentiated cell lineages for disease modeling. hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) contain any given individual’s genetic information and permit the investigation of patient-specific causes of vascular disease ( Lau et al., 2019 42. Lau, E. ∙ Paik, D.T. ∙ Wu, J.C. Systems-wide approaches in induced pluripotent stem cell models Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2019; 14 :395-419 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), making them an ideal platform for vascular disease modeling and drug discovery.
In this study, we found that cannabis users from the UK Biobank database analysis showed a higher risk of MI than non-cannabis users. We recruited volunteer subjects and found marijuana smoking elevated plasma markers of inflammation associated with atherosclerosis. Using in silico modeling, we discovered that genistein, an isoflavone abundantly present in soybeans, could bind to the CB1 receptor and inhibit its activity. Complementary in vitro and in vivo studies uncovered that genistein is a neutral antagonist of the CB1 receptor that blocks the pathophysiological effects of the CB1 receptor in the vasculature with minimal central nervous system (CNS) penetration. Thus, our study reveals that genistein attenuates Δ 9 -THC-induced endothelial dysfunction via CB1 inhibition and can serve as a CB1 antagonist.

Section: Results

The UK Biobank is the largest prospective cohort study to date, containing genetic and phenotypic data on 500,000 individuals aged 40–69 ( Bycroft et al., 2018 12. Bycroft, C. ∙ Freeman, C. ∙ Petkova, D. ... The UK biobank resource with deep phenotyping and genomic data Nature. 2018; 562 :203-209 Crossref Scopus (3989) PubMed Google Scholar ). Participants were recruited between 2006 and 2010 and serially followed over time. The UK Biobank provides a unique opportunity to characterize relationships across a wide assortment of phenotypes. Here, we utilized the UK Biobank to determine the relationship between cannabis use, MI, and other cardiovascular events ( Figure 1 A). Prior studies demonstrating an association between cannabis use and MI were conducted in individuals who developed MI before the age of 50 ( DeFilippis et al., 2018 21. Defilippis, E.M. ∙ Singh, A. ∙ Divakaran, S. ... Cocaine and marijuana use among young adults with myocardial infarction J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2018; 71 :2540-2551 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). When controlling for age, body mass index (BMI), and sex, we demonstrated that cannabis use was a statistically significant positive predictor for MI, using a logistic regression model.
Inflammation is central in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, so we next investigated for markers of inflammation using an Olink proteomic analysis of plasma from recreational smokers ( Figure 1 B). After smoking a marijuana cigarette, plasma samples were serially drawn over 180 min. The Olink inflammation panel analysis revealed that several inflammatory cytokines were upregulated at 90 min, including TGFB, CCL4, CCL19, CXCL6, CXCL10, CXCL11, IL-8, MCP2, MCP4, TNF, and CCL11. These upregulated cytokines are all implicated in atherosclerosis ( Chen et al., 2019 16. Chen, P.Y. ∙ Qin, L. ∙ Li, G. ...

Chemokines in the vascular inflammatory response of atherosclerosis Cardiovasc. Res. 2010; 86 :192-201 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). FTL3 was downregulated after marijuana smoking, which is also associated with accelerated atherosclerosis in Flt3 (−/−) Ldlr (−/−) mice ( Choi et al., 2011 17.

The SWEETLEAD chemical database ( Moshiri et al., 2020 54. Moshiri, J. ∙ Constant, D.A. ∙ Liu, B. ... A targeted computational screen of the SWEETLEAD database reveals FDA-approved compounds with anti-dengue viral activity mBio. 2020; 11 e02839–20 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) was screened against 4 selective CB1 antagonists using the ROCS software suite ( Figure 2 A). Ligand-based high-throughput virtual screening with a chemical database was used to discover new selective CB1 antagonists ( Figure 2 B). We found 62 chemical compounds that were structurally homologous with the 4 selective CB1 antagonists. To refine our search, a molecular docking analysis was performed to probe the interactions between the chemical compounds and the CB1 receptor with the selective CB1 antagonist AM6538 as a positive control. The Schrödinger (Portland, OR, United States of America) suite with glide protein-ligand docking functionality was used to validate that genistein was a ligand for the CB1 receptor ( Table S1 ). We discovered that genistein, a natural soybean flavonoid, binds to the CB1 receptor ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Genistein adopted a similar shape to the selective CB1 antagonist query structures ( Figure 2 E). An in vitro GTPase assay found that genistein functions as a neutral antagonist ( Figure 2 F). Radioligand binding assays for predicted targets of genistein binding ( Tables S2 and S3 ) revealed that genistein binds human CB1 with an IC 50 of 150 nM ( Table S4 ).
We next evaluated Δ 9 -THC cytotoxicity in three different cell types: (1) human endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs] and human coronary artery endothelial cells [HCAECs]), (2) human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (H7 hESC-CMs), and (3) normal human cardiac fibroblasts-ventricular (NHCF-V) cells. We observed that Δ 9 -THC induced cytotoxicity in human endothelial cells without any adverse effect on cardiomyocytes or cardiac fibroblasts ( Figure 3 A). Inflammation and oxidative stress cause endothelial dysfunction ( Heitzer et al., 2001 32. Heitzer, T. ∙ Schlinzig, T. ∙ Krohn, K. ... Endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease Circulation. 2001; 104 :2673-2678 Crossref Scopus (1723) PubMed Google Scholar ), so we investigated the expression of these genes in HUVECs exposed to Δ 9 -THC to uncover the mechanism of such endothelial cytotoxicity. We observed that Δ 9 -THC induced the expression of inflammation-related genes and reduced the antioxidant-related gene expression ( Figures 3 B and 3C). HUVECs were derived from large pools of female patients with environmental exposures that might affect the phenotype with Δ 9 -THC. However, hiPSC-ECs are free of previous environmental exposures. Therefore, hiPSC-EC lines were generated from 4 healthy individuals through a chemically defined differentiation protocol ( Figure S1 A). hiPSC-ECs formed capillary-like tubes mimicking angiogenesis in vitro ( Figure S1 B), and Δ 9 -THC also induced cytotoxicity ( Figure S1 C; key resource table ).
Cannabinoids exert their effects through the CB1 and CB2 receptors. We, therefore, evaluated the expression of cannabinoid receptors in hiPSC-ECs using hiPSC-derived neurons and human erythroblast cells (HEL92.1.7) as positive controls. The CB1 receptor was expressed in hiPSC-ECs, but CB2 receptor expression was not detected in our assays ( Figure S1 D). Thus, hiPSC-ECs can model the effects of Δ 9 -THC on the vasculature via the CB1 receptor. hiPSC-ECs can also reflect the paucity of CB2 receptor expression found in adult vascular endothelial cells.
Because antioxidant-related genes were reduced by Δ 9 -THC treatment in HUVECs, we evaluated those genes in hiPSC-ECs and found that Δ 9 -THC also decreased mRNA expression of antioxidant-related genes, including superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ), superoxide dismutase 2 ( SOD2 ), catalase ( CAT ), and glutathione peroxidase 1 ( GPX1 ) ( Figure 3 C). In addition, ROS-related genes implicated in endothelial dysfunction ( Förstermann and Sessa, 2012 25. Förstermann, U. ∙ Sessa, W.C. Nitric oxide synthases: regulation and function Eur. Heart J. 2012; 33 :829-837 Crossref Scopus (3045) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as NADPH oxidase 1 ( NOX1 ) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( NOS2 ), were upregulated in hiPSC-ECs after Δ 9 -THC treatment ( Figure 3 D). Immunofluorescence staining showed that Δ 9 -THC treatment of hiPSC-ECs also induced cellular oxidative stress with increased hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) levels ( Figures 3 E and S2 A).
Media reports have touted the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabis and Δ 9 -THC despite a paucity of data ( Nagarkatti et al., 2009 57. Nagarkatti, P. ∙ Pandey, R. ∙ Rieder, S.A. ... Cannabinoids as novel anti-inflammatory drugs Future Med.Chem. 2009; 1 :1333-1349 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ; Klein and Newton, 2007 39. Klein, T.W. ∙ Newton, C.A. Therapeutic potential of cannabinoid-based drugs Adv.Exp.Med.Biol. 2007; 601 :395-413 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). We, therefore, sought to add to the literature by investigating the expression of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-ECs after treatment with Δ 9 -THC. We observed that proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were increased in response to Δ 9 -THC ( Figure 4 A), while I kappa B ( NFKBIA ), a specific inhibitor of the NF-κB transcription factor, was inhibited by Δ 9 -THC ( Figure 3 A). TNF-α contributes to vascular dysfunction ( Boesten et al., 2005 10. Boesten, L.S. ∙ Zadelaar, A.S. ∙ Van Nieuwkoop, A. ... Tumor necrosis factor-alpha promotes atherosclerotic lesion progression in APOE ∗ 3-Leiden transgenic mice Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 66 :179-185 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). After Δ 9 -THC treatment, TNF-α concentration was increased in the cell culture medium of hiPSC-ECs ( Figure 4 B). Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is associated with the development of atherosclerosis ( Mestas and Ley, 2008 52. Mestas, J. ∙ Ley, K. Monocyte-endothelial cell interactions in the development of atherosclerosis Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2008; 18 :228-232 Crossref Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined the adhesion of monocytes to hiPSC-ECs after Δ 9 -THC treatment and found that monocytes had increased adhesion to hiPSC-ECs ( Figures 4 C and 4D).
The longitudinal effects of Δ 9 -THC-induced inflammation were assessed in hiPSC-ECs using wash-out experiments. After treatment with Δ 9 -THC for 48 h, the supernatant in hiPSC-ECs was replaced with fresh medium. The expression of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-ECs was evaluated every other day for 2 weeks. The Δ 9 -THC-induced expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were sustained for 8 to 10 days after the initial exposure ( Figure 4 E). Thus, Δ 9 -THC-induced inflammation persisted four to five times longer than the initial exposure.
We next sought to elucidate the mechanisms of how Δ 9 -THC causes oxidative stress in the vasculature via CB1. The elevated levels of TNF-α suggested that NF-κB could cause activation of inflammatory genes and promote oxidative stress via the nuclear translocation of the p65 component of the complex ( Mattioli et al., 2004 50. Mattioli, I. ∙ Sebald, A. ∙ Bucher, C. ... Transient and selective NF-kappa B p65 serine 536 phosphorylation induced by T cell costimulation is mediated by I kappa B kinase beta and controls the kinetics of p65 nuclear import J. Immunol. 2004; 172 :6336-6344 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Δ 9 -THC-binding activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, which is known to regulate NF-kB by increasing transcription of NF-kB and facilitating NF-kB translocation to the nucleus ( Saha et al., 2007 72. Saha, R.N. ∙ Jana, M. ∙ Pahan, K. MAPK p38 regulates transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB in primary human astrocytes via acetylation of p65 J. Immunol. 2007; 179 :7101-7109 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). In hiPSC-ECs, Δ 9 -THC also causes increased phosphorylation of p38 ( Figure S2 H). The cellular distribution of NF-κB was subsequently investigated in hiPSC-ECs after Δ 9 -THC treatment. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that Δ 9 -THC induced NF-κβ’s nuclear translocation of NF-κB ( Figure 4 F) and phosphorylation of NF-κB in hiPSC-ECs. The Δ 9 -THC-mediated phosphorylation of NF-κB was abrogated by the selective NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 ( Figures 4 G and S2 I).
The CB1 receptor is implicated in the pathological effects of Δ 9 -THC on the vasculature. We next employed pharmacologic and genetic inactivation of the CB1 receptor to determine whether the CB1 receptor plays a role in Δ 9 -THC-induced effects in hiPSC-ECs. The selective CB1 antagonists AM6545, AM251, and NESS-0327 reversed Δ 9 -THC-induced mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes and oxidative stress protective-related genes ( Figure S3 A). The Δ 9 -THC-induced effects were also reversed by the knockdown of CB1 by siRNA ( Figure S3 B). Similarly, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) of CB1 expression reversed Δ 9 -THC-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in hiPSC-ECs ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Genistein is known to ameliorate TNF-α-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress in endothelial cells ( Jia et al., 2013 38. Jia, Z. ∙ Babu, P.V. ∙ Si, H. ... Genistein inhibits TNF-alpha-induced endothelial inflammation through the protein kinase pathway A and improves vascular inflammation in C57BL/6 mice Int. J. Cardiol. 2013; 168 :2637-2645 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). We, therefore, tested if the CB1 receptor was required for genistein to block the effects of TNF-α in hiPSC-ECs using CRISPRi to assess CB1 expression. We discovered that the CB1 receptor was required for genistein to attenuate the inflammatory effects of TNF-α ( Figures S3 C–S3F).
We next experimentally validated that the putative CB1 antagonist genistein prevents vascular dysfunction caused by Δ 9 -THC. We screened a series of antioxidant reagents and found that genistein was the best at preventing Δ 9 -THC-induced oxidative stress in hiPSC-ECs ( Figures 5 C and S4 A). In hiPSC-ECs, genistein ameliorated the expression profile of antioxidant genes suppressed by Δ 9 -THC while also having a salutatory effect on NOS2 and NOX1 expression ( Figure 5 D).
With an attenuated inflammatory profile, we postulated that hiPSC-ECs treated with genistein and Δ 9 -THC were more likely to remain quiescent without contributing to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We tested this hypothesis using monocyte adhesion assays. Genistein not only reversed Δ 9 -THC-induced monocyte adhesion to hiPSC-ECs but also attenuated NF-κB phosphorylation ( Figures 5 E and 5F).
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are components of the innate immune system that recognize molecular patterns of microbial components, and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways can contribute to vascular inflammation in endothelial cells ( Akira et al., 2006 1. Akira, S. ∙ Uematsu, S. ∙ Takeuchi, O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity Cell. 2006; 124 :783-801 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9536) PubMed Google Scholar ). We, therefore, investigated the effects of Δ 9 -THC and the anti-inflammatory properties of genistein on the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. We observed that Δ 9 -THC induced TLR4 expression in hiPSC-ECs, whereas genistein disrupted its expression ( Figures 5 F and S4 B). Moreover, genistein reversed the Δ 9 -THC-induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines ( Figure S4 C). Cotreatment with genistein also shortened the recovery time of Δ 9 -THC-induced inflammation from 8–10 days to 4–6 days ( Figure 5 G), and treatment with genistein after Δ 9 -THC exposure also reduced the recovery time to 6–8 days ( Figure S4 D). These experimental results indicated that genistein attenuated Δ 9 -THC-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in hiPSC-ECs.
To evaluate the effects of genistein in vivo , male C57BL/6J mice were treated with vehicle, Δ 9 -THC, or Δ 9 -THC plus genistein ( Figure 6 A). While oral ingestion or smoking are more common routes of ingestion in humans, our mouse model produced a plasma concentration of Δ 9 -THC of ∼100 ng/mL as revealed by LC-MS analysis, which is comparable to the concentration from smoking a single marijuana cigarette ( Huestis and Cone, 2004 36.

Wire myograph revealed that Δ 9 -THC induced endothelial dysfunction in mice, whereas genistein mitigated the effect ( Figure 6 B).
Genistein and the known CB1 antagonist rimonabant ameliorated mRNA expressions of inflammation-related genes induced by Δ 9 -THC in mouse thoracic artery tissues ( Figures 6 C and S5 C). Analysis of C57BL/6J plasma revealed that IL-6, IL-3, and IL-10, which are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis ( Ridker et al., 2018 70. Ridker, P.M. ∙ Libby, P. ∙ Macfadyen, J.G. ...

Genistein also rescued the oxidative stress protective-related gene expression ( Figure 6 D). Expression of inflammation and oxidative stress protective-related genes was correlated with vascular relaxation ( Figure S5 E). NF-κB phosphorylation and SOD expression in mouse serum were also attenuated with genistein ( Figures 6 E, 6F, and S5 F). Δ 9 -THC administration decreased circulating levels of the antioxidant glutathione, which was ameliorated with genistein cotreatment ( Figures 6 G–6J). Collectively, these results indicated that genistein could reverse Δ 9 -THC-induced effects in vivo .
While genistein had a protective effect on the vasculature, it did not exhibit any toxicity based on body weight and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of various organs ( Figure S5 G). We used engineered heart tissues (EHTs) composed of hiPSC-ECs and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to interrogate the effects of genistein and Δ 9 -THC on contractility in vitro ( Videos S1 , S2 , and S3 ). We found Δ 9 -THC and genistein cotreatment had no significant effect on contraction, relaxation, and peak force ( Figures S2 B, S2C, and S2F). Δ 9 -THC decreased beat rate and increased the contraction-relaxation interval, and genistein cotreatment did not attenuate these effects ( Figures S2 D and S2E). Bulk RNA sequencing analysis of EHT did not reveal any significant transcriptomic signature implicated in cardiac function, but some pathways were downregulated in response to Δ 9 -THC treatment compared with vehicle control ( Figure S2 G). Reflecting the EHT studies, echocardiographic analysis of C57BL/6J revealed that Δ 9 -THC, genistein, and cotreatment with genistein did not affect cardiac structure or function ( Figures S6 M–S6P), with no significant difference in ejection fraction (EF), heart rate (HR), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular end-diastolic mass (LVEDM). The CB1 antagonist rimonabant, however, reduced HR when used alone or in cotreatment with Δ 9 -THC but did not affect other cardiac parameters.

To investigate the effect of Δ 9 -THC and genistein in chronic atherosclerosis formation, LDL receptor knockout mice (B6.129S7-Ldlr tm1Her/J ) were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and treated with (1) vehicle control, (2) Δ 9 -THC, or (3) Δ 9 -THC and genistein (n = 10–12/group) ( Figure 6 K). All groups showed an increase in body weight during the HFD period ( Figure S7 A). The successful administration of Δ 9 -THC was confirmed in serum by LC-MS at 12 weeks ( Figures S7 B and S7C). Neither Δ 9 -THC nor cotreatment with Δ 9 -THC and genistein affected serum lipid profiles or blood pressure ( Figures S7 D and S7E). After 12 weeks of HFD, the mice were euthanized, and the atherosclerotic lesion area was examined by cross-sections of the aortic root and an en face analysis of the thoracic aorta. In the cross-sectional analysis, mice treated with Δ 9 -THC showed significantly increased plaque size, and cotreatment with genistein ameliorated plaque size when stained with oil red O ( Figures 6 L and 6M). The improvement of plaque formation by genistein was also observed in en face analysis of the thoracic aorta stained with oil red O ( Figures S7 F and S7G). Macrophage recruitment in the aortic root was analyzed using aortic plaque stained with an anti-CD68 antibody. The CD68-positive area was significantly increased by Δ 9 -THC administration and rescued by cotreatment with genistein ( Figures 6 N and 6O). These results suggest that Δ 9 -THC exacerbated atherosclerosis formation and macrophage recruitment in atherosclerotic plaques, which were ameliorated by genistein cotreatment.
An Apoe −/− mouse model was also employed to investigate the effects of Δ 9 -THC and cotreatment with genistein on atherosclerosis. Partial carotid artery ligation (PCAL) was performed in Apoe −/− mice at 10–16 weeks. After PCAL, the Apoe −/− mice were divided into three groups: (1) vehicle control, (2) Δ 9 -THC, and (3) Δ 9 -THC plus genistein (n = 5/group). All mice were fed a HFD for 10 days ( Figure 6 P). At the end of the treatment protocol, the Apoe −/− mice were euthanized and subjected to histological analysis. The ligated carotid artery showed increased fat deposition with oil red O staining compared with the unligated, contralateral vessel ( Figure S6 J). H&E staining suggested neointimal thickening, fat deposition, and increased macrophage recruitment in ligated carotid atherosclerotic plaques ( Figure 6 Q). Oil red O staining found that the plaque area was increased by Δ 9 -THC treatment, whereas Δ 9 -THC and genistein cotreatment ameliorated the plaque size ( Figure 6 R). Macrophage recruitment was tested using the macrophage-specific F4/80 antibody and CD68 antibody ( Figures S6 K and S6L). In the ligated carotid artery, the F4/80-positive area was significantly increased by Δ 9 -THC administration and decreased by cotreatment with genistein. Immunohistochemical analysis with CD68-specific antibody revealed that the CD68-positive area was significantly increased by Δ 9 -THC administration and reduced by cotreatment with genistein. Consistent with the Ldlr −/− model findings, the Apoe −/ − PCAL mouse model found increased plaque size and increased macrophage recruitment with Δ 9 -THC, and genistein cotreatment ameliorated these indices of atherosclerosis in ligated carotid arteries.
After finding that genistein attenuated the vascular dysfunction caused by Δ 9 -THC in both in vitro and in vivo studies, we found direct evidence of genistein-binding CB1 using fluorescently labeled genistein (BODIPY517/547-genistein) ( Figures 7 A and 7B). In CB1 radioligand binding assays, BODIPY517/547-genistein had an IC 50 of 375 nM on human CB1 receptors and labeled nearly all hiPSC-ECs cells after 12 h incubation ( Figure 7 C). BODIPY517/547-genistein cotreatment attenuates Δ 9 -THC-induced inflammation-related gene expression and NF-κB phosphorylation and ameliorates oxidative stress protective-related gene expression, SOD expression, and glutathione concentration in mouse serum ( Figures S6 A–S6I). In vivo binding was investigated using intravenously injected BODIPY517/547-genistein in C57BL/6J mice. After 48 h, BODIPY517/547-genistein was detected in the abdominal viscera, thoracic aorta, heart, and lungs but was minimally detected in the brain ( Figures 7 D–7G). This is consistent with a previous report that shows genistein has poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration ( Yang et al., 2012 83. Yang, Z. ∙ Kulkarni, K. ∙ Zhu, W. ... Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of genistein: mechanistic studies on its ADME Anticancer. Agents Med. Chem. 2012; 12 :1264-1280 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next investigated whether genistein is co-localized with the CB1 receptor in vivo using confocal microscopy. Thoracic aortas from mice injected with BODIPY517/547-genistein were permeabilized and stained with an anti-CB1 receptor antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. The mice were imaged with confocal microscopy, and z stacked images revealed co-localization of Alexa Fluor-488-labeled CB1 receptor and BODIPY517/547-genistein in aortic vascular cells ( Figures 7 H and 7I). The specificity of genistein binding was interrogated by injecting the selective CB1 antagonist rimonabant before BODIPY517/547-genistein. Rimonabant has a stronger binding affinity for the CB1 receptor and reduced BODIPY517/547-genistein binding and fluorescence significantly (0.78 ± 0.08 versus 0.13 ± 0.04, p < 0.00001) ( Figure 7 J).
Despite BODIPY517/547 having excellent bioavailability ( Kwon et al., 2021 41. Kwon, Y.D. ∙ Byun, Y. ∙ Kim, H.K. 18F-labelled BODIPY dye as a dual imaging agent: Radiofluorination and applications in PET and optical imaging Nucl. Med. Biol. 2021; 93 :22-36 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), genistein has poor BBB penetration, which compelled us to interrogate the neurological effects of Δ 9 -THC in the context of genistein co-administration. The neurobehavioral effects of Δ 9 -THC include decreased mobility, analgesia, hypothermia, and sedation. These are described as the Billy Martin tetrad ( Little et al., 1988 45. Little, P.J. ∙ Compton, D.R. ∙ Johnson, M.R. ... Pharmacology and stereo selectivity of structurally novel cannabinoids in mice J.Pharmacol. Exp.Ther. 1988; 247 :1046-1051 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fride et al., 2006 26. Fride, E. ∙ Perchuk, A. ∙ Hall, F.S. ... Behavioral methods in cannabinoid research Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 123 :269-290 PubMed Google Scholar ; Wiley and Martin, 2003 82. Wiley, J.L. ∙ Martin, B.R. Cannabinoid pharmacological properties common to other centrally acting drugs Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 471 :185-193 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sedative and analgesic effects of Δ 9 -THC may have therapeutic benefit ( Gurley et al., 1998 30. Gurley, R.J. ∙ Aranow, R. ∙ Katz, M. Medicinal marijuana: a comprehensive review J.Psychoactive Drugs. 1998; 30 :137-147 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). While protecting against the detrimental vascular effects, genistein may antagonize the neurobehavioral tetrad effects of Δ 9 -THC. Therefore, the neurological effects of Δ 9 -THC and genistein co-administration were tested in C57BL/6J mice treated with vehicle, genistein, Δ 9 -THC, or in combination. The tetrad effects were assessed using an activity chamber for mobility, a hot plate for analgesia, a rectal probe for hypothermia, and the bar test for sedation. Δ 9 -THC caused decreased mobility, analgesia, hypothermia, and sedation in C57BL/6J mice ( Figures S7 H–S7K). Genistein alone did not affect tetrad effects, and genistein could not attenuate the Δ 9 -THC neurobehavioral effects in cotreatment.

Section: Discussion

With expanding legalization, marijuana use is expected to increase ( Cerdá et al., 2020 14. Cerdá, M. ∙ Mauro, C. ∙ Hamilton, A. ... Association Between recreational marijuana legalization in the United States and changes in marijuana use and cannabis use disorder From 2008 to 2016 JAMA Psychiatry. 2020; 77 :165-171 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). The long-term cardiovascular implications of cannabis are unclear and may take decades to percolate up through epidemiological studies ( Pope et al., 2004 66.

Recently, DeFillipis et al. found in a cohort of 2,097 patients that marijuana is associated with MI in young adults when controlling for demographic factors ( DeFilippis et al., 2018 21. Defilippis, E.M. ∙ Singh, A. ∙ Divakaran, S. ... Cocaine and marijuana use among young adults with myocardial infarction J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2018; 71 :2540-2551 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, the UK Biobank data of 34,878 participants also found marijuana to be associated with MI. Several studies have also identified that the CB1 receptor mediates increased oxidative stress and inflammation as implicated in diabetic retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and endothelial dysfunction ( Bayazit et al., 2017 8. Bayazit, H. ∙ Selek, S. ∙ Karababa, I.F. ... Evaluation of oxidant/antioxidant status and cytokine levels in patients with cannabis use disorder Clin. Psychopharmacol.

Cannabinoid 1 receptor promotes cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy Diabetes. 2012; 61 :716-727 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). CB1 activation occurs via the MAP kinase pathway, which causes oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death in human coronary artery endothelial cells ( Liu et al., 2000 46.

Peroxiredoxin 2 deficiency exacerbates atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice Circ.Res. 2011; 109 :739-749 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we confirmed that Δ 9 -THC activation of CB1 causes inflammation and oxidative stress via MAP kinase, TNF-α, and NF-kB pathways ( Figures 6 C–6E, S2 H, S7 l, and S7M). Now, for the first time, we show the link between Δ 9 -THC-mediated vascular inflammation and oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis using two independent mouse models. ( Figures 6 K–6R and S6 J–S6P). Using in silico compound screening combined with wet bench validation, we discovered that genistein, a neutral CB1 antagonist, attenuates Δ 9 -THC-induced endothelial dysfunction.
Δ 9 -THC and CBD are the two principal components of marijuana. Our focus is on Δ 9 -THC. While CBD can undergo intramolecular cyclization to form Δ 9 -THC, CBD does not exert toxicity, and CBD might have therapeutic benefits ( Pacher et al., 2018 61. Pacher, P. ∙ Steffens, S. ∙ Haskó, G. ... Cardiovascular effects of marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids: the good, the bad, and the ugly Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2018; 15 :151-166 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rajesh et al., 2010a 68. Rajesh, M. ∙ Mukhopadhyay, P. ∙ Bátkai, S. ... Cannabidiol attenuates cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and inflammatory and cell death signaling pathways in diabetic cardiomyopathy J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2010; 56 :2115-2125 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ). Δ 9 -THC and CBD exert divergent responses, and because both are components of marijuana, their combined effects on the cardiovascular system merit further investigation. CB1 antagonists may have therapeutic effects, but the psychiatric side effects have largely thwarted their translation to the clinic ( Onakpoya et al., 2016 59. Onakpoya, I.J. ∙ Heneghan, C.J. ∙ Aronson, J.K. Worldwide withdrawal of medicinal products because of adverse drug reactions: a systematic review and analysis Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2016; 46 :477-489 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moreira et al., 2009 53. Moreira, F.A. ∙ Grieb, M. ∙ Lutz, B. Central side-effects of therapies based on CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists: focus on anxiety and depression Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 23 :133-144 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we discovered that genistein, a neutral CB1 antagonist, attenuated the adverse effects of Δ 9 -THC on the vasculature without the psychiatric side effects seen in some other CB1 antagonists. Taken together, the in vivo binding assay and neurobehavioral analysis suggest that genistein inhibits CB1 activity peripherally and has a lower CNS penetration ( Gleason et al., 2009 28. Gleason, C.E. ∙ Carlsson, C.M. ∙ Barnet, J.H. ... A preliminary study of the safety, feasibility and cognitive efficacy of soy isoflavone supplements in older men and women Age Ageing. 2009; 38 :86-93 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A pan-assay interference compound (PAIN) or invalid metabolic panacea (IMP) is a chemical compound that gives false-positive results in biochemical assays through various mechanisms ( Baell and Holloway, 2010 6. Baell, J.B. ∙ Holloway, G.A. New substructure filters for removal of pan assay interference compounds (PAINS) from screening libraries and for their exclusion in bioassays J. Med. Chem. 2010; 53 :2719-2740 Crossref Scopus (2901) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genistein is a PAIN and/or an IMP ( Bisson et al., 2016 9. Bisson, J. ∙ Mcalpine, J.B. ∙ Friesen, J.B. ... Can invalid bioactives undermine natural product-based drug discovery? J. Med. Chem. 2016; 59 :1671-1690 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, it can aggregate, act as a membrane disruptor, and interfere with luciferase in luminescence-reporting assays. Genistein has a protective effect against Δ 9 -THC, but we cannot exclude the possibility that genistein may function via other additional mechanisms independent of the CB1 receptor pathway.
The enthusiasm for using Δ 9 -THC medically in such applications as sedation, analgesia, or anti-nausea ( Hill et al., 2017 34. Hill, K.P. ∙ Palastro, M.D. ∙ Johnson, B. ... Cannabis and pain: A clinical review Cannabis Cannabinoid Res. 2017; 2 :96-104 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Badowski, 2017 5. Badowski, M.E. A review of oral cannabinoids and medical marijuana for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a focus on pharmacokinetic variability and pharmacodynamics Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2017; 80 :441-449 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cotter, 2009 19. Cotter, J. Efficacy of crude marijuana and synthetic Delta-9-tetrahydro cannabinol as treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: A systematic literature review Oncol. Nurs. Forum. 2009; 36 :345-352 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Baron, 2015 7. Baron, E.P. Comprehensive review of medicinal marijuana, cannabinoids, and therapeutic implications in medicine and headache: what a long strange trip it's been Headache. 2015; 55 :885-916 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ) should also be tempered by the awareness of increased cardiovascular risk. This study shows that Δ 9 -THC might cause adverse cardiovascular effects based on collective data from the UK Biobank, hiPSC-ECs, murine model, and increased atherogenic inflammatory cytokines found in the plasma of marijuana smokers. Clinicians must balance the therapeutic benefits of marijuana with the potential for adverse cardiovascular consequences mediated by Δ 9 -THC oxidative stress and inflammation. Because of its limited bioavailability in the brain, genistein could mitigate the adverse cardiovascular effects of Δ 9 -THC and preserve the therapeutic benefits of marijuana that are thought to be centrally mediated.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that Δ 9 -THC induces inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis through the CB1-dependent signaling pathway. Thus, CB1 antagonists could attenuate Δ 9 -THC-induced inflammation and may prevent atherosclerosis, but the psychiatric effects are concerning. We show that the neutral CB1 antagonist, genistein, can attenuate the adverse effects of Δ 9 -THC on the cardiovascular system while preserving the beneficial central effects of Δ 9 -THC. Further exploration of compounds with homology to genistein is expected to yield more potent CB1 antagonists with similar safety profiles as genistein.
In the present study, genistein was discovered to be a ligand for the CB1 receptor using the SWEATLEAD database ( Moshiri et al., 2020 54. Moshiri, J. ∙ Constant, D.A. ∙ Liu, B. ... A targeted computational screen of the SWEETLEAD database reveals FDA-approved compounds with anti-dengue viral activity mBio. 2020; 11 e02839–20 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ), which has been validated with virtual-ligand receptor modeling using the Schrödinger suite. We have also conducted wet bench experiments to validate this finding using hiPSC-ECs and a mouse model. iPSCs are a powerful system for modeling disease because they can provide a limitless source of tissue. However, iPSC-ECs are immature, having low eNOS expression and are a mixture of arterial, venous, and lymphatic ECs. Therefore, it was imperative to validate the effects observed in the iPSC-ECs with primary endothelial cells and murine models.
The clinical data from the UK Biobank and the Olink inflammation panel show an increased incidence of MI and acute upregulation of inflammatory cytokines associated with CVD. The Olink data inflammatory markers are associated with MI and are correlative. The UK Biobank study was carried out between 2000 and 2016 when marijuana smoking was illegal. Despite concerns about participants not disclosing illicit cannabis use, an increased incidence of cardiovascular events with a worse prognosis was observed among cannabis users. While cannabis is an independent risk factor when controlled for age and BMI, the confounder of tobacco abuse could not be addressed due to the sample size of the UK Biobank cohort and individuals underreporting illicit cannabis use. The study by DeFilippis et al. showed a significant association between marijuana and CVD in patients presenting with index MI ( DeFilippis et al., 2018 21. Defilippis, E.M. ∙ Singh, A. ∙ Divakaran, S. ... Cocaine and marijuana use among young adults with myocardial infarction J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2018; 71 :2540-2551 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). The confounder of cigarette smoking is also noted in the DeFilippis et al. study. However, when adjusted for baseline characteristics including cigarette smoking, the DeFilippis et al. study showed that the hazard ratio for marijuana and cardiovascular events was higher than smoking traditional cigarettes alone.

We first determined the number of individuals in the UK Biobank who were cannabis users versus non-cannabis users ( http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=20453 ). We identified individuals who responded “no” to having never used cannabis as non-cannabis users. The remaining responses were then segregated based on cannabis frequency use. We identified individuals who responded “yes” to cannabis use more than once a month as cannabis users. We then identified the number of cannabis users and non-cannabis reported as having a previous episode of myocardial infarction (MI). The phenotype of MI was defined according to previously published analyses and criteria. The incidence of MI in cannabis and non-cannabis users was then determined by taking the ratio of cannabis users who developed MI to the total number of cannabis users and the ratio of non-cannabis users who developed MI to the total number of non-cannabis users. To determine the incidence of MI in cannabis and non-cannabis users under the age of 50, we followed the same procedure as described above but only analyzed cannabis and non-cannabis users under the age of 50 at the time of the survey.
To develop a logistic regression model, we created a dataset from the UK Biobank of individuals who had developed MI versus those who had not developed MI. Each individual in the dataset was then annotated with information regarding their cannabis use, sex, BMI, and age. The dataset was then used to fit a logistic regression model using the “glm()” function, which fits generalized linear models including logistic regressions, in R version 3.5.3. Coefficients of the model included cannabis use, sex, BMI, and age. Using the p-value, we then identified coefficients that had a statistically significant predictive factor on the development of MI. The analyses were performed using the UK Biobank data as of April 2021.
Twenty recreational marijuana smokers were previously recruited to smoke a single marijuana cigarette and had serial blood draws to assess for Δ 9 -THC levels in plasma ( Lynch et al., 2019 47. Lynch, K.L. ∙ Luo, Y.R. ∙ Hooshfar, S. ... Correlation of breath and blood Δ9-tetrahydro cannabinol concentrations and release kinetics following controlled administration of smoked cannabis Clin. Chem. 2019; 65 :1171-1179 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Patient demographics were previously reported ( Lynch et al., 2019 47. Lynch, K.L. ∙ Luo, Y.R. ∙ Hooshfar, S. ... Correlation of breath and blood Δ9-tetrahydro cannabinol concentrations and release kinetics following controlled administration of smoked cannabis Clin. Chem. 2019; 65 :1171-1179 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Participants abstained from using marijuana for 24 hr before testing. Two participants were excluded from subsequent plasma analyses because they did not consent to the study. The remaining participants gave consent. Plasma was isolated from 18 individuals using sodium citrate tubes at 15 min intervals from 0 min to 180 min and frozen at -80 °C. The Olink Target 96 Inflammation panel was used to identify changes in the production of 92 common inflammatory cytokines ( Sun et al., 2018 76. Sun, B.B. ∙ Maranville, J.C. ∙ Peters, J.E. ... Genomic atlas of the human plasma proteome Nature. 2018; 558 :73-79 Crossref Scopus (1014) PubMed Google Scholar ) from the blood samples at 0 min, 90 min, and 180 min. The Olink platform is based on proximity extension assay (PEA) following target recognition by antibodies and was performed by the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Core following the manufacturer’s protocols. Internal and external controls were included to establish detection limits. Data were measured as the Olink normalized protein extension (NPX) values, and proteins with missing values or below the limits of detection in ≥33% of samples were excluded. Differential protein abundance was compared using limma ( Ritchie et al., 2015 71. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... Limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21698) PubMed Google Scholar ) with subject and time as factors. Proteins with adjusted p values ≤0.1 at 90 min vs. 0 min were considered statistically significant.
We obtained the following: human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), normal human cardiac fibroblasts-ventricular (NHCF-V) cells, human erythroleukemia (HEL 92.1.7), and human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-FI) from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) were differentiated from the Wicell H7 line. The hiPSC-derived neurons were provided by Dr. Thomas Sudhof (Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University). TNFα and genistein treatment of hiPSC-ECs were performed on hiPSCs from healthy control line 1 or CRISPRi knockdown of CNR1. The hiPSCs were differentiated into hiPSC-ECs and treated with vehicle, 10 ng/ml TNFα, or 10 μM genistein. Gene expression was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
hiPSC lines were obtained from the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute Biobank. Patients were enrolled under the Stanford Institutional Review Board and StemCell Research Oversight Committee guidelines. All volunteers gave consent. hiPSCs were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 anonymous healthy individuals (age range from 26 to 51; 3 males and 1 female) using Sendai virus (CytoTuneTM-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) ( Key Resource Table ). hiPSCs were dissociated using 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS (Innovative Cell Technologies, CA) and plated as single cells in E8 medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Selleck Chemicals) on Matrigel to a final density of 20,000-30,000 cells/cm 2 . hiPSC-ECs were differentiated using a protocol previously described in our lab ( Paik et al., 2018 62. Paik, D.T. ∙ Tian, L. ∙ Lee, J. ... Large-scale single-cell RNA-Seq reveals molecular signatures of heterogeneous populations of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells Circ. Res. 2018; 123 :443-450 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the hiPSC monolayers were cultured to 85% cell confluency. Cells were then treated for 2 days with 6 μM CHIR99021 (Selleck Chemicals) in RPMI medium plus B27 supplement without insulin (Life Technologies). On day 2, cells were treated for 2 days with 2 μM CHIR99021 in RPMI plus B27 supplement without insulin. On day 4, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (rhFGF-2) (PeproTech) and 20 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (R&D Systems) for EC expansion for 8 days. On day 12, cells were harvested by Trypsin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and sorted using anti-CD144 MicroBeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The differentiation efficiency was calculated by the number of CD144-positive cells. hiPSC-ECs were cultured in gelatin-coated (Sigma Aldrich) 6-well plates in EGM-2 medium (Lonza).
Beating cardiomyocytes generated from hiPSC lines SCVI 854 and SCVI 951 (at day 22 of differentiation culture) were washed twice with PBS and digested with TrypLE™ Select (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1217703) for 10 min at 37 °C (5% CO 2 ). The dissociated cells were washed (PBS without Ca 2 + or Mg 2+ ; centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min) and re-suspended in RPMI/B27 medium and cell concentration adjusted to 1 × 10 6 cells/ml. Similarly, hiPSC-ECs from both lines frozen at passage 1 (P1) were thawed and expanded on 0.2% gelatin-coated dishes with EGM-2 medium. The cell types were mixed in a 7:3 ratio to a final cell concentration of 2 × 10 6 cells/ml. Fibrin-based human engineered heart tissues (EHTs) were generated using commercially available Teflon spacers and EHT silicone racks (EHT Technologies GmbH). In brief, casting molds were generated with 2% agarose in sterile DI water in 24-well plates (Nunc, 122475). Teflon spacers were introduced into the molten agarose to form the casting mold. Cells (final concentration 2 × 10 6 cells/ml) were mixed with 100 μl/ml Matrigel (BD Bioscience, 256235), 5 mg/ml bovine fibrinogen (200 mg/ml in NaCl 0.9% [Sigma, F4753], with 50:50 RPMI/B27 and EGM-2 medium mix). EHTs were generated with 80 μl per EHT (1 × 10 6 cells) and 3 U/ml thrombin. The cell mix was pipetted into agarose casting molds, and silicone posts were carefully dipped into the gelation mix. After fibrin polymerization (37 °C, 2 hr), the silicone racks with attached fibrin gels were transferred to new 24-well plates and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 . The culture medium was changed every 3 days and consisted of RPMI/B27 and EGM-2 (80:20), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 15 μg/ml aprotinin. After 5 days in culture, human EHTs displayed spontaneous coherent, regular beating deflecting the silicone posts, thus allowing for video-optical contraction analysis.
Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All small animal experiments were performed by protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Stanford University. The mice were treated with vehicle, Δ 9 -THC, or Δ 9 -THC plus genistein (n=5/group) for 30 days and then sacrificed. Organs were collected, weighed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The thoracic aortas (TAs) were surgically dissected out and cleaned from the surrounding connective tissue for all groups. The TAs were transferred to ice-cold Krebs’-Henseleit solution (in mM: 133 NaCl, 4.6 KCl, 2.5 CaCl 2 , 16.3 NaHCO 3 , 1.75 NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.6 MgSO 4 , 10 glucose) and cut into segments of 2 mm. The artery segments were mounted in wire-myograph chambers for isometric tension recordings (DanishMyo Technology [DMT]).The chambers contained Krebs’-Henseleit solution. All chambers were aerated with 95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 , and the temperature was kept constant at 37 °C to mimic physiological conditions. After a manual stabilization and normalization procedure, we used the PowerLab4/25-Chart7 acquisition systems (AD Instruments Ltd) to record force and convert it into tension. The TA segments were pre-constricted using either 1-3 μM 5HT serotonin (5HT) or U46619. A cumulative application of acetylcholine (1-10 μM) was performed, and the induced vascular dilatations were measured. Subsequently, concentration-response relationship curves were established for each group of 3 mice. Time-matched dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) application was performed in a separate chamber as the control for all experiments.
LDL receptor knockout mice (B6.129S7- Ldlrtm1Her/J ) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free animal facilities maintained by the Stanford University School of Medicine. The diet was switched to a high-fat diet (HFD; Research Diets, Inc) containing 40% fat and 1.25% cholesterol (modified D12079B) from 9-12 weeks of age for 12 weeks to accelerate atherosclerotic plaque formation. Δ 9 -THC (1 mg/kg/d) or vehicle (90% saline, 5% ethanol, 5% Cremophor) was administered using osmotic pumps (Alzet, model 2006). To achieve continuous administration of Δ 9 -THC, the mice underwent implantation of the first pumps one day before HFD was started, and in 6 weeks, they received the second pumps. Genistein (50 mg/kg/d) or vehicle (corn oil 100 μL/d, Sigma-Aldrich, C8267) was orally administered daily using a feeding needle (Fine Science Tools, 18065-20). Mice were euthanized at 12 weeks of HFD, and the aorta, heart, liver, and serum were harvested. Serum lipid profiles were measured at Stanford Animal Diagnostic Lab. Blood pressure was measured with CODA Non-Invasive Blood Pressure System (Kent Scientific). All experiment procedures were performed in compliance with guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare and approved by the Stanford APLAC protocol.
Apolipoprotein E knockout ( Apoe -/- ) mice (C57BL/6- ApoE em1Narl /Nail ) were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). An accelerated carotid atherosclerosis model was generated by performing partial carotid artery ligation (PCAL) in Apoe -/- mice fed a HFD ( Nam et al., 2009 58. Nam, D. ∙ Ni, C.W. ∙ Rezvan, A. ... Partial carotid ligation is a model of acutely induced disturbed flow, leading to rapid endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 297 :H1535-H1543 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, anesthesia was induced in Apoe -/- mice by intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-tribromeethanol (250 mg/kg i.p.). After shaving, a ventral midline incision (4 to 5 mm) was made in the neck. The left carotid artery (LCA) was exposed by blunt dissection. Three of four caudal branches of LCA including the left external carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, and occipital artery were ligated while the superior thyroid artery was left intact. The incision was then closed, and mice were monitored in a chamber on a heating pad following surgery until fully recovered. One day after PCAL, the mice were treated with vehicle, Δ 9 -THC, or Δ 9 -THC plus genistein (n=5/group) for 10 days. After sacrificing and pressure perfusion, the aorta and the carotid arteries were isolated and fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min. The aorta and carotids were immersed in a 30% sucrose solution for 24 hr and subsequently incubated in a 1:1 ratio of an optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and 30% sucrose solution for 1 h. The samples were embedded in OCT. Frozen embedded samples were sectioned with a cryostat in 8 μm thickness and stained with an Oil Red O Staining Kit (ScienCell Research Laboratories, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The plaque areas were calculated using ImageJ software. The extent of the carotid atherosclerosis was presented as plaque areas quantified on each carotid artery section.
To evaluate the in vivo biodistribution, BODIPY517/547-genistein (50 mg/kg) or rimonabant 100 nM followed 30 min later by BODIPY517/547-genistein (50 mg/kg) was intravenously injected into adult male BALB/c nude mice (n=5) and observed via the IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System (Xenogen) at 0.25, 1, 12, 24, and 48 h after injection. After 48 h, mice were sacrificed, and the main organs were collected for IVIS observation, including the brain, heart, lung, thoracic aorta, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, colon, and whole blood. Regions of photon intensity were quantified using the IVIS Image software.
The structures of 4 selective CB1 antagonists (rimonabant, otenabant, AM251, and DBPR-211) were used as lead compound candidates for high-throughput virtual screening. The selective CB1 antagonists were stripped of salts, and query structures were generated by BROOD (version 3.0, OpenEye Scientific Software). ROCS (version 2.3, OpenEye Scientific Software) was used for the high-throughput virtual screening with the SWEETLEAD cheminformatics database as the chemical library ( https://simtk.org/projects/sweetlead ). The top hits were ranked by combo Tanimoto and were selected from each CB1 antagonist.
The plasmids and SmartPool siRNA (Dharmacon) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 50% confluentcells in 6-well plates were transfected with plasmid or siRNA in 1 mL of serum-free medium for 6 h at 37 °C. Then, 1 mL of mediumcontaining 20% FBS was added to the transfection mixture. After 48 h, cells were treated with Δ 9 -THC for 48 h, and the mRNA expression of various genes was measured by qPCR. mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH. The single guide RNA sequences for CRISPRi were adapted from Human Genome-wide CRISPRi-v2 Libraries (Addgene #83969). The lentivirus expressing sgRNAs was generated with pMD2.G (Addgene #12259), psPAX2 (Addgene #12260), and a sgRNA plasmid (Addgene #60955) in HEK293T packaging cells (Takara Bio, 632180 Lenti-X™ 293T Cell Line), and infected into the CRISPRi hiPSCs ( Mandegar et al., 2016 49. Mandegar, M.A. ∙ Huebsch, N. ∙ Frolov, E.B. ... CRISPR interference efficiently induces specific and reversible gene silencing in human iPSCs Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18 :541-553 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, sgRNA-positive cells were selected with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) for 14 days. The hiPSCs were subsequently differentiated into endothelial cells. The CRISPRi system was induced by treating with doxycycline (2 μM) for 48 h. Afterward, cells were treated with Δ 9 -THC for 48 h, and the mRNA expression of various genes was measured by qPCRanalysis and normalized to GAPDH.
Protein-ligand docking studies were performed on the crystal structure of the human CB1 receptor (PDB: 5TGZ ). The X-ray structure of CB1-AM6538 was taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5TGZ ) ( Friesner et al., 2006 27. Friesner, R.A. ∙ Murphy, R.B. ∙ Repasky, M.P. ... Extra precision glide: docking and scoring incorporating a model of hydrophobic enclosure for protein-ligand complexes J.Med.Chem. 2006; 49 :6177-6196 Crossref Scopus (5204) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Schrodinger suite was used to prepare the protein by adding hydrogens and performing a restrained minimization using the default settings. The default force field, OPLS_2005, was used for all minimizations. The Glide module was used to dock the flexible ligands to the rigid binding site without constraints using the default settings ( Halgren et al., 2004 31. Halgren, T.A. ∙ Murphy, R.B. ∙ Friesner, R.A. ... Glide: a new approach for rapid, accurate docking and scoring. 2. Enrichment factors in database screening J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (3916) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting GlideScores were used to estimate and rank the binding energy of the ligands.
Cells were seeded at 3,000 cells/well in 96-well plates, maintained for 14-16 h, and then treated with test compounds. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS, and then the medium containing CellTiter-Glo® Reagent (Promega) was diluted 1:1 with culture medium for 30 min at room temperature. The relative luminescence units (RLU) were recorded with a plate reader (Promega GloMax Multi Detection System). The half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) of cell viability was calculated by SigmaPlot software (Systat Software).
Cells were seeded at 3,000 cells/well in 96-well plates, maintained for 14-16 h, and then treated with the test compound. The H 2 O 2 substrate solution was added to the supernatant. The plate was returned to the incubator for an additional 6 h of treatment. ROS-Glo Detection Solution was added to each well and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity was measured with a plate reader (Promega GloMax Multi Detection System).
U937 monocytes were fluorescence-labeled using Calcein-AM (100 μM, 1 × 10 6 cells; R&D Systems). Endothelial cells were seeded at 3,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and maintained for 14-16 h, then treated with test compounds. After 48 h, monocytes were added and co-cultured with hiPSC-ECs for 30 min at 37 °C. The wells were washed three times with PBS to remove non-adherentcells. Cells were viewed with fluorescence microscopy, and spectrofluorometric quantification was performed at 492 nm (excitation) and 535 nm (emission) on a 96-well plate reader (BioteckCytation 5).
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and maintained for 14-16 h, and treated with test compounds. After 48 h, trypsinized cells were cultured at a density of 1x10 5 on Matrigel basement membrane matrix, and tube formation was analyzed after 12 h. Cumulative tube length was quantified from microscopic images taken from 3 random fields for each condition. Quantification was performed with Wimasis image analysis software.
Total RNA was isolated by Trizol reagent. Reverse transcription reaction was performed by 2 μg of total RNA, which was reverse transcribed into cDNA using oligo-dT. qPCR analysis was performed with cDNA samples using the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH.
Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer, and lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE using polyacrylamide gels. Western blot was done as described previously ( Lee et al., 2019 43. Lee, J. ∙ Termglinchan, V. ∙ Diecke, S. ... Activation of PDGF pathway links LMNA mutation to dilated cardiomyopathy Nature. 2019; 572 :335-340 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunoblotting was performed using specific antibodies to evaluate the expression of different proteins.
Cells were seeded at 3,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and maintained for 14-16 h, then treated with test compounds. After 48 h, CellROX® Reagent was added at a final concentration of 5 μM, and the plate was returned to the incubator for 30 min. The medium was removed and washed times with PBS. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, stained with DAPI for 15 min, and were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 780 microscope. The results were analyzed using LSM version software.
Atherosclerotic lesions were quantified by cross-sectional analysis of the aortic root and en face analysis of the thoracic aorta ( Yun et al., 2017 84. Yun, T.J. ∙ Lee, J.S. ∙ Shim, D. ... Isolation and characterization of aortic dendritic cells and lymphocytes in atherosclerosis Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1559 :419-437 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ; Baba et al., 2021 4. Baba, O. ∙ Huang, L.H. ∙ Elvington, A. ... CXCR4-binding positron emission tomography tracers link monocyte recruitment and endothelial injury in murine atherosclerosis Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2021; 41 :822-836 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). The heart, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta were collected and fixed in 4% PFA overnight. For cross-sectioning of the aortic root, the samples were cut at the mid-ventricle level and above the aortic root, incubated in 40% sucrose overnight, and then embedded in OCT. The OCT-embedded aortas were sectioned using a cryostat, and 20-μm sections were obtained at the aortic root level in which three valve leaflets are observed. For Oil Red O staining of the aortic-root sections, the sections were pretreated with 100% propylene glycol (1,2-Propanediol; Sigma-Aldrich, 398039) for 2 min, incubated with 0.5% Oil Red O solution (Sigma-Aldrich, O0625) for 10 min at room temperature, washed with 85% propylene glycol and distilled water, and then counterstained with Mayer's Modified Hematoxylin solution. For en face analysis of the aorta, the thoracic aortas were pretreated with 100% propylene glycol for 15 min, incubated with 0.5% oil red O solution for 3 h at room temperature, washed with 85% propylene glycol, and then washed with PBS. After staining, aortas were placed between 2 transparent sheets and imaged with a stereomicroscope and a digital camera.
Adult male BALB/c nude mice (n=5) were treated with BODIPY517/547-genistein (50 mg/kg) for 48 h and then sacrificed. En face immunofluorescence staining of vascular endothelial cells in mice was performed as previously described ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, C. ∙ Liu, Z.H. ∙ Chen, J.W. ... Using enface immunofluorescence staining to observe vascular endothelial cells directly J. Vis. Exp. 2019; 150 Google Scholar ). Briefly, the thoracic aortas were isolated and permeabilized by Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Next, tissues were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in TBS buffer containing 2.5% polysorbate 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Tissues were then exposed to an anti-CB1 antibody (Cayman Chemical) for 12 h at 4 °C and then exposed to Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The tissues were then placed on a coverslip with the luminal surface downward and moved slowly to the antifade mounting solution previously dropped on the coverslip. Fluorescence images were viewed by a confocal microscope system (Zeiss LSM 780), and tissues were observed through a series of z-stack images. The results of co-localized pixels were analyzed using LSM version software.
The radioligand binding assay on the human CB1 receptor was performed by Eurofins Discovery (St Charles, MO). Briefly, human recombinant Chem-1 cells were used, and cells were incubated with 2 nM [3H] SR141716A, 2.4 nM [3H] WIN-55,212-2, or 0.5 nM [3H] Estradiol for 90 min at 37 °C. Non-specific binding was estimated in the presence of 10 μM CP-55,940, 10 μM R(+)-WIN-55,212-2, or 1 μM diethylstilbestrol. Test compounds were prepared in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5% BSA) with serial dilution. Membranes were filtered and washed four times, and the filters were counted to determine specifically bound radioligand. IC 50 values were determined by a non-linear, least squares regression analysis using the MathIQTM statistical software (ID Business Solutions Ltd., UK). The inhibition constants (Ki) values were calculated by the Cheng-Prussoff equation using the observed IC 50 of the tested compound, the concentration of radioligand employed in the assay, and the historical values for the dissociation constants of the ligand.
The radioligand assay for the mouse receptor was performed by Gifford Biosciences Limited (Birmingham, UK).
Frozen tissues were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 5 mM MgCl 2 ; 5 mM EDTA; protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at 100 x g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove large debris. Supernatants were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to isolate pellets containing the membranes. The membranes were resuspended in wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 5 mM MgCl 2 ; 5 mM EDTA), centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.4 ml wash buffer containing 10% sucrose and stored at 80 °C. Protein content was analyzed using the Sigma® BCA assay. On the day of the assay, the membrane preparations were thawed, and the pellet resuspended in the final assay buffer.
Filtration binding assays were carried out in 96-well plates in a final volume of 250 μL per well. Each well had 150 μL membranes, 50 μL of the competing unlabeled compound or buffer, and 50 μL radioligand solution ([ 3 H]CP55940; 108.45 Ci/mmol (PerkinElmer, 2795349). The plate was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min with gentle agitation. The incubation was stopped by vacuum filtration onto presoaked (buffer with 1% BSA) GF/C filters using a 96-well FilterMate™ harvester and subsequently washed five times with ice-cold wash buffer. Filters were then dried under a warm air stream, sealed in polyethylene, scintillation cocktail added, and the radioactivity counted in a Wallac® TriLux1450 MicroBeta counter.
For each drug concentration, non-specific binding was subtracted from total binding to give specific binding. Data were fitted using the non-linear curve fitting routines in Prism® (Graphpad Software Inc) to obtain IC 50 values. Ki was calculated from the IC 50 values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.
This assay was performed by the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University using a Mouse 48 plex ProcartaPlex TM kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EPX480-20834-901) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, beads were added to a 96-well plate and washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer. Mouse EDTA Plasma samples were diluted 3-fold, added to the plate containing the mixed antibody-linked beads, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Following overnight incubation, plates were washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer. Then biotinylated detection antibody was added for 1 h at ambient temperature (22°C) with shaking, followed by washing and the addition of streptavidin-PE, incubation for 30 min, and a final washing. Each sample was measured in duplicate on a Flex Map FM3D instrument with a lower bound of 50 beads per sample per cytokine and with the aid of custom Assay Chex control beads (Radix BioSolutions). Output MFI data were transformed to concentration in pg/ml using standards serially diluted and run in the assay. The resulting concentrations for cytokines/chemokines measured are reported here, and values below the detection limits in ≥33% of samples were excluded. Select cytokines' differential protein abundance was compared using a two-sample Wilcoxon test in R v.3.6.3.
Group housed, 6-7 weeks old, male C57Bl/6J mice from Jackson Laboratory were used in the study. Mice were ordered at 5-6 weeks old and handled for 3 days before testing. The mice were housed in a Stanford University animal facility with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (8:30 am light off, 8:30 am light on) and had free access to water and food. All behavioral tests were conducted during the animals’ dark cycle. All procedures followed National Institute of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC).
The mice were randomized into different dosing groups based on their body weight. Δ 9 -THC (20 mg/kg i.p.) and genistein (50 mg/kg p.o.) were used in the study. The vehicle for Δ 9 -THC was 5% ethanol, 5% Cremophor EL, and 90% saline (1:1:18 ratio). The vehicle for genistein was corn oil. Vehicle, Δ 9 -THC, and genistein were dosed at the same time according to their treatment groups: Group 1: n=8 Veh i.p.+ Veh p.o.; Group 2: n=9 THC (20 mg/kg i.p.) + Veh p.o.; Group 3: n=8 Veh i.p.+ Genistein (50 mg/kg p.o.); and Group 4: n=9 THC (20 mg/kg i.p.) + Genistein (50 mg/kg p.o.).
Body temperature and locomotor activity were measured on the same day. The body temperature was taken using a Rodent Rectal Temperature Probe-For Mouse with lubricant (Animal Temperature Controller, World Precision Instrument, Model ACT-2000) before dosing and 60 min post-dose. The locomotor assessment took place in an Open Field Activity Arena (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT. Model ENV-515) mounted with three planes of infrared detectors within a specially designed sound-attenuating chamber (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT. MED-017M-027). The arena was 43 cm (L) x 43 cm (W) x 30 cm (H) and the sound-attenuating chamber was 74 cm (L) x 60 cm (W) x 60 cm (H). The mice were dosed and immediately placed in the corner of the testing arena. They were allowed to explore the arena for 10 min under tracking by an automated tracking system. Parameters, including distance moved, velocity, rearing, and time spent in the periphery and center of the arena, were analyzed. The periphery was defined as the zone 5 cm away from the arena wall. The arena was cleaned with a 1% Virkon solution at the end of each trial.
A Hot Plate apparatus (IITC Inc. Model 39) set to 55 °C was used in the study. Mice were tested before dosing and 20 min post-dosing. The mice were placed on the hot plate and covered by a transparent glass cylinder that was 25 cm in height and 12 cm in diameter. A 30 sec maximum trial duration was used during the test to minimize the exposure of animals to painful stimuli and prevent permanent tissue damage from the heat. A remote foot-switch pad was used to control the start/stop/reset function. The latency to hind paw licking, flicking, or jumping was recorded.
The Bar test is the most commonly used test in psychopharmacological induced catalepsy, a condition characterized by a lack of response to external stimuli and muscular rigidity, wherein the limbs remain in whatever position they are placed ( Sanberg et al., 1988 73. Sanberg, P.R. ∙ Bunsey, M.D. ∙ Giordano, M. ... The catalepsy test: its ups and downs Behav.Neurosci. 1988; 102 :748-759 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ). A typical catalepsy test involves putting an animal in an unnatural position and recording the time it takes for the animal to correct itself. A small metal rod (0.7 cm diameter, 10 cm long) was suspended 3-5 cm above the table, and the forepaws of the mouse were placed on the bar. The total duration the mice spent with one or both paws on the bar in a catalepsy state was recorded for a total of 60 sec. If the mouse jumped over the bar, it was placed in the original position on the bar a maximum of 4 times. A score of zero second was assigned to the mice if they jumped over the bar a fifth time. Mice were tested once before dosing and 60 min post-dose.
All the reagents were commercially available and used without further purification unless indicated otherwise. All solvents were anhydrous grade unless indicated otherwise. All non-aqueous reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under a slight positive argon pressure unless noted otherwise. Reactions were magnetically stirred and monitored by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel. Flash chromatography was performed on silica gel of 60-200μm particle size. Yields were reported for spectroscopically pure compounds. Melting points were recorded on a Fargo MP-2D melting point apparatus. 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AV 600 (600 MHz), Bruker AV 500 (500 MHz), and Bruker AVIII 400 (400 MHz) spectrometers. Chemical shifts are given in δ values relative totetramethylsilane (TMS, δH = 0); coupling constants J are given in Hz. Internal standards were CDCl3 (δH = 7.24), CD3OD (δH = 3.31) or DMSO-d6 (δH = 2.49) for 1H NMR spectra and CDCl3 (δC = 77.0, central line of triplet), CD3OD (δC = 49.0, central line of septet) or DMSO-d6 (δC = 39.5, central line of septet) for 13C NMR spectra. The splitting patterns are reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), br (broad), and dd (double of doublets). High-resolution electrospray ionization (ESI) and fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra were recorded on a JMS-T100LP AccuTOF LC-plus 4G mass spectrometer.
Male C57BL/6J mice were treated with Δ 9 -THC, genistein, or their combination every day for 30 days (n=5/group). According to the manufacturer's instructions, all mice were sacrificed on day 30, and plasma was collected and analyzed by the Glutathione colorimetric assay kit (BioVision, K261). Briefly, a serial dilution of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) stock solutions was prepared as standards. Glutathione level was measured by the periodic reaction of 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The plate reader measured the absorbance with a wavelength of 405 nm after 10 min with ELISA. The detected reduced and oxidized GSH levels were normalized to the total serum content of the respective serum samples. Total glutathione level (GSH+GSSG) and the ratio of reduced GSH to oxidized GSH (GSH/GSSG ratio) were calculated.
Mice were treated with vehicle, genistein, Δ 9 -THC, or combination for 30 days and then sacrificed. Blood was collected with a cardiac puncture and plasma isolated using 5 mM EDTA. A 100 μl aliquot of plasma was transferred to a 1.5 ml microtube. The LC-MS analysis was performed by the Forensic and Clinical Toxicology Center at National Taiwan University. Briefly, protein precipitation was performed to remove the interference of proteins in serum samples by adding 20 μL 50% methanol (MeOH), and 60 μL IS solution in acetonitrile to 20 μL serum samples. 40 μL of supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 RCF for 10 min and dried with steam nitrogen. The resulting residues were reconstituted with 80 μL 50% MeOH and transferred to autosampler vials before LC-MS analysis. Analytical standards were prepared in MeOH as a stock solution at a concentration of 1000 μg/ml. Calibrators were prepared with series dilutions and spiked into a blank sample matrix. Calibration curves were constructed in a serum blank matrix with analytical ranges from 3.125 to 100 ng/ml. LC-MS analysis was performed with Agilent 1290 LC-Sciex 6500 QqQ system. A Biphenyl column was employed as an analytical column (100 x 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).
CB1 and Gi1 were purified as described previously ( Krishna Kumar et al., 2019 40. KrishnaKumar, K. ∙ Shalev-Benami, M. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of a signaling cannabinoid receptor 1-G protein complex Cell. 2019; 176 :448-458.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GTP turnover assay was performed using a modified protocol of the GTPase-GloTM assay (Promega) as described previously ( Gregorio et al., 2017 29. Gregorio, G.G. ∙ Masureel, M. ∙ Hilger, D. ... Single-molecule analysis of ligand efficacy in beta2AR-G-protein activation Nature. 2017; 547 :68-73 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following modification. The final reaction buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 100 μM TCEP MNG/CHS (0.01%/0.001%), and 10 μM GTP. Before the reaction was started, CB1 (250 nM) was incubated in reaction buffer, at room temperature, in the presence of 20 μM agonist (CP 55,490), 20 μM inverse agonists (rimonabant or taranabant), or 100 μM genistein. Simultaneously, Gi1 protein 250 μM (in DDM) was incubated with 1 % MNG on ice. After 60 min, Gi1 was added to the reaction buffer to a final concentration of 250 nM together with CB1 to a final concentration of 125 nM. After incubation for 1 hr, reconstituted GTPase-Glo reagent supplemented with 10 mM ADP was added to the sample and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Luminescence was measured after the addition of detection reagent and incubation for 10 min at room temperature using a SpectraMax Paradigm plate reader. Percentage GTP turnover was calculated with receptor alone as 0 and CP 55490 as 100%. The curves were analyzed using GraphPad Prism.
Data shown were from at least three independent biological replicates. Quantitative data were presented as mean with standard error of the mean (SEM). The SPSS program (SPSS Inc.) or Prism was used for statistical analysis, including Student’s t-test, one-way ANOVA with multiple testing, and Tukey correction for multiple testing where appropriate. Statistical significance defined as p<0.05 ( ∗ or #), p<0.01 ( ∗∗ or ##), and p<0.001 ( ∗∗∗ or ###).
