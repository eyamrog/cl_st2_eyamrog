Title: A Quantitative Tissue-Specific Landscape of Protein Redox Regulation during Aging


Abstract: Summary

Mammalian tissues engage in specialized physiology that is regulated through reversible modification of protein cysteine residues by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS regulate a myriad of biological processes, but the protein targets of ROS modification that drive tissue-specific physiology in vivo are largely unknown. Here, we develop Oximouse, a comprehensive and quantitative mapping of the mouse cysteine redox proteome in vivo . We use Oximouse to establish several paradigms of physiological redox signaling. We define and validate cysteine redox networks within each tissue that are tissue selective and underlie tissue-specific biology. We describe a common mechanism for encoding cysteine redox sensitivity by electrostatic gating. Moreover, we comprehensively identify redox-modified disease networks that remodel in aged mice, establishing a systemic molecular basis for the long-standing proposed links between redox dysregulation and tissue aging. We provide the Oximouse compendium as a framework for understanding mechanisms of redox regulation in physiology and aging.

Section: Introduction

Mammalian tissues control distinct physiological processes despite all sharing substantially overlapping transcriptomes and proteomes. Much of this specialized physiology is initiated by post-translational protein modifications that can regulate target function depending on local circumstance. A major mode of post-translational regulation occurs through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and related species that modify protein function by covalent modification of cysteine residues ( Reczek and Chandel, 2015 56. Reczek, C.R. ∙ Chandel, N.S. ROS-dependent signal transduction Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 33 :8-13 Crossref Scopus (664) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because cysteine oxidation is fast and reversible, it is employed for modulation of protein function and localization ( Holmström and Finkel, 2014; Murphy et al., 2011 26. Holmström, K.M. ∙ Finkel, T. Cellular mechanisms and physiological consequences of redox-dependent signalling Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 :411-421 Crossref Scopus (1537) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Murphy, M.P. ∙ Holmgren, A. ∙ Larsson, N.G. ... Unraveling the biological roles of reactive oxygen species Cell Metab. 2011; 13 :361-366 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (644) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, redox modification of protein cysteines is implicated in a vast array of tissue-specific regulatory processes. Moreover, dysregulation of ROS and redox signaling is one of the longest postulated underlying causes of physiological decline of tissues with age ( Ristow, 2014; Schieber and Chandel, 2014 58. Ristow, M. Unraveling the truth about antioxidants: mitohormesis explains ROS-induced health benefits Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :709-711 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Schieber, M. ∙ Chandel, N.S. ROS function in redox signaling and oxidative stress Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :R453-R462 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4483) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Despite the widespread importance of redox regulation of tissue-specific physiology and mammalian aging, there is a persistent lack of information regarding the specific protein modifications that explain the molecular basis for these processes in vivo . Comprehensive analyses of this type are lacking because methods for studying protein redox regulation in vivo do not provide absolute stoichiometric quantitation and/or cover a very small proportion of the cysteine proteome ( Yang et al., 2016 74. Yang, J. ∙ Carroll, K.S. ∙ Liebler, D.C. The Expanding Landscape of the Thiol Redox Proteome Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2016; 15 :1-11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). For this reason, there has been no broad quantitative analysis of the redox proteome of living tissues. To address this unmet need, here, we develop a cysteine derivatization and enrichment method coupled with multiplexed proteomics to provide a quantitative and thorough characterization of tissue-specific protein cysteine oxidation in vivo . This Oximouse dataset quantifies the % reversible modification of ∼171,000 cysteine sites across ten mouse tissues in young and old mice, corresponding to ∼34,000 unique sites across ∼9,400 proteins. The oxidation state of over 98% of these sites have not previously been quantified in vivo in their corresponding tissue, so this landscape represents by far the deepest quantitative analysis of the redox-regulated cysteine proteome.
This compendium allows us to establish and validate distinct cysteine oxidation networks that underlie the unique physiologic and metabolic state of each tissue. From this dataset, we propose a general molecular basis for encoding redox sensitivity in protein cysteine thiols by local electrostatic gating. Unexpectedly, we also determine that aged tissues do not display an overall increase in protein oxidation. Instead, a fundamental remodeling of cysteine oxidation networks occurs in all aged tissues, and many of these networks map to established disease-relevant protein families. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive analysis of redox-signaling networks in living tissues, which can be accessed through an interactive web resource at https://oximouse.hms.harvard.edu .

Section: Results and Discussion

Broad and quantitative analysis of the cysteine proteome in living tissues has been a major technical challenge in the field of redox biology. Most methods for identification of redox modified proteins do not measure percent cysteine modification ( Yang et al., 2016 74. Yang, J. ∙ Carroll, K.S. ∙ Liebler, D.C. The Expanding Landscape of the Thiol Redox Proteome Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2016; 15 :1-11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quantification of the extent of reversible modification on a particular cysteine residue (i.e., site occupancy) is essential to identify functional nodes through which ROS and related species exert their physiological roles. Many cysteine residues are modified indiscriminately to a low extent ( Chouchani et al., 2017a; Go et al., 2011; Hansen et al., 2009; Leichert et al., 2008; Menger et al., 2015; Requejo et al., 2010 12.

Cysteine residues exposed on protein surfaces are the dominant intramitochondrial thiol and may protect against oxidative damage FEBS J. 2010; 277 :1465-1480 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, while transition from 0.01% to 0.5% modified is an apparent 50-fold change in modification state, such an alteration is unlikely to have major physiological consequences. Instead, we expect that only cysteine residues that are extensively modified can explain major regulatory actions of redox signaling. Although some proteomic approaches assess stoichiometry of cysteine modification, these methods achieve low proteome coverage (e.g., several hundred to ∼1,700 sites in mouse tissues) ( Chouchani et al., 2016, 2017a; Li et al., 2018 11.

Proteomic Analyses of Cysteine Redox in High-Fat-Fed and Fasted Mouse Livers: Implications for Liver Metabolic Homeostasis J. Proteome Res. 2018; 17 :129-140 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). These technical challenges have prevented broad quantitative interrogation of the role of protein redox modification in regulating tissue physiology in vivo .
To address this, we developed an approach to comprehensively identify and quantify the extent of reversible modification of tens of thousands of cysteines across the proteome in a single experiment. We considered the recent successes of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) methods for comprehensive analysis of phosphorylated proteins. IMAC facilitates ∼99% enrichment of phosphate-containing peptides ( Paulo et al., 2018 49. Paulo, J.A. ∙ Navarrete-Perea, J. ∙ Erickson, A.R. ... An Internal Standard for Assessing Phosphopeptide Recovery from Metal Ion/Oxide Enrichment Strategies J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2018; 29 :1505-1511 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), and phosphate-containing small molecules can functionalize peptides ( Huang et al., 2016 27. Huang, H. ∙ Haar Petersen, M. ∙ Ibañez-Vea, M. ... Simultaneous Enrichment of Cysteine-containing Peptides and Phosphopeptides Using a Cysteine-specific Phosphonate Adaptable Tag (CysPAT) in Combination with titanium dioxide (TiO2) Chromatography Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2016; 15 :3282-3296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). On this basis, we synthesized pilot CPTs containing: (1) a non-hydrolyzable phosphate moiety, (2) an iodoacetamide-based cysteine alkylating warhead, and (3) a linker to tune hydrophobicity and permit rapid CPT reagent purification ( Figures S1 A–S1D). We subjected denatured cell lysates to CPTs under reducing conditions to derivatize the entire cysteine proteome ( Figure S1 E). After proteolysis, endogenous phosphorylation was removed enzymatically, and CPT-derivatized cysteine-containing peptides were enriched by IMAC for mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis. Remarkably, this purification method allowed for identification of over 72,000 unique cysteine-containing peptides across the proteome using the 6C-CPT reagent, and over 99% enrichment selectivity for cysteine-containing peptides ( Figures S1 F–S1H; Table S1 ). CPT hydrophobicity was tuned by variable linker lengths that minimized loss of labeled cysteine peptides in the sample preparation process using 6C-CPT ( Figure S1 F). CPT-peptide purification is amenable to tandem mass tag (TMT)-multiplexing, so we applied it here to assess reproducibility of cysteine peptide labeling and quantification. We found that 6C-CPT (hereupon referred to as CPT) labeling efficiency and quantification was highly reproducible across replicate experiments ( Figure S1 I) and reported stoichiometry with high precision and accuracy ( Figures S1 J and S1K). Therefore, CPTs, IMAC, and TMT-MS provide a substantial improvement in coverage and reproducible quantification of cysteine-containing peptides ( Figures S1 G and S1K).
We next used CPTs as the basis to generate comprehensive and quantitative maps of cysteine oxidation state across the proteome. We developed a labeling strategy for proteome-wide quantification of thiols that are reversibly oxidized, combined with TMT multiplexing that allows for simultaneous analysis of five biological replicates in a single experiment ( Figures 1 A and S1 L; STAR Methods ). This labeling approach reports % reversible cysteine modification ( Figure S1 L), controls for changes in protein abundance, and allows for relative determination of protein abundance in the same experiment ( Gygi et al., 1999 22. Gygi, S.P. ∙ Rist, B. ∙ Gerber, S.A. ... Quantitative analysis of complex protein mixtures using isotope-coded affinity tags Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17 :994-999 Crossref Scopus (4416) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We first validated this approach using well-established manipulations of cysteine redox state in cells ( Mills et al., 2018 44. Mills, E.L. ∙ Pierce, K.A. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CPT method reported baseline cellular cysteine oxidation profiles that are in agreement with established methods used to determine bulk cellular thiol redox state ( Figure S1 M; Brandes et al., 2013; Go et al., 2011; Hansen et al., 2009 7. Brandes, N. ∙ Tienson, H. ∙ Lindemann, A. ... Time line of redox events in aging postmitotic cells eLife. 2013; 2 :e00306 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar 20. Go, Y.M. ∙ Duong, D.M. ∙ Peng, J. ... Protein Cysteines Map to Functional Networks According to Steady-state Level of Oxidation J. Proteomics Bioinform. 2011; 4 :196-209 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 23. Hansen, R.E. ∙ Roth, D. ∙ Winther, J.R. Quantifying the global cellular thiol-disulfide status Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :422-427 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local reduction potential is a major determinant of bulk subcellular thiol redox state ( Bak et al., 2019 4. Bak, D.W. ∙ Bechtel, T.J. ∙ Falco, J.A. ... Cysteine reactivity across the subcellular universe Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2019; 48 :96-105 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), and thiol oxidation distributions reported by CPT accurately reflected this ( Figure S1 N). Along similar lines, we mined the dataset for plasma-membrane spanning proteins containing both cytosolic and extracellular domains. Cysteine sites in extracellular domains were highly oxidized overall compared to cytosolic sites ( Figure S1 O). Chemical treatment of the lysed cysteine proteome with the thiol reducing agent TCEP fully abrogated the thiol oxidation profile proteome-wide, demonstrating that % modification values were attributable to reversible oxidation of cysteines ( Figure S1 P). Finally, we subjected intact cells to acute treatment with diamide, an established chemical tool for rapid oxidation of the intracellular thiol pools ( Hansen et al., 2009; Mills et al., 2018 23. Hansen, R.E. ∙ Roth, D. ∙ Winther, J.R. Quantifying the global cellular thiol-disulfide status Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :422-427 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar 44. Mills, E.L. ∙ Pierce, K.A. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). Acute diamide treatment caused a large shift in % oxidation of a substantial proportion of the cysteine proteome, as determined by CPT ( Figure S1 Q). Major shifts in cysteine oxidation occurred specifically on cytosolic and mitochondrial targets, including established sites on major thiol antioxidant proteins ( Figure S1 R). In contrast, extracellular sites that would not be expected to respond to diamide treatment were unaffected ( Figure S1 S). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the CPT approach accurately and precisely reports endogenous thiol redox state with deep proteome depth.
To determine comprehensive protein cysteine oxidation profiles in living tissues, ten organs were harvested from both 16-week-old and 80-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. Five biological replicates were harvested for each tissue at each age and subjected to the CPT workflow described above ( Figure 1 B). The final dataset, termed Oximouse, contained over 171,000 individual cysteine site quantifications across all tissues ( Table S1 ), matching ∼34,000 unique cysteine sites on ∼9,400 proteins. Importantly, nearly all of the cysteine sites mapped in our analyses have not been previously quantified in their corresponding tissue ( Figure S2 A). Two factors in particular contribute to the high proportion of previously unmapped sites. First, the majority of tissues studied here have never been examined for % cysteine modification state. Second, the CPT method provides over an order of magnitude improvement in cysteine-peptide enrichment compared to previous stoichiometric technologies ( Figure S1 G).
Global cysteine oxidation profiles were remarkably consistent across biological replicates in most tissues, with the large majority of cysteines exhibiting reproducible extents of modification in a given tissue ( Figures S2 B and S2C). The number of quantified cysteine sites per tissue varied, likely as a reflection of differences in proteome complexity and specialized signaling within each tissue ( Figure 1 C). We next leveraged the depth of the mapped cysteine redox proteome to generate quantitative population-level analyses of each tissue with subcellular resolution ( Figures 1 D–1F and S2 D; Table S2 ; STAR Methods ; Thul et al., 2017; UniProt Consortium, 2019 67. Thul, P.J. ∙ Åkesson, L. ∙ Wiking, M. ... A subcellular map of the human proteome Science. 2017; 356 :eaal3321 Crossref Scopus (1714) PubMed Google Scholar 70. UniProt Consortium UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D506-D515 Crossref Scopus (4870) PubMed Google Scholar ). The overall cellular and compartmentalized cysteine redox tone was similar across all tissues. The major exception to this was observed for secreted proteins ( Figure S2 D). These tissue-specific bulk differences in the cysteine modification state of secreted protein populations is likely explained, at least in part, by differences in tissue oxygenation, which would preferentially increase bulk oxidation state of extracellular thiols due to lack of intracellular thiol reducing machinery.
Next, we performed protein- and site- level analysis to define populations of redox-regulated proteins across mouse tissues. In all tissues, the large majority of cysteine residues were modified to a very small extent ( Figures S2 D and S2E). Conversely, between 20%–35% of proteins contained at least one cysteine residue that was highly (>20%) modified in at least one tissue, while fewer than 3% carried three or more highly modified sites ( Figure S2 E). All tissues had a sub-population of cysteines that were highly modified, and in the entire dataset, highly oxidized sites numbered in the tens of thousands ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Notably, the overall distribution of cysteine oxidation stoichiometry in every tissue was similar to established stoichiometric distribution of protein phosphorylation ( Lim et al., 2017 39. Lim, M.Y. ∙ O’Brien, J. ∙ Paulo, J.A. ... Improved Method for Determining Absolute Phosphorylation Stoichiometry Using Bayesian Statistics and Isobaric Labeling J. Proteome Res. 2017; 16 :4217-4226 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 G). In all tissues, there was no correlation between protein abundance and extent of cysteine modification ( Figure S2 H; Table S2 ). Instead, examination of predicted structural elements within proteins revealed that highly modified cysteine sites marked differences in structural classification ( Figure S2 I). As expected, in every tissue, cysteines with the established capacity to form disulfides exhibited much higher levels of oxidation than the overall population ( Figure S2 J). Together, these data suggest that cysteine redox sensitivity is encoded by proximal amino acid environment, the basis for which is investigated in a later section.
Despite similar bulk population characteristics of the redox proteome across tissues ( Figures 1 D–1F and S2 D–S2H), many highly modified sites in each tissue were uniquely modified in that particular tissue ( Figure S3 A; Table S2 ). Correlations modification state of individual cysteines between tissues were very weak ( Figure 1 G). Moreover, pairwise comparisons of individual tissues with similar overall redox tone consistently identified clusters of highly modified cysteine sites that were unique to each tissue, but on proteins expressed in both tissues ( Figures 1 H and S3 B). In fact, many of these tissue-specific modified sites were found on proteins expressed in all tissues ( Figure 1 I). We scored every Oximouse cysteine according to the variability of its oxidation state across tissues, as a measure of propensity for dynamic regulation, as opposed to consistent oxidation ( Table S2 ). Our examination of all highly redox modified proteins in the Oximouse dataset indicated that a majority exhibited a high level of dynamic, tissue-selective modification ( Figures S3 C and S3D). This analysis provides evidence that broadly expressed proteins are subject to redox regulation that is specifically tuned in each tissue, likely as a consequence of local upstream redox metabolism. In support of this model, we found that the expression levels of major ROS metabolizing enzymes and enzymes that control subcellular thiol redox state also exhibited a high degree of tissue-specific abundance ( Figures S4 A–S4E). Similarly, established protein sources of ROS are also divergently expressed across tissues ( Figures S4 F–S4I).
We identified numerous cases of tissue-specific regulation of established functional cysteines on ubiquitously expressed proteins. Reversible oxidative modification of Cys39 on the ND3 subunit of mitochondrial complex I is known to stabilize the “deactive” conformation of this target and inhibit enzymatic activity ( Chouchani et al., 2013; Galkin et al., 2008 10. Chouchani, E.T. ∙ Methner, C. ∙ Nadtochiy, S.M. ... Cardioprotection by S-nitrosation of a cysteine switch on mitochondrial complex I Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :753-759 Crossref Scopus (504) PubMed Google Scholar 19. Galkin, A. ∙ Meyer, B. ∙ Wittig, I. ... Identification of the mitochondrial ND3 subunit as a structural component involved in the active/deactive enzyme transition of respiratory complex I J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :20907-20913 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we find that different tissues can tune inhibition of complex I through modification of this site ( Figure 1 J). Along different lines, oxidative modification of Cys45 on pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2) inhibits its capacity to phosphorylate and inactivate the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex ( Hurd et al., 2012 28. Hurd, T.R. ∙ Collins, Y. ∙ Abakumova, I. ... Inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :35153-35160 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, this redox modification elevates mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism and TCA cycle supply. Here, we find that different tissues tune the activation of PDK2 through modification of Cys45 ( Figure 1 K). A third example is Cys147 on superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which forms a regulatory intramolecular disulfide that stabilizes the mature protein and limits pathogenic aggregation ( Álvarez-Zaldiernas et al., 2016 1. Álvarez-Zaldiernas, C. ∙ Lu, J. ∙ Zheng, Y. ... Cellular redox systems impact the aggregation of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :17197-17208 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, we found that Cys147 oxidation ranged from 25% in subQ fat to 100% in lung, demonstrating that this regulatory site is subject to widely divergent modification in different tissues ( Figure 1 L). These findings illustrate how the Oximouse landscape can define tissue specific redox regulatory nodes, both of established regulatory sites, as well as on the large majority of previously unmapped cysteines across the proteome.
The large majority of tissue-specific regulatory sites in Oximouse have not been described previously. Many tissue-specific cysteine oxidation sites coalesced to distinct biological processes in the respective tissue ( Figure S4 J). We reasoned that mapping cysteine oxidation data onto proteome networks can reveal tandem cysteine modifications that regulate proteins’ shared biological activities. The recently generated BioPlex 2.0 is the most comprehensive proteomic interactome generated to date ( Huttlin et al., 2017 32. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Bruckner, R.J. ∙ Paulo, J.A. ... Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks Nature. 2017; 545 :505-509 Crossref Scopus (950) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we combined Oximouse with Bioplex 2.0 to define redox-modified protein networks that underlie both tissue-specific and tissue-ubiquitous biology. Protein networks that exhibited coordinated redox regulation of cysteines (determined as >20% oxidized) were defined as “redox networks” in each tissue ( Figure 2 A). This approach allowed us to establish protein redox networks that are found in all tissues, as well as those that are tissue-selective ( Figure 2 B; Table S3 ; STAR Methods for details). Of the 1,320 protein networks established in BioPlex 2.0, several hundred exhibited coordinated redox regulation of cysteines in at least one tissue ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Almost all of these redox networks displayed some degree of tissue-selectivity ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Table S3 ). Of the 2,293 unique proteins present in redox networks, 113 contained protein cysteines that have been previously reported as sensitive to oxidative modification in diverse biological models, including yeast ( Topf et al., 2018 69. Topf, U. ∙ Suppanz, I. ∙ Samluk, L. ... Quantitative proteomics identifies redox switches for global translation modulation by mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :324 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ), flies ( Menger et al., 2015 43. Menger, K.E. ∙ James, A.M. ∙ Cochemé, H.M. ... Fasting, but Not Aging, Dramatically Alters the Redox Status of Cysteine Residues on Proteins in Drosophila melanogaster Cell Rep. 2015; 11 :1856-1865 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), and in cellular studies ( van der Reest et al., 2018 71. van der Reest, J. ∙ Lilla, S. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Proteome-wide analysis of cysteine oxidation reveals metabolic sensitivity to redox stress Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1581 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 C; Table S3 ).
Coordinated redox modification was observed for a wide range of protein networks with diverse biological activities, the large majority of which were not previously known to be subject to redox regulation ( Table S3 ). This suggests that the Oximouse redox networks are a rich resource for establishing previously unappreciated mechanisms of redox regulation in different tissues. Redox networks identified across many different tissues most often were associated with ubiquitous biological processes. For example, we discovered ubiquitous coordinated redox modification of a network of proteins that control tRNA aminoacylation ( Figures 2 D and 2E). In contrast, the majority of redox networks displayed some degree of tissue selectivity and were often associated with regulatory protein networks and metabolic pathways ( Table S3 ). For example, we found that coordinated modification of protein networks that regulate catabolism of glycogen ( Figure 2 F) and glucose ( Figure 3 A) were enriched in tissues for which rapid glycogen and glucose utilization is important.
We next selected newly identified redox networks to investigate the role of redox regulation on corresponding biological function. One exemplar network controls glucose phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) through hexokinases (HKs), which supplies glycolytic metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP; Figure 3 A; Table S3 ). Flux through HKs is tightly controlled in numerous tissues where this redox network was identified, so we hypothesized that oxidation of HK cysteines could be a node of redox regulation of G6P production. We examined C2C12 myoblasts, which exhibited substantial oxidation of the same major redox-regulated sites identified on HK2 from the Oximouse dataset ( Figure 3 B). We determined the effects of inhibition of cellular thiol oxidation using N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on glucose flux through HKs ( Figure 3 C). NAC is a cell-permeable cysteine precursor established to reduce the oxidation of redox modified protein thiols ( Atkuri et al., 2007 2. Atkuri, K.R. ∙ Mantovani, J.J. ∙ Herzenberg, L.A. ... N-Acetylcysteine--a safe antidote for cysteine/glutathione deficiency Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2007; 7 :355-359 Crossref Scopus (567) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reducing cellular thiol oxidation with NAC had no effect on glucose uptake, but significantly potentiated flux of glucose to G6P ( Figure 3 D). Elevated flux from glucose to G6P was sufficient to drive supply to the PPP preferentially over distal glycolytic reactions ( Figure 3 D). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of HK2 ( Figure 3 E) largely abrogated NAC-dependent flux of glucose to G6P ( Figure 3 F), indicating the dependence on HK2 for the effects of NAC on G6P flux. Using diamide to increase cellular protein thiol oxidation ( Hansen et al., 2009 23. Hansen, R.E. ∙ Roth, D. ∙ Winther, J.R. Quantifying the global cellular thiol-disulfide status Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :422-427 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed the opposite effect of NAC (i.e., substantial inhibition of flux from glucose to G6P) ( Figure 3 G). These effects of diamide were attributable to substantial oxidation of three cysteines on HK2, with only Cys909 exhibiting >10% increase in oxidation ( Figure 3 H). To further explore the functional importance of HK2 cysteine modification on function, we made use of the well-established HK2 covalent inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) ( Ko et al., 2001 34. Ko, Y.H. ∙ Pedersen, P.L. ∙ Geschwind, J.F. Glucose catabolism in the rabbit VX2 tumor model for liver cancer: characterization and targeting hexokinase Cancer Lett. 2001; 173 :83-91 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). 3BP inhibits HK2 via covalent cysteine modification ( Chen et al., 2009 8. Chen, Z. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Lu, W. ... Role of mitochondria-associated hexokinase II in cancer cell death induced by 3-bromopyruvate Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787 :553-560 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ), but its site(s) of action are unknown. Here, we used CPT to determine whether redox sensitive HK2 cysteines ( Figure 3 B) were adducted by 3BP. Remarkably, we found that 3BP irreversibly modifies both Cys823 and Cys909 ( Figure 3 I). Finally, we found that the stimulatory effects of HK2 activity by thiol reduction were completely lost when these HK2 cysteines were irreversibly modified by 3BP ( Figure 3 J). Therefore, our data show that thiol oxidation of HK2 is a newfound inhibitory redox control point for conversion of cellular glucose to G6P ( Figure 3 K).
The most tissue-ubiquitous redox network we identified was a tRNA multi-synthetase complex containing numerous tRNA synthetases and accessory proteins ( Figure 3 L). Assembly of tRNA multi-synthetase complexes are thought to regulate protein translation efficiency through tRNA channeling ( Lee et al., 2004 36. Lee, S.W. ∙ Cho, B.H. ∙ Park, S.G. ... Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes: beyond translation J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117 :3725-3734 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ) and have been implicated in a wide range of regulatory processes ( Hyeon et al., 2019; Ray et al., 2007 33. Hyeon, D.Y. ∙ Kim, J.H. ∙ Ahn, T.J. ... Evolution of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex and its role in cancer J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :5340-5351 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Ray, P.S. ∙ Arif, A. ∙ Fox, P.L. Macromolecular complexes as depots for releasable regulatory proteins Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32 :158-164 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our redox network analysis, we hypothesized that assembly of some components of the tRNA multi-synthase complex are regulated by cysteine oxidation ( Figure 3 M). We purified the tRNA multi-synthase complex by immunoprecipitation of core components. In this context, manipulation of reversible cysteine thiol modifications with dithiothreitol (DTT) selectively modulated incorporation of two aminoacylation complex subunits: methionine and leucine tRNA synthetases (MARS and LARS, respectively) ( Figure 3 N). Notably, among the complex components, MARS plays a particular role in coordinating translation initiation ( Kwon et al., 2004 35. Kwon, J. ∙ Lee, S.R. ∙ Yang, K.S. ... Reversible oxidation and inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN in cells stimulated with peptide growth factors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :16419-16424 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that this process in particular is subject to regulation by cysteine oxidation ( Figure 3 O). Together, these findings illustrate how the Oximouse compendium can be leveraged to explore new mechanisms of redox regulation in tissues.
The Oximouse dataset determined that highly modified cysteine sites are rare, and selectively modified ( Figures 1 I and S2 E). This suggests that redox-regulated cysteines exist in local environments that tune the target thiol sidechain for oxidative modification. Remarkably, across all mouse tissues, a common amino acid signature was enriched surrounding (± 4 positions) highly modified cysteine residues (>20% modified; Figure 4 A). The two consistent features of this molecular signature were: (1) selection against acidic amino acids (aspartic acid and glutamic acid), and (2) selection for the basic amino acid arginine ( Figure 4 A). The motif that emerged from these analyses selected for these signature features across several local positions spanning the cysteine residue ( Figures 4 B and S4 K), suggestive of cis -acting regulation of cysteines that persists across a range of possible positions. We propose that this spanning signature can be explained by the chemical effects of proximal charge on cysteine thiol side chains. At physiological pH, protein cysteines exist in equilibrium between the thiol and thiolate form ( Figure 4 C). It is well known that negatively charged thiolates are much more sensitive to redox modification than the corresponding thiol ( Paulsen and Carroll, 2013; Poole, 2015 50. Paulsen, C.E. ∙ Carroll, K.S. Cysteine-mediated redox signaling: chemistry, biology, and tools for discovery Chem. Rev. 2013; 113 :4633-4679 Crossref Scopus (906) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Poole, L.B. The basics of thiols and cysteines in redox biology and chemistry Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 80 :148-157 Crossref Scopus (678) PubMed Google Scholar ). The thiolate/thiol equilibrium is sensitive to electrostatic modulation, and the positively charged side group of arginine would stabilize the negatively charged thiolate form of a proximal cysteine side chain ( Figure 4 C). In contrast, negatively charged side chains of aspartic acid and glutamic acid would favor the protonated cysteine thiol ( Figure 4 C). The motifs described here provide a chemical rationale for encoding redox sensitivity into a target cysteine by tuning the thiolate/thiol ratio via local electrostatic effects.
A direct prediction of the above model is that conserved structural domains should also confer redox sensitivity to cysteine residues that depends on proximal charged amino acids. We first examined the mitochondrial transporter family, which share a highly conserved pseudo-3-fold symmetric helix-loop-helix regulatory domain ( Figure 4 D; Robinson et al., 2008 59. Robinson, A.J. ∙ Overy, C. ∙ Kunji, E.R. The mechanism of transport by mitochondrial carriers based on analysis of symmetry Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :17766-17771 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). This domain contains a highly conserved cysteine residue we mapped in several mitochondrial transporters ( Figures 4 D and 4E). These sites consistently coincided with an interacting arginine residue and exhibited a much higher propensity to be highly modified compared to the overall cysteine population. Many of these cysteines have established roles in modulating target function. For example, oxidative modification of these redox sensitive sites on AAC1 and AAC2 inhibits ATP/ADP translocase activity and potentiates proton leak activity ( Bertholet et al., 2019; McStay et al., 2002 6. Bertholet, A.M. ∙ Chouchani, E.T. ∙ Kazak, L. ... H + transport is an integral function of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier Nature. 2019; 571 :515-520 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar 42. McStay, G.P. ∙ Clarke, S.J. ∙ Halestrap, A.P. Role of critical thiol groups on the matrix surface of the adenine nucleotide translocase in the mechanism of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore Biochem. J. 2002; 367 :541-548 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 F). Similarly, modification of Cys253 on UCP1 is known to potentiate thermogenic leak activity through this protein ( Chouchani et al., 2016 11. Chouchani, E.T. ∙ Kazak, L. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Mitochondrial ROS regulate thermogenic energy expenditure and sulfenylation of UCP1 Nature. 2016; 532 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next examined the redox sensitive Cys909 on HK2, characterized in this study ( Figures 3 A–3J). This functional residue is also coordinated by a local arginine side chain, and is accessible to solvent, coinciding with its high degree of redox and electrophilic sensitivity ( Figure 4 G). Finally, we examined Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase family members, and found several instances of highly oxidized cysteines that are coordinated by proximal arginine residues. A prominent example is Cys185 on the SH2 domain of the Src kinase, which is highly redox sensitive and coordinated by two proximal arginine side chains ( Figure 4 H). This site, in particular, has been shown to control Src kinase activation, and oxidation is mutually antagonistic with proximal phosphorylation ( Figure 4 H; Heppner et al., 2018 25. Heppner, D.E. ∙ Dustin, C.M. ∙ Liao, C. ... Direct cysteine sulfenylation drives activation of the Src kinase Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4522 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these findings provide a general model for tuning of cysteine thiol redox sensitivity on the basis of cis -acting electrostatic interactions with charged amino acids.
Because the degree of cysteine redox modification is consistently dependent on local electrostatic environment, we predicted that the negative charge of the phosphorylated side chain would antagonize cysteine oxidation by favoring protonation of local thiols ( Figure 4 I). To examine this, we established the general quantitative relationship between cysteine modification state and proximal phosphorylation state across mouse tissues by combining our dataset with a compendium of tissue-specific protein phosphorylation (∼36,000 phosphosites total) ( Huttlin et al., 2010 30. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ∙ Elias, J.E. ... A tissue-specific atlas of mouse protein phosphorylation and expression Cell. 2010; 143 :1174-1189 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found in every tissue that negative correlations exist between % modification of cysteine residues and the propensity for phosphorylation proximal to that site ( Figures 4 J–4M).
The importance of ROS dysregulation in age-dependent disease and tissue dysfunction has been appreciated for nearly three quarters of a century ( Harman, 1956 24. Harman, D. Aging: a theory based on free radical and radiation chemistry J. Gerontol. 1956; 11 :298-300 Crossref Scopus (6907) PubMed Google Scholar ). This link has largely been considered through the lens of irreversible macromolecular damage by ROS during aging ( López-Otín et al., 2013 40. López-Otín, C. ∙ Blasco, M.A. ∙ Partridge, L. ... The hallmarks of aging Cell. 2013; 153 :1194-1217 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9723) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the evidence for this model is inconsistent and imprecise ( Murphy et al., 2011; Ristow, 2014 45. Murphy, M.P. ∙ Holmgren, A. ∙ Larsson, N.G. ... Unraveling the biological roles of reactive oxygen species Cell Metab. 2011; 13 :361-366 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (644) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Ristow, M. Unraveling the truth about antioxidants: mitohormesis explains ROS-induced health benefits Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :709-711 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the mechanistic details of ROS signaling in mammalian aging are lacking, we explored the effects of age on tissue cysteine oxidation networks in mice.
The redox proteomes of 80-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were determined as described in Figure 1 B ( Table S2 ). Similar to young tissues, bulk cysteine oxidation profiles were consistent across biological replicates, with the large majority of cysteines exhibiting reproducible extents of modification in a given tissue ( Figures S5 A–S5C; Table S2 ). Unexpectedly, the overall cysteine cellular and compartmentalized redox tone of all tissues was extremely similar when comparing old and young mice ( Figures 5 A–5F and S5 D). In fact, in the case of secreted proteins, bulk decrease in oxidation was observed in most tissues ( Figure 5 D). This could reflect compromised tissue oxygenation or decreased secretion of proteins with age, both of which would be predicted to affect bulk oxidation in this compartment specifically. In parallel, we examined markers of irreversible protein oxidation in young and old tissues. In all tissues, no differences were observed in bulk protein carbonylation or in lipid-peroxide-derived oxidative adducts with age ( Figures S5 E and S5F). The levels of intermediates that drive irreversible macromolecular oxidation did not increase with age in any tissue ( Figures S5 G and S5H). Moreover, in all aged tissues, no consistent depletion was observed of central proteins involved in ROS metabolism and maintenance of protein thiol and glutathione bulk redox state ( Figures S5 I–S5N). Taken together, the Oximouse landscape provides strong evidence against bulk increases in macromolecular oxidation with age. This finding is consistent with a previous study demonstrating a lack of bulk protein thiol oxidation increase in aging D. melanogaster ( Menger et al., 2015 43. Menger, K.E. ∙ James, A.M. ∙ Cochemé, H.M. ... Fasting, but Not Aging, Dramatically Alters the Redox Status of Cysteine Residues on Proteins in Drosophila melanogaster Cell Rep. 2015; 11 :1856-1865 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next performed protein- and site-level analysis to define individual redox-regulated proteins that change with age. Despite consistent bulk population characteristics of the redox proteome during aging ( Figures 5 A–5F, S5 D, and S6 A), analysis of individual cysteines revealed redox proteomic signatures within aged tissues that were largely distinct from the corresponding young tissue. Most strikingly, many of the highly modified sites identified in young tissues were lost in aged tissues ( Figures 5 G, 5H, and S6 B). The loss of tissue-specific redox-regulated sites found in young tissues coincided with emergence of different sites that were specific to aged tissues ( Figures 5 G–5K and S6 B). Interestingly, these age-specific signatures were also tissue-specific ( Figures 5 I–5K). Moreover, we tracked protein abundance in parallel with cysteine oxidation ( Table S2 ) and found in all tissues that no systematic relationship existed between changes in protein oxidation and abundance with age ( Figure S6 C). Together, these data illustrate an unexpected and fundamental remodeling of the redox signaling landscape with age. In contrast to the prevailing view that non-specific protein oxidation increases with age, we find that redox-regulated sites that confer tissue-specific regulation are lost with age. Moreover, aged tissues exhibit distinct age- and tissue-specific redox-regulated clusters reflecting a fundamentally reprogramed redox signaling landscape.
Dysregulation of ROS is associated with many age-related diseases, yet the molecular basis for these links is almost entirely lacking. Here, we systematically determined concerted regulatory processes governed by cysteine oxidation that are altered with age ( Figure 6 A). We identified dozens of redox networks that were specific to aged tissues and exhibited coordinated redox regulation of cysteines in at least one tissue ( Figures 6 B and 6C; Table S4 ). Of these “age-specific” redox networks, the majority exhibited substantial tissue-selectivity ( Figure 6 B; Table S4 ). Additionally, we found that hundreds of the redox networks identified in young mice were lost in aged tissues ( Figure 6 C). We hypothesized that protein targets of age-dependent redox-regulation could underlie ROS-dependent diseases of aging. To explore this, we mapped age-dependent redox networks onto DisGeNET, a comprehensive collection of established disease-linked proteins ( Figures 6 D and S7 A; Table S5 ; Piñero et al., 2015 53. Piñero, J. ∙ Queralt-Rosinach, N. ∙ Bravo, À. ... DisGeNET: a discovery platform for the dynamical exploration of human diseases and their genes Database (Oxford). 2015; 2015 :bav028 Crossref Scopus (748) PubMed Google Scholar ). In most tissues, we identified highly significant mapping of age-dependent redox-regulated sites onto established disease protein networks ( Figures 6 D–6G and S7 B–S7F; Table S5 ). We considered redox-regulated disease processes that were selectively modified in aged tissues to be “redox maladaptive,” because increased redox modification coincided with age and disease annotation ( Figures 6 E, 6F, S7 B, and S7E). Conversely, we classified networks exhibiting loss of redox modification coinciding with age and disease annotation as “redox adaptive” ( Figures 6 G, S7 C, S7D, and S7F).
For instance, prominent examples of redox maladaptive disease processes were identified in skeletal muscle (SKM) and heart ( Figures 6 E and 6F). Coordinated redox regulation of proteins drivers of muscular dystrophies was a robust signature of aged SKM ( Figure 6 E). Conversely, in the aged heart, we identified significant redox modification of disease proteins for which altered regulation is known to drive mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathies ( Figure 6 F; Table S5 ). We also found numerous examples of tissue-specific redox-adaptive networks. For example, protein networks involved in weight gain were selectively redox-modified in young BAT, and lost in old BAT ( Figure 6 G). The thermogenic function of BAT is known to rely critically on ROS regulation and to diminish with age ( Chouchani et al., 2017b 13. Chouchani, E.T. ∙ Kazak, L. ∙ Spiegelman, B.M. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and adipose tissue thermogenesis: Bridging physiology and mechanisms J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :16810-16816 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because BAT-dependent thermogenesis plays a significant role in whole body energy balance, our data suggest that these redox targets, in particular, could play a role in age-dependent obesity.
Together, these data provide a systemic molecular basis for understanding the role of ROS dysregulation with age. Redox-regulated sites and networks found in young tissues are fundamentally remodeled in aged tissues. As opposed to the pervasive view that ROS-driven protein modification indiscriminately increases with age, the Oximouse landscape demonstrates that distinct redox signaling networks are instead selectively altered in every tissue. Because many of these networks map to established disease-relevant proteins in corresponding tissues, this dataset provides a disease- and tissue-specific map to understand mechanisms of ROS action in age-related tissue dysfunction.
Oximouse represents a comprehensive redox regulation atlas, reporting redox signatures and networks for thousands of proteins in healthy tissues and during aging. Importantly, this method reports deep cysteine proteome depth and quantitative accuracy, both of which are critical pre-requisites for understanding redox signaling at a systems level. We provide this dataset via an intuitive online interface, which we expect will provide a basis for future targeted research to better understand the biological role of redox regulation of proteins ( https://oximouse.hms.harvard.edu ).
Oximouse illuminates several general principles of redox signaling in physiology. We propose that a central mode of encoding redox sensitivity of the cysteine side chain is via local electrostatic modulation of the thiolate/thiol equilibrium. The cysteine thiolate is much more sensitive to oxidation than the corresponding thiol, but thiolate stabilization per se is insufficient to drive modification. The other critical variable is thiolate proximity to the modifying species. This is likely to be a significant layer of regulation that confers the tissue- and age-specificity observed in the Oximouse dataset. For example, it is known that ROS levels are controlled by several different proteins in the cell, including mitochondrial enzymes, NADPH oxidases, ROS metabolizing enzymes, and protein thiol reduction pathways. Distinct bioenergetic and spatial parameters control ROS levels through these proteins, which are presumably divergent across tissues and age. In this way, tissue-specific differences in sites of ROS production and thiol reduction may dictate whether a cysteine that is electrostatically tuned for modification becomes modified. Along similar lines, differential protein localization, or local phosphorylation, could confer tissue- and age-specific cysteine modification based on altered proximity and electrostatic potential, respectively.
Redox regulation of cysteines can result from a number of types of reversible modification, including sulfenylation, disulfide formation, S-nitrosation, and others ( Chouchani et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2016 9. Chouchani, E.T. ∙ James, A.M. ∙ Fearnley, I.M. ... Proteomic approaches to the characterization of protein thiol modification Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2011; 15 :120-128 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar 74. Yang, J. ∙ Carroll, K.S. ∙ Liebler, D.C. The Expanding Landscape of the Thiol Redox Proteome Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2016; 15 :1-11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). We designed the Oximouse approach to report the aggregate modification state of all of these reversible modification types, so that the landscape would be representative of the overall redox status of cysteines across the proteome. Importantly, chemical methods exist for selective labeling of particular types of reversible cysteine modification, and the Oximouse method is in principle amenable to these approaches as well. We predict that similar CPT enrichment reagents based on sulfenic acid-targeting chemistry ( Gupta et al., 2016 21. Gupta, V. ∙ Paritala, H. ∙ Carroll, K.S. Reactivity, Selectivity, and Stability in Sulfenic Acid Detection: A Comparative Study of Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Probes Bioconjug. Chem. 2016; 27 :1411-1418 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) or S-nitrosothiols ( Chouchani et al., 2017a 12. Chouchani, E.T. ∙ James, A.M. ∙ Methner, C. ... Identification and quantification of protein S -nitrosation by nitrite in the mouse heart during ischemia J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :14486-14495 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) will allow for comprehensive quantitative analyses of particular types of cysteine modification in the near future.
Oximouse is a quantitative redox signaling landscape of protein cysteine residues in vivo , which defines numerous tissue-selective redox-regulated proteins and networks involved in both healthy physiology and in aging. Together, this work provides the foundation for understanding mechanistic targets of redox signaling in vivo and will encourage future efforts to expand our understanding of how redox regulation controls physiology and disease.

Healthy male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories and housed in a temperature-controlled (20–22 °C) room on a 6am to 6pm light/dark cycle. All animal-related experiments were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Interscapular brown adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction was extracted from 2 to 4-day-old pups as described previously ( Mills et al., 2018 44. Mills, E.L. ∙ Pierce, K.A. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extracted tissue was washed in PBS, minced, and treated with 1.5 mg ml −1 collagenase B in PBS containing 100 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 123 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl 2 , and 4% fatty-acid-free BSA for 45 min at 37 °C on a water bath rocking platform. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min to pellet the stromal vascular fraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in adipocyte culture medium (DMEM/F12 + Glutamax with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin and streptomycin), spun again, filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer, and plated. Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator with 10% CO 2 at 37°C. Remaining cell debris were removed the next day, and media was changed daily until cells were confluent. Brown pre-adipocytes were then differentiated using adipocyte culture medium with the addition of 1 μM rosiglitazone, 0.5 mM IBMX, 5 μM dexamethasone, 0.114 μg ml − 1 insulin, 1 nM T3, and 125 μM Indomethacin. Two days after induction, media was changed to adipocyte culture medium containing 1 μM rosiglitazone, 1nM T3, and 0.5 μg/ml insulin, and media was refreshed every 48 hours until brown adipocytes are fully differentiated.
C2C12 mouse muscle cells, HEK293T cells, and HCT 116 cells (all from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mix. All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 at 37°C.
Succinimydyl iodoacetate (SIA) was purchased from Combi-Blocks. 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid (2-AEP) and 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid (3-APP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and 6-aminohexylphosphonic acid hydrochloride salt (6-AHP) was purchased from SiKÉMIA. Synthesis was initiated by adding 6-AHP to SIA to final concentrations of 45 mM SIA and 175 mM 6-AHP, and allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with gentle shaking. Reaction was quenched by addition of TFA to a final pH < 2, and purified on a Waters HPLC system (C18 column, solvent A: water with 0.035% TFA, solvent B: acetonitrile (ACN) with 0.035% TFA, 100%–40% solvent A over a 60-min gradient at a flow rate of 40 mL/min). The elution containing cysteine-reactive phosphate tag with the 6-carbon linker (6C-CPT) was frozen in a dry ice-acetone mixture for 30 min and lyophilized. Quality of synthesis was monitored by subjecting purified CPT to a 10-min run on Luna-HILIC column (Phenomenex) using an UltiMate-3000 TPLRS LC coupled with Q-Exactive™ HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo). Syntheses of 2C-CPT and 3C-CPT followed the same route.
C2C12 cells were harvested by gentle scraping in PBS and suspended in an ice-cold buffer containing 100 mM HEPES, pH = 8.5, 8M urea, 2% SDS, and 1 pellet/15 mL protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The resulting lysate mixture was passed 10 times through a 21-gauge needle and cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay, and split into 150 μg protein aliquots as the starting material for each individual optimization experiment. Reversible cysteine modifications were removed by 30 min incubation with 5 mM TCEP at 56°C, followed by 15 min at room temperature. CPTs were added individually at 10 mM, incubated at 37°C for 2 h on a shaking incubator in the dark. Proteins were then precipitated using methanol and chloroform ( Wessel and Flügge, 1984 72. Wessel, D. ∙ Flügge, U.I. A method for the quantitative recovery of protein in dilute solution in the presence of detergents and lipids Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138 :141-143 Crossref Scopus (3384) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the resulting pellet was washed twice with ice-cold methanol. Proteins were resuspended in 10 mM HEPES pH = 8.5, 1.6 M urea, 1% ACN, and digested overnight at 37°C with LysC (Wako) and trypsin (Promega) at enzyme: substrate = 1:100, followed by another 6 h trypsin digestion the next day. Digestion was quenched by the addition of 10% TFA to a final concentration of 0.4%, and supernatant was desalted using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and lyophilized overnight. The resulting peptides were then subjected to Lambda phosphatase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) treatment following the manufacturer’s protocol to remove phosphate groups from endogenously phosphorylated peptides, and desalted and lyophilized once more. High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo) was used to purify CPT-labeled peptides following the manufacturer’s instructions. To assess completeness of CPT-labeling post TCEP reduction, C2C12 cell lysate aliquots described above were labeled by 6C-CPT at concentrations of 0, 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM for 2 h at 25°C or 37°C in the dark. CPT-labeled proteins were then chased by labeling with 50 mM IAM, quenched with dithiothreitol (DTT), precipitated, and digested. The resulting peptides were prepared as described above. CPT-labeled peptides, IAM-labeled peptides, phosphorylated peptides, and non-labeled peptides were analyzed to evaluate labeling and enrichment efficiency of the CPT-IMAC workflow.
HEK293T and HCT 116 cells were separately cultured, harvested, and lysed following the same protocol described in the last section. Total protein concentration was adjusted to 1.5 μg/μl, and after reduction with TCEP, proteins were labeled with 10 mM 6C-CPT for 2 h at 37°C in the dark and 6C-CPT was removed by methanol-chloroform precipitation. After tryptic digestion, peptides were desalted through Sep-Pak cartridges and lyophilized. Peptides were then dephosphorylated, enriched, purified, and the resulting CPT-labeled peptides were subjected to tandem mass tags (TMT)-labeling following the manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, peptides were resuspended in 200 mM N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(3-propanesulfonic acid) (EPPS) buffer pH = 8, and quantified by a microBCA assay. Equal amounts of peptides were labeled by 10-plex TMT reagents (Thermo) in 30% ACN/EPPS solution for an hour at room temperature, the first five TMT channels were used to label five HEK293T replicates, the other five labeled HCT 116 replicates. The reaction was quenched using 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min and acidified using 20% formic acid (FA). Samples were then mixed, desalted using a Sep-Pak column, and lyophilized. Following this, samples were fractionated by an Agilent 1100 quaternary pump with a degasser and a photodiode array using a 57 min linear gradient from 3% to 32% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH = 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min −1 . Peptides were separated into a total of 96 fractions, acidified by addition of 20% FA, and consolidated into 24 tubes. After overnight lyophilization, these 24 fractions were reconstituted in a solution containing 5% FA and 5% ACN, and analyzed by LC-MS.
Proteins from C2C12 cells were labeled by 6C-CPT, digested, and desalted following the procedures described above. The resulting peptides were enriched by IMAC, purified, aliquoted to dilution ratios to generate artificial stoichiometries of 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75%. The samples were then labeled by 10-plex TMT reagents. All groups were then mixed, desalted, and separated by high-pH HPLC as described above and combined into 12 fractions. After complete lyophilization, the CPT- and TMT-labeled peptides were purified by stage-tips and analyzed by LC-MS.
Brown adipocytes were treated with either vehicle or 350 μM diamide for 30 minutes. Cells were then lysed in ice-cold 20% TCA, and washed with 20% TCA, 10% TCA, and 5% TCA twice. Samples were then differentially labeled and % oxidation on cysteine residues was quantified as described in the determining % oxidation of cysteine residues section below. Cysteine % oxidation in C2C12 myoblasts were examined using the same strategy.
Duplex short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from OriGene and knockdowns were performed in a 12-well format. For each well, two Eppendorf tubes were prepared. 50 μL Optimem was added to each tube. 3 μL of RNAimax (Lipofectamine) was added to one tube and siRNA was added to the other tube. The tube containing the siRNA was added to the tube with RNAimax drop by drop with shaking and incubated for 10 min. The mix was evenly distributed to the bottom surface of a well drop by drop, then C2C12 cells were plated on top of the siRNA mixture at 25% confluency. The final siRNA concentration used was 20 nM. Media was changed to DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin 24 h later. Experiments were performed 48 h post transfection.
Tracing media was prepared from phenol red-, glucose-, glutamine-, sodium pyruvate-, sodium bicarbonate-free DMEM powder (Sigma) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM D-glucose- 13 C 6 , 4 mM L-glutamine. C2C12 cells were plated in 12-well plates and cultured with regular DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as described above. To manipulate cysteine redox status, media was changed to tracing media with or without 10 mM NAC for three durations (2 min, 15 min, and 30 min), or with or without 500 μM diamide for 15 min. For HK2 inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated with or without 500 μM 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) for 30 min, then the media was changed to tracing media with or without 3BP and/or 10 mM NAC for 15 min. For HK2 knockdown experiments, cells were treated in tracing media with or without 10 mM NAC for 15 min. Metabolites were extracted from each well by scraping cells on ice with 125 μL cold 80% methanol containing three internal standards: 0.05 ng/ μL thymine-d 4 , 0.05 ng/ μL inosine- 15 N 4 , and 0.1 ng/ μL glycocholate-d 4 .
Stoichiometry of irreversible 3BP modification of HK2 cysteines was determined using a competition labeling approach described previously ( Backus et al., 2016 3. Backus, K.M. ∙ Correia, B.E. ∙ Lum, K.M. ... Proteome-wide covalent ligand discovery in native biological systems Nature. 2016; 534 :570-574 Crossref Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ). C2C12 cells were grown in 12-well plates until confluent, and treated with either 500 μM 3BP or vehicle control for 15 minutes. Media was removed, and cells in each well were harvested in 150 μL of labeling buffer containing 100 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 8 M urea, 2% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTPA, 10 μM neocuproine, and 35 mM CPT. Labeling was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h with vigorous shaking in the dark. Proteins were then precipitated, resuspended in 200 mM EPPS pH = 8.5, then and peptides were prepared as described above. Percent TMT signal loss of HK2 cysteine peptides from control to treated cells was used to determine 3BP modification stoichiometry.
Stable cell lines expressing C-terminally FLAG-HA-tagged RARS, QARS, and GFP were created according to protocols described previously ( Huttlin et al., 2015 31. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Ting, L. ∙ Bruckner, R.J. ... The BioPlex Network: A Systematic Exploration of the Human Interactome Cell. 2015; 162 :425-440 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (986) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, expression clones were validated, and introduced to HEK293T cells via lentivirus transduction. Cells were expanded in 15-cm dishes under puromycin selection, and harvested near 100% confluence. Two experiments were performed using either RARS or QARS expressing cells. In each experiment, five dishes of cells were lysed with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) NP-40 as the control group; another five dishes were lysed with the same buffer with the addition of 50 mM DTT as the experimental group. One dish of GFP-expressing cells was used as a negative control. Cell lysis was followed by centrifugation and filtration to clear the lysates and remove debris. Affinity purification was performed by incubating the clarified lysate with immobilized and pre-washed mouse monoclonal anti-HA agarose resin (Sigma-Aldrich, clone HA-7) for 2 h at 4°C on an end-over-end rotor. Beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer followed by two washes with lysis buffer without NP-40. Proteins were eluted using 250ug/mL HA peptide in PBS at 37°C for 30 min twice and subsequently precipitated using TCA overnight. Protein pellets were then washed, and digested by LysC and trypsin in 200 mM EPPS. Resulting peptides from five control replicates, five experimental replicates, and one GFP negative control were labeled by 11-plex TMT reagents following the SL-TMT protocol ( Navarrete-Perea et al., 2018 46. Navarrete-Perea, J. ∙ Yu, Q. ∙ Gygi, S.P. ... Streamlined Tandem Mass Tag (SL-TMT) Protocol: An Efficient Strategy for Quantitative (Phospho)proteome Profiling Using Tandem Mass Tag-Synchronous Precursor Selection-MS3 J. Proteome Res. 2018; 17 :2226-2236 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Labeled peptides were then mixed and desalted using stage tips.
In order to preserve in vivo cysteine oxidation status, mice were euthanized by rapid cervical dislocation, and all tissues were extracted in less than thirty seconds following euthanasia. Wollenberger tongs were prechilled in liquid nitrogen and used to freeze-clamp each tissue immediately upon extraction ( Wollenberger et al., 1960 73. Wollenberger, A. ∙ Ristau, O. ∙ Schoffa, G. [A simple technic for extremely rapid freezing of large pieces of tissue] Pflugers Arch. Gesamte Physiol. Menschen Tiere. 1960; 270 :399-412 Crossref Scopus (736) PubMed Google Scholar ). To minimize time between euthanasia and freeze-clamping, in each age group, BAT, kidney, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous fat, and epi fat were extracted from a set of five mice, and brain, liver, heart, spleen, and lung were from another set of five mice.
Following freeze-clamping, five old and five young biological replicate samples for each tissue were homogenized in ice-cold 20% TCA using TissueLyser II (QIAGEN). The lysate from each biological replicate was split into two identical half-samples containing approximately 200 μg protein each then washed with 20% TCA, 10% TCA, and 5% TCA twice. One half-sample was resuspended in blocking buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 8 M urea, 2% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTPA, 10 μM neocuproine, and 35 mM IAM) for 2 h at 37°C in the dark on a shaking incubator (1,200 rpm) to block all unmodified cysteine residues, while the other half sample was treated with labeling buffer (100 mM HEPES, 8 M urea, 2% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTPA, 10 μM neocuproine, and 35 mM CPT). After labeling, proteins in both half-samples were precipitated by methanol and chloroform, and resuspended in labeling buffer plus 5 mM TCEP to label reversibly modified cysteines. Proteins were precipitated again and digested with LysC and trypsin as described above. The resulting peptides were purified and reconstituted in 200 mM EPPS pH 8.0. A microBCA assay was then performed to determine the amount of peptide in each tube. Each half-sample (100 μg each) was labeled by a distinct TMT 10-plex reagent as described above. A ratio-check was performed by mixing 2 μL of peptides from each channel, desalting using a stage-tip, and analysis by LC-MS. The remainder of samples were mixed according to the total peptide loading ratios obtained from the ratio-check, and a second ratio-check was performed using 1% of the mixed sample to calculate a ratio to calibrate pipetting errors computationally for data analysis. CPT-labeled cysteine peptides were not included in the ratio-check analysis. The mixed samples were desalted using a Sep-Pak cartridge, treated with Lambda phosphatase, and enriched using IMAC as described above. Enriched cysteine-containing peptides were then fractionated using a high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit (Pierce), combined into six fractions, and purified by stage-tips.
Old and young tissues were homogenized in 200 mM EPPS pH 8.5, 8 M urea, 2% SDS, 1 pellet/50 mL protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo). The mixture was clarified by ultracentrifugation and the supernatant was subjected to BCA protein concentration measurement, followed by reduction with 5 mM TCEP, alkylation with 10 mM IAM, and DTT quenching with 10 mM DTT. A pool was made by mixing 10 μg of all biological replicates of all tissues. After precipitation, proteins in each sample and pool were reconstituted in 200 mM EPPS at pH 8.5 and digested by Lys-C overnight and trypsin for 6 h at a 1:100 enzyme-to-substrate ratio. For each tissue, peptides from five young and five old biological replicates, along with the pool were then labeled by TMT-11plex reagents following the SL-TMT protocol. Peptides in the pool were labeled by the 11 th TMT channel as a bridge standard to enable protein abundance comparison across tissues. After the ratio-check as described above, the TMT-labeled peptides from tissue replicates were evenly mixed, and the bridge was spiked in at a 2:1 ratio. The mixture was desalted and subjected to LC-MS analysis.
All old and young tissues were rapidly weighted and homogenized in cold 80% methanol containing 0.05 ng/ μL thymine-d 4 , 0.05 ng/ μL inosine- 15 N 4 , and 0.1 ng/ μL glycocholate-d 4 at a 4:1 volume to weight ratio. The samples were centrifuged (10 min, 20,000 g, 4°C) twice and the supernatants were subjected to LC-MS analysis as described previously ( Mills et al., 2018 44. Mills, E.L. ∙ Pierce, K.A. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). Internal standard library of all measured metabolites was used to confirm identification.
Protein carbonylation in all Oximouse tissue samples were measured using (Abcam; ab178020) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, equal amounts of protein from were labeled by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) in 2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) for 20 minutes. A pool mixing all young and old tissue replicates were treated with 2N HCl without 2,4-DNPH as a control. The reaction was then neutralized, and 20 μg of protein from each tissue replicate and the pool was loaded onto one gel. Carbonylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-DNP antibody. Total carbonylated protein signal from each lane was quantified in the linear range of detection using ImageJ, and calibrated by total protein loading signal obtained from Ponceau S staining. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) modified proteins were detected and quantified by immunoblotting using the same strategy as above and using the anti-4-HNE antibody (Abcam; ab46545).
For CPT-length/labeling optimization experiments, enriched CPT-labeled peptides were dissolved in a solution containing 5% FA and 5% ACN. One μg of sample was analyzed in a single LC-MS injection by an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (LC) pump, applying a gradient consisting of 3%–18% ACN, 0.125% FA over 190 min at 500 nl min −1 . The LC column was made in house with 75 μm inner diameter microcapillary column packed with 35 cm of GP-18 resin (2.6 μm, 200 Å, Sepax, Newark, DE). Peptide ions were collected in data-dependent mode using a mass range of m/z 350 - 1500. Resolution for MS 1 was set at 120,000, with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4e 5 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The cycle time was 3 s, multiply-charged ions were selected and subjected to fragmentation at 35% normalized collisional energy (NCE) for MS 2 with a dynamic exclusion of 120 s.
The same Easy-nLC 1200 and Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer system was used for the human cell cysteine proteome identification and quantification experiments. For the identification group, 2 μg of peptides from each fraction was loaded and eluted using a gradient consisting of 2%–30% ACN (0.125% FA) over 170 min at 500 nl min −1 . The Thermo FAIMS Pro device was used with default parameters ( Schweppe et al., 2019b 64. Schweppe, D.K. ∙ Prasad, S. ∙ Belford, M.W. ... Characterization and Optimization of Multiplexed Quantitative Analyses Using High-Field Asymmetric-Waveform Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2019; 91 :4010-4016 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). The electrodes of high-Frequency Asymmetric-waveform ion mobility mass spectrometry (FAIMS) source were operated at 100°C and yields a FWHM between 10 V to 15 V. No additional gas was supplied for desolvation. The DV circuitry was tuned using the autotune option to assemble a bisinusoidal waveform with a high amplitude of −5000 V at a 3 MHz frequency. The CV switch time set to 25 ms. Scan range for MS 1 was set to 400-2000, resolution for MS 1 was set at 120,000, with an AGC target of 2e 5 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The cycle time was 1 s between master scans, selected ions were fragmentated at 35% normalized collisional energy (NCE) for MS 2 with a dynamic exclusion of 120 s. For the quantification group, 1 μg of peptides from each fraction was analyzed using gradients with 1%–24% ACN (0.125% FA) over 170 min at 500 nl min −1 with fine adjustments based on the fractions. Each MS cycle contains a full MS scan (400-2,000 m/z), which was acquired in the orbitrap (120,000 resolution AGC 2e 5 ). The subsequent MS 2 was conducted in the ion trap selecting top 20 most abundant ions at a width of 0.7 Th and fragmented at NCE 35%. MS 2 precursors were then isolated using a MultiNotch synchronous precursor selection (SPS) ( McAlister et al., 2014 41. McAlister, G.C. ∙ Nusinow, D.P. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... MultiNotch MS3 enables accurate, sensitive, and multiplexed detection of differential expression across cancer cell line proteomes Anal. Chem. 2014; 86 :7150-7158 Crossref Scopus (872) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the MS 3 -based TMT quantitation. Ten notches were selected and MS 3 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap using HCD at NCE 65%. Resolution for MS 3 is set at 50,000 with AGC 1.5e 5 and a maximum ion accumulation time of 125 ms.
For experiments that determine modification stoichiometry (% oxidation) of cysteines, 1 μg of peptides from each fraction was analyzed using a gradient consisting of 2%–23% (ACN, 0.125% FA) over 170 min at 500 nl min −1 with fine adjustments based on the LC and column conditions. Each MS cycle contains a full MS scan (400-1,400 m/z), which was acquired in the orbitrap (120,000 resolution AGC 2e 5 ). The subsequent MS 2 was conducted in the ion trap selecting the top 20 most abundant ions at a width of 0.7 Th and fragmented at NCE 35%. To minimize TMT quantification interference, MS 2 precursors were then isolated using the SPS method described above for MS 3 -based TMT quantitation. Ten notches were selected and MS 3 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap using HCD at NCE 65%. Resolution for MS 3 is set at 50,000 with AGC 1.5e 5 and a maximum ion accumulation time of 125 ms.
For protein abundance measurement, each tissue was analyzed using a single 170 min run with 3%–20% ACN at 500 nl min −1 flow rate. Unfractionated, labeled tissue peptides were injected into an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos with a FAIMSPro (Thermo) device for FAIMS separation of precursors ( Schweppe et al., 2019b 64. Schweppe, D.K. ∙ Prasad, S. ∙ Belford, M.W. ... Characterization and Optimization of Multiplexed Quantitative Analyses Using High-Field Asymmetric-Waveform Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2019; 91 :4010-4016 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). The FAIMS device was operated at a dispersion voltage of −5000V and multiple compensation voltages (−40V/-60V/-80V). Full MS was operated with a scan range 400-2000 m/z at 120,000 resolution. Tandem mass spectra (MS 2 ) were matched in real time to targeted proteins ( Schweppe et al., 2019a 62. Schweppe, D.K. ∙ Eng, J.K. ∙ Bailey, D. ... Full-featured, real-time database searching platform enables fast and accurate multiplexed quantitative proteomics bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). When a peptide match was observed to a targeted protein, a quantitative SPS-MS 3 scan was acquired. Post-acquisition processing used all MS 2 peptide spectral matches for identification and filtering. Quantitative data was filtered as described below.
Protein affinity purification experiments were analyzed using a 3%–28% ACN gradient over 43 min at 500 nl min −1 . Each MS cycle contains a full MS scan (400-1,400 m/z, 120,000 resolution, AGC 2e 5 ). The subsequent MS 2 was conducted in the ion trap selected top 10 most abundant ions at a width of 0.7 Th and fragmented at NCE 35%. Ten notches in MS 2 were selected and MS 3 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap using HCD at NCE 65%. Resolution for MS 3 is set at 50,000 with AGC 1.5e 5 and a maximum ion accumulation time of 150 ms.
For metabolite tracing experiments 10 μL of metabolite extracts were loaded onto a Luna-HILIC column (Phenomenex) using an UltiMate-3000 TPLRS LC with 10% mobile phase A (20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in water) and 90% mobile phase B (10 mM ammonium hydroxide in 75:25 v/v acetonitrile/methanol). Elution was performed using a 10-min linear gradient to 99% mobile phase A, and metabolites were analyzed with a Q-Exactive™ HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo). Negative ion mode was used with full scan analysis over m/z 70-750 m/z at 60,000 resolution, 1e 6 AGC, and 100 ms maximum ion accumulation time. Additional MS settings were: ion spray voltage, 3.8 kV; capillary temperature, 350°C; probe heater temperature, 320°C; sheath gas, 50; auxiliary gas, 15; and S-lens RF level 40.
For CPT-length/labeling optimization experiments, the SEQUEST algorithm ( Eng et al., 1994 17. Eng, J.K. ∙ McCormack, A.L. ∙ Yates, J.R. An approach to correlate tandem mass spectral data of peptides with amino acid sequences in a protein database J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5 :976-989 Crossref Scopus (5641) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to search all MS/MS spectra against a database containing sequences of mouse ( Mus musculus ) proteins downloaded from UniProt ( https://www.uniprot.org/ , 2014). Reversed sequences were appended as decoys for FDR filtering, and common contaminant proteins (e.g., human keratins, trypsin) were included. The following parameters were used for the database search: 25 ppm precursor mass tolerance; 1.0 Da product ion mass tolerance; fully tryptic digestion; up to three missed cleavages; variable modifications: oxidation of methionine (+15.9949) and CPT modification on cysteine residues (2-CPT: +165.01910, 3-CPT: +179.03474, 6C-CPT: +221.08169). The target-decoy method was employed to control the false discovery rate (FDR) ( Elias and Gygi, 2007; Huttlin et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2003 16. Elias, J.E. ∙ Gygi, S.P. Target-decoy search strategy for increased confidence in large-scale protein identifications by mass spectrometry Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :207-214 Crossref Scopus (3053) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Hegeman, A.D. ∙ Harms, A.C. ... Prediction of error associated with false-positive rate determination for peptide identification in large-scale proteomics experiments using a combined reverse and forward peptide sequence database strategy J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Peng, J. ∙ Elias, J.E. ∙ Thoreen, C.C. ... Evaluation of multidimensional chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS) for large-scale protein analysis: the yeast proteome J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2 :43-50 Crossref Scopus (1420) PubMed Google Scholar ). To distinguish correct and incorrect peptide identifications, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to control peptide-level FDR to less than 0.5%, and minimum XCorr was set to 1.0 during filtering. Peptides shorter than six amino acids were discarded.
For experiments analyzing human cell cysteine proteome, database searching was conducted as described above. Human ( Homo sapiens ) database was downloaded from UniProt ( https://www.uniprot.org/ , 2014). Common contaminants and decoys were appended as described above. Oxidation of methionine (+15.9949) and 6C-CPT modification on cysteine residues (+221.08169) were set as dynamic modifications, whereas TMT (+229.162932) on lysines and protein N-termini was static. Peptide-level FDR was set to 0.5% filtering labeled cysteine-containing peptides, and then protein-level FDR was controlled to 1%. Using a reductionist model, peptides were matched to the least amount of proteins. TMT reporter ions were used for quantification ( Ting et al., 2011 68. Ting, L. ∙ Rad, R. ∙ Gygi, S.P. ... MS3 eliminates ratio distortion in isobaric multiplexed quantitative proteomics Nat. Methods. 2011; 8 :937-940 Crossref Scopus (790) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peptides with total signal-to-noise ratio larger than 100 and isolation specificity higher than 0.5 were considered quantified. The summed signal-to-noise (S/N) value for all peptides from a given protein was used to quantify protein abundance.
For experiments that determine stoichiometry (% oxidation) on cysteines, the aforementioned mouse database was used for searching. Methionine oxidation (+15.9949) and cysteine 6C-CPT modification (+221.08169) were dynamic modifications, and TMT (+229.162932) on lysines and protein N-termini was static. Peptide-level FDR was set to 0.5% filtering labeled cysteine-containing peptides, and protein-level FDR was controlled to 1%. Consequently, peptide reverse hits were further dramatically decreased. Peptides were matched to the least number of sites. TMT reporter ion signal-to-noise ratios for all peptides matched to the same site were used to quantify the site.
For protein abundance measurements, methionine oxidation (+15.9949) was set as a dynamic modification, and TMT (+229.162932) on lysines and protein N-termini was static. Peptide-level FDR was set to 0.5% and protein-level FDR was controlled to 1%. TMT reporter ion signal-to-noise ratios for all quantified peptides matched to the same protein were summed up, and calibrated to the bridge channel to report protein abundance in tissues.
Spectra in the affinity purification experiments were searched against the aforementioned human database. Methionine oxidation (+15.9949) was set as dynamic modifications, and TMT (+229.162932) on lysines and protein N-termini was static. Peptide-level FDR was set to 0.5%, and protein-level FDR was controlled to 1%. For any given protein, quantitation was performed by summing the signal-to-noise for all peptides. Protein abundance was normalized to ensure equal loading of the bait (i.e., RARS and QARS) in all but the GFP channel. Background noise for all proteins was removed using the GFP channel.
A ModScore was calculated for each cysteine site in order to evaluate the confidence of site localization ( Beausoleil et al., 2006 5. Beausoleil, S.A. ∙ Villén, J. ∙ Gerber, S.A. ... A probability-based approach for high-throughput protein phosphorylation analysis and site localization Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24 :1285-1292 Crossref Scopus (1296) PubMed Google Scholar ). This algorithm examines the presence of MS/MS fragment ions unique to each cysteine site on the same peptide to evaluate whether the best site match is correct when comparing to the next best match. Sites with Modscore ≥ 13 (p ≤ 0.05) were considered to be confidently localized. For quantification, sites from peptides with only one site quantified are listed in the “single” category, and the rest are in the “composite” category. Due to the fact that cysteine is a rare amino acid, most sites are single sites and unambiguously localized on the parent peptides.
All TMT channels were calibrated according to the second ratio-check described above to ensure the same amount of peptides were loaded to each channel prior to enrichment,and that pipetting errors were corrected. For each site, TMT reporter ion signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) from the oxidized cysteine channel was divided by S/N from the fully TMT-labeled cysteine channel of the same protein to obtain the % reversible oxidation value, effectively controlling for proteins abundance change. Values from five biological replicates were used to calculate the average and standard error of the mean (SE). All single and composite sites are listed in the supplementary tables. Single sites quantified from high confidence peptides (sum S/N > 200, isolation specificity > 0.75) were used for population data analyses. Unless otherwise stated, we considered sites with percent oxidation changes ± 10% and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value ≤ 0.01 as “changed significantly.” For redox network analyses we define cysteines with % oxidation ≥ 20% as extensively/highly modified.
All analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2 unless otherwise noted. Protein subcellular locations were downloaded from Human Proteome Atlas based on data reported previously ( Thul et al., 2017 67. Thul, P.J. ∙ Åkesson, L. ∙ Wiking, M. ... A subcellular map of the human proteome Science. 2017; 356 :eaal3321 Crossref Scopus (1714) PubMed Google Scholar ) with experimental evidence, and matched to the Oximouse dataset. Nucleoplasm, nuclear speckles, nuclear bodies, nuclear membrane, nucleus, nucleoli (fibrillar center), and nucleoli were consolidated into the nucleus annotation. To minimize localization ambiguity, only proteins with single primary subcellular location reported were used. Secreted proteins did not present in the aforementioned database, and therefore singly-located proteins in “vesicles” category, and non-localized proteins were further queried from the secreted protein database downloaded from UniProt to generate a secreted protein list. Type I and II transmembrane proteins were downloaded from UniProt.
Heatmaps highlighting tissue-specific redox modifications with no missing values were generated using sites that are quantified in every tissue ( Figures 1 and 5 ). Tissues were clustered using hierarchical clustering calculating Euclidean distance, and complete linkage type. Sites were clustered using K-means (K = 10) and manually annotated. K-means clustering was performed multiple times without fixed random seed to ensure tissue-specific site clusters were reproducibly observed. Young and old tissues were separately clustered. Sites in the highly-oxidized cluster of a given young tissue were extracted, and then compared with sites in the highly-oxidized cluster of the same old tissue ( Figure 5 J). Clustering of all sites, including missing values, was performed by assigning to missing values the average % oxidation of the entire cysteine population ( Figure S3 A). Hierarchical clustering was performed for tissues and K-means clustering performed for sites. When performing hierarchical clustering of cysteine site changes during aging, comparisons involving missing values were assigned as no change. Rows that only include comparisons with missing values were removed ( Figure 5 K).
Protein networks were downloaded from Bioplex 2.0 where all data were generated with evidence from affinity pull-down and MS experiments ( Huttlin et al., 2017 32. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Bruckner, R.J. ∙ Paulo, J.A. ... Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks Nature. 2017; 545 :505-509 Crossref Scopus (950) PubMed Google Scholar ). The % oxidation value of the highest oxidized site on each protein was used to represent the maximum extent to which this protein was ROS-modified, and was mapped onto the Bioplex 2.0 network. Network visualization was performed in Cytoscape 3.6.2 ( Shannon et al., 2003 66. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (31279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Proteins with at least one site over 20% modified are regarded as highly-oxidized proteins, and interactions between two highly-oxidized proteins in the same tissue are considered a concerted oxidation event. To investigate whether the extent of coordinated redox modification in a protein network is more ubiquitous or tissue-selective, each network was scored by the percent of its constituent proteins that contain at least one highly oxidized cysteine in the same tissue. Non-identified proteins in communities were conservatively assigned as not highly oxidized to minimize false positive results. Coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated for each community across all tissue as an assessment of ubiquitous or tissue-selective regulations. Communities with no highly modified proteins in any tissues were labeled as non-redox regulated. In addition, proteins that were reported as redox-sensitive previously ( Menger et al., 2015; Topf et al., 2018; van der Reest et al., 2018 43. Menger, K.E. ∙ James, A.M. ∙ Cochemé, H.M. ... Fasting, but Not Aging, Dramatically Alters the Redox Status of Cysteine Residues on Proteins in Drosophila melanogaster Cell Rep. 2015; 11 :1856-1865 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Topf, U. ∙ Suppanz, I. ∙ Samluk, L. ... Quantitative proteomics identifies redox switches for global translation modulation by mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :324 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar 71. van der Reest, J. ∙ Lilla, S. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Proteome-wide analysis of cysteine oxidation reveals metabolic sensitivity to redox stress Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1581 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ) were extracted, mapped onto the highly-oxidized proteins in Oximouse, and overlap was analyzed in Bioplex 2.0 network to identify potential redox-regulated networks conserved across model organisms.
Analysis of mouse protein secondary structures was based on the secondary structure database from UniProt. List of cysteine sites that could engage in disulfide formation were also downloaded from UniProt. GO enrichment was analyzed using GOrilla ( Eden et al., 2007, 2009 14. Eden, E. ∙ Lipson, D. ∙ Yogev, S. ... Discovering motifs in ranked lists of DNA sequences PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3 :e39 Crossref Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar 15. Eden, E. ∙ Navon, R. ∙ Steinfeld, I. ... GOrilla: a tool for discovery and visualization of enriched GO terms in ranked gene lists BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :48 Crossref Scopus (2411) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each tissue, the foreground contains proteins with highly-oxidized sites (> 20%), and the background contains all proteins quantified in this tissue. GO terms with p values smaller than 1e -3 were listed for each tissue, and subjected to hierarchical clustering calculating Euclidean distance. Missing p values across tissues were conservatively assigned as 1 and considered as not enriched.
Analysis of proximal amino acids was performed by extracting motifs (lengths of 9 or 13 amino acids) centered around each quantified cysteine site in the Oximouse dataset. Motifs were separated into two groups based on whether or not the motif contains the amino acid being tested (central cysteine excluded). Average % oxidation values of the central cysteines in these two groups were calculated, and the difference between the averages was used to determine whether the proximal amino acid being tested has a negative or positive influence on % cysteine oxidation. To visualize motifs, the pLogo algorithm was used ( O’Shea et al., 2013 47. O’Shea, J.P. ∙ Chou, M.F. ∙ Quader, S.A. ... pLogo: a probabilistic approach to visualizing sequence motifs Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :1211-1212 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ). Motifs with total length of 13 amino acids were analyzed. For each tissue, the foreground contains motifs with highly oxidized central cysteines, the background contains all motifs quantified. Foreground sequences were not subtracted from the background. To test whether phosphorylation on proximal amino acids regulates oxidation, we mapped phosphorylation sites from the Phosphomouse dataset ( Huttlin et al., 2010 30. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ∙ Elias, J.E. ... A tissue-specific atlas of mouse protein phosphorylation and expression Cell. 2010; 143 :1174-1189 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar ) onto cysteine motifs (central cysteine ± 6 amino acid residues) using seven tissues (brown fat, brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung) analyzed in both datasets. Probability of presence of highly modified cysteine in a phosphorylation-containing motif, and probability of phosphorylation in a motif containing highly-modified cysteine were calculated.
Disease-gene associations were downloaded from the DisGeNET database ( Piñero et al., 2015 53. Piñero, J. ∙ Queralt-Rosinach, N. ∙ Bravo, À. ... DisGeNET: a discovery platform for the dynamical exploration of human diseases and their genes Database (Oxford). 2015; 2015 :bav028 Crossref Scopus (748) PubMed Google Scholar ). The curated table with partly redundant disease annotations were used for analysis excluding networks with fewer than three members. The entire Oximouse dataset was mapped onto this database. A hypergeometric test was applied to determine significant associations between highly (> 20%) cysteine oxidized protein members in a given disease network. Odds ratios were calculated for this relationship in each disease network separately in young and old tissues, and this was used to assess age-depended enrichment of each network. P values obtained from the hypergeometric tests were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
The Oximouse web application ( https://oximouse.hms.harvard.edu ) runs on a Linux virtual machine (Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS, Apache 2.4.7). Static resources (i.e., for cysteine oxidation site information and BioPlex network interactions ( Huttlin et al., 2017; Schweppe et al., 2018 32. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Bruckner, R.J. ∙ Paulo, J.A. ...

Proteome Res. 2018; 17 :722-726 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) are loaded using D3 (v5.9.7) and processed for display and user interaction via application-specific Javascript methods. Protein information is queried from the Uniprot REST API for each protein to ascertain protein sequences and general information pertaining to function ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/doc/ ). Once processed these data are displayed using: (1) plotly.js for heatmaps and column plots ( https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js ), (2) cytoscape.js for graph plotting ( Franz et al., 2016 18. Franz, M. ∙ Lopes, C.T. ∙ Huck, G. ...

More information on the use and features of the web application can be found on the OxiMouse help page ( https://oximouse.hms.harvard.edu/help.html ).
Data was processed and significance defined using the pipeline described in the section above. Data analysis was performed in Excel, R, Prism, and Pymol, as described above. All data (unless otherwise noted) were presented as mean ± SE. P values were calculated using two-tailed Student’s t test for pairwise comparison of variables, and multiple comparisons were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Sites with percent oxidation changes ± 10% and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value ≤ 0.01 as “changed significantly.” Unless otherwise noted, all stated replicates are biological replicates.
