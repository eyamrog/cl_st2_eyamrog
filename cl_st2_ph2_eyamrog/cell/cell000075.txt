Title: Early Fate Defines Microglia and Non-parenchymal Brain Macrophage Development


Abstract: Summary

Central nervous system (CNS) macrophages comprise microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs) residing in the meninges, the choroid plexus, and the perivascular spaces. Most CNS macrophages emerge during development, with the exception of choroid plexus and dural macrophages, which are replaced by monocytes in adulthood. Whether microglia and BAMs share a developmental program or arise from separate lineages remains unknown. Here, we identified two phenotypically, transcriptionally, and locally distinct brain macrophages throughout development, giving rise to either microglia or BAMs. Two macrophage populations were already present in the yolk sac suggesting an early segregation. Fate-mapping models revealed that BAMs mostly derived from early erythro-myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. The development of microglia was dependent on TGF-β, whereas the genesis of BAMs occurred independently of this cytokine. Collectively, our data show that developing parenchymal and non-parenchymal brain macrophages are separate entities in terms of ontogeny, gene signature, and requirement for TGF-β.

Section: Introduction

Microglia are the resident macrophages in the CNS parenchyma and are derived from primitive macrophages ( Ginhoux et al., 2010 17. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ... Fate mapping analysis reveals that adult microglia derive from primitive macrophages Science. 2010; 330 :841-845 Crossref Scopus (3686) PubMed Google Scholar ), which arise from early erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the yolk sac at embryonic day (E)8.5 ( Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015; Hoeffel et al., 2015; Kierdorf et al., 2013 19.

With the establishment of the blood circulation, these primitive macrophages migrate into the developing brain at E9.5 where they give rise to microglia ( Ginhoux et al., 2010; Schulz et al., 2012 17.

The molecular signature of microglia is shaped by a combination of CNS-derived signals and ontogeny ( Bennett et al., 2018; Buttgereit et al., 2016; Shemer et al., 2018 5.

Engrafted parenchymal brain macrophages differ from microglia in transcriptome, chromatin landscape and response to challenge Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5206 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, recent reports revealed microglia heterogeneity across different regions and different ages in the healthy brain ( Hammond et al., 2019; Masuda et al., 2019; Silvin and Ginhoux, 2018 22. Hammond, T.R. ∙ Dufort, C. ∙ Dissing-Olesen, L. ...

Silvin, A. ∙ Ginhoux, F. Microglia heterogeneity along a spatio-temporal axis: More questions than answers Glia. 2018; 66 :2045-2057 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). In comparison to microglia, the ontogeny, function, and transcriptome of non-parenchymal brain macrophages (i.e., border-associated macrophages [BAMs]) during embryogenesis or adulthood is less well characterized. Non-parenchymal macrophages reside at the borders of the CNS, namely, the choroid plexus, meninges, and perivascular spaces. It was suggested that subdural and perivascular macrophages arise from the same embryonic precursor as microglia, while choroid plexus macrophages have a dual origin being replaced with time by adult bone marrow (BM) monocytes ( Goldmann et al., 2016; Van Hove et al., 2019 18. Goldmann, T. ∙ Wieghofer, P. ∙ Jordão, M.J. ... Origin, fate and dynamics of macrophages at central nervous system interfaces Nat.

A single-cell atlas of mouse brain macrophages reveals unique transcriptional identities shaped by ontogeny and tissue environment Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, precursors emerging after the appearance of early EMPs and the initial wave of primitive hematopoiesis appear to contribute to some extent to the pool of macrophages in the choroid plexus and the pia mater ( Goldmann et al., 2016 18. Goldmann, T. ∙ Wieghofer, P. ∙ Jordão, M.J. ... Origin, fate and dynamics of macrophages at central nervous system interfaces Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :797-805 Crossref Scopus (772) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the origin of macrophages in the dura mater, which contains a more permissive barrier harboring a network of lymphatic and blood vessels is to date unknown ( Antila et al., 2017; Louveau et al., 2015 2. Antila, S. ∙ Karaman, S. ∙ Nurmi, H. ... Development and plasticity of meningeal lymphatic vessels J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :3645-3667 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Louveau, A. ∙ Smirnov, I. ∙ Keyes, T.J. ... Structural and functional features of central nervous system lymphatic vessels Nature. 2015; 523 :337-341 Crossref Scopus (3024) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Similar to most other macrophage populations, both BAMs and microglia are dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) signaling ( Ginhoux et al., 2010; Mrdjen et al., 2018; Van Hove et al., 2019 17. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ...

Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the differentiation of microglia and BAMs relies on the transcription factors PU.1 and IRF8 ( Goldmann et al., 2016; Kierdorf et al., 2013; Van Hove et al., 2019 18. Goldmann, T. ∙ Wieghofer, P. ∙ Jordão, M.J. ... Origin, fate and dynamics of macrophages at central nervous system interfaces Nat.

Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was also previously suggested that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is critical for microglia development including the induction of microglia signature genes ( Butovsky et al., 2014 9. Butovsky, O. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ∙ Moore, C.S. ... Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :131-143 Crossref Scopus (1831) PubMed Google Scholar ). Postnatal deletion of Tgfbr2 in microglia leads to their activation ( Arnold et al., 2019; Buttgereit et al., 2016; Zöller et al., 2018 4. Arnold, T.D. ∙ Lizama, C.O. ∙ Cautivo, K.M. ...

Silencing of TGFβ signalling in microglia results in impaired homeostasis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4011 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicating that this pathway regulates microglial homeostatic functions. As a consequence, long-term loss of TGF-β receptor (TGF-βR) signaling in microglia or monocyte-derived microglia-like cells caused fatal demyelinating disease or neuromotor dysfunction ( Arnold et al., 2019; Lund et al., 2018 4. Arnold, T.D. ∙ Lizama, C.O. ∙ Cautivo, K.M. ... Impaired αVβ8 and TGFβ signaling lead to microglial dysmaturation and neuromotor dysfunction J. Exp.

Fatal demyelinating disease is induced by monocyte-derived macrophages in the absence of TGF-β signaling Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether TGF-β is a critical player in regulating BAM development or function has not been addressed so far.
Microglia appear to maintain CNS homeostasis, participate in neuronal circuit formation, and regulate synaptic plasticity and transmission and are involved in neurogenesis in the developing and adult CNS ( Schafer and Stevens, 2015; Squarzoni et al., 2014; Wolf et al., 2017 54.

Wolf, S.A. ∙ Boddeke, H.W. ∙ Kettenmann, H. Microglia in Physiology and Disease Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79 :619-643 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dysregulation of microglia has been linked to developmental and neurodegenerative diseases ( Colonna and Butovsky, 2017 12. Colonna, M. ∙ Butovsky, O. Microglia Function in the Central Nervous System During Health and Neurodegeneration Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35 :441-468 Crossref Scopus (1474) PubMed Google Scholar ). In such neuropathologies, a fraction of microglia alters its molecular signature and phenotypic appearance and is referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAMs) ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Krasemann et al., 2017 31.

The TREM2-APOE Pathway Drives the Transcriptional Phenotype of Dysfunctional Microglia in Neurodegenerative Diseases Immunity. 2017; 47 :566-581 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1559) PubMed Google Scholar ). Assigning specific contributions of microglia and BAMs to CNS development, integrity, and pathology has been difficult in the past due to the lack of unambiguous distinctive features between them. In addition, in neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative conditions, peripheral myeloid cells invade the brain concomitant with a change of marker expression on resident macrophages, further complicating their identification. However, recent advances in multi-parametric single-cell analysis of myeloid cells in the adult CNS revealed new markers for BAMs ( Goldmann et al., 2016; Jordão et al., 2019; Mrdjen et al., 2018; Van Hove et al., 2019; Zeisel et al., 2015 18.

Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2015; 347 :1138-1142 Crossref Scopus (2104) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, adult BAMs can be distinguished from microglia by differential expression of Siglec1 (CD169), the mannose receptor CD206, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor 1 (Lyve1), CD38, MHCII, CD11c, and the scavenger receptor CD163 ( Mrdjen et al., 2018 47.

High-Dimensional Single-Cell Mapping of Central Nervous System Immune Cells Reveals Distinct Myeloid Subsets in Health, Aging, and Disease Immunity. 2018; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (563) Google Scholar ). On the other hand, microglia are negative for these markers but express Tmem119 , P2ry12 , Sall3 , and Sall1 ( Butovsky et al., 2014; Buttgereit et al., 2016; Lavin et al., 2014; Masuda et al., 2019 9.

Masuda, T. ∙ Sankowski, R. ∙ Staszewski, O. ... Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of mouse and human microglia at single-cell resolution Nature. 2019; Crossref Scopus (765) Google Scholar ). Whether BAMs and microglia constitute distinct lineages or acquire their specific features locally, through interaction with their respective niches remains unknown.
Here, we profiled murine embryonic microglia and BAMs using high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry combined with in-depth transcriptome analysis. We found two phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct macrophages in the developing brain, which independently gave rise to BAMs and microglia, respectively. Two separate macrophage populations could also be distinguished in the yolk sac, suggestive of an early developmental hard wiring. Supporting the notion that the development of these two macrophage populations stems from an early bifurcation of primitive macrophages, only microglia are dependent on TGF-β, whereas BAMs arise and maintain independently. Our study reveals that BAMs and microglia arise from the same primitive progenitors that separate early into two distinct macrophage populations (CD206 + and CD206 – ).

To interrogate whether microglia and BAMs represent independent populations already in embryogenesis, we first profiled all macrophages from wild-type (WT) brains at E16.5 using scRNA-seq. We chose E16.5 as a time point at which microglia already start differentiating and expressing signature genes ( Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016; Thion et al., 2018 46.

Microbiome Influences Prenatal and Adult Microglia in a Sex-Specific Manner Cell. 2018; 172 :500-516 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ). This unbiased single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed two distinct clusters of macrophages ( Figure 1 A). One cluster was enriched in microglia signature genes such as Sall1 , P2ry12 , Hexb , Trem2 , Fcrls , and Siglech and expressed higher levels of Itgam (CD11b) and Cx3cr1 ( Figures 1 B and 1C) ( Butovsky et al., 2014; Hammond et al., 2019; Lavin et al., 2014; Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016 9.

Microglia development follows a stepwise program to regulate brain homeostasis Science. 2016; 353 :aad8670 Crossref Scopus (808) PubMed Google Scholar ). The other cluster expressed Mrc1 (the gene encoding CD206), Lyve1 and Ms4a4a , previously associated with characteristic genes in adult BAMs ( Figures 1 B and 1C) ( Goldmann et al., 2016; Jordão et al., 2019; Mrdjen et al., 2018; Van Hove et al., 2019 18.

These data demonstrate the coexistence of two transcriptionally distinct populations of macrophages in the embryonic brain already at E16.5, which may correspond to microglia and BAMs, respectively.
We next assessed the emergence and phenotypic profile of embryonic brain macrophages by flow cytometry to validate our observations from scRNA-seq. We were able to distinguish two distinct macrophage populations by CD11b and F4/80, or CX3CR1 and CD206, respectively ( Figure 2 A; Figure S1 A). Both populations were present at similar ratios and numbers throughout development ( Figures 2 A and 2B). We previously described the transcriptional regulator Sall1 as a microglia-defining marker ( Buttgereit et al., 2016; Thion et al., 2018 10. Buttgereit, A. ∙ Lelios, I. ∙ Yu, X. ... Sall1 is a transcriptional regulator defining microglia identity and function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1397-1406 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Thion, M.S. ∙ Low, D. ∙ Silvin, A. ... Microbiome Influences Prenatal and Adult Microglia in a Sex-Specific Manner Cell. 2018; 172 :500-516 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using Sall1 -reporter mice ( Sall1 GFP/+ ), we found the CD206 – population to initiate Sall1 (GFP) expression from E14.5 onward confirming that they are microglia, whereas the CD206 + population remained negative for GFP throughout embryogenesis ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Figure S1 B). Conversely, the CX3CR1 lo population expressed CD206 at all time points and acquired Lyve1 from E12.5 onward ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Figure S1 B), likely representing BAMs. Both populations expressed common macrophage markers MerTK, CD64, CX3CR1, and CD16/32 ( Figure 2 D), and macrophage-associated transcription factors such as PU.1, IRF8, and IRF4 ( Figure S1 C). Expression of MHCII and CD11c was previously described on a subset of adult BAMs and DAMs ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Mrdjen et al., 2018 31. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Spinrad, A. ∙ Weiner, A. ...

High-Dimensional Single-Cell Mapping of Central Nervous System Immune Cells Reveals Distinct Myeloid Subsets in Health, Aging, and Disease Immunity. 2018; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (563) Google Scholar ). During embryogenesis, however, macrophages in the brain were negative for MHCII and only few BAMs expressed CD11c ( Figure S1 D). The integrin and adhesion molecule CD49d, previously associated with monocyte-derived macrophages but not microglia ( Bowman et al., 2016 7. Bowman, R.L. ∙ Klemm, F. ∙ Akkari, L. ... Macrophage Ontogeny Underlies Differences in Tumor-Specific Education in Brain Malignancies Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :2445-2459 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ), was initially identified on both populations but was later on downregulated in microglia ( Figure S1 D). CD38, described on adult BAM subsets ( Mrdjen et al., 2018; Van Hove et al., 2019 47. Mrdjen, D. ∙ Pavlovic, A. ∙ Hartmann, F.J. ...

Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ), was detected on BAMs only toward the end of embryogenesis ( Figure S1 D). We also identified Tim-4 as a common BAM marker throughout development ( Figure S1 D). In contrast to adult BAMs, which display regional heterogeneity (i.e., CD206, MHCII, CD38, Lyve1) ( Jordão et al., 2019; Mrdjen et al., 2018; Van Hove et al., 2019 28. Jordão, M.J.C. ∙ Sankowski, R. ∙ Brendecke, S.M. ...

Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ), embryonic BAMs appeared homogeneous in terms of these markers. Thus, two phenotypically distinct macrophage populations could be identified in the developing brain, which was confirmed by unsupervised clustering ( Figure 2 D; Figure S2 A), suggesting that CD206 + macrophages differentiate into BAMs, whereas the CD206 – cells progressively expressing Sall1 correspond to microglia.
To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed their locations by flow cytometry by separating the meninges and the choroid plexus from the CNS parenchyma in Sall1 GFP/+ embryos ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Figures S2 B and S2C). At E18.5, we were able to assign the majority of CD206 – macrophages (Sall1(GFP) + Lyve1 – , microglia) to the parenchyma and most CD206 + macrophages (Lyve1 + , BAMs) to the meninges and the choroid plexus ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Figures S2 B and S2C). The few CD206 + macrophages found in the parenchyma were most likely perivascular macrophages (see also Figure 4 C) ( Mrdjen et al., 2018; Zeisel et al., 2015 47.

Immunofluorescence stainings of Sall1 GFP/+ brains (E18.5) further supported these findings. GFP + (Iba1 + ) macrophages were located in the parenchyma, while Lyve1 + (Iba1 + ) macrophages resided in the meninges or the choroid plexus or were associated with vessels (Collagen IV + ) ( Figure 2 G). On a side note, GFP + Iba1 – cells are neuronal and glial progenitor cells, which also express Sall1 in the developing brain ( Harrison et al., 2012 23. Harrison, S.J. ∙ Nishinakamura, R. ∙ Jones, K.R. ... Sall1 regulates cortical neurogenesis and laminar fate specification in mice: implications for neural abnormalities in Townes-Brocks syndrome Dis. Model. Mech. 2012; 5 :351-365 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the specific regional distribution of these two macrophage populations strengthened the notion that CD206 + macrophages and CD206 – macrophages are embryonic BAMs and microglia, respectively.
To further deep-mine the molecular signature of developing brain macrophages, we performed bulk RNA-seq of embryonic BAMs and microglia from WT brains throughout development. Hierarchical clustering and principal-component analysis revealed two distinct clusters at all stages of development (E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5) ( Figure 3 A; Figure S3 A). Already at E10.5, the two populations clearly segregated, suggesting an early developmental bifurcation ( Figure 3 A). Among the top 200 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between microglia and BAMs were Axl , Pdgfb , Serpinf1 , Ccl3 (microglia), and Cd163 , Cd36 , Slc5a6 , Clec10a (BAMs) at all time points ( Figure 3 B). We further confirmed previously described signature genes for microglia (e.g., Sall1 , Sall3 , and Itgam ) and BAMs ( Siglec1 , Mrc1 , Lyve1 ) with increasing expression across embryonic development ( Figure 3 C). These results suggest that, prior to birth, BAMs and microglia have partly adopted the molecular core profile described in adulthood ( Butovsky et al., 2014; Van Hove et al., 2019 9. Butovsky, O. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ∙ Moore, C.S. ... Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :131-143 Crossref Scopus (1831) PubMed Google Scholar 63. Van Hove, H. ∙ Martens, L. ∙ Scheyltjens, I. ... A single-cell atlas of mouse brain macrophages reveals unique transcriptional identities shaped by ontogeny and tissue environment Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Among the top DEGs we also identified “novel” BAM signature genes. We found for example the endocytic adaptor protein disabled-2 ( Dab2) , which is a negative immune regulator and an adaptor for TGF-β signaling ( Figure 3 D) ( Adamson et al., 2016 1. Adamson, S.E. ∙ Griffiths, R. ∙ Moravec, R. ... Disabled homolog 2 controls macrophage phenotypic polarization and adipose tissue inflammation J. Clin. Invest. 2016; 126 :1311-1322 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, the scavenger receptor Msr1 and the C-type lectin Mgl2 and the family member Clec4a1 were enriched in BAMs while absent in microglia. Interestingly, CD200r1 , which is an immunomodulatory receptor controlling microglia quiescence ( Lyons et al., 2007 41. Lyons, A. ∙ Downer, E.J. ∙ Crotty, S. ... CD200 ligand receptor interaction modulates microglial activation in vivo and in vitro: a role for IL-4 J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :8309-8313 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ), was also highly expressed in embryonic BAMs. In addition, Folr2 , Fcna , and the transcription factor Nfxl1 appear to be BAM signature genes.
We verified the expression of some of these BAM markers also on protein level (flow cytometry and histology). Upregulation of CD301b ( Mgl2 ), CD204 ( Mrs1 ), Folr2, and CD200R was observed in BAMs, while microglia remained negative at all time points analyzed ( Figures 3 E and 3F; Figures S3 B and S3C).
The differential expression of chemokines and integrins in BAMs ( Pf4 encoding CXCL4, Itga4 encoding CD49d) and microglia ( Ccr5 , Itgam , Cx3cr1 ) possibly allows migration and cellular adhesion to their specific locations ( Figures 1 C, 3B, and 3 C; Figures S1 D and S3 D).
Furthermore, gene cluster analysis of each population across the different developmental stages also uncovered fundamental changes between microglia and BAMs ( Figures S3 E and S3F). Pathways enriched in microglia at early stages of development included for example DNA damage response and cell-cycle control, whereas at later stages genes associated with neuroinflammation signaling, immune signaling, axonal guidance, and semaphorin signaling pathways showed higher expression in microglia ( Figures S3 E and S3F). Conversely, while genes linked to cell-cycle control and protein ubiquitination were highly expressed in early stage BAMs; at later developmental phases, BAMs were enriched for pathways in antigen presentation, interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling, and CD40 signaling. Altogether, the differential gene expression profiles across embryogenesis reflect two independent macrophage populations equipped to execute temporal and regional functions during brain development.
To address whether BAMs and microglia arise from the same precursor and diverge in the brain or whether they descend from different progenitors, we analyzed earlier time points and sites of their emergence. At E8.5 and E9.5, primitive macrophages in the yolk sac expressed CX3CR1 and were F4/80 hi , CD16/32 + , and CD11b lo ( Figures 4 A and 4B, data not shown) as demonstrated previously ( Ginhoux et al., 2010; Kierdorf et al., 2013 17. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ... Fate mapping analysis reveals that adult microglia derive from primitive macrophages Science. 2010; 330 :841-845 Crossref Scopus (3686) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Kierdorf, K. ∙ Erny, D. ∙ Goldmann, T. ... Microglia emerge from erythromyeloid precursors via Pu.1- and Irf8-dependent pathways Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :273-280 Crossref Scopus (1048) PubMed Google Scholar ). A phenotypically similar population was found in the brain at E9.5. One day later (E10.5), approximately 50% of primitive macrophages expressed CD206 (and higher levels of F4/80), both in the yolk sac and the brain ( Figures 4 A and 4B; Figures S4 A–S4C). At E11.5, the CD206 + population was the predominant population in the yolk sac, while both CD206 + and CD206 – macrophages were present in the brain.
We then asked whether the CD206 – and CD206 + macrophages at E10.5 already seed into their respective niches within the brain or whether they are randomly distributed. At E10.5, both macrophage populations (CD206 – and CD206 + ) mostly accumulated in the mesenchyme ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Notably, a few macrophages (largely CD206 – ) already colonized the neuroepithelium. At E12.5 and E14.5, CD206 + macrophages mainly resided in the developing choroid plexus and the meninges, representing BAMs ( Figures 4 C and 4D). The few CD206 + macrophages detected in the developing parenchyma were associated with blood vessels (VEGFR2 + cells) likely corresponding to nascent perivascular macrophages. Conversely, most macrophages in the developing parenchyma were CD206 – and positive for P2Y12, which is starting to be expressed at this time point, corresponding to microglia ( Figures 4 C ad 4D). Of note, P2Y12 was only expressed by macrophages in the neuroectoderm consistent with the idea that microglia start acquiring their signature markers once they are exposed to niche-specific signals. Overall, two macrophage populations distinguishable by the expression of CD206 were detected in the yolk sac at E10.5. Similar populations started to seed distinct niches from the same time point onward in the developing brain. CD206 + macrophages were found in the developing mesenchyme and juxtavascular, while CD206 – P2Y12 + macrophages were detected in the developing neuroepithelium. These data suggest an early segregation of brain macrophages giving rise to BAMs and microglia.
The first wave of hematopoiesis termed primitive hematopoiesis is initiated in the yolk sac around E7.0 with the appearance of early EMPs, which give rise to primitive macrophages at E8.5 ( Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015; Hoeffel and Ginhoux, 2015; Kierdorf et al., 2013 19. Gomez Perdiguero, E. ∙ Klapproth, K. ∙ Schulz, C. ...

Microglia emerge from erythromyeloid precursors via Pu.1- and Irf8-dependent pathways Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :273-280 Crossref Scopus (1048) PubMed Google Scholar ). Starting with the development of the bloodstream at E9.5, primitive macrophages migrate into the developing brain and differentiate into microglia ( Ginhoux et al., 2010 17. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ... Fate mapping analysis reveals that adult microglia derive from primitive macrophages Science. 2010; 330 :841-845 Crossref Scopus (3686) PubMed Google Scholar ). At E8.25, a second wave of late EMPs (c-Myb-expressing) is generated in the yolk sac, giving rise to fetal monocytes after seeding the fetal liver at E9.5 ( Hoeffel et al., 2015 26. Hoeffel, G. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Lavin, Y. ... C-Myb(+) erythro-myeloid progenitor-derived fetal monocytes give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages Immunity. 2015; 42 :665-678 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fetal liver monocytes colonize embryonic tissues from E12.5 onward and generate the majority of tissue macrophages, apart from microglia ( Hoeffel et al., 2015 26. Hoeffel, G. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Lavin, Y. ... C-Myb(+) erythro-myeloid progenitor-derived fetal monocytes give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages Immunity. 2015; 42 :665-678 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ). After E8.5, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, which subsequently migrate to the fetal liver where they contribute to definitive hematopoiesis ( Kieusseian et al., 2012; Kumaravelu et al., 2002 33. Kieusseian, A. ∙ Brunet de la Grange, P. ∙ Burlen-Defranoux, O. ... Immature hematopoietic stem cells undergo maturation in the fetal liver Development. 2012; 139 :3521-3530 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar 35. Kumaravelu, P. ∙ Hook, L. ∙ Morrison, A.M. ...

We next analyzed whether the two macrophage populations (CD206 – and CD206 + ) detected at E10.5 arise independently from different embryonic waves or whether there is a developmental continuum with the first population (CD206 – ) giving rise to the later emerging population (CD206 + ).
To determine whether BAMs arise from the first wave of primitive hematopoiesis as microglia or the second wave of late EMPs, we used the tamoxifen-inducible Runx1 CreER R26 YFP fate-mapping mouse model. The runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) is expressed by hematopoietic progenitors and allows the sequential and short-term tagging of early and late EMPs and HSCs by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) injections at E7.0, E8.0, and E8.5, respectively ( Ginhoux et al., 2010; Hoeffel et al., 2015 17. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ... Fate mapping analysis reveals that adult microglia derive from primitive macrophages Science. 2010; 330 :841-845 Crossref Scopus (3686) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Hoeffel, G. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Lavin, Y. ... C-Myb(+) erythro-myeloid progenitor-derived fetal monocytes give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages Immunity. 2015; 42 :665-678 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ). Labeling of early EMPs (E7.0) revealed similar tagging of CD206 + and CD206 – yolk sac macrophages at E10.5 ( Figures 5 A and 5B) and equal recombination in microglia and BAMs (approximately 28%) at E18.5. Monocytes were expectedly not labeled ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Conversely, 4OHT injection at E8.0 labeled monocytes to 40% but less than 18% of BAMs and microglia were YFP + at E18.5, which was even lower upon 4OHT administration at E8.5 ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Collectively, these data suggest that BAMs originate from early EMPs similar to microglia ( Ginhoux et al., 2010 17. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ... Fate mapping analysis reveals that adult microglia derive from primitive macrophages Science. 2010; 330 :841-845 Crossref Scopus (3686) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further demonstrate that BAM development occurred independently of fetal monocytes, we used Ccr2 CreER reporter mice, which allow the fate-mapping of Ly6C hi (CCR2 + ) monocytes as we previously showed for adult BM monocytes ( Croxford et al., 2015 13. Croxford, A.L. ∙ Lanzinger, M. ∙ Hartmann, F.J. ... The Cytokine GM-CSF Drives the Inflammatory Signature of CCR2+ Monocytes and Licenses Autoimmunity Immunity. 2015; 43 :502-514 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ccr2 CreER R26 Ai14 embryos were treated with tamoxifen and analyzed at E18.5. While monocyte precursors in the fetal liver were not labeled, fetal liver monocytes were tagged at 40%, and approximately 75% of monocytes in the blood and in tissues (lung and brain) were tdTomato + ( Figures 5 C and 5D; Figure S4 D). However, the labeling of both BAMs and microglia was negligible indicating that CCR2-expressing monocytes do not give rise to BAMs or microglia ( Figures 5 C and 5D). As a control, premature alveolar macrophages, which are known to derive from fetal monocytes ( Guilliams et al., 2013; Hoeffel et al., 2015; Schneider et al., 2014 21. Guilliams, M. ∙ De Kleer, I. ∙ Henri, S. ... Alveolar macrophages develop from fetal monocytes that differentiate into long-lived cells in the first week of life via GM-CSF J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210 :1977-1992 Crossref Scopus (883) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Hoeffel, G. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Lavin, Y. ... C-Myb(+) erythro-myeloid progenitor-derived fetal monocytes give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages Immunity. 2015; 42 :665-678 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Schneider, C. ∙ Nobs, S.P. ∙ Kurrer, M. ... Induction of the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ by the cytokine GM-CSF is critical for the differentiation of fetal monocytes into alveolar macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :1026-1037 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ), were tagged at approximately 90% ( Figure S4 D).
In addition, to exclude contribution from definitive hematopoiesis to the BAM population, we used the Cdh5 CreER R26 Ai14 model. This model allows the labeling of the hemogenic endothelium from which the hematopoietic progenitors bud to tag either primitive hematopoiesis in the yolk sac (4OHT treatment at E6.5) or definitive hematopoiesis in the AGM (4OHT treatment at E10.5) ( Gentek et al., 2018 16. Gentek, R. ∙ Ghigo, C. ∙ Hoeffel, G. ... Hemogenic Endothelial Fate Mapping Reveals Dual Developmental Origin of Mast Cells Immunity. 2018; 48 :1160-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). 4OHT treatment at E6.5 in Cdh5 CreER R26 Ai14 mice labeled both populations at approximately 90%, while late targeting (E10.5) led to marginal recombination in brain macrophages ( Figures 5 E and 5F). These data support that BAMs like microglia derive from primitive hematopoiesis.
Last, we used Cx3cr1 CreER R26 Ai14 fate-mapping mice tagging primitive macrophages (CX3CR1 + ), which were treated with tamoxifen at E9.0 to label CD206 – yolk sac macrophages prior to the appearance of CD206 + macrophages ( Figures S4 E–S4H). At E10.5 and E11.5, both macrophage populations in the brain were labeled to a similar extent ( Figure S4 F) suggesting that the CD206 – population differentiates into the CD206 + one. However, at later time points, microglia remained equally labeled, whereas the percentage of fate-mapped BAMs decreased significantly from E14.5 onward ( Figures S4 F–S4H). Also by immunohistochemistry (IHC), virtually all Iba1 + cells in the parenchyma and in perivascular spaces were tdTomato + at E18.5 (tamoxifen at E9.0). In contrast, only 76% of meningeal and 45% of choroid plexus macrophages were labeled at E18.5 suggesting that BAMs in these regions were complemented by unlabeled precursors ( Figures S4 G and S4H). Similar results were obtained with different reporter strains ( R26 RFP and R26 YFP ) (data not shown).
Altogether these data demonstrate that BAMs derive from early EMPs similar to microglia without contribution from fetal liver monocytes or definitive hematopoiesis. Yet, primitive macrophages generated from early EMPs after E9.0 (not tagged in the Cx3cr1 CreER fate-mapping) appear to complement embryonic meningeal and choroid plexus macrophages.
It was previously suggested that TGF-β is important for the development of microglia ( Butovsky et al., 2014 9. Butovsky, O. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ∙ Moore, C.S. ... Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :131-143 Crossref Scopus (1831) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, a model was used where mice lacked TGF-β largely in the CNS. However, TGF-β has pleiotropic functions in the developing CNS for vascular and neuronal development ( Arnold et al., 2014; Brionne et al., 2003; Palazuelos et al., 2014; Yi et al., 2010 3.

Palazuelos, J. ∙ Klingener, M. ∙ Aguirre, A. TGFβ signaling regulates the timing of CNS myelination by modulating oligodendrocyte progenitor cell cycle exit through SMAD3/4/FoxO1/Sp1 J.

TGF-beta signaling specifies axons during brain development Cell. 2010; 142 :144-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ), and global deletion of TGF-β in the brain could also have an indirect effect on microglia development. Moreover, whether TGF-βR signaling also dictates the development of BAMs is unclear. BAMs and microglia equally express Tgfbr2 , but microglia express higher levels of Tgfbr1 ( Figure 3 B). To directly assess the cell-intrinsic role of TGF-βR signaling for CNS macrophage development, we used Vav1 iCre Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice ( Figure 6 ). In these mice, Tgfbr2 is deleted in all hematopoietic cells, which express Vav1 as early as E11.5 ( Chen et al., 2009 11. Chen, M.J. ∙ Yokomizo, T. ∙ Zeigler, B.M. ... Runx1 is required for the endothelial to haematopoietic cell transition but not thereafter Nature. 2009; 457 :887-891 Crossref Scopus (807) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of microglia was reduced in Vav1 iCre Tgfbr2 fl/fl brains throughout development ( Figures 6 A–6F; Figures S5 A–S5C). In contrast, BAMs were essentially unaffected even though both populations showed efficient recombination in the Tgfbr2 locus at E14.5 (data not shown). The decrease in microglia was also evident by IHC in Vav1 iCre Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice at E18.5 and P5 ( Figures 6 E and 6F; Figures S5 A–S5C). Remaining microglia displayed an ameboid morphology characteristic for reactive or immature microglia ( Wolf et al., 2017 67. Wolf, S.A. ∙ Boddeke, H.W. ∙ Kettenmann, H. Microglia in Physiology and Disease Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79 :619-643 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar ) and displayed an altered phenotype ( Figures 6 A–6F) as shown by higher expression of CD45 and F4/80 and upregulation of some of the BAM markers including TIM-4, CD204, and CD206 ( Figures 6 C and 6D) and downregulation of signature genes (such as P2Y12) ( Figure 6 F). Other characteristic genes for BAMs such as Folr2, CD200R, and Lyve1 were not expressed in Tgfbr2- deficient microglia, which enabled the clear distinction between BAMs and microglia in these mice ( Figures 6 C and 6D). In addition, microglia of Vav1 iCre Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice were less proliferative as assessed by Ki67 staining ( Figure S5 C), while no difference was found in BAMs. BAMs did not change their phenotype and were also present at normal numbers in Vav1 iCre Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice ( Figures 6 B and 6E). Moreover, BAMs (Lyve1 + Iba1 + ) were not detected in the parenchyma indicating that they do not seed the parenchyma to replace microglia ( Figure 6 E).
To assess at which developmental stage TGF-βR signaling is important for microglia, we used Cx3cr1 CreER Tgfbr2 fl/fl embryos and neonates, in which Tgfbr2 can be deleted at different time points in BAMs and microglia in an inducible manner upon tamoxifen treatment. We also found fewer and less proliferative microglia with a pro-inflammatory phenotype at the embryonic time points E14.5 (treated with tamoxifen at E10.5 and E12.5) and E18.5 (treated with tamoxifen at E14.5 and E16.5) ( Figures S5 D–S5G). In addition, the microglial signature marker Sall1 was downregulated upon deletion of Tgfbr2 in microglia ( Figure S5 F). We did not find more pro-apoptotic (Annexin V + ) microglia in Tgfbr2 −/− microglia ( Figure S5 G). These findings were supported by cleaved caspase-3 staining in Cx3cr1 CreER Tgfbr2 fl/fl embryos (tamoxifen treatment at E14.5 and E16.5), where virtually no apoptotic microglia were detected upon loss of Tgfbr2 signaling ( Figure S5 H). BAMs at E14.5 were slightly less proliferative, which had, however, no significant impact on their numbers ( Figure S5 G). Tgfbr2 deletion postnatally did not result in fewer microglia but similarly changed their phenotype as previously shown for adult microglia ( Figure S5 D–S5F) ( Buttgereit et al., 2016 10. Buttgereit, A. ∙ Lelios, I. ∙ Yu, X. ... Sall1 is a transcriptional regulator defining microglia identity and function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1397-1406 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To directly assess the role of TGF-β for microglial proliferation, differentiation or survival, microglia derived from E18.5 WT brains were exposed to TGF-β and CSF-1. In cultures exposed to TGF-β but in the absence of CSF-1, no viable microglia were detected indicating that CSF-1 is needed for microglia survival as shown previously ( Bohlen et al., 2017; Butovsky et al., 2014 6. Bohlen, C.J. ∙ Bennett, F.C. ∙ Tucker, A.F. ... Diverse Requirements for Microglial Survival, Specification, and Function Revealed by Defined-Medium Cultures Neuron. 2017; 94 :759-773 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar 9. Butovsky, O. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ∙ Moore, C.S. ... Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :131-143 Crossref Scopus (1831) PubMed Google Scholar ), while TGF-β alone is not sufficient (data not shown). The addition of TGF-β resulted in increased microglial proliferation, acquisition of a more ramified morphology and upregulation of microglial signature genes including P2ry12 and Sall3 , whereas Sall1 was slightly but not significantly upregulated ( Figures S6 A and S6B). No difference in apoptosis was found in CSF-1 cultures compared to cells exposed to CSF-1 and TGF-β as assessed by expression of P uma , B im , and B ax and staining for cleaved Caspase-3 ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Altogether, these data suggest that TGF-β controls the differentiation including expression of microglia signature genes and expansion of microglia in the embryonic brain.
Whereas the Vav1 i Cre and the Cx3cr1 CreER strains lead to recombination across all brain macrophages, we wished to confirm our findings by independently targeting Tgfbr2 in committed BAMs and microglia. We previously showed that adult microglia can be efficiently targeted using Sall1 CreER mice ( Buttgereit et al., 2016 10. Buttgereit, A. ∙ Lelios, I. ∙ Yu, X. ... Sall1 is a transcriptional regulator defining microglia identity and function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1397-1406 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to adult mice, we found that this strain was also useful for targeting microglia in the embryo while sparing BAMs, reinforcing the distinct features of these cell populations ( Figures 7 A–7D; Figure S6 C). Again, we observed a phenotypic shift of microglia in Sall1 CreER Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice including upregulation of F4/80, CD204, and CD206 and downregulation of P2ry12 , CX3CR1, and CD11b ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and 7E). We further crossed the Sall1 CreER Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice to R26 RFP mice, which allows the deletion of Tgfbr2 and simultaneous labeling of Sall1 -expressing microglia upon tamoxifen injection (E14.5 and E16.5). At E18.5, the number of RFP + microglia was significantly reduced upon loss of Tgfbr 2 ( Figure 7 D). Successful and specific deletion of Tgfbr2 was verified by qPCR ( Figure 7 E). Alongside, we noted fewer proliferative (Ki67 + ) microglia with elevated amoeboid morphology in Sall1 CreER Tgfbr2 fl/fl embryos ( Figures 7 F–7H). Also here, Tgfbr2 -deficient microglia expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines ( Figure 7 E), similarly to what we described for adult microglia upon deletion of Tgfbr2 ( Buttgereit et al., 2016 10. Buttgereit, A. ∙ Lelios, I. ∙ Yu, X. ... Sall1 is a transcriptional regulator defining microglia identity and function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1397-1406 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, deletion of Tgfbr2 in Sall1-expressing microglia results in their activation concomitant with a phenotypic shift and cell loss.
To further confirm that BAMs develop independently of TGF-βR signaling, we sought for a tool to target BAMs while sparing microglia. In adulthood, we found Siglec1 to be expressed by BAMs ( Mrdjen et al., 2018 47. Mrdjen, D. ∙ Pavlovic, A. ∙ Hartmann, F.J. ... High-Dimensional Single-Cell Mapping of Central Nervous System Immune Cells Reveals Distinct Myeloid Subsets in Health, Aging, and Disease Immunity. 2018; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (563) Google Scholar ). During embryogenesis, 60% of BAMs expressed Siglec1 at E14.5 (data not shown), and virtually all BAMs expressed Siglec1 by E18.5, while microglia were negative for it ( Figures S7 A and S7B). We next analyzed Siglec1 Cre Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice, in which Tgfbr2 is deleted in Siglec1 + macrophages (i.e., BAMs). At E18.5, no changes in total cell numbers, cell-surface marker expression or mRNA levels of Il1b and Tnf were found in Tgfbr2 -deficient BAMs ( Figures 7 I–7L; Figure S7 C). Specific deletion of Tgfbr2 in BAMs in Siglec1 Cre Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice was confirmed by qRT-PCR ( Figure 7 K). Microglia, which were not targeted in these mice, were not affected ( Figures 7 I–7L). These data suggest that TGF-βR signaling is not required for the development or maintenance of BAMs but controls microglia accumulation and differentiation.

Over the past years, several reports on single-cell analyses of CNS macrophages have revealed their regional heterogeneity and diversity ( Hammond et al., 2019; Jordão et al., 2019; Masuda et al., 2019; Mrdjen et al., 2018; Van Hove et al., 2019 22.

Van Hove, H. ∙ Martens, L. ∙ Scheyltjens, I. ... A single-cell atlas of mouse brain macrophages reveals unique transcriptional identities shaped by ontogeny and tissue environment Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, BAMs represent a separate entity of brain phagocytes, which are most likely shaped by both location and ontogeny. Here, we wanted to assess whether brain macrophage lineage commitment is determined already in the developing brain and define the signals governing their differentiation. We studied the emergence, distribution, and development of brain macrophages in a high-dimensional and spatiotemporal manner during embryogenesis. We found diversification of two separate primitive macrophage populations (CD206 – versus CD206 + ) as early as E10.5 in the yolk sac and the brain. Different fate-mapping models revealed that both populations arise from early EMPs and that fetal monocytes or definitive hematopoiesis do not contribute to the pool of BAMs and microglia in development. Our data further suggest that CD206 – macrophages differentiate into CD206 + macrophages. It is unclear whether the appearance of CD206 + macrophages is restricted to the yolk sac, leading to the sequential colonization of the brain by CD206 – macrophages at E9.5 and CD206 + macrophages at E10.5. Conversely, the differentiation of CD206 – into CD206 + macrophages might occur across all embryonic tissues including the brain as a pre-defined differentiation pathway. Mass et al. described a core macrophage transcriptional program including the upregulation of Mrc1 (CD206), which is initiated once the primitive macrophages seed embryonic tissues from E9.5 ( Mass et al., 2016 44. Mass, E. ∙ Ballesteros, I. ∙ Farlik, M. ... Specification of tissue-resident macrophages during organogenesis Science. 2016; 353 :353 Crossref Scopus (583) PubMed Google Scholar ). This transcriptional signature is subsequently adjusted in response to tissue-specific signals by for instance loss of CD206 expression. This was also suggested to occur in developing microglia ( Mass et al., 2016 44. Mass, E. ∙ Ballesteros, I. ∙ Farlik, M. ... Specification of tissue-resident macrophages during organogenesis Science. 2016; 353 :353 Crossref Scopus (583) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, here we postulate that the development of microglia may not involve an intermediate transition through CD206 + macrophages but that embryonic BAMs and microglia are separate populations from the emergence of primitive macrophages in the yolk sac. In the embryonic brain, CD206 served as a useful universal BAM marker to distinguish them from microglia before they start differentiating and expressing other BAM signature genes. Using scRNA-seq, Hammond et al. also identified a transcriptionally distinct microglia population expressing Ms4a7 and Mrc1 in the developing brain, likely accounting for BAMs ( Hammond et al., 2019 22. Hammond, T.R. ∙ Dufort, C. ∙ Dissing-Olesen, L. ... Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Microglia throughout the Mouse Lifespan and in the Injured Brain Reveals Complex Cell-State Changes Immunity. 2019; 50 :253-271 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1184) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Once primitive macrophages have taken up residence in their respective compartments in the developing brain, environmental cues shape their transcriptional specifications. We found characteristic expression of BAM and microglia markers from E12.5 onward. In addition to the molecular signature, we also observed changes in their morphology upon seeding their niche. Microglia acquired a characteristic ramified appearance, while BAMs retained an amoeboid shape throughout development. These findings support the idea that the molecular signature described for adult BAMs ( Jordão et al., 2019; Van Hove et al., 2019 28. Jordão, M.J.C. ∙ Sankowski, R. ∙ Brendecke, S.M. ... Single-cell profiling identifies myeloid cell subsets with distinct fates during neuroinflammation Science. 2019; 363 :363 Crossref Scopus (531) Google Scholar 63. Van Hove, H. ∙ Martens, L. ∙ Scheyltjens, I. ... A single-cell atlas of mouse brain macrophages reveals unique transcriptional identities shaped by ontogeny and tissue environment Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ) is already imprinted in embryonic BAMs. Embryonic BAMs displayed a homogeneous gene signature (CD206 + Lyve1 + MHCII – Folr2 + ), whereas in adult BAMs these markers accounted for most of their heterogeneity ( Jordão et al., 2019; Mrdjen et al., 2018; Van Hove et al., 2019 28. Jordão, M.J.C. ∙ Sankowski, R. ∙ Brendecke, S.M. ... Single-cell profiling identifies myeloid cell subsets with distinct fates during neuroinflammation Science. 2019; 363 :363 Crossref Scopus (531) Google Scholar 47. Mrdjen, D. ∙ Pavlovic, A. ∙ Hartmann, F.J. ...

Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). The homogeneous embryonic BAM population, which we identified resembles leptomeningeal BAMs in the Van Hove study. This might be brought about by extrinsic environmental stimuli, changes in regional factors or the microbiota, which could influence the transcriptome of BAMs postnatally similar to what has been described for microglia ( Erny et al., 2015; Hammond et al., 2019; Thion et al., 2018 15. Erny, D. ∙ Hrabě de Angelis, A.L. ∙ Jaitin, D. ... Host microbiota constantly control maturation and function of microglia in the CNS Nat.

Microbiome Influences Prenatal and Adult Microglia in a Sex-Specific Manner Cell. 2018; 172 :500-516 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most likely, the heterogeneity described in adult BAMs is further generated by monocytes contributing to dural and choroid plexus BAMs.
Regarding BAMs, the local factors regulating their development and homeostasis have so far not been elucidated. In adult mice, the maintenance of brain macrophages depends on CSF-1R signaling ( Buttgereit et al., 2016; Mrdjen et al., 2018; Van Hove et al., 2019 10. Buttgereit, A. ∙ Lelios, I. ∙ Yu, X. ... Sall1 is a transcriptional regulator defining microglia identity and function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1397-1406 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar 47.

Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1021-1035 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ); whether BAMs also require it for their development similar to microglia is not clear ( Ginhoux et al., 2010 17. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ... Fate mapping analysis reveals that adult microglia derive from primitive macrophages Science. 2010; 330 :841-845 Crossref Scopus (3686) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another cytokine previously suggested to control microglia development is TGF-β ( Butovsky et al., 2014 9. Butovsky, O. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ∙ Moore, C.S. ... Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :131-143 Crossref Scopus (1831) PubMed Google Scholar ). We analyzed the role of intrinsic TGF-βR signaling in developing BAMs and microglia. Deletion of TGF-βR signaling in microglia led to loss of their identity and reduced numbers. Postnatally and in adult mice, TGF-βR acted as a homeostatic checkpoint for microglia but did not influence microglial survival as described previously ( Buttgereit et al., 2016; Lund et al., 2018; Zöller et al., 2018 10. Buttgereit, A. ∙ Lelios, I. ∙ Yu, X. ... Sall1 is a transcriptional regulator defining microglia identity and function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1397-1406 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Lund, H. ∙ Pieber, M. ∙ Parsa, R. ... Fatal demyelinating disease is induced by monocyte-derived macrophages in the absence of TGF-β signaling Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Zöller, T. ∙ Schneider, A. ∙ Kleimeyer, C. ... Silencing of TGFβ signalling in microglia results in impaired homeostasis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4011 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the embryo, however, TGF-βR signaling is required for microglia differentiation and proliferation, in agreement with what was described by others ( Arnold et al., 2019 4. Arnold, T.D. ∙ Lizama, C.O. ∙ Cautivo, K.M. ... Impaired αVβ8 and TGFβ signaling lead to microglial dysmaturation and neuromotor dysfunction J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :900-915 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, in contrast to microglia, TGF-β was not a prerequisite for the development of BAMs, which further emphasizes the existence of two independent developmental pathways for brain macrophages modulated by tissue-derived signals. The factors that regulate TGF-β signaling and whether, for example, an inflammatory stimulus during pregnancy could influence microglia development in a TGF-β-dependent manner remain to be shown. In the lipopolysaccharide-induced model of maternal immune activation ( Squarzoni et al., 2014 59. Squarzoni, P. ∙ Oller, G. ∙ Hoeffel, G. ... Microglia modulate wiring of the embryonic forebrain Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :1271-1279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (488) PubMed Google Scholar ), neither the expression of TGF-β in the brain nor microglia development were altered (data not shown). In addition, the cellular source of TGF-β critical for microglia development is unclear, but published RNA-seq data suggest that microglia, BAMs, and endothelial cells express Tgfb1 ( Saunders et al., 2018; Vanlandewijck et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014 53. Saunders, A. ∙ Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Wysoker, A. ... Molecular Diversity and Specializations among the Cells of the Adult Mouse Brain Cell. 2018; 174 :1015-1030 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (921) PubMed Google Scholar 64.

Zhang, Y. ∙ Chen, K. ∙ Sloan, S.A. ... An RNA-sequencing transcriptome and splicing database of glia, neurons, and vascular cells of the cerebral cortex J. Neurosci. 2014; 34 :11929-11947 Crossref Scopus (3463) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether microglia sense TGF-β in an autocrine manner remains to be shown.
In adult mice, depletion of microglia is rapidly overcome by replenishing the empty niche by either remaining microglia themselves or by blood-borne precursors ( Waisman et al., 2015 65. Waisman, A. ∙ Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ... Homeostasis of Microglia in the Adult Brain: Review of Novel Microglia Depletion Systems Trends Immunol. 2015; 36 :625-636 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, in Nrros −/− mice, which lack a myeloid-expressed transmembrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, impaired microglia development led to the emergence of “perivascular macrophage-like cells” ( Wong et al., 2017 68. Wong, K. ∙ Noubade, R. ∙ Manzanillo, P. ... Mice deficient in NRROS show abnormal microglial development and neurological disorders Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :633-641 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, upon deletion of Tgfbr2 in embryonic microglia, we did not observe an accumulation of monocytes in the brain or their differentiation into microglia suggesting that monocytes do not compensate for the loss of microglia (data not shown). Additionally, TGF-βR-sufficient BAMs did not invade the empty microglia niche. Thus, even though BAMs and microglia inhabit the same organ, their developmental trajectory appears to be stable, and we found no evidence of BAM to microglia conversion.
Tissue-resident macrophages exhibit unique gene expression profiles specific to their tissue of residence ( Gosselin et al., 2014; Lavin et al., 2014 20. Gosselin, D. ∙ Link, V.M. ∙ Romanoski, C.E. ...

Tissue-resident macrophage enhancer landscapes are shaped by the local microenvironment Cell. 2014; 159 :1312-1326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1535) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microglia even display distinct gene expression patterns at different stages of development, possibly to support temporal neurodevelopment ( Hammond et al., 2019; Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016 22. Hammond, T.R. ∙ Dufort, C. ∙ Dissing-Olesen, L. ... Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Microglia throughout the Mouse Lifespan and in the Injured Brain Reveals Complex Cell-State Changes Immunity. 2019; 50 :253-271 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1184) PubMed Google Scholar 46.

Microglia development follows a stepwise program to regulate brain homeostasis Science. 2016; 353 :aad8670 Crossref Scopus (808) PubMed Google Scholar ). The functional properties of embryonic BAMs in brain development remain largely elusive but could be associated with antigen presentation and neuronal development. Here, we describe two discrete brain macrophage populations with different developmental programs during embryogenesis. From the moment of their arrival in the brain, BAMs comprise a spatially, transcriptionally, and phenotypically distinct macrophage population separate from parenchymal microglia. With these findings, going forward, we can now interrogate the functional role of BAMs in CNS development, homeostasis, and disease.

All ‘Cre’ and ‘CreER’ strains were used as heterozygotes. All animal experiments performed in this study were approved by the Swiss Veterinary Office. All mice were on a C57BL/6 background and kept in individually ventilated cages under specific-pathogen-free conditions. In general, two to 6 months old mice were used for timed matings and both female and male embryos and neonates were analyzed.
Two to 6 month old mice were mated over night and separated early the next morning. The morning after the mating was considered E0.5.
Tamoxifen or hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) was reconstituted in corn oil with a final concentration of 25 mg/ml. 5 mg were administered via oral gavage (o.g.) to pregnant mice.
Embryonic microglia (CD45 + Ly6G − Ly6C − CD206 − CX3CR1 + ) were sorted from fetal brains (E18.5) and 10,000 cells per well were cultured for 24 hours in 96-well plates in complete microglia medium (DMEM medium, supplemented with 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 1x GlutaMAX, 5% FCS, 1% Pen/Strep, 50 μM β-Mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 and 20 ng/ml CSF-1 or 20 ng/ml CSF-1 alone). Cells were then washed and further stained with anti-mouse CX3CR1 (ms), anti-mouse cCaspase3 (rb) and anti-mouse F4/80 (rat) for histological analysis or processed for RNA isolation.
Mice were sacrificed by CO 2 inhalation and trans-cardiac perfusions were performed with ice-cold PBS. Embryos were removed from the uterus of the pregnant mice and the brain was harvested including the meninges (pia and dura) and the choroid plexus. Yolk sacs were isolated by gently isolating the uterine horns, removing the placenta and the parietal yolk sac to uncover the visceral yolk sac. The samples were cut into small pieces and digested with 0.4 mg/ml Collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mg/ml DNase in HBSS (with Ca2 + /Mg2 + ) supplemented with 5% FBS and 2 mM HEPES for 20 minutes at 37°C, shaking. The samples were washed with ice-cold PBS, filtered and were then ready for staining with fluorescence cytometry antibodies.
Cells were incubated with anti-mouse CD16/32 in PBS for 15 minutes to block the Fc receptor. Cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in the desired antibody mix in PBS and stained for 20 min at 4°C. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3 transcription factor staining buffer kit (Thermo Fisher) for intra-cellular and intra-nuclear staining and washed two times with PermWash (0.01% sodium azide, 0.5% saponin and 2% BSA in PBS). Cells were then resuspended in FACS buffer (2 mM EDTA, 2% FCS in PBS) and analyzed. Flow cytometry was performed using an LSRII Fortessa or a FACSymphony A5 (Becton Dickinson/BD Biosciences) and analyzed with the FlowJo software (Tree Star) and R studio. Cell sorting was performed using a FACSAria III. Fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for mouse I-A/I-E (clone M5/114.15.2), CD11b (clone M1/70), CD11c (clone N418), CD45 (clone 30-F11), Ly6C (HK1.4), Ly6G (clone 1A8), CD64 (clone X54-5/7.1), F4/80 (clone Cl:A3-1), CD169 (clone SER-4), CD206 (clone C068C2), Lyve1 (clone ALY7), CD38 (clone 90), CX3CR1 (clone SA011F11), Gr-1 (clone RB6-8C5), IRF4 (clone IRF4.3E4), IRF8 (clone V3GYWCH), Ki67 (clone SOLA15), F4/80 (clone BM8), CD49d (clone R1-2), MerTK (clone DS5MMER), PU.1 (clone 7C2C34), c-MAF (clone T54-853), Folr2 (clone 10/FR2), CD301b (clone URA-1) and Tim-4 (clone F31-5G3) were purchased either from BD Biosciences, eBioscience, AbD Serotec or Biolegend. Dead cells and duplets were excluded for analysis using SSC-A/H, FSC-A/H and a Fixable Viability Kit (Near-IR staining, Biolegend).
Brains from mouse embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3 hours (E10.5, E12.5) or overnight (E14.5, E18.5, P2, and P5) at 4°C. Brains were rinsed with PBS followed by cryoprotection with 30% sucrose in PBS for 48 hours at 4°C. Samples were embedded in OCT (Medite). Cryo-sectioning was performed with a thickness of 20-50 μm (on slide or free floating) using a Hyrax C60 cryostat (Zeiss). Brain sections were permeabilized by incubation in blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 hour at room temperature. Free-floating sections were labeled with primary antibodies at 4°C over night in staining solution (PBS supplemented with 2% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100) using anti-Iba1 (1:500), anti-GFP (1:500), anti-Lyve1 (1:200), anti-Ki67 (1:500), anti-mouse F4/80 (1:200), anti-rabbit cCaspase3 (1:200) and anti-Collagen IV (1:500). After washing, samples were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with the respective secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, anti-rat, streptavidin, etc., 1:700). Washing was repeated and sections were mounted with 1 drop of DAPI mounting medium (Dianova). For semi-automated quantification ( Figure S6 ) fluorophore-labeled sections were acquired on a Vectra3 (Perkin Elmer) fluorescence microscope using a 20x objective lens. Filters for AF488, AF546, AF555, AF647, AF660 and DAPI were used for imaging tissues to facilitate subsequent unmixing of all colors according to their respective spectra. High-resolution images were taken at the SP8 upright (Leica) with a 20x emulsion objective with 1024x1024 pixels. Images were taken in frames with a line average of 16 or 32. DAPI and AF546/AF555 were detected in 1 sequence and AF488 and AF647/AF660 were detected in a second sequence to avoid spill. Images were processed and merged by Imaris Imaging software (Bitplane).
Alternatively, following PFA fixation, brains were washed in PBS and embedded in 3% agarose ( Figure 5 ). Immunohistochemistry was performed on 80 μm thick free-floating vibratome sections. Brain sections were permeabilized by incubation in blocking solution (PBS containing 0.2% gelatin and 0.25% Triton X-100) for 2 hours, and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies using anti-chicken GFP (1:500), anti-CD206 (1:200), anti-rabbit P2Y12 (1:500), anti-goat VEGFR2 (1:50). Sections were rinsed twice in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100, followed by several PBS washes, before overnight incubation with secondary antibodies (1:400 in PBS). Hoechst (1:1000) was used for fluorescent nuclear counterstaining. Images were acquired with the Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope at 10x.
Raw data was pre-processed using FlowJo followed by transformation in MATLAB using cyt2, percentile normalization in R obtaining values between 0 and 1, dimensionality reduction and visualization by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) ( Mair et al., 2016; Mrdjen et al., 2018 43. Mair, F. ∙ Hartmann, F.J. ∙ Mrdjen, D. ... The end of gating? An introduction to automated analysis of high dimensional cytometry data Eur. J.

High-Dimensional Single-Cell Mapping of Central Nervous System Immune Cells Reveals Distinct Myeloid Subsets in Health, Aging, and Disease Immunity. 2018; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (563) Google Scholar ). The FlowSOM algorithm was used for automated clustering ( Van Gassen et al., 2015 62. Van Gassen, S. ∙ Callebaut, B. ∙ Van Helden, M.J. ... FlowSOM: Using self-organizing maps for visualization and interpretation of cytometry data Cytometry A. 2015; 87 :636-645 Crossref Scopus (1077) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the t-SNE map or UMAP with overlaid mean marker expression values and a heatmap of median expression values ( Hartmann et al., 2016; Mrdjen et al., 2018 24. Hartmann, F.J. ∙ Bernard-Valnet, R. ∙ Quériault, C. ... High-dimensional single-cell analysis reveals the immune signature of narcolepsy J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :2621-2633 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar 47. Mrdjen, D. ∙ Pavlovic, A. ∙ Hartmann, F.J. ... High-Dimensional Single-Cell Mapping of Central Nervous System Immune Cells Reveals Distinct Myeloid Subsets in Health, Aging, and Disease Immunity. 2018; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (563) Google Scholar ). Individual cluster frequencies were computed in the R environment for each cluster, exported into an excel file, and used for further downstream analysis.
Single cell suspensions of CD45 + F4/80 + CD11b + Ly6C - cells derived from WT brains at E16.5 (300–500 cells/μL) were mixed (3:2 ratio) with C1 Cell Suspension Reagent (Fluidigm) and loaded onto a 5-10 μm-diameter C1 Integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC; Fluidigm). LIVE/DEAD stain (2.5 μL ethidium homodimer-1 and 0.625 μL calcein AM (Life Technologies)) was re-suspended in 1.25 mL C1 Cell Wash Buffer (Fluidigm) and 20 μL was loaded onto the C1 IFC for staining. After cells were captured on the chip, they were imaged using phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy before cell lysis. Cell lysis, reverse transcription and cDNA amplification were performed on the C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep IFC, as specified by the manufacturer (Fluidigm Inc. protocol no. 100-5950 B1). The SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit (Clontech) was used for cDNA synthesis from the single cells. The resulting cDNA was quantified with a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (PN P11496; Life Technologies), and quality was checked with High Sensitivity DNA Reagents (PN 5067-4626) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies). Only cells with high-quality cDNA and concentration higher than 0.05 ng/μl were processed for subsequent library preparation. Illumina NGS library was constructed with Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (protocol 100-7168 E1). Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina) high output mode by multiplexed single-read run with 51 cycles.
The BCL files of raw sequence data were converted to FASTQ format via Illumina Casava 1.8.2. Reads were de-multiplexed according to their barcodes and quality evaluated using FastQC. Reads were mapped to the reference genome (hg19) allowing 1 mismatch.
Total RNA was extracted from F4/80 hi (CD45 + F4/80 hi CD11b + Ly6C - Ly6G - ) and CD11b hi (CD45 + F4/80 + CD11b hi Ly6C - Ly6G - ) cells derived from WT brains using Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation kit (Applied Biosystems Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturers’ protocol and was analyzed on Agilent Bioanalyser for quality assessment with median RNA Integrity Number of RIN 7.7. cDNA libraries were prepared using 2 ng of total RNA and 1ul of a 1:50,000 dilution of ERCC RNA Spike in Controls (Ambion® Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the SMARTSeq v2 protocol ( Picelli et al., 2014 50. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, A.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (2539) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following modifications: 1. Addition of 20 μM TSO; 2. Use of 200 pg cDNA with 1/5 reaction of Illumina Nextera XT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The length distribution of the cDNA libraries was monitored using a DNA High Sensitivity Reagent Kit on the Perkin Elmer Labchip (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). All samples were subjected to an indexed paired-end sequencing run of 2x151 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 system (Illumina) (31 samples/lane). Raw reads were aligned to mouse genome build GRCm38 using STAR aligner. Read counts per gene were calculated using the featureCounts (part of the Subread package) based on GENCODE gene annotation version M16. R8171 sample was removed as the library yield was very low. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the logarithmically transformed expression values using the function prcomp in the R Statistical Language ( https://www.R-project.org/ ). Genes that were differentially expressed between cell types and developmental stages were identified using edgeR packages ( Robinson et al., 2010 51. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26703) PubMed Google Scholar ). DEGs with FDR (False Discovery Rate) less than 0.05 were divided into 5 distinct groups by hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage was performed using Euclidean distance on logarithmically transformed expression values. Biological functions significantly enriched in each cluster were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Pathway regulation in IPA were determined using the log fold changes from the comparison between E18.5 and E10.5.
Total RNA was isolated from FACS sorted cells using the RNeasy micro plus kit (QIAGEN) or QuickRNA Microprep Kit (Zymo Research). cDNA was synthesized with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and qRT-PCR was performed on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System(Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). Primers used in this paper are listed in Table S1 .
Statistical analysis including mean values, SEM values and p values was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance between two groups was evaluated by Two-tailed unpaired t test. Welsh ʼ s correction was applied in case of significantly different variances. For more than two goups one-way ANOVA with Dunnett or Bonferroni post test was performed. P values blow 0.05 were considered significantly different ( ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001; ns, not significant). Mean (±SEM) was indicated with horizontal lines. N represents number of biological replicates unless otherwise stated. Statistical details for each experiment can be found in the corresponding figure legends.
The scRNA-seq and the bulk RNA-seq datasets are deposited in the Genome Expression Omnibus under the accession numbers GEO: GSE146926 and GEO: GSE146928 , respectively.
