Title: A plant immune protein enables broad antitumor response by rescuing microRNA deficiency


Abstract: Summary

Cancer cells are featured with uncontrollable activation of cell cycle, and microRNA deficiency drives tumorigenesis. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) is essential for small-RNA-mediated immune response in plants but is absent in vertebrates. Here, we show that ectopic expression of plant RDR1 can generally inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In many human primary tumors, abnormal microRNA isoforms with 1-nt-shorter 3′ ends are widely accumulated. RDR1 with nucleotidyltransferase activity can recognize and modify the problematic AGO2-free microRNA duplexes with mononucleotides to restore their 2 nt overhang structure, which eventually rescues AGO2-loading efficiency and elevates global miRNA expression to inhibit cancer cell-cycle specifically. The broad antitumor effects of RDR1, which can be delivered by an adeno-associated virus, are visualized in multiple xenograft tumor models in vivo . Altogether, we reveal the widespread accumulation of aberrant microRNA isoforms in tumors and develop a plant RDR1-mediated antitumor stratagem by editing and repairing defective microRNAs.

Section: Introduction

Aberrant activation of cell cycle and proliferation is indispensable for tumorigenesis ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011 24. Hanahan, D. ∙ Weinberg, R.A.

Cell cycle proteins as promising targets in cancer therapy Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2017; 17 :93-115 Crossref Scopus (1372) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cell cycle is well-organized and precisely regulated by complexes containing cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and checkpoint proteins in normal tissues. The dysregulation of upstream mitogenic signaling pathways and direct mutations of cell-cycle genes cause unscheduled overactivation of cell cycle, which eventually result in tumorigenesis ( Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009 40.

Although cell-cycle inhibitors have been developed, the related toxicological effects and drug resistance are still huge challenges for clinical applications ( Suski et al., 2021 54.

RNA interference (RNAi) refers to a type of small RNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation ( Bernstein et al., 2001 4. Bernstein, E. ∙ Caudy, A.A. ∙ Hammond, S.M. ...

Small RNAs mainly include microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNA (siRNAs). In mammals, primary miRNAs (pri-miRNA) with stem-loop structures are cleaved twice by DROSHA/DGCR8 complex, followed by DICER (ribonuclease III) protein, and generate mature miRNA duplexes with 2 nt 3′ end overhang, which are then recognized by and loaded into Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form functional RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) ( Bartel, 2018 3.

miRNAs are indispensable for various physiological activities, and many miRNAs are known to target and suppress cell-cycle genes to directly control cell proliferation ( Bueno and Malumbres, 2011 8.

However, the universal features of miRNA isoforms in primary tumors and cancer cells have not been systematically characterized, which is crucial to mechanically understand miRNA deficiency in different cancers.
Different from miRNAs, siRNAs are derived from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates that are synthesized by different RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs). RDRs have been identified in almost all eukaryotes but are lost in vertebrates with cell-based secondary immune systems during evolution ( Zong et al., 2009 63. Zong, J. ∙ Yao, X. ∙ Yin, J. ...

In plants, RDR1-dependent siRNAs especially participate in antiviral immune response ( Cao et al., 2014 9. Cao, M. ∙ Du, P. ∙ Wang, X. ...

Small RNAs in transcriptional gene silencing and genome defence Nature. 2009; 457 :413-420 Crossref Scopus (659) PubMed Google Scholar ). In recent years, cross-species bioengineering has been successfully applied in basic research and translational medicine, such as CRISPR-Cas from bacteria ( Cong et al., 2013 10.

Ther. 2021; 29 :571-586 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore propose to perform plant RDR1-based bioengineering in mammals and to further investigate its potential translational medicine applications.
In this study, we successfully expressed RDR1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and Oryza sativa (Os) in mammalian cells, which profoundly inhibited cell proliferation of all 10 different cancer cell lines tested but had not affected 5 non-cancer cell lines. Interestingly, we found that plant RDR1 can globally increase miRNA expression in different cancer cells and that miRNA pathway is indispensable for RDR1 to target cell-cycle genes and repress cancer cell proliferation. Unexpectedly, we found that abnormal miRNA isoforms with 1-nt-shorter 3′ ends, which are poorly associated with AGO2, are widely accumulated in many different primary tumors and cancer cell lines, but not in healthy tissues. Plant RDR1 with nucleotidyltransferase activity is able to recognize and modify such AGO2-free miRNA duplex isoforms with mononucleotides to restore the regular 2 nt overhang structure of miRNA duplexes and elevate their loading efficiency into AGO2, which eventually increases global miRNA expression and re-activates the deficient miRNA pathway in cancer cells. By contrast, loss of the nucleotidyltransferase activity eliminates the effects of RDR1 on miRNA expression, cell-cycle repression, and tumor growth inhibition. In different xenograft tumor models, we prove that RDR1 dramatically inhibits growth of both solid and blood cancers in vivo . Finally, through nanoparticles and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), we realized RDR1 delivery in cancer cell lines and in xenograft model, respectively. In summary, our study uncovers abnormal accumulation of 1-nt-shorter miRNA isoforms widely in various human primary tumors, which provides insights into understanding the global miRNA dosage reduction during tumorigenesis. Using plant immune protein RDR1, we build a broad antitumor reaction by rescuing miRNA deficiency in cancer cells and develop a stratagem to edit and manipulate miRNAs as a powerful weapon to fight against human diseases such as cancer.

Section: Results

To perform plant RDR1-based bioengineering in mammalian cells, we cloned RDR1 genes from At and Os, separately, into lentiviral vectors carrying a co-expressed EGFP gene, which were then used to infect different mammalian cells. Eventually, we obtained 13 stable RDR1-inducible cell lines including 7 solid tumors (A549, HCT116, HepG2, HeLa, H1299, PC-3, and U-2 OS), 3 leukemia (Jurkat, K562 and NALM6) and 3 non-cancer somatic cell lines (NIH/3T3, RPE-1, and WPMY-1), as well as two embryonic stem cell lines (mouse V6.5 and human WIBR3) with consistent RDR1 expression ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). Expression of AtRDR1 and OsRDR1 proteins in all the above cell lines were verified by western blot ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Furthermore, by using the lentiviral vector expressing mCherry-fused OsRDR1 protein, we observed that OsRDR1 protein was clearly localized in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus ( Figure 1 D).
Very surprisingly and unexpectedly, we found that AtRDR1 and OsRDR1 were both able to significantly repress proliferation of all 10 cancer cell lines tested but had no impact on all other 5 non-cancer cells ( Figure 1 E). RDR1 can also dramatically suppress colony formation ability of HCT116, HepG2, and HeLa cells ( Figures 1 F and S1 B). Moreover, wound-healing and cell invasion assays on A549 and H1299 cells suggested that plant RDR1 obviously blocked cancer cell migration and invasion ( Figures S1 C and S1D).
Molecularly, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) suggest that both AtRDR1 and OsRDR1 could commonly inhibit cell-cycle process in all seven cancer cell lines tested but not in any of the non-cancer control cells ( Figures 1 G, 1H, and S1 E; Table S1 ). More than 30 core cell-cycle genes, including CDCs, CDKs, MCMs (minichromosome maintenance complex components), and ORCs (origin recognition complex subunits), were profoundly suppressed by plant RDR1 in cancer cells ( Figure S1 F). Notably, short-time (2–3 days) induction of RDR1 can significantly suppress cell-cycle process and related genes in cancer cells ( Figures 1 E, 1G, 1H, S1 E, and S1F–S1H; Table S1 ), indicating that cell-cycle pathway could be a direct target of RDR1. Western blot further proved that plant RDR1 decreased the expressions of key cell-cycle proteins (including CCND1, CCNE2, CDK6, MCM2, and PLK1) in HeLa, HepG2, H1299, and Jurkat but not in non-cancer RPE-1 and WIBR3 cells ( Figure 1 I). EdU/PI staining assay revealed that RDR1 expression in HCT116, HepG2, and H1299 cells significantly reduced the cell proportion in the S phase and instead increased cells in the G0/G1 phase. As expected, RDR1 did not affect the cell cycle in non-cancer NIH/3T3 cells ( Figure 1 J). Thus, we consider plant immune protein RDR1 as an external tumor suppressor, which is able to generally target and interfere with cell-cycle pathway in cancer, but not in non-cancer cells.
Since RDR1 participates in small RNA pathways in plants ( Borges and Martienssen, 2015 6. Borges, F. ∙ Martienssen, R.A. The expanding world of small RNAs in plants Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 :727-741 Crossref Scopus (692) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cao et al., 2014 9. Cao, M. ∙ Du, P. ∙ Wang, X. ... Virus infection triggers widespread silencing of host genes by a distinct class of endogenous siRNAs in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :14613-14618 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that RDR1 inhibited cell cycle through small RNAs in animals. Small RNA-seq was performed on cancer and non-cancer control cells with or without RDR1 induction. Genome-wide analysis was firstly performed. However, we did not detect any type of siRNAs originating from dsRNAs at coding gene, transposon, noncoding RNA, or other genomic regions ( Table S2 ), showing that plant RDR1 alone might not be able to reconstitute siRNA pathway in animals. Surprisingly, we did find an obvious increase in global miRNA expression in all cancer, but not in non-cancer, cell lines ( Figures 2 A and S2 A; Table S3 ). Using both qRT-PCR analysis and small RNA northern blot, we further confirmed the expressional increase of multiple miRNAs in cancer ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Furthermore, by treating HeLa cells with a cell-cycle inhibitor, palbociclib, we found that cell-cycle arrest cannot cause dramatic accumulation of global miRNA expression, like RDR1 ectopic expression, in cancer cells ( Figures S2 B and S2C), indicating that miRNA accumulation was not due to cell-cycle arrest. Finally, cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots based on RNA-seq data revealed that miRNA target genes were significantly suppressed by RDR1, compared with non-targeted genes, in cancer cells ( Figure S2 D). Considering that miRNA deficiency and global miRNA suppression are widely reported and closely related to tumorigenesis in many cancers ( Gaur et al., 2007 20. Gaur, A. ∙ Jewell, D.A. ∙ Liang, Y. ... Characterization of microRNA expression levels and their biological correlates in human cancer cell lines Cancer Res. 2007; 67 :2456-2468 Crossref Scopus (616) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin and Gregory, 2015 36. Lin, S. ∙ Gregory, R.I. MicroRNA biogenesis pathways in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15 :321-333 Crossref Scopus (1715) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2005 37. Lu, J. ∙ Getz, G. ∙ Miska, E.A. ... MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers Nature. 2005; 435 :834-838 Crossref Scopus (8580) PubMed Google Scholar ), we therefore proposed that plant RDR1 inhibits cell cycle and proliferation by re-elevating global miRNA expression to rescue miRNA deficiency in different cancer cells specifically.
First, we had to verify whether miRNA pathway was indispensable for the antitumor effects of RDR1. To this end, we knocked down the expression of DROSHA, DGCR8, and AGO2, using synthetic siRNAs, and found that individual depletion of these key components in miRNA pathway all erased the suppressive effects of plant RDR1 on cell-cycle proteins, including CCND1, CCNE2, CDK6, MCM2, and PLK1, as well as cell proliferation ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Next, we generated cancer and non-cancer control cell lines with consistent AGO2 overexpression ( Figures 2 F and S2 E). We discovered that although AGO2 overexpression alone did not affect cell proliferation, it significantly enhanced the RDR1-mediated inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and cell-cycle proteins in cancer cells ( Figures 2 G and 2H).
Next, using AGO2 antibody, we performed crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq analysis in HepG2 cells with or without RDR1 induction ( Figure S2 F). Using CDF plot analysis, we found that as expected miRNA targets, including cell-cycle genes, were significantly enriched in AGO2 CLIP-seq samples ( Figure 2 I) compared with the input samples, suggesting a high affinity of miRNA-containing RISCs with target mRNAs. Also, interestingly, RDR1 induction dramatically enhanced the binding and recognition of RISCs with target cell-cycle genes ( Figures 2 I, 2J, and S2 G; Table S1 ). These results strongly indicated that RDR1 interfered with cell-cycle genes by using a miRNA-mediated regulatory network ( Figure S2 H).
To experimentally verify this hypothesis, we cloned 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), containing miRNA target sites, of cell-cycle genes (including CCNE1, CDK6, and CDC25A) into the dual-luciferase reporter vector, separately, and we used the relative Renilla:firefly luciferase activity to measure the repression efficiency of miRNAs quantitatively ( Figure S2 I). As expected, RDR1 expression significantly reduced the activity of Renilla luciferase in HCT116 and H1299 cells, with dramatic increase of miRNA dosage, but not in RPE-1 cells ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and 2K). Furthermore, AGO2 overexpression obviously strengthened the repression of RDR1 on luciferase genes in A549 cells ( Figure 2 L). By contrast, mutations on miRNA target sites erased all the above repression effects of plant RDR1 on the reporter luciferase in cancer cells with or without AGO2 overexpression ( Figures 2 K, 2L, and S2 I), directly proving that RDR1-mediated targeting and inhibition of cell-cycle genes were through miRNA molecules.
We next aimed to understand the mechanism for RDR1-mediated enhancement of miRNA pathway, particularly in cancer cells. We performed large-scale data mining and analysis on published small RNA-seq data, including 9,980 human patient samples belonging to 32 types of cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, 62 non-TCGA primary tumor samples belonging to 4 types of cancers, 39 normal healthy tissues, and 26 cancer cell lines from other studies ( Table S4 ). Very surprisingly and interestingly, we found that in many primary tumors and cancer cell lines, 3′ ends of many miRNAs were mainly 1 nt shorter than the annotation, and these 1-nt-shorter miRNAs became the largest population among different miRNA isoforms and much more abundant than normal annotated miRNAs that remained the predominant isoform in healthy control tissues and cells ( Figures 3 A and S3 A; Table S4 ). These abnormal 1-nt-shorter miRNA isoforms were widely accumulated across all the primary tumor samples, covering around 30%–70% of miRNA populations from uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), as well as in different cancer cell lines ( Figures 3 B, 3C, and S3 B–S3D; Table S4 ). Experimentally, using small RNA northern blot, we verified the accumulation of 1-nt-shorter isoforms of several quite abundant miRNAs, including miR-27a, -28, and -29a, specifically in cancer A549, HCT116, HepG2, and H1299 cells but not in RPE-1 cells ( Figure 3 D). Our discovery is consistent with two recently published studies in cutaneous melanoma ( Broseghini et al., 2021 7. Broseghini, E. ∙ Dika, E. ∙ Londin, E. ... MicroRNA isoforms contribution to melanoma pathogenesis Noncoding RNA. 2021; 7 :63 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dika et al., 2021 16. Dika, E. ∙ Broseghini, E. ∙ Porcellini, E. ... Unraveling the role of microRNA/isomiR network in multiple primary melanoma pathogenesis Cell Death Dis. 2021; 12 :473 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Notably, we observed that these isoforms with 1-nt-shorter 3′ ends could be detected among both 5p and 3p arms of miRNAs derived from the same precursors ( Figures S3 A and S3E). Therefore, we proposed that the problematic miRNA duplexes with 1 nt overhang, which are 1 nt shorter than normal miRNA duplexes with 2 nt overhang, could not be loaded into AGO2 protein efficiently to form functional RISCs ( Ma et al., 2004 38. Ma, J.B. ∙ Ye, K. ∙ Patel, D.J. Structural basis for overhang-specific small interfering RNA recognition by the PAZ domain Nature. 2004; 429 :318-322 Crossref Scopus (572) PubMed Google Scholar ), eventually leading to the decrease of global miRNA expression in cancer cells. By in vitro incubating recombinant AGO2 (rAGO2) purified from insect cells with synthetic miR-10a duplex isoforms containing 1 or 2 nt overhangs, followed by either gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) or microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay, we indeed proved that 1-nt-overhang miRNA duplexes cannot be loaded into rAGO2 as efficiently as 2-nt-overhang ones ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Also, in vivo in cancer A549 and HepG2 cells, AGO2-immunoprecipitation (AGO2-IP) combined with small RNA-seq revealed that, compared with annotated miRNAs derived from 2-nt-overhang duplexes that were clearly enriched in AGO2-IP sample, 1-nt-shorter miRNAs were much more abundant in input samples than in AGO2-IP samples ( Figures 3 G and 3H). Thus, in cancer cells abnormal miRNA duplex isoforms with 1 nt overhang cannot be loaded into AGO2 effectively and are unstable ( Bartel, 2018 3. Bartel, D.P. Metazoan microRNAs Cell. 2018; 173 :20-51 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2504) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu and Kim, 2020 61. Yu, S. ∙ Kim, V.N. A tale of non-canonical tails: gene regulation by post-transcriptional RNA tailing Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :542-556 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), which therefore might be related to the decreased miRNA dosage in different tumors ( Gaur et al., 2007 20. Gaur, A. ∙ Jewell, D.A. ∙ Liang, Y. ... Characterization of microRNA expression levels and their biological correlates in human cancer cell lines Cancer Res. 2007; 67 :2456-2468 Crossref Scopus (616) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2005 37. Lu, J. ∙ Getz, G. ∙ Miska, E.A. ... MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers Nature. 2005; 435 :834-838 Crossref Scopus (8580) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Very surprisingly, we noticed that mature miRNAs with 3′ end mononucleotide extensions were obviously enriched, corresponding to RDR1 ectopic expression in cancer, but not in non-cancer, cells ( Figures 3 I and S4 A–S4C). RDR1 mainly added mononucleotides, but not two or more nucleotides, to 3′ ends of miRNAs derived from both 5p and 3p arms of miRNA precursors ( Figures 3 J and 3K). Interestingly, this mononucleotide extension (including A, U, C, or G) mainly appeared on 1-nt-shorter miRNAs but not on miRNAs with annotated cleavage ends ( Figures 3 L and 3M). Small RNA northern blot further confirmed that RDR1 expression was indeed able to dramatically reduce 1-nt-shorter miRNA isoforms and increase the miRNAs with a correct length in cancer HepG2, HeLa, A549, and HCT116 cells ( Figure 2 C).
Above all, we propose that plant RDR1 prefers to recognize AGO2-disassociated 1-nt-shorter miRNA (duplex) isoforms—which are accumulated particularly in cancer, but not in non-cancer, cells—as substrates and modifies these problematic miRNAs with mononucleotide tails. To verify this hypothesis in vivo , we performed siRNA-mediated AGO2 knockdown in cancer A549 cells with or without RDR1 expression for small RNA-seq analysis ( Figures 3 N and S4 D). As expected, this assay showed that AGO2 depletion can indeed further improve the RDR1-mediated miRNA modification with mononucleotide tailing on both 1-nt-shorter miRNA isoforms and the annotated miRNAs in cancer cells ( Figures 3 N, 3O, S4 E, and S4F). This assay demonstrated that artificial depletion of AGO2 resulted in increased AGO2-disassociated miRNA duplexes, even including annotated miRNAs with 2 nt overhang, which eventually served as suitable substrates for RDR1. Altogether, RDR1 is able to recognize 1-nt-shorter AGO2-disassociated miRNA (duplex) isoforms with 1 nt overhang and modifies these mammalian miRNAs with mononucleotides in cancer cells.
Noting that plant RDR6 has been reported to own both RNA polymerase and nucleotidyltransferase activities ( Baeg et al., 2017 2. Baeg, K. ∙ Iwakawa, H.O. ∙ Tomari, Y. The poly(A) tail blocks RDR6 from converting self mRNAs into substrates for gene silencing Nat. Plants. 2017; 3 :17036 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Curaba and Chen, 2008 12. Curaba, J. ∙ Chen, X. Biochemical activities of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :3059-3066 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next set out to characterize the potential nucleotidyltransferase activity of RDR1 protein on mammalian miRNAs. AtRDR1 was cloned into pETDuet-1 vector for expression in bacteria, and three-amino-acids mutation (Asp-to-Ala, 3DA ) at the key catalytic site that was conserved in different species was further generated to produce a mutant version of recombinant AtRDR1 (rAtRDR1), losing enzymatic activity ( Figures 4 A, S5 A, and S5B). After in vitro expression and purification, wild-type (WT) and 3DA mutant rAtRDR1 were incubated with α- 32 P-labeled NTPs and different synthetic miRNA isoforms for miRNA tailing assay ( Figure 4 B). This assay firstly showed that WT rAtRDR1 can add mononucleotides to 3′ end of single-stranded mature miRNAs with different lengths, whereas 3DA mutation destroyed this nucleotidyltransferase activities of RDR1 ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Interestingly, we found that WT, but not 3DA mutant, rAtRDR1 was able to mediate the mononucleotide modification of miRNA duplexes with 1 or 2 nt overhangs, but not the ones with blunt ends ( Figures 4 C–4E and S5 E). Furthermore, we performed RDR1 double tailing assay by using α- 32 P-labeled ATP, followed by non-radioactive ATP/GTP, and this assay clearly showed that RDR1 can only add mononucleotides once to miRNA substrates ( Figures 4 F and 4G), which is consistent with the biochemical features of other nucleotidyltransferase enzymes such as TUTase and fungus RDR ( Aalto et al., 2010 1. Aalto, A.P. ∙ Poranen, M.M. ∙ Grimes, J.M. ... In vitro activities of the multifunctional RNA silencing polymerase QDE-1 of Neurospora crassa J. Biol.

To prove our hypothesis that RDR1 prefers to recognize AGO2-free miRNA duplex isoforms with 1 nt overhang as substrates, rather than normal 2-nt-overhang miRNA duplexes, we performed in vitro RDR1/AGO2 coupling assays. Firstly, we co-incubated 2-nt-overhang miRNA duplexes with both rAGO2 and rAtRDR1 proteins ( Figure 4 H), as well as α- 32 P-labeled ATP, which clearly revealed that AGO2 protein can interfere with the RDR1-mediated miRNA tailing reactions dosage dependently ( Figure 4 I), suggesting a direct competition between AGO2 and RDR1 proteins on the recognizing and binding of miRNA duplexes, which is consistent with the previous result showing that AGO2 depletion could greatly enhance RDR1-mediated miRNA tailing events in cancer cells in vivo ( Figures 3 N, 3O, and S4 D–S4F). Furthermore, we pre-incubated rAGO2 with miRNA duplexes with 1 nt/2 nt overhangs for 30 min and then added rAtRDR1 and α- 32 P-labeled ATP for miRNA tailing assay ( Figure 4 J). This analysis revealed that since 2-nt-overhang miRNA duplexes can be loaded into AGO2 efficiently ( Figures 3 E–3H), they were occupied predominantly by increased rAGO2 and therefore could not be further recognized and modified by RDR1. Comparably, 1-nt-overhang miRNA duplexes with low AGO2 affinity could be modified by RDR1 after pre-incubation with similar concentrations of rAGO2 proteins as for 2-nt-overhang duplexes ( Figure 4 K).
At last, we performed in vitro RDR1 tailing assay using 1-nt-shorter miRNA duplexes with 1 nt overhang, and the products of which were then purified for miRNA/AGO2 loading assay ( Figure 4 L). We found that, compared with 3DA mutant rAtRDR1 that cannot mediate miRNA modification, by mononucleotide tailing, WT rAtRDR1 was able to modify 1-nt-shorter miRNA duplexes and repair their 2 nt overhang to greatly increase their loading efficiency into rAGO2 ( Figure 4 M). Furthermore, in vivo , we performed AGO2-IP followed by small RNA-seq analysis in A549 and HepG2 cells expressing AtRDR1. miRNA isoforms with mononucleotide tails, which might be mainly modified by RDR1, can be successfully and efficiently loaded into AGO2 protein, similarly to normal untailed miRNAs derived from duplexes with 2 nt overhang ( Figures S5 F–S5H). Finally, we transfected the same number of miR-34c duplexes with 1 or 2 nt overhangs and single-stranded miR-34c-5p, separately, into cancer HepG2 cells with RDR1 expression, in which expression of miR-34c cannot be detected; here, AGO2-IP followed by small RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that, compared with 2-nt-overhang miR-34c duplexes that can be efficiently loaded into AGO2, 1-nt-overhang miR-34c duplexes loaded into AGO2 were significantly reduced, whereas single-stranded miR-34c-5p could not be detected in AGO2-IP samples ( Figures 4 N, 4O, and S5 I). Notably, only 5p strand of miR-34c duplexes was retained in AGO2-IP samples, and miR-34c-3p was mainly degraded ( Figure 4 O), confirming the previously known strand selection process during AGO/miRNA complex formation ( Bartel, 2018 3. Bartel, D.P. Metazoan microRNAs Cell. 2018; 173 :20-51 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2504) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further detailed analysis on miRNA isoforms revealed that for 2-nt-overhang miR-34c duplexes around 70% of miRNAs loaded into AGO2 were original sequences without tailing modification, which were not affected by ectopic RDR1 expression. However, comparably, for 1-nt-overhang miR-34c duplexes, only no more than 40% of AGO2-binding miRNAs were derived from original duplexes, and miRNAs with mononucleotide modifications, which were clearly strengthened by RDR1 expression, became a main population ( Figures 4 P, 4Q, S5 J, and S5K).
Altogether, we concluded that RDR1 owning nucleotidyltransferase activity is able to recognize and modify AGO2-disassociated 1-nt-shorter miRNA duplex isoforms with 1 nt overhang with mononucleotide tails to restore their AGO2 loading efficiency and eventually repair the defective miRNA pathway in cancers.
To prove the above conclusion in cancer cells in vivo , we generated different cancer cell lines expressing 3DA mutant OsRDR1 protein. We found that after Dox induction, although WT and 3DA mutant OsRDR1 proteins were expressed at a similar level, mutant RDR1 lost the ability to inhibit tumor cell (containing A549, HepG2, H1299, and K562) proliferation ( Figures 4 R and S5 L). Different from WT protein, 3DA mutant RDR1 cannot elevate miRNA expression in cancer cells ( Figure 4 S). Finally, miRNA target gene reporter assay showed that 3DA mutant RDR1 was not able to repress expression of cell-cycle genes, including CCNE1, CDK6, and CDC25A, in HCT116 and H1299 cancer cells ( Figure 4 T). In addition, transcriptomic analysis showed that mutant RDR1 lost the suppressive impacts on cell-cycle pathways and genes in H1299 and K562 cells in vivo ( Figure S5 M).
We next thought to measure the antitumor effects of plant RDR1 in mice in vivo . Firstly, we performed mouse xenograft analysis by injecting RDR1-inducible cancer cells into immunodeficient mice for tumor formation; ectopic expression of RDR1 can be realized by feeding mice with water containing Dox. A549 cells with consistent luciferase gene expression were used for in vivo imaging of tumorigenesis in mice. Bioluminescence assay showed that, after around 7 weeks, the signaling density of tumor tissues was greatly reduced in mice injected with A549 cells with OsRDR1 induction ( Figure 5 A). We found that WT RDR1 can significantly reduce the tumor size, volume, and weight, but 3DA mutant RDR1 protein cannot ( Figures 5 B and 5C). qRT-PCR and western blot analyses indicated that WT, but not 3DA mutant, RDR1 dramatically increased the expression of miRNAs, including miR-22, -182, -192, and let-7g, and reduced several key cell-cycle proteins containing CCND1, CCNE2, CDK6, PLK1, and MCM2 in xenograft tumor tissues ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Finally, global transcriptomic analysis showed that plant RDR1 was able to significantly suppress cell-cycle pathway by inhibiting many cell-cycle genes in A549-derived xenograft tumors in NPG (NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Vst /Vst) mice ( Figure 5 F).
Similarly, we injected H1299 and PC-3 cells with inducible WT or 3DA mutant RDR1 expression into NOG (NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Sug /JicCrl) or NPG mice for xenograft analysis. Here, we detected that WT, but not mutant, RDR1 greatly inhibited tumor size, volume, and weight. We also found that plant RDR1 was able to dramatically elevate miRNA expression to further inhibit cell-cycle process in cancer cells in xenografts derived from H1299 or PC-3 cells in vivo ( Figures 5 G–5P and S6 A–S6C; Table S5 ).
We next evaluated the antitumor effects of RDR1 in leukemia mouse models in vivo . We injected three leukemia cell lines, including Jurkat, K562, and NALM6, with inducible WT or 3DA mutant RDR1 expression into NPG or NOG mice, respectively ( Figures 6 A–6C). Compared with vector control or mutant RDR1, WT RDR1 was able to significantly inhibit cell proliferation of all three leukemia cell lines (Jurkat, K562, and NALM6) ( Figures 6 D–6F; Table S6 ) and eventually extended the lifespan of xenotransplantation mice ( Figures 6 G–6I). WT, but not 3DA mutant, RDR1 can increase miRNA expression dramatically in leukemia cells in mice in vivo ( Figures 6 J–6L). Additionally, we performed polyA(+) RNA-seq for transcriptomic comparison, which showed that plant RDR1 enabled inhibition of cell-cycle pathway by repressing key cell-cycle factors, including CDK1, CCNE2, PLK1, and CDK6, in both Jurkat and NALM6 leukemia cells in animal models ( Figures 6 M, S6 D, and S6E; Table S5 ). To precisely measure the suppressive effect of RDR1 on cell-cycle process in leukemia cells, we isolated donor Jurkat cells from xenotransplantation mice for single-cell (sc) RNA-seq analysis ( Figures 6 N, S6 F, and S6G), which showed that RDR1 retained Jurkat cells in G0/G1 stage in mice, supporting that RDR1 inhibited cell proliferation by repressing cell-cycle process in leukemia cells ( Figures 6 O and S6 H).
Next, we tested the possibility of RDR1 delivery in vitro and in vivo by using different stratagems. WT and 3DA mutant rAtRDR1 proteins expressed and purified in vitro were mixed with red fluorescent R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) protein, separately, to generate nanoparticles, which were then applied for transfection into both cancer and non-cancer cells. After 24 h, R-PE-positive cells with successful transfection were isolated using FACS and cultured for further analysis ( Figure 7 A). Compared with R-PE control and 3DA mutant rAtRDR1 proteins, WT rAtRDR1 significantly inhibited proliferation of cancer cells, including A549, HeLa, and H1299, whereas it did not affect non-cancer cells NIH/3T3 and RPE-1 ( Figure 7 B). Using qRT-PCR analysis, we revealed that WT, but not 3DA mutant, rAtRDR1 protein delivered by nanoparticles dramatically increased the accumulation of miRNAs particularly in cancer cells but not in non-cancer RPE-1 cells ( Figure 7 C). Further transcriptomic comparison indicated that nanoparticle-delivered rAtRDR1 protein inhibited cell-cycle pathway significantly by targeting many cell-cycle genes, including CCNE1, CDK1, MCM4, and PLK4, in cancer cells ( Figures 7 D, S7 A, and S7B; Table S5 ).
Finally, we tested the possibility of RDR1 delivery in vivo in mice by using AAV-delivery system ( Wang et al., 2019 59. Wang, D. ∙ Tai, P.W.L. ∙ Gao, G. Adeno-associated virus vector as a platform for gene therapy delivery Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18 :358-378 Crossref Scopus (1349) PubMed Google Scholar ). We cloned OsRDR1 gene into an AAV vector, and after in vitro purification, viral particles expressing OsRDR1 and control EGFP were injected separately into 26-day-old xenograft tumors (around 100 mm 3 ) that were derived from A549 cells in NPG mice, and 50 days later the xenograft tumors were isolated for detailed characterization ( Figure 7 E). RDR1 delivered by AAV significantly reduced tumor size and weight ( Figures 7 E and 7F). qRT-PCR and western blot analysis suggested that AAV-delivered OsRDR1 was able to dramatically increase miRNA expression to further target and silence cell-cycle genes such as CDK6, CCNE2, PLK1, and MCM2 in tumor tissues in vivo ( Figures 7 G and 7H). Transcriptomic comparison proved that OsRDR1 inhibited cell-cycle pathway in the AAV-delivery xenograft mice model ( Figures 7 I, S7 C, and S7D; Table S5 ). In summary, AAV-delivery system can be used to deliver RDR1 to suppress solid tumor growth in vivo .

Section: Discussion

miRNAs have been identified and studied for around 30 years ( Lee et al., 1993 33. Lee, R.C. ∙ Feinbaum, R.L. ∙ Ambros, V.

Posttranscriptional regulation of the heterochronic gene lin-14 by lin-4 mediates temporal pattern formation in C. elegans Cell. 1993; 75 :855-862 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3354) PubMed Google Scholar ). An increasing number of miRNAs have been reported as tumor suppressors or as oncogenic miRNAs. Clinical trials have been initiated by using either miRNA mimics to rescue miRNA functions as tumor suppressors or by using synthetic antisense oligonucleotides to block oncogenic miRNAs. However, these tests all face many challenges at the preliminary clinical phase due to strong toxicological effects ( Rupaimoole and Slack, 2017 47. Rupaimoole, R. ∙ Slack, F.J.

Drug Discov. 2017; 16 :203-222 Crossref Scopus (3585) PubMed Google Scholar ; Slack and Chinnaiyan, 2019 50. Slack, F.J. ∙ Chinnaiyan, A.M.

Interestingly, previous studies indicated that reduction of miRNA expression and deficient miRNA pathway are very important for tumorigenesis ( Lin and Gregory, 2015 36. Lin, S. ∙ Gregory, R.I.

Recurrent DGCR8, DROSHA, and SIX homeodomain mutations in favorable histology Wilms tumors Cancer Cell. 2015; 27 :286-297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the distinct features of miRNA isoforms have not been systematically described in cancer. By large-scale data mining of published small RNA-seq data covering more than 10,000 human primary patient samples, we discovered abnormal accumulation of 1-nt-shorter miRNA isoforms, widely and particularly existing in many different human primary tumors and cancer cell lines but not in healthy tissues or non-cancer cell lines. We propose that the generation of unusual miRNA duplexes with 1 nt overhang, which cannot efficiently be loaded into AGO2 to form functional RISCs, might be a potential cause for the accumulation of 1-nt-shorter miRNA isoforms in cancer cells. However, after analyzing the published RNA-seq data about the mutants and expressional level of known components participating in miRNA biogenesis or metabolism, we have not found any potential common pathogenic drivers taking part in the abnormal and widespread accumulation of shorter miRNA isoforms in different human cancers, suggesting an unknown mechanism that needs to be further explored in the future.
Nevertheless, our data revealed that plant immune protein RDR1 owning nucleotidyltransferase activity is able to recognize 1-nt-shorter miRNA duplexes that are poorly associated with AGO2 as substrates and to modify these miRNAs by adding mononucleotide tails. This function of RDR1 restores the 2 nt overhang of miRNA duplexes to allow the enhancement of miRNA/AGO2 association and stabilization of miRNAs and therefore can increase miRNA dosage to eventually reactivate deficient miRNA pathway particularly in cancer, but not in non-cancer, cells. Thus, compared with previous strategies of targeting particular oncogenic or tumor-suppressive miRNA(s), RDR1-mediated reactivation and enhancement of defective miRNA pathway, particularly in cancer cells, might be an effective and broad antitumor stratagem with limited toxicological effects on healthy tissues.
Multiple clinical trials studying the application of cell-cycle inhibitors in cancer therapies are ongoing, and a few of them have been successfully used in clinics ( Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009 40. Malumbres, M. ∙ Barbacid, M. Cell cycle, CDKs and cancer: a changing paradigm Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9 :153-166 Crossref Scopus (3000) PubMed Google Scholar ; Otto and Sicinski, 2017 45. Otto, T. ∙ Sicinski, P. Cell cycle proteins as promising targets in cancer therapy Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2017; 17 :93-115 Crossref Scopus (1372) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suski et al., 2021 54. Suski, J.M. ∙ Braun, M. ∙ Strmiska, V. ... Targeting cell-cycle machinery in cancer Cancer Cell. 2021; 39 :759-778 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, similarly to many other pharmacological compounds for targeted therapy, cell-cycle inhibitors cannot overcome drug resistance caused by cell-cycle gene redundancy and tumor cell heterogeneity ( Holohan et al., 2013 26. Holohan, C. ∙ Van Schaeybroeck, S. ∙ Longley, D.B. ... Cancer drug resistance: an evolving paradigm Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13 :714-726 Crossref Scopus (3543) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, essential cell-cycle genes are targeted and post-transcriptionally suppressed by many different miRNAs. Although previous studies focusing on particular oncogenic or tumor-suppressive miRNAs have shown that these miRNAs can individually participate in tumorigenesis, it seems to be that all biological processes are controlled by multiple different miRNAs. We therefore suggest that miRNAs mediate a network regulation to eventually govern different biological processes as “cellular buffer,” and global miRNA dosage plays critical roles in cell fate transitions ( Cui et al., 2021 11. Cui, Y. ∙ Lyu, X. ∙ Ding, L. ... Global miRNA dosage control of embryonic germ layer specification Nature. 2021; 593 :602-606 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; DeVeale et al., 2021 15.

Lin, S. ∙ Gregory, R.I. MicroRNA biogenesis pathways in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15 :321-333 Crossref Scopus (1715) PubMed Google Scholar ). We revealed that plant RDR1 is able to reactivate defective miRNA pathway, leading to an increase of global miRNA dosage in cancer cells. Therefore, RDR1 efficiently and broadly enables miRNA-mediated network inhibition of the cell-cycle process, which is different from all previous stratagems.
There are various small RNA pathways in different species. RDR, which is lacking in mammals with secondary immunity, is the key component for siRNA pathways in plants. Here, although we have successfully expressed plant RDR1 proteins in mammalian cells, these cross-species bioengineered RDR1 proteins fail to rebuild an artificial siRNA pathway. One explanation is that other cofactors of RDR are required to synthesize dsRNAs or that mammalian cells own certain control system(s) to prevent the production of siRNAs or dsRNAs. Surprisingly and unpredictably, we found that RDR1 protein with RNA nucleotidyltransferase activity can modify mammalian miRNAs to eventually restore and partake in miRNA pathway in cancer cells, although none of the RDR proteins has been reported to be involved in miRNA pathway in plants or other species. It is very interesting that several known nucleotidyltransferases, including TUTs and RDRs, all add mononucleotide tails to RNA substrates; however, a detailed biochemical explanation is still required.
In this study, we discovered that abnormal 1-nt-shorter miRNA isoforms are widely and generally accumulated in many different human primary tumors and cancer cell lines, but not in healthy tissues and non-cancer cell lines, whereas the underlying mechanism still needs to be explored. RDR protein can be further optimized based on evolutionary conservation to obtain the minimal peptide for the future drug development, and many different delivery systems should be tested to eventually realize targeting different types of tumors.

All animal experiments were performed according to the Animal Protection Guidelines of Peking University, China. NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Vst /Vst (NPG) and NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Sug /JicCrl (NOG) mice were purchased from Beijing Vitalstar Biotechnology and Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology, respectively. Mice were fed regular chow and housed in a pathogen-free animal facility under a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle at 22°C in Beijing Vitalstar Laboratory and Beijing Vital River Laboratory. Xenograft experiments were performed on 4-6 weeks old mice. Female mice were used for all cancer models except PC-3 xenograft models. For doxycycline (Dox)-regulated RDR1 induction, Dox-containing drinking water was provided to the mice (1 mg/ml, Sigma D9891).
All mouse and human cell lines were cultured at 37°C with 20% (v/v) O 2 and 5% (v/v) CO 2 . Solid tumor cell lines (A549, HCT116, HeLa, HepG2, H1299, PC-3 and U-2 OS), HEK293T, NIH/3T3 and RPE-1) were cultured with DMEM (Gibco, 11965092) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Gemini, 900-108), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, 25030081), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (ThermoFisher, 60-24-2) and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, 15140163). Leukemia cell lines (Jurkat, K562 and NALM6) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, 11875101) with 10% (v/v) FBS (Gemini, 900-108) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, 15140163). V6.5 cell line was cultured on 0.2% gelatin (Sigma, G1890) in Serum/LIF medium composed of DMEM (Gibco, 11965092), 15% FBS (Gibco, 1009914), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, 25030081), 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, 15140163), 1X non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco, 11140050), 1X sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (ThermoFisher, 60-24-2) and 1000 U/ml mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (mLIF) (Millipore, ESG1107). Primed ESC cell line WIBR3 was grown on matrigel (Corning, 354277) and cultured in Essential 8 medium (Cellapy, CA1014500). Cells were passaged using 0.5 mM EDTA every 3-6 days at a split ratio of 1:3-1:6.
All Dox-inducible cell lines expressing AtRDR1 or OsRDR1 were cultured with the same medium as described above supplemented with 100 ng/ml Dox (low concentration) before cell sorting or 4 μg/ml Dox (high concentration) to induce RDR1 expression. Dox was replenished every day.
To generate stable cell lines with Dox-inducible RDR1 expression, plant AtRDR1 and OsRDR1 cDNA were generated using SuperScript IV RT kit (Invitrogen, 18090010). AtRDR1 and OsRDR1 were FLAG-tagged and then cloned into pTRE-EGFP lentiviral vector with the T2A-EGFP fragment using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (NEB, E2611S). To generate lentiviral particles, pTRE-RDR1-T2A-EGFP or pLVX-Tet3G together with psPAX2 and pMD2.G plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Invitrogen, 11668019) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The lentivirus was harvested 51 h after transfection. Different cell lines were then transduced by incubating with the appropriate volume of lentiviral particles in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Solarbio, H8761) for 24 h. Thereafter, 100 ng/ml Dox was added to the medium for 24 h. Next, EGFP+ cells were sorted using BD FACSAria™ III to obtain stable cell lines with inducible expression of plant RDR1.
To generate stable cell lines with consistent RDR1 expression, OsRDR1-T2A-EGFP fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pSIN-EGFP vector. The steps of generating lentiviral particles were described above. For V6.5, EGFP+ cells were sorted by flow cytometry and then expanded. For WIBR3, 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma, 540411) was used to select positive cells before sorting by flow cytometry.
To generate stable cell lines with human AGO2 overexpression, MYC-AGO2 fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pSIN-EGFP vector. The steps of generating lentiviral particles were described above. After 48 h of infection, 2 μg/ml puromycin was used to select cells with MYC-AGO2 overexpression for 2 days.
To generate stable cell lines with catalytic mutant RDR1 expression, Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB, E0554) was used to generate the OsRDR1 mutant, of which the 430 th , 432 nd , 434 th aspartates were substituted by alanine. The remaining steps were similar to those for generating RDR1 stable cell lines.
For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH7.6], 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 ) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF (Beyotime, ST506), and then mixed with 4 x NuPAGE™ LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, NP0007) before incubating at 98°C for 10 min. Subsequently, the protein samples were loaded for SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, IPVH07850) using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) at room temperature for 2 h, followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Following three 10 min washes with TBST, membranes were incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h while shaking. After three 10 min washes in TBST, the membrane was detected by Western ECL substrate and imaged with Amersham lmager 600 (GE Healthcare). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-ACTIN (1:5000, ABclonal, AC004), anti-FLAG® M2-Peroxidase (HRP) (1:3000, Sigma, A8592), anti-HIS (1:2000, ABclonal, AE028), anti-MYC (1:3000, Millipore, 05-724), anti-GFP (1:2000, ABclonal, AE012), anti-AGO2 (1:2000, ABclonal, A19709), anti-CCND1 (1:2000, ABclonal, A19038), anti-CCNE2 (1:2000, ABclonal, A7032), anti-CDK6 (1:2000, ABclonal, A1545), anti-MCM2 (1:2000, ABclonal, A1056) and anti-PLK1 (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-17783).
The mCherry fragment was PCR amplified and cloned into pTRE-EGFP lentiviral vector with FLAG-OsRDR1 and T2A-EGFP fragments by using Gibson Assembly Master Mix to research the location of RDR1 in living cells. Lentiviral particles were prepared as described above and viral transductions were performed in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. Similarly, 100 ng/ml Dox was added to the medium for 24 h and EGFP+/mCherry+ cells were sorted by flow cytometry. To detect the localization of RDR1 in living cells, the medium containing 4 μg/ml Dox is used to induce mCherry-OsRDR1 expression for 60 h. After washing the cells twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Solarbio, C0065) at room temperature for 30 min. The imaging was performed using Nikon A1RSi+ Confocal microscope with 100× oil immersion objective in a live cell imaging chamber.
Different cancer cell lines or non-cancer control cell lines were seeded in 12-well plates at 10,000 cells per well on day 0. For RDR1-inducible cell lines, dox (4 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium and replenished every day. After digestion, cells were stained with 0.4% trypan blue staining solution (Coolaber, SL7120) and counted using Coulter Counter. The number of cells was measured at a fixed time for 5-6 days.
In six-well culture dishes, 500 cells were seeded per well in the presence or absence of Dox (4 μg/ml). After 7 days, the culture medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 30 min, stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Solarbio, G1063) for 30 min, washed with pure water and dried. Colonies were counted manually.
Before wound healing assay and cell invasion assay, medium that contained 4 μg/ml Dox was used to induce RDR1 expression for 72 h. In wound healing assay, cells were seeded in culture-inserts (ibidi, 81167) at a density of 40,000 cells per well in the presence or absence of Dox (4 μg/ml). After 24 h, the culture-insert was gently removed and the cell layer was washed with PBS to remove cell debris and non-attached cells. The μ-Dish was filled with serum-free medium to prevent cell proliferation and induce migration. Cells were imaged directly after removing the culture-insert and 18 h later. The relative distance and areas were quantified using image J.
Cell invasion was measured using BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (Corning, 354480) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, inserts were rehydrated with Opti-MEM (Gibco, 31985070) for 2 h in humidified cell culture incubator. In each insert, 30,000 cells were seeded in DMEM basic medium. Complete medium described above was added in the lower chamber. After 18 h invasion, cells in the lower surface of the chamber were fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 30 min, visualized with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. Invasion cells were counted manually.
Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was used to delete the T2A-EGFP fragment in pTRE-RDR1-T2A-EGFP vector. Lentiviral particles were prepared as described above and 100 × Geneticin (Gibco, 10131027) was used to obtain RDR1 cell lines without EGFP expression. Six days after induction of RDR1 expression, cell cycle stage was determined using BeyoClick™ EdU Cell Proliferation Kit with Alexa Fluor 488 (Beyotime, C0071) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with EdU (10 μM final concentration) for 120 min, digested using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, fixed in 4% PFA followed by permeabilization in PBS/0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min. After washing three times in washing buffer (PBS/3% BSA), click reaction solution was added to the tube and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the cell suspension was washed in washing solution and counterstained with propidium iodide (PI) (Solarbio, C0080) diluted in PBS with RNase. The samples were analyzed on a Beckman CytoFLEX S device.
For cell cycle inhibition and small RNA-seq assay, HeLa cells were incubated for 48 h with 0.5 μM palbociclib (Selleck, S4482) or DMSO and harvested for EdU/PI staining or small RNA-seq assay. The method of staining and detection of the cell cycle stage is the same as above.
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596026) was used to isolate total RNA from cells or tumor tissues according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For miRNA qRT-PCR, 500 ng or 1 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase I (NEB, M0303) to remove genomic DNA and E. coli Poly(A) Polymerase (NEB, M0276) to add poly(A) tail to RNA. M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (NEB, M0253) was used to synthesize cDNA. 2X Realtime PCR Mix (Mei5 Biotech, MF013) and Applied Biosystems SteponePlus Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher) were used to quantify the cDNA in duplicate or triplicate for miRNA qRT-PCR.
For Northern blot, small RNA was enriched by 5 M NaCl and 30% PEG8000 (Sangon biotech, A600433) from total RNA for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 45 min at 4°C, the supernatant was precipitated by 100% ethanol. Denatured small RNA (2 μg) was separated on a 15% Urea PAGE gel and transferred to Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences, RPN1210B) membranes by semi-dry transfer for 90 min at constant 10V. For detection of miRNA, membrane was chemically crosslinked with EDC (Sigma, E7750) for 2 h at 60°C. Indicated miRNA probes were 5’-labelled by T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB, M0201L) and γ- 32 P-ATP for 1 h at 37°C. Chemically-crosslinked membranes were hybridized with 5’-labelled miRNA probes in PerfectHyb™ Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma, H7033) overnight at 42°C. After hybridization, membranes were washed once with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 10 min and twice with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 42°C. Membranes were exposed to an imaging plate overnight and scanned using a laser scanner.
The 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of human CCNE1 (1583 bp to 1942 bp), CDK6 (7556 bp to 8155 bp), and CDC25A (2486 bp to 2873 bp) containing RDR1-targeted miRNA sites were PCR amplified and cloned into the XhoI and NotI sites of psiCHECK2 vector (Promega, C8021). As a control, the RDR1-targeted miRNA sites in the human CCNE1 , CDK6 UTRs were mutated using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. For transfection, different cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates in the presence or absence of Dox (4 μg/ml) to induce RDR1 or RDR-Mut expression. After 96 h, the cells were transfected with 2 μg luciferase reporter plasmids using Lipofectamine™ 3000. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The relative luciferase activity was measure by TransDetect ® Double-Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Transgen, FR201) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
For DROSHA, DGCR8 and AGO2 knockdown, siRNAs and Lipofectamine 3000 reagent were diluted with Opti-MEM medium and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Next, the mixtures were added to the 12-well plates seeded with 10,000 cells in advance. After 8 h of transfection, the medium was changed to normal culture medium with or without Dox (4 μg/ml). After 72 h, the cells were harvested and lysed for Western blot to verify the knockdown. After 120 h, the cells were counted using Coulter Counter and lysed for Western blot to detect the expression of different cell cycle proteins.
For AGO2 knockdown in RDR1 cell lines followed small RNA-seq assay, AtRDR1 expression was first induced in A549 cells with 4 μg/ml Dox for 48 h. Next, si NC and si AGO2 were transfected into A549 cells as described above. After 48 h of transfection and Dox treatment, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis and small RNA-seq following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Chemically synthesized single-stranded miRNAs were heated to 94°C in duplex buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol) for 1 min and then gradually cooled. After annealing, the miRNA duplex was labelled with T4 PNK and γ- 32 P-ATP at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently, 50 nM of 5’ labelled-miRNA duplexes were incubated with a dilution series of recombinant AGO2 proteins and recombinant RNasin® Ribonuclease Inhibitor in reaction buffer (20 mM Tri-HCl [pH 7.6], 67 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT) for 30 min at 37°C. The concentration gradient of rAGO2 ranges from 0.039 to 1.25 μM. The mixture was analyzed by 5% Native PAGE on ice at 100V for about 2 h. Gels were exposed onto an imaging plate for 4 h and scanned using a laser scanner. The gray value of each band was measured by ImageJ. The fraction bound and Kd values were calculated by Prism 7.
For electrophoretic mobility shift assays of the binding of rAGO2 to 1nt-overhang miR-10a incubated with rAtRDR1 or rAtRDR1-Mut, 5′-PNK-labelled 1nt-overhang miR-10a was first incubated with rAtRDR1 or rAtRDR1-Mut and non-radioactive ATP, then purified and incubated with different concentrations of rAGO2 same above. The probe incubated with rAtRDR1 or rAtRDR1-Mut only was used as a negative control. Fraction bound was calculated by ImageJ and Kd values were obtained using Prism.
Chemically synthesized FAM-labelled miRNAs were annealed at 94°C in duplex buffer for 1 min and then gradually cooled. After annealing, 100 nM of FAM-labelled miRNA duplexes were incubated with a dilution series of rAGO2 for 30 min at 37°C. The concentration gradient of rAGO2 ranges from 0.039 to 5 μM. The reaction mixture was then loaded into standard glass capillaries for MST assay. The MST assay was measured at room temperature using 20% LED power and 40% MST power in the MST machine (NanoTemper Technologies; München, Germany). Data were analyzed using the software MO.AffinityAnalysis and Prism 7.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain of Arabidopsis thaliana RDR1 spanning residues 372-931 (recombinant AtRDR1, rAtRDR1) was amplified by PCR and cloned into SalI and NotI sites of pETDuet-1 vector with a His 6 -tag for protein purification. The catalytic center of AtRDR1 was mutated (recombinant AtRDR1-Mut, rAtRDR1-Mut) using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. Recombinant AtRDR1 and AtRDR1-Mut were expressed in Escherichia coli Transetta (DE3) cells (Transgen, CD801). Bacteria were cultured in LB media supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin (Sangon biotech, B541011) and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Sangon biotech, B541015). In addition, 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-Thiogalactoside (Sangon biotech, B541007) was added to induce rAtRDR1 and rAtRDR1-Mut expression. The bacteria were cultured at 16°C for 18 h. Bacteria were collected and washed with PBS. The pellets were resuspended with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM PMSF) and lysed using a high-pressure homogenizer. Following centrifugation at 17,000 g at 4°C for 45 min, the supernatant was incubated with IDA-Ni Beads (Beaverbio, 70501-5) at 4°C for 2 h. Next, the beads were washed twice with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 80 mM imidazole (Sigma, I2399), resuspended in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 400 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT) and then incubated at 4°C for 30 min to elute rAtRDR1 or catalytic mutant rAtRDR1-Mut.
His-tagged recombinant human AGO2 protein (>95% purity) was purchased from Sino Biological. Briefly, total human rAGO2 was (Met 1-Ala 859) was expressed with a polyhistidine tag at the N-terminus and affinity purified from baculovirus-insect cells.
For in vitro RDR polymerase assay of miRNA duplexes with different overhang types, chemically synthesized single-stranded miRNAs were heated to 94°C in duplex buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol) for 1 min, gradually cooled and used as template for in vitro RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase Assay. Two microliters of rAtRDR1 or rAtRDR1-Mut (4 μg) were assayed in a 20 μl reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 8 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 μl RNasin (Promega, N2111), 0.25 μl α- 32 P-ATP or GTP (∼3,000 Ci per mmol) and 2 μl of 1 μM template RNA at 37°C. In addition, template RNA was labelled by γ- 32 P-ATP with T4 PNK as control. For urea PAGE, the reaction product was mixed with 2X RNA Loading Dye (NEB, B0363S) and incubated for 5 min at 95°C. To separate the reaction products, 15% TBE-Urea Polyacrylamide gel was used. The gel was exposed onto an imaging plate for 2 h and scanned using a laser scanner. For double tailing assay, the first reaction product is purified by RNA Clean & Concentrator column (Zymo, R1017). The second reaction was performed essentially as the first reaction, except that non-radioactive ATP/GTP was used.
For in vitro RDR1 and AGO2 coupling assay, chemically synthesized single-stranded miR-10a were annealed at 94°C in duplex buffer for 1 min and then gradually cooled (miR-10a with 2nt-overhang). One microliter of rAtRDR1 (2 μg) were assayed in a 10 μl reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 8 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 μl RNasin (Promega, N2111), 0.2 μl α- 32 P-ATP (∼3,000 Ci per mmol), 1 μl of 1 μM template RNA and rAGO2 with different concentration gradients for 30 min at 37°C. In addition, template RNAs were labelled by γ- 32 P-ATP with T4 PNK as control. For urea PAGE, 15% TBE-Urea Polyacrylamide gel was used to separate the denatured reaction products. The gel was exposed to an imaging plate for 2 h and scanned using a laser scanner.
For in vitro RDR1 assay of free miRNA duplex, annealed miR-10a with 1nt- or 2nt-overhang was incubated with rAGO2 with different concentration gradients for 30 min at 37°C. rAtRDR1 and α- 32 P-ATP were then immediately added to the reaction. The in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assay was performed essentially as described above. The 5′-PNK-labelled miRNAs were used as size markers. Annealed miR-10a incubated with rAtRDR1 only was used as a negative control. The coupling efficiency was calculated as: (the gray value of each band) / (the gray value of the corresponding negative control). The gray value of each band was measured by ImageJ.
AAV-CAG-FLAG-OsRDR1 for OsRDR1 expression was generated from AAV-CAG-EGFP vector. FLAG-OsRDR1 was cloned between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of AAV-CAG-EGFP vector. AAV viral particles were produced in HEK293T cells. Briefly, AAV-CAG-FLAG-OsRDR1 (70 μg for 10 × 15 cm dishes), Rep/Cap (2/9) plasmids (70 μg for 10 × 15 cm dishes), and helper plasmids (200 μg for 10 × 15 cm dishes) were transfected into HEK293T cells using polyethyleneimine (Sigma, 919012) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested at 60 h post-transfection. AAV-OsRDR1 and AAV-EGFP viral particles were purified using iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation. AVV virus was titered by qPCR using 2X Realtime PCR Mix (Mei5 Biotech, MF013). AAV was delivered into mice by in situ injection.
Before injection, different cell lines transduced with lentivirus expressing RDR1 or RDR1-Mut were induced by 4 μg/ml Dox for 2 days. Dox-containing (1 mg/ml) drinking water was provided to the mice to induce the RDR1 expression.
A549 cells (n = 5 for wild-type A549 group; n = 4 for RDR1-Mut group; n = 3 for AtRDR1 group; n = 5 for OsRDR1 group; 2x10 6 cells per mouse) and PC-3 cells (wild- type, RDR1-Mut, OsRDR1; 2x10 6 cells per mouse; n = 5 for each group) were injected into NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Vst /Vst (NPG) mice. H1299 cells (wild-type, RDR1-Mut, OsRDR1; 2x10 6 cells per mouse; n = 5 for each group) were injected into NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Sug /JicCrl (NOG) mice. All cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank. For A549 xenografts, mice were injected with 200 μl of 15 mg/ml D-Luciferin (Beyotime, ST198) 15 min prior to imaging using the IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). Images were analyzed using Living Image 3.0 software (Caliper Life Sciences). Tumor volume was assessed by calipers, and the tumors were dissected when tumor volume in control mice reached >750 mm 3 . The tumors were weighed and photographed. For miRNA qRT-PCR, polyA(+) RNA-seq and Western blot, each biological sample is derived from tumors of 1-3 mice.
Jurkat cells (wild-type, RDR1-Mut, AtRDR1; 2x10 6 cells per mouse; n = 5 for each group) and NALM6 cells (wild-type, RDR1-Mut, OsRDR1; 1x10 6 cells per mouse; n = 5 for each group) were injected into NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Vst /Vst (NPG) mice. K562 cells (wild-type, RDR1-Mut, AtRDR1, OsRDR1; 2x10 6 cells per mouse; n = 5 for each group) were injected into NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Sug /JicCrl (NOG) mice. All cells were injected into the lateral tail vein. Jurkat, K562 and NALM-6 engraftment was assessed in the peripheral blood using the Beckman CytoFLEX S device. Briefly, 100 μl peripheral blood was taken weekly and lysed by lysing buffer (BD Pharmingen, 555899) to detect the proportion of EGFP+ cells. Dying mice with severely quadriplegic limbs were euthanized to collect whole blood and EGFP+ cells were sorted by BD FACSAria™ III. For miRNA qRT-PCR and polyA(+) RNA-seq, each biological sample was a pool of sorted cells from 4–5 female mice.
For in vivo AAV-mediated RDR1 delivery, A549 cells (wild-type; 1x10 6 cells per mouse; n = 5 for each group) were injected into the flank of NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Vst /Vst (NPG) mice. When tumors reached the mean size of 100 mm 3 , mice were randomly divided into 2 groups at day 26. An intratumoral injection of 4E 11 viral genome copies of AAV-OsRDR1 virus or AAV-EGFP control virus was performed at day 26. Tumor volume was evaluated by calipers. The tumors were weighed and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. For miRNA qRT-PCR, polyA(+) RNA-seq and Western blot, each biological sample is derived from tumors of 2-3 mice.
A549, HeLa, H1299, NIH/3T3, RPE-1 cells were seeded at 50% confluency in 6 cm dishes before RDR1 delivery. The rAtRDR1 or rAtRDR1-Mut (8 μg) were mixed with 0.8 μg R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) protein and diluted with 400 μl 20 mM Hepes in a microcentrifuge tube. The protein solutions were mixed with 16 μl of PULSin (Polyplus-transfection, PT-501-04) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Before transfection, the culture media were replaced by serum-free DMEM. After 12 h of incubation with transfection mix at 37°C, the culture media containing proteins were removed. After 24 h of transfection, cells were digested and R-PE positive cells were sorted by BD FACSAria™ III. For miRNA qRT-PCR and polyA(+) RNA-seq, samples were harvested 8 h after sorting. For living cell counting, cells were digested 48 h after sorting and stained by 0.4% trypan blue staining solution.
Different cells with RDR1 or RDR1-Mut expression were harvested after 2 or 3 days of 4 μg/ml Dox treatment and after 5 or 6 days of 4 μg/ml Dox treatment. Different solid tumor tissues were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then the RNA was extracted using homogenizer and TRIzol for polyA(+) RNA-seq. For library construction, 1 μg total RNA, TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, RS-122-2101), VAHTS Stranded mRNA-seq Library Prep Kits (Vazyme, NR602) and VAHTS Ribo-off Globin & rRNA Depletion Kit (Vazyme, N408) were used following the manufacturer’s instructions. Library samples were analyzed by Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing system.
Total RNA was extracted from different RDR1 cell lines with Dox treatment for 5 or 6 days and corresponding wild-type cells. Spike in RNAs from S2 cells are added to each sample in proportion to the number of cells. 30 μg total RNA was loaded into 15% TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen, EC6885BOX) and 15-50 nt small RNAs were separated. NEBNext® Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina kit (NEB, E7580L) was used to construct small RNA libraries according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library samples were analyzed by Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing system.
For AGO2 CLIP, A549 and HepG2 stable cell lines were induced by 4 μg/ml Dox for 6 days, washed twice with PBS and UV irradiated 3 times at 2000J/cm 2 . Cell were lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 ) supplemented with 1:200 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma, P8849) and 1 U/μl RNasin® Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega, N2111) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, cell lysates were subjected to protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies, 10001D) coated with the monoclonal mouse anti-human Ago2 for 3 h at 4°C (clone 2E12-1C9, Abnova, H00027161-M01). Beads were then washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween-20 (PBST). A small aliquot of beads was resuspended in 4 × NuPAGE™ LDS sample buffer for Western blot. The remaining beads were treated with 4 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 50°C and subsequent phenol/chloroform extraction. CLIP-RNA libraries were constructed using the small RNA library and ribo-off RNA-seq preparation protocol as described above. All libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing system.
For miR-34c transfection assay, HepG2-AtRDR1 stable cell line was induced by 4 μg/ml Dox for 3 days. Annealed miR-34c (2nt- or 1nt-overhang) and single-stranded miR-34c-5p (1nt-shorter) were transfected by Lipofectamine 3000 (30 μl of 1 μM template RNA for each 15 cm plate). After 48 h of transfection, cells were harvested for AGO2 CLIP-seq.
For single-cell RNA sequencing of Jurkat xenograft, Jurkat cells (vector, AtRDR1; 1.5x10 6 cells per mouse) were injected into the lateral tail vein of NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Sug /JicCrl (NOG) mice. Dox-containing (1 mg/ml) water was administered orally to induce the AtRDR1 expression in Jurkat xenograft model. Jurkat engraftment was assessed weekly using the Beckman CytoFLEX S device. After 34 and 36 days, mice of the vector group and the AtRDR1 group were euthanized respectively and EGFP+ cells were sorted by BD FACSAria™ III. EGFP+ cells were resuspended in 1X PBS containing 0.04% BSA and washed twice. Then, the concentration of cell suspensions was adjusted to 900-1200 cells/μl. In total, 16,000 living cells were loaded and libraries were constructed using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Kit v3.1 (10x Genomics, 1000268) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified libraries were analyzed by Nova-seq 6000 sequencing system.
To analyze polyA(+) RNA-seq data, adapters of raw data were trimmed with Trimmomatic software. The quality of these data was evaluated by FastQC software. HISAT2 software with default parameters was used to align sequences to the human genome (hg38, UCSC) and the mouse genome (mm10, UCSC) based on the origin of the cell lines. Output files after sequence alignment were used to obtain gene count matrix with featureCounts software using corresponding UCSC RefSeq as gene annotations. For further analyses, gene counts in each sample were normalized to the total reads of the library to calculate reads per million (RPM). To compare gene expression levels between two samples, fold change (FC) of a gene was calculated using the following formula: (RPM of sample A+1) / (RPM of sample B+1). Relative value is calculated using this formula: (value in sample A)/(value in sample A + value in sample B).
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software was used to perform enrichment analysis for genes. Maximum size of gene set was set at 1000. Gene sets used in GSEA, including KEGG, REACTOME and GO Biological Process, were obtained from MSigDB (v7.4, http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/ ). Cell cycle genes were obtained from KEGG_CELL_CYCLE and REACTOME_CELL_CYCLE_MITOTIC gene sets in MSigDB. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed with ToppFun tool of ToppGene Suite ( https://toppgene.cchmc.org/ ), using Biological Processes of GO as dataset.
The predicted miRNA targets were downloaded from TargetScan (Release 7.1, http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/ ), using default predictions. The miRNA target network was made using Cytoscape software. Cumulative distribution function plot (CDF plot) was used to show the difference of numerical distribution. In order to identify the miRNA target genes enriched in each group (groups with and without RDR1 expression, IP group and input group), RNA-seq data and small RNA-seq data were combined in this analysis. Specifically, miRNAs with both high expression (top-10 highest expressed miRNAs) and differential expression (fold change>1.25) after RDR1 expression were used in target gene prediction with TargetScan. After filtering low expression genes (RPM<5 in all samples), total genes were grouped into targeted genes and non-targeted genes according to whether they were predicted in the previous step. Fold change (FC) of gene expression was calculated by (gene expression with RDR1 expression + 1) / (gene expression without RDR1 expression + 1) or (gene expression in AGO2-IP group + 1) / (gene expression in input group + 1).
Perl and python scripts were used to analyze small RNA-seq data. Adapters of sequences were trimmed and sequences with a length of 19-25nt were retained. In order to identify the class of small RNA sequences (rRNA, tRNA, miRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, lncRNA, mRNA and repeat sequences), Bowtie software was used to align them to the reference sequences without mismatch. The reference sequences were downloaded from the following databases: rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA and mitochondrial genome from NCBI ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ), miRNA from miRbase ( http://www.mirbase.org/ ), tRNA from GtRNAdb ( http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/ ), lncRNA and mRNA from (https://www.gencodegenes.org/), repeat sequence from RepeatMasker reference from UCSC browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables ). 30nt upstream and 30nt downstream of tRNA references were added referring to genome. If a sequence could be annotated more than one type of small RNA, we prioritized the classes as follows: rRNA, tRNA, miRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, lncRNA, mRNA, repeat sequences and mitochondrial genome. Sequences without annotation were annotated as unknown.
To build the index of miRNA, we downloaded the mature miRNA sequences from miRBase, 3nt upstream and 3nt downstream of mature miRNA were added to the references. Each sequence was aligned to the reference using Bowtie software using the following parameters: -a -v 1 -3 3.
To make detailed annotation for aligned sequences, we first defined “tail” and “mismatch” of this analysis. For each sequence, one or more consecutive bases at the 3’ end which did not match miRNA reference were defined as “tail”, and other bases which did not align to reference were defined as “mismatch”. Only the sequences with 0-1nt mismatch and 0-3nt tail were used for further analysis.
When sequences were aligned to more than one mature miRNA, the best alignment was selected for analysis. The best alignment was firstly defined as the one with the least number of mismatches and secondly with the shortest tail. If the number of mismatches and the length of tail were both the same in two or more alignments, these alignments were all considered as best alignments for this sequence. For each mature miRNA, we chose the most abundant sequence without mismatch and tail in WT or (-)Dox sample.
In order to compare the miRNA expression in the line, the count of miRNAs was normalized.
In RDR1 expression group, two ways were used to normalize miRNA data. Fly miRNA was added as spike-in in some samples. In non-spike-in method (including A549, HeLa, HepG2, HCT116 and NIH/3T3), the numbers of miRNAs were normalized to the numbers of total reads of the corresponding library to calculate RPM. In spike-in method (including H1299, Jurkat and RPE-1), the number of miRNAs was multiplied by a factor to make the count of fly miRNAs equal in all samples in a cell line. We used the top-10 highest expressed miRNAs as reference, which did not contain identical miRNAs in fly and human/mouse. Each of these 10 miRNAs was used to calculate a factor and the mean of these 10 factors was used as the factor for this sample for normalization. After normalization between samples within cell lines, the normalized reads of the sample with higher miRNA expression level was set at one million.
In cell cycle inhibition, AGO2-CLIP and AGO2 knockdown experiments, miRNA expression was normalized with non-spike-in method. Some cell lines of RDR1 expression group were used in this analysis (A549, HeLa, HepG2). In order to be consistent with the previous analysis in RDR1 expression group, the normalized reads of the sample with higher miRNA expression level of RDR1 expression group was set at one million.
In the miR-34c transfection assay, miRNA expression was normalized to the expression of endogenous miRNA, which was set at one million. In IP(-)Dox and IP(+)Dox group, relative abundance was calculated by (expression of transfected miR-34c in samples with 1nt-overhang) / (expression of transfected miR-34c in samples with 2nt-overhang).
For tailing analysis, tailing percentage means the percentage of non-template mononucleotide-tailed sequence of each miRNA. In order to detect the overhang of miRNA, stem-loop sequence of miRNAs was obtained from miRBase and the annotation of overhang on each mature miRNA was determined. For every overhang analysis, only miRNAs with 2nt-overhang as the main overhang type were used, which account for the majority of the total miRNAs.
miRNA isoform data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were available from Genomic Data Commons Data Portal (GDC, https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ ) and all “Isoform Expression Quantification” files for TCGA patients available were downloaded using the GDC Data Transfer Tool. Other published data were available from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) and analysis methods followed the methods mentioned previously. Please check Table S4 for the information.
In the comparation of cancer samples (TCGA patients, non-TCGA patients and cancer cell lines) and normal samples, miRNAs with low expression (median of cancer samples<100 or median of normal samples<100) aren’t included in further analyses. The relative ratio is calculated using the formula: (RPM of 1nt-shorter miRNA +10) / (RPM of 1nt-shorter miRNA + RPM of 2nt-overhang miRNA + 20).
To analyze scRNA-seq data, cellranger software was used to align sequences to reference genome and gene count matrix was generated using “count” command. hg38 genome and mm10 genome were merged as the reference. Seurat R package was used to merge the scRNA-seq samples. We used the following filtration criteria for the merged sample: nFeature > 500, percentage of hg38 mitochondria genes < 20%, and percentage of sequence aligned to hg38 > 90%. “LogNormalize” function was used to normalize the count matrix. For principal component analysis (PCA), 2000 variable genes were used using “runPCA” function. “FindNeighbors” and “FindClusters” functions were used to find shared nearest neighbors and identify clusters. UMAP dimensionality reduction was generated with “RunUMAP” function. Cell cycle score was calculated using the function “CellCycleScoring”.
The statistical details and methods are indicated in the figure legends or methods. Statistical analysis was performed by GraphPad Prism 7 and R software version 3.5.1. Data were presented as mean ± SEM or mean ± SD with at least three technical replicates unless otherwise indicated. Statistical results were considered significant when p < 0.05. The statistical tests used and the p-values are listed in the figures and figure legends.
