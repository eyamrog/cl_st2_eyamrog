Title: Calcium transients on the ER surface trigger liquid-liquid phase separation of FIP200 to specify autophagosome initiation sites


Abstract: Summary

The mechanism that initiates autophagosome formation on the ER in multicellular organisms is elusive. Here, we showed that autophagy stimuli trigger Ca 2+ transients on the outer surface of the ER membrane, whose amplitude, frequency, and duration are controlled by the metazoan-specific ER transmembrane autophagy protein EPG-4/EI24. Persistent Ca 2+ transients/oscillations on the cytosolic ER surface in EI24 -depleted cells cause accumulation of FIP200 autophagosome initiation complexes on the ER. This defect is suppressed by attenuating ER Ca 2+ transients. Multi-modal SIM analysis revealed that Ca 2+ transients on the ER trigger the formation of dynamic and fusion-prone liquid-like FIP200 puncta. Starvation-induced Ca 2+ transients on lysosomes also induce FIP200 puncta that further move to the ER. Multiple FIP200 puncta on the ER, whose association depends on the ER proteins VAPA/B and ATL2/3, assemble into autophagosome formation sites. Thus, Ca 2+ transients are crucial for triggering phase separation of FIP200 to specify autophagosome initiation sites in metazoans.

Section: Introduction

Autophagy involves the formation of a double-membrane autophagosome and its delivery to the vacuole (yeast and plant)/lysosomes for degradation of sequestrated materials ( Lamb et al., 2013 24.

Machinery, regulation and pathophysiological implications of autophagosome maturation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2021; 22 :733-750 Crossref Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar ). The core steps of autophagosome formation are the initiation and nucleation of an isolation membrane (IM) and its subsequent expansion and closure into an autophagosome. Yeast autophagosomes are generated at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS), usually one in each cell, which is attached to the vacuole membrane, while autophagosomes are initiated simultaneously at multiple sites on the ER in multicellular organisms ( Nakatogawa, 2020 33.

Formation and maturation of autophagosomes in higher eukaryotes: a social network Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2018; 53 :29-36 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). A set of autophagy-related ( ATG ) genes identified in yeast act at different steps of autophagosome formation ( Ohsumi, 2014 36. Ohsumi, Y. Historical landmarks of autophagy research Cell Res. 2014; 24 :9-23 Crossref Scopus (800) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mizushima, 2020 31. Mizushima, N. The ATG conjugation systems in autophagy Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2020; 63 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon autophagy induction, the Atg17/Atg13/Atg1 complex is targeted to the vacuolar membrane, followed by recruitment of vesicles containing the transmembrane (TM) protein Atg9, and the Vps34 complex for IM initiation ( Mizushima et al., 2011 32.

Atg9 vesicles incorporate into the IM, providing a membrane source for its initiation and expansion ( Yamamoto et al., 2012 51. Yamamoto, H. ∙ Kakuta, S. ∙ Watanabe, T.M. ... Atg9 vesicles are an important membrane source during early steps of autophagosome formation J. Cell Biol. 2012; 198 :219-233 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the IM, Atg9 further recruits downstream autophagy proteins, mediates formation of the ER contact with the extremities of the IM, and acts as a scramblase to move lipids ( Gómez-Sánchez et al., 2018 13. Gómez-Sánchez, R. ∙ Rose, J. ∙ Guimarães, R. ... Atg9 establishes Atg2-dependent contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and phagophores J.

Reconstitution of autophagosome nucleation defines Atg9 vesicles as seeds for membrane formation Science. 2020; 369 :eaaz7714 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In mammalian cells, upon autophagy induction, the FIP200/ATG13/ULK1 complex (the Atg1 complex counterpart) and ATG9 vesicles are first targeted to the ER ( Orsi et al., 2012 37. Orsi, A. ∙ Razi, M. ∙ Dooley, H.C. ... Dynamic and transient interactions of Atg9 with autophagosomes, but not membrane integration, are required for autophagy Mol. Biol.

Commun. 2016; 7 :12420 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ). The VPS34 complex is then recruited for subsequent IM initiation ( Axe et al., 2008 2. Axe, E.L. ∙ Walker, S.A. ∙ Manifava, M. ... Autophagosome formation from membrane compartments enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and dynamically connected to the endoplasmic reticulum J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182 :685-701 Crossref Scopus (1465) PubMed Google Scholar ). During expansion, the entire IM forms dynamic contacts with the ER ( Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009 17. Hayashi-Nishino, M. ∙ Fujita, N. ∙ Noda, T. ... A subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum forms a cradle for autophagosome formation Nat.

ATG9 vesicles interact with but do not incorporate into IMs in mammalian cells ( Orsi et al., 2012 37. Orsi, A. ∙ Razi, M. ∙ Dooley, H.C. ... Dynamic and transient interactions of Atg9 with autophagosomes, but not membrane integration, are required for autophagy Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23 :1860-1873 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multicellular organisms require autophagy proteins that are absent or not involved in autophagy in yeast ( Zhao and Zhang, 2018 57. Zhao, Y.G. ∙ Zhang, H. Formation and maturation of autophagosomes in higher eukaryotes: a social network Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2018; 53 :29-36 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). The integral ER membrane proteins VAPA/B (VAPs) and Atlastin 2/3 (ATLs) facilitate and stabilize the association of the FIP200 complex with the ER ( Zhao et al., 2018 56. Zhao, Y.G. ∙ Liu, N. ∙ Miao, G.Y. ... The ER contact proteins VAPA/B interact with multiple autophagy proteins to modulate autophagosome biogenesis Curr.

Atlastin 2/3 regulate ER targeting of the ULK1 complex to initiate autophagy J. Cell Biol. 2021; 220 :e202012091 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genetic screens in C. elegans also identified two metazoan-specific ER TM proteins, EPG-3/VMP1 and EPG-4/EI24, that are essential for autophagy ( Tian et al., 2010 46. Tian, Y. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Hu, W. ... C. elegans screen identifies autophagy genes specific to multicellular organisms Cell. 2010; 141 :1042-1055 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ). The signal that triggers assembly of the autophagosome-initiating FIP200 complex on the ER is still a mystery.
Ca 2+ is a versatile second messenger in cells ( Sammels et al., 2010 41. Sammels, E. ∙ Parys, J.B. ∙ Missiaen, L. ... Intracellular Ca 2+ storage in health and disease: a dynamic equilibrium Cell Calcium. 2010; 47 :297-314 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cytosolic Ca 2+ signals display spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the form of gradients, sparks, transients, oscillations, and waves ( Lu et al., 2019; Patergnani et al., 2020 26. Lu, F.J. ∙ Sun, J.W. ∙ Zheng, Q.X. ... Imaging elemental events of store-operated Ca 2+ entry in invading cancer cells with plasmalemmal targeted sensors J.

Various aspects of calcium signaling in the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, cell proliferation, and cancer Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :8323 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Distinct subcellular compartments contain different levels of Ca 2+ . Under resting conditions, the free Ca 2+ concentration is about 10–100 nM in the cytosol, 500–800 μM in the ER lumen, and ∼500 μM in late endosomes/lysosomes ( Patergnani et al., 2020 39. Patergnani, S. ∙ Danese, A. ∙ Bouhamida, E. ... Various aspects of calcium signaling in the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, cell proliferation, and cancer Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :8323 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; van der Kant and Neefjes, 2014 47. van der Kant, R. ∙ Neefjes, J. Small regulators, major consequences – Ca 2+ and cholesterol at the endosome-ER interface J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 :929-938 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). These Ca 2+ levels are established and maintained by Ca 2+ channels and pumps ( Patergnani et al., 2020 39. Patergnani, S. ∙ Danese, A. ∙ Bouhamida, E. ... Various aspects of calcium signaling in the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, cell proliferation, and cancer Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :8323 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). ER Ca 2+ homeostasis is achieved by channels releasing Ca 2+ from the ER lumen to the cytosol—including IP3Rs, RyRs, and various leak channels (e.g., the Sec61 complex)—and mechanisms returning Ca 2+ back to the ER such as SERCA pumps and store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE) ( Sammels et al., 2010 41. Sammels, E. ∙ Parys, J.B. ∙ Missiaen, L. ... Intracellular Ca 2+ storage in health and disease: a dynamic equilibrium Cell Calcium. 2010; 47 :297-314 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ; Patergnani et al., 2020 39.

Sci. 2020; 21 :8323 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). In response to various stimuli, Ca 2+ signals generated by different compartments are inter-connected at membrane contact sites. For example, lysosomal Ca 2+ release can further activate the ER-localized IP3Rs and/or RyRs to evoke additional cytosolic Ca 2+ spikes ( Kilpatrick et al., 2013 21. Kilpatrick, B.S. ∙ Eden, E.R. ∙ Schapira, A.H. ... Direct mobilisation of lysosomal Ca 2+ triggers complex Ca 2+ signals J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :60-66 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Changes in the cytosolic and ER store Ca 2+ concentrations are integrated into the core autophagic machinery via distinct mechanisms to regulate autophagy activity ( Bootman et al., 2018 3.

Treatment with the rapid Ca 2+ chelator BAPTA-AM blocks basal and induced autophagy in mammalian cells, suggesting that a certain form of Ca 2+ signal is essential for autophagy ( Gordon et al., 1993 14. Gordon, P.B. ∙ Holen, I. ∙ Fosse, M. ... Dependence of hepatocytic autophagy on intracellularly sequestered calcium J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 :26107-26112 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Engedal et al., 2013 10. Engedal, N. ∙ Torgersen, M.L. ∙ Guldvik, I.J. ...

However, the nature of this Ca 2+ signal remains completely unknown. Here, we show that autophagy stimuli elicit Ca 2+ transients on the outer surface of the ER membrane, which then trigger formation of liquid-like FIP200 puncta for assembly of the autophagosome initiation complex on the ER in mammalian cells.

Section: Results

We investigated at which step autophagy is blocked by BAPTA-AM. Treatment with BAPTA-AM, but not EGTA-AM, blocked the formation of starvation-induced puncta positive for FIP200, WIPI2 (marker for IM), and LC3 (marker for all stages of autophagic structures) ( Figures 1 A–1D, S1 A–S1C, and S1E). This indicates that BAPTA-AM blocks the assembly of autophagosome initiation complexes. BAPTA has much faster Ca 2+ association and dissociation kinetics than EGTA ( Hay et al., 2007 16. Hay, J.C. Calcium: a fundamental regulator of intracellular membrane fusion? EMBO Rep. 2007; 8 :236-240 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). A BAPTA-dependent and EGTA-independent process likely involves a fast and local Ca 2+ signal rather than a steady-state Ca 2+ level ( Burgoyne and Clague, 2003 4. Burgoyne, R.D. ∙ Clague, M.J. Calcium and calmodulin in membrane fusion Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641 :137-143 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next determined the Ca 2+ dynamics on the ER outer surface, where FIP200 puncta are assembled. Diffusible cytosolic Ca 2+ indicators such as Rhod-4 and Fura-2 cannot measure local Ca 2+ perturbations in a sub-micron domain on the ER ( Figure 1 E; Shang et al., 2014 43. Shang, W. ∙ Lu, F.J. ∙ Sun, T. ... Imaging Ca 2+ nanosparks in heart With a new targeted biosensor Circ. Res. 2014; 114 :412-420 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). We developed a CYB5 ER TM domain-tethered GCaMP6f biosensor with GCaMP6f facing the cytosol ( Figures 1 E and S1 D). GCaMP6f-CYB5 displayed a contrast factor of 11.3 ± 0.7, dissociation constant K d of 257.12 ± 9.80 nM, and Hill coefficient (nH) of 1.98 ± 0.12 ( Figure 1 G), indicating that it is a sensitive detector of Ca 2+ changes. The optimal pH for detecting GCaMP6f-CYB5 fluorescence change is pH 7.2 ( Figures S1 F–S1H). The GCaMP6f-CYB5 signal decayed much faster than the Rhod-4 signal in cells treated with the RyR agonist caffeine ( Figure S1 F), indicating that the change in GCaMP6f-CYB5 signal was mostly generated in a nanodomain of the ER-cytosol interface but not in the more distant cytosol. These results indicate that the Ca 2+ biosensor GCaMP6f-CYB5 detects Ca 2+ changes in a narrow spatial domain on the ER outer surface.
Multi-modal structured illumination microscopy (multi-SIM) analysis enables us to detect very rapid and localized changes in the GCaMP6f-CYB5 fluorescence signal. We used multi-SIM to examine the Ca 2+ dynamics on the ER. Under normal growth conditions, most cells exhibited no evident GCaMP6f-CYB5 signal changes during the observation time (300 s), while 13% of cells displayed a small-amplitude signal in restricted regions ( Figures 1 F and 1H; Video S1 ). Upon autophagy induction by Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) starvation, amino acid starvation, and Torin1 treatment, 89%, 92%, and 90% of the cells, respectively, displayed numerous dynamic GCaMP6f-CYB5 fluorescence signal changes that occurred independently and transiently in various regions of the cells, ( Figures 1 F, 1H, and S1 M). The typical forms of Ca 2+ transients on the ER included (1) periodic regional or global ER Ca 2+ transients, called Ca 2+ oscillations ( Figure 1 I), (2) regional ER Ca 2+ transients that occurred randomly at multiple regions of the ER network ( Figure 1 J), (3) regional ER Ca 2+ transients that propagated to multi-area Ca 2+ waves ( Figure 1 K), (4) long-lasting increased regional GCaMP6f-CYB5 fluorescence ( Figure 1 L), and (5) a gradual increase in the fluorescence baseline ( Figure 1 M). ER Ca 2+ transients were detected at different time points (e.g., 40 min or 2 h) after starvation or Torin1 treatment ( Figures 1 F, 1H, and S1 M). The transients were abolished by BAPTA-AM ( Figure 1 F).

The GCaMP6f-CYB5 fluorescence signal in control cells under normal growth conditions detected by multi-SIM, related to Figure 1
Multi-SIM detects ER Ca 2+ transients in a short period of time due to quenching of the fluorescence signal, and only in a part of a cell (3/4 cell per image). To monitor more global Ca 2+ changes on the ER surface over a long period of time, we performed confocal analysis to detect the GCaMP6f-CYB5 fluorescence signal during 2,500 s. In control cells, the signal was generally flat with a few small changes ( Figures 1 N and 1P). In starved or Torin1-treated cells, we detected various forms of dynamic GCaMP6f-CYB5 signals in various subcellular regions ( Figures 1 O–1T, S1 I–S1L, and S1N–S1V). In most cases, full duration at half maximum (FDHM) of the ER Ca 2+ transients was within 20 s ( Figures 1 T and S1 V). In the regions with GCaMP6f-CYB5-labeled Ca 2+ transients, the cytosolic and ER store Ca 2+ indicators showed minor or no changes ( Figures S1 W and S1X). Ca 2+ transients persisted at the late stage of starvation ( Figures S1 R–S1V). BAPTA-AM, but not EGTA-AM, inhibited Ca 2+ transients and baseline elevation ( Figures S1 Y–S1A1). Thus, autophagy induction triggers Ca 2+ transients on the ER cytosolic surface.
BAPTA-AM abolishes Ca 2+ transients on the ER and other membranes. We determined whether reducing Ca 2+ transients specifically on the ER affects autophagosome initiation. In IP3R2/IP3R3 double-knockdown ( IP3R2/3 KD) cells treated with Ca 2+ release channel inhibitors (RCIs, containing the Sec61 complex blocker anisomycin and the RyR inhibitor ryanodine), Ca 2+ transients on the ER outer surface were greatly attenuated upon starvation by multi-SIM analysis ( Figures 2 A–2C). Formation of FIP200 puncta, WIPI2 puncta and LC3 puncta was also greatly reduced under starvation conditions ( Figures 2 D–2F and S1 B1–S1E1), indicating that Ca 2+ transients on the ER are essential for autophagosome initiation.
We next examined whether persistent Ca 2+ transients/oscillations on the ER outer surface affect autophagy. Isoprenaline (ISO) increases RyR-mediated Ca 2+ release and promotes SERCA uptake; thus, ISO stimulates local Ca 2+ dynamics on the ER outer surface ( Figure 2 G). Combined ISO and caffeine treatment, called release channel activator (RCA) treatment, elicited various Ca 2+ signal changes indicated by GCaMP6f-CYB5, including global or regional ER Ca 2+ transients with different intervals between spikes, persistent periodic Ca 2+ oscillations, saltatory propagation of Ca 2+ waves on the ER, and local long-lasting increased fluorescence signals ( Figures 2 H–2N, S1 F1, S1G1, S2 A, and S2B). Thus, RCA treatment increases the frequency, amplitude, and duration of local/global Ca 2+ transients and oscillations on the ER.
Compared with control cells, levels of the autophagy substrate p62, the ratio of LC3-II (PE-conjugated form)/LC3-I (unconjugated form) and the numbers of LC3 and p62 puncta were increased in RCA-treated cells ( Figures 2 O–2S, S2 E, and S2F), indicating that autophagy is impaired. The numbers of puncta formed by FIP200, ATG13, and WIPI2 were also greatly increased by RCA treatment ( Figures 2 Q, 2T–2W, S2 G, and S2H). In HaloTag (HT)-LC3 assays using membrane-permeable and -impermeable HT ligands (MPL and MIL, respectively) ( Takahashi et al., 2018 45. Takahashi, Y. ∙ He, H. ∙ Tang, Z. ... An autophagy assay reveals the ESCRT-III component CHMP2A as a regulator of phagophore closure Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2855 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ), starved control cells accumulated MIL − MPL + structures (representing mature autophagosomes and downstream structures) ( Figures S2 C and S2I). RCA-treated cells contained more membrane-impermeable ligand (MIL) + membrane-permeable ligand (MPL) − and MIL + MPL + puncta (representing IMs and immature autophagosomes, respectively) ( Figures S2 D and S2I). The GFP-RFP-LC3 tandem reporter showed that 3 h after starvation, a large number of red-only (RFP + GFP − , due to quenching of the GFP signal in acidic compartments) LC3 puncta were detected in control cells, whereas yellow (RFP + GFP + ) puncta were predominant in RCA-treated cells ( Figures 2 X, 2Y, and S2 J). Thus, RCA-treated cells mainly accumulate unclosed/immature and/or unacidified autophagic structures. Multi-SIM revealed that in starved control cells, the ring-like LC3 structures on the ER or in the cytosol had diameters of ∼800 nm ( Figure 2 Z). RCA-treated cells contained LC3 dots and small ring-like LC3 structures that associated with the ER ( Figures 2 A1, S2 K, and S2L). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that RCA-treated cells contained small ER-associated autophagosomes and some of them were still open ( Figures 2 B1–2E1 and S2 M). mTORC1 activity was reduced by RCA treatment ( Figures S2 N and S2O). Caffeine inhibits mTORC1 activity and, distinct from RCA treatment, activates autophagy ( Saiki et al., 2011 40. Saiki, S. ∙ Sasazawa, Y. ∙ Imamichi, Y. ... Caffeine induces apoptosis by enhancement of autophagy via PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K inhibition Autophagy. 2011; 7 :176-187 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, persistent Ca 2+ transients/oscillations on the ER outer surface cause accumulation of small unacidified autophagic structures.
Treatment with 10 μM KB-R7943 (Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger [NCX] inhibitor) elevated the cytosolic Ca 2+ and gradually increased the Ca 2+ baseline on the ER surface ( Figures S2 P–S2R). The number of FIP200 puncta and WIPI2 puncta was slightly increased, but autophagy activity was impaired in KB-R7943-treated cells ( Figures S2 T–S2W, S2Y–S2A1, S2C1, and S2D1). KB-R7943 treatment impaired acidification of autophagic structures and induced accumulation of autophagosomes and non-degradative autolysosomes ( Figures S2 J, S2F1, and S2H1). Treatment with 10 μM anisomycin caused an increase in ER store Ca 2+ but did not affect mTORC1 activity ( Figures S2 N–S2Q and S2S). Anisomycin did not affect the number of FIP200 puncta and WIPI2 puncta, but autophagic flux was enhanced ( Figures S2 J, S2T, S2U, S2X, S2Y, S2B1, S2E1, and S2G1). Therefore, an increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ , ER store Ca 2+ , or ER surface Ca 2+ transients causes distinct autophagy phenotypes.

Both cytosolic and ER store Ca 2+ concentrations were slightly increased in EI24 knockout (KO) COS7 cells ( Figures S2 I1 and S2J1). GCaMP6f-CYB5 showed dynamic Ca 2+ signals on the ER in fed and starved EI24 KO cells ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S3 B, and S3D). By confocal analysis, ∼93% of starved EI24 KO COS7 cells showed long-lasting periodic synchronous global Ca 2+ oscillations on the ER outer surface ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and 3F–3I). EI24 KO cells also displayed spatially discrete asynchronous local Ca 2+ events and saltatory propagation of Ca 2+ waves ( Figures S3 A, S3B, and S3D). BAPTA-AM abolished the Ca 2+ transients on the ER ( Figure S3 C). Multi-SIM also revealed an increased frequency and amplitude of ER Ca 2+ transients in EI24 KO cells ( Figures 3 J–3L; Video S2 ). The periodic Ca 2+ transients in EI24 KO cells were largely confined in a narrow domain of the ER-cytosol interface without causing global cytosolic Ca 2+ perturbations ( Figures S3 E and S3F).

The dynamic and periodic transients of the GCaMP6f-CYB5 signal in EI24 KO cells under starvation conditions detected by multi-SIM, related to Figure 3
We examined whether EI24 KO cells exhibit characteristic autophagy phenotypes following RCA treatment. Even under nutrient-rich conditions, EI24 KO cells showed a defect in autophagy ( Figures 3 C–3E, 3M, S3 G, and S3H). FIP200, ATG13, ATG14, and WIPI2 puncta were more abundant in EI24 KO cells ( Figures 3 M–3S), and BAPTA-AM suppressed this increase ( Figures S3 I and S3J). Accumulation of GFP + RFP + yellow LC3 puncta and MIL + MPL − and MIL + MPL + HT-LC3 puncta indicated that autophagic structures in EI24 KO cells were neither acidified nor closed/matured ( Figures 3 T, 3U, 3W, and S3 K). In EI24 KO cells, the ring-like LC3 structures were also small and displayed one or two dots with concentrated LC3 signals ( Figures 3 V and S2 L). TEM revealed that EI24 KO cells accumulated many small unclosed autophagosomes/IMs that were closely associated with the ER and more often detected in areas close to the Golgi complex ( Figures 3 X–3A1, S3 L, and S3M). No defect in COPII vesicle-mediated trafficking was detected in cells subjected to EI24 depletion or treatment with RCA, KB-R7943, or anisomycin ( Figure S3 N). Persistent Ca 2+ oscillations/saltatory propagation of Ca 2+ waves on the ER and characteristic autophagy defects were also detected in other cell types with EI24 KO ( Figures S3 O–S3T; data not shown).
In starved control cells, treatment with RCI or a low concentration of the SERCA inhibitor Thapsigargin (TG, 5 nM) had no evident effect on induction of ER Ca 2+ transients ( Figures S3 U–S3Y and S4V). In IP3R2 KD cells, global ER Ca 2+ transients induced by starvation were reduced, but abundant transients were still generated in multiple restricted areas of the ER ( Figures S3 U–S3X and S3E1–S3G1). Treatment with RCI, 5 nM TG, or IP3R2 siRNA caused no evident autophagy defect ( Figures S3 Z–S3B1, S4 A, S4B, S4Y, and S4Z). However, treatment of EI24 KO cells with RCI, 5 nM TG, or IP3R2 siRNA greatly attenuated the ER Ca 2+ transients/oscillations ( Figures 4 A–4C, S3 C1, S3D1, S4 M, and S4W) and suppressed the autophagy defect ( Figures 4 D–4K, S4 C–S4F, S4T, S4U, S4A1, and S4B1). Normal-sized and closed autophagosomes were formed in EI24 KO cells after RCI treatment or IP3R2 KD ( Figures 4 L–4N). The inhibitory effect of RCI or IP3R2 KD was abolished by adding the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) ( Figures S4 G–S4L). Ca 2+ still underwent periodic oscillations on the ER in EI24 KO cells with simultaneous depletion of IP3R1 or IP3R3 , although the frequency and amplitude were slightly reduced by IP3R3 KD ( Figures S4 N and S4O). The autophagy defect in EI24 KO cells was unaffected by IP3R1 KD or IP3R3 KD ( Figures S4 P–S4S). Thus, the autophagy defect in EI24 KO cells is ameliorated by reducing ER surface Ca 2+ transients/oscillations.
EI24 contains 7 predicted TM domains with the N terminus in the ER lumen and the C terminus facing the cytosol ( Figures S4 X, S4C1, and S4D1). In GFP-Trap assays, EI24 interacted with SERCA2, and the interaction was reduced by TG treatment ( Figures 4 O and 4Q), suggesting that EI24 preferentially binds to the active form of SERCA2. EI24 also co-precipitated IP3R2 and the interaction was enhanced by TG treatment ( Figures 4 P and 4R). Interactions of EI24 with SERCA1/3, IP3R3, and SEC61A were also detected ( Figures S4 E1 and S4F1). This suggests that EI24 may modulate ER Ca 2+ transients by interacting with ER-localized Ca 2+ channels and pumps.
Clustering of IP3Rs has been suggested to amplify ER Ca 2+ release ( Pantazaka and Taylor, 2011 38. Pantazaka, E. ∙ Taylor, C.W. Differential distribution, clustering, and lateral diffusion of subtypes of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :23378-23387 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). GFP-IP3R2, as previously reported, formed small mobile punctate structures on the ER ( Figure S4 G1) ( Pantazaka and Taylor, 2011 38. Pantazaka, E. ∙ Taylor, C.W. Differential distribution, clustering, and lateral diffusion of subtypes of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :23378-23387 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was not affected by starvation ( Figure S4 H1). The distribution of GFP-IP3R3 was largely uniform on the ER with some small, mobile, weakly enriched puncta ( Figure 4 S). Starvation triggered the formation of distinct larger, brighter, and immobile puncta ( Figure 4 T). The signal of jRGECO1a-CYB5 ( Dana et al., 2016 7. Dana, H. ∙ Mohar, B. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Sensitive red protein calcium indicators for imaging neural activity eLife. 2016; 5 :e12727 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ), a red fluorescent Ca 2+ biosensor tethered to the CYB5 ER TM domain, was stronger at the GFP-IP3R3-enriched puncta upon starvation ( Figures 4 U and 4V), suggesting that clustering of IP3R3 may contribute to Ca 2+ transients on the ER.
We used multi-SIM to examine the dynamic assembly of the autophagosome initiation complex in response to ER Ca 2+ transients at a super-fast and super-resolution level in living cells. Upon starvation, GFP-FIP200 formed numerous punctate structures ( Figures S5 D and S5E). The FIP200 puncta were near or on the ER tubules that exhibited Ca 2+ transients indicated by elevated GCaMP6f-CYB5 fluorescence ( Figures 5 A and S5 A–S5C). FIP200 puncta attached to the ER, then moved along the ER tubules, and coalesced with other FIP200 puncta ( Figure 5 B). The ER-attached FIP200 puncta reached up to 200–300 nm in diameter, at which size they failed to fuse ( Figure 5 C). Individual FIP200 puncta could dissociate from one part of the ER surface into the cytosol and then re-attach to another part of the ER ( Figure S5 F). Several ER-attached FIP200 puncta were observed to move together to form a half-ring-like cluster, accompanied by protrusion of a small fragment of the ER tubule toward the FIP200 structure ( Figures 5 C and S5 G). The FIP200 puncta further developed into a ring-like structure. Eventually, the small ER fragment detached and was encircled by the FIP200-ring structure ( Figures 5 C and S5 G). Torin1 treatment also elicited numerous FIP200 puncta in the cytosol near or on the ER, which underwent fusion and formed ring-like structures on the ER ( Figures S5 H and S5J). FIP200 puncta were formed upon RCA treatment ( Figures 5 D and 5E), and then quickly dissolved ( Figure S5 K, purple arrows), or associated with the ER ( Figure S5 L). FIP200 puncta in the cytosol and on the ER underwent fusion ( Figures 5 D and S5 K, white arrows). 10 min after RCA stimulation, numerous FIP200 puncta accumulated on the ER ( Figure S5 I). In EI24 KO cells, FIP200 puncta were abundant and associated with the ER ( Figure 5 F). This was abolished by BAPTA-AM ( Figure S5 M).
LC3 puncta first appeared as dot structures that were attached to but not overlapped with FIP200 puncta ( Figure S5 N). The FIP200 puncta continuously associated with the expanding LC3 structures. Some ring-like LC3 structures were decorated with one or several FIP200 puncta, some overlapped with ring-like FIP200 structures, and some showed no FIP200 association ( Figure S5 N). Endogenous FIP200 puncta also formed clusters associated with LC3 structures ( Figure S5 O). During autophagosome formation, the ER tubules surrounding the LC3 structures were highly dynamic and underwent extensive remodeling ( Figures S5 P–S5R). A small ER fragment was engulfed inside the ring-like LC3 structure ( Figure S5 S). Thus, FIP200 dynamically interacts with the ER and LC3-labeled structures during autophagosome formation.
Lysosomes extensively contact the ER ( Guo et al., 2018 15. Guo, Y.T. ∙ Li, D. ∙ Zhang, S.W. ... Visualizing intracellular organelle and cytoskeletal interactions at nanoscale resolution on millisecond timescales Cell. 2018; 175 :1430-1442.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ) and HBSS starvation triggers lysosomal Ca 2+ release ( Chen et al., 2021 6. Chen, D. ∙ Zheng, Q.X. ∙ Sun, L. ... ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 promotes lysosomal exocytosis-mediated viral egress Dev. Cell. 2021; 56 :3250-3263.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the LAMP1-GCaMP6f sensor, in which GCaMP6f is linked to the C-terminal cytosolic tail of LAMP1, multi-SIM revealed a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity upon HBSS starvation ( Figures 5 G and 5H). HBSS starvation-triggered lysosomal Ca 2+ release also elicited Ca 2+ transients on the nearby ER outer surface, shown by an elevated jRGECO1a-CYB5 signal ( Figure S6 A). Amino acid starvation or Torin1 treatment induced shorter and smaller local Ca 2+ transients on lysosomes ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Small FIP200 puncta were detected on Ca 2+ -releasing lysosomes; these puncta were released into the cytosol, dissolved, or moved directly to the ER ( Figures 5 I and S6 D–S6F). IP3R2 KD slightly elevated lysosomal Ca 2+ store, lysosomal Ca 2+ release, and formation of FIP200 puncta that further moved to the ER ( Figures S6 H–S6K; data not shown). Therefore, lysosomal Ca 2+ transients contribute to the formation of ER-associated FIP200 puncta.
Next, we treated cells with ATP, which promotes a Ca 2+ burst on the ER via opening of IP3R1/3 ( Vervloessem et al., 2015 49. Vervloessem, T. ∙ Yule, D.I. ∙ Bultynck, G. ... The type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, emerging functions for an intriguing Ca 2+ -release channel BBA Mol. Cell Res. 2015; 1853 :1992-2005 PubMed Google Scholar ; Miyakawa et al., 1999 30. Miyakawa, T. ∙ Maeda, A. ∙ Yamazawa, T. ... Encoding of Ca 2+ signals by differential expression of IP3 receptor subtypes EMBO J. 1999; 18 :1303-1308 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment with 100-μM ATP caused a big ER Ca 2+ transient and led to the generation of numerous small mCherry-FIP200 puncta near the ER ( Figure 5 J). Adding Ca 2+ in the culture medium (exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation) is another way of suddenly increasing the cytosolic Ca 2+ , while only slightly and briefly increasing the GCaMP6f-CYB5-labeled Ca 2+ transient on the ER surface ( Figure 5 N). Exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation triggered formation of numerous small FIP200 puncta (initial size ∼60 nm). They grew or fused into large puncta (∼300 nm) that clustered and dispersed in the cytosol but failed to associate with the ER ( Figures 5 K, 5L, S6 L, and S6M). Most of the FIP200 puncta dissolved upon restoration of normal medium ( Figure 6 B). Endogenous knockin sfGFP-FIP200 also formed numerous small puncta that underwent extensive fusion in response to exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation ( Figure S6 N). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis revealed the high dynamics of FIP200 molecules within the puncta formed in starved cells, EI24 KO cells and exogenous Ca 2+ -stimulated cells ( Figures 5 M and 5O). 1,6-Hexanediol caused dispersal of FIP200 puncta induced by exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation or starvation but had no effect on LC3 puncta in starved cells ( Figures S6 O–S6T). The liquid-like properties of FIP200 puncta indicate that FIP200 puncta are assembled via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).
FIP200 contains a dimerizing NTD (aa 1–643), an IDR linker (aa 647–760), two coiled-coil domains (CC1, aa 865–1,232; CC2, 1,285–1,396), and a Claw domain-containing C-terminal region (CTD, aa 1,397–1,594) ( Figure 6 A). The CTD self-associated and interacted with the IDR of FIP200 ( Figure S6 V). Deleting NTD, CC2, or CTD of FIP2000 abolished punctum formation in FIP200 KO cells in response to exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation. Deleting IDR (ΔIDR) impaired punctum formation, while ΔCC1 delayed punctum formation ( Figure 6 B). Upon removal of exogenous Ca 2+ , ΔIDR puncta dissolved much faster than FIP200 puncta, while ΔCC1 puncta rarely disappeared ( Figure 6 B). ΔCC1 puncta were more static than FIP200 puncta in FRAP assays ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Thus, multiple domains modulate the formation and dynamics of FIP200 puncta.
FIP200 forms dissociable interactions with other components of the ULK1 complex (ULK1, ATG13, and ATG101). ATG13 IDR interacts with FIP200 NTD, which then triggers the interaction of ULK1 with FIP200 NTD ( Shi et al., 2020 44. Shi, X.S. ∙ Yokom, A.L. ∙ Wang, C.X. ... ULK complex organization in autophagy by a C-shaped FIP200 N-terminal domain dimer J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219 :e201911047 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). ATG13 also bound to FIP200 CTD in in vitro pull-down assays ( Figure S6 W). Formation of FIP200 puncta in response to starvation or exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation was abolished in ATG13 KO cells ( Figures 6 E and 6F) but was unaffected in ATG101 KO and ULK1 /2 KD cells ( Figures S6 U and S6Y). The FIP200 puncta formed upon exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation immediately recruited ATG13, while ULK1 and ATG101 were only weakly present ( Figures 6 G–6I and S6 X). In this system, co-condensation of ATG13, ULK1, and ATG101 with FIP200 may be influenced by their binding affinity. In starved cells, the initially formed FIP200 puncta were positive for ATG13-GFP, ULK1-GFP, and ATG101-GFP ( Figures S7 A–S7C). VPS34 complex components did not partition into the FIP200 puncta ( Figure S6 Z). In FIP200 KO cells, ATG13 and ULK1 failed to form puncta upon exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation ( Figure S7 D). Thus, FIP200 and ATG13 are essential for Ca 2+ transient-induced phase separation of the ULK1 complex.
We next investigated how FIP200 puncta associate with the ER. FIP200 and ATG13 interact with the ER TM proteins VAPA/B (VAPs) and ATL2/3 (ATLs) ( Zhao et al., 2018 56. Zhao, Y.G. ∙ Liu, N. ∙ Miao, G.Y. ... The ER contact proteins VAPA/B interact with multiple autophagy proteins to modulate autophagosome biogenesis Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :1234-1245.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2021 25. Liu, N. ∙ Zhao, H. ∙ Zhao, Y.G. ... Atlastin 2/3 regulate ER targeting of the ULK1 complex to initiate autophagy J. Cell Biol. 2021; 220 :e202012091 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). The numbers of FIP200 puncta and ATG13 puncta were not evidently affected by depletion of either VAPs or ATL s but were greatly reduced in cells with their simultaneous depletion ( Liu et al., 2021 25. Liu, N. ∙ Zhao, H. ∙ Zhao, Y.G. ... Atlastin 2/3 regulate ER targeting of the ULK1 complex to initiate autophagy J. Cell Biol. 2021; 220 :e202012091 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the accumulation of FIP200 puncta on the ER in EI24 KO cells, the interaction of FIP200 with VAPA was greatly increased ( Figure 6 J). The ER network was grossly abnormal in ATL2/3 KO VAPs KD cells, with enrichment in the perinuclear region. Upon starvation of ATL2/3 KO VAPs KD cells, numerous FIP200 puncta were formed in both the ER-enriched perinuclear region and the ER-depleted region ( Figures S7 E, S7F, and S7I). However, the FIP200 puncta mostly dissolved within a few minutes and only a few persisted ( Figures S7 G and S7H). These results suggest that persistence of FIP200 puncta and their association with the ER depends on VAPs and ATLs.
ATG9 vesicles were dispersed in the cytosol under normal conditions, while they formed enlarged punctate structures in EI24 KO cells ( Figures S7 J and S7K). In starved cells, multi-SIM revealed ATG9 vesicles dynamically surrounding FIP200 puncta ( Figure 7 A). In RCA-treated cells, EI24 KO cells or cells with exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation, ATG9 vesicles formed clusters, which dynamically orbited the FIP200 puncta ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S7 L). Consistent with the enhanced association of FIP200 and ATG9 puncta, in EI24 KO cells and RCA-treated cells, the ATG9-FIP200 interaction was increased ( Figures 7 L, 7M, and S7 M), and the number of puncta showing interaction between FIP200 and ATG9 was increased in the proximity ligation assay (PLA) ( Figures 7 D–7F).
In ATG9 KO cells, endogenous FIP200 accumulated into a few large aggregates or small ring-like structures ( Figures 7 G and 7H), whose number was not further increased by starvation or exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation ( Figures 7 I–7K, S7 N, and S7R–S7U). Multi-SIM revealed that in ATG9 KO cells, FIP200 structures of various sizes associated with the ER, and in some cases, numerous ER-associated GFP-FIP200 puncta, which were relatively static and failed to fuse, formed large complex structures ( Figures 7 N and S7 O–S7Q). The enlarged FIP200 puncta in ATG9 KO cells colocalized with LC3 structures ( Figures S7 T and S7U). Multiple LC3 puncta associated with the complex spherical FIP200 structures in ATG9 KO cells ( Figures 7 O and 7P). Thus, ATG9 vesicles modulate FIP200 phase separation and spatial organization of FIP200 puncta on the ER.

Section: Discussion

The nature of the signal that specifies the assembly of the autophagosome initiation complex on the ER in multicellular organisms is a long-standing unanswered question. We now demonstrate that Ca 2+ transients on the ER cytosolic surface or the Ca 2+ gradient in the nanodomain of the ER-cytosol interface, here collectively called ER Ca 2+ transients, trigger formation of FIP200 puncta. Subsequent ER targeting and spatial arrangement of the puncta specify autophagosome formation sites ( Figure 7 Q). Spatiotemporal cytosolic Ca 2+ signals are generated by the actions of various Ca 2+ channels and pumps ( Yue et al., 2020 53. Yue, L.L. ∙ Wang, L.Q. ∙ Du, Y.C. ... Type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is a crucial regulator of calcium dynamics mediated by endoplasmic reticulum in HEK cells Cells. 2020; 9 :275 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). For example, IP3Rs, which show Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release (CICR) activity, regeneratively recruit the activity of nearby IP3Rs to allow a highly localized transient to grow into larger events such as waves in the cytosol ( Vervloessem et al., 2015 49. Vervloessem, T. ∙ Yule, D.I. ∙ Bultynck, G. ... The type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, emerging functions for an intriguing Ca 2+ -release channel BBA Mol. Cell Res. 2015; 1853 :1992-2005 PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that autophagy stimuli trigger various forms of Ca 2+ transients on the ER surface, which could be mediated by modulation of the activities of ER-localized Ca 2+ channels and pumps by various nutrient- and energy-sensing kinases ( Vanderheyden et al., 2009 48. Vanderheyden, V. ∙ Devogelaere, B. ∙ Missiaen, L. ... Regulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca 2+ release by reversible phosphorylation and dephosphorylation Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793 :959-970 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). The local Ca 2+ signal on an ER tubule triggered by autophagy stimuli can spread into a large area of the ER network but appears to be largely restricted at the ER-cytosol interface and does not cause evident global cytosolic Ca 2+ perturbations. The amplitude, frequency, and duration of Ca 2+ transients/oscillations on the ER are modulated by the metazoan-specific autophagy protein EPG-4/EI24. EI24 interacts with various Ca 2+ channels and pumps and is enriched at autophagic structures ( Figures S7 V–S7Y). The mechanism by which EI24 modulates ER Ca 2+ transients has yet to be determined.
Using a state-of-the-art multi-SIM system, we found that the initial FIP200 puncta triggered by autophagy stimuli are small and locate on or near the ER tubules. They associate with and move along the ER strand and enlarge via growth or fusion until they reach a certain size. FIP200 puncta on one or neighboring ER tubules organize into autophagosome initiation sites ( Figure 7 Q). Therefore, the sites where ER Ca 2+ transients are generated do not correspond to the autophagosome formation sites. During IM expansion, an ER fragment protrudes into the ring-like LC3 structure, eventually detaching from the ER and becoming engulfed by the autophagosome. The neck of the ER fragment could serve to transfer lipids from the ER to IMs.
The liquid-like properties of FIP200 puncta triggered by Ca 2+ transients indicate that their assembly is driven by LLPS, possibly mediated by multivalent intra- and inter-molecular interactions between ATG13 and FIP200. The location, frequency, amplitude, and duration of Ca 2+ transients, which determine assembly rate, stability, and size of FIP200 puncta and their distance from the ER, are essential for specifying autophagosome formation sites on the ER. In response to ER Ca 2+ transients induced by starvation, the FIP200 puncta are formed on or close to the ER. They attach to the ER and become stabilized by interacting with VAPs and ATLs. PI(3)P generated by the VPS34 complex also contributes to the association of FIP200 puncta with the ER ( Karanasios et al., 2013 19. Karanasios, E. ∙ Stapleton, E. ∙ Manifava, M. ... Dynamic association of the ULK1 complex with omegasomes during autophagy induction J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :5224-5238 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Persistent and large ER Ca 2+ transients/gradients, such as in EI24 KO cells, result in accumulation of ER-associated FIP200 puncta. Sudden cytosolic Ca 2+ transients distant from the ER induce formation of FIP200 puncta, which quickly enlarge by growth or coalescence, but fail to associate with the ER, and dissolve when the normal Ca 2+ level is restored. When instantaneous ER Ca 2+ transients are induced by various signals or ATP treatment, FIP200 puncta are not formed if the transient does not reach the threshold amplitude or duration; alternatively, puncta may form and then quickly dissolve due to rapid buffering of transients by Ca 2+ -binding proteins and re-uptake by Ca 2+ stores ( Burgoyne and Clague, 2003 4. Burgoyne, R.D. ∙ Clague, M.J. Calcium and calmodulin in membrane fusion Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641 :137-143 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). In starved IP3R2 KD cells, the global ER Ca 2+ transients/oscillations are attenuated, but abundant Ca 2+ transients still occur in multiple restricted areas of the ER and on lysosomes. The normal progression of autophagy in IP3R2 KD cells indicates that global ER Ca 2+ transients are not essential for autophagosome initiation. Lysosomal Ca 2+ release triggered by starvation can induce formation of FIP200 puncta directly or indirectly by evoking ER Ca 2+ transients to participate in autophagosome initiation.
FIP200 phase separation and spatial organization of FIP200 puncta on the ER is regulated by ATG9 vesicles. In ATG9 KO cells, multiple FIP200 puncta on spatially distinct ER tubules organize into complex spherical structures, which are interwoven with the ER strands. ATG9 vesicles may act directly to spatially organize ER-associated FIP200 puncta, or indirectly via their scramblase activity to modulate the ER organization. ATG9 interacts with FIP200, and therefore the highly dynamic nature of ATG9 vesicles could cause dispersal of FIP200. In response to Ca 2+ transients, formation of nascent FIP200 puncta is abolished in ATG9 KO cells, which is likely because the free FIP200 concentration is below the threshold for phase separation. Post-translational modifications of components of the FIP200 complex under starvation conditions may facilitate its LLPS in response to ER Ca 2+ transients and/or stabilize the initial FIP200 puncta. Temporal Ca 2+ dissipation mediated by SERCA/VMP1 is essential for dynamic disassembly of ER-IM contacts during IM expansion ( Zhao et al., 2017 54. Zhao, Y.G. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Miao, G. ...

Therefore, the Ca 2+ level at the ER-cytosol interface is tightly controlled to ensure the initiation, expansion, and closure of autophagosomes.
Upon autophagy induction in yeast, the Atg17/Atg13/Atg1 condensates assembled via LLPS are tethered to the vacuole via interaction with the vacuolar membrane protein Vac8, and the tethered condensates coalesce into one big punctum to form the PAS ( Fujioka et al., 2020 12. Fujioka, Y. ∙ Alam, J.M. ∙ Noshiro, D. ... Phase separation organizes the site of autophagosome formation Nature. 2020; 578 :301-305 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). The vacuole is the major intracellular Ca 2+ store in yeast: its free Ca 2+ concentration is ∼1.3 mM, which is more than 100-fold higher than the ER (∼10 μM). Ca 2+ is released from the vacuole in response to external stimuli ( Denis and Cyert, 2002 9. Denis, V. ∙ Cyert, M.S. Internal Ca 2+ release in yeast is triggered by hypertonic shock and mediated by a TRP channel homologue J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156 :29-34 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains to be determined whether autophagy stimuli trigger Ca 2+ release from the vacuole and induce LLPS of the Atg1 complex. If so, the involvement of different organelles in Ca 2+ storage and dynamics may be the underlying cause of the difference in spatial organization of autophagosome formation sites in yeast and multicellular organisms.
Our study has several limitations. It remains largely unknown how starvation triggers Ca 2+ transients on the ER outer surface, and how ER Ca 2+ transients trigger formation of FIP200 puncta. Both global and local Ca 2+ transients are greatly attenuated when the activities of RyRs and IP3Rs are deficient, but a few autophagosomes are still generated. It is possible that other Ca 2+ channels (e.g., TMCO1, presenilins, STIM-Orai, etc.) may compensate to induce small-amplitude, rapid, or highly localized ER Ca 2+ transients, but these are not detected by our multi-SIM analysis of the change of GCaMP6f-CYB5 fluorescence intensity. It is also technically challenging to make quantitative measurements of Ca 2+ gradients in the spatially restricted nanodomain at the ER-cytosol interface. In vitro reconstitution of the effect of Ca 2+ transients and ATG9 vesicles on LLPS of the FIP200 complex should be explored in the future. Nevertheless, our study provides insights into the underpinnings of the assembly of autophagosome formation sites on the ER in multicellular organisms.

The CYB5 transmembrane domain coding sequence is shown in Table S1 . jRGECO1a-CYB5 was constructed by replacing GCaMP6f from GCaMP6f-CYB5. pLenti-GCaMP6f-CYB5 was constructed by inserting GCaMP6f-CYB5 into lentivirus plasmid backbone.
Cells were transiently transfected with indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. For RNAi, cells were transfected with negative control (NC) or gene-specific siRNA oligos using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX, and collected 48 h or 72 h after transfection. The siRNA sequences used in this study are listed in Table S1 .
The KO cell lines were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system.

For generation of COS7 cells expressing ATG9-GFP, ATG101-GFP and ATG13-GFP, lentivirus was generated by transfection of HEK 293T cells with the plasmid encoding ATG9-GFP, ATG101-GFP and ATG13-GFP, and the psPA and pMD plasmids. Supernatant containing virus was collected 2 days after transfection, and filtered through a 0.22 μm polyethersulfone (PES) filter, aliquoted into single-use vials and stored at -80 °C. Polybrene was added into culture medium (final concentration 10 μg/mL) and mixed with the lentiviral aliquot. The cells were incubated with the virus for 48 hours before analysis.
For generation of GCaMP6f-CYB5 stable cell lines, the pLenti-EF1a-GCaMP6f-CYB5 plasmid, together with three packaging plasmids (pLP1(gag/pol), pLP2 (rev) and pLP/VSV-G (VSV-G envelope), were cotransfected into 293FT cells. After 48 hours, the supernatant (containing the viral particles) was harvested and clarified by centrifuging at 3200g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Clarified lentivirus supernatant was then added into cell culture medium containing 8 μg/mL polybrene. Cells were further cultured for 48 hours. Single-cell clones expressing GCaMP6f-CYB5 were then selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min, and then permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin (for LC3 staining) or 0.2% Triton (for other antibodies) for 20 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% goat serum for 1 h, cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies (diluted in 5% goat serum) overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3 times with PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescently-tagged secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with DAPI in 50% glycerol and imaged under a confocal microscope (LSM 880 Meta plus Zeiss Axiovert zoom, Zeiss) with a 63×/1.40 oil-immersion objective lens (Plan-Apochromatlan, Zeiss) and a camera (Axiocam HRm, Zeiss).
For co-IP assays, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h, and harvested with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail. After incubation on ice for 30-60 min, cells were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and incubated with GFP-Trap agarose beads with gentle rotation for 1-2 h at 4 °C. After washing 3 times with washing buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100), the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting.
For immunoblotting, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were boiled with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Proteins were detected using the indicated primary and secondary antibodies and the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was exposed using an imaging system (ChemiScope 6000 Touch; ClinX).
Cells cultured on glass-bottom dishes were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h. After washing 3 times with KHM buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.4), cells were treated with 25 μg/ml digitonin for 1 min at room temperature. Then 50 μg/ml proteinase K were added to the cells and live-cell images were captured by a confocal microscope.
COS7 cells were cultured as described above and transfected with the RUSH reporter SBP-GFP-CTSZ using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To release the RUSH reporters from the ER, 40 mM biotin in the presence of 100 mg/mL cycloheximide was added to the cultured cells at the indicated time. Images were acquired by a confocal microscope.
Exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation was performed by raising the Ca 2+ in the culture medium from 2 mM to 50 mM. To examine the formation of FIP200 in response to exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation, cells expressing GFP-FIP200 or its truncations were incubated in medium containing 50 mM CaCl 2 and images were acquired. The medium was changed back to normal growth medium containing 2 mM CaCl 2 and further images were acquired to monitor dissolution of puncta.
To determine whether the FIP200 condensates induced by exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation could be dissolved by 1,6-hexanediol, cells were cultured on 3.5-mm glass-bottom dishes and transfected with indicated plasmids for 24 h. After exogenous Ca 2+ stimulation for 5 min, cells were treated by 5% 1,6-hexanediol for 1 min during living-cell image acquisition. To examine FIP200 condensates induced by starvation, cells were cultured on coverslips in 24-well cell culture plates and treated by 5% 1,6-hexanediol for 1 min. After fixation with 4% PFA, cells were immunostained with anti-FIP200 and anti-LC3 antibodies as described above.
The HaloTag-LC3 assay was performed as previously described ( Takahashi et al., 2018 45. Takahashi, Y. ∙ He, H. ∙ Tang, Z. ... An autophagy assay reveals the ESCRT-III component CHMP2A as a regulator of phagophore closure Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2855 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were transfected with HaloTag-LC3 for 24 h and treated with 25 μg/ml digitonin in KHM buffer at 37 o C for 1 min. Then cells were incubated with membrane-impermeable ligand (MIL) HaloTag Alexa Fluor488 ligand at 37 o C for 15 min. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, and stained with membrane-permeable ligand (MPL) HaloTag TMR ligand for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with DAPI in 50% glycerol and examined by a confocal microscope.
Cells cultured on glass-bottom dishes were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h. FRAP experiments were performed on a confocal microscope. Defined regions were photobleached at 488 nm and the fluorescence intensities in these regions were collected every 2 s and normalized to the initial intensity before bleaching. Image intensity was measured by Mean ROI and further analyzed by GraphPad Prism. Data are shown as the fractional recovery, which refers to the fraction of the difference between the intensity before and immediately after bleaching.
FIP200 fragments (NTD, IDR and CTD) were PCR-amplified from GFP-FIP200 and inserted into pGEX-6P-1(GST) or pET-MBP-3C vector. The plasmid for bacterial expression of ATG13 (MBP-ATG13) was constructed by PCR-amplifying ATG13 from GFP-ATG13 and inserting the product into pET-MBP-3C. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) in LB medium at 18 °C and purified using Sepharose 4B beads (for GST-tagged protein) and Ni-NTA agarose beads (for MBP-tagged proteins). After desalination with desalting columns, proteins were eluted with desalting buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl) and assessed by SDS-PAGE.
GST-tagged proteins were incubated with 20 μl GST beads in 500 μl pulldown buffer (PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100), and then rotated gently at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 4 °C at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was removed. MBP-tagged proteins (50 μg) were incubated in 500 μl pulldown buffer and then added to the GST beads and rotated gently at 4 °C for 1 h. After four washes with pulldown buffer, the beads were boiled with SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis.
To detect interaction between endogenous FIP200 and ATG9, PLA experiments were performed as described previously ( Alam, 2018 1. Alam, M.S. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2018; 123 :e58 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, GFP-FIP200 (KI) cells were cultured and fixed as for normal immunostaining. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 according to the antibodies used. After blocking with Duolink blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing two times with 5% BSA in PBS, cells were incubated with PLA probes for 1 h at 37 o C. Ligation and amplification were performed to obtain the PLA signal. Images were taken as for normal immunostaining.
In situ calibration of GCaMP6f-CYB5 was performed as described ( Shang et al., 2014 43. Shang, W. ∙ Lu, F.J. ∙ Sun, T. ... Imaging Ca 2+ nanosparks in heart With a new targeted biosensor Circ. Res. 2014; 114 :412-420 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, COS7 cells expressing GCaMP6f-CYB5 were permeabilized with 50 μg/mL saponin for 30 seconds and then treated with internal solution (10 mM KOH, 100 mM aspartic acid, 20 mM KCl, 0.81 mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM Mg-ATP, 0.35 mM EGTA, 5 mM phosphocreatine di(tris), 10 mM phosphocreatine-Na, 5 mM creatine phosphokinase, 10 mM glutathione, 8% dextran, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) containing different concentrations of free Ca 2+ (0, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 2000, 10000 and 20000 nM). The Ca 2+ concentrations were calculated using Ca/Mg/ATP/EGTA Calculator v2.2b constants from NIST database #46 v8. The fluorescence of GCaMP6f-CYB5 was recorded with a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope with a 63×/1.40 NA oil-immersion objective. The excitation was 488 nm and emission was 490 to 550 nm. The F min (minimum biosensor fluorescence) was obtained using 3.5 mM EGTA internal solution. The F max (maximal fluorescence of the biosensor) was obtained using 20000 nM free Ca 2+ internal solution. GCaMP6f-CYB5 contrast factor was defined as the ratio of F max to F min . The relationship of Ca 2+ concentration (C) and normalized fluorescence (R) was fitted with the nonlinear equation R=F min + ( F max - F min )C n H /( K d nH +C n H ). nH is the Hill coefficient and K d is the dissociation constant. The Hill coefficient reflects the cooperativity of Ca 2+ binding with GCaMP6f-CYB5. The dissociation constant indicates the range of Ca 2+ concentrations measured by GCaMP6f-CYB5.
COS7 cells expressing GCaMP6f-CYB5 were preloaded with the cytosolic Ca 2+ indicator Rhod-4, then stimulated by 50 mM caffeine in Tyrode solution (137 mM NaCl, 15 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, 4.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl 2 , 1.2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 ) at pH 6.0, 7.2 and 9.0. Line scan analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope with a 63×/1.40 NA oil-immersion objective at 3.78 ms/line. The pinhole was set for a nominal 1 μm optical section. For simultaneous measurement of GCaMP6f-CYB5 and Rhod-4, excitation was at 488 and 543 nm, and emissions were collected at between 490 and 540 nm and >560 nm, respectively.
Red ER store Ca 2+ indicator (RCEPIAer) plasmid and GFP plasmid were cotransfected into cells at a 1:1 ratio. Fluorescence intensities of RCEPIAer and GFP were acquired under control conditions. The excitation and emission wavelengths of RCEPIAer were 564 nm and >590 nm respectively. After treatment with the indicated chemicals, fluorescence intensities of RCEPIAer and GFP were acquired again at the same laser power and excitation/emission range as for control conditions. The ratio of RCEPIAer/GFP under control conditions and under different treatment conditions was analyzed with GraphPad Prism.
Ratiometric single-cell cytosolic free Ca 2+ concentration imaging was performed on an IX-81 microscope (Olympus)-based system as described previously ( Zheng et al., 2013 59. Zheng, H.Y. ∙ Zhou, M.H. ∙ Hu, C.L. ... Differential roles of the C and N termini of Orai1 protein in interacting with stromal interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1) for Ca 2(+) release-activated Ca 2+ (CRAC) channel activation J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :11263-11272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). COS7 cells were incubated in DMEM containing 2 μM Fura-2-AM (F1221, ThermoFisher) at 37 °C for 30 minutes. Fura-2-loaded cells were then changed to 1.8 mM Ca 2+ Tyrode Solution. The exposure times at 340 nm and 380 nm were 100 ms. Images were acquired with Metafluor software (Universal Imaging) at intervals of 1 second for 2 minutes. The averaged 340/380 ratio was used as the basal cytosolic free Ca 2+ concentration. Cells were then changed to 0 Ca 2+ Tyrode Solution with 0.5 mM EGTA. Thapsigargin was added to this solution at a final concentration of 2 μM and the Fura-2 fluorescence was tracked. The ER Ca 2+ store was calculated as ΔF/F 0 , where F 0 was the basal fluorescence and ΔF was the maximal fluorescence minus basal fluorescence. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism and are expressed as means ± SEM.
Cells were cultured on glass-bottom dishes (801001, NEST). 24 h after transfection of the indicated plasmids, cells were cultured in the indicated medium and imaged at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 using a 100× objective (CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda, NA 1.45; Nikon) with immersion oil on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse Ti-E; Nikon) with a spinning-disk confocal scanner unit (UltraView; PerkinElmer). Images were taken every 2 s for 10 min. The images were analyzed with Volocity software (PerkinElmer).
Lysosome Ca 2+ release was measured as described previously ( Chen et al., 2021 6. Chen, D. ∙ Zheng, Q.X. ∙ Sun, L. ... ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 promotes lysosomal exocytosis-mediated viral egress Dev. Cell. 2021; 56 :3250-3263.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, LAMP1-GCaMP6f-transfected COS7 cells were rapidly changed from DMEM culture medium to HBSS by a perfusion system with a peristaltic pump. Time lapse images were acquired at 980 ms per frame and 1 s interval for 10 minutes before and after changing the medium.
The multi-SIM system integrates TIRF-SIM, grazing incidence (GI-SIM) ( Guo et al., 2018 15. Guo, Y.T. ∙ Li, D. ∙ Zhang, S.W. ... Visualizing intracellular organelle and cytoskeletal interactions at nanoscale resolution on millisecond timescales Cell. 2018; 175 :1430-1442.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 3D-SIM, as well as lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM). Nonlinear SIM achieves an optical resolution of 60.8 nm at a frame rate of more than 20 Hz. GI-SIM achieves an imaging speed of up to 684 Hz for 60,000 frames. This multi-modal SIM system allows us to select the optimum imaging mode for a specific process according to its subcellular location, dynamics, duration, etc. The NA of the multi-SIM lens is 1.49 (Nikon CFI SR HP Apo TIRF 100×/1.49 Oil objective lens).
For multi-SIM imaging experiments, COS7 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids or infected by lentivirus were seeded onto Mattek glass-bottomed dishes 18-24 hours prior to imaging. Cells transfected with HaloTag plasmids were labeled with 30 nM JF 646 ligand for 30 minutes (GA1121, Promega), and the cells were imaged immediately afterward. Cells were maintained in 37 °C and 5% CO 2 during imaging. Multi-SIM images were analyzed by Image J.
COS7 cells were transfected with the ER membrane-targeted genetically encoded Ca 2+ sensor GCaMP6f-CYB5 and plated in glass-bottomed dishes 18-24 h before imaging and measurement. Overexpression of GCaMP6f-CYB5 causes abnormal ER morphology. Stable cell lines with weak GCaMP6f-CYB5 expression were used for imaging. The live-cell imaging setup was stable and well-controlled in order to maintain the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 for GCaMP6f-CYB5 imaging. For Ca 2+ imaging by multi-SIM, lower laser power (half the dose used for normal short-term live-cell imaging) and shorter exposure time were used. The exposure time for each image was 10 ms, at a 1-second interval for 300 seconds. X and Y axial pixel size was 60.8 nm. Z axial pixel size was 270 nm. Images were processed by the WideField Deconvolution method. In this study, the GCaMP6f-CYB5 signal was analyzed for 300 seconds during the following periods as indicated in the figures: during the first 40 minutes of treatment; during 60-120 mins after treatment; and during 5 mins after addition of 50 μM BAPTA-AM. For data analysis, the regions with intensity transitions were cropped manually. The intensity-time curves were normalized by the intensity of the first image. The trace of GCaMP6f-CYB5 signal was normalized by the averaged initial baseline fluorescence of the whole focal plane F 0 . For analyzing Ca 2+ transient amplitude, baseline fluorescence (F 0 ) is subtracted from the peak fluorescence (F), then F-F 0 is normalized by the baseline value (F 0 ) to give the transient amplitude ΔF/F 0 = (F-F 0 )/F 0 . Both large-area Ca 2+ transients and local small-area Ca 2+ transients were counted. The transient number per focal plane and the amplitude (ΔF/F 0 ) were calculated and analyzed. Local gradual changes in the Ca 2+ gradient are technically challenging for quantitative measurement, and they were not analyzed in this study. Some of the large-area Ca 2+ signals are initiated by propagation of multiple small-area Ca 2+ signals, and these small signals are buried in the normalized trace of the whole focal plane.
For confocal Ca 2+ imaging, time-lapse imaging was performed on an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM880) with a 63×/1.40 NA oil-immersion objective and cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 during imaging. The excitation was 488 nm and emission was 490 to 660 nm. Images were acquired at 512×512 pixels, 1 s/frame and 60 frames/min. The XY axial pixel size was 0.264 μm. The areas with transients were selected and then the data were analyzed using custom-developed programs written in interactive data language (IDL Research Systems) as previously described ( Feng et al., 2019 11. Feng, G. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Li, J. ... Mitoflash biogenesis and its role in the autoregulation of mitochondrial proton electrochemical potential J. Gen. Physiol. 2019; 151 :727-737 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). For parametric quantification, we measured the GCaMP6f-CYB5 dynamic change (F/F 0 ), amplitude (ΔF/F 0 ), frequency of transients, and full duration at half maximum (FDHM) of each cell ( Lu et al., 2019 26. Lu, F.J. ∙ Sun, J.W. ∙ Zheng, Q.X. ... Imaging elemental events of store-operated Ca 2+ entry in invading cancer cells with plasmalemmal targeted sensors J. Cell Sci. 2019; 132 :jcs224923 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to multi-SIM, confocal analysis measures the fluorescence intensity of GCaMP6f-CYB5 in an entire cell or most of a cell at a lower resolution and scanning speed. Therefore, large periodic global or regional Ca 2+ transients on the ER outer surface were evident, while the local and fast Ca 2+ transients appeared as tiny spikes in the trace lines or even failed to be detected.
For spinning-disk confocal Ca 2+ imaging, GCaMP6f-CYB5 stable COS7 cells were plated in glass-bottomed dishes 18 h before imaging. Time-lapse imaging was performed with a 60×/1.45 NA oil-immersion objective and cells were maintained in 37 °C and 5% CO 2 during imaging. The excitation was 488 nm. The exposure time for each image was 300 ms. Images were acquired at every 1 second for 40 minutes. The XY axial pixel size was 0.117 μm. Each single whole cell was selected and then the traces of each cell were analyzed for F/F 0 , ΔF/F 0 , frequency of transients and FDHM. The frequency distribution histogram of the ER Ca 2+ transient amplitude, peak time (time at which the ER Ca 2+ transient occurred) and FDHM were plotted by Origin 2020b.
3D rendering was performed using IMARIS software (Bitplane, AG). For three-dimensional (3D) image processing, images were firstly deconvoluted by Huygens software. Then the image stacks were delivered into Imaris software to generate 3D reconstructions. The Imaris Surfaces tool was used to create a 3D rendering of each channel based on local intensities.
Image stacks containing 300 frames were normalized by the mean intensity of the first frame, then binned to one frame by maximum intensity. The 3D surface plot was then plotted by MATLAB.
Cells were harvested and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing two times with PBS and once in ddH 2 O, cells were post-fixed in 1% OsO 4 and 1.5% K 3 Fe(CN) 6 for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with ddH 2 O and placed in chilled 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with ddH 2 O, cells were further dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol solutions and embedded in epoxy EMBED-812 resin (14120, Electron Microscopy Sciences). A 120 kV electron microscope (Tecnai Spirit, FEI) was used at 100 kV. Images were acquired with an AMT CCD camera (MoradaG3; EMSIS) using RADIUS 2.2 software at room temperature.
All of the experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Co-IP and immunoblotting results are representatives of at least three independent experiments. For immunostaining, the cells or images were randomly selected for analysis. Graph plots and P-values were generated using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Origin2020b software was used to generate frequency distributions and to perform nonlinear fitting. Density of immunoblot bands and the immunofluorescence intensity of the images was quantified using Image J software (NIH Image). No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size, or to determine whether the data met the assumptions of the statistical approaches used. Statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test and the results are shown as mean±SEM. ns: no significant difference; ∗ : p<0.05; ∗∗ : p<0.01; ∗∗∗ : p<0.001. Statistical parameters including the definitions, exact values of n, what n represents, and statistical significance are reported in the Figures and corresponding Figure Legends.
