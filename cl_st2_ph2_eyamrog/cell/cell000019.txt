Title: In Situ Structure of an Intact Lipopolysaccharide-Bound Bacterial Surface Layer


Abstract: Summary

Most bacterial and all archaeal cells are encapsulated by a paracrystalline, protective, and cell-shape-determining proteinaceous surface layer (S-layer). On Gram-negative bacteria, S-layers are anchored to cells via lipopolysaccharide. Here, we report an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the Caulobacter crescentus S-layer bound to the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide. Using native mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations, we deduce the length of the O-antigen on cells and show how lipopolysaccharide binding and S-layer assembly is regulated by calcium. Finally, we present a near-atomic resolution in situ structure of the complete S-layer using cellular electron cryotomography, showing S-layer arrangement at the tip of the O-antigen. A complete atomic structure of the S-layer shows the power of cellular tomography for in situ structural biology and sheds light on a very abundant class of self-assembling molecules with important roles in prokaryotic physiology with marked potential for synthetic biology and surface-display applications.

Section: Introduction

Most bacterial and all archaeal cells are encapsulated by a paracrystalline, sheet-like, proteinaceous sheath known as a surface layer (or S-layer) ( Sára and Sleytr, 2000 50. Sára, M. ∙ Sleytr, U.B. S-Layer proteins J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 :859-868 Crossref Scopus (655) PubMed Google Scholar ). S-layers are made up of two-dimensional lattices built by repeated interactions between a special class of proteins called S-layer proteins ( Sleytr et al., 2014 57. Sleytr, U.B. ∙ Schuster, B. ∙ Egelseer, E.-M. ... S-layers: principles and applications FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38 :823-864 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to high-copy numbers of S-layer proteins in prokaryotic cells, it is estimated that S-layer proteins are the most abundant class of proteins on earth ( Pum et al., 2013 47. Pum, D. ∙ Toca-Herrera, J.L. ∙ Sleytr, U.B. S-layer protein self-assembly Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013; 14 :2484-2501 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). S-layers play critical roles in prokaryotic physiology, ranging from cell-shape determination to protection from predators and phages ( Sleytr et al., 2014 57. Sleytr, U.B. ∙ Schuster, B. ∙ Egelseer, E.-M. ... S-layers: principles and applications FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38 :823-864 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the first observation of S-layers over half a century ago ( Houwink, 1953 30. Houwink, A.L. A macromolecular mono-layer in the cell wall of Spirillum spec Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1953; 10 :360-366 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), structural biology information on S-layers has been scarce because of the inherent difficulty in studying these flexible two-dimensional arrays using the available structural biology techniques. Pioneering electron microscopy investigations have revealed the low-resolution organization of S-layer lattices ( Lupas et al., 1994; Smit et al., 1992; Sumper et al., 1990 39. Lupas, A. ∙ Engelhardt, H. ∙ Peters, J. ... Domain structure of the Acetogenium kivui surface layer revealed by electron crystallography and sequence analysis J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176 :1224-1233 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Smit, J. ∙ Engelhardt, H. ∙ Volker, S. ... The S-layer of Caulobacter crescentus : three-dimensional image reconstruction and structure analysis by electron microscopy J.

Primary structure and glycosylation of the S-layer protein of Haloferax volcanii J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172 :7111-7118 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, only a few atomic structures of purified S-layer domains have been reported thus far ( Arbing et al., 2012; Baranova et al., 2012; Bharat et al., 2017 4. Arbing, M.A. ∙ Chan, S. ∙ Shin, A. ... Structure of the surface layer of the methanogenic archaean Methanosarcina acetivorans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Even less is known at the atomic level about how S-layers are anchored and assembled on cells. In archaeal cells, S-layers are often directly bound to the cell membrane ( Albers and Meyer, 2011 3. Albers, S.V. ∙ Meyer, B.H. The archaeal cell envelope Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9 :414-426 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Gram-positive bacterial S-layers are buried in the cell wall ( Fagan and Fairweather, 2014; Sára and Sleytr, 2000 23. Fagan, R.P. ∙ Fairweather, N.F. Biogenesis and functions of bacterial S-layers Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12 :211-222 Crossref Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Sára, M. ∙ Sleytr, U.B. S-Layer proteins J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 :859-868 Crossref Scopus (655) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Gram-negative bacteria such as Caulobacter crescentus or Campylobacter fetus , S-layers are retained on cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin molecules present in the outer membrane (OM) ( Fagan and Fairweather, 2014; Sára and Sleytr, 2000 23. Fagan, R.P. ∙ Fairweather, N.F. Biogenesis and functions of bacterial S-layers Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12 :211-222 Crossref Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Sára, M. ∙ Sleytr, U.B. S-Layer proteins J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 :859-868 Crossref Scopus (655) PubMed Google Scholar ). LPS of Gram-negative bacteria is an abundant glycolipid responsible for bacterial recognition by foreign agents such as the human immune system or bacteriophages. LPS consists of lipid A, core oligosaccharides (OSs), and a repetitive O-antigen polysaccharide (PS) ( Cabeen et al., 2010 14. Cabeen, M.T. ∙ Murolo, M.A. ∙ Briegel, A. ... Mutations in the Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway interfere with crescentin-mediated cell curvature in Caulobacter crescentus J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192 :3368-3378 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent structural studies on the LPS have focused on O-antigen secretion through the inner membrane ( Bi et al., 2018; Caffalette et al., 2019 11. Bi, Y. ∙ Mann, E. ∙ Whitfield, C. ... Architecture of a channel-forming O-antigen polysaccharide ABC transporter Nature. 2018; 553 :361-365 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar 15.

Commun. 2019; 10 :824 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), LPS transport across the periplasm ( Li et al., 2019; Owens et al., 2019 38. Li, Y. ∙ Orlando, B.J. ∙ Liao, M. Structural basis of lipopolysaccharide extraction by the LptB 2 FGC complex Nature. 2019; 567 :486-490 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Owens, T.W. ∙ Taylor, R.J. ∙ Pahil, K.S. ... Structural basis of unidirectional export of lipopolysaccharide to the cell surface Nature. 2019; 567 :550-553 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ), and its subsequent secretion through the OM ( Dong et al., 2014; Qiao et al., 2014 20. Dong, H. ∙ Xiang, Q. ∙ Gu, Y. ... Structural basis for outer membrane lipopolysaccharide insertion Nature. 2014; 511 :52-56 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Qiao, S. ∙ Luo, Q. ∙ Zhao, Y. ... Structural basis for lipopolysaccharide insertion in the bacterial outer membrane Nature. 2014; 511 :108-111 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, there is limited information on O-antigen structure ( Steinbacher et al., 1996 60. Steinbacher, S. ∙ Baxa, U. ∙ Miller, S. ... Crystal structure of phage P22 tailspike protein complexed with Salmonella sp. O-antigen receptors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93 :10584-10588 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ); therefore, its native arrangement and conformation on cells remains enigmatic.
To study the structure, anchoring, and assembly of S-layers on LPS molecules in the OM of Gram-negative bacteria, we turned to C. crescentus , a well-studied model bacterium with a complex life cycle ( Poindexter, 1964 46. Poindexter, J.S. Biological properties and classification of the Caulobacter group Bacteriol. Rev. 1964; 28 :231-295 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The S-layer of C. crescentus is composed of a single, 1026-amino-acid-residue, multi-domain, S-layer protein called RsaA ( Smit et al., 1992 58. Smit, J. ∙ Engelhardt, H. ∙ Volker, S. ... The S-layer of Caulobacter crescentus : three-dimensional image reconstruction and structure analysis by electron microscopy J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174 :6527-6538 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). We have recently reported the X-ray structure of the C-terminal domain of RsaA (RsaA CTD ), consisting of residues 250–1026, which form the highly interconnected outer S-layer lattice ( Bharat et al., 2017 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the structure of the N-terminal domain of RsaA (RsaA NTD ), consisting of residues 1–249, which is a putative LPS-binding domain directly proximal to the OM ( Bharat et al., 2017; Ford et al., 2007 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Ford, M.J. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ∙ Smit, J. S-layer anchoring and localization of an S-layer-associated protease in Caulobacter crescentus J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :2226-2237 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), is as yet unreported. Therefore, how RsaA is tethered to cells via LPS molecules and the native structure and conformation of LPS on cells beneath the S-layer are all unknown.
Here in this study, we have solved the missing structure of the RsaA NTD bound to the O-antigen of the LPS using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Using native mass spectrometry (MS), we studied the calcium (Ca 2+ ) dependence and stoichiometry of sugar binding to RsaA, allowing us to estimate the length of the native O-antigen and understand the architecture of the cellular LPS. Next, molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations combined with electron cryotomography (cryo-ET) allowed us to probe the assembly mechanism of the S-layer on cells. Finally, we used advanced subtomogram averaging techniques to resolve a near-atomic resolution structure of the cellular S-layer, providing unprecedented insights into the S-layer and LPS structure at the C. crescentus cell surface. In summary, we report an atomic-level structure of the complete cellular S-layer bound to LPS and multiple Ca 2+ ions as it is found on the surface of bacterial cells, providing detailed information on S-layer organization and assembly on LPS.

Section: Results

To investigate cellular anchoring of RsaA on LPS, we reconstituted RsaA binding to LPS in vitro and studied the assembled complex using single-particle cryo-EM. A mutant C. crescentus strain that carried a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site between RsaA NTD and RsaA CTD after position 250 was used to purify RsaA NTD ( STAR Methods ). Purified RsaA NTD was primarily monomeric in solution and appeared as small particles on cryo-EM grids ( Figures S1 A and S1D). Next, we purified the C. crescentus LPS from a mutant strain that lacked rsaA and added it to RsaA NTD . Large oligomers of RsaA NTD were formed around aggregates of crude LPS ( Figures S1 B, S1D, and S1E). To separate RsaA NTD bound to LPS aggregates into homogeneous single particles, we pretreated the purified crude LPS with acetic acid to cleave off lipid A ( Jones et al., 2015 34. Jones, M.D. ∙ Vinogradov, E. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ... The core and O-polysaccharide structure of the Caulobacter crescentus lipopolysaccharide Carbohydr. Res. 2015; 402 :111-117 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), yielding partially cleaved PS. On addition of this PS to RsaA NTD , an oligomeric complex of approximately 650 kDa was obtained, which appeared as separated single particles on cryo-EM grids ( Figures S1 C, S1D, and S1F). Different views of the complex were observed, and top views of the complex were reminiscent of the inner domain of the C. crescentus S-layer on cells ( Figure 1 A) ( Bharat et al., 2017; Smit et al., 1992 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Smit, J. ∙ Engelhardt, H. ∙ Volker, S. ... The S-layer of Caulobacter crescentus : three-dimensional image reconstruction and structure analysis by electron microscopy J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174 :6527-6538 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We resolved a density map of the RsaA NTD :PS complex at 3.7 Å resolution using single-particle cryo-EM techniques ( Scheres, 2012 51. Scheres, S.H.W. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ). All secondary structure elements and amino acid side chains were unambiguously assigned, and no significant resolution anisotropy was observed within each RsaA NTD monomer in the cryo-EM map ( Figure S2 ). We used the cryo-EM map to build an atomic model of RsaA NTD along with the bound PS ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S2 ; Video S1 ; Table S1 ). In the complex, several copies of RsaA NTD are arranged in a spiral, which is held together along its length by seven chains of PS. Density for the main PS chain of the O-antigen is well resolved ( Figure 1 D) and agrees with the sequence and linkages reported for C. crescentus LPS ( Jones et al., 2015 34. Jones, M.D. ∙ Vinogradov, E. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ... The core and O-polysaccharide structure of the Caulobacter crescentus lipopolysaccharide Carbohydr. Res. 2015; 402 :111-117 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). The O-antigen repeating unit is tightly bound to RsaA NTD with several interacting amino acid residues along the length of the protein ( Figure 1 E). The O-antigen binding pocket is stabilized by functional Ca 2+ ions that are tightly coordinated to aspartic acid residues in RsaA NTD ( Figure 1 F), suggesting that Ca 2+ ions are important for RsaA NTD :PS complex assembly.

Cryo-EM Structure of the RsaA NTD :PS Complex at 3.7 Å Resolution, Related to Figure 1 The reconstructed 3.7 Å resolution cryo-EM density of RsaA NTD :PS complex contoured at 5 σ is shown. Individual RsaA NTD subunits are colored in different shades of gray. The O-antigen (orange) is well resolved and forms a connecting density between the successive turns of the spiral-like structure. The de novo built atomic model of a single RsaA NTD subunit is fitted into the cryo-EM density where side chains are unambiguously assigned.
To further explore whether Ca 2+ ions influenced the assembly of the RsaA NTD :PS complex, we performed a desalting step to remove Ca 2+ ions. Native MS ( Gault et al., 2016 25. Gault, J. ∙ Donlan, J.A.C. ∙ Liko, I. ... High-resolution mass spectrometry of small molecules bound to membrane proteins Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :333-336 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ) of the resulting sample showed that the RsaA NTD :PS complex dissociated into monomers, dimers, and tetramers of RsaA NTD upon Ca 2+ removal ( Figures 2 and S3 ). Complex dissociation was reversible, and addition of Ca 2+ resulted in complex reassembly ( Figure S3 B). This process of complex disassembly and reassembly could be repeated multiple times ( Figure S3 C). In the case of the original, assembled RsaA NTD :PS complex, native MS showed a series of peaks corresponding to RsaA NTD monomers and dimers, both associated with LPS ( Figure 2 A), as well as a series of peaks at m/z ∼12,000, which were difficult to assign ( Figure 2 A). Tandem MS indicated that this complex consisted of two oligomeric states, predominantly a RsaA NTD 21-mer, together with a 20-mer. Both oligomers bound preferentially to one unit of PS and six units of full LPS ( Figure 2 A; Table 1 ). Although we cannot rule out other PS or LPS stoichiometries, this species predominates and is validated by the cryo-EM reconstruction of the complex that showed seven sugar chains bound to 20 or 21 copies of RsaA NTD . In line with the strong tendency to oligomerize observed in native MS, the cryo-EM structure additionally shows an extensive RsaA NTD :RsaA NTD oligomerization interface in the complex. This interface is formed by salt bridges between adjoining RsaA NTD subunits. This binding interface is repeated around the spiral ( Figures S3 D–S3F), likely stabilizing the oligomeric complex.
Next, we examined the biochemical basis for the O-antigen and RsaA NTD interaction observed in our cryo-EM structure. The repeating unit of the C. crescentus O-antigen contains six hexose moieties in the main PS chain: N-acetyl perosamine(PerNac)-PerNac-mannose(Man)-PerNac-PerNac-Man, with a branching 3-O-methyl glucose (Glc) on every sixth position ( Jones et al., 2015 34. Jones, M.D. ∙ Vinogradov, E. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ... The core and O-polysaccharide structure of the Caulobacter crescentus lipopolysaccharide Carbohydr. Res. 2015; 402 :111-117 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the main PS chain was easily traceable in our map, the position of the branching Glc moiety bound to every sixth Man moiety was not immediately obvious. To help assign the position of the branching Glc in our cryo-EM map, we subjected monomeric RsaA NTD with two repeats of the O-antigen resolved in our structure to MD simulations. Simulations in the absence of branching Glc moieties showed large root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) for both the sugar and the protein atoms ( Figures 3 A, 3 D, and S4 ). On the inclusion of the Glc moiety in positions 3 and 9, these fluctuations were dramatically reduced and showed the core of the repeating sugar locked to its binding pocket within the RsaA NTD fold ( Figures 3 B and 3E). Surprisingly, a parallel simulation with Glc in positions 6 and 12 showed the same result ( Figures 3 C and 3F), suggesting that there might be two distinct ways that the O-antigen can bind to RsaA NTD ( Video S2 ). To verify this prediction from simulations with orthogonal evidence, we reinspected our cryo-EM map at lower isosurface contour levels ( Figures 3 G–3I), where we observed density for Glc at every third position, confirming that both states are present in our cryo-EM data and that the structure we resolved likely contains an average of both states, with seven PS chains bound in different registers to the RsaA NTD spiral.

MD Simulations of Monomeric RsaA NTD in Complex with Different Branched O-Antigen, Related to Figure 3 MD simulations (100 ns) of monomeric RsaA NTD (blue) in complex with the O-antigen (orange) unbranched (left) or with Glc (yellow) at positions 3 and 9 (middle) or positions 6 and 12 (right).
Another noteworthy observation from the MD simulations was that all three Ca 2+ ions in the structure remain tightly and stably bound to RsaA NTD throughout the simulations, consistent with our biochemical and native MS data ( Figure 2 ). In fact, the entire Ca 2+ -binding loop consisting of RsaA amino acid residues 77–100 were significantly stabilized when the branching Glc moieties of the O-antigen were included in the simulations ( Figures S4 J–S4L), suggesting that Ca 2+ and LPS binding are linked with each other ( Figure S4 M) and augment complex assembly in a cooperative manner.
Next, we tested whether our in vitro results could be replicated on cells. A density for both RsaA NTD as well as RsaA CTD is seen in raw electron cryotomograms of C. crescentus cell stalks ( Figure 4 A) and also in subtomogram averages produced from the surface of these stalks ( Figure 4 B). Density layers for RsaA domains are absent in a Δ rsaA mutant, which does not possess an S-layer ( Figures 4 C and 4D). To test whether RsaA NTD would also bind to cellular LPS, we added purified RsaA NTD to Δ rsaA cells. Instead of forming a single layer of density outside the OM like the native S-layer, we observed three density layers proximal to the OM ( Figures 4 E and 4F). These density layers had the same appearance and spacing as those seen in side views of our cryo-EM structure of the RsaA NTD :PS complex ( Figure 4 F, inset). This showed that not only can RsaA NTD bind to cellular LPS but also that binding occurs all along the LPS O-antigen due to its repeating nature. Similar results were obtained on the addition of full-length RsaA, where three density layers were observed on top of a RsaA CTD layer ( Figure S5 ). Also consistent with our biochemical data, when Ca 2+ ions were depleted from the reaction by the addition of EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)- N , N , N ′, N ′-tetraacetic acid) and RsaA NTD was added to Δ rsaA cells ( Figure S5 H), no S-layer assembly or decoration of the cellular LPS in the OM was observed, in line with the desalting experiments conducted in native MS.
In light of these in situ results, together with the stoichiometry of the RsaA NTD :PS complex observed in cryo-EM and confirmed by native MS in which 20 or 21 monomers of RsaA NTD were observed in the complex bound to seven O-antigen molecules, we predict using the total mass of the complex that the full RsaA NTD spiral would bind on average 294 hexose moieties, which allows us to calculate that there are 42 hexose moieties in the cellular O-antigen of the native C. crescentus . This calculation is also consistent with the distances measured between the OM and the S-layer in our cryo-ET data ( Figure 4 ), accounting for the size of the core OS proximal to the OM.
To obtain a more detailed view of the cellular S-layer, we used recently described subtomogram averaging algorithms ( Turoňová et al., 2017 62. Turoňová, B. ∙ Schur, F.K.M. ∙ Wan, W. ... Efficient 3D-CTF correction for cryo-electron tomography using NovaCTF improves subtomogram averaging resolution to 3.4Å J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 199 :187-195 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ) to obtain a 4.8 Å resolution structure of the S-layer lattice directly on the surface of cell stalks ( Figure S6 ). The subtomogram averaging map shows large anisotropy in resolution, with the resolution highest in RsaA NTD , close to the 6-fold symmetrization axis ( Figure S6 B). Both the RsaA NTD cryo-EM structure as well as the RsaA CTD X-ray structure ( Bharat et al., 2017 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ) could be docked into the cryo-ET density unambiguously as rigid bodies ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Video S3 ). All α helices of RsaA NTD are resolved in the cryo-ET map ( Figure 5 C), and large side chains are resolved, which fit the density well without any further refinement ( Figure 5 D). Satisfyingly, a clear density for the O-antigen of the LPS is observed in the same relative location as in the single-particle cryo-EM map of the RsaA NTD :PS complex ( Figure 5 E). It is worth mentioning that the RsaA NTD :RsaA NTD interface is almost unchanged from the interaction observed in the RsaA NTD :PS spiral complex ( Figures 1 and S3 D–S3F). This observation suggests that the planar hexameric arrangement of RsaA NTD in the native S-layer is at least partially imposed by the hexagonal symmetry of the RsaA CTD outer lattice.

In Situ Cryo-ET Reconstruction of the Native C. crescentus S-Layer at 4.8 Å Resolution, Related to Figure 5 The 4.8 Å cryo-ET map of the native C. crescentus S-layer (gray) contoured at 3 σ away from the mean is shown with the docked 2.7 Å X-ray structure (PDB: 5N8P) of RsaA CTD (red). A side view of the structure highlights the RsaA NTD (blue). A close-up view of RsaA NTD shows clear density corresponding to the bound O-antigen. Decreased contour level (0.5 σ) of the cryo-ET map shows that densities of O-antigen bound to RsaA extending downwards toward the OM of the bacterial cell.
There are very few contact sites observed between RsaA NTD and RsaA CTD ( Video S4 ), showing why the two domains can oligomerize independently. The two domains are connected by a short linker region, which appears as a smeared density in the cryo-ET map, suggesting some flexibility ( Figures S6 D–S6F; Video S4 ). The density for the LPS O-antigen is clearly resolved near the RsaA NTD domain, and this density ends within the RsaA NTD layer and does not extend outward to the RsaA CTD ( Figure 5 G). This indicates that upon secretion and assembly into an S-layer, RsaA proteins localize at the very tip of the O-antigen. These observations are consistent with the fact that antibodies against the O-antigen are unable to stain the O-antigen when the S-layer is present ( Walker et al., 1994 63. Walker, S.G. ∙ Karunaratne, D.N. ∙ Ravenscroft, N. ... Characterization of mutants of Caulobacter crescentus defective in surface attachment of the paracrystalline surface layer J.

Ca 2+ Ion Stabilization and LPS Tethering of Native C. crescentus S-Layer, Related to Figure 5 The outer domain of RsaA (RsaA CTD , red) is plotted as a hexagonal lattice determined by subtomogram averaging of the native C. crescentus S-layer. A closeup view of the Ca 2+ dependent outer lattice highlights the dimeric and trimeric interfaces of individual subunits forming the S-layer. A side view of the structure with the RsaA NTD (blue) bound to the O-antigen of LPS, which is stabilized by a Ca 2+ dependent loop region proximal to the sugar binding site. The RsaA NTD and RsaA CTD domains are connected by a small linker region near residue Pro 243 of the solved 3.7 Å cryo-EM structure and residue Gly 249 of the 2.7 Å X-ray structure (Bharat et al., 2017).
In the other direction toward the cell, at low contour levels, the O-antigen density extends down toward the OM and is probably formed of flexible and fluctuating O-antigen repeats connected to the core OS ( Figure 5 F; Video S5 ). The relative distance between the S-layer and the OM remains constant over the cell body and stalks ( Figure S7 ), showing that the length of the LPS O-antigen is the same all around the cell. Furthermore, the S-layer arrangement including the near-hexagonal symmetry is also seen over the cell body ( Figure S7 ). Therefore, the near-atomic resolution in situ structure of the C. crescentus S-layer allows positioning of not only the two RsaA domains but also the O-antigen of LPS relative to the OM of the bacterial cell ( Figure 5 H), providing an atomic resolution snapshot of the outermost layer of C. crescentus bacteria made up of protein and polysaccharide.

High-Resolution In Situ Structure of the C. crescentus S-layer Plotted on the Cells, Related to Figures 5 and 6 Sequential Z-slices through a tomogram of a C. crescentus cell illustrating the cellular morphology (yellow annotation). Sub-tomogram averaging of the S-layer on the cell stalks yielded a 4.8 Å map of the native S-layer as well as the cellular localisation of the repeating hexameric units on the OM. A close up view of a single hexameric S-layer unit with fits of the atomic structures of the RsaA CTD (2.7 Å X-ray structure, red) and RsaA NTD (3.7 Å cryo-EM, blue) into the in situ cryo-ET map (4.8 Å sub-tomogram averaging, gray) contoured at 3 σ away from the mean. The O-antigen binding site of the RsaA NTD :PS structure is present in the native S-layer and the density corresponding to the O-antigen is resolved. At lower isosurface contour levels (3–0.5 σ) densities emanating from the S-layer toward the OM are clearly seen.

Section: Discussion

One of the outstanding goals of structural biology is to resolve atomic resolution cellular structures and to study cellular processes in atomic detail in situ . To this end on the technical side, this study demonstrates how cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging (4.8 Å cellular S-layer) is closing the gap to single-particle cryo-EM (3.7 Å RsaA NTD :PS complex) and X-ray crystallography (2.7 Å RsaA CTD ). Modern cryo-ET imaging can provide molecular resolution insights into the architecture and organization of cells ( Chang et al., 2016; Mahamid et al., 2016 16. Chang, Y.-W. ∙ Rettberg, L.A. ∙ Treuner-Lange, A. ... Architecture of the type IVa pilus machine Science. 2016; 351 :aad2001 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Mahamid, J. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ∙ Schaffer, M. ... Visualizing the molecular sociology at the HeLa cell nuclear periphery Science. 2016; 351 :969-972 Crossref Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we used cryo-ET combined with subtomogram averaging to reveal a repeated cellular structure at near-atomic resolution, allowing the fundamental biological process of S-layer assembly to be studied directly in its cellular context ( Figure 5 H).
Our structure of the complete C. crescentus S-layer, together with the O-antigen of the LPS, is a potential target for synthetic biology applications, in which tagged S-layers could be used to link genotype to protein displayed at high copy numbers on surfaces. The first such technical application, developed using the X-ray structure of RsaA CTD has been recently reported ( Charrier et al., 2019 17. Charrier, M. ∙ Li, D. ∙ Mann, V. ... Engineering the S-layer of Caulobacter crescentus as a Foundation for Stable, High-Density, 2D Living Materials ACS Synth. Biol. 2019; 8 :181-190 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our structure of the RsaA NTD :PS complex confirms previous studies that showed that the N-terminal residues of RsaA are critical for S-layer anchoring ( Ford et al., 2007 24. Ford, M.J. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ∙ Smit, J. S-layer anchoring and localization of an S-layer-associated protease in Caulobacter crescentus J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :2226-2237 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). A majority of the mutations in RsaA NTD , including amino acid exchanges or insertions before position 225 in the amino acid sequence, lead to complete loss of S-layer anchoring ( Ford et al., 2007 24. Ford, M.J. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ∙ Smit, J. S-layer anchoring and localization of an S-layer-associated protease in Caulobacter crescentus J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :2226-2237 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with the extensive interaction observed between the O-antigen and RsaA NTD in our cryo-EM structure ( Figures S4 A–S4C). Our integrated structural biology approach has technical implications to the future structural studies of LPS. LPS is nearly ubiquitous in Gram-negative bacteria, and it is found in several important human pathogens. LPS assembly and biogenesis has thus rightly been the focus of several prominent structural biology efforts in the recent past, for example Bi et al., 2018 11. Bi, Y. ∙ Mann, E. ∙ Whitfield, C. ... Architecture of a channel-forming O-antigen polysaccharide ABC transporter Nature. 2018; 553 :361-365 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar and Caffalette et al., 2019 15. Caffalette, C.A. ∙ Corey, R.A. ∙ Sansom, M.S.P. ... A lipid gating mechanism for the channel-forming O antigen ABC transporter Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :824 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar , to name a few. Here we show that by combining cryo-EM and cryo-ET with native MS, it is possible to understand not only the biochemistry but also the cellular architecture and arrangement of LPS, revealing how LPS molecules are located in the space directly outside Gram-negative C. crescentus cells. Using a similar integrated approach of combining EM with MS, LPS molecules in other bacteria may be studied, allowing molecular details of this enigmatic molecule to be revealed.
In C. crescentus , future genetic and biochemical studies that mutate and perturb the LPS O-antigen might shed light onto how LPS biogenesis and secretion is coupled with S-layer assembly. Only density for the LPS O-antigen bound to RsaA NTD was resolved in our cryo-EM map; therefore it is still not completely clear how the core oligosaccharide and lipid A of the LPS is arranged on cells. Further structural and cell biology studies in the C. crescentus system will be required to understand how the LPS is anchored at the other end, away from the S-layer by the bacterial OM.
It is reasonable to expect that newly secreted RsaA proteins might be guided toward the S-layer lattice along O-antigen chains via binding to RsaA NTD ( Figure 6 ). O-antigen binding is Ca 2+ dependent ( Video S4 ), and Ca 2+ levels are higher in the extracellular space ( Baines et al., 2000; Jeziorski et al., 2008 5. Baines, S.B. ∙ Webster, K.E. ∙ Kratz, T.K. ... Synchronous behavior of temperature, calcium, and chlorophyll in lakes of northern Wisconsin Ecology. 2000; 81 :815-825 Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar 32. Jeziorski, A. ∙ Yan, N.D. ∙ Paterson, A.M. ... The widespread threat of calcium decline in fresh waters Science. 2008; 322 :1374-1377 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ), enough to trigger spontaneous S-layer assembly ( Herrmann et al., 2017 29. Herrmann, J. ∙ Jabbarpour, F. ∙ Bargar, P.G. ... Environmental Calcium Controls Alternate Physical States of the Caulobacter Surface Layer Biophys. J. 2017; 112 :1841-1851 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). RsaA NTD can bind along the entire length of the O-antigen of the cellular LPS ( Figures 6 B and S5 ), consistent with the multiple binding modes observed in our cryo-EM structure and confirmed by MD simulations. When full-length RsaA was added to a C. crescentus strain lacking an S-layer, formation of an additional (fourth) density layer at the same distance from the OM as the native RsaA CTD layer was observed, suggesting that RsaA molecules bound at the ends of the LPS had at least partially assembled into an S-layer lattice. This indicates that lattice assembly is only possible when RsaA is bound at the tip of the O-antigen, implying that a meshwork of LPS and other molecules might sterically hinder premature S-layer formation.
RsaA NTD domains in the assembled S-layer are attached to the end of the LPS ( Figure 6 C), and RsaA CTD domains oligomerise in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner to form the outer S-layer lattice ( Figures 6 C and 5 H; Video S5 ). Overall, both RsaA NTD and RsaA CTD contain several functionally important Ca 2+ ions, which have roles in LPS binding as well as lattice assembly. Consistent with this strong Ca 2+ dependence, cooperative assembly is observed in both RsaA domains, allowing this remarkable two-dimensional array to be assembled on the surface of C. crescentus cells ( Figure 6 D). It is interesting to note that Ca 2+ -dependence has been previously described for other unrelated S-layers from Gram-positive bacteria ( Baranova et al., 2012 6. Baranova, E. ∙ Fronzes, R. ∙ Garcia-Pino, A. ... SbsB structure and lattice reconstruction unveil Ca2+ triggered S-layer assembly Nature. 2012; 487 :119-122 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ) and archaea ( Sumper et al., 1990 61. Sumper, M. ∙ Berg, E. ∙ Mengele, R. ... Primary structure and glycosylation of the S-layer protein of Haloferax volcanii J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172 :7111-7118 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), perhaps suggesting similar mechanisms of assembly. However, further work will be needed to verify this expectation. In the case of the C. crescentus S-layer, it is remarkable how division of labor between different RsaA domains, where RsaA NTD mediates cell anchoring and RsaA CTD forms the lattice layer, allows this remarkable polyprotein to perform multiple tasks on the cell surface to form micron-scale, two-dimensional sheaths on membranes with variable curvature.
Finally, fluorescently tagged S-layers derived from our structure will open the door to studying S-layer dynamics ( Charrier et al., 2019; Comerci et al., 2019 17. Charrier, M. ∙ Li, D. ∙ Mann, V. ... Engineering the S-layer of Caulobacter crescentus as a Foundation for Stable, High-Density, 2D Living Materials ACS Synth. Biol. 2019; 8 :181-190 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar 18. Comerci, C.J. ∙ Herrmann, J. ∙ Yoon, J. ... Topologically-guided continuous protein crystallization controls bacterial surface layer self-assembly Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2731 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) with respect to the cell cycle and cell morphogenesis. A recent optical microscopy study on the same system has shown that a new C. crescentus S-layer is inserted at the mid-cell or at the cell poles ( Comerci et al., 2019 18. Comerci, C.J. ∙ Herrmann, J. ∙ Yoon, J. ... Topologically-guided continuous protein crystallization controls bacterial surface layer self-assembly Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2731 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the light of this spatiotemporal regulation of S-layer morphogenesis, it seems remarkable how molecular rearrangements within the cell control biogenesis and assembly of a two-dimensional lattice 180 Å away from the OM, mediated by long rope-like LPS molecules. Future structural and cell biology studies on this system will reveal how S-layer morphogenesis is coupled with critical cellular processes such as cell elongation, peptidoglycan synthesis, LPS biogenesis, LPS secretion, and cell division, providing insights into the mechanism of how spatial information is relayed from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment of the cell.

All C. crescentus strains listed in this study are listed in the Key Resources table. C. crescentus strains were grown in peptone-yeast-extract (PYE) medium ( Poindexter, 1964 46. Poindexter, J.S. Biological properties and classification of the Caulobacter group Bacteriol. Rev. 1964; 28 :231-295 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) at 30°C, with antibiotic and carbon supplements at the following concentrations when necessary: kanamycin (5 μg/mL (plate), 5 μg/mL (broth)), nalidixic acid (20 μg/mL (plate)). Escherichia coli strains were cultured at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. LB medium was supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg/mL or 25 μg/mL (plate)) when necessary. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are further listed in Table S2 .
All primers used in this study are listed in Table S2 and were purchased from Eurofins Genomics (Louisville, KY). PCR products were generated using iProoF Hi-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Biorad, Hercules, CA) and purified using Qiaquick spin columns (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) following procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Chromosomal DNA was isolated using Promega Magic MiniPrep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI) using the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by Eurofins Genomics. Sequence data were analyzed using Sequencher 5.4.6 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).
The TEV protease mutants were generated by homologous recombination using upstream and downstream fragments of rsaA cloned into a non-replicating plasmid pNPTS138, which carries a kanamycin resistance gene cassette ( nptI ), along with the sacB cassette that confers sucrose sensitivity as previously described ( Gonin et al., 2000 26.

The TEV protease site (Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-:-Gly) was engineered at amino acid 250 of RsaA. An upstream ∼2000 bp PCR fragment that contained 1000 bp of upstream DNA and the first 749 bp (250 aa) of rsaA was generated using primers, 138rsaA1kbupF and rsaATEV250upR. The downstream ∼2600 bp PCR product that contained the remainder of rsaA from 750 to 3080 bp (amino acid residues 251 to 1026) and an additional 500 bp of downstream DNA was created with primers, rsaATEV250dwnF and 138rsaA500dwnR. Gibson Assembly with NEBuilder HiFi Assembly mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA) was used to assemble the two PCR products and pNPTS138 digested with EcoRV and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The Gibson Assembly reaction was transformed into alpha select silver chemically competent cells (Bioline, Swedesboro, NJ) and selected on LB supplemented with kanamycin. Transformants were screened by PCR using M13F, M13R and TEVprimerF and confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid (pNPTS138::3 rsaA TEV250) was transformed into S17-1, mated into NA1000 Δ rsaA and selected on PYE with nalidixic acid and kanamycin. The additional selection with sacB was not utilized here.
The NA1000 ΔrsaA mutant was generated by mating pNPTS138Δ rsaA into NA1000, plating on PYE with kanamycin and nalidixic acid to select for the primary integrants. The transconjugants were plated on PYE sucrose and the sacB gene was used to select for the secondary recombination event and loss of the plasmid. The loss of rsaA was screen for by PCR and confirmed by sequencing.
Cells from the C. crescentus rsaA TEV250 strain, containing the genomic TEV-protease cleavage site, were grown in PYE medium ( Poindexter, 1964 46. Poindexter, J.S. Biological properties and classification of the Caulobacter group Bacteriol. Rev. 1964; 28 :231-295 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) for 24 hours at 20°C with shaking at 180 rpm. Six liters of the bacterial culture were centrifuged (5000 rcf, 4°C, 30 min). The pelleted cells were re-suspended in 50 mM HEPES/HCl buffer at pH 2.0 on ice for 10 min with vigorous shaking. Next, the suspension was centrifuged (16000 rcf, 4°C, 30 min). The pellet was discarded and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.0 with 5 M NaOH. The resulting liquid was filtered and loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare). All purification steps were performed using an ÄKTA pure 25 M system (GE Healthcare) operating at 4°C. The flow-through from the column was collected and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 for 3 hours at 4°C. The dialyzed solution was loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare), washed with 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and then eluted with the same buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl. Fractions containing pure RsaA TEV250 were collected and cleaved overnight by addition of His 6 -TEV protease in a ratio of 1:100 (wt:wt). His 6 -TEV protease was removed by loading the protein solution to a 5 mL HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). The flow-through was collected, concentrated and loaded to a Superdex S200 16/600 (prep grade) column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 100 mM, 1 mM CaCl 2 . RsaA NTD was eluted with the same buffer and fractions containing RsaA NTD were collected and concentrated upto 3.7 mg/mL protein concentration (Amicon 10 kDa MWCO). Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
Wild-type RsaA protein was purified as described previously ( Bharat et al., 2017 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications as follows: C. crescentus CB15N (NA1000) cells were grown in PYE medium for 24 hours at 25°C with shaking. The resulting culture (4 L) was centrifuged (5000 rcf, 4°C, 30 min) and the pelleted cells were re-suspended in 50 mM HEPES/HCl buffer at pH 2.0 on ice for 10 min with vigorous shaking. Next, the suspension was centrifuged (16000 rcf, 4°C, 30 min) and the cell pellet was discarded. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.0 with 5 M NaOH, filtered and loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare). The flow-through from the column was collected and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 overnight at 4°C. The dialyzed protein solution was loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare), washed with 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and then eluted with the same buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl. Fractions containing pure RsaA were collected and dialyzed against 20 mM Tricine/NaOH pH 8.0 and then concentrated to ∼25 mg/mL. Aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
Crude LPS was purified as described previously ( Jones et al., 2015 34. Jones, M.D. ∙ Vinogradov, E. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ... The core and O-polysaccharide structure of the Caulobacter crescentus lipopolysaccharide Carbohydr. Res. 2015; 402 :111-117 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a few modifications as follows. Crude LPS was purified from a C. crescentus Δ rsaA strain, cells were grown in PYE medium for 24 hours at 30°C with shaking at 180 rpm. Two liters of the bacterial culture were centrifuged (5000 rcf, 4°C, 30 min). The pelleted cells were washed once with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and recentrifuged (16000 rcf, 4°C, 30 min). Pelleted cells were resuspended in 60 mL of PBS supplemented with 35 mM EDTA to extract LPS from the cell surface under gentle agitation. Cells were removed by two consecutive centrifugation steps (16000 rcf, 4°C, 30 min) and resulting supernatant was treated with 50 μg/mL DNaseI and 1 U/mL benzonase (Sigma Aldrich) and dialysed against 5 mM MgCl 2 for 4 hours at 25°C. Proteinase K was added to the dialysed solution to a final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL and incubated at 50°C overnight. The proteinase K treated sample was clarified by two centrifugation steps (50000 rcf, 4°C, 1 hour and 200000 rcf, 4°C, 3 hours). Aliquots of the resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and stained with Pro-Q Emerald 300 Lipopolysaccharide Gel Stain Kit (ThermoFisher). While a minor fraction of the isolated LPS was lost in the pellet, the majority was found in the supernatant which was concentrated 120 times (Amicon 3.5 kDa MWCO) and loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 200 mM NaCl. Crude LPS was eluted with the same buffer and monitored at a wavelength of 215 nm. Fractions containing high absorbance were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Pro-Q Emerald 300 staining and Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. Aliquots containing crude LPS were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
PS was partially released from purified, crude LPS by hydrolysis with acetic acid (1% (v/v), 95°C, 2 hours). The sample was clarified by centrifugation (16000 rcf, 4°C, 30 min) and adjusted to pH 7.0 by addition of 1 M HEPES/NaOH pH 7.0. An excess of purified RsaA NTD was mixed with hydrolysed PS and the mixture was dialyzed against 25 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM CaCl 2 overnight at 4°C. The sample was loaded to a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer. Peak fractions containing oligomeric RsaA NTD were collected, concentrated (Amicon 30 kDa MWCO) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
For cellular cryo-ET ( Figure 4 ), CB15N C. crescentus cells or cells with genomic deletion of rsaA (Δ rsaA strain), were grown in PYE medium to late log phase at 30°C with vigorous shaking and directly used for grid preparations. For probing binding of RsaA to cellular LPS, Δ rsaA cells were mixed with purified RsaA NTD (∼1 mg/mL final concentration) or with RsaA (full-length) protein (∼2.5 mg/mL final concentration). Cells were incubated with vigorous shaking for 15 min at room temperature before vitrification. Ca 2+ dependence of RsaA NTD binding to the cell surfaces was tested by centrifuging 5 mL of late log phase Δ rsaA cells (16000 rcf, 25°C, 10 min) and resuspending the pellet in the 5 mL of liquid containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether)- N , N , N ′, N ′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). This process was repeated three times, and the sample was mixed with purified RsaA NTD (∼1 mg/mL final concentration) and incubated at room temperature with vigorous shaking for 15 min before vitrification.
For cryo-EM grid preparation 2.5 μL of purified RsaA NTD or RsaA NTD :PS complex (2.5 mg/mL) was applied to a freshly glow discharged Quantifoil R2/2 Cu/Rh 200 mesh grid, adsorbed for 10 s, blotted for 3 s and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane in a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher), while the blotting chamber was maintained at 100% humidity at 10°C. For cryo-ET sample preparation, purified or cellular samples were mixed with 10 nm protein-A gold (CMC Utrecht) before application to the cryo-EM grid.
Single-particle cryo-EM data was collected on a Titan Krios G3 microscope (ThermoFisher) operating at 300 kV fitted with a Quantum energy filter (slit width 20 eV) and a K2 direct electron detector (Gatan) with a sampling pixel size of 1.08 Å running in counting mode. In total 2422 movies were collected with a dose rate of 6.3 e - /pixel/s on the camera level. The sample was subjected to 8 s of exposure where a total dose of 43 e - /Å 2 was applied, and 20 frames were recorded per movie. Data collection for initial model generation using sub-tomogram was performed on the same Titan Krios microscope using the Quantum energy filter (slit width 30 eV) and the K2 direct electron detector running in counting mode with a dose rate of 5.5 e - /pixel/s (Gatan). Tilt series (6 in total) with a defocus range of −3 to −6 μm were collected between ± 60° in two directions from 0° at 2° tilt increment. A total dose of 100 e - /Å 2 was applied over the entire series, and image data was sampled at a calibrated pixel size of 2.238 Å. For cellular samples, tilt series (wt: 10 tilt series; Δ rsaA : 13 tilt series; Δ rsaA + RsaA NTD : 7 tilt series; Δ rsaA + RsaA: 2 tilt series) were collected at a dose rate of 11.3 e - /pixel/s, with a total dose over the series of 81 e - /Å 2 . Data was sampled at a calibrated pixel size of 5.571 Å using the K2 direct electron detector running in counting mode (slit width 20 eV). For high-resolution in situ structure determination of the S-layer, a pipeline for high-throughput data collection was adopted ( Wan et al., 2017 64. Wan, W. ∙ Kolesnikova, L. ∙ Clarke, M. ... Structure and assembly of the Ebola virus nucleocapsid Nature. 2017; 551 :394-397 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a Titan Krios microscope was used to collect tilt series data with a dose symmetric tilting scheme ( Hagen et al., 2017 27. Hagen, W.J.H. ∙ Wan, W. ∙ Briggs, J.A.G. Implementation of a cryo-electron tomography tilt-scheme optimized for high resolution subtomogram averaging J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :191-198 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tilt series were collected at a pixel size of 1.3 Å, with a total dose of 140 e - /Å 2 was applied over entire series collected between ± 60° with 3° tilt increments ( Bharat et al., 2017 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Initial model generation from cryo-ET data was performed using the Relion sub-tomogram averaging pipeline ( Bharat et al., 2015; Bharat and Scheres, 2016 7. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. Resolving macromolecular structures from electron cryo-tomography data using subtomogram averaging in RELION Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :2054-2065 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar 9. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Russo, C.J. ∙ Löwe, J. ... Advances in Single-Particle Electron Cryomicroscopy Structure Determination applied to Sub-tomogram Averaging Structure. 2015; 23 :1743-1753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). An unambiguous 3D reference was generated and used in the single-particle EM pipeline as follows. Movies were motion corrected and dose weighted with MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 65. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in Relion 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 66. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer functions (CTFs) of the resulting motion corrected micrographs were estimated using CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 49. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were extracted with a 300 pixel × 300 pixel box and classified using reference-free 2D-classification inside Relion 3.0. Particles from classes showing high-resolution features were subjected to 3D classification using the unbiased sub-tomogram averaging reference structure described above. Particles from two main 3D classes containing 21 or 20 RsaA NTD subunits were combined for a focused 3D auto refinement on the central 14 subunits using the output from the 3D classification as a starting model. The final map was obtained from 115,776 particles and post-processed using a soft mask focused on the inner fourteen subunits yielding a sharpened map with a B -factor of −85.8 Å 2 and a resolution of 3.68 Å according to the gold standard Fourier shell correlation criterion of 0.143 ( Scheres and Chen, 2012 52. Scheres, S.H.W. ∙ Chen, S. Prevention of overfitting in cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :853-854 Crossref Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Tilt series alignment using gold fiducials and tomogram generation was carried out using IMOD ( Kremer et al., 1996 36. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (4018) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sub-tomogram averaging processing was performed using custom scripts written in MATLAB, described in detail elsewhere ( Bharat et al., 2011; Wan et al., 2017 8. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Riches, J.D. ∙ Kolesnikova, L. ... Cryo-electron tomography of Marburg virus particles and their morphogenesis within infected cells PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1001196 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Wan, W. ∙ Kolesnikova, L. ∙ Clarke, M. ... Structure and assembly of the Ebola virus nucleocapsid Nature. 2017; 551 :394-397 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cellular sub-tomogram averages (see Figures 4 and S5 ) were lowpass filtered to the same resolution of 40 Å for comparison. For high-resolution cryo-ET structure determination, we adopted previously published methods ( Bharat et al., 2017 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the major difference being the use of a recently developed in 3D-CTF correction method for tomographic data ( Turoňová et al., 2017 62. Turoňová, B. ∙ Schur, F.K.M. ∙ Wan, W. ... Efficient 3D-CTF correction for cryo-electron tomography using NovaCTF improves subtomogram averaging resolution to 3.4Å J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 199 :187-195 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we used focused alignment on the RsaA NTD part of the S-layer to improve this region of the map to observe LPS binding. The final map was obtained from 51,866 hexameric units of the S-layer from 110 tomograms ( Bharat et al., 2017 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Post-processing using a softened mask focused on the inner domain and pore region of RsaA yielded a sharpened map with a B -factor of −224.953 Å 2 applied and a resolution of 4.82 Å ( Figure S6 ) according to the 0.143 criterion. The final map has not been explicitly symmetrized and local resolution differences were estimated in Relion 3.0. Figures were prepared using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 53. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ) and MATLAB.
The carbon backbone of the RsaA NTD protein was manually traced through a single subunit of the cryo-EM density using Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 21. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initially, side chains were assigned in regions with density corresponding to characteristic aromatic residues allowing us to deduce the register of the amino acid sequence in the map. Side chains for residues 2-243 of RsaA were thus assigned unambiguously and the structure was refined and manually rebuilt using Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 42. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (6737) PubMed Google Scholar ) inside the CCP-EM ( Burnley et al., 2017 12. Burnley, T. ∙ Palmer, C.M. ∙ Winn, M. Recent developments in the CCP-EM software suite Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2017; 73 :469-477 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ) software suite and Coot. Additional subunits around the spiral of the RsaA NTD :PS complex were generated by rigid body fitting the refined monomeric unit into the cryo-EM density. Areas of strong and continuous density connecting protein subunits along the long axis of the spiral could not be explained by any amino acid residues in RsaA NTD and were therefore assigned to the O-antigen of the C. crescentus LPS, to which RsaA NTD is known to bind ( Bharat et al., 2017; Ford et al., 2007 10. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Kureisaite-Ciziene, D. ∙ Hardy, G.G. ... Structure of the hexagonal surface layer on Caulobacter crescentus cells Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17059 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Ford, M.J. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ∙ Smit, J. S-layer anchoring and localization of an S-layer-associated protease in Caulobacter crescentus J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :2226-2237 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). The chemistry of the heptameric repeating unit of the O-antigen has been described previously ( Jones et al., 2015 34. Jones, M.D. ∙ Vinogradov, E. ∙ Nomellini, J.F. ... The core and O-polysaccharide structure of the Caulobacter crescentus lipopolysaccharide Carbohydr. Res. 2015; 402 :111-117 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), and was used to build the main chain of the PS. Orientation of the PS was assigned by iterative rebuilding and refinement using restraints for N-Acetyl-perosamine (PerNac) which were generated with PRODRG ( Schüttelkopf and van Aalten, 2004 55. Schüttelkopf, A.W. ∙ van Aalten, D.M.F. PRODRG: a tool for high-throughput crystallography of protein-ligand complexes Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :1355-1363 Crossref Scopus (4634) PubMed Google Scholar ) and existing restraints for mannose. Comprehensive model validation of the final structure and map was performed in PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see Table S1 ). The final refined cryo-EM structure of RsaA NTD and the X-ray structure of RsaA CTD (PDB ID 5N8P ) were rigid body docked into the 4.8 Å cryo-ET map and were not refined further. Figures containing protein structures or cryo-EM/ET data were prepared using USCF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Samples were loaded into a gold coated needle prepared in-house and introduced into a Q-Exactive UHMR mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher), as described previously ( Gault et al., 2016 25. Gault, J. ∙ Donlan, J.A.C. ∙ Liko, I. ... High-resolution mass spectrometry of small molecules bound to membrane proteins Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :333-336 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following parameters were used: capillary voltage was set to 1.2-1.4 kV, resolution was set to 17500 at m/z 200, injection flatopole was set to 5 V, inter flatopole lens was at 4 V, and bent flatopole at 2 V. Backing pressure was maintained at ∼3 × 10 −9 mbar. Stripped oligomers were obtained by MS/MS analysis at a voltage applied to the HCD cell of 220 V. Zeba™ micro spin desalting columns were used to remove the Ca 2+ ions. Data was analyzed using Xcalibur 4.2.
Atomistic simulations were run in triplicate for 100 ns using the CHARMM36m forcefield ( Huang et al., 2017 31. Huang, J. ∙ Rauscher, S. ∙ Nawrocki, G. ... CHARMM36m: an improved force field for folded and intrinsically disordered proteins Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :71-73 Crossref Scopus (3480) PubMed Google Scholar ). Simulations were performed at 310 K using the velocity-rescaling temperature coupling algorithm ( Bussi et al., 2007 13. Bussi, G. ∙ Donadio, D. ∙ Parrinello, M. Canonical sampling through velocity rescaling J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126 :014101 Crossref Scopus (11640) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a time constant of 0.1 ps and Parrinello-Rahman isotropic pressure coupling of 1 bar with a time constant of 2 ps ( Parrinello and Rahman, 1981 44. Parrinello, M. ∙ Rahman, A. Polymorphic transitions in single crystals: A new molecular-dynamics method J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 52 :7182-7190 Crossref Scopus (14082) Google Scholar ). Electrostatics were handled using the Particle-Mesh-Ewald method ( Darden et al., 1993 19. Darden, T. ∙ York, D. ∙ Pedersen, L. Particle mesh Ewald - an N.log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98 :10089-10092 Crossref Scopus (23943) Google Scholar ), and a force-switch modifier was applied to the Van der Waals forces. Dispersion corrections were turned off. The parameters for the O-antigen were generated using the CHARMM-GUI ( Kim et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2016 35. Kim, S. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Jo, S. ... CHARMM-GUI ligand reader and modeler for CHARMM force field generation of small molecules J. Comput. Chem. 2017; 38 :1879-1886 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar 37.

Theory Comput. 2016; 12 :405-413 Crossref Scopus (2290) PubMed Google Scholar ). All simulations were run using Gromacs 2019 ( Abraham et al., 2015 1. Abraham, M.J. ∙ Murtola, T. ∙ Schulz, R. ... GROMACS: High performance molecular simulations through multi-level parallelism from laptops to supercomputers SoftwareX. 2015; 1-2 :19-25 Crossref Scopus (14546) Google Scholar ). Molecular simulation images and Supplemental Movies of simulations were made in PyMOL ( Schrödinger, 2017 54. Schrödinger, L.L.C. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0. Schrödinger LLC, 2017 Google Scholar ). Graphs were plotted using Python and Matplotlib.
