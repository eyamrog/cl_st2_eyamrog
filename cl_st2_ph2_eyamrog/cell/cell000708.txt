Title: A microbial transporter of the dietary antioxidant ergothioneine


Abstract: Summary

Low-molecular-weight (LMW) thiols are small-molecule antioxidants required for the maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis. However, many host-associated microbes, including the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori , unexpectedly lack LMW-thiol biosynthetic pathways. Using reactivity-guided metabolomics, we identified the unusual LMW thiol ergothioneine (EGT) in H. pylori . Dietary EGT accumulates to millimolar levels in human tissues and has been broadly implicated in mitigating disease risk. Although certain microorganisms synthesize EGT, we discovered that H. pylori acquires this LMW thiol from the host environment using a highly selective ATP-binding cassette transporter—EgtUV. EgtUV confers a competitive colonization advantage in vivo and is widely conserved in gastrointestinal microbes. Furthermore, we found that human fecal bacteria metabolize EGT, which may contribute to production of the disease-associated metabolite trimethylamine N -oxide. Collectively, our findings illustrate a previously unappreciated mechanism of microbial redox regulation in the gut and suggest that inter-kingdom competition for dietary EGT may broadly impact human health.

Section: Introduction

The maintenance of redox homeostasis is essential for all cellular life. Although oxygen is necessary for aerobic metabolism, it is also the progenitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a family of electrophilic molecular oxidants generated by cellular respiration, immunological responses, and photo- or metallo-chemical reactions ( Cabiscol et al., 2000 15. Cabiscol, E. ∙ Tamarit, J. ∙ Ros, J. Oxidative stress in bacteria and protein damage by reactive oxygen species Int. Microbiol. 2000; 3 :3-8 PubMed Google Scholar ; Sies and Jones, 2020 91. Sies, H. ∙ Jones, D.P. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) as pleiotropic physiological signalling agents Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :363-383 Crossref Scopus (1141) PubMed Google Scholar ). When excess ROS accumulate within cells, biomolecules suffer oxidative damage that can impair critical cellular processes. Consequently, the rapid remediation of oxidative stress is paramount for cell survival.
Low-molecular-weight (LMW) thiols are the principal small molecules used by all life forms to maintain intracellular redox balance ( Ulrich and Jakob, 2019 101. Ulrich, K. ∙ Jakob, U. The role of thiols in antioxidant systems Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2019; 140 :14-27 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). LMW thiols can directly neutralize ROS and xenobiotics, regulate protein structure and function, and serve as cofactors for antioxidant and metabolic enzymes ( Ulrich and Jakob, 2019 101.

These sulfur-containing antioxidants are ubiquitous in nature. Glutathione (GSH) is the predominant LMW thiol synthesized by eukaryotes and many Gram-negative bacteria ( Forman et al., 2009 30. Forman, H.J. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Rinna, A. Glutathione: overview of its protective roles, measurement, and biosynthesis Mol. Aspects Med. 2009; 30 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ), but microorganisms lacking GSH typically produce functionally analogous compounds ( Fairlamb et al., 1985 28.

Defects in human GSH biosynthesis and metabolism have been implicated in debilitating metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases ( Ballatori et al., 2009 8.

Chem. 2009; 390 :191-214 Crossref Scopus (759) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the deletion of microbial LMW-thiol biosynthetic genes can attenuate bacterial survival within host environments ( Krieger et al., 2000 55.

Although all life forms are believed to require LMW-thiol antioxidants, several classes of bacteria lack the enzymes required to synthesize them de novo . Many of these microbes, like the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori , are also known to colonize animal hosts. H. pylori has co-evolved with humans for over 60,000 years and infects over half of the global population ( Linz et al., 2007 58. Linz, B. ∙ Balloux, F. ∙ Moodley, Y. ... An African origin for the intimate association between humans and Helicobacter pylori Nature. 2007; 445 :915-918 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ; Salama et al., 2013 84.

Microbiol. 2013; 11 :385-399 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). H. pylori colonization provokes chronic inflammation and the sustained release of ROS from gastric tissues, which can contribute to the formation of peptic ulcers or cancer in a subset of infected hosts ( Amieva and Peek, 2016 2. Amieva, M. ∙ Peek, Jr., R.M. Pathobiology of Helicobacter pylori -induced gastric cancer Gastroenterology. 2016; 150 :64-78 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ; Butcher et al., 2017 14.

Life in the human stomach: persistence strategies of the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11 :385-399 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). How H. pylori maintains intracellular redox homeostasis without producing known LMW thiols, despite persistent exposure to ROS in the host, remains unresolved.
In this study, we performed a targeted metabolomic analysis to investigate potential LMW thiols in H. pylori and identified the unusual antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT). EGT is a thiourea derivative of histidine synthesized by few bacteria and fungi and exclusively acquired by animals and plants from exogenous sources ( Cumming et al., 2018 21. Cumming, B.M. ∙ Chinta, K.C. ∙ Reddy, V.P. ... Role of ergothioneine in microbial physiology and pathogenesis Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2018; 28 :431-444 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). As an abundant component of the human diet, EGT is present at high levels in gastrointestinal tissues ( Tang et al., 2018 93. Tang, R.M.Y. ∙ Cheah, I.K.-M. ∙ Yew, T.S.K. ... Distribution and accumulation of dietary ergothioneine and its metabolites in mouse tissues Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :1601 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that H. pylori is unable to synthesize EGT and instead imports this compound from the host environment using a previously uncharacterized ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. This transporter is widely conserved in gastrointestinal microbes, revealing a common pathway for EGT acquisition and maintenance of microbial redox homeostasis in the host.

Section: Results

We employed a reactivity-guided metabolomics screen to identify LMW thiols in H. pylori , wherein bacterial cell extracts were treated with the thiol-alkylating agent monobromobimane (mBBr) ( Newton and Fahey, 1995 67. Newton, G.L. ∙ Fahey, R.C. Determination of biothiols by bromobimane labeling and high-performance liquid chromatography Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251 :148-166 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to enable detection of mBBr-labeled metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) ( Figure 1 A). Consistent with the lack of known LMW-thiol biosynthetic genes in H. pylori , we did not detect the bimane derivatives of GSH or its functional analogs bacillithiol or mycothiol in mBBr-treated H. pylori extracts. However, we observed a species with a mass-to-charge ratio ( m/z ) of 420.1700 (calc. MF C 19 H 26 N 5 O 4 S + ), which is equivalent to the calculated m/z for the bimane adduct of the LMW thiol EGT ( Figures 1 B and 1C). This species was only present in mBBr-treated extracts ( Figure 1 B) and exhibited the same chromatographic properties ( Figure 1 D) and fragmentation pattern ( Figure 1 E) as an mBBr-treated EGT standard when analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Together, these data support that H. pylori contains the LMW thiol EGT.
EGT is a sulfur-containing derivative of histidine that can scavenge potent oxidizing agents and inhibit the formation of oxygen radicals ( Cheah and Halliwell, 2012 17. Cheah, I.K. ∙ Halliwell, B. Ergothioneine; antioxidant potential, physiological function and role in disease Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1822 :784-793 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). EGT exists predominantly as a thione tautomer and thus possesses a higher standard reduction potential ( E o ′ = −0.06 V) than other LMW thiols like GSH ( E o ′ = −0.25 V) ( Hand and Honek, 2005 40. Hand, C.E. ∙ Honek, J.F. Biological chemistry of naturally occurring thiols of microbial and marine origin J. Nat. Prod. 2005; 68 :293-308 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, EGT is highly stable under physiological conditions but can reduce strong oxidants such as hypochlorous acid (bleach) and peroxynitrite. Although diet-derived EGT accumulates to millimolar concentrations in animal tissues, it is only synthesized by select fungal and bacterial species ( Halliwell et al., 2018 39. Halliwell, B. ∙ Cheah, I.K. ∙ Tang, R.M.Y. Ergothioneine – a diet-derived antioxidant with therapeutic potential FEBS Lett. 2018; 592 :3357-3366 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). The enzymes required for EGT biosynthesis include an S -adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, an iron(II)-dependent sulfoxide synthase, and a pyridoxal 5-phosphate-dependent β-lyase ( Figure S1 A; Bello et al., 2012 12. Bello, M.H. ∙ Barrera-Perez, V. ∙ Morin, D. ... The Neurospora crassa mutant Nc Δ Egt-1 identifies an ergothioneine biosynthetic gene and demonstrates that ergothioneine enhances conidial survival and protects against peroxide toxicity during conidial germination Fungal Genet. Biol. 2012; 49 :160-172 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Seebeck, 2010 90. Seebeck, F.P. In vitro reconstitution of mycobacterial ergothioneine biosynthesis J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 :6632-6633 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we were unable to identify orthologs of these enzymes in H. pylori using bioinformatic approaches. We therefore performed culture-based assays to determine whether H. pylori can synthesize EGT de novo .
To probe for biosynthesis, we supplemented broth cultures of H. pylori with EGT biosynthetic precursors ( Figure 1 F) and measured the EGT content of mBBr-treated cell extracts by LC-MS. Addition of 1 mM histidine or methionine or 0.2 mM cysteine to H. pylori cultures had no effect on EGT levels ( Figure 1 G). We also employed isotope tracing and LC-MS to determine whether H. pylori can synthesize isotopically labeled EGT when grown in the presence of the EGT precursor methionine-( methyl- 13 C). Although we observed the expected mass shift of +1 amu for SAM, we did not detect a similar mass shift for EGT ( Figures S1 B–S1D). Collectively, these data suggest canonical pathways for the production of EGT are not active in H. pylori .
Given that H. pylori culture medium is enriched with animal extracts that contain high levels of EGT ( Tang et al., 2018 93. Tang, R.M.Y. ∙ Cheah, I.K.-M. ∙ Yew, T.S.K. ... Distribution and accumulation of dietary ergothioneine and its metabolites in mouse tissues Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :1601 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that H. pylori may instead acquire EGT from the extracellular environment. To test this, we compared the EGT content of conditioned culture medium with that of medium alone. We observed a significant decrease in the EGT content of H. pylori culture supernatants relative to that of media controls ( Figure 1 H), suggesting that H. pylori can deplete EGT from the culture medium. To determine if exogenous EGT can accumulate in H. pylori cells, we grew H. pylori in medium supplemented with isotopically labeled “heavy” EGT (EGT-d 3 ). We observed a dose-dependent increase in the EGT-d 3 content of H. pylori cell extracts and a corresponding decrease in the levels of “light” EGT ( Figure 1 I). Altogether, these data demonstrate that H. pylori can import extracellular EGT.
We hypothesized that H. pylori encodes a transporter capable of translocating EGT across lipid membranes. Indeed, certain microorganisms incapable of GSH synthesis encode a transporter for its uptake ( Bachhawat et al., 2013 7. Bachhawat, A.K. ∙ Thakur, A. ∙ Kaur, J. ... Glutathione transporters Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1830 :3154-3164 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although mammalian cells import EGT via the sodium symporter OCTN1 (aka SLC22A4) ( Gründemann et al., 2005 37. Gründemann, D. ∙ Harlfinger, S. ∙ Golz, S. ... Discovery of the ergothioneine transporter Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :5256-5261 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar ), no OCTN1 orthologs are encoded by the H. pylori genome. Notably, the chemical structure of EGT resembles that of the bacterial osmolyte glycine betaine ( Figure 2 A). We therefore reasoned that H. pylori genes annotated as hypothetical betaine transporters could be responsible for EGT import. Through bioinformatic analyses, we identified two uncharacterized H. pylori genes encoding putative betaine transporters, HPG27_777 and HPG27_885 , and analyzed the EGT content of H. pylori strains disrupted at either locus ( HPG27_777::Tn and Δ HPG27_885 ) ( Yang et al., 2019 115. Yang, D.C. ∙ Blair, K.M. ∙ Taylor, J.A. ... A genome-wide Helicobacter pylori morphology screen uncovers a membrane-spanning helical cell shape domplex J. Bacteriol. 2019; 201 e00724–e00718 Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar ). Strikingly, HPG27_777::Tn cell extracts were devoid of EGT, whereas the EGT content of Δ HPG27_885 extracts was comparable with that of wild-type (WT) cells ( Figure 2 B). Furthermore, genetic disruption of HPG27_777 , but not HPG27_885 , restored the EGT content of culture supernatants to that of media alone ( Figure 2 C). Together, these data suggest that HPG27_777 is required for EGT uptake by H. pylori .
HPG27_777 resides in a putative two-gene operon with distinct features of a bacterial ABC transporter. HPG27_777 is predicted to encode a MetI-like transmembrane permease fused to a C-terminal periplasmic solute-binding domain (SBD) ( Figure 2 D). HPG27_778 , which lies downstream of HPG27_777 , encodes conserved motifs characteristic of the ATPase subunits of ABC transporters ( Figures 2 D, S2 A, and S2B; Davidson et al., 2008 22. Davidson, A.L. ∙ Dassa, E. ∙ Orelle, C. ... Structure, function, and evolution of bacterial ATP-binding cassette systems Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72 :317-364 Crossref Scopus (946) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilkens, 2015 110. Wilkens, S. Structure and mechanism of ABC transporters F1000Prime Rep. 2015; 7 :14 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that ABC transporters are multimeric complexes composed of transmembrane, solute-binding, and nucleotide-binding domains, we hypothesized that HPG27_777 and HPG27_778 together encode a functional EGT transporter. We generated deletion mutants of HPG27_777 and/or HPG27_778 in two different strains of H. pylori , G27MA and PMSS1, and confirmed that disruption of either gene inhibits EGT uptake ( Figures 2 E and S2 C). Genetic complementation of HPG27_777 and HPG27_778 at the native locus, or of HPG27_778 at a distal chromosomal site, restored the levels of cell- and media-associated EGT to those of WT H. pylori cultures ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S2 C–S2E). These findings confirm that both HPG27_777 and HPG27_778 (henceforth egtU and egtV , respectively) are required for EGT import by H. pylori .
Notably, the amount of EGT internalized by H. pylori (e.g., Figure 2 B versus 2E) and depleted from the culture medium (e.g., Figure 2 C versus 2F) varied across experiments despite identical assay conditions. We determined that the EGT content of freshly prepared culture medium decreases significantly over time ( Figure S2 F). Because H. pylori grows poorly in the absence of blood or serum, standardization of EGT levels using a chemically defined medium is not feasible. Consequently, we used fresh medium to maximize EGT uptake by H. pylori . Under such conditions (e.g., Figure 1 I), we estimate the intracellular EGT concentration approaches ∼1–2 mM (see STAR Methods ), which is consistent with the typical cytosolic concentrations of other microbial LMW thiols ( Fahey, 2013 27. Fahey, R.C. Glutathione analogs in prokaryotes Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1830 :3182-3198 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ritz and Beckwith, 2001 81. Ritz, D. ∙ Beckwith, J. Roles of thiol-redox pathways in bacteria Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55 :21-48 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Van Laer et al., 2013 102. Van Laer, K. ∙ Hamilton, C.J. ∙ Messens, J. Low-molecular-weight thiols in thiol-disulfide exchange Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18 :1642-1653 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To validate our genetic analyses, we expressed the EgtU SBD in Escherichia coli ( Figure S3 A) and evaluated binding of the purified protein to EGT by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The EgtU SBD bound to EGT with low-micromolar affinity ( K d = 2 μM) ( Figure 2 G; Table S1 ); by contrast, we did not detect binding to the structurally similar compounds glycine betaine, choline, proline, carnitine, or histidine ( Figures 2 G and S3 B–S3E), suggesting that EGT is the physiological ligand of EgtU. Altogether, our data support that EgtU and EgtV form an ABC importer of EGT.
Given EGT is abundant in gastrointestinal tissues ( Tang et al., 2018 93. Tang, R.M.Y. ∙ Cheah, I.K.-M. ∙ Yew, T.S.K. ... Distribution and accumulation of dietary ergothioneine and its metabolites in mouse tissues Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :1601 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that H. pylori may import EGT derived from gastric cells during infection. To test this, we grew human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) epithelial cells overnight in the presence of 1 μg/mL EGT-d 3 , washed the cells to remove exogeneous EGT-d 3 , and then co-cultured the AGS cells with WT, Δ egtV , or Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori G27MA (multiplicity of infection 50). After 10 h, we harvested nonadherent bacteria from the cell culture media and measured the EGT-d 3 content of the bacterial cells, AGS cells, and clarified cell culture media ( Figure 3 A; see STAR Methods ). EGT-d 3 was only detected in AGS cells pretreated with EGT-d 3 , demonstrating that AGS cells can import exogenous EGT ( Figure 3 B, bars 1 and 2). H. pylori infection did not significantly alter the EGT-d 3 content of AGS extracts ( Figure 3 B, bars 3–5); however, conditioned media from AGS cell cultures infected with WT or Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori contained ∼3-fold less EGT-d 3 than media from mock-infected cultures ( Figure 3 C, bars 3 and 5). By contrast, the media concentration of EGT-d 3 in AGS cell cultures containing the Δ egtV mutant was comparable to that of AGS cells cultured in media alone ( Figure 3 C, bars 2 and 4). Notably, media levels of EGT-d 3 increased significantly over the 10 h incubation period even in the absence of H. pylori ( Figure 3 D), suggesting that AGS cells can release intracellular EGT-d 3 into the cell culture medium. We observed corresponding trends in the bacteria harvested from these cultures: EGT-d 3 was detected in WT and Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori , but not in the Δ egtV mutant ( Figure 3 E), although all strains were equally viable under these conditions ( Figure 3 F). These data demonstrate that H. pylori can import EGT derived from gastric cells and that the EgtUV transporter is required for this activity.
H. pylori colonizes the gastric glands of the host, where it induces neutrophil recruitment and stimulates respiratory bursts that release ROS such as bleach and hydrogen peroxide into the infection microenvironment ( Butcher et al., 2017 14.

Salama, N.R. ∙ Hartung, M.L. ∙ Müller, A. Life in the human stomach: persistence strategies of the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11 :385-399 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bleach is the primary oxidant produced by activated neutrophils and can achieve millimolar levels in inflamed tissues ( Ulfig and Leichert, 2021 100. Ulfig, A. ∙ Leichert, L.I. The effects of neutrophil-generated hypochlorous acid and other hypohalous acids on host and pathogens Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2021; 78 :385-414 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weiss, 1989 109. Weiss, S.J. Tissue destruction by neutrophils N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320 :365-376 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if EGT import enhances H. pylori resistance to such ROS, we cultured WT, Δ egtV , and Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori in standard growth medium, which naturally contains EGT ( Figure S2 F), and compared the colony-forming units (CFUs) of each strain following exposure to 5 mM bleach or hydrogen peroxide. Bleach treatment reduced the CFU of all three strains relative to vehicle-treated controls after 15 min; however, the Δ egtV mutant produced ∼10-fold fewer CFU than the WT and Δ egtV::egtV strains ( Figure 4 A). Lower concentrations of bleach had a subtler effect on Δ egtV viability, whereas 10 mM bleach completely inhibited H. pylori growth ( Figures S4 A and S4B). By contrast, hydrogen peroxide treatment did not inhibit growth of any of the strains ( Figure 4 B), suggesting that other mechanisms of the H. pylori antioxidant response (e.g., catalase production) may be sufficient to detoxify hydrogen peroxide under the tested conditions. These findings suggest that EGT uptake may selectively increase H. pylori resistance to the neutrophil oxidant bleach.
Bleach was recently shown to be a chemoattractant for H. pylori ( Perkins et al., 2019 72. Perkins, A. ∙ Tudorica, D.A. ∙ Amieva, M.R. ... Helicobacter pylori senses bleach (HOCl) as a chemoattractant using a cytosolic chemoreceptor PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000395 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because chemotaxis facilitates H. pylori colonization of the gastric glands ( Howitt et al., 2011 43. Howitt, M.R. ∙ Lee, J.Y. ∙ Lertsethtakarn, P. ... ChePep controls Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric glands and chemotaxis in the Epsilonproteobacteria mBio. 2011; 2 e00098–e00011 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Keilberg et al., 2016 53. Keilberg, D. ∙ Zavros, Y. ∙ Shepherd, B. ... Spatial and temporal shifts in bacterial biogeography and gland occupation during the development of a chronic infection mBio. 2016; 7 :e01705-16 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), and EgtUV enhances H. pylori resistance to bleach, we next assessed whether EGT import influences H. pylori colonization in vivo . Notably, EGT is present in mouse chow, gastric tissue, and digested food ( Figure S4 C), suggesting H. pylori has ample access to EGT in the gastric environment. We orally infected female C57BL/6J mice with WT, Δ egtV , or Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori or with a 1:1 mixture of the mutant and WT or complemented strains. We then quantified the H. pylori CFU in murine gastric tissues at either 1, 8, and 16 weeks post-infection (single infections) to evaluate colonization dynamics over time or at 2 weeks post-infection (co-infections) to evaluate competition for the gastric niche at an early time point when H. pylori is known to establish gland occupancy ( Figure 4 C; Keilberg et al., 2016 53. Keilberg, D. ∙ Zavros, Y. ∙ Shepherd, B. ... Spatial and temporal shifts in bacterial biogeography and gland occupation during the development of a chronic infection mBio. 2016; 7 :e01705-16 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). In singly colonized mice, deletion of egtV had no effect on H. pylori gastric colonization at any time point ( Figure 4 D). In addition, mice infected with WT, Δ egtV , or Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori for 16 weeks displayed similar gastric tissue histopathology ( Figures S4 D–S4H). By contrast, when we co-infected mice with a 1:1 mixture of WT and Δ egtV H. pylori , the WT strain exhibited a significant colonization advantage: after 2 weeks, WT H. pylori outcompeted the Δ egtV mutant by ∼20-fold ( Figures 4 E and S4 I). A similar trend was observed in mice co-infected with Δ egtV::egtV and Δ egtV H. pylori ( Figures 4 E and S4 J), demonstrating the functional importance of EgtV in vivo . Notably, WT, Δ egtV , and Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori had uniform growth kinetics when cultured individually in vitro ( Figure S5 A), but when co-cultured in a 1:1 ratio, the WT and complemented strains outcompeted the mutant strain by roughly 10-fold after 21 h ( Figures S5 B–S5D). Altogether, these results demonstrate that EgtUV confers a competitive colonization advantage to H. pylori in the gastric environment. Because gastric cells also actively import EGT, our data imply that competition for this metabolite at the host-microbe interface may influence microbial homeostasis in vivo ( Figure 4 F).
We next conducted a bioinformatic analysis to survey the extent of EgtUV conservation in other microbial species. Because the substrate specificities of ABC transporters are dictated by their respective SBDs, we performed BLASTp searches for EgtUV homologs using the EgtU SBD as the query sequence in order to reduce the identification of proteins with sequence similarity to more widely conserved elements of ABC transporters. Our analysis uncovered EgtUV homologs encoded by numerous bacterial phyla, including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria ( Table S2 ). Putative EGT transporters were identified in many clinically important pathogens and members of the human gut microbiota (e.g., Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Clostridiodes difficile , and Eggerthella lenta ), including the major archaeal species of the gut, Methanobrevibacter smithii ( Figure 5 A; Table S2 ). All identified EgtUV homologs belong to the OpuAC family of ABC transporters (Pfam), a protein family often transcriptionally and/or post-translationally regulated by oxidative, osmotic, or starvation stress ( Checroun and Gutierrez, 2004 18. Checroun, C. ∙ Gutierrez, C. Sigma(s)-dependent regulation of yehZYXW , which encodes a putative osmoprotectant ABC transporter of Escherichia coli FEMS Microbiol.

However, the physiological functions and ligands of many of these homologs are unknown ( Lang et al., 2015 57. Lang, S. ∙ Cressatti, M. ∙ Mendoza, K.E. ...

Microbiol. 2022; 24 :1499-1517 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We constructed a protein phylogenetic tree using the sequences of 35 EgtU-like SBDs from microbial species spanning diverse phyla ( Figure 5 A). The putative transporters clustered into four distinct clades differentiated by the genomic architectures of the transporter loci, which consisted of either 2- or 4-gene operons. Notably, the phylogenetic distribution of EgtU SBD homologs contradicts classic taxonomic relationships, suggesting egtUV may have been horizontally acquired.
To test whether EgtUV homology is predictive of EGT transport, we cultured bacteria that either encode or lack transporter homologs in media supplemented with EGT-d 3 and measured EGT-d 3 uptake by LC-MS. We detected EGT-d 3 in the cell extracts of all species containing egtUV orthologs ( C. difficile , S. enterica Typhimurium, E. coli , and Listeria monocytogenes ); however, bacteria lacking any portion of the transporter locus were devoid of EGT-d 3 ( Figure 5 B). Disruption of the putative SBD-encoding genes of E. coli and S. enterica (aka yehZ ) prevented bacterial uptake of EGT-d 3 , and internalization was restored by complementation of the mutant strains ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Similarly, deletion of the egtU homolog in C. difficile ( CD630_32160 ) nearly eliminated EGT transport activity ( Figure 5 E). Notably, a second EgtUV-like transporter encoded by S. enterica —OsmYXWV ( Frossard et al., 2012 31. Frossard, S.M. ∙ Khan, A.A. ∙ Warrick, E.C. ... Identification of a third osmoprotectant transport system, the OsmU system, in Salmonella enterica J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194 :3861-3871 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar )—is dispensable for EGT import ( Figure 5 D), whereas the C. difficile EgtUV paralog OpuCC may contribute to EGT uptake in the absence of CD630_32160 ( Figure 5 E). Altogether, these data demonstrate EGT import is a widespread microbial process mediated by the conserved ABC-type transporter EgtUV.
To define the mechanism of EgtU binding to EGT, we determined a 1.3 Å crystal structure of the H. pylori EgtU SBD and a 3.4 Å structure of the EgtU-EGT complex ( Figures 6 A and 6B; Table S3 ). Similar to other type II solute-binding proteins in ABC transporters, the EgtU SBD adopts a bi-lobed architecture with two α/β lobes connected by a central hinge ( Schiefner et al., 2004a 86. Schiefner, A. ∙ Breed, J. ∙ Bösser, L. ... Cation-pi interactions as determinants for binding of the compatible solutes glycine betaine and proline betaine by the periplasmic ligand-binding protein ProX from Escherichia coli J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :5588-5596 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the ligand-bound form, the EgtU SBD lobes collapse at the central hinge region and rotate ∼40° to close around EGT ( Figure 6 C). EGT is bound deep within the cleft between the α/β lobes ( Figures 6 B and S6 A), with a conserved “betaine box” formed by residues Y346, Y390, F469, and Y493 at the back of the pocket that cages the EGT trimethylammonium group ( Figure 6 D). Betaine box motifs are conserved in other solute-binding proteins of ABC transporters that recognize ligands structurally similar to EGT including glycine betaine ( Figures S6 B and S6C; Schiefner et al., 2004a 86. Schiefner, A. ∙ Breed, J. ∙ Bösser, L. ... Cation-pi interactions as determinants for binding of the compatible solutes glycine betaine and proline betaine by the periplasmic ligand-binding protein ProX from Escherichia coli J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :5588-5596 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar , 2004b 87. Schiefner, A. ∙ Holtmann, G. ∙ Diederichs, K. ...

Chem. 2004; 279 :48270-48281 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with a role for aromatic side chains in forming a hydrophobic cage, an EgtU Y390A mutation disrupted EGT binding, whereas a conservative Y390F mutation did not impede ligand recognition ( Figures 6 E, S6 D, and S6E; Table S1 ). Several residues coordinate the thioimidazole moiety of EGT at the front of the pocket, including R454. Notably, a positively charged residue is conserved at this site in EGT transporter proteins YehZ of E. coli and S. enterica and CD630_32160 of C. difficile , but not in E. coli ProX or S. enterica OsmX ( Figures 6 F and S7 ). A charge-swap mutation of this residue, R454E, resulted in the complete loss of EGT binding, whereas an R454A mutation retained EGT binding, albeit with ∼4-fold lower affinity than WT ( Figures 6 G, S6 D, and S6E; Table S1 ). Together, these data confirm that EgtU functions as an EGT-specific solute-binding protein and provide a molecular basis for ligand recognition.
Given the widespread distribution of EgtUV in gastrointestinal microbes, we next considered whether EGT can be metabolized by human gut commensals. Dietary compounds containing quaternary ammonium groups, such as choline, glycine betaine, and carnitine, can be metabolized to trimethylamine (TMA) by gut bacteria ( Rath et al., 2019 79. Rath, S. ∙ Rud, T. ∙ Pieper, D.H. ... Potential TMA-producing bacteria are ubiquitously found in Mammalia Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10 :2966 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). TMA is then further oxidized by monooxygenases in the liver to produce TMA N -oxide (TMAO), a metabolite broadly associated with cardiovascular disease ( Fennema et al., 2016 29. Fennema, D. ∙ Phillips, I.R. ∙ Shephard, E.A. Trimethylamine and trimethylamine N -oxide, a Flavin-containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-mediated host-microbiome metabolic axis implicated in health and disease Drug Metab.

Trimethylamine N -oxide: the good, the bad and the unknown Toxins. 2016; 8 :326 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, EGT can be degraded to TMA and thiourocanic acid by the enzyme ergothionase ( Figure 7 A; Beliaeva et al., 2021 11. Beliaeva, M.A. ∙ Leisinger, F. ∙ Seebeck, F.P.

Biotechnol. 2013; 97 :5389-5400 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is encoded by several microbial species, but not H. pylori . However, it is unknown whether EGT can be metabolized by gut commensal bacteria or whether microbial metabolism of EGT can contribute to TMA production in the host. To address these questions, we incubated human fecal (HF) samples from 25 healthy individuals, which contained similar levels of viable and taxonomically diverse bacteria ( Zimmermann et al., 2019 117. Zimmermann, M. ∙ Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, M. ∙ Wegmann, R. ... Mapping human microbiome drug metabolism by gut bacteria and their genes Nature. 2019; 570 :462-467 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ), with 25 μg EGT-d 9 under anerobic conditions, and quantified the degradation of EGT-d 9 ( Figure 7 B) and its conversion to TMA-d 9 ( Figure 7 C) by LC-MS. Of the 25 tested samples, 17 degraded EGT-d 9 by over 90%, whereas the remaining 8 samples exhibited variable activity, degrading EGT-d 9 by 7%–50% ( Figure 7 B). One sample with high EGT-degrading activity (H7) also produced TMA-d 9 ( Figure 7 C). These results suggest EGT is catabolized by gut bacteria and that in a subset of individuals, EGT can be converted to TMA in the host. As such, EGT may not only enhance the antioxidant response of EGT-importing bacteria but also fuel the production of bioactive metabolites like TMAO that impact host physiology.

Section: Discussion

We identified a highly selective microbial transporter of the LMW thiol EGT. EGT import fortifies H. pylori resistance to oxidative stress and allows the pathogen to compete successfully for colonization of the gastric mucosa. Widespread distribution of the EgtUV transporter in gastrointestinal microbes reveals a previously unappreciated role for dietary EGT in regulating microbial redox biology within the host. Furthermore, cross-kingdom competition for EGT, coupled with the emerging immunomodulatory and neuroprotective activities of this metabolite in vivo (see below), suggest that microbial import and metabolism of EGT may broadly influence host physiology.
Resistance to oxidative stress is a critical aspect of H. pylori adaptation to the host environment that underlies gastric pathology. Chronic H. pylori infection induces sustained inflammatory processes that can injure host tissues and potentiate cancer development. Although various antioxidant enzymes are necessary for H. pylori survival under oxidizing conditions ( Wang et al., 2006 107. Wang, G. ∙ Alamuri, P. ∙ Maier, R.J. The diverse antioxidant systems of Helicobacter pylori Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61 :847-860 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ), EGT is the only LMW thiol shown to reinforce the pathogen’s antioxidant response. We found EGT import is required for H. pylori resistance to bleach ( Figure 4 A). Recent work by Guillemin and coworkers demonstrated that H. pylori is attracted to bleach ( Perkins et al., 2019 72. Perkins, A. ∙ Tudorica, D.A. ∙ Amieva, M.R. ... Helicobacter pylori senses bleach (HOCl) as a chemoattractant using a cytosolic chemoreceptor PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000395 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may facilitate persistent colonization of inflamed tissues. Indeed, H. pylori mutants lacking the bleach-responsive chemoreceptor TlpD exhibit reduced gland occupancy ( Collins et al., 2018 20. Collins, K.D. ∙ Hu, S. ∙ Grasberger, H. ... Chemotaxis allows bacteria to overcome host-generated reactive oxygen species that constrain gland colonization Infect. Immun. 2018; 86 :e00878-17 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Huang et al., 2017 44. Huang, J.Y. ∙ Goers Sweeney, E. ∙ Guillemin, K. ... Multiple acid sensors control Helicobacter pylori colonization of the stomach PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006118 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several chemotaxis-deficient strains with gland colonization defects are dramatically outcompeted by WT H. pylori in co-infected mice despite colonizing gastric tissues to similar levels as WT H. pylori in singly infected mice ( Andermann et al., 2002 4. Andermann, T.M. ∙ Chen, Y.T. ∙ Ottemann, K.M. Two predicted chemoreceptors of Helicobacter pylori promote stomach infection Infect. Immun. 2002; 70 :5877-5881 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Howitt et al., 2011 43. Howitt, M.R. ∙ Lee, J.Y. ∙ Lertsethtakarn, P. ... ChePep controls Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric glands and chemotaxis in the Epsilonproteobacteria mBio. 2011; 2 e00098–e00011 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, the increased bleach tolerance conferred by H. pylori import of EGT likely facilitates bacterial colonization of the glandular niche and may account for the competitive colonization advantage of EgtUV-expressing strains in vivo ( Figure 4 E).
The ability of H. pylori to import EGT likely reflects its long co-evolutionary history with humans. Because H. pylori is routinely exposed to dietary products in the gastric environment, it has a limited biosynthetic capacity and encodes multiple transport systems to internalize host metabolites ( Burns and Mendz, 2001 13. Burns, B.P. ∙ Mendz, G.L. Metabolite transport Mobley, H.L.T. ∙ Mendz, G.L. ∙ Hazell, S.L. (Editors) Helicobacter pylori : physiology and genetics ASM Press, 2001 Crossref Google Scholar ). Precisely how H. pylori forages EGT from the host remains unclear. EGT may be directly acquired from digested food in the stomach lumen; alternatively, H. pylori may appropriate EGT from gastric cells or erythrocytes. Cellular damage induced by secreted H. pylori proteins or local inflammation could stimulate the leakage of intracellular EGT. Alternatively, host tissues may secrete EGT via an efflux pump prior to H. pylori uptake. Further studies are needed to evaluate H. pylori import of EGT from normal gastric cells, to establish the primary EGT reservoir for H. pylori in vivo , and to determine whether other bacterial or host proteins are necessary for microbial acquisition of dietary EGT in the gastrointestinal tract.
The EgtUV transporter is conserved in microbes from diverse phyla with wide-ranging physiological properties ( Figure 5 A). We speculate that the transporter locus was horizontally acquired due to the phylogenetic incongruence between the transporter genes and the microorganisms encoding them. For example, the H. pylori EgtU SBD shares greater amino-acid sequence similarity with homologs encoded by Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria than with homologs encoded by other Proteobacteria. Since EGT is a common component of the mammalian diet, egtUV may have been laterally acquired to support microbial adaptation to the host environment. Along these lines, the transporter is predominantly associated with host-adapted species of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract ( Figure 5 A; Table S2 ). Several of the transporter complexes we identified have been extensively characterized using biochemical and biophysical approaches ( Du et al., 2011 25. Du, Y. ∙ Shi, W.W. ∙ He, Y.X. ... Structures of the substrate-binding protein provide insights into the multiple compatible solute binding specificities of the Bacillus subtilis ABC transporter OpuC Biochem.

Pittelkow, M. ∙ Tschapek, B. ∙ Smits, S.H. ... The crystal structure of the substrate-binding protein OpuBC from Bacillus subtilis in complex with choline J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411 :53-67 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, in many cases, the physiological ligand(s) of the SBDs have remained elusive. The E. coli YehZYXW system, for example, has been classified as a low-affinity betaine transporter with binding affinities for betaine compounds in the low-millimolar range ( Lang et al., 2015 57. Lang, S. ∙ Cressatti, M. ∙ Mendoza, K.E. ... YehZYXW of Escherichia coli is a low-affinity, non-osmoregulatory betaine-specific ABC transporter Biochemistry. 2015; 54 :5735-5747 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given YehZ is required for EGT import by E. coli and that its H. pylori counterpart binds to EGT with a K d of 2 μM, we postulate that EGT is the primary substrate of YehZ and related homologs.
The assembly of bacterial ABC importers is typically orchestrated by four genes that together encode an ATPase, a permease, and a periplasmic SBD. By contrast, H. pylori egtUV and several of its homologs consist of just two genes, which encode an ATPase and a permease-SBD fusion protein. The H. pylori transporter is therefore most likely composed of a dimeric complex of EgtU and EgtV. Some of the transporter homologs we identified also contain accessory functional domains: for example, in Staphylococcus aureus and L. monocytogenes , a cystathionine β-synthase domain is attached to the EgtV C terminus and modulates ATPase activity by binding to c-di-AMP, thus regulating transporter function ( Huynh et al., 2016 46. Huynh, T.N. ∙ Choi, P.H. ∙ Sureka, K. ... Cyclic di-AMP targets the cystathionine beta-synthase domain of the osmolyte transporter OpuC Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 102 :233-243 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schuster et al., 2016 89. Schuster, C.F. ∙ Bellows, L.E. ∙ Tosi, T. ... The second messenger c–di-amp inhibits the osmolyte uptake system OpuC in Staphylococcus aureus Sci. Signal. 2016; 9 :ra81 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional proteins that facilitate EGT uptake, such as the putative outer membrane porin that permits EGT import by Gram-negative bacteria, remain to be discovered.
Interestingly, many EgtUV homologs are present in bacteria that produce other LMW thiols. Similarly, EGT biosynthetic genes co-occur in some species that synthesize GSH or mycothiol. These findings suggest LMW-thiol biosynthesis and EGT uptake may be differentially regulated or that internalized EGT can carry out functions distinct from those of LMW thiols synthesized de novo . Indeed, EGT is known to regulate other important aspects of microbial physiology, such as conidial formation in fungi and energy metabolism in mycobacteria ( Bello et al., 2012 12. Bello, M.H. ∙ Barrera-Perez, V. ∙ Morin, D. ... The Neurospora crassa mutant Nc Δ Egt-1 identifies an ergothioneine biosynthetic gene and demonstrates that ergothioneine enhances conidial survival and protects against peroxide toxicity during conidial germination Fungal Genet.

Ergothioneine maintains redox and bioenergetic homeostasis essential for drug susceptibility and virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :572-585 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, Chryseobacterium hominis , a recently discovered Gram-negative bacterium that was isolated from human blood ( Vaneechoutte et al., 2007 103. Vaneechoutte, M. ∙ Kämpfer, P. ∙ De Baere, T. ... Chryseobacterium hominis sp. nov., to accommodate clinical isolates biochemically similar to CDC groups II-h and II-c Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2007; 57 :2623-2628 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), encodes adjacent EGT transport and biosynthetic genes, suggesting that EGT is particularly important to its life cycle. Additional studies are needed to establish the functional contributions of EGT to microbes in vivo , which may clarify why certain bacteria devote considerable resources to the ATP-driven import of EGT while synthesizing other LMW thiols.
Although our sequence-based search uncovered several EGT-transporting microorganisms, certain EgtUV homologs (e.g., S. enterica OsmYXWV) do not appear to transport EGT, underscoring the limitations of our bioinformatic approach. For certain betaine-binding proteins, like E. coli ProX ( Schiefner et al., 2004a 86. Schiefner, A. ∙ Breed, J. ∙ Bösser, L. ... Cation-pi interactions as determinants for binding of the compatible solutes glycine betaine and proline betaine by the periplasmic ligand-binding protein ProX from Escherichia coli J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :5588-5596 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is clear that EGT cannot be accommodated by the ligand-binding site. W140 of E. coli ProX emerges from the front of the binding pocket ( Figure S6 C), where the trimethylammonium group of glycine betaine is accessible. In H. pylori EgtU, however, this region is occupied by the thioimidazole moiety of EGT, and the betaine-binding residues Y390 and Y493 instead reside at the back of the pocket ( Figure S6 C). The orientation of betaine box residues in E. coli ProX is consistent with this protein’s ability to bind smaller betaine compounds, whereas the ligand-binding site of EgtU is configured to accommodate the larger betaine compound EGT. However, the arrangement of the betaine box residues alone is insufficient to predict whether a particular SBD can bind EGT ( Figures 5 D and S7 ). Other residues, such as EgtU R454, may play a role in determining ligand specificity. Therefore, additional studies are needed to functionally validate putative EGT transport proteins.
Numerous studies have implicated EGT as a protective biomarker with a broad role in disease prevention. Reduced levels of EGT are associated with aging and frailty ( Cheah et al., 2016 16.

Serum metabolomics identifies altered bioenergetics, signaling cascades in parallel with exposome markers in Crohn’s disease Molecules. 2019; 24 :449 Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar ). Similarly, treatment with EGT has been found to improve cognitive function and stimulate neuronal differentiation ( Nakamichi et al., 2021 65. Nakamichi, N. ∙ Nakao, S. ∙ Nishiyama, M. ...

Discovery of the ergothioneine transporter Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :5256-5261 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar ), and several studies have found that EGT restricts the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( Rahman et al., 2003 76.

Genet. 2003; 35 :341-348 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the contribution of these SNPs to Crohn’s disease is debated ( Huff et al., 2012 45. Huff, C.D. ∙ Witherspoon, D.J. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Crohn's disease and genetic hitchhiking at IBD5 Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29 :101-111 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, slc22a4 expression was shown to increase over the course of murine infancy ( Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2015 78. Rakoff-Nahoum, S. ∙ Kong, Y. ∙ Kleinstein, S.H. ... Analysis of gene-environment interactions in postnatal development of the mammalian intestine Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :1929-1936 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), a critical window of time for the maturation of the microbiota. The upregulation of slc22a4 was dependent on functional Toll-like receptor signaling, suggesting that immune recognition of microbial signals regulates OCTN1 expression during postnatal development. Given its anti-inflammatory properties, EGT may facilitate immune adaptation to gut commensals and potentially inhibit the onset of inflammatory bowel diseases associated with dysbiosis of the intestinal flora.
Considering the widespread distribution of egtUV in the microbiome and the expression of OCTN1 throughout the gastrointestinal tract ( Taubert et al., 2009 94. Taubert, D. ∙ Jung, N. ∙ Goeser, T. ... Increased ergothioneine tissue concentrations in carriers of the Crohn's disease risk-associated 503F variant of the organic cation transporter OCTN1 Gut. 2009; 58 :312-314 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Uhlén et al., 2015 99. Uhlén, M. ∙ Fagerberg, L. ∙ Hallström, B.M. ... Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome Science. 2015; 347 :1260419 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), our results imply that microbes compete with host cells and with each other for EGT uptake. The mammalian EGT transporter OCTN1, a member of the solute carrier (SLC) 22 protein family, contains a membrane-embedded ligand-binding site and translocates sodium ions and EGT in tandem via a mechanism of sodium symport ( Volk, 2014 105. Volk, C. OCTs, OATs, and OCTNs: structure and function of the polyspecific organic ion transporters of the SLC22 family Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Membr. Transp. Signal. 2014; 3 :1-13 Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar ). By contrast, the microbial EgtUV transporter utilizes an SBD to deliver EGT to a transmembrane permease domain, which then translocates EGT into the cytosol in a process driven by ATP hydrolysis. The distinct mechanisms employed by these two transporters suggest that they evolved convergently to acquire EGT and may differ in transport efficiency. Similarly, the diverse architectures of EgtUV orthologs hint at variable regulation of EGT uptake that may influence interspecies competition for this metabolite in vivo .
In addition to EGT transport, microbial metabolism may restrict host access to dietary EGT, which is present in both the small and large intestines ( Kato et al., 2010 52. Kato, Y. ∙ Kubo, Y. ∙ Iwata, D. ... Gene knockout and metabolome analysis of carnitine/organic cation transporter OCTN1 Pharm. Res. 2010; 27 :832-840 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, our data suggest that EGT is commonly degraded by HF samples and can contribute to TMA production in the host ( Figures 7 B and 7C). We hypothesize that interpersonal differences in microbiome composition influence the metabolic fate of EGT. In turn, the abundance of EGT in the host diet may influence the composition of the gut microbiota, with the consumption of EGT-rich foods likely favoring microorganisms that can import or metabolize this small molecule. Notably, EGT and TMAO, which is generated via oxidation of TMA in the liver, are inversely correlated with cardiovascular health: high levels of EGT in the blood are strongly associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease ( Smith et al., 2020 92. Smith, E. ∙ Ottosson, F. ∙ Hellstrand, S. ... Ergothioneine is associated with reduced mortality and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease Heart. 2020; 106 :691-697 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas high levels of TMAO are associated with elevated risk ( Fennema et al., 2016 29. Fennema, D. ∙ Phillips, I.R. ∙ Shephard, E.A. Trimethylamine and trimethylamine N -oxide, a Flavin-containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-mediated host-microbiome metabolic axis implicated in health and disease Drug Metab.

Trimethylamine N -oxide: the good, the bad and the unknown Toxins. 2016; 8 :326 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, the production of TMA from EGT by the gut microbiota could be detrimental to human health. EGT degradation can also generate hydrogen sulfide, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration and exacerbates inflammatory processes at high concentrations ( Beliaeva et al., 2021 11. Beliaeva, M.A. ∙ Leisinger, F. ∙ Seebeck, F.P. In vitro Reconstitution of a Five-Step Pathway for Bacterial Ergothioneine Catabolism ACS Chem. Biol. 2021; 16 :397-403 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rahman et al., 2020 77. Rahman, M.A. ∙ Glasgow, J.N. ∙ Nadeem, S. ... The role of host-generated H 2 S in microbial pathogenesis: new perspectives on tuberculosis Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2020; 10 :586923 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Walsh and Giedroc, 2020 106. Walsh, B.J.C. ∙ Giedroc, D.P. H 2 S and reactive sulfur signaling at the host-bacterial pathogen interface J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 :13150-13168 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hydrogen sulfide can also directly promote pathogen expansion during intestinal inflammation by supporting alternative respiratory pathways in the gut ( Winter et al., 2010 112. Winter, S.E. ∙ Thiennimitr, P. ∙ Winter, M.G. ... Gut inflammation provides a respiratory electron acceptor for Salmonella Nature. 2010; 467 :426-429 Crossref Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microbial catabolism of EGT could thus increase the risk of inflammation-associated intestinal or neurological disorders by stunting the anti-inflammatory effects of EGT in vivo , while also producing byproducts that negatively impact human health.
In summary, although genome-mining analyses have been instrumental to studies of LMW-thiol biosynthesis, our work underscores the value of reactivity-guided metabolomics for the unbiased discovery of protective thiols that may be acquired by other means. The microbial EgtUV transporter is a widely conserved mechanism of redox regulation in host-associated microbes, including the major bacterial carcinogen H. pylori . Interspecies competition for dietary EGT has the potential to broadly influence various aspects of host physiology, including inflammatory responses, neurobiology, and cardiovascular health, as well as the microbial ecology of the gut. Finally, because the mechanisms of EGT transport by bacterial and mammalian cells are entirely distinct, EgtU may be an attractive target for the development of broad-spectrum inhibitors that selectively block EGT import by gastrointestinal microbes in the host.
This study provides evidence of one important role for EGT in H. pylori —protection against the neutrophil-derived oxidant bleach. However, our findings suggest EGT constitutes a nexus that bridges the antioxidant response, cellular sulfur economy, and microbial metabolism in vivo . Future studies should resolve how such factors, as well as the spatial distribution of EGT in gastrointestinal tissues, influence the colonization dynamics and gland occupancy of WT versus EgtUV-deficient H. pylori in the stomach. Additionally, whether EgtUV directly contributes to EGT metabolism by gut bacteria is unknown. Identifying the strains responsible for degrading EGT in HF samples, and determining whether EGT catabolism contributes to disease etiology, warrants further investigation and will deepen our understanding of how EGT shapes host-microbe interactions.

Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are summarized in Tables S4–S6 . H. pylori strains were grown as previously described ( Salama et al., 2001 85. Salama, N.R. ∙ Otto, G. ∙ Tompkins, L. ... Vacuolating cytotoxin of Helicobacter pylori plays a role during colonization in a mouse model of infection Infect. Immun. 2001; 69 :730-736 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, H. pylori was cultured at 37 °C under microaerophilic conditions using a 2.5 L gas pack jar containing a CampyGen sachet or a humidified incubator set to 10% CO 2 . Broth cultures were prepared using Brucella broth supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS; Gibco, Catalog no. 16140071). H. pylori was also cultured on Columbia blood agar (Oxoid) plates supplemented with 5% (v/v) horse blood (VWR) and 10 μg/mL vancomycin hydrochloride, 5 μg/mL cefsulodin sodium hydrate, 0.33 μg/mL polymyxin B sulfate, 50 μg/mL cycloheximide, 10 μg/mL trimethoprim, 16 μg/mL amphotericin B, and 2 μg/mL β-cyclodextrin. Plates were further supplemented with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol, 50 μ g /mL kanamycin, 36 μg/mL metronidazole, 90 μ g /mL vancomycin hydrochloride, 10 μ g /mL nalidixic acid, and/or 100 μ g /mL bacitracin as needed. Campylobacter jejuni was grown under the same conditions as H. pylori . Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was grown in TYG liquid media or on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar plates supplemented with 5% (v/v) horse blood and 200 μg/mL gentamicin sulfate salt in a Coy anaerobic chamber (20% CO 2 , 10% H 2 , and 70% N 2 ) as previously described ( Schofield et al., 2018 88. Schofield, W.B. ∙ Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, M. ∙ Zimmermann, M. ... The stringent response determines the ability of a commensal bacterium to survive starvation and to persist in the gut Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :120-132.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). L. monocytogenes was grown on BHI agar plates supplemented with 200 μ g /mL streptomycin sulfate or in BHI liquid medium. S. enterica , Vibrio cholerae , and E. coli were grown at 37 °C in LB medium or on LB agar plates supplemented with 20 μ g /mL chloramphenicol or 50 μg/mL kanamycin, carbenicillin, or ampicillin as needed. C. difficile was grown on BHI agar plates supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract and 0.1% (w/v) L-cysteine (BHIS) with taurocholate (0.1% (w/v); 1.9 mM), thiamphenicol (10–15 μg/mL), kanamycin (50 μg/mL), or cefoxitin (8 μg/mL) as needed. C. difficile defined medium (CDDM) ( Karasawa et al., 1995 50. Karasawa, T. ∙ Ikoma, S. ∙ Yamakawa, K. ... A defined growth medium for Clostridium difficile Microbiology. 1995; 141 :371-375 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) was supplemented with 5-fluoroorotic acid at 2 mg/mL and uracil at 5 μg/mL. Cultures were grown at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions using a gas mixture containing 85% N 2 , 5% CO 2 and 10% H 2 .
Overnight cultures were prepared by inoculating the appropriate liquid medium with cells from dense patches of bacteria expanded from a single colony ( H. pylori , C. jejuni ) or with a single colony ( E. coli , S. enterica , V. cholerae , B. thetaiotaomicron , L. monocytogenes ). Cultures were grown for 16–18 h at 37 °C with shaking at 100 r.p.m. ( H. pylori , C. jejuni ), 250 r.p.m. ( E. coli , S. enterica , V. cholerae , L. monocytogenes ), or as static cultures ( B. thetaiotaomicron ). Starter cultures of C. difficile were prepared by inoculating BHIS broth with a single colony, followed by static incubation at 37 °C for 3 h under anaerobic conditions. Unless otherwise specified, cultures were subsequently diluted into fresh medium as follows: H. pylori and C. jejuni cultures were diluted to a starting OD 600 of 0.1; E. coli , S. enterica , L. monocytogenes and V. cholerae were diluted 1:1000; B. thetaiotaomicron was diluted 1:100; C. difficile was diluted 1:50. For assays testing for EGT biosynthesis, H. pylori cultures were supplemented with 1 mM His or Met, or with 0.2 mM Cys, as higher concentrations of Cys inhibited H. pylori growth. For assays testing for biosynthetic incorporation of 13 C-Met into EGT, H. pylori cultures were supplemented with 10 mM Met or 13 C-Met. For EGT-d 3 transport assays, H. pylori cultures were supplemented with 0, 1, or 5 μg of EGT-d 3 , whereas E. coli , S. enterica , V. cholerae , C. jejuni , B. thetaiotaomicron , L. monocytogenes , and C. difficile cultures were supplemented with 0.2 μg/mL of EGT-d 3 . Cultures of E. coli and S. enterica strains containing pBAD vectors were supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) L-arabinose to induce protein expression. To estimate EGT concentrations in H. pylori , cells were approximated as cylinders (V = πr 2 l) with l = 3.5 μm and r = 0.5 μm.
Human gastric epithelial AGS cells (ATCC CRL-1739; derived from a female patient) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) HI-FBS at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator.
All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were group housed and randomly assigned to experimental groups. Animals were monitored daily by veterinary staff from the Yale Animal Resources Center.
Human fecal samples from 25 healthy individuals were collected under Yale University Human Investigation Committee protocol number 1106008725 at the Yale University School of Medicine. Information regarding age, gender, eligibility criteria, and collection/storage methods were reported previously ( Goodman et al., 2011 35. Goodman, A.L. ∙ Kallstrom, G. ∙ Faith, J.J. ...

H. pylori mutant strains were generated by natural transformation with a linear PCR construct or genomic DNA (gDNA) containing the flanking regions of the targeted gene and a kanamycin or chloramphenicol resistance cassette as previously described ( Salama et al., 2001 85. Salama, N.R. ∙ Otto, G. ∙ Tompkins, L. ... Vacuolating cytotoxin of Helicobacter pylori plays a role during colonization in a mouse model of infection Infect. Immun. 2001; 69 :730-736 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Complemented strains were generated by naturally transforming the relevant mutant strain with a linear PCR product or plasmid containing the full coding region of the relevant gene followed by a kanamycin or chloramphenicol resistance cassette. The transformed construct replaced the antibiotic resistance cassette at the native locus of the gene. To complement mutant strains at a nonnative site, genes were cloned into vector pLC292, which contains the coding region of the H. pylori rdxA gene with an internal multiple cloning site ( Terry et al., 2005 95. Terry, K. ∙ Williams, S.M. ∙ Connolly, L. ... Chemotaxis plays multiple roles during Helicobacter pylori animal infection Infect. Immun. 2005; 73 :803-811 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). The plasmid was then transformed into the appropriate H. pylori mutant, and the complemented strain was selected via metronidazole resistance, which results from genetic recombination into the endogenous rdxA locus. All H. pylori mutant and complemented strains were verified by locus-specific PCR reactions and DNA sequencing.
H. pylori G27MA HPG27_777::Tn and Δ HPG27_885 were generated by transforming H. pylori G27MA with gDNA from the corresponding H. pylori G27 mutant strain. H. pylori G27 mutant strains were obtained from a previously generated mutant library containing transposon insertion mutants marked with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( cat ) cassette (e.g., HPG27_777::Tn ) and targeted deletion mutants marked with the cat cassette (e.g., Δ HPG27_885 ) ( Yang et al., 2019 115. Yang, D.C. ∙ Blair, K.M. ∙ Taylor, J.A. ... A genome-wide Helicobacter pylori morphology screen uncovers a membrane-spanning helical cell shape domplex J. Bacteriol. 2019; 201 e00724–e00718 Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar ).
To construct H. pylori G27MA Δ egtU , the 500-bp DNA sequences flanking HPG27_777 (GenBank ACI27532.1) were amplified from H. pylori G27MA gDNA using primers DD-75 and DD-76 (upstream flank) and DD-78 and DD-105 (downstream flank). The Campylobacter coli cat cassette was amplified from H. pylori G27MA Δ cagA gDNA (gift of Manuel Amieva, Stanford University School of Medicine) using primers DD-73 and DD-104. A consensus H. pylori ribosome binding site (TCTAAGGAGAAT) was added to the 3' end of the cat cassette to maintain translation of the downstream HPG27_778 gene. The resulting PCR products were gel-purified and assembled into a single linear construct via splicing by overlap extension PCR using primers DD-75 and DD-78, and the product was transformed into WT H. pylori G27MA.
To construct H. pylori G27MA Δ egtV , the 500-bp DNA sequences flanking HPG27_778 (GenBank ACI27533.1) were amplified from H. pylori G27MA gDNA using primers DD-79 and DD-80 (upstream flank) and DD-81 and DD-82 (downstream flank). The C. coli cat cassette was amplified from H. pylori G27MA Δ cagA gDNA using primers DD-73 and DD-74.

The overall secondary structure of purified EgtU SBD was analyzed by CD using an Applied Photophysics Chirascan V100 instrument. Purified protein was buffer-exchanged from HEPES into PBS using 3 kDa MWCO Pierce™ Protein Concentrators (Thermo Fisher) via centrifugation for 30-min intervals at 4 °C and 15,000 x g . Protein was either used directly, or if thawed from frozen, centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 20,000 x g to pellet any precipitate. A sample of supernatant was taken and denatured in 7.5 M guanidine hydrochloride and absorbance at 280 nm was measured. The concentration was determined using Beer’s law with an extinction coefficient of 27,390 M –1 cm –1 . The protein was diluted to 15 μM in 400 μL total volume of PBS and loaded into a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette (Starna Cells). CD spectroscopy absorbance measurements were conducted at 20 °C from 190 – 300 nm wavelengths with a 1-nm step and 2-sec averaging time, resulting in 80,000 independent 25-μsec measurements. Measurements were performed in duplicate for each mutant, and data were corrected using a PBS blank. The raw absorbance (millidegrees, θ) was converted to Mean Residue Ellipticity ([θ]MR) using the following equation: [θ]MR = (100 x θ) / ((C x N) x I), where C is the molar protein concentration, N is the number of amino acids, and I is the cell path length in centimeters ( Greenfield, 2006 36.

Overnight cultures of WT, Δ egtV , and Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori PMSS1 were grown for 16–18 h at 37 °C, diluted to OD 600 0.01 in fresh medium, and grown for an additional 21 h at 37 °C. CFU were measured immediately after subculturing (t=0) and again after 4, 8, or 21 h of growth. For coculture assays, overnight cultures of WT, Δ egtV , and Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori PMSS1 were diluted to OD 600 0.01 in fresh medium and combined pairwise in 1:1 mixtures (final OD 600 0.02). CFU were measured immediately after subculturing (t=0) and again after 4, 8, or 21 h of growth. CFU were enumerated on nonselective and chloramphenicol- or kanamycin-containing plates. The total CFU in each coculture were determined using nonselective plates, whereas the CFU of the Δ egtV and Δ egtV::egtV strains were determined using chloramphenicol- or kanamycin-containing plates, respectively. WT H. pylori CFU were determined by subtracting the number of CFU on selective media from the total CFU.
AGS cells were seeded in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) HI-FBS using 100-mm tissue-culture treated plates (Corning) at 10 6 cells per dish. After 3 days, the cell culture medium was replaced with 10 mL fresh medium supplemented with EGT-d 3 (1 μg/mL) or vehicle control (ddH 2 O). Following a 24-h incubation, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS; HyClone) and covered with 10 mL co-culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) Brucella broth and 5% (v/v) HI-FBS). 1 mL of the co-culture medium was transferred to an Eppendorf tube, cleared by centrifugation (21,000 x g , 2 min, room temperature), and the supernatant was stored at –80 °C until further analysis (t=0 h sample, Figure 3 D). Exponential-phase liquid cultures of H. pylori were pelleted by centrifugation (3,180 x g , 5 min, room temperature) and resuspended in Brucella broth supplemented with 10% (v/v) HI-FBS to an OD 600 of 2. Bacterial resuspensions were added to the AGS cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, and the infected cells were incubated in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 °C for 10 h. An equal volume of 10% (v/v) HI-FBS in Brucella broth was used as a mock infection control. After 10 h, 1 mL of conditioned medium from mock- and H. pylori- infected cells was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and cleared by centrifugation (21,000 x g , 2 min, room temperature). The clarified supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and stored at –80 °C until further analysis ( Figure 3 C; t=10 h sample, Figure 3 D). To isolate H. pylori , the remaining conditioned medium (∼9 mL) from H. pylori- infected AGS cell cultures was transferred to a conical tube, AGS cells were washed twice with DPBS, and washes were collected in the same tube. The combined conditioned media and DPBS washes were then centrifuged at low speed (300 x g , 3 min, room temperature) to pellet any mammalian cells, and the supernatant was then transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged again (3,000 x g , 5 min, room temperature) to pellet H. pylori . Cells were resuspended in 1 mL PBS to measure CFU and were then pelleted (3,000 x g , 5 min, room temperature) and stored at –80 °C until further analysis ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Following the washes, AGS cells were treated with 400 μg/mL kanamycin and 160 μg/mL chloramphenicol in DMEM for 1 h, and then washed again with DPBS. Cells were collected via dissociation by TrypLE Express (Gibco) and pelleted by centrifugation (300 x g , 3 min, room temperature in 15-mL conical tubes (Corning); then 21,000 x g , 2 min, room temperature in Eppendorf tubes), and then resuspended in PBS for enumeration via the Trypan Blue (Thermo) exclusion test using a Countess II FL automated cell counter (Applied Biosystems). Then cells were pelleted (21,000 x g , 2 min, room temperature) and stored at –80 °C until further analysis ( Figure 3 B).
For single infections, ten mice per time point (1, 8, or 16 weeks) were orally infected with 10 8 CFU of mid-exponential-phase cultures of H. pylori PMSS1 WT, Δ egtV , or Δ egtV::egtV , and five mice were mock-infected with media alone. For competition experiments, eight mice per group were infected for 2 weeks with equal mixtures of WT and Δ egtV or Δ egtV and Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori PMSS1 for a total of 10 8 CFU per animal. Mice were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation at 1-, 2-, 8-, or 16-weeks post-infection. After removal of the forestomach, the remaining stomach tissue was dissected, weighed, and homogenized in Brucella broth using a bead beater (BioSpec) prior to measuring CFU. For single infections, the stomach was dissected into two pieces: one half for CFU determination, and one half for histopathologic analysis.
To measure the EGT content of murine gastric tissue and digested chow isolated from mouse stomachs, six mice were mock-infected with media alone (5 μL DMEM) to mimic infection conditions and then euthanized after two weeks. Mice were dissected, the food content of the stomach was gently scraped and added to a tube containing 1 mL PBS, and then the stomach was washed with PBS and collected in 1 mL PBS. Mouse chow (2018 Teklad Global) was homogenized and the powder (50 mg) was added to a tube containing 1 mL PBS. Samples were supplemented with 1 μg EGT-d 9 and then homogenized using a bead beater. 100 μL of each mixture was added to 400 μL thiol extraction buffer and EGT levels were measured as described before.
Half of the excised stomach (containing the corpus and antrum) from 35 total mice either mock-infected (N=5) or infected with WT, Δ egtV , or Δ egtV::egtV H. pylori PMSS1 (N=10 mice per condition) for 16 weeks were immersion-fixed for 24 h in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and then trimmed, transferred to 70% (v/v) ethanol, and submitted for routine processing, embedding, sectioning and staining for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to the Histology Service in the Comparative Pathology Research Core (Department of Comparative Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine). The H&E-stained sections of stomachs were examined blind to experimental manipulation and scored by semiquantitative analysis adapted from published methods for edema, inflammation, gland loss, and gland hyperplasia ( Montgomery et al., 2007 63. Montgomery, R.R. ∙ Booth, C.J. ∙ Wang, X. ... Recruitment of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in Lyme carditis Infect. Immun. 2007; 75 :613-620 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; O'Connor et al., 2009 69. O'Connor, Jr., W. ∙ Kamanaka, M. ∙ Booth, C.J. ... A protective function for interleukin 17A in T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10 :603-609 Crossref Scopus (619) PubMed Google Scholar ). Severity scores ranged from 0–5 as follows: 0, within normal limits or absent; 1, minimal; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, marked; 5, severe. Severity of injury represents the total additive score for each mouse.
Protein domains and functions were predicted using BLASTp, BioCyc, or InterProScan based upon sequence homology to characterized proteins. Prediction of membrane protein topology was performed using the TOPCONS online web server. Protein sequence identities and similarities were calculated using BLASTp. Homologs to the predicted solute-binding portion of HPG27_777 (aa 282–553) were identified using BLASTp (alignment score ≥100). Protein sequences were aligned with Promals3D. Geneious Prime 8 was used to align solute-binding domains using global alignment with free end gaps, and then a protein phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining tree building method and Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model. Phylogenetic trees were further customized using iTOL v6.
EGT-d 9 metabolism assays were performed under anaerobic conditions (20% CO 2 , 10% H 2 , and 70% N 2 ) in a Coy anaerobic chamber. Human fecal samples (100 μL) were mixed with 675 μL buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.8) containing 25 μL EGT-d 9 (1 mg/mL stock) or an equal volume of buffer alone and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Samples were then spiked with internal standard (1 μg EGT-d 3 ), and 100 μL of each reaction mixture were mixed with 400 μL thiol extraction buffer to quantify EGT-d 9 by LC–MS, or with 400 μL 95% (v/v) ACN with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid to quantify TMA-d 9 . Samples for the quantification of EGT-d 9 were then treated with mBBr as described above; samples for the quantification of TMA-d 9 were centrifuged (10 min, 21,000 x g , room temperature) and the supernatant was removed and stored at 4 °C until LC–MS analysis.
All quantitative experiments were performed in technical triplicate and were repeated a minimum of three times unless otherwise specified. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.1.2. Details regarding statistical parameters are described in the figure legends.
