Title: Efficient treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis in rhesus macaques by an HIV fusion-inhibitory lipopeptide


Abstract: Summary

Two HIV fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides (LP-97 and LP-98) were designed with highly potent, long-acting antiviral activity. Monotherapy using a low dose of LP-98 sharply reduced viral loads and maintained long-term viral suppression in 21 SHIV SF162P3 -infected rhesus macaques. We found that five treated monkeys achieved potential posttreatment control (PTC) efficacy and had lower viral DNA in deep lymph nodes, whereas monkeys with a stable viral rebound had higher viral DNA in superficial lymph nodes. The tissues of PTC monkeys exhibited significantly decreased quantitative viral outgrowth and fewer PD-1 + central memory CD4 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells contributed to virologic control efficacy. Moreover, LP-98 administrated as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provided complete protection against SHIV SF162P3 and SIVmac239 infections in 51 monkeys via intrarectal, intravaginal, or intravenous challenge. In conclusion, our lipopeptides exhibit high potential as an efficient HIV treatment or prevention strategy.

Section: Introduction

Due to the absence of a preventive vaccine, extensive and effective treatments for human-immunodeficiency-virus-positive (HIV + ) individuals play essential roles in controlling the AIDS epidemic. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with multiple drugs can efficiently suppress HIV replication in infected individuals and has thus dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality rates of AIDS. However, HAART cannot eradicate HIV from the cellular reservoir of a quiescent but replication-competent virus, thus requiring lifelong treatment, which can result in cumulative toxicities and drug resistance ( Barré-Sinoussi et al., 2013 2.

Although there are substantial challenges to overcome in the development of an HIV cure or functional HIV cure, two antiviral strategies have shed light on potential curative methods. First, the “Berlin patient” and “London patient” cases demonstrated that the infusion of HIV-resistant cells, whether naturally occurring or created through gene editing, may provide a viable treatment approach. Second, discontinuation of HAART would result in rapid viral rebound and disease progression, but sustained control of HIV replication, which is defined as posttreatment control (PTC), occurs in a subset of treated individuals ( Etemad et al., 2019 15.

Although latent HIV cannot be completely eliminated, the PTC cases suggested that effective treatment can lead to HIV suppression without drugs. It is fundamentally important to characterize the latent HIV reservoir, the virologic and immunologic correlates of viral rebound, and the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of viremic control after treatment interruption, as therapeutic interventions utilizing manipulation of these characteristics can lead to sustained drug-free HIV remission, which is among the top priorities of the HIV field.
HIV infection requires a fusion between the viral envelope (Env) and host cell membrane, which is mediated by the Env glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41 ( Chan and Kim, 1998 4. Chan, D.C. ∙ Kim, P.S. HIV entry and its inhibition Cell. 1998; 93 :681-684 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1139) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eckert and Kim, 2001 13. Eckert, D.M. ∙ Kim, P.S. Mechanisms of viral membrane fusion and its inhibition Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70 :777-810 Crossref Scopus (1165) PubMed Google Scholar ). The surface subunit gp120 is responsible for binding to the cell receptor CD4 and a coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4), whereas the transmembrane subunit gp41 mediates membrane fusion; both proteins undergo large conformational changes. Peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat region (CHR) of gp41 can form six-helix bundle (6HB)-like assemblies with the extended N-terminal heptad repeat region (NHR), thus preventing refolding of the viral 6-HB ( Chan and Kim, 1998 4.

The peptide drug enfuvirtide (T-20) is the only US-Food-and-Drug-Administration-approved viral membrane fusion inhibitor and has been used for HIV-1 combination therapy, but it has low antiviral activity and a genetic barrier to inducing drug resistance ( Lalezari et al., 2003 21.

In the past decade, we have dedicated substantial research efforts toward the discovery of HIV fusion inhibitors with improved pharmaceutical profiles, which led to the development of a group of lipopeptides with highly potent, long-lasting anti-HIV activity ( Chong et al., 2015 5.

In this study, we characterized two lipopeptides, LP-97 and LP-98, which were modified with cholesterol and exhibit extremely potent in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo anti-HIV efficacies. Monotherapy with low-dose LP-98 efficiently suppressed simian/human immunodeficiency chimeric virus (SHIV) strain SHIV SF162P3 replication in rhesus macaques and achieved potential PTC efficacy in a subset of treated monkeys. The virologic and immunologic correlates associated with the LP-98 treatment were further investigated and achieved significant findings. Moreover, we demonstrated that single-dose administration of LP-98 can potentially protect rhesus macaques from SHIV SF162P3 or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strain SIVmac239 infections through intrarectal, intravaginal, or intravenous challenges.

Section: Results

We previously developed diverse HIV fusion inhibitors, with lipopeptides LP-80 and LP-83 being the most potent inhibitors ( Figure S1 ). To develop a more efficient inhibitor for clinical studies, here, we generated two lipopeptides, LP-97 and LP-98, in which N-terminal tyrosine (Y) was adopted to avoid potential complications by oxidation of tryptophan (W) and C-terminal cholesterol was conjugated via a cysteine residue or directly with the side chain of lysine ( Figure 1 A). The structural properties and binding stabilities of LP-97 and LP-98 along with control inhibitors (T-20, LP-80, and LP-83) were determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Four lipopeptides, but not T-20, displayed a typical α-helical conformation with high thermostability and interacted with NHR-derived target mimic peptides (N39 or N42) to form very stable helical bundle complexes ( Figures S2 A and S2B).
The anti-HIV activity of lipopeptides along with control inhibitors was comprehensively characterized. First, we demonstrated that LP-80, LP-83, LP-97, and LP-98 had extremely potent activities in inhibiting three replication-competent HIV-1 strains, including CXCR4-tropic NL4-3, CCR5-tropic JRCSF, and dual-tropic 89.6, with mean IC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values ranging from 0.28 pM to 7.31 pM ( Figure 1 B). Unexpectedly, LP-98 inhibited divergent HIV-1 in three target cells, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), C8166, and MT-4, with mean IC 50 values of ∼0.03–0.58 pM; in sharp contrast, the IC 50 values of T-20 and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors (AZT and 3TC) were at nM levels ( Figure 1 C). A large panel of HIV-1 pseudoviruses with primary Envs derived from different subtypes and phenotypes was also applied, which verified the super potency of the lipopeptides ( Table S1 ). Moreover, the inhibitors were highly active against HIV-1 Env-mediated cell–cell fusion ( Table S2 ) as well as infections of HIV-2, SIV, SHIV, and T-20-resistant HIV-1 mutants ( Table S3 ). The cytotoxicity of lipopeptides was determined in human PBMCs and different cell lines, which indicated extremely high therapeutic indices ( Tables S4 and S5 ). We also demonstrated that the inhibitory activity of LP-98 was not affected by pre-incubation with human or monkey sera or by human serum albumin and that a scrambled peptide LP-98S (shown in Figure S1 ) had no anti-HIV function ( Figure S2 C).
In a pharmacokinetic study, LP-98 exhibited a half-life ( t 1/2 ) of ∼10 h in rats; however, plasma LP-98 was still detectable after injection several days with much higher concentrations relative to its antiviral IC 50 values ( Figures S2 D and S2E). At 72 h postinjection, the 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg groups of rats had mean plasma LP-98 concentrations of 2.71, 6.28, and 12.12 nM, respectively, which are 5,894-, 13,662-, and 26,338-fold higher than the mean IC 50 (0.46 pM) measured against divergent infectious HIV-1 strains ( Figures 1 B and 1C). After 120 h, LP-98 was still detectable in all of the 8 mg/kg group rats with a mean plasma concentration of 0.75 nM, whereas four of six rats given LP-98 at 4 mg/kg had a mean plasma concentration of 0.52 nM. Considering the limit of detection at 1 ng/mL or 0.25 nM, it was expected that active LP-98 in the rat plasma might persist for an extended period of time.
The anti-HIV activities of LP-97 and LP-98 were validated in six healthy rhesus macaques by subcutaneous administration and ex vivo measurement of serum inhibitory activity over 14 days. LP-97 showed a peak level at 8 h postinjection with a mean dilution of 1,161,429-fold that inhibited 50% of HIV-1 NL4-3 infection. LP-98 had a peak level at 24 h postinjection with a mean dilution of 999,652-fold ( Figure 1 D). LP-97 and LP-98 exhibited comparable antiviral activities at 168 h (7 days) postinjection with mean serum dilutions of 20,381-fold and 23,876-fold, respectively, which were much higher than those of LP-80 (73-fold) and LP-83 (2,229-fold) determined previously ( Chong et al., 2019 9. Chong, H. ∙ Xue, J. ∙ Zhu, Y. ... Monotherapy with a low-dose lipopeptide HIV fusion inhibitor maintains long-term viral suppression in rhesus macaques PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1007552 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2019 33. Zhu, Y. ∙ Chong, H. ∙ Yu, D. ... Design and characterization of cholesterylated peptide HIV-1/2 fusion inhibitors with extremely potent and long-lasting antiviral activity J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e02312-e02318 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, LP-98 appeared to maintain higher serum activity than LP-97 after 168 h. At 240 h (10 days) postinjection, the serum inhibitory activity of LP-98 was approximately five times higher than that of LP-97 (3,417-fold versus 655-fold). At 312 h (13 days) postinjection, LP-98 continued to inhibit the virus efficiently, as indicated by a 254-fold serum dilution. In sharp contrast, the antiviral peaks of T-20 and its lipid derivative LP-40 were at ∼40-fold dilutions with a rapid wane at 6 h postinjection ( Figure 1 E).
We previously reported that low-dose LP-80 monotherapy provided long-term viral suppression in five chronically SHIV SF162P3 -infected rhesus macaques, and viral rebound was observed in four of those monkeys after drug withdrawal ( Chong et al., 2019 9. Chong, H. ∙ Xue, J. ∙ Zhu, Y. ... Monotherapy with a low-dose lipopeptide HIV fusion inhibitor maintains long-term viral suppression in rhesus macaques PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1007552 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Herein, of two monkeys who were weekly or bi-weekly administrated with LP-98 at 3 mg/kg of body weight for three rounds ( Table S6 ) aimed to fully suppress virus replication, the rebounded viruses ranged from 3.65 to 4.95 log 10 RNA copies/mL post-three rounds of treatment ( Figure 2 A). An intriguing phenomenon was that one monkey (K5) had maintained viral remission until at least a 2-year follow-up.
To validate the therapeutic efficacy of LP-98 and explore the potential mechanism underlying PTC efficacy, 18 rhesus macaques challenged with SHIV SF162P3 were utilized in models of LP-98-treated SHIV infections ( Table S6 ). Twelve monkeys were subcutaneously or intramuscularly treated for two rounds with a dose of 2 or 3 mg/kg LP-98 administered weekly ( Figures 2 B and 2C), and six monkeys were intramuscularly injected at a dose of 3 mg/kg LP-98 weekly for a single round of 14 weeks ( Figure 2 D). As shown, viral loads in plasma were sustainably suppressed below the limit of detection with a sequential LP-98 monotherapy. Notably, the potential PTC efficacy was again achieved in four of the treated monkeys ( Figures 2 B and 2C), whereas the other animals experienced a rapid or delayed viral rebound after LP-98 withdrawal from the first or second round of a structured treatment interruption (STI). No significant anti-drug antibodies were detected during treatment, except one monkey (HB6) who showed very weak anti-LP-98 antibody responses in the late stages ( Figure S3 ).
Collectively, we designated 21 monkeys into three groups ( Table S7 ): five monkeys characterized by stable virologic control (SVC), nine monkeys characterized by stable virologic rebound (SVR), and seven monkeys characterized by unstable virologic rebound (UVR) ( Figure 2 E). In comparison, SVC monkeys had significantly lower plasma viremia relative to the SVR group (mean: 3.748 versus 5.086 log 10 copies/mL; p < 0.01; Figure 2 F). However, CD4 + T cell counts and CD4/CD8 T cell ratios showed no significant difference between SVC and SVR or UVR monkeys ( Figure 2 G). Individual plasma viral loads, CD4 + T cell counts, and CD4/CD8 T cell ratios of all five SVC monkeys are shown in Figure 2 H.
To reveal the viral reservoirs associated with LP-98 treatment, we compared the viral DNA levels of various monkey tissues, including PBMCs, lymph nodes (LNs), tonsil, thymus, spleen, gut, brain, heart, liver, stomach, kidney, bone marrow, and testes (male monkeys) from the three SVC, two SVR, and three UVR monkeys. Prior to autopsy, the SVR and UVR monkeys were treated with LP-98 to reduce the interference of viral RNA replication ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The kinetics of viral DNA in PBMCs were longitudinally monitored throughout the sequential LP-98 treatments ( Figure S4 A). The SVC monkeys exhibited significantly lower viral DNA levels compared to the SVR monkeys (2.63 versus 3.19 log 10 copies/μg; p < 0.05; Figure 3 A); however, there were no significant changes in biopsy inguinal LNs ( Figure 3 B). Interestingly, SVR monkeys had higher levels of viral DNA clustered in cervical LNs (5.13 log 10 copies/μg) and axillary LNs (4.44 log 10 copies/μg), UVR monkeys had medium levels of viral DNA in all tested LNs, and SVC monkeys exhibited lower levels of viral DNA clustered in mesenteric LNs (mean: 3.24 log 10 copies/μg) and parenteral LNs (mean: 3.50 log 10 copies/μg; Figure 3 C). Quantitatively, viral DNA from superficial LNs (cervical or axillary LNs) in SVC monkeys was much lower than that of SVR monkeys (cervical LNs: 2.45 versus 5.13 log 10 copies/μg, p < 0.001; axillary LNs: 2.72 versus 4.44 log 10 copies/μg, p < 0.05) or that of UVR monkeys (cervical LNs: 2.45 versus 3.54 log 10 copies/μg; p < 0.05; Figure S4 B). Viral DNA levels in other collected tissues showed no significant difference ( Figure S4 C).
We next conducted a quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). As shown in Figure 4 A, three SVC monkeys had between 0.8 and 1.62 infectious units per million (IUPM) viable PBMC-derived CD4 + T cells, with a median value of 0.87 IUPM, which was slightly lower than that of the SVR monkeys (median: 15.985 IUPM) and UVR monkeys (median: 1.62 IUPM). The viral outgrowth of CD4 + T cells from both superficial and deep LNs in SVC monkeys varied from an IUPM of 0.56 to 1.62 with a median value of 0.81 IUPM, which was much lower than that in SVR and UVR monkeys (≥224.3 IUPM). Of note, the viral outgrowth of CD4 + T cells derived from all tested LNs was below the assay threshold of 0.56 IUPM in one SVC monkey (K5).
Because HIV reservoirs are primarily maintained within memory CD4 + T cells, especially T follicular helper (Tfh) and resting central memory CD4 + T cells (rTcm), we characterized whether the potential PTC status was related to population changes of certain CD4 + T cell subsets. As shown, equivalent proportions of Tfh, rTcm, and CD32 + /PD-1 + /TIGIT + rTcm CD4 + T cell subsets ( Figure S5 A) were measured in PBMCs at pre-, on-, and post-LP-98 treatment, and the percentages of PD-1 + rTcm CD4 + T cell subset in spleen, axillary LNs, and mesenteric LNs in SVC monkeys decreased significantly ( Figure 4 B); however, analyses for tissue samples from multiple time points are required to support a potential viral latency in PD-1 + rTcm CD4 + T cells.
To demonstrate whether the potential PTC efficacy caused by LP-98 is associated with the immune control of CD8 + T cells, we further depleted CD8 + T cells by employing adoptive infusion of anti-CD8 antibody in four UVR and two SVC survivors post-LP-98 cessation ( Figure 4 C). As anticipated, viral rebound was observed in all monkeys. Two SVC monkeys exhibited a relatively low mean peak value of 6.55 log 10 RNA copies/mL in comparison with four UVR survivors whose mean peak value was 7.27 log 10 RNA copies/mL, thus indicating that robust and persistent reactivation of SHIV replication was associated with the depletion of CD8 + T cells. After 20 days of adoptive infusion, the viral RNA declined again along with the recovery of CD8 + T cell counts. Thus, CD8 + T cells in SVC monkeys played critical roles in controlling the levels of replication-competent virus during the remission period without LP-98 treatment.
To explore the mechanisms underlying the roles of CD8 + T cells in LP-98-treated monkeys, we further examined SIV-specific CD8 + T cell responses by stimulating the monkey PBMCs (obtained from the time points after last LP-98 withdrawal) with a SIV-Gag peptide pool. Several upregulated cytokines associated with degranulation (CD107a), cytokine secretion (interferon γ [IFN-γ], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and interleukin-2 [IL-2]), and chemokine production (MIP-1β) were identified by polychromatic flow cytometry. Interestingly, the CD8 + T cells of the SVC monkeys produced more CD107a (p < 0.001) and IFN-γ (p < 0.05) than those of SVR and UVR monkeys ( Figure 4 D). In comparison, SVC monkey cells appeared to be more susceptible to peptide stimulation than SVR and UVR monkey cells, but the total magnitude of SIV-specific responses did not reach statistical significance ( Figure S5 B). Functional combination analysis suggested that SIV-specific CD8 + T cell responses in SVC monkeys were frequently polyfunctional, whereas those from SVR and UVR monkeys were predominantly monofunctional ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Meanwhile, we did not find a significant difference in the proliferation capacities of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, as judged by biomarker Ki67 ( Figure S5 B). Combined, these results provide clues for the PTC efficacy, which has yet to be characterized in depth.
We next evaluated the preventive efficacy of LP-98 in 51 rhesus macaques ( Table S7 ) challenged with SHIV SF162P3 or SIVmac239 through different infection routes. First, a single dose of LP-98 (5 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered to five monkeys either 2 h (PrEP-2h), 1 week (PrEP-1w), or 2 weeks (PrEP-2w) prior to an intravenous challenge with 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infection dose) of SHIV SF162P3 ( Figure 5 A). Unexpectedly, LP-98, when given 2 h and 1 week ahead, showed protection against intravenous injection of the virus in all monkeys, although the infections were stably established in monkeys of the PrEP-2w and solvent control groups ( Figure 5 B). The dynamics of CD4/CD8 ratios ( Figure 5 C) and viral DNA ( Figure 5 D) also confirmed the efficient PrEP efficacy of LP-98 administered 2 h or 1 week in advance, but the effect did not last for 2 weeks. Consistently, necropsy specimens showed high viral DNA copies in various tissues of the control monkeys but no sign of viral infection in monkeys under PrEP-2h or PrEP-1w ( Figure 5 E). Although the PrEP-2w and control monkeys developed high titers of anti-SHIV antibodies, no specific antibodies were detected in the protected animals ( Figure 5 F).
To address whether LP-98 can prevent rectal and vaginal virus transmissions, 20 monkeys were once weekly administered LP-98 (5 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and twice weekly challenged by 500 TCID 50 of SHIV SF162P3 through intrarectal or intravaginal routes ( Figure 6 A). The animals were followed for 22 weeks after initial SHIV SF162P3 exposure and quantified by viral RNA in plasma ( Figure 6 B), CD4/CD8 ratios ( Figure 6 C), viral DNA in PBMCs ( Figure 6 D), and collected tissues ( Figure 6 E), as well as an antibody titer ( Figure 6 F). As shown, pre-administration of LP-98 fully blocked the acquisition of intrarectally and intravaginally challenged viruses, whereas the control monkeys receiving PBS were persistently infected. The QVOA results demonstrated that CD4 + T cells isolated from the LN, spleen, and PBMCs of the monkeys under LP-98 treatment had undetectable viral outgrowth, which greatly differed from those of the control animals having 0.87 to ≥224.3 IUPM in different tissues ( Figure 6 G).
As LP-98 also displayed highly potent activities in inhibiting SIV isolates, we characterized its PrEP efficacy in a monkey model with repetitive mucosal SIVmac239 exposure. In brief, a group of six monkeys were once weekly pre-administrated LP-98 at 10 mg/kg and challenged rectally by 500 TCID 50 of SIVmac239 twice weekly ( Figure 7 A). As indicated by plasma viremia ( Figure 7 B), SIV DNA ( Figure 7 C), and anti-SIV antibodies ( Figure 7 D), during the 5-month observation, LP-98 was fully protective against SIVmac239 infection. To verify the efficacy, three of the monkeys (C1, C4, and C5) were rechallenged intrarectally with the same dose of SIVmac239 at 147 days postinfection (dpi); the remaining three monkeys (C2, C3, and C6) were not rechallenged and served as the control. As anticipated, SIV infection was successfully established in the rechallenged monkeys, whereas the control animals maintained a non-infective state for up to 518 days. Furthermore, we evaluated the preventive effects of LP-98 against intravaginal SIVmac239 transmission, in which five monkeys were similarly given LP-98 (n = 3) or PBS (n = 2) and challenged with the virus ( Figure 7 E). The SIV RNA in plasma ( Figure 7 F), SIV DNA in PBMC ( Figure 7 G), and an antibody titer ( Figure 7 H) verified efficient protection in LP-98-treated monkeys. In contrast, chronic infections were stably established in the PBS-treated control monkeys. Considered together, these results validated the extremely potent preventive and therapeutic efficacies of LP-98.

Section: Discussion

Seven classes of anti-HIV drugs target different steps of the viral life cycle, including (1) binding, (2) fusion, (3) reverse transcription, (4) integration, (5) replication, (6) assembly, and (7) budding. Different from other drugs that act after infection occurs, HIV entry inhibitors, also called fusion inhibitors, block the virus before it invades the target cells by interfering with the binding, fusion, and entry of an HIV virion into a human cell; thus, they provide the advantage of potentially impeding the establishment of viral reservoirs; however, there are only three clinically approved anti-HIV drugs that target the entry process: fusion inhibitor T-20; CCR5 antagonist maraviroc, and anti-CD4 antibody ibalizumab ( https://www.fda.gov ). A CHR peptide-based HIV fusion inhibitor that was approved for clinical use in China displays slightly improved antiviral activity over T-20 but requires once-weekly infusion ( Su et al., 2020 30. Su, B. ∙ Yao, C. ∙ Zhao, Q.X. ..., TALENT Study Team Efficacy and safety of the long-acting fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1: interim analysis of the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study Chin. Med. J. (Engl.). 2020; 133 :2919-2927 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we demonstrated that both LP-97 and LP-98 are extremely potent inhibitors of divergent HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, and SHIV isolates. Their antiviral activities yield impressive IC 50 values approaching low fmol/L concentrations (∼0.03–0.07 pM). By referring to the inhibitory activities of T-20 and the reverse transcription inhibitors AZT and 3TC, which were parallel tested, LP-97 and LP-98 are the most potent and broad-spectrum HIV-1/2 inhibitors that have been characterized so far. In agreement with our previous findings ( Chong et al., 2016 6. Chong, H. ∙ Wu, X. ∙ Su, Y. ...

Virol. 2019; 93 :e02312-e02318 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), lipid conjugation has not only dramatically increased the antiviral activity of fusion-inhibitory peptides but also improved the in vivo stability (half-life), thus producing inhibitors with long-lasting activity. Ingallinella et al. (2009 19. Ingallinella, P. ∙ Bianchi, E. ∙ Ladwa, N.A. ... Addition of a cholesterol group to an HIV-1 peptide fusion inhibitor dramatically increases its antiviral potency Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :5801-5806 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ) previously reported that cholesterol-conjugated HIV-1 fusion inhibitor peptide C34 had markedly improved half-life in C57BL/6 mice ( t 1/2 = 6.5 or 3 h for subcutaneous or intravenous injection), and ∼10% of the injected conjugated peptide was still detectable after 24 h. As shown, the intravenously administrated LP-98 in rats has a t 1/2 of ∼10 h and can maintain high serum concentrations over 5 days; the serum inhibitory activity of the monkey after a low-dose injection of LP-97 or LP-98 can persist up to ∼1 to 2 weeks. Herein, our studies have demonstrated the very high therapeutic efficacy of lipopeptides in chronically infected rhesus macaque models. Encouragingly, once-weekly monotherapy with low-dose LP-98 can fully suppress SHIV replication, thus leading to a subset of monkeys that achieve viral remission even after discontinuation of LP-98. Because LP-98 maintained a similar efficacy during the repeated interruption treatments, it is conceivable that it possesses a very high genetic barrier to inducing drug resistance. Indeed, we have so far failed to select and characterize HIV-1 mutants that are resistant to LP-98, either in vitro or in vivo . Therefore, we conclude that LP-98 has high potential as a drug for clinical development. In our follow-up observation, four SVR monkeys were continuously monitored for more than 2 years and were treated once again with LP-98, leading to additional monkeys with an SVC or UVR status ( Figure S6 ). Taken all together, the data support the therapeutic role of LP-98 with potential to achieve PTC efficacy.
The development of therapeutics that can cure or functionally cure HIV infection seems within reach. For this aim, it is important to characterize the mechanisms underlying the PTC in a subset of treated monkeys as well as the related reservoirs harboring the replication-competent virus. Herein, we focused on characterizing the tissue distribution and level of proviral DNA, CD4 + T cell subsets, and effect of CD8 + T cells in controlling SHIV rebound in treated monkeys. As shown, monkeys with a SVR group had higher viral DNA copies in superficial LNs (neck and axilla); SVC monkeys had lower viral DNA copies in deep LNs (mesentery and parenteral), whereas monkeys of an UVR group had medium levels of viral DNA in both superficial and deep LNs. In comparison, the levels of viral DNA from superficial LNs in SVC monkeys were significantly lower than those of SVR and UVR monkeys. Consistent with this finding, the QVOA revealed robust outgrowth in various LNs of the SVR and UVR monkeys, but not in those of SVC monkeys, which indicates that the majority of total viral DNA in the mesenteric and parenteral LNs of SVC monkeys may be defective due to their lower levels of replication-competent virus. Thus, we consider that SVC monkeys could be sustained by limited viral reservoirs despite the presence of relatively low levels of infected cells harboring replication-competent virus from PBMCs and LNs, and SHIV replication is prone to rebound after LP-98 cessation if proviruses are mainly distributed in superficial LNs; otherwise, the viral rebound can be controlled if the proviruses mainly harbor in deep LNs. For host cells, previous studies showed that latent HIV was enriched in CD4 + T cell populations that express exhaustion markers, and the PTC monkeys exhibited lower levels of PD-1 + CD4 + T cells in LNs ( Fromentin et al., 2016 17. Fromentin, R. ∙ Bakeman, W. ∙ Lawani, M.B. ... CD4+ T cells expressing PD-1, TIGIT and LAG-3 contribute to HIV persistence during ART PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12 :e1005761 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ; Strongin et al., 2020 29. Strongin, Z. ∙ Micci, L. ∙ Fromentin, R. ... Virologic and immunologic features of simian immunodeficiency virus control post-ART interruption in rhesus macaques J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e0033820 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ). Our studies found that LP-98-surpressed SVC monkeys had lower levels of PD-1 + CD4 + rTcm cells in the spleen and axillary and mesenteric LNs than SVR and UVR monkeys, which supports the importance of this cell population in HIV and SIV infection and persistence. It is well known that CD8 + T cells play central roles in controlling HIV and SIV replication. Here, we also verified the importance of CD8 + T cells in LP-98-treated monkeys. Given the complexity of CD8 + T cells in antiviral mechanisms, we extended our studies to analyze their specific immune responses in treated monkeys. As compared to the UVR and SVR groups, the increased levels of CD107a and IFN-γ in the CD8 + T cells of SVC monkeys as well as the polyfunctional effects shed light onto the molecular pathway of the immune-cell-based virus control after LP-98 treatment. We recently performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptome analysis for CD8 + T cells isolated from three response groups. Unexpectedly, functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes showed that the SVC monkeys had upregulated genes associated with the regulation of proteolysis, negative regulation of intracellular signal transduction, and NABA extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins and downregulated genes significantly enriched in immune-system-related processes, such as the immune effector process, lymphocyte activation, positive regulation of immune response, and secretion by cells ( Figure S5 C), which was not the case for UVR and SVR groups. It is a substantial challenge to determine how antiretroviral therapy causes PTC effects, as it is a difficult task to understand the underlying mechanisms of naturally occurring elite HIV-1 controllers and long-term non-progressors. However, here, we hypothesize that, although LP-98 has no capacity to eliminate the latent virus, as a virus entry inhibitor, it may lead to a reduction in the size of the reservoir by blocking the re-infection of progeny viruses, thus favoring the functionality of diverse immune cells.
Despite tremendous efforts, no effective vaccine or topical microbicide has been successful. Truvada, formulated with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine), is currently used for PrEP in individuals with high risk; however, this drug must be taken daily and is not suitable for urgent use. Herein, our studies demonstrated that LP-98 has extremely potent blocking efficacy against the acquisition of SHIV SF162P3 and SIVmac239 through different challenge routes. Ideally, such a lipopeptide can be used urgently with effects that last up to 1 week. In summary, super-potent HIV fusion inhibitor lipopeptides can be developed for clinical use with high potential to achieve PTC efficacy and can be applied as a tool for exploring latent HIV reservoirs. Currently, LP-80 (Lipovirtide) has been advanced to clinical trials (NCT04592315); LP-98 is in the pre-investigational new drug stage. We expect that the observed therapeutic efficacy in monkey models can be reduplicated in HIV-infected individuals. Moreover, we are highly encouraged to develop a lipopeptide-based PrEP strategy and topical microbicides.
Our study has several limitations that need to be further explored. First, although we are very confident in LP-98 for its extremely potent in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo antiviral activities as well as the therapeutic and preventive efficacies, we cannot completely rule out the spontaneously controlled infection in SHIV SF162P3 -infected animals, which can be a confounding factor to PTC analysis; thus, a larger treatment cohort with an equivalent control group should be studied to confirm our findings. Second, the molecular mechanisms underlying PTC efficacy require comprehensive characterization, including the characteristics of superficial and deep viral reservoirs and potential immunological determinants. Third, it is somewhat surprising that none of the SHIV-infected animals in the established infection model developed any resistance, and they continued to be sensitive to LP-98 after prolonged re-administrations. Thus, further experiments should be performed to select and characterize HIV-1 mutants that are resistant to lipopeptides. Fourth, it is intriguing to know whether subcutaneously administrated LP-98 can diffuse into mucosal tissues, thus contributing to PrEP efficacy against intrarectal or intravaginal SHIV and SIV infections. Fifth, we hypothesize that, due to its differences from other classes of drugs that act after infection occurs, an efficient HIV-1 entry inhibitor that blocks the entry of a new round of infection of progeny viruses would effectively hamper the establishment of latent reservoirs; however, this concept demands proof.

Basic information for seventy-eight 3- to 5-year-old Chinese rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) used in this study is presented in Table S7 . All monkeys were confirmed negative for major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) Mamu-A ∗ 01, Mamu-A ∗ 02, MamuB ∗ 08, and Mamu-B ∗ 17 alleles associated with the control of SIV/SHIV replication and negative for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian type D retrovirus, simian T-lymphotropic virus, and herpes B virus infections. They were housed and cared for at the facility accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All animal experiments were conducted following the guideline approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Approval No. XJ17005, XJ18002, XJ18004, XJ19004, XJ19005, and XJ19007). All procedures involving animals were conducted under anesthesia with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) prior to sample collection, and appropriate steps were taken to minimize animal suffering.
SHIV SF162P3 , with the HIV-1 clade B env gene, was kindly provided by Drs. Janet Harouse, Cecilia Cheng-Mayer, and Ranajit Pal through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, NIH; SIVmac239 was a gift from Dr. Preston Marx. The two viral stocks were expanded with rhesus macaque PBMC (rmPBMCs). The Env sequences for SHIV SF162P3 and SIVmac239 were sequence-verified, and two challenge stocks were deposited into the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Virus titers were determined for rmPBMCs using a standard 50% tissue culture infection dose (TCID 50 ) assay. Intravenous ( I.V. ) infections were carried out with 100 TCID 50 of SHIV SF162P3 in 32 rhesus macaques (15 male and 17 female) or 1,000 TCID 50 of SHIV SF162P3 in nine rhesus macaques (3 male and 6 female). Intrarectal ( I.R. ) challenges were performed by placing virus inoculum atraumatically on the rectal mucosa of 10 male rhesus macaques (500 TCID 50 , SHIV SF162P3 ) or six female rhesus macaques (500 TCID 50 , SIVmac239). Intravaginal ( I.Vag. ) challenges were performed by placing virus inoculum atraumatically on the cervicovaginal mucosa of 10 female rhesus macaques (500 TCID 50 , SHIV SF162P3 ) or five female rhesus macaques (500 TCID 50 , SIVmac239). All mucosal inoculations (including intrarectal and intravaginal routes) were carried out for six weeks with 500 TCID 50 of SHIV SF162P3 or SIVmac239 twice-weekly until the virus was detectable in plasma, at which time, the challenges were terminated. Mucosal challenges were repeated up to twelve times, after which the uninfected monkeys were considered to be protected. The basic information for animals used in each model is presented in Table S7 .
Lipopeptides were produced according to previously described protocols ( Zhu et al., 2019 33. Zhu, Y. ∙ Chong, H. ∙ Yu, D. ... Design and characterization of cholesterylated peptide HIV-1/2 fusion inhibitors with extremely potent and long-lasting antiviral activity J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e02312-e02318 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peptides were synthesized on rink amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin using a standard solid-phase 9-flurorenylmethoxycarbonyl method. All peptides were acetylated at the N terminus prior to resin cleavage. Specifically, LP-97 was synthesized by chemoselective thioether conjugation between the peptide containing C-terminal cysteine residue and bromoacetic acid cholesterol; LP-98 and its scrambled version LP-98S were synthesized by amidation of a C-terminal lysine side chain with cholesteryl succinate monoester. The unsophisticated lipopeptides were purified using a Varian ProStar 218 high-performance liquid chromatography instrument with an Aglient Venusil MP C18 reversed phase column, followed by characterization with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight mass spectrometry on an ABI Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Briefly, 1–2 μL of ∼0.1 mg/mL peptide solution (methanol/ H 2 O/0.01% TFA, pre-mixed with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix) was transferred onto a stainless sample plate via micro pipette tips and then air-dried at room temperature. The mass spectrometer was operated in linear positive mode at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. A delay time of 900 ns was used prior to ion extraction, and mass spectra were acquired in the 1,500–6,000 m/z range. The purified lipopeptides had good solubility in distilled H 2 O or phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). The mass spec data are shown in Figure S7 .
CD spectroscopy was used to detect the secondary structure and thermostability of lipopeptides and T-20 or their complexes with NHR-derived target mimic peptides (N39 and N42), as described previously ( Zhu et al., 2019 33. Zhu, Y. ∙ Chong, H. ∙ Yu, D. ... Design and characterization of cholesterylated peptide HIV-1/2 fusion inhibitors with extremely potent and long-lasting antiviral activity J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e02312-e02318 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a lipopeptide was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2) with a final concentration of 10 μM and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco spectropolarimeter (model J-815) using a 1 nm bandwidth with a 1 nm step resolution from 195 nm to 270 nm at room temperature. The spectra were corrected by subtracting a solvent blank, and the α-helical content was calculated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity [θ] at 222 nm with a value of −33,000 deg cm 2 dmol −1 , corresponding to a 100% helix. Thermal denaturation was performed by monitoring the ellipticity change at 222 nm from 20°C to 98°C at a rate of 2°C /min, and the melting temperature ( T m ) was defined as the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition.
The inhibitory activity of a series of HIV-1 inhibitors on a panel of replication-competent HIV-1 or HIV-2, SIV, and SHIV isolates was determined following a previously described method ( Chong et al., 2019 9. Chong, H. ∙ Xue, J. ∙ Zhu, Y. ... Monotherapy with a low-dose lipopeptide HIV fusion inhibitor maintains long-term viral suppression in rhesus macaques PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1007552 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). To measure the inhibitory activity of five lipopeptides (LP-80, LP-83, LP-97, LP-98, and LP-98S) against infections of three HIV-1 (NL4-3, JRCSF, and 89.6), two HIV-2 (ROD and ST), two SIV (mac239 and mac251), and six SHIV (SF162P3, RT-SHIV, KU-1, KB9, CHN19P5, and 1157ipd3N4) isolates, viral stocks were prepared by transfecting viral molecular clones into HEK293T cells, and a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of viral stocks was measured in TZM-bl cells. An inhibitor was prepared in 3-fold dilutions, mixed with 100 TCID 50 of viruses and then incubated 1 h at room temperature. Then, 100 μL of the mixture was added to TZM-bl cells (10 4 /well in a 100 μL volume) and incubated for 48 h at 37°C. The cells were harvested and lysed in a reporter lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured using luciferase assay reagents and a luminescence counter (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). To measure the inhibitory activities of LP-80, LP-98, and three control inhibitors (T-20, AZT, and 3TC) against the infection of four molecular clones (NL4-3, 89.6, SG3.1, and LAI.2) and three clinically isolated HIV-1 strains (GX2016EU04, GX2016EU17, and GX2016EU19), a serially diluted inhibitor was mixed with 200 TCID 50 of viruses and added to 4 × 10 4 (TZM-bl, C8166, MT-4) or 4 × 10 5 (human PBMC) target cells, followed by incubation for 4 h at 37°C. Then, the virus–drug mixture was replaced with fresh culture medium and incubated for 4 days at 37°C. The P24 antigen in the culture supernatant was quantitated by an ELISA kit. The percent of inhibition and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) were calculated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times, and data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Inhibition of a large panel of HIV-1 pseudoviruses was determined in TZM-bl cells by a single-cycle infection assay following a previously described method ( Zhu et al., 2019 33. Zhu, Y. ∙ Chong, H. ∙ Yu, D. ... Design and characterization of cholesterylated peptide HIV-1/2 fusion inhibitors with extremely potent and long-lasting antiviral activity J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e02312-e02318 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate pseudoviruses, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with an Env-expressing plasmid and a backbone plasmid (pSG3Δenv) that encodes an Env-defective luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome. After 48 h, cell culture supernatants containing virus particles were harvested, filtrated, and stored at −80°C. To detect the inhibitory activity of peptides, pseudoviruses were mixed with an equal volume of a serially 3-fold diluted peptide and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The mixture was then added to TZM-bl cells at a density of 10 4 cells/100 μL per plate well. After incubation at 37°C for 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in reporter lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured. IC 50 values were calculated as the final cell culture concentration of an inhibitor that caused a 50% reduction in relative luminescence units compared with the level of the virus control subtracted from that of the cell control. To determine the impact of serum on the antiviral activity of LP-98, the lipopeptide was pre-incubated with 100% human or monkey sera that had been freshly isolated from healthy donors or incubated with 20% or 40% human serum albumin (HSA) at 37°C for 1 h. The assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times; data are expressed as the mean ± SD.
Inhibitory activity of inhibitors on HIV-1 Env-mediated cell–cell fusion was measured by a dual-split-protein (DSP)-based assay following a previously described method ( Zhu et al., 2019 33. Zhu, Y. ∙ Chong, H. ∙ Yu, D. ... Design and characterization of cholesterylated peptide HIV-1/2 fusion inhibitors with extremely potent and long-lasting antiviral activity J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e02312-e02318 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a total of 1.5 × 10 4 293T cells (effector cells) were plated in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37°C. The next day, 293T cells were co-transfected with an Env-expressing plasmid and a DSP 1-7 plasmid and incubated 24 h at 37°C. 293FT cells stably expressing CXCR4/CCR5 and DSP 8-11 (target cells) were resuspended, and EnduRen live cell substrate (Promega) was added, followed by incubation for 30 min at 37°C. Then, the target cells (3 × 10 4 /well) were cocultured with effector cells at 37°C in the presence or absence of a tested inhibitor at graded concentrations. The mixed cells were then spun down to maximize cell–cell contact and were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The luciferase activity was measured with luciferase assay reagents, and IC 50 values were calculated as described above. The assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times; data are expressed as the mean ± SD.
The cytotoxicities of lipopeptides and control inhibitors were determined for human PBMCs and five cell lines (MT-4, U937, C8166, TZM-bl, and HEK293T) using a CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell proliferation assay (Promega). In brief, a total of 1 × 10 4 cells were seeded on a 96-well tissue culture plate, and 50 μL of LP-80, LP-83, LP-97, LP-98, and three control inhibitors (T-20, AZT, and 3TC) diluted at graded concentrations were added to the cells. After incubation at 37°C for 2 days, 20 μL of CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Reagent was pipetted into each well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a SpectraMax M5 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA), and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated.
The pharmacokinetic study with Sprague-Dawley rats were conducted at Beijing JOINN Laboratories and approved by IACUC (ACU21-1755). In brief, eighteen rats aged 6-8 weeks were intravenously administrated LP-98 at 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg (n = 6). Serial blood samples were collected from jugular vein of each animal before injection (0 h) and at 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 120, and 168 h postinjection. The blood was transferred into cooled centrifuge tubes and then centrifuged (3,000 g) for 10 min at 4°C. Plasma concentration of LP-98 was analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method. T max (time of maximum concentration), C max (the peak or maximum concentration), t 1/2 (terminal half-time), AUC (area under concentration-time curve), Vd (apparent volume of distribution), Cl (clearance), MRT (mean residence time), and any other appropriate parameters were calculated using WinNonlin software (v8.0) by non-compartmental analysis.
Ex vivo anti-HIV activities of LP-97 and LP-98 were determined in a non-human primate model following a previously described method ( Zhu et al., 2019 33. Zhu, Y. ∙ Chong, H. ∙ Yu, D. ... Design and characterization of cholesterylated peptide HIV-1/2 fusion inhibitors with extremely potent and long-lasting antiviral activity J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e02312-e02318 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, an inhibitor (3 mg/kg of body weight) was subcutaneously administered to six rhesus macaques that had been used to evaluate the anti-HIV activities of T-20, LP-19, LP-50, LP-51, LP-80, and LP-83. Similarly, serum samples of macaques were harvested before injection (0 h) and after injection (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h), and their inhibitory activities on HIV-1 NL4-3 were measured by a single-cycle infection assay. The 50% effective concentration was defined as the fold serum dilution that inhibited 50% of the virus infection.
Twenty-one young adult male and female rhesus macaques were included in the study. Three SHIV SF162P3 -infected monkeys (labeled as K1, K4, and K5) were the part of a completed LP-80 treatment experiment. Seven monkeys (labeled as HB1 to HB7) with chronic SHIV SF162P3 infection were the infected model control of a recently completed study. Eleven monkeys were infected intravenously with SHIV SF162P3 challenge stock at 100 TCID 50 dose (labeled as HA1 to HA5) or 1,000 TCID 50 dose (labeled as HC1 to HC6). When chronic SHIV infection or SVR had been established, the animals were subcutaneously or intramuscularly treated with single- or multiple-round LP-98 (dissolved in distilled H 2 O). The treatment regimens are described in Table S6 . Animals with potential PTC efficacy maintained viral loads below the limit of detection (100 copies/mL) for multiple time points after LP-98 treatment interruption, at which point the animals were followed up to necropsy or complete CD8 depletion. Animals with a viral rebound after treatment cessation were treated with LP-98 before they were euthanized so that their viral RNA was suppressed. Peripheral blood, LN, and other tissue sample collections were performed and processed.
Twenty-one monkeys exhibited distinct outcomes and were divided into three groups based on the control of viral rebound: 1) stable virologic control group (SVC, 5 monkeys), which was defined as having consecutive plasma viral loads below the limit of detection for more than 8 months after treatment interruption; 2) unstable virologic rebound group (UVR, 7 monkeys), which was characterized by a virologic rebound that occasionally dropped below the limit of detection after treatment cessation; 3) stable virologic rebound group (SVR, 9 monkeys), which was defined as the stable establishment of virologic rebound by consecutive detection of viral RNA levels after treatment discontinuation.
Fifty-one rhesus macaques, each weighing 4–6 kg, were used to evaluate the PrEP efficacy of subcutaneously injected LP-98 (dissolved in PBS; pH7.2) with a single intravenously SHIV SF162P3 -infected macaque model and a repeat-exposure SHIV SF162P3 /SIVmac239 macaque model of rectal or vaginal transmission. For protection of SHIV intravenous infection, fifteen monkeys received 5 mg/kg LP-98 at 2 hours (PrEP-2h group), 1 week (PrEP-1w group), and 2 weeks (PrEP-2w group) before intravenous exposure of 100 TCID 50 to SHIV SF162P3 , while five monkeys were pre-administrated with solvent (PBS) as a control group. For protection of mucosal infection, LP-98 was administrated once-weekly, and the monkeys were challenged twice-weekly with 500 TCID 50 of SHIV SF162P3 or 500 TCID 50 of SIVmac239 through an intrarectal ( I.R. ) or intravaginal route ( I.Vag ). LP-98 administration was performed 2 hours before the virus challenge. Virus exposures were stopped when a macaque became SHIV or SIV RNA-positive. For protection of SHIV I.R. or I.Vag infection, twenty monkeys were divided into four groups (n = 5/group), including an LP-98 I.R. group (5 mg/kg) and a control I.R. group (equal volume placebo) as well as an LP-98 I.Vag. group (5 mg/kg) and a control I.Vag. group (equal volume placebo). For protection of SIVmac239 I.Vag infection, five monkeys were divided into two groups, including an LP-98 group (10 mg/kg, n = 3) and a control group (equal volume PBS, n = 2). For protection of SIVmac239 I.R. infection, six macaques received 10 mg/kg LP-98 administration and were subsequently repeat-challenged intrarectally with SIVmac239. After a 5-month observation, three macaques were rechallenged with an identical rectal repeat-exposure of 500 TCID 50 to SIVmac239, and the remaining three monkeys were used as the non-rechallenge control group for continuous monitoring. Peripheral blood and other tissue sample collections were performed and processed.
For whole-blood cell counts, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated whole blood were stained with the following monoclonal antibodies: CD3-PE/Cy7 (SP34-2), CD4-Percp/Cy5.5 (L200), and CD8-APC/Cy7 (RPA-T8). CD4 + T cell counts were determined with BD Trucount tubes according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). LN biopsies were performed and then treated with 5 mM EDTA and 60 U/mL collagenase. LN mononuclear cells were enriched for lymphocytes using Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using conventional Ficoll–Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Polychromatic flow cytometry was performed on PBMCs and collected tissues using anti-human antibodies that are cross-reactive with rhesus macaques. For seven parameters, the following antibodies were used: anti-CD3-BV786 (SP34-2, BD), anti-CD4-FITC (OKT4, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45RA-APC (5H9, BD), anti-CCR7-BV605 (G043H7, BioLegend), anti-CXCR5-PE-Cy7 (MU5UBEE, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-PD-1-BV711 (EH12.2H7, Biolegend), and anti-ICOS-BV510 (C398.4A, BioLegend). For eleven parameters, the following antibodies were used: anti-CD45-PerCP (D058-1283, BD), anti-CD3–BV786 (SP34-2, BD), anti-CD4–FITC (OKT4, BioLegend), anti-CD25–APC/Cy7 (BC96, BioLegend), anti-CD69–BV421 (FN50, BioLegend), anti-HLA-DR–BV605 (L243, BioLegend), anti-CD45RA-APC (5H9, BD), anti-CCR7-BV650 (G043H7, BioLegend), anti-CD32–PE (FLI8.26, BD), anti-PD-1-BV711 (EH12.2H7, BioLegend), and anti-TIGIT-PE-Cy7 (MBSA43, eBioscience). Flow cytometric acquisition was performed on a BD FACSAria II flow cytometer, and data analysis was performed using FlowJo v10 software.
Anti-drug antibody responses in the LP-98-treated monkeys were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, a 96-well microplate was coated with LP-98, LP-98S, P-98, or SIV-P27 at 100 ng/well at 4°C overnight. The plates were blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at 37°C and then washed with PBS. A plasma sample tested at a 1:100 dilution was added into the wells and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). HRP Monoclonal Anti-Monkey IgG (ProSci, Inc., Poway, CA, USA) was then added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was visualized with the addition of 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and was stopped with the addition of 2 M H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and were recovered in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% penicillin/streptomycin overnight at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . The cells were then resuspended to 1 × 10 6 cells/mL and stimulated with an SIV-Gag peptide pool at a final concentration of 2 μg/mL (NIH-ARP). The negative and positive controls (Cell Stimulation Cocktail plus protein transport inhibitors, eBioscience) were included. Brefeldin A (at a final concentration of 1 × ; BioLegend) and anti-CD107a-BV786 (BD Biosciences) were added to all experimental wells. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37°C. Following stimulation, cells were washed with PBS and labeled with the Zombie NIR Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend) at room temperature for 20 min to identify live cells. Then, cells were washed with PBS containing1% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide and stained with anti-CD3-BV605 (SP34-2, BD Biosciences) and anti-CD8-FITC (RPAT8, BD Biosciences) at 4°C for 30 min, and fixed/permeabilized with Fixation and Permeabilization Solution (BD Biosciences) at 4°C for 20 min. After fixation, cells were washed by Perm/Wash Buffer (BD Biosciences) and stained with anti-IFN-γ-BV711 (4S.B3, BioLegend), anti-MIP-1β-BV421 (D21-1351, BD Biosciences), anti-IL-2-PE-Cy7 (MQ1-17H12, BioLegend), or anti-TNF-α-BV650 (MAb11, BioLegend) at 4°C for 30 min. Finally, cells were washed by Perm/Wash Buffer and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on BD FACSAria II.
Plasma samples from each animal were collected for the measurement of anti-SIV antibody by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Briefly, plasma samples collected from the monkeys were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Serially two-fold diluted plasma were added to each well on special slides coated with SIVmac239-infected CEM-174 cells and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Then, the slides were washed with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-monkey IgG at 1:64 dilution (F3893, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37°C. The slides were sealed with 50% glycerin and fluorescence was observed with an inverted fluorescent microscope.
Six monkeys (labeled as HB3, HB4, HC1, HC3, HC5, and HC6) were subcutaneously injected with 10 mg/kg of anti-monkey CD8 antibody MT807R1 (Non-human Primate Reagent Resource, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and then intravenously treated with 5 mg/kg MT807R1 antibody on days 3 and 7 after the initial anti-CD8 antibody infusion, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. CD8 + T cell counts and viral loads were monitored weekly following anti-CD8 antibody infusion.
CD8 + T cells were sorted by MACS® negative selection (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and preserved by TRIzol (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, USA) for RNA-Seq analysis, which was conducted at OE biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Total RNA was extracted using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). RNA integrity was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples with an RNA Integrity Number ≥ 7 were subjected to subsequent analysis. The TruSeq Stranded mRNA LTSample PrEP Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to establish cDNA libraries, which were sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform (Illumina HiSeq X Ten) and 125 bp/150 bp paired-end reads were generated.
Plasma viral RNA and total DNA of PBMCs or tissues were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay following a previously described method ( Chong et al., 2019 9. Chong, H. ∙ Xue, J. ∙ Zhu, Y. ... Monotherapy with a low-dose lipopeptide HIV fusion inhibitor maintains long-term viral suppression in rhesus macaques PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1007552 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Viral RNA was extracted and purified from cell-free plasma using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Viral DNA was extracted and purified from DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). qRT–PCR was carried out on an ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the following cycling protocol and primers: 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min. The sequences of primers and probe were targeted against the conserved region SIVmac239 as follows: 5′- GCAGAGGAGGAAATTACCCAGTAC-3′(forward), 5′- CAATTTTACCCAGGCATTTAATGTT-3′(reverse), and 5′-(FAM)-ACCTGCCATTAAGCCCGA-(MGB)-3′(probe). The detection limit for viral RNA in plasma was 100 copies/mL and for viral DNA in tissues was 10 copies/μg of total DNA.
Quantification of replication-competent virus in resting CD4 + T cells was performed by a quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) following a previously described method ( Dinoso et al., 2009 12. Dinoso, J.B. ∙ Rabi, S.A. ∙ Blankson, J.N. ... A simian immunodeficiency virus-infected macaque model to study viral reservoirs that persist during highly active antiretroviral therapy J. Virol. 2009; 83 :9247-9257 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Finzi et al., 1999 16. Finzi, D. ∙ Blankson, J. ∙ Siliciano, J.D. ... Latent infection of CD4+ T cells provides a mechanism for lifelong persistence of HIV-1, even in patients on effective combination therapy Nat. Med. 1999; 5 :512-517 Crossref Scopus (1849) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, resting CD4 + T cells in PBMCs and LNs from individual LP-98-suppressed SHIV SF162P3 –infected monkeys were purified by two-step magnetic bead depletion (CD4 + T cell Isolation Kit and CD69 Antibody, CD25 MicroBeads, HLA-DR MicroBeads; both from Miltenyi Biotec). Resting CD4 + T cells were serially diluted (5-fold) and stimulated with T Cell Activation/Expansion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) in X-VIVO 15 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as well as 100 U/mL IL-2 (PEPROTECH). To propagate a replication-competent virus, 1 × 10 5 of activated PBMCs from uninfected donors, which were processed using the T Cell Activation/Expansion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec), were added to the media. Supernatants from each well were then assessed for viral RNA by qPCR to determine the presence of a replication competent virus at 7, 14, and 21 days after stimulation. The frequency of latently infected cells among the input resting CD4 + T cells was calculated using an online infectious unit per million cells (IUPM) Stats v1.0 Infection Frequency Calculator using the maximum likelihood (ML) method, which was expressed as IUPM CD4 + T cells ( Rosenbloom et al., 2015 27. Rosenbloom, D.I. ∙ Elliott, O. ∙ Hill, A.L. ... Designing and interpreting limiting dilution assays: general principles and applications to the latent reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus-1 Open Forum Infect. Dis. 2015; 2 :ofv123 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the ML method, samples without a replication-competent virus were assessed by analyses as the limit of detection of the assay based on cell input. The detection limit for QVOA was 0.56 IUPM.
Adapters and low-quality reads in the raw data reads were removed using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 3. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (38307) PubMed Google Scholar ). The clean reads were then aligned to the RheMac10 genome by Hisat2 ( Kim et al., 2015 20. Kim, D. ∙ Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. HISAT: a fast spliced aligner with low memory requirements Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :357-360 Crossref Scopus (13753) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unique mapped reads of each gene were counted by htseq-count (HTSeq) ( Anders et al., 2015 1. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq--a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (13500) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the generated count matrices, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between one group and all other samples were identified by DESeq2 package ( Love et al., 2014 23. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes with a p value < 0.05 and an absolute fold change > 2 were considered as DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis for DEGs in a group was carried out using Metascape ( Zhou et al., 2019 31. Zhou, Y. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Pache, L. ... Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1523 Crossref Scopus (7462) PubMed Google Scholar ). Terms with a P value < 0.01 and a hit rate > 0.05 were considered significantly enriched.
Comparisons between the two groups were determined using two-tailed unpaired Mann–Whitney test. Comparisons among the three groups were determined using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s t test for multiple comparisons or Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. Kaplan–Meier analysis was determined using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9.0.2 software. Significance was set at ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗ p < 0.001.
