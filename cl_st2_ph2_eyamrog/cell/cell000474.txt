Title: ERα is an RNA-binding protein sustaining tumor cell survival and drug resistance


Abstract: Summary

Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a hormone receptor and key driver for over 70% of breast cancers that has been studied for decades as a transcription factor. Unexpectedly, we discover that ERα is a potent non-canonical RNA-binding protein. We show that ERα RNA binding function is uncoupled from its activity to bind DNA and critical for breast cancer progression. Employing genome-wide cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) sequencing and a functional CRISPRi screen, we find that ERα-associated mRNAs sustain cancer cell fitness and elicit cellular responses to stress. Mechanistically, ERα controls different steps of RNA metabolism. In particular, we demonstrate that ERα RNA binding mediates alternative splicing of XBP1 and translation of the eIF4G2 and MCL1 mRNAs, which facilitates survival upon stress conditions and sustains tamoxifen resistance of cancer cells. ERα is therefore a multifaceted RNA-binding protein, and this activity transforms our knowledge of post-transcriptional regulation underlying cancer development and drug response.

Section: Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, with over 70% of breast cancers harboring activation of the nuclear hormone receptor estrogen receptor α (ERα) ( Ali and Coombes, 2002 2. Ali, S. ∙ Coombes, R.C. Endocrine-responsive breast cancer and strategies for combating resistance Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2 :101-112 Crossref Scopus (735) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the past few decades, a comprehensive picture of ERα function, predominantly at the level of transcriptional regulation in the nucleus, and its contribution to breast cancer progression has emerged. Inhibition of ERα with tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, is typically employed as a first-line therapy to block the activity of ERα in transcriptional regulation and prolongs survival ( Howell et al., 2004 36. Howell, S.J. ∙ Johnston, S.R. ∙ Howell, A. The use of selective estrogen receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor down-regulators in breast cancer Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 18 :47-66 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shiau et al., 1998 77. Shiau, A.K. ∙ Barstad, D. ∙ Loria, P.M. ... The structural basis of estrogen receptor/coactivator recognition and the antagonism of this interaction by tamoxifen Cell. 1998; 95 :927-937 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2356) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a notable portion of affected individuals eventually develops relapsed disease and becomes insensitive to this antagonist ( Metcalfe et al., 2018 60. Metcalfe, C. ∙ Friedman, L.S. ∙ Hager, J.H. Hormone-Targeted Therapy and Resistance Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2018; 2 :291-312 Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar ). In most cases of tamoxifen-resistant tumors, ERα remains active ( Jeselsohn et al., 2015 38. Jeselsohn, R. ∙ Buchwalter, G. ∙ De Angelis, C. ... ESR1 mutations—a mechanism for acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2015; 12 :573-583 Crossref Scopus (435) PubMed Google Scholar ; Katzenellenbogen et al., 2018 41.

Cancer. 2018; 18 :377-388 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). ERα is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, rapidly translocating between the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Lombardi et al., 2008 53. Lombardi, M. ∙ Castoria, G. ∙ Migliaccio, A. ... Hormone-dependent nuclear export of estradiol receptor and DNA synthesis in breast cancer cells J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182 :327-340 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we made the striking discovery that ERα is a non-canonical RNA-binding protein (RBP) with a previously unknown function as a regulator of RNA metabolism.
Recent discoveries of non-canonical RBPs have expanded the RNA-binding repertoire to a broader category of proteins ( Castello et al., 2012 10. Castello, A. ∙ Fischer, B. ∙ Eichelbaum, K. ... Insights into RNA biology from an atlas of mammalian mRNA-binding proteins Cell. 2012; 149 :1393-1406 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1570) PubMed Google Scholar ; Trendel et al., 2019 85.

The Human RNA-Binding Proteome and Its Dynamics during Translational Arrest Cell. 2019; 176 :391-403.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). Their ability to bind RNA may support their original roles or provide different functions, such as in controlling post-transcriptional regulations. For example, the master transcription co-activator CREB binding protein (CBP) binds to a variety of enhancer RNAs that increase its histone acetylation activity and transcription control ( Bose et al., 2017 7. Bose, D.A. ∙ Donahue, G. ∙ Reinberg, D. ... RNA Binding to CBP Stimulates Histone Acetylation and Transcription Cell. 2017; 168 :135-149.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cyclin A2, a core cell cycle regulator, is also an RBP that plays a role in RNA metabolism by binding and modulating the translation of the meiotic recombination 11 (Mre11) mRNA, which leads to a kinase-independent, RNA-binding-dependent role in repairing replication errors ( Kanakkanthara et al., 2016 40. Kanakkanthara, A. ∙ Jeganathan, K.B. ∙ Limzerwala, J.F. ... Cyclin A2 is an RNA binding protein that controls Mre11 mRNA translation Science. 2016; 353 :1549-1552 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). All of these examples highlight the pleiotropic potential of key proteins in controlling distinct biological processes. Interestingly, a study in the 1990s reported that nuclear receptors, including ERα, are colocalized and physically interact with a non-coding RNA, which enhances the transcriptional potency of the nuclear receptors ( Lanz et al., 1999 45. Lanz, R.B. ∙ McKenna, N.J. ∙ Onate, S.A. ... A steroid receptor coactivator, SRA, functions as an RNA and is present in an SRC-1 complex Cell. 1999; 97 :17-27 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (696) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, decades of research on ERα have remained predominantly focused on its activity in binding DNA.
In this study, we surprisingly found that ERα is a non-canonical RBP and that abolishing ERα RNA-binding activity does not affect its classical DNA-binding ability but causes growth defects of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . Employing unbiased, genome-wide, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) and functional genomic CRISPRi screens, we pinpointed unique networks of mRNAs crucial for cancer progression that are bound by ERα in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR), including those involved in the cellular response to stress during tumor development. Two well-characterized adaptive responses, the integrated stress response (ISR) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) ( Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020 17. Costa-Mattioli, M. ∙ Walter, P.

USA. 2004; 101 :11269-11274 Crossref Scopus (1278) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we demonstrate that ERα controls the alternative splicing of XBP1 mRNA, a key component of the UPR pathway, and regulates the translation of stress response proteins such as eIF4G2 and MCL1 mRNAs. The ability of ERα to modulate these genes at the post-transcriptional level promotes cancer cell survival and sustains tamoxifen resistance. Therefore, our study shows that ERα is a multifaceted RBP that transforms our knowledge of post-transcriptional regulation underlying tumor cell survival and drug response.

Metab. 2005; 16 :347-353 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ), we first performed ERα immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis to identify a possible ERα protein interactome in the cytoplasmic fraction of ERα+ MCF7 breast cancer cells. Intriguingly, the most enriched protein category that interacts with ERα is proteins that bind RNA ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ). These include key translation factors (e.g., eIF3C, eIF4E2, eIF4A1, and eEF1A1), a set of ribosomal proteins, proteins involved in mRNA translation regulation (e.g., LARP1 and YBX1), proteins involved in RNA splicing (e.g., RtcB), as well as those mediating RNA stability controls (e.g., ELAVL1, FMR1, and G3BP1/2).
To investigate whether ERα functions as an RBP, we employed oligo(dT) beads to pull down poly(A) mRNAs and assessed the fraction of ERα bound to these mRNAs. These experiments show that a notable proportion of the cytoplasmic and soluble nuclear ERα is bound to poly(A) RNAs in MCF7 and T47D ERα+ breast cancer cell lines ( Figure 1 A). ERα association with RNA is also evident in human breast tumor samples and is significantly higher than that in normal adjacent tissue ( Figure S1 B). This is in contrast to other nuclear receptor superfamily members, including progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), that are not tightly associated with poly(A) RNA in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Interestingly, however, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) possesses an RNA-binding potential ( Figure S1 C), which is in agreement with a previous report showing that the GR is associated with some mRNAs (e.g., cytokines CCL2 and CCL7) ( Ishmael et al., 2011 37. Ishmael, F.T. ∙ Fang, X. ∙ Houser, K.R. ...

Immunol. 2011; 186 :1189-1198 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further investigate whether ERα directly binds RNA, we used ultraviolet radiation cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP; Licatalosi et al., 2008 50. Licatalosi, D.D. ∙ Mele, A. ∙ Fak, J.J. ... HITS-CLIP yields genome-wide insights into brain alternative RNA processing Nature. 2008; 456 :464-469 Crossref Scopus (1074) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Darnell, 2011 96. Zhang, C. ∙ Darnell, R.B. Mapping in vivo protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution from HITS-CLIP data Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :607-614 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that cross-linked ERα-RNA complexes migrated in a less defined band, reflecting cross-linkage with heterogeneous RNAs, which became defined at the size of the ERα protein upon high-concentration RNase treatment ( Figure 1 B). This result demonstrates that ERα is capable of binding RNA directly. To investigate the RNA targets of ERα across the genome, we next sequenced ERα CLIP libraries using HITS-CLIP ( Figure S1 D). ERα binds exonic and intronic sites on RNAs, and within the transcript, ERα preferentially binds at 3′ UTRs ( Figure 1 C; Figures S1 E and S1F; Table S2 ). ERα-bound mRNAs are enriched for common Gene Ontology terms crucial for cancer progression, including cell-cell adhesion, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as negative regulation of apoptotic processes ( Figure S1 G). Intriguingly, we identified a sequence motif that is enriched in ERα CLIP peaks over the background ( Figure 1 D), which is primarily detected in the 3′ UTRs of mRNAs. Importantly, this motif sequence is observed in many ERα-bound mRNAs and is conserved among mammals ( Figure S1 H). We also find that ERα RNA-binding sites are highly conserved compared with the immediately surrounding regions ( Figure 1 E), which is comparable to that of HuR, a classical RBP that binds the 3′ UTR of mRNAs ( Figure S1 I). Therefore, the evolutionary conservation of the ERα RNA-binding site suggests a putative role in RNA regulation.
We further confirmed that ERα is an RBP by visualizing the direct interaction of ERα with RNA in vitro . We selected one of the top ERα-bound mRNAs, XBP1 ( Figure S1 E), and monitored the thermal stability of purified ERα protein with or without this mRNA ( Figure 1 F). We observed that the melting temperature of ERα protein increased dramatically in a dose-dependent manner when incubated together with the XBP1 mRNA ( Figure 1 F), demonstrating that there is a direct association of ERα with this mRNA. These data not only confirm that ERα binds RNA directly but also suggest that ERα may bind to specific mRNAs important for cancer development.
We next tested which domain of ERα is responsible for the association with mRNA. We first utilized RNABindRPlus ( Terribilini et al., 2007 84. Terribilini, M. ∙ Sander, J.D. ∙ Lee, J.H. ... RNABindR: a server for analyzing and predicting RNA-binding sites in proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :W578-84 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) to predict the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of ERα. Intriguingly, one of the key predicted RBDs is located between amino acids 255–272 within the hinge domain of ERα after its DNA-binding domain (DBD) ( Figure 2 A). We determined that only the ERα construct containing the predicted RBD is directly associated with RNAs in vitro ( Figure S2 A). Moreover, this association is completely abolished when the predicted RBD is removed ( Figure 2 B), demonstrating that ERα interacts with RNA directly through this putative RBD.
We created an RBD mutant of ERα by minimalizing the mutation to amino acids 259–262 (RRGG > AAAA) and generated stable ERα RNA-binding-deficient MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines by replacing the endogenous ERα with FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) and RBD-mutated (RBDmut) ERα ( Figure S2 B). In MCF7 and T47D cells, ERα RBDmut loses its RNA-binding ability ( Figure 2 C). Because WT and RBDmut ERα are able to localize to the nucleus ( Figure S2 C), we next wanted to find out whether the ERα RBD mutant may have an effect on the DNA-binding function of ERα. To test this, we first extracted the chromatin-bound fractions of MCF7 cell lysates and confirmed that in WT and RBDmut cell lines, ERα retains its DNA-binding ability ( Figure S2 D). We further performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), using a FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate WT and RBDmut ERα and their associated DNAs. ERα RBDmut possesses similar DNA-binding ability as the WT, with a strong Pearson correlation of chromatin binding ( r = 0.97; Figure 2 D) and similar peak intensities surrounding the ERα binding events ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Figure S2 E). A volcano plot also shows very few differences in the DNA-binding events ( Figure S2 F), most of which are not located at annotated promoters or enhancers ( Table S3 ) and are therefore unlikely to affect gene expression. As expected, the estrogen response element (ERE) is similarly enriched most significantly ( Figure S2 G). We further validated the ChIP-seq by ChIP-qPCR of two classical ERα transcriptional targets, GREB1 and TFF1 . Our data confirmed that WT or RBDmut ERα binds identically to the promoters of these genes ( Figure S2 H).
Interestingly, of a total of 1,193 mRNAs bound by ERα (including 3′ UTR-, 5′ UTR-, and coding sequence [CDS]-bound mRNAs), 107 overlapped with those ERα-bound on chromatin, including known estrogen-regulated genes such as TFF1 and GREB1 ( Figure S2 I). This suggests that ERα may interact simultaneously with this subset of mRNAs as a transcription factor and as an RBP. However, the majority of mRNAs bound by ERα are not ERα-bound genes on the chromatin ( Figure S2 I). These results indicate that ERα RNA-binding activity may regulate a different group of genes at the post-transcriptional level, independent of its classical function as a transcription factor.
We next investigated whether ERα RNA binding is essential for cancer cell growth. Mutating the RBD of ERα in MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells significantly impaired proliferation of ERα RBDmut breast cancer cells ( Figure 2 G). We extended our study in vivo by employing xenograft mouse models. Abrogating the RNA-binding ability of ERα also suppressed tumor growth in vivo ( Figure 2 H). These data demonstrate that the RNA-binding activity of ERα contributes to breast cancer progression.
To understand how ERα-RNA association contributes to breast cancer progression at the molecular level, we employed a CRISPRi screen approach ( Gilbert et al., 2014 26. Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Adamson, B. ... Genome-Scale CRISPR-Mediated Control of Gene Repression and Activation Cell. 2014; 159 :647-661 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1881) PubMed Google Scholar ; Horlbeck et al., 2016 35. Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ... Compact and highly active next-generation libraries for CRISPR-mediated gene repression and activation eLife. 2016; 5 :e19760 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a customized library to target genes whose mRNAs were bound by ERα at their 3′ UTRs. The single guide RNA (sgRNA) library constructs ( Table S4 ) were transfected into MCF7 cells stably expressing the doxycycline-inducible inactive form of the Cas9 protein (dCas9), and the sgRNAs frequencies representing the growth phenotype were determined ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Figure S3 A). With a cutoff of (|log 10 (p value) × average growth phenotype| > 1), this screen identified several transcripts important for the fitness of breast cancer cells and also narrowed down the list of ERα-bound transcripts to a set of functional gene networks (containing 237 genes) whose silencing significantly inhibits cell growth ( Figure 3 B; Table S5 ). We performed Gene Ontology analyses on the 237 transcripts essential for breast cancer growth. This revealed several significantly enriched biological function categories (p < 0.01) that were grouped into major functional clusters ( Figure 3 C) associated with known key cellular hallmarks underlying breast cancer, including cell cycle, response to estradiol stimulus, protein synthesis, and cell motility. Notably enriched was a group of mRNAs involved in the adaptive response to stress ( Figure 3 C), a cellular process that is emerging as a key hallmark of tumor development and therapy response. This is notable as cancer cells are exposed to stressful environments in vivo , such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and oxidative stressors during tumor growth and metastasis formation.
Therefore, to understand how ERα as an RBP provides a survival advantage to cancer cells, we functionally investigated transcripts from our CRISPRi screen: the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 2 (eIF4G2), and transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1), all of which are implicated in the cellular response to stress. MCL1 belongs to the BCL-2 anti-apoptotic protein family, which prevents cancer cell death ( Cory et al., 2016 16. Cory, S. ∙ Roberts, A.W. ∙ Colman, P.M. ... Targeting BCL-2-like Proteins to Kill Cancer Cells Trends Cancer. 2016; 2 :443-460 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). eIF4G2 (also called DAP5, p97, and NAT1), is homologous to eIF4G1, a translation initiation factor. eIF4G2 is involved in translation of mRNAs crucial for cell growth and invasion ( Liberman et al., 2015 49.

The translation initiation factor DAP5 promotes IRES-driven translation of p53 mRNA Oncogene. 2014; 33 :611-618 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) in a cap-independent manner upon stress ( de la Parra et al., 2018 19. de la Parra, C. ∙ Ernlund, A. ∙ Alard, A. ... A widespread alternate form of cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3068 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). XBP1 is a key transcription factor downstream of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-mediated UPR whose mRNA is processed unconventionally to generate a spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s) ( Walter and Ron, 2011 89. Walter, P. ∙ Ron, D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation Science. 2011; 334 :1081-1086 Crossref Scopus (4458) PubMed Google Scholar ) that has enhanced transcriptional activity. This activation of XBP1 promotes cell survival upon stress and, thus, is oncogenic in many cancer types, including breast cancer ( Chen et al., 2014 13. Chen, X. ∙ Iliopoulos, D. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... XBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1α pathway Nature. 2014; 508 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gomez et al., 2007 27.

Human X-box binding protein-1 confers both estrogen independence and antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cell lines FASEB J. 2007; 21 :4013-4027 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CRISPRi screen revealed that silencing these genes resulted in noticeable cell growth inhibition as early as 5 days of dCas9 induction, which became more pronounced at later time points ( Figure S3 B). To validate their phenotype in regulating cell fitness, we performed a competition growth assay to determine the growth advantage/disadvantage of each gene. Consistent with the CRISPRi screen result, depletion of MCL1, eIF4G2, or XBP1 caused a significant growth defect ( Figure 3 D), suggesting that these mRNAs bound by ERα are essential for breast cancer fitness.
ERα binding to selective ISR and UPR transcripts is suggestive of a previously unknown post-transcriptional program. How specific components of these stress response pathways, such as XBP1, are regulated in cancer cells remain poorly understood. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with ERα and the 3′ UTR of XBP1 mRNA, we observed a significant association of the XBP1 3′ UTR with ERα ( Figure 4 A; Figure S4 A). Functionally, blocking the RNA-binding activity of ERα almost completely repressed alternative splicing of XBP1 mRNA upon endoplasmic reticulum stress in MCF7 cells ( Figure 4 B). A similar defect in XBP1 splicing was also observed in T47D cells with the ERα RBDmut ( Figure S4 B). Cleavage of XBP1 mRNA results in a shorter transcript but also shifts its open reading frame (ORF), resulting in production of a larger but more potent transcription factor, XBP1s ( Calfon et al., 2002 9. Calfon, M. ∙ Zeng, H. ∙ Urano, F. ... IRE1 couples endoplasmic reticulum load to secretory capacity by processing the XBP-1 mRNA Nature. 2002; 415 :92-96 Crossref Scopus (2283) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yoshida et al., 2001 94.

In this respect, the difference in splicing of XBP1 mRNA between cells with WT or RBDmut ERα is also evident at the protein level ( Figure 4 C).
Upon endoplasmic reticulum stress, UPR signaling and particularly the IRE1 endonuclease are activated and mediate cleavage of XBP1 mRNA ( Yoshida et al., 2001 94. Yoshida, H. ∙ Matsui, T. ∙ Yamamoto, A. ...

Cell. 2014; 55 :758-770 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 D). Interestingly, ERα interacts physically with RtcB ( Figure 4 E), likely through its ligand binding domain (LBD) ( Figure S4 C). The ERα-bound regions on XBP1 mRNA are very close to where RtcB binds ( Figure 4 F). Interestingly, abrogating ERα RNA-binding activity or silencing RtcB resulted in notable defects in XBP1 splicing upon stress; the ERα RBD mutation together with RtcB silencing, however, did not further suppress XBP1 splicing ( Figure 4 G), suggesting that ERα controls XBP1 alternative splicing through RtcB.
Studies show that approximately 20% of individuals who are ERα+ and received endocrine therapies gain hotspot mutations in the ERα LBD ( Jeselsohn et al., 2015 38. Jeselsohn, R. ∙ Buchwalter, G. ∙ De Angelis, C. ... ESR1 mutations—a mechanism for acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2015; 12 :573-583 Crossref Scopus (435) PubMed Google Scholar ) that account for acquired endocrine resistance. We observed a dramatic increase in the physical interaction of RtcB with ERα harboring these clinically relevant mutations (particularly L536H) compared with WT ERα ( Figure 4 H), revealing that the gain-of-function mutants of ERα might also possess a previously unknown function, such as facilitating XBP1 splicing through RtcB. This further supports the theory that the post-transcriptional role of ERα may be clinically relevant for the endocrine therapy response in human breast cancer.
To extend the functional significance of the XBP1 splicing pathway ( Figure 4 D) in breast cancer, we employed a pharmacological approach by inhibiting cleavage of XBP1 mRNA through an IRE1 inhibitor, STF-083010, which specifically blocks its endonuclease but not kinase activity ( Papandreou et al., 2011 66. Papandreou, I. ∙ Denko, N.C. ∙ Olson, M. ... Identification of an Ire1alpha endonuclease specific inhibitor with cytotoxic activity against human multiple myeloma Blood. 2011; 117 :1311-1314 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inhibiting the activity of IRE1 dramatically inhibited ERα+ MCF7 cancer cell growth ( Figure 4 I). Furthermore, we monitored tumor growth in the mammary environment of non-obese diabetic (NOD) scid gamma (NSG) mice with or without STF-083010. Dosing the mice with STF-083010 notably blocked tumor formation ( Figure 4 J), suggesting that targeting this pathway can be beneficial for treating breast cancer. Previous reports have suggested that overexpression of XBP1s in ERα+ breast cancer cells may lead to estrogen-independent growth and reduced sensitivity to anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen ( Gomez et al., 2007 27. Gomez, B.P. ∙ Riggins, R.B. ∙ Shajahan, A.N. ... Human X-box binding protein-1 confers both estrogen independence and antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cell lines FASEB J. 2007; 21 :4013-4027 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ming et al., 2015 62. Ming, J. ∙ Ruan, S. ∙ Wang, M. ... A novel chemical, STF-083010, reverses tamoxifen-related drug resistance in breast cancer by inhibiting IRE1/XBP1 Oncotarget. 2015; 6 :40692-40703 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), which predicts poorer survival of individuals with ERα+ breast cancer receiving endocrine therapies ( Davies et al., 2008 18. Davies, M.P. ∙ Barraclough, D.L. ∙ Stewart, C. ... Expression and splicing of the unfolded protein response gene XBP-1 are significantly associated with clinical outcome of endocrine-treated breast cancer Int. J. Cancer. 2008; 123 :85-88 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, a tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line generated from long-term tamoxifen treatment in MCF7 cells, TamR-1, has naturally increased XBP1 splicing events compared with its parental MCF7 cells ( Figure 4 K). The naturally augmented XBP1 splicing may promote survival and adaptation to stress of cancer cells. To mimic common stressors tumor cells encounter in vivo (for example stress upon tumor dissemination and nutrient shortage), we cultured TamR-1 cells in vitro in ultra-low attachment plates or serum-depleted medium, respectively. Under both stress conditions, IRE1 inhibition significantly increased apoptosis of TamR-1 cells upon tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 4 L), indicating that blocking XBP1 splicing can efficiently reverse tamoxifen resistance. This pro-apoptotic effect was largely inhibited upon ERα silencing ( Figure S4 D), revealing that the sensitivity of cells to the IRE1 inhibitor is, at least in part, dependent on ERα. Together, our data reveal a previously unknown post-transcriptional function of ERα in XBP1 splicing that has clinical relevance and the potential for targeted therapies in breast cancer.
Besides mRNA splicing, binding to mRNA by RBPs may also contribute to other types of post-transcriptional regulation, such as mRNA translation and degradation. Blocking the RNA-binding ability of ERα or silencing ERα dramatically reduces the protein abundance of eIF4G2 and MCL1 in MCF7 and T47D cells ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Figure S5 A) without effects on their mRNA expression ( Figure 5 C; Figure S5 B). Moreover, blocking proteasome-mediated protein degradation with a specific proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, did not rescue the reduction in eIF4G2 and MCL1 proteins induced by ERα RNA-binding deficiency ( Figure S5 C). To ascertain whether MCL1 and eIF4G2 are regulated by ERα at the translational level, we examined their distribution in polysomes (translationally active ribosome fractions) on sucrose gradient fractionation. Although mutation of the ERα RBD did not result in noticeable alterations in global protein synthesis ( Figure 5 D), it affects translation of specific mRNAs. Specifically, we observed an accumulation of MCL1 and eIF4G2 mRNAs in less translationally active polysome (light polysomes) or translationally inactive fractions ( Figure 5 E) but not the control α-tubulin mRNA ( Figure S5 D). ERα does not bind to other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family mRNAs ( BCL2 and BCL2L1 ) ( Figure S5 E), suggesting that ERα controls mRNA translation in a transcript-specific manner.
Translation of mRNAs is frequently regulated by their 5′ UTRs and 3′ UTRs ( Mazumder et al., 2003 59. Mazumder, B. ∙ Seshadri, V. ∙ Fox, P.L. Translational control by the 3′-UTR: the ends specify the means Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28 :91-98 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wells et al., 1998 91. Wells, S.E. ∙ Hillner, P.E. ∙ Vale, R.D. ... Circularization of mRNA by eukaryotic translation initiation factors Mol. Cell. 1998; 2 :135-140 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated two constructs; one only has the full-length eIF4G2 5′ UTR cloned upstream of the firefly reporter, and the other has its 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR incorporated upstream and downstream of the firefly reporter, respectively ( Figure 5 F). The reporter activity (Firefly/Renilla) of these constructs in ERα WT and RBDmut MCF7 cells was normalized to their luciferase mRNA levels. Comparing cells harboring WT and RBDmut ERα, we observed that, although there is no significant difference in the activity of a reporter containing only the 5′ UTR of eIF4G2, there is a dramatic reduction in the 3′ UTR-containing reporter activity when ERα cannot bind RNA ( Figure 5 F). We next wanted to find out whether altering the ERα-bound sequences of eIF4G2 may also block its translation. To this end, deleting the ERα-bound sequences in the eIF4G2 3′ UTR (EIF4G2_Δ) caused notable inhibition of reporter activity in cells with WT ERα, which is less evident in those with ERα RBDmut ( Figure 5 G), suggesting that blocking the RNA-binding ability of ERα or the ability of the eIF4G2 transcript to bind ERα is sufficient to repress translation of eIF4G2 mediated by ERα.
Intriguingly, from our ERα immunoprecipitation (IP) mass spectrometry data we found that ERα may interact with eIF4A1, an RNA helicase of the translation initiation complex and, importantly, one of the key translation regulators of MCL1 ( Robert et al., 2014 71. Robert, F. ∙ Roman, W. ∙ Bramoullé, A. ... Translation initiation factor eIF4F modifies the dexamethasone response in multiple myeloma Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :13421-13426 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether regulation of MCL1 translation by ERα is through eIF4A1, we first validated the interaction between ERα and eIF4A1 ( Figure 5 H). Furthermore, treatment with a clinical eIF4A-specific inhibitor, zotatifin, significantly decreases MCL1 protein, whereas this reduction is less evident in cells with ERα RBDmut cells, suggesting that regulation of MCL1 by ERα is, at least in part, through eIF4A1 ( Figure 5 I).
Together our data reveal that ERα is a multifaceted RBP involved in a variety of RNA post-transcriptional regulation processes, including translation control and RNA splicing.
Given that ERα controls post-transcriptional regulation of eIF4G2, MCL1, and XBP1, we next wanted to find out whether these proteins are overexpressed in human breast cancer. We first obtained human breast tumors and normal adjacent tissue from 14 individuals diagnosed with ERα+ breast cancer. We observed a significant increase in eIF4G2, MCL1, and XBP1s protein abundance in tumors compared with normal adjacent tissue ( Figure 6 A; Figure S6 A). We further performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of these proteins on breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMA) that contained a total of 65 ERα+ invasive breast carcinomas and 8 normal adjacent tissue biopsies. In accordance with our western blot data, we observed significantly augmented expression of these proteins in tumor compared with normal tissue ( Figure 6 B; Figure S6 B). We also analyzed the correlation between protein and mRNA expression data of eIF4G2, MCL1, and GREB1 (an ERα transcriptional target as a control) in breast cancer tumor samples from a published database ( Krug et al., 2020 42. Krug, K. ∙ Jaehnig, E.J. ∙ Satpathy, S. ..., Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Proteogenomic Landscape of Breast Cancer Tumorigenesis and Targeted Therapy Cell. 2020; 183 :1436-1456.e31 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed a notable correlation between GREB1 protein and mRNA expression ( Figure 6 C; Pearson r = 0.7586), consistent with the fact that GREB1 is often regulated at the transcriptional level. In comparison, there is a lack of correlation between protein and mRNA expression of eIF4G2 and MCL1 ( Figure 6 C; Pearson r = 0.3137 and 0.2087, respectively). The lack of RNA and protein correlation suggests that, in human breast cancer, post-transcriptional means of regulation (notably, translation mediated by ERα) can be a key determinant of gene expression changes.
Cancer cells are usually exposed to stressful environments when forming tumors in vivo , which includes not only challenging tumor growth conditions, such as hypoxia and nutrient shortage, but also stress induced by anti-cancer therapies ( Andruska et al., 2015 3. Andruska, N.D. ∙ Zheng, X. ∙ Yang, X. ... Estrogen receptor α inhibitor activates the unfolded protein response, blocks protein synthesis, and induces tumor regression Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Because ERα target mRNAs, particularly XBP1 , MCL1 , and EIF4G2 , are overexpressed in human breast cancer and essential for cells to overcome cellular stress and survive ( Fritsch et al., 2007 23.

XBP1 is essential for survival under hypoxic conditions and is required for tumor growth Cancer Res. 2004; 64 :5943-5947 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that ERα RNA binding may also be crucial for cancer cells to survive and overcome unfavorable growth conditions and anti-cancer therapies. Pharmacologically targeting ERα transcription signaling by endocrine therapies, such as the ER modulator 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) shows high efficacy in the majority of ERα+ diseases, but a notable portion of individuals eventually develop drug resistance ( Ali and Coombes, 2002 2. Ali, S. ∙ Coombes, R.C. Endocrine-responsive breast cancer and strategies for combating resistance Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2 :101-112 Crossref Scopus (735) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, ERα remains functionally important in the resistance of disease, and multiple mechanisms responsible for endocrine resistance have been proposed ( Hanker et al., 2020 30. Hanker, A.B. ∙ Sudhan, D.R. ∙ Arteaga, C.L.

Biological determinants of endocrine resistance in breast cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9 :631-643 Crossref Scopus (1044) PubMed Google Scholar ; Osborne and Schiff, 2011 65. Osborne, C.K. ∙ Schiff, R. Mechanisms of endocrine resistance in breast cancer Annu. Rev. Med. 2011; 62 :233-247 Crossref Scopus (939) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, ERα is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein whose cytoplasmic proportion increases upon long-term tamoxifen treatment ( Fan et al., 2007 21. Fan, P. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Santen, R.J. ... Long-term treatment with tamoxifen facilitates translocation of estrogen receptor alpha out of the nucleus and enhances its interaction with EGFR in MCF-7 breast cancer cells Cancer Res. 2007; 67 :1352-1360 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the non-genomic function of ERα in the cytoplasm may also play an important role in resistance. Intriguingly, treating breast cancer cells with tamoxifen or the selective ER degrader (SERD) fulvestrant induced cellular stress, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, represented by increased phosphorylation of eIF2α ( Figure S6 C), which, if not overcome, will lead to cell death. Thus, handling stress by ERα RNA binding may be crucial for cancer cells to survive and develop resistance. In this regard, the RNA-bound proportions of ERα approximately doubled in tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells (TamR-1 and TamR M ) generated from long-term tamoxifen treatment ( Lykkesfeldt et al., 1994 56. Lykkesfeldt, A.E. ∙ Madsen, M.W. ∙ Briand, P. Altered expression of estrogen-regulated genes in a tamoxifen-resistant and ICI 164,384 and ICI 182,780 sensitive human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7/TAMR-1 Cancer Res. 1994; 54 :1587-1595 PubMed Google Scholar ; Raha et al., 2015 68. Raha, P. ∙ Thomas, S. ∙ Thurn, K.T. ... Combined histone deacetylase inhibition and tamoxifen induces apoptosis in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer models, by reversing Bcl-2 overexpression Breast Cancer Res. 2015; 17 :26 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as MCF7 cells stably overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), one of the phenotypes for tamoxifen resistance in human breast cancer ( Shou et al., 2004 78. Shou, J. ∙ Massarweh, S. ∙ Osborne, C.K. ... Mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance: increased estrogen receptor-HER2/neu cross-talk in ER/HER2-positive breast cancer J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96 :926-935 Crossref Scopus (1021) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 6 D). These cells are insensitive to tamoxifen and resistant to tamoxifen-induced G1 arrest and apoptosis. Similar to XBP1 splicing ( Figure 4 I), TamR-1 cells exhibit increased eIF4G2 and MCL1 protein abundance ( Figure 6 E) without significant changes in their transcript levels compared with tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cells ( Figure S6 D). These results indicate that ERα RNA binding and its post-transcriptional targets may have a functional role in the tamoxifen response of breast cancer.
We next implanted TamR-1 cells harboring RBDmut and WT ERα into NSG mice and observed tumor growth inhibition upon tamoxifen administration of TamR-1 cells when the RBD of ERα is mutated ( Figure 6 F). To investigate the mechanism underlying tamoxifen re-sensitization, we cultured ERα WT and RBDmut TamR-1 cells and detected significant but mild G1 arrest when ERα RBD was mutated ( Figure S6 E). We further examined ERα WT and RBDmut TamR-1 cells under stress conditions, including culture in ultra-low attachment plates or serum-depleted medium, together with tamoxifen treatment. Intriguingly, TamR-1 cells without ERα RNA-binding activity are more sensitive to these stressors together with tamoxifen treatment, leading to a notable increase in apoptosis that is not observed under normal conditions ( Figure 6 G). These results indicate that ERα-RNA association may be particularly important for cancer cells to overcome cellular stress.
We next sought to functionally characterize the role of ERα targets in facilitating breast cancer survival and during endocrine therapy. Similar to the phenotype of TamR-1 cells with ERα RBDmut, under normal cell culture conditions, silencing eIF4G2 using small interfering RNA (siRNA; siEIF4G2) together with tamoxifen treatment only resulted in increased G1 cell cycle arrest ( Figure S6 F), whereas no significant cell apoptosis was observed ( Figure S6 G). Importantly, providing eIF4G2-silenced cells with cell stressors dramatically increased the percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 6 H). This phenomenon was also observed when MCL1 was targeted pharmacologically with a specific inhibitor, where the effect of MCL1 inhibition on cell apoptosis was more evident under conditions such as nutrient deprivation or suspension under tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 6 I; Figure S6 H). These data strongly suggest that ERα-mediated post-transcriptional regulation plays an essential role in cancer cell adaptation to stressful environments and maintenance of cell survival.

Section: Discussion

ERα is known as a master transcription factor controlling expression of key genes involved in breast cancer progression. Our work shows the importance of ERα post-transcriptional regulation as another key determinant of its oncogenic potential. Emerging evidence has revealed that alterations of the expression and function of RBPs can serve as key oncogenic events and may amplify the effects of cancer drivers in promoting tumor progression ( Pereira et al., 2017 67. Pereira, B. ∙ Billaud, M. ∙ Almeida, R. RNA-Binding Proteins in Cancer: Old Players and New Actors Trends Cancer. 2017; 3 :506-528 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has mapped the RNA interactomes of hundreds of human canonical RBPs using enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) assays ( Van Nostrand et al., 2020 87. Van Nostrand, E.L. ∙ Freese, P. ∙ Pratt, G.A. ... A large-scale binding and functional map of human RNA-binding proteins Nature. 2020; 583 :711-719 Crossref Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar ), it remains poorly understood how non-canonical RBPs associate with RNAs and how these non-canonical functions are related to cancer and disease. It is therefore intriguing to discover that the RNA-binding activity of ERα is uncoupled from its classical chromatin-binding function, which provides an ideal platform to study at which step of tumor progression the function of a non-canonical RBP becomes specifically crucial. Importantly, the RNA-binding function can also apply to other nuclear receptors, such as the GR, which may also participate in the cancer development ( Ishmael et al., 2011 37. Ishmael, F.T. ∙ Fang, X. ∙ Houser, K.R. ... The human glucocorticoid receptor as an RNA-binding protein: global analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-associated transcripts and identification of a target RNA motif J. Immunol. 2011; 186 :1189-1198 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Employing unbiased genome-wide CLIP sequencing (CLIP-seq) and functional genomics screen, we uncovered an oncogenic program comprised of hundreds of mRNAs bound by ERα, particularly a group of mRNAs involved in the adaptive response to stress that may represent a unique role of the post-transcriptional regulation function of ERα in cancer. Cancer cells are constantly exposed to multiple stressors during tumor growth and metastasis formation, including external signals such as hypoxia, nutrient shortage, immune attack, as well as delivery of anticancer drugs. Endocrine therapy results in rapid activation of stress signaling ( Andruska et al., 2015 3. Andruska, N.D. ∙ Zheng, X. ∙ Yang, X. ... Estrogen receptor α inhibitor activates the unfolded protein response, blocks protein synthesis, and induces tumor regression Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :4737-4742 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cook et al., 2014 15. Cook, K.L. ∙ Clarke, P.A. ∙ Parmar, J. ...

Overcoming cellular stress is therefore critical for cancer cell survival and may also serve as a potential drug target ( Chen and Cubillos-Ruiz, 2021 12. Chen, X. ∙ Cubillos-Ruiz, J.R. Endoplasmic reticulum stress signals in the tumour and its microenvironment Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2021; 21 :71-88 Crossref Scopus (583) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gaillard et al., 2015 24. Gaillard, H. ∙ García-Muse, T. ∙ Aguilera, A. Replication stress and cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15 :276-289 Crossref Scopus (696) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hayes et al., 2020 32. Hayes, J.D. ∙ Dinkova-Kostova, A.T. ∙ Tew, K.D. Oxidative Stress in Cancer Cancer Cell. 2020; 38 :167-197 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1338) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jin and Saatcioglu, 2020 39. Jin, Y. ∙ Saatcioglu, F. Targeting the Unfolded Protein Response in Hormone-Regulated Cancers Trends Cancer. 2020; 6 :160-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this respect, translational control or alternative splicing of stress response mRNAs by ERα may be a fast way of controlling protein production and may be particularly important for breast cancer cells to adapt to various stressors in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, this functional preference of the non-canonical activity of ERα in the adaptive response to stress may differ from that of its classical transcriptional role (e.g., in stimulating cell proliferation), which may provide extra advantages for the fitness of breast cancer cells.
Historically, breast cancer research has focused mainly on genomic and transcriptional alterations underlying tumor development. However, post-transcriptional regulation is known to be a key determinant of final protein production required for adaptation of cells to altered tumor microenvironments ( Liu et al., 2016 52. Liu, Y. ∙ Beyer, A. ∙ Aebersold, R. On the Dependency of Cellular Protein Levels on mRNA Abundance Cell. 2016; 165 :535-550 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1882) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu and Ruggero, 2020 93. Xu, Y.C. ∙ Ruggero, D. The Role of Translation Control in Tumorigenesis and Its Therapeutic Implications Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2020; 4 :437-457 Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar ). In addition, post-transcriptional gene regulation is not typically detected by genomics and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies, limiting the predictive power of mRNA-based prognostic biomarkers, especially when production of key pro-tumor proteins is not associated with changes in mRNA abundance (e.g., eIF4G2 and MCL1 in this study; Figure 6 C). In this respect, our results are vital for delineating ERα non-genomic functional partners (e.g., RtcB) as well as downstream post-transcriptional effectors (e.g., XBP1s, eIF4G2, and MCL1) that may also serve as relevant biomarkers and offer an innovative line of therapies targeting selective vulnerabilities for advanced breast cancer. Post-transcriptional regulation, especially translation control, may be hijacked by cancer cells as a means to rapidly escape anti-cancer therapy ( Herviou et al., 2020 33. Herviou, P. ∙ Le Bras, M. ∙ Dumas, L. ... hnRNP H/F drive RNA G-quadruplex-mediated translation linked to genomic instability and therapy resistance in glioblastoma Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2661 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rapino et al., 2018 70. Rapino, F. ∙ Delaunay, S. ∙ Rambow, F. ... Codon-specific translation reprogramming promotes resistance to targeted therapy Nature. 2018; 558 :605-609 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). Targeting the translation control processes ERα mediates by inhibiting the functional partners of ERα in regulating mRNA translation may offer a distinctive therapeutic window for treating breast cancers, especially those resistant to endocrine therapies ( Baselga et al., 2012 5. Baselga, J. ∙ Campone, M. ∙ Piccart, M. ... Everolimus in postmenopausal hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :520-529 Crossref Scopus (2424) PubMed Google Scholar ; Geter et al., 2017 25. Geter, P.A. ∙ Ernlund, A.W. ∙ Bakogianni, S. ... Hyperactive mTOR and MNK1 phosphorylation of eIF4E confer tamoxifen resistance and estrogen independence through selective mRNA translation reprogramming Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :2235-2249 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). More specifically, ERα+ breast cancer cells may be sensitive to therapies that target the stress response for cancer cell survival, such as the ISR. Indeed, we show that targeting one node of the ISR, IRE1-XBP1 signaling, through an IRE1 inhibitor is sufficient to inhibit tumor progression in vivo and promotes death of tamoxifen-resistant cells, revealing a “Achilles’ heel” of ERα+ breast cancer. In this respect, our discovery that a non-genomic function of ERα regulates post-transcriptional gene expression of mRNAs implicated in stress response may be a unique opportunity for researchers to revisit the role and mechanism of this nuclear receptor in broader physiological events and human diseases.
Although our study demonstrated that the RNA-binding function of ERα triggers post-transcriptional regulation of specific mRNAs for cancer cells to overcome stress, several outstanding issues remain. Given that ERα is a key transcription factor in breast cancer and that certain genes (e.g., XBP1 ) are regulated by ERα at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, future work is needed to investigate how the RNA binding and the classical DNA-binding functions of ERα are coordinated. For example, do the agonist and antagonist of this nuclear receptor for DNA binding (e.g., E2, diethylstilbestrol, tamoxifen, fulvestrant, etc.) alter its RNA binding activity? Although we show that the post-transcriptional targets of ERα (e.g., eIF4G2, XBP1, and MCL1) may be crucial for cancer cells to survive stress, Kaplan-Meier analyses should be done to determine prognosis and clinical outcome, especially for those who relapse and become insensitive to therapies.

All cells were cultured in a 37°C 5% CO 2 humidified incubator. 293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, GlutaMAX (1x) (GIBCO), and Penicillin-Streptomycin (100 U/mL) (GIBCO). The MCF7 and T47D cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, GlutaMAX (1x) (GIBCO), and Penicillin-Streptomycin (100 U/mL) (GIBCO). TamR M and TamR-1 cells were cultured in DMEM Ham’s F12 medium containing 10% FBS, GlutaMAX (1x) (GIBCO), Penicillin-Streptomycin (100 U/mL) (GIBCO) and 1 μM of 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma). All cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma-free by the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kits (Lonza).
Eight-week-old NOD scid gamma (NSG) female mice (Bred by UCSF mouse facility) were used for breast xenograft experiments. 60-day slow-release 17β-Estradiol pellets (0.72mg, Innovative Research of America) were first implanted two days before tumor injection. To prepare cancer cells for injection, we briefly trypsinized adherent cancer cells, quenched them with 10% FBS RPMI media, and resuspended them in 1X PBS. Cells were pelleted again and mixed with Matrigel matrix (Corning) on ice. The Matrigel cell suspension was transferred into a 1 mL syringe and remained on ice until the time of implantation. 200 μL of cells (4 × 10 6 for MCF7, 8 × 10 6 for T47D and TamR-1) were then injected subcutaneously and tumor volumes were measured twice per week. For orthotopic model with STF-083010 treatment, 5 × 10 6 MCF7 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of the NSG mice. When tumors reach 150 mm 3 , mice were randomly separated into two groups, and dosed with 30 mg/kg of STF-083010 once per week. Tumor volumes were measured every two weeks. For orthotopic model with Zotatifin treatment, 1mg/kg of Zotatifin were dosed every 2-3 days intraperitoneally.
Human female breast cancer tumor and normal adjacent tissue samples were collected at the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. Patients are aged from 28 to 76. All analyses of human data were carried out in compliance with the relevant ethical regulations.
For generating ERα WT and RBDmut stable cell lines, 3 x FLAG-tagged ERα coding sequence with or without the mutations (259RRGG > 259AAAA) was first cloned into the BamHI and ECoRI sites of the pWPXLd plasmid (Addgene plasmid #12258). The constructs were than packaged using the lentiviral packaging system by using PolyFect (QIAGEN) and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) to transfect the constructs with packaging plasmids into 293T cells. Virus was harvested 48 hours post-transfection and passed through a 0.45 mm filter. Transduced cells were selected by treatment with 2 mg/mL puromycin for 2-3 days. The endogenous ERα was then removed using Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes targeting the introns of ESR1 gene. sgRNAs targeting human ESR1 were designed using the Zhang Lab design tool ( https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources ). Chemically modified synthetic sgRNAs were purchased from Synthego (Menlo Park, CA, USA) and Cas9-NLS purified protein was from the QB3 MacroLab (UC Berkeley, CA, USA). Cas9 RNP was prepared immediately prior to nucleofection by incubating Cas9 protein with sgRNA at 1:1.3 molar ratio in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol and 1 mM TCEP at 37°C for 10 min. Cells were dissociated using trypsin, pelleted by centrifugation, and washed once with D-PBS. Nucleofection of human MCF7 cell line was performed using Amaxa Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (Lonza, Allendale, NJ, USA) and program P-020 on an Amaxa Nucleofector II system, T47D cells was performed with X-005, and TamR-1 cells with E-014 programs. Each nucleofection reaction consisted of ∼5 × 10 5 cells in 50 μL of nucleofection reagent mixed with two distinct 10 μL RNP mixtures containing two sgRNAs (to allow specific deletion of first exon ESR1 coding sequence). 4 days after nucleofection, cells were cultured into 96-well plates with 1 cell per well for single clone selection. The expression of ERα RBDmut and the removal of endogenous ERα were confirmed by sequencing and western blot.
For sample (e.g., western blot lysate) collection, MCF7 and T47D cells harboring WT or RBDmut ERα were plate on cell culture dishes with a 20% confluency, and maintained in the dishes for 48 h, when cell reaches approximately 90% confluency. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scrapped off the dish in PBS, and palleted for further processes. For Zotafitin treatment, WT or RBDmut cells were counted, plated equal amount on cell culture dishes, and maintained in the dishes for 40-48 h until cell reaches 80%–90% confluency and then replaced with fresh media containing Zotafitin.
For stable knockdown using CRISPR sgRNAs, sgRNAs were first cloned into pLG15 vector (Gilbert lab) using Blp1 and BstX1 sites. The constructs were than packaged using the lentiviral packaging system by using PolyFect (QIAGEN) and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) to transfect the constructs with packaging plasmids into 293T cells. Virus was harvested 48 hours post-transfection and passed through a 0.45 mm filter. Transduced cells were selected by treatment with 2 mg/mL puromycin for 2-3 days.
For transient knockdown of target genes, siRNAs (QIAGEN) were used: siESR1: Hs_ESR1_8 FlexiTube siRNA; siEIF4G2: FlexiTube GeneSolution GS1982 for EIF4G2 . 20nM (final concentration) of each siRNA was transfected into 1x10 5 cancer cells using Hiperfect (QIAGEN) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were harvested 48-72 hours post-transfection. Knockdown of target genes was assessed by qRT-PCR as described below.
RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) purification with PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher, 12183018), or by RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RNAs were converted into cDNAs using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and 1 μL of template was used in a PowerUP SYBR Green master mix reaction run on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher).
For measuring XBP1 splicing, RNAs were purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), converted into cDNAs using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10, and amplified using primers F: 5′- TTACGAGAGAAAACTCATGGC-3′. R: 5′- GGGTCCAAGTTGTCCAGAATGC-3′ with RT-PCR. PCR products were run on 2% TAE gels.
2,000 cells per well of MCF7 and T47D with and without the RBD mutation of ERα were plated in 96-well plates. Cells were fixed every 24 hours by gentle addition of 100 mL of 40% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (w/v) (final concentration of 10% TCA) per well. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at 4°C, washed five times with distilled water, and stained with 100 mL of sulforho- damine B (SRB) solution 0.4% (w/v) in 1% acetic acid for 1 hour at room temperature. Unbound dye was removed by washing plates five times with 1% acetic acid. Bound stain was solubilized by the addition of 100 mL of 10 mM tris base. Absorbance was determined on an automated plate reader (96-well microtiter) at 492 nm. In addition, CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, WI, USA) was performed following manufacturer’s instructions with luminescence measurements made using a Glomax 96-well plate luminometer (Promega). Proliferation data were generated by first normalizing luminescence intensity in each well to the wells with ERα WT cells, and normalized luminescence data was plotted (±SD) from at least three independent experiments. Unpaired t test was used to test for significant variations.
MCF7 cells were collected by scraping, then centrifuged to pellet. The pellets were then resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 1X protease inhibitors), incubated on ice for 15 minutes, supplied with 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, homogenized for 10 strokes and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 x g at 4°C. The supernatant was collected (cytosolic fraction). Immunoprecipitation of ERα was carried out using anti-ERα and rabbit IgG antibodies with dynabeads (Invitrogen), all according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cytosolic lysates were then incubated with antibody-conjugated beads with end-over-end rotation at 4°C overnight. The beads were then washed three times with ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, and then three times with ice-cold PBS. Proteins were eluted from beads with 1X LDS loading dye and separated on TGX Stain-free protein gels (Bio-Rad), allowing the bromophenol blue marker to reach 1 cm inside the gel. Gel was stained using ProtoBlue Safe Colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 stain. The upper portion of the lanes containing the proteins was excised and digested in-gel with trypsin as described previously ( Rosenfeld et al., 1992 75. Rosenfeld, J. ∙ Capdevielle, J. ∙ Guillemot, J.C. ... In-gel digestion of proteins for internal sequence analysis after one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203 :173-179 Crossref Scopus (1163) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extracted digests were vacuum-evaporated and dried samples were labeled according TMT 6-plex kit instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific), with minor modifications. Shortly, peptides were resuspended in 4 μL of 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate buffer. TMT reagents were resuspended in 41 μL acetonitrile per vial, and 20 μL of this solution were added to the individual samples (Era IP and mock control) to be labeled. After incubating for 1 h at 22°C, reactions were quenched by adding 4 μL 5% hydroxylamine and incubated for additional 15 min. After that, the labeling reactions were combined, partially evaporated to close to 5 μl, diluted in 100 μL 0.1% formic and desalted using a ZipTip C18 (Millipore) as indicated by the manufacturer. Peptides were eluted in 2x7 μL aliquots of 50% MeCN 0.1% formic acid, dried and resuspended in 5 μL 0.1% formic acid for mass spectrometry analysis on a QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) connected to a NanoAcquity Ultra Performance UPLC system (Waters). A 15-cm EasySpray C18 column (Thermo Scientific) was used to resolve peptides (60-min 2%–30% B gradient with 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase B, at a flow rate of 300 nl/min). MS was operated in positive mode in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS. MS spectra were acquired between 350 and 1500 m/z with a resolution of 70000. For each MS spectrum, the top 10 ions with a charge state of 2+ or higher were selected with an isolation window of 1 m/z. Precursor ions were fragmented by HCD using stepped relative collision energies of 25, 35 and 40 in order to ensure efficient generation of sequence ions as well as TMT reporter ions. MS/MS spectra were acquired in centroid mode with resolution 17500 from m/z = 100. A dynamic exclusion window was applied which prevented the same m/z from being selected for 10 s after its acquisition.
Peak lists were generated using PAVA in-house software ( Guan et al., 2011 28. Guan, S. ∙ Price, J.C. ∙ Prusiner, S.B. ... A data processing pipeline for mammalian proteome dynamics studies using stable isotope metabolic labeling Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2011; 10 M111.010728 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) Google Scholar ). All generated peak lists were searched against the human subset of the SwissProt database, using Protein Prospector (2015.12.1 release), using Protein Prospector ( Clauser et al., 1999 14. Clauser, K.R. ∙ Baker, P. ∙ Burlingame, A.L. Role of accurate mass measurement (+/- 10 ppm) in protein identification strategies employing MS or MS/MS and database searching Anal. Chem. 1999; 71 :2871-2882 Crossref Scopus (992) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following parameters: Enzyme specificity was set as Trypsin, and up to 2 missed cleavages per peptide were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, and TMT labeling of lysine residues and N terminus of the protein were allowed as fixed modifications. N-acetylation of the N terminus of the protein, loss of protein N-terminal methionine, pyroglutamate formation from of peptide N-terminal glutamines, oxidation of methionine were allowed as variable modifications. Mass tolerance was 10 ppm in MS and 30 ppm in MS/MS. The false positive rate was estimated by searching the data using a concatenated database which contains the original SwissProt database, as well as a version of each original entry where the sequence has been randomized. A 1% FDR was permitted at the protein and peptide level. For quantitation only unique peptides were considered; peptides common to several proteins were not used for quantitative analysis. Relative quantization of peptide abundance was performed via calculation of the intensity of reporter ions corresponding to the different TMT labels, present in MS/MS spectra. Intensities were determined by Protein Prospector. Summed intensity on each TMT channel for all identified spectra were used to normalize individual intensity values. Relative abundances were calculated as ratios of the intensities in ERα IP channel versus the channel corresponding to mock (IgG) pulldown. For total protein relative levels, peptide ratios were aggregated to the protein levels using median values of the log2 ratios.
Co-immunoprecipitation of ERα and RtcB or eIF4A1 was performed using lysate prepared from MCF7 cells. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1X PBS, collected by scraping, then centrifuged to pellet. Cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 1X protease inhibitors), incubated on ice for 15 minutes, supplied with 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, homogenized for 10 strokes and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 x g at 4°C. The supernatant was collected (cytosolic fraction). ERα- or IgG-conjugated dynabeads were added to lysate and incubated for overnight at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. Beads were then washed three times with ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630. Proteins were eluted by resuspending beads in loading buffer (1x NuPAGE LDS loading buffer, 50mM DTT) and incubating for 5 minutes at 95°C. The presence of RtcB or eIF4A1 in input and immunoprecipitated fractions was assessed by western blot as described below.
20 mg/mL Oligo(dT)-cellulose beads (Sigma, O3131, or comparable brands with > 40 A260 units per gram polyA RNA binding capacity) were swelled in wash buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 RNasin (promega)] overnight at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. Cell lysates from MCF7, T47D and TamR cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scrape into 1 mL ice-cold lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Triton-X, RNasin (promega) and 1X protease inhibitors]. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and lysed with ten strokes of a chilled dounce homogenizer. Lysates were spun down at 14,000 xg at 4°C, and supernatant were collected. Protein concentrations were determined using Braford Assay (Bio-Rad), and lysate containing equal amount of proteins were added to the swelled Oligo(dT) beads and samples were end-over-end rotated for 2 h at 4°C. Samples were spun down at 2,500 xg for 2 min, and beads were subsequently washed 5x with wash buffer, and samples were eluted from the beads with 2x Laemmili loading buffer with 10 mM DTT, boiled at 95°C for 10 min, with votexting every 1 min. Samples were analyzed by western blot.
Cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold RIPA buffer (25mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 0.15M NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1X protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. Samples were boiled in 1X LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) and 100mM DTT. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4%–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels, transferred to 0.2 μm Nitrocellulose Membrane (Thermo Scientific). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed using target-specific antibodies in 2.5% BSA in PBST. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
HITS-CLIP was performed as previously described. Biological replicates of MCF7 cells were crosslinked with 400 mJ/cm 2 254nm UV. Crosslinked cells were then lysed on ice in low salt buffer (1X PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630) supplemented with Recombinant RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega) and 1X protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysate was then treated with DNase I (Promega) at 37°C for 5 minutes. Lysate was then treated with RNase A (low dilution: 1:1500; high dilution: 1:30) (Thermo Scientific) and incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes. Lysate was clarified by spinning at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 20 minutes. The clarified lysate was transferred to protein A dynabeads (Invitrogen) conjugated to anti-ERα antibody (Santa Cruz sc-542) and rotated end-over-end at 4°C for 3 hours. The beads were washed twice with low salt buffer, high salt buffer (5X PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630), and PNK buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 10mM MgCl 2 , 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630), respectively. The immunoprecipitated protein-RNA complexes were first dephosphorylated on-bead with CIP (NEB), washed once with PNK buffer, once with PNK + EGTA buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 20mM EGTA, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630), lastly twice with PNK buffer. T4 RNA ligase (Thermo Scientific) was used to ligate a 5′ RNA linker [ 32 P-labeled RL3: 5′(-OH)-GUGUCAGUCACUUCCAGCGG-3′-(3InvdT)] to the samples on-bead overnight at 16°C, followed by 1X low salt buffer, 1X high salt buffer, and 2X PNK buffer washings. The samples were then phosphorylated on-bead using PNK (NEB), followed by 2X PNK washes, and then eluted by 70°C heating for 10 minutes in 1X NuPAGE LDS loading buffer at 1,000rpm. The eluates were separated on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), transferred to Whatman BA85 nitrocellulose (Sigma), and exposed to film (24-72 h) to determine the migration of the RNA-protein complexes, and the relevant region was cut from the membrane for library preparation and cut into small pieces on a whatman paper and transferred to Eppendorf tubes.
The RNA from the membrane was then isolated by digesting with 200 μL of proteinase K solution [4mg/mL proteinase K (Invitrogen), 100mM Tris pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 10mM EDTA] and incubating at 37°C for 20 minutes at 1,000rpm. 200 μL PK-urea solution (100mM Tris pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 10mM EDTA, 7M urea) were subsequently added and samples were incubated at 37°C for another 20 minutes at 1,000rpm. Lastly, 400 μL acid phenol (Sigma) and 130 mL chloroform (Sigma) were added and samples were continuously incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes at 1,000rpm. Tubes were vortexed and spun, and RNA was precipitated from the aqueous layer. The RNA pellet was washed and ligated to the RL5D linker [5′(-OH)-AGGGAGGACGAUGCGGr(N)r(N)r(N)r(N)G-3′(-OH)] using T4 RNA ligase and incubating overnight at 16°C. The ligation reaction was then treated with DNase I (Promega), extracted with acid phenol chloroform, and the aqueous layer was precipitated. The RNA was purified and cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with customized DP3 primer (5′-CCGCTGGAAGTGACTGACAC-3′), using 50°C for 45 minutes, 55°C for 15 minutes, and 90°C for 5 minutes program. The first round of PCR was then carried out using DP5 (5′-AGGGAGGACGATGCGG-3′) and DP3 primers with Accuprime Pfx Supermix (Invitrogen) using the following cycle conditions: 1. 95°C 2min, 2. 95°C 20 s, 3. 58°C 30 s, 4. 68°C 20 s, 5. 68°C 5min, with Steps 2-4 repeated 24 times. The PCR products were gel purified using 10% Urea-TBE PAGE with QIAGEN Gel extraction kit. A second PCR step was then performed to attach Illumina flowcell adaptor sequences using DSFP5 (5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACTATGGATACTTAGTCAGGGAGGACGATGCGG-3′) and DSFP3 (5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGACCGCTGGAAGTGACTGACAC-3′) primers, with the following cycle conditions: 1. 95°C 2min, 2. 95°C 20 s, 3. 58°C 30 s, 4. 68°C 40 s, 5. 68°C 5min, with Steps 2-4 repeated 6 times. Lastly, the PCR products were gel purified using a 2% metaphor agarose (Lonza) gel. The resulting libraries were sequenced using SSP1 primer (5′-CTATGGATACTTAGTCAGGGAGGACGATGCGG-3′) as the custom sequencing primer.
To identify ERα-bound sites from the ERα CLIP-seq data, first the adaptor sequences were removed and quality trimming was performed Cutadapt. Reads were then mapped to the human genome (build hg19) using BWA (v.0.7.) with the default parameters. The ERα binding sites were then identified using the CTK package. For our analysis, the CLIP-derived ERα binding sites from all of the samples were combined to create the list of ERα binding sites.
For the conservation analysis, the PhastCons ( Siepel et al., 2005 79. Siepel, A. ∙ Bejerano, G. ∙ Pedersen, J.S. ... Evolutionarily conserved elements in vertebrate, insect, worm, and yeast genomes Genome Res. 2005; 15 :1034-1050 Crossref Scopus (2861) PubMed Google Scholar ) scores of CLIP-derived ERα binding sites were calculated and plotted using the Conservation Plot tool of Cistrome ( http://cistrome.org/ap/root ).
The XBP1 3′UTR DNA was synthesized by IDT, and PCR amplified with a 5′ primer containing a T7 promoter sequence. The XBP1 3′UTR mRNA fragment (1-400 nt) were synthesized using MEGAscript T7 in vitro transcription kit (Thermo Fisher) followed by Turbo DNase digestion to remove residue DNA. Purified GST-ERα protein was resuspended in RNase-free water to required concentrations, and 5 μL of the proteins were added into each well of a 96-well qPCR plate. XBP1 3′UTR mRNAs were diluted using RNase-free water, and 5 μL of them or RNase-free water (control) were added to each well containing different concentrations of GST-ERα protein. 2.5 μL of 50X SYPRO Orange Fluorescent Dye (Thermo Fisher) were added to each well to make a final concentration of 5X. Protein melt curve was measured using CFX RT-PCR detection systems (Bio-Rad).
MCF7 cells harboring WT or RBDmut ERα were counted, plated equal number of cells on 15-cm cell culture dish at the concentration of approximately 20%–25%, maintained for 48 h until cells became 90% confluent. Cell were then treated with 0.1 mg/ml Cycloheximide for 5 min, prior to lysing in 300 μL of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 200 U/ml RNasin (Promega)). Nuclei and membrane debris were then removed by centrifuging at 10,000 g, 5 min. The lysate was loaded onto a sucrose gradient (10%–50% sucrose(w/v) made with Gradient Master™ (BIOCOMP), 20 mM Tris pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl 2 ) and centrifuged in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman) for 2.5 h at 38,000 rpm at 4°C. Fractions were collected by density gradient fractionation system Piston Gradient Fractionator ™ (BIOCOMP).
The 5′UTR and 3′UTR of eIF4G2 mRNA were cloned into the pGL3-promoter vector, before and after the Firefly reporter coding sequence, respectively. For deleting the ERα-binding sites in eIF4G2 3′UTR, gBlock DNA of eIF4G2 3′UTR with ERα-binding sites deleted were ordered from IDT. Details of the ERα-bound eIF4G2 3′UTR regions are uploaded to GEO, which can be accessed with the accession code: GSM5272770. MCF7 cells were transfected with 200 ng of pGL3-eIF4G2 constructs and 20 ng of pRL (Renilla luciferase) plasmid using Amaxa Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (Lonza, Allendale, NJ, USA) and program P-020 on an Amaxa Nucleofector II system. Cells were collected 48 h post-transfection and half of the cells were assayed using Dual luciferase kit (Promega), the other half were proceeded for TRIzol (Invitrogen) purification of RNA. Purified RNAs were treated twice with Turbo DNase to remove Firefly and Renilla plasmids, and reverse transcribed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity, and further normalized to Firefly and Renilla luciferase RNA levels quantified by RT-qPCR.
To generate customized CRISPRi sub-library targeting ERα-bound mRNAs, sgRNA oligo pool was first generated with Twist Bioscience (Table S4), and was used as a template for PCR amplifications using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher), and the following cycle condition: 1. 98°C 30 s, 2. 98°C 15 s, 3. 56°C 15 s, 4. 72°C 15 s, 5. 72°C 10 min, with Steps 2-4 repeated 15 times. PCR products were purified using QIAGEN’s MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit. The expected PCR product size is 84bp, which can be determined by TBE gel. 5 μg of pLG1 library vector (Gilbert Lab) and 1 μg of PCR products were digested using FastDigest BstXI and BlpI (1 h for vector, 4 h for PCR products) at 37°C, Digested pLG1 vector was gel purified using Gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). Digested PCR products (inserts) were run on 10% acrylamide gel, crushed using 18.5-gauge needle and by spinning down through a 0.5 mL nonstick tube with a hole to 1.5 mL tube. 200 μL water was added to the gel pieces and samples were incubated for 1 h at 70°C, followed by spinning down for 3 min at 20,000 xg through Costar Spin-X columns. Elutes free of gel debris were proceeded to isopropanol precipitation. Purified vector and inserts (1:1 ratio) were ligated using T4 ligase at 16°C for 16 h, followed by purifications with ethanol precipitation. Transformations were performed using electroporation with Mega X cells (1 μL of ligation with 20 μL of cells), followed by recovery at 37°C for 1 h, and culture in 100 mL LB overnight at 37°C. Plasmids were purified using QIAGEN Midiprep kit.
For CRISPRi screen, MCF7 cells were first stably overexpressed doxycycline-inducible dCas9, and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with Tet-free serum. MCF7-dCas9 cells were then infected with CRISPRi sub-library plasmids followed by 48 h puromycin selection. The efficient infection of the library can be determined by flow cytometry. After the selection, cells were treated with doxycycline for 4 days to induce the dCas9 expression, and the Day 0 time point was collected snap frozen at −80°C, and cell numbers were determined by flow cytometry. Cells were continuously cultured in the RPMI-1640 medium with Tet-free serum containing doxycycline for required days, and for each time points cell numbers were counted by flow cytometry. Cells at each time points were lysed and genomic DNAs (gDNAs) were harvested using NucleoSpin Blood XL kit following manufactural instructions. Purified gDNAs were digested with SbfI-HF (NEB) at the concentration of 400 U per 1 mg of gDNA, followed by purifications. gDNAs from each time points and replicates were amplified using Q5 PCR MasterMix (NEB) with the following cycle conditions: 1. 98°C 30 s, 2. 98°C 10 s, 3. 65°C 75 s, 4. 65°C 5 min, with Steps 2-3 repeated 22 times. PCR products were purified and sequenced.
MCF7 cells with ERα WT and RBDmut were grown in complete RPMI-1640 media to 80%–90% confluency. The media were removed and replaced with media containing 1% formaldehyde and crosslinked for 8 min at 37°C, followed by quenching with Glycine at a final concentration of 0.2 M. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and lysed in 10 mL of LB1 buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, and 0.25% Triton X-100) for 10 min at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 10 mL of LB2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM EGTA), and mixed at 4°C for 5 min with end-over-end rotation. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 300 mL of LB3 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine) and sonicated in Diagenode Bioruptor. Triton X-100 was added to the lysate at a final concentration of 1%, and lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 xg. The supernatant was then incubated with 100 μL of protein A dynabeads (Invitrogen) prebound with FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibody, and immunoprecipitation (IP) was conducted overnight at 4°C with end-over-end rotation.
Beads were washed 6 times in RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.7% Na deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 and 0.5 M LiCl), followed by 1-time wash with TE buffer. 100 μL of elution buffer (% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO 3 ) were added to the beads, and incubated overnight at 65°C to reverse crosslink. 170 μL of elution buffer was added to 30 μL input samples. Samples were then added with 200 μL of TE, treated with RNase A for 1 h at 37°C, followed by Proteinase K for 2 h at 55°C. Samples were purified with Phenol: Chloroform: Isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitations. DNA pallets were washed once with 75% ice-cold ethanol and resuspended in 50 μL of 10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0. Samples can be assessed by qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) or processed for sequencing library preparation (ChIP-seq) following the manufactural instructions of NEBNext Ultra II DNA library Prep Kit (NEB).
Sequences generated by the Illumina Genome Analyzer were processed by the Illumina analysis pipeline and aligned to the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37), using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 44. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ). Enriched regions of the genome were determined using MACS2 peak caller ( Feng et al., 2012 22. Feng, J. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Qin, B. ... Identifying ChIP-seq enrichment using MACS Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :1728-1740 Crossref Scopus (1114) PubMed Google Scholar ) by comparing the FLAG-ERα ChIP samples with the input controls. Further analyses were performed with Cistrome ( Liu et al., 2011 51. Liu, T. ∙ Ortiz, J.A. ∙ Taing, L. ... Cistrome: an integrative platform for transcriptional regulation studies Genome Biol. 2011; 12 :R83 Crossref Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For differential binding analysis, the peaks called from each sample were merged using samtools and the unique records were stored as a union bed file. The aligned reads were then intersected with the union of the peaks. The number of intersections for each peak were counted and a counts matrix was generated. The count matrix was then analyzed with two-way comparison using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 54. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ) for statistical testing comparing RBDmut with WT samples, normalized to their input controls. Promoters or an enhancers annotations were performed with GenomicRanges ( Lawrence et al., 2013 46. Lawrence, M. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Pagès, H. ... Software for computing and annotating genomic ranges PLoS Comput. Biol. 2013; 9 :e1003118 Crossref Scopus (2368) PubMed Google Scholar ) and annotatr package ( Cavalcante and Sartor, 2017 11. Cavalcante, R.G. ∙ Sartor, M.A. annotatr: genomic regions in context Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2381-2383 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ).

The slides were rehydrated in series of ethanol solutions (100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 70% ethanol) and distilled water. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling slides for 20 min in a citrate-based antigen unmasking solution (Vector labs, H3300). After cooling down to room temperature, endogenous peroxidase activities were quenched by 1% H 2 O 2 in distilled water for 20 min. After three washes in TT buffer (500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Trizma, and 0.05% Tween-20), slides were blocked in 2% normal goat serum and 4% BSA in TT buffer for 1 h. Next, tissue slides were incubated with various primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After three washes in TT buffer, biotinylated secondary antibody was added onto these slides for 1 h, following by 1 h treatment of the Vectastain Elite ABC reagents (Vector Labs, PK-6100). After three TT washes, the slides were processed with DAB peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Labs, SK-4100), and hematoxylin solutions for immunohistochemistry staining, dehydrated in a standard ethanol/xylenes series, and mounted in 75% v/v Permount (Fischer Scientific, SP15-500) in xylenes.
