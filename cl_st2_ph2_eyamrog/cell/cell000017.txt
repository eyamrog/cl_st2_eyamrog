Title: Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons


Abstract: Summary

Teneurins are ancient metazoan cell adhesion receptors that control brain development and neuronal wiring in higher animals. The extracellular C terminus binds the adhesion GPCR Latrophilin, forming a trans -cellular complex with synaptogenic functions. However, Teneurins, Latrophilins, and FLRT proteins are also expressed during murine cortical cell migration at earlier developmental stages. Here, we present crystal structures of Teneurin-Latrophilin complexes that reveal how the lectin and olfactomedin domains of Latrophilin bind across a spiraling beta-barrel domain of Teneurin, the YD shell. We couple structure-based protein engineering to biophysical analysis, cell migration assays, and in utero electroporation experiments to probe the importance of the interaction in cortical neuron migration. We show that binding of Latrophilins to Teneurins and FLRTs directs the migration of neurons using a contact repulsion-dependent mechanism. The effect is observed with cell bodies and small neurites rather than their processes. The results exemplify how a structure-encoded synaptogenic protein complex is also used for repulsive cell guidance.

Section: Introduction

Teneurins are eukaryotic cell adhesion receptors that are thought to have evolved through a horizontal gene transfer event, where fusion of a bacterial toxin gene to a eukaryotic receptor resulted in a large type II transmembrane protein ( Tucker et al., 2012 90.

Evol. 2012; 29 :1019-1029 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). They have been described in worms, insects, vertebrates, and single-celled choanoflagellates ( Tucker et al., 2012 90. Tucker, R.P. ∙ Beckmann, J. ∙ Leachman, N.T. ... Phylogenetic analysis of the teneurins: conserved features and premetazoan ancestry Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29 :1019-1029 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). The four mammalian Teneurin homologs, Ten1 to Ten4, (also referred to as Ten-m1 to Ten-m4 and Odz-1 to Odz-4) are found predominantly, but not exclusively, in the nervous system, where they display complementary expression patterns from early development through to adulthood ( Li et al., 2006; Ben-Zur et al., 2000; Kenzelmann et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2003 8.

In humans, Teneurins are risk loci in bipolar disorder ( Croarkin et al., 2017; Green et al., 2013; Mühleisen et al., 2014; Psychiatric GWAS Consortium Bipolar Disorder Working Group, 2011 16.

A role for TENM1 mutations in congenital general anosmia Clin. Genet. 2016; 90 :211-219 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mammalian Teneurins are modular, ∼2,800-residue-long type II transmembrane proteins whose ∼250-kDa extracellular domain comprises at least 16 annotated domains ( Figure 1 A). We recently revealed the first X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy structures of an ∼200-kDa fraction of the Gallus gallus Ten2 and murine Ten3 extracellular domains. These revealed a conserved superfold of eight domains ( Jackson et al., 2018 42. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Meijer, D.H. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structures of Teneurin adhesion receptors reveal an ancient fold for cell-cell interaction Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1079 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). A similar cryoelectron microscopy structure of human Ten2 ( Li et al., 2018 52. Li, J. ∙ Shalev-Benami, M. ∙ Sando, R. ... Structural Basis for Teneurin Function in Circuit-Wiring: A Toxin Motif at the Synapse Cell. 2018; 173 :735-748.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) confirmed that key features of this fold are conserved. The structures revealed three signature motifs of the Teneurin fold: (1) the spiraling beta-barrel tyrosine-aspartate repeat “YD shell” domain, (2) a specialized “fibronectin plug” domain that seals off the YD shell at the N-terminal side, and (3) a beta-propeller referred to as the NCL-1, HT2A, and Lin-41 (NHL) domain. These three elements form a superfold that is widespread in bacterial genomes, suggesting that they represent an evolutionarily ancient uncharacterized family of secreted bacterial proteins ( Jackson et al., 2018 42. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Meijer, D.H. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structures of Teneurin adhesion receptors reveal an ancient fold for cell-cell interaction Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1079 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The YD shell bears structural similarity to bacterial toxins of the TcB-TcC family ( Busby et al., 2013; Gatsogiannis et al., 2013; Meusch et al., 2014 14. Busby, J.N. ∙ Panjikar, S. ∙ Landsberg, M.J. ...

Meusch, D. ∙ Gatsogiannis, C. ∙ Efremov, R.G. ... Mechanism of Tc toxin action revealed in molecular detail Nature. 2014; 508 :61-65 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). The regions upstream and downstream of the fibronectin (FN) plug, NHL, and YD shell are highly conserved in mammalian Teneurins. C-terminal of the YD shell is an ∼200-amino-acid linker that resides in the YD repeat shell and leads through the shell wall to form the antibiotic-binding-like (ABD) and Tox-GHH domains. The Tox-GHH harbors a colicin-like DNase fold ( Ferralli et al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2012 28. Ferralli, J. ∙ Tucker, R.P. ∙ Chiquet-Ehrismann, R.

Direct. 2012; 7 :18 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ) that includes a Teneurin C-terminal associated peptide, TCAP. This neuropeptide is either cleaved from the full Teneurin protein or transcribed separately and is thought to modulate murine stress behavior ( Woelfle et al., 2016 99. Woelfle, R. ∙ D’Aquila, A.L. ∙ Lovejoy, D.A. Teneurins, TCAP, and latrophilins: roles in the etiology of mood disorders Transl. Neurosci. 2016; 7 :17-23 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upstream of the Teneurin core fold lies the extracellular transthyretin (TTR)-like domain, a cysteine-rich region that is not structurally annotated, and eight epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, two of which form disulphide bridges and mediate Teneurin dimer formation, presumably “ in cis ” (between Teneurins on the same cell). An ∼180-amino-acid-long linker leads from the EGF domains to the transmembrane (TM) helix and intracellular domain (ICD).
Pioneering studies in flies, which have two Teneurins, Ten-a and Ten-m, revealed roles in synaptic matching in the olfactory system ( Hong et al., 2012 38. Hong, W. ∙ Mosca, T.J. ∙ Luo, L. Teneurins instruct synaptic partner matching in an olfactory map Nature. 2012; 484 :201-207 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) and at neuromuscular junctions ( Mosca et al., 2012 64.

Trans-synaptic Teneurin signalling in neuromuscular synapse organization and target choice Nature. 2012; 484 :237-241 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mice, Ten3 and Ten2 direct axonal wiring in the visual system ( Antinucci et al., 2013, 2016; Dharmaratne et al., 2012; Leamey et al., 2007 4. Antinucci, P. ∙ Nikolaou, N. ∙ Meyer, M.P. ...

Teneurins promote synapse development and trans -synaptic adhesion by also engaging in heterophilic interactions with Latrophilins ( Boucard et al., 2014; Sando et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2011 12. Boucard, A.A. ∙ Maxeiner, S. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing J. Biol.

Teneurin ectodomains that are proteolytically released from the cell surface bind to Latrophilins and act as attractants in axon guidance ( Vysokov et al., 2018 95.

Latrophilins (Lphn1–Lphn3 in mammals) are adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that have received attention because of their role as a calcium-independent receptor of latrotoxin ( Davletov et al., 1996; Krasnoperov et al., 1996; Lelianova et al., 1997 19.

FLRT proteins are endogenous latrophilin ligands and regulate excitatory synapse development Neuron. 2012; 73 :903-910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ) and engage in large supercomplexes that include Uncoordinated-5 (Unc5) receptors ( Jackson et al., 2015, 2016; Seiradake et al., 2016 40.

Seiradake, E. ∙ Jones, E.Y. ∙ Klein, R. Structural Perspectives on Axon Guidance Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 32 :577-608 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Latrophilins contain a short C-terminal ICD, a seven-TM GPCR domain (7TM), the extracellular GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing and hormone domains (GAIN/Horm), a glycosylated linker region (∼100 residues), and N-terminal olfactomedin (Olf) and lectin (Lec) domains ( Figure 1 A). FLRTs are single-spanning type I TM proteins with an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that is connected to a downstream FN-like domain via a glycosylated linker ( Figure 1 A). The LRR domain of FLRT binds the Latrophilin Olf domain ( Jackson et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015; Ranaivoson et al., 2015 40. Jackson, V.A. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ...

Boucard, A.A. ∙ Maxeiner, S. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :387-402 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). The linker between the Lec and Olf domains undergoes alternative splicing and determines the affinity of Latrophilin binding to Teneurin ( Boucard et al., 2014 12. Boucard, A.A. ∙ Maxeiner, S. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :387-402 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent work shows that FLRT3, Lphn2/3, and Ten2 work together as coincidence receptors in directing hippocampal synapse formation ( Sando et al., 2019 75. Sando, R. ∙ Jiang, X. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilin GPCRs direct synapse specificity by coincident binding of FLRTs and teneurins Science. 2019; 363 :eaav7969 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). How Teneurins and Latrophilins interact at the molecular level and whether Teneurin-Latrophilin interactions have functions in early neurodevelopment prior to wiring has remained unclear. Here we ask the following questions. What is the structural mechanism of the Teneurin-Latrophilin interaction? Is it compatible with the known FLRT-Latrophilin binding mechanism? What is the function of the synaptic proteins Teneurin, Latrophilin, and FLRT during early cortex development? With X-ray crystallography, we reveal the Latrophilin binding site on Teneurin at the lateral side of the YD shell domain. The Teneurin-Latrophilin binding mechanism we reveal is consistent with coincidence binding of FLRT to the Latrophilin Olf domain, and we suggest a ternary complex model using our previous structural data on the Latrophilin-FLRT interaction ( Jackson et al., 2016 41. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11184 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We use the structural results to probe for receptor functions in early cortical development and reveal a repulsion-mediated mechanism of cell body guidance. These results expand the functional repertoire of these receptors beyond a role in synapse development.

Section: Results

Previous studies have demonstrated that the Lec domain of Latrophilin is essential and sufficient for binding to Teneurin proteins ( Boucard et al., 2014 12. Boucard, A.A. ∙ Maxeiner, S. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :387-402 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We produced murine Latrophilin 2 (Lphn2 Lec domain, residues 30–137) and chicken Teneurin 2 (residues 1,043–2,802) individually in HEK293 cells and mixed the purified proteins. Crystals of Ten2 and Lphn2 grew in sitting drops at 4°C. We collected X-ray diffraction data up to 3.6-Å resolution and solved the structure by molecular replacement ( Figure 1 B; PDB: 6SKE ). Crystallographic details are summarized in Table S1 . The data reveal the Lphn2 Lec binding site on the Teneurin YD shell, spanning the tiers of the spiraling YD shell domain ( Figure 1 B) and burying a total of ∼1,500 Å 2 surface area. The Olf domain is thought to contribute to the binding between Teneurin and Latrophilin ( Boucard et al., 2014 12. Boucard, A.A. ∙ Maxeiner, S. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :387-402 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore also expressed murine Latrophilin 1 (Lphn1 Lec-Olf domains, residues 29–395) in HEK293 cells and produced complex crystals with Ten2 (residues 955–2802) in sitting drops at 18°C. We collected X-ray diffraction data up to 3.86-Å resolution and solved the structure by molecular replacement ( Figures 1 C and S1 A; PDB: 6SKA ). This second structure confirms the conserved Lec binding site on the Ten2 YD shell domain ( Figures 1 B, S1 B, and S1C). Most of the buried Teneurin surface is contacted by the Lec domain, which is consistent with previous reports showing that Lec is essential and sufficient for the interaction. The total buried surface in this complex is ∼2,500 Å 2 . In both structures, the C-terminal Tox-GHH/TCAP domain lies ∼6 nm away from the Latrophilin binding site ( Figures 1 D and 1E). FLRT is known to bind Latrophilin Olf via the concave surface of its LRR domain ( Jackson et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015 40. Jackson, V.A. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ...

Structural Basis of Latrophilin-FLRT-UNC5 Interaction in Cell Adhesion Structure. 2015; 23 :1678-1691 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Superposition of the previously solved Lphn3-FLRT2 complex structure ( Jackson et al., 2016 41. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11184 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) produces a model of how the three proteins likely interact in a ternary complex ( Figures 1 C and S1 D). Sequence conservation in the binding interfaces of vertebrate Latrophilins and Teneurins ( Figures S1 E and S1F) suggests that the interaction has conserved functional importance that restrains sequence diversion in this area.
We chose the minimal complex of Lphn2 Lec-Ten2 ( Figure 1 B) for a set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess the stability of the complex and to better define the positions of side chains in the interface. A 500-ns unrestrained simulation of the complex showed little movement between the Lec and YD shell (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD], ∼0.2 nm), suggestive of a stable complex ( Figure S1 G). In contrast, the NHL domain drifted from its original position at the YD shell (RMSD, ∼1.2 nm), suggesting that it is connected via a flexible hinge. The FN plug domain, ABD, and Tox-GHH domains were displaced by ∼0.3 nm RMSD. These results are consistent with previous cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies, which also suggested flexibility in these areas ( Jackson et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018 42. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Meijer, D.H. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structures of Teneurin adhesion receptors reveal an ancient fold for cell-cell interaction Nat.

Structural Basis for Teneurin Function in Circuit-Wiring: A Toxin Motif at the Synapse Cell. 2018; 173 :735-748.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also performed a 50-ns simulation in which the protein backbone atom positions were restrained to refine the positions of the side chains. The results suggested two binding hotspots within the interface; one of these contacts is centered around D55, located in the loop between Lphn2 Lec strands β2 and β3 ( Figures 1 F–1H, and S1 H). Analysis of the hydrogen bond pattern showed that D55 forms a stable salt bridge with R2197, located in the top tier of the Ten2 YD shell. A second contact is formed by the β1-β2 and β4-h1 loops of Lec, which are binding to the lower part of the Ten2 YD shell. Here, too, negatively charged residues (Lphn2 D68 and D73) bind a positive patch on Ten2 (R1893 and K1866) ( Figures 1 F, 1G, 1I, and S1 I). Analysis of the hydrogen bonding patterns within the 500-ns unrestrained simulation revealed a similar pattern of hydrogen bonds ( Figures S1 J–S1L).
We produced a panel of Teneurin, Latrophilin, and FLRT constructs ( Figures 2 A–2C) and performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cell-based binding experiments to validate our structural and simulation results. All relevant proteins were produced in mammalian HEK293 cells. We purified soluble ectodomains using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. TM constructs were tested for successful cell surface expression by immunostaining ( Figure S2 A; Jackson et al., 2015, 2016; Seiradake et al., 2014 40. Jackson, V.A. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structural basis of latrophilin-FLRT interaction Structure. 2015; 23 :774-781 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar 41.

FLRT structure: balancing repulsion and cell adhesion in cortical and vascular development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also created “non-binding” mutants using an established method of introducing N-linked glycosylation sites at amino acid positions that are centrally located in the binding site. We refer to these mutants as “non-Latrophilin-binding Teneurin” (Ten LT ) and “non-Teneurin-binding Latrophilin” (Lphn TL ), in analogy to our previously published FLRT LF mutants, the “non-Latrophilin-binding FLRT” proteins ( Jackson et al., 2015 40. Jackson, V.A. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structural basis of latrophilin-FLRT interaction Structure. 2015; 23 :774-781 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we produced a multiple-point mutant of Lphn1 that is based on our MD simulation results and does not depend on N-linked glycosylation: Lphn1 TL2 (L39A, P51G, D54A, D67A, and D72A). A cell-based binding assay ( Jackson et al., 2016 41. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11184 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which TM Teneurin or Latrophilin constructs are expressed on HEK293 cells and incubated with soluble Latrophilin or Teneurin ectodomains, showed that Ten2 LT , Lphn1 TL , and Lphn1 TL2 have indeed lost their ability to interact ( Figures 2 D–2F), validating the crystal structures. We also tested the mutants using SPR with consistent results ( Figure 2 G). The non-FLRT binding Lphn FL mutant still binds Teneurin ( Figure S2 B). To test the mutations in trans -cellular adhesion assays, we subjected them to a previously described cell aggregation assay where Teneurin-expressing cells adhere to Latrophilin-expressing cells ( Berns et al., 2018 10. Berns, D.S. ∙ DeNardo, L.A. ∙ Pederick, D.T. ... Teneurin-3 controls topographic circuit assembly in the hippocampus Nature. 2018; 554 :328-333 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that Ten2 LT and Lphn1 TL do not promote K-562 cell adhesion ( Figures 2 H and 2I). The specificity of the mutants is given by the single point mutations that were used to generate them, and so they are fully functional otherwise. For example, Lphn1 TL cannot bind Teneurin, but it maintains its FLRT-binding capabilities. Therefore, Lphn1 TL -expressing cells aggregate with FLRT2-expressing cells but not with Ten2-expressing cells ( Figures 2 H and 2I).
Our structural results suggest that a ternary complex of Teneurin-Latrophilin-FLRT could form via the described 1:1 binding surfaces of Lec-Ten2 and Olf-FLRT ( Figure 1 C). We tested the formation of such a ternary complex using SPR. Pre-mixed Latrophilin and Teneurin proteins produced an increased binding response to FLRT protein compared with Latrophilin alone. Ten2 binds all three Latrophilins (Lphn1–Lphn3; Figure S2 C) but, on its own, does not bind FLRT ( Figures 2 J, S2 D, and S2E). Therefore, this increase must be due to Teneurin interacting with FLRT via Latrophilin. A cell-based assay confirmed these binding results. We showed that Teneurin only binds to cell surface FLRT when wild-type Latrophilin is present and not when a non-binding Lphn mutant is used ( Figure 2 K). We also used a pull-down assay where cells expressing full-length FLRT and Teneurin were mixed with cells expressing full-length Latrophilin or with non-transfected control cells. Immunoprecipitation of Teneurin lead to efficient pull-down of FLRT when the cells were mixed with Latrophilin-expressing cells, but not when they were mixed with control cells ( Figures S2 F and S2G). These data confirm that the Latrophilin extracellular domain can bind both Teneurin and FLRT simultaneously in vitro . The findings are consistent with the coincident binding model of Latrophilin, Teneurin, and FLRT, proposed by others in synaptic development ( Sando et al., 2019 75. Sando, R. ∙ Jiang, X. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilin GPCRs direct synapse specificity by coincident binding of FLRTs and teneurins Science. 2019; 363 :eaav7969 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). A summary of the specific mutations we used here is given in Figure 2 L.
We previously showed that Latrophilin and FLRT proteins affect embryonic cortical neuron migration in vitro and in vivo ( Jackson et al., 2015, 2016; Seiradake et al., 2014; Del Toro et al., 2017; Yamagishi et al., 2011 20.

Teneurins are expressed widely across the brain during development, including in the cortex ( Kenzelmann et al., 2008; Rubin et al., 2002 45. Kenzelmann, D. ∙ Chiquet-Ehrismann, R. ∙ Leachman, N.T. ... Teneurin-1 is expressed in interconnected regions of the developing brain and is processed in vivo BMC Dev.

Teneurin 2 is expressed by the neurons of the thalamofugal visual system in situ and promotes homophilic cell-cell adhesion in vitro Development. 2002; 129 :4697-4705 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), where they could play a role in pathfinding ( Vysokov et al., 2018 95. Vysokov, N.V. ∙ Silva, J.-P. ∙ Lelianova, V.G. ... Proteolytically released Lasso/teneurin-2 induces axonal attraction by interacting with latrophilin-1 on axonal growth cones eLife. 2018; 7 :e37935 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we asked whether Latrophilin-Teneurin binding regulates embryonic cortical migration. In situ hybridization (ISH) for Latrophilins revealed that Lphn1 and 2 are expressed in neuron-enriched layers (cortical plate [CP] and intermediate zone [IZ]) and the apical progenitor (AP)-enriched layer (ventricular zone [VZ]), where radial glial (RG) cell bodies are located, from embryonic days 13.5 [E13.5] to E17.5 ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S3 A, S3B, S3D, and S3E). This finding is consistent with single-cell RNA profiling data from E14.5 mouse cortex ( Kawaguchi et al., 2008 44. Kawaguchi, A. ∙ Ikawa, T. ∙ Kasukawa, T. ... Single-cell gene profiling defines differential progenitor subclasses in mammalian neurogenesis Development. 2008; 135 :3113-3124 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) that also revealed expression of Lphn1 and Lphn2 in neurons and APs ( Figure 3 C). Combination of ISH with staining for the phosphorylated form of vimentin (Pvim), which labels dividing RGs, and the neuronal marker Ctip2 showed that Lphn1 and Lphn2 are expressed in neurons and RGs ( Figure 3 D). ISH for all four mouse Teneurins showed that these are predominantly expressed in neuron-enriched layers (CP and IZ) ( Figure 3 E; Figures S3 C and S3F). In agreement with these results, analysis using data from two RNA-seq databases showed that Ten2 and Ten4 are highly expressed in neurons compared with APs ( Figure 3 F; Kawaguchi et al., 2008 44. Kawaguchi, A. ∙ Ikawa, T. ∙ Kasukawa, T. ... Single-cell gene profiling defines differential progenitor subclasses in mammalian neurogenesis Development. 2008; 135 :3113-3124 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some Ten4 expression is also detected in RGs ( Figure S3 G; Florio et al., 2015 29. Florio, M. ∙ Albert, M. ∙ Taverna, E. ... Human-specific gene ARHGAP11B promotes basal progenitor amplification and neocortex expansion Science. 2015; 347 :1465-1470 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results were further confirmed by co-staining with the neuronal marker Ctip2 and the RG marker Pvim. Ten2 and Ten3 showed reduced staining in APs compared with neuron-enriched layers ( Figure 3 G).
Given that FLRTs are also enriched in neurons during cortical development ( Seiradake et al., 2014 80. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT structure: balancing repulsion and cell adhesion in cortical and vascular development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; del Toro et al., 2017 20. Del Toro, D. ∙ Ruff, T. ∙ Cederfjäll, E. ... Regulation of Cerebral Cortex Folding by Controlling Neuronal Migration via FLRT Adhesion Molecules Cell. 2017; 169 :621-635.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 H), we asked whether FLRTs and Teneurins are co-expressed in migrating cortical neurons. Single-cell RNA profiling analysis ( Kawaguchi et al., 2008 44. Kawaguchi, A. ∙ Ikawa, T. ∙ Kasukawa, T. ... Single-cell gene profiling defines differential progenitor subclasses in mammalian neurogenesis Development. 2008; 135 :3113-3124 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed a positive correlation between Ten2 and FLRT1/3 and Ten4 with FLRT2 in cortical neurons ( Figure S3 I). Co-expression of Ten2 and FLRT3 was strongest in migrating neurons compared with other cell types ( Figure S3 J). Surface staining for both Ten2 and FLRT3 revealed that both receptors are located in close proximity on the cell body and neurites/growth cones of cortical neurons. Addition of Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) protein induced more proximal localization of FLRT3 and Ten2 compared with addition of the Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) non-Teneurin and non-FLRT-binding (TL-FL) mutant protein. The mutant protein also bound less to cultured neurons compared with the wild type, and it co-localized less with Ten2 and FLRT3 staining ( Figures 3 H, 3I, and S3 K–S3M). Latrophilin expression in cis can moderate but does not abolish Teneurin or FLRT binding to externally presented Latrophilin ( Figures S3 N–S3P).
In agreement with these results, our crystallography, SPR, and cell-binding experiments suggest that Latrophilin, FLRT, and Teneurin physically interact ( Figures 1 and 2 ). Pull-down experiments using E15.5 mouse brain lysate show that Ten2 and Latrophilins co-immunoprecipitate with FLRT, suggesting that the three proteins also interact in vivo ( Figures 3 J, 3K, S3 Q, and S3R). Based on these results, we developed a working model in which migrating neurons co-expressing Lphns, Teneurins, and FLRTs interact with Lphns present in RG cells and/or other cortical neurons ( Figure 3 L). We proceeded with functional analysis to understand the roles of these proteins in early cortical development.
To study the effects of Latrophilin-Teneurin binding on cortical neuron migration, we performed time-lapse imaging of E15.5 embryonic cortical explants grown on Lphn1 (Lec-Olf)-coated dishes and measured the migration of neurons exiting the explant ( Figures 4 A and S4 A). Using automatic tracking ( Video S1 ), we found that cortical neurons migrated slower and shorter distances on Lphn1 (Lec-Olf)-coated surfaces compared with control surfaces ( Figures 4 B and S4 B). Similar effects were observed with the TL-FL Lec-Olf single mutants ( Figures S4 C and S4D; Video S1 ). In contrast, neurons migrating on the double-mutant protein (Lphn TL-FL Lec-Olf) behaved similarly as those on control protein.

After 30min incubation at 37°C, the dishes were washed three times with PBS and coated with 20μg/ml laminin for ∼2 hours at 37°C. Cortical explants from E15.5 mouse embryos were cultured in neurobasal, supplemented with B27 and 0.4% methylcellulose. After 4 hours in culture, the explants were imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a temperature-controlled carbon dioxide incubation chamber set to 37°C, 65% humidity and 5% CO 2 . Illumination was provided by an X-Cite lamp (series 120, Lumen Dynamics Group), and images were recorded by a Coolsnap HQ camera (Photometrics). Sequential images were acquired every 5 min.

Given that Lphn1 is highly expressed in RG cells, whereas its binding partners Teneurins and FLRTs are present in migrating neurons ( Figures 3 and S3 ), we addressed the complexity of Lphn1 function in the context of neuron-RG cell interactions. Cortical migration relies on a delicate balance between neuron-neuron and neuron-RG fiber interactions. Indeed, altering glial-guided neuronal migration affects neuronal dynamics and morphology as well as their tangential dispersion ( Valiente et al., 2011 92. Valiente, M. ∙ Ciceri, G. ∙ Rico, B. ... Focal adhesion kinase modulates radial glia-dependent neuronal migration through connexin-26 J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :11678-11691 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We chose arrays of parallel aligned nanofibers to mimic the fibrillary environment of RG cells ( Schnell et al., 2007; Vasita and Katti, 2006 77. Schnell, E. ∙ Klinkhammer, K. ∙ Balzer, S. ... Guidance of glial cell migration and axonal growth on electrospun nanofibers of poly-ε-caprolactone and a collagen/poly-ε-caprolactone blend Biomaterials. 2007; 28 :3012-3025 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 94. Vasita, R. ∙ Katti, D.S. Nanofibers and their applications in tissue engineering Int. J. Nanomedicine. 2006; 1 :15-30 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a source of neurons, we used cortical explants that, after being positioned onto nanofibers, displayed directed axon growth and cell migration along the fibers ( Figures 4 C and S4 E). Neurons exiting the explants displayed similar features as observed in vivo , such as transitioning from multipolar to bipolar morphology prior to migrating along nanofibers and transient branching of their leading process, as described recently ( Martínez-Martínez et al., 2019 57. Martínez-Martínez, M.Á. ∙ Ciceri, G. ∙ Espinós, A. ... Extensive branching of radially-migrating neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex J. Comp. Neurol. 2019; 527 :1558-1576 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 D; Video S2 ). Neurons occasionally switched between neighboring fibers ( Figure 4 E) but produced mostly linear paths, as observed in vivo ( Figure 4 F; Video S2 ). Using semi-automatic analysis ( Figure S4 E), we found that neurons migrated shorter distances on nanofibers coated with Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) compared with FC control protein ( Figures 4 G, 4H, and S4 F). Non-Teneurin (TL) and non-FLRT-binding (FL) Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) mutant proteins were equally effective in slowing neuron migration. The double mutant Lphn1 TL-FL (Lec-Olf) resulted in reduced effects on neuron migration compared with the wild-type protein, indicating that additive or coincident binding of Teneurins and FLRTs affects neuron migration. The fact that this mutant produces partial rescue of the migration effect suggests that other interactions may also play a role; e.g., a weak glycan interaction site has been reported on mLphn1 Lec, with K d values in the millimolar range ( Vakonakis et al., 2008 91. Vakonakis, I. ∙ Langenhan, T. ∙ Prömel, S. ... Solution structure and sugar-binding mechanism of mouse latrophilin-1 RBL: a 7TM receptor-attached lectin-like domain Structure. 2008; 16 :944-953 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mean axon length and the percentage of explants producing migration were similar under all conditions ( Figures 4 I, 4J, S4 F, and S4G). In summary, these results indicate that Lphn1 delays cortical cell migration by binding Teneurins and FLRTs while having no effect on their axon growth.

Time-Lapse Analysis of Electroporated Cortical Neurons Migrating on Nanofibers and Time-Lapse Analysis of Cortical Neurons Migrating on Nanofibers, Related to Figure 4 First movie: Time-lapse analysis of electroporated cortical neurons migrating on nanofibers. We electroporated mouse embryos at E13.5 with pCAG-Ires-GFP and peformed explant cultures from the cortex 2 days later (E15.5). Explants were cultured on 6-well plates containing aligned nanofibers (700nm width, Sigma) coated with 40μg/ml of FC (control protein) and 100μg/ml of poly-D-lysine overnight at 37°C.

The mechanism by which cell surface proteins decrease cell migration speed could be due to a change in the balance of adhesion versus repulsion. Modulating either can lead to a reduction of migration in other systems. For example, during Xenopus gastrulation, migrating cells alternate between attachment and detachment. Reducing contact repulsion, in that case mediated by ephrinB-EphB signaling, increases attachment and reduces cell motility ( Rohani et al., 2011 73. Rohani, N. ∙ Canty, L. ∙ Luu, O. ... EphrinB/EphB signaling controls embryonic germ layer separation by contact-induced cell detachment PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 :e1000597 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, increasing ephrinB-EphB repulsion induces cell detachment ( Wen and Winklbauer, 2017 96. Wen, J.W. ∙ Winklbauer, R. Ingression-type cell migration drives vegetal endoderm internalisation in the Xenopus gastrula eLife. 2017; 6 :e27190 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), also affecting migration. Using stripe assays, we had shown previously that Lphn3 (Lec-Olf) repelled embryonic cortical neurons ( Jackson et al., 2015 40. Jackson, V.A. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structural basis of latrophilin-FLRT interaction Structure. 2015; 23 :774-781 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we found that Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) is also mildly repulsive for cortical neurons ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S5 A). Similar to the nanofiber assay described above, using stripe assays, we find that non-Teneurin (TL) and non-FLRT-binding (FL) Lphn1 single mutants are also repulsive. The Lphn1 TL-FL double mutant produces no response compared with the control. Time-lapse imaging of dissociated cortical neurons and GFP electroporated neurons choosing between alternate stripes of Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) and the TL-FL mutant showed that cell bodies and small neurites prefer the mutant ( Figures 5 C and 5D; Videos S3 and S4 ). These data suggest that the Lphn1-induced repulsion from stripes is due to its interaction with Teneurins and FLRTs in trans . Lphn1 was not repulsive for cortical axons ( Figures 5 E, 5F, and S5 B), which is also in agreement with the nanofiber assay. Also, GFP electroporated axons were not repelled by Lphn1 in time-lapse experiments. The growth cones of these axons did not show a preference for the Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) wild type or the TL-FL mutant ( Figures 5 G and 5H; Video S4 ). In summary, these results suggest that Lphn1 is repulsive for migrating cortical cells through an interaction with Teneurins and FLRTs but not for their axons.

Time-Lapse Analysis of Dissociated Cortical Neurons on Lphn1 and Lphn1 TL-FL Stripes, Related to Figure 5 Upper left movie: Dissociated cortical neurons (E15.5) were plated on stripes. 50μg/ml of Lphn1 protein was mixed with Alexa594-conjugated anti-hFC antibody (Invitrogen) in PBS. Proteins were injected into matrices (90 μm width) and placed on 60 mm dishes (Knöll et al., 2007), resulting in red-fluorescent stripes. After 30 min incubation at 37°C, the dishes were washed with PBS and the matrices removed. The dishes were coated with 50 μg/ml of Lphn1 TL-FL protein mixed with anti-hFC for 30 min at 37°C, washed three times with PBS, and coated with 20 μg/ml laminin for ∼2 hours at 37°C. After 2 hours in culture, neurons were imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a temperature-controlled carbon dioxide incubation chamber set to 37°C, 65% humidity and 5% CO 2 . Illumination was provided by an X-Cite lamp (series 120, Lumen Dynamics Group), and images were recorded by a Coolsnap HQ camera (Photometrics). Sequential images were acquired every 7 min. The video shows dissociated cortical neurons forming clusters over time and being repelled from Lphn1-containing red stripes. The bottom left movie shows the tracks of individual cells (small gray circles) and also the formation of cell clusters (indicated by bigger circles), using analysis with Imaris v9 (Bitplane). The upper right movie shows the tracked cells and clusters on the stripes that were used in the quantification shown in the bottom right movie. The percentage of tracked neurons on Lphn1 (red) stripes shows that there is a reduction of neurons on these stripes over time.

To generate the stripe pattern, 50μg/ml of Lphn1 protein was mixed with Alexa594-conjugated anti-hFC antibody (Invitrogen) in PBS. Proteins were injected into matrices (90 μm width) and placed on 60 mm dishes (Knöll et al., 2007), resulting in red-fluorescent stripes.

The video shows GFP+ cortical axons exiting the explant. They display normal growth and extension when contacting Lphn1 stripes. In the same video, a cortical neuron exiting the explant is repelled when its small neurites interact with Lphn1 stripes.
Having established that Lphn1 binding of Teneurins and FLRTs is repulsive for migrating neurons in vitro , we next addressed their function in the developing cortex. Using in utero electroporation (IUE) at E15.5, we overexpressed full-length Ten2 plus GFP, the non-Latrophilin-binding Ten2 LT plus GFP, or GFP control in cortical cells and analyzed their distribution at E18.5 ( Figure 6 A). We confirmed overexpression of Ten2 and Ten2 LT in migrating neurons ( Figure 6 B) and their correct localization and ligand-binding abilities at the cell surface ( Figures S6 A–S6C). We found that Ten2 overexpression in cortical migrating neurons delayed their migration. This delay was not observed when overexpressing Ten2 LT ( Figures 6 C and 6D), suggesting a functional role of Teneurin-Latrophilin interaction. Similar results were obtained when targeting cortical neurons at earlier stages (E13.5) ( Figures S6 D and S6E), which is consistent with the early expression of these proteins ( Figures S3 A–S3C). We performed live imaging of embryonic cortex ex vivo to find out whether Ten2 overexpression affects cortical migration. For these experiments, brains were sliced and imaged 48 h after electroporation with Ten2/GFP or Ten2 LT /GFP and mCherry to also label control neurons. Tracking of migrating neurons revealed that Ten2-expressing neurons migrated slower and remained longer in the IZ compared with control neurons ( Figures 6 E–6G; Video S5 ). The effects on neuronal migration were more modest when overexpressing Ten2 LT mutant protein ( Figures 6 E–6G; Video S5 ). In a separate set of experiments, we knocked down endogenous Ten2 in E15.5 cortices by embedding small hairpin RNA (shRNA) target sequences into the pCAG-miR30 vector system ( Matsuda and Cepko, 2007 59. Matsuda, T. ∙ Cepko, C.L. Controlled expression of transgenes introduced by in vivo electroporation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :1027-1032 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 7 A–7C, S7 A, and S7B). Analysis at E18.5 showed reduced migration of these neurons ( Figures 7 D and 7E). Similar results were obtained when Ten2 expression was targeted by CRISPR using the pX458 system ( Ran et al., 2013 70. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (3446) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S7 C and S7D). We also expressed a secreted version of Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) to compete with its endogenous ligands at E15.5, and this produced a strong delay in neuronal migration. This effect was not observed when using the mutant (TL-FL) construct ( Figures 7 F, 7G, S7 E, and S7F). These results show that Latrophilin interactions are essential for cortical neuron migration in vivo ( Figure 7 H).

Section: Discussion

Teneurins are highly conserved, with chicken and murine Teneurin 2 sharing 93% and 99% sequence identity with human Teneurin 2, respectively. The structural mechanism of how Teneurin binds to Latrophilins has long remained enigmatic, and previously available knowledge was lacking detailed structural information. The data presented here demonstrate that the Latrophilin-binding site on Teneurin comprises separate adjacent binding motifs located across the tiers of the spiraling β-sheet of the YD shell. Superposition with the FLRT2 LRR, as found previously bound to Lphn3, gives a compact ternary model that still involves the Teneurin YD shell domain rather than other Teneurin domains. The interface between the two bottom tiers of the Teneurin YD shell is of structural interest because it enables passage of the internal linker through the YD shell and into the ABD. In the related bacterial TcB/TcC toxins ( Busby et al., 2013; Meusch et al., 2014 14. Busby, J.N. ∙ Panjikar, S. ∙ Landsberg, M.J. ... The BC component of ABC toxins is an RHS-repeat-containing protein encapsulation device Nature. 2013; 501 :547-550 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Meusch, D. ∙ Gatsogiannis, C. ∙ Efremov, R.G. ... Mechanism of Tc toxin action revealed in molecular detail Nature. 2014; 508 :61-65 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), the equivalent interface area between the tiers of the YD shell is formed by two separate subunits of the toxin protein ( Jackson et al., 2018 42. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Meijer, D.H. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structures of Teneurin adhesion receptors reveal an ancient fold for cell-cell interaction Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1079 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that they come together post-translationally in bacteria. Given its geometry, this area of Teneurin must undergo significant conformational changes during protein folding and, therefore, may be inherently mobile. Latrophilin binds across these tiers of the Teneurin YD shell like a clamp and appears to stabilize the fold of this structural module.
Previous studies have emphasized that the inclusion of an alternatively spliced loop in the Teneurin NHL loop regulates Teneurin interactions, with some reports suggesting that inclusion of the loop inhibits Latrophilin binding ( Li et al., 2018; Sando et al., 2019 52. Li, J. ∙ Shalev-Benami, M. ∙ Sando, R. ...

Sando, R. ∙ Jiang, X. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilin GPCRs direct synapse specificity by coincident binding of FLRTs and teneurins Science. 2019; 363 :eaav7969 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Others found that the presence of this loop does not affect Teneurin-Latrophilin binding but that it promotes homophilic interactions of Teneurin together with an alternatively spliced sequence in the Teneurin EGF domains ( Berns et al., 2018 10. Berns, D.S. ∙ DeNardo, L.A. ∙ Pederick, D.T. ... Teneurin-3 controls topographic circuit assembly in the hippocampus Nature. 2018; 554 :328-333 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our Teneurin constructs include the alternatively spliced loop in the NHL domain but not that in the EGF domains. In agreement with ( Berns et al., 2018 10. Berns, D.S. ∙ DeNardo, L.A. ∙ Pederick, D.T. ... Teneurin-3 controls topographic circuit assembly in the hippocampus Nature. 2018; 554 :328-333 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), the constructs do not promote homophilic interaction, and they bind Latrophilins. The crystallographic data explain these binding results; the NHL domain does not engage with Latrophilin directly. Using the new structural data, we revealed a molecular map of how Teneurin, Latrophilin, and FLRT termini interact in vitro and designed a toolkit of mutants that control the individual interactions formed by these receptors. These mutant tools are used to interrogate the functions of specific interactions in cellular and in vivo settings.
Teneurins have recently emerged as key regulators of synaptic wiring ( Berns et al., 2018; Dharmaratne et al., 2012; Glendining et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2012; Mosca and Luo, 2014; Mosca et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2011; Vysokov et al., 2018; Young et al., 2013 10.

This highly evolved function contrasts with the evolutionarily early origin of Teneurins in unicellular organisms that lack a nervous system ( Jackson et al., 2018; Tucker et al., 2012 42. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Meijer, D.H. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structures of Teneurin adhesion receptors reveal an ancient fold for cell-cell interaction Nat.

Phylogenetic analysis of the teneurins: conserved features and premetazoan ancestry Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29 :1019-1029 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). In these organisms, Teneurin-like proteins likely engage in other types of cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions. This is consistent with studies in worms, where Teneurin (Ten-1) is essential for gonad epithelialization and basement membrane integrity ( Trzebiatowska et al., 2008 89. Trzebiatowska, A. ∙ Topf, U. ∙ Sauder, U. ... Caenorhabditis elegans teneurin, ten-1 , is required for gonadal and pharyngeal basement membrane integrity and acts redundantly with integrin ina-1 and dystroglycan dgn-1 Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19 :3898-3908 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here we show that, in the mammalian nervous system, Teneurins play important roles at earlier time points, much before synapse development. They direct the migration of embryonic cortical neurons, possibly by regulating their interaction with the radial glia scaffold. Although Teneurins and FLRTs are mainly expressed in migrating neurons, Latrophilins are expressed in neurons and RG cells. Mechanistically, the migrating neuron co-expresses Teneurins and FLRTs, and these two proteins could therefore bind Latrophilins coincidently in trans on opposing RG cells or other neurons ( Figure 7 H). This configuration is similar to the one proposed for their synaptogenic function: Teneurins and FLRTs on the pre-synaptic side interact with Latrophilins in trans on the post-synaptic side ( Sando et al., 2019 75. Sando, R. ∙ Jiang, X. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilin GPCRs direct synapse specificity by coincident binding of FLRTs and teneurins Science. 2019; 363 :eaav7969 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other configurations are conceivable, and it is possible that different context-dependent complexes form transiently as the cells migrate through their complex environment. Cell type-specific manipulation of expression of Teneurins, FLRTs, and Latrophilins will be needed to unravel the most important configurations for cortical neuron migration in vivo . Given that the formation of synapses is an adhesive/attractive process, we were surprised to find that the interaction between Teneurins, FLRTs, and Latrophilins during cell migration is repulsive. The delay in cell migration induced by overexpression of Teneurin could be caused by loss of traction rather than an increase in adhesion. Such a dual role in repulsive cell guidance and synaptogenesis is not without precedent. Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular (Eph) receptor/ephrin signaling has long been reported to mediate these processes ( Henderson and Dalva, 2018; Kania and Klein, 2016 35. Henderson, N.T. ∙ Dalva, M.B. EphBs and ephrin-Bs: Trans-synaptic organizers of synapse development and function Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2018; 91 :108-121 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Kania, A. ∙ Klein, R. Mechanisms of ephrin-Eph signalling in development, physiology and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 :240-256 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ), but despite intense research, the underlying signaling mechanisms that convert repulsion into synapse formation are poorly understood. Previous studies have identified different molecules promoting adhesion of migrating neurons to RG fibers such as connexin26/43 ( Elias et al., 2007 25. Elias, L.A.B. ∙ Wang, D.D. ∙ Kriegstein, A.R. Gap junction adhesion is necessary for radial migration in the neocortex Nature. 2007; 448 :901-907 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) ( Valiente et al., 2011 92. Valiente, M. ∙ Ciceri, G. ∙ Rico, B. ... Focal adhesion kinase modulates radial glia-dependent neuronal migration through connexin-26 J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :11678-11691 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), and N-cadherin ( Shikanai et al., 2011 83. Shikanai, M. ∙ Nakajima, K. ∙ Kawauchi, T. N-cadherin regulates radial glial fiber-dependent migration of cortical locomoting neurons Commun. Integr. Biol. 2011; 4 :326-330 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the molecules that mediate repulsion between neurons and RG fibers remain largely unknown.
Given that the synaptogenic functions of Teneurins and FLRTs require their localization on the pre-synaptic side, we were surprised to see that cortical axons showed no response toward Latrophilins. The easiest explanation would have been that, during the migratory phase, Teneurins and FLRTs are excluded from the axonal compartment and that these proteins are induced in axon terminals during synaptogenesis. However, we find that Ten2 and FLRT3 are co-expressed and show uniform distribution on the cell surface during the migration phase. These results suggest that the differential responses—i.e., repulsion of somata and small neurites and adhesion of axon terminals—are the result of differences in the downstream signaling pathways between the somatodendritic and axonal compartments. Similar results have been shown for Semaphorin 3A, which is attractive for cortical dendrites but repulsive for axons because of asymmetrically localized guanylate cyclase ( Polleux et al., 2000 68. Polleux, F. ∙ Morrow, T. ∙ Ghosh, A. Semaphorin 3A is a chemoattractant for cortical apical dendrites Nature. 2000; 404 :567-573 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar ). The highly polarized structure of migrating neurons could also contribute to the different response between its dendrites and axons. The leading process of migrating neurons seems to preferentially mediate the interactions toward RG fibers ( Elias et al., 2007 25. Elias, L.A.B. ∙ Wang, D.D. ∙ Kriegstein, A.R. Gap junction adhesion is necessary for radial migration in the neocortex Nature. 2007; 448 :901-907 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ). These increased contacts induce polarization of downstream signaling molecules, such as RhoA, being recruited to the leading process and Rac1 to the opposed neurite that will become the axon ( Xu et al., 2015 100. Xu, C. ∙ Funahashi, Y. ∙ Watanabe, T. ... Radial Glial Cell-Neuron Interaction Directs Axon Formation at the Opposite Side of the Neuron from the Contact Site J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :14517-14532 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In vivo , overexpression and knockdown of Ten2 in cortical neurons delayed their migration toward the CP, and this effect was not observed when overexpressing the Ten2 mutant defective in Lphn binding. The impairing effect of tampering with the Ten2 levels on migrating neurons is reminiscent of other receptors regulating cell migration, such as Neuroligin 2 ( Heng et al., 2008 36. Heng, J.I.-T. ∙ Nguyen, L. ∙ Castro, D.S. ... Neurogenin 2 controls cortical neuron migration through regulation of Rnd2 Nature. 2008; 455 :114-118 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). FLRT loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments also resulted in abnormal migration of cortical neurons ( Seiradake et al., 2014 80. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT structure: balancing repulsion and cell adhesion in cortical and vascular development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). The need for finely balanced levels of Ten2 in migrating neurons is a likely reason why attempts at loss-of-function rescue experiments, in which we tried to simultaneously knock down endogenous Ten2 and overexpress a resistant version by IUE, failed. It is likely that the levels of resistant Ten2 overexpressed in these neurons is high, more similar to our overexpression experiments than the correct endogenous levels. We complement our loss-of-function results with a separate in vivo assay where we overexpressed the secreted portion of the Latrophilin ectodomain that interacts with FLRTs and Teneurins (Lec-Olf) to effectively compete with the interactions of endogenous Lphn with its binding partners and delay cell migration. Regarding the downstream signaling pathways that mediate repulsion, very little is known. We have shown previously that Lphn-FLRT and FLRT-Unc5 interactions can trigger repulsive responses in cortical neurons in vitro ( Jackson et al., 2015; Yamagishi et al., 2011 40. Jackson, V.A. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structural basis of latrophilin-FLRT interaction Structure. 2015; 23 :774-781 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar 101.

In future work, it would be interesting to assess the possible role of Unc5 receptors in the context of a Teneurin-FLRT-Latrophilin complex. Unc5 are classic repulsive cell guidance receptors and form supercomplexes with Latrophilins and FLRTs ( Jackson et al., 2016 41. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11184 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recruitment of Unc5 to a Teneurin-FLRT-Latrophilin complex may enhance repulsive signaling.
In conclusion, our crystal structures revealed the main binding site for Latrophilin on the Teneurin YD shell domain. Latrophilin-Teneurin and Latrophilin-FLRT interactions give rise to a ternary complex and can be controlled by specific mutations in the Lec and Olf domains, respectively. Latrophilin binding of Teneurins and FLRTs, previously shown to engage neurons in synapse formation, slows down the migration of embryonic cortical neurons by contact repulsion. In our paradigm, the repulsive response involves the somatodendritic compartment of neurons without affecting their axon growth and extension, which are initiated concomitantly with migration. Teneurins and Latrophilins show broad expression during brain development, and so the reported mechanism could also be involved in controlling neuronal migration in other brain regions.

All mice (C75BL/6 background) were housed with 12:12h light/dark cycle and food/water available ad libitum . All experimental procedures involving mice were conducted in accordance with regulations set by the government of Upper Bavaria (License number 55.2-1-54-2532-57-2015). All histological experiments were carried out between E15.5 and E18.5.
Cortical explants from E15.5 embryos were dissected out and placed on 60-mm dishes or nanofibers. Coating was performed using 50 μg/ml of FC or Lphn1 proteins and 20 μg/ml of laminin (surface experiments) or 40 μg/ml of FC or Lphn1 proteins with 100 μg/ml poly-D-lysine and 20 μg/ml of laminin (nanofibers). Neurons were dissociated from cortices of E15.5 embryos and cultured on stripes (same coating as explants) or coverslips coated with 0.5mg/ml Poly-D-Lysine in 24 well-plates. Explants and neurons were cultured for 1-3 days in vitro at 37°C, 5% CO 2 in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. Samples were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde for 10 min and processed for immunostaining.
HEK293T cells (ATCC, cat# CRL-3216) and HEK293S cells (ATCC, cat#CRL-3022) used in this study were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% NEAA and 1% L-Glutamine at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . K-562 cells (ATCC, cat# CCL-243) used in this study were cultured in phenol red-free Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium, IMDM, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% NEAA and 1% L-Glutamine at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Protein expression was induced by transfection with plasmid DNA and polyethylenimine as the transfection reagent.
The constructs used in this study ( Figures 2 A–2C) were cloned into pHLSec ( Aricescu et al., 2006 6. Aricescu, A.R. ∙ Lu, W. ∙ Jones, E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :1243-1250 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ) or pCAGIG (Addgene, 11159) variant vectors with relevant tags for expression in cell lines or neurons, respectively. For protein purification, we used pHLSec vectors which also code for a C-terminal 6xHis-tag, for SPR we used a C-terminal Avi-tag, and for visualization on HEK or K-562 cells we used pHLSec variants that add an intracellular mVenus, mRuby, and/or an extracellular Flag, Myc and/or HA tag as indicated. For cloning of Ten2 LT (1892N+K1894T) we used forward and reverse primers, ctacgatgataaccgcacattcaccctgaggata and cagctgatcgtaaattatcctcagggtgaatgtgcggttatcatcgtag, respectively. For cloning of Lphn1 TL (E39N) we used forward and reverse primers, ctatcctgtgagggttattctatagacc and accctcacaggatagatttcgtctaac, respectively. For cloning of Lphn1 TL2 (L39A, P51G, D54A, D67A, D72A) we used forward and reverse primers, gccgaccctttccagatggagaatgtgcagtgctacttgcctgacgc and ctggaaagggtcggcagcgcagatcttgtcagctgtgcg, respectively. We also used constructs that were from previous papers, Lphn1 FL ( Jackson et al., 2015 40. Jackson, V.A. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ... Structural basis of latrophilin-FLRT interaction Structure. 2015; 23 :774-781 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) and FLRT LF ( Seiradake et al., 2014 80. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT structure: balancing repulsion and cell adhesion in cortical and vascular development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In detail, the forward and reverse primers that were used for cloning Lphn1 FL (R292N+R294T) were cctgttcttcaacaaagagaataccacaaacatcgtgaagttcgacctgc and gcaggtcgaacttcacgatgtttgtggtattctctttgttgaagaacagg, respectively.

Unless indicated otherwise, all purified proteins were expressed in adherent HEK293 cells following established procedures ( Seiradake et al., 2015 81. Seiradake, E. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Lu, W. ... Production of cell surface and secreted glycoproteins in mammalian cells Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1261 :115-127 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). More specifically, for each protein preparation, three liters of HEK cell culture were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM (Life Technologies, cat#21969035), supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies, cat# 10270-106), 1% NEAA (Life Technologies, cat# 11140035) and 1% L-Glutamine (Life Technologies, cat#25030-024) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . K-562 cells (ATCC, cat# CCL-243). Prior to transfection, the FBS content was reduced to 2%. The cells were transfected with 6 mg of purified plasmid DNA, previously mixed in a 1:2 (mass) ratio of DNA: polyethyleneimine (cat# 208727, Sigma Aldrich) as transfection reagent. The medium was harvested 5-10 days later, buffer-exchanged to 1x PBS (Sigma) supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5. The proteins were purified by loading onto a 5ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). The column was then washed with 30 column volumes of buffer containing 40 mM imidazole, and the protein eluted using buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The proteins were then purified using a Superdex200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) using buffers containing 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5. The proteins used for crystallization were expressed under conditions that reduce glycan heterogeneity. Ten2 and Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells in the presence of kifunensine, and Lphn2 Lec was expressed in HEK293S GlnTI - cells ( Reeves et al., 2002; Seiradake et al., 2015 72.

Production of cell surface and secreted glycoproteins in mammalian cells Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1261 :115-127 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to crystallization, the relevant proteins were mixed together in a 1:1 molar ratio, both complexes were concentrated to 4.9 mg/ml and mixed in 1:1 volume ratio with crystallization solution. The Ten2 and Lphn2 Lec complex was mixed with 0.1 M calcium acetate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 10% (w/v) PEG 4000, and crystals grew in sitting drops at 4°C before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol. The Ten2 and Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) complex was mixed with 0.1 M potassium chloride, 0.1M HEPES pH7.5, 15% (w/v) PEG6000, and crystals grew in sitting drops at 18°C before flash freezing in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol.
We performed the X-ray diffraction data collection at the Diamond Light Source beamline I03, in each case from a single crystal at 100 K. Data from the Ten2-Lphn2 complex crystals were integrated data up to 3.6 Å resolution using xia2 ( Winter et al., 2013 98. Winter, G. ∙ Lobley, C.M.C. ∙ Prince, S.M. Decision making in xia2 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2013; 69 :1260-1273 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ) and we solved the structure by molecular replacement using phaser ( McCoy et al., 2007 60. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (11032) PubMed Google Scholar ) with mouse Lphn3 Lec (PDB ID 5AFB ; Jackson et al., 2015 40. Jackson, V.A. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ...

Commun. 2018; 9 :1079 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) as inputs. We placed two copies of each Teneurin and Latrophilin in the asymmetric unit of the P1 cell. After placing Lphn3 Lec, we substituted this with a mouse Lphn2 Lec domain homology model, generated by SWISS-MODEL ( Bordoli et al., 2009 11. Bordoli, L. ∙ Kiefer, F. ∙ Arnold, K. ... Protein structure homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL workspace Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :1-13 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glycans and selected solvent atoms that were present in the high-resolution molecular replacement models were included as appropriate. Given the higher resolution data used to refine the input models of our molecular replacement job, we targeted the model to these structures during refinement. We also used automatic non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, and TLS refinement. Data for the Ten2-Lphn1 complex was integrated to 4 Å resolution using xia2 ( Winter et al., 2013 98.

Validation of the models was performed in molprobity ( Davis et al., 2007 18. Davis, I.W. ∙ Leaver-Fay, A. ∙ Chen, V.B. ... MolProbity: all-atom contacts and structure validation for proteins and nucleic acids Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :W375-83 Crossref Scopus (2630) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Crystallographic details are summarized in Table S1 .
We followed the same protocol as previously described to refine the interaction surfaces of X-ray crystallography-derived complexes ( Jackson et al., 2016 41.

Berendsen, H.J.C. ∙ Grigera, J.R. ∙ Straatsma, T.P. The missing term in effective pair potentials J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91 :6269-6271 Crossref Google Scholar ). Na and Cl ions were added up to 150 mM. Energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent algorithm and each system was equilibrated with a constant temperature (canonical ensemble, NVT, 310 K) ensemble for 100 picoseconds (ps), followed by a 100 ps equilibration at constant pressure (isothermal- isobaric, NPT, 1 bar). For equilibration and production runs, we applied the velocity-rescaling thermostat ( Bussi et al., 2007 15. Bussi, G. ∙ Donadio, D. ∙ Parrinello, M. Canonical sampling through velocity rescaling J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126 :014101 Crossref Scopus (5190) PubMed Google Scholar ) on protein and solvent, coupled with the Parrinello–Rahman barostat ( Parrinello and Rahman, 1981 67. Parrinello, M. ∙ Rahman, A. Polymorphic transitions in single crystals: A new molecular dynamics method J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 52 :7182 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), with a time constant of 2.0 ps and compressibility of 4.5x10 −5 bar -1 . Long-range electrostatics were modeled using the Particle-Mesh Ewald method ( Darden et al., 1993; Essmann et al., 1995 17. Darden, T. ∙ York, D. ∙ Pedersen, L.

A smooth particle mesh Ewald method J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103 :8577-8593 Crossref Google Scholar ). All bonds were treated using the LINCS algorithm ( Hess, 2007 37. Hess, B. P-LINCS: A Parallel Linear Constraint Solver for Molecular Simulation J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2007; 4 :116-122 Crossref Scopus (1422) Google Scholar ). The integration time step was 2 femtoseconds. We performed two different simulations: (i) 500 ns of unrestrained simulation to assess the stability of the Ten2-Lphn2 Lec complex; and (ii) 50 ns semi-restrained simulation. For the latter, the Teneurin backbone was constrained and we applied distance restraints on the Latrophilin backbone. By doing this we allowed Latrophilin to move with respect to Teneurin while keeping the backbone of both proteins in the configuration determined by X-ray crystallography. Side chains were allowed to move freely in this simulation. The restrained simulation was used to analyze H-bonds formed at the protein interfaces throughout the last 40 ns of simulation using the MDAnanlysis library ( Michaud-Agrawal et al., 2011 62. Michaud-Agrawal, N. ∙ Denning, E.J. ∙ Woolf, T.B. ... MDAnalysis: a toolkit for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations J. Comput. Chem. 2011; 32 :2319-2327 Crossref Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ) (relevant Jupyter Notebook and tcl script available at: https://github.com/MChavent/Hbond-analysis ). We used a donor-acceptor distance cut-off of 3.0 Å and a cut-off angle of 120°. The stability was defined as correlating with the percentage of the simulated time in which an atom forms the H-bond with its partner
Equilibrium binding experiments were performed at 25°C using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare) using PBS + 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20 (pH 7.5) as running buffer. The regeneration buffer was 2 M MgCl 2 . Latrophilin constructs were biotinylated enzymatically at a C-terminal Avi-Tag and coupled to a streptavidin-coated CM5 chip (GE healthcare, cat# 29104988). Data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software (Biacore, GE Healthcare). Indicative K D and R max values were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting of a 1:1 Langmuir interaction model (bound = R max /(K D +C), where C is analyte concentration calculated as monomer ( Table S2 ).
HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with transmembrane constructs of Teneurin or Latrophilin that were fused to an intracellular mVenus-tag and an extracellular HA, Flag or Myc tag. Depending on the tag included, anti-HA (SIGMA-Aldrich, Cat No. H3663), ant-Flag (SIGMA-Aldrich, Cat No. F1804) or anti-Myc (Abcam, Cat No. ab19233) were added to the cells at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Cells were incubated for 1 hour on ice and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, Lonza). Cells were fixed in 4% PFA (20min, on ice), immunostained with Cy3-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Abcam, Cat No. ab97035) or anti-chicken A568 antibody (Abcam, Cat No. ab175711) and mounted. Non-transfected cells acted as negative control.
HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the same constructs described above. His-tagged purified proteins were pre-clustered with 6x-His Tag antibody (Life Technologies, Cat No. 372900) for 1hr on ice and were added to the cells at a concentration of 5 or 10 μg/ml, for purified Lphn or Ten2 ectodomain samples, respectively. Cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% PFA (20min, on ice), immunostained with Cy3-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Abcam, Cat No. ab97035) or anti-chicken A568 antibody (Abcam, Cat No. ab175711) and mounted. Images were analyzed using ImageJ. For each image, the integrated density (the sum of the values of the pixels in the image) corresponding to bound protein was quantified (red) and divided by the integrated density corresponding to mVenus overexpression (green).
In case of experiments where HEK293 expressing FLRT3 were incubated with purified Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) or Ten2 ectodomain. HEK293 cells were transfected with a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing full-length mouse FLRT3 with a C-terminal FLAG-tag. 100 nM Ten2 or Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) were pre-clustered with 50 nM Anti-6XHis-tag FITC (Abcam, ab3554) or Anti-6XHis-tag DyLight 650 (Abcam, ab117504) antibodies for 1hr at room temperature and were added to the cells simultaneously. Following an incubation for 20 min at room temperature, cells were washed with PBS. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton (CarlRoth) and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and immunostained for FLRT3 overexpression with an anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000, Sigma, F9291).
K-562 cells were cultured according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium without phenol red supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were transfected with pHLSec plasmids coding for Teneurin (N-terminal mVenus) or Lphn (C-terminal mRuby) as indicated, using Lipofectamine LTX with PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, 15338100). 24 hours after transfection, the two population of cells were mixed in 24-well plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 and 250 rpm for ∼30 min.
50 μg/ml His-tagged protein was mixed with 120 μg/ml Cy3-conjugated αFc (Life Technologies A11014) in PBS. Matrices (90 μm width) ( Knöll et al., 2007 46. Knöll, B. ∙ Weinl, C. ∙ Nordheim, A. ... Stripe assay to examine axonal guidance and cell migration Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :1216-1224 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) were placed on 60 mm dishes and proteins injected. After 30 min incubation at 37°C, dishes were washed with PBS and matrices removed. Dishes were coated with 50 μg/ml Fc protein mixed with 120 μg/ml anti-hFc (Jackson ImmunoResearch 109-005-098) for 30 min at 37°C and washed with PBS. Stripes were further coated with 20 μg/ml Laminin in PBS for at least 2 hours and washed with PBS. Cortical neurons (E15.5) or explants (E15.5) were cultured on the stripes in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and, in case of explants, 0.4% methyl-cellulose (Sigma). After 24 (neurons) or 48 (explants) hours and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Neurons and explants were washed and incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-beta-III tubulin antibody (Sigma) after 20 min permeabilization in 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Cy2 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat#111-225-144) was used to visualize the tubulin signal. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before mounting. The numbers of beta-III-tubulin+ or DAPI+ pixels on red or black stripes were quantified using ImageJ (version 1.51p) ( Schneider et al., 2012 76. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (19355) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In utero electroporation (IUE) was performed at E13.5 or E15.5 on anesthetized C57BL/6 mice, as decribed below. DNA plasmids were used at 2 μg/μl and mixed with 1% fast green (Sigma, final concentration 0.2%). Knockdown of Ten2 by shRNA used the following sequences embedded in pCAG-miR30 plasmid: shRNA1: CTCCCTGTACGTTCTGGAGAAC, shRNA2: TTCACATACAGCGCTGACAATG. CRISPR sequences embedded in pX458 plasmids were: CRISPR#1: AGCTCCTGCGCCCAACGACC CRISPR#2: AACAGTAACCACTTCGGTGT. Scrambled sequence as control was: GCTCGCACACTAGCCGCCAC. Plasmids were injected into the ventricle with a pump controlled micropipette. After injection, six 50 ms electric pulses were generated with electrodes confronting the uterus above the ventricle. The abdominal wall and skin were sewn and the mice were kept until the desired embryonic stage. The pCAG-miR30 plasmids were validated in HEK293T cells, by co-transfection with mouse Ten2 (ecto) construct or chicken Ten2 (ecto), which acted as a non-sensitive control. The expression of Ten2 was analyzed by western blotting, using mouse anti-His antibody (QIAGEN, 34660). Secreted versions of Lphn1(Lec-Olf) and Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) TL-FL used in IUE experiments were cloned into the pCAGIG vector, and encoded with a C-terminal Myc tag. The expression of these constructs were validated by expression in HEK293T cells and analyzed on western blots using chicken anti-Myc antibody (Abcam, ab19233).
Embryos were electroporated at E15.5 as described above using pCAG-mCherry (control neurons) together with pCAG-Ten2-IRES-GFP or pCAG-Ten2LT-IRES-GFP. After 48 hs, embryonic brains were dissected in ice cold sterile filtered and aerated (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) dissection medium (15.6 g/l DMEM/F12 (Sigma); 1.2 g/l NaHCO3; 2.9 g/l glucose (Sigma); 1% (v/v) penicillin streptomycin (GIBCO, cat#15140148)). Brains were embedded in 4% low melting agarose (Biozym, cat#840101) and cut into 300μm thick sections using a vibratome (Leica, VT1200S). Sections were suspended in a collagen mix (64% (v/v) cell matrix type I-A, Nitta Gelatin; 24% (v/v) 5 x DMEM/F12; 12% (v/v) reconstitution buffer (200mM HEPES; 50mM NaOH; 260mM NaHCO 3 ) and transferred onto a cell culture insert (Millicell; PICMORG50). Sections were incubated for 10 min at 37°C to solidify collagen. 1.5 mL slice medium (88% (v/v) dissection medium; 5% (v/v) horse serum; 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum; 2% (v/v) B27 supplement (GIBCO, cat#17504044); 1% (v/v) N-2 supplement (GIBCO, cat#17502001)) was added into the dish surrounding the culture insert and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Before start of time-lapse experiment, culture medium was added on top of the sections to allow objective immersion. Sections were imaged using a 20x water immersion objective on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope system equipped with a temperature-controlled carbon dioxide incubation chamber set to 37°C, 95% humidity and 5% CO 2 . Sequential images were acquired every 20 min for 14-60 hr. Single cell movement was tracked using the Fiji plugin “Manual Tracking.” Single cell track analysis and plotting was carried out using homemade python scripts.
Fresh E15.5 mouse cortices were homogenized for 1min at 4°C with an electric homogenizer using the following lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Roche ref. 04693116001). Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. Supernatant was collected and protein was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Biorad, 5000001). 1 mg of protein at a final concentration of 2 μg/μl in lysis buffer (volume: 500 μl) was used for each pull-down. Control pull-down contained lysate and 2 μg of goat anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, 109-005-098) while FLRT3 pull-down used 2 μg of goat anti-human FLRT3 antibody (R&D, AF2795). Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C under rotatory agitation. The next day, 10 μg of Sepharose beads were added to each sample (Amersham CL-4B, 17-01780-01, 50% v/v in lysis buffer) and incubated for 4 hours under rotatory agitation. Sepharose beads were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm and washed three times (first wash with 400 μl of lysis buffer, second wash with 1:1 (v/v) lysis buffer:PBS, last wash only PBS). Pulled-down samples were processed for mass spectrometry (MaxQuant run, Proteomic facility, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) or standard western blot. For western blotting, samples were run on 6% SDS gels, transferred to PVDF membranes and blotted for Ten2 (Novus Biologicals, rabbit, NBP2-55763) or FLRT3 (R&D, AF2795). For mVenus-tagged Ten2 pull-downs, adherent HEK293-T cells were transfected for 24 hours, with 0.5 μg pHLSec DNA coding for murine FLRT2 (Flag tagged) and 3 μg of pHLSec DNA coding for chicken Ten2 (mVenus tagged), per 2 mL of cell culture. Separately, cells were transfected with 3 μg of murine Lphn3, per 2 mL cell culture. 4 mL of each cell was used per experiment. Next day, cells transfected with Lphn3 were washed with PBS and incubated at 37°C with PBS supplemented with 1mM EDTA for 5min. The PBS/EDTA solution was then removed and cells were resuspended in 1ml DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, and pelleted at 100 x g for 4 min. Equal volumes of Lphn3-cells were added to adherent cells transfected with Ten2/FLRT2 and incubated at 37°C for 1hr. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH7.5, 150mM NaCl and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Cells were disrupted by mechanical force, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and expression control samples were taken at this point. The lysate was incubated with 2 μg/ml of rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Life Technologies, A11122) at 4°C for 1 hour under rotary agitation. 45 μl of a 50% suspension of pre-blocked Protein-G Sepharose 4 FF (Sigma, cat#P3296) was added per 1 mL of lysate, and incubated for 2 hours. After incubation, Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer, once with 1:1 ice-cold lysis buffer:PBS, once with ice-cold PBS, then resuspended in PBS and added with SDS-loading buffer. FLRT protein was detected using anti-Flag (Sigma, F1804) on a western blot. Band intensities were analyzed using ImageJ (Fiji) and normalized within each blot.
6 well-plate parallel nanofibers (700nm width, Sigma, Z759333-1EA) were coated with 40 μg/ml of specified protein (FC, Lphn1(Lec-Olf) and its mutant versions) and 100 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma) in PBS overnight (37°C, 65% humidity and 5% CO2). Next day, plates were washed with PBS and coated with 20 μg/ml laminin in PBS overnight. The next day, plates were washed with PBS and 36 cortical explants (E15.5) were placed per well (6x6 grid, see Figure S5 E) and cultured for 2 days in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.4% methyl-cellulose (Sigma). Then the explants were fixed with 4% PFA for 20min, washed with PBS and incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-beta-III tubulin antibody (Sigma) after 20 min of permeabilization in 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Cy2 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat#111-225-144) was used to visualize the tubulin signal. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before mounting. Mosaic images of each well were taken with SP8 (Leica) microscope. Analysis of the distance covered by cells labeled with DAPI and axons labeled with beta-III-tubulin was done in a semi-automatic mode using a custom ImageJ macro.
To perform the time-lapse analysis of cortical neurons migrating on surfaces coated with FC (control), murine Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) or Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) TL-FL , cortical explants from E15.5 mouse embryos were cultured on 60-mm dishes that were coated for 30 min with 50 μg/ml of each protein in PBS. After 30 min, the dish was washed with PBS and coated with 20 μg/ml Laminin in PBS for at least 2 hours. The dish was next washed with PBS and cortical explants (E15.5) were cultured. After 2 hours in culture, samples were imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a temperature-controlled carbon dioxide incubation chamber set to 37°C, 65% humidity and 5% CO 2 . Illumination was provided by an X-Cite lamp (series 120, Lumen Dynamics Group), and images were recorded by a Coolsnap HQ camera (Photometrics). Sequential images were acquired every 10 min. Analysis and tracking of all the neurons exiting the explant was carried out in Imaris (Bitplane) using the automatic tracking module.
For time-lapse analysis of GFP+ neurons and axons challenged with alternate Lphn1(Lec-Olf) or Lphn1 (Lec-Olf) TL-FL stripes, E13.5 mouse embryos were electroporated with PCAGIG plasmid and cortical explants (E15.5) were placed on stripes as described above. After 2 hours in culture, cortical explants were imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a temperature-controlled incubation chamber as described above. Sequential images were acquired every 10 min. Analysis was carried out using ImageJ, all contact events taking place in less than 2 frames were considered as repulsive events.
Time-lapse experiments of GFP+ neurons on nanofibers started after 2 hours of culturing E15.5 cortical explants, that had previously been electroporated at E13.5. Samples were imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a temperature-controlled incubation chamber as described above. Sequential images were acquired every 10 min.
Cortical neurons (E15.5) were cultured on coverslips (13mm diameter, 24 well-plate, #1.5) coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma, 0.5mg/ml) in Neurobasal medium (without phenol red for super resolution microscopy) supplemented with B27 (GIBCO Cat#17504044). After 2DIV, 0.2μg of Lphn1(Lec-Olf) or double mutant (Lec-Olf) TL-FL protein clustered with anti-his Alexa 488 antibody (Thermofisher cat#MA1-21315-A488, ratio 4:1 protein:Ig) was added to cortical neurons for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Neurons were washed twice with PBS and incubated with pre-clustered FLRT3 antibody (goat Ig, R&D, AF2795) with anti-goat Alexa-594 (Jackson, ImmunoResearch, Cat#705-585-003, ratio 4:1) and N-terminal Ten2 antibody (sheep, R&D, AF4578) with anti-sheep Alexa-647 (Jackson, ratio 4:1) for 20 min at RT. Neurons where washed twice with PBS and fixed for 20 min with 4% PFA at RT. Neurons were washed with ammonium chloride in PBS (50mM) for 5 min to quench the excess of PFA, followed by two washes with PBS and mounted with Immu-mount (Thermofisher, cat#10622689) for super resolution. In case of confocal microscopy, nuclei were stained with DAPI and samples were mounted with Dako (Agilent, cat#S3023). Confocal acquisition was done using a SP8 laser scanning confocal spectral microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg). Images were taken using a 63 × objective with a 2 × digital zoom and 1 Airy disk pinhole. Co-localization was quantified using the co-localization plugin of Image (version 1.51p) ( Schneider et al., 2012 76. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (19355) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Neurons were prepared as described above, and mounted in Immu-Mount (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) imaging on a Leica SR GSD system. The following settings where used for SMLM data acquisition: 642 nm laser at 40% of 500 mW output power for Alexa647, 560 nm laser at 100% of 500 mW output power for Alexa594 and 488 nm laser at 70% of 300 mW output power for Alexa488. For Alexa488 and Alexa647 low to moderate laser intensities of 405 nm were used for “back-pumping” to enhance single molecule blinking. For the position determination of the single fluorescent molecules we used a maximum-likelihood-based algorithm with a sliding window for background subtraction ( Grull et al., 2011 34. Grull, F. ∙ Kirchgessner, M. ∙ Kaufmann, R. ... Accelerating Image Analysis for Localization Microscopy with FPGAs. In 2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications IEEE, 2011 1-5 Google Scholar ). SMLM images where reconstructed based on the localization accuracies of the individual single molecule positions.
RNaseq data were accessed from the published NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with accession numbers GEO: GSE10881 ( Kawaguchi et al., 2008 44. Kawaguchi, A. ∙ Ikawa, T. ∙ Kasukawa, T. ... Single-cell gene profiling defines differential progenitor subclasses in mammalian neurogenesis Development. 2008; 135 :3113-3124 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and GSE65000 ( Florio et al., 2015 29.

Human-specific gene ARHGAP11B promotes basal progenitor amplification and neocortex expansion Science. 2015; 347 :1465-1470 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Values for specific genes from individual cells were averaged and displayed as whisker plots.
Embryonic brains were fixed in 4% PFA over-night and sectioned. 10 μm Cryo-sections were pre-treated using the RNAscope Universal Pretreatment Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Cat#322380). RNA In Situ Hybridizations (ISH) were performed using the RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Cat#320850) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The target genes (mouse Lphn1-3 and Ten1-4) are also listed in the Key Resources Table . Following ISH, sections were immunostained using mouse anti-Pvim 1/300 (Abcam, Cat#ab20346) and rat anti-Ctip2 1/600 (Abcam, Cat#ab123449) in combination with the Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies 1/200 (Jackson Immunoresearch). Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope and processed with ImageJ software.
Statistical analyses of were performed using GraphPad Prism, employing a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test when comparing two groups ( Figures S2 G, 3 C, 3F, 3I, S3 H, S3L, S3P, and S3R) or one-way ANOVA test with Tukey’s post hoc analysis when comparing multiple groups ( Figures 2 E, 2F, 2I, 4 B, 4H, S4 B, S4D, 5 B, 6 D, 6F, 6G, S6 E, 7 C, 7E, 7G, S7 B, and S7D) where P values represent ∗ p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.0001. All data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m, whisker plots or dot plots. All sample sizes and definitions are provided in the figure legends.
