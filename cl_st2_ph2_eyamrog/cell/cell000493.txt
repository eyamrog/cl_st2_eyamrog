Title: A genetically tractable jellyfish model for systems and evolutionary neuroscience


Abstract: Summary

Jellyfish are radially symmetric organisms without a brain that arose more than 500 million years ago. They achieve organismal behaviors through coordinated interactions between autonomously functioning body parts. Jellyfish neurons have been studied electrophysiologically, but not at the systems level. We introduce Clytia hemisphaerica as a transparent, genetically tractable jellyfish model for systems and evolutionary neuroscience. We generate stable F 1 transgenic lines for cell-type-specific conditional ablation and whole-organism GCaMP imaging. Using these tools and computational analyses, we find that an apparently diffuse network of RFamide-expressing umbrellar neurons is functionally subdivided into a series of spatially localized subassemblies whose synchronous activation controls directional food transfer from the tentacles to the mouth. These data reveal an unanticipated degree of structured neural organization in this species. Clytia affords a platform for systems-level studies of neural function, behavior, and evolution within a clade of marine organisms with growing ecological and economic importance.

Section: Introduction

Jellyfish offer insights into the structure, function, and evolution of nervous systems: they are apparent “living fossils,” whose last common ancestor with bilaterians emerged just after the appearance of neurons ( Figure 1 A) ( Arendt et al., 2016 2. Arendt, D. ∙ Tosches, M.A. ∙ Marlow, H. From nerve net to nerve ring, nerve cord and brain — evolution of the nervous system Nat. Rev.

Exceptionally Preserved Jellyfishes from the Middle Cambrian PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 :e1121 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Jellyfish use neurons homologous to our own ( Arendt et al., 2016 2. Arendt, D. ∙ Tosches, M.A. ∙ Marlow, H. From nerve net to nerve ring, nerve cord and brain — evolution of the nervous system Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :61-72 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bosch et al., 2017 4. Bosch, T.C.G. ∙ Klimovich, A. ∙ Domazet-Lošo, T. ...

How such organisms are able to feed themselves, navigate, escape from predators, and even sleep ( Mackie, 2004 33. Mackie, G.O.

Nawroth, J.C. ∙ Lee, H. ∙ Feinberg, A.W. ... A tissue-engineered jellyfish with biomimetic propulsion Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :792-797 Crossref Scopus (498) PubMed Google Scholar ). Jellyfish are also attracting growing interest as critical components of ocean ecosystems, in part due to jellyfish blooms and their negative economic impact ( Condon et al., 2013 8. Condon, R.H. ∙ Duarte, C.M. ∙ Pitt, K.A. ... Recurrent jellyfish blooms are a consequence of global oscillations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Despite the importance of jellyfish to evolution, ecology, and economics, remarkably little is known about the neural control of their behavior. Jellyfish neurons have been studied extensively using single-unit electrophysiological recordings ( Meech, 2019 36. Meech, R.W. Electrophysiology and behavior of Cnidarian nervous systems Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Neuroscience. Oxford University Press, 2019 Crossref Google Scholar ; Satterlie, 2002 47. Satterlie, R.A. Neuronal control of swimming in jellyfish: a comparative story Can. J. Zool. 2002; 80 :1654-1669 Crossref Google Scholar ), but systems-level analysis has been absent due to the lack of a genetically tractable model. Attractive features of jellyfish for systems neuroscience include their small size, relative planarity, and transparency, facilitating optical approaches ( Katsuki and Greenspan, 2013 23.

Existing cnidarian genetic neuroscience models, such as Hydra ( Dupre and Yuste, 2017 12. Dupre, C. ∙ Yuste, R. Non-overlapping Neural Networks in Hydra vulgaris Curr.

Here, we introduce the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica , originally established to study early development and evolution ( Houliston et al., 2010 19. Houliston, E. ∙ Momose, T. ∙ Manuel, M. Clytia hemisphaerica: a jellyfish cousin joins the laboratory Trends Genet. 2010; 26 :159-167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), as a genetic model for systems neuroscience. The Clytia genome has been sequenced ( Leclère et al., 2019 29. Leclère, L. ∙ Horin, C. ∙ Chevalier, S. ... The genome of the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica and the evolution of the cnidarian life-cycle Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2019; 3 :801-810 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ) and an atlas of its cell types generated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) ( Chari et al., 2021 6. Chari, T. ∙ Weissbourd, B. ∙ Gehring, J. ... Whole Animal Multiplexed Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Plasticity of Clytia Medusa Cell Types bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout has been reported ( Momose et al., 2018 38. Momose, T. ∙ Cian, A.D. ∙ Shiba, K. ... High doses of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein efficiently induce gene knockout with low mosaicism in the hydrozoan Clytia hemisphaerica through microhomology-mediated deletion Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :11734 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), but transgenesis has not yet been established.
In this inaugural study, we describe the generation of stable Clytia F 1 transgenic lines for population neural imaging and neuronal cell-type-specific ablation. Using these tools, we have investigated the neural control of feeding, in which captured food is vectorially transferred from the margin of the umbrella to the central mouth. We find that directional infolding of the umbrella is controlled by anatomically cryptic neural subassemblies that tile the umbrella, uncovering a surprising degree of structural organization within a superficially diffuse neural net. This work introduces Clytia as a genetically tractable model for systems neuroscience, affording a platform for understanding the neural control of its decentralized behavior and internal states and for comparative studies across phylogeny.

Section: Results

Jellyfish (medusae) are a free-swimming life stage within the phylum Cnidaria and subphylum Medusozoa ( Figures 1 A–1D) ( Leclère et al., 2019 29. Leclère, L. ∙ Horin, C. ∙ Chevalier, S. ... The genome of the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica and the evolution of the cnidarian life-cycle Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2019; 3 :801-810 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clytia medusae are small (∼1 mm–1.5 cm), optically transparent, and have ∼10,000 neurons in a 1-cm adult ( Figure 1 C) ( Chari et al., 2021 6. Chari, T. ∙ Weissbourd, B. ∙ Gehring, J. ... Whole Animal Multiplexed Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Plasticity of Clytia Medusa Cell Types bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Their anatomy exhibits hallmarks of the hydrozoan medusa body plan ( Figure 1 E): nerve rings ( Figure 1 F), circular and radial muscle ( Figure 1 G), and a subumbrellar nerve net ( Figure 1 H). Importantly, the tri-phasic sexual reproductive cycle ( Figure 1 D) can be recapitulated in the laboratory ( STAR Methods ) ( Houliston et al., 2010 19. Houliston, E. ∙ Momose, T. ∙ Manuel, M. Clytia hemisphaerica: a jellyfish cousin joins the laboratory Trends Genet. 2010; 26 :159-167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lechable et al., 2020 28. Lechable, M. ∙ Jan, A. ∙ Duchene, A. ... An improved whole life cycle culture protocol for the hydrozoan genetic model Clytia hemisphaerica Biol. Open. 2020; 9 :bio051268 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Following controlled fertilization, zygotes develop into a planula (larval) stage. Planulae attach to a substrate (microscope slide) where they form clonal polyp colonies that release free-swimming medusae, and which can be vegetatively propagated. The entire life cycle takes ∼6–8 weeks.
Neurons immunoreactive for an RFamide (RFa) peptide have previously been identified in Clytia ( Mackie et al., 1985 34. Mackie, G.O. ∙ Singla, C.L. ∙ Stell, W.K. Distribution of Nerve Elements Showing FMRFamide-like Immunoreactivity in Hydromedusae Acta Zoologica. 1985; 66 :199-210 Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar ) and have been suggested to play a role in medusa defensive and feeding behaviors ( Mackie, 2003 32. Mackie, G.O. Central circuitry in the jellyfish Aglantha digitale IV. Pathways coordinating feeding behaviour J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206 :2487-2505 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Satterlie, 2008 48. Satterlie, R.A.

Smooth muscle fibers of Podocoryne carnea (Hydrozoa) demonstrated by a specific monoclonal antibody and their association with neurons showing FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255 :275-282 Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar ). We confirmed RFa immunoreactivity in the nerve net, mouth, nerve rings, and tentacles ( Figures 2 A–2C and S1 A–S1G). RFa + neurons comprised a large subpopulation (∼80%) of nerve net neurons identified using tyrosinated tubulin, a generic neuronal marker ( Gröger and Schmid, 2000 17. Gröger, H. ∙ Schmid, V. Nerve net differentiation in medusa development of Podocoryne carnea Sci. Mar. 2000; 64 :107-116 Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 A, S1 A, and S1B). They were radially oriented, with varicosities apposed to radial muscle fibers ( Figures 2 B, S1 C, and S1D). In contrast, RFa-negative neurons in the nerve net were generally smaller and lacked a clear radial orientation ( Figures 2 A, arrow, S1 A, and S1B). RFa + neurons in other body parts were less abundant than in the nerve net (∼10% of total neurons in Clytia by scRNA-seq) ( Chari et al., 2021 6. Chari, T. ∙ Weissbourd, B. ∙ Gehring, J. ... Whole Animal Multiplexed Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Plasticity of Clytia Medusa Cell Types bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
To gain genetic access to RFa + neurons, we established transgenesis in Clytia ( STAR Methods ). Plasmid and Tol2 transposase were co-injected into Clytia eggs ( Figure S1 H) ( Koga et al., 1996 26. Koga, A. ∙ Suzuki, M. ∙ Inagaki, H. ... Transposable element in fish Nature. 1996; 383 :30 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ni et al., 2016 41. Ni, J. ∙ Wangensteen, K.J. ∙ Nelsen, D. ... Active recombinant Tol2 transposase for gene transfer and gene discovery applications Mob. DNA. 2016; 7 :6 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), and polyp colonies were screened for expression of an mCherry reporter. Strongly expressing colonies were cultured until they produced F 0 medusae, which were backcrossed to parental strains. Approximately 100% of these backcrosses yielded germline transmission. Stable F 1 progeny were maintained and expanded vegetatively as clonal polyp colonies that released non-mosaic, transgenic medusae that could be collected daily ( Figures 1 D and S1 H).
We first ablated the RFa + neurons to determine the effect on the organism’s behavior. To this end, we cloned 6.6 kb of 5′ flanking DNA from the Clytia RFamide precursor gene and inserted it upstream of a bi-cistronic construct encoding nitroreductase ( NTR ) ( Curado et al., 2008 10. Curado, S. ∙ Stainier, D.Y.R. ∙ Anderson, R.M.

Direct activation of the Mauthner cell by electric field pulses drives ultrarapid escape responses J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 112 :834-844 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mCherry, separated by a 2A peptide ( Figure 2 D) ( Daniels et al., 2014 11. Daniels, R.W. ∙ Rossano, A.J. ∙ Macleod, G.T. ... Expression of Multiple Transgenes from a Single Construct Using Viral 2A Peptides in Drosophila PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e100637 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Addition of the drug metronidazole (MTZ) causes autonomous ablation of cells expressing NTR, which converts MTZ to its toxic form ( Figure 2 E) ( White and Mumm, 2013 57. White, D.T. ∙ Mumm, J.S. The Nitroreductase System of Inducible Targeted Ablation Facilitates Cell-specific Regenerative Studies in Zebrafish Methods. 2013; 62 :232-240 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The RFamide 5′ genomic fragment successfully drove strong and specific mCherry expression in the umbrellar RFa + network (∼92% of RFa + neurons targeted, 100% of targeted neurons were RFa + ) ( Figure 2 D). A 24-h incubation in MTZ efficiently eliminated RFa + neurons in the TG RFa::NTR-2A-mCherry line ( Figures 2 D and 2F). Other neuronal populations were intact, demonstrating that ablation of RFa + neurons was specific ( Figure 2 G). No ablation was observed in controls with either MTZ or the NTR transgene omitted ( Figure 2 F).
The umbrella is involved in several behaviors, including swimming, feeding, and defensive crumpling ( Hyman, 1940 20. Hyman, L.H. Observations and Experiments on the Physiology of Medusae Biol. Bull. 1940; 79 :282-296 Crossref Google Scholar ; Romanes, 1885 46. Romanes, G.J. Jelly-Fish, Star-Fish, and Sea Urchins: Being a Research on Primitive Nervous Systems D. Appleton and Co., New York, 1885 Crossref Google Scholar ). Although swimming and crumpling utilize symmetrical umbrellar contractions, feeding employs asymmetric contractions that vectorially transfer captured food (brine shrimp, Artemia ) from contracted tentacles at the umbrella margin to the elongated feeding organ (“mouth”), which extends from the center of the umbrella ( Figures 1 C and 1E; Video S1 ). Swimming stops ( Figure S2 F), and the mouth bends (“points”) toward the infolding portion of the margin to receive the food ( Figures 3 A and 3B) (“pointing”). Food transfer is robust: 96% of first transfer attempts occurred within 1 min of prey capture, of which 88% were successful ( Figures S2 G and S2H). 96.3% (52/54) of caught prey were eventually eaten.

Spontaneous and prey-evoked margin folding behavior, related to Figures 2 and 3
Remarkably, RFa + neuron ablation completely eliminated asymmetric inward folding and hence the transfer of shrimp captured by the tentacles ( Figure 2 H). Ablation also prevented folding induced by chemosensory stimulation using shrimp extract ( Figure 2 I). Thus, RFa + neurons are required for both food-induced and chemically induced margin folding. In contrast, swimming and crumpling were unperturbed ( Figures 2 J, 2K, and S2 A–S2C), suggesting that other neural cell types control these behaviors ( King and Spencer, 1981 24. King, M.G. ∙ Spencer, A.N. The involvement of nerves in the epithelial control of crumpling behavior in a hydrozoan jellyfish J. Exp. Biol. 1981; 94 :203-218 Crossref Google Scholar ).
Bath application of synthetic RFa peptide to transgenic medusae following RFa + neuron ablation caused radial muscle contraction, confirming that the muscle was functionally intact ( Figure S2 D). Local infusion of RFa but not control peptide into the subumbrella caused local muscle contraction and margin infolding ( Figure S2 E). These data suggest that local release of peptide from RFa + neurons activates the muscle, either directly or via an intermediate cell population, to determine the site of margin folding.
These results prompted us to investigate margin folding behavior in more detail. First, we tested the necessity and sufficiency of different body parts using surgical manipulations. Mouth pointing toward the infolding margin was blocked if the umbrella was cut between the mouth and the margin, whereas margin folding was not ( Figure 3 C). Following excision of the mouth, the body swims, captures prey, and tries to pass prey to the hole where the mouth formerly was ( Video S3 ). The mouth-less umbrella also performed margin folding in response to shrimp extract ( Figure 3 J), which can trigger directional folding when locally applied ( Figures 3 D and S2 J; Video S2 ). Shrimp extract could also trigger margin folding when tentacles and tentacle bulbs were removed ( Figures 3 K and S2 K). Removal of other body parts revealed a similar theme of modular functional organization, confirming earlier studies ( Romanes, 1885 46. Romanes, G.J.

Directionally appropriate folding triggered by local application of shrimp extract, related to Figure 3
Clytia also performed margin folding in the absence of any added stimuli (13.7% ± 15% of time observed, mean ± SD), which was visually indistinguishable from evoked folding behavior ( Figures 3 E and S2 I; Video S1 ). To quantify margin folding and compare spontaneous to prey-evoked behavior, we trained an automated classifier to discriminate margin folding from swimming with high accuracy, using the major and minor axes of the umbrella as features ( Figures 3 F–3I). When trained on spontaneous folding alone, the same classifier could identify episodes of induced folding evoked by live shrimp or shrimp extract with similar accuracy ( Figure 3 I).
To investigate whether margin folding behavior was a fixed-action stimulus-response reflex or was modulated by internal state ( Anderson and Adolphs, 2014 1. Anderson, D.J. ∙ Adolphs, R. A Framework for Studying Emotions across Species Cell. 2014; 157 :187-200 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined the effect of food deprivation. Animals starved for 24 h performed food passing significantly faster than ad libitum fed controls, following prey capture ( Figure 3 L). In addition, spontaneous folding behavior failed to occur when the animals were spawning ( Figure 3 M). Last, when multiple shrimp were captured simultaneously they were transferred to the mouth sequentially rather than coordinately, at a rate higher than chance ( Figures S2 L and S2M). Margin folding is therefore modulated by at least two internal states (metabolic and reproductive) and involves coordination across different sectors of the umbrella.
To determine how RFa + neuronal activity correlates with margin folding behavior, we generated a transgenic F 1 line bi-cistronically expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6s and mCherry (TG RFa::GCaMP6s-2A-mCherry ) ( Figure 4 A) ( Chen et al., 2013 7. Chen, T.-W. ∙ Wardill, T.J. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity Nature. 2013; 499 :295-300 Crossref Scopus (4198) PubMed Google Scholar ). This transgenic line also had a high efficiency and specificity of targeting RFa + neurons (∼94% of RFa + neurons targeted, 100% of targeted neurons were RFa + ). Because GCaMP imaging was partially obscured by umbrellar expression of the endogenous GFP1 gene ( Fourrage et al., 2014 15. Fourrage, C. ∙ Swann, K. ∙ Gonzalez Garcia, J.R. ... An endogenous green fluorescent protein-photoprotein pair in Clytia hemisphaerica eggs shows co-targeting to mitochondria and efficient bioluminescence energy transfer Open Biol. 2014; 4 :130206 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), we knocked out this gene using CRISPR/Cas9 ( Momose et al., 2018 38. Momose, T. ∙ Cian, A.D. ∙ Shiba, K. ... High doses of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein efficiently induce gene knockout with low mosaicism in the hydrozoan Clytia hemisphaerica through microhomology-mediated deletion Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :11734 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the TG RFa::GCaMP6s-2A-mCherry genetic background ( Figure S3 A).
We performed wide-field, two-color, in vivo imaging in TG RFa::GCaMP6s-2A-mCherry/+ ;GFP1 −/− transgenic jellyfish, using either restrained or unrestrained preparations to balance GCaMP signal extraction and naturalistic behavior ( Figures 4 B, 4C, and S3 B–S3D). In the unrestrained preparation, animals could behave freely in the small imaging chamber, allowing identification and localization of active neurons within the subumbrellar nerve net. However, extraction of GCaMP traces from individual cells was not possible due to movement (“naturalistically behaving”) ( Figures 4 H–4J; Video S3 ). Preparations in which the jellyfish were relatively motionless (“restrained”) using agarose embedding allowed extraction of high-quality GCaMP traces from single neurons ( Figures 5 A–5C and S4 B; Video S5 ). Due to variation in the agarose-embedded preparations (see STAR Methods ), in some animals there was both sufficient restraint to extract single-cell traces and sufficient freedom of movement to identify apparent attempts at swimming or folding (“loosely restrained”) ( Figures 4 D–4G).

Attempted food passing after excision of the mouth, related to Figure 3
Movements interpreted as attempted “swimming” comprised high-frequency, circumferential contractions, whereas those interpreted as attempted “folding” comprised low-frequency, radial movements ( Figures 4 D and S3 E). To quantify these behaviors in such loosely restrained preparations, we extracted optic flow vectors across frames from the imaging videos ( Figure S3 B, E1 and E2). Classifiers trained on these features could distinguish behaviors in held-out test frames with high accuracy (swimming, accuracy = 0.85 ± 0.04; folding, accuracy = 0.81 ± 0.03, mean ± SEM) ( Figure S3 E3). We used the mCherry channel to segment neurons and exclude that GCaMP signals reflected motion artifacts ( Figures 4 E, S3 H, S3I, and S4 K).
In loosely restrained preparations in which both attempted margin folding and swimming movements occurred, behavioral epochs and neural activity could be aligned to examine their temporal relationship ( Figures 4 E–4G). Patches of RFa + neurons in both the nerve rings and net were strongly activated at the onset of folding, but not swimming ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Neural activity in the patches was relatively synchronous ( Figure 4 E). Using population neural activity, we trained a 3-way classifier to predict quiescence, swimming, or folding and found that folding episodes could be predicted with high accuracy, whereas swimming could not be distinguished from quiescence ( Figure 4 G). Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the largest source of variance in RFa + neural activity occurred during folding ( Figure S3 F). These data indicate that RFa + neuronal activity is temporally and specifically associated with margin folding behavior. The NTR ablation data ( Figures 2 H and 2I) indicate, moreover, that this activity is likely a cause and not a consequence of this behavior.
To examine the pattern of RFa + neuronal activation more broadly across the nerve net under conditions where complete margin folding could be performed, we imaged GCaMP in the unrestrained preparation ( Figure 4 H) in three contexts: (1) spontaneously (i.e., no stimuli given) ( Figures 3 E and S2 I), (2) with shrimp extract uniformly present, or (3) with intact shrimp presented to the tentacles. We manually extracted body shape and identified the location of active neurons during individual folding events. In both the spontaneous and evoked contexts, RFa + neurons in the nerve net were activated in radially oriented, wedge-shaped patches located at the epicenter of margin infolding ( Figures 4 I, 4J, and S3 H–S3K; Video S4 ). Thus, RFa + neuronal activity is temporally correlated with both evoked and spontaneous margin folding and is spatially localized at the site of each folding event ( Figure 4 K).

GCaMP imaging of the nerve net in an agarose-restrained animal, related to Figure 5
The observation of local ensembles of synchronously active RFa + neurons raised the question of whether these neurons activate each other, as well as the radial muscle, via release of RFamide peptide. To address this question, we perfused RFamide during GCaMP imaging. RFamide addition did not detectably activate RFa + neurons ( Figure S3 G). This suggests that the peptide may not be used for excitatory, inter-RFa + neurotransmission, but does not exclude the possibility that these neurons communicate via an unidentified co-transmitter or peptide.
To further examine the pattern of ensemble activity in the RFa + system ( Figures 4 J and 4K), we performed whole umbrella imaging in animals that were well restrained in agarose ( Figures 5 A, S4 A, and S4B). These preparations revealed spatially localized ensembles of RFa + neurons that exhibited repeated events of spontaneous, synchronous activity ( Figures 5 B, 5C, S4 B, and S4C). These ensembles appeared as radially oriented, wedge-shaped populations that stretched between the margin and the mouth ( Figure 5 B; Video S5 ), similar to the pattern observed in naturalistically behaving animals ( Figure 4 ). The radial organization of ensembles was obvious along the diagonal of a neuronal activity correlation matrix in which neurons were sorted by their relative angular position ( Figure 5 D). However, the correlation pattern was not a series of sharply defined blocks, but rather patches of variable size with diffuse borders, indicating variability in ensemble membership across individual events.
Closer inspection of the correlation matrix revealed structure on multiple spatial scales, with very high correlations between neighboring neurons, as well as weaker, distance-dependent correlations ( Figures 5 D, S4 D, and S4E). To identify core groups of highly correlated neurons active during repeated events of spontaneous activity, we used k-means clustering. This revealed striking spatial groupings that roughly tiled the animal ( Figure 5 E). However, ensemble membership between individual events was flexible, and many events were not restricted to single k-means clusters ( Figure 5 F). This variability suggests that active ensembles are not defined exclusively by deterministic connectivity rules (see below).
We next asked whether inter-episodic variability in ensemble membership reflected the flexible recruitment of cells from neighboring clusters. We first plotted the activity of individual neurons across multiple spontaneous events, grouping neurons by k-means cluster membership and sorting clusters by their relative radial positions ( Figure 5 G). We then simplified the results by graphing which clusters were active during each event, not which neurons were active (compare Figures 5 G to 5H). Next, we asked how much of the observed activity could be explained by ensembles comprising single versus multiple clusters.
Restricting ensembles to members of single k-means clusters explained much, but not all, of the observed activity over time (F1 score: ∼0.66) ( Figure 5 I, violet bar). However, allowing ensembles to flexibly incorporate multiple clusters better explained the observed activity (F1 score: ∼0.82) ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Spontaneous events restricted to single clusters were only slightly more frequent than those incorporating an additional cluster(s) ( Figure 5 J). Neighboring clusters were most often co-active ( Figure 5 K), although not all members of such clusters participated in each event ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Thus, inter-episodic variation in ensemble membership ( Figure 5 L) is best explained by a flexible incorporation of neurons from adjacent clusters into ensembles initiated by a “core” k-means cluster.
Because k-means forces neurons into single clusters, as an alternative way to capture flexibility in inter-episodic ensemble membership, we used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) followed by independent components analysis (ICA) ( Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013 31. Lopes-dos-Santos, V. ∙ Ribeiro, S. ∙ Tort, A.B.L. Detecting cell assemblies in large neuronal populations J. Neurosci. Methods. 2013; 220 :149-166 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ; See et al., 2018 50. See, J.Z. ∙ Atencio, C.A. ∙ Sohal, V.S. ... Coordinated neuronal ensembles in primary auditory cortical columns eLife. 2018; 7 :e35587 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) to cluster active cells. In this method, individual neurons can be members of more than one cluster. Among neurons assigned to NMF-ICA clusters, the majority participated in only a single cluster (∼89%), with fewer participating in 2 (∼10%) or 3 clusters (<1%; n = 489 neurons from 4 animals) ( Figures S4 F and S4G). Thus, whether cluster membership is defined rigidly (k-means) or more flexibly (NMF/ICA), clusters emerge as principle units of spontaneous RFa + network activity, with episodic variability in ensemble membership reflecting fluctuations in nearest-neighbor recruitment ( Figure 5 F).
A close examination of umbrellar anatomy did not any reveal identifiable structural correlates on the scale of these subassemblies ( Figures S4 H–S4J), and no obvious structure was evident in the mCherry channel ( Figure S4 K). Therefore, the spontaneously active ensembles within the RFa + nerve net appear to be anatomically cryptic, at least at the level of light microscopy.
Spontaneous activity in the nerve rings encircling the umbrella also showed spatial clustering. Ring clusters were highly correlated with subjacent nerve net clusters ( Figures 5 M, 5N, and S4 L–S4N). These observations suggested a possible flow of information between the RFa + neurons in the nerve rings and net. We therefore examined the directionality of this flow. Nerve net activation always had a nerve ring correlate, but ring activity did not always coincide with a net event ( Figure S5 B). Correlated ring activity was initiated prior to net activity during spontaneous events ( Figures 5 O and S5 C). Furthermore, neurons in excised fragments of the ring responded to shrimp extract, but neurons in net fragments only responded if the margin was attached ( Figure S5 D), suggesting a dependence of net neurons on ring neurons for evoked activity. Consistent with this, excising the margin (containing the rings, Figure 1 E) eliminated evoked folding behavior in the remaining umbrellar tissue ( Figure S5 A). Histology suggested that processes from ring and net neurons were intermingled at the margin ( Figure S5 E). Attempts to map process origin by focal dye labeling were unsuccessful.
We further examined information flow by generating transverse incisions in the subumbrella and monitoring whether spontaneous nerve net activity could be observed on the ring (peripheral) side of the wound, the mouth (central) side, or both ( Figure 5 P). We observed spontaneous activity peripheral but not central to the incisions ( Figure 5 P; Video S6 ). Thus, information flows from the rings into the nerve net, where it continues centripetally toward the mouth ( Figure 5 Q).

The foregoing data raised the question of whether that radial umbrellar fragments containing tentacles, the mouth, and RFa + neurons in both the nerve rings and the net might perform food-passing behavior autonomously. Indeed, such isolated wedge-shaped sectors were able to pass shrimp from the margin to the mouth ( Figure S5 F; Video S7 ).

An excised strip of the umbrella can perform the complete food passing behavior, related to Figure 5
The foregoing analysis raised the question of whether stimulus-evoked ensembles can emerge at arbitrary locations in the RFa + subnetwork, or whether they are spatially constrained by the clusters revealed in our analysis of spontaneous events. To distinguish these alternatives, we quantitatively compared spontaneous to evoked ensemble activity in the same animal ( Figures 6 A–6C, S5 G, and S5H) using the subspace alignment metric ( Elsayed et al., 2016 14. Elsayed, G.F. ∙ Lara, A.H. ∙ Kaufman, M.T. ... Reorganization between preparatory and movement population responses in motor cortex Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13239 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yoo and Hayden, 2020 59. Yoo, S.B.M. ∙ Hayden, B.Y. The Transition from Evaluation to Selection Involves Neural Subspace Reorganization in Core Reward Regions Neuron. 2020; 105 :712-724.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). This metric tests the variance in evoked activity epochs explained by the principal components of spontaneous epochs.
We observed high subspace alignment between spontaneous and evoked epochs (85% ± 1.21%, mean ± SEM, Figure 6 D), which was similar to the alignment between two sets of spontaneous epochs (83% ± 4%, mean ± SEM) and was significantly different from the alignment between randomly generated subspaces ( Figure 6 E; p = 0.0079). These high alignment indices suggest that evoked ensemble structure may be constrained by an intrinsic pre-pattern exhibited during spontaneous episodes.
As an independent method for comparing spontaneous to evoked ensembles, we trained generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict the activity of each imaged neuron using the weighted activity of all other imaged neurons ( Efron et al., 2004 13. Efron, B. ∙ Hastie, T. ∙ Johnstone, I. ... Least angle regression Ann. Stat. 2004; 32 :407-499 Crossref Scopus (6741) Google Scholar ; Mishchenko et al., 2011 37. Mishchenko, Y. ∙ Vogelstein, J.T. ∙ Paninski, L. A Bayesian approach for inferring neuronal connectivity from calcium fluorescent imaging data Ann. Appl. Stat. 2011; 5 :1229-1261 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ; Pillow et al., 2008 43. Pillow, J.W. ∙ Shlens, J. ∙ Paninski, L. ... Spatio-temporal correlations and visual signalling in a complete neuronal population Nature. 2008; 454 :995-999 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ). GLMs trained and tested on spontaneous activity recapitulated the activity of a given cell with high accuracy (83% ± 1.3%, mean ± SEM) ( Figure 6 F). More importantly, GLMs trained on spontaneous activity and tested on stimulus-evoked neural activity exhibited similarly high accuracy (80% ± 1.4%, mean ± SEM) ( Figures 6 F and S5 I). These results further argue that spontaneous and evoked RFa + ensembles share common structural constraints.
To examine possible circuit implementations of observed ensemble activity, we undertook a modeling approach. We constructed a series of spiking neural network models, each of which incorporated different assumptions about underlying connectivity ( Figures 7 A–7D). At one extreme, we assumed that connectivity strength between a given RFa + neuron and its neighbors was not fixed, but rather declined continuously as a function of their angular distance (“continuous”) ( Figure 7 B). At the opposite extreme, we assumed all neurons were hard-wired into non-interacting subnetworks, with each neuron connected to all other members of its subnetwork with equal strength (“structured”) ( Figure 7 C). Finally, we generated hybrid models using weighted combinations of continuous versus structured connectivity ( Figure 7 D). For each type of model, we tuned both the strength and angular extent of network connectivity to best fit two observed statistics: the circumferential width of each spontaneous event, and the percent of neurons recruited per event ( Figures S6 A–S6E; STAR Methods ).
The best fit to the data was achieved using hybrid models combining both continuous and structured connectivity ( Figures 7 D, S6 C, and S6D). A model using only discontinuous structures had the lowest performance ( Figure 7 C); some degree of continuous connectivity was essential for the model to exhibit inter-episodic flexibility in event boundaries, as observed experimentally. The relative contribution of structured versus continuous connectivity did not strongly effect performance, as long as structured connectivity was present ( Figures S6 C and S6D). In all best-fit models, continuous connectivity was sparse and local, with each neuron only forming synapses with a small number of its nearest neighbors ( Figures S6 C and S6E). These findings support a model in which spatially localized but flexible ensembles are generated by combining “core” networks with continuously graded, local connectivity.
The foregoing model assumes that local connectivity between net neurons, as well as coordinated input from ring neurons, accounts for the synchronous activity of ensemble members. To evaluate the relative contributions of ring → net versus net → net connectivity to this synchronicity, we first trained GLMs using recordings that included both ring and net neurons ( Figure 5 ). These GLMs performed with high accuracy (76% ± 1.2%, mean ± SEM) ( Figure S7 A). Matrices of fitted GLM weights between RFa + neurons (i.e., inferences of connection strengths) ( Mishchenko et al., 2011 37. Mishchenko, Y. ∙ Vogelstein, J.T. ∙ Paninski, L. A Bayesian approach for inferring neuronal connectivity from calcium fluorescent imaging data Ann. Appl. Stat. 2011; 5 :1229-1261 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ) revealed that the GLMs used only sparse, local weights ( Figures 7 E and 7F), which was not due to GLM regularization ( Figure S7 B). This pattern of sparse connectivity was similar to our best fit network models ( Figures S6 C1–S6D1).
To determine whether synchronous firing in the umbrellar net ensembles could be explained purely by coordinated ring → net input, we digitally “ablated” intra-umbrellar network connectivity from our GLMs, either after or before training but prior to testing ( Figures S7 C–S7J). These “ablated” GLMs performed significantly less well than the “intact” GLMs (ablated, 54% ± 2%; intact, 82% ± 0.6%) ( Figures S7 C–S7J). These results strengthen the idea that sparse, local net → net connectivity contributes to the observed synchronicity of ensemble activity.
Finally, we examined the relationship between GLM weights (connection strength), and the angle of connections relative to the mouth. Interestingly, both ring → net and net → net connectivity was primarily oriented radially, whereas ring → ring connectivity was primarily horizontally/circumferentially ( Figure 7 G; net-net versus ring-ring, p = 3.5e−70; ring-net versus ring-ring, p = 5.7e−15; net-net versus ring-net, p = 0.8). This suggests that the radial and circumferential extent of ensembles may reflect intrinsic constraints on connectivity within the net and ring RFa + subnetworks, respectively.

Section: Discussion

Here, we introduce the jellyfish, Clytia hemisphaerica , as a new model for systems and evolutionary neuroscience. Clytia combines optical accessibility and genetic tractability with a varied behavioral repertoire. We report germline transgenesis in this organism and a systems-level interrogation of neural activity. Clytia offers opportunities to study neural development, function, evolution, and behavior in an organism that provides a window into the first nervous systems on the planet.
Among cnidarian genetic models, Clytia is complementary in several respects. First and foremost, Clytia has a medusa stage, whereas the others (e.g., Hydra ) are polyps ( Bosch et al., 2017 4. Bosch, T.C.G. ∙ Klimovich, A. ∙ Domazet-Lošo, T. ... Back to the Basics: Cnidarians Start to Fire Trends Neurosci. 2017; 40 :92-105 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Understanding the particulars of jellyfish behavioral control is relevant to their growing ecological and economic importance. Second, the medusa stage offers a relatively rich behavioral repertoire in comparison to polyps ( Costello et al., 2021 9. Costello, J.H. ∙ Colin, S.P. ∙ Dabiri, J.O. ... The Hydrodynamics of Jellyfish Swimming Annu. Rev. Mar. Sci. 2021; 13 :375-396 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, Clytia affords several advantages over Hydra as a genetically tractable model. It allows routine generation of stable F 1 lines, whereas in Hydra only F 0 transgenics have been used for neural imaging ( Dupre and Yuste, 2017 12. Dupre, C. ∙ Yuste, R. Non-overlapping Neural Networks in Hydra vulgaris Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :1085-1097 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, Clytia husbandry permits inter-strain genetic crosses, which are currently difficult to achieve in Hydra ( Klimovich et al., 2019 25. Klimovich, A. ∙ Wittlieb, J. ∙ Bosch, T.C.G. Transgenesis in Hydra to characterize gene function and visualize cell behavior Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :2069-2090 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, transgenesis is more easily scaled up in Clytia , where thousands of unfertilized eggs can be generated for injection daily. In contrast, the Hydra life cycle limits the availability of embryos ( Figure S1 H) ( Klimovich et al., 2019 25. Klimovich, A. ∙ Wittlieb, J. ∙ Bosch, T.C.G. Transgenesis in Hydra to characterize gene function and visualize cell behavior Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :2069-2090 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Imaging results in Clytia afford an interesting comparison to those obtained in Hydra ( Dupre and Yuste, 2017 12. Dupre, C. ∙ Yuste, R. Non-overlapping Neural Networks in Hydra vulgaris Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :1085-1097 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), another hydrozoan species that is a free-living polyp lacking a medusa stage. The Hydra neural net is divided into several functionally distinct subnetworks, whose activity is correlated with different types of polyp movement (contraction, extension, and bending) ( Dupre and Yuste 2017 12. Dupre, C. ∙ Yuste, R. Non-overlapping Neural Networks in Hydra vulgaris Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :1085-1097 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). These subnetworks are not spatially separated, but overlapping. As in Hydra , the Clytia umbrellar neural net comprises multiple subnetworks, including the RFa + subnetwork. In contrast to Hydra , however, this subnetwork is further parcellated into functional subassemblies ( Figure 7 H). These spatially distinct subassemblies therefore represent a more complex level of neural structural organization in Clytia than in Hydra ( Figure 7 J). Going forward, comparisons between Clytia , Hydra , and other cnidarian model organisms should provide important insights into neural network and behavioral evolution ( Bosch et al., 2017 4. Bosch, T.C.G. ∙ Klimovich, A. ∙ Domazet-Lošo, T. ... Back to the Basics: Cnidarians Start to Fire Trends Neurosci. 2017; 40 :92-105 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A striking feature of Clytia behavior is its extreme functional modularity: for example, an isolated mouth can ingest food, and margin folding can occur in a “mouth-less” umbrella. Nevertheless, in intact jellyfish, the mouth points toward the infolding margin during food transfer, revealing coordination between these modules. Such coordination is also observed during food-passing in wedge-shaped strips of Clytia umbrella containing the mouth ( Figure S5 F). These data suggest that functionally autonomous behavioral modules (e.g., mouth and umbrella) are combined to form coordinated “super-modules,” copies of which are arrayed circumferentially around the umbrella. Such a mechanism accommodates the continuous growth that jellyfish exhibit.
If this hierarchical view is correct, coordinated behaviors in organisms lacking a central brain may have emerged by duplication and modification of smaller autonomous modules to form functionally interacting super-modules. How these interactions are achieved remains to be determined. Over time, modification of super-modules might give rise to new structures and organism-level behaviors. Such a nested modular organization could therefore be an important substrate for the evolution of complex behaviors.
Clytia have a remarkable ability to regenerate and recover behaviorally following injury ( Kamran et al., 2017 22. Kamran, Z. ∙ Zellner, K. ∙ Kyriazes, H. ... In vivo imaging of epithelial wound healing in the cnidarian Clytia hemisphaerica demonstrates early evolution of purse string and cell crawling closure mechanisms BMC Dev. Biol. 2017; 17 :17 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sinigaglia et al., 2020 52. Sinigaglia, C. ∙ Peron, S. ∙ Eichelbrenner, J. ... Pattern regulation in a regenerating jellyfish eLife. 2020; 9 :e54868 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). They also continuously integrate new stem cell-derived neurons into their nervous system as they grow, without disrupting organismal behavior ( Chari et al., 2021 6. Chari, T. ∙ Weissbourd, B. ∙ Gehring, J. ... Whole Animal Multiplexed Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Plasticity of Clytia Medusa Cell Types bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The local network interactions and modular organization that we have described may facilitate such continuous growth and repair. Clytia affords a genetically tractable model to investigate the dynamics of such regeneration in real time, a process at the interface of neural development and systems-level function.
Our conclusions are largely based on analysis of spontaneous episodes of neural activity in immobilized animals. These episodes likely correspond to spontaneous activity accompanying margin folding events observed in freely moving animals, because spontaneous activity without folding was not seen in such animals. We cannot exclude that such “spontaneous” events are triggered by microscopic exogenous stimuli, rather than endogenously generated. Furthermore, activity in immobilized animals may exhibit subtle differences from that in freely moving jellyfish. Our analyses relied on a finite number of spontaneous ensemble events (∼100/animal); significantly more events could change the observed correlation structure. Last, imaging was performed in juvenile jellyfish: the functional organization described here may change as the animal grows.

Culture of the Clytia life cycle was carried out in accordance with published protocols ( Lechable et al., 2020 28. Lechable, M. ∙ Jan, A. ∙ Duchene, A. ... An improved whole life cycle culture protocol for the hydrozoan genetic model Clytia hemisphaerica Biol. Open. 2020; 9 :bio051268 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), with the exception of the culture tank design. Circulating systems used here had the same overall flow design as in Lechable et al. (2020) 28. Lechable, M. ∙ Jan, A. ∙ Duchene, A. ... An improved whole life cycle culture protocol for the hydrozoan genetic model Clytia hemisphaerica Biol. Open. 2020; 9 :bio051268 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , but used modifications of zebrafish tanks (Pentair) for animal housing. Polyp slides were held in glass slide racks (Fisher, cat#02-912-615) in small tanks with high water flow. Jellyfish were cultured in large-sized tanks with a curved plastic insert placed at the back of the tank with a nylon mesh outlet at the bottom. A slow drip from the circulating system into these tanks allowed for water turnover without risking sweeping the jellyfish through the outlet. A constant speed 5 rpm DC motor (Uxcell) attached to the lid of a multi-well tissue culture plate was then used to create a constant circular current. A dimmer switch was used to tune the rotation speed of the motor, with reduced speeds as the jellyfish grew. Jellyfish used for transgenesis, and all polyps, were maintained in these circulating systems, while smaller jellyfish were maintained in beakers. In beakers, current was generated using stirring with a DC motor, as above. All artificial sea water for culture and experiments was made using Red Sea Salts (Bulk Reef Supply, cat# 207077) diluted into building deionized water to 36 parts per thousand (ppt).
Unless otherwise indicated, behavior experiments were performed using sexually mature animals of the Z4B strain of Clytia, which are female. Transgenesis was performed by crossing Z4B females to Z13 males. For generating experimental F 1 lines, NTR and GCaMP lines were backcrossed to Z4B. A single F 1 polyp colony was then chosen to maintain for each strain to control for genetic background. Clonal experimental animals were then collected from these polyp colonies. Experiments and culture were performed at room temperature.
For antibody staining, Clytia were fixed for 2h at room temperature in 4% PFA in 0.2μm filtered artificial sea water (Red Sea Salts, Bulk Reef Supply, cat# 207077, diluted into building deionized water to 36 ppt). They were then washed 3x in PBS followed by blocking for 1h in PBS with 0.1% Triton (PBST) and 10% normal donkey serum (NDS). Animals were then incubated for 1-3 nights in primary antibody with 5% NDS in PBST at 4°C. Primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-FMRF (Immunostar, cat# 20091), anti-Tyrosine Tubulin (Sigma cat# T9028-100UL), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti- a Tubulin, clone DM1a (Millipore Sigma cat# 05-829-AF647), and anti- a Tubulin (YL1/2; Thermofisher cat# MA1-80017). Following primary antibody incubation, one short (∼5min) and then 3-4 long (∼30min+) washes were performed in PBST, and then animals were transferred into secondary antibodies and/or Phalloidin-488 (Thermo Fisher, cat# A12379) for 2h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 or 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch cat# 711-605-152 and Thermofisher cat# A-21206), or donkey anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermofisher cat# A-31571). Animals were stained with DAPI (BD cat#564907) and mounted onto glass slides for imaging. For staining shown in Figure 1 F, animals were dehydrated stepwise into methanol and then rehydrated prior to the blocking step. Quantification of overlap related to transgenesis targeting efficiency was from at least 3 separate subumbrellar locations/each from at least 3 animals. In situ hybridization was carried out as described in Chari et al. (2021) 6. Chari, T. ∙ Weissbourd, B. ∙ Gehring, J. ... Whole Animal Multiplexed Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Plasticity of Clytia Medusa Cell Types bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar , including the RFamide (pp5) probe, which was the same as the one used in that study. Imaging of histological specimens was carried out using an Olympus FV3000 confocal. Multicolor micrographs shown throughout are pseudocolored composites, with brightness and contrast adjusted individually for clarity and aesthetics using ImageJ (NIH; Schneider et al., 2012 49. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (42399) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To generate the Actin::mCherry plasmid used to establish transgenesis, codon-optimized mCherry cDNA was designed using COOL ( Yu et al., 2017 60. Yu, K. ∙ Ang, K.S. ∙ Lee, D.-Y. Synthetic gene design using codon optimization on-line (COOL) Hughes, R.A. (Editor) Synthetic DNA: Methods and Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology Springer, 2017; 13-34 Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar ). The ACT2 promoter was cloned from upstream of a non-muscle actin gene (XLOC_011689) using primers: TTTGCTGCGTACAACAACAACGACC and TCGACTTATGTCCTGATAGTTCGGA. The 3′UTR used in all constructs was from a different actin gene (XLOC_021750) and was amplified using primers: CCAACAGATGTGGATCTCCAAACA and ACTGGAAGCCTGAGTTCCATCAAA. This was assembled into the pT2AL200R150G backbone ( Urasaki et al., 2006 55. Urasaki, A. ∙ Morvan, G. ∙ Kawakami, K. Functional Dissection of the Tol2 Transposable Element Identified the Minimal cis-Sequence and a Highly Repetitive Sequence in the Subterminal Region Essential for Transposition Genetics. 2006; 174 :639-649 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar ; licensed under MTA - N° K2010-008).
Other Clytia transgenesis constructs were based on the miniTol2 backbone, a gift from Dr. Stephen Ekker (Addgene plasmid # 31829). To generate RFamide::NTR-2A-mCherry, the RFamide (XLOC_019434) fragment was amplified from Clytia genomic DNA using the following primers, ATCCCCATCCGCCATCTTTG, GTTGTGTTCTTTCTTGATTTGATGG, and inserted into the miniTol2 backbone using In-Fusion Cloning (Takara). This miniTol2-RFamide backbone was then used to insert different effectors, always using In-Fusion Cloning, following digestion with Spe1. To generate RFamide::NTR-2A-mCherry and RFamide::GCaMP6s-2A-mCherry: epNTR was amplified from the pCS2-epNTR plasmid, a gift from Dr. Harold Burgess (Addgene plasmid # 62213); both GCaMP6s and the 2A peptide used in this paper was derived from AAV-hSyn1-GCaMP6s-P2A-nls-dTomato, a gift from Jonathan Ting (Addgene plasmid # 51084).
In order to establish and optimize transgenesis, we first used the actin promoter (see Cloning), which we found to drive strong, widespread expression in planula and in polyp tentacles. This enabled accurate estimates of efficiency during the critical early life stages following injection ( Figure S1 H). Using Actin-mCherry to test strategies, we established a protocol that now enables routine, efficient transgenesis, using microinjection of Tol2 transposase protein together with circular plasmid DNA into unfertilized eggs. Collection of eggs and sperm, and microinjection, was carried out as previously described ( Momose et al., 2018 38. Momose, T. ∙ Cian, A.D. ∙ Shiba, K. ... High doses of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein efficiently induce gene knockout with low mosaicism in the hydrozoan Clytia hemisphaerica through microhomology-mediated deletion Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :11734 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Clytia medusa spawn ∼2 hours after the onset of light. In order to collect eggs and sperm, animals were transferred into either dishes (for the females) or 6-well plates (for the males) within the first hour of light onset. After spawning, eggs were immediately collected and injected with a mixture of 6.25ng/μl Tol2 transposase protein and 10ng/μl plasmid DNA using a Femtojet (Eppendorf). Pulled glass capillaries were used for microinjection (WPI, TW100F-4). Rather than use the ‘inject’ function on the Femtojet, injections were carried out by puncturing eggs and allowing the backpressure in the capillary to fill to the desired volume (∼1/4-1/3 egg diameter). Tol2 protein was produced by Creative Biomart using a plasmid generously provided by Dr. Stephen Ekker ( Ni et al., 2016 41. Ni, J. ∙ Wangensteen, K.J. ∙ Nelsen, D. ... Active recombinant Tol2 transposase for gene transfer and gene discovery applications Mob. DNA. 2016; 7 :6 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Protein was then stored at −80°C as 5μl aliquots and thawed directly prior to injection.
Immediately following injection – and within an hour of spawning (i.e., 3h after light onset) – eggs were fertilized and allowed to develop overnight into planula larvae. They were then transferred into a 12-well plate of artificial sea water containing penicillin/streptomycin, which prevents early metamorphosis of the planulae into polyps. On the second day following injection, we checked the expression of plasmids in the planulae under a fluorescent microscope to ensure that they were capable of driving sufficient expression. Importantly, at this stage expression is not dependent on integration. Planulae were then induced to metamorphose into primary polyps onto glass slides (Ted Pella, cat #260439) using a synthetic GLWamide neuropeptide (produced by Genscript; see Lechable et al. [2020 28. Lechable, M. ∙ Jan, A. ∙ Duchene, A. ... An improved whole life cycle culture protocol for the hydrozoan genetic model Clytia hemisphaerica Biol. Open. 2020; 9 :bio051268 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ] for details on culturing across the life cycle).
Primary polyps were hand-fed mashed shrimp until they began to grow into a colony. Mashed shrimp were generated by drawing brine shrimp into a 10ml syringe with a blunt-tipped needle attached and then expelling them while pressing the end of the needle against the bottom of a small dish or beaker. Once colonies had 3 or more polyps, they were screened for transgenic expression, with all but the most highly and broadly expressing polyp colonies removed. These colonies were then allowed to grow until they began releasing jellyfish. Jellyfish were then collected, raised to maturity, and backcrossed to parental strains in order to generate stable F 1 colonies (see “ Experimental model and subject details ” section, above). F 1 s were seeded sparsely on slides, and were screened for several criteria: strong expression of the transgene, strong polyp colony growth and health, and the ability to release healthy jellyfish that were able to reach maturity. F 1 colonies were maintained as single clonal colonies per slide, and once the best colony was identified, the rest were thrown away and that colony was expanded. This allows for the same genetic background to be used across experiments, as these colonies then release clonal experimental jellyfish as needed.
Most behavioral analysis was carried out on videos acquired through an Olympus stereoscope (SZX2). Videos were manually annotated using the BENTO analysis suite ( https://github.com/neuroethology/bentoMAT ) ( Segalin et al., 2020 51. Segalin, C. ∙ Williams, J. ∙ Karigo, T. ... The Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS): a software pipeline for automated analysis of social behaviors in mice bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The exceptions were videos for tracking the major and minor axis ( Figures 3 F–3I), and for NTR swimming controls ( Figures S2 A–S2C), both of which used a white LED tracing pad as a backlight rather than the stereoscope (Amazon ASIN# B01M26S3VY) and used automated rather than manual tracking (see below). All videos were acquired using Flea3 or Grasshopper USB3 cameras from FLIR, and the manufacturer’s acquisition software (FlyCapture).
Mouth pointing shown in Figures 3 B and 3C was assayed by pinning animals to sylgard-coated plates (Dow Corning) using stainless steel minutien pins (Fine Science Tools). This prevented the margin from getting close to the mouth during a folding event, which would have the potential confound of causing directional mouth pointing by direct sensory stimulation of the mouth. The subumbrella was then wounded only on the right side of the animal to compare pointing in the intact ( Figure 3 B) versus the wounded ( Figure 3 C) direction. Having the internal control of the wounded direction ruled out the possibility that the mouth and margin were responding to a shared, directional sensory stimulus, or that the folding of the margin itself was a directional sensory stimulus for the mouth (e.g., by creating fluid flow). Videos were acquired at 15fps, and mouth pointing events 30 s before and after a margin folding event were manually annotated using these videos. If the mouth was leaning in one direction at the start of the epoch, that lean was treated as a baseline for further pointing. All margin folding events were spontaneous (i.e., no stimuli were delivered) to avoid possible shared, directional sensory stimulation of the margin and mouth.
Shrimp extract used in all stimulation experiments was generated by homogenizing brine shrimp using a syringe with a blunt tipped needle followed by filtration through a 40μm cell strainer. Experiments used either this 40μm filtered extract, or extract that was passed through an additional 0.2μm filter. Mechanical stimuli in Figure S2 J was delivered by gently touching the tentacles and margin using a glass Pasteur pipette. For experiments in which shrimp extract was used to trigger behavior in freely moving animals, animals were transferred into 6-well plates and 20μl of 40μm filtered shrimp extract was added to the well.
Shown in Figure 3 . Animals were pinned to sylgard plates, as described above for mouth pointing experiments. ∼5μl of 0.2μm filtered shrimp extract was then pipetted directly onto either the top, bottom, left, or right portion of the margin. The timing of margin folding events from all quadrants, and the locations of sensory stimulation, were then manually annotated and compared. For physical ablation experiments, body parts were cut off using spring scissors (Fine Science Tools) or, to remove the mouth, by creating hole-punches using a blunt-tipped needle.
Automated behavior tracking of the major and minor axes, shown in Figure 3 , was performed using custom MATLAB (Mathworks) software. Briefly, following background subtraction, a convex hull was found around the dark pixels using the “regionprops” function, and the major and minor axes of the hull were extracted. To achieve high quality tracking, tentacles were trimmed and jellyfish were pinned to sylgard coated plates (Dow Corning) using a single stainless steel minutien pin (Fine Science Tools) through the mouth. This maintained their orientation relative to the camera. To behaviorally distinguish swimming from spontaneous margin-folding, we created binary classifiers using the length of the major and minor axes of jellyfish and the ratio between these measurements. Support vector machines (SVMs) with linear kernels were trained using these three features on equal samples of video frames where animals were either swimming or performing spontaneous margin-folding behavior, using cross-validation from data across animals. Classifier performance is reported as the average model accuracy across validation folds. Chance level performance was obtained by shuffling the identities of swimming and margin-folding behavioral frames before forming the same analysis. To assess the similarity between different forms of margin-folding, we tested the performance of SVMs trained to distinguish swimming versus spontaneous margin-folding on margin-folding triggered by either shrimp extract or live shrimp (versus swimming), using the same features of tracking data.
Shown in Figure 3 . Jellyfish were split into two cohorts in the morning and one cohort was fed ad libitum during the day while the other was not (∼24h starvation). Animals were then split into the wells of 6 well plates and passing times individually tested by manually placing shrimp in their tentacles. For comparison of animals during versus after spawning, jellyfish spawn ∼2h after the onset of light. Mature medusa were recorded from ∼1h50min-2h after light onset, and the number of spontaneous folding events was manually quantified. Egg release could be observed in each of the experimental animals.
Shown in Figure S2 L: animals were fed many shrimp simultaneously such that most tentacles captured a shrimp nearly simultaneously. The time and direction of folding onset was then manually recorded for each, distinct shrimp passing event until most shrimp had been passed. A behavior-triggered average was then performed for each folding direction versus folding from any other region. These comparisons were then combined across folding directions.
Animals were incubated overnight in 10mM Metronidazole (Fisher, cat# ICN15571005) ( Curado et al., 2008 10. Curado, S. ∙ Stainier, D.Y.R. ∙ Anderson, R.M. Nitroreductase-mediated cell/tissue ablation in zebrafish: a spatially and temporally controlled ablation method with applications in developmental and regeneration studies Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3 :948-954 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following morning, animals were washed several times in clean artificial sea water and behavioral testing was performed on the same day. For crumpling behavior, the subumbrella was gently poked with a glass pipette and crumpling duration was manually quantified. For control experiments shown in Figure S2 , automated behavior tracking was performed as above, with the centroid of the convex hull used to calculate location, velocity, and turning angle.
The RFamide peptide (QWLNGRF-amide) and scrambled-sequence control (FRGNLWQ-amide) used in Figures S2 and S3 were synthesized by Genscript and bath applied to a final concentration of 100μm, or injected at 100μm.
For highly restrained imaging experiments, ∼4mm Clytia medusa were embedded in agarose, as follows. 3%–4%, Type VII-A, low-melting point agarose (Sigma cat# A0701-25G) was first made in artificial sea water, with particular care to avoid evaporation. Agarose was then aliquoted and kept in a heat block set at 50-degrees until ready to use in screw-top tubes. Single tubes were then removed from the heat block and vortexed occasionally until reaching nearly room temperature. Medusa were then added into the tube, gently mixed, and rapidly transferred to a glass-bottomed dish (Ted Pella, 14036-20). They were then quickly spread out to make them as planar as possible before being briefly touched to a cold object to rapidly cool and harden the agarose. Agarose was then covered with a thin layer of mineral oil (Sigma M5310-1L) to avoid evaporation during imaging experiments. Following agarose embedding we observed a spectrum of animal restraint. This could be controlled, to a degree, by the extent of mixing of the jellyfish in the agarose prior to transferring to a glass bottom dish. The most well restrained animals were chosen for the analyses shown in Figure 5 . Experiments in which both behavior and GCaMP traces could be analyzed, shown in Figure 4 , were from animals in which agarose embedding was performed but significant freedom of movement was still visible. Having acquired videos, we then retrospectively chose animals that had the highest possible movement while still allowing extraction of traces by circling ROIs (see below). There was consistently a relatively small portion of the animal in the field of view in these experiments. For imaging experiments in naturalistically behaving jellyfish, animals were placed into a glass depression slide, and a coverslip was gently placed on top, using small amounts of Vaseline applied to each corner of the coverslip as a spacer. The coverslip was then gently pressed down to create a small chamber in which the jellyfish could still perform behaviors. Since the curvature of the jellyfish in the preparation prevented the entire animal from being in focus, the nerve net nearest to the mouth was focused on (rings and ring-adjacent net were out of focus and not measured). Chambers of this type were also used for peptide application during GCaMP imaging ( Figure S3 ) and for application of shrimp extract to pieces of the ring or net ( Figure S5 D). In those experiments, flow-through was achieved using a Kimwipe (Kimberly-Clark Professional) applied to the edge of the coverslip.
GCaMP imaging experiments always had synchronous acquisition of the red and green channels. This was achieved using an Olympus BX51WI microscope with two Photometrics Prime95B cameras connected using a W-View Gemini-2 Optical Splitter from Hamamatsu. Acquisition was controlled with Olympus Cellsens software. Images were acquired with downsampling during acquisition (to 600x600 pixels) and then further processed using ImageJ software, as follows (NIH) ( Schneider et al., 2012 49. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (42399) PubMed Google Scholar ) . First, images were re-sized to 400x400 pixels. An average Z-projection was then performed, and each frame in the video stack was divided by this projection to generate a normalized intensity over time for each pixel. If needed, a spatial filter was applied using ImageJ’s Bandpass Filter function to remove spatial light artifacts, e.g., from movement of the mouth, with custom parameters tuned to each video. Regions of Interest (ROIs) were then circled using the ImageJ ROI Manager, and the average pixel intensity within, and location of, these ROIs was then exported for further processing using MATLAB (Mathworks). Signal from both the red and green channels were acquired simultaneously using two cameras in all experiments. We then could use the same ROIs as were used to extract GCaMP traces to extract fluorescence over time from the red channel to ensure that our downstream analyses are not the result of imaging or motion artifacts. Running the same analysis pipeline on traces extracted from the red channel did not result in correlated activity structure, shown in Figure S4 K. Red channel traces were not directly used for normalization of the GCaMP traces.
The raw traces, behavior-triggered averages, and behavior classifiers shown in Figure 4 , and the relationship between ring and net neurons shown in Figure 5 O, were computed using smoothed and z-scored GCaMP traces. For event-based analyses in Figures 5 and 6 , and for computing correlation between neurons (where long-timescale GCaMP fluorescence changes affect results), we instead inferred peak times of neuronal events, and performed analyses on these inferred peaks to remove the effects of underlying noise or drift in the raw trace. Peaks were detected in one of two ways: either using MATLAB’s “findpeaks” function or using spike inference from the CNMF_E software package ( Zhou et al., 2018 61. Zhou, P. ∙ Resendez, S.L. ∙ Rodriguez-Romaguera, J. ... Efficient and accurate extraction of in vivo calcium signals from microendoscopic video data eLife. 2018; 7 :e28728 Crossref Scopus (321) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters manually adjusted for each trace, and inferred events manually validated. Following spike detection, the first spike in a bout of inferred spikes was used as the timing of the activity. For computing correlation between neurons, events were smoothed by sequential convolution with box filters of width 3 s and 1.5 s. A value of “1” was then added back in at the time of the inferred peak.
Optical flow analysis shown in Figure S3 was performed using the Horn-Schunck method (MATLAB function opticalFlowHS, default parameters) applied to cropped video frames of the nerve ring in the red channel. For Figure S3 , we trained a classifier to distinguish video frames of manually annotated behaviors from all other frames in a trial, where input to the classifier was the mean orientation and magnitude of the optic flow vectors for each frame. We used a binary boosted decision tree classifier, trained using the LogitBoost algorithm with cross-validation. Classifier performance is reported as the average model accuracy across validation folds for each animal.
Classifier analysis comparing GCaMP to behavior was performed in MATLAB. Given a set of GCaMP traces, we used the first 1500 frames for training and held the remaining frames out for testing; this ranged from 15%–36% of the data in the training set, depending on the length of the recording. We trained a 3-way, Random Forest classifier with 60 bags, and used out-of-bag prediction to distinguish between epochs of margin folding, swimming, and quiescence.
For the loosely-restrained experiments in Figure 4 , and imaging-with-stimulation experiments shown in Figure S5 , neurons that responded to the stimulus and body shape were manually annotated using the ImageJ ROI Manager, and Adobe Illustrator, by comparing the fluorescence intensity of neurons on a frame before initiation of a folding event to a frame during the folding event ( Figures 4 I and S3 H). To generate a polar histogram of margin folding directions ( Figure 4 ), we defined the folding axis as the line between the mouth and the center of the inward fold, and calculated the angular position of active neurons relative to this axis.
In Figure 5 , we asked what fraction of variance in spontaneous neural activity could be explained by activation of a small, fixed number of neural ensembles. First, we defined a population event as more than 2 neurons being active (using the single frame of peak detection, described above) within a 2 s window, and generated a matrix of neuronal participation in all observed ensembles for each animal. To identify a set of fixed neural ensembles, we performed k-means clustering on this matrix; we tested a range of values of k, and used the silhouette metric to pick the value of k that best captured the observed data. For each animal, we then generated a set of all possible combinations of up to 4 ensembles being coactive. For each observed event from that animal, we found the generated pattern of k-means cluster activation that minimized the Hamming distance between the observed activation and the cluster-based activation. This yielded a new matrix of events recreated using k-means clusters (shown in Figure 5 H), which was compared to the observed events matrix to generate the F1 scores in Figure 5 I.
While k-means clustering requires each cell to only be counted as a member of a single ensemble, we also wanted to visualize predicted ensemble membership if we allowed a cell to be part of more than one ensemble. Our method for detection of cell ensembles using NMF/ICA was based on a method described in Lopes-dos-Santos et al. (2013) 31. Lopes-dos-Santos, V. ∙ Ribeiro, S. ∙ Tort, A.B.L. Detecting cell assemblies in large neuronal populations J. Neurosci. Methods. 2013; 220 :149-166 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar and used in See et al. (2018) 50. See, J.Z. ∙ Atencio, C.A. ∙ Sohal, V.S. ... Coordinated neuronal ensembles in primary auditory cortical columns eLife. 2018; 7 :e35587 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar . To determine the number of ensembles in each jellyfish, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to data, processed as described above (i.e., extracted and smoothed peak times), to obtain the eigenvalue spectrum. Eigenvalues that exceed the upper bounds of the Marčenko-Pastur distribution ( Marčenko and Pastur, 1967 35. Marčenko, V.A. ∙ Pastur, L.A. Distribution of Eigenvalues for Some Sets of Random Matrices Math. USSR Sb. 1967; 1 :457-483 Crossref Google Scholar ) were deemed significant and taken to represent the number of detected ensembles. We determined this bound using a statistical threshold based on surrogate data, obtained as follows. First, we shuffled the time bins of each neuron independently in order to destroy their temporal relations while maintaining the distribution of events. Second, we used the eigenvalues of correlation matrices obtain from shuffled data to construct a null distribution. We regarded as significant all eigenvalues of the original data matrix that were larger than the 99th percentile of the distribution of maximal eigenvalues computed from shuffled data ( Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013 31. Lopes-dos-Santos, V. ∙ Ribeiro, S. ∙ Tort, A.B.L. Detecting cell assemblies in large neuronal populations J. Neurosci. Methods. 2013; 220 :149-166 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Having identified the number of significant eigenvalues, we next used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to optimize the number of factors used for ensemble detection, so that the maximal number of overall neurons could be included in any ensemble. The resulting factors from NMF were then processed using the fast independent component analysis (fastICA) algorithm ( Hyvärinen and Oja, 1997 21. Hyvärinen, A. ∙ Oja, E. A Fast Fixed-Point Algorithm for Independent Component Analysis Neural Comput. 1997; 9 :1483-1492 Crossref Scopus (2906) Google Scholar ). The resulting independent components (ICs) represent the contribution of each neuron to each ensemble. We validated ensemble membership by applying the NMF/ICA method on shuffled data described above. This process was performed 100 times to obtain a normal distribution of IC weights for shuffled data. A neuron was considered a member of an ensemble if its IC weight was larger than 2 times the standard deviation of the IC weight distribution from shuffled data. With this cutoff, 79% of neurons were assigned to one or more ensembles.
For analysis of the timing of ring versus net activity, we first manually extracted groups of net neurons and their spatially corresponding, highly correlated ring neurons. We then identified events of nerve net activity for each group using the mean activity of net neurons by extracting the time when the mean crossed a threshold (z-score > 1.5, followed by manual validation). We then examined the timing of individual ring and net neuron activity relative to this onset. To quantify the relative onset time within these “net-triggered averages,” any neuron in the ring or net within the same group that crossed a threshold of z-score > 1.5 within 5 s before, or 10 s after, the identified net onset was included, and that time to crossing was used for comparison.
For the wounding experiments in Figure 5 P, wounds were generated in the subumbrella using either a scalpel or forceps, and the number of events on each side of the wound was quantified. Mock wounds were unwounded regions in similar locations; a line was drawn on the video after acquisition using ImageJ, and the number of events on either side of the line was quantified.
To examine whether the structure of neural activity was similar during spontaneous and evoked events, we used an approach that compares the neural subspace occupied during two conditions ( Elsayed et al., 2016 14. Elsayed, G.F. ∙ Lara, A.H. ∙ Kaufman, M.T. ... Reorganization between preparatory and movement population responses in motor cortex Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13239 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yoo and Hayden, 2020 59. Yoo, S.B.M. ∙ Hayden, B.Y. The Transition from Evaluation to Selection Involves Neural Subspace Reorganization in Core Reward Regions Neuron. 2020; 105 :712-724.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first performed PCA separately on the neurons by time matrix of smoothed events observed during each condition; we kept the top 5 principal components (PCs) in each condition, as we found that these captured over 80% of the variance of observed neural activity within a given condition. Next, we computed the similarity between spontaneous and evoked conditions, by projecting the matrix of raw evoked activity onto the top 5 PCs of the spontaneous condition, and computing the percent of variance captured by these 5 PCs relative to the total variance of the evoked epoch (and vice versa, projecting raw spontaneous activity onto the PCs of the evoked condition). Finally, we computed the alignment index ( A ) between conditions, defined as the ratio of the amount of variance in a condition explained by the top 5 PCs of the opposing condition, divided by the amount variance in a condition explained by its own top 5 PCs. For example, for the evoked condition, this can be written as: 𝐴 = 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝐷 𝑇 S p o n t a n e o u s ⁢ 𝐶 E v o k e d ⁢ 𝐷 S p o n t a n e o u s ) ∑ 5 𝑖 = 1 𝜎 E v o k e d ⁡ ( 𝑖 ) Where Tr() is the matrix trace, D Spontaneous is the set of top 5 eigenvectors obtained by PCA in the spontaneous condition. C evoked is the covariance matrix of the evoked condition, and σ evoked (i) is the i-th singular value of C evoked . Since the quantity in the denominator serves to normalize the alignment index, it ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect orthogonality between the subspaces and 1 indicating perfect alignment.
To obtain a statistical comparison, we generated random subspaces biased to the data covariance structure as described in Elsayed et al. (2016) 14. Elsayed, G.F. ∙ Lara, A.H. ∙ Kaufman, M.T. ... Reorganization between preparatory and movement population responses in motor cortex Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13239 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar . This was performed as a Monte-Carlo analysis applied to the covariance structure ( C ) from neural responses across all times (both spontaneous and evoked conditions). Random subspaces aligned to the structure of C are obtained as: 𝑉 a l i g n = 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ ⁡ ( 𝑈 ⁢ √ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑉 ‖ 𝑈 ⁢ √ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑉 ‖ 2 ) Where U and S are eigenvectors and eigenvalues of C respectively. V is a matrix with each element drawn independently from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. Orth(Z) returns the orthonormal basis for a matrix Z . Thus, this procedure samples subspaces biased toward the space of neural activity, such that the sampled subspace will have the specified covariance matrix C . To calculate the alignment index of two sets of random subspaces ( 𝑉 ( 𝑖 ) a l i g n and 𝑉 ( 𝑗 ) a l i g n ) of dimension d = 5, we calculate: T r ⁡ ( V ( 𝑗 ) 𝑇 a l i g n ⁢ V ( 𝑖 ) a l i g n ⁢ V ( 𝑖 ) 𝑇 a l i g n ⁢ V ( 𝑗 ) a l i g n ) 𝑑 We repeat the random sampling procedure 1000 times to obtain a distribution of random alignment matrices for each jellyfish.
To infer functional connectivity between neurons in the spontaneous epoch ( Mishchenko et al., 2011 37. Mishchenko, Y. ∙ Vogelstein, J.T. ∙ Paninski, L. A Bayesian approach for inferring neuronal connectivity from calcium fluorescent imaging data Ann. Appl. Stat. 2011; 5 :1229-1261 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ; Pillow et al., 2008 43. Pillow, J.W. ∙ Shlens, J. ∙ Paninski, L. ... Spatio-temporal correlations and visual signalling in a complete neuronal population Nature. 2008; 454 :995-999 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ), we fit Gaussian-residual GLMs for each neuron k using data from spontaneous epochs as: 𝑦 𝑘 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⁢ 𝛽 + 𝜑 Where y i is the activity of target neuron k, X is the matrix of activity of all other neurons in a given jellyfish, β is a vector of coefficient weights (which can be interpreted as a proxy of the connectivity of all other neurons to neuron k ), and φ is an error term. We regularized our model with an additional non-negativity constraint to impose sparseness and non-negativity on model weights β, implemented using a non-negative least angle regression of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) ( Efron et al., 2004 13. Efron, B. ∙ Hastie, T. ∙ Johnstone, I. ... Least angle regression Ann. Stat. 2004; 32 :407-499 Crossref Scopus (6741) Google Scholar ) with the sparseness parameter determined using 10-fold cross validation. We found, however, that the sparseness that we found in the connectivity did not ultimately depend on the LASSO regularization (see below).
To assess whether data from the evoked epoch could be predicted using model weights found from the spontaneous epoch, we evaluated model performance of GLMs for each cell using held-out test data from the evoked epoch. Model performance in Figure 6 F is measured using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) between predicted activity and ground truth evoked epoch data. For the results shown in Figure 7 , GLMs were additionally trained on the recordings shown in Figure 5 to examine the connectivity matrix obtained from model weights. These recordings were longer and had more of the jellyfish in the field of view as compared to the more complex sensory stimulation experiments. For this, we used the same GLM described above but assessed model performance on held-out test data from the same spontaneous epoch (rather than comparing to an evoked epoch), reporting model fit as the PCC between predicted activity and ground truth data. Model weights from GLMs of cells with a model fit R 2 of at least 0.7 were used to construct the connectivity matrix in Figure 7 E.
To examine the impact of LASSO regularization, which enforces sparsity, on sparsity of the connectivity matrix obtained, we retrained our models using elastic-net regularization. To predict the activity of a given neuron (y) from the activity of all other neurons simultaneously recorded (X), using weights (w), we created a GLM by maximizing the log-likelihood of y, X given W as shown below: l o g ⁡ 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑦 , 𝑋 | 𝑤 ) − 𝜆 ⁡ [ ( 1 − 𝛼 ) ⁢ ∑ 𝑤 2 𝑖 + 𝛼 ⁢ ∑ | 𝑤 | 𝑖 ] (1.1) In the above Equation 1.1 , the highlighted components indicate the ridge and lasso terms in elastic net regularization. To assess the impact of the lasso term on sparsity generated in our model, we varied the term α in range [0 - 1] in 0.2 increments and quantified sparsity in our model as the percent of matrix elements with zero weights.
To ask what forms of network architecture were consistent with the statistics of observed spontaneous population events, we simulated events in a model network of stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We created a population of 500 model neurons, of which 250 were designated “ring” neurons and 250 “net” neurons; neurons were assigned evenly spaced angular positions around the model jellyfish. We assumed that a spontaneous event is initiated by a burst of spiking of a single ring neuron, which we randomly selected from among the model population. We then simulated propagation of this activity throughout the remainder of the model population, as follows. For each neuron, the membrane potential x evolves as: 𝑥 = t a n h ⁡ ( ∑ 𝑗 𝑊 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 ⁢ 𝑝 𝑗 ) where W is a matrix of synaptic weights between neurons (defined below) and p j is a synaptic current from neuron j that decays exponentially with time constant τ = 0.2 s. We implemented stochasticity in neuron spiking by setting p j (t) = 1 if U < x j (t), 0 otherwise , where U is sampled uniformly from 0 to 1.
We simulated population dynamics for 3 forms of the weight matrix W: one in which connection strength was proportional to angular distance between neurons (“continuous” or “nerve net” model), one in which blocks of neurons were all connected with equal strength (“distinct structures”), and a hybrid model that was the weighted sum of the two. In all models, we allowed connections between ring neurons, between net neurons, and from ring neurons to net neurons. In the continuous model , we defined 𝑊 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 = 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝐷 2 / 2 ⁢ 𝜎 2 , where D is the angular distance between neurons i and j , and A and σ are fit parameters determining connection strength and the width of connectivity respectively. In the “distinct structures” model, we defined W ij = A if neurons i and j were assigned to the same group using k-means clustering, and 0 otherwise; A is again a fit parameter determining connection strength. Finally, in the hybrid model , we defined 𝑊 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 = 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑊 c o n t i n u o u s 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 + ( 1 − 𝑔 ) ⁢ 𝑊 d i s t i n c t 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 , where W ij continuous is the weight matrix of the continuous model, W ij distinct is the weight matrix of the “distinct structures” model, and g is a scalar between 0 and 1.
In the continuous version of the model, we fit weight matrix parameters A and σ, whereas in the distinct structures model we fit only parameter A; in the hybrid model, we fit A, σ, and g. In all cases, parameters A and σ were fit using a grid search, to minimize the sum of two Kolmogorov-Smirnov distances: the distance between the predicted and observed distribution of event angular extents, and the distance between distributions of number of active neurons per event (see next sections). For the hybrid model, we computed best-fit values of A and σ for g = {0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875}. All values of g were able to fit the distributions of event widths and fraction of activated cells well; g = 0.125 and 0.75 are shown in Figure S6 to compare predicted correlation matrices.
To evaluate model performance and fit model parameters, we computed two metrics on a sample of simulated model events; for each jellyfish, we generate an equal number of events as was observed experimentally, and averaged metric values across 5 repeated instantiations of the model. First, we calculated the distribution of event widths. Defining an event as a time when at least 2 (real or model) neurons were active, we computed the width of each event as the maximum angular distance between any two neurons active in that event. And second, we calculated the distribution of the fraction of cells activated, defined as the percentage of cells that participated in each event. To compare the distributions of observed and simulated events, we computed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, defined as the maximum difference between the cumulative density function of the two distributions.
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad) or MATLAB. The n number for each experiment is indicated in the figure legends, along with the statistical method used for each comparison and the p value. The cutoff for significance was set as an α < 0.05. Quantification strategies for each experiment and modeling approach are separately described above ( Method details ).
