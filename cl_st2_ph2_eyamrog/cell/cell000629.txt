Title: Structural mechanisms of GABA A receptor autoimmune encephalitis


Abstract: Summary

Autoantibodies targeting neuronal membrane proteins can cause encephalitis, seizures, and severe behavioral abnormalities. While antibodies for several neuronal targets have been identified, structural details on how they regulate function are unknown. Here we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of antibodies derived from an encephalitis patient bound to the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) receptor. These antibodies induced severe encephalitis by directly inhibiting GABA A function, resulting in nervous-system hyperexcitability. The structures reveal mechanisms of GABA A inhibition and pathology. One antibody directly competes with a neurotransmitter and locks the receptor in a resting-like state. The second antibody targets the subunit interface involved in binding benzodiazepines and antagonizes diazepam potentiation. We identify key residues in these antibodies involved in specificity and affinity and confirm structure-based hypotheses for functional effects using electrophysiology. Together these studies define mechanisms of direct functional antagonism of neurotransmission underlying autoimmune encephalitis in a human patient.

Section: Introduction

Autoimmunity arises when the body’s T cells or antibodies attack self-antigens. The trigger for this improper immune response can be environmental, such as a virus, or internal, such as a tumor. The consequences of autoimmune disease can be short-lived and self-resolving or can become chronic and debilitating and eventually lead to death. Autoantibodies targeting a variety of tissues have been investigated for decades ( 1988 1. Autoimmune thyroid disease and thyroid antibodies Lancet. 1988; 1 :1261-1262 PubMed Google Scholar ; Obermayer-Straub et al., 2000 34. Obermayer-Straub, P. ∙ Strassburg, C.P. ∙ Manns, M.P. Autoimmune hepatitis J. Hepatol. 2000; 32 :181-197 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the study of neuropsychological disorders directly mediated by anti-neuronal antibodies is in its infancy. The first case of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was described in 2007 ( Dalmau et al., 2007 10. Dalmau, J. ∙ Tüzün, E. ∙ Wu, H.Y. ... Paraneoplastic anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma Ann. Neurol. 2007; 61 :25-36 Crossref Scopus (2087) PubMed Google Scholar ) and represents one entity in the rapidly growing disease category of autoimmune encephalitis ( Prüss, 2021 37. Prüss, H. Autoantibodies in neurological disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21 :798-813 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autoimmune encephalitis is characterized by severe and acute-onset symptoms comprising psychosis, refractory seizures, movement disorders, impaired consciousness, and dysautonomia. Established antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from affected patients can now be routinely detected in cell-based assays overexpressing the respective proteins. Novel clinically relevant antibodies are continuously discovered, and the antigenic targets are identified using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Anti-neuronal targets associated with pathological disease include ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, Leucine-rich Glioma Inactivated 1 (LGI1), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR-2), dopamine receptors, and ionotropic and metabotropic γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABA A and GABA B , respectively) ( Dalmau and Graus, 2018 9. Dalmau, J. ∙ Graus, F. Antibody-mediated encephalitis N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :840-851 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Prüss, 2021 37. Prüss, H. Autoantibodies in neurological disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21 :798-813 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ).
GABA A receptors are part of the greater Cys-loop receptor family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The GABA A receptors form anion-selective channels and generally act to dampen neuronal excitability. They are usually heteromeric, assembling from a panel of 19 subunits. The most common isoform at synapses comprises two α1 subunits, two β subunits, and one γ2 subunit ( Nutt and Malizia, 2001 33. Nutt, D.J. ∙ Malizia, A.L. New insights into the role of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor in psychiatric disorder Br. J. Psychiatry. 2001; 179 :390-396 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 ). Each subunit is positioned symmetrically or pseudo-symmetrically around the axis of the ion pore. The neurotransmitter GABA binds in the extracellular domain (ECD) at β-α subunit interfaces. This binding triggers conformational changes that open an ion channel formed by the second helix (M2) of the transmembrane domain (TMD). In the sustained presence of agonist, the channel adopts a non-conducting desensitized state ( Gielen and Corringer, 2018 13. Gielen, M. ∙ Corringer, P.J. The dual-gate model for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels activation and desensitization J. Physiol. 2018; 596 :1873-1902 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). When GABA concentrations decrease, GABA dissociates and the channel returns to the resting, activatable state. Impeding this inhibitory receptor leads to nervous system hyperexcitability, which can result in anxiety, seizures, catatonia, and death. These ends may be achieved through receptor internalization or through stabilizing one of the closed-channel states.
As with other autoimmune encephalitides, target identification of the GABA A receptor is the essential starting point for understanding, diagnosing, and treating disease ( Petit-Pedrol et al., 2014 35. Petit-Pedrol, M. ∙ Armangue, T. ∙ Peng, X. ... Encephalitis with refractory seizures, status epilepticus, and antibodies to the GABAA receptor: a case series, characterisation of the antigen, and analysis of the effects of antibodies Lancet Neurol. 2014; 13 :276-286 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it reveals little about how the improper immune response causes pathology. For different forms of autoimmune encephalitis, the mechanism of the autoantibodies’ pathogenicity is mainly attributed to target receptor clustering and internalization ( Dalmau et al., 2017 8. Dalmau, J. ∙ Geis, C. ∙ Graus, F. Autoantibodies to synaptic receptors and neuronal cell surface proteins in autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system Physiol. Rev. 2017; 97 :839-887 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Direct autoantibody effects on neuronal function have only recently been appreciated ( Crisp et al., 2019 7. Crisp, S.J. ∙ Dixon, C.L. ∙ Jacobson, L. ... Glycine receptor autoantibodies disrupt inhibitory neurotransmission Brain. 2019; 142 :3398-3410 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Isolation of monoclonal antibodies from the CSF of an 8-year-old encephalitis patient identified at least two different autoantibodies that cause seizures and status epilepticus in the absence of receptor internalization ( Kreye et al., 2021 21. Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we use structural biology to reveal the pathogenic mechanisms of these patient-derived anti-neuronal antibodies bound to their physiological target, the GABA A receptor.

Section: Results

We tested a panel of five patient-derived antibodies ( Kreye et al., 2021 21. Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) for binding to the purified α1β2γ2 GABA A receptor ( Figure S1 ). Purified monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were first screened for receptor binding by fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) ( Kawate and Gouaux, 2006 16. Kawate, T. ∙ Gouaux, E. Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography for precrystallization screening of integral membrane proteins Structure. 2006; 14 :673-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ). This assay detected binding by all antibodies tested except for mAb 198 ( Figure S1 A). Fab fragments were then generated from antibodies mAb 101 , mAb 115 , mAb 175 , and mAb 201 for structural studies. Binding stoichiometries were estimated by FSEC with increasing molar ratios of Fab to receptor ( Figures S1 B–S1E), and reactivity to native receptors was analyzed in murine brain tissues ( Figure S1 F) before large-scale complex formation and purification. Fab 201 failed to bind detectably to the GABA A receptor and was excluded from structural studies. Fab 101 no longer bound the GABA A receptor with an affinity suitable for structural work; it may require bivalency to bind appreciably. We thus pursued both Fab 115 and Fab 175 in structural studies.
In contrast to mechanisms of autoantibody-induced neurological disease described thus far ( Hughes et al., 2010 14. Hughes, E.G. ∙ Peng, X. ∙ Gleichman, A.J. ... Cellular and synaptic mechanisms of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis J. Neurosci. 2010; 30 :5866-5875 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kreye et al., 2016 20.

Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). We were intrigued by this phenomenon and sought to understand its mechanism of inhibition by obtaining the structure of Fab 115 bound to the GABA A receptor. We purified the α1β2γ2 synaptic GABA A receptor and reconstituted it into brain lipid nanodiscs ( Kim et al., 2020 17. Kim, J.J. ∙ Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ... Shared structural mechanisms of general anaesthetics and benzodiazepines Nature. 2020; 585 :303-308 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reconstituted receptors were incubated with Fab 115 before further polishing by size-exclusion chromatography ( Figures S1 G and S1H). We applied the purified complex to cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) grids and collected a dataset that allowed us to reconstruct a 3.0-Å resolution map ( Figures 1 A and S2 ; Table S1 ). The map quality allowed us to confidently model the receptor and the variable domains of the Fab (V H and V L for heavy and light chain variable domains, respectively). Local resolution in the areas of greatest interest, including side-chain interactions between Fab 115 and receptor, was ∼2.9 Å ( Figures S2 I and S3 ; Video S1 ).

The complex structure reveals one Fab 115 bound at each of the two β-α subunit interfaces in the ECD ( Figures 1 A, 2 , S3 , and S4 ). The complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 of the Fab heavy chain penetrates the neurotransmitter-binding pocket and contacts conserved residues known to impact agonist binding ( Figures 2 B, S3 , S4 , and S5 ). In particular, R105 of the V H CDR3 is positioned to make electrostatic and cation-π interactions with several residues on the β2 and α1 subunits ( Figure 2 C). Of special interest is the contact between V H R105 and β2 E155. E155 forms a salt bridge with the primary amine of the neurotransmitter GABA and is critical for binding and gating ( Jatczak-Sliwa et al., 2020 15.

Neurosci. 2004; 24 :11226-11235 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other residues lining the neurotransmitter binding site that interact with CDR3 of Fab 115 have also been implicated in binding to GABA, including the following on the β subunit: Y97 ( Boileau et al., 2002 4. Boileau, A.J. ∙ Newell, J.G. ∙ Czajkowski, C. GABA(A) receptor beta 2 Tyr97 and Leu99 line the GABA-binding site. Insights into mechanisms of agonist and antagonist actions J. Biol.

Zhu, S. ∙ Noviello, C.M. ∙ Teng, J. ... Structure of a human synaptic GABAA receptor Nature. 2018; 559 :67-72 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the Fab 115 V H CDR3 mimics an aspect of neurotransmitter chemistry and likely competes with GABA binding in a manner analogous to a competitive antagonist ( Kim et al., 2020 17. Kim, J.J. ∙ Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ... Shared structural mechanisms of general anaesthetics and benzodiazepines Nature. 2020; 585 :303-308 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ; Masiulis et al., 2019 26. Masiulis, S. ∙ Desai, R. ∙ Uchański, T. ... GABAA receptor signalling mechanisms revealed by structural pharmacology Nature. 2019; 565 :454-459 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In the initial antibody characterization, mAb 115 was found to be selective for binding among different GABA A -receptor subunits ( Kreye et al., 2021 21. Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure reveals the basis of this exquisite selectivity. First, although GABA A β subunits can form a homopentamer, β alone did not bind antibody despite its numerous contacts with Fab 115 in the neurotransmitter-binding pocket ( Kreye et al., 2021 21. Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Examination of the Fab 115 -receptor structure reveals that most of the interactions between Fab 115 and receptors are with the α1 subunit ( Figures 2 E and S5 ); contacts with β alone cannot support binding. Furthermore, mAb 115 is only able to bind GABA A receptors containing the α1, but not α2–5, subunits. This specificity may arise from interactions between Fab 115 and four key residues on the α1 subunit: E170, R173, E174, and R177 ( Figure 2 D). While only R177 has been studied for functional importance ( Newell and Czajkowski, 2003 31. Newell, J.G. ∙ Czajkowski, C. The GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit Pro174-Asp191 segment is involved in GABA binding and channel gating J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :13166-13172 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), evidence for the contribution of all these residues to antibody binding specificity is found in an examination of contacts between Fab 115 and the receptor ( Figure S5 , yellow highlights). Most contacted residues are conserved among α1–α6; as mAb 115 can only bind α1, residues shared across subunits would not be expected to be sufficient for antibody binding. The exceptions are T122–D124 and E170–V180. In the case of T122-D124, Fab 115 only makes electrostatic interactions with backbone carbonyl oxygens; therefore, the identity of the residues present in the receptor is less important. The string of 11 residues beginning at E170 exhibits variable conservation ( Figure 2 D); however, the tetrad of E170, R173, E174, and R177 is only found in α1, and all four residues are involved in salt bridges. These electrostatic contacts are poised to stabilize the Fab-receptor interaction and likely determine the selectivity of Fab 115 for α1-containing receptors.
Structural and sequence analyses suggest the ways in which mAb 115 evolved to increase not just its selectivity but also its affinity for the GABA A receptor. Somatic hypermutation is a process unique to B cells and antibody-secreting cells that diversifies immunoglobulins in their variable gene regions as an adaptive immune response to enhance affinity for their antigenic target. We compared the Fab 115 antibody sequence to an immunoglobulin gene database to derive a germline ancestor with highest sequence identity. This approach identifies somatically hypermutated residues within the variable V(D)J gene segments that have evolved for affinity maturation ( Figure S6 ) ( Reincke et al., 2020 39. Reincke, S.M. ∙ Prüss, H. ∙ Kreye, J. Brain antibody sequence evaluation (BASE): an easy-to-use software for complete data analysis in single cell immunoglobulin cloning BMC Bioinf. 2020; 21 :446 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both Fab 115 V H and V L contain somatically hypermutated residues that are involved in binding the GABA A receptor ( Figure S6 ). These include R97 and K98 of the Fab 115 V L , which are encoded in the germline sequence as an asparagine and a glycine. These mutations contribute two new positive charges at each interface that are stabilized at the interface through salt bridges to help anchor Fab 115 to the α1 subunit ( Figure 2 D). Furthermore, D52 of the Fab 115 V H is an asparagine in the germline antibody sequence ( Figures 2 D and S6 ). This mutation from a polar residue to a charged residue would generate a stronger molecular interaction, changing it from a hydrogen bond to a salt bridge. Thus, somatic hypermutations are predicted to enhance the affinity of Fab 115 for its target.
The mAb 175 autoantibody also triggered seizure activity in rodents and was shown to require both the α1 subunit and the γ2 subunit for binding to the GABA A receptor in cell-based assays ( Kreye et al., 2021 21. Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). The α-γ interface is of special interest because it forms the binding site for benzodiazepines, a modulatory class of GABA A drugs that includes anxiolytics and sedative-hypnotics ( Sigel and Ernst, 2018 40. Sigel, E. ∙ Ernst, M. The benzodiazepine binding sites of GABAA receptors Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2018; 39 :659-671 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ), and is an important site for endogenous modulators, termed endozepines ( Tonon et al., 2020 42. Tonon, M.C. ∙ Vaudry, H. ∙ Chuquet, J. ... Endozepines and their receptors: structure, functions and pathophysiological significance Pharmacol. Ther. 2020; 208 :107386 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). In accordance with requirement of the α-γ interface for mAb 175 binding, FSEC experiments indicated a stoichiometry of 1:1 for receptor:Fab 175 ( Figure S1 D). We used cryo-EM to obtain a structure of the Fab 175 - GABA A complex at an overall resolution of 3.0 Å ( Figures 1 B and S2 H; Table S1 ). The map quality allowed us to confidently model the receptor and the variable domains of the Fab ( Figures S3 G–S3J; Video S2 ).

Overview and zooms of Fab175:GABAA map density, modeling, and quality, refers to Figures 1, 2, S1, S2, and S3
Fab 175 binds at the α1-γ2 subunit interface, consistent with cell-based and FSEC experiments ( Figures 1 B, 3 A, S3 G–S3J, S4 C, and S4D). In a manner similar to Fab 115 , the majority of surface area contacted by Fab 175 is with the α1 subunit ( Figures 3 D and S5 ). Fab 175 V H contains a methionine (M103) that buries itself into a hydrophobic pocket composed of residues from both sides of the α1-γ2 interface, above the benzodiazepine site ( Figures 3 B, S3 H, and S3J). The Fab 175 V L docks onto Loop C of the α1 subunit; this loop caps the benzodiazepine-binding pocket of the receptor ( Figures 3 C and S3 G). This V L attachment site centers upon α1 R164 of the GABA A receptor, which forms a network of five electrostatic interactions connecting the two proteins ( Figure 3 C). This arginine is unique to α1; while some of the other α subunits contain a lysine at this position, a primary amine would not recapitulate the elaborate network of electrostatic interactions. This arginine likely contributes to subunit specificity, as most other receptor residues contacted by Fab 175 are conserved ( Figure S5 ). Fab 175 underwent somatic hypermutation to a lesser degree than Fab 115 , changing six amino acids in the heavy chain and one in the light chain ( Figure S6 ).
The conformational states observed in the receptor structures shed light on how autoantibody binding triggers disease pathology. We first compared the two autoantibody complexes to the structure of the receptor bound to GABA alone ( Figure 4 A) (PDB 6X3Z ) ( Kim et al., 2020 17. Kim, J.J. ∙ Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ... Shared structural mechanisms of general anaesthetics and benzodiazepines Nature. 2020; 585 :303-308 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fab 115 , through direct interactions, stabilizes the neurotransmitter site Loop C in a widely open conformation at β-α interfaces akin to its conformation in the presence of competitive antagonists ( Figure 4 B). Unlike the Fab 115 -bound receptor, the Fab 175 -bound receptor contains density consistent with GABA in its binding site even though the agonist was not added to the preparation. The presence of GABA induces a partial closure of Loop C in the neurotransmitter-binding pockets ( Figure 4 B). Normally, closure of Loop C by agonist triggers a rotation and contraction of the ECD, which is then translated into opening of the transmembrane pore ( Kim and Hibbs, 2021 18. Kim, J.J. ∙ Hibbs, R.E. Direct structural insights into GABAA receptor pharmacology Trends Biochem. Sci. 2021; 46 :502-517 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nemecz et al., 2016 30. Nemecz, A. ∙ Prevost, M.S. ∙ Menny, A. ... Emerging molecular mechanisms of signal Transduction in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels Neuron. 2016; 90 :452-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). After channel opening, the agonist remains bound, but a lower gate in the pore closes, a process termed “desensitization.” Indeed, in a similar preparation, the presence of endogenous GABA caused the TMD to adopt a desensitized-like conformation ( Laverty et al., 2019 22. Laverty, D. ∙ Desai, R. ∙ Uchański, T. ... Cryo-EM structure of the human α1β3γ2 GABAA receptor in a lipid bilayer Nature. 2019; 565 :516-520 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the Fab 175 -bound GABA A structure reveals an interruption in this state transition ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Although Loop C is mostly closed, the ECD of the Fab 175 complex is not contracted. Fab 175 blocks this contraction by wedging between the α1 and γ2 subunits in the upper part of the ECD ( Figure 3 B). Superposition of the Fab 175 -bound structure on the GABA-bound structure suggests that many atomic clashes would prevent the ECD contraction that initiates channel gating in the pentameric receptor superfamily ( Figure 4 G) ( Lefebvre et al., 2021 23. Lefebvre, S.N. ∙ Taly, A. ∙ Menny, A. ... Mutational analysis to explore long-range allosteric couplings involved in a pentameric channel receptor pre-activation and activation Elife. 2021; 10 :e60682 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The consequence is that GABA is positioned farther from the residues of the neurotransmitter-binding pocket. Specifically, the GABA amino nitrogen is 4.1–4.5 Å from E155, as opposed to 2.7–3.1 Å in the GABA-bound structure in the absence of Fab (range covers the two GABA sites). The GABA-E155 interaction is required for converting agonist binding into channel gating ( Newell et al., 2004 32. Newell, J.G. ∙ McDevitt, R.A. ∙ Czajkowski, C. Mutation of glutamate 155 of the GABAA receptor beta2 subunit produces a spontaneously open channel: a trigger for channel activation J. Neurosci. 2004; 24 :11226-11235 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is weakened in the presence of Fab 175 . Together, the consequences of both Fab 115 and Fab 175 binding are stabilization of the receptor pore in a resting-like, non-conducting conformation, with the classical activation gate at the 9ʹ position closed ( Figures 4 D, 4F, and 4H). The structural findings thus suggest a direct competition mechanism for Fab 115 and an allosteric antagonism mechanism for Fab 175 , with both stabilizing a resting-like state of the ion channel.
We sought to probe the structure-based autoantibody mechanisms using functional measurements. Initial electrophysiological studies on autaptic neurons found that mAb 115 but not mAb 175 directly inhibited GABA-activated currents ( Kreye et al., 2021 21. Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed whole-cell patch-clamp experiments on transfected cells expressing the α1β2γ2 receptor to test the concentration dependence of Fab inhibition. These experiments revealed, firstly, that Fab 115 binds effectively irreversibly ( Figure 5 A). Application of GABA after exposing cells to increasing concentrations of Fab revealed a clear dose dependence in inhibition ( Figure 5 B). Tests with Fab 175 revealed no substantial inhibition of GABA activation, consistent with the earlier results obtained by testing inhibition by mAb 175 on autaptic neurons. Nonetheless, when the antibody was injected into the mouse central nervous system (CNS), it triggered spontaneous epileptic events ( Kreye et al., 2021 21. Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structural information suggested that Fab 175 , through binding at the α-γ interface near the benzodiazepine site, could affect the activity of modulators acting there. We thus tested the effect of Fab 175 on diazepam potentiation ( Figure 6 ). We found that Fab 175 , in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibits diazepam potentiation of GABA activation ( Figure 6 B). A speculative mechanism for Fab 175 antagonism of receptor activity may thus involve altering the way endogenous modulators (endozepines) act through this site, with effects on GABA activity too subtle to detect in our patch-clamp experiment. One prominent endozepine is the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), which is a benzodiazepine site ligand that was recently found to be an anti-epileptic positive modulator in the thalamic reticular nucleus ( Christian et al., 2013 6. Christian, C.A. ∙ Herbert, A.G. ∙ Holt, R.L. ... Endogenous positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors by diazepam binding inhibitor Neuron. 2013; 78 :1063-1074 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antagonism of this interaction, as well as other positive modulator endozepines ( Tonon et al., 2020 42. Tonon, M.C. ∙ Vaudry, H. ∙ Chuquet, J. ... Endozepines and their receptors: structure, functions and pathophysiological significance Pharmacol. Ther. 2020; 208 :107386 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), may be a component of how this antibody triggers disease pathology; studies with GABA A subunit knockout mice could further substantiate this hypothesis. Taken together, these findings reveal that distinct mechanisms leveraged by the two antibodies cause autoimmune encephalitis with seizures.

Section: Discussion

The extent to which humoral autoimmunity in the CNS triggers disease has only recently begun to be appreciated. To date there have been no structural studies on how disease-causing autoantibodies from patients act on their neurotransmitter-receptor targets. Here we determined structures of the GABA A receptor bound to two patient-derived pathogenic antibody fragments. The structures reveal how the antibodies bind at distinct subunit interfaces to interfere with receptor function. Mapping of the interactions identified residues important for the specificity of the human antibodies for restricted subtypes of GABA A receptors. We defined conformational changes that are stabilized or inhibited in the presence of autoantibodies by comparison to established GABA A receptor structures. These structural analyses combined with electrophysiological measurements provide mechanisms for direct and allosteric antagonism of inhibitory neurotransmission by autoimmune antibodies and can explain the clinical symptoms of patients with GABA A receptor encephalitis at the atomic level.
In this study we determined two structures of receptor-bound recombinant antibodies that were isolated from an individual patient in the acute phase of an autoimmune encephalitis. While we have shown functional effects of both Fabs that correlate with structural predictions, systematic mutagenesis would be important to confirm the relative importance of individual determinants of antibody-receptor binding. Furthermore, we cannot draw broad conclusions about effects from other GABA A receptor autoantibodies from this individual and other patients. In a previous study, these antibodies recapitulated a severe clinical phenotype reminiscent of autoimmune encephalitis with the predominant symptom of seizures in rodent models without causing receptor internalization. It is possible that other GABA A receptor autoantibodies in this patient and in separate autoimmune encephalitis cases work through receptor crosslinking and internalization. Our findings support that crosslinking and internalization are not the only mechanisms of autoimmune antibodies targeting neuronal receptors and draw attention to a spectrum of alternate mechanisms contributing to autoimmune pathology.

The Sf9 insect cells were obtained from the ATCC (Cat# CRL-1711) and cultured in an InnovaR shaking incubator at 27°C at 130 rpm with Sf900 III media (Thermo Fisher Scientific). HEK293S GnTI- suspension cells were obtained from the ATCC (Cat# CRL-3022) and cultured in a Thermo Scientific Reach-In CO 2 Incubator at 37°C with 8% CO2 at 130 rpm. All cell lines used in this study are female in origin.
Fab fragments were produced as previously described ( Kreye et al., 2021 21. Kreye, J. ∙ Wright, S.K. ∙ van Casteren, A. ... Encephalitis patient-derived monoclonal GABAA receptor antibodies cause epileptic seizures J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210012 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). cDNA encoding the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulins was isolated via reverse transcription and specific amplification from single cerebrospinal fluid cells sampled from a pediatric patient in the acute phase of GABA A receptor encephalitis. These sequences were cloned into mammalian expression vectors, from which monoclonal antibodies were recombinantly expressed in HEK293T cells and purified from cell culture supernatant for initial characterization. Fab fragments were generated by replacing the Fc domains CH2 and CH3 of the heavy chain expression vector with a FLAG-Tag and a His-Tag following the amino acids PKSCDKTH of the hinge region. Fab fragments were expressed, purified using affinity chromatography via the His-Tag and controlled for purity using SDS Page by an external provider ( inVivo BioTech, Germany).
Immunohistochemical stainings of murine brain tissue were performed as previously described ( Kreye et al., 2016 20. Kreye, J. ∙ Wenke, N.K. ∙ Chayka, M. ...

In brief, 20 μm sagittal cryosections were fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA), first blocked in PBS supplemented with 2% BSA (Dianova) and 5% Normal Goat Serum (Abcam) at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated with 20 μg/mL of Fab at 4°C overnight, then with an anti-human Fab-specific secondary antibody (Dianova, 1:500) at room temperature for 2 h, and finally with DRAQ5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500) at room temperature for 10 min. Confocal images were recorded at an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI8) with identical conditions for all Fabs.
To express the GABA A receptor, we generated bacmam virus from a tri-cistronic construct encoding the α1, β2 and γ2 subunits of the GABA A receptor ( Kim et al., 2020 17. Kim, J.J. ∙ Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ... Shared structural mechanisms of general anaesthetics and benzodiazepines Nature. 2020; 585 :303-308 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). These subunits contained a deletion in the intracellular domain between transmembrane helices M3 and M4. These amino acids were replaced with an SQPARAA linker; this deletion does not affect functional behaviors in electrophysiology and functional assays ( Kim et al., 2020 17.

Bacmam viruses were made in Sf9 cells ( Vaughn et al., 1977 43. Vaughn, J.L. ∙ Goodwin, R.H. ∙ Tompkins, G.J. ... The establishment of two cell lines from the insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae) In Vitro. 1977; 13 :213-217 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and the tric-cistronic virus was transduced at an MOI of 1 into HEK293S GnTI − suspension cells ( Reeves et al., 2002 38.

The cells were cultured at 30°C for 72 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were washed once in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride (TBS) and recentrifuged. After resuspension in TBS + 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Sigma), cells were lysed by passage through an Avestin Emulsiflex at 5,000–15,000 psi. Lysed cells were first centrifuged at low speed (10,000 g) to remove nuclei and unlysed cells, then centrifuged at 186,000 g for 2 h to pellet membranes. Membranes were stored at −80°C until used. To purify proteins, approximately 5 g of membranes were Dounce homogenized in TBS + 1 mM PMSF. The detergent n -dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM; Anatrace) was added to a final concentration of 40 mM, and solubilization was performed at 4°C while nutating. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 186,000 g for 40 min. The supernatant containing solubilized protein and its native lipids was bound to Strep-Tactin Superflow high-capacity resin (IBA Life Sciences) via gravity flow. The resin was washed with TBS plus 1 mM DDM, supplemented with 1% Porcine Brain Polar Lipids (Avanti) to promote receptor stability. The GABA A receptor protein was eluted in the same wash buffer supplemented with 5 mM desthiobiotin (Sigma).
Purifications of the GABA A receptor were done in the absence of exogenous ligand. For autoantibody FSEC experiments shown in Figure S1 A, purified receptor reconstituted in lipidic nanodiscs was aliquotted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen until required. A GABA A receptor aliquot was thawed on ice, and ∼2 μg of receptor was incubated with ∼0.5–2 μg of each Fab or mAb at room temperature for 10 min. Protein was diluted in TBS (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and centrifuged to pellet aggregated receptor before analysis by FSEC. The Fab stoichiometry screening shown in Figures S1 B–S1E was performed in a similar manner, with increasing molar ratios of Fab to receptor.
For Cryo-EM, the GABA A receptor protein reconstituted in nanodiscs was concentrated to ∼500 μL. The concentrated protein was divided into 50μL aliquots and preincubated with porcine brain polar lipids for 10 min at room temperature. Saposin ( Lyons et al., 2017 25. Lyons, J.A. ∙ Boggild, A. ∙ Nissen, P. ... Saposin-lipoprotein scaffolds for structure determination of membrane transporters Methods Enzymol. 2017; 594 :85-99 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) was then added for 2 min at room temperature. Porcine brain polar lipids and saposin were added to the purified protein at a molar ratio of 1 GABA A protein: 30 saposin protein: 230 lipid. After the addition of the saposin the mixture was diluted to 500 μL for each aliquot with TBS to initiate reconstitution. This mixture nutated at 4°C overnight in the presence of bio-beads (Bio-Rad) to remove detergent at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. The removal of detergent was continued the next morning with a fresh batch of bio-beads at 4°C for 1 h, after which incorporation was assayed by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography ( Kawate and Gouaux, 2006 16. Kawate, T. ∙ Gouaux, E. Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography for precrystallization screening of integral membrane proteins Structure. 2006; 14 :673-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fab was added to the receptor at molar ratios of 1:3 (for Fab 115 ) or 1:2 (for Fab 175 ). The complex was further polished by size exclusion chromatography using TBS as a mobile phase. The best fractions, as assessed by FSEC, were pooled and concentrated to ∼4–6 mg/mL before freezing for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).
For preparation of cryo-EM grids, 200-mesh Cu 1.2/1.3 grids from Quantifoil were glow-discharged in a Pella glow discharge apparatus for 30 mA/80s on top of a metal grid holder (Ted Pella). To induce random particle orientations, protein was supplemented with 0.5 mM fluorinated fos-choline-8 (Anatrace) immediately before freezing. Grids were frozen with a Mark IV Vitrobot (FEI/ThermoFisher). Three μL of protein were applied to grids before blotting for 3.5 s at 100% humidity and 4°C. Frozen grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until used.
The electron microscopy was performed on a 300kV Titan Krios (FEI/Thermo-Fisher) equipped with a K3 direct electron detector and a GIF energy filter (20 e − V) using super-resolution mode (Gatan) and collected via SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 27. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ). The approximate physical pixel size was 1.079 Å/pixel. The total dose was 36–86 e − /Å 2 .
All data were processed within the Relion 3.1 suite of software ( Zivanov et al., 2018 50. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dose-fractionated images were collected using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 27. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data processing is described in Figure S3 . In brief, micrographs were motion corrected and gain normalized using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 48. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) and defocus values were estimated using GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 47. Zhang, K. Gctf: real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were picked using CrYOLO ( Wagner et al., 2019 44. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following 2D and 3D classification, particle orientations were refined and subjected to Bayesian polishing, all performed in Relion ( Zivanov et al., 2018 50. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Focused 3D classification was performed using the refined angles on polished particles. For the Fab 175 dataset, we performed a further 3D classification focused on the γ-TMD, which is more mobile in some purified sample preparations ( Zhu et al., 2018 49. Zhu, S. ∙ Noviello, C.M. ∙ Teng, J. ... Structure of a human synaptic GABAA receptor Nature. 2018; 559 :67-72 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Fab 115 γ-TMD classes had equivalent density, and this extra step was unnecessary. Programs were compiled by SBGrid ( Morin et al., 2013 28. Morin, A. ∙ Eisenbraun, B. ∙ Key, J. ... Collaboration gets the most out of software Elife. 2013; 2 :e01456 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Statistics for each dataset are shown in Table S1 . The bicuculline-bound α1β2γ2 structure (PDB: 6X3S ) was used as a starting model for the GABA A receptor. To generate starting models for the Fabs used in this study, amino acid sequences were submitted to the SwissModel ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 45. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (7765) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PIGS ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 45. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (7765) PubMed Google Scholar ) servers. The top hits for Fab 175 and Fab 115 were modeled on PDB IDs 4HH9 and 5WL2 ( Bryson et al., 2016 5. Bryson, S. ∙ Thomson, C.A. ∙ Risnes, L.F. ... Structures of preferred human IgV genes-based protective antibodies identify how conserved residues contact diverse antigens and assign source of specificity to CDR3 loop variation J. Immunol. 2016; 196 :4723-4730 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. These homology models were manually docked and then fitted into maps using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 36. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ). Real-space refinement was performed via iterations of local and global adjustment in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 11. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Phenix ( Liebschner et al., 2019 24. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) respectively. Model quality was assessed in MolProbity ( Williams et al., 2018 46. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: more and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2301) PubMed Google Scholar ). For placement of important side chains such as E174 and K98 (of the receptor α1 and Fab 115 Light Chains, respectively), cryo-EM maps were high-pass filtered to 6.0 Å using Relion Image Handler ( Gharpure et al., 2019 12. Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Zhuang, Y. ... Agonist selectivity and ion permeation in the α3β4 ganglionic nicotinic receptor Neuron. 2019; 104 :501-511.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). The pore profiles shown in Figure 4 were created using HOLE ( Smart et al., 1996 41. Smart, O.S. ∙ Neduvelil, J.G. ∙ Wang, X. ... HOLE: a program for the analysis of the pore dimensions of ion channel structural models J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 :354-360 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ); hydrophobicity plots were created with CHAP ( Klesse et al., 2019 19. Klesse, G. ∙ Rao, S. ∙ Sansom, M.S.P. ... CHAP: a versatile tool for the structural and functional annotation of ion channel pores J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431 :3353-3365 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Variable antibody sequences were compared using custom BASE software ( Reincke et al., 2020 39. Reincke, S.M. ∙ Prüss, H. ∙ Kreye, J. Brain antibody sequence evaluation (BASE): an easy-to-use software for complete data analysis in single cell immunoglobulin cloning BMC Bioinf. 2020; 21 :446 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) to human immunoglobulin germline V(D)J gene segments to identify genes with highest sequence identity.
Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from adherent HEK293S GnTI − cells transiently transfected with the tri-cistronic pEZT construct used for structural analysis. Each well of cells in a 12-well dish was transfected with 0.1–0.3 μg plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were incubated at 30°C. 24 h post-transfection, cells were re-plated on 35 mm dishes and allowed to settle for at least 2 h. Recordings were made 24–96 h after transfection. Bath solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 4 MgCl 2 , 4 CaCl 2 , 5 HEPES and 10 glucose pH 7.3. Borosilicate pipettes were pulled and polished to an initial resistance of 2–4 MΩ and filled with the pipette solution containing (in mM): 100 CsCl, 30 CsF, 10 NaCl, 10 EGTA, and 20 HEPES pH 7.3. The recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, sampled at 5 kHz, and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz using a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices) and analyzed with pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Cells were held at −75 mV. Solution exchange was achieved using a gravity driven RSC-200 rapid solution changer (Bio-Logic). For short application (60–80 s pre-application), Fab solutions were prepared in bath solution from a concentrated stock solution.
Peak currents in whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology experiments were measured in the absence or presence of antibody fragments. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 software (GraphPad software, Inc, La Jolla, CA). Data are expressed as means ± S.D, and Welch’s t-test was used. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant ( ∗∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.0001; ∗∗∗ , p ≤ 0.001; ∗ , 0.01 ≤ p ≤ 0.05, unless defined specifically in the figure legend) ( Figures 5 and 6 ). Replicate numbers n = 7-9 for Figure 5 and n = 4–12 for Figure 6 , from independent cells.
