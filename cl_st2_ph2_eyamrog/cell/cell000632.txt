Title: A volatile from the skin microbiota of flavivirus-infected hosts promotes mosquito attractiveness


Abstract: Summary

The host-seeking activity of hematophagous arthropods is essential for arboviral transmission. Here, we demonstrate that mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses can manipulate host skin microbiota to produce a scent that attracts mosquitoes. We observed that Aedes mosquitoes preferred to seek and feed on mice infected by dengue and Zika viruses. Acetophenone, a volatile compound that is predominantly produced by the skin microbiota, was enriched in the volatiles from the infected hosts to potently stimulate mosquito olfaction for attractiveness. Of note, acetophenone emission was higher in dengue patients than in healthy people. Mechanistically, flaviviruses infection suppressed the expression of RELMα, an essential antimicrobial protein on host skin, thereby leading to the expansion of acetophenone-producing commensal bacteria and, consequently, a high acetophenone level. Given that RELMα can be specifically induced by a vitamin A derivative, the dietary administration of isotretinoin to flavivirus-infected animals interrupted flavivirus life cycle by reducing mosquito host-seeking activity, thus providing a strategy of arboviral control.

Section: Introduction

Arboviruses naturally survive between vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors. The hematophagous behavior-mediated viral life cycle is a complex and dynamic biological process involving a multidimensional interplay among viruses, vectors, and hosts ( Yu et al., 2019 43. Yu, X. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ Xiao, X. ... Progress towards understanding the mosquito-borne virus life cycle Trends Parasitol. 2019; 35 :1009-1017 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Basically, hematophagous arthropods need to actively locate a host and incidentally feed on a viremic host to acquire infectious viral particles circulating in the host blood. The viruses subsequently establish an infection in the vectors, thereby enabling them to become competent to transmit viruses to naive hosts through blood feeding ( Franz et al., 2015 14. Franz, A.W. ∙ Kantor, A.M. ∙ Passarelli, A.L. ... Tissue barriers to arbovirus infection in mosquitoes Viruses. 2015; 7 :3741-3767 Crossref Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2017 45. Zhu, Y. ∙ Zhang, R. ∙ Zhang, B. ... Blood meal acquisition enhances arbovirus replication in mosquitoes through activation of the GABAergic system Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1262 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, an essential vector behavior for viral acquisition is that hematophagous arthropods orient to viremic hosts with a high frequency. Therefore, pathogen-infected host individuals may be more attractive to relevant vectors due to altered host cues following infection ( De Moraes et al., 2014 9. De Moraes, C.M. ∙ Stanczyk, N.M. ∙ Betz, H.S. ... Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11079-11084 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this is particularly true in the transmission of human parasites ( Robinson et al., 2018 31. Robinson, A. ∙ Busula, A.O. ∙ Voets, M.A. ... Plasmodium-associated changes in human odor attract mosquitoes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E4209-E4218 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is well documented that malaria-induced changes in host odors manipulate mosquito attraction ( Busula et al., 2017 4. Busula, A.O. ∙ Bousema, T. ∙ Mweresa, C.K. ... Gametocytemia and attractiveness of Plasmodium falciparum -infected Kenyan children to Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes J. Infect. Dis. 2017; 216 :291-295 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robinson et al., 2018 31. Robinson, A. ∙ Busula, A.O. ∙ Voets, M.A. ... Plasmodium-associated changes in human odor attract mosquitoes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E4209-E4218 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, it is still largely unknown whether arboviruses might exploit a similar strategy to shape host-vector interactions, thereby enhancing the probability of viral dissemination in nature.
Volatiles are one of the key host cues to manipulate the feeding motivation of hematophagous vectors ( Takken and Knols, 1999 35. Takken, W. ∙ Knols, B.G. Odor-mediated behavior of Afrotropical malaria mosquitoes Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1999; 44 :131-157 Crossref Scopus (538) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accumulating evidence indicates that both infection and inflammatory responses can reshape the spectrum of host odorants, thereby enabling the influence of vector behavior ( Emami et al., 2017 12. Emami, S.N. ∙ Lindberg, B.G. ∙ Hua, S. ... A key malaria metabolite modulates vector blood seeking, feeding, and susceptibility to infection Science. 2017; 355 :1076-1080 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robinson et al., 2018 31. Robinson, A. ∙ Busula, A.O. ∙ Voets, M.A. ... Plasmodium-associated changes in human odor attract mosquitoes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E4209-E4218 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 40. Wang, R.L. ∙ Zhu-Salzman, K. ∙ Elzaki, M.E.A. ... Mikania micrantha wilt virus alters insect vector's host preference to enhance its own spread Viruses. 2019; 11 :336 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ). For example, an isoprenoid precursor produced by P lasmodium affects mosquitoes’ blood meal-seeking and feeding behaviors by increasing the release of volatile blends by human red blood cells ( Emami et al., 2017 12. Emami, S.N. ∙ Lindberg, B.G. ∙ Hua, S. ... A key malaria metabolite modulates vector blood seeking, feeding, and susceptibility to infection Science. 2017; 355 :1076-1080 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Malaria-infected mice were significantly more attractive to mosquito vectors, accompanied by increased emission of skin volatiles ( De Moraes et al., 2014 9. De Moraes, C.M. ∙ Stanczyk, N.M. ∙ Betz, H.S. ... Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11079-11084 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we demonstrated that acetophenone released from the skin microbiota of flavivirus-infected hosts facilitates mosquito attractiveness, thus enhancing flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes. Flaviviruses can promote the proliferation of acetophenone-producing skin commensal bacteria by suppressing the expression of the essential antimicrobial protein RELMα. These results demonstrate that flaviviruses can manipulate host skin microbiota to produce a mosquito attractant and facilitate transmission and provide an alternative strategy of arboviral control.

Section: Results

For the transmission of vector-borne pathogens, host cues may play an essential role in determining the seeking and feeding motivation of hematophagous arthropods ( De Moraes et al., 2014 9. De Moraes, C.M. ∙ Stanczyk, N.M. ∙ Betz, H.S. ... Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11079-11084 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore determined whether Aedes aegypti mosquitoes may present different behavioral responses to host cues from mice infected by flaviviruses. A three-cage olfactometer assay was exploited to test mosquito responses to these airstreams in which the air passes through two-side independent chambers containing either Zika virus (ZIKV)-infected or uninfected mice at a constant rate ( Figure 1 A). Sixty female A. aegypti mosquitoes (Rockefeller strain) were released into the central cage, where they freely chose to enter the trapping chamber on either side. Three type I and II interferon-receptor-deficient ( ifnagr −/− ) C57BL/6 (AG6) mice, which have been exploited as an animal model of ZIKV infection ( Zhu et al., 2019 44. Zhu, Y. ∙ Tong, L. ∙ Nie, K. ... Host serum iron modulates dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2405-2415 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), were placed into each chamber to assess downwind mosquito responses. The remaining individuals in each trapping chamber were counted to present the choice preference of mosquitoes ( Figure 1 A). Given that the ZIKV-infected AG6 mice presented high viremia from 2–6 days and died at 8–10 days post-infection ( Figure S1 A), the behavioral test was performed over the course of infection until 6 days. At days 0 and 2 after infection, the ratios of mosquitoes entering both trapping chambers were similar (∼50%). By days 4 and 6 after infection, the number of mosquitoes in the trapping chamber next to the ZIKV-infected mice was greater than that in the trapping chamber close to uninfected mice (∼70% versus 30%) ( Figure 1 B). These results suggest that mosquitoes preferred ZIKV-infected over uninfected mice. We noted a similar preference of mosquitoes seeking dengue virus 2 (DENV2)-infected over uninfected animals ( Figures 1 C and S1 B). We next exploited a two-port olfactometer assay to further assess flavivirus infection-mediated attraction to Aedes mosquitoes. This olfactometer entails passing filtered air at a constant rate through two glass chambers containing odor sources (infected or uninfected AG6 mice) and testing downwind mosquito responses to these airstreams ( Figure 1 D). Sixty female A. aegypti mosquitoes were used for each trial, where we found a positive mosquito response to either infected or uninfected mice flying to the upwind end of the tunnel, and they entered a trapping chamber randomly assigned to that source and probed the mesh screen that prevented further upwind movement ( Figure 1 D). Consistent with the results from a three-cage olfactometer assay, more mosquitoes entered the chamber of ZIKV- ( Figure 1 E) and DENV2- ( Figure 1 F) infected animals at 4 and 6 days post-infection than those flowing to the chamber of uninfected animals.
Several host cues are known to influence mosquito behaviors, such as heat ( Corfas and Vosshall, 2015 8. Corfas, R.A. ∙ Vosshall, L.B. The cation channel TRPA1 tunes mosquito thermotaxis to host temperatures eLife. 2015; 4 :e11750 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) ( Gillies, 1980 17. Gillies, M.T. The role of carbon dioxide in host-finding by mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae): a review Bull. Entomol. Res. 1980; 70 :525-532 Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar ), and odor emission ( Cardé, 2015 6. Cardé, R.T. Multi-cue integration: how female mosquitoes locate a human host Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :R793-R795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). A previous study suggested that CO 2 is a potent activator of mosquito host-seeking ( Gillies, 1980 17. Gillies, M.T. The role of carbon dioxide in host-finding by mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae): a review Bull. Entomol. Res. 1980; 70 :525-532 Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, the CO 2 emission was significantly reduced from 5 days after ZIKV infection, which may be attributed to the deteriorating physiological status before animal death ( Figure S1 C). CO 2 emissions by DENV2-infected mice were not altered compared with uninfected mice ( Figure S1 D). These results suggest that CO 2 emission is not the host cue accounting for the increased attractiveness of the infected animals to A. aegypti in this olfactometer system. In addition to CO 2 emission, body temperature increased after infection by both ZIKV ( Figure S1 E) and DENV2 ( Figure S1 F). We next assessed the role of body temperature in animal attractiveness to mosquitoes. Intraperitoneal inoculation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the mouse body temperature from 5 to 8 h post-treatment ( Figure S1 G). In the same experimental settings in Figure 1 A, the number of mosquitoes drawn to the mice with a high body temperature at 6 h post-LPS inoculation was the same as that to the control mice ( Figure S1 H), thereby excluding body temperature as an essential host cue for the mosquitoes’ host-seeking behavior in these experimental settings. We next assessed the role of odor emission from animals in mosquito host-seeking behavior by employing a deodorization device that absorbs volatiles in the airflow passing through two-sided independent chambers containing either infected or uninfected mice ( Figure 1 G). In this setting, the ratios of mosquitoes seeking infected and uninfected animals were comparable ( Figures 1 H and 1I), indicating that an odorant(s) from the infected animals determined the mosquitoes’ behavioral preference.
The aforementioned studies were performed with the long-term lab-adapted A. aegypti Rockefeller strain. We next exploited two field A. aegypti strains from Paraiba in Brazil (Brazil Paraiba strain) and Yunnan Province in China (China Yunan Strain) in our investigation. With the three-cage olfactometer assay described in Figure 1 A, both strains preferred ZIKV- and DENV2-infected mice at 4 and 6 days after infection to uninfected mice ( Figures S1 I and S1J). In addition to A. aegypti , Aedes albopictus is another native mosquito vector for DENV and ZIKV transmission. Consistently, a field A. albopictus strain collected from Jiangsu province in China (China Jiangsu strain) presented a similar preferential behavior to the flavivirus-infected mice ( Figure S1 K). Taken together, we conclude that Aedes mosquitoes’ host-seeking behavior can be motivated by volatile cues from flavivirus-infected animals.
We next characterized the volatile emissions of DENV2- and ZIKV-infected mice over a time course. Whole-body volatiles from infected and healthy mice were collected in glass chambers connected to a volatile collection system that pushed clean air over the mice to go through adsorbent filters for 8 h ( Figure S2 A). Three parallel samples from a time point were then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay (GC-MS) at 4 and 6 days post-infection. Four hundred twenty-two compounds were identified ( Figure 2 A; Table S1 ). The volatile compounds that were >1.5-fold regulated in infected mice than in uninfected mice at both 4 and 6 days after infection were analyzed in depth. Indeed, 11 volatiles were upregulated, and 19 were downregulated in the DENV2-infected animals compared with in healthy controls. Thirteen and 9 compounds were up- and downregulated by ZIKV infection, respectively. Twenty compounds (11 upregulated and 9 downregulated) were common to both DENV2- and ZIKV-infected mice ( Figure S2 B). We therefore assessed whether these common volatile compounds may stimulate the mosquitoes’ olfactory response by an electroantennogram assay. Three compounds, acetophenone, decanal, and styrene, elicited a significant electrophysiological response (>100 μV) of the A. aegypti antenna ( Figure 2 B) in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 C), in which the highest response was activated by acetophenone. Subsequently, we assessed the effects of 20 regulated volatile compounds on the host-seeking activity of the A. aegypti mosquitoes using the three-cage olfactometer assay in Figure 1 A. Only acetophenone, but not other compounds, attracted more mosquitoes than the mock treatment (∼70% versus 30%) ( Figure S2 C). Subsequently, we used a two-port olfactometer assay described in Figure 1 D to validate this effect of acetophenone. Consistent with the above-mentioned results, 1 μg or more acetophenone to the animal skin had a significant effect on mosquitoes’ host-seeking behavior; however, 0.1 μg of acetophenone did not ( Figure 2 D). Notably, acetophenone, when applied to human hands, also demonstrated a more potent mosquito-attracting effect ( Figure 2 E). Taken together, these results indicate that acetophenone is a host odorant upregulated by flavivirus infection and a potent attractant for mosquitoes.
We next investigated the biological relevance of acetophenone emitted by animals to mosquito attraction. First, we quantified the exact amount of acetophenone released from infected or uninfected mice by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) assay ( Figure 2 F). The odorant blends samples were collected from AG6 mice at 4 days after DENV2 or ZIKV infection in a glass chamber through SPME fibers for 30 min. The uninfected mice were served as mock controls. Based on the standard curve ( Figure S2 D), the absolute abundance of acetophenone released by either DENV2 or ZIKV was measured by SPME. The amounts of acetophenone produced by virus-infected mice were ∼10-fold higher than those produced by uninfected animals ( Figure 2 F) (DENV: 92 versus 9 ng per 30 min; ZIKV: 104 versus 9 ng per 30 min). We next assessed the amount of acetophenone volatilized from the mice spread with 0.1, 1, and 10 μg of acetophenone on their skin. Of note, 89–150 and 733–1,160 ng of airborne acetophenone were recovered from the mice treated with 1 and 10 μg of acetophenone on the skin, respectively ( Figures S2 E and 2F). These data demonstrate that mice spread with 1 μg of acetophenone on their skin and flavivirus-infected animals produced comparable airborne concentrations of acetophenone.
To further assess the role of human odorants in mosquito attractiveness, we recruited dengue fever patients and healthy volunteers ( Table S2 ) and collected odorant blends from their armpits by stir bars coating with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) ( Soini et al., 2006 33. Soini, H.A. ∙ Bruce, K.E. ∙ Klouckova, I. ... In situ surface sampling of biological objects and preconcentration of their volatiles for chromatographic analysis Anal. Chem. 2006; 78 :7161-7168 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), and next eluted the volatile extracts by the n -hexane solvent from the PDMS stir bars. The volatile extracts were applied on filter paper, which was subsequently attached onto the palm of a volunteer hand for a mosquito behavioral assay with a two-port olfactometer ( Figure 2 G). A negative control was the other hand from the same volunteer attached to filter paper with a solvent blank. Both hands were placed into the two glass chambers for 30 min to assess the downwind mosquito response to the airstream ( Figure 2 G). The hands with volatile extracts from dengue patients presented higher attraction to mosquitoes than those with volatile extracts from healthy donors ( Figures 2 H–2J), indicating that DENV infection leads to enhanced emission of skin volatile cues for mosquitoes. However, some polar compounds are mosquito attractants ( Raji et al., 2019 29. Raji, J.I. ∙ Melo, N. ∙ Castillo, J.S. ... Aedes aegypti mosquitoes detect acidic volatiles found in human odor using the IR8a Pathway Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :1253-1262 e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) that cannot be eluted by nonpolar n -hexane ( Abbaszadeh et al., 2014 1. Abbaszadeh, G. ∙ Srivastava, C. ∙ Walia, S. Insecticidal and antifeedant activities of clerodane diterpenoids isolated from the Indian bhant tree, Clerodendron infortunatum , against the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera J. Insect Sci. 2014; 14 :29 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Galassi et al., 2020 15. Galassi, F.G. ∙ Picollo, M.I. ∙ Gonzalez-Audino, P. Head louse feces: chemical analysis and behavioral activity J. Med. Entomol. 2020; 57 :336-342 PubMed Google Scholar ). To distinguish the impact of nonpolar attractants on mosquito behavior from that of polar extracts, we designed a two-step extraction protocol. We first used n -hexane to extract nonpolar volatiles including acetophenone from the PDMS stir bars (designated the primary extract), and then methanol to elute polar compounds only (designated the secondary extract) ( Bedner and Saito, 2020 2. Bedner, M. ∙ Saito, K. Development of a liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry method for determining off-flavor compounds and its application toward marine recirculating aquaculture system monitoring and evaluation of aeration as a depuration approach J. Chromatogr. A. 2020; 1609 :460499 PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 A). Indeed, the secondary methanol extract containing only polar compounds were also able to attract more mosquitoes than the methanol solvent alone did ( Figures S3 B and S3C). However, the secondary extract from dengue patients showed similar attractiveness to mosquitoes compared with those from healthy donors ( Figure S3 D), suggesting that the polar mosquito attractants are not significantly upregulated, and n -hexane extracts contain the upregulated cues in dengue patients. Therefore, we next analyzed human skin volatiles from both healthy and dengue patients by a thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (TD-GC-MS) system. Consistent with the above-mentioned animal studies, the dengue patients showed much higher emission of acetophenone than the healthy donors ( Figure 2 K). Apart from acetophenone, 6 volatile compounds (2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, decanal, ethylbenzene, methyl palmitate, styrene, and toluene) were also found in the human skin odorants. However, there were no significant differences in the abundances of these 6 volatiles between dengue patients and healthy donors ( Figure S3 E). Thus, we focused only on acetophenone in this study.
We next aimed to identify the source of acetophenone from the infected mice. Acetophenone is a common metabolic byproduct predominantly from bacteria ( Jobst et al., 2010 22. Jobst, B. ∙ Schühle, K. ∙ Linne, U. ... ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetophenone by a novel type of carboxylase J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192 :1387-1394 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Acetophenone can be generated from ethyl benzene by an ethyl benzene dehydrogenase, and then converted by (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase ( Jobst et al., 2010 22. Jobst, B. ∙ Schühle, K. ∙ Linne, U. ... ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetophenone by a novel type of carboxylase J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192 :1387-1394 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, homologs of the essential enzymes for acetophenone biogenesis are absent from mammalian genomes. Although acetophenone might still be synthesized by an unidentified pathway(s) in mammals, we speculated that acetophenone may be predominantly produced by commensal microbes residing in the intestine or on animal skin ( Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012 21. Human Microbiome Project Consortium Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome Nature. 2012; 486 :207-214 Crossref Scopus (8287) PubMed Google Scholar ). We exploited a three-cage olfactometer assay ( Figure 3 A) to test the mosquito responses to the infected AG6 mice with or without the commensal microbiota. The visceral microbiota (mainly gastrointestinal microbiota) was depleted by oral application of an antibiotic cocktail for 1 week ( Figure S4 A) ( Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004 30. Rakoff-Nahoum, S. ∙ Paglino, J. ∙ Eslami-Varzaneh, F. ... Recognition of commensal microflora by toll-like receptors is required for intestinal homeostasis Cell. 2004; 118 :229-241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3510) PubMed Google Scholar ). The skin microbiota was removed by sonication brushing and 70% alcohol spraying ( Figure S4 B) ( Wang et al., 2018 41. Wang, Y. ∙ Tan, X. ∙ Xi, C. ... Removal of Staphylococcus aureus from skin using a combination antibiofilm approach NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes. 2018; 4 :16 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, depletion of gut microbiota alone did not influence the mosquito behavioral preference for the infected mice, while depletion of skin microbiota made the infected mice much less attractive to mosquitoes, similar to uninfected controls ( Figures 3 B and 3C). The results indicate that the commensal microbiota associated with mouse skin, rather than the gut, is the major source of attractant for mosquitoes. Removal of gut microbiota did not affect acetophenone emission by animals; nonetheless, deficiency of skin microbiota largely eliminated the volatilization of acetophenone from either infected or uninfected mice ( Figure 3 D), indicating that the skin commensal microbiota is the essential source of acetophenone.
We next profiled the skin microbiota of both infected and uninfected AG6 mice. Of note, the abundance of total cultivable skin bacteria was enhanced by ∼10-fold after DENV2 and ZIKV infection ( Figure 3 E). The abundance of bacteria in 16 genera, such as Bacillus , Brevundimonas , and Staphylococcus , was upregulated by >1.5-fold, while that of 16 bacterial genera, such as Lactobacillus and Pantoea , was reduced by >1.5-fold on the skin of flavivirus-infected mice ( Figures 3 F and 3G; Table S3 ). These sequencing results were further validated by qPCR ( Figure 3 H). Subsequently, we isolated 36 cultivable bacteria from murine skin. The capacity of acetophenone generation by these bacteria was determined by a GC-MS assay. Of note, 4 Bacillus spp. were the most potent producers of acetophenone ( Figure 3 I). However, Lactobacillus spp. that were most downregulated by DENV2 and ZIKV infection lacked the capacity of acetophenone generation ( Figure 3 I). Altogether, skin commensal bacteria, such as some Bacillus spp., can rapidly expand following DENV and ZIKV infection, thereby enhancing acetophenone emission from infected mice. We next used a three-cage olfactometer assay to assess the role of acetophenone-releasing skin bacteria in mosquito attraction. The mice treated with Bacillus flexus , Bacillus megaterum , Bacillus proteolyticus , and Bacillus wiedmannii were more attractive to mosquitoes than those treated with Lactobacillus animalis , Lactobacillus fermentum , Lactobacillus johnsonii , and Lactobacillus mucosae ( Figure 3 J). Taken together, these data suggest that the population of acetophenone-producing bacteria increases on the skin of flavivirus-infected hosts, thereby promoting mosquito-feeding behavior.
Maintenance of skin microbiota homeostasis requires delicate host immune responses in the epidermis, among which antimicrobial proteins are of great importance ( Belkaid and Segre, 2014 3. Belkaid, Y. ∙ Segre, J.A. Dialogue between skin microbiota and immunity Science. 2014; 346 :954-959 Crossref Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gallo and Hooper, 2012 16. Gallo, R.L. ∙ Hooper, L.V. Epithelial antimicrobial defence of the skin and intestine Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :503-516 Crossref Scopus (697) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare transcript abundances in the skin of DENV2- or ZIKV-infected AG6 mice to those in the skin of uninfected animals. There were 317 genes significantly up- or downregulated in both DENV2- and ZIKV-infected animals ( Figure 4 A), with Retnla being the most significantly downregulated in the skin of flavivirus-infected animals ( Figure 4 B; Table S4 ). Retnla encodes resistin-like molecule-α (RELMα), an antimicrobial protein specifically expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and sebocytes ( Harris et al., 2019 19. Harris, T.A. ∙ Gattu, S. ∙ Propheter, D.C. ... Resistin-like molecule alpha provides vitamin-A-dependent antimicrobial protection in the skin Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :777-788 e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). RELMα acts as an essential factor to shape the composition of resident bacterial communities and protects against pathogenic bacterial infection of skin ( Harris et al., 2019 19. Harris, T.A. ∙ Gattu, S. ∙ Propheter, D.C. ... Resistin-like molecule alpha provides vitamin-A-dependent antimicrobial protection in the skin Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :777-788 e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). The downregulation of Retnla transcripts was confirmed by qPCR ( Figure 4 C). Consistently, the abundance of RELMα protein was also reduced in the skin of infected mice ( Figure 4 D). The human genome encodes two RELM proteins, with RETN predominantly expressed by keratinocytes and sebaceous glands of the skin and RELMβ by the intestine ( Harrison et al., 2007 20. Harrison, W.J. ∙ Bull, J.J. ∙ Seltmann, H. ... Expression of lipogenic factors galectin-12, resistin, SREBP-1, and SCD in human sebaceous glands and cultured sebocytes J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127 :1309-1317 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rajala et al., 2003 28. Rajala, M.W. ∙ Obici, S. ∙ Scherer, P.E. ... Adipose-derived resistin and gut-derived resistin-like molecule-beta selectively impair insulin action on glucose production J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111 :225-230 Crossref Scopus (489) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next tested the bactericidity of murine RELMα and human RETN. Recombinant mRELMα and RETN were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to a previous experimental procedure ( Harris et al., 2019 19. Harris, T.A. ∙ Gattu, S. ∙ Propheter, D.C. ... Resistin-like molecule alpha provides vitamin-A-dependent antimicrobial protection in the skin Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :777-788 e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S4 C and S4D). We added the purified proteins to a panel of commensal skin bacteria. Both mRELMα and RETN reduced the viability of B. flexus , B. megaterum , B. proteolyticus , and B. wiedmannii strains in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 4 E and 4F). The viability of other commensal skin bacteria also declined, but much less markedly ( Figures 4 G and 4H). We next assessed the growth competence of these isolated commensal bacteria on host skin. A total of 10 3 CFUs (colony-forming units) of 8 commensal bacteria was mixed and subsequently applied to the germ-free skin of DENV2-infected AG6 mice, where mRELMα expression was deficient. After 3 days, the acetophenone-producing Bacillus spp. was dominant populations among all cultivable bacteria ( Figure 4 I). Indeed, accumulating evidence has indicated that Bacillus spp. was much more proliferative than other commensal bacterial species on the skin. Overall, flaviviruses can downregulate RELMα, thus favoring the proliferation of acetophenone-producing bacteria over others in the host skin.
RELMα can be induced by dietary vitamin A derivatives to shape the composition of skin-resident bacterial communities and mediate vitamin-A-dependent resistance to skin infection ( Harris et al., 2019 19. Harris, T.A. ∙ Gattu, S. ∙ Propheter, D.C. ... Resistin-like molecule alpha provides vitamin-A-dependent antimicrobial protection in the skin Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :777-788 e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next assessed whether oral administration of vitamin A derivatives might rescue the expression of RELMα in the skin of flavivirus-infected animals, thereby suppressing the growth of acetophenone-producing bacteria to reduce the mosquitoes’ host-seeking motivation. DENV2- or ZIKV-infected AG6 mice were treated by oral gavage daily with 1 mg of isotretinoin, a vitamin A derivative, in 10% DMSO/corn oil. The infected animals treated with 10% DMSO/corn oil were negative controls ( Figure 5 A). The expression of RELMα was significantly suppressed in the infected mice but rescued by administration of isotretinoin ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Consistent with the previous results ( Figure 3 F), the abundance of Bacillus spp. was largely reduced on the skin of isotretinoin-treated animals compared with that of negative controls ( Figure 5 D). We next assessed mosquito preference in flavivirus-infected AG6 mice with or without administration of isotretinoin. These mice were all placed in cages. Subsequently, the female A. aegypti mosquitoes were released into the cage, and their blood-feeding activity was recorded for 15 min ( Figure 5 A). There were far more mosquitoes successfully feeding on flavivirus-infected mice than on uninfected mice ( Figures 5 E–5G). Of note, the mosquitoes feeding on isotretinoin-treated, virus-infected mice were the same as those feeding on uninfected animals ( Figures 5 E–5G). The average body weight of fed mosquitoes was no different among each group, suggesting that dietary administration of isotretinoin to mice reduces mosquitoes’ host-seeking activity, rather than feeding efficiency ( Figures S5 A–S5C). We next reared the fed mosquitoes for an additional 8 days and quantified their viral loads, the proportion of virus-positive to successfully fed mosquitoes was comparable among all groups ( Figures 5 H–5J). However, in accordance with the feeding success rate ( Figures 5 E–5G), dietary administration of isotretinoin significantly reduced the proportion of virus-positive to total mosquitoes ( Figures 5 K–5M). Meanwhile, we found that isotretinoin does not influence viral loads in AG6 mice ( Figures S5 D and S5E). These results indicate that dietary supplementation of a vitamin A derivative to flavivirus-infected hosts reduce viral transmission.

Section: Discussion

Mosquito-borne viruses naturally maintain a life cycle between vertebrate hosts and mosquitoes via blood-feeding activity ( Yu et al., 2019 43. Yu, X. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ Xiao, X. ... Progress towards understanding the mosquito-borne virus life cycle Trends Parasitol. 2019; 35 :1009-1017 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, mosquitoes’ host-seeking, -probing, and -feeding behaviors in response to host cues directly determine the probability that viruses are acquired, retained, and transmitted by mosquitoes ( Yang et al., 2011 42. Yang, G. ∙ Winberg, G. ∙ Ren, H. ... Expression, purification and functional analysis of an odorant binding protein AaegOBP22 from Aedes aegypti Protein Expr. Purif. 2011; 75 :165-171 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Volatiles are essential host cues that trigger the feeding activity of arthropods. In this study, we elucidated that hosts infected by DENV and ZIKV were more attractive to the natural mosquito vectors A. aegypti and A. albopictus . Acetophenone, a bacterial metabolic byproduct and a potent mosquito attractant, was augmented in flavivirus-infected animals compared with uninfected animals. Of note, flavivirus infections suppressed RELMα-mediated bactericidity, thereby enabling the robust growth of acetophenone-producing bacteria on host skin. Given that RELMα can be induced by vitamin A derivatives, we demonstrated that dietary administration of isotretinoin in flavivirus-infected animals reduced flavivirus acquisition from infected hosts to mosquitoes. Overall, these results offer an example that pathogens may manipulate host cues and vector behaviors in ways that enhance their own transmission.
Our studies revealed that acetophenone produced by resident commensal bacteria on the host skin is a potent mosquito attractant. Indeed, commensal microbial communities on the skin are a major source of human body odor ( Verhulst et al., 2010b 39. Verhulst, N.O. ∙ Takken, W. ∙ Dicke, M. ... Chemical ecology of interactions between human skin microbiota and mosquitoes FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2010; 74 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). The composition of the skin microbiota affects the attractiveness of humans to these anthropophilic insects. Volatile organic compounds released by animal skin, many of which are of skin bacterial origin, appear to be essential for inducing insect seeking for hosts. For example, the bacterial volatiles produced by Leptotrichia , Delftia , Actinobacteria Gp3 , and Bacillus spp. show much higher mosquito attractiveness than the volatiles released from other bacterial species ( Verhulst et al., 2011 38. Verhulst, N.O. ∙ Qiu, Y.T. ∙ Beijleveld, H. ... Composition of human skin microbiota affects attractiveness to malaria mosquitoes PLoS One. 2011; 6 :e28991 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). The relative abundances of five bacterial species, Bacillus subtilis , Brevibacterium epidermidis , Corynebacterium minutissimum , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Staphylococcus epidermidis , were significantly related to the attractiveness of the host to Anopheles gambiae ( Verhulst et al., 2010a 37. Verhulst, N.O. ∙ Andriessen, R. ∙ Groenhagen, U. ... Differential attraction of malaria mosquitoes to volatile blends produced by human skin bacteria PLoS One. 2010; 5 :e15829 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). The abundance of Staphylococcus spp. was positively correlated with the attractiveness of humans to Anopheles mosquitoes ( Verhulst et al., 2011 38. Verhulst, N.O. ∙ Qiu, Y.T. ∙ Beijleveld, H. ... Composition of human skin microbiota affects attractiveness to malaria mosquitoes PLoS One. 2011; 6 :e28991 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, despite constant exposure of the skin to the environment, the microbial composition remains highly stable over time ( Chen et al., 2018 7. Chen, Y.E. ∙ Fischbach, M.A. ∙ Belkaid, Y. Skin microbiota-host interactions Nature. 2018; 553 :427-436 Crossref Scopus (448) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting mutually beneficial interactions between skin commensal microbes and the hosts. In this study, we found that skin commensal bacteria belonging to the Bacillus genus are the main producers of acetophenone, a potent attractant for Aedes mosquitoes. The abundance of these commensal bacteria on the host skin was largely enhanced following DENV and ZIKV infection. Altogether, our studies suggest that the skin microbiota plays an important role in the transmission of arboviral pathogens.
The host skin directly contacts the external environment and thus continuously interfaces with large numbers of microorganisms ( Callewaert et al., 2020 5. Callewaert, C. ∙ Ravard Helffer, K. ∙ Lebaron, P. Skin microbiome and its interplay with the environment Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2020; 21 :4-11 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schommer and Gallo, 2013 32. Schommer, N.N. ∙ Gallo, R.L. Structure and function of the human skin microbiome Trends Microbiol. 2013; 21 :660-668 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Skin cells therefore secrete a variety of antimicrobial and immune factors to fight against this immense microbial challenge. In this study, we identified that the expression of RELMα, an essential antimicrobial protein expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and sebocytes, suppressed by flavivirus infection, thereby resulting in the robust growth of specific bacterial species on the host skin. A remaining question is how flaviviruses suppress the expression of RELMα in the skin. One possibility is that RELMα expression is controlled by some pattern recognition receptors that are expressed in skin cells. Indeed, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in epithelial cells controls the expression of several epithelial antimicrobial proteins, such as REGIIIγ and RELMβ, in gut epithelial cells ( Vaishnava et al., 2011 36. Vaishnava, S. ∙ Yamamoto, M. ∙ Severson, K.M. ... The antibacterial lectin RegIIIγ promotes the spatial segregation of microbiota and host in the intestine Science. 2011; 334 :255-258 Crossref Scopus (1110) PubMed Google Scholar ) and β-defensin on the skin ( Dutta et al., 2020 11. Dutta, S. ∙ Das, N. ∙ Mukherjee, P. Picking up a fight: fine tuning mitochondrial innate immune defenses against RNA viruses Front. Microbiol. 2020; 11 :1990 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, vitamin A derivatives drive the expression of human RETN (murine RELMs) through retinoic acid receptors (RARs), suggesting that flavivirus infections might modulate RELMα expression by interfering with TLR or RAR-related signaling in keratinocytes and sebocytes ( Dutta et al., 2020 11. Dutta, S. ∙ Das, N. ∙ Mukherjee, P. Picking up a fight: fine tuning mitochondrial innate immune defenses against RNA viruses Front. Microbiol. 2020; 11 :1990 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kao et al., 2018 23. Kao, Y.T. ∙ Lai, M.M.C. ∙ Yu, C.Y. How dengue virus circumvents innate immunity Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :2860 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sumikawa et al., 2006 34. Sumikawa, Y. ∙ Asada, H. ∙ Hoshino, K. ... Induction of β-defensin 3 in keratinocytes stimulated by bacterial lipopeptides through toll-like receptor 2 Microbes Infect. 2006; 8 :1513-1521 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Hematophagous arthropods’ host-seeking motivation in response to host cues directly determines the probability of arboviral transmission by vectors. In this study, we found that acetophenone volatilization manipulated by flavivirus infection rendered the infected hosts more attractive to Aedes mosquitoes, thereby enabling flaviviruses to effectively achieve their lifecycles. Dietary administration of a vitamin A derivative in flavivirus-infected animals reduced acetophenone volatilization by reshaping resident commensal bacteria on the host skin, which impaired flavivirus acquisition by interrupting mosquito host-seeking activity. A thorough understanding and interruption of vector-host interactions may offer insight to develop an effective strategy for controlling arboviral diseases.
First, our results are primarily derived from a laboratory mouse model. Because mouse skin physiology is quite different from that of human skin, the skin commensal microbial flora may also share differences between mice and humans. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that other commensal bacterial populations in the human skin, rather than the populations identified in this study, are regulated by flavivirus infection and constitute the major producers of acetophenone. Flavivirus-mediated changes in skin microbiota and acetophenone production remain to be investigated in human subjects. Second, RETN, as a homolog of murine RELMα, is predominantly expressed by keratinocytes and sebaceous glands of the human skin. RETN expression is driven by RAR signaling, and RETN exhibits antimicrobial activity to shape the composition of the skin microbiota. Nonetheless, the regulation of RETN in the skin of flavivirus-infected humans still requires further investigation.

The study did not generate new unique reagents.
Human volatile samples were collected with written informed consent from dengue patients with approval of the local ethics committee at the Ruili Hospital of Chinese Medicine and Dai Medicine in Yunnan province, China. The age and gender information of dengue patients and healthy donors was shown in Table S2 .
C57BL/6 mice deficient in type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG6 mice) were donated by the Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Mice were bred and maintained at the Tsinghua University animal facility in a pathogen-free environment. Six to eight weeks-old female mice were used for the animal studies ( De Moraes et al., 2014 9. De Moraes, C.M. ∙ Stanczyk, N.M. ∙ Betz, H.S. ... Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11079-11084 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ; McMeniman et al., 2014 26.

Multimodal integration of carbon dioxide and other sensory cues drives mosquito attraction to humans Cell. 2014; 156 :1060-1071 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). All animal experiments were approved by and performed under the guidelines of the Experimental Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of Tsinghua University.
Both A. aegypti (the Rockefeller, Mengla and Paraiba strains) and A. albopictus (the Jiangsu strain) mosquitoes were maintained on a sugar solution in a 27 °C environment with 80% humidity, according to standard rearing procedures.
Vero cells, which were originally isolated from a female Cercopithecus aethiops kidney, were purchased from ATCC. Vero cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 in DMEM (11965118, Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10099141, Gibco), 2 mM GlutaMAX (35050061, Gibco) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (15240-062, Invitrogen).
DENV2 (43 strain, AF204178 ) and ZIKV (PRVABC59 strain, KU501215 ) were passaged in Vero cells at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 in VP-SFM (11681-020, Gibco). The viral titers were determined by performing a plaque formation assay ( Zhu et al., 2019 44. Zhu, Y. ∙ Tong, L. ∙ Nie, K. ... Host serum iron modulates dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2405-2415 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Before each trial, female A. aegypti mosquitoes at 7-14 days post-eclosion were sorted under cold anesthesia at 4 °C and transferred into a small nylon cage (20 × 20 × 20 cm). All females used in these assays were mated previously but had not taken a blood meal. Females were fasted with no access to water for 16-24 h prior to host odor. During mosquito behavioral assays, AG6 mice were anesthetized with 0.75% pentobarbital (P3761, Sigma-Aldrich) in glass chambers or stimulus ports to avoid feces and urine interference. Three-cage olfactometers and two-port olfactometers were exploited in the behavioral assays. The three-cage olfactometer, modified from a previous study ( Khashaveh et al., 2020 24. Khashaveh, A. ∙ An, X. ∙ Shan, S. ... Deorphanization of an odorant receptor revealed new bioactive components for green mirid bug Apolygus lucorum (Hemiptera: Miridae) Pest Manag. Sci. 2020; 76 :1626-1638 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), consists of three transparent Perspex cages (30 × 30 × 30 cm). The cages are connected with 20-cm funnel-shaped arms. For each trial, 60 female Aedes mosquitoes were released in the middle cage for at least 30 min to acclimatize. Clean air was pushed through an activated charcoal filter and split into two streams with a flow rate of 1 l/min. The two-port olfactometer, modified from a previous study ( Degennaro et al., 2013 10. Degennaro, M. ∙ Mcbride, C.S. ∙ Seeholzer, L. ... orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET Nature. 2013; 498 :487-491 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), consisted of a large plexiglass box (60 × 60 × 80 cm) connected to two smaller cylindrical traps at one end (20 cm long, 10 cm inner diameter), which were in turn connected to two stimulus ports (30 cm long and 15 cm inner diameter) containing an odor source. During each trial, 60 female mosquitoes were released in a large plexiglass box for at least 30 min to acclimatize. The rate of clean air flow in the stimulus ports was 1 l/min. Each airstream passed through either glass chambers or stimulus ports containing an odor source (e.g., infected or healthy mice). Behavioral assays were performed under near-dark conditions. The number of mosquitoes in each cage or cylindrical trap was counted 30 min after the behavioral assays. To control possible spatial effects that interrupted the behavioral assays, the locations of treatment at each glass chamber or stimulus ports were switched after each trial.
For the mosquito attraction assay to the mice, the animals were intraperitoneally infected with 2 × 10 3 p.f.u. of either the DENV2 43 strain or ZIKV PRVABC59 strain. The mock mice were injected with an equal amount of PBS. To test the role of volatiles released from healthy and infected mice in mosquito attraction behavior, we modified the three-cage olfactometer, in which the air from the glass chamber was pumped into the filter element consisting of activated charcoal and Super Q 80/100 mesh (GEEQ-008613, CNW) to ensure volatiles were removed. Air with the removal of volatiles was pumped into the cages for the behavioral assays.
For the mosquito attraction assay to volatiles, 20 regulated volatile compounds were selected for further investigation. The roles of these compounds in mosquito attraction were examined in behavioral trials with the three-cage olfactometer described above. The 20 candidate compounds were dissolved in n -hexane (1.00795, Sigma-Aldrich). We tested them by applying 100 μL on the skin surface of AG6 mice or on the back of human hands. The control groups were wiped with an equal volume of n -hexane.
For the mosquito attraction assay to the bacteria, individual isolates of the bacterial strains were cultured in liquid Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for 3 d at 30 °C at 180 rpm, and then, the fresh fermentation supernatant was used for assays. One milliliter of fermentation supernatant was applied to the back and abdomen (total of approximately 10 cm 2 ) of AG6 mice using paintbrushes, and LB medium was used as a control. Each bacterial strain was replicated three times with 60 female mosquitoes per replicate.
For volatile collection from the mice, the animals were anesthetized by 0.75% pentobarbital and then placed into glass chambers (10 cm for the bottom diameter × 20 cm in height). One chamber contained 3 mice. The glass jar was tightly sealed with metal camps. Clean air, purified by passaging through an activated charcoal filter, was actively pumped through the chambers at a flow rate of 1 l/min with a vacuum pump. Volatiles emitted from healthy or DENV/ZIKV-infected mice were collected in a 10-mm-diameter glass tube with 100 mg of Super Q 80/100 mesh. Three periods were chosen per day for volatile collection: daytime (lights on, 9:00-11:00 AM, 3:00-5:00 PM) and nighttime (lights off, 7:00-11:00 PM). The collected volatile compounds were then extracted with 600 μl of n -hexane, stored at -80 °C and analyzed within 7 days by a GC-MS assay.
The dengue patients from outpatient services was clinically diagnosed by an immune colloidal gold kit against DENV non-structural protein-1 (NS1) antigen ( Guan et al., 2021 18. Guan, J. ∙ He, Z. ∙ Qin, M. ... Molecular characterization of the viral structural protein genes in the first outbreak of dengue virus type 2 in Hunan Province, inland China in 2018 BMC Infect. Dis. 2021; 21 :166 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). The information of dengue patients is showed in Table S2 . For volatile collection from human skin, the volunteers avoided spicy food, garlic, and alcohol and used nonperfumed soap ( Logan et al., 2008 25. Logan, J.G. ∙ Birkett, M.A. ∙ Clark, S.J. ... Identification of human-derived volatile chemicals that interfere with attraction of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes J. Chem. Ecol. 2008; 34 :308-322 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). We collected 10 volatile samples from either dengue patients or healthy donors. A PDMS Twister (011333-001-00, Gerstel) with a 1-cm length/1-mm phase thickness was used in this study. Before usage, the Twisters were conditioned at 290 °C under purified helium stream for 2 h using TDS2 desorption tubes (Thermal Desorption System) and stored in the original storage vials. Volatile compounds were collected from skin surfaces by a device designed especially for the purpose of volatile compound profiling ( Soini et al., 2006 33. Soini, H.A. ∙ Bruce, K.E. ∙ Klouckova, I. ... In situ surface sampling of biological objects and preconcentration of their volatiles for chromatographic analysis Anal. Chem. 2006; 78 :7161-7168 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). A preconditioned Twister with embedded internal standard was placed in the collection device ( Soini et al., 2006 33. Soini, H.A. ∙ Bruce, K.E. ∙ Klouckova, I. ... In situ surface sampling of biological objects and preconcentration of their volatiles for chromatographic analysis Anal. Chem. 2006; 78 :7161-7168 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), and two separate 5-cm-long stretches of the inner armpit skin in each volunteer were rolled over for 10 min with a Twister (10-cm 2 skin area). After collection, the Twister was subsequently dropped from the collection device and placed either in a clean thermal desorption tube for a GC-MS assay or in a capped Twister glass vial for -20 °C storage.
For the mosquito attraction assay to the volatiles released from dengue patients or healthy donors, we used PDMS stir bars to collect the volatiles from their armpits. To elute the human volatiles adsorbed on the PDMS stir bars, the PDMS stir bars were initially stirred at room temperature with 1 ml of n -hexane in sealed 12-ml vials (B7999-12A, Thermo Scientific) for 60 min while stirring at 700 rpm. n -Hexane, as a non-polar solvent, cannot extract polar compounds. To distinguish the impact of polar compounds on mosquito behavior from that of nonpolar extracts, we designed a two-step extraction protocol. We first used n -hexane to extract nonpolar compounds from the PDMS stir bars (designated the primary extract), and then methanol to elute polar compounds only (designated the secondary extract) ( Bedner and Saito, 2020 2. Bedner, M. ∙ Saito, K. Development of a liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry method for determining off-flavor compounds and its application toward marine recirculating aquaculture system monitoring and evaluation of aeration as a depuration approach J. Chromatogr. A. 2020; 1609 :460499 PubMed Google Scholar ). Both the extracts obtained from stir bars were stored at -80 °C before use. The volatile extracts obtained from the skin surface of DENV-infected or healthy donors was applied to 100 μl on filter paper (3 cm in diameter) in each behavioral assay, and an equal volume of solvent n -hexane (or methanol) was used as a control. Each assay was replicated three times with 60 female mosquitoes per replicate.
A GC/MS-QP2010 (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a nonpolar HP-5MS column (30-m × 0.25-mm internal diameter × 0.25-μm film thickness; 19091S-433, Agilent Technologies) was used to quantify the volatile compounds in the solvent-extracted and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) samples. The injector was held at 270 °C. The volume of injection was 1 μl for the AG6 mouse solvent-extracted volatiles. For detection of the SPME samples from the AG6 mice, the SPME fiber was inserted into the hot injector (270 °C) and exposed for 3 min to desorb volatiles collected on the fiber. The GC oven temperature was programmed from an initial temperature of 30 °C held for 3 min, ramped at 8 °C/min to 225 °C, and held isothermal for 10 min. The mass spectra ion source temperature was kept at 230 °C, and mass spectra were obtained at a mass to charge ratio (m/z) of 35-400. For GC-MS analysis of volatile compounds from the subjects, Twister with extracted volatile compounds was placed into a clean thermal desorption tube, and samples were directly analyzed by a thermal desorption (TDS-C506, Gerstel) gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC/MS-TQ8050, Shimadzu) (TD-GC-MS) system. The organics were thermally desorbed from the tube inside a Gerstel thermal desorption unit (Thermal desorption system, TDS3, Gerstel) in splitless flow mode with a helium flow of 50 ml/min. During thermal desorption, the temperature of TDS3 was ramped from 20 to 250 °C at a rate of 60 °C/min and isothermally held at 280 °C for 3 min. Organics desorbed from each tube were enriched by a Gerstel cooled injection system (CIS4, Gerstel) at -80 °C. After thermal desorption, organics enriched by CIS were thermally injected into GC-MS with a helium flow of 1 ml/min and a split ratio of 10.0 by heating the CIS from -80 to 280 °C at a rate of 12 °C/s followed by isothermal holding at 280 °C for 5 min. The GC oven thermal program and MS parameters of GC-MS were the same as those described in the mouse volatile compound analysis. Compounds were then identified by comparing deconvoluted mass spectra to spectra in the NIST11 spectral library (National Institute of Standards and Technologies). Absolute quantification of acetophenone released from the human armpit was determined by a standard curve.
Electroantennograms were used to record the antennal responses to candidate odorants. All female mosquitoes were collected for usage at 7-14 days after adult eclosion and were mated previously but had not taken a blood meal. The antennae of female adults were carefully excised at the base and terminal segments and immediately attached to the antenna holder with Signa Gel Electrode Gel (15-60, Parker Laboratories). All tested odorants were dissolved in n -hexane to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. Ten microliters of each chemical solution were loaded onto a filter paper strip (2 × 30 mm) and inserted into a glass Pasteur pipette (22.5-cm long, 6-mm inner diameter). Then, 10 μl of n -hexane alone was used as a blank control. A stimulus controller (CS-55, Syntech) could generate continuous air flow (30 ml/s) for air and odorant stimulant delivery. The antenna was exposed to constant charcoal-filtered humid air flow through a metal tube for 1 s. An interval of at least 1 min between puffs was applied to ensure antennal recovery. The antennal signal was recorded by the intelligent data acquisition controller (IDAC4, Syntech) connected to a computer. Odorants were purchased from companies as follows: 2-methyl-1-heptene (111058, Sigma-Aldrich), 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene (D1258, TCI), acetophenone (42163, Sigma-Aldrich), 4-methylbenzaldehyde (41423, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,3-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)benzene (272051, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-ethylhexylbenzoate (B1977, TCI), 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane (T0664, TCI), decanal (D7384, Sigma-Aldrich), diisobutyl phthalate (152641, Sigma-Aldrich), ethylbenzene (03079, Sigma-Aldrich), 2,2,4-trimethylhexane (92470, Sigma-Aldrich), menthol (63660, Sigma-Aldrich), methyl palmitate (P5177, Sigma-Aldrich), methyl tetradecanoate (M3378, Sigma-Aldrich), 1-methylnaphthalene (45795, Sigma-Aldrich), o -xylene (95660, Sigma-Aldrich), 2,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol (D924217, Macklin), styrene (S4972, Sigma-Aldrich), and toluene (89680, Sigma-Aldrich). Then, 5-methyl-undecane (purity > 95%) was purchased from Regent Science Industry Limited. Next, acetophenone, decanal and styrene were dissolved in n -hexane at a series of concentrations. Each dose of 3 odorants was tested twice against six individual antennae. The blank controls were used at the beginning and end of the stimulus series. The EAG amplitudes were calculated by subtracting the amplitudes of blank controls.
The CO 2 emitted from the healthy and infected mice was measured by a metabolic cage (PhenoMaster, TSE system). After the AG6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with PBS or infected by the viruses, the mice were placed in metabolic cages immediately. Each mouse was recorded in a single cage, and the metabolic data were recorded continuously for 8 days. AG6 mouse body temperature was measured by a noncontact infrared thermometer (BTN100CN, Braun). Temperature was measured in the perianal region with a searchlight indicating the measured area ( Mei et al., 2018 27. Mei, J. ∙ Riedel, N. ∙ Grittner, U. ... Body temperature measurement in mice during acute illness: implantable temperature transponder versus surface infrared thermometry Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :3526 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each mouse was measured once per day. For the mice inoculated with LPS (L2630, Sigma-Aldrich), the body temperature was measured each hour over a time course.
The amount of acetophenone volatilized from AG6 mouse skin was detected by an SPME assay. A gray SPME fiber with a polymeric stationary phase coated onto fused silica fiber (57328-U, Supelco) was used to collect the volatiles. Before collecting the volatiles, the SPME fiber was inserted into the hot injector of the GC-MS apparatus (held at 270 °C) and exposed for 30 min to desorb compounds on the fiber. In brief, three healthy or DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice were anesthetized and placed into a glass jar (10-cm bottom diameter × 20-cm height), and fibers (DVB/CAR/PDMS, 50/30 μm) attached to a solid-phase microextraction holder (57330-U, Supelco) were introduced into the glass jar. Exposing the SPME needle close to the mice for 30 min collected mouse volatiles, and a filter paper strip (5 × 20 mm) cleaned by Soxhlet extraction containing 40 ng of nonyl acetate (A0041, TCI) dissolved in n -hexane was added to each glass jar as an internal standard. After collection, the SPME fiber was rotated back to the Mannual Holder and desorbed by GC-MS immediately. The same GC-MS thermal program was used as described previously. To determine the exact amount of acetophenone emitted from the mice, acetophenone standards at different amounts were used to develop standard curves for quantifying the amount of acetophenone released.
For removal of the skin microbiota from AG6 mice, a sonication brush was exploited on the mouse skin, and the brush head was sprayed with 70% alcohol ( Wang et al., 2018 41. Wang, Y. ∙ Tan, X. ∙ Xi, C. ... Removal of Staphylococcus aureus from skin using a combination antibiofilm approach NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes. 2018; 4 :16 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). The skin of each mouse was cleaned twice with the same approach. For removal of the gut microbiota, the mice were fed drinking water containing ampicillin (1 g/l; A5354, Sigma-Aldrich), vancomycin (500 mg/l; V8050, Solarbio Life Sciences), neomycin sulfate (1 g/l; N8090, Solarbio Life Sciences) and metronidazole (1 g/l; M8060, Solarbio Life Sciences) for two weeks to remove the gut microbiota from their intestines ( Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004 30. Rakoff-Nahoum, S. ∙ Paglino, J. ∙ Eslami-Varzaneh, F. ... Recognition of commensal microflora by toll-like receptors is required for intestinal homeostasis Cell. 2004; 118 :229-241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3510) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Skin microbiota samples were collected from the mice’s abdomens. In brief, sterile small polyester swabs (STX764T, Texwipe) were prepared in tubes with 1 ml of PBS and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (T8787, Sigma-Aldrich). The swabs were completely moisturized with sterile solution. The selected area (1 cm × 2 cm) was swabbed from right to left and from up to down several times while constantly rotating the swabs. Then, the swab tubes were vortexed for 30 s to elute the bacteria from the swabs. The solution was diluted and plated on Columbia Blood Agar Medium (HB0124, Qingdao Hope Bio-Technology). The bacterial colonies were counted after incubation at 37 °C for 36 h. For the gut microbiota, fresh feces were collected and homogenized in 2-ml sterile tubes with PBS. The contents were diluted and plated on Columbia Blood Agar Medium for counting bacterial colonies ( Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004 30. Rakoff-Nahoum, S. ∙ Paglino, J. ∙ Eslami-Varzaneh, F. ... Recognition of commensal microflora by toll-like receptors is required for intestinal homeostasis Cell. 2004; 118 :229-241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3510) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Sterile small polyester swabs were used to collect the bacteria from the AG6 mouse skin surfaces. The swabs were moisturized in tubes containing 1 ml of PBS and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. To obtain mouse skin bacterial strains, we used moist swabs to collect the total skin surface. After collection, the swab was thoroughly vortexed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, the solution was diluted and cultivated as described in a previous study ( Fleming et al., 2021 13. Fleming, E. ∙ Pabst, V. ∙ Scholar, Z. ... Cultivation of common bacterial species and strains from human skin, oral, and gut microbiota BMC Microbiol. 2021; 21 :278 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the bacterial isolate was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing.
Skin bacteria were collected by rubbing a sterile cotton swab for 1 min over 2 cm 2 of the mouse abdomen. Then, the cotton swabs were put back into the tube, vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min to collect the skin bacteria. Skin bacterial DNA was extracted using a Bacterial DNA Kit (D3350-1, Omega) following the manual. The purity and quality of the genomic DNA were checked on 1% agarose gels and a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene was amplified with the primers 338F (5’-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3’) and 806R (5’-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3’). For each sample, an 8-digit barcode sequence was added to the 5’ end of the forward and reverse primers provided by Allwegene Company (Beijing, China). The PCR system contained 12.5 μl of 2 × Taq PCR MasterMix, 3 μl of BSA (2 ng/μl), 1 μl of forward primer (5 μM), 1 μl of reverse primer (5 μM), 2 μl of template DNA, and 5.5 μl of H 2 O. The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 28 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 50 s and 72 °C for 45 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were purified using an Agencourt AMPure XP Kit (A63880, Beckman). Deep sequencing was performed on the MiSeq platform at Allwegene Company (Beijing, China). Image analysis, base calling and error estimation were performed using an Illumina Analysis Pipeline Version 2.6. The raw data were analyzed with an in-house filtering protocol of Allwegene. The sequencing data were deposited in the Short Read Archive (SRA) with BioProject IDs: PRJNA801082.
Individual bacterial strains were grown in a flask containing 100 ml of LB liquid medium. The flasks were incubated for 3 d at 30 °C and 180 rpm. The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to discard the cell mass, and the liquid broth was retained at -80 °C for subsequent experiments. The amount of acetophenone from bacterial strains was investigated through the SPME method as described before. In brief, the extractions were performed by 12-ml vials filled with a 5-ml bacterial culture containing a stir bar and 0.05 g of Na 2 SO 4 and 4 ng of 4-methylacetophenone (59932, Sigma-Aldrich) as an internal standard. The fiber was inserted into the bacterial culture with constant magnetic stirring at 700 rpm for 30 min. The volatiles extracted from the fresh LB liquid medium were used as a control. After extraction, the SPME fiber was directly inserted into the front inlet of GC-MS and desorbed for 3 min. The gas chromatograph data acquisition parameters were the same as those described above. The amounts of acetophenone were quantified by the use of the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Each sample was analyzed three times.
Mouse skin was homogenized in PIERCEIPLYSISBUFFER (87787, Thermo Fisher) containing a complete (EDTA-free) protease inhibitor (4693132001, Roche). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a 4-20% gradient SDS–PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS, the membranes were incubated at 37 °C 2h with anti-RELMa antibody (ab39626, Abcam) or anti-GAPDH antibody (60004-1-Ig, Proteintech). Membranes were then incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP. Membranes were visualized by a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Touch system.
Isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid; R3255, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO (D2650, Sigma-Aldrich) and further diluted in corn oil (JS50856, JSENB). AG6 mice with either DENV2 or ZIKV infection were treated by oral gavage for 3 consecutive days with 1 mg of isotretinoin in 10% DMSO/corn oil or 10% DMSO/corn oil as controls.
The mRELMα and RETN proteins were generated using the E. coli BL21 DE3 strain. The mRELMα- and RETN-encoding genes were PCR-amplified from codon-optimized genes (RuiBiotech, Beijing, China). PCR-amplified products were purified and cloned into a pET-28a (+) expression vector (69864-3, Novagen). The recombinant mRELMα and RETN proteins in bacterial lysates were purified using a TALON Purification Kit (635515, Clontech).
Bacteria were grown in LB culture, including B. flexus , B. megaterium , B. proteolyticus , B. wiedmannii , Enterococcus faecalis , Escherichia fergusonii , Staphylococcus sciuri , Staphylococcus xylosus and Paenibacillus lautus . Bacterial cultures were grown to logarithmic phase and then pelleted washed twice by PBS (10010002, Gibco). The initial bacterial concentration was 10 3 cfu/ml. Bacteria were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in assay buffer with varying concentrations of recombinant protein or BSA (A1933, Sigma-Aldrich). Colony forming units were quantified by dilution plating onto LB agar plates.
For each trial, 30-40 females were released into the cage (30 × 30 × 30 cm) and acclimated for 10 min. After the acclimatization period, an anesthetized AG6 mouse with either DENV2 or ZIKV infection was placed into the center of the cages, and mosquitoes were given the opportunity to blood-feed for 15 min to determine the effects of acetophenone-producing bacteria on the seeking behavior of the mosquitoes. AG6 mice infected with either DENV2 or ZIKV were treated daily with 1 mg of isotretinoin in 10% DMSO/corn oil with oral gavage. The infected animals were administered 10% DMSO/corn oil as a negative control. The experimental environment was under a near-dark condition. After each trial, the cage with mosquitoes was placed at 4 °C, and the anesthetized mouse was removed from the cage. Subsequently, the numbers of blood-fed mosquitoes and weights were recorded. Blood-feeding mosquitoes were reared for an additional 8 days for viral detection by qPCR.
Total RNA was extracted from DENV2- or ZIKV-infected AG6 mouse skin and uninfected mice. The samples were delivered to the BGI Group (Shenzhen, China) for commercial BGISEQ-500 RNA-seq services and data analysis. Clean reads were mapped to a Mus_musculus (NCBI_GCF_000001635.26_GRCm38.p6) genome database using SOAPaligner/SOAP2 mismatches. The number of clean reads for each gene was calculated and then normalized to the reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, which correlates to the read numbers with gene expression levels. The sequencing data were deposited in the Short Read Archive (NCBI) under accession number GSE195569 .
Total RNA was collected from homogenized mosquitoes using a RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (170-8890, Bio-Rad). Viral genomes and genes were quantified by qPCR. The primers and probes used for these analyses are shown in Table S5 . Gene expression was normalized to that of the A. aegypti actin gene ( AAEL011197 ) or Mus musculus actin gene ( NM_007393.5 ).
Animals were randomly allocated into different groups. Mosquitoes that died before counting and measurement were excluded from the analysis. The investigators were not blinded to the allocation during the experiments or to the outcome assessment. Descriptive statistics are provided in the figure legends. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 statistical software.
