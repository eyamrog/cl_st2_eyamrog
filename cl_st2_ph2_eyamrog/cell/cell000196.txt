Title: Robust T Cell Immunity in Convalescent Individuals with Asymptomatic or Mild COVID-19


Abstract: Summary

SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19. Here, we systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.

Section: Introduction

The world changed in December 2019 with the emergence of a new zoonotic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes a variety of clinical syndromes collectively termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At present, there is no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and the excessive inflammation associated with severe COVID-19 can lead to respiratory failure, septic shock, and ultimately, death ( Guan et al., 2020 14. Guan, W.J. ∙ Ni, Z.Y. ∙ Hu, Y. ..., China Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19 Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China N. Engl. J.

The overall mortality rate is 0.5%–3.5% ( Guan et al., 2020 14. Guan, W.J. ∙ Ni, Z.Y. ∙ Hu, Y. ..., China Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19 Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China N. Engl. J.

However, most people seem to be affected less severely and remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms during COVID-19 ( He et al., 2020b 17. He, X. ∙ Lau, E.H.Y. ∙ Wu, P. ... Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :672-675 Crossref Scopus (2924) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2020 44.

It will therefore be critical for public health reasons to determine whether people with milder forms of COVID-19 develop robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
Global efforts are currently underway to map the determinants of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. Recent data have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates near-complete protection against rechallenge in rhesus macaques ( Chandrashekar et al., 2020 9. Chandrashekar, A. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Martinot, A.J. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against rechallenge in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :812-817 Crossref Scopus (630) PubMed Google Scholar ), and similarly, there is limited evidence of reinfection in humans with previously documented COVID-19 ( Kirkcaldy et al., 2020 22. Kirkcaldy, R.D. ∙ King, B.A. ∙ Brooks, J.T. COVID-19 and Postinfection Immunity: Limited Evidence, Many Remaining Questions JAMA. 2020; Published online May 11, 2020 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further work is therefore required to define the mechanisms that underlie these observations and evaluate the durability of protective immune responses elicited by primary infection with SARS-CoV-2. Most correlative studies of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 have focused on induction of neutralizing antibodies ( Hotez et al., 2020 18. Hotez, P.J. ∙ Corry, D.B. ∙ Strych, U. ...

However, antibody responses are not detectable in all patients, especially those with less severe forms of COVID-19 ( Long et al., 2020 26. Long, Q.X. ∙ Tang, X.J. ∙ Shi, Q.L. ...

False Negative Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Infection — Challenges and Implications N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :e38 Crossref Scopus (575) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous work has also shown that memory B cell responses tend to be short lived after infection with SARS-CoV-1 ( Channappanavar et al., 2014 10. Channappanavar, R. ∙ Fett, C. ∙ Zhao, J. ...

Channappanavar, R. ∙ Fett, C. ∙ Zhao, J. ... Virus-specific memory CD8 T cells provide substantial protection from lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection J. Virol. 2014; 88 :11034-11044 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ).
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have been identified in humans ( Grifoni et al., 2020 13. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ... Targets of T Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus in Humans with COVID-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals Cell. 2020; 181 :1489-1501.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2560) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ni et al., 2020 30.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2-Specific Humoral and Cellular Immunity in COVID-19 Convalescent Individuals Immunity. 2020; 52 :971-977.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (778) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has nonetheless remained unclear to what extent various features of the T cell immune response associate with serostatus and the clinical course of COVID-19. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in outcome-defined cohorts of donors (total n = 206) from Sweden, which has experienced a more open spread of COVID-19 than many other countries in Europe ( Habib, 2020 15. Habib, H. Has Sweden’s controversial covid-19 strategy been successful? BMJ. 2020; 369 :m2376 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Section: Results

Our preliminary analyses showed that the absolute numbers and relative frequencies of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were unphysiologically low in patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 ( Figures 1 A, S1 A, and S1B). This finding has been reported previously ( He et al., 2020a 16. He, R. ∙ Lu, Z. ∙ Zhang, L. ... The clinical course and its correlated immune status in COVID-19 pneumonia J. Clin. Virol. 2020; 127 :104361 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2020 25. Liu, J. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Liu, J. ... Longitudinal characteristics of lymphocyte responses and cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients EBioMedicine. 2020; 55 :102763 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1193) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then used a 29-color flow cytometry panel to assess the phenotypic landscape of these immune perturbations in direct comparisons with healthy blood donors and individuals who had recovered from mild COVID-19 acquired early during the pandemic (February–March 2020). Cohort demographics are described in the STAR Methods section. None of these variables were associated with disease severity. The following parameters were measured in each sample: viability, C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7), cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, CD25, CD27, CD28, CD38, CD39, CD45RA, CD69, CD95, CD127, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5), granzyme B, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, Ki-67, lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), perforin, T cell factor 1 (TCF1), T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin (Ig) and ITIM domains (TIGIT), T cell Ig and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility group box factor (TOX), and natural killer cell receptor 2B4. Unbiased principal component analysis (PCA) revealed clear segregation between memory T cells from patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 and memory T cells from convalescent individuals and healthy blood donors ( Figure 1 B), driven largely by expression of CD38, CD69, Ki-67, and PD-1 in the CD4 + compartment and expression of CD38, CD39, CD69, CTLA-4, HLA-DR, Ki-67, LAG-3, and TIM-3 in the CD8 + compartment ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 C).
To extend these findings, we concatenated all memory CD4 + T cells and all memory CD8 + T cells from healthy blood donors, convalescent individuals, and patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19. Phenotypically related cells were identified using the clustering algorithm PhenoGraph, and marker expression patterns were visualized using the dimensionality reduction algorithm Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Distinct topographical clusters were apparent in each group ( Figures 1 D, S2 A, and S2B). In particular, memory CD8 + T cells from patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 expressed a distinct cluster of markers associated with activation and the cell cycle, including CD38, HLA-DR, Ki-67, and PD-1 ( Figures 1 D and S2 A). A similar pattern was observed among memory CD4 + T cells from patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 ( Figure S2 B). These findings were confirmed via manual gating of the flow cytometry data ( Figure 1 E). Correlative analyses further demonstrated that the activated/cycling phenotype was strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels and various clinical parameters, including age, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, albumin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and myoglobin ( Figures S2 C and S2D), but less strongly associated with plasma levels of various inflammatory markers, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ( Table S1 ).
Unphysiologically high expression frequencies of CD38, potentially driven by a highly inflammatory environment, were observed consistently among memory CD8 + T cells from patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 ( Figures S3 A and S3B). In line with these data, we found that CD8 + T cells specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) more commonly expressed CD38, but not HLA-DR, Ki-67, or PD-1, in patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 compared with convalescent individuals and healthy blood donors, indicating limited bystander activation and proliferation during the early phase of infection with SARS-CoV-2 ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S3 C). Of note, actively proliferating CD8 + T cells, defined by expression of Ki-67, exhibited a predominant CCR7 − CD27 + CD28 + CD45RA − CD127 − phenotype in patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 ( Figure S3 D), as reported previously in the context of vaccination and other viral infections ( Buggert et al., 2018 7. Buggert, M. ∙ Nguyen, S. ∙ Salgado-Montes de Oca, G. ... Identification and characterization of HIV-specific resident memory CD8 + T cells in human lymphoid tissue Sci. Immunol. 2018; 3 eaar4526 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miller et al., 2008 29. Miller, J.D. ∙ van der Most, R.G. ∙ Akondy, R.S. ... Human effector and memory CD8 + T cell responses to smallpox and yellow fever vaccines Immunity. 2008; 28 :710-722 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the basis of these findings, we used overlapping peptides spanning the immunogenic domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19. A vast majority of responding CD4 + and CD8 + T cells displayed an activated/cycling (CD38 + HLA-DR + Ki67 + PD-1 + ) phenotype ( Figure 2 C). These results were confirmed using an activation-induced marker (AIM) assay to measure upregulation of CD69 and 4-1BB (CD137), suggesting that most CD38 + PD-1 + CD8 + T cells were specific for SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2 D).
In further experiments, we used HLA class I tetramers as probes to detect CD8 + T cells specific for the predicted optimal epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S3 E; Table S2 ). A vast majority of tetramer + CD8 + T cells in the acute phase of infection, but not during convalescence, displayed an activated/cycling phenotype ( Figure 2 E). In general, early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cell populations were characterized by expression of immune activation molecules (CD38, HLA-DR, and Ki-67), inhibitory receptors (PD-1 and TIM-3), and cytotoxic molecules (granzyme B and perforin), whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cell populations were skewed toward an early differentiated memory (CCR7 + CD127 + CD45RA −/+ TCF1 + ) phenotype ( Figure 2 F). Importantly, the expression frequencies of CCR7 and CD45RA among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells were positively correlated with the number of symptom-free days after infection (CCR7: r = 0.79, p = 0.001; CD45RA: r = 0.70, p = 0.008), whereas the expression frequency of granzyme B among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells was inversely correlated with the number of symptom-free days after infection (r = 0.70, p = 0.007) ( Figure 2 G). Time from exposure was therefore associated with emergence of stem-like memory SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells.
On the basis of these observations, we quantified functional SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell responses across five distinct cohorts, including healthy individuals who donated blood before or during the pandemic, family members who shared a household with convalescent individuals and were exposed at the time of symptomatic disease, and individuals in the convalescent phase after mild or severe COVID-19. We detected potentially cross-reactive T cell responses directed against the spike and/or membrane proteins in 28% of healthy individuals who donated blood before the pandemic, consistent with previous reports ( Grifoni et al., 2020 13. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ... Targets of T Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus in Humans with COVID-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals Cell. 2020; 181 :1489-1501.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2560) PubMed Google Scholar ; Le Bert et al., 2020 23. Le Bert, N. ∙ Tan, A.T. ∙ Kunasegaran, K. ... SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls Nature. 2020; Published online July 15, 2020 Crossref Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ), but nucleocapsid reactivity was notably absent in this cohort ( Figures 3 A, S4 A, and S4B). The highest response frequencies against any of these three proteins were observed in convalescent individuals who experienced severe COVID-19 (100%). Progressively lower response frequencies were observed in convalescent individuals with a history of mild COVID-19 (87%), exposed family members (67%), and healthy individuals who donated blood during the pandemic (46%) ( Figure 3 A).
To assess the functional capabilities of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in convalescent individuals, we stimulated PBMCs with the overlapping spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid peptide sets and measured a surrogate marker of degranulation (CD107a) along with production of interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-2, and TNF ( Figures 3 B and 3C). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + T cells predominantly expressed IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF ( Figure 3 B), whereas SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells predominantly expressed IFN-γ and mobilized CD107a ( Figure 3 C). We then used the AIM assay to determine the functional polarization of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + T cells. Interestingly, spike-specific CD4 + T cells were skewed toward a circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) profile, suggesting a key role in the generation of potent antibody responses, whereas membrane-specific and nucleocapsid-specific CD4 + T cells were skewed toward a Th1 or a Th1/Th17 profile ( Figures 3 D, S5 A, and S5B).
In a final series of experiments, we assessed the recall capabilities of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in convalescent individuals, exposed family members, and healthy blood donors. Proliferative responses were identified by tracking the progressive dilution of a cytoplasmic dye (CellTrace Violet [CTV]) after stimulation with the overlapping spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid peptide sets, and functional responses to the same antigens were evaluated 5 days later by measuring the production of IFN-γ ( Blom et al., 2013 4. Blom, K. ∙ Braun, M. ∙ Ivarsson, M.A. ... Temporal dynamics of the primary human T cell response to yellow fever virus 17D as it matures from an effector- to a memory-type response J.

Immunol. 2014; 192 :4685-4696 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Anamnestic responses in the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell compartments, quantified as a function of CTV low IFN-γ + events ( Figure 4 A), were detected in most convalescent individuals (mild COVID-19 [MC] = 96%, severe COVID-19 [SC] = 100%) and exposed family members (92%) ( Figures 4 B and 4C). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + T cell responses were proportionately larger overall than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cell responses (exposed family members = 1.8-fold, MC = 1.4-fold, SC = 1.8-fold) ( Figure 4 D). In addition, most IFN-γ + SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + T cells produced TNF, and most IFN-γ + SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells expressed granzyme B and perforin ( Figure 4 E).
Serological evaluations revealed a strong positive correlation between IgG responses directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and IgG responses directed against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (r = 0.82, p < 0.001) ( Figure S5 C). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses were present in seronegative individuals, albeit at lower frequencies compared with seropositive individuals (41% versus 99%, respectively) ( Figure 4 F). These discordant responses were nonetheless pronounced in some convalescent individuals with a history of mild COVID-19 (3 of 31), exposed family members (9 of 28), and healthy individuals who donated blood during the pandemic (5 of 31) ( Figures 4 F and S5 D), often targeting the internal (nucleocapsid) and surface antigens (spike and/or membrane) of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 4 G). Higher frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were also found in exposed seronegative family members compared with unexposed donors ( Figure S5 E). Potent memory T cell responses were therefore elicited in the absence or presence of circulating antibodies, consistent with a non-redundant role as key determinants of immune protection against COVID-19 ( Chandrashekar et al., 2020 9. Chandrashekar, A. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Martinot, A.J. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against rechallenge in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :812-817 Crossref Scopus (630) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Section: Discussion

We are currently facing the biggest global health emergency in decades, namely the devastating outbreak of COVID-19. In the absence of a protective vaccine, it will be critical to determine whether exposed and/or infected people, especially those with asymptomatic or very mild forms of the disease who likely act inadvertently as major transmitters, develop robust adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 ( Long et al., 2020 26. Long, Q.X. ∙ Tang, X.J. ∙ Shi, Q.L. ... Clinical and immunological assessment of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1200-1204 Crossref Scopus (2028) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this study, we used a systematic approach to map cellular and humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19, individuals in the convalescent phase after mild or severe COVID-19, exposed family members, and healthy individuals who donated blood before (2019) or during the pandemic (2020). Individuals in the convalescent phase after mild COVID-19 were traced after returning to Sweden from endemic areas (mostly northern Italy). These donors exhibited robust memory T cell responses months after infection, even in the absence of detectable circulating antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2, that may contribute to protection against severe COVID-19.
We found that T cell activation, characterized by expression of CD38, was a hallmark of acute COVID-19. Similar findings have been reported previously in the absence of specificity data ( Huang et al., 2020 19. Huang, C. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, X. ...

A single-cell atlas of the peripheral immune response in patients with severe COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1070-1076 Crossref Scopus (988) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many of these T cells also expressed HLA-DR, Ki-67, and PD-1, indicating a combined activation/cycling phenotype, which correlated with early SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels and, to a lesser extent, plasma levels of various inflammatory markers. Our data also showed that many activated/cycling T cells in the acute phase were functionally replete and specific for SARS-CoV-2. Equivalent functional profiles have been observed early after immunization with successful vaccines ( Blom et al., 2013 4. Blom, K. ∙ Braun, M. ∙ Ivarsson, M.A. ...

Med. 2007; 204 :1405-1416 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, the expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, including PD-1, likely indicates early activation rather than exhaustion ( Zheng et al., 2020a 54.

In line with these observations, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells acquired an early differentiated memory (CCR7 + CD127 + CD45RA −/+ TCF1 + ) phenotype in the convalescent phase, as reported previously in the context of other viral infections and successful vaccines ( Blom et al., 2013 4.

Immunization with vaccinia virus induces polyfunctional and phenotypically distinctive CD8 + T cell responses J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204 :1405-1416 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells generated anamnestic responses to cognate antigens in the convalescent phase, characterized by extensive proliferation and polyfunctionality. Of particular note, we detected similar memory T cell responses directed against the internal (nucleocapsid) and surface proteins (membrane and/or spike) in some individuals lacking detectable circulating antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, almost twice as many healthy individuals who donated blood during the pandemic had memory T cell responses versus antibody responses, implying that seroprevalence as an indicator may underestimate the extent of adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.
Our study was cross-sectional in nature and limited in terms of clinical follow-up and overall donor numbers in each outcome-defined group. It therefore remains to be determined whether robust memory T cell responses in the absence of detectable circulating antibodies can protect against severe forms of COVID-19. This scenario has nonetheless been inferred from previous studies of MERS and SARS-CoV-1 ( Channappanavar et al., 2014 10. Channappanavar, R. ∙ Fett, C. ∙ Zhao, J. ...

Lack of peripheral memory B cell responses in recovered patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: a six-year follow-up study J. Immunol. 2011; 186 :7264-7268 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antibody responses have also been shown to wane after infection with SARS-CoV-2 ( Ibarrondo et al., 2020 20. Ibarrondo, F.J. ∙ Fulcher, J.A. ∙ Goodman-Meza, D. ... Rapid Decay of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Persons with Mild Covid-19 N. Engl. J.

Clinical and immunological assessment of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1200-1204 Crossref Scopus (2028) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that transient humoral immunity is a general feature of coronavirus infections ( Callow et al., 1990 8. Callow, K.A. ∙ Parry, H.F. ∙ Sergeant, M. ... The time course of the immune response to experimental coronavirus infection of man Epidemiol. Infect. 1990; 105 :435-446 Crossref Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the fact that memory B cells ( Juno et al., 2020 21. Juno, J.A. ∙ Tan, H.X. ∙ Lee, W.S. ... Humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell responses in recovered patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; Published online July 13, 2020 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ) and memory T cells are generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that natural infection may elicit protection from severe COVID-19. In line with these observations, none of the convalescent individuals in this study, including those with previous mild disease, experienced further episodes of COVID-19.
Of note, we detected cross-reactive T cell responses directed against the spike and/or membrane proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 28% of unexposed healthy blood donors, consistent with a high degree of pre-existing immunity in the general population ( Braun et al., 2020 5.

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls Nature. 2020; Published online July 15, 2020 Crossref Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, these particular data were derived from cryopreserved samples, so this figure might be considered as a lower bound estimate of overall prevalence ( Owen et al., 2007 31. Owen, R.E. ∙ Sinclair, E. ∙ Emu, B. ... Loss of T cell responses following long-term cryopreservation J. Immunol. Methods. 2007; 326 :93-115 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, our findings most likely reflect widespread exposure to seasonal coronaviruses, which could shape the subsequent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. As such, it remains likely that a fraction of the anamnestic SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response was initially induced by seasonal coronaviruses in seronegative individuals ( Mateus et al., 2020 28. Mateus, J. ∙ Grifoni, A. ∙ Tarke, A. ... Selective and cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes in unexposed humans Science. 2020; Published online August 4, 2020 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is also tempting to speculate that such responses may provide at least partial protection against SARS-CoV-2, given that pre-existing T cell immunity has been associated with beneficial outcomes after challenge with the pandemic influenza virus strain H1N1 ( Sridhar et al., 2013 40. Sridhar, S. ∙ Begom, S. ∙ Bermingham, A. ... Cellular immune correlates of protection against symptomatic pandemic influenza Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1305-1312 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilkinson et al., 2012 46. Wilkinson, T.M. ∙ Li, C.K. ∙ Chui, C.S. ... Preexisting influenza-specific CD4 + T cells correlate with disease protection against influenza challenge in humans Nat. Med. 2012; 18 :274-280 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Collectively, our data provide a functional and phenotypic map of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity across the full spectrum of exposure, infection, and disease. The observation that many individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 had highly durable and functionally replete memory T cell responses, not uncommonly in the absence of detectable humoral responses, further suggests that natural exposure or infection could prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.

Maximal disease severity was assessed using the NIH Ordinal Scale and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) ( Beigel et al., 2020 2. Beigel, J.H. ∙ Tomashek, K.M. ∙ Dodd, L.E. ...

The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) JAMA. 2016; 315 :801-810 Crossref Scopus (15913) PubMed Google Scholar ). The NIH Ordinal Scale was defined as follows: (1) not hospitalized with no limitation of activities; (2) not hospitalized with limitation of activities and/or home oxygen requirement; (3) hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care; (4) hospitalized and not requiring supplemental oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care; (5) hospitalized requiring supplemental oxygen; (6) hospitalized requiring non-invasive ventilation or the use of high-flow oxygen devices; (7) hospitalized receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and (8) death.
Donors were assigned to one of seven groups for the purposes of this study. AS: patients with acute severe disease requiring hospitalization in the high dependency or intensive care unit, with low-flow oxygen support (< 10 L/min), high-flow oxygen support, or invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 17). These patients had a median NIH Ordinal Scale score of 7 (IQR 6–7) and a median SOFA score of 6 (IQR 3–6) at the time of sampling 12–17 days after disease onset (47% were viremic, and 82% were antibody-seropositive for SARS-CoV-2). AM: patients with acute moderate disease requiring hospitalization and low-flow oxygen support (0–3 L/min; n = 10). These patients had a median NIH Ordinal Scale score of 5 (IQR 5–5) and a median SOFA score of 1 (IQR 1–1) at the time of sampling 11–14 days after disease onset (40% were viremic, and 50% were antibody-seropositive for SARS-CoV-2). SC: individuals in the convalescent phase after severe disease (n = 26). Samples were collected 42–58 days after disease onset, corresponding to 3–21 days after resolution of symptoms (100% were antibody-seropositive for SARS-CoV-2). MC: individuals in the convalescent phase after mild disease (n = 40). Samples were collected 49–64 days after disease onset, corresponding to 25–53 days after resolution of symptoms (85% were antibody-seropositive for SARS-CoV-2). Exp: family members who shared a household with donors in groups MC or SC (n = 30). These individuals were exposed at the time of symptomatic disease (21% remained asymptomatic, and 63% were antibody-seropositive for SARS-CoV-2). 2020 BD: individuals who donated blood at the Karolinska University Hospital in May 2020 (during the pandemic; n = 55). 2019 BD: individuals who donated blood at the Karolinska University Hospital between July and September 2019 (before the pandemic; n = 28).
PBMCs were isolated from heparin-coated tubes (groups AS, AM, SC, MC, Exp, and 2020 BD) or citrate-anticoagulated buffy coats (group 2019 BD). A separate serum separator tube was collected from each donor. All donors provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Donor characteristics are summarized in Table S3 , and immunological assay breakdowns are summarized in Table S4 .
PBMCs were isolated from venous blood samples via standard density gradient centrifugation and used immediately (groups AS, AM, SC, MC, Exp, and 2020 BD) or after cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen (group 2019 BD). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 μM EDTA (FACS buffer) and stained with PE-conjugated or BV421-conjugated HLA class I tetramers and/or anti-CCR7–APC-Cy7 (clone G043H7; BioLegend) for 10 min at 37°C. Other surface markers were detected via the subsequent addition of directly conjugated antibodies at pre-titrated concentrations for 20 min at room temperature, and viable cells were identified by exclusion using a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then washed again in FACS buffer and fixed/permeabilized using a FoxP3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience). Intracellular markers were detected via the addition of directly conjugated antibodies at pre-titrated concentrations for 1 hr at 4°C. Stained cells were fixed in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Biotium) and stored at 4°C. Samples were acquired using a FACSymphony A5 (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with FlowJo software version 10.6.1 (FlowJo LLC). Gating strategies were described previously ( Buggert et al., 2014 6. Buggert, M. ∙ Norström, M.M. ∙ Salemi, M. ... Functional avidity and IL-2/perforin production is linked to the emergence of mutations within HLA-B ∗ 5701-restricted epitopes and HIV-1 disease progression J.

Identification and characterization of HIV-specific resident memory CD8 + T cells in human lymphoid tissue Sci. Immunol. 2018; 3 eaar4526 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Core gates included singlet isolation (FSC-H versus FSC-A), live CD3 selection (CD3 versus Aqua, CD14, and CD19), lymphocyte enrichment (SSC-A versus FSC-A), CD4 or CD8 selection (CD4 versus CD8). Detailed gating strategies for individual markers are depicted in the relevant figures.
Peptides corresponding to known optimal epitopes derived from CMV (pp65) and EBV (BZLF1 and EBNA-1), overlapping peptides spanning the immunogenic domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Prot_S), membrane (Prot_M), and nucleocapsid proteins (Prot_N), and optimal peptides for the manufacture of HLA class I tetramers were synthesized at > 95% purity. Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted at a stock concentration of 10 mg/mL in DMSO and further diluted to 100 μg/mL in PBS.
Peptides were selected from full-length SARS-CoV-2 sequences spanning 82 different strains from 13 countries (National Center for Biotechnology Information). The predicted binding affinities of conserved 9-mer peptides for HLA-A ∗ 0201 and HLA-B ∗ 0702 were determined using NetMHCpan version 4.1 ( Reynisson et al., 2020 35. Reynisson, B. ∙ Alvarez, B. ∙ Paul, S. ... NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.0: improved predictions of MHC antigen presentation by concurrent motif deconvolution and integration of MS MHC eluted ligand data Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :W449-W454 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binders were defined by a threshold IC 50 value of 500 nM. Strong binders were defined by a % Rank < 0.5, and weak binders were defined by a % Rank < 2 ( Table S2 ). A total of 13 strong binders were identified for tetramer generation ( Table S2 ).
HLA class I tetramers were generated as described previously ( Price et al., 2005 34. Price, D.A. ∙ Brenchley, J.M. ∙ Ruff, L.E. ... Avidity for antigen shapes clonal dominance in CD8 + T cell populations specific for persistent DNA viruses J Exp Med. 2005; 202 :1349-1361 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, biotin-tagged HLA-A ∗ 0201 and HLA-B ∗ 0702 heavy chains were expressed under the control of a T7 promoter as insoluble inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). IPTG-induced Escherichia coli were lyzed via repeated freeze/thaw cycles to release inclusion bodies that were subsequently purified by washing in 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Heavy chain and β2 m inclusion body preparations were denatured separately in 8 M urea buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio. Each monomeric protein was refolded in 2-mercaptoethylamine/cystamine redox buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with the appropriate synthetic peptide (Peptides & Elephants GmbH). Refolded monomers were purified via anion exchange after buffer replacement (10 mM Tris, pH 8.1). Purified monomers were biotinylated using d-biotin and BirA (Sigma-Aldrich). Excess biotin was removed via gel filtration. Biotinylated monomers were then tetramerized via the addition of fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin at a 4:1 molar ratio, respectively. The following specificities were used in this study: CMV A ∗ 0201 NV9 (NLVPMVATV), EBV A ∗ 0201 GL9 (GLCTLVAML), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 AV9 (ALSKGVHFV), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 HI9 (HLVDFQVTI), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 KV9 (KLLEQWNLV), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 LL9 (LLLDRLNQL), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 LLY (LLYDANYFL), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 SV9 (SLVKPSFYV), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 TL9 (TLDSKTQSL), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 VL9 (VLNDILSRL), SARS-CoV-2 A ∗ 0201 YL9 (YLQPRTFLL), SARS-CoV-2 B ∗ 0702 FI9 (FPRGQGVPI), SARS-CoV-2 B ∗ 0702 KT9 (KPRQKRTAT), SARS-CoV-2 B ∗ 0702 SA9 (SPRRARSVA), and SARS-CoV-2 B ∗ 0702 SL9 (SPRWYFYYL).
PBMCs were resuspended in complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 1 × 10 7 cells/mL and cultured at 1 × 10 6 cells/well in 96-well V-bottom plates (Corning) with the relevant peptides (each at 0.5 μg/mL) for 30 min prior to the addition of anti-CD28/CD49d (3 μL/mL; clone L293/L25; BD Biosciences), brefeldin A (1 μL/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), monensin (0.7 μL/mL; BD Biosciences), and anti-CD107a–PE-CF594 (clone H4A3; BD Biosciences). Negative control wells lacked peptides, and positive control wells included staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB; 0.5 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) or plate-bound anti-CD3 (1 μg/mL; clone OKT3; BioLegend). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after incubation for 8 hr at 37°C.
PBMCs were labeled with CTV (0.5 μM; Thermo Fisher Scientific), resuspended in complete medium at 1 × 10 7 cells/mL, and cultured at 1 × 10 6 cells/well in 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning) with the relevant peptides (each at 1 μg/mL) in the presence of anti-CD28/CD49d (3 μL/mL; clone L293/L25; BD Biosciences) and IL-2 (10 IU/mL; PeproTech). Negative control wells lacked peptides, and positive control wells included SEB (0.5 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) or plate-bound anti-CD3 (1 μg/mL; clone OKT3; BioLegend). Functional assays were performed as described above after incubation for 5 days at 37°C.
PBMCs were resuspended in complete medium at 1 × 10 7 cells/mL and cultured at 1 × 10 6 cells/well in 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning) with the relevant peptides (each at 1 μg/mL) in the presence of anti-CD28/CD49d (3 μL/mL; clone L293/L25; BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after incubation for 24 hr at 37°C. The following directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies were used to detect activation markers: anti-CD69–BUV737 (clone FN50; BD Biosciences) and anti-4-1BB–BV421 (clone 4B41; BioLegend).
Absolute counts were obtained using Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent with Trucount tubes (BD Biosciences). Samples were fixed with 2% PFA for 2 hr prior to acquisition. Absolute CD3 + cell counts were calculated using the following formula: (# CD3 + events acquired x total # beads x 1000) / (# beads acquired x volume of whole blood stained in μL). CD4 + and CD8 + cell counts were computed from the respective frequencies relative to CD3 + cells.
Analyses were performed using scikit-learn version 0.22.1 in Python. Data were normalized using sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler in the same package to generate z-scores for PCA.
FCS 3.0 data files were imported into FlowJo software version 10.6.0 (FlowJo LLC). All samples were compensated electronically. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the FlowJo plugin UMAP version 2.2 (FlowJo LLC). The downsample version 3.0.0 plugin and concatenation tool was used to visualize multiparametric data from up to a total of 120,000 CD8 + T cells (n = 3 donors per group). Representative donors were selected from the 50 th percentile for all markers. The following parameters were used in these analyses: metric = euclidean, nearest neighbors = 30, and minimum distance = 0.5. Clusters of phenotypically related cells were detected using PhenoGraph version 0.2.1. The following markers were included in the cluster analysis: CCR7, CD27, CD28, CD38, CD39, CD45RA, CD95, CD127, CTLA-4, CXCR5, granzyme B, Ki-67, LAG-3, PD-1, perforin, TCF1, TIGIT, TIM-3, TOX, and 2B4. Plots were generated using Prism version 8.2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.).
PBMCs were rested overnight in complete medium and seeded at 2 × 10 5 cells/well in MultiScreen HTS Filter Plates (Merck Millipore) pre-coated with anti-IFN-γ (15 μg/mL; clone 1-D1K; Mabtech). Test wells were supplemented with overlapping peptides spanning Prot_S, Prot_M, and Prot_N (each at 2 μg/mL; Miltenyi Biotec) or peptides corresponding to known optimal epitopes derived from CMV (pp65) or EBV (BZLF1 and EBNA-1) (each at 2 μg/mL; Peptides & Elephants GmbH). Negative control wells lacked peptides, and positive control wells included SEB (0.5 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). Assays were incubated for 24 hr at 37°C. Plates were then washed six times with PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature with biotinylated anti-IFN-γ (1 μg/mL; clone mAb-7B6-1; Mabtech). After six further washes, a 1:1,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Mabtech) was added for 1 hr at room temperature. Plates were then washed a further six times and developed for 20 min with BCIP/NBT Substrate (Mabtech). All assays were performed in duplicate. Mean values from duplicate wells were used for data representation. Spots were counted using an automated ELISpot Reader System (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH).
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in serum using both the iFLASH Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins (Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co. Ltd.) as well as the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 IgG fully automated indirect chemiluminescent immunoassay against the S1 and S2 (spike) proteins (DiaSorin). These assays produced highly concordant results and have been shown to perform adequately as diagnostic tools ( Plebani et al., 2020 32. Plebani, M. ∙ Padoan, A. ∙ Negrini, D. ... Diagnostic performances and thresholds: The key to harmonization in serological SARS-CoV-2 assays? Clin. Chim. Acta. 2020; 509 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). An individual was considered seropositive if one of the two methods generated a positive result. All assays were performed by trained employees at the clinical laboratory according to standard procedures.
Statistical analyses were performed using R studio or Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Differences between unmatched groups were compared using an unpaired t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, or the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test with Dunn’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons, and differences between matched groups were compared using a paired t test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlations were assessed using the Spearman rank correlation. Non-parametric tests were used if the data were not distributed normally according to the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Phenotypic relationships within multivariate datasets were visualized using FlowJo software version 10.6.1 (FlowJo LLC).
