Title: Control of mammalian locomotion by ventral spinocerebellar tract neurons


Abstract: Summary

Locomotion is a complex behavior required for animal survival. Vertebrate locomotion depends on spinal interneurons termed the central pattern generator (CPG), which generates activity responsible for the alternation of flexor and extensor muscles and the left and right side of the body. It is unknown whether multiple or a single neuronal type is responsible for the control of mammalian locomotion. Here, we show that ventral spinocerebellar tract neurons (VSCTs) drive generation and maintenance of locomotor behavior in neonatal and adult mice. Using mouse genetics, physiological, anatomical, and behavioral assays, we demonstrate that VSCTs exhibit rhythmogenic properties and neuronal circuit connectivity consistent with their essential role in the locomotor CPG. Importantly, optogenetic activation and chemogenetic silencing reveals that VSCTs are necessary and sufficient for locomotion. These findings identify VSCTs as critical components for mammalian locomotion and provide a paradigm shift in our understanding of neural control of complex behaviors.

Section: Introduction

Locomotion is an essential animal behavior that is critical for survival. Overground locomotion is defined as the alternating, rhythmic motor activity between opposing limbs, as well as between antagonistic muscles of the same limb. Although sensory feedback and supraspinal commands are important for modulating locomotion, a network of spinal interneurons—known as the central pattern generator (CPG)—is thought to be responsible for the genesis of locomotor activity ( Guertin, 2012 35. Guertin, P.A. Central pattern generator for locomotion: anatomical, physiological, and pathophysiological considerations Front. Neurol. 2012; 3 :183 PubMed Google Scholar ; Kiehn, 2016 45. Kiehn, O. Decoding the organization of spinal circuits that control locomotion Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :224-238 Crossref Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ) without relying on sensory or descending inputs ( Graham Brown, 1911 32. Graham Brown, T. The intrinsic factors in the act of progression in the mammal Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1911; 84 :308-319 Crossref Google Scholar ). These neurons are thought to activate spinal motor neurons (MNs) in a patterned manner. Subsequently, MNs convey their motor commands to peripheral muscles, resulting in limb movement. Recent studies have begun to unravel the organization of the spinal neuronal circuits underlying left-right and flexor-extensor alternation ( Crone et al., 2008 19. Crone, S.A. ∙ Quinlan, K.A. ∙ Zagoraiou, L. ...

V1 and v2b interneurons secure the alternating flexor-extensor motor activity mice require for limbed locomotion Neuron. 2014; 82 :138-150 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ), demonstrating the modularity and speed-dependency of these circuits. However, it is unknown whether a single neuronal population is necessary and sufficient for the generation and maintenance of locomotor activity. Here, using mice as an experimental model, we identify ventral spinocerebellar tract neurons (VSCTs) as an essential population of spinal neurons for mammalian locomotion.
In rodents, locomotor behavior is evident at early postnatal periods, since intact ex vivo spinal cord preparations can produce locomotor-like behavior following sensory fiber stimulation or application of a cocktail of drugs ( Mentis et al., 2005 57. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Alvarez, F.J. ∙ Bonnot, A. ... Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Talpalar et al., 2013 83. Talpalar, A.E. ∙ Bouvier, J. ∙ Borgius, L. ...

Neurophysiol. 2000; 84 :2821-2833 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). This behavior is characterized by alternating rhythmic oscillations of MN activity between the left and right sides of the spinal cord and between rostral (L1/L2) and caudal (L4/L5) lumbar segments ( Bonnot et al., 2002 10. Bonnot, A. ∙ Whelan, P.J. ∙ Mentis, G.Z. ... Locomotor-like activity generated by the neonatal mouse spinal cord Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 40 :141-151 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Traditionally, CPG networks are thought to reside upstream of MNs ( Goulding and Pfaff, 2005 31. Goulding, M. ∙ Pfaff, S.L. Development of circuits that generate simple rhythmic behaviors in vertebrates Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15 :14-20 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kiehn and Butt, 2003 46.

Neurobiol. 2003; 70 :347-361 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas MNs act as the spinal output to convey motor commands to muscles. However, we have previously shown that stimulation of MN axons results in locomotor activity ( Mentis et al., 2005 57. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Alvarez, F.J. ∙ Bonnot, A. ... Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, manipulation of MN activity can alter ongoing locomotor behavior ( Falgairolle et al., 2017 25. Falgairolle, M. ∙ Puhl, J.G. ∙ Pujala, A. ... Motoneurons regulate the central pattern generator during drug-induced locomotor-like activity in the neonatal mouse eLife. 2017; 6 :e26622 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) and zebrafish MNs can influence premotor excitatory CPG elements ( Song et al., 2016 82. Song, J. ∙ Ampatzis, K. ∙ Björnfors, E.R. ... Motor neurons control locomotor circuit function retrogradely via gap junctions Nature. 2016; 529 :399-402 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations implicate MNs in the regulation of locomotor rhythmogenesis via a local spinal neuron that is activated by MN axon collaterals. Although previous studies have provided evidence that the neural circuits encompassing CPG elements reside in the ventral spinal cord ( Grillner and Wallén, 1985 34. Grillner, S. ∙ Wallén, P.

Decoding the organization of spinal circuits that control locomotion Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :224-238 Crossref Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ), the only spinal neurons that are contacted by MN axon collaterals known to date are Renshaw cells ( Alvarez and Fyffe, 2007 3.

However, Renshaw cells do not affect the locomotor CPG ( Enjin et al., 2017 24. Enjin, A. ∙ Perry, S. ∙ Hilscher, M.M. ...

Brain Res. 1987; 66 :99-105 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Sim1 + neurons regulate the speed of vertebrate locomotion and contribute to vigor and coordination but are not involved in locomotor rhythmogenesis ( Zhang et al., 2008 92. Zhang, Y. ∙ Narayan, S. ∙ Geiman, E. ... V3 spinal neurons establish a robust and balanced locomotor rhythm during walking Neuron. 2008; 60 :84-96 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, MNs may contact another yet-to-be-defined neuron that resides within the ventral spinal cord and mediates locomotor rhythmogenesis.
Here, we show that VSCTs are contacted by MN axon collaterals during early development via both chemical and electrical synapses. The nature of these contacts is both chemical via excitatory synapses, as well as electrical through gap junctions. Furthermore, VSCTs possess functional intrinsic properties consistent with a role in locomotor rhythmogenesis. We demonstrate that VSCTs contain axon collaterals that form local circuits with spinal MNs and at least Chx10 + spinal neurons. Importantly, optogenetic activation and chemogenetic silencing of VSCTs reveals that VSCT neurons are both necessary and sufficient to produce locomotor behavior during postnatal development. Finally, chemogenetic silencing of VSCTs in freely moving adult mice perturbs their locomotor ability.

Section: Results

To investigate whether spinal MNs activate a yet-unknown interneuron, we unbiasedly examined the activity of spinal neurons through two-photon (2P) calcium imaging in the intact ex vivo mouse spinal cord at postnatal day 4 (P4). Spinal neurons were indiscriminately labeled with calcium green 1 by electroporation ( Figures S1 A and S1B; STAR Methods). Stimulation of the ventral root (VR) revealed increases in fluorescence in interneurons located dorsolateral to the MN nucleus ( Figures S1 C and S1D). Visually guided, whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings revealed that these neurons displayed graded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with a short latency following VR stimulation ( Figure S1 E), indicating that can be activated directly by MN axon collaterals. These neurons, located in the dorsal aspect of the MN nucleus were reminiscent of spinal border cells—a subset of VSCTs ( Bras et al., 1988 12. Bras, H. ∙ Cavallari, P. ∙ Jankowska, E. Demonstration of initial axon collaterals of cells of origin of the ventral spinocerebellar tract in the cat J. Comp. Neurol. 1988; 273 :584-592 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cooper and Sherrington, 1940 18. Cooper, S. ∙ Sherrington, C.S. Gowers tract and spinal border cells Brain. 1940; 63 :123-134 Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar ). To determine whether these neurons were VSCTs, the tracer cholera toxin subunit b conjugated to Alexa-555 (CTb-555) was injected into the cerebellum in mice at P0 ( Figure 1 A). At P4, the injection was verified to be specific to the cerebellum ( Figure S1 F), as shown by CTb signal only in the cerebellum ( Figure S1 G). Individual VSCTs located in the L1/L2 spinal segments were then visually targeted for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings guided by 2P laser microscopy ( Figures 1 B and 1C) utilizing the ex vivo cerebellum-brainstem-spinal cord preparation. Only a single VSCT was recorded per spinal cord, targeted from the lateral aspect. In addition to co-localization of CTb-555 with the intracellular dye ( Figure 1 C), the identity of VSCTs was further demonstrated by the presence of an all-or-none antidromic action potential (AP) following cerebellum stimulation ( Figures 1 D–1F). VSCTs exhibited higher excitability compared with MNs ( Fletcher et al., 2017 27. Fletcher, E.V. ∙ Simon, C.M. ∙ Pagiazitis, J.G. ... Reduced sensory synaptic excitation impairs motor neuron function via Kv2.1 in spinal muscular atrophy Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :905-916 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 G–1K) despite having a soma size similar to MNs ( Fletcher et al., 2017 27. Fletcher, E.V. ∙ Simon, C.M. ∙ Pagiazitis, J.G. ... Reduced sensory synaptic excitation impairs motor neuron function via Kv2.1 in spinal muscular atrophy Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :905-916 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 L).
Next, we sought to identify the major source of synaptic activation of VSCTs. A major source of afferents originates from the periphery and sensory fiber stimulation can activate locomotor networks ( Whelan et al., 2000 88. Whelan, P. ∙ Bonnot, A. ∙ O'Donovan, M.J. Properties of rhythmic activity generated by the isolated spinal cord of the neonatal mouse J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84 :2821-2833 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we tested whether dorsal root (DR) stimulation, including proprioceptors, could activate VSCTs. Stimulation of the homosegmental DR revealed monosynaptically evoked EPSPs in 40% of VSCTs (6/15) at P3–P5 ( Figure 2 A). Monosynapticity was determined by the absence of a change in the coefficient of variation (CV) of the latency of the response onset at different stimulation frequencies (0.1–10 Hz) as we reported ( Mendelsohn et al., 2015 56. Mendelsohn, A.I. ∙ Simon, C.M. ∙ Abbott, L.F. ... Activity regulates the incidence of heteronymous sensory-motor connections Neuron. 2015; 87 :111-123 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 B and 2C). Staining with Parvalbumin (Pv) and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) antibodies confirmed apposition of proprioceptive synapses on VSCTs ( Figure 2 I). To quantify the number of VSCTs receiving proprioceptive synapses, VSCTs were labeled with CTb-555 from cerebellum injection at birth. At P4/P5, DR L1 sensory fibers using the ex vivo spinal cord preparation were labeled orthogradely with Cascade Blue Dextran and subsequently marked with VGluT1 and Pv. The presence of VGluT1, Pv, and Dextran has been demonstrated to label selectively proprioceptive synapses ( Chen et al., 2006 16. Chen, A.I. ∙ de Nooij, J.C. ∙ Jessell, T.M. Graded activity of transcription factor Runx3 specifies the laminar termination pattern of sensory axons in the developing spinal cord Neuron. 2006; 49 :395-408 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mentis et al., 2006 60. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Siembab, V.C. ∙ Zerda, R. ... Primary afferent synapses on developing and adult Renshaw cells J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :13297-13310 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar , 2011 58. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Blivis, D. ∙ Liu, W. ... Early functional impairment of sensory-motor connectivity in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy Neuron. 2011; 69 :453-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that 8 VSCTs (∼47%, 8/17, N = 6 mice) receive proprioceptive synapses on their soma or proximal dendrites ( Figures S1 H–S1J), whereas 9 VSCTs (∼53%, 9/17, N = 6 mice) did not. These results are in agreement with our physiological studies and demonstrate that ∼45% of VSCTs receive proprioceptive synapses.
Next, we examined whether VSCTs could be activated directly by MN axon collaterals. Utilizing the ex vivo spinal cord preparation (P3–P5), intracellular recordings of VSCTs ( Figure 1 C) exhibited short latency, depolarizing, and graded EPSPs sufficient to induce APs following VR stimulation ( Figure 2 D). All VSCTs (n = 10) were activated monosynaptically since different frequencies of VR stimulation (0.1–10 Hz) resulted in no change in the CV of the latency of the onset of EPSPs ( Figures 2 E and 2F). These EPSPs decreased at more depolarized holding potentials indicating the involvement of chemical synapses ( Figures S1 K and S1L). Through the addition of mecamylamine (cholinergic receptor blocker) and 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX) (glutamatergic receptor blocker), we determined that MNs activate VSCTs directly via both cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Surprisingly, a residual component was evident following both cholinergic and glutamatergic blockade in VSCTs, which was blocked after exposure to carbenoxolone (gap junction blocker), indicating that MNs and VSCTs are also electrically coupled ( Figures 2 G and 2H). To evaluate the spread of current from the entire population of spinocerebellar tract neurons (SCTs) to a population of MNs located within one spinal segment, we utilized the cerebellum-brainstem-spinal cord ex vivo preparation at P4 and P5 ( Figures S2 A–S2C). Maximal cerebellum activation resulted in robust VR responses with a latency of ∼40 ms ( Figure S2 C), consistent with the latency of the antidromic AP of VSCTs from the cerebellum ( Figure 1 E). Comparison of the VR response following cerebellar stimulation with that from the homonymous DR ( Figures S2 B and S2C) revealed that cerebellar stimulation resulted in ∼35% of the MN activation compared with DR stimulation ( Figures S2 D and S2E). This indicates robust activation of MNs by axon collaterals from SCTs. The VR response was monosynaptic in nature since stimulation at different frequencies resulted in an identical latency, indicative of monosynapticity ( Figure S2 F). By measuring the VR response following cerebellum stimulation under carbenoxolone exposure (100 μM) we found a significant, yet modest, ∼15% reduction of the VR response ( Figures S2 G and S2H). Further exposure to NBQX (20 μM) and amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) (100 μM) (non-NMDA and NMDA glutamate receptor blockers, respectively) abolished the VR response ( Figures S2 G and S2H). These results indicate that the spread of current through gaps junctions from SCTs to MNs is minimal and the chemical nature of communication between VSCTs and MNs is dominant.
The nature of MN-to-VSCT synaptic transmission was further investigated by morphological analysis in which MN axon collaterals were found to form cholinergic synapses on VSCTs ( Figures 2 J–2L). The electrical communication between VSCTs and MNs was also established morphologically. During intracellular recordings, Neurobiotin (in intracellular electrode) was allowed to diffuse into the recorded neuron as to reveal its somato-dendritic morphology and axonal trajectory. However, Neurobiotin is also a tracer known to cross gap junctions ( Pastor et al., 2003 66. Pastor, A.M. ∙ Mentis, G.Z. ∙ De La Cruz, R.R. ... Increased electrotonic coupling in spinal motoneurons after transient botulinum neurotoxin paralysis in the neonatal rat J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89 :793-805 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) and identify dye-coupled partners of the recorded neuron. In this manner, we observed Neurobiotin-labeled MNs following a single VSCT fill ( Figures S2 I and S2J), and dye coupling was also observed among VSCTs ( Figure S2 K). Seven VSCTs (∼60%, 7/12) were dye coupled, three of which exhibited dye coupling only among other VSCTs, whereas three more VSCTs exhibited dye coupling with both other VSCTs and MNs. One VSCT was dye coupled only with MNs. Despite dye coupling underestimates the extent of electrical coupling due to limitations in the time and diffusion rate of the tracer, our results indicate a substantial degree of electrical coupling (>60%) for VSCTs.
Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that MNs activate VSCTs via both chemical and electrical synapses. They also reveal the electrical communication among VSCTs themselves.
Lundberg postulated that VSCTs relay information about the activity of spinal networks to the cerebellum ( Lundberg, 1971 49. Lundberg, A. Function of the ventral spinocerebellar tract A new hypothesis. Exp. Brain Res. 1971; 12 :317-330 PubMed Google Scholar ). This hypothesis gained traction from experiments in adult cats demonstrating that the activity of VSCTs is rhythmically modulated during locomotion after deafferentation ( Arshavsky et al., 1972 4. Arshavsky, Y.I. ∙ Berkinblit, M.B. ∙ Fukson, O.I. ... Origin of modulation in neurones of the ventral spinocerebellar tract during locomotion Brain Res. 1972; 43 :276-279 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether VSCTs are rhythmically active during locomotor behavior, we induced locomotor-like activity utilizing the intact ex vivo mouse spinal cord (from T4 to cauda equina ) as previously reported ( Bonnot et al., 2002 10. Bonnot, A. ∙ Whelan, P.J. ∙ Mentis, G.Z. ... Locomotor-like activity generated by the neonatal mouse spinal cord Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 40 :141-151 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiang et al., 1999 41. Jiang, Z. ∙ Carlin, K.P. ∙ Brownstone, R.M. An in vitro functionally mature mouse spinal cord preparation for the study of spinal motor networks Brain Res. 1999; 816 :493-499 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stimulation of lumbar VRs or DRs ( Mentis et al., 2005 57. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Alvarez, F.J. ∙ Bonnot, A. ... Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) while recording intracellularly from individual VSCTs (located in the L1/L2 segments) concomitantly with the left and right L1 VRs and the right (or left) L5 VR. VSCTs (n = 6) displayed robust rhythmic behavior and bouts of APs ( Figure 3 A) in phase with the ipsilateral, homosegmental L1 VR (containing predominately flexor MNs). Two more VSCTs exhibited sub-threshold rhythmic oscillations during sensory-induced locomotor behavior (n = 2; Figure S3 A).
Calculation of the timing of the onset of VSCT firing compared with the onset of the flexor burst, normalized to the locomotor cycle length, revealed the relationship between the initiation of VSCT firing and that of MN firing in the same spinal segment for each locomotor cycle ( Figure 3 B 1 ; STAR Methods). The mean vector value from each of the individual VSCTs, plotted in a circular plot corresponding to the locomotor cycle ( Figure 3 B 2 ), determined if the combined population of VSCTs exhibited rhythmic activity. On average, we found that VSCTs elicited their first AP preceding the onset of the cycle from the homosegmental VR ( Figures 3 B 1 , 3B 2 , and S3 B; STAR Methods). Thus, VSCTs fire rhythmically with flexor MNs and elicit APs prior to the locomotor cycle exhibited by homosegmental MNs.
We observed that VSCTs exhibited a pacemaker current, a rhythmogenic property characterized by a slow, steady depolarization until the threshold voltage for AP induction is reached both spontaneously ( Figure 3 C) and evoked ( Figure 3 D). The H-current (I h ) is caused by the opening of a non-selective cation channel with an equilibrium potential of −35 mV and is known to underlie pacemaker currents in neurons ( Lüthi and McCormick, 1998 50. Lüthi, A. ∙ McCormick, D.A. H-current: properties of a neuronal and network pacemaker Neuron. 1998; 21 :9-12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). VSCTs displayed the characteristic voltage sag and post-inhibitory rebound in response to a negative current injection, indicative of the presence of I h ( Figure 3 E). The sag and post-inhibitory rebound were both time dependent and voltage dependent ( Figures S3 C and S3D). The post-inhibitory rebound was large enough to cause VSCTs to fire an AP from their own resting membrane potential ( Figures 3 E, S3 C, and S3D). Both sag and post-inhibitory rebound were abolished by bath application of ZD7288—a selective blocker of I h ( Rothberg et al., 2002 75. Rothberg, B.S. ∙ Shin, K.S. ∙ Phale, P.S. ... Voltage-controlled gating at the intracellular entrance to a hyperpolarization-activated cation channel J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119 :83-91 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar )—and recovered upon washout ( Figures 3 E–3G). ZD7288 decreased the resting membrane potential of VSCTs, increased their excitability, and did not affect the threshold voltage for AP induction ( Figures S3 E–S3J) as expected ( Kase and Imoto, 2012 43. Kase, D. ∙ Imoto, K. The role of HCN channels on membrane excitability in the nervous system J. Signal Transduct. 2012; 2012 :619747 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Lüthi and McCormick, 1998 50. Lüthi, A. ∙ McCormick, D.A. H-current: properties of a neuronal and network pacemaker Neuron. 1998; 21 :9-12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, the electrical coupling between VSCTs and the presence of the pacemaker h-current may underlie the contribution of VSCTs to locomotor rhythmogenesis.
To address the functional involvement of VSCTs in locomotor behavior, we used viral-mediated gene delivery to selectively manipulate neuronal activity of SCTs. Cerebellum injection with canine adenovirus 2 (CAV2) expressing GFP demonstrated effective and specific transduction of SCTs ( Figure 4 M). The efficiency of VSCTs transduction by CAV2-GFP-Cre was ∼60% ( Figures 4 N, S4 A, and S4B) when compared with CTb-555 co-injected to cerebellum at P0/P1 and examined at P4/P5. To activate VSCTs, CAV2-GFP-Cre, CAV2-Cre, or CAV2-GFP was injected into the cerebellum of lsl -Channelrhodopsin2 mice at P0. We then used the ex vivo spinal cord preparation (T4- cauda equina ) at P4 and 470 nm light—delivered through a LED—to photoactivate VSCTs bilaterally in the L1/L2 lumbar segments ( Figure 4 A), considered as the most rhythmogenic spinal cord area ( Cazalets et al., 1995 14. Cazalets, J.R. ∙ Borde, M. ∙ Clarac, F. Localization and organization of the central pattern generator for hindlimb locomotion in newborn rat J. Neurosci. 1995; 15 :4943-4951 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 1996 47. Kjaerulff, O. ∙ Kiehn, O. Distribution of networks generating and coordinating locomotor activity in the neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro : a lesion study J. Neurosci. 1996; 16 :5777-5794 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, VSCT photoactivation produced robust locomotor-like behavior in all preparations (N = 8) ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Dorsal spinocerebellar tract neurons’ (DSCTs) illumination from the dorsal aspect in the same preparations (flipped over 180°, Figure 4 D) revealed no effects ( Figures 4 E and 4F). The same preparations (N = 8) were flipped over once more to activate VSCTs, resulting in robust locomotor behavior and indicating that VSCTs, but not DSCTs, were responsible for locomotor behavior. Morphological experiments revealed the presence of ∼1,200 DSCTs ( Figures S4 C and S4D) and ∼850 VSCTs ( Figures S4 C and S4E) in the L1 spinal segment at P4. In control experiments, LED illumination had no effects on VSCTs expressing CAV2-GFP ( Figures S4 F–S4H). Using a distinct approach, ChR2 was introduced to SCTs by a rabies virus (N2C) expressing both ChR2 and YFP as previously reported ( Reardon et al., 2016 71. Reardon, T.R. ∙ Murray, A.J. ∙ Turi, G.F. ... Rabies virus CVS-N2c(ΔG) strain enhances retrograde synaptic transfer and neuronal viability Neuron. 2016; 89 :711-724 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). The virus was injected into the cerebellum in wild-type (WT) mice at P0 and experiments were performed at P4 and P5 using the ex vivo spinal cord to photoactivate VSCTs from the ventral side with a 470 nm LED. This approach also produced robust locomotor-like activity with similar locomotor frequencies ( Figures S5 A–S5C) to those observed when CAV2-Cre injected in lsl -ChR2 mice. Importantly, the frequency of the induced locomotor rhythm following photoactivation of VSCTs was similar to that produced after sensory or MN axon stimulation and faster than that produced via application of a pharmacological cocktail ( Figure 4 O). Together, these results demonstrate that activation of VSCTs is sufficient to elicit locomotor behavior.
Archaerhodopsin-3 (ArchR3) was introduced to VSCTs by injection of CAV2-GFP-Cre (or CAV2-GFP) into the cerebellum of lsl -ArchR3 mice at P0 ( Figure S5 D) to silence VSCTs during sensory-evoked locomotor activity to reveal whether VSCTs are necessary for locomotor behavior. Utilizing the ex vivo spinal cord preparation, we photo-silenced VSCTs through illumination with a 585 nm LED light delivered to the L1/L2 segments ventrally and bilaterally ( Figures S5 E and S5F) at P3–P5, which resulted in severe degradation of locomotor activity ( Figures S5 G and S5H). To increase the number of silenced VSCTs beyond those neurons located in L1/L2 segments, we next used a chemogenetic approach by injecting CAV2-GFP-Cre or CAV2-GFP at P0 into the cerebellum of mice with a floxed inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs; hM4Di) ( Figures 4 M and 4N). Strikingly, bath application of clozapine N-oxide (CNO; 10 μM) to silence SCTs throughout the spinal cord prevented the induction of locomotor-like activity following either sensory stimulation ( Figures 4 G and 4H) or MN axon stimulation ( Figures 4 I and 4J). The effect was reversible because locomotor activity resumed ∼30 min after CNO washout and following stimulation of either sensory fibers in a DR ( Figure 4 G) or MN axons in a VR ( Figure 4 I). Importantly, exposure to CNO did not affect glutamatergic neurotransmission as shown by the unchanged amplitude of the homosegmental monosynaptic DR-to-VR reflex ( Figures S5 I and S5J), indicating that MNs function normally. Exposure to CNO in mice injected with CAV2-GFP had no effect on the locomotor frequency induced by DR or VR stimulation as expected ( Figures S5 K and S5L). Thus, these experiments indicate that VSCTs are necessary for the induction of locomotor activity.
Silencing of SCTs through CNO exposure during ongoing locomotor-like activity induced by a cocktail of drugs (NMDA, serotonin, and dopamine) ( Figures 4 K and 4L), known to produce locomotor behavior in neonates ( Bonnot et al., 2002 10. Bonnot, A. ∙ Whelan, P.J. ∙ Mentis, G.Z. ... Locomotor-like activity generated by the neonatal mouse spinal cord Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 40 :141-151 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mentis et al., 2005 57. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Alvarez, F.J. ∙ Bonnot, A. ... Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ), abolished the activity shortly after CNO exposure, providing evidence that VSCTs are necessary not only for the induction of locomotor behavior but also for its maintenance ( Figures 4 K and 4L). In sum, these experiments demonstrate that VSCTs are necessary and sufficient to induce and maintain locomotor behavior during mouse development.
Since VSCTs exhibit an I h current, we investigated whether I h is necessary to produce locomotor activity following photoactivation of VSCTs. This was compared side-by-side with locomotor activity induced by DR stimulation. VSCTs were transduced with by CAV2-GFP-Cre in lsl -ChR2 mice at P0. We then used a 470 nm light to photoactivate VSCTs bilaterally (from the ventral aspect) in the L1/L2 lumbar segments at P4 using the ex vivo spinal cord preparation. As we have shown before ( Figure 4 B), photoactivation of VSCTs resulted in robust locomotor-like activity ( Figure 5 A).
Bath application of ZD7288 (100 μM) abolished locomotor activity during VSCT photoactivation 20 min after exposure ( Figures 5 A and 5B) but in contrast, reduced the locomotor frequency by ∼50% after sensory-induced locomotor activity ( Figures 5 C and 5D). However, locomotor behavior was abolished with both induction methods ∼40 min after ZD7288 ( Figures 5 A–5D). These results demonstrate that the I h current is a major contributor to the production of locomotor behavior during early development and that the channels responsible for the I h in VSCTs play a prominent role in this behavior.
Since we established that VSCTs are electrically coupled with other VSCTs, as well as MNs, we next investigated the impact of electrical coupling in the production of locomotor behavior. The robust locomotor-like activity evoked at P3–P5 by photoactivation of L1/L2 VSCTs expressing ChR2 (after cerebellum injection with CAV2-GFP-Cre in lsl -ChR2 mice at P0) was abolished after ∼40 min of carbenoxolone exposure (gap junction blocker [ Mentis et al., 2005 57. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Alvarez, F.J. ∙ Bonnot, A. ... Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tresch and Kiehn, 2000 85. Tresch, M.C. ∙ Kiehn, O. Motor coordination without action potentials in the mammalian spinal cord Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3 :593-599 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ]) ( Figures S5 M and S5N). Photoactivation of VSCTs in the L4/L5 segments also elicited robust locomotor activity that was subsequently abolished after addition of carbenoxolone demonstrating that activation of VSCTs in different lumbar segments also produces locomotor-like activity ( Figures 5 E and 5F).
Lastly, we tested the involvement of electrical coupling following electrically induced locomotor activity by stimulation of either MN axons (via VRs) or sensory fibers (via DRs) in the same spinal cord ex vivo preparations in which VSCTs were photo-activated. MN axon stimulation produced robust locomotor activity, whereas exposure to 100 μM carbenoxolone abolished this activity ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Similarly, DR stimulation resulted in locomotor activity of similar frequency to that produced by VR stimulation. Exposure to carbenoxolone abolished the locomotor behavior ( Figures 5 I and 5J). These results demonstrate that both I h and electrical coupling contribute to the production of locomotor behavior following activation of VSCTs.
To determine how VSCTs coordinate the production of locomotor behavior, we examined the circuit connectivity of VSCTs within the spinal cord by focusing on their outputs. We first sought to identify the neurotransmitter utilized by VSCTs marked by CTb-488 from cerebellum, using fluorescence in situ hybridization against the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2). Nearly all VSCTs (∼93%, N = 3) express VGluT2 ( Figures 6 A and 6B), similar to DSCTs (∼91%, N = 3) at P4. This result establishes that VSCTs are excitatory neurons, validating the proposal that SCTs are glutamatergic in nature ( Atkinson et al., 2004 5. Atkinson, L. ∙ Batten, T.F. ∙ Moores, T.S. ... Differential co-localisation of the P2X7 receptor subunit with vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in rat CNS Neuroscience. 2004; 123 :761-768 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ).
VSCTs in the adult cat possess axon collaterals within the spinal cord ( Bras et al., 1988 12. Bras, H. ∙ Cavallari, P. ∙ Jankowska, E. Demonstration of initial axon collaterals of cells of origin of the ventral spinocerebellar tract in the cat J. Comp. Neurol. 1988; 273 :584-592 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used Neurobiotin to reveal the morphology of VSCTs that were intracellularly recorded and subsequently filled and found evidence of spinal axon collaterals in neonatal VSCTs projecting both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the VSCT soma ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 A–S6C). To investigate the presence of axon collaterals in a larger number of VSCTs, we first injected CTb-647 together with CAV2-Cre virus into the cerebellum of newborn mice and then injected AAV9-CBh-DiO-eGFP (Adeno-associate virus [AAV] carrying a flexed reporter) directly into the lumbar spinal segments a few days later (∼P5–P7) to transduce VSCTs and ultimately visualize their axon collaterals ( Figure S6 D). The efficiency of the AAV9-CBh-DiO-eGFP to label VSCTs was relatively low, allowing to reveal the full somato-dendritic and axonal trajectory in individual VSCTs ( Figure S6 E). We used Neurolucida to reconstruct VSCTs that possess axon collaterals ( Figures S6 F–S6H), and the identity of the axon and its collaterals was verified by ankyrin G (AnkG) (axonal marker) immunoreactivity in some VSCTs ( Figures S6 I and S6J). We observed axon collaterals in seven VSCTs (53%, 7/13). In six additional VSCTs, we did not observe axon collaterals along the visible length of the main axon, although they may contain axon collaterals at different spinal segments. Overall, these experiments indicate that ∼55% of VSCTs possess axon collaterals.
To reveal the territory of synapses from axon collaterals of SCTs, we marked synapses from SCT axon collaterals within the L1/L2 lumbar segments, by co-localization of CTb-488 (cerebellum injection at P0), together with Synaptophysin and VGluT2 immunoreactivity at P5 ( Figures S7 A–S7D, N = 4), using single-plane confocal images and ImageJ analysis (see STAR Methods). These synapses were located medially in the intermediate gray matter and within the MN nucleus, whereas very few synapses were found in the lateral aspect of the intermediate gray matter or the dorsal horn ( Figure S7 D).
We also found that VSCTs directly contact ipsilateral and contralateral MNs ( Figures S7 E and S7F), as well as spinal interneurons, since VSCT axon collaterals were observed in the intermediate gray matter. To uncover the identity of the spinal interneurons contacted by VSCT axon collaterals, we investigated whether VSCTs synapse with Chx10 + spinal neurons. We used a rabies (N2c) virus engineered to cross a single synapse in a retrograde fashion to identify neurons monosynaptically connected to a “starter” population ( Reardon et al., 2016 71. Reardon, T.R. ∙ Murray, A.J. ∙ Turi, G.F. ... Rabies virus CVS-N2c(ΔG) strain enhances retrograde synaptic transfer and neuronal viability Neuron. 2016; 89 :711-724 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), in this case Chx10 + neurons. We injected Cre-conditional AAVs into the spinal cord of Chx10-Cre mice to restrict rabies glycoprotein (G) and TVA to Chx10 + neurons ( Figures 6 E and 6F). Concurrently, we injected CTb-647 into the cerebellum to -label VSCTs. After ∼10 days, we injected Rabies-N2c-EnvA-dsRed into the spinal lumbar segments. This virus, directly infects only Chx10 + neurons and presynaptic neurons. Accordingly, the Chx10 + “starter” population was labeled with a nuclear GFP (nGFP) and dsRed in the cytoplasm, whereas cells providing monosynaptic input to the starter population were labeled with dsRed only. Morphological analysis revealed one or more VSCTs (CTb + and ventral horn location) that were monosynaptically connected to Chx10 + neurons ( Figures 6 G and 6H). These experiments indicated that VSCTs target Chx10 + spinal neurons, as well as MNs. Importantly, they also showed morphological evidence of VSCT axon collaterals forming synapses with the soma and dendrites of Chx10 + neurons in adult mice ( Figure 6 G, arrows).
Next, we investigated the extent of the VSCT axon collaterals’ projection within the spinal cord by injecting two different CTb fluorescent tracers into the cerebellum and the L5/L6 caudal lumbar spinal cord segments at birth ( Figure S7 G). At ∼P5, we examined the L1/L2 segments for VSCTs that expressed both fluorescent tracers. We found that ∼34% of the L1/L2 VSCTs were double labeled ( Figures S7 H and S7I), demonstrating that VSCTs send descending axon collaterals to caudal spinal segments in addition to their main ascending axon to the cerebellum. Thus, VSCTs form local and extra-segmental spinal circuits with MNs, Chx10 + neurons and likely with other spinal neurons via their axon collaterals.
To investigate whether SCTs are essential for mammalian locomotor behavior in adult mice, we chemogenetically silenced SCTs in freely moving adult (P35–P45) mice. We first investigated whether there are any direct connections from the cerebellum to the spinal cord in mice as previously postulated in cats ( Matsushita and Hosoya, 1978 53. Matsushita, M. ∙ Hosoya, Y. The location of spinal projection neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (cerebellospinal tract neurons) of the cat. A study with the horseradish peroxidase technique Brain Res. 1978; 142 :237-248 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), rats ( Bentivoglio and Kuypers, 1982 7. Bentivoglio, M. ∙ Kuypers, H.G. Divergent axon collaterals from rat cerebellar nuclei to diencephalon, mesencephalon, medulla oblongata and cervical cord. A fluorescent double retrograde labeling study Exp. Brain Res. 1982; 46 :339-356 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), and mice ( Sathyamurthy et al., 2020 76. Sathyamurthy, A. ∙ Barik, A. ∙ Dobrott, C.I. ... Cerebellospinal neurons regulate motor performance and motor learning Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107595 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) by injecting CTb-555 in the L2/L3 spinal cord in vivo at P0 or P21 and examined the cerebellum at P4 and P35, respectively. We found no evidence of CTb-555 labeled neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei either at P4 ( Figures S8 A–S8E) or at P35 ( Figures S8 F–S8J), indicating the lack of direct connections from the cerebellum to the lumbar spinal cord at these ages. To further exclude any potential effects of cerebello-spinal connections that might have been missed by CTb retrograde labeling, we used Cdx2 FlpO mice crossed with fsf-lsl- h4MDi mice to generate Cdx2 FlpO :: fsf-lsl- h4MDi mice. In this way, we excluded not only any potential direct connections between cerebellum and spinal cord but also any effects of brain neurons possibly transduced from the cerebellum injections, thus limiting the expression of h4MDi to SCTs only, as Cdx2 is solely expressed in spinal cord ( Abraira et al., 2017 1. Abraira, V.E. ∙ Kuehn, E.D. ∙ Chirila, A.M. ... The cellular and synaptic architecture of the mechanosensory dorsal horn Cell. 2017; 168 :295-310.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ).
CAV2-GFP-Cre or CAV2-GFP or CTb-647 (for counting neurons) was injected into the cerebellum of Cdx2 FlpO :: fsf-lsl -h4MDi mice at P21 ( Figure 7 A) and experiments performed at P35–P45, resulting in ∼750 CTb-647 + VSCTs in the L1 segment ( Figures 7 B and 7C; STAR Methods). We then counted the number of VSCTs in the L1 segment expressing GFP and found that ∼400 VSCTs were transduced with CAV2-GFP-Cre ( Figures 7 D 1 –7D 3 and 7E), which corresponds to a ∼53% transduction efficiency comparable with that in neonates ( Figure 4 N). Expression of DREADDs within VSCTs was confirmed by immunoreactivity against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag co-localizing with CTb-647-labeled spinal neurons from the injected cerebellum ( Figure S9 A). Importantly, no HA immunoreactivity was observed in the cerebellum ( Figure S9 B), hippocampus ( Figure S9 C), cortex ( Figure S9 D), and brainstem ( Figure S9 E). In addition, selective Cdx2 expression throughout the spinal cord was confirmed by detecting mCherry fluorescence ( Figure S9 F). GFP + SCTs were found in the cervical ( Figure S9 G), thoracic ( Figure S9 H), and caudal lumbar ( Figure S9 I) spinal segments. Thus, only SCTs expressed the inhibitory DREADD receptors, ruling out any contributions from the brain during exposure to CNO.
Mice injected at P21 with CAV2-GFP-Cre (or CAV2-GFP) were injected with CNO (5 mg/kg, i.p.) at P35–P45 to silence SCTs. To assess quantitatively the locomotor ability of freely moving mice, we utilized the open field assay and measured the distance traveled for 10 min every hour for a total of 6 h. At the onset of the experiment (first 10 min following CNO injection) there was no statistical difference between CAV2-GFP-Cre and CAV2-GFP groups ( Figures 7 F 1 and 7G). Mice in the CAV2-GFP-Cre group revealed a progressive reduction in the distance traveled at 1 h post CNO injection compared with the controls ( Figure 7 G). Strikingly, the majority of mice in the CAV2-GFP-Cre group stopped moving between 2 and 3 h post CNO injection ( Figures 7 F 2 , 7G, S9 J, and S9K). As expected, the effects of CNO declined 4 h after CNO injection, and CAV2-GFP-Cre mice started moving around again ( Figures 7 G, S9 J, and S9K).
To investigate further the locomotor ability of adult mice in which SCTs were “silenced,” we used a swim test as a proxy for the locomotor CPG. Adult mice (∼P35–P45) in which SCTs were chemically “silenced” by exposure to CNO were tested during free swimming. Cdx2 FlpO :: fsf - lsl -h4MDi injected with either CAV2-GFP or CAV2-Cre were examined just prior to 10 mg/kg (equivalent dose to ex vivo experiments) CNO injection and 3 h after CNO injection, which we determined to be the optimal time point for the effect of CNO. High-speed videography was used in mice freely swimming for 30 s. We found that there was no statistical difference in the ability and total swim period between the two groups before CNO administration ( Figure 7 H). In striking contrast, mice that received CAV2-Cre cerebellum injections exhibited a strong reduction in their ability to swim 3 h after CNO administration ( Videos S1 A [pre-CNO], S1 B [3 h CNO] for mouse A, S2 A [pre-CNO], and S2B [3 h CNO] for mouse B). These mice exhibited a “floating” behavior during which their overall inability to swim was interspersed with short periods of swimming ( Figure 7 H; Videos S1 and S2 ). Control mice were able to swim for the entire testing period after 3 h from CNO administration ( Figure 7 H; Videos S3 A [Pre-CNO] and S3 B [3 h CNO] for mouse C), indicating that CNO itself did not have any effects on swimming behavior. The total period that mice were able to swim was significantly reduced in mice injected with CAV2-Cre ( Figure 7 H). Quantification of the maximum hindlimb stroke frequency revealed that mice in the CAV2-Cre group displayed significantly lower maximum frequency compared with controls during the short periods in which they were able to swim ( Figure 7 I). Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that mice with “silenced” SCTs have significantly compromised ability to produce locomotor activity during both early postnatal development and in adulthood, pointing to VSCTs as essential drivers of mammalian locomotion.

Section: Discussion

Our discovery that VSCTs are core components of the CPG that are both necessary and sufficient for locomotor behavior represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the mechanisms of locomotion. Instead of a distributed network responsible for locomotion, the neural control of locomotion may use VSCTs as a nodal point. Sensory inputs and descending supraspinal pathways ( Baldissera and Roberts, 1975 6. Baldissera, F. ∙ Roberts, W.J.

Physiol. 2012; 590 :1737-1755 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as MN input ( Falgairolle et al., 2017 25. Falgairolle, M. ∙ Puhl, J.G. ∙ Pujala, A. ...

USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ), are all known pathways that initiate or regulate locomotion and converge on VSCTs. Our findings identify an unexpected function for VSCTs as key controllers of mammalian locomotion and demonstrate that a single neuronal type is essential for such behavior, fundamentally changing the way we think complex behaviors are produced.
Although the initiation of vertebrate locomotion takes place in the brain ( Garcia-Rill, 1986 28. Garcia-Rill, E. The basal ganglia and the locomotor regions Brain Res. 1986; 396 :47-63 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jordan et al., 2008 42. Jordan, L.M. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Hedlund, P.B. ... Descending command systems for the initiation of locomotion in mammals Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 57 :183-191 Crossref Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ), and neurons in the brainstem can halt locomotion ( Bouvier et al., 2015 11. Bouvier, J. ∙ Caggiano, V. ∙ Leiras, R. ... Descending command neurons in the brainstem that halt locomotion Cell. 2015; 163 :1191-1203 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), the rhythm and pattern generation is solely produced by spinal neurons known as the locomotor CPG ( Grillner, 2003 33. Grillner, S. The motor infrastructure: from ion channels to neuronal networks Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4 :573-586 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kiehn, 2006 44. Kiehn, O. Locomotor circuits in the mammalian spinal cord Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29 :279-306 Crossref Scopus (678) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several types of excitatory interneurons originating from some progenitor domains (V0, V2, and V3) have been proposed as putative rhythm generators ( Gosgnach et al., 2017 29. Gosgnach, S. ∙ Bikoff, J.B. ∙ Dougherty, K.J. ... Delineating the diversity of spinal interneurons in locomotor circuits J. Neurosci. 2017; 37 :10835-10841 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kiehn, 2016 45. Kiehn, O. Decoding the organization of spinal circuits that control locomotion Nat. Rev.

Diversity of molecularly defined spinal interneurons engaged in mammalian locomotor pattern generation J. Neurophysiol. 2017; 118 :2956-2974 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, none of these interneurons is by itself necessary and sufficient for rhythm generation, which has led to the current view that rhythm generation is not mediated by a single, homogeneous group of excitatory neurons ( Kiehn, 2016 45. Kiehn, O. Decoding the organization of spinal circuits that control locomotion Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 :224-238 Crossref Scopus (495) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our study challenges this hypothesis and proposes that a single neuronal type initiates the locomotor CPG by demonstrating the necessity and sufficiency of VSCTs to produce locomotor activity. VSCTs are glutamatergic, project ipsilaterally, as well as contralaterally, and possess both intra- and inter-segmental axon collaterals making contacts with MNs, Chx10 + spinal neurons and likely other spinal neurons.
The CPG is active at birth and has been under investigations for decades utilizing the neonatal ex vivo spinal cord as an experimental system. By providing exceptional accessibility to the activity and function of CPG neurons, this approach combined with mouse genetics and physiological and anatomical assays has transformed our capabilities to unravel the organization of the locomotor CPG ( Jiang et al., 1999 41.

Activation of VGluT2 + neurons was shown to induce locomotor-like activity in neonates ( Hägglund et al., 2010 36. Hägglund, M. ∙ Borgius, L. ∙ Dougherty, K.J. ...

However, Sim1 + ( Zhang et al., 2008 92. Zhang, Y. ∙ Narayan, S. ∙ Geiman, E. ...

Neurophysiol. 2017; 118 :2956-2974 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, our findings show that VSCTs are VGluT2 + neurons essential for the induction of locomotor behavior.

Distribution of networks generating and coordinating locomotor activity in the neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro : a lesion study J. Neurosci. 1996; 16 :5777-5794 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and stimulation of MN axons ( Mentis et al., 2005 57. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Alvarez, F.J. ∙ Bonnot, A. ... Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). The latter is considered a puzzling observation, since MNs are thought to act solely as the mediators of central commands to skeletal muscles. However, MNs have recently been proposed to provide feedback to the CPG during locomotor activity ( Falgairolle et al., 2017 25. Falgairolle, M. ∙ Puhl, J.G. ∙ Pujala, A. ... Motoneurons regulate the central pattern generator during drug-induced locomotor-like activity in the neonatal mouse eLife. 2017; 6 :e26622 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2016 82. Song, J. ∙ Ampatzis, K. ∙ Björnfors, E.R. ... Motor neurons control locomotor circuit function retrogradely via gap junctions Nature. 2016; 529 :399-402 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these observations raised the possibility that MNs may contact a yet-unknown interneuron that is key for the locomotor CPG. However, silencing of Renshaw cells and Sim1 + interneurons, which are the only spinal interneurons contacted by MN axon collaterals known to date, did not affect locomotor rhythmogenesis ( Enjin et al., 2017 24. Enjin, A. ∙ Perry, S. ∙ Hilscher, M.M. ... Developmental disruption of recurrent inhibitory feedback results in compensatory adaptation in the Renshaw cell-motor neuron circuit J. Neurosci. 2017; 37 :5634-5647 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2008 92. Zhang, Y. ∙ Narayan, S. ∙ Geiman, E. ... V3 spinal neurons establish a robust and balanced locomotor rhythm during walking Neuron. 2008; 60 :84-96 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our identification of VSCTs as a target of MN axon collaterals provides an answer to this conundrum. VSCTs receive monosynaptic activation from MNs that is both cholinergic and glutamatergic in nature, consistent with previous findings that spinal MNs axon collaterals release both acetylcholine and glutamate or aspartate ( Mentis et al., 2005 57. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Alvarez, F.J. ∙ Bonnot, A. ... Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nishimaru et al., 2005 62. Nishimaru, H. ∙ Restrepo, C.E. ∙ Ryge, J. ... Mammalian motor neurons corelease glutamate and acetylcholine at central synapses Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :5245-5249 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ; Richards et al., 2014 73. Richards, D.S. ∙ Griffith, R.W. ∙ Romer, S.H. ... Motor axon synapses on Renshaw cells contain higher levels of aspartate than glutamate PLoS One. 2014; 9 :e97240 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations point to a positive feedback neuronal circuit between MNs and VSCTs that enables early, robust activation of VSCTs and subsequent activation of other neurons involved in locomotor behavior.
We also discovered that VSCTs are electrically coupled among themselves. What is the importance of this electrical coupling in the context of locomotor rhythmogenesis? In the developing mammalian spinal cord, locomotor-like rhythm generation can be produced solely through gap junctions ( Tresch and Kiehn, 2000 85. Tresch, M.C. ∙ Kiehn, O. Motor coordination without action potentials in the mammalian spinal cord Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3 :593-599 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that gap junctions among VSCTs are critical for the induction of locomotor rhythmogenesis. Accordingly, we reveal that gap junction blockade using carbenoxolone abolishes locomotor behavior induced in neonates by (1) direct photoactivation of VSCTs, (2) sensory stimulation, or (3) MN axon stimulation. Electrical communication among spinal neurons is thought to be an important circuit mechanism in the locomotor CPG ( Ziskind-Conhaim and Hochman, 2017 94. Ziskind-Conhaim, L. ∙ Hochman, S. Diversity of molecularly defined spinal interneurons engaged in mammalian locomotor pattern generation J. Neurophysiol. 2017; 118 :2956-2974 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we argue that a key function of electrical coupling among VSCTs is to synchronize their activity. In addition, chemical neurotransmission may not be necessary for the production of rhythmic output across the rostro-caudal axis since photoactivation of VSCTs in either the rostral (L1/L2) or the caudal (L4/L5) spinal segments resulted in robust locomotor activity.
Intriguingly, some VSCTs also communicate electrically with MNs via gap junctions. Neonatal mammalian MNs are electrically coupled among themselves only during the first two postnatal weeks ( Chang et al., 1999 15. Chang, Q. ∙ Gonzalez, M. ∙ Pinter, M.J. ... Gap junctional coupling and patterns of connexin expression among neonatal rat lumbar spinal motor neurons J. Neurosci. 1999; 19 :10813-10828 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Mentis et al., 2002 59. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Díaz, E. ∙ Moran, L.B. ... Increased incidence of gap junctional coupling between spinal motoneurones following transient blockade of NMDA receptors in neonatal rats J. Physiol. 2002; 544 :757-764 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Personius et al., 2007 67. Personius, K.E. ∙ Chang, Q. ∙ Mentis, G.Z. ... Reduced gap junctional coupling leads to uncorrelated motor neuron firing and precocious neuromuscular synapse elimination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :11808-11813 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Walton and Navarrete, 1991 87. Walton, K.D. ∙ Navarrete, R. Postnatal changes in motoneurone electrotonic coupling studied in the in vitro rat lumbar spinal cord J. Physiol. 1991; 433 :283-305 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings that VSCTs are electrically coupled with a subset of MNs indicate that electrical coupling is not selective among a single neuronal type. Moreover, an important implication of these findings is that depending on the extent and strength of coupling, the phase change in their respective membrane potential during the locomotor behavior will be similar and likely contribute to the recruitment of VSCTs, as well as the neuronal targets of their axon collaterals.
The observation that VSCTs possess rhythmogenic properties provides additional mechanistic support to their function as essential neurons for locomotor rhythmogenesis. VSCTs possess the I h current that has been previously implicated as a key cellular property in rhythmic behaviors, such as in the inspiratory pre-Bötzinger complex neurons in mice ( Thoby-Brisson et al., 2000 84. Thoby-Brisson, M. ∙ Telgkamp, P. ∙ Ramirez, J.M. The role of the hyperpolarization-activated current in modulating rhythmic activity in the isolated respiratory network of mice J. Neurosci. 2000; 20 :2994-3005 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) or in the rhythmic behavior of pyloric neurons of the stomato-gastric ganglion in lobsters ( Zhang et al., 2003 93. Zhang, Y. ∙ Oliva, R. ∙ Gisselmann, G. ... Overexpression of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) channel gene modifies the firing activity of identified motor neurons in a small neural network J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :9059-9067 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). I h is strongly activated by hyperpolarization ( Pape, 1996 65. Pape, H.C. Queer current and pacemaker: the hyperpolarization-activated cation current in neurons Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58 :299-327 Crossref Scopus (1001) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as in a time- and voltage-dependent membrane conductance. Although the precise role of I h in VSCTs during locomotor activity remains to be elucidated, it is possible that I h may limit the effect of rhythmic inhibition and cause the membrane potential to escape more rapidly from inhibition during locomotor activity. In addition, since I h regulates the post-inhibitory rebound potential and neuronal excitability, I h may also be involved in the acceleration of the arrival of the first AP and thus contribute to the enhanced recruitment of VSCTs. Finally, in tadpoles I h has been shown to mask an ultraslow AHP generated by sodium-potassium pumps that would normally inhibit activity ( Picton et al., 2018 68. Picton, L.D. ∙ Sillar, K.T. ∙ Zhang, H.Y. Control of Xenopus tadpole locomotion via selective expression of Ih in excitatory interneurons Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :3911-3923.e2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ); therefore, the presence of I h may also influence the excitability state of VSCTs.
VSCTs were first discovered by Cooper and Sherrington (1940) 18. Cooper, S. ∙ Sherrington, C.S. Gowers tract and spinal border cells Brain. 1940; 63 :123-134 Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar and have been hypothesized to serve as “efferent copies” of spinal motor networks ( Lundberg, 1971 49. Lundberg, A. Function of the ventral spinocerebellar tract A new hypothesis. Exp. Brain Res. 1971; 12 :317-330 PubMed Google Scholar ), whereby they provide the cerebellum with feedback information regarding the ongoing state of the ventral spinal cord. During repetitive motor tasks, like locomotion or scratching, signals from the spinal CPG evoke rhythmic activity in the cerebellar cortex whose outputs modulate the descending tracts that regulate the spinal rhythmic activity ( Grillner and Wallén, 1985 34. Grillner, S. ∙ Wallén, P. Central pattern generators for locomotion, with special reference to vertebrates Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1985; 8 :233-261 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Martínez-Silva et al., 2014 52. Martínez-Silva, L. ∙ Manjarrez, E. ∙ Gutiérrez-Ospina, G. ... Electrophysiological representation of scratching CpG activity in the cerebellum PLoS One. 2014; 9 :e109936 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morton and Bastian, 2003 61.

Adaptive changes in responses to repeated locomotor perturbations in cerebellar patients Exp. Brain Res. 1998; 122 :31-43 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cerebellum-brainstem-spinal cord loop is essential for coordinated and adaptive gait control. However, the cerebellum is not critical to generate locomotion, rather it modulates limb movement patterns, balance, and adaptation ( Hammar et al., 2011 37. Hammar, I. ∙ Krutki, P. ∙ Drzymala-Celichowska, H. ... A trans-spinal loop between neurones in the reticular formation and in the cerebellum J. Physiol. 2011; 589 :653-665 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pisotta and Molinari, 2014 69. Pisotta, I. ∙ Molinari, M. Cerebellar contribution to feedforward control of locomotion Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2014; 8 :475 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings that VSCTs are essential for the initiation and maintenance of locomotion imply that VSCTs are not purely a relay messenger of information as originally proposed. Instead, in addition to their role in coordinating locomotion at the spinal level, VSCT output to the cerebellum may be critical for the regulation of locomotion by the cerebellum and other supraspinal areas influenced by cerebellar output. To this end, and although the precise neuronal circuit mechanisms involving VSCTs in adult locomotion remain to be elucidated, our observations that Chx10 + spinal neurons are synaptic targets of VSCT axon collaterals in adults provides a potential insight. Chx10 + spinal neurons are known to be activated during adult locomotion ( Al-Mosawie et al., 2007 2. Al-Mosawie, A. ∙ Wilson, J.M. ∙ Brownstone, R.M. Heterogeneity of V2-derived interneurons in the adult mouse spinal cord Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26 :3003-3015 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) and have been shown to function in the maintenance of locomotor rhythmicity and in left-right alternation ( Crone et al., 2008 19. Crone, S.A. ∙ Quinlan, K.A. ∙ Zagoraiou, L. ... Genetic ablation of V2a ipsilateral interneurons disrupts left-right locomotor coordination in mammalian spinal cord Neuron. 2008; 60 :70-83 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar , 2009 20. Crone, S.A. ∙ Zhong, G. ∙ Harris-Warrick, R. ... In mice lacking V2a interneurons, gait depends on speed of locomotion J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :7098-7109 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we suggest that Chx10 + spinal neurons receive significant activation by VSCTs during adult locomotion and without which the animal’s locomotor ability is significantly compromised. The importance of the spinal axon collaterals of VSCTs versus their main ascending axon to the cerebellum for the induction of locomotor behavior is underscored by observations in which in vivo adult spinalized mice were able to produce fictive locomotion ( Meehan et al., 2012 54. Meehan, C.F. ∙ Grondahl, L. ∙ Nielsen, J.B. ... Fictive locomotion in the adult decerebrate and spinal mouse in vivo J.

Protoc. 2017; 12 :732-747 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, cerebellectomy has been shown to have little impact on the ability of other organisms to locomote, including fish ( Roberts et al., 1992 74. Roberts, B.L. ∙ van Rossem, A. ∙ de Jager, S. The influence of cerebellar lesions on the swimming performance of the trout J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 167 :171-178 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), rats ( Federico et al., 2006 26. Federico, F. ∙ Leggio, M.G. ∙ Mandolesi, L. ... The NMDA receptor antagonist CGS 19755 disrupts recovery following cerebellar lesions Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. 2006; 24 :1-7 PubMed Google Scholar ), cats ( Udo et al., 1980 86. Udo, M. ∙ Matsukawa, K. ∙ Kamei, H. ... Cerebellar control of locomotion: effects of cooling cerebellar intermediate cortex in high decerebrate and awake walking cats J.

Locomotor behavior of decerebellated arboreal mammals--monkey and raccoon J. Comp. Neurol. 1974; 157 :53-85 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as in humans either due to cerebellum agenesis or cerebellar resection due to tumors ( Earhart and Bastian, 2001 21.

In conclusion, we discovered that VSCTs are both necessary and sufficient for locomotor behavior and that they are core components of the locomotor CPG. It also provides the conceptual foundation for developing therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from spinal cord injury and motor disorders.
One limitation of our study is that we cannot fully exclude the potential involvement of DSCTs in locomotor behavior in adult mice as we demonstrated in neonatal mice. The optogenetic approaches used in neonates cannot be employed in adult mice for technical reasons. However, DSCTs, including Clarke’s column neurons, do not possess axon collaterals in the cat ( Edgley and Gallimore, 1988 23. Edgley, S.A. ∙ Gallimore, C.M. The morphology and projections of dorsal horn spinocerebellar tract neurones in the cat J. Physiol. 1988; 397 :99-111 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Houchin et al., 1983 38. Houchin, J. ∙ Maxwell, D.J. ∙ Fyffe, R.E. ... Light and electron microscopy of dorsal spinocerebellar tract neurones in the cat: an intracellular horseradish peroxidase study Q. J. Exp. Physiol. 1983; 68 :719-732 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas VSCTs possess spinal axon collaterals both in cats ( Bras et al., 1988 12. Bras, H. ∙ Cavallari, P. ∙ Jankowska, E. Demonstration of initial axon collaterals of cells of origin of the ventral spinocerebellar tract in the cat J. Comp. Neurol. 1988; 273 :584-592 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in mice (this study). If DSCTs indeed lack spinal axon collaterals as is the case in cat, it is conceivable that DSCTs do not have access to spinal locomotor circuits and therefore might not be involved in locomotor rhythmogenesis. To further dissect the direct role of these two SCTs, future experiments are needed in which yet-to-be identified genetic markers that selectively label DSCTs and VSCTs could be used to either activate or silence them selectively using Cre-Lox recombination and floxed chemogenetic approaches.

All surgical procedures were performed on postnatal mice in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the Care and Use of Animals and approved by the Columbia Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animals of both sexes were used in this study.
The original breeder pairs of C57BL6 mice (Jax Stock #000664), lsl -Channelrhodopsin2 mice (Ai32; Jax Stock #024109), lsl -hM4Di (inhibitory DREADDs) mice (Jax Stock #026219), lsl -Archaerhodopsin-3 mice (Ai40D; Jax Stock #021188), and fsf-lsl -hM4Di (inhibitory DREADDs) mice (Jax Stock #029040) used in this study were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. The Cdx2-NSE-FlpO mice (Jax Stock #030288) were a kind gift by Dr. David Ginty (Harvard University). The Chx10-CRE mice were a kind gift by Dr. Tom Jessell (Columbia University).
Genotyping protocols were carried out using standard procedures as described in detail on the Jackson website ( www.jax.org ). In brief, at P0 (postnatal day 0) tail DNA was extracted from mice and lysed using lysis buffer (100mM Tris pH 8, 5mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200mM NaCl, 100 μg/ml Proteinase K) for 45 minutes at 55°C. PCR primers used to genotype are described on the Jackson website ( www.jax.org ). A universal PCR reaction consisted of: 12.5 μl of GoTaq Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega), 0.5 μl of each primer (25 μM; Sigma), and 4 μl of 1:20 diluted lysed tail DNA into a final volume of 25 μl using ddH 2 O. For the lsl -Channelrhodopsin2 mice, the lsl -Archaerhodopsin-3 mice, the lsl -hM4Di mice, and the fsf-lsl -hM4Di mice the following PCR parameters were used: 95°C for 2 mins, followed by 35 cycles of [95°C for 40 secs, 59°C for 30 secs, 72°C for 1 min], and 72°C for 5 mins. Additional information for oligonucleotides are shown in Table S1 .
Many of the immunohistochemistry protocols have been previously described ( Fletcher et al., 2017 27. Fletcher, E.V. ∙ Simon, C.M. ∙ Pagiazitis, J.G. ... Reduced sensory synaptic excitation impairs motor neuron function via Kv2.1 in spinal muscular atrophy Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :905-916 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mentis et al., 2011 58. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Blivis, D. ∙ Liu, W. ... Early functional impairment of sensory-motor connectivity in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy Neuron. 2011; 69 :453-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, animals were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA, spinal cords dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C overnight. Transverse 75μm sections were cut on a vibratome after embedding in warm 5% Agar. After blocking in 10% normal donkey serum in 0.01M PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T; pH 7.4), sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies in the blocking solution. Primary antibodies used in this study included: ChAT, Goat, 1:100 (Millipore); VAChT, Guinea pig, 1:2000 (custom); GFP, Chicken, 1:1000 (Aves Labs, Inc.); GFP, Rabbit, 1:100 (Novus); DsRed, Rabbit, 1:100 (Takara); HA, Rabbit, 1:100 (Abcam); NeuN, Mouse, 1:500 (Millipore); Synaptophysin, Guinea pig, 1:1000 (Synaptic Systems); Parvalbumin, Chicken, 1:20000 (custom); VGluT1, Guinea pig, 1:5000 (custom); VGluT2, Guinea Pig, 1:500 (Millipore); AnkG, 1:500, Rabbit (Santa Cruz). To reveal neurons that were recorded from intracellularly and filled with Neurobiotin, spinal cords were immersion fixed in 4% PFA overnight. Subsequently, streptavidin-Cy3 (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:100. Streptavidin was applied to the spinal cord sections and incubated overnight at room temperature along with any primary antibodies in the blocking solution. The following day, sections were washed in PBS-T and incubated with the appropriate species-specific secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted at 1:250 in PBS-T for 3 hours at room temperature. Sections were washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides with 70% glycerol / 30% PBS.
Sections were imaged using either a SP5 or SP8 Leica confocal microscope. Images were scanned with either a 20x air objective, 40x oil objective, or 63x oil objective. All images were analyzed in either LASAF software (Leica) or ImageJ software. For VSCT neuron transduction counts, we analyzed z-stack images (at 3 μm intervals) of each section. VSCT neuronal counts were performed with confocal microscopy in 75μm thick sections. We established that the L1 spinal segment in P45 mice extends in the rostro-caudal axis over 17 transverse sections (75 μm thickness). The number of VSCT was determined by counting all neurons ventral to the medio-lateral line emanating from the central canal, through z-stack scanning at 0.5 μm z-axis intervals. This was repeated in three L1 spinal cord transverse sections. The average number of VSCT from these sections was multiplied by 17 (the total number of sections within the L1 spinal segment). The number of VSCT neurons was calculated from the projection image obtained by all z-stack optical sections for every one of the 3 randomly chosen L1 transverse spinal cord sections. The same method was also applied for DSCTs and VSCTs for neuronal counts at P4-P5. At P4-P5, the number of sections in the L1 segment was 11. To determine the number of DSCTs and VSCTs at P4-P5, the number of VSCTs and DSCTs was calculated from the projection image obtained by all z-stack optical sections for every one of three randomly chosen L1 transverse spinal cord sections and multiplied by 11 (the total number of sections within the L1 spinal segment at P4-P5). DSCTs were defined as the all neurons positioned dorsal to the medio-lateral line emanating from the central canal.
For dye coupling confocal microscopy analysis, a single VSCT neuron was recorded, filled and analyzed per each mouse (n=12 VSCTs from N=12 mice).
In some experiments, motor neurons and sensory fibers entering the spinal cord were labelled by orthograde and anterograde fills using the ex vivo spinal cord. Details have been previously reported ( Mentis et al., 2005 57. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Alvarez, F.J. ∙ Bonnot, A. ... Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar , 2011 58. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Blivis, D. ∙ Liu, W. ... Early functional impairment of sensory-motor connectivity in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy Neuron. 2011; 69 :453-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the spinal cord was dissected free under in vitro conditions at ∼10°C and continuously superfused with artificial CSF (aCSF). The appropriate ventral and dorsal roots were positioned in suction electrodes and backfilled with either: i) Texas Red Dextran, ii) Cascade Blue Dextran or iii) Fluorescein Dextran [10,000 molecular weight (MW)] for ∼24 h (at 10°C) to label motor neurons (from a ventral root) or sensory fibers (from a dorsal root). Following this period, the appropriate lumbar segments immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. The spinal cord was embedded in 5% warm agar and subsequently sectioned (75μm) using a Vibratome. The sections were collected in wells and processed further for immunohistochemistry against different antibodies by free-floating method (in wells). Finally, sections were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped using an antifading agent (PBS/glycerol, 7:3) until examination with confocal microscopy.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization protocols were carried out as recently reported ( Simon et al., 2017 80. Simon, C.M. ∙ Dai, Y. ∙ Van Alstyne, M. ... Converging mechanisms of p53 activation drive motor neuron degeneration in spinal muscular atrophy Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3767-3780 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fresh spinal cord tissue (L1 and L2 segments) was cryopreserved in sterile 30% sucrose overnight and flash frozen in OCT on dry ice at P4. 18-20μm sections were cut on a cryostat and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 minutes. Washes were carried out as follows: 3x PBS, 1x PBS-T 10 minutes (0.1% Triton X-100), 1x PBS. Acetylation was performed for 15 minutes in 1.17% (v/v) triethanolamine and 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride in ddH 2 O. 3x PBS washes were followed by overnight hybridization with the RNA probe at 68°C in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5X SSC, 1X Denhart’s, 1mg/ml baker’s yeast RNA in ddH 2 O) in a humidifying chamber. The probe was applied at 1ng/μL following denaturation through 5 minutes of warming at 85°C.
The following day, sections were washed with 0.2% SSC 2x for 15 minutes at 68°C, followed by 3x PBS washes. Blocking solution was then applied for 1 hour at room temperature (0.5% Blocking reagent [Roche] in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl; pH 7.5). Sections were then incubated with anti-digoxigenin-AP 1:500 (Roche) dissolved in blocking solution for 1 hour at 37°C. Sections were washed for 10 minutes 3x in Washing Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5). Sections were washed for 10 minutes 2x in Detection Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , pH 8.0). Development was done with the HNPP Fluorescent Detection Set (Roche) as per the manufacturer’s instructions for 1 hour. Sections were washed in dH 2 O and mounted with 2% DABCO in 50% glycerol/PBS to preserve fluorescence.
The RNA probe for VGlut2 was obtained through a PCRII-Topo VGlut2 in situ probe vector from the laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Macklis deposited in Addgene as plasmid #45639 ( https://www.addgene.org ). For probe generation from the linearized plasmid, RNA transcription was conducted in the presence of digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides (Roche). After transcription, probes were precipitated overnight in 410μl precipitation solution (75% EtOH, 0.25 M TE buffer, 100 mM LiCl) at -20°C. The following day, the probes were precipitated through spinning at 13,000 RPM and the supernatant decanted. The probes were washed in 1 ml of 70% ethanol, spun at 13,000 RPM, and the supernatant decanted followed by re-suspension in hybridization solution at 10 ng/μl.
VSCTs were retrogradely labeled in vivo by intracerebellar injection of cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) conjugated to Alexa-488, Alexa-555, or Alexa-647 (Invitrogen). Newborn P0 mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation. A small incision and craniotomy over the cerebellum was made to inject ∼200-600nl of 0.5-1% fluorescently-conjugated CTb in PBS using a finely-pulled glass microelectrode (P-1000 puller [Sutter Instruments]) under sterile conditions. The CTb was delivered by pressure through an adapted micro-syringe. The incision was closed with sutures. Upon dissection at P3-P5, the injection was determined to be accurate by visualization of fluorescence in the cerebellum under a fluorescence microscope (Leica) without spread to other brain tissue ( Figures S1 F and S1G).
For viral gene delivery, the following viruses were used: CAV2-CMV-GFP (CAV2 = Canine Adenovirus 2), titer = 1.3 x 10 13 pp/ml [Plateforme de Vectorologie de Montpellier]); CAV2-CMV-Cre, titer = 1.4 x 10 13 pp/ml; CAV2-CMV-Cre-GFP, titer = 1.3 x 10 13 pp/ml; Rabies-N2c-ChR2-YFP, titer = 1x10 9 infectious particles/ml; Rabies-N2c-EnvA-DsRed, titer = ∼5x10 8 infectious particles/ml, AAV2/1-Flex-nGFP-N2c-Gp-TVA; AAV9-ChB-DiO-eGFP, titer = 1.1 x 10 11 pp/ml (Vector BioLabs). The approximate volume of virus injected into the cerebellum was 0.5μl. WT mice of both sexes were injected intracerebellar at P0 with a 50/50 mixture of the CAV2 virus with 1% CTb-Alexa 555 or CTb-Alexa 647. At P3-P21, the spinal cord was processed for immunohistochemistry. Analysis of the extent of VSCT labeling consisted of comparing the number of VSCT neurons transduced by the virus with the number of VSCT neurons labeled by CTb using confocal images acquired with Leica confocal microscopes and analyzed with the Leica LASAF software. For the in vivo adult freely moving mice, mice were injected with the same viruses at P21 and examined at P35-45. For the Chx10-CRE mice experiments, AAV-Flex-nGFP-Gp-TVA was injected in the lumbar spinal cord at P0. Rabies-N2c-EnvA-DsRed was injected in the lumbar spinal cord at P10. To allow for transfection, mice were euthanized for the terminal experiments between P21-P28.
Many of the experimental protocols used in this study have been described previously ( Fletcher et al., 2017 27. Fletcher, E.V. ∙ Simon, C.M. ∙ Pagiazitis, J.G. ... Reduced sensory synaptic excitation impairs motor neuron function via Kv2.1 in spinal muscular atrophy Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :905-916 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mentis et al., 2011 58. Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Blivis, D. ∙ Liu, W. ... Early functional impairment of sensory-motor connectivity in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy Neuron. 2011; 69 :453-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). At P3-P5, the animals were decapitated, the spinal cords dissected and removed under cold (∼10°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 128.35 NaCl, 4 KCl, 0.58 NaH 2 PO 4 .H 2 O, 21 NaHCO 3 , 30 D-Glucose, 1.5 CaCl 2 .H 2 O, and 1 MgSO 4 .7H 2 O. The spinal cord was then transferred to a customized recording chamber placed under the objective of an upright confocal microscope (Leica SP5) equipped with a 2-photon laser (MaiTai DeepSee, Spectral Physics).
The intact ex vivo spinal cord preparation was perfused continuously with oxygenated (95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 ) aCSF (∼10 ml/min). The physiological solution was kept at room temperature, ranging between 21-25°C, which results in slower conduction velocity for neurons. The ventral root of the L1 or L2 and L5 spinal segments bilaterally were placed into suction electrodes for recording. All potentials were recorded in either DC or AC (0.1 Hz filter) (Cyberamp, Molecular Devices). Recordings were fed to an A/D interface (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices) and acquired with Clampex (v10.2, Molecular Devices) at a sampling rate of 10-20 kHz. Data were analyzed offline using Clampfit (v10.2, Molecular Devices). In some preparations, the cerebellum-brainstem-spinal cord was used, while in experiments in which locomotor-like behavior was induced either by electrical stimulation or with a cocktail of drugs, the T4-cauda equina spinal cord was used.
Whole-cell recordings were obtained with patch electrodes advanced through the lateral or ventral aspect of the spinal cord under visual guidance using 2-photon microscopy to visualize individual VSCT neurons. Patch electrodes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillary with filament (Sutter Instruments) using a P-1000 puller (Sutter Instruments) to resistances between 5–16 MΩ. The electrodes were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 10 NaCl, 130 K-Gluconate, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 1 MgCl 2 , 0.1 CaCl 2 and 1 Na 2 ATP, 0.1 Alexa-555 or Alexa-488 hydrazide (Life Technologies), and 0.5 mg/ml Neurobiotin (Vector Labs). pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.3 with KOH. The final osmolarity of the intracellular solution was 295–305 mOsm. Bridge balance was applied to all recordings. The liquid junction potential was calculated as −2 mV but was not corrected in any of the recordings. The identity of the recorded neuron as a VSCT neuron was confirmed during the experiment by evoking an antidromic action potential by stimulation of the cerebellum through a concentric electrode applied just under the surface of the vermis of the cerebellum (0.2-0.5 ms, 1.2-3x Threshold). Threshold was determined by the minimum intensity needed to evoke a response in 3 out of 5 consecutive trials at 0.1 Hz. Upon increasing the stimulation intensity, there was no change in the amplitude of the all-or-none action potential induced. In addition, VSCT neurons were also identified by the colocalization of CTb-conjugated fluorochrome injected in the cerebellum at P0, with the intracellular fluorescent dye contained in the intracellular electrode. VSCT neurons were accepted for analysis only if the following criteria were met: (i) stable resting membrane potential of at least −45 mV (ii) an overshooting action potential and (iii) at least 20 mins of recording.
Synaptic potentials were recorded from individual VSCT neurons (DC - 3 kHz, Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices) in response to a brief (0.2 ms, 40-100 μA, 0.1-10 Hz) stimulation (A365, current stimulus isolator, WPI, Sarasota, FL) of the ipsilateral homosegmental ventral root (L1 or L2). Recordings contaminated by spontaneous events were discarded. The holding potential of the VSCT was varied from -80 to -40 mV to test for chemical components of synaptic responses. The jitter test was used to test whether the response was monosynaptic ( Bikoff et al., 2016; Mendelsohn et al., 2015 8. Bikoff, J.B. ∙ Gabitto, M.I. ∙ Rivard, A.F. ... Spinal Inhibitory Interneuron Diversity Delineates Variant Motor Microcircuits Cell. 2016; 165 :207-219 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Mendelsohn, A.I. ∙ Simon, C.M. ∙ Abbott, L.F. ... Activity regulates the incidence of heteronymous sensory-motor connections Neuron. 2015; 87 :111-123 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). The jitter test was conducted by analyzing the coefficient of variation at differing frequencies of ventral root stimulation (0.1, 1, 5, and 10 Hz). As previously published, if the coefficient of variation did not change over increasing stimulation frequency, the synaptic connection was determined to be monosynaptic. Conversely, if the coefficient of variation increased over increasing stimulation frequency, the synaptic connection was determined to be polysynaptic. Sequential bath application of pharmacological antagonists was used to study the components of the ventral root stimulation-mediated response in VSCTs. Drugs were allowed to perfuse into the spinal cord for at least 15 minutes or longer prior to stimulation. Mecamylamine, a nicotinic receptor antagonist, was used at a concentration of 50μM (Tocris). NBQX, an AMPA receptor antagonist, was used at a concentration of 20μM (Tocris). Carbenoxolone, a gap junction antagonist, was used at a concentration of 100μM (Tocris).
I h current was tested by negative current injection with examination of the resulting voltage trace for the characteristic sag and post-inhibitory rebound. Sag was calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the most negative voltage reached during negative current injection and the stable plateau voltage potential. Post-inhibitory rebound was calculated as the difference between the least negative voltage reached immediately after negative current injection and the voltage prior to current injection. Time-dependency of the sag and post-inhibitory rebound was tested by injecting steps of negative current (-200 to -500 pA) over different durations (ranging from 250 ms to 5 s with steps of 250-500 ms). Traces were examined for increased sag and post-inhibitory rebound with longer negative current injections. Voltage-dependency of the sag and post-inhibitory rebound was tested by injecting a varying negative current (ranging from -50 to -600 pA with steps of 50 pA) over a set duration (1 s to 2 s). Traces were examined for increased sag and post-inhibitory rebound with larger negative current injections which resulted in increased voltage changes in the recorded neuron. ZD7288, an HCN channel antagonist, was used at a concentration of 100 μM (Tocris).
At the end of the recording session, the electrode was removed from the spinal cord, but kept in the bath to measure any DC offset that might have occurred over the course of the recording. DC offset varied from -2 mV to +1 mV and due its low amplitude was not corrected in any of the recordings. The spinal cord was fixed in 4% PFA overnight and subsequently transferred to PBS and processed for immunohistochemistry.
Experimental protocols used in this study have been described before ( Fletcher et al., 2017 27. Fletcher, E.V. ∙ Simon, C.M. ∙ Pagiazitis, J.G. ...

Noncholinergic excitatory actions of motoneurons in the neonatal mammalian spinal cord Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :7344-7349 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). After dissection and intracellular recording, the spinal cord was transferred back to the dissection chamber and the L1 or L2 ventral root was placed inside a suction electrode and backfilled with a Cascade Blue-Dextran (Invitrogen) to label the motor neurons. The spinal cord was perfused with cold (∼10°C), oxygenated (95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 ) aCSF (containing in mM: 128.35 NaCl, 4 KCl, 0.58 NaH 2 PO 4 .H 2 O, 21 NaHCO 3 , 30 D-Glucose, 0.1 CaCl 2 .H 2 O, and 2 MgSO 4 .7H 2 O). After 12 – 20 hours, the cord was immersion-fixed in 4% PFA and washed in 0.01M PBS. Sections were subsequently processed for immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.
Spinal cord sections were cut at 75μm and processed for immunohistochemistry to enhance GFP with an anti-GFP antibody. In addition, motor neurons were labelled with ChAT immunoreactivity. In some experiments, the axon identity was verified by AnkG immunoreactivity. Single optical planes were acquired in Z-stacks at 1μm intervals for the entire thickness of the spinal cord section (∼75μm). Sections were scanned using an SP5 Leica confocal microscope and analyzed using ImageJ and Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience).
For the colocalization of CTb-488, VGluT2 and synaptophysin signals ( Figure S7 ) to mark the synapses from SCT axon collaterals, confocal images acquired with LAS (Leica) software were exported to ImageJ software as TIF format files. Then, the different channels were merged and further saved as TIF. In ImageJ software, the channels were split and the threshold adjusted. For each channel we apply the “Subtract 254” math module once. Then two channels were added together and the “threshold” was set to 2-255. This image was then converted-to-mask. For the third channel, was “made binary” and was “added” to the image processed by the addition of the first two channels.
The detailed experimental protocol used in this study has been described before ( Bonnot et al., 2005 9. Bonnot, A. ∙ Mentis, G.Z. ∙ Skoch, J. ... Electroporation loading of calcium-sensitive dyes into the CNS J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93 :1793-1808 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, at P4, the spinal cord of wild type mice was dissected and pinned down with the ventral side up, and a broken sharp glass electrode was used to pressure-apply 2μl of calcium-sensitive dye solution under the dura matter in the rostral lumbar area (L1/L2). The calcium sensitive dye calcium green-1 hexapotassium salt (1,147 MW, 55mM; Thermofisher Scientific), was dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; as above) prior to application. Two gold-plated electrodes (BTX, 3mm in length and 0.5 mm in diameter) were submerged in the aCSF and positioned in parallel on either side of the spinal cord. Square voltage pulses (10-50 V applied voltage, 50-100 ms duration, 4-10 pulses at 1 Hz) were applied between the electrodes within 5min after dye application using the ECM 830 electroporation system (BTX). The dura mater was removed from the lateral sides to allow visualization of the labeled cells. After electroporation, the cord was left for ∼1 h to allow washout of the excess of dye from the extracellular space. The spinal cord was subsequently transferred to a customized recording chamber for electrical and optical recordings (as above). The lateral side of the lumbar spinal cord was imaged continuously under two-photon microscopy, while a ventral root was stimulated. Analysis of the fluorescent signal was conducted in Leica LASAF software using the region of interest (ROI) function.
Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation experiments were carried out in either lsl -Channelrhodopsin2 mice, lsl -hM4Di mice, or lsl -Archaerhodopsin-3 mice, as appropriate. All mice were homozygotes for the inserted transgene. In some mice, Rabies-N2C-ChR2-YFP was also used to express ChR2 in SCT neurons following cerebellum injection. P0 mice were injected intracerebellar with the CAV2-Cre or CAV2-Cre-GFP (or CAV2-GFP as control) viral vector along with fluorescently-labeled CTb, as described above. At P3-P6, the spinal cord was dissected and the ex vivo neonate spinal cord preparations were transferred to the recording chamber for physiological recordings as described above. The ventral roots of the L1 and L5 spinal segments bilaterally were placed into suction electrodes, along with the L5 dorsal root and/or S3 dorsal root ganglion as described above.
For VSCT neuron activation experiments utilizing Channelrhodopsin2, 470nm light was delivered via a LED (CoolLED; pE-100) placed over the L1 and L2 segments bilaterally on the ventral surface of the spinal cord. For DSCT neuron activation, dorsal illumination was used over the L1 and L2 segments bilaterally in the same ex vivo spinal cord preparations used for VSCT activation, by flipping over the spinal cord and replacing the suction electrodes. LED power ranged between 53-106mW. Light was delivered with either continuous illumination for 20s or pulses of light for 100ms at 5Hz or 50ms at 10Hz for 20s. Light was delivered via a customized patch cable built by Thorlabs, Inc. Recording commenced with 1-10 seconds pre-light to establish a baseline, followed by light stimulation. Each preparation was tested for a minimum of three trials. All potentials were recorded in either DC or AC (0.1 Hz filter) (Cyberamp, Molecular Devices). For consistent Channelrhodopsin2 activation, all experiments were conducted in the presence of 1-3 μM all trans-Retinal (Sigma-Aldrich) in the aCSF. Pharmacological antagonism was used to test for the necessity of the h-current and gap junction communication in the production of locomotor-like activity following VSCT neuron photoactivation. Drugs were bath applied into the circulating aCSF and allowed to perfuse into the spinal cord for at least 15mins.
For inhibition experiments utilizing Archaerhodopsin-3, locomotor activity was induced via electrical stimulation of the S3 dorsal root ganglia. After successful induction of locomotion, 585nm light was delivered via a LED (CoolLED; pE-100) placed over the L1 and L2 segments bilaterally on the ventral surface of the spinal cord at the same time of electrically-induced locomotor-like activity. LED power was 47mW. For consistent Archaerhodopsin-3 activation, all experiments were conducted in the presence of 1-3 μM all trans-Retinal (Sigma-Aldrich) in the aCSF. Each condition was tested for a minimum of three trials. Analysis consisted of quantifying the locomotor frequency in each trace under each condition offline on Clampfit (v10.2, Molecular Devices).
For inhibition experiments utilizing inhibitory DREADDs, locomotor activity was induced via electrical stimulation of the L5 dorsal root, S3 dorsal root ganglion, or stimulation of a ventral root or through bath application of the pharmacological cocktail of drugs consisting of NMDA (5μM; Tocris), serotonin (10μM; Tocris), and dopamine (50μM; Tocris). For control experiments, CAV2-GFP was injected at P0 into the cerebellum. After successful induction of locomotion, 10μM CNO (Tocris) was bath applied in the aCSF and allowed to freely circulate for 15-30 minutes. Induced locomotor activity was then investigated assayed in the pharmacological experiments. CNO was washed out using fresh aCSF and following 30+ minutes of washout, locomotor activity was induced again under the same conditions prior to CNO exposure. Each condition (pre-drug, CNO, washout) was tested for a minimum of three trials. Analysis consisted of quantifying the locomotor frequency in each trace under each condition offline on Clampfit (v10.2, Molecular Devices).
In vivo behavioral experiments were carried out by crossing Cdx2-NSE-FlpO mice ( Britz et al., 2015 13. Britz, O. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Grossmann, K.S. ... A genetically defined asymmetry underlies the inhibitory control of flexor-extensor locomotor movements eLife. 2015; 4 :e04718 Google Scholar ) with fsf-lsl- hM4Di (inhibitory DREADDs) mice. The resulting double transgenic pups were heterozygotes for both inserted transgenes. P21 mice were injected intracerebellar with either CAV2-GFP-CRE viral vector, or CAV2-GFP, or CTb-647, as described above. Control mice consisted of mice injected with CAV2-GFP. A few mice (n=3) were co-injected with CAV2-GFP-CRE and CTb-647 for presence of HA in VSCTs labelled with CTb-647.
Mice were allowed to move freely in the open field assay with the Mouse NeuroBehavior Core at Columbia University. At P35-45, each mouse was injected intraperitoneally with 5mg/kg CNO (Tocris Cat. #4936). We opted to utilize the 5mg/kg CNO dose as it has been reported to be the optimal dosage for in vivo CNO injections ( Manvich et al., 2018 51. Manvich, D.F. ∙ Webster, K.A. ∙ Foster, S.L. ... The DREADD agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO) is reverse-metabolized to clozapine and produces clozapine-like interoceptive stimulus effects in rats and mice Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :3840 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were then placed in the center of a clear Plexiglas arena (40 x 40 x 40 cm, Med Associates ENV-510) lit with dim light (∼30 lux). Infrared beams embedded along the X, Y, Z axes of the arena automatically tracked distance moved and horizontal movement. Mice were allowed to ambulate freely for ∼30 minutes. Data were collected into 10-minute intervals and total distance traveled for the first 10min after CNO injection and the last 10min for every hour (for the total of 6 hours) after CNO injection was analyzed using SOF-812 Activity Monitor software (Med Associates Inc.). The investigator was blind to the in vivo open field assay data set test which was revealed at the end of the analysis.
After the experiment was concluded, mice were euthanized and examined for quality of the injection by cerebellum fluorescence from the CTb under an epifluorescent microscope and from immunohistochemistry and confocal scanning of the L1 segment of the spinal cord.
The temperature of the water bath was maintained at ∼30C to avoid introducing temperature-bias measurements for all experiments. Mice were naïve in the swim test. Mice were tested once before CNO injection and 3 hours after 10mg/kg CNO injection. The swim test was set for 30sec to comply with IACUC guidelines. A high speed frame acquisition video camera was used for videography (Marshall, USB3.0) equipped with a 2.8mm IR1/2.5” 3MP C lens. The camera was connected to a PC laptop using OBS Studio 27.0.1 (64bit) software. Videos were acquired at 60 frames per second (fps) at 1280x720 resolution. Videos were save in MKV format. For analysis, the software VLC 3.016 Vetinari was used. Videos were saved in MP4 format after analysis.
The L5 dorsal root or S3 dorsal root ganglion was placed into a suction electrode for stimulation to induce locomotor activity (10s, 4Hz, 0.2ms, 1.2-3x Threshold). Threshold was determined by the minimum intensity needed to evoke a response in 3 out of 5 consecutive trials at 0.1Hz. Locomotor-like activity was also induced following L5 ventral root stimulation (0.2 ms, 40-100μA, 0.1-10Hz) as well as through bath application of the pharmacological cocktail of drugs consisting of NMDA (5μM; Tocris), serotonin (10μM; Tocris), and dopamine (50μM; Tocris). Locomotor-like activity was defined by the three major criteria: i) cyclic rhythmic activity, ii) left-right alternation, and iii) flexor-extensor alternation (alternation between ipsilateral L1 and L5 spinal segments).
Quantification of the rhythmic activity in VSCT neurons was done using circular plots and circular statistics (Oriana v4.02). Locomotor cycle length was defined as the time between two consecutive flexor burst onsets (corresponding to 0 or 0°, for the first, and 1 or 360°, for the second, on a circular scale), for the spinal cord side ipsilateral to the recorded VSCT. Flexor bursts were defined as bursting in the L1 or L2 segment motor neurons, whereas extensor bursts were defined as bursting in the L5 segment motor neurons. Onset of the flexor burst was defined as 50% of the time interval between trough and peak of the filtered (integrated by first low pass filtering at 200 Hz, followed by high pass filtering at 10 Hz, rectification and then low pass filtering at 3Hz) L1 or L2 segment motor neuron activity, as previously reported ( Falgairolle et al., 2017 25. Falgairolle, M. ∙ Puhl, J.G. ∙ Pujala, A. ... Motoneurons regulate the central pattern generator during drug-induced locomotor-like activity in the neonatal mouse eLife. 2017; 6 :e26622 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The first VSCT action potential elicited during each burst of firing with respect to the recording from the homosegmental ventral root was analyzed. The timing of the onset of firing of the VSCT neuron compared to the onset of the flexor burst, normalized to the length of the locomotor cycle, was calculated. For each VSCT, the timing of the onset of action potential firing was plotted in a circular plot corresponding to the locomotor cycle. The mean timing of the first action potential was then calculated and plotted as a vector in the circular plot for each VSCT neuron. The length of the mean vector reflects how concentrated the values are around the mean vector, or the rhythmicity of that VSCT. To determine if the combined population of VSCTs exhibited rhythmic activity, the mean vector value from each of the individual VSCTs was then plotted in a circular plot corresponding to the locomotor cycle ( Figure 3 B 2 ). Using the Rayleigh Test, the statistical significance of the clustering of values around the mean vector was computed, reflecting whether that individual VSCT neuron fired in a rhythmic fashion. All recorded VSCT neurons had statistically significant rhythmic firing and were therefore included in further grouped analysis. The mean vector value, length of the mean vector, Raleigh Test Z Score, and p value for each of the 6 VSCT neurons were respectively: 1) 252 +/- 9°, 0.94, 3.5, p < 0.05; 2) 21 +/- 15°, 0.96, 2.8, p < 0.05; 3) 12 +/- 14°, 0.98, 2.9, p < 0.05; 4) 315 +/- 8°, 0.84, 3.6, p < 0.05; 5) 14 +/- 13°, 0.92, 3.4, p < 0.05; 6) 297 +/- 2°, 0.98, 4.75, p < 0.01. To determine if the combined population of VSCT neurons exhibited rhythmic activity, the mean vector value from each of the individual VSCT neurons was then plotted in a circular plot corresponding to the locomotor cycle. The mean timing of the first action potential for the population was calculated and plotted as a vector in a circular plot and the Rayleigh Test was conducted to test for statistical significance.
The locomotor-like activity analysis of rhythmic activity in VSCT neurons used circular statistics. For this analysis, statistical analysis was performed using Oriana v4.02. Statistical analysis was carried out with the Rayleigh Test. P values are indicated as follows: ∗ = P < 0.05; ∗∗ = P < 0.01; ∗∗∗ = P < 0.001, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. For all other analysis, statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. All results are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was carried out with the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, the two-tailed paired Student’s t-test, or with one-way ANOVA, as appropriate. Post-hoc analysis of one-way ANOVA statistical tests was conducted with Tukey’s post hoc test. P values are indicated as follows: ∗ = p < 0.05; ∗∗ = p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ = p < 0.001, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. No randomization was used.
