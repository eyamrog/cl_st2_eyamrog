Title: Extracellular DNA Promotes Efficient Extracellular Electron Transfer by Pyocyanin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms


Abstract: Summary

Redox cycling of extracellular electron shuttles can enable the metabolic activity of subpopulations within multicellular bacterial biofilms that lack direct access to electron acceptors or donors. How these shuttles catalyze extracellular electron transfer (EET) within biofilms without being lost to the environment has been a long-standing question. Here, we show that phenazines mediate efficient EET through interactions with extracellular DNA (eDNA) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Retention of pyocyanin (PYO) and phenazine carboxamide in the biofilm matrix is facilitated by eDNA binding. In vitro , different phenazines can exchange electrons in the presence or absence of DNA and can participate directly in redox reactions through DNA. In vivo , biofilm eDNA can also support rapid electron transfer between redox active intercalators. Together, these results establish that PYO:eDNA interactions support an efficient redox cycle with rapid EET that is faster than the rate of PYO loss from the biofilm.

Section: Introduction

Microbial biofilms are ubiquitous in natural and engineered contexts, spanning plant roots to chronic human infections to anaerobic digestors ( Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004 30. Hall-Stoodley, L. ∙ Costerton, J.W. ∙ Stoodley, P. Bacterial biofilms: from the natural environment to infectious diseases Nat. Rev.

Microbial biofilms in nature: unlocking their potential for agricultural applications J. Appl. Microbiol. 2020; 129 :199-211 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). As biofilms develop, metabolic stratification occurs, driven by steep concentration gradients of substrates, such as oxygen, that are consumed by cells at the biofilm periphery faster than the substrates can diffuse into the biofilm interior ( Stewart 2003 72. Stewart, P.S. Diffusion in biofilms J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185 :1485-1491 Crossref Scopus (896) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stewart and Franklin, 2008 73. Stewart, P.S. ∙ Franklin, M.J.

Indeed, oxidant limitation is a generic challenge for cells that inhabit biofilm microenvironments where electron donors are abundant, yet electron acceptors are not. One widespread strategy microbes employ to overcome this challenge is to channel electrons derived from intracellular metabolism to extracellular oxidants at a distance ( Shi et al., 2016 65. Shi, L. ∙ Dong, H. ∙ Reguera, G. ... Extracellular electron transfer mechanisms between microorganisms and minerals Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :651-662 Crossref Scopus (1127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Known as “extracellular electron transfer” (EET), this process requires electron carriers to bridge the gap, be they outer membrane-associated or extracellular cytochromes ( Richter et al., 2009 60.

The colorful world of extracellular electron shuttles Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 71 :731-751 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the putative molecular components underpinning different EET processes have been described in a variety of organisms, a detailed understanding of how these components achieve EET remains an important research goal across diverse systems.
In contrast to the rapid progress in understanding the molecular basis by which cytochromes and nanowires facilitate EET, less progress has been made on how soluble (physically diffusive) electron shuttles facilitate EET beyond interactions at the cell surface ( Light et al., 2018 43.

Shewanella secretes flavins that mediate extracellular electron transfer Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :3968-3973 Crossref Scopus (1603) PubMed Google Scholar ). In part, this is due to the challenges involved in identifying and studying small molecule metabolites within a complex extracellular matrix. Accordingly, to study extracellular electron shuttling, we have chosen to work with a model system that employs a relatively well studied and tractable set of shuttles called phenazines. Phenazines are colorful redox-active molecules produced by numerous microbial species including the bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Turner and Messenger, 1986 78. Turner, J.M. ∙ Messenger, A.J. Occurrence, biochemistry and physiology of phenazine pigment production Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1986; 27 :211-275 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chincholkar and Thomashow, 2013 11. Chincholkar, S. ∙ Thomashow, L. Microbial Phenazines: Biosynthesis, Agriculture and Health Springer Science & Business Media, 2013 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). P. aeruginosa strains are ubiquitous yet perhaps most well-known for their roles in chronic infections where their growth as biofilms renders them antibiotic tolerant and contributes to patient morbidity and mortality ( Costerton et al., 1999 16. Costerton, J.W. ∙ Stewart, P.S. ∙ Greenberg, E.P. Bacterial biofilms: a common cause of persistent infections Science. 1999; 284 :1318-1322 Crossref Scopus (9506) PubMed Google Scholar ); importantly, phenazines support the development of anoxic, antibiotic tolerant biofilm regions. Two dimensional mapping of phenazine production in the agar underlying colony biofilms has revealed that different phenazines localize to distinct zones ( Bellin et al., 2014 7. Bellin, D.L. ∙ Sakhtah, H. ∙ Rosenstein, J.K. ... Integrated circuit-based electrochemical sensor for spatially resolved detection of redox-active metabolites in biofilms Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3256 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 8. Bellin, D.L. ∙ Sakhtah, H. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Electrochemical camera chip for simultaneous imaging of multiple metabolites in biofilms Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10535 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we set out to better understand how phenazines facilitate EET within the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix.
Intriguingly, although the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix comprises a heterogeneous group of polymers ( Colvin et al., 2012 13. Colvin, K.M. ∙ Irie, Y. ∙ Tart, C.S. ... The Pel and Psl polysaccharides provide Pseudomonas aeruginosa structural redundancy within the biofilm matrix Environ. Microbiol. 2012; 14 :1913-1928 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar ), extracellular DNA (eDNA) from dead cells is a significant contributor ( Allesen-Holm et al., 2006 2. Allesen-Holm, M. ∙ Barken, K.B. ∙ Yang, L. ... A characterization of DNA release in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures and biofilms Mol.

USA. 2015; 112 :11353-11358 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ; Whitchurch et al., 2002 82. Whitchurch, C.B. ∙ Tolker-Nielsen, T. ∙ Ragas, P.C. ... Extracellular DNA required for bacterial biofilm formation Science. 2002; 295 :1487 Crossref Scopus (1656) PubMed Google Scholar ), accounting for the majority of the matrix polymers in some cases ( Steinberger and Holden, 2005 70. Steinberger, R.E. ∙ Holden, P.A. Extracellular DNA in single- and multiple-species unsaturated biofilms Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71 :5404-5410 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matsukawa and Greenberg, 2004 50. Matsukawa, M. ∙ Greenberg, E.P. Putative exopolysaccharide synthesis genes influence Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186 :4449-4456 Crossref Scopus (268) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phenazines have long been known to intercalate into double stranded DNA in vitro ( Hollstein and Van Gemert, 1971 33. Hollstein, U. ∙ Van Gemert, Jr., R.J. Interaction of phenazines with polydeoxyribonucleotides Biochemistry. 1971; 10 :497-504 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, it was suggested that the phenazine pyocyanin (PYO) can participate in DNA-mediated charge transfer in vitro ( Das et al., 2015 19. Das, T. ∙ Kutty, S.K. ∙ Tavallaie, R. ... Phenazine virulence factor binding to extracellular DNA is important for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :8398 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ), and phenazine-eDNA interactions might facilitate biofilm EET ( Das et al., 2015 19. Das, T. ∙ Kutty, S.K. ∙ Tavallaie, R. ... Phenazine virulence factor binding to extracellular DNA is important for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :8398 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the ability of PYO to stimulate cell lysis ( Das and Manefield, 2012 17. Das, T. ∙ Manefield, M. Pyocyanin promotes extracellular DNA release in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e46718 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ) changes according to the environment: when cells are oxidatively stressed (i.e., oxidant replete but reductant limited) and ATP limited, PYO is toxic; whereas when they are reductively stressed (i.e., reductant replete but oxidant limited), PYO promotes viability and biofilm aggregate expansion ( Meirelles and Newman, 2018 51. Meirelles, L.A. ∙ Newman, D.K. Both toxic and beneficial effects of pyocyanin contribute to the lifecycle of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 110 :995-1010 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Costa et al., 2017 15. Costa, K.C. ∙ Glasser, N.R. ∙ Conway, S.J. ... Pyocyanin degradation by a tautomerizing demethylase inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms Science. 2017; 355 :170-173 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation raises the intriguing possibility that cell lysis by a small percentage of the population early on might later promote EET once biofilms have developed anoxic zones where extracellular electron shuttles support metabolism. Although a variety of roles for eDNA in biofilms have been proposed, including serving as a structural support, nutrient, and/or genetic reservoir ( Flemming and Wingender, 2010 23. Flemming, H.-C. ∙ Wingender, J. The biofilm matrix Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :623-633 Crossref Scopus (6951) PubMed Google Scholar ), to our knowledge, that biofilm eDNA may facilitate EET has not been demonstrated.
The current model of phenazine redox cycling in biofilms can be broadly defined ( Figure 1 A). In anoxic regions, oxidized phenazines are reduced intracellularly by metabolic reactions that support these cells ( Jo et al., 2017 37. Jo, J. ∙ Cortez, K.L. ∙ Cornell, W.C. ...

Endogenous phenazine antibiotics promote anaerobic survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via extracellular electron transfer J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192 :365-369 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). These reduced phenazines are thought to physically diffuse through the extracellular matrix toward the oxic region where they react abiotically with molecular oxygen. The oxidized phenazines then return to the anoxic region of the biofilm to complete the redox cycle. Although studies have begun to characterize the reactions on either side of the redox cycle, very little is known about how phenazines operate in the intervening extracellular matrix. Theoretical studies suggest that physical diffusion of oxidized phenazine toward the biofilm interior and reduced phenazine toward the biofilm periphery may be fast enough to support the metabolism of the oxidant limited cells ( Glasser et al., 2017a 28. Glasser, N.R. ∙ Saunders, S.H. ∙ Newman, D.K. The colorful world of extracellular electron shuttles Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 71 :731-751 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kempes et al., 2014 42. Kempes, C.P. ∙ Okegbe, C. ∙ Mears-Clarke, Z. ... Morphological optimization for access to dual oxidants in biofilms Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :208-213 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ), but these models have assumed the biofilm is a closed system in which freely diffusing phenazines are not lost to the outer environment. It is well established, however, that phenazines can escape P. aeruginosa biofilms ( Ramos et al., 2010 58. Ramos, I. ∙ Dietrich, L.E. ∙ Price-Whelan, A. ... Phenazines affect biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in similar ways at various scales Res. Microbiol. 2010; 161 :187-191 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), which, if left unchecked, would greatly reduce the efficiency of phenazine redox cycling. This is a key challenge these biofilms must solve.
This study investigates how phenazine electron transfer may be reconciled with phenazine retention. Specifically, we ask: are phenazines retained and if so to what extent? What mechanisms of electron transfer are compatible with phenazine retention? Our motivation to answer these questions arises not only from a desire to constrain the model of phenazine redox cycling within P. aeruginosa biofilms, but more broadly, to identify a potentially generalizable strategy for how diverse electron shuttles enable EET.

Section: Results

We studied three major phenazine derivatives made by P. aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 ( Schroth et al., 2018 64. Schroth, M.N. ∙ Cho, J.J. ∙ Green, S.K. ..., Microbiology Society Publishing Epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in agricultural areas J. Med. Microbiol. 2018; 67 :1191-1201 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ): phenazine carboxylate (PCA), phenazine carboxamide (PCN), and pyocyanin (PYO); at the pH relevant for our experiments, the dominant form of PCA is negatively charged whereas PCN and PYO are uncharged ( Figure 1 B). Beyond studying wild-type (WT)-produced phenazines, we also determine the effects of individual synthetic phenazines on a mutant that does not produce phenazines, Δ phz (Δ phzA1 - G1 , Δ phzA2 - G2 ), or on a mutant that is also incapable of modifying PCA to make PCN and PYO, Δ phz ∗ ( Δ phz , Δ phzMS , Δ phzH ). Experiments were performed with two different types of biofilms: macroscopic colony biofilms grown on nutrient agar surfaces ( Figures 1 C and S1 A) and microscopic biofilms attached to the surfaces of an interdigitated microelectrode array (IDA) suspended in liquid medium. Phenazine-dependent biofilm phenotypes operate similarly at both scales ( Ramos et al., 2010 58. Ramos, I. ∙ Dietrich, L.E. ∙ Price-Whelan, A. ... Phenazines affect biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in similar ways at various scales Res. Microbiol. 2010; 161 :187-191 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), so we selected the biofilm cultivation method for any given experiment based on which was best suited to answering our specific research question.
First, we sought to quantify phenazine retention by colony biofilms ( Figures 1 C and 1D). We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify extracted endogenous phenazines from the biofilms and compared their concentrations to that in the underlying agar ( Figures 1 D–1F). Colony biofilms could be cleanly separated from the agar, because they were separated by a 0.2 μm membrane filter, which did not affect the results ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Overall, PCA, PCN, and PYO concentrations varied by more than 10-fold in the biofilms reaching concentrations of ∼15 μM PCA, ∼400 μM PCN, and ∼80 μM PYO. Comparing biofilm to agar concentrations showed that PCN and PYO were enriched in the biofilm 10-fold and 30-fold, respectively, while PCA reached similar concentrations in the biofilm and the agar ( Figures 1 E and 1F). This suggested that PCN and PYO were strongly retained by the biofilm and PCA was not. Lysing resuspended biofilm cells by sonication prior to phenazine quantification did not strongly affect the results ( Figure S1 D), indicating that the measured pools of phenazines were predominantly retained extracellularly rather than intracellularly.
To test if differential phenazine retention requires endogenous phenazines, we grew Δ phz ∗ colony biofilms with synthetic phenazines in the agar and quantified phenazines taken up by the biofilm. Incubation with ≥50 μM PYO resulted in >200 μM PYO accumulation in the biofilm ( Figure 1 G). PCN accumulated to a lesser extent, and PCA biofilm uptake was minimal (<50 μM) even with 200 μM added to the agar ( Figure 1 G). Δ phz ∗ colonies transferred from phenazine agar to fresh agar after 3 days of growth retained phenazines in the same pattern as the WT over 24 h ( Figure 1 H), demonstrating that the observed phenazine retention does not depend on endogenous phenazine production. WT colony biofilms exhibit relatively thick and smooth morphologies that contain deep anoxic regions that are thought to be supported by phenazine EET. Δ phz ∗ colony biofilms exhibit different colony morphologies that are thin and highly wrinkled, which is thought to be a physiological adaptation to maximize surface area and oxygen penetration in the absence of phenazines as shown for Δ phz ( Dietrich et al., 2013 21. Dietrich, L.E.P. ∙ Okegbe, C. ∙ Price-Whelan, A. ... Bacterial community morphogenesis is intimately linked to the intracellular redox state J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195 :1371-1380 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, only incubation of Δ phz ∗ colonies with exogenous PYO appreciably complemented the colony wrinkling phenotype ( Figure S1 A), demonstrating that retained PYO is used by the colony biofilm for phenazine EET metabolism in vivo . P. aeruginosa colony biofilms thus appear able to take up and use significant amounts of exogenous PYO, and PCN to a lesser extent. These results predict that colony biofilms contain an extracellular component that binds and effectively retains PYO and PCN, but not PCA.
Because we measured considerable biofilm-retained PYO and PCN that was insensitive to cell lysis by sonication, we hypothesized these phenazines might bind an abundant component of the biofilm extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix in P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilms is known to be composed primarily of two polymers: DNA from dead cells (eDNA) and the polysaccharide, Pel ( Colvin et al., 2011 12. Colvin, K.M. ∙ Gordon, V.D. ∙ Murakami, K. ... The pel polysaccharide can serve a structural and protective role in the biofilm matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7 :e1001264 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ; Das and Manefield, 2012 17. Das, T. ∙ Manefield, M. Pyocyanin promotes extracellular DNA release in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e46718 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), and recent work suggested that PYO intercalates into DNA in vitro ( Das et al., 2015 19. Das, T. ∙ Kutty, S.K. ∙ Tavallaie, R. ... Phenazine virulence factor binding to extracellular DNA is important for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :8398 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the hypothesis that eDNA in the biofilm matrix was responsible for binding phenazines, we quantified the binding affinity of oxidized PCA, PCN, and PYO for a 29 base pair double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule in vitro using isothermal titration calorimetry ( Figure 2 A). As expected, oxidized PCA showed no detectable binding because it is negatively charged, as is the phosphate backbone of DNA at pH 7. In contrast, oxidized PCN (K D = 194 μM; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 148–305 μM) and PYO (K D = 13 μM; 95% CI = 6.5–49 μM) both bind dsDNA, and their dominant forms are neutral at pH 7 ( Costa et al., 2017 15. Costa, K.C. ∙ Glasser, N.R. ∙ Conway, S.J. ... Pyocyanin degradation by a tautomerizing demethylase inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms Science. 2017; 355 :170-173 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results are consistent with ethidium bromide displacement and microscale thermophoresis binding assays ( Figures S2 A and S2B) ( Das et al., 2015 19. Das, T. ∙ Kutty, S.K. ∙ Tavallaie, R. ... Phenazine virulence factor binding to extracellular DNA is important for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :8398 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, these in vitro phenazine-DNA binding affinities correlate with their in vivo retention ratio ([biofilm]/[agar]), where PYO is retained in the biofilm significantly more than PCN, and PCA is not retained. Reduced PYO showed no change in endogenous fluorescence upon addition of calf thymus DNA ( Figure S2 C), suggesting that the DNA binding affinity of PYO is redox dependent.
To determine whether phenazine-eDNA binding occurs in vivo , we treated 3-day-old WT biofilms with DNase I for 24 h. These experiments were performed with DNase I spotted on tryptone agar medium rather than its optimal buffer, as controls showed that buffer alone significantly disturbed the biofilm ( Figures S3 A–S3C). A previous study also observed that mature P. aeruginosa biofilms were minimally affected by DNase and suggested that extracellular proteases may inactivate DNase ( Whitchurch et al., 2002 82. Whitchurch, C.B. ∙ Tolker-Nielsen, T. ∙ Ragas, P.C. ... Extracellular DNA required for bacterial biofilm formation Science. 2002; 295 :1487 Crossref Scopus (1656) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite a low activity for DNase under these conditions, DNase-treated biofilms retained significantly lower biofilm PCN and PYO concentrations than their untreated counterparts; moreover, PCA concentration was unchanged ( Figure 2 B). P. aeruginosa eDNA originates from the genomic DNA of dead cells, is high molecular weight and bound by other biomolecules ( Kavanaugh et al., 2019 40. Kavanaugh, J.S. ∙ Flack, C.E. ∙ Lister, J. ... Identification of Extracellular DNA-Binding Proteins in the Biofilm Matrix MBio. 2019; 10 :e01137-19 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ); accordingly, complete elimination of phenazine binding sites with DNase is not expected. We also compared the phenazine retention in the WT to a Pel mutant (Δ pel ) and found that biofilms without Pel retained significantly more PYO ( Figure 2 C). Because Pel, the dominant exopolysaccharide in PA14 biofilms is known to bind eDNA ( Jennings et al., 2015 34. Jennings, L.K. ∙ Storek, K.M. ∙ Ledvina, H.E. ... Pel is a cationic exopolysaccharide that cross-links extracellular DNA in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm matrix Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :11353-11358 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ), these results suggest that Pel may partially block access to eDNA by PYO, although this remains to be tested in vitro . Because eDNA and Pel are the primary matrix constituents of PA14 biofilms ( Colvin et al., 2011 12. Colvin, K.M. ∙ Gordon, V.D. ∙ Murakami, K. ... The pel polysaccharide can serve a structural and protective role in the biofilm matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7 :e1001264 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ; Das and Manefield, 2012 17. Das, T. ∙ Manefield, M. Pyocyanin promotes extracellular DNA release in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e46718 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), that PYO was well retained in Δ pel biofilms indicates that eDNA is the dominant matrix component responsible for its retention.
To further test if phenazine-eDNA binding occurs in vivo , we competed phenazines against ethidium bromide, a well-known DNA intercalator. Because PCN and PYO compete for DNA binding sites with ethidium in vitro ( Figure S2 A), and ethidium is largely excluded from cells ( Jernaes and Steen, 1994 35. Jernaes, M.W. ∙ Steen, H.B. Staining of Escherichia coli for flow cytometry: influx and efflux of ethidium bromide Cytometry. 1994; 17 :302-309 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reasoned that these intercalators could compete for binding sites in the biofilm eDNA. We grew Δ phz ∗ biofilms with 50 μM oxidized PCN or oxidized PYO and increasing amounts of ethidium in the underlying agar. Figure 2 D shows that increasing concentrations of ethidium resulted in successively less PYO accumulating in the biofilms, while PCN accumulated to a similar lower level in the presence of any amount of added ethidium. These results demonstrate that more than 50% of biofilm-accumulated PYO resides in binding sites that can be competitively inhibited by ethidium, whereas more than 30% of the more weakly bound PCN resides in binding sites that are saturated at ethidium concentrations ≥10 μM. Although these results reveal eDNA binding sites for PYO and PCN, they also show fractions that are ethidium insensitive. This suggests there may be other binding sites for phenazines such as Pel-eDNA complexes, cell surfaces, filamentous phage or extracellular proteins. Regardless, the ability of ethidium to displace significant portions of PCN and PYO indicates that these phenazines intercalate into biofilm eDNA.
Confocal microscopy of WT and Δ phz ∗ colony biofilms with a cell-impermeable dsDNA dye, TOTO-1 ( Okshevsky and Meyer, 2014 55. Okshevsky, M. ∙ Meyer, R.L. Evaluation of fluorescent stains for visualizing extracellular DNA in biofilms J. Microbiol. Methods. 2014; 105 :102-104 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed abundant eDNA localized in dead cells and in between cells ( Figure S3 D). We quantified the bulk concentration of eDNA in colony biofilms by incubating biofilm suspensions with TOTO-1 and measuring dye fluorescence. Both WT and Δ phz ∗ biofilm suspensions yielded large fluorescence values when incubated with TOTO-1. These values fall within the range of 60–500 μM base pairs dsDNA in the colony biofilms, when calibrated against standards of calf thymus DNA ( Figure 2 E). However, adding calf thymus DNA to the biofilm suspensions did not yield the expected increase in dye fluorescence ( Figure S3 E), which suggests that the dye may be partially inhibited by biofilm components. Therefore, this order of magnitude estimate of biofilm eDNA should be interpreted as a lower bound on the true value. Given this estimate, the biofilm eDNA (>100 μM base pairs) is in excess of PYO (∼80 μM), but it may not be in excess of PCN (>300 μM). Due to its poor aqueous solubility, it is probable that PCN crystallizes extracellularly at the observed biofilm concentrations, which could lead to its measured retention ( Hernandez et al., 2004 32. Hernandez, M.E. ∙ Kappler, A. ∙ Newman, D.K. Phenazines and other redox-active antibiotics promote microbial mineral reduction Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70 :921-928 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, our in vivo and in vitro results are consistent with eDNA providing binding sites for oxidized PCN and oxidized PYO in the biofilm extracellular matrix.
Given that phenazines are differentially bound and retained in biofilm eDNA, we next sought to constrain how electron transfer might be achieved in this context. Previous research has shown distinct localization patterns for different phenazines within biofilms, with the lowest potential phenazines (e.g., PCA) in the interior, and the highest potential phenazine (e.g., PYO) at the oxic periphery ( Bellin et al., 2014 7. Bellin, D.L. ∙ Sakhtah, H. ∙ Rosenstein, J.K. ... Integrated circuit-based electrochemical sensor for spatially resolved detection of redox-active metabolites in biofilms Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3256 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 8. Bellin, D.L. ∙ Sakhtah, H. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Electrochemical camera chip for simultaneous imaging of multiple metabolites in biofilms Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10535 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether electron transfer could occur between these molecules in solution, we mixed different oxidized and reduced phenazines under anoxic conditions and monitored the absorbance spectra before and after mixing ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Because PYO exhibited the largest changes in absorbance upon reduction, we monitored different mixtures of PYO with PCA or PCN at 690 nm (unique PYO absorbance maximum) starting 1 min after mixing, at which point equilibrium had been achieved. Reactions proceeded as expected from the redox potentials of the phenazines, where PYO was almost completely reduced by the lower potential PCA and PCN, and reduction of PCA and PCN by the higher potential PYO was minimal ( Figures 3 B and S4 A). In addition to establishing that electron transfer can occur between different phenazines, given their similar structures, these results suggest that electron transfer between unbound (physically diffusing) like phenazines (e.g., PYO-PYO electron self-exchange) may also contribute to EET. Moreover, reactions between reduced PCA or PCN and oxidized PYO proceeded faster than oxidation of any of these phenazines by molecular oxygen ( Figure 3 C), because PYO red appeared in these reactions immediately upon the addition of PCA red or PCN red in the presence of O 2 , with subsequent oxidation of PYO red by O 2 proceeding more slowly. We next wondered whether the presence of DNA would affect the extent of PYO reduction. PCA or PCN fully reduce PYO in the presence of DNA ( Figure 3 B). Because PCA does not bind DNA, this result suggests electron transfer is occurring in solution between PCA in solution and unbound PYO. For PCN and PYO that both bind DNA, it is also possible that electron transfer is achieved by their unbound counterparts in solution. However, it has long been known that DNA can facilitate electron transfer between bound redox molecules ( Genereux and Barton, 2010 26. Genereux, J.C. ∙ Barton, J.K. Mechanisms for DNA charge transport Chem. Rev. 2010; 110 :1642-1662 Crossref Scopus (659) PubMed Google Scholar ), motivating us to test whether such a process could also occur within our P. aeruginosa biofilms.
DNA facilitates charge transfer through the π-stacked base pairs ( Genereux and Barton, 2010 26. Genereux, J.C. ∙ Barton, J.K. Mechanisms for DNA charge transport Chem. Rev. 2010; 110 :1642-1662 Crossref Scopus (659) PubMed Google Scholar ), and recent studies have shown that DNA charge transfer can occur over kilobase distances ( Tse et al., 2019 77. Tse, E.C.M. ∙ Zwang, T.J. ∙ Bedoya, S. ... Effective Distance for DNA-Mediated Charge Transport between Repair Proteins ACS Cent. Sci. 2019; 5 :65-72 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using single stranded DNA (ssDNA) modified electrodes and hybridizing complementary DNA, a previous study suggested that PYO might be able to participate in electron transfer via DNA ( Das et al., 2015 19. Das, T. ∙ Kutty, S.K. ∙ Tavallaie, R. ... Phenazine virulence factor binding to extracellular DNA is important for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :8398 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this specific method likely produces heterogeneous ssDNA/dsDNA monolayers, and the use of PYO in solution makes possible direct electron transfer between PYO and the electrode, confounding DNA charge transfer signals. To avoid background phenazine-electrode reactions, we revisited these experiments with a carefully controlled dsDNA modified electrode and a covalently tethered phenazine. Because it was not possible to directly synthesize a tethered PYO derivative, we tethered PCN, the other DNA binding phenazine, to a DNA strand (17 base pairs) through a flexible alkane linker (see STAR Methods ). We chose to work with the PCN-like tethered phenazine because it was the simplest synthetic route and nearest possible representation of a P. aeruginosa phenazine. To form dsDNA, the complementary strand containing a thiol linker (17 base oligo) was annealed to the PCN strand. The gold electrode was modified with the thiolated dsDNA according to standard protocols ( Kelley et al., 1997 41. Kelley, S.O. ∙ Barton, J.K. ∙ Jackson, N.M. ... Electrochemistry of methylene blue bound to a DNA-modified electrode Bioconjug. Chem. 1997; 8 :31-37 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ; Slinker et al., 2010 66. Slinker, J.D. ∙ Muren, N.B. ∙ Gorodetsky, A.A. ... Multiplexed DNA-modified electrodes J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 :2769-2774 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar , 2011 67. Slinker, J.D. ∙ Muren, N.B. ∙ Renfrew, S.E. ... DNA charge transport over 34 nm Nat. Chem. 2011; 3 :228-233 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ), yielding a packed DNA monolayer where the distal end of each dsDNA molecule contained a tethered PCN that can be either bound (intercalated within dsDNA) or unbound while covalently attached ( Figure 3 D).
The efficiency of DNA charge transfer depends upon the integrity of the π-stacking of base pairs within the dsDNA ( Genereux and Barton, 2010 26. Genereux, J.C. ∙ Barton, J.K. Mechanisms for DNA charge transport Chem. Rev. 2010; 110 :1642-1662 Crossref Scopus (659) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mismatched DNA base pairs stack less efficiently, but otherwise do not affect DNA structure, thus providing a convenient perturbation of DNA CT. Therefore, we used cyclic voltammetry to compare electron transfer between PCN and the electrode through well-matched dsDNA monolayers to dsDNAs containing a single base mismatch ( Figure 3 D). We utilized multiplexed DNA chips to facilitate replicate comparisons between well-matched and mismatched DNA monolayers ( Figures S4 B–S4D); measurements with a non-intercalating control probe showed that these different monolayers had very similar surface coverages ( Figures S4 E and S4F) ( Slinker et al., 2010 66. Slinker, J.D. ∙ Muren, N.B. ∙ Gorodetsky, A.A. ... Multiplexed DNA-modified electrodes J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 :2769-2774 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Figure 3 E shows that the mismatched construct yielded diminished current in the phenazine redox peak, consistent with the charge transfer being DNA-mediated; the presence of the intervening mismatch inhibits DNA charge transfer. This mismatch effect was consistent across replicate low density (32%–54% decrease) and high density (36%–69% decrease) DNA monolayers ( Figure S4 C; STAR Methods , “DNA modified electrode controls”). These results displayed mismatch attenuation similar to that observed for well-characterized small molecules shown to stack with the DNA duplex and carry out DNA-mediated charge transfer ( Slinker et al., 2011 67. Slinker, J.D. ∙ Muren, N.B. ∙ Renfrew, S.E. ... DNA charge transport over 34 nm Nat. Chem. 2011; 3 :228-233 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, in the presence of oxygen, a classic voltammetric signal characteristic of electrocatalysis was obtained ( Figure 3 F) centered on the phenazine redox peak. Hence, the DNA-tethered phenazine is able to accept electrons from the electrode through the DNA π-stack and then reduce oxygen in a catalytic fashion. Together, these results demonstrate that a P. aeruginosa phenazine can participate in DNA charge transfer in vitro .
To test if biofilm eDNA could support DNA charge transfer, we incubated Δ phz ∗ colony biofilms suspended in PBS with well-characterized intercalators that can perform DNA charge transfer reactions, which can be monitored by time-resolved spectroscopy ( Arkin et al., 1996b 4. Arkin, M.R. ∙ Stemp, E.D.A. ∙ Turro, C. ... Luminescence Quenching in Supramolecular Systems: A Comparison of DNA- and SDS Micelle-Mediated Photoinduced Electron Transfer between Metal Complexes J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 :2267-2274 Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar ). The quenching of photoexcited Ru(phen) 2 dppz 2+ by Rh(phi) 2 bpy 3+ is well-characterized and known to occur by a redox mechanism ( Stemp et al., 1995 71. Stemp, E.D.A. ∙ Arkin, M.R. ∙ Barton, J.K. Electron transfer between metallointercalators bound to DNA: Spectral identification of the transient intermediate J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117 :2375-2376 Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar ) and not energy transfer (e.g., fluorescence resonance energy transfer [FRET]), with both the forward and back electron transfers occurring predominantly on the picosecond timescale ( Figures 3 G and S4 G) ( Arkin et al., 1996a 3. Arkin, M.R. ∙ Stemp, E.D. ∙ Holmlin, R.E. ... Rates of DNA-mediated electron transfer between metallointercalators Science. 1996; 273 :475-480 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both of these intercalators bind to dsDNA more than an order of magnitude more tightly than do phenazines. Moreover, Ru(phen) 2 dppz 2+ is luminescent in aqueous solution when intercalated in dsDNA (or otherwise protected from water), precluding a 2 nd order reaction between the complexes in solution ( Friedman et al., 1990 25. Friedman, A.E. ∙ Chambron, J.C. ∙ Sauvage, J.P. ... A molecular light switch for DNA: Ru(bpy) 2 (dppz) 2+ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112 :4960-4962 Crossref Scopus (1367) Google Scholar ). Thus, in time-resolved emission experiments on the nanosecond timescale, static quenching, where quenching is fast and occurs without a change in Ru(phen) 2 dppz 2+ excited state lifetime, is consistent with DNA-mediated charge transfer ( Arkin et al., 1996b 4. Arkin, M.R. ∙ Stemp, E.D.A. ∙ Turro, C. ... Luminescence Quenching in Supramolecular Systems: A Comparison of DNA- and SDS Micelle-Mediated Photoinduced Electron Transfer between Metal Complexes J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 :2267-2274 Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar ), while slower dynamic quenching, which leads to a change in emission lifetime, is consistent with a slower diffusive process. We first compared the Ru(phen) 2 dppz 2+ signals of liquid grown and biofilm suspensions (of the same optical density) to determine if the signal was specific to eDNA; the ruthenium complex is not expected to be taken up by the cells and bind to genomic DNA on the timescale of this experiment ( Figure 3 H). We only observed ruthenium luminescence in the presence of the biofilm suspension, consistent with ruthenium luminescence being associated with binding to eDNA. We then examined the pattern of quenching of Ru(phen) 2 dppz 2+ luminescence by Rh(phi) 2 bpy 3+ . Figure 3 I shows static quenching where the intensity of the Ru(phen) 2 dppz 2+ signal decreases, while the observed decay kinetics are unchanged ( Figure S4 H). Therefore, we conclude that biofilm eDNA can support rapid DNA charge transfer between these two metal complexes faster than the timescale for diffusion.
Having investigated phenazine retention and electron transfer separately, we next wanted to establish a system in which we could monitor both of these processes simultaneously in vivo . We took an electrochemical approach to achieve this, growing P. aeruginosa biofilms on interdigitated microelectrode electrode arrays (IDA) ( Figure 4 A). Biofilms were grown by incubating IDAs in bioelectrochemical reactors with planktonic cultures under oxic conditions and stirring ( Figure 4 B). After 4 days, with medium replaced daily, mature biofilms were transferred to anoxic reactors with fresh medium for electrochemical measurements. Confocal and SEM imaging revealed that the IDA biofilms were heterogeneous in composition, but consistently contained multicellular structures of live cells and abundant eDNA ( Figures 4 C–4E, S5 A, and S5B). Under these conditions, the cells predominately produced PYO (and some PCA), as measured by LC-MS ( Figure S5 C). Because PYO was the most tightly binding phenazine in colony biofilms and in vitro , we focused on this phenazine for the remainder of these experiments.
Originally used to measure conductivity of abiotic materials, the IDA has a 2-working electrode geometry and recently was adapted to study EET through microbial biofilms ( Xu et al., 2018 86. Xu, S. ∙ Barrozo, A. ∙ Tender, L.M. ... Multiheme Cytochrome Mediated Redox Conduction through Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 Cells J. Am. Chem.

(Editors) Biofilms in Bioelectrochemical Systems John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2015 Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar ; Snider et al., 2012 68. Snider, R.M. ∙ Strycharz-Glaven, S.M. ∙ Tsoi, S.D. ... Long-range electron transport in Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms is redox gradient-driven Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :15467-15472 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). Measurements are made by driving electron transfer between the two electrode bands across a 5 μm gap ( Figure 4 F), resulting in EET that is decoupled from the cells’ metabolic activity. Specifically, we used a generator-collector (GC) strategy to measure EET through the biofilm, where the “generator” electrode is swept from an oxidizing potential (E = 0 mV versus Ag/AgCl) to a reducing potential (E = −500 mV), while the “collector” electrode maintains a fixed oxidizing potential (E = 0 mV). In this GC arrangement, electron transfer into the biofilm from the generator occurs as the potential of the generator is swept negatively, reducing PYO (E 1/2 = −250 mV) at the biofilm/generator interface. Electrons are conducted across the gap through the biofilm due to EET, either by physical diffusion of PYO or other mechanisms. The electron transfer at both the generator and collector is measured as current (I gc ) and plotted against the potential of the generator electrode. Implicit in generating a sustained I gc is recycling of the redox molecules supporting current. Figure 4 G shows that WT and Δ phz + PYO biofilms supported current (above background) across the 5-μm gap over a ∼3 min scan as the generator potential approached PYO’s redox potential (−250 mV versus Ag/AgCl), consistent with PYO-mediated EET; significantly, Δ phz alone did not. Dependency of current on the generator potential observed here is consistent with PYO-mediated EET being a diffusive process. Reduction of PYO at the generator and oxidation of PYO at the collector generates a redox gradient that drives EET through the intervening biofilm, resulting in current centered on the PYO midpoint potential that saturates at strongly reducing generator potentials ( Snider et al., 2012 68. Snider, R.M. ∙ Strycharz-Glaven, S.M. ∙ Tsoi, S.D. ... Long-range electron transport in Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms is redox gradient-driven Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :15467-15472 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, the diffusive nature of EET would reflect either physical diffusion of PYO through the biofilm (reduced PYO from the generator to collector, oxidized PYO from the collector to the generator) or the effective diffusion of electrons through bound PYO ( Strycharz-Glaven et al., 2011 74. Strycharz-Glaven, S.M. ∙ Snider, R.M. ∙ Guiseppi-Elie, A. ... On the electrical conductivity of microbial nanowires and biofilms Energy Environ. Sci. 2011; 4 :4366 Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar ).
To test whether these short-term GC measurements of biofilm EET indicate long-term ability to support metabolic activity, we poised the IDA electrodes at an oxidizing potential (+100 mV versus Ag/AgCl) and monitored the current produced by the biofilm over 4 days in the presence of 40 mM succinate as the electron donor for cellular metabolism under anoxic conditions. In this configuration, the observed current would be due to cellular oxidation of succinate coupled with PYO-catalyzed EET to the poised electrode, where the electrode acts as the terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen ( Figure 4 H). Figure 4 I shows that both WT biofilms relying solely on endogenous PYO and Δ phz biofilms + exogenous PYO generate robust current over many days, whereas Δ phz alone does not. The daily periodic rise in current likely reflects the impact of slight temperature or light fluctuations in the room on the cells’ metabolic activity over the course of the experiment ( Kahl et al., 2016 38. Kahl, L.J. ∙ Morales, D. ∙ Dietrich, L. Light- and Temperature-Controlled Redox Cycling in Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Biofilms Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2016; 100 :S185 Crossref Google Scholar , 2019 39. Kahl, L.J. ∙ Price-Whelan, A. ∙ Dietrich, L.E.P. Light-mediated decreases in cyclic di-GMP levels are potentiated by pyocyanin and inhibit structure formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Differences in current magnitude between the WT and Δ phz + PYO runs are likely due to stochastic differences in PYO abundance in the biofilms and/or efficiency of cellular PYO reduction. Together, these results demonstrate that the IDA biofilms can use retained PYO for EET to support metabolic activity. Although we focus on phenazine-mediated EET, the small current observed for Δ phz biofilms could indicate that there are also phenazine-independent mechanisms of EET perhaps mediated by conductive pili, flagella, or other metabolites ( Maruthupandy et al., 2015 49. Maruthupandy, M. ∙ Anand, M. ∙ Maduraiveeran, G. ... Electrical conductivity measurements of bacterial nanowires from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Adv. Nat. Sci.-Nanosci. 2015; 6 :045007 Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2019 45. Liu, X. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ Xu, A. ... Biological synthesis of high-conductive pili in aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2019; 103 :1535-1544 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine whether our IDA biofilms retained phenazines in the same manner as colony biofilms, Δ phz ∗ IDA biofilms were soaked in PYO in one reactor and then transferred to another reactor with fresh medium lacking PYO ( Figure 5 A). Comparing GC scans of a biofilm in the soak and transfer reactors showed that PYO was clearly retained on this timescale and supported biofilm conductivity ( Figure 5 B). In contrast, GC scans of a Δ phz ∗ biofilm soaked in PCA showed a signal that became immediately undetectable in the transfer reactor ( Figure 5 C). Therefore, PCA rapidly diffused out of the biofilm, as expected because it does not bind DNA. The equilibration of PYO (from the IDA biofilm) with the fresh medium was monitored in more detail by square wave voltammetry (SWV) ( Figure 5 D), for which peak current (I swv ) is proportional to the concentration of the PYO remaining in the biofilm at each time interval ( Bard et al., 1980 6. Bard, A.J. ∙ Faulkner, L.R. ∙ Leddy, J. ... Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications Wiley, 1980 Google Scholar ). Thus, the rate of decay of I swv provides a means to assess the loss rate of PYO from the biofilm, a measure of how long PYO is retained. Upon transfer, the biofilm PYO peak current (I swv ) decays in 30–45 min, whereas for a blank IDA (no biofilm) dipped in PYO, I swv decays in 2–3 min ( Figure 5 G). Thus, like colony biofilms, IDA biofilms appear to retain PYO but not PCA, and use retained PYO for phenazine EET metabolism in vivo .
Next, we sought to understand the efficiency of PYO-mediated EET in the biofilm. We reasoned that a determination of “efficiency” would compare the rate of electron transfer (that supports the metabolism of the O 2 limited cells) to the loss rate of PYO from the biofilm (that limits the utility of each PYO molecule). These two processes can both be described by diffusion coefficients, so in a single electrochemical experiment, we measured the apparent diffusion coefficient for the PYO-mediated EET, D ap , which characterizes all of the redox processes with the electrode, and the diffusion coefficient for PYO as it is lost from the biofilm, D loss .
We determined D ap for EET by PYO in an IDA Δ phz ∗ biofilm to avoid confounding PYO retention with production, although WT biofilms with endogenous PYO yielded similar results ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Each Δ phz ∗ biofilm was soaked with PYO in one reactor then transferred to a second reactor lacking PYO ( Figure 5 A), and the equilibration of the biofilm PYO into the fresh medium was monitored by paired SWV and GC measurements over time ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Noting that I swv is proportional to 𝐶 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 , where C is the effective PYO concentration ( Bard et al., 1980 6. Bard, A.J. ∙ Faulkner, L.R. ∙ Leddy, J. ... Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications Wiley, 1980 Google Scholar ), whereas I gc is proportional to 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ( Strycharz-Glaven et al., 2011 74. Strycharz-Glaven, S.M. ∙ Snider, R.M. ∙ Guiseppi-Elie, A. ... On the electrical conductivity of microbial nanowires and biofilms Energy Environ. Sci. 2011; 4 :4366 Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar ), plotting I gc versus I swv for each time point is expected to yield a linear dependency with a slope ( m ) proportional to √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ( Figure 5 F) when D ap is independent of the concentration of PYO in the biofilm ( Akhoury et al., 2013 1. Akhoury, A. ∙ Bromberg, L. ∙ Hatton, T.A. Interplay of electron hopping and bounded diffusion during charge transport in redox polymer electrodes J. Phys. Chem. B. 2013; 117 :333-342 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; White et al., 1982 83. White, H.S. ∙ Leddy, J. ∙ Bard, A.J. Polymer films on electrodes. 8. Investigation of charge-transport mechanisms in Nafion polymer modified electrodes J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104 :4811-4817 Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar ). In this manner, it is possible to measure D ap for PYO remaining in the biofilm at any given instance when its concentration is unknown.
Applying this approach, for two biological replicates of Δ phz ∗ biofilms (three technical replicates each), we found that the mean D ap for PYO is 6.4 × 10 −6 cm 2 /s over a wide range of PYO biofilm concentrations ( Figures 5 H and S6 C). To validate our approach, we measured D ap using a blank IDA with no biofilm, only solution PYO for which we expect D ap ≈D loss . Using known PYO concentrations with a blank IDA (no biofilm) we obtained nearly identical estimates (D ap ≈6.8 × 10 −6 cm 2 /s) using our I gc versus I swv method (concentration unknown) or established methods (I gc versus [PYO] and I swv versus [PYO]) that depend on known concentrations ( Figures 5 H and S6 D–S6G; STAR Methods section D ap measurement theory) ( Bard et al., 1980 6. Bard, A.J. ∙ Faulkner, L.R. ∙ Leddy, J. ... Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications Wiley, 1980 Google Scholar ). We further validated our measurement scheme by comparing it to an established chronocoulometry technique with two other redox molecules (hexammineruthenium(III) and ferrocenemethanol) in the presence and absence of the polymer Nafion. In all cases, estimates of D ap by the two methods were within ∼2× ( Figure S6 H).
To estimate the upper limit for D loss of PYO lost from P. aeruginosa biofilms, we applied a semi-infinite one-dimensional diffusion model ( STAR Methods , D loss measurement theory) to fit the decay of the same I swv measurements used above ( Figures 5 D and 5G). Although each SWV scan depends on D ap , the decay process of I swv results from loss of PYO out of the biofilm (D loss ). This calculation requires a scan time constant, whose value we constrain by using the blank control where we assume D ap = D loss , allowing us to solve for this constant ( Figure S7 A; STAR Methods , section D loss model assumptions). For Δ phz ∗ biofilms, this diffusion model yields a mean D loss of 2.0 × 10 −7 cm 2 /s ( Figure S7 B). Hence, D ap for PYO-mediated biofilm EET is more than 25-fold higher than D loss ( Figure 5 H). Although this model simplifies the actual physical system, it provides a means to estimate an upper limit for the rate of PYO loss from the biofilm. Such a low D loss is consistent with the relatively long time it takes for I swv to decay when transferred to fresh medium for PYO in a biofilm (∼45 min) compared to PYO for a blank IDA (<2 min) ( Figure 5 G) or to PCA in a biofilm (<1 min) ( Figure 5 C). Moreover, the conservative assumptions of our model make it likely that we have underestimated the true difference between D loss and D ap in the biofilm. Collectively, these observations support the idea that PYO EET occurs rapidly compared to the loss of PYO diffusing out of the IDA biofilms.

Section: Discussion

The redox activity of phenazine metabolites produced by P. aeruginosa has intrigued researchers since the 1930s ( Friedheim, 1934 24. Friedheim, E.A. The effect of pyocyanine on the respiration of some normal tissues and tumours Biochem. J. 1934; 28 :173-179 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and over the last 20 years a model has emerged that links phenazine electron transfer to biofilm metabolism ( Hernandez and Newman, 2001 31. Hernandez, M.E. ∙ Newman, D.K. Extracellular electron transfer Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58 :1562-1571 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jo et al., 2017 37.

Bacteriol. 2013; 195 :1371-1380 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the well-characterized P. aeruginosa -phenazine system as a model for studying EET mediated by extracellular electron shuttles, here we addressed the conundrum of how phenazines complete their redox cycle within the biofilm matrix without being lost to the environment. Our results point to eDNA as being a critical component of the matrix that facilitates phenazine retention and redox cycling for EET.
Quantifying phenazine retention in a simple biofilm system was our first goal. Although past work has measured phenazines in culture supernatants and in agar underlying colony biofilms ( Bellin et al., 2014 7. Bellin, D.L. ∙ Sakhtah, H. ∙ Rosenstein, J.K. ... Integrated circuit-based electrochemical sensor for spatially resolved detection of redox-active metabolites in biofilms Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3256 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 8. Bellin, D.L. ∙ Sakhtah, H. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Electrochemical camera chip for simultaneous imaging of multiple metabolites in biofilms Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10535 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dietrich et al., 2006 20. Dietrich, L.E.P. ∙ Price-Whelan, A. ∙ Petersen, A. ... The phenazine pyocyanin is a terminal signalling factor in the quorum sensing network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61 :1308-1321 Crossref Scopus (574) PubMed Google Scholar ), phenazine concentrations within any type of biofilm system were unknown. We found that the degree of retention varied dramatically between the three studied phenazines in colony biofilms, with PCN and PYO being strongly enriched in the biofilm, in contrast to PCA, which readily diffuses away ( Figure 1 ). Further, only PYO complemented the wrinkled morphology of the Δphz ∗ mutant, showing that this retained PYO is used for phenazine EET to support anoxic biofilm metabolism in vivo ( Figure S1 A). We observed a similar trend for biofilms grown in liquid medium attaching to IDAs, where PCA was not retained, but PYO was retained and supported biofilm conductivity and metabolism in vivo ( Figures 4 and 5 ).
Notably, oxidized PCN and PYO bind ds DNA in vitro , and perturbing extracellular DNA binding sites disrupted PYO retention (and PCN to a lesser extent) in vivo ( Figure 2 ). Previous studies have shown PYO actually promotes eDNA release via cell lysis ( Das and Manefield, 2012 17. Das, T. ∙ Manefield, M. Pyocyanin promotes extracellular DNA release in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e46718 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meirelles and Newman, 2018 51. Meirelles, L.A. ∙ Newman, D.K. Both toxic and beneficial effects of pyocyanin contribute to the lifecycle of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 110 :995-1010 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), so PYO retention by eDNA suggests a connection between eDNA production and utilization. Although certain enzymes and cytochromes are known to bind extracellular polysaccharides ( Tielen et al., 2013 76. Tielen, P. ∙ Kuhn, H. ∙ Rosenau, F. ... Interaction between extracellular lipase LipA and the polysaccharide alginate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa BMC Microbiol. 2013; 13 :159 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rollefson et al., 2011 62. Rollefson, J.B. ∙ Stephen, C.S. ∙ Tien, M. ... Identification of an extracellular polysaccharide network essential for cytochrome anchoring and biofilm formation in Geobacter sulfurreducens J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193 :1023-1033 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ), to our knowledge, PYO retention in eDNA is the first example of an electron shuttling small molecule being bound by the extracellular matrix of a biofilm. Moreover, that such binding underpins PYO-mediated biofilm EET is an important new result. Because eDNA is found in biofilms made by diverse species and many small molecules exhibit DNA binding capacity, our results may be broadly relevant to diverse biofilm functions involving extracellular metabolites.
Recognizing that a primary function for phenazines is extracellular electron transfer, we characterized this process in vivo . Our IDA experiments suggest that PYO simultaneously can be retained (low D loss ) and facilitate fast EET (high D ap ), establishing the efficiency of this process ( Figure 5 ). To understand the mechanism that underpins this efficient EET, we can interpret our results in the context of electron transfer theory from the study of redox polymers ( Dalton et al., 1990 18. Dalton, E.F. ∙ Surridge, N.A. ∙ Jernigan, J.C. ... Charge transport in electroactive polymers consisting of fixed molecular redox sites Chemical Physics. 1990; 141 :143-157 Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar ). This theory holds that the measured D ap is the sum of the effective diffusion coefficient of electrons due to self-exchange reactions among bound shuttles (D e ) and the physical diffusion coefficient (D phys ) of any unbound shuttles (D ap = D e + D phys ). In this context, we can explain our electrochemical results that biofilm PYO D ap (∼6.4 × 10 −6 cm 2 /s) is higher than biofilm PYO D loss (∼2.0 × 10 −7 cm 2 /s), and similar to the blank IDA (solution PYO) D values (∼6.8 × 10 −6 cm 2 /s) in two ways ( Figure 5 H). First, if we assume our measured D loss is the same as PYO D phys within the biofilm, the difference between D ap and D phys can be explained by D e . Our in vitro data suggest that such self-exchange reactions (D e ) could be DNA-mediated. In the case of very rapid electron transfer among eDNA-bound PYO, D ap would still be limited by counter ion diffusion, consistent with a measured D ap similar to that of a small molecule in solution (∼7 × 10 −6 cm 2 /s) ( White et al., 1982 83. White, H.S. ∙ Leddy, J. ∙ Bard, A.J. Polymer films on electrodes. 8. Investigation of charge-transport mechanisms in Nafion polymer modified electrodes J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104 :4811-4817 Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar ). Alternatively, the measured loss of PYO from the biofilm, D loss , may not accurately reflect physical diffusion of PYO within the biofilm, D phys . Because the IDA biofilms do not completely cover the electrodes, PYO may be able to physically diffuse in solution adjacent to them. In this case, diffusion in solution would be consistent with the measured D ap , and the low D loss measurement would reflect the slow release of PYO from the IDA biofilm due to its retention by eDNA. Regardless, the striking measured difference between D ap and D loss indicates that PYO electron transfer promotes efficient biofilm EET metabolism because electron transfer occurs rapidly, while loss of PYO to the environment is slow due to its retention by eDNA.
Together, our results allow us to refine our model for how phenazine EET may operate within biofilms ( Figure 6 ). Intriguingly, PYO biosynthesis requires O 2 , whereas PCN and PCA do not, and electrochemical imaging underneath colony biofilms has shown lower potential phenazines in the anoxic interior (PCA and PCN) and the higher potential phenazine (PYO) near the oxic periphery ( Bellin et al., 2014 7. Bellin, D.L. ∙ Sakhtah, H. ∙ Rosenstein, J.K. ... Integrated circuit-based electrochemical sensor for spatially resolved detection of redox-active metabolites in biofilms Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3256 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 8. Bellin, D.L. ∙ Sakhtah, H. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Electrochemical camera chip for simultaneous imaging of multiple metabolites in biofilms Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10535 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reduced PYO is also known to react with oxygen significantly faster than PCA and PCN ( Wang and Newman, 2008 79. Wang, Y. ∙ Newman, D.K. Redox reactions of phenazine antibiotics with ferric (hydr)oxides and molecular oxygen Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008; 42 :2380-2386 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, it is tempting to speculate that phenazines are ordered in the biofilm matrix in a sequence akin to a large extracellular electron transport chain—from reduced PCA/PCN in the anoxic interior, to eDNA bound PYO at the oxic periphery, and ultimately to molecular oxygen ( Figure 6 A). How might phenazines exchange electrons within this framework? Noting that the heterogeneity of the biofilm matrix makes it possible that different electron transfer pathways could occur in these complex systems, we favor two mechanisms mediated by eDNA for how phenazine EET may operate in the matrix ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Both mechanisms assume that reduced PCA and PCN will diffuse from the anoxic zone to the oxic zone (i), where PYO ox is bound to eDNA. In one model ( Figure 6 B), PYO’s binding equilibrium will result in some PYO ox unbinding from the eDNA, allowing it to react with PCA red or PCN red (ii). PYO red then reacts with oxygen generating PYO ox (iii), which rebinds DNA. In the other model ( Figure 6 C), reduced phenazines (likely PCN) intercalate into eDNA and reduce PYO ox via DNA charge transfer (ii). PYO red unbinds DNA, reacts with oxygen (iii), and PYO ox rebinds DNA. Given that PCA red and PCN red react more quickly with PYO ox than O 2 , then both models would facilitate the reoxidation of the interior phenazines and promote diffusion back toward the anoxic interior (iv). These models integrate what is known about phenazine O 2 reactivities, redox potentials and biosynthesis zones, and help explain how PYO and eDNA interactions enhance EET in P. aeruginosa biofilms by facilitating retention and electron transfer. Testing these models in physiochemically well-defined synthetic matrixes in addition to complex biofilms represents an exciting challenge for future research.
In conclusion, our findings illustrate how eDNA may provide a mechanism to resolve how otherwise diffusible extracellular electron shuttles can catalyze efficient EET in real world, open systems. Beyond serving as a structural support, carbon source, or genetic reservoir, our studies reveal that interactions between extracellular electron shuttles and eDNA in biofilms underpin their metabolic vitality. It is noteworthy that eDNA is abundant in many biofilms ( Flemming and Wingender, 2010 23. Flemming, H.-C. ∙ Wingender, J. The biofilm matrix Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :623-633 Crossref Scopus (6951) PubMed Google Scholar ) and diverse biofilm-forming bacteria have the potential to produce extracellular electron shuttles ( Glasser et al., 2017a 28. Glasser, N.R. ∙ Saunders, S.H. ∙ Newman, D.K. The colorful world of extracellular electron shuttles Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 71 :731-751 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, eDNA retention of these electron shuttles—and perhaps of other biologically useful molecules—may represent a widespread strategy whereby a reactive extracellular matrix supports bacterial biofilms in unexpected and physiologically significant ways.

All Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 strains were plated on LB agar from −80°C glycerol stocks and grown overnight at 37°C. Plates were stored at −4°C for up to a week and were used to inoculate liquid cultures. Unless otherwise noted, liquid cultures were grown in 3 mL of LB medium in glass culture tubes (VWR #47729-583) in an orbital shaker (New Brunswick, Innova 44) at 37°C shaking at 250 rpm. Colony biofilms were grown on 1% tryptone (BD #211705), 1% agar (BD #214010) in 6-well plates (Fisher Scientific #08-772-49) at room temperature (∼22°C) in the dark for 3 to 4 days. IDA biofilms were grown in a minimal medium (MM) with succinate as the carbon source (14.15 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 38.85 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 42.8 mM NaCl, 9.3 mM NH 4 Cl, 40 mM Na-succinate, adjusted to pH 7.2 and autoclaved then 1x SL-10 trace element solution ( Atlas, 2004 5. Atlas, R. Handbook of Microbiological Media CRC Press, 2004 Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar ) and 1 mM MgSO 4 ). From a stationary phase 3 mL MM liquid culture, the bioelectrochemical reactors with 180 mL MM were inoculated to an OD 500 of 0.005. The medium was exchanged every 24 hours, and biofilms were grown on the IDA for 3 or 4 days in this fashion. During growth, constant temperature was maintained at ∼31°C, reactors were stirred at 250 rpm (VWR #58948-138) and air was bubbled into two reactors at a time with a small aquarium bubbler (Tetra #77851).
Chemicals were obtained from commercial sources (Sigma Aldrich, Fisher Scientific, VWR, and New England Biolabs) and used without further purification unless otherwise specified. All solutions were made with Milli-Q water (> 18 MΩ cm). Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) used for resuspending cells or contacting biofilms (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM PO 4 (1.44 g / L Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.24 g / L KH 2 PO 4 ), 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.2) was different than PBS used for chemical stocks and in vitro assays (10 mM PO 4 (0.952 g/L Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.592 g/L NaH 2 PO 4 ), 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0).
PCA was synthesized by Dr. Stuart Conway’s Lab and was a gift. PCN was obtained from Princeton Biochem (#PBMR030086). PYO was synthesized by shining light on phenazine methosulfate (VWR #AAH56718-06) and purified with repeated organic (dichloromethane) and acid (HCl) extractions as described previously ( Costa et al., 2017 15. Costa, K.C. ∙ Glasser, N.R. ∙ Conway, S.J. ... Pyocyanin degradation by a tautomerizing demethylase inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms Science. 2017; 355 :170-173 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). PYO was further purified by reverse phase HPLC or repeated hexane precipitations. Stocks of PYO were either made in PBS (pH 7.0) to 1 mM or in 20 mM HCl to 10 mM and quantified by absorbance at 690 nm with the extinction coefficient ε 690 = 4306 M −1 cm −1 . Stocks of PCA were made in PBS to 1-2 mM or in 10 mM NaOH to 10 mM. Stocks of PCN were made in DMSO to 20 mM.
Colony biofilms were grown on 1% tryptone (BD #211705), 1% agar (BD #214010) in 6-well plates (Fisher Scientific #08-772-49) at room temperature (∼22°C) in the dark for 3 to 4 days. The medium was autoclaved and cooled to 60°C, then in a biosafety cabinet (The Baker Company #SG603A-HE) 5 mL of molten agar was transferred into each well of the 6-well plate and left to solidify for 60 min with no lid and constant airflow. When phenazines were added to the medium, concentrated stocks were added first, then the medium, and then the wells were stirred with sterile pipettes until uniform. Membrane filters (Sigma-Aldrich # WHA110606) were gently placed shiny side down onto the center of each agar well, and colonies were inoculated by pipetting 10 μL of stationary phase culture (from LB liquid) onto the center of the membranes.
For DNase treated biofilms, after 3 days of growth membranes/biofilms were transferred to fresh agar wells containing 20 L of DNase 1 (2 Kunitz units / μL) (Sigma-Aldrich #D4263) spotted directly underneath the biofilm. Biofilms then grew for another 24 hr. DNase was prepared in NEB Buffer 4 or water.
All colony biofilms were imaged in the 6 well plates at 20x zoom with a Keyence digital microscope (VHX-600) before extraction. Colonies were stained for confocal imaging by growing them with 1 μM TOTO-1 and 10 μM Syto60 in the underlying agar. Biofilms on their membranes were transferred to imaging dishes. High magnification images were taken by gently dropping coverslips (#1.5) onto the top surface of the colony and imaging through the coverslip with an upright confocal microscope, as described below (IDA biofilms – Fluorescence imaging). Colony biofilms on membranes were fixed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by floating the membrane on a paraformaldehyde solution and then submerging. Upon submersion, the colony came off of the membrane mostly intact, leaving only a thin layer of cells fixed to the membrane. See SEM imaging section below for further details.
Membranes, with the colony biofilms stably attached, were lifted off the agar with fine tweezers and carefully placed in microfuge tubes containing 800 μL or 1 mL of PBS. For colonies that were smaller in diameter than the microfuge tube, the membrane was placed upside down directly on top of the open tube, so that the colony sat above the PBS hanging from the membrane. Then, the colony was gently pushed down into the tube, by pushing with tweezers from the center. If the colony diameter was greater than the tube the membrane/biofilm was carefully held with the tweezers and allowed to flop over. While the membrane/biofilm was curved over it was gently threaded into the tube. If any part of the colony touched the rim of the tube, the tweezers were used to scrape as much as possible into the inside.
Once the membrane/biofilm was in the tube, each tube was vortexed (Fisher Scientific #12-812) at maximum speed for 1 min, after which the vast majority of the biofilm was resuspended in the liquid and no longer associated with the membrane. The membrane was removed from each tube with tweezers. The biofilm suspension was then centrifuged (Eppendorf #5418) at 6000 r cf. for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and immediately prepared for LC-MS or frozen at −20°C. This process was done for many biofilms at once, so biofilms typically sat for 30-60 min in PBS from the time the membrane was first added to the time the samples were centrifuged.
Biofilm volumes were estimated by comparing biofilm suspension volumes to controls that only had bare membranes added and removed. Volumes were measured with a p200 pipette. Significant variation was observed in volume measurements of replicate biofilms that looked identical, so the mean WT colony volume of 60μL was used to normalize all colony measurements, although there are likely subtle volume differences between the differently treated colonies/strains.
The 6-well agar plates were extracted, by adding 2 or 3 mL of PBS to the 5 mL of agar. The agar was scarred with a pipette tip to facilitate agar/liquid exchange. The 6 well plates were left on an orbital shaker at 250 rpm (Ika #KS-260) for 6 hours, which was determined to be optimal. Then, 1 mL of the liquid from each well was transferred to a microfuge tube and processed for LC-MS or frozen at −20°C.
For the sonication experiment, resuspended biofilms were treated for 1 min on ice (Fisher Scientific, Sonic Dismembrator 550), then processed normally. CFU counts showed that > 65% of cells died. For the no-membrane experiment, 3 mL of PBS were added directly to the wells containing the biofilm. The biofilm was quickly resuspended in the liquid using a cell scraper and 1mL of liquid was saved, while the rest was removed. Then the agar was extracted as normal.
Samples were filtered with 0.2 μm spin filters (Corning #8160) and transferred to sample vials (Waters #600000668CV) and loaded into the autosampler at 10°C. Samples were run on a Waters LC-MS system (Waters e2695 Separations Module, 2998 PDA Detector, QDA Detector). 10μL of each sample was injected onto a reverse phase C-18 column (XBridge #186006035) running a gradient of 98% H 2 O + 0.04% NH 4 OH to 68% acetonitrile + 0.04% NH 4 OH over 11 min (run times were 20min total) with 2% methanol throughout. UV-Vis and positive MS scans were acquired for each run. PCA, PCN, and PYO were distinguished by retention time (∼3 min, 6 min and 8.85 min respectively), detected at 364 nm (PCA and PCN) or 313 nm (PYO), and manually verified by examining masses 225.2 (PCA), 224.2 (PCN) and 210.24 (PYO). Peaks were automatically identified in the UV-Vis channels by retention time, quantified using the apex track algorithm, converted to concentrations using standard curves (> 6 points from 100 nM to 100 μM), and then exported as text files from the Empower software.
Resuspended colony biofilms were assayed for eDNA by measuring TOTO-1 fluorescence on a Tecan Spark 10M plate reader in black 96 well plates. Wells were prepared with 65 μL PBS and 10 μL of TOTO-1 (10 μM stock, 1 μM final) and 25 μL of biofilm suspension or calf thymus DNA was added to each well and gently mixed by pipetting. TOTO-1 fluorescence was monitored with 480 nm excitation and 535 nm emission after ∼20 minutes of incubation at room temperature. Colony biofilms were measured with six biological replicates and technical triplicates. A standard curve was obtained by diluting a stock of calf thymus DNA twofold serially, yielding measurements from 500 μg / mL to 7 ng / mL.
Phenazine stocks were made in PBS (pH 7.0 10 mM PO 4 , 50 mM NaCl) to 1 mM (PCA, PYO) or 500 μM (PCN with 5% DMSO). All assays were performed in the same PBS buffer unless otherwise noted. Complementary 29 base pair oligos from IDT were annealed (cooled incrementally over 1 hour following denaturation) to form the ds DNA for ITC and the ethidium displacement assays (see Key Resources Table for sequences). Ds DNA for MST was prepared by PCR amplifying an 80 base pair region from P. aeruginosa genomic DNA using the primers listed in the Key Resources Table . One of the primers contained a Cy3 fluorophore for the MST readout.
ITC was performed with a MicroCal ITC200 (Malvern). Phenazine stocks were loaded directly into the ITC syringe. The cell was loaded with 10 to 50 μM ds DNA in PBS (or PBS + 5% DMSO for PCN). Results shown are representative of replicates taken at various ds DNA concentrations. Thermograms were recorded at 21°C with stirring at 300 rpm and reference power 2. There were 13 injections of 3.2 μL volume spaced by 240 s with 600 s of settle time.
Thermograms were integrated and baseline corrected in the Origin software. Peak integrations were then loaded into the GUI version of pytc ( Duvvuri et al., 2018 22. Duvvuri, H. ∙ Wheeler, L.C. ∙ Harms, M.J. pytc: Open-Source Python Software for Global Analyses of Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Data Biochemistry. 2018; 57 :2578-2583 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the default 0.1 units of uncertainty added to each measurement. Binding curves were plotted with the molar ratio phenazine / oligomer. The data were fit with the Bayesian model and parameter estimates with confidence intervals were generated. The K value was converted to a dissociation constant by taking the inverse and converted from the oligomer concentration to base-pair concentration by multiplying by 29 base pair / fraction competent (f_x = 1.6 for PYO and 1.3 for PCN).
In black 96 well plates (Nunc #237105) 5 μM ethidium bromide (EtBr) was prepared in wells with increasing concentrations of PCA, PCN, or PYO. Fluorescence readings were taken on a Tecan Spark 10M plate reader with excitation 480 nm and emission 600 nm. Then a small volume of 29 base pair ds DNA (prepared the same as for ITC) was added to a final concentration of 1 μM. The plates were mixed with rotary shaking and incubated at room temperature for at least 5 min protected from light. Then fluorescence was read again, and the bound ethidium signal was calculated by subtracting the pre-DNA reading from the post-DNA reading. IC 50 was calculated by fitting the data to the hill equation. IC 50 was converted into K i with the equation K i = IC 50 / (1 + [EtBr] / K d ), using an empirical K d for ethidium (under the same conditions) of 1 μM.
Microscale thermophoresis was performed with a NanoTemper Monolith instrument following the manufacturer’s protocol (capillaries - NanoTemper #MO-K022). Briefly, capillary solutions were prepared with 50 nM ds DNA and two-fold dilutions of phenazines starting at concentrations greater than or equal to 1mM. Thermophoresis was performed at an ambient temperature of 22.5°C, with the thermorphoresis laser power 40% and the fluorescence excitation laser at 20% power. Thermophoresis was recorded for 30 s and evaluated using the T-jump strategy. Fluorescence peak shapes along the x axis of each capillary were very uniform and peak intensity did not vary meaningfully between phenazine concentrations. K d was calculated by fitting the quantified data to a hill equation. Results shown are representative of multiple MST runs with varied settings.
The endogenous fluorescence of reduced phenazines was measured with different concentrations of calf thymus DNA with a BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader placed in an anaerobic chamber. Reduced phenazines (100 μM solutions) were prepared by bulk electrolysis of oxidized phenazine solutions in electrochemical chambers described previously ( Wang et al., 2010 80. Wang, Y. ∙ Kern, S.E. ∙ Newman, D.K. Endogenous phenazine antibiotics promote anaerobic survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via extracellular electron transfer J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192 :365-369 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). The solutions were transferred into stoppered serum bottles and moved to the anaerobic chamber containing the plate reader. 135 μL reduced phenazine was incubated with 15 μL PBS containing different amounts of calf thymus DNA, thus each well contained 90 μM phenazine. Fluorescence was monitored in a black 96 well plate with filter cubes to control excitation and emission wavelengths. PYO was excited using a 360 nm light and emission was monitored at 460 nm. For PCA and PCN excitation was at 485 nm and emission was at 528 nm.
Electron transfer reactions between phenazines under anoxic conditions were monitored in the anaerobic plate reader described above. Reduced phenazines (described above) were mixed with oxidized phenazines (67.5 μL each) and 15 μL PBS with or without DNA (2 mg / mL) to yield mixtures containing 45 μM of each phenazine. Reactions in clear bottom, black walled 96 well plates were measured at 690 nm absorbance approximately one minute following mixing. For each well, an absorbance scan and fluorescence measurements (described above) were also taken, and these data matched the results obtained at 690 nm. Time series (2.5 min) of absorbance and fluorescence measurements were taken for each well, but no changes were observed, indicating the reactions had reached equilibrium.
Phenazine redox reactions were monitored over time under oxic conditions with an aerobic Beckman Coulter DU 800 spectrophotometer. The instrument was blanked with PBS. Plastic cuvettes were filled with 500 μL PBS (oxic) or PYO ox and placed inside the instrument and the lid was shut. Reduced phenazine or anoxic PBS was drawn (∼500 μL) from stoppered serum bottles (anoxic) into needled 1 mL syringes. Absorbance measurements at 690 nm (1.5 s intervals) were started on the cuvette and proceeded for 10 s to acquire baseline values. Then the lid was opened, and the syringe was quickly emptied into the cuvette and the lid was closed again. The measurement proceeded until 90 s had elapsed. Reactions were repeated in triplicate.
A single-stranded DNA sequence with the 5ꞌ end modified with a C6 S-S phosphoramidite was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (see Key Resources Table for DNA sequences). The oligonucleotide was reduced using dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma Aldrich, 100 mM) in a buffer solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mM NaCl) for 2 h. The reduced thiol-modified DNA was then purified by size exclusion chromatography (Nap5 Sephadex, G-25, GE Healthcare) with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 50 mM NaCl) as the eluent. Subsequently, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC, HP 1100, Agilent) was performed using a reverse-phase PLRP-S column (Agilent) using a gradient of acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium acetate (5%–15% ammonium acetate over 35 minutes). After HPLC purification, the thiol-modified ss DNA was characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) characterization using a Autoflex MALDI TOF/TOF (Bruker), and quantified using a 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Cary, Agilent). Another ss DNA strand for installing a CC mismatch near the interface between DNA duplexes and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) linker was prepared in an analogous manner as detailed above.
A single-stranded DNA sequence with the 5ꞌ end modified with a C6 NH 2 phosphoramidite was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. HPLC was performed using a reverse-phase PLRP-S column using a gradient of acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium acetate (5%–15% ammonium acetate over 35 minutes). After HPLC purification, the amine-modified oligonucleotide was characterized using MADLI-TOF-MS and quantified using UV-visible spectrophotometry.
Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA, 4.9 mg, 22 μmol) was added to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 9.3 mg, 45 μmol) and N -hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, 5.2 mg, 45 μmol) in degassed, anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF, 500 μL) at RT in a scintillation vial wrapped in aluminum foil. The barely soluble PCA turned from green to yellow upon stirring overnight in the dark under Ar. The NHS-activated PCA solution was reduced to low volume (100 μL) and was then added to a solution containing amine-modified DNA (0.42 μmol) in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT, 1 mg, 7.4 μmol) and N,N,Nꞌ,Nꞌ -tetramethyl- O -(1 H -benzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, 1 mg, 2.6 μmol) in sodium bicarbonate solution (200 μL, pH 8, 0.1 M) overnight in the dark with the 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube wrapped in aluminum foil and mixed thoroughly using the shake function of a benchtop vortexer. The 1.5 mL tube secured using a clip to avoid spilling. The crude product was then buffer exchanged using a NAP-5 size-exclusion column into phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 50 mM NaCl). The treated product was subsequently purified using HPLC on a reverse-phase PLRP-S column with a gradient of acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium acetate (5%–15% ammonium acetate over 35 minutes) while monitoring 252, 260, 280, 354, and 365 nm simultaneously. Pale yellow liquid fractions were collected and freeze-dried on a lyophilizer (Labconco). The resulting yellow dried smear was resuspended in minimal MQ H 2 O and was subsequently analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS.
The two strands of a duplex are synthesized separately, purified, desalted, EtOH precipitated, and stored frozen at −20°C. Prior to electrochemical experiments, the two strands of a duplex were mixed in equimolar (50 μM) in 200 μL phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 50 mM NaCl). The DNA solution was deoxygenated by bubbling Ar for at least 5 minutes per mL, and then annealed on a thermocycler (Beckman Instruments) by initial heating to 90°C followed by slow cooling over a span of 90 min.
Multiplexed chips are gently cleaned by sonicating with acetone once then isopropanol three times before drying with Ar. They are then cleaned with UV/Ozone using a UVO cleaner for 20 minutes. Immediately after cleaning the surface, a plastic clamp and rubber gasket (Buna-N) were affixed to the Au surface to create a well for liquid and 50 μM duplex DNA in phosphate buffer (5 mM phosphate, pH 7, 50 mM NaCl) to make ds DNA-modified surfaces. The ds DNA was incubated on the surface for 18-24 h in the absence of light. Once the ds DNA is affixed to the surface, it cannot be dried without compromising the structure and subsequently the measured properties of the ds DNA-modified surfaces. The solution was then exchanged 3 × with phosphate buffer (pH 7, 5 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) and incubated with 1 mM mercaptohexanol in phosphate buffer (pH 7, 5 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) for 45 minutes. Lastly the surface was rinsed at least 5 × with phosphate buffer (pH 7, 5 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl) that was degassed by leaving open in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Lab Products) for at least 3 days.
Experiments performed were replicated at least three times using different samples, and data presented are from representative trials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), square wave voltammetry (SWV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were carried out using a 620D Electrochemical Workstation (CH Instruments) at room temperature inside an anaerobic chamber. The atmosphere of the anaerobic chamber (< 1 ppm O 2 , ca. 3.4% H 2 ) was monitored using a CAM-12 O 2 and H 2 sensor (Coy Lab Products). The chamber was maintained O 2 -free by using two ventilated Pd catalyst packs (Coy Lab Products).
Electrochemical experiments were carried out in a three-electrode set-up under an anaerobic atmosphere. CV was conducted at a scan rate of 100 mV/s unless otherwise specified. The central well around the multiplexed electrode surfaces created by the plastic clamp was filled with aqueous buffer containing degassed phosphate buffer (pH 7, 5 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl). An Ag/AgCl reference electrode (BASi) was coated with a solidified mixture of 1% agarose and NaCl (3 M) in water inside a long, thin pipette tip. The tip was cut so that the salt bridge could connect the electrode to the buffer from the top of the well. A freshly-polished Pt wire used as an auxiliary electrode was also submerged in the buffer from the top of the well. The working electrode contacted a dry part of unmodified gold surface. Scan rate dependence studies (10-5000 mV/s) were carried out to determine whether the phenazine moiety was covalently attached to the DNA-modified electrodes. A linear relationship between scan rates and measured peak currents signified that phenazine was covalently attached. For O 2 electrocatalysis studies, CV was conducted in open air in O 2 -saturated phosphate buffer (pH 7, 5 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl). Hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride (RuHex, 1-500 μM in pH 7, 5 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl) was used in control experiments to probe whether electron transfer occurred between the Au electrode and the covalently attached PCN through DNA.
The purpose of carrying out the control experiments shown in Figure S4 using electrodes modified using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of double-stranded DNA (ds DNA) was to probe the electron transfer mechanism between the redox probe and the electrode surface. Four sets of control experiments were conducted to probe whether DNA-mediated charge transport (DNA charge transfer) occurs between PCN and the electrode via the base stack of ds DNA: (i) WM- versus MM-DNA, (ii) high- versus low-density monolayers, (iii) PCN versus RuHex, and (iv) scan rate dependence studies. (i) WM- versus MM-DNA: Electrodes modified using SAMs of ds DNA that are well-matched (WM) or contain a single base pair mismatch (MM) were prepared under identical conditions. WM-DNA electrodes and MM-DNA electrodes have similar physical properties but exhibit different charge transfer properties that occur through the aromatic base stacks of DNA. If the electron transfer process between the redox probe and the electrode occurs via DNA charge transfer, then a decrease in the yield of DNA charge transfer is expected due to the perturbation to the base stack introduced by the MM lesion. If the electron transfer process occurs via other modes such as physical diffusion of a charge carrier or physical contact between the redox probe and the electrode surface, then no difference in the current measured would be expected. (ii) High- versus low-density monolayers: Electrodes modified using high- and low-density SAMs of ds DNA were used to probe the effect of the number of ds DNA on the charge transport mechanism. A low-density ds DNA monolayer promotes electron transport within one ds DNA, but ds DNA may adopt various conformations because the individual ds DNA are more distantly spaced. A high-density ds DNA monolayer encourages ds DNA to align with each other in a more orderly fashion due to more ds DNA present in a confined space. Regardless of a high- or low-density monolayer, for the case of PCN-modified DNA-SAM, MM discrimination was observed, suggesting that DNA charge transfer is the major mode of electron transport between the electrode and the redox probe. (iii) PCN versus RuHex: RuHex is a positively-charged species that binds electrostatically to the negatively-charged phosphate backbone. RuHex also associates to the OH groups at the terminus of the SAM surface passivated by backfilling using mercaptohexanol. Electrons tunnel through the SAM from the electrode to the RuHex situated at the SAM terminus. Electrons can then be transferred and be distributed among the Ruhex bound to the SAM surface and on the DNA phosphate backbone. Residual RuHex present in solution could help with ET through hopping and diffusion in solution, and the contribution of solution-based ET to the current measured depends on the concentration of RuHex used. Therefore a number of RuHex concentrations were screened in order to optimize the conditions for this measurement. For species that do not participate in DNA charge transfer, no MM discrimination will be observed. The RuHex experiments showthat the number of ds DNA on the SAM-modified electrodes is similar for both the WM and MM cases. The observation of a sizable MM discrimination demonstrates that PCN bound on DNA participates in DNA charge transfer. (iv) Scan rate dependence studies (10-5000 mV/s) were carried out to determine whether the phenazine moiety was covalently attached to the DNA-modified electrodes. A linear relationship between scan rates and measured peak currents signified that phenazine was covalently attached.
Colony biofilms ( Δphz ∗ ) were grown and suspensions were prepared in 500 μL PBS, as described above for the LC-MS and eDNA measurements. 400 μL of the suspension was transferred to a clean quartz cuvette. Time-resolved emission measurements utilized a YAG laser (λ exc = 532 nm), with laser powers of ∼2 mJ per pulse. A colored-glass longpass filter (λ > 600 nm) was used to minimize scattered laser light and the emission of the Ru(phen) 2 dppz 2+ complex was monitored at 620 nm. An excitation pulse (532 nm) was delivered and emission was recorded at 620 nm for 1.9 μs and each time point was 0.2 ns. A background scan was acquired with only the biofilm suspension. Then 5 μM Ru(phen) 2 dppz 2+ was added and a scan was recorded. Subsequently, 5 μM Rh(phi) 2 bpy 3+ was added after each scan to acquire the 1, 2, 3 and 4 quencher equivalent datasets. This process was repeated for multiple biofilms and a liquid Δphz ∗ culture that was concentrated to the same optical density (500 nm) as the biofilm suspensions. Datasets were background subtracted from the biofilm only background scan and were fit with biexponential decay models.
Gold IDA electrodes were prepared as previously described ( Boyd et al., 2015 10. Boyd, D.A. ∙ Snider, R.M. ∙ Erickson, J.S. ... Theory of redox conduction and the measurement of electron transport rates through electrochemically active biofilms Beyenal, H. ∙ Babauta, J. (Editors) Biofilms in Bioelectrochemical Systems John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2015 Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar ). IDAs fabricated on glass substrate were ordered from CH Instruments (#012125). A passivation membrane covered the working electrodes except for the overlapping regions that form the 5 μm gap and where the leads were attached. Insulated wires (Digi-Key #W7-ND) were attached to the two working electrodes of the IDA with a conductive epoxy (Electron Microscopy Sciences #12670-EE) that was cured at 80°C for 1 hour. A shell for the IDA construct was constructed from 15 mL conical vials that were sawed off at the 2.5 mL mark. Rough edges were smoothed with a razor blade, and two holes were poked in the bottom of the vial. The IDA with attached wires was placed inside the conical vial and the wires were threaded through the holes at the bottom. A nonconductive epoxy (Amron International #2131-B) was carefully pipetted into the vial with the IDA until it was full to the rim. The epoxy was allowed to set at room temperature in a fume hood for 24-48 hours. IDA constructs were then used immediately or stored in Petri dishes and covered to protect from light and dust.
Reactors (Pine Instruments, 265 mL water-jacketed electrochemical reactor) used to grow biofilms on the IDA were cleaned thoroughly and autoclaved between uses. For gas control, the ports were stoppered or sealed with o-rings and screw clamps. Gas inflow and outflow lines were attached via 6 inch gassing needles and 16 g 1.5 in needles, respectively, pierced through separate stoppers. Gas outflow was attached to a liquid overflow vessel, a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask that also had 16 g needles as inflow and outflows. The water jacket of each reactor was connected in series to a water chiller (Lytron) to heat the vessels to ∼31°C. Each reactor was filled with 180mL of sterile medium and the IDA construct was suspended from a stopper (size 4) by threading the wires through 16 g needles and then removing the needles, so that the electrode was fully submerged in the liquid. IDAs were sterilized in 10% bleach for 30 s, then rinsed in sterile medium before submerging in the reactor.
Biofilms were grown in a minimal medium (MM) with succinate as the carbon source (14.15 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 38.85 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 42.8 mM NaCl, 9.3 mM NH 4 Cl, 40 mM Na-succinate, adjusted to pH 7.2 and autoclaved then 1x SL-10 trace element solution [ Atlas, 2004 5. Atlas, R. Handbook of Microbiological Media CRC Press, 2004 Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar ] and 1 mM MgSO 4 ). From a stationary phase MM culture, the reactors with 180 mL MM were inoculated to an OD 500 of 0.005. The medium was exchanged every 24 hours, and biofilms were grown on the IDA for 3 or 4 days in this fashion. During growth, constant temperature was maintained at ∼31°C, reactors were stirred at 250 rpm (VWR #58948-138) and air was bubbled into two reactors at a time with a small aquarium bubbler (Tetra #77851). Depending on the experiment, biofilms were grown with or without the full electrochemical setup described below. At a minimum, biofilms were grown with the IDA working electrode (disconnected from potentiostat).
Electrochemistry was performed using a three-electrode setup and CHI 760b or CHI 760e bipotentiostats. The working electrode(s) were on the IDA and connected to wires as described above. The counter electrode was a separate graphite rod (Alfa Aesar #14738) and the reference electrode was a separate Ag/AgCl electrode (BASi #MW-2030 or #MF-2079) assembled as described in the above DNA charge transfer section. Before measurements were made in a reactor, the medium was sparged with N 2 for at least 10 min. Reactors were gently bubbled with N 2 throughout the measurements. Unless otherwise noted Generator-Collector scans were acquired at 3 mV/s, with the collector held at 0 mV. Square wave voltammetry was performed at 300 hz with an amplitude of 25 mV and an increment of 1 mV. Chronoamperometry of metabolic current was acquired at +100 mV.
For experiments where biofilms were soaked in synthetic PYO, biofilms were soaked for at least 10 min. To transfer the IDA biofilm, the potentiostat leads were removed and the reference and counter leads were attached to the transfer reactor electrodes. The IDA biofilm was dipped in fresh medium to remove solution PYO and then submerged in the transfer reactor. The working electrodes were attached, and the open circuit potential was measured to ensure proper connections – this took roughly 30 s. For time sensitive experiments, SWVs were immediately recorded. For biofilm D ap and D loss measurements SWV and GC scans were taken consecutively (manually or with a macro) until 15 of each scan had been acquired. For blank D loss measurements, rapid consecutive SWV scans were taken in an automated fashion using the “repeated runs” option in the CHI software. For blank D ap measurements, the blank IDA was incubated with increasing concentrations of PYO in the soak reactor.
IDA biofilms were prepared for imaging by removing the biofilm coated region of the IDA from the epoxy encased shell. The exposed region of the glass substrate near the epoxy interface was scored with a diamond tipped scribe and then it was snapped off from the rest of the vial/epoxy assembly. With tweezers the IDA fragment was transferred to a slide with a multi-well silicone spacer and dye mixture was added with a pipette directly to the edge of the IDA fragment until it was fully coated. The dye mixture was 10 μM Syto60 (Invitrogen #S11342) and 1 or 2 μM TOTO-1 (Invitrogen T3600) in PBS. Coverslips (#1.5) were added directly on top of the mixture and sealed with clear nail polish to the spacer.
Slides were then imaged on a confocal microscope. Most imaging was done using an upright Zeiss LSM 880 with Fast Airyscan. Syto60 was excited with a 633 nm laser and emission was typically recorded with a bandpass filter from 650 to 750 nm. TOTO-1 was excited with a 488 or 514 nm laser and emission was typically recorded with a bandpass filter from 530 to 630 nm. Tilescans were taken using a 10x objective and high magnification images were taken with a 63x objective. Several images were taken at 63x magnification using the Airyscan module with superresolution settings. For Airyscan images the appropriate filter cubes were used.
Other imaging was done on an inverted confocal Leica model TCS SPE with a 10x objective for tile scanning. Syto60 was excited with a 633 nm laser, TOTO-1 was excited with a 488 nm laser, and emissions were set by band pass filters as above.
To measure D ap , we compared two electrochemical measurements that depend on D ap in different ways. By performing this comparison at multiple concentrations, we could fit the data points to a line whose slope can be defined by known parameters, yielding D ap . Δphz ∗ biofilms were soaked in 75 μM of PYO and then transferred to fresh medium lacking PYO. The biofilm PYO concentration dropped over the course of 45 min as equilibration with the medium occurred. Approximately 15 sets of scans were taken during this time period.
The first measurement was square wave voltammetry (SWV) ( Figure 5 D). The SWV peak current (I swv ) is defined in terms of concentration of redox molecules ( C ) reacting directly (by physical diffusion) or indirectly (through electron self-exchange reactions) with the electrode (D ap ), the area of the electrode ( A ), the number of electrons per redox reaction ( n ), the Faraday constant ( F ), the pulse width ( t p ) and a normalization constant ( 𝜙 ) . Note that I swv depends on the square root of D ap . 𝐼 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑣 = 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜙 (Equation 1) The second measurement was a generator-collector (GC) measurement ( Figure 5 E). The maximum GC current (I gc ) is also defined in terms of C , D ap , n , and F , but depends on a geometric factor ( S ) ( Boyd et al., 2015 10. Boyd, D.A. ∙ Snider, R.M. ∙ Erickson, J.S. ... Theory of redox conduction and the measurement of electron transport rates through electrochemically active biofilms Beyenal, H. ∙ Babauta, J. (Editors) Biofilms in Bioelectrochemical Systems John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2015 Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar ) as opposed to the electrode area. Note that I gc depends directly on D ap . 𝐼 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑐 = 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 (Equation 2) A plot of experimentally determined I gc versus I swv values yields linear relationships for PYO in biofilms and in solution (i.e., blank IDA) ( Figures 5 F and S6 ), with slope ( m ) that can be defined in terms I gc and I swv : 𝑚 = 𝐼 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑐 𝐼 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑣 = 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜙 (Equation 3) 𝑚 = 𝑆 ⁢ √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑝 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 𝐴 ⁢ 𝜙 (Equation 4) This relationship enables determination of D ap from the experimentally determined dependency of I gc to I swv (i.e., m ) in terms of known experimental parameters ( Figure 5 H). Importantly, it provides a means of determining D ap that is not dependent on knowing C, which for our system is unknown and changes over time as PYO diffuses out of the biofilm. 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 = ( 𝑚 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝜙 ) 2 𝑆 2 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑝 (Equation 5) Note that because the slope of these plots is linear, it suggests that D ap is constant for a biofilm despite how the concentration of PYO changes as it diffuses. We assume a constant D ap by fitting the data with a linear model.
In order to measure the physical diffusion coefficient of PYO molecules lost from the IDA-grown biofilms, we monitored the loss of biofilm PYO over time as it equilibrated with the fresh medium similar to an approach taken with polymer films ( White et al., 1982 83. White, H.S. ∙ Leddy, J. ∙ Bard, A.J. Polymer films on electrodes. 8. Investigation of charge-transport mechanisms in Nafion polymer modified electrodes J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104 :4811-4817 Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar ). To quantify this process, we used successive SWV scans acquired over 45 min following transfer to fresh medium (the SWV subset of the D ap data). A 1-dimensional diffusion model was then applied to fit the decay of I swv yielding an estimate of D loss .
Considering 1-dimensional diffusion of an initial mass ( M 0 ) of a substance from a point source, the solution of Fick’s second law describing the time-dependent concentration gradient is given by Equation 6 where x is distance normal from the source, A is the cross-sectional area in 3D space, and D loss is the physical diffusion coefficient. 𝐶 ⁡ ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑀 0 𝐴 ⁢ √ 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑥 2 4 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 (Equation 6) When the source is located at no-flux boundary such that the mass diffuses only to one side, 𝐶 ⁡ ( 𝑥 = 0 , 𝑡 ) = 2 ⁢ 𝑀 0 𝐴 ⁢ √ 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 (Equation 7) where C(x = 0, t) is the time dependent concentration at the surface of the no-flux boundary (e.g., the IDA surface).
To connect this model to the data, the concentration and initial mass can be defined in terms of the measured SWV current (I swv ). For SWV, the concentration, C , is given by: 𝐶 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐼 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⁢ √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑝 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜙 (Equation 8) Concentration can be defined as the mass per volume, so the initial mass, M 0 , can be expressed in terms of the effective volume probed by the electrode ( V ): 𝑀 0 = 𝑉 ⁢ 𝐼 0 ⁢ √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑝 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜙 (Equation 9) The initial current is defined as I swv (t = 0) = I 0 , which is experimentally estimated from the last I swv in the PYO soak, before transfer to PYO-free medium. This is a conservative overestimate, because some of the soak signal comes from the solution PYO. Substituting the values for C ( Equation 8 ) and M 0 ( Equation 9 ) into Equation 7 yields: 𝐼 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 2 ⁢ 𝐼 0 ⁡ 𝑉 𝐴 ⁢ √ 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 (Equation 10) The term V refers to the biofilm volume from which the mass of PYO was detected by the electrode. For a 1D electrode process, the concentration gradient extends from the electrode-solution interface ( C = 0 ) to the edge of the diffusion layer, 𝛿 ( C = C bulk ) in a near linear fashion ( Bard et al., 1980 6. Bard, A.J. ∙ Faulkner, L.R. ∙ Leddy, J. ... Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications Wiley, 1980 Google Scholar ). There is no region where all of the mass is detected, but the electrode has detected one half of the mass in the volume 𝐴 × 𝛿 , therefore the effective V can be defined: 𝑉 = 𝐴 ⁢ 𝛿 2 (Equation 11) The diffusion layer, 𝛿 , for a single potential step can be estimated by: 𝛿 = 2 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑠 (Equation 12) where t s is the amount of time that the driving potential is held. SWV is a series of forward and reverse potential steps for which we could not unequivocally define an equivalent t s value, however, we discuss reasonable bounds in the assumptions section below. Substituting into Equation 11 yields 𝑉 = 𝐴 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑠 , therefore Equation 10 can be written as: 𝐼 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐼 0 ⁡ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑠 √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 (Equation 13) And with that expression we can fit the decay of I swv (t) to a model of the form: 𝑦 = 𝑏 √ 𝑡 + 𝑎 (Equation 14) where the coefficient, b , is described in known variables except for D loss and where a accounts for any constant background signal. 𝑏 = 𝐼 0 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑠 √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 (Equation 15) Therefore, D loss can be calculated from the fit data as ( Figures 5 G and S7 ): 𝐷 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 = 𝐼 2 0 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑠 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑏 2 (Equation 16)
The D loss analysis described above is based on a number of assumptions. It assumes, for example, that the biofilms are homogeneous. In reality, they are heterogeneous, containing many voids and obstacles (e.g., cells and exopolysaccharides) through which diffusion would not occur. We contend heterogeneity would affect D loss and D ap in a similar manner, as it reduces the biofilm volume in which PYO resides. As such, we don’t expect biofilm heterogeneity to greatly affect the determination of D loss from D ap . Importantly, our analysis assumes a single infinitely thick phase described by a single D loss . In reality, there are at least two phases, a thin biofilm adjoining an infinitely thick solution. If D loss in solution is greater than in the biofilm, then at any instance the concentration gradient of PYO across the biofilm will be steeper than predicted by the model. Since the flux of PYO out of the biofilm at any instance is proportional to the product of the gradient and D loss , as the model fits the rate of change of PYO in the biofilm the assumption of a shallower gradient than the actual gradient is expected to result in a calculated D loss that is higher than the actual D loss .
To estimate the scan time parameter, t s , we assumed that for the blank IDA D ap = D loss and solved for t s that best fit the I swv decay for the blank IDA. We then used this value, t s = 21 ms, to calculate D loss for the biofilm IDAs. The scan time parameter is intended to estimate the thickness of the diffusion layer that is formed during a single potential step that drives the flux of the electrode reactant resulting in the observed current. SWV is, however, a series of forward and reverse potential steps superimposed on a series of forward potential steps. Therefore, determining the effective scan time that describes the change in thickness of the diffusion layer that occurs during the forward pulse contributing to I swv is nontrivial (we only consider the forward pulse as the reverse scan partially replenishes the electrode reactant that is depleted during the forward scan). One approach to estimate t s is setting the SWV expression equal to twice the Cottrell equation ( Equations 17 & 18 ), since I swv is the net current from the forward and reverse pulses. For a pulse amplitude of 0.025 V and step increment of 0.001 V as used here, each potential step is effectively 0.05 V. The potential at which the I swv occurs is the formal potential of the electrode reactant and applying the Nernst equation, the fraction of electrode reactant in the oxidized state at the electrode surface at the start of the forward potential step generating I swv (E = Eo’+ 0.025 V) is 82.6% and at the end (E = Eo −0.025 V) is 17.4%. The Cottrell equation assumes the potential step drives a redox reaction in which 100% of the electrode accessible redox molecules at the electrode go from oxidized to reduced (or vice versa). Replacing C in the Cottrell equation with 0.655 x C to reflect the fraction of PYO at the electrode surface that changes oxidation state during the forward potential step of the SWV yields an estimate t s ≈ 6 ms. 𝐼 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑣 = 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑝 ⁢ 𝜙 = 2 ⁢ 𝐼 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑠 = 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐴 0 . 6 5 5 × 𝐶 ⁢ √ 𝐷 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 √ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑠 (Equation 17) 𝑡 𝑠 = 𝑡 𝑝 ( 2 × 0 . 6 5 5 ) 2 𝜙 2 (Equation 18) As such, our t s estimate (21 ms) based on the blank D ap = D loss used to estimate D loss for the biofilm may be an overestimate. Noting that D loss scales linearly with t s ( Equation 16 ), this would conservatively underestimate the difference between biofilm D ap and D loss .
The surface area of the electrode for SWV, A = 0.025 cm 2 , and the geometric factor for GC, S = 18.4 cm, were calculated for a blank IDA using the known concentration and D ap for ferrocene methanol ( Boyd et al., 2015 10. Boyd, D.A. ∙ Snider, R.M. ∙ Erickson, J.S. ... Theory of redox conduction and the measurement of electron transport rates through electrochemically active biofilms Beyenal, H. ∙ Babauta, J. (Editors) Biofilms in Bioelectrochemical Systems John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2015 Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar ). All quantified SWVs were acquired with a pulse amplitude of 25 mV at a frequency of 300 Hz and an increment of 1 mV. The SWV pulse time, t p , is one half the square wave period (½ ∗ 1/300 = 1/600 s). Peak separation from CV of PYO in solution indicated that it did not undergo the full 2 electron reduction, but on average underwent electron transfer with n ≈ 1.8. From these acquisition parameters, ϕ = 0.7 was inferred from a table of existing values ( Lovrić, 2010 46. Lovrić, M. Square-wave voltammetry Electroanalytical Methods. Springer, 2010 121-145 Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar ). For the D loss estimate, it was assumed that I 0 was the soak SWV peak current. The equivalent scan time, t s , for the D loss calculation is discussed above.
Electrochemical experiments were recorded with a bi-potentiostat (CHI, Model #760) in a Teflon cell designed in-house to mount gold interdigitated array (IDA) electrodes from CHI. The counter and reference electrodes were a Pt coiled wire and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All measurements were recorded at room temperature in 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 as the electrolyte purged with Argon. The IDA electrodes were modified with Nafion film by pipetting 20 μL of a 5% wt Nafion solution (Sigma Aldrich) onto the IDA electrodes and allowing a film to form as the solution dried at room temperature. After 2 hours, the modified IDAs were rinsed with ethanol and DI water and then mounted into the base of the Teflon cell.
The Nafion films on the IDAs mounted in the Teflon cell were loaded with various amounts of Ru(NH 3 ) 6 3+ by either exposing the films to a 10 mM solution of Ru(NH 3 ) 6 Cl 3 (Sigma Aldrich) in 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 at time points from several minutes to several hours or by allowing Ru(NH 3 ) 6 3+ in the films to diffuse out into bulk electrolyte for several hours. The Nafion films were loaded with Ferrocenemethanol (Fc-OH) by exposing the films to a 250 μM solution of Fc-OH in 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 for several hours. To decrease the amount of Fc-OH in loaded films, the films were allowed to have the Fc-OH in the films to diffuse out into bulk electrolyte for several hours. For each electrochemical measurement after loading or depleting the film, the cell was rinsed with DI water and 2 mL of fresh electrolyte was added. The counter and reference electrodes were position above the IDA electrodes in a Teflon lid, and the electrolyte were purged with Argon for 15 minutes with a blanket of Argon maintained in the head space of the Teflon cell. Three conditions were measured with the Fc-OH - (i) Fc-OH in solution with naked IDAs, (ii) Fc-OH in solution at IDAs modified with Nafion and (iii) Fc-OH loaded into the Nafion modified IDAs.
For the SWV versus GC method, SWV and GC scans were acquired as described above, and Equation 5 was used to calculate Dap with the following parameters: A = 0.0213 cm 2 , ψ = 0.505, S = 18.4 cm, t p = 1/600 s. For chronocoulometry, voltage was stepped from 0 mV to −500 mV versus Ag/AgCl. From the slope of plots of charge versus (time) 1/2 , D ap was calculated from the following equation: 𝐷 = ( 𝑆 ⁢ 𝜋 1 / 2 2 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐶 ) 2 = ( 𝑆 ⁢ Φ ⁢ 𝜋 1 / 2 2 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ Γ ) 2 where S is the chronocoulometric slope (C cm -2 s -1/2 ), Φ is the film thickness (cm), Γ is the total quantity of Ferrocenemethanol in the film (mol cm 2 ), and F is the Faraday constant and C is concentration in moles/cm 3 (C = 2.5 × 10 −7 moles/cm 3 ). A film thickness of 10 μm was estimated from the reported density of casted Nafion films by knowing the amount of Nafion deposited and the area covered by the film.
IDA and colony biofilms were prepared for SEM using the following protocol. Delicate samples were gently transferred between solutions using metal spatulas or plastic grids as supports. Material was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 hours or overnight, then washed twice with PBS. Material was then fixed in 1% OsO 4 in water for 1 hour, then washed twice with PBS. Next, the samples were dehydrated by sequentially immersing in 50, 70, 90, 95 and 100% ethanol (EtOH) solutions for 10 min, and then again in 100% EtOH for 1 hour. Samples were then transferred to hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) solutions of 1:2 then 2:1 HMDS:EtOH for 20 min each, followed by two incubations in 100% HMDS for 20 min each. Samples were then removed from the solution and air-dried before attaching to imaging stubs with conductive tape. Imaging stubs were then sputter coated with 10 nm of palladium before being loaded into the SEM. Imaging was done with a Zeiss 1550VP field emission SEM using the SE2 detector.
Nearly all data processing and analysis was done in R ( R Development Core Team, 2018 57. R Development Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2018 Google Scholar ) using tidyverse packages including ggplot2, dplyr, readr ( Wickham, 2017 84. Wickham, H. tidyverse: Easily Install and Load the “Tidyverse.” (CRAN) 2017 Google Scholar ), broom ( Robinson and Hayes, 2018 61. Robinson, D. ∙ Hayes, A. broom: Convert Statistical Analysis Objects into Tidy Tibbles (CRAN) 2018 Google Scholar ) and hms ( Müller, 2018 52. Müller, K. hms: Pretty Time of Day (CRAN) 2018 Google Scholar ). The nonlinear least-squares (‘nls’) function in base R was used for D loss fits and the linear model (‘lm’) function was used for D ap fits. Electrochemical data was exported from CHI software as text files with raw data, acquisition parameters and timestamps and then imported into R. Confocal images were stitched (for tilescans) and processed into z-slices or maximum intensity projections using the Zeiss Zen Black software and Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 63. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (38225) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Throughout the manuscript sample sizes are reported as biological or technical replicates, as appropriate. Typically, center points are means and error bars are 95% confidence intervals or two standard deviations, although it is noted when error bars represent other measures. Welch’s t test (unequal variance – one-sided) was used to compare means. Statistically significant difference in means was determined for p values < 0.05. All code for each figure, including statistical tests, is available in a GitHub repository ( https://github.com/DKN-lab/phz_eDNA_2019 ) and html versions of the Rmarkdown notebooks are also available as a website ( https://DKN-lab.github.io/phz_eDNA_2019 ).
