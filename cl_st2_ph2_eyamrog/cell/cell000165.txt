Title: Tracking Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: Evidence that D614G Increases Infectivity of the COVID-19 Virus


Abstract: Summary

A SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying the Spike protein amino acid change D614G has become the most prevalent form in the global pandemic. Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies revealed a recurrent pattern of G614 increase at multiple geographic levels: national, regional, and municipal. The shift occurred even in local epidemics where the original D614 form was well established prior to introduction of the G614 variant. The consistency of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness advantage. We found that the G614 variant grows to a higher titer as pseudotyped virions. In infected individuals, G614 is associated with lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds, suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, but not with increased disease severity. These findings illuminate changes important for a mechanistic understanding of the virus and support continuing surveillance of Spike mutations to aid with development of immunological interventions.

Section: Introduction

The past two decades have seen three major pathogenic zoonotic disease outbreaks caused by betacoronaviruses ( Cui et al., 2019 12. Cui, J. ∙ Li, F. ∙ Shi, Z.-L.

Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :325-328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1693) PubMed Google Scholar ). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002, infecting ∼8,000 people with a 10% mortality. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 with ∼2,300 cases and 35% mortality ( Graham and Baric, 2010 25. Graham, R.L. ∙ Baric, R.S. Recombination, reservoirs, and the modular spike: mechanisms of coronavirus cross-species transmission J. Virol. 2010; 84 :3134-3146 Crossref Scopus (513) PubMed Google Scholar ). The third, SARS-CoV-2, causes the severe respiratory disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ( Gorbalenya et al., 2020 24. Gorbalenya, A.E. ∙ Baker, S.C. ∙ Baric, R.S. ..., Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2 Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :536-544 Crossref Scopus (5188) PubMed Google Scholar ). First reported in China in December 2019 ( Zhou et al., 2020 85. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.-L. ∙ Wang, X.-G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14912) PubMed Google Scholar ), it rapidly became a pandemic with devastating effects. The June 21, 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) Situation Report records over 8.7 million COVID-19 cases and 460,000 deaths, numbers that increase daily. Humans have no direct immunological experience with SARS-CoV-2, leaving us vulnerable to infection and disease. SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible: basic reproduction number, R 0, estimates vary between 2.2 and 3.9 ( Lv et al., 2020 45. Lv, M. ∙ Luo, X. ∙ Estill, J. ..., On Behalf Of The Covid-Evidence And Recommendations Working Group Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a scoping review Euro Surveill. 2020; 25 :2000125 Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar ). Estimates of mortality vary regionally between 0.8% and 14.5% (mortality analyses, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine)
Coronaviruses have genetic proofreading mechanisms ( Sevajol et al., 2014 57. Sevajol, M. ∙ Subissi, L. ∙ Decroly, E. ... Insights into RNA synthesis, capping, and proofreading mechanisms of SARS-coronavirus Virus Res. 2014; 194 :90-99 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smith et al., 2013 60.

Coronaviruses lacking exoribonuclease activity are susceptible to lethal mutagenesis: evidence for proofreading and potential therapeutics PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 :e1003565 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), and SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity is very low ( Fauver et al., 2020 19. Fauver, J.R. ∙ Petrone, M.E. ∙ Hodcroft, E.B. ... Coast-to-Coast Spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the Early Epidemic in the United States Cell. 2020; 181 :990-996.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ). Still, natural selection can act upon rare but favorable mutations. By analogy, antigenic drift results in gradual accumulation of mutations by the influenza virus during flu season, and the complex interplay between immunological resistance mutations and the fitness landscape enables antibody resistance to develop across populations ( Wu et al., 2020 75. Wu, A. ∙ Peng, Y. ∙ Huang, B. ... Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :325-328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1693) PubMed Google Scholar ), driving the need to develop new influenza vaccines every few seasons. Longer flu seasons have increased opportunities for selection pressure ( Boni et al., 2006 3. Boni, M.F. ∙ Gog, J.R. ∙ Andreasen, V. ... Epidemic dynamics and antigenic evolution in a single season of influenza A Proc. Biol. Sci. 2006; 273 :1307-1316 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although SARS-CoV-2 shows evidence of some seasonal waning ( Sehra et al., 2020 56. Sehra, S.T. ∙ Salciccioli, J.D. ∙ Wiebe, D.J. ... Maximum Daily Temperature, Precipitation, Ultra-Violet Light and Rates of Transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in the United States Clin. Infect. Dis. 2020; ciaa681 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), the persistence of the pandemic may enable accumulation of immunologically relevant mutations in the population even as vaccines are developed. Antigenic drift is seen among the common cold coronaviruses OC43 ( Ren et al., 2015 53. Ren, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, J. ... Genetic drift of human coronavirus OC43 spike gene during adaptive evolution Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :11451 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vijgen et al., 2005 67. Vijgen, L. ∙ Keyaerts, E. ∙ Lemey, P. ... Circulation of genetically distinct contemporary human coronavirus OC43 strains Virology. 2005; 337 :85-92 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 229E ( Chibo and Birch, 2006 7. Chibo, D. ∙ Birch, C. Analysis of human coronavirus 229E spike and nucleoprotein genes demonstrates genetic drift between chronologically distinct strains J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87 :1203-1208 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in SARS-CoV-1 ( Guan et al., 2003 26. Guan, Y. ∙ Zheng, B.J. ∙ He, Y.Q. ... Isolation and characterization of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in southern China Science. 2003; 302 :276-278 Crossref Scopus (1848) PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2005 61. Song, H.D. ∙ Tu, C.C. ∙ Zhang, G.W. ... Cross-host evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in palm civet and human Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :2430-2435 Crossref Scopus (549) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, a single SARS-CoV-1 amino acid change, Spike D480A/G in the receptor binding domain (RBD), arose in infected humans and civets and became the dominant variant among 2003/2004 viruses. D480A/G escapes neutralizing antibody 80R, and immune pressure from 80R in vitro could recapitulate emergence of the D480 mutation ( Sui et al., 2008 62. Sui, J. ∙ Aird, D.R. ∙ Tamin, A. ... Broadening of neutralization activity to directly block a dominant antibody-driven SARS-coronavirus evolution pathway PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4 :e1000197 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although there is no evidence yet of antigenic drift for SARS-CoV-2, with extended human-to-human transmission, SARS-CoV-2 could also acquire mutations with fitness advantages and immunological resistance. Attending to this risk now by identifying evolutionary transitions that may be relevant to the fitness or antigenic profile of the virus is important to ensure effectiveness of the vaccines and immunotherapeutic interventions as they advance to the clinic.
In response to the urgent need to develop effective vaccines and antibody-based therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2, over 90 vaccine and 50 antibody approaches are currently being explored ( Cohen, 2020 8. Cohen, J. COVID-19 shot protects monkeys Science. 2020; 368 :456-457 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2020 79. Yu, J. ∙ Tostanoski, L.H. ∙ Peter, L. ... DNA vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; eabc6284 Crossref Scopus (775) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most target the trimeric Spike protein, which mediates host cell binding and entry and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies ( Chen et al., 2020 5. Chen, W.H. ∙ Hotez, P.J. ∙ Bottazzi, M.E. Potential for developing a SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein as a heterologous human vaccine against coronavirus infectious disease (COVID)-19 Hum. Vaccin.

A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Science. 2020; eabb7269 Google Scholar ). Spike monomers are comprised of an N-terminal S 1 subunit that mediates receptor binding and a membrane-proximal S 2 subunit that mediates membrane fusion ( Hoffmann et al., 2020a 30.

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 share ∼79% sequence identity ( Lu et al., 2020 44. Lu, R. ∙ Zhao, X. ∙ Li, J. ... Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding Lancet. 2020; 395 :565-574 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8467) PubMed Google Scholar ), and both use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their cellular receptor. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-1 Spike are complex. In some patients with rapid and high neutralizing antibody responses, an early decline of these responses is associated with increased severity of disease and a higher risk of death ( Ho et al., 2005 29. Ho, M.-S. ∙ Chen, W.-J. ∙ Chen, H.-Y. ... Neutralizing antibody response and SARS severity Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11 :1730-1737 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2006 41.

Zhang, L. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ Yu, W. ... Antibody responses against SARS coronavirus are correlated with disease outcome of infected individuals J. Med. Virol. 2006; 78 :1-8 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 Spike mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection in vitro and exacerbate disease in animal models ( Jaume et al., 2011 34. Jaume, M. ∙ Yip, M.S. ∙ Cheung, C.Y. ...

Antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS coronavirus infection and its role in the pathogenesis of SARS Hong Kong Med. J. 2016; 22 :25-31 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Most current SARS-CoV-2 immunogens and testing reagents are based on the Spike protein sequence of the Wuhan reference sequence ( Wang et al., 2020 73. Wang, C. ∙ Liu, Z. ∙ Chen, Z. ... The establishment of reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 and variation analysis J. Med. Virol. 2020; 92 :667-674 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ), and first-generation antibody therapeutic agents were discovered based on early pandemic infections and evaluated using the Wuhan reference sequence proteins. Alterations of the reference sequence as the virus propagates in human-to-human transmission could potentially alter the viral phenotype and/or the efficacy of immune-based interventions. Therefore, we designed bioinformatics tools to create an “early warning” strategy to evaluate Spike evolution during the pandemic to enable testing of mutations for phenotypic implications and generation of appropriate antibody breadth evaluation panels as vaccines and antibody-based therapeutic agents progress. Phylogenetic analysis of the global sampling of SARS-CoV-2 is being very capably addressed by the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ; Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017 18. Elbe, S. ∙ Buckland-Merrett, G. Data, disease and diplomacy: GISAID’s innovative contribution to global health Glob. Chall. 2017; 1 :33-46 Crossref Scopus (1186) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shu and McCauley, 2017 58. Shu, Y. ∙ McCauley, J. GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data - from vision to reality Euro Surveill. 2017; 22 :30494 Crossref Scopus (1757) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Nextstrain ( https://nextstrain.org ; Hadfield et al., 2018 28. Hadfield, J. ∙ Megill, C. ∙ Bell, S.M. ... Nextstrain: real-time tracking of pathogen evolution Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4121-4123 Crossref Scopus (1872) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in a setting of low genetic diversity like that of SARS-CoV-2, with very few de novo mutational events, phylogenetic methods that use homoplasy to identify positive selection ( Crispell et al., 2019 11. Crispell, J. ∙ Balaz, D. ∙ Gordon, S.V. HomoplasyFinder: a simple tool to identify homoplasies on a phylogeny Microb. Genom. 2019; 5 e000245 PubMed Google Scholar ) have limited statistical power. Additionally, recombination can add a confounding factor to phylogenetic reconstructions, and recombination is known to play a role in natural coronavirus evolution ( Graham and Baric, 2010 25. Graham, R.L. ∙ Baric, R.S. Recombination, reservoirs, and the modular spike: mechanisms of coronavirus cross-species transmission J.

Evolutionary Trajectory for the Emergence of Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Pathogens. 2020; 9 :240 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), and recombinant sequences (potential sequencing artifacts) have been found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences ( De Maio et al., 2020 14. De Maio, N. ∙ Walker, C. ∙ Borges, R. ... Issues with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473 Date: 2020 Google Scholar ). Given these issues, we developed an alternative indicator of potential positive selection by identifying variants that are recurrently becoming more prevalent in different geographic locations. If increases in relative frequency of a particular variant are observed repeatedly in distinct geographic regions, then that variant becomes a candidate for conferring a selective advantage.
Single amino acid changes are worth monitoring because they can be phenotypically relevant. Among coronaviruses, point mutations have been demonstrated to confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies in MERS-CoV ( Tang et al., 2014 64. Tang, X.-C. ∙ Agnihothram, S.S. ∙ Jiao, Y. ...

We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify Spike amino acid variants that are increasing in frequency across many geographic regions by monitoring GISAID data. By early April 2020, it was clear that the Spike D614G mutation exhibited this behavior, and G614 has since become the dominant form in the pandemic. We present experimental evidence that the G614 variant is associated with greater infectivity as well as clinical evidence that it is associated with higher viral loads. We continue to monitor other mutations in Spike for frequency shifts at regional and global levels and provide regular updates at a public web site ( https://cov.lanl.gov/ ).

Section: Results

Our analysis pipeline to track SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the COVID-19 pandemic is based on regular updates from the GISAID SARS-CoV-2 sequence database (GISAID acknowledgments are in Table S1 ). GISAID sequences are generally linked to the location and date of sampling. Our website provides visualizations and summary data that allow regional tracking of SARS-CoV-2 mutations over time. Hundreds of new SARS-CoV-2 sequences are added to GISAID each day, so we have automated steps to create daily working alignments ( Kurtz et al., 2004 36. Kurtz, S. ∙ Phillippy, A. ∙ Delcher, A.L. ... Versatile and open software for comparing large genomes Genome Biol. 2004; 5 :R12 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 ). The analysis presented here is based on a May 29, 2020 download of the GISAID data, when our Spike alignment included 28,576 sequences; updated versions of key figures can recreated at our website ( https://cov.lanl.gov ). The overall evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 is very low, so we set a low threshold for a Spike mutation to be deemed “of interest,” and we track all sites in Spike where 0.3% of the sequences differ from the Wuhan reference sequence, monitoring them for increasing frequency over time in geographic regions as well as for recurrence in different geographic regions. Here we present results for the first amino acid variant to stand out by these metrics, D614G.
The Spike D614G amino acid change is caused by an A-to-G nucleotide mutation at position 23,403 in the Wuhan reference strain; it was the only site identified in our first Spike variation analysis in early March 2020 that met our threshold criterion. At that time, the G614 form was rare globally but gaining prominence in Europe, and GISAID was also tracking the clade carrying the D614G substitution, designating it the “G clade.” The D614G change is almost always accompanied by three other mutations: a C-to-T mutation in the 5′ UTR (position 241 relative to the Wuhan reference sequence), a silent C-to-T mutation at position 3,037, and a C-to-T mutation at position 14,408 that results in an amino acid change in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp P323L). The haplotype comprising these 4 genetically linked mutations is now the globally dominant form. Prior to March 1, 2020, it was found in 10% of 997 global sequences; between March 1 and March 31, 2020, it represented 67% of 14,951 sequences; and between April 1 and May 18, 2020 (the last data point available in our May 29, 2020 sample), it represented 78% of 12,194 sequences. The transition from D614 to G614 occurred asynchronously in different regions throughout the world, beginning in Europe, followed by North America and Oceania and then Asia ( Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , S2 , and S3 ).
We developed two statistical approaches to assess the consistency and significance of the D614-to-G614 transition. In general, to observe a significant change in the frequency of variants in a geographic region, three requirements must be met. First, both variants must at some point be co-circulating in the geographic area. Second, there must be sampling over an adequate duration to observe a change in frequency. Third, enough samples must be available for adequate statistical power to detect a difference. Both of our approaches enable us to systematically extract all GISIAD local and regional data that meet these three requirements.
Our first approach requires that there be an “onset,” defined as the first day where the cumulative number of sequences reached 15 and both forms were represented at least 3 times; we further require that there be at least 15 sequences available at least 2 weeks after onset. Each geographic region that meets these criteria is extracted separately based on the hierarchical geographic/political levels designated in GISAID ( Figure 1 B). A two-sided Fisher’s exact test compares the counts in the pre-onset period with the counts after the 2-week delay period and provides a p value against the null hypothesis that the fraction of D614 versus G614 sequences did not change. All regions that met the above criteria and that showed a significant change in either direction (p < 0.05) are included. Almost all shifted toward increasing G614 frequencies: 5 of 5 continents, 16 of 17 countries (two-sided binomial p value of 0.00027), 16 of 16 regions (p = 0.00003), and 11 of 12 counties and cities (p = 0.0063).
In Figure 2 (Europe), Figure S2 (North America), and Figure S3 (Australia and Asia), we break down the relationships shown in Figure 1 B in detail. The G614 variant increased in frequency even in regions where D614 was the clearly dominant form of a well-established local epidemic when G614 entered the population. Examples of this scenario include Wales, Nottingham, and Spain ( Figure 2 ); Snohomish county and King county ( Figure S2 ); and New South Wales, China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand ( Figure S3 ). Although introduction of a new variant might sometimes result in emergence of the new form because of stochastic effects or serial re-introductions or apparent emergence because of sampling biases, the consistency of the shift to G614 across regions is striking. The increase in G614 often continued after national stay-at-home orders were implemented and, in some cases, beyond the 2-week maximum incubation period.
We found two exceptions to the pattern of increasing G614 frequency in Figure 1 B; details regarding these cases are shown in Figure S4 . The first is Iceland. Changes in sampling strategy during a regional molecular epidemiology survey conducted through the month of March 2020 might explain this exception ( Gudbjartsson et al., 2020 27. Gudbjartsson, D.F. ∙ Helgason, A. ∙ Jonsson, H. ... Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic Population N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :2302-2315 Crossref Scopus (875) PubMed Google Scholar ). In early March 2020, only high-risk people were sampled, the majority being travelers from countries in Europe where G614 dominated. In mid-March 2020, screening began to include the local population; this coincided with the appearance of the D614 variant in the sequence dataset. The second exception is Santa Clara county, one of the most heavily sampled regions in California ( Deng et al., 2020 16. Deng, X. ∙ Gu, W. ∙ Federman, S. ... Genomic surveillance reveals multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Northern California Science. 2020; eabb9263 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). The D614 variant dominates sequences from the Santa Clara Department of Public Health (DPH) to date; the G614 variant was apparently not established in that community. In contrast, a smaller set of Santa Clara county sequences, sampled from mid-March to early April 2020, were specifically noted to be from Stanford; the Stanford samples had a mixture of both forms co-circulating ( Figure S4 ), suggesting that the two communities in Santa Clara County are effectively distinct. A June 19, 2020 GISAID update for several California counties is provided in Figure S4 C, and the G614 form is present in the most recent Santa Clara DPH samples.
Our second statistical approach to evaluating the significance of the D614-to-G614 transition ( Figure 3 ) uses the time series data in GISAID more fully. Here we extracted all regional data from GISAID that had a minimum of 5 sequences representing each of the D614 and the G614 variants and at least 14 days of sampling. We then modeled the daily fraction of G614 as a function of time using isotonic regression, testing the null hypothesis that this fraction does not change over time (i.e., it remains roughly flat over time with equally likely random fluctuations of increase or decrease). We then separately tested the null against two alternative hypotheses: that the fraction of G614 increases or that it decreases. Figure 3 A shows separate p values for all subcountries/states and counties/cities that met the minimal criteria. 30 of 31 subcountries/states with a significant change in frequency were increasing in G614; a binomial test indicates that G614 increases are highly significantly enriched (p = 2.98e–09). This was also found in 17 of 19 counties/cites (p = 0.0007). Figure 3 B shows examples for 3 cities, plotting the daily fraction of G614 as a function of time. Country summaries (similar to Figure 3 A) and plots for all regions (similar to Figure 3 B) are included in Data S1 .
The earliest examples of sequences carrying parts of the 4-mutation haplotype that characterizes the D614G GISAID G clade were found in China and Germany in late January 2020, and they carried 3 of the 4 mutations that define the clade, lacking only the RdRp P323L substitution ( Figure S5 D). This may be an ancestral form of the G clade. One early Wuhan sequence and one early Thai sequence had the D614G change but not the other 3 mutations ( Figure S5 D); these may have arisen independently. The earliest sequence we detected that carried all 4 mutations was sampled in Italy on February 20, 2020 ( Figure S5 D). Within days, this haplotype was sampled in many countries in Europe.
D614 is located on the surface of the Spike protein protomer, where it can form contacts with the neighboring protomer ( Figure 4 A). Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures ( Walls et al., 2020 69. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicate that the side chains of D614 and T859 of the neighboring protomer ( Figure 4 B) form a between-protomer hydrogen bond, bringing together a residue from the S 1 unit of one protomer and a residue of the S 2 unit of the other protomer ( Figure 4 C). The change to G614 would eliminate this side-chain hydrogen bond, possibly increasing main-chain flexibility and altering between-protomer interactions. In addition, this substitution could modulate glycosylation at the nearby N616 site, influence the dynamics of the spatially proximal fusion peptide ( Figure 4 D) of the neighboring protomer, or have other effects.
SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 999 individuals presenting with COVID-19 disease at the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust were available and linked to clinical data. The Sheffield data include age, sex, date of sampling, hospitalization status (defined as outpatient [OP], inpatient [IP], requiring hospitalization, or admittance to the intensive care unit [ICU]), and the cycle threshold (Ct) for a positive signal in E-gene based RT-PCR. The Ct is used here as a surrogate for relative viral loads; lower Ct values indicate higher viral loads ( Corman et al., 2020 10. Corman, V.M. ∙ Landt, O. ∙ Kaiser, M. ... Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR Euro Surveill. 2020; 25 :2000045 Crossref Scopus (5181) PubMed Google Scholar ), but not all viral nucleic acids represent infectious viral particles. RT-PCR methods changed during the course of the study because of limited availability of testing kits. The first method involved nucleic acid extraction and the second method heat treatment ( Fomsgaard and Rosenstierne, 2020 20. Fomsgaard, A.S. ∙ Rosenstierne, M.W. An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 - escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage, Copenhagen, Denmark, March 2020 Euro Surveill. 2020; 25 :2000398 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). A generalized linear model (GLM) used to predict the PCR Ct based on the RT-PCR method, sex, age, and D614G status showed only the RT-PCR method (p < 2e−16) and D614G status (p = 0.037) to be statistically significant ( Figure 5 A). Lower Ct values were observed in G614 infections. While our paper was in revision, G614-variant association with low Ct values in vivo ( Figure 5 ) was reported independently by two other groups ( Lorenzo-Redondo et al., 2020 43. Lorenzo-Redondo, R. ∙ Nam, H.H. ∙ Roberts, S.C. ...

Comparing viral load and clinical outcomes in Washington State across D614G mutation in spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 https://github.com/blab/ncov-D614G Date: 2020 Google Scholar ) in preprints that have not yet been peer reviewed.
We found no significant association between D614G status and disease severity as measured by hospitalization outcomes. A comparison of D614G status and hospitalization (combining IP and ICU) was not significant (p = 0.66, Fisher’s exact test), although comparing ICU admission with IP and OP did have borderline significance (p = 0.047) ( Figure 5 B). Regression analysis reinforced the result that G614 status was not associated with greater levels of hospitalization but that higher age ( Dowd et al., 2020 17. Dowd, J.B. ∙ Andriano, L. ∙ Brazel, D.M. ... Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Further analysis showed that viral load was not masking a potential D614G status effect on hospitalization ( STAR Methods ). Univariate analysis also found highly significant associations between age and male sex and hospitalization ( STAR Methods ).
We quantified the infectious titers of pseudotyped single-cycle vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and lentiviral particles displaying D614 or G614 SARS-CoV2 Spike protein. For the VSV and lentiviral pseudotypes, G614-bearing viruses had significantly higher infectious titers (2.6- to 9.3-fold increase) than their D614 counterparts; this was confirmed in multiple cell types ( Figures 6 A–6C). Similar results, reported recently in a preprint that has not yet been peer reviewed, also suggest that G614 increases Spike stability and membrane incorporation ( Zhang et al., 2020 83. Zhang, L. ∙ Jackson, C.B. ∙ Mou, H. ...

TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 promote SARS-CoV-2 infection of human small intestinal enterocytes Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 eabc3582 Crossref Scopus (722) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spike 614 is in a pocket adjacent to the fusion peptide near the expected TMPRSS2 cleavage site, suggesting that there could be differences in the propensity and/or requirement for TMPRSS2 of the G614 variant. To test this hypothesis, we infected 293T cells stably expressing the ACE2 receptor in the presence or absence of TMPRSS2 and quantified the titer of infectious virus. We found similar fold changes in titers between D614 and G614 regardless of TMPRSS2 expression ( Figure 6 A). Hence, entry of G614-bearing viruses into 293T-ACE2 cells compared with D614-bearing viruses is not enhanced by TMPRSS2. Further studies are required to determine whether the G614 variant shows increased titers in lung cells, which may recapitulate native protease expression levels more faithfully, and to determine whether this variant increases the fitness of authentic SARS-CoV-2.
We also tested whether the D614G variations would be similarly neutralized by a polyclonal antibody. Convalescent sera of six San Diego residents, likely infected in early to mid-March 2020, when D614 and G614 were circulating, demonstrate equivalent or better neutralization of a G614-bearing pseudovirus compared with a D614-bearing pseudovirus ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Although we do not know with which virus each of these individuals were infected, these initial data suggest that, despite increased fitness in cell culture, G614-bearing virions are not intrinsically more resistant to neutralization by convalescent sera.
Spike has very few mutations overall. A small set has reached 0.3% or more of the global population sample, the threshold for automatic tracking at the https://cov.lanl.gov website ( Figures 7 A and 7B; details are provided in Table S2 ). Regions in the alignment where entropy is relatively high compared with the rest of Spike (i.e., local clusters of rare mutations) are also tracked ( Table S2 ). Genetic mutations of interest are mapped as amino acid changes onto a Spike structure ( Figure 4 ). The mutation resulting in the signal peptide L5F change recurs many times in the tree and is stably maintained in about 0.6% of the global GISAID data. There are several clusters of mutations in the region of the Spike gene encoding the N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD that are potential targets for neutralizing antibodies ( Chen et al., 2017 6.

The RBD cluster (positives 475–483) spans two positions, 475 and 476, that are located within 4 Å of bound ACE2 ( Figure 4 D; Yan et al., 2020 77. Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; 367 :1444-1448 Crossref Scopus (3652) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fusion peptide contains a cluster of amino acid changes between 826–839; this cluster is highlighted in Figure 7 to illustrate our web-based tools for tracking variation ( Figures 7 A–7C). The fusion core of HR1 ( Xia et al., 2020 76. Xia, S. ∙ Liu, M. ∙ Wang, C. ...

The motif SXSS (937–940) may enhance the association of helices ( Dawson et al., 2002 13. Dawson, J.P. ∙ Weinger, J.S. ∙ Engelman, D.M.

Section: Discussion

Our data show that, over the course of 1 month, the variant carrying the D614G Spike mutation became the globally dominant form of SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants at Nextstrain reveals complex webs of evolutionary and geographical relationships ( https://nextstrain.org ; Hadfield et al., 2018 28. Hadfield, J. ∙ Megill, C. ∙ Bell, S.M. ... Nextstrain: real-time tracking of pathogen evolution Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4121-4123 Crossref Scopus (1872) PubMed Google Scholar ); travelers globally dispersed G614 variants and likely would have introduced and reintroduced G614 variants into different locations. Still, D614 prevalent epidemics were very well established in many locations when G614 first began to appear (see Figure S2 for examples). The mutation that causes the D614G amino change is transmitted as part of a conserved haplotype defined by 4 mutations that almost always track together ( Figures S5 and S6 ). The pattern of increasing G614 frequency within many different populations where D614 and G614 were co-circulating is highly significant, suggesting that G614 may be under positive selection ( Figures 1 B and 3 ). We also found G614 to be associated with higher levels of viral nucleic acid in the upper respiratory tract in human patients ( Figure 5 ), suggestive of higher viral loads, and with higher infectivity in multiple pseudotyping assays ( Figure 6 ).
Given that most G614 variants belong to the G clade lineage, phylogenetic methods that depend on recurrence of mutational events for their signal are poorly powered to resolve whether D614G is under positive selection. The GISAID data, however, provided the opportunity to look into the relationships among the SARS-CoV-2 variants in the context of time and geography, enabling us to track the increase in frequency of G614 as an early indicator of possible positive selection. This approach is potentially subject to founder effects and sampling biases, and so we generally view this strategy as simply an early indicator of an amino acid change that should be monitored further and tested. The G614 variant stood out, however, in our early detection framework for several reasons. First was the consistency of increase across geographic regions, which was highly significantly non-random ( Figures 1 B and 3 ). Second, if the two forms were equally likely to propagate, then one would expect the D614 form to persist in many locations where the G614 form was introduced into the ongoing well-established D614 epidemics. Instead, we found that, even in such cases, G614 increased ( Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , S2 , and S3 ). Third, the increase in G614 frequency often continued well after national stay-at-home orders were in place, when serial reseeding from travelers was likely to be reduced significantly ( Figures 2 , S2 , and S3 ).
Our global tracking data show that the G614 variant in Spike has spread faster than D614. We interpret this to mean that the virus is likely to be more infectious, a hypothesis consistent with the higher infectivity observed with G614 Spike-pseudotyped viruses we observed in vitro ( Figure 6 ) and the G614 variant association with higher patient Ct values, indicative of potentially higher in vivo viral loads ( Figure 5 ). Interestingly, we did not find evidence of G614 effects on disease severity; i.e., it was not significantly associated with hospitalization status. However, an association between the G614 variant and higher fatality rates has been reported in a comparison of mortality rates across countries, although this kind of analysis can be complicated by different availability of testing and care in different nations ( Becerra-Flores and Cardozo, 2020 2. Becerra-Flores, M. ∙ Cardozo, T. SARS-CoV-2 viral spike G614 mutation exhibits higher case fatality rate Int. J. Clin. Pract. 2020; Published online May 6, 2020 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although higher infectiousness of the G614 variant may fully account for its rapid spread and persistence, other factors should also be considered. These include epidemiological factors because viral spread also depends on whom it infects, and epidemiological influences can also cause changes in genotype frequency to mimic evolutionary pressures. In all likelihood, a combination of evolutionary selection for G614 and the founder’s effects of being introduced into highly mobile and connected populations may have together contributed, in part, to its rise. The G-clade mutations in the 5′ UTR or in the RdRP protein might also have effects. In addition, there could be immunological consequences resulting from the G614 change in Spike. The G614 variant is sensitive to neutralization by polyclonal convalescent serum ( Figure 5 ), which is encouraging in terms of immune interventions, but it will be important to determine whether the D614 and G614 forms of SARS-CoV-2 are differentially sensitive to neutralization by vaccine-elicited antibodies or by antibodies produced in response to infection with either form of the virus. Also, if the G614 variant is indeed more infectious than the D614 form ( Figure 6 ), then it may require higher antibody levels for protection by vaccines or antibody therapeutic agents than the D614 form. Antibodies against an immunodominant linear epitope spanning Spike 614 in SARS-CoV-1 were associated with ADE activity ( Wang et al., 2016 72. Wang, Q. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Kuwahara, K. ... Immunodominant SARS Coronavirus Epitopes in Humans Elicited both Enhancing and Neutralizing Effects on Infection in Non-human Primates ACS Infect. Dis. 2016; 2 :361-376 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ), and so it is possible that this mutation may affect ADE.
Tracking mutations in the Spike gene has been our primary focus to date because of its relevance to vaccine and antibody-based therapy strategies currently under development. Such interventions take months to years to develop. For the sake of efficiency, contemporary variation should be factored in during development to ensure that the interventions will be effective against circulating variants when they are eventually deployed. To this end, we built a data analysis pipeline to enable exploration of potentially interesting mutations on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The analysis is updated daily as the data become available through GISAID, enabling experimentalists to make use of the most current data available to inform vaccine development, reagents for evaluating antibody response, and experimental design. The speed with which the G614 variant became the dominant form globally suggests a need for continued vigilance.
Shifts in frequency toward the G614 variant in any given geographic region could, in principle, result from founder effects or sampling biases; it was the consistency of this pattern across regions where both forms of the virus were initially co-circulating that led us to suggest that the G614 form might be transmitted more readily because of an intrinsic fitness advantage; however, systematic biases across many regions could affect the levels of significance we observed. The lack of association between G614 and hospitalization we report may miss effects on disease severity that are more subtle than we can detect. The experimental approach taken here to acquire laboratory evidence of increased fitness of the D614G mutation is based on two different pseudovirus models of infection in established cell lines. The extent to which this model faithfully recapitulates wild-type virus infection in natural target cells of the respiratory system is still being determined, and our laboratory experiments do not directly address the biology and mechanics of natural transmission. Infectiousness and transmissibility are not always synonymous, and more studies are needed to determine whether the D614G mutation actually led to an increase in number of infections and not just higher viral loads during infection. We encourage others to study this phenomenon in greater detail with a wild-type virus in natural infection and varied target cells ( Hou et al., 2020 32. Hou, Y.J. ∙ Okuda, K. ∙ Edwards, C.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Genetics Reveals a Variable Infection Gradient in the Respiratory Tract Cell. 2020; Published online May 27, 2020 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1033) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in relevant animal models. Finally, the neutralization assays performed were based on sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with an unknown D614G status. Thus, although they show that the G614 variants are neutralization sensitive, more work is needed to resolve whether the potency of neutralization is affected when the variant that initiated the immune response differs from the test variant or when monoclonal antibodies are used.

999 individuals presenting with active COVID-19 disease were sampled for SARS CoV-2 sequencing at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK using samples collected for routine clinical diagnostic use. This work was performed under approval by the Public Health England Research Ethics and Governance Group for the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium (R&D NR0195). SARS-CoV-2 sequences were generated using samples taken for routine clinical diagnostic use from 999 individuals presenting with active COVID-19 disease: 593 female, 399 male, 6 no gender specified; ages 15-103 (median 55) years.
Samples for PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 5 A) were all obtained from either throat or combined nose/throat swabs. Nucleic acid was extracted from 200μl of sample on MagnaPure96 extraction platform (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Burgess Hill, UK). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using primers and probes targeting the E gene and the RdRp genes for routine clinical diagnostic purposes, with thermocycling and fluorescence detection on ABI Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, United States) using previously described primer and probe sets ( Corman et al., 2020 10. Corman, V.M. ∙ Landt, O. ∙ Kaiser, M. ... Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR Euro Surveill. 2020; 25 :2000045 Crossref Scopus (5181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nucleic acid from positive cases underwent long-read whole genome sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK) using the ARTIC network protocol (accessed the 19 th of April; https://artic.network/ncov-2019 ) Following base calling, data were demultiplexed using ONT Guppy using a high accuracy model. Reads were filtered based on quality and length (400 to 700bp), then mapped to the Wuhan reference genome and primer sites trimmed. Reads were then downsampled to 200x coverage in each direction. Variants were called using nanopolish ( https://github.com/jts/nanopolish ) and used to determine changes from the reference. Consensus sequences were constructed using reference and variants called.
Plasmids for full-length SARS-Cov-2 Spike were generated from synthetic codon-optimized DNA (Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, GenBank: MN908947.3) through sub-cloning into the pHCMV3 expression vector, with a stop codon included prior to the HA tag. The D614G variant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Positive clones were fully sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations were introduced.
Lentiviruses for stable cell line production were generated by seeding 293T cells at a density of 1x10 6 cells/well in a 6-well dish. Once the cells reached confluency, they were transfected with 2ug pCaggs-VSV-G, 2ug of lentiviral packaging vector pSPAX2, and 2ug of lentiviral expression plasmid pCW62 encoding ACE2-V5 and the puromycin resistance gene (pCW62-ACE2.V5-PuroR) or TMPRSS2-FLAG and the blasticidin resistance gene (pCW62-TMPRSS2.FLAG-BlastR) using Trans-IT transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions. 24 hours post-transfection, media was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and 20mM HEPES. 48 hours post-transfection, supernatants were collected and filtered using a 0.45um syringe filter (VWR Catalog #28200-026).
293T-ACE2 cells were generated by seeding 293T cells at a density of 1x10 6 cells/well in a 6-well dish. At confluency, cells were transduced with 100uL of ACE2.V5-PuroR lentivirus. 48 hours post-transduction, cells were placed under 5ug/ml puromycin. 293T-ACE2+TMPRSS2 cells were generated by seeding 293T-ACE2 cells at a density of 1x10 6 cells/well in a 6-well dish. At confluency, cells were transduced with 100uL of TMPRSS2.FLAG-BlastR lentivirus. 48 hours post-transduction, cells were placed under 10ug/ml blasticidin selection.
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2-pseduotyped VSV-ΔG-GFP were generated by transfecting 293T cells with phCMV3 expressing the indicated version of codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 Spike using TransIT according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 hr post-transfection, the medium was removed, and cells were infected with rVSV-G pseudotyped ΔG-GFP parent virus (VSV-G ∗ ΔG-GFP) at MOI = 2 for 2 hours with rocking. The virus was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with OPTI-MEM containing 2% FBS (OPTI-2) before fresh OPTI-2 was added. Supernatants containing rVSV-SARS-2 were removed 24 hours post-infection and clarified by centrifugation.
Viral titrations were performed by seeding cells in 96-well plates at a density sufficient to produce a monolayer at the time of infection. Then, 10-fold serial dilutions of pseudovirus were made and added to cells in triplicate wells. Infection was allowed to proceed for 12-16 hr at 37°C. The cells were then fixed with 4% PFA, washed two times with 1xPBS and stained with Hoescht (1ug/mL in PBS). After two additional washes with PBS, pseudovirus titers were quantified as the number of fluorescent forming units (ffu/mL) using a CellInsight CX5 imager (ThermoScientific) and automated enumeration of cells expressing GFP.
Additional assessments of corresponding D614 and G614 Spike pseudotyped viruses were performed by using lentiviral vectors and infection in 293T/ACE2.MF and TZM-bl/ACE2.MF cells (both cell lines kindly provided by Drs. Mike Farzan and Huihui Mu at Scripps). Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% Pen Strep and 3 ug/ml puromycin. An expression plasmid encoding codon-optimized full-length spike of the Wuhan-1 strain (VRC7480), was provided by Drs. Barney Graham and Kizzmekia Corbett at the Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health (USA). The D614G amino acid change was introduced into VRC7480 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent Technologies (Catalog # 210518). The mutation was confirmed by full-length spike gene sequencing. Pseudovirions were produced in HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC cat. no. CRL-11268) by transfection using Fugene 6 (Promega Cat#E2692). Pseudovirions for 293T/ACE2 infection were produced by co-transfection with a lentiviral backbone (pCMV ΔR8.2) and firefly luciferase reporter gene (pHR’ CMV Luc) ( Naldini et al., 1996 48. Naldini, L. ∙ Blömer, U. ∙ Gage, F.H. ... Efficient transfer, integration, and sustained long-term expression of the transgene in adult rat brains injected with a lentiviral vector Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93 :11382-11388 Crossref Scopus (1301) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pseudovirions for TZM-bl/ACE2 infection were produced by co-transfection with the Env-deficient lentiviral backbone pSG3ΔEnv (kindly provided by Drs Beatrice Hahn and Feng Gao). Culture supernatants from transfections were clarified of cells by low-speed centrifugation and filtration (0.45 μm filter) and used immediately for infection in 96-well culture plates. 293T/ACE2.MF cells were preseeded at 5,000 cells per well in 96-well black/white culture plates (Perkin-Elmer Catalog # 6005060) one day prior to infection. Sixteen wells were inoculated with 50 ul of a 1:10-dilution of each pseudovirus and incubated for three days. Luminescence was measured using the Promega Luciferase Assay System (Catalog # E1501). For infection of TZM-bl/ACE2.MF cells, 10,000 freshly trypsinized cells were added to 16 wells of a 96-well clear culture plate (Fisher Scientific) and inoculated with undiluted pseudovirus. Luminescence was measured after 2 days in a solid black plate using the Britelite Plus Reporter Gene Assay System (Perkin-Elmer). Luminescence in both assays was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Model Victor2 luminometer. HIV-1 p24 content (produced by the backbone vectors) was quantified using the Alliance p24 ELISA Kit (PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Cat# NEK050B001KT). Reported relative luminescence units (RLUs) were adjusted for p24 content.
Pre-titrated amounts of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 (D614 or G614 variant) were incubated with serially diluted human sera at 37°C for 1 hr before addition to confluent Vero monolayers in 96-well plates. Infection proceeded for 12-16 hr at 37°C in 5% CO 2 before cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1ug/mL Hoescht. Cells were imaged using a CellInsight CX5 imager and infection was quantitated by automated enumeration of total cells and those expressing GFP. Infection was normalized to the percent cells infected with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 incubated with normal human sera. Data are presented as the relative neutralization for each concentration of sera.

Shu, Y. ∙ McCauley, J. GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data - from vision to reality Euro Surveill. 2017; 22 :30494 Crossref Scopus (1757) PubMed Google Scholar ) has been coordinating SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence submissions and making data available for download since early in the pandemic. At time of this writing, hundreds of sequences were being added every day. These sequences result from extraordinary efforts by a wide variety of institutions and individuals: while an invaluable resource, but are mixed in quality. The complete sequence download includes a large number of partial sequences, with variable coverage, and extensive ‘N’ runs in many sequences. To assemble a high-quality dataset for mutational analysis, we constructed a data pipeline using some off-the-shelf bioinformatic tools and a small amount of custom code.
From theSARS-CoV-2 sequences available from GISAID, we derived a “clean” codon-aligned dataset comprising near-complete viral genomes, without large insertions or deletions (“indels”) or runs of undetermined or ambiguous bases. For convenience in mutation assessment, we generated a codon-based nucleotide multiple sequence alignment, and extracted translations of each reading frame, from which we generated lists of mutations. The cleaning process was in general a process of deletion, with alignment of retained sequences; the following criteria were used to exclude sequences: 1 Fragmented matching (> 20 nt gap in match to reference) 2 Gaps at 5′ or 3′ end (> 3 nt) 3 High numbers of mismatched nucleotides (> 20), ‘N’ or other ambiguous IUPAC codes. 4 Regions with concentrated ambiguity calls: > 10 in any 50 nt window)
Any sequence matching any of the above criteria was excluded in its entirety.
Sequences were mapped to a reference (bases 266:29674 of GenBank entry NC_045512; i.e., the first base of the ORF1ab start codon to the last base of the ORF10 stop codon) using “nucmer” from the MUMmer package (version 3.23; Kurtz et al., 2004 36. Kurtz, S. ∙ Phillippy, A. ∙ Delcher, A.L. ... Versatile and open software for comparing large genomes Genome Biol. 2004; 5 :R12 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The nucmer output “delta” file was parsed directly using custom Perl code to partition sequences into the various exclusion categories (Sequence Mapping Table) and to construct a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The MSA was refined using code derived from the Los Alamos HIV database “Gene Cutter” tool code base. At this stage, alignment columns comprising an insertion of a single “N” in a single sequence (generating a frameshift) were deleted, and gaps were shifted to conform with codon boundaries.
Using the initial “good-sequence” alignment, a low-effort parsimony tree was constructed. Initially, trees were built using PAUP ∗ ( Swofford, 2003 63. Swofford, D.L. PAUP ∗ {Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other Methods)], Version 4 PAUP ∗ Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony Sinauer Associates, 2003 Google Scholar ) with a single replicate heuristic search using stepwise random sequence addition; subsequently, a parsimony ratchet was added; currently, oblong ( Goloboff, 2014 23. Goloboff, P.A. Oblong, a program to analyse phylogenomic data sets with millions of characters, requiring negligible amounts of RAM Cladistics. 2014; 30 :273-281 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ) is used. Sequences in the alignment were sorted vertically to correspond to the (ladderized) tree, and reference-sequence reading frames were added. See Figure S1 for a pipeline schematic.
Alignments were made and trees inferred for three distinct data partitions, the longer the alignments, the fewer sequences the sequences ( Figure S1 .) The full genome tree was used for Figure 7 . Trees were inferred by either of two methods: 1. neighbor-joining using a p-distance criterion, ( Swofford, 2003 63. Swofford, D.L. PAUP ∗ {Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other Methods)], Version 4 PAUP ∗ Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony Sinauer Associates, 2003 Google Scholar ) or 2. parsimony heuristic search using a version of the parsimony ratchet ( Goloboff, 2014 23. Goloboff, P.A. Oblong, a program to analyse phylogenomic data sets with millions of characters, requiring negligible amounts of RAM Cladistics. 2014; 30 :273-281 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ), the general conclusions in Figure 7 were substantiated in both; the parsimony tree is shown.

To observe a significant change in the frequency of two SARS-CoV-2 variants in a geographic region, three minimal requirements must be met. Both variants must have been introduced into an area and be co-circulating, data must be sampled for a long enough period to observe a change in frequency, and there must be enough data to be powered adequately to detect a difference.
We use the bioinformatic approaches described above to extract from GISAID all the politically defined geographic regions within the data that met these criteria, to track changes in frequency in a systematic way using all available data. The political/geographical regions we use are strictly hierarchically segmented based on the naming conventions used in GISAID. GISAID data is labeled such that the geographic source is noted first as a continent or Oceania; we call this Level 1. Level 2 is the country of origin of a sample. Level 3 are subcountries and states, and although occasionally level 3 includes a major city in a small country. For this purpose, England, Scotland, and Wales are considered sub-countries of the United Kingdom, and assigned level 3; the sampling in the UK has been the most extensive globally to date. Level 4, is the county or city of origin. The levels are strictly hierarchical, and within a given level, the geographical regions do not overlap. In some cases (e.g., Nepal_Kathmandu and Nepal, Greece_Athens and Greece, Italy_Veneto_Verona and Italy_Veneto, or Iceland_Reykjavik and Iceland) the sampling in a sub-level exactly matches the sampling in the corresponding upper level, in which case the sub-level is not presented. Levels 3 and 4 are not always available, and the day of sampling is also not always available.
The statistical strategies we use are then applied separately in each country, region or city, and we do not assume that outbreaks in each political subdivision are independent and identically distributed. Instead, our model assumption is that the individuals we test within a region are independent. This assumption may fail if there are sampling biases in a region that change over a given period of time. The G614 form is part of the G clade haplotype that is introduced by travelers, as we discuss in the text, and it is rare for it to arise independently. Our null hypothesis is that the observed shifts in frequency are random nondirectional drift. We have taken two statistical approaches to test this.
For this comparison, we used a two-sided Fisher’s exact test to compare the G614 and D614 counts in the pre-onset and the post-delay periods, as described in the text, and provides a p value against the null hypothesis that the fraction of D614 and G614 sequences did not change. To be included in the analysis, 15 sequences were required pre-onset, with a mixture of D614 and G614 present such that the rarer form was present at least 3 times; we also required a minimum of 15 sequences be sampled at least 2 weeks later, to create a post-delay set. Only regions for which p < 0.05 are considered, based on a two sided-test. We then use a binomial test to evaluate the null hypothesis that in regions where we saw significant change in sampling frequency over time, the shift was as likely to be an increase or a decrease in G614 across geographic regions. This analysis is presented in Figure 1 B.
Isotonic regression forms the basis of a one-sided test of the hypothesis for positive selection based on fitting the indicator that the typed strain is G as a logistic regression in which the logarithm of the odds ratio is a non-decreasing function of time. We use the residual deviance of the fitted model as our test statistics. To be included in this analysis, a region was required to have at least 5 sequences each of D614 and G614, and a minimum of 14 sampling days of data available. While we have a composite null hypothesis (the log-odds ratio is non-increasing), assuming that the log-odds ratio remains constant over time leads to tests that have largest power. While the classical chi-square approximation does not hold, we can sample from the constant log-odds ratio by permuting the vector of variant labels, and refitting the isotonic logistic regression. We performed 400 randomizations of the data in each region. Hence the lowest p value we can obtain is 0.0025. The reverse hypothesis, namely than the fraction of G variant decreases with time is also tested by fitting a non-increasing function of time. The isotonic logistic regression was done using R and the cgam package. We applied the bionomial test across regions with a significant change in one direction, as we did for the Fisher's test results. This analysis is presented in Figure 3 and Data S1 .
Univariate analysis showed no associations between the age of individuals and their D614 (median 54.8, IR 39.4-77) or G614 status (median 54.6 (38.7-72.8) (Wilcoxon rank sum p = 0.37), nor with D614 and G614 and sex (Fisher’s exact p = 0.32). Comparing hospitalization and age, the median (IR) are: for all hospitalized, (IP+OCU), 74 years (59-83); for all OP, 44 (32-54), Wilcoxon p < 2.2e-16.
67% of males were hospitalized, versus 33% of females (Fisher’s exact p = p value < 2.2e-16).
Two PCR Ct methods were used as a surrogate for estimating in vivo viral load in the upper respiratory tract, switching methods in mid-April due a shortage of kits. The first method involved nucleic acid extraction; the second method, heat treatment ( Fomsgaard and Rosenstierne, 2020 20. Fomsgaard, A.S. ∙ Rosenstierne, M.W. An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 - escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage, Copenhagen, Denmark, March 2020 Euro Surveill. 2020; 25 :2000398 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To assess the impact of available clinical parameters on viral load as measured by PCR Cts, we used a linear model, predicting Ct from PCR method, Sex, Age and D614G variant. This revealed that only the PCR method and the D614G variant were statistically significant. A negative coefficient for the G variant indicated that patients infected by the latter have, on average, a higher viral load, but that that viral load is not impacted by neither age nor sex.
The results from the smaller model are:
Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(> |t|) (Intercept) 24.301 0.3166 76.757 < 2e-16 ∗∗∗ G614 −0.7763 0.3718 −2.088 0.037 ∗ Method_2 3.1979 0.3658 8.743 < 2e-16
Results comparing D614G status for the two methods were also evaluated independently, and the first method showed a significant association between lower Ct values and presence of G614 (Wilcoxon p = 0.033), but the second method, with many fewer samples, did not reach significance.
The simple Fisher’s exact test analysis in Figure 5 indicates that the D614G status is not predictive of hospitalization, even though it is predictive of viral load. We can make a first analysis to predict hospitalization from viral load, gender, age and D614G status:
Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(> |z|) (Intercept) −7.548823 0.624270 −12.092 < 2e-16 ∗∗∗ G614 0.112038 0.214107 0.523 0.600779 Male 1.490789 0.181695 8.205 2.31e-16 ∗∗∗ Age 0.089444 0.005664 15.791 < 2e-16 ∗∗∗ CT 0.069376 0.018243 3.803 0.000143 ∗∗∗ Method_2 −0.358397 0.218856 −1.638 0.101506
As somewhat expected, the D614G status is not statistically significant, even though viral load is, but the coefficient goes in the opposite direction than we would have intuited: a lower viral load is predictive of a higher probability of hospitalization. Sex (Male) and Age both increase the probability of hospitalization.
Although the above analysis indicates that aa614G does not predict hospitalization directly, it does predict viral load and viral load predicts hospitalization; so there is a concern that aa614G might affect hospitalization, but that this effect is “masked” by the viral load. To explore this hypothesis, we “unmask” the aa614G by using the residuals from the regression of Ct on extraction method and D614G status to get a second predictive model for hospitalization:
Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(> |z|) (Intercept) −5.889991 0.393950 −14.951 < 2e-16 ∗∗∗ G614 0.029858 0.209349 0.143 0.886587 Corrected Ct 0.069276 0.018225 3.801 0.000144 ∗∗∗ Male 1.490690 0.181584 8.209 2.22e-16 ∗∗∗ Age 0.089714 0.005661 15.849 < 2e-16 ∗∗∗
In these regression analyses, the estimated coefficients for age, sex and viral load (corrected or not for method and strain) remain mostly unchanged, and strain still does not have an effect.
All other comparisons were not significant. All coding was done using R. Results of these analysis are presented in the main text and in Figure 5 .
We used a log-normal generalized linear model (GLM) to test whether the G614 variant grew to higher titers than the wild-type D614 virus in Vero, 293T-ACE2 and 293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cell lines. The full experiment was repeated twice, each time in triplicate, and the 2 experimental repeats were considered random effects. Viral variant and cell line were considered as fixed effects. On average, across all cell lines, G614 grows to about a 3-fold (2.95) higher titer than D614 (p = 9x10 −11 ). A significant interaction was found between viral variant and cell line (p = 0.002), indicating that the relative increase of G614 compared to D614 was significantly different across cell lines (p = 0.002).
Results of these analysis are presented in Figure 6 A.
We discovered a sequencing processing error that gave rise to what appeared at first to be a mutation of interest at position 943 (24389 A > C and 24390 C > G) in Spike that was evident in sequences from Belgium. It was frequent enough to be a site of interest, and was tracked. We contacted the group in Belgium, the source of the data, who were already aware of the issue, concurred with our interpretation, and they had been in touch with GISAID with a request to remove the problematic sequences.
We identified the issue with this site as part of another study using a method to detect systematic sequencing errors ( Freeman et al., 2020 21. Freeman, T.M. ∙ Wang, D. ∙ Harris, J., Genomics England Research Consortium Genomic loci susceptible to systematic sequencing bias in clinical whole genomes Genome Res. 2020; 30 :415-426 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ); we are interrogating the quality of available sequencing
data and these positions were highlighted as suspect. We interrogated these positions in the raw sequencing data from Sheffield, and although these two variants are not present in the final consensus sequence from any of the Sheffield isolates, the raw, untrimmed bam files show their presence in only one of the amplicons covering the site ( Figure S7 A and S7B). We noticed that in fact this position is to the left of the 5′ primer of amplicon 81 in what we believe to be an adaptor sequence. Comparison of the Wuhan reference and the adaptor sequence reveals similarity around this position:
Nanopore adaptor sequence: CAGCACCTT
The Wuhan reference sequence: CAGCAAGTT
In our validation set, we see a C present at around 50% of called bases at both these positions in raw data but this region is trimmed by the ARTIC pipeline and is therefore not used to call variants and contribute to the final consensus sequence. Although it is evident in amplicon 81, in this region, there is no evidence for these variants in the data from amplicon 80, which also covers these positions. We include a figure ( Figure S7 ) to explain our finding.
In summary this is an error that has arisen due to a combination of improper trimming of adaptor and primer regions from raw sequencing reads before downstream analysis, and the coincidental homology between the nanopore adaptor sequence and the Wuhan reference genome in this region. This is included here as a cautionary note; resolving rare biological mutations and sequencing error will be an important balance going forward in terms of interpretation of rare mutations ( De Maio et al., 2020 14. De Maio, N. ∙ Walker, C. ∙ Borges, R. ... Issues with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473 Date: 2020 Google Scholar ). A recurrent amino acid change like L5F ( Figure 7 ) could potentially result from a recurrent sequencing or sequence processing error ( De Maio et al., 2020 14. De Maio, N. ∙ Walker, C. ∙ Borges, R. ... Issues with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473 Date: 2020 Google Scholar ), or alternatively, it may be of particular interest if it is naturally recurring homoplasy.
