Title: Senescence-Induced Vascular Remodeling Creates Therapeutic Vulnerabilities in Pancreas Cancer


Abstract: Summary

KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a desmoplastic response that promotes hypovascularity, immunosuppression, and resistance to chemo- and immunotherapies. We show that a combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors that target KRAS-directed oncogenic signaling can suppress PDAC proliferation through induction of retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated senescence. In preclinical mouse models of PDAC, this senescence-inducing therapy produces a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that includes pro-angiogenic factors that promote tumor vascularization, which in turn enhances drug delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic gemcitabine chemotherapy. In addition, SASP-mediated endothelial cell activation stimulates the accumulation of CD8 + T cells into otherwise immunologically “cold” tumors, sensitizing tumors to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Therefore, in PDAC models, therapy-induced senescence can establish emergent susceptibilities to otherwise ineffective chemo- and immunotherapies through SASP-dependent effects on the tumor vasculature and immune system.

Section: Introduction

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) conveys a dismal prognosis ( Siegel et al., 2019 95. Siegel, R.L. ∙ Miller, K.D. ∙ Jemal, A. Cancer statistics, 2019 CA Cancer J. Clin. 2019; 69 :7-34 Crossref Scopus (5520) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is refractory to chemo- and immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade that has revolutionized the treatment landscape of other tumors ( Ribas and Wolchok, 2018; Royal et al., 2010 81.

This treatment-refractory behavior likely results from the unique characteristics of PDAC, which arises through perturbations in a combination of undruggable cancer drivers, including mutations in the KRAS oncogene and disruption of the TP53 , SMAD4 , and CDKN2A tumor suppressors ( Morris et al., 2010 63.

Cancer. 2010; 10 :683-695 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the disease evolves within a heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by a fibro-inflammatory stroma that contributes to disease progression ( Ligorio et al., 2019; Öhlund et al., 2017 54.

Indeed, several strategies have targeted aspects of the PDAC TME to improve drug uptake ( Chauhan et al., 2013; Olive et al., 2009; Provenzano et al., 2012 15.

KRAS mutations occur in over 90% of human PDAC, and mouse models implicate oncogenic KRAS in initiating and maintaining tumorigenesis as well as the stromal changes that accompany disease progression ( Collins et al., 2012a, 2012b; Kapoor et al., 2014 20.

Yap1 activation enables bypass of oncogenic Kras addiction in pancreatic cancer Cell. 2014; 158 :185-197 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar ). While pharmacological efforts to directly target KRAS or its downstream effectors have proven largely ineffective to date, combinatorial strategies for inhibiting RAS pathway components and interfering with compensatory or negative feedback signaling have shown promise in preclinical studies ( Manchado et al., 2016; Okumura and Jänne, 2014; Sun et al., 2014 58.

Recently, we demonstrated that one of these targeted therapy combinations—the MEK inhibitor trametinib and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib—could lead to durable cell-cycle exit of KRAS mutant lung and pancreas cancer cells through induction of retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated cellular senescence ( Ruscetti et al., 2018 85.

NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination Science. 2018; 362 :1416-1422 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cellular senescence is a physiological stress-response that results in the proliferative arrest and immune-mediated clearance of damaged and pre-malignant cells, seemingly as a part of a wound healing process that facilitates tissue regeneration after injury ( Demaria et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2011; Krizhanovsky et al., 2008; Mosteiro et al., 2016 25.

Mosteiro, L. ∙ Pantoja, C. ∙ Alcazar, N. ... Tissue damage and senescence provide critical signals for cellular reprogramming in vivo Science. 2016; 354 :aaf4445 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Senescence can be triggered by oncogenic signaling, including by mutant KRAS in pre-malignant lesions such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) ( Caldwell et al., 2012 12. Caldwell, M.E. ∙ DeNicola, G.M. ∙ Martins, C.P. ... Cellular features of senescence during the evolution of human and murine ductal pancreatic cancer Oncogene. 2012; 31 :1599-1608 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus serving as a natural barrier to malignancy. The CDKN2A/RB and p53 tumor suppressor programs collaborate to regulate this process, and their disruption can disable senescence and facilitate cancer initiation and progression, including in PDAC ( Bardeesy et al., 2006; Carrière et al., 2011; Morton et al., 2010; Serrano et al., 1997 5.

Two key molecular modules involved in senescence are an RB-dependent program that produces a repressive chromatin state to transcriptionally silence many pro-proliferative genes ( Chicas et al., 2010; Narita et al., 2003 16. Chicas, A. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Zhang, C. ...

Control of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype by NF-κB promotes senescence and enhances chemosensitivity Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :2125-2136 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar 51.

BRD4 Connects Enhancer Remodeling to Senescence Immune Surveillance Cancer Discov. 2016; 6 :612-629 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This latter component is often referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and is characterized by the secretion of chemokines, cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and other paracrine signaling factors ( Coppé et al., 2008; Kuilman and Peeper, 2009 23. Coppé, J.P. ∙ Patil, C.K. ∙ Rodier, F. ... Senescence-associated secretory phenotypes reveal cell-nonautonomous functions of oncogenic RAS and the p53 tumor suppressor PLoS Biol. 2008; 6 :2853-2868 Crossref Scopus (1689) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Kuilman, T. ∙ Peeper, D.S. Senescence-messaging secretome: SMS-ing cellular stress Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9 :81-94 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the pleiotropic nature of many of these secreted factors, the consequences of SASP are context-dependent, and can influence multiple cell types within the tumor milieu ( Coppé et al., 2010; Faget et al., 2019 24. Coppé, J.P. ∙ Desprez, P.Y. ∙ Krtolica, A. ... The senescence-associated secretory phenotype: the dark side of tumor suppression Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2010; 5 :99-118 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Faget, D.V. ∙ Ren, Q. ∙ Stewart, S.A. Unmasking senescence: context-dependent effects of SASP in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :439-453 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, while SASP factors can be pro- or anti-tumorigenic, their production by pre-malignant cells can stimulate immune surveillance, leading to the clearance of senescent cells and contributing to tumor suppression ( Kang et al., 2011; Tasdemir et al., 2016 43. Kang, T.W. ∙ Yevsa, T. ∙ Woller, N. ... Senescence surveillance of pre-malignant hepatocytes limits liver cancer development Nature. 2011; 479 :547-551 Crossref Scopus (661) PubMed Google Scholar 99. Tasdemir, N. ∙ Banito, A. ∙ Roe, J.S. ... BRD4 Connects Enhancer Remodeling to Senescence Immune Surveillance Cancer Discov. 2016; 6 :612-629 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although cancer cells evade senescence early during the course of tumor evolution, restoration of this program in advanced cancers can have profound anti-tumor effects. Indeed, genetic restoration of p53 in a RAS-driven liver carcinoma model induces senescence to promote tumor clearance by triggering innate immune surveillance ( Xue et al., 2007 103. Xue, W. ∙ Zender, L. ∙ Miething, C. ... Senescence and tumour clearance is triggered by p53 restoration in murine liver carcinomas Nature. 2007; 445 :656-660 Crossref Scopus (1502) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pharmacological strategies that induce tumor cell senescence can also facilitate anti-tumor immunity and tumor regressions despite the absence of cytotoxicity to cancer cells themselves. For example, in a KRAS mutant lung cancer model, the induction of senescence by trametinib and palbociclib treatment triggered SASP-dependent and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor regressions, even in tumors lacking p53 ( Ruscetti et al., 2018 85. Ruscetti, M. ∙ Leibold, J. ∙ Bott, M.J. ... NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination Science. 2018; 362 :1416-1422 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intrigued by the ability of these RAS pathway-targeted therapies to produce therapeutically relevant effects on the surrounding TME, we set out to explore how senescence induction could remodel the hypovascular and immune suppressive PDAC TME and alter the treatment landscape of this disease.

Section: Results

Combined trametinib and palbociclib (T/P) treatment, but neither agent alone, potently induces senescence and SASP in human PDAC lines ( Ruscetti et al., 2018 85. Ruscetti, M. ∙ Leibold, J. ∙ Bott, M.J. ... NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination Science. 2018; 362 :1416-1422 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if therapy-induced senescence can alter the PDAC TME, we evaluated the response to T/P treatment in two mouse models of PDAC that recapitulate the histopathology and stromal responses observed clinically: the Pdx1-Cre ; LSL-KRAS G12D ; Trp53 fl/wt ( KPC flox ) genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), where tumors form autochthonously in the pancreas ( Herreros-Villanueva et al., 2012 36. Herreros-Villanueva, M. ∙ Hijona, E. ∙ Cosme, A. ... Mouse models of pancreatic cancer World J. Gastroenterol. 2012; 18 :1286-1294 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ); and orthotopic transplantation of PDAC organoids derived from tumors arising in Pdx1-Cre ; LSL-KRAS G12D ; Trp53 R172H/wt ( KPC mut ) mice into the pancreata of syngeneic C57BL/6 recipients ( Boj et al., 2015; Hingorani et al., 2003 7.

Preinvasive and invasive ductal pancreatic cancer and its early detection in the mouse Cancer Cell. 2003; 4 :437-450 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1501) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Two-week treatment with T/P (but neither agent alone) led to decreased proliferation, inhibition of ERK and RB phosphorylation, and induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity in the absence of apoptosis in both KPC flox GEMM and KPC mut organoid transplant models ( Figures 1 A, S1 A, and S1B). This response was associated with a modest increase in the survival of PDAC-bearing animals ( Figures S1 C and S1D). In contrast to KRAS-driven lung cancer models ( Ruscetti et al., 2018 85. Ruscetti, M. ∙ Leibold, J. ∙ Bott, M.J. ... NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination Science. 2018; 362 :1416-1422 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), however, T/P treatment did not increase NK cell numbers, activation, or cytotoxicity, and failed to elicit tumor regressions ( Figures S1 B and S1E–S1H). Therefore, while T/P treatment triggers senescence in PDAC, this does not engage NK cell surveillance or produce robust tumor regressions.
Close inspection of T/P-treated tumor sections showed an accumulation of blood vessels adjacent to tumor cells ( Figure 1 B), suggesting that T/P therapy may affect the TME in other ways. Combinatorial treatment led to an increase in CD31 + blood vessel density and closer proximity of vessels and tumor cells in both organoid transplant and GEMM models ( Figures 1 B, 1C, S1 I, and S1J). By contrast, no change in the number of lymphatic vessels was observed ( Figure S1 L). Although many blood vessels in vehicle-treated PDAC tumors appeared collapsed, most in T/P-treated tumors harbored open and readily discernible lumens ( Figures 1 B, 1D, S1 I, and S1K). T/P treatment also reduced the stromal content of hyaluronic acid (HA), an effect linked to increased vessel opening in PDAC ( Provenzano et al., 2012 79. Provenzano, P.P. ∙ Cuevas, C. ∙ Chang, A.E. ... Enzymatic targeting of the stroma ablates physical barriers to treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 :418-429 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ), without affecting collagen deposition or accumulation of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive myofibroblasts ( Figures 1 B, S1 M, and S1N). Whereas the improved vascularization achieved through inhibition of signaling pathways involved in maintaining the desmoplastic stroma is associated with increased metastasis ( Lee et al., 2014 50. Lee, J.J. ∙ Perera, R.M. ∙ Wang, H. ... Stromal response to Hedgehog signaling restrains pancreatic cancer progression. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014; E3091-E3100 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rhim et al. , 2014 80. Rhim, A.D. ∙ Oberstein, P.E. ∙ Thomas, D.H. ... Stromal elements act to restrain, rather than support, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2014; 25 :735-747 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (857) PubMed Google Scholar ), PDAC-bearing mice treated with T/P showed fewer metastases compared to controls ( Figures S1 O and S1P). Hence, T/P treatment induces vascular remodeling without metastatic adaptation.
Compared to controls, the blood vessels present in T/P-treated tumors were associated with higher levels of αSMA and the pericyte marker PDGFRβ, characteristics of a mature vasculature ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 Q). Vascular endothelial cells also displayed upregulation of immunomodulatory cell surface molecules such as P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 (a phenomenon hereafter referred to as endothelial cell activation) that are expressed on permeable blood vessels that accompany tissue inflammation ( Figures 1 G, 1H, S1 R, and S1S) ( Hunt and Jurd, 1998; Lorenzon et al., 1998 40. Hunt, B.J. ∙ Jurd, K.M. Endothelial cell activation. A central pathophysiological process BMJ. 1998; 316 :1328-1329 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 55. Lorenzon, P. ∙ Vecile, E. ∙ Nardon, E. ... Endothelial cell E- and P-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 function as signaling receptors J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142 :1381-1391 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, T/P treatment, perhaps by promoting senescence, leads to multiple vascular remodeling phenotypes in PDAC models.
In addition to immunomodulatory factors, senescent cells secrete SASP factors that can alter endothelial cell proliferation and behavior ( Ancrile et al., 2007; Coppé et al., 2006; Mikuła-Pietrasik et al., 2016; Oubaha et al., 2016 2.

Senescence-associated secretory phenotype contributes to pathological angiogenesis in retinopathy Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :362ra144 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, murine and human PDAC lines treated with T/P displayed increased secretion of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGFA/B, FGF2) and MMPs (MMP2/3/7/9/10) compared to cells treated with single agents ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). Increased expression of these SASP factors was also detected in tumor cells sorted from T/P-treated tumors derived from orthotopic transplant of KPC mut cell lines engineered to express luciferase and GFP, and conditioned media from KPC mut cells pretreated with T/P was able to support the proliferation of endothelial cells in culture ( Figures 2 B, S2 B, and S2C). Similarly, when endothelial cells were grown on a 3D basement membrane, conditioned media from T/P-treated KPC mut cells promoted the formation of tube-like structures that were reminiscent of vascular networks in vivo ( Figure 2 C).
Other stromal subtypes in the PDAC TME, most prominently fibroblasts and macrophages, can also secrete factors that promote angiogenesis. However, T/P treatment did not stimulate the secretion of angiogenic factors from pancreatic fibroblasts, and conditioned media from T/P-treated senescent PDAC cells did not affect fibroblast or macrophage proliferation ( Figures S2 D–S2F). While there was an increase in the number of PDAC-associated F4/80 + macrophages and their expression of MHC-II and CD86 following T/P treatment, we only observed minor changes in expression of VEGF or other macrophage polarization markers ( Figures S2 G–S2I). Furthermore, the vascular remodeling that accompanied senescence induction was not dependent on immune cells, as T/P treatment of tumors derived from KPC mut organoids injected orthotopically into C567BL/6 or immunodeficient NOD- scid IL2Rγ null (NSG) mice led to similar increases in vascular density, open vessel lumens, and endothelial activation ( Figures S2 J–S2L). Therefore, senescent tumor cells are likely the primary source of angiogenic SASP factors following T/P treatment.
To directly test whether the SASP contributes to vascular remodeling in vivo , KPC mut organoids were transduced with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the p65 subunit of NF-κB, a transcription factor required for SASP induction but dispensable for senescence-mediated growth arrest ( Chien et al., 2011; Ruscetti et al., 2018 17. Chien, Y. ∙ Scuoppo, C. ∙ Wang, X. ... Control of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype by NF-κB promotes senescence and enhances chemosensitivity Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :2125-2136 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar 85.

NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination Science. 2018; 362 :1416-1422 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). As predicted, suppression of NF-κB in PDAC cells treated with T/P reduced the secretion of both immune modulatory and pro-angiogenic SASP factors ( Figure 2 D). KPC mut organoids expressing the p65 or control ( Ren ) shRNA were then transplanted orthotopically into C57BL/6 mice to assess the impact of SASP suppression on vascular remodeling. While potent NF-κB inhibition can block proliferation of KRAS mutant tumors in some contexts ( Lesina et al., 2016; Meylan et al., 2009 51. Lesina, M. ∙ Wörmann, S.M. ∙ Morton, J. ...

Requirement for NF-kappaB signalling in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma Nature. 2009; 462 :104-107 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ), partial NF-κB suppression using p65-targeting shRNAs did not affect tumor growth or senescence-associated cell-cycle arrest of KPC mut organoid-derived tumors following T/P treatment ( Figures S3 A–S3C). Instead, p65 suppression blocked the increase in vascular density, maturation, perfusion, and immunomodulatory activation, as well as the decrease in HA levels that accompanies T/P treatment in tumors harboring Ren shRNAs ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S3 D–S3H).
VEGF was one SASP factor that contributed to vascular remodeling. Treatment of human and murine PDAC cells produced an NF-κB-dependent increase in VEGF secretion ( Figures 2 A, 2D, and S2 A). Moreover, suppression of VEGFR-2, the cognate receptor for VEGF, using high doses of the VEGFR-2 blocking antibody DC101 effectively inhibited neo-vascularization following T/P treatment ( Figure 2 G). By contrast, VEGFR-2 blockade did not inhibit the upregulation of endothelial activation markers P-selectin and VCAM-1 following T/P treatment, which instead were suppressed using antagonizing antibodies against other inflammatory SASP factors, including CCL5, CXCL1, and interleukin (IL)-6 ( Figures 2 H and S3 I). Thus, different SASP factors collaborate to produce vascular remodeling and endothelial cell activation after T/P treatment.
The hypovascularity and vascular compression associated with PDAC contributes to its chemo-refractory nature by impeding drug delivery to the tumor ( Olive et al., 2009; Provenzano et al., 2012 74.

Enzymatic targeting of the stroma ablates physical barriers to treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 :418-429 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if SASP-mediated vascular remodeling enhances tumor perfusion and permeability of soluble factors, including standard-of-care gemcitabine chemotherapy, tumor-bearing KPC mu t organoid transplant or KPC flox GEMM mice were pretreated with vehicle or T/P for 2 weeks, and then injected with (1) lectin, (2) a high molecular weight dextran, and/or (3) a 14 C-labeled gemcitabine radiotracer. Consistent with the increase in vessel size and maturation, vessels in T/P pretreated tumors had increased lectin perfusion ( Figure 3 A). T/P pretreated tumors also had significantly more dextran accumulation as compared to controls, indicative of enhanced vessel permeability ( Figures 3 A and S4 B). These dual effects of T/P treatment on vascular permeability and perfusion resulted in no change in hypoxia in the PDAC TME as assessed by pimonidazole staining ( Figure S4 A).
T/P pretreatment also increased gemcitabine penetration into the tumor, particularly in focal regions containing high densities of SA-β-gal + senescent cells and blood vessels ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S4 B). By contrast, such effects were not observed in the normal pancreas or other organs of the same tumor-bearing mice ( Figure S4 C). The increase in drug uptake and dextran accumulation in tumors following T/P treatment was suppressed upon tumor-specific p65 knockdown or DC101 treatment, indicating these processes were dependent on SASP induction and signaling through the SASP factor VEGF ( Figures 3 B and S4 D).
To assess whether the addition of gemcitabine to the T/P combination (T/P/G) produced better treatment outcomes than either regimen alone, cohorts of tumor-bearing KPC mut organoid transplant or KPC flox GEMM mice were monitored for tumor response and for overall survival following treatment with gemcitabine, T/P, or both. To examine the contribution of the remodeled vasculature to drug activity, some mice were also treated with DC101 to prevent SASP-mediated neo-vascularization. As is often observed clinically ( Carmichael et al., 1996 13. Carmichael, J. ∙ Fink, U. ∙ Russell, R.C. ... Phase II study of gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73 :101-105 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), gemcitabine alone had modest effects on tumor growth and limited survival impact in our murine PDAC models ( Figures 3 C–3F). T/P treatment modestly delayed tumor growth and produced a marginal survival advantage, but the T/P/G regimen produced potent tumor regressions and significantly enhanced survival, effects that were largely ablated by DC101 ( Figures 3 C–3F). Similar efficacy was observed when PDAC-bearing mice were treated using an alternating weekly schedule of T/P and gemcitabine ( Figures 3 C). These results further support a role for T/P pretreatment in priming gemcitabine efficacy through its vascular remodeling effects, as has been observed in other settings ( Olive et al., 2009; Provenzano et al., 2012 74. Olive, K.P. ∙ Jacobetz, M.A. ∙ Davidson, C.J. ... Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling enhances delivery of chemotherapy in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer Science. 2009; 324 :1457-1461 Crossref Scopus (1982) PubMed Google Scholar 79.

Enzymatic targeting of the stroma ablates physical barriers to treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 :418-429 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Histological analyses of tumors revealed that T/P or gemcitabine treatment alone was not cytotoxic, but the T/P/G regimen produced considerable tumor cell apoptosis that could be blocked by DC101 ( Figures 3 G, S4 E, and S4F). We suspect that this increase in tumor cell apoptosis results from a culling of cycling tumor cells that fail to senesce, as analysis of the residual tumor mass following short-term T/P/G treatment revealed an enrichment for non-proliferating and SA-β-gal-positive cells as compared to T/P or gemcitabine treatment alone ( Figures 3 G and S4 E–S4G). Thus, SASP-provoked vascular remodeling can enhance PDAC responses to cytotoxic chemotherapy, at least in part, by facilitating drug uptake.
We also examined the treatment responses of two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models propagated through subcutaneous transplantation of PDAC tissue into immunodeficient mice. While many subcutaneous xenograft models lack the dense stroma and hypovascularity found in autochthonous PDACs ( Olive et al., 2009 74. Olive, K.P. ∙ Jacobetz, M.A. ∙ Davidson, C.J. ... Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling enhances delivery of chemotherapy in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer Science. 2009; 324 :1457-1461 Crossref Scopus (1982) PubMed Google Scholar ), two models obtained from patients that had progressed under gemcitabine chemotherapy regimens retained a robust and dense stroma and thus were chosen for further analysis ( Figure S4 H). As was noted in the murine models, T/P treatment triggered proliferative arrest and senescence in PDX tumors, together with an increase in vascular density and lumen diameter and HA degradation in the stroma ( Figures S4 H–S4K). Both PDX models had only a modest response to gemcitabine alone, whereas T/P/G therapy produced an increase in apoptosis associated with sustained tumor growth inhibition and partial tumor regressions in some mice ( Figures S4 L–S4N). Thus, vascular remodeling following therapy-induced senescence also sensitizes human PDAC to chemotherapy.
Besides its dysfunctional vasculature, human and mouse PDAC displays an abundance of immune suppressive myeloid and regulatory T cells (T regs ) together with a scarcity of cytotoxic lymphocytes ( Blando et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2007; Vonderheide and Bayne, 2013 6. Blando, J. ∙ Sharma, A. ∙ Higa, M.G. ... Comparison of immune infiltrates in melanoma and pancreatic cancer highlights VISTA as a potential target in pancreatic cancer Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Inflammatory networks and immune surveillance of pancreatic carcinoma Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2013; 25 :200-205 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, these tumors are considered immunologically “cold.” Hypovascularity and lack of an activated endothelium can also impair lymphocyte homing to normal and malignant tissues ( Huang et al., 2018; Muller, 2009; Wu et al., 1992 39. Huang, Y. ∙ Kim, B.Y.S. ∙ Chan, C.K. ... Improving immune-vascular crosstalk for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :195-203 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Muller, W.A.

Diminished leukocyte-endothelium interaction in tumor microvessels Cancer Res. 1992; 52 :4265-4268 PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore used a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to assess the consequences of perturbing SASP, neo-vascularization, or endothelial cell activation on immune cell infiltrates following T/P therapy.
Consistent with the above results (see Figures S1 E and S1F), drug treatment did not increase NK cell numbers or activity in any of the three murine PDAC models tested, and antibody-mediated NK cell depletion did not affect the survival of T/P-treated mice harboring orthotopically transplanted KPC mut cell-derived tumors ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Instead, we noted a substantial increase in the influx of T cells, and in particular, CD8 + T cells, into the tumor mass of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC following 2-week T/P treatment ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and S5 C). Immunophenotyping confirmed that this increase was mainly due to CD8 + T cell accumulation that occurred in the absence of changes in Ly6G + neutrophil, Gr-1 hi CD11b + myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC), FOXP3 + T reg , or FAP + fibroblast populations that have been associated with CD8 + T cell suppression in PDAC ( Figures 4 C, 4D, and S5 D–S5F) ( Clark et al., 2007; Feig et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2016; Steele et al., 2016 19.

CXCR2 Inhibition Profoundly Suppresses Metastases and Augments Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2016; 29 :832-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ). This T/P treatment-induced increase in CD8 + T cells required SASP-mediated vascular remodeling, as the effect was largely abolished in tumors harboring a p65 shRNA or treated with DC101 ( Figures 4 E–4H).
To assess whether endothelial cell activation contributes to CD8 + T cell accumulation that accompanies senescence in T/P-treated PDAC, we used neutralizing antibodies against the P-selectin ligand PSGL-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1, and evaluated the PDAC immune landscape. Blockade of VCAM-1, but not PSGL-1 or ICAM-1, significantly reduced the numbers of total and CD8 + tumor-infiltrating T cells in T/P treated-mice ( Figures 4 I and 4J). VCAM-1 induction on endothelial cells facilitates blood vessel adhesion and tissue extravasation of T cells expressing its ligand, VLA-4 ( Lorenzon et al., 1998; Nandi et al., 2004 55. Lorenzon, P. ∙ Vecile, E. ∙ Nardon, E. ... Endothelial cell E- and P-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 function as signaling receptors J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142 :1381-1391 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Nandi, A. ∙ Estess, P. ∙ Siegelman, M. Bimolecular complex between rolling and firm adhesion receptors required for cell arrest; CD44 association with VLA-4 in T cell extravasation Immunity. 2004; 20 :455-465 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, VLA-4 expression was elevated on CD8 + T cells isolated from transplanted PDAC in a SASP-dependent manner following T/P treatment ( Figure S5 G). Thus, SASP-induced vascular remodeling, in part through the VCAM-1/VLA-4 cell adhesion axis, enables the penetration of CD8 + T cells into the PDAC TME.
PDAC-associated CD8 + T cells expressed higher levels of the activation markers CD69 and CD44 following T/P, but not single agent or vehicle treatment ( Figures 5 A and 5B). This effect was dependent on SASP-mediated vascular remodeling ( Figures S6 A–S6D), hinting that senescence induction in tumor cells may stimulate the activity of tumor-reactive T cells. Of note, both MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors can increase antigen presentation and T cell targeting of tumor cells in other cancer models ( Brea et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2018; Ebert et al., 2016; Goel et al., 2017; Schaer et al., 2018 10.

Nonetheless, the T/P combination produced a much greater increase in the expression of these genes as well as surface level expression of MHC-I in orthotopic KPC mut tumors ( Figures 5 C and S6 E). This effect appeared functionally meaningful, as OT-1 T cells co-cultured with antigen matched ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing KPC mut PDAC cells showed enhanced T cell activation and expression of the effector cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon (IFN)-γ after T/P-pretreatment of tumor cells in an MHC-I-dependent manner ( Figures S6 F and S6G).
Despite producing conditions that favor activation of cytotoxic T cell effector functions, T/P treatment did not stimulate robust anti-tumor T cell immunity in PDAC. Hence, T cells isolated from KPC mut tumors following T/P treatment did not express the cytotoxicity marker CD107a, and neither CD8 nor CD4 depletion altered the modest survival advantage produced by T/P therapy ( Figures 5 D and 5E). In agreement, CD8 + T cells isolated from the T/P treatment cohort displayed higher expression levels of the exhaustion markers PD-1, 2B4, CTLA-4, and LAG3 ( Figure 5 F). While PD-1 expression can indicate prior T cell activation and priming, it can also induce T cell exhaustion and dysfunction through binding to its ligand PD-L1 ( Sharpe and Pauken, 2018; Sun et al., 2018 92. Sharpe, A.H. ∙ Pauken, K.E. The diverse functions of the PD1 inhibitory pathway Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :153-167 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar 98. Sun, C. ∙ Mezzadra, R. ∙ Schumacher, T.N. Regulation and Function of the PD-L1 Checkpoint Immunity. 2018; 48 :434-452 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (945) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, immune, endothelial, and tumor cells each showed a significant increase in surface expression of PD-L1 after T/P treatment ( Figure 5 G). Therefore, despite initial influx of activated T cells into PDAC undergoing therapy-induced senescence, CD8 + T cells rapidly become phenotypically exhausted and do not contribute to an anti-tumor response.
Induction of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory axis in T cell inflamed tumors following T/P treatment provides a clear rationale for combining senescence-inducing agents with PD-1 blockade. First, we examined activation and exhaustion marker expression on CD8 + T cells isolated from KPC mut cell transplant tumors treated with T/P in combination with PD-1 blockade (T/P/PD-1). Remarkably, CD8 + T cells from T/P/PD-1-treated tumors displayed reduced expression of exhaustion markers and increased co-expression of activation markers CD69 and CD44 compared to T/P treatment alone ( Figures 6 A–6C). These T cells also displayed higher TNF-α, INF-γ, and granzyme B expression compared to those harvested from tumors following T/P or PD-1 treatment alone, further indicative of reversion of lymphocyte dysfunction ( Figures 6 D and 6E).
Tumors isolated from mice treated with T/P and PD-1 blockade displayed increased apoptosis compared to anti-PD-1 therapy alone ( Figure 6 F). Activated T cells appeared to preferentially target senescent tumor cells, as T/P/PD-1-treated tumors showed a reduction in SA-β-gal positive cells compared to T/P treatment ( Figure 6 G). Both senescence-associated vascular remodeling and CD8 + T cell mobilization were required for these effects, because apoptosis produced by T/P/PD-1 treatment was abrogated by tumor specific suppression of p65 , VEGFR-2 signaling disruption, VCAM-1 neutralization, and CD8 depletion ( Figures 6 F and 6H). Thus, PD-1 checkpoint blockade reawakens exhausted CD8 + T cells to trigger anti-tumor immunity following senescence induction.
The above results prompted us to assess the efficacy of T/P/PD-1 therapy in our preclinical murine PDAC models. Studies suggest that immune checkpoint blockade efficacy is partly dependent on mutations recognized as “non-self” by T cells ( Samstein et al., 2019; Schumacher and Schreiber, 2015 87. Samstein, R.M. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Shoushtari, A.N. ... Tumor mutational load predicts survival after immunotherapy across multiple cancer types Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :202-206 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar 90. Schumacher, T.N. ∙ Schreiber, R.D. Neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy Science. 2015; 348 :69-74 Crossref Scopus (1840) PubMed Google Scholar ); accordingly, we observed a mutation burden consistent with that of human PDAC in our mouse models ( Figure S7 A). Thus, PDAC-bearing KPC mut organoid transplant or KPC flox GEMM mice were treated with T/P and/or anti-PD-1 therapy and monitored for changes in biological responses, tumor growth, and overall survival.
The anti-tumor effects of combining immune checkpoint blockade with the senescence-inducing T/P regimen went well beyond what was observed following standard-of-care gemcitabine (see Figure 3 ), or either T/P or anti-PD1 treatment alone. Two-week treatment with T/P/PD-1 produced areas of tumor destruction visible by gross histology and tumor regressions in 4/9 KPC flox GEMM and 10/10 KPC mut organoid transplant mice ( Figures 7 A–7D). By contrast, all tumors treated with anti-PD1 alone continued to progress after 2-week treatment ( Figures 7 C and 7D). These anti-tumor effects translated into increased survival, producing an over 5-fold increase in the median survival of KPC flox GEMM mice treated with T/P/PD-1 as compared to PD-1 alone and a number of long-term survivors in both models ( Figures 7 E and 7F). The anti-tumor effects of PD-1 checkpoint blockade were predicated on potent MEK inhibition, as administration of the T/P/PD-1 regimen at a suboptimal trametinib dose (0.3 mg/kg) that was insufficient to inhibit ERK phosphorylation or induce senescence and its vascular or T cell remodeling effects was not efficacious ( Figures S7 B–S7D). These data imply that senescence induction upon combined T/P treatment is necessary to potentiate PD-1 blockade in PDAC models.
We also evaluated treatment responses in PDAC-bearing mice in which SASP was disabled by p65 shRNA, vascular remodeling was perturbed by VEGFR-2 or VCAM-1 antibodies, or either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells were depleted. p65 , VEGFR-2, or VCAM-1 inhibition largely blocked the ability of T/P/PD-1 treatment to elicit tumor destruction and produce robust tumor regressions ( Figures 7 A–7F, S7 E, and S7F). Synergy between T/P treatment and PD-1 blockade was dependent on CD8 + , but not CD4 + T cells ( Figures 7 A–7F). Histological analysis of KPC flox GEMM tumors that relapsed after long-term T/P/PD-1 therapy consistently showed hypovascularization, as well as poor endothelial activation and T cell penetration, similar to those of vehicle-treated mice ( Figures S7 G–S7I). These data imply that senescence-inducing therapies can increase T cell infiltration and reactivity in previously immunologically “cold” tumors, thus sensitizing PDAC to immune checkpoint blockade.

Section: Discussion

The desmoplastic stroma of PDAC fosters a hypovascularized and immune suppressive TME that impedes the penetration of small molecule drugs and stifles anti-tumor immunity, leading to de novo resistance to chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade ( Brahmer et al., 2012; Carmichael et al., 1996; Olive et al., 2009; Royal et al., 2010 9.

Immunother. 2010; 33 :828-833 Crossref Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show how molecularly targeted therapies that drive PDAC cells into senescence can engage a tumor suppressive program that remodels the TME and creates therapeutic vulnerabilities, at least in part, through SASP-facilitated vascular remodeling. On one hand, this response increases blood vessel density and permeability, leading to enhanced uptake and activity of the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine; on the other, it facilitates the tumor infiltration of CD8 + T cells that, although exhausted, can be reawakened by checkpoint blockade. As a consequence, the addition of gemcitabine or anti-PD-1 therapy to the T/P regimen produces tumor cell death and sustained tumor regressions in otherwise highly refractory PDAC models.
The impact of therapy-induced senescence on PDAC vasculature function was unexpected. While the SASP can alter endothelial cell behavior in culture and in xenograft models, the biological impact of pro-angiogenic SASP factors on the TME has been hypothesized to be pro-oncogenic ( Ancrile et al., 2007; Coppé et al., 2006; Mikuła-Pietrasik et al., 2016; Oubaha et al., 2016 2.

Senescence-associated secretory phenotype contributes to pathological angiogenesis in retinopathy Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :362ra144 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in PDAC, these SASP factors produce the opposite outcome, leading to improved access of small molecules and immune cells into the tumor that ultimately enables its destruction. Mechanistically, SASP-facilitated vascular remodeling involves collaboration between pro-angiogenic (e.g., VEGF) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., CCL5, CXCL-1, and IL-6) SASP components, leading to increased blood vessel density and endothelial cell activation, respectively. While stromal sources of angiogenic or inflammatory cytokines may potentiate its effects, our results demonstrate that SASP secretion from tumor cells is essential for the observed phenotypes.
Neo-angiogenesis is typically considered a prerequisite for cancer progression and, as such, therapies that inhibit this process have been a focus of drug development efforts ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; Jain et al., 2006; Zirlik and Duyster, 2018 35.

Anti-Angiogenics: Current Situation and Future Perspectives Oncol. Res. Treat. 2018; 41 :166-171 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, owing to the hypovascularity of PDAC, studies suggest that therapies that improve, rather than inhibit, vascular function might establish therapeutic windows for treating this disease ( Olive et al., 2009; Provenzano et al., 2012 74. Olive, K.P. ∙ Jacobetz, M.A. ∙ Davidson, C.J. ...

Enzymatic targeting of the stroma ablates physical barriers to treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 :418-429 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ). One such approach involves disrupting stromal hedgehog signaling, which leads to increased vascular perfusion and drug accessibility by inhibiting myofibroblast activity ( Olive et al., 2009 74. Olive, K.P. ∙ Jacobetz, M.A. ∙ Davidson, C.J. ... Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling enhances delivery of chemotherapy in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer Science. 2009; 324 :1457-1461 Crossref Scopus (1982) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, over time, depletion of key tumor suppressive stromal elements with this method culminates in tumor cell dedifferentiation and a more aggressive and metastatic disease ( Rhim et al., 2014; Rosow et al., 2012 80. Rhim, A.D. ∙ Oberstein, P.E. ∙ Thomas, D.H. ...

Sonic Hedgehog in pancreatic cancer: from bench to bedside, then back to the bench Surgery. 2012; 152 :S19-S32 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, the manner in which therapy-induced senescence increases tumor perfusion is distinct, producing a more functional vasculature without compromising tumor suppressive stromal components or promoting metastasis. Additionally, T/P-induced reduction in stromal HA content may relieve interstitial fluid pressures and contribute to enhanced vascular perfusion in our models ( Provenzano et al., 2012 79. Provenzano, P.P. ∙ Cuevas, C. ∙ Chang, A.E. ... Enzymatic targeting of the stroma ablates physical barriers to treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 :418-429 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Despite its limited activity, gemcitabine is part of the standard-of-care therapy for pancreatic cancer patients. While combinatorial approaches using gemcitabine are in pre-clinical and clinical use, the notion of combining cytostatic therapies with gemcitabine would not typically be pursued owing to the apparent requirement for DNA synthesis for gemcitabine-mediated toxicity ( Plunkett et al., 1995 77.

Yet, our data demonstrate that T/P therapy facilitates both gemcitabine uptake and its ability to promote tumor cell apoptosis, similar to what occurs following treatment with other agents that increase vascular perfusion in PDAC ( Olive et al., 2009; Provenzano et al., 2012 74.

Enzymatic targeting of the stroma ablates physical barriers to treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 :418-429 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ). We suspect that the efficacy of this three-drug combination is not a result of tumor-cell specific synergies, but instead arises from the improved ability of gemcitabine to target tumor cells that fail to senesce upon T/P treatment. Still, it remains possible that genomic instability resulting from senescence induction ( Kotsantis et al., 2018; Woo and Poon, 2004 45. Kotsantis, P. ∙ Petermann, E. ∙ Boulton, S.J.

Activated oncogenes promote and cooperate with chromosomal instability for neoplastic transformation Genes Dev. 2004; 18 :1317-1330 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), perhaps exacerbated by a defective p53-dependent G1 checkpoint, might also enhance gemcitabine cytotoxicity.
In addition to promoting uptake of soluble factors, SASP-facilitated vascular remodeling enables T cell penetration into PDAC and improves the efficacy of checkpoint blockade. Here, one critical outcome of SASP induction is increased endothelial cell expression of VCAM-1, a cell surface protein that stimulates lymphocyte adhesion and extravasation into tissues. Indeed, VCAM-1 is required for T cell infiltration and potentiation of PD-1 blockade following T/P therapy in our PDAC models. Collectively, these observations provide a compelling link between therapy-induced SASP, vascular remodeling, and immune cell infiltration, and add to a growing body of evidence that vascular normalization can enhance the efficacy of other T cell-directed immunotherapies ( Buckanovich et al., 2008; Hamzah et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2012; Shrimali et al., 2010 11.

Previous work has established that targeted therapies, including CDK4/6 inhibitors, can cooperate with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in other cancers ( Deng et al., 2018; Ebert et al., 2016; Goel et al., 2017; Schaer et al., 2018 27.

However, in contrast to our work, these studies employed immunologically “hot” and T cell “rich” cancer models that are typically responsive to checkpoint blockade. Moreover, focus of previous work has been on how these agents might increase T cell recognition or cytotoxicity rather than how T cells gain access to the tumor. Our study uses immunologically “cold” models of PDAC, a disease unresponsive to checkpoint blockade, to establish a mechanism for the latter effect, showing how T/P-induced senescence leads to endothelial activation and VCAM-1 upregulation that promotes T cell extravasation into tumors and sets the stage for efficient immunotherapy responses. Tumor cell autonomous effects may also play a role in stimulating T cell reactivity, and it is noteworthy that MHC-I upregulation following T/P treatment of PDAC cells is much greater than that produced by either agent alone.
The effects of the SASP on the TME can be context-dependent. Thus, while the most prominent effects of T/P therapy in PDAC are SASP-dependent vascular remodeling and T cell surveillance, the outcome of T/P-induced senescence in lung cancer models involves a SASP-facilitated NK cell surveillance program ( Ruscetti et al., 2018 85. Ruscetti, M. ∙ Leibold, J. ∙ Bott, M.J. ... NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination Science. 2018; 362 :1416-1422 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). This tissue specificity cannot be explained by differences in tumor genotype (both studies used models driven by mutant KRAS and p53 alterations) or in VEGF secretion (that was induced in pancreas and lung cancer models). Instead, we hypothesize that these contextual differences arise from the tissue architecture of tumors arising in each organ: the lungs are generally NK cell-rich and lung tumors are highly vascularized; by contrast, the pancreas harbors few NK cells and PDAC tumors are avascular ( Salmon et al., 2019 86. Salmon, H. ∙ Remark, R. ∙ Gnjatic, S. ... Host tissue determinants of tumour immunity Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :215-227 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, each TME may be more or less susceptible to different SASP components. Regardless, in both models, pharmacological induction of senescence can evoke latent anti-tumor immunity.
We suspect the profound tissue remodeling observed following therapy-induced senescence reflects the reengagement of an innate tumor suppressive mechanism that participates in tissue regeneration. Numerous studies suggest that senescence coordinates tissue remodeling activities associated with wound repair and resolution that are critical for organ homeostasis ( Demaria et al., 2014; Krizhanovsky et al., 2008; Lujambio et al., 2013; Mosteiro et al., 2016; Neves et al., 2015 25.

Of flies, mice, and men: evolutionarily conserved tissue damage responses and aging Dev. Cell. 2015; 32 :9-18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the presence of chronic tissue damage, hyperactivation of this wound-healing response without senescent cell clearance can be deleterious and even pro-oncogenic ( Baker et al., 2016; Demaria et al., 2017; Schafer et al., 2017 4. Baker, D.J. ∙ Childs, B.G. ∙ Durik, M. ... Naturally occurring p16(Ink4a)-positive cells shorten healthy lifespan Nature. 2016; 530 :184-189 Crossref Scopus (895) PubMed Google Scholar 26.

Schafer, M.J. ∙ White, T.A. ∙ Iijima, K. ... Cellular senescence mediates fibrotic pulmonary disease Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14532 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, when acutely activated in tumor cells, the senescence program recapitulates many aspects of this native wound resolution response, halting further tumor cell proliferation while simultaneously modulating multiple components of the tissue environment to promote homeostasis. As such, senescence induction may prove more effective at remodeling the TME than targeting individual tissue components. It will be interesting to compare and contrast the immune-enhancing effects of senescence-inducing therapies to agents that target specific immune suppressive factors in PDAC ( Feig et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2016; Panni et al., 2019 32. Feig, C. ∙ Jones, J.O. ∙ Kraman, M. ... Targeting CXCL12 from FAP-expressing carcinoma-associated fibroblasts synergizes with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Med. 2019; 11 :eaau9240 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our data provide a clear rationale for combining senescence-inducing therapies with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy to cull heterogeneous tumor cell populations in PDAC and perhaps other cancers as well. Although well-tolerated in our mouse models, the potential toxicities of the three drug combinations (trametinib and palbociclib together with either gemcitabine or anti-PD-1) will need to be closely monitored when extending these preclinical findings to human clinical trials. In principle, the stability of the senescence phenotype following T/P treatment may enable treatment regimens where these agents can be given sequentially on alternating schedules instead of simultaneously and continuously. It is noteworthy that treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma patients with a combination of MEK and BRAF inhibitors together with PD-1 blockade is highly efficacious and can be tolerated using an appropriate regimen ( Ribas et al., 2019 82. Ribas, A. ∙ Lawrence, D. ∙ Atkinson, V. ... Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition with PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in BRAF-mutant melanoma Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :936-940 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitor combination studied herein is a potent inducer of senescence in KRAS mutant cancers, other targeted and cytotoxic agents can also promote tumor cell senescence across a spectrum of cancer lineages and genotypic contexts ( Ewald et al., 2010; Sieben et al., 2018 30. Ewald, J.A. ∙ Desotelle, J.A. ∙ Wilding, G. ... Therapy-induced senescence in cancer J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2010; 102 :1536-1546 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar 94.

Consequently, our study provides one paradigm for combining such agents with immunomodulatory therapies to improve therapeutic outcomes.

PANC-1 (human, male), PU-8988T (human, female), MiaPaca-2 (human, male), and 3B11 (murine, male) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) or DSMZ. Murine KPC mut PDAC cell lines and organoids (male) were generated from PDAC arising in aged Pdx1-Cre;Kras LSL-G12D/+ ;Trp53 R172H/wt ( KPC mut ) mice. Cells were grown in “complete DMEM” containing 10% FBS and 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Cells and organoids were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Only cell lines were used for in vitro studies. All cells and organoids used were negative for mycoplasma. All human cell lines were authenticated by their source repository.
To generate KPC mut PDAC cell lines, tumors arising in Pdx1-Cre; LSL-Kras G12D/+ ; LSL-p53 R172H/ wt ( KPC mut ) mice were minced with scissors and the dissociated in 1 mg/ml Collagenase type V (C9263; Sigma) and 2U/ml Dispase II (04942078001; Roche) diluted in Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) (14025-076; Life technologies) at 37°C with mild agitation for up to 1 hour. The cell suspension was then plated on 10 cm 2 culture dishes coated with 100 μg/ml collagen (PureCol) (5005; Advanced Biomatrix) and grown in complete DMEM. Primary cultures were passaged at least 3 times to remove fibroblast contamination. KPC mut PDAC cells were then transduced with a Luciferase (Luc)-GFP co-expression vector to visualize them in vivo . Luc-GFP constructs were cloned into MSCV-based vectors and retroviruses were packaged by co-transfection of Gag-Pol expressing 293 T cells with expression constructs and envelope vectors (VSV-G) using the calcium phosphate method. Following transduction, cells were purified by FACS sorting the GFP + population on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences).
KPC mut PDAC organoids were generated by mincing and dissociating tumors arising in Pdx1-Cre; LSL-Kras G12D/+ ; LSL-p53 R172H/ wt ( KPC mut ) mice with collagenase and dispase as described above. Unfiltered, dissociated tissue was then seeded in growth factor-reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD) and cultured in advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with the following: 1% P/S, 2mM glutamine, 1X B27 supplement (12634-028; Invitrogen), 50ng/ml hEGF (PMG8043; Peprotech), 100ng/ml mNoggin (250-38; Peprotech), 100ng/ml hFGF10 (100-26; Peprotech), 10 nM hLeu-Gastrin I (G9145, Sigma), 1.25mM N-acetylcysteine (A9165; Sigma), 10mM Nicotinamide (N0636; Sigma), and R-spondin1 conditioned media (10% final). Organoids were passaged every 3-4 days.
Primary murine pancreatic fibroblasts from C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Cell Biologics, Inc. and grown in complete fibroblast media (M2267). To generate primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), bone marrow was flushed from the hind limbs of 9 week old female C57BL/6 mice under sterile conditions, passed through a 40 μm strainer and cultured in 30 mL Teflon Bags (PL-30; PermaLife) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse CSF1 (R&D systems). Bone marrow cells were cultured for 7 days, refreshing CSF1-containing media every other day, after which they were referred to as BMDMs.
All mouse experiments were approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Internal Animal Care and Use Committee under MSKCC IACUC protocol 11-06-018. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and food and water were provided ad libitum .
Trp53 fl/fl , LSL-Kras G12D/+ , and Pdx1-Cre strains on a C57BL/6 background were interbred to obtain Pdx1-Cre; LSL-Kras G12D/+ ; Trp53 fl/wt ( KPC flox ) mice. Both male and female KPC flox mice ranging from 2.5 to 12 months of age were used for treatment studies upon confirmation of tumor development. Mice were monitored for tumor development by ultrasound, and enrolled and randomized into treatment groups once tumors reached 100-300 mm 3 . Ultrasound imaging was repeated every 2 weeks during treatment to assess changes in pancreas tumor burden. For immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis, mice were treated for 2 weeks with indicated drugs. Upon sacrifice pancreas tumor tissue was allocated for 10% formalin fixation, OCT frozen blocks, and snap frozen tissue, and the rest used to generate single cell suspensions for flow cytometry analysis.
For orthotopic engraftment of KPC mut PDAC organoids derived from Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KRAS G12D/+ ; Trp53 R172H/wt ( KPC mut ) tumors, 8-10 week old C57BL/6 or NOD- scid IL2Rγ null (NSG) female mice (Jackson Laboratory) were first anesthetized using isoflurane and an incision was made in the left abdominal side. Organoids (approximately 1-3x10 5 cells/mouse) were prepared from cultures. Organoid cultures were dissociated with TrypLE (ThermoFisher; 12604-021) and finally resuspended in 25 μL of growth factor reduced Matrigel (354230; Corning) diluted 1:1 with cold adDMEM F/12 media supplemented with 2mM glutamine. The organoid suspension was injected into the tail region of the pancreas using a Hamilton Syringe. Successful injection was verified by the appearance of a fluid bubble without signs of intraperitoneal leakage. The abdominal wall was sutured with absorbable Vicryl sutures (Ethicon), and the skin was closed with wound clips (CellPoint Scientific Inc.). Mice were monitored for tumor development by ultrasound (anywhere from 1.5-6 months post-transplantation), and enrolled and randomized into treatment groups once tumors reached 100-300 mm 3 . Ultrasound imaging was repeated every 2 weeks during treatment to assess changes in pancreas tumor burden. For immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis, mice were treated for 2 weeks with indicated drugs. Upon sacrifice pancreas tumor tissue was allocated for 10% formalin fixation, OCT frozen blocks, and snap frozen tissue, and the rest used to generate single cell suspensions for flow cytometry analysis.
To rapidly generate orthotopic PDAC tumors in immunocompetent mice for immunophenotyping experiments, 5x10 4 KPC mut PDAC cells expressing luciferase and GFP (LUC-GFP) were orthotopically transplanted into the pancreas of 8-10 week old C57BL/6 female mice as described above. Mice were monitored for tumor development (5-8 days post-transplantation) by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) on a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum imager (PerkinElmer) before being randomized into various study cohorts. For immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis, mice were treated for 2 weeks with indicated drugs. Upon sacrifice pancreas tumor tissue was allocated for 10% formalin fixation, OCT frozen blocks, snap frozen tissue, and the rest for flow cytometric analysis.
5-7 week old female NOD- scid IL2Rγ null (NSG) mice were used for animal experiments with patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). PDAC PDXs used for preclinical studies were selected based upon presence of a robust stromal compartment and resistance to gemcitabine chemotherapy. MSK-PR07 is a PDAC PDX harboring mutations in KRAS ( G12D ) and p53 (L344Q) and derived from a patient treated with three rounds of chemotherapy: 1) gemcitabine and cisplatin, 2) FOLFIRINOX, and 3) gemcitabine and abraxane. MSK-PR05 is a PDAC PDX derived from a patient previously treated with gemcitabine, abraxane, and the HA degrading agent PEGPH20. Tumors were cut into pieces and inserted into a pocket in the subcutaneous space as previously described ( Poirier et al., 2015 78. Poirier, J.T. ∙ Gardner, E.E. ∙ Connis, N. ... DNA methylation in small cell lung cancer defines distinct disease subtypes and correlates with high expression of EZH2 Oncogene. 2015; 34 :5869-5878 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following inoculation, mice were monitored daily, weighed twice weekly, and caliper measurements begun when tumors became visible. Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: tumor volume = (D x d 2 )/2, in which D and d refer to the long and short tumor diameter, respectively. When tumors reached a size of 100-200 mm 3 , mice were randomized based on starting tumor volume (caliper measurements) and enrolled into treatment groups. Tumor size and mouse weights were recorded twice weekly. Experimental endpoints were achieved when tumors reached 2000 mm 3 or became ulcerated.
Trametinib (S2673) and palbociclib (S1116) were purchased from Selleck chemicals for in vitro studies. Drugs for in vitro studies were dissolved in DMSO (vehicle) to yield 10 mM stock solutions and stored at −80°C. For in vitro studies, growth media with or without drugs was changed every 2-3 days. For in vivo studies, trametinib (T-8123) and palbociclib (P-7744) were purchased from LC Laboratories. Trametinib was dissolved in a 5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and 2% Tween-80 solution (Sigma), and palbociclib in sodium lactate buffer (pH 4). Gemcitabine was purchased from the MSKCC pharmacy and diluted accordingly in saline.
MiR30-based shRNAs targeting p65 and Renilla (as a control) were cloned into the XhoI EcoRI locus of the MSCV-based LMP vector ( Chicas et al., 2010; Chien et al., 2011 16.

Control of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype by NF-κB promotes senescence and enhances chemosensitivity Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :2125-2136 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar ). Retroviruses were packaged by co-transfection of Gag-Pol expressing 293 T cells with expression constructs and envelope vectors (VSV-G) using the calcium phosphate method, and virus containing media applied to target KPC mut cells. Infected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 5 days. Knockdown was confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (following transplantation into C57BL/6 mice).
For p65 knockdown studies in KPC mut organoids, virus containing media was collected in AdDMEM supplemented with 1X P/S and 2mM glutamine and mixed 1:1 with full organoid media. Organoids were treated with virus overnight twice and subsequently selected for 1 week with 1μg/ml puromycin. Knockdown was confirmed by immuhistochemistry following transplantation into C57BL/6 mice.
Mice were treated with vehicle, trametinib (1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg body weight), and/or palbociclib (100 mg/kg body weight) per os for 4 consecutive days followed by 3 days off treatment. Gemcitabine (100 mg/kg body weight) was administered twice per week, or an α-PD-1 antibody (200 μg; RMP1-14, BioXcell) was given 3 times per week by intraperitoneal (IP) injection alone or in combination with trametinib and palbociclib treatment concurrently. Gemcitabine was also given on an alternating treatment schedule with T/P, where T/P was given on 4 consecutive days followed by 3 days off treatment for 1 week, followed by gemcitabine administration twice a week for 1 week. For PDX models propogated in NSG mice, gemcitabine was administered once per week. No obvious toxicities were observed in the vehicle- or drug-treated animals as assessed by changes in body weight (taking tumor size into account).
High doses of an α-VEGFR-2 blocking antibody (800 μg; DC101, BioXcell) were administered twice per week by IP injection to block neo-vascularization. For NK cell depletion, mice were injected IP with an α-NK1.1 antibody (250 μg; PK136, BioXcell) twice per week. For T cell depletion, mice were injected IP with either an α-CD4 (200 μg; GK1.5, BioXcell) or α-CD8 antibody (200 μg; 2.43, BioXcell) twice per week. Depletion of NK, CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells was confirmed by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analysis of pancreas tumor tissue. For neutralization of cell surface molecules that mediate immune-endothelial interactions, mice were injected IP with either an α-VCAM-1 (200 μg; M/K-2.7, BioXcell), α-PSGL-1 (50 μg; 4RA10, BioXcell), or α-ICAM-1 antibody (200 μg; YN1/1.7.4, BioXcell) twice per week. For neutralization of SASP factors, mice were injected IP with either an α-VEGFR2 (800 μg; DC101, BioXcell), α-IL-6 (200 μg; MP5-20F3, BioXcell), α-TGF-β (300 μg; 1D11.16.8, BioXcell), α-IL-1β (200 μg; B122, BioXcell), CCL-5 (50 μg; 53405, R&D systems), or CXCL-1 antibody (25 μg, 48415, R&D systems) twice per week.
High-contrast ultrasound imaging was performed on a Vevo 2100 System with a MS250 13- to 24-MHz scanhead (VisualSonics) to stage and quantify pancreas tumor burden. Tumor volume was analyzed using Vevo LAB software.
Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to track luciferase expression in orthotopically transplanted KPC mut PDAC tumor cells expressing a LUC-GFP reporter. Mice were injected IP with luciferin (5 mg/mouse; Gold Technologies) and then imaged on a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum imager (PerkinElmer) 10-15 minutes later for 60 s. Quantification of luciferase signaling was analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences).
PDAC-bearing KPC mut organoid transplant and KPC flox GEMM mice were pretreated for 2 weeks with vehicle or combined trametinib (1 mg/kg body weight) and palbociclib (100 mg/kg body weight) per os for 4 consecutive days followed by 3 days off treatment. To assess vascular permeability following treatment, 1 mg of FITC–dextran (MW 2,000,000; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered intravenously in the lateral tail vein 30 minutes before sacrifice. Similarly, to measure vascular perfusion/patency, 100 μg of biotinylated tomato lectin (B1175; Vector Laboratories) was injected intravenously 1 hour before sacrifice. To assess hypoxia in PDAC tissue, 60 mg/kg hydoxyprobe (Hypoxyprobe; HP1-100 kit) was administered by IP injection 30 minutes prior to euthanasia.
To assess gemcitabine uptake into pancreas tumors, 14 C-gemcitabine (specific activity 58.8 mCi/mmol; Moravek Biochemicals) was administered in sterile saline by IP injection at 2 μCi/animal. Animals were euthanized 2 hours after 14 C-gemcitabine administration, and tumor tissue, as well as tissue from normal pancreas and other organs were collected for downstream analysis. Tumors were divided for scintillation counting and autoradiography. Fragments of tumor (approximately 100 mg) were weighed and dissolved in Solvable™ (Perkin Elmer, Waltham MA), followed by 100 mL hydrogen peroxide, and counted in 7 mL Ultima Gold™ (Perkin Elmer). Activity was expressed as disintegrations per minute (dpm)/milligram. Autoradiographs were obtained from flash-frozen tumor cryosections, exposed to GE storage phosphor screens for 7 days and read with the Typhoon FLA 7000 laser scanner (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Before exposure, slides were marked with nail polish containing a blue dye and 14 C to permit registration of autoradiographic and microscopic images.
For in vivo sample preparation, tumors were isolated following removal of the spleen and normal pancreas tissue, and allocated for 10% formalin fixation, OCT frozen blocks, snap frozen tissue, and flow cytometry analysis following 2-week treatment. To prepare single cell suspensions for flow cytometry analysis, tumors were minced with scissors into small pieces and placed in 5ml of collagenase buffer (1x HBSS w/ calcium and magnesium (GIBCO), 1 mg/ml Collagenase V (C9263; Sigma), and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (DN25; Sigma)). Samples were then transferred to C tubes and processed using program 37C_m_TDK1_1 on a gentleMACS Octo dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec). Dissociated tissue was passaged through a 70 μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 1500 rpm x 5 minutes. Red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (Quality Biological) for 5 minutes, and samples were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. Samples were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (FC block, BD Pharmigen) for 20 minutes and then incubated with the following antibodies for 30 minutes on ice: CD45 (30-F11), NK1.1 (PK136), CD3 (17A2), CD8 (53-6.7), CD4 (GK1.5), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), PD-L1 (CD274;10F.9G2), CD31 (390), VCAM-1 (CD106;MVCAM.A), P-selectin (CD62P; RMP-1), CD69 (H1.2F3), CTLA-4 (CD152; UC10-4B9), 2B4 (CD244.2; m2B4 (B6)458.1), VLA-4 (CD49d; R1-2), F4/80 (BM8), PD-1 (CD279; RMP1-30), CD44 (IM7), CD86 (GL-1), CD206 (MMR), Ly6G (1A8) (Biolegend); CD11b (M1/70) (BD Biosciences); MHC-I (H-2k b ; AF6-88.5.5.3), LAG-3 (eBioC9B7W) (eBioscience); and ICAM-1 (AB796) (R&D Systems). DAPI was used to distinguish live/dead cells, and tumor cells were gated as GFP + in the KPC mut PDAC cell line transplant model where tumor cells harbor a LUC-GFP construct. Flow cytometry was performed on an LSRFortessa, and data were analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar).
Mice were injected intravenously with 250 μL of a solution containing 25 μg anti-CD107a PE (ID4B, Biolegend) in 1X PBS 3 hours before mice were euthanized. Pancreas tumor tissue was then isolated, dissociated, stained with cell surface antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above.
Tissues were fixed overnight in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 μm sections. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome staining were performed using standard protocols. For frozen sections, pancreata were directly embedded in OCT (VWR Chemicals, 361603E) and frozen on dry ice. For immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis, sections were de-paraffinized, rehydrated, and boiled in a microwave for 15 minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C.
The following primary antibodies were used: pERK T202/Y204 (4370), cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) (9664), PDGFRβ (3169), NF-κB (p65;8242) (Cell Signaling); Ki67 (AB16667), CD31 (AB28364), α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA;AB5694), CD3 (AB5690), granzyme B (AB4059), LYVE1 (AB14917) (Abcam); pRB S807/S811 (Sc-16670) (Santa Cruz); NKp46 (AF2225), VCAM-1 (AF643), ICAM-1 (AF796) (R&D Systems); FOXP3 (14-5773-82), CD8 (14-0808-82) (eBioscience); mouse pan-endothelial cell antigen (MECA-32) (University of Iowa); P-selectin (LS-B3578) (LSBio); FAP (ABT11) (Millipore); CD31 (DIA-310) (Dianova); biotinylated hyaluronic acid binding protein (HABP) (AMS.HKD-BC41; AMSBIO); and cytokeratin 19 (CK19; TROMA-III) (DSHB).
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vectastain Elite ABC HRP Kits) were applied for 30 minutes and visualized with DAB (Vector Laboratories; SK-4100), or secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 dye-conjugated antibodies (Life Technologies) applied for 1 hour at room temperature. Fluorescence antibody-labeled slides were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade mountant (Prolong Molecular Probes; P36934) after counterstaining with DAPI.
Analysis of protein adducts of reductively activated pimonidazole were identified through immunohistochemistry in fixed tissues with a monoclonal antibody against hypoxyprobe-1 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Hypoxyprobe; HP1-100 kit). To assess lectin perfusion, PDAC tissue sections isolated from mice injected with biotinylated tomato lectin (B1175; Vector Laboratories) were stained with a fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (SA-5001: Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes and processed as described above.
SA-β-gal staining was performed at pH 6.0 for human cells and 5.5 for mouse cells and tissue. Fresh frozen sections of pancreas tumor tissue, or adherent cells plated in 6-well plates and treated for 8 days in culture with vehicle (DMSO), trametinib (25nM), and/or palbociclib (500nM), were fixed with 0.5% Gluteraldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS supplemented with 1mM MgCl 2 , and stained for 5–8 hours in PBS containing 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1mg/ml X-Gal, and 5 mM each of Potassium ferricyanide and Potassium ferrocyanide. Tissue sections were counterstained with eosin. 5 high power fields per well/section were counted and averaged.
PDAC cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated for 6 days in the presence or absence of trametinib (25nM) and/or palbociclib (500nM). On day 6, 2 mL of serum-free or complete DMEM was added to each well and cells were incubated an additional 48 hours in the presence or absence of drugs. Conditioned media was then collected and the cells were trypsinized and counted using a cellometer (Nexcelom Biosciences). After normalizing the concentration of the conditioned media by the cell count, conditioned media from vehicle- or T/P-pretreated KPC mut PDAC tumor cells was then applied to endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and bone marrow-derived macrophages to assess changes in growth, or used for downstream cytokine array analysis.
Conditioned media samples (collected in complete DMEM) from treated PDAC cell lines or primary pancreatic murine fibroblasts (plated in triplicate) were normalized based on cell number by diluting with complete DMEM. Aliquots (50 μl) of the conditioned media were analyzed using multiplex immunoassays designed for human (Human Cytokine/Chemokine Array 42-Plex Discovery Assay) or mouse (Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array 31-Plex or MMP Discovery Array 5-Plex Discovery Assay) from Eve Technologies. Biological replicates were averaged to determine cytokine levels. Heatmaps display relative cytokine expression values normalized to vehicle-treated samples.
KPC mut tumor cells were treated with vehicle or combined trametinib (25nM) and palbociclib (500nM) for 6 days, and conditioned serum-free DMEM was collected as described above. Filtered conditioned media (CM) or basal serum-free media was then applied to various primary and established cell lines. To measure endothelial cell and fibroblast growth, 5,000 3B11 murine endothelial cells and 10,000 primary murine pancreatic fibroblasts were plated in 24-well dishes. Cells were counted daily in quadruplicate using a Guava Easycyte (Millipore) and media changed every 3 days. To analyze the impact on macrophage growth, 10,000 bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were plated in 96 well dishes and, one day thereafter, were exposed to CM or basal serum-free media diluted 1:2 in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 ng/mL Csf1. Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
3B11 endothelial cells were plated in 48 well dishes coated with a 150 μL layer of Cultrex reduced growth factor basement membrane extract (3533-005-02; R&D Systems) and cultured in basal or serum-free conditioned DMEM media for 8 hours. Images of tube structures were captured on a INCell 6000 high-content imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) at 10x magnification.
Spleens were harvested from female OT-1 mice (Jackson laboratory), mechanically disrupted by passing them through a 70 μm cell strainer, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm x 5 minutes. Red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (Quality Biological) for 5 minutes. Total splenocytes or CD8 + T cells FACS sorted on a Sony MA900 were then activated with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (one bead/T cell, Thermo Fisher) and cultured in presence of IL-2 (2 ng/ml; Biolegend), IL-7 (2.5 ng/ml; Peprotech) and IL-15 (50 ng/ml; Peprotech) in complete RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin for four to six days prior to co-culture assays with PDAC cells.
To generate KPC mut PDAC cells expressing chicken ovalbumin ( KPC mut -OVA), KPC mut PDAC cells were transduced with a pCDH-derived lentiviral vector expressing amino acids 48-386 of the chicken ovalbumin protein under the control of a minimal CMV promoter and a blasticidin resistance cassette under the control of an EF1-α promoter. Lentiviruses were packaged by co-transfection of 293 T cells with the expression construct, envelope vector (VSV-G), and lenti Gag-Pol vector using the calcium phosphate method. Selection of OVA-expressing tumor cells was performed with blasticidin (10 μg/ml; Thermo Fisher) over 3 days.
For analysis of expression of cytokines and activation markers on CD8 + T cells, total splenocytes were co-cultured for 4 hours with KPC mut or KPC mut -OVA PDAC tumor cells (pretreated with vehicle or combined trametinib (25nM) and palbociclib (500nM) (T/P) for 8 days) at a 1:1 effector to target (E:T) ratio in complete RPMI. To functionally block MHC-I activity, T cells were also co-cultured with tumor cells in the presence of a H-2k b blocking antibody (40 μg/ml; Y-3, BioXcell). As a positive control for T cell activation, cells were treated for 4 hours with PMA (20 ng/ml, sigma aldrich) and Ionomycin (1 μg/ml, stem cell technologies). Co-culture experiments were performed either in the absence (surface staining) or in the presence (intracellular cytokine staining) of GolgiStop (BD Biosciences). Cell surface staining was performed with CD8 (53-6.7), CD44 (IM7) and CD69 (H1.2F3) antibodies (Biolegend) for those cells that were not pretreated with GolgiStop. GolgiStop-pretreated cells were first stained with CD8 (53-6.7) antibody, then intracellular staining was performed using the Foxp3/transcription factor staining buffer set (eBioscience), where cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then stained with IFN-γ (XMG1.2; TONBO Biosciences) and TNF-α (MP6-XT22; eBiosciences) antibodies. Expression of cytokines and activation markers was evaluated by gating on CD8 + T cells. Flow cytometry was performed on an LSRFortessa, and data were analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar).
To assess the functionality of PDAC-infiltrating lymphocytes ex vivo , PDAC tumors isolated from KPC mut organoid transplant mice treated for two weeks with vehicle, combined trametinib (1 mg/kg body weight) and palbociclib (100 mg/kg), and/or an α-PD-1 antibody (200 μg; RMP1-14, BioXcell) were dissociated into single cell suspensions, incubated for 4 hours with PMA (20 ng/ml, sigma aldrich) and Ionomycin (1 μg/ml, stem cell technologies), and stained with CD8, IFN-γ, and TNF-α antibodies for flow cytometry analysis as above.
For analysis of macrophage polarization following T/P treatment, total RNA was extracted from CD45 + CD11b + Gr-1 - F4/80 + macrophages (sorted on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences)) isolated from KPC mut transplant PDAC tumors treated for 2 weeks with vehicle or combined trametinib (1 mg/kg body weight) and palbociclib (100 mg/kg) using TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagents (Invitrogen). Total RNA was also extracted from indicated KPC mut PDAC cell lines following 8 day treatment with vehicle or trametinib (25nM) and palbociclib (500nM) in culture using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was obtained using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed in duplicate or triplicate using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Invitrogen). 36B4 served as an endogenous normalization control.
For RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptional profiles of tumor cells from KPC mut transplant PDAC tumors in mice treated for 2 weeks with vehicle or combined trametinib (1 mg/kg body weight) and palbociclib (100 mg/kg), total RNA was extracted from GFP + tumor cells (sorted on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences)) using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Purified polyA mRNA was subsequently fragmented, and first and second strand cDNA synthesis performed using standard Illumina mRNA TruSeq library preparation protocols. Double stranded cDNA was subsequently processed for TruSeq dual-index Illumina library generation. For sequencing, pooled multiplexed libraries were run on a HiSeq 2500 machine on RAPID mode. Approximately 10 million 76bp single-end reads were retrieved per replicate condition. Resulting RNA-Seq data was analyzed by removing adaptor sequences using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 8. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (13125) PubMed Google Scholar ), aligning sequencing data to GRCh37.75(hg19) with STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 28. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (8544) PubMed Google Scholar ), and genome wide transcript counting using HTSeq ( Anders et al., 2015 3. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq--a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (6221) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate a RPKM matrix of transcript counts. Genes were identified as differentially expressed using R package DESeq2 with a cutoff of absolute log 2 FoldChange ≥ 1 and adjusted p value < 0.05 between experimental conditions ( Love et al., 2014 56. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (12911) PubMed Google Scholar ). Functional enrichments of these differential expressed genes were performed with enrichment analysis tool Enrichr ( Kuleshov et al., 2016 49. Kuleshov, M.V. ∙ Jones, M.R. ∙ Rouillard, A.D. ... Enrichr: a comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis web server 2016 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W90-7 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the retrieved combined score (log(p value) ∗ z -score) was displayed.
To assess expression of antigen presentation and processing genes in human PDAC cell lines treated with vehicle (DMSO), trametinib (25nM), and/or palbociclib (500nM) for 8 days in culture, we interrogated a previously published RNA-seq dataset from Ruscetti et al. (2018) 85. Ruscetti, M. ∙ Leibold, J. ∙ Bott, M.J. ... NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination Science. 2018; 362 :1416-1422 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar (GEO: GSE110397 ). Heatmaps display the fold change in RPKM expression values normalized to vehicle-treated samples.
Principal component analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package in R. Gene expressions of RNA-Seq data were clustered using hierarchical clustering based on one minus pearson correlation test. For pathway enrichment analysis, the weighted GSEA Preranked mode was used on a set of curated signatures in the molecular signatures database (MSigDB v6.2) ( https://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp ). From 17,810 signatures, signatures with 15-500 genes were only considered for the further analyses. From the results, enriched signatures with an adjusted p value less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
WES was conducted on genomic DNA (gDNA) isolated from PDAC tumors harvested at survival endpoint from KPC mut organoid transplant and KPC flox GEMM mice. gDNA was also isolated from peripheral blood of a non-tumor bearing C57/BL6 mouse to generate a baseline reference sequence. gDNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) and WES was conducted and sequenced by BGI. The data was then processed through the Illumina (HiSeq) Exome Variant Detection Pipeline for detecting variants by the Bioinformatics Core at MSKCC. First, the FASTQ files were processed to remove any adaptor sequences at the end of the reads using cutadapt (v1.6). The files were then mapped using the BWA mapper (bwa mem v0.7.12). After mapping the SAM files were sorted and read group tags added using the PICARD tools. After sorting in coordinate order the BAMs were processed with PICARD MarkDuplicates. The marked BAM files were then processed using the GATK toolkit (v 3.2) according to the best practices for tumor normal pairs. They were first realigned using ABRA (v 0.92) and then the base quality values recalibrated with the BaseQRecalibrator. Somatic variants were then called in the processed BAMs using muTect (v1.1.7) for SNV and the Haplotype caller from GATK with a custom post-processing script to call somatic indels. Mutations that occurred more than once among all in vivo mouse PDAC tumor samples, but did not appear in vitro prior to transplantation, were removed. Based on the information provided by Agilent SureSelect XT Mouse All Exon Kit, the total exome coverage was about 49.6MB. This coverage length was used to calculate mutations per MB and compared with publicly available mutational data downloaded from ( Alexandrov et al., 2013 1. Alexandrov, L.B. ∙ Nik-Zainal, S. ∙ Wedge, D.C. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative, ICGC Breast Cancer Consortium, ICGC MMML-Seq Consortium, ICGC PedBrain Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer Nature. 2013; 500 :415-421 Crossref Scopus (4094) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To measure endothelial tube formation in vitro , four fields per well were analyzed and grouped by well using Cell Profiler. In order to outline the whole cell/tube profile, the image was first processed using the EnhanceEdges function, followed by Smooth filters. The subsequent image was then thresholded to produce an outline object for the tube formation within each field. This object mask was then transformed with the skeletonize mask function and measurements on this skeleton used to determine tube length.
Quantification of the number of CD31 + blood vessels (mean vessel density), SA-β-gal + senescent cells, Ki67 + proliferating cells, CC3 + dead/dying cells, CD3 + and CD8 + T cells, and other immune and stromal cell types was performed on 5 high power 20x fields per section that were counted and averaged. The distance between blood vessels and tumor cells was determined for 20 randomly chosen blood vessels, and the distance to the four nearest tumors cells was measured and averaged using ImageJ software. Assessment of stromal reactivity was performed by scoring the number and intensity of the pixels by color deconvolution using Aperio software (IHC score) on trichrome, αSMA, and HA-stained sections.
Metastatic burden in the lungs and liver, as well as necrotic areas in primary PDAC lesions, were quantified from low magnification (1x) H&E-stained whole tissue sections. Tumor necrosis was assessed by the percentage of total tumor area covered in necrotic tissue on H&E-stained sections using ImageJ software.
To quantify colocalization of various markers with blood vessels, slides were first scanned with Pannoramic 250 Flash scanner (3DHistech, Hungary) using 20x/0.8NA objective lens. Regions of interest around the tissues were then drawn and exported as .tif files from these scans using Caseviewer (3DHistech, Hungary.) These images were then analyzed using ImageJ/FIJI (NIH, USA) where a median filter, thresholding, and watershedding were used to segment the nuclei in the DAPI channel. These segmented nuclei were then used to determine percent overlap between the different combinations of markers with their respective thresholds in order to quantify colocalization.
To assess lectin perfusion, PDAC tissue sections were co-stained with CD31, and the percentage of lectin + blood vessels was quantified. Hypoxia was assessed as the percentage of tumor tissue containing activated pimonidazole using ImageJ software. Vascular permeability was assessed by percentage of total tumor area that was FITC-dextran positive on fresh frozen sections.
Statistical significance between groups was calculated by two-tailed Student’s t test unless specified otherwise in the figure legend. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Group size was determined on the basis of the results of preliminary experiments and no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. The indicated sample size ( n ) represents biological replicates. Group allocation and outcome assessment were not performed in a blinded manner. All samples that met proper experimental conditions were included in the analysis. Survival was measured using the Kaplan–Meier method. Statistical significance was determined by one- and two-way ANOVA, Student’s t test, and log-rank test using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software) as indicated. Significance was set at p < 0.05.
