Title: HLA-DR15 Molecules Jointly Shape an Autoreactive T Cell Repertoire in Multiple Sclerosis


Abstract: Summary

The HLA-DR15 haplotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS), but our understanding of how it contributes to MS is limited. Because autoreactive CD4 + T cells and B cells as antigen-presenting cells are involved in MS pathogenesis, we characterized the immunopeptidomes of the two HLA-DR15 allomorphs DR2a and DR2b of human primary B cells and monocytes, thymus, and MS brain tissue. Self-peptides from HLA-DR molecules, particularly from DR2a and DR2b themselves, are abundant on B cells and thymic antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, we identified autoreactive CD4 + T cell clones that can cross-react with HLA-DR-derived self-peptides (HLA-DR-SPs), peptides from MS-associated foreign agents (Epstein-Barr virus and Akkermansia muciniphila ), and autoantigens presented by DR2a and DR2b. Thus, both HLA-DR15 allomorphs jointly shape an autoreactive T cell repertoire by serving as antigen-presenting structures and epitope sources and by presenting the same foreign peptides and autoantigens to autoreactive CD4 + T cells in MS.

Section: Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults and affects three times more women than men. Autoimmune inflammation, demyelination, and damage to neurons and axons are hallmarks of MS and lead to substantial disability. Together with high treatment costs, MS causes a heavy burden for individuals and society ( Reich et al., 2018 73. Reich, D.S. ∙ Lucchinetti, C.F. ∙ Calabresi, P.A. Multiple Sclerosis N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :169-180 Crossref Scopus (1486) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sospedra and Martin, 2005 82. Sospedra, M. ∙ Martin, R. Immunology of multiple sclerosis Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23 :683-747 Crossref Scopus (1867) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The etiology of MS involves environmental influences, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, smoking, and low vitamin D ( Olsson et al., 2017 62. Olsson, T. ∙ Barcellos, L.F. ∙ Alfredsson, L. Interactions between genetic, lifestyle and environmental risk factors for multiple sclerosis Nat. Rev.

The genetic association between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR15 and MS is the longest known for any autoimmune disease ( Jersild et al., 1973 41. Jersild, C. ∙ Fog, T. ∙ Hansen, G.S. ... Histocompatibility determinants in multiple sclerosis, with special reference to clinical course Lancet. 1973; 2 :1221-1225 Abstract Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may contribute up to 60% of the total genetic risk ( Oksenberg et al., 2008 60. Oksenberg, J.R. ∙ Baranzini, S.E. ∙ Sawcer, S. ... The genetics of multiple sclerosis: SNPs to pathways to pathogenesis Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9 :516-526 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). The DR15 haplotype contains two DR alleles that give rise to the molecules DRA ∗ 01:01P/DRB5 ∗ 01:01 (or DR2a) and DRA ∗ 01:01P/DRB1 ∗ 15:01 (or DR2b). The genes of the two DR15 allomorphs are in almost complete linkage disequilibrium in Caucasoids ( Fogdell et al., 1995 29. Fogdell, A. ∙ Hillert, J. ∙ Sachs, C. ... The multiple sclerosis- and narcolepsy-associated HLA class II haplotype includes the DRB5 ∗ 0101 allele Tissue Antigens. 1995; 46 :333-336 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is still widely held that MS risk is solely conferred by DR2b, and in many studies, the influence of DR2a has not been considered; for example, in a recent study of HLA associations with MS ( Moutsianas et al., 2015 57. Moutsianas, L. ∙ Jostins, L. ∙ Beecham, A.H. ..., International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) Class II HLA interactions modulate genetic risk for multiple sclerosis Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1107-1113 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ).
How the DR15 haplotype contributes to MS is not fully understood, but several mechanisms have been discussed for MS and other autoimmune diseases ( Dendrou et al., 2018 26. Dendrou, C.A. ∙ Petersen, J. ∙ Rossjohn, J. ... HLA variation and disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :325-339 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ), including aberrant HLA class II (HLA-II) molecule expression in an affected tissue ( Bottazzo et al., 1983 11. Bottazzo, G.F. ∙ Pujol-Borrell, R. ∙ Hanafusa, T. ... Role of aberrant HLA-DR expression and antigen presentation in induction of endocrine autoimmunity Lancet. 1983; 2 :1115-1119 Abstract Scopus (1016) PubMed Google Scholar ), strong HLA-II molecule expression on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) ( Cavalli et al., 2016 18.

Immunol. 2006; 176 :1951-1961 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). The best-known example of the latter is the shared epitope hypothesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated DR1 and DR4 alleles ( Gregersen et al., 1987 31. Gregersen, P.K. ∙ Silver, J. ∙ Winchester, R.J. The shared epitope hypothesis. An approach to understanding the molecular genetics of susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis Arthritis Rheum. 1987; 30 :1205-1213 Crossref Scopus (2205) PubMed Google Scholar ), which involves better binding of post-translationally modified (citrullinated) SPs ( Scally et al., 2013 78. Scally, S.W. ∙ Petersen, J. ∙ Law, S.C. ... A molecular basis for the association of the HLA-DRB1 locus, citrullination, and rheumatoid arthritis J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210 :2569-2582 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Several studies have demonstrated that HLA-derived SPs (HLA-SPs) contribute to HLA-II immunopeptidomes ( Chicz et al., 1992 21. Chicz, R.M. ∙ Urban, R.G. ∙ Lane, W.S. ...

Burroughs, A.K. ∙ Butler, P. ∙ Sternberg, M.J. ... Molecular mimicry in liver disease Nature. 1992; 358 :377-378 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), type 1 diabetes (T1D) ( Baum et al., 1995a 6. Baum, H. ∙ Brusic, V. ∙ Choudhuri, K. ... MHC molecular mimicry in diabetes Nat. Med. 1995; 1 :388 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), and RA ( Baum et al., 1995b 7. Baum, H. ∙ Wilson, C. ∙ Tiwana, H. ... HLA association with autoimmune disease: restricted binding or T-cell selection? Lancet. 1995; 346 :1042-1043 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on sequence comparison between peptides from the three different sources. That HLA-SPs from HLA-I and -II molecules can indeed stimulate T cells has been shown by several studies ( Chen et al., 1990 20. Chen, B.P. ∙ Madrigal, A. ∙ Parham, P.

HLA-DR15-derived self-peptides are involved in increased autologous T cell proliferation in multiple sclerosis Brain. 2013; 136 :1783-1798 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Albani et al.

Med. 1995; 1 :448-452 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar noted that peptides with the sequence QKRAA derived from DR molecules with the shared epitope in RA exist in the E. coli and human heat shock protein DnaJ and can be recognized by synovial fluid-infiltrating T cells in RA.
Accordingly, DR15 molecules and their immunopeptidomes might act in MS at multiple steps, including thymic selection of autoreactive T cells, maintenance/expansion in the periphery, activation by peptides from MS-associated pathogens, and by presenting disease-relevant autoantigens in the brain. This speculation is supported in part by earlier findings that memory B cells and the SPs presented by DR15 molecules can be involved in increased autoproliferation and brain homing of autoreactive CD4 + T cells in MS ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mohme et al., 2013 55. Mohme, M. ∙ Hotz, C. ∙ Stevanovic, S. ... HLA-DR15-derived self-peptides are involved in increased autologous T cell proliferation in multiple sclerosis Brain. 2013; 136 :1783-1798 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Certain infections, particularly with EBV, are thought to lead to marked immune activation and stimulate autoreactive T cells via molecular mimicry between foreign agents and myelin peptides ( Wucherpfennig and Strominger, 1995 97. Wucherpfennig, K.W. ∙ Strominger, J.L. Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein Cell. 1995; 80 :695-705 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBV establishes latent infection in B cells and drives their activation and differentiation, which might contribute to MS pathogenesis as APCs or via pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies ( Lünemann et al., 2007 52. Lünemann, J.D. ∙ Kamradt, T. ∙ Martin, R. ... Epstein-barr virus: environmental trigger of multiple sclerosis? J. Virol. 2007; 81 :6777-6784 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the DR15 haplotype alone increases MS risk approximately 3-fold and 15-fold together with environmental risk factors ( Olsson et al., 2017 62. Olsson, T. ∙ Barcellos, L.F. ∙ Alfredsson, L. Interactions between genetic, lifestyle and environmental risk factors for multiple sclerosis Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2017; 13 :25-36 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Thus, the present study aimed to address how the immunopeptidomes presented by both DR15 allomorphs, DR2a and DR2b, on different APCs in the thymus, peripheral blood, and brain could be involved in shaping an autoimmune T cell repertoire and how environmental triggers might contribute to activating potentially autoreactive CD4 + T cells.

Section: Results

The virtually complete linkage disequilibrium of the two DR15 allomorphs ( Figure 1 A) was highlighted by HLA genotyping over 1,000 MS patients ( Figure 1 B). 51.14% of them were DRB1 ∗ 15:01 + , and, as shown previously ( Fogdell et al., 1995 29. Fogdell, A. ∙ Hillert, J. ∙ Sachs, C. ... The multiple sclerosis- and narcolepsy-associated HLA class II haplotype includes the DRB5 ∗ 0101 allele Tissue Antigens. 1995; 46 :333-336 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), 99.90% of DRB1 ∗ 15:01 + MS patients were also DRB5 ∗ 01:01 + ( Figure 1 C). Very rarely (0.85%), DRB5 ∗ 01:01 could be found in DRB1 ∗ 15:01 − individuals ( Figure 1 C; Robbins et al., 1997 74. Robbins, F. ∙ Hurley, C.K. ∙ Tang, T. ... Diversity associated with the second expressed HLA-DRB locus in the human population Immunogenetics. 1997; 46 :104-110 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, both DR15 allomorphs should be considered when examining genetic risk factors and how they influence cellular immunity in MS.
Several studies have shown, albeit indirectly, the importance of memory B cells as cytokine producers and APCs in MS and its animal model ( Hauser et al., 2008 33. Hauser, S.L. ∙ Waubant, E. ∙ Arnold, D.L. ..., HERMES Trial Group B-cell depletion with rituximab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis N. Engl. J.

B cells in autoimmune and neurodegenerative central nervous system diseases Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2019; 20 :728-745 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore focused on immunopeptidomes of peripheral blood B cells and another type of prominent APCs: monocytes. High-affinity, allele-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were generated to isolate peptide/DR2a and peptide/DR2b complexes ( Figure S1 A). Both antibodies displayed high specificity and affinity for the respective DR15 molecule ( Figures 1 D, 1E, and S1 B). The DR15 + donors, including 3 healthy donors (HDs), 3 untreated relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, and 3 RRMS patients treated with the anti-VLA4 antibody natalizumab (RRMS_NAT) ( Table S1 ) were chosen for immunopeptidome analyses. These donors did not express other DR alleles that could be recognized by the two allele-specific antibodies ( Figure S1 B; Table S1 ). RRMS_NAT patients were of interest because of increased number and activation of blood B cells ( Planas et al., 2012 67. Planas, R. ∙ Jelčić, I. ∙ Schippling, S. ... Natalizumab treatment perturbs memory- and marginal zone-like B-cell homing in secondary lymphoid organs in multiple sclerosis Eur. J. Immunol. 2012; 42 :790-798 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) and elevated autoproliferation of T and B cells ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flow cytometry testing with anti-DR2a and anti-DR2b antibodies showed comparable expression levels of DR2a and DR2b on B cells and monocytes in HDs and MS patients ( Figure S1 C) but higher DR2a expression on both cell types ( Figure S1 D), as observed previously using allele-specific IgM antibodies ( Prat et al., 2005 70. Prat, E. ∙ Tomaru, U. ∙ Sabater, L. ... HLA-DRB5 ∗ 0101 and -DRB1 ∗ 1501 expression in the multiple sclerosis-associated HLA-DR15 haplotype J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 167 :108-119 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Next we analyzed DR2a and DR2b immunopeptidomes of B cells and monocytes by isolating peptide/DR2a and peptide/DR2b complexes with the allele-specific antibodies and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Comparison of unique ( Figure S2 A) and total peptides showed no significant difference for DR2a-presented unique peptides between B cells and monocytes ( Figure S2 B; Table S2 ), but the total eluted peptides from DR2a on RRMS_NAT B cells was higher compared with RRMS B cells and RRMS_NAT monocytes ( Figure S2 B), probably because of higher numbers of activated blood B cells in RRMS_NAT ( Planas et al., 2012 67. Planas, R. ∙ Jelčić, I. ∙ Schippling, S. ... Natalizumab treatment perturbs memory- and marginal zone-like B-cell homing in secondary lymphoid organs in multiple sclerosis Eur. J. Immunol. 2012; 42 :790-798 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Comparison of DR2b-presented peptides showed no significant difference between groups, only lower unique and total peptides on RRMS B cells compared with RRMS monocytes ( Figure S2 C; Table S3 ). Thus, in general, the diversity of unique peptides and their total numbers on DR2a or DR2b are comparable for B cells and monocytes and for HDs and MS patients. Further, the deduced amino acid preferences at the DR anchor positions p1, p4, and p9 for DR2a or p1, p4, and p7 for DR2b ( Vogt et al., 1994 96. Vogt, A.B. ∙ Kropshofer, H. ∙ Kalbacher, H. ... Ligand motifs of HLA-DRB5 ∗ 0101 and DRB1 ∗ 1501 molecules delineated from self-peptides J. Immunol. 1994; 153 :1665-1673 PubMed Google Scholar ) were largely similar for B cells and monocytes ( Figures 1 F and 1G), but differences at other positions implied different peptide sources of DR2a- or DR2b-presented peptides on B cells and monocytes.
Comparison of DR2a- or DR2b-presented peptides and source proteins between B cells and monocytes showed limited overlap, indicating cell-type-specific immunopeptidomes ( Figures 1 H, 1I, and S2 D–S2G). Likely explanations are the different protein expression profiles ( Figure S2 H) and/or differences in proteolytic enzymes in the antigen-processing compartments ( Villadangos and Ploegh, 2000 95. Villadangos, J.A. ∙ Ploegh, H.L. Proteolysis in MHC class II antigen presentation: who’s in charge? Immunity. 2000; 12 :233-239 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 I). Interestingly, ∼50% of the DR2a-presented peptides on B cells were HLA-SPs, particularly from HLA-II molecules (HLA-II-SPs), but much fewer HLA-SPs were found on DR2a of monocytes ( Figures 2 A and 2B), which also applied to DR2b-presented HLA-SPs ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Thus, DR2a and DR2b immunopeptidomes on B cells are enriched for HLA-SPs.
Considering the role of B cells in MS, we examined the source of the HLA-II-SPs in B cells in more detail. DR2a- and DR2b-presented HLA-II-SPs were mainly derived from DR molecules (HLA-DR-SPs) ( Figures 2 E and 2F, left panels), and DR2a preferentially presented SPs from DR β chains (HLA-DR-β-SPs), particularly from DRB1 and DRB5 ( Figure 2 E, right panel), whereas DR2b preferentially presented SPs from DR α chains (HLA-DR-α-SPs) ( Figure 2 F, right panel).
Among the B cell-presented HLA-DR-SPs, five peptides were particularly prominent. Four were mainly found on DR2a, including DRB1 (57–70) , DRB1 (72–86) , DRB5 (72–86) , and DRB1/5 (184–199) . The remaining one, DRA (70–85) , was more abundant on DR2b ( Figures 2 G and S3 A). Interestingly, all five could originate from DR2a and DR2b themselves ( Figure 2 G; Tables S2 and S3 ). Thus, on B cells of DR15 + individuals, DR2a and DR2b serve as antigen-presenting molecules and, at the same time, as an epitope source. We then examined whether presentation of these five HLA-DR-SPs was a general phenomenon or limited to certain APCs/tissues by analyzing the immunopeptidomes presented in the thymus from immunologically healthy DR15 + individuals and in the target organ of MS, the brain, of DR15 + MS patients ( Table S4 ). For the latter, we chose highly inflamed tissue samples. The five HLA-DR-SPs were also present in the DR2a and DR2b immunopeptidomes of thymic tissues but not MS brain tissues ( Figure 2 H).
The differential abundance of HLA-DR-SPs on DR2a and DR2b likely depends on the binding affinity to the respective allele. Among the DR2a-presented HLA-DR-SPs, DRB1 (72–86) was most frequent, followed by DRB1/5 (184–199) , DRB5 (72–86) , and DRB1 (57–70) ( Figure S3 A). This order corresponded to predicted binding affinities to DR2a ( Figure S3 B), which were much higher than those to DR2b ( Figure S3 C). Conversely, the DR2b-presented peptide DRA (70–85) had a much higher predicted binding affinity to DR2b than DR2a ( Figure S3 C). Although at much lower frequency, HLA-DR-β-SPs were also eluted from DR2b and, vice versa, the HLA-DR-α-SPs from DR2a in 8 of 9 individuals ( Figures S3 D and S3E), indicating that their differential presentation is not strictly limited to one of the two DR15 allomorphs. Regarding the location of HLA-DR-SPs within the HLA-DR molecules, DRA (70–85) was from the non-polymorphic DRA, whereas the four HLA-DR-β-SPs were from polymorphic areas of the DR β chains ( Figure S3 F). Next we wondered how frequently these peptides had been identified in the immunopeptidomes of DRB1 ∗ 15:01 + individuals versus those carrying other DR types in immunopeptidomes of over 600 samples from tumors, unaffected surrounding tissue, and blood samples in the HLA Ligand Atlas ( Marcu et al., 2019 53. Marcu, A. ∙ Bichmann, L. ∙ Kuchenbecker, L. ... The HLA Ligand Atlas. A resource of natural HLA ligands presented on benign tissues bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Each of the five HLA-DR-SPs had also been identified in DRB1 ∗ 15:01 − samples, but at much lower frequency than in DRB1 ∗ 15:01 + ( Figure S3 G). However, the anti-pan-HLA-DR (L243) and anti-DR/DP/DQ (Tü39) antibodies had been used in these studies, and, thus, the origin of the HLA-DR-SPs from DR2a or DR2b could not be assigned. These results suggest that HLA-DR-SPs are more common in DR15 + individuals.
Because increased autoproliferation of CD4 + T cells in MS is mediated by B cells and depends on T cell receptor (TCR)-peptide/DR interactions ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that the surface expression of DR2a and DR2b on B cells and the nature of HLA-DR-SPs might be important. Indeed, there is a tendency of higher autoproliferation with increasing HLA-DR-SPs presented by DR2a and DR2b on B cells from MS patients ( Figure S4 A). We then tested CD4 + T cell responses against these HLA-DR-SPs ( Table S5 ) in DR15 + HDs and MS patients. We used CD45RA-depleted (CD45RA − ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which include monocytes and memory T cells (CD4 + and CD8 + ) but not B and naive T cells ( Figure S4 B) to reduce background autoproliferation ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39.

HLA-DR15-derived self-peptides are involved in increased autologous T cell proliferation in multiple sclerosis Brain. 2013; 136 :1783-1798 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 C). CD45RA − PBMCs of 8 HDs and 14 MS patients (4 RRMS and 10 RRMS_NAT) ( Table S1 ) were tested with individual or pooled HLA-DR-SPs. Interestingly, cells of MS patients responded robustly to individual and pooled HLA-DR-SPs, whereas HDs responded much less ( Figure 3 A). Responses to CEF II peptide pool and tetanus toxin peptides, TT (830–844) and TT (947–967) , were not stronger in MS patients ( Figures 3 A and S4 D), indicating that there is no general hyperreactivity in MS patients. The response patterns in MS patients were heterogeneous with respect to recognition of individual peptides ( Figure S4 E). Proliferation could be blocked by an anti-HLA-DR antibody (Ab) ( Figure 3 B), and CD4 + T cells divided strongest ( Figure 3 C), indicating that memory CD4 + T cells recognize HLA-DR-SPs in the context of DR molecules. In contrast, naive CD4 + T cells did not respond to HLA-DR-SPs ( Figure 3 D). Regarding functional responses, we detected interferon γ (IFN-γ) and less interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17F in the supernatants of CD45RA − cells and purified CD4 + T cells upon stimulation with HLA-DR-SPs ( Figures 3 E and 3F), indicating that HLA-DR-SP-specific T cells possess a Th1 or polyfunctional Th1 ∗ phenotype. These data and expression of CCR6 and CXCR3 ( Figure 3 G), two chemokine receptors involved in brain homing ( Balashov et al., 1999 5. Balashov, K.E. ∙ Rottman, J.B. ∙ Weiner, H.L. ... CCR5(+) and CXCR3(+) T cells are increased in multiple sclerosis and their ligands MIP-1alpha and IP-10 are expressed in demyelinating brain lesions Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Immunol. 2009; 10 :514-523 Crossref Scopus (964) PubMed Google Scholar ), are consistent with the phenotype of autoproliferating CD4 + T cells ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, HLA-DR-SPs may promote proliferation, migration, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines of memory CD4 + cells in DR15 + MS patients upon TCR-peptide/DR contact.
We next asked whether DR2a and DR2b contributed to CD4 + T cell responses against HLA-DR-SPs. For this purpose, we employed APCs expressing a single DR heterodimer, a bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) B cell line lacking HLA-II expression, that was transfected with DRA and DRB1 ∗ 15:01 (BLS-DR2b cells) or DRB5 ∗ 01:01 (BLS-DR2a cells). Purified blood CD4 + T cells from DR15 + MS patients were co-cultured with irradiated BLS-DR2a or BLS-DR2b cells and stimulated with HLA-DR-SPs. HLA-DR-SPs activated memory CD4 + T cells when presented by DR2a and DR2b, and proliferation could be blocked by the anti-HLA-DR Ab. Very few CD45RA + naive CD4 + T cells responded ( Figure 4 A). IFN-γ was detected in supernatants when BLS-DR2a and BLS-DR2b cells were used as APCs ( Figure 4 B). Thus, DR2a and DR2b can promote proliferation of memory CD4 + T cells in DR15 + MS patients by presenting HLA-DR-SPs.
To explore the potential role of HLA-DR-SP-specific memory CD4 + T cells in MS, we first stimulated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-infiltrating CD4 + T cells from DR15 + MS patients ( Table S6 ) with HLA-DR-SPs, assuming that T cells from the CNS compartment were more likely to be associated with MS. CSF-infiltrating CD4 + T cells in 2 of 9 MS patients responded to HLA-DR-SPs presented by DR2a and 4 of 9 when presented by DR2b ( Figure 4 C). Thus, CD4 + T cells recognizing HLA-DR-SPs in the context of both DR15 allomorphs can be found in the CSF in a substantial fraction of patients. Because very few or no HLA-DR-SPs could be found in the immunopeptidomes of brain APCs ( Figure 2 H), HLA-DR-SPs are likely not involved in intra-parenchymal re-stimulation or direct brain damage by autoreactive CD4 + T cells.
We next addressed whether HLA-DR-SP-responsive CD4 + T cells recognized putative MS autoantigens by stimulating CD45RA − PBMCs of MS patients with pooled HLA-DR-SPs and generating HLA-DR-SP-specific T cell lines ( Figures S5 A and S5B; Table S1 ). Testing with myelin peptide pools and known individual peptides that are targets of high-avidity CD4 + T cells in MS, brain-infiltrating CD4 + T cells in MS, or encephalitogenic in animals ( Bielekova et al., 2004 9. Bielekova, B. ∙ Sung, M.H. ∙ Kadom, N. ... Expansion and functional relevance of high-avidity myelin-specific CD4+ T cells in multiple sclerosis J.

Planas, R. ∙ Santos, R. ∙ Tomas-Ojer, P. ... GDP-l-fucose synthase is a CD4 + T cell-specific autoantigen in DRB3 ∗ 02:02 patients with multiple sclerosis Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaat4301 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) demonstrated that HLA-DR-SP-specific CD4 + T cells recognized these autoantigens on DR2a and DR2b ( Figures 4 D and S5 B). Among the recognized individual peptides, myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide MBP (83–99) was also represented in MBP pool 3 and RASGRP2 (78–87) in RASGRP2 pool 2 ( Figures 4 D and S5 B). To further examine this aspect, we tested whether MBP (83–99) -specific and RASGRP2 (78–87) -specific autoreactive T cell clones (TCCs) recognized HLA-DR-SPs. We selected the three well-characterized autoreactive CD4 + TCCs TCC3A6, TCC5F6, and TCC14, all from DR15 + MS patients. When testing these TCCs with individual and pooled HLA-DR-SPs, MBP (83–99) -specific TCC3A6 and TCC5F6 did not respond to HLA-DR-SPs, whereas RASGRP2 (78–87) -specific TCC14 recognized DRB1 (57–70) , DRB1/5 (184–199) , and the HLA-DR-SPs pool ( Figure 4 E) and produced Th2 cytokines ( Figure 4 F). However, the stimulatory strength of DRB1 (57–70) and DRB1/5 (184–199) was much lower than that of RASGRP2 (78–87) ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Responses to DRB1 (57–70) and DRB1/5 (184–199) could be blocked by the anti-HLA-DR Ab ( Figure 4 G), indicating that they are presented by DR2b.
These results indicate that DR2a and DR2b as well as their presented HLA-DR-SPs may participate in MS pathogenesis by activation and/or maintenance of autoreactive CD4 + T cells through cross-reactivity.
Dose titration of RASGRP2 (78–87) and the two HLA-DR-SPs showed that TCC14 recognized RASGRP2 (78–87) with high functional avidity (EC 50 = 0.015 μM), but DRB1 (57-–70) and DRB1/5 (184–199) with much lower avidity ( Figure 5 A). Expression of the activation markers CD69 and CD25 further supported this notion ( Figure 5 B). DRB1 (57–70) and DRB1/5 (184–199) are therefore weak or partial agonists, whereas the potentially “pathogenic” SP RASGRP2 (78–87) is a strong agonist. Thus, DRB1 (57–70) and DRB1/5 (184–199) might be involved in peripheral maintenance but not full activation of TCC14.
We next addressed whether the above observations with a single RASGRP2 (78–87) -specific TCC also held for other MS patients by stimulating CD45RA − PBMCs from 3 RRMS_NAT patients with RASGRP2 (78–87) to generate specific TCCs ( Table S1 ). We chose RRMS_NAT patients based on previous data showing that autoreactive T cells are enriched in peripheral blood because of the inhibition of migration to the brain/CSF ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Memory CD4 + T cells from RRMS_NAT-1 and RRMS_NAT-2 responded to RASGRP2 (78–87) ( Figure 5 C), and new RASGRP2 (78–87) -specific TCCs were isolated from both ( Figure 5 D). Multiple TCCs from RRMS_NAT-2 responded to RASGRP2 (78–87) and DRB1 (57–70) ( Figure 5 D), consistent with the marked proliferation of CD45RA − PBMCs from this patient to DRB1 (57–70) ( Figure S4 E). Five of the new CD4 + TCCs, 1159AG_TCC1–TCC5, reacting to RASGRP2 (78–87) and DRB1 (57–70) , were identified ( Figure 5 E). All were DR2b restricted ( Figure 5 F) but different from TCC14, displayed a Th1/Th1 ∗ phenotype ( Figure 5 E), and secreted IFN-γ upon stimulation with RASGRP2 (78–87) ( Figure 5 G). Testing 1159AG_TCCs against another HLA-DR-SP that TCC14 recognized, DRB1/5 (184–199) , showed that only 1159AG_TCC3 responded with proliferation ( Figure 5 H) but 4 of 5 with IFN-γ secretion ( Figure 5 I). Importantly, like TCC14, reactivity to DRB1 (57–70) and DRB1/5 (184–199) was weaker than against RASGRP2 (78–87) for all 1159AG_TCCs ( Figures 5 D, 5H, and 5I). Thus, cross-reactivity between HLA-DR-SPs and RASGRP2 is frequent in MS patients, and the main role of HLA-DR-SPs is likely in homeostatic maintenance of autoreactive memory CD4 + T cells in DR15 + MS patients by low-avidity interactions between TCR and HLA-DR-SP/DR complexes on B cells.
The above findings led us to ask why RASGRP2-specific CD4 + T cells could be identified relatively easily in DR15 + MS patients. Immunodominance of peptides and a higher frequency of autoreactive T cells with specificity for peptides of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), proteolipid protein (PLP), or MBP have been linked to the absence of thymic expression ( Bruno et al., 2002 14. Bruno, R. ∙ Sabater, L. ∙ Sospedra, M. ... Multiple sclerosis candidate autoantigens except myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein are transcribed in human thymus Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32 :2737-2747 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Klein et al., 2000 43. Klein, L. ∙ Klugmann, M. ∙ Nave, K.A. ... Shaping of the autoreactive T-cell repertoire by a splice variant of self protein expressed in thymic epithelial cells Nat. Med. 2000; 6 :56-61 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ) or low DR binding affinity ( Muraro et al., 1997 58. Muraro, P.A. ∙ Vergelli, M. ∙ Kalbus, M. ... Immunodominance of a low-affinity major histocompatibility complex-binding myelin basic protein epitope (residues 111-129) in HLA-DR4 (B1 ∗ 0401) subjects is associated with a restricted T cell receptor repertoire J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100 :339-349 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Regarding RASGRP2, we analyzed its gene expression in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) from DR15 + individuals; i.e., the cells that mediate negative selection to remove high-avidity autoreactive T cells and establish central tolerance ( Klein et al., 2014 44. Klein, L. ∙ Kyewski, B. ∙ Allen, P.M. ... Positive and negative selection of the T cell repertoire: what thymocytes see (and don’t see) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :377-391 Crossref Scopus (937) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to MOG and PLP ( Bruno et al., 2002 14. Bruno, R. ∙ Sabater, L. ∙ Sospedra, M. ... Multiple sclerosis candidate autoantigens except myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein are transcribed in human thymus Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32 :2737-2747 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Klein et al., 2000 43. Klein, L. ∙ Klugmann, M. ∙ Nave, K.A. ... Shaping of the autoreactive T-cell repertoire by a splice variant of self protein expressed in thymic epithelial cells Nat. Med. 2000; 6 :56-61 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar , 2014 44. Klein, L. ∙ Kyewski, B. ∙ Allen, P.M. ... Positive and negative selection of the T cell repertoire: what thymocytes see (and don’t see) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :377-391 Crossref Scopus (937) PubMed Google Scholar ), RASGRP2 expression was absent or at the detection threshold in TECs ( Figure S5 C), explaining how RASGRP2-specific autoreactive CD4 + T cells could escape negative selection and be found relatively frequently in the periphery.
Different from RASGRP2, DRA, DRB1, and DRB5 were highly expressed in TECs ( Figure S5 D), and HLA-DR-SPs were present in the DR2a and DR2b immunopeptidomes from DR15 + thymic tissues ( Figure 2 H). Although not formally shown for thymocytes, high-avidity RASGRP2-specific CD4 + T cells, which cross-reacted to HLA-DR-SPs with much lower avidity, might be positively selected in the thymus and subsequently be maintained in the periphery by the latter. This had been speculated after the first demonstration that MHC-SPs are part of the MHC class II-presented immunopeptidome ( Baum et al., 1995b 7. Baum, H. ∙ Wilson, C. ∙ Tiwana, H. ... HLA association with autoimmune disease: restricted binding or T-cell selection? Lancet. 1995; 346 :1042-1043 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kourilsky and Claverie, 1989 45. Kourilsky, P. ∙ Claverie, J.M. MHC restriction, alloreactivity, and thymic education: a common link? Cell. 1989; 56 :327-329 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ).
HLA-DR-SPs can be viewed as “selecting/homeostatic” SPs that can participate in thymic selection and/or homeostatic maintenance of potentially autoreactive CD4 + T cells. However, their full activation probably involves stronger ligands; e.g., peptides from foreign agents. It is well known that the DR15 haplotype amplifies the effect of certain environmental risk factors for MS, most notably of altered immunity to EBV ( Olsson et al., 2017 62. Olsson, T. ∙ Barcellos, L.F. ∙ Alfredsson, L. Interactions between genetic, lifestyle and environmental risk factors for multiple sclerosis Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2017; 13 :25-36 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ). This effect may be mediated by molecular mimicry between peptides from EBV and SPs, which are presented by DR15 molecules and cross-recognized by autoreactive CD4 + T cells ( Planas et al., 2018 69. Planas, R. ∙ Santos, R. ∙ Tomas-Ojer, P. ... GDP-l-fucose synthase is a CD4 + T cell-specific autoantigen in DRB3 ∗ 02:02 patients with multiple sclerosis Sci. Transl.

Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein Cell. 1995; 80 :695-705 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar ). To address this point, we chose EBV and another pathogen implicated in MS, a bacterial taxon overrepresented in gut microbiota of MS patients, Akkermansia muciniphila ( Berer et al., 2017 8. Berer, K. ∙ Gerdes, L.A. ∙ Cekanaviciute, E. ... Gut microbiota from multiple sclerosis patients enables spontaneous autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2017; 114 :10713-10718 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jangi et al., 2016 38. Jangi, S. ∙ Gandhi, R. ∙ Cox, L.M. ... Alterations of the human gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12015 Crossref Scopus (873) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used data from testing TCC14 with combinatorial peptides libraries and a dedicated biometrical analysis ( Zhao et al., 2001 100. Zhao, Y. ∙ Gran, B. ∙ Pinilla, C. ... Combinatorial peptide libraries and biometric score matrices permit the quantitative analysis of specific and degenerate interactions between clonotypic TCR and MHC peptide ligands J. Immunol. 2001; 167 :2130-2141 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) to predict potentially stimulatory peptides from EBV and Akkermansia ( Figure S6 A). The scores of all decapeptides from both agents ranged between 20 and 125, well below the theoretical maximum score of 190.88 for TCC14 ( Figure S6 B). Previous studies had shown a positive relationship between peptides with predicted high scores and T cell responses ( Sospedra et al., 2010 84. Sospedra, M. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Giulianotti, M. ... Combining positional scanning peptide libraries, HLA-DR transfectants and bioinformatics to dissect the epitope spectrum of HLA class II cross-restricted CD4+ T cell clones J. Immunol. Methods. 2010; 353 :93-101 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore selected peptides from EBV (n = 33) and Akkermansia (n = 30) with scores between 75 and 125 ( Figure S6 B; Table S7 ), synthesized and tested them with TCC14. Indeed, two EBV and nine Akkermansia peptides gave positive responses ( Figure 6 A). As controls, we chose a herpesvirus negatively associated with MS, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) ( Sundqvist et al., 2014 87. Sundqvist, E. ∙ Bergström, T. ∙ Daialhosein, H. ... Cytomegalovirus seropositivity is negatively associated with multiple sclerosis Mult. Scler. 2014; 20 :165-173 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a bacterium considered protective for MS, Prevotella histicola ( Shahi et al., 2019 80. Shahi, S.K. ∙ Freedman, S.N. ∙ Murra, A.C. ... Prevotella histicola , A Human Gut Commensal, Is as Potent as COPAXONE® in an Animal Model of Multiple Sclerosis Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :462 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ), and again selected peptides with scores of 75–125 ( Figure S6 C; Table S7 ). TCC14 did not react to any peptide from these two agents ( Figure 6 B). Compared with DRB1 (57–70) and DRB1/5 (184–199) , two EBV and four Akkermansia peptides exhibited stronger effects ( Figure 6 A). Further, some peptides from EBV and Akkermansia activated TCC14 comparably with RASGRP2 (78–87) , based on upregulation of CD69 and CD25, downregulation of surface TCR ( Figure 6 C), and production of Th2 cytokines ( Figure 6 D). To address the stimulatory hierarchy in more detail, we performed transcriptional profiling by RNA sequencing and found that the up- and downregulation of a broad range of genes corresponded to the stimulatory strength of the peptides ( Figure 6 E). Regarding the rank order of broad sets of genes related to activation, proliferation, and Th2 function, EBV and Akkermansia peptides were stronger than HLA-DR-SPs and close to RASGRP2 (78–87) ( Figure 6 F). However, the upregulation of genes related to cytotoxicity and/or pathogenesis of MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), including GZMB (Granzyme B), FASLG (Fas ligand), CSF2 (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]), and IL-3, was more pronounced with RASGRP2 (78–87) compared with EBV and Akkermansia peptides ( Figure 6 F). Moreover, when testing 1159AG_TCCs with peptides that had been selected from foreign agents for TCC14, two Akkermansia peptides also stimulated proliferation ( Figure 6 G) and IFN-γ production ( Figures 6 H, S6 D, and S6E), whereas all peptides from HCMV and Prevotella were negative ( Figures S6 F and S6G). These data suggest that the MS-associated foreign agents EBV and Akkermansia might be involved in activation/expansion of autoreactive memory CD4 + T cells via molecular mimicry.
Besides T cell cross-reactivity, others and we have shown that the same and/or different peptides can be recognized by a single TCR in the context of several HLA-II molecules, including DR2a and DR2b ( Lang et al., 2002 48. Lang, H.L. ∙ Jacobsen, H. ∙ Ikemizu, S. ... A functional and structural basis for TCR cross-reactivity in multiple sclerosis Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3 :940-943 Crossref Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yousef et al., 2012 99. Yousef, S. ∙ Planas, R. ∙ Chakroun, K. ... TCR bias and HLA cross-restriction are strategies of human brain-infiltrating JC virus-specific CD4+ T cells during viral infection J. Immunol. 2012; 189 :3618-3630 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 7 A and S7 ). We referred to this characteristic as HLA cross-restriction and wanted to find out whether an autoreactive CD4 + T cell recognized the above peptides in the context of both DR15 allomorphs. Indeed, TCC14 reacted to RASGRP2 (78–87) presented by DR2a and DR2b and maintained its Th2 phenotype, although the response to RASGRP2 (78–87) /DR2a was lower ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Further, transcriptome analysis indicated that TCC14 responded to RASGRP2 (78–87) presented by DR2a and DR2b in a similar manner, although restriction by DR2b was always more efficient ( Figures 7 D and 7E). Like TCC14, the DR2b-restricted 1159AG_TCC2, 1159AG_TCC3, and 1159AG_TCC5 also reacted to RASGRP2 (78–87) presented by DR2a ( Figure 7 F) and maintained their Th1/Th1 ∗ phenotype ( Figure 7 G). In addition to RASGRP2 (78–87) , one EBV and three Akkermansia peptides activated TCC14 together with DR2a ( Figure 7 H), but less strongly than RASGRP2 (78–87) ( Figure 7 I). These data demonstrate another facet of the cooperative effects of the two MS-associated DR15 allomorphs that extends beyond serving as antigen-presenting molecule and epitope source. It appears that the structures of DR2a and DR2b after binding foreign peptides from EBV and Akkermansia or autoantigenic peptide from RASGRP2 are sufficiently similar to activate a TCC like TCC14.

Section: Discussion

The HLA gene complex, one of the most polymorphic regions of the genome, has evolved under the pressure of pathogens, and the high prevalence of certain HLA molecules in populations of distinct geographic areas and ethnicity is explained by this interplay ( Blackwell et al., 2009 10. Blackwell, J.M. ∙ Jamieson, S.E. ∙ Burgner, D. HLA and infectious diseases Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2009; 22 :370-385 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a downside, fitness to cope with dangerous pathogens in the context of certain HLA molecules comes at the price of misguided immune responses. In the field of HLA genotyping, it has long been known that DRB1 ∗ 15:01 and DRB5 ∗ 01:01 are found to be virtually 100% linked in Caucasoids, the ethnic group with the highest MS prevalence ( Tiercy et al., 1991 92. Tiercy, J.M. ∙ Jeannet, M. ∙ Mach, B. Oligonucleotide typing analysis for the linkage disequilibrium between the polymorphic DRB1 and DRB5 loci in DR2 haplotypes Tissue Antigens. 1991; 37 :161-164 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further confirm this here for over 500 northern European DR15 + MS patients. Despite this knowledge, one striking aspect of MS genetics research has been its focus on DRB1 ∗ 15:01/DR2b, with a recent study being most representative ( Moutsianas et al., 2015 57. Moutsianas, L. ∙ Jostins, L. ∙ Beecham, A.H. ..., International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) Class II HLA interactions modulate genetic risk for multiple sclerosis Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1107-1113 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas only few examined DRB5 ∗ 01:01/DR2a ( Caillier et al., 2008 17. Caillier, S.J. ∙ Briggs, F. ∙ Cree, B.A. ...

Med. 1994; 179 :279-290 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is in part due to the fact that common variants are spaced sufficiently tightly to assign DRB1 ∗ but not DRB3 ∗ , DRB4 ∗ and DRB5 ∗ genes ( Dilthey et al., 2011 27. Dilthey, A.T. ∙ Moutsianas, L. ∙ Leslie, S. ... HLA ∗ IMP--an integrated framework for imputing classical HLA alleles from SNP genotypes Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :968-972 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Regarding the functional role of DR2a, one study has shown protective effects of DRB5 ∗ 01:01 in humanized transgenic mice in which co-expression of DR2a lowers the disease susceptibility conferred by DRB1 ∗ 15:01 ( Gregersen et al., 2006 32. Gregersen, J.W. ∙ Kranc, K.R. ∙ Ke, X. ... Functional epistasis on a common MHC haplotype associated with multiple sclerosis Nature. 2006; 443 :574-577 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another noted faster conversion to progressive MS in African-American MS patients who expressed DRB1 ∗ 15:03 and no DRB5 ∗ 01:01, indicating that the latter is not required for MS ( Caillier et al., 2008 17. Caillier, S.J. ∙ Briggs, F. ∙ Cree, B.A. ... Uncoupling the roles of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB5 genes in multiple sclerosis J. Immunol. 2008; 181 :5473-5480 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). But our own data, including (1) spontaneous EAE in humanized transgenic mice expressing an MS patient-derived, MBP-specific TCR and DRB5 ∗ 01:01( Quandt et al., 2012 71. Quandt, J.A. ∙ Huh, J. ∙ Baig, M. ... Myelin basic protein-specific TCR/HLA-DRB5 ∗ 01:01 transgenic mice support the etiologic role of DRB5 ∗ 01:01 in multiple sclerosis J. Immunol. 2012; 189 :2897-2908 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ); (2) the pro-inflammatory phenotype of DR2a-restricted myelin-specific TCC ( Hemmer et al., 1997 34. Hemmer, B. ∙ Vergelli, M. ∙ Tranquill, L. ... Human T-cell response to myelin basic protein peptide (83-99): extensive heterogeneity in antigen recognition, function, and phenotype Neurology. 1997; 49 :1116-1126 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ); (3) the higher DR2a expression on several APCs and in the brain ( Prat et al., 2005 70.

Med. 1994; 179 :279-290 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ) argue that DR2a should be considered an MS-associated genetic risk factor. Whether SNPs in the DRB5 ∗ 01:01 gene are related to differential methylation and DR expression, as has been shown for DRB1 ∗ 15:01, should be considered in the future ( Kular et al., 2018 47.

We analyzed the immunopeptidomes of both DR15 allomorphs on primary B cells, an APC type, which a number of indirect approaches identified as important for MS pathogenesis ( Hauser et al., 2008 33.

Different from prior studies of immunopeptidomes from EBV-transformed B cell lines, BLS-DR2a or BLS-DR2b cells ( Scholz et al., 2017 79. Scholz, E.M. ∙ Marcilla, M. ∙ Daura, X. ...

Sequence analysis of peptides bound to MHC class II molecules Nature. 1991; 353 :622-627 Crossref Scopus (1030) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined primary B cells. The B cell- and monocyte-derived immunopeptidomes disclosed similar binding motifs as prior data ( Vogt et al., 1994 96. Vogt, A.B. ∙ Kropshofer, H. ∙ Kalbacher, H. ... Ligand motifs of HLA-DRB5 ∗ 0101 and DRB1 ∗ 1501 molecules delineated from self-peptides J. Immunol. 1994; 153 :1665-1673 PubMed Google Scholar ), but B cell-derived peptides differed from monocytes in that 20%–50% of peptides presented by DR2a and DR2b on B cells originated from HLA-II molecules and almost exclusively from DR2a and DR2b themselves, although they were also found on monocytes. HLA-I-SPs and HLA-II-SPs have been shown previously in the DR2a/DR2b-presented immunopeptidomes ( Mohme et al., 2013 55. Mohme, M. ∙ Hotz, C. ∙ Stevanovic, S. ... HLA-DR15-derived self-peptides are involved in increased autologous T cell proliferation in multiple sclerosis Brain. 2013; 136 :1783-1798 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scholz et al., 2017 79. Scholz, E.M. ∙ Marcilla, M. ∙ Daura, X. ... Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DRB1 ∗ 15:01 and HLA-DRB5 ∗ 01:01 Present Complementary Peptide Repertoires Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :984 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vogt et al., 1994 96. Vogt, A.B. ∙ Kropshofer, H. ∙ Kalbacher, H. ... Ligand motifs of HLA-DRB5 ∗ 0101 and DRB1 ∗ 1501 molecules delineated from self-peptides J. Immunol. 1994; 153 :1665-1673 PubMed Google Scholar ), but their high prevalence on primary B cells was not known. Also, that most peptides on DR2a stemmed from the DR β chain whereas those on DR2b originated primarily from the DR α chain is novel. A few peptides, albeit with varying lengths, thus occupied a considerable fraction of surface DR2a and DR2b on peripheral blood B cells. Thus, disease-associated DR15 molecules can serve as antigen-presenting structures and sources of epitopes. In one prior study, variations of three of the five HLA-DR-SPs had been eluted from DR molecules of dendritic cells (DCs)-depleted thymic APCs ( Adamopoulou et al., 2013 2. Adamopoulou, E. ∙ Tenzer, S. ∙ Hillen, N. ... Exploring the MHC-peptide matrix of central tolerance in the human thymus Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2039 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). The authors used a pan-HLA-DR Ab, and peptides could therefore not be assigned to one of the two DR15 allomorphs. Two of the five peptides could also be isolated from thymic DCs ( Adamopoulou et al., 2013 2. Adamopoulou, E. ∙ Tenzer, S. ∙ Hillen, N. ... Exploring the MHC-peptide matrix of central tolerance in the human thymus Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2039 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ); therefore, some of the HLA-DR-SPs, which are abundant on peripheral blood B cells and thymic tissues, may act during CD4 + T cell selection. We did not differentiate TECs, DC types, or thymic B cells ( Klein et al., 2014 44. Klein, L. ∙ Kyewski, B. ∙ Allen, P.M. ... Positive and negative selection of the T cell repertoire: what thymocytes see (and don’t see) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :377-391 Crossref Scopus (937) PubMed Google Scholar ) and therefore do not know how HLA-DR-SPs may contribute to positive and negative selection. Cortical TECs are most likely involved in positively selecting HLA-DR-SP-reactive T cells, whereas those with high avidity are probably deleted by negative selection ( Klein et al., 2014 44. Klein, L. ∙ Kyewski, B. ∙ Allen, P.M. ... Positive and negative selection of the T cell repertoire: what thymocytes see (and don’t see) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :377-391 Crossref Scopus (937) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is compatible with our observation that naive CD4 + T cells did not respond to HLA-DR-SPs but were probably homeostatically maintained whereas memory CD4 + T cells did.
Memory CD4 + T cells downregulate their activation threshold after activation by high-avidity ligands ( Stefanová et al., 2002 86. Stefanová, I. ∙ Dorfman, J.R. ∙ Germain, R.N. Self-recognition promotes the foreign antigen sensitivity of naive T lymphocytes Nature. 2002; 420 :429-434 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as the peptides from the two MS-associated pathogens EBV and Akkermansia . Interestingly, the EBV-derived peptides are from the lytic viral gene products BHRF1 and BPLF1, which drive lymphocytosis during mononucleosis ( Taylor et al., 2015 89. Taylor, G.S. ∙ Long, H.M. ∙ Brooks, J.M. ... The immunology of Epstein-Barr virus-induced disease Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33 :787-821 Crossref Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ), which strongly raises the risk to develop MS ( Olsson et al., 2017 62. Olsson, T. ∙ Barcellos, L.F. ∙ Alfredsson, L. Interactions between genetic, lifestyle and environmental risk factors for multiple sclerosis Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2017; 13 :25-36 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ). BHRF1- and BPLF1-specific CD4 + T cells could be primed aberrantly during mononucleosis and confer risk for MS development. After differentiation into memory cells, we assume, but cannot show in vivo , that HLA-DR-SPs are involved in homeostatic maintenance of these CD4 + T cells and also in autoproliferation ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mohme et al., 2013 55. Mohme, M. ∙ Hotz, C. ∙ Stevanovic, S. ... HLA-DR15-derived self-peptides are involved in increased autologous T cell proliferation in multiple sclerosis Brain. 2013; 136 :1783-1798 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we considered HLA-DR-SPs as “selecting/homeostatic” SPs in the thymus and peripheral blood, respectively, where they might participate in shaping a TCR repertoire that confers protection against MS-associated foreign agents but can also potentially respond to pathogenic SPs from RASGRP2 or myelin, as shown for memory CD4 + T cells, such as the brain-infiltrating TCC14, which recognized not only the putative MS autoantigen RASGRP2 ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also several HLA-DR-SPs and peptides derived from EBV and Akkermansia . Regarding the antigen hierarchy, HLA-DR-SPs are weak agonists, EBV and Akkermansia peptides are full agonists, and the RASGRP2 peptide is an even stronger ligand. High-avidity recognition of a potentially “pathogenic” SP like RASGRP2 (78–87) fits with the absence of thymic transcription, as shown before for PLP ( Klein et al., 2000 43. Klein, L. ∙ Klugmann, M. ∙ Nave, K.A. ... Shaping of the autoreactive T-cell repertoire by a splice variant of self protein expressed in thymic epithelial cells Nat. Med. 2000; 6 :56-61 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ) and MOG ( Bruno et al., 2002 14. Bruno, R. ∙ Sabater, L. ∙ Sospedra, M. ... Multiple sclerosis candidate autoantigens except myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein are transcribed in human thymus Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32 :2737-2747 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ).
At present, we do not know whether and under which conditions RASGRP2 expression might start in vivo in peripheral blood B cells or in the target organ brain. However, we assume that recognition of this peptide by naive CD4 + T cells that had been selected by HLA-DR-SPs and converted to memory CD4 + T cells by recognizing EBV or Akkermansia peptides may lead to their full activation in the periphery and/or the brain. This is not unique for TCC14 because we could easily isolate more pro-inflammatory TCCs with similar properties; i.e., cross-recognition of HLA-DR-SPs, RASGRP2, and Akkermansia . Our current data support that HLA-DR-SPs can be recognized as nominal antigens that share similarities with peptides from foreign antigens or potentially “pathogenic” SPs, but we cannot exclude that they may also act as co-agonists via integration in the immunological synapse ( Krogsgaard et al., 2005 46. Krogsgaard, M. ∙ Li, Q.J. ∙ Sumen, C. ... Agonist/endogenous peptide-MHC heterodimers drive T cell activation and sensitivity Nature. 2005; 434 :238-243 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ) or that the specificity of TCR is determined by recognizing the backbone of the HLA molecules ( Cai and Hafler, 2007 16. Cai, G. ∙ Hafler, D.A. Multispecific responses by T cells expanded by endogenous self-peptide/MHC complexes Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37 :602-612 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, how and whether recognition of the different peptides influences functional differentiation into specific Th subtypes ( Adair et al., 2016 1. Adair, P. ∙ Kim, Y.C. ∙ Pratt, K.P. ... Avidity of human T cell receptor engineered CD4(+) T cells drives T-helper differentiation fate Cell. Immunol. 2016; 299 :30-41 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) remains to be studied.
Assuming that both DR15 allomorphs jointly contribute to MS pathogenesis, it is curious that peptides from EBV and Akkermansia and from the potentially “pathogenic” RASGRP2 are recognized by TCC14 and additional clones in the context of both DR15 allomorphs. Others and we have previously observed HLA cross-restriction with brain-infiltrating John Cunningham (JC) polyomavirus-specific T cells ( Yousef et al., 2012 99. Yousef, S. ∙ Planas, R. ∙ Chakroun, K. ... TCR bias and HLA cross-restriction are strategies of human brain-infiltrating JC virus-specific CD4+ T cells during viral infection J. Immunol. 2012; 189 :3618-3630 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), with an MBP/EBV-specific CD4 + TCC from a DR15 + MS patient ( Lang et al., 2002 48. Lang, H.L. ∙ Jacobsen, H. ∙ Ikemizu, S. ... A functional and structural basis for TCR cross-reactivity in multiple sclerosis Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3 :940-943 Crossref Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ) and with CSF-infiltrating CD4 + T cells in MS ( Sospedra et al., 2006 83. Sospedra, M. ∙ Muraro, P.A. ∙ Stefanová, I. ... Redundancy in antigen-presenting function of the HLA-DR and -DQ molecules in the multiple sclerosis-associated HLA-DR2 haplotype J. Immunol. 2006; 176 :1951-1961 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). HLA cross-restriction of CD4 + T cells contributes to controlling HIV ( Galperin et al., 2018 30. Galperin, M. ∙ Farenc, C. ∙ Mukhopadhyay, M. ... CD4(+) T cell-mediated HLA class II cross-restriction in HIV controllers Sci. Immunol. 2018; 3 :eaat0687 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may also be critical for controlling viral infections in the brain, an immunoprivileged organ with low HLA-II expression ( Yousef et al., 2012 99. Yousef, S. ∙ Planas, R. ∙ Chakroun, K. ... TCR bias and HLA cross-restriction are strategies of human brain-infiltrating JC virus-specific CD4+ T cells during viral infection J. Immunol. 2012; 189 :3618-3630 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ability of a TCC to recognize cognate peptides on more than one HLA-II element may, however, also increase the risk of CNS damage by an autoreactive TCC. In the case of DR2a and DR2b, cross-restriction may involve similarities of the contact surfaces of the two molecules toward the TCR, whereas differences exist primarily in the peptide binding grooves ( Li et al., 2000 49. Li, Y. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Martin, R. ... Structural basis for the binding of an immunodominant peptide from myelin basic protein in different registers by two HLA-DR2 proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304 :177-188 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smith et al., 1998 81. Smith, K.J. ∙ Pyrdol, J. ∙ Gauthier, L. ... Crystal structure of HLA-DR2 (DRA ∗ 0101, DRB1 ∗ 1501) complexed with a peptide from human myelin basic protein J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188 :1511-1520 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the cooperation of DR2a and DR2b may increase the fitness to cope with viral infection but also the risk of pathogenic autoreactivity. A recent study documented that DR2a and DR2b are expressed highly in normal-appearing gray matter in MS brains ( Enz et al., 2019 28. Enz, L.S. ∙ Zeis, T. ∙ Schmid, D. ... Increased HLA-DR expression and cortical demyelination in MS links with HLA-DR15 Neurol. Neuroimmunol. Neuroinflamm. 2019; 7 :e656 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), the region where RASGRP2 is found in cortical neurons ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our data show the complexity of how the two MS-associated DR15 allomorphs could functionally contribute to MS as antigen-presenting structures and epitope sources during thymic selection and peripheral maintenance of a TCR repertoire. HLA-DR-SP-reactive CD4 + T cells could be activated by certain foreign agents like EBV and Akkermansia and then respond to potentially “pathogenic” SPs from RASGRP2 or autoantigens such as MBP in the blood and probably also the CSF/brain. At each step, DR2a and DR2b may serve as antigen-presenting structures, binding peptides from themselves, and be involved in cross-restriction. At present, we cannot provide solid evidence of every single step and in each compartment, particularly not in the selecting organ, the thymus, and the target, the brain. However, HLA-DR-SPs in the DR2a and DR2b immunopeptidomes in thymic tissues and peripheral blood B cells but not in the brain, activation of T cell responses against myelin and RASGRP2 by HLA-DR-SPs, and the recognition hierarchies of the HLA-DR-SPs versus EBV and Akkermansia peptides and RASGRP2 peptide are compatible with current concepts of T cell selection, peripheral maintenance, and full activation ( Boyman et al., 2009 12. Boyman, O. ∙ Létourneau, S. ∙ Krieg, C. ... Homeostatic proliferation and survival of naïve and memory T cells Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39 :2088-2094 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ; Takaba and Takayanagi, 2017 88. Takaba, H. ∙ Takayanagi, H. The Mechanisms of T Cell Selection in the Thymus Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :805-816 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In conclusion, DR2a and DR2b could jointly shape an autoreactive T cell repertoire in MS. Recognition of HLA-DR-SPs, potentially “pathogenic” SPs, and peptides from MS-associated pathogens demonstrates how the most important genetic risk factor may link immune reactivity to environmental risk factors and autoantigens at the level of TCR-peptide/DR recognition. The concepts of how HLA-SPs might be involved in molecular mimicry in autoimmune diseases like autoimmune hepatitis, RA, and T1D were formulated almost 30 years ago ( Baum et al., 1995a 6. Baum, H. ∙ Brusic, V. ∙ Choudhuri, K. ... MHC molecular mimicry in diabetes Nat. Med. 1995; 1 :388 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar , 1995b 7. Baum, H. ∙ Wilson, C. ∙ Tiwana, H. ... HLA association with autoimmune disease: restricted binding or T-cell selection? Lancet. 1995; 346 :1042-1043 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Burroughs et al., 1992 15. Burroughs, A.K. ∙ Butler, P. ∙ Sternberg, M.J. ... Molecular mimicry in liver disease Nature. 1992; 358 :377-378 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our experimental approaches outline how to address whether HLA-DR-SPs contribute to the strong associations between distinct HLA-DR molecules in a number of autoimmune diseases with clear HLA association, including RA, T1D, autoimmune thyroid disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, Goodpasture syndrome, narcolepsy, and others. The intriguing epidemiological and experimental data that exist for molecular mimicry between autoantigen and viral/bacterial pathogens in many of these diseases ( Cusick et al., 2012 24. Cusick, M.F. ∙ Libbey, J.E. ∙ Fujinami, R.S. Molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disease Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2012; 42 :102-111 Crossref Scopus (398) PubMed Google Scholar ) could be linked to T cell repertoire generation and maintenance by HLA-DR-SPs. Regarding therapeutic implications, blocking the T1D-associated HLA-DQ8 with the small molecule methyldopa inhibits formation of anti-insulin Abs and spontaneous disease in animals ( Ostrov et al., 2018 63. Ostrov, D.A. ∙ Alkanani, A. ∙ McDaniel, K.A. ... Methyldopa blocks MHC class II binding to disease-specific antigens in autoimmune diabetes J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :1888-1902 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another small molecule (PV-267) that fills the binding pocket of DR2b inhibits cytokine production and proliferation of DR2b-restricted, MBP-specific T cells and allows prevention and treatment in a DR2b-transgenic EAE model ( Ji et al., 2013 42. Ji, N. ∙ Somanaboeina, A. ∙ Dixit, A. ... Small molecule inhibitor of antigen binding and presentation by HLA-DR2b as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :5074-5084 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). The same inhibitor attenuates anti-glomerular basement membrane activity in a Goodpasture model ( Huynh et al., 2019 35. Huynh, M. ∙ Eggenhuizen, P.J. ∙ Olson, G.L. ... HLA-DR15-specific inhibition attenuates autoreactivity to the Goodpasture antigen J. Autoimmun. 2019; 103 :102276 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). In both studies, DR2a was not considered, and one may speculate that single small molecules blocking both alleles or combining blockers for DR2a and DR2b could be explored as immunotherapy for MS. Future studies should address whether our observations hold for other MS autoantigens, such as myelin peptides and the recently discovered non-myelin protein guanosine diphosphate (GDP) L-fucose synthase, which is recognized by brain-infiltrating T cells and has similarities to GDP L-fucose synthase homologs of certain gut microbiota, most notably Akkermansia ( Planas et al., 2018 69. Planas, R. ∙ Santos, R. ∙ Tomas-Ojer, P. ... GDP-l-fucose synthase is a CD4 + T cell-specific autoantigen in DRB3 ∗ 02:02 patients with multiple sclerosis Sci. Transl.

In a first cohort, peripheral blood samples from MS patients from the University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland (n = 136; age range 21-70 (median 41), F:M ratio: 1.5) and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany (n = 881; age range 20-79 (median 45), F:M ratio: 2.2) were collected for HLA genotyping. In a second cohort, leukaphereses or buffy coats were collected from 8 HDs, 4 RRMS, and 10 RRMS_NAT for HLA immunopeptidome analyses (HDs, n = 3; RRMS, n = 3; RRMS_NAT, n = 3), proliferation assays (HDs, n = 8; RRMS, n = 4; RRMS_NAT, n = 10), and T cell cloning (RRMS_NAT, n = 3). The detailed information of these samples is shown in Tables S1 . Leukaphereses from MS patients were collected at the Hematology Clinic, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. Buffy coats from HDs were acquired from the Blutspende Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. Thymic tissues from HLA-DR15 + immunologically healthy children undergoing cardiac surgery were collected at the University Children’s Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland (n = 4) for HLA immunopeptidome analyses (n = 4) and TEC isolation (n = 3). Highly inflamed MS brain tissues were collected from the UK MS Society Tissue Bank, Imperial College London, London, UK for HLA immunopeptidome analyses (n = 4). The detailed information of thymic and MS brain tissues is shown in Tables S4 . MS was diagnosed according to the recent McDonald criteria ( Thompson et al., 2018 91. Thompson, A.J. ∙ Banwell, B.L. ∙ Barkhof, F. ... Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria Lancet Neurol. 2018; 17 :162-173 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4457) PubMed Google Scholar ). The study was approved by the Cantonal Ethical Committee of Zurich, Switzerland (EC-No. of the research project 2013-0001, approved on 5th June 2013 and EC-No. of the ERC 2014-0699, approved on 27th February 2015). HLA genotyping of MS patients from Hamburg was approved under protocol No. 2758, Ethik Kommission der Ärztekammer Hamburg.
BLS-DR2a and BLS-DR2b cells originated from a bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) patient-derived B cell line transfected with the genes encoding DRA ∗ 01:01P/DRB5 ∗ 01:01 (BLS-DR2a cells) or DRA ∗ 01:01P/ DRB1 ∗ 15:01 (BLS-DR2b cells). BLS cells were expanded in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Eurobio, Courtaboeuf, France), 2mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin (Corning, New York, USA), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Corning), and 50 μg/mL gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich).
TCC3A6, TCC5F6, and TCC14 were obtained from HLA-DR15 + MS patients. TCC3A6 is MBP (83-99) -specific and restricted by DR2a ( Vergelli et al., 1996 93. Vergelli, M. ∙ Hemmer, B. ∙ Utz, U. ... Differential activation of human autoreactive T cell clones by altered peptide ligands derived from myelin basic protein peptide (87-99) Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26 :2624-2634 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Its TCR recognizes MBP (83-99) with low avidity ( Li et al., 2005 50. Li, Y. ∙ Huang, Y. ∙ Lue, J. ... Structure of a human autoimmune TCR bound to a myelin basic protein self-peptide and a multiple sclerosis-associated MHC class II molecule EMBO J. 2005; 24 :2968-2979 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), but is encephalitogenic in a humanized transgenic mouse model ( Quandt et al., 2012 71. Quandt, J.A. ∙ Huh, J. ∙ Baig, M. ... Myelin basic protein-specific TCR/HLA-DRB5 ∗ 01:01 transgenic mice support the etiologic role of DRB5 ∗ 01:01 in multiple sclerosis J. Immunol. 2012; 189 :2897-2908 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). TCC5F6 also recognizes MBP (83-99) but is restricted by DR2b ( Vergelli et al., 1997 94. Vergelli, M. ∙ Hemmer, B. ∙ Kalbus, M. ... Modifications of peptide ligands enhancing T cell responsiveness imply large numbers of stimulatory ligands for autoreactive T cells J. Immunol. 1997; 158 :3746-3752 PubMed Google Scholar ). Both TCC3A6 and TCC5F6 are Th1 cells ( Hemmer et al., 1997 34. Hemmer, B. ∙ Vergelli, M. ∙ Tranquill, L. ... Human T-cell response to myelin basic protein peptide (83-99): extensive heterogeneity in antigen recognition, function, and phenotype Neurology. 1997; 49 :1116-1126 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). TCC14 is a Th2 TCC generated from autoproliferating cells and clonally expanded in brain lesions of a pattern II MS patient (1175SA) ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ...

Planas, R. ∙ Metz, I. ∙ Ortiz, Y. ... Central role of Th2/Tc2 lymphocytes in pattern II multiple sclerosis lesions Ann. Clin. Transl. Neurol. 2015; 2 :875-893 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). It is restricted by DR2b and responds to RASGRP2 that is an autoantigen identified by an unbiased epitope search ( Zhao et al., 2001 100. Zhao, Y. ∙ Gran, B. ∙ Pinilla, C. ... Combinatorial peptide libraries and biometric score matrices permit the quantitative analysis of specific and degenerate interactions between clonotypic TCR and MHC peptide ligands J. Immunol. 2001; 167 :2130-2141 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) and expressed by pro-inflammatory B cells and in the brain ( Jelcic et al., 2018 39. Jelcic, I. ∙ Al Nimer, F. ∙ Wang, J. ... Memory B Cells Activate Brain-Homing, Autoreactive CD4(+) T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Cell. 2018; 175 :85-100. e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TCCs were expanded with irradiated allogeneic PBMCs (45 Gy), 1 μg/mL PHA (Sigma-Aldrich), and 20 U/ml human IL-2 (hIL-2 containing supernatant produced by T6 cell line that was kindly provided by F. Sallusto, IRB, Bellinzona, Switzerland) in IMDM medium (GE healthcare, Illinois, USA) containing 5% human serum (Blood Bank Basel, Switzerland), 2mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin (Corning), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Corning), and 50 μg/mL gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was changed by aspirating half of the old medium and adding the same amount of fresh medium containing hIL-2 every 3-4 days for two weeks.
PBMCs were freshly isolated from leukaphereses or buffy coats using Ficoll (Eurobio) density gradient centrifugation. Isolated PBMCs were cryopreserved in freezing medium containing 90% heat-inactivated FCS (Eurobio) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) and stored in liquid nitrogen.
CD4 + T cells in the CSF of HLA-DR15 + RRMS patients were purified by positive selection using CD4 microbeads, human (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Isolated bulk CD4 + T cells were seeded at 1.5 × 10 3 cells/well in 96-well U-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmunster, Austria) together with 1.5 × 10 5 irradiated allogeneic PBMC (45Gy), 1 μg/ml PHA (REMEL, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and hIL-2 in RPMI-1640 medium containing 5% human serum (Blood Bank Basel), 2 mM glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids (GIBCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% (vol/vol) sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), 5μM β-Mercaptoethanol (GIBCO), 100 U/ml penicillin (Corning), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Corning). The medium was changed by aspirating half of the old medium and adding the same amount of fresh medium containing hIL-2 every 3-4 days for up to 25 days until cells were fully rested.
DNA was extracted from whole blood of MS patients using a standard DNA isolation protocol using Triton lysis buffer (Triton X-100, Sigma-Aldrich) and proteinase K (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The genotype of HLA class I (A and B) and HLA class II (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1 and DQB1) alleles was determined using high-resolution HLA sequence-based typing (Histogenetics, New York, USA).
Thymic tissues from HLA-DR15 + immunologically healthy children undergoing cardiac surgery were cleaned from necrotic and connective tissue and then minced using watchmaker forceps. Minced tissues were digested in 12 mL PBS containing 0.4 mg/ml Liberase TM (Roche) and 20 μg/ml DNase I (Roche) in a 37°C water bath with pipetting up and down frequently until the tissue was completely dissolved. Cells were washed in AutoMACS running buffer (Miltenyi) and enriched for antigen-presenting cells using Percoll (GE healthcare) gradient centrifugation. Enriched antigen-presenting cells were stained for surface markers using fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, including anti-human CD45 antibody, anti-human CD326 (EpCAM) antibody, and anti-human HLA-DR antibody (Biolegend; Key Resources Table ). 1.0 × 10 5 of HLA-DR + TECs (CD45 − EpCAM + HLA-DR int-high ) were sorted from enriched antigen-presenting cells using a FACSAria III 4L (BD Biosciences) and resuspended in Qiazol (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) for RNA extraction.
BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with recombinant HLA-DRB5 ∗ 01:01 antigen to obtain DR2a allele-specific monoclonal antibody. CB6F1 mice were immunized and boosted with BLS-DR2b cells to obtain DR2b allele-specific monoclonal antibody. In particular, the aim was to obtain high-affinity IgG antibodies. The antibody-producing splenocytes were isolated and fused with Sp2/0 myeloma cells as fusion partner via polyethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich) to form hybridomas. The hybridomas were then cultured with 100 μM hypoxathine, 0.4 μM aminopterin, and 16 μM thymidine (HAT, Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI-1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Corning), 2mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Later, supernatants from hybridomas were collected and screened by cytotoxicity test and single antigen beads (One Lambda, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for DR2a and DR2b. Clones were screened by LABScreen single antigen HLA-II panel (One Lambda, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and picked based on immunoglobulin class and antigen specificity. Desired antibody-producing hybridomas were finally expanded in vitro and injected into the mouse to acquire ascitic fluid enriched for the specific antibodies. Characterization of reactivity against a broad panel of DR alleles is shown in Figure S1 B. Purified DR2a- and DR2b-specific antibodies were acquired and used for immunopeptidome isolation and immunofluorescence. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated DR2a-specific antibody and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated DR2b-specific antibody were acquired and used for flow cytometric analysis.
BLS-DR2a or BLS-DR2b cells were plated onto poly-L-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) -coated slides. The fixation, permeabilization, and blocking of nonspecific binding sites of the cells were performed using the Image-iT® Fix-Perm Kit (Invitrogen, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were then incubated with 10 μg/ml primary anti-DR2a or anti-DR2b antibody overnight at 4°C. Following several wash steps with PBS + 0.5% BSA, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 secondary antibody (Invitrogen) to target anti-DR2a antibody or 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b secondary antibody (Invitrogen) to target anti-DR2b antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were washed several times with PBS + 0.5% BSA and mounted with SlowFade Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen) and coverslips. The images were captured using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and analyzed using ImageJ (NIH).
For immunopeptidome isolation of blood B cells and monocytes, cryopreserved PBMCs from HLA-DR15 + donors were thawed and washed twice with serum-free X-VIVO 15™ medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). B cells and monocytes were then purified by positive selection using CD19 microbeads, human (Miltenyi) and CD14 microbeads, human (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified B cells and monocytes were collected and stored in −80°C until use. For the thymic tissues and highly inflamed MS brain tissues, immunopeptidomes were isolated directly using the frozen tissues.
To isolate the immunopeptidome presented by DR2a and DR2b, as previously described ( Nelde et al., 2019 59. Nelde, A. ∙ Kowalewski, D.J. ∙ Stevanović, S. Purification and Identification of Naturally Presented MHC Class I and II Ligands Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1988 :123-136 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), frozen B cell and monocyte pellets, thymic tissues, and MS brain tissues were lysed with 10 mM CHAPS (PanReac AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) with protease inhibitors (Roche) in PBS. The lysate was then ultrasonicated, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation and clarified using 5 μm sterile filters (Millex®-SV low protein binding PVDF Durapore® syringe filter unit, Merck Millipore). The peptide/HLA complexes were isolated from the supernatant using an immunoprecipitation approach with the allele-specific antibodies, and peptides were eluted from HLA molecules with 0.2% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Sigma-Aldrich). The peptides were separated from HLA molecules by ultracentrifugation using 10 kDa Amicon centrifugal filter units (Merck Millipore). The amino acid sequences of the eluted peptides were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, LTQ Orbitrap XL). The mass spectrometry immunopeptidomic raw data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE ( Perez-Riverol et al., 2019 64. Perez-Riverol, Y. ∙ Csordas, A. ∙ Bai, J. ... The PRIDE database and related tools and resources in 2019: improving support for quantification data Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D442-D450 Crossref Scopus (4992) PubMed Google Scholar ) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD015249.
For the immunopeptidome analysis, the core binding motif and binding affinity of peptides to DR2a or DR2b were predicted using NetMHCII 2.3 Server ( Jensen et al., 2018 40. Jensen, K.K. ∙ Andreatta, M. ∙ Marcatili, P. ... Improved methods for predicting peptide binding affinity to MHC class II molecules Immunology. 2018; 154 :394-406 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ). Graphical representation of the core binding motif was generated using iceLogo ( Colaert et al., 2009 23. Colaert, N. ∙ Helsens, K. ∙ Martens, L. ... Improved visualization of protein consensus sequences by iceLogo Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :786-787 Crossref Scopus (575) PubMed Google Scholar ). The analyzed results are shown in Tables S2 and S3 . The overlap of DR2a- and DR2b-presented unique peptides and the overlap of the source protein of DR2a- and DR2b-presented peptides between B cells and monocytes were analyzed using VENNY 2.1 ( Oliveros, 2007–2015 61. Oliveros, J.C. Venny. An interactive tool for comparing lists with Venn's diagrams 2007–2015 https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html Google Scholar ; https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html ).
All peptides used in this study for stimulation purposes were synthesized with N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amide (Peptides & Elephants, Hennigsdorf, Germany). RASGRP2 (78-87) : LVRYWISAFP; MBP (83-99) : ENPVVHFFKNIVTPRT; VP1 (74-88) : NRDMLPCYSVARIPL; EBNA1 (482–496) : AEGLRALLARSHVER; TT (830-844) : QYIKANSKFIGITEL; and TT (947-967) : FNNFTVSFWLRVPKVSASHLE. HLA-DR-SPs used for synthesis are shown in Table S5 .
For peptide stimulation assay of PBMCs, CD45RA − PBMCs were recovered after negative selection using CD45RA microbeads, human (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. CD45RA − PBMCs were seeded at 2 × 10 5 cells/well in 200 μl X-VIVO 15™ medium (Lonza) in 96-well U-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One), and HLA-DR-SPs were then added at a final concentration of 10 μM. 10-15 replicate wells were performed per condition, and anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 antibody-loaded MACSibead particles (Miltenyi) were used as a positive control. A pan-HLA-DR-specific antibody (L243) was added under some conditions to block the function of HLA-DR molecules at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Proliferation was measured at day 7 by 3 H-thymidine (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) incorporation assay. The proliferation strength is depicted as counts per minute (cpm) or stimulatory index (SI). The SI indicates the ratio of cpm in the presence of the peptide versus cpm in the no peptide control.
To dissect the cell subsets in the proliferative compartment of CD45RA − PBMCs after stimulating with HLA-DR-SPs, CD45RA − PBMCs were isolated and then labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Sigma-Aldrich). CFSE-labeled CD45RA − PBMCs were seeded at 2 × 10 5 cells/well in 200 μl X-VIVO 15™ medium (Lonza) in 96-well U-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One) and stimulated with HLA-DR-SPs pool. After 7 days, CFSE-labeled CD45RA − PBMCs were collected and pooled from replicate wells, stained for Live/Dead® Aqua (Invitrogen) and surface markers, and acquired with an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Resulting data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star).
To assess proliferation of blood CD4 + T cells upon co-culture with autologous monocytes, BLS-DR2a cells, or BLS-DR2b cells as APCs in the presence of HLA-DR-SPs, blood CD4 + T cells and monocytes were purified by negative selection using CD4 + T cell isolation kit, human (Miltenyi) and monocyte isolation kit, human (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Purified blood CD4 + T cells were labeled prior to co-culture with CFSE (Sigma-Aldrich). CFSE-labeled blood CD4 + T cells (5 × 10 4 cells/well) were incubated with autologous monocytes, irradiated BLS-DR2a cells, or irradiated BLS-DR2b cells (1 × 10 5 cells/well) as APCs in 200 μl X-VIVO 15™ medium (Lonza) in 96-well U-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One) and stimulated with HLA-DR-SPs pool at a final concentration of 10 μM. Anti-HLA-DR antibody (L243) was added under some conditions to block the interaction with HLA-DR molecules at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. After 7 days, cells were collected and pooled from replicate wells and stained for Live/Dead® Aqua (Invitrogen) and surface markers. The proliferation of naive (CD45RA + ) and memory (CD45RA − ) CD4 + T cells was measured using an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and resulting data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star).
For determining reactivity of CSF-infiltrating CD4 + T cells of HLA-DR15 + MS patients as shown in Table S6 to HLA-DR-SPs, CFSE-labeled CSF-infiltrating CD4 + T cells (5 × 10 4 cells/well) were incubated with irradiated BLS-DR2a cells or irradiated BLS-DR2b cells (1 × 10 5 cells/well) in 200 μl X-VIVO 15™ medium (Lonza) in 96-well U-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One) and stimulated with HLA-DR-SPs pool at a final concentration of 10 μM. Anti-HLA-DR antibody (L243) was added under some conditions to block the interaction with HLA-DR molecules at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. After 7 days, cells were collected and pooled from replicate wells and stained for Live/Dead® Aqua (Invitrogen) and surface markers. The proliferation of naive (CD45RA + ) and memory (CD45RA − ) CD4 + T cells was measured using an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and resulting data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star).
For proliferation assays of autoreactive TCCs stimulating with HLA-DR-SPs, TCCs (2 × 10 4 cells/well) were seeded with irradiated BLS-DR2a or BLS-DR2b cells (5 × 10 4 cells/well) as APCs in 200 μl X-VIVO 15™ medium (Lonza) in 96-well U-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One) and stimulated with HLA-DR-SPs pool at a final concentration of 10 μM. Cognate antigens were used as a positive control of stimulation. Proliferation was measured at day 3 by 3 H-thymidine (Hartmann Analytic) incorporation assay.
Supernatants were harvested from CD45RA − PBMCs, bulk CD4 + T cells, CSF-infiltrating CD4 + T cells at day 7 or from TCCs at day 3 after peptide stimulation. Cytokines in the supernatants were measured with a bead-based immunoassay using LEGENDplex Multi-analyte Flow Assay kit (Biolegend, California, USA; Human Th cytokine panel (13-plex) includes IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, -4, -5, -6, -9, -10, -13, -17A, -17F, -21, and -22) or with a ELISA using ELISA MAX Standard Set Human IFN-γ (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For analyzing DR2a and DR2b expression levels on B cells and monocytes, PBMCs from HLA-DR15 + donors were incubated with human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) to block unspecific antibody binding to Fc-receptors, labeled with Live/Dead® Aqua (Invitrogen), and then stained for surface marker using fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-DR2a antibody (5 μg/ml, One Lambda, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-DR2b antibody (5 μg/ml, One Lambda, Thermo Fisher Scientific), at 4°C. For analyzing CD69, CD25, and TCR α/β expression on TCCs after stimulation, TCCs were harvested at different time points after stimulating with peptides and washed twice with PBS. TCCs were then incubated with human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich), labeled with Live/Dead® Aqua (Invitrogen), and stained for surface marker using fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, including anti-human CD69 antibody, anti-human CD25 antibody, anti-human TCR α/β antibody, anti-human CD4 antibody, and anti-human CD3 antibody (Biolegend; Key Resources Table ), at 4°C. Cells were washed twice after staining and resuspended with cold PBS containing 2mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA, AppliChem) and 2% FCS (Eurobio). Measurement was performed using LSR Fortessa Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star).
To generate CD4 + TCCs that recognize both RASGRP2 (78-87) and HLA-DR-SPs, PBMCs from 3 HLA-DR15 + RRMS_NAT patients were stained with CFSE, and CD45RA − PBMCs were then isolated using CD45RA microbeads, human (Miltenyi) and stimulated with RASGRP2 (78-87) at a concentration of 10μM. Proliferating (CFSE dim ) CD4 + T cells were sorted at day 12 as single cells in 96-well U-bottom plates using SH800S Cell Sorter (Sony) and expanded with irradiated allogeneic PBMC (45 Gy), 1 μg/ml PHA (Sigma-Aldrich), and 20 U/ml hIL-2 in RPMI-1640 medium containing 5% heat-decomplemented human serum (Blood Bank Basel, Switzerland), 2mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin (Corning), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Corning), and 50 μg/mL gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was changed by aspirating half of the old medium and adding the same amount of fresh medium containing hIL-2 every 3-4 days.
Expanded TCCs were co-cultured with irradiated autologous PBMCs as APCs and stimulated with RASGRP2 (78-87) or HLA-DR-SPs to test their reactivity. TCCs that responded to both RASGRP2 (78-87) and HLA-DR-SPs were chosen for further study. The phenotype of TCRVβ chain of TCCs was first assessed by flow cytometry using fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (Beckman Coulter, USA; Key Resources Table ) and further confirmed by sequencing. The sequencing results were analyzed using IMGT/V-QUEST ( Brochet et al., 2008 13. Brochet, X. ∙ Lefranc, M.P. ∙ Giudicelli, V. IMGT/V-QUEST: the highly customized and integrated system for IG and TR standardized V-J and V-D-J sequence analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :W503-8 Crossref Scopus (910) PubMed Google Scholar ). The functional phenotype was analyzed by stimulating TCCs with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 antibody-loaded MACSibead particles (Miltenyi) in X-VIVO 15™ medium (Lonza), and after 3 days cytokines in supernatants were measured using LEGENDplex Multi-Analyte Flow Assay kit (Biolegend). The restriction of the TCCs was tested with irradiated BLS-DR2a or BLS-DR2b cells upon stimulation with RASGRP2 (78-87) , and proliferation of TCCs was measured at day 3 using 3 H-thymidine (Hartmann Analytic) incorporation assay.
TCC14 cells were co-cultured with BLS-DR2a or BLS-DR2b cells as APCs and stimulated with HLA-DR-SPs, peptides from EBV and Akkermansia , or RASGRP2 (78-87) for 24 h. For each peptide, stimulation was performed with 10 replicate wells, and cells were pooled together after stimulation. After that, TCC14 cells were purified by negative selection using CD19 microbeads, human (Miltenyi) for RNA extraction and sequencing.
Blood B cells and monocytes from HDs and MS patients were purified by magnetic cell separation, TECs in thymic tissues from HLA-DR15 + immunologically healthy children were isolated by sorter, and peptide-stimulated TCC14 cells were purified by magnetic cell separation as described above. Isolated cells were washed twice with PBS, and RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA sequencing was performed using HiSeq 4000 or NovaSeq 6000 System (Illumina, California, USA) at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ). The RNA sequencing raw data have been deposited to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with the accession codes PRJEB34207, PRJEB34209, and PRJEB35576. Heatmaps of the mRNA expression level of the essential proteases in antigen processing were generated using Heatmapper ( Babicki et al., 2016 4. Babicki, S. ∙ Arndt, D. ∙ Marcu, A. ... Heatmapper: web-enabled heat mapping for all Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W147-53 Crossref Scopus (830) PubMed Google Scholar ). Heatmaps of the mRNA expression level in TCC14 cells were generated using R package ezRun (FGCZ).
A L-amino acid decapeptide ps-SCL (N-acetylated and C-amide, TPI 2040) was prepared as described ( Pinilla et al., 1994 66. Pinilla, C. ∙ Appel, J.R. ∙ Houghten, R.A. Investigation of antigen-antibody interactions using a soluble, non-support-bound synthetic decapeptide library composed of four trillion (4 x 10(12) sequences Biochem. J. 1994; 301 :847-853 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ), which include 200 peptide mixtures as shown in Figure S6 A. To test the reactivity with the library, TCC14 was co-cultured with irradiated BLS-DR2b cells as APCs and stimulated with each of the 200 peptide mixtures at a concentration of 200 μg/ml. The proliferation of TCC14 was measured after 72 h using 3 H-thymidine incorporation assay, and a scoring matrix was then generated based on the stimulatory potency of each peptide mixture. Using a biometrical analysis procedure generated before ( Zhao et al., 2001 100. Zhao, Y. ∙ Gran, B. ∙ Pinilla, C. ... Combinatorial peptide libraries and biometric score matrices permit the quantitative analysis of specific and degenerate interactions between clonotypic TCR and MHC peptide ligands J. Immunol. 2001; 167 :2130-2141 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), the scoring matrix was used to score all decapeptides of proteins encoded by EBV, HCMV, Akkermansia , and Prevotella from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database. The distribution of the scores of the decapeptides from EBV, HCMV, Akkermansia , and Prevotella were limited to a range of 20 to 125, with 190.88 being the highest possible score and 14.57 the lowest. ∼30 peptides each from EBV, HCMV, Akkermansia , and Prevotella with high scores between 75 to 125 as shown in Table S7 were chosen to be synthesized (Peptides & Elephants), and the proliferative responses of TCC14 to these peptides determined using 3 H-thymidine (Hartmann Analytic) incorporation assay.
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8.0. Unpaired t test and paired t test were used for statistical analyses between two groups. Correlation was calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation test. The statistical tests used are reported in the figure legends. The value of n reported within figure legends represents number of donors. Data are expressed as mean or mean ± SEM, which are indicated in the figure legends. The data were considered statistically significant when differences achieved values of p < 0.05. The p values are reported in the figures where significant.
