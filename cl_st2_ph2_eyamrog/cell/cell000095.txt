Title: Structural and Functional Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Entry by Using Human ACE2


Abstract: Summary

The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China has caused significant public health concerns. Recently, ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-CTD) spike (S) protein in complex with human ACE2 (hACE2), which reveals a hACE2-binding mode similar overall to that observed for SARS-CoV. However, atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-RBD. Additionally, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) were unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These findings shed light on the viral pathogenesis and provide important structural information regarding development of therapeutic countermeasures against the emerging virus.

Section: Introduction

Emerging and re-emerging viruses are a significant threat to global public health ( Gao, 2018 8. Gao, G.F. From “A”IV to “Z”IKV: Attacks from emerging and re-emerging pathogens Cell. 2018; 172 :1157-1159 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the end of 2019, Chinese authorities have reported a cluster of human pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, China ( Wang et al., 2020 44. Wang, C. ∙ Horby, P.W. ∙ Hayden, F.G. ... A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern Lancet. 2020; 395 :470-473 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5213) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the disease was designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These cases showed symptoms such as fever and dyspnea and were diagnosed as viral pneumonia ( Tan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020 37. Tan, W. ∙ Zhao, X. ∙ Ma, X. ...

Whole-genome sequencing results showed that the causative agent was a novel coronavirus that was initially named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) ( Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020 52.

Later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) officially designated the virus SARS-CoV-2 ( Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020 4. Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2 Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :536-544 Crossref Scopus (5188) PubMed Google Scholar ), although many virologists argue that HCoV-19 is more appropriate ( Jiang et al., 2020 17. Jiang, S. ∙ Shi, Z. ∙ Shu, Y. ... A distinct name is needed for the new coronavirus Lancet. 2020; 395 :949 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). As of February 24, 2020, 79,331 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to the WHO globally, with 77,262 cases in China, including 2,595 deaths ( https://www.who.int/ ). In addition, 29 other countries have confirmed imported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( https://www.who.int/ ), raising great public health concerns worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus that is known to cause human disease. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of large and enveloped viruses with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes ( Lai et al., 2007; Lu and Liu, 2012 20. Lai, M.M.C. ∙ Perlman, S. ∙ Anderson, L.J. Coronaviridae Knipe, D.M. ∙ Howley, P.M. (Editors) Fields Virology Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2007; 1305-1335 Google Scholar 25. Lu, G. ∙ Liu, D. SARS-like virus in the Middle East: a truly bat-related coronavirus causing human diseases Protein Cell. 2012; 3 :803-805 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). The viruses can be classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and deltaCoVs ( Woo et al., 2009 49. Woo, P.C. ∙ Lau, S.K. ∙ Lam, C.S. ... Comparative analysis of complete genome sequences of three avian coronaviruses reveals a novel group 3c coronavirus J. Virol. 2009; 83 :908-917 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ; https://talk.ictvonline.org/ ). Previously identified human CoVs that cause human disease include the alphaCoVs hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) ( Lu et al., 2015; Wevers and van der Hoek, 2009 27. Lu, G. ∙ Wang, Q. ∙ Gao, G.F.

Wevers, B.A. ∙ van der Hoek, L. Recently discovered human coronaviruses Clin. Lab. Med. 2009; 29 :715-724 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both alphaCoVs and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 cause self-limiting common cold-like illnesses ( Chiu et al., 2005; Gorse et al., 2009; Jean et al., 2013; Jevšnik et al., 2012 3.

Coronavirus infections in hospitalized pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract disease BMC Infect. Dis. 2012; 12 :365 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection can result in life-threatening disease and have pandemic potential. During 2002–2003, SARS-CoV initially emerged in China and swiftly spread to other parts of the world, causing more than 8,000 infections and approximately 800 related deaths worldwide ( WHO, 2004 47. WHO Cumulative number of reported probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/en/ Date: 2004 Google Scholar ). In 2012, MERS-CoV was first identified in the Middle East and then spread to other countries ( Ksiazek et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012 19. Ksiazek, T.G. ∙ Erdman, D. ∙ Goldsmith, C.S. ..., SARS Working Group A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome N. Engl. J.

Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367 :1814-1820 Crossref Scopus (4276) PubMed Google Scholar ). As of November 2019, a total of 2,494 MERS cases with 858 related deaths have been recorded in 27 countries globally ( https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/ ). Notably, new cases of MERS-CoV infecting humans are still being reported ( https://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/ ). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic pathogens originating from animals. Detailed investigations indicate that SARS-CoV is transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans ( Azhar et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2013; Guan et al., 2003 2. Azhar, E.I. ∙ El-Kafrawy, S.A. ∙ Farraj, S.A. ... Evidence for camel-to-human transmission of MERS coronavirus N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 370 :2499-2505 Crossref Scopus (680) PubMed Google Scholar 9.

Isolation and characterization of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in southern China Science. 2003; 302 :276-278 Crossref Scopus (1848) PubMed Google Scholar ). The source of SARS-CoV-2, however, is still under investigation but linked to a wet animal market ( Zhu et al., 2020; The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team and Li, 2020 38. The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team ∙ Li, Q.

Virus infections initiate with binding of viral particles to host surface cellular receptors. Receptor recognition is therefore an important determinant of the cell and tissue tropism of a virus. In addition, the gain of function of a virus to bind to the receptor counterparts in other species is also a prerequisite for inter-species transmission ( Lu et al., 2015 27. Lu, G. ∙ Wang, Q. ∙ Gao, G.F. Bat-to-human: spike features determining ‘host jump’ of coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and beyond Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23 :468-478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (435) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, with the exception of HCoV-OC43 and HKU1, both of which have been shown to engage sugars for cell attachment ( Li et al., 2005 23. Li, F. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Farzan, M. ... Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor Science. 2005; 309 :1864-1868 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar ), the other human CoVs recognize proteinaceous peptidases as receptors. HCoV-229E binds to human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) ( Li et al., 2019 24. Li, Z. ∙ Tomlinson, A.C. ∙ Wong, A.H. ... The human coronavirus HCoV-229E S-protein structure and receptor binding eLife. 2019; 8 :e51230 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), and MERS-CoV interacts with human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4 or hCD26) ( Lu et al., 2013; Raj et al., 2013 26. Lu, G. ∙ Hu, Y. ∙ Wang, Q. ... Molecular basis of binding between novel human coronavirus MERS-CoV and its receptor CD26 Nature. 2013; 500 :227-231 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar 32.

Although they belong to different genera, SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 interact with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for virus entry ( Hofmann et al., 2005; Li et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009 14. Hofmann, H. ∙ Pyrc, K. ∙ van der Hoek, L. ... Human coronavirus NL63 employs the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor for cellular entry Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus Nature. 2003; 426 :450-454 Crossref Scopus (4646) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Wu, K. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Peng, G. ... Crystal structure of NL63 respiratory coronavirus receptor-binding domain complexed with its human receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :19970-19974 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the outbreak of COVID-19, Chinese scientists promptly determined that SARS-CoV-2 also utilizes hACE2 for cell entry ( Zhou et al., 2020 58. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.-L. ∙ Wang, X.-G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14912) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In CoVs, the entry process is mediated by the envelope-embedded surface-located spike (S) glycoprotein ( Lu et al., 2015 27. Lu, G. ∙ Wang, Q. ∙ Gao, G.F. Bat-to-human: spike features determining ‘host jump’ of coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and beyond Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23 :468-478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (435) PubMed Google Scholar ). This S protein would, in most cases, be cleaved by host proteases into the S1 and S2 subunits, which are responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion, respectively ( Lai et al., 2007 20. Lai, M.M.C. ∙ Perlman, S. ∙ Anderson, L.J. Coronaviridae Knipe, D.M. ∙ Howley, P.M. (Editors) Fields Virology Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2007; 1305-1335 Google Scholar ). S1 can be further divided into an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), both of which can function as a receptor-binding entity (e.g., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV utilize the S1 CTD to recognize the receptor (also called receptor binding domain [RBD]) ( Li et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2013 23. Li, F. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Farzan, M. ... Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor Science. 2005; 309 :1864-1868 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Lu, G. ∙ Hu, Y. ∙ Wang, Q. ... Molecular basis of binding between novel human coronavirus MERS-CoV and its receptor CD26 Nature. 2013; 500 :227-231 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas mouse hepatitis CoV engages the receptor with its S1 NTD ( Taguchi and Hirai-Yuki, 2012 35. Taguchi, F. ∙ Hirai-Yuki, A. Mouse hepatitis virus receptor as a determinant of the mouse susceptibility to MHV infection Front. Microbiol. 2012; 3 :68 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar )). The region in SARS-CoV-2 S protein that is responsible for hACE2 interaction remains unknown.
In this study, by utilizing immunostaining and flow cytometry assays, we first identify the S1 CTD (SARS-CoV-2-CTD) as the key region in SARS-CoV-2 that interacts with the hACE2 receptor. We subsequently solved a 2.5-Å crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD in complex with hACE2, which reveals a receptor-binding mode similar overall to that observed for the SARS-CoV RBD (SARS-RBD). However, SARS-CoV-2-CTD forms more atomic interactions with hACE2 than SARS-RBD, which correlates with data showing higher affinity for receptor binding. Notably, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as murine polyclonal antisera against SARS-S1/RBD were unable to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the previously developed SARS-RBD-based vaccine candidates are unlikely to be of any clinical benefit for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis. Taken together, these data shed light on viral entry and pathogenesis and will hopefully inspire new targeted treatments for this emerging pathogen.

Section: Results

Through bioinformatics analysis, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been shown to display characteristic CoV S features, including a S1 region containing the NTD and CTD, S2, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain ( Figure S1 A). Phylogenetic studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a group containing SARS-CoV as well as two bat-derived SARS-like viruses, ZC45 and ZCX21 ( Figures S1 B–S1D). Recently, hACE2 was reported to be the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 ( Zhou et al., 2020 58. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.-L. ∙ Wang, X.-G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14912) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because SARS-CoV utilizes its S1 CTD, otherwise known as the RBD, to recognize the same receptor, we decided to test whether the CTD in SARS-CoV-2 is also the key region for interaction with its receptor hACE2.
We prepared a series of mouse Fc (mFc)-fused SARS-CoV-2 S protein preparations, including S1 (SARS-CoV-2-S1), the NTD (SARS-CoV-2-NTD), and the CTD, and subsequently visualized their binding to GFP-tagged hACE2 expressed on the cell surface via confocal fluorescence microscopy. As a control, we also prepared the Fc fusion proteins for SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD and tested these in parallel with the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As expected, SARS-RBD showed co-localization with hACE2 and MERS-RBD with hCD26. For the novel CoV proteins, SARS-CoV-2-S1 and SARS-CoV-2-CTD co-localized with hACE2 on the cell surface. The SARS-CoV-2-NTD protein, however, was incapable of binding to hACE2. In addition, none of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins interacted with hCD26 ( Figure 1 ).
We further tested binding of the viral proteins to cell-surface hACE2 via flow cytometry. Consistently, SARS-CoV-2-S1 and SARS-CoV-2-CTD, but not SARS-CoV-2-NTD, showed strong affinity for hACE2 ( Figure S2 A). None of the novel CoV proteins interacted with hCD26 or hAPN ( Figures S2 B and S2C). In addition, soluble hACE2, but not hCD26 or hAPN, was shown to inhibit the interaction between viral proteins, with cells expressing hACE2 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures S2 D–S2I). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of binding, via the viral CTD, to hACE2.
We then attempted to study the structural basis of the virus-receptor interaction. We prepared the SARS-CoV-2-CTD/hACE2 complex by in vitro mixture of the two proteins and isolated complexes via size exclusion chromatography. The complex structure was solved to 2.5-Å resolution ( Table 1 ), with one SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding to a single hACE2 molecule in the asymmetric unit. For hACE2, clear electron densities could be traced for 596 residues from S19 to A614 of the N-terminal peptidase domain as well as glycans N-linked to residues 53, 90, and 322 ( Figure 2 A).
In the complex structure, the SARS-CoV-2-CTD contains 195 consecutive density-traceable residues spanning T333 to P527 together with N-linked glycosylation at N343. Similar to other reported betaCoV CTD structures, this protein also exhibits two structural domains ( Han et al., 2017 12. Han, X. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Song, H. ... Structure of the S1 subunit C-terminal domain from bat-derived coronavirus HKU5 spike protein Virology. 2017; 507 :101-109 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). One is the conserved core subdomain with five antiparallel β strands and a conserved disulfide bond between βc2 and βc4 ( Figures 2 B and S1 D). The other is the external subdomain, which is dominated by a disulfide bond-stabilized flexible loop that connects two small β strands. The complex structure data show that SARS-CoV-2-CTD utilizes its external subdomain to recognize subdomain I in the hACE2 NTD ( Figure 2 A; Towler et al., 2004 39. Towler, P. ∙ Staker, B. ∙ Prasad, S.G. ... ACE2 X-ray structures reveal a large hinge-bending motion important for inhibitor binding and catalysis J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :17996-18007 Crossref Scopus (549) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Further analysis was performed to identify key residues involved in complex formation. Amino acids located within the van der Waals (vdw) contact distance (4.5-Å-resolution cutoff) between the viral ligand and receptor were selected ( Table 2 ), and a series of hydrophilic residues located along the interface were found to form a solid network of H-bond and salt bridge interactions ( Figure 2 ). These strong polar contacts include the SARS-CoV-2-CTD residue A475 interacting with hACE2 residue S19, N487 with Q24 ( Figures 2 C and S3 A), E484 with K31, and Y453 with H34 ( Figures 2 D and S3 B). Residue K417, located in helix α3 of the CTD core subdomain, was shown to contribute ionic interactions with hACE2 D30 ( Figures 2 D and S3 B). Notably, the bulged loops in SARS-CoV-2-CTD, the α1’/β1’ loop and β2′/η1’ loop, properly position several residues (G446, Y449, G496, Q498, T500, and G502) in close proximity with hACE2 amino acids D38, Y41, Q42, K353, and D355, forming a concentration of H-bonds ( Figures 2 E and S3 C). Further virus-receptor contacts include SARS-CoV-2-CTD Y489 and F486 packing against hACE2 residues F28, L79, M82, and Y83, forming a small patch of hydrophobic interactions at the interface ( Figures 2 C and S3 A). Overall, the virus-receptor engagement is dominated by polar contacts mediated by the hydrophilic residues. In support of this hypothesis, a single K353A mutation was sufficient to abolish these interactions ( Figure S2 L).
SARS-CoV-2-CTD exhibits significant structural homology to its SARS-CoV homolog, in agreement with high sequence identity between the two molecules (~73.9%) ( Figure S1 C). Superimposition of the SARS-CoV-2-CTD structure onto a previously reported SARS-RBD structure (PDB: 2GHV ) revealed a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.475 Å for 128 equivalent Cα atoms ( Figure 3 A). In comparison with the SARS-RBD, the majority of the secondary structure elements are well superimposed in SARS-CoV-2-CTD, with the exception of the β1′/β2′ loop, which showed the most sequence variation between the two ligands ( Figures 3 A and S1 D).
The overall structure of the SARS-CoV-2-CTD/hACE2 complex is very similar to the previously reported structure of SARS-RBD bound to the same receptor with an RMSD of 0.431 Å for 669 equivalent Cα atoms ( Li et al., 2005 23. Li, F. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Farzan, M. ... Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor Science. 2005; 309 :1864-1868 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 A–3C). Consistent with this high degree of similarity, the soluble SARS-RBD blocks the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 ligand with hACE2 in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figures S2 J and S2K). Further detailed comparison of the receptor binding interface between the two viruses reveals that, among the 24 residues in hACE2 that make vdw contacts with either CTD, 15 amino acids display more contacts with the SARS-CoV-2-CTD ( Table 2 ). The SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding interface also has more residues than SARS-RBD (21 versus 17) that directly interact with hACE2, forming more vdw contacts (288 versus 213) as well as H-bonds (16 versus 11) ( Tables 2 and S1 ). Consistently, SARS-CoV-2-CTD in complex with hACE2 buries larger surface areas than SARS-RBD (1773 Å 2 versus 1686 Å 2 ).
Notably, the most variable loop (β1’/β2′ loop) contributes substantially more vdw contacts in SARS-CoV-2-CTD than for the SARS-RBD (115 versus 53) ( Figure 3 D; Table S1 ). Specifically, F486 in SARS-CoV-2, instead of I472 in SARS-RBD, forms strong aromatic-aromatic interactions with hACE2 Y83, and E484 in the SARS-CoV-2-CTD, instead of P470 in the SARS-RBD, forms ionic interactions with K31 ( Figure 3 D).
In light of the increased atomic interactions between hACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2-CTD compared with the SARS-RBD, we speculated that the former should bind to the receptor with stronger affinity than the latter. To test this hypothesis, we performed real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. The mFc-tagged S-domain proteins were captured by anti-mouse IgG (mIgG) antibodies that were immobilized on the chip and tested for binding with gradient concentrations of the soluble ectodomain proteins of hACE2 and hCD26. As assay controls, SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD were found to readily interact with their respective canonical receptors ( Figures 4 A and 4D). SARS-CoV-2-S1 and SARS-CoV-2-CTD bound to hACE2 but not to hCD26 ( Figures 4 E, 4F, 4I, and 4J). The recorded binding profiles revealed typical slow-on/slow-off kinetics, as observed with the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. The equilibrium dissociation constants (K D ) of SARS-CoV-2-S1 and SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding to hACE2 were calculated to be 94.6 ± 6.5 nM and 133.3 ± 5.6 nM, respectively. These values represent ~4-fold higher binding affinities than that observed for the SARS-RBD engaging the same receptor, which was determined to be 408.7 ± 11.1 nM ( Figure 4 ). Taken together, the increased atomic interactions between the hACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding region leads to ~4-fold higher binding affinity compared with the SARS-RBD.
To conclude, we set out to investigate the epitope features of SARS-CoV-2 S by using a panel of murine mAbs directed against SARS-CoV S, including the B30A38, A50A1A1, and C31A12 antibodies, which recognize SARS-CoV S1, and mAbs 1–3, which recognize the SARS-RBD ( Figure S1 D; Wen et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2009 45.

Antibody binding site mapping of SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain by a combination of yeast surface display and phage peptide library screening Viral Immunol. 2009; 22 :407-415 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using flow cytometry, all six mAbs were observed to effectively bind to cells expressing SARS-CoV S. None of the mAbs, however, interacted with SARS-CoV-2 S ( Figures 5 A and 5B).
In comparison with a limited number of mAbs, polyclonal antibodies provide a more comprehensive view on potential epitope differences. In light of the determinant role of SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD in receptor recognition ( Li et al., 2003, 2005; Lu et al., 2013; Raj et al., 2013 22. Li, W. ∙ Moore, M.J. ∙ Vasilieva, N. ...

Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC Nature. 2013; 495 :251-254 Crossref Scopus (1608) PubMed Google Scholar ), the majority of neutralizing antibodies have been shown to target the RBD, exerting neutralization activity by disrupting virus/receptor engagement ( Du et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2016 5. Du, L. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... The spike protein of SARS-CoV--a target for vaccine and therapeutic development Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7 :226-236 Crossref Scopus (1276) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Wang, Q. ∙ Wong, G. ∙ Lu, G. ... MERS-CoV spike protein: Targets for vaccines and therapeutics Antiviral Res. 2016; 133 :165-177 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore further prepared murine polyclonal antibodies against SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD. These two viral RBDs share very limited sequence identity and exhibit distinct structural characteristics in the RBD external subdomain that mediates receptor binding ( Li et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2013 23. Li, F. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Farzan, M. ... Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor Science. 2005; 309 :1864-1868 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Lu, G. ∙ Hu, Y. ∙ Wang, Q. ... Molecular basis of binding between novel human coronavirus MERS-CoV and its receptor CD26 Nature. 2013; 500 :227-231 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the positive control, anti-SARS-RBD antibodies, but not anti-MERS-RBD antibodies, potently bound to cells expressing SARS-CoV S, as expected ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Nonetheless, neither of the antibody preparations bound to SARS-CoV-2 S ( Figures 5 E and 5F). In agreement with this observation, although SARS-CoV-2-CTD is structurally similar to the SARS-RBD structures ( Figure 3 ), the electrostatic surface potential maps of these proteins were different ( Figure 5 G and 5H), which might explain the differing immunogenicity of the two ligands. Therefore, the results highlight distinct epitope features between SARS-RBD and SARS-CoV-2-CTD, although both can engage hACE2.

Section: Discussion

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in China has led to major public health concerns. ACE2 has been reported to be the receptor for this novel CoV ( Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020 13. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor Cell. 2020; S0092-8674(20)30229-4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13999) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.-L. ∙ Wang, X.-G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14912) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we determined the key region in SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the interaction with the receptor and solved the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD in complex with hACE2.
Considering the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, a total of seven human CoVs have been reported so far. Of these viruses, three (hCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have been shown to utilize the hACE2 receptor for cell entry. The complex structures of hCoV-NL63 CTD and SARS-RBD bound to hACE2 have been reported previously ( Li et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2009 23. Li, F. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Farzan, M. ... Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor Science. 2005; 309 :1864-1868 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Wu, K. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Peng, G. ... Crystal structure of NL63 respiratory coronavirus receptor-binding domain complexed with its human receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :19970-19974 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although hCoV-NL63 CTD and SARS-RBD are structurally distinct, the two viral ligands recognize and engage sterically overlapping sites in the receptor ( Li, 2015 21. Li, F. Receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses: a decade of structural studies J. Virol. 2015; 89 :1954-1964 Crossref Scopus (420) PubMed Google Scholar ). The complex structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD together with hACE2 reveals that the majority of binding sites of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 also overlap the SARS-CoV binding site. The observations favor a scenario where these CoVs have evolved to recognize a “hotspot” region in hACE2 for receptor binding.
During the revision of our manuscript, the full-length hACE2 structure was reported to form a dimer in the presence of B 0 AT1 (an amino acid transporter), as revealed by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Structural basis for the recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; Published online March 4, 2020 Crossref Scopus (3652) Google Scholar ). They also reported the cryo-EM structure of dimeric hACE2-B 0 AT1 bound to two SARS-CoV-2-CTDs, with each molecule bound to an hACE2 monomer, with a local resolution of 3.5 Å at the interface. Our crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD/hACE2 is well superimposed with the cryo-EM structure, with an RMSD of 1.019 Å over 722 pairs of Cα atoms. Notably, two cryo-EM structures of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were also published recently, with the receptor binding region buried or exposed ( Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020 40. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein Cell. 2020; S0092-8674(20)30262-2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6115) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is consistent with the structural features of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S proteins ( Yuan et al., 2017 54. Yuan, Y. ∙ Cao, D. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Cryo-EM structures of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins reveal the dynamic receptor binding domains Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15092 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further structure alignments show that the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD in the complex also fits well with its counterparts in the cryo-EM structures, with RMSDs of 0.724 Å (exposed state) and 0.742 Å (buried states) related to PDB: 6VSB and 0.632 Å (exposed state) and 0.622 Å (buried state) related to PDB: 6VYB , respectively. These results indicate that the crystal structure of the complex is consistent with the respective cryo-EM structures and provide more detailed binding information.
Considering the high sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2-CTD and SARS-RBD, atomic comparisons of the two viral ligands binding the same receptor were performed. Atomic details reveal more interactions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD/hACE2 than in SARS-RBD/hACE2, including more engaged residues, more vdw contacts, more H-bonds, as well as larger buried surface areas. Interestingly, the β1’/β2′ loop, which is the most variable region between SARS-CoV-2-CTD and SARS-RBD, confers more interactions to SARS-CoV-2-CTD/hACE2, including strong interactions, such as aromatic-aromatic interactions and ionic interactions, in contrast to the SARS-RBD β1’/β2′ loop. A recently published paper also indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds hACE2 with higher affinity than the SARS-CoV S protein ( Wrapp et al., 2020 50. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was shown in this report as well.
Proteolysis of the S protein into S1 and S2 is another prerequisite for CoVs infection. MERS-Uganda and the bat CoV HKU4 can readily interact with hCD26, but they both require protease activation for cell entry ( Kam et al., 2009; Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2009; Menachery et al., 2015, 2020; Wang et al., 2014 18.

Bat origins of MERS-CoV supported by bat coronavirus HKU4 usage of human receptor CD26 Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16 :328-337 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent study shows that, in contrast with SARS-CoV S, which does not contain furin recognition sites between S1 and S2, SARS-CoV-2 S contains one potential cleavage site and could be efficiently processed into S1 and S2 ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 13. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor Cell. 2020; S0092-8674(20)30229-4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13999) PubMed Google Scholar ). The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been reported to contribute to priming of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and a TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use was able to block entry. The authors postulated that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might be a treatment option ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 13. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor Cell. 2020; S0092-8674(20)30229-4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13999) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share more than 70% sequence identity in the S protein, and both engage hACE2 via the CTD, we find that the two viruses CTDs are antigenically distinct. When using a panel of mAbs targeting SARS-CoV S1/CTD, none of the antibodies were able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 S. mAb1 and mAb2/mAb3 used in the above assay have been determined to bind to SARS-CoV S protein 330–350 and 380–399, respectively ( Zhang et al., 2009 56. Zhang, X. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Wen, K. ... Antibody binding site mapping of SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain by a combination of yeast surface display and phage peptide library screening Viral Immunol. 2009; 22 :407-415 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the binding sites for the other three mAbs (B30A38, A50A1A1, and C31A12), which were generated using SARS-CoV S1 as the immunogen, remain elusive. Consistently, a recently published paper also reported similar results showing that three SARS-RBD-directed mAbs, S230, m396, and 80R, were unable to bind to SARS-CoV-2 ( Wrapp et al., 2020 50. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, we also demonstrate that polyclonal antisera directed against SARS-RBD do not recognize the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. A comparison of the two viral ligands shows that they display divergent electrostatic potential, which likely results in differing immunogenicity despite both ligands showing a similar protein fold.
Considering the key role of the CTD in receptor binding, this receptor engagement entity is an ideal immunogen for vaccine development. For instance, SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD proteins have been shown to efficiently induce production of neutralizing antibodies ( Du et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2016 5. Du, L. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... The spike protein of SARS-CoV--a target for vaccine and therapeutic development Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7 :226-236 Crossref Scopus (1276) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Wang, Q. ∙ Wong, G. ∙ Lu, G. ... MERS-CoV spike protein: Targets for vaccines and therapeutics Antiviral Res. 2016; 133 :165-177 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, because of the observed differences in antigenicity and electrostatic distribution between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is unclear whether previously developed SARS-RBD-based vaccine candidates, such as subunit vaccines, will confer effective SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis. During the revision of our manuscript, other studies have reported that SARS-CoV S-elicited polyclonal antibodies in mice and patients potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into cells ( Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020 13. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor Cell. 2020; S0092-8674(20)30229-4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13999) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein Cell. 2020; S0092-8674(20)30262-2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the S2 regions between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit higher sequence identity (~90%) and also contain neutralizing epitopes ( Duan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2015 6. Duan, J. ∙ Yan, X. ∙ Guo, X. ... A human SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody against epitope on S2 protein Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333 :186-193 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Wang, L. ∙ Shi, W. ∙ Joyce, M.G. ... Evaluation of candidate vaccine approaches for MERS-CoV Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7712 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the efficacy of SARS-CoV vaccines targeting S proteins for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis requires further evaluation and study.
In conclusion, CoVs are zoonotic pathogens and infect humans via inter-species transmission. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are two notorious examples of CoVs crossing the species barrier and resulting in human infection. Previous studies have shown that the two viruses first jumped from their natural hosts (bats) to an intermediate adaptive animal (e.g., dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) before infecting humans ( Azhar et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014 2. Azhar, E.I. ∙ El-Kafrawy, S.A. ∙ Farraj, S.A. ... Evidence for camel-to-human transmission of MERS coronavirus N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 370 :2499-2505 Crossref Scopus (680) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Wang, Q. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Yuan, Y. ... Bat origins of MERS-CoV supported by bat coronavirus HKU4 usage of human receptor CD26 Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16 :328-337 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Delineating this cross-species transmission route could be highly instructive for disease control. Nevertheless, the natural host and the intermediate adaptive animal, if any, for SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. The structural information for SARS-CoV-2-CTD and hACE2 shown in this study should shed light on the viral inter-species transmission route by characterizing the interactions between S and hACE2 of different species in the future.

The number of replicates carried out for each experiment is described in the figure/table legends.
HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) and Huh7 cells (Institute of Basic Medical Sciences CAMS 3111C0001CCC000679) were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
The plasmids used for protein expression and purification were separately constructed by insertion of the coding sequences of hCD26 (residues 39−766, accession number NP_001926 ), hACE2 (residues 19−615, accession number: BAJ21180 ) and hAPN (residues 66−967, accession number: NP_001141 ) into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastbac1 (Invitrogen) using the Eco RI and Xho I restriction sites. All proteins contained an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and a C-terminal 6 × His tag.
The pEGFP-C1-hCD26 and pEGFP-C1-hAPN plasmids were constructed by cloning the coding region of hCD26 or hAPN into pEGFP-C1 using restriction enzymes Xho I and Sma I, respectively. Similarly, the hACE2 protein was fused to eGFP by cloning the coding region into pEGFP-N1.
Recombinant proteins SARS-CoV-2-S1-mFc, SARS-CoV-2-NTD-mFc, SARS-CoV-2-CTD-mFc, MERS-RBD-mFc and SARS-RBD-mFc were used in assays of flow cytometry (FACS), immunostaining and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2-S1 (residues 1-685, GISAID: EPI_ISL_402119), SARS-CoV-2-NTD (residues 1−286, GISAID: EPI_ISL_402119), SARS-CoV-2-CTD (residues 319−541, GISAID: EPI_ISL_402119), MERS-RBD (residues 367-606, GenBank: JX869050 ) and SARS-RBD (residues 306-527, GenBank: NC_004718 ) tagged with the mFc domain of mouse IgG were individually cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector using the Eco RI and Xho I restriction sites. For the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-CTD, SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD, signal peptides from the parental virus were used.
The full-length coding region of SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S protein with a C-terminal Flag tag was cloned into the pCAGGS vector using the Eco RI and Sma I restriction sites (pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2 S-Flag, pCAGGS-SARS S-Flag and pCAGGS-MERS S-Flag).
The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used to express the proteins for FACS and SPR analysis. The constructed pFastbac1 vectors were transformed into DH10Bac competent cells to generate recombinant bacmids ( Zhang et al., 2010 57. Zhang, W. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Shi, Y. ...

Transfection of bacmids and virus amplification were conducted in Sf9 cells, while Hi5 cells were used for protein expression. The supernatants of Hi5 cells were collected 48 h post-infection, and soluble proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography using a HisTrap HP 5 mL column (GE Healthcare). The samples were then pooled and further purified via size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl.
The mFc recombinant proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells. pCAGGS plasmid containing MERS-RBD coding sequences were transiently transfected into cells. After 4 d expression, supernatants were collected, centrifuged, and mixed with the same volume of binding buffer containing 20 mM Na 3 PO 4 (pH 7.0). The mixtures were then filtered through 0.22-μm filters and passed through a HiTrap rProtein A FF (GE Healthcare) affinity chromatography column at a maximum flow rate of 1 mL/min. The bound protein was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 3.0) and collected into tubes containing 200 μL 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). mFc fusion proteins were further purified by gel filtration in PBS and concentrated and stored at −80°C. To prepare the mouse Fc-fusion proteins of SARS-CoV-2-S1, SARS-CoV-2-NTD, SARS-CoV-2-CTD and, SARS-RBD, HEK293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS plasmid containing the coding sequence for the indicated protein. 24 h later, the supernatant containing the indicated protein were collected, concentrated and then used for FACS, immunostaining and SPR assays.
For the binding test, plasmids containing hCD26, hACE2 or hAPN that were fused with eGFP were transfected into HEK293T cells using PEI (Alfa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2 × 10 5 cells were collected 24 h after transfection, suspended in PBS (with 0.5% FBS) and incubated with the individual mFc-fusion proteins-containing supernatant at 37°C for 30 min, followed by washing with PBS twice and further incubation with anti-mIgG/APC antibodies (1:500, Miltenyi Biotec). After washing, the cells were analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur. The cells incubated with only the secondary antibody were used as negative controls. For the binding-blocking assay, the supernatant containing the indicated mFc-fusion proteins were preincubated with hACE2, hCD26 or hAPN at concentration of 100, 10, 1, or 0.1 μg/mL at 37°C for 1 h before the addition to the cells.
When SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD were used for binding competition assay, 2 × 10 5 HEK293T cells with transient expression of hACE2 were incubated with SARS-RBD or MERS-RBD at concentrations of 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 μg/mL at 37°C for 1 h. The supernatant containing the indicated proteins were subsequently added. After washing with PBS (with 0.5% FBS), anti-mIgG/APC (1:500, Miltenyi Biotec) antibodies were used to detect the binding.
To test whether anti-SARS-CoV S antibodies bound to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, HEK293T cells were first transfected with pCAGGS containing Flag-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S protein. HEK293T cells expressing SARS-CoV S protein were used as positive control. The purified murine Abs were then used at final concentration of 10 μg/mL to stain 3 × 10 5 cells. After washing with PBS with 0.5% FBS, anti-mIgG/APC (1:500, Miltenyi Biotec) was added. After washing, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with Fixation/Permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences), and stained with anti-Flag/FITC (1:100, Miltenyi Biotec) at 37°C for 30 min. After washing, the cells were subjected to BD FACSCanto for fluorescent detection. The data was subsequently analyzed using FlowJo V10.
Previously immunized murine polyclonal antibodies were also applied to test binding to SARS-CoV-2. 2 × 10 5 HEK293T cells expressing Flag-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were incubated with murine MERS-RBD-immunized sera (1:10 dilution) or SARS-RBD-immunized sera (1:10 dilution) at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were sequentially washed twice, incubated with anti-mIgG/APC (1:500, Miltenyi Biotec), washed again, and fixed and permeabilized with Fixation/Permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences). Then anti-Flag/FITC (1:100 dilution, Miltenyi Biotec) was added to the cells and stained for another 30 min, before washing and fluorescence analysis by BD FACSCanto.
The interaction between indicated mFc-fusion protein with hACE2 or hCD26 was monitored by SPR using a BIAcore 8K (GE Healthcare) carried out at 25°C in single-cycle mode. The CM5 biosensor chip (GE Healthcare) was first immobilized with anti-mIgG antibody for flow cells (Fc) 1 and 2, according to manufacturer’s amine-coupling chemistry protocol (GE Healthcare). The indicated mFc-tagged protein was then injected and captured on Fc 2. Fc 1 was used as the negative control. Both hACE2 and hCD26 used for this assay were in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20. Concentrated supernatant containing SARS-CoV-2-S1-mFc, SARS-CoV-2-NTD-mFc, SARS-CoV-2-CTD-mFc and SARS-RBD-mFc and purified MERS-RBD-mFc were individually captured by the antibody immobilized on the CM5 chip at approximately 200-500 response units. Various concentrations of hCD26s and hACE2s were then flowed through the chip and the real-time response was recorded. The concentrations of hCD26 were 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 nM when testing interactions with MERS-RBD. To test the interaction with SARS-CoV-2-S1-mFc, SARS-CoV-2-NTD-mFc, SARS-CoV-2-CTD-mFc and SARS-RBD-mFc, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 nM of hCD26 were used. The concentrations of hACE2 were 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 nM. After each reaction, the chip was re-generated using pH 1.7 glycine. The equilibrium dissociation constants (binding affinity, K D ) for each pair of interaction were calculated using BIAcore® 8K evaluation software (GE Healthcare). The K D values were calculated using the model of 1:1 (Langmuir) binding mode. The graphics were prepared using SigmaPlot 10.0.
For indirect immunofluorescence analysis, HEK293T cells were pre-seeded in a 15 mm culture dish and transfected with plasmids containing either eGFP-tagged hACE2 or hCD26. 24 h later, the cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and then blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with concentrated supernatant containing indicated proteins or purified MERS-RBD-mFc proteins (10 μg/mL). Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with goat anti-mIgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200, ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (5 μg/mL, Beyotime). The cells were then visualized on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.
Both MERS-RBD and SARS-RBD were expressed and purified as previously reported ( Li et al., 2005; Raj et al., 2013 23. Li, F. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Farzan, M. ... Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor Science. 2005; 309 :1864-1868 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Raj, V.S. ∙ Mou, H. ∙ Smits, S.L. ... Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC Nature. 2013; 495 :251-254 Crossref Scopus (1608) PubMed Google Scholar ). Five BALB/c mice were immunized intra-muscularly with 10 μg MERS-RBD or SARS-RBD resuspended in PBS solution (pH 7.4) in the presence of MF59. Three weeks later, mice were boosted. The antisera were collected 2 weeks after the boost and kept at −20°C before use. The antisera mixture from five mice were used to evaluate the binding of S protein in flow cytometry assay.
Crystallization trials were performed by sitting-drop method with 0.8 μL protein mixing with 0.8 μL reservoir solution at 18°C. The initial crystallization screenings were carried out using the commercially available kits. Diffractable crystals of the SARS-CoV-2-CTD/hACE2 complex was finally obtained in a solution consisting of 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 10% w/v PEG 5000 MME and 12% v/v 1-propanol with a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml.
Diffraction data was collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) BL17U (wavelength, 0.97919 Å). For data collection, the crystals were cryo-protected by briefly soaking in reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. The dataset was processed with HKL2000 software ( Otwinowski and Minor, 1997 31. Otwinowski, Z. ∙ Minor, W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 :307-326 Crossref Scopus (39107) PubMed Google Scholar ). The complex structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD with hACE2 was determined by the molecular replacement method using Phaser ( Read, 2001 33. Read, R.J. Pushing the boundaries of molecular replacement with maximum likelihood Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57 :1373-1382 Crossref Scopus (805) PubMed Google Scholar ) with previously reported SARS-RBD complex structure (PDB: 2AJF ). The atomic models were completed with Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 7. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refined with phenix.refine in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the stereochemical qualities of the final models were assessed with MolProbity ( Williams et al., 2018 48. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: More and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2301) PubMed Google Scholar ).
