Title: Maturation and persistence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 memory B cell response


Abstract: Summary

Memory B cells play a fundamental role in host defenses against viruses, but to date, their role has been relatively unsettled in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We report here a longitudinal single-cell and repertoire profiling of the B cell response up to 6 months in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Distinct SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific activated B cell clones fueled an early antibody-secreting cell burst as well as a durable synchronous germinal center response. While highly mutated memory B cells, including pre-existing cross-reactive seasonal Betacoronavirus-specific clones, were recruited early in the response, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones accumulated with time and largely contributed to the late, remarkably stable, memory B cell pool. Highlighting germinal center maturation, these cells displayed clear accumulation of somatic mutations in their variable region genes over time. Overall, these findings demonstrate that an antigen-driven activation persisted and matured up to 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and may provide long-term protection.

Section: Introduction

The new emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected 88 million people and killed over 1.9 million individuals worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the establishment of protective immune memory in recovering individuals is a major concern for public health and for anticipating vaccination outcomes.
In response to viral infection, virus-specific T and B cells are activated, expand, and differentiate into effector cells ( Wherry and Ahmed, 2004 66. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Ahmed, R. Memory CD8 T-cell differentiation during viral infection J. Virol. 2004; 78 :5535-5545 Crossref Scopus (722) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the early phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most infected individuals generate antibodies targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) and the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, including S receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies with strong neutralizing potential ( Wajnberg et al., 2020 62.

COVID-19 patients also develop potent early CD8 + and CD4 + T cell-specific responses ( Braun et al., 2020 3. Braun, J. ∙ Loyal, L. ∙ Frentsch, M. ...

Studies have documented that B cells from patients with severe COVID-19 harbored low mutations frequencies in their heavy-chain variable region (V H ) genes, notably those producing anti-RBD antibodies ( Nielsen et al., 2020 40. Nielsen, S.C.A. ∙ Yang, F. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ... Human B Cell Clonal Expansion and Convergent Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28 :516-525.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggested an active early extrafollicular response in which naive unmutated B cells first engage in cognate interactions with T cells and become fully activated to divide and differentiate into plasma cells (PCs) ( Jenks et al., 2019 20. Jenks, S.A. ∙ Cashman, K.S. ∙ Woodruff, M.C. ... Extrafollicular responses in humans and SLE Immunol. Rev. 2019; 288 :136-148 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Along with limited somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection, cells derived from extrafollicular responses are usually considered as short lived ( MacLennan et al., 2003 31. MacLennan, I.C.M. ∙ Toellner, K.-M. ∙ Cunningham, A.F. ... Extrafollicular antibody responses Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194 :8-18 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Long-term humoral immunity following infection relies on two types of cells derived from germinal center (GC) responses: long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), which continuously secrete antibodies ( Slifka et al., 1998 55. Slifka, M.K. ∙ Antia, R. ∙ Whitmire, J.K. ... Humoral immunity due to long-lived plasma cells Immunity. 1998; 8 :363-372 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (994) PubMed Google Scholar ), and memory B cells (MBCs), which can expand and differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) upon a new antigenic challenge ( Yoshida et al., 2010 69. Yoshida, T. ∙ Mei, H. ∙ Dörner, T. ... Memory B and memory plasma cells Immunol. Rev. 2010; 237 :117-139 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). MBCs can also adapt to cope with antigenic changes linked to virus mutations, as exemplified by the coevolution of neutralizing antibodies against mutating epitopes during HIV infection ( Escolano et al., 2016 11. Escolano, A. ∙ Steichen, J.M. ∙ Dosenovic, P. ...

Assessing whether an MBC response, with the ability to rapidly produce SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies upon a new infectious challenge months or years after initial infection, is established in convalescent COVID-19 patients, thus of immediate relevance for ongoing modeling of herd immunity and the formulation of vaccine strategies.

Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.-H. ∙ Boucau, J. ..., Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness Specimen Working Group Loss of Bcl-6-Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and Germinal Centers in COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 183 :143-157.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was also suggested that the strong extrafollicular B cell activation observed after symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection could prevent or delay a GC-dependent immune response ( Woodruff et al., 2020 67. Woodruff, M.C. ∙ Ramonell, R.P. ∙ Nguyen, D.C. ... Extrafollicular B cell responses correlate with neutralizing antibodies and morbidity in COVID-19 Nat.

In this context, analysis of the longevity and functionality of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 MBC response becomes a major issue, notably to evaluate the protection afforded by a prior infection to subsequent viral challenges.
In the present study, we present a longitudinal deep profiling of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 MBC response in two parallel cohorts of patients with severe (S-CoV) and mild (M-CoV) COVID-19. We combined single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell culture, and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) genes sequencing to track and characterize the cellular and molecular phenotype and clonal evolution of S-specific MBC clones from early time points after SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 6 months after the initial symptoms. Our results provide new insights on the origin, magnitude, and stability of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 MBC response and revealed in most patients the robust acquisition of a GC-derived immune memory.

Section: Results

To characterize the longitudinal evolution of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, we set up a prospective cohort of patients with S-CoV requiring oxygen (n = 21, median age: 57 years [40-78], corresponding to WHO progression scale >4 and ≤8) and mild ambulatory forms of COVID-19 (M-CoV, n = 18, median age 35.5 years [28–64], corresponding to WHO progression scale <4; Marshall et al., 2020 33. Marshall, J.C. ∙ Murthy, S. ∙ Diaz, J. ..., WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characterisation and Management of COVID-19 infection A minimal common outcome measure set for COVID-19 clinical research Lancet Infect. Dis. 2020; 20 :e192-e197 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1063) PubMed Google Scholar ) (MEMO-COV, NCT04402892, see STAR methods and Table S1 ). Initial samples were collected from patients in median 18.8 days (±SD: 8.8) and 35.5 days (±SD: 12.8) after disease onset (M0) for S-CoV and M-CoV respectively. Two additional blood samples were collected at 3 (M3) and 6 months (M6) at a stage when all patients had fully recovered. All sera were first examined for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the immunodominant N and S proteins using commercial ELISA. As previously observed in other studies ( Ripperger et al., 2020 45. Ripperger, T.J. ∙ Uhrlaub, J.L. ∙ Watanabe, M. ... Orthogonal SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays Enable Surveillance of Low-Prevalence Communities and Reveal Durable Humoral Immunity Immunity. 2020; 53 :925-933.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), N-specific IgG antibodies showed a rapid decrease in both cohorts ( Figure 1 A). This decrease was particularly pronounced in M-CoV patients, among which 9 out of 18 had titers below the threshold of positivity at 6 months ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ). In contrast, S-specific IgG antibodies appeared quite stable with time and only two M-CoV patients showed anti-S antibody titers below detection threshold at the time of our last sampling ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Levels of S-specific IgG antibodies at 3 and 6 months, however, were significantly higher in patients who had developed a more severe form of the disease ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Elevated titers of anti-S IgG strongly correlated with enhanced neutralization potential of patients’ sera in vitro ( Figure 1 D; Figures S1 A and S1B), confirming the S trimetric glycoprotein as a primary target of the protective immune response in patients.
To further track the SARS-CoV-2-specific MBC response, we next implemented two complementary in-depth approaches on four S-CoV patients’ samples. First, we generated His-tagged trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain and used successive staining with His-tagged S protein and two fluorescently labeled anti-His antibodies to stain and perform high purity single-cell sorting of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B cells ( Figure 1 E). Single B cells were further cultured in an optimized in vitro culture assay ( McCarthy et al., 2018 35. McCarthy, K.R. ∙ Watanabe, A. ∙ Kuraoka, M. ... Memory B Cells that Cross-React with Group 1 and Group 2 Influenza A Viruses Are Abundant in Adult Human Repertoires Immunity. 2018; 48 :174-184.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 F). After 21 days of culture, RNA was extracted from single-cell cultures to determine their IgH VDJ sequence. Culture supernatants with IgG concentration over 1 μg/mL were additionally tested by ELISA to validate the cell specificity toward SARS-CoV-2 S protein (over 95% purity in this assay; Figure S1 C), investigate its recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD and its neutralization potential, and analyze potential cross-reactivity to S proteins from seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1/HCoV-OC43). In parallel, to get a broader view of the overall B cell response toward SARS-CoV-2 at both early (M0) and late time points (M6), we sorted CD19 + IgD − B cells from the same patients ( Figures S1 D–S1H) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the 10X Genomics technology. This allowed us to couple both 5′ scRNA-seq, V(D)J profiling, and feature barcoding of 20 known B cell surface markers, and we also developed anti-His barcoded antibodies to reveal His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B cells.
Unsupervised clustering analysis of our scRNA-seq dataset revealed that CD19 + IgD − B cells could be divided in five major clusters according to their gene expression profile ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Figures S2 A and S2B; Table S2 ), a clustering which correlated nicely with the expression of barcoded surface markers included in our dataset ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Figure S2 C). Two of these clusters corresponded to ASCs, with both a short-lived plasmablast (PB) cluster, enriched for expression of cell proliferation-related genes, and non-dividing PCs. Both PB/PC populations were strongly reduced by 6 months, confirming the resolution with time of the primary extrafollicular response in these severe COVID-19 patients ( Figure 2 B; Table S2 ). The remaining B cells were separated in three populations: a mixture of naive/transitional B cells, a resting MBC population and a CD95 + activated cluster. This activated cluster could be further subdivided in three distinct populations: CD21 low CD27 + CD38 + CD71 + activated B cells (ABCs), CD21 low CD27 low CD38 − CD71 low CD11c + FcRL5 + cells, likely corresponding to atypical memory and/or double-negative 2 (DN2) population ( Sanz et al., 2019 49. Sanz, I. ∙ Wei, C. ∙ Jenks, S.A. ... Challenges and Opportunities for Consistent Classification of Human B Cell and Plasma Cell Populations Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :2458 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ), and CD21 + CD27 int/+ CD38 − CD71 low CD95 + cells corresponding to a cluster with intermediate characteristics between ABC and MBCs ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Figures S2 B and S2C). The contraction of the primary response, clearly observed for ASCs, could also be seen, albeit less pronounced, for ABCs, with a parallel increase in resting MBCs. All other clusters remained stable ( Figure 2 B).
To gain insight into the specificity of this B cell response and the clonal relationship between the different B cell clusters, we first used the initial burst of ASCs seen at M0 as a proxy for the overall SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell response. We thus focused on the top 10% ASC clones, which represents 40%–55% of the PB/PC analyzed ( Table S2 ). Analysis of these top 10% ASC clones revealed a strong link between the ABC cluster and the ASC population ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Figure S2 D; Table S2 ). The bimodal distribution of SHM seen in ASCs further suggests the existence of a strong extrafollicular reaction recruiting newly engaged naive and MBCs, which fuels the primary response toward SARS-CoV-2 ( Figures 2 G and 2H). In line with the resolution of the immune response, most of these clones were no longer present in ASCs 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with only few cells clonally related to the original ASC burst still detectable in residual PC, while they were increased in the resting MBC compartment by that time ( Figure 2 E; Figure S2 D). Parallel analysis of barcoded-S reads in our dataset allowed us to identify clear populations of S-specific ABCs and ASCs at M0 ( Figure 2 E; Figure S2 E; Table S2 ). By 6 months, S-barcoded-specific cells mainly localized in the resting MBC cluster ( Figure 2 E). We performed a second analysis of S-specific cells in our dataset, identified either as barcoded-S cells or as cells clonally related to cells identified as S-specific by single-cell culture, to increase their representation ( Figures S2 G and S2F; description in STAR methods ). We found limited clonal overlap of S-specific MBCs at M6 with the initial ASC response, suggesting that two distinct, albeit synchronous, responses take place in COVID-19 patients ( Figures S2 F–S2H; Table S2 ).
To further analyze the dynamics of the overall and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B cell response at the level of our entire cohort, we next performed multi-parametric FACS analysis using a flow panel that included seven surface markers identified in our scRNA-seq dataset as major markers of ABCs and ASC subsets involved in the initial response (CD19, CD21, CD27, CD38, CD71, CD11c, IgD, as well as His-tagged trimeric S protein). Unsupervised analysis of CD19 + IgD − switched B cell populations ( Figures S3 A–S3C), concatenated from 83 samples collected at M0, M3, and M6 from patients in our cohort, confirmed our initial observation that S-specific B cells were enriched in a cluster of CD27 + CD38 int/+ CD71 + ABCs and in ASCs at M0 ( Figures 3 A–3C; Table S3 ). The enrichment in ASCs was most prominent in S-CoV patients and is in line with the strong ASC burst seen in these patients ( Figure S3 A). S-specific ASCs were marginally detectable at 6 months, at which time point S-specific B cells mostly resided in the CD21 + CD27 + CD38 − CD71 int/− resting MBC compartment in both S-CoV and M-CoV convalescent patients. Of note, some S-specific cells were still found in the CD71 + ABC cluster at M6 in both groups of patients but were much less frequent in the DN2/atypical compartment ( Figure 3 C).
Based on these results, and using a more traditional gating strategy, we next focused our analysis on the switched CD27 + IgD − CD38 int/− MBC compartment, which includes both ABCs and resting MBCs ( Figure S1 D). The first overall analysis confirmed a contraction of the ASC compartment, with a stable size of both IgD − CD27 + B cells and ABCs with time ( Figures S3 D–S3F). In contrast to the rapid disappearance of S-specific ASCs, both the percentage and absolute number of S-specific CD27 + IgD − B cells appeared stable up to 6 months in the vast majority of patients in our cohort, and even continuously increased up to that time point in a subset of convalescent S-CoV patients ( Figures 3 D and 3E; Figures S3 G and S3H). Of note, and as previously mentioned, the double-negative population contained few S-specific cells ( Figures S3 I and S3J).
Convalescent S-CoV patients showed significantly higher frequencies of S-specific MBCs at the 6-month time point of our study. Most M-CoV patients, however, still harbored a sizeable population of S-specific MBCs at 6 months post-infection (mean 0.94% ± 0.17% of MBCs) and only one (M-CoV24) out of the 16 M-CoV patients analyzed at 6 months in our study showed a frequency of S-specific switched CD27 + MBCs below that of pre-pandemic healthy donors. Even more striking was that both M-CoV patients whose serum levels of S-specific IgG had dropped below detectable levels by 6 months (correlating with an absence of in vitro neutralizing potential) still harbored a clear population of S-specific MBCs at that time point (0.41% and 0.60% of MBCs, respectively, both above the threshold of 0.20% (>2 SD of the mean value observed in healthy donors). Altogether, these results demonstrate the induction of a robust and stable S-specific MBC population in both M- and S-CoV patients. Aside from severity, none of the clinical parameters or treatment that we could monitor, notably corticosteroids, appeared to have any clear influence on the long-term establishment of these S-specific MBCs ( Figures S3 M–S3Q).
To ensure that such stable levels of S-specific CD27 + switched MBCs did not simply reflect a sustained immune response in these convalescent COVID-19 patients, we further used CD19 and CD71 to separate ABCs (CD19 high CD71 + ) and resting MBCs (CD19 + CD71 low ) among S-specific cells over time, as previously described ( Ellebedy et al., 2016 10. Ellebedy, A.H. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ∙ Kissick, H.T. ... Defining antigen-specific plasmablast and memory B cell subsets in human blood after viral infection or vaccination Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1226-1234 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ). Confirming our initial observation in the four S-CoV patients included in the scRNA-seq dataset ( Figure 2 E) and the clear enrichment of S-specific B cells in cluster 3 of our unsupervised FACS analysis ( Figures 3 A–3C), the majority of S-specific MBCs displayed a CD19 high CD71 + ABC phenotype in the days following infection ( Figure 3 F). In both S-CoV and M-CoV patients, the proportion of S-specific ABCs steadily decreased over time, along with an increase of S-specific classical, resting MBCs ( Figures 3 G and 3H). Interestingly, ABCs were still detectable in both cohorts at 6 months (approximately 20% in both cohorts), suggesting continued antigen-driven activation, as has been described after Ebola infection ( Davis et al., 2019 9. Davis, C.W. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ∙ McElroy, A.K. ... Longitudinal Analysis of the Human B Cell Response to Ebola Virus Infection Cell. 2019; 177 :1566-1582.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). In S-CoV patients, a small fraction of these early responding MBCs expressed the transcription factor T-bet, but such expression appeared only transient ( Figures S3 K and 3L). More interestingly, we noted a significantly higher frequency of ABCs among S-specific MBCs in S-CoV as compared to M-CoV patients, as well as a large inter-patient variability for this parameter in both groups ( Figure 3 G). This heterogeneity could not be simply explained by inter-patient variations in the time of initial sampling. To evaluate whether early B cell activation may impact later formation of MBCs, we plotted the frequency of CD27 + CD71 + ABC cells at M0 versus the frequency of S-specific MBCs at M6. Interestingly, there was a positive, albeit modest, correlation between both values, indicating that such early B cell activation does not prevent the development of B cell memory against SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3 I).
In order to better understand the origin, fine specificity, and developmental pathways involved in the generation of MBCs against SARS-CoV-2, we next performed single-cell sorting and culture of S-specific MBCs at 3 and 6 months post-infection in all four donors previously analyzed in the context of our scRNA-seq experiment ( Figure 1 E). A total of 2,412 cells at M3 and 2,423 cells at M6 were sorted from the four donors ( Table S4 ), and 488 and 1,027 supernatants (respectively at M3 and M6) post single-cell culture were tested for specificity against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, S proteins from two other related seasonal betacoronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43) ( Huang et al., 2020 18. Huang, A.T. ∙ Garcia-Carreras, B. ∙ Hitchings, M.D.T. ... A systematic review of antibody mediated immunity to coronaviruses: kinetics, correlates of protection, and association with severity Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4704 Crossref Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is the main target of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients ( Figures 4 A; Table S4 ). We found that a sizeable proportion of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific MBCs also recognized the S protein of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, with many of these cells recognizing both, as previously reported ( Shrock et al., 2020 54. Shrock, E. ∙ Fujimura, E. ∙ Kula, T. ... Viral epitope profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals cross-reactivity and correlates of severity Science. 2020; 370 :eabd4250 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wec et al., 2020 64. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Wrapp, D. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ... Broad neutralization of SARS-related viruses by human monoclonal antibodies Science. 2020; 369 :731-736 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). The proportion of HCoV-HKU1- and HCoV-OC43-specific MBC clones, however, readily decreased between M3 and M6 (12.4% ± 4.9% to 4.8% ± 1.7% respectively), suggesting that these specificities, while actively participating in the early response, are not preferentially recruited in the later MBC compartment. In contrast, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific MBC clones clearly increased between the M3 and M6 time points in all donors (11.1% ± 2.1% and 26.3% ± 5.1% respectively) ( Figures 4 A and 4B; Figure S4 A). SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones were mostly sorted from resting CD71 − CD27 + switched MBCs at these late time points ( Figures S4 B and S4C) and were detectable within the same proportion in M-CoV and S-Cov patients at 6 months ( Figure 4 B). Finally, only a minority of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones cross-reacted with HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 S protein, as anticipated by the low similarity of the RBD domain between these different viruses ( Figures 4 A). Overall, these results suggested an early and rapid recruitment of cross-reactive MBCs through the extrafollicular pathway, in parallel with the establishment of a new immune response against epitopes unique to SARS-CoV-2, with a delayed and progressive output of MBCs.
To evaluate whether such MBC output corresponds to an ongoing GC response, we next evaluated the occurrence and evolution of somatic mutations in S-specific MBCs. Heavy-chain V H sequencing from SARS-CoV-2 S- or RBD-specific wells ( Table S4 ) in our in vitro culture assay, at both M3 and M6 ( Figure S4 D), allowed us to identify clonal relationships with sequences obtained in our scRNA-seq dataset at both M0 and M6. Mutations in V H sequences of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific clones at M0 displayed a bimodal distribution with both near germline and highly mutated sequences. In line with an initial recruitment of cross-reactive MBCs into the anti-SARS-CoV-2 early humoral response, HCoV-HKU1- and HCoV-OC43-specific clones contained sequences that were already highly mutated at M0 ( Figure 4 C). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones displayed low mutation numbers in V H sequences, as previously described in numerous studies during the early stages of this pandemic ( Brouwer et al., 2020 4.

Both early SARS-CoV-2 S- and RBD-specific Ig V H sequences showed high levels of convergence between donors in our dataset but also with published SARS-CoV-2 S- and RBD-specific antibody sequences (43/874 sequences in clonal relationship with cells from our dataset) ( Figure S4 E). Although near germline sequences were initially present in S-specific clones, and even predominated in those with SARS-CoV-2 RBD specificity in both our M0 dataset and in the literature, longitudinal tracking of clonal relationships at 3 and 6 months revealed a progressive acquisition of mutations in V H sequences over time ( Figures 4 D–4E; Figures S4 G and S4H). Most importantly, over 85% of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific culture supernatants at M6 showed intermediate to strong neutralizing potential against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in S-CoV patients and over 50% in M-CoV patients ( Figure 4 F; Figure S4 I; Table S4 ). Progressive accumulation of mutations in V H sequences was not associated with a loss of neutralization potential ( Figure 4 G; Table S4 ). In contrast, a strong neutralizing capacity was identified along lineage trees including previously described near-germline anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies and the mutated versions that we identified at M6 in this work. ( Figures 4 H and S4 J). Dynamics of such clones and emergence of highly mutated neutralizing sequences, along with the robustness of the memory response observed in S-CoV and M-CoV patients, demonstrate that MBCs bearing unique specificities and neutralizing potential against SARS-CoV-2 can expand and mature over time through an ongoing GC response.

Section: Discussion

The long-term stability of humoral immune memory following viral infection is provided by separate pools of protective LLPCs and MBCs that can last for a lifetime ( Amanna et al., 2007 1. Amanna, I.J. ∙ Carlson, N.E. ∙ Slifka, M.K. Duration of humoral immunity to common viral and vaccine antigens N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 :1903-1915 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ; Crotty et al., 2003 7. Crotty, S. ∙ Felgner, P. ∙ Davies, H. ... Cutting edge: long-term B cell memory in humans after smallpox vaccination J. Immunol. 2003; 171 :4969-4973 Crossref Scopus (544) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mamani-Matsuda et al., 2008 32. Mamani-Matsuda, M. ∙ Cosma, A. ∙ Weller, S. ... The human spleen is a major reservoir for long-lived vaccinia virus-specific memory B cells Blood. 2008; 111 :4653-4659 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon reinfection, long-lived MBCs generate a new wave of short-lived PCs and LLPCs while preserving the pool of MBCs. In this study, we focused on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with mild or severe disease and investigated the establishment of humoral memory and how this memory relates to the primary B cell response that emerges at the early stage of infection.
Experimental infections of volunteers with betacoronaviruses responsible for common colds and longitudinal serological studies have suggested the absence of durable immunity against these seasonal infections ( Sariol and Perlman, 2020 50. Sariol, A. ∙ Perlman, S. Lessons for COVID-19 Immunity from Other Coronavirus Infections Immunity. 2020; 53 :248-263 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, early reports have shown potentially defective GC formation in S-CoV patients in the intensive care unit ( Kaneko et al., 2020 23. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.-H. ∙ Boucau, J. ..., Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness Specimen Working Group Loss of Bcl-6-Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and Germinal Centers in COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 183 :143-157.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ) and predominantly near-germline anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies ( Ju et al., 2020 21. Ju, B. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Ge, J. ... Human neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection Nature. 2020; 584 :115-119 Crossref Scopus (1174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nielsen et al., 2020 40. Nielsen, S.C.A. ∙ Yang, F. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ...

Such observations suggested a strong bias of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response toward the extrafollicular pathway in these patients, which may preclude the formation of long-term memory.
Our study demonstrates, in contrast, a remarkable stability of the overall S-specific MBC population up to 6 months after infection, and even its expansion in severe patients, extending recent observations on memory persistence in COVID-19 ( Gaebler et al., 2021 13. Gaebler, C. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Lorenzi, J.C.C. ... Evolution of Antibody Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (1073) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rodda et al., 2020 47. Rodda, L.B. ∙ Netland, J. ∙ Shehata, L. ... Functional SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory persists after mild COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 184 :169-183.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is also consistent with recent results showing in a large cohort of patients that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific MBCs persist up to 8 months after infection ( Dan et al., 2021 8. Dan, J.M. ∙ Mateus, J. ∙ Kato, Y. ... Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection Science. 2021; eabf4063 Crossref Scopus (1829) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Tracking of S-specific B cells provided a more complex picture than previously anticipated, characterized by two synchronous responses with distinct dynamics throughout the extrafollicular reaction. Indeed, near-germline B cell clones recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were mobilized but also pre-existing highly mutated MBCs specific for the S protein of other seasonal betacoronaviruses.
The longitudinal VDJ sequencing of S-specific MBCs revealed that neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones, including convergent antibody rearrangements across donors, accumulated with time and acquired somatic mutations in their V H genes, the hallmark of a GC-dependent immune response. Such GC imprinting is of major importance because it usually predicts the generation of long-lived MBCs ( Mesin et al., 2016 37. Mesin, L. ∙ Ersching, J. ∙ Victora, G.D. Germinal center B cell dynamics Immunity. 2016; 45 :471-482 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). Along this line, a recent report observed the presence of viral proteins in the intestine of patients several months after the initial diagnostic, which could sustain such B cell response ( Gaebler et al., 2021 13. Gaebler, C. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Lorenzi, J.C.C. ... Evolution of Antibody Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (1073) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cross-reactivity against the S domain of betacoronaviruses has already been documented in serological studies showing reactivity to conserved regions of the S protein ( Aydillo et al., 2020 2. Aydillo, T. ∙ Rombauts, A. ∙ Stadlbauer, D. ... Antibody Immunological Imprinting on COVID-19 Patients MedRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 63.

Ng, K.W. ∙ Faulkner, N. ∙ Cornish, G.H. ... Preexisting and de novo humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in humans Science. 2020; 370 :1339-1343 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ), and by cross-reactivity of sorted S-specific B cells with seasonal coronavirus ( Song et al., 2020 56.

Cross-reactive serum and memory B cell responses to spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronavirus infection BioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Wec et al., 2020 64. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Wrapp, D. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ... Broad neutralization of SARS-related viruses by human monoclonal antibodies Science. 2020; 369 :731-736 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such cross-reactivity also exists for T cells ( Braun et al., 2020 3. Braun, J. ∙ Loyal, L. ∙ Frentsch, M. ...

Le Bert, N. ∙ Tan, A.T. ∙ Kunasegaran, K. ... SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls Nature. 2020; 584 :457-462 Crossref Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ), but its protective potential remains debated ( Ng et al., 2020 38. Ng, K.W. ∙ Faulkner, N. ∙ Cornish, G.H. ... Preexisting and de novo humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in humans Science. 2020; 370 :1339-1343 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). The proportion of cross-reactive clones, however, decreased from 3 to 6 months, suggesting that, after an initial activation, these cross-reactive clones were not positively selected in the memory pool.
As observed previously by others for antibody titers ( Ripperger et al., 2020 45. Ripperger, T.J. ∙ Uhrlaub, J.L. ∙ Watanabe, M. ... Orthogonal SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays Enable Surveillance of Low-Prevalence Communities and Reveal Durable Humoral Immunity Immunity. 2020; 53 :925-933.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), the overall strength and stability of the MBC response was positively correlated with the initial severity of COVID-19-associated pathologies in convalescent patients. Interestingly, the magnitude of the initial SARS-CoV-2-specific ABC response was not predictive of an impaired B cell memory, displaying in contrast a positive, albeit modest, correlation with the frequency of S-specific MBCs at 6 months. ABCs in COVID-19 patients have been previously reported with various phenotypes ( Juno et al., 2020 22. Juno, J.A. ∙ Tan, H.-X. ∙ Lee, W.S. ...

Extrafollicular B cell responses correlate with neutralizing antibodies and morbidity in COVID-19 Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1506-1516 Crossref Scopus (449) PubMed Google Scholar ), including a double-negative CD11c-positive population (DN2). One study has also suggested the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific DN2 cells as a correlate of critical illness ( Kaneko et al., 2020 23. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.-H. ∙ Boucau, J. ..., Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness Specimen Working Group Loss of Bcl-6-Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and Germinal Centers in COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 183 :143-157.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found here that most S-responding B cells harbored an activated phenotype that notably differed from DN2 but was similar to the one described after Ebola or influenza virus infection ( Ellebedy et al., 2016 10. Ellebedy, A.H. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ∙ Kissick, H.T. ... Defining antigen-specific plasmablast and memory B cell subsets in human blood after viral infection or vaccination Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1226-1234 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ). These SARS-CoV-2 S-specific ABCs were in a clonal relationship with expanded cells from the initial burst of ASCs and also with resting MBCs that persisted at 6 months. Given the limited clonal overlap between the early ASC burst and the later mutated MBC response, it is tempting to suggest that a distinct part of ABCs is dedicated to fueling the GC response in these patients while another part contributes to the ASC burst. Of note, the ABC population remains detectable up to 6 months post-infection in convalescent patients, with some, albeit few, S-specific cells, suggesting, as described for Ebola ( Davis et al., 2019 9. Davis, C.W. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ∙ McElroy, A.K. ... Longitudinal Analysis of the Human B Cell Response to Ebola Virus Infection Cell. 2019; 177 :1566-1582.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ), an antigen-driven activation that persisted for months after infection.
Collectively, taking into account this report and previous studies, the COVID-19 infection seems in most non-critical cases to induce both an immediate, possibly protective antibody response, together with the ongoing maturation of MBCs, which should give rise to neutralizing ASCs upon reinfection. While this overall picture is positive, notably in the context of vaccine campaigns to come, the long-term duration of the protective MBC response remains an open question.
The relatively small size of the cohort does not allow us to identify patients’ characteristics that would predict the maintenance of the immune memory. Furthermore, patients with S- and M-CoV were not matched for age and comorbidities, thus differences between these two groups must be interpreted with caution. Finally, this study did not investigate whether MBCs are generated after asymptomatic COVID-19. Thus, larger cohorts of individuals with a wider spectrum of disease severity would be mandatory in the future to provide a comprehensive picture of B cell memory against SARS-CoV-2.

In total 39 patients with COVID-19 were recruited. We included 21 COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen (S-CoV) and 18 healthcare workers, with a mild COVID-19 disease (M-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as confirmed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal swab or clinical presentation associated with typical aspect on CT-scan and/or serological evidence. Samples were collected in mean 18.8 (±SD: 8.8 days) days after disease onset in S-CoV, and in mean 35.5 days (±SD: 12.8 days) for M-CoV. Samples were additionally collected 3 months (mean ± SD: 89.8 ± 15.8 days for S-CoV and 94.2 ± 8.2 for M-CoV), and 6 months (mean ± SD: 170.5 ± 12.9 days for S-CoV and 184.6 ± 10.2 for M-CoV) after onset. Clinical and biological characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table S1 . B cells from four S-CoV patients were further analyzed by scRNaseq, these four patients being selected for the absence of specific treatment (corticosteroids, IL6/IL6R inhibitors) that could interfere with the B cell response. Patients were recruited at Henri Mondor University Hospital (AP-HP), between March and May 2020. Samples from healthy donors were obtained at EFS Henri-Mondor and frozen before 2019. MEMO-COV-2 study (NCT04402892) was approved by the ethical committee Ile-de-France VI (Number: 40-20 HPS), and was performed in accordance with the French law. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in transport media and plasma samples were held at 4°C (or −80°C if > 12 h) prior to testing on the Alinity M SARS CoV-2 Amp kit and/or Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 kit. The GeneXpert ®Dx System (Cepheid) and Alinity M (Abbott) performed automated specimen processing and real-time RT-PCR analysis. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 kit detects N and E genes of the SARS CoV-2 genome; Alinity M SARS CoV-2 Amp kit detects RdRp and N genes.
Serological assays were performed for IgG anti-N, IgG anti-S and total antibodies (ab) anti-S detection. Serum samples were processed for anti-Nucloprotein (N) detection on Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay following the manufacturer’s instructions. Serum samples were further analyzed using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products, for IgG anti-spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 detection and for total Ab anti-spike (S) detection (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics). All assays were performed by trained laboratory technicians according to the respective manufacturer’s standard procedures. Qualitative results and index values reported by the instruments were used in analysis.
The human coronavirus Spike (S) proteins were expressed as ectodomains that were stabilized to preserve their trimeric prefusion conformation. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (residues 1-1208) was stabilized by introducing six proline substitutions (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P, K986P, V987P), a GSAS substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685) and a C-terminal Foldon trimerization motif ( Hsieh et al., 2020 17. Hsieh, C.-L. ∙ Goldsmith, J.A. ∙ Schaub, J.M. ... Structure-based design of prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes Science. 2020; 369 :1501-1505 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by Hisx8 and Strep tags. This construct was cloned with its endogenous signal peptide in pcDNA3.1(+). The OC43 S ectodomain (residues 15-1263) was cloned in the pCAGGS vector with a CD5 N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal GCN4 trimerization motif, a thrombin cleavage site and a single Strep-tag. Additionally, it contains mutations to abolish the furin cleavage (754-RRSRG-758 to 754-GGSGG-758) at the S1-S2 junction ( Tortorici et al., 2019 60. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Walls, A.C. ∙ Lang, Y. ... Structural basis for human coronavirus attachment to sialic acid receptors Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :481-489 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ). The HKU1-CoV S protein (residues 14-1276) was stabilized by a double-proline mutation (N1067P, L1068P), the substitution of the RRSRG motif by GGSGG (residues 754-758) to avoid a potential S1/S2 furin cleavage, and a C-terminal Foldon motif. This construct was cloned in pcDNA3.1(+) with an IgK signal peptide and a thrombin cleavage site at the C terminus that was followed by a Hisx8 tag.
The SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) was cloned in pcDNA3.1(+) encompassing residues 331-528 from the Spike ectodomain, and it was flanked by an N-terminal IgK signal peptide and a C-terminal Thrombin cleavage site followed by a Hisx8-tag.
The plasmids coding for the recombinant proteins were transiently transfected in Expi293F™ cells (Thermo Fischer) using FectroPRO® DNA transfection reagent (Polyplus), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 days and then the culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was concentrated. The proteins were purified from the supernatant by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The first purification step was performed using StrepTactin columns (IBA) (SARS-CoV-2 S, OC43 S) or His-Trap™ Excel columns (GE Healthcare) (HKU1 S, SARS-CoV-2 RBD). The different S ectodomains were further purified using a Superose6 10/300 colum (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS, while a Superdex200 10/300 column was used for SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
PBMCs were isolated from venous blood samples via standard density gradient centrifugation and used after cryopreservation at −150°C. Cells were thawed using RPMI-1640 (GIBCO) 10% FBS, washed twice and incubated with 10 μg of the SARS-CoV-2 His-tagged spike protein in 100 μL of PBS (GIBCO) 2% FBS during 20 min on ice. Cells were washed and resuspended in the same conditions, then the fluorochrome-conjugated antibody cocktail including the 2 anti-His antibodieswas added at pre-titrated concentrations for 20 min at 4°C and viable cells were identified using a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) incubated with conjugated antibodies (see key resources table ). If a permeabilization was needed (T-Bet staining), cells were washed and resuspended in 250 μL of Fix/perm (eBioscience) for 25 min, then washed with appropriate buffer before adding the conjugated antibody on the cell pellet for a further 25 min at 4°C. Samples were acquired using a LSR Fortessa SORP (BD Biosciences). For cell sorting, cells were stained using the same protocol and then sorted in 96 plates using an ultra-purity mode on a MA900 cell sorter (SONY), or Aria III (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with FlowJo or Kaluza softwares. Detailed gating strategies for individual markers are depicted in Figure S1 . Control samples included PMBC collected from heathy donors before SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and incubation of S-CoV and M-CoV samples with anti-His antibodies but no His-tagged spike protein to determine the labeling background.
For UMAP generation and visualization ( Figures 3 A–3C), data from all 83 samples from patients with complete panel acquisition at M0, M3 and M6 ( Table S1 ) in our dataset were individually down-sampled to 3000 cells each using the Downsample (v3.3) plugin in FlowJO. All samples were subsequently concatenated and FlowJO UMAP (v3.1) plugin was used to calculate the UMAP coordinates for the resulting 249,000 cells (with 30 neighbors, metric = euclidian and minimum distance = 0.5 as default parameters) ( Figure 3 A). The FlowSOM plugin was used in parallel on the same downsampled dataset to create a self-organizing map (using n = 9 clusters as default parameter) ( Figure 3 B). Upsampling was then performed via the FlowSOM plugin by applying this self-organizing map to the initial FCS files from all 83 samples to calculate both total and spike-specific memory B cell repartition in identified clusters on all collected cells for each donor ( Figure 3 C; Figure S3 A; Table S3 ). Both UMAP and FlowSOM plugin were run taking into account fluorescent intensities from the following parameters: FSC-A, SSC-A, CD19, CD21, CD11c, CD71, CD38, CD27 and IgD. Contour plots (equal probability contouring, with levels set to 5% of gated populations) for each identified cluster were further overlaid on UMAP projection in FlowJO. For visualization purposes, only the outermost density representing 95% of the total gated cells was kept for the final figure ( Figure 3 B), all other levels were removed in Adobe Illustrator.
Single cell culture was performed as previously described ( Crickx et al., 2019 6. Crickx, E. ∙ Chappert, P. ∙ Weller, S. ... A reservoir of rituximab-resistant splenic memory B cells contributes to relapses after B-cell depletion therapy bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ): single B cells were sorted in 96-well plates containing MS40 cells expressing CD40L (kind gift from G. Kelsoe). Cells were co-cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 during 21 or 25 days in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% HyClone FBS (Thermo Scientific), 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and MEM non-essential amino acids (all Invitrogen), with the addition of recombinant human BAFF (10 ng/mL), IL2 (50 ng/mL), IL4 (10 ng/mL), and IL21 (10 ng/mL; all Peprotech). Part of the supernatant was carefully removed at days 4, 8, 12, 15 and 18 and the same amount of fresh medium with cytokines was added to the cultures. After 21 days of single cell culture, supernatants were harvested and stored at −20°C. Cell pellets were placed on ice and gently washed with PBS (GIBCO) before being resuspended in 50 μL of RLT buffer (QIAGEN) supplemented with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and subsequently stored at −80°C until further processing.
IgG and SARS-CoV-2, HKU1-CoV and OC43-CoV spike-specific IgG from culture supernatants were detected by home-made ELISA. Briefly, 96 well ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with either goat anti-human Ig (10 μg/mL, Invitrogen) or recombinant SARS-CoV-2, HKU1 or OC43 spike or SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (2.5 μg/mL each) in sodium carbonate during 1 h at 37°C. After plate blocking, cell culture supernatants were added for 1 h, then ELISA were developed using HRP-goat anti-human IgG (1 μg/mL, Immunotech) and TMB substrate (Eurobio). OD450 and OD620 were measured and Ab-reactivity was calculated after subtraction of blank wells. Supernatants whose ratio of OD450-OD620 over control well (consisting of supernatant from wells that contained single-cell sorted spike-negative memory B cells from the same single cell culture assay) was over 3 were considered as positive for RBD ELISA. A cut-off at a ratio of 5 was chosen for HKU1 and OC43 spike ELISA. PBS was used to define background OD450-OD620.
Clones whose culture had proven successful (IgG concentration ≥1 μg/mL at day 21-25) were selected and extracted using the NucleoSpin96 RNA extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. A reverse transcription step was then performed using the SuperScript IV enzyme (ThermoFisher) in a 14 μL final volume (42°C 10 min, 25°C 10 min, 50°C 60 min, 94°C 5 min) with 4 μl of RNA and random hexamers (GE Healthcare). A PCR was further performed based on the protocol established by Tiller et al. ( Tiller et al., 2008 59. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 3.5 μL of cDNA was used as template and amplified in a total volume of 40 μL with a mix of forward L-VH primers ( Table S4 ) and reverse Cγ primer and using the HotStar® Taq DNA polymerase (QIAGEN) and 50 cycles of PCR (94°C 30 s, 58°C 30 s, 72°C 60 s). PCR products were sequenced with the reverse primer CHG-D1 and read on ABI PRISM 3130XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence quality was verified with the CodonCode Aligner software (CodonCode Corporation) and data were analyzed with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST web portal (from The International Immunogenetics Information System) or in parallel with the VDJ sequences generated as part of our scRNA-seq dataset (see below).
Unconjugated anti-His antibodies were purchased from Biolegend and custom oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, following the 10X Genomics protocol available at https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/overview/doc/demonstrated-protocol-cell-surface-protein-labeling-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing-protocols and the barcode whitelist. Sequences of the 2 HPLC purified barcoded oligonucleotides were: /5AmMC12/CGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGNNNNNNNNNNTGCATAGCCTGTGGANNNNNNNNNCCCATATAAGAAA and /5AmMC12/CGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGNNNNNNNNNNCTCTCCAATGTACTCNNNNNNNNNCCCATATAAGAAA. Oligonucleotide antibody conjugation was performed using the Oligonucleotide Conjugation Kit from Abcam, according to the manufacturer instructions using an oligonucleotide/antibody ratio of 5:1.
Peripheral (CD3 - CD14 - CD15 - CD56 - CD19 + IgD - ) B cells were FACS-sorted (MA900, Sony) in PBS/0.08% FCS from 4 patients (S-CoV) at baseline (M0) and 6 months (M6). 5x10 4 to 10x10 5 cells were obtained for each subset. The scRNA-seq libraries were generated using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kit v.1.1 with Feature Barcoding (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression (mRNA), ADT and VDJ BCR libraries were constructed. Briefly, cells were counted and up to 20 000 cells were loaded in the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller to generate single-cell gel-beads in emulsion. After reverse transcription, gel-beads in emulsion were disrupted. Barcoded complementary DNA was isolated and amplified by PCR. Following fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing, sample indexes were added during index PCR. The purified libraries were sequenced on a Novaseq S2 flowcell (Illumina) with 26 cycles of read 1, 8 cycles of i7 index and 91 cycles of read 2, targeting a median depth of 50000 reads per cell for gene expression and 5000 reads per cell for each other two libraries (BCR VDJ and ADT Feature barcoding).
Paired-end FASTQ reads for all three libraries were demultiplexed and aligned against the GRCh38 human reference genome (GENCODE v32/Ensembl 98; July 2020) using 10X Genomics’ Cell Ranger v4.0.0 pipeline. Outputs of Cell Ranger were directly loaded into Seurat v3.2.2 ( Stuart et al., 2019 57. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar ) for further QC steps and analysis. Following manual inspection of cell quality, only genes detected in at least 10 cells and cells with more than 500 unique genes detected and less than 25% of UMI counts mapped to mitochondrial genes were kept. Reads mapping to the immunoglobulin gene locus were further stored in a separate assay at this step to avoid unwanted clustering based solely on differential isotype expression and cells with exactly one heavy chain sequence were retained for final analysis. UMI counts were then log-normalized. The top 2,000 highly variable genes were identified using the FindVariableFeatures() function in Seurat and the default vst method. Normalized counts were then scaled and centered using the ScaleData() function, removing unwanted variation related to the percentage of mitochondrial UMI counts at that step. After principal component analysis, potential donor and sort-specific batch effects were removed using the Harmony algorithm ( Korsunsky et al., 2019 24. Korsunsky, I. ∙ Millard, N. ∙ Fan, J. ... Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1289-1296 Crossref Scopus (2446) PubMed Google Scholar ). The first 30 corrected PCA dimensions were then used to construct a knn graph (k = 20 neighbors) and perform graph-based clustering (Louvain) with a resolution parameter of 0.2 as well as compute the UMAP coordinates for each cell. Further separation of the “Activated” cell cluster was performed using a resolution parameter of 0.4. Two small clusters with T cell (0.2%) and monocyte (0.1%) signatures were removed from further analysis as clear doublets, as well as a separate cluster of poor quality cells (2.1% of all cells), grouped solely based on high percentages of mitochondrial UMI count. G2M and S cell cycle signatures were calculated using the CellCycleScoring() function and the associated gene lists in Seurat (G2M scoring: HMGB2, CDK1, NUSAP1, UBE2C, BIRC5, TPX2, TOP2A, NDC80, CKS2, NUF2, CKS1B, MKI67, TMPO, CENPF, TACC3, FAM64A, SMC4, CCNB2, CKAP2L, CKAP2, AURKB, BUB1, KIF11, ANP32E, TUBB4B, GTSE1, KIF20B, HJURP, CDCA3, HN1, CDC20, TTK, CDC25C, KIF2C, RANGAP1, NCAPD2, DLGAP5, CDCA2, CDCA8, ECT2, KIF23, HMMR, AURKA, PSRC1, ANLN, LBR, CKAP5, CENPE, CTCF, NEK2, G2E3, GAS2L3, CBX5, CENPA; S scoring: MCM5, PCNA, TYMS, FEN1, MCM2, MCM4, RRM1, UNG, GINS2, MCM6, CDCA7, DTL, PRIM1, UHRF1, MLF1IP, HELLS, RFC2, RPA2, NASP, RAD51AP1, GMNN, WDR76, SLBP, CCNE2, UBR7, POLD3, MSH2, ATAD2, RAD51, RRM2, CDC45, CDC6, EXO1, TIPIN, DSCC1, BLM, CASP8AP2, USP1, CLSPN, POLA1, CHAF1B, BRIP1, E2F8).

Non-productively rearranged sequences were removed at that step as well as sequences from cells that did not pass the initial QC cut-offs from our scRNA-seq analysis. Cases of 10X Genomics barcodes with two or more consensus heavy chain sequences for which more than ten UMI were detected were generally flagged as potential doublets for removal from our scRNA-seq analysis. Similarly, cases where no clear heavy chains could be attributed (none above 10 UMIs) were also flagged for removal. Two exceptions were made: 1/ in cases of identical CDR3s but differing isotypes (c_call), in which case the isotype switched sequence was kept and UMI counts from both contigs were aggregated; and 2/ in cases when one the heavy chains was clearly over represented at the UMI level and the second most represented sequences did not exceed ten UMIs, in which case the most represented sequence was kept.
Clonal cluster assignment (DefineClones.py) and germline reconstruction (CreateGermlines.py) was performed using the Immcantation/Change-O toolkit ( Gupta et al., 2015 15. Gupta, N.T. ∙ Vander Heiden, J.A. ∙ Uduman, M. ... Change-O: a toolkit for analyzing large-scale B cell immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3356-3358 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ) on all heavy chain V sequences. Sequences that had the same V-gene, same J-gene, including ambiguous assignments, and same CDR3 length with maximal length normalized nucleotide hamming distance of 0.15 were considered as potentially belonging to the same clonal group. Mutation frequencies in V genes were then calculated using the calcObservedMutations() function from Immcantation/SHazaM v1.0.2 R package. For the analysis of the initial ASC response in our 10X Genomics dataset ( Figures 2 E and 2F), clonal assignments were further corrected using available light chain information (light_cluster.py script from Immcantation). Further clonal analyses were implemented in R.
Based on light chain-corrected clonal affectation, clones were ranked based on the total number of ASC (PC + PB) from the M0 time point of our analysis found in each clone for each individual donor. Clones with equal number of ASC were further ranked based on their total number of Activated and MBC cells from the M0 time point of our analysis. The top ten percent highest ranked clones were further labeled as Top 10% ASC clones ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Figure S2 D). Based on heavy-chain only clonal affectation, clones were defined as SARS-CoV-2 S specific (Spike-specific clones) if they contained 1 or more validated single-cell culture sequence or if more than ten percent of the cells from that clone were positively stained by our barcoded His-tagged S protein in our scRNaseq dataset. All Spike-specific clones described in Figure 4 and Figures S2 F and S2G were manually curated based on available light chain information (10X Genomics and published antibodies only) and CDR3 sequences. Cut-off for positive staining with barcoded His-tagged S protein in our scRNaseq dataset were set at log normalized count values of 1.2 for both barcodes. Cells in clonal relationship with single-cell culture sequences at the M6 time point served as reference ( Figure S4 F). Clones were defined as SARS-CoV-2 RBD or HKU1/OC43 spike-specific ( Figures 4 C–4G) if they contained 1 or more validated single-cell culture sequence with a positive ELISA against one of these proteins. Graphics were obtained using the ggplot2 v3.3.2 and circlize v0.4.10 packages. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Immcantation/IgPhyML toolkit (Immcantation/suite v4.0.0 docker image) and further visualized in R using the Alakazam v1.0.2 and igraph v1.2.6 packages.
Virus neutralization was evaluated by a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). Vero E6 cells were seeded at 2x10 4 cells/well in a 96-well plate 24 h before the assay. Two hundred focus-forming units (ffu) of Sars-CoV-2 virus (BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 strain, a kind gift from the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses at Institut Pasteur, Paris, originally supplied through the European Virus Archive goes Global platform) were pre-incubated with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera or supernatant from B cell clones for 1 h at 37°C before infection of cells. After 2 h infection, the virus/antibody mix was removed and foci were left to develop in presence of 1.5% methylcellulose for 2 days. Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and foci were revealed using either a rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 N or a human anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (H2-162) antibody and matching secondary HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Foci were visualized by diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining and counted using an Immunospot S6 Analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited CTL). Purified IgG from healthy donors were used as negative controls (TEM10 at 100 μg/mL; TEM11 at 90 μg/mL; TEM13 at 130 μg/mL) and purified human monoclonal C3-235 as positive control (IC 50 0.3 nM). Percentage of virus neutralization was calculated as (100 - (#foci Ab / #foci control) ∗ 100). The total amount of IgG present in the supernatants from B cells varied between S-CoV (12 μg/mL ± 7.6) and M-CoV patients (48 μg/mL ± 26). Neutralization values were normalized to the total IgG concentration present in the supernatant. As the neutralization activity may not linearly correlate with the amount of IgG, such normalization may lead to an underestimate of the neutralizing potency of B cell supernatants from M-CoV patients. Variation of the assay in weak neutralizers (i.e., < 50%) was due to intrinsic variation in counting.
Repeated Measures (RM) two-way ANOVA, Sidak’s multiple comparison tests, Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare continuous variables as appropriate (indicated in Figures). A P -value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses involved use of GraphPad Prism 8.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA).
