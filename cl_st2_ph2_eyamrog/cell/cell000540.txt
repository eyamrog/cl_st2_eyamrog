Title: Magnesium sensing via LFA-1 regulates CD8 + T cell effector function


Abstract: Summary

The relevance of extracellular magnesium in cellular immunity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the co-stimulatory cell-surface molecule LFA-1 requires magnesium to adopt its active conformation on CD8 + T cells, thereby augmenting calcium flux, signal transduction, metabolic reprogramming, immune synapse formation, and, as a consequence, specific cytotoxicity. Accordingly, magnesium-sufficiency sensed via LFA-1 translated to the superior performance of pathogen- and tumor-specific T cells, enhanced effectiveness of bi-specific T cell engaging antibodies, and improved CAR T cell function. Clinically, low serum magnesium levels were associated with more rapid disease progression and shorter overall survival in CAR T cell and immune checkpoint antibody-treated patients. LFA-1 thus directly incorporates information on the composition of the microenvironment as a determinant of outside-in signaling activity. These findings conceptually link co-stimulation and nutrient sensing and point to the magnesium-LFA-1 axis as a therapeutically amenable biologic system.

Section: Introduction

Low dietary Mg 2+ intake and hypomagnesemia have been implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases, including infection and cancer ( Costello and Nielsen, 2017 7.

Rev. 1995; 53 :71-74 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only limited experimental data are available exploring how organismal Mg 2+ abundance may affect the immune system. It has been reported, however, that in mice fed a Mg 2+ -deficient diet, (1) metastatic spread of carcinoma cells was accelerated ( Nasulewicz et al., 2004 41.

Acta. 2004; 1739 :26-32 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), and (2) immune responses against influenza were impaired due to insufficient inducible T cell kinase (ITK) activity ( Kanellopoulou et al., 2019 26. Kanellopoulou, C. ∙ George, A.B. ∙ Masutani, E. ... Mg2+ regulation of kinase signaling and immune function J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :1828-1842 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether in these models an effect of extracellular Mg 2+ was contributing to shaping adaptive immune responses has not been assessed.
CD8 + T cells are a key component of the adaptive immune system, playing a critical role in recognizing and eliminating infected or malignantly transformed cells. Immune surveillance of peripheral tissues by effector-memory (EM) CD8 + T cells is a challenging task, requiring adaptation to constantly changing microenvironments with highly variable nutrient and oxygen content ( Bantug et al., 2018 4.

Sensing between reactions - how the metabolic microenvironment shapes immunity Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2019; 197 :161-169 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether and, if so, how Mg 2+ availability in tissues is sensed and integrated functionally by CD8 + T cells has not been investigated.

Section: Results

First, we explored how Mg 2+ affected memory CD8 + T cell function in vitro , using complete media containing 1.2 mM Mg 2+ versus no Mg 2+ as the only difference. Analysis of metabolic flux profiles revealed that rapid induction of glycolysis of human EM CD8 + T cells (defined as CD45RA − and CD62L − ) activated by injection of soluble anti-CD3 and anti-28 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was blunted in the absence of Mg 2+ . This deficit was reverted when adding back Mg 2+ just prior to activation ( Figure S1 A). By contrast, Mg 2+ did not affect activation-induced upregulation of glycolysis in naive CD8 + T cells (defined as CD45RA + and CD62L + ; Figure S1 B). Next, we assessed the dose effect of Mg 2+ in EM CD8 + T cells upon stimulation with anti-CD3 and CD28 mAb, staining for markers of early and late activation (CD69 and CD25, respectively), metabolic adaptation (CD71, CD98), and degranulation (CD107a). These experiments demonstrated a strict Mg 2+ dose response, plateauing at 0.6–1.2 mM, that is, in the physiologic range of plasma concentrations reported for Mg 2+ ( Figure S1 C) ( Akizawa et al., 2008 2.

Association between serum magnesium and anemia: China health and nutrition survey Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 2014; 159 :39-45 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). The difference in the capacity of memory CD8 + T cells to upregulate these phenotypic markers in the presence versus absence of Mg 2+ is summarized in Figure S1 D, left panel . Cytokine release followed the same pattern, with decreased production under Mg 2+ -depleted conditions in EM cells ( Figure S1 D, middle panel ). EM CD8 + T cell viability was not affected by the lack of Mg 2+ in the culture media ( Figure S1 D, right panel ). Analogous to induction of glycolysis, no Mg 2+ -related effect was observed for naive CD8 + T cells for each of these measures ( Figure S1 E, left and middle panels ), and also, in naive cells, viability was not affected by the lack of Mg 2+ in culture media ( Figure S1 E, right panel ). The immediacy with which Mg 2+ affected reactivity of EM CD8 + T cells ( Figure S1 A) suggested the possibility that a Mg 2+ -sensitive target (or targets) expressed on the cell surface could (co-)affect T cell function. Clustering of activated T cell blasts was also reduced in the absence of Mg 2+ , lending further support to the idea that Mg 2+ was impacting a target (or targets) on the cell surface ( Figure S1 F). This notion was also supported by the lack of evidence for rapid Mg 2+ flux into Mg 2+ -deprived CD8 + T cells, which was in contrast to Ca 2+ flux tested in the same setting ( Figure S1 G). Guided by these phenotypic and functional data, we overlaid genes from gene ontology (GO) lists in a Venn diagram, inputting the following terms: metal ion binding (parent term of Mg 2+ binding ), immune synapse (CD3/28 activation), and leukocyte adhesion (clustering experiments), together with a published list of proteins preferentially expressed by EM over naive CD8 + T cells (differential impact of Mg 2+ ) ( van Aalderen et al., 2017 67. van Aalderen, M.C. ∙ van den Biggelaar, M. ∙ Remmerswaal, E.B.M. ... Label-free analysis of CD8+ T cell subset proteomes supports a progressive differentiation model of human-virus-specific T cells Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :1068-1079 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). This approach identified ITGAL (the gene encoding the integrin subunit alpha L chain, CD11a) as a candidate gene plausibly linked to the input criteria ( Figure 1 A). CD11a combines with CD18 to form the leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). LFA-1 is an integrin that is involved in T cell activation via immune synapse formation as well as in leukocyte trafficking and extravasation ( Hogg et al., 2011 23. Hogg, N. ∙ Patzak, I. ∙ Willenbrock, F. The insider's guide to leukocyte integrin signalling and function Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 :416-426 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon TCR stimulation, inside-out signaling mediates LFA-1 conformational changes, which regulate LFA-1 ligand-binding affinity and the molecule's capacity for outside-in signaling. Binding of Mg 2+ to metal-ion-dependent adhesion sites (MIDAS), one each on CD18 and CD11a, impacts these conformational changes. Specifically, MIDAS binding of Mg 2+ modulates the interchain allosteric relay (stalk extension) and external ligand affinity (headpiece conformation) ( Schürpf and Springer, 2011 57. Schürpf, T. ∙ Springer, T.A. Regulation of integrin affinity on cell surfaces EMBO J. 2011; 30 :4712-4727 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Chen, 2012 71. Zhang, K. ∙ Chen, J. The regulation of integrin function by divalent cations Cell Adh. Migr. 2012; 6 :20-29 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). The overall expression of LFA-1, which can be assessed using mAb TS2/4, was lowest on naive CD8 + T cells, higher on EM CD8 + T cells, and highest on T cell blasts ( Figure 1 B). Memory cell-selective Mg 2+ dependency of metabolic reprogramming and activation and Mg 2+ dependency of clustering of T cell blasts thus aligned with the selection of ITGAL in our GO-term integration approach. The molecular conformation of LFA-1 can be probed by staining conformational epitopes. Specifically, KIM127 recognizes extended LFA-1, whereas m24 binds LFA1 when the headpiece is in its open position ( Figure 1 C). These probing antibodies were used to assess how LFA-1 extension and headpiece opening related to activation (i.e., inside-out signaling) across a range of Mg 2+ concentrations in T cell blasts. Cell-surface expression of LFA-1, irrespective of conformation (i.e., mAb TS2/4 staining), was similar in nonactivated and activated cells and independent of Mg 2+ availability ( Figure 1 D, first panel, upper row ). LFA-1 extension (KIM127 binding) was detected on activated cells only and regulated by Mg 2+ ( Figure 1 D, second panel, upper row ). LFA-1 headpiece opening (m24 binding) was likewise detected on activated cells only and also modulated by Mg 2+ ( Figure 1 D, third pane, upper row ). The effect of Mg 2+ on LFA-1 headpiece opening was also observed in primary human CD8 + T cells ( Figure S1 H). In a Mg 2+ -modulated manner, T cell activation further induced proximal and distal signaling activity (focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, respectively) ( Giannoni et al., 2003 18.

Chem. 2003; 278 :36763-36776 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schaller et al., 1994 54. Schaller, M.D. ∙ Hildebrand, J.D. ∙ Shannon, J.D. ...

Biol. 1994; 14 :1680-1688 Crossref Scopus (1133) PubMed Google Scholar ), nutrient (2-NBDG) uptake, TNF production, and expression of CD107a and CD69 ( Figure 1 D, fourth and fifth panels, upper row and lower row ). We then aimed to differentiate whether extension or headpiece opening was the critical event enabling LFA-1 outside-in signaling. To that end, effects of LFA-1 inhibitors (XVA143, BIRT377, and TS1/18) and LFA-1 activators (CBR LFA-1/2 and Mn 2+ ) were tested regarding proximal LFA-1 outside-in signaling (FAK phosphorylation) in activated T cell blasts, both in the presence and absence of Mg 2+ . In the presence of Mg 2+ , XVA143 (allosteric antagonist inhibiting the ligand-binding I domain while stabilizing extended conformation), BIRT377 (allosteric inhibitor stabilizing bent conformation), and the mAb TS1/18 (allosteric inhibitor stabilizing the closed headpiece) all suppressed activation-induced FAK phosphorylation to levels that were observed when Mg 2+ was lacking ( Figure 1 E). Extending LFA-1 with the activating mAb CBR LFA-1/2 in the presence of Mg 2+ increased FAK phosphorylation above the level observed in the presence of Mg 2+ alone, and yet, extension in the absence of Mg 2+ did not increase LFA-1 outside-in signaling ( Figure 1 E). Mn 2+ , which binds both MIDAS, functions as a universal activator of integrins ( Dransfield et al., 1992b 10. Dransfield, I. ∙ Cabañas, C. ∙ Craig, A. ...

The connection between metal ion affinity and ligand affinity in integrin I domains Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774 :1148-1155 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), was largely compensating for the absence of Mg 2+ in terms of FAK phosphorylation ( Figure 1 E). Of note, Mn 2+ did not affect the cell-intrinsic glycolytic or mitochondrial functional capacity of T cell blasts—core metabolic activities that were also similar in presence versus absence of Mg 2+ in the culture media ( Figures S1 I and S1J). From these experiments, we concluded that extension was required but not sufficient to trigger FAK phosphorylation, and that headpiece opening—which was fully dependent on Mg 2+ ( Figure 1 D)—was necessary for FAK phosphorylation to occur. Birt377 stabilizes LFA-1 in its bent state by eliminating the basal interaction between CD11a and CD18 ( Moore et al., 2018 38. Moore, T.I. ∙ Aaron, J. ∙ Chew, T.L. ...

Salas, A. ∙ Shimaoka, M. ∙ Kogan, A.N. ... Rolling adhesion through an extended conformation of integrin alphaLbeta2 and relation to alpha I and beta I-like domain interaction Immunity. 2004; 20 :393-406 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, adding Mn 2+ , which binds to the beta I-MIDAS with high affinity, is expected to extend LFA-1 even in the presence of Birt377 while keeping the headpiece closed—which is indeed what we observed ( Figures 1 F and 1G). In this scenario, the extension of LFA-1 did not drive FAK phosphorylation, corroborating the notion that headpiece opening was a requirement for FAK phosphorylation to be initiated, while extension alone was not sufficient ( Figure 1 H). The same applied to downstream events regulated by LFA-1, namely activation-induced glycolysis and degranulation ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) are the ligands of LFA-1, and high-affinity LFA-1-ICAM interactions promote immune synapse formation. LFA-1 can also interact with ICAMs in cis ( Fan et al., 2016 14. Fan, Z. ∙ McArdle, S. ∙ Marki, A. ... Neutrophil recruitment limited by high-affinity bent β2 integrin binding ligand in cis Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12658 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well in homotypic cell-cell interactions ( Fan et al., 1993 13. Fan, S.T. ∙ Brian, A.A. ∙ Lollo, B.A. ... CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) integrin engagement enhances biosynthesis of early cytokines by activated T cells. Cell Immunol. 1993; 148 :48-59 Google Scholar ; Sabatos et al., 2008 48. Sabatos, C.A. ∙ Doh, J. ∙ Chakravarti, S. ... A synaptic basis for paracrine interleukin-2 signaling during homotypic T cell interaction Immunity. 2008; 29 :238-248 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). To define how ICAM binding contributed to LFA-1 outside-in signaling in the presence or absence of Mg 2+ in our in vitro system, we assessed the surface expression of ICAMs on T cells. On T cell blasts, expression of ICAM-3 was highest, followed by that of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 ( Figure S1 K). Primary human naive CD8 + T cells expressed less ICAM-3 than EM CD8 + T cells; expression of ICAM-3 on EM CD8 + T cells and T cell blasts was similar ( Figure S1 L). We then used blocking antibodies to prevent ICAMs from interacting with LFA-1, both in the presence and absence of Mg 2+ . Blocking of ICAM-3 moderately reduced LFA-1 headpiece opening upon activation of T cell blasts ( Figure S1 M) and decreased the interlinked upregulation of CD69 ( Figure S1 N).
These experiments established Mg 2+ as an important regulator of EM CD8 + T cell function. Mg 2+ was further identified to impact both extension and headpiece opening of LFA-1 on activated T cells, with headpiece opening being critical to outside-in signaling and downstream T cell activation.
Next, we generated NY-ESO-1-specific T cells using a rapid expansion protocol (REP T cells) ( Dudley et al., 2002 11. Dudley, M.E. ∙ Wunderlich, J.R. ∙ Robbins, P.F. ... Cancer regression and autoimmunity in patients after clonal repopulation with antitumor lymphocytes Science. 2002; 298 :850-854 Crossref Scopus (2492) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thomas et al., 2018 63. Thomas, R. ∙ Al-Khadairi, G. ∙ Roelands, J. ... NY-ESO-1 based immunotherapy of cancer: current perspectives Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :947 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). LFA-1 surface expression on human NY-ESO-1-specific REP T cells was as high as on T cell blasts (PHA blasts) ( Figure 2 A). REP T cell killing activity was augmented by Mg 2+ across a spectrum of target peptide (9c) concentrations used for pulsing tumor target cells—most efficiently so at low 9c concentrations ( Figure S2 A). Also in this antigen-specific setting, Mg 2+ was required for LFA-1 headpiece opening, and extension of LFA-1 in the absence of headpiece opening was insufficient to initiate FAK phosphorylation, degranulation, and target cell killing ( Figure 2 B), as well as ERK1/2 as well as c-Jun activity ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Engagement of ERK1/2 and c-Jun through the LFA-1-Mg 2+ regulatory axis was confirmed by immunoblot analyses in both human T cell blasts ( Figures S2 D and S2E), as well as primary human EM CD8 + T cells ( Figure S2 F). We then visually explored immune synapse formation between NY-ESO-1-specific T cells and tumor cells. These experiments identified early antigen-specific LFA-1 headpiece opening at sites of close physical interaction between REP T cells and tumor targets, which was Mg 2+ dependent, Mn 2+ rescuable, and Birt377 sensitive ( Figure 2 C). Phospho-tyrosine signal intensity at REP T cell-target cell interaction sites also mirrored LFA-1 headpiece opening across all conditions ( Figure 2 C). Maturation of the immune synapse is characterized by centrosome polarization and focused delivery of cytolytic granules, two events that the Mg 2+ -LFA-1 axis also contributed to ( Figure 2 D, imaging performed after 35–45 min of REP T cells target cell co-incubation).
To genetically probe the suggested Mg 2+ -LFA-1 regulatory axis, experiments using LFA-1 deficient (LFA-1 −/− ) cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and LFA-1 −/− Jurkat T cells were performed (validation of k.o.; Figure S3 A). First, we repeated metabolic flux analyses using LFA-1 −/− CTLs. These experiments confirmed LFA-1 as the mediator through which Mg 2+ exerted its effect on glycolysis ( Figure 3 A). 2-NBDG (glucose/nutrient) uptake assays—which were complemented with Mn 2+ and BIRT377—also aligned with the metabolic flux studies ( Figure S3 B). TCR stimulation mediates influx of Ca 2+ into the cytosol, where it functions as a second messenger ( Trebak and Kinet, 2019 65. Trebak, M. ∙ Kinet, J.P. Calcium signalling in T cells Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :154-169 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). Depletion of extracellular Mg 2+ blunted early (white bar) as well as sustained (black bar) influx of Ca 2+ in wild-type (WT) OT-I CTLs, a finding phenocopied independently of extracellular Mg 2+ in LFA-1 −/− OT-I CTLs ( Figure 3 B). The same requirement for LFA-1 for both early and late Ca 2+ flux was also observed in WT versus LFA-1 −/− Jurkat cells ( Figure S3 C). As a proxy for early immune synapse-initiated signaling, we further analyzed TCR ligation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, 2 min postactivation using confocal microscopy. In LFA-1 −/− Jurkat T cells, TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly reduced, independently of extracellular Mg 2+ ( Figure S3 D). In WT Jurkat T cells, Mg 2+ restriction had the same effect ( Figure S3 D). Aligning with these genetic data, in anti-CD3 mAb activated T cell blasts, phospho-tyrosine signaling was augmented by Mg 2+ in a BIRT377-sensitive manner, and the absence of Mg 2+ was partially rescued by Mn 2+ ( Figure S3 E). LFA-1 further recruits and amplifies TCR-mediated ERK1/2 signaling at the immune synapse ( Li et al., 2009 33. Li, D. ∙ Molldrem, J.J. ∙ Ma, Q. LFA-1 regulates CD8+T cell activation via T cell receptor-mediated and LFA-1-mediated ERK1/2 signal pathways J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :21001-21010 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Mg 2+ and partially Mn 2+ increased also ERK1/2 activity in CTLs in an LFA-1-dependent manner ( Figure 3 C). Of note, Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ per se did not induce p-ERK1/2 in unstimulated T cells, nor did genetic deletion or LFA-1 negatively affect p-ERK1/2 signaling upon supra-physiologic activation with PMA and ionomycin ( Figure S3 F). We then investigated the impact that the Mg 2+ -LFA-1 system had on more downstream events in activated CTLs. CD69 and degranulation were similarly induced in activated LFA-1 competent and LFA-1 −/− CTL cells; yet, as expected, only in LFA-1 competent cells they were modulated by Mg 2+ , and partially also by Mn 2+ ( Figures 3 D and 3E). Specific cytotoxic activity in contrast—which is a highly coordinated process requiring timed and polarized release of cytotoxic granules—was severely blunted in LFA-1 −/− CTLs, while regulated via LFA-1 in a Mg 2+ dependent, partially Mn 2+ rescuable, and Birt377-sensitive manner in LFA-1 competent counterparts ( Figure 3 F). This suggested that both high-affinity binding of Mn 2+ to the LFA-1 MIDAS and lack of LFA-1 were associated with dysregulated immune cell function, plausibly due to uncoordinated immune synapse formation in both scenarios. Using OVA variant peptides (affinity for OT-I: G4 < H7 < R7), the importance of the Mg 2+ -LFA-1 system in regulating proximal LFA-1-driven signaling (FAK activity), distal LFA-1-impacted signaling (ERK1/2 activity), degranulation, and specific target cell lysis was confirmed across a spectrum of TCR affinities ( Figures 3 G–3J). Notably, only OVA, with its very high affinity for OT-I, triggered limited lysis independently of Mg 2+ and LFA-1 ( Figure 3 J).
Our goal was then to test how genetic deletion of LFA-1 affected T cell function in relation to Mg 2+ abundance in vivo . First, we established a dietary Mg 2+ depletion model. Organismal extracellular magnesium abundance was mapped both during steady state and after 2 weeks of dietary magnesium restriction ( Figure S4 A). Intriguingly, in mice fed a normal diet, extracellular magnesium distribution was heterogeneous between anatomic sites—with serum, lymph nodes, and muscle being magnesium rich, while, relatively speaking, spleen, liver, and, even more pronounced so, subcutaneous fatty tissues were naturally magnesium low ( Figure 4 A). Mg 2+ depletion was readily induced through dietary restriction ( Figure 4 A), and short-term Mg 2 + low diet did not affect the general health status of mice (data not shown), and the body weight was comparable between cohorts ( Figure S4 B). Complete blood counts revealed only small changes in platelet and erythrocyte numbers ( Figure S4 C, left panel ), as well as in hemoglobin levels and erythrocyte volumes ( Figure S4 C, middle panel ). Differential white blood cell counts showed no alterations in Mg 2+ depleted animals ( Figure S4 C, right panel ). Further flow cytometric analyses indicated that Mg 2+ depletion also had no relevant impact on CD8 + T cell frequency, distribution of phenotypic subpopulations, and steady-state expression of the activation marker CD69 ( Figures S4 D–S4F). The percentage distribution of other lymphocyte subpopulations was likewise unaffected ( Figure S4 G). Using this model, LFA-1 WT and LFA-1 −/− mice were then placed on normal diet versus magnesium low diet for 2 weeks and injected with anti-CD3ε F(ab′)2 fragments to polyclonally activate CD8 + T cells ( Figure 4 B). In a strictly LFA-1-dependent manner, mice with normal organismal Mg 2+ abundance increased expression of the activation marker CD69 on CD8 + T cells. By contrast, only modest upregulation of CD69 was detected on CD8 + T cells from LFA-1 −/− mice, irrespective of diet ( Figure 4 C). Next, the impact of Mg 2+ on WT and LFA-1 −/− OT-I T cells was tested in an MC38-OVA (murine colon cancer cell line) model ( Figure 4 D). On day 9 after tumor implantation, that is, when tumors became palpable, WT or LFA-1 −/− OT-I CTLs were adoptively transferred, and tumors were injected every second or third day with either 3 mM MgCl 2 or 3 mM NaCl ( Figure 4 D). Intratumoral (i.t.) Mg 2+ application efficiently increased local Mg 2+ abundance ( Figure S4 H, left panel ). By contrast, Mg 2+ concentrations in draining lymph nodes were variably affected and serum Mg 2+ concentration remained unchanged ( Figure S4 H, middle and right panels ). In this setting, the most efficient control of cancer growth was observed in mice transferred with WT OT-I T cells and supplemented with Mg 2+ i.t. Tumor growth in mice transferred with LFA-1 −/− OT-I T cells was insensitive to i.t. Mg 2+ application and largely identical to the growth seen in mice transferred WT OT-I T cells but injected with NaCl i.t. ( Figure 4 E).
In order to directly monitor the effect of organismal magnesium abundance on the antigen-specific development of cytotoxic activity of memory CD8 + T cells, in vivo killing assays were performed ( Figure 5 A). Antigen-specific clearance of target cells was lower in Mg 2+ -depleted hosts, with cytotoxicity partially rescued by co-injecting magnesium together with target cells ( Figure 5 B). To explore the effect of magnesium on memory CD8 + T cells fighting intracellular infection, a Listeria monocytogenes -OVA (LmOVA) intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was used ( Figure 5 C). Dietary depletion of Mg 2+ reduced the efficiency of memory CD8 + T cell effector function also in this system, with spiking the i.p. bacterial inoculum with Mg 2+ immediately improving bacterial clearance ( Figure 5 D). Of note, no impact of Mg 2+ per se on bacterial viability or growth was observed ( Figure S5 A). In line with these immune control data, the peritoneal abundance of Granzyme B was lower in Mg 2+ -depleted hosts and significantly rescued in mice receiving a Mg 2+ -spiked bacterial inoculum ( Figure 5 E). Notably, the innate cytokine IL-6 followed an inverse pattern, with markedly increased peritoneal and serum concentrations in mice less able to control infection ( Figures 5 F and S5 B)—plausibly reflecting increased innate inflammation due to a higher bacterial burden. Aligning with better immune control, expression of CD107a and CD69 was higher on OVA-specific CD8 + T cells from Mg 2+ competent than from Mg 2+ -depleted mice ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Spiking the bacterial inoculum with Mg 2+ rescued CD8 + T cell reactivity also in this readout by trend ( Figures 5 G and 5H). The proportion of antigen-specific memory CD8 + T cells in the peritoneal cavity was comparable between cohorts, indicating that recruitment of antigen-specific cells to the site of infection was intact in mice fed a Mg 2+ -depleted diet ( Figures S5 C and S5D).
Adoptive transfer experiments in NSG mice demonstrated that Mg 2+ improved cancer-directed effector activity of CTLs in an LFA-1-dependent manner ( Figure 4 E). In immunocompetent mice harboring OVA-specific memory CD8 + T cells (i.e., immunized with OVA), injection of Mg 2+ i.t. likewise improved local control of MC38 tumor growth. Injection of Mg 2+ i.t. in OVA-naive mice did not affect tumor growth, and neither did contralateral i.t. injection of NaCl ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Of note, no clinical signs or symptoms of autoimmunity were observed in Mg 2+ treated mice (data not shown), and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) screening assays returned negative results across cohorts ( Figure S6 A). OVA immunization induces OVA-specific memory T cells, including memory CD8 + T cells that play a key role in tumor rejection ( Enamorado et al., 2017 12. Enamorado, M. ∙ Iborra, S. ∙ Priego, E. ... Enhanced anti-tumour immunity requires the interplay between resident and circulating memory CD8+ T cells Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :16073 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ; Han et al., 2020 20. Han, J. ∙ Khatwani, N. ∙ Searles, T.G. ... Memory CD8+ T cell responses to cancer Semin. Immunol. 2020; 49 :101435 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ), and depletion experiments established that Mg 2+ exerts its effect via CD8 + T cells ( Figure 6 C). Using flow cytometry, we then enumerated and phenotyped tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Notably, the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells was increased in the Mg 2+ -treated group ( Figure 6 D), whereas the abundance of other immune cell subsets was not affected significantly ( Figures S6 B – S6I). Aligning with their increased number, more Mg 2+ -treated CD8 + T cells expressed Ki67 ( Figure 6 E, left panel ). In addition, more Mg 2+ exposed CD8 + T cells contained Granzyme B and expressed the activation marker CD25 ( Figure 6 E, middle and right panels ). Further reflecting increased activation, PD-1 and TIM-3 were also significantly more often (co-)expressed on Mg 2+ -treated CD8 + T cells ( Figure 6 F). Of note, in vitro re-stimulation experiments at day 3 and day 6 post-initiation of i.t. Mg 2+ injections did not find evidence of dysfunction (exhaustion) of CD8 + T cells (data not shown). Since expression of PD-1 was higher on CD8 + T cells isolated from MgCl 2 -treated as compared with NaCl-treated tumors, we next assessed how combining MgCl 2 injection with PD-1 blockade was impacting tumor-directed memory CD8 + T cell function ( Figure 6 G). Tumor control in mice receiving both intratumoral MgCl 2 as well as PD-1 blockade was superior compared with all other treatment regimens, with MgCl 2 alone again improving immune control significantly ( Figure 6 H). Aligning with these tumor growth data, survival of animals injected with MgCl 2 up to day 26 was significantly improved compared with the NaCl-injected control group, both as a sole intervention and when combined with PD-1 blockade ( Figure 6 I). Liposomal packaging might be a translational strategy to deliver Mg 2+ into tumors since liposomes accumulate at sites with leaky vasculature beds ( Franco et al., 2021 15. Franco, M.S. ∙ Gomes, E.R. ∙ Roque, M.C. ... Triggered drug release from liposomes: Exploiting the outer and inner tumor environment Front. Oncol. 2021; 11 :623760 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nakamura et al., 2016 40. Nakamura, Y. ∙ Mochida, A. ∙ Choyke, P.L. ... Nanodrug delivery: Is the enhanced permeability and retention effect sufficient for curing cancer? Bioconjug. Chem. 2016; 27 :2225-2238 Crossref Scopus (757) PubMed Google Scholar ), and i.t. application of MgCl 2 -packed liposomes did replicate the effects induced by solute injections ( Figures 6 J–6L). Encouraged by these data, we tested the effect of i.p. applied liposomes on tumor growth. Specifically, we compared NaCl-loaded versus MgCl 2 -loaded liposomes coupled to PD1 mAb. The concentration of Mg 2+ applied i.p. with liposomal Mg 2+ packaging was controlled for and confirmed to be in a physiologic range ( Figure S6 J). I.p. administration of Mg 2+ -loaded liposomes enhanced tumor control in a manner additive to PD-1 blockade alone ( Figures 6 M–6O).
Blinatumomab has improved the clinical outcome of select B cell malignancies ( Franquiz and Short, 2020 16. Franquiz, M.J. ∙ Short, N.J. Blinatumomab for the treatment of adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: toward a new era of targeted immunotherapy Biologics. 2020; 14 :23-34 PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, hypomagnesemia occurs in 12%–22% of patients treated with Blinatumomab ( Coyle et al., 2020 8. Coyle, L. ∙ Morley, N.J. ∙ Rambaldi, A. ... Open-label, phase 2 study of Blinatumomab as second salvage therapy in adults with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma Leuk. 2020; 61 :2103-2112 Lymphoma Google Scholar ; Kiyoi et al., 2020 27. Kiyoi, H. ∙ Morris, J.D. ∙ Oh, I. ... Phase 1b/2 study of Blinatumomab in Japanese adults with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia Cancer Sci. 2020; 111 :1314-1323 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Topp et al., 2015 64. Topp, M.S. ∙ Gökbuget, N. ∙ Stein, A.S. ...

Blinatumomab-mediated cytotoxicity, when used in its reported therapeutic range (230–620 pg mL −1 ) ( Topp et al., 2015 64. Topp, M.S. ∙ Gökbuget, N. ∙ Stein, A.S. ... Safety and activity of Blinatumomab for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: A multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study Lancet Oncol. 2015; 16 :57-66 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1013) PubMed Google Scholar ), was strongly, and in a dose-dependent manner, dependent on the availability of Mg 2+ ( Figure 7 A). Aligning with the cytotoxicity data, the effect of Blinatumomab on cell clustering ( Figure 7 B), activation-induced LFA-1 headpiece opening ( Figure S7 A), as well as FAK phosphorylation ( Figure S7 B) was likewise Mg 2+ sensitive. Stabilizing the headpiece of LFA-1 in its closed position, using the mAb TS1/18, almost completely abrogated Blinatumomab-mediated cytotoxicity, irrespective of Mg 2+ availability ( Figure 7 C). Inversely, combining Blinatumomab with the LFA-1 extending mAb CBR LFA-1/2 increased target cell killing both in the presence and absence of Mg 2+ ( Figure 7 C).
To explore the relevance of Mg 2+ in the context of CAR T cell therapy, human CD19 or prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting CAR T cells were used ( Neelapu et al., 2017 42. Neelapu, S.S. ∙ Locke, F.L. ∙ Bartlett, N.L. ... Axicabtagene Ciloleucel CAR T-cell therapy in refractory large B-cell lymphoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 377 :2531-2544 Crossref Scopus (3898) PubMed Google Scholar ; Santoro et al., 2015 52. Santoro, S.P. ∙ Kim, S. ∙ Motz, G.T. ... T cells bearing a chimeric antigen receptor against prostate-specific membrane antigen mediate vascular disruption and result in tumor regression Cancer Immunol. Res. 2015; 3 :68-84 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Introducing a CAR did not alter LFA-1 expression ( Figure 7 D) or dependency of these cells on Mg 2+ both with respect to glycolytic reprogramming and phenotypic changes upon conventional activation via ligation of CD3 and CD28 ( Figures S7 C and S7D). We then went on to assess the Mg 2+ dependency of CAR-driven cytotoxicity. In line with our previous findings with REP T cells, the Mg 2+ -LFA-1 regulatory system reproduced in CD19 CAR T cells ( Figure 7 E), and time-lapse killing assays demonstrated that Mg 2+ restriction severely blunted PSMA CAR-specific killing of target cells ( Figure 7 F). Concomitantly, the release of IFN-γ by anti-PSMA CAR T cells was reduced in Mg 2+ -deplete conditions ( Figure 7 G). Tumor rejection and survival were also improved in a model where CAR T cells were adoptively transferred into mice harboring established tumors that were then Mg 2+ enriched by i.t. injections ( Figures 7 H and 7I). We then wanted to test whether dietary Mg 2+ restriction, thus reducing systemic and intratumoral Mg 2+ abundance ( Figures S7 E and S7F), affects CAR T cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( Figure 7 J). Indeed, dietary Mg 2+ restriction was sufficient to negatively impact CAR T cell-mediated tumor rejection ( Figure 7 K). Food intake was comparable between the cohorts, and yet, tumor-bearing mice fed a Mg 2+ -depleted diet had a lower body weight by day 25 of the experiment ( Figures S7 G and S7H), suggestive of a more catabolic state. While the impact of (mild) intratumoral Mg 2+ depletion through dietary restriction was less pronounced than in the opposite experiment where Mg 2+ was injected into the tumors ( Figures 4 E, 6 B, 6C, 6H, 6K, and 7 I), the effect was still clear. This prompted us to retrospectively assess the relationship between serum Mg 2+ levels and clinical outcomes in a CAR T cell trial and in an immune checkpoint inhibitor study. The CAR trial included a cohort of 100 patients with refractory B cell lymphoma treated with CD19-directed CAR T cells (Axicabtagene Ciloleucel), of which four had to be excluded from the retrospective analysis due to incomplete Mg 2+ -serum testing ( Figure S7 I, Study Diagram ). Patients were classified into two strata according to the mean Mg 2+ level between days −5 and +3 of treatment (n = 5 measurements available for each patient). An arbitrary cut-off was set at 1.7 mg dl −1 for assigning patients into normo- versus hypomagnesemia groups (Figure 7L , left panel , and Figure S7 K). Baseline characteristics of these retrospectively assigned study populations were similar, including age, ECOG performance status, and disease stage ( Figure S7 J). Although the number of patients with a mean Mg 2+ level of <1.7 mg dl −1 was low, overall survival and median progression-free survival for these patients were reduced as compared with patients with normal serum Mg 2+ levels (Figure 7L, right panel , and Figure S7 L). We next explored how organismal Mg 2+ abundance was associated with outcome in a cohort of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients enrolled in an immune checkpoint inhibitor trial (SAKK16/14) ( Rothschild et al., 2021 47. Rothschild, S.I. ∙ Zippelius, A. ∙ Eboulet, E.I. ... SAKK 16/14: durvalumab in addition to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIA(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer-a multicenter single-arm phase II trial J. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 39 :2872-2880 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). From a total of 67 initially enrolled patients, two had to be excluded, leaving 65 that were treated with an anti-PD-L1 mAb (Durvalumab) in addition to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( Figure S7 M, study diagram ). Any detection of hypomagnesemia during the course of the trial (n = 2–23 measurements/study participant) assigned an individual to the hypomagnesemia group. This stratification strategy well discriminated the mean Mg 2+ levels across all available measurements ( Figure 7 M, left panel). Also in this clinical trial, baseline characteristics were similar between the two retrospectively assigned groups ( Figure S7 N). Pathological complete response and overall survival ( Figure 7 M, middle and right panels ), as well as radiographic response and event-free survival ( Figures S7 O and S7P), were all reduced in patients with hypomagnesemia. While these retrospective analyses have many limitations, in the context of our experimental data, the findings aligned with the concept that Mg 2+ , by increasing LFA-1 outside-in signaling activity, may contribute to the clinical efficacy of CAR T cells and endogenous cancer-directed T cells in human patients.

Section: Discussion

LFA-1 inside-out signaling, or activation, has previously been shown to modulate T cell function by modifying the molecule co-stimulation activity (i.e., outside-in signaling) ( Gérard et al., 2021 17. Gérard, A. ∙ Cope, A.P. ∙ Kemper, C. ... LFA-1 in T cell priming, differentiation, and effector functions Trends Immunol. 2021; 42 :706-722 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2009 69.

Chem. 2009; 284 :12645-12653 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our experiments now demonstrate that, upon activation of LFA-1, extracellular Mg 2+ increases LFA-1 outside-in signaling in a dose-dependent manner by contributing to extension and headpiece opening. Mg 2+ exerts its effects on the conformation of LFA-1 both by binding to the beta I- and the alpha I-MIDAS, with the precise contribution of the respective interactions yet to be resolved ( Schürpf and Springer, 2011 57.

Small molecule integrin antagonists that bind to the β2 subunit I-like domain and activate signals in one direction and block them in the other Immunity. 2003; 19 :391-402 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Through this activity, extracellular Mg 2+ defines the outcome of memory CD8 + T cell-dependent immunity. Unsurprisingly, also in light of our data, complete pharmacological inhibition of LFA-1 causes severe immunosuppression ( Goodman and Picard, 2012 19. Goodman, S.L. ∙ Picard, M. Integrins as therapeutic targets Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2012; 33 :405-412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is interesting to note that, when using a mAb that stabilizes extended LFA-1 or when transferring T cells expressing constitutively extended LFA-1, T cell responses are severely impaired both in vitro and in vivo ( Dransfield et al., 1992a 9. Dransfield, I. ∙ Cabañas, C. ∙ Barrett, J. ... Interaction of leukocyte integrins with ligand is necessary but not sufficient for function J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116 :1527-1535 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ; Semmrich et al., 2005 58. Semmrich, M. ∙ Smith, A. ∙ Feterowski, C. ... Importance of integrin LFA-1 deactivation for the generation of immune responses J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201 :1987-1998 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). This underscores the complex interconnection between LFA-1’s structural conformation, its outside-in signaling activity, and the function of T cells—a system tuned, as we show here, by Mg 2+ in the extracellular space. In an intricate manner, extracellular Ca 2+ and Mn 2+ coordinate with Mg 2+ in stabilizing beta integrin heterodimer complexes as well as in regulating conformational changes. Specifically, Ca 2+ at physiologic concentrations has an inhibitory effect on integrin-ligand binding, while low Ca 2+ abundance functions synergistically with Mg 2+ in mediating cell adhesion ( Dransfield et al., 1992b 10. Dransfield, I. ∙ Cabañas, C. ∙ Craig, A. ... Divalent cation regulation of the function of the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 J.

Chem. 2000; 275 :24560-24564 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ca 2+ exerts these modulatory effects by binding to two adjacent metal coordination sites flanking the beta I MIDAS, termed Ligand-induced metal-binding site (LIMBS) and adjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) ( Chen et al., 2003 5. Chen, J. ∙ Salas, A. ∙ Springer, T.A. Bistable regulation of integrin adhesiveness by a bipolar metal ion cluster Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10 :995-1001 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mould et al., 2003 39. Mould, A.P. ∙ Barton, S.J. ∙ Askari, J.A. ...

The potent integrin activator Mn 2+ , in contrast, operates by binding MIDAS motifs and by competing with Ca 2+ for LIMBS and ADMIDAS binding ( Chen et al., 2003 5. Chen, J. ∙ Salas, A. ∙ Springer, T.A. Bistable regulation of integrin adhesiveness by a bipolar metal ion cluster Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10 :995-1001 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ; Valdramidou et al., 2008 66. Valdramidou, D. ∙ Humphries, M.J. ∙ Mould, A.P.

Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :32704-32714 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). While our data demonstrate that modifying Mg 2+ in the extracellular space is sufficient to impact T cell effector maturation in vivo , it will be interesting to study how Mg 2+ integrates its function with other divalent cations across physiologic and pathologic concentrations.
The compartmentalized distribution of Mg 2+ in healthy mice plausibly creates tissue-specific differences in the TCR signal strength required to activate memory CD8 + T cells that are engaged in immune surveillance of Mg 2+ high versus Mg 2+ low tissues. It will be of value to explore whether compartment-specific effects on the CD8 + T cell activation threshold not only affect infection control and cancer immune control but also affect the occurrence of autoimmunity.
Improving conventional cancer therapy by manipulating nutrient availability through dietary intervention is a field of growing interest ( Kanarek et al., 2020 25. Kanarek, N. ∙ Petrova, B. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. Dietary modifications for enhanced cancer therapy Nature. 2020; 579 :507-517 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, experimental data suggest beneficial effects of repetitive fasting cycles in mice, the rationale being to target the high metabolic requirements of cancer cells ( Lee et al., 2012 32. Lee, C. ∙ Raffaghello, L. ∙ Brandhorst, S. ... Fasting cycles retard growth of tumors and sensitize a range of cancer cell types to chemotherapy Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :124ra27 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar ). When aiming to translate such deprivation strategies to clinical medicine, they need, however, to be carefully balanced against the danger of imposing nutrient deficiencies that may negatively impact on host immunity. Indeed, only 2 weeks of dietary depletion of Mg 2+ was sufficient to affect both tumor and infection immune control in mice, and low serum Mg 2+ levels were associated with an unfavorable outcome both in CAR T cell and anti-PDL1 mAb-treated human cancer patients. Of note, hypomagnesemia is present in up to a fifth of Blinatumomab-treated individuals ( Kiyoi et al., 2020 27. Kiyoi, H. ∙ Morris, J.D. ∙ Oh, I. ...

Inversely, a recent study in patients with acute myeloid leukemia showed that higher serum magnesium levels after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were associated with a decreased incidence of relapse but with a higher risk of acute graft-versus-host disease ( Angenendt et al., 2021 3. Angenendt, L. ∙ Hilgefort, I. ∙ Mikesch, J.H. ... Magnesium levels and outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in acute myeloid leukemia Ann. Hematol. 2021; 100 :1871-1878 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In conclusion, our data identify extracellular Mg 2+ as an immune modulator, regulating T cell activation via LFA-1 MIDAS binding. LFA-1 thus senses Mg 2+ and integrates its abundance in its co-stimulatory function. Through this axis, Mg 2+ defines the threshold of T cell activation in a subset selective manner.
Autochthonous tumors are more heterogeneous in architecture, immune cell landscape, perfusion, etc., than the cancer models used in this study, and our findings, therefore, cannot be generalized. We also have not analyzed the long-term consequences of enhancing LFA-1 outside-in signaling, which will require slow growth, i.e., more chronic cancer models. Furthermore, how organismal depletion of Mg 2+ affects the efficiency of CAR T cells to attack established solid tumors remains to be defined. It is notable, however, that stratifying human cancer patients according to serum Mg 2+ abundance was discriminating study participants with regard to relevant endpoints in both a CAR T cell- and an immune checkpoint trial. Yet, the retrospective nature of these analyses limits the significance of the associations detected. Therefore, as instructed by our findings, prospective controlled trials will need to clarify the clinical relevance of Mg 2+ as an immunomodulatory agent in cancer medicine.

Primary T cells were obtained from Buffy coats of healthy donors (Blood donor center, University Hospital Basel or Blood donor center Lausanne). Jurkat T cells (Clone E61, TIB-152) and HEK-293T were originally purchased from ATCC. T2, Ramos and EL4 cells were kindly provided by A. Zippelius (University of Basel). MC38-OVA cells were provided to A.M.L. by P. Romero (University of Lausanne). PC3-PIP cell lines were provided to M.I. by A. Rosato (University of Padua, Padova). Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were provided by G. Bantug (University of Basel).
For the culture of primary human CD8 + T cells, PHA-induced T cell blasts, Jurkat T cells, PC3-PIP, Ramos, LCL and T2 cells, RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) was supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (HI FCS, Gibco), 50 U mL -1 penicillin (Invitrogen) and 50 μg mL -1 streptomycin (Invitrogen). Human REP T cells were expanded in AIM V medium (ThermoFisher) mixed 1:1 with RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% human HI AB serum, 50 U mL -1 penicillin (Invitrogen) and 50 μg mL -1 streptomycin, 1 mM pyruvate (Gibco), 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Gibco), 1% GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 3,000 U mL -1 human recombinant IL-2 (Proleukin, Novartis). Murine T cells und EL4 cells were kept in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% HI FCS, 100 U mL -1 penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 0.29 mg mL -1 L-glutamine, 50 μM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). 293T human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% HI FCS, 2 mmol l-glutamine, 100 μg mL -1 penicillin and 100 U mL -1 streptomycin (all purchased from Invitrogen). MC38-OVA cells were maintained in RPMI-1640-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 U mL -1 penicillin and 50 μg mL -1 streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 μM 2-Mercaptoethanol and under geneticin selection (0.4 mg mL -1 G418). All reagents were purchased from Gibco. Magnesium-free medium was made in-house, using double distilled water supplemented according to manufacturer’s instruction with RPMI-1640 amino acid solution (Sigma Aldrich), RPMI-1640 vitamin solution (Sigma Aldrich), 1% GlutaMAX (Gibco), 25 mM HEPES (Gibco), 2 g L -1 sodium bicarbonate (Sigma Aldrich), 2g L -1 glucose (Sigma Aldrich), 100 mg L -1 calcium nitrate (Sigma Aldrich), 400 mg L -1 potassium chloride (Sigma Aldrich), 6 g L -1 sodium chloride (Sigma Aldrich), 800 mg L -1 sodium phosphate dibasic (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mg L -1 Glutathion (Sigma Aldrich), 50 U m -1 penicillin and 50 μg mL -1 streptomycin and 10% HI dialyzed FCS (dFCS, Gibco). For functional readouts, the medium was either supplemented, as indicated, with 1.2 mM MgCl 2 or 0.05 mM MnCl 2 or left untreated (=0 mM Mg 2+ ). Cells of every condition were washed initially twice in magnesium-free medium prior to any functional read out. Low background Mg 2+ values in self-made medium was verified by ICP-MS (data not shown).
Information on sex and age of the mice used in each experimental setting can be found in the corresponding section. C57BL/6NRj, C57BL/6NCrl and NOD.Cg-Prkdc<scid>Il2rg<tm1Wjl>SzJ (NSG) mice were bred and housed at specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions at the Universities of Basel or Lausanne. MHC class I-restricted OVA-specific T cell receptor (B6.129S6-Rag2tm1Fwa Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb) (OT-I) transgenic, B6.129S7-Itgaltm1Bll/J (LFA-1 KO) were originally purchased from Taconic (OT-I) or Jackson Laboratories (LFA-1 KO), and thereafter bred and housed at SPF conditions at the University of Basel. For some experiments, C57BL/6NCrl were purchased from Charles River as well as Janvier, and maintained at SPF conditions and acclimatized for 1 week prior to experiments at the animal facilities of the Universities of Geneva or Basel, respectively. Anti-CD19 CAR T cell experiments were conducted with NSG mice at the University of Basel. Anti-PSMA CAR T cell experiments were conducted with NSG mice which were bred and housed in a specific and opportunistic pathogen-free animal facility in the Oncology Department of the University of Lausanne. All experiments were conducted in accordance to the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office guidelines and were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office (Canton of Basel-Stadt, Vaud and Geneva). All cages provided free access to food and water. During experimentation, all animals were monitored at least every other day for signs of distress and, if required, body weight was measured three times a week. Mice were sacrificed at the endpoint by carbon dioxide overdose.
The retrospective analysis of B cell lymphoma cohort treated with Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Axi-cel) was approved by the Institutional Review Board of MD Anderson Cancer Center and conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All included patients provided written informed consent. The SAKK16/14 trial (NCT02572843) was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of each participating site. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
LFA-1 inhibitor studies were performed using BIRT377 (Tocris) and XVA143 (Roche). Both inhibitors were used at 10 μM. TCR independent activation of T cells were conducted with PMA (50 ng mL -1 ; Sigma Aldrich) and ionomycin (1 μg mL -1 ; Sigma Aldrich). All chemicals were aliquoted in DMSO and stored at -20°C until further use.
Either a BD Fortessa LSR II (BD Bioscience), Cytek Aurora (Cytek Biosciences) or Cytoflex S (Beckmann) flow cytometer were used for flow cytometry. For analysis of surface markers, T cells were harvested at indicated time points after activation in vitro , washed once in cold PBS and, if required, stained with Fixable Viability Dyes for 15 min at 4°C. Surface markers were stained with appropriate antibodies for 20 min at 4°C. For stainings of cell suspension from murine organs, cells were additionally pre-incubated with anti-mouse Fc block 10 μg mL -1 (anti-CD16/CD32, BioXCell). For intracellular TNF staining, cells were activated for 4 h. During the final 2 h of activation, cells were treated either with brefeldin A solution (BioLegend) to block cytokine secretion. Cells were then washed and fixed for 20 min at RT (fixation/permeabilization solution, BD Biosciences) and washed with permeabilization buffer (BD Biosciences) prior to staining for 45 min and further washing before acquisition. For analysis of protein phosphorylation, T cells were stimulated as indicated and stained as previously described ( Krutzik and Nolan, 2003 28. Krutzik, P.O. ∙ Nolan, G.P. Intracellular phospho-protein staining techniques for flow cytometry: Monitoring single cell signaling events Cytometry A. 2003; 55 :61-70 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, for assessment of phosphorylation of ERK1/2, c-Jun and FAK, T cells were activated for 45 min either by CD3/28 Ab, antigen-pulsed target cells or PMA/Ionomycin. Cells were fixed by adding 8% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Thermo Fisher) directly into the culture medium to obtain a final concentration of 4% PFA. Cells were incubated for 15 min at RT, washed with FACS buffer, followed by permeabilization with ice cold methanol at 4°C for 5 min. After washing with FACS buffer, cells were stained at room temperature for 30 min, washed and acquired. For evaluation of activation-induced LFA-1 conformation, T cells were cultured in respective medium for 45 min ± activation (CD3/28 Ab or antigen-pulsed target cells). For probing of open headpiece anti-human CD11a/CD18 (clone m24) was directly added to the medium and incubated for 15 min at 37°C followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. Cells were then washed twice in FACS Buffer and fixed in 2% PFA, incubated at room temperature for 20 min and washed with FACS Buffer before acquisition. For assessment of LFA-1 extension, the anti-human CD18 (clone KIM127) was used. The cells were activated for 45 min, fixed directly in medium with PFA at a final concentration of 2%, washed and then incubated with KIM127. For 2-NBDG uptake assays, previously activated T cells were co-incubated for last 45 min of experiment directly with a final concentration of 20 μM 2-NBDG (Abcam). Cells were washed twice in FACS buffer before acquisition. The following antibodies were used:

Blood samples were obtained from healthy male and female donors (18–65 years old) as buffy coats after written informed consent (Blood donor center, University Hospital Basel). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by standard density-gradient centrifugation protocols (Lymphoprep; Fresenius Kabi). MACS beads and LS columns (both Milteny Biotec) were used to sort CD8 + positive T cells. The positively selected CD8 + T cells were incubated with APC anti-CD62L mAb (ImmunoTools) and Pacific Blue anti-CD45RA (Beckman Coulter). Naïve and EM CD8 + T cells were identified as CD62L + CD45RA + and CD62L – CD45RA – populations, respectively. Cell sorting was performed using a BD FACSAria III or BD influx cell sorter (BD Bioscience). Cells were rested for 24 h at 37°C prior to further experiments.
A Seahorse XF-96e extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Agilent) was used to determine the metabolic profile of cells. T cells were plated (2×10 5 cells/well) onto Celltak (Corning, USA) coated cell plates. Experiments were carried out in unbuffered, serum- and Mg 2+ -free self-made medium. Medium was reconstituted with 1.2 mM MgCl 2 or 0.05 mM MnCl 2 as indicated in individual experiments. Reconstitution of cations was either present from beginning of experiment or applied onto plated cells via the instrument’s multi-injection port. All following concentration represent final well concentrations of indicated substance. Human T cells were activated by injection anti-CD3 Ab (1 μg mL -1 ) and anti-CD28 Ab (10 μg mL -1 ). Murine T cells were activated by injection anti-CD3 Ab (5 μg mL -1 ) and anti-CD28 Ab (2.5 μg mL -1 ). Glycolytic activity was quantified by subtracting maximal ECAR from baseline ECAR-measurements. Mitochondrial perturbation experiments were carried out by sequential addition of oligomycin (1 μM, Sigma Aldrich), FCCP (2 μM, Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, Sigma Aldrich), and rotenone (1 μM, Sigma Aldrich). Glycolysis stress test was performed in medium as described above but devoid of glucose. Sequential injections of glucose (10 mM, Sigma Aldrich), oligomycin (1 μM) and 2-deoxy-glucose (50 mM, Sigma Aldrich). Oxygen consumption rates (OCR, pmol/min) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR, mpH/min) were monitored in real time after injection of each compound.
Naïve and EM CD8 + T cells were washed and incubated in Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ free medium for 1 h, followed by loading with MagFluo4 (Thermo Fisher) or Fluo4 (Thermo Fisher) and FuraRed (Thermo Fisher) at a final concentration of 2 μM, in Mg 2+ - or Ca 2+ -free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Thermo Fisher) for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were washed twice in DPBS, and 0.5–1×10 6 cells were acquired using an AccuriC6 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The buffer was reconstituted with 3 mM MgCl 2 or 3 mM CaCl 2 at the indicated time points.
PBMCs were obtained as described above and activated with 10 μg mL -1 Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, Thermo Fisher) and 300 U mL -1 human recombinant IL-2 (Proleukin, Novartis). PHA blasts were expanded by adding fresh IL-2 every 3-4 days.
Unless stated otherwise, human EM CD8 + T cells and PHA blasts were activated in presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 Ab (HIT3a, BioLegend) at 1 μg mL -1 and soluble anti-CD28 Ab (CD28.2, BioLegend) at 5 μg mL -1 . Naïve CD8 + T cells were activated with in-house generated anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated microbeads. Polybead microspheres (4.5 mm, Polyscience Eppenheim) were incubated with 1 μg anti-CD3 Ab and 10 μg anti-CD28 Ab. T cells were plated at 2×10 5 cells per well in flat bottom 96 well plates (Greiner Bio One) in self-made medium supplemented with 10% dFCS and indicated supplementation of cations or LFA-1 inhibitor. For analysis of surface markers, primary human T cells were activated for 24 h, PHA blasts for 4 h. For phospho-flow and LFA-1 conformational states, T cells were activated for 45 min. When using inhibitory or activating antibodies or chemical LFA-1 inhibitors, T cells were pre-incubated with respective treatment for 20 min before activation.

PHA blasts were pre-incubated with respective anti-ICAM or isotype control antibody (anti-ICAM-1, clone HA58 ; anti-ICAM-2, clone CBR-IC2/2 ; anti-ICAM-3 clone CBR-IC3/1 and matching isotype control, all from Thermo Fisher) at a concentration of 10 μg mL -1 for 20 min at room temperature prior to activation.
NY-ESO-9c peptide (SLLMWITQC) was purchased in >95% purity from EZ Biolabs. Lyophilized peptides were resuspended at 10 mM in sterile dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -20°C until further use.
The lentiviral construct encoding for the codon-optimized WT LAU155 NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor α and β chains under an hPGK promotor separated by an IRES domain was kindly provided to M.P.T. by M. Hebeisen and N. Rufer at the University of Lausanne ( Hebeisen et al., 2013 21. Hebeisen, M. ∙ Oberle, S.G. ∙ Presotto, D. ...

To generate lentivirus, 2.5×10 6 low passage HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Thermo Fisher) and seeded into a 15 cm tissue-culture treated dish. After 3 days, 2 nd generation LTR-containing donor plasmid, packaging plasmid pCMV-delta8.9 and the envelope plasmid VSV-G were mixed at a 4:2:1 ratio in non-supplemented Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher) and sterile filtered. This solution was then mixed with polyethyleneimine 25 kDa (Polysciences Inc.), also diluted in Opti-MEM at a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:3. 28 μg of DNA was transfected per 15 cm dish. After 2 days, supernatants were collected from cells (exchange medium) and filtered through a 0.45 μm PES filter. Supernatants were stored for 1 day at 4°C until the second batch of supernatant was collected 24 h later. The supernatant containing lentiviral particles was concentrated by ultra-centrifugation at 40,000 x g for 2 h at 4°C, resuspended in 0.1% BSA in PBS, and frozen to -80°C until further use.
To generate NY-ESO-1 TCR specific T cells, human healthy donor PBMC were thawed and washed in PBS. CD8 + T cells were then isolated using the CD8 + microbeads (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on an AutoMACS (Myltenyi). Isolated cells were washed and resuspended in medium supplemented with 150 U mL -1 IL-2 and plated at 1.5 mio mL -1 . CD8 + T cells were then activated at a 1:1 ratio with activation beads from T cell activation and expansion kit (Miltenyi) according to manufacturer’s instructions. 24 h later, NY-ESO-1 TCR lentiviral particles, produced as described above, were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. Cells were then expanded every 2 days with fresh medium and replenishing 50 UmL -1 IL-2 for 5 days. NY-ESO-1 TCR positive T cells were sorted using a FACSAria III or FACS SorpAria (BD) and re-stimulated with NY-ESO-9c peptide. A cell density of 0.5–2×10 6 cells mL -1 was maintained for expansion and 3,000 U mL -1 IL-2 replaced ever third day. After 1 week of expansion, cells were either stored in liquid nitrogen or further expanded and subsequently used for functional read outs as described below.
REP T cells were incubated with T2 target cells in flat bottom 96 well-plate at a 1:1 ratio (4-6×10 4 each). In order to distinguish the different cell populations, REP T cells were labeled with CTV and T2 target cells with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimydyl ester (CFSE, Invitrogen) or CFTR (Invitrogen). Prior to co-incubation, T2 target cells were pulsed with NY-ESO-9c peptide at 10 -8 M for 30 min in magnesium-free medium before being washed and re-suspended with REP T cells in magnesium-free medium supplemented with 10% dFCS at indicated cation or LFA-1 inhibitor concentration. For all co-incubation experiments, cells were allowed to sediment without centrifugation. For analysis of protein phosphorylation, co-incubation was terminated after 25 min as described above. In these experiments, Mn 2+ concentration was 0.5 mM instead of 0.05 mM as in all other experiments. For degranulation assays, an anti-CD107a-AF647 Ab was added directly into culture medium throughout the entire co-incubation. After 4 h, cells were harvested, washed in cold FACS Buffer and gently fixed with PFA 2% for 15 min at room temperature. Cytotoxicity was examined with NucView 488 fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate (Biotium). Fluorogenic caspase substrate was added to wells at the beginning of co-incubation at final concentration of 1 μM. After 45 min, cells were washed in FACS Buffer and gently fixed with PFA 2% for 15 min at room temperature.
Pictures from immunofluorescence imaging were recorded on a Nikon Ti with a Yokogawa CSU-W2 spinning disk module on a Photometrics 95B (22 mm back-illuminated sCMOS) camera. A Nikon CFI Apo Lambda 60x objective or Nikon CFI Apo TIRF NA 1.49 100x objective was used with 1.515 oil mounted samples. Diode-pumped solid-state lasers at 405, 488, 561, and 647nm were used together with filters for DAPI (ET460/50nm), AF488 (ET525/50nm), AF555 (ET630/75nm) and AF647 (ET700/75nm) with a Quad BS Dichroic mirror. If required, raw nd2 format image stacks were deconvoluted using Huygens using a theoretical point spread function classical maximum likelihood estimation using 100 iterations and a quality stop criterion of 0.05.
REP T cells and T2 target cells were individually labeled with CTV or CFSE. T2 cells were loaded with 10 -7 M NY-ESO-9c peptide for 30 min. T2 and REP T cells were washed three times in serum- and Mg 2+ -free medium, mixed 1:1 and resuspended to a final concentration of 2.5×10 6 cells mL -1 . Cell suspension was incubated 5 min at RT, before aliquoting in 50 μl onto glass multi-well slides (Thermo Fisher) and incubating for indicated time. Cell conjugates were fixed for 20 min at RT in 4% methanol-free PFA (Sigma Aldrich), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 5 min and quenched with 50 mM Glycine (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 20 min. Fixation was followed by blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS (blocking buffer) for 45 min at 4°C. Primary antibodies were then incubated in the same blocking buffer for 1 h at RT or overnight at 4°C. Samples were then washed four times with blocking buffer, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were then mounted with Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed after 24 h of curing. Of note, for visualization of LFA-1 with open head-piece, m24 antibody was added directly in multi-well slides for the last 10 min of co-incubation. Cells were fixed after 10–25 min for m24 and pan-phospho staining and and 35–45 min for perforin and centrosome staining. The following reagents and antibodies were used for staining: CD11a/CD18 (clone m24, BioLegend), gamma Tubulin (clone EPR16793, Abcam), perforin (clone δG9, BD Bioscience), phospho-tyrosine P-Tyr-1000 (#8954S, Cell Signaling Technology), secondary goat anti-mouse (AF568, Thermo Fisher), secondary goat anti-rabbit (AF647, Thermo Fisher).
For analysis of open head-piece LFA-1 and pan phospho-tyrosine intensity in REP T cells, confocal Z -stacks were acquired and analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane). REP T cell volumes were identified using the surface -tool: source channel 4 (DAPI=CTV), 5 μm diameter cut-off with 0.369 μm surface detail and > 1689 voxels. Fluorescent signal of source channel 3 (AF555=LFA-1 m24 staining) outside of REP T cell-surface was masked and extended LFA-1 was quantified with surface -tool: source channel 5 (masked AF555), 1.39 μm diameter cut-off with 0.369 μm surface detail and > 154 voxels. Number of LFA-1 m24-objects were normalized to REP T cell number per field of view. Pan phospho-tyrosine intensity was determined by plotting median intensity of source channel 2 (AF647) per REP T cell volume identified as described above. For analysis of perforin and centrosome polarization, position of REP T and T2 target cells in confocal Z -stacks were characterized with spot -tool: Source channel 1 (AF488=CFSE) with the following parameters 10 μm estimated diameter and spot classification with quality threshold > 27.4 was used to identify T2 target cells and source channel 4 (DAPI=CTV) with 8 μm estimated diameter and spot classification with quality threshold > 37.8, for REP T cells respectively. For detection of centrosome and perforin granules in REP T cells surface -tool was applied on source channel 4 (DAPI=CTV), 5 μm diameter cut-off of with 0.369 μm surface detail and > 2014 voxel cut-off. Fluorescent signal of source channel 1 (AF488=perforin) and source channel 2 (AF647=centrosome) outside of defined REP T cell surface was masked and positions of respective objects were identified with spot -tool: 0.8 μm estimated diameter and spot classification with quality threshold > 1365 for perforin and 1.84 μm estimated diameter and spot classification with quality threshold > 637 for centrosome. X, Y, Z values of each individual spot (cells, perforin granule and centrosome) were subjected to further analysis using script in R. For each spot we identified its parent T cell and for each T cell its nearest tumor cell using the RANN package. T cell-cancer cell interactions were considered if their centers were between 3 and 25 μm apart, which reduces distant non-interacting cells and artefacts. Then the spot-to-cancer-cell distance was divided by the cell-to-cell distance to calculate the polarization ratio for each interaction pair. Median polarization ratios between conditions and field of views were compared in Graphpad Prism.
Activated memory T cells and PHA blasts were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher) containing protease- and phosphatase-inhibitors (Roche, #05 892 970 001 and #04 906 837 001), and protein concentrations determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Whole-cell lysates were denatured with 4× Laemmli buffer and separated by 4%–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Biorad). Membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies: P-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Thr202/Tyr204, #D13.14.4E, Cell Signaling Technology), P-c-Jun (S73, #D47G9, Cell Signaling Technology), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, #137F5, Cell Signaling Technology), c-Jun (#60A8, Cell Signaling Technology) and Actin (#8H10D10, Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were then stained with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (both from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) secondary antibodies. SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and ChemiDoc Imaging System (Biorad) were used for detection and FiJi software for quantification.
Single cell suspensions were made from lymph nodes and spleens harvested from OT-I mice (male and female, 6-10 weeks, equal distribution of sex and age). 2×10 6 mL -1 OT-I lymphocytes were resuspended in medium containing 100 ng mL -1 OVA 257–264 peptide (Eurogentec) and 100 U mL -1 of IL-2 (Proleukin) and incubated for 48 h. OT-I cells were nucleofected with the P4 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza) according to manufacturer’s instructions using 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza). Briefly, 1×10 7 activated OT-I T cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector Solution and combined with RNP solution. crRNAs were selected from predesigned CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs Tool from IDT. Product ID and sequences are listed in Table S1 . Per reaction, 900 pmol crRNA (IDT) or 900 pmol negative control crRNA #1 (IDT) were mixed with 900 pmol trRNA (IDT) in nuclease-free duplex buffer (IDT), annealed at 95°C for 5 min and added to 300 pmol μM Cas9 (QB3 MacroLab, UC Berkeley) followed by incubation at room temperature for at least 10 min. An appropriate nucleofector program was applied. OT-I lymphocytes were rested in Mouse T Cell Nucleofector Medium (Lonza) for 12 h and then washed and seeded in fresh medium at 10 6 mL -1 in round bottom 96 well-plates with 500 U mL -1 IL-2. Fresh IL-2 was added on a daily basis. Knock-out efficiency was validated by flow cytometry and purified by cell sorting.
Jurkat T cells were nucleofected using the AMAXA cell line V nucleofection kit (Lonza) according to manufacturer’s instructions using 2b Nucleofector (Lonza). Briefly, 1×10 6 Jurkat T cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector Solution and combined with RNP solution. crRNAs were selected from predesigned CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs Tool from IDT. Product ID and sequences are listed in Table S1 . crRNA (IDT) or negative control crRNA #1 (IDT) and trRNA (IDT) were mixed at a 1:1 ratio to a final concentration of 50 μM in nuclease-free duplex buffer (IDT), annealed at 95°C for 5 min and added to 40 μM Cas9 (QB3 MacroLab, UC Berkeley) followed by incubation at room temperature for at least 10 min. An appropriate nucleofector program was applied. Knock-out efficiency was validated by flow cytometry and purified by cell sorting. Jurkat T cells were initially expanded for 1 week and then stored in liquid nitrogen until further use.
Murine OT-I CTLs were loaded with Calbryte 520 AM (AAT Bioquest) and Jurkat T cells were loaded with Fluo4 (Thermo Fisher). Both calcium indicator dyes were used at a final concentration of 2 μM in Mg 2+ -free self-made medium for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed twice and plated at 5×10 5 per well (OT-I CTLs) and 2×10 5 per well (Jurkat T cells) in a black flat bottom 96 well-plate (Greiner BIO-one) which had been precoated with Poly-D-Lysine (Gibco) in case of OT-I CTLs or collagen (Thermo Fisher) for Jurkat T cell respectively. An additional incubation for 15 min at 37°C allowed cells to adhere and Fluo4 probe to de-esterified completely. OT-I CTLs were stimulated with 10 μM OVA 257–264 peptide (SIINFEKL, Eurogentec) and Jurkat T cells with 10 μg mL -1 anti-CD3. Fluorescence intensity over time was measure with a Tecan Spark M10 plate reader. The mean of fluorescent signal intensity was normalized to unstimulated baseline values.
Single cell suspensions were made from lymph nodes and spleens harvested from C57BL/6 and LFA-1 KO mice (male and female, 6–10 weeks, equal distribution of sex and age). Naïve CD8 + T cells were isolated using a magnetic bead-based negative selection kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations (easySEP, Stem Cell Technologies). Naïve T cells (2×10 5 per well) were plated in presence of 5 μg anti-CD3 Ab (plate-bound) and 1μg anti-CD28 Ab (soluble; both from BioLegend) for 2 days in presence 100 U mL -1 of IL-2 (Proleukin). Cells were washed and seeded in fresh medium at 10 6 mL -1 in round bottom 96 well-plates with 500 U mL -1 IL-2. A cell density of 0.5–2 × 10 6 cells mL -1 was maintained for expansion and IL-2 was replaced on a daily basis. Functional read outs were carried out 7-19 days after initial activation and in the absence of IL-2.
CTLs of WT (C57BL/6) or LFA-1 KO were activated for with plate-bound anti-CD3 Ab (145-2C11, BioLegend) at 0.05 μg mL -1 and soluble anti-CD28 Ab (37.51, BioLegend) at 1 μg mL -1 at 2×10 5 cells per well in a flat bottom 96 well plate. For stainings of surface activation markers, CTLs were activated for 8 h and for evaluation of 2-NBDG uptake, cells were activated for 6 h. For analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, CTLs were stimulated with 5 μg mL -1 anti-CD3 Ab and 1 μg mL -1 anti-CD28 for 20 min prior to fixation and permeabilization. For cytotoxicity assays with WT or LFA-1 KO derived CTLs, cytotoxicity was evaluated with NucView 488 fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate (Biotium). Prior to co-incubation, CTLs were labeled with CellTrace Violet (CTV, Invitrogen) and EL4 target cells with CellTrace Far Red (CFTR, Invitrogen). Both cell population were then co-incubated at a CTL-target cell ratio of 3:1 (1.5×10 5 CTLs and 5×10 4 EL4 target cells) in presence of 10 μg mL -1 PHA for 4 h in a flat bottom 96 well plate. Caspase-3 substrate was added for final 45 min of incubation at final concentration of 1 μM. Cells were harvested, washed in FACS Buffer and fixed with PFA 2% for 15 min at RT prior to analysis by FACS. For cytotoxicity assays with OT-I derived CTLs were labeled with CTV, EL4 target cells were labeled with CFTR and pulsed with OVA 257–264 peptide (SIINFEKL, Eurogentec) or the altered peptide ligands R7 (SIIQFERL, Eurogentec), H7 (SIIQFEHL, Eurogentec) or G4 (SIIGFEKL, Eurogentec) at 1 μM for 30 min. EL4 target cells were washed 3 times prior to co-incubation at a CTL-target cell ratio of 3:1 (1.5×10 5 CTLs and 5×10 4 EL4 target cells) in a flat bottom 96 well plate for 4h. Cytotoxicity was quantified with CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher) as described above.
Cells were activated on species-appropriate anti-CD3-coated (1 μg mL -1 ) glass-coverslips (Thermo Fisher) for 2 min for phosphor-tyrosine analysist. Cell conjugates were fixed for 20 min at RT in 4% methanol-free PFA (Sigma Aldrich), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 5 min and quenched with 50 mM Glycine (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 20 min. Fixation was followed by blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS (blocking buffer) for 45 min at 4°C. Primary antibodies were then incubated in the same blocking buffer for 1 h at RT or overnight at 4°C. Samples were then washed four times with blocking buffer, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were then mounted with Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed after 24 h of curing time at RT. The following reagents and antibodies were used for staining: phospho-tyrosine P-Tyr-1000 (multiple monoclonal antibodies, unlabeled, Cell Signaling Technology), secondary goat anti-rabbit (AF647, Thermo Fisher), Phalloidin-iFluor (AF555, Abcam) and DAPI (Sigma Aldrich).
For measurement of pan-phospho tyrosine signal intensity, FiJi software was used. Series of confocal Z-stacks were displayed as maximum intensity z-projections using Z project - tool. Individual cells were selected manually with freehand selection -tool according to cell boundaries indicated by phalloidin staining and fluorescent intensity was measured accordingly with measure -tool.
Magnesium-restricted diet and matching control diet, based on the purified ingredient rodent diet AIN-76A , were purchased at Research Diets Inc. (USA).
Healthy C57BL/6NRj mice (male and female, 6-10 weeks, groups were sex and age adjusted) were kept on magnesium-restricted diet or corresponding control diet for 2 weeks. At day 14, liver, spleen and peripheral lymph nodes, muscle (musculus quadriceps femoris) and subcutaneous fat (flank) were aseptically removed. Organs were weighed, 50-300 ul PBS added (adjusted according to weight), and gently centrifuged at 300 x g for 8 min at 4°C. Organ supernatants were recovered and stored at -80°C. Peritoneal fluid was harvested upon injection if 10 mL sterile PBS into peritoneal cavity; peritoneum was gently massaged and then aseptically opened by incision and lavage was collected. Tumor interstitial fluid of MC38-OVA tumors were collected 1 h after intratumoral injection of either 50 μl 3 mM MgCl 2 or 50 μl 3 mM NaCl. Tumors were aseptically excised, weighed and supernatant was recovered as described above. Tissue interstitial fluid of tumors from in vivo CAR T cell experiments were collected from UTD and saline control mice reaching ethically acceptable end point. Tumors were aseptically excised, weighed and supernatant was recovered as described above.
Samples of varying volumes (serum 5 μl; Muscle 10 μl; liver, lymph node, peritoneal fluid, subcutaneous fat and tumor 25 μl; spleen 50 μl) were added to 200 μl 67-69% HNO 3 (VWR Chemicals; NORMATOM® grade; LOT 1119100) and incubated at 95°C for 2 h. Digestates were filled up to 5 mL volume using ultra-pure H 2 O (<18mΩ; Merckmillipore, 115333) and stored at 4°C. Samples were analyzed using triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (qqq-ICP-MS) on an 8800 system (Agilent, Basel, Switzerland), using general-purpose operational settings. The system was operated in single quad mode using helium as collision gas and quantification done on 24 Mg + . To account for matrix effects, 103 Rh was used as the internal standard. Organ Mg 2+ levels were normalized to tissue weight.
Blood samples (70uL) were harvested in EDTA-coated tubes and diluted with 210uL NaCl 0.9%. Samples were run on the ADVIA 2120i hematology analyzer (Siemens) and analyzed by the multi-species program.
Healthy C57BL/6NRj and LFA-1 KO mice (male and female, 6–10 weeks, groups were sex and age adjusted) were put on AIN76A magnesium-restricted or control diet for two weeks. On day 14, each mouse received 0.5 μg anti-CD3ε F(ab′)2 fragment (BioXCell) per i.v. tail-vein injection. After 6 h, spleens were harvested splenocyte suspensions were analyzed by flow-cytometry.
C57BL/6NRj mice (male and female, 6-10 weeks, groups were sex and age adjusted) were immunized against OVA at day -19. In a first experiment, mice were immunized s.c. with 100 μg OVA protein (Invivogen) and 50 μg of CpG-B (Invivogen). In a second experiment, mice were immunized i.v. with 5×10 3 CFU LmOVA. On day 0, mice were put on magnesium-restricted or control diet for two weeks. On day 14, target splenocytes were harvested from naïve, syngeneic mice and either loaded with OVA 257–264 peptide (Eurogentec) or left untreated. Unloaded control splenocytes were labeled brightly with 2.50 μM CTV (CTV bright ) and OVA 257-264 -loaded splenocytes dimly with 0.25 μM CTV (CTV dim ). Cells were then counted, mixed at 1:1 ratio in PBS, and 2-4×10 6 total target splenocytes were injected i.v. into pre-immunized and naive control mice. Additionally, 200 μl of 3 mM MgCl 2 and 200 μl of 3 mM NaCl were administered i.p., respectively. After 12 h, spleens were harvested and splenocyte suspensions were analyzed by flow-cytometry. Percentages of specific in vivo killing were calculated as [1-(% CTV dim naive / % CTV bright naive) / (% CTV dim immunized / % CTV bright immunized)]×100.
C57BL/6NRj mice (male and female, 6-10 weeks, groups were sex and age adjusted) were immunized i.p. with 5×10 4 CFU Listeria monocytogenes expressing the OVA-peptide ( Listeria monocytogenes expressing chicken Ovalbumin (AA134–387) originally gifted from Prof. Ed Palmer, University of Basel). After 19 days, mice were put on Mg 2+ -restricted or matching control diet for 2 weeks. Mice were then re-infected i.p. with 5×10 5 CFU LmOVA. Bacterial inoculum was either spiked with 3 mM MgCl 2 or 3 mM NaCl diluted in 200 μl ddH 2 O. Mice were sacrificed 12 h post infection and peritoneal fluid was harvested. Peritoneal fluid was harvested upon injection if 10 mL sterile PBS into peritoneal cavity; peritoneum was gently massaged and then aseptically opened by incision and lavage was collected. Peritoneal fluid was then plated on BHI agar-plates and colonies counted upon 24 h of incubation. Remaining peritoneal fluid were centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min and supernatant recovered. Peritoneal fluid and sera were frozen at -80°C prior to further analysis. For flow cytometric analysis of memory CD8 + T cell compartment, mice were scarified 20 h post infection, and peritoneal fluid was harvested. MACS beads and LS columns (both Milteny Biotec) were used to enrich cell suspension for CD8 + T cells. Cells were stained as described above and analyzed by FACS.
Cytokine concentrations in cell culture supernatants, peritoneal fluids and serum were determined using the LegendPlex cytrometric bead array (CBA) Th1-Pannel (human and mouse, both from Biolegend) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Perforin concentrations in peritoneal fluids were determined using ProQuantumMouse Granzyme B Immunoassay Kit (Inivtrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Unless stated otherwise, C57BL/6NCrl (female, 6 to 12 weeks old) were used for experiments. In assays with pre-immunized mice, mice were immunized 19 days before tumor implantation by subcutaneous injection of 100 μg of OVA protein (Invivogen) and 50 μg of CpG-B ODN 1826 (Eurogentec), resuspended in 100 μL of PBS. For tumor implantation, mice were inoculated subcutaneously onto the flanks with 0.5×10 6 MC38-OVA cells, resuspended in 100 μL of PBS. In bilateral tumor experiments, mice received 50 μL intra-tumoral injections of either 3 mM NaCl or 3 mM MgCl 2 (both diluted in ddH 2 O). Injections of NaCl solution was applied in left flank tumor, whereas MgCl 2 solution was injected in contralateral tumor. I.t. injections were initiated once tumors were palpable, usually between day 5 and 10 after tumor injection. Injections were repeated every third day. Tumor size was quantified using a caliper and tumor volume was calculated using a rational ellipse formula (α 2 × β × π/6, α being the shorter axis and β the longer axis). In all survival experiments, mice were withdrawn from the study after any tumor dimension had reached a length greater than 15 mm.
On day 0, 0.25×10 6 MC38-OVA cells were implanted subcutaneously onto the flank of NSG mice (female mice, 6–8 weeks old). On day 9, 2.5×10 6 LFA-1 -/- or WT OT-I CTLs were transferred by tail-vein injection. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing was carried out as described above. From day 9 onwards, intratumoral 3 mM NaCl or 3 mM MgCl 2 injections were initiated and repeated every second to third day.
For CD8 depletion experiment, mice were immunized with OVA, as described above, and inoculated with 0.5×10 6 MC38-OVA cells unilaterally on the flank. Intratumoral injections of either 3 mM NaCl or 3 mM MgCl 2 were initiated, and repeated every third day as tumors became palpable. CD8 T cells were depleted by administering anti-CD8a Ab (53–6.72, BioXCell) at 10 mg kg -1 i.p. once per week.
For PD-1 blockade experiments, mice were immunized with OVA, as described above, and inoculated with 0.5×10 6 MC38-OVA cells unilaterally on the flank. As tumors became palpable - at day 5 - intratumoral injections of either 3 mM NaCl or 3 mM MgCl 2 were initiated, and repeated every third day for 8 cycles. Mice were additionally injected i.p. with isotype control (IgG2a) or anti-PD-1 Ab on day 9, 12, and 15 post-tumor implantations, at a dose of 200 μg per mouse diluted in 100 μL of pH-matched PBS (according to manufacturer’s recommendations). The antibodies used were: anti-PD-1 IgG2a Ab (clone RMP1-14) or IgG2a isotype control Ab (clone 2A3, both purchased from BioXCell).
Tumor tissue was isolated from mice, weighed and minced using razor blades. Tissue was then digested using accutase (PAA), collagenase IV (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), and DNAse type IV (Sigma) for 60 min at 37 °C with constant shaking. The cell suspensions were filtered using a cell strainer (70 μm). Precision Counting beads (Biolegend) were added before staining to quantify the number of cells per gram of tumor. Single cell suspensions were blocked with rat anti-mouse FcγIII/II receptor (CD16/CD32) blocking antibodies ('Fc-block') and stained with live/dead cell-exclusion dye. Cells were then incubated with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies directed against cell surface antigens, washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS+2% FBS). For intracellular/intranuclear antigens, cells stained with cell surface antibodies were fixed and permeabilized using Foxp3/transcription factor staining buffer (eBioscience) prior to incubation with antibodies directed against intracellular antigens.
Liposomes were prepared using the thin film-hydration method ( Huwyler et al., 1997 24. Huwyler, J. ∙ Yang, J. ∙ Pardridge, W.M. Receptor mediated delivery of daunomycin using immunoliposomes: Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution in the rat J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282 :1541-1546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lipid composition consisted of DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), Cholesterol (3β-Hydroxy-5-cholestene, 5-Cholesten-3β-ol, Sigma Aldrich, Schaffhausen, Switzerland), DSPE-PEG2000 (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000], Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), DSPE-PEG2000-Mal (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethyleneglycol)-2000], Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and DiI (DiIC18(3), Sigma Aldrich, Schaffhausen, Switzerland) at a molar ratio of 69:27:2.5:0.5:1. Lipids were mixed in ethanol and a homogenous thin film was prepared using a Rotavapor A-134 (Büchi, Switzerland). Dried lipid films were stored under vacuum overnight and rehydrated with either 150 mM NaCl or 100 mM MgCl 2 at 70°C with constant stirring. Liposomes were extruded 13x through polycarbonate filters with an average pore diameter of 100 nm (Nucleopore, Whatman, North Bend, OH). Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units (MWCO 10 kDa) were used to concentrate the liposomes and to exchange the buffer to PBS pH 7.2. The liposomes were used within 4 h for anti-PD-1 conjugation via SATA-maleimide conjugation chemistry. Briefly, anti-PD-1 antibodies (clone RMP1-14, BioXCell) were functionalized with 10x molar excess of SATA (N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate, Fisher Scientific, Reinach, Switzerland) to introduce sulfhydryl groups according to the supplier’s recommendations. The reactive sulfhydryl group on the antibody was then conjugated to the maleimide moieties on the liposome for 2 h at RT (ratio SH: maleimide = 1:4). Free maleimide groups were blocked by incubating with a 10x molar excess L-Cysteine for 30 min at RT. The anti-PD-1-conjugated liposomes were purified by gel filtration chromatography (Sepharose CL4B, elution buffer PBS pH 7.2). Fractions containing liposomes were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units (MWCO 10 kDa, Merck Millipore Ltd., Tullagreen, Carrigtwhohill, Co Cork IRL). Average size, size distribution and particle concentration were determined by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Ultra (Malvern Panalytical, Volketswil, Switzerland). For intratumoral liposome injection, 4×10 12 of MgCl 2 -loaded liposomes and 2.6×10 12 of NaCl-loaded liposomes were used. For immunoliposome experiments, 100 μg of anti-PD-1 Ab coupled to MgCl 2 - or NaCl-loaded liposomes were injected i.p. at indicated time points.
ANA concentrations were determined in murine serum 25 days after the start of i.t. NaCl or MgCl 2 injection as well in age- and sex-matched untreated control mice, using the mouse anti-nuclear antibody ELISA kit (Hoelzl Biotech) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Blinatumomab (Amgen) was derived from the leftover of infusions. Human PHA blasts were incubated with Ramos or LCL target cells in flat bottom 96 well-plate at a 0.5:1 ratio (6.5×10 4 PHA blasts and 1.3×10 5 target cells) at indicated Blinatumomab concentrations. In order to distinguish the different cell populations, PHA blasts were labeled with CTV and target cells with CFTR Invitrogen. Anti-CD18 antibodies, CBR-LFA-1/2 (unlabeled, Ultra-LEAF, BioLegend), TS1/18 (unlabeled, Ultra-LEAF, BioLegend) as well Mouse IgG1 κ Isotype control (unlabeled, Ultra-LEAF, BioLegend) were used at a final concentration of 10 μg mL -1 . For all co-incubation experiments, cells were allowed to sediment without centrifugation. For analysis of protein phosphorylation, co-incubation was terminated after 60 min with fixation of of 4% PFA and methanol as described in more detail above. For assessing LFA-1 headpiece opening, m24 antibody was directly added to the cell culture medium and stained for 30 min on ice before washing and subsequent fixation with 2% PFA. Cytotoxicity was quantified after 3.5 h with CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher) as described above. Caspase substrate was added for final 45 min of incubation at final concentration of 2 μM. Cells were harvested, washed in FACS Buffer and fixed with PFA 2% for 15 min at RT prior to analysis by FACS.
24 h before transfection, HEK-293T cells were seeded (3.8×10 6 cells 10 mL -1 media). All plasmid DNA was purified using the Endotoxin-free Plasmid Maxiprep Kit (Sigma). HEK-293T cells were transfected with 1.3 pmol psPAX2 (lentiviral packaging plasmid) and 0.72 pmol pMD2G (VSV-G envelope expressing plasmid) and 1.64 pmol of pCAR-CD19CAR-p2a-EGFP (Creative Biogene) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Optimem medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). The viral supernatant was collected 48 h after transduction. Viral particles were concentrated using PEG precipitation and stored at -80°C. Blood samples (Blood donor center, University Hospital Basel) were obtained from healthy donors after written informed consent. PBMCs were isolated by standard density-gradient centrifugation protocols (Lymphoprep; Fresenius Kabi). CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were positively selected using magnetic CD4 + and CD8 + beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were cultured in R10AB. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were plated into a 24-well cell culture plate and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb-coated beads (Miltenyj, T cell activation & expansion kit) in a ratio of 1:1 in medium containing IL-2 (150 U mL -1 ). T cells were transduced with lentiviral particles at 18-22 h after activation in media containing Polybrene (6 μg mL -1 , Millipore). Every second day medium was replaced with fresh IL-2 (150 U mL -1 ). Five days after transduction GFP + cells were sorted enrich CD19-CAR + cells and magnetic beads were removed from non-transduced cells. Cells were further expanded for 3 days in medium containing IL-2 (150 U mL -1 ) before the target cell killing assay.
CD8 + anti-CD19 CAR T-cells were incubated with Ramos target cells at a 0.1-0.33:1 ratio (0.5-1.5×10 4 CAR T cells and 5×10 4 Ramos Target cells). Ramos cells had been labeled with CFTR prior to co-incubation. Cells were allowed to sediment without centrifugation in flat bottom 96 well-plate and incubated for 3 h. Cytotoxicity was quantified by flow cytometry using BioTracker NucView 405 Blue Caspase-3 Dye (Sigma-Aldrich).
To generate human CD8 + CAR-T cells, we isolated CD8 + T cells from heathy donor PBMCs using the CD8 human microbead MACS kit according to manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were then cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma) with 10% heat inactivated human male AB + serum with 1mM Sodium Pyruvate (Sigma), 2mM Glutamine (contained in RPMI formulation), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), 5mM beta-mercapto-Ethanol (Gibco), 1% PenicilinStreptomycin (Sigma). Cells were stimulated on the same day with 1:1 ratio of CD3/CD28 beads (Human T cell Activation and Expansion kit, Miltenyi) and 150 U mL -1 rh-IL-2 (Proleukin). The next day, cells were collected into a falcon tube and 4 μg mL -1 Polybrene (Sigma) was added together with VSV-g pseudotyped lentivirus encoding an anti-human-CD19-FMC63vH chimeric antigen receptor with a CD28 transmembrane domain and a CD28 and CD3ζ signaling domain with a c-terminal T2A self-cleaving copGFP protein (anti-CD19-CD28z-T2A-copGFP). The cell and lentiviral mixture was centrifuged for 90 min at 1000 g (spinfection) and the resuspended and plated for 24 h at 37°C. Then cells were expanded 1:2 every 2 days for 2 iterations with fresh medium and 50 U/mL rh-IL-2. GFP + CD8 + (CD8-APC SK1 clone, Biolegend) live (DAPI, Sigma) cells were then sorted using a BD FACS Melody, washed in medium and the plated at 1.5 Mio mL -1 in fresh medium and 50 U mL -1 rh-IL-2 for another 24h. Cells were then counted, washed by centrifugation at 500g 3 min in PBS and transferred in PBS intravenously to female NSG mice (6-8 weeks old) subcutaneously injected 5 days before with 0.5 Mio Raji (ATCC) in 50% Matrigel (Corning, standard formulation). Intratumoral injections of either 3 mM NaCl or 3 mM MgCl 2 were initiated 7 days after tumor implantation, and repeated every second to third day.
High-titer replication-defective lentivirus was produced and concentrated by ultracentrifugation for primary T cell transduction. Briefly, 24 h before transfection, HEK-293 cells were seeded at 10 × 10 6 in 30 mL of medium in a T-150 tissue culture flask. All plasmid DNA was purified using the Endo-free Maxiprep kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). HEK-293T cells were transfected with 7 μg pVSV-G (VSV glycoprotein expression plasmid), 18 μg of R874 (Rev and Gag/Pol expression plasmid) and 15 μg of pELNS transgene plasmid, using a mix of Turbofect (Thermo Fisher) and Optimem medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, 180 μl of Turbofect for 3 mL of Optimem). The viral supernatant was collected 48 h after transfection. Viral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 24,000 x g and resuspended in 400 μl medium, followed by immediate snap freezing on dry ice.
Primary human T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors (HDs; prepared as buffycoats or apheresis filters). All blood samples were collected with informed consent of the healthy donors, and genetically engineered with ethics approval from the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. PBMC were obtained via Lymphoprep (Axonlab) separation solution, using a standard protocol of centrifugation. CD4 and CD8 + T cells were isolated using a magnetic bead-based negative selection kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations (easySEP, Stem Cell technology). Purified CD4 and CD8 + T cells were cultured at a 1:1 ratio and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Ab coated beads (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) at a ratio of 1:2 T cells to beads. T cells were transduced with lentivirus particles at 18-22 h after activation. Human recombinant IL-2 (h-IL-2; Glaxo) was replenished every other day for a concentration of 50 IU mL -1 until 5 days after stimulation (day + 5). At day + 5, magnetic beads were removed, and h-IL-7 and h-IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotec) were added to the cultures at 10 ng mL -1 replacing h-IL-2. A cell density of 0.5–1 × 10 6 cells mL -1 was maintained for expansion. Rested engineered T cells were adjusted for equivalent transgene expression before all functional assays.
Cytotoxicity assays were performed using the IncuCyte Instrument (Essen Bioscience). Briefly, 1.25×10 4 PC3-PIP target cells were seeded in flat bottom 96-well plates (Costar, Vitaris). Four hours later, rested T cells (no cytokine addition for 48 h) were washed and seeded at 2.5 × 10 4 per well, at a 2:1 effector to target ratio in self-made medium supplemented with 10% dFCS and ±0.6 mM MgCl 2 . No exogenous cytokines were added during the co-culture period. IncuCyte Caspase-3/7 (Essen Bioscience) was added at a final concentration of 5 μM in a total volume of 200 μl. Internal experimental negative controls were included in all assays, including co-incubation of untransduced (UTD)-T cells and tumor cells in the presence of IncuCyte Caspase-3/7 reagent to monitor spontaneous cell death over time. As a positive control, tumor cells alone were treated with 1% triton solution to evaluate maximal killing in the assay. Images of total green area per well were collected every 2 h of the co-culture. The total green area per well was obtained by using the same analysis protocol on the IncuCyte ZOOM software provided by Essen Bioscience. Cytotoxicity is reported as total area under the curve of the fluorescence driven by incorporation of cytotoxic green reagent in dead target cells (green area per μm 2 ). All data were normalized by subtracting the background fluorescence observed at time zero (before any cell killing by CAR T cells) from all further time points.
Cytokine release assays were performed by co-culture of 5×10 4 T cells with 5×10 4 target cells per well in 96-well round-bottom plates, in duplicate, in a final volume of 200 μl of self-made medium supplemented with 10% dFCS and 0.6 mM MgCl 2 or without Mg 2+ supplementation. After 24 h, the co-culture supernatants were collected and tested for the presence of IFN-γ by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BioLegend).
Male NSG mice of 10–12 weeks were put on Mg 2+ -restricted or matching control diet 5 days prior to tumor injection and kept on respective diet throughout the experiment. 5×10 6 PC3-PIP tumor cells were injected subcutaneously. After 5 days intravenous injection of saline solution or 2×10 6 T cells (UTD or CAR T cells) were adoptively transferred intravenously. Tumor volume was monitored twice per week. The animals were monitored daily and the tumors were calipered every other day. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula V=1/2(length × width 2 ), where length is the greatest longitudinal diameter and width is the greatest transverse diameter determined via caliper measurement.
Statistical significance was tested for using Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
