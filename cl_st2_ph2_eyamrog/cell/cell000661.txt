Title: Sublethal cytochrome c release generates drug-tolerant persister cells


Abstract: Summary

Drug-tolerant persister cells (persisters) evade apoptosis upon targeted and conventional cancer therapies and represent a major non-genetic barrier to effective cancer treatment. Here, we show that cells that survive treatment with pro-apoptotic BH3 mimetics display a persister phenotype that includes colonization and metastasis in vivo and increased sensitivity toward ferroptosis by GPX4 inhibition. We found that sublethal mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and holocytochrome c release are key requirements for the generation of the persister phenotype. The generation of persisters is independent of apoptosome formation and caspase activation, but instead, cytosolic cytochrome c induces the activation of heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase and engagement of the integrated stress response (ISR) with the consequent synthesis of ATF4, all of which are required for the persister phenotype. Our results reveal that sublethal cytochrome c release couples sublethal MOMP to caspase-independent initiation of an ATF4-dependent, drug-tolerant persister phenotype.

Section: Introduction

In addition to genetic events that mediate resistance to anti-cancer therapies, a major contribution to cancer relapse is the emergence of drug-tolerant cells, a phenomenon called persistence. A key feature of such persister cells (PS) is that in contrast to resistant cells, their drug-unresponsive phenotype is acquired and provides a temporary survival advantage toward treatment.
PS can be functionally defined as cells that remain alive following a cell-death-inducing treatment without the selection for resistance mutations. PS from different cancer cell lines treated under different conditions often have a number of features in common that differ from the untreated parental cells (PT) ( Shen et al., 2020 80. Shen, S. ∙ Vagner, S. ∙ Robert, C. Persistent cancer cells: the deadly survivors Cell. 2020; 183 :860-874 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). These features, which can serve as a “PS phenotype,” include (1) transient tolerance of the initial treatment and often other toxic treatments, (2) an acquired dependence on the lipid peroxidase, GPX4, (3) reduced cell cycle kinetics, and (4) similar gene expression profiles, often including an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) signature. The ability to adapt to microenvironmental stresses by altering phenotype is often evolutionarily conserved and is related to survival strategies in the face of starvation or diapause ( García-Jiménez and Goding, 2019 23.

Colorectal cancer cells enter a diapause-like DTP state to survive chemotherapy Cell. 2021; 184 :226-242.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the features of therapy-tolerant PS have been defined, the key molecular events that enable a cancer cell to bypass cell death on exposure to pro-apoptotic cancer therapeutics, especially after initial engagement of the apoptotic machinery, remain poorly understood.
As the best studied and most complex form of regulated cell death, apoptosis can be triggered by a wide range of cellular stresses (e.g., oncogenic, metabolic, and genetic) and therapeutics that converge on the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis ( Singh et al., 2019 81. Singh, R. ∙ Letai, A. ∙ Sarosiek, K. Regulation of apoptosis in health and disease: the balancing act of BCL-2 family proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :175-193 Crossref Scopus (610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Central to this pathway is the mitochondrion, which harbors in its intermembrane space (IMS) crucial caspase activators such as holocytochrome c ( Kalkavan and Green, 2018 42. Kalkavan, H. ∙ Green, D.R. MOMP, cell suicide as a BCL-2 family business Cell Death Differ. 2018; 25 :46-55 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The BCL-2 family effector proteins BAX, BAK, and BOK are responsible for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), triggering apoptosis ( Bhola and Letai, 2016 5. Bhola, P.D. ∙ Letai, A. Mitochondria—judges and executioners of cell death sentences Mol. Cell. 2016; 61 :695-704 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Anti-apoptotic proteins bind and hinder effector protein function. The pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins bind via their BH3 domains to anti-apoptotic proteins and/or directly to BAX and BAK to engage MOMP ( Garrido et al., 2006 24. Garrido, C. ∙ Galluzzi, L. ∙ Brunet, M. ... Mechanisms of cytochrome c release from mitochondria Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13 :1423-1433 Crossref Scopus (812) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tait and Green, 2013 89. Tait, S.W.G. ∙ Green, D.R. Mitochondrial regulation of cell death Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a008706 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). This important function of the BH3 domain has been exploited therapeutically as BH3 mimetics, such as navitoclax, venetoclax, and MCL-1 inhibitors ( Kalkavan and Green, 2018 42. Kalkavan, H. ∙ Green, D.R. MOMP, cell suicide as a BCL-2 family business Cell Death Differ. 2018; 25 :46-55 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ; Merino et al., 2018 59.

The initiation of the apoptotic cascade does not inevitably lead to cell death. Ongoing studies have focused on the consequences of incomplete MOMP (iMOMP) and sublethal caspase activity on cell fate, challenging the binary character of MOMP to reveal that cells do not always commit to cell death ( Tait et al., 2010 88. Tait, S.W. ∙ Parsons, M.J. ∙ Llambi, F. ... Resistance to caspase-independent cell death requires persistence of intact mitochondria Dev. Cell. 2010; 18 :802-813 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, iMOMP can occur, resulting in a more nuanced caspase activation and cell survival ( Ichim and Tait, 2016 37. Ichim, G. ∙ Tait, S.W.G. A fate worse than death: apoptosis as an oncogenic process Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :539-548 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A key and rapid adaptive survival response to a wide range of triggers relies on the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α by one of four kinases, EIF2AK1/heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), EIF2AK2/PKR, EIF2AK3/PERK, and EIF2AK4/GCN2, each responsive to distinct upstream stresses ( Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016 68. Pakos-Zebrucka, K. ∙ Koryga, I. ∙ Mnich, K. ... The integrated stress response EMBO Rep. 2016; 17 :1374-1395 Crossref Scopus (921) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting translational reprogramming suppresses global cap-dependent translation and enables translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins that function to alleviate the stress and promote survival ( Tian et al., 2021 92. Tian, X. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Zhou, L. ... Targeting the integrated stress response in cancer therapy Front. Pharmacol. 2021; 12 :747837 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among these is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) that initiates a gene expression program that in the short-term, promotes survival by increasing nutrient uptake and autophagy and suppressing oxidative stress ( Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020 15. Costa-Mattioli, M. ∙ Walter, P. The integrated stress response: From mechanism to disease Science. 2020; 368 :eaat5314 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we reveal that following treatment with pro-apoptotic BH3 mimetics, drug-tolerant persisters arise as a consequence of the activation of mitochondrial-nuclear communication relayed by iMOMP- and cytochrome c -dependent activation of HRI, leading to ATF4 synthesis and function. We found that the persister phenotype, induced by treatment with BH3 mimetics, is dependent on MOMP and the release of cytochrome c , as well as HRI and ATF4. Furthermore, we define a BAX-, BAK-, BOK-dependent and ATF4-dependent PS gene signature that can be found in patients with lung cancer and residual disease (RD) following therapy.

Section: Results

Cancer treatments generally converge on intrinsic apoptosis as their main cell death effector mechanism ( Singh et al., 2019 81. Singh, R. ∙ Letai, A. ∙ Sarosiek, K. Regulation of apoptosis in health and disease: the balancing act of BCL-2 family proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :175-193 Crossref Scopus (610) PubMed Google Scholar ). We utilized the highly specific BH3 mimetics ABT-737 and S63845 (S6) ( Kotschy et al., 2016 44. Kotschy, A. ∙ Szlavik, Z. ∙ Murray, J. ... The MCL1 inhibitor S63845 is tolerable and effective in diverse cancer models Nature. 2016; 538 :477-482 Crossref Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ), which target BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-w (ABT-737), and MCL1 (S6). We first confirmed maximal on-target doses by comparing wild type (WT) to BAX and BAK double knockout (DKO) or BAX, BAK , and BOK triple knockout (TKO) cells ( Figures 1 A, S1 A, and S1B). WT-therapy-persisting cells (PS) were released from therapy for 1 day and upon re-exposure to the drugs, proved to be less sensitive to treatment with BH3 mimetics ( Figures 1 B and S1 C). However, a longer drug holiday of 6 days restored the drug sensitivity of the initially drug-tolerant persisters to parental sensitivity ( Figures 1 B and S1 C), suggesting that the drug-tolerant persister state was transient. We then examined the behavior of PT and BH3-mimetic-induced PS in vivo . We generated PC9 PS by treatment with BH3 mimetics and compared the ability of PS to colonize the lungs with that of the untreated PT cells. PC9 cells were transduced with mNeonGreen or mCherry and were then used to generate PT and PS, respectively, allowing us to distinguish between each population in vivo . Equal numbers of mNeonGreen-expressing PT and mCherry-expressing PS were simultaneously injected i.v. into the tail veins of immunocompromised NSG mice. 9 weeks after injection, lungs were primarily colonized by PS and not by PT ( Figure 1 C). Similarly, intravital assessment of luciferase-labeled cells after tail vein injection showed that mice injected with BH3-mimetic-induced PS from the colon cancer cell line HCT116 had significantly higher tumor burden when compared with mice injected with HCT116 PT ( Figures 1 D and 1E).
Since these colonization assays mimic only the late phase of the metastatic cascade after intravasation, we exploited an in vivo orthotopic model of a lung tumor where we simultaneously injected PC9 PS and PT labeled with either Cell Trace Violet (CTV) or carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), respectively, into the left lungs of recipient animals. An advantage of these dyes is the strong and equal labeling of cells ( Figure 1 F). In line with previous studies in vitro , our PS displayed a slower proliferative rate than PT on day 2 after orthotopic injection ( Figure 1 F; Chen et al., 2012 12. Chen, J. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Yu, T.-S. ... A restricted cell population propagates glioblastoma growth after chemotherapy Nature. 2012; 488 :522-526 Crossref Scopus (1501) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oren et al., 2021 67. Oren, Y. ∙ Tsabar, M. ∙ Cuoco, M.S. ... Cycling cancer persister cells arise from lineages with distinct programs Nature. 2021; 596 :576-582 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shen et al., 2020 80. Shen, S. ∙ Vagner, S. ∙ Robert, C. Persistent cancer cells: the deadly survivors Cell. 2020; 183 :860-874 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the invasiveness and intravasation ability of the implanted lung tumor cells, we measured circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood collected from the right heart ventricle. Interestingly, we found significantly more circulating PS than PT at day 2 ( Figure 1 G). Next, we measured the metastatic ratio of the injected cells, which we defined as the cancer cell percentage in the contralateral lung divided by its percentage in the primary injection site. In line with the CTC result, the metastatic ratio revealed a higher metastatic capacity of PS generated from PC9 or A549 cells ( Figures 1 G and S1 D).
Next, we tested whether PS generated using BH3 mimetics led to cross-resistance toward other cancer therapies. We compared PT and PS derived from PC9 and HT29 cells and treated them with targeted and conventional standard-of-care cancer therapies in vitro ( Figures 1 H and S1 E). In both models, PS exhibited significantly increased viability after exposure to each drug.
Recent discoveries on drug-tolerant persisters revealed acquired dependency on the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 for their survival ( Hangauer et al., 2017 32. Hangauer, M.J. ∙ Viswanathan, V.S. ∙ Ryan, M.J. ... Drug-tolerant persister cancer cells are vulnerable to GPX4 inhibition Nature. 2017; 551 :247-250 Crossref Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2016 102. Yang, T. ∙ Xu, F. ∙ Sheng, Y. ... A targeted proteomics approach to the quantitative analysis of ERK/Bcl-2-mediated anti-apoptosis and multi-drug resistance in breast cancer Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2016; 408 :7491-7503 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Viability analysis of our apoptosis PS showed increased sensitivity to GPX4-inhibition by RSL3 compared with PT in PC9 and HT29 cells ( Figures 1 I, S1 F, and S1G). In line with this finding, the membrane-targeted lipid ROS sensor C11-BODIPY ( Yang et al., 2014 103. Yang, W.S. ∙ SriRamaratnam, R. ∙ Welsch, M.E. ... Regulation of ferroptotic cancer cell death by GPX4 Cell. 2014; 156 :317-331 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2193) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed increased lipid ROS levels ( Figure S1 H). Moreover, the expression of ChaC Glutathione (GSH)-Specific Gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) was upregulated, while the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) was downregulated in PS when compared with their PT counterpart ( Figure S1 I), both indicative of decreased GSH metabolism that may explain the increased dependence on GPX4 ( Tang et al., 2021 90. Tang, D. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Kang, R. ... Ferroptosis: molecular mechanisms and health implications Cell Res. 2021; 31 :107-125 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify common characteristics of PS generated with diverse therapies, we performed RNA-seq on therapy-persisting PC9 cells obtained by treatment with conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or BH3 mimetics ( Figure 1 J). Our analysis revealed common gene expression signatures related to metastasis and invasion, cellular stress responses, upregulated inflammatory signaling and EMT, downregulated fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and mTORC1 signaling ( Figures 1 J and S1 J). Collectively, these data indicate that PS generated using BH3 mimetics have the gene expression and phenotypic characteristics of drug-tolerant PS generated under different conditions as described by others.
By binding to the BH3-groove, BH3 mimetics enable the dissociation of the effector proteins BAX and BAK from the anti-apoptotic proteins and cause MOMP. However, anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptotic, and effector BCL-2 proteins are involved in diverse cell functions, and the BH3 domain is also necessary for the interaction between BH3-only proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins ( Kale et al., 2018 41. Kale, J. ∙ Osterlund, E.J. ∙ Andrews, D.W. BCL-2 family proteins: changing partners in the dance towards death Cell Death Differ. 2018; 25 :65-80 Crossref Scopus (593) PubMed Google Scholar ; Popgeorgiev et al., 2018 70. Popgeorgiev, N. ∙ Jabbour, L. ∙ Gillet, G. Subcellular localization and dynamics of the Bcl-2 family of proteins Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 6 :13 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether the presence of BCL-2 family effector proteins is necessary for our persister phenotype, we tested PC9 cells that are deficient in BAX, BAK , and BOK (TKO). We treated these TKO cells with our BH3 mimetics and compared them with the PT cells. The lung-colonization capacity of PS ( Figure 2 A) and their metastatic potential ( Figure 2 B) were dependent on the BCL2 effector proteins. Moreover, the sensitivity to RSL3-induced ferroptosis was similar between untreated and BH3-mimetic-pretreated TKO cells ( Figures 2 C and S2 A). In line with this finding, C11-BODIPY staining and CHAC1 and GCLC transcripts were not changed in BH3-mimetic-pretreated TKO cells when compared with PT ( Figures S2 B and S2C).
To elucidate the downstream pathways that might be involved in the engagement of the persister phenotype, we conducted RNA-seq of WT and TKO cells treated with control (MOCK) or BH3 mimetics. Enrichment analysis of BAX-, BAK-, BOK-dependent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PS versus PT ( Figure 2 D) further confirmed the overall dependence on BCL-2 effector proteins for our previously identified pathways, such as the upregulation of NF-κB signaling, EMT, the downregulation of mTORC1 signaling, and fatty acid metabolism and revealed additional pathways such as interleukin signaling and “response of EIF2AK1 (HRI) to heme deficiency” ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Interestingly, many of the DEGs identified have been associated with metastasis, angiogenesis, and cancer immune evasion ( Figures 2 G and S2 D). Moreover, a stratification of the top 10 upregulated and downregulated DEGs into pathways such as EMT and the cell cycle further identified potential genes implicated in our persister phenotype ( Figure 2 H).
Previous work has shown that downregulation of GSH metabolism correlates with sensitivity toward ferroptosis ( Oren et al., 2021 67. Oren, Y. ∙ Tsabar, M. ∙ Cuoco, M.S. ... Cycling cancer persister cells arise from lineages with distinct programs Nature. 2021; 596 :576-582 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, our data reveal several downregulated DEGs that participate in the GSH metabolism pathway in WT PS but not in TKO that have been treated with BH3 mimetics ( Figure 2 I).
To gain more insight into the mechanisms that underlie the generation of the persister phenotype, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on PC9 PT and corresponding PS at 1st, 3rd, and 7th days (PS1D, PS3D, and PS7D, respectively) after BH3-mimetic treatment. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis revealed the distinct transcriptomes of PT and the initial (PS1D) persister phenotype, as well as the trending of late PS (PS3D and PS7D) toward PT ( Figure 3 A). To dissect the initial events that distinguish PS from PT and late PS, we next performed a trajectory analysis also known as pseudotime, which is a computational method that organizes a population of cells into a progression that is consistent with patterns of identified dynamic processes, presumed to represent changes in the cell states over time ( Van den Berge et al., 2020 95. Van den Berge, K. ∙ Roux de Bézieux, H. ∙ Street, K. ... Trajectory-based differential expression analysis for single-cell sequencing data Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1201 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Street et al., 2018 84. Street, K. ∙ Risso, D. ∙ Fletcher, R.B. ... Slingshot: cell lineage and pseudotime inference for single-cell transcriptomics BMC Genomics. 2018; 19 :477 Crossref Scopus (513) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas late PS exhibited comparable pseudotime states to PT, PS1D were enriched for a clearly distinct and earlier state, suggestive of a gradual return to the PT phenotype after BH3-mimetic treatment ( Figure 3 A). Interestingly, genes from clusters activated relatively early in pseudotime were significantly enriched for the EMT pathway (cluster 1) and the integrated stress response (ISR; cluster 3; Figures 3 B, 3C, S2 E, and S2F). In contrast, clusters corresponding to later pseudotimes (2 and 4) were enriched for genes central to DNA replication and cell cycle progression, both hallmarks for late PS and PT. These cluster enrichments also corresponded to differences in gene set module scores across the PT and PS conditions in real time, independently linking these biological processes with the experimental conditions ( Figure 3 D). These data also help to indicate specific genes that may underly the PS phenotype with broad involvement in metabolism, inflammation, and cell cycle ( Figure S2 F). Furthermore, the upregulation of genes involved in the ISR in day 1 PS that gradually waned over the ensuing days corresponded to the transient state of PS ( Figures 3 D and S2 F).
We explored if and how the ISR was related to MOMP and the persister phenotype. Consistent with our transcriptomic analysis, we confirmed the engagement of the ISR upon BH3-mimetic treatment by detection of the phosphorylation of eIF2⍺ observed within the first hour after treatment and subsequent detection of ATF4 ( Figure 4 A). Consequently, PS contained elevated levels of nuclear ATF4 compared with PT as assessed by confocal imaging ( Figures 4 B–4D).
To determine whether the translation switch occurs in our BH3-mimetic-induced PS, we engineered an ATF4 translation reporter ( Figure 4 E). Treatment with BH3 mimetics led to increased reporter activity in WT cells ( Figures 4 F and S3 A). This was inhibited by 2BAct, which prevents phosphorylated eIF2α from reprogramming protein translation ( Hetz et al., 2019 36. Hetz, C. ∙ Axten, J.M. ∙ Patterson, J.B. Pharmacological targeting of the unfolded protein response for disease intervention Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15 :764-775 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), and by the ISR inhibitor ISRIB ( Figure S3 B; Rabouw et al., 2019 71. Rabouw, H.H. ∙ Langereis, M.A. ∙ Anand, A.A. ... Small molecule ISRIB suppresses the integrated stress response within a defined window of activation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :2097-2102 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significantly, BH3-mimetic-treated BAX, BAK, BOK TKO cells failed to activate the luciferase reporter ( Figure 4 F).
iMOMP, followed by minimal caspase activity upon apoptosis failure, can be associated with cancer cell aggressiveness, mutability, and metastasis ( Berthenet et al., 2020 4. Berthenet, K. ∙ Castillo Ferrer, C. ∙ Fanfone, D. ... Failed apoptosis enhances melanoma cancer cell aggressiveness Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107731 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ichim and Tait, 2016 37. Ichim, G. ∙ Tait, S.W.G. A fate worse than death: apoptosis as an oncogenic process Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :539-548 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oberst et al., 2016 65. Oberst, A. ∙ Ichim, G. ∙ Tait, S.W.G. Mitochondria and cell death Hockenbery, D.M. (Editor) Mitochondria Cell Death Humana Press, 2016; 213-226 Crossref Google Scholar ). To test whether caspase activation is also necessary for ATF4 activation, we treated Casp9-deficient cells with BH3 mimetics. These cells are unable to activate the caspase cascade ( Kuida et al., 1998 46. Kuida, K. ∙ Haydar, T.F. ∙ Kuan, C.-Y. ... Reduced apoptosis and cytochrome c–mediated caspase activation in mice lacking caspase 9 Cell. 1998; 94 :325-337 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) but retained the ability to induce the luciferase translation reporter upon BH3-mimetic treatment ( Figure 4 G). Concordantly, APAF1- and Casp 9- deficient cells expressed ATF4 in response to treatment with BH3 mimetics ( Figure 4 H), as did cells treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh ( Caserta et al., 2003 11. Caserta, T.M. ∙ Smith, A.N. ∙ Gultice, A.D. ... Q-VD-OPh, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor with potent antiapoptotic properties Apoptosis. 2003; 8 :345-352 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 I).
We then tested which eIF2⍺ kinase is responsible for eIF2⍺ phosphorylation and ATF4 translation. Upon treatment, only cells silenced for HRI (EIF2AK1) displayed decreased luciferase reporter activity compared with cells silenced for the other kinases ( Figure 4 J). Similarly, treatment with BH3 mimetics of WT but not of HRI-deficient cells led to increased nuclear ATF4 protein ( Figures 4 K and S3 C). Therefore, BH3 mimetics induce an ISR via HRI, which is dependent on the BCL-2 effectors but independent of caspase activation.
The dependency on BAX and BAK for the generation of PS suggested that iMOMP in surviving cells might be essential for ISR engagement. We engineered a reporter to reveal mitochondrial permeabilization using a split-superfoldGFP (sfGFP) system ( Figures 5 A and 5B) in which GFP1-10 was fused to mCherry and was localized with a fused IMS-localized tail sequence, while a double GFP11 beta strand was localized to the cytoplasm. We predicted that MOMP would enable the translocation of GFP11 into the IMS by passive diffusion, where it could then associate with GFP1-10 to fluoresce green ( Figure 5 B). Using this MOMP sensor in A549 PS cells revealed an increased GFP signal ( Figure 5 C), which was prevented by silencing of BAX and BAK ( Figures 5 D and S3 D). In contrast, cells treated with Raptinal, which induces MOMP in a BAX-, BAK-, and BOK-independent manner ( Heimer et al., 2019 35. Heimer, S. ∙ Knoll, G. ∙ Schulze-Osthoff, K. ... Raptinal bypasses BAX, BAK, and BOK for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and intrinsic apoptosis Cell Death Dis. 2019; 10 :556 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed an increased signal in both siNT and si BAX and si BAK -treated cells ( Figure 5 D). We next tested if the activation of ATF4 protein expression was associated with the extent of MOMP in our PS. Indeed, GFP-high cells that had undergone more extensive sublethal MOMP than GFP-low PS showed higher ATF4 ( Figure 5 E). Moreover, GFP-high PS displayed increased metastatic potential compared with their GFP-low PS counterparts ( Figure 5 F). These results support the idea that BCL-2 effector proteins promote ATF4 expression and increased colonization by PS in vivo due to their role in MOMP. Accordingly, WT cells displayed eIF2⍺ phosphorylation and ATF4 expression upon BH3 mimetics or Raptinal treatment ( Figure 5 G), while BAX, BAK, BOK TKO cells only did so upon treatment with Raptinal ( Figures 4 F and 5 H). Furthermore, Raptinal-treated TKO cells showed an increased metastatic potential in vivo ( Figure S3 E), which was not observed when such cells were treated with BH3 mimetics ( Figure 2 B).
To test the possibility that MOMP, independent of apoptosome and caspase activation, could drive metastatic potential in PS, we also generated PS from APAF1- and caspase-9-deficient PC9 cells. Indeed, intra-pulmonal injection of PT and PS cells from both lines showed increased metastatic ratio in PS compared with the PT counterpart ( Figures 5 I and 5J).
Cytochrome c (encoded by CYCS ) has a crucial role in the activation of APAF1 and caspases following MOMP ( Hao et al., 2005 33. Hao, Z. ∙ Duncan, G.S. ∙ Chang, C.-C. ... Specific ablation of the apoptotic functions of cytochrome c reveals a differential requirement for cytochrome c and Apaf-1 in apoptosis Cell. 2005; 121 :579-591 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2000 49. Li, K. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Shelton, J.M. ... Cytochrome c deficiency causes embryonic lethality and attenuates stress-induced apoptosis Cell. 2000; 101 :389-399 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, silencing of CYCS significantly reduced ATF4 activation upon BH3-mimetic treatment ( Figures 6 A and S4 A–S4C). Additionally, when bovine cytochrome c was added to cytosolic extracts of WT cells, it led not only to caspase activation as previously described ( Liu et al., 1996 52. Liu, X. ∙ Kim, C.N. ∙ Yang, J. ... Induction of apoptotic program in cell-free extracts: requirement for dATP and cytochrome c Cell. 1996; 86 :147-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4405) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also to eIF2⍺ phosphorylation, which depended on the presence of HRI ( Figures 6 B, 6C, and S4 D).
Next, we asked if the cytochrome c K72R mutant, which is incapable of activating APAF1 ( Hao et al., 2005 33. Hao, Z. ∙ Duncan, G.S. ∙ Chang, C.-C. ... Specific ablation of the apoptotic functions of cytochrome c reveals a differential requirement for cytochrome c and Apaf-1 in apoptosis Cell. 2005; 121 :579-591 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ), can engage the ISR upon treatment with BH3 mimetics ( Figures S4 E, S4F, and S4G). Treatment of cells expressing WT and/or mutant cytochrome c led to an increase of ATF4, whereas cytochrome c -deficient cells harboring only an empty vector control (pEVEC) showed no ATF4 protein expression upon treatment ( Figure 6 D). Similarly, A549 cells that express CYCS K72R , upon silencing of endogenous CYCS with an UTR-targeting siRNA, expressed ATF4 upon treatment with BH3 mimetics, while silencing of both endogenously and ectopically expressed mutant cytochrome c significantly diminished ATF4 expression ( Figures S4 H and S4I). Silencing of holocytochrome c synthase ( HCCS ), required for the generation of mature cytochrome c , also prevented the synthesis of ATF4 upon BH3 mimetic treatment ( Figures 6 E and S4 C).
We then generated PS from cytochrome c -deficient cells reconstituted, or not, with WT or K72R mutant cytochrome c . While BH3-mimetic-pretreated or untreated CYCS -deficient cells showed similar sensitivity toward a variety of drugs tested, PS from either reconstituted cell lines displayed drug tolerance ( Figures 6 F, 6G, S5 A, and S5B). Additionally, in comparison with PT, PS from cells with reconstituted mutant cytochrome c displayed enhanced metastatic potential ( Figure 6 H). While we observed no difference in the recovery of BH3-mimetic-pretreated or untreated CYCS -deficient cells, it is likely that such cells do not survive in vivo , and therefore we did not examine their metastatic potential. Hence, the ability of BH3 mimetics to generate PS is dependent on cytochrome c but independent of its ability to induce apoptosis.
We then asked if the genes that had been identified as regulated in PS in a BAX-, BAK-dependent manner were also regulated in a CYCS -dependent manner. Genes that are relevant for GSH metabolism, and hence might account for the RSL3 sensitivity of PS, were upregulated or downregulated by treatment with BH3 mimetics, dependent on CYCS expression ( Figure 6 I). Interestingly, the expression of CHAC1 , which is involved in GSH degradation ( Crawford et al., 2015 16. Crawford, R.R. ∙ Prescott, E.T. ∙ Sylvester, C.F. ... Human CHAC1 protein degrades glutathione, and mRNA induction is regulated by the transcription factors ATF4 and ATF3 and a bipartite ATF/CRE regulatory element J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :15878-15891 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ), was upregulated only in the presence of cytochrome c . In contrast, the CHAC cation transport regulator homolog 2 ( CHAC2 ), which competes with CHAC1 to prevent GSH degradation ( Wang et al., 2017 99. Wang, C.-K. ∙ Yang, S.-C. ∙ Hsu, S.-C. ... CHAC2 is essential for self-renewal and glutathione maintenance in human embryonic stem cells Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2017; 113 :439-451 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), was downregulated in a cytochrome c -dependent manner. Similarly, genes including CREB5 , ATF3 , PDK1 , and PTGS2 showed significantly diminished expression in CYCS -deficient BH3-mimetic-treated cells compared with CYCS reconstituted PS ( Figures 6 J and S5 C).
We then performed experiments with recombinant eIF2⍺ and HRI and purified bovine cytochrome c . We observed increased phosphorylation of eIF2⍺ upon addition of cytochrome c ( Figures 6 K and S5 D). HRI is constitutively active and is inhibited by hemin ( Berlanga et al., 1998 3. Berlanga, J.J. ∙ Herrero, S. ∙ Haro, C. de.

Chem. 1992; 267 :20519-20524 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the inhibition of HRI by hemin did not occur in the presence of cytochrome c ( Figure 6 L). To further investigate whether cytochrome c and HRI physically interact in cells upon treatment with BH3 mimetics, we performed immunoprecipitation of endogenous cytochrome c and IgG control from PC9 APAF1-deficient cells that had been treated with or without BH3 mimetics, resulting in co-immunoprecipitation of HRI and cytochrome c ( Figure 6 M) (a low-level of co-immunoprecipitation of HRI with cytochrome c in untreated cells was likely due to the release of cytochrome c upon lysis). In another approach, we expressed HRI-mClover or mClover in A549 cells before BH3-mimetic treatment ( Figure S5 E). Immunoprecipitation of HRI-mClover resulted not only in the co-immunoprecipitation of cytochrome c but also of endogenous HRI, indicative of an activation-induced dimerization of HRI, which has been described by others ( Bauer et al., 2001 2. Bauer, B.N. ∙ Rafie-Kolpin, M. ∙ Lu, L. ... Multiple autophosphorylation is essential for the formation of the active and stable homodimer of heme-regulated eIF2α kinase Biochemistry. 2001; 40 :11543-11551 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, we generated lysates from HRI-mClover- or mClover-expressing A549 cells and incubated them with equine cytochrome c . Immunoprecipitation of HRI-mClover resulted not only in the pull-down of cytochrome c but also of eIF2⍺, the substrate of HRI ( Figure S5 F). Therefore, the engagement of HRI and the ISR, leading to the PS phenotype, is a direct effect of the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol and its interaction with HRI following iMOMP.
The involvement of ATF4 in various aspects of cancer aggressiveness has been described ( Dey et al., 2015 17. Dey, S. ∙ Sayers, C.M. ∙ Verginadis, I.I. ... ATF4-dependent induction of heme oxygenase 1 prevents anoikis and promotes metastasis J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :2592-2608 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with this, cells silenced for ATF4 and treated with BH3 mimetics revealed that the statistically significant upregulation of the EMT pathway is dependent on ATF4 ( Figure 7 A). Several well-defined transcriptional targets of ATF4 showed increased expression at early pseudotime, characteristic of PS1D in our scRNA-seq analysis ( Figure S6 A). We therefore asked whether ATF4 is the main driver of our observed persister phenotype. Since BH3-mimetic-induced PS also showed an upregulation of other stress-associated modulators, such as NRF-2 and HO-1, both of which have been associated with cancer aggressiveness ( Bialk et al., 2018 6. Bialk, P. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Banas, K. ... Functional gene knockout of NRF2 increases chemosensitivity of human Lung Cancer A549 Cells In Vitro and in a Xenograft Mouse Model Mol. Ther.

Niture, S.K. ∙ Jaiswal, A.K. Nrf2 protein up-regulates antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and prevents cellular apoptosis J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :9873-9886 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested the response to BH3 mimetics upon silencing these regulators. The absence of ATF4 led to significant therapy sensitivity and reduced the occurrence of PS in different cell lines ( Figures 7 B and S6 B–S6D), while NRF-2 and HO-1 appeared to be dispensable. Early PS displayed an increased sensitivity toward 2BAct ( Figure 7 C). To test the role of ATF4 in the persister phenotype, we generated ATF4 - deficient cells ( Figure S6 E) and treated them with BH3 mimetics. Surviving cells were exposed to a variety of pro-apoptotic anti-cancer drugs, revealing equal or higher sensitivity to the same drugs as ATF4 −/− PT ( Figure 7 D).
Since BH3 mimetics induce BCL-2-effector-mediated apoptotic cell death, we wondered if the effector proteins were present in PS. BAX but not the other effector proteins was decreased in PS ( Figure S6 F). It has been reported that the absence of BAX can lead to chemoresistance ( Erler et al., 2004 19. Erler, J.T. ∙ Cawthorne, C.J. ∙ Williams, K.J. ... Hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of bid and Bax in tumors occurs via hypoxia-inducible factor 1-dependent and -independent mechanisms and contributes to drug resistance Mol. Cell.

Multidomain Bcl-2 homolog Bax but not Bak mediates synergistic induction of apoptosis by TRAIL and 5-FU through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway Oncogene. 2004; 23 :8320-8332 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Silencing of BAX , BAK , or BOK in PC9 cells before treatment with BH3 mimetics revealed that the absence of BAX alone almost completely abolished sensitivity to the drugs ( Figures 7 E and S6 G) and also decreased sensitivity toward other therapies in PC9 cells ( Figure S6 H). To evaluate whether the decrease in BAX relied on the cytochrome c -dependent activation of the ISR, we tested CYCS -, ATF4 -, and HRI -deficient cells treated with BH3 mimetics ( Figures 7 F and 7G). We observed that BAX was decreased only in WT cells that had survived BH3-mimetic treatment. Transcript levels of BAX were similar in cytochrome c -proficient and cytochrome c -deficient cells ( Figure S6 I), suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation was responsible for the decreased BAX levels in our PS. One possible explanation for the reduction in BAX might be the engagement of autophagy, which can target BAX for degradation ( Feng et al., 2018 20. Feng, D. ∙ Amgalan, D. ∙ Singh, R. ...

Invest. 2018; 128 :3941-3956 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guan et al., 2015 26. Guan, J.-J. ∙ Zhang, X.-D. ∙ Sun, W. ... DRAM1 regulates apoptosis through increasing protein levels and lysosomal localization of BAX Cell Death Dis. 2015; 6 :e1624 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). ATF4 has been shown to induce autophagy ( B’chir et al., 2013 1. B’chir, W. ∙ Maurin, A.-C. ∙ Carraro, V. ... The eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is essential for stress-induced autophagy gene expression Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :7683-7699 Crossref Scopus (617) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rzymski et al., 2009 77. Rzymski, T. ∙ Milani, M. ∙ Singleton, D.C. ... Role of ATF4 in regulation of autophagy and resistance to drugs and hypoxia Cell Cycle. 2009; 8 :3838-3847 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ), and consistent with this, we observed that the degradation of p62/SQSTM1, a consequence of autophagy, occurred in BH3-mimetic-treated WT but not ATF4 - or HRI -deficient cells ( Figure 7 G).
We examined the sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition and found that the increased sensitivity in PS was abrogated in ATF4- and HRI-deficient BH3 mimetic survivors ( Figures 7 H, 7I, S6 J, and S6K), which corresponded to changes in lipid peroxidation ( Figure S6 L) and CHAC1 and GCLC expression ( Figures S6 M and S6N). Next, we tested the metastatic capacity of ATF4- and HRI - deficient cells and their BH3-mimetic-treatment-surviving cells in vivo . The increased metastatic ratio of WT PS cells ( Figure 1 G) was largely abolished in the absence of ATF4 ( Figure 7 J) or HRI ( Figure 7 K).
To determine whether ATF4 activation could induce a persister phenotype independent of iMOMP, we treated cells with Tunicamycin (TM), which leads to ATF4 translation independent of BCL-2 effector proteins or caspase-9 ( Figure S6 Q). These TM-induced PS revealed decreased sensitivity toward diverse chemotherapies ( Figure S6 R) and increased sensitivity toward GPX4 inhibition with RSL3 ( Figure S6 S).
Finally, we performed a stringent comparative analysis of DEGs in BH3-mimetic-treated WT cells that are absent in treated ATF4 - or BAX- and BAK -silenced cells ( Figure 7 L), which revealed several target genes implicated in inflammatory signaling and immune evasion, metabolism, migration, and invasion ( Figure 7 M). We suggest that this gene set represents an “apoptosis persister signature.” To test its clinical relevance, we applied gene set enrichment analysis on published scRNA-seq data from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples ( Maynard et al., 2020 56. Maynard, A. ∙ McCoach, C.E. ∙ Rotow, J.K. ... Therapy-induced evolution of human lung cancer revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing Cell. 2020; 182 :1232-1251.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, gene set module scores for upregulated or downregulated apoptosis persister genes were significantly greater among samples from patients with RD compared with those who were treatment naive (TN) or were having progressive disease ( Figure 7 N). Furthermore, the reactome HRI gene set score was increased in RD, while the KEGG GSH metabolism gene score was significantly decreased in RD compared with TN ( Figure 7 O).
Because our experimental results identified HRI as the relevant kinase for translation reprogramming and generation of the persister phenotype in PC9 LUAD cells, we wondered if HRI expression was present in cancer samples. Pathology samples from lung, breast, gastric, and ovary cancers showed much stronger expression of HRI compared with their normal tissue counterparts ( Figure S7 A). HRI gene expression is significantly higher in various tumors when compared with the normal tissues ( Figures S7 B and S7C), including LUAD and colon adenocarcinomas. Since RNA-seq data revealed a high inter-patient variation in HRI expression ( Figure S7 C), we asked if HRI ( EIF2AK1 ) expression correlates with patient survival. We interrogated disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with HRI -high (1st quartile) versus HRI -low (4th quartile) tumors. Many HRI-high tumor-bearing patients showed decreased survival and significantly increased hazard ratios (HRs) compared with patients with HRI-low tumors ( Figures 7 P, S7 D, S7E, S7F, and S7G).

Section: Discussion

Our work uncovers a new function for cytochrome c in promoting survival in the presence of a sublethal incident. We provide evidence of how iMOMP and the release of cytochrome c drive translation reprogramming in cells that survive the initiation of apoptosis. As a major consequence of eIF2α phosphorylation, ATF4 mRNA translation leads to the initiation of the various downstream pathways that are critical for the persister phenotype, including metabolic reprogramming, cell cycle inhibition, immune evasion, and EMT induction.
Additionally, we found that our persister phenotype includes an increased metastatic potential of PS. While the often-described EMT signature of PS is suggestive of an increased metastatic capacity ( Nieto, 2011 63.

We identified the HRI as the critical kinase that leads to eIF2⍺ phosphorylation and translational reprogramming in PC9 cells treated with BH3-mimetic drugs. Our fundamental knowledge about HRI originated in research on erythropoiesis, where iron deficiency leads to the autophosphorylation and dimerization of HRI and thus its activation ( Berlanga et al., 1998 3. Berlanga, J.J. ∙ Herrero, S. ∙ Haro, C. de. Characterization of the Hemin-sensitive Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2α kinase from Mouse Nonerythroid Cells ∗ J. Biol.

HRI coordinates translation necessary for protein homeostasis and mitochondrial function in erythropoiesis eLife. 2019; 8 :e46976 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). This evolutionarily conserved pathway appears to be present in non-hematopoetic cells, including cancer cells where we found that high expression of HRI correlates with decreased survival of cancer patients. Our work reveals the crucial impact of HRI on cancer cell survival by linking sublethal cytochrome c release to HRI activation. It also provides a possible explanation for the increased sensitivity toward ferroptosis in drug-tolerant persisters when GSH metabolism is altered, as a linked trade-off for survival when translational reprogramming takes place. Transcriptomic changes in the metabolome, including a downregulation of the mTORC1 pathway that is dependent on sublethal apoptosis initiation and ATF4 activation, is in line with the findings where mitochondrial dysfunction was accompanied by HRI activation and mTORC1 downregulation ( Condon et al., 2021 14. Condon, K.J. ∙ Orozco, J.M. ∙ Adelmann, C.H. ... Genome-wide CRISPR screens reveal multitiered mechanisms through which mTORC1 senses mitochondrial dysfunction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

HRI coordinates translation necessary for protein homeostasis and mitochondrial function in erythropoiesis eLife. 2019; 8 :e46976 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ).
MOMP can play a role in caspase-independent cell death (CICD), where death is relayed by a loss of mitochondrial function ( Lartigue et al., 2009 47. Lartigue, L. ∙ Kushnareva, Y. ∙ Seong, Y. ... Caspase-independent mitochondrial cell death results from loss of respiration, not cytotoxic protein release Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20 :4871-4884 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous work on CICD indicated that in the absence of caspase activation, cells that had evaded death after the engagement of MOMP and cytochrome c release were dependent on the activation of the autophagy machinery and intact mitochondria ( Colell et al., 2007 13. Colell, A. ∙ Ricci, J.-E. ∙ Tait, S. ... GAPDH and autophagy preserve survival after apoptotic cytochrome c release in the absence of caspase activation Cell. 2007; 129 :983-997 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since ATF4 is a well-known activator of autophagy ( Sui et al., 2013 86. Sui, X. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Wang, Z. ... Autophagy and chemotherapy resistance: a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4 :e838 Crossref Scopus (820) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results provide a possible mechanistic explanation for how pro-apoptotic effectors can promote survival. We do not know, however, whether engagement of autophagy is indeed responsible for the transient drug tolerance that we observe in PS, or if this applies to PS generated under other conditions.
Previous work has also documented how mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to the cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial proteins and a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt ), which in turn activates the expression of ATF4 ( Melber and Haynes, 2018 58. Melber, A. ∙ Haynes, C.M. UPRmt regulation and output: a stress response mediated by mitochondrial-nuclear communication Cell Res. 2018; 28 :281-295 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, our results indicate that unlike the UPR mt , the engagement of ATF4 by the ISR in PS does not primarily rely on mitochondrial damage itself but instead is dependent on cytochrome c release to the cytosol. Recent evidence revealed that release of the IMS protein DELE1 after cleavage by OMA1 can activate the ISR via HRI ( Fessler et al., 2020 21. Fessler, E. ∙ Eckl, E.-M. ∙ Schmitt, S. ... A pathway coordinated by DELE1 relays mitochondrial stress to the cytosol Nature. 2020; 579 :433-437 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guo et al., 2020 28. Guo, X. ∙ Aviles, G. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Mitochondrial stress is relayed to the cytosol by an OMA1–DELE1–HRI pathway Nature. 2020; 579 :427-432 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether MOMP is necessary for DELE1 release and the biological consequences of DELE1 release in our system remain unclear.
Additionally, iMOMP can lead to sublethal caspase activation ( Liu et al., 2015 51. Liu, X. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Li, F. ... Caspase-3 promotes genetic instability and carcinogenesis Mol. Cell. 2015; 58 :284-296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miles and Hawkins, 2017 61. Miles, M.A. ∙ Hawkins, C.J.

Although, our data support a mechanism that is independent of caspases, there is evidence that caspase activation in a drug-persisting cancer cell induces EMT, can activate PKR, and increases mutability by the sublethal activation of caspase-activated DNAse (CAD) ( Berthenet et al., 2020 4.

Chem. 2001; 276 :41620-41628 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, it is possible that adaptive responses can be engaged on various levels after sublethal MOMP initiation.
Our approach in this study was to investigate—without any other perturbations—the role of sublethal engagement of apoptosis. Thus, we created controlled circumstances to induce PS by the use of BH3 mimetics and in vitro induction of cell death, followed by assessment of the persister phenotype in vitro and in vivo . The extent to which our findings apply to PS induced by other drug treatments and the further application of our findings to patient data from human primary cancers and RD will be important. Since other therapeutic treatments can likely engage the ISR via other mechanisms than cytochrome c -induced HRI activity, the generalizability of our BH3-mimetic PS and the mechanism we uncovered require further investigation. This especially applies to in vivo settings where cells that survive therapeutic insult are more challenging to study.

RAG1 k.o. ( Figure 1 E) and NOD.Cg-Prkdcsscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) (all other animal models) mice were used for tumormodels. Age and sex matched cohorts of 5 to 12-weeks-old females and males were used in all experiments. The St. Jude Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. All mice were housed in pathogen-free facilities, in a 12-hour light/dark cycle in ventilated cages, with chow and water supply ad libitum .
Human lung cancer cell line PC9 was purchased from Millipore Sigma (Cat# 90071810). Human lung cancer cell line A549 was kindly provided by Richard J. Webby (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital). Human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 was a gift from Richard Youle ( Wang and Youle, 2011 98. Wang, C. ∙ Youle, R. Predominant requirement of Bax for apoptosis in HCT116 cells is determined by Mcl-1’s inhibitory effect on Bak Oncogene. 2011; 31 onc2011497 Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar ). Cancer cell line HT29 (human colorectal) and H226 (human Mesothelioma) were purchased from ATCC.
Cells were maintained in complete DMEM media (10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin). For culturing CYCS k.o. cells medium was additionally supplemented with 50μg/ml uridine (Sigma) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO). All cells used in this study were cultivated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
All the cell lines used in tumor studies were confirmed as mycoplasma negative using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection kit (Lonza #LT07). All cell lines have been authenticated by Hartwell Center (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital).
Clonogenic survival was assessed by methylene blue staining.
PC9 stably expressing mNeon Green were used as PT. PC9 cells stably expressing mCherry were treated with ABT737 1.5 μM and S63845 3 μM for 6 h followed by wash and release into complete medium for 2 h, to generate PS. EasySep Dead Cell Removal (Annexin V) kit (Stemcell Technologies) was used to harvest live cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PT and PS were injected in combination (0.4 x10 6 cells in total per mouse) into the teil vein of NSG mice (200μl in DMEM). When animals were getting symptomatic due to disease progression they have been euthanized in accordance with our existing humane endpoints (9 weeks post injection) to assess organ colonization. For ex vivo processing of lung colonization lungs of animals were resected and kept in PBS. Tissue was minced using scissors and digested in trypsin supplemented with 100 μg/ml Liberase TM (Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 μg/ml Deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min incubation at 37°C 5% CO 2 . Organs were then resuspended in DMEM containing 5% FCS, pipetted up-and down and passed through a 40 mm strainer. Cells were then washed in FACS Buffer (1g/l sodium azide, 10 g/l PBS powder, 2.5mM EDTA, 1% FCS in MilliQ filtered water). Fixation was performed using 2% formalin in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in permeabilization buffer (1mg/ml Saponin in FACS buffer). Cells were then stained with Chromotek GFP- and RFP booster for 30 minutes at 4°C. A final wash in permeabilization buffer was performed before FACS analysis.
PC9 WT or BAX, BAK, BOK TKO cells stably expressing tdTomato and firefly luciferase were used as PT. Another batch of the same cells were treated with ABT737 1.5 μM and S63845 3 μM for 6 h followed by wash and release into complete medium for 2 h, to generate PS. EasySep Dead Cell Removal (Annexin V) kit (Stemcell Technologies) was used to harvest live cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PT and PS were injected into separate (0.4 x10 6 cells per mouse) into the teil vein of NSG mice (200μl in DMEM).
Optical imaging of Bioluminescence and/or Fluorescence was performed by using IVIS Spectrum or IVIS-200 imaging systems. 5-10 minutes prior to imaging, animals were injected i.p. with D-Luciferin (15 mg/ml in sterile saline) at a dose of 150 mg/kg (10 μL/g of body weight). After administration, animals were anesthetized using Isoflurane (1.5-2% delivered in 100% O2 at 1 l/min) and maintained via nosecone on heated imaging bed within the system for the duration of the scan. Following imaging, animals were allowed to recover on a heating blanket under observation and supplemented with oxygen as required.
Cells were treated with ABT737/S63845 (PC9 1.5/3 μM, A549 5/10 μM) 4-6h followed by wash and release into complete medium for 2 h, to generate PS. EasySep Dead Cell Removal (Annexin V) kit (Stemcell Technologies) was used to harvest live cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PT were stained with CFSE and PS with CTV label retention dye (Thermo Scienfic) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, washed twice in complete medium before further processing. Single injection tumor cell suspensions with combinations of PT and PS in Matrigel were prepared in one-milliliter syringes with 30-gauge hypodermic needles for an injection volume of 50 μl (2 x10 6 total cells per mouse). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in right lateral decubitus position. Local disinfection of the left posterior thorax was performed. Transdermal intrapulmonal injections have been performed at the posterior medial line juxta below the inferior angle of the scapula, through the intercostal space, 5-7 mm into the thorax. After injection mice were turned to the left lateral decubitus position and observed for approximately 15 min. Note: This non-surgical approach is comparable to the published surgical procedure for intrapulmonary injection ( Isobe et al., 2013 40. Isobe, T. ∙ Onn, A. ∙ Morgensztern, D. ...

For ex vivo processing of lungs to assess metastatic ratio, left (primary injection site) and right (metastatic side) lungs of animals were resected and kept separately in PBS. Tissue was minced using scissors and digested in trypsin supplemented with 100 μg/ml Liberase TM (Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 μg/ml Deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min incubation at 37°C 5% CO 2 . Organs were then resuspended in DMEM containing 5% FCS, pipetted up-and down and passed through a 40μM strainer.
Cells were stained for surface markers CD45-APC (in initial experiments also CD31-PECy7) for 20 minutes at 4°C. Erythrocyte lysis (NH 4 Cl 2 150mM, KHCO 3 10mM, EDTA 0.1mM, pH7.2) was performed at room temperature for 2 minutes. Cells were then washed in FACS Buffer (1g/l sodium azide, 10 g/l PBS powder, 2.5mM EDTA, 1% FCS in MilliQ filtered water) before FACS analysis.
For analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTC) 300 μl blood was collected from the right heart ventricle after mice had been euthanized and collected into vessels containing 30 μl of EDTA (Invitrogen). 100 μl of blood sample per mouse was stained for surface marker CD45-APC for 20 minutes at 4°C. Erythrocyte lysis (NH 4 Cl 2 150mM, KHCO 3 10mM, EDTA 0.1mM, pH7.2) was performed at room temperature for 2 minutes. Cells were then washed in FACS Buffer (1g/l sodium azide, 10 g/l PBS powder, 2.5mM EDTA, 1% FCS in MilliQ filtered water) before FACS analysis.
DNA and siRNA transient transfection was performed over 48 h using Viafect™ (Promega) for HEK, A549 and HT29, FugeneHD R (Promega) for PC9, A549 and HCT116 or Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Invitrogen) for any cell line, and Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX transfection reagents, respectively. Cells were transfected at 50–75% confluence in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturers’ instructions. The siRNA oligos used were either purchased from Dharmacon as ON-TARGETplus siRNA pools of 4 oligos or from IDT as single siRNAs (see Table S4 ).
For stable transfections, cells were transfected with a modified Piggybac expression system ( Magnúsdóttir et al., 2013 55. Magnúsdóttir, E. ∙ Dietmann, S. ∙ Murakami, K. ... A tripartite transcription factor network regulates primordial germ cell specification in mice Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15 :905-915 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ) for continuous expression. To remove the inducible expression promoter, we replaced the preexisting 6× Tet-Operators with a CMV promoter and placed the gene of interest under its control. Additionally, another variant of this backbone has been established by replacement of the puromycin resistance gene with zeocin or blasticidin resistance. Stable transfections were then performed by transfection of cells with the expression vector pPB together with a vector expressing the PiggyBac transposase which integrates the expression cassette. Stable transductants were selected after adding 200 μg/mL zeocin™ (Invitrogen), 0.2 μg/mL puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 20 μg/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen) with replacement of the medium every 2 days for max. 14 days or were sorted by flow cytometry for Cerulean-, Venus-, GFP-, or mCherry-positive cells.
Generation of knock out cells was performed by usage of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The different lentiviral vectors used are either carrying Cas9 sequence and sgRNA sequence (CRISPRv2 GFP, Addgene, a gift from David Feldser; Px458 pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP, Addgene, a gift from Feng Zhang, pSpCas9(BB)-2A-mCherry) or sgRNA carrying vectors (pLKO5.sgRNA.EFS.PAC, Addgene a gift from Benjamin Ebert) were transfected simultaneously with Cas9 expressing vectors mentioned above ( Heckl et al., 2014 34. Heckl, D. ∙ Kowalczyk, M.S. ∙ Yudovich, D. ... Generation of mouse models of myeloid malignancy with combinatorial genetic lesions using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :941-946 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ran et al., 2013 73. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat.

Systematic in vivo inactivation of chromatin-regulating enzymes identifies Setd2 as a potent tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma Cancer Res. 2017; 77 :1719-1729 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). The primer sequences for sgRNAs are listed in Table S3 ( Lopez et al., 2016 53. Lopez, J. ∙ Bessou, M. ∙ Riley, J.S. ... Mito-priming as a method to engineer Bcl-2 addiction Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10538 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shalem et al., 2014 79. Shalem, O. ∙ Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Hartenian, E. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells Science. 2014; 343 :84-87 Crossref Scopus (2911) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transiently transfected cells were selected after 0.2 μg/mL puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 20 μg/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen) with replacement of the medium every 2 days for max. 10 days or were sorted by flow cytometry for GFP-, or mCherry-positive cells. Single clones were selected and expanded to generate BAX, BAK, BOK triple knock-out cells and CYCS -deficient cells.
For intracellular staining cells were fixed and permeabilized according to the manufacturer's instructions using Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set (BD). To monitor Cytochrome c release, cells were incubated with 20μg/ml digitonin in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes on ice before fixation and further staining procedure. For nuclear staining of ATF4, the Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization (eBioscience) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Measurement of cellular lipid peroxidation was performed using BODIPY 581/591 C11 (Thermo Fisher). PT and PS have been treated in 12-well plates with 2μM RSL3 overnight in the presence or absence of 40 μM Deferoxamine mesylate salt (DFO). Cells were collected in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Gibco) and incubated with 2 μM BODIPY 581/591 C11 for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice in HBSS and analyzed via FACS.
Data acquirement and analysis was performed in a spectral analyzer (CYTEK Aurora 5-laser and 3-Laser) and data was processed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Cell-death kinetics were monitored by the IncuCyte S3 imaging system (Essen Bioscience). Dead cells were stained with 400 ng/ml propidium iodide (PI) or 25 nM SYTOX Green (Invitrogen). SYTOX Green- or PI- positive cells were quantified by the IncuCyte image analysis software (Essen Bioscience). Data were expressed as positive events per well. Error bars represent the SD from the mean for triplicate samples.
Cell-free (cytosolic) extracts were generated as previously described ( Liu et al., 1996 52. Liu, X. ∙ Kim, C.N. ∙ Yang, J. ... Induction of apoptotic program in cell-free extracts: requirement for dATP and cytochrome c Cell. 1996; 86 :147-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4405) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our studies we followed the detailed protocol that is provided by the Cold Spring Harbor Protocols ( McStay and Green, 2014 57. McStay, G.P. ∙ Green, D.R. Preparation of cytosolic extracts and activation of caspases by cytochrome c Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2014; 2014 :778-782 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ten 15cm dishes of confluent cells, were washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then scraped and harvested into 50ml conical tubes filled with ice-cold PBS. After centrifugation (at 250g for 5min. at 4°C), the supernatant has been removed and the pellet volume has been estimated. An equal volume of homogenization buffer (10mM HEPES pH7, 5mM MgCl 2 , 0.67 mM DTT, 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche)) has been used to completely resuspend the cells with a 1ml pipette tip. After an incubation of 15 min on ice, the cell suspension has been passed 10 times through a 22-gauge needle using a 3ml syringe. Testing aliquots of the lysate, this procedure has been repeated until more than 80% of nuclei stained blue in Trypan blue solution. Then, the homogenized cell suspension has been centrifuged at 15,000g for 30min 4°C in a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube, the supernatant has been transferred to a new tube, and the same centrifugation step has been repeated. Next, the supernatant has again been transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 100,000g for 1h 4°C. Finally, the supernatant has been passed through a 0.22μm centrifugal filter. Protein concentration has been determined by measuring absorbance at 280nm.
For kinetic analyses of eIF2α phosphorylation, HRI (25 nM) with or without 100nM Cytochrome c was incubated in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4, 40 mM KCl, 3 mM magnesium acetate and 1 mM DTT) at room temperature for 15 min. A titration of 0.05–12 μg eIF2α was prepared in assay buffer and supplemented with 50 μM ATP. The reaction was initiated by adding the substrate mix to the enzyme mix and then incubated at room temperature for 5 min (initial velocity conditions). The HRI kinase reaction rate using 25 nM HRI is linear for the first 20 min ( Figure S5 C) as previously published ( Guo et al., 2020 28. Guo, X. ∙ Aviles, G. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Mitochondrial stress is relayed to the cytosol by an OMA1–DELE1–HRI pathway Nature. 2020; 579 :427-432 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). The amount of reaction product (phosphorylated eIF2α) formed during the first 5 min was used as the initial velocity. Kinetic constants were determined using least-squares fit with Prism v.9.
mRNA for qRT-PCR were extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription reactions were performed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol and using random hexamers (IDT). The primer sequences for qPCR are listed in Table S5 ( Kim et al., 2010 43. Kim, K.-H. ∙ Jeong, J.-Y. ∙ Surh, Y.-J. ...

Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR™ Green using the QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Cells were either lysed in cell lysis buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, cOmplete® protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) or directly in sample buffer (BioRad) containing DTT. To detect phosphorylation, the cell lysis buffer was supplemented with phosSTOP® phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche).
A549 cells were transiently transfected with HRI-mClover or mClover constructs. 24 h after transfection cells were treated with ABT737 1.5μM, S6 3μM and QvD 20μM for 4 h, washed in ice-cold PBS, trypsinized and again washed in PBS, followed by an incubation in 2% PFA/PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature, turning end-to-end. Then samples were quenched in ice-cold glycine/PBS (0.7M) for 5 minutes at room temperature again turning end-to-end and afterwards washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Immunoprecipitation was performed using GFP-Trap_MA beads (Chromotek, gtma20) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lysis was performed in 10mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5, 80mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 substitute, Phosphatase-inhibitor (Roche) and EDTA-free Protease-inhibitor cocktail (Millipore Sigma). Lysate supernatants were incubated with beads at 4°C for 4h. Proteins captured on the magnetic beads were boiled in 2× SDS loading dye for 10 min before subjecting to SDS–PAGE and western blotting.
For in vitro incubation of HRI-mClover or mClover expressing A549 lysates with equine Cytochrome c, A549 cells were transiently transfected with constructs for 24h, washed in ice-cold PBS, trypsinized and again washed before lysis (same buffer as above). After lysis, supernatants were incubated with 100nm of equine Cytochrome c for 20 minutes at room temperature, followed by GFP-Trap_MA bead incubation at 4°C for 4h. IP was performed as described above.
For Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, PC9 APAF1 -/- cells were treated with ABT737 1.5 μM and S6 3 μM for 3.5h, then washed in ice-cold PBS, trypsinized and again washed. This was followed by an incubation in 2% PFA/PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature, turning end-to-end. Then samples were quenched in ice-cold glycine/PBS (0.7M) for 5 minutes at room temperature again turning end-to-end and afterwards washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Lysis was performed in 10mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5, 80mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 substitute, Phosphatase-inhibitor (Roche) and EDTA-free Protease-inhibitor cocktail (Millipore Sigma). Lysate supernatants were incubated with either anti-Cytochrome c antibody (BD #556432, 20 μg) or normal mouse IgG (sc-2025, 20 μg) at 4°C overnight, followed by 2h incubation with Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (sc-2003, Santa Cruz) at 4°C, and complexes were washed 5 times in cell lysis buffer. Proteins captured were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS loading dye for 10 min before subjecting to SDS–PAGE and western blotting.
PC9 cells were treated with ABT737 1.5 μM and S63845 3 μM for 6h and then washed and released in complete culture medium overnight (PS1D), 3 days (PS3D) or a week (PS7D) to obtain PS. EasySep Dead Cell Removal (Annexin V) kit (Stemcell Technologies) was used to harvest live cells from PT, PS1D, PS3D and PS7D according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The single cell suspension was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing at the concentration of 1200 cell/ μl. A total of 20000 cells were loaded into each well of a Chromium single cell capture chip (Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit, 10X Genomics). The captured single cells on droplets were processed for cell lysis, reverse transcription followed by library amplification (Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and gel Bead Kit v2, 10X Genomics) and indexing as per the manufactures protocol.
For comparison of different treatments of PC9 cells total RNA was extracted from PT or PS which were generated by treatment with ABT737 1.5 μM and S63845 3 μM for 6 h, or Erlotinib 5 μM for 3 d or Paclitaxel 0.5 μM for 3 d (n=3/group).
RNA quality was assessed by 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Nano assay (Agilent). Libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA kits (Illumina) and subjected to 100 cycle paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform.
The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq with 500 million clusters per library. Cell Ranger (10X Genomics) (version 6.0.1) was used to process the raw sequencing data and align the reads to the GRCh38 reference genome. The count matrix was filtered as follows. All mitochondrial and ribosomal protein genes were removed, as were any genes expressed in 0.15% cells or less per library. Genes expressed at high level similar to mitochondrial and ribosomal genes were also removed, including MALAT1, FTL and FTH1. Cells were removed by individual libraries based on the number of genes per cell, proportion of reads mapped to mitochondrial and ribosomal genes (see Table S2 for the threshold). Each library was normalized by dividing the UMI counts of each gene within a cell by the total number of UMIs in the cell and natural-log transformed using log1p function in R base package. A cell cycle score of each cell was calculated using CellCycleScoring function in Seurat package ( Stuart et al., 2019 85. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3429) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cell cycle genes ( Tirosh et al., 2016 93. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189 Crossref Scopus (1813) PubMed Google Scholar ). The libraries were down-sampled to the same number of cells (3753 cells), merged and scaled by number of genes, proportion of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes, and cell cycle phases S and G2M scores. Principal component analysis (PCA) was run on the scaled data. The cells were projected onto a 2-dimension space of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) using the first 40 principal components of PCA as input and the parameters a=200, b=0.4 (other parameters were defaulted).
Trajectory analysis was performed with Slingshot using UMAP projection as input, starting cells of PS1D sample, and approx_points=150 ( Street et al., 2018 84. Street, K. ∙ Risso, D. ∙ Fletcher, R.B. ... Slingshot: cell lineage and pseudotime inference for single-cell transcriptomics BMC Genomics. 2018; 19 :477 Crossref Scopus (513) PubMed Google Scholar ). The analysis of gene expression along the trajectory was performed with tradeSeq R package followed its official documentation with default parameters ( Van den Berge et al., 2020 95. Van den Berge, K. ∙ Roux de Bézieux, H. ∙ Street, K. ... Trajectory-based differential expression analysis for single-cell sequencing data Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1201 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ); 299 genes were differentially expressed along the pseudotime testing against 2-fold change (l2fc=1) identified using associationTest function. The genes were clustered using hierarchical clustering method with the modelled gene expression (centered and scaled) and cut into 4 clusters.
The gene set score measures the average gene expression level of given a gene set. It was calculated using AddModuleScore function of Seurat package with default parameters. The gene sets were defined based on bulk RNA-seq in this study ( Figure 7 N) or from MSigDB database ( Liberzon et al., 2015 50. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The molecular signatures database hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3180) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 O).
Paired-end sequencing reads were mapped by the pipeline of St Jude Center for Applied Bioinformatics. Basically, the reads were trimmed with Trim Galore (version 0.5.0) ( Krueger et al., 2021 45. Krueger, F., James, F., Ewels, P., Afyounian, E., Schuster-Boeckler, and B. (2021). TrimGalore, v0.6.7.(Zenodo). Google Scholar ) with default parameters. Then reads were aligned to the reference human hg38 assembly plus ERCC spike-in sequences using STAR (version 2.7.5a) ( Dobin and Gingeras, 2015 18. Dobin, A. ∙ Gingeras, T.R. Mapping RNA-seq reads with STAR Curr. Protoc. Bioinform. 2015; 51 :11.14.1-11.14.19 Crossref Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting alignments, recorded in BAM file, were sorted, indexed, and marked for duplicates with Picard MarkDuplicates function (version 2.19.0) ( Broad Institute, 2019 9. Broad Institute Picard toolkit 2019 http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ Google Scholar ). Transcript quantification was calculated using RSEM ( Li and Dewey, 2011 48. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (9676) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine if there is a global change in gene expression, RUVg function in RUVSeq package was used for normalization followed by DESeq2 with reads mapped ERCC spike-in according to RUVSeq manual ( Risso et al., 2014 76. Risso, D. ∙ Ngai, J. ∙ Speed, T.P. ... Normalization of RNA-seq data using factor analysis of control genes or samples Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :896-902 Crossref Scopus (810) PubMed Google Scholar ). No global change was found, and differential gene expression analysis was carried out using DESeq2 with standard procedure (normalized by the median-of-ratios method with default parameters ( Love et al., 2014 54. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-Seq data with DESeq2 Preprint at bioRxiv. 2014; Crossref Google Scholar ).
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed against MSigDB database ( Liberzon et al., 2015 50. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The molecular signatures database hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3180) PubMed Google Scholar ) with R package clusterProfiler (version 3.18.1) ( Yu et al., 2012 104. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.-G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes Among gene clusters Omics J. Integr. Biol. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (9510) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 J, 7 A, and S1 J). Wald statistic calculated from DESeq2 was used for gene ranking. Over-representation enrichment was performed against MSigDB with R package clusterProfiler (version 3.18.1) ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S2 F).
For HRI gene expression comparison between human normal and cancer samples we utilized RNA sequencing expression data of 9,736 tumors and 8,587 normal samples from the TCGA and the GTEx projects which were analyzed by the Webtool GEPIA2 ( Tang et al., 2019 91. Tang, Z. ∙ Kang, B. ∙ Li, C. ... GEPIA2: an enhanced web server for large-scale expression profiling and interactive analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W556-W560 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar ). Same datasets and software were used to determine disease free survival and overall survival in dependence of HRI expression in various tumors estimated by Mantel-Cox test ( Figures S7 D and S7E).
Gene expression, survival and clinical information of TCGA LUAD cohort were downloaded from UCSC Xena ( Goldman et al., 2020 25. Goldman, M.J. ∙ Craft, B. ∙ Hastie, M. ... Visualizing and interpreting cancer genomics data via the Xena platform Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :675-678 Crossref Scopus (766) PubMed Google Scholar ). EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinomas were filter by sample_type of “Primary tumor” and egfr_mutation_performed of “YES”. Gene expression RNAseq (IlluminaHiSeq) was used, in which the expression value is log 2 (x+1) where x is the RSEM value. Survival analysis was performed in R ( Figure 7 P).
Kaplan Meier Plots have been generated by use of the online webtool Kaplan-Meier Plotter with univariate Cox regression analysis. Patients have been trichotomized into 1 st and 4 th quartile for HRI (217735_s_at) expression using the GSE51105 dataset for gastric cancer ( Brasacchio et al., 2018 8.
