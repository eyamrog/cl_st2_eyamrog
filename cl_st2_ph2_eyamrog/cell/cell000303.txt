Title: G3BPs tether the TSC complex to lysosomes and suppress mTORC1 signaling


Abstract: Summary

Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and G3BP2, respectively) are widely recognized as core components of stress granules (SGs). We report that G3BPs reside at the cytoplasmic surface of lysosomes. They act in a non-redundant manner to anchor the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex to lysosomes and suppress activation of the metabolic master regulator mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids and insulin. Like the TSC complex, G3BP1 deficiency elicits phenotypes related to mTORC1 hyperactivity. In the context of tumors, low G3BP1 levels enhance mTORC1-driven breast cancer cell motility and correlate with adverse outcomes in patients. Furthermore, G3bp1 inhibition in zebrafish disturbs neuronal development and function, leading to white matter heterotopia and neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, G3BPs are not only core components of SGs but also a key element of lysosomal TSC-mTORC1 signaling.

Section: Introduction

The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) complex suppresses mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) ( Kim and Guan, 2019 63.

The TSC complex acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that inhibits the small GTPase RHEB (Ras homolog-mTORC1 binding) ( Garami et al., 2003 38. Garami, A. ∙ Zwartkruis, F.J. ∙ Nobukuni, T. ...

Suppression of mTORC1 by the TSC complex takes place at mTORC1’s central signaling platform, the lysosomes ( Demetriades et al., 2014 28. Demetriades, C. ∙ Doumpas, N. ∙ Teleman, A.A.

However, it is not yet clear how the TSC complex is recruited to lysosomes ( Kim and Guan, 2019 63. Kim, J. ∙ Guan, K.L. mTOR as a central hub of nutrient signalling and cell growth Nat.

We report that Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins (G3BPs) act as a lysosomal tether of the TSC complex under nutrient sufficiency and starvation. G3BP1 and G3BP2 are primarily recognized as RNA-binding proteins that constitute core components of stress granules (SGs) ( Alam and Kennedy, 2019 2. Alam, U. ∙ Kennedy, D.

In an MTOR interactome ( Schwarz et al., 2015 108. Schwarz, J.J. ∙ Wiese, H. ∙ Tölle, R.C. ...

Co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells corroborated that G3BP1 associates with MTOR, along with its interactors regulatory associated protein of MTOR complex 1 (RPTOR) and RPTOR independent companion of MTOR complex 2 (RICTOR) ( Figures 1 B and S1 B). Inhibitors of mTORC1 and its upstream activator AKT1 ( Kim and Guan, 2019 63. Kim, J. ∙ Guan, K.L. mTOR as a central hub of nutrient signalling and cell growth Nat.

Arsenite, a frequently used inducer of SGs ( Anderson et al., 2015 5. Anderson, P. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Ivanov, P. Stress granules, P-bodies and cancer Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1849 :861-870 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), elicited a cytoplasmic punctate pattern of G3BP1 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (EIF3A) ( Kedersha and Anderson, 2007 59. Kedersha, N. ∙ Anderson, P. Mammalian stress granules and processing bodies Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431 :61-81 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 E) and increased phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (EIF2S1) at S51 ( Figure 1 C), a marker for conditions that induce SGs ( Anderson and Kedersha, 2002 4. Anderson, P. ∙ Kedersha, N. Stressful initiations J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 :3227-3234 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). As reported earlier ( Heberle et al., 2019 46.

Commun. 1997; 238 :207-212 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), arsenite enhanced phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (RPS6KB1) ( Holz and Blenis, 2005 48. Holz, M.K. ∙ Blenis, J. Identification of S6 kinase 1 as a novel mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-phosphorylating kinase J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :26089-26093 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ) at T389 (RPS6KB1-pT389) ( Figures 1 C and 1E). G3BP1 knockdown did not alter RPS6KB1-pT389 levels ( Figures 1 C–1E and S1 F–S1K; Table S1 ), indicating that, in cells with SGs, G3BP1 does not affect mTORC1 activity.
We tested whether G3BP1 influences mTORC1 activity under conditions not associated with SG formation. Insulin and amino acids activate metabolic signaling through mTORC1 ( Menon et al., 2014 80.

Pende, M. ∙ Um, S.H. ∙ Mieulet, V. ... S6K1(-/-)/S6K2(-/-) mice exhibit perinatal lethality and rapamycin-sensitive 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA translation and reveal a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent S6 kinase pathway Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24 :3112-3124 Crossref Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 F, 1H, 1I, S1 L, S1N, and S1O). G3BP1 knockdown by two different short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences ( Table S1 ) further increased RPS6KB1-pT389 and RPS6-pS235/236 ( Figures 1 F–1I and S1 L–S1O). In triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, shG3BP1 knockdown also enhanced RPS6KB1-pT389 and RPS6-pS235/236 ( Figures 1 J–1M and S1 P–S1S). Similar results were obtained when targeting G3BP1 by two different CRISPR-Cas9 single guide sequences ( Table S1 ) in MCF-7 and HEK293T cells, respectively ( Figures 1 N–1Q and S1 T–S1V), and by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown in MCF-7 cells ( Figures S2 A–S2D). G3BP1 deficiency also increased RPS6KB1-T389 phosphorylation at later time points after stimulation ( Figures S2 E–S2G) and at steady state; i.e., in full ( Figures 1 R, 1S, and S2 H–S2M) and in starvation medium ( Figures S2 N–S2P). Thus, RPS6KB1-T389 phosphorylation is enhanced in G3BP1-deficient cells. The mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin prevented RPS6KB1-T389 hyperphosphorylation in G3BP1-deficient cells ( Figures 1 T–1V), showing it to be mediated by mTORC1. Re-expression of G3BP1 ( Figures 1 W and 1X) reversed RPS6KB1-T389 hyperphosphorylation in G3BP1 KO cells. We tested whether SGs were present in metabolically starved or stimulated cells ( Figures S2 Q and S2R). Arsenite served as a positive control. As expected, arsenite and amino acids + insulin enhanced mTORC1 activity ( Figures S2 S–S2X). Although arsenite induced SGs, no EIF3A puncta were visible in metabolically starved or stimulated cells ( Figures S2 Q and S2R). Thus, mTORC1 inhibition by G3BP1 under nutrient starvation and sufficiency occurs in the absence of SGs.
G3BP2 is highly similar to G3BP1 ( Figures S3 A and S3B; Kennedy et al., 2001 62. Kennedy, D. ∙ French, J. ∙ Guitard, E. ... Characterization of G3BPs: tissue specific expression, chromosomal localisation and rasGAP(120) binding studies J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 84 :173-187 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) and can substitute for G3BP1 in SG assembly ( Kedersha et al., 2016 60. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J.

Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation Genes Cells. 2013; 18 :135-146 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we wanted to find out whether G3BP2 also compensates for G3BP1 in mTORC1 signaling. G3BP2 knockdown enhanced RPS6KB1-pT389 and RPS6-pS235/236 ( Figures 2 A–2D). In agreement with prior data ( Kedersha et al., 2016 60. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ), G3BP2 expression was enhanced ∼3-fold in G3BP1 knockout (KO) cells ( Figures 2 E and 2F) but less so upon G3BP1 knockdown ( Figures 2 G and 2H). If G3BP1 and G3BP2 were redundant, then an increase in G3BP2 levels would suppress the effect of G3BP1 KO. Contrary to this hypothesis, we observed a similar increase in RPS6KB1-pT389 in G3BP1 KO and knockdown cells ( Figures 1 P and 1H), in which the levels of G3BP2 differ substantially ( Figures 2 E–2H). To further test the redundancy, we performed a rescue experiment ( Figures 2 I and 2J). Only G3BP1, but not G3BP2, suppressed RPS6KB1-T389 hyperphosphorylation in G3BP1 KO cells. Thus, G3BP2 cannot compensate for G3BP1 loss. CoIP ( Figure 2 K) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) ( Figures 2 L and 2M) showed that G3BP1 and G3BP2 bind to each other. BiFC detects protein-protein interactions at a maximum distance of 10 nm ( Hu et al., 2002 50. Hu, C.D. ∙ Chinenov, Y. ∙ Kerppola, T.K. Visualization of interactions among bZIP and Rel family proteins in living cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation Mol. Cell. 2002; 9 :789-798 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 C) and is indicative of close, likely direct contact. We conclude that G3BPs form a heterocomplex, which is in agreement with their non-redundancy in mTORC1 suppression.
To identify the subcellular compartment where G3BP1 and 2 act to inhibit mTORC1, we separated endosomal fractions of starved cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation ( Figures 3 A and 3B). In line with earlier biochemical and immunofluorescence (IF) studies ( Carroll et al., 2016 21. Carroll, B. ∙ Maetzel, D. ∙ Maddocks, O.D. ... Control of TSC2-Rheb signaling axis by arginine regulates mTORC1 activity eLife. 2016; 5 :e11058 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Demetriades et al., 2014 28.

Spatial control of the TSC complex integrates insulin and nutrient regulation of mTORC1 at the lysosome Cell. 2014; 156 :771-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ), TSC1, TSC2, and TBC1D7 resided in the lysosomal fractions. In the absence of SGs, G3BP1 exhibits a ubiquitous cytoplasmic localization ( Figure S2 Q; Irvine et al., 2004 56. Irvine, K. ∙ Stirling, R. ∙ Hume, D. ... Rasputin, more promiscuous than ever: a review of G3BP Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48 :1065-1077 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), but so far no specific subcellular enrichment has been identified. We found that G3BP1 and G3BP2 reside in the same fractions as the TSC complex ( Figures 3 A and 3B), predominantly distributing to fractions containing lysosomal markers. Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and cytoplasmic markers partially localized into the same fractions, suggesting that G3BPs reside at different subcellular locations. We further assessed their lysosomal localization by lysosome preparations (lyso-preps) ( Figure 3 C). Their purity was confirmed by enrichment of lysosomal and late endosomal markers and depletion of early endosomes and other organelles compared with the post-nuclear supernatant. We detected the G3BPs along with the TSC complex in the lyso-prep, indicative of their localization at late endosomes and/or lysosomes. In conjunction with sucrose density gradient fractionation (in which late endosomes segregate from lysosomes, the TSC complex and G3BP1/2) ( Figures 3 A and 3B), the lyso-prep allowed us to conclude that G3BPs localize to lysosomes. Proximity ligation assays (PLAs) ( Figures 3 D and 3E) confirmed in situ that G3BP1 resides close to the lysosomal protein lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), at a distance of less than 40 nm ( Debaize et al., 2017 27. Debaize, L. ∙ Jakobczyk, H. ∙ Rio, A.G. ... Optimization of proximity ligation assay (PLA) for detection of protein interactions and fusion proteins in non-adherent cells: application to pre-B lymphocytes Mol. Cytogenet. 2017; 10 :27 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trypsin protease treatment of the lyso-preps ( Figure 3 F) showed that the TSC complex and the G3BPs were degraded, whereas the luminal protein cathepsin D (CTSD) and LAMP1, whose largest portion is luminal with a short cytoplasmic stretch ( Eskelinen, 2006 32. Eskelinen, E.L. Roles of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 in lysosome biogenesis and autophagy Mol. Aspects Med. 2006; 27 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar ), were protected. Thus, G3BPs reside at the lysosomal surface along with the TSC complex.
Like TSC1 and TBC1D7, G3BPs co-immunoprecipitated with TSC2 ( Figure 3 G). Thus, the TSC complex physically interacts with G3BPs. PLAs supported the association of G3BP1 with TSC2 in situ ( Figures 3 H, 3I, S4 A, and S4B). G3BP1 was necessary for the TSC complex to act on MTOR as G3BP1 deficiency reduced the remaining TSC2-MTOR association ( Figures 3 J–3L) in nutrient-stimulated cells ( Huang et al., 2008 52. Huang, J. ∙ Dibble, C.C. ∙ Matsuzaki, M. ... The TSC1-TSC2 complex is required for proper activation of mTOR complex 2 Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28 :4104-4115 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020b 138. Yang, S. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ting, C.Y. ... The Rag GTPase Regulates the Dynamic Behavior of TSC Downstream of Both Amino Acid and Growth Factor Restriction Dev. Cell. 2020; 55 :272-288.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a likely scenario, G3BP1 may inhibit mTORC1 by mediating the lysosomal localization of the TSC complex. We tested this in IPs of TSC2, which co-immunoprecipitated LAMP1 and LAMP2 ( Figures 3 M and 3N). Indeed, G3BP1 deficiency reduced TSC2-LAMP1 interaction ( Figures 3 N–3Q). We next wanted to find out whether G3BP1 is required for lysosomal re-localization of the TSC complex in nutrient-starved versus -stimulated cells ( Carroll et al., 2016 21.

Endosomal sucrose gradient fractionation was not suitable for this purpose because the nutrient-induced shift of the TSC complex away from lysosomes was not detectable ( Figures S4 C and S4D). PLAs showed that TSC2-LAMP2 association was highest in starved cells and decreased upon stimulation with amino acids and insulin ( Figures 4 A and 4B). In starved cells, G3BP1 knockdown reduced TSC2-LAMP2 association to a similar level as observed upon insulin and amino acid stimulation. In agreement, G3BP1 KO reduced TSC2-LAMP1 co-localization in starved cells to the same extent as metabolic stimulation ( Figures 4 C and 4D). We propose that, in G3BP1-deficient cells, impaired lysosomal recruitment of the TSC complex under starvation enhances mTORC1 activity, which results in faster mTORC1 phosphorylation dynamics upon metabolic stimuli and higher overall activity at steady state. We also observed increased TSC2 phosphorylation at the AKT target site T1462 ( Figures S4 E and S4F), known to be involved in its dissociation from the lysosome ( Menon et al., 2014 80. Menon, S. ∙ Dibble, C.C. ∙ Talbott, G. ... Spatial control of the TSC complex integrates insulin and nutrient regulation of mTORC1 at the lysosome Cell. 2014; 156 :771-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ). As phosphorylation of AKT1 itself was not altered by G3BP1 deficiency ( Figure S4 G), lysosomal detachment may render the TSC complex more accessible to phosphorylation by AKT.
The TSC complex acts as a GAP on RHEB, and their interaction contributes to the lysosomal localization of the TSC complex ( Carroll et al., 2016 21. Carroll, B. ∙ Maetzel, D. ∙ Maddocks, O.D. ... Control of TSC2-Rheb signaling axis by arginine regulates mTORC1 activity eLife. 2016; 5 :e11058 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Menon et al., 2014 80. Menon, S. ∙ Dibble, C.C. ∙ Talbott, G. ... Spatial control of the TSC complex integrates insulin and nutrient regulation of mTORC1 at the lysosome Cell. 2014; 156 :771-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ). Are the mechanisms by which G3BP1 and RHEB target the TSC complex to lysosomes interdependent? G3BP1 KO and RHEB knockdown reduced TSC2-LAMP1 co-localization to a similar extent, and they did not have an additive effect ( Figures 4 C and 4D), showing that G3BP1 and RHEB are both necessary for lysosomal recruitment of the TSC complex. Thus, the association with its GTPase is not sufficient for lysosomal localization of the TSC complex and it requires G3BP1 as an additional tether.
Like the components of the TSC complex, we propose that G3BP1 and G3BP2 act non-redundantly on mTORC1. In further support of this, inhibition of G3BP1 alone was sufficient to phenocopy TSC2 deficiency because the effect sizes of G3BP1 ( Figures 1 R and 1S) and TSC2 ( Figures 4 E–4G) KO on RPS6KB1-pT389 were similar. Also, knockdowns with similar efficiencies for G3BP1 ( Figure 1 F-1H) and G3BP2 ( Figures 2 A–2C) had similar effect sizes on RPS6KB1-pT389 as a TSC2 knockdown ( Figures S4 H–S4J). Loss of the TSC complex increases cell size ( Figure S4 K; Gao and Pan, 2001 36. Gao, X. ∙ Pan, D.

Cells were also enlarged upon G3BP1 KO ( Figure 4 H), and the increase was similar to that observed for interference with TBC1D7 ( Dibble et al., 2012 30. Dibble, C.C. ∙ Elis, W. ∙ Menon, S. ... TBC1D7 is a third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1 Mol. Cell. 2012; 47 :535-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ) or TSC1 ( Potter et al., 2001 95. Potter, C.J. ∙ Huang, H. ∙ Xu, T.

Cell size regulation by the human TSC tumor suppressor proteins depends on PI3K and FKBP38 Oncogene. 2003; 22 :4786-4798 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). G3BP1 KO also phenocopied the effects of TSC2 deficiency ( Demetriades et al., 2014 28. Demetriades, C. ∙ Doumpas, N. ∙ Teleman, A.A. Regulation of TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation via lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 Cell. 2014; 156 :786-799 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ) in that lysosomal localization of MTOR was enhanced in starved cells ( Figures 4 I and 4J). Furthermore, G3BP1-deficient cells exhibited a more dispersed distribution of LAMP2 foci ( Figures S4 L and 4 J), mimicking the dispersed lysosomal pattern in TSC2-deficient cells ( Menon et al., 2014 80. Menon, S. ∙ Dibble, C.C. ∙ Talbott, G. ... Spatial control of the TSC complex integrates insulin and nutrient regulation of mTORC1 at the lysosome Cell. 2014; 156 :771-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, G3BP1 inhibition is sufficient to phenocopy loss of the TSC complex.
In an epistasis experiment, we analyzed the effect of G3BP1 inhibition on mTORC1 activity in the presence or absence of TSC2 ( Figures 4 K–4N). We had previously stimulated cells with insulin and amino acids because they both signal through the TSC complex ( Carroll et al., 2016 21. Carroll, B. ∙ Maetzel, D. ∙ Maddocks, O.D. ... Control of TSC2-Rheb signaling axis by arginine regulates mTORC1 activity eLife. 2016; 5 :e11058 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Demetriades et al., 2014 28.

Demetriades, C. ∙ Plescher, M. ∙ Teleman, A.A. Lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 is a universal response to cellular stress Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10662 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Amino acids also signal to mTORC1 via TSC complex-independent routes ( Liu and Sabatini, 2020 71. Liu, G.Y. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. mTOR at the nexus of nutrition, growth, ageing and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :183-203 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rabanal-Ruiz and Korolchuk, 2018 97. Rabanal-Ruiz, Y. ∙ Korolchuk, V.I. mTORC1 and Nutrient Homeostasis: The Central Role of the Lysosome Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19 :818 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). To exclusively assess mTORC1 inactivation via the TSC complex, we stimulated cells with insulin only. RPS6KB1-T389 was hyperphosphorylated to a similar extent in serum-starved or insulin-stimulated TSC2 KO cells because the TSC complex was absent. G3BP1 inhibition induced RPS6KB1-pT389 in control cells but not in TSC2 KO cells ( Figures 4 K and 4N). Thus, G3BP1 and the TSC complex act in the same pathway to suppress mTORC1.
Which TSC complex subunit mediates G3BP1 binding? TSC2 KO resulted in loss of G3BP1 from the TSC1-TBC1D7 complex ( Figure 5 A), indicating that G3BP1 binds TSC2. A C-terminal fragment of G3BP1 co-immunoprecipitated with TSC2-GFP to a similar extent as full-length G3BP1, whereas the middle part (with the proline-rich domain) and the N-terminal region (with the NTF2-like [NTF2L] domain) exhibited faint or no interaction ( Figure 5 B). Thus, the G3BP1 C terminus harboring the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and the arginine-glycine rich (RGG) repeats ( Tourrière et al., 2003 124. Tourrière, H. ∙ Chebli, K. ∙ Zekri, L. ... The RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease G3BP assembles stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160 :823-831 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 A) mediates binding to TSC2.
The TSC complex is resistant to high salt (1.5 M NaCl) and detergent (3.5 mM SDS), indicative of the high affinity between TSC1, TSC2, and TBC1D7 ( Dibble et al., 2012 30. Dibble, C.C. ∙ Elis, W. ∙ Menon, S. ... TBC1D7 is a third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1 Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274 :35647-35652 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, G3BP1 was lost at 0.5 M NaCl ( Figure 5 C), suggesting that its binding to the TSC complex requires electrostatic interactions. The G3BP1 C terminus harbors an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) ( Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020 43. Guillén-Boixet, J. ∙ Kopach, A. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ...

G3BP1 Is a Tunable Switch that Triggers Phase Separation to Assemble Stress Granules Cell. 2020; 181 :325-345.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), which, as is typical for IDRs ( Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013 33. Forman-Kay, J.D. ∙ Mittag, T. From sequence and forces to structure, function, and evolution of intrinsically disordered proteins Structure. 2013; 21 :1492-1499 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), contains a high density of positively charged arginine residues that mediate electrostatic interactions. G3BP1 binding was stable against denaturation by 3.5 mM SDS, a concentration that preferentially disrupts hydrophobic interactions ( Højgaard et al., 2018 47. Højgaard, C. ∙ Sørensen, H.V. ∙ Pedersen, J.S. ... Can a Charged Surfactant Unfold an Uncharged Protein? Biophys. J. 2018; 115 :2081-2086 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, upon exposure to SDS, G3BP1 retains high affinity to the TSC complex, in a range similar to the affinity between TSC1 and TSC2 ( Dibble et al., 2012 30. Dibble, C.C. ∙ Elis, W. ∙ Menon, S. ... TBC1D7 is a third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1 Mol. Cell. 2012; 47 :535-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the TSC complex and G3BP1 form a highly stable complex that requires electrostatic interactions, we deleted the RGG domain, which encompasses the C-terminal IDR of G3BP1 ( Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020 43. Guillén-Boixet, J. ∙ Kopach, A. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ...

G3BP1 Is a Tunable Switch that Triggers Phase Separation to Assemble Stress Granules Cell. 2020; 181 :325-345.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). TSC2 lost binding to G3BP1-ΔRGG ( Figure 5 D), demonstrating that the C-terminal IDR/RGG domain of G3BP1 interacts with TSC2.
We next assessed the proximity of the G3BP1 association with TSC2, the LAMP1/2 proteins, and MTOR by BiFC ( Figures 5 E, 5F, and S5 A). Cells that co-expressed G3BP1 with MTOR did not exhibit a BiFC signal. Thus, their interaction in IPs ( Figure 1 B) may not be direct but is possibly mediated by their common association with lysosomes. In contrast, BiFC signals for G3BP1 with LAMP1, LAMP2, and TSC2 were indicative of their close interaction. Similar results were obtained for G3BP2 ( Figures 5 G–5I and S5 B). Because G3BPs are at the lysosomal surface ( Figure 3 ), whereas LAMP proteins are mainly luminal with a short transmembrane and cytoplasmic portion, we wondered whether the latter is sufficient for binding. In line with this, G3BP1 and G3BP2 interacted with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (LAMP1 383–417 ) but not with the luminal part of LAMP1 (LAMP1 1–382 ) ( Figures 5 J–5M, S5 C, and S5D). Loss of its N-terminal NTF2L domain (G3BP1-ΔNTF2L) prevented G3BP1 from binding to LAMP2 ( Figure 5 N). Conversely, the NTF2L domain was sufficient to co-immunoprecipitate LAMP2 ( Figure 5 O). LAMP2 remained bound to a G3BP1 fragment devoid of the RGG domain ( Figure 5 N) that mediates TSC2 interaction. Thus, G3BP1 binds to TSC2 via its C-terminal RGG domain and to LAMP2 via its N-terminal NTF2L domain, bridging TSC2 to the LAMP proteins.
In view of the key function of G3BP1/2 in TSC-mTORC1 signaling, we analyzed their phylogenetic distribution ( Figure 5 P). While MTOR and RHEB are present in the yeast S. cerevisiae , G3BPs appeared together with the TSC complex in D. melanogaster and in the clade of Deuterostomia. G3BP1 orthologs have been proposed in S. cerevisiae ( Yang et al., 2014 136. Yang, X. ∙ Shen, Y. ∙ Garre, E. ... Stress granule-defective mutants deregulate stress responsive transcripts PLoS Genet. 2014; 10 :e1004763 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in C. elegans ( Jedrusik-Bode et al., 2013 57. Jedrusik-Bode, M. ∙ Studencka, M. ∙ Smolka, C. ... The sirtuin SIRT6 regulates stress granule formation in C. elegans and mammals J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :5166-5177 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequence analyses (Database: NCBI BLASTP nr database, BLOSUM45 matrix, 19.02.2020) showed that the human protein UNC80 (Genbank: XP_016859383.1 ) has the highest similarity to the proposed S. cerevisiae G3BP1 ortholog BRE5 (UniProt: P53741 ). Although the C. elegans protein GTBP-1 (UniProt: Q21351 ) has the highest similarities to human G3BP1/2, they are low (e values 4e−7 and 0.12) and restricted to the NTF2L and RRM domains, of which they cover 23%, not reaching the threshold for our phylogenetic analysis. Thus, G3BP1 and G3BP2 orthologs emerged together with the TSC complex.

Biol. 2006; 34 :473-480 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). G3BP1 deficiency also enhanced cell motility in a scratch assay, which was abrogated by rapamycin ( Figures 6 A and 6B). In line with prior reports ( Alam and Kennedy, 2019 2. Alam, U. ∙ Kennedy, D. Rasputin a decade on and more promiscuous than ever? A review of G3BPs Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol.

Winslow, S. ∙ Leandersson, K. ∙ Larsson, C. Regulation of PMP22 mRNA by G3BP1 affects cell proliferation in breast cancer cells Mol. Cancer. 2013; 12 :156 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), G3BP1 deficiency reduced proliferation ( Figures 6 C and 6D), confirming that the enhanced motility did not result from enhanced proliferation. Also in a Transwell migration assay ( Figures 6 E and 6F), G3BP1 KO cells exhibited enhanced migration. G3BP1 mRNA levels were similar in the four breast cancer subtypes ( Koboldt et al., 2012 66. Koboldt, D.C. ∙ Fulton, R.S. ∙ McLellan, M.D. ..., Cancer Genome Atlas Network Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours Nature. 2012; 490 :61-70 Crossref Scopus (6476) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 6 G). Patients with G3BP1 mRNA or protein levels below the median exhibited shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) ( Figure 6 H, I), reminiscent of the shorter RFS in patients with low TSC1 or TSC2 ( Figures 6 J and 6K). Thus, G3BP1 and the TSC complex could be subtype-independent indicators of mTORC1 activity and cancer cell motility.
Loss of the TSC complex ( Switon et al., 2017 114. Switon, K. ∙ Kotulska, K. ∙ Janusz-Kaminska, A. ...

Similarly, g3bp1 morphants showed increased numbers of Rps6-pS235/236-positive cells ( Figures 7 E and 7F), many of which resided in the WM ( Figures 7 G and 7H). Twice as many neuronal progenitors migrated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) to outer brain layers ( Figures S6 C, S6D, and 7 I). Although they exhibited similar velocity ( Figure 7 J), movement duration was prolonged ( Figure 7 K). Thus, aberrant migration dynamics may underlie neuron mislocalization to the WM in g3bp1 morphants. Non-invasive recordings of local field potentials (LFP) detect aberrant neuronal activity in epilepsy-related zebrafish models ( Baraban et al., 2013 11. Baraban, S.C. ∙ Dinday, M.T. ∙ Hortopan, G.A.

LFP recordings from the pallia ( Figure 7 L, 7M, and S6 E) and optic tecta ( Figures 7 N, 7O, and S6 F) revealed neuronal hyperactivity in g3bp1 morphants, which was suppressed by rapamycin. At the single-cell level, increased numbers of active cells resided in the pallium ( Figure S6 B, 7 P, and 7Q; Videos S1 and S2 ). While the mean neuronal activity in the subpallium was unchanged ( Figure 7 R), it was increased significantly in the WM of the pallium ( Figure 7 S). At the single-cell level, rapamycin also suppressed neuronal hyperactivity ( Figure 7 T). Neuronal network hyperactivity can result from imbalanced glutamatergic and GABAergic networks ( Bozzi et al., 2018 17. Bozzi, Y. ∙ Provenzano, G. ∙ Casarosa, S.

Defective Excitatory/Inhibitory Synaptic Balance and Increased Neuron Apoptosis in a Zebrafish Model of Dravet Syndrome Cells. 2019; 8 :1199 Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar ). g3bp1 morphants showed a severe reduction of GABAergic neurons and a lesser reduction of glutamatergic neurons ( Figures 7 U, 7V, and S6 B). Thus, an imbalance of GABAergic and glutamatergic networks may contribute to neuronal hyperactivity. In Tsc2-deficient zebrafish, anatomical changes and neuronal hyperexcitability are associated with non-motor seizures manifesting as decreased locomotor activity ( Kedra et al., 2020 61.

Section: Discussion

G3BP1 was originally identified as a RasGAP-binding protein ( Gallouzi et al., 1998 35. Gallouzi, I.E. ∙ Parker, F. ∙ Chebli, K. ...

A Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3-domain-binding protein Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16 :2561-2569 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). A role in the RAS pathway was proposed but later questioned ( Annibaldi et al., 2011 7. Annibaldi, A. ∙ Dousse, A. ∙ Martin, S. ... Revisiting G3BP1 as a RasGAP binding protein: sensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapy by the RasGAP 317-326 sequence does not involve G3BP1 PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e29024 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We demonstrate that G3BP1’s assignment as a GAP-binding protein was correct, although for a different GAP, because it exerts this role by binding TSC2. It may be rewarding to revisit whether G3BPs bind to other RAS-related GAPs. In the insulin-mTORC1 axis, G3BP1 exerts its suppressor function through the TSC complex, but other GAPs may mediate the G3BPs’ roles in RAS ( Parker et al., 1996 92. Parker, F. ∙ Maurier, F. ∙ Delumeau, I. ... A Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3-domain-binding protein Mol. Cell.

We have shown earlier that, in the presence of G3BP1-containing SGs, the sperm associated antigen 5 (SPAG5)-RPTOR complex decreases mTORC1 activity ( Thedieck et al., 2013 121. Thedieck, K. ∙ Holzwarth, B. ∙ Prentzell, M.T. ... Inhibition of mTORC1 by astrin and stress granules prevents apoptosis in cancer cells Cell. 2013; 154 :859-874 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we report that, in the absence of SGs, G3BP1 tethers the TSC complex to lysosomes. Why does G3BP1 inhibit mTORC1 upon metabolic starvation and sufficiency but not upon SG formation? Upon stress, activating ( Heberle et al., 2019 46. Heberle, A.M. ∙ Razquin Navas, P. ∙ Langelaar-Makkinje, M. ...

Although it is tempting to speculate that G3BP1, as a SG nucleator, contributes to SG-mediated mTORC1 inhibition ( Thedieck et al., 2013 121. Thedieck, K. ∙ Holzwarth, B. ∙ Prentzell, M.T. ...

Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation Genes Cells. 2013; 18 :135-146 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our own results ( Figures S2 Q and S2R) show that G3BP1 inhibition alone does not prevent SG formation. SG-inducing agents enhance TSC2 degradation ( Heberle et al., 2019 46. Heberle, A.M. ∙ Razquin Navas, P. ∙ Langelaar-Makkinje, M. ... The PI3K and MAPK/p38 pathways control stress granule assembly in a hierarchical manner Life Sci. Alliance. 2019; 2 e201800257 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thedieck et al., 2013 121.

Inhibition of mTORC1 by astrin and stress granules prevents apoptosis in cancer cells Cell. 2013; 154 :859-874 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Without TSC2, G3BP1 cannot bind to the TSC complex ( Figure 5 A) and, thus, cannot inhibit mTORC1. To conclude, upon SG formation, the TSC complex is reduced, and SG are not affected by G3BP1 deficiency; thus, neither mechanism can affect mTORC1 in a G3BP1-dependent manner.
Can the lysosomal localization of G3BPs be reconciled with functions in SGs and other subcellular compartments? SGs hitchhike on lysosomes ( Liao et al., 2019 69. Liao, Y.C. ∙ Fernandopulle, M.S. ∙ Wang, G. ... RNA Granules Hitchhike on Lysosomes for Long-Distance Transport, Using Annexin A11 as a Molecular Tether Cell. 2019; 179 :147-164.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may enable G3BPs to switch between their SG and lysosomal functions. G3BP1’s ubiquitous cytoplasmic distribution ( Figure S2 Q; Irvine et al., 2004 56. Irvine, K. ∙ Stirling, R. ∙ Hume, D. ... Rasputin, more promiscuous than ever: a review of G3BP Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48 :1065-1077 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ) is reminiscent of the IF patterns for the TSC complex ( Carroll et al., 2016 21. Carroll, B. ∙ Maetzel, D. ∙ Maddocks, O.D. ...

Regulation of TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation via lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 Cell. 2014; 156 :786-799 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ) and MTOR ( Betz and Hall, 2013 12. Betz, C. ∙ Hall, M.N. Where is mTOR and what is it doing there? J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203 :563-574 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ), which also localize to multiple subcellular sites ( Betz and Hall, 2013 12. Betz, C. ∙ Hall, M.N. Where is mTOR and what is it doing there? J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203 :563-574 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2013 143. Zhang, J. ∙ Kim, J. ∙ Alexander, A. ... A tuberous sclerosis complex signalling node at the peroxisome regulates mTORC1 and autophagy in response to ROS Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15 :1186-1196 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, G3BPs may be relevant for TSC complex and mTORC1 function beyond lysosomes.
What can we conclude regarding the relevance of G3BP1 in cancer and neuronal disease? Its dual roles in oncogenic mTORC1 signaling and SG formation argue against G3BP1 as an anti-tumor drug target, as proposed by others ( Alam and Kennedy, 2019 2. Alam, U. ∙ Kennedy, D.

G3BP1 inhibition is not sufficient to inhibit SG ( Figures S2 Q and S2R; Kedersha et al., 2016 60. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ...

G3BP1 may, however, be a promising marker associated with mTORC1 hyperactivity, which correlates with tumor sensitivity to mTORC1 inhibitors ( Grabiner et al., 2014 42.

Whether disturbed function of G3BP1/2 in the TSC-mTORC1 axis contributes to the etiology of neuronal diseases also deserves evaluation. We scrutinized Genomics England (GEL) 100,000 Genomes Project data for mutations in G3BP1/2. 100 individuals had a clinical diagnosis of TSC disease with no pathogenic TSC1 or TSC2 variant, which is the most frequent cause of the disease ( Borkowska et al., 2011 16.

Orlova, K.A. ∙ Crino, P.B. The tuberous sclerosis complex Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2010; 1184 :87-105 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, none of the 100 individuals showed likely pathogenic changes in G3BP1 / 2 . Extending the analysis to all variants at the G3BP1 or G3BP2 loci in the GEL rare disease data (64,185 whole-genome sequences) identified nine individuals with unexplained, mostly neurological phenotypes and heterozygous variants in G3BP1 or G3BP2 strongly predicted to alter protein function ( Table S2 ). A further G3BP1 loss-of-function variant was noted in the Epi4K cohort of individuals with epilepsy (Table S1 in Appenzeller et al., 2014 8. Appenzeller, S. ∙ Balling, R. ∙ Barisic, N. ..., EuroEPINOMICS-RES Consortium, Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project, Epi4K Consortium De novo mutations in synaptic transmission genes including DNM1 cause epileptic encephalopathies Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2014; 95 :360-370 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). Six of the variants were apparently unique, being absent from gnomAD ( https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/ ), and four were present at extremely low allele frequencies. We conclude that G3BP1 and G3BP2 are unlikely to represent further genes determining the TSC disease phenotype. The numbers of observations in other neurological diseases were too small to statistically confirm or refute associations that will need to be addressed in larger and more specific cohorts. Interestingly, certain mutations of the TSC2 GAP domain that result in only partial loss of function and mutations of TBC1D7 also lead to neurological phenotypes that are clinically distinct to definite TSC disease ( Alfaiz et al., 2014 3.

Mutations of these and further genes resulting in mTORC1 hyperactivation are linked with neuronal phenotypes, collectively referred to as “mTORopathies” ( Crino, 2015 24. Crino, P.B. mTOR signaling in epilepsy: insights from malformations of cortical development Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

(Editors) Jasper’s Basic Mechanisms of the Epilepsies Oxford University Press, 2012; 1241-1254 Crossref Google Scholar ). Future studies will shed light on whether G3BP1 and G3BP2 belong to this family. We advocate in-depth evaluation of the etiological and therapeutic relevance of G3BPs to cancer and neuronal disorders.
Another important question concerns the role of the G3BPs in the lysosomal dissociation of the TSC complex in response to insulin ( Menon et al., 2014 80. Menon, S. ∙ Dibble, C.C. ∙ Talbott, G. ... Spatial control of the TSC complex integrates insulin and nutrient regulation of mTORC1 at the lysosome Cell. 2014; 156 :771-785 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ) or amino acids ( Carroll et al., 2016 21.

The custom Python scripts for the phylogenetic analysis are accessible via https://github.com/MolecularBioinformatics/Phylogenetic-analysis and were manually curated as described earlier ( Bockwoldt et al., 2019 15. Bockwoldt, M. ∙ Houry, D. ∙ Niere, M. ... Identification of evolutionary and kinetic drivers of NAD-dependent signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :15957-15966 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The bash script to identify the single nucleotide variants (SNV) within G3BP1 and G3BP2 is provided in Document S3 . The script was adapted from the ‘extract_variants_by_coordinate.sh’ script for germline variants ( https://research-help.genomicsengland.co.uk/display/GERE/Extract+variants+by+coordinate ) and was run on the command line within the Genomics England Research environment using bcftools ( https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/ ).
Experiments were performed in HeLa alpha Kyoto cells ( Thedieck et al., 2007 120. Thedieck, K. ∙ Polak, P. ∙ Kim, M.L. ... PRAS40 and PRR5-like protein are new mTOR interactors that regulate apoptosis PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 :e1217 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ), MCF-7 cells (ACC115), MCF-7 cells expressing GFP-LC3 (MCF-7-LC3), MDA-MB-231, HEK293T, and HEK293-β 2 AR cells. All cells, except for HEK293-β 2 AR ( Lavoie et al., 2002 68. Lavoie, C. ∙ Mercier, J.F. ∙ Salahpour, A. ... Beta 1/beta 2-adrenergic receptor heterodimerization regulates beta 2-adrenergic receptor internalization and ERK signaling efficacy J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :35402-35410 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ), were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g / L glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 3 mM L-glutamine (termed full medium) if not indicated otherwise. HEK293-β 2 AR were cultured in DMEM with 4.5 g / L glucose and 0.584 mM L-glutamine, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator and regularly tested for mycoplasma infection.
siRNA knockdown of G3BP1, G3BP2 and RHEB was induced for two days using ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA at a final concentration of 40 nM. siRNA knockdown of TSC2 was induced for two days using ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA at a final concentration of 5 nM. As a negative control, a non-targeting scrambled siRNA pool (siControl) was used at the same concentration. siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 or RNAiMAX transfection reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The medium containing the transfection mix was replaced 6 hours after transfection. For PLA analysis in Figure 4 A, siRNA knockdown of G3BP1 was induced for five days using siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA at a final concentration of 15 nM. Here siRNA against Renilla luciferase (Control) was used as a control.
Doxycyclin-inducible shRNA knockdown cell lines for G3BP1 were generated using the pTRIPZ system with the Trans-Lentiviral shRNA Packaging Mix (Horizon Discovery). Viral particles were produced using shRNA constructs targeting G3BP1 (shG3BP1 #1 or shG3BP1 #2) or a non-targeting scrambled control sequence (shControl) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. MCF-7-LC3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced in three rounds. The cells were incubated with the viral supernatant containing 8 μg / mL polybrene for 16 hours, followed by 6 hours of fresh full medium. Antibiotic selection was carried out 48 hours post-transduction with 2 μg / mL puromycin for 7 days. Expression of the shRNA was induced with 2 μg / mL doxycycline for 4 days. Monoclonal cell populations were obtained by limiting dilutions. Knockdown efficiency was tested at protein level by immunoblotting.
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines for G3BP1 and TSC2 were generated using a two-vector system as previously described ( Sanjana et al., 2014 103. Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Shalem, O. ∙ Zhang, F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :783-784 Crossref Scopus (1793) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, doxycyclin-inducible Cas9 expressing MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines were generated by lentiviral transduction using the pCW-Cas9-Blast vector (Addgene plasmid # 83481) and thereafter selected with 5 μg / mL blasticidin for 48 hours, as described previously ( Shalem et al., 2014 110. Shalem, O. ∙ Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Hartenian, E. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells Science. 2014; 343 :84-87 Crossref Scopus (2340) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, the Cas9 expressing cells were transduced with the lentiGuide-Puro vector (Addgene plasmid # 52963) containing either no sgRNA (control), or sgRNA (sgRNA #1) targeting G3BP1 (G3BP1 KO) or TSC2 (TSC2 KO). These cells were selected with 2 μg / mL puromycin for 48 hours. Monoclonal cell populations were obtained by limiting dilutions. Cas9 expression was induced with 2 μg / mL doxycycline for 48 hours. Knockout efficiency was tested at protein level by immunoblotting.
Using a second independent sgRNA (sgRNA #2) G3BP1 was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 in HEK293T cells ( Figures S1 T–S1V) with the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 vector (Addgene plasmid # 62988). The sgRNA #2 was cloned as previously described ( Ran et al., 2013 98. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (4487) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s protocols and selected with 2 μg / mL puromycin for 48 hours. Monoclonal cell populations were obtained by limiting dilutions. Knockout efficiency was tested at protein level by immunoblotting.
If not indicated otherwise, G3BP1 knockout was performed using sgRNA #1. All different siRNA, shRNA and sgRNA sequences targeting G3BP1 are shown in Table S1 . Table S5 lists all commercially available siRNAs and shRNAs used in this study.
Adult Wistar Cmd:(WI)WU rats were obtained from the Mossakowski Medical Research Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences (Breeder no: 004) and kept in standard housing conditions with ad libitum access to food and water. To obtain brain tissue for immunoprecipitation, the rats were sacrificed according to protocol, which complied with the Republic of Poland Act of 15 December 2015 on the protection of animals used for scientific or educational purposes and the European Community Council Directive 2010/63/EU.
Adult zebrafish of the AB (Zebrafish International Resource Center), Tg ( dlx5a/dlx6a-EGFP ) ( Noble et al., 2015 88. Noble, S. ∙ Godoy, R. ∙ Affaticati, P. ...

Whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution using light-sheet microscopy Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :413-420 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ) strain were maintained under standard aquaculture conditions in UV-sterilized water at 28.5°C on a 14 hour light / 10 hour dark cycle.
Fertilized eggs were collected via natural spawning. Embryos and larvae were raised in embryo medium, containing 1.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 17.4 mM NaCl, 0.21 mM KCl, 0.12 mM MgSO4 and 0.18 mM Ca(NO 3 ) 2 in an incubator on a 14 hour light / 10 hour dark cycle at 28.5°C. For all experiments described, larvae at 0-4 days post fertilization (dpf) were used. All experiments performed at the University of Leuven were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Leuven (Ethische Commissie van de KU Leuven, approval number 150/2015) and by the Belgian Federal Department of Public Health, Food Safety and Environment (Federale Overheidsdienst Volksgezondheid, Veiligheid van de Voedselketen en Leefmilieu, approval number LA1210199). All experiments performed at the International Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology in which zebrafish embryos and larvae were used were conducted in accordance with the Act of 15 January 2015 on the protection of animals used for scientific and educational purposes, Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and were approved by Institutional Animal Welfare Advisory Team at the International Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology in Poland.
To achieve knockdown of g3bp1 in zebrafish embryos, we used morpholino antisense oligonucleotides designed to target the Exon 2 – Intron 2 boundary of the g3bp1 mRNA ( g3bp1 MO). The morpholino sequence, as synthesized by GeneTools was: 5′-TAACAAAGGGCAAGTCACCTGTGCA-3′. A fluoresceinated standard control (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) with a 3′ fluorescein group was used as a negative control (control MO). Embryos were microinjected at the one- or two-cell stage with 1 nL of either g3bp1 or control MO, corresponding to 8 ng of morpholino per injection. For the knockdown of tsc2 the morpholino sequence 5′-CTGTGTGTTTTCTTACTGGACCATA-3′ was used targeting the Exon 1 – Intron 1 boundary of the tsc2 mRNA ( tsc2 MO). Embryos were microinjected at the one- or two-cell stage with 2.5 ng of tsc2 splice MO per injection. The same amount of control MO was used. The morpholino concentration used was defined by titration as the highest at which the larvae displayed no morphological abnormalities. At 3-4 hours after injections, staging was performed to assure the same age of the eggs in all groups.
SG formation was induced with arsenite at a final concentration of 500 μM for the indicated time periods. Prior to arsenite stress, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum-starved for 16 hours.
Metabolic stimulation experiments: for serum and amino acid starvation, cells were washed in PBS and cultured for 16 hours in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). For stimulation with insulin and amino acids (insulin / aa), the medium was exchanged to DMEM supplemented with 3 mM L-glutamine and 100 nM insulin. 1 μM insulin was used for stimulation in Figures 4 A and 4C.
For serum starvation, cells were washed in PBS and cultured for 16 hours in DMEM with 4.5 g / L glucose, supplemented with 3 mM L-glutamine. For stimulation with insulin alone ( Figure 4 K), insulin was directly added to the serum-free media for the time periods indicated.
Lyophilized rapamycin was dissolved in methanol to a concentration of 1 nmol / μL and aliquoted to 5 μL per tube. 5 μL aliquots were dried with open lids under a sterile cell culture hood and deep frozen at –80°C. Aliquots were thawed immediately before an experiment and methanol-dried rapamycin was directly dissolved in HBSS or DMEM to a final concentration of 20 or 100 nM, as indicated. Hence, no carrier was used in experiments with rapamycin. Rapamycin pretreatments in Figures 1 T and S1 C started 30 min prior to stimulation or lysis, respectively.
Torin1 and MK2206 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to full DMEM medium to a final concentration of 250 nM and 10 nM, respectively. Torin1 or MK2206 were added 30 min prior to lysis ( Figure S1 D).
450,000 MCF-7 control and 650,000 G3BP1 KO cells were seeded in 60 mm dishes 24 hours prior to transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with 4 μg of either a MYC-FLAG-empty vector, MYC-FLAG-G3BP1 or MYC-FLAG-G3BP2 using JetPEI following the manufacturer’s protocol. On the next day, the cells were washed once with PBS and cultured for 16 hours in HBSS. For metabolic stimulation, the medium was exchanged to DMEM supplemented with 3 mM L-glutamine and 100 nM insulin for 15 min.
Cell size was measured and analyzed with a Casy electronic cell counter, following the manufacturer’s protocol. In short, 2.5 × 10 5 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 hours of culture, cells were trypsinized and taken up in full DMEM. Each cell line was measured twice; each measurement comprised three cycles of cell counts with intervals of 0.05 μm ranging from 0 to 50 μm. The sum of counts of viable cells in the range of 12 to 30 μm was plotted and quantified. Three biological replicates were performed per MDA-MB-231 cell line (KO and corresponding Control). Control and corresponding KO were compared with multiple unpaired t tests. p values are presented as stars above the corresponding bar graphs. ∗ , p < 0.05.
The coding sequences (CDS) of G3BP1, G3BP2, LAMP1 and LAMP2 were obtained from the clone repository of the DKFZ Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility (GPCF) as Gateway® compatible clones in pENTR221 or pENTR223. The CDS of MTOR and TSC2 were gifts from Dominic Esposito (Addgene plasmids # 70422 and # 70640) and obtained as Gateway® compatible clones in pDonor-255. All CDS were generated with and without STOP-codon in the Gateway-frame. If only one CDS cloning was successful in first instance, the cloning of the second was performed on the successful one and pDONR223 was used as ENTRY clone to reduce background by changing E.coli resistance from kanamycin to spectinomycin. After sequence verification, the CDS without STOP-codon were cloned into the BiFC destination vectors pGW-MYC-LC151 for G3BP1, G3BP2, and LAMP1, and pGW-HA-LN151 for G3BP1, G3BP2, LAMP1, LAMP2, MTOR and TSC2 by Gateway®-specific LR-reaction following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Previously, the vectors bFos-MYC-LC151 and bJun-HA-LN151 ( Chu et al., 2009 22. Chu, J. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Zheng, Y. ... A novel far-red bimolecular fluorescence complementation system that allows for efficient visualization of protein interactions under physiological conditions Biosens. Bioelectron. 2009; 25 :234-239 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) were adapted for Gateway cloning. MYC-LC151 and HA-LN151 PCR-fragments were generated and cloned into modified pDEST26 vectors resulting in pGW-MYC-LC151 and pGW-HA-LN151, as previously described ( Weiler et al., 2014 129. Weiler, M. ∙ Blaes, J. ∙ Pusch, S. ... mTOR target NDRG1 confers MGMT-dependent resistance to alkylating chemotherapy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :409-414 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the Gateway®-specific LR reaction, TSC2 and LAMP2 were also cloned into pEGFP-C (TSC2-GFP and LAMP2-GFP). Three G3BP1 truncation constructs in pGW-MYC-LC151 were generated with primers placed at the end or start positions of each construct, respectively: G3BP1 1-182 -MYC, G3BP1 183-332 -MYC and G3BP1 333-466 -MYC. AttB sites were added to the CDS by a two-step PCR. The first PCR was performed with hybrid primers, consisting of half of the AttB sites and the other half being gene specific. The second PCR was done with primers covering the complete AttB sites (see Table S4 for primer details). Following the same principle also a LAMP1 1-382 lysosomal truncation construct was generated resulting in pGW-MYC-LC151-LAMP1 1-382 . Since the cytoplasmic domain of LAMP1 is very small, we fused it to turboGFP (tGFP). We therefore added the restriction sites for BamHl and Xhol in pDONR201-tGFP. LAMP1 383-417 was amplified with primers adding the restriction sites of BglII and SalI, and subsequently cloned into pDONR201-tGFP via one tube ligation. After sequence verification tGFP-LAMP1 383-417 was cloned into the BiFC destination vector resulting in pGW-MYC-LC151-LAMP1 383-417 by Gateway®-specific LR-reaction. The respective primers can be found in Table S4 .
G3BP1 was amplified by PCR using cDNA from HeLa S3 cells as template, and inserted into pCMV6-AN-MYC-DDK (MYC-FLAG-empty) by restriction cloning using AsiSI and MluI. MYC-FLAG-G3BP1-ΔRGG (lacking amino acids 410-466), MYC-FLAG-G3BP1-ΔNTF2L (lacking amino acids 1-139) and MYC-FLAG-G3BP1-NTF2L (amino acids 1-139) constructs were generated by Site-Directed Mutagenesis using Phusion HF DNA Polymerase and the vector pCMV6-AN-MYC-DDK containing G3BP1 (MYC-FLAG-G3BP1) as template. G3BP2 was amplified by PCR using pGW-MYC-LC151-G3BP2 (see above) as template, and inserted into pCMV6-AN-Myc-DDK (MYC-FLAG-G3BP2) by restriction cloning using AsiSI and MluI.
All plasmids were verified with restriction digest and Sanger sequencing.
For lysis, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 and Cocktail 3. The protein concentration was measured using Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate and adjusted to the lowest value. Cell lysates were mixed with sample buffer (10% glycerol, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol, 1.7% SDS, 62.5 mM TRIS base [pH 6.8], and bromophenol blue), and heated for 5 min at 95°C. Cell lysates were then loaded on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels with a concentration of 8%, 10%, 12% or 14% polyacrylamide. Polyacrylamide gels were prepared consisting of two distinct layers: a stacking and a separation gel. For the lower separation gel, polyacrylamide was diluted to the respective percentage with 375 mM TRIS base [pH 8.8]. For the upper stacking gel, polyacrylamide was mixed with 0.125 M TRIS base [pH 6.8] to a final concentration of 13%. Electrophoresis was carried out with a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Vertical Electrophoresis Cell system that was filled with electrophoresis buffer (0.2 M glycine, 25 mM TRIS base, and 0.1% SDS), and an applied voltage of 90 to 150 V. Subsequently, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Vertical Electrophoresis Cell system filled with blotting buffer (0.1 M glycine, 50 mM TRIS base, 0.01% SDS, [pH 8.3], and 10% methanol) and an applied voltage of 45 V for 2 hours. Afterward, membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) – TRIS-buffered saline tween (TBST) buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 60 mM TRIS base, 3 mM KCl, and 0.1% Tween-20, [pH 7.4]). Membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C, following the manufacturer’s instructions for the respective antibodies (antibody dilutions can be found in Table S3 ). The next day, membranes were washed in TBST buffer and incubated for at least one hour with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP) coupled secondary antibodies. For detection, Pierce ECL western blotting substrate or SuperSignal West FEMTO were used to detect chemiluminescence using a LAS-4000 camera system, a ChemiDoc XRS+ camera or a Fusion Fx camera. For graphical presentation, raw images taken with the LAS-4000 or Fusion camera were exported as RGB color TIFF files using ImageJ version 1.50b ( Schneider et al., 2012 107. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (24410) PubMed Google Scholar ), and further processed with Adobe Photoshop version CS5.1. Raw images taken with a ChemiDoc XRS+ camera were processed with Image Lab version 5.2.1 and exported for publication as TIFF files with 600 dpi resolution. Numbers on the right of each single immunoblot indicate the kilodalton (kDa) size of the nearest protein ladder signal.

For IP experiments, cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and then harvested in CHAPS based IP lysis buffer (40 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, [pH 7.5] and 0.3% CHAPS) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 and Cocktail 3. The lysate volume was adjusted to 1 - 2.5 mL per 15 cm cell culture plate, depending on the cell density. The lysate was incubated under gentle agitation for 20 min at 4°C, centrifuged for 3 min at 600 g at 4°C, the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes. In case of multiple samples, the protein concentration was measured using Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate and all samples were adjusted to the lowest value. The lysates were pre-incubated with 10 μL pre-washed Protein G covered Dynabeads per mL of lysate for 30 min at 4°C under gentle agitation. A fraction of each lysate was mixed with 5 x sample buffer, referred to as ‘lysate’ input in the figure panels. For IP, the pre-cleaned lysates were subdivided, and specific antibodies or isotype control IgG antibodies (mock condition) were added using 7.5 μg antibody per mL of pre-cleaned lysate. Isotype control IgG antibodies (mock antibodies) were used in the same concentration as the protein-specific antibodies. After 30 min at 4°C under gentle agitation, 37.5 μL pre-washed Protein G covered Dynabeads / mL lysate were added, and the incubation was continued for 90 min at 4°C under gentle agitation. Finally, beads were washed with CHAPS lysis buffer three times shortly and three times for 10 min at 4°C under gentle agitation, and taken up in 1 x sample buffer. Samples were heated for 5 min at 95°C and separated by SDS-PAGE. For IP experiments with TSC2 and respective mock antibodies, the samples were heated for 10 min at 70°C.
For TSC1-IPs with NaCl and SDS washes ( Figure 5 C), the IP was performed as detailed above but with a CHAPS-based IP lysis buffer without NaCl (40 mM HEPES, [pH 7.5] and 0.3% CHAPS). Before the final washing steps, the TSC1-IP was subdivided into six tubes. Each IP was washed with CHAPS-based lysis buffer supplemented with the indicated NaCl or SDS concentrations three times shortly and three times for 10 min at 4°C under gentle agitation, and taken up in 1 x sample buffer. Samples were heated for 10 min at 70°C and separated by SDS-PAGE. The TSC1 antibody (TSC1 #1) was a gift from Michael N. Hall and generated as previously described ( Molle, 2006 83. Molle, K.-D. Regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2).

For FLAG-IP experiments ( Figures 5 N and 5O), 2 × 10 6 HEK293T cells per dish were seeded in 10 cm dishes (2 dishes per condition). 24 hours after seeding, the cells were co-transfected with 2 μg LAMP2-GFP (full length) and 1 μg pCMV6-MYC-FLAG-G3BP1 constructs (full-length or truncated versions) using Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 hours, the cells were lysed and IP was performed as described above adjusting the samples to 1 – 1.5 mL per 10 cm cell culture plate, depending on the cell density. Protein G covered Dynabeads were used for the IP and samples were heated for 5 min at 95°C and separated by SDS-PAGE.
For GFP-IP experiments in HEK293T cells ( Figure 5 D), 1.7 × 10 6 cells per 10 cm dish were seeded (1 dish per condition). 24 hours after seeding, the cells were co-transfected with 2 μg TSC2-GFP (full length) and 1 μg pCMV6-MYC-FLAG-G3BP1 constructs (full-length or truncated versions) using Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 hours of transient overexpression, the cells were lysed and IP was performed as described above adjusting the samples to 1 – 1.5 mL per 10 cm cell culture plate, depending on the cell density. Protein G covered Dynabeads were used for the IP and samples were heated for 10 min at 95°C and separated by SDS-PAGE.
For GFP-IP experiments in HEK293-β 2 AR cells ( Figure 5 B), 1.7 × 10 6 cells per dish were seeded in 10 cm dishes (2 dishes per condition). 24 hours after seeding, the cells were co-transfected with 2 μg TSC2-GFP (full length) and 1 μg G3BP1-myc constructs (full-length or truncated versions) using Transfectin (ratio 2:1) in FBS-free DMEM, following the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 hours of transient overexpression, cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and pooled into one tube per condition. Cells were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 minute at room temperature and resuspended in 1 mL of CHAPS-based IP lysis buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitors (100 μM Leupeptin, 100 μM Aprotinin, 1 μg / mL Pepstatin A) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM Sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM Sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM Sodium fluoride). The cells were disrupted and the DNA was sheared through the repeated use of a syringe with a 21G x 0.80 mm needle. Afterward, the lysate was incubated on ice for 15 min at 4°C, centrifuged for 45 min at 16,000 g at 4°C, the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes. In case of viscous supernatants, the DNA shearing was repeated. Otherwise, the lysates were pre-incubated with 12 μL Protein G Sepharose beads per mL of lysate for 60 min at 4°C under gentle agitation. A fraction of each lysate was mixed with 5 x sample buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8]; 4% (w/v) SDS; 3% (w/v) DTT; 0.02% (v/v) bromophenol blue), referred to as ‘lysate’ in the figure panels. For IP, the pre-cleared lysates were subdivided, and 1 μg/mL of anti-GFP antibody or anti-Flag antibody were added. After 3 hours at 4°C under gentle agitation, 12 μL Protein G Sepharose beads per mL lysate were added, and the incubation was continued for 60 min at 4°C under gentle agitation. Finally, beads were washed with CHAPS-based lysis buffer five times shortly and once for 5 min at 4°C under gentle agitation. In between the samples were centrifuged for 1 minute at 9,600 g to remove the supernatant. Finally, the IP samples were dissolved in 30 μL 1 x sample buffer. Samples were heated for 5 min at 95°C and separated by SDS-PAGE.
The Wistar Cmd:(WI)WU rats that were used to obtain brain tissue for IP of endogenous TSC1 ( Figure 7 A) were sacrificed according to protocol, which complied with European Community Council Directive 2010/63/EU. The cerebral cortex from one hemisphere of a rat brain was homogenized in 4 mL lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 120 mM NaCl) containing 0.3% CHAPS, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, using a glass teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted 1:1 with lysis buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS and incubated under gentle agitation for 90 min at room temperature. The brain lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 g, 4°C for 10 min, the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes. A fraction of each lysate was mixed with 4 x sample buffer, referred to as ‘lysate’ input in the figure panels. 30 μL of Protein G covered Dynabeads were pre-conjugated in lysis buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS with 4 μg of TSC1 antibody or isotype control rabbit IgG (mock condition) for 2 hours at 4°C. For IP, the pre-conjugated beads were incubated with the lysate at 4°C overnight under gentle agitation. Finally, beads were washed with lysis buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS four times for 3 min at 4°C under gentle agitation, and taken up in 1 x sample buffer. Samples were heated for 10 min at 95°C and separated by SDS-PAGE.
Cells were lysed in homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM imidazole), supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 and Cocktail 3 on a rocking platform for 30 min at 4°C. Subsequently, cells were scraped and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was discarded, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the absolute protein concentration was determined with Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate by calculating a BSA adjustment curve ranging from 0.5 mg / mL to 7.5 mg / mL BSA. 1.5 mg protein was loaded on 4 mL of a continuous sucrose gradient (10% to 40% sucrose) and centrifuged 194,000 x g for 16 hours. Each sample was divided into 26 fractions and 5 x sample buffer was added to a final concentration of 1 x. Every second fraction was analyzed by immunoblot. Quantitation of pixel intensities was performed as described below. Normalization was carried out against the average value of all lanes, and normalized values of each lane were plotted for n = 3 independent experiments. Quantitations in Figure 3 A and S4 D show pixel intensities of immunoblot detections for each fraction as % of the overall signal of all fractions.
Lysosomes were loaded with ferromagnetic nanoparticles (DexoMAG) by incubating MCF-7 cells for 12 hours in DMEM with 10% FBS, 10% DexoMAG solution and 10 mM HEPES. Afterward, cells were washed twice with wash buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM triethanolamine, 10 mM acetic acid, [pH 7.8]), then scraped and pelleted by centrifugation at 150 g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer (wash buffer supplemented with 1 mM EDTA, and protease (5 mM benzaminidine, 5 µM E64, 1 mM AEBSF, 1 μM aprotinin, 1 μM leupeptin, 100 μM pepstatin A) and phosphatase (1 mM Sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM Sodium fluoride, 10 mM Sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM Sodium glycerophosphate) inhibitors. Cells were homogenized by 10 strokes with a dounce homogenizer and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 200 g for 10 min. An LS MACS column was attached to a QuadroMACS magnet, equilibrated with 1 mL PBS and 0.5% BSA, and then washed with 1 mL PBS. The postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was loaded onto the equilibrated column. The column was washed twice with 600 μL column wash buffer (PBS, 0.1 mM sucrose, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Finally, lysosomes (lyso-prep) were eluted by detaching the column from the magnet and plunging with 400 μL elution buffer (PBS, 0.5 mM sucrose, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). All isolation steps were performed at 4°C. Protein amounts were calculated using a BCA assay and equal protein amounts of PNS and lyso-prep were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as detailed above, with nitrocellulose membranes and chemiluminescence detection using a ChemiDoc XRS+ camera.
10 μg of freshly isolated lyso-prep were incubated with 0, 2.5 μg, 5 μg or 10 μg trypsin, respectively at 37°C for 5 min and subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with nitrocellulose membranes and chemiluminescence detection using a ChemiDoc XRS+ camera.
In order to analyze SG assembly, cells were grown on coverslips and treated as indicated in the respective figures. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 min on ice. After fixation, cells were washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 60 s. Cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 3% FBS in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies against G3BP1 and EIF3A at 4°C overnight. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 and Alexa Fluor 488 labeled secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Afterward, cells were washed three times with PBS and twice in deionized water. The cells were mounted with Mowiol 4-88, including DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) and supplemented with 10% NPG (n-propyl-gallate). Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Images were taken using a wide-field AxioObserver Z1 microscope equipped with an Apotome, a 63x / 1.4 oil objective, and an AxioCamMRm CCD camera. For each experimental setup, the magnification and exposure times were adjusted to the condition with the brightest signal, and the settings were retained throughout for all conditions. For presentation in figures, regions of interest (ROI) were selected and maintained for all channels, and single layers of Z stacks were exported as TIFF with no compression using Zen2012 blue edition software, and brightness and contrast were adjusted for better visibility. For single channel images, channels were pseudo-colored white, for merge images, the Alexa 488 channel was left green and the Alexa 568 channel was left magenta. Pictures are representative of n = 3 independent experiments, except the 0 min arsenite condition in the shG3BP1 #1 cells (n = 2; Figure S2 Q).
The number of EIF3A positive puncta / cell was analyzed on unprocessed image raw files without any adjustment using Fiji software version 1.49v ( Schindelin et al., 2012 106. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (18835) PubMed Google Scholar ), creating maximum intensity projections of all Z stacks. We used a background subtraction of 1, threshold adjustment with the intermodes function, and the ‘Analyze Particles’ function with a particle size from 0.2-infinity and a circularity from 0.5-1. SG were counted using the EIF3A channel. The number of EIF3A positive puncta / image was then normalized to the number of cells by counting the nuclei in the Hoechst channel and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Sidak’s multiple comparisons test across n = 9 pictures from n = 3 independent experiments, except the 0 min arsenite condition in the shG3BP1 #1 cells for which only 6 pictures from n = 2 experiments were analyzed.
For analysis of lysosomal foci, LAMP2 was stained as described previously ( Demetriades et al., 2016 29. Demetriades, C. ∙ Plescher, M. ∙ Teleman, A.A. Lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 is a universal response to cellular stress Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10662 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were grown on coverslips and treated as indicated. The medium was removed and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were permeabilized twice with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were blocked with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1% BSA in PBS for 45 min at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies against LAMP2 diluted in 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1% BSA in PBS at 4°C for 2 hours. Afterward, cells were washed four times for 15 min with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1% BSA in PBS and incubated with TRITC labeled secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 at room temperature for 1 hour in the dark. Afterward, cells were washed twice in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 15 min and twice in deionized water and mounted with Mowiol 4-88, supplemented with DABCO and NPG, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Images were taken using a wide-field AxioObserver Z1 microscope equipped with an Apotome, a 63x / 1.4 oil objective, and an AxioCamMRm CCD camera. For each experimental setup, the magnification and exposure times were adjusted to the condition with the brightest signal, and the settings were retained for all conditions. For presentation in figures, regions of interest (ROI) were selected and maintained for all channels, and single layers of Z stacks were exported as TIFF with no compression using Zen2012 blue edition software, and brightness and contrast were adjusted for better visibility. The TRITC channel of the LAMP2 staining was pseudo-colored white. Pictures are representative of n = 12 fields of view from n = 3 independent experiments.
TSC2-LAMP1 co-staining was performed as described previously ( Carroll et al., 2016 21. Carroll, B. ∙ Maetzel, D. ∙ Maddocks, O.D. ... Control of TSC2-Rheb signaling axis by arginine regulates mTORC1 activity eLife. 2016; 5 :e11058 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were grown on coverslips and treated as indicated in Figure 4 C. The medium was removed and cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS and 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hour at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies against TSC2 and LAMP1 at 4°C overnight. The following day, cells were washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Afterward, the cells were washed and coverslips were mounted on slides with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-Diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI). Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Z stack images were taken using a Leica SP8 microscope, a 63x objective, 1.5x digital zoom and filters suitable for the used fluorophores. Identical settings were used to capture images across five to six separate fields (20 to 40 cells) of view. For presentation in figures, pictures were opened in Fiji (version 1.52p) and Z stacks were projected (max). Channels were split and brightness and contrast were adjusted for better visibility. Afterward channels were converted to RGB color. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected and coordinates were copied to maintain the same ROI in the different channels. For single channel images, channels were pseudo-colored white, for merge images, the Alexa 488 channel was left green and the Alexa 555 channel was pseudo-colored magenta. All images were exported as TIFF with no compression.
For TSC2-LAMP1 co-staining, the Manders’ coefficient was calculated using the Coloc2 plug-in of the ImageJ software (v1.51r). Prior to running the plug-in, a mask was made of the DAPI channel and subtracted from the other channels. A constant threshold was applied to all the images in the Z stack, and for every image within each experiment and the Manders’ colocalization coefficient was calculated. Differences in the tested conditions were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Sidak’s multiple comparisons test across n = 5-6 fields of view from one dataset representative of at least n = 3 independent experiments.
For MTOR-LAMP2 co-staining cells were grown on coverslips and treated as indicated in Figure 4 J. The medium was removed and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 3% FBS in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies against MTOR and LAMP2 at 4°C overnight. The following day, cells were washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Afterward, the cells were washed and coverslips were mounted on slides with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI.

In total n = 36 distinct fields of view were analyzed.
For BiFC analysis, we made use of the red fluorophore mLumin ( Chu et al., 2009 22. Chu, J. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Zheng, Y. ...

USA. 2014; 111 :409-414 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). For analysis of interaction between the G3BPs and TSC2, LAMP1, LAMP2 as well as mTOR, HEK293T cells were seeded in a 24 well plate at 100,000 cells / well in full medium 24 hours prior to transfection. The cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer’s protocol in the following combinations: pGW-MYC-LC151-G3BP1 (G3BP1 fused to a C-terminal mLumin fragment) with empty pGW-HA-LN151 as a negative control (an N-terminal mLumin fragment only), and pGW-MYC-LC151-G3BP1 with either pGW-HA-LN151-LAMP1, pGW-HA-LN151-LAMP2, pGW-HA-LN151-MTOR, or pGW-HA-LN151-TSC2, respectively (an N-terminal mLumin fragment fused to LAMP1, LAMP2, MTOR or TSC2, respectively) ( Figure 5 E). For G3BP2, cells were transfected with pGW-MYC-LC151-G3BP2 and either empty pGW-HA-LN151 as a negative control, or pGW-HA-LN151-LAMP1, pGW-HA-LN151-LAMP2, pGW-HA-LN151-MTOR, pGW-HA-LN151-TSC2, respectively ( Figure 5 H). In order to achieve equal expression of all plasmids, 3 times the amount of DNA was used for the MTOR, TSC2 and empty control plasmids in comparison to the G3BP1, G3BP2, LAMP1, and LAMP2 plasmids. Cells were analyzed 48 hours after transfection using a wide-field AxioObserver Z1, equipped with a 10x / 0.3 Plan-NEO objective, an AxioCamMRm CCD camera and an mPlum (64 HE) filter. mLumin fluorescence was analyzed with Fiji version 1.49 using a background subtraction of 50, threshold adjustment from 20-max, a Gaussian Blur filter of 1 and the ‘Analyze Particles’ function with a particle size from 20-infinity. The mLumin fluorophore signal was measured in percent / image and compared between the different combinations by a one-way ANOVA followed by a Sidak’s multiple comparisons test across at least 3 independent fields of view from at least three independent datasets, respectively. In total at least 22 independent fields of view for G3BP1 and 15 independent fields of view for G3BP2 were analyzed. All pictures were taken from regions with a comparable cell density.
For analysis of G3BP1 and G3BP2 homo- and heterodimers, MCF-7 cells were seeded in a 24 well plate at a density of 100,000 cells / well in full medium. 24 hours after seeding, cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer’s protocol in the following combinations: pGW-MYC-LC151-G3BP1 with empty pGW-HA-LN151 as a negative control, or pGW-MYC-LC151-G3BP1 with either pGW-HA-LN151-G3BP1 or pGW-HA-LN151-G3BP2, respectively. In addition, cells were also transfected with pGW-MYC-LC151-G3BP2 together with empty pGW-HA-LN151, or pGW-HA-LN151-G3BP1, or pGW-HA-LN151-G3BP2, respectively. Cells were also transfected with the respective BiFC constructs in the other orientation, namely empty pGW-MYC-LC151 with pGW-HA-LN151-G3BP1, as well as empty pGW-MYC-LC151 with pGW-HA-LN151-G3BP2 ( Figure 2 L). Cells were analyzed 48 hours after transfection using a wide-field AxioObserver Z1, equipped with a 10x / 0.3 Plan-NEO objective, an AxioCamMRm CCD camera and an mPlum (64 HE) filter. mLumin fluorescence was analyzed with Fiji version 1.49 using a background subtraction of 50, threshold adjustment from 40-max, a Gaussian Blur filter of 1 and the ‘Analyze Particles’ function with a particle size from 10-infinity. The mLumin fluorophore signal was measured in percent / image and compared between the different combinations by a one-way ANOVA followed by a Sidak’s multiple comparisons test across in total at least 14 independent fields of view from at least three independent datasets.

In all BiFC experiments shown, the protein fused to the C-terminal mLumin fragment is indicated first, and the protein fused to the N-terminal mLumin fragment is indicated second.
For TSC2-LAMP2 PLAs ( Figure 4 A), MCF-7 cells were trypsinized and seeded in a 16-well chamber slide at a density of 4x10 4 cells per well 72 h after siRNA transfection with siG3BP1 or si Renilla luciferase. The following day, cells were washed twice with HBSS, starved in HBSS for 16 hours, and then stimulated for 15 min with high-glucose DMEM containing 4 mM glutamine and 1 μM insulin. Afterward, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 5 min. The PLA was performed using the Duolink In Situ Red Starter Kit Mouse/ Rabbit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after permeabilization, the samples were blocked, and then incubated overnight with antibodies against LAMP2 and TSC2. The following day, the samples were incubated with the MINUS and PLUS PLA probes corresponding to the primary antibodies used, followed by ligation and rolling-circle amplification in the presence of Texas-Red labeled oligos to generate the PLA signal. Finally, the samples were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium. All incubations were performed in a humidity chamber using a volume of 40 μL per well. The experiment was imaged with a confocal microscope (SP8, Leica); twelve stacks (7-8 μm thick with 0.3 μm spacing between consecutive layers) per condition were acquired.
For G3BP1-TSC2 and G3BP1-LAMP1 PLAs, MCF-7 CRISPR control and G3BP1 KO cells were seeded in a 16-well chamber slide at a density of 2x10 4 cells per well. The following day, cells were washed twice with PBS, and incubated with HBSS for 16 hours. Afterward, cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The PLA was performed as described above with antibodies against G3BP1 and TSC2 or LAMP1. The slides were analyzed using an AxioObserver Z1 compound microscope equipped with an Apotome (6 pictures per slide), 63x objective, and Axiocam 702mono and Axiocam 298 color cameras. Six stacks (0.5 μm thick) per condition were acquired.
For quantitation of all PLAs, the number of PLA puncta was counted across maximum intensity projections of raw files of each stack using CellProfiler ( McQuin et al., 2018 79. McQuin, C. ∙ Goodman, A. ∙ Chernyshev, V. ... CellProfiler 3.0: Next-generation image processing for biology PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 :e2005970 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then normalized to the number of DAPI-positive nuclei in that field of view. The mean of the respective control condition was set to 1. In Figure 4 A the mean of the Control at 0 min insulin / aa stimulation was normalized to 1. For presentation in figures, maximum intensity projections were exported as TIFF, and brightness or contrast were adjusted for better visibility.
For analysis of cell migration into a cell-free space (scratch assays) ( Figure 6 A), 2-well ibidi culture-inserts were placed into 24-well plates, generating a cell-free gap of 500 μM. After knockdown induction for 4 days, 15,000 cells / well were seeded in 100 μL full DMEM medium. 4 replicates were seeded per condition and cell line (MCF-7 shControl and shG3BP1 #1) in the presence of 2 μg / mL doxycycline to induce shRNA expression. Where indicated, rapamycin was added during seeding to a final concentration of 20 nM (24 hours prior to the 0 h time point). After 24 hours, ibidi culture-inserts were removed and the medium was replaced with 1 mL full DMEM medium, supplemented with 20 nM rapamycin where indicated. Pictures were taken after 0, 24, and 48 hours with a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti-E/B inverted microscope, equipped with a 4x objective, using the NIS Elements version 4.13.04 software (settings: optimal frame size 1280 × 1024, no binning, 12 bit). Pictures were taken from two different regions in an automated manner by selecting the x- and y-coordinates of the 24-well plate, assuring that the same region of the scratch was monitored across all conditions. Pictures were exported as TIFF files converting the 12 bit to 16 bit and analyzed using the TScratch software ( Gebäck et al., 2009 39. Gebäck, T. ∙ Schulz, M.M. ∙ Koumoutsakos, P. ... TScratch: a novel and simple software tool for automated analysis of monolayer wound healing assays Biotechniques. 2009; 46 :265-274 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a consistent threshold of 250. For quantitation, the width of the open wound area of the 48 hour time point was normalized to the initial scratch size at the 0 h time point and expressed as the percentage of wound closure. Data was compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Sidak’s multiple comparisons test across n = 12 scratches from 3 independent experiments.
For Transwell migration assays ( Figure 6 E), FluoroBlok cell culture inserts with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane which blocks the transmission of light between 400 and 700 nm were placed, one insert / well, into 24-well companion plates with 750 μL of full DMEM medium containing 10% FBS as chemoattractant. 100,000 MDA-MB-231 Control or G3BP1 KO cells were subsequently seeded in 500 μL DMEM supplemented with 3 mM L-glutamine and 2% FBS into the top chamber of the inserts. After 6-8 hours, medium was flipped out of the inserts, and inserts were placed into a second 24-well companion plate with 500 μL / well HBSS medium and a final concentration of 4 μg / mL Calcein fluorescent dye. Living cells were stained with Calcein for 1 hour. Finally, inserts were placed into a third 24-well plate with 500 μL HBSS / well, and fluorescence of migrated cells was measured with the Tecan i-control software (v1.10.4.0) and a Tecan Infinite 200 PRO plate reader equipped with 485 / 530 (excitation / emission) filter. Calcein fluorescence (494 / 517 (ex / em)) was measured from the bottom of the plate so that only those cells that migrated through the light-blocking PET membrane were measured. Three wells per cell line were measured in parallel as technical replicates. The average fluorescence value per well was calculated from nine reads / well (3 × 3) and the average fluorescence value from all three wells was normalized to 1 for the MDA-MB-231 Control cells and the fold change of the G3BP1 KO cells was compared using a paired Student’s t test across n = 5 independent experiments.
Microscope pictures of the migrated cells were taken with a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti-E/B inverted microscope, equipped with a 4x objective and a GFP filter, using the NIS Elements version 4.13.04 software (settings: optimal frame size 1280 × 1024, no binning, 12 bit). Pictures were exported as TIFF files converting the 12 bit to 16 bit. The representative pictures were exported as TIFF with no compression and a pseudo-colored white Calcein signal using Zen2012 blue edition software.
Cell proliferation was monitored using an xCELLigence real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system, allowing real-time, label free cellular analysis. After knockdown induction for 4 days, MCF-7 cells (MCF-7 shControl and shG3BP1 #1) were seeded in duplicates at a total of 2,000 cells per E-plate 16 chamber following the manufacturer’s protocol, in the presence of 2 μg / mL doxycycline. Proliferation was measured as the relative change in electrical impedance every 30 min for 5 days until the cells reached the stationary growth phase. Proliferation was analyzed using the RTCA software 1.2. For presentation of the growth curves in Figure 6 C, the measured impedance is displayed as relative confluence, normalized to 1 for the maximum value. In Figure 6 D RTCA proliferation is shown as slope/h; shControl (normalized to 1) and shG3BP1 #1 cells were compared using a paired two-tailed Student’s t test across n = 6 independent experiments.
G3BP1 mRNA expression analysis ( Figure 6 G). Clinical and RNaseq data of invasive breast cancer (TCGA, provisional) were downloaded from cBio Cancer Genomics Portal ( http://www.cbioportal.org ) using the CGDS-R package ( Gao et al., 2013 37. Gao, J. ∙ Aksoy, B.A. ∙ Dogrusoz, U. ... Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal Sci. Signal. 2013; 6 :pl1 Crossref Scopus (5648) PubMed Google Scholar ), and classified according to PAM50. For 522 patients, information on the breast cancer subtype was available, of which 514 had RNaseq V2 data for G3BP1 . A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA by ranks was applied to evaluate subtype-dependent differences in G3BP1 transcription. n = 231 for luminal A, n = 127 for luminal B, n = 58 for HER2-enriched and n = 97 for basal-like. Data are shown as boxplots, representing the median with 25 th and 75 th percentiles as boxes and 5 th and 95 th percentiles as whiskers. The p value of the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA by ranks is shown.
The Kaplan Meier Plotter database ( http://www.kmplot.com ; Györffy et al., 2010 44. Györffy, B. ∙ Lanczky, A. ∙ Eklund, A.C. ... An online survival analysis tool to rapidly assess the effect of 22,277 genes on breast cancer prognosis using microarray data of 1,809 patients Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2010; 123 :725-731 Crossref Scopus (1536) PubMed Google Scholar ; Szász et al., 2016 115. Szász, A.M. ∙ Lánczky, A. ∙ Nagy, Á. ... Cross-validation of survival associated biomarkers in gastric cancer using transcriptomic data of 1,065 patients Oncotarget. 2016; 7 :49322-49333 Crossref Scopus (500) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for survival analysis. Relapse free survival (RFS) was assessed in breast cancer patients based on gene expression of G3BP1 (probeID: 225007_at) ( Figure 6 H), TSC1 (probeID: 209390_at) ( Figure 6 J), and TSC2 (probeID: 215735_at) ( Figure 6 K). Outlier gene arrays were excluded leaving 1764 patients for analysis of G3BP1 and 3571 patients for analyses of TSC1/TSC2 . n = 1224 with high G3BP1 mRNA expression; n = 409 with low G3BP1 mRNA expression; n = 2541 with high TSC1 mRNA expression; n = 1030 with low TSC1 mRNA expression; n = 1712 with high TSC2 mRNA expression; n = 1859 with low TSC2 mRNA expression.
RFS analysis in relation to G3BP1 protein expression ( Figure 6 I) also was based on data available in the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, which included 126 patients. n = 57 with high G3BP1 protein expression; n = 67 with low G3BP1 protein expression.
For all calculations, patients were split based on the best performing expression threshold and log-rank p values were calculated.
For pharmacological assessment, 3 dpf larvae were individually placed into the wells of a 24-well or 96-well-plate, with each well containing 400 μL or 100 μL, respectively, of a freshly prepared 10 μM rapamycin or 25 μM ethosuximide solution in embryo medium. The untreated larvae were treated similarly with 400 μL or 100 μL of embryo medium. Larvae were incubated for 24 hours, and non-invasive local field potential recordings, locomotor tracking and in vivo imaging experiments were carried out as described below.
For Rps6-pS235/236 analysis 10 zebrafish larvae (2-3 dpf) were pooled per condition and independent experiment (n = 4) and homogenized in RIPA buffer supplemented with Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor cocktail. A Pierce BCA protein assay kit was used to determine the protein concentration of the lysates. 40 μg of protein were separated on a NuPage Novex 10% Bis-Tris gel, using SDS-PAGE with NuPage MES SDS running buffer, followed by dry transfer to an iBlot gel transfer stacks nitrocellulose membrane with an iBlot Dry Blotting System, which was then blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in Odyssey blocking buffer. Overnight incubation at 4°C with a primary antibody against RPS6-pS235/236 was followed by incubation with Dylight secondary goat antibody to rabbit IgG for 1 hour at room temperature. A rabbit antibody against GAPDH was used as a loading control. For detection, fluorescence signal was detected using an Odyssey 2.1 imaging system (Li-Cor, USA). For graphical presentation, raw images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop version CS5.1.
For IF analysis of the zebrafish pallium, 4 dpf zebrafish larvae were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1 M sodium fluoride for whole-mount immunostaining with DAPI and an antibody against RPS6-pS235/236. The whole front brains were imaged using a Z.1 Light sheet microscope, equipped with a 40x objective (NA 1.0). Images were analyzed in Fiji.
For analysis of cell migration in vivo , we utilized the Tg ( HuC:GCaMP5G ) stable transgenic zebrafish line in the mitfa −/− ;royorbisson −/− genetic background ( Ahrens et al., 2013 1. Ahrens, M.B. ∙ Orger, M.B. ∙ Robson, D.N. ... Whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution using light-sheet microscopy Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :413-420 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ) to follow the migration of newly-born HuC-positive neuronal progenitors ( Kim et al., 1996 64. Kim, C.H. ∙ Ueshima, E. ∙ Muraoka, O. ... Zebrafish elav/HuC homologue as a very early neuronal marker Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 216 :109-112 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) from the subventricular zone (SVZ) toward the outer layers. Tg ( HuC:GCaMP5G ) zebrafish larvae were injected with g3bp1 MO or control MO. 24 hours post fertilization (hpf), embryos were anesthetized with 0.02% tricaine (MS-222) and embedded in 2% agarose for imaging. The front brains were imaged using a Z.1 Light sheet microscope, equipped with a 40x objective (NA 1.0). Images were taken with 0.8 zoom in a time-lapse mode every 5 min for 2 hours in 32 degrees (approximately 2.5 hours of zebrafish development).
Images were processed and analyzed in Fiji (version 1.53c). Each hemisphere was analyzed separately. Briefly, spatial drift was corrected across time points, then 3D projections were generated for quantification of the number of HuC-positive cells migrating from the SVZ to the telencephalon. The single cell tracking of movement dynamics was performed with TrackMate ( Tinevez et al., 2017 123. Tinevez, J.Y. ∙ Perry, N. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrackMate: An open and extensible platform for single-particle tracking Methods. 2017; 115 :80-90 Crossref Scopus (689) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Brain activity of 4 dpf zebrafish larvae was assessed by performing non-invasive local field potential (LFP) recordings, reading the electrical signal from the skin of the larvae’s head ( Zdebik et al., 2013 139. Zdebik, A.A. ∙ Mahmood, F. ∙ Stanescu, H.C. ... Epilepsy in kcnj10 morphant zebrafish assessed with a novel method for long-term EEG recordings PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e79765 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). g3bp1 MO or control MO injected zebrafish larvae were treated on 3 dpf for 24 hours with rapamycin or left untreated. A glass pipet (containing the recording electrode), filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (124 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM KH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3 and 10 mM glucose), was positioned on the skin above the optic tectum or the pallium using a stereomicroscope. The differential signal between the recording electrode and the reference electrode was amplified 10,000 times by DAGAN 2400 amplifier (Minnesota, USA), band pass filtered at 0.3-300 Hz and digitized at 2 kHz via a PCI-6251 interface (National Instruments, UK) with WinEDR (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, UK). Recordings lasted for 10 min and were analyzed with Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices Corporation, USA). A polyspiking discharge was scored positive when its amplitude exceeded three times the amplitude of the baseline and it had a duration of at least 50 ms. At least n = 34 larvae for LFPs of zebrafish pallia ( Figure 7 L) and at least n = 20 larvae for LFPs of zebrafish optic tecta ( Figure 7 N) were analyzed.
Three representative 10 minute LFP recordings are shown for control and g3bp1 MO without and with rapamycin, respectively in Figure 7 M (pallia) and Figure 7 O (optic tecta).
The Tg ( HuC:GCaMP5G ) ( Ahrens et al., 2013 1. Ahrens, M.B. ∙ Orger, M.B. ∙ Robson, D.N. ... Whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution using light-sheet microscopy Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :413-420 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ) stable zebrafish line in the mitfa −/− ;royorbisson −/− genetic background was used for pan-neuronal activity imaging. g3bp1 MO or control MO injected zebrafish larvae were treated on 3 dpf for 24 hours with rapamycin or left untreated. 4 dpf zebrafish larvae were embedded in 2% agarose for imaging and the tails were cleared of agarose to allow movement. The front brains were imaged using lightsheet microscopy (Z.1 Lightsheet microscope, Zeiss) and 40x objective (NA 1.0) at zoom 0.8x. Images were taken in a time-lapse mode every 7 s for 3 min. Images were processed and analyzed in Fiji2 similarly to Kedra et al. (2020) 61. Kedra, M. ∙ Banasiak, K. ∙ Kisielewska, K. ... TrkB hyperactivity contributes to brain dysconnectivity, epileptogenesis, and anxiety in zebrafish model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :2170-2179 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar . Each hemisphere was analyzed separately. Briefly, spatial drift was corrected across time points, then changes in the fluorescence intensity were calculated using the measurement tool in Fiji and Rstudio ( rstudio.com ) in a semi-automated manner. The linear model was fitted to empirical data using the LOESS regression and smoothing function in RStudio (least-squares regression in localized subsets).
Tg(dlx5a/dlx6a-EGFP) x Tg(vglut2a:loxP-RFP-loxP-GFP) zebrafish ( Noble et al., 2015 88. Noble, S. ∙ Godoy, R. ∙ Affaticati, P. ... Transgenic Zebrafish Expressing mCherry in the Mitochondria of Dopaminergic Neurons Zebrafish. 2015; 12 :349-356 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Satou et al., 2012 104. Satou, C. ∙ Kimura, Y. ∙ Higashijima, S. Generation of multiple classes of V0 neurons in zebrafish spinal cord: progenitor heterogeneity and temporal control of neuronal diversity J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :1771-1783 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) larvae, injected with control or g3bp1 MO, were anesthetized at 4 dpf with tricaine (MS-222), immobilized in 2% low melting point agarose on a cover glass. For imaging of the glutamatergic and GABAergic networks in the optic tectum a two-photon LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with an LD LCI Plan Apo 25x/0.8 objective was used. The EGFP and RFP markers were respectively excited at 488 nm and 561 nm and emission was recorded at 493 / 548 nm and 593 / 656 nm, respectively. All stacks were visualized and analyzed using Imaris 9.1. GABAergic and glutamatergic cells were counted as 5.5 μm and 3.5 μm diameter spheres respectively, and sorted by their fluorescence. The threshold was adapted in order to count all cells.
The locomotor behavior of 4 dpf zebrafish larvae was evaluated by means of an automated tracking device (Zebrabox TM ). tsc2 MO or g3bp1 MO and their respective control MO injected larvae were treated on 3 dpf for 24 hours with rapamycin ( Figures 7 W and 7X) or ethosuximide ( Figure 7 Y) or left untreated. Zebrafish larvae were arrayed individually into a 24-well plate that contained 400 μL of embryo medium per well. After an adaptation phase of 5 min in the Zebrabox, the locomotor activity was tracked for 15 min in the dark. The total movement was expressed in “actinteg” units, which are defined as the sum of all image pixel changes detected during the time of the tracking experiment.
The 100,000 Genomes Project data (GEL, The National Genomics Research and Healthcare Knowledgebase v5, Genomics England. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4530893.v5 . 2019.) was accessed and analyzed through the Genomics England Research Environment via https://re.extge.co.uk/ovd/ . A bash script ( Document S3 ) was written to identify all single nucleotide variants (SNV) within G3BP1 at chr5:151771954-151812785 (GRCh38/hg38, Genbank: NM_198395 ) and G3BP2 at chr4:75642769-75673483 (GRCh38/hg38, Genbank: NM_203505 ). Genomes of 64,185 participants with rare diseases and matched family members were analyzed. Variants were filtered for protein altering SNVs. Depth of coverage at variant loci was determined in probands and their available relatives. Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were assessed using GnomAD ( https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/ ). In silico prediction scores predicting pathogenicity were determined using SIFT, PolyPhen, CADD and exomiser.
Quantitation of raw images taken with a LAS-4000 camera system or FUSION FX7 with DarQ-9 camera was performed using ImageQuant TL Version 8.1. Background subtraction was performed using the rolling ball method with a defined radius of 200 for all images. Quantitation of raw images taken with a ChemiDoc XRS+ camera system was performed using Image Lab version 5.2.1. For all images, pixel values of a single lane were normalized to the average value of all lanes, and then normalized to the loading control indicated in the respective immunoblot figure. Quantitation of raw images taken with an Odyssey 2.1 imaging system (Li-Cor) was performed using Image Studio Lite Version 5.2. For images from immunoblot analysis of zebrafish samples ( Figure 7 B), pixel values of a single lane were normalized to the single value of the loading control GAPDH and then to the Control MO within each experiment.
To analyze the sequence similarities between human G3BP1 (UniProt: Q13283 ) and human G3BP2 (UniProt: Q9UN86) and their domains, or between human and zebrafish G3BP1 (UniProt: Q6P124) EMBOSS Needle ( Madeira et al., 2019 74. Madeira, F. ∙ Park, Y.M. ∙ Lee, J. ... The EMBL-EBI search and sequence analysis tools APIs in 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W636-W641 Crossref Scopus (953) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the Blosum62 matrix was used. Visualization of sequence alignments was done using Texshade based on a ClustalW alignment of the whole protein sequences. The domains indicated for G3BP1 were based on Reineke and Lloyd (2015) 99. Reineke, L.C. ∙ Lloyd, R.E. The stress granule protein G3BP1 recruits protein kinase R to promote multiple innate immune antiviral responses J. Virol. 2015; 89 :2575-2589 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar .
To identify possible orthologs in other species, the human proteins G3BP1 (UniProt: Q13283 ), G3BP2 (UniProt: Q9UN86), TSC1 (UniProt: Q92574 ), TSC2 (UniProt: P49815 ), TBC1D7 (UniProt: Q9P0N9 ), RHEB (UniProt: Q15382 ), and MTOR (UniProt: P42345 ) were used as query proteins for a blastp+ search ( Camacho et al., 2009 19. Camacho, C. ∙ Coulouris, G. ∙ Avagyan, V. ... BLAST+: architecture and applications BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :421 Crossref Scopus (6135) PubMed Google Scholar ) against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database (nr; version 2017-11). The e value cut-off for identified proteins was 1e-30 with a maximum of 20,000 target sequences, disabled low-complexity filtering, using the BLOSUM62 matrix, a word size of 6 and gap opening and extension costs of 11 and 1, respectively. The results were parsed and filtered using custom Python scripts ( https://github.com/MolecularBioinformatics/Phylogenetic-analysis ) and manually curated as described earlier ( Bockwoldt et al., 2019 15. Bockwoldt, M. ∙ Houry, D. ∙ Niere, M. ... Identification of evolutionary and kinetic drivers of NAD-dependent signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :15957-15966 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
GraphPad Prism version 7.04 or 8.03 was used for statistical analysis and statistical presentation of quantitations. p values are presented in the figures above or below the compared conditions.
Where two conditions were compared, either a paired two-tailed Student’s t test ( Figures 1 S, 2 F, 2H, 3 E, 3I, 3K, 3L, 3O–3Q, 4 F, 4G, 6 D, 6F, 7 C, S2 I, S2J, S2L, S2M, S2O, S2P, and S4 B) or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test ( Figures 7 F, 7I, 7Q–7S, 7U, and 7V), or an unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney test ( Figures 7 G, 7H, 7J, 7K, and 7T) was performed. Cell size was compared using multiple unpaired t tests ( Figures 4 H and S4 K).
If more than two conditions were compared, a one-way ANOVA followed by a Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was applied ( Figures 1 D, 1E, 1G–1I, 1K–1M, 1O–1Q, 1U–1X, 2 B–2D, 2J, 2M, 4 B, 4D, 4I, 4L–4N, 5 F, 5I, 5J, 5M, 6 B, 7 L, 7N, 7W–7Y, S1 M–S1O, S1Q–S1S, S1U, S1V, S2 B–S2D, S2R, S2T, S2U, S2W, S2X, S4 F, S4G, S4I, and S4J). In the case of immunoblot time courses more than two conditions were compared using a two-way ANOVA ( Figures S1 G, S1H, S1J, S1K, S2 E, and S2F).
For G3BP1 expression analysis ( Figure 6 G) a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA by ranks was performed using Dell Statistica version 13. For the analysis of relapse-free survival ( Figures 6 H–6K) the Kaplan-Meier Plotter was used and a log-rank test was applied.
For each experiment, the number of replicates is indicated in the figure legend with “n” designating the number of biological replicates if not indicated otherwise. For bar graphs, the corresponding dot plots were overlaid.
For each experiment the appropriate controls were used as described above: Control KO cells for G3BP1 KO; Control KO cells for TSC2 KO; shControl cells for shG3BP1 #1 and shG3BP1 #2; siControl transfected cells for siG3BP1, siG3BP2, siRHEB and siTSC2; si Renilla transfected cells (Control) for siG3BP1 ( Figure 4 A); control MO injected zebrafish larvae for g3bp1 MO; control MO injected zebrafish larvae for tsc2 MO.
