Title: Cholesterol and matrisome pathways dysregulated in astrocytes and microglia


Abstract: Summary

The impact of apolipoprotein E ε4 ( APOE4 ), the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), on human brain cellular function remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of APOE4 on brain cell types derived from population and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells, post-mortem brain, and APOE targeted replacement mice. Population and isogenic models demonstrate that APOE4 local haplotype, rather than a single risk allele, contributes to risk. Global transcriptomic analyses reveal human-specific, APOE4 -driven lipid metabolic dysregulation in astrocytes and microglia. APOE4 enhances de novo cholesterol synthesis despite elevated intracellular cholesterol due to lysosomal cholesterol sequestration in astrocytes. Further, matrisome dysregulation is associated with upregulated chemotaxis, glial activation, and lipid biosynthesis in astrocytes co-cultured with neurons, which recapitulates altered astrocyte matrisome signaling in human brain. Thus, APOE4 initiates glia-specific cell and non-cell autonomous dysregulation that may contribute to increased AD risk.

Section: Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration, gliosis, and two pathological hallmarks: amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau-laden neurofibrillary tangles ( Selkoe, 2003 99. Selkoe, D.J. Toward a remembrance of things past: deciphering Alzheimer disease Harvey Lect. 2003; 99 :23-45 PubMed Google Scholar ). Most AD cases are sporadic with an age of onset >65 years and reflect a complex genetic and environmental etiology ( Karch and Goate, 2015 39. Karch, C.M. ∙ Goate, A.M. Alzheimer's disease risk genes and mechanisms of disease pathogenesis Biol. Psychiatr. 2015; 77 :43-51 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the apolipoprotein E ε4 ( APOE4 ) allele is the strongest genetic AD risk factor; APOE ε4/ε4 ( APOE 44) increases AD risk by 15-fold in Europeans ( Genin et al., 2011 24. Genin, E. ∙ Hannequin, D. ∙ Wallon, D. ... APOE and Alzheimer disease: a major gene with semi-dominant inheritance Mol. Psychiatr. 2011; 16 :903-907 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Africans exhibit lower APOE4 -associated AD risk, while East Asians show higher APOE4 risk than Europeans ( Liu et al., 2014 60. Liu, M. ∙ Bian, C. ∙ Zhang, J. ...

Although the association between APOE4 and increased AD risk is well-established, the mechanisms underlying risk in particular human brain cell types are unclear. APOE targeted replacement ( APOE -TR) mice exhibit APOE genotype-dependent effects on Aβ seeding, Aβ clearance, and tau-dependent neurodegeneration when crossed with APP or MAPT mutant mice ( Holtzman et al., 2000 33.

ApoE4 markedly exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in a mouse model of tauopathy Nature. 2017; 549 :523-527 Crossref Scopus (525) PubMed Google Scholar ). Astrocyte-specific APOE4 deletion rescues tau-mediated neurodegeneration ( Wang et al., 2021 112. Wang, C. ∙ Xiong, M. ∙ Gratuze, M. ...

APOE4 also contributes to decreased synaptic plasticity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction ( Chen et al., 2010 14. Chen, Y. ∙ Durakoglugil, M.S. ∙ Xian, X. ... ApoE4 reduces glutamate receptor function and synaptic plasticity by selectively impairing ApoE receptor recycling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

APOE4 leads to blood-brain barrier dysfunction predicting cognitive decline Nature. 2020; 581 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies suggest APOE4 affects multiple cell types.
In mice, Apoe is mainly produced by astrocytes with low microglial expression ( Xu et al., 2006 117. Xu, Q. ∙ Bernardo, A. ∙ Walker, D. ... Profile and regulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) expression in the CNS in mice with targeting of green fluorescent protein gene to the ApoE locus J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :4985-4994 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ); similarly in humans, APOE is primarily expressed in astrocytes ( Zhang et al., 2016 121.

Purification and characterization of progenitor and mature human astrocytes reveals transcriptional and functional differences with mouse Neuron. 2016; 89 :37-53 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1047) PubMed Google Scholar ). In aging or neurodegeneration, mouse microglia adopt Apoe - and Trem2- dependent disease-associated or neurodegenerative phenotype (DAM or MGnD), upregulating Apoe ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 42.

The TREM2-APOE pathway drives the transcriptional phenotype of dysfunctional microglia in neurodegenerative diseases Immunity. 2017; 47 :566-581.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1038) PubMed Google Scholar ). Disease-associated astrocytes also exhibit increased Apoe ( Habib et al., 2020 30. Habib, N. ∙ McCabe, C. ∙ Medina, S. ... Disease-associated astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease and aging Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23 :701-706 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). While APOE is upregulated in human microglia in AD, the mouse DAM phenotype is absent or only partially overlaps, highlighting species differences between human and mouse and the importance of studying APOE4 in human systems ( Galatro et al., 2017 22.

Med. 2020; 26 :131-142 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To assess the impact of APOE4 on human brain cell types, we examined microglia, astrocytes, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and mixed cortical cultures composing neurons and astrocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of AD and control of differing APOE genotypes. Global transcriptome analyses of hiPSC models, human brain, and APOE -TR mice uncovered APOE4 human-specific astrocyte and microglia phenotypes. APOE4 drives lipid metabolic deficits in human astrocytes and microglia and enhances matrisome, associated with chemotaxis, glial activation, and lipid metabolism in astrocytes through astrocyte-neuron communication. Although transcriptomic changes due to APOE4 mimic APOE knockout (KO), individual genetic background ( APOE local haplotype), and cell-type-specific variation greatly influence these changes, highlighting the necessity of both population and isogenic models for studying non-Mendelian disease-causing risk variants. Together, APOE4 drives both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous cellular mechanisms that contribute to AD risk.

Section: Results

Thirteen population hiPSC lines (6 APOE 44 and 7 APOE 33, herein defined as APOE4 and APOE3 ) were selected from 43 Europeans, balanced for sex and disease status, controlled for age and AD genetic risk using a genetic risk score (GRS), excluding APOE4 , which confirmed APOE4 as the main AD GRS contributor ( Figures 1 A, 1B, S1 A, and S1B; Table S1 ). Individuals did not carry AD risk variants in TREM2 ( Guerreiro et al., 2013 29. Guerreiro, R. ∙ Wojtas, A. ∙ Bras, J. ... TREM2 variants in Alzheimer's disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368 :117-127 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jonsson et al., 2013 38. Jonsson, T. ∙ Stefansson, H. ∙ Steinberg, S. ... Variant of TREM2 associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368 :107-116 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) flanking APOE ( APOE ±50 kbp), the local haplotypes embedded in each ε3 and ε4 allele were classified referenced to the 1000 Genome (1000G) ( Figure S1 A) ( Genomes Project et al., 2015 25. Genomes Project, C. ∙ Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ... A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (7959) PubMed Google Scholar ). By the 1000G haplotype frequencies, we defined common (hap.01–23) and rare (hap.other) haplotypes ( Table S9 ), identifying 8 of 23 common haplotypes in 10 population lines and 11 rare haplotypes (7 hap.other and 4 undetected haplotypes) in 8 population lines ( Figure 1 C). APOE4 occurred on 7 unique haplotypes, while APOE3 occurred on 12 different haplotypes ( Figures 1 C and S1 C); haplotypes were not shared between APOE3 and APOE4 carriers. Strikingly, without APOE4 rs429358, APOE local haplotypes clustered by APOE genotype ( Figure 1 D). Thus, multiple haplotypes encompassing the APOE locus exist in an APOE genotype-dependent manner.
After iPSC reprogramming, which removes age-associated epigenetic signatures ( Lapasset et al., 2011 51. Lapasset, L. ∙ Milhavet, O. ∙ Prieur, A. ... Rejuvenating senescent and centenarian human cells by reprogramming through the pluripotent state Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :2248-2253 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maherali et al., 2007 63.

Directly reprogrammed fibroblasts show global epigenetic remodeling and widespread tissue contribution Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1 :55-70 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), each hiPSC was differentiated to four cell types: microglia ( Abud et al., 2017 2.

An efficient platform for astrocyte differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells Stem Cell Rep. 2017; 9 :600-614 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), mixed cortical cultures ( Bowles et al., 2019 8. Bowles, K.R. ∙ TCW, J. ∙ Qian, L. ... Reduced variability of neural progenitor cells and improved purity of neuronal cultures using magnetic activated cell sorting PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0213374 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and BMECs ( Lippmann et al., 2012 59. Lippmann, E.S. ∙ Azarin, S.M. ∙ Kay, J.E. ... Derivation of blood-brain barrier endothelial cells from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :783-791 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 E), following pluripotency and normal karyotype confirmation ( Figure S1 D; Table S1 ). Differentiated cells were validated by mRNA and protein expression of cell-type-specific markers ( Figures 1 H and S1 H). Principal component analysis (PCA) and Spearman correlation of 52 transcriptomes (4 cell types, 13 lines) obtained by RNA sequencing showed samples clustered by cell type but that were indistinguishable by APOE genotype ( Figures 1 F, 1G, and S1 F), suggesting robust differentiation methods independent of APOE status. Each cell type clustered with their corresponding primary human brain cell type also unaffected by APOE genotype ( Figures S1 G–S1J).
To examine cell-type-specific effects of APOE4 , differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed in each cell type, comparing APOE4 to APOE3 . To identify differences solely contributed by APOE4 rs429358, GRS without APOE locus (GRSnoAPOE), sex, RNA integrity number, and batch were included as covariates ( Figure S2 A). DEGs are in astrocytes > microglia > mixed cortical cultures, but significant DEGs in BMECs were not observed, supporting no difference in tight junction formation assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance by APOE genotype ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S2 B). Therefore, microglia and astrocytes are the major cell types affected by intrinsic APOE genotype. Fast pre-ranked gene set enrichment analysis (fGSEA) with an enhanced permutation identified APOE4 -specific pathways ( Subramanian et al., 2005 105. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (25008) PubMed Google Scholar ). The most significant positively enriched gene set in both microglia and astrocytes was cholesterol biosynthesis and other lipid pathways ( Figures 2 C and 2D). In microglia, negatively enriched gene sets included high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated lipid transport, generic transcription pathway, and lysosome ( Figure 2 C).
Next, we performed causal network analysis of enriched gene sets in APOE4 versus APOE3 using ingenuity pathway analysis ( Kramer et al., 2014 45. Krämer, A. ∙ Green, J. ∙ Pollard, Jr., J. ... Causal analysis approaches in Ingenuity pathway analysis Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :523-530 Crossref Scopus (2579) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cholesterol biosynthesis (e.g., HMGCR and SQLE ) predicts increased cholesterol/terpenoid synthesis and upregulated steroid metabolism in APOE4 microglia ( Figure 2 F). Downregulated DEGs in lysosome (e.g., LAMP1/2 , NPC1/2 , SMPD1 , and LIPA ) predicts enhanced cholesterol accumulation and decreased lipid clearance and catabolism. Reduced cholesterol efflux, including cholesterol transporters (e.g., ABCA1 and ABCG1 ) and proteins regulating lipoprotein secretion (e.g., APOE and APOC2 ), is predicted by HDL-mediated lipid transport in APOE4 microglia. APOE4 astrocytes show upregulated cholesterol synthesis and metabolism ( Figure 2 G). Upstream regulators, transcription factors regulating cholesterol synthesis, SREBF2 and SCAP , are activated, but cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase POR is inhibited in both APOE4 microglia and astrocytes ( Figure 2 H) ( Brown and Goldstein, 2009 10. Brown, M.S. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Cholesterol feedback: from Schoenheimer's bottle to Scap's MELADL J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50 :S15-S27 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmidt et al., 2009 96. Schmidt, K. ∙ Hughes, C. ∙ Chudek, J.A. ... Cholesterol metabolism: the main pathway acting downstream of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in skeletal development of the limb Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29 :2716-2729 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor LXR/RXR , LXR ligands, and nuclear receptors NR1H2 and NR1H3 are downregulated in APOE4 microglia ( Figure 2 I). The most negatively enriched, generic transcription pathway in APOE4 microglia represents decreased farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor FXR/RXR inhibition caused by decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) ( Figures 2 C, 2J, S2 C, and S2D), suppressing lipid efflux potentially due to lower intracellular cholesterol. Thus, global transcriptomic analyses reveal that APOE4 is associated with higher cholesterol synthesis and lower catabolism/efflux, predicting altered intracellular cholesterol levels in APOE4 microglia and astrocytes.
In mixed cortical cultures, relatively few DEGs were identified ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Given the heterogeneity of these cultures ( Figures 1 E and 1H), cell-type proportion measurement was implemented. We identified digital sorting algorithm (DSA) as the best fit algorithm among four: DSA ( Zhong et al., 2013 124. Zhong, Y. ∙ Wan, Y.W. ∙ Pang, K. ...

Phenotypic differences in hiPSC NPCs derived from patients with schizophrenia Mol.

Before and after astrocyte proportion correction, we uncovered enriched matrisome pathways (matrisome-associated, core matrisome, extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, secreted factors, and cytokine signaling) in APOE4 mixed cortical cultures ( Figures 2 E and S2 I). The in silico “matrisome” is defined as ECM protein and associated factor ensembles ( Naba et al., 2012 77. Naba, A. ∙ Clauser, K.R. ∙ Hoersch, S. ... The matrisome: in silico definition and in vivo characterization by proteomics of normal and tumor extracellular matrices Mol. Cell.

The extracellular matrix: tools and insights for the "omics" era Matrix Biol. 2016; 49 :10-24 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). ECM proteins provide cues interpreted by membrane receptors to initiate cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation signaling ( Rozario and DeSimone, 2010 94. Rozario, T. ∙ DeSimone, D.W. The extracellular matrix in development and morphogenesis: a dynamic view Dev. Biol. 2010; 341 :126-140 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ). The “core matrisome” comprises ECM glycoproteins, collagens, and proteoglycans; “matrisome-associated” proteins include ECM-affiliated proteins, regulators, and secreted factors like cytokines released by neurons and glia. Further, the matrisome-associated pathway predicted three functional modules: upregulated chemotaxis, activation/inflammatory responses, and lipid synthesis, and core matrisome displays increased levels of molecules supporting cell migration in APOE4 mixed cortical cultures ( Figures 2 K and S2 J).
Observed differences in population lines cannot be unambiguously attributed to APOE4 due to extensive linkage disequilibrium and haplotypic variation around the APOE locus; thus, CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited isogenic hiPSCs were created from four age-matched, sex-balanced individuals (3 APOE4 and 1 APOE3 ) with 5 different APOE haplotypes (the most to the least frequent in 1000G), yielding 24 isogenic hiPSCs (3 clones/genotype per individual) ( Figures 1 C and 3 A; Table S4 ). Potential guide RNA off-targets were negative, and local APOE haplotypes remained intact; isogenic hiPSCs were karyotypically normal and genetically matched the donor fibroblasts ( Tables S4 and S5 ). PCA and Spearman correlation of isogenic hiPSC-microglia, astrocytes, and mixed cortical cultures confirmed successful differentiation except for one microglia outlier (excluded from further analyses) ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Microglia exclusively clustered by individual, but not by either sex or APOE genotype ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Isogenic microglia also clustered with the donor and retained individuality ( Figure S3 A). Thus, individual genetic background rather than culture environment or gene editing impacts the microglia transcriptome. Inter-individual variability was recently reported from ex vivo human microglia, supporting that this is a novel biological phenomenon, not a hiPSC-microglia artifact ( Katia de Paiva Lopes et al., 2020 40. Katia de Paiva Lopes, G.J.L.S. ∙ Humphrey, J. ∙ Allan, A. ..., Amber Berdenis van Berlekom Atlas of genetic effects in human microglia transcriptome across brain regions, aging and disease pathologies Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ).
To investigate common or unique pathways across population and isogenic models, we performed an unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 50. Langfelder, P. ∙ Horvath, S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis BMC Bioinf. 2008; 9 :559 Crossref Scopus (9406) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified significant module eigengenes (ME), representing module expression profiles, in population and isogenic comparisons of APOE4 versus APOE3 ( Figures 3 E–3G). Although the module-trait relationship of certain isogenic individuals was inconsistent with the population data due to strong microglia donor effects, similar enriched pathways (e.g., lipid metabolism, lysosome [MEred], and GPCR signaling [MEblue]) were observed in APOE4 microglia ( Figure 3 E). Consistent with population astrocytes, upregulated lipid metabolism (MElightcyan, MEdarkcyan) was the most significant in APOE4 isogenic astrocytes ( Figure 3 F). Actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion/endocytosis/axon guidance pathways (MEslatblue, MEsaddlebrown) were consistently downregulated in population and isogenic astrocytes. After cell-type proportion correction, matrisome (MEyellow, MElightcyan) were upregulated, while lipid metabolism (MEgreen), transcription, and translation (MEorange, MEdarkgoldenrod, MEdarkslatblue) were downregulated in APOE4 mixed cortical cultures (inconsistent in Indiv3) ( Figure 3 G). DEGs of APOE4 versus APOE3 astrocytes in the top dysregulated pathways, lipids, and focal adhesion/endocytosis showed similar patterns, while exhibiting individual variability ( Figure S3 B). fGSEA was applied to further interrogate inter-individual variation in isogenic cell types. Significantly more DEGs were observed in isogenics versus population ( Figure 3 H). However, DEGs across isogenic pairs varied greatly (individually and by cell type). Also, population enriched genes were driven by specific individuals rather than an equivalent contribution from everyone, e.g., lipid pathways driven from Indiv3 and 4 microglia and matrisome from Indiv1 and 4 mixed cortical cultures and astrocytes ( Figures S3 C–S3E). In each isogenic pair, uniquely enriched pathways highlighted genetic background, including APOE local haplotype influencing donor-specific APOE4 phenotypes.
WGCNA and fGSEA with population and isogenic data revealed that three of four individuals shared common microglia and astrocyte modules with a different outlier for each cell type (Indiv3 in microglia and Indiv4 in astrocytes) ( Figures 3 E and 3F). APOE expression was lower in APOE4 microglia and astrocytes compared to APOE3 for three individuals sharing common modules but higher in APOE4 for the outlier ( Figure S3 F), suggesting APOE expression underlies phenotypic variability. In APOE4 mixed-cortical-cultured astrocytes, APOE expression was lower ( Figure S3 F); cell-type deconvolution of AD brain transcriptome uncovered APOE4 -dependent decrease of APOE expression in microglia and most astrocytes ( Figure S4 D), implicating lower APOE levels in mediating APOE4 effects.
To test the hypothesis that decreased APOE drives APOE4 -dependent dysregulation, APOE KO hiPSCs were generated from Indiv1 and 2, sharing a common APOE local haplotype (hap.03) ( Figure 1 C). APOE KO was confirmed by sequencing and APOE protein expression in astrocytes ( Figure S3 G). Hierarchical clustering (top 500 DEGs) comparing APOE4 or APOE KO with APOE3 revealed that APOE KOs clustered by donor for all cell types ( Figure S3 H), suggesting that donor genetic background outweighs APOE loss of function (LOF). Indiv1 and 2 astrocytes clustered and were most similar ( Figure S3 H), suggesting APOE local haplotype dictates gene expression and is a major determinant in particular cell types. Furthermore, enriched modules of APOE KO mimicked APOE4 within the same individual ( Figures 3 E–3G), indicating that APOE4 is a LOF; however, individual genetic background ( APOE haplotype) rather than APOE LOF drives phenotype. The striking individual differences in APOE levels ( Figure S3 F) suggest that APOE cis-regulatory elements ( APOE enhancers/promoters) or APOE4 risk-modifying variants near the APOE locus rather than AD GRS (outliers do not possess high or low GRSs) contribute to the variability across cell types and individuals. This is also supported by APOE4 risk-modifying variants identified in APOE local admixture backgrounds in Hispanics and African Americans ( Rajabli et al., 2018 87. Rajabli, F. ∙ Feliciano, B.E. ∙ Celis, K. ... Ancestral origin of ApoE ε4 Alzheimer disease risk in Puerto Rican and African American populations PLoS Genet. 2018; 14 :e1007791 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by APOE expression modifiers such as variants in PVRL2 and APOC1 loci ( Zhou et al., 2019 125. Zhou, X. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Mok, K.Y. ... Non-coding variability at the APOE locus contributes to the Alzheimer's risk 10 :3310 Google Scholar ).
We used both population and multiple isogenic lines to evaluate each approach to increase the statistical power. Combined isogenic analysis with DESeq2 identified more DEGs than individual paired analysis using differential expression for repeated measures (DREAM) ( Hoffman and Roussos, 2020 32. Hoffman, G.E. ∙ Roussos, P. Dream: powerful differential expression analysis for repeated measures designs Bioinformatics. 2020; 37 :192-201 Crossref Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 H). Interestingly, isogenics with 24 lines (4 individuals × 6 clones/individual) yielded less statistical significance/power compared to population with 13 lines (13 individuals × 1 clone/individual) by WGCNA ( Figures 3 E–3G: column 1 versus 2). Individual clonal replicates did not increase power even after paired DREAM, which aligns with donor effects dominating transcriptomic variance but with clonal replicates per individual decreasing power in iPSC-based modeling ( Germain and Testa, 2017 26. Germain, P.L. ∙ Testa, G.

It stresses increasing the number of subjects rather than the number of isogenic clones from a few individuals to identify genotype-driven effects in understanding population genetics.
DEG analyses of AD versus control brain (Mount Sinai brain bank [MSBB]) uncovered the same matrisome enrichment found in APOE4 hiPSC-mixed cortical cultures ( Figure 4 A). Predicted functions of the matrisome gene set recapitulated the same modules: upregulated chemotaxis, inflammation, and lipid synthesis ( Figure 4 B). We hypothesized that enriched matrisome in APOE4 mixed cortical cultures is associated with astrocyte-neuron communication in the APOE4 brain ( Dzyubenko et al., 2016 21. Dzyubenko, E. ∙ Gottschling, C. ∙ Faissner, A. Neuron-glia interactions in neural plasticity: contributions of neural extracellular matrix and perineuronal nets Neural Plast. 2016; 2016 :5214961 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify which cell induces matrisome, whole brain transcriptomes were deconvoluted by microglia, astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and oligodendrocytes using cell-type-specific significance analysis of microarrays (csSAM) ( Shen-Orr et al., 2010 100. Shen-Orr, S.S. ∙ Tibshirani, R. ∙ Khatri, P. ... Cell type-specific gene expression differences in complex tissues Nat. Methods. 2010; 7 :287-289 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by DEG analysis ( APOE4 versus APOE3 ) ( Figure S4 A). Matrisome was enriched in APOE4 astrocytes in superior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus of MSBB and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of religious orders study-memory and aging project (ROSMAP) AD brain ( Figures 4 C–4F). APOE4 microglia were positively enriched for ECM, chemokine, and cytokine signaling pathways in all brain regions ( Figures 4 G–4J). Matrisome-associated gene sets are a matrisome subset in hiPSC-mixed cortical cultures and AD brain, and genes within the same category highly overlapped between different brain regions (∼65%) ( Figure S4 B). After cell-type deconvolution, APOE4 AD astrocytes displayed the same matrisome-associated modules: chemotaxis, inflammation, and lipid synthesis ( Figure 4 K). Predicted function of overlapping genes from APOE4 hiPSC-mixed cortical cultures, whole brain, and deconvoluted astrocytes include upregulation of the same three modules ( Figure 4 L). Next, we examined whether matrisome pathways were associated with AD, independent of APOE status. In APOE3 brains, matrisome was the most significantly upregulated pathway in AD versus control, with lower significance compared to APOE4 ( Figure S4 C), confirming APOE4 -driven matrisome enrichment. Combining APOE4 and AD, matrisome was enriched in deconvoluted astrocytes from all brain regions ( Figures S4 E–S4H and S4R). Further, cell-type-deconvoluted APOE4 neurons revealed positively enriched TCA cycle, respiratory electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation but negatively enriched ribosome in all brain regions ( Figures S4 M–S4Q), predicting mitochondrial and translational dysregulation.
We investigated whether enriched pathways in APOE4 hiPSC astrocytes and microglia can be identified in APOE4 AD brain cells. Deconvolved APOE4 astrocytes and microglia from the AD brain are positively enriched for cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis and other lipid metabolism while negatively enriched for HDL-mediated lipid transport and lysosome ( Figures 4 C–4J, S4 E–S4L, and S4R), consistent with the enrichment in APOE4 hiPSC astrocytes and microglia. Further, functional predictions reveal that positively enriched genes in lipid pathways in APOE4 brain astrocytes and microglia lead to increased cholesterol synthesis ( Figures 4 M and 4 N). Suppressed lysosomal genes in APOE4 microglia predict cholesterol/lipid accumulation and decreased lipid catabolism and cholesterol transport ( Figure 4 O). Thus, dysregulated lipid metabolism, including cholesterol synthesis in APOE4 hiPSC microglia and astrocytes, recapitulates changes observed in APOE4 brain microglia and astrocytes. Together, APOE4 hiPSC-mixed cortical cultures resemble human APOE4 AD brain, and the enriched common matrisome is associated with support of glia migration, inflammation, and lipid synthesis, derived from APOE4 astrocytes potentially via astrocyte-neuron crosstalk.
APOE -TR mice have been utilized to understand APOE4 risk in the context of AD pathology ( Shi et al., 2017 101. Shi, Y. ∙ Yamada, K. ∙ Liddelow, S.A. ... ApoE4 markedly exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in a mouse model of tauopathy Nature. 2017; 549 :523-527 Crossref Scopus (525) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tai et al., 2011 107.

Alzheimer's Dis. 2011; 2011 810981–81098 Crossref Google Scholar ), where microglia Apoe KO restores homeostasis from MGnD ( Krasemann et al., 2017 46. Krasemann, S. ∙ Madore, C. ∙ Cialic, R. ... The TREM2-APOE pathway drives the transcriptional phenotype of dysfunctional microglia in neurodegenerative diseases Immunity. 2017; 47 :566-581.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1038) PubMed Google Scholar ). Apoe KO mice are used as a human atherosclerosis model, in which the loss of Apoe alters macrophage cholesterol loading ( Zhang et al., 1992 120. Zhang, S.H. ∙ Reddick, R.L. ∙ Piedrahita, J.A. ... Spontaneous hypercholesterolemia and arterial lesions in mice lacking apolipoprotein E E. Science. 1992; 258 :468-471 Crossref Google Scholar ). To unravel glial-specific APOE4 effects in mouse models, transcriptomic analyses were performed on fetal microglia and astrocytes of APOE4 , APOE3 , Apoe KO, and Apoe wild type (WT). Cell-type-specific markers and Spearman correlation confirmed culture purity ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Apoe WT and Apoe KO cluster independently and distinctly from APOE3 and APOE4 , which were indistinguishable for each cell type ( Figures 5 B and 5C), suggesting mouse Apoe and human APOE functionally diverge. Altered astrocyte- and microglia-specific expression of Serpina3 and Wdly1 confirm prior APOE -TR whole brain studies but altered expressions of cell-type-specific gene isoforms highlight increased resolution with cell-type analyses ( Figures 5 D, 5E, and S5 A–S5D) ( Zhao et al., 2020b 123. Zhao, N. ∙ Ren, Y. ∙ Yamazaki, Y. ... Alzheimer's risk factors age, APOE genotype, and sex drive distinct molecular pathways Neuron. 2020; 106 :727-742.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following mouse-human gene conversion ( Figure S5 E), fGSEA performed on DEGs uncovered matrisome-associated, ECM-affiliated, interferon, and cytokine signaling pathways in APOE4 mouse microglia and astrocytes ( Figure 5 F) but lacked lipid-related dysregulation after functional analyses of the matrisome-associated pathway ( Figure 5 I). Thus, lipid metabolic dysregulation is human specific.
Assessment of Apoe KO versus APOE3 mouse microglia and astrocytes revealed cell-type-specific effects. Apoe KO microglia displayed enriched cholesterol biosynthesis and other lipid pathways, predicting upregulated lipid synthesis ( Figures 5 G and 5J). Apoe KO astrocytes showed enriched matrisome, enhancing chemotaxis and inflammation ( Figures 5 H and 5K). In all comparisons, both Apoe KO mouse microglia and astrocytes were positively enriched for lysosome with upregulated lipid catabolism ( Figures 5 G–5H, 5J–5K, and S5 F–S5I), which is discordant with APOE4 human cells. Lipid metabolic dysregulation in Apoe KO is less significant when compared to Apoe WT rather than APOE3 or APOE4 , and matrisome is not enriched in Apoe KO astrocytes but is in microglia ( Figures S5 H and S5I), suggesting mouse Apoe LOF does not mimic APOE4 in either species. Lastly, hierarchical clustering of genes expressed within the APOE locus (1 Mb near APOE ) showed marked differences between human and mouse microglia and astrocytes ( Figures S5 J and S5K), indicating that the regulatory machinery or architecture near the APOE locus differs between species.
Transcriptome analyses revealed decoupled cholesterol metabolism in APOE4 astrocytes and microglia predicted by increased intracellular cholesterol combined with increased de novo synthesis and decreased efflux. To investigate the mechanism, we interrogated whether APOE4 causes cholesterol trafficking deficits in two isogenic lines (Indiv1 and 2) sharing the same APOE haplotype (hap.03), with similar APOE4- driven expression signatures and lipid pathways enrichment ( Figures 1 C, 3 F, and S3 H). Isogenic APOE4 astrocytes showed 20% increased total cholesterol, derived from a free cholesterol pool, but not cholesteryl esters (CE), compared to APOE3 as measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) ( Muller et al., 2019 75. Müller, C. ∙ Junker, J. ∙ Bracher, F. ... A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based whole-cell screening assay for target identification in distal cholesterol biosynthesis Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :2546-2570 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 A). Further, intracellular free cholesterol levels measured with filipin ( Pipalia et al., 2011 85. Pipalia, N.H. ∙ Cosner, C.C. ∙ Huang, A. ... Histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment dramatically reduces cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick type C1 mutant human fibroblasts Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108 :5620-5625 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ) were significantly increased in APOE4 astrocytes, but donor fibroblasts did not exhibit genotype-dependent cholesterol differences (whole cells and lysosomes), potentially due to the lack of APOE ( Figures 6 B, 6C, and S6 A).
Elevated cellular cholesterol sensed within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) should cause retention of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), a master cholesterol regulator, thereby preventing SREBP2 translocation and its associated SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) to Golgi, where it is released by cleavage to activate genes for de novo cholesterol synthesis (e.g., β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-CoA [HMG-CoA] reductase [HMGCR]), uptake (e.g., low density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR]), and efflux (e.g., ABCA1 and ABCA7). However, causal network analysis of cholesterol biosynthesis predicted activated SREBF2 , SCAP , and HMGCR in APOE4 astrocytes and microglia ( Figures 2 F–2H). Cleaved SREBP2 (p < 0.001), SCAP (p < 0.05), and HMGCR (p < 0.05) were indeed elevated ( Figures 6 D, S6 B, and S6C), indicating increased de novo cholesterol biosynthesis despite elevated intracellular cholesterol in APOE4 astrocytes.
Although LDL significantly bound more cell surface receptors (e.g. LDLRs) in APOE4 astrocytes, highlighting increased cholesterol uptake potential ( Figure 6 E), LDL supplementation did not increase intracellular-free cholesterol in APOE4 compared to APOE3 over baseline ( Figures 6 B and 6C), suggesting cholesterol uptake is not the mechanism for increased cholesterol. Furthermore, external lipid (myelin) uptake via actin-dependent phagocytosis ( Gitik et al., 2011 27. Gitik, M. ∙ Liraz-Zaltsman, S. ∙ Oldenborg, P.A. ... Myelin down-regulates myelin phagocytosis by microglia and macrophages through interactions between CD47 on myelin and SIRPalpha (signal regulatory protein-alpha) on phagocytes J. Neuroinflammation. 2011; 8 :24 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) was significantly reduced in APOE4 astrocytes and microglia ( Figures 6 F and 6G).
In lysosomal storage diseases, lysosomal retention of cholesterol increases total cholesterol but reduces cholesterol in other organelles ( Schulze and Sandhoff, 2011 98. Schulze, H. ∙ Sandhoff, K. Lysosomal lipid storage diseases Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3 :a004804 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This occurs in acid sphingomyelinase deficiency ( SMPD 1 mutations) and Niemann-Pick type C disease ( NPC1 and NPC2 mutations) ( Parcon et al., 2018 81. Parcon, P.A. ∙ Balasubramaniam, M. ∙ Ayyadevara, S. ... Apolipoprotein E4 inhibits autophagy gene products through direct, specific binding to CLEAR motifs Alzheimers Dement. 2018; 14 :230-242 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Negatively enriched lysosome ( Figures 2 F and S3 D) and lower SMPD1 , NPC1 , and NPC2 in APOE4 versus APOE3 astrocytes ( Figure S6 D) indicate cholesterol transport out of lysosomes may be impaired by APOE4 . Filipin and TRITC-dextran co-localization (yellow puncta), a measure of lysosomal cholesterol ( Majumdar et al., 2007 64. Majumdar, A. ∙ Cruz, D. ∙ Asamoah, N. ... Activation of microglia acidifies lysosomes and leads to degradation of Alzheimer amyloid fibrils Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18 :1490-1496 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), was significantly increased (3-fold, p < 0.001) in APOE4 compared to APOE3 astrocytes, indicating that intracellular free cholesterol accumulates in lysosomes ( Figure 6 H). Levels of LAMP1/2, which are involved in NPC2 to NPC1 cholesterol export pathway from lysosome, were decreased in APOE4 astrocytes and microglia ( Figures S6 E and S6F) in which LAMP1 deficiency causes defective lysosome-ER cholesterol transport and lysosomal cholesterol accumulation ( Li and Pfeffer, 2016 53. Li, J. ∙ Pfeffer, S.R. Lysosomal membrane glycoproteins bind cholesterol and contribute to lysosomal cholesterol export Elife. 2016; 5 :e21635 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In AD brain, intracellular free cholesterol (filipin) and LAMP1 significantly co-localized in APOE4 hippocampal (vulnerable region involved in memory impairment), but not cortical astrocytes ( Figures S6 G and S6H) ( Kerchner et al., 2014 41.

APOE secretion facilitates cholesterol efflux ( Dove et al., 2005 20. Dove, D.E. ∙ Linton, M.F. ∙ Fazio, S. ApoE-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages: separation of autocrine and paracrine effects Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288 :C586-C592 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with reduced APOE transcripts in APOE4 versus APOE3 astrocytes and microglia, APOE protein was significantly lower (80% reduction) in APOE4 astrocytes and microglia ( Figures 6 I–6J, S6 I–S6J, S6M, and S6N). Expression of plasma membrane sterol transporters (ABCA1 and ABCA7) was significantly decreased in APOE4 astrocytes, although ABCA1 was similar in APOE4 versus APOE3 microglia ( Figures 6 K, S6 K, S6L, S6N, and S6O). Secreted APOE levels were decreased (63% reduction) in APOE4 versus APOE3 astrocytes ( Figures 6 I and S6 J), predicting reduced cholesterol secretion. Interestingly, the pan-APOE antibody detected differences between intracellular and extracellular APOE in astrocytes and between microglia and astrocytes ( Figures S6 J and S6 N), indicating post-translational modifications (glycosylation) may influence cell-type-specific APOE function.
When astrocytes were incubated with the cholesterol efflux acceptor HDL, the percent dehydroergosterol (DHE), a natural fluorescent sterol that mimics cellular/membrane cholesterol ( Maxfield and Wustner, 2012 66. Maxfield, F.R. ∙ Wustner, D. Analysis of cholesterol trafficking with fluorescent probes Methods Cell Biol. 2012; 108 :367-393 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ), remained significantly increased in APOE4 astrocytes after 24 h ( Figure S6 P), indicating that increased cholesterol is due to slower exchange to HDL. APOE4 astrocytes also exhibited reduced cholesterol efflux in the presence of 2% HDL and the cholesterol chelator methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD), a measure of the total available cholesterol in the plasma membrane using fluorescently labeled cholesterol ( Figure 6 L) ( Lopez et al., 2011 61. López, C.A. ∙ de Vries, A.H. ∙ Marrink, S.J. Molecular mechanism of cyclodextrin mediated cholesterol extraction PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7 :e1002020 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2011 119. Zhang, J. ∙ Cai, S. ∙ Peterson, B.R. ... Development of a cell-based, high-throughput screening assay for cholesterol efflux using a fluorescent mimic of cholesterol Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2011; 9 :136-146 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Maximal efflux by MBCD was significantly decreased in APOE4 microglia, although HDL-mediated efflux was not impaired ( Figure 6 M). Together, these data support a mechanism of dysregulated cholesterol metabolism due to lysosomal sequestration of free cholesterol away from ER that misinforms APOE4 cells to respond as if intracellular cholesterol levels are low, leading to upregulated de novo cholesterol synthesis. Further, reduced APOE and lipid transporters lead to a concomitant decrease in cholesterol efflux.
Next, we investigated whether decoupled lipid metabolism could be reversed by LXR agonists (GW3965 and T0901317), known to increase cholesterol efflux ( Peng et al., 2011 83. Peng, D. ∙ Hiipakka, R.A. ∙ Xie, J.T. ... A novel potent synthetic steroidal liver X receptor agonist lowers plasma cholesterol and triglycerides and reduces atherosclerosis in LDLR(-/-) mice Br. J. Pharmacol. 2011; 162 :1792-1804 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), reported to decrease cholesterol synthesis and increase ABCA1 and APOE ( Waltl et al., 2013 110. Waltl, S. ∙ Patankar, J.V. ∙ Fauler, G. ... 25-Hydroxycholesterol regulates cholesterol homeostasis in the murine CATH.a neuronal cell line Neurosci. Lett. 2013; 539 :16-21 Crossref Google Scholar ). Consistent with the reported mechanism, LXR agonists increased ABCA1 and APOE, and 25HC suppressed SREBF2 in APOE4 astrocytes ( Figures 6 N, S6 Q, and S6R). LXR agonists, but not 25HC, restored cholesterol efflux in APOE4 cells to levels of untreated APOE3 cells ( Figure 6 O). However, the efflux discrepancy between APOE4 versus APOE3 at baseline was still present after compound treatment alone or with HDL ( Figures 6 O and 6P). LXR agonists increased ABCA1 and APOE in APOE3 microglia but did not change APOE in APOE4 microglia ( Figures 6 Q and S6 S), highlighting differential cell-type responses to LXR agonists. Therefore, LXR agonists rescued decoupled lipid/cholesterol metabolism in APOE4 astrocytes, restoring efflux to APOE3 levels.
The most significantly and negatively enriched gene sets include regulation of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion/endocytosis in population and isogenic APOE4 astrocytes ( Figures 2 D and 3 F; MEsaddlebrown and MEslateblue) with most genes downregulated ( Figure S3 B [right]), predicting decreased projections and microvilli affecting cell attachment ( Figures S2 E and S2F). While APOE4 did not affect mature astrocyte size ( Figure S7 A), the attached cell surface area of APOE4 astrocytes was reduced in serum lipids as well as delipidated serum (dL-S) ( Figures 7 A and 7B), suggesting that APOE4 -driven actin cytoskeleton/focal adhesion defects manifest independently of lipid exposure. We confirmed enzymes (heat-inactivated serum [HI-S]) or other factors (KO serum replacement [KOSR] or cell density) were not driving the phenotype ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and S7 B–S7D). Furthermore, APOE4 astrocytes showed reduced expression of putative AD risk genes involved in actin cytoskeleton function ( ABI3 , FERMT , ELMO1 , MYBPC3 , ZYX , and DOCK2 ), NCK1 , which controls actin dynamics, and NCKAP1L ( Figure S7 E) ( Buvall et al., 2013 12. Buvall, L. ∙ Rashmi, P. ∙ Lopez-Rivera, E. ... Proteasomal degradation of Nck1 but not Nck2 regulates RhoA activation and actin dynamics Nat.

Integration of Alzheimer's disease genetics and myeloid genomics identifies disease risk regulatory elements and genes Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :1610 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). NCKAP1L (a.k.a. hematopoietic cell-specific actin regulatory protein [HEM-1]) interacts with ABI3, signals downstream of TREM2 and PLCG2, and functions in actin cytoskeleton reorganization during chemotaxis and efferocytosis ( Andreone et al., 2020 3.

Hem-1: putting the "WAVE" into actin polymerization during an immune response FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 :4923-4932 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite reports suggesting NCKAP1L , ABI3 , and DOCK2 are microglia specific, they were expressed in human astrocytes; NCKAP1L was marked decreased (4.3-fold) in APOE4 astrocytes ( Figure S7 E), suggesting decreased endocytosis ( Mooren et al., 2012 73. Mooren, O.L. ∙ Galletta, B.J. ∙ Cooper, J.A. Roles for actin assembly in endocytosis Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81 :661-686 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results corroborate reduced uptake of extracellular lipids ( Figures 6 F and 6G).
Cell-type deconvolution of AD brain uncovered enriched matrisome in APOE4 astrocytes. To narrow targets to assess in astrocytes in vitro , we designed Luminex multiplex immunoassays based on significantly enriched matrisome genes in isogenic APOE human astrocytes. Hierarchical clustering was APOE genotype-dependent and showed nearly half (24 of 45) were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) ( Figures 7 C, S7 F, and S7G). The top 12 DEPs, including SDF-1a (CXCL12), Gro-alpha/KC (CXCL1), MIP-1b (CCL4), Eotaxin (CCL11), IP-10 (CXCL10), RANTES (CCL5), IL-8, LIF, IL-6, VEGF-A, HGF, and VEGF-D were significantly higher in APOE4 astrocytes ( Figures 7 C–7F). Spearman correlation coefficient analysis of the 12 DEPs showed a stronger correlation in APOE3 relative to APOE4 astrocytes ( Figures S7 H–S7J).
To examine whether matrisome genes are enriched in mixed cortical cultures via astrocyte-neuron communication, chemokines were examined in mixed cortical cultures, mixed-cortical-cultured astrocytes, and pure astrocytes by Luminex. CXCL1 and CXCL10, upregulated in APOE4 mixed cortical cultures ( Figures 7 G and S7 K), were further enriched (2- to 2.5-fold) in mixed-cortical-cultured astrocytes versus pure astrocytes ( Figures 7 H, 7I, S7 L, and S7 M). Additionally, deconvoluted astrocytes from mixed cortical cultures highly correlated with pure astrocytes (95%–97%) ( Figure S7 N), supporting the notion that astrocyte-neuron communication drives the astrocyte matrisome signal.
Proinflammatory factors interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) are secreted by microglia and astrocytes, elevated in AD, and a subset of the matrisome signal ( Barcia et al., 2011 4. Barcia, C. ∙ Ros, C.M. ∙ Annese, V. ...

Voxel-based meta-analysis of grey matter changes in Alzheimer’s disease Ann. Transl. Med. 2015; 4 :136 Crossref Google Scholar ). Proinflammatory mediators IL6 , NOS2 , and HLA-DOB were upregulated in isogenic APOE4 astrocytes treated with IFNγ and TNFα ( Figures 7 J and 7K). IFNγ and TNFα upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis genes ( HMGCR , LDLR , and SREBF2 ) and downregulated efflux genes ( ABCA1 and ABCA7 ), but lysosome ( LAMP1 and LAMP2 ) and actin cytoskeleton regulation ( ABI3 and NCKAP1L ) were unchanged in APOE4 astrocytes ( Figures 7 J–7O). These data suggest that inflammation, as subset of matrisome enrichment in the APOE4 brain, exacerbates APOE4 astrocyte lipid dysregulation.
Together, APOE4 drives lysosomal cholesterol sequestration in astrocytes, which leads to lipid dysregulation by increasing cholesterol biosynthesis and decreasing efflux. Under homeostatic conditions, APOE4 astrocytes exhibit actin cytoskeletal defects independent of exogenous lipid exposure. Proinflammatory matrisome dysregulation is in part induced by APOE4 astrocyte-neuron communication and worsens lipid dysregulation including cholesterol biosynthesis and efflux.

Section: Discussion

Global transcriptomics and in vitro functional studies were employed to determine the impact of APOE4 in hiPSC-derived brain cell types from both population and multiple CRISPR-edited isogenic lines. Individual variability from population and isogenic analyses revealed that APOE4 -specific local haplotypes arise independently of APOE3 , and these diverse haplotypes contribute to the transcriptomic variation. Despite the variability due to genetic heterogeneity, cell-type-based transcriptomic analyses of hiPSC models, post-mortem AD brain, and APOE -TR mice identified human-specific dysregulation of lipid metabolism in APOE4 astrocytes and microglia and matrisome in APOE4 mixed cortical cultures and AD brain derived from astrocyte-neuron communication.
In vitro and in vivo studies identified intracellular cholesterol accumulation in APOE4 human astrocytes. Elevated gene sets and enzymes of cholesterol synthesis in APOE4 human astrocytes contradict the mechanism by which increased free cholesterol levels suppress gene expression via SREBP2 ( Brown and Goldstein, 2009 10. Brown, M.S. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. Cholesterol feedback: from Schoenheimer's bottle to Scap's MELADL J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50 :S15-S27 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because excess cholesterol is sequestered in lysosomes away from the ER, it prevents the appropriate SREBP2-mediated cholesterol regulation; increased cleaved SREBP2 upregulates cholesterol biosynthesis and cell surface lipid receptors to facilitate extracellular cholesterol uptake. However, uptake was dampened by actin cytoskeletal defects. Further, cholesterol accumulation is exacerbated by reduced cholesterol secretion and efflux due to lower levels of lipid carrier protein (e.g., APOE) and sterol transporters to HDL (e.g., ABCA1).
Previous studies identified APOE-isoform specific effects on cholesterol flux and APOE levels in rodent brain cells and human periphery ( Gong et al., 2002 28.

Exogenous APOE4 compared to APOE3 impaired cholesterol efflux in rat neurons, but not astrocytes ( Michikawa et al., 2000 69. Michikawa, M. ∙ Fan, Q.W. ∙ Isobe, I. ...

APOE4 -TR mouse neurons and astrocytes exhibit decreased cholesterol efflux compared to APOE3 , similar to our data. While APOE mRNA levels were unchanged in mouse ( Gong et al., 2002 28. Gong, J.S. ∙ Kobayashi, M. ∙ Hayashi, H. ... Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoform-dependent lipid release from astrocytes prepared from human ApoE3 and ApoE4 knock-in mice J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :29919-29926 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), APOE4 human astrocytes and microglia exhibited a cell autonomous decrease in APOE transcript and protein in vitro and in vivo. APOE transcript levels were similar between astrocytes and microglia, but APOE protein levels were lower in microglia compared to astrocytes ( Figures 6 I, 6J, S6 I, and S6M). However, increased APOE protein degradation ( Riddell et al., 2008 92. Riddell, D.R. ∙ Zhou, H. ∙ Atchison, K. ... Impact of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphism on brain ApoE levels J. Neurosci. : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience. 2008; 28 :11445-11453 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) or reduced APOE uptake in microglia compared to astrocytes cannot be excluded. The effect of endogenous versus exogenous APOE on cellular phenotypes, and the role of different post-translational APOE modifications in microglia and astrocytes require further studies.
Our human specific findings underscore an important caveat of studying the role of APOE genotype using APOE -TR mice, which are genetically chimeric, i.e., contain the mouse 5′ regulatory region but human exons 2–4 ( Knouff et al., 1999 44.

Neurochem. 2007; 103 :1237-1257 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study highlights gene expression, gene regulatory, and functional differences exhibited between humans and mice that necessitate the examination of AD genetic risk factors, like APOE4 in human models ( Geirsdottir et al., 2020 23.

Recent studies highlight microglial lipid dysregulation attributed to AD genetic risk. TREM2 or PLCG2 KO impaired lipid metabolism where CEs accumulate in microglia ( Andreone et al., 2020 3. Andreone, B.J. ∙ Przybyla, L. ∙ Llapashtica, C. ... Alzheimer's-associated PLCgamma2 is a signaling node required for both TREM2 function and the inflammatory response in human microglia Nat. Neurosci. 2020; Google Scholar ; Nugent et al., 2020 79. Nugent, A.A. ∙ Lin, K. ∙ van Lengerich, B. ... TREM2 regulates microglial cholesterol metabolism upon chronic phagocytic challenge Neuron. 2020; 105 :837-854.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hypomorphic TREM2 R47H increases CE accumulation, while protective, hypermorphic PLCG2 P552R reduces CE accumulation in microglia, supporting an APOE-TREM2-PLCγ2 signaling axis required for recycling lipid-containing debris. Our observation of reduced de novo APOE synthesis and cholesterol efflux/secretion by APOE4 predisposes microglia to dampened APOE-TREM2-PLCγ2 signaling. Upon accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and neuronal debris with age, reduced APOE-TREM2 signaling in microglia accelerates lipid metabolic dysregulation and an inflammatory state that increase AD risk.
We uncovered altered matrisome, ECM, and immune pathways by APOE4 in hiPSC-mixed cortical cultures and AD brain, identifying astrocytes as a key driver of this signal through cell-type deconvolution analyses, likely arising from astrocyte-neuron communication in APOE4 brain, stressing human astrocyte-specific non-cell autonomous dysregulation. Upregulated ECM caused by astrogliosis is associated with amyloid plaques in AD and glial scar formation after CNS injury, creating a mechanical barrier for neurite outgrowth ( Bovolenta et al., 1997 7. Bovolental, P. ∙ Fernaud-Espinosa, I. ∙ Mendez-Otero, R. ... Neurite outgrowth inhibitor of gliotic brain tissue. Mode of action and cellular localization, studied with specific monoclonal antibodies Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9 :977-989 Crossref Google Scholar ; Pike et al., 1995 84. Pike, C.J. ∙ Cummings, B.J. ∙ Cotman, C.W. Early association of reactive astrocytes with senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease Exp. Neurol. 1995; 132 :172-179 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The APOE4 mixed cortical model recapitulates some aspects of the AD brain environment and implicates a reactive astrocyte state that upregulates ECM, cytokines, and growth factors. Enriched matrisome includes increased chemotaxis, inflammation, and lipid synthesis (like pure astrocytes), and the proinflammatory state promotes cholesterol biosynthesis but impedes efflux, suggesting APOE4 alters matrisome signaling to exacerbate lipid dyshomeostasis.
Recent hiPSC genetic modeling efforts have utilized either a pooled patient iPSC strategy to uncover disease phenotypes in the context of patient genetic heterogeneity or a comprehensive isogenic platform to assess the effect of disease mutations by limiting genetic background variation ( Lim et al., 2020 56.

We employed both population and isogenic cell-type-based models and factored in GRS and APOE local haplotype to address the genetic complexity underlying human APOE4 risk to model AD. Our well-powered hiPSC study identified common and divergent pathways when compared to earlier APOE4 hiPSC studies ( Lin et al., 2018 57. Lin, Y.T. ∙ Seo, J. ∙ Gao, F. ...

Wang et al. (2018a) 111. Wang, C. ∙ Najm, R. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Gain of toxic apolipoprotein E4 effects in human iPSC-derived neurons is ameliorated by a small-molecule structure corrector Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :647-657 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar characterized APOE4 neuronal phenotypes in 6 subjects and a single clone of each genotype from one isogenic pair. Using the same cortical neuron protocol as our study, the neurons studied are likely a mixed neuron/astrocyte population, although RNA sequencing was not performed. Using technical replicates from one isogenic pair, Lin et al. (2018) reported intracellular free cholesterol accumulation in APOE4 astrocytes, consistent with our data, but identified downregulated cholesterol biosynthesis, opposing our data. Examining two isogenic pairs, Sienski et al. (2021) showed that APOE4 astrocytes were choline deficient, causing increased unsaturated fatty acids and lipid droplet accumulation in which choline supplementation restored the cellular lipidome to its basal state. Population and most isogenic APOE4 astrocytes upregulate choline kinase alpha ( CHKA ) ( Figure S3 B), which incorporates choline into phosphocholine in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis ( Wu et al., 2008 116. Wu, G. ∙ Aoyama, C. ∙ Young, S.G. ... Early embryonic lethality caused by disruption of the gene for choline kinase alpha, the first enzyme in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :1456-1462 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our population and isogenic studies identified common APOE genotype-phenotypes across individuals with opposing effects in certain individuals, which highlight the complexity of the interaction between APOE4 and genetic background in different cell types that cannot be examined with a single isogenic pair. Despite performing GRS analysis to select hiPSCs and further incorporating this genetic variation as a covariate in analyses to minimize the contribution of other AD risk loci, pathway divergences still emerged in which one individual showed discordance but in different cell types ( Figures 3 E–3G). The pathway discordance aligned with APOE expression ( Figure S3 F). Variance in APOE levels may be due to differences in APOE local haplotype for each individual and differing gene regulation in different cell types, leading to cell-type-specific individual variation. Further functional genomic dissection of the APOE locus is needed to identify haplotype-specific differences in APOE regulation in different cell types. APOE4 resembles APOE LOF ( Figure S3 H); thus, modulating gene expression may be an alternative to study disease-associated polymorphisms. However, APOE LOF is limited to particular individuals, suggesting that individual donor genetics dominate over single risk allele conversion or KO in isogenics, which results in discordant outcomes among studies.
An important question that emerges from our study is how to best incorporate human genetic heterogeneity in modeling common AD genetic risk. APOE4 has a strong odds ratio (OR) in non-Hispanic Europeans (OR = 14.9), whereas APOE4 risk varies substantially across populations (African Americans and Caribbean Hispanics, OR = 2.2–5.7 and East Asians, OR = 11.8–33.1) ( Liu et al., 2014 60. Liu, M. ∙ Bian, C. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease in Chinese population: a meta-analysis Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :4383 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tang et al., 1998 108. Tang, M.X. ∙ Stern, Y. ∙ Marder, K. ... The APOE-epsilon4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer disease among African Americans, whites, and Hispanics JAMA. 1998; 279 :751-755 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the risk is modulated at least in part on differing ancestral haplotypes across the APOE locus ( Rajabli et al., 2018 87. Rajabli, F. ∙ Feliciano, B.E. ∙ Celis, K. ... Ancestral origin of ApoE ε4 Alzheimer disease risk in Puerto Rican and African American populations PLoS Genet. 2018; 14 :e1007791 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that the impact of APOE4 is haplotype dependent. Since APOE local haplotypes exist in an APOE genotype-dependent manner ( Figure 1 D), the generation of isogenic APOE lines creates novel haplotypes. The discordant phenotypes due to APOE4 among studies may result from introducing APOE ε3 or ε4 into different haplotypic backgrounds, while clonal variability < individual variability. These observations have important implications for modeling GWAS variants more broadly. To date, most isogenic studies have focused on high-penetrance Mendelian disease-causing variants where haplotypes may not be a factor. However, we show that for a strong genetic risk factor like APOE4 , genetic heterogeneity including haplotype eclipses APOE alone. This is likely more problematic for other GWAS signals with lower ORs and more ambiguous evidence for causal variants. Indeed, it is likely that for many GWAS loci, the risk is imparted by haplotypes rather than individual SNPs, as is evident by high correlation of local haplotypes and SNPs at a global level of the human genome ( Jakobsson et al., 2008 36. Jakobsson, M. ∙ Scholz, S.W. ∙ Scheet, P. ... Genotype, haplotype and copy-number variation in worldwide human populations Nature. 2008; 451 :998-1003 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), making isogenic approaches more challenging. Although cell-type-dependent penetrance of disease risk variants and the number of individuals necessary to model the risk variants need to be resolved on a case-by-case basis, the strength of a population model over isogenics need to be considered based on haplotypes for non-Mendelian genetic risk cases.
In summary, we demonstrate human-specific and AD brain cell-type-dependent transcriptional and cellular phenotypes of APOE4 , uncovering major deficits in lipid homeostasis and glial activation. These studies suggest that therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring glial lipid homeostasis and inflammation may be beneficial for AD, particularly in APOE4 carriers.
A caveat of our study arises from the nature of hiPSC models, which remove the “age”-associated epigenetic signatures that may contribute significantly to AD progression ( Mertens et al., 2021 68. Mertens, J. ∙ Herdy, J.R. ∙ Traxler, L. ... Age-dependent instability of mature neuronal fate in induced neurons from Alzheimer's patients Cell Stem Cell. 2021; 28 :1533-1548.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is also under-investigated whether iPSC reprogramming removes “pathological phenotypes.” One challenge was collecting an equal number of cases versus controls for each APOE genotype to confirm that differences were attributed to APOE4 , but not unknown effects of disease status. Other disease relevant genetic factors (GRSno APOE , APOE local haplotype) were considered in our model; however, aging or epigenetics cannot be recapitulated in hiPSC models yet. For example, enriched matrisome is not only driven by APOE4 genotype but also by AD pathological phenotypes in the context of APOE3 ; however, our hiPSC study could only model APOE genotype, but not AD neuropathological phenotypes or age. Thus, how APOE4 manifests in the context of neurodegeneration and aging are important unresolved questions worth exploring to better understand human AD pathogenesis.
Since altered matrisome pathways in astrocytes from AD brain were recapitulated in APOE4 hiPSC-mixed cortical cultures, incorporating microglia in 2D may more faithfully model the in vivo context. A recent 3D organoid model exhibits increased AD-related Aβ and APOE4 -dependent tau pathology, ( Zhao et al., 2020a 122. Zhao, J. ∙ Fu, Y. ∙ Yamazaki, Y. ... APOE4 exacerbates synapse loss and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease patient iPSC-derived cerebral organoids Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5540 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) in which adding microglia ( Abreu et al., 2018 1. Abreu, C.M. ∙ Gama, L. ∙ Krasemann, S. ... Microglia increase inflammatory responses in iPSC-derived human BrainSpheres Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9 :2766 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2018 57.

Moreover, BMECs did not exhibit a cell autonomous APOE4 phenotype, which is consistent with altered endothelial phenotypes that arose only after modulation by brain pericytes ( Blanchard et al., 2020 6. Blanchard, J.W. ∙ Bula, M. ∙ Davila-Velderrain, J. ... Reconstruction of the human blood-brain barrier in vitro reveals a pathogenic mechanism of APOE4 in pericytes Nat.

Biol. 2020; 40 :128-144 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these observations highlight the value of co-culture and organoid systems to extract the impact of APOE4 in complex cellular environments.

hiPSCs lines balanced for sex ( Table S1 ) were generated by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, UCI ADRC, WashU ADRC Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Core from subject fibroblasts with approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and human Stem Cell Research Oversight (hSCRO) committee protocols. The consent for reprogramming human somatic cells to hiPSC was carried out on hSCRO protocol 19-04 (J.TCW.), 2013-9561 and 2017-1061 (W.W.P.). Informed consent was received by each of the participants who donated fibroblasts. hiPSCs were maintained on Matrigel (Corning) in mTeSR1 (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with 10 ng/mL FGF2 StemBeads (StemCultures). hiPSCs in passage range from 12-21 were differentiated to NPCs by dual SMAD inhibition (0.1μM LDN193189 and 10μM SB431542) in embryoid bodies (EB) media (DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, 10565), 1x N2 (Invitrogen, 17502-048), and 1x B27-RA (Invitrogen, 12587-010)). Rosettes were selected at 14 DIV by Rosette Selection Reagent (StemCell Technologies) and patterned to forebrain NPCs with EB media containing 20 ng/mL FGF2 (Invitrogen). NPCs (CD271 - /CD133 + ) were enriched by magnetic activated cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec) ( Bowles et al., 2019 8. Bowles, K.R. ∙ TCW, J. ∙ Qian, L. ... Reduced variability of neural progenitor cells and improved purity of neuronal cultures using magnetic activated cell sorting PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0213374 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and validated immunocytochemically using SOX2 (Cell signaling, 3579 S), PAX6 (Abcam, ab5790), FOXP2 (Abcam, ab16046), and NESTIN (Abcam, ab22035). Dissociated single cell forebrain NPCs (15,000 cells/cm 2 ) were differentiated to astrocytes in astrocyte medium (ScienCell, 1801) on Matrigel as described ( TCW et al., 2017 109. TCW, J. ∙ Wang, M. ∙ Pimenova, A.A. ... An efficient platform for astrocyte differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells Stem Cell Rep. 2017; 9 :600-614 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were continually passaged at 95% confluency and harvested as astrocytes at 30 DIV, validated immunocytochemically and/or by FACS for the astrocyte-specific markers and used for subsequent experiments.
Forebrain NPCs were dissociated with Accutase (Millipore) and re-plated on Matrigel at 42,000 cells/cm 2 . After 24 h, media was replaced with BrainPhys media (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic, 1x N2, 1x B27, 20 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 20 ng/ml glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), 250ug/ml dibutyryl cyclic AMP sodium salt (cAMP) (Sigma) and 200μM L-Ascorbic acid (AA) (Sigma) as described ( Bardy et al., 2015 5. Bardy, C. ∙ van den Hurk, M. ∙ Eames, T. ... Neuronal medium that supports basic synaptic functions and activity of human neurons in vitro Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112 :E2725-E2734 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells cultured for six weeks were used for all experiments.
hiPSCs cultured in either mTeSR or E8 (StemCell Technologies) were differentiated to hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and subsequently to microglia. Single cell hiPSCs were cultured in hypoxia (20% O 2 , 20% CO 2 ) at 37°C with 50 ng/ml FGF2 (Peprotech) and 50 ng/ml BMP4 (Peprotech), 12.5 ng/ml Activin A (Peprotech), 2 mM LiCl (Peprotech) during days 0-2 and 50 ng/ml FGF2 and 50 ng/ml VEGF (Peprotech) for days 2-4 in basal HPC medium (50% IMDM (Gibco), 50% F12 (Gibco), 0.02 mg/mL insulin (Sigma), 2% v/v ITSG-X (Gibco), 64 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 400 μM monothioglycerol (MTG) (Sigma), 10 μg/mL PVA (Sigma), 1x GlutaMax (Gibco), 1x Chemically-defined lipid concentrate (Gibco), 1x non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco), 1% v/v Antibiotic-Antimycotic) to generate EBs as described previously ( Abud et al., 2017 2. Abud, E.M. ∙ Ramirez, R.N. ∙ Martinez, E.S. ... iPSC-derived human microglia-like cells to study neurological diseases Neuron. 2017; 94 :278-293.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (453) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBs were transferred to normoxia for another 6 days in basal HPC media supplemented with 50 ng/ml of each FGF2, VEGF, TPO and IL6, and 10 ng/ml of each SCF and IL3. At day 10, HPCs were collected in the absence of FACS, filtered through a 45 μm cell strainer (Fisher Scientific), and plated onto Matrigel-coated 6-well plates (200,000 cells/well). HPCs were cultured in microglia basal medium (DMEM/F12, 1x Glutamax, 1x NEAA, 2% v/v ITS-G, 2% v/v B27, 0.5% v/v N2, 200uM MTG, 5ug/ml Insulin) with 50 ng/mL TGFβ (Peprotech), 100 ng/mL IL-34 (Peprotech) and 25 ng/mL M-CSF (Peprotech) for 25 days, and then cultured in microglia basal medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL CX3CL1 (Peprotech) and 100 ng/mL CD200 (Novaprotein) for an additional three days, and harvested on day 28 for analysis. HPCs were validated by FACS for CD43 + (>98%) and CD41 + /CD235a + /CD45 - (Biolegend) while microglia were validated by immunocytochemistry with microglia-specific markers.
BMECs were generated as described ( Lippmann et al., 2014 58. Lippmann, E.S. ∙ Al-Ahmad, A. ∙ Azarin, S.M. ... A retinoic acid-enhanced, multicellular human blood-brain barrier model derived from stem cell sources Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :4160 Crossref Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, hiPSCs were plated as evenly dispersed single cells on Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates. Cells were maintained in E8 at 37°C in 5% CO 2 with daily media change until 70% confluent and subsequently switched to unconditioned media (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/Ham’s F12 (Gibco) with 20% Knock-Out Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% NEAA, 0.836 μM beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and 5% GlutaMAX and cultured until a monolayer exhibiting distinct morphological changes formed (3-5 days). Next, cells were cultured in basal EC media (Human Endothelial Serum-Free Media (ThermoFisher) with 1% human platelet poor derived serum (Sigma)) supplemented with 20 ng/mL bFGF (Peprotech) and 10 μg/mL retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma) for 24 h, followed by incubation in EC media lacking bFGF for another 24 h, and then cultured in basal EC media for an additional 48 h. Afterward, cells were dissociated into single cells (Tryple Express (Gibco)) and plated onto either 24-well plates coated with 400 μg/mL collagen IV (Sigma)/100 μg/mL fibronectin (Sigma) in H 2 O mixture overnight in an incubator. Resultant BMECs were cultured in EC media for an additional 24 h prior to experiments.
All animal procedures and experiments were performed under guidelines approved by the animal studies committee at Washington University School of Medicine (D.M.H. protocol: 20180139). Mixed glia were obtained at P2 from human APOE targeted replacement mice (C57BL/6, provided by Dr. Patrick M. Sullivan) or Apoe knockout (C57BL/6, Jackson Laboratory, 002052) and wild type mice (C57BL/6, Charles River, 027). Mouse cortices balanced for sex (52% female, sex per each brain is labeled in the GEO metadata in the key resource table) were dissected in Hanks' Balanced Salt solution (HBSS without Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ). After meninges removal, tissue was digested in 0.25% trypsin (GIBCO, 15090-046) and 0.2 mg/ml DNase (Sigma, DN-25) at 37°C for 10 min, washed with HBSS, and dissociated in HBSS containing 0.4 mg/ml DNase using fire-polished Pasteur glass pipettes followed by filtration through a 70-μm nylon mesh. Cells were pelleted (1,000 g, 5 min), washed with glial medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1xPen/strep, 1xGlutamax), and plated onto 10 μg/mL Poly-L-lysine (Sigma, P2636)-coated 10 cm tissue culture dishes in glial medium, followed by medium replacement on the second day. After cells reached confluency, they were cultured for an additional 5-7 days with fresh glial media supplement to allow for microglia proliferation atop astrocytes. Microglia were flushed off the astrocyte layer via pipetting and plated (62,500 cells/cm 2 ) in glial medium. Astrocytes were collected by trypsinization and replated (52,000 cells/cm 2 ). Astrocytes and microglia were cultured in hiPSC-astrocyte (ScienCell) and hiPSC-microglia media (IL34, TGFβ, M-CSF for 4 days, followed by CX3CL and CD200 for 3 days) for 7 days respectively to mimic the human cell culture conditions. Microglia and astrocytes were purified from 22 mouse fetal brains of APOE 44 (N = 6), APOE 33 (N = 6), Apoe WT (N = 6) and Apoe KO (N = 4) mice.
TCW1 (female) and TCW2 (male) ( Table S4 ) were generated as described ( Ran et al., 2013 89. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (6079) PubMed Google Scholar ) by the ‘CORRECT’ scarless gene-editing method ( Paquet et al., 2016 80. Paquet, D. ∙ Kwart, D. ∙ Chen, A. ... Efficient introduction of specific homozygous and heterozygous mutations using CRISPR/Cas9 Nature. 2016; 533 :125-129 Crossref Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the CRISPR Design tool ( http://crispr.mit.edu ) was used to identify the sgRNA 5′-CCTCGCCGCGGTACTGCACCAGG-3′, which was cloned into the pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9-GFP (PX338) plasmid (Addgene, 42230). The correct APOE sgRNA sequence orientation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9- APOE sgRNA plasmid cleavage efficiency was determined using the Surveyor mutation detection kit in 293 T cells. The single-strand oligo-deoxynucleotide (ssODN) was designed to convert APOE ε4 to APOE ε3 with a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) silent mutation to prevent recurrent Cas9 editing. Three clones that have indel or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) screened by Sanger sequencing were selected as APOE knockout lines. Potential off-targets (quality score ≥ 0.5) for the designed gRNA were confirmed negative. hiPSCs (70 - 80% confluent) dissociated by Accutase supplemented with 10 uM Thiazovivin (Tzv) (Millipore), were harvested (200 x g, 3 min), and electroporated (Neon®, ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells resuspended in 10 μL Neon Resuspension Buffer R, 1 μg CRISPR-Cas9- APOE sgRNA plasmid and 1μL of 10μM of ssODN were electroporated, then plated on Matrigel-coated plates in mTeSR media with 10 μM Tzv for 72 h. GFP-expressing hiPSC were isolated by FACS (BD FACSAria). Sorted single cells were suspended in mTeSR with Tzv and plated into 96 well plates containing MEFs. Clones were expanded and transferred to a replicate plate for gDNA isolation and Sanger sequencing to identify genome edited clones. For TCW3 (male) and TCW4 (female) ( Table S4 ), isogenics were generated via nucleofection of Cas9-sgRNA RNP complexes ( Kim et al., 2014 43. Kim, S. ∙ Kim, D. ∙ Cho, S.W. ... Highly efficient RNA-guided genome editing in human cells via delivery of purified Cas9 ribonucleoproteins Genome Res. 2014; 24 :1012-1019 Crossref Scopus (1074) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the sgRNA (PNAbio) and ssODN (Sigma) were designed using an online tool ( https://www.deskgen.com/guidebook/ ). The ssODN included base pair changes to switch APOE genotype and silent mutations to remove both the PAM sequence and a Not I restriction site to facilitate homozygous gene editing and clone selection, respectively. To validate the sgRNA, hiPSC lines pre-equilibrated in E8 supplemented with 2μM Tzv for 1 h were processed to single cells, nucleofected (Amaxa) with recombinant Cas9 (PNAbio)-sgRNA complexes prepared on ice (20 min) and analyzed using the DNA Guide-it™ Mutation Detection Kit according to manufacturer. For isogenic generation, 1 nmol ssODN was pre-incubated with 4.5 μg Cas9 and 6 μg sgRNA complex prior to nucleofection. Following transfection (after 48 h), hiPSCs were processed into single cells and sorted by FACS into Matrigel-coated 96 well plates using SSEA4-FITC (Biolegend) and individual clones expanded in E8 supplemented with Tzv for 3d, followed by E8 only. After clonal expansion, isolated genomic DNA was used as a template to amplify an APOE fragment by PCR to screen for loss of the NotI restriction site. DNA from clones lacking a NotI restriction site were subjected to Taqman SNP genotyping and gene editing validated by Sanger sequencing to identify homozygous gene-edited hiPSCs.
Fixed tissue samples from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were obtained from the tissue repository at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of California Irvine. Human tissue collection and handling adhered to the University of California, Irvine, Institutional Review Board guidelines. Neuropathologic diagnosis of AD was in accordance with current NIA-AA guidelines ( Hyman et al., 2012 35. Hyman, B.T. ∙ Phelps, C.H. ∙ Beach, T.G. ... National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines for the neuropathologic assessment of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimers Dement. 2012; 8 :1-13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1434) PubMed Google Scholar ; Montine et al., 2012 72.

National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines for the neuropathologic assessment of Alzheimer's disease: a practical approach Acta Neuropathol. 2012; 123 :1-11 Crossref Scopus (1428) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and a solution of PBS with 0.02% sodium azide was used for long-term storage. Two groups were included in this study based on their APOE status and matched for sex, age, disease status, and postmortem interval (PMI) ( Table S8 ). Clinical data were not incorporated into the present study.
G-banding karyotyping of all hiPSC lines was performed by Wicell Cytogenetics (Madison, WI).
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C for 10 min. hiPSCs and differentiated CNS cells were permeabilized (1.0% Triton in PBS) at room temperature for 15 min and blocked in 5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton at room temperature for 30 min. The primary antibodies used for hiPSC-astrocytes were 1:1,000 anti-S100β (Sigma-Aldrich, S2532), 1:500 anti-Vimentin (Cell Signaling, R28#3932), 1:500 anti-NFIA (Active Motif, 39398), 1:100 anti-GLAST/EAAT1 (BOSTER, PA2185), 1:100 anti-ALDH1L2 (Novusbio, NBP1-81935), and 1:500 anti-AQP4 (Alomone Labs, AQP-004), for hiPSC-mixed cortical cultures were 1: 400 anti-MAP2AB (Sigma, M1406), 1: 1,000 TUJ1 (Biolegend, 802001), 1:500 anti-TH1 (Pel-Freez Biologicals, P40101), and 1:500 anti-GABA (Sigma; A2052), for hiPSC-microglia were 2 μg/ml anti-CX3CR1 (BioRad, AHP1589), for both hiPSC-microglia and mouse microglia were 1:300 anti-IBA1 (Sigma, MABN92), 10ug/ml anti-TREM2 (R&D, AF1828), 1:1,000, anti-P2RY12 (Sigma, HPA014518), and 1:100 PU.1 (Cell Signaling, 2266) and for hiPSC-BMECs were 1:100 anti-Claudin-5 (ThermoFisher, 4C3C2), 1:200 anti-ZO-1 (ThermoFisher, 402200), and 1:200 anti-Occludin (ThermoFisher, OC-3F10). For mouse astrocytes, 1:1,000 anti-GFAP (Millipore, MAB3402), 1:400 anti-EAAT1 (GeneTex, GTX134060), and 1:1,000 anti-ALDH1L1 (Abcam, ab190298). For hiPSC, anti-Nanog (Cell signaling, 4903 S), anti-OCT4 (Cell signaling, 2840 S), anti-TRA1-60 (Cell signaling, 4746P), and anti-TRA1-81 (Cell signaling, 4745P). For matrisome assessment, 5 μg/ml IGF2 (Abcam, ab9574), 1:50 IP-10 (Abcam, ab8098), and 5 μg/ml GRO (Abcam, 86436) were used. Secondary antibodies used were 1:300 Alexa donkey 488 and 568 anti-rabbit, mouse, or chicken (Life Technologies). DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 0.5 μg/mL) was used to visualize nuclei. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX51 Fluorescence Microscope, a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope or Cytation 5 imager. Multiple biological and technical replicates (6 images per slide from n = 3 independent lines per genotype) of images were taken using a 20× magnification objective from mixed cortical cultures, pure astrocytes and microglia. Total integrated intensity of the whole images is measured by subtracting background intensity from total intensity and then normalized by DAPI counts to measure per cell based normalized intensity by ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 97. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (33235) PubMed Google Scholar ). To capture the entire astrocyte ROIs, sum of intensity of neuron ROIs were subtracted from total integrated intensity and then corrected it by substracting background intensity. It is also normalized by astrocyte DAPI counts which is derived from neuron DAPI subtracted from total DAPI counts.
Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured for five consecutive days from BMECs (1,500,000 cells/cm 2 ) grown in EC media supplemented with retinoic acid (5 μg/mL) on coated Transwells (0.33cm 2 , 0.4 μm, Corning) using an EVOM2 Voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments) according to manufacturer with daily media change. For each BMEC line, experiments were carried out in triplicate. TEER values were obtained by averaging two readings from each well and subtracting the blank (media only Transwells). Values are expressed as resistance per cm 2 .
Isogenic APOE astrocytes were plated (200,000 cells/well of 6-well-plate) in serum-free astrocyte media. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with HBSS, and cellular lipids extracted with hexane-isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) ( Shiratori et al., 1994 102. Shiratori, Y. ∙ Okwu, A.K. ∙ Tabas, I. Free cholesterol loading of macrophages stimulates phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and up-regulation of CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 :11337-11348 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extract was divided into two fractions, one-third was used for free cholesterol (FC) and remaining two-thirds was used for total cholesterol (TC) estimation. Both fractions were first dried under an Argon stream. The dried fraction retained for FC was resuspended in hexane for Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The fraction retained for TC was hydrolyzed using 50% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution to convert cholesteryl ester (CE) into FC. The FC generated was extracted by solvent separation from KOH solution using hexane. Free and total cholesterol were analyzed by GC-MS on a HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard) equipped with a flame-ionization detector. Lipids were separated on a HP-5 capillary column (15 m × 0.53 mm) coated with 5% phenyl methyl siloxane (1.5 μm) in which the injection temperature was maintained at 255°C, the oven temperature was isothermally held at 260°C and using a helium mobile phase (30 mL/min flow rate). The astrocyte FC content in each well was quantified using β-sitosterol as an internal standard. After lipid extraction, cells were lysed in 0.1 M NaOH, and the protein content of each well (μg protein/well) was determined using the DC protein kit (Bio-Rad). The FC content of each well was normalized to the corresponding protein concentration. The CE levels were estimated by subtracting FC from TC values. Experimental results are presented as fractions of control.
Isogenic APOE astrocytes were plated (20,000 cells/cm 2 ) in serum-free astrocyte medium and either treated with or without LDL for 24 h. Intracellular FC was determined by fluorescence. Cultured astrocytes were fixed, and FC was labeled with filipin (50 μg/mL in PBS for 45 min at room temperature), followed by 3x wash with PBS, and acquiring images by widefield fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystems, Germany) using a 20× objective and standard A4 UV filter with 17% neutral density to measure filipin fluorescence intensity, thus subjecting the cells to minimum exposure to avoid photobleaching. We observed less than 1% bleaching in fluorescence intensity per exposure (data not shown). In each experiment 20 images were acquired, and each image had 10 - 20 cells in the field. In order to avoid bias, different pairs of APOE3 and APOE4 clones were used. Thus, with three clones in each of the APOE3 and APOE4 lines, nine combinations were tested. Experiments were repeated at least twice per pair. For imaging, cellular FC content was determined using Metamorph Discovery-1 image-analysis software. Background was subtracted from each shading-corrected image by determining the fifth percentile intensity value of the image and subtracting this value from each pixel in the image. At the plating density used, all fields were 50-70% confluent in imaged areas. Next, a low threshold was applied to include all areas occupied by cells. The outline of cells using the selected values were comparable to cell outlines in transmitted light images. For the average cellular FC, the low threshold was used to measure total filipin intensity above the threshold and was divided by the number of pixels above the lower threshold for each field to yield the average filipin intensity/cell area. All data were normalized to APOE3 control within each experiment.
Isogenic APOE astrocytes were grown in serum free astrocyte media on poly-D-lysine-coated coverslip bottom of 35 mm dishes for 48 h. Astrocytes were then incubated with Alexa546- labeled LDL ( Pipalia et al., 2017 86. Pipalia, N.H. ∙ Subramanian, K. ∙ Mao, S. ... Histone deacetylase inhibitors correct the cholesterol storage defect in most Niemann-Pick C1 mutant cells J. Lipid Res. 2017; 58 :695-708 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 5 min, washed with PBS and fixed with 2% PFA for 20 min. A stack of confocal images was acquired on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope using 40× oil immersion objective and a 561 nm laser. Sum projection images were generated, and total Alexa546 fluorescence intensity per cell area was quantified. As a control we treated the cells with 2.5-fold excess unlabeled LDL in presence of Alexa546-LDL to ensure that the Alexa546 signal was not non-specific.
Isogenic APOE astrocytes and microglia were grown in serum free media for 12 h on Matrigel coated 96 well plates. After pre-incubation for 12 h cells were treated with pHrodo-red dye (Thermo Fisher, P35364) conjugated myelin at different concentrations and live-imaged for 36 - 90 h using IncuCyte Live-Cell Analysis System. Myelin was purified from fresh autopsied control human brain using the gentleMACS Tissue Dissociator (Milteny Biotec), followed by myelin purification with myelin isolation beads (Milteny Biotec, 130-104-262) and confirmed >90% purity by FACS using an antibody for myelin basic protein (Milteny Biotec, REA1154). Purified myelin was conjugated with pHrodo-red dye following manufacturer’s guidelines. Using IncuCyte Live-Cell Analysis System, mean fluorescent intensity (MFI x μm 2 ) was measured and normalized to cell density measured by whole cell mask.
Dehydroergosterol (DHE) is a naturally-occurring sterol that closely mimics the behavior of cholesterol in cells and membranes ( Hao et al., 2002 31. Hao, M. ∙ Lin, S.X. ∙ Karylowski, O.J. ...

Isogenic APOE astrocytes were plated in 2% serum containing astrocyte medium. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with serum free medium and incubated for an additional 24 h. Subsequently, astrocytes were pulsed with dehydroergosterol (DHE, Sigma cat. No. E2634-5MG) complexed with methyl β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) ( Hao et al., 2002 31.

As control cells were treated with 0.5 mg/mL HDL containing astrocytes media without DHE-MβCD treatment (images not shown). To maintain the same cell density and imaging at the same time another set of dishes were treated with DHE-MβCD complex for 5 min and equilibrated for 2 h as a 0 h timepoint performed on the same day of imaging. Cells were washed with M2 buffer (150 mM Sodium Chloride (NaCl), 20 mM HEPES, 1.3 mM Calcium Chloride (CaCl 2 ), 5 mM Potassium Chloride, 1 mM Magnesium Chloride (MgCl 2 )) supplemented with 2 g/L glucose. Live cell images were acquired on widefield microscope from Leica GMBH at 40× magnification and equipped with special optics and DHE filter set ( Hao et al., 2002 31. Hao, M. ∙ Lin, S.X. ∙ Karylowski, O.J. ... Vesicular and non-vesicular sterol transport in living cells J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :609-617 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Images were recorded and analyzed to measure integrated DHE intensity retained in the cells. All data were normalized to APOE33 0 h time point within the experiment. Experiment was repeated 3 times.
Isogenic APOE astrocytes and microglia were seeded at 90% confluency on Matrigel-coated 96 well plates and maintained in growth media (2% serum for astrocytes, serum free for microglia). After 24 h, cells were washed with serum free media, loaded with fluorescently labeled cholesterol (Biovision, K582-100) that performs equivalently to radiolabeled cholesterol for 1 h and then equilibrated overnight in the incubator with light protection. Cells were treated with either cholesterol acceptors or methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) according to the manufacturers protocol using a cholesterol efflux fluorometric assay kit (Biovision, K582-100) and incubated an additional 4 - 6 h in the incubator with light protection. For LXR agonist treatments, cells were treated with 1x DMSO, 100nM GW3965 (Sigma-Aldrich, G6295), 8μM T0901317 (Sigma-Aldrich, T2320), 4 μM 25-hydroxycholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich, H1015) for 24 h with or without cholesterol acceptors. Further supernatants were transferred to flat-bottom 96 well plates, followed by fluorescent measurement at Ex/Em 485/523 nm. The adherent cells were solubilized by lysis buffer, and the lysates transferred to another 96 well plate where the fluorescence was again measured at the same wavelength. The fraction of total cholesterol was calculated by measuring RFU of supernatant normalized by the total RFU from cell lysate and supernatant.
Isogenic astrocytes (20,000 cells/cm 2 ) were plated in poly-D-lysine coated coverslip bottom dishes in serum free astrocyte medium. After 24 h incubation cells were labeled with 2 mg/mL TRITC labeled Dextran (ThermoFisher, D1818) and incubated for an additional 24 h to allow endocytosis and delivery to lysosomes ( Mukherjee et al., 1997 74. Mukherjee, S. ∙ Ghosh, R.N. ∙ Maxfield, F.R. Endocytosis Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77 :759-803 Crossref Scopus (1294) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, dextran (70 KDa) labeled astrocytes were chased with fresh astrocyte media for 2 h, washed with PBS, fixed with 2% PFA, and stained with 50 μg/mL filipin as described above. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 880, AxioObserver confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x oil DIC M27 objective and UV 405 and 561 lasers. Z-stacks were acquired using a step size equivalent to one airy unit.
The sum projected image from the stack of images were generated first and corrected for the background noise. The low threshold was applied to filipin signal in the images which represents total cellular cholesterol. The integrated intensity in low thresholded region was recorded. Next the threshold was applied to dextran positive puncta, mask was generated and transferred to filipin image. The intensity in the region under the mask was recorded representing co-localized region. The ratio of intensity under the dextran positive region and total low threshold region gives percent co-localization.
Fixed human postmortem tissue was sectioned on a vibratome (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) at 30 μm. Sequential sections were collected and stored in PBS with 0.02% sodium azide until used. Following standard immunofluorescence protocols, free-floating sections were incubated in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) heated at 80°C in a water bath for 30 min. Sections were then washed before blocking (TBS with 5% normal goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% TritonX-100) for 1hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies of 1:2,000 GFAP (Abcam, ab194325), 1:1,500 Iba-1 (FujiFilm (Wako), 019-19741), 1:2,000 NeuN (Abcam, ab190565), and 1:1,500 LAMP1 (Abcam, ab24170) were incubated at 4°C overnight under gentle motion. Sections were incubated in 37% formaldehyde at 37°C for 2 hours between incubation with primary antibodies of the same host. Secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit 555 (ThermoFisher, A21428) and goat anti-rabbit 647 (ThermoFisher, A21244) were diluted 1:1,000 and incubated for 1hr. When required, secondary antibody incubation was performed prior to incubation with formaldehyde. Filipin was prepared from powder form (Sigma Aldrich, F4767-5MG) and dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Following the last step of immunostaining, sections were washed with PBS and free cholesterol was labeled with filipin (125 μg/mL in PBS for 1 h at room temperature), followed by 3x wash with PBS. Tissue sections were mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount-G (ThermoFisher, 00-4958-02). Camera and microscope settings were adjusted at the start of the experiment and maintained for uniformity. Images were acquired within 24 h using a 40x objective and standard DAPI filter on a Keyence BZ-×800 microscope. Filipin images were taken within 24 h of staining to limit bleaching in fluorescence intensity per exposure. All tissue sections were processed within a single experiment to reduce variability.
Five image stacks of free cholesterol, microglia, astrocytes, and lysosomes were acquired from each post-mortem tissue sample and converted to 3D images with the surface-rendering feature of Imaris Bitplane software (version 9.7.2). In each image, a total number of 10 cells/image were analyzed. A surface render, or a mask over each channel corresponding to the different cell types, lysosomes, and filipin, was created, followed by a 3D render corresponding to the co-localization of all 3 channels. The intensity sum of this final mask was used for quantification and expressed as arbitrary units. All images were captured and analyzed by a blind observer using coded slides.
Protein lysates were collected at 4°C in RIPA buffer (Sigma) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10uM leupeptin, 5ug/ml pepstatin A, 3ug/ml aprotinin, 25ug/ml ALLN, and 0.5 mM PMSF). Conditioned growth medium was collected at 4°C with protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Cell Signaling) and concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 filters (30-kDa cut-off, EMD Millipore). Total protein concentration was determined by BCA method (ThermoFisher) and equal amounts of total protein were loaded onto 8% or 4-12% Bis-Tris Plus Gels (ThermoFisher). Following electrophoresis (100 V, 1 h), proteins were transferred to iBlot® 2 Transfer Stacks, nitrocellulose membranes (ThermoFisher Scientific). Blots were probed overnight at 4°C with 1:500 anti-HMG-CoA reductase (EMD Milipore, ABS229), 1:1,000 anti-APOE (Calbiochem, 178479), 1:200 anti-SREBP2 (Abcam, 30682), 1:1,000 anti-LAMP1 (Abcam, ab24170), or 1:700 anti-ABCA1 (Abcam, ab18180) followed by 1:2,000 HRP-conjugated secondary (Goat, life technologies, 611620; Rabbit, Vector Laboratories, PI-1000; Mouse, Vector Laboratories, PI-2000, 1 h at room temperature) and visualized with WesternBright™ ECL HRP Substrate reagents (Advansta) on the UVP System.
Isogenic APOE astrocytes incubated in serum free-conditioned media (20 h) were harvested with protease/phosphatase inhibitors, centrifuged (400 g, 4 min), and supernatant collected. There are no anti-inflammatory factors in the culture medium. Cell number was determined in order to load equal total protein. Samples were loaded in 96 well plates with standard controls containing cytokine/chemokine/growth factor 45-Plex Human Panel 1 (Invitrogen, ProcartaPlex) following manufacturer guidelines. Each well was loaded and quantified for each protein using the Luminex system (MAGPIX xPONENT4.2) ( Cook et al., 2019 17. Cook, D.B. ∙ McLucas, B.C. ∙ Montoya, L.A. ... Multiplexing protein and gene level measurements on a single Luminex platform Methods. 2019; 158 :27-32 Crossref Google Scholar ). Hierarchical clustering and correlation coefficient analyses of differentially secreted proteins were performed using R.
Genetic variant screening was performed on a global screening array (GSA) chip (Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array) using harvested genomic DNA (Qiagen, DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit). To ensure high quality genotype data, samples passed the quality control (QC) metrics (SNP call rate > 95%, minor allele frequency (MAF) > 5%, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) p-value > 1E-6, sample call rate > 95%) were analyzed. Sample ancestry was confirmed by multidimensional scaling (MDS) using PLINK 1.9 ( Chang et al., 2015 13. Chang, C.C. ∙ Chow, C.C. ∙ Tellier, L.C. ... Second-generation PLINK: rising to the challenge of larger and richer datasets GigaScience. 2015; 4 :7 Crossref Scopus (4115) PubMed Google Scholar ); MDS values for each subject were compared to 1000 Genome Project (Phase 3) sample values ( Genomes Project et al., 2015 25. Genomes Project, C. ∙ Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ... A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (7959) PubMed Google Scholar ). Related samples were determined based on pair-wise identity-by-descent (IBD) estimation using PLINK. Duplicated samples with PI-HAT values between 0.99 to 1 were identified (see Table S1 and S4 ).
Genetic risk scores (GRS) were obtained for the study line selection from GSA and Taqman genotype-based imputation results from subjects without APOE genotype. AD GWAS IGAP reference SNPs with their associated β ( Lambert et al., 2013 49. Lambert, J.C. ∙ Ibrahim-Verbaas, C.A. ∙ Harold, D. ... Meta-analysis of 74, 046 individuals identifies 11 new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 :1452-1458 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) were computed using PLINK and the following formula: 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑆 = 𝛴 𝑗 ⁢ ( 𝑆 𝑗 × 𝐺 𝑗 ) / 𝑀 , where M is number of markers, S is β, and G is subject genotype.
We controlled the number of M = 28 from AD GWAS. The scored subjects are independent from the AD GWAS study used to generate the original weighted score.
For the haplotype analysis, the APOE region around the APOE gene that was broad enough to cover haplotypic backgrounds of each individual ( APOE ±50 kbp) was defined. After selecting the APOE region, GSA samples of each line with the 1000 Genomes unrelated Europeans without EUR-FIN (Finnish) N = 399 in 1000 Genome Project (Phase 3) ( Genomes Project et al., 2015 25. Genomes Project, C. ∙ Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ... A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (7959) PubMed Google Scholar ) were merged. Variant QC was included SNP call rate = 100%, MAF > 10%, HWE p value > 1E-6. Fifteen SNPs that were passed the QC were used in the haplotype analysis including rs3852856, rs519825, rs4803766, rs6859, rs157580, rs59007384, rs8106922, rs1160985, rs405509, rs439401, rs56131196, rs4420638, rs1132899, rs5167, and rs11083752. Haplotype phasing was performed using the MaCH program ( Li et al., 2010 54. Li, Y. ∙ Willer, C.J. ∙ Ding, J. ... MaCH: using sequence and genotype data to estimate haplotypes and unobserved genotypes Genet. Epidemiol. 2010; 34 :816-834 Crossref Scopus (1477) PubMed Google Scholar ). Haplotype names are based on the 1000 Genomes haplotypes (total 798 haplotypes after haplotype phasing) ( Table S9 ). We defined common (frequencies > 10, hap.01-23, hap.01 being the most frequent to hap.23 being the least frequent) and rare (frequencies < 10, hap.other) haplotypes. Haplotype sequences that did not match with any of the 1000G haplotypes were grouped together and named as NA.
Cells were harvested, stored in RNAlater, and RNA subsequently extracted from all cell types using RNeasy Mini (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s guidelines. Deep RNA sequencing (50 - 70 million reads per sample) was performed by UCI Genomics High-Throughput Facility for hiPSC-brain cells and by Genewiz for mouse primary glia. The Illumina TruSeq mRNA stranded protocol was used to isolate poly-A mRNA from RNA (RNA integrity score ≥9) and 200 ng was used to construct libraries that were quantified and normalized using the Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced as paired-end 100 bp reads on the Illumina HiSeq 4000. Paired-end sequencing reads were aligned to the hg38 genome using Star aligner ( Dobin et al., 2013 19. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (17570) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aligned and sorted bam files were loaded into IGV to verify APOE genotype ( Robinson et al., 2011 93. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Winckler, W. ... Integrative genomics viewer Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :24-26 Crossref Scopus (7238) PubMed Google Scholar ). FeatureCounts ( Liao et al., 2014 55. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (7989) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to quantify gene expression based on GENCODE. Gene level read counts were normalized as Counts per Million mapped reads using trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization to adjust for sequencing library variance. The ERCC spike-in control ( Jiang et al., 2011 37. Jiang, L. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ∙ Davis, C.A. ... Synthetic spike-in standards for RNA-seq experiments Genome Res. 2011; 21 :1543-1551 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to adjust for sequencing batch effect. Sex effects were corrected by linear regression. Multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis was performed using R. Next, DEGs between different APOE genotypes within the same cell types were identified by linear model analysis using the Bioconductor package DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 62. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (29293) PubMed Google Scholar ). For multiple test adjustment, the false discovery rate (FDR) of the differential expression test was estimated using the Benjamini–Hochberg method ( Reiner et al., 2003 91. Reiner, A. ∙ Yekutieli, D. ∙ Benjamini, Y. Identifying differentially expressed genes using false discovery rate controlling procedures Bioinformatics. 2003; 19 :368-375 Crossref Scopus (1056) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test if known gene ontology (GO) and pathways are enriched for DEGs, fast preranked gene set enrichment analysis (fGSEA) was performed using GO annotations and canonical pathways (Biocarta, KEGG and Reactome) available from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) with FDR < 0.1 as a significance threshold ( Subramanian et al., 2005 105. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (25008) PubMed Google Scholar ), following 1 million gene set permutations. For mouse data, homology conversion of mouse to human DEGs are carried out, followed by fGSEA. The functional and causal network analyses were further performed by integrating DEGs of significantly enriched pathways into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) ( Kramer et al., 2014 45. Krämer, A. ∙ Green, J. ∙ Pollard, Jr., J. ... Causal analysis approaches in Ingenuity pathway analysis Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :523-530 Crossref Scopus (2579) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significantly enriched pathways and disease/functional annotations were identified ( Table S2 ).
DEG analysis on postmortem brain was stratified by region and disease severity: prefrontal cortex (PFC, BA10), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22), parahippocampal gyrus (PHG, BA36), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, BA44) ( Wang et al., 2018b 113. Wang, M. ∙ Beckmann, N.D. ∙ Roussos, P. ... The Mount Sinai cohort of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data in Alzheimer's disease Sci. Data. 2018; 5 :180185 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CDR (0-5), clinical phenotype (Cerebral AD, possible AD, probable AD, and definite AD), and neuropathological plaque severity (normal, mild, medium, and severe) and further plotted with significant pathways of FDR < 0.05. For deconvolution analysis, digital sorting algorithm (DSA) ( Zhong et al., 2013 124. Zhong, Y. ∙ Wan, Y.W. ∙ Pang, K. ... Digital sorting of complex tissues for cell type-specific gene expression profiles BMC Bioinf. 2013; 14 :89 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), population-specific expression analysis (PSEA) ( Kuhn et al., 2011 47. Kuhn, A. ∙ Thu, D. ∙ Waldvogel, H.J. ... Population-specific expression analysis (PSEA) reveals molecular changes in diseased brain Nat. Methods. 2011; 8 :945-947 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and non-negative matrix factorization (ssKL) ( Brunet et al., 2004 11. Brunet, J.P. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Golub, T.R. ... Metagenes and molecular pattern discovery using matrix factorization Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101 :4164-4169 Crossref Scopus (1253) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a PCA-based method modified from CellCODE (BRETIGEA, BRain cEll Type specIfic Gene Expression Analysis) ( McKenzie et al., 2018 67. McKenzie, A.T. ∙ Wang, M. ∙ Hauberg, M.E. ... Brain cell type specific gene expression and Co-expression network architectures Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :8868 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ) were tested on available RNAseq data from human primary brain cells ( Zhang et al., 2016 121. Zhang, Y. ∙ Sloan, S.A. ∙ Clarke, L.E. ... Purification and characterization of progenitor and mature human astrocytes reveals transcriptional and functional differences with mouse Neuron. 2016; 89 :37-53 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1047) PubMed Google Scholar ), hiPSC-derived cells ( TCW et al., 2017 109. TCW, J. ∙ Wang, M. ∙ Pimenova, A.A. ... An efficient platform for astrocyte differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells Stem Cell Rep. 2017; 9 :600-614 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our dataset. Given the relatively clear cell-type composition of the public data, they served as a reference to determine the best method and parameters. Each method required known brain cell-type-specific markers to either infer the cell-type composition or compute the composition-informative surrogate variables. While other cell-type proportions were similarly determined between DSA and PSEA, PSEA did not properly estimate the neuron proportion (< 10%) in whole brains. Further, ssKL failed to properly assign microglia and endothelial cells. Although PCA-based BRETIGIA appropriately measured cell type proportions, thus we used it as a reference, the vector value of the algorithm could not be applied to deconvolute gene expression. Based on the consistent results achieved using both BRETIGIA and DSA, we therefore chose DSA for deconvolution following cell-type proportion determination. We used a consensus top ranked cell-type-specific marker set from a recent meta-analysis of multiple cell type-specific and single cell RNAseq datasets ( McKenzie et al., 2018 67. McKenzie, A.T. ∙ Wang, M. ∙ Hauberg, M.E. ... Brain cell type specific gene expression and Co-expression network architectures Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :8868 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Performance was evaluated using a series of marker numbers (1, 3, 5, 10, up to 50). DSA (marker size 5) performed best and therefore was used in all subsequent deconvolution analyses. We used brain RNAseq data from the Mount Sinai brain bank (MSBB) AD ( Wang et al., 2016 114. Wang, M. ∙ Roussos, P. ∙ McKenzie, A. ... Integrative network analysis of nineteen brain regions identifies molecular signatures and networks underlying selective regional vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease Genome Med. 2016; 8 :104 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and religious orders study-memory and aging project (ROSMAP) ( De Jager et al., 2018 18. De Jager, P.L. ∙ Ma, Y. ∙ McCabe, C. ... A multi-omic atlas of the human frontal cortex for aging and Alzheimer's disease research Sci. Data. 2018; 5 :180142 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) cohorts ( Table S6 ). Before cell-type proportion inference, we corrected for: postmortem interval (PMI), age of death (AOD), RIN, exonic rate, race, rRNA rate, sex and batch. We deconvoluted the data for each brain region separately using csSAM ( Shen-Orr et al., 2010 100. Shen-Orr, S.S. ∙ Tibshirani, R. ∙ Khatri, P. ... Cell type-specific gene expression differences in complex tissues Nat. Methods. 2010; 7 :287-289 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequently performed DEG analysis between APOE4 and APOE3 in each cell type stratified by disease status measured by CDR (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). GO and pathways enriched for DEGs were computed by fGSEA. Significantly enriched pathways were further investigated by IPA ( Kramer et al., 2014 45. Krämer, A. ∙ Green, J. ∙ Pollard, Jr., J. ... Causal analysis approaches in Ingenuity pathway analysis Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :523-530 Crossref Scopus (2579) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significantly enriched pathways and disease/functional annotations were identified ( Table S3 ).
Downloaded raw RNAseq data of multiple brain cell types from gene expression omnibus (accession GSE73721 ) ( Zhang et al., 2016 121. Zhang, Y. ∙ Sloan, S.A. ∙ Clarke, L.E. ... Purification and characterization of progenitor and mature human astrocytes reveals transcriptional and functional differences with mouse Neuron. 2016; 89 :37-53 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1047) PubMed Google Scholar ) was processed using the same Star-FeatureCounts pipeline described above. The gene level read counts were merged with the data generated in this project, normalized using the TMM approach, and sex and batch corrected using linear regression. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using R.
Sequenced transcripts from three human cell-types, microglia, astrocytes, and mixed cortical cultures from both population samples and isogenic samples, were prepared separately for network analysis with WGCNA v1.68. A total of 15,252 transcripts were filtered as follows: transcripts with a row sum less than 1 CPM for at least 90% of the libraries were removed from the data set. CPM expression values were transformed using log2(x + 1), and the 75% most variant genes were selected for network analysis. The sva v3.34.0 “ComBat” function was used to adjust for the following covariates: sex, RIN, batch, cell type proportion for mixed cortical cultures, and GRSnoAPOE (GRS-APOE locus) for population samples, and individual for isogenic samples.
For each cell-line, a topological overlay map (TOM) was constructed from all samples combined using the “blockwiseModules” function. Pair-wise correlation values between genes were calculated using the biweight midcorrelation function, and correlation values were weighted by a soft-threshold power unique to each network. To pull significantly enriched module, a correlation dendrogram was built by average linkage hierarchical clustering, and densely interconnected genes were clustered into modules using average sensitivity, a minimum meta FDR-corrected q-value of 1E-8, and a merge cut-off unique to each network.
For each module in the networks, the module eigengene (ME) was calculated, which represented the expression profile of the module. A Student’s t-test was applied to detect ME differential expression between genotypes ( APOE4 vs. APOE3 ) amongst the population and isogenic samples. Only modules with p < 0.1 were considered to be differentially expressed. A Fisher’s exact test was performed for the differentially expressed modules to detect significant pathway enrichment (p < 0.1) using the seq2pathway v1.18.0 R-package and the curated canonical pathways with gene symbols using MSigDB. Modules were related to APOE genotype as follows: APOE3 samples were assigned a 0 while APOE4 samples were assigned a 1. Spearman correlation values were then calculated between samples and module eigengenes. Modules with positive values (red) indicated positive correlation of MEs with APOE4 genotype, while modules with negative values (blue) indicated negative correlation of MEs with these traits.
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 (GraphPad Software). One-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s Multiple comparison post hoc test or unpaired one-tailed Student’s t tests were used. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. The number N (population size) or n (sample size), and statistical tests were reported in each figure legend.
