Title: Topical therapy for regression and melanoma prevention of congenital giant nevi


Abstract: Summary

Giant congenital melanocytic nevi are NRAS -driven proliferations that may cover up to 80% of the body surface. Their most dangerous consequence is progression to melanoma. This risk often triggers preemptive extensive surgical excisions in childhood, producing severe lifelong challenges. We have presented preclinical models, including multiple genetically engineered mice and xenografted human lesions, which enabled testing locally applied pharmacologic agents to avoid surgery. The murine models permitted the identification of proliferative versus senescent nevus phases and treatments targeting both. These nevi recapitulated the histologic and molecular features of human giant congenital nevi, including the risk of melanoma transformation. Cutaneously delivered MEK, PI3K, and c-KIT inhibitors or proinflammatory squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE) achieved major regressions. SADBE triggered innate immunity that ablated detectable nevocytes, fully prevented melanoma, and regressed human giant nevus xenografts. These findings reveal nevus mechanistic vulnerabilities and suggest opportunities for topical interventions that may alter the therapeutic options for children with congenital giant nevi.

Section: Introduction

Congenital melanocytic nevi are benign proliferations of nevomelanocytes that are present at birth. Large or giant congenital nevi occur in approximately 1 in 20,000 births ( Chien et al., 2010 10.

Congenital giant melanocytic nevi Rare Tumors. 2009; 1 :e9 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The estimated rates of conversion from benign nevus to malignant melanoma are approximately 2% and 12% in patients with large and giant congenital nevi, respectively ( Bett, 2005 5. Bett, B.J.

Other side effects of congenital melanocytic nevi include weakened skin integrity within the lesions as well as major cosmetic and psychosocial ramifications due to their appearance ( Koot et al., 2000 35.

The current available treatments for patients with congenital melanocytic nevi include surgical excision, dermatome shaving, pigment-specific laser, and others ( Ibrahimi et al., 2012 28.

The development of alternative therapies that avoid the shortcomings of the current treatments (such as extensive scarring) while minimizing the lifetime risk of melanoma is needed.
Activating NRAS mutations are the sole recurrent somatic mutation found in up to 80%–95% of large and giant congenital nevi ( Bauer et al., 2007 4. Bauer, J. ∙ Curtin, J.A. ∙ Pinkel, D. ... Congenital melanocytic nevi frequently harbor NRAS mutations but no BRAF mutations J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127 :179-182 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). The majority of NRAS mutations are Q61K or Q61R amino acid substitutions, resulting in a constitutively active NRAS protein ( Bauer et al., 2007 4. Bauer, J. ∙ Curtin, J.A. ∙ Pinkel, D. ...

In this study, we describe the development and characterization of murine congenital nevus models that accurately recapitulate key features of human giant congenital nevi, including risk of progression to invasive melanoma. We utilized these preclinical models to test a collection of localized drug treatments and observed that MEK (mitogen-activated kinase)-targeted local therapies exhibit regressive activity. We additionally observed a profound clearance of the lesions following topical squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE)-based immunotherapy, an approach that also offered 100% protection against melanoma formation within treated skin of prospectively followed mice. The activity of SADBE was shown to be mediated by macrophages. Therefore, it was possible to confirm SADBE efficacy in xenografts of human resected giant nevi established in immunodeficient (SHO) mice that retain macrophage function. These data suggest that an immune-based approach that utilizes topical SADBE may hold therapeutic potential for human giant congenital nevi.

Section: Results

We generated and then characterized both constitutive and inducible murine giant congenital nevus models and compared their features with those of corresponding human lesions. Melanocyte-specific Nras Q61R mutant mice were generated by crossing lox-stop-lox (LSL)- Nras Q61R knockin mice ( Burd et al., 2014 7. Burd, C.E. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Huynh, M.V. ... Mutation-specific RAS oncogenicity explains NRAS codon 61 selection in melanoma Cancer Discov. 2014; 4 :1418-1429 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ) with transgenic mice expressing homozygous Cre recombinase under the control of melanocyte-specific promoters, including dopachrome tautomerase ( Dct ) and tyrosinase ( Tyr ). Newborn mice harboring the Dct -Cre-mediated Nras Q61R mutation displayed cutaneous hyperpigmentation and retained their congenital pigmented lesions throughout life, without spontaneous regression ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). Abundant ectopic dermal melanin was detected in mutant skin ( Figures 1 B and S1 B), and the melanin producing dermal melanocytes stained positively for the Nras Q61R mutation ( Figure S1 C). Melanocytic markers, such as S100, SOX10, MITF (microphthalmia associated transcription factor), and phospho-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), were also present within dermal nevus cells ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 D–S1F). When lesions from Nras mutant mice were juxtaposed with human giant congenital nevi (e.g., Figures 1 G and S2 ), multiple comparable histologic features were detected. Similar to the human giant congenital nevi, the mutant mouse nevi were adjacent to adnexal structures while sparing other structures, distributed within papillary and reticular dermis extending into superficial subcutaneous fat, and combined with variably pigmented spindle-shaped nevus cells. In addition, superficial aggregates of nevus cells formed nests and penetrated along collagen bundles parallel to the long axis of the epidermis.
In order to assess proliferative vs senescent phases of nevus development, melanocyte-specific expression of inducible Nras Q61R mutation was activated by topical 4-hydroxytamoxifen (tamoxifen) treatment in neonatal offspring of LSL- Nras Q61R knockin mice crossed with tamoxifen-inducible Tyr -CreER T2 mice. 2 weeks after induction, skin hyperpigmentation was observed, driven by ectopic dermal melanocytes that developed in tamoxifen-treated areas of skin ( Figures 1 E, 1F, S1 G, and S1H). We also generated mice by using constitutive Tyr -Cre-mediated Nras Q61R expression. The combination of these alleles was lethal in most offspring. In addition to skin hyperpigmentation, the few surviving Tyr -Cre Nras Q61R mutants displayed hydrocephalus ( Figure S1 I) and other neurologic abnormalities, such as neurocutaneous melanosis, ( Figures S1 J–S1N) which are in line with similar murine and human Nras mutations expressed in mice and in children ( Kinsler et al., 2013 34.

Since the therapeutic efficacies of various treatments may depend on whether nevus cells are proliferating or arrested/senescent, we quantified the proportion of dermal melanocytic cells in Dct -Cre Nras Q61R mice, at various time points relative to date of birth, measuring proliferative and senescence markers. The results indicated that neonatal nevus cells are negative for p16 Ink4a ( Figure 2 A) and positive for Ki67 ( Figure 2 B), consistent with a proliferative phase. In contrast, adult nevus cells are positive for p16 Ink4a ( Figure 2 C), but not Ki67 ( Figure 2 D), consistent with growth arrest and senescence ( Gray-Schopfer et al., 2006 20. Gray-Schopfer, V.C. ∙ Cheong, S.C. ∙ Chong, H. ... Cellular senescence in naevi and immortalisation in melanoma: a role for p16? Br. J.

Absence of distinguishing senescence traits in human melanocytic nevi J. Invest. Dermatol. 2012; 132 :2226-2234 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quantification of these data revealed that Nras Q61R mutation-driven congenital nevi are initially proliferative and become senescent over approximately 3 weeks ( Figure 2 E, note left and right y axes), a feature that has also been observed in humans ( Gerami and Paller, 2013 19.

Human giant congenital nevi carry a significant risk of melanomagenesis ( Bajaj et al., 2009 2. Bajaj, M.S. ∙ Khuraijam, N. ∙ Sen, S. ... Congenital melanocytoma manifesting as proptosis with multiple cutaneous melanocytic nevi and oculodermal melanosis Arch. Ophthalmol. 2009; 127 :937-939 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ; Krengel et al., 2006 37. Krengel, S. ∙ Hauschild, A. ∙ Schäfer, T. Melanoma risk in congenital melanocytic naevi: a systematic review Br. J. Dermatol. 2006; 155 :1-8 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shah, 2010 59. Shah, K.N. The risk of melanoma and neurocutaneous melanosis associated with congenital melanocytic nevi Semin. Cutan. Med. Surg. 2010; 29 :159-164 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). We, therefore, assessed the risk of melanoma development in our Nras Q61R mutation-driven murine nevus models. Tumor-free survival curves for Nras mutant animals displayed significant rates of melanoma formation in Dct -Cre Nras Q61R mice ( Figure 3 A) and Tyr -CreER T2 Nras Q61R mice ( Figure 3 B) compared with control mice. In humans, melanomas derived from giant congenital nevi are typically heterozygous for mutant NRAS ( Kinsler et al., 2013 34. Kinsler, V.A. ∙ Thomas, A.C. ∙ Ishida, M. ... Multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and neurocutaneous melanosis are caused by postzygotic mutations in codon 61 of NRAS J. Invest. Dermatol. 2013; 133 :2229-2236 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ; Price, 2016 49. Price, H.N. Congenital melanocytic nevi: update in genetics and management Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2016; 28 :476-482 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this, we observed significant latency and sporadic frequency of spontaneous melanoma formation in Nras Q61R/+ heterozygous mice activated by either constitutive ( Dct -Cre) or inducible ( Tyr -CreER T2 ) Cre alleles ( Figures 3 A and 3B, red lines), thus resembling another feature of human giant congenital nevi. Two copies of Nras Q61R produced melanoma transformation with a shorter latency and a higher penetrance in both the constitutive ( Dct -Cre) and inducible ( Tyr-CreER T2 ) backgrounds ( Figures 3 A and 3B, green lines). Furthermore, we found that Dct -Cre Nras Q61R mutation-driven melanomas were positive for melanocytic markers, including S100, SOX10 ( Figure 3 C), and MITF ( Figure 3 H), and were highly proliferative ( Figure 3 D). The activating Nras Q61R epitope was found in both models ( Figures 3 E and 3I), and 3 of 3 melanomas arising on heterozygous Nras Q61R mice retained the wild-type Nras allele ( Figure S3 ). The activation of MEK/ERK signaling in Dct -Cre Nras Q61R nevus-derived melanomas was confirmed by immunofluorescence ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Dct -Cre Nras Q61R mutation-driven murine melanomas ( Figures 3 L–3N) also showed similar histologic features when compared with those of human melanomas ( Figures 3 J and 3K).
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on nevi containing pinna and tumors from Dct -Cre Nras Q61R/+ and Tyr -CreER T2 Nras Q61R/Q61R mice and compared with normal pinna. Pigmentation/melanocytic genes were somewhat upregulated with larger upregulation in homozygous Nras Q61R/Q61R nevi ( Figure S4 A), likely reflecting the relative mixture of nevus cells within other skin cells. Previously published human CMN (congenital melanocytic naevus) expression data ( Martins da Silva et al., 2019 40. Martins da Silva, V. ∙ Martinez-Barrios, E. ∙ Tell-Martí, G. ... Genetic abnormalities in large to giant congenital nevi: Beyond NRAS mutations J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :900-908 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed heterogeneous expression patterns with some showing only weak melanocytic genes (e.g., MITF, SOX10), whereas others showing higher melanocytic genes expression ( Figure S4 B). In addition, there is evidence of upregulated interferon-α response as well as G2M checkpoint in the mouse CMN models compared with normal skin ( Figure S4 C). Upregulated transcription factors, such as hematopoietic factor Gfi1b (fold change = 33.3, q value < 3.7 × 10 −2 ), regulatory T cell-specific factor Foxp3 (fold change = 3.7, q value < × 1.5 10 −2 ), and lymphoid specific transcription factor Spi-b (fold change = 3.0, q value < 4.5 × 10 −2 ) also indicate immune infiltration in heterozygous nevi. Gfi and Foxp3 are included among the top 20 LISA (epigenetic Landscape in silico Sequence Analysis)-predicted TF (transcription factor) regulators of the differentially expressed genes, along with other immune-related factors, Stat1, Stat3, Runx1, Irf4, RelA, and Tbx21 ( Figure S4 D). In tumors, both models exhibited heterogeneity in expression patterns, likely reflecting variable second genetic events that followed the initiating Nras Q61R genomic event. Ngfr and Sox10 were upregulated in Dct -Cre Nras Q61R/+ tumors ( Figure S4 E). Interestingly, Sox9 was downregulated in tumors from both models, similar to SOX9 in human melanoma ( Yang et al., 2019 73. Yang, X. ∙ Liang, R. ∙ Liu, C. ... SOX9 is a dose-dependent metastatic fate determinant in melanoma J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2019; 38 :17 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). The interferon-α response was upregulated in the mouse tumors ( Figure S4 F). Human CMN samples ( Martins da Silva et al., 2019 40. Martins da Silva, V. ∙ Martinez-Barrios, E. ∙ Tell-Martí, G. ... Genetic abnormalities in large to giant congenital nevi: Beyond NRAS mutations J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :900-908 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) expressed a number of pathways in common with the murine CMNs, including upregulated interferon-α and downregulated oxidative phosphorylation and adipogenesis ( Figure S4 G). We therefore utilized these murine models of Nras Q61R mutation-driven melanocytic nevi in subsequent experiments to preclinically evaluate therapeutic strategies to regress nevi and prevent progression to melanoma.
We hypothesized that MAPK or PI3K pathway inhibitors (either alone or in combination) may lead to regression of Nras Q61R mutation-driven giant congenital nevi, as evidence supporting this for MEK inhibitors has been previously reported ( Kinsler et al., 2017 33.

Local inhibition of MEK/Akt prevents cellular growth in human congenital melanocytic nevi J. Invest. Dermatol. 2019; 139 :2004-2015.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested MEK and/or PI3K inhibitors applied as direct intralesional injection into paws (skin is thicker) or topical application to ears ( Table S1 ). Local administration of these agents to 2-month-old tamoxifen-induced Tyr -CreER T2 Nras Q61R mice led to a significant loss of nevus cells and hypopigmentation ( Figures 4 and S5 ). In topical single-drug therapies, the MEK inhibitor, binimetinib, induced clear hypopigmentation ( Figure S5 B), and the PI3K inhibitor, omipalisib, caused moderate hypopigmentation in the dermis ( Figure S5 C). Subcutaneous injection of the MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib ( Figures 4 A and 4B) and binimetinib ( Figures S5 A and S5B), or of the PI3K inhibitor, omipalisib ( Figures 4 D, 4E, and S5 C), resulted in hypopigmentation and almost complete loss of melanocytes ( Figures 4 C and 4F), compared with untreated control ( Figure 4 G). These data suggest that localized treatment of postsenescent nevi with inhibitors targeting kinases downstream of RAS may cause the selective loss of nevus cells, albeit not necessarily complete ablation. Drukker et al. showed activated AKT pathway activity in giant nevi ( Drukker et al., 2013 15. Drukker, L. ∙ Margulis, A. ∙ Chaouat, M. ... Changes of PI3K/AKT/BCL2 signaling proteins in congenital Giant Nevi: melanocytes contribute to their increased survival and integrity J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2013; 33 :359-366 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore tested various kinase-targeting combinations. When applied to right ear skin and compared with contralateral ears treated with vehicle control, we observed that topical combinations of trametinib and omipalisib ( Figures 4 G, 4I, and 4K) or binimetinib and omipalisib ( Figures 4 H, 4J, and 4L) led to strong melanocyte regression and dramatic depigmentation, demonstrating that the effects were localized and not systemic. MEK- or PI3K-targeted local therapies alone or in combination may thus regress Nras Q61R -driven nevi. The c-KIT inhibitor, imatinib, has inhibitory effects on human melanocytes and infrequently causes skin hypopigmentation ( Cerchione et al., 2009 8. Cerchione, C. ∙ Fabbricini, R. ∙ Pane, F. ...

Proc. 2001; 6 :1-5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that single-drug treatment with imatinib resulted in measurable depigmentation ( Figure S5 K). Moreover, a topical combination of binimetinib with imatinib led to more profound melanocyte regressions ( Figures S5 F and S5G) and depigmentation ( Figures S5 D and S5E). This combination induced immune responses ( Figures S5 H–S5J), as evident by the increased inflammatory cell recruitment (CD11c+, CD163+, and CD16+) to treated lesions.
We chose to test the efficacy of haptens, as these are low molecular weight chemicals that become antigenic when bound to a carrier molecule and consequently elicit a well-known “contact hypersensitivity”-like response ( Chipinda et al., 2011 11. Chipinda, I. ∙ Hettick, J.M. ∙ Siegel, P.D. Haptenation: chemical reactivity and protein binding J. Allergy (Cairo). 2011; 2011 :839682 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Vocanson et al., 2009 68. Vocanson, M. ∙ Hennino, A. ∙ Rozières, A. ... Effector and regulatory mechanisms in allergic contact dermatitis Allergy. 2009; 64 :1699-1714 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether topical hapten-based immunotherapy is capable of regressing congenital nevi, we tested SADBE, as a single-agent topical immunotherapy. SADBE was chosen for this study because it is already clinically used by dermatologists as a topical agent for alopecia areata and warts and because it has been described to induce hypopigmentation or vitiligo ( Sakai et al., 2020 55.

Venereol. 1989; 124 :31-32 PubMed Google Scholar ). 2 months after tamoxifen induction of nevi in ear skin of Tyr -CreER T2 Nras Q61R neonatal mice, the Nras Q61R mutation-driven nevus mice were sensitized by applying 2% SADBE to the right side of the shaved abdomen. Subsequent treatment of the right ear with topical 1.5% SADBE occurred three times over the following week. This short-term single-agent therapy resulted in major regression of congenital nevi ( Figure 5 A). We next tested the efficacy of SADBE single agent on both senescent and proliferative giant congenital nevi in dorsal skin of Dct -Cre Nras Q61R -mutant mice as depicted in Figures 5 B and 5G, respectively. When senescent nevus lesions were treated with SADBE beginning at 2 months of age, we observed skin depigmentation in areas treated with SADBE ( Figures 5 C and 5F). This regression was confirmed by the disappearance of both melanocytes and melanin ( Figures 5 D and 5E). To study susceptibility of proliferative nevi, SADBE treatments were initiated within a week of birth as depicted in Figure 5 G, prior to the loss of proliferative nevus features ( Figure 2 E). Nevus regression was again noted ( Figure 5 H, lower panel red arrow) as well as subsequent leukotrichia (white hair) in SADBE-treated areas ( Figure 5 H, upper panel red arrow). In contrast, melanocytic nevi remained in areas treated with vehicle control ( Figure 5 H, purple arrows). Disappearance of both melanocytes and melanin was verified in treated lesions ( Figures 5 I and 5J).
In order to assess immune cell requirements for the SADBE-dependent regression of nevi, depletion of specific immune populations was performed on 2-month-old Dct -Cre Nras Q61R mice through IP injection of monoclonal antibodies directed at distinct immune lineages. Skin Melan-A-positive nevus cells were quantified after SADBE treatment and compared with vehicle control ( Figure 6 A). Depletion of macrophages via anti-F4/80 significantly inhibited the ability of SADBE to clear melan-A-positive cells; however, depletion of CD4+ T cells, NK1.1+ NK cells CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells did not diminish the regression efficacy of SADBE. Depletion of tissue-resident cells (such as macrophages) is typically incomplete compared with other hematopoietic lineages, but the diminished efficacy of SADBE despite incomplete depletion ( Figure 6 B) strongly suggests that these cells play a key functional role in nevus clearance. Cells expressing the proinflammatory macrophage (M1) marker iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) were also strongly recruited by SADBE ( Figure 6 B), as were anti-inflammatory Arg1+ cells ( Figure 6 C). Furthermore, CD4+ T cell depletion enhanced macrophage recruitment, with modestly larger increases in proinflammatory (and decreased anti-inflammatory Arg1+) populations and slightly higher melanin clearance ( Figure 6 C). Thus, SADBE appears to attract both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages. To independently assess the effect of SADBE on the presence of markers for these cell populations, Dct -Cre Nras Q61R mice were treated with either SADBE or vehicle control (3 per treatment or control groups) for 72 h, and RNA-seq was carried out. Differential gene expression analysis revealed macrophage-related cytokines among top upregulated genes ( Figure 6 D). GSEA analysis showed TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α) signaling via NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) as the top upregulated pathway ( Figure 6 E). SADBE was shown to highly induce genes of multiple macrophage subtypes, which included proinflammatory M1-like polarization genes ( Figure 6 F) and GO (gene ontology) biological processes analysis showed migration and regulation of phagocytosis as enriched pathways ( Figure 6 G).
These lineage-ablation and expression studies suggested that SADBE’s clearance of nevus cells was not dependent upon adaptive immune cell types but rather required macrophage function. We therefore engrafted human discarded resected CMN tissue onto immunodeficient SHO mice (which lack adaptive immunity but retain at least partial macrophage function) ( Bancroft and Kelly, 1994 3. Bancroft, G.J. ∙ Kelly, J.P. Macrophage activation and innate resistance to infection in SCID mice Immunobiology. 1994; 191 :424-431 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Charles River) in order to test responses to SADBE. Eight human CMN xenografts were thus generated from a single giant nevus specimen. We utilized the epidermal region of the lesion that contained a significant epidermal nevus component for engraftment, thereby enhancing vascular supply and immune access. Following a 4-month recovery period, the grafts were subjected to biweekly topical treatment with 1% SADBE (or vehicle control) with dosing guided by potential sensitivity of the graft, followed by harvesting and staining for nevus cells using the melanocytic antibody anti-TRP2 (TRP, transient receptor potential). SADBE treatments in these xenografted mice led to thickening of the stratum corneum (superficial dead cell layer of xenografts, Figure S6 A), which contained significantly accumulated pigment, thus obscuring underlying cellular pigmentation changes. Stratum corneum thickening was not observed in mouse models (above) or in humans who were treated with SADBE for warts or alopecia areata. Immunofluorescence staining and automated quantification of underlying nevus cells (TRP2+) revealed a striking melanocyte decrease of ∼90% (p = 0.03) in human giant nevus xenografts following SADBE treatment as compared with vehicle controls ( Figures 7 A and 7B). To further examine whether SADBE treatments of human-to-mouse xenografts were inducing macrophage recruitment (as in the murine model), specimens from 2 weeks following initiation of topical SADBE treatment were stained with the macrophage marker F4/80. Figures 7 C and 7D depict the results of F4/80+ immunostaining and its quantification and reveal significant recruitment of mouse macrophages (F4/80+) into the CMN tissue (vehicle 0.21 ± 0.03, SADBE 1.01 ± 0.22, p = 0.004). These results corroborate nevus cell regressions within human tissue, showing that SADBE exhibits the ability to induce macrophage recruitment together with the significant clearance of human CMN cells within the murine SHO model.
To more stringently test whether SADBE could visually regress melanocytic nevus cells, regress pigmentation, and also prevent melanoma formation, we treated a cohort of 29 Dct- Cre Nras Q61R/+ mice with SADBE over dorsal trunk skin and observed their long-term melanoma incidence for up to 400 days. As shown in Figure 7 E, pretreatment with SADBE fully protected against melanoma formation within the treated skin (dorsal half of the trunk) during the observation period. Importantly, six melanomas did form in the SADBE-treated mice; however, all of these tumors were in untreated areas of the skin, where depigmentation was also not observed ( Figure 7 E, blue arrow), further confirming the localized activity of the regressive treatment. Finally, to determine whether lower doses of SADBE may be capable of minimizing toxicity while maintaining efficacy at regressing CMN cells in the Dct-Nras Q61R model, we tested the lower dose 0.5% SADBE 3 times per week for 6 total doses (2 weeks) rather than 1.5% for 3 doses. We observed similar depigmentation with the lower dose of SADBE ( Figure S6 B), suggesting that additional dose/schedule options should be pursued before future application of this strategy.

Section: Discussion

We report the development of a collection of engineered murine models for giant congenital nevi, which permit us to distinguish proliferative from senescent phases of these lesions. These preclinical models complement previously reported Nras -transgenic models ( Ackermann et al., 2005 1. Ackermann, J. ∙ Frutschi, M. ∙ Kaloulis, K. ... Metastasizing melanoma formation caused by expression of activated N-RasQ61K on an INK4a-deficient background Cancer Res. 2005; 65 :4005-4011 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shakhova et al., 2012 60.

Cell Biol. 2012; 14 :882-890 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ) and permitted the identification of multipronged therapeutic approaches for nonsurgical regression of the lesions and prevention of melanoma formation. These data suggest potentially valuable treatment strategies for children with giant congenital nevi morbidity, which otherwise lack effective nonsurgical therapies. Along with alleviating the cosmetic and psychosocial effects of giant congenital melanocytic nevi ( Koot et al., 2000 35. Koot, H.M. ∙ de Waard-van der Spek, F. ∙ Peer, C.D. ...

Congenital melanocytic nevi needing treatment Dermatol. Ther. 2005; 18 :136-150 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), a driving purpose of this study is to diminish the increased melanoma risk arising from these lesions, as was strongly observed following 1 week (3 treatments) of topical SADBE in our mouse models. It is important to note that the melanoma risk in patients with CMN is not fully confined to cutaneous locations, as deeper melanocytic populations may exist, due to differences in the developmental states in which the nevus formed (oncogenic mutation). Nonetheless, cutaneous melanomagenesis is a significant challenge in these patients and likely contributes importantly to current parental decisions to seek debilitating surgical resections. The plausibility of exploiting the proinflammatory hapten SADBE is supported by its active use in several unrelated clinical contexts ( Happle et al., 1980 23. Happle, R. ∙ Kalveram, K.J. ∙ Büchner, U. ...

Dermatol. 2000; 17 :315-318 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as anecdotal reports of vitiligo-like depigmentation in humans, where the agent was used topically for other indications such as alopecia areata ( Sakai et al., 2020 55. Sakai, K. ∙ Fukushima, S. ∙ Mizuhashi, S. ... Effect of topical immunotherapy with squaric acid dibutylester for alopecia areata in Japanese patients Allergol.

[Pigmentation abnormalities in the course of topical immunotherapy of alopecia areata] G. Ital. Dermatol. Venereol. 1989; 124 :31-32 PubMed Google Scholar ). Although SADBE achieved melanocyte clearance, we emphasize the value in further interrogating kinase-targeting agents that, despite requiring further development as local-cutaneous drugs, offer potential advantages of specific molecular targeting. Mechanistically, melanocyte clearance utilizes recruitment of macrophages into the skin. Other studies in mice ( Feng et al., 2017 17. Feng, J. ∙ Yang, P. ∙ Mack, M.R. ...

Chronic delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction as a means to treat alopecia areata Clin. Exp.

Complete remission of Merkel cell carcinoma of the scalp with local and regional metastases after topical treatment with dinitrochlorbenzol J Am Acad Dermatol. 2004; 50 :965-969 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) have demonstrated macrophage recruitment by haptens suggesting that the macrophage recruitment observed here is unlikely to be particular to nevi or SADBE. Our RNA-seq data of SADBE-treated mice revealed multiple macrophage cytokines, such as CCL2 ( Fuentes et al., 1995 18. Fuentes, M.E. ∙ Durham, S.K. ∙ Swerdel, M.R. ... Controlled recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to specific organs through transgenic expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 J.

JE/MCP-1: an early-response gene encodes a monocyte-specific cytokine Cancer Cells. 1991; 3 :517-524 PubMed Google Scholar ) and CCL7 ( Xuan et al., 2015 72. Xuan, W. ∙ Qu, Q. ∙ Zheng, B. ... The chemotaxis of M1 and M2 macrophages is regulated by different chemokines J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 97 :61-69 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as the monocyte recruiting chemokine CCL8 ( Ji et al., 2019 29. Ji, J. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... CCL8 enhances sensitivity of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma to photodynamic therapy by recruiting M1 macrophages Photodiagnosis Photodyn. Ther. 2019; 26 :235-243 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) and macrophage differentiating cytokine CSF (colony stimulating factor)-1 ( Jones and Ricardo, 2013 31. Jones, C.V. ∙ Ricardo, S.D. Macrophages and CSF-1: implications for development and beyond Organogenesis. 2013; 9 :249-260 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may contribute to macrophage recruitment to the treated area. Furthermore, the TNFα signaling pathway was found to be highly upregulated after SADBE treatment. TNFα can elevate cytotoxic activity of macrophages ( Salim et al., 2016 56. Salim, T. ∙ Sershen, C.L. ∙ May, E.E. Investigating the role of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma activation on the dynamics of iNOS gene expression in LPS stimulated macrophages PLoS One. 2016; 11 :e0153289 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, TNFα is also able to affect both the growth and melanogenesis of melanocytes ( Englaro et al., 1999 16. Englaro, W. ∙ Bahadoran, P. ∙ Bertolotto, C. ... Tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated inhibition of melanogenesis is dependent on nuclear factor kappa B activation Oncogene. 1999; 18 :1553-1559 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hu et al., 2002 27. Hu, D.-N. ∙ McCormick, S. ∙ Mehta, S. Effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on the growth and melanogenesis of human uveal melanocytes in vitro Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43 :1089 Google Scholar ). In addition, increased levels of TNFα were found in vitiligo lesions, and exposure of melanocytes to TNFα was reported to downregulate MITF-M and induces apoptosis ( Singh et al., 2021 62. Singh, M. ∙ Mansuri, M.S. ∙ Kadam, A. ... Tumor necrosis factor-alpha affects melanocyte survival and melanin synthesis via multiple pathways in vitiligo Cytokine. 2021; 140 :155432 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). TNFα is produced predominantly by macrophages ( Riches et al., 1996 52. Riches, D.W. ∙ Chan, E.D. ∙ Winston, B.W. TNF-alpha-induced regulation and signalling in macrophages Immunobiology. 1996; 195 :477-490 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, TNFα induction represents a candidate mechanism of melanocyte/nevocyte reduction either by elevating cytotoxic activity of macrophages or by inducing melanocyte apoptosis. Since our GO analysis revealed phagocytosis as an enriched pathway, this process may participate in nevus clearance. Our functional data demonstrated that macrophage depletion impeded SADBE’s efficacy at nevus regression, and we believe future studies could further clarify exactly which macrophage functions contribute to this activity. In our studies, manipulations favoring proinflammatory macrophages enhanced melanocyte clearance, suggesting that future strategies to modulate this macrophage population might further refine the selectivity of the treatment. Interestingly, our LISA analysis and GSEA pathway analysis revealed many transcription factors involved in immune system and interferon-α pathway activity to be highly regulated in both mouse and human CMN. This could be as a result of the senescent characteristics of the nevi that can induce the senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( Coppé et al., 2010 12. Coppé, J.P. ∙ Desprez, P.Y. ∙ Krtolica, A. ... The senescence-associated secretory phenotype: the dark side of tumor suppression Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2010; 5 :99-118 Crossref Scopus (3376) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given clinical anecdotes of melanocyte loss after SADBE in settings independent of CMN, these findings suggest potential applications for other conditions where melanocyte clearance may be beneficial, such as cases where distinct driver oncogenes drive melanocytic neoplasia. Collectively, this study provides preclinical genetically driven and human-engrafted congenital nevus models that show translational potential for future human clinical testing.
In this proof-of-principle study, several murine models of congenital giant nevi are developed, and various treatments are tested to regress the lesions. However, there are several limitations. They are as follows: (1) Although genetically matching the NRAS Q61R gene driving many human CMNs, the nevi are present within mouse skin that differs structurally from human skin. For example, interfollicular dorsal skin in mice does not normally contain melanocytes, and ear skin, which does contain epidermal melanocytes in mouse, is particularly thin, lacking barrier features of human skin. (2) A variety of kinase-targeting agents demonstrated significant regressions of the CMN cells in the mouse CMN lesions. However, these agents have not been developed for either topical or injected cutaneous delivery. Therefore, the feasibility of delivering these agents into human skin awaits further study. (3) SADBE efficiently regresses CMN cells in several of the genetically engineered mouse CMN models. However, it is unknown how the relative dosing of SADBE in mouse will apply to humans, a question which requires additional evaluation. (4) SADBE also regressed ∼90% of human CMNs within resected human CMN specimens, xenografted onto immunodeficient mice, and recruited macrophages into the CMN xenografts. However, the immunodeficient background of the xenograft recipients remains an imperfect predictor of in vivo responses in immune-intact human skin.

Melanocyte-specific Nras Q61R expression was induced by crossing LSL- Nras Q61R mice ( Burd et al., 2014 7. Burd, C.E. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Huynh, M.V. ... Mutation-specific RAS oncogenicity explains NRAS codon 61 selection in melanoma Cancer Discov. 2014; 4 :1418-1429 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ) (generated by Drs. Christin Burd and Norman Sharpless, University of North Carolina) with melanocyte-targeted Cre recombinase transgenic mice containing either Dct promoter-driven Cre ( Dct -Cre mice ( Guyonneau et al., 2004 22.

Cre-mediated recombination in the skin melanocyte lineage Genesis. 2003; 36 :73-80 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), kindly provided by Dr. Lionel Larue, Institut Curie, Paris, France), or inducible Tyr promoter-driven CreER T2 ( Tyr -CreER T2 mice) ( Bosenberg et al., 2006 6. Bosenberg, M. ∙ Muthusamy, V. ∙ Curley, D.P. ... Characterization of melanocyte-specific inducible Cre recombinase transgenic mice Genesis. 2006; 44 :262-267 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), kindly provided by Dr. Marcus Bosenberg, Yale University). To obtain a melanocyte-specific inducible Nras mutation, two-day- old female LSL- Nras Q61R newborn mice harboring Tyr -CreER T2 were painted topically with 25 mg/ml 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, #H6278) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), once daily for 1 week.
We measured the incidence of N ras Q61R mutation-driven melanoma formation in both Dct- Cre Nras Q61R mutant and tamoxifen-induced Tyr -CreER T2 Nras Q61R mutant mice. These experiments were performed with > 20 mice per group (both genders, classified by ages), and their survival curves were calculated by the log-rank test at a two-sided significance level of P <0.05.
Dorsal skin samples from Dct- Cre Nras Q61R/Q61R mutant mice were harvested at the ages indicated. Samples from three mice of each age group, with five to ten nonadjacent samples per mouse, were quantified. Nevus cell proliferation and senescence were measured by immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 (Leica Biosystems, #KI67-MM1-CE) and p16 Ink4a (Abcam, # ab54210), respectively and quantification of Ki67+MelanA+ double-positive proliferative nevus cells or p16+MelanA+ double-positive senescent nevus cells was calculated as a percentage of the total number of MelanA+ positive nevus cells.
Ear skin samples from three mice of each study group, with three to five non-adjacent samples per mouse, were quantified. The number of MelanA-positive nevus cells ( Figure 6 A) or iNOS-positive cells ( Figure 6 B) was measured and calculated per mm 2 unit area.
Selected therapeutic agents or vehicle controls were applied on Nras Q61R mutation-driven nevus lesions by either direct intralesional injection (paws) or topical application (ears and dorsal skin). Agents tested included: (1) small molecules targeting NRAS signaling pathways: binimetinib (MEK162) (Sellechkchem, #S7007), trametinib (GSK1120212) (Selleckchem, #S2673), and omipalisib (GSK2126458) (Selleckchem, #S2658); (2) the melanocyte-selective toxic agent, imatinib (STI571) (Selleckchem, #S2475); SADBE (squaric acid dibutylester) (Sigma-Aldrich, #339792). Details are provided in Table S1 For all topical hapten-based immunotherapies. Mice were sensitized with 2% SADBE in acetone which was applied to the right side of the shaved abdomen. Three days later, sensitized mice were challenged with the same drug applied to the right ear or dorsal skin. An identical quantity of acetone (without SADBE) was administered topically to the left ear or dorsal skin as control. All drug treatments in mice were performed under isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. Mice were examined for signs of toxicity and for depigmentation during each treatment. Animals were euthanized in accordance with a set schedule, and the treated lesions were collected and processed for assessment of melanocyte destruction. Each sample was compared to the vehicle control from the same mouse, and five mice per treatment group were typically used excluding 0.5% SADBE 3 times per week for 2 weeks, where 3 mice per treatment group were used ( Figure S4 B).
Skin samples were taken from euthanized mice, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #50-980-487) overnight at 4°C, and embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. 5 μm sections were prepared from tissue blocks and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Epredia, #7231) for histologic analysis. Fontana-Masson silver stain (Abcam, #ab150669) was used to detect the melanin pigments following the provided protocol with one modification by leaving the slides in Ammoniacal Silver solution for 40 minutes rather than the recommended 30 minutes for melanin, and stained sections were counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Abcam, #ab246831). Stained images were captured using a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer, and analyzed using NDP.view2 software (Hamamatsu).
For immunostaining, sections were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval and incubated with primary antibodies against TRP2/DCT (1:100) or SOX10 (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-74439, #sc-365692); MITF (1:50) or Ki67 (1:50) (Leica Biosystems, #NCL-L-MITF, #KI67-MM1-CE); S100 (1:2000) or HMB-45 (1:100) (DAKO, #Z031129-2, #M0634); p-p44/42 MAPK (1:50), p-MEK1/2 (1:50), PCNA (1:2000), or CD8 (1:400) (Cell Signaling Technology, #4370, #2338, #2586); CD163 (1:100) (Biorbyt, #orb13303); CD161 (1:50) (Novus Biologicals, #NBP2-14844); NRASQ61R (1:100), p16INK4A (1:1000), MelanA (1:500), CD11c (1:100), CD3 (1:100), or CD4 (1:500) (Abcam, #ab227658, #ab54210, #ab210546, #ab33483, #ab33483, #ab11089, #ab183685). Stained images were captured using a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope and an AxioCam MRC digital camera for brightfield or Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 interline CCD camera for fluorescence, and Ziess Zen software, version 2.3 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC, Thornwood, NY, USA). Immunofluorescence-stained sections were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma Aldrich, #D9542), and ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health [NIH]) ( Schneider et al., 2012 58. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (43944) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for image processing and analysis. Skin tissue images were obtained with a Nikon SMZ1500 stereomicroscope, a Nikon DS-Ri2 microscope camera, and NIS Elements imaging software, version 4.30 (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA).
DNA from 5-10 5um sections taken from paraffin blocks, was extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, #56404). PCR reactions were run with approximately 200ng of DNA following the established genotyping test PCR for the Dct :CRE, Nras mice. PCR products were run on a QIAxcel to visualize the bands and determine estimated concentrations. Toe DNA samples were collected during routine genotyping of pups to use as controls.
750 μg of the following antibodies were IP injected on day 7, 4, and 2 prior to sensitization with SADBE, and 300 μg on days 0 (sensitization with 2% SADBE), 3, 5, 7, 10: InVivoMAb anti-mouse CD4_GK1.5 clone (BioXCell, #BE0003-1), InVivoMAb anti-mouse CD8α _2.43 clone ( BioXCell, #BE0061), InVivoMAb anti-rat IgG2b isotype control; anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin_LTF-2 clone (BioXCell, #BE0090), and InVivoMAb anti-mouse F4/80_CI:A3-1 clone (BioXCell, #BE0206).
Whole skin sections were harvested from treated areas of Dct -Cre Nras Q61R/+ mice 72 hours after treatment with 2% SADBE or vehicle control (acetone) and stored in RNAlater (Ambion/Life Technologies, #AM7020). Total RNA was isolated from skin using the RNeasy Plus Universal Kit (Qiagen, #73404) with disruption and homogenization using the TissueLyser II system (Qiagen). All extracted RNA samples possessed RIN > 8.0 by Agilent TapeStation System with High Sensitivity RNA Screen Tape (Agilent Technologies, #5067-55779) and proceeded for NGS library construction with Illumina Stranded mRNA Prep, Ligation kit (Illumina, #20040534). Each amplified, then bead-cleaned library was assessed for its quality and quantity by Agilent TapeStation with High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape and Qubit fluorometer 4.0.(Invitrogen), respectively. Each library was normalized at 4 nM, then pooled, denatured, and loaded onto the Illumina NextSeq550 at 2x74 base-pair specification. The generated FastQ files were processed under DRAGEN FastQC bioinformatic pipeline (Illumina) to assess the overall quality of the data for adapter contamination or GC content.
FFPE blocks of tumor and control tissues(n=18) were cut at 8 um thickness and RNA was extracted with RNA FFPE Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, #R1009) following manufacturer recommendations. Extracted RNA quality was assessed by the Agilent Bioanalyzer system with Eukaryote Total RNA Pico assay (Agilent Technologies, #G2938-90046). The overall quantity was measured by Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer followed by Quant-it RiboGreen RNA Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, #R11490) to optimize inputs for NGS library construction. The maximum input of 1 ug was processed for library construction with Stranded total RNA with ligation with Ribozero plus kit (Illumina, #20037135). Each amplified then bead-cleaned library was assessed for its quality and quantity by Agilent TapeStation with High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTapes and Qubit fluorometer 4.0. (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA), respectively. Each library was normalized at 4 nM, then pooled, denatured, and loaded onto the Illumina NextSeq550 targeting 80 million reads per sample at 1x76 base-pair specification. The generated FastQ files were processed under DRAGEN FastQC bioinformatic pipeline (Illumina) to assess the overall quality of the data for adapter contamination or GC content.
We performed RNA-seq and differential expression analysis for in-house mouse RNA-seq datasets and one publicly available human nevi cohort. Read alignment was preformed using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 14. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by transcript quantification using Salmon ( Patro et al., 2017 45. Patro, R. ∙ Duggal, G. ∙ Love, M.I. ... Salmon provides fast and bias-aware quantification of transcript expression Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :417-419 Crossref Scopus (5683) PubMed Google Scholar ), and differential analysis using DESeq2( Love et al., 2014 39. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ) that compares SADBE-treated samples and control samples. The set of differentially expressed genes were determined using absolute LogFoldChange>1 and FDR<0.01. To investigate macrophage-related genes, we obtained macrophage gene lists from LM22 ( Newman et al., 2015 43. Newman, A.M. ∙ Liu, C.L. ∙ Green, M.R. ... Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :453-457 Crossref Scopus (7546) PubMed Google Scholar ) which includes markers for macrophage states M0, M1, and M2. We also obtained from TIDE ( Jiang et al., 2018 30. Jiang, P. ∙ Gu, S. ∙ Pan, D. ... Signatures of T cell dysfunction and exclusion predict cancer immunotherapy response Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1550-1558 Crossref Scopus (2802) PubMed Google Scholar ) the gene correlation scores with tumor M2 macrophage levels. For the systematic ( Jiang et al., 2018 30. Jiang, P. ∙ Gu, S. ∙ Pan, D. ... Signatures of T cell dysfunction and exclusion predict cancer immunotherapy response Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1550-1558 Crossref Scopus (2802) PubMed Google Scholar ) pathway analysis on differentially expressed genes, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis using R packages fgsea( Korotkevich et al., 2021 36. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Budin, N. ... Fast gene set enrichment analysis Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; 060012 Google Scholar ) and clusterProfiler( Yu et al., 2012 75. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters Omics. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (18506) PubMed Google Scholar ). The above analysis was performed on both mouse and human RNA-seq datasets using corresponding genomic references in each species; specifically, for the mouse set with untreated nevi, normal, and melanoma, differential expression was carried out using protein-coding genes to facilitate pathway interpretation between nevi and normal skin samples. After obtaining differential gene lists, we applied LISA ( Qin et al., 2020 51. Qin, Q. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Zheng, R. ... Lisa: inferring transcriptional regulators through integrative modeling of public chromatin accessibility and ChIP-seq data Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :32 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) to infer transcriptional regulators using public ChIP-seq profiles.
Discarded de-identified nevus tissue was obtained under IRB approved protocol 2017P000992 (Mass General Brigham Healthcare). Nevi were transplanted onto the back of SHO (Charles River Laboratories, MA, USA) 62-day-old female mice according to previous published work ( Schiferle et al., 2021 57. Schiferle, E.B. ∙ Cheon, S.Y. ∙ Ham, S. ... Rejection of benign melanocytic nevi by nevus-resident CD4 + T cells Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 :eabg4498 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, using a DermaBlade Shave Biopsy Instrument (AccuTec Blades Inc., #72-0001-0000) under sterile conditions, subcutaneous dermal fat was removed from the dermal side of the giant nevus to enhance vascularization and grafting efficiency. Mice were anesthetized and placed on a heating pad. The surgical site was sterilized with 70% ethanol. Nevi were transplanted onto recipient mice using surgical grade sutures and were bandaged using Vaseline gauze and elastic adhesive bandage. Mice were placed on sulfadiazine/trimethoprim antibiotics (Equisul-SDT Oral Suspension) (Aurora Pharmaceuticals, #sc-395895Rx) after transplantation. Bandages were removed 5 to 7 days after surgery and graft sutures were removed 14 days post-surgery.
8 xenografts from one donor were implanted on 4 SHO 62-day-old female mice and 2 xenografts from an additional donor were implanted on 1 SHO mouse. For melanocyte cell count, topical application of 1% SADBE using a cotton tip was performed twice a week for 8 months on 3 of the xenografts, 5 of the xenografts from the same donor received acetone control. Treatments did not induce recognized side effects; behavior remained normal and morphologic structure of the skin remained intact with minimal surrounding erythema. For macrophage cell counts, 2 additional xenografts from a different donor were treated with 1% SADBE or acetone control for 2 weeks after which the xenografts were harvested for further F4/80 macrophage staining.
Formalin–fixed paraffin-embedded CMN xenografts (5 μm) were labeled with the following antibodies: TRP2 antibody (1:100) (Abcam, #ab74073) and F4/80 antibody (1:100) (Abcam, #ab16911). Deparaffinization of slides was performed with 100% xylene for 2x5 min, followed by 100, 90, 70, 50 and 30% ethanol for 2 min each. Slides were washed in PBS for 5 min. Permeabilization was conducted in 0.2% triton-X for 5 min and then the slides were washed 2x3 min in 0.01% PBS-tween 20. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the slides with citrate buffer (pH = 6) at 95 °C for 20 minutes. Sections were washed with 0.01% PBS-tween 20 for 3x3 min and blocked for 1 hour with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 5% BSA. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Sections were washed with 0.01% PBS-tween 20 for 3x3 min, followed by secondary antibody incubation [1:500; goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor® 488-AffiniPure (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, #111-545-144), or 1:500 Alexa Fluor® 594 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, #711-585-152)] for 2 hours at room temperature. Slides were washed 3x3 min with 0.01% PBS-tween 20, incubated with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, #D9542) for 5 minutes for nuclei staining and coverslipped using Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, #0100-01). Slides were placed at 4 ° C for 48 hours before imaging.
Photomicrographs were obtained under either×20 or×40 objective using a Ziess Axio Photo Observer Microscope or Nikon SMZ1500 stereomicroscope. ImageJ (National Institutes of Health [NIH]) was used to identify cells based on size, circularity, nuclear presence, and intensity. Positive cells were counted in both the epidermis and dermis of each specimen for F4/80 and throughout epidermis for TRP2. In each area, the number of positive cells was counted and reported in relationship to the total number of DAPI-positive cells. Thus, results are expressed as a percentage of positive cells for each marker analyzed per total cells. Quantifications were done on multiple sections from each CMN xenograft, typically 3-20 images per sample.
All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 7 software, and the evaluations were conducted by using a Student’s t-test, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test, or log-rank test for survival analysis. A probability value of P <0.05 was considered statistically significant ( ∗ P <0.05; ∗∗ P <0.01; ∗∗∗ P <0.001; ∗∗∗∗ P <0.0001).
