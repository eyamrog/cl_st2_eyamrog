Title: Onco-fetal Reprogramming of Endothelial Cells Drives Immunosuppressive Macrophages in Hepatocellular Carcinoma


Abstract: Summary

We employed scRNA sequencing to extensively characterize the cellular landscape of human liver from development to disease. Analysis of ∼212,000 cells representing human fetal, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and mouse liver revealed remarkable fetal-like reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, the HCC ecosystem displayed features reminiscent of fetal development, including re-emergence of fetal-associated endothelial cells (PLVAP/VEGFR2) and fetal-like (FOLR2) tumor-associated macrophages. In a cross-species comparative analysis, we discovered remarkable similarity between mouse embryonic, fetal-liver, and tumor macrophages. Spatial transcriptomics further revealed a shared onco-fetal ecosystem between fetal liver and HCC. Furthermore, gene regulatory analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and in vitro functional assays implicated VEGF and NOTCH signaling in maintaining onco-fetal ecosystem. Taken together, we report a shared immunosuppressive onco-fetal ecosystem in fetal liver and HCC. Our results unravel a previously unexplored onco-fetal reprogramming of the tumor ecosystem, provide novel targets for therapeutic interventions in HCC, and open avenues for identifying similar paradigms in other cancers and disease.

Section: Introduction

Liver plays an essential role in human physiology, from serving as the predominant site of early fetal hematopoiesis ( Christensen et al., 2004 14. Christensen, J.L. ∙ Wright, D.E. ∙ Wagers, A.J. ... Circulation and chemotaxis of fetal hematopoietic stem cells PLoS Biol. 2004; 2 :E75 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ) to being a key metabolic regulator of dietary nutrients, including lipids, sugars, and proteins through adult homeostasis ( Rui, 2014 39. Rui, L. Comprehensive Physiology Compr. Physiol. 2014; 4 :177-197 Crossref Scopus (1414) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, liver dysfunctions can result in several life-threatening conditions, including NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which altogether account for ∼2 million deaths per year ( Williams et al., 2014 50. Williams, R. ∙ Aspinall, R. ∙ Bellis, M. ... Addressing liver disease in the UK: a blueprint for attaining excellence in health care and reducing premature mortality from lifestyle issues of excess consumption of alcohol, obesity, and viral hepatitis Lancet. 2014; 384 :1953-1997 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ). Liver is unique for its remarkable regenerative potential, which helps in overcoming acute injury and in maintaining the integrity of the hepatobiliary system. Liver injury and subsequent inflammatory responses serves as a signal for regeneration ( Forbes and Newsome, 2016 18. Forbes, S.J. ∙ Newsome, P.N. Liver regeneration - mechanisms and models to clinical application Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 13 :473-485 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, severe liver injury or loss of regenerative potential could lead to irreparable damage. Liver diseases are mainly induced by dietary (drugs/alcohol) or viral (hepatitis A/B/C) factors resulting in fatty liver, cirrhosis, and eventually carcinomas ( Williams et al., 2014 50. Williams, R. ∙ Aspinall, R. ∙ Bellis, M. ... Addressing liver disease in the UK: a blueprint for attaining excellence in health care and reducing premature mortality from lifestyle issues of excess consumption of alcohol, obesity, and viral hepatitis Lancet. 2014; 384 :1953-1997 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Among these, HCC is the second most prevalent cause of cancer-associated mortalities worldwide ( Yang et al., 2019 51. Yang, J.D. ∙ Hainaut, P. ∙ Gores, G.J. ... A global view of hepatocellular carcinoma: trends, risk, prevention and management Nat. Rev. Gastroentero. Hepatol. 2019; 16 :589-604 Crossref Scopus (2414) PubMed Google Scholar ). Early-stage HCC may be treated with surgical resection or organ transplantation and advanced disease by systemic therapy; however, treatment is associated with high overall relapse rates ( Bruix and Sherman, 2011 8. Bruix, J. ∙ Sherman, M. Management of hepatocellular carcinoma: an update Hepatology. 2011; 53 :1020-1022 Crossref Scopus (7005) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tumors comprise diverse cell types, and there exists a constant “arms race” between the immune system and transformed cells ( Tabassum and Polyak, 2015 47. Tabassum, D.P. ∙ Polyak, K. Tumorigenesis: it takes a village Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15 :473-483 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). These interactions lead to either the elimination or successful colonization of tumor cells. A favorable tumor ecosystem allows malignant cells to survive nutrient deprivation and immunological selection pressures. Notably, different regions of tumor could represent heterogeneity in the tumor ecosystem constituting distinct tumor, stromal, and immune cell types ( McGranahan and Swanton, 2017 27. McGranahan, N. ∙ Swanton, C. Clonal Heterogeneity and Tumor Evolution: Past, Present, and the Future Cell. 2017; 168 :613-628 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1711) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smith and Hodges, 2019 44. Smith, E.A. ∙ Hodges, H.C. The Spatial and Genomic Hierarchy of Tumor Ecosystems Revealed by Single-Cell Technologies Trends Cancer. 2019; 5 :411-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). This regional intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) could foster variability in cell-cell interactions. Moreover, heterogeneity of tumor ecosystem cells such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), endothelial cells (ECs), and immune cells could further impact the therapeutic responses in the clinic. However, a systematic study defining the transcriptomic, spatial, and functional landscape of ITH and the resultant unique cell-cell interactions in the HCC ecosystem has remained elusive.
Tumor cells are known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, which facilitates the cellular diversity and tumor evolution ( Cassetta et al., 2019 11. Cassetta, L. ∙ Fragkogianni, S. ∙ Sims, A.H. ... Human Tumor-Associated Macrophage and Monocyte Transcriptional Landscapes Reveal Cancer-Specific Reprogramming, Biomarkers, and Therapeutic Targets Cancer Cell. 2019; 35 :588-602 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (549) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sharma et al., 2018 42. Sharma, A. ∙ Cao, E.Y. ∙ Kumar, V. ... Longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing of patient-derived primary cells reveals drug-induced infidelity in stem cell hierarchy Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4931 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Documented similarities between embryonic development and tumorigenesis have given credence to the notion that tumor cells can reprogram and/or transdifferentiate into cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) ( Clevers, 2011 15. Clevers, H. The cancer stem cell: premises, promises and challenges Nat. Med. 2011; 17 :313-319 Crossref Scopus (1582) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, some malignant cells are known to express antigens specific to fetal development, a classic example being the expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in HCC ( Behne and Copur, 2012 4. Behne, T. ∙ Copur, M.S. Biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma Int. J. Hepatol. 2012; 2012 :859076 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, these studies link phenotypic characteristics of malignant cells with early developmental programs. However, the ability of the tumor ecosystem to recapitulate early developmental hallmarks remains to be investigated. In this study, we set out to generate a comprehensive atlas of human liver encompassing fetal development, adult homeostasis, and carcinoma. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand liver biology and its implications in human disease.
Here, we comprehensively profiled ∼212,000 single cells across human fetal liver (∼60,000), HCC (adjacent normal ∼16,500; tumor ∼57,200), and mouse models (∼79,000). We report ∼30 major clusters from fetal, adjacent normal, and tumor tissues, representing diverse cell types in human liver. Importantly, through systematic interrogations of transcriptional profiles, cellular interactions, gene regulatory networks, and spatial transcriptomics, we present a comparative analyses of liver development and cancer. This lead to identification of a novel immune-suppressive “onco-fetal ecosystem” in HCC, comprising shared stromal and immune cell types as well as signaling components in fetal liver and HCC. Furthermore, we employed a state-of-the-art genetic lineage tracing mouse model to establish the ontogeny of various TAM sub-populations in HCC. Our in vitro cell-cell interaction and spatial transcriptomics analysis provided further insights into cellular communications that facilitate the immunosuppressive onco-fetal reprogramming of the tumor ecosystem. Taken together, our work provides a new paradigm of immunosuppressive onco-fetal tumor microenvironment (TME) via VEGF/NOTCH signaling in HCC.

Section: Results

To understand the complexity of tumor ecosystem and dynamic reciprocal interactions between malignant, stromal, and immune cells in HCC, we employed a droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics approach (10× chromium). HCC is mainly driven by viral or metabolic factors ( Villanueva, 2019 49. Villanueva, A. Hepatocellular Carcinoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2019; 380 :1450-1462 Crossref Scopus (2870) PubMed Google Scholar ); we included both viral positive (chronic hepatitis B) and negative tumors in our study. Additionally, in order to generate a comprehensive single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of spatial ITH, we sampled tumor tissues from multiple sectors of surgically resected HCC with clearly demarcated core and peripheral regions ( Zhai et al., 2017 54. Zhai, W. ∙ Lim, T.K.-H. ∙ Zhang, T. ... The spatial organization of intra-tumour heterogeneity and evolutionary trajectories of metastases in hepatocellular carcinoma Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :4565 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). As reference, we profiled both tumor adjacent “normal” tissues as well as one “healthy normal” obtained from a liver transplant donor. Since most tissue dissociation protocols adversely affect the recovery of non-immune cells ( Aizarani et al., 2019 2. Aizarani, N. ∙ Saviano, A. ∙ Sagar ... A human liver cell atlas reveals heterogeneity and epithelial progenitors Nature. 2019; 572 :199-204 Crossref Scopus (598) PubMed Google Scholar ; MacParland et al., 2018 25. MacParland, S.A. ∙ Liu, J.C. ∙ Ma, X.-Z. ... Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic macrophage populations Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4383 Crossref Scopus (791) PubMed Google Scholar ), we enriched these cells by magnetic sorting of CD45 + and CD45 – cells followed by 1:1 mixing before single-cell droplet generation ( Figure 1 A). First, we analyzed ∼74,000 cells (∼2,600 genes/cell) obtained from 57 sectors, from 14 HCC patients (5 HepB – and 9 HepB + ) as well as one healthy donor ( Figures 1 A–1F, S1 A, and S1 B; Table S1 ). Louvain clustering of these cells identified 29 distinct major clusters representing epithelial, immune, endothelial, and fibroblast populations ( Figures 1 B and 1F). Next, we employed lineage-specific markers to annotate Louvain clusters into major cell types of the liver, including B cells (MZB1; CD79A), T cells (CD3E; IL7R; CD8), NK (natural killer; GNLY; NKG7), myeloid (LYZ; CD14), fibroblast (ACTA2; THY1), endothelial (PECAM1; Von Willebrand factor [VWF]), and hepatocyte (ALB + ; KRT8 + ) cells ( Figure 1 B). In total, we identified one cluster (cl.) each of fibroblasts (cl. 13), bi-potent progenitors (cl. 24), B (cl. 18), mast cells (cl. 28), and Tregs (cl. 12); two of CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (cl. 3, 4); three of CD4 + T-helper cells (cl. 0, 5, 23) and myeloid cells (cl. 8, 10, 19); four of NK/NKT (cl. 1, 9, 15, 22); five of ECs (cl. 2, 6, 17, 26, 27); and seven of hepatocytes (cl. 7, 11, 14, 16, 20, 21, 25) ( Figure 1 B; Table S2 ).
Interestingly, we observed tumor and adjacent normal-specific clustering of certain cell types indicating potential remodeling of TME in HCC. We also discovered distinct endothelial and lymphoid cells as well as macrophages in the tumor core, periphery, and adjacent normal tissue ( Figure 1 C). Notably, we found fetal-liver-associated PLVAP + ECs ( Rantakari et al., 2016 38. Rantakari, P. ∙ Jäppinen, N. ∙ Lokka, E. ... Fetal liver endothelium regulates the seeding of tissue-resident macrophages Nature. 2016; 538 :392-396 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), CD163 + macrophages, and TIGIT + Treg cells were specifically enriched in tumor tissues, while cytotoxic CD8 + T cells and NKT cells were predominantly present in the adjacent normal tissue ( Figures 1 C and S1 D–S1H). In concordance with Zhang et al. (2019) 55. Zhang, Q. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Luo, N. ... Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell. 2019; 179 :829-845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (775) PubMed Google Scholar , we also observed a lack of any specific immune cell population in viral positive and negative tumors, indicating convergence of a “tumor phenotype” in both types of HCCs ( Figures 1 E and S1 C). Based on top differentially expressed genes, we identified unique markers for each of the 29 major clusters ( Figure 1 G; Table S3 ) and employed machine-learning algorithm “Garnett” ( Pliner et al., 2019 32. Pliner, H.A. ∙ Shendure, J. ∙ Trapnell, C. Supervised classification enables rapid annotation of cell atlases Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :983-986 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ) to assign signatures to each cluster. This allowed us to develop a cluster-agnostic approach for cell-type annotation ( Figures 1 H and S1 I). Overall, our comprehensive analysis of ∼74,000 single cells from normal and tumor tissue of the human liver provides an unprecedented opportunity to compare this atlas with other liver datasets ( Aizarani et al., 2019 2. Aizarani, N. ∙ Saviano, A. ∙ Sagar ...

Since we observed remarkable divergence between normal and tumor ecosystems, we set out to identify disease-specific cell types in further depth. We subdivided major clusters into T cells, NK/NKT cells, B cells, myeloid cells, ECs, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes followed by re-clustering of these cells types. Sub-clustering of T cells led to the identification of 20 clusters ( Figure S2 A). Interestingly, while there was a distinct enrichment of naive and regulatory CD4 + cells within the tumor, they noticeably lacked cytotoxic CD8 + cells, a classic hallmark of “non-inflamed” or “cold” ( Lambrechts et al., 2018 23. Lambrechts, D. ∙ Wauters, E. ∙ Boeckx, B. ... Phenotype molding of stromal cells in the lung tumor microenvironment Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1277-1289 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar ) tumors ( Lambrechts et al., 2018 23. Lambrechts, D. ∙ Wauters, E. ∙ Boeckx, B. ... Phenotype molding of stromal cells in the lung tumor microenvironment Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1277-1289 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 A). We further analyzed the frequencies of individual patient samples in each of the clusters, and tumor specificity followed by identification of cluster-specific markers ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Sub-clustering of NK cells led to identification of 10 clusters dividing NK cells into CD56 Bright , KLRC2 + (adaptive), and KLRC1 + (educated) populations ( Figures S2 D–S2I). In addition, we also identified a cluster of NKT cells. The CD56 Bright NK and NKT cells were specifically enriched in adjacent normal tissue, while tumor-infiltrating NK cells expressed KLRC1 and KLRC2, markers associated with memory-like NK cell ( Ram et al., 2018 35. Ram, D.R. ∙ Manickam, C. ∙ Hueber, B. ... Tracking KLRC2 (NKG2C)+ memory-like NK cells in SIV+ and rhCMV+ rhesus macaques PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007104 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2 E and S2F). Intriguingly, we identified previously unknown KRT81, KRT86, and MYOM2 positive NK cell populations ( Figures S2 E–S2I). Further investigations are warranted to understand the function of these new NK cell populations in the liver.
Sub-clustering of fibroblasts identified 9 clusters clearly delineating normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The CAFs in HCC expressed MYH11, ACTA2, THY1, and TAGLN, markers typically associated with activated fibroblasts ( Figures S2 J–S2M). Clustering of epithelial cells identified 13 hepatocyte (ALB + ) and one bi-potent (KRT8 + /KRT19 + ) clusters ( Figure S2 N). Interestingly, bi-potent cells were specific to normal tissue and were present in all individuals ( Figures S2 N–S2Q). In concordance with the recently published head and neck ( Puram et al., 2017 34. Puram, S.V. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Parikh, A.S. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Primary and Metastatic Tumor Ecosystems in Head and Neck Cancer Cell. 2017; 171 :1611-1624 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1398) PubMed Google Scholar ), lung ( Lambrechts et al., 2018 23. Lambrechts, D. ∙ Wauters, E. ∙ Boeckx, B. ... Phenotype molding of stromal cells in the lung tumor microenvironment Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1277-1289 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar ), and glioblastoma ( Neftel et al., 2019 29. Neftel, C. ∙ Laffy, J. ∙ Filbin, M.G. ... An Integrative Model of Cellular States, Plasticity, and Genetics for Glioblastoma Cell. 2019; 178 :835-849 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1153) PubMed Google Scholar ) tumor cell atlases, we also observed patient-specific clustering of tumor cells, highlighting the predominant effect of patient-specific driver and passenger mutations on the transcriptome of liver epithelial cells ( Figure 1 D). Nonetheless, the hepatocytes from multiple patients could be broadly clustered into four major populations of SOX4 + , SPINK1 + , MALAT1 + , and MALAT1 + /NEAT1 + cells ( Figures S2 O–S2Q). These subpopulations were present in more than one patient, indicating shared molecular signatures in the tumor epithelium.
Among the major clusters obtained from single-cell liver atlas, the two cell types that were found to be strikingly different between tumor and adjacent normal tissues are ECs and macrophages. Therefore, we re-analyzed ECs and myeloid subpopulations by sub-clustering. A total of 11,672 ECs formed 11 clusters ( Figure 2 A), and, apart from the TFF3 + lymphatic ECs, all other cell types were specific to either normal or tumor tissues ( Figures 2 B and S3 A–S3C). Specifically, PLPP3 + , IGFBP3 + , and PLVAP + ECs were enriched in the tumor tissue. Among these, plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) is known to play an important role in liver development and disease ( Ramachandran et al., 2019 36. Ramachandran, P. ∙ Dobie, R. ∙ Wilson-Kanamori, J.R. ... Resolving the fibrotic niche of human liver cirrhosis at single-cell level Nature. 2019; 575 :512-518 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rantakari et al., 2016 38. Rantakari, P. ∙ Jäppinen, N. ∙ Lokka, E. ... Fetal liver endothelium regulates the seeding of tissue-resident macrophages Nature. 2016; 538 :392-396 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, based on expression of VEGFR2, NRP1 (cl. 3), ACKR1 (cl. 9), and HLA-DR (cl. 4), we observed three HCC-specific clusters of PLVAP + ECs ( Figures 2 C). Further, to identify the possible origin of tumor-specific PLVAP + ECs, we performed RNA velocity analysis ( La Manno et al., 2018 22. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1812) PubMed Google Scholar ). RNA velocity predicted tumor-specific PLVAP + ECs likely originate from an intermediate ECs sub-population ( Figure 2 D). Interestingly, cl. -3-associated genes displayed both faster (PLVAP and NRP1) and slower (VEGFR2) RNA velocity suggesting a dynamics transcriptional state of these cells ( Figure 2 E).
Sub-clustering of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) led to identification of two monocyte, three dendritic cells (DC1, DC2, and pDCs) ( Dutertre et al., 2019 16. Dutertre, C.-A. ∙ Becht, E. ∙ Irac, S.E. ... Single-Cell Analysis of Human Mononuclear Phagocytes Reveals Subset-Defining Markers and Identifies Circulating Inflammatory Dendritic Cells Immunity. 2019; 51 :573-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ), and four macrophage clusters in the liver ( Figure 2 F; Table S4 ). The macrophage populations were predominantly present in tumor, while DCs and monocytes were enriched in normal tissue ( Figures 2 G and S3 D–S3F). The expression of macrophage-associated scavenger receptor CD163 further sub-divided the TAMs into CD163 high TAM1, and CD163 low TAM2/TAM3 subpopulations ( Figures 2 H and S3 E). Differential gene expression analysis identified the unique markers of TAM subpopulations, namely, the Folate Receptor Beta (FOLR2) expressing TAM1, Osteopontin (SPP1) positive TAM2, and Metallothionein 1G (MT1G)-enriched TAM3 ( Figures 2 H and 2I). As TAMs can be either monocyte derived or tissue resident, RNA velocity analysis was employed to explore the lineage trajectories of the HCC macrophage populations. Our analysis revealed that two clusters of FOLR2 + TAM1 populations (clusters 1 and 7) may have different origins ( Figure 2 J). RNA velocity analysis also suggested that one of the FOLR2 + TAM1 cluster could be monocyte derived (cl. 7) while another appears to be embryonic-origin tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) (cl. 1) ( Figure 2 J). Interestingly, the monocyte-derived FOLR2 + cluster showed higher expression of HES1 compared to the tissue-resident FOLR2 + cluster, implying a potential role for Notch signaling in the emergence of subset of TAM1 ( Figures 2 K and 2L). These results suggest that in HCC a population of monocyte-derived macrophages may be reprogramed to acquire an fetal-like phenotype.
Next, we employed flow cytometry to validate the TAM subpopulation based on protein markers. In concordance with scRNA-seq data, we detected enrichment of CD163 high /CD206 high TAM1 and CD163 low /CD206 low TAM2/TAM3 subpopulations in HCC ( Figures S3 G and S3H). We also performed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples to further validate the expression of FOLR2 and SPP1 in distinct macrophage populations. In addition to validating the scRNA-seq and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) data, we also observed spatially distinct localization of CD163 + /FOLR2 + (TAM1) and CD163 – /SPP1 + (TAM2) subpopulations in the tumor tissue ( Figures S3 I and S3K). Thus, our comprehensive scRNA-seq profiling, combined with FACS and FISH-based validation, provides unique insights into macrophage heterogeneity in HCC. It also establishes FOLR2 and SPP1 as distinctive markers of the TAM1 and TAM2 subpopulations in HCC. Similarly, we employed RNA-FISH to detect PLVAP expression in normal and tumor ECs and observed that PLVAP expression is in fact specific to the tumor tissue ( Figures S3 J and S3L). These results corroborate observations from the scRNA-seq atlas and establish specific markers for endothelial and macrophage populations, suggesting the presence of fetal-associated PLVAP + EC and embryonic-like FOLR2 + TAM1in HCC.
Tumor cells are known to recapitulate signatures of early fetal development including acquisition of stem-like features, EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition), and expression of onco-fetoproteins ( Yong et al., 2013 52. Yong, K.J. ∙ Gao, C. ∙ Lim, J.S.J. ... Oncofetal gene SALL4 in aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368 :2266-2276 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, fetal-like reprogramming of the tumor ecosystem remains to be investigated. One of the most striking observations in our data is the enrichment of PLVAP + /NRP1 + /VEGFR2 + ECs in tumor tissue. Incidentally, a recent report described the critical function of PLVAP + /NRP1 + ECs in the seeding of TRMs during murine fetal-liver development ( Rantakari et al., 2016 38. Rantakari, P. ∙ Jäppinen, N. ∙ Lokka, E. ... Fetal liver endothelium regulates the seeding of tissue-resident macrophages Nature. 2016; 538 :392-396 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized that the presence of PLVAP + ECs in tumors may also facilitate the emergence of fetal-like macrophages in the TME, thereby orchestrating an onco-fetal reprogramming of TME. To investigate this, we performed scRNA-seq on human fetal-liver tissues at the estimated gestational age (EGA) of 16 and 21 weeks and aggregated this dataset (by employing cell aggr function of CellRanger algorithm) with the HCC scRNA-seq data. A total of ∼105,000 single cells from human fetal liver and HCC were analyzed ( Figures 3 A and S3 M), and the aggregated single-cell atlas displayed remarkable similarities between fetal and tumor endothelial, as well as myeloid cells ( Figure 3 B). The analysis of ECs formed 10 clusters, 3 of which were specific to fetal endothelium suggesting distinct roles of fetal ECs during early development. Importantly, we discovered that PLVAP + ECs mainly enriched in fetal and tumor tissues, while being relatively absent during normal homeostasis. Most importantly, these results further corroborate the possibility of fetal-like reprogramming of PLVAP + ECs in HCC ( Figures 3 C–3E).
Analysis of the MNPs also revealed similar remarkable insights. We identified 14 clusters in the aggregated fetal and HCC dataset, including five clusters of predominantly fetal-associated cells, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), megakaryocytes, monocyte, DCs, and macrophage populations ( Figure 3 F). Interestingly, we observed intermixing of cells from HCC and fetal tissues in the macrophage, DC, and monocyte clusters. The most surprising observation was an unexpected similarity between the fetal-liver macrophage (FLM, cl. 6) and TAM1 subpopulations. Both FLM and TAM1 populations exhibited a unique FOLR2 high /CD163 high gene expression signature that was clearly distinct from the TAM2 (SPP1 + ) and TAM3 (MT1G + ) subpopulations ( Figures 3 G, 3H, and S3 N). Next, we corroborated these observations using flow cytometry that demonstrate that FLMs indeed display the FOLR2 high /CD163 high TAM1-like phenotype ( Figures 3 I, S4 A, and S4 B). Importantly, we detected a significant enrichment of the FOLR2 high macrophage population in FLM and TAM1 when compared to adjacent normal liver ( Figures 3 J and 3K). Altogether these results indicate the specific enrichment of fetal-liver-associated FOLR2 + macrophages in HCC.
Ontogeny of TAMs in human cancer remains an unexplored area. This is partially due to the lack of reliable markers to distinguish tissue-resident versus monocyte-derived macrophages and mostly due to the absence of precise tools. Recently, we have generated the Ms4a3 Cre -Rosa TdT fate-mapping reporter mice ( Liu et al., 2019 24. Liu, Z. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Chakarov, S. ... Fate Mapping via Ms4a3-Expression History Traces Monocyte-Derived Cells Cell. 2019; 178 :1509-1525 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ), which allow us to distinguish between embryonically seeded (Tomato – ) and monocyte-derived macrophages (Tomato + ). To address whether a subset of HCC TAMs undergo fetal-like reprogramming, we performed scRNA-seq on ∼17,000 liver cells from Tomato – , Tomato + , and CD45 – cells from the Ms4a3 Cre -Rosa TdT mice ( Figures S4 C and S4D). Next, we employed machine-learning-based algorithm Garnett ( Pliner et al., 2019 32. Pliner, H.A. ∙ Shendure, J. ∙ Trapnell, C. Supervised classification enables rapid annotation of cell atlases Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :983-986 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform a cross-species comparative analysis of mouse embryonically seeded, human fetal, and TAMs from liver tissues. First, we trained “Garnett classifier” based on the MNPs markers in HCC followed by testing on human fetal and mouse livers from Ms4a3 Cre -Rosa TdT mice ( Figure 4 A). Second, we investigated whether such machine-learning analysis on HCC data could identify a similar cell type in human fetal and mouse liver datasets ( Figure 4 B). As a proof of principle, the machine was able to predict all the cell types in HCC with a very high correlation score ( Figure 4 C). The machine also detected similarity between monocytes and DCs between HCC and human fetal and mouse liver ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Surprisingly, the machine detected very high similarity in gene expression between the HCC-TAM1, human FLM, and the embryonically seeded mouse liver macrophages ( Figures 4 C and 4E).
To confirm these results independently, we profiled two more human fetal-liver tissues (14 and 18 week EGA) and employed Seurat integration ( Stuart et al., 2019 46. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar ) to compile scRNA-seq libraries from 14 HCC and 4 fetal-liver tissues ( Figure S4 E). A total of ∼134,500 single-cell libraries were analyzed and annotated in different cell types ( Figures S4 F–S4J). Next, we sub-clustered the integrated MNP dataset, which resulted in 12 clusters representing DCs, monocytes, and macrophages ( Figure 4 F). Interestingly, after integration, FOLR2 + TAM1 and a subset of FLMs clustered together as cl. 1 ( Figures 4 G–4I). This also suggests that separate FOLR2 + TAM1 clusters observed in aggregated dataset ( Figures 2 F and 3 F) represent distinct cell states (of TAM1), which merged during integration. Importantly, SPP1 + TAM2 forms a separate cluster without any intermixing with FLMs. These results clearly demonstrate that FOLR2 + TAM1s (fetal-like TAMs or F-TAMs) in HCC exhibit remarkable similarity with embryonically seeded macrophages indicating fetal-like reprogramming of TAMs in HCC.
Next, in order to identify the similarities between fetal liver and HCC PLVAP + ECs, we sub-clustered the integrated endothelial dataset into 13 clusters, identifying adjacent normal, tumor, and fetal-specific ECs ( Figures 4 J–4L). Importantly, we observed integration of fetal and tumor ECs in PLVAP + clusters 1 and 5 ( Figure 4 M). Since VEGF signaling is known to play an important role in angiogenesis, we investigated the cell-cell interaction between tumor and ECs. We performed NicheNet ( Browaeys et al., 2019 7. Browaeys, R. ∙ Saelens, W. ∙ Saeys, Y. NicheNet: modeling intercellular communication by linking ligands to target genes Nat. Methods. 2019; 17 :159-162 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ) analysis, which allowed us to predict cellular interactions by linking ligand and target gene expression. Interestingly, NicheNet predicted that hepatocyte-derived VEGFA could activate PLVAP in tumor ECs ( Figure 5 A). It is important to note that a major subset of PLVAP + ECs expresses the receptor for VEGF ( Figures 2 C and 4 L), thereby strongly implying that communication between tumor hepatocytes and ECs leads to PLVAP expression. Importantly, hepatocyte-mediated VEGF signaling regulates EC fenestration during fetal-liver organogenesis ( Carpenter et al., 2005 10. Carpenter, B. ∙ Lin, Y. ∙ Stoll, S. ... VEGF is crucial for the hepatic vascular development required for lipoprotein uptake Development. 2005; 132 :3293-3303 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as angiogenesis in HCC ( Horwitz et al., 2014 19. Horwitz, E. ∙ Stein, I. ∙ Andreozzi, M. ... Human and mouse VEGFA-amplified hepatocellular carcinomas are highly sensitive to sorafenib treatment Cancer Discov. 2014; 4 :730-743 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, it is also known that cellular division induces the VEGF secretion from hepatocytes ( Shimizu et al., 2001 43. Shimizu, H. ∙ Miyazaki, M. ∙ Wakabayashi, Y. ... Vascular endothelial growth factor secreted by replicating hepatocytes induces sinusoidal endothelial cell proliferation during regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats J. Hepatol. 2001; 34 :683-689 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is a direct regulator of PLVAP expression ( Kim et al., 2020 21. Kim, S.A. ∙ Kim, S.J. ∙ Choi, Y.A. ... Retinal VEGFA maintains the ultrastructure and function of choriocapillaris by preserving the endothelial PLVAP Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 522 :240-246 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Strickland et al., 2005 45. Strickland, L.A. ∙ Jubb, A.M. ∙ Hongo, J.-A. ... Plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) is expressed by tumour endothelium and is upregulated by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) J. Pathol. 2005; 206 :466-475 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). We validated these observations by RNA-FISH experiments and observed increased expression of VEGFA, PLVAP, ALB, and CD163 in HCC when compared to adjacent normal tissue ( Figures 5 B and S5 A). Similarly, we also observed higher correlation between VEGFA, VEGFR2, and PLVAP in the same tumor sectors from scRNA-seq data ( Figure S5 C). Taken together, these results suggest the importance of VEGF signaling in the emergence of PLVAP + ECs in fetal liver and HCC and likely promoting onco-fetal reprogramming of TME.
Given our observation of fetal-like EC and macrophages in HCC and immune privileged microenvironment of a developing fetus ( McGovern et al., 2017 26. McGovern, N. ∙ Shin, A. ∙ Low, G. ... Human fetal dendritic cells promote prenatal T-cell immune suppression through arginase-2 Nature. 2017; 546 :662-666 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that FOLR2 + TAMs may participate in orchestrating an immunosuppressive TME. This notion was further supported by the lack of cytotoxic (T/NK/NKT) immune cells and gain of Tregs (CD4 + /TIGIT + /CTLA4 + ) and fetal-like TAM1 (FOLR2 high /CD163 high /CD206 high ) subpopulations in tumors. In order to decipher the receptor-ligand interactions in normal and tumor ecosystem, we performed cell-cell interaction analysis (CellPhoneDB) ( Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 48. Vento-Tormo, R. ∙ Efremova, M. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal-fetal interface in humans Nature. 2018; 563 :347-353 Crossref Scopus (1233) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed 314 interactions in normal and 478 in tumor tissue ( Figures 5 C and S6 A–S6C). Importantly, we detected twice as many interactions between macrophages and other immune (CD4, CD8, NK, and DC) cells in the tumor compared to normal microenvironment. These interactions were specifically associated with immune checkpoint receptor and ligands (CD40LG:CD40, CD28;CD86, SIRPA:CD47, and CD86:CTLA4) between the macrophages and other immune cells in the TME ( Figures 5 D–5F). Notably, recent reports have demonstrated CTLA4-mediated trans-endocytosis of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 from antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thereby inhibiting APCs ability to co-stimulate T cells ( Ovcinnikovs et al., 2019 31. Ovcinnikovs, V. ∙ Ross, E.M. ∙ Petersone, L. ... CTLA-4–mediated transendocytosis of costimulatory molecules primarily targets migratory dendritic cells Sci. Immunol. 2019; 4 :eaaw0902 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, Tregs and macrophages represent the majority of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in our scRNA-seq ( Figures 1 B and 1C). We therefore focused on macrophage-Treg interactions to assess the role of individual TAMs in immunomodulation. The FOLR2 + TAM1 displayed more immunosuppressive interactions with Tregs compared to the SPP1 + TAM2 subpopulation ( Figure 5 G). Notably, TAM1 also expressed higher levels of immunomodulatory chemokines such as CXCL12 and CXCL16 as well as CD86 ( Figure 5 H). Taken together, these results suggest that TAM1 could facilitate the immunosuppressive microenvironment in HCC. Next, we investigated whether Tregs and TAM1 colocalize in the same niche within the tumor ecosystem. Additionally, we also investigated whether fetal-like PLVAP + ECs are also localized in the vicinity of TAM1 and Tregs. Remarkably, we observed that TAM1 (CD163 + ), Tregs (TIGIT + ), and PLVAP + ECs co-localized to the same niche, adjoining the clusters of ALB + tumor epithelial cells ( Figure 5 I). We also observed enrichment of CD163 + and TIGIT + cells in areas with high PLVAP density ( Figures 5 I, S5 B, S5D, and S5E). These results suggest perivascular localization of TAM1 in immune-privileged sites of tumors. In concordance with CellPhoneDB analysis, we observed enrichment of FOLR2 + TAM1 with TIGIT + cells when compared to SPP1 + TAM2 underscoring the primary role of FOLR2 + TAMs in immunosuppressive interactions ( Figures 5 J and S5 F–S5H). Our results further demonstrate the nexus between FOLR2 + TAMs, Tregs, and onco-fetal ECs in the tumor ecosystem.
Our results from the scRNA-seq, machine-learning, and integrative analysis indicated a shared transcriptional program between mouse embryonically seeded, human fetal-liver, and tumor macrophages. We hypothesized that systematic elucidation of GRNs in these cell types could allow us to identify conserved transcription factors that may promote the fetal-like reprogramming of FOLR2 + TAMs. We employed single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) ( Aibar et al., 2017 1. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (2295) PubMed Google Scholar ) to decipher the GRN of mouse and human myeloid cells followed by regulon-activity-based hierarchical clustering. Next, based on similarity in orthologous GRNs, we built a Pearson correlation heatmap of mouse (8,724 cells from Ms4a3 Cre -Rosa TdT ) and human (9,307 cells from fetal, normal, and tumor) myeloid cells ( Figure 6 A). We observed cross-species conserved regulons in mouse embryonically seeded, human fetal-liver, and HCC TAM1 macrophages. We also observed distinct clusters of mouse Tomato + monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Interestingly, TAM2 and TAM3 population formed an intermixed group close to mouse Tomato + monocyte-derived cluster, while clustering away from embryonically seeded, fetal-liver, and TAM1 macrophages ( Figure 6 A). Next, we sought to identify a conserved set of GRNs modules specific to each myeloid cell type. Based on SCENIC data, we identified 128 orthologous GRNs that grouped into 7 major modules across mouse and human myeloid cells. This allowed us to delineate the conserved lineage-specific modules that may lead to the establishment of a fetal-like transcription program ( Figure 6 B). We identified a conserved module (HES1, SPIC, NR1H3, MAF, etc.) across mouse embryonically seeded, fetal-liver, and TAM1 macrophages. We also identified other modules (RXRA, KLF3), which are conserved among mouse liver embryonically seeded and human fetal-liver macrophages but are absent from HCC-TAM1s. We specifically observed the activation of module-2-associated TFs HES1 and NR1H3 in fetal-liver and TAM1 macrophages while being relatively absent in SPP1 + TAM2 cluster ( Figure 6 C). Shared GRN analysis, in concordance with integration analysis indicated that the distinct FOLR2 + TAM clusters ( Figures 2 F and 3 F), may represent cell states (monocyte-derived reprogrammed and TRMs) rather than cell types, thereby suggesting the onco-fetal reprogramming of TAMs in HCC.
Since TAM1 macrophages co-localized with PLVAP + ECs in the TME ( Figure 5 I) and HES1 is one of the classic downstream effectors of juxtacrine Notch signaling pathway ( Sharma et al., 2012 41. Sharma, A. ∙ Paranjape, A.N. ∙ Rangarajan, A. ... A monoclonal antibody against human Notch1 ligand-binding domain depletes subpopulation of putative breast cancer stem-like cells Mol. Cancer Ther. 2012; 11 :77-86 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that PLVAP + ECs may facilitate the activation of Notch signaling in TAM1 and thereby promoting onco-fetal reprogramming. First, we investigated the expression of Notch receptors and ligands in HCC atlas. We observed the receptor (NOTCH2) expression in myeloid cells and ligand (DLL4) expression by the PLVAP + onco-fetal ECs (S6D). Importantly, as shown in Figure 2 L, HES1 expression was specifically upregulated in monocyte-derived TAM1 subset. By employing RNA-FISH assay, we detected FOLR2 + /HES1 + TAM1 juxtaposed to PLVAP + /DLL4 + ECs ( Figure 6 D). In concordance with scRNA-seq data, we observed a subset of FOLR2 + cells were HES1 + ( Figure 6 E). Our RNA velocity analysis predicted the monocytic origin of fetal-like FOLR2 + /HES1 + macrophages ( Figure 2 K). On the other hand, most of PLVAP + EC’s also displayed DLL4 + expression ( Figure 6 F), suggesting these onco-fetal ECs may serve as the potential source of the ligand for Notch activation in the NOTCH2-expressing TAM1 macrophages.
Multiple lines of investigations including RNA velocity, GRN, and imaging analyses indicated the importance of HES1 in onco-fetal reprogramming of TAM1. We next employed in vitro assays to investigate whether the PLVAP + /DLL4 + TME can reprogram normal monocyte/macrophage populations into fetal-like TAMs. This was performed by co-culturing normal CD14 + monocytes with DLL4-ligand-coated beads in the presence and absence of anti-DLL4 blocking antibody. Notably, co-culturing adjacent normal CD14 + cells with DLL4 ligand led to the gain of the TAM1 (CD163 + /CD206 + ) phenotype, while the addition of anti-DLL4 antibody blocked this reprogramming ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and S6 E). These results further corroborate the hypothesis that activation of Notch signaling can promote the microenvironment-mediated onco-fetal reprogramming of TAMs.
Altogether our results suggest the VEGF-mediated induction of PLVAP + ECs and DLL4 + -mediated reprogramming of FOLR2 + TAM1s. We also observed co-localization of FOLR2 + , PLVAP + , and TIGIT + cells in HCC TME, suggesting the existence of an immunosuppressive niche. In order to systematically comprehend the extent of similarity between tumor and fetal ecosystem, we performed spatial transcriptomics assay ( Figure 7 C). We employed 96 immune, stromal, epithelial, and onco-fetal markers to profile three human fetal-liver, adjacent normal, and tumor tissues. In total, we profiled 108 regions from 9 slides followed by hierarchical clustering of highly variable genes. Interestingly, we observed that majority of tumor and fetal-liver sectors clustered together ( Figures 7 D and 7E; Table S5 ) and exhibited the classic hallmarks of immunosuppressive (FOXP3, CTLA4, LAG3, BATF3) T cells and onco-fetal ecosystem, i.e., FOLR2 + macrophages, PLVAP + ECs, and Notch/VEGF receptor ligands. However, cluster 2 consisted of mostly adjacent normal tissue with some fetal and tumor sectors. Moreover, the cluster also displayed lower expression of markers associated with onco-fetal ecosystem, immunosuppressive T cells, and NOTCH/VEGF signaling. To explore the implication of fetal-like reprogramming beyond cancer, we performed partial liver hepatectomy in Ms4a3 Cre -Rosa TdT mice and analyzed ∼79,000 single cells from regenerating mouse liver at days 0, 7, 14, and 28 ( Figures S7 A–S7E). Interestingly, we observed an increase in FOLR2 + monocyte-derived (Tomato + ) macrophages at days 7–28 ( Figure S7 F). Moreover, we also observed a concomitant increase in the PLVAP expression, components of Notch and VEGF pathway, as well as genes associated with immunosuppressive T cells during liver regeneration ( Figure S7 G). These results indicate the resurgence of a fetal-like ecosystem during liver regeneration similar to what we observed during human fetal-liver development and in HCC microenvironment.

Section: Discussion

Tumorigenesis is a multistep process where, after the initial bottleneck of oncogenic transformation of a founder cell, its eventual survival relies on its ability to colonize favorable habitats ( Burrell et al., 2013 9. Burrell, R.A. ∙ McGranahan, N. ∙ Bartek, J. ... The causes and consequences of genetic heterogeneity in cancer evolution Nature. 2013; 501 nature12625 Crossref Scopus (1653) PubMed Google Scholar ; McGranahan and Swanton, 2017 27. McGranahan, N. ∙ Swanton, C. Clonal Heterogeneity and Tumor Evolution: Past, Present, and the Future Cell. 2017; 168 :613-628 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1711) PubMed Google Scholar ). An ambient tumor ecosystem not only fuels the growth of cancer cells but also provides them with a safe niche to overcome the immune system. Recently, it was reported that pediatric renal cell carcinoma exhibit features of aberrant fetal cells with faulty WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) expression ( Young et al., 2018 53. Young, M.D. ∙ Mitchell, T.J. ∙ Vieira Braga, F.A. ... Single-cell transcriptomes from human kidneys reveal the cellular identity of renal tumors Science. 2018; 361 :594-599 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar ) during adult homeostasis, re-emphasizing the link between developmental anomalies and tumors. However, a comparative analysis between tumor and fetal microenvironment to investigate whether the tumor ecosystem recapitulates fetal-like properties remains to be investigated. Here, we generated a comprehensive, single-cell atlas of the human liver to understand the cellular landscape from fetal development to cancer. We surveyed ∼212,000 human and mouse liver cells through the course of early development to terminal disease. We identified shared cell types, transcriptional programs, GRNs, and signaling pathways between fetal-liver and tumor microenvironment, indicating the onco-fetal reprogramming of ecosystem in HCC. These results provide unprecedented insights into the shared programs between growing fetal-liver and HCC ecosystem.
In order to understand the cellular landscape of the human liver and its implications in cancer, we first focused on the cell types specifically enriched in tumor tissues. This led to the identification of PLVAP + ECs that were predominantly present in HCC, as compared to the adjacent normal. Interestingly, PLVAP is known to regulate the endothelial permeability and entry of antigens into the lymph nodes ( Rantakari et al., 2015 37. Rantakari, P. ∙ Auvinen, K. ∙ Jäppinen, N. ... The endothelial protein PLVAP in lymphatics controls the entry of lymphocytes and antigens into lymph nodes Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16 ni.3101 Google Scholar ). Importantly, PLVAP plays a crucial role in the seeding of TRMs during murine fetal-liver development ( Rantakari et al., 2016 38. Rantakari, P. ∙ Jäppinen, N. ∙ Lokka, E. ... Fetal liver endothelium regulates the seeding of tissue-resident macrophages Nature. 2016; 538 :392-396 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the reports of PLVAP + ECs in mouse fetal liver, we first investigated whether PLVAP + ECs are also present in human fetal liver. Indeed, we detected PLVAP + cells in human fetal-liver tissues. Notably, tumor adjacent normal liver tissues lacked PLVAP + ECs indicating fetal-like reprogramming of ECs in HCC. While this work was in review, PLVAP + ECs were also reported in cirrhotic but not in healthy liver ( Ramachandran et al., 2019 36. Ramachandran, P. ∙ Dobie, R. ∙ Wilson-Kanamori, J.R. ... Resolving the fibrotic niche of human liver cirrhosis at single-cell level Nature. 2019; 575 :512-518 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar ). We employed the machine-learning approach Garnett to compare HCC atlas with cirrhotic liver and observed strong transcriptional similarities between HCC and cirrhotic liver PLVAP + cells ( Figures S7 H–S7J). Our NicheNet analysis also indicated the role of hepatocyte-driven VEGFA in inducing PLVAP expression in ECs. Given the importance of hepatocyte-mediated VEGFA in fetal-liver organogenesis and regeneration, it is tempting to speculate that re-emergence of fetal-like PLVAP + ECs in liver may have a role beyond carcinogenesis that requires further investigations.
Next, we investigated the implication of these fetal-like ECs in the tumor ecosystem. Given the importance of PLVAP + ECs in chemoattracting TRMs during mouse fetal-liver development, we investigated whether TAMs also exhibit FLM characteristics. We identified three subpopulations of TAMs (FOLR2 + , SPP1 + , and MT1G + ) in HCC, of which the FOLR2 + TAMs shared significant transcriptomic signatures with human FLMs. Further, RNA velocity analysis revealed the dichotomy in FOLR2 + TAM1s where a subset appears to be tissue resident while another may be monocyte derived. We also compared the transcriptional profile of FOLR2 + TAM1 with Ms4a3 Cre -Rosa TdT mouse embryonically seeded and human fetal-liver macrophages and observed a strong correlation among these cell types. These results not only establish the embryonic nature of FOLR2 + TAM1 but also support the onco-fetal reprogramming of TME in HCC. Based on comparative analysis, we observed remarkable cross-species conservation of transcription factors, and we specifically observed the conservation of HES1 and NR1H3 transcription factors in FOLR2 + macrophages across mouse embryonically seeded, fetal-liver, and TAM1 macrophages. Recently, two different studies on mice liver niche ( Bonnardel et al., 2019 6. Bonnardel, J. ∙ T’Jonck, W. ∙ Gaublomme, D. ... Stellate cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells imprint the kupffer cell identity on monocytes colonizing the liver macrophage niche Immunity. 2019; 51 :638-654 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sakai et al., 2019 40. Sakai, M. ∙ Troutman, T.D. ∙ Seidman, J.S. ... Liver-derived signals sequentially reprogram myeloid enhancers to initiate and maintain Kupffer cell identity Immunity. 2019; 51 :655-670 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ) demonstrated the implication of DLL4-NOTCH-mediated reprogramming of monocytes to Kupffer cell-like phenotype, indicating the importance of NOTCH signaling in liver TRMs. Since liver is the primary organ for folate storage and metabolism, the elevated expression of FOLR2 by fetal and tumor macrophages warrants further investigation into TAM1’s role in folate metabolism during tumorigenesis. Apart from TAM1, we also identified SPP1-expressing TAM2 subpopulations in HCC. Interestingly, SPP1 + macrophages have recently been associated with lipid-laden tissues and named as lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) ( Jaitin et al., 2019 20. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Adlung, L. ∙ Thaiss, C.A. ... Lipid-Associated Macrophages Control Metabolic Homeostasis in a Trem2-Dependent Manner Cell. 2019; 178 :686-698 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (618) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with recently identified niche-dependent phenotypes and functional programming of TRMs ( Chakarov et al., 2019 12. Chakarov, S. ∙ Lim, H.Y. ∙ Tan, L. ... Two distinct interstitial macrophage populations coexist across tissues in specific subtissular niches Science. 2019; 363 :eaau0964 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results provide novel insights into macrophage heterogeneity and function in hepatic tumors.
The developing fetus displays a tolerogenic immune response, steadily maintained by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which gradually declines after birth ( McGovern et al., 2017 26. McGovern, N. ∙ Shin, A. ∙ Low, G. ... Human fetal dendritic cells promote prenatal T-cell immune suppression through arginase-2 Nature. 2017; 546 :662-666 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, tumors also cultivate a suppressive immune system as demonstrated by enrichment of Tregs and exhausted CD8 + T cells. Indeed, in our scRNA-seq analysis, we also detected specific enrichment of Tregs and exclusion of cytotoxic immune (CD8, NKT, and NK) cells in HCC. Discovery of onco-fetal PLVAP + ECs and FOLR2 + TAM1 further motivated us to decipher the role of these cells in the modulation of TME. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed a significant increase in immunosuppressive interactions between macrophage and T cell population in HCC. Interestingly, among the three subpopulations of TAMs, the FOLR2 + TAM1 was specifically engaged in immune-suppressive interactions with Tregs as compared to SPP1 + TAM2. We further showed that PLVAP + ECs and FOLR2 + TAM1 co-localize with Tregs in tumors, indicating the role of onco-fetal reprogramming in mobilizing the immunosuppressive TME. These observations were also validated by employing a larger panel of immune-oncology markers in spatial transcriptomics assay. We demonstrated the shared immune and stromal microenvironment between fetal liver and HCC. We also observed the higher expression of NOTCH and VEGF signaling components in microenvironment enriched with FOLR2 + macrophages, PLVAP + ECs, and immunosuppressive T cells, suggesting the importance of VEGF and NOTCH signaling in maintenance of onco-fetal ecosystem. In light of immunosuppressive onco-fetal TME and implication of immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of advanced stage HCC ( Okusaka and Ikeda, 2018 30. Okusaka, T. ∙ Ikeda, M. Immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: current status and future perspectives ESMO Open. 2018; 3 :e000455 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), it will be interesting to investigate whether our spatial transcriptomics panel could guide the therapeutic stratification for checkpoint inhibitors.
Taken together, our study reports the shared cell types, transcriptional program, and signaling components between human fetal liver and HCC. These results suggest the role of VEGF/NOTCH signaling in maintaining an immunosuppressive onco-fetal ecosystem in HCC. These findings are particularly interesting in light of a recent IMBrave150 HCC clinical trial ( Cheng et al., 2019 13. Cheng, A.L. ∙ Qin, S. ∙ Ikeda, M. ... IMbrave150: Efficacy and safety results from a ph III study evaluating atezolizumab (atezo) + bevacizumab (bev) vs sorafenib (Sor) as first treatment (tx) for patients (pts) with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Ann. Oncol. 2019; 30 :9 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ), which reports improved outcomes with combinatorial therapy of VEGF and checkpoint inhibitors in comparison to Sorafenib monotherapy. We therefore conclude that the concept of VEGF/NOTCH-mediated immunosuppressive onco-fetal ecosystem not only provides a novel target for therapeutic interventions but could also serve as a potential biomarker for the stratification of HCC patients slated for immunotherapy. Our discovery of onco-fetal reprogramming in HCC also opens up avenues for identification and understanding of similar paradigms in other cancers.

The adjacent normal and tumor (HCC) tissues were obtained from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and National University (NUH) with written consent and approval from Central Institution Review Board of SingHealth (CIRB 2012/669/B). The samples were delivered in with MACS Tissue Storage Solution (Miltenyi, Cat#:130-100-008).
The donation of fetal liver tissues for research was approved by the Centralised Institutional Research Board of the Singapore Health Services in Singapore followed by proper international ethical guidelines and in accordance with a favorable ethical opinion from Singapore SingHealth and National Health Care Group Research Ethics Committees. Women gave written informed consent for the donation of fetal tissue to research nurses who were not directly involved in the research, or in the clinical treatments of women participating in the study, as per the Polkinghorne guidelines ( Polkinghorne, 1989 33. Polkinghorne, J.C. Review of the Guidance on the Research Use of Fetuses and Fetal Material. Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1989 Google Scholar ). This protocol was reviewed on an annual basis by the Centralised Institutional Research Board, including annual monitoring of any adverse events, for which there had been none. All fetal liver tissues were obtained from 2 nd trimester (14,16,18,21 weeks EGA) elective pregnancy terminations carried out for socio-psychological reasons. All fetuses were considered structurally normal on ultrasound examination prior to termination and by gross morphological examination following termination. In total, 4 fetuses of 14,16,18 and 21 weeks EGA were used for this study.
Ms4a3cre-RosaTdt mouse model was kindly provided by Dr. Florent Ginhoux’s lab. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The CD45 depletion was done to obtain CD45 + and CD45 - cells from human HCC or adjancent normal tissues. Next, the CD14 + cells were enriched from CD45 + cells using CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi, Cat#: 130-050-201). DLL4 (R&D systems, Cat#: 1506-D4-050) used in this experiment was reconstituted with 250μl sterile PBS. 20μl of Ni-NTA beads (QIAGEN, Cat#: 30230) was pre-incubated with 50μl reconstituted DLL4 (for DLL4 beads) and 50μl nuclease free water (for nude beads) for 2 hours in a rotator in cold room. Cell culture media (10% Human Serum, 1% glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% pen-strep antibiotic in IMDM media) was used for the cells. In a 12 well plate, the CD14 + /CD45 + cells for adjacent normal tissues were cultured either with nude beads or DLL4 coated beads in the presence or absence of anti-DLL4 antibody (R&D,Cat# MAB1506) and FACS analysis was performed the following day to quantify CD163/CD206 double positive cells.
Tissue was transferred to a sterile 10mm 2 tissue culture dish and cut into very small fragments. The dissociation buffer consisted of 0.43mg/ml of Collagenase IV (GIBCO, Cat#: 17104019) and 0.172mg/μl of DNase1 (Worthington, Cat#: LS002147) dissolved in PBS (GIBCO, Cat#: 20012-043) in RPMI media (GIBCO, Cat#: 22400071). The tissue was digested in dissociation buffer for 30-40 minutes depending on sample size at 37°C with constant shaking at 220rpm while keeping the falcon tube in a slanted position. The solution was re-suspended with 10ml pipette followed by 18-gauge needle. Buffer 1 (1% BSA PBS solution with 1mM EDTA) was added to the digested tissue and then the solution was passed through a 70um filter before centrifuging at 800 g for 6 minutes at 4°C. Cells were treated with 5ml of 1X RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend, Cat#: 420301) on ice for 10-15 minutes. Buffer 1 was then added and the cells were passed through 40um filter. Cells were dissolved in Buffer 2 (1% BSA PBS solution) prior to counting.
Dead cell removal was done using dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi, Cat#: 130-090-101) to improve the viability of the sample. 100μl per 10 7 total cells was added to the cell pellet and incubated for 15 minutes on room temperature. MACS buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA and 2mM EDTA) along with QuadroMACS separator (Miltenyi, Cat# 130-090-976) and LS columns (Miltenyi, Cat#: 130-042-401) was used. Prior to adding the cells, the column was washed with 2ml of MACS buffer. The cells were then passed through the column and the column was washed again with 2ml MACS buffer. The cell pellet was then obtained after centrifuging at 800 g for 6 minutes at 4°C. For enriching CD45 + cells, CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi, Cat#: 130-045-801) was used. 40μl per 10 7 total cells of CD45 MicroBeads was added to the pellet and incubated for 15 minutes in ice. After incubation, CD45 + and CD45 - cells were collected after the cells passed through the column. The CD45 + and CD45 - cell pellet was then obtained after centrifuging at 800 g for 6 minutes at 4°C. Samples were processed using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ (v2 Chemistry) platform with the target of ∼6,000 cells (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). Briefly, cells were added onto a chip to form Gel Bead-in-Emulsion (GEMs) in the Chromium instrument followed by cell lysis, barcoding, fragmentation, adaptor ligation and addition of sample index to the libraries before sequencing.
Mouse experiments and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Biological Resource Center (Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore) in accordance with the guidelines of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority and the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research of Singapore (ICUAC No. 181402). The Ms4a3cre-RosaTdt mice have been described elsewhere ( Liu et al., 2019 24. Liu, Z. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Chakarov, S. ... Fate Mapping via Ms4a3-Expression History Traces Monocyte-Derived Cells Cell. 2019; 178 :1509-1525 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ). All mice were bred and housed in the Singapore Immunology Network animal facility under Specific Pathogen-Free conditions. Mice were used between 7 and 12 week-old age. Partial hepatectomy consisted of a midline laparotomy with removal of the left liver lobe under general anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine). Mice rapidly regained consciousness and had immediate access to food and water. They were then euthanized at indicated times by CO 2 inhalation. Samples were processed using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ (v3 Chemistry) platform with the target of ∼6000 cells (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). Sequencing was done on Novaseq lanes by NovageneAIT.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded slides were obtained from Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Tissue sections were mounted on glass slides and stored at room temperature. Slides were stained using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 Assay Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) using manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the slides were baked at 60°C for 1 hour. The slides were then deparaffinized and dehydrated using fresh xylene and fresh 100% ethanol. The deparaffinized slides were treated to RNAscope® Hydrogen Peroxide for 10 minutes at room temperature. For target retrieval, the slides were placed in a slide holder with 200 mL of RNAscope® 1X Target Retrieval Reagent at 99°C for 15 minutes. After the slides were cooled down, a hydrophobic barrier was drawn around the tissue with the ImmEdge hydrophobic barrier pen. RNAscope® Protease Plus was added onto the tissue slide for 30 minutes at 40°C. RNAscope probes from ACDBio were used in this experiment; PLVAP (Cat#: 437461), CD163 (Cat#: 41706), ALB (Cat#: 600941), TIGIT (Cat#: 319791), VEGFA (Cat# 423161), FOLR2 (Cat#: 479871), SPP1 (Cat#: 420101), DLL4 (Cat#: 603001), HES1 (Cat#: 311191). Probe hybridization was done for 2 hours at 40°C. The amplification steps were performed the next day following the protocol. 1:500 dilution of Opal dyes (Perkin Elmer, Cat# NEL821001KT) was used for fluorescence. The slides were mounted using ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermofisher, Cat#: P36970). The slides were kept at room temperature overnight in the dark to set and imaged using Vectra Polaris (Perkin Elmer). For image quantification, ImageJ and Cell Profiler were used. First, images were split into single channel greyscale images using ImageJ software. Then, these single channel greyscale images were put into Cell Profiler software and analyzed using a published pipeline ( Erben et al., 2018 17. Erben, L. ∙ He, M.-X. ∙ Laeremans, A. ... A Novel Ultrasensitive In Situ Hybridization Approach to Detect Short Sequences and Splice Variants with Cellular Resolution Mol. Neurobiol. 2018; 55 :6169-6181 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) was done using NanoString. It is a highly multiplexed assay which allows characterization of mRNA or proteins. For this assay, FFPE slides from three HCC patients and three fetal samples were used. A total of 96 targets were selected for this experiment. First, the slides were stained with KRT (epithelial cell marker), CD45 (immune cell marker) and CD31 (endothelial cell marker) for ROI selection. 12 ROI’s per slide were selected with the size of 500 μm each.
When libraries were sent for sequencing, a quality control step of sizing and concentration was performed using Agilent BioAnalyzer and quantification PCR. Next, using cBOT machine, reads were amplified on Flowcell. Sequencing was done using a HiSeq4000 system where the bcl files were generated. Subsequently, these bcl files were used as an input to CellRanger mkfastq for trimming, base calling and demultiplexing of reads. Sequenced fastq files were aligned, filtered, barcoded and UMI counted using Cell Ranger Chromium Single Cell RNA-seq version 2.0.2, by 10X Genomics with Cell Ranger, GRCh38 database (version 1.2.0) as the human genome reference. All 62 sectors are aggregated using cellranger aggr by normalizing all runs to the same sequencing depth.
Downstream analysis was done using Scanpy, a scalable Python-based package (version 1.4) designed for single cell gene expression datasets. Scanpy implements numerous functions from preprocessing to visualization, clustering, differential gene expression, and trajectory inference analysis on Jupyter Notebooks. Parameters used in each function were manually curated to portray the best clustering of cells. In preprocessing, cells are filtered based on the criteria of expressing a minimum of 200 genes and a gene which is expressed by a minimum of 30 cells. Dying cells with a mitochondrial percentage of more than 5% were excluded. Cell count was normalized using scanpy.api.pp.normalize_per_cell with a scaling factor of 10,000 whereas gene expression was scaled to unit variance and mean value of 0 using scanpy.api.pp.scale .
Dimension reduction starts with PCA using scanpy.api.tl.pca ; the number of PCs used in each clustering exercise varies depending on the importance of embeddings to be included. In the interest of crisp clustering, we first calculated neighborhood graph ( scanpy.api.pp.neighbors ) of cells. Best matched k-Nearest Neighbor is automatically weighted by the algorithm to compute the best UMAP topology ( scanpy.api.tl.umap , minimum distance between 0.3 to 0.5) which is consistently used throughout this paper. The Louvain method ( scanpy.api.tl.louvain ) is then used to detect a community of similar cells. By default, Louvain’s resolution parameter is set to the maximum value of 1.0, this in theory finds more and smaller clusters. In our experiments, the value is set in the range of 0.6 to 1. Genes are then ranked using scanpy.api.tl.rank_genes_groups (Benjamini Hochberg, t test overestimated variance with adjusted p value). Cell types was manually and iteratively assigned based on overlaps of literature curated and statistically ranked genes. To leverage the heterogeneity of this dataset, we used partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA, scanpy.api.tl.paga ) to reconstruct lineage between cell types. This lineage trajectory provides a continuous cell type transition from the assigned discrete cell types. The thickness of the edges represents connectivity scores, an entropy-based measure provided by PAGA indicating relatedness between clusters; spurious connections are discarded while tuning thresholds.
Garnett ( https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/garnett/ ) is an automated celltype classification software. The regression-based machine learning classifier was trained to recognize cell type specific gene expression pattern formatted in a text (.txt) file. Using check_markers() and human database ( org.Hs.eg.db ), the ambiguity of cell types specific markers formatted in the text file was assessed and plotted using plot_markers() ; marker genes that were marked overlapped with other cell types or are ranked with high ambiguity score are excluded in the analysis. Garnett’s train_cell_classifier() was used to learn the expression pattern. Raw counts and all available genes obtained from cellranger count was utilized. The number of unknown cells allowed in a cluster was set to 50 and at least a minimum of 8 cells are expressing the set of genes in a cell type. While classifying cells using classify_cells() , parameter rank_prob_ratio was set between 1.2-1.8. cluster_ext_type labels generated are used to plot heatmaps using pheatmap() to determine the accuracy of the classifiers.
To identify cell type specific gene regulatory networks, S ingle C ell R e gulatory N etwork I nference and C lustering, (SCENIC) ( https://aertslab.org/#scenic ) was performed on myeloid and control mouse dataset. SCENIC is a combination of 3 packages (GENIE3, RcisTarget and AUCell). First, we filtered for genes expressed in 3% of samples and cells that are expressing > 0 UMI and normalized by log2(filteredexpr+1). Filtering criteria was less stringent to prevent exclusion of rare cell types. Genes that are available in RcisTarget’s human and mouse feather databases ( hg19-500bp-upstream-7species.mc9nr.feather, hg19-tss-centered-10kb-7species.mc9nr.feather, mm9-500bp-upstream-7species.mc9nr.feather, mm9-tss-centered-10kb-7species.mc9nr.feather ) are utilized. These genes are found in a region of 500 to 10,000 base pairs upstream in the hg19 human reference genome. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted between human myeloid population and mouse Tomato + and Tomato - population using cor() from stats v3.6.2 in RDocumentation( https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/cor ).
For the cell to cell interaction study, ligand and receptor information are retrieved from CellPhoneDB ( https://www.cellphonedb.org ) repository. This package searches for a ligand-receptor interaction and outputs multiple result files based on curated databases such as UniProt, IUPHAR, and Ensembl. log10 of p values and log2 mean expression was calculated and expressed on dotplots. Dotplots are generated using python’s pyplot.scatter from matplotlib library ( https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html ). Circle plots depicting the amount of interactions between cell types are drawn using R’s chordDiagram() from circilize package ( https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/circlize/versions/0.4.8 ). NicheNet ( https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr ) is utilized to deeper understand cell to cell interaction. This analysis includes large amount of public database (KEGG, ENCODE, PhoshoSite) to track downstream effectors such as transcription factors and receptor’s target in the provided dataset. Three matrices are provided namely “ligand-target prior model,” “ligand-receptor network” and “weighted integrated networks.” Using our cell type labeled whole atlas Seurat object, receiver cell type is specified as endothelial population sender cell type as hepatocyte population whereas condition of interest is ‘Tumor’ as compared to ‘Normal’ region in nichenet_seuratobj_aggregate() . Nichenet heatmap can be plotted using nichenet_output$ligand_activity_target_heatmap. Nichenet tutorials are found in the GitHub page.
Data received from NanoString Technologies ( https://www.nanostring.com/ ) includes ERCC normalized data (Raw data), Signal-to-Noise (SNR) Normalized data, Area Normalized data, and Housekeeper Normalized data. This dataset includes six individuals sampled across 12 sectors for 96 genes. Highly variable genes are selected through principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is calculated using prcomp() in R. pheatmap function is used to plot and cluster gene expressions. Function hclust() is used to cluster cells and plot dendrograms. Specifically, eight genes are plotted on a stack barplot using ggplot2 package in R to summarize the heatmap.
Proportion bar plots are used to depict the quantitative measure of cells from different conditions after normalization. Stack bar plots are constructed both on R and python platform using plot() in R and pandas.plot.barh in python. Number of cells from each condition are divided by number of cells from the cluster or cell type followed by calculating for percentage distribution of each condition. These results are plotted as a proportion bar plot.a
For flow cytometry data, marker expression values were transformed using the auto-logicle transformation function from the flowCore R package. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was carried out using all markers included in the flow cytometry panel (see Key Resources Table ). UMAP version 2.4.0 was implemented in Python but executed through the reticulate R package to interface R objects with Python. UMAP was performed using 15 nearest neighbors ( nn ), a min_dist of 0.1 to 0.3 and euclidean distance ( Becht et al., 2018 3. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37 :38-44 Crossref Scopus (2405) Google Scholar ; Mclnnes et al., 2018 28. Mclnnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: uniform manifold approximation and projection arXiv. 2018; 1802.03426 https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426 Google Scholar ). The results obtained from the UMAP analyses were incorporated as additional parameters and converted to .fcs files, which were then loaded into FlowJo to generate heatmaps of marker expression on the reduced dimensions and flow cytometry gating and data visualization analyses.
Using our previously aligned bam files from cellranger, we first sorted by cell-barcode using samtools sort. To annotate spliced and unspliced reads, we used the Velocyto pipeline ( La Manno et al., 2018 22. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1812) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate our loom files. Our steady-state gene-specific velocities was computed and pre-processed following the scVelo python package ( Bergen et al., 2019 5. Bergen, V. ∙ Lange, M. ∙ Peidli, S. ... Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We visualized the endothelial and myeloid populations on velocity streamplots and plotted various individual gene velocities.
The mAbs used for flow cytometry are listed in the STAR METHODS key resources table. Briefly, 5 × 10 6 cells/tube were washed and incubated with Live/Dead blue dye (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 ̊C in PBS and then incubated in 5% heat-inactivated FCS for 15 min at 4 ̊C (Sigma Aldrich). The appropriate antibodies diluted in PBS with 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA were added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at 4 ̊C, and then washed and detected with the secondary reagents. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACSFortessa (BD Biosciences) and the data were analyzed using BD FACSDiva 6.0 (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo v.10.5.3 (Tree Star Inc.). In Figure S7 , contour plots showing the expression of selected genes were obtained using the SecGec software (Flow Jo LLC).
The statistical analysis were performed using the statistical software in R, Python and Prism 7 (GraphPad). The details of significance computed and the test is specified in the figure legends. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
