Title: Top-Down Control of Sweet and Bitter Taste in the Mammalian Brain


Abstract: Summary

Hardwired circuits encoding innate responses have emerged as an essential feature of the mammalian brain. Sweet and bitter evoke opposing predetermined behaviors. Sweet drives appetitive responses and consumption of energy-rich food sources, whereas bitter prevents ingestion of toxic chemicals. Here we identified and characterized the neurons in the brainstem that transmit sweet and bitter signals from the tongue to the cortex. Next we examined how the brain modulates this hardwired circuit to control taste behaviors. We dissect the basis for bitter-evoked suppression of sweet taste and show that the taste cortex and amygdala exert strong positive and negative feedback onto incoming bitter and sweet signals in the brainstem. Finally we demonstrate that blocking the feedback markedly alters responses to ethologically relevant taste stimuli. These results illustrate how hardwired circuits can be finely regulated by top-down control and reveal the neural basis of an indispensable behavioral response for all animals.

Section: Introduction

Hardwired neural circuits participate in a broad range of behaviors, including responses to external chemosensory cues ( Root et al., 2014 42. Root, C.M. ∙ Denny, C.A. ∙ Hen, R. ...

Zimmerman, C.A. ∙ Leib, D.E. ∙ Knight, Z.A. Neural circuits underlying thirst and fluid homeostasis Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18 :459-469 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mammalian taste system is a prominent example of a major sensory system hardwired to trigger predetermined actions and behaviors, such as our innate attraction and consumption of sweet compounds and aversion to bitters ( Scott, 2005 46. Scott, K. Taste recognition: food for thought Neuron. 2005; 48 :455-464 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yarmolinsky et al., 2009 63.

Sweet and bitter chemicals are first recognized by dedicated taste receptor cells (TRCs) on the tongue and palate epithelium. The activated TRCs then transfer their signals through 4 additional neuronal stations to ultimately reach the taste cortex ( Spector and Travers, 2005 49. Spector, A.C. ∙ Travers, S.P. The representation of taste quality in the mammalian nervous system Behav. Cogn. Neurosci. Rev. 2005; 4 :143-191 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yarmolinsky et al., 2009 63.

Common sense about taste: from mammals to insects Cell. 2009; 139 :234-244 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ); first from TRCs to matching ganglion neurons (i.e., sweet TRCs to sweet neurons and bitter TRCs to bitter neurons). These signals then enter the brain by synapsing with targets in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) of the brainstem. Thereafter, information travels to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), the thalamus, and finally the taste cortex, where sweet and bitter tastes are represented by separate populations of cortical neurons ( Chen et al., 2011 8. Chen, X. ∙ Gabitto, M. ∙ Peng, Y. ... A gustotopic map of taste qualities in the mammalian brain Science. 2011; 333 :1262-1266 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A fundamental question about innate behaviors is how they are regulated. The demonstration that a neural circuit operates via labeled lines wired to trigger stereotypic, innate behaviors does not imply that it is not subjected to modulation or plasticity; it means that these circuits evoke predetermined responses requiring no prior learning or experience ( Scott, 2005 46. Scott, K. Taste recognition: food for thought Neuron. 2005; 48 :455-464 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yarmolinsky et al., 2009 63.

Here we show how circuits guiding responses to the two most salient taste qualities, bitter and sweet, are critically modulated by top-down control.

Section: Results

It is well recognized that the evolution of bitter taste receptors reflected the need to detect and prevent ingestion of harmful chemicals ( Antinucci and Risso, 2017 2. Antinucci, M. ∙ Risso, D. A Matter of Taste: Lineage-Specific Loss of Function of Taste Receptor Genes in Vertebrates Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 :81 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dong et al., 2009 12. Dong, D. ∙ Jones, G. ∙ Zhang, S. Dynamic evolution of bitter taste receptor genes in vertebrates BMC Evol. Biol. 2009; 9 :12 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nei et al., 2008 34. Nei, M. ∙ Niimura, Y. ∙ Nozawa, M. The evolution of animal chemosensory receptor gene repertoires: roles of chance and necessity Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9 :951-963 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ). But how does the brain ensure behavioral rejection of a bitter tastant in the presence of an appealing sweet stimulus ( Figures 1 A and S1 A)? At the level of peripheral taste circuits (i.e., TRCs and ganglion neurons), the neural responses to mixtures of sweet and bitter exhibit no significant cross-modulation ( Barretto et al., 2015 4. Barretto, R.P. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Chandrashekar, J. ... The neural representation of taste quality at the periphery Nature. 2015; 517 :373-376 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, to uncover targets for potential bitter-evoked modulation of sweet taste in the brain, we labeled neurons in the bitter cortical field (an area of the taste cortex preferentially responsive to bitter stimuli, hereafter referred to as GCbt) ( Chen et al., 2011 8. Chen, X. ∙ Gabitto, M. ∙ Peng, Y. ... A gustotopic map of taste qualities in the mammalian brain Science. 2011; 333 :1262-1266 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peng et al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in the central amygdala (CeA) with different fluorescent tracers and examined their projections by whole-brain clearing and rapid 3D imaging with light-sheet fluorescent microscopy using clear, unobstructed brain imaging and computational analysis (CUBIC) ( Susaki et al., 2014 50.

Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ... The coding of valence and identity in the mammalian taste system Nature. 2018; 558 :127-131 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). We chose these two brain areas because the taste cortex and the amygdala are key neural substrates encoding the identity and the valence of a taste stimulus (i.e., “what is it?” and “is it good or bad?”) ( Wang et al., 2018 56. Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ...

Our results ( Figures 1 B–1D and S1 B–S1N) showed that the GCbt and CeA exhibit prominent projections all the way down to the rNST in the brainstem, the first site of entry of sweet and bitter taste signals from the periphery into the brain ( Spector and Travers, 2005 49. Spector, A.C. ∙ Travers, S.P. The representation of taste quality in the mammalian nervous system Behav. Cogn. Neurosci. Rev. 2005; 4 :143-191 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hayama and Ogawa, 2001 20. Hayama, T. ∙ Ogawa, H.

Forebrain projections to the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract in the hamster J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 422 :429-447 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). These long-range projections to the brainstem immediately suggested a strategy for top-down control of taste behaviors.
To identify the neurons representing sweet and bitter taste in the rNST, we infected rNST neurons with an AAV harboring a Synapsin1::GCaMP6s construct to drive expression of the activity reporter in most neurons of the rNST ( Chen et al., 2013 9.

Major role of a negative regulatory mechanism J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :3317-3323 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ) and recorded responses to various taste stimuli using fiber photometry ( Gunaydin et al., 2014 17. Gunaydin, L.A. ∙ Grosenick, L. ∙ Finkelstein, J.C. ... Natural neural projection dynamics underlying social behavior Cell. 2014; 157 :1535-1551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 A). To ensure that all taste stimuli were effectively delivered to the tongue, we used an intra-oral cannula stimulus delivery system ( Phillips and Norgren, 1970 40. Phillips, M.I. ∙ Norgren, R.E. A rapid method for permanent implantation of intraoral fistula in rats Behav. Res. Meth. Instrum. 1970; 2 :124 Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar ). As anticipated, the rNST houses neurons exhibiting robust responses to all five basic taste qualities ( Figures 2 B and S2 A). Next we searched the publicly available Allen Mouse Brain Atlas ( https://www.alleninstitute.org/ ) for genes that mark subsets of rNST neurons ( Zhang et al., 2019 65. Zhang, J. ∙ Jin, H. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Sour Sensing from the Tongue to the Brain Cell. 2019; 179 :392-402.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then infected the rNST of candidate Cre driver lines with an AAV carrying a Cre-dependent GCaMP6s activity reporter ( Chen et al., 2013 9. Chen, T.W. ∙ Wardill, T.J. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity Nature. 2013; 499 :295-300 Crossref Scopus (4323) PubMed Google Scholar ) and showed that somatostatin-positive neurons ( Sst ) ( Taniguchi et al., 2011 52. Taniguchi, H. ∙ He, M. ∙ Wu, P. ... A resource of Cre driver lines for genetic targeting of GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex Neuron. 2011; 71 :995-1013 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1313) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thek et al., 2019 54. Thek, K.R. ∙ Ong, S.J.M. ∙ Carter, D.C. ... Extensive Inhibitory Gating of Viscerosensory Signals by a Sparse Network of Somatostatin Neurons J. Neurosci. 2019; 39 :8038-8050 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) are tuned to bitter tastes, whereas Calbindin 2-positive neurons ( Calb2 ) ( Taniguchi et al., 2011 52. Taniguchi, H. ∙ He, M. ∙ Wu, P. ... A resource of Cre driver lines for genetic targeting of GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex Neuron. 2011; 71 :995-1013 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1313) PubMed Google Scholar ) respond selectively to sweet tastants ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Importantly, the neurons expressing Sst in the rNST are different from those expressing Calb2 , with no overlap ( Figure S4 ). Moreover, these two populations of neurons are intermingled, with no discernable topographic organization. Of course, labeled line coding is independent of topography. Hence, neurons representing the different tastes can exhibit significant topographic segregation (like sweet and bitter in the taste cortex) ( Chen et al., 2011 8. Chen, X. ∙ Gabitto, M. ∙ Peng, Y. ... A gustotopic map of taste qualities in the mammalian brain Science. 2011; 333 :1262-1266 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ) or be intermingled like in the rNST without affecting their labeled line tuning properties.
To demonstrate that the taste responses of Sst - and Calb2 -expressing neurons originate from selective activation of bitter and sweet TRCs on the tongue, we repeated the fiber photometry recording experiments in animals lacking the taste signaling channel TRPM5; this ion channel is required for bitter and sweet but not sour or salty taste ( Damak et al., 2006 11. Damak, S. ∙ Rong, M. ∙ Yasumatsu, K. ... Trpm5 null mice respond to bitter, sweet, and umami compounds Chem. Senses. 2006; 31 :253-264 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2003 64. Zhang, Y. ∙ Hoon, M.A. ∙ Chandrashekar, J. ... Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways Cell. 2003; 112 :293-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1088) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, all bitter responses from Sst -expressing neurons and all sweet responses from Calb2 neurons were abolished in the Trpm5 knockout animals ( Figures S2 D–S2F).
If the Sst and Calb2 populations in the rNST are the conduits of bitter and sweet taste from the periphery into the brain, then their selective ablation should abolish behavioral responses to bitter and sweet stimuli, respectively. Thus, we engineered mice where these brainstem neurons were genetically removed by targeting a Cre-dependent diphtheria toxin A (DTA) virus to the rNST (AAV-Flex-DTA) ( Wu et al., 2014 61. Wu, Z. ∙ Autry, A.E. ∙ Bergan, J.F. ... Galanin neurons in the medial preoptic area govern parental behaviour Nature. 2014; 509 :325-330 Crossref Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tested the animals’ responses to sweet and bitter stimuli before and after genetic ablation (see STAR Methods for details).
Freely moving animals were trained to drink from a center spout delivering random presentations of water, bitter, sweet, or sour stimuli ( Zhang et al., 2003 64. Zhang, Y. ∙ Hoon, M.A. ∙ Chandrashekar, J. ... Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways Cell. 2003; 112 :293-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1088) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 A); to motivate sampling of aversive stimuli, animals were water deprived prior to the test ( STAR Methods ). As expected, control animals displayed aversion to bitter and sour compounds and attraction to sweet ( Figures 3 B, 3D, and 3E). However, after DTA-mediated cell ablation of Sst neurons in the rNST, the animals no longer avoided bitter and avidly drank bitter solutions, even at exceedingly high concentrations (5 mM quinine [Qui]) ( Mueller et al., 2005 31. Mueller, K.L. ∙ Hoon, M.A. ∙ Erlenbach, I. ... The receptors and coding logic for bitter taste Nature. 2005; 434 :225-229 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 C and 3D). In contrast, responses to other tastants, including aversion to sour and attraction to sweet, remained largely unaffected ( Figures 3 C and 3E). These data substantiate the Sst population as specifically required for mediating bitter taste responses. Next we engineered animals with ablated Calb2 -expressing neurons in the rNST. These animals exhibited dramatic loss of attractive responses to sweet stimuli, as seen by using an immediate lick behavioral test ( Figure 3 F) or a two-bottle preference assay ( Figure 3 H), even when using exceptionally high concentrations of sweet tastants (e.g., 20 mM acesulfame potassium [AceK]) ( Zhao et al., 2003 66. Zhao, G.Q. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Hoon, M.A. ... The receptors for mammalian sweet and umami taste Cell. 2003; 115 :255-266 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1055) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the attractive responses to a different appetitive stimulus (low salt) and the aversive responses to bitter and sour stimuli were unimpaired ( Figure 3 G). These results validate the Calb2 population as indispensable for behavioral attraction to sweet taste.
If Sst and Calb2 neurons are the neural substrates for the tastes of bitter and sweet in the brainstem, then their selective activation should drive the corresponding taste behaviors in the absence of any taste stimuli. Furthermore, in a taste discrimination assay, their selective activation should be recognized as a “bitter” or a “sweet” stimulus even when the animals are sampling only water.
We introduced channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) ( Boyden et al., 2005 6. Boyden, E.S. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ Bamberg, E. ... Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8 :1263-1268 Crossref Scopus (3720) PubMed Google Scholar ) into the rNST of Sst-cre or Calb2-cre animals by targeted infection with an AAV-Flex-ChR2 virus and used a behavioral test where ChR2-expressing animals were assayed for water drinking in a head-attached behavioral assay ( Peng et al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; see STAR Methods for details). Mice were subjected to testing sessions consisting of interleaved water-alone trials and water trials linked to lick-triggered photo-stimulation ( Figure 4 A). Notably, the laser shutter was placed under contact-licking operation; hence, the animal has control of its own stimulation during the light-on trials, and only self-stimulation would continue to trigger appetitive responses. In contrast, an animal would immediately terminate licking when contact-licking elicited aversion. Indeed, our results showed that optogenetic activation of Sst neurons triggered immediate suppression of licking ( Figures 4 B and 4C), whereas photo-activation of Calb2 neurons elicited avid enhancement of licking ( Figures 4 D and 4E).
Next we trained animals to report the identity of a tastant by using a three-port behavioral assay ( Wang et al., 2018 56. Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ... The coding of valence and identity in the mammalian taste system Nature. 2018; 558 :127-131 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this test, mice learned to sample a taste cue from a center spout (for example, random presentations of a sweet or a bitter chemical) and then report its identity by going to the right or left port; a correct response was rewarded with water ( Figure 4 F). This learned behavior requires that the animal samples the cue, identifies the tastant, and executes the appropriate choice in each trial. If activation of the Calb2 and Sst neurons evokes internal representations resembling those to the orally applied sweet and bitter chemicals, then optogenetic stimulation should generalize to the learned response associated with that taste ( Peng et al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2018 56. Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ... The coding of valence and identity in the mammalian taste system Nature. 2018; 558 :127-131 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Animals expressing ChR2 in Calb2 neurons were trained to recognize three taste cues: sweet (in this example, go left), bitter (go right), and water containing a very small amount of NaCl (we used 3 mM NaCl to differentiate it from the water reward, also go right). After training, mice successfully reported the identity of the testing solutions with over 90% accuracy ( Figure 4 G, see legend for details). Then we examined whether direct optogenetic activation of the Calb2 neurons is also recognized as sweet. Our results ( Figure 4 G) demonstrated that animals reliably reported stimulation of Calb2 -expressing neurons in the rNST as a sweet stimulus.
We performed similar experiments by optogenetically stimulating the Sst bitter neurons. In this case, animals were trained to recognize bitter (for example, go right), sweet (go left), and 3 mM NaCl (go left). Our results ( Figure 4 H) showed that optogenetic stimulation of Sst -expressing neurons in the rNST is consistently recognized as a bitter stimulus.
To further validate the capacity of the animals to correctly report the identity of the different tastants (and recognition of optogenetic activation of Sst neurons as a “bitter” stimulus), we also developed a four-port behavioral test consisting of a tastant delivery port and 3 separate response/reward ports, one for each tastant ( Figure 4 I). In this assay, mice were given random presentations of sweet, bitter, and salty stimuli, and they had to report the identity of the test stimulus in each trial by choosing the proper response port for each tastant (e.g., sweet = go to port 1, salt = go to port 2, bitter = go to port 3). After training (see STAR Methods for details), mice learned to successfully report the identity of each of the 3 tastants with over 80% accuracy; in contrast, a novel stimulus produced only random responses ( Figure 4 J). As anticipated, optogenetic stimulation of Sst -expressing neurons in the rNST was indeed recognized as a bitter stimulus ( Figure 4 J, light).
The functional validation of Sst and Calb2 neurons in the rNST as essential conduits of bitter and sweet taste provided a substrate to dissect why and how bitter overrides a sweet stimulus in eliciting behavioral responses. The strategy was to introduce the GCaMP activity reporter in Calb2 neurons in the rNST and determine how their response to a sweet tastant is altered when the animal is co-stimulated with a bitter tastant in a sweet-bitter mixed stimulus. The recordings shown in Figure 5 A demonstrate that sweet taste responses from Calb2 neurons are dramatically suppressed when a sweet stimulus is presented in the presence of a bitter tastant. In contrast, sweet stimuli have no effect on the activity of bitter rNST neurons ( Figure 5 B).
We hypothesized that the bitter-evoked suppression of incoming sweet taste signals in the rNST may be mediated by top-down modulation from the cortex to the rNST ( Figures 1 C and 1D) and, accordingly, predicted that optogenetic activation of the GCbt while the animal is sampling a sweet-only stimulus should result in suppression of the sweet-evoked signals in the rNST. Optogenetic activation of GCbt has been shown previously to reliably trigger bitter taste responses (including the appropriate orofacial actions, recognition of the optogenetic signal as a “bitter taste” in behavioral discrimination assays, lick suppression, and corresponding behavioral aversion) ( Peng et al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2018 56. Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ... The coding of valence and identity in the mammalian taste system Nature. 2018; 558 :127-131 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we expressed ChR2 in excitatory neurons in the GCbt by using AAV- Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-ChR2 ( Peng et. al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) and examined how their optogenetic activation modulates the tastant-evoked responses of sweet Calb2 neurons. As predicted, our results demonstrated that stimulation of the GCbt strongly suppressed propagation of sweet signals by inhibiting the activity of the sweet neurons in the rNST ( Figure 5 C). Notably, we also examined the effect of GCbt on bitter neurons in the rNST and uncovered a second feedback circuit: stimulation of GCbt significantly enhanced the activity of bitter-evoked activity in bitter-coding Sst neurons ( Figure 5 D). Thus, bitter signals, when they reach the taste cortex, feed back positively onto bitter neurons in the brainstem, amplifying the responses elicited by bitter tastants, while exerting negative feedback onto sweet-responding neurons, suppressing and minimizing sweet-evoked activity.
To uncover the physiological basis for the top-down feedback control from the cortex, we carried out patch-clamp recordings from individual bitter and sweet neurons in the rNST. We engineered mice where a tdTomato fluorescent reporter was targeted to Sst or Calb2 neurons and recorded from the tdTomato-labeled cells in the rNST using a brainstem slice preparation ( Hardaway et al., 2019 18. Hardaway, J.A. ∙ Halladay, L.R. ∙ Mazzone, C.M. ... Central Amygdala Prepronociceptin-Expressing Neurons Mediate Palatable Food Consumption and Reward Neuron. 2019; 102 :1088 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Petreanu et al., 2007 39. Petreanu, L. ∙ Huber, D. ∙ Sobczyk, A. ... Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping of long-range callosal projections Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10 :663-668 Crossref Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 6 A; see STAR Methods for details). Importantly, the same animals also expressed a ChR2-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) construct in the GCbt (and, therefore, their projections to the brainstem expressed ChR2 and were marked by YFP expression). Our results demonstrated that Sst bitter neurons in the rNST indeed receive excitatory input from the GCbt ( Figures 6 B–6D and S6 A–S6K). We recorded from 77 Sst neurons, and ~35% (28 of 77) of the tdTomato-labeled neurons were strongly activated by optogenetic stimulation of GCbt projections in the rNST ( Figures 6 E and S6 B–S6K). As would be expected for excitatory input, these responses were blocked by the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor antagonist DNQX (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) ( Honoré et al., 1988 22. Honoré, T. ∙ Davies, S.N. ∙ Drejer, J. ... Quinoxalinediones: potent competitive non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists Science. 1988; 241 :701-703 Crossref Scopus (1109) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 6 D and 6E). Of note, a fraction of these rNST Sst + neurons (7 of 28) also exhibited inhibitory currents that were blocked by TTX (tetrodotoxin) ( Narahashi et al., 1964 33. Narahashi, T. ∙ Moore, J.W. ∙ Scott, W.R. Tetrodotoxin Blockage of Sodium Conductance Increase in Lobster Giant Axons J. Gen. Physiol. 1964; 47 :965-974 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S6 G–S6L), demonstrating that they were mediated via activation of inhibitory interneurons; these inhibitory inputs likely help maintain the excitation/inhibition balance and prevent potential runaway feedforward excitation ( Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011 23.

To directly validate the top-down monosynaptic connections between the bitter taste cortex (GCbt) and Sst neurons in the brainstem, we used a retrograde viral tracer ( Figure S7 A). In essence, we infected the rNST of Sst - cre animals with a cocktail of AAV viruses harboring a Cre-dependent viral receptor (TVA [avian tumor virus receptor A]) to restrict infection of the transsynaptic viral tracer to Sst + neurons, a glycoprotein coat gene (G) required for viral packaging and transfer (to limit transsynaptic transfer monosynaptically), and red fluorescent reporters (mKate/mCherry) ( Reardon et al., 2016 41. Reardon, T.R. ∙ Murray, A.J. ∙ Turi, G.F. ...

Wickersham, I.R. ∙ Finke, S. ∙ Conzelmann, K.K. ... Retrograde neuronal tracing with a deletion-mutant rabies virus Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :47-49 Crossref Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar , 2007b 59. Wickersham, I.R. ∙ Lyon, D.C. ∙ Barnard, R.J. ... Monosynaptic restriction of transsynaptic tracing from single, genetically targeted neurons Neuron. 2007; 53 :639-647 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two weeks after the initial infection, the rNST was infected with the retrograde RABV-ΔG-GFP rabies virus. Our results ( Figure S7 B) showed efficient transfer of the rabies reporter from the rNST to the GCbt, confirming the monosynaptic connections between GCbt neurons in the cortex and Sst bitter neurons in the rNST.
Next we studied the basis for bitter-mediated suppression of Calb2 sweet neurons. We performed similar recording experiments using brainstem slices with Calb2 sweet neurons labeled with tdTomato and GCbt projections expressing ChR2-YFP. Surprisingly, we found no significant numbers of Calb2 neurons that received input from the GCbt (only 1 of 23 cells in 5 animals showed excitatory input from the GCbt; data not shown). We hypothesized that the GCbt may exert its modulation on sweet neurons in the rNST via the amygdala (the CeA and its projections to the rNST, as shown in Figures 1 C and 1D; Wang et al., 2018 56. Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ... The coding of valence and identity in the mammalian taste system Nature. 2018; 558 :127-131 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we engineered animals expressing ChR2 in the CeA and recorded from tdTomato-labeled Calb2 sweet neurons ( Figure 6 F). We patched 11 Calb2 sweet neurons from multiple animals, and, indeed, every one exhibited a strong inhibitory response following optogenetic activation of the CeA→ rNST projections ( Figures 6 G–6I). As expected, these responses were blocked by the GABA receptor blocker PTX (picrotoxin) ( Newland and Cull-Candy, 1992 36. Newland, C.F. ∙ Cull-Candy, S.G. On the mechanism of action of picrotoxin on GABA receptor channels in dissociated sympathetic neurones of the rat J. Physiol. 1992; 447 :191-213 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ) but were unaffected by DNQX, substantiating their inhibitory nature ( Figures 6 H and 6I). To validate the monosynaptic connections between CeA and Calb2 neurons in the rNST, we also carried out retrograde viral tracing experiments ( Figure S7 C).
Finally, to demonstrate that the amygdala-evoked suppression indeed originates in vivo in the GCbt (via its major projections to the CeA; Wang et al., 2018 56. Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ... The coding of valence and identity in the mammalian taste system Nature. 2018; 558 :127-131 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), we implanted stimulating optical fibers over the amygdala of mice expressing ChR2 in the GCbt and assayed whether ChR2 activation of GCbt-to-CeA projections suppresses the sweet-evoked activity in Calb2 neurons. As predicted, optogenetic activation of GCbt terminals in the CeA re-capitulated the strong inhibition of Calb2 sweet neurons observed when directly stimulating the GCbt ( Figure 5 E). Not surprisingly, stimulation of GCbt projections to the CeA had no effect on the activity of Sst bitter neurons in the rNST ( Figure 5 F). These results explain the cellular and physiological basis for the positive and negative feedback from the bitter taste cortex: direct excitatory input from the GCbt onto bitter brainstem neurons to enhance incoming bitter signals and inhibitory input via the CeA to concomitantly suppress the activity of the incoming sweet signals in the brainstem.
A key prediction of our results is that if the CeA to rNST negative feedback indeed mediates bitter-evoked suppression of incoming sweet signals in vivo , then blocking the top-down CeA-to-rNST feedback should abolish bitter-evoked inhibition of sweet signals.
First we pharmacologically silenced the CeA by infusion of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide) ( Tye et al., 2011 55. Tye, K.M. ∙ Prakash, R. ∙ Kim, S.Y. ... Amygdala circuitry mediating reversible and bidirectional control of anxiety Nature. 2011; 471 :358-362 Crossref Scopus (941) PubMed Google Scholar ). We implanted cannulas bilaterally into the CeA, waited 2 weeks for recovery, and assayed the responses of Calb2 neurons in the rNST before and after bilateral injection of NBQX ( Figure 7 A). Indeed, our results ( Figure 7 B) showed that Calb2 sweet responses are no longer suppressed by the presence of a bitter stimulus. As expected, loss of sweet suppression is fully reversible upon washout of the drug ( Figure 7 B). Next we examined the effect of CeA inhibition on behavior. We used a behavioral test where animals were exposed to drinking sessions consisting of random presentations of bitter, sweet, or the sweet-bitter mix ( Figure 7 C). Prior to pharmacological silencing, mice exhibited reduced licking to bitter stimuli, strong licking responses to sweet stimuli, and greatly reduced licking to the sweet-bitter mix ( Figure 7 D). However, after silencing, the animals showed a dramatic increase in attraction to the sweet-bitter mix ( Figure 7 D). Importantly, this behavioral change is fully reversible upon washout of the drug, whereas injection of a saline control in the CeA had no significant effect on the responses to any of the tastants ( Figure 7 D).
To directly demonstrate that the CeA-to-rNST projections drive bitter-evoked suppression of incoming sweet signals, we carried out photoinhibition experiments. We infected the CeA with AAVs harboring inhibitory opsins (Guillardia theta anion channel rhodopsin 1 [GtACR1] or enhanced halorhodopsin [eNpHR]) ( Govorunova et al., 2015 15. Govorunova, E.G. ∙ Sineshchekov, O.A. ∙ Janz, R. ... Natural light-gated anion channels: A family of microbial rhodopsins for advanced optogenetics Science. 2015; 349 :647-650 Crossref Scopus (464) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gradinaru et al., 2010 16. Gradinaru, V. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ Ramakrishnan, C. ... Molecular and cellular approaches for diversifying and extending optogenetics Cell. 2010; 141 :154-165 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (815) PubMed Google Scholar ) and placed the stimulating optical light fiber in the CeA projections to the rNST ( Figure 7 E, CeA → rNST); we utilized two different inhibitory opsins to minimize potential confounds arising from use of a single silencing strategy ( Wiegert et al., 2017 60. Wiegert, J.S. ∙ Mahn, M. ∙ Prigge, M. ... Silencing Neurons: Tools, Applications, and Experimental Constraints Neuron. 2017; 95 :504-529 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used a behavioral test where head-attached, motivated animals (i.e., thirsty) were trained to sample random presentations of 3 different stimuli: sweet, bitter, and the sweet-bitter mix. We then subjected the animals to sessions consisting of a series of trials, but in a fraction of the trials, the CeA-to-rNST projections were optogenetically silenced. Figure 7 F demonstrates that silencing negative feedback from the CeA to the rNST strongly relieves bitter-evoked suppression to a bitter-sweet mix with no significant effect on responses to sweet- or bitter-alone stimuli. In contrast, light stimulation of CeA→rNST projections that expressed a control GFP had no effect ( Figure 7 G). These pharmacological and optogenetic silencing studies validate the key role of the top-down inhibition in modulating responses to taste mixes of sweet-bitter stimuli. We note that, although the imperfect effect of the inhibitory opsins could be due to the inherent inefficiency of bilateral silencing, it may also be a reflection of additional bitter-evoked suppressing mechanisms, such as a local inhibitory circuit in the rNST ( Thek et al., 2019 54. Thek, K.R. ∙ Ong, S.J.M. ∙ Carter, D.C. ... Extensive Inhibitory Gating of Viscerosensory Signals by a Sparse Network of Somatostatin Neurons J.

Section: Discussion

Hardwired circuits and behaviors have been a prominent feature of lower organisms and have generally been viewed as encoding simple actions in the mammalian brain. In contrast, more complex behaviors have been thought to be primarily learned. However, this perspective has changed significantly as multifaceted behavioral ( Peng et al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), metabolic ( Münzberg et al., 2016 32. Münzberg, H. ∙ Qualls-Creekmore, E. ∙ Berthoud, H.R. ... Neural Control of Energy Expenditure Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2016; 233 :173-194 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), and physiological ( Zimmerman et al., 2017 67. Zimmerman, C.A. ∙ Leib, D.E. ∙ Knight, Z.A. Neural circuits underlying thirst and fluid homeostasis Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18 :459-469 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ) responses have been found to be mediated by hardwired circuits.
The taste system functions as the primary gate controlling feeding choices and consummatory behaviors and has emerged as one of the most salient examples of a multi-stage hardwired circuit in the mammalian brain. Previously, we showed that the sense of taste operates via labeled lines wired to trigger stereotyped behaviors ( Lee et al., 2017 27. Lee, H. ∙ Macpherson, L.J. ∙ Parada, C.A. ... Rewiring the taste system Nature. 2017; 548 :330-333 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mueller et al., 2005 31. Mueller, K.L. ∙ Hoon, M.A. ∙ Erlenbach, I. ... The receptors and coding logic for bitter taste Nature. 2005; 434 :225-229 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2003 66. Zhao, G.Q. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Hoon, M.A. ... The receptors for mammalian sweet and umami taste Cell. 2003; 115 :255-266 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1055) PubMed Google Scholar ), requiring no prior learning or experience ( Peng et al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, direct stimulation of the sweet or bitter (GCbt) cortical fields elicits entire behavioral programs normally evoked by orally applied sweet or bitter tastants. Most critically, however, optogenetic activation of the taste cortex also elicits the same taste responses in animals that have never experienced the “taste” of sweet or bitter (because of genetic removal of an essential taste-signaling component in TRCs; Peng et al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), confirming the predetermined nature of the sense of taste.
Here we showed that the hardwired neurons for sweet and bitter can be intermingled with each other without affecting their labeled-line properties, formally disentangling the concept and logic of labeled-line coding from topography; i.e., taste neurons can be segregated ( Chen et al., 2011 8. Chen, X. ∙ Gabitto, M. ∙ Peng, Y. ... A gustotopic map of taste qualities in the mammalian brain Science. 2011; 333 :1262-1266 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ; see also Figure S7 ) or intermingled independent of their single-taste coding properties.
We revealed how top-down control from the cortex can exert exquisite control over hardwired behaviors ( Liang et al., 2015 28. Liang, F. ∙ Xiong, X.R. ∙ Zingg, B. ... Sensory Cortical Control of a Visually Induced Arrest Behavior via Corticotectal Projections Neuron. 2015; 86 :755-767 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2016 29. Liu, B.H. ∙ Huberman, A.D. ∙ Scanziani, M. Cortico-fugal output from visual cortex promotes plasticity of innate motor behaviour Nature. 2016; 538 :383-387 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiong et al., 2015 62. Xiong, X.R. ∙ Liang, F. ∙ Zingg, B. ... Auditory cortex controls sound-driven innate defense behaviour through corticofugal projections to inferior colliculus Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7224 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results illustrate how the taste system uses dedicated feedback lines to modulate innate behavioral responses. The circuit logic is simple and elegant: to provide directed, opposing feedback that enhances behavioral aversion while suppressing attraction. Importantly, both act at the brainstem, the key nexus of signal propagation from the periphery into the brain, affording a powerful solution to ensuring bitter aversion in the mammalian taste system. This differs from insects like Drosophila , where the interaction between sweet and bitter signals takes place at the earlier stages, including at the sensory neuron level ( French et al., 2015 13. French, A.S. ∙ Sellier, M.J. ∙ Ali Agha, M. ... Dual mechanism for bitter avoidance in Drosophila J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :3990-4004 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Harris et al., 2015 19.

An odorant-binding protein required for suppression of sweet taste by bitter chemicals Neuron. 2013; 79 :725-737 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ) or presynaptically before the second-order neurons ( Chu et al., 2014 10. Chu, B. ∙ Chui, V. ∙ Mann, K. ... Presynaptic gain control drives sweet and bitter taste integration in Drosophila Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :1978-1984 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Do bitter signals in the rNST also locally inhibit Calb2 sweet neurons? The finding that suppression of sweet signals is dramatically weakened after blocking top-down negative feedback ( Figure 7 ) strongly argues that inhibition of incoming sweet signals (i.e., from the tongue to the rNST) is primarily initiated by CeA negative feedback. However, it is possible that a local inhibitory network in the brainstem may be activated by ascending bitter signals on their way to the cortex. At an evolutionary level, it would be advantageous to have multiple mechanisms ensuring suppression of sweet attraction by bitter signals.
The insular cortex, in addition to being a gustatory area, is also an important interoceptive site, integrating multisensory signals with the internal state ( Saper, 2002 44. Saper, C.B. The central autonomic nervous system: conscious visceral perception and autonomic pattern generation Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25 :433-469 Crossref Scopus (636) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, a number of studies have shown that behavioral repulsion to aversive tastes can be overcome by association with a strong positive reinforcer, such as alcohol ( Seif et al., 2013 47. Seif, T. ∙ Chang, S.J. ∙ Simms, J.A. ... Cortical activation of accumbens hyperpolarization-active NMDARs mediates aversion-resistant alcohol intake Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :1094-1100 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ; Siciliano et al., 2019 48. Siciliano, C.A. ∙ Noamany, H. ∙ Chang, C.J. ... A cortical-brainstem circuit predicts and governs compulsive alcohol drinking Science. 2019; 366 :1008-1012 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the future, it will be of interest to examine how the various taste stations in the brain interact and are modulated by each other and by internal state signals, like reward, nutritional needs, hunger, satiety, emotion, and expectation, to alter taste perception and taste-related behaviors.

All the stereotaxic surgery procedures were carried out using aseptic technique. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100/10 mg kg -1 , intraperitoneally). Mice were then placed onto a custom-built stereotaxic frame with a closed-loop heating system to maintain body temperature. The skin was incised at the midline to expose the skull and a small craniotomy (< 1 mm) was made at the site above regions of interest. The viral constructs were loaded into a pulled glass capillary and injected using nanoliter system at 30 nL min -1 with the total volume of 30 nL (AAV-fDIO-tdTomato, AAV-Flex-tdTomato, AAV-Flex-EGFP, AAV-CAG-tdTomato, AAV-CMV-EGFP), 200 nL (AAV-Syn-GCaMP6s and AAV-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6s), 50 nL (AAV-DIO-ChR2, AAV-CaMKIIa-hChR2 and AAV-Syn-ChR2) and 400 nL (AAV-Flex-dtA, AAV-hSyn-eNpHR3.0 and 1:1 mixture of AAV-Syn-Cre plus AAV-Flex-GtACR1). Viral injection is unilateral for photometry and optogenetic stimulation experiments and bilateral for ablation and photoinhibition experiments. The coordinates are: rNST (bregma −6.45 mm; lateral 1.1 mm; ventral 3.9 mm); bitter cortical field (bregma −0.35 mm; lateral 4.2 mm; ventral 2.7 mm); central amygdala (bregma −1.2 mm; lateral 2.9 mm; ventral 4.1 mm). For optogenetic implants, custom implantable fiber was made by gluing a 200 μm fiber bundle (NA = 0.39, Thorlabs) to a ceramic or metal ferrule (Thorlabs) and implanted unilaterally for activation of Sst and Calb2 neurons or bilaterally for inhibition of projections from CeA above rNST (bregma −6.45 mm; lateral 1.1 mm; ventral 3.55 mm), and unilaterally above CeA (bregma −1.2mm; lateral 2.9mm; ventral 3.7mm) for activation of bitter cortical projections. For photometry implants, a custom-made fiber from Doric Lenses (200 μm or 400 μm O.D., NA = 0.48) was used and implanted ~100 μm above the GCaMP virus injection site. For pharmacological inhibition experiments, guide cannulas (26 gauge, PlasticsOne) were bilaterally implanted above central amygdala (bregma −1.2 mm; lateral 2.9 mm; ventral 3.7 mm). The ventral coordinates listed above are relative to the pial surface. All the implants were secured onto the skull using dental cement. A head-post was placed for all head-attached behavioral tests. After surgery, the animals were returned to home-cage and allowed to recover for at least 10 days before any test.
The procedures to implant intraoral fistula were adapted from a previously described procedure on rats ( Phillips and Norgren, 1970 40. Phillips, M.I. ∙ Norgren, R.E. A rapid method for permanent implantation of intraoral fistula in rats Behav. Res. Meth. Instrum. 1970; 2 :124 Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar ). Basically, mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (100/10 mg kg -1 , intraperitoneally) and given antibiotic mixture (ampicillin and gentamicin) subcutaneously. An incision was then made on the side to expose the cranium. A curved needle was inserted under the skin along the lateral surface of the skull, and guided a catheter tubing subcutaneously to exit in the mouth lateral to the 4th molar. The mouth-end of catheter tubing was trimmed and the loose top end was secured onto the skull surface with dental cement. A head-post was placed for head-attached infusion. In the 2-3 days following implantation, mice were given antibiotic mixture daily to prevent infection.
Head-attached licking preference assay was performed essentially as described ( Peng et al., 2015 38. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, prior to test, thirsty animals (water deprived for 24-48 h) were acclimated to head-restraint and drinking from a motorized swing spout (2 training sessions per day for at least 2 days). Each trial started with a light flash, followed 1 s later by the spout swinging into position and a tone cue to indicate the onset of water delivery; after 5 s (during which mice could lick) the spout moved out of position. Training session at the acclimation phase lasted for 15 mins and consisted of 60 water trials (5-10 μL water per trial). To measure attractive responses ( Figures 4 D and 4E), before test, mice were mildly water deprived (24 h) and if necessary, supplied with water until exhibited, on average, 5-15 licks in 5 s licking window. During test, mice were provided with 2-5 μL of water at the beginning of each trial. To measure aversive response ( Figures 4 B and 4C), mice were water deprived for 36 h and provided with 5-10 μL of water per trial. Test session consisted of 10 water alone trials interspersed with 10 water plus laser trials (laser delivered upon licking). To examine the effect of photo-inhibiting CeA-to-rNST projections ( Figures 7 E–7G), mice were water deprived for 36 h and tested in sessions consisting of randomly presented tastant (AceK, Qui, and AceK-Qui mix) trials; half of them were coupled with laser stimulation (laser on throughout the trial). Licking events were video tracked and determined by a custom-written MATLAB code. The control of the behavioral apparatus was performed with a program written in MATLAB interfacing with Arduino.
We measured taste preference in freely moving mice using a custom-built gustometer ( Zhang et al., 2003 64. Zhang, Y. ∙ Hoon, M.A. ∙ Chandrashekar, J. ... Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways Cell. 2003; 112 :293-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1088) PubMed Google Scholar ). The behavior apparatus had a motorized shutter controlling mice’s access to a drinking spout which consisted of a main tube enclosing 5 separate lines, each delivering a different tastant. Mice were water-deprived for 24-48 h and trained to drink from the spout in a 15 min session of free access to water (shutter open during the entire session and water delivered upon licking). To test attraction to sweet ( Figure 3 ), mice were singly housed with 0.5-1 g of food and 1.5-2.5 mL of water 24 h before test, such that they were sufficiently hungry and slightly thirsty to prefer sweet over water. To test aversion to bitter and sour ( Figure 3 ), mice were water deprived for 36 h before test such that they were sufficiently thirsty to be motivated to sample aversive tastants. To test salt preference ( Figure 3 ), animals were injected with furosemide (50 mg kg -1 , intraperitoneally) 24 h prior to the test and provided with a salt-deficient diet (ENVIGO) ( Chandrashekar et al., 2010 7. Chandrashekar, J. ∙ Kuhn, C. ∙ Oka, Y. ... The cells and peripheral representation of sodium taste in mice Nature. 2010; 464 :297-301 Crossref Scopus (526) PubMed Google Scholar ); water was removed 6 h prior to the test. For measuring licking responses shown in Figure 1 A, mice were singly housed with 0.5-1 g of food and 1.5-2.5 mL of water 24 h before testing. Test sessions consisted of 60 trials with randomly presented tastants. The licking events were collected by a capacitive touch sensor and analyzed by a custom-written MATLAB code. The behavioral apparatus was controlled by a custom-written MATLAB software interfacing with Arduino. Dose-response behavioral assay ( Figure S1 A) was performed using a Davis MS160-mouse gustometer ( Glendinning et al., 2002 14. Glendinning, J.I. ∙ Gresack, J. ∙ Spector, A.C. A high-throughput screening procedure for identifying mice with aberrant taste and oromotor function Chem. Senses. 2002; 27 :461-474 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with 6 independent channels. Animals were semi-restrained in a small chamber within the gustometer. Animals were water deprived 24-48 h, habituated for 2-3 days and then tested over the following 3-4 days. Animals were tested with 2 test sessions, consisting of 48 trials each, with 28 randomly presented sucrose alone trials and 4 trials of each type (Qui concentration) of sucrose-quinine mix (high sucrose alone to mix ratio was necessary to motivate animals to lick). Lick counts, inter-lick interval and lick latency were automatically recorded for each trial.
Two-bottle preference assay was performed essentially as described previously ( Nelson et al., 2001 35. Nelson, G. ∙ Hoon, M.A. ∙ Chandrashekar, J. ... Mammalian sweet taste receptors Cell. 2001; 106 :381-390 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1482) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, in the first day of 24 h period, the baseline preference for two bottles both containing water was determined. AceK then replaced water in the less preferred bottle for subsequent measurement. The consumption of AceK (1.5 mM and 20 mM) solutions versus water over 24 h was measured. The preference ratio was calculated as V AceK /V water where V AceK was volume drunk from the AceK bottle and V water was volume drunk from the water bottle.
Three-port taste discrimination assay: mice were trained in a customized three-spout chamber within a sound-attenuating cubicle (Med Associates) to report the identity of tastant cues at the middle spout, for each trial in 100-trial sessions, by choosing between the right or the left spout for water reward. Mice were water deprived 24-48 h to begin training. Thereafter, they generally received water only during ~2 sessions/day of training. Each trial began with the middle-spout shutter opening, allowing access to the tastant cue. Mice were given 60 s to initiate sampling. Upon initiation, right/left shutter opened, and the mouse had 4 s to receive water reward. For the first 2-3 days of training, only the shutter to the correct side opened upon cue-sampling initiation, guiding the mouse to the correct spout (right for sweet and left for bitter or vice versa). Thereafter, both shutters opened simultaneously, forcing the mouse to choose right or left. Correct choices resulted in water reward, after which the shutters closed; the next trial began after 10 s. Incorrect choices resulted in the shutters immediately closing and a punishment of 5 s “timeout” (in addition to the 10 s inter-trial interval). Tastant cues were psuedo-random. Initial training was with sweet (4 mM AceK) and bitter (1 mM quinine). After mice reached ~90% accuracy (~1 week), a third cue, 3 mM NaCl, was added to their training (followed by water reward at the sweet side for Sst experiments and at the bitter side for Calb2 experiments). After training Sst mice with 3 mM NaCl (additional 1-2 weeks), in order to prepare them for the test session and hinder learning during the test session that there is no reward on laser trials mice were trained for an additional 1-2 days with sessions in which they received water reward on only 70% of the trials. The other 30% of the trials were treated as test trials for which regardless of which side they chose, the shutters immediately closed and there was no time-out punishment. Calb2 mice were given the 70%-reward training before being exposed to 3 mM NaCl, and close to testing they were given brief training with 3 mM NaCl as necessary for them go to the bitter side in response to 3 mM NaCl. Test sessions consisted of 86 pseudo-randomized trials, with 10 trials of 3 mM NaCl (all rewarded if correct) and 10 trials of 3 mM NaCl + laser (all unrewarded, regardless of choice). The other 66 trials were divided between sweet and bitter trials, 70% rewarded trials and 30% unrewarded trials.
Four-port taste discrimination assay: mice were trained in three stages using a customized behavioral chamber consisting of a tastant sampling port at its front side and three water reward ports (port 1, 2 and 3) on the opposite side (see Figure 4 I). Mice were first trained to identify sweet (4 mM AceK) versus salt (60 mM NaCl) by choosing between port 1 or 2. A correct choice was rewarded with 5 s of water and the incorrect one resulted in 5 s of “timeout” (see above for three-port assay). This training was carried out for ~2 sessions a day with 120 trials per session for ~2 weeks. After the accuracy of reporting sweet and salty stimuli exceeded 80%, mice were switched to salty-bitter training sessions in which they learned to report salt (60 mM NaCl) and bitter (1 mM quinine) by going to port 2 or 3 for the water reward. This training lasted about 4-5 weeks. Intermittently, mice were retrained in sweet-salty sessions to prevent extinction. After the accuracy of reporting salty and bitter reached more than 80%, mice were subjected to the sweet-salty-bitter training sessions until they reliably reported each of the three stimuli (additional 4-5 weeks). Test sessions consisted of 10 unrewarded trials of 3mM NaCl, 10 unrewarded trials of 3mM NaCl + laser, and rewarded sweet, salty and bitter trials (27 trials each).
For both assays, licks were registered via a capacitive touch sensor (MPR121), and fluid delivery, laser, and shutters were controlled via an Arduino board by a custom MATLAB program which also controlled data acquisition.
For data shown in Figures 3 B–3G, mice were first measured for their preference for sweet, bitter, sour and salty stimuli in the freely moving licking preference assay. After initial taste preference was measured, mice were bilaterally injected with 400 nL AAV-mCherry-Flex-dtA in the rNST to ablate selective neuronal population. Mice were recovered for 4-6 weeks, allowing sufficient DTA expression and cell ablation before testing for their post-DTA taste preference. In Figure 3 H, controls consisted of Calb2-cre negative mice receiving the same dose of DTA virus injection.
For all ChR2 stimulation experiments, 473 nm light pulses (diode-pumped solid-state laser, Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co.) were delivered via a custom-made optic cable (Thorlabs) and controlled by a custom-written MATLAB code via Arduino. Laser intensity was kept at 1-20 mW at the tip of fiber. In photoactivation behavior experiments, one lick triggered 1 s (50 pulses) of light stimulation (20 Hz, 20 ms per pulse) and licks during light stimulation extended the stimulation until 1 s after the final lick. For infusion coupled with light-stimulation of the bitter cortical field and bitter cortical projection in CeA, light was delivered in a 10 s time window when tastant was infused. For photoinhibition experiments, 589 nm (eNpHR) or 473 nm (GtACR1) light (diode-pumped solid-state laser, Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co.) was split using branching fiber-optic patch cord (Doric lenses) for bilateral illumination. Constant light (3-10 mW at the tip of fiber) was maintained throughout the light-on trials.
For photometry recording during intraoral infusion in awake animals ( Figures 2 , 5 , 7 A, S2 A, S2 D–S2F, and S5 ), at least 3 days after intraoral fistula implantation, mice were adapted to head restraint and intraoral infusion by receiving water through intraoral fistula (0.8 mL min -1 , 15 mins) using a syringe pump. After 3 consecutive daily adaption sessions, mice were subjected to experimental session consisting of multiple tastant infusion trials while being fiber photometry recorded. An infusion trial consisted of 10 s of infusion of tastant by syringe pump at the speed of 0.8 mL min -1 , preceded by 30 s pre-infusion interval and followed by 30 s post-infusion interval. During pre and post infusion intervals, water was flowing at the speed of 0.8 mL min -1 . For photometry during licking ( Figures S2 B and S2C), the animals were head-restrained and trained to lick from a motorized swing spout (see method of head-attached licking preference assay). Prior to recording sessions, animals were water deprived for 36 h to motivate licking. To record taste evoked response in Sst and Calb2 neurons in rNST during licking, the animals were given 0.5 s to lick from tastants and a dry spout in a recording session; this short lick time window (0.5 s) enforced similar lick counts across stimuli.
Bulk Ca + dependent GCaMP fluorescence signals were measured using fiber photometry as described previously ( Gunaydin et al., 2014 17. Gunaydin, L.A. ∙ Grosenick, L. ∙ Finkelstein, J.C. ... Natural neural projection dynamics underlying social behavior Cell. 2014; 157 :1535-1551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 465 nm and 405 nm light from connectorized light-emitting diodes (Doric Lenses) was combined in a connectorized fluorescence mini-cube and delivered into the brain. The emission fluorescence was then focused onto a femtowatt photodetector (NewPort) before outputting to an amplifier. The amplified signals were digitized by LabJack U6-Pro and recorded using custom MATLAB code via LabJack U6-Pro with 100 Hz sampling rate. The collected data were analyzed by custom MATLAB code. They were first extracted and subject to a low-pass filter at 2 Hz. A least-squares linear fit was then applied to produce a fitted 405 nm signal. The dF/F was calculated as: (F-F0)/F0, where F0 was the median fitted 405 nm signal in 3 s time window before the onset of tastant infusion. The calcium transients were identified using validated statistical measures (the median and Qn estimator) ( Rousseeuw and Croux, 1993 43. Rousseeuw, P.J. ∙ Croux, C. Alternatives to the median absolute deviation J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1993; 88 :1273-1283 Crossref Scopus (1587) Google Scholar ) and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by integrating fluorescence signal under identified calcium transients. The traces displayed were after fluorescence data were smoothed using a moving average method and downsampled to 5 Hz.
For pharmacological silencing in photometry recording, 400 nL of a cocktail of AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide, 25 mM in 0.9% NaCl, Tocris Bioscience) and NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (D-(-)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, 38 mM in 0.9% NaCl, Tocris Bioscience) was bilaterally infused into the CeA using a 1 μL Hamilton through an internal cannula (PlasticsOne) inserted into the guide cannula above the amygdala. 20 mins after infusion, mice were recorded for the photometry response to tastants delivered through intra-oral cannula. For pharmacological silencing in freely moving licking assay, mice were bilaterally infused with 200-300 nL of NBQX (12.5 mM), rested for 20-90 mins, and tested for their licking responses. Prior to behavioral testing for taste preference, the animals were water deprived for 36 h to motivate licking. As a control, the same animals were infused with equivalent volume of isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) and recorded/tested with identical experimental procedures.
The whole brain was cleared by cubic method essentially as described previously ( Susaki et al., 2014 50. Susaki, E.A. ∙ Tainaka, K. ∙ Perrin, D. ... Whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution using chemical cocktails and computational analysis Cell. 2014; 157 :726-739 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (933) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 51. Susaki, E.A. ∙ Tainaka, K. ∙ Perrin, D. ... Advanced CUBIC protocols for whole-brain and whole-body clearing and imaging Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :1709-1727 Crossref Scopus (513) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2018 56. Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ... The coding of valence and identity in the mammalian taste system Nature. 2018; 558 :127-131 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, mice were perfused with phospho-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 U/ml heparin and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were then post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 h. The fixed brains were first washed with PBS 3 times before immersion in cubic reagent 1 (diluted 1:2 in water) overnight. The brains were then switched to and incubated in reagent 1 for 7-10 days with new reagent 1 changed every other day. The reagent 1-treated brains were washed with PBS and degassed in PBS overnight before being transferred into cubic reagent 2 (diluted 1:2 in PBS). For the final clearing, the brains were immersed in reagent 2 containing TO-PRO3 (1:5, 000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3-7 days. Prior to imaging, the brains were equilibrated with a mineral and silicone oil mix (1:1). Images were acquired with a light-sheet fluorescence microscope (UltraMicroscope) with a 1.3X objective. The images were registered to a reference atlas using ANTs and further processed in ImageJ.
Sst-cre mice were infected with AAV-CAG-Flex-tdTomato in the rNST and AAV-CamKII-ChR2-EYFP in the GCbt. Calb2-cre mice were infected with AAV-CAG-Flex-tdTomato in the rNST and AAV-CamKII-ChR2-EYFP in the GCbt or AAV-Syn-ChR2-EYFP in the CeA. After viral infection, mice were allowed 2-4 months for recovery (2-4 months for Sst-cre mice and 2-3 months for Calb2-cre mice), enabling sufficient expression of ChR2 in the axonal terminals in the rNST. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg kg -1 , intraperitoneally), and then transcardially perfused with ice-cold oxygenated slicing solution. Coronal slices containing the rNST were sectioned into 300 μm thickness using a vibratome (VT-1000S, Leica) in ice-cold sucrose-based slicing solution (in mM: 213 sucrose, 26 NaHCO 3 , 10 dextrose, 2.5 KCl, 2.0 MgSO 4 , 2.0 CaCl 2 , and 1.23 NaH 2 PO 4 , aerated with 95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 ). Slices were transferred to oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; composition in mM: 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO 3 , 2.5 KCl, 2.0 MgSO 4 , 2.0 CaCl 2 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 and 25 dextrose, 315 mOsm, adjusted to pH 7.4) and incubated at 32°C for 40 minutes, then maintained at room temperature until use. Neurons were visualized using an upright infrared differential interference contrast microscope (BX51WI, Olympus). Calb2 or Sst neurons in the rNST infected with AAV-CAG-Flex-tdTomato were identified by fluorescence. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed at 32°C with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). The patch electrode (2.8 - 3.5 MΩ) was filled with intracellular solution (in mM: 125 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.6 EGTA, 10 QX-314 Chloride, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 290 mOsm, adjusted to pH 7.2). Data were sampled at 10 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz, and analyzed with Clampex10.4 software (Molecular Devices). Pulses of photostimulation (1 ms, 470 nm) were controlled by Clamplex software and delivered through an X-Cite XLED1 (Lumen Dynamics).
To record postsynaptic currents evoked by light pulses, the membrane potential of Calb2 or Sst neurons in rNST was held at −70 mV in voltage clamp mode ( Figure 6 ). GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents were blocked by PTX (Picrotoxin, 50 μM) applied through bath. Glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents were blocked by bath application of DNQX (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 10 μM). To distinguish EPSCs and IPSCs directly, in another set of experiments ( Figure S6 ), we used the following intracellular solution (in mM: 115 CsMeSO4, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 Na-GTP, 4 MgATP, 0.3 EGTA, 10 QX-314, 0.2% Biocytin, 290 mOsm, adjusted to pH 7.2). With this intracellular solution, EPSCs and IPSCs were recorded at voltage clamp mode by holding the neurons at −70mV and −10mV, respectively. Monosynaptic connection was defined by the postsynaptic currents with onset latencies less than 15 ms. Onset latency was defined as the time from light stimulus to the time at 10% of the peak amplitude of a postsynaptic event. To confirm monosynaptic connections, we applied TTX (Tetrodotoxin, 1 μM) and 4-AP (4-Aminopyridine, 1 mM) in the bath and the latencies and peak amplitudes of the evoked postsynaptic currents remained unchanged.
100 nL of AAV-Flex-TVA-mCherry and AAV-Flex-G(N2C)-mKate mixture (1:1) was injected into the rNST of Sst-cre or Calb2-cre animals. 2– 3 weeks later, rNST of these animals were infected with 100 nL RABV-N2C(ΔG)-GFP-EnvA. The animals were sacrificed in 7 – 14 days to identify and examine presynaptic neurons across the brain by histology.
Viral expression and placement of optic implants were verified at the termination of the experiments using DAPI counterstaining of 100 μm coronal sections (Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI, Invitrogen). For fluorescent in situ hybridization, fresh frozen brains were sectioned at 16 μm thickness and processed for mRNA detection using RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunostaining was performed as described before. Briefly, mice were intracardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA. Brains were dissected, fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, and then sliced coronally at 50 or 100 μm thickness. The brain sections were permeabilized and blocked with 10% normal donkey serum (EMD millipore) in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100, incubated with anti- Calb2 primary antibody (Immunostar 24445, 1: 500) at 4°C overnight, and labeled with fluorescent tagged secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 hr. To label biocytin filled neurons after slice recording, brain slices were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 mins at 4°C, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum and stained with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen S32357, 1:500) for 2 hr at room temperature. Images were acquired using an Olympus FluoView1000 confocal microscope. Cell numbers were counted manually.
Statistical tests were performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc analysis, unpaired t test or paired t test when appropriate. Each statistical test used was indicated in the respective figure legends. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
