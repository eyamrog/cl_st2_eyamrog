Title: Molecular recognition of morphine and fentanyl by the human μ-opioid receptor


Abstract: Summary

Morphine and fentanyl are among the most used opioid drugs that confer analgesia and unwanted side effects through both G protein and arrestin signaling pathways of μ-opioid receptor (μOR). Here, we report structures of the human μOR-G protein complexes bound to morphine and fentanyl, which uncover key differences in how they bind the receptor. We also report structures of μOR bound to TRV130, PZM21, and SR17018, which reveal preferential interactions of these agonists with TM3 side of the ligand-binding pocket rather than TM6/7 side. In contrast, morphine and fentanyl form dual interactions with both TM3 and TM6/7 regions. Mutations at the TM6/7 interface abolish arrestin recruitment of μOR promoted by morphine and fentanyl. Ligands designed to reduce TM6/7 interactions display preferential G protein signaling. Our results provide crucial insights into fentanyl recognition and signaling of μOR, which may facilitate rational design of next-generation analgesics.

Section: Introduction

Opioids are the most effective drugs for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, and they occupy the largest market share of analgesic medications. Opioids from poppy plant Papaver somniferum represent one of the most ancient plant-driven medications, whose usage as recreational and analgesic substances can be traced back to thousands of years ago ( Brownstein, 1993 7. Brownstein, M.J. A brief history of opiates, opioid peptides, and opioid receptors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90 :5391-5393 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). Medical uses of opioids for pain relief include opioid alkaloids and synthetic opioids, represented by morphine and fentanyl, two widely prescribed analgesics ( Manglik, 2020 44. Manglik, A. Molecular basis of opioid action: From structures to new leads Biol. Psychiatry. 2020; 87 :6-14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although opioids are potent painkillers, they also result in severe adverse effects such as addiction, respiratory suppression, and constipation, thereby limiting their clinical utilization ( Chan et al., 2017 9. Chan, H.C.S. ∙ McCarthy, D. ∙ Li, J. ... Designing safer analgesics via mu-opioid receptor pathways Trends Pharmacol.

Novel opioid analgesics and side effects ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2017; 8 :1638-1640 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Opioid overdose can cause death by respiratory suppression, which has led to a widely spread “opioid crisis,” especially in Northern America. According to reports released in 2019, more than 70% deaths from opioid crisis were due to overdose of synthetic opioids, mainly fentanyl and its derivatives such as carfentanil and lofentanil ( Mattson et al., 2021 50. Mattson, C.L. ∙ Tanz, L.J. ∙ Quinn, K. ... Trends and geographic patterns in drug and synthetic opioid overdose deaths - United States, 2013–2019 MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly.

Neurosci. 2020; 11 :3955-3967 Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar ).
Functions of opioids are mediated by a family of four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), namely μ, δ, κ, and nociception receptors ( Al-Hasani and Bruchas, 2011 2. Al-Hasani, R. ∙ Bruchas, M.R. Molecular mechanisms of opioid receptor-dependent signaling and behavior Anesthesiology. 2011; 115 :1363-1381 Crossref Scopus (732) PubMed Google Scholar ; Waldhoer et al., 2004 73. Waldhoer, M. ∙ Bartlett, S.E. ∙ Whistler, J.L. Opioid receptors Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73 :953-990 Crossref Scopus (682) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among these opioid receptors (ORs), μOR was revealed to be the main receptor for both the analgesic and adverse effects of morphine ( Matthes et al., 1996 49. Matthes, H.W. ∙ Maldonado, R. ∙ Simonin, F. ... Loss of morphine-induced analgesia, reward effect and withdrawal symptoms in mice lacking the mu-opioid-receptor gene Nature. 1996; 383 :819-823 Crossref Scopus (1478) PubMed Google Scholar ). Signaling of μOR is primarily transduced through G i to inhibit cAMP production. μOR can also signal through β-arrestin upon the receptor activation. It has been proposed that the opioid-induced analgesia is attributed to G i signaling of μOR, whereas the unwanted side effects such as respiratory suppression and constipation might be caused by β-arrestin signaling ( Bohn et al., 1999 6. Bohn, L.M. ∙ Lefkowitz, R.J. ∙ Gainetdinov, R.R. ... Enhanced morphine analgesia in mice lacking beta-arrestin 2 Science. 1999; 286 :2495-2498 Crossref Scopus (860) PubMed Google Scholar , 2000 5.

However, this proposal was challenged by recent findings, which suggest that the respiratory depression by opioids was due to G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel signaling and the opioid-induced severe side effects were independent of the β-arrestin pathway ( Kliewer et al., 2019 33.

Despite the G protein-selective μOR agonist hypothesis being increasingly controversial, tremendous efforts have been made during the past decades to screen and develop μOR agonists with attenuated arrestin signaling activities, with the hope to find better analgesics with fewer side effects ( Chan et al., 2017 9.

Several μOR agonists with negligible arrestin activities and potentially with better therapeutic windows than morphine and fentanyl have been identified and characterized, including oliceridine (TRV130), PZM21, and SR17018 ( Chen et al., 2013 13.

Among them, oliceridine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020 for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, although the in vivo studies in rodents and clinical trials indicating that the side effects remained ( Altarifi et al., 2017 3.

Pain Res. 2019; 12 :927-943 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). For PZM21, different results and interpretations also existed regarding its efficacy, signaling preference, and effects on respiratory depression and tolerance ( Hill et al., 2018 26. Hill, R. ∙ Disney, A. ∙ Conibear, A. ... The novel mu-opioid receptor agonist PZM21 depresses respiration and induces tolerance to antinociception Br. J.

Structure-based discovery of opioid analgesics with reduced side effects Nature. 2016; 537 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (711) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was suggested that the low efficacy in G protein pathway of the so-called biased ligands may explain their actions ( Gillis et al., 2020 22. Gillis, A. ∙ Gondin, A.B. ∙ Kliewer, A. ... Low intrinsic efficacy for G protein activation can explain the improved side effect profiles of new opioid agonists Sci. Signal. 2020; 13 :eaaz3140 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Detailed studies of ligands with various signaling properties would help to solve the above controversies. The signaling preference mechanism of μOR was investigated previously by methods including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and computational simulations ( Cong et al., 2021 15. Cong, X. ∙ Maurel, D. ∙ Déméné, H. ... Molecular insights into the biased signaling mechanism of the mu-opioid receptor Mol.

Residues W320 and Y328 within the binding site of the mu-opioid receptor influence opiate ligand bias Neuropharmacology. 2017; 118 :46-58 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the structural understanding of such mechanism is still lacking, which largely limited the design of new ligands of μOR with signal preference.
Notable progresses have been made in structural studies of μOR, including crystal structures of the mouse μOR bound to its antagonist β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA) ( Manglik et al., 2012 45. Manglik, A. ∙ Kruse, A.C. ∙ Kobilka, T.S. ... Crystal structure of the micro-opioid receptor bound to a morphinan antagonist Nature. 2012; 485 :321-326 Crossref Scopus (1133) PubMed Google Scholar ) and agonist BU72 ( Huang et al., 2015 28. Huang, W. ∙ Manglik, A. ∙ Venkatakrishnan, A.J. ... Structural insights into micro-opioid receptor activation Nature. 2015; 524 :315-321 Crossref Scopus (674) PubMed Google Scholar ), both of which are modified morphine analogs with high affinity to μOR. Recently, a 3.5 Å cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the mouse μOR-G i complex bound to the peptidomimetic agonist Tyr-D-Ala-Gly- N -Me-Phe-Gly-ol (DAMGO) was also reported ( Koehl et al., 2018 34. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the micro-opioid receptor-Gi protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the structure of μOR in complex with fentanyl, the main cause of the opioid crisis, is still lacking. Fentanyl exhibits many aspects of abnormal pharmacology ( Kelly et al., 2021 31. Kelly, E. ∙ Sutcliffe, K. ∙ Cavallo, D. ... The anomalous pharmacology of fentanyl Br J Pharmacol. 2021; Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar ), including the difficulty to be fitted into the binding pocket of BU72 and DAMGO, which have completely different chemical scaffolds from fentanyl ( de Waal et al., 2020 16. de Waal, P.W. ∙ Shi, J. ∙ You, E. ...

Intensive modeling efforts in fentanyl docking and simulation studies suggested many different binding modes, posing great challenges in understanding the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of numerous fentanyl derivatives ( de Waal et al., 2020 16. de Waal, P.W. ∙ Shi, J. ∙ You, E. ...

Commun. 2021; 12 :984 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we report five cryo-EM structures of the human μOR-G i complexes with morphine, fentanyl, SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21. These structures reveal distinct binding properties of morphine and fentanyl and the molecular determinants necessary for β-arrestin signaling of μOR. Based on these findings, we have designed fentanyl derivatives that showed largely attenuated or abolished β-arrestin activity while maintaining relatively intact G protein signaling compared with fentanyl.

Section: Results

DAMGO and morphine are two well-studied μOR agonists activating both G protein and β-arrestin pathways, whereas fentanyl was proposed to be preferential to β-arrestin compared with the above two ( Cong et al., 2021 15.

Bias factor and therapeutic window correlate to predict safer opioid analgesics Cell. 2017; 171 :1165-1175.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first characterized the signaling profiles of the six opioids with divergent chemical scaffolds used in this study: DAMGO, fentanyl, morphine, SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21 ( Figure S1 ). We tested their effects on G protein signaling pathways using cAMP accumulation and G i/o recruitment assays, and their effects on β-arrestin pathways using β-arrestin recruitment assay. All five ligands could activate μOR to inhibit the production of cAMP, with fentanyl, morphine, and PZM21 acting as full agonists, whereas SR17018 and TRV130 being partial agonists when using DAMGO as reference in cAMP assay ( Figure 1 B). Nevertheless, in G i/o recruitment assay, PZM21, TRV130, and SR17018 all acted as μOR partial agonists ( Figure S1 C). The difference in G i signaling efficacy of PZM21 resulting from different assays has been well acknowledged ( Gillis et al., 2020 22. Gillis, A. ∙ Gondin, A.B. ∙ Kliewer, A. ...

Similar to previous studies ( Manglik et al., 2016 46. Manglik, A. ∙ Lin, H. ∙ Aryal, D.K. ... Structure-based discovery of opioid analgesics with reduced side effects Nature. 2016; 537 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (711) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmid et al., 2017 62.

Engl. 2022; 61 :e202200269 PubMed Google Scholar ), no response signals were detected for PZM21 in β-arrestin recruitment assays, whereas only weak signal was produced for SR17018 and TRV130 ( Figures 1 B, S1 C, and S1D). In contrast, both morphine and fentanyl induced robust β-arrestin recruitments ( Figures 1 B, S1 C, and S1D; Table S1 ).
To investigate the ligand-binding mode and signaling profiles of μOR, we used single particle cryo-EM to determine the structures of μOR-G protein complexes bound to fentanyl, morphine, SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21 ( Figures 1 C and 1D; Table S2 ). Interestingly, we observed that the μOR-G i complexes with fentanyl, morphine, SR17018, and PZM21 appeared to exist as homodimers ( Figure S1 ). Further negative staining imaging and cryo-EM structure determination of the μOR-G i dimer indicated it to be an anti-parallel dimer, with the densities of two G proteins symmetrically distributed in opposite directions ( Figures S2 A and S2B).
The structures of μOR-G i complexes with fentanyl, morphine, SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21 were determined with global nominal resolutions ranging from 2.8 to 3.3 Å ( Figures S2 and S3 ). For each complex, the relatively high-resolution maps clearly showed most of the side chains and allowed us to model μOR from residues S66 to F352, including all three extracellular loops (ECLs) and three intracellular loops (ICLs) as well as helix 8 of μOR, the G i heterotrimer without the flexible α-helical domain of G αi1 , and scFv16 antibody. All ligands were clearly defined by the cryo-EM density maps ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S4 ).
Morphine and fentanyl are two widely used opioids and differ from each other in chemical scaffolds. Morphine belongs to the family of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids with a morphinan scaffold, whereas fentanyl contains an anilinopiperidine moiety with a phenylethyl attached to the amine group of a piperidine ring ( Figure S1 B). The differences in chemical structures of morphine and fentanyl may elicit distinct conformational changes in the orthosteric binding pocket (OBP) of μOR. Indeed, despite the overall structures of μOR bound to these two ligands are highly similar (RMSD = 0.3 Å for the Cα atoms of μOR), their binding modes are quite different ( Figures 2 A–2D).
In our structure, the fentanyl molecule occupies a “Y” shaped conformation in the orthosteric pocket and contacts mainly with residues from TM2, TM3, TM6, and TM7 of transmembrane domain (TMD) ( Figure 2 B). The phenylethyl moiety faces toward the cleft of TM2 and TM3, and the propionyl group toward TM6, where it makes hydrophobic interactions with I298 6.51 and V302 6.55 (Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering; Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995 4. Ballesteros, J.A. ∙ Weinstein, H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models and computational probing of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25 :366-428 Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar ; Figures 2 A and 2B). The n-aniline ring points downward to the core region of the TMD and forms a hydrophobic interaction network with residues M153 3.36 , W295 6.48 , I298 6.51 , and TM7 residues G327 7.42 and Y328 7.43 ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Compared with fentanyl, morphine adopts an elliptical “O” configuration, interacting with hydrophobic residues from TM3, TM6, and TM7 ( Figures 2 A and 2C). The morphinan group overlaps with the propionyl group of fentanyl, with the hydroxyl of the phenol moiety of morphinan pointing toward TM5 ( Figures 2 A and 2C). Both the amine groups in the piperidine ring of fentanyl and in the morphinan group of morphine form salt bridges with the carboxylate group of D149 3.32 ( Figures 2 B and 2C), which is a universal interaction of ligands with opioid and bioamine receptors ( Che et al., 2018 11.

Similar to the BU72-μOR structure, D149 3.32 also forms polar interactions with nearby residues Q126 2.60 and Y328 7.43 (DQY polar motif, hereafter) in both structures ( Figures 2 B and 2C). The DQY motif is conserved among ORs. Consistent with κOR and δOR, mutations in the DQY polar motif, including D149 3.32 A, Q126 2.60 K, and Y328 7.43 A, largely decreased potencies of both G protein and β-arrestin signaling of fentanyl and morphine, indicating that the DQY polar motif is crucial for μOR activation ( Figures 2 B and 2C; Tables S3–S5 ). Nevertheless, morphine is smaller and more compact than fentanyl and thus cannot form interactions equivalent to those mediated by the phenylethyl moiety and the n-aniline ring of fentanyl. The phenylethyl moiety of fentanyl occupies an extended hydrophobic minor pocket with residues from TM2 to TM3, including Q126 2.60 and W135 ECL1 ( Figure 2 D). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal stable binding of fentanyl and morphine in the OBP of μOR with RMSD values at 0.5–1.5 Å from the poses determined by cryo-EM ( Figure 2 E). In addition, mutations of residues around the ligand-binding pockets of fentanyl and morphine, including Y150 3.33 , M153 3.36 , V238 5.42 , I298 6.51 , and H299 6.52 , resulted in attenuated activities toward G protein and β-arrestin signaling of both ligands, further supporting their binding modes in each structure ( Figure 2 F; Tables S3–S5 ).
Fentanyl activates μOR 50–100 times more potently than morphine ( Mather, 1983 48. Mather, L.E. Clinical pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and its newer derivatives Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1983; 8 :422-446 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structures provide a molecular basis for such potency difference. The benzene ring of fentanyl forms direct π-π interactions with the toggle switch residue W295 6.48 and Y328 7.43 ( Figures 2 B and 2C), which is absent in the morphine bound μOR structure. In addition, the phenylethyl moiety of fentanyl interacts hydrophobically with a minor pocket of μOR between TM2 and TM3, which is not occupied by morphine ( Figures 2 B–2D). Mutations on residues near the minor pocket, including Q126A, W135A, and I146A, affected more on fentanyl’s potency than that of morphine ( Figures 2 F and 2G; Tables S3 and S4 ), indicating that the interaction in the minor pocket contributed to the higher potency of fentanyl to the receptor.
Comparisons of morphine or fentanyl bound μOR structures with that bound with the antagonist β-FNA shed light on the mechanism of μOR activation by morphine and fentanyl. Alignment of fentanyl and β-FNA bound structures reveals noticeable ligand induced conformational changes of μOR from the inactive to active states, including the twist of TM3, the inward movement of TM5, and the outward movement of TM6 in their intracellular parts, as well as clockwise rotations of TM2 and TM7 ( Figure 3 A). In the fentanyl bound μOR structure, the n-aniline ring formed a close π-π interaction with the toggle switch residue W295 6.48 , resulting in a 28° shift of W295 6.48 toward F289 6.44 of the P 5.50 I 3.40 F 6.44 core triad ( Figure 3 B). The binding of fentanyl also caused twists of TM3 residues, especially from the D 3.32 YYNM 3.36 motif. This leads to conformational changes of the DQY motif and I157 3.40 in the PIF triad, the collapse of the potential Na + pocket and the reconstruction of the water-mediated polar network containing residues D116 2.50 , N152 3.35 , S156 3.39 , N330 7.45 , and S331 7.46 ( Figures 3 B–3D). Similar to δOR ( Claff et al., 2019 14. Claff, T. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Blais, V. ... Elucidating the active delta-opioid receptor crystal structure with peptide and small-molecule agonists Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaax9115 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ), mutation of N152A in this polar network produced constitutive activation activity of μOR ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Moreover, compared with β-FNA, fentanyl adopted a pose facilitating the inward movement of TM5. The agonist induced inward movement of TM5 was demonstrated to be crucial for the activation of β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) ( Rasmussen et al., 2011 56. Rasmussen, S.G. ∙ DeVree, B.T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... Crystal structure of the beta2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex Nature. 2011; 477 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (2475) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhuang et al., 2021 83. Zhuang, Y. ∙ Xu, P. ∙ Mao, C. ... Structural insights into the human D1 and D2 dopamine receptor signaling complexes Cell. 2021; 184 :931-942.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Those conformational changes together lead to the rearrangement of PIF triad and NPxxY motif, the breaking of the ionic lock of the DRY motif, and the outward movement of TM6, opening the intercellular cavity for G protein coupling ( Figure 3 A). It is worth noting that both fentanyl and BU72 induced similar conformational changes of μOR, despite their different chemical scaffolds ( Figures 3 B–3D and S1 B).
Morphine, which shares a morphinan core with BU72, adopted a nearly identical binding mode as BU72 and induced similar conformational changes of μOR as BU72 and fentanyl, including that in TM3 and TM5/6/7 ( Figures 2 A and 3 A), indicating a common activation mechanism of these three agonists.
Fentanyl and its analogs, especially carfentanil, are key contributors of the opioid crisis. To understand the SAR of fentanyl derivatives, we docked carfentanil, lofentanil, sufentanil, remifentanil, and ohmefentanyl into the fentanyl-μOR structure. Consistent with their similar chemical scaffolds, fentanyl analogs share similar binding modes with that of fentanyl ( Figures 4 A–4G). Compared with fentanyl, carfentanil forms additional hydrophobic interactions with I298 6.51 , W320 7.35 , and I324 7.39 by the methoxycarbonyl group at the 4-position of the core piperidine ring ( Figure 4 C), which stabilize its binding to μOR and may explain its higher potency than fentanyl ( Swanson et al., 2017 67. Swanson, D.M. ∙ Hair, L.S. ∙ Strauch Rivers, S.R. ... Fatalities involving carfentanil and furanyl fentanyl: two case reports J. Anal. Toxicol. 2017; 41 :498-502 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sufentanil and remifentanil also make similar sets of hydrophobic interactions with TM6 and TM7, contributing to their higher affinity to μOR than fentanyl ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Mutations of I298A, W320A, and I324A showed much greater reduction of potencies of sufentanil and remifentanil than carfentanil, possibly due to their less extended hydrophobic interaction with the minor pocket compared with carfentanil ( Figure 4 H). Lofentanil is one of the most potent fentanyl derivatives with slightly higher affinity than carfentanil ( Mather, 1983 48. Mather, L.E. Clinical pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and its newer derivatives Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1983; 8 :422-446 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the docking model, lofentanil makes an extra CH - π interaction between the cis -methyl group of the piperidine ring and Y150 3.33 of μOR when compared with carfentanil ( Figure 4 D). Likewise, ohmefentanyl has an extra cis -methyl group in the piperidine ring like lofentanil and a hydroxyl group in the phenylethyl moiety, which could form additional CH - π and hydrogen bond interactions with Y150 3.33 and D149 3.32 , respectively, thus explaining its 20 times higher potency than fentanyl ( Figures 4 E and 4I). Mutations of D149 3.32 and Y150 3.33 to alanine reduced the potency of ohmefentanyl more than that of fentanyl ( Figures 4 I and 4J), supporting the binding pose of ohmefentanyl in the docking model.
As presented in Figures 1 and S1 , SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21 are μOR agonists with very low or even abolished β-arrestin recruitment activity, thus showing preference for G protein signaling ( Figures 1 B, S1 C, and S1D; Table S1 ). In contrast, fentanyl, morphine, and DAMGO display both G protein and arrestin recruitment activity. To understand the basis of the pharmacological profiles of these ligands, we obtained the structures of μOR bound with SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21. In our structures, all three ligands bind to μOR in OBP above W295 6.48 ( Figure 5 A), with their binding modes similar to each other. The benzimidazole ring of SR17018 and the methoxythiophen moiety of TRV130 and PZM21 bind to the minor pocket of μOR around TM2 and TM3 ( Figure 5 A). The chlorobenzene group of SR17018 points to TM6, whereas the oxaspiro moiety of TRV130 and the phenol group of PZM21 are oriented toward TM5 ( Figure 5 A). Similar to the n-aniline ring in fentanyl, the pyridine ring of TRV130 extends to the TMD core and forms close contacts with W295 6.48 , G327 7.42 , and Y328 7.43 , which is absent in the SR17018- and PZM21-bound structures ( Figure 5 A).
We also obtained a structure of the human μOR bound with peptide agonist DAMGO at 3.3 Å ( Figure S5 A). The overall structure of the human μOR bound to DAMGO is similar to the previous 3.5 Å structure of the mouse μOR bound with DAMGO ( Koehl et al., 2018 34. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the micro-opioid receptor-Gi protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ) (RMSD at 0.7 Å for the Cα atoms of receptor), but with differences in helix 8, ECL2, and the binding pose at the C terminus of DAMGO ( Figures S5 B–S5F). In our structure, DAMGO adopts a similar binding mode compared with fentanyl, mainly interacting with residues from TM2/3 and TM6/7, with the phenylmethyl region of DAMGO occupying the minor pocket of TM2/3, the same pocket occupied by the phenylethyl moiety of fentanyl ( Figures S5 G and S5H; Table S4 ).
We conducted comprehensive structural comparisons of all six μOR structures determined in this study. Interestingly, we observed that both SR17018 and PZM21 adopted poses away from TM7 and had no direct interactions with TM7 residues ( Figures 5 B, 5C, and S6 A–S6D). For SR17018, the pose of the piperidine ring moved about 1 Å away from TM7 to TM3 compared with that of fentanyl ( Figure 5 B). Alignment of PZM21 and DAMGO bound μOR structures showed that DAMGO generated additional interactions with TM7 through the D-alanine compared with PZM21 ( Figure 5 C). In addition to TM7, we also observed that both SR17018 and PZM21 adopt only weak hydrophobic interactions with TM6 residues ( Figures 5 C and S6 A–S6D). Molecular dynamics simulation results revealed that the binding of chlorobenzene of SR17018 is very flexible, suggesting the dynamic conformation of the chlorobenzene moiety near the TM6 region and unstable contact of SR17018 with TM6 of μOR ( Figures S6 E and S6F; Video S1 ). Since stable contacts with TM6 and TM7 were observed in μOR structures bound with DAMGO, fentanyl and morphine but not with SR17018 and PZM21, two ligands with nearly no arrestin recruitment activity ( Figures S6 E and S6F), we hypothesized that the reduced interactions of agonists with TM6 and TM7 might explain the pharmacology of SR17018 and PZM21. We thus mutated residues in the μOR OBP and tested the abilities of those mutants to activate G protein signaling and β-arrestin recruitment by fentanyl, morphine, and DAMGO, respectively. We found that mutations of residues near TM6 and TM7 showed more significant effects on β-arrestin signaling than those in TM2 and TM3 sides ( Table S5 ). For instance, mutations W295A from TM6 and W320A from TM7 had only minimum or partial effects on G protein signaling in cAMP inhibition and G protein recruitment, whereas they nearly abolished the β-arrestin recruitment induced by fentanyl, morphine, and DAMGO ( Figures 5 D–5F and S6 G–S6I; Tables S3–S5 ). Consistently, ligand interaction with Y312 7.35 of κOR, which corresponds to W320 7.35 of μOR, was demonstrated to be important for the β-arrestin signaling of κOR ( Che et al., 2018 11. Che, T. ∙ Majumdar, S. ∙ Zaidi, S.A. ... Structure of the nanobody-stabilized active state of the kappa Opioid receptor Cell. 2018; 172 :55-67.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, mutations of I298A eliminated β-arrestin recruitment while having partial or minimum effects on G protein signaling of fentanyl and morphine ( Figures 5 D–5F and S6 G–S6I; Tables S3–S5 ). Thus, stable interactions with TM6 and TM7 are necessary for β-arrestin signaling of μOR agonists.
Although TRV130 is a partial μOR agonist on G protein pathway, it maintains very weak β-arrestin signaling ability, with much lower efficacy than that of fentanyl. In our structures, TRV130 adopts a similar binding pose as SR17018 and PZM21, with the exception that the pyridine ring of TRV130 forms extra hydrophobic interactions with TM6/7 ( Figures 5 A, S6 A–S6D, S7 A, and S7B). Nevertheless, the binding modes of TRV130 and fentanyl could be well superimposed. The exception is that the pyridine ring of TRV130 tilted 35° toward TM2 relative to the n-aniline group of fentanyl ( Figure 5 A). This resulted in weaker hydrophobic interactions with TM6/7 than fentanyl, which may explain the weak β-arrestin signaling ability of TRV130 ( Figures 5 A and S7 A).
Agonists with different binding poses and pharmacological profiles may elicit distinct effects on the μOR intracellular part, which eventually leads to different coupling profiles of G protein and β-arrestin. To investigate the intracellular conformational variations of μOR upon binding of different opioid ligands, we conducted MD simulations of the μOR structures bound to SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21, three ligands with negligible β-arrestin activities. The opioid agonists with strong β-arrestin activity, such as fentanyl and DAMGO, were used as references. The tendency reflected that intracellular sides of TM6 and TM7-H8 in DAMGO and fentanyl systems moved toward the TM core, especially for the TM7-H8 junction, thus squeezed the intracellular cavity and decreased both solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and the volume of μOR intracellular pocket ( Figures 6 A and 6B). In contrast, the SASA and volume of μOR intracellular regions in SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21 bound systems were similar with those in μOR-G protein complexes (∼2,622 Å 2 and ∼1,456 Å 3 , respectively), inferring more exposure of pocket residues and different preference for G protein and β-arrestin ( Figure 6 A).
To further elucidate the relationship of the observed intracellular conformation differences with β-arrestin coupling, we constructed μOR-β-arrestin models based on MD structures and two different GPCR-β-arrestin structures (M 2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M 2 R)-β-arrestin1, Protein Data Bank [PDB]: 6U1N [ Staus et al., 2020 66. Staus, D.P. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of the M2 muscarinic receptor-beta-arrestin complex in a lipid nanodisc Nature. 2020; 579 :297-302 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ]; neurotensin receptor type 1 (NTSR1)-β-arrestin1, PDB: 6UP7 [ Huang et al., 2020 29. Huang, W. ∙ Masureel, M. ∙ Qu, Q. ... Structure of the neurotensin receptor 1 in complex with beta-arrestin 1 Nature. 2020; 579 :303-308 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ]) and investigate the compatibility of β-arrestin and conformations induced by different ligands. In fentanyl and DAMGO bound structure models, the inwardly moved TM6 and TM7-H8 of μOR led to much more contracted intracellular pockets and broader interaction interface areas with β-arrestin, facilitating the interactions between β-arrestin and μOR ( Figures 6 B and 6C). In contrast, in SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21 bound structure models, the intracellular TM6 and TM7-H8 parts of μOR tended to be away from the TM core, which decreased the μOR-β-arrestin interaction interface and weakened its ability for β-arrestin binding ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Our simulation results are consistent with the previous cryo-EM and MD studies, which suggested that the ligands preferential to β-arrestin signaling induced a narrower GPCR intracellular conformation suitable for stable β-arrestin coupling of β 1 adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) ( Lee et al., 2020b 38. Lee, Y. ∙ Warne, T. ∙ Nehmé, R. ... Molecular basis of beta-arrestin coupling to formoterol-bound beta1-adrenoceptor Nature. 2020; 583 :862-866 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wingler et al., 2019 76. Wingler, L.M. ∙ Elgeti, M. ∙ Hilger, D. ... Angiotensin analogs with divergent bias stabilize distinct receptor conformations Cell. 2019; 176 :468-478.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, our MD simulations showed that the μOR agonists with G protein signaling preference maintained the μOR intracellular pocket similar to that of μOR-G protein structure, whereas the ligands that are neutral toward G protein and β-arrestin signaling induced inward movement of intracellular TM6 and TM7-H8, leading to different intracellular conformations suitable for stable coupling of β-arrestin. Since the stable contact between ligands and μOR in TM6-TM7 leads to β-arrestin signaling, it can be inferred that extended interactions with TM6-TM7 may elicit inward movement of TM6 and TM7-H8 toward the TM core, leading to enhancement of β-arrestin coupling.
To further validate our discovery that ligand interaction with TM6/7 contributes to β-arrestin signaling of μOR, we rationally designed fentanyl derivatives to reduce TM6/7 interaction, with the aim to obtain μOR agonists with reduced/abolished β-arrestin signaling but relatively intact G protein activity. We use propyl or isopropyl groups to replace the n-aniline moiety in fentanyl, which form interactions with TM6/7. We also induced a cis -methyl group to the piperidine ring and a para-fluorine to the phenylethyl moiety of fentanyl, leading to two structurally similar compounds, FBD1 and FBD3 ( Figure 7 A). Both propyl and isopropyl substituents are smaller than the n-aniline moiety, weakening the interactions of designed drugs with TM6/7 of μOR. Indeed, both FBD1 and FBD3 showed great reduction in β-arrestin recruitment activities in reference to fentanyl. Especially, FBD3 showed nearly identical potency and efficiency as fentanyl in either cAMP inhibition or G i recruitment assays but had very limited β-arrestin recruitment activity ( Figures 7 B and 7C; Table S6 ). Molecular docking showed that FBD1 and FBD3 adopt similar binding poses in μOR OBP, with the exception that the propyl substituent of FBD3 inserted more deeply into the pocket compared with isopropyl, thereby leading to potential hydrophobic interactions with residues from TM6 and TM7, including W295 6.48 and Y328 7.43 ( Figures 7 D and 7E). Thus, these two ligands served as a “proof-of-concept” that the effect of ligand interaction with TM6/7 is critical in eliciting arrestin signaling by μOR and that reducing this interaction may result in ligand signaling preferentially via the G protein pathway ( Figure 7 F).

Section: Discussion

Fentanyl and its analogs constitute the main causes of the “opioid crisis”; however, the mode of their binding to μOR remains a challenging problem. We presented the structure of fentanyl bound μOR, which reveals a specific fentanyl binding mode and provides a rational model for understanding SAR of extensive fentanyl derivatives in the literature ( Burns et al., 2018 8. Burns, S.M. ∙ Cunningham, C.W. ∙ Mercer, S.L. DARK classics in chemical neuroscience: fentanyl ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2018; 9 :2428-2437 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; de Waal et al., 2020 16. de Waal, P.W. ∙ Shi, J. ∙ You, E. ... Molecular mechanisms of fentanyl mediated beta-arrestin biased signaling PLoS Comput. Biol. 2020; 16 :e1007394 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). The binding mode of fentanyl in our structure differs from the prior computational modeling studies ( Ricarte et al., 2021 57. Ricarte, A. ∙ Dalton, J.A.R. ∙ Giraldo, J. Structural assessment of agonist efficacy in the mu-opioid receptor: morphine and fentanyl elicit different activation patterns J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2021; 61 :1251-1274 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vo et al., 2021 72. Vo, Q.N. ∙ Mahinthichaichan, P. ∙ Shen, J. ... How mu-opioid receptor recognizes fentanyl Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :984 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), which did not identify the conformations of the tertiary amine group and phenylethyl moiety. In our structures, fentanyl adopts a distinct binding pose from those of morphine and DAMGO, with fentanyl forming extended interactions with the TMD core via the n-aniline ring, leading to a close contact with the toggle switch W 6.48 . In addition, fentanyl occupies an extra hydrophobic minor pocket near the TM2/3 region when compared with morphine, partially accounting for its higher potency than morphine.
Fentanyl and its derivatives, such as carfentanil, lofentanil, and sufentanil, share a similar chemical scaffold but differ from each other in side-chain substituents of piperidine core and n-aniline moiety. Consistently, the docking poses of these fentanyl derivatives exhibit high similarities with the fentanyl binding pose, with only differences in the interactions of distinct side-chain substituents with μOR. Given their structure similarity, the fentanyl derivatives might activate μOR by a similar mechanism as fentanyl, and our results provide a unified recognition pattern to design safer fentanyl analogs with better pharmacological profiles.
Our structures also provide the basis to explain the selectivity of fentanyl and its analogs for μOR over κOR and δOR, despite the only subtle differences in residue composition in the OBPs of these three ORs ( Figure S7 C). Alignment of fentanyl-bound μOR and active δOR structures indicates that residue differences at W320 7.35 L and N129 2.63 K from μOR to δOR contribute to its lower affinity to fentanyl, with W320 7.35 L leading to a much more open OBP and N129 2.63 K being energetically unfavorable to the binding of the hydrophobic phenylethyl moiety of fentanyl to δOR ( Figure S7 D). For κOR, the inward movements of TM2/6 and ECL1 from μOR to κOR induce a steric clash with fentanyl, with the side chain of Q115 2.60 in κOR pushing away the tertiary amine of fentanyl, explaining the lower potency of fentanyl toward κOR ( Figure S7 E).
Finally, understanding the molecular basis of preferential signaling mechanism has remained a challenging task. In this paper, we have reported six structures of μOR bound to three agonists of neutral signaling profile (morphine, fentanyl, and DAMGO) and three agonists with reduced β-arrestin signaling activities (SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21). Analyses of these structures have revealed that all neutral agonists form stable interactions with both sides of the OBP formed by TM2/3 and TM6/7, whereas the SR17018, TRV130, and PZM21 showed only preferred interactions with the TM2/3 side of pocket and no/weak interactions with TM6/7 ( Figure 7 F). In our experiments, mutations that interfere with TM6/7 interactions, especially residues W295 6.48 and W320 7.35 , largely diminished or abolished arrestin signaling, although they had limited influence on G protein activation by neutral agonists, including DAMGO. Our data are consistent with those of previous reports that corresponding TM7 residue Y 7.35 of κOR serves as structural determinant of β-arrestin activity ( Che et al., 2018 11. Che, T. ∙ Majumdar, S. ∙ Zaidi, S.A. ... Structure of the nanobody-stabilized active state of the kappa Opioid receptor Cell. 2018; 172 :55-67.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, residues in TM6/7 were demonstrated to be important for the preferred G protein activation of D1R ( Zhuang et al., 2021 83. Zhuang, Y. ∙ Xu, P. ∙ Mao, C. ... Structural insights into the human D1 and D2 dopamine receptor signaling complexes Cell. 2021; 184 :931-942.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5HT 2B R) ( McCorvy et al., 2018 51. McCorvy, J.D. ∙ Wacker, D. ∙ Wang, S. ... Structural determinants of 5-HT2B receptor activation and biased agonism Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :787-796 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) ( Xu et al., 2022 79. Xu, Z. ∙ Ikuta, T. ∙ Kawakami, K. ... Structural basis of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 activation and biased agonism Nat. Chem. Biol. 2022; 18 :281-288 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), and C-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) ( Shao et al., 2022 64. Shao, Z. ∙ Shen, Q. ∙ Yao, B. ... Identification and mechanism of G protein-biased ligands for chemokine receptor CCR1 Nat. Chem. Biol. 2022; 18 :264-271 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), similar to that of μOR revealed in this study. Thus, we proposed that the structural determinants required for arrestin signaling of μOR uncovered in this study may be compatible to other GPCRs, especially for the other ORs considering their high structural similarities ( Che et al., 2018 11. Che, T. ∙ Majumdar, S. ∙ Zaidi, S.A. ... Structure of the nanobody-stabilized active state of the kappa Opioid receptor Cell. 2018; 172 :55-67.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ), and phylogenetically close neighbors of μOR, like somatostatin and chemokine receptors ( Shao et al., 2022 64. Shao, Z. ∙ Shen, Q. ∙ Yao, B. ... Identification and mechanism of G protein-biased ligands for chemokine receptor CCR1 Nat. Chem. Biol. 2022; 18 :264-271 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, our results reveal molecular details of the structural factors important for arrestin activity of μOR and provide structural templates for the design of potent and potentially safer analgesia for pain treatment.
In this study, by determining the cryo-EM structures of μOR-G i complexes activated by ligands with different signal profiles, in combination with mutagenesis studies, we not only revealed the specific binding modes of morphine, fentanyl, and fentanyl derivatives but also uncovered the structural determinants, i.e., the TM6 and TM7 side of the OBP, that is critical for β-arrestin signaling of μOR. Ligands show less or no interaction with this motif display clearly reduced β-arrestin activation. Since these are G protein stabilized structures, the G protein certainly overwhelms the effects of the ligands on the intracellular side of the receptor. Thus, the signaling process leading to β-arrestin recruitment from the binding of fentanyl, morphine, and DAMGO remain to be answered. We also conducted extended investigations on the intracellular conformations of μOR induced by arrestin-attenuated and signaling-neutral agonists using molecular dynamic simulation of the determined structures without G protein. We found that the TM6 and TM7-helix 8 region of the receptor displayed different conformations while binding to arrestin-attenuated or signaling-neutral ligands, indicating that these motifs may contribute to β-arrestin signaling. The further modeling study suggested that the inward movement of TM6 and TM7-H8 regions in fentanyl and DAMGO bound μOR models led to much more contracted intracellular pockets to facilitate β-arrestin binding, in contrast to a wider open intracellular region induced by agonists with attenuated β-arrestin signaling. However, simulation modeling would not be accurate enough to study the subtle conformational dynamics in preferential signaling. It was also suggested that different μOR agonists, even with similar pharmacological profiles, induced divergent GPCR kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation states at the C terminus of the receptor, which was linked with their β-arrestin activities ( Gillis et al., 2020 22. Gillis, A. ∙ Gondin, A.B. ∙ Kliewer, A. ... Low intrinsic efficacy for G protein activation can explain the improved side effect profiles of new opioid agonists Sci. Signal. 2020; 13 :eaaz3140 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kliewer et al., 2019 33. Kliewer, A. ∙ Schmiedel, F. ∙ Sianati, S. ... Phosphorylation-deficient G-protein-biased mu-opioid receptors improve analgesia and diminish tolerance but worsen opioid side effects Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :367 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further studies, including structural studies on μOR complexed with GRK or β-arrestin, would be necessary to clarify how reduced TM6/7 interactions leads to different intracellular conformations, thus causing different coupling effects of μOR to G protein versus β-arrestin.

Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9, Expression systems) cells were used for recombinant protein expression while HEK293 cells (ATCC) were used for functional studies. The Sf9 cells were grown in ESF 921 medium (Expression systems) at 27°C, 120 rpm. HEK293 cells were grown in humidified 37°C incubator in condition of 5% CO 2 . The medium for human cell lines HEK293 was DMEM High-Glucose (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco).
The wild type (WT) human μOR was used for cryo-EM sample preparation of morphine, fentanyl, DAMGO, SR17018 and PZM21 bound μOR-G i complexes, for TRV130 bound μOR-G i complex, a commonly used point mutation F 3.41 W was induced to stabilize the signaling complex ( Heydenreich et al., 2015 25. Heydenreich, F.M. ∙ Vuckovic, Z. ∙ Matkovic, M. ... Stabilization of G protein-coupled receptors by point mutations Front. Pharmacol. 2015; 6 :82 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2021 78. Xu, P. ∙ Huang, S. ∙ Zhang, H. ... Structural insights into the lipid and ligand regulation of serotonin receptors Nature. 2021; 592 :469-473 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). For morphine, fentanyl, SR17018 and PZM21 bound μOR-G i complexes, the nucleotide coding sequence of μOR (1-388) was fused with an N-terminal FLAG tag followed by a TEV cleavage site, and a C-terminal His8 tag for purification of protein complexes ( Figure S1 A). The prolactin precursor sequence was inserted onto the N terminus as signaling peptide to assist anchoring μOR to the Sf9 insect cell membrane and elevate receptor expression level. For DAMGO and TRV130 bound μOR-G i complexes, we fused haemagglutinin (HA) signal peptide at the N-terminal of μOR (1-368), the C-terminus was followed by LgBiT with a TEV protease cleavage site and an oMBP-MBP tag to facilitate expression and purification ( Figure S1 A). The modified μOR sequences were all constructed into the pFastBac vector (ThermoFisher) for expression usage. Two dominant-negative mutations, G203A and A326S, were incorporated into the human G αi1 (G αi1 _2M) by site direct mutagenesis to decrease the binding of GDP/GTP and increase the stability of G protein ( Liu et al., 2016 41. Liu, P. ∙ Jia, M.Z. ∙ Zhou, X.E. ... The structural basis of the dominant negative phenotype of the Galphai1beta1gamma2 G203A/A326S heterotrimer Acta pharmacol. Sinica. 2016; 37 :1259-1272 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, a His8 tag was cloned to the N terminus of G β for two-step purification strategy usage. As for the μOR construct fused with LgBit, the G β fused with a His8 tag at N terminus as well as a 15 residues linker and the SmBiT tag at C terminus was used to link the LgBiT behind μOR in the later co-expression procedure ( Duan et al., 2020 19. Duan, J. ∙ Shen, D.D. ∙ Zhou, X.E. ... Cryo-EM structure of an activated VIP1 receptor-G protein complex revealed by a NanoBiT tethering strategy Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4121 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 A). All the three components of G i1 heterotrimer, human G αi1 _2M, rat His8-G β or His8-G β -SmBiT and bovine G γ , were constructed into the pFastBac vector (ThermoFisher), respectively.
The single chain antibody scFv16 was prepared in advance. For the expression of scFv16, the coding sequence of scFv16 was fused with a GP67 signaling peptide at the N terminus and a TEV cleavage site-His8 at the C terminus, and then cloned into the pFastBac vector (Thermo Fisher). Preparation of scFv16 stocks was conducted as previously described ( Maeda et al., 2018 43. Maeda, S. ∙ Koehl, A. ∙ Matile, H. ...

The baculoviruses of μOR, G αi1 _2M, G β1 and G γ2 were generated and amplified using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (ThermoFisher). The Sf9 cells were cultured in ESF 921 serum-free medium (Expression Systems). The four types of baculoviruses expressing μOR, G αi1 _2M, G β1 and G γ2 were co-expressed in Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) at the ratio of 1:1:1:1 when the cell density reached to 4 × 10 6 cells/mL. After incubation for 48 hours, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm (ThermoFisher, H12000) for 20 min and the cell precipitates were kept frozen at -80°C for further protein purification.
For the purification of μOR-G i complexes, cell pellets from 1 liter culture were thawed at room temperature and resuspended in low salt buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 10mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.3 mM TCEP, protease inhibitor cooktail (Bimake, 1 mL/ 100 mL suspension). The suspensions were treated with French Press and centrifugated at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The cell precipitates after centrifugation were collected and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5% glycerol, 0.3 mM TCEP, protease inhibitor cooktail (Bimake, 1 mL/ 100 mL suspension). The μOR-G i complexes were assembled on membrane by addition of synthesized compound ligands 10 μM morphine (Shenyang First Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), 10 μM fentanyl (Yuansi Technology Co., Ltd.), 20 μM SR17018 (TargetMol), 10 μM PZM21(Med Chem Express), 10 μM TRV130 (TargetMol) and peptide agonist 10 μM DAMGO (Med Chem Express), respectively. After incubating at room temperature for half an hour, the cell suspension was treated with apyrase (25 mU mL −1 , NEB), followed by incubation for another 1 hour at room temperature. Cell membranes in suspension was solubilized directly by adding 0.5% (w/v) lauryl maltose neopentylglycol (LMNG, Anatrace), 0.1% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate TRIS salt (CHS, Anatrace). After membrane solubilization for 3 hours at 4°C, the solubilized fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min and then incubated overnight at 4°C with pre-equilibrated Nickel-NTA resin (4 mL resin/1 L cell culture). After batch binding, the nickel resin with immobilized protein complex was manually loaded onto a gravity flow column. The nickel resin was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 0.3 mM TCEP, 0.05% LMNG (w/v), 0.01% CHS (w/v), 5 μM ligands and eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole.
For morphine, fentanyl, SR17018 and PZM21 bound μOR-G i complexes, the Ni-NTA eluate was further incubated by batch binding with 2 mL FLAG resin (Smart-Lifesciences) for 2 hours at 4°C. The FLAG resin embedded with protein complexes was then washed by 10 column volumes of detergent buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM TCEP, 0.0075% LMNG (w/v), 0.0025% GDN, 0.002% CHS (w/v), 5 μM ligands. Subsequently, the material bound to FLAG resin was then eluted in the same detergent buffer containing 200 μg/μL FLAG peptide. For DAMGO and TRV130 bound μOR-G i complexes, the first step Ni-NTA eluate was transferred to pre-equilibrated amylose resin (Smart-Lifesciences) and incubated for 3 hours at 4°C. After batch binding, the amylose resin was washed with 10 column volumes of detergent buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM TCEP, 0.0075% LMNG (w/v), 0.0025% GDN, 0.002% CHS (w/v), 5 μM ligands. The amylose resin with bound material was then suspended and treated with TEV protease (homemade) and 2mg scFv16 for 1 h at room temperature, the released protein in the flowthrough was then collected.
The eluted or released protein sample was concentrated to 0.5 mL using centrifugal filter units with a molecular weight cutoff at 100 KDa (Millipore, Sigma) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) or Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.00075% LMNG (w/v), 0.00025% GDN, 0.0002% CHS (w/v), 0.3 mM TCEP and 5 μM ligands. Fractions of main peak were collected and concentrated using 100 KDa centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Sigma) for the later electron microscopy experiments ( Figures S1 E–S1J).
When we purified the SR17018-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex sample by size exclusion chromatography, the retention volume of the protein complex indicated it to be dimer. The peak fraction of SR17018-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex was then subjected to negative staining analysis to check the dimeric state. 5 μL protein samples at concentration of 10ng/ μL were applied to glow-discharged carbon coated copper grids. After waiting for 60 s, the grids were blotted by filter paper. Subsequently, 5 μL of 1% uranyl formate was applied to the grid and blotted immediately. Then, another 5 μL of 1% uranyl formate was added to the grid and the protein sample was stained for 60 s. Data were acquired using a Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV.
For cryo-EM grid preparation, 3.0 μL morphine, fentanyl, DAMGO, SR17018, PZM21 and TRV130 bound μOR-G i -scFv16 complex at the concentration of 14.8 mg mL -1 , 12.5 mg mL -1 , 3.7 mg mL -1 , 8.1 mg mL -1 , 15.2 mg mL -1 , 9.8 mg mL -1 was applied individually to EM grids (Quantifoil, 300 mesh Au R1.2/1.3) that were glow-discharged for 50s in a Vitrobot chamber (FEI Vitrobot Mark IV). Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Vitrification was performed at 100% humidity and 4°C. The sample was blotted for 3s before plunge-freezing into liquid ethane. The prepared cryo-EM grids were stored in liquid nitrogen for screening and data collection usage.
Before data collection, grids were previously screened with a FEI 200 kV Arctica transmission electron microscope (TEM), the promising grids with evenly distributed particles and thin ice layer were transferred to a FEI 300 kV Titan Krios TEM for further data collection.

A total of 5,942 movies were collected. Data collection was performed using EPU with one exposure per hole on the grid squares.
Movie stacks were subjected to beam-induced motion correction using MotionCor 2.1 ( Zheng et al., 2017 81. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the datasets of morphine, fentanyl, SR17018 and TRV130 bound μOR-G i -scFv16 complexes, movie stack was aligned, dose weighted and binned by 2 to 1.071 Å per pixel. For the datasets of PZM21-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex, movie stacks were aligned, dose weighted and binned by 2 to 0.824 Å per pixel. Data processing was performed using RELION-3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 84. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated by Ctffind4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 60. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2867) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the SR17018-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex, the micrographs with resolution worse than 4.0 Å and micrographs imaged within the carbon area of grid squares were abandoned, producing 4,308 micrographs to do further data processing. About 2000 particles were manually selected and subjected to 2D classification. Representative averages were chosen as template for particle auto-picking. The auto-picking process produced 4,496,715 particles, which were subjected to reference-free 2D classifications to discard bad particles. Initial reference map models for 3D classification were generated by RELION using the representative 2D averages. The particles selected from 2D classification were subjected to 3D classifications. The first two rounds 3D classification results further indicated that the SR17018-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex existed as anti-parallel dimer, in which only one of the G protein heterotrimers showed clear density. Another 5 rounds 3D classifications were performed with a mask excluding the G protein heterotrimer with poor density. The 3D classifications resulting in a single well-defined subset with 355,281 particles. Further 3D refinement, CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing generated a density map with an indicated global resolution of 3.2 Å at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.143.
For the morphine, fentanyl, PZM21 and TRV130 bound μOR-G i -scFv16 complexes, the micrographs with resolution worse than 4.0 Å and micrographs imaged within the carbon area of grid squares were abandoned, producing 4,197 micrographs, 4,319 micrographs, 5,661 micrographs, 2,769 micrographs, respectively, to do further data processing. The 3D density map of SR17018-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex dimer low-pass filtered to 40 Å was chosen as reference map for auto-picking and further 3D classification processes for morphine, fentanyl and PZM21 bound μOR-G i -scFv16 datasets, while the 3D density map of CCK1R-CCK8-G i (EMDB ID EMD-31387) ( Liu et al., 2021 42. Liu, Q. ∙ Yang, D. ∙ Zhuang, Y. ... Ligand recognition and G-protein coupling selectivity of cholecystokinin A receptor Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; 17 :1238-1244 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) low-pass filtered to 40 Å was chosen as reference map for auto-picking and further 3D classification for TRV130-μOR-G i -scFv16 dataset. The 2D and 3D classifications were performed on a binned dataset with a pixel size of 2.142 Å. The auto-picking process produced 5,125,620 particles for morphine-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex, 4,197,617 particles for fentanyl-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex, 5,674,868 particles for PZM21-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex and 2,256,278 particles for TRV130-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex, which were subjected to reference-free 2D classifications to discard bad particles. Particles selected from 2D classification were then subjected to several rounds 3D classifications. Similar anti- parallel dimer conformations as SR17018-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex were observed in morphine, fentanyl and PZM21 bound μOR-G i -scFv16 datasets, while the TRV130-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex existed as stable monomer. As to morphine, fentanyl and PZM21 bound μOR-G i -scFv16 particles, 3D classifications were performed with a mask excluding one of the G protein heterotrimers with poor density. The final 3D classifications lead to a single well-defined subset with 382,346 particles for morphine-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex, a single well-defined subset with 291,861 particles for fentanyl-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex and two well-defined subsets with 150,254 particles for PZM21-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex. As for TRV130-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex. The final 3D classifications lead to a single well-defined subset with 300,448 particles. Further 3D refinement, CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing generated a density map with indicated global resolutions of 3.2 Å, 3.3 Å, 2.8 Å and 3.2 Å for morphine, fentanyl, PZM21 and TRV130 bound μOR-G i -scFv16 complexes, respectively. The resolutions were estimated by applying a soft mask around the protein densities with the FSC 0.143 criteria. A map generated by 3D refinement was subsequent post-processed in DeepEMhancer ( Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2021 61. Sanchez-Garcia, R. ∙ Gomez-Blanco, J. ∙ Cuervo, A. ... DeepEMhancer: a deep learning solution for cryo-EM volume post-processing Commun. Biol. 2021; 4 :874 Crossref Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ) for fentanyl-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex.
For DAMGO-μOR-G i -scFv16 complex, dose-fractionated image stacks were subjected to beam-induced motion correction using MotionCor2.1 ( Zheng et al., 2017 81. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ). A sum of all frames, filtered according to the exposure dose, in each image stack was used for further processing. Contrast transfer function parameters for each micrograph were determined by Gctf v1.06 ( Zhang, 2016 80. Zhang, K. Gctf: real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle selection, 2D and 3D classifications were performed on a binned dataset with a pixel size of 2.142 Å using RELION-3.1.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 84. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Auto-picking yielded 3,984,244 particle projections that were subjected to reference-free 2D classification to discard false positive particles or particles categorized in poorly defined classes, producing 1,729,374 particle projections for further processing. This subset of particle projections was subjected to a round of maximum-likelihood-based 3D classifications with a pixel size of 2.142 Å, resulting in one well-defined subset. Further 3D classifications with mask on the complex produced one good subset of 602,466 particles, which were subjected to another round of 3D classifications with mask on the receptor. A selected subset containing 305,004 projections was then subjected to 3D refinement and Bayesian polishing with a pixel size of 1.071 Å. After the last round of refinement, the final map has an indicated global resolution of 3.3 Å at a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143.
Local resolution map was calculated using ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 35. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1315) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surface coloring of the density map was performed using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 53. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data processing maps were generated using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 53. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ChimeraX ( Pettersen et al., 2021 54. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: structure visualization for researchers, educators, and developers Protein Sci. 2021; 30 :70-82 Crossref Scopus (3755) PubMed Google Scholar ). In all the solved μOR-G i complexes, no clear densities were observed in the N-terminal and C-terminal tails of μOR, which was similar to most reported GPCR-G protein complexes. Interestingly, several putative lipids densities were found surrounding the μOR-G i homodimer packing interface of μOR, which may play important role in stabilizing the conformation of the interaction interface.
The cryo-EM structure of mouse DAMGO-μOR-G i complex (PDB code: 6DDE) was used as initial model for model rebuilding and refinement against the EM density map. The model was first fitted as a rigid body into the cryo-EM density maps using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 53. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, the models were refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... Phenix: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18501) PubMed Google Scholar ) and manually adjusted and rebuilt in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 20. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25430) PubMed Google Scholar ). All ligands were created using ChemSketch (ACD/ChemSketch, version 2018.2.1, Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada, www.acdlabs.com , 2018), and manually adjusted based on electron density maps in Coot and refined together with the protein complexes in Phenix. The final complex models were validated by Molprobity ( Chen et al., 2010 12. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cryo-EM data collection, image processing and structure refinement statistics are listed in the Table S2 . Figures showing structural models and detailed structural information were prepared by PyMol 2.4.2 ( https://pymol.org/2/ ). The maximum distance cutoffs for polar interactions and hydrophobic interactions were set at 3.5-Å and 4.5-Å, respectively.
Cell-surface expression for WT μOR and mutants was monitored by a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assay. In brief, HEK293 cells expressing HA-tagged μOR were harvested twenty-four hours after transfection. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-HA-FITC antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:200 for 20 min at 4°C, and then a 9-fold excess of PBS was added to cells. Finally, the surface expression of μOR was monitored by detecting the fluorescent intensity of FITC with Guava easyCyte 8HT. The FACS data were analyzed by Guava software 2.1.
For detecting G i signaling of μOR, HEK293 cells expressing WT or mutant μOR were harvested and resuspended in DMEM containing 500 μM IBMX at a density of 2 ×10 5 cells/mL. Cells were then plated onto 384-well assay plates at 1000 cells/ 5 μL/ well. Another 5 μL buffer containing 1 μM Forskolin and various concentrations of test compounds were added to the cells. After incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes, intracellular cAMP level was tested by a LANCE Ultra cAMP kit (PerkinElmer, TRF0264) and EnVision multiplate reader according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The recruitment of G αi / o / β-arrestin 2 to μOR was measured using the Promega NanoBiT Protein-Protein Interaction System. In brief, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding LgBiT-miniG α / LgBiT-β arrestin 2 and μOR -SmBiT at the ratio of 1:1. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested and resuspended in phenol red-free DMEM at a density of 1.2 ×10 6 cells/mL.

The fentanyl-μOR complex was firstly prepared in Schrödinger, Maestro. In the preparation, hydrogens were added to systems with a pH of 7, and a restrained minimization process were then conducted to exclude conflicts. Based on the minimized structure, fentanyl derivatives, including carfentanil, lofentanil, ohmefentanyl, remifentanil and sufentanil, as well as the designed G protein-preferred fentanyl analogs FBD1 and FBD3, were docked to the corresponding pocket. In particular, the initial conformations of ligands were generated by triangle matcher with London dG scoring. Next, refinement was employed with a rigid receptor under GBVI/WSA dG scoring to produce the output structure.
The ligand-bound complex structures of μOR were used to construct six molecular dynamics simulation systems including fentanyl, morphine, DAMGO, TRV130, PZM21 and SR17018, respectively. We used CHARMM-GUI server to insert complex structures to a palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membrane, then solved with TIP3P water and 0.15 mol L −1 KCl to establish simulation systems ( Jo et al., 2017 30.

The following simulation processes were finished on Amber20. Firstly, the systems were minimized for solvents and then for all atoms. Next, all of them were heated to 300 K in 300 ps and equilibrated for 700 ps under NVT conditions with 10 kcal mol −1 Å −2 restraint on proteins and lipids. Then, systems underwent 3×500 ns independent production runs under NPT condition with a timestep of 2 fs. During simulations, the temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 atm) were controlled by Langevin thermostat and Berendsen barostat, respectively. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated by Particle mesh Ewald algorithm and a cutoff of 10 Å was employed for short-range electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to restrain the bond with hydrogens for covalent bonds containing hydrogen.
The analyses of simulation trajectories were finished by CPPTRAJ ( Roe and Cheatham, 2013 59. Roe, D.R. ∙ Cheatham, 3rd, T.E. PTRAJ and CPPTRAJ: software for processing and analysis of Molecular Dynamics trajectory data J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 2013; 9 :3084-3095 Crossref Scopus (4766) PubMed Google Scholar ). In detail, to calculate the SASA, the residues within 5 Å of G protein in fentanyl-μOR-G protein structure were picked as G protein pocket residues. Then, their SASAs were calculated by ‘surf’ command in CPPTRAJ using the linear combination of pairwise overlaps method (LCPO) ( Weiser et al., 1999 75. Weiser, J. ∙ Shenkin, P.S. ∙ Still, W.C. Approximate atomic surfaces from linear combinations of pairwise overlaps (LCPO) J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20 :217-230 Crossref Scopus (1019) Google Scholar ). The pocket volumes were calculated by MDpocket ( Schmidtke et al., 2011 63. Schmidtke, P. ∙ Bidon-Chanal, A. ∙ Luque, F.J. ... MDpocket: open-source cavity detection and characterization on molecular dynamics trajectories Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :3276-3285 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). In specific distance ranges (fentanyl and DAMGO: 6-8 Å, SR17018, TRV130, PZM21: 10-14 Å), the structure with the smallest C-alpha RMSD with other structures was extracted as the representative structure for the range via hieragglo algorithm, ‘cluster’ command in CPPTRAJ.
The contact profile was calculated by the ‘nativecontacts’ command in CPPTRAJ. For each snapshot in every system, the distance between every heavy atom in ligand and receptor was calculated. If the distance is smaller than 4 Å in one snapshot between an atom pair, the corresponding residue was determined to have contact with ligand in this snapshot. For the whole trajectories, if the residue has contacts with ligand in more than 40 % of all the time, the residue was marked as one with stable contacts and shown as sticks in Figure S6 F.
M 2 R-β-arrestin1 (PDB ID: 6U1N) and NTSR1-β-arrestin1 (PDB ID: 6UP7) were used for the construction of μOR-β-arrestin model 1 and model 2, respectively. During the process, M 2 R and NTSR1 were firstly aligned to the representative structures. Then, μOR and β-arrestin structures were extracted from the complex for minimization with a 3.0 Å RMSD restraint on non-hydrogen atoms. The interface areas were calculated by averaging the SASA covered by β-arrestin in μOR and the SASA covered by μOR in β-arrestin.
Structural figures were prepared in in UCSF Chimera ( https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/ ), Chimera X ( https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/ ) and PyMOL ( https://pymol.org/2/ ).
For cAMP accumulation assays and β-arrestin2 recruitment assays, results were analyzed using the sigmoidal log (agonist) versus dose response function built into GraphPad Prism software 8.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Concentration-response curves were evaluated with a three-parameter logistic equation. The pEC 50 and Span values were calculated for individual experiments using “log (agonist) vs. response (three parameters)” function in GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. Average E max and basal values for assays were determined from the highest and lowest concentrations of the respective compound. The significance was determined with two-side, one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD test, and ∗ P < 0.05; ∗∗ P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗ P < 0.001 vs. wild-type (WT) was considered statistically significant. For surface expression levels of WT μOR and its mutants, values were normalized to wild-type receptor and graphed as a percentage of wild-type using GraphPad Prism 8.0. All the data in the figures and tables are presented as means ± SEM with the number of biological and technical replicates indicated in the figure and table legends.
