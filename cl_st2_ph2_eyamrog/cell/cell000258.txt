Title: Histone H3.3G34-Mutant Interneuron Progenitors Co-opt PDGFRA for Gliomagenesis


Abstract: Summary

Histone H3.3 glycine 34 to arginine/valine (G34R/V) mutations drive deadly gliomas and show exquisite regional and temporal specificity, suggesting a developmental context permissive to their effects. Here we show that 50% of G34R/V tumors (n = 95) bear activating PDGFRA mutations that display strong selection pressure at recurrence. Although considered gliomas, G34R/V tumors actually arise in GSX2 / DLX -expressing interneuron progenitors, where G34R/V mutations impair neuronal differentiation. The lineage of origin may facilitate PDGFRA co-option through a chromatin loop connecting PDGFRA to GSX2 regulatory elements, promoting PDGFRA overexpression and mutation. At the single-cell level, G34R/V tumors harbor dual neuronal/astroglial identity and lack oligodendroglial programs, actively repressed by GSX2/DLX -mediated cell fate specification. G34R/V may become dispensable for tumor maintenance, whereas mutant- PDGFRA is potently oncogenic. Collectively, our results open novel research avenues in deadly tumors. G34R/V gliomas are neuronal malignancies where interneuron progenitors are stalled in differentiation by G34R/V mutations and malignant gliogenesis is promoted by co-option of a potentially targetable pathway, PDGFRA signaling.

Section: Introduction

High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are deadly primary brain tumors and a leading cause of mortality in children and young adults. These tumors frequently harbor somatic mutations in genes encoding histone 3 (H3) variants or epigenetic modifiers with remarkable neuroanatomical and age specificity ( Fontebasso et al., 2014b 22.

HGGs in adolescents and young adults (12–35 years old) primarily occur in cerebral hemispheric lobes, and a large number are considered epigenetic disorders ( Fontebasso et al., 2013 20.

More than 30% of these HGGs bear heterozygous mutations in the non-canonical H3.3 variant, leading to glycine 34 to arginine or valine (G34R/V) amino acid substitutions ( Fontebasso et al., 2014b 22.

G34R/V tumors are understudied and likely underestimated because their unique histopathological heterogeneity, with dual neuronal-glial compartments present at variable degrees, leads to misdiagnosis. Indeed, close to 30% of central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS-PNETs), a now obsolete entity of mixed high-grade neuronal tumors ( Sturm et al., 2016 90.

Histologically distinct neuroepithelial tumors with histone 3 G34 mutation are molecularly similar and comprise a single nosologic entity Acta Neuropathol. 2016; 131 :137-146 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the molecular level, on the other hand, G34R/V HGGs show unifying features; they almost invariably carry mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked ( ATRX ) and tumor protein p53 ( TP53 ) ( Korshunov et al., 2016 36.

In contrast to lysine 27 to methionine (K27M) or lysine 36 to methionine (K36M) mutations that affect canonical H3.1/2 and H3.3 variants, G34R/V occur exclusively on the non-canonical H3.3 and have been suggested to act in cis , with the bulky amino acid replacement preventing post-translational modification of the neighboring H3.3K36 residue ( Lewis et al., 2013 44.

Limited information exists regarding oncogenic or developmental pathways in these tumors, hampering their modeling and development of therapeutic strategies. Compiling comprehensive cohorts to study their molecular landscape has been challenging because this age group spans pediatric and adult care and has a high rate of misdiagnosis. To address this knowledge gap, we assembled the largest cohort of G34R/V HGG tumors to date (n = 95), including primary/relapse pairs; comprehensively profiled them at the genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic (bulk and single-cell) levels; and developed in vitro and in vivo models. We delineate the unique molecular characteristics of G34R/V tumors, define their developmental origins, characterize inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, and uncover specific vulnerabilities that may be amenable to targeted therapies in this deadly cancer type.

Section: Results

To define the genetic landscape of G34R/V HGGs, we assembled a multi-institutional cohort of G34R (72 at diagnosis, 8 recurrences) and G34V tumors (9 at diagnosis, 6 recurrences). We compared G34R/V mutation profiles with midline K27M HGGs and with the other hemispheric HGG subgroups occurring in children or adults younger than 50 years; namely, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 )- and/or SET domain containing 2 ( SETD2 ) mutant HGGs or tumors wild-type for these mutations ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ). In addition to the known genetic alterations in TP53 and ATRX (95% and 84%, respectively), we observed a specific, previously unappreciated high frequency of mutations in platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (( PDGFRA ) in G34R/V HGGs (46 of 95) that also showed a high level of PDGFRA expression ( Figure S1 A). The high frequency at diagnosis (44%) was enriched further at recurrence (81%, p = 0.02, Fisher’s exact test). Co-occurrence of G34R/V and PDGFRA mutations was 7- to 8-fold higher than in any other subgroup, where the highest observed PDGFRA MUT frequency was 7% (p = 2.8E–55, chi-square test). No other recurrent mutations (frequency >10%) were identified beyond PDGFRA ( Figure S1 B). In contrast to K27M HGGs ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012 32. Khuong-Quang, D.A. ∙ Buczkowicz, P. ∙ Rakopoulos, P. ...

Wu, G. ∙ Diaz, A.K. ∙ Paugh, B.S. ... The genomic landscape of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and pediatric non-brainstem high-grade glioma Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :444-450 Crossref Scopus (559) PubMed Google Scholar ), amplification of PDGFRA was relatively rare in G34R/V tumors (6 of 47, 13%) and similar in proportion to other hemispheric HGG subgroups, including IDH1 mutant and IDH1/H3 wild type (p = 0.64, chi-square test).
PDGFRA is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains. Within G34R/V HGGs, 85% of PDGFRA mutations occurred in the second to fourth extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains ( Figure 1 B). In contrast, we rarely observed the D842V/Y mutations affecting an autoinhibition site in the kinase domain (n = 2), prevalent and well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( Heinrich et al., 2003 27. Heinrich, M.C. ∙ Corless, C.L. ∙ Demetri, G.D. ... Kinase mutations and imatinib response in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21 :4342-4349 Crossref Scopus (1863) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most of these extracellular mutations have mainly been reported in brain tumors, particularly pediatric gliomas ( Paugh et al., 2013 68. Paugh, B.S. ∙ Zhu, X. ∙ Qu, C. ... Novel oncogenic PDGFRA mutations in pediatric high-grade gliomas Cancer Res. 2013; 73 :6219-6229 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), and are presumed to be activating ( Ip et al., 2018 29. Ip, C.K.M. ∙ Ng, P.K.S. ∙ Jeong, K.J. ... Neomorphic PDGFRA extracellular domain driver mutations are resistant to PDGFRA targeted therapies Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4583 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paugh et al., 2013 68. Paugh, B.S. ∙ Zhu, X. ∙ Qu, C. ... Novel oncogenic PDGFRA mutations in pediatric high-grade gliomas Cancer Res. 2013; 73 :6219-6229 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Table S1 ). We performed in silico modeling of two extracellular mutations ( Figure S1 C): cysteine 235 to tyrosine/phenylalanine (C235Y/F), the most prevalent in our cohort (n = 15), and lysine 385 to methionine (K385M), which has been reported recently as the sole recurrent mutation in rare myxoid glioneuronal tumors ( Solomon, 2018 87. Solomon, D.A. ∙ Korshunov, A. ∙ Sill, M. ... Myxoid glioneuronal tumor of the septum pellucidum and lateral ventricle is defined by a recurrent PDGFRA p.K385 mutation and DNT-like methylation profile Acta Neuropathologica. 2018; Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ). Both mutations were predicted to lead to receptor dimerization and constitutive activation, analogous to the well-characterized Y288C mutation ( Ip et al., 2018 29. Ip, C.K.M. ∙ Ng, P.K.S. ∙ Jeong, K.J. ... Neomorphic PDGFRA extracellular domain driver mutations are resistant to PDGFRA targeted therapies Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4583 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we observed marked ERK phosphorylation, indicating downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activation in G34R/V- PDGFRA MUT tumors, whereas PDGFRA WT tumors showed limited ERK phosphorylation in cells not expressing this RTK ( Figure 1 C). Moreover, in one available primary/relapsed pair where the tumor acquired PDGFRA K385M at relapse, ERK phosphorylation was only present at relapse ( Figure 1 C). Collectively, these results suggest that PDGFRA mutations in G34R/V tumors promote constitutive activation of this RTK and its downstream signaling pathways.
The high co-occurrence of PDGFRA mutations with G34R/V suggests G34R/V context dependency, likely linked to development, as demonstrated recently for several related entities ( Jessa et al., 2019 30. Jessa, S. ∙ Blanchet-Cohen, A. ∙ Krug, B. ... Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors Nat.

Childhood cerebellar tumours mirror conserved fetal transcriptional programs Nature. 2019; 572 :67-73 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). To define the cellular lineage at the origin of G34R/V tumors, we first assessed cell type-specific signatures derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlases of forebrain development ( Jessa et al., 2019 30. Jessa, S. ∙ Blanchet-Cohen, A. ∙ Krug, B. ... Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors Nat.

Single-cell genomics identifies cell type-specific molecular changes in autism Science. 2019; 364 :685-689 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ) using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Compared with other HGG entities, transcriptomes of G34R/V gliomas showed strong enrichment of the cortical interneuron lineage, including radial glia, neuronal progenitor, and interneuron gene programs, and were depleted of excitatory neuron and oligodendroglial signatures ( Figure 2 A; Figures S2 A and S2B; Table S2 ). Consistent with the presence of a neuronal compartment, astrocyte gene programs were decreased relative to other gliomas but still highly enriched compared with non-glioma entities, such as high-grade neuroepithelial tumors with BCL6 co-repressor ( B COR ) alteration (HGNET-BCOR) ( Figure S2 C). Importantly, G34R/V tumors showed enrichment of prenatal but not postnatal interneuron signatures.
Cortical interneurons are generated during embryonic development in transient progenitor domains of the ventral telencephalon, called ganglionic eminences (GEs) ( Hansen et al., 2013 24. Hansen, D.V. ∙ Lui, J.H. ∙ Flandin, P. ... Non-epithelial stem cells and cortical interneuron production in the human ganglionic eminences Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :1576-1587 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2013 54. Ma, T. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Wang, L. ... Subcortical origins of human and monkey neocortical interneurons Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :1588-1597 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 B). A network of transcription factors (TFs), including GS homeobox 2 ( GSX2 ) and distal-less homeobox1/2 ( DLX1/2 ), patterns these domains to specify interneuron fate. GSX2 is expressed throughout the GEs but most highly in the lateral and caudal GEs, where it acts upstream of DLX1/2. All three factors ( GSX2 and DLX1/2 ) are required for interneuron specification and repression of oligodendroglial fate ( Chapman et al., 2013 8. Chapman, H. ∙ Waclaw, R.R. ∙ Pei, Z. ...

Dlx1 and Dlx2 control neuronal versus oligodendroglial cell fate acquisition in the developing forebrain Neuron. 2007; 55 :417-433 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Postnatally, a Gsx2 + neural stem cell niche derived from its GE counterpart and regulated by a similar TF hierarchy persists in the murine brain, within the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) ( Chapman et al., 2018 9. Chapman, H. ∙ Riesenberg, A. ∙ Ehrman, L.A. ... Gsx transcription factors control neuronal versus glial specification in ventricular zone progenitors of the mouse lateral ganglionic eminence Dev.

Gsx2 controls region-specific activation of neural stem cells and injury-induced neurogenesis in the adult subventricular zone Genes Dev. 2013; 27 :1272-1287 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus extended our analysis to include two recently reported scRNA-seq SVZ datasets ( Anderson et al., 2020 1. Anderson, A.G. ∙ Kulkarni, A. ∙ Harper, M. ...

Consistent with GSEA results, G34R/V HGGs significantly upregulated GSX2 ; the human radial glia marker MOXD1 ( Pollen et al., 2015 70. Pollen, A.A. ∙ Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Chen, J. ... Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development Cell. 2015; 163 :55-67 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ); interneuron TFs, including DLX1/2 ( Figure 2 D; Figure S2 E); and the interneuron markers GAD2 , SCGN , NPY , and CALB2 ( Ma et al., 2013 54. Ma, T. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Wang, L. ... Subcortical origins of human and monkey neocortical interneurons Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :1588-1597 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raju et al., 2018 74. Raju, C.S. ∙ Spatazza, J. ∙ Stanco, A. ... Secretagogin is Expressed by Developing Neocortical GABAergic Neurons in Humans but not Mice and Increases Neurite Arbor Size and Complexity Cereb. Cortex. 2018; 28 :1946-1958 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, they lacked expression of TFs specifying excitatory neurons, such as EOMES and NEUROD2 ( Figure S2 E). This transcriptional profile was unique to G34R/V tumors; expression of forebrain interneuron TFs and gene signatures was absent not only in midline K27M tumors but also in other hemispheric HGGs. Thus, we conclude that, at the transcriptional level, G34R/V HGGs resemble GSX2/DLX+ progenitors of the interneuron lineage.
We next assessed epigenomic profiles of G34R/V tumors, which were also consistent with an interneuron origin. GSX2 and DLX1/2 displayed an active chromatin conformation, enriched for the activating histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) mark and lacking the repressive histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) mark ( Figure 2 E; Table S3 ). On the other hand, gene sets enriched for H3K27me3 were related to neuronal synapse-, axon-, and ion channel-associated functions (e.g., NTRK2 , NXPH1 , and CHRNA4 ) ( Figure S2 F). The H3K27me3 and H3K27ac marks were absent from the promoter of the oligodendrocyte lineage factor OLIG2 in G34R/V gliomas, in keeping with previous data showing it to be silenced through DNA methylation in this entity ( Sturm et al., 2012 89. Sturm, D. ∙ Witt, H. ∙ Hovestadt, V. ... Hotspot mutations in H3F3A and IDH1 define distinct epigenetic and biological subgroups of glioblastoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 22 :425-437 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1095) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 E). Furthermore, G34R/V HGGs lacked activation of a core module of TFs necessary for oligodendrocyte specification ( Figure S2 G).
Finally, to confirm the match to immature interneuron progenitors, we extracted genes driving transcriptional enrichment of signatures in G34R/V tumors as well as genes displaying differential H3K27ac/me3 deposition and profiled their expression along a normal interneuron differentiation trajectory ( Figure 2 F). G34R/V-upregulated genes were primarily expressed in interneuron progenitors. Conversely, genes downregulated and H3K27me3 enriched in G34R/V peaked in expression late in normal interneuron maturation. The transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of G34R/V HGGs indicate that they arise within ventrally derived progenitors committed to the interneuron lineage, which appear to be restricted from progressing to a mature neuronal state.
H3K27me3 patterns in G34R/V gliomas may reflect their developmental origin or derive from G34R/V-mediated epigenetic dysregulation. H3.3G34R/V substitutions have been shown previously to impair the catalytic deposition of histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36me3) by SETD2 ( Lewis et al., 2013 44. Lewis, P.W. ∙ Müller, M.M. ∙ Koletsky, M.S. ... Inhibition of PRC2 activity by a gain-of-function H3 mutation found in pediatric glioblastoma Science. 2013; 340 :857-861 Crossref Scopus (713) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 107. Zhang, Y. ∙ Shan, C.M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Molecular basis for the role of oncogenic histone mutations in modulating H3K36 methylation Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :43906 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), a mark coupled to active transcription and known to directly antagonize H3K27 methylation ( Schmitges et al., 2011 81. Schmitges, F.W. ∙ Prusty, A.B. ∙ Faty, M. ... Histone methylation by PRC2 is inhibited by active chromatin marks Mol. Cell. 2011; 42 :330-341 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of histones extracted from patient-derived cell lines, we observed H3K36me3 loss coupled to reciprocal gain of H3K27me3 specifically on H3.3G34R/V mutant histone peptides ( Figure S3 A), confirming the cis effect of these mutations. At the genome-wide level, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed H3K27me3 deposition to be significantly enriched at a large number of genic promoters (n = 3,901) in G34R/V HGGs compared with non-G34R/V cortical HGGs ( Figure S3 B). We observed specific H3K27me3 enrichment at promoters of several genes encoding brain-specific proteins implicated in neuronal function in G34R/V samples. This gain in H3K27me3 contrasted with the relatively balanced changes observed in H3K27ac deposition, where only ∼100 promoters showed differential enrichment in G34R/V ( Figure S3 C).
To determine whether H3K27me3 enrichment is a direct consequence of the G34R/V oncohistone, we targeted the mutation for removal in the HSJD-GBM002 ( H3F3A G34R ) cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 ( Figure S3 D). There were limited differences in histone marks by ChIP-seq or the transcriptome by RNA-seq between G34R and edited clones ( Tables S2 and S3 ; Figures S3 E–S3G), suggesting that the global epigenomic landscape is not actively maintained by G34R/V mutant histones in transformed cells. Expression of the DLX family of interneuron TFs was maintained in edited and unedited lines ( Figure 3 A, top row), suggesting that specification of the interneuron transcriptional program in G34R/V gliomas reflects their lineage of origin. Notably, when assessing genomic bins showing the greatest H3K36me3 loss in G34R, these concurrently displayed increased polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)SUZ12/H3K27me3 enrichment and decreased transcriptional activity, in keeping with the presumed effect of G34R/V on these marks ( Figure 3 B; Figures S3 E–S3G). When edited clones were subjected to serum differentiation, we observed upregulation of DLX1 but, notably, also of DLX5 , which is normally induced later in interneuron differentiation ( Figure 3 A, bottom row). These edited clones showed enrichment of interneuron gene programs and depletion of radial glia cell gene signatures, consistent with further progression into neuronal differentiation upon removal of the mutation ( Figure 3 C).
Finally, to confirm the G34R-mediated epigenomic and transcriptomic effects in vivo , we utilized a previously described in utero electroporation (IUE) murine model ( Pathania et al., 2017 67. Pathania, M. ∙ De Jay, N. ∙ Maestro, N. ... H3.3 K27M Cooperates with Trp53 Loss and PDGFRA Gain in Mouse Embryonic Neural Progenitor Cells to Induce Invasive High-Grade Gliomas Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :684-700.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) neocortices were electroporated with exogenous empty vector (EV), H3.3 wild type (WT), or H3.3G34R in combination with Pdgfra WT, Atrx short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and short-guide RNA (sgRNA) for Trp53 , along with episomal vectors for Cas9 and pBase. We profiled ex-vivo -expanded neural precursor cells derived from sorted GFP+TdTomato+ cells after 72 h and in mice older than 1 year ( Figure S4 A). Minimal changes were observed 72 h after electroporation, whereas marked accumulation of H3K27me3 at genic promoters was observed in adult G34R-expressing cells. Importantly, and consistent with H3K27me3 patterns in human G34R/V tumors and CRISPR lines, the IUE cells also exhibited G34R-specific H3K27me3 retention at genic promoters such as Jph4 and Foxp2 , a TF expressed in mature forebrain neurons ( Figures S4 B and S4C). By leveraging model systems to decouple the effect of G34 mutations from existing lineage of origin programs, we conclude that G34R/V oncohistones may directly impede terminal neuronal differentiation through aberrant H3K27me3 retention at specific neuronal maturation loci.
We next investigated the mechanism underlying the association of G34R/V interneuron progenitor programs with PDGFRA . The PDGFRA gene is located immediately adjacent to the interneuron TF GSX2 . In G34R/V tumors and cell lines, PDGFRA expression was positively correlated with GSX2 (R 2 = 0.48, p = 0.0002; Figure S5 A), whereas in the other subtypes, correlation was lower (R 2 = 0.2), and GSX2 was very lowly expressed ( Figure S1 A). This transcriptional coupling observed in G34R/V tumors is likely aberrant because PDGFRA and GSX2 are normally expressed in distinct cell lineages ( Figure 3 D; Figure S5 B), suggesting that PDGFRA hijacks surrounding cis -regulatory regions to promote its ectopic expression in G34R/V HGGs.
To determine whether epigenetic dysregulation underlies this transcriptional coupling, we first examined H3K27ac profiles in G34R/V tumors. Indeed, the top genomic bins showing differential H3K27ac deposition in G34R/V included the PDGFRA promoter as well as a distal enhancer element hs687 , located near GSX2 / PDGFRA ( Visel et al., 2013 97. Visel, A. ∙ Taher, L. ∙ Girgis, H. ... A high-resolution enhancer atlas of the developing telencephalon Cell. 2013; 152 :895-908 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 E). This VISTA-validated enhancer has been shown to drive reporter expression in the lateral GE of the embryonal telencephalon, coincident with Gsx2 expression, and it is thus likely involved in its regulation ( Figure 2 B). We next examined PDGFRA -adjacent cis -regulatory elements and observed specific activation in the form of discrete H3K27ac peaks throughout a 350-kb region on chromosome 4 (chr4), encompassing PDGFRA , GSX2 , and hs687 , that is unique to G34R/V HGGs ( Figure 4 A, bottom tracks; Figure S5 C).
To determine whether these H3K27ac peaks correspond to distal regulatory elements used to promote ectopic PDGFRA expression, we performed Hi-C chromosome conformation capture and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) ChIP-seq on G34R/V, K27M, and WT primary cell lines ( Figure 4 A; Figure S5 D; Table S4 ). We confirmed the presence of a topologically associated domain (TAD) encompassing the PDGFRA promoter ( Figure 4 A, dashed triangle), known to be present in non-cancerous somatic cells ( Flavahan et al., 2016 19. Flavahan, W.A. ∙ Drier, Y. ∙ Liau, B.B. ... Insulator dysfunction and oncogene activation in IDH mutant gliomas Nature. 2016; 529 :110-114 Crossref Scopus (594) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to this non-specific TAD, we uncovered a novel interaction loop in G34R/V cell lines ( Figure 4 A, solid triangle), linking the PDGFRA promoter with hs687 , the putative GSX2 enhancer element. In fact, throughout the region spanning PDGFRA , GSX2 , and hs687 , the TAD in G34R/V glioma cell lines harbored significantly more interactions in G34R/V compared with the H3 WT and K27M lines (p = 0.04, one-tailed t test), supporting a conformation with increased potential for ectopic activation of PDGFRA in G34R/V HGGs through active enhancer/promoter contacts.
PDGFRA expression in PDGFRA MUT G34R/V HGGs is higher than in PDGFRA WT tumors ( Figure S1 A), suggesting that additional cis -regulatory elements may augment expression of this RTK. We observed that PDGFRA MUT tumors further increased H3K27ac activation of regulatory elements within the neighboring region, including at the GSX2 promoter and hs687 , as well as new distal regulatory elements (e.g., chr4, ∼53,100,000) ( Figure S5 E). Consistent with the H3K27ac profile, Hi-C interaction matrices showed more PDGFRA -anchored distal interactions in the PDGFRA MUT cell line ( Figure S5 F, black boxes). This suggests that further activation of the existing chromatin conformation, particularly at key hs687 and GSX2 regulatory elements, is used to promote higher PDGFRA expression in samples carrying a mutation of this RTK.
The chromatin conformation of G34R/V tumors, bringing the PDGFRA promoter in close proximity to active GSX2 regulatory elements, may be transiently present during normal differentiation of the interneuron lineage. We thus investigated the dynamics of this region during murine development, comparing the epigenomic landscape and chromosome conformation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and E13.5 forebrain tissue ( Davis et al., 2018 14. Davis, C.A. ∙ Hitz, B.C. ∙ Sloan, C.A. ... The Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE): data portal update Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D794-D801 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lindtner et al., 2019 49. Lindtner, S. ∙ Catta-Preta, R. ∙ Tian, H. ... Genomic Resolution of DLX-Orchestrated Transcriptional Circuits Driving Development of Forebrain GABAergic Neurons Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :2048-2063.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). In ESCs, a strong promoter-promoter interaction is present between Pdgfra and Gsx2 , where both genic promoters are bivalently marked with active histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and repressive H3K27me3 marks ( Figure 4 B, bottom tracks). Chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) confirms that this loop between Pdgfra and Gsx2 promoters is anchored by PRC2-mediated contacts, indicating that this interaction is present while both genes are repressed ( Ngan et al., 2020 63. Ngan, C.Y. ∙ Wong, C.H. ∙ Tjong, H. ... Chromatin interaction analyses elucidate the roles of PRC2-bound silencers in mouse development Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :264-272 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, no interactions were observed in ESCs between Pdgfra and hs687 . At E13.5, in turn, a loop between hs687 and Gsx2 was detected in GEs (p = 0.03), confirming the function of this enhancer element as a driver of Gsx2 expression in the lineage ( Figure S5 G). More importantly, we observed that a second strong loop between Pdgfra and hs687 is formed uniquely in these GEs. In addition, we identify a TAD anchored at the Pdgfra promoter and hs687, analogous to the one found in G34R/V tumors, that is significantly enriched in GEs compared with the dorsal cortex (p = 0.04) and ESCs (p = 0.02). This increase in contact frequency is concurrent with increased H3K27ac at the hs687 enhancer and Gsx2 , confirming their active conformation in this developmental window. Pdgfra remains transcriptionally repressed in the GEs, retaining bivalent H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks, consistent with aberrant oncogenic expression of this RTK in G34R/V gliomas.
The epigenomic profiles of ESCs suggest that the promoters of Gsx2 and Pdgfra are physically anchored by the PRC2 complex and poised for activation ( Figure 4 C). In the neocortex, where progenitors give rise to excitatory neurons, the Gsx2-Pdgfra contact is weakened, and the Gsx2 promoter no longer possesses the potential to become activated, similar to what is observed in non-G34 HGGs. In contrast, in the GEs, where interneurons are born, Gsx2 contacts its distal enhancer hs687 for activation and remains bound to H3K27me3-repressed Pdgfra , bringing Pdgfra in close proximity to this active chromatin conformation. The transcriptomic and epigenomic evidence suggests that the chromatin architecture of G34R/V HGGs resembles that of a GSX2+ progenitor, with PDGFRA expression reflecting an oncogenic event. These results provide a mechanistic link for the interneuron progenitor-context dependency of PDGFRA mutations in G34R/V HGGs, where GSX2- associated cis -regulatory elements are recruited to induce aberrant PDGFRA expression in G34R/V tumors and, possibly, to a greater extent in PDGFRA mutants.
To evaluate the effect of PDGFRA mutations on cellular heterogeneity of G34R/V HGGs, we profiled 6 PDGFRA WT and 10 PDGFRA MUT tumors by scRNA-seq ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Figure S6 A; Table S5 ). Projection of malignant cells to a reference developmental brain atlas ( Jessa et al., 2019 30. Jessa, S. ∙ Blanchet-Cohen, A. ∙ Krug, B. ... Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1702-1713 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed that G34R/V tumors were predominantly comprised of neuron- and astrocyte-like cells, consistent with the reported heterogeneous histopathology. We observed a striking absence of oligodendroglial-like cells in all G34R/V tumors, in contrast to other pediatric and adult HGGs entities, where they were readily detectable ( Filbin et al., 2018 18. Filbin, M.G. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Hovestadt, V. ...

Decoupling genetics, lineages, and microenvironment in IDH-mutant gliomas by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2017; 355 :eaai8478 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ), and limited numbers of immune cells, similar to K27M gliomas ( Filbin et al., 2018 18. Filbin, M.G. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Hovestadt, V. ... Developmental and oncogenic programs in H3K27M gliomas dissected by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2018; 360 :331-335 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 C; Figure S6 B). At the level of individual cells, G34R/V astrocytic and neuronal cells were highly dysplastic, with most cells displaying abnormal co-expression of interneuron and astrocytic gene signatures and indefinite segregation between compartments ( Figure 5 D; Figure S6 C). Across individuals, G34R/V HGGs exhibited significant inter-tumor heterogeneity, with varying proportions of neuronal and astrocytic-like cells ( Figure 5 B; Figure S6 A). Importantly, G34R/V tumors mutant for PDGFRA displayed an expansion of the astrocytic compartment compared with WT tumors (p = 0.028, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), suggesting that acquisition of a PDGFRA mutation promotes an astrocytic state at the expense of the neuronal component.
We next examined the role of PDGFRA mutations in G34R/V tumor evolution from three available matched primary and recurrent tumor pairs ( Figure 6 A; Table S6 ). Phylogenetic trees inferred from allele frequencies revealed a remarkably high mutation burden (n = 4,218) consistent with a temozolomide treatment signature in P-1978 recurrence (G34R; PDGFRA WT ). In contrast, relatively few new mutations appeared in recurrences of individuals P-1190 and P-3200 (43 and 124 mutations, respectively), with PDGFRA the only gene commonly mutated in recurrences of both individuals. Moreover, there was little evidence of clonal heterogeneity ( Figure 6 A), suggesting strong sweeping selection for the new PDGFRA mutations acquired. At the transcriptomic level, scRNA-seq data from both individuals showed an expansion of the astrocytic compartment, with a concomitant decrease of the neuron-like compartment ( Figure 6 B). Moreover, the MAPK/ERK pathway was significantly more active in tumors mutant for PDGFRA ( Figure 1 C). Together, these findings suggest that the acquisition of PDGFRA mutations in G34R/V activates downstream MAPK signaling and leads to clonal selection, astrocytic expansion, and potentially oncogenic addiction upon recurrence.
To delineate individual effects of PDGFRA and G34R/V mutations on gliomagenesis, we compared latency with tumor formation in the murine IUE and CRISPR cell line models ( Pathania et al., 2017 67. Pathania, M. ∙ De Jay, N. ∙ Maestro, N. ... H3.3 K27M Cooperates with Trp53 Loss and PDGFRA Gain in Mouse Embryonic Neural Progenitor Cells to Induce Invasive High-Grade Gliomas Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :684-700.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with known oncogenic properties of PDGFRA D842V , immunohistochemical GFP staining showed extensive tumor growth in Pdgfra D842V -electroporated mice in as little as 1 month ( Figure 6 C). Addition of the G34R mutation did not affect latency in this model because H3f3a WT and H3f3a G34R IUE mice showed similar tumor growth and survival ( Figure 6 D). In contrast, GFP staining at 2 months upon electroporation of Pdgfra WT was largely negative. This finding is further reinforced in the time to tumor formation; 12 months post-IUE, H3f3a G34R ;Pdgfra WT formed tumors with two-thirds penetrance compared with EV;Pdgfra WT with similar latency and one-third penetrance. In contrast, Pdgfra D842V was strongly oncogenic and fully penetrant regardless of G34R presence, decreasing tumor latency for the entire cohort to 50 days.
Consistent with the IUE results, CRISPR editing of H3.3G34V and G34R mutations in the respective patient-derived cell lines KNS-42 and HSJD-GBM002 showed a limited effect on tumorigenicity in orthotopic xenograft models ( Figures 6 E–6H). Edited lines exhibited comparable latency to tumor formation as G34 mutant lines (median survival G34V/edited, 148/166 days; G34R/edited, 365/323 days) and developed tumors with similar histopathology ( Figures S7 A and S7B). These findings suggest that G34R/V mutations may become dispensable for oncogenic maintenance and, instead, probably co-opt PDGFRA mutations to promote gliomagenesis.

Section: Discussion

We comprehensively profiled the molecular landscape of H3.3G34R/V HGGs in the largest multi-institutional cohort to date, which features several rare cases of matched primary and recurrence tumors. We show an enrichment of activating PDGFRA mutations (44%), concurrent with elevated expression, in G34R/V primary tumors relative to all other HGG subtypes. This frequency is higher in the recurrence setting (81%) because tumors initially WT acquired PDGFRA mutations with strong selective pressure for the mutant clone at recurrence. PDGFRA is an important RTK in glial development and a recurrent driver in HGGs ( Mackay et al., 2017 55. Mackay, A. ∙ Burford, A. ∙ Carvalho, D. ...

Indeed, PDGFRA amplifications are commonly observed in K27M mutant midline gliomas (40%) ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012 32. Khuong-Quang, D.A. ∙ Buczkowicz, P. ∙ Rakopoulos, P. ...

Mackay, A. ∙ Burford, A. ∙ Carvalho, D. ...

Conversely, IDH1 mutant HGGs use a distal enhancer through DNA methylation of a proximal CTCF insulator to overexpress PDGFRA ( Flavahan et al., 2016 19. Flavahan, W.A. ∙ Drier, Y. ∙ Liau, B.B. ... Insulator dysfunction and oncogene activation in IDH mutant gliomas Nature. 2016; 529 :110-114 Crossref Scopus (594) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas activating mutations are more frequently observed in non-brainstem gliomas occurring in older children (14%) ( Koschmann et al., 2016 37. Koschmann, C. ∙ Zamler, D. ∙ MacKay, A. ... Characterizing and targeting PDGFRA alterations in pediatric high-grade glioma Oncotarget. 2016; 7 :65696-65706 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paugh et al., 2013 68.

The high frequency of PDGFRA mutations unique to G34R/V gliomas is likely due to their distinct differentiation program. Our data suggest that G34R/V tumors originate in GSX2+ interneuron progenitors ( Figure 7 ), where the oncohistone impedes terminal neuronal differentiation through altered H3K36me3 deposition and aberrant H3K27me3 retention at specific genes, a pattern suggested by prior biochemical analyses performed on G34R/V mutant nucleosomes ( Lewis et al., 2013 44. Lewis, P.W. ∙ Müller, M.M. ∙ Koletsky, M.S. ... Inhibition of PRC2 activity by a gain-of-function H3 mutation found in pediatric glioblastoma Science. 2013; 340 :857-861 Crossref Scopus (713) PubMed Google Scholar ). This progenitor state likely maintains the lineage-specific GSX2 enhancer in an active chromatin conformation state, rendering the locus permissive to transcriptional exploitation and aberrant PDGFRA expression ( Figure 7 ). The spatial contact between GSX2 and PDGFRA seems to be an early event, present in ESCs, where expression of both genes is repressed by PRC2/H3K27me3. As cells undergo neuronal differentiation, it is uniquely preserved in Gsx2+ interneuron progenitors in E13.5 GEs, whereas it is lost in other neuronal populations, as our data indicate. In GEs, Pdgfra remains in a poised state in close physical proximity with Gsx2 -associated enhancer machinery (including hs687 ), presenting an opportunity for oncogenic co-option, because the epigenetic landscape favors activation of this lineage factor. We speculate that PDGFRA -mutant tumors may form additional contacts with distal regulatory elements to maintain high PDGFRA expression, fueling their oncogenic addiction and dependence on PDGFRA, given the selective advantage of this mutant RTK. Whether the G34R/V mutation occurs during this embryonic window of development or in postnatal GSX2 + interneuron progenitors in the SVZ remains to be determined.
Ectopic PDGFRA expression and subsequent acquisition of activating mutations likely promote astroglial features in G34R/V-stalled interneuron progenitors. Notably, a Nestin - inducible K27M/ T r p53 cKO mouse model aiming to model K27M midline gliomas led to neuronal high-grade tumors that became HGGs only upon co-expression of PDGFRA V544ins ( Larson et al., 2019 43. Larson, J.D. ∙ Kasper, L.H. ∙ Paugh, B.S. ... Histone H3.3 K27M Accelerates Spontaneous Brainstem Glioma and Drives Restricted Changes in Bivalent Gene Expression Cancer Cell. 2019; 35 :140-155.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), in keeping with a major role of PDGFRA mutations in driving gliogenesis. Specific induction of downstream MAPK signaling is probably necessary for expansion of astrocytic lineage programs in G34R/V tumors because increasing ERK activation has been shown to promote glial specification at the expense of neuronal lineages ( Li et al., 2014 47. Li, S. ∙ Mattar, P. ∙ Dixit, R. ... RAS/ERK signaling controls proneural genetic programs in cortical development and gliomagenesis J. Neurosci. 2014; 34 :2169-2190 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, persistent high levels of GSX2 and DLX1/2 are likely responsible for the absence of oligodendroglial lineage programs in G34R/V HGGs because downregulation of these TFs is required for transition from neurogenesis to oligodendrocyte formation in the ventral forebrain ( Chapman et al., 2013 8. Chapman, H. ∙ Waclaw, R.R. ∙ Pei, Z. ...

Dlx1 and Dlx2 control neuronal versus oligodendroglial cell fate acquisition in the developing forebrain Neuron. 2007; 55 :417-433 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our data suggest that PDGFRA mutants are robust glioma drivers in G34R/V HGGs and that, in contrast to K27M ( Harutyunyan et al., 2019 26. Harutyunyan, A.S. ∙ Krug, B. ∙ Chen, H. ... H3K27M induces defective chromatin spread of PRC2-mediated repressive H3K27me2/me3 and is essential for glioma tumorigenesis Nat.

We show that ∼80% of PDGFRA mutations occurred in the extracellular domain, with the glioma-specific C235Y/F mutations alone accounting for 30% of all PDGFRA mutations in G34R/V. These neomorphic mutations constitutively activate this RTK, as also suggested by downstream activation of the MAPK pathway observed in PDGFRA MUT G34R/V HGGs. These mutants may have additional biochemical properties that warrant specific investigation, as alluded to by one study indicating that they may be resistant to standard PDGFRA inhibitors ( Ip et al., 2018 29. Ip, C.K.M. ∙ Ng, P.K.S. ∙ Jeong, K.J. ... Neomorphic PDGFRA extracellular domain driver mutations are resistant to PDGFRA targeted therapies Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4583 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initially targeting the downstream MAPK pathway may be of benefit in this context, but further investigations are needed to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumors with extracellular-domain PDGFRA mutations.
In sum, we highlight a novel mechanism where PDGFRA expression is ectopically promoted by the interneuron TF GSX2 , potentially leading to the high rate of activating mutations of this RTK specifically in G34R/V HGGs. Cells that acquire a PDGFRA mutation undergo sweeping clonal selection and potently activate MAPK signaling to promote gliomagenesis. These mechanisms have important therapeutic implications because G34R/V HGGs are classified as gliomas based on morphology, whereas they seem neuronal in origin based on genetic and molecular markers. These tumors are invariably lethal, and PDGFRA mutations and downstream MAPK activation are potentially actionable targets, providing hope for novel therapeutic opportunities in this deadly cancer.

Protocols for this study involving collection of patient samples and information were approved by the Research Ethics and Review Board of McGill University and affiliated Hospitals Research Institutes. Informed consent was obtained from all research participants. Clinical information (age, sex) and mutation status of primary HGG tumor samples are presented in Table S1 .
We thank Drs. Angel M. Carcaboso and Dinesh Rakheja for generously sharing primary HGG-derived cell lines. The HSJD-GBM002 cell line was cultured in NeuroCult NS-A proliferation media (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with bFGF (10 ng/mL), rhEGF (20 ng/mL), and heparin (0.0002%) (StemCell Technologies) and on plates coated with poly-L-ornithine (0.01%) (Sigma) and laminin (0.01 mg/mL) (Sigma). KNS-42, PS10-801 and CMC1118G8 cell lines were cultured in DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose, L-glutamine, phenol red, and 10% FBS (Wisent). All lines were tested monthly for mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection kit by Lonza), and STR fingerprinting was regularly performed. Clinical information (age, sex) and mutation status of primary HGG cell lines are presented in Table S7 .
All mice were housed, bred, and subjected to listed procedures according to the McGill University Health Center Animal Care Committee and in compliance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines, and Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) and UK Home Office guidelines (Project license 70/8240, 70/7428 and 80/2325). Live colonies were maintained and genotyped as per Jackson Laboratories guidelines and protocols. Mice were housed together and monitored daily for neurological symptoms of brain tumors (weight loss, epilepsy, altered gait, lethargy) and euthanized immediately at clinical endpoint when recommended by veterinary and biological services staff members.
Female NOD SCID (RRID:IMSR_JAX:005557) mice (4-6 weeks, 18-25 g) were used for xenograft experiments. Tissue from ganglionic eminences and cortex was isolated from embryos at gestation day E13 (plug day considered as day 0) using B6C3F1/J (RRID:IMSR_CRL:031) or FoxG1-cre (B6.129T(SJL)-Foxg1tm1.1(cre)Ddmo/J) (RRID:IMSR_JAX:029690) pregnant mice (6-8 weeks, 20-25 g). In utero electroporations were performed on pregnant C57BL/6J (RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664) female mice at E13.5.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed at Histology Platform (RI-MUHC) and the Segal Cancer Centre Research Pathology Facility (Jewish General Hospital). G34R/V high-grade glioma samples were cut at 4-6 μm, placed on SuperFrost/Plus slides (Fisher) and dried overnight at 37°C, before IHC processing. After de-paraffinization and epitope retrieval, sections were incubated with primary antibodies: phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204, 4376 Cell Signaling, RRID: AB_331772 ) in 1:100; and PDGFRA (AF-307-NA, R&D Systems, 1:100, RRID: AB_354459 ). Slides were then loaded onto the Discovery XT Autostainer or Ventana Discovery Ultra Instrument (Ventana Medical Systems). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, blued with Bluing Reagent, washed, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared in xylene, and mounted with mounting medium (Eukitt, Fluka Analytical) or Leica CV 5030 coverslipper. Sections were analyzed by conventional light microscopy or scanned using the Aperio AT Turbo Scanner (Leica Biosystems).
CRISPR-Cas9 editing of KNS-42 cell line was performed as described in Ran et al. (2013) 76. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (5071) PubMed Google Scholar . The pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459 V2.0) was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #62988). A sgRNA targeting the H3F3A G34V mutation was cloned into the plasmid, and the construct was transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected cells were selected with puromycin for 3 days. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of HSJD-GBM002 cell line was performed by designing a synthetic ALT-R crRNA (IDT) guide targeting the H3F3A G34R mutation. Nucleofection was performed using program A-023 on the Amaxa Nucleofector 2b (Lonza) device, following manufacturer’s instructions to introduce crRNA, tracrRNA and recombinant Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (IDT). Single cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution, expanded and screened for editing events at the target locus by Sanger sequencing and confirmed through targeted deep sequencing using Illumina MiSeq.

HSJD-GBM002 and KNS-42 CRISPR clones were cultured in 8-well chambers. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 15% sucrose in PBS solution for 20 minutes at 4°C. Permeabilization was performed with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 mins on ice, followed by incubation in blocking buffer of 5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies specific for Histone H3.3 G34R or G34V (RevMab 31-1120 RRID: AB_2716433 and 31-1193 RRID: AB_2716435 ), diluted 1:200 in 1% BSA/PBS solution. Incubation with secondary anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 antibodies (ThermoFisher Scientific) was performed at 1:1000 dilution in PBS under light protection for 90 minutes. ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with blue DNA DAPI stain (ThermoFisher Scientific) was applied. Fluorescent signal was captured the following day.
The complete workflow for histone extraction, LC/MS, and data analysis was described in detail ( Karch et al., 2016 31. Karch, K.R. ∙ Sidoli, S. ∙ Garcia, B.A. Identification and quantification of histone PTMs using high-resolution mass spectrometry Methods Enzymol. 2016; 574 :3-29 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sidoli et al., 2016 86. Sidoli, S. ∙ Bhanu, N.V. ∙ Karch, K.R. ... Complete workflow for analysis of histone post-translational modifications using bottom-up mass spectrometry: from histone extraction to data analysis J. Vis. Exp. 2016; 54112 Google Scholar ). Briefly, cell pellets (∼1 × 10 6 cells) were lysed on ice in nuclear isolation buffer supplemented with 0.3% NP-40 alternative. Isolated nuclei were incubated with 0.4 N H2SO4 for 3 h at 4°C with agitation. 100% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) was added to the acid extract to a final concentration of 20% and samples were incubated on ice overnight to precipitate histones. The resulting histone pellets were rinsed with ice cold acetone + 0.1% HCl and then with ice cold acetone before resuspension in water and protein estimation by Bradford assay. Approximately 20 μg of histone extract was then resuspended in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and derivatized with propionic anhydride. 1 μg of trypsin was added and samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. After tryptic digestion, a cocktail of isotopically-labeled synthetic histone peptides was spiked in at a final concentration of 250 fmol/μg and propionic anhydride derivatization was performed for second time. The resulting histone peptides were desalted using C18 Stage Tips, dried using a centrifugal evaporator, and reconstituted using 0.1% formic acid in preparation for nanoLC-MS analysis.
nanoLC was performed using a Thermo ScientificTM Easy nLCTM 1000 equipped with a 75 μm × 20 cm in-house packed column using Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ (3 μm; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany). Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid and Buffer B was 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Peptides were resolved using a two-step linear gradient from 5 to 33% B over 45 min, then from 33 to 90% B over 10 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The HPLC was coupled online to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer operating in the positive mode using a Nanospray FlexTM Ion Source (Thermo Scientific) at 2.3 kV. Two full MS scans (m/z 300–1100) were acquired in the orbitrap mass analyzer with a resolution of 120,000 (at 200 m/z) every 8 DIA MS/MS events using isolation windows of 50 m/z each (e.g., 300–350, 350–400, ...,650–700). MS/MS spectra were acquired in the ion trap operating in normal mode. Fragmentation was performed using collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the ion trap mass analyzer with a normalized collision energy of 35. AGC target and maximum injection time were 10e6 and 50 ms for the full MS scan, and 10e4 and 150 ms for the MS/MS can, respectively. Raw files were analyzed using EpiProfile.
Female NOD SCID mice (4-6 weeks) were used for xenograft experiments. Mice were injected with the following cell lines at a density of 7x10 5 cells in the parietal cortex, using the following coordinates from bregma: anteroposterior −1.94 mm, mediolateral 2.5 mm, dorsoventral 1.4 mm. For KNS-42: (1) Parental cells ( H3F3A +/G34V , n = 3), Clone 1-9 ( H3F3A +/− , n = 3), Clone 2-2 ( H3F3A +/− , n = 3). For HSJD-GBM002: (1) Parental cells ( H3F3A +/G34R , n = 2), Clone F06 ( H3F3A +/G34R , n = 4), Clone A10 ( H3F3A +/G34R , n = 4), Clone C08 ( H3F3A +/− , n = 4), Clone A09 ( H3F3A +/+ , n = 4). Stereotaxic injections were performed using the Robot Stereotaxic machine from Neurostar. At clinical endpoint, brains were removed and fixed in formalin for histological analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated using Graphpad Prism software.
Tissue from ganglionic eminences (GEs) and cortex was isolated from embryos at gestation day 13 (plug day considered as day 0) using B6C3F1/J or FoxG1-cre (B6.129T(SJL)-Foxg1tm1.1(cre)Ddmo/J) pregnant mice. Mice were anesthetized, and euthanized by CO 2 exposure followed by cervical dislocation. Uterine horns containing the embryos were removed and placed in cold 1X HBSS buffer (containing 1% Penicillin/streptomycin). Embryos were removed and dissected under the microscope. The brain was removed from the skull, forebrain was separated, and placed in a new Petri dish containing cold 1X HBSS buffer. Cortices of each hemisphere were cut using micro-scissors to expose the GEs. GEs were then isolated and placed in 12-well plates until cell dissociation. Matching cortices were recovered and similarly processed. Cells were dissociated by pipetting the tissue into a single-cell suspension that was processed as per requirements for downstream experiments. In addition, whole brains at E13 and P0 were fixed in formalin for histological analyses.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed at Histology Platform (RI-MUHC) and the Segal Cancer Centre Research Pathology Facility (Jewish General Hospital). PDOX and mouse brain tissue samples were cut at 4-6 μm, placed on SuperFrost/Plus slides (Fisher) and dried overnight at 37°C, before IHC processing. After de-paraffinization and epitope retrieval, sections were incubated with primary antibodies: Gsx2 (ABN162, Millipore Sigma RRID: AB_11203296 ) in 1:100; H3.3 G34R (RM240, RevMAb Biosciences, RRID: AB_2716433 ) in 1:50; and H3.3 G34V (RM307, RevMAb Biosciences RRID: AB_2716435 ) in 1:40. Slides were then loaded onto the Discovery XT Autostainer or Ventana Discovery Ultra Instrument (Ventana Medical Systems). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, blued with Bluing Reagent, washed, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared in xylene, and mounted with mounting medium (Eukitt, Fluka Analytical) or Leica CV 5030 coverslipper. Sections were analyzed by conventional light microscopy or scanned using the Aperio AT Turbo Scanner (Leica Biosystems).
The piggyBac donor and helper vector system (CAG-PBase, PBCAG-GFP) was used to transduce NPCs in utero as described previously ( Chen and LoTurco, 2012 10. Chen, F. ∙ LoTurco, J. A method for stable transgenesis of radial glia lineage in rat neocortex by piggyBac mediated transposition J. Neurosci. Methods. 2012; 207 :172-180 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two ATRX shRNA vectors, cDNA encoding murine Pdgfra and cDNA encoding C-terminal HA-tagged Drosophila His3.3A (highly conserved ortholog of mammalian H3f3a ) were cloned into the PBCAG-GFP vector to generate shAtrx-Pdgfra WT -H3f3a WT constructs, previously described in Pathania et al. (2017) 67. Pathania, M. ∙ De Jay, N. ∙ Maestro, N. ...

In utero electroporations were performed using sterile technique on isoflurane/oxygen-anesthetized pregnant C57BL/6J female mice at E13.5 (cortex) as described ( Nitarska et al., 2016 64. Nitarska, J. ∙ Smith, J.G. ∙ Sherlock, W.T. ... A Functional Switch of NuRD Chromatin Remodeling Complex Subunits Regulates Mouse Cortical Development Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :1683-1698 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analgesic support was provided pre-emptively (subcutaneous delivery of Vetergesic and Carpofen at 0.1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively). Uterine horns were exposed through a 1 cm incision and individual embryos were digitally manipulated into the correct orientation for intraventricular injection. Pulled borosilicate capillaries were loaded with endotoxin-free DNA and Fast Green dye (0.05%, Sigma) for visualization, and a microinjector (Eppendorf) was used to inject either the lateral or fourth ventricles with the DNA-dye mixture. 3-5 plasmids were injected simultaneously, each at a final concentration of 2 μg/μl and 1-2 μL of total solution was injected per embryo. DNA was electroporated into cortical neural progenitors using 5 mm tweezertrodes (BTX), or into lower rhombic lip progenitors using 3 mm tweezertrodes, applying 5 square pulses at 35 V, 50 ms each with 950 ms intervals. The embryos were returned into the abdominal cavity, the muscle and skin were sutured and the animal was monitored until fully recovered from the procedure.
Animals were euthanized by CO 2 exposure and/or cervical dislocation and cortices were rapidly dissected in ice-cold dissociation medium containing: 20 mM glucose, 81.8 mM Na 2 SO 4 , 30 mM K 2 SO 4 , 5.8 mM MgCl 2 , 250 μM CaCl 2 , 1 mM HEPES, 160 μM NaOH, 0.8 mM kynurenic acid, 50 μM D-APV, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 5 μg/ml plasmocin and 100 μg/ml primocin. GFP + regions were microdissected under an epifluorescence stereomicroscope in the same medium and enzymatically digested into a single-cell suspension using the Papain Dissociation System (Worthington Biochemicals) followed by mechanical trituration through a series of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. The dissociated cell solution was then separated on an OptiPrep density gradient to remove debris and GFP + TdTomato + cells were sorted using a FACSAria III or LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences) into Hibernate-E media (Life Technologies) containing 2% B-27, 2 mM Glutamax, 0.8 mM kynurenic acid, 50 μM D-APV, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 5 μg/ml plasmocin and 100 μg/ml primocin. Sorted cells were plated into NeuroCult NSC proliferation media (STEMCELL Technologies) containing 10 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF, Peprotech) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Peprotech) on laminin-coated culture vessels (Sigma).

The PDGFRA mutants Y288C and C235Y, in the Ig-like domain 3, were modeled using the structure of PDGFRB (PDB ID: 3MJG ), with a 29% sequence identity to PDGFRA in this region, where the residues of interest are conserved ( Shim et al., 2010 84. Shim, A.H.-R. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Focia, P.J. ... Structures of a platelet-derived growth factor/propeptide complex and a platelet-derived growth factor/receptor complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :11307-11312 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). The PDGFRA mutant K385M, in the Ig-like domain 4, was modeled using the structure of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VGFR1) (PDB ID: 5T89 ), with a 29% sequence identity to PDGFRA in this region ( Markovic-Mueller et al., 2017 57. Markovic-Mueller, S. ∙ Stuttfeld, E. ∙ Asthana, M. ... Structure of the Full-length VEGFR-1 Extracellular Domain in Complex with VEGF-A Structure. 2017; 25 :341-352 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). The corresponding three residues were mutated and subsequently modeled in PyMOL.
DNA was extracted from tumors using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturer instructions. The Nextera Rapid Capture Exome kit (Illumina) or SureSelect Reagent Exome kit (Agilent) were used to prepare libraries according to manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end sequencing (100 bp) was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2500/4000 platform.
Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad) and tumors using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (QIAGEN) according to instructions from the manufacturers. Library preparation was performed with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion according to instructions from the manufacturer (Epicenter) to achieve greater coverage of mRNA and other long non-coding transcripts. Paired-end sequencing (100 bp) was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2500/4000 or NovaSeq 6000 platforms.
Raw reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.32 ( Bolger et al., 2014 3. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (19203) PubMed Google Scholar ). Adaptors and other Illumina-specific sequences were removed using palindrome mode. Next, a four-nucleotide sliding window was used to remove the bases once the average quality within the window fell below 30. Finally, reads shorter than 30 base pairs were dropped. For WES, cleaned reads were aligned to the human reference genome build hg19 using BWA-MEM ( Li and Durbin, 2009 45. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (21358) PubMed Google Scholar ) v0.7.17 with default settings. Read duplicates were removed using Picard tools v2.10.7. For RNA-seq, cleaned reads were aligned to the human reference genome build hg19 using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 16. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (12754) PubMed Google Scholar ) v2.3.0e with default settings. Multiple control metrics ( Table S2 A) were obtained using FASTQC (v0.11.2), samtools ( Li et al., 2009 46. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The sequence alignment/map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (24672) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v0.1.20), BEDtools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 73. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (8986) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v2.17.0) and custom scripts. For visualization, normalized Bigwig tracks were generated using BEDtools and UCSC tools. Integrative Genomic Viewer ( Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013 92. Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Robinson, J.T. ∙ Mesirov, J.P. Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV): high-performance genomics data visualization and exploration Brief. Bioinform. 2013; 14 :178-192 Crossref Scopus (4022) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for data visualization.
GATK ( DePristo et al., 2011 15. DePristo, M.A. ∙ Banks, E. ∙ Poplin, R. ... A framework for variation discovery and genotyping using next-generation DNA sequencing data Nat. Genet. 2011; 43 :491-498 Crossref Scopus (6094) PubMed Google Scholar ) v3.2-2 split’N’Trim was used to split reads in splice junction and rescale the mapping quality from 255 to 60. Then, GATK v3.2-2 IndelRealigner was used to realign the indels. Single-nucleotide variants were called using samtools ( Li et al., 2009 46. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The sequence alignment/map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (24672) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v0.1.20) mpileup and Annovar ( Wang et al., 2010 100. Wang, K. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Hakonarson, H. ANNOVAR: functional annotation of genetic variants from high-throughput sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :e164 Crossref Scopus (6208) PubMed Google Scholar ) v2016Feb01 was used for annotation ( Table S1 ). More specifically, variants were annotated using hg19 build with RefSeq gene, dbSNP (snp138), 1000 Genomes Project (1000 g2015aug_all), SIFT, PolyPhen, LRT, MutationTaster, GERP++ and PhastCons. Variants with a total read count of less than 10, an alternative allele read count of less than three, a SNV ratio of less than 0.2, an indel read ratio of less than 0.15, a variant quality of less than 20, a mapping quality less than 15, a strand bias p value lower than 0.001 and a minor allele frequency higher than 0.001 were filtered out. Variants in repetitive regions (RepeatMasker, InterruptedRpts, segmentalDups, simpleRepeats and retroposons) or annotated as benign or likely benign from ClinVar ( Landrum et al., 2018 40. Landrum, M.J. ∙ Lee, J.M. ∙ Benson, M. ... ClinVar: improving access to variant interpretations and supporting evidence Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D1062-D1067 Crossref Scopus (845) PubMed Google Scholar ) were also filtered out. In addition, only variants of the following types were kept for downstream analyses: nonsynonymous SNV, splicing, splicing-extended, stop-gain and stop-loss. For gene amplification inference from WES, copy number variants (CNVs) were inferred from calculating RPKM coverage over annotated ENSEMBL genes. Samples were denoted as being positive for genic amplification if RPKM coverage was > 2-fold of the median RPKM.
For reconstruction of tumor phylogeny ( Table S6 ), somatic variant calling was performed as previously described in Suzuki et al. (2019) 91. Suzuki, H. ∙ Kumar, S.A. ∙ Shuai, S. ... Recurrent noncoding U1 snRNA mutations drive cryptic splicing in SHH medulloblastoma Nature. 2019; 574 :707-711 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar . Sequencing reads were aligned to human reference genome ‘hs37d5′ by 1000 Genomes Project Phase II, using Burrows Wheeler aligner (BWA) – MEM ( Li and Durbin, 2009 45. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (21358) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v0.7.9) with ‘-T 0’ option. Duplicates were marked using biobambam v.0.0.148. Samples without matched controls were run with a pseudo-control generated from 25 randomly selected WES samples from 1000 Genomes Project. Fastq files were mapped with the same settings and subsampled using the samtools view function to adjust sequencing coverage around 200x.
Variants were called using eight variant callers: MuTect2 ( Cibulskis et al., 2013 12. Cibulskis, K. ∙ Lawrence, M.S. ∙ Carter, S.L. ... Sensitive detection of somatic point mutations in impure and heterogeneous cancer samples Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31 :213-219 Crossref Scopus (2383) PubMed Google Scholar ), EBCall ( Shiraishi et al., 2013 85. Shiraishi, Y. ∙ Sato, Y. ∙ Chiba, K. ...

Rimmer, A. ∙ Phan, H. ∙ Mathieson, I. ..., WGS500 Consortium Integrating mapping-, assembly- and haplotype-based approaches for calling variants in clinical sequencing applications Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :912-918 Crossref Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Seurat ( Christoforides et al., 2013 11. Christoforides, A. ∙ Carpten, J.D. ∙ Weiss, G.J. ... Identification of somatic mutations in cancer through Bayesian-based analysis of sequenced genome pairs BMC Genomics. 2013; 14 :302 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each caller except for Strelka was run as previously described in Suzuki et al. (2019) 91. Suzuki, H. ∙ Kumar, S.A. ∙ Shuai, S. ... Recurrent noncoding U1 snRNA mutations drive cryptic splicing in SHH medulloblastoma Nature. 2019; 574 :707-711 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar . Because the previously described method was for whole genome sequencing, Strelka was run with ‘isSkipDepthFilters = 1’. Variants were identified if called by at least two callers, with ≥ 2 variant reads, ≥ 7 total reads and ≥ 0.05 variant allele frequency in the tumor and ≤ 1 variant read in the control, as calculated using the realignment function of Genomon-MutationFilter v.0.2.1.
For samples without matched controls, variants with a frequency ≥ 0.01 in 1000 Genomes, dbSNP138, Exome Aggregation Consortium database, NHLBI-ESP project, Kaviar Genomic Variant Database, Haplotype Reference Consortium database, Greater Middle East Variome, or Brazilian genomic variants database were discarded. Missense, synonymous mutations or non-frameshift indels registered in any SNP databases listed above a frequency of 0.01 and registered with fewer than 10 samples in COSMIC v87 were also discarded. Variants with SIFT score ≥ 0.05, PolyPhen-2 HDIV ≤ 0.908, PolyPhen-2 HVAR ≤ 0.956, “polymorphism” or “polymorphism_automatic” by MutationTaster, and variants “predicted non-functional” by MutationAssessor were discarded. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on shared mutations detected in exons, splice sites, or UTRs. Fish-plots were generated using R package fish-plot (v0.5).
Gene expression levels were estimated by quantifying reads uniquely mapped to exonic regions defined by ensGene annotation set from Ensembl (GRCh37, n = 60,234 genes) using featureCounts ( Liao et al., 2014 48. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (5475) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v1.4.4). Normalization (mean-of-ratios), variance-stabilized transformation of the data and differential gene expression analysis were performed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 52. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (20187) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v1.14.1). Unless otherwise stated, all reported p-value s have been adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. For tumors, comparisons were performed between G34R/V samples and each other tumor entity, with batch included as a covariate.
To evaluate developmental gene programs in tumor samples, a reference panel of 167 forebrain cell-type specific signatures was assembled using data from five published scRNaseq atlases ( Anderson et al., 2020 1. Anderson, A.G. ∙ Kulkarni, A. ∙ Harper, M. ...

Single-cell genomics identifies cell type-specific molecular changes in autism Science. 2019; 364 :685-689 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), spanning embryonal mouse forebrain, P9 striatum, adult mouse sub-ventricular zone, fetal huma n telencephalon, and pediatric and adult human cortex. For the mouse forebrain dataset, 100-gene signatures were used as reported in the original study. For the mouse striatum and the two human datasets, we derived 100-gene signatures from the published cluster markers by filtering out genes encoding ribosomal proteins (defined as having a gene symbol matching “Rps,” “Rpl,” “Mrps,” “Mrpl”), and selecting the top 100 genes ranked by adjusted p value. Finally, for the mouse SVZ dataset, we called markers by performing differential gene expression analysis for the clusters reported by the authors in the original study, and subsequently derived the 100-gene signatures. Proliferating clusters were identified as those either annotated by the authors of the original studies, or with high expression of the proliferation marker Top2a (mean cluster expression > 0.4). Signatures from these clusters were excluded from analysis to prevent spurious enrichment due to cell cycle genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed with these signatures as input, applied to expressed genes in tumor transcriptomes (bulk RNA-seq) ranked using the Negative Binomial Wald test statistic from differential expression analysis, using the fgsea package ( Sergushichev, 2016 83. Sergushichev, A.A. An algorithm for fast preranked gene set enrichment analysis using cumulative statistic calculation bioRxiv. 2016; Crossref Google Scholar ) (v1.8.0). With fgsea, leading edge genes were obtained and normalized enrichment scores (NES) were computed by normalizing enrichment to the average enrichment of 10,000 random gene samples. P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure; signatures with adjusted p value < 0.01 were considered significantly enriched or depleted.
In the case of cell line datasets, the sample size was not adequate to perform GSEA, and thus enrichment of human radial glia and interneuron gene signatures was evaluated using single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) ( Barbie et al., 2009 2. Barbie, D.A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Boehm, J.S. ... Systematic RNA interference reveals that oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers require TBK1 Nature. 2009; 462 :108-112 Crossref Scopus (1313) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the GSVA ( Hänzelmann et al., 2013 25. Hänzelmann, S. ∙ Castelo, R. ∙ Guinney, J. GSVA: gene set variation analysis for microarray and RNA-seq data BMC Bioinformatics. 2013; 14 :7 Crossref Scopus (1652) PubMed Google Scholar ) package (v1.27.0) as described previously ( Jessa et al., 2019 30. Jessa, S. ∙ Blanchet-Cohen, A. ∙ Krug, B. ... Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1702-1713 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Gene expression patterns of individual genes during human and mouse brain development were assessed across three previously reported scRNaseq reference developmental datasets ( Anderson et al., 2020 1. Anderson, A.G. ∙ Kulkarni, A. ∙ Harper, M. ... Single-Cell Analysis of Foxp1-Driven Mechanisms Essential for Striatal Development Cell Rep. 2020; 30 :3051-3066.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jessa et al., 2019 30.

Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex Science. 2017; 358 :1318-1323 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dendrograms of gene expression in neural cell types displayed in Figure 3 and Figure S5 were constructed as follows: normalized gene expression, cell type annotations (cluster assignments) and cluster gene signatures (cluster markers) were obtained from original publications ( Jessa et al., 2019 30. Jessa, S. ∙ Blanchet-Cohen, A. ∙ Krug, B. ... Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1702-1713 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nowakowski et al., 2017 65. Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Pollen, A.A. ... Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex Science. 2017; 358 :1318-1323 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each cluster and each gene, the mean expression across cells from the cluster was computed, as well as the proportion of cells in which the gene was detected (UMI counts > 0). Genes appearing in any of the clusters’ signatures were selected for unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Spearman’s rank correlation was used as distance metric on the cluster mean gene expression profiles, and complete linkage as agglomeration method. For visualization purposes, mean gene expression was scaled across clusters to [0,1].
To profile gene expression during normal interneuron differentiation, displayed in Figure 2 F, we used a previously reported reconstruction of the interneuron differentiation trajectory ( Jessa et al., 2019 30. Jessa, S. ∙ Blanchet-Cohen, A. ∙ Krug, B. ... Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1702-1713 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which ventral radial glial cells, interneuron progenitors, and interneurons from the E12.5, E15.5, and P0 mouse forebrain were ordered in pseudotime using Monocle ( Qiu et al., 2017a 71. Qiu, X. ∙ Hill, A. ∙ Packer, J. ... Single-cell mRNA quantification and differential analysis with Census Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :309-315 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017b 72. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (701) PubMed Google Scholar ). For visualization, Monocle (v2.0.1) was used to fit, for each gene, a smooth spline to the nonlinear expression dynamics as a function of pseudotime. Smoothed expression was then z-scored across pseudotime and extreme upper and lower values were set to 3 and −3 respectively. The genes displayed in the heatmap are the union of genes identified as specific to G34R/V gliomas by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Genes enriched in G34R/V were defined as those 1) in the leading edge of the human interneuron gene signature most significantly enriched in G34R/V (ranked by NES, GSEA analysis), or 2) significantly upregulated in G34R/V (adj. p value < 0.01 and log2 fold-change > 2, RNA-seq differential expression analysis) and enriched for promoter H3K27ac in G34R/V (z-score > 0.6, ChIP-seq analysis). Conversely, genes were defined as depleted in G34R/V were genes 1) in the leading edge of the human interneuron gene signature most significantly depleted in G34R/V (ranked by NES, GSEA analysis), or 2) significantly downregulated in G34R/V (adj. p value < 0.01 and log2 fold-change < −2, RNA-seq differential expression analysis) and enriched for promoter H3K27me3 in G34R/V (z-score > 0.6).
ChIP-seq was performed as previously described in Harutyunyan et al. (2019) 26. Harutyunyan, A.S. ∙ Krug, B. ∙ Chen, H. ... H3K27M induces defective chromatin spread of PRC2-mediated repressive H3K27me2/me3 and is essential for glioma tumorigenesis Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1262 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, cells (cell lines or dissociated tumor cells) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma). Fixed cell preparations were washed, pelleted and stored at −80°C. Sonication of lysed nuclei (lysed in a buffer containing 1% SDS) was performed on a BioRuptor UCD-300 for 60 cycles, 10 s on 20 s off. Samples were checked for sonication efficiency using the criteria of 150–500 bp by gel electrophoresis. After sonication, the chromatin was diluted to reduce SDS level to 0.1% and before ChIP reaction 2% of sonicated Drosophila S2 cell chromatin was spiked-in the samples.
ChIP reaction for histone modifications was performed on a Diagenode SX-8G IP-Star Compact using Diagenode automated Ideal ChIP-seq Kit. Twenty-five microliter Protein A beads (Invitrogen) were washed and then incubated with antibodies (anti-H3K27me3 (1:40, CST 9733 RRID: AB_2616029 ), (anti-H3K27ac (1:80, Diagenode C15410196 RRID: AB_2637079 )), (anti-H3K36me3 (1:100, Active Motif 61021 RRID: AB_2614986 )), (anti-H3.3 (1:66, Millipore 09–838)), and 2 million cells of sonicated cell lysate combined with protease inhibitors for 10 h, followed by 20 min wash cycle with provided wash buffers. ChIP reactions for SUZ12 and CTCF were performed RRID: AB_10845793 as follows: anti-SUZ12 (1:150, CST 3737 RRID: AB_2196850 ) or anti-CTCF (1 μg/reaction, Diagenode C15410210 RRID: AB_2753160 ) antibodies were conjugated by incubating with 40 μl protein A beads at 4°C for 6 h, then chromatin from ∼4 million cells was added in RIPA buffer, incubated at 4°C o/n, washed using buffers from Ideal ChIP-seq Kit (one wash with each buffer, corresponding to RIPA, RIPA + 500 mM NaCl, LiCl, TE), eluted from beads by incubating with Elution buffer for 30 min at room temperature.
Reverse cross linking took place on a heat block at 65°C for 4 h. ChIP samples were then treated with 2 μl RNase Cocktail at 65°C for 30 min followed by 2 μl Proteinase K at 65°C for 30 min. Samples were then purified with QIAGEN MiniElute PCR purification kit as per manufacturers’ protocol. In parallel, input samples (chromatin from about 50,000 cells) were reverse crosslinked and DNA was isolated following the same protocol.
Library preparation was carried out using Kapa HTP Illumina library preparation reagents, following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 25 μl of ChIP sample was incubated with 45 μl end repair mix at 20°C for 30 min followed by Ampure XP bead purification. A tailing: bead bound sample was incubated with 50 μl buffer enzyme mix at 30°C for 30 min, followed by PEG/NaCl purification. Adaptor ligation: bead-bound sample was incubated with 45 μl buffer enzyme mix and 5 μl of TruSeq DNA adapters (Illumina), for 20°C 15 min, followed by PEG/NaCl purification (twice). Library enrichment: 12 cycles of PCR amplification. Size selection was performed after PCR using a 0.6 × /0.8x ratio of Ampure XP beads (double size selection) set to collect 250–450 bp fragments. ChIP libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 or NovaSeq 6000 platforms at 50 bp single reads or paired-reads.
Murine embryonic stem cell and adult cortex ChIP-seq datasets were obtained from the ENCODE consortium portal ( Davis et al., 2018 14. Davis, C.A. ∙ Hitz, B.C. ∙ Sloan, C.A. ... The Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE): data portal update Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D794-D801 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). E13.5 ganglionic eminence ChIP-seq were obtained from Lindtner et al., 2019 (GSE124936) ( Lindtner et al., 2019 49. Lindtner, S. ∙ Catta-Preta, R. ∙ Tian, H. ... Genomic Resolution of DLX-Orchestrated Transcriptional Circuits Driving Development of Forebrain GABAergic Neurons Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :2048-2063.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). ChIP-seq datasets were processed using the ChIP-seq module of GenPipes (v3.1.2) ( Bourgey et al., 2019 5. Bourgey, M. ∙ Dali, R. ∙ Eveleigh, R. ... GenPipes: an open-source framework for distributed and scalable genomic analyses Gigascience. 2019; 8 :giz037 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, raw reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 3. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (19203) PubMed Google Scholar ) v0.32 to remove adaptor and sequencing-primer associated reads, then aligned to hg19 or mm10 using bwa-mem ( Li and Durbin, 2009 45. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (21358) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v0.7.12) with default parameters. PCR duplicate reads as defined by reads with identical mapping coordinates were then collapsed by Picard (v2.0.1) to produce uniquely aligned reads. Reads were then filtered for mapping quality of > 5. For single-end (SE) 50bp datasets, reads were extended by 250bp. Wiggle tracks are generated using uniquely aligned reads using Homer (v4.9.1) ( Heinz et al., 2010 28. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4927) PubMed Google Scholar ). RPKM was calculated using VisRSeq (v0.9.40) ( Younesy et al., 2015 105. Younesy, H. ∙ Möller, T. ∙ Lorincz, M.C. ... VisRseq: R-based visual framework for analysis of sequencing data BMC Bioinformatics. 2015; 16 :S2 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) or SeqMonk (v1.46) at annotated genes. Promoter is defined as a 5kb centered bin on the transcription start site. Median values were generated for promoter-associated H3K27me3 and H3K27ac in the two subgroups - 1) G34R/V tumors and 2) non-G34R/V IDH1, SETD2, and WT cortical tumors. Z-score was calculated from the median RPKM as 𝑧 − 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 = ( ( 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 − 𝑊 ⁢ 𝑇 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 ) / √ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 + 𝑊 ⁢ 𝑇 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 ) . Z-score > |0.5| were designated as significant changes for ChIP-seq datasets ( Table S3 ). Gene ontology analyses were performed using PANTHER.
H3K27ac ChIP-sequence reads were aligned to the human genome (HG19) using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 41. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (19585) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v2.1.0) under default settings. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard tools generating BAM. Significant peaks were identified using Model- Based Analysis for ChIP-seq (MACS) (v1.4) ( Zhang et al., 2008 106. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (6784) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a p value cutoff of 1e -9 . Peaks were annotated using HOMER ( Heinz et al., 2010 28. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4927) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v3.12) with promoter regions classified as any peak within ± 2.5 kb of a transcriptional start site (TSS), and enhancer region greater than 2.5 kb from a TSS. Peaks were also annotated using ChIP-atlas annotating distal enhancers to genes based upon public CHIA-PET datasets. Super enhancers were identified using the ROSE algorithm with exclusion of peaks within ± 2.5 kb of a TSS and a stitch distance of 12.5 kb.
Core regulatory circuitry (CRC) analysis was used with default parameters to quantify the interaction network of transcription factor (TF) regulation at super enhancers. Briefly, for all promoters within 100 kb, the most acetylated promoter was assigned as the target of the SE (excluding promoters that overlap SEs, which are automatically assigned the target. If there were no active promoters within 100kb, the SE was assigned to the nearest active promoter. All SE-associated promoters annotated to regulate a TF were considered as the node-list for network construction. For any given TF (TFi), the IN degree was defined as the number of TFs with an enriched binding motif at the proximal SE or promoter of TFi. The OUT degree was defined as the number of TF associated SEs containing an enriched binding site for TFi. Within any given SE, enriched TF binding sites were determined at putative nucleosome free regions (valleys) flanked by high levels of H3K27ac. Valleys were calculated using an algorithm adapted from Ramsey et al. (2010) 75. Ramsey, S.A. ∙ Knijnenburg, T.A. ∙ Kennedy, K.A. ... Genome-wide histone acetylation data improve prediction of mammalian transcription factor binding sites Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2071-2075 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar . In these regions, we searched for enriched TF binding sites using the FIMO59 algorithm with TF position weight matrices defined in the TRANSFAC database ( Matys et al. (2006) 58. Matys, V. ∙ Kel-Margoulis, O.V. ∙ Fricke, E. ... TRANSFAC and its module TRANSCompel: transcriptional gene regulation in eukaryotes Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 :D108-D110 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar . An FDR cutoff of 0.01 was used to identify enriched TF binding sites. Hierarchal clustering of core TFs were performed using the heatmap function of R, and Gene Ontology assessment was performed using PANTHER.
In situ Hi-C libraries were generated from patient-derived glioma cell lines (5 million cells each), and murine embryonic brain tissue (1-3 million cells per sample), as described in Rao et al. (2014) 77. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2753) PubMed Google Scholar with minor modifications. Briefly, in situ Hi-C was performed in 7 steps: (1) crosslinking cells with formaldehyde, (2) digesting DNA using a 4-cutter restriction enzyme (DpnII) within intact permeabilized nuclei, (3) filling in, biotinylating the resulting 5′ overhangs and ligating the blunt ends, (4) shearing the DNA, (5) pulling down biotinylated ligation junctions with streptavidin beads, (6) library amplification and (7) analyzing fragments using paired end sequencing. As quality control (QC) steps, efficient sonication was checked by agarose DNA gel electrophoresis and for appropriate size selection by Agilent Bioanalyzer profiles for libraries. For final QC, we performed superficial sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 (∼30M reads/sample) to assess quality of the libraries using percent of reads passing filter, percent of chimeric reads, and percent of forward-reverse pairs. Hi-C libraries were sequenced (paired-end, 125 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.
Hi-C reads were trimmed and assessed for quality control using the Trim Galore package ( Krueger, 2012 38. Krueger, F. Trim Galore 2012 https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ Google Scholar ) (TrimGalore v0.6.5, Cutadapt v2.6 and Fastqc v0.11.9) ( Table S4 ). Reads were then mapped to hg19 or mm10, and filtered for common Hi-C artifacts using HiCUP ( Wingett et al., 2015 102. Wingett, S. ∙ Ewels, P. ∙ Furlan-Magaril, M. ... HiCUP: pipeline for mapping and processing Hi-C data F1000Res. 2015; 4 :1310 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) (HiCUP v0.7.2, Bowtie2 v2.3.5, R v3.6.0_3.9). Analysis of Hi-C libraries and downloaded files was performed using Juicer and associated Juicer Tools ( Durand et al., 2016 17. Durand, N.C. ∙ Robinson, J.T. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ... Juicebox provides a visualization system for Hi-C contact maps with unlimited zoom Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :99-101 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v1.22.01). Contact maps were generated using Juicer with the following parameter: -s DpnII. Map resolution was determined by using Juicer’s “calculate_map_resolution.sh” script. All observed matrices were computed using HOMER, accounting for both the linear distance between two given loci and sequencing depth. Hi-C contact maps and associated annotations were visualized using Juicebox ( Durand et al., 2016 17. Durand, N.C. ∙ Robinson, J.T. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ... Juicebox provides a visualization system for Hi-C contact maps with unlimited zoom Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :99-101 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used the HIFI algorithm ( Cameron et al., 2020 7. Cameron, C.J. ∙ Dostie, J. ∙ Blanchette, M. HIFI: estimating DNA-DNA interaction frequency from Hi-C data at restriction-fragment resolution Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :11 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to process 5-kb resolution Hi-C data to obtain higher accuracy estimates of interaction frequencies, using the following parameters: bandSize = 1000, outputNormalized, boundaryKS = 1000. Virtual 4C plots were derived using HIFI 5 kb resolution heatmaps. Observed/expected ratios were extracted using the dump function in Juicer Tools from HIFI heatmaps, using the following anchor regions: PDGFRA/Pdgfra promoter (chr4:55090000-55105000 in hg19, chr5:75140000-751550000 in mm10), or GSX2/Gsx2 promoter (chr4:54960000-54970000 in hg19, chr5:75070000-75080000 in mm10). TAD boundaries were calculated using robusTAD tool ( Dali et al., 2018 13. Dali, R. ∙ Bourque, G. ∙ Blanchette, M. RobusTAD: A Tool for Robust Annotation of Topologically Associating Domain Boundaries bioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) at a 50kb resolution. For loop quantification, we extracted and calculated the mean interaction values for each 5kb bin at our region of interest with PDGFRA/Pdgfra or GSX2 / Gsx2 promoters. Quantification of interactions within a TAD was computed as the sum of normalized (observed/expected) interaction scores ( Kloetgen et al., 2020 34. Kloetgen, A. ∙ Thandapani, P. ∙ Ntziachristos, P. ... Three-dimensional chromatin landscapes in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :388-400 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) for each cell line, extracted using the dump function from Juicer Tools for the region of interest. Significant differences in intra-TAD activity or interaction loops anchored on PDGFRA or GSX2 promoters were assessed using a one-tailed t test. All related quantification and statistical analyses are provided in Table S4 . Publicly available Hi-C datasets on murine embryonic stem cells were downloaded from GEO (GSE96107) ( Bonev et al., 2017 4. Bonev, B. ∙ Mendelson Cohen, N. ∙ Szabo, Q. ... Multiscale 3D Genome Rewiring during Mouse Neural Development Cell. 2017; 171 :557-572.e24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ), and processed as described above.
To ensure visual clarity for Hi-C heatmaps, we either plotted observed/expected interaction values or observed interaction values alone. When plotting broader windows for the Hi-C interaction heatmaps (e.g., Figure S5 F), we plotted observed values since observed/expected values tend to exaggerate the intensity of long-range interactions. Observed values also allow better visualization of TAD structures across large-scale windows. Similarly, we represented observed values to represent the Gsx2 -hs687 interaction in Figure S5 G because they are better suited for small distances, unlike observed/expected values that tend to underestimate short interactions due to their proximity in the linear genome. By contrast, we represented observed/expected values for mid-range interactions across the PDGFRA -hs687 locus, as depicted in Figures 4 A and 4B.
Fresh tumors collected after surgery were enzymatically digested and mechanically dissociated using the papain version of the Brain Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) or the Worthington Papain dissociation kit ( Table S6 ). Red blood cells were lysed by ammonium chloride treatment for 5 min on ice. Cell viability was assessed with Trypan Blue. For samples with low viability (< 60%), dissociated cells were enriched for live cells using the Dead Cell Removal kit(Miltenyi Biotech). 10,000 dissociated cells per sample were loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium controller. Nuclei were prepared from frozen tissue (5-50 mg) as previously described ( Nagy et al., 2019 61. Nagy, C. ∙ Maitra, M. ∙ Tanti, A. ... Single-nucleus RNA sequencing shows convergent evidence from different cell types for altered synaptic plasticity in major depressive disorder Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 23 :771-781 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ). Nuclei concentration was assessed using the ReadyProbes Cell Viability fluorescence assay (ThermoFisher Scientific). As nuclei capture was 55%–60% less efficient than cell capture, we aimed to capture 22,000 nuclei per sample.
The Chromium Single Cell 3′ (10X Genomics, Version 3) protocol was strictly followed to prepare libraries. The 10X libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq4000 or NovaSeq sequencing platforms ( Table S6 ).
Cell Ranger (10X Genomics) was used with default parameters to demultiplex reads and align sequencing reads to the genome, distinguish cells from background, and obtain gene counts per cell. Alignment was performed using the hg19 reference genome build, coupled with the Ensembl transcriptome (v75). For snRNaseq data, intronic counts were included. For each sample, cells were filtered using the following quality control (QC) metrics ( Table S6 ): mitochondrial content (indicative of cell damage), number of genes, and number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), using the Seurat ( Butler et al., 2018 6. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (2408) PubMed Google Scholar ) package (v2.3). Thresholds for each sample were selected according to the distribution of each metric within the sample, which varies with sequencing coverage and the number of cells captured. Data was processed as described previously ( Jessa et al., 2019 30. Jessa, S. ∙ Blanchet-Cohen, A. ∙ Krug, B. ... Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1702-1713 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Seurat. Briefly, libraries were scaled to 10,000 UMIs per cell and log-normalized. UMI counts and mitochondrial content were regressed from normalized gene counts and the residuals z-scored gene-wise. Dimensionality reduction was performed using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the most variant genes, and PCA was used as input for projection to two dimensions using uniform manifold approximation and projection ( McInnes et al., 2018 59. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. Umap: Uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1802.03426 https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426 Google Scholar ) (UMAP) and clustering using a shared nearest neighbor modularity optimization algorithm ( Waltman and Van Eck, 2013 99. Waltman, L. ∙ Van Eck, N.J. A smart local moving algorithm for large-scale modularity-based community detection Eur. Phys. J. B. 2013; 86 :471 Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar ).
For visualization of single-cell (scRNaseq) and single-nuclei (snRNaseq) datasets in a shared UMAP space as in Figure 5 , cells from all G34R/V tumor datasets were integrated using the method implemented in Seurat ( Stuart et al., 2019 88. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1807) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v3). The resulting matrix was subjected to z-scoring and dimensionality reduction as described above. Only cells identified as malignant (see below) were included in this visualization.
Cell type assignment for each cell was based on projection to the most similar cell type in the normal developing brain, with cell type signatures obtained from the mouse brain scRNaseq atlas ( Jessa et al., 2019 30. Jessa, S. ∙ Blanchet-Cohen, A. ∙ Krug, B. ... Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1702-1713 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), using three different cell type projection methods, detailed below: ( i ) ACTINN ( Ma and Pellegrini, 2020 53. Ma, F. ∙ Pellegrini, M. ACTINN: automated identification of cell types in single cell RNA sequencing Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :533-538 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), ( ii ) pattern correlation, and ( iii ) random sampling ( Filbin et al., 2018 18. Filbin, M.G. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Hovestadt, V. ... Developmental and oncogenic programs in H3K27M gliomas dissected by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2018; 360 :331-335 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar )). Signatures derived from proliferating clusters were excluded from analysis, resulting in 176 gene signatures. Each tumor cell was assigned a cell identity based on the majority vote of the three projection methods. For cells without a majority assignment, the cell identity was imputed based on the assigned cell type for the majority of the ten nearest neighbors obtained using the shared nearest neighbor ( Waltman and Van Eck, 2013 99. Waltman, L. ∙ Van Eck, N.J. A smart local moving algorithm for large-scale modularity-based community detection Eur. Phys. J. B. 2013; 86 :471 Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar ) method implemented in Seurat.
A neural network with three hidden layers ( Ma and Pellegrini, 2020 53. Ma, F. ∙ Pellegrini, M. ACTINN: automated identification of cell types in single cell RNA sequencing Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :533-538 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) designed for assigning cell type in scRNaseq data was trained on single-cell gene expression profiles from the mouse scRNaseq reference atlas. In the reference, the training data was the normalized single-cell gene expression profiles for the 1000 most variable genes, and the training labels were the cell types assigned to each individual cell. The trained neural network was applied to normalized single cell gene expression data for tumor samples.
We adapted a method developed for cell cycle phase assignment in scRNaseq data ( Macosko et al., 2015 56. Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Basu, A. ∙ Satija, R. ... Highly parallel genome-wide expression profiling of individual cells using nanoliter droplets Cell. 2015; 161 :1202-1214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2734) PubMed Google Scholar ) to cell type projection. Given our set of 176 signatures, 𝑆 = { 𝑠 1 , 𝑠 2 , … , 𝑠 1 7 6 } where 𝑠 𝑖 = { 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 1 , 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 2 , 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 3 , … , 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 1 0 0 } , we compute, for each signature 𝑠 𝑖 and for each cell 𝑐 𝑗 , the average normalized expression of all the genes in 𝑠 𝑖 , defining a score 𝑇 𝑠 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 𝑗 . The scores 𝑇 𝑠 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 𝑗 are z-scored across cells to yield normalized scores 𝑁 𝑠 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 𝑗 . Finally, for each cell, the scores 𝑁 𝑠 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 𝑗 are z-scored across signatures to obtain a final score 𝐹 𝑠 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 𝑗 . In the reference atlas, each cluster of cells has a gene signature. Many clusters in the atlas are composed of cell types identified at multiple brain regions or time points (e.g., astrocyte clusters were identified in both brain regions sampled). We therefore define “cell type identity” vectors, representing the 37 distinct cell types captured. Each cell type identity vector is a binary vector of the same length as the signature set 𝑆 , which takes on a value of 1 if the corresponding signature belongs to the given cell type, and 0 otherwise. We then compute, for each cell, the correlation between the final scores 𝐹 𝑐 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑘 and each of the cell type identity vectors. Finally, each cell is assigned the identity of the cell type with the greatest correlation.
We compute a score 𝑇 𝑠 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 𝑗 for each cell as described above. For each signature, this score is compared to the score for a control gene set, computed in an identical manner. To define the control gene set, all detected genes are first binned based on their average expression across the dataset. The control gene set is generated by randomly sampling with replacement 100 genes of similar expression level for each gene in the signature. The final score for each signature is the difference between the score 𝑇 𝑠 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑗 and the score of the control set. Finally, each cell is assigned the identity of signature with the highest final score.
Normalized expression levels for scRNaseq (Smartseq2) datasets of other HGG entities from published studies were downloaded from GEO: IDH1 mutant HGG ( Venteicher et al., 2017 95. Venteicher, A.S. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Hebert, C. ... Decoupling genetics, lineages, and microenvironment in IDH-mutant gliomas by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2017; 355 :eaai8478 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ) (GSE89567), K27M HGG ( Venteicher et al., 2017 95. Venteicher, A.S. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Hebert, C. ... Decoupling genetics, lineages, and microenvironment in IDH-mutant gliomas by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2017; 355 :eaai8478 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ) (GSE102130) and WT HGG ( Neftel et al., 2019 62. Neftel, C. ∙ Laffy, J. ∙ Filbin, M.G. ...

In the latter case, pediatric and adult samples were separated. For each dataset, normalized expression levels were subjected to z-scoring, dimensionality reduction, clustering and cell type projection as described above. Clusters of cells projected to immune cell types were flagged as normal.
Malignant cells within a sample were identified as follows. First, cells from all samples, separately from each technology (scRNaseq and snRNaseq) were pooled and subjected to scaling, dimensionality reduction, cell projection and clustering as described above. Clusters composed of cells projecting to a single cell type and originating from multiple patients were labeled as normal. Specifically, we identified normal clusters as those for which a single patient accounted for at most 75% of the cells/nuclei in the cluster, and for which at least 70% of all the cells/nuclei in the cluster projected to the same cell type. Clusters of cells originating from multiple patients but projecting to different cell types were flagged as low quality and removed from the analysis. Next, copy number alterations (CNV) were inferred on a per sample basis as previously described ( Filbin et al., 2018 18. Filbin, M.G. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Hovestadt, V. ... Developmental and oncogenic programs in H3K27M gliomas dissected by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2018; 360 :331-335 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). For this, the cells labeled as normal as described above were used as reference. In some samples, a clear CNV distinction between normal and malignant cells was not present. In these cases, we identified groups of cells which, (1) clustered together based on transcriptional profiles and (2) were assigned the same cell type based on projections to the reference atlas and (3) no obvious CNV alteration was observed. The cells fulfilling all three criteria were then labeled as normal. Finally, independent CNV calls were obtained with the inferCNV package (v0.8.2) ( Tickle et al., 2020 93. Tickle, T. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Georgescu, C. ... inferCNV of the Trinity CTAT Project Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA., 2020 Google Scholar ) on a per sample basis, using cells labeled as normal pooled from all samples as a combined normal reference, in order to confirm aberrant CNV profiles in malignant cells.
