Title: Distinct Processing of lncRNAs Contributes to Non-conserved Functions in Stem Cells


Abstract: Summary

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) evolve more rapidly than mRNAs. Whether conserved lncRNAs undergo conserved processing, localization, and function remains unexplored. We report differing subcellular localization of lncRNAs in human and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). A significantly higher fraction of lncRNAs is localized in the cytoplasm of hESCs than in mESCs. This turns out to be important for hESC pluripotency. FAST is a positionally conserved lncRNA but is not conserved in its processing and localization. In hESCs, cytoplasm-localized h FAST binds to the WD40 domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP and blocks its interaction with phosphorylated β-catenin to prevent degradation, leading to activated WNT signaling, required for pluripotency. In contrast, m Fast is nuclear retained in mESCs, and its processing is suppressed by the splicing factor PPIE, which is highly expressed in mESCs but not hESCs. These findings reveal that lncRNA processing and localization are previously under-appreciated contributors to the rapid evolution of function.

Section: Introduction

Pervasive transcription of the eukaryotic genome leads to expression of a broad collection of protein-coding and noncoding RNAs. The conservation of sequences of mRNAs as well as those of translated proteins among species is high and functionally significant during evolution ( Makałowski et al., 1996 46.

In contrast, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in general lack high sequence ( Hezroni et al., 2015; Kutter et al., 2012; Necsulea et al., 2014; Ulitsky et al., 2011 26.

Ulitsky, I. Evolution to the rescue: using comparative genomics to understand long non-coding RNAs Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :601-614 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). lncRNA conservation can also occur at the position and mechanism-of-action levels ( Diederichs, 2014; Johnsson et al., 2014; Ulitsky, 2016 19.

Genet. 2016; 17 :601-614 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcription of positionally conserved lncRNAs with nearby conserved coding genes among different species has been recognized as an indicator of potential functional significance ( Amaral et al., 2018; Hezroni et al., 2015; Necsulea et al., 2014; Ulitsky et al., 2011 1.

Conserved function of lincRNAs in vertebrate embryonic development despite rapid sequence evolution Cell. 2011; 147 :1537-1550 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (953) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although mechanisms of action are thought to be associated with specific RNA conformations in cells, analysis of RNA structure still remains a challenge because of the lack of experimental data for essential structural modules ( Ulitsky, 2016 65. Ulitsky, I. Evolution to the rescue: using comparative genomics to understand long non-coding RNAs Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :601-614 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, although increasing numbers of lncRNAs have been recognized to play important roles in diverse cellular processes ( Yao et al., 2019 75. Yao, R.W. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Chen, L.L. Cellular functions of long noncoding RNAs Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :542-551 Crossref Scopus (1009) PubMed Google Scholar ), concerns still remain regarding to what degree their functions are conserved.
The subcellular localization of lncRNAs is related to their function ( Carlevaro-Fita and Johnson, 2019; Chen, 2016 9. Carlevaro-Fita, J. ∙ Johnson, R.

Both cis -elements and trans -factors can affect subcellular localization ( Chin and Lécuyer, 2017; Lubelsky and Ulitsky, 2018; Miyagawa et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014 15. Chin, A. ∙ Lécuyer, E.

Splicing promotes rapid and efficient mRNA export in mammalian cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :3386-3391 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ), which can result in different RNA isoforms with different subcellular fates ( Melé et al., 2017; Schlackow et al., 2017 47.

Cell. 2017; 65 :25-38 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). So far, however, whether lncRNA processing is conserved and how processing contributes to its compartmentalization and function in different species remain unexplored.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass of mammalian blastocyst embryos and possess the ability of self-renewal and differentiation to specific cell types. Although human ESCs (hESCs) and mouse ESCs (mESCs) share some common properties in pluripotency, including high alkaline phosphatase and telomerase activity ( Koestenbauer et al., 2006 32. Koestenbauer, S. ∙ Zech, N.H. ∙ Juch, H. ... Embryonic stem cells: similarities and differences between human and murine embryonic stem cells Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2006; 55 :169-180 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), they have distinct morphologies, stemness markers, growth conditions, and extrinsic signals to maintain their pluripotent state ( Koestenbauer et al., 2006; Pera and Tam, 2010 32. Koestenbauer, S. ∙ Zech, N.H. ∙ Juch, H. ... Embryonic stem cells: similarities and differences between human and murine embryonic stem cells Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2006; 55 :169-180 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Pera, M.F. ∙ Tam, P.P. Extrinsic regulation of pluripotent stem cells Nature. 2010; 465 :713-720 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether lncRNAs contribute to these differences between hESCs and mESCs is unknown.
Here we profiled conserved lncRNAs from hESCs and mESCs to examine whether their processing and subcellular localization are conserved. Surprisingly, we found that the localization pattern of lncRNAs between hESCs and mESCs is different. Conserved lncRNAs in hESCs are more frequently spliced with increased cytoplasmic localization, and this is required for pluripotency regulation and modulated by differential expression of trans -factors. Such distinct RNA processing, localization, and subsequent function have not been sufficiently appreciated previously.

Section: Results

To explore whether sequence or positionally conserved lncRNAs undergo conserved RNA processing and subcellular localization, we retrieved sequence-conserved and positionally conserved lncRNAs in hESC H9 and mESC R1/E (R1) lines and compared their subcellular localization patterns by calculating the cytoplasmic ratio (cyto FPKM / [cyto FPKM + nuc FPKM ]) of each lncRNA, using mRNAs as controls ( Figures 1 A and S1 A).
We first profiled the subcellular localization of all RNAs in H9 and R1 ESCs. Cytosolic and nuclear RNAs were examined by fractionation efficiency ( Figure S1 B), followed by total RNA sequencing after depletion of ribosomal RNAs (Ribo– RNA-seq). Repeated fractionated samples were highly correlated (R > 0.95) ( Figure S1 C). Analysis of cytoplasmic ratios of 4,804 expressed H9 lncRNAs and 3,289 expressed R1 lncRNAs revealed significant subcellular localization differences ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ), whereas the subcellular localization of expressed mRNAs is similar between these two cell types ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ).
We next compared the subcellular localization patterns of sequence-conserved lncRNAs in H9 and R1 ESCs. By aligning human lncRNAs to the R1 genome or vice versa, 122 lncRNAs with 20% or more sequence similarity ( Tang et al., 2017 63. Tang, Z. ∙ Wu, Y. ∙ Yang, Y. ... Comprehensive analysis of long non-coding RNAs highlights their spatio-temporal expression patterns and evolutional conservation in Sus scrofa Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :43166 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) were defined as sequence-conserved lncRNAs ( Figures 1 C and S1 A; Table S2 ). Calculation of the cytoplasmic ratio of these 122 lncRNAs showed that their subcellular localization patterns differ between H9 and R1 cells ( Figure 1 D; Table S2 ), although several well-known lncRNAs ( MALAT1 , NEAT1 , FIRRE , and NORAD ) exhibited similar patterns ( Figures S1 B and S1D). To exclude any concern regarding this 20% threshold, we further analyzed 15%, 30%, 50%, and 80% sequence similarities and found that conserved lncRNAs under each condition (n = 130, 108, 60, and 24, respectively) exhibited stronger cytoplasmic localization patterns in H9 cells than in R1 cells ( Figure S1 E).
Further, we compared the subcellular localization patterns of positionally conserved lncRNAs. We classified GENCODE lncRNA annotations into three sub-groups according to relative transcription directionality and position to nearby protein coding genes: divergent, convergent, and same-strand lncRNAs ( Figures 1 E and S1 A). In general, these positionally transcribed lncRNAs in H9 cells preferred to locate in the cytoplasm compared with the corresponding group of lncRNAs in R1 cells, whereas mRNAs in both cells were preferentially cytoplasmic ( Figure 1 F). We further obtained 229 lncRNAs that are positionally conserved relative to their adjacent conserved mRNAs and promoters ( Figures 1 G and S1 A; Table S3 ). Of note, 151 of 229 lncRNAs ( Figure 1 G) were confirmed with conserved transcription start sites (TSSs) by analyzing the CAGE data ( Fort et al., 2014 21. Fort, A. ∙ Hashimoto, K. ∙ Yamada, D. ..., FANTOM Consortium Deep transcriptome profiling of mammalian stem cells supports a regulatory role for retrotransposons in pluripotency maintenance Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :558-566 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 F).
Remarkably, both sequence-conserved and positionally conserved lncRNAs have distinct subcellular localization patterns in H9 and R1 cells, whereas their conserved mRNAs have similar subcellular distribution patterns ( Figure 1 H). One example, the FOXD3 antisense transcript1 ( FAST ), is shown in Figure S1 G. The distinct subcellular localization patterns of selected lncRNAs (with FPKM ≥ 0.5), including FAST , RAB30-AS1 , UBE2D3-AS1 , and others, in H9 and R1 cells ( Figure 1 I) were validated by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ( Figure 1 J).
These distinct localization patterns of lncRNAs did not seem to be cell-line-specific but, rather, species-specific, as shown by the cytoplasmic localization of the examined FAST , RAB30-AS1 , and UBE2D3-AS1 in additional hESC lines (H1 and CT1) and their nuclear retention in other mESC lines (E14) ( Figure S1 H). Further, different pluripotent (primed versus naive-like) states of mESCs and hESCs under different culture conditions had little effect on the distinct localization patterns of lncRNAs ( Figures 1 K–1N and S1 I). Together, these data reveal that some conserved lncRNAs have distinct subcellular localizations, suggesting altered processing and perhaps different functional potential in human and mouse ESCs.
Subcellular localization of lncRNAs is highly associated with function ( Chen, 2016 11. Chen, L.L. Linking Long Noncoding RNA Localization and Function Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41 :761-772 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (794) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether distinctly localized lncRNAs between hESCs and mESCs lead to distinct biological effects, we designed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down five lncRNAs with the highest specific cytoplasmic localization in H9 cells and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to knock out the corresponding nuclear localized ones in R1 cells, followed by examining ESC self-renewal upon their loss ( Figures S2 A–S2D). Although depletion of all five nuclear lncRNAs had little effect on R1 cell pluripotency, as revealed by expression of the key pluripotency transcription factors OCT4 and NANOG ( Figures S2 A and S2C), impaired expression of five tested cytoplasmic lncRNAs—h FAST , RAB30-AS1 , UBE2D3-AS1 , SNHG14 , and GNAS-AS1 —in H9 cells resulted in altered expression of OCT4 and NANOG ( Figures S2 B and S2D). These results suggest that distinctly localized lncRNAs play different roles in cells and that some cytoplasmic lncRNAs might regulate hESC pluripotency.
Among these examined lncRNAs, FAST is transcribed in the opposite direction from its nearby coding gene FOXD 3 ( Figure 2 A). GENCODE annotation reveals that h FAST has five isoforms ( Figure S2 E), but we detected only one major isoform, which contains three exons in H9 cells ( Figure 2 B). h FAST is 547 nt in length and expressed at ~140 copies per H9 cell ( Figures 2 B and S2 F). GENCODE annotation reveals that m Fast has one isoform ( Figure S2 E), but we detected two isoforms, one of which is the major but unspliced 1,377-nt isoform, and another is a 701-nt spliced isoform ( Figures 2 B and S2 E) in R1 cells. Analysis of these expressed hESC and mESC FAST RNAs shows conservation at three levels: exonic structure, sequence, and position ( Ulitsky, 2016 65. Ulitsky, I. Evolution to the rescue: using comparative genomics to understand long non-coding RNAs Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :601-614 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, h FAST contains an ~65-bp conserved region in the second exon and the second intron junction that matches the first exon and the first intron in m Fast . Second, h FAST has an ~230-nt conserved sequence to the unspliced, major isoform of m Fast and 74% genomic sequence conservation between human and mouse. Finally, FAST is positionally conserved, as shown by having the same transcriptional direction and conserved upstream and downstream sequences ( Figure 2 A).
Although h FAST is quite abundant in H9 cells, other ESC lines and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) ( Choi et al., 2015 16. Choi, J. ∙ Lee, S. ∙ Mallard, W. ... A comparison of genetically matched cell lines reveals the equivalence of human iPSCs and ESCs Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :1173-1181 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S2 G and S2H), it is not expressed or only expressed at low levels in many other non-pluripotent cells and tissues ( Figures S2 I and S2J ). This suggests that it may have a specific role in pluripotency or differentiation. We found that FAST expression was rapidly decreased during H9 ectoderm, trophoblast, and mesoderm differentiation ( Figure S3 A) and upon R1 spontaneous differentiation ( Figure S3 B). Although h FAST is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, we excluded the possibility that it could encode functional peptides by inserting a FLAG tag into its predicted open reading frame (ORF) ( Figure S3 C). Together, these findings suggest that h FAST plays a role in maintenance of hESC pluripotency, consistent with impaired pluripotent gene expression upon h FAST depletion ( Figure S2 D).
To examine the effect of h FAST on hESC pluripotency maintenance, we depleted h FAST by two shRNAs ( Figures 2 C and S3 D). h FAST KD significantly impaired H9 colony formation ability ( Figure 2 D), and h FAST knockdown (KD) colonies showed strong spontaneous differentiation under mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) and MEF-free conditions after 3–4 passages ( Figure 2 E). Immunofluorescence (IF), western blot (WB), and qRT-PCR analyses showed that h FAST KD impaired expression of the core transcription factors OCT4 and NANOG ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S2 D). h FAST KD in CT1 and H1 hESCs also reduced OCT4 and NANOG expression ( Figure S3 E) and impaired the colony formation ability of CT1 cells ( Figure S3 F). Similar results were also observed using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out h FAST in H9 cells ( Figures 2 H–2J).
To ask whether h FAST could affect expression of other genes besides OCT4 and NANOG , we collected RNAs from duplicate experiments using scrambled or h FAST KD cells for RNA-seq analyses and found that many genes related to maintenance of stem cell pluripotency were downregulated ( Figure 2 K; Table S4 ). Comparison of our h FAST KD RNA-seq datasets with other published datasets in H1 and H9 cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) ( Choi et al., 2015 16. Choi, J. ∙ Lee, S. ∙ Mallard, W. ... A comparison of genetically matched cell lines reveals the equivalence of human iPSCs and ESCs Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :1173-1181 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ) also revealed that h FAST KD impaired expression of many pluripotency-related genes, with 67% overlap of the downregulated genes in these additional datasets ( Figures S3 G and S3H). Importantly, expression of OCT4 and NANOG could be rescued to normal levels by ectopic expression of h FAST in H9 cells ( Figure 2 L).
Because of the different subcellular localization patterns, we hypothesized that FAST in hESCs and mESCs has different functions. Generation of two m Fast KO clones by CRISPR/Cas9 showed no effect on Oct 4 and Nanog expression at the mRNA or protein levels ( Figures 2 M and 2N). Collectively, these data show that h FAST , but not m Fast , plays a critical role in pluripotency maintenance.
Maintenance of pluripotency is affected by a number of signaling pathways ( Pera and Tam, 2010 54. Pera, M.F. ∙ Tam, P.P. Extrinsic regulation of pluripotent stem cells Nature. 2010; 465 :713-720 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ). We analyzed six pathways known to be required for stemness and found that WNT signaling showed significant enrichment with altered expression of WNT target genes in h FAST KD cells ( Figures 3 A and S4 A). We performed tRSA-RNA pulldown assay ( Xing et al., 2017 72. Xing, Y.H. ∙ Yao, R.W. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... SLERT Regulates DDX21 Rings Associated with Pol I Transcription Cell. 2017; 169 :664-678.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ) to examine whether some key factors in WNT signaling, such as β-TrCP, GSK-3α/β, Axin1, β-catenin, and LPR6, can interact with h FAST . The results showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP was specifically associated with h FAST ( Figure 3 B). RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) confirmed its interaction with h FAST ( Figure 3 C). Also, purified FLAG-β-TrCP expressed from E. coli ( Figure S4 B) could directly bind to h FAST in vitro ( Figure 3 D).
To find out how h FAST interacts with β-TrCP, we used in vitro assays ( Figure S4 C) to first arbitrarily generate a series of h FAST fragments ~100 nt in length, with 30- to 40-nt overlapping sequences between the adjacent fragments ( Figure S4 D). Each in vitro transcribed digoxin (Dig)-labeled h FAST fragment was incubated with partially purified FLAG-β-TrCP from 293FT cells, and eluted RNAs were resolved by denaturing PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Dig antibodies ( Figure S4 C). We found that two 100-nt fragments (F1 and F6) from the 5′ and 3′ ends of h FAST specifically interacted with β-TrCP ( Figure S4 D). Longer h FAST fragments that span different regions (F1–F3, F3–F5, F5–F6, and F6–F7) resulted in similar observations but also revealed an additional binding domain spanning F3–F5 ( Figure S4 E).
These results inspired us to further explore h FAST in vivo structural conformation by carrying out in-cell selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) ( Smola et al., 2015 61. Smola, M.J. ∙ Rice, G.M. ∙ Busan, S. ... Selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) for direct, versatile and accurate RNA structure analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :1643-1669 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 E). SHAPE-MaP revealed that h FAST tended to form several independent stem loops ( Figures 3 F and S4 F), including fragments F1 and F6 ( Figures S4 D and S4E). This conformation was determined in cells but could be different in the absence of cellular proteins. Nevertheless, generation of h FAST fragments according to its secondary loop regions revealed by in-cell SHAPE-MaP ( Figures 3 F and 3G), followed by performing binding assay with β-TrCP, revealed that h FAST is a multivalent β-TrCP binding platform via five individual loop regions ( Figures 3 G and S4 G).
Next we asked which domain of β-TrCP interacts with h FAST . β-TrCP belongs to the Fbw (F-box/WD40 repeat-containing) protein family, with an F-box motif at the N terminus and seven WD40 repeats at the C terminus ( Fuchs et al., 2004 22. Fuchs, S.Y. ∙ Spiegelman, V.S. ∙ Kumar, K.G. The many faces of beta-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligases: reflections in the magic mirror of cancer Oncogene. 2004; 23 :2028-2036 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated a series of β-TrCP truncations lacking the F-box motif, the WD40 repeats, the linker between these two domains, or truncations of different repeats from the WD40 domain ( Figure 3 H). We performed assay, as illustrated in Figure S4 C, and found that β-TrCP interacted with h FAST mainly via the WD40 repeat domain ( Figure 3 I) and with a linear correlation ( Figure 3 J). The direct interaction between h FAST and β-TrCP was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) ( Figure S4 H). The spliced and unspliced isoforms of m Fast failed to interact with mouse β-TrCP ( Figure S4 I), suggesting that m Fast is not involved in WNT signaling, consistent with the loss-of-function studies shown in Figures 2 M and 2N.
Is h FAST sufficiently abundant to affect levels of β-TrCP involved in WNT signaling in hESCs? It has been reported that each HeLa cell has 9,602 copies of β-TrCP, as assayed by quantitative proteomics ( Hein et al., 2015 25. Hein, M.Y. ∙ Hubner, N.C. ∙ Poser, I. ... A human interactome in three quantitative dimensions organized by stoichiometries and abundances Cell. 2015; 163 :712-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (900) PubMed Google Scholar ). WB of β-TrCP in HeLa and H9 cells suggested ~8,173 copies of β-TrCP in H9 cells ( Figure S4 J). IF imaging further showed that 40% of β-TrCP was localized to the cytoplasm ( Figure S4 K), indicating ~3,269 copies of β-TrCP in the cytoplasm per H9 cell. Given the observations that each H9 cell contains ~140 copies of h FAST ( Figure S2 F), mostly in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1 K), and that each binds five β-TrCP molecules ( Figures 3 F and 3G), then, theoretically, more than 20% of the cytoplasmic β-TrCP can be bound by h FAST . Importantly, h FAST barely interacted with other WD40 domain-containing proteins, such as WDR26 or STRAP ( Figures 3 K–3M and S4 L), that act in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways ( Seong et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2004 60.

WNT signaling in hESCs pluripotency is stage specific and cell context dependent ( Nusse and Clevers, 2017; Sato et al., 2004; Sokol, 2011; Wray and Hartmann, 2012 53. Nusse, R. ∙ Clevers, H.

WNTing embryonic stem cells Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22 :159-168 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate WNT signaling in our hESCs, we treated H9, H1, and CT1 cells with BIO (6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime) and CHIR99021, inhibitors of GSK3α/β, to activate WNT signaling ( Lian et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2004 38. Lian, X. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Azarin, S.M. ... Directed cardiomyocyte differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells by modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling under fully defined conditions Nat.

Maintenance of pluripotency in human and mouse embryonic stem cells through activation of Wnt signaling by a pharmacological GSK-3-specific inhibitor Nat. Med. 2004; 10 :55-63 Crossref Scopus (1790) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the levels of β-catenin ( Figure S5 A), the WNT target genes AXIN2 and CD44 , and the pluripotency-related genes OCT4 and NANOG ( Figure S5 B) increased after BIO or CHIR99021 treatment. Also, depleting components of the destruction complex is known to activate the WNT pathway ( Major et al., 2007 45. Major, M.B. ∙ Camp, N.D. ∙ Berndt, J.D. ... Wilms tumor suppressor WTX negatively regulates WNT/beta-catenin signaling Science. 2007; 316 :1043-1046 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ). Axin1 KD showed the same results as BIO or CHIR99021 treatment ( Figure S5 C). Depletion of β-catenin also led to decreased expression of OCT4 and NANOG ( Figure S5 D). Together, these results confirm that WNT signaling plays a positive role in regulating hESC pluripotency.
Next we investigated how the interaction between h FAST and β-TrCP regulates hESC pluripotency. The WD40 domain of β-TrCP not only has RNA binding activity ( Castello et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2016 10. Castello, A. ∙ Fischer, B. ∙ Eichelbaum, K. ... Insights into RNA biology from an atlas of mammalian mRNA-binding proteins Cell. 2012; 149 :1393-1406 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1571) PubMed Google Scholar 28.

Structural basis for snRNA recognition by the double-WD40 repeat domain of Gemin5 Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :2391-2403 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) but is also required for recognition of phosphorylated β-catenin ( Wu et al., 2003 70. Wu, G. ∙ Xu, G. ∙ Schulman, B.A. ... Structure of a beta-TrCP1-Skp1-beta-catenin complex: destruction motif binding and lysine specificity of the SCF(beta-TrCP1) ubiquitin ligase Mol. Cell. 2003; 11 :1445-1456 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because h FAST and phosphorylated β-catenin can both interact with the WD40 repeat domain of β-TrCP, we speculated that h FAST might inhibit β-TrCP recognition of phosphorylated β-catenin, leading to β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus to keep WNT signaling active in normal cells ( Figure 4 A). In this model, depletion of h FAST would facilitate β-TrCP recognition of phosphorylated β-catenin and result in β-catenin degradation by proteasomes ( Figure 4 A). Experimentally, h FAST KD by shRNAs or CRISPR/Cas9 led to decreased β-catenin protein levels ( Figure S5 E) in the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Figure 4 B). Further, loss of h FAST enhanced the ubiquitination of β-catenin ( Figure 4 C), suggesting that h FAST inhibits β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation by binding β-TrCP.
Axin1 is a skeleton component of the destruction complex that controls β-catenin stability in WNT signaling ( Nusse and Clevers, 2017 53. Nusse, R. ∙ Clevers, H. Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling, Disease, and Emerging Therapeutic Modalities Cell. 2017; 169 :985-999 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2939) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculated that the interaction between β-TrCP and the destruction complex should be enhanced in the absence of h FAST ( Figure 4 A). In vitro immunoprecipitation (IP) of Axin1 in h FAST KD cells showed enhanced interaction between β-TrCP and the destruction complex ( Figure 4 D). Further, in vitro IP of FLAG-β-TrCP in h FAST overexpression (OE) 293FT cells revealed that h FAST prevented β-TrCP from recognizing phosphorylated β-catenin ( Figure 4 E). As a result, h FAST KD impaired expression of the WNT target genes AXIN2 and CD44 in hESCs ( Figure 4 F); OE of h FAST ( Figure 4 G), but not m Fast ( Figure S5 F), rescued AXIN2 and CD44 expression. Activation of WNT signaling by BIO or CHIR99021 in multiple hESC lines rescued h FAST KD phenotypes ( Figures 4 H, 4I, S5 G, and S5H), further establishing WNT signaling as the mechanism of h FAST pluripotency maintenance in hESCs. Collectively, these results led us to conclude that loss of h FAST results in reduced WNT signaling, driving hESCs out of the pluripotent state.
We also asked whether exogenously expressed h FAST could regulate WNT signaling in other cell types. 293FT cells have no detectable h FAST ( Figures S5 I and S2 J). Exogenous expression of h FAST in 293FT cells increased β-catenin levels, and in these cells, h FAST could interact with β-TrCP ( Figures S5 I–S5K). Consistently, WNT signaling target genes were also upregulated ( Figure S5 L). On the other hand, exogenous expression of m Fast had no effect on expression of β-catenin and WNT target genes ( Figures S5 I, S5J, and S5L). These findings are in accordance with the observation that m Fast did not bind to β-TrCP in vitro ( Figure S4 I).
RNA splicing affects subcellular localization ( Valencia et al., 2008 67. Valencia, P. ∙ Dias, A.P. ∙ Reed, R. Splicing promotes rapid and efficient mRNA export in mammalian cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :3386-3391 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, splicing is more suppressed in nuclear retained lncRNAs in mESCs compared with hESCs ( Figure S6 A). Further, m Fast is retained in the nucleus in mESCs, whereas h FAST is fully spliced and exported to the cytoplasm ( Figures 1 J–1N, S1 H, and 2 B). These distinct localizations of lncRNAs suggested that RNA splicing or additional trans -factors might contribute to their distinct localization between H9 and R1 cells. To test this possibility, we introduced exogenous h FAST or m Fast into H9 or R1 cells, respectively, by lentivirus infection. h FAST and m Fast were stably expressed at comparable levels ( Figure S6 B); intriguingly, they both localized to the cytoplasm in H9 cells, whereas both were more nuclear in R1 cells ( Figures S6 C–S6F). These results were validated by single-molecule (sm)FISH ( Figures 5 A and 5B), where h FAST was strikingly retained in the nucleus in R1 cells, and m Fast became cytoplasmic in H9 cells. Transient expression of h FAST and m Fast also exhibited the same results ( Figure S6 G). Such distinct subcellular localization of exogenously expressed h FAST and m Fast in hESCs and mESCs suggests that the differentially expressed trans -factor(s), but not cis -elements, contribute primarily to differential localization.
To explore which trans -factor(s) might regulate distinct FAST processing and export in H9 and R1 cells, we first computationally analyzed potential h FAST and m Fast binding proteins. We fetched h FAST and m Fast pre-RNA sequences to predict their potential binding proteins using the ATtRACT database and found that 75 common proteins might interact with both h FAST and m Fast ( Figure 5 C; Table S5 ). According to the highly enriched predicted binding sites and known functions in RNA processing, we selected 10 RNA binding protein (RBPs) that have the potential to bind both h FAST and m Fast but are differentially expressed in H9 and R1 cells, as shown by RNA-seq data ( Figures 5 D and 5E; Table S5 ). We speculated that those more highly expressed in R1 cells may suppress RNA processing and export, whereas those more highly expressed in H9 cells may enhance RNA splicing and export ( Figure 5 F). Accordingly, if RBPs suppress lncRNA export, then their KD should decrease the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio (N/C); if these RBPs enhance lncRNA export, then KD should increase N/C distribution ( Figure 5 F). After KD ( Figure S7 A), N/C distribution was monitored by qRT-PCR ( Figure 5 G). Among all examined factors, KD of the differently expressed PPIE led to the most dramatically decreased m Fast N/C distribution ( Figure 5 G) in H9 m Fast OE cells, indicating that PPIE is at least one factor that suppresses m Fast export to the cytoplasm.
How does PPIE regulate RNA export in these cells? PPIE belongs to the peptidyl-prolyl cis - trans isomerase (PPIase) family, and several members of this family have been identified as part of the spliceosome and are essential for splicing ( Bertram et al., 2017; Bessonov et al., 2008; Schiene-Fischer, 2015 2. Bertram, K. ∙ Agafonov, D.E. ∙ Liu, W.T. ... Cryo-EM structure of a human spliceosome activated for step 2 of splicing Nature. 2017; 542 :318-323 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar 3. Bessonov, S. ∙ Anokhina, M. ∙ Will, C.L. ... Isolation of an active step I spliceosome and composition of its RNP core Nature. 2008; 452 :846-850 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Schiene-Fischer, C. Multidomain Peptidyl Prolyl cis/trans Isomerases Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1850 :2005-2016 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). PPIE is highly conserved between human and mouse and has an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and PPIase cyclophilin-type domain ( Figure S7 B). The expression level of mouse Ppie in R1 cells is much higher than that of human PPIE in H9 cells ( Figures 5 H, S7 C, S7D, and S7J), which accords with our hypothesis that highly expressed Ppie in R1 cells suppresses lncRNA processing and export. PPIE is an abundant protein ( Figures S7 C and S7D) that is localized to the nucleus in H9 and R1 cells ( Figure S7 E).
Consistent with predicted PPIE binding to pre-h FAST or pre-m Fast ( Figures 5 D and S7 F), PPIE interacted with h FAST or m Fast mature or precursor transcripts ( Figures S7 G–S7I). PPIE KD ( Figure S7 J) resulted in a decreased endogenous m Fast or h FAST N/C distribution ( Figure 5 I). Consistently, loss of Ppie increased the level of the m Fast spliced isoform and promoted its export to the cytoplasm ( Figures 5 J and S7 K). Pre-m Fast was also reduced upon Ppie KD ( Figure S7 M), further indicating that loss of Ppie increased m Fast processing. Re-introducing Ppie into Ppie KD R1 cells rescued m Fast nuclear processing and localization ( Figures S7 L and S7M). smRNA FISH of exogenously expressed m Fast confirmed reduced nuclear localization after Ppie KD in R1 cells ( Figures 5 K and 5L). Importantly, Ppie KD also reduced the N/C distribution of a number of other positionally conserved lncRNAs in R1 cells, which can be largely rescued by re-introducing Ppie into Ppie KD cells ( Figure 5 M). RNA-seq analysis of fractionated Ppie KD R1 cells further revealed that Ppie had a broader effect on nuclear retention of lncRNAs than mRNAs ( Figure 5 N; Table S6 ). Taken together, these results suggest that the differentially expressed splicing suppressor PPIE contributes to the distinct localization of a subgroup of lncRNAs, including FAST , between H9 and R1 cells.
FAST is highly conserved between human and monkey, having 94% sequence similarity ( Figure 6 A). Northern blotting revealed that cem FAST (534 nt) is highly expressed and processed in the crab-eating macaque ESC M21 line ( Figure 6 B). Similar to that in hESCs ( Figures 1 J–1N), the processed cem FAST is largely localized to the cytoplasm of M21 cells ( Figure 6 C). Loss of cem FAST impaired the expression of NANOG and OCT4 in M21 cells ( Figures 6 D and 6E), indicating impaired pluripotency. These results suggest that processing, localization, and function of FAST are conserved among primates but distinct from that of rodents. Consistently, PPIE expression in M21 as well as rhesus macaque ESC LYON-1 cells is slightly higher than in hECSs but to a much lower degree than in mESCs, as shown by mRNA and protein levels ( Figures 6 F–6H, S7 C, S7D, and S7J). In addition to FAST , a number of other conserved lncRNAs tended to have increased splicing capability from mouse to monkey and human ES cell lines ( Figure 6 I).

Section: Discussion

Analysis of lncRNA conservation has revealed that lncRNAs are rapidly evolving ( Nitsche and Stadler, 2017; Ulitsky, 2016 52. Nitsche, A. ∙ Stadler, P.F. Evolutionary clues in lncRNAs Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2017; 8 :e1376 Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar 65. Ulitsky, I. Evolution to the rescue: using comparative genomics to understand long non-coding RNAs Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :601-614 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). The less constrained conservation and rapid evolutionary turnover of lncRNAs make it difficult to dissect their functions and mechanisms of action. Subcellular localization is clearly related to function ( Chen, 2016; Ulitsky, 2016 11. Chen, L.L. Linking Long Noncoding RNA Localization and Function Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41 :761-772 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (794) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Ulitsky, I. Evolution to the rescue: using comparative genomics to understand long non-coding RNAs Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :601-614 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we found that, in human and mouse stem cells, most conserved lncRNAs exhibit distinct patterns of subcellular localization compared to conserved mRNAs, unlikely dependent on culture conditions ( Figures 1 and S1 ). Importantly, the different processing and localization of conserved lncRNAs lead to distinct functions in ESCs derived from monkey and human compared to mESCs ( Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and S2–S7 ), suggesting a new layer of understanding regarding the rapid evolution of lncRNAs and that the relatively high evolutionary plasticity of lncRNAs can support species-specific gene expression programs ( Figure 7 ).
Intriguingly, we found that conserved lncRNAs in mESCs in general exhibited enhanced nuclear retention compared with those in hESCs ( Figures 1 C–1N), and this correlated with less efficient splicing ( Figures S6 A and 6I). Seeking mechanisms that contribute to this specific lncRNA localization pattern revealed that differential expression of trans -regulators, such as PPIE, acts to regulate these differences ( Figures 5 , 6 , S6 , and S7 ). PPIE expression is decreased from mouse to primates ( Figures 6 F–6H and S7 C–S7D), and this is accompanied by increased processing of conserved lncRNAs ( Figures 1 , 6 C, and 6I). These observations suggest the possibility that gaining processing of lncRNA, such as FAST , is achieved by escaping the inhibitory effect of PPIE in the processing machinery during evolution. It remains to be determined how PPIE suppresses RNA processing in different types of cells. Given the abundance of PPIE (i.e., ~80,000 per H9 cell [ Figure S7 C] versus ~280,000 per R1 cell [ Figure S7 D]), it is possible that PPIE may form different, yet-to-be-defined complexes in H9 and R1 cells that are required for distinct RNA processing, even though PPIE alone could interact with pre-h FAST in H9 cell lysates ( Figure S7 H). Although the splicing suppressor PPIE likely accounts for the nuclear localization of many lncRNAs in mESCs ( Figures 5 , S6 , and S7 ), other RBPs may also affect differential localization and remain to be identified.
Fully processed h FAST is located in the cytoplasm of hESCs ( Figures 1 J–1N and 6 A) and is a previously uncharacterized lncRNA required for WNT signaling and pluripotency by blocking the interaction between β-TrCP and phosphorylated β-catenin, resulting in suppressed β-catenin degradation and WNT activation ( Figures 3 and 4 ). However, m Fast does not interact with β-TrCP or affect mESC pluripotency ( Figures 2 M, 2N, S4 I, and S2 C). These findings suggest another new mechanism that differs in hESCs and mESCs. However, although expressed at low levels and primarily located in the nucleus, we cannot yet conclude that m Fast has no function, only that it does not appear to play a role in WNT signaling or pluripotency maintenance. Because recent studies have shown that lncRNAs can recruit or block transcriptional factors from WNT target genes ( Di Cecilia et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2016 18. Di Cecilia, S. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ Sancho, A. ... RBM5-AS1 Is Critical for Self-Renewal of Colon Cancer Stem-like Cells Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :5615-5627 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Ma, Y. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Wang, F. ... Long non-coding RNA CCAL regulates colorectal cancer progression by activating Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway via suppression of activator protein 2α Gut. 2016; 65 :1494-1504 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ), additional uncharacterized lncRNAs may act to regulate WNT signaling in mESCs.
The difference in subcellular localization of conserved lncRNAs between hESCs, monkey ESCs, and mESCs is remarkable ( Figures 1 , 5 , and 6 ). In addition to the observation that differential nuclear retention of lncRNAs in mESCs and hESCs is functionally associated with pluripotency maintenance, as shown for h FAST in WNT singling regulation ( Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 ), it is possible that some cells may display stronger nuclear retention of lncRNAs than others and that such differentially processed lncRNAs may contribute to different functional outputs. Future studies are needed to investigate more general ramifications of this phenomenon in pluripotency and in other contexts.

The reversion of primed hESCs to a naive-like state was performed by culturing H9 cells under RSeT Feeder-Free Medium (STEMCELL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. H9 cells were split into small colonies with dispase and passaged on Matrigel coated dish with CM for 24 hours. Then CM was removed by adding 2mL RSeT Feeder-Free Medium and the cells were incubated at 37°C under hypoxic conditions. After 6 days reversion in RSeT Feeder-Free Medium, H9 cells were passaged by TrypLE and maintained in RSeT Feeder-Free Medium with 5 μM Y27632 for 24 hours, followed by replacing RSeT Feeder-Free Medium every day. The reverting efficiency was monitered by increased expression of naive-like associated genes (an example was shown in Figure S1 I).
Differentiation of EpiLCs from mouse ESCs was performed as previously described ( Hayashi et al., 2011 24. Hayashi, K. ∙ Ohta, H. ∙ Kurimoto, K. ... Reconstitution of the mouse germ cell specification pathway in culture by pluripotent stem cells Cell. 2011; 146 :519-532 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1053) PubMed Google Scholar ). EpiLCs were induced by plating 2.5 × 10 5 R1 ESCs on a 6-well plate coated with 16.7 mg/mL human plasma fibronectin in N2B27 medium containing 20 ng/mL activin A, 12 ng/mL bFGF and KSR (1%). The medium was changed every day maintained for two days.

To knock down h FAST , other lncRNAs or mRNAs, DNA sequences for shRNAs were designed by the GPP Web Portal online tool ( https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/ ). DNA oligos of shRNA sequences for targeted RNAs or scramble shRNAs were individually cloned into pLKO.1-TRC vector ( Moffat et al., 2006 49. Moffat, J. ∙ Grueneberg, D.A. ∙ Yang, X. ... A lentiviral RNAi library for human and mouse genes applied to an arrayed viral high-content screen Cell. 2006; 124 :1283-1298 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1452) PubMed Google Scholar ). To construct plasmids to detect h FAST protein-coding ability, predicted ORFs were individually cloned into pcDNA3 vector. Flag sequence (GACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAG) was knocked-in the three continuous nucleotides downstream of the predicted small ORFs and plasmids were constructed by mutant PCR. To construct plasmids for overexpressing h FAST or m Fast , the full length sequence flanked by its natural intron, splicing sites and exons was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of H9 or R1 cells and was cloned into the p23-phage vector. To construct plasmids to overexpress flag-tagged β-TrCP, its CDS sequence was amplified from H9 cDNA library. Truncated β-TrCP plasmids were constructed using Mut Express MultiS Fast Mutagenesis Kit (Vazyme C213-01). To construct plasmids for protein expression and purification, the full length of β-TrCP CDS sequence with Flag-tagged at its N-terminal was amplified from the H9 cDNA library and cloned into the pC013 vector. The full length of human or mouse PPIE CDS sequence with the Flag-tagged at its N-terminal was amplified from H9 or R1 cDNA libraries and cloned into the pET-28a vector. All plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Primers for plasmid constructions were listed in Table S7 .
To produce lentiviral particles, 5 × 10 6 293FT cells in a 10 cm dish were co-transfected with 10 μg pLKO.1 shRNA, 7.5 μg of psPAX2 and 3 μg pMD2.G plasmids. The supernatant containing viral particles was harvested twice at 48h and 72h after transfection, then filtered through Millex-GP Filter Unit (0.22 μm pore size, Millipore). Viral particles were concentrated about 100-fold by Lenti-Concention Virus Precipitation Solution (ExCell Bio), resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, and stored at −80°C until use.
For protein purification, Flag-tagged β-TrCP was cloned into the bacterial expression pC013 vector (6x His/Twin Strep SUMO, a pET-based expression vector) and was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL21 [Transetta (DE3) chemically competent cell (TRANSGEN BIOTECH, CD801)]. After transformation, a single colony was inoculated in 10 mL LB media supplemented with 100 μg/L ampicillin at 250 rpm, 37°C. After overnight growth, the culture was diluted 100-fold into 1L LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/L ampicillin. Absorbance was monitored at a wavelength of 600 nm, and upon reaching an optical density (OD600) of 0.6 - 0.8, IPTG was added to the LB medium at the final concentration of 0.2 mM for the induction of protein expression. After overnight incubation at 250 rpm, 16°C, cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C), resuspended in the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0) supplemented with 1 mg/mL lysozyme on ice for 30 min, and sonicated for 10 min (5 s on/off) on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, the supernatant cell lysate was applied to StrepTactin Sepharose (GE) and incubated with rotation for 2 hours at 4°C. The protein-bound Sepharose was washed three times with lysis buffer. The Sepharose was resuspended in SUMO digest buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl 1 mM DTT, 0.15% Igepal (NP-40), pH 8.0) along with 100 Units of SUMO protease (ThermoFisher) and incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. The concentration of purified protein was determined using Modified Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech, C503041) and checked by Coomassie blue staining.
Total RNA from each cultured cell line or cultured cells with different treatments was extracted with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For qRT-PCR, after treatment with DNase I (Invitrogen, DNA-free kit), the cDNA synthesis was carried out using PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR was carried out using SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO) and a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Aplied Biosysterms). The relative expression of different sets of genes was quantified to Actin mRNA. The relative N/C ratio was calculated by normalizing cytoplasmic RNA to gapdh mRNA and nuclear RNA to U6 RNA.
NB was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol (DIG Northern Starter Kit, Roche). RNA was loaded on native agarose gels or denatured PAGE gels. Digoxigenin (Dig) labeled antisense probes were generated using T7 RNA polymerase or SP6 RNA polymerase by in vitro transcription with the RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega). All primers used for qRT-PCR or probes were listed in Table S7 .
Fractionation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA in H9 and R1 cells was performed as described ( Chen et al., 2008 13. Chen, L.L. ∙ DeCerbo, J.N. ∙ Carmichael, G.G. Alu element-mediated gene silencing EMBO J. 2008; 27 :1694-1705 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. 1 × 10 6 cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellet was suspended by gentle pipetting in 200 mL lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Igepal, 2 mM Ribonucleoside Vanadyl Complex), and incubated on ice for 5 min. During the incubation, one fifth of the lysate was added to 1 mL Trizol for total RNA extraction. The rest of the lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 3 min at 4°C to pellet the nuclei and the supernatant was the cytoplasmic fraction. To obtain pure cytoplasmic RNA, the supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 14,000rpm for 10 min at 4°C and then collected the supernatant carefully to a new tube and extracted the RNA with Trizol. To obtain pure nuclear RNA, nuclear pellets underwent additional wash with 200 μL lysis buffer, one additional wash by adding 0.5% deoxycholic acid into the lysis buffer. Finally, the purified nuclei were resuspended in 200 μL lysis buffer followed by extraction with Trizol. Fractionated RNA from the same amounts of cells was used for cDNA production, qRT-PCR, PCR and RNA-seq analysis.
Linear RNA was in vitro transcribed from T7 expression vector prepared by RiboMax large RNA production system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with slight modifications. Briefly, 1 μg PCR-amplified T7- DNA fragments were incubated with 2 μL T7 RNA polymerase enzyme and 0.5 mM Dig labeled dNTPs (Roache). In vitro transcription was carried out for 3 hr at 37°C, followed by DNase I treatment for 30 min at 37°C to remove DNA templates. Transcribed RNA was precipitated with ethanol and washed with 75% ethanol and resuspended in RNase-free water. For in vitro transcribed RNA purification, 10 μg transcribed RNA was resolved on denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Ethidium bromide staining. Corresponding bands on denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel were excised for further purification.
tRSA RNA pull-down assays were carried out as described ( Xing et al., 2017 72. Xing, Y.H. ∙ Yao, R.W. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... SLERT Regulates DDX21 Rings Associated with Pol I Transcription Cell. 2017; 169 :664-678.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Full-length h FAST was cloned into pcDNA3 plasmid with the tRSA tag at its 5′end. RNA product was in vitro transcribed using the T7 RiboMAX Large-Scale RNA Production System (Promega). 10 mg per reaction of synthetic RNA was denatured for 5 min at 65°C in RNA Structure buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2) and slowly cooled down to room temperature. Then, folded RNA was incubated with 50 mL of streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 4°C in the presence of 2 U/mL RNasin (Promega). H9 cells (2x10 7 ) were harvested and resuspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer [10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail (MedChem Express)] followed by sonication for 4x10s with an interval of 1 min on ice and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was pre-cleared with 50 mL of streptavidin Dynabeads for 20 min at 4°C followed by the addition of 20 mg/mL yeast tRNA for 20 min at 4°C. Then the pre-cleared lysate was added to folded RNAs and incubated for 3.5 hr at 4°C followed by washing 4x5 min with wash buffer [10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail (MedChem Express), 2 mM RVC]. To harvest the protein complex, 50 mL of 1x SDS loading buffer was added and boiled for 10 min at 100°C. Retrieved proteins were analyzed by WB with primary antibodies.
Cells growing in 10 cm dishes were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested in 10 mL ice-cold PBS and then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL RIP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Igepal, 1 mM PMSF, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (MedChem Express) and 2 mM VRC) and subjected to three rounds of gentle sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatants were precleared with 15 mL Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) to get rid of non-specific binding. Then, the precleared lysates were used for IP with anti-Flag antibodies (Sigma) or anti-β-TrCP antibodies (CST). IP was carried out for 2 hours at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with high salt buffer and two times with the RIP buffer, followed by extraction with elution buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, and 10mM EDTA) at room temperature for 10 min. One-third of the eluted sample was used for WB and the remaining was used for RNA extraction. The RNA enrichment was assessed by qRT-PCR.
In vitro synthesized and purified linear h FAST and egfp RNAs were heated for 5 min at 65°C in RNA folding buffer (10 mM HEPES and 10 mM MgCI 2 ) and slowly cooled down to room temperature. Purified flag-tagged-β-TrCP protein were incubated with Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) for 1h at at 4°C in 0.2 mL binding buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0, 150 mM NaC1, 10 mM MgC1 2 , 0.1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2mM RVC). After washing with binding buffer, equal molecular amounts of folded RNAs were added to incubate with binding beads for 2h at 4°C in 0.2 mL binding buffer. After incubation and washing, RNAs were extracted with Trizol (Life technologies) and the abundance of RNAs bound to flag-tagged-β-TrCP protein was revealed by denatured PAGE gel.
Dig-RNA pull-down assays were carried out as described ( Hu et al., 2015 27. Hu, S.B. ∙ Xiang, J.F. ∙ Li, X. ... Protein arginine methyltransferase CARM1 attenuates the paraspeckle-mediated nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :630-645 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. 1 × 10 7 293FT cells or 3T3 cells expressing flag-β-TrcP or flag-β-TrcP truncations were used to immunoprecipitate with anti-Flag (Sigma) antibodies. After immunoprecipitation and wash, one-fourth beads were saved for WB.

For all h FAST truncated fragments, the same mole transcripts were used for protein binding assays. After washing 4 × 5 min with binding buffer, the bound RNAs were extracted and analyzed by denatured PAGE gels.
The Dig-labeled RNAs were annealed by heating at 65°C for 5 min, then slowly cooled down to room temperature. 10ng of Dig-labeled RNAs were used for each EMSA reaction. Protein-RNA binding was carried out with the indicated amount of purified protein and annealed Dig-labeled RNA in binding buffer [100 mM HEPES pH7.5, 200 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT (DL-Dithiothreitol)].

The gel was transferred to nylon membrane, and imaged by incubation with Anti-Digoxigenin-AP Solution.
RNA In Situ Hybridization was carried out as previously described with in vitro transcribed digoxin labeled antisense probes ( Yin et al., 2012 77. Yin, Q.F. ∙ Yang, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Long noncoding RNAs with snoRNA ends Mol. Cell. 2012; 48 :219-230 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, H9 and R1 cells were fixed with 3.6% PFA and 10% acetic acid for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Then cells were subjected to incubation with denatured probes in hybridization buffer (50% formamide in 2xSSC) at 50°C overnight. After hybridization, anti-Dig primary antibodies and fluorescent secondary antibodies were sequentially added to visualize signals with DeltaVision Elite imaging system (GE Healthcare). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.

Correction of a genetic disease in mouse via use of CRISPR-Cas9 Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13 :659-662 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two pairs of sgRNAs that specifically target the genomic loci of m Fast or h FAST were constructed followed by Multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 Assembly System Kit protocol. Transfection plasmids in R1 cells were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Thermo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA and total RNA of selected single clones were extracted either for the genotyping validation with appropriate sets of primer listed in Table S7 or for knockout efficiency validation by qRT-PCR.
A serial dilution of the linearized plasmid pcDNA3-h FAST was used for qRT-PCR to generate a standard curve to calculate h FAST absolute abundance. Copy number of the diluted plasmid pcDNA3-h FAST was calculated by the DNA/RNA Copy Number Calculator from website ( http://endmemo.com/bio/dnacopynum.php ). To measure the h FAST copy number in H9 cells, total RNA extracted from 1 × 10 6 cells was reverse transcribed into cDNAs for qPCR analysis, and the copy number of h FAST was quantitated from the standard curve.
2.5 × 10 3 scramble or EV and h FAST KD or KO H9 or CT1 cells were calculated by Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (Therm Fisher) and seeded on irradiated-MEF feeder cells with 10 μM Y-27632 (Tocris) at the first day, then cultured for 7 days by changing the culture medium daily. Survival colonies were stained by 0.1% Crystal Violet at room temperature for 2 minutes followed washing by DPBS twice. Pictures were taken and the average number of colonies per well were measured. The colony formation ability was presented by the ratio of survival colonies to the total seeded cells at the first day.
Alkaline phosphatase staining was carried out using Alkaline Phosphatase Detection Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. H9 colonies were seeded on the irradiated-MEF feeder cells or on Matrigel coated dishes, and then cultured for 5 days at 37°C. H9 cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 1 minute after wash twice with DPBS, and were then incubated with 1 x TBST [20mM Tris-Hcl (pH7.4), 0.15M Nacl, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.5% Triten X 100] for 5 minutes after wash off 4% PFA. The cells were incubated with Nalphthol/Fast Red Violet solution mix in dark for 15 minutes, followed by wash off the solution and add 1mL DPBS for pictures taken and further analysis.
In-cell SHAPE probing was performed in H9 cells as previously described ( Liu et al., 2019 41. Liu, C.X. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Nan, F. ... Structure and Degradation of Circular RNAs Regulate PKR Activation in Innate Immunity Cell. 2019; 177 :865-880.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Briefly, H9 cells were cultured on 10 cm dishes for two days to reach 1 × 10 6 cells. After washed with DPBS, H9 cells were incubated with 900 μL of cell culture medium and 100 μL of 10x SHAPE Chemical in DMSO with the final concentration of NAI (EMD Millipore) at 100 mM for 10 minutes at 37°C. After removed probing medium, RNAs were isolated by 1 mL Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The same procedure was also performed in parallel for the untreated control samples, but with the addition of only DMSO. In the denaturing control (DC) reaction, RNAs were suspended in a denaturing buffer containing 50% formamide and were incubated at 95°C before modification with SHAPE reagents.
Isolated RNAs were treated with DNase I (Ambion, DNA-freeTM kit) to remove possible DNA contamination. About 50-100 ng of RNAs were obtained under each treatment, and were then used for SHAPE-MaP reverse transcription by adding 1 μL (200 U/μL) of SuperScript II (Invitrogen), 6 mM Mn 2+ and gene-specific primers for h FAST . Mn 2+ was removed using G-25 micro-spin columns (GE Healthcare) after SHAPE-MaP reverse transcription. Second-strand synthesis was performed with Q5 hot start high-fidelity DNA polymerase and nested PCR was performed to further improve DNA yield. The resulting PCR products were further isolated with PureLink micr spin columns (Life Technologies). Primers for SHAPE-MaP reverse transcription and second-strand synthesis (1st round PCR and nested PCR reactions) were listed in Table S7 .
SHAPE-MaP libraries were prepared from 1 ng of DNAs, and size-selected with AmpureXP beads (Agencourt) with a 1:1 (bead to sample) ratio to obtain library DNA products spanning 100-400 bp in length. Final libraries were quantified using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and QuBit high-sensitivity dsDNA assay. Deep sequencing was performed by Illumina NextSeq 500 at CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology Omics Core, Shanghai, China. About 15-25 million mapped sequencing reads were obtained for each sample, with 88% of bases at or above Q30.
For RNA-seq samples from H9 and R1/E cells, total/cytoplasmic/nuclear RNAs were processed with the RiboMinus kit (Human/Mouse Module, Invitrogen) to deplete ribosomal RNAs for sequencing (Ribo– RNA-seq). For h FAST KD total RNA-seq samples, polyadenylated (poly(A) + ) RNA preparation was carried out as previously described ( Yang et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2015 73. Yang, L. ∙ Duff, M.O. ∙ Graveley, B.R. ... Genomewide characterization of non-polyadenylated RNAs Genome Biol. 2011; 12 :R16 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar 78. Yin, Q.F. ∙ Chen, L.L. ∙ Yang, L. Fractionation of non-polyadenylated and ribosomal-free RNAs from mammalian cells Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1206 :69-80 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total RNAs (8 μg) were incubated with oligo(dT) magnetic beads to isolate poly(A) + RNAs, which were bound to beads, and selection was performed three times to ensure the purity of poly(A) + RNA populations.
Ribo– and poly(A) + RNA-seq libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit. All libraries were size-selected with AmpureXP beads (Agencourt) and quantified using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and QuBit high-sensitivity dsDNA assay. Size-selected libraries were subjected to deep sequencing with Illumina HiSeq X ten at CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology Omics Core, Shanghai, China. Raw read qualities were evaluated by FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ) .
RNA-seq reads were first processed by using trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 4. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (38365) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 0.35, parameters: ILLUMINACLIP: TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:80) to remove low quality bases and adaptor sequences, and then mapped by using HISAT2 ( Kim et al., 2015 31. Kim, D. ∙ Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. HISAT: a fast spliced aligner with low memory requirements Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :357-360 Crossref Scopus (13773) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2.0.5, parameters:–no-softclip–score-min L,-16,0–mp 7,7–rfg 0,7–rdg 0,7–dta -k 1–max-seeds 20) to GRCh37/hg19 human reference genome with the GENCODE gene annotation (version 28lift27) or GRCm38/mm10 mouse reference genome with the GENCODE gene annotation (version M17) or Mmul_10/rheMac10 with Ensembl gene annotation (version 98). The HISAT2-mapped sam files were transferred to bam format by samtools ( Li et al., 2009 37. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The sequence alignment/map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38872) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 0.1.19). Gene expression levels were calculated with FPKM ( Trapnell et al., 2010 64. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (11853) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) by normalizing gene counts from featureCounts ( Liao et al., 2014 39. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (13451) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 1.5.1, parameters:–fraction -O -T 10 -t exon -g gene_id).
Raw images were processed with softWoRx 7.0 and ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 58. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40013) PubMed Google Scholar ). Deconvolution images were generated by softWoRx 7.0. Nuclear foci statistics were performed using the “JACoP” plugin for ImageJ/Fiji ( Bolte and Cordelières, 2006 5. Bolte, S. ∙ Cordelières, F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy J. Microsc. 2006; 224 :213-232 Crossref Scopus (3773) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefy, split RGB images into two separate channels containing DAPI (blue) and RNA signals (red) using “Split Channels.” Then, calculate the colocalization of DAPI and RNA signals using “JACoP” plugin with “M1 & M2 coefficients.” M2 is defined as the ratio of the ‘summed intensities of pixels from the red image for which the intensity in the blue channel is above zero’ to the ‘total intensity in the red channel’, refer to the percentage of nuclear foci of RNA signals.
Sequence-conserved lncRNAs were detected by two methods ( Figure S1 A). On the one hand, H9 expressed lncRNAs were mapped to mouse genome by the UCSC LiftOver tool (parameters: -bedPlus = 12 -tab -minMatch = 0.8 -minBlocks = 0.5 -multiple). Sequence-conserved lncRNA candidates were defined with ≥ 20% exon sequence conservation after the LifeOver alignment. On the other hand, sequences of paired lncRNAs expressed in H9 and R1 were compared by Blast ( Camacho et al., 2009 7. Camacho, C. ∙ Coulouris, G. ∙ Avagyan, V. ... BLAST+: architecture and applications BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :421 Crossref Scopus (12214) PubMed Google Scholar ) (parameters: -task blastn -word_size 6 -strand plus -outfmt 6). The sequence-conserved lncRNA candidates were defined with ≥ 20% sequence similarity between paired lncRNAs. Only overlapped lncRNAs identified in both methods were defined as sequence-conserved lncRNAs.
Positionally conserved lncRNAs between human and mouse were identified in the same subgroups (divergent, convergent or the same strand lncRNAs) with the distance between the lncRNA and its neighbor mRNA no longer than 5 kb, together with the same conserved adjacent protein coding genes and the conserved promoters. Promoters were defined as upstream and downstream 500 bps from transcription start site (TSS). TSSs were fetched from either gene annotations or CAGE datasets ( Fort et al., 2014 21. Fort, A. ∙ Hashimoto, K. ∙ Yamada, D. ..., FANTOM Consortium Deep transcriptome profiling of mammalian stem cells supports a regulatory role for retrotransposons in pluripotency maintenance Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :558-566 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conserved protein coding genes were fetched from NCBI HomoloGene database (version build68; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene ).
3,200 bps sequences upstream of human, rhesus monkey and mouse FOXD3 genes were extracted. Then EMBOSS Matcher ( Madeira et al., 2019 44. Madeira, F. ∙ Park, Y.M. ∙ Lee, J. ... The EMBL-EBI search and sequence analysis tools APIs in 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W636-W641 Crossref Scopus (3084) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to pairwisely compare these sequences. According to the comparison results from EMBOSS, conserved regions were extracted manually. Finally, conservation of FAST were evaluated in three aspects ( Ulitsky, 2016 65. Ulitsky, I. Evolution to the rescue: using comparative genomics to understand long non-coding RNAs Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :601-614 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ) including: 1) conserved exonic structure, 2) conserved sequence, and 3) positionally conserved transcription.
We applied a “Cytoplasmic Ratio” to indicate the subcellular localization pattern of each expressed RNA in a given cell type from related RNA-seq dataset. The RNA concentrations in the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fractions of a given cell type were experimentally measured after cell fractionation. A constant cytoplasmic factor was calculated by concentration cyto / (concentration cyto + concentration nuc ), and a constant nuclear factor was calculated by concentration nuc / (concentration cyto + concentration nuc ). Expression of cytoplasmic RNAs was normalized by multiplying FPKM cyto by the constant cytoplasmic factor in a given cell type, and expression of nuclear RNAs was normalized by multiplying FPKM nuc by the constant nuclear factor. Finally, the cytoplasmic ratio of an expressed RNA in a given cell type was defined as dividing normalized FPKM cyto by the sum of normalized FPKM cyto and normalized FPKM nuc .
All stem cell maintenance-related genes were fetched from AmiGO ( Carbon et al., 2009 8. Carbon, S. ∙ Ireland, A. ∙ Mungall, C.J. ..., AmiGO Hub, Web Presence Working Group AmiGO: online access to ontology and annotation data Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :288-289 Crossref Scopus (1351) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression levels of these genes in the scramble or h FAST knockdown H9 cells and additional hiPS and ES cells ( Choi et al., 2015 16. Choi, J. ∙ Lee, S. ∙ Mallard, W. ... A comparison of genetically matched cell lines reveals the equivalence of human iPSCs and ESCs Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :1173-1181 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ) were shown as heatmap by pheatmap package in R (version 3.4.1) from related RNA-seq samples.
Genes in six stem-related signaling pathways (WNT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, TGF-beta, JAK-STAT and Notch signaling pathway) were collected from KEGG database ( Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 30. Kanehisa, M. ∙ Goto, S. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 :27-30 Crossref Scopus (23411) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fold changes (FC) between the scramble and the h FAST knockdown RNA-seq samples were used to define upregulated (FC ≥ 1.5), unchanged (0.667 < FC < 1.5) or downregulated (FC ≤ 0.667) genes. Dys-regulated, either upregulated or downregulated, genes were identified after h FAST knockdown. Bubble plot, drawn by R (version 3.4.1), indicates dys-regulated genes in each individual stem-related signaling pathway after h FAST knockdown from related RNA-seq datasets.
SHAPE reactivity profiles were created from deep sequencing datasets for h FAST by using ShapeMapper (version 1.2) with default parameters ( Smola et al., 2015 61. Smola, M.J. ∙ Rice, G.M. ∙ Busan, S. ... Selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) for direct, versatile and accurate RNA structure analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :1643-1669 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, low quality score sequence reads were trimmed. Paired-end reads without overlapping sequences were analyzed as two single reads, while paired-end reads with overlapped sequences were merged into single reads. Pre-processed reads were then mapped to target sequences by Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 35. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33805) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2.1.0, parameters: -p 24 -L 15 -D 20 -R 3–local–sensitive-local–ma 2–mp 6,2–rdg 5,1–rfg 5,1–dpad 100–maxins 800–ignore-quals–no-unal). Mutation rate (MutR) of each position was calculated by dividing the total number of mismatches and indels (deletions and insertions) by the number of all mapped reads to the position. SHAPE reactivities of all positions were calculated by [(ModifiedMutR – UntreatedMutR)/DenaturedMutR] and normalized by a model-free box-plot approach ( Deigan et al., 2009 17. Deigan, K.E. ∙ Li, T.W. ∙ Mathews, D.H. ... Accurate SHAPE-directed RNA structure determination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :97-102 Crossref Scopus (529) PubMed Google Scholar ). More than 80% positions with at least 1000-read depth in three (modified, untreated and denatured) samples ( Mustoe et al., 2018 50. Mustoe, A.M. ∙ Busan, S. ∙ Rice, G.M. ... Pervasive Regulatory Functions of mRNA Structure Revealed by High-Resolution SHAPE Probing Cell. 2018; 173 :181-195.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used for the h FAST secondary structure modeling.
With SHAPE reactivity values determined by ShapeMapper, h FAST secondary structure was modeled by Superfold (version 1.0).
The ORFfinder ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/ ) webtool was used to predict possible ORFs of h FAST with default parameters.
The sequences of h FAST and m Fast were uploaded onto ATtRACT (A daTabase of RNA binding proteins and AssoCiated moTifs) database ( Giudice et al., 2016 23. Giudice, G. ∙ Sánchez-Cabo, F. ∙ Torroja, C. ... ATtRACT—a database of RNA-binding proteins and associated motifs Database. 2016; Published online April 7, 2016 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only RBPs with bound motifs longer than 5 nt were considered as candidate trans -factors that may impact FAST processing. Predicted RBPs that can bind both h FAST and m Fast were sorted according to their predicted binding sites and were used in the subsequent analyses.
Conservation between human PPIE protein and mouse Ppie protein were analyzed by UniProt Align web tool ( https://www.uniprot.org/align/ ) with default parameters, which is based on Clustal Omega.
After RNA-seq data processing, we get gene expression level (FPKM) from six ribo– sample: scramble cytoplasmic (FPKM scr_cyto ), scramble nuclear (FPKM scr_nuc ), scramble total cell (FPKM scr_total ), Ppie KD cytoplasmic (FPKM kd_cyto ), Ppie KD nuclear (FPKM kd_nuc ) and Ppie KD total cell (FPKM kd_total ) RNA-seq datasets. mRNAs and lncRNAs with FPKM scr_total ≥ 0.5 or FPKM kd_ total ≥ 0.5 are used in the downstream analysis. Fold changes (FC; FPKM kd_total /FPKM scr_total ) between the scramble and the Ppie knockdown RNA-seq samples were used to define upregulated (FC ≥ 2), unchanged (0.5 < FC < 2) or downregulated (FC ≤ 0.5) genes. Unchanged genes were selected for further different subcellular localization analysis. Next, expression levels of Gapdh in each sample were used to normalize expression levels in each sample, for example: before normalization, expression level of a gene x in scramble cytoplasmic sample is FPKM scr_cyto_x ; after normalization, expression level of the gene x is FPKM’ scr_cyto_x = FPKM scr_cyto_x /FPKM scr_cyto_Gapdh . After normalization to Gapdh , N/C is calculated as FPKM’ scr_nuc /FPKM’ scr_cyto to represent subcellular localization in the cells. Finally, localization changes (LC; (N/C kd )/(N/C scr )) between scramble and Ppie KD samples were defined export after KD (LC ≤ 0.5), unchanged (0.5 < LC < 2) or nuclear retention (LC ≥ 2) genes.
Statistical significance for comparisons was generally assessed by Student’s t test with exceptions described below. Statistical significance for stem-related signaling pathway analysis ( Figure 3 A) was assessed using Fisher’s Exact test with R (version 3.4.1). P value s below 0.05 were marked by one asterisk, while two asterisks indicate P value < 0.01 and three asterisks indicate P value < 0.001.
The accession number for ribo– RNA-seq samples from H9 and R1 cells, total/cytoplasmic/nuclear RNA and polyadenylated [poly(A) + ] RNA-seq samples from h FAST KD/scramble H9 cells is GEO: GSE143496 and NODE: OEP000734. All original unprocessed data related to this paper were uploaded to Mendeley Data in the website: https://dx.doi.org/10.17632/f4nkpt5h82.1 .
