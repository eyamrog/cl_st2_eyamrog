Title: Quick COVID-19 Healers Sustain Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Production


Abstract: Summary

Antibodies are key immune effectors that confer protection against pathogenic threats. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well defined. We charted longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 subjects after symptomatic COVID-19. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unimodally distributed over a broad range, with symptom severity correlating directly with virus-specific antibody magnitude. Seventy-six subjects followed longitudinally to ∼100 days demonstrated marked heterogeneity in antibody duration dynamics. Virus-specific IgG decayed substantially in most individuals, whereas a distinct subset had stable or increasing antibody levels in the same time frame despite similar initial antibody magnitudes. These individuals with increasing responses recovered rapidly from symptomatic COVID-19 disease, harbored increased somatic mutations in virus-specific memory B cell antibody genes, and had persistent higher frequencies of previously activated CD4 + T cells. These findings illuminate an efficient immune phenotype that connects symptom clearance speed to differential antibody durability dynamics.

Section: Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major global threat. COVID-19 shows remarkable heterogeneity spanning from asymptomatic to lethal infections ( Wu and McGoogan, 2020 42. Wu, Z. ∙ McGoogan, J.M. Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72314 Cases From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention JAMA. 2020; 323 :1239-1242 Crossref Scopus (12761) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 43.

A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14578) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2020 44. Zhu, N. ∙ Zhang, D. ∙ Wang, W. ..., China Novel Coronavirus Investigating and Research Team A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :727-733 Crossref Scopus (18833) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is a critical need to understand the nature of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 to shed light on requirements and likelihood for durable protective immunity in humans.
Antibodies are secreted effector molecules produced as dimers of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) and light (L) chain pairs from B lineage cells and come in various IgH isotypes (e.g., IgM, IgG, IgA). Antibody responses to initial infection can reduce the probability of getting sick from the same pathogen more than once. Upon a first-time infection, the antibody system can learn to better recognize the pathogen through a process of B cell clonal selection and somatic hypermutation (SHM) and then produce these improved versions of antibodies in greater amounts to prophylax for a future encounter by the pathogen.
After primary infection or vaccination, IgG antibody production can be maintained and protect for decades as is the case for diphtheria, varicella-zoster, and measles ( Amanna et al., 2007 1. Amanna, I.J. ∙ Carlson, N.E. ∙ Slifka, M.K. Duration of humoral immunity to common viral and vaccine antigens N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 :1903-1915 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ). Durable antibody responses like these rely on coordinated T and B lymphocyte interactions within lymphoid tissue germinal centers (GCs). Activated B cells within GCs diversify Ig genes through SHM—producing Ig variants, which then compete for limiting T follicular helper (T FH ) cell survival through coordinated and organized cellular interactions ( Cyster and Allen, 2019 8.

Mesin, L. ∙ Ersching, J. ∙ Victora, G.D. Germinal Center B Cell Dynamics Immunity. 2016; 45 :471-482 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). This competition matures the affinity of the antibodies produced by the B cells and facilitates differentiation of these GC-experienced B cells into long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and memory B cells, necessary cell types for sustained antibody production and efficient cellular recall responses ( Balaz et al., 2019 2. Balaz, M. ∙ Becker, A.S. ∙ Balazova, L. ...

Weisel, F. ∙ Shlomchik, M. Memory B Cells of Mice and Humans Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35 :255-284 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). Memory B cells can more efficiently differentiate into antibody secreting plasma cells upon subsequent pathogen invasion, but pre-formed pathogen-specific antibodies produced from LLPCs represent an additional layer of immune function that can protect from initial invasion. B cells that are activated outside of GCs can also differentiate into memory B cells ( Takemori et al., 2014 37. Takemori, T. ∙ Kaji, T. ∙ Takahashi, Y. ... Generation of memory B cells inside and outside germinal centers Eur. J. Immunol. 2014; 44 :1258-1264 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ) in addition to shorter-lived versions of antibody-secreting cells such as plasmablasts and short-lived plasma cells (SLPCs).
COVID-19-recovered subjects produce IgGs targeting viral nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike, which is of particular relevance for their high likelihood of neutralizing capacity ( Premkumar et al., 2020 30.

Immunol. 2020; 5 :eabc8413 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these antibodies are low magnitude in the majority of mild SARS-CoV-2 infections, with higher levels produced in more severe disease ( Long et al., 2020a 20.

While S-reactive antibodies from convalescent patients can potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, they largely lack evidence of SHM ( Ju et al., 2020 17. Ju, B. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Ge, J. ... Human neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection Nature. 2020; 584 :115-119 Crossref Scopus (1174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robbiani et al., 2020 32.

Isolation of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and protection from disease in a small animal model Science. 2020; 369 :956-963 Crossref Scopus (891) PubMed Google Scholar ). The low SHM in SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory B cells and weak responses hint at low utilization of the GC process, consistent with reports of primarily extrafollicular (i.e., outside GC) immune responses ( Woodruff et al., 2020 41. Woodruff, M.C. ∙ Ramonell, R.P. ∙ Nguyen, D.C. ... Extrafollicular B cell responses correlate with neutralizing antibodies and morbidity in COVID-19 Nat Immunol. 2020; Crossref Scopus (449) PubMed Google Scholar ) and dysregulated GC responses ( Kaneko et al., 2020 18. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.H. ∙ Boucau, J. ... Loss of Bcl-6-Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and Germinal Centers in COVID-19 Cell. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) in subjects with severe COVID-19. In this light, whether natural SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to sustained antibody responses, and what may influence these responses are critical questions.
To address this, we conducted a longitudinal study of COVID-19 convalescent subjects. We quantified plasma IgG and IgM, as well as the stability of plasma IgG to multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens among subjects with mostly mild disease over time. We found that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were broadly distributed and correlated with symptom severity. While a majority displayed IgG decay, a distinct subset showed sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels over the same time frame. This distinct subset showed shorter symptom duration, increased SHM in SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive memory B cell antibody genes shortly after symptom resolution, and an increase in frequencies of previously activated CD4 + T cells. These findings suggest a distinct immunophenotype connecting symptomatic disease resolution kinetics and antibody durability dynamics for SARS-CoV-2.

Section: Results

We recruited subjects that recovered from COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 in the Boston, MA area. Each case was diagnosed based on symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and confirmatory laboratory testing (91 PCR test-confirmed and 1 antibody test-confirmed COVID-19) ( Table S1 ). Five individuals were hospitalized, while all others recovered at home with mostly mild disease. The 1 st blood sample was collected following primary symptom resolution followed by repeated collections at monthly intervals. Plasma and peripheral blood cells were isolated from each blood sample for analysis.
Quantitative ELISA measurement of plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM to N, S, and RBD revealed a 3-order magnitude range of virus-specific IgG ( Figure 1 A). Five of the 92 subjects showed no greater IgG pre-pandemic era controls, consistent with previously reported positivity rates in mild cases ( Harritshoej et al., 2020 12.

Differences in antibody kinetics and functionality between severe and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections J. Infect. Dis. 2020; 222 :1265-1269 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, most subjects displayed levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM close to pre-COVID-19 era control plasma levels ( Figure 1 B). Spearman rank-order analysis found significant correlations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG magnitude between both age and self-reported symptom severity, with r values between 0.31 and 0.41 ( Figure 1 C) with no correlations between initial virus-specific IgG level and body mass index (BMI) or symptom duration ( Figure 1 C). Scatterplots for age and severity with antibody magnitude illustrate that these features trend together ( Figures 1 D–1I). All additional correlation scatterplots and an illustration of the range of symptom severity scores are given in Figure S1 . The direct and highly significant correlation of self-reported symptom severity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG magnitude supports the value of self-reported severity as a fair metric between individuals within this cohort as this is an established correlation ( Long et al., 2020a 20. Long, Q.X. ∙ Liu, B.Z. ∙ Deng, H.J. ... Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :845-848 Crossref Scopus (2078) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robbiani et al., 2020 32.

We also performed Luminex assays to measure reactivity of specific antibody isotypes (including IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and IgA) to SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as antibody interactions with Fc receptors (FcRs) ( Figure 2 ). We compared anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels between pre-pandemic negative control samples and the first 60 recruited subjects from the COVID-19 convalescent cohort ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The Luminex assay confirmed ELISA-based IgG observations and was superior to ELISA at differentiating the low anti-S IgM levels between controls and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals ( Figure 2 B). We observed that 10%–15% of subjects were negative for anti-N, anti-S, and anti-RBD IgG1, consistent with ELISA data ( Figure 2 C). IgM measurements showed that 20%–49% of COVID-19-recovered subjects could not be distinguished from negative controls by the time of the 1 st blood draw ( Figure 2 D). Strong correlations between anti-N and anti-S or anti-N and anti-RBD IgG1 levels ( Figures 2 E and 2F) suggest that some individuals may recover from COVID-19 without measurable antibodies. It is possible these individuals had a false-positive PCR test, but the criteria for the presence of symptoms plus the positive test make false positives less likely.
We used a machine learning latent variable modeling approach to discern covariation features most importantly associated with severity. We separated individuals into low (1–4) or high (5–10) severity groups and performed orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), in which measurement variance contributing to discrimination between these two categories is accounted for in one latent variable comprising a weighted combination of critical features selected by regularization from the Luminex and ELISA data ( Figure 2 G). The result suggests that anti-S1 IgG1, anti-RBD IgG titer, anti-N IgG2, and IgG3 measures are most importantly correlative of high symptom severity ( Figure 2 H). This model is 65% accurate at predicting symptom severity based on an area under the curve of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis ( Figure 2 I). Correlation network analysis ( Figure 2 J) illustrates the additional antibody features that covary with the four key features, representing the most germane immune system processes more broadly. The Luminex assay also included influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and S RBDs from three cold-causing coronaviruses. Antibodies to these antigens generally did not predict COVID-19 disease outcomes ( Figure S2 ), although IgG to human coronavirus 229E did associate with COVID-19 symptom severity.
We explored antibody decay dynamics by quantifying anti-N, anti-S, and anti-RBD IgG for repeated plasma isolations ( Figure 3 ). Seventy-six subjects donated 2 nd and 3 rd monthly samples (median 39, range 13–88) such that draw 3 was ∼100 days following disease onset (median 109, range 83–173) ( Figure 3 A). Virus-specific IgG decline occurred in most individuals. We quantified this decline by calculating the quotient of the 3 rd draw IgG level divided by the 1 st draw IgG level for each antigen and deemed this the “antibody durability index” ( Figure 3 B). Anti-N IgG declined in 88%, anti-S in 72%, and anti-RBD in 74% of the convalescent subjects by their 3 rd blood draw. The median antibody durability index values were 0.49, 0.65, and 0.61 for anti-N, anti-S, and anti-RBD IgG, respectively. These findings are consistent with a decaying IgG response in the majority of COVID-19 convalescent subjects.
While the majority of convalescent subjects showed decline, some individuals showed stable or enhanced antibody production over the same time period. We examined this by grouping subjects based on their ∼100-day (i.e., draw 3-defined) antibody durability indices into “sustainer” (durability index ≥ 1) and “decayer” (durability index < 1) categories. We noted that most individuals qualifying as IgG sustainers with respect to one antigen also sustained production of IgG specific to the other antigens ( Figure 3 C; Table S2 ). Plotting quantitative ( Figure 3 D) as well as draw 1-normalized ( Figure 3 E) antibody levels over the first three blood draws showed the trend of stable/increasing antibody levels in sustainers and decreasing antibody levels in decayers. Plotting the same data as days post symptom onset demonstrated a similar diversity of timing of blood draws between the groups ( Figures S3 A and S3B). In addition, sustainers and decayers do not differ substantially in timing of blood draws, either with respect to symptom onset or symptom resolution ( Figures S3 C–S3F).
Of the 76 individuals who completed three longitudinal blood draws, 72 seroconverted. For these 72 individuals, we explored associations between subject and disease characteristics and sustained antibody production ( Figure 3 F) using Spearman correlation analysis. Both anti-S and anti-RBD IgG durability indices significantly correlated inversely with disease symptom duration, with r values of −0.28 and −0.27, respectively. The anti-N IgG durability index showed no significant relationship with symptom duration, suggesting a unique effect of the anti-S and anti-RBD antibodies. Full scatterplots for the correlation between anti-S ( Figure 3 G) and anti-RBD ( Figure 3 H) durability indices and COVID-19 symptom duration illustrate the association between a shorter disease course and more durable antibody responses. Anti-S IgG durability also correlated inversely with symptom severity (r = −0.27). No significant correlations were found between age or BMI and antibody durability ( Figures 3 F and S4 A–S4S).
Direct comparison of symptom duration showed that anti-S IgG sustainers had significantly shorter symptom duration (median 9.5, range 2–34) than anti-S IgG decayers (median 15.5, range 1–49) ( Figures 3 I and 3K). Anti-RBD IgG sustainers also had significantly shorter symptom duration (median 10, range 2–17) compared to anti-RBD IgG decayers (median 16, range 1–49). Similar analyses for age, BMI, and symptom severity did not reveal significant differences ( Figures S4 T and S4U). Anti-S IgG and anti-RBD IgG sustainers had draw 1 anti-S IgG and anti-RBD IgG spanning the range of levels observed for the entire cohort ( Figures 3 D and S4 V). In addition, direct comparisons of initial antibody levels among sustainers and decayers showed no significant differences ( Figures 3 J and 3L), and we saw no significant relationship between initial IgG level to N, S, or RBD and disease symptom duration ( Figure 1 C). Despite similar initial blood draw levels, sustainers showed a trend toward greater anti-S IgG ( Figure 3 J) and significantly more anti-RBD IgG ( Figure 3 L) compared to decayers in draw 3, consistent with the notion that a unique feature of sustainers is anti-virus IgG maintenance in contrast to initial magnitude. Together, these data indicate that relatively sustained antibody production occurs within individuals with a diverse range of initial IgG magnitude and shortened disease course.
While it is unknown what level of measurable functional antibody activity correlates with protection, we explored potential functional consequences of differences in antibody decay dynamics between draw 1 and 3 ( Figure S5 ). A major mechanism of antibody neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is inhibition of binding of S to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 13. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor Cell. 2020; 181 :271-280.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13640) PubMed Google Scholar ). ACE2-binding inhibition assays showed that while initial inhibition activity was lower for sustainers than decayers, they became indistinguishable by draw 3 ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Relatedly, sustainers had higher ACE2-inhbition durability indices ( Figures S5 A and S5B), indicating that overall stability of antibody responses correlated with more stable functional activity. We also measured stability of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity using an automated high-throughput pseudovirus neutralization assay as well as conventional pseudovirus neutralization assays ( Figure S5 C). Neutralization titer positively correlated with age and disease severity, similar to overall antibody levels ( Figure S5 D). In contrast to ELISA antibody measurements and ACE2 inhibition levels, 50% neutralization titers (NT 50 ) were tightly clustered among all subjects in the 1 st and 3 rd samples with no evidence of differences in magnitude or durability dynamics between sustainers and decayers at these time points ( Figures S5 F–S5I). The constrained ability to distinguish subjects based on differences in NT 50 levels over time was likely due to the small range of values approaching limit of detection, in contrast to other antibody measures ( Figure S5 E). In this regard, substantial NT 50 decline between draw 1 and draw 3 was observed only within individuals with high initial neutralization titers ( Figure S5 C).
To further explore features of the swift-healing antibody-sustainer phenotype, we characterized CD4 + ( Figure 4 ) and CD8 + ( Figure S6 ) T cell populations using a previously established T cell phenotyping strategy ( Mathew et al., 2020 24. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ..., UPenn COVID Processing Unit Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 :eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that sustainers had a higher frequency of memory (CD45RA − ) CD4 + T cells in both 1 st draw and in their 3 rd draw several months later. No significant differences in CD8 + T cell populations were observed. These data suggest that those that heal quickly from mild COVID-19 harbor differences in CD4 + T cell subsets that persist well past disease resolution.
We also fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted S-specific single memory B cells and sequenced their Ig genes to assess SHM. We confirmed that S-specific memory cells were not plasmablasts based on CD20 and CD38 expression ( Figures S7 A–S7C). We selected 12 sustainers and 13 decayers based on similar initial antibody levels ( Figures S7 J and S7K). Clinical and antibody features of these subjects showed they are representative of each group ( Figures S7 D–S7Q), and they had similar frequencies of S-specific memory cells ( Figures 5 A and 5B). We observed significantly higher IgH V gene segment (V H ) mutations in the sustainer clones isolated from the 1 st blood draw ( Figure 5 C). We found that 19.4% of draw 1 sustainer clones had greater than 15 mutations (top 10 th percentile) in contrast to 4.2% of decayer clones ( Figure 5 D). We also found that sustainer-derived clones with less than 15 mutations also had significantly higher draw 1 mutation frequency ( Figure S7 R). The difference in mutation frequency between sustainers and decayers collapsed by the time of the 3 rd blood draw ( Figures 5 C and 5D) as both groups gained significantly more mutations by draw 3. Light chain V gene (V L ) mutation largely paralleled the V H results ( Figures 5 E and 5F). No differences in V H gene segment usage were observed between the groups ( Figure 6 G). These data suggest that increased virus-specific memory B cell SHM early after recovery may be a unique sustainer feature and that continued evolution of anti-SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells occurs more globally later on in convalescence.
Sixty-eight subjects returned for a 4 th blood draw, of which 64 showed SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion ( Figure 6 ). The 4 th draw samples allowed us to test whether (1) antibodies remain durable in sustainers and (2) whether this durability translates to greater antibody levels at ∼145 post symptom onset ( Figure 6 A). For this analysis, we continued to divide subjects based on their antibody durability index calculated for blood draw 3 (i.e., draw 3-defined sustainers and decayers) ( Figure 6 B) and measured overall antibody levels, ACE2 binding inhibition, and pseudovirus neutralization for the 4 th draw blood samples ( Figures 6 C and 6D). For these draw 3-defined groups, we calculated draw 4 durability indices by dividing a subject’s 4 th draw value by their 1 st draw measure. After a relatively short period of ∼1 month between draws 3 and 4, absolute magnitudes of anti-S and anti-RBD IgG had become significantly greater for sustainers compared to decayers. The total antibody durability indices were also significantly higher for sustainers compared to decayers. Additionally, anti-S IgG sustainers had significantly greater neutralizing antibody at this time point ( Figure 6 C) and anti-S and anti-RBD sustainers showed significantly higher ACE2 binding inhibition durability indices in draw 4.
We reanalyzed our cohort by grouping subjects as sustainers or decayers based on ratios of draw 4 IgG levels to those in draw 1 (i.e., draw 4-defined sustainers and decayers) to compare to draw 3-defined groups ( Figure 7 A). We found considerable overlap in draw 3- and draw 4-defined sustainers ( Figure 7 B). The key clinical correlation—reduced symptom duration in sustainers—was also observed for draw 4-defined sustainers ( Figures 7 C and 7D). We also observed similar differences in total antibody levels and neutralization and durability indices for draw 4-defined sustainers ( Figures 7 E and 7F) as we did for draw 3-defined sustainers ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Together, these data strengthen the conclusion that sustained production of virus-specific IgG is associated with short disease duration. The data also indicate that despite a large range of initial antibody levels, IgG sustainers end up having greater antibody magnitudes compared to decayers as a whole.

Section: Discussion

The data presented here show that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mild disease are broadly distributed following infection and declined substantially in most individuals over time. However, some individuals sustained antibody levels over the same time frame. These IgG sustainers had shorter disease courses despite similar distribution of initial anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, and their anti-S memory B cells harbored increased levels of SHM shortly after disease resolution. Heterogeneity of sustained and declining antibody titers has been documented in common cold coronaviruses. A small study showed that some individuals after virus challenge produced near peak levels of anti-coronavirus IgG 50 weeks out from virus challenge, while others declined near background signal levels between 10 and 20 weeks ( Callow et al., 1990 6. Callow, K.A. ∙ Parry, H.F. ∙ Sergeant, M. ... The time course of the immune response to experimental coronavirus infection of man Epidemiol. Infect. 1990; 105 :435-446 Crossref Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar ). A lack of sustained immunity to seasonal coronaviruses has also been shown epidemiologically ( Edridge et al., 2020 9. Edridge, A.W.D. ∙ Kaczorowska, J. ∙ Hoste, A.C.R. ... Seasonal coronavirus protective immunity is short-lasting Nat. Med. 2020; Crossref Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kiyuka et al., 2018 19.

Dis. 2018; 217 :1728-1739 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). While antibody durability is known to be influenced by virus type ( Amanna et al., 2007 1. Amanna, I.J. ∙ Carlson, N.E. ∙ Slifka, M.K. Duration of humoral immunity to common viral and vaccine antigens N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 :1903-1915 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as host and environmental factors ( Hagan et al., 2019 11. Hagan, T. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Rouphael, N. ... Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans Cell. 2019; 178 :1313-1328.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ), why certain individuals produce longer-lived antibody responses while others do not is not fully understood.
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody decline toward baseline as seen in many individuals is consistent with a dominant role for short-lived plasmablasts and/or SLPCs as a transient antibody source. This, paired with low disease-proximal memory B cell SHM in most individuals, is consistent with dominant extrafollicular antibody responses in IgG decayers ( Woodruff et al., 2020 41. Woodruff, M.C. ∙ Ramonell, R.P. ∙ Nguyen, D.C. ... Extrafollicular B cell responses correlate with neutralizing antibodies and morbidity in COVID-19 Nat Immunol. 2020; Crossref Scopus (449) PubMed Google Scholar ) perhaps due to impaired GCs as seen in individuals with more severe disease ( Kaneko et al., 2020 18. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.H. ∙ Boucau, J. ... Loss of Bcl-6-Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and Germinal Centers in COVID-19 Cell. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Why SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with predominantly extrafollicular antibody responses and dysregulated GCs remains to be fully elucidated. It is possible that the same pro-inflammatory mediators contributed by innate and adaptive immune cells that drive severe disease in some cases ( Lucas et al., 2020 22. Lucas, C. ∙ Wong, P. ∙ Klein, J. ... Longitudinal analyses reveal immunological misfiring in severe COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 584 :463-469 Crossref Scopus (1406) PubMed Google Scholar ) are the same that dysregulate the GC processes as has been shown in severe malaria ( Ryg-Cornejo et al., 2016 34. Ryg-Cornejo, V. ∙ Ioannidis, L.J. ∙ Ly, A. ... Severe Malaria Infections Impair Germinal Center Responses by Inhibiting T Follicular Helper Cell Differentiation Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :68-81 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ) and intracellular bacterial infections ( Popescu et al., 2019 29. Popescu, M. ∙ Cabrera-Martinez, B. ∙ Winslow, G.M. TNF-α Contributes to Lymphoid Tissue Disorganization and Germinal Center B Cell Suppression during Intracellular Bacterial Infection J. Immunol. 2019; 203 :2415-2424 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). A similar process could underly GC inhibition in severe COVID-19 ( Kaneko et al., 2020 18. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.H. ∙ Boucau, J. ... Loss of Bcl-6-Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and Germinal Centers in COVID-19 Cell. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may underlie declining antibody levels due to largely extrafollicular B cell activation and/or suboptimal GC responses in most individuals with mild COVID-19 as well.
Low SHM antibodies can be potent neutralizers ( Ju et al., 2020 17. Ju, B. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Ge, J. ... Human neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection Nature. 2020; 584 :115-119 Crossref Scopus (1174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robbiani et al., 2020 32. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rogers et al., 2020 33. Rogers, T.F. ∙ Zhao, F. ∙ Huang, D. ... Isolation of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and protection from disease in a small animal model Science. 2020; 369 :956-963 Crossref Scopus (891) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the human pre-immune antibody repertoire is not deficient in specificities to neutralizing targets on SARS-CoV-2 spike ( Brouwer et al., 2020 4. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses are therefore not constrained by gaps in the repertoire but may be limited by poor mobilization of B cells into the LLPC compartment to produce high titer sustained responses as can be seen in other infections ( Amanna et al., 2007 1. Amanna, I.J. ∙ Carlson, N.E. ∙ Slifka, M.K. Duration of humoral immunity to common viral and vaccine antigens N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 :1903-1915 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with potential suppression of optimal GC responses and LLPC differentiation in COVID-19. Notably, SHM levels among sustainer and decayer memory B cells continue to accumulate SHM several months following resolution of infection consistent with recent work showing increased plasma avidity to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals over time ( Piccoli et al., 2020 28. Piccoli, L. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Mapping Neutralizing and Immunodominant Sites on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain by Structure-Guided High-Resolution Serology Cell. 2020; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (882) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antigen from pathogens can be retained for many months by follicular dendritic cells in secondary lymphoid tissues allowing affinity maturation to proceed in the absence of an active infection. It is possible that a return to a normal inflammatory milieu after resolution of COVID-19 restores GCs that may have been suppressed only during active disease, and selection on retained viral antigen facilitates late accumulation of SHM in decayers. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is that memory B cells that lack SHM may be counter-selected over time independent of continued GC output ( Takahashi et al., 1998 36. Takahashi, Y. ∙ Dutta, P.R. ∙ Cerasoli, D.M. ... In situ studies of the primary immune response to (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl. V. Affinity maturation develops in two stages of clonal selection J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187 :885-895 Crossref Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ).
An important implication of our data is the possible existence of an efficient SARS-CoV-2 virus “handler” phenotype, defined as individuals who experience swift COVID-19 resolution associated with relatively sustained anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG production. Based on the requirement of GCs for LLPCs and SHM accumulation, this suggests that the sustainer phenotype may include relatively more optimal coordination of lymphocyte interactions in physiologic GC responses. In this regard, GC dysregulation and short-lived antibody responses may not be inevitable outcomes of COVID-19. Elevated percentages of CD4 + effector memory T cells in those that heal quickly and sustain antibody production adds support to a distinct immunophenotype connected to more rapid resolution of disease. Whether the increased percentage of effector memory T cells in sustainers is a reflection of increased disposition to CD4 + effector memory differentiation, an indicator of past experience, or whether it is related to COVID-19 sequelae in sustainers remains to be uncovered.
The degree to which the efficient healer phenotype is due to intrinsic host differences or prior immune priming also warrants further investigation. Sustainers could represent a subset of individuals with pre-existing memory lymphocytes from a seasonal coronavirus infection that happens to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Reactivation of cross-reactive memory cells could prime GC reactions for more optimal function and a recall response may help explain the limited disease duration of sustainers. It is also possible that stimulation of pre-existing memory B cells in this context may be more prone to generate LLPCs. This scenario would also be consistent with the observation of higher early SHM levels in sustainers compared to decayers. Arguing against a priming model is that analysis of other human coronaviruses did not show correlations with COVID-19 symptom duration. However, because timing of potential priming events may matter, and antibodies to common human coronaviruses may not be sustained, analysis beyond antibody levels will be required to further address this.
As discussed above, increased SHM does not appear to be required for potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization function. In this light, we think it unlikely that the elevated early SHM in sustainers had a direct causal role in quicker symptom clearance, although we have not ruled this out. Instead, we propose that elevated SHM and durable antibody production in sustainers are sequalae of a superior wholistic immune process that overall was responsible for swifter healing. As a part of the immune process in sustainers, we posit that reduced suppression of optimal GC responses occurred during the original infection resulting in superior LLPC differentiation. Why sustainers heal more quickly and whether this is related to why they were able to sustain virus-specific IgG production, potentially by shielding GCs from infection-mediated dysregulation/suppression, remain to be determined. Understanding the specific drivers of diminished versus enhanced antibody durability in cohorts such as this may provide insights into correlates of protection to SARS-CoV-2 and may elucidate targetable pathways to enhance efficient clearance and more sustained antibody-mediated protection.
While population diversity was our aim, most volunteers for this study were adults, female, and Caucasian. While we have confidence in the biologic conclusions, it will be important for future studies to understand the nature of antibody responses in children and adults from a diversity of backgrounds and races. In addition, while the mild and moderate cases represented a large portion of SARS-CoV-2 symptomatology ( Oran and Topol, 2020 27. Oran, D.P. ∙ Topol, E.J. Prevalence of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Narrative Review Ann Intern Med. 2020; Crossref Scopus (1374) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu and McGoogan, 2020 42. Wu, Z. ∙ McGoogan, J.M. Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72314 Cases From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention JAMA. 2020; 323 :1239-1242 Crossref Scopus (12761) PubMed Google Scholar ), severe and asymptomatic cases are not represented here. In this context, our work may also provide a framework to address whether the features of increased SHM coupled with quicker symptom resolution and relatively sustained anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are seen in severe and asymptomatic cases and whether this extends to seasonal coronavirus biology. Whether continued virus replication plays a role in driving sustained responses also remains to be determined, but we feel this is less likely as it does not easily explain the quick healing correlate. In addition, future work will be enhanced by including sample collection before and during COVID-19 allowing direct insights into pre-immune correlates of the sustainer and decayer phenotypes.

This study and protocol were approved by the Partners Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through advertisements including flyers posted in Boston area hospitals and online through an institutional website for clinical studies open to the public. 26 male and 66 female volunteers aged 18 and older with a history of COVID-19 were enrolled between March and June 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a healthcare professional based on symptoms and a positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR test. Positive RT-PCR tests were verified by study staff. After enrollment, the clinical team determined one subject was diagnosed not by PCR test but by Quest Diagnostics antibody test and symptomatology consistent with COVID-19. Blood samples were obtained from March 2020-June 2020 via antecubital venipuncture. Participants completed questionnaires regarding demographic information, medical history, and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Participants self-reported any personal history of lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunocompromise (either due to a medical condition or medication use) and symptoms and characteristics of their COVID-19 clinical course. Participants rated the severity of their COVID-19 symptoms on a 1-10 scale, with 1 describing very mild symptoms and 10 describing very severe symptoms. Participants self-reported the symptom onset date, and the symptom recovery date. Of the 92 participants who donated a first blood sample, 5 participants with a long-term mild symptom component donated their first blood sample before their reported final symptom resolution date. All others were collected following completion of full symptom resolution. Symptom duration is calculated by subtracting the symptom recovery date and the symptom onset date. Detailed demographic and other information describing the cohort are provided in Table S1 . BMI indicates body mass index. It was calculated by the participant’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters.
96-well polystyrene plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with 30 μL of 0.6 μg/mL N protein (Genscript), 0.3 μg/mL S (gift of Bing Chen, Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard) or 0.6 μg/mL RBD (gift of Aaron Schmidt, Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard) diluted in bicarbonate buffer (0.1M) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Coat solutions were discarded and 100 μL of 3% BSA in PBS added to each well to block. Blocking was performed for > 2 h at room temperature. During the block step, plasma was thawed at room temperature, combined with an equal volume of 2% Triton in PBS (Thermo Fisher) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature to inactivate enveloped viruses. Dilutions of plasma and standards were made using 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS as diluent. Block solution was discarded and plates washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. Plasma dilutions were then applied to the plates and they were placed at 4°C overnight. Following the plasma incubation step, plates were washed three times with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. Secondary antibody solutions of anti-human IgG-alkaline phosphatase (AP) diluted 1:2000 in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 or anti-human IgM-AP at a 1:1000 dilution in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) were prepared and 30 μL distributed to each well. Secondary antibodies were incubated on the plates for 90 min at room temperature and then three washes performed. Alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate tablets (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in 0.1 M glycine, pH 10.4, with 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM ZnCl 2 , pH 10.4 to a concentration of 1.6 mg/mL and 100 μL of this development solution distributed to each well. Plates were placed in the dark and allowed to develop for 2 h prior to reading. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Biotek Synergy H1). All samples were run in duplicate wells.
For quantitation of plasma IgG or IgM reactive to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a 2x dilution series was produced from an initial 100x plasma dilution for each sample. A 2x dilution series of either a pooled COVID-19 convalescent plasma or RBD-binding monoclonal IgG1, CR3022, were included on each plate as controls. A standard curve was produced by non-linear regression with Graphpad software from the control values. The Ig level for each unknown sample was determined by interpolation for a single dilution with an OD405 405nm falling in the mid-range of the standards. Where a polyclonal standard was used, antibody levels are reported in reference to the standard as arbitrary units (AU). Where CR3022 was used a standard, antibody levels are reported as CR3022 concentration equivalents (mAb μg/mL equivalents).
Pre-COVID19 plasma from four healthy subjects were included as negative controls on each ELISA plate. These pre-COVID19 plasma were collected before 10/01/2019.
A custom multiplexed Luminex assay was used to measure relative titer of antigen-specific subclasses, isotypes and Fc-receptors (FcRs), as previously described ( Brown et al., 2012 5. Brown, E.P. ∙ Licht, A.F. ∙ Dugast, A.S. ... High-throughput, multiplexed IgG subclassing of antigen-specific antibodies from clinical samples J. Immunol. Methods. 2012; 386 :117-123 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, antigen was covalently coupled to carboxyl-beads using EDC (Thermo Fisher) and Sulfo-NHS (Thermo Fisher). Antigen used in the Luminex assay include SARS-CoV-2 RBD, OC43 RBD, NL63 RBD, 229E RBD, NL63 RBD (all kindly provided by Aaron Schmidt, Ragon Institute), SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Aalto Bio Reagents), SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal domain (NTD) (kindly provided by Moderna, Inc.) and SARS-CoV-2 S (kindly provided by Eric Fischer, Dana Farber) as well as S1 (Sino Biological) and S2 (Sino Biological) subunits of S. Antigen-coupled beads were blocked, washed with PBS-Tween, resuspended in PBS and stored at 4°C. Plasma was diluted (1:500 for IgG1, 1:1000 for all Fc- receptors, and 1:100 for all other isotype/subclass readouts). Immune complexes were formed by overnight incubation of diluted plasma and antigen-coupled beads at 4°C, shaking at 700 rpm. The following day, plates were washed with an automated plate washer (Tecan) with 0.1% BSA 0.02% Tween-20. Antigen-specific antibody titers were detected with PE-coupled secondaries (Southern Biotech). For FcR-binding, FcRs with an AviTag (Duke Protein Production Facility) were biotinylated with BirA500 kit (Avidity). For detection of FcR binding, FcRs were labeled with PE before addition to the immune complex. Fluorescence was detected using an Intellicyt iQue and analyzed using Forecyt software.
Prior to multi-variate analysis, each Luminex and ELISA-derived feature was box-cox transformed, centered and scaled to unit variance. OPLS-DA was performed on a feature set reduced via elastic net regularization and variable selection. Elastic net minimizes the number of features needed in the model without forfeiting model performance ( Zou and Haste, 2005 45. Zou, H. ∙ Haste, T. Regularization and variable selection via the elastic net J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 2005; 67 :301-320 Crossref Scopus (11884) Google Scholar ). All ElasticNet parameters were optimized using a tuneLength = 10 and leave-one-out cross validation. The final reduced feature set included variables selected in 80% or more of 100 rounds of the elastic net algorithm. The R ‘ropls’ package was used to implement OPLS-DA (orthI = 1; PredI = 1). An AUC-ROC curve was generated to evaluate the performance of the model using the python ‘sklearn.metrics’ package. Pairwise spearman’s correlation tests were performed comparing each feature in the dataset to the four features included in the final OPLS-DA model. Correlations with coefficients greater than 0.75 and p < 0.1 were inputted into Cytoscape to generate correlation networks. To divide symptoms scores into low and high, we chose 1-4 for low, and 5-10 for high due to the fact that the distribution was bimodal with one peak at 3 and the other at 5, so 4 is a natural dividing point.
PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll (GE Lifesciences) separation from blood. B cells were enriched from total PBMCs using anti-CD19-conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyi). Flow-through cells were used to analyze T cell populations. Following enrichment, B cells were incubated with 2 μg/mL flag-tagged S protein (Genscript) on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed and incubated with both APC and PE conjugated anti-Flag antibodies to double stain S-binding B cells. Surface-marker targeting stains were simultaneously applied with the anti-flag antibodies. DAPI - IgM - IgD - IgG + CD27 + Spike + cells were single sorted in 96 well plates containing 4 μL/well of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5x PBS containing 10mM DTT, and 4 U RNaseout). Plates were sealed with AlumaSeal 96 film (Sigma), and immediately frozen on dry ice before transfer to a −80°C freezer. The RT-PCR and sequencing of Ig transcripts was performed as described ( Tiller et al., 2008 38. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, single cell RNA was reverse transcribed with 200 ng random hexamer primer (Thermo Fisher), 1 μL 10mM of dNTP (Promega), 0.7 μL 100 mM DTT, 0.1 μL RNaseout, 0.5% v/v Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), and 50 U superscript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher). The reverse transcription reaction was performed in a thermocycler using the following program: 42°C for 10 min, 25°C for 10min, and 50°C for 60 min. Subsequently, 2 μL of cDNA was used to amplified Ig sequences by separate heavy, κ light chain and λ light chain-targeting nested PCRs. Each reaction was performed in a 20 μL volume containing 250 nM primer mix, 250 nM dNTP mix (Promega) and 0.5 U HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (QIAGEN). Two rounds of amplification were performed for 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 58°C (IgH/Igκ) or 60°C (Igλ) for 30 s, 72°C for 55 s (1st PCR) or 45 s (2nd PCR). The PCR products from the second PCR were sent for Sanger sequencing with reverse primers. The sequences were trimmed based on quality score provided by the service provider (GENEWIZ) and aligned by IgBlastn v.1.16.0 with IMGT annotated germline sequences. To determine somatic hypermutations, productive and in-frame IGHV nucleotide sequences were aligned to their closest germline sequences ( Robbiani et al., 2020 32. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 by plasma was measured using a commercial kit supplied by Genscript as described by the manufacturer. In brief, RBD conjugated to HRP was incubated with dilutions of plasma from 1:5, 1:10, 1:30, 1:90, 1:270, to 1:810 in supplied dilution buffer for 30 min at 37°C. 100 μL of plasma and RBD-HRP solutions were then applied to a microtiter plate coated with recombinant ACE2 and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The plates were then washed 4 times with the supplied wash solution and 100 μL of TMB applied to each well. Plates were then incubated in the dark at 25°C for 15 min and development quenched using 50 μL of stop solution. Absorbance at 450 nm was then read using a microplate reader (Biotek Synergy H1). Positive and negative controls were provided with the kit. Percent of inhibition was calculated by (1 –OD value of sample/average OD value of negative controls) x 100%. Non-linear regression was performed using Graphpad Prism software to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) titer. IC 50 values derived from curves with goodness of fit less than 0.7 or IC 50 values less than 1 in initial and follow up blood draws were excluded from further analysis.
Neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was measured using a single-round infection assay in 293T/ACE2/TMPRSS2 target cells. Pseudotyped virus particles were produced in HEK293T cells (ATCC) by co-transfection of three plasmids: pHDM-SARS2-Spike-delta21, pLenti CMV Puro LUC (w168-1), and psPAX2 (Addgene). The HEK293T cell line stably overexpressing the human ACE2 cell surface receptor protein and TMPRSS2 was kindly provided by Dr. Marc Johnson (University of Missouri School of Medicine). For neutralization assays, serial dilutions of patient plasma samples were performed in duplicate followed by addition of pseudovirus. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C followed by addition to target cells (2x10 4 /well). Wells containing cells and pseudovirus (without sample) or cells alone acted as positive and negative infection controls, respectively. Assays were harvested on day 2 using Promega One-Glo luciferase reagent and luminescence detected with a Biotek Synergy H1. Titers are reported as the plasma dilution that inhibited 50% of infection (NT 50 ), which was determined by non-linear regression using Graphpad Prism. Samples with NT 50 derived from curves with goodness of fit less than 0.7 were excluded due to technical error unless the lowest dilution (i.e., 1:30) returned values less than 50% neutralization, in which case the NT 50 were included as the detection limit (i.e, 30). Subjects with NT 50 values no more than 30 (the detectable limit) were excluded from durability index calculations.
Lentiviral vector-based pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed as previously described ( Crawford et al., 2020 7. Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Eguia, R. ∙ Dingens, A.S. ... Protocol and Reagents for Pseudotyping Lentiviral Particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein for Neutralization Assays Viruses. 2020; 12 :513 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with a combination of pHAGE2-CMV-Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen-W transfer vector and four separate helper plasmids encoding HIV-GagPol, Rev, Tat and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Pseudovirus was collected and frozen for subsequent neutralization assays. Neutralization assays were performed by mixing the indicated dilution of plasma with pseudovirus for 1 h, prior to the addition of ACE2-expressing 293T target cells (a gift of Michael Farzan). After incubation at 37C with 5% CO 2 for 60 h, luciferase signal was measured using a SpectraMAX L instrument. Non-linear regression was performed using Graphpad Prism software to determine NT 50 . NT 50 values derived from curves with goodness of fit less than 0.7 were excluded from further analysis.
GraphPad Prism 8 software was used for all data analyses excluding multivariate analysis, which is described in detail above. Lognormality of antibody titration data was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk test and Student’s t test was used for comparisons of log-transformed antibody levels. Single comparisons between other metrics were performed using Mann-Whitney U test and multiple comparisons were performed using Kruskal-Wallis test. For single variate correlation analyses involving continuous and categorical data, Spearman correlation analysis was performed. Measured p values are presented with relevant datasets or described in the text.
