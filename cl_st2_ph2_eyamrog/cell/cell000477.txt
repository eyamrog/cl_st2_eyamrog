Title: In vivo CRISPR screens identify the E3 ligase Cop1 as a modulator of macrophage infiltration and cancer immunotherapy target


Abstract: Summary

Despite remarkable clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer treatment, ICB benefits for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain limited. Through pooled in vivo CRISPR knockout (KO) screens in syngeneic TNBC mouse models, we found that deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cop1 in cancer cells decreases secretion of macrophage-associated chemokines, reduces tumor macrophage infiltration, enhances anti-tumor immunity, and strengthens ICB response. Transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics analyses revealed that Cop1 functions through proteasomal degradation of the C/ebpδ protein. The Cop1 substrate Trib2 functions as a scaffold linking Cop1 and C/ebpδ , which leads to polyubiquitination of C/ebpδ . In addition, deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cop1 in cancer cells stabilizes C/ebpδ to suppress expression of macrophage chemoattractant genes. Our integrated approach implicates Cop1 as a target for improving cancer immunotherapy efficacy in TNBC by regulating chemokine secretion and macrophage infiltration in the tumor microenvironment.

Section: Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality in the United States ( Fallahpour et al., 2017 26. Fallahpour, S. ∙ Navaneelan, T. ∙ De, P. ... Breast cancer survival by molecular subtype: a population-based analysis of cancer registry data CMAJ Open. 2017; 5 :E734-E739 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Waks and Winer, 2019 114. Waks, A.G. ∙ Winer, E.P. Breast Cancer Treatment JAMA. 2019; 321 :316 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes 15% of breast cancer cases and has the worst prognosis among the molecular subtypes, motivating research efforts to find new treatment options ( Bianchini et al., 2016 7. Bianchini, G. ∙ Balko, J.M. ∙ Mayer, I.A. ... Triple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous disease Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2016; 13 :674-690 Crossref Scopus (1049) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown remarkable clinical benefits for individuals with skin, lung, and colorectal cancer ( Halle et al., 2017 38. Halle, S. ∙ Halle, O. ∙ Förster, R. Mechanisms and Dynamics of T Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity In Vivo Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :432-443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising the possibility of effective ICB treatment of breast cancer. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first ICB therapy for treatment of metastatic TNBC. Atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, was approved in combination with nab-paclitaxel (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) based on prolonged progression-free survival ( Schmid et al., 2018 102. Schmid, P. ∙ Adams, S. ∙ Rugo, H.S. ..., IMpassion130 Trial Investigators Atezolizumab and Nab-Paclitaxel in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 379 :2108-2121 Crossref Scopus (1653) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although this advance demonstrates the promise of ICB in breast cancer treatment, the benefits were limited to a small subset of individuals. A recent clinical trial reported that pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, had an objective response rate of just 18% in PD-L1-expressing advanced TNBC ( Nanda et al., 2016 79. Nanda, R. ∙ Chow, L.Q.M. ∙ Dees, E.C. ... Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Phase Ib KEYNOTE-012 Study J. Clin. Oncol. 2016; 34 :2460-2467 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This underscores the need for finding new immune targets to enhance ICB response and improve outcomes in TNBC.
The immune system is known to play important roles in cancer progression ( Coussens et al., 2013 14. Coussens, L.M. ∙ Zitvogel, L. ∙ Palucka, A.K. Neutralizing tumor-promoting chronic inflammation: a magic bullet? Science. 2013; 339 :286-291 Crossref Scopus (709) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011 39. Hanahan, D. ∙ Weinberg, R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation Cell. 2011; 144 :646-674 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37088) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the molecular mechanisms regulating tumor immunity and the tumor microenvironment (TME) are not fully understood. Some cell types in the TME are proposed to promote tumor growth and metastasis, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) ( Grivennikov et al., 2010 34. Grivennikov, S.I. ∙ Greten, F.R. ∙ Karin, M. Immunity, inflammation, and cancer Cell. 2010; 140 :883-899 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6575) PubMed Google Scholar ), fibroblasts ( Landskron et al., 2014 50. Landskron, G. ∙ De la Fuente, M. ∙ Thuwajit, P. ... Chronic inflammation and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment J. Immunol. Res. 2014; 2014 :149185 Crossref Scopus (935) PubMed Google Scholar ), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) ( Su et al., 2018 107. Su, S. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yao, H. ... CD10 + GPR77 + Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer Stemness Cell. 2018; 172 :841-856.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among them, TAMs are major players and are thought to promote angiogenesis, cancer cell local invasion, and intravasation at primary tumor sites. At metastatic sites, TAMs can also facilitate cancer cell extravasation and block CD8 + T cell recruitment and functions ( Cassetta and Pollard, 2018 9. Cassetta, L. ∙ Pollard, J.W. Targeting macrophages: therapeutic approaches in cancer Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2018; 17 :887-904 Crossref Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peranzoni et al., 2018 90.

USA. 2018; 115 :E4041-E4050 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). In affected individuals, macrophage infiltration in tumors is strongly associated with poor clinical outcome in numerous cancer types, including breast cancer ( Cassetta et al., 2019 10. Cassetta, L. ∙ Fragkogianni, S. ∙ Sims, A.H. ...

Zhang, J. ∙ Yan, Y. ∙ Yang, Y. ... High Infiltration of Tumor-Associated Macrophages Influences Poor Prognosis in Human Gastric Cancer Patients, Associates With the Phenomenon of EMT Medicine (Baltimore). 2016; 95 :e2636 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In syngeneic mouse models, classical monocytes (mouse CD11b + Ly6C + ) are recruited to tumors and differentiate into TAMs as tumors progress ( Ginhoux and Jung, 2014 32. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Jung, S. Monocytes and macrophages: developmental pathways and tissue homeostasis Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :392-404 Crossref Scopus (986) PubMed Google Scholar ). This process often depends on macrophage chemoattractants secreted from cancer cells or activated macrophages, such as CCL2 ( Nielsen and Schmid, 2017 83. Nielsen, S.R. ∙ Schmid, M.C. Macrophages as Key Drivers of Cancer Progression and Metastasis Mediators Inflamm. 2017; 2017 :9624760 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), CCL4 ( Li et al., 2018 59.

Cancer. 2018; 9 :775-784 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), CCL5 ( Walens et al., 2019 115. Walens, A. ∙ DiMarco, A.V. ∙ Lupo, R. ... CCL5 promotes breast cancer recurrence through macrophage recruitment in residual tumors eLife. 2019; 8 :e43653 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), CXCL1 ( Wang et al., 2017 116. Wang, D. ∙ Sun, H. ∙ Wei, J. ... CXCL1 Is Critical for Premetastatic Niche Formation and Metastasis in Colorectal Cancer Cancer Res. 2017; 77 :3655-3665 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ), and CXCL5 ( Zhao et al., 2017 130. Zhao, J. ∙ Ou, B. ∙ Han, D. ... Tumor-derived CXCL5 promotes human colorectal cancer metastasis through activation of the ERK/Elk-1/Snail and AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin pathways Mol. Cancer. 2017; 16 :70 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, a monoclonal antibody was developed to inhibit the CCL2 signaling pathway, which indeed attenuates TAM infiltration, suppresses tumor growth, and improves survival ( Qian et al., 2011 91. Qian, B.-Z. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Zhang, H. ... CCL2 recruits inflammatory monocytes to facilitate breast-tumour metastasis Nature. 2011; 475 :222-225 Crossref Scopus (1596) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, pharmacological inhibition of chemokines is associated with chemokine overexpression because of homeostatic feedback, yielding adverse effects ( Lim et al., 2016 62. Lim, S.Y. ∙ Yuzhalin, A.E. ∙ Gordon-Weeks, A.N. ... Targeting the CCL2-CCR2 signaling axis in cancer metastasis Oncotarget. 2016; 7 :28697-28710 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings motivated us to discover novel targets to reprogram the TME for cancer treatment.
Functional genomic screening using CRISPR-Cas9 has shown promise as a robust and unbiased approach to discover novel cancer targets. It has also been adopted to find novel modulators of tumor immunity, discover novel immuno-oncology targets, and dissect their mechanisms. For instance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based genome-wide CRISPR screens in vitro have discovered multiple regulators of PD-L1 and/or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, which potentially facilitate combination immunotherapies for cancer ( Burr et al., 2017 8.

CRISPR screens in cancer cells co-cultured with T cells identified Pbrm1 loss as increasing the sensitivity of B16F10 melanoma cells to effector T cells ( Pan et al., 2018 87. Pan, D. ∙ Kobayashi, A. ∙ Jiang, P. ... A major chromatin regulator determines resistance of tumor cells to T cell-mediated killing Science. 2018; 359 :770-775 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). A separate screen in cancer cells co-cultured with T cells identified genes that, when knocked out in cancer cells, induce immune escape ( Lawson et al., 2020 52. Lawson, K.A. ∙ Sousa, C.M. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Functional genomic landscape of cancer-intrinsic evasion of killing by T cells Nature. 2020; 586 :120-126 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pooled in vivo CRISPR screens in murine melanoma models revealed that loss of Ptpn2 ( Manguso et al., 2017 65. Manguso, R.T. ∙ Pope, H.W. ∙ Zimmer, M.D. ... In vivo CRISPR screening identifies Ptpn2 as a cancer immunotherapy target Nature. 2017; 547 :413-418 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Adar1 ( Ishizuka et al., 2019 40. Ishizuka, J.J. ∙ Manguso, R.T. ∙ Cheruiyot, C.K. ... Loss of ADAR1 in tumours overcomes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade Nature. 2019; 565 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ) could enhance tumor sensitivity to immunotherapy. Although in vivo CRISPR screens effectively query broad aspects of tumor immunity, only a few hundred genes at a time can be screened. This has limited their application to a restricted set of tumor models. This encouraged us to test more genes in different syngeneic models using in vivo CRISPR screens with the intention of identifying new regulators of tumor immunity.
In this study, we constructed custom murine CRISPR knockout libraries and used them to conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in murine TNBC and colon cancer models under different levels of host immunity. Through two rounds of in vivo screens, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cop1 as an important regulator of tumor-infiltrating M2 macrophages and anti-PD-1 response in vivo . To further characterize the function and mechanisms of Cop1 in cancer cells, we performed detailed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and proteomics analyses to identify Cop1 ’s substrate. Deletion of Cop1 in TNBC cells led to increased C/ebpδ protein stability and chromatin binding, which suppresses expression of key macrophage chemoattractants and cytokines involved in macrophage chemotaxis and activation. Detailed analysis of the substrates that were altered significantly upon Cop1 depletion revealed that Cop1 targets C/ebpδ for proteasome degradation via the scaffolding protein Trib2. Observations of clinical tumor immune infiltration and survival of affected individuals across many cancer types strongly support the clinical relevance of Cop1 as a tumor-immune modulator of C/ebpδ -regulated macrophage infiltration. More generally, our study demonstrates the power of systems biology approaches in identifying modulators of macrophage infiltration and cancer immunotherapy targets.

Section: Results

To systematically discover gene targets in cancer cells whose loss enhances anti-tumor immunity, we first constructed a murine lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (MusCK) library. This library includes 5 sgRNAs for each of over 4,500 genes implicated in tumor initiation, progression, and immune modulation ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ; see STAR Methods for further details). To validate the quality of the MusCK library, we transduced it into the mouse TNBC cell line 4T1 in vitro ( Figure S1 B; see STAR Methods for further details). 4T1 cells closely resemble human TNBC cells ( Figures S1 C and S1D), are transplantable into syngeneic BALB/c background mice, and have been used extensively in tumor immunology studies ( Kim et al., 2014 48. Kim, K. ∙ Skora, A.D. ∙ Li, Z. ... Eradication of metastatic mouse cancers resistant to immune checkpoint blockade by suppression of myeloid-derived cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11774-11779 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sagiv-Barfi et al., 2015 99. Sagiv-Barfi, I. ∙ Kohrt, H.E.K. ∙ Czerwinski, D.K. ... Therapeutic antitumor immunity by checkpoint blockade is enhanced by ibrutinib, an inhibitor of both BTK and ITK Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E966-E972 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). We compared sgRNA abundance distributions in freshly infected 4T1 cells with those in 4T1 cells cultured 10 passages after infection. Supporting the reliability of the MusCK library, cells harboring sgRNAs targeting known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were significantly depleted and enriched, respectively ( Figures S1 E and S1F; Table S2 ).
With the MusCK library validated, we next conducted in vivo CRISPR screens in 4T1 cells in syngeneic BALB/c mice. To this end, we first artificially expressed membrane-bound ovalbumin (mOva) in 4T1 cells, an approach used widely to enhance cellular immune responses in syngeneic tumor models. As expected, 4T1 tumors overexpressing mOva had increased lymphocyte infiltration and slower tumor growth ( Figures S1 G–S1J; see STAR Methods for further details). We then transduced the lentiviral MusCK library into mOva-expressing 4T1 cells and implanted infected cells into the mammary fat pads of BALB/c Foxn1 nu/nu hosts (nude), immune competent BALB/c hosts, and BALB/c hosts vaccinated with ovalbumin prior to transplantation ( Figure 1 A; Figures S1 K and S1L). We used 12 mice per arm and injected enough cells per mouse to achieve ∼200-fold coverage for all sgRNAs in the MusCK library. Sixteen days after transplantation, we harvested the engrafted cancer cells for analysis and observed significantly different tumor growth in different hosts. T cell-deficient BALB/c Foxn1 nu/nu hosts had the biggest tumors, and immune-competent hosts pre-vaccinated with ovalbumin had the smallest tumors ( Figure 1 B; Figure S1 M).
To analyze the CRISPR screen results, we examined the sgRNA abundance distribution in the resulting 4T1 tumors grown in vivo . Reflective of different selection pressure in the hosts, principal-component analysis showed that CRISPR screen samples separated first by in vitro versus in vivo conditions and then by nude mice versus immunocompetent mice ( Figure 1 C). Samples from the same condition cluster together, indicating similar library representations in biological replicates ( Figure 1 C). Inspection of the sgRNAs depleted from tumors in wild-type immunocompetent hosts compared with nude immunodeficient mice revealed key genes promoting immune evasion in 4T1 cancer cells ( Figure 1 D; Table S3 ; see STAR Methods for further details). As positive controls, sgRNAs targeting Cd274 ( Pd-l1 ) were depleted in tumors engrafted in wild-type mice, consistent with the known function of Cd274 in immune suppression ( Dong et al., 1999 20. Dong, H. ∙ Zhu, G. ∙ Tamada, K. ... B7-H1, a third member of the B7 family, co-stimulates T-cell proliferation and interleukin-10 secretion Nat. Med. 1999; 5 :1365-1369 Crossref Scopus (1706) PubMed Google Scholar ; Freeman et al., 2000 29. Freeman, G.J. ∙ Long, A.J. ∙ Iwai, Y. ... Engagement of the PD-1 immunoinhibitory receptor by a novel B7 family member leads to negative regulation of lymphocyte activation J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192 :1027-1034 Crossref Scopus (3396) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, key components of DNA repair pathways, such as Brca2 and Pms2 , were significantly negatively selected in wild-type mice ( Figure 1 D). This is also consistent with previous reports that cancer cells with greater genome instability or mutation burden were at risk of elimination by T cell-mediated killing ( Mandal et al., 2019 64. Mandal, R. ∙ Samstein, R.M. ∙ Lee, K.-W. ... Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response Science. 2019; 364 :485-491 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pearlman et al., 2017 89. Pearlman, R. ∙ Frankel, W.L. ∙ Swanson, B. ..., Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative Study Group Prevalence and Spectrum of Germline Cancer Susceptibility Gene Mutations Among Patients With Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer JAMA Oncol. 2017; 3 :464-471 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, key components of the interferon γ (IFNγ) pathway ( Jak1 , Jak2 , Stat1 , and Irf1 ) were significantly depleted in wild-type mice but not nude mice ( Figure 1 D), suggesting that defects in the IFNγ pathway in cancer cells could suppress immune evasion. IFNγ is a cytokine secreted by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to elicit an anti-tumor immune response ( Alshaker and Matalka, 2011 1. Alshaker, H.A. ∙ Matalka, K.Z. IFN-γ, IL-17 and TGF-β involvement in shaping the tumor microenvironment: The significance of modulating such cytokines in treating malignant solid tumors Cancer Cell Int. 2011; 11 :33 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). This result is contrary to previously reported findings from CRISPR-mediated genetic knockout (KO) screens in the murine B16F10 melanoma model ( Manguso et al., 2017 65. Manguso, R.T. ∙ Pope, H.W. ∙ Zimmer, M.D. ... In vivo CRISPR screening identifies Ptpn2 as a cancer immunotherapy target Nature. 2017; 547 :413-418 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ) but consistent with the role of IFNγ in promoting tumor immune evasion in multiple cancer types ( Beatty and Paterson, 2000 3. Beatty, G.L. ∙ Paterson, Y. IFN-gamma can promote tumor evasion of the immune system in vivo by down-regulating cellular levels of an endogenous tumor antigen J. Immunol. 2000; 165 :5502-5508 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Benci et al., 2016 5. Benci, J.L. ∙ Xu, B. ∙ Qiu, Y. ... Tumor Interferon Signaling Regulates a Multigenic Resistance Program to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2016; 167 :1540-1554.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 6. Benci, J.L. ∙ Johnson, L.R. ∙ Choa, R. ... Opposing Functions of Interferon Coordinate Adaptive and Innate Immune Responses to Cancer Immune Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2019; 178 :933-948.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). There have been reports that the duration of IFNγ signaling contributes to differential tumor responses to ICB, which may explain this apparent discrepancy ( Minn, 2015 74. Minn, A.J. Interferons and the Immunogenic Effects of Cancer Therapy Trends Immunol. 2015; 36 :725-737 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). RNA-seq analysis revealed that IFNγ signaling was active in 4T1 tumors in vivo but not in 4T1 cells in vitro ( Figure S1 N). Thus, it is possible that prolonged IFNγ signaling in tumors has an immunosuppressive function, which would explain why KO of IFNγ pathway genes enhances immune-mediated killing of TNBC cells.
To confirm our findings, we conducted a competition assay to assess the in vivo growth of 4T1 TNBC cells deficient in IFNγ signaling ( Figure S1 O). Western blotting confirmed the protein abundance of Jak1 or Stat1 KO in TNBC cells ( Figure S1 P). Then we mixed cancer cells (1:1 ratio, mCherry:EGFP) with Jak1 (or Stat1 ) KO and control Rosa26 KO cells (see STAR Methods for further details) and implanted the cell mixture into nude and wild-type mice. Flow cytometry analysis of the resulting tumors showed that the relative proportion of Jak1 or Stat1 KO cancer cells became consistently and significantly lower than those of control cells ( Figures 1 E and 1F), especially in wild-type mice. The same result was observed in another TNBC syngeneic model, EMT6 ( Figures 1 E and 1F), which not only supports the reliability of in vivo screens using our MusCK library but also confirms the role of IFNγ signaling in suppressing an anti-tumor immune response in TNBC.
Achieving adequate statistical significance for discovery in large-scale CRISPR screens requires behavioral consistency of multiple sgRNAs, each with sufficient cell coverage, for each target gene, especially under negative selection. To improve the robustness of our in vivo CRISPR screens, we constructed a second library (MusCK 2.0) focused on 79 candidate genes identified in the primary screen, with 8 sgRNAs per gene (see STAR Methods for further details). We then conducted a validation screen using the MusCK 2.0 library in 4T1-mOva cells implanted into (1) BALB/c Foxn1 nu/nu nude hosts, (2) wild-type BALB/c hosts, (3) wild-type BALB/c hosts with ovalbumin pre-vaccination, and (4) wild-type BALB/c hosts with ovalbumin pre-vaccination and monoclonal anti-PD-1 treatment ( Figure S2 A). The fourth group facilitates discovery of factors that affect antigen-specific T cell immunity through the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. As expected, we observed statistically significant and progressively lower tumor volumes in groups 1–4 16 days after cancer cell implantation ( Figure 2 A; Figures S2 A–S2C). We also observed progressively higher T cell infiltration (detected by TCRβ + ) relative to the total tumor immune infiltrates (marked by Cd45.2 + ) ( Figure 2 B; Figures S2 D–S2F) in these four groups. In wild-type BALB/c hosts (groups 2–4) relative to Foxn1 nu/nu hosts, one would expect depletion of genes required for an effective immune response. Indeed, we observed significant depletion of known mediators of immune evasion ( Cd274/Pd-l1 ) and components of the IFNγ signaling pathway ( Jak1 , Jak2 , Stat1 , and Irf1) . We also observed depletion of an oncogenic transcriptional activator identified previously by our laboratory in prostate cancer ( Trim24) ( Groner et al., 2016 35. Groner, A.C. ∙ Cato, L. ∙ de Tribolet-Hardy, J. ... TRIM24 Is an Oncogenic Transcriptional Activator in Prostate Cancer Cancer Cell. 2016; 29 :846-858 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ), an E3 ubiquitin ligase ( Cop1 ), and others ( Figure 2 C; Table S4 ). The phenotypes of these genes in 4T1 tumors were also observed in a second murine TNBC model (EMT6) ( Figures S2 G–S2J) and a murine colorectal cancer model (MC38) ( Figures S3 A–S3D), validating the robustness of our findings.
After two rounds of in vivo screens, Cop1 emerged as the most significantly depleted gene in 4T1 tumors from immunocompetent mice relative to nude mice ( Figures S3 E and S3F). Although Cop1 KO cells did not decrease viability compared with control Rosa26 KO cells in vitro ( Figure 2 D; Figure S3 G), we observed significantly slower tumor progression of Cop1 KO TNBC cells in vivo in wild-type BALB/c hosts with and without anti-PD-1 treatment ( Figure 2 E; Figure S3 H). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that wild-type mice with Cop1 -deficient tumors had prolonged survival with or without anti-PD-1 treatment compared with nude mice ( Figure 2 F). In the MC38 colorectal cancer model of immunocompetent C57BL/6 hosts, Cop1 KO in cells was also able to significantly decrease tumor growth and extend mouse survival ( Figures S3 I–S3K). Remarkably, in MC38 cells, Cop1 KO together with anti-PD-1 treatment in vivo was able to eradicate tumor growth and increase survival to 100% 60 days after tumor implantation ( Figure S3 K). The effect of Cop1 KO in the MC38 colorectal cancer syngeneic model suggests that Cop1 inhibition enhances anti-tumor immunity through a mechanism that may be applicable to other cancer types beyond TNBC.
Cop1 was originally discovered in Arabidopsis to induce targeted protein degradation ( Osterlund et al., 2000 86. Osterlund, M.T. ∙ Hardtke, C.S. ∙ Wei, N. ... Targeted destabilization of HY5 during light-regulated development of Arabidopsis Nature. 2000; 405 :462-466 Crossref Scopus (898) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple substrates of Cop1- mediated protein degradation in mammals with cancer implications have been identified, including the classic tumor suppressor Tp53 ( Dornan et al., 2004a 21. Dornan, D. ∙ Wertz, I. ∙ Shimizu, H. ... The ubiquitin ligase COP1 is a critical negative regulator of p53 Nature. 2004; 429 :86-92 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ), the transcriptional regulator c-Jun ( Savio et al., 2008 101.

Human De-etiolated-1 regulates c-Jun by assembling a CUL4A ubiquitin ligase Science. 2004; 303 :1371-1374 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the metabolic regulator Torc2 ( Dentin et al., 2007 16. Dentin, R. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Koo, S.-H. ... Insulin modulates gluconeogenesis by inhibition of the coactivator TORC2 Nature. 2007; 449 :366-369 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). In humans, COP1 is located in a region of chromosome 1 frequently amplified in individuals with breast cancer ( Figure S4 A) ( Dornan et al., 2004b 22. Dornan, D. ∙ Bheddah, S. ∙ Newton, K. ... COP1, the negative regulator of p53, is overexpressed in breast and ovarian adenocarcinomas Cancer Res. 2004; 64 :7226-7230 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). To characterize the effects of Cop1 on anti-tumor immunity, we first performed RNA-seq analysis of Cop1 KO and control Rosa26 KO in 4T1 cells under IFNγ treatment ( Figure 3 A). Differential expression analysis showed that 754 genes were significantly upregulated and 1,303 downregulated (q < 0.05) upon Cop1 KO ( Figure 3 B). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment of downregulated genes in immune-related pathways, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling, inflammatory responses, JAK-STAT signaling pathways, and chemokine and cytokine signaling activities ( Figure 3 C). We also observed similar results in 4T1 cells without IFNγ stimulation ( Figures S4 B–S4D).
One intriguing result was that Cop1 KO in 4T1 cells, with or without IFNγ stimulation, resulted in significant downregulation of key macrophage chemoattractants, cytokines involved in macrophage activation, and members of the TNF receptor superfamily ( Figure 3 D; Figure S4 E). Quantification of protein expression based on a cytokine array containing 96 cytokines confirmed significantly decreased levels of cytokines and chemokines known to recruit and activate macrophages, such as Ccl2 , Ccl5 , Ccl11 , Ccl19 , Ccl20 , Cxcl4 , Cxcl11 , Gm-csf , and Il-6 ( Figure 3 E; Figures S4 F and S4G). Consistent with a decrease in cytokines and chemokines, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry found a significant decrease in macrophage infiltration in Cop1 KO tumors ( Figures 3 F and 3G; Figures S4 H and S4I). In contrast, no significant change was observed in the level of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells, myeloid cells, and monocytes ( Figures S4 J–S4L). Furthermore, we confirmed the effect of Cop1 KO in decreasing macrophage chemoattractants in tumors grown in vivo using the same 96-cytokine array and bulk tumor RNA-seq ( Figure S4 M and S4N).
To evaluate which macrophage subsets were altered, we performed single-cell transcriptomics (single-cell RNA-seq [scRNA-seq]) on triplicate tumors with Rosa26 gRNAs and Cop1 gRNAs. Analysis of scRNA-seq of CD45 + immune cells from these KO tumors further revealed decreased M2 macrophage and increased M1 macrophage infiltration upon Cop1 KO ( Figures 3 H–3J). Furthermore, in the 4T1 model, macrophage percentage in tumor-infiltrating Cd45 + leukocytes was correlated positively with tumor size, whereas T cell percentage was correlated negatively ( Figures S4 O and S4P). Our results suggest that Cop1 in TNBC regulates macrophage chemotaxis in the TME. Inhibition of Cop1 decreases tumor macrophage infiltration, which, in turn, inhibits tumor progression and improves survival.
We next sought to identify the putative protein substrates of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cop1 . Because most of the known Cop1 substrates are transcription factors (TFs) ( Dornan et al., 2004a 21. Dornan, D. ∙ Wertz, I. ∙ Shimizu, H. ...

Invest. 2011; 121 :1329-1343 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vitari et al., 2011 112. Vitari, A.C. ∙ Leong, K.G. ∙ Newton, K. ... COP1 is a tumour suppressor that causes degradation of ETS transcription factors Nature. 2011; 474 :403-406 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reasoned that Cop1 KO might stabilize TFs that suppress expression of macrophage cytokines. To infer the likely TFs underlying the genes that are differentially expressed upon Cop1 KO, we used a computational method we developed previously called LISA ( Qin et al., 2020 93. Qin, Q. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Zheng, R. ... Lisa: inferring transcriptional regulators through integrative modeling of public chromatin accessibility and ChIP-seq data Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :32 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given a list of differentially expressed genes, LISA first estimates the epigenetic model fitting these input genes from a large compendium of publicly available histone mark and chromatin accessibility profiles in the Cistrome database and then uses TF chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) results and known DNA-binding motifs to infer the driving regulators ( Mei et al., 2017 67. Mei, S. ∙ Qin, Q. ∙ Wu, Q. ... Cistrome Data Browser: a data portal for ChIP-Seq and chromatin accessibility data in human and mouse Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D658-D662 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2019 131. Zheng, R. ∙ Wan, C. ∙ Mei, S. ... Cistrome Data Browser: expanded datasets and new tools for gene regulatory analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D729-D735 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ). LISA analysis of the genes downregulated upon Cop1 KO implicated the CEBP and AP-1 families of TFs as putative regulators ( Figure 4 A). Although a function in transcriptional repression has not yet been reported for the CEBP family, the AP-1 family is known to repress gene transcription ( Eferl and Wagner, 2003 24. Eferl, R. ∙ Wagner, E.F. AP-1: a double-edged sword in tumorigenesis Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3 :859-868 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Miao and Ding, 2003 72. Miao, Z.-H. ∙ Ding, J. Transcription factor c-Jun activation represses mdr-1 gene expression Cancer Res. 2003; 63 :4527-4532 PubMed Google Scholar ).
In parallel, we hypothesized that the TF substrates stabilized upon Cop1 KO would, in turn, increase chromatin binding and the accessibility at these binding sites. We therefore performed ATAC-seq on Cop1 KO 4T1 cells and control Rosa26 KO 4T1 cells. Regardless of IFNγ treatment, Cop1 KO did not change chromatin accessibility in the vast majority of the peaks ( Figure 4 B; Figure S5 A), although there were more upregulated ATAC-seq peaks. An analysis of motif enrichment and peak overlap with public ChIP-seq data found Cop1 KO-specific upregulated peaks to be enriched for binding by the AP-1 , CEBP , and ETS families of TFs ( Figure 4 C; Figure S5 B; Table S5 ). Therefore, the ATAC-seq data support RNA-seq analysis in implicating the AP-1 and CEBP families of TFs as putative substrates of Cop1 in 4T1 cells.
To further validate the substrates of Cop1 protein degradation, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteins with increased abundance in Cop1 KO 4T1 cells compared with control cells ( Figures S5 C and S5D; Table S6 ). Among the over 7,000 detected proteins, several members of the ETS , AP-1 , and CEBP TF families were significantly upregulated (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1), including the known Cop1 substrates c-Jun , Ets1 , Ets2 , and Etv4 ( Figure 4 D; Figure S5 E). To rule out the possibility of non-proteasomal degradation from secondary effects, we conducted additional proteomics analyses after treating the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Among the proteins in the CEBP TF family, only C/ebpδ showed Cop1 -dependent protein degradation with MG132 treatment ( Figure 4 E). To further evaluate the effect of C/ebpδ on tumor progression following Cop1 loss of function in mouse TNBC models, we implanted 4T1 cells with only Cop1 KO or 4T1 cells harboring Cop1 and C/ebpδ KO into the mammary fat pads of BALB/c hosts ( Figure 4 F). We observed that tumor growth of Cop1 KO 4T1 cells is fully rescued by C/ebpδ KO ( Figure 4 G), indicating that C/ebpδ accumulation induced by Cop1 dysfunction is responsible for suppression of 4T1 tumor growth. These results provide evidence that, in 4T1 cells, C/ebpδ is a specific protein substrate of Cop1 that mediates increased chromatin accessibility, decreased target gene expression, and slower tumor growth upon Cop1 KO.
To map C/ebpδ binding sites and target genes, we performed C/ebpδ ChIP-seq experiments in 4T1 cells with or without Cop1 KO. Consistent with the increased C/ebpδ protein abundance upon Cop1 KO, there was an overall larger number of upregulated C/ebpδ binding peaks ( Figure 5 A) with corresponding greater chromatin accessibility ( Figure 5 B). Motif analysis found the CEBP motif to be the most enriched motif in upregulated C/ebpδ peaks and the AP-1 family member Fos motif to be most enriched in downregulated C/ebpδ peaks ( Figure 5 C). This suggests that upregulated C/ebpδ peaks are the primary effect of Cop1 KO on C/ebpδ .
To assess which gene sets are regulated by C/ebpδ in 4T1 cancer cells, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes upon Cop1 KO near the C/ebpδ binding sites by Cistrome-GO, an algorithm we developed previously for integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data ( Li et al., 2019 60. Li, S. ∙ Wan, C. ∙ Zheng, R. ... Cistrome-GO: a web server for functional enrichment analysis of transcription factor ChIP-seq peaks Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W206-W211 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the downregulated genes are significantly associated with regulation of immune response genes and macrophage chemokines ( Figure S5 F), such as Ccl2 and Ccl7 ( Figure 5 D). In contrast, C/ebpδ binding sites near genes that are upregulated upon Cop1 KO are enriched in amino acid metabolism and peptide biosynthesis ( Figure S5 F). To further evaluate the transcriptional effects of immune response genes and macrophage chemokines by C/ebpδ , we performed RNA-seq analysis of C/ebpδ KO. We confirmed that KO of C/ebpδ has opposite effects compared with Cop1 KO on regulation of cytokines and cytokine receptors, especially macrophage-related cytokines in 4T1 cells ( Figure 5 E; Figure S5 G). Pathways downregulated upon Cop1 KO ( Figure 3 C) were also upregulated in C/ebpδ KO ( Figure 5 F). Our results indicate that Cop1 KO decreased proteasomal degradation of C/ebpδ and that the stabilized C/ebpδ suppresses transcription of immune response genes and macrophage cytokines.
To evaluate whether the Cop1 effect on macrophage infiltration and tumor progression in mouse TNBC models ( Figures 2 E and 3 G) is relevant in human tumors, we examined public tumor cohorts. COP1 is more highly expressed in tumor samples compared with adjacent normal samples across many cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ( Figure S5 H), including breast and colon cancers. Furthermore, COP1 expression is positively correlated with the M2 macrophage signature inferred from previous studies ( Jiang et al., 2018 45. Jiang, P. ∙ Gu, S. ∙ Pan, D. ... Signatures of T cell dysfunction and exclusion predict cancer immunotherapy response Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1550-1558 Crossref Scopus (529) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2020 61.

TIMER2.0 for analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :W509-W514 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas CEBPD expression is negatively correlated with the M2 macrophage signature ( Figure 5 G). An in vitro Cop1 KO signature of differentially expressed genes ( STAR Methods ), which may reflect C/ebpδ protein activity, was also correlated negatively with macrophage infiltration inferred from multiple algorithms ( Li et al., 2017 58. Li, T. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Wang, B. ... TIMER: A Web Server for Comprehensive Analysis of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells Cancer Res. 2017; 77 :e108-e110 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 60.

Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :773-782 Crossref Scopus (493) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 G; Figures S5 I and S5J). Moreover, by analyzing the proteomics profile of different human breast and colon cancer cell lines ( Nusinow et al., 2020 85. Nusinow, D.P. ∙ Szpyt, J. ∙ Ghandi, M. ... Quantitative Proteomics of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Cell. 2020; 180 :387-402.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ), we confirmed the positive association between COP1 protein and macrophage-associated cytokines in human cancer cell lines, including CCL2 , CCL7 , and other downregulated chemokines, upon Cop1 KO in 4T1 cells ( Figure S5 K). We further evaluated the correlation between COP1 expression and survival of affected individuals in TCGA cohorts. Lower COP1 expression in tumors is associated with better outcomes in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and papillary kidney cancers ( Figures S5 L–S5N). These data indicate a robust association of high Cop1 and low C/ebpδ expression with increased macrophage infiltration across human cancers.
To elucidate how Cop1 degrades the C/ebpδ protein, we screened proteins that were upregulated upon Cop1 KO for the presence of a predicted Cop1 degron motif ( Figures S6 A–S6C). To this end, we applied a machine learning approach (see STAR Methods for further details) that was predictive of previously reported degrons in known Cop1 substrates ( Figure S6 B). This analysis predicted several proteins as the most likely direct Cop1 substrates in 4T1, including Trib2 ( Tribbles homolog 2), Tanc1 (tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 1), Tex2 (testis expressed 2), and the known substrate Ets1 (ETS proto-oncogene 1) ( Figure 4 D; see STAR Methods for further details). Surprisingly, the predicted substrates did not include C/ebpδ or any CEBP family member, suggesting that C/ebpδ might be an indirect substrate of Cop1 . We noted that Trib2 , the protein with a Cop1 degron whose level is most elevated upon Cop1 KO, has been reported previously to serve as a substrate adaptor for Cop1 to modulate its specificity ( Figure S6 D; Keeshan et al., 2006 47. Keeshan, K. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Wouters, B.J. ... Tribbles homolog 2 inactivates C/EBPalpha and causes acute myelogenous leukemia Cancer Cell. 2006; 10 :401-411 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). TRIB family pseudokinases possess a C-terminal tail that serves as a peptide motif for MAPKK/MEK family members and a second binding motif that facilitates direct association with E3 ubiquitin ligases ( Eyers et al., 2017 25. Eyers, P.A. ∙ Keeshan, K. ∙ Kannan, N. Tribbles in the 21st Century: The Evolving Roles of Tribbles Pseudokinases in Biology and Disease Trends Cell Biol. 2017; 27 :284-298 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). In human or mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML), TRIB pseudokinases are known to provide a unique molecular scaffold bound by C/ebpα and Cop1 ( Eyers et al., 2017 25. Eyers, P.A. ∙ Keeshan, K. ∙ Kannan, N.

Molecular Mechanism of CCAAT-Enhancer Binding Protein Recruitment by the TRIB1 Pseudokinase Structure. 2015; 23 :2111-2121 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, C/ ebpδ , but not C/ ebpα , was detected at the protein level in 4T1 cells. Based on this, we hypothesized that Trib2 might serve as an adaptor to facilitate the interaction between C/ebpδ and Cop1 , leading to Cop1 -mediated proteasomal degradation of C/ebpδ ( Figure 6 A).
To test this hypothesis, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) in wild-type 4T1 cells. This confirmed co-binding of endogenous Cop1 , Trib2 , and C/ebpδ ( Figure 6 B; Figures S6 E and S6F). Furthermore, we found that, although Cop1 KO did not significantly increase Trib2 and C/ebpδ mRNA levels ( Figure S6 G), it significantly increased their protein levels ( Figure 6 C). In addition, forced overexpression of Cop1 led to a decreased C/ebpδ protein level without affecting its mRNA ( Figure 6 D; Figure S6 H), supporting C/ebpδ post-translational regulation by Cop1 .
To confirm that C/ebpδ degradation is mediated by the proteasome pathway, we treated 4T1 cells with the selective proteasome inhibitor MG132. We observed that, with proteasome inhibition, the Trib2 and C/ebpδ proteins were significantly more abundant than in wild-type cells regardless of Cop1 status ( Figure 6 E). Moreover, the polyubiquitination level of C/ebpδ was attenuated by Cop1 KO in 4T1 cells and elevated with proteasome inhibition ( Figure S6 I). These results indicate that Cop1 can induce degradation of C/ebpδ through a proteasomal degradation pathway.
Cop1 -dependent proteasomal degradation is notoriously complex ( Marine, 2012 66. Marine, J.-C. Spotlight on the role of COP1 in tumorigenesis Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 :455-464 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been reported that Cop1 can directly induce transfer of ubiquitin from E2 proteins to some of its substrates ( Dornan et al., 2004a 21. Dornan, D. ∙ Wertz, I. ∙ Shimizu, H. ... The ubiquitin ligase COP1 is a critical negative regulator of p53 Nature. 2004; 429 :86-92 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ; Seo et al., 2003 103. Seo, H.S. ∙ Yang, J.-Y. ∙ Ishikawa, M. ... LAF1 ubiquitination by COP1 controls photomorphogenesis and is stimulated by SPA1 Nature. 2003; 423 :995-999 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ) or indirectly promote degradation by linking some substrates to an E3 ligase complex, such as the CUL4A-DDB1 complex ( Vitari et al., 2011 112. Vitari, A.C. ∙ Leong, K.G. ∙ Newton, K. ... COP1 is a tumour suppressor that causes degradation of ETS transcription factors Nature. 2011; 474 :403-406 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wertz et al., 2004 121. Wertz, I.E. ∙ O’Rourke, K.M. ∙ Zhang, Z. ... Human De-etiolated-1 regulates c-Jun by assembling a CUL4A ubiquitin ligase Science. 2004; 303 :1371-1374 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). We evaluated whether Cop1 acts as an adaptor protein by bringing C/ebpδ to the Cul4a-Ddb1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation. We treated 4T1 cells with the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 and observed decreased C/ebpδ protein levels under neddylation inhibitor treatment ( Figure 6 F), suggesting that C/ebpδ degradation by Cop1 works through a Cullin-independent mechanism.
Finally, to prove that Trib2 is important in mediating Cop1 degradation of C/ebpδ , we used CRISPR to knock out Trib2 . This not only disrupted the interaction between Cop1 and C/ebpδ ( Figure 6 G) but also increased the level of C/ebpδ protein ( Figure 6 H). These results indicate that, in 4T1 cancer cells, C/ebpδ is a substrate of Cop1 and that the interaction between Cop1 and C/ebpδ is mediated by Trib2 , which results in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of C/ebpδ ( Figure 6 I). Cop1 inhibition, which stabilizes C/ebpδ to suppress macrophage chemoattractant release, can increase tumor sensitivity to immunity and immunotherapy ( Figure S6 J).

Section: Discussion

TNBC has an immunosuppressive TME, preventing an effective response to ICB therapies. There is an urgent need to identify new targets to reprogram the suppressive TNBC TME to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. In this study, we used large-scale CRISPR KO screens to discover genes that sensitize TNBC to anti-tumor immunity in host mice that differ in microenvironmental competency. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cop1 regulates the protein abundance of the TF C/ebpδ via the adaptor protein Trib2 . C/ebpδ transcriptionally suppresses macrophage chemoattractant release from cancer cells. Cop1 inhibition in TNBCs leads to decreased macrophage infiltration, increased sensitivity to anti-PD-1 treatment, and better survival in mouse models. We also observed associations between COP1 expression, levels of macrophage infiltration, and clinical outcomes in many human cancer types. Our study establishes a role of Cop1 in modulating macrophage infiltration into tumors and in suppressing the effects of immunotherapies.
Activation of the IFNγ signaling pathway in cancer cells has long been considered to facilitate T cell antigen recognition and activate T cell cytotoxicity ( Gao et al., 2016 30. Gao, J. ∙ Shi, L.Z. ∙ Zhao, H. ... Loss of IFN-γ Pathway Genes in Tumor Cells as a Mechanism of Resistance to Anti-CTLA-4 Therapy Cell. 2016; 167 :397-404.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). Paradoxically, we found breast cancer cells to be sensitized to immunotherapy by loss of function of Jak1 , Stat1 , or Irf1 , downstream effectors of the IFNγ signaling pathway. Supporting our observation, loss of Jak1 has been reported to prevent progression of breast cancer in mammary cancer models ( Chen et al., 2018b 12. Chen, M. ∙ Pockaj, B. ∙ Andreozzi, M. ...

Janus Kinase 1 Plays a Critical Role in Mammary Cancer Progression Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :2192-2207.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Studies in breast cancer and melanoma models also found that sustained IFNγ activation could have the opposite effect as short-term IFNγ treatment, inducing resistance to immunotherapy ( Benci et al., 2016 5. Benci, J.L. ∙ Xu, B. ∙ Qiu, Y. ... Tumor Interferon Signaling Regulates a Multigenic Resistance Program to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2016; 167 :1540-1554.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jacquelot et al., 2019 41. Jacquelot, N. ∙ Yamazaki, T. ∙ Roberti, M.P. ... Sustained Type I interferon signaling as a mechanism of resistance to PD-1 blockade Cell Res. 2019; 29 :846-861 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). This may explain why early-phase clinical trials of IFNγ failed in individuals with melanoma ( Meyskens et al., 1990 69. Meyskens, Jr., F.L. ∙ Kopecky, K. ∙ Samson, M. ... Recombinant human interferon gamma: adverse effects in high-risk stage I and II cutaneous malignant melanoma J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82 :1071 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , 1995 70. Meyskens, Jr., F.L. ∙ Kopecky, K.J. ∙ Taylor, C.W. ... Randomized trial of adjuvant human interferon gamma versus observation in high-risk cutaneous melanoma: a Southwest Oncology Group study J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87 :1710-1713 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the anti- and pro-tumor functions of IFNγ might depend on the tumor context, microenvironmental factors, signaling intensity, and signaling duration.
Over the past decade, Cop1 has been found to play an important role in tumor growth and metastasis ( Wei and Kaelin, 2011 120. Wei, W. ∙ Kaelin, Jr., W.G. Good COP1 or bad COP1? In vivo veritas J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :1263-1265 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). A number of potential Cop1 degradation substrates have been identified, including Tp53 , c-Jun , Cebpa , Mek1 , p65/RelA , Mkk4 , Acc1 , Mta1 , Foxo1 , Torc2 , and Pea3 ( Dornan et al., 2004a 21. Dornan, D. ∙ Wertz, I. ∙ Shimizu, H. ... The ubiquitin ligase COP1 is a critical negative regulator of p53 Nature. 2004; 429 :86-92 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ; Janic et al., 2018 43. Janic, A. ∙ Valente, L.J. ∙ Wakefield, M.J. ... DNA repair processes are critical mediators of p53-dependent tumor suppression Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :947-953 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Migliorini et al., 2011 73. Migliorini, D. ∙ Bogaerts, S. ∙ Defever, D. ... Cop1 constitutively regulates c-Jun protein stability and functions as a tumor suppressor in mice J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :1329-1343 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei and Kaelin, 2011 120. Wei, W. ∙ Kaelin, Jr., W.G. Good COP1 or bad COP1? In vivo veritas J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :1263-1265 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). With oncogene and tumor suppressor proteins as putative Cop1 substrates, characterization of Cop1 as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor has been inconsistent. Analysis of COP1 essentiality based on CRISPR screens of hundreds of cancer cell lines in the Dependency Map project shows generally weak effects on cell growth in human cancer cell lines in vitro ( Tsherniak et al., 2017 110. Tsherniak, A. ∙ Vazquez, F. ∙ Montgomery, P.G. ... Defining a Cancer Dependency Map Cell. 2017; 170 :564-576.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is consistent with the Cop1 KO phenotype we observed in mouse breast cancer (4T1) and colorectal cancer (MC38) cells grown in vitro . At the same time, Cop1 KO significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in wild-type mice, especially mice treated with ICB, compared with nude mice. This suggests that the effects of Cop1 on tumor progression act through TME reprogramming and immune response, implicating Cop1 as an immunotherapy target. In addition, our study revealed a possible mechanism of tumor growth suppression through decreased macrophage recruitment. However, cytokines and chemokines regulated by the Cop1-C/ebpδ pathway may influence not only macrophages but also other immune cell types in the TME. For example, Ccl2 was discovered as a chemoattractant for macrophages, but it also attracts monocytes, MDSCs, lymphocytes, and neutrophils under specific conditions ( Gschwandtner et al., 2019 36. Gschwandtner, M. ∙ Derler, R. ∙ Midwood, K.S. More Than Just Attractive: How CCL2 Influences Myeloid Cell Behavior Beyond Chemotaxis Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :2759 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it will be important to explore the effects of cytokines regulated by Cop1-C/ebpδ on other immune cell types. At the same time, we note that Cop1 is not only expressed in cancer cells but also in immune cells and in normal tissues. Therefore, future studies must evaluate systemic effects of Cop1 inhibition in vivo or in human cancers, especially when a small-molecule inhibitor of Cop1 is employed.
Our study found that, in cancer cells, Cop1 affects cancer progression through its influence on C/ebpδ proteasomal degradation. The CEBP family of TFs is known to regulate many biological processes, including cell differentiation, motility, proliferation, cell death, metabolism, and immune responses ( Ko et al., 2015 49. Ko, C.-Y. ∙ Chang, W.-C. ∙ Wang, J.-M. Biological roles of CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein delta during inflammation J. Biomed. Sci. 2015; 22 :6 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). A previous study reported that C/ebpα stability is required to prevent Trib1-Cop1 complex-driven AML ( Nakamae et al., 2017 78. Nakamae, I. ∙ Kato, J.-Y. ∙ Yokoyama, T. ... Myeloid leukemia factor 1 stabilizes tumor suppressor C/EBPα to prevent Trib1-driven acute myeloid leukemia Blood Adv. 2017; 1 :1682-1693 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another study found that aberrant C/ebpα protein levels caused by Trib1 deficiency in hematopoietic cells results in severe reduction of M2-like macrophages in the bone marrow, spleen, lungs, and adipose tissue ( Satoh et al., 2013 100. Satoh, T. ∙ Kidoya, H. ∙ Naito, H. ... Critical role of Trib1 in differentiation of tissue-resident M2-like macrophages Nature. 2013; 495 :524-528 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). A more recent study of Alzheimer’s disease reported that C/EBPβ in microglia, which drives a potent proinflammatory program, is regulated at the protein level by COP1 ( Ndoja et al., 2020 80. Ndoja, A. ∙ Reja, R. ∙ Lee, S.-H. ... Ubiquitin Ligase COP1 Suppresses Neuroinflammation by Degrading c/EBPβ in Microglia Cell. 2020; 182 :1156-1169.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we further showed the effect of Cop1 on macrophage infiltration and tumor growth through Trib2 and C/ebpδ in solid tumors. In addition, COP1 expression is associated with high macrophage infiltration, and the Cop1 KO signature is associated with low macrophage infiltration across many human cancer types.
Although the level of C/ebpδ protein is the most significantly changed CEBP family member upon Cop1 KO, it is not the only CEBP family member whose protein levels are affected. It is possible that, in other cancer types or immune cells, Cop1 KO could stabilize other CEBP family members that function in suppressing macrophage infiltration and tumor growth. In addition, our RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and proteomics analyses suggest that the AP-1 family of TFs might interact with C/ebpδ or mediate secondary effects upon Cop1 KO. Further studies are needed to pinpoint the specific AP-1 family members involved and to elucidate this interaction and its effect.
Currently available ICB antibodies, such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA4, aim to facilitate cancer cell recognition by lymphocytes and increase T cell cytotoxicity. However, the majority of human tumors, especially from breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancers, are tumors with low levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and most tumors generally elicit low immune activity. Therefore, recent cancer immunology research and immune-oncology drug development have been focused on reprogramming the TME by killing immunosuppressive fibroblasts ( Noy and Pollard, 2014 84. Noy, R. ∙ Pollard, J.W. Tumor-associated macrophages: from mechanisms to therapy Immunity. 2014; 41 :49-61 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1964) PubMed Google Scholar ) or macrophages ( Motz and Coukos, 2013 76. Motz, G.T. ∙ Coukos, G. Deciphering and reversing tumor immune suppression Immunity. 2013; 39 :61-73 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ) to help T cell infiltration. The fact that different syngeneic tumor models have such different TMEs indicates that cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms may determine whether a tumor supports an effective or ineffective immune response. Our study, together with previous work ( Codina et al., 2019 13. Codina, A. ∙ Renauer, P.A. ∙ Wang, G. ...

In vivo CRISPR screening identifies Ptpn2 as a cancer immunotherapy target Nature. 2017; 547 :413-418 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ), demonstrates the effectiveness of in vivo CRISPR screens in identifying such cancer-cell-intrinsic TME regulators. However, in the TME, it is possible that the cytokine effects derived from cancer cells on immune cells are short ranged; then, heterogeneous distributions of cytokines are a potential reason influencing the cell-extrinsic effects. These in vivo studies could only test a restricted set of genes in a limited number of syngeneic tumor models. Similar approaches applied to more genes in additional syngeneic models are likely to identify additional targets that can reprogram the TME to enhance immunotherapy response.

Section: Limitations of the study

Our observation showed that loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cop1 in TNBC cancer cells decreases secretion of macrophage-associated chemokines, reduces tumor macrophage infiltration, enhances antitumor immunity, and strengthens ICB response. We found that the effects of Cop1 on gene expression are largely mediated by proteasomal degradation of the C/ebpδ protein, but the mechanisms of C/ebpδ ’s regulation of downstream gene expression need better characterization. Our preliminary data showed that genes with the highest C/ebpδ binding can be upregulated or downregulated in C/ebpδ -KO cells, suggesting context-dependent gene expression regulation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, Cop1 has not been targeted successfully with effective therapeutic drugs, limiting the immediate translational value of targeting Cop1 . However, recent studies have developed small-molecule and/or PROTAC inhibitors for multiple other E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as MDM2 ( Tisato et al., 2017 109. Tisato, V. ∙ Voltan, R. ∙ Gonelli, A. ... MDM2/X inhibitors under clinical evaluation: perspectives for the management of hematological malignancies and pediatric cancer J. Hematol.

Functional TRIM24 degrader via conjugation of ineffectual bromodomain and VHL ligands Nat. Chem.

Electrophilic PROTACs that degrade nuclear proteins by engaging DCAF16 Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15 :737-746 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). We expect that Cop1 -targeting inhibitors can be developed in the near future to potentiate ICB therapy in TNBC.

All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and performed with approved protocol (16-005). Six to eight week old female BALB/c (Stock# 028) and BALB/c Foxn1 nu/nu (Stock# 194) were obtained from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA). Six to eight week old female C57BL/6 (Stock# 000664) and C57BL/6 Foxn1 nu/nu (Stock# 000819) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All animals were housed in standard individually ventilated, pathogen-free conditions, with 12h: 12h light cycle, room temperature (21-23°C) and 40%–60% relative humidity. When a cohort of animals were receiving multiple treatments, animals were randomized by 1) randomly assign animals to different groups using littermates, 2) random mixing of mice prior to treatment, maximizing the evenness or representation of mice from different cages in each group, and/or 3) random assignment of mice to each group, in order to minimize the effect of gender, litter, small difference in age, cage, housing position, where applicable. Average tumor sizes were consistent between treatment groups to account for selection bias.
Murine 4T1, EMT6, JC breast cancer cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured according to standard protocols. MCF7 and T47D human breast cancer cells were derived and cultured as previously described ( Xiao et al., 2018 123. Xiao, T. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Wang, X. ... Estrogen-regulated feedback loop limits the efficacy of estrogen receptor-targeted breast cancer therapy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :7869-7878 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). MC38 murine colon adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from Kai Wucherpfennig laboratory.
SgRNA design primarily targeted low G-C content regions of the genome. We assigned predicted performance scores to all possible sgRNAs targeting each gene, and selected top candidate sgRNAs with the highest predicted on-target KO efficiency and lowest off-target efficiency ( Chen et al., 2018a 11. Chen, C.-H. ∙ Xiao, T. ∙ Xu, H. ... Improved design and analysis of CRISPR knockout screens Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4095-4101 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2015 124. Xu, H. ∙ Xiao, T. ∙ Chen, C.-H. ... Sequence determinants of improved CRISPR sgRNA design Genome Res. 2015; 25 :1147-1157 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). Customized single-stranded oligonucleotide pools of CRISPR guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries were synthesized by Twist Bioscience (South San Francisco, CA). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into lentiviral CRISPR vector (lentiCRISPR-v2-puro) by Gibson assembly at estimated equal molar ratios to generate the large-scale mouse CRISPR library (MusCK and MusCK 2.0 libraries). The MusCK library consisted of 24,622 sgRNAs including 1,000 non-targeting controls (NTCs) and 23,622 unique sgRNAs targeting 4,787 gene locations in the genome. The MusCK 2.0 library consisted of 800 sgRNAs including 168 non-targeting controls (NTCs) and 632 unique sgRNAs targeting 79 gene locations in the genome. We were aware that in large-scale CRISPR screen efforts, the statistical power of discovery is particularly sensitive to the behavioral consistency of multiple sgRNAs for each target gene. “Outlier” behavior (extreme depletion or enrichment) of one sgRNA out of all sgRNAs targeting the same gene could result in a false positive result. We recognize that the CRISPR KO libraries designed by the Broad Institute are so far the most widely accepted in genomic screen studies; thus, we wanted to ensure that our findings by the MusCK library are reproducible when the Broad sgRNA design principles were applied. To this end, in the MusCK 2.0 library, eight sgRNAs (four designed by our group in MusCK, another four referenced from the Broad Institute’s Brie Mouse CRISPR Knockout Pool Library) ( Doench et al., 2016 19. Doench, J.G. ∙ Fusi, N. ∙ Sullender, M. ... Optimized sgRNA design to maximize activity and minimize off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9 Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :184-191 Crossref Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ) were designated to each candidate gene. An estimated library coverage of ∼300X (total colonies / sgRNAs) was achieved by electroporation. These libraries were subsequently sequence-verified by Illumina sequencing to ensure the high quality of sgRNA distribution.
The CRISPR library plasmids were transfected into HEK293FT cells at 90% confluence in 15cm tissue culture plates. Viral supernatant was collected at 48 hours and 72 hours post-transfection, filtered via a 0.45 μm filtration unit (Corning, Cat# 430770). The supernatant was subsequently aliquoted and stored in −80°C freezer until use.
Cancer cells were cultured according to standard protocols. Similar to our previous studies ( Fei et al., 2017 27. Fei, T. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Xiao, T. ... Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies HNRNPL as a prostate cancer dependency regulating RNA splicing Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E5207-E5215 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiao et al., 2018 123. Xiao, T. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Wang, X. ... Estrogen-regulated feedback loop limits the efficacy of estrogen receptor-targeted breast cancer therapy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :7869-7878 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), for the pooled large-scale CRISPR screen, a total of > 1 × 10 8 cancer cells were transduced with lentivirus containing the library described above at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ∼0.3. After puromycin selection for 3 days, ∼30% of the surviving cells were stored as Day-0-input samples at −80°C, and the rest of cells were cultured for in vitro or in vivo screenings. PCR of the regions targeted by the library was performed on genomic DNA to construct the sequencing library. Each library was sequenced at ∼30 million reads to achieve ∼300-fold coverage over the CRISPR library. Sequencing data were analyzed by using MAGeCK and MAGeCK-VISPR ( Li et al., 2014 55. Li, W. ∙ Xu, H. ∙ Xiao, T. ...

For genomic DNA extraction, two methods were used. Method 1: for cellular samples with a total number greater than 3 × 10 7 cells, or tumor samples from mice, a custom DNA extraction protocol was used. Briefly, frozen tumors were disrupted on dry ice, then resuspended in 7 mL of Lysis Buffer (400 mM Sodium chloride 10 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8) in a 15 mL conical tube, and 80 μL of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (Invitrogen) were added to the tumor/cell samples and incubated at 55°C for at least 6 hours. The next day, 80 μL of 20 mg/ml RNase A (Invitrogen) was added to the lysed sample, which was then inverted 10 times and incubated at 65°C for 60 minutes. Samples were cooled on ice before addition of 7 mL of pre-chilled phenol/chloroform (Ambion) to precipitate proteins. The samples were vortexed at high speed for 20 s and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Then, the upper aqueous phase was carefully decanted into a new 15 mL conical tube. Then 7 mL freshly prepared 70% ethanol was added to the tube, vortexed at high speed for 20 s and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Genomic DNA was visible as a small white pellet in each tube. The supernatant was discarded, 6 mL of 70% ethanol was added, the tube was inverted 10 times, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded by pouring; the tube was briefly spun, and remaining ethanol was removed using a P200 pipette. After air-drying for more than 30 minutes, the DNA changed appearance from a milky white pellet to slightly translucent. Then, 500 μL of nuclease-free water was added, the tube was incubated at 4°C overnight to fully resuspend the DNA. The next day, the gDNA samples were vortexed briefly. The gDNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). Method 2: for cellular samples with a total number < 1 × 10 7 cells, samples were subjected to Allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The sgRNA library readout was performed using a two-steps PCR strategy, where the first PCR includes enough genomic DNA to preserve full library complexity and the second PCR adds appropriate sequencing adapters to the products from the first PCR.
For PCR#1, a region containing sgRNA cassette was amplified using primers specific to the lentiCRISPR-v2 vector (Primers for sequencing library construction, see Data and code availability). PCR was performed using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB). For reactions using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, in PCR#1, the thermocycling parameters were: STEP TEMP TIME Initial Denaturation 98°C 30 s 18 Cycles 98°C 15 s 68°C 25 s 72°C 25 s Final Extension 72°C 2 minutes Hold 4°C Open table in a new tab
In each PCR#1, we used a different amount of gDNA per sample to capture the full representation of the screen. For example, ∼300X coverage of our genome-wide sgRNA library, gDNA from 3 × 10 7 cells was used, assuming 6.6 μg of gDNA for 10 6 cells, 200 μg of gDNA was used per sample (6-8 μg of gDNA per reaction). PCR#1 products for each biological sample were pooled and used for amplification with barcoded second PCR primers (see Data and code availability). For each sample, we performed at least 3 PCR#2 reactions using 2 μL of the pooled PCR#1 product per PCR#2 reactions for 10 PCR cycles. Second PCR products were pooled and gel purified from a 2% agarose gel using the MinElute Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN). Purified product concentration was measured using a Qubit (Thermo Scientific). All products were normalized for each biological sample before combining uniquely barcoded separate biological samples. The pooled products with 10%–20% PhiX were sequenced on HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina).
Plasmids (pCI-neo-sOVA, pCI-neo-mOVA, pCI-neo-cOVA, pcDNA3-OVA) were obtained from Addgene. Different forms of artificial tumor antigen ovalbumin sequence were subcloned into a lentiCRISPR-V2-blast vector via Gibson assembly to generate different Ova-expressing vectors (lentiV2-blast-sOva, lentiV2-blast-mOva, lentiV2-blast-cOva, lentiV2-blast-Ova).
4T1, EMT6 and MC38 murine cancer cells were transduced with artificial tumor antigen Ova-expressing lentivirus for 24 hours. After blasticidin selection for 3 days, transduced cancer cells were cultured individually in 10 cm tissue culture plates. One week later, ovalbumin expression levels of transduced cancer cells were identified by immunoblotting.
Transduced murine cancer cells were expanded in vitro for 1 week to allow genome editing before being implanted into animals. Cancer cells were either injected into the mammary fat pads of mice or subcutaneously with Matrigel (1:1 dilution). Cancer cells were implanted into both flanks of 10-12 Foxn1 nu/nu mice, 10-12 wild-type mice, 10-12 wild-type mice treated with ovalbumin, and 10-12 wild-type mice treated with ovalbumin and PD-1 blockade. Cancer cells transduced with libraries were also grown in vitro at approximately 1000X library coverage for the same time period as the animal experiment. Mice were vaccinated with ovalbumin twice (once a week) 14 days before cancer cell transplantation. Subsequently, mice were treated with 100 μg of rat monoclonal anti-PD-1 (clone: 29F.1A12) on days 9 and 12 via intraperitoneal injection. Mice were euthanized 16–19 days after tumor implantation and tumor genomic DNA was isolated from whole tumor tissue using a DNA extraction protocol (see above). PCR was used to amplify the sgRNA region and sequencing to determine sgRNA abundance was performed on an Illumina HiSeq. Significantly enriched or depleted sgRNAs from any comparison of conditions were identified using the MAGeCK algorithm.
Ten thousand cancer cells (4T1, MC38) were either injected into the mammary fat pads of mice or subcutaneously with Matrigel (1:1 dilution). Tumors were measured every three days beginning on day 7 after challenge until time of death. Death was defined as the point at which a progressively growing tumor reached 2.0 cm in the longest dimension. Measurements were taken manually by collecting the longest dimension (length) and the longest perpendicular dimension (width). Tumor volume was estimated with the formula: (L × W 2 ) / 2. CO 2 inhalation was used to euthanize mice on the day of euthanasia. Optimal group sizes were determined empirically. Researchers were not blinded to group identity and randomization of animal groups was done when appropriate.
Cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plates (500 cells per well for short time proliferation or 100 cells per well for long time proliferation), cultured 4 or 8 days before cell counting, and biologically replicated three times. For cell counting, samples were subjected to Cell Counting Kit 8 (Dojindo) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Pellets from 5 × 10 6 cells were collected and digested by 500 μL RIPA Buffer (Invitrogen). Samples were incubated on ice for at least 15 minutes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, then subjected to BCA analysis (Thermo scientific, Cat# 23228). Approximately 40 μg of total protein from each sample was loaded for western blot analysis.
Tumors for flow cytometry were broken down into smaller fragments, about the size of lentils, then dissociated with 1 mg/ml Collagenase IV for 30 minutes using GentleMacs Octo Dissociator from Miltenyi, and cell suspensions were passed through 70 μm filter twice before staining. Single cancer cells were washed with ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS and stained with antibodies at 4°C for 30 minutes. Cancer cells were then washed and resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS for flow cytometry. All data acquisition was done using an LSR II (BD) or FACS Calibur (BD Biosiences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar) for statistical computing.
Cancer cells were engineered to express EGFP or mCherry by lentiviral transduction to different populations. Cas9-target sgRNA-transfected cells and Cas9-control sgRNA-transfected cells were mixed and then grown for at least two passages in vitro before implantation into mice. Mixes were analyzed by flow cytometry on the day of tumor inoculation. Tumors were harvested and incubated in Collagenase IV for at least 30 minutes. After incubation, cancer cells were passed through 70 μm filters to remove undigested tumors. Single cancer cells were washed with ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS and stained with Near-IR Live/Dead (BD Biosciences) on ice for 30 minutes. Cancer cells were then washed and resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS. An LSR II (BD Biosciences) was used to analyze final EGFP/mCherry cancer cell ratios.
Chemokine expression levels in the culture supernatants were measured using the Mouse Cytokine Array C1000 (Raybiotech). This assay was used to quantify the concentration of chemokines secreted by cancer cells, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The results were further normalized with protein concentration of tumor cell lysates in the same experiment.
Construction of lenti-CRISPR/Cas9 vectors targeting Cop1 was performed following the protocol associated with the backbone vector lentiCRISPR V2 (Cat# 49535, Addgene). The sgRNA sequences used are listed in the Key resources table. 4T1 and MC38 cells were infected with lentivirus expressing sgRNAs targeting specific genes. After puromycin selection, cells were expanded and collected, and knockout was verified by western blot analyses.
Total RNA was isolated and purified from the cells using Isol-RNA Lysis Reagent (Fisher) and treated with DNase I (Fisher). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TrueSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 150 base paired end reads.
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from cancer cells. Then, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Approximately 50 ng cDNA from each sample was mixed with gene-specific primers (Table S7) and SsoAdvanced™ universal SYBR® Green supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Reactions were performed on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Mouse 4T1 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates for 3 days. Each sample of 1 × 10 5 cells was trypsinized and resuspended in 50 uL cold ATAC-resuspension buffer (RSB) (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl 2 in water) supplemented with 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin. After 3 minute incubation on ice, 1 mL ATAC-RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 was added, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at maximum speed at 4 ° C. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μL of transposition mix: 2.5 μL transposase (100 nM final), 16.5 μL 1X PBS, 0.5 μL 1% digitonin, 0.5 μL 10% Tween-20, and 5 μL water. Transposition reactions were performed at 37 ° C for 30 minutes in a thermomixer, while shaking at 1000 rpm. All samples were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 150 base paired end reads.
4T1 cells were plated in 15 cm tissue culture plates and cultured for 3 days. For C/ebpδ ChIP-seq, approximately 1 × 10 7 cells per condition were harvested and crosslinked by a two-step fixation, including 2 m Mdisuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, LifeTechnologies) treatment for 45 minutes and followed by 10 minutes fixation using 1% methanol-free formaldehyde at room temperature ( Eeckhoute et al., 2007 23.

Optimized ChIP-seq method facilitates transcription factor profiling in human tumors Life science alliance. 2018; 2 :e201800115 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were lysed in 1% SDS lysis buffer and sheared to 200-700 bp in size using the Covaris E220 ultrasonicator (PIP 140, DF 5%, CPB 200). Approximately 50 mg of sheared chromatin per condition were diluted and then incubated over night with 5 ug C/ebpδ antibody (ab245214, Abcam). Precipitates were then washed with following buffers: RIPA 0 buffer (0.1% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), RIPA 0.3 buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl) and LiCl buffer (250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris-HCl). DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Smarter Thruplex DNaseq kit (Takara Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 150 bp paired-end reads.
Mouse breast cancer cells were lysed in Tris buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 5% glycerol, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 30 minutes with gentle rocking at 4 ° C. Cell lysate was spun down by a centrifuge in cold room at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes and then supernatant was collected and incubated with different antibodies coupled to Protein A/G agarose beads (Pierce Biotechnology) at 4 ° C overnight (12 hours). Beads were washed extensively in Tris lysis buffercontaining 0.5 M NaCl and then eluted in LDS-sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysate was supplemented with 4X SDS loading buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl, 0.4 M DTT, 8.0% SDS, 6 mM Bromophenol blue, 4.3 M Glycerol) and heated at 95 ° C for 15 minutes before western blot analysis.
Tumors grown in mice were harvested and broken down into smaller fragments, about the size of millet. Then, each sample was digested with reagents from Mouse Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi, Cat# 130-096-730) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using GentleMacs Octo Dissociator from Miltenyi, and cell suspensions were passed through a 70 μm filter twice before staining. Single tumor cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 2% FBS and stained with CD45.2-APC/Cy7 antibody (BioLegend, Cat#109823) at 4°C for 45 minutes. All cells were then washed and resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS. Live CD45.2 positive cells were sorted with BD Aria after staining. Each tumor from the same group was processed individually and mixed together according to the same cell number. After cell collection, immune cells were resuspended at 1x10 6 cells/mL in PBS-0.04% BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# AM2616). Single cell suspensions of all samples were then barcoded with a 10x Chromium Controller (10x Genomics). RNA from the barcoded cells for each sample was subsequently reverse-transcribed and sequencing libraries were constructed with reagents from a Chromium Single Cell 30 v2 reagent kit (10x Genomics, Cat#PN-120267) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed with Illumina HiSeq according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina).

Li, W. ∙ Xu, H. ∙ Xiao, T. ... MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :554 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, raw sequencing data are pre-processed by using MAGeCK to obtain the read counts for each sgRNA. Control sgRNAs are used to normalize the data. MAGeCK TEST algorithm is used to compare treatment with control samples to obtain the significantly enriched and depleted sgRNAs and genes. Genes with p value less than 0.001 are candidate hits. The MaGeCKFlute package was used to visualize the data ( Wang et al., 2019 117. Wang, B. ∙ Wang, M. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Integrative analysis of pooled CRISPR genetic screens using MAGeCKFlute Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :756-780 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Read alignment was performed using STAR (v2.6.1) ( Dobin et al., 2013 18. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (14044) PubMed Google Scholar ). To quantify gene expression values, we used Salmon to calculate Transcripts Per Million (TPM) and read counts using the aligned reads from STAR as input ( Patro et al., 2017 88. Patro, R. ∙ Duggal, G. ∙ Love, M.I. ... Salmon provides fast and bias-aware quantification of transcript expression Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :417-419 Crossref Scopus (2351) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential gene expression analysis was then performed using DESeq2 with a FDR threshold of 0.05 ( Love et al., 2014 63. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (22550) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the in vitro RNA-seq was performed in two batches, the batch of the sample was considered as a covariate in DESeq2. Similarly, log-transformed TPM values were batch-effect corrected using the remove Batch Effect function in LIMMA ( Ritchie et al., 2015 98. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (10825) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the clusterProfiler R package with 100,000 permutations ( Yu et al., 2012 126. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.-G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (6893) PubMed Google Scholar ).
ChiLin pipeline 2.0.0 is used for QC and preprocessing of the ATAC-seq ( Qin et al., 2016 92. Qin, Q. ∙ Mei, S. ∙ Wu, Q. ... ChiLin: a comprehensive ChIP-seq and DNase-seq quality control and analysis pipeline BMC Bioinformatics. 2016; 17 :404 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). We use Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) as a read mapping tool ( Li and Durbin, 2009 53. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (22436) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qin et al., 2016 92. Qin, Q. ∙ Mei, S. ∙ Wu, Q. ... ChiLin: a comprehensive ChIP-seq and DNase-seq quality control and analysis pipeline BMC Bioinformatics. 2016; 17 :404 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS2) as a peak caller ( Zhang et al., 2008 127. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (7168) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a q-value (FDR) threshold of 0.01. Based on a dynamic poisson distribution, MACS2 can effectively capture local biases in the genome sequence, allowing for more sensitive and robust prediction of binding sites. Unique read for 48 a position for peak calling is used to reduce false positive peaks, statically significant peaks are finally selected by calculated false discovery rate of reported peaks. Deeptools is used for the heatmap plots ( Ramírez et al., 2016 97. Ramírez, F. ∙ Ryan, D.P. ∙ Grüning, B. ... deepTools2: a next generation web server for deep-sequencing data analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W160-5 Crossref Scopus (1616) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2008 127. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (7168) PubMed Google Scholar ). ATAC-seq Peaks from all study samples were merged to create a union set of sites. Read densities were calculated for each peak for each sample, differential peaks between WT and KO were identified by DEseq2 with adjusted p ≤ 0.05, |log2fold change| ≥ 1.
Cell Ranger (10x Genomics; v3.1.0) was used to align the reads to the mm10 genome and generate the count matrix with default settings. Low-quality cells containing less than 200 genes detected were removed. Genes that were present in less than 3 cells were excluded from the analysis. Seurat (v4.0.1) was used for integration ( Stuart et al., 2019 105. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2322) PubMed Google Scholar ), normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and UMAP visualization. Annotation for each cluster was performed by using MAESTRO with the “RNAAnnotateCelltype” function and “human.immune.CIBERSORT” gene signature ( Wang et al., 2020 118. Wang, C. ∙ Sun, D. ∙ Huang, X. ... Integrative analyses of single-cell transcriptome and regulome using MAESTRO Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :198 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other downstream analyses were performed with custom R (v 4.0.5) scripts.
The ChiLin pipeline was used to analyze Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of C/ebpδ ( Qin et al., 2016 92. Qin, Q. ∙ Mei, S. ∙ Wu, Q. ... ChiLin: a comprehensive ChIP-seq and DNase-seq quality control and analysis pipeline BMC Bioinformatics. 2016; 17 :404 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the bwa aligner was used to map reads to the mm10 reference genome. MACS2 (v2.1.4) was used to call ChIP-seq peaks using the command line parameters “-SPMR -B -q 0.01 –keep-dup 1” ( Zhang et al., 2008 127. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (7168) PubMed Google Scholar ). A random subsample of 4 million reads were used to assess quality control. Quality control consisted of five metrics: 1) the average read quality according to FastQC ( de Sena Brandine and Smith, 2019 15. de Sena Brandine, G. ∙ Smith, A.D. Falco: high-speed FastQC emulation for quality control of sequencing data F1000Res. 2019; 8 :1874 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ); 2) the fraction of uniquely mapped reads; 3) a PCR bottleneck coefficient, which is the fraction of locations with one uniquely mapped read; 4) fraction of reads in peaks according to MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 127. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (7168) PubMed Google Scholar ) (more, the better); 5) overlap of peaks with DNA hypersensitivity sites. All samples were of adequate quality. To provide a consistent peak set across multiple samples for downstream analysis, we merged overlapping peaks using bedtools v2.29.2 ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 94. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (9542) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential peak analysis between Rosa26 and Cop1 KO was then performed using DESeq2 with a False Discovery Rate threshold of 0.05 and |log2FC| > 0.5 ( Love et al., 2014 63. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (22550) PubMed Google Scholar ). A heatmap visualizing the peaks was then generated using the deeptools package (v3.3.0) ( Ramírez et al., 2016 97. Ramírez, F. ∙ Ryan, D.P. ∙ Grüning, B. ... deepTools2: a next generation web server for deep-sequencing data analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W160-5 Crossref Scopus (1616) PubMed Google Scholar ). KEGG pathway enrichment of the upregulated C/ebpδ peaks was then conducted using Cistrome GO ( Li et al., 2019 60. Li, S. ∙ Wan, C. ∙ Zheng, R. ... Cistrome-GO: a web server for functional enrichment analysis of transcription factor ChIP-seq peaks Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W206-W211 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A degron sequence motif for Cop1 was downloaded from the Eukaryotic Linear Motif Database ( Gouw et al., 2018 33. Gouw, M. ∙ Michael, S. ∙ Sámano-Sánchez, H. ... The eukaryotic linear motif resource - 2018 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D428-D434 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was represented by the regular expression “[STDE]{1,3}.{0,2}[TSDE].{2,3}VP[STDE]G{0,1}[FLIMVYPA].” Protein sequences from the mouse and human proteome were downloaded (10/2/2019) from the Swiss-Prot reviewed sequences of the UniProt database ( UniProt Consortium, 2019 111. UniProt Consortium UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D506-D515 Crossref Scopus (2893) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cop1 degron sequence motif was then searched against Swiss-Prot sequences using the python “re” package. This resulted in 1,196 hits (1,067 genes) in mice and 1,328 (1,010 genes) in humans.
Not all instances of a sequence motif may be a biologically plausible degron. To further refine plausible candidates, we developed a model to predict the potential of a motif to be a degron. A Random Forest algorithm was trained (number of trees = 1,000) on 83 features from the SNVBox database ( UniProt Consortium, 2019 111. UniProt Consortium UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D506-D515 Crossref Scopus (2893) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wong et al., 2011 122. Wong, W.C. ∙ Kim, D. ∙ Carter, H. ... CHASM and SNVBox: toolkit for detecting biologically important single nucleotide mutations in cancer Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :2147-2148 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) to distinguish previously reported degrons (n = 186) ( Mészáros et al., 2017 68. Mészáros, B. ∙ Kumar, M. ∙ Gibson, T.J. ... Degrons in cancer Sci. Signal. 2017; 10 :eaak9982 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) from random other sequences within the same set of proteins (n = 186). Features spanned characterization of evolutionary conservation to biophysical features of amino acid residues within a protein. To summarize features across the multiple amino acid residues in a motif, we took the average of each feature. Evaluated using 20-fold cross-validation, performance as measured by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (auROC) was 0.81 out of 1.0 (p = 2 × 10 −25 , Mann-Whitney U test).
Given the large number of motif hits found in mice, we filtered out those not also seen in humans or which had low degron potential according to machine learning predictions. Of the 1,067 genes with motif hits in mice, 448 showed overlap in humans. After filtering for a high Random Forest score (> 0.5 out of 1.0), 117 high-scoring motifs remained. Among the high scoring candidates, numerous were for previously reported Cop1 substrates, such as Ets1, Etv5 and Jun ( Marine, 2012 66. Marine, J.-C. Spotlight on the role of COP1 in tumorigenesis Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 :455-464 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We created an RNA expression gene signature for Cop1 KO based on the top 500 differentially expressed genes (250 upregulated, 250 downregulated). Genes within the signature were weighted by their log2 fold change values reported by DESeq2 in the Cop1 KO versus Rosa26
(control) condition without IFNG treatment. Only mouse genes with a corresponding human gene were used. A Cop1 signature score was computed by a weighted linear combination of Cop1 KO log2 fold changes with normalized expression values from TCGA (see below).
RSEM quantifications (v2) for RNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was downloaded from the genomic data commons ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ ). RNA expression was then log2 normalized, followed by subtracting the median expression value for each gene across the cohort.
Immune cell infiltration was inferred from bulk RNA-seq data using the immunedeconv R package ( Sturm et al., 2019 106. Sturm, G. ∙ Finotello, F. ∙ Petitprez, F. ... Comprehensive evaluation of transcriptome-based cell-type quantification methods for immuno-oncology Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :i436-i445 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), which contains estimates based on 6 different methods (CIBERSORT (absolute mode), TIMER, xCell, EPIC, MCP-counter, quanTIseq) ( Aran et al., 2017 2.

Cop1 signature scores were then analyzed for their correlation with immune cell infiltration estimates, after adjusting for tumor purity (partial spearman correlation, see ( Li et al., 2017 58. Li, T. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Wang, B. ... TIMER: A Web Server for Comprehensive Analysis of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells Cancer Res. 2017; 77 :e108-e110 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar )). Benjamini-Hochberg correction was then applied across all p values and a correlation was deemed significant at a FDR < 0.05.
To analyze genes that may impact the tumor-immune microenvironment, we curated a set of cytokine and surface receptor related genes: “Cytokine-Cytokine Receptor Interaction” pathway from KEGG database and surface receptor/ligand genes as reported previously ( Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 46.
