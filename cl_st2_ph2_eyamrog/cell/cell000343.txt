Title: The long-term genetic stability and individual specificity of the human gut microbiome


Abstract: Summary

By following up the gut microbiome, 51 human phenotypes and plasma levels of 1,183 metabolites in 338 individuals after 4 years, we characterize microbial stability and variation in relation to host physiology. Using these individual-specific and temporally stable microbial profiles, including bacterial SNPs and structural variations, we develop a microbial fingerprinting method that shows up to 85% accuracy in classifying metagenomic samples taken 4 years apart. Application of our fingerprinting method to the independent HMP cohort results in 95% accuracy for samples taken 1 year apart. We further observe temporal changes in the abundance of multiple bacterial species, metabolic pathways, and structural variation, as well as strain replacement. We report 190 longitudinal microbial associations with host phenotypes and 519 associations with plasma metabolites. These associations are enriched for cardiometabolic traits, vitamin B, and uremic toxins. Finally, mediation analysis suggests that the gut microbiome may influence cardiometabolic health through its metabolites.

Section: Introduction

The gut microbiota also undergoes compositional changes over the course of an individual’s life, as either the cause or consequence of changes in host health and disease status ( Chen et al., 2018 10.

Nevertheless, several important questions about the temporal variability of the gut microbiome remain unexplored. First, beyond gut microbial composition, the genetic makeup of microbial genomes can also undergo dynamic changes over time. Microbial genomic changes due to evolution and strain replacement, such as single-nucleotide mutations and gain or loss of genomic regions (structural variation), are implicated in the development of human disease ( Greenblum et al., 2015 24. Greenblum, S. ∙ Carr, R. ∙ Borenstein, E.

Zeevi, D. ∙ Korem, T. ∙ Godneva, A. ... Structural variation in the gut microbiome associates with host health Nature. 2019; 568 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet investigations of temporal changes in microbial genetic makeup are still missing. Second, while cross-sectional association analyses have reported numerous associations with host health and disease ( Falony et al., 2016 18. Falony, G. ∙ Joossens, M. ∙ Vieira-Silva, S. ... Population-level analysis of gut microbiome variation Science. 2016; 352 :560-564 Crossref Scopus (1536) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lloyd-Price et al., 2017 32.

Strains, functions and dynamics in the expanded Human Microbiome Project Nature. 2017; 550 :61-66 Crossref Scopus (772) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rothschild et al., 2018 44. Rothschild, D. ∙ Weissbrod, O. ∙ Barkan, E. ... Environment dominates over host genetics in shaping human gut microbiota Nature. 2018; 555 :210-215 Crossref Scopus (1803) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhernakova et al., 2016 67. Zhernakova, A. ∙ Kurilshikov, A. ∙ Bonder, M.J. ..., LifeLines cohort study Population-based metagenomics analysis reveals markers for gut microbiome composition and diversity Science. 2016; 352 :565-569 Crossref Scopus (1278) PubMed Google Scholar ), these associations lack longitudinal confirmation that would allow us to assess whether alterations of the gut microbiome are related to changes in host health status. Third, other microbial components such as antibiotic resistance and virulence factors have become a major concern given the wide-scale use of antibiotics in the last decades. The risk of transfer of resistance and virulence genes between microorganisms has been extensively investigated due to its relevance to human health ( Ochman et al., 2000 39. Ochman, H. ∙ Lawrence, J.G. ∙ Groisman, E.A. Lateral gene transfer and the nature of bacterial innovation Nature. 2000; 405 :299-304 Crossref Scopus (2830) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, information on the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among human gut-commensal microorganisms over time has not been reported, which impedes the effective prevention and treatment of bacterial infections.
In this study, we present a long-term follow-up analysis of the gut microbiome in 338 participants of the population-based Lifelines-DEEP cohort ( Tigchelaar et al., 2015 50. Tigchelaar, E.F. ∙ Zhernakova, A. ∙ Dekens, J.A. ... Cohort profile: LifeLines DEEP, a prospective, general population cohort study in the northern Netherlands: study design and baseline characteristics BMJ Open. 2015; 5 :e006772 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ) in which we compare samples taken 4 years apart. We characterized long-term temporal stability in gut microbial composition and genetic makeup and aimed to answer two types of questions: (1) which bacterial features are both individual specific and temporally stable? Can we use these features as a “fingerprint” to distinguish samples from the same individual? and (2) which bacterial features show large temporal variation? Can their temporal variation be linked to changes in the host’s clinical phenotypes and lifestyle? To gain further biological insights, we profiled plasma levels of 1,183 metabolites at both time points and used mediation analysis as an in silico method to infer whether metabolites mediate the causal relationship behind the microbial impact on host health. Finally, we assessed the changes in antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in the human gut microbiome.

Section: Results

To investigate the long-term variability of the human gut microbiome, we collected fecal samples from 338 individuals from the prospective, population-based Lifelines-DEEP (LLD) cohort taken 4 years apart ( Tigchelaar et al., 2015 50. Tigchelaar, E.F. ∙ Zhernakova, A. ∙ Dekens, J.A. ... Cohort profile: LifeLines DEEP, a prospective, general population cohort study in the northern Netherlands: study design and baseline characteristics BMJ Open. 2015; 5 :e006772 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ) and processed these samples using the same lab protocols and bioinformatic pipelines. 51 phenotypic factors were assessed at both time points, including anthropometric traits (e.g., age, sex, and body mass index [BMI]), blood cell counts, biochemical measurements (e.g., glucose, HbA1c, and blood lipid profile), diseases, and medication usage ( Table S1 ). For 22 continuous traits, we observed significant temporal changes in 19 phenotypic factors at a false discovery rate (FDR) Paired Wilcoxon <0.05 ( Table S1 ). For instance, significant increases were observed for plasma levels of creatinine (P Paired Wilcoxon = 2.5 × 10 −50 ) and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P Paired Wilcoxon = 3.6 × 10 −26 and 2.2 × 10 −3 ) ( Figure S1 ). We also observed changes in lifestyle, diseases, and medication usage ( Table S1 ). For example, 26 participants developed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), while 6 developed depression ( Table S1 ).
To characterize the stability of the gut microbiome over time, we first investigated microbial composition and diversity. Compared to baseline, we observed a significant increase in the alpha-diversity (species-level Shannon index, P Paired Wilcoxon = 2.4 × 10 −7 , Figure 1 A), as well as a moderate variation in microbial species and pathway abundance (P PCo1 Paired Wilcoxon > 0.08 and P PCo2 Paired Wilcoxon < 1.6 × 10 −5 for both species and pathway, respectively, Figure S2 ). The differences in overall microbial species and pathway composition were larger between individuals than within individuals (P Wilcoxon < 1 × 10 −4 , Figures 1 B and 1C), indicating that an individual’s gut microbial composition is more similar to their own composition 4 years ago than to those of other people. Interestingly, within-individual differences in gut microbial species composition were smaller in participants with a higher baseline alpha-diversity (r Spearman = −0.21, p = 1.5 × 10 −4 , Figure 1 D), supporting the hypothesis that diverse microbial communities tend to be more stable ( Coyte et al., 2015 13. Coyte, K.Z. ∙ Schluter, J. ∙ Foster, K.R. The ecology of the microbiome: Networks, competition, and stability Science. 2015; 350 :663-666 Crossref Scopus (1479) PubMed Google Scholar ).
When comparing individual microbial species and pathways, the relative abundance of 59.9% species (94 out of 157) and 44.3% pathways (152 out of 343) showed a significant difference at FDR <0.05 (paired Wilcoxon test, Table S2 ). Species belonging to the same genera often showed consistent changes in direction, e.g., the relative abundance of 7 Bifidobacterium species all decreased significantly, while the abundances of the majority of Alistipes species (7 out of 8) increased ( Table S2 ). These changes may partially be due to an age effect. For instance, several Bifidobacterium species, including B. adolescentis , B. bifidum , and B. longum , have been observed to be negatively associated with age ( Zhernakova et al., 2016 67. Zhernakova, A. ∙ Kurilshikov, A. ∙ Bonder, M.J. ..., LifeLines cohort study Population-based metagenomics analysis reveals markers for gut microbiome composition and diversity Science. 2016; 352 :565-569 Crossref Scopus (1278) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Microbial genetic makeup may also change over time, e.g., due to mutagenesis and strain replacement. Characterization of the stable and changeable genetic components of the gut microbiome over a long time course is important for further understanding the importance of microbial strain alterations with respect to host phenotypic changes. Here, we characterized within-individual temporal microbial genetic differences by comparing both single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes ( Truong et al., 2017 52. Truong, D.T. ∙ Tett, A. ∙ Pasolli, E. ... Microbial strain-level population structure and genetic diversity from metagenomes Genome Res. 2017; 27 :626-638 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar ) and genomic structural variants (SVs) ( Zeevi et al., 2019 65. Zeevi, D. ∙ Korem, T. ∙ Godneva, A. ... Structural variation in the gut microbiome associates with host health Nature. 2019; 568 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). SNP haplotype differences were characterized for 37 species that were present in at least 5 paired samples from both time points ( Figure 2 A; Table S2 ). We also identified 6,130 SVs, including 4,333 deletion SVs (dSVs, absence of genomic regions) and 1,797 variable SVs (vSVs, genomic regions with variable coverage) from 41 microbial species present in at least 5 paired samples ( Figure 2 B; Table S2 ).
We observed that within-individual genetic differences in SNP haplotypes and SVs were significantly smaller than the differences between different individuals ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Table S2 ). The species that showed large temporal changes in their SNP haplotypes included Ruminococcus torques , Streptococcus parasanguinis , and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , while Bifidobacterium angulatum , Methanobrevibacter smithii , and Alistipes putredinis showed relatively low genetic variability (P Wilcoxon < 0.05, Figure 2 A). A consistent trend in the genetic stability of SNP profiles was also observed in 43 healthy participants with fecal microbiome data available 1 year apart from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) ( Figure 2 C) ( Schloissnig et al., 2013 45. Schloissnig, S. ∙ Arumugam, M. ∙ Sunagawa, S. ... Genomic variation landscape of the human gut microbiome Nature. 2013; 493 :45-50 Crossref Scopus (639) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to the HMP cohort, the genetic differences in unstable species were larger in the LLD cohort, potentially due to a longer duration of follow-up ( Figures 2 D–2F). This observation further supports the genetic instability of these species over time.
For 23 species, both strain SNP haplotype and SV information were available ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Temporal variability in SNP haplotypes and SVs showed substantial consistency ( Figures S3 A and S3B), illustrating that the microbial genetic stability of some species can be seen at different levels of genetic variation. For example, several species with highly time-dependent variability in SNP haplotypes, such as R. torques and F. prausnitzii , also showed a high degree of changes in their SVs, whereas other species, such as M. smithii , showed high stability of both SNP haplotypes and within-individual SV variability ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
Interestingly, these genetically unstable species have often been reported to be related to human health and disease. For instance, previous studies have found a higher abundance of R. torques in patients with Crohn disease ( Joossens et al., 2011 27. Joossens, M. ∙ Huys, G. ∙ Cnockaert, M. ... Dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with Crohn’s disease and their unaffected relatives Gut. 2011; 60 :631-637 Crossref Scopus (808) PubMed Google Scholar ), a higher level of S. parasanguinis in patients with intestinal infection ( Vacca, 2017 53. Vacca, I. Biofilms: New ways for streptococci to settle down Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 15 :321 Google Scholar ) and a lower level of F. prausnitzii in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( Munukka et al., 2017 38. Munukka, E. ∙ Rintala, A. ∙ Toivonen, R. ... Faecalibacterium prausnitzii treatment improves hepatic health and reduces adipose tissue inflammation in high-fat fed mice ISME J. 2017; 11 :1667-1679 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vich Vila et al., 2018 57. Vich Vila, A. ∙ Imhann, F. ∙ Collij, V. ... Gut microbiota composition and functional changes in inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaap8914 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, within-individual differences in microbial genetic makeup did not correlate with changes in abundance ( Figure S3 C), suggesting that microbial genetic variability provides an extra layer of information that is independent of microbial abundance. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the temporal changes in genetic makeup can be also driven by replacement of the dominant strain. Using SNP profiles, we observed distinct strains for five species, R. torques , F. prausnitzii , S. parasanguinis , Ruminococcus obeum , and Eubacterium rectale , that showed >70% genetic dissimilarity ( Figure S4 ).
Taken together, these results illustrate that within-individual differences in both microbial composition and genomes can be detected 4 years apart, but within-individual similarity of microbiome compositional and genetic profiles is greater than between-individual similarity. The stable and variable microbial compositional and genetic components we observe can have different implications: individually stable microbial components might be used to identify their host, whereas variable microbial components might be related to phenotypic changes of the host.
We observed that some species, such as M. smithii , showed large between-individual variability but small within-individual differences in their genetic makeup ( Figure 2 A). Per 100 base pairs (bp) of the species-specific regions, M. smithii had an average 0.11 bp difference between two samples from the same individual but an average 2.77 bp difference between different individuals (P Wilcoxon test = 3.6 × 10 −64 , Figure 2 A; Table S2 ). This inspired us to evaluate the possibility of using microbial genetic and compositional profiles to distinguish samples from the same individuals. We generated the SNP haplotype profiles of M. smithii for 100 paired samples. Based on the distance of the M. smithii SNP profiles, we could correctly link 94 paired samples, resulting in an accuracy of 94% (proportion of correctly distinguished sample pairs) ( Figure S5 ). We systematically assessed the fingerprinting potential of the 71 microbial profiles that were present in >10% of paired samples ( Table S3 ), including the composition of microbial species and metabolic pathways, SNP profiles in 18 species, vSV profiles in 25 species, and dSV profiles in 26 species. In total, 17 of these profiles had at least 50% accuracy in classifying samples. After M. smithii , the second-best classifier was the SNP profile of Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens , which classified 41 paired samples with 88% accuracy ( Figure S5 ; Table S3 ). However, sample classification based on microbial species and pathway composition resulted in only 12% and 5% accuracy, respectively ( Table S3 ). Our data imply that microbial genetic profiles dominate over microbial abundance in fingerprinting the human host.
SNP haplotype profiles like M. smithii could only be generated for 100 of the 338 paired samples, potentially due to microbial absence in the gut, which prohibits the use of the genetic profile of a single microbial profile as a host fingerprint. This limitation further inspired us to combine multiple microbial genetics and composition (both species and pathway abundances) for a broader application. We applied stepwise forward selection to optimize the combination of different profiles in a randomly selected 60% of individuals and validated the individual recognition abilities in the remaining 40% of individuals. The resampling and feature selection were repeated 10 times ( Figures S6 A and S6B). The combination of all 71 profiles ( Table S3 ) resulted in up to 85% classification accuracy ( Figure 3 A), with an optimal model combining the top 30 profiles yielding 82% classification accuracy ( Figure 3 B). This optimal model includes SNP profiles of 13 species, dSV profiles of 11 species, vSV profiles of 5 species, and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of species abundance ( Figure S6 C). We conducted specificity and sensitivity analyses for the sample classification. The total area under the curve (AUC) was 95% ( Figure 3 C), and we reached the optimal 99% specificity and 88% sensitivity at a distance cutoff of 0.46 ( Figure 3 D). At this cutoff, we could classify 298 paired samples with 93% accuracy.
We then tested our microbial fingerprinting method in the longitudinal sample collection of 43 individuals in the HMP cohort, our model resulted in 100% accuracy for 41 out of the 43 paired samples at a distance cutoff 0.46 ( Figure 3 B) and 95% accuracy in the total set of 43 pairs. This accuracy is higher than the previously reported 30% accuracy based on microbial species abundance and the 80% accuracy based on the microbial gene abundance ( Franzosa et al., 2015 19. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ Huang, K. ∙ Meadow, J.F. ... Identifying personal microbiomes using metagenomic codes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E2930-E2938 Crossref Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ). The HMP result confirms the robustness of our microbial fingerprinting method.
To examine the role of the gut microbiota in host health, we explored the associations between microbial compositional and genomic changes and host phenotypic changes. We performed two-step analyses to reveal microbial associations to host phenotypes using longitudinal data. First, we performed joint association analyses between microbial features and 51 host phenotypic factors that were highly prevalent between the two time points ( Table S1 ) using mixed models and including age, sex, and sampling time as covariates. Next, for associations identified at FDR <0.05, we conducted regression analysis on temporal differences, i.e., associations between microbial changes and host phenotypic changes over time (delta association). This identified 190 associations involving 169 microbial features and 34 phenotypes that were significant at FDR <0.05 in the joint association analysis and also significant at p < 0.05 for the delta association analysis with a consistent direction of effect. These included 84 associations with species and pathway abundances and 106 associations with microbial SVs ( Table S4 ). BMI, blood pressure, HbA1C, and depression were the phenotypic factors with the most associations ( Figure 4 A). For instance, we observed a positive association between systolic blood pressure and the abundance of Lachnospiraceae bacterium (beta delta = 0.24, P delta = 1.1 × 10 −5 , Figure 4 B) and a negative association between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the flavin biosynthesis pathway (PWY-6168, beta delta = −0.22, P delta = 4.9 × 10 −5 , Figure 4 C). In addition, temporal changes in microbial SVs were associated with host immune phenotypes. For instance, a vSV (3,019–3,020 kb) in Blautia obeum that contains virulence protein E and chloramphenicol resistance genes was negatively associated with a change in blood lymphocyte cell counts (beta delta = −0.29, P delta = 6.5 × 10 −4 , Figure 4 D). For disease onset, we detected 22 associations, namely, 15 associations for depression, 3 associations for IBS, and 3 for asthma. The top association for depression onset was found for a dSV region (from 1,164 to 1,165 kb) in Collinsella sp. that encodes the histidine kinase A (P Fisher exact test = 3.0 × 10 −3 , Figure 4 E).
To further understand the potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota could drive host pathophysiology, we hypothesized that metabolites are an important class of molecules that are involved in the host-microbe interaction. By profiling plasma levels of 1,183 metabolites at both time points using untargeted LC-MS, we observed that 27% of metabolites showed significant differences between the two time points at FDR <0.05 (paired Wilcoxon, Table S2 ).
We then looked for metabolic changes specifically in relation to strain replacement and alterations in microbial abundances and SVs. We first checked whether plasma metabolites showed differences in participants with distinct microbial strains ( Figure S5 ) and, if so, whether strain replacement of these species was related to changes in plasma metabolites. In total, we observed 64 significant associations between 63 metabolites and strain clusters of 5 species ( Table S4 ). For example, in 292 paired samples, we identified 2 distinct strain clusters of F. prausnitzii ( Figure 5 A) that associated with 15 metabolites ( Table S4 ). The top associations were observed for licorisoflavan A, pyrrole, and p-cresol sulfate, and the levels of these metabolites were significantly lower in individuals with F. prausnitzii strain 2 (FDR < 0.05). We also consistently observed that the abundance of these metabolites decreased in the 24 individuals where F. prausnitzii shifted from strain 1 to 2, whereas the metabolite levels increased in the 13 individuals where F. prausnitzii shifted from strain 2 to 1 ( Figures 5 B–5E). These results suggest that different microbial strains may have different functions that potentially influence host metabolism.
We also detected 455 significant associations between 122 microbial features (species and pathway abundances, dSVs and vSVs) and 81 metabolites (FDR joint < 0.05 and P delta < 0.05, Figure 6 A, Table S4 ), including 273 associations with microbial abundance and 182 associations with microbial SVs. Interestingly, various metabolites that associated with the microbiome are already known to be related to the gut microbiome. For instance, we detected 38 microbial associations to plasma levels of thiamine, a vitamin (B1) produced by gut microbes. Thiamine deficiency can affect the cardiovascular system and induce a fast heart rate ( DiNicolantonio et al., 2013 14. DiNicolantonio, J.J. ∙ Niazi, A.K. ∙ Lavie, C.J. ... Thiamine supplementation for the treatment of heart failure: a review of the literature Congest. Heart Fail. 2013; 19 :214-222 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). The top microbial associations to thiamine included the species Alistipes senegalensis (beta delta = 0.20, P delta = 4.1 × 10 −4 , Figure 6 B) and Bacteroidales bacterium (beta delta = 0.23, P delta = 5.2 × 10 −5 ) and the TCA cycle pathway (beta delta = 0.23, P delta = 7.2 × 10 −5 ) ( Table S4 ). Notably, the genome of Alistipes senegalensis contains genes responsible for thiamine biosynthesis ( Mishra et al., 2012 37. Mishra, A.K. ∙ Gimenez, G. ∙ Lagier, J.C. ... Genome sequence and description of Alistipes senegalensis sp. nov Stand. Genomic Sci. 2012; 6 :1-16 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Another interesting category of metabolites are protein-bound uremic toxins, which are related to microbial metabolism of amino acids and have been associated with various chronic diseases ( Wang and Zhao, 2018 59. Wang, Z. ∙ Zhao, Y. Gut microbiota derived metabolites in cardiovascular health and disease Protein Cell. 2018; 9 :416-431 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ). We characterized plasma levels of 58 uremic toxins from metabolite categories of indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol sulfate, phenyl sulfate, phenylacetic acid, and hippuric acid ( Wang and Zhao, 2018 59. Wang, Z. ∙ Zhao, Y. Gut microbiota derived metabolites in cardiovascular health and disease Protein Cell. 2018; 9 :416-431 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ) and observed a significant enrichment for microbial associations: 97 associations for 16 uremic toxins (P Fisher’s exact test = 1.7 × 10 −21 ) ( Figure 6 A; Table S4 ). The most-associated uremic toxins included p-cresol (24 associations), p-cresol sulfate (20 associations), and hippuric acid (16 associations) ( Table S4 ). P-cresol sulfate is a microbiota-derived metabolite that contributes to many biological and biochemical effects, such as albuminuria in diabetic kidney disease ( Kikuchi et al., 2019 29. Kikuchi, K. ∙ Saigusa, D. ∙ Kanemitsu, Y. ... Gut microbiome-derived phenyl sulfate contributes to albuminuria in diabetic kidney disease Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1835 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). The top association to p-cresol sulfate was with Bacteroidales bacterium ph8 (beta delta = 0.21, P delta = 1.9 × 10 −4 , Figure 6 C), a gut microbial species about which little is currently known. Notably, 22.6% (103 out of 455) of the microbial associations with metabolites were related to vSVs of Blautia wexlerae ( Figure 6 A). Among these, 27 associations were related to different uremic toxins, particularly to hippuric acid ( Figure 6 D), an acyl glycine formed from the conjugation of benzoic acid with glycine and associated with phenylketonuria, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia ( Duranton et al., 2012 15. Duranton, F. ∙ Cohen, G. ∙ De Smet, R. ..., European Uremic Toxin Work Group Normal and pathologic concentrations of uremic toxins J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2012; 23 :1258-1270 Crossref Scopus (767) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, these vSV regions encode various membranes transporters, amino acid kinases, urease accessory protein, and protein-binding genes ( Table S4 ).
Of the 169 microbial features associated with clinical phenotypes and the 122 associated with metabolites, 29 microbial features are associated with both ( Figure 7 A). To evaluate whether metabolites can mediate the microbial impact on host phenotypes, we applied bi-directional mediation analysis, which revealed 21 mediation linkages (FDR mediation < 0.05 and P inverse mediation > 0.05, Figure 7 B; Table S4 ). Most of these linkages were related to microbial impact on blood pressure via thiamine (9 linkages) and acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine (AFMK, 9 linkages). The impact of thiamine on cardiometabolic health has been well documented and was confirmed in a randomized controlled trial that showed that thiamine can reduce diastolic blood pressure ( Alaei-Shahmiri et al., 2015 3. Alaei-Shahmiri, F. ∙ Soares, M.J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ... The impact of thiamine supplementation on blood pressure, serum lipids and C-reactive protein in individuals with hyperglycemia: a randomised, double-blind cross-over trial Diabetes Metab. Syndr. 2015; 9 :213-217 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). AFMK is a degradation metabolite of melatonin that contributes to blood pressure reduction by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandin ( Mayo et al., 2005 34. Mayo, J.C. ∙ Sainz, R.M. ∙ Tan, D.X. ... Anti-inflammatory actions of melatonin and its metabolites, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK), in macrophages J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 165 :139-149 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rezzani et al., 2010 41. Rezzani, R. ∙ Porteri, E. ∙ De Ciuceis, C. ... Effects of melatonin and Pycnogenol on small artery structure and function in spontaneously hypertensive rats Hypertension. 2010; 55 :1373-1380 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our mediation analysis suggested that various bacterial pathways may contribute to these effects. For instance, the microbial sulfate reduction pathway may contribute to a decrease in diastolic blood pressure by increasing plasma thiamine levels (21%, P mediation = 6.0 × 10 −3 , Figure 7 C), and bacterial lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis may contribute to a decrease in systolic blood pressure by affecting plasma levels of AFMK (16%, P mediation = 6.0 × 10 −3 , Figure 7 D). Metabolic products of the bacterial sulfate reduction pathway, such as cysteine, are essential for bacterial thiamine (vitamin B1) biosynthesis ( Begley, 1996 6. Begley, T.P. The biosynthesis and degradation of thiamin (vitamin B1) Nat. Prod. Rep. 1996; 13 :177-185 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), and lipopolysaccharides can activate melatonin oxidation to produce AFMK ( Silva et al., 2004 47. Silva, S.O. ∙ Rodrigues, M.R. ∙ Carvalho, S.R. ... Oxidation of melatonin and its catabolites, N1-acetyl-N2 -formyl-5-methoxykynuramine and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine, by activated leukocytes J. Pineal Res. 2004; 37 :171-175 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also identified several metabolite mediation effects in the microbial impact on plasma lipids and glucose levels ( Figure 7 B). An interesting example here is tyrosol 4-sulfate, a uremic toxin that mediates the effect of a vSV in Ruminococcus sp. (300–305 kb) on plasma levels of LDL (17%, P mediation = 0.017, Figure 7 E). This vSV contains an ATPase that is responsible for transmembrane transport of metabolites ( Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2011 1. Aguilar-Barajas, E. ∙ Díaz-Pérez, C. ∙ Ramírez-Díaz, M.I. ... Bacterial transport of sulfate, molybdate, and related oxyanions Biometals. 2011; 24 :687-707 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The increase of antibiotic resistance can pose a great burden in fighting infectious diseases, while virulence factors are essential for the commensal microbiota to maintain their colonization niche and evade the host’s immune response. We further systematically characterized and compared the abundances of 29 antibiotic resistance genes and 59 virulence genes over time. We observed a significant increase in the total antibiotic resistance gene load (p = 1.1 × 10 −9 ) and a decrease in the total number of virulence genes (p = 5.1 × 10 −4 ) ( Figures S7 A and S7B). At the individual-gene level, 55.2% (16 out of 29) of antibiotic resistance genes and 18.6% (11 out of 59) of virulence genes showed a significant difference (FDR <0.05) between time points ( Table S2 ). Specifically, 15 out of 16 antibiotic resistance genes showed an increase in their abundance, with the highest change observed for tetracycline resistance genes ( Table S2 ) such as tetracycline resistance protein Q (TetQ), which is widely distributed in Bacteroides species ( Veloo et al., 2019 56. Veloo, A.C.M. ∙ Baas, W.H. ∙ Haan, F.J. ... Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes in Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. Dutch clinical isolates Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2019; 25 :1156.e9 1156 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) Google Scholar ). In line with this, the increase of tetracycline resistance gene abundance was associated with the increased abundance of multiple Bacteroides species (e.g., B. vulgatus , B. uniformis , and B. ovatus , Figure S7 C; Table S4 ) whose abundance also increased in the follow-up ( Table S2 ).
Although antibiotic prescription in the Netherlands remains the lowest in the Europe, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and lincosamide are among the top broad-spectrum veterinary antibiotics ( Havelaar et al., 2017 25. Havelaar, A.H. ∙ Graveland, H. ∙ van de Kassteele, J. ... A summary index for antimicrobial resistance in food animals in the Netherlands BMC Vet. Res. 2017; 13 :305 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may contribute to increased microbial antibiotic resistance in humans ( Aslam et al., 2018 4. Aslam, B. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Arshad, M.I. ... Antibiotic resistance: a rundown of a global crisis Infect. Drug Resist. 2018; 11 :1645-1658 Crossref Scopus (1607) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore examined the correlation of baseline meat intake with the changes in the abundance of microbial antibiotic resistance genes and found positive associations with aminoglycoside resistance (r Spearman = 0.18, p = 9.2 × 10 −4 ) and lincosamide resistance (r Spearman = 0.15, p = 5.5 × 10 −3 ) ( Figures S7 D and S7E; Table S4 ). These observations raise concerns about antibiotic usage in farming, which may be contributing to the spread of microbial antibiotic resistance in the human gut ecosystem.

Section: Discussion

Over the past years, numerous associations between a disrupted microbiota and diseases, for example, gastrointestinal and cardiometabolic diseases, have been observed in large cross-sectional studies ( Chen et al., 2020a 11.

Vieira-Silva, S. ∙ Falony, G. ∙ Belda, E. ..., MetaCardis Consortium Statin therapy is associated with lower prevalence of gut microbiota dysbiosis Nature. 2020; 581 :310-315 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhernakova et al., 2016 67. Zhernakova, A. ∙ Kurilshikov, A. ∙ Bonder, M.J. ..., LifeLines cohort study Population-based metagenomics analysis reveals markers for gut microbiome composition and diversity Science. 2016; 352 :565-569 Crossref Scopus (1278) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the key to understanding the role of a disrupted microbiota in human diseases is to answer how stable the microbiota is and whether within-individual microbial differences can be linked to changes in host health status. We therefore systematically characterized the microbial changes at both compositional and genomic level at two time points 4 years apart in 338 individuals from the Lifelines-DEEP cohort. We observed that the gut microbiome showed a degree of long-term within-individual stability in both microbial abundance and microbial genome. In particular, we found that the genetic makeup of microbes shows individuality that can be used as a fingerprint to distinguish metagenomic samples belonging to the same individual. In addition, the longitudinal association analysis between changes in gut microbiome and host phenotypes and plasma metabolites revealed in silico causal relationships and putative mechanistic insights into the importance of the gut microbiome in human health and disease onset (depression, IBS, and asthma). Finally, we observed a significant increase in antibiotic resistance in the gut microbiome between the two time points that cannot be explained by self-reported antibiotic intake. Our study provides evidence that antibiotic exposure via meat consumption may result in an increase in the antibiotic resistance genes in the human gut microbiome.
Previous investigations on the short-term (within 1 year) temporal stability of microbial composition and genetic makeup in adults revealed that metagenomic samples obtained from the same individual are more similar to one another than to those from different individuals ( Garud et al., 2019 23. Garud, N.R. ∙ Good, B.H. ∙ Hallatschek, O. ... Evolutionary dynamics of bacteria in the gut microbiome within and across hosts PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000102 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mehta et al., 2018 35. Mehta, R.S. ∙ Abu-Ali, G.S. ∙ Drew, D.A. ... Stability of the human faecal microbiome in a cohort of adult men Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3 :347-355 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our large-scale characterization of the longer-term (4-year) stability of the gut microbiome extends this observation. In addition, we found that within-individual differences in gut microbial composition were smaller in participants who had a higher alpha-diversity at baseline, supporting the hypothesis that microbial communities with higher diversity tend to be more stable over time ( Coyte et al., 2015 13. Coyte, K.Z. ∙ Schluter, J. ∙ Foster, K.R. The ecology of the microbiome: Networks, competition, and stability Science. 2015; 350 :663-666 Crossref Scopus (1479) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also observed that the genetic stability of gut microbes varies substantially across different species, and a set of species from (but not limited to) the genera Bacteroides , Bifidobacterium , Methanobrevibacter , and Phascolarctobacterium showed relatively high within-individual stability over a long period of time. Notably, previous studies showed that some of these species, e.g., Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium , are colonized in early life ( Yassour et al., 2018 62. Yassour, M. ∙ Jason, E. ∙ Hogstrom, L.J. ... Strain-Level Analysis of Mother-to-Child Bacterial Transmission during the First Few Months of Life Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :146-154 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ) and show high genetic stability in childhood ( Vatanen et al., 2019 55. Vatanen, T. ∙ Plichta, D.R. ∙ Somani, J. ... Genomic variation and strain-specific functional adaptation in the human gut microbiome during early life Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :470-479 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data suggest that each person is likely to have individual-specific microbial genetic components that are distinct from those of others and may persist from childhood to adulthood. The gut microbial genetic profile can therefore serve as a host fingerprint to uniquely distinguish stool samples belonging to the same host. In this study, we constructed a microbial fingerprinting model that combines 30 microbial features, including microbial composition, SNP profiles of 13 species, and SVs of 16 species. This model showed 82% accuracy when identifying Lifelines-DEEP samples taken 4 years apart and 95% accuracy when identifying HMP samples taken 1 year apart. These results demonstrate a potential application of our method in distinguishing sample mix-ups but also raise potential privacy concerns for subjects enrolled in human microbiome research projects.
Characterization of the long-term changes in the gut microbiome is crucial for understanding the role of the gut microbiome in chronic diseases, which have long duration and generally slow progression. Differential microbial abundances have been characterized for around half of microbial species and pathways, and within-individual differences in microbial genetic makeup have also been observed. Interestingly, the bacterial SNP haplotype and SV changes in our study did not associate with abundance changes, which reveals an extra layer of information about the microbiome’s contribution to host health that is independent of abundance alterations. In contrast to previous studies that only focused on associations of microbial abundances to host phenotypes ( Lloyd-Price et al., 2019 33. Lloyd-Price, J. ∙ Arze, C. ∙ Ananthakrishnan, A.N. ..., IBDMDB Investigators Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases Nature. 2019; 569 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (1557) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vatanen et al., 2018 54.

Longitudinal multi-omics of host-microbe dynamics in prediabetes Nature. 2019; 569 :663-671 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ), microbial genetic associations that connect genomic variations with genetically encoded functions to phenotypic changes can provide putative mechanistic information. We noted that increased or decreased abundances of the species that we observed to be genetically unstable ( R. torques , S. parasanguinis , and F. prausnitzii ) have also been associated with various human diseases ( Joossens et al., 2011 27. Joossens, M. ∙ Huys, G. ∙ Cnockaert, M. ...

Zhernakova, A. ∙ Kurilshikov, A. ∙ Bonder, M.J. ..., LifeLines cohort study Population-based metagenomics analysis reveals markers for gut microbiome composition and diversity Science. 2016; 352 :565-569 Crossref Scopus (1278) PubMed Google Scholar ). F. prausnitzii has been shown to support mucosal immune homeostasis ( Hornef and Pabst, 2016 26. Hornef, M.W. ∙ Pabst, O. Real friends: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii supports mucosal immune homeostasis Gut. 2016; 65 :365-367 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), mostly linked to its capacity for butyrate production ( Miquel et al., 2013 36. Miquel, S. ∙ Martín, R. ∙ Rossi, O. ... Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and human intestinal health Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16 :255-261 Crossref Scopus (790) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our data show that a greater increase in a vSV of F. prausnitzii (1,962–1,966 kb, Table S4 ) was associated with a lower increase in the number of leucocyte cells, and this SV region encodes multiple riboflavin biosynthesis genes. Interestingly, we also observed F. prausnitzii strain replacement in 37 individuals and established many associations with plasma metabolites that affect host immunity, including with licorisoflavan A and p-cresol sulfate from the class of isoflavonoids and uremic toxins. Taken together, our data suggest mechanisms underlie the role of F. prausnitzii in host immunity.
Notably, metabolite associations to the gut microbiome were significantly enriched for uremic toxins and thiamine. Gut microbiota derive uremic toxins from dietary protein, and the accumulation of uremic toxins can induce chronic sterile inflammation, which in turn increases the risks of kidney and cardiometabolic diseases ( Solomon et al., 2010 48. Solomon, S.D. ∙ Uno, H. ∙ Lewis, E.F. ..., Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) Investigators Erythropoietic response and outcomes in kidney disease and type 2 diabetes N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363 :1146-1155 Crossref Scopus (414) PubMed Google Scholar ). We characterized 58 protein-binding uremic toxins and detected 97 microbial associations for 16 uremic toxins. One of the most-associated uremic toxins is hippuric acid, a cardiometabolic risk-related metabolite that can significantly contribute to the prediction of weight gain ( Yu et al., 2018 63. Yu, T.-H. ∙ Tang, W.-H. ∙ Lu, Y.-C. ... Association between hippuric acid and left ventricular hypertrophy in maintenance hemodialysis patients Clin. Chim. Acta. 2018; 484 :47-51 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2016 66. Zhao, H. ∙ Shen, J. ∙ Djukovic, D. ... Metabolomics-identified metabolites associated with body mass index and prospective weight gain among Mexican American women Obes. Sci. Pract. 2016; 2 :309-317 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed several microbial associations with hippuric acid, such as associations between B. wexlerae SVs and hippuric acid. These B. wexlerae SVs were also associated with BMI, suggesting that B. wexlerae may contribute to metabolic disorder, potentially through hippuric acid metabolism.
Vitamin B1 production is dependent on the gut microbiome, and B1 deficiency can impact the cardiovascular system ( DiNicolantonio et al., 2013 14. DiNicolantonio, J.J. ∙ Niazi, A.K. ∙ Lavie, C.J. ... Thiamine supplementation for the treatment of heart failure: a review of the literature Congest. Heart Fail. 2013; 19 :214-222 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the microbial associations to vitamin B1, our top association was related to the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila , a well-known beneficial microbe that controls gut barrier function and homeostatic functions ( Everard et al., 2013 16. Everard, A. ∙ Belzer, C. ∙ Geurts, L. ... Cross-talk between Akkermansia muciniphila and intestinal epithelium controls diet-induced obesity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :9066-9071 Crossref Scopus (3353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our mediation analysis identified 21 relationships, suggesting that metabolites can mediate the microbial impact on host phenotype, particularly for cardiometabolic traits. With this analysis, we further revealed that A. muciniphila may influence blood pressure through vitamin B1 production, providing a rationale for the development of treatment that uses this human mucus colonizer for the prevention of hypertension. Altogether, our longitudinal microbial associations and mediation analyses on host phenotypes and plasma metabolites reveal functional insights and putative causality for the role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease onset.
We acknowledge several limitations in our study. The study sampled fecal samples 4 years apart in 338 individuals, making it the longest duration metagenomic sequencing-based longitudinal microbiome study with the largest sample size to date. We systematically investigated the compositional and genetic variation over time and linked microbial changes to phenotypic changes. We observed that a gut microbial composition with higher baseline diversity is more stable over time. The same finding was observed in a recent longitudinal study that followed the gut microbiome in 1,282 individuals for 5 years using 16 s rRNA sequencing ( Frost et al., 2020 21. Frost, F. ∙ Kacprowski, T. ∙ Rühlemann, M. ... Long-term instability of the intestinal microbiome is associated with metabolic liver disease, low microbiota diversity, diabetes mellitus and impaired exocrine pancreatic function Gut. 2020; 70 :522-530 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Replication in independent cohorts with longer duration and larger sample size may further strength this observation and underline biological significance. The Lifelines-DEEP cohort comprises Dutch participants of Caucasian ethnicity from the northern region of the Netherlands. It is thus possible that Lifelines-DEEP results are biased toward a region-specific microbial background constrained by host genetics and local environmental exposures. We further validated the performance of our microbial fingerprinting model in the HMP cohort that was dominated by Caucasians living in the US. It would be interesting to see whether the model performs equally well for cohorts with more diverse or other specific ethnic backgrounds. Furthermore, longitudinal associations are not proof of causation, although we did carry out causal mediation analysis to infer in silico causality. We primarily focused on biologically plausible mechanisms by integrating the longitudinal metabolism dataset in order to provide mechanistic hypotheses that pinpoint specific microbial genetics and function but also demonstrate which metabolites are likely to mediate the impact of the gut microbiome on the host phenotype. Experimental validation is thus needed.

Wijmenga, C. ∙ Zhernakova, A. The importance of cohort studies in the post-GWAS era Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :322-328 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). The study has been approved by the institutional ethics review board of the University Medical Center Groningen (ref. M12.113965). This cohort has now been followed-up, with detailed phenotypic data collected at two time points around four years apart. Of the 1,135 individuals for whom we generated metagenomics sequencing data in 2013 ( Zhernakova et al., 2016 67. Zhernakova, A. ∙ Kurilshikov, A. ∙ Bonder, M.J. ..., LifeLines cohort study Population-based metagenomics analysis reveals markers for gut microbiome composition and diversity Science. 2016; 352 :565-569 Crossref Scopus (1278) PubMed Google Scholar ), follow-up stool samples were collected for 338 individuals (55.6% female and 44.4% male) at the second time point. The duration between the two time points ranged from 3.33 to 3.92 years (mean = 3.53, sd = 0.12). At baseline, the mean age of participants was 48.2 years (18‒80, sd = 11.7) and their mean BMI was 25.4 (17.6-‒43.3, sd = 4.08). At follow-up, the mean age was 51.7 years (22‒84, sd = 11.7) and the mean BMI was 25.6 (16.1‒37.6, sd = 4.0). Phenotypic data assessed in the present study included anthropometric traits (e.g., age, gender, BMI, height), 9 blood cell counts, 7 plasma metabolites (e.g., glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides), 12 diseases (IBS, depression, arthrosis) and 14 medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, oral contraceptives, beta blockers, statins).
Stool sample collection and processing followed the same protocol at both time points. All participants were asked to collect fecal samples at home and place them in their home freezer (−20°C) within 15 minutes after production. Subsequently, a nurse visited the participant to pick up the fecal samples on dry ice and transfer them to the laboratory. Aliquots were then made and stored at −80°C until further processing. The same protocol for fecal DNA isolation and metagenomics sequencing was used at both time points. Fecal DNA isolation was performed using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN; cat. 80204). After DNA extraction, fecal DNA was sent to the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, where library preparation and whole genome shotgun sequencing were performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform. From the raw metagenomics sequencing data, low-quality reads were discarded by the sequencing facility and reads belonging to the human genome were removed by mapping the data to the human reference genome (version NCBI37) with KneadData (version 0.4.6.1) Bowtie2 (version 2.1.0) ( Langmead et al., 2019 30. Langmead, B. ∙ Wilks, C. ∙ Antonescu, V. ... Scaling read aligners to hundreds of threads on general-purpose processors Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :421-432 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). After filtering, the average read depth was 12.3 million for both baseline samples and follow-up samples. The read depths of all samples at both time points were identical (paired Wilcoxon test p = 0.89).
Microbial taxonomic profiles were generated using MetaPhlAn2 (version 2.7.2) ( Truong et al., 2015 51. Truong, D.T. ∙ Franzosa, E.A. ∙ Tickle, T.L. ... MetaPhlAn2 for enhanced metagenomic taxonomic profiling Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :902-903 Crossref Scopus (1403) PubMed Google Scholar ). MetaPhlAn2 relies on nearly 1 million unique clade-specific marker genes identified from around 17,000 reference genomes (13,500 bacterial and archaeal, 3,500 viral and 110 eukaryotic), allowing unambiguous taxonomic assignments, accurate estimation of organismal relative abundance and species-level resolution for bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and viruses. Microbial species present in more than 10% of the samples were included for further analyses. This yielded a list of 157 species that account for 97.81% of the taxonomic composition.
Microbial functional profiles were determined using HUMAnN2 (version 0.10.0) ( Franzosa et al., 2018 20. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Rahnavard, G. ... Species-level functional profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :962-968 Crossref Scopus (952) PubMed Google Scholar ), which maps DNA/RNA reads to a customized database of functionally annotated pan-genomes. HUMAnN2 reported the abundances of gene families from the UniProt Reference Clusters ( Bateman et al., 2015 5. Bateman, A. ∙ Martin, M.J. ∙ O’Donovan, C. ..., UniProt Consortium UniProt: a hub for protein information Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D204-D212 Crossref Scopus (3882) PubMed Google Scholar ) (UniRef90), which were further mapped to microbial pathways from the MetaCyc metabolic pathway database ( Caspi et al., 2016 8. Caspi, R. ∙ Billington, R. ∙ Ferrer, L. ... The MetaCyc database of metabolic pathways and enzymes and the BioCyc collection of pathway/genome databases Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D471-D480 Crossref Scopus (808) PubMed Google Scholar ; Caspi et al., 2018 9. Caspi, R. ∙ Billington, R. ∙ Fulcher, C.A. ... The MetaCyc database of metabolic pathways and enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D633-D639 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on MetaPhlAn2, HUMAnN2 can further characterize community functional profiles stratified by known (species-level) and unclassified organisms. In total, 343 microbial pathways present in more than 10% of the samples were kept for subsequent analysis, accounting for 99.98% of microbial functional composition.
Quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in metagenomics was performed using shortBRED (version 0.9.5) ( Kaminski et al., 2015 28. Kaminski, J. ∙ Gibson, M.K. ∙ Franzosa, E.A. ... High-Specificity Targeted Functional Profiling in Microbial Communities with ShortBRED PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004557 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ) with markers generated from the ResFinder database, which reports more than 1,800 different antimicrobial resistance genes (November 2018 version) ( Zankari et al., 2012 64. Zankari, E. ∙ Hasman, H. ∙ Cosentino, S. ... Identification of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2012; 67 :2640-2644 Crossref Scopus (3713) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, ShortBRED is a pipeline to take a set of protein sequences from a target database (i.e., ResFinder), cluster them into families, build consensus sequences to represent the families, and then reduce these consensus sequences to a set of unique identifying strings (markers). The pipeline then searches for these markers in metagenomic data and determines the presence and abundance of the protein families of interest. We classified the abundance of 29 antibiotic resistance genes that were present in at least 10% of the samples.
We also searched the metagenomic data for bacterial virulence genes using shortBRED (version 0.9.5) ( Kaminski et al., 2015 28. Kaminski, J. ∙ Gibson, M.K. ∙ Franzosa, E.A. ... High-Specificity Targeted Functional Profiling in Microbial Communities with ShortBRED PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004557 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ) and markers generated from virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria database (VFDB, core dataset of DNA sequences, version: November, 2018) ( Liu et al., 2019 31. Liu, B. ∙ Zheng, D. ∙ Jin, Q. ... VFDB 2019: a comparative pathogenomic platform with an interactive web interface Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D687-D692 Crossref Scopus (1149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we classified the abundance of 59 virulence genes that are present in at least 10% of the samples.
Strain SNP haplotypes were generated using StrainPhlAn1 (version 1.2.0) ( Truong et al., 2017 52. Truong, D.T. ∙ Tett, A. ∙ Pasolli, E. ... Microbial strain-level population structure and genetic diversity from metagenomes Genome Res. 2017; 27 :626-638 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar ). This method is based on reconstructing consensus sequence variants within species-specific marker genes and using them to estimate strain-level phylogenies. Reconstructed markers with a percentage of ambiguous bases > 20% are discarded. Consensus sequences are then trimmed by removing the first and last 50 bases because the terminal positions have lower coverage due to the limitations in mapping reads against truncated sequences ( Truong et al., 2017 52. Truong, D.T. ∙ Tett, A. ∙ Pasolli, E. ... Microbial strain-level population structure and genetic diversity from metagenomes Genome Res. 2017; 27 :626-638 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, clades with a percentage of markers < 50% are removed, and if the percentage of samples in which a marker is present is < 50%, that marker is also removed. Samples with full sequences concatenated from all markers and a percentage of gaps > 50% are removed from the alignment. Finally, we used the multiple sequence alignment file to generate a phylogenetic distance matrix that contains the pairwise nucleotide substitution rate between strains by applying the Kimura 2-parameter method from the EMBOSS package ( Rice et al., 2000 42. Rice, P. ∙ Longden, I. ∙ Bleasby, A. EMBOSS: the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite Trends Genet. 2000; 16 :276-277 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7029) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using this method, we classified the within-individual SNP haplotype difference of the dominant strain in 37 species that present in at least 5 sample pairs, and 18 of these were obtained in at least 10% of sample pairs. To identify distinct strain clusters within species, the SNP haplotype distance matrix was normalized by dividing maximal distance and hierarchical clustering was based on the complete method from R basic function hcluster() . Strain clusters were defined at a tree height of 0.7 (70% dissimilarity).
We applied the SGV-Finder pipeline ( Zeevi et al., 2019 65. Zeevi, D. ∙ Korem, T. ∙ Godneva, A. ... Structural variation in the gut microbiome associates with host health Nature. 2019; 568 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ) to classify SVs that are either completely absent in the microbial genome of some samples (deletion SVs, dSVs) or those whose coverage is highly variable across samples (variable SVs, vSVs). Prior to SV classification, an ‘iterative coverage-based read assignment’ algorithm was applied that resolves ambiguous read assignments to regions that are similar between different bacteria, using information on bacterial relative abundances in the microbiome, their genomic sequencing coverage and sequencing and alignment qualities ( Zeevi et al., 2019 65. Zeevi, D. ∙ Korem, T. ∙ Godneva, A. ... Structural variation in the gut microbiome associates with host health Nature. 2019; 568 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). In total, we classified 6,130 SVs, including 4,333 dSVs and 1,797 vSVs from 41 microbial species that are present in at least 5 sample pairs. The SVs of 26 species could be obtained in at least 10% of sample pairs. We further calculated Canberra distance between individuals based on the dSVs and vSVs of each microbial species, respectively.
Plasma samples were collected and frozen at −80°C with EDTA. During extraction, plasma samples were thawed on ice, vortexed and spun down. 20μL of plasma was combined with 180μL of 80% methanol and vortexed for 15 s. Samples were incubated at 4°C for one hour to precipitate proteins and then spun for 30 minutes at 3,200 R CF. 100μL of supernatant was removed and used for Flow-Injection Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (FIA-TOF) analysis at General Metabolics, Inc., Boston, USA, using protocols described previously ( Fuhrer et al., 2011 22. Fuhrer, T. ∙ Heer, D. ∙ Begemann, B. ... High-throughput, accurate mass metabolome profiling of cellular extracts by flow injection-time-of-flight mass spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2011; 83 :7074-7080 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). In total, 1,183 metabolites with annotations were involved in the analysis. The annotated metabolites cover 18 chemical categories based on the Human Metabolome Database ( Table S2 ) ( Wishart et al., 2018 61. Wishart, D.S. ∙ Feunang, Y.D. ∙ Marcu, A. ... HMDB 4.0: the human metabolome database for 2018 Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D608-D617 Crossref Scopus (2571) PubMed Google Scholar ). The characterization of plasma protein–bound uremic toxins, including indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, phenyl sulfate, phenylacetic acid and hippuric acid was based on ( Wang and Zhao, 2018 59. Wang, Z. ∙ Zhao, Y. Gut microbiota derived metabolites in cardiovascular health and disease Protein Cell. 2018; 9 :416-431 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The relative abundances of all microbial species and pathways were included in PCoA. We applied the vegdist() function from the vegan (version 2.5.5) R package to calculate the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix based on the composition at the species level. Subsequently, classical metric multidimensional scaling was carried out based on the Bray-Curtis distance matrix to obtain different principal coordinates.
To compare the differences in overall microbial species and pathway compositions between- and within-individuals, we applied a Wilcoxon test on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Since the number of dissimilarities between- and within-individuals was unbalanced, we calculated an empiric P value by permuting samples of microbial species and pathway relative abundance tables for 10,000 times.
We applied different transformation/normalization methods for the different microbial abundance datasets, depending on the type of dataset. Centered log-ratio transformation was applied to compositional data, such as the relative abundances (sum up to 1) of microbial species and functional pathways ( Aitchison, 1982 2. Aitchison, J. The statistical analysis of compositional data J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1982; 44 :139-160 Crossref Google Scholar ), and log transformation (with a pseudo count of 1 for zero values) was applied to read count data, such as the read counts of microbial antibiotic resistance genes and virulence gene (reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped, RPKMs). Within-individual differences in microbial abundance were then assessed by using paired Wilcoxon tests. The FDR was calculated with 1,000 times permutation.
We evaluated if microbial abundance and genome information can be used for individual classification (i.e., to identify if two samples belong to the same individual). To do so, we generated Bray-Curtis distances based on microbial species and pathway relative abundance, Kimura distance based on SNP haplotype profile and Canberra distance based on SV profiles. The samples were clustered using single-linkage clustering, also known as nearest neighbor clustering. If two samples, and only those two samples, from the same individual were clustered together as the closest neighbor, we considered that they were classified correctly. We then defined the accuracy by calculating the proportion of the total number of correctly classified pairs. Finally, by establishing a specific cutoff, we could determine whether a pair of samples came from the same individual by their dissimilarity, and the cutoff affects the performance of classifier. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was drawn based on dissimilarity to reflect the specificity and sensitivity of classification using roc() function from pROC (version 1.16.1) ( Robin et al., 2011 43. Robin, X. ∙ Turck, N. ∙ Hainard, A. ... pROC: an open-source package for R and S+ to analyze and compare ROC curves BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :77 Crossref Scopus (8001) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A total of 71 distance matrices were present in more than 10% of sample pairs, including 69 genetic distance matrices (SNP haplotype distance matrices for 18 species, dSV and vSV distance matrices for 26 species) and 2 compositional distance matrices generated by microbial species and pathways abundance. We aimed to see whether we can utilize these genetic and microbial distance matrices to classify different samples from the same individuals. Each of these distance matrices was considered as one classifier. We carried out a stepwise forward selection approach to combine multiple microbial genetic and compositional distance matrices. The cohort was randomly divided into a discovery set made up of 60% of sample pairs and a validation set with the remaining 40% of pairs. In order to combine multiple distance matrices, we first standardized and scaled all distance matrices between 0 and 1 by dividing each matrix by its largest value. In the discovery set, we assessed the accuracy of each distance matrix in classifying samples, as described above. We started with the distance matrix that had the highest accuracy, i.e., the 1 st classifier. We then moved on to the model with two distance matrices by adding another distance matrix and taking the mean value of two matrices. We tested all possible combinations and chose the combination with the highest accuracy. The classifier included at the second step was considered as the 2 nd classifier. This step was then repeated to include the 3 rd classifier and continued until all the distance matrices were included. In this way, we generated a series of models that included different numbers of distance matrices and tested their performance in the validation set. The whole procedure of dataset splitting and feature combination was repeated 10 times, and we determined the optimal feature number N at which the performance no longer improved as more matrices were added. The distance-based features were prioritized by their median ranks across 10-times feature selections, then top- N distance matrices were selected as the optimal combination for the final classifier.
We first established microbial associations to host phenotypes and metabolites ( Table S1 ) using linear and logistic mixed-effects model (joint associations): dependent variable ∼(intercept) + independent variable + age + sex + (1| time point) + (1| subject), for continuous and binary microbial traits, respectively. We further validated these joint associations by linking microbial changes to host phenotypic and metabolic changes with a regression model (delta associations): dependent variable changes ∼(intercept) + independent variable changes + age + sex, for continuous and binary microbial traits (dSVs), respectively. For the delta association of disease and medication phenotypes, we focused on disease onsets and new drug users and selected the healthy individuals and non-drug users at both times as controls. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to control FDR ( Benjamini et al., 2001 7. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Drai, D. ∙ Elmer, G. ... Controlling the false discovery rate in behavior genetics research Behav. Brain Res. 2001; 125 :279-284 Crossref Scopus (2969) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For phenotypic and metabolic associations to the same microbial feature, we first checked whether the human phenotype was associated with the metabolite using both joint and delta association models, as described above. Next, bi-directional mediation analysis was carried out using the mediate function from the R package mediation (version 4.5.0) to infer the causal role of the microbiome in contributing to the human phenotype through metabolites. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to control FDR.
